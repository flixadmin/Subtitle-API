not to trust the cops.

And if we bid officially,
alarms may have sound

492
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,512
and entreat you
to return the knife to me.

493
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,677
You say this knife
is important to your country.

494
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,480
Please explain.

495
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,560
(LIGHT CHUCKLE)

496
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,158
There is an ancient story
amongst <i>my</i> people

497
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,549
of a man who could not die.

498
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,750
In his time,
he committed terrible acts.

499
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,358
Raised a great kingdom.

500
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,600
And then vanished.

501
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,320
What happened to him?

502
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,354
If the legend is to be believed.

503
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,593
He walked away from his throne,
vowing that one day he would return

504
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,637
and complete his destiny.

505
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,516
But that would require
a particular knife.

506
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,669
This knife.

507
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,075
A story.

508
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,320
As I said.

509
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,349
But to my people.

510
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,189
Very meaningful.

511
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,671
I hope that satisfies your curiosity.

512
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,360
Some.

513
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,949
But you see, Minister,

514
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,835
my chief concern

515
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,553
is there's a boy,
the grandson of the curator.

516
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,280
He's being hunted.

517
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,720
Now, perhaps
that's because of the knife.

518
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,360
Or perhaps.

519
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,953
The killer thinks he saw something.

520
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Did he?

521
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,600
No.

522
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,397
- Then he's safe.
- Yes, but you see.

523
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,551
I would have to know that
for certain

524
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,836
before I would do anything
that might affect the case.

525
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,470
Such as release the knife.

526
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,032
May I see the knife, Detective?

527
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,355
It would so set my mind at ease.

528

529

Gordon, where the hell is Bruce?

You!

533
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,473
- Alfred, back off!
- Wait, wait! Get your hands off me.

534
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,496
You don't know
what you've got in there.

535
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,272
I'm starting to,
but you are not helping.

536
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,759
I need you to calm down.

537
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,478
- Let me finish talking to him.
- Gordon.

538
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,234
- Not now!
- Gordon!

539
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,560
He's bloody vanished.

540
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,474
He knows we don't have the knife.

541
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,555
We have to find Bruce.

542

- Donna Falcone.
- Do not call me that.

543
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,998
- You gotta hear us out.
- No, I don't.

544
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,835
I didn't invite you here.
We're not having this meeting.

545
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,919
Now I'm gonna ask you,
please, politely, to leave.

546

We served your father for years.

547
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,920
When Penguin took over,
we had to go underground.

548
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,677
Then we heard a Falcone
was back in Gotham,

549
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,360
we knew it was time.

550
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,030
Did you ignore my father
Iike you're ignoring me?

551
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,880
I just told you to leave.

552
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,256
Just tell us
when your father's coming back

553
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,600
to put that Penguin in his place.

554
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,679
Please understand me,
my father is not coming back.

555
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,955
This is Penguin's city.

556
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,075
And I want you to leave

557
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,879
- before he finds out you're here...
- Too late, I'm afraid.

558
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,480
Victor, how many graves did you dig?

559
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,320
Two.

560

You knew word would get out.

569

That my father's loyalists
would find me.

570
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,679
I was a worm on your hook.

571
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,117
With one difference, my dear.

572
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,119
The worm is usually eaten.

They cover up the smell.

576

My father wouldn't have
killed those men.

577
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,278
He would've invited me to his club.
As you did, bu! then gone further.

578
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,239
He would've invited me to dinners,

had us seen in public,

that the old order supports me.

would've pledged you loyalty.
