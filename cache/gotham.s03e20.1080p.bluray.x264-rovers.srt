1
00:00:01,992 --> 00:00:05,015
- <i>Previously on "Gotham"...</i>
- Welcome home, Bruce.

2
00:00:05,102 --> 00:00:06,375
The Court's readying a weapon

3
00:00:06,437 --> 00:00:08,515
that could destroy the city.

4
00:00:08,539 --> 00:00:10,839
You've done it.
You've weaponized the virus.

5
00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:12,307
We have to escape.

6
00:00:12,343 --> 00:00:13,842
There's only one way
that's gonna happen.

7
00:00:13,878 --> 00:00:15,811
- We work together.
- So that we may be free

8
00:00:15,846 --> 00:00:17,146
to murder each other outside.

9
00:00:19,483 --> 00:00:21,116
How do you expect to win, Oswald?

10
00:00:21,152 --> 00:00:23,919
I have an army of Hugo Strange's
monsters at my command.

11
00:00:23,954 --> 00:00:25,654
Selina!

12
00:00:25,689 --> 00:00:27,697
- Selina, stop!
- He's not Bruce!

13
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:30,759
Where is Bruce?

14
00:00:32,196 --> 00:00:33,529
Bruce is serving a greater purpose.

15
00:00:34,632 --> 00:00:35,864
We found another owl.

16
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,400
We think this map indicates
the secret hideouts of the Court.

17
00:00:38,435 --> 00:00:39,768
James Gordon.

18
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:42,805
You loved him, and
that love doomed Mario.

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,408
- But guess who's really to blame?
- I am.

20
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:50,179
We will destroy the Court of Owls

21
00:00:50,214 --> 00:00:53,515
and then you will do whatever I say.

22
00:00:53,551 --> 00:00:55,350
- Won't you?
- Yes.

23
00:00:55,386 --> 00:00:57,753
The virus sample
we got from Hugo Strange,

24
00:00:57,799 --> 00:00:59,265
- it's gone.
- Maybe Lucius took it.

25
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:01,657
No, Lee has it, too.

26
00:01:15,306 --> 00:01:19,455
The day of judgment has come to Gotham.

27
00:01:19,651 --> 00:01:22,924
And to the Court of Owls.

28
00:01:23,781 --> 00:01:27,516
Three years ago,
a great crime was committed.

29
00:01:27,883 --> 00:01:31,242
Thomas and Martha Wayne were murdered.

30
00:01:31,388 --> 00:01:34,990
Their blood is on the Court's hands.

31
00:01:35,351 --> 00:01:37,686
On your hands.

32
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,195
Thomas Wayne stood against the Court.

33
00:01:40,522 --> 00:01:42,431
He threatened to expose us.

34
00:01:42,577 --> 00:01:44,514
He paid the price.

35
00:01:44,725 --> 00:01:46,168
And my mother?

36
00:01:49,188 --> 00:01:51,194
She had to die as well?

37
00:01:52,733 --> 00:01:54,561
Why is Bruce Wayne here?

38
00:01:54,669 --> 00:01:57,264
He has come to pass judgment.

39
00:01:58,795 --> 00:02:00,394
Enough of this.

40
00:02:00,594 --> 00:02:02,026
You are the leader of the Court.

41
00:02:02,086 --> 00:02:03,684
No one disputes that.

42
00:02:03,785 --> 00:02:07,082
But you absent yourself from
Gotham for years at a time.

43
00:02:07,157 --> 00:02:09,348
Decisions had to be made.

44
00:02:10,027 --> 00:02:12,708
The ruling council
stands by its actions.

45
00:02:16,867 --> 00:02:18,767
They were your parents, Bruce.

46
00:02:18,802 --> 00:02:22,070
You knelt in their blood
that night in the alley.

47
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:25,939
Let blood avenge blood.

48
00:02:26,304 --> 00:02:27,770
Give the order.

49
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:02,862
You hesitated.

50
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,659
Next time, I won't.

51
00:03:11,155 --> 00:03:12,487
I promise.

52
00:03:12,523 --> 00:03:15,056
Mm. Mm.

53
00:03:15,806 --> 00:03:17,377
No,

54
00:03:17,853 --> 00:03:19,895
I know you won't.

55
00:03:21,365 --> 00:03:23,142
Mm.

56
00:03:44,021 --> 00:03:47,381
- Keep me informed.
- Bullock, any word from Bruce?

57
00:03:47,467 --> 00:03:49,024
Alvarez said he wasn't at that location,

58
00:03:49,059 --> 00:03:51,259
but they're checking out
the next black site on the map.

59
00:03:51,295 --> 00:03:53,495
All right, everybody knows the score.

60
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,998
The Court of Owls is planning
an attack on the city.

61
00:03:56,033 --> 00:03:57,532
They've kidnapped Bruce Wayne.

62
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,401
And now they know we're coming for them.

63
00:03:59,436 --> 00:04:01,985
So be ready for anything. Let's go.

64
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,598
This is the ruling council.

65
00:04:08,661 --> 00:04:09,894
Who could've done this?

66
00:04:09,984 --> 00:04:11,817
Straight up execution.

67
00:04:15,285 --> 00:04:16,867
Gordon.

68
00:04:16,954 --> 00:04:18,220
We got a breather.

69
00:04:22,626 --> 00:04:24,793
Gordon... traitor.

70
00:04:24,828 --> 00:04:26,261
Yeah.

71
00:04:26,296 --> 00:04:28,964
I'm a traitor. Where's Bruce Wayne?
Where's the bomb?

72
00:04:28,999 --> 00:04:31,759
We were betrayed.

73
00:04:31,902 --> 00:04:33,954
The leader, Bruce Wayne,

74
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:36,004
they killed us.

75
00:04:44,248 --> 00:04:45,647
That geezer's lying.

76
00:04:45,682 --> 00:04:47,115
If Master Bruce was in that room,

77
00:04:47,151 --> 00:04:48,984
he's being held prisoner or something

78
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:50,619
I mean, it's absurd to think

79
00:04:50,654 --> 00:04:52,387
he had anything to do with that carnage.

80
00:04:52,423 --> 00:04:54,056
I still don't get
why the leader would whack

81
00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:55,173
his own ruling council.

82
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:57,659
I mean, does this mean the virus
bomb plan thing's off?

83
00:04:57,694 --> 00:04:59,327
Until we have the bomb
in our possession,

84
00:04:59,363 --> 00:05:01,574
we have to assume the plan's still on.

85
00:05:01,965 --> 00:05:03,598
Maybe the leader was cleaning house.

86
00:05:03,634 --> 00:05:04,900
So what's the next step?

87
00:05:04,935 --> 00:05:07,969
Because we hit every spot
on that crystal owl and all we got

88
00:05:08,005 --> 00:05:09,971
were dead people wearing owl masks.

89
00:05:10,007 --> 00:05:11,973
We run their identities,
we track their holdings,

90
00:05:12,009 --> 00:05:14,342
we see where it leads us.
It worked with Kathryn.

91
00:05:14,378 --> 00:05:16,278
Yeah? And how long's that
gonna take then, mate?

92
00:05:16,758 --> 00:05:20,148
We're all trying to find Bruce, Alfred.
We're doing everything we can.

93
00:05:20,184 --> 00:05:21,765
Well...

94
00:05:22,132 --> 00:05:24,532
if only that were enough, eh?

95
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,324
He's worried about the kid.

96
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:31,036
I don't blame him.

97
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:33,723
I have no idea how Bruce fits
into the Court's plans.

98
00:05:33,797 --> 00:05:35,223
But what we saw today,

99
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:38,700
them executing their own,
they're zealots, capable of anything.

100
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,436
Gordon, those unis you put on
Thompkins' brownstone,

101
00:05:41,472 --> 00:05:42,971
they called, she's home.

102
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,129
I know what you're thinking, brother,

103
00:05:48,301 --> 00:05:50,340
Lee stealing the virus, that's weird.

104
00:05:50,547 --> 00:05:53,036
But injecting herself? Hmm?

105
00:05:53,137 --> 00:05:54,322
This is Lee we're talking about.

106
00:05:54,377 --> 00:05:57,064
You didn't hear what she
said to me last night, Harvey.

107
00:05:57,526 --> 00:05:58,992
Okay, fine.

108
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:00,307
Go.

109
00:06:02,378 --> 00:06:04,278
I'll be back as soon as I can.

110
00:06:09,926 --> 00:06:11,618
Come again?

111
00:06:11,777 --> 00:06:15,706
I said, Oswald Cobblepot is alive.

112
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:16,990
He's lying.

113
00:06:17,026 --> 00:06:18,308
I wish that were true.

114
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,494
He disappeared for days,
and then he shows up

115
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,494
with some insane story
about him and Penguin

116
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,229
being trapped in bird cages
and escaping together?

117
00:06:25,334 --> 00:06:27,668
- What'd you say you used, pudding?
- Red Jell-O.

118
00:06:27,703 --> 00:06:29,703
How stupid do you think we are?

119
00:06:30,159 --> 00:06:31,872
You really want me to answer that?

120
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:33,312
It's a setup.

121
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:35,919
Well, you would know,

122
00:06:36,045 --> 00:06:38,112
being an expert in betrayal.

123
00:06:38,403 --> 00:06:40,347
- Keep pushing me.
- Calm down.

124
00:06:40,382 --> 00:06:43,456
Both of you. In the
interest of cooperation...

125
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:46,550
...your partner's backstabbing

126
00:06:46,651 --> 00:06:48,401
actually led to an answer
you were seeking.

127
00:06:50,393 --> 00:06:54,803
Who... controls... Gotham?

128
00:06:55,364 --> 00:06:59,193
It's an organization calling
themselves the Court of Owls.

129
00:06:59,835 --> 00:07:01,139
And?

130
00:07:01,334 --> 00:07:03,237
Who are they? What do they want?

131
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:05,305
Well, unfortunately,
my interaction was limited

132
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:07,171
to a woman named Kathryn,

133
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,747
who had a stern updo.

134
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:12,632
But I can tell you there's
no interest in the underworld.

135
00:07:12,734 --> 00:07:15,015
So, at least for now,
you shouldn't worry about them.

136
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,214
You should...

137
00:07:17,418 --> 00:07:19,222
...worry about Penguin.

138
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:21,889
I'm sorry, how is that
our problem again?

139
00:07:21,924 --> 00:07:24,358
You're the one that shot him
and dumped in the river.

140
00:07:24,393 --> 00:07:26,031
Oh, Butch.

141
00:07:26,336 --> 00:07:28,133
I knew that your hand was made of lead,

142
00:07:28,367 --> 00:07:30,797
- forgot that your brain was as well.
- Cute.

143
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,445
Thank you.

144
00:07:32,664 --> 00:07:36,506
The three of you conspired
to help me murder him.

145
00:07:37,061 --> 00:07:38,293
So in Penguin's eyes,

146
00:07:38,648 --> 00:07:40,295
we're all guilty.

147
00:07:41,665 --> 00:07:43,553
He's right.

148
00:07:44,101 --> 00:07:46,702
I'll get a team to hit
Penguin's house right away.

149
00:07:46,802 --> 00:07:48,185
Don't bother.

150
00:07:48,292 --> 00:07:50,552
He knows it's the first place we'd stop.

151
00:07:50,941 --> 00:07:53,193
He's probably stowed away
in some safe house.

152
00:07:53,344 --> 00:07:55,326
Good thing I know where they all are.

153
00:07:55,412 --> 00:07:57,493
Here we go. Together again.

154
00:07:57,615 --> 00:07:59,376
Oh, I should've told you,

155
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:02,813
Penguin's recruited an army
of Hugo Strange's monsters.

156
00:08:09,249 --> 00:08:10,734
Yeah, we'll see.

157
00:08:10,794 --> 00:08:13,242
I'll take it from here.
Head back to the station.

158
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:30,245
Lee?

159
00:08:32,183 --> 00:08:33,448
It's Jim.

160
00:08:35,252 --> 00:08:36,485
Lee?

161
00:08:42,259 --> 00:08:43,492
Lee?

162
00:08:50,728 --> 00:08:52,267
Hello, Jim.

163
00:08:57,032 --> 00:08:58,893
I knew you'd come.

164
00:09:05,347 --> 00:09:07,030
Are you surprised?

165
00:09:07,609 --> 00:09:09,609
You look surprised.

166
00:09:10,257 --> 00:09:14,130
There's been a squad car
outside my house all morning.

167
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:17,200
That tells me you knew
I stole the virus.

168
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:19,731
Thought you'd assume I'd inject myself.

169
00:09:21,882 --> 00:09:23,449
I'd hoped I was wrong.

170
00:09:23,492 --> 00:09:25,020
Well, that'll teach you.

171
00:09:25,176 --> 00:09:27,473
Can I get you something? I know
how you like your whiskey.

172
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,730
Why'd you do this?

173
00:09:30,009 --> 00:09:31,782
You know why, Jim.

174
00:09:32,712 --> 00:09:35,470
You blame yourself over
what happened to Mario?

175
00:09:35,771 --> 00:09:37,804
You didn't shoot him,
you didn't infect him.

176
00:09:38,355 --> 00:09:40,024
Wasn't your fault.

177
00:09:41,024 --> 00:09:43,298
I'd have to disagree
with you on that one.

178
00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:45,946
But, honestly, the whole
argument is moot at this point.

179
00:09:45,981 --> 00:09:48,013
No, it isn't, Barnes was infected

180
00:09:48,058 --> 00:09:50,535
for weeks before the
virus fully took hold.

181
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:52,271
We can get you help.

182
00:09:52,688 --> 00:09:54,281
I'm no virologist, but I'd say

183
00:09:54,359 --> 00:09:56,398
we missed the boat on that one.

184
00:09:56,992 --> 00:09:58,499
Come on, we can fight this.

185
00:09:58,572 --> 00:10:00,023
Come with me.

186
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,522
Don't you want to know what the virus
has brought out in me, Jim?

187
00:10:07,836 --> 00:10:09,269
What it's shown me?

188
00:10:09,951 --> 00:10:11,412
No.

189
00:10:13,108 --> 00:10:15,045
My love for you.

190
00:10:18,313 --> 00:10:20,347
It's pretty obvious
when you think about it.

191
00:10:21,042 --> 00:10:23,229
Perfect Dr. Lee Thompkins.

192
00:10:23,526 --> 00:10:26,972
Why would she be drawn to a
man with so much darkness?

193
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:29,909
Such an appetite for violence?

194
00:10:29,992 --> 00:10:34,115
Unless something inside her... liked it.

195
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,419
Craved it.

196
00:10:38,591 --> 00:10:39,997
Needed it.

197
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,313
That's not true.

198
00:10:44,006 --> 00:10:48,430
The virus has shown me how
to give in to my deepest desires.

199
00:10:49,745 --> 00:10:51,790
And I will no longer deny myself

200
00:10:52,391 --> 00:10:54,405
what I really want.

201
00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:03,101
There's a problem, though,
Jim, isn't there?

202
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:06,415
You know what the problem is, don't you?

203
00:11:06,463 --> 00:11:07,596
Yeah, you need help.

204
00:11:07,643 --> 00:11:10,486
No, the problem...

205
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:12,851
is that you are always denying yourself

206
00:11:12,921 --> 00:11:14,616
who you really are.

207
00:11:15,874 --> 00:11:17,451
But I can help you with that.

208
00:11:17,545 --> 00:11:19,803
You see, Jim, I have a secret.

209
00:11:27,364 --> 00:11:29,364
Harvey, I found something.

210
00:11:29,952 --> 00:11:32,085
Right. This is a mock-up
of the map that Lucius made

211
00:11:32,121 --> 00:11:33,896
of all the Court's black sites, right?

212
00:11:33,982 --> 00:11:35,333
One problem.

213
00:11:35,427 --> 00:11:38,058
The place where Bruce and I found
the original crystal owl

214
00:11:38,093 --> 00:11:39,259
should be here.

215
00:11:39,294 --> 00:11:40,654
Marked.

216
00:11:41,052 --> 00:11:42,262
But it's not.

217
00:11:43,325 --> 00:11:45,499
Well, maybe it's an old owl
that hasn't been updated.

218
00:11:45,534 --> 00:11:47,864
No, mate, no. You're missing
the point. No, look.

219
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:50,537
The Court hasn't marked all hideouts.

220
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:54,193
So how did you find the house
when you stole the owl?

221
00:11:55,043 --> 00:11:56,693
Well, it was this little, uh,

222
00:11:56,945 --> 00:11:59,646
Ukrainian smuggling firm
called the Whisper Gang.

223
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,943
And you're thinking that maybe
they know of other locations?

224
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:04,872
Do you know where
we can find these clowns?

225
00:12:05,146 --> 00:12:06,622
I do.

226
00:12:07,656 --> 00:12:09,665
If there's any left alive.

227
00:12:15,524 --> 00:12:17,194
What's he so angry about?

228
00:12:19,001 --> 00:12:21,408
Oh, we hunted down these freaks

229
00:12:21,455 --> 00:12:23,814
- to help him destroy Nygma and Barbara.
- Mm-hmm.

230
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,205
We got this Freeze guy

231
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,607
and your pal Bridgit,
who does the... the fire thing.

232
00:12:27,643 --> 00:12:29,307
Wait, you found Bridgit?

233
00:12:29,745 --> 00:12:31,411
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

234
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:32,979
Pengy disappeared the other day,

235
00:12:33,022 --> 00:12:34,390
and she and Freeze figured
he wasn't coming back,

236
00:12:34,483 --> 00:12:35,882
so they split.

237
00:12:36,179 --> 00:12:38,734
- Can you find her?
- Why?

238
00:12:38,921 --> 00:12:41,980
There is a war coming
between me, Ed Nygma,

239
00:12:42,005 --> 00:12:43,156
and Barbara Kean.

240
00:12:43,192 --> 00:12:44,324
I need my army.

241
00:12:44,794 --> 00:12:46,685
What's in it for me?

242
00:12:47,341 --> 00:12:49,095
My gratitude.

243
00:12:49,131 --> 00:12:50,441
Hmm.

244
00:12:50,599 --> 00:12:51,765
Fine.

245
00:12:55,261 --> 00:12:56,603
Uh, you guys,

246
00:12:56,638 --> 00:12:58,588
we got company... not the good kind.

247
00:12:58,613 --> 00:12:59,905
Ivy, let's go.

248
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,408
Well, I can't leave Penguin.

249
00:13:01,443 --> 00:13:03,390
Oh, suit yourself.

250
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,955
You do have a way out, right?

251
00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:07,567
Of course. This is a safe house.

252
00:13:08,676 --> 00:13:10,217
Oswald!

253
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:13,353
Edward.

254
00:13:14,556 --> 00:13:17,417
No army of monsters, huh? Such a shame.

255
00:13:18,073 --> 00:13:21,104
- You want to kill him, or can I?
- Wait.

256
00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:29,041
Something's wrong.

257
00:13:29,128 --> 00:13:30,804
Oh, Ed.

258
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,273
So smart.

259
00:13:38,676 --> 00:13:40,480
No!

260
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:42,349
Damn it!

261
00:13:42,566 --> 00:13:44,098
Bravo, Oswald!

262
00:13:45,671 --> 00:13:47,850
But you're just delaying the inevitable.

263
00:13:48,311 --> 00:13:49,823
Where's your far better half?

264
00:13:54,677 --> 00:13:56,134
Where you going, kitty cat?

265
00:14:07,751 --> 00:14:09,611
Bruce.

266
00:14:13,501 --> 00:14:16,249
What were you thinking about?

267
00:14:17,965 --> 00:14:19,297
My parents.

268
00:14:20,789 --> 00:14:23,149
I've wanted justice for them
for so long.

269
00:14:24,774 --> 00:14:26,733
And now that I've achieved it...

270
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,420
What do you feel?

271
00:14:33,602 --> 00:14:34,934
Failure.

272
00:14:36,036 --> 00:14:38,091
I did not give the order.

273
00:14:38,903 --> 00:14:40,528
You will get another chance

274
00:14:40,599 --> 00:14:42,525
to prove yourself worthy.

275
00:14:48,216 --> 00:14:49,949
Hello, Bruce.

276
00:14:51,637 --> 00:14:54,192
It is good to see you again.

277
00:14:54,632 --> 00:14:56,232
Hello, Professor.

278
00:14:58,093 --> 00:14:59,770
Fascinating.

279
00:15:00,145 --> 00:15:03,563
He's completely docile.

280
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:06,839
I'd like to hear your techniques,

281
00:15:07,565 --> 00:15:08,935
sensei.

282
00:15:09,706 --> 00:15:11,271
One day, Professor.

283
00:15:12,775 --> 00:15:14,240
Show me the weapon.

284
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,827
I told you, Bruce,
that I did not serve the Court.

285
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:30,753
I... we made use of the Court

286
00:15:30,793 --> 00:15:33,012
for our own ends.

287
00:15:33,128 --> 00:15:35,895
The one I serve believes
you have a great destiny.

288
00:15:35,931 --> 00:15:38,665
My task has been to prepare you for it,

289
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,812
but a final step remains
in your journey.

290
00:15:49,711 --> 00:15:53,194
This detonator will trigger the bomb.

291
00:15:53,358 --> 00:15:56,170
Thousands will be
infected with the virus,

292
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,418
the city will be torn apart,

293
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:01,238
and out of the ashes...

294
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:05,106
a dark hero will rise.

295
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,746
You.

296
00:16:07,012 --> 00:16:08,364
Mm.

297
00:16:11,744 --> 00:16:15,154
When the time comes, you
must press this button.

298
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:18,805
Are you ready to embrace
your destiny, Bruce?

299
00:16:19,357 --> 00:16:20,840
Yes.

300
00:16:23,373 --> 00:16:25,745
Gotham must fall.

301
00:16:33,417 --> 00:16:35,947
Jim, me and Alfred got
a possible location on Bruce

302
00:16:36,017 --> 00:16:38,111
from a bunch of Ukrainian
yucks wearing muzzles,

303
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,352
if you can believe it.

304
00:16:39,397 --> 00:16:40,929
Give me a call when you can.

305
00:16:40,981 --> 00:16:43,601
- Where the hell is Gordon, anyway?
- He had to do something.

306
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:51,038
We're gonna have to give you a badge
or something one of these days.

307
00:17:00,524 --> 00:17:05,313
Please be very careful with this.

308
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:10,461
GCPD! Nobody...

309
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,247
Go get Bruce!

310
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:19,839
Don't move a muscle.

311
00:17:20,011 --> 00:17:23,120
Obviously, I surrender.

312
00:17:26,577 --> 00:17:28,677
You know where to take it.

313
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:30,381
Bruce!

314
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,410
Oh, thank God.

315
00:17:34,816 --> 00:17:37,089
So you're the top boy, are you?

316
00:17:37,722 --> 00:17:39,056
The leader?

317
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:43,594
Step away from Bruce, or I swear to God

318
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:45,550
I will shoot you straight in the face.

319
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:49,698
You had best put down
the weapon, Mr. Pennyworth.

320
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:52,271
Not bloody likely, mate.

321
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:57,654
Bruce?

322
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,401
Bruce, get out of the light.

323
00:18:03,597 --> 00:18:05,120
No, Alfred.

324
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:07,604
I will not let you hurt him.

325
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:10,762
What's he done to you?

326
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:14,184
He has lifted the burden of my past.

327
00:18:14,669 --> 00:18:16,926
Revealed my true destiny.

328
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,765
Gotham must fall by my hand.

329
00:18:23,718 --> 00:18:25,280
No.

330
00:18:25,561 --> 00:18:26,837
Bruce!

331
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,409
- Dwayne.
- Yes, sir.

332
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:42,686
Hey, Steve, put this animal in a cage.

333
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:45,580
I'll be back
to bust your head in a minute.

334
00:18:52,891 --> 00:18:54,844
Alfred, hey.

335
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:56,600
Are you okay?

336
00:18:56,946 --> 00:18:58,891
Far from it.

337
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:00,504
I mean, the leader of the Court

338
00:19:00,547 --> 00:19:01,972
has turned Bruce into
some kind of, like,

339
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:03,373
weird zombie zealot.

340
00:19:03,719 --> 00:19:06,828
I mean, I wouldn't have believed it
if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes.

341
00:19:06,922 --> 00:19:09,113
I think he wants Bruce
to detonate the bomb.

342
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,028
- What?!
- Bruce said something about

343
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:13,083
it being his destiny.

344
00:19:13,544 --> 00:19:15,958
How Gotham must fall by his hand.

345
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:17,560
This is bad.

346
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:19,825
We got to find that friggin' bomb.

347
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,154
Let's go see baldy-locks
and see what he can tell us.

348
00:19:22,224 --> 00:19:23,460
Harvey.

349
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:24,962
Heard from the unis at Doc Thompkins'.

350
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,638
No sign of her or Gordon or his car.

351
00:19:27,075 --> 00:19:29,234
Put a BOLO out on Jim Gordon.

352
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:32,979
- And put one out on Lee Thompkins, too.
- I'm right here, Harvey.

353
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:41,912
Lee. Hey.

354
00:19:44,001 --> 00:19:45,382
It's good to see you.

355
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:51,836
You wouldn't happen to know
where Jim is, would you?

356
00:19:51,961 --> 00:19:55,343
As a matter of fact,
he's probably waking up

357
00:19:55,914 --> 00:20:00,537
right about now.

358
00:20:52,767 --> 00:20:54,329
Lee.

359
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:58,087
Lee.

360
00:20:58,884 --> 00:21:01,725
Lee...!

361
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:03,949
Lee...

362
00:21:04,082 --> 00:21:07,731
Lee! Lee...!

363
00:21:08,004 --> 00:21:10,394
Lee!

364
00:21:16,551 --> 00:21:20,106
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Take it easy, everybody.

365
00:21:20,191 --> 00:21:22,822
Guns down, people. It's all right.

366
00:21:22,869 --> 00:21:24,744
Everybody just step back.

367
00:21:26,908 --> 00:21:29,158
You really did it, huh?

368
00:21:29,567 --> 00:21:31,471
You injected yourself with the virus?

369
00:21:31,526 --> 00:21:33,846
You're just like Jim, you seem
to think it's a bad thing.

370
00:21:34,244 --> 00:21:35,760
Where is he?

371
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,045
He went to see you at your brownstone,

372
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,382
and now we can't get in touch with him.

373
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:41,944
Well, look at you,
all worried about your hero.

374
00:21:42,331 --> 00:21:44,339
You put him up on this pedestal,

375
00:21:44,417 --> 00:21:46,602
forced him to deny his true self.

376
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:51,680
I am going to free Jim
and show everyone who he really is.

377
00:21:51,756 --> 00:21:53,722
Where the hell is he?

378
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,127
He's in a coffin, six feet underground.

379
00:22:00,831 --> 00:22:02,398
Did you kill him?

380
00:22:04,035 --> 00:22:05,879
Who said anything about killing him?

381
00:22:06,863 --> 00:22:08,629
Oh, bloody hell.

382
00:22:08,918 --> 00:22:11,113
I said he was in a coffin.

383
00:22:11,342 --> 00:22:12,942
He's not dead.

384
00:22:13,043 --> 00:22:14,089
Not yet.

385
00:22:16,527 --> 00:22:18,512
Oh, geez.

386
00:22:19,902 --> 00:22:23,201
I forgot how jumpy
everybody is around here.

387
00:22:23,941 --> 00:22:25,574
Jim, are you there?

388
00:22:27,122 --> 00:22:29,004
<i>Jim, you there?</i>

389
00:22:31,442 --> 00:22:33,441
Lee, what the hell are you doing?

390
00:22:33,677 --> 00:22:34,743
<i>Stay calm.</i>

391
00:22:35,043 --> 00:22:36,878
<i>You've got to conserve your air.</i>

392
00:22:37,253 --> 00:22:39,114
Listen to me...

393
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,083
Little late for that.

394
00:22:41,118 --> 00:22:43,118
<i>Why don't you say hi
to Harvey and the gang?</i>

395
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,727
Harvey? You there?

396
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:47,616
We're here, buddy. Where are you?

397
00:22:47,819 --> 00:22:49,476
<i>Harvey, she's got the virus.</i>

398
00:22:49,507 --> 00:22:51,116
- <i>She's buried me alive...</i>
- Shh.

399
00:22:51,796 --> 00:22:53,265
<i>I do the talking.</i>

400
00:22:53,387 --> 00:22:54,719
<i>Now, if you're quiet,</i>

401
00:22:54,796 --> 00:22:56,187
<i>I'll let you listen.</i>

402
00:22:56,817 --> 00:22:58,390
So, here's the deal.

403
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:02,871
I buried Jim Gordon alive

404
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:06,064
in a location that you might
find if you looked long enough,

405
00:23:06,224 --> 00:23:07,966
but certainly not
before he runs out of air.

406
00:23:08,193 --> 00:23:11,279
<i>Meaning, I'm the only one
who knows where he is.</i>

407
00:23:11,405 --> 00:23:12,737
But...

408
00:23:12,841 --> 00:23:14,810
now here's the kicker...

409
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,220
I left him a way out.

410
00:23:18,838 --> 00:23:20,545
You hear that, Jim?

411
00:23:21,306 --> 00:23:25,111
<i>I left you an escape hatch.
Have you found it yet?</i>

412
00:23:28,722 --> 00:23:30,594
<i>You should've found it by now.</i>

413
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:43,668
You left me the virus.

414
00:23:45,287 --> 00:23:48,740
I told you I would help you
find your darkness.

415
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,241
Now,

416
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:52,085
<i>I can't do it for you.</i>

417
00:23:52,374 --> 00:23:54,179
<i>You've got to do it yourself.</i>

418
00:23:54,304 --> 00:23:57,593
I won't. I won't do it, Lee.

419
00:23:58,062 --> 00:24:00,623
You've got two options.

420
00:24:00,921 --> 00:24:02,387
You can take the virus,

421
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,873
<i>and find the strength
and get out of there,</i>

422
00:24:05,099 --> 00:24:08,760
or you can make that coffin
your permanent home.

423
00:24:08,795 --> 00:24:10,529
Lee, please. Please.

424
00:24:10,873 --> 00:24:14,998
In the name of all
that is holy and not insane...

425
00:24:16,103 --> 00:24:17,787
...tell us where he is.

426
00:24:18,071 --> 00:24:20,516
I swear to God, I'll let you
walk right out of here.

427
00:24:20,703 --> 00:24:22,303
Tell us where you buried him.

428
00:24:22,367 --> 00:24:24,571
Why would I want to walk
out of here, Harvey?

429
00:24:25,203 --> 00:24:28,413
I'm gonna miss the look
on all of your faces

430
00:24:28,448 --> 00:24:30,115
when he takes that virus.

431
00:24:30,289 --> 00:24:33,646
And seeing that he's got roughly
an hour left of oxygen,

432
00:24:34,037 --> 00:24:36,209
I'm not gonna have long to wait.

433
00:24:43,188 --> 00:24:44,996
Can I get a cup of coffee?

434
00:24:46,368 --> 00:24:48,508
Get the lady a cup of coffee.

435
00:24:48,844 --> 00:24:49,968
Put her in a cell.

436
00:24:53,173 --> 00:24:55,240
Don't worry, I'm not gonna bite.

437
00:24:56,843 --> 00:24:59,901
All right, everyone,
Bruce Wayne is still missing.

438
00:24:59,949 --> 00:25:01,543
There's still a freaking
terrorist attack

439
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:04,182
that could go down at any minute,
so get back to your jobs,

440
00:25:04,262 --> 00:25:07,819
do what you're supposed to be doing.
Let me worry about Jim Gordon.

441
00:25:23,503 --> 00:25:24,719
<i>Jim.</i>

442
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,137
<i>It's me. You there, buddy?</i>

443
00:25:26,212 --> 00:25:27,505
Harvey.

444
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,502
These radios run
on a shortwave frequency.

445
00:25:30,527 --> 00:25:32,676
<i>I've got to be close.
Get it over to Lucius.</i>

446
00:25:32,746 --> 00:25:34,779
He should be able to run down
a general fix.

447
00:25:35,152 --> 00:25:36,431
Hang tight, we're on it.

448
00:25:36,551 --> 00:25:37,682
Let's go.

449
00:25:38,004 --> 00:25:39,457
All right.

450
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:43,397
Conserve your breath.

451
00:25:44,217 --> 00:25:45,959
Stay calm.

452
00:25:57,335 --> 00:25:59,390
I'm not working for Penguin.

453
00:25:59,429 --> 00:26:01,256
So you were just holed up
together for kicks?

454
00:26:01,311 --> 00:26:02,889
No.

455
00:26:03,006 --> 00:26:05,335
- Ivy just asked me to come by.
- Why?

456
00:26:05,866 --> 00:26:07,502
None of your business, lunk.

457
00:26:08,336 --> 00:26:10,085
Now I got to take lip off a kid?

458
00:26:12,189 --> 00:26:14,290
You're friends with
that firebug, aren't you?

459
00:26:14,346 --> 00:26:15,788
Her name's Bridgit.

460
00:26:21,069 --> 00:26:23,960
Penguin's army of monsters deserted him.

461
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:27,135
And he needed your help finding them.

462
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:30,673
You're gonna tell Penguin
that you know where this Bridgit is

463
00:26:30,708 --> 00:26:32,642
and that you'd like to meet.

464
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:34,343
And we'll take care of the rest.

465
00:26:35,699 --> 00:26:37,253
Fine.

466
00:26:37,464 --> 00:26:40,246
But I need cash to get out of town.

467
00:26:41,636 --> 00:26:44,887
- Fine.
- And nothing happens to Ivy.

468
00:26:46,746 --> 00:26:49,358
She's stupid, but not a traitor.

469
00:26:49,804 --> 00:26:52,361
Those things aren't mutually exclusive.

470
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:55,864
Shoo. The grown-ups need to talk.

471
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,033
Oh, and forgive me if I don't
want you knowing the details.

472
00:26:58,069 --> 00:27:00,469
That didn't work out so well last time.

473
00:27:02,098 --> 00:27:03,572
Bye, now.

474
00:27:06,046 --> 00:27:08,780
How much longer
are we gonna put up with this?

475
00:27:13,668 --> 00:27:15,207
<i>Jim.</i>

476
00:27:15,486 --> 00:27:16,952
Harvey, what'd you find?

477
00:27:16,988 --> 00:27:18,487
<i>You were right about the walkie.</i>

478
00:27:18,522 --> 00:27:20,074
It's got a one mile radius.

479
00:27:20,128 --> 00:27:22,355
Lucius couldn't trace a signal,
but when we looked at a map,

480
00:27:22,417 --> 00:27:24,293
we figured there was only
one place she could take you:

481
00:27:24,328 --> 00:27:25,332
Jackson Park.

482
00:27:26,271 --> 00:27:29,191
I should've known.
But that's nothing but dense forest.

483
00:27:29,216 --> 00:27:30,771
- <i>You'll never...</i>
- It's a place to start.

484
00:27:30,835 --> 00:27:32,742
We're gonna find you, brother,
I promise.

485
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:34,953
Harvey. Listen, I know he's your mate,

486
00:27:35,015 --> 00:27:36,406
but with everything else
that's going on,

487
00:27:36,469 --> 00:27:38,820
with Bruce missing, the bomb,

488
00:27:39,219 --> 00:27:42,144
you certain searching for Jim
is the best use of your time?

489
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:44,952
If the situation were reversed,
he'd do the same for me.

490
00:27:45,077 --> 00:27:46,582
Besides, I got you.

491
00:27:46,812 --> 00:27:48,780
- What do you mean?
- I want you to squeeze Strange,

492
00:27:48,835 --> 00:27:50,101
find out everything he knows.

493
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,234
I saw how you dealt
with that Kathryn bird.

494
00:27:52,265 --> 00:27:54,817
- You like to get your hands dirty.
- Wait, are you sure about this, mate?

495
00:27:54,842 --> 00:27:56,809
I want you to get your hands
really dirty.

496
00:27:57,286 --> 00:27:59,862
I want you to find out where
the leader's taking Bruce.

497
00:27:59,975 --> 00:28:01,730
Find the bomb,
and however much or little

498
00:28:01,766 --> 00:28:04,266
is left of Strange after that,
even if it's just a pinky,

499
00:28:04,346 --> 00:28:06,084
we will throw in jail.

500
00:28:06,737 --> 00:28:08,647
Thanks.

501
00:28:09,147 --> 00:28:10,372
Campos.

502
00:28:10,573 --> 00:28:14,243
Call the K-9 unit, have them meet us
in Jackson Park, now!

503
00:28:14,518 --> 00:28:16,300
You can't save him, Harvey.

504
00:28:16,414 --> 00:28:18,159
He's gonna take the virus.

505
00:28:18,249 --> 00:28:21,147
And we're gonna be together
the way we were meant to be!

506
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:24,412
It's gonna be beautiful.

507
00:28:31,765 --> 00:28:33,023
Get off.

508
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:37,017
I find this shouting
and screaming deeply upsetting.

509
00:28:37,053 --> 00:28:38,911
It affects my concentration.

510
00:28:39,055 --> 00:28:40,187
And my grip!

511
00:28:42,468 --> 00:28:45,387
Please. Don't let me fall.

512
00:28:45,461 --> 00:28:48,992
We can discuss this
in a civilized manner!

513
00:28:49,062 --> 00:28:50,975
Oh, that's rich, coming
from the likes of you.

514
00:28:51,968 --> 00:28:53,534
Who's about to poison
thousands of people

515
00:28:53,569 --> 00:28:55,929
and turn them into raving lunatics!

516
00:28:56,572 --> 00:28:58,925
Now, where is Bruce Wayne?

517
00:28:58,975 --> 00:29:01,464
And where is the bomb?

518
00:29:02,526 --> 00:29:05,456
If I tell you, you drop me.

519
00:29:05,581 --> 00:29:09,174
I end up dead, either way.

520
00:29:10,135 --> 00:29:12,086
Self-preservation, is it?

521
00:29:12,143 --> 00:29:14,940
That's your game?
All right, then, Humpty.

522
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:18,425
I got a swapsie for you.

523
00:29:18,461 --> 00:29:20,060
Down you pop.

524
00:29:22,898 --> 00:29:26,106
Your freedom for Bruce Wayne.

525
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:29,436
You don't have
the authority to let me go.

526
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:30,905
I didn't have the authority
just to hang you

527
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,140
off the side of a bloody building, did I?!

528
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:36,904
Hey, see that fire escape over there?

529
00:29:37,014 --> 00:29:38,412
That leads directly to the street

530
00:29:38,447 --> 00:29:40,347
and to your freedom.
Now, I won't stop you.

531
00:29:43,966 --> 00:29:46,989
I just want to know where my boy is.

532
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:50,024
All right.

533
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:57,298
The leader has taken Bruce
to Wayne Enterprises.

534
00:29:57,564 --> 00:29:59,587
They'll have a view of the street below

535
00:29:59,634 --> 00:30:02,169
as it fills with people
affected by the virus,

536
00:30:02,204 --> 00:30:04,446
- but you're too late.
- Why?

537
00:30:05,009 --> 00:30:06,743
What time is the bomb going off?

538
00:30:06,821 --> 00:30:09,150
5:00 p.m., but that's not what I mean.

539
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:13,114
The Bruce Wayne you know is gone.

540
00:30:14,483 --> 00:30:17,380
His mind is no longer his own.

541
00:30:21,223 --> 00:30:22,785
Oh, you're so wrong.

542
00:30:23,809 --> 00:30:26,840
You have got no idea
how strong that boy is.

543
00:30:28,624 --> 00:30:30,527
Now, I'm a man of my word.

544
00:30:31,754 --> 00:30:33,018
You can walk.

545
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:34,931
Just as soon as you wake up.

546
00:30:35,037 --> 00:30:36,127
I don't know what you mean...

547
00:30:39,205 --> 00:30:40,815
Slag.

548
00:30:45,548 --> 00:30:47,903
You seem troubled.

549
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:55,284
I hope it was not the encounter
with your manservant.

550
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:56,912
No.

551
00:30:58,918 --> 00:31:01,260
If this is my destiny,

552
00:31:02,088 --> 00:31:03,845
I do not want to fail.

553
00:31:05,441 --> 00:31:07,598
You won't, Bruce.

554
00:31:08,145 --> 00:31:09,637
All this,

555
00:31:10,106 --> 00:31:12,873
everything the Court of Owls
set in motion,

556
00:31:12,908 --> 00:31:17,424
everything I have done, has been
to prepare you for this moment,

557
00:31:17,493 --> 00:31:18,940
and afterward,

558
00:31:19,823 --> 00:31:23,550
I will bring you to the one
whose vision has singled you out.

559
00:31:25,015 --> 00:31:27,531
He is very eager to meet you.

560
00:31:41,564 --> 00:31:43,000
Harvey.

561
00:31:43,072 --> 00:31:44,705
- <i>Anything?</i>
- Nothing yet.

562
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:47,361
Covered about 30 acres.
How you holding up?

563
00:31:47,476 --> 00:31:49,674
<i>It's getting hard to breathe.</i>

564
00:31:49,779 --> 00:31:52,416
Stay off the walkie;
you got to conserve your air.

565
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,643
<i>That shouldn't be hard.</i>

566
00:31:54,666 --> 00:31:57,386
- I'm running low on battery.
- Well, quit your yapping.

567
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:03,160
<i>Harvey, there's too much
ground to cover.</i>

568
00:32:07,129 --> 00:32:09,305
You've done everything you could.

569
00:32:12,751 --> 00:32:14,360
Okay.

570
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,383
Go to plan B.

571
00:32:17,688 --> 00:32:18,987
Take the virus.

572
00:32:19,796 --> 00:32:20,863
No.

573
00:32:20,983 --> 00:32:23,022
If you don't, you'll die.

574
00:32:23,857 --> 00:32:26,218
<i>Take the virus,
and we'll figure something out.</i>

575
00:32:42,345 --> 00:32:43,657
<i>I'm not gonna take the virus.</i>

576
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:45,783
I won't become a monster.

577
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:48,464
Hold on.

578
00:32:51,036 --> 00:32:52,235
Alfred.

579
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:55,040
<i>Strange said the bomb is due
to detonate at 5:00 p.m.</i>

580
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:57,751
5:00?! That's in, like,
20 minutes! Where?

581
00:32:57,813 --> 00:32:59,042
<i>He never said where, but he did say</i>

582
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:00,249
that the leader and Bruce are heading

583
00:33:00,274 --> 00:33:02,278
directly to Wayne Enterprises
to watch the fallout.

584
00:33:02,366 --> 00:33:05,715
<i>Now, the rooftop looks
directly onto Union Station.</i>

585
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,885
The bomb's due to go off, slap, bang,
in the middle of rush hour.

586
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,910
Wait, w-whoa, whoa! Stop!

587
00:33:10,995 --> 00:33:14,590
I want every available
uni to Union Station!

588
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,839
I want it evacuated now! Go!

589
00:33:16,886 --> 00:33:19,391
- K-9s stay with me.
 - <i>Harvey, at 5:00 p.m.,</i>

590
00:33:19,445 --> 00:33:21,230
<i>Union Station is gonna be packed.</i>

591
00:33:21,352 --> 00:33:23,900
Even with an evacuation,
thousands will be infected.

592
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:25,468
<i>Not if we find the bomb first.</i>

593
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,590
But I'm guessing it's not gonna
be sitting out in the open.

594
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:30,043
- No, it'll be hidden.
- Where?

595
00:33:33,645 --> 00:33:35,396
Yesterday, Kathryn said,

596
00:33:35,592 --> 00:33:37,693
"Gotham will fall when the clock stops."

597
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:39,974
What if she was talking
about a real clock?

598
00:33:40,294 --> 00:33:42,251
Clock tower at Union Station.

599
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:45,755
Harvey?

600
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,547
Harvey, do you hear me?

601
00:33:48,008 --> 00:33:49,997
Harvey, Harvey, you copy?

602
00:33:50,282 --> 00:33:52,470
Jim, I lost you. Jim?

603
00:33:52,793 --> 00:33:54,026
Jim!

604
00:35:04,162 --> 00:35:06,429
In the old days,
loyalty meant something.

605
00:35:07,949 --> 00:35:10,689
Don Falcone, Maroni,

606
00:35:11,669 --> 00:35:13,603
even Fish.

607
00:35:14,755 --> 00:35:18,564
They had their faults,
but they lived by codes.

608
00:35:20,533 --> 00:35:23,900
Ed Nygma, Barbara Kean...

609
00:35:24,839 --> 00:35:28,681
they wouldn't even be allowed
to sit at the same table as Don Falcone.

610
00:35:28,815 --> 00:35:32,837
And yet, here I am,
forced to demean myself

611
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,611
to do battle with them.

612
00:35:35,001 --> 00:35:37,234
Yeah, people are dumb.

613
00:35:37,751 --> 00:35:39,695
Plants are better.

614
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:44,211
You can trust them.

615
00:35:46,636 --> 00:35:49,464
I have no more safe houses.

616
00:35:49,651 --> 00:35:51,057
No monsters.

617
00:35:51,131 --> 00:35:54,895
I will not run from Ed Nygma!

618
00:35:56,317 --> 00:35:58,036
Well, actually, you have one monster.

619
00:35:58,072 --> 00:35:59,071
What?

620
00:35:59,096 --> 00:36:02,163
Selina called. She found Bridgit.

621
00:36:02,538 --> 00:36:03,771
She's gonna bring her by.

622
00:36:05,194 --> 00:36:06,573
You're joking.

623
00:36:07,781 --> 00:36:10,821
That's... wait.

624
00:36:11,619 --> 00:36:13,532
Why is Selina suddenly helping me?

625
00:36:13,654 --> 00:36:14,786
I don't know.

626
00:36:14,915 --> 00:36:16,345
She was acting kind of weird.

627
00:36:16,501 --> 00:36:18,724
Asking where we were, did we have guns.

628
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:21,577
I was like, "We're all alone, duh."

629
00:36:22,523 --> 00:36:24,363
You idiot!

630
00:36:24,491 --> 00:36:27,234
- It was a setup!
- No. No way.

631
00:36:27,288 --> 00:36:28,926
Selina would never do that.

632
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:33,438
Well, unless they offered her money.

633
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:01,232
Hello again, Oswald.

634
00:37:02,283 --> 00:37:05,212
Captain, over here.
I think I found something.

635
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,703
We got to get to Union Station.

636
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:32,497
That was Bullock.

637
00:37:32,726 --> 00:37:34,680
Gordon's on his way to Union Station.

638
00:37:34,805 --> 00:37:36,672
He's infected with the virus. Come on!

639
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:46,244
Hey...

640
00:37:52,705 --> 00:37:56,095
You must be very proud of yourself, Ed,

641
00:37:56,259 --> 00:37:57,990
thinking you outsmarted me.

642
00:37:58,142 --> 00:38:00,673
Well, frankly, it wasn't
really a challenge.

643
00:38:00,837 --> 00:38:03,983
Now, you're gonna do one
thing before you die.

644
00:38:05,467 --> 00:38:07,514
Call me...

645
00:38:08,136 --> 00:38:09,469
The Riddler.

646
00:38:13,601 --> 00:38:15,124
No.

647
00:38:15,342 --> 00:38:16,937
You have a choice, Oswald.

648
00:38:17,015 --> 00:38:20,827
This can happen real quick
or it can take hours.

649
00:38:21,472 --> 00:38:25,717
- Days. It will be...
- I'll take option "B," Ed.

650
00:38:26,167 --> 00:38:27,719
Since saying

651
00:38:27,755 --> 00:38:31,882
that ridiculous name
would be torture itself.

652
00:38:33,281 --> 00:38:34,491
Very well.

653
00:38:37,116 --> 00:38:42,656
Slow and painful it shall be.

654
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:46,726
Uh, hello? Do I get no say in all this?

655
00:38:46,843 --> 00:38:50,636
- See how it feels?
- Guys, you hear something?

656
00:38:55,649 --> 00:38:57,277
This is a trap?

657
00:38:57,641 --> 00:39:00,613
No, not exactly.

658
00:39:04,713 --> 00:39:06,103
Fish.

659
00:39:06,441 --> 00:39:08,565
Hello, Oswald.

660
00:39:10,361 --> 00:39:11,932
Now, see that there?

661
00:39:12,403 --> 00:39:14,403
That's a look of respect.

662
00:39:15,721 --> 00:39:17,307
Or is it fear?

663
00:39:17,807 --> 00:39:19,245
Hi-ya, Fish.

664
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:21,797
- How you been?
- Well, let's see.

665
00:39:22,063 --> 00:39:23,883
I was alive...

666
00:39:24,263 --> 00:39:25,562
and then I was dead.

667
00:39:27,477 --> 00:39:29,247
And then I was alive.

668
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:33,118
Things are looking up.

669
00:39:35,307 --> 00:39:38,034
My, my, my.

670
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:41,846
Now, this is quite a gathering.
You have to love Gotham.

671
00:39:41,908 --> 00:39:44,062
People always
pointing guns at each other.

672
00:39:44,275 --> 00:39:45,531
Why are you here?

673
00:39:46,234 --> 00:39:47,531
You...

674
00:39:47,768 --> 00:39:48,945
shall...

675
00:39:49,586 --> 00:39:51,437
see.

676
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:56,603
And as for you, whoever you may be,

677
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:59,103
please excuse us.

678
00:40:00,163 --> 00:40:02,384
My little penguin and I...

679
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:05,498
will be leaving.

680
00:40:10,748 --> 00:40:13,366
Please, carry on.

681
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:22,732
Woman always knew how
to make an entrance.

682
00:40:24,083 --> 00:40:25,904
<i>Attention, all passengers.</i>

683
00:40:25,966 --> 00:40:29,130
<i>This is an emergency.
Please proceed to the nearest exit.</i>

684
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:30,842
Gordon, there you are.

685
00:40:34,278 --> 00:40:36,065
<i>Attention, all passengers.</i>

686
00:40:36,139 --> 00:40:40,428
<i>This is an emergency.
Please proceed to the nearest exit.</i>

687
00:40:43,342 --> 00:40:44,756
It's time.

688
00:40:45,893 --> 00:40:47,641
Press the button.

689
00:40:48,376 --> 00:40:50,329
Claim your destiny.

690
00:40:51,141 --> 00:40:55,157
Let Gotham fall so you may rise.

691
00:41:02,397 --> 00:41:04,110
No!

692
00:41:07,178 --> 00:41:09,682
Whatever destiny he's sold you,
Bruce, he's lying.

693
00:41:09,816 --> 00:41:11,148
- Press it, Bruce.
- Don't.

694
00:41:11,494 --> 00:41:12,900
Bruce, don't.

695
00:41:13,416 --> 00:41:15,295
I won't have him turn you
into a murderer.

696
00:41:17,216 --> 00:41:19,193
<i>This is an emergency.</i>

697
00:41:19,256 --> 00:41:21,371
<i>Please proceed to the nearest exit.</i>

698
00:41:31,903 --> 00:41:34,466
Are you going to shoot me, Alfred?

699
00:41:34,906 --> 00:41:36,786
I want to help you.

700
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:40,495
We'll reverse what he's done to you.

701
00:41:41,979 --> 00:41:45,463
Bruce, if you press that detonator,
there's no coming back.

702
00:41:46,725 --> 00:41:48,014
He won't shoot you.

703
00:41:48,514 --> 00:41:51,303
He's weak, Bruce, but you are not.

704
00:41:54,731 --> 00:41:56,359
Bruce, please.

705
00:41:58,285 --> 00:42:00,029
Give me the detonator, son.

706
00:42:01,253 --> 00:42:03,295
No. You will press it.

707
00:42:09,362 --> 00:42:11,283
Hello, lover.

708
00:42:15,747 --> 00:42:17,747
I guess we're gonna have company.

709
00:42:18,315 --> 00:42:21,604
Seek out the Yuyan building.

710
00:42:21,674 --> 00:42:24,401
Find the demon's head.

711
00:42:25,018 --> 00:42:27,827
Fulfill your destiny.

712
00:42:33,334 --> 00:42:34,749
Bruce.

713
00:42:46,044 --> 00:42:48,645
When you're ready, come and find me.

714
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,356
It's only a matter of time.

715
00:43:05,263 --> 00:43:07,125
It's too late.
