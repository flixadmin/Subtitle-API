1
00:00:06,573 --> 00:00:08,707
Looks like we missed
the garage sale.

2
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:12,678
What we are looking
for is most likely
well-hidden, Jade.

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,148
According to
an 18th century text
found in a museum,

4
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:19,852
this palace was the
last known home of
the cat of Khartoum.

5
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,121
(Cat meows)

6
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:24,656
I think I hear it!

7
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:27,259
It is a statue, Jade,
not an actual--

8
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:30,229
(frustrated cries)

9
00:00:30,231 --> 00:00:33,832
Oh, kitty! Got your
little leg all caught
in palace junk?

10
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:36,335
(Meows)

11
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,937
You're welcome!

12
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:40,873
Hungry, girl?

13
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:43,275
So, what's your name?

14
00:00:43,277 --> 00:00:45,144
Rrr-bbbeee
rrr-bbbeee.

15
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,479
Ruby! Ha ha ha!

16
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:50,749
That tickles Ruby!

17
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:56,255
Odd. This tile is not as
weathered as the others.

18
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,590
Perhaps...

19
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:02,594
Ahh!

20
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:04,930
(Agitated yowls)

21
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,934
What's the matter, girl?

22
00:01:09,702 --> 00:01:11,136
Booby trap!

23
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,196
Mayday!

24
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:17,769
(Both coughing)

25
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,640
Jade, are you--

26
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:22,841
fine.

27
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:23,976
(Agitated yowl)

28
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:25,777
It's ok, Ruby.

29
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:29,248
That kind of stuff happens
all the time when you
hang out with uncle Jackie.

30
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,416
(Gasps)
- The cat of Khartoum!

31
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:34,520
That's it?

32
00:02:34,522 --> 00:02:36,855
Looks like something
you buy at a swap meet
for a buck.

33
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:39,591
Worth quite a bit more,
young lady.

34
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:41,093
(Gasps) Valmont!

35
00:02:41,095 --> 00:02:44,696
Thanks ever so
for finding the cat
for me, chan.

36
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:46,398
Now hand it over!

37
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,734
No! It belongs
to the museum!

38
00:02:48,736 --> 00:02:50,068
Yeah, so step off!

39
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,171
We almost got pancaked
looking for that thing!

40
00:02:52,173 --> 00:02:55,641
Please, let's not
compare hardships.

41
00:02:55,643 --> 00:03:00,212
My men have been combing
this disgusting pig sty
for the past 3 days,

42
00:03:00,214 --> 00:03:02,281
searching for that kitty.

43
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:07,019
Aw! Ruined my best shirt!

44
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:09,488
It's your <i> only</i> shirt.
Oh, look at my shoes!

45
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:12,524
Soon as we collect the
20 large for that kitty
statue, I'm gonna--

46
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:15,827
do put a sock in it, Finn.
Get that cat!

47
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,097
Hey! Maybe you
haven't heard,

48
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:21,066
but possession is
nine-tenths of the law!

49
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:23,936
Yeah? And this here's
the other two-tenths!

50
00:03:23,938 --> 00:03:25,871
You need to work
on your math!

51
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:28,006
Yeah? Well, my math's
good enough to know

52
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:30,442
that 3-against-1
ain't very good odds!

53
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:32,711
Spare me the gladiator scene.

54
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:35,147
Just get the merchandise!

55
00:03:35,149 --> 00:03:38,450
Yes! Keep your eye
on the kitty!

56
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:41,286
Jade: Go, Jackie!

57
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:42,788
You hit 'em high,
I'll hit 'em...

58
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:43,922
Aah!

59
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:46,725
Low.

60
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:51,063
Ooh, he's got drapery!

61
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:53,599
What you gonna do,
redecorate?

62
00:03:53,601 --> 00:03:55,133
Yes!
- Hey!
Wha--

63
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:59,004
(meows)
Jackie!

64
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,407
Ruby!
(Yowls)

65
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,542
Aah!

66
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:06,078
Ahh!

67
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,179
Ow!

68
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:09,648
Sharp little devil,
aren't you?

69
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,316
Jade, wait here!

70
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:17,623
Ohh!

71
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:22,394
Valmont,
this is very dangerous!

72
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,097
If we fall, we--

73
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:28,000
how do you do that?

74
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:30,502
It's all a matter
of balance, chan.

75
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:33,739
Case in point.

76
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:36,942
Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh.

77
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,343
Whoa--uhh!

78
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:40,312
Aah!

79
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:41,780
(Sighs)

80
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:43,148
No way.

81
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:48,086
Fantastic! I've never
felt so alive!

82
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,492
Something about
this statue, chan.

83
00:04:53,494 --> 00:04:55,093
It's good luck!

84
00:04:57,697 --> 00:05:00,265
Good luck or bad magic?

85
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:07,139
This cafe is owned
by Cardiff zendo,

86
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:10,275
the largest
collector of art
objects in tangiers,

87
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:13,345
(whispers)
And known as a very
shady character.

88
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,581
Thank you.

89
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,317
I suspect
valmont and company

90
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:19,985
will be showing up
any time now

91
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:22,154
to conduct their...
Business.

92
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:24,656
And then we take back
the cat. Right, Ruby?

93
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,224
(Meows)

94
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:29,961
Jade, you cannot
bring an animal into
a public restaurant!

95
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:31,596
It's not hygienic!

96
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:34,666
Jackie,
cats are very clean.

97
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,101
(Cell phone rings)

98
00:05:36,103 --> 00:05:37,703
Is that you, uncle?

99
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:41,807
No! It is a magazine
salesman calling you
at 5:00 in morning.

100
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:45,644
Oh! Sorry.
It's almost lunchtime here.

101
00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:48,580
Uncle has been
researching
the cat of Khartoum.

102
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:51,883
Yes, and did you
discover any unusual
legends or--

103
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:54,119
getting to that!
According to legend,

104
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:56,621
anyone who gets
scratched by claw
of statue--

105
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:58,623
becomes
like a cat himself.

106
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,126
Ooh! You already
know so much,

107
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:02,627
why you bother me?

108
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:05,964
There is one thing
I do not know, uncle.

109
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:07,366
What is the antidote?

110
00:06:07,368 --> 00:06:11,670
Antidote?! Do not
get scratched
by claw of cat!

111
00:06:11,672 --> 00:06:14,439
I mean, how do you
reverse the process?

112
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:16,208
Or, are you
getting to that?

113
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,977
No. Getting to bed.
Call you back later.

114
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:27,886
(Valmont slurping)

115
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,688
Dude, check it out.

116
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,558
Ahh!

117
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,795
Want a little
coffee with your
cream there, big v?

118
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:41,233
I'll give him one thing--
he's very tidy.

119
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:46,071
I say we collect
the dough for
this thing pronto,

120
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,372
get valmont
to a doctor.

121
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:49,141
Maybe there's
some kind of cure.

122
00:06:49,143 --> 00:06:52,010
Don't you mean
a veterinarian?

123
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:53,078
(Both stifle laughter)

124
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,815
I heard that.
In fact, my hearing

125
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:58,784
has become quite acute.

126
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,688
There is no cure
because this is
not a disease.

127
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,224
It's a transformation...

128
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:09,161
And I rather like
the new me.

129
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:15,667
Besides, why sell
to Cardiff zendo

130
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:17,302
for a mere 20 large?

131
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:19,438
This little kitty
should go to market,

132
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,974
where we can
auction it off to
the highest bidder,

133
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:24,810
or better yet...Hmm.

134
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,679
(Chuckles)

135
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:29,848
Uh, you got
a hairball, boss?

136
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,750
An inspiration.

137
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:34,186
Obviously, it was a
scratch from tabby here

138
00:07:34,188 --> 00:07:38,457
that changed me into
the glorious specimen
you now see before you.

139
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:41,426
Why not use her
to create others
like myself?

140
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:48,533
Stealth, cunning,
and the agility of a cat!

141
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:51,169
Just one tiny
scratch away, boys.

142
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:54,506
We'll be able to steal
every treasure in the world!

143
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,410
We?
- We?

144
00:07:58,412 --> 00:07:59,578
(Chuckles)

145
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,279
(Meows) Tassels!

146
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:04,416
I never realized what
pleasure they can give!

147
00:08:04,418 --> 00:08:06,351
So, what do you say?

148
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:08,687
9 lifetimes of playing
with yarn balls.

149
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:10,555
Thanks, but no thanks.

150
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:13,725
Ditto.

151
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:15,527
Perhaps in time
you'll come to see

152
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:18,129
how wonderful
the feline life can be!

153
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,772
(Meows)

154
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:30,509
Excuse me, but there's
a phone call for you,
monsieur.

155
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:31,910
For me?

156
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:34,913
Yes. You may take it
in the back.

157
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:37,449
Perhaps uncle couldn't
reach me by cell phone.

158
00:08:37,451 --> 00:08:38,783
Whatever.

159
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,654
Ha ha ha!

160
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,834
Hello?

161
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,304
Rrarr!

162
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:01,573
Did you want to
use the phone?

163
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,508
Uhh!

164
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:12,183
Uhh!
- Rrarr!

165
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:16,922
Mayday! Mayday!

166
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,592
Aah! Sorry.

167
00:09:20,594 --> 00:09:23,395
I really should be
getting back to--whoa!

168
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:26,131
Ehh! Uhh! Ehh!

169
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:27,666
Pillow fight?

170
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:29,834
Aah!

171
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,543
Heh heh!

172
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,213
Uhh!

173
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:44,816
You are going to be
in big trouble...

174
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:46,885
With the phone company.

175
00:09:46,887 --> 00:09:48,286
Rrarr!
- Ohh!

176
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:52,924
Thank you.

177
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:56,561
(Chuckles)
It is I who should
be grateful, Mr. chan.

178
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:58,430
That display case
you nearly plowed into

179
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:00,999
contains many priceless
objet d'art.

180
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:03,802
You are Cardiff zendo.

181
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,137
So I am!

182
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:09,140
My treasures,
and soon joining them,

183
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:11,676
the most marvelous
collectible of all--

184
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:13,445
the cat of Khartoum.

185
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,985
But a little birdie
tells me you are after
the statue as well.

186
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:25,457
Yes, and I am sure
my niece has
located it by now.

187
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,325
If you like,
I will go and
find her, and--

188
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:29,361
that won't be necessary.

189
00:10:29,363 --> 00:10:32,597
Get your hands off me
or I'll--I'll--

190
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:34,032
you don't even
want to know!

191
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:35,467
Let her go!

192
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,470
Yes, do let her go.

193
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:41,039
(Meows)

194
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:44,843
You have just given me
the most delightful
idea, Mr. chan--

195
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:47,312
one that will
benefit us mutually.

196
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:49,280
What?

197
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:52,384
Based upon the late hour,
I can only surmise

198
00:10:52,386 --> 00:10:56,521
that Mr. valmont has had
second thoughts about
our little transaction.

199
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:59,524
Your niece will find him
and fetch me the statue.

200
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:02,727
In exchange,
you get your freedom.

201
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:05,263
No! It is too dangerous!

202
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:08,333
I'll give you, say, an hour
to complete the task--

203
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:11,603
that is, if you ever want
to see your uncle again.

204
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:16,675
Don't worry, Jackie.
I'll nab that tabby.

205
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:20,011
Please, Jade.
Be very careful of
the statue's claws.

206
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,148
Hey, I know my way
around a cat.

207
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,549
(Whistles)

208
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:32,190
You touch one hair
on Jackie's head,

209
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:34,659
you're gonna have to
answer to me!

210
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:38,296
(Chuckles) Spunky.

211
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:39,764
Lock him up.

212
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,671
Heh.

213
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,775
So, how long
have you gentlemen

214
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:53,144
been in the
restaurant business?

215
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,046
(Cell phone rings)

216
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,716
Oh. I have to take this.

217
00:11:57,718 --> 00:11:59,684
Nice chatting with you.

218
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:02,020
Uncle?

219
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:05,490
No. Irish sweepstakes.
You win a million bucks!

220
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:07,926
Please, uncle.
I need to know
about the--

221
00:12:07,928 --> 00:12:09,461
getting to that!

222
00:12:09,463 --> 00:12:13,164
Old Moroccan legend
of cat statue
speaks of a proverb--

223
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:16,134
"the antidote to
the cat curse lies within."

224
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:18,336
Lies within?

225
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:19,871
Lies within <i> whom,</i>
uncle?

226
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:23,308
No idea. Sounds
like fortune cookie
nonsense to me.

227
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,510
Naptime. Good-bye.

228
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:29,647
Why'd he bring us here?

229
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:32,350
Said it was
supposed to be a big score.

230
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:34,285
It's a crummy factory.

231
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:36,688
(Sniffs)

232
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:39,257
Tcha, with a vault.

233
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,793
I'm starting to like
the new valmont.

234
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:44,596
He's thinking bigger,
working new angles.

235
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:49,267
Sweet!

236
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:51,903
(Purrs)

237
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,073
Good girl, Ruby!
You found him.

238
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:57,275
Lassie's got nothing on you!

239
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:03,448
A cow factory?

240
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:10,255
Oh, big v,
that is so gross!

241
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:12,490
Yeah, and all
that cholesterol!

242
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:17,462
(Meowing)

243
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:19,397
Shh! They'll hear us!

244
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:20,799
What is it, girl?

245
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:22,100
(Slurps)

246
00:13:22,102 --> 00:13:23,568
Oh, that's nothing
to worry about.

247
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:26,037
Just a big old tub
of--cream! Duh!

248
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:29,674
That's the trail
you were following.

249
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:31,843
Whatever.
You still found valmont.

250
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:34,112
Be back in 2 shakes
of a tail.

251
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:43,655
(Slurps)

252
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:45,056
(Sniffs)

253
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:46,191
(Growls)

254
00:13:46,193 --> 00:13:48,226
We have us
a cat burglar.

255
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,731
Time to scat, cat!

256
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:56,701
(Hisses)

257
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:06,845
Whoa!

258
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:13,818
(Yowls)

259
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,454
Cats hate water.

260
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:17,722
(Meows)

261
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:19,991
Don't worry, Ruby.
I won't let you get--

262
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:21,793
hey, let me go!

263
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:23,328
(Yowling)

264
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,996
Hey! Cut it out!

265
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:27,599
Aah!
- Uhh!

266
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:35,974
(Rip)

267
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:38,676
Ow! You owe me for
a new pair of jeans!

268
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:45,650
Ok, you've got your statue.

269
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:48,920
Finally!
The cat of Khartoum!

270
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:50,822
Mine!

271
00:14:50,824 --> 00:14:54,659
Yes! And without
having to spend a
penny to acquire it!

272
00:14:54,661 --> 00:14:57,061
Oh! I was not,
of course, implying

273
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,230
that you're cheap,
Mr. zendo.

274
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:00,932
(Nervous laugh)

275
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:05,403
You'll find your uncle
in the supply closet
off the hall.

276
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:08,406
No hard feelings,
my impressive young friend.

277
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,343
Jade!

278
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:14,312
Told you
I'd find the statue.

279
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:16,514
I'm just glad
you are unharmed.

280
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:18,049
Why wouldn't I be?

281
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:21,586
Now, let's get
the plaster cat back
from that zendo creep!

282
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:25,990
You wait here, <i> please!</i>

283
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:29,260
I suspect zendo will not
surrender the cat easily.

284
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:35,400
Mmm! (Slurps) Mmm!

285
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:37,235
Got evaporated milk?

286
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:42,674
(Gasps) Those claws,
those teeth!

287
00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:45,977
Yes. The artistry
is marvelous.

288
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:48,112
(Gasps)

289
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:49,414
Zendo: Valmont!

290
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:52,283
Oh, dear.
Look at the time.

291
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:55,253
I must go do
that thing...
That I must go do.

292
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:57,789
(Snarling)
Oh!

293
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,891
How delightful
to see you!

294
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:02,760
Yes. I was
absolutely
beside myself

295
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:05,029
to hear of how
that awful
little scamp

296
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:08,633
stole the statue
before you and I
had a chance

297
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,568
to complete
our transaction.

298
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,136
Grrr!

299
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:14,639
But, of course,
you want your money.

300
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:16,474
20 large, as agreed.

301
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,309
Count it
if you like.

302
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:20,478
I just did.

303
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:24,816
Now, then, there is
one more thing I require--

304
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:27,585
my statue!

305
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,887
But I paid for it!

306
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,056
It's mine!

307
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:34,759
No! It belongs
to the museum!

308
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:37,462
And you belong to me, rat!

309
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:39,764
Jade: Think again,
katman-don't!

310
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:41,199
(Hisses)

311
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:42,700
Oh! Jade!

312
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:45,770
Hah!

313
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:48,840
You--you were
scratched by the statue!

314
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:50,341
They were old jeans,
anywho.

315
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,977
Oh, you mean
the turning-into-
a-cat thing?

316
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:54,645
I was wondering
about that.

317
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:56,614
(Valmont and Jade hiss)

318
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,019
Whoa. Cat fight.

319
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:02,954
Forget them! Get chan!

320
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:08,926
Aah!

321
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:12,196
No! (Gasps)

322
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:15,733
Babylonian urn!

323
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:17,435
What's a babylonian urn?

324
00:17:17,437 --> 00:17:19,470
Probably
more than we do!

325
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:24,976
Here, kitty kitty.

326
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:27,578
(Hissing)

327
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,280
(Jackie grunting)

328
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:36,120
Ow!
- Uhh!
- Ohh!

329
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,431
Uhh!
- Uhh!

330
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:48,933
When in tangiers,

331
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:50,268
beware of
flying carpets.

332
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,736
(Ruby meows)

333
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:54,072
(Gasps) Jade?

334
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,244
Wha--

335
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:01,446
(grunts)

336
00:18:01,448 --> 00:18:02,580
Uhh!

337
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:03,714
(Snarls)

338
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:04,949
Whoa! A mouse!

339
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:06,184
Mouse?

340
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,087
Uhh!

341
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:10,388
(Groans)

342
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:16,360
I think the words you're
looking for are, "me-ow."

343
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:19,997
Nobody messes with Jade,
queen of the jungle cats.

344
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:21,199
(Hisses)

345
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:23,434
Jade, you're not
a jungle cat.

346
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,870
I know that,
Jackie. <i> Hello!</i>

347
00:18:25,872 --> 00:18:27,538
And I know I've
got to change back,

348
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,273
so how do I do it?

349
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,075
Um...

350
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:32,844
What'd uncle say?

351
00:18:32,846 --> 00:18:36,581
He said,
"the antidote lies within."

352
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:39,050
Sounds like fortune
cookie talk to me.

353
00:18:39,052 --> 00:18:40,618
He said that, too.

354
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,288
Perhaps the statue itself
has some writing,

355
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:47,024
some clue as to
how to undo the curse.

356
00:18:47,026 --> 00:18:48,626
We must find zendo.

357
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,228
(Plant rustles)

358
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:53,698
(Nervous laugh)

359
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,266
Where's zendo?

360
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:57,435
I don't know.

361
00:18:57,437 --> 00:19:00,104
Truly I would tell you
if I did.

362
00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:01,772
Let me put it
another way--

363
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:03,841
(hisses)

364
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:16,287
Aah! Mr. chan!
Young lady!

365
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:19,724
I'm delighted to see
you're all right.

366
00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:21,993
I'm sure.
The statue.

367
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:25,730
Oh, yes, yes.
Of course.

368
00:19:25,732 --> 00:19:28,332
I always felt
it belonged
in a museum.

369
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:32,503
Here's chappy!

370
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,238
(Gasps)

371
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,073
(Both hiss and spit)

372
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:40,845
No. This is too
dangerous to be
in a museum.

373
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:45,016
Uhh!

374
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:46,984
Wha--uhh!

375
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:52,623
The antidote
lies within--

376
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,792
within the
statue itself!

377
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:55,927
Uhh!

378
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:58,095
Uhh!

379
00:19:58,097 --> 00:19:59,897
Ow! Please get off!

380
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,200
I bruise easily!

381
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:05,903
Well, that
was different.

382
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:08,472
The cat of Khartoum!
How could you?!

383
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:12,443
There's no use crying
over spilled milk.

384
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:24,589
Hey, Jackie!

385
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:26,457
What did you study
at Chinese opera?

386
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:29,894
Beginning, the teacher
really don't know
what I'm good for.

387
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:33,197
I train everything--
kicking, punch...
All kind of things.

388
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:36,467
Suddenly he find out
I have a very--
pretty good voice.

389
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:38,336
(Sings Italian opera)

390
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:43,841
After that, the opera
is not famous anymore.

391
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:45,309
Then I'm back
to training.

392
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:47,812
Almost whole day,
nonstop training

393
00:20:47,814 --> 00:20:50,314
until 11:00, 12:00.

394
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:52,850
When I take off my shoes,
ooh, stink.
