1
00:00:00,016 --> 00:00:01,440
Previously, on <i>"The Flash"...</i>

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:03,218
I can do some cool things,
you know.

3
00:00:03,219 --> 00:00:05,490
Sometimes I run so fast,
I reverse time a bit.

4
00:00:05,887 --> 00:00:07,806
Dark and Stormy on the house.

5
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:09,308
Do I look that pathetic?

6
00:00:09,377 --> 00:00:11,110
You look like you belong here
about as much as I do.

7
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:12,678
- Cisco.
- Kamilla.

8
00:00:12,747 --> 00:00:15,247
We may have found a way
to suppress the meta genome.

9
00:00:15,316 --> 00:00:17,783
Great, then we can use it
to de-power Cicada,

10
00:00:17,852 --> 00:00:19,818
- stop him for good.
- Who the hell are you?

11
00:00:19,887 --> 00:00:20,819
I'm a reporter.

12
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:25,224
We're gonna beat you.

13
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:37,436
Damn, you're good,

14
00:00:37,505 --> 00:00:39,371
real good.

15
00:00:46,447 --> 00:00:48,814
Maybe too good.

16
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:08,267
We did it.

17
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:09,902
We did it!

18
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,404
Oh, my.

19
00:01:12,473 --> 00:01:15,441
Cisco Ramon,
tonight you've got yourself

20
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:18,410
a hot date and a meta-human cure.

21
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,946
We're unstoppable.

22
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:29,303
Ooh, shrap...

23
00:01:29,978 --> 00:01:32,380
<font color="#00FFFF">Synced & corrected by</font> <font color="#D81D1D">MaxPayne</font>
== <font color="#138CE9">https://</font>subscene<font color="#138CE9">.com</font> ==

24
00:01:34,572 --> 00:01:36,328
We have to wait how long

25
00:01:36,397 --> 00:01:38,197
before we can use
the meta-human cure?

26
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:39,932
Not even that long.

27
00:01:40,034 --> 00:01:42,634
- Cisco.
- It's gonna go by like that.

28
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:46,271
Cisco.

29
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,307
- 29 days.
- A month?

30
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:53,779
- I know, right?
- Just one, teeny, tiny, month

31
00:01:53,848 --> 00:01:55,814
until we stop Cicada's purge.
You know,

32
00:01:55,883 --> 00:01:57,316
historically speaking,
this is way faster

33
00:01:57,384 --> 00:01:58,917
than we've ever
stopped a big bad so...

34
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:01,353
- We can't wait that long.
- If he finds another meta

35
00:02:01,422 --> 00:02:04,323
or comes after us... we have
to speed this up somehow.

36
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:05,924
We have to wait for the
compound to fully synthesize

37
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:07,626
or it won't be able to
effectively neutralize

38
00:02:07,695 --> 00:02:09,328
the dark matter in
a meta-human's pituitary gland.

39
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:12,564
Without any way to expedite
the exotic evolution...

40
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:13,765
Barry, we're gonna have to wait.

41
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:14,967
I think we have to wait.

42
00:02:15,035 --> 00:02:16,969
Unless...

43
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:20,839
you took it into
the Speed Force.

44
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:22,875
- Hmm?
- What, you want him to go into

45
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:24,810
the Speed Force for a month
and then, what,

46
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,445
come out the same
day that he left?

47
00:02:26,514 --> 00:02:30,816
Oh, no, no, I'm not saying
you manipulate time.

48
00:02:30,885 --> 00:02:33,018
I'm saying you manipulate
dark matter.

49
00:02:33,087 --> 00:02:35,320
So very simple.
It's simple chemistry, right?

50
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:38,257
When you are synthesizing
a compound, you use a...

51
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,459
Commodity, uh, substrate, uh...

52
00:02:40,528 --> 00:02:42,728
- A catalyst?
- Catalyst, right.

53
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:45,764
And the most efficient catalyst
you can use when synthesizing

54
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,533
a compound that negates
dark matter

55
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:49,568
is superluminal particles.

56
00:02:49,637 --> 00:02:51,570
- Tachyons?
<i>- Très bien.</i>

57
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:54,740
Tachyons, and the place where
tachyons are the most dense?

58
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:57,409
- Speed Force.
- And voilà.

59
00:02:57,478 --> 00:02:58,777
That might actually work.

60
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:01,246
- Yeah, it will.
- It'll be like nuking it

61
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:03,549
in a pan-dimensional microwave.

62
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:05,217
- Nice work.
- I know.

63
00:03:05,286 --> 00:03:06,952
So how much time
would this save?

64
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:11,456
From 29 days down to 60 minutes.

65
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:12,891
Yeah, it's gonna be faster.

66
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,527
And also since Cicada
has been quiet

67
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:17,296
since your last encounter,

68
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:19,598
maybe there's no time
like the present.

69
00:03:22,303 --> 00:03:24,336
- Do it.
- All right.

70
00:03:24,405 --> 00:03:25,704
I'll see you in an hour.

71
00:03:33,781 --> 00:03:35,581
Nora, you need to stay here.

72
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:36,782
You don't want my help?

73
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,550
- I just...
- I got this one this time.

74
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:40,986
Are you sure that now
is a good time to go?

75
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:44,389
I mean, I just mean,
the city will be Flash-less,

76
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:48,560
and an hour is a long time
to be without the Flash.

77
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:51,897
The city is not gonna be
Flash-less. It'll have XS.

78
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:54,299
Yeah, but what about the time
you had to spend 24 hours

79
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:56,935
in the Pipeline cell and
Weather Witch and Silver Ghost

80
00:03:57,004 --> 00:03:59,238
- stole that A.R.G.U.S. car...
- And you stopped them

81
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:00,872
without me.

82
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:04,142
Eh, with what happened to Mom
because of Cicada...

83
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:08,780
Iris, it's fine, and this
is the key to stopping Cicada.

84
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,719
I gotta go.
If anything happens,

85
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:15,020
just do what
I've trained you to do:

86
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:16,755
Slow down and think clearly.

87
00:04:16,824 --> 00:04:18,624
- Yeah.
- I trust you,

88
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:20,459
you just gotta trust yourself.

89
00:04:25,299 --> 00:04:28,400
You'll be fine.

90
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:34,373
60 minutes.

91
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:43,382
Nora, Cisco hasn't left
for his date yet, has he?

92
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,783
Uh, I don't think so.

93
00:04:44,852 --> 00:04:47,953
Great, we get another
chance at this.

94
00:04:52,393 --> 00:04:55,394
Well, it is... that's why
you don't do it.

95
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:59,898
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

96
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:06,004
- Oh, God.
- Not the "Book of Ralph" again!

97
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:07,939
- Yeah, buddy.
- You successfully completed

98
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:10,309
my 27 steps to getting over
the love of your life.

99
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:12,978
Gypsy is in the past.
You have a new siren,

100
00:05:13,047 --> 00:05:16,481
so now it's time for...

101
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,616
"The Art of Love."

102
00:05:17,685 --> 00:05:18,650
Um, Caitlin?

103
00:05:20,421 --> 00:05:22,854
I've gotta finish working on
the device to inject the cure.

104
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:26,925
Also I have to inject
the device for the cure.

105
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:28,260
I... I... I... Iris?

106
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:30,362
Oh, no, this is all you, man.

107
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:31,697
I got an article I gotta write.

108
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:33,432
Let me know when Barry
gets back.

109
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:40,405
Help Me.

110
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:42,941
"Chapter one: Initial Planning."

111
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:46,411
Initial planning?
It's a first date, Sun Tzu,

112
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,246
- not an incursion.
- Trust me, Grasshopper,

113
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:51,550
love is war, but, fine,
if you wanna skip

114
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:54,052
to chapter six,
"Know Your Terrain."

115
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:57,622
- We're meeting at Jitters.
- Ah, familiar territory.

116
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:58,990
You are learning.

117
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:01,426
Uh, you know,
he really should be going.

118
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:03,261
- I really should.
- Hang on, hang on one second.

119
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:06,431
This one's really important.
Chapter thirteen,

120
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,134
"Intelligence and Reconnaissance."

121
00:06:12,473 --> 00:06:14,840
- Wh...
- You cyber-stalked Kamilla?

122
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:16,775
No, no, no, no, of course not.

123
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:18,543
That's her public profile.

124
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:19,911
But it did happen to have
some info

125
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,446
on the types of guys
that she might be into.

126
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:23,648
The types of guys
that she's into?

127
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:28,153
Yes, and, unfortunately,
you are nothing like them,

128
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:30,689
but, hey, if you don't wanna
get a second date, be my guest.

129
00:06:30,758 --> 00:06:33,425
Just don't come crying to me
when everything inevitably

130
00:06:33,494 --> 00:06:36,128
goes horribly, horribly wrong
and you die alone.

131
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:37,529
No big deal.

132
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:47,773
See, now he's in my head.
Okay, no thank you.

133
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,320
I didn't take these.

134
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:05,090
- You saw nothing.
- Nothing.

135
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:56,475
One Cicada on the bar for Ian?

136
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:59,478
- It's I-an.
- Sorry, I-an.

137
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,887
Hey, Kamilla.

138
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:10,555
- Cisco.
- Wow.

139
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:13,325
- Sorry I'm late.
- I got held up at a meeting.

140
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:17,462
- That's okay.
- I just got here.

141
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:19,197
If I'd had known,
I would have dressed up more.

142
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:21,132
Oh, this old thing?

143
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:24,236
No, please,
this is work clothes.

144
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:27,205
You have to wear a suit
to your lab?

145
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:28,340
My lab?

146
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:29,741
When we met at the bar,

147
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,376
you were talking about
DNA and genomes,

148
00:08:31,445 --> 00:08:33,578
so I assumed you were
some kind of scientist.

149
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:36,848
Right, I said that, scientist.

150
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:40,352
Yes. No. Well,
I'm what you would call

151
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:44,389
a science businessman.

152
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:49,194
So, what, you make money off
of other people's discoveries?

153
00:08:49,263 --> 00:08:55,367
Well, somebody has to.

154
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:58,770
It's just a little joke,
something I always say.

155
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:03,208
So, uh, what is the name
of the company you work for?

156
00:09:03,277 --> 00:09:07,679
It's called Ramon Industries.

157
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:10,715
It's named after yourself?

158
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:13,351
That's humble.

159
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:20,992
Maybe I should grab us
a couple coffees.

160
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,627
Sure.

161
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:26,565
- Decaf Flash.
- Decaf Flash, right, okay.

162
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:39,844
You're not the only one
who does their research.

163
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:43,949
I know who you are,
Iris West-Allen.

164
00:09:45,886 --> 00:09:51,556
I know you work with the Flash
and the other heroes.

165
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:54,292
You said you were gonna beat me,

166
00:09:54,361 --> 00:10:00,265
but tonight, I'm gonna beat you,

167
00:10:00,334 --> 00:10:01,499
all of you.

168
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:14,012
One Zoom and one decaf Flash.

169
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:17,782
- That's the decaf.
- Men in this city...

170
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:22,287
Tell me about it.

171
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:25,657
- Uh, I'm sorry, it's work.
- I have to go.

172
00:10:25,726 --> 00:10:29,160
Uh, could we just have,
like, a do-over, please?

173
00:10:48,582 --> 00:10:49,948
It's Mom.

174
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:17,542
Get away from her.

175
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:19,377
She's not who you want.

176
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:23,081
No, she's not, but you are.

177
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:27,619
Then come and get us.

178
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:35,060
Ah!

179
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:36,728
Caitlin!

180
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:46,471
Told ya.

181
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:27,112
Nora, Cisco hasn't left
for his date yet, has he?

182
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,681
Uh, I don't think so.

183
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,417
Great, I get another chance
at this.

184
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,459
We do.

185
00:12:50,315 --> 00:12:52,148
What's wrong?

186
00:12:53,885 --> 00:12:56,619
- Nora?
- Nothing.

187
00:12:56,688 --> 00:12:59,522
Come on,
you can figure this out.

188
00:12:59,591 --> 00:13:01,858
Not the "Book of Ralph" again!

189
00:13:01,927 --> 00:13:04,928
Yeah, buddy, you successfully
completed my 27 steps

190
00:13:04,996 --> 00:13:06,462
to getting over
the love of your life.

191
00:13:06,531 --> 00:13:08,831
Gypsy is in the past.
You have a new siren,

192
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,267
so now it's time for
"The Art of Love."

193
00:13:11,336 --> 00:13:12,835
Um, Caitlin?

194
00:13:12,904 --> 00:13:15,071
I gotta go work on the device
to inject the cure.

195
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:18,074
Also I have to devise the cure.

196
00:13:18,143 --> 00:13:19,275
I... I... I... Iris?

197
00:13:19,344 --> 00:13:21,277
Ooh, nah, that's all you, man.

198
00:13:21,346 --> 00:13:22,478
I gotta go write an article.

199
00:13:22,547 --> 00:13:23,680
Let me know
when Barry gets back.

200
00:13:23,748 --> 00:13:25,214
- Uh, no, you know what?
- Don't go.

201
00:13:25,283 --> 00:13:28,284
Uh, why don't you write
the article here?

202
00:13:28,353 --> 00:13:30,320
Uh, I can make you coffee.

203
00:13:30,388 --> 00:13:32,755
I mean, I know that there's
coffee over there, but I...

204
00:13:32,824 --> 00:13:34,524
I just think it's really
important for the team leader

205
00:13:34,592 --> 00:13:35,925
to stay here until Dad gets back

206
00:13:35,994 --> 00:13:38,328
just in case something
happens, okay?

207
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,500
Okay, lounge it is.

208
00:13:44,569 --> 00:13:47,637
All right, "chapter one:
Initial Planning."

209
00:13:47,706 --> 00:13:50,239
It's a first date, Sun Tzu,
not an incursion.

210
00:13:50,308 --> 00:13:52,542
Trust me, Grasshopper,
love is war.

211
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:55,244
Yeah, and I couldn't agree
more so read these.

212
00:13:55,313 --> 00:13:56,913
They'll help you,
and you'll know what to do.

213
00:13:56,982 --> 00:13:58,314
- Wait, wait, how...
- And if anything goes wrong,

214
00:13:58,383 --> 00:13:59,849
just give us a call.

215
00:13:59,918 --> 00:14:02,452
You and I are gonna stay here
and have our own coffees

216
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,520
in the lounge.
There's brownies.

217
00:14:04,589 --> 00:14:05,655
- Brownies?
- Yes.

218
00:14:05,724 --> 00:14:08,825
Ralph, did you cyber-stalk her?

219
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,800
You were talking about
DNA and genomes.

220
00:14:17,869 --> 00:14:19,402
I thought I'd finally met
a guy who was more concerned

221
00:14:19,471 --> 00:14:21,504
with flexing his brain
than his muscles.

222
00:14:26,745 --> 00:14:28,144
<i>Ca va?</i>

223
00:14:28,213 --> 00:14:31,447
- Yeah, yeah.
- Sorry, I just...

224
00:14:31,516 --> 00:14:34,684
I'm having the most
wicked déjà vu right now.

225
00:14:34,753 --> 00:14:35,918
Is that right?

226
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:16,192
Why don't you want your
mother to come here, hmm?

227
00:15:29,307 --> 00:15:31,841
Because you time-travel.

228
00:15:39,951 --> 00:15:42,685
- It's I-an.
- Sorry, I-an.

229
00:15:47,092 --> 00:15:49,659
Kamilla tha thrilla.

230
00:15:49,727 --> 00:15:51,828
Cisco?

231
00:15:51,896 --> 00:15:54,163
- Wow.
- Sorry I'm late.

232
00:15:54,232 --> 00:15:55,765
I just came from a photoshoot.

233
00:15:55,834 --> 00:15:58,701
The things you do
for the 'gram, am I right?

234
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:01,237
Hey, maybe next time you should
be my photographer.

235
00:16:01,306 --> 00:16:02,538
What do you think?

236
00:16:02,607 --> 00:16:03,940
So you're a...

237
00:16:04,008 --> 00:16:06,776
I'm an aspiring
social media influencer.

238
00:16:06,845 --> 00:16:08,544
This is my card.
You can keep that.

239
00:16:14,319 --> 00:16:15,618
When we met at the bar,

240
00:16:15,687 --> 00:16:17,620
you were talking about
DNA and genomes,

241
00:16:17,689 --> 00:16:21,557
so I assumed you were
some kind of scientist.

242
00:16:21,626 --> 00:16:24,293
Really?
When we met at the bar,

243
00:16:24,362 --> 00:16:27,130
you were talking about
DNA and genomes, so I...

244
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:30,633
You assumed
I was some kind of scientist?

245
00:16:30,702 --> 00:16:33,836
Yeah, exactly.

246
00:16:33,905 --> 00:16:35,238
Is everything okay?

247
00:16:35,306 --> 00:16:40,810
Yeah, I'm just having
some déjà vu again.

248
00:16:42,647 --> 00:16:44,847
Maybe I should grab us
a couple of coffees?

249
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:47,650
- Oh, yes.
- Yes, that'd be great.

250
00:16:47,719 --> 00:16:50,453
Will you get me a Zoom, please?

251
00:16:50,522 --> 00:16:52,255
Okay.

252
00:16:52,323 --> 00:16:54,423
What?

253
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:59,595
Okay, here we go.

254
00:16:59,664 --> 00:17:00,897
Thanks.

255
00:17:05,637 --> 00:17:08,237
- One Zoom and one decaf Flash.
- Thank you.

256
00:17:12,143 --> 00:17:15,044
Something's wrong,

257
00:17:15,113 --> 00:17:18,047
- and I think I have to go.
- Right now?

258
00:17:18,116 --> 00:17:20,950
No, right now.

259
00:17:22,287 --> 00:17:26,956
Yep, gotta go.
Um, I'd ask if we could have

260
00:17:27,025 --> 00:17:31,694
a do-over, but, um, something
tells me I already have.

261
00:17:35,466 --> 00:17:39,035
- The men in this city.
- Tell me about it.

262
00:17:46,844 --> 00:17:48,744
- Come on!
- It's Sherloque.

263
00:17:48,813 --> 00:17:50,513
What? I thought he was here
with Caitlin.

264
00:17:50,582 --> 00:17:53,082
- We gotta get Frost.
- No, no, I got this.

265
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:55,818
You guys just stay here.

266
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:14,904
- Garçon, look out!
- Ah!

267
00:18:23,481 --> 00:18:26,582
Told ya.

268
00:18:26,651 --> 00:18:29,752
Cisco!

269
00:18:29,821 --> 00:18:32,855
Why can't I fix this?

270
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:47,403
Ugh! Why can't
I go back any further?

271
00:18:47,472 --> 00:18:50,106
- Nora?
- Cisco hasn't left yet.

272
00:18:50,174 --> 00:18:51,240
Great.

273
00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:53,109
So we get another
chance at this.

274
00:18:53,177 --> 00:18:54,543
We do.

275
00:19:06,548 --> 00:19:07,881
I'm fine, Sherloque.

276
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,816
I have to fix this.

277
00:19:20,729 --> 00:19:23,063
Okay,
you guys have to stay here.

278
00:19:23,131 --> 00:19:24,731
- Why?
- Because Dad put his trust

279
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,366
in me that I would protect
all of you

280
00:19:26,435 --> 00:19:28,134
and I'm the only speedster here
for the first time

281
00:19:28,203 --> 00:19:30,003
and if something were to go
wrong, I don't know

282
00:19:30,072 --> 00:19:31,838
if I could fix it, in fact,
I'm pretty sure that I couldn't

283
00:19:31,907 --> 00:19:35,709
fix it, so just,
for one hour, stay here.

284
00:19:37,212 --> 00:19:40,814
I have to go finish...

285
00:19:40,882 --> 00:19:43,817
- No, no!
- I got a date with...

286
00:19:46,755 --> 00:19:49,256
Were you cyber-stalking Kamilla?

287
00:19:49,324 --> 00:19:50,690
No, no, no, of course not.

288
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:52,292
This is her public profile.

289
00:19:52,361 --> 00:19:53,760
You were talking
about DNA and genomes,

290
00:19:53,829 --> 00:19:55,462
so I thought I'd finally met a guy

291
00:19:55,530 --> 00:20:00,333
who is more concerned with
his brain than his muscles.

292
00:20:00,402 --> 00:20:02,569
- Kamilla.
- Oh, I got some details on

293
00:20:02,638 --> 00:20:04,004
- the kinds of guys she's into.
- Mm-mm.

294
00:20:04,072 --> 00:20:06,206
Wait,
were you cyber-stalking her?

295
00:20:06,275 --> 00:20:09,009
- No, I'm not stalking her.
- It's her public profile.

296
00:20:09,077 --> 00:20:13,413
Guys! I'm sorry, but you're
just gonna have to stay here.

297
00:20:53,588 --> 00:20:55,121
- I-an.
- Sorry, I-an.

298
00:21:01,697 --> 00:21:03,897
You have got to be kidding me.

299
00:21:05,367 --> 00:21:06,800
You got the first one.

300
00:21:06,868 --> 00:21:08,935
- I got the next one.
- I think we all got one.

301
00:21:09,004 --> 00:21:10,537
What did you get?

302
00:21:17,412 --> 00:21:20,747
- It's Cecile.
- Guys, um, just stay here.

303
00:21:31,626 --> 00:21:33,226
Told ya.

304
00:21:59,755 --> 00:22:01,020
Nora?

305
00:22:01,089 --> 00:22:02,522
I was supposed to protect you,

306
00:22:02,591 --> 00:22:04,791
but I can't.
I don't know how to.

307
00:22:06,995 --> 00:22:09,262
But my dad does.

308
00:22:20,909 --> 00:22:25,879
I can't get into
the Speed Force either?

309
00:22:35,457 --> 00:22:37,223
You're reversing time,
aren't you?

310
00:22:42,197 --> 00:22:44,864
And I can't fix it.

311
00:22:47,984 --> 00:22:52,496
- So all of us die?
- Sometimes,

312
00:22:52,565 --> 00:22:55,066
or just one of you.

313
00:22:55,134 --> 00:23:00,471
Sometimes Cecile, but every
time, there's at least one.

314
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:03,541
I thought I was having déjà vu.

315
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:07,345
I keep seeing my date
with Kamilla again and again,

316
00:23:07,413 --> 00:23:12,717
me failing miserably
every time by using these.

317
00:23:12,785 --> 00:23:15,853
I'm not having déjà vu.

318
00:23:15,922 --> 00:23:18,923
I'm vibing the past hour
over and over.

319
00:23:18,992 --> 00:23:20,091
Yeah.

320
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,326
How many times
has this happened?

321
00:23:22,395 --> 00:23:25,162
- 52.
- 52?

322
00:23:25,231 --> 00:23:26,530
This is one
of those fixed points

323
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:28,566
the Legends theorized, isn't it?

324
00:23:28,635 --> 00:23:30,601
There's no way to
keep one of us from dying.

325
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:33,471
- We have to get Barry.
- No, I tried that,

326
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:34,705
but there's something
wrong with me.

327
00:23:34,774 --> 00:23:36,274
I can't get into
the Speed Force.

328
00:23:36,342 --> 00:23:38,342
Well, then we'll just wait
here until he gets back.

329
00:23:38,411 --> 00:23:41,679
No, if we do that,
Cicada will kill Cecile.

330
00:23:41,748 --> 00:23:43,447
So just reverse time
and go back to before he left.

331
00:23:43,516 --> 00:23:46,684
No, I've tried that too,
but I can't control it.

332
00:23:46,753 --> 00:23:51,355
It doesn't matter what I try
to do. Nothing works!

333
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:04,769
Believe it or not,
this ain't the first time

334
00:24:04,837 --> 00:24:07,838
I've died in a past timeline.

335
00:24:07,907 --> 00:24:13,511
Ah, I once got a vibrating hand
through the chest

336
00:24:13,579 --> 00:24:17,114
courtesy of Eobard Thawne.

337
00:24:17,183 --> 00:24:18,950
Well, more than once.

338
00:24:19,018 --> 00:24:22,687
I actually kept vibing
that moment until I realized

339
00:24:22,755 --> 00:24:26,624
that it actually happened.

340
00:24:26,693 --> 00:24:28,192
I guess I should have known
the same thing

341
00:24:28,261 --> 00:24:29,627
was happening now, huh?

342
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:39,003
I keep trying my absolute
hardest to change the outcome,

343
00:24:39,072 --> 00:24:42,807
but I end up failing every time.

344
00:24:42,875 --> 00:24:44,976
What if we can't fix this,
Cisco?

345
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:51,415
Nora, sometimes we fail because

346
00:24:51,484 --> 00:24:55,052
all we worry about is not failing.

347
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:00,624
I'm so worried about
my first date since Cynthia

348
00:25:00,693 --> 00:25:03,828
that I don't feel free to be
myself around Kamilla,

349
00:25:03,896 --> 00:25:07,264
and then I'll just end up
screwing it up even more.

350
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:10,701
This... this intelligence
and reconnaissance mess,

351
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:15,039
I don't need this.
All I need is to be myself.

352
00:25:15,108 --> 00:25:17,241
Duh! And I sure as hell

353
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:20,578
don't need to dress up like Ozone

354
00:25:20,646 --> 00:25:22,580
just to impress Kamilla.

355
00:25:22,648 --> 00:25:25,016
Sorry, that is
an outdated reference.

356
00:25:25,084 --> 00:25:26,917
No, from the movie
"Breakin'."

357
00:25:26,986 --> 00:25:29,653
Yeah, I've seen
"Electric Boogaloo" too.

358
00:25:29,722 --> 00:25:31,088
I've seen them both,
like, a hundred times.

359
00:25:31,157 --> 00:25:32,390
I know every move.

360
00:25:32,458 --> 00:25:34,759
Wow, fangirl.

361
00:25:39,866 --> 00:25:41,132
Wait.

362
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,566
Wait, that's it.

363
00:25:42,635 --> 00:25:46,570
Every time I fail,
I take notes in my journal

364
00:25:46,639 --> 00:25:48,406
so I can do something
different the next time.

365
00:25:48,474 --> 00:25:51,175
We know every move.

366
00:25:51,244 --> 00:25:54,211
So all you need to do
is just tell us

367
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,380
everything you've done
and how it went wrong.

368
00:25:56,449 --> 00:26:00,718
So we can figure out
how to make it right.

369
00:26:00,787 --> 00:26:03,487
52 kidnappings, 52 combinations

370
00:26:03,556 --> 00:26:04,955
leading to 52 deaths.

371
00:26:05,024 --> 00:26:08,059
- None of them were Cicada's?
- Exactly.

372
00:26:08,127 --> 00:26:09,660
Yes, exactly.

373
00:26:09,729 --> 00:26:12,663
Wait, does that mean you want
to use Cicada's dagger

374
00:26:12,732 --> 00:26:15,099
against him by having Nora
reverse time?

375
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,634
That's exactly
what I'm suggesting.

376
00:26:16,702 --> 00:26:18,369
Yeah, but how are we
gonna do that?

377
00:26:18,438 --> 00:26:20,438
I mean, Nora can't control it
when she reverses time.

378
00:26:20,506 --> 00:26:22,273
She could control her abilities

379
00:26:22,341 --> 00:26:25,843
if we help her slow down.

380
00:26:25,912 --> 00:26:27,445
Slowing it down.

381
00:26:27,513 --> 00:26:30,281
If she can do that,
we bring the fight to him.

382
00:26:30,349 --> 00:26:33,284
And we all live
through the night.

383
00:26:33,352 --> 00:26:34,618
I like the sound of that.

384
00:26:34,687 --> 00:26:38,422
Well, we have
everything we need.

385
00:27:16,395 --> 00:27:21,799
- Looking for me?
- I know you did your research.

386
00:27:21,868 --> 00:27:26,337
You know who I am,
that I work for the Flash

387
00:27:26,405 --> 00:27:28,472
and the other heroes.

388
00:27:30,843 --> 00:27:32,776
I told you
we were gonna beat you,

389
00:27:32,845 --> 00:27:34,211
and tonight we will...

390
00:27:36,849 --> 00:27:41,152
All of us.

391
00:27:49,996 --> 00:27:51,529
<i>Allez,</i> now!

392
00:28:53,192 --> 00:28:55,392
Ah!

393
00:29:07,306 --> 00:29:09,306
Ah!

394
00:29:11,677 --> 00:29:13,744
Told you.

395
00:29:23,953 --> 00:29:28,122
No Dark matter anywhere.
Dwyer's gone, again.

396
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,957
Maybe after the ass kicking
he just got,

397
00:29:30,025 --> 00:29:31,992
he'll think twice
before coming after us again.

398
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:35,062
And if he doesn't think
twice, now you can make him.

399
00:29:36,499 --> 00:29:38,499
Thanks for helping me
slow it down.

400
00:29:38,567 --> 00:29:41,101
Now that I've experienced
a sense of control,

401
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:43,804
maybe next time,
I can do it on my own.

402
00:29:43,873 --> 00:29:47,474
Thank you for saving us,
all of us.

403
00:29:47,543 --> 00:29:50,144
I didn't save everything.

404
00:29:50,212 --> 00:29:52,146
Maybe you can now?

405
00:29:52,214 --> 00:29:54,414
No, no, that date is over.

406
00:29:54,483 --> 00:29:56,383
There's no way Kamilla's
still at Jitters.

407
00:29:56,452 --> 00:29:59,353
Well, if she is still there,
there might be some stuff

408
00:29:59,421 --> 00:30:02,189
in here that can help you
smooth things over.

409
00:30:04,527 --> 00:30:08,328
But, you can handle it.
You're Cisco Ramon.

410
00:30:08,397 --> 00:30:11,365
Come on,
you gotta get a move on.

411
00:30:11,433 --> 00:30:13,233
Okay.

412
00:30:13,302 --> 00:30:15,102
- Giddyap, Romeo.
- I'm moving.

413
00:30:15,171 --> 00:30:16,870
Okay.

414
00:30:20,676 --> 00:30:25,579
- Sherloque was right.
- One hour, it's cooked.

415
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:29,983
Something happen
while I was gone?

416
00:30:34,456 --> 00:30:36,790
Kid Flash on the bar for Steven?

417
00:30:36,859 --> 00:30:39,393
- It's Stephan.
- Sorry, Stephan.

418
00:30:42,998 --> 00:30:48,535
- Kamilla, hey.
- Cisco, wow.

419
00:30:48,604 --> 00:30:54,608
- I am so sorry I'm late.
- I had an emergency at work.

420
00:30:54,677 --> 00:31:00,380
It's okay, I just got here.

421
00:31:00,449 --> 00:31:02,683
So you're a scientist, right?

422
00:31:02,751 --> 00:31:04,151
When we were at the bar,

423
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:08,121
you were talking about
DNA and genomes, so...

424
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:10,257
Well...

425
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:14,528
I'm more of a tech nerd,
actually, but the project

426
00:31:14,597 --> 00:31:18,632
that we're working on now,
it gets very scientific.

427
00:31:18,701 --> 00:31:20,334
You sound like
you're really excited about it.

428
00:31:20,402 --> 00:31:23,003
- Oh, my God, I am.
- I'm so excited about it.

429
00:31:23,072 --> 00:31:24,504
You have no idea, um.

430
00:31:24,573 --> 00:31:29,409
I think we might have made
a breakthrough recently,

431
00:31:29,478 --> 00:31:32,012
a breakthrough that could
change a lot of lives.

432
00:31:36,652 --> 00:31:38,952
One Zoom and one decaf Flash.

433
00:31:39,021 --> 00:31:41,922
I hope you don't mind,
I called it in ahead of time.

434
00:31:41,991 --> 00:31:43,523
It's the least I could do.

435
00:31:43,592 --> 00:31:48,095
- That's the decaf.
- How did you know what I like?

436
00:31:48,163 --> 00:31:49,930
I had a feeling.

437
00:31:49,999 --> 00:31:51,999
Not like most of the men
in this city.

438
00:31:52,067 --> 00:31:55,135
Tell me about it.

439
00:31:55,204 --> 00:32:00,807
Listen, I know I screwed up
royally showing up late

440
00:32:00,876 --> 00:32:05,412
like this, but it would make me
very happy if...

441
00:32:07,583 --> 00:32:13,387
Can we just
have a do-over, please?

442
00:32:13,455 --> 00:32:15,222
That sounds nice.

443
00:32:18,627 --> 00:32:22,562
52 times?

444
00:32:22,631 --> 00:32:26,166
53, if you include now.

445
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:29,236
That's a lot.

446
00:32:29,305 --> 00:32:31,538
What was I supposed to do,
let one of them die?

447
00:32:35,144 --> 00:32:39,413
The thing is, Nora, there are
consequences to time travel.

448
00:32:39,481 --> 00:32:42,249
- Oh, I know.
- No, you don't,

449
00:32:42,318 --> 00:32:43,717
not like I do.

450
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:51,358
Let me show you something.

451
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:58,932
Imagine this coffee cup
is the space/time continuum.

452
00:32:59,001 --> 00:33:03,837
Whenever you go back in time,
it breaks.

453
00:33:05,574 --> 00:33:10,844
Now, you can try and reset
the timeline,

454
00:33:10,913 --> 00:33:15,816
try and fix it, but no matter
how hard you try,

455
00:33:15,884 --> 00:33:20,721
it's never
gonna be exactly how it was.

456
00:33:20,789 --> 00:33:23,457
It seems like things worked
out this time,

457
00:33:23,525 --> 00:33:25,325
but that's not
always gonna be true,

458
00:33:25,394 --> 00:33:29,262
and it's impossible to know how
these changes are gonna unfold,

459
00:33:29,331 --> 00:33:33,433
the ripples you'll cause,
whose life you're gonna affect.

460
00:33:33,502 --> 00:33:35,902
No one can do that.

461
00:33:35,971 --> 00:33:37,471
No one?

462
00:33:37,539 --> 00:33:38,538
No one.

463
00:33:40,075 --> 00:33:43,243
We're not gods, Nora.

464
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:45,812
We've just been given
extraordinary abilities.

465
00:34:28,757 --> 00:34:33,760
Thawne, I need to know we're
not making this worse.

466
00:34:33,829 --> 00:34:35,362
Tell me you know
what you're doing.

467
00:34:35,431 --> 00:34:38,465
I am the only speedster
who knows what he's doing!

468
00:34:43,505 --> 00:34:47,340
Stick with the plan.

469
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:51,178
Follow my instructions
and we'll defeat Cicada,

470
00:34:51,246 --> 00:34:53,547
we'll destroy his dagger,

471
00:34:53,615 --> 00:34:57,951
and then we will
save your father.
