1
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,241
I hear they might promote Bryukhanov.

2
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:40,578
This little problem we have
with the safety test,

3
00:02:41,412 --> 00:02:43,915
if it's completed successfully...

4
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,002
Yes, I think promotion's very likely.

5
00:02:49,045 --> 00:02:51,047
Who knows, maybe Moscow.

6
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:55,426
Naturally, they'll put me in charge
once he's gone,

7
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:58,263
and then I'll need someone
to take my old job.

8
00:03:00,223 --> 00:03:02,308
I could pick Sitnikov.

9
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,944
I would like to be considered.

10
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:17,866
We'll keep that in mind.

11
00:03:19,784 --> 00:03:23,913
Viktor Petrovich, preparations
for the test have gone smoothly.

12
00:03:23,997 --> 00:03:27,292
Comrade Dyatlov's been working
per my instructions,

13
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:30,837
and Reactor 4 output's been
reduced to 1,600 megawatts.

14
00:03:31,713 --> 00:03:35,008
With your approval, we're ready
to continue lowering power to...

15
00:03:35,091 --> 00:03:36,259
We have to wait.

16
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:38,928
Is, uh...

17
00:03:39,512 --> 00:03:41,973
Are you going to ask me
if there's a problem, Nikolai?

18
00:03:42,432 --> 00:03:44,267
You can't read a fucking face?

19
00:03:44,851 --> 00:03:47,228
Three years,
I've tried to finish this test.

20
00:03:47,312 --> 00:03:48,438
Three years.

21
00:03:55,904 --> 00:03:58,114
I've just had a call from
the grid controller in Kiev.

22
00:03:58,197 --> 00:04:00,366
He says we can't
lower power any further,

23
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:01,743
not for another 10 hours.

24
00:04:01,826 --> 00:04:03,661
A grid controller?
Where does he get off...

25
00:04:03,745 --> 00:04:06,372
It's not the grid controller's
decision, Dyatlov.

26
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,875
It's the end of the month.

27
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:12,420
All the productivity quotas.

28
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:15,214
Everyone's working overtime.
The factories need power.

29
00:04:15,298 --> 00:04:17,050
Someone's pushing down from above.

30
00:04:17,133 --> 00:04:18,676
Not that we'll never know who.

31
00:04:27,352 --> 00:04:29,604
So, do we have to scrap it or what?

32
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:31,481
No, I don't think so.

33
00:04:32,148 --> 00:04:34,734
If we need to wait 10 hours, we wait.

34
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:38,237
Running at half power, we're not
going to have stability issues?

35
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:40,949
- No, I should think...
- I'm not asking you.

36
00:04:44,077 --> 00:04:45,328
It's safe.

37
00:04:45,787 --> 00:04:47,205
We'll maintain at 1,600.

38
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:49,707
I'll go home, get some sleep,
come back tonight.

39
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,042
We'll proceed then.

40
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:54,003
I'll personally supervise the test.

41
00:04:54,754 --> 00:04:56,547
And it will be completed.

42
00:05:00,426 --> 00:05:01,886
Well, I'm not waiting around, then.

43
00:05:03,221 --> 00:05:04,555
Call me when it's done.

44
00:06:42,153 --> 00:06:43,237
How do you feel?

45
00:06:45,615 --> 00:06:48,201
You went to the doctor yesterday.
How is your health?

46
00:06:49,327 --> 00:06:50,411
You don't know?

47
00:06:52,622 --> 00:06:53,956
From Vienna.

48
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:55,666
Do you read German?

49
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:02,298
It says, "At last a Soviet
scientist who tells the truth."

50
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:04,967
Obviously, I resent the insinuation,

51
00:07:05,051 --> 00:07:06,177
but I think it's fair to say

52
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,554
you made an excellent impression
at the conference.

53
00:07:09,013 --> 00:07:11,057
Turns out, you're quite good at this.

54
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,518
At what? Lying?

55
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:16,562
Statecraft, Legasov. Statecraft.

56
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:19,232
The West is now satisfied

57
00:07:19,315 --> 00:07:22,151
that Chernobyl was solely
the result of operator error,

58
00:07:22,235 --> 00:07:23,653
which it essentially was.

59
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:26,155
We have you to thank for that,

60
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:27,698
and we intend to.

61
00:07:32,036 --> 00:07:34,080
"Hero of the Soviet Union."

62
00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:36,290
Our highest honor.

63
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:39,043
They haven't even given it to me.

64
00:07:39,627 --> 00:07:42,839
"Promotion to director
of the Kurchatov Institute."

65
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:47,593
I'm humbled.

66
00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:52,223
I don't think there's anything humble
about you, Valery Alexeyevich.

67
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:54,183
These rewards are not yours yet.

68
00:07:54,851 --> 00:07:56,644
First, your testimony at the trial.

69
00:07:56,727 --> 00:08:00,648
Comrade Charkov,
I understand my duty to the State.

70
00:08:01,941 --> 00:08:03,901
But you gave us assurances.

71
00:08:04,694 --> 00:08:07,155
The reactors would be made safe.

72
00:08:07,238 --> 00:08:09,699
It's been months.
No changes have been made.

73
00:08:09,782 --> 00:08:13,119
- No changes even discussed.
- First, the trial.

74
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,914
Once it's over,
we will have our villains,

75
00:08:16,998 --> 00:08:20,168
we will have our hero,
we will have our truth.

76
00:08:21,085 --> 00:08:24,130
After that,
we can deal with the reactors.

77
00:09:49,048 --> 00:09:50,424
Did you take a train?

78
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:53,010
Yes, I took a train.

79
00:09:53,928 --> 00:09:55,763
Now let's talk about Vienna.

80
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:58,474
I'm not here to scold you.

81
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:02,478
I know how the world works
despite what Shcherbina says.

82
00:10:03,813 --> 00:10:06,691
So, why are you here?

83
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,694
Because I'm brutally stubborn.

84
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:12,071
Which you were hoping for.

85
00:10:16,534 --> 00:10:20,288
Charkov is saying they're going to fix
the reactors after the trial.

86
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:24,458
Do you believe him?

87
00:10:27,003 --> 00:10:29,171
The State will never
willingly fix the reactors

88
00:10:29,255 --> 00:10:32,591
because acknowledging the problem
means admitting that they lied.

89
00:10:32,675 --> 00:10:34,385
They will have to be forced.

90
00:10:41,684 --> 00:10:44,812
At the trial,
you're going to tell the truth.

91
00:10:46,731 --> 00:10:48,858
You're going to convince the jury.

92
00:10:48,941 --> 00:10:50,609
It's a show trial.

93
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:53,279
The jury's already been
handed their verdict.

94
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:54,697
I'm not talking about them.

95
00:10:57,074 --> 00:11:00,953
The Central Committee have invited
members of the scientific community

96
00:11:01,037 --> 00:11:02,455
to observe the trial.

97
00:11:02,997 --> 00:11:05,875
Our colleagues, from Kurchatov,

98
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:08,377
from Sredmash, from Minenergo,

99
00:11:08,461 --> 00:11:12,048
they will be sitting in the crowd
listening to every word you say.

100
00:11:12,131 --> 00:11:14,342
A jury that only we know is there.

101
00:11:14,425 --> 00:11:17,928
And when your testimony arrives
at the moment of the explosion?

102
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:23,017
That is when our jury
will finally hear the truth.

103
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:26,729
- And do what with it?
- Insist on reform.

104
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:30,649
Not just to the RBMK,
but the entire industry.

105
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:31,734
No, no, no.

106
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:33,378
- They can't function without us.
- No, no, no.

107
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:34,403
If we...

108
00:11:34,487 --> 00:11:38,532
Do you know what happened to Volkov,
the man whose report you found?

109
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:42,995
They just removed him
from his position at the Institute.

110
00:11:43,913 --> 00:11:46,207
Sacked for the crime of knowing.

111
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:52,213
And you think that these scientists,
handpicked to witness a show trial,

112
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:55,508
will somehow be stirred
into action by me?

113
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,804
Because of some heroic stance
I take in defiance of the State?

114
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:01,138
Yes.

115
00:12:01,222 --> 00:12:02,264
Why?

116
00:12:02,348 --> 00:12:05,768
Because you're Valery Legasov,
and you mean something.

117
00:12:07,937 --> 00:12:10,606
I'd like to think that if I spoke out,
it would be enough.

118
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:13,734
But I know how the world works.

119
00:12:17,113 --> 00:12:19,782
They will shoot me, Khomyuk.

120
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:26,497
You told me to find out what happened.

121
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,707
I spoke to dozens of people.

122
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:32,002
Every word they said, I wrote down.

123
00:12:33,254 --> 00:12:34,588
All in these books.

124
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,508
These are the ones
who are still alive.

125
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:39,218
These are the ones who are dead.

126
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:40,928
They died rescuing each other.

127
00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:44,265
Putting out fires,
tending to the wounded.

128
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:46,100
They didn't hesitate.
They didn't waiver.

129
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:48,269
They simply did what had to be done.

130
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:49,353
So have I.

131
00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:51,647
So have I.

132
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,817
I went willingly to an open reactor.

133
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:58,154
So I've already given my life.

134
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:00,698
Isn't that enough?

135
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:04,994
No, I'm sorry, but it is not.

136
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,358
"The Central Committee of the
Communist Party of the Soviet Union

137
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:20,402
and the Presidium of the
Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R.

138
00:14:20,486 --> 00:14:23,781
has determined that justice
be carried out on behalf of the People

139

in accordance with the
general goal of our Party

as determined by its 20th,
21st and 22nd Congresses,

141
00:14:30,246 --> 00:14:32,164
which is a Leninist goal.

142
00:14:32,248 --> 00:14:36,210
It was, is, and will be the only
immutable goal in the Soviet state.

143
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:37,711
The path of Leninist principles

144
00:14:37,795 --> 00:14:40,464
shall be consistently
and undeviatingly followed,

145
00:14:40,548 --> 00:14:43,384
as it expresses the vital
interests of the Soviet people,

146
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:45,094
its hopes and aspirations

147
00:14:45,177 --> 00:14:47,346
as we guide the life of

of the Criminal Code
of the Soviet Union,

resulting in a nuclear disaster
on April 26, 1986.

The State calls witnesses

of the Byelorussian Nuclear Institute,

Deputy Chairman of
the Council of Ministers

162
00:15:28,721 --> 00:15:31,515
and head of the Bureau
for Fuel and Energy.

163
00:16:06,342 --> 00:16:10,554
It began with,
of all things, a safety test.

164
00:16:11,764 --> 00:16:14,516
Why was there need
for a safety test at all?

165
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:18,395
Reactor number 4 was not new
when the accident occurred.

166
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:23,817
In fact, it went into operation
on December 20th, 1983.

167
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:27,863
Eleven days later,
on the last day of the year,

168
00:16:28,781 --> 00:16:33,202
plant director Viktor Bryukhanov
signed this document,

169
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:39,625
certifying the completion
of the construction of the reactor.

170
00:16:41,627 --> 00:16:44,672
As a result of finishing the work
before the end of the year,

171
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:49,802
Comrade Bryukhanov was awarded
Hero of Socialist Labor.

172
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:54,264
Comrade Fomin was awarded
for Valorous Labor.

173
00:16:54,682 --> 00:16:58,727
Comrade Dyatlov was given
an Order of the Red Banner.

174
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:03,607
But their work was not finished.

175
00:17:05,317 --> 00:17:08,529
And this document was a lie.

176
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:12,491
In order to sign this certificate,

177
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:16,954
all safety tests had to have
been successfully completed,

178
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:18,831
and yet, one remained.

179
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:26,505
A nuclear reactor generates
heat in the core here.

180
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:29,717
A series of pumps, here and here,

181
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,845
send a constant flow of cooling water
through the core.

182
00:17:33,345 --> 00:17:35,848
The core's heat
turns the water to steam,

183
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:38,225
and the steam spins the turbine here,

184
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:39,935
and the result is electricity.

185
00:17:40,728 --> 00:17:43,564
But what if a power plant
has no power?

186
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:48,193
What if the power feeding
the plant itself is disrupted?

187
00:17:48,986 --> 00:17:53,365
A blackout, equipment failure,
or an attack by a foreign enemy?

188
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,326
If there's no power,

189
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,163
the pumps cannot move
water through the core.

190
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,999
And without water, the core overheats,

191
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:03,625
the fuel melts down.

192
00:18:03,709 --> 00:18:06,211
In short, a nuclear disaster.

193
00:18:06,295 --> 00:18:07,421
The solution?

194
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:11,341
Three diesel fuel
backup generators here.

195
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:13,719
So, problem solved?

196
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:15,471
No.

197
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:18,599
Bryukhanov knew that the problem
was not solved at all.

198
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:22,060
The backup generators took
approximately one minute

199
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:24,521
to reach the speed required

200
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:26,815
to power the pumps
and prevent a meltdown,

201
00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:29,902
and by that time,
it would be too late.

202
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,197
So we arrive at the safety test.

203
00:18:35,407 --> 00:18:36,784
The theory was this,

204
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:39,077
if the facility lost power,

205
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:41,038
the turbine, which had been spinning,

206
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:43,999
would take some time
to slow down and stop.

207
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:47,878
What if you could take the electricity
it was still generating

208
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:49,421
and transfer it to the pumps?

209
00:18:49,505 --> 00:18:53,342
What if the dying turbine could keep
the pumps working long enough

210
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:57,513
to bridge the 60-second gap
until the generators came on?

211
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:04,019
Any questions?

212
00:19:05,604 --> 00:19:08,816
No. Continue, please.

213
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:12,986
To test this theory,

214
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:17,491
the reactor is placed in a reduced
power mode, 700 megawatts,

215
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:19,326
to simulate a blackout condition.

216
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,329
Then the turbines are turned off,

217
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:24,373
and as they slowly spin down,

218
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:26,291
their electrical output is measured

219
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:29,336
to see if it's enough
to power the pumps.

220
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:31,505
The science is strong,

221
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:37,261
but a test is only as good
as the men carrying it out.

222
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:41,598
Now, the first time they tried,
they failed.

223
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:44,601
The second time they tried,
they failed.

224
00:19:45,102 --> 00:19:47,396
The third time they tried,
they failed.

225
00:19:48,105 --> 00:19:50,816
The fourth time they tried

226
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:54,528
was April 26th, 1986.

227
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:08,417
Comrade Khomyuk.

228
00:20:32,524 --> 00:20:34,276
To understand
what happened that night,

229
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:36,403
we have to go back 10 hours earlier,

230
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:39,865
April 25th, the day the test
was meant to take place.

231
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:43,410
By 2:00 in the afternoon,
the reactor has been lowered by half

232
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:46,622
from its normal output level
of 3,200 megawatts

233
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:48,957
to 1,600 megawatts and is stable

234
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:51,960
and ready to be reduced to its
final output level for the test,

235
00:20:52,044 --> 00:20:53,587
700 megawatts.

236
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:57,883
But before they can proceed,
there is a phone call.

237
00:20:59,301 --> 00:21:02,304
Power grid officials in Kiev
say that they cannot afford

238
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:05,682
a further reduction in the electricity
until after midnight.

239
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:08,101
They are asking for a 10-hour delay.

240
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:11,229
This is the first critical moment,

241
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:13,941
the first link
in the chain of disaster.

242
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:17,402
Competent management would have
insisted on canceling the test.

243
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:21,365
These three men allowed it to proceed.

244
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:25,202
Why was this delay so dangerous?

245
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:27,454
It created two problems.

246
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:30,290
One of them is scientific in nature,

247
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,669
and the other is very human.

248
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,755
This is the one
we will consider first.

249
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:41,760
<i>At midnight, there is a shift change.</i>

250
00:21:55,273 --> 00:21:56,274
Hey.

251
00:21:57,109 --> 00:21:59,695
- Khodemchuk...
- Forget it. Find another fool.

252
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:02,739
Toptunov, want to buy a motorcycle?

253
00:22:02,823 --> 00:22:05,200
Toptunov?
He's just a little boy.

254
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:07,203
He's got more hair on his face
than on his balls.

255
00:22:07,244 --> 00:22:09,496
Hair? Is that what's on his lip?

256
00:22:11,581 --> 00:22:12,666
Leonid Fedorovych.

257
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,877
Akimov says to come to the
control room as soon as you can.

258
00:22:15,961 --> 00:22:17,587
- Is he already here?
- He came in early.

259
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,381
Something about a test.

260
00:22:21,216 --> 00:22:23,427
You see? Desperate.

261
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:34,229
Sasha?

262
00:22:35,897 --> 00:22:38,275
You know the test
they were supposed to run?

263
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:41,987
The turbine rundown,
they tried it last year.

264
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:45,240
They couldn't do it on the day shift,
so they've given it to us.

265
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:46,491
To us?

266
00:22:46,575 --> 00:22:47,951
- We don't know what...
- Shh...

267
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,872
- We don't know what it is.
- It's fine.

268
00:22:51,955 --> 00:22:54,082
We take it down to 700, hold it there,

269
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:56,585
the rest is Stolyarchuk
and Kirschenbaum, but...

270
00:22:56,918 --> 00:22:59,254
Dyatlov is gonna be supervising.

271
00:22:59,963 --> 00:23:01,798
I have to do something
I've never done before

272
00:23:01,882 --> 00:23:03,276
with Dyatlov looking over my shoulder?

273
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:06,136
Yeah, well, don't worry,
we'll do it together.

274
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:07,819
I'm just looking
at the instructions now.

275
00:23:09,473 --> 00:23:11,349
Are we supposed to do those or not?

276
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:22,277
Yes, this is Akimov in 4.

277
00:23:23,445 --> 00:23:26,406
I have the manual
for the rundown test.

278
00:23:27,074 --> 00:23:28,867
You did it last year.

279
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:32,037
Yes, in the program,
there's instructions of what to do,

280
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,414
and then, well,
there's a lot of things crossed out.

281
00:23:34,498 --> 00:23:35,499
What should I...

282
00:23:37,626 --> 00:23:38,752
Well, what should I...

283
00:23:41,254 --> 00:23:42,297
Are you sure?

284
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:45,634
Right. Thank you.

285
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:49,554
He says to follow
the crossed-out instructions.

286
00:23:50,097 --> 00:23:51,681
So then why are they crossed out?

287
00:23:58,897 --> 00:24:00,398
We've been cleared to run the test.

288
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:02,984
1,600. Good.

289
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,488
Now, is it too much to ask that
you all know what you're doing?

290
00:24:06,571 --> 00:24:08,406
- Well...
- Yes. Absolutely.

291
00:24:09,991 --> 00:24:11,451
- Stolyarchuk?
- Yes.

292
00:24:11,535 --> 00:24:14,538
- Kirschenbaum?
- Uh, I haven't reviewed.

293
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:16,414
We only just found out really...

294
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:17,707
There, review it.

295
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:19,876
Or you can just do what I tell you.

296
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,587
I think even you, stupid as you are,
can manage that.

297
00:24:23,755 --> 00:24:24,756
Well, let's go.

298
00:24:28,718 --> 00:24:31,638
I'm supposed to switch the turbine off
while the reactor's still running?

299
00:24:31,721 --> 00:24:35,142
- This is not good...
- Shut the fuck up and do your job!

300
00:24:36,226 --> 00:24:39,646
Toptunov, reduce power to 700.

301
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:43,525
I've never done this with
the power so low before.

302
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:44,985
It's okay. I'm with you.

303
00:24:50,824 --> 00:24:52,367
Reducing power to 700.

304
00:24:53,994 --> 00:24:56,246
<i>I want you to think
of Yuri Gagarin.</i>

305
00:24:58,415 --> 00:25:01,042
I want you to imagine
that he has been told nothing

306
00:25:01,126 --> 00:25:02,377
of his mission into space

307
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,629
until the moment
that he is on the launch pad.

308
00:25:04,921 --> 00:25:06,965
I want you to imagine that all he has

309
00:25:07,048 --> 00:25:09,634
is a list of instructions
that he has never seen before,

310
00:25:09,718 --> 00:25:11,761
some of which have been crossed out.

311
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:16,016
This is exactly what was happening
in the control room of Reactor 4.

312
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:19,394
The night shift had not been trained
to perform the experiment.

313
00:25:19,477 --> 00:25:22,063
They hadn't even been
warned it was happening.

314
00:25:22,147 --> 00:25:24,065
Leonid Toptunov,

315
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:26,735
the operator
responsible for controlling

316
00:25:26,818 --> 00:25:29,279
and stabilizing the reactor
that night was

317
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:32,699
all of 25 years old.

318
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,036
And his total experience on the job?

319
00:25:37,287 --> 00:25:38,371
Four months.

320
00:25:40,248 --> 00:25:42,876
This is the human problem
created by the delay.

321
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:46,880
But inside the reactor core,

322
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:49,090
in the space
between the atoms themselves,

323
00:25:49,591 --> 00:25:52,260
something far more dangerous
is forming.

324
00:25:52,344 --> 00:25:53,762
A poison.

325
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:57,349
The time is 28 past midnight.

326
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,744
Comrade Legasov.

327
00:26:55,407 --> 00:26:57,826
I'm pleased to see some
of my colleagues here

328
00:26:57,909 --> 00:27:00,578
from the Kurchatov Institute
and Minenergo.

329
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:04,082
But you don't need to
be a nuclear scientist

330
00:27:04,165 --> 00:27:06,167
to understand what
happened at Chernobyl.

331
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:09,296
You only need to know this.

332
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:14,050
There are essentially two things
that happen inside a nuclear reactor.

333
00:27:14,718 --> 00:27:20,515
The reactivity, which generates power,
either goes up or it goes down.

334
00:27:21,182 --> 00:27:22,183
That's it.

335
00:27:22,851 --> 00:27:25,895
All the operators do
is maintain balance.

336
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:30,066
Uranium fuel.

337
00:27:32,694 --> 00:27:37,407
As uranium atoms split apart
and collide, reactivity goes up.

338
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:39,451
But if you don't balance
the reactivity,

339
00:27:39,534 --> 00:27:41,536
it never stops rising. So...

340
00:27:43,788 --> 00:27:46,207
Boron control rods.

341
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:50,962
They reduce reactivity
like brakes on a car.

342
00:27:52,464 --> 00:27:56,176
But there's a third factor
to consider, water.

343
00:27:57,844 --> 00:28:00,388
Cool water takes heat
out of the system.

344
00:28:00,472 --> 00:28:03,808
As it does, it turns to steam,
or what we call a "void."

345
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:07,312
In an RBMK reactor
of the type used at Chernobyl,

346
00:28:07,395 --> 00:28:11,232
there's something called
a "positive void coefficient."

347
00:28:11,316 --> 00:28:12,484
What does that mean?

348
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,697
It means that the more steam
present within the system,

349
00:28:17,781 --> 00:28:19,866
the higher the reactivity,

350
00:28:19,949 --> 00:28:22,869
which means more heat,
which means more steam,

351
00:28:22,952 --> 00:28:23,953
which means...

352
00:28:24,913 --> 00:28:28,291
It would appear we have
a vicious cycle on our hands.

353
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:31,419
And we would, were it not for this...

354
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:42,931
And we would, were it not for this,

355
00:28:43,014 --> 00:28:45,308
the negative temperature coefficient.

356
00:28:46,643 --> 00:28:52,315
When nuclear fuel gets hotter,
it gets less reactive,

357
00:28:53,608 --> 00:28:55,527
so fuel increases reactivity.

358
00:28:56,236 --> 00:28:59,114
Control rods and water reduce it.

359
00:28:59,197 --> 00:29:01,574
Steam increases it,

360
00:29:01,658 --> 00:29:04,119
and the rise in temperature
reduces it.

361
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:08,706
This is the invisible dance

362
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:12,460
that powers entire cities
without smoke or flame.

363
00:29:12,544 --> 00:29:14,879
And it is beautiful,

364
00:29:15,964 --> 00:29:17,465
when things are normal.

365
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:22,220
As uranium splits apart
to release energy,

366
00:29:22,303 --> 00:29:25,723
it breaks down
into a new element, xenon.

367
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:28,726
Xenon reduces reactivity.

368
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:31,354
This is the poison
Comrade Khomyuk mentioned.

369
00:29:32,313 --> 00:29:34,357
When the core
is running at full power,

370
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:37,318
it burns the xenon away
before it can cause a problem.

371
00:29:37,402 --> 00:29:39,612
But because of the delay,

372
00:29:39,696 --> 00:29:44,534
Chernobyl Reactor 4 has been held
at half power for 10 hours.

373
00:29:45,243 --> 00:29:47,495
The xenon did not burn away.

374
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:52,292
It built up, poisoning the core.

375
00:29:53,751 --> 00:29:55,503
We're starting to lose balance.

376
00:29:55,587 --> 00:29:59,382
At 28 minutes past midnight,

377
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:02,469
the reactor is now primed
to slow down.

378
00:30:03,303 --> 00:30:06,514
And yet, in less than an hour,
it will explode.

379
00:30:07,557 --> 00:30:10,643
If you can't understand
how a stalled nuclear reactor

380
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:13,438
could lead to an explosion,
I don't blame you.

381
00:30:13,521 --> 00:30:17,275
After all, you don't work in the
control room of a nuclear power plant.

382
00:30:18,193 --> 00:30:20,570
But as it turned out,

383
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:24,657
the men who did
didn't understand it either.

384
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,081
Easy now.

385
00:30:32,582 --> 00:30:33,708
Take it down.

386
00:30:34,626 --> 00:30:36,836
Good. Like that.

387
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,421
You should have finished by now.

388
00:30:38,505 --> 00:30:40,465
We're following protocol
for reduction rate.

389
00:30:40,548 --> 00:30:42,383
You're procrastinating.

390
00:30:42,467 --> 00:30:44,987
There are 10 other men in this plant
who would've done it already.

391
00:30:45,011 --> 00:30:47,347
Keep working. You're doing fine.

392
00:30:56,856 --> 00:31:00,235
Kirschenbaum, come get me
when these old women are ready.

393
00:31:00,318 --> 00:31:01,611
Yes, Comrade Dyatlov.

394
00:31:21,047 --> 00:31:25,468
Okay, very slow now.
Let's ease it down to 700.

395
00:31:28,805 --> 00:31:32,141
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow.
- I didn't move any rods there.

396
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:45,154
- What is this?
- I'm not even touching it.

397
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:11,306
We did everything right.

398
00:32:11,389 --> 00:32:12,825
I think that
maybe the core is poisoned.

399
00:32:12,849 --> 00:32:14,326
Well, if you thought
the core was poisoned,

400
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,954
then you didn't do everything right,
because you're choking my reactor!

401
00:32:16,978 --> 00:32:18,021
Get it back up!

402
00:32:18,104 --> 00:32:20,315
I think if we turn off LAC,

403
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:22,317
it may be possible
to get more control.

404
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,111
- Do it. Go.
- Switch off local automatic control.

405
00:32:25,194 --> 00:32:27,280
Go to global. Leonid.

406
00:32:28,156 --> 00:32:30,575
LAC disabled.
Global control activated.

407
00:32:36,748 --> 00:32:38,207
What did you do?

408
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:41,836
- I did what you said. I switched...
- Look at it!

409
00:32:43,212 --> 00:32:45,465
- I don't understand.
- Fucking amateurs.

410
00:32:45,548 --> 00:32:47,383
You've stalled the reactor.

411
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:49,302
How the fuck did
you get this job?

412
00:32:49,385 --> 00:32:50,470
Comrade Dyatlov...

413
00:32:50,553 --> 00:32:52,239
You're gonna tell me
you did everything right again,

414
00:32:52,263 --> 00:32:53,640
you incompetent asshole?

415
00:32:53,723 --> 00:32:56,434
I apologize for this
unsatisfactory result.

416
00:33:02,315 --> 00:33:03,399
What are you doing?

417
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:05,568
We have to shut all the way down.

418
00:33:05,652 --> 00:33:08,112
- No.
- We could be in a xenon pit.

419
00:33:08,196 --> 00:33:09,715
We have to shut down
and wait 24 hours.

420
00:33:09,739 --> 00:33:11,819
No. We're doing the test tonight.
Raise power to 700.

421
00:33:11,866 --> 00:33:13,242
We can't raise the
power from here.

422
00:33:13,326 --> 00:33:14,970
- The rules...
- Don't talk to me about rules.

423
00:33:14,994 --> 00:33:17,163
- If we fall from 80%...
- No, no. We fell from 50%.

424
00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:19,415
- 50% is even worse.
- The rules don't say 50.

425
00:33:19,499 --> 00:33:20,792
There is no rule!

426
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:24,754
Comrade Dyatlov, I apologize,
but what you're saying makes no sense.

427
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:26,756
- Raise the power.
- No.

428
00:33:28,132 --> 00:33:29,967
I won't do it. It isn't safe.

429
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:42,063
Safety first. Always.

430
00:33:42,939 --> 00:33:45,400
I've been saying that for 25 years.

431
00:33:45,483 --> 00:33:47,485
That's how long
I've done this job, 25 years.

432
00:33:47,568 --> 00:33:48,861
Is that longer than you, Akimov?

433
00:33:48,945 --> 00:33:50,029
Yes.

434
00:33:50,113 --> 00:33:52,323
- Is it much longer?
- Yes.

435
00:33:52,407 --> 00:33:54,951
And you with your mother's tit
barely out of your mouth?

436
00:33:57,537 --> 00:33:59,706
So if I say it's safe, it's safe.

437
00:33:59,789 --> 00:34:01,082
And if the two of you disagree,

438
00:34:01,165 --> 00:34:03,126
then you don't have to work here
and you won't.

439
00:34:03,209 --> 00:34:04,210
But not just here.

440
00:34:04,293 --> 00:34:07,755
You won't work at Kursk or Ignalina
or Leningrad or Novovoronezh.

441
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:10,883
You won't work anywhere ever again.
I'll see to it.

442
00:34:11,259 --> 00:34:13,678
I think you know I will see to it.

443
00:34:15,346 --> 00:34:16,597
Raise the power.

444
00:34:20,226 --> 00:34:21,936
I would like you
to record your command.

445
00:34:23,229 --> 00:34:24,313
Raise the power.

446
00:34:40,163 --> 00:34:41,372
Together, then.

447
00:34:45,168 --> 00:34:46,753
<i>I wasn't even there.</i>

448
00:34:47,545 --> 00:34:48,963
What?

449
00:34:51,007 --> 00:34:53,426
I wasn't in the room
when they raised the power.

450
00:34:54,177 --> 00:34:55,696
If you weren't there,
then where were you?

451
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:58,639
Comrade Legasov,
you are a witness, not a prosecutor.

452
00:34:58,723 --> 00:35:00,558
I will ask the questions here.

453
00:35:01,809 --> 00:35:03,853
If you weren't in the room,
then where were you?

454
00:35:06,564 --> 00:35:07,648
The toilet.

455
00:35:08,566 --> 00:35:10,902
The toilet?

456
00:35:12,695 --> 00:35:14,489
Comrade Khomyuk interviewed everyone

457
00:35:14,572 --> 00:35:16,049
who was in the control room
that night.

458
00:35:16,073 --> 00:35:17,867
They all told the same story.

459
00:35:21,454 --> 00:35:23,706
"I knew what Dyatlov
ordered was wrong,"

460
00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:26,501
"but if I didn't do what he said,
I would be fired."

461
00:35:27,084 --> 00:35:28,586
Leonid Toptunov.

462
00:35:30,254 --> 00:35:31,881
One day before he died.

463
00:35:32,924 --> 00:35:34,801
No, Comrade Dyatlov,
you were in the room.

464
00:35:35,176 --> 00:35:37,637
You ordered them to raise the power.
This is a fact.

465
00:35:47,897 --> 00:35:50,608
Court is now in recess.
Thirty minutes.

466
00:36:34,527 --> 00:36:37,363
Do you know anything
about this town, Chernobyl?

467
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:40,408
Not really, no.

468
00:36:41,784 --> 00:36:44,245
It was mostly Jews and Poles.

469
00:36:45,788 --> 00:36:49,458
The Jews were killed in pogroms,
and Stalin forced the Poles out.

470
00:36:50,293 --> 00:36:53,379
And then the Nazis came
and killed whoever was left.

471
00:36:54,463 --> 00:36:55,631
But after the war,

472
00:36:57,091 --> 00:36:59,051
people came to live here anyway.

473
00:37:00,428 --> 00:37:04,015
They knew the ground under
their feet was soaked in blood,

474
00:37:04,098 --> 00:37:05,308
but they didn't care.

475
00:37:07,018 --> 00:37:09,103
Dead Jews, dead Poles.

476
00:37:10,313 --> 00:37:11,355
But not them.

477
00:37:15,026 --> 00:37:17,194
No one ever thinks
it's going to happen to them.

478
00:37:19,363 --> 00:37:20,406
And here we are.

479
00:37:30,374 --> 00:37:31,375
How much time?

480
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:33,753
Maybe a year.

481
00:37:34,629 --> 00:37:37,423
They call it a...

482
00:37:37,506 --> 00:37:39,675
They call it a "long illness."

483
00:37:39,759 --> 00:37:41,469
It doesn't seem very long to me.

484
00:37:42,678 --> 00:37:44,764
I know you told me,
and I believed you.

485
00:37:46,265 --> 00:37:47,934
But time passed, and I thought

486
00:37:48,851 --> 00:37:50,519
it wouldn't happen to me.

487
00:37:51,646 --> 00:37:53,022
I wasted it.

488
00:37:53,731 --> 00:37:55,816
I wasted it all for nothing.

489
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:59,362
For nothing?

490
00:38:00,821 --> 00:38:03,616
Do you remember that morning
when I first called you,

491
00:38:03,699 --> 00:38:05,618
how unconcerned I was?

492
00:38:05,701 --> 00:38:07,638
I don't believe much that
comes out of the Kremlin,

493
00:38:07,662 --> 00:38:11,958
but when they told me they were
putting me in charge of the cleanup

494
00:38:12,917 --> 00:38:15,419
and they said it wasn't serious,
I believed them.

495
00:38:17,338 --> 00:38:18,422
You know why?

496
00:38:20,132 --> 00:38:21,884
Because they put you in charge.

497
00:38:22,843 --> 00:38:23,886
Yeah.

498
00:38:27,014 --> 00:38:29,392
I'm an inconsequential man, Valery.

499
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:31,852
That's all I've ever been.

500
00:38:33,187 --> 00:38:35,982
I hoped that one day
I would matter, but I didn't.

501
00:38:38,275 --> 00:38:41,195
I just stood next to people who did.

502
00:38:43,698 --> 00:38:46,117
There are other scientists like me.

503
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,577
Any one of them could
have done what I did.

504
00:38:48,661 --> 00:38:49,870
But you...

505
00:38:51,038 --> 00:38:54,792
Everything we asked for,
everything we needed.

506
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:59,630
Men, material, lunar rovers.

507
00:39:02,466 --> 00:39:04,385
Who else could have done these things?

508
00:39:06,721 --> 00:39:09,265
They heard me,
but they listened to you.

509
00:39:10,474 --> 00:39:14,103
Of all the ministers
and all the deputies,

510
00:39:14,186 --> 00:39:17,815
entire congregation of obedient fools,

511
00:39:18,774 --> 00:39:21,736
they mistakenly sent the one good man.

512
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,822
For God's sakes, Boris,

513
00:39:25,823 --> 00:39:28,242
you were the one who mattered most.

514
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:53,059
Ah, it's beautiful.

515
00:40:35,101 --> 00:40:36,936
Comrade Legasov.

516
00:40:49,532 --> 00:40:51,575
The time is 38 past midnight.

517
00:40:52,576 --> 00:40:54,411
The reactor is nearly shut down.

518
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:56,872
The operators of Reactor 4 are locked

519
00:40:56,956 --> 00:40:59,125
on a path that leads
directly to disaster.

520
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:01,335
There's no way to turn back.

521
00:41:01,752 --> 00:41:04,213
They do not yet know it,
but the die is cast.

522
00:41:05,047 --> 00:41:08,676
At 30 megawatts,
xenon is still being created,

523
00:41:08,759 --> 00:41:10,511
but none of it is burning away.

524
00:41:12,763 --> 00:41:14,682
The reactor is drowning in poison.

525
00:41:15,432 --> 00:41:19,103
To make matters worse,
the reactor isn't hot enough

526
00:41:19,186 --> 00:41:21,772
to produce sufficient steam.

527
00:41:23,732 --> 00:41:26,485
The only way to safely raise
power from this state

528
00:41:26,569 --> 00:41:30,906
is to do it very, very slowly
over the course of 24 hours.

529
00:41:31,699 --> 00:41:33,993
But Dyatlov wants it done now.

530
00:41:34,535 --> 00:41:37,997
Akimov and Toptunov have
only one course of action.

531
00:41:38,914 --> 00:41:41,250
They begin pulling control rods out.

532
00:41:41,917 --> 00:41:42,918
Dozens at a time.

533
00:41:43,419 --> 00:41:46,005
Halfway out,
three-quarters of the way out,

534
00:41:46,088 --> 00:41:48,883
still, the power does not budge.

535
00:41:48,966 --> 00:41:51,677
So they begin pulling
them all the way out.

536
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,556
There were 211 control rods
in Reactor 4.

537
00:41:55,639 --> 00:42:00,311
Akimov and Toptunov
completely withdrew 205.

538
00:42:00,394 --> 00:42:04,398
Remember, control rods
are the brakes on this car.

539
00:42:05,107 --> 00:42:11,614
Of 211 rods, only six
now remain in the reactor.

540
00:42:13,115 --> 00:42:15,910
As for the fuel, it's gone cold,

541
00:42:15,993 --> 00:42:17,995
so the negative
temperature coefficient

542
00:42:18,078 --> 00:42:20,664
is no longer
weighing down the reactivity.

543
00:42:20,748 --> 00:42:24,627
But even still,
the xenon poisoning is so strong,

544
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:28,297
the best they can do is raise
the power to 200 megawatts.

545
00:42:29,715 --> 00:42:31,508
The control rods are out.

546
00:42:31,967 --> 00:42:34,428
The emergency system
has been disconnected.

547
00:42:34,511 --> 00:42:36,680
The only thing keeping
the reactor in check

548
00:42:36,764 --> 00:42:39,350
is water and xenon.

549
00:42:39,433 --> 00:42:43,354
It's 1:00 in the morning.
The test is minutes away.

550
00:43:17,888 --> 00:43:20,015
I'm sorry, this is all we can get.

551
00:43:20,516 --> 00:43:22,935
It's 200 megawatts.
We've pulled almost everything out.

552
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:25,159
If that's all we have,
that's all we have.

553
00:43:25,437 --> 00:43:28,983
- But the test requires 700.
- Stolyarchuk, let's get ready.

554
00:43:29,066 --> 00:43:30,746
- Switch on pump four.
- No, wait a second.

555
00:43:30,818 --> 00:43:32,837
- Stolyarchuk...
- We have barely enough steam as it is.

556
00:43:32,861 --> 00:43:35,340
The turbine is going too slow for
the test to deliver any valid results.

557
00:43:35,364 --> 00:43:36,800
- It's enough.
- And if we add more water,

558
00:43:36,824 --> 00:43:38,551
- there will be even less...
- I said it's enough.

559
00:43:38,575 --> 00:43:39,975
I know what I'm doing. Stolyarchuk.

560
00:43:46,083 --> 00:43:47,459
Main pump four, connected.

561
00:43:47,835 --> 00:43:49,604
We should warn Khodemchuk.
The pipes are gonna be...

562
00:43:49,628 --> 00:43:51,130
Never mind him. Kirschenbaum?

563
00:43:54,508 --> 00:43:57,219
The steam in the separator drum
is too low, five atmospheres.

564
00:43:57,303 --> 00:44:00,014
All right, let's all help him.
Get it up as best you can.

565
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:05,394
We should stop.

566
00:44:06,061 --> 00:44:07,730
Turn that fucking thing off.

567
00:44:08,897 --> 00:44:10,524
You have 15 minutes.

568
00:44:12,401 --> 00:44:13,569
<i>Fifteen minutes.</i>

569
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:17,239
<i>They may as well have had 15 days.</i>

570
00:44:17,573 --> 00:44:20,326
The problem they were facing
was not solvable.

571
00:44:20,409 --> 00:44:23,037
The power was too low.
The water was too high.

572
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,747
The test was already ruined.

573
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:27,791
The results would have been useless,
but Dyatlov didn't care.

574
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:30,919
All he wanted to do was
report a completed test.

575
00:44:32,379 --> 00:44:34,506
<i>1:22 a.m.</i>

576
00:44:35,215 --> 00:44:37,092
<i>Less than two minutes remain.</i>

577
00:44:38,344 --> 00:44:42,306
<i>Yuvchenko, a mechanical engineer,
is in his office.</i>

578
00:44:46,518 --> 00:44:48,896
<i>Perevozchenko,
reactor section foreman,</i>

579
00:44:48,979 --> 00:44:50,147
<i>is in the refueling hall,</i>

580
00:44:50,731 --> 00:44:54,318
<i>high above the 1,000-ton
steel reactor cover.</i>

581
00:44:56,737 --> 00:44:58,739
<i>Degtaryenko, Khodemchuk,</i>

582
00:44:58,822 --> 00:45:01,617
<i>circulation operators,
are in the pump room.</i>

583
00:45:03,869 --> 00:45:07,122
None of them
have been told about the test.

584
00:45:07,206 --> 00:45:09,041
None of them know
what is about to happen.

585
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:14,880
<i>At 1:22 and 30 seconds,
Toptunov sees a report</i>

586
00:45:15,756 --> 00:45:18,592
<i>from the reactor's
SKALA computer system.</i>

587
00:45:19,802 --> 00:45:23,138
<i>Based on the absence
of sufficient control rods,</i>

588
00:45:23,222 --> 00:45:26,392
<i>the computer is recommending
that the reactor be shut down.</i>

589
00:45:32,314 --> 00:45:35,114
Well, of course it's saying that.
It doesn't know we're running a test.

590
00:45:36,944 --> 00:45:38,028
All right, comrades.

591
00:45:39,863 --> 00:45:42,366
Another few minutes,
it will all be over.

592
00:45:42,449 --> 00:45:43,826
Kirschenbaum, when you're ready.

593
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,245
We did everything right.

594
00:45:48,747 --> 00:45:50,249
Oscillograph on.

595
00:45:52,292 --> 00:45:53,961
Closing number eight throttle valve.

596
00:45:55,087 --> 00:45:56,630
Generator rotor
beginning rundown.

597
00:45:57,089 --> 00:45:59,800
<i>1:23 and four seconds.</i>

598
00:46:00,634 --> 00:46:04,513
With every decision, they have pulled
this reactor back like a slingshot,

599
00:46:04,596 --> 00:46:06,640
further than anyone has ever pulled.

600
00:46:07,224 --> 00:46:08,809
Now the test begins.

601
00:46:09,351 --> 00:46:12,312
The pumps are shut down,
and they've let go.

602
00:46:15,441 --> 00:46:18,193
The pumps stop moving water
through the reactor.

603
00:46:18,861 --> 00:46:21,947
Uranium fuel is now
unchecked by fresh coolant,

604
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:23,991
unchecked by control rods.

605
00:46:24,074 --> 00:46:27,077
The balance immediately swings
in the opposite direction.

606
00:46:27,161 --> 00:46:30,289
In less than a second,
reactivity increases.

607
00:46:31,623 --> 00:46:33,041
<i>Inside the core,</i>

608
00:46:33,125 --> 00:46:35,461
<i>the remaining water is
quickly converting to steam.</i>

609
00:46:35,544 --> 00:46:37,713
<i>A void is being created.</i>

610
00:46:37,796 --> 00:46:40,340
<i>There is no fresh water to replace it.</i>

611
00:46:40,424 --> 00:46:43,343
Steam increases reactivity,

612
00:46:43,427 --> 00:46:46,722
increases heat, increases steam,

613
00:46:46,805 --> 00:46:48,432
increases reactivity.

614
00:46:49,725 --> 00:46:52,769
The remaining xenon decays away.

615
00:46:54,188 --> 00:46:55,689
The power is rising.

616
00:46:57,983 --> 00:46:59,485
There's nothing left to stop it.

617
00:47:00,861 --> 00:47:04,281
<i>1:23 and 35 seconds.</i>

618
00:47:07,618 --> 00:47:09,703
We have a power surge! Sasha!

619
00:47:15,209 --> 00:47:16,335
What did you do?

620
00:47:16,919 --> 00:47:20,130
1:23 and 40 seconds.

621
00:47:28,347 --> 00:47:30,849
In every control room
of every nuclear reactor in the world,

622
00:47:30,933 --> 00:47:34,102
there is a button
with one single purpose,

623
00:47:34,186 --> 00:47:37,606
to "scram," or instantly
shut down the reaction.

624
00:47:37,689 --> 00:47:40,943
In Soviet reactors,
that button is called AZ-5.

625
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:43,904
You press AZ-5,

626
00:47:43,987 --> 00:47:46,198
all of the control rods
insert at once,

627
00:47:46,281 --> 00:47:49,826
and the reaction is stopped dead.

628
00:47:50,911 --> 00:47:52,079
But...

629
00:47:58,627 --> 00:47:59,979
What are you waiting for, Legasov?

630
00:48:00,003 --> 00:48:01,922
Tell your lies.

631
00:48:02,005 --> 00:48:04,216
Comrade Dyatlov,
you will not be warned again.

632
00:48:04,299 --> 00:48:06,510
- Or what?
- For God's sake, Dyatlov.

633
00:48:06,593 --> 00:48:08,595
- Legasov's already given it away.
- That's enough.

634
00:48:08,679 --> 00:48:11,723
He said before there was no way
to avoid what was coming.

635
00:48:11,807 --> 00:48:13,433
- He knows something.
- Comrade Dyatlov.

636
00:48:13,517 --> 00:48:15,102
She knows something.

637
00:48:16,395 --> 00:48:18,438
I know what you are,
Valery Alexeyevich.

638
00:48:18,522 --> 00:48:21,525
- You're a liar.
- We've heard enough for today.

639
00:48:22,693 --> 00:48:25,404
The defendants will be
remanded in custody.

640
00:48:25,487 --> 00:48:28,490
- Court will...
- I haven't finished.

641
00:48:28,574 --> 00:48:30,701
I still have more evidence to give.

642
00:48:30,784 --> 00:48:34,079
It's not necessary.
Your testimony is concluded.

643
00:48:34,162 --> 00:48:37,332
- Your Honor.
- Court is now adjourned.

644
00:48:37,416 --> 00:48:39,626
- We will resume tomorrow with...
- Let him finish.

645
00:48:42,337 --> 00:48:43,672
Comrade Shcherbina...

646
00:48:46,425 --> 00:48:47,467
Let him finish.

647
00:49:12,743 --> 00:49:15,078
Dyatlov broke every rule we have.

648
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:21,918
He pushed a reactor
to the brink of destruction.

649
00:49:26,465 --> 00:49:29,051
He did these things believing
there was a failsafe.

650
00:49:29,134 --> 00:49:32,596
AZ-5, a simple button
to shut it all down.

651
00:49:32,679 --> 00:49:37,225
But in the circumstances he created,
there wasn't.

652
00:49:37,309 --> 00:49:40,520
The shutdown system had a fatal flaw.

653
00:49:42,648 --> 00:49:47,903
At 1:23:40, Akimov engages AZ-5.

654
00:49:55,952 --> 00:49:59,748
The fully withdrawn control rods
begin moving back into the reactor.

655
00:49:59,831 --> 00:50:02,501
These rods are made of boron,
which reduces reactivity,

656
00:50:02,584 --> 00:50:03,669
but not their tips.

657
00:50:04,503 --> 00:50:08,799
The tips are made of graphite,
which accelerates reactivity.

658
00:50:09,299 --> 00:50:10,300
Why?

659
00:50:14,971 --> 00:50:16,098
Why?

660
00:50:18,725 --> 00:50:21,019
For the same reason our reactors

661
00:50:21,103 --> 00:50:23,188
do not have containment
buildings around them,

662
00:50:24,147 --> 00:50:25,273
like those in the West.

663
00:50:25,357 --> 00:50:30,070
For the same reason we don't use
properly enriched fuel in our cores.

664
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,656
For the same reason
we are the only nation

665
00:50:32,739 --> 00:50:37,077
that builds water-cooled,
graphite-moderated reactors

666
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:39,621
with a positive void coefficient.

667
00:50:41,498 --> 00:50:42,541
It's cheaper.

668
00:50:48,755 --> 00:50:50,006
The first part

669
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:51,883
of the rods that enter the core

670
00:50:51,967 --> 00:50:53,301
are the graphite tips.

671
00:50:53,385 --> 00:50:55,721
And when they do,
the reaction in the core,

672
00:50:55,804 --> 00:50:58,682
which had been rising, skyrockets.

673
00:50:58,765 --> 00:51:03,770
Every last molecule of liquid water
instantly converts to steam,

674
00:51:03,854 --> 00:51:07,149
which expands and ruptures
a series of fuel rod channels.

675
00:51:07,232 --> 00:51:11,319
The control rods in those
channels can move no further.

676
00:51:11,403 --> 00:51:13,864
The graphite tips
are fixed in position,

677
00:51:13,947 --> 00:51:16,825
endlessly accelerating the reaction.

678
00:51:16,908 --> 00:51:20,746
Chernobyl Reactor 4
is now a nuclear bomb.

679
00:51:21,288 --> 00:51:23,832
<i>1:23:42.</i>

680
00:51:23,915 --> 00:51:27,878
<i>Perevozchenko looks down on
the enormous steel lid of the reactor</i>

681
00:51:27,961 --> 00:51:29,963
<i>and sees the impossible.</i>

682
00:51:30,046 --> 00:51:31,840
<i>The control rod and fuel channel caps,</i>

683
00:51:31,923 --> 00:51:34,009
<i>which each weigh 350 kilograms,</i>

684
00:51:34,092 --> 00:51:35,761
<i>are jumping up and down.</i>

685
00:51:36,303 --> 00:51:38,513
<i>He runs to warn the control room.</i>

686
00:51:38,597 --> 00:51:41,516
<i>But there's nothing he can do
to stop what is coming.</i>

687
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:44,603
<i>1:23 and 44 seconds.</i>

688
00:51:45,228 --> 00:51:48,648
<i>The steam blows
more fuel channels apart.</i>

689
00:51:48,732 --> 00:51:50,776
<i>We do not know
how high the power went.</i>

690
00:51:50,859 --> 00:51:52,099
<i>We only know the final reading.</i>

691
00:51:54,654 --> 00:51:59,201
Reactor 4, designed to operate
at 3,200 megawatts,

692
00:51:59,951 --> 00:52:02,496
went beyond 33,000.

693
00:52:08,251 --> 00:52:12,047
The pressure inside the core
can no longer be held back.

694
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:18,428
At long last, we have arrived.
1:23:45, explosion.

695
00:52:20,055 --> 00:52:23,016
<i>In the instant the lid is
thrown off the reactor,</i>

696
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:24,142
<i>oxygen rushes in.</i>

697
00:52:24,226 --> 00:52:28,313
<i>It combines with hydrogen
and super-heated graphite.</i>

698
00:52:30,357 --> 00:52:33,193
<i>The chain of disaster is now complete.</i>

699
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:56,758
Comrade Dyatlov!

700
00:53:02,013 --> 00:53:03,348
Comrade Dyatlov!

701
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:17,737
No one in the room
that night knew

702
00:53:17,821 --> 00:53:20,991
the shutdown button
could act as a detonator.

703
00:53:22,617 --> 00:53:23,952
They didn't know it,

704
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:27,622
because it was kept from them.

705
00:53:27,706 --> 00:53:32,460
Comrade Legasov, you're contradicting
your own testimony in Vienna.

706
00:53:32,878 --> 00:53:34,838
My testimony in Vienna was a lie.

707
00:53:36,339 --> 00:53:38,633
I lied to the world.

708
00:53:39,467 --> 00:53:41,303
I'm not the only one
who kept this secret.

709
00:53:41,386 --> 00:53:42,387
There are many.

710
00:53:43,972 --> 00:53:45,390
We were following orders,

711
00:53:46,975 --> 00:53:48,602
from the KGB,
from the Central Committee.

712
00:53:48,685 --> 00:53:51,229
And right now, there are
16 reactors in the Soviet Union

713
00:53:51,313 --> 00:53:53,773
with the same fatal flaw.

714
00:53:53,857 --> 00:53:55,734
Three of them are still running

715
00:53:55,817 --> 00:53:58,236
less than 20 kilometers away
at Chernobyl.

716
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:02,240
Professor Legasov, if you mean
to suggest the Soviet state

717
00:54:02,324 --> 00:54:04,159
is somehow responsible
for what happened,

718
00:54:04,242 --> 00:54:06,953
then I must warn you, you are
treading on dangerous ground.

719
00:54:07,662 --> 00:54:09,331
I've already trod on dangerous ground.

720
00:54:09,414 --> 00:54:11,458
We're on dangerous ground right now,

721
00:54:11,541 --> 00:54:14,294
because of our secrets and our lies.

722
00:54:14,377 --> 00:54:17,422
They're practically what define us.

723
00:54:17,505 --> 00:54:20,717
When the truth offends, we lie and lie

724
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,053
until we can no longer
remember it is even there.

725
00:54:23,136 --> 00:54:24,721
But it is still there.

726
00:54:28,391 --> 00:54:32,437
Every lie we tell incurs
a debt to the truth.

727
00:54:34,814 --> 00:54:36,983
Sooner or later, that debt is paid.

728
00:54:41,905 --> 00:54:46,826
That is how an RBMK
reactor core explodes.

729
00:54:50,872 --> 00:54:51,873
Lies.

730
00:56:56,539 --> 00:56:58,833
Valery Alexeyevich Legasov,

731
00:57:00,418 --> 00:57:02,629
son of Alexei Legasov,

732
00:57:02,837 --> 00:57:05,298
Head of Ideological Compliance,
Central Committee.

733
00:57:06,341 --> 00:57:07,861
Do you know
what your father did there?

734
00:57:08,176 --> 00:57:09,177
Yes.

735
00:57:10,553 --> 00:57:13,890
As a student, you had a
leadership position in Komsomol.

736
00:57:13,973 --> 00:57:16,017
Communist Youth, correct?

737
00:57:17,393 --> 00:57:19,312
- You already know.
- Answer the question.

738
00:57:19,729 --> 00:57:20,772
Yes.

739
00:57:22,774 --> 00:57:24,776
At the Kurchatov Institute,

740
00:57:24,859 --> 00:57:27,028
you were the
Communist Party secretary.

741
00:57:27,737 --> 00:57:31,407
In the position, you limited
the promotion of Jewish scientists.

742
00:57:36,371 --> 00:57:37,956
Yes.

743
00:57:38,039 --> 00:57:40,667
To curry favor with Kremlin officials.

744
00:57:46,297 --> 00:57:48,174
You're one of us, Legasov.

745
00:57:50,009 --> 00:57:51,886
I can do anything I want with you.

746
00:57:53,638 --> 00:57:56,516
But what I want the most is
for you to know that I know.

747
00:57:57,809 --> 00:57:59,310
You're not brave.

748
00:58:00,854 --> 00:58:02,313
You're not heroic.

749
00:58:03,982 --> 00:58:07,360
You're just a dying man
who forgot himself.

750
00:58:07,443 --> 00:58:10,905
I know who I am,
and I know what I've done.

751
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:16,077
In a just world,
I'd be shot for my lies,

752
00:58:16,161 --> 00:58:18,371
but not for this, not for the truth.

753
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:21,499
Scientists,

754
00:58:21,583 --> 00:58:25,295
and your idiot obsession
with reasons.

755
00:58:25,378 --> 00:58:29,799
When the bullet hits
your skull, what will it matter why?

756
00:58:37,473 --> 00:58:39,809
No one's getting shot, Legasov.

757
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:43,188
The whole world saw you in Vienna.

758
00:58:44,022 --> 00:58:46,107
It would be embarrassing
to kill you now.

759
00:58:46,191 --> 00:58:47,233
And for what?

760
00:58:48,610 --> 00:58:51,654
Your testimony today
will not be accepted by the State.

761
00:58:51,738 --> 00:58:54,073
It will not be disseminated
in the press.

762
00:58:54,741 --> 00:58:56,576
It never happened.

763
00:58:57,952 --> 00:59:02,207
No, you will live,
however long you have,

764
00:59:02,999 --> 00:59:05,752
but not as a scientist, not anymore.

765
00:59:06,753 --> 00:59:10,715
You'll keep your title
and your office,

766
00:59:11,925 --> 00:59:16,262
but no duties,
no authority, no friends.

767
00:59:16,346 --> 00:59:17,680
No one will talk to you.

768
00:59:18,514 --> 00:59:19,891
No one will listen to you.

769
00:59:22,352 --> 00:59:25,772
Other men, lesser men,

770
00:59:26,898 --> 00:59:29,609
will receive credit
for the things you have done.

771
00:59:30,568 --> 00:59:32,862
Your legacy is now their legacy.

772
00:59:32,946 --> 00:59:35,156
You'll live long enough to see that.

773
00:59:39,118 --> 00:59:40,954
What role did Shcherbina play in this?

774
00:59:41,704 --> 00:59:42,789
None.

775
00:59:42,872 --> 00:59:44,707
He didn't know what I was gonna say.

776
00:59:46,626 --> 00:59:48,711
What role did Khomyuk play in this?

777
00:59:49,379 --> 00:59:50,380
None.

778
00:59:51,256 --> 00:59:52,674
She didn't know either.

779
00:59:55,218 --> 00:59:57,679
After all you've said and done today,

780
00:59:57,762 --> 01:00:03,393
it would be curious
if you chose this moment to lie.

781
01:00:06,604 --> 01:00:10,608
I would think a man of your experience
would know a lie when he hears one.

782
01:00:14,946 --> 01:00:17,949
You will not meet or communicate
with either one of them ever again.

783
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:22,912
You will not communicate with anyone
about Chernobyl ever again.

784
01:00:24,414 --> 01:00:26,666
You will remain so immaterial
to the world around you

785
01:00:26,749 --> 01:00:28,626
that when you finally do die,

786
01:00:29,252 --> 01:00:32,839
it will be exceedingly hard
to know that you ever lived at all.

787
01:00:37,302 --> 01:00:39,012
And if I refuse?

788
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:45,310
Why worry about something
that isn't going to happen?

789
01:00:46,728 --> 01:00:49,939
"Why worry about something
that isn't going to happen?"

790
01:00:50,898 --> 01:00:52,442
Oh, that's perfect.

791
01:00:53,318 --> 01:00:55,153
They should put that on our money.

792
01:02:05,598 --> 01:02:08,351
<i>To be a scientist is to be naive.</i>

793
01:02:09,685 --> 01:02:12,021
<i>We are so focused
on our search for truth,</i>

794
01:02:12,105 --> 01:02:16,275
<i>we fail to consider how few
actually want us to find it.</i>

795
01:02:16,818 --> 01:02:21,030
<i>But it is always there,
whether we see it or not,</i>

796
01:02:21,114 --> 01:02:23,074
<i>whether we choose to or not.</i>

797
01:02:23,157 --> 01:02:25,868
<i>The truth doesn't care
about our needs or wants.</i>

798
01:02:25,952 --> 01:02:27,620
<i>It doesn't care about our governments,</i>

799
01:02:27,703 --> 01:02:30,039
<i>our ideologies, our religions.</i>

800
01:02:31,499 --> 01:02:33,960
<i>It will lie in wait for all time.</i>

801
01:02:35,253 --> 01:02:39,173
<i>And this, at last,
is the gift of Chernobyl.</i>

802
01:02:39,257 --> 01:02:41,717
<i>Where I once would fear
the cost of truth,</i>

803
01:02:41,801 --> 01:02:43,428
<i>now I only ask,</i>

804
01:02:45,596 --> 01:02:47,557
<i>"What is the cost of lies?"</i>
