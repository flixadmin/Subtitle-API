<i>Previously

2
00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:05,203
<i>I want to break up Firestorm.</i>

3
00:00:05,297 --> 00:00:07,400
If you guys are getting cold feet,
we can call the whole thing off.

4
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,344
<i>It's time for Jefferson to claim</i>

5
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:11,376
<i>the power of Firestorm for himself.</i>

6
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:13,260
<i>This totem is my family's.</i>

7
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:15,509
- Only my blood may bear it.
- And they do.

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,307
- That's impossible.
- That I am your granddaughter?

9
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:20,726
What does Darhk care
if we fix anachronisms or not?

10
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:22,599
<i>That's the thing
about daughters.</i>

11
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,853
<i>When they see you die at the hands
of one self-righteous hero,</i>

12
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:27,809
they really don't want to see it
happen again.

13
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:30,343
<i>We're stronger together.
We know that. Darhk knows that.</i>

14
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:48,685
Still nothing.

15
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,518
- What are you doing, Grey?
- Oh.

16
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:54,480
Since Gideon took Sara off sedatives,

17
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:58,408
I've been looking for a salient stimulus
to pull her out of her coma.

18
00:01:58,493 --> 00:01:59,700
What the hell is that?

19
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,403
Salient stimulus, a noise or sound

20
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:06,457
she might have an emotional connection
to, that will wake her up.

21
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:08,539
Here. Would you like to give it a try?

22
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,712
No. Actually,

23
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,289
I was wondering if you needed help
with our other project.

24
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:15,792
Uncoupling Firestorm.

25
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,343
Oh. Yes. Yes, that project.

26
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:23,346
I've been looking into those equations,
and it's very promising, indeed.

27
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:27,972
All of Firestorm's power
will safely reside in you.

28
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:30,084
Well, you're the smartest man I know.

29
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,753
So, if anybody can figure it out,
it's you.

30
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:33,268
That's why the smartest man you know

31
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:36,776
is heading right back to the lab
to double-check his calculations.

32
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:45,787
Everything okay?

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,617
You've been hitting the bag
like it's insulted your mother.

34
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,873
And you haven't said anything for,
like, 30 minutes.

35
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:53,879
What's there to say?

36
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:56,628
I don't know.
Talk about your granddaughter?

37
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:03,139
And not the super-hero, either.
The psycho water witch.

38
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:04,557
The who?

39
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:07,681
Your granddaughter. I mean,
I'm sure she's really not that bad.

40
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,415
You just called her a
"psycho water-witch."

41
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:14,355
Yeah, and I instantly regret it.
I'm sure she's just, you know, confused.

42
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:17,020
Well, I'm not.

43
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:20,403
Kuasa and I will confront
each other again. It's inevitable.

44
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:24,156
When we do,
I won't hesitate to stop her.

45
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,994
Even if she's my granddaughter.

46
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,750
Okay. Good talk.
Way to get the emotions out.

47
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:35,501
I really wish I had
better news about Sara.

48
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,797
But she's still in the coma

49
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,920
thanks to Damien Darhk's daughter
laying her out.

50
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,423
Well, in the meantime,
we could do what we do best,

51
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:42,924
and fix a few anachronisms?

52
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:45,927
How about you drop me off
on an island full of beautiful women,

53
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:48,304
like Zari did with that Helen chick?

54
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,727
Rory, you weren't supposed to
say anything.

55
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:53,477
Wait, you didn't take Helen
back to Troy, where she belongs?

56
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:58,107
That's what the Time Bureau does.
But we, we do something different.

57
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:01,655
No, we do it different-ly.

58
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:04,029
Yeah. More messy.

59
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,489
Okay. If you look
at the historical record,

60
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,243
the Trojan War happens
with or without Helen.

61
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,411
See. No Anachronism.

62
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,896
How do you think the Captain would
feel about you re-engineering time?

63
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,958
We can argue about that later
because I know exactly what she'd say

64
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,040
if she wakes up
and finds us doing nothing.

65
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:20,966
We owe it to Sara
to keep doing our job.

66
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,090
So, where do we start?

67
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,718
Well, I was thinking we just

68
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:29,138
leave it up to chance
and my index finger.

69
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:36,733
Oof. Vietnam, 1967? Also known as
the height of the Vietnam War?

70
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,769
Gideon, what kind of anachronism
are we dealing with?

71
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:41,195
<i>A Level 8.</i>

72
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,069
<i>Scans of the historical record reveal
redacted Pentagon reports</i>

73
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,570

<i>Dozens have disappeared

76
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:51,990
No way I'm going to 'Nam.

77
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,395
All I know is that if
American soldiers are being targeted,

78
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:55,751
I'm ready to do my duty.

79
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:58,250
This war is a little different.

80
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,831
<i>Unlike World War II,</i>

81
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:02,793
the military objectives in Vietnam
weren't so cut and dry.

82
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:06,846
Yeah. It was controversial. And the
reasons for getting involved were murky.

83
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:10,717
Well, come to think about it,
this team should be right at home.

84
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,944
Sole survivor of the last patrol
attacked is named Ryan Sanders.

85
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,261
He's supposed to be on R&R here.

86
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:30,449
This doesn't look like a good place
for American GIs to rest and recuperate.

87
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,539
<i>Looks more like
they're just trying to escape.</i>

88
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:34,206
Hey, I found our guy.

89
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:44,467
Mr. Sanders,
we're with the Associated Press.

90
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:48,467
We wanted to ask you a few questions
about what happened with your squad.

91
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,387
- I don't want to talk about it.
- We won't take up much of your time.

92
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,184
Yeah, people need to hear your story.

93
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:56,183
You could save lives
telling us what you saw.

94
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:00,145
It must have stalked us
for several klicks.

95
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:01,646
Took us by surprise.

96
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,689
Whatever was out there, was pure evil.

97
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,773
And it had a message for us.

98
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:10,868
Stay out of the jungle.

99
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,166
<i>I hate the jungle.</i>

100
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:20,833
- You sure this is the right way?
- Well, according to the field reports,

101
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:23,839
the last known location
of Alpha Team was right...

102
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,257
<i>Here.</i>

103
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,427
I should have stayed in Aruba.

104
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,423
<i>What could have taken out
a whole patrol of U.S. soldiers?</i>

105
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:36,136
Nothing good. But this missing squad
is gonna stay missing.

106
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,104
Let's get out of here.

107
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,335
I hope Mick and Nate
are watching their backs.

108
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,772
If what Sanders said is true,
they're in real danger.

109
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:46,980
Who knows if what he said was true.
He was clearly intoxicated.

110
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:48,318
Forget about him.

111
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,196
Think I found someone
who can tell us what's going on.

112
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:53,820
Hey, you've been staring at us
since we got here.

113
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,746
I heard you asking about the jungle.

114
00:06:57,042 --> 00:07:00,456
It can be a dangerous place
even if you are carrying a machine gun.

115
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:02,544
- Well, we're journalists here...
- Eh.

116
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,254
Who the hell are you?

117
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:09,423
My name is Anh Ly.
And I know what's out in that jungle.

118
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,282
You've seen
what's been attacking the soldiers?

119
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:13,889
Attacking them? Come with me.

120
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:18,436
I won't just tell you what's happening.
I'll show you.

121
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:24,317
- Too many trees! Too many plants!
- We'll be back in concrete in no time.

122
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:27,440
Ah! Bugs! Flies!

123
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,398
What's going on with you?
You're grumpier than usual.

124
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:32,404
What? I'm in a good mood.

125
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:36,325
Is it because I made your boots too big?
Look, I forget you've got small feet.

126
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:38,330
And why would you not want
to come to Vietnam?

127
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,204
This place was, like, made for you!

128
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,336
- My dad.
- What about him?

129
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,539
He's here. 'Nam. The war.

130
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:49,113
Oh, buddy, you don't really think
you're gonna see him, do you?

131
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:50,505
There's almost no chance

132
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,837
we're gonna run into your father
in a jungle this big.

133
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:55,173
You said "almost."
Meaning there is a chance.

134
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,425
I'll buy you a six-pack
if we bump into him.

135
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,017
Hands up, pretty boy!

136
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,607
You owe me a six-pack.

137
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,355
No.

138
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,032
Hands up. Now.

139
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:27,417
Dude, what are you doing?

140
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,922
I'm Operations Officer Nathaniel Heywood
with the CIA.

141
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:36,131
This is my partner,
Officer Schwarzenegger.

142
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,682
We're here to investigate
the disappearance of Alpha Team.

143
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,807
Can't be too careful.

144
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,318
Sergeant Dick Rory, Echo Team.

145
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,901
<i>I think it's in our
mutual best interest</i>

146
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:58,635
if we conduct
this investigation together,

147
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,424
- find out what happened to our men.
- Actually, we were just leaving.

148
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,706
Sounds like a plan.

149
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,330
But I gotta say, your partner here
doesn't look so gung-ho.

150
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,294
Give us a minute.

151
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,801
Look, I'm sorry you have to see
your father, but you need to suck it up.

152
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:21,722
If it wasn't for
this time-traveling stuff,

153
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,765
I would have
never run into that bastard.

154
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,972
Okay. You know what,
we are changing this operation.

155
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,103
This has become Operation Tough Love.

156
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,643
Yeah. I'm gonna go
all Dr. Phil on your ass.

157
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,734
It's time for you to man up
and sort out...

158
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,030
Daddy issues.

159
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:38,700
I was going to say "unresolved grief,"
but let's go with what you're saying.

160
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,569
You wanna know
why I've never seen a shrink?

161
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:44,539
- Why?
- I don't regret killing my old man.

162
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:49,750
- What?
- That's right, pretty. You heard me.

163
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:53,878
I let my old man burn to death.

164
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,925
How's that for tough love?

165
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,313
Oh, hell no!

166
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,570
What kind of monster
eats my mom's pecan pie,

167
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:17,649
and puts the container back
in the fridge?

168
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,864
Gideon, who is the thief?

169
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:24,030
There must be a theorem
that supports the deceleration

170
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:29,210
of a subject's rate of fission
to individually power the thermocore.

171
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,420
Any insights, Sir Isaac Newton?

172
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:33,623
Or do I have to throw
an apple at your head?

173
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,799
Perhaps if you afforded us
a brief reprieve.

174
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,093
We've been working for hours.

175
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:41,468
And when, dare I ask,
do I get to return home?

176
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,766
You'll go home
when I say you can, Galileo.

177
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:48,972
What about you, Madame Curie?
You've been awfully quiet.

178
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,607
How many times do I have to
explain it to you, Martin?

179
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:55,440
There is only one way
to safely split the thermocore.

180
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:58,648
Yes, but doing so would result in
both Jefferson and I losing our powers.

181
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:01,905
I personally have no compunctions
about that, but Jefferson...

182
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,115
There you are.

183
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:07,476
My colleagues and I were just...

184
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,459
You didn't have to lie to me
if you couldn't find a solution, man.

185
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,511
Look, I'm sure it's not easy learning

186
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,620
that your granddaughter is in league
with Damien Darhk.

187
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:29,102
- If you ever wanna talk about it...
- What happened to men?

188
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,977
When did you all start talking
about your feelings?

189
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,607
Uh... Early '90s.

190
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:38,279
- You are unusual journalists.
- Tell me about it.

191
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,855
Most people run away when they hear

192
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,532
about a monster
grabbing soldiers in the jungle.

193
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:45,953
- Us, we run towards it.
- Monster?

194
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,538
What kind of monster
stops the fighting

195
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,708
between the Americans
and the Viet Cong?

196
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:55,872
He's no monster.
He's Ong Troi Moi, the New God.

197
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,219
Hey, what's going on?

198
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:08,259
Must be some sort of dead zone.

199
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:10,094
We are here.

200
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,308
Ray? Can you hear me?

201
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:18,277
Can't go a whole day
without talking to your boyfriend, huh?

202
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,812
I think their comms went out.

203
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,444
Don't drink the ground water.
It's probably contaminated.

204
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:27,327
Those are some pretty rough burns
you got there, son.

205
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:28,908
You get hit by napalm?

206
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:30,448
I ain't your son.

207
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,910
Yeah.

208
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:37,876
Do you know
what's on your father's head?

209
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:39,457
A little Frenchy hat?

210
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,041
That is a green beret.

211
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,296
President Kennedy called them

212
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,629
"a symbol of excellence,
a badge of courage."

213
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:45,838
- Courage?
- Yeah.

214
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:49,801
The only thing my old man was good at
was sitting in a chair,

215
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,102
<i>a cigarette in one hand,
and a beer in the other.</i>

216
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:55,811
And the only time
he ever got up was to...

217
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:00,611
No, Mick. Come on.
Come on. This is good.

218
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:04,652
This is good. Thanks to time travel,
I got to talk to my grandfather.

219
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,779
I got to work out
a lot of my father issues.

220
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,250
Stand down, stand down!

221
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:24,543
Is that you, Petey Adams?

222
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,219
<i>What are you doing out here
on your own?</i>

223
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:30,682
- You get lost, or something?
- Lost?

224
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,100
No. I've become enlightened.

225
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:36,726
You can be enlightened, too,
if you join us.

226
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:40,143
- Who's us?
<i>- This country does not belong to you.</i>

227
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,278
It belongs to Ong Troi Moi.

228
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:45,690
I don't like where this is heading.

229
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:51,029
You hand me that rifle, Petey.
We'll work on getting you a hot meal.

230
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,784
You will surrender to him.

231
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:54,911
Or die.

232
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,980
Get off me!

233
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,556
<i>Put 'em down!</i>

234
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,527
Bunch of damn traitors.

235
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,371
American and North Vietnamese
soldiers working arm-in-arm?

236
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:37,617
This anachronism is
even crazier than we thought.

237
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:41,412
And I think I know how they're
blocking our communications.

238
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,673
Hey, what is this place? I thought
we were looking for a monster.

239
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,959
You wish to speak to Ong Troi Moi?

240
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:49,420
I've got a really bad feeling
about this.

241
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,797
We would be honored.

242
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:07,405
We have guests.
They're reporters as you wanted.

243
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:21,118
<i>I am Grodd.</i>

244
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:31,136
<i>Welcome to my kingdom.</i>

245
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:38,344
You saw what I saw, right?

246
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:41,021
There was a gorilla sitting
on a throne?

247
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,015
He spoke better English than Mick.

248
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:47,444
Well, he's clearly intelligent enough to
trick these GIs to abandon their posts.

249
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:50,861
He's a monster.
He needs to be stopped.

250
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,738
He's turned these men
into his slaves.

251
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,153
Ong Troi Moi freed these soldiers.

252
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:58,785
He is the reason they are
no longer killing one another.

253
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,208
Yeah, it's a real utopia
he's created for himself.

254
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:05,880
I brought you here to help spread
Ong Troi Moi's message to the world.

255
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,628
You are only here
to document what you see.

256
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:10,671
Of course.

257
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:19,601
I need your shrink-ray.

258
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,553
Uh... Dislike that the name
is catching on.

259
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:23,083
Look, even if you can miniaturize Grodd,

260
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:25,627
there's still ten miles of jungle
warfare between us and the <i>Waverider.</i>

261
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,643
Yeah. Which is why
you guys are going to take down

262
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:29,537
the communications jammer
and call for backup.

263
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:30,572
While you take down

264
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,943
a hyper-intelligent telepathic
primate by yourself?

265
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:36,444
All I need is one clean shot.

266
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,792
You saved my life today.

267
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:57,973
Didn't wanna have to put you on my list.

268
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:04,435
These are the names of all the men
who died under my watch.

269
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:08,187
I keep them with me
to remind myself it's my job

270
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,063
to protect my men, get them back home.

271
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,736
That's my girl.
Gonna marry her when I get back.

272
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:22,080
Quit looking at her.

273
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:30,456
Maybe even start a family someday.

274
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,916
You want kids?

275
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,090
Why not?

276
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,719
As long as they never end up
in some godforsaken jungle.

277
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:43,351
I've seen things out here,

278
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:47,856
hope I never bring home with me.

279
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:57,901
I've never told anybody this before,
but I'm scared.

280
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:04,874
I don't know who I am
if I'm not a part of Firestorm.

281
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:08,080
But then, you've never had
any superpowers.

282
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:13,336
That's never stopped you from being
the most kick-ass person I've ever met.

283
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:22,095
Well, good talk, Captain.

284
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,112
Wow!

285
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,996
<i>I knew Grodd
was a power-hungry tyrant, but...</i>

286
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,873
<i>He's one hell
of an electrical engineer.</i>

287
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:41,326
The key is to jam the jammer
without anyone realizing it's jammed.

288
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,696
- Does that make sense?
- Perfect.

289
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:47,499
Where are we taking Grodd when
we return him to where he belongs?

290
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:50,794
Well, last I heard
he was in an A.R.G.U.S. prison.

291
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,797
Wait, he's just
another persecuted meta?

292
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:58,548
Okay, I know you're not a fan of
A.R.G.U.S., but Grodd is a psychopath.

293
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:01,631
And, well, a giant gorilla.

294
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,727
Ray? Jax? Can you hear me?

295
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,679
I think there's
something up with Mick.

296
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:12,437
He's got that look.
You know, when his eyes get all crazed.

297
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:15,769
I think the jungle's
finally getting to him.

298
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:18,648
Hey, man, you good?

299
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:20,824
Mick?

300
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:24,410
- What are you doing?
- What's it look like?

301
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:25,578
Uh...

302
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:31,035
Look like you were...

303
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,957
Burning your own skin.

304
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:37,129
But that would be
completely insane, right?

305
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:42,174
My whole life, I saw him as a monster.

306
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:47,472
Blamed him for
all the sick things that I've done.

307
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:48,935
But now, I see...

308
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,726
I'm worse than him.

309
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:58,695
Should've been me
that burned in that house.

310
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:06,907
Ha!

311
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,488
- You're a genius.
- Thanks.

312
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,289
- Sorry. I was talking to myself.
- Huh?

313
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:14,415
- Hello? Can anybody hear me?
- Nate, is that you?

314
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:17,960
Yes. Our comms are down.

315
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,810
No, no, no. They were jammed.
I just fixed...

316
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:22,173
I mean, Zari unjammed it.

317
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:24,282
Where are you guys? We need to
get out of this jungle ASAP.

318
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,218
Oh, no. What's wrong, buddy?

319
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,093
Well, when Mick and I started,
we were doing <i>Predator.</i>

320
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:32,516
Then we ran into Mick's dad,
and now we're doing <i>Apocalypse Now.</i>

321
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,598
That's why Mick didn't want to
come to Vietnam

322
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:36,524
on the off-chance
he'd run into his father.

323
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,851
Which is about as unlikely as

324
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:41,029
Marty meeting his
great-great grandfather Sir Stein.

325
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:44,108
Right. Or young you
befriending a time-displaced alien.

326
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,526
Do you people not hear me?

327
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:51,119
Listen. The monster/anachronism
is Gorilla Grodd.

328
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,454
We're stuck in his compound.

329
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:54,771
Did you just say Gorilla Grodd?

330
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:59,540
Grodd's displacement in 1967
probably explains that.

331
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:04,299
Guys, our anachronism just jumped
from an eight to a Level 10.

332
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,637
Gideon, what have you got?

333
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:07,403
<i>The time line
is currently in flux.</i>

334
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:10,141
<i>However, the following headline
recently appeared in my archives.</i>

335
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:13,602
It appears that

336
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:16,682
Grodd is using the powder keg
that is the Vietnam War

337
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,768
to somehow ignite World War III.

338
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:19,977
What?

339
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,424
Where's Amaya? We have to figure out
Grodd's plan and get out of here.

340
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:23,448
Yeah.

341
00:21:57,525 --> 00:22:01,018
<i>This is how you repay Grodd
for his hospitality,</i>

342
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:03,694
<i>by trying to kill me?</i>

343
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:07,525
<i>Let me help you
with that weapon of yours.</i>

344
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:13,405
<i>You think I am the enemy.</i>

345
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:18,168
<i>Look at what you humans
have done to one another.</i>

346
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,044
<i>Look at what humans did to me.</i>

347
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:31,431
So, you're raising an army of humans
to get your revenge?

348
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:34,225
<i>Revenge? No.</i>

349
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:40,641
<i>My only wish
is to help your kind find peace.</i>

350
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:42,809
And how do you plan to do that?

351
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:55,822
Welcome to Vietnam, Mr. President.

352
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,868
Good Lord, it's hotter
than a preacher's knee out here.

353
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:01,169
You hit the nail on the head,
Mr. President.

354
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:03,914
Follow me, we'll get you
into some air conditioning.

355
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,991
You're planning to kill the President?

356
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:43,123
We are defending our home
against those who have attacked us.

357
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:46,878
Which I'm all for, believe me,
but you need to draw a line somewhere.

358
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,879
Grodd is only doing what is necessary.

359
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,926
Necessary for who?

360
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:54,302
He only cares about himself.
That's how dictators work.

361
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:58,928
I have lost both my parents,

362
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:02,222
my brother, my village.

363
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:05,772
Ong Troi Moi is the only one left
to protect us.

364
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:11,815
I know what it's like to lose the
people you love in a senseless war.

365
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:14,784
Makes you desperate.

366
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:17,905
But if you really want peace,
it starts with you.

367
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:27,998
Did you guys hear that? They're
targeting the President's convoy.

368
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:40,010
- Anh is weak.
- Grodd...

369
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:50,604
- Where are you going?
- You heard Zari.

370
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:53,364
To save L.B.J. It sounds like
the team's got their hands full.

371
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:55,387
It's too dangerous.
We'll go together as Firestorm.

372
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:57,528
No, we won't.
I got to do this on my own.

373
00:24:57,705 --> 00:25:00,664
Please don't. I'm still working
on a way to split the thermocore.

374
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:03,909
Okay. I don't know if this is your
way of making yourself feel better

375
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:06,086
about us splitting up
by making sure I've got powers,

376
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,629
but I can do this without any.

377
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,883
And soon enough, I'm gonna have
to stand on my own without you.

378
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:20,221
We just intercepted
radio communications and triangulated

379
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,518
the enemy's position
to a base just east of here.

380
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:23,790
That's where they're holed up.

381
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:26,272
Don't know about you boys,
but I'm ready to go to work.

382
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:29,726
We can't let them get near that camp.

383
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,233
Okay. These yahoos are gonna shoot
anything that moves

384
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:33,483
and our friends are in there.

385
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:37,738
Amaya's in there. Do you hear me?

386
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:38,828
<i>You fellas ready?</i>

387
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:43,373
Actually, Sarge, you're gonna have to
tell your men to stand down.

388
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:46,827
I just received intel that
the encampment's in a no-fire zone.

389
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,707
Nobody told me about any intel.

390
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:50,793
Well, the intel was
on a need-to-know basis.

391
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:52,402
And you didn't need to know until now.

392
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:54,418
Can you explain the situation to my men?

393
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:56,594
Yeah. No problem.

394
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:58,717
Listen up...

395
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,933
I don't take orders from the CIA.

396
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:08,515
- You in, or you out, son?
- I'm in, Pops.

397
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,976
Figure of speech.

398
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:26,701
- What's going on?
- Grodd wants to start World War III.

399
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:28,956
The sooner your great nations
destroy one another,

400
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:30,286
the sooner there will be peace.

401
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:33,503
One nation under Grodd!

402
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:43,599
<i>The U.S. President
will pay for his atrocities.</i>

403
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:46,053
You don't have to do this
to get what you want.

404
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:51,520
She's right.
We're here to bring you home.

405
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,323
You have every right to be angry.

406
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:02,452
<i>This world is cruel.</i>

407
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:07,124
What was done to you by humans,
it's unforgivable.

408
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:11,293
But you must understand
that we are not here to hurt you.

409
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:14,418
<i>And how will you bring me back home?</i>

410
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:17,963
<i>Unless...</i>

411
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,461
<i>Ah.</i>

412
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:21,922
<i>You're time travelers.</i>

413
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,845
<i>I will not go with you.</i>

414
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:27,761
<i>There is nothing for me
where I'm from.</i>

415
00:27:27,855 --> 00:27:30,142
<i>- Only pain!</i>
- You're right.

416
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:31,856
Maybe we don't take you home.

417
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:32,942
We don't?

418
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:36,190
We can take you
to a time before humans.

419
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,563
A time where you can live out
your days in peace.

420
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:44,532
<i>And why would Grodd trust you?</i>

421
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:56,290
Because I'm different.

422
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:25,948
There's been a breach!
All squads defend the perimeter!

423
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:30,782
<i>- You betrayed me!</i>
- No!

424
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:32,910
I promise,
we had nothing to do with this!

425
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:54,810
I didn't mean for any of this to happen!
You have to believe me!

426
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:58,561
<i>Humans will always fear Grodd,
hunt Grodd.</i>

427
00:28:58,654 --> 00:29:02,238
<i>But with your time machine
at Grodd's command,</i>

428
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:05,154
<i>there will be no humans!</i>

429
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:08,202
<i>Grodd will alter
the course of evolution.</i>

430
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,701
<i>He will no longer need
a gorilla country.</i>

431
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:14,535
<i>Because Grodd will have
a gorilla planet!</i>

432
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:22,421
You better tell the Professor
he's gonna have company.

433
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:25,553
Who's in charge around here?

434
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,466
What in the world...

435
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,983
Get off of me!

436
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:43,738
Call in an air-strike!

437
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:46,441
We'll let napalm take care of
whatever the hell that was.

438
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:48,909
We've got deserters to deal with.

439
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,824
Raymond, I must have misheard you.

440
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,534
Did you say
Grodd was on his way here?

441
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,995
I sure did, man. He's planning
on stealing the <i>Waverider.</i>

442
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:02,799
I swear to you. If I die today
because of a telepathic gorilla,

443
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,591
I'm gonna be very upset.

444
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:06,318
Yeah. Well, then
get the <i>Waverider</i> moving.

445
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:10,006
Hands on your head, traitor.

446
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,848
Let's go. Move it.

447
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,937
- Amaya.
- Nathaniel.

448
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:18,686
- Shut up!
- Are you okay?

449
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,641
Yeah. Mick?

450
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:24,695
Mick. What's wrong with him?

451
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:26,356
I'm afraid he's gone full Kurtz.

452
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:30,069
- What does that mean?
- It's a movie reference.

453
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:32,695
Great movie, terrible situation.

454
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:37,580
They say life is the sum total
of all the choices you make.

455
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:39,585
As your misfortune sinks in,

456
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,625
maybe you wanna ask yourself

457
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:44,583
"What choices did I make
to find myself here?"

458
00:30:44,718 --> 00:30:45,925
<i>Today, I want payback</i>

459
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:49,261
for what that monster did
to my men, my brothers.

460
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:51,010
- Excuse me.
- Shut up.

461
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,182
- We're journalists.
- Shut up.

462
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,204
And we've uncovered a plot
to kill President Johnson.

463
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,748
We need to alert the proper authorities.

464
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:57,808
Shut up.

465
00:30:57,898 --> 00:30:59,389
- See?
- He's telling the truth.

466
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:03,477
The President landed in Vietnam.
But we can still save him.

467
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:06,446
You're reporters. What are you
gonna do, question him to safety?

468
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,147
It's a little more
complicated than that.

469
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:11,109
But just trust me, okay?
We're the good guys.

470
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:14,534
Haven't you heard?
There are no good guys here.

471
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:21,039
Stop!

472
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:23,212
Stop! Stop! Stop!

473
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,584
Wait! Wait!

474
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:29,135
No, don't shoot! Don't shoot!
I'm an American.

475
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:31,303
You've got to back the hell up.

476
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,473
Son, I'm gonna be on you
like a duck on a junebug

477
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:34,890
if we don't start moving again.

478
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:38,344
Mr. President,
your life's in danger. Okay?

479
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:41,681
That roadblock is a trap.
You've got to get back to base.

480
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:44,716
- Step back, sir...
- No, no, no, no!

481
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,407
Mr. President, stop!

482
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:57,080
Whoa, Mr. President!
Don't move! Don't move!

483
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:59,786
Enough talk.

484
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:09,049
Time to pay the entrance fee
to this circus.

485
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,509
- Don't.
- What are you doing?

486
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:17,182
- Saving your life.
- What are you talking about?

487
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:20,057
I know what's going on
in that head of yours.

488
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,688
But killing these people
is not gonna bring back your men.

489
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,436
What do you know about anything?

490
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:27,769
Mick, you do realize
what will happen if you kill him.

491
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:29,104
Don't care.

492
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:33,237
This is insubordination, son.
I wouldn't have expected that from you.

493
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:36,364
- Well, you don't know me.
- Lower your weapon.

494
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:39,034
Lower yours.

495
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:43,202
I've got nothing to lose.

496
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:46,955
But you do. You get to go home.

497
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:52,802
But if you kill these people,
you'll hear their screams forever.

498
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:57,215
And one day, when you have a family,

499
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:00,718
you won't be able to
look them in the eye.

500
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:04,936
Because this day,
this act you're about to commit,

501
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:07,483
will be burned
in your memory forever.

502
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:21,827
- Why'd you do that?
- I always wanted to.

503
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,659
<i>Route is clear. Weapons hot.</i>

504
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:27,999
Okay.

505
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,460
You guys walked through a mine field,

506
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:32,653
and I'm pretty sure you're caught
in a Soviet trip mine.

507
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:35,511
But by freezing it,
you should be able to step away.

508
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:36,597
"Should"?

509
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:41,722
Okay on the count of three,
I want you to step away slowly.

510
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:45,688
One, two, three.

511
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:01,074
I'll be a damn humdinger!

512
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:04,332
Sounds like our Viet Cong friends
are circling in.

513
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:07,660
Okay. Well, we better
hustle through this minefield.

514
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:13,875
Follow my lead, and, uh,
if I don't blow up,

515
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:16,586
- path's clear.
- And if you blow up?

516
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,546
Then you're on you're own, sir.

517
00:34:22,102 --> 00:34:25,095
- Well, that wasn't so hard.
<i>- That's because I'm helping.</i>

518
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:32,188
Is that your idea of helping?

519
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:34,111
<i>I'm afraid
we have an unexpected passenger.</i>

520
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:40,618
You're afraid?

521
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:44,872
- Follow my steps exactly.
- I wasn't planning on improvising.

522
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:01,096
Okay, come on, Mr. President.

523
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:05,552
<i>One more step. You got this. Come on.</i>

524
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:26,496
Where is Captain Lance when I need her?

525
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:32,119
Sara. What, were you

526
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:34,921
just waiting for the right moment
to make a dramatic entrance?

527
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,251
Are you all right?

528
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:41,338
There is no Sara.

529
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:42,550
What?

530
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:46,016
Only Grodd.

531
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:51,167
<i>It appears that the Captain is
under some sort of telepathic control.</i>

532
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:52,557
Really, Gideon? You think so?

533
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:56,360
I claim this ship for the New God.

534
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:59,484
Kneel before Gro...

535
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:04,823
Oh, how I do love proving
my Laws of Motion.

536
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:07,655
Please save that lecture
for another day.

537
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:10,992
<i>Professor Stein, a U.S. military
airstrike is approaching,</i>

538
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:13,453
<i>and Grodd is still clinging
to the</i> Waverider.

539
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:14,832
I have an idea.

540
00:36:32,232 --> 00:36:34,849
Hey, are you sure
you won't reconsider?

541
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:36,475
I can get you out of here.

542
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:39,695
You can start over somewhere
where there's no war.

543
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:42,151
No, my struggle is here.

544
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:47,071
I realize now, my people,
they do not need a god.

545
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:51,661
They need a leader.

546
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:58,923
Like you said, peace starts with me.

547
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:08,891
Got some R&R scheduled
in a few days down at Eagle Beach.

548
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:11,845
You CIA boys ever get time off,
maybe I'll see you down there.

549
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,309
Anything's possible.

550
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:18,272
You saved innocent lives. You saved me.

551
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,485
Pulled me back from crossing that line.

552
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:24,528
Well, I've been pulled back from
that line a couple of times myself.

553
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:31,406
Listen, uh, if that kid of yours

554
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:35,413
- happens to be a boy...
- Yeah?

555
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:39,288
Never mind.

556
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:49,762
Looks like
Operation Tough Love was a success.

557
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:59,604
Yeah. Figured you'd want this back.

558
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:03,066
I don't need it anymore.

559
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:21,960
<i>- Raymond, are you in there?</i>
- Yeah, I'm in here.

560
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:25,088
Just trying to rebuild
the Molecular Hyper Compressor.

561
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:28,254
You mean the shrink-ray
that I didn't get to use on Grodd.

562
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:30,431
Yes, it took quite a beating.

563
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:32,474
Uh... What are you doing here?

564
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:35,227
I came by to say that you were right.

565
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:39,648
Well, you and Nathaniel.
But I'd rather you didn't say anything.

566
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:44,730
No, of course not.
I won't say a word.

567
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:47,569
- About what exactly?
- Kuasa.

568
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:52,449
This experience with Grodd...
He wasn't born a monster.

569
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:53,871
He was made into one.

570
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:59,039
And for all I know,
the same is true with my granddaughter.

571
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,963
- So, thank you.
- Yeah, you're welcome.

572
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:07,947
<i>Well, I'm relieved you're all right.</i>

573
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:09,257
Got a little close back there.

574
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:12,181
By the way, you were right.

575
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:15,635
I was putting myself
under a lot of pressure to resolve

576
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:17,890
our separation problem.

577
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,264
I just wanted to make sure
I had done everything I could

578
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:21,644
to keep you safe before I left.

579
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:24,234
But you're gonna be just fine.

580
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:28,113
You already carry the most important
part of Firestorm within you,

581
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:30,942
his spirit.

582
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:33,865
You're getting all soft on me, Grey?

583
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:38,078
But, for real, I'm gonna miss you
when you're gone, man.

584
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,826
Anyway, you said
you had something to show me.

585
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,001
Oh, uh...

586
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:46,048
Yeah, so, after I saved L.B.J.'s life,

587
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:49,172
I thought I'd get a medal, or something.

588
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:53,051
But he just tells me he's got some
top secret information.

589
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,848
And hands me this.

590
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:05,898
Oh, dear God. This is incredible.

591
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:10,944
So, instead of a medal for bravery,
President Johnson gave you a pie recipe?

592
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:12,900
Well, not just any recipe.

593
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:16,112
Lady Bird Johnson's pecan pie
was legendary.

594
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:19,824
The ingredients were a very
closely-kept secret for a long time.

595
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:21,659
Man, it's almost
as good as my mama's pie.

596
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:24,621
I don't know.
First Lady pie is pretty good.

597
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:27,548
<i>This is a great gift.</i>

598
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:29,751
Way better than a medal.
'Cause you can eat it.

599
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,301
Whoa!

600
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:36,053
What? You guys weren't gonna
save me any pie?

601
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:42,225
Welcome back
to the land of the living, Captain.

602
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:45,057
Gideon gave me
a clean bill of health.

603
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:49,653
Hello, love. But I don't know
about this bump on my head?

604
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:53,816
- Who's the new guy?
- Oh, don't ask.

605
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:57,281
This was quite an adventure.
Where to next?

606
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,821
Shut up, you fop.

607
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:09,001
Ah... Vietnam.

608
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:11,295
Crappy war. Bitchin' music.

609
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:14,379
<i>Where is Grodd? Who are you?</i>

610
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:19,008
Is that any way to treat
your number one fan?

611
00:41:19,102 --> 00:41:22,220
Nuclear crisis in Central City?
Masterful.

612
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:24,472
<i>Why else do you think
I'd pull you out of Vietnam</i>

613
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:27,023
before you fell into
that napalm inferno?

00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,643
<i>Send me back.</i>

615
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:32,229
I know you wanted a timeship.

616
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,277
But who needs a lumbering tin-can

617
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:36,984
when you can time travel
with a single thought?
