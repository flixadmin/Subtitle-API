1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,440
<i>Previously on</i>
Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,696
You and I dating would be totally weird.

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:05,720
Totally weird.

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,837
Hank is running some secret project.

5
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:08,956
<i>A man came to me.</i>

6
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:09,960
<i>Neron.</i>

7
00:00:09,961 --> 00:00:10,920
<i>He offered me a deal.</i>

8
00:00:10,921 --> 00:00:12,673
Don't tell me
you're having second thoughts.

9
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,114
I have a new partner now. My son.

10
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,240
<i>I don't need you anymore.</i>

11
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,237
<i>I don't need you anymore, either.</i>

12
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,640
Dad?

13
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,200
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,114
I didn't kill Nate's dad.

15
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,440
Sara, you're asking me
to risk everything.

16
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,915
For some conspiracy theory?
For a bunch of monsters?

17
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,434
- Ava, don't do this.
- I'm done.

18
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,831
<i>Ava and I didn'tjust get into
an argument. She asked me to leave.</i>

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,199
Come on, Ava. Open up.

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,595
Look, I miss you.

21
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,671
I'm sorry things went down
the way they did,

22
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,958
but please, just open the door.

23
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,394
You know, technically,

24
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,392
this is still our apartment.

25
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,399
Ava.

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,400
Have a safe return.

27
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,677
Nora, what are you doing here?

28
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,910
Uh, I can explain.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,152
I can explain. I didn't kill Hank.
It was a demon.

30
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,320
Yeah, I know.

31
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,552
His name is Neron, and he's wearing
Desmond as a bleeding suit.

32
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,791
- Ray.
- Sara, great news!

33
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,996
Hank was killed by a demon.

34
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,276
"Great" was not the word
he was looking for.

35
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,477
- Poor Nate.
- Look, Ava's missing.

36
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,029
- Missing?
- I should've checked on her sooner.

37
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,856
It's Neron. He has his sights set on
the Time Bureau and the creatures.

38
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,191
And if he got to Hank,
then ding dongs to donuts, Ava was next.

39
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,555
She is not dead.

40
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,475
Listen, when Neron was at the Bureau,
he and I shared a connection.

41
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,256
If you can take me to Ava's place, I
might be able to know where he took her.

42
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,600
Demons communicate.

43
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,797
He'll know your past,
how susceptible you are.

44
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,030
You're a liability.

45
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,914
She's not a liability, she's a survivor.

46
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,152
Unlike you, she's turned her dark
experiences into a source of strength.

47
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,233
Not an excuse
for alcoholism or chain-smoking.

48
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,640
She also saved your life.

49
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,440
- Sorry. Would you like to add anything?
- No. That about covers it.

50
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,955
I don't care if she's a liability.

51
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,034
If Neron has Ava, then I need all
the magical firepower that we've got.

52
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,589
You two, with me. Woman the ship.

53
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,719
This is from two weeks ago.

54
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,554
Oh.

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,993
She's been gone a tick. That's not good.

56
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,314
Yeah. Thanks.

57
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,876
There.

58
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,600
What? What do you see?

59
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,991
He had her... here.

60
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,399
- Ava.
- That doesn't mean she's dead.

61
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,592
Doesn't mean she's alive, either.

62
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,760
I know where she is.

63
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,354
Conspiracies, embezzling, paper trails.

64
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,072
I feel like Julia Roberts
in <i>Erin Brockovich.</i>

65
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,277
We're more Pacific Gas and Electric,
Gary.

66
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,154
Wait. We're the bad guys?

67
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,576
I don't know who we are, Gary.
All right?

68
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,876
We're the guys trying to keep
my dad's cracked-out idea

69
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,998
of Jur-magic Park
from tanking the Time Bureau.

70
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,074
All right? So, anything that has to do
with Heyworld, get rid of it!

71
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,096
How am I gonna explain all this
to Director Sharpe?

72
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,634
Actually, Ava's missing.

73
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,400
I knew it.

74
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,109
I knew it! You know,

75
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,960
I had a dream about her
where she was driving

76
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,336
and I was in a car seat in the back.

77
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,760
- We were headed to Schul...
- Gary.

78
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,111
She needs me.
I can't... I gotta...

79
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,637
Sara, Constantine and Nora
are looking for her.

80
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,720
Nora?

81
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,752
- Look, she didn't kill Hank.
- Come on, man.

82
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,035
Just listen, okay?

83
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,000
Your dad made a deal
with a demon named Neron.

84
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,835
I guess something went wrong,
and the demon killed him.

85
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,276
I'm sorry, buddy.

86
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,000
My dad made a deal with a demon
to open a theme park.

87
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,713
Oh, Ray. I don't know
how much more of this I can take, man.

88
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,432
- Is that you?
- No.

89
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,956
If this is my dad's mistress,
I'm gonna jump out a window.

90
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,675
- Hello?
<i>- Yo, Mr. H. It's Mikey T.</i>

91
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,400
<i>Listen. Got a question for you
about the dragon lair.</i>

92
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,153
<i>I could sure use your eyes down here.</i>

93
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,240
- Down where?
<i>- What? Here, at the site.</i>

94
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,159
- Uh, Buckwood Downs?
<i>- Uh, yeah. Where else?</i>

95
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,356
Talk to you later.

96
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,476
Who was it?

97
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,576
I don't know. He sounded like a Soprano.

98
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,832
But apparently, my dad started
building this theme park.

99
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,353
The guys who were working with him.

100
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,514
Maybe they know something about
this Neron, and why he killed my dad.

101
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,116
Come on!

102
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,837
I'm Steel, you're The Atom.
There's nothing we cannot handle.

103
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,310
This one.

104
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,996
Ava!

105
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,270
Hey. Ava!

106
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,036
She's alive!

107
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,639
- What did he do to her?
- He's preparing her.

108
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,917
Neron must be looking for a new vessel.

109
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,480
It only makes sense, going after Ava,

110
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,791
especially if he wants control
over the Time Bureau.

111
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,078
And when a demon possesses someone,
the body has to be willing.

112
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,391
And if it's not,
the demon has to force his way in

113
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,949
by sending the soul to purgatory.

114
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,713
That's where the real fight begins.

115
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,990
How do we save her?

116
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,039
Some souls go up, and some go down.

117
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,874
But if she's been there
as long as she has,

118
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,792
then she's not coming back, Sara.

119
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,920
I'm not giving up on her, John.

120
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,310
You're gonna send me to purgatory
to get her.

121
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,696
If I send you down there with her,

122
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,176
there's nothing that I can do
to protect you.

123
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,160
I'll take my chances.

124
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:21,577
This isn't something that you can just
fight your way through, love.

125
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,954
John, please!

126
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,590
Fine.

127
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,389
Lay down.

128
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:43,552
Our purgatory is designed
to drive the soul to breaking point.

129
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,394
It's tailored to drive the captive mad.

130
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,679
Now, where you're going,
that's Ava's personal nightmare.

131
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,912
I've died, lost my soul,
and escaped a demon realm.

132
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,959
I'm pretty sure
I can handle Ava's purgatory.

133
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,632
Well, prepare for the worst, Sara Lance.

134
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,720
Welcome.

135
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,673
Do you need a bag?

136
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,071
I gotta get out of here.

137
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,437
I can't do this anymore.
I just gotta get out of here.

138
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,473
Ava!

139
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,716
Hey. Hey.

140
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,877
- Oh, thank God!
- Oh, my God!

141
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,800
Sara, is that really you?

142
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,394
It's me. I got you.

143
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,437
What the hell happened? Am I dead?

144
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,039
You were kidnapped by a demon.

145
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,473
And he's trying to take over your body,
so he trapped your soul here,

146
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,279
in your own personal purgatory.

147
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,036
But, Ava, if you check out, you die!

148
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,679
That's kind of on the nose, isn't it?

149
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,320
Wait. Does that mean he got you, too?

150
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,038
No! I'm taking you home.

151
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,629
I've got it! Natari!

152
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,997
I'm gonna regret asking this,
but what's that?

153
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,480
It's your couple's name!

154
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,156
Nat for "Nate,"
and of course, Ari is for you!

155
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,634
You know I'm a superhero, right?

156
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,679
With a flick of my wrist,
I can blast you with my wind powers.

157
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,275
Being honest,
wind powers, just not that scary.

158
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,990
Yeah. You're like a magical hairdryer.

159
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,151
What is this,
Legends Eye for the Straight Guy?

160
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,356
You're straight?

161
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,560
Where's Sara?

162
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,656
Uh, she's with Constantine and Nora,
trying to find Ava.

163
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,976
Actually, they've just returned

164
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,276
and Mr. Constantine has called
a team meeting in the lab.

165
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,158
- He can do that?
- No.

166
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,520
Let's go, dummies.

167
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,275
Ava's in hell?

168
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,798
She's not in hell.
Her soul is trapped in limbo.

169
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,678
And I am right there with her.

170
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,080
Oh, Gary.

171
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,038
Emotionally. Poor Director Sharpe.

172
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,191
I've sent Sara down there
to try and pull her out.

173
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,233
- I thought that they broke up.
- She still loves her.

174
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,438
- What can we do?
- Sara chose to go in after her, so...

175
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,592
Unless praying is your thing,
then the best thing you can do is wait.

176
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,955
You don't have to worry.

177
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,997
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

178
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,316
- He's on it.
- I'll take good care of her.

179
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,150
Them!

180
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,397
- All right. Charlie, you're with me.
- This should be interesting.

181
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,176
Let's go find out what this demon wants,
shall we?

182
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,395
- You're up for it?
- Mmm-hmm.

183
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,515
All right, then. Let's raise some hell.

184
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,992
Oh, how you doing? Can I help you guys?

185
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,838
Yeah. We're looking for Mr...

186
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,513
- Mr. T.
- Who's asking?

187
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,153
'Cause no one's allowed
on this site, unless...

188
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,310
Hey, I know you.

189
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,471
I'd recognize
that Heywood jawline anywhere.

190
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,519
You must be "& Son."

191
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,876
Are you kidding me?
Hank is always going on about you.

192
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,914
Where is he?

193
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,516
Hank passed.

194
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,480
What? Jeez. I'm sorry to hear that.

195
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,234
- You mind if we take a look around?
- Hey,

196
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,596
- it's all yours now, kid.
- Question.

197
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,038
Did my dad ever mention a man
by the name of Neron?

198
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,191
Neron? What is that, Greek?

199
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,000
No, it's demonic.
I mean, Danish, actually.

200
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,072
No. Never heard of the guy.

201
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,800
Actually, to be honest with you,
Hank didn't really tell me a lot.

202
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,793
All he gave me was this.

203
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,155
We're building that right now.

204
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,640
A unicorn rodeo.

205
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,554
Can you imagine? Two unicorns jousting.

206
00:10:49,601 --> 00:10:50,601
I'd rather not.

207
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,474
Hey. Come here, come here.

208
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,077
This... This is what
I was calling you guys about.

209
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,470
- About the...
- Dragon lair.

210
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,712
Yeah, I know. I drew it.

211
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,800
I drew all of this.

212
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,176
Great, tell me something. Look at this.

213
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,296
See this here? What is this?

214
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,233
Is this supposed to be real flame
or were you thinking, like, plexi?

215
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,880
'Cause I got a guy that can do fire,
like forget about it.

216
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,875
I can't believe he did it.

217
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,439
I know you and your dad struggled.

218
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,911
And even if you got your wires crossed,
you never stopped trying to connect.

219
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,591
- I just hope my dad knew I loved him.
- He knew.

220
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,594
Look at this place.

221
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,240
You know, I just wish
he would've found a better way

222
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,993
to tell me he loved me.

223
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,992
One that didn't involve
teaming up with a demon

224
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,833
and embezzling money
from the government.

225
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,435
It's a bit much.

226
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,036
Mikey T! Mikey T!

227
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,270
Change of plans.

228
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,110
Tear it down.

229
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,160
The dragon lair?

230
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,957
The whole thing.

231
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,959
Waiting sucks.

232
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,235
Ooh! Sexting Nate?

233
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,152
- Boundaries, Mona.
- I need vicarious feels.

234
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,336
There are more important things
to focus on right now.

235
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,319
And Nate's got a lot going on.
It's not the right time.

236
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,909
What are you typing?

237
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,515
"Hey, what's up?"

238
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,816
Wait, I don't even know
why I'm talking to you two about it.

239
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,320
You don't even date humans.

240
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,312
Love is love.

241
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,114
Whatever you need, I'm here.

242
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,800
Whatever you need, I'm here.

243
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,190
Why is Gary in your subconscious?

244
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,272
I may have some Gary issues
that need working out.

245
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,234
Okay, we just need to find the door
that you came in.

246
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,800
Does any of this look familiar?

247
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,673
No. It all looks exactly the same.

248
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,911
Why don't we just try to follow
the arrows back?

249
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,296
Maybe they'll take us to the entrance.

250
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,234
<i>Reminder, shoppers,
the store will be closing in one hour.</i>

251
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,976
Constantine didn't say
anything about that.

252
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
What does it mean?

253
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,199
It means we take shortcuts. Come on.

254
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,236
Hello again, ladies.

255
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,496
Damn it!

256
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,318
Okay. This way.

257
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,119
No. Or we could just ask Gary.

258
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,554
How do we get to the entrance?

259
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,360
Oh...

260
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,440
We're not really allowed
to give that kind of advice.

261
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,516
Come on.

262
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:36,238
But the ERGRIK wardrobe might be
just the thing you're looking for.

263
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,632
Looks like the wardrobe section.

264
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,120
No.

265
00:13:49,801 --> 00:13:51,393
Now what?

266
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,399
I think we're supposed
to put it together.

267
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,440
No sweat.

268
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,760
Here.

269
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,400
Wait, wait, wait.

270
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,915
Step one, insert the dowel.

271
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,514
- Here, babe.
- I got this.

272
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,480
Shut up, man.

273
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,830
You kidding me?
What are you, brain-damaged?

274
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,271
Papa's home.

275
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,270
Miss me? I missed you.

276
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,990
We'll be together soon, my pet.

277
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,240
Not bloody likely!

278
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,515
Oh, Nora.

279
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,400
There's nowhere for you to run now,
you bile bladder.

280
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,473
Me, run? You're the one who ran.

281
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,280
All I had to do was say,
"I'm coming for you, Johnny."

282
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,520
And you left 2018 to me.

283
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,317
It's delicious
how easily humans are corrupted.

284
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,834
Especially here in D.C.

285
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,118
So, that's your game?
You inflict fear and anger on humanity?

286
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,078
I merely fan the flames.

287
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,311
People are primed
to give into what they fear most.

288
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,360
You know what, man?

289
00:16:01,361 --> 00:16:04,478
I am gonna send your ass
straight back to hell.

290
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,190
- John, this isn't the plan.
- Nora, we finally get to talk.

291
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,358
Hope you've enjoyed
your little dalliances inside my mind.

292
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,776
<i>But it's not a one-way street.</i>

293
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,917
<i>Is it, Nora?</i>

294
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,276
I knew you were a liability.
We should be off with him.

295
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,936
You're playing right into his hands,
John.

296
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,440
You're the one who can't handle this.

297
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,554
Yes, says Miss Lock-herself-up-because-
she-can't-handle-her-own-demons.

298
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,314
This is me handling mine, all right?

299
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,034
Out!

300
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,080
He's getting to you.

301
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,097
- What, he's getting to me?
- Yeah.

302
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,554
He's inside your head.

303
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,434
What, you don't think
I haven't seen you struggling?

304
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,359
Humanity hasn't exactly been kind
to you, has it, Nora?

305
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,593
You're addicted to this kind of power,
and believe me, it doesn't go away.

306
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,433
No, it doesn't. And it hasn't been easy.

307
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,874
But if I can trust myself,

308
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,191
I don't think it's too much
to ask for you to try, too.

309
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,352
Oh, it's killing you
to look at his face.

310
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,160
I know how hard it is to watch
someone you love become a demon.

311
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,273
Yeah, too bad there aren't any Beebos
around to hug you to death!

312
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:16,876
We can't just keep him locked up
in there, driving us all mad.

313
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,520
Yeah. I think between the two of us,
we can figure something out.

314
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,756
Ta-da!

315
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,440
Damn it!

316
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,712
What a surprise, you followed none
of the instructions, and it didn't work.

317
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,235
I am sensing
that this isn't about the dresser.

318
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,834
No, this is what you always do.

319
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,136
Just bulldoze your way through.

320
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,600
- I do not always do this.
- Like lying to me about the Kaupe?

321
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,200
You were defending torturing creatures.

322
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,433
Defending? I wasn't defending it.
I was defending myself.

323
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,749
Of course I don't believe

324
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,936
that we should be intentionally hurting
anything or anyone,

325
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,873
but when we fight, Sara,
I get really scared.

326
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,792
And I just go to my corner.

327
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,880
Look, it's just fight or flight.
That couldn't be any more human.

328
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,155
I just really need to know
that you're on my team.

329
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,752
I am always on your team,
even when we disagree.

330
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,035
Now,

331
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,912
should we give it another go?

332
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,480
Thank you.

333
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,994
- Uh-huh?
- Uh-huh.

334
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,592
See? Following instructions
is not that bad.

335
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,394
- Oh, don't gloat.
- Let's get out of here.

336
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,550
Something's wrong.

337
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,872
- Did we miss a screw, or something?
- No.

338
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,395
We missed this.
How the hell did we possibly miss this?

339
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,480
Damn it.

340
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,594
Hey, look.
It's not perfect, but it's ours.

341
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,794
Can you live with that?

342
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:06,600
Hey, don't go in your corner.

343
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,559
Yeah, I can live with it.

344
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,076
Hell, yeah, let's go to Narnia.

345
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,000
Are we out?

346
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,231
Out of the closet,
but not the store.

347
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,320
Touché.

348
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,910
Welcome to our mattress showroom!
If you'll follow me...

349
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:33,273
The mattress you choose will be the most
important decision of your life.

350
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,837
Wait,
you're showing them the mattresses?

351
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,833
We need everyone out
before Tabitha gets here.

352
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,195
Who the hell is Tabitha?

353
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,478
You don't want to know Tabitha.
Best of luck in your mattress choice.

354
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,395
- Gary, don't...
- Wait. We need to...

355
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,336
This is starting to feel like
that escape room we did.

356
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,591
Okay, so, subconscious Gary said
that this would be

357
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,176
the most important choice of our life.
What do you think that means?

358
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,635
That even subconscious Gary
needs to get a life.

359
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,836
No, it's a puzzle.

360
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,071
What does it mean?
Do you think we need to...

361
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,720
It means we need to pick a mattress.

362
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,235
- How about this one?
- What?

363
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,877
Whoa! 600 bucks.

364
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,296
- That is...
- Three-year warranty?

365
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,256
- That's really...
- ...ridiculously expensive, right?

366
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,397
I was thinking, like, $250.

367
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,630
Are you kidding?
It would be saggy in like a year.

368
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,560
So, you just flip it over.

369
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,394
You just flip it over? Is that
what you do when things get saggy?

370
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,834
You just flip them over,

371
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,760
so you don't have to look
at their saggy faces?

372
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,116
Okay.

373
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,149
How about this one? Fifteen years.

374
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Well, that's better.

375
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,160
Oh.

376
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:46,993
When did you start going gray?

377
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,080
Whoa!

378
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,879
This place has been really stressful.

379
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,960
Yeah.

380
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,680
I think it's the mattress.

381
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,879
Apparently, your purgatory
is your anxieties.

382
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,995
One of which must be getting old.

383
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,157
I'm not worried about getting old, Sara.

384
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,757
I'm worried about getting old with you.

385
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:24,717
So, we're talking about marriage.

386
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,036
Wow.

387
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,834
You look... still really hot, but...

388
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,636
You, too.

389
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:47,440
Fifty years is a long time
sleeping on one mattress.

390
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,316
Sure is.

391
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,199
Look, I know it's a lot.

392
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,670
Fifty years with just one person.

393
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,916
It's not the one person thing, I just...

394
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,438
Look, I've never really thought
that much past tomorrow.

395
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:08,673
Ava, with my past,
planning anything for the future

396
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,878
is just... Feels like tempting fate.

397
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,272
And I convinced myself
that I like it that way.

398
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,479
Until you came along.

399
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,236
You just freaking came to purgatory
for me.

400
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,192
How's that for giving
a middle finger to fate?

401
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,397
Look, you're allowed to want things
sometimes, Sara.

402
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:35,072
But what if I can't be
the person that you need?

403
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:40,070
Let's be honest,
neither of us needs anybody, right?

404
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,917
But you are who I want.

405
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,518
I bet you there's some
good liquor in Ava's office.

406
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,394
I mean, my dad's old office.

407
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,712
Oh, man. Things are bleak.

408
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,357
Hey, Ray.
Thanks for sticking around here.

409
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,999
Yeah, buddy, of course.
That's what friends are for.

410
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,879
I just wish I wasn't such an idiot
at my dad's funeral.

411
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,475
I had a chance to talk to him,
but I blew it.

412
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,320
But now I'll never know what happened.

413
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,216
Well, maybe Constantine
can get you some answers.

414
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,256
Looks like they caught Neron.

415
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,634
Son of a bitch!

416
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,560
Is that the demon who killed my dad?

417
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,030
Whoa, there, squire.
You take it easy, all right?

418
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,216
Nate, you don't want to
go in there. Just walk away.

419
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,435
- No, not a chance.
- Nate!

420
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,512
Wait! Wait!

421
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:41,920
Hello, Nathaniel.
I've heard so much about you.

422
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,909
So predictable. The son who, in life,
could never connect with the father,

423
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,356
here now, seeking the truth.

424
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,159
Well, here it is.

425
00:23:55,280 --> 00:24:00,674
Hank was an unfortunate snag in my plan.
So, I...

426
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,996
- You evil bastard.
- Yeah.

427
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,680
Demon.

428
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,680
Nate's already angry,
makes him prime pickings for Neron.

429
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:16,436
He'll be all right, as long as
he doesn't cross that bloody barrier.

430
00:24:17,441 --> 00:24:20,639
Why? He built your theme park
just like you wanted.

431
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,871
You think I wanted a theme park?

432
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,795
I gave Hank power, and in return,
he was to supply me

433
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,156
with fear-mongering magical creatures

434
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,830
to terrorize people
into giving up their souls.

435
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,835
Instead, he went behind my back
and built some deranged zoo.

436
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:40,118
He betrayed me. Because of you.

437
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,634
No...

438
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,797
If you'd have just stayed
out of our way,

439
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,999
maybe your old man would still be alive.

440
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,640
- Nate! No!
- Don't push...

441
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,110
Ray, I'm sorry.

442
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,431
- I'm sorry about...
- It's okay, buddy.

443
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,392
I know it wasn't you.

444
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,400
Oh.

445
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,680
What are...

446
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,674
It's locked.

447
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,879
- Uh... There's nothing to build.
- No furniture to choose.

448
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,996
Dishes.

449
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,355
Piece of cake. Go, go, go.

450
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:36,559
You know, this seems more like
one of your fantasies than your fears,

451
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,796
watching me do dishes.

452
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,793
Please, if it were up to you,
we would only have paper plates. Here.

453
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,000
- You on that?
- Got it.

454
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,716
I'm on it.

455
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,356
It never ends.

456
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,756
Did you send it?

457
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,753
Honestly, mate, whatever happened
to just talking to someone?

458
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,476
Emojis are way more fun
and if he's not that into it,

459
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,880
you can pretend like
you were talking about something else.

460
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,271
Right. Nate's going to think I was dying
to tell him about a dancing lady

461
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,437
carrying a burning eggplant.

462
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,517
Here. Use words.
It's erotic, but vulnerable.

463
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,399
Okay, let me see it.

464
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,272
I'm not saying "bulge."

465
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,479
Sula the Wolf Witch talked about
smothering a demon.

466
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,358
Does that make sense to you?

467
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,875
When Mallus was a part of me,
I could feel his fear.

468
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,038
Like he was vulnerable here on Earth.

469
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,276
It made him nervous.

470
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:56,149
So, if we can separate the demon
from his earthly vessel,

471
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,517
it will suffocate him,
just like a fish out of water.

472
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,672
<i>Why are you
even working with that arrogant dick?</i>

473
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,759
<i>He'll never value your true power.</i>

474
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,672
<i>Not like I will...</i>

475
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,952
- You all right there, love?
- Yeah.

476
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,475
I just need some coffee. I'm fine.

477
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,793
And I'm sober.

478
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,678
Hey, are you okay?

479
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,194
I'm all right. Thanks.

480
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,198
You best let her alone, squire.

481
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,717
This is all your mail! You deal with it.

482
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,800
It's not like you have an address
to even get mail, so...

483
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,912
We both talked about it and agreed

484
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,834
that now wasn't the right time
for me to move in with you.

485
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,912
- But we're making it work.
- Are we?

486
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,710
Because how I see it, we're living
completely separate lives. So...

487
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,713
Ava, I want this.
Just when the time is right.

488
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,634
Timing doesn't just happen, Sara, okay?
You have to make a choice.

489
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,679
So, what?
What, this? This is what you want?

490
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,834
No. Of course, nobody just wants
dirty dishes, but, yes.

491
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,555
Ava, we're time-traveling superheroes.

492
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,791
Okay, fine. But I am not just my job.

493
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,317
I want some hobbies,
I want a life with you.

494
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,110
And sometimes, life is just this.

495
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,600
Okay? It's boring.

496
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,876
What then?
You off to the next adventure?

497
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,360
No. But I can't just decide

498
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,717
every single moment of forever,
right this instant.

499
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:31,352
So, please, just tell me what
you want me to say, and I'll say it,

500
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,472
and we can get out of here.

501
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:37,272
I can't tell you what to say, Sara,
because then it wouldn't mean anything.

502
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,559
Okay. Well...

503
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:47,355
Let's just move to the suburbs
and we'll just recycle until we die.

504
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,880
Can we go now?

505
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,032
Oh, no.

506
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,270
It's just me. Let's talk.

507
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:43,990
I've admired your... power
for a long time, Nora.

508
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,232
I don't take compliments from people
who frame me for murder.

509
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:50,518
All in the interest
of self-preservation. You understand.

510
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,479
Do they even know
what you're capable of?

511
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,040
They have no idea.

512
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,555
Then why waste your time
with that arrogant bastard

513
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:02,515
and his pathetic delusion
that the world needs him to save it.

514
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,313
When I met John, I was just a kid.

515
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,315
<i>He was kind.</i>

516
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,915
Mallus wanted me, but I wasn't ready.

517
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,200
But I'll tell you this,
John did everything he could to save me.

518
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,196
But when he failed, he abandoned me.

519
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:32,638
John knew what the Order were doing
to me, and he just let them.

520
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,316
And he's the one who decides
who to send to hell.

521
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:41,276
Cocky cowboy, wearing his hangover
like a 10-gallon hat.

522
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,997
He might have won that last battle,
but the war is mine.

523
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,437
My Tabitha will be free soon,

524
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,558
and when she is,
we're gonna put John away for good.

525
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,640
Tabitha?

526
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,559
That's why you needed Ava as a vessel.

527
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,709
There's a model for everyone.

528
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,319
Are you looking for one to clean,
one to keep you safe, one to...

529
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,993
please you?

530
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,197
No, you creep.

531
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,670
I'm looking for Ava.

532
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,912
- They're all Ava.
- No. They're not.

533
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:26,593
Just remember, pick quickly.

534
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,350
Tabitha will be here soon,
and once she's here...

535
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:34,641
Oh, no.

536
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,032
Once she's here, what?

537
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:44,310
<i>Attention. The store
will be closing in five minutes.</i>

538
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,311
I can't believe I got my dad killed.

539
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,915
No. It was Hank's choice
to make a deal with a demon,

540
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,593
that is not your fault.

541
00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:01,960
You spending time with him
inspired him, made him happy.

542
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:06,070
I don't think you doomed him.
I think you saved him.

543
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:15,836
Here's to the man
you helped your dad become.

544
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,710
You know what, Ray?

545
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,793
You're right. I shouldn't
be embarrassed, I should be proud.

546
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,036
Yeah, my dad was a little wacky,
but most of the good ones are.

547
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,477
He was a legend,
and he should be remembered that way.

548
00:32:33,161 --> 00:32:36,757
Mikey T. I gotta stop him.

549
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,116
Sara will never let you take Ava.

550
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,635
If not her, I'll find someone else.

551
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:51,354
You know, I can bring back other people.

552
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,909
Damien misses you so much.

553
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:01,597
- You can bring my father...
- Of course.

554
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:05,720
Now, be a lamb and let me out,
Nora Darhk.

555
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,716
You know,
you can't just walk out of here.

556
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,954
Constantine will never let you do that.

557
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,035
Maybe as Desmond.

558
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,237
But if you let me in,

559
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,431
you, with my power,

560
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,319
nobody could stop us.

561
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:27,193
The monitors were wonky,
are you all right?

562
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,959
Of course, you shut them down.
I should have never trusted you.

563
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,035
Shut up, John.

564
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:50,274
<i>Attention, the store
will be closing in two minutes.</i>

565
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,519
Where is she?

566
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,120
None of these are Ava!

567
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,759
I'm not leaving without her.

568
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,874
Ava.

569
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,631
But you could've chosen
any one of those other women.

570
00:34:28,681 --> 00:34:30,399
I don't want other women.

571
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,350
But I'm...

572
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,878
- Hey. Hey.
- Oh.

573
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,160
You did it.

574
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,197
No. We did it.

575
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,029
We did it!

576
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,710
Let's do this.

577
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,476
Nora?

578
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,680
Now!

579
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:43,349
"Vessel."
What a pretty word for "victim."

580
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,116
Oh, I don't need your power, Neron.

581
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,553
I have my own.

582
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,394
We've got him. Just a few minutes more.

583
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,720
Nora!

584
00:35:53,721 --> 00:35:54,721
Ray, no!

585
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,430
Des, Des? Des. Des, hey, hey, hey.
It's okay, mate.

586
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,749
It's all right.

587
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,869
- Where am I?
- Safe.

588
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,520
Nora?

589
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,599
Nora.

590
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,074
Eggplant's a little obvious.
I say you go with mushroom.

591
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,953
Mushroom...

592
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,680
Ava! You're back from the dead!

593
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,194
- Gently.
- Do it gently.

594
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,200
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

595
00:36:49,201 --> 00:36:51,237
Nice job, boss.

596
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:55,075
- Okay, serious. Which emoji is like...
- All right. Enough with the emojis.

597
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,279
Just leave while you can.

598
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,754
- You should just...
- Let's go.

599
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,136
- Okay.
- Maybe...

600
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,720
We should probably talk
about whether or not we want kids.

601
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,191
Let's wait until the other eight
are old enough to handle the news.

602
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,351
I don't even know
what this text means anymore.

603
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,750
"You up? Hot dog, donut, thumbs up."

604
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,274
Well, you wanna snog him, yeah?

605
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,311
Or do you want him to get diabetes?

606
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,837
Okay, this doesn't sound like me at all.

607
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,075
You like him and he likes you.
Just tell him that.

608
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,880
Okay.

609
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,793
"Want to go out sometime..."

610
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,514
"...on a date?"

611
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,799
Yeah, see? That wasn't so bad.

612
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,599
Now, it's all on Nate.

613
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,757
Oh, God. Oh, God, what did I do?

614
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,280
Give me a hand with that.

615
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,119
Mikey, pick up. Mikey, pick up.

616
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,238
You can just drop that down.
You're not gonna need it.

617
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,920
No.

618
00:38:11,921 --> 00:38:15,597
Mikey! No! Mikey!

619
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,353
Mikey, stop!

620
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,080
Zari?

621
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,192
Is that you, "& Son"?

622
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,513
I changed my mind!

623
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,516
What are you doing?
You should've just called.

624
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,710
I knew I should have synced
to the stupid cloud.

625
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,880
Nate.

626
00:38:52,881 --> 00:38:54,314
- Hey.
- Hi. Uh...

627
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,032
So, about...
About that text...

628
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:03,911
Yeah, my phone had an unfortunate run-in
with a wrecking ball, so...

629
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,469
Oh, my God. That sucks.

630
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,040
What did you wanna talk about?

631
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,677
I just wanted to let you
know that Sara and Ava, they're good.

632
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,320
- That's great!
- Yeah.

633
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,234
Anything else you wanna talk about?

634
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,679
No. No, not that I can think of.

635
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,956
Okay. Cool, cool, cool.

636
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,438
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

637
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,477
- Zari.
- Bye.

638
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,559
Hello?

639
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,200
Is there anyone here
who can call me a cab?

640
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,350
Anything you need, mate.

641
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,871
I can get you a flight to New Orleans,
anywhere in the world. You name it.

642
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:47,155
No. I don't want anything from you.

643
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,791
I'm not asking you for forgiveness, Des.

644
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,556
- Good.
- Just wait.

645
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:02,039
You saved me, Johnny.
I'm grateful for that.

646
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,271
But it doesn't change anything.

647
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,793
I know.

648
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,911
You know, I can make it all go away,
Des. This'll make you forget.

649
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,716
No.

650
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:20,471
You sent me to hell.

651
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,829
That's something
we're both gonna have to live with.

652
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,197
How's she holding up, old son?

653
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,954
She's stable, but unresponsive.

654
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,832
Well, that's better
than the alternative.

655
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,559
I couldn't let her get hurt again.

656
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,155
Yeah, right,
you just rode straight in there,

657
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,916
like a knight in shinin' armor
and nearly got her killed.

658
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,270
I didn't mean to.

659
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,199
Yeah, I know.

660
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,556
She's a brave lass.

661
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,996
Nearly cost her her life.

662
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,520
She killed that bloody demon.

663
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,599
She's amazing.

664
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,191
We'll get you out of this one, Nora.

665
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,791
I'm not gonna abandon you again.

666
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,549
It's okay, boy! Dogs usually love me!
