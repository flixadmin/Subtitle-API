1
00:00:26,641 --> 00:00:28,518
These people.

2
00:00:29,102 --> 00:00:30,103
Pathetic.

3
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:34,274
I already read that one anyway.

4
00:00:34,482 --> 00:00:36,442
Kleinman has better magazines.

5
00:00:36,651 --> 00:00:39,862
You know, you guys
really don't need to hang around.

6
00:00:40,071 --> 00:00:42,490
We won't even get the results
till next week.

7
00:00:42,699 --> 00:00:45,285
Buddy, we're gonna be here.
You kidding me?

8
00:00:45,493 --> 00:00:48,204
<i>It is a full PETICT, correct?</i>

9
00:00:48,413 --> 00:00:52,500
<i>You definitely want the PETICT
and not just the PET.</i>

10
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:56,170
<i>Yeah, it's a PETICT.</i>

11
00:00:56,379 --> 00:00:58,840
Good. That's what you want.

12
00:00:59,048 --> 00:01:02,385
Some places skimp
and they only do the PET.

13
00:01:03,136 --> 00:01:05,430
I'm not naming any names.

14
00:01:06,598 --> 00:01:09,684
I just still don't understand
why you don't go to Kleinman.

15
00:01:09,893 --> 00:01:11,561
This is where Walt's doctor is.

16
00:01:11,769 --> 00:01:14,439
Well, with us, you wouldn't
have to wait until next week...

17
00:01:14,647 --> 00:01:16,399
...to get the results.

18
00:01:16,608 --> 00:01:19,569
I'm sorry, but these scans
are not that difficult to read.

19
00:01:19,777 --> 00:01:21,362
I could take one look at Walt's...

20
00:01:21,779 --> 00:01:23,907
...and tell you immediately
how he's doing.

21
00:01:24,115 --> 00:01:26,910
-Really.
-Doctors like people to think...

22
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:30,580
...that they're so much smarter
than the technicians...

23
00:01:30,788 --> 00:01:34,918
...but you would be surprised
how much they come to us for input.

24
00:01:38,379 --> 00:01:42,425
Well, never turn down a chance
to hit the bathroom, huh?

25
00:01:43,051 --> 00:01:44,677
Excuse me.

26
00:01:56,105 --> 00:01:57,815
You all right in there?

27
00:01:59,442 --> 00:02:00,860
Yeah.

28
00:02:04,614 --> 00:02:06,241
Hey, you okay?

29
00:02:06,449 --> 00:02:07,951
Yes.

30
00:02:10,328 --> 00:02:12,372
I'm fine, thank you.

31
00:02:36,646 --> 00:02:39,732
Sir, you can go back to your
changing room and get dressed.

32
00:02:39,941 --> 00:02:44,988
-So how'd we do?
-You did fine.

33
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,326
-See anything?
-I'm just a technician, Mr. White.

34
00:02:50,535 --> 00:02:53,371
Dr. Delcavoli will go over the results
with you next week.

35
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,998
Sorry.

36
00:03:33,244 --> 00:03:36,831
Actually, the money-laundering aspect
is fairly straightforward.

37
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,627
But I gotta tell you,
the not-telling-your-wife aspect?

38
00:03:40,835 --> 00:03:43,504
Most people wanna know
why they suddenly got rich.

39
00:03:43,713 --> 00:03:47,675
If she finds out, it's after I'm gone.

40
00:03:47,884 --> 00:03:49,886
How much time they giving you?

41
00:03:50,845 --> 00:03:52,430
Weeks.

42
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:54,224
Maybe.

43
00:03:54,432 --> 00:03:55,892
Sorry to hear it.

44
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,729
I was hoping we could
make some real money together.

45
00:04:00,438 --> 00:04:02,732
Oh, well.
Look, let's crunch some numbers.

46
00:04:02,941 --> 00:04:05,652
How much money
are we laundering?

47
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:09,989
At this time, $16,000.

48
00:04:11,991 --> 00:04:13,409
How long you been doing this?

49
00:04:14,494 --> 00:04:16,913
We've had some
extenuating circumstances.

50
00:04:17,121 --> 00:04:18,581
Yeah, apparently.

51
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:24,128
All right, 16,000 laundered
at 75 cents on the dollar...

52
00:04:24,337 --> 00:04:27,882
...minus my fee,
which is 17 percent...

53
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:31,261
...comes to $9960.

54
00:04:31,469 --> 00:04:35,098
Congratulations, you just left
your family a secondhand Subaru.

55
00:04:35,306 --> 00:04:38,851
Well, we'll just have to cook more.
A lot more.

56
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,437
Yeah, that's my legal opinion.

57
00:04:41,646 --> 00:04:44,899
Make hay
while the sun is still shining.

58
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:54,200
You know, we should do something
this weekend.

59
00:04:54,409 --> 00:04:57,704
You know,
get our minds off the test results.

60
00:05:00,498 --> 00:05:02,417
Actually, I....

61
00:05:05,295 --> 00:05:08,089
I'm thinking I should go see Mom.

62
00:05:13,344 --> 00:05:15,263
-Really?
-Yeah.

63
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:18,892
You know, I never did call her.

64
00:05:21,352 --> 00:05:26,065
You're expecting the news
from the scan to be bad.

65
00:05:31,112 --> 00:05:32,822
God, Walt.

66
00:05:33,573 --> 00:05:36,910
I need you to stay positive
with me here.

67
00:05:37,118 --> 00:05:40,496
I am. Positive is good.

68
00:05:40,705 --> 00:05:41,915
I'm all for positive...

69
00:05:42,123 --> 00:05:46,586
...but positive doesn't change facts,
all right?

70
00:05:46,794 --> 00:05:48,171
It....

71
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:51,257
It doesn't change the need
to be prepared.

72
00:05:51,466 --> 00:05:52,842
I know.

73
00:05:53,051 --> 00:05:56,429
Walt, I'm just trying
to be hopeful, okay?

74
00:05:56,638 --> 00:05:58,723
You know, forgive me.

75
00:06:01,476 --> 00:06:03,061
Look...

76
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:06,189
...I need to know Mom's
going to leave you something if--

77
00:06:06,397 --> 00:06:07,982
If...

78
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,193
...I'm no longer around.

79
00:06:11,528 --> 00:06:14,656
I just need to get that straight,
that's all.

80
00:06:17,492 --> 00:06:21,204
And believe me,
I'm gonna earn every penny of it too.

81
00:06:22,705 --> 00:06:26,334
Complaining about her nurses
the entire time.

82
00:06:27,085 --> 00:06:31,297
"Juanita is hiding my ashtray."

83
00:06:32,715 --> 00:06:36,052
A 30-minute discourse...

84
00:06:36,261 --> 00:06:39,722
...about how the sugar packets
are suddenly disappearing.

85
00:06:39,931 --> 00:06:43,226
And, oh, she's counting
every one of them, you know.

86
00:06:46,437 --> 00:06:49,732
I'll be lucky
if I get a word in edgewise.

87
00:07:04,873 --> 00:07:08,543
I actually think the news from the scan
is gonna be good.

88
00:07:10,169 --> 00:07:13,089
Perhaps you should prepare for that.

89
00:07:14,924 --> 00:07:16,384
Yeah.

90
00:07:25,226 --> 00:07:29,439
-We should do something.
-Yeah, we should.

91
00:07:29,647 --> 00:07:32,108
No, something else.

92
00:07:33,026 --> 00:07:35,111
We should go somewhere.

93
00:07:36,112 --> 00:07:38,114
Have you been
to the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum?

94
00:07:38,323 --> 00:07:40,450
Is that the one with the A-bombs?

95
00:07:42,994 --> 00:07:45,205
Georgia O'Keeffe.

96
00:07:45,413 --> 00:07:47,332
She's a painter.

97
00:07:47,999 --> 00:07:49,918
You've never heard
of Georgia O'Keeffe?

98
00:07:50,126 --> 00:07:52,003
No, is that bad?

99
00:07:52,212 --> 00:07:56,966
-Boy, you need some educating.
-Yes, yes, I do. Come here.

100
00:07:57,175 --> 00:08:00,303
Why don't we go up to Santa Fe?
We'll make a day of it.

101
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:04,098
You wanna go all the way to Santa Fe
for a museum?

102
00:08:04,307 --> 00:08:06,893
So romantic.

103
00:08:07,101 --> 00:08:09,771
Yup, we're going. Get up.

104
00:08:10,563 --> 00:08:14,817
Why can't we just go to the movies
or putt-putt?

105
00:08:15,026 --> 00:08:17,320
It's the shit.

106
00:08:17,737 --> 00:08:19,614
A little culture won't kill you.

107
00:08:19,822 --> 00:08:23,409
Besides, you might like it.
A lot of her paintings look like vaginas.

108
00:08:24,827 --> 00:08:25,912
Really?

109
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:32,252
-Is there still cereal?
-Yeah.

110
00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:42,387
<i>Yo, if I know you, leave a message.</i>

111
00:08:42,595 --> 00:08:45,348
<i>Where the hell are you?
Pick up the phone.</i>

112
00:08:45,557 --> 00:08:48,768
<i>-Hello? Jesse, pick up--
-Hold on, hold on.</i>

113
00:08:48,977 --> 00:08:51,020
Sorry, one sec.

114
00:08:56,192 --> 00:08:58,778
<i>-What?
-I've been trying to reach you.</i>

115
00:08:58,987 --> 00:09:00,154
Where's your drop phone?

116
00:09:02,407 --> 00:09:04,951
<i>-I've been busy.
-Well, clear your social calendar.</i>

117
00:09:06,452 --> 00:09:08,705
<i>-We have to cook.
-What? Today?</i>

118
00:09:08,913 --> 00:09:11,332
<i>No, you'll need today at least
to gather supplies.</i>

119
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,793
<i>Now, we're going to need
all new glassware...</i>

120
00:09:14,002 --> 00:09:16,504
...heating mantles,
about a hundred pounds of ice.

121
00:09:16,713 --> 00:09:19,591
Do you have a paper and pencil?
You should be writing this down.

122
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:22,760
You wanna go shopping,
go do it yourself, all right? I got plans.

123
00:09:22,969 --> 00:09:25,722
<i>Smoking marijuana,
eating Cheetos and masturbating...</i>

124
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:28,433
...do not constitute plans
in my book.

125
00:09:28,641 --> 00:09:30,727
<i>Well, screw you and your book, man,
all right?</i>

126
00:09:30,935 --> 00:09:33,897
I'm going to a museum in Santa Fe,
not like you need to know.

127
00:09:34,105 --> 00:09:38,318
-You're going to a museum, huh?
-Yeah. Georgia O'Keeffe.

128
00:09:38,526 --> 00:09:41,571
<i>-Georgia O'Keeffe?
-She's a painter, duh.</i>

129
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:43,239
She does these vagina pictures.

130
00:09:43,448 --> 00:09:46,576
Or paintings, or just painted.
I don't know.

131
00:09:46,784 --> 00:09:48,203
What are you even talking about?

132
00:09:48,411 --> 00:09:51,581
Look, man, why am I even
explaining myself to you, all right?

133
00:09:51,789 --> 00:09:53,875
It's none of your damn business
what I'm doing.

134
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:57,420
All you need to know is I ain't cooking
or shopping or whatever the hell.

135
00:09:57,629 --> 00:09:59,088
Let me explain something to you.

136
00:09:59,297 --> 00:10:02,342
You and I need to cook
through to next Tuesday.

137
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:06,763
-Tuesday? Four days straight?
-Like it or not, we have no choice.

138
00:10:06,971 --> 00:10:10,266
<i>Yeah? And why exactly is that?</i>

139
00:10:12,227 --> 00:10:14,437
Our methylamine. It's going bad.

140
00:10:14,646 --> 00:10:16,898
<i>-What?
-It's losing its chemical potency.</i>

141
00:10:17,106 --> 00:10:20,235
Now, unless stealing another barrel
sounds good to you....

142
00:10:20,443 --> 00:10:21,736
<i>Hell, no.</i>

143
00:10:21,945 --> 00:10:24,572
All right, we have to act fast,
before it goes to waste.

144
00:10:24,781 --> 00:10:26,991
<i>You have a paper and pencil?</i>

145
00:10:28,409 --> 00:10:32,288
<i>-Come on.
-All right, all right. Go.</i>

146
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:35,375
Okay, six mantles. Mantle? Mantle?

147
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,794
What do you mean, mantle?
You mean like Mickey?

148
00:10:38,002 --> 00:10:40,046
I really wish
you didn't have to do this.

149
00:10:40,838 --> 00:10:42,674
Me too.

150
00:10:42,882 --> 00:10:44,634
But I'll be back before you know it...

151
00:10:44,842 --> 00:10:47,554
...and you can always call
if you need me.

152
00:10:47,762 --> 00:10:52,350
What, and risk talking to your mother?
Have to be some emergency.

153
00:11:02,861 --> 00:11:04,279
Love you.

154
00:11:06,447 --> 00:11:09,117
-Fly safe, okay?
-Okay.

155
00:11:32,056 --> 00:11:34,642
<i>The white zone is for immediate
loading and unloading...</i>

156
00:11:34,851 --> 00:11:36,227
<i>...of passengers only.</i>

157
00:11:36,436 --> 00:11:38,313
<i>No parking.</i>

158
00:11:46,696 --> 00:11:49,699
<i>Attention, passengers.:
Please maintain visual contact...</i>

159
00:11:49,908 --> 00:11:52,243
<i>...with your personal belongings
at all times.</i>

160
00:11:52,452 --> 00:11:54,871
<i>Any bags left unattended
will be confiscated...</i>

161
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:57,040
<i>...by airport personnel.</i>

162
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:07,634
You brought a meth lab
to the airport?

163
00:12:07,842 --> 00:12:10,470
What? You said we were in a hurry.
I saved us a trip.

164
00:12:10,678 --> 00:12:12,847
Yeah. Did you get everything?
All six?

165
00:12:13,056 --> 00:12:15,391
-Yeah.
-With reflux condensers?

166
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,185
Yes. Like I said, yes.

167
00:12:17,393 --> 00:12:22,065
-Just go. Drive. Go, go.
-Okay.

168
00:12:23,566 --> 00:12:26,319
Good morning to you too, man.

169
00:13:22,834 --> 00:13:26,129
-Stupid--
-Three entire bags of Funyuns?

170
00:13:26,337 --> 00:13:28,673
What? Funyuns are awesome.

171
00:13:28,882 --> 00:13:30,925
-God.
-Hey, more for me.

172
00:13:31,134 --> 00:13:34,012
How about something
with some protein maybe?

173
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,514
Something green, huh?

174
00:13:36,723 --> 00:13:41,144
Man, I'm getting no service.

175
00:13:42,478 --> 00:13:44,772
How are you even alive?

176
00:13:45,565 --> 00:13:49,402
Hey, yo, check your phone.
You get any bars?

177
00:13:49,611 --> 00:13:51,321
Yeah, I've got a signal.

178
00:13:54,282 --> 00:13:58,077
-Hey, let me use yours, would you?
-Absolutely not.

179
00:13:58,286 --> 00:14:00,455
I have to assume
Skyler checks my phone records.

180
00:14:00,663 --> 00:14:02,707
-You know that.
-It's not business, all right?

181
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,209
-It's personal.
-Oh, personal.

182
00:14:04,417 --> 00:14:07,212
-What, female?
-Maybe.

183
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,255
Absolutely. That's all I need.

184
00:14:09,464 --> 00:14:11,758
Skyler hits redial
and some stripper answers.

185
00:14:11,966 --> 00:14:15,678
Look, she's not a stripper, okay?
Dickwad.

186
00:14:16,262 --> 00:14:18,681
Sorry. My wife checks.

187
00:14:19,724 --> 00:14:22,852
-Drinking water?
-Yup.

188
00:14:23,061 --> 00:14:24,729
Is that all we've got?

189
00:14:24,938 --> 00:14:28,858
Ten gallons?
What, you plan on taking a bath in it?

190
00:14:34,739 --> 00:14:36,032
Oh, God.

191
00:14:42,121 --> 00:14:45,875
No, not there.
That is our workstation.

192
00:14:46,084 --> 00:14:49,379
-Oh, our "workstation."
-That's right.

193
00:14:50,213 --> 00:14:53,800
Why don't you try to find a place
where it won't get lost?

194
00:14:54,008 --> 00:14:55,552
Considering it's our only set...

195
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,721
...and we are a million miles
from nowhere.

196
00:15:04,561 --> 00:15:07,897
Why don't you try
sticking them up your ass sideways?

197
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:13,022
Two-point-three-five pounds.

198
00:17:13,231 --> 00:17:15,984
Two-point-three-five.

199
00:17:16,192 --> 00:17:17,861
That's the last of it.

200
00:17:20,321 --> 00:17:23,867
-How many total?
-Nineteen.

201
00:17:24,409 --> 00:17:27,078
So dollar-wise?

202
00:17:27,287 --> 00:17:28,913
How much?

203
00:17:29,122 --> 00:17:32,250
Well, median weight 2.2 pounds...

204
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:37,213
...that's 41.8,
call that 42 pounds, at....

205
00:17:37,422 --> 00:17:39,799
-What are we selling for these days?
-Forty a pound.

206
00:17:40,008 --> 00:17:42,802
-Forty thousand dollars?
-Hey, you said raise the prices.

207
00:17:43,011 --> 00:17:45,889
All right, that's 40 times 42...

208
00:17:46,097 --> 00:17:49,142
...minus distribution charges....

209
00:17:51,394 --> 00:17:52,562
What?

210
00:17:54,188 --> 00:17:55,481
What?

211
00:17:56,232 --> 00:17:58,568
Six hundred seventy-two
thousand dollars.

212
00:17:58,776 --> 00:18:01,404
-All in?
-No.

213
00:18:02,697 --> 00:18:04,240
Each.

214
00:18:04,866 --> 00:18:05,867
Each?

215
00:18:07,285 --> 00:18:09,746
-Each.
-Six hundred and--?

216
00:18:09,954 --> 00:18:12,415
Seventy-two thousand dollars each.

217
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:16,085
Each. Yes! Hell, yeah!

218
00:18:16,294 --> 00:18:21,007
Hey, come high, baby.
Come on. Yes. Come on.

219
00:18:21,966 --> 00:18:25,053
Yes! Yes!

220
00:18:29,015 --> 00:18:31,935
Well, there goes the generator.

221
00:18:32,143 --> 00:18:34,479
I think that's it for the gas.

222
00:18:34,687 --> 00:18:36,189
Perfect timing, yo.

223
00:18:36,397 --> 00:18:39,275
-How do you figure that?
-What do you mean?

224
00:18:39,484 --> 00:18:40,485
We're done cooking.

225
00:18:40,693 --> 00:18:43,613
I am not done
until this barrel is empty.

226
00:18:43,821 --> 00:18:44,989
Look at this.

227
00:18:45,198 --> 00:18:48,451
I'd say we've still got 10, 12 gallons
of methylamine.

228
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,788
-Come on, where's your ambition?
-Jesus. Seriously?

229
00:18:51,996 --> 00:18:54,290
We are way ahead of schedule, man,
all right?

230
00:18:54,499 --> 00:18:57,460
Plus the genny needs gas,
we're almost out of propane...

231
00:18:57,669 --> 00:19:00,588
...and my back is killing me
from that piece-of-crap cot.

232
00:19:00,797 --> 00:19:03,383
Come on, can we at least
just take the night off?

233
00:19:03,591 --> 00:19:06,135
Look, I don't have to take you back
till Tuesday, right?

234
00:19:06,344 --> 00:19:08,888
So we come back tomorrow,
strap on the sizzle...

235
00:19:09,097 --> 00:19:10,598
...and glass up the rest.

236
00:19:10,807 --> 00:19:11,808
Come on.

237
00:19:12,016 --> 00:19:14,894
There's gotta be a Denny's
out there someplace.

238
00:19:15,103 --> 00:19:16,771
Grand Slam?

239
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,148
Hot shower?

240
00:19:19,357 --> 00:19:20,483
A bed?

241
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,200
-Separate rooms.
-Yeah, that's a given.

242
00:19:32,036 --> 00:19:33,788
What the hell?

243
00:19:34,455 --> 00:19:37,542
What the...? The battery's dead.

244
00:19:40,211 --> 00:19:44,299
Jesse, back when I asked you
to put the keys in a safe place...

245
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:46,134
...where did you put them?

246
00:19:46,342 --> 00:19:51,097
-I left them right here in the ignition.
-Son of a bitch.

247
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:53,474
Whoa, whoa, no,
this is not my fault, all right?

248
00:19:53,683 --> 00:19:55,226
-The buzzer didn't buzz.
-The what?

249
00:19:55,435 --> 00:19:57,687
The buzzer that buzzes
when you put the keys in...

250
00:19:57,896 --> 00:19:59,522
...to let you know the battery's on.

251
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:01,399
I know that. It didn't buzz.

252
00:20:01,608 --> 00:20:03,902
Look, I didn't turn the key
or anything, all right?

253
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:07,030
I'm not stupid.
Did you hear the buzzer buzz?

254
00:20:07,238 --> 00:20:09,365
I did not. It's faulty.
It's a faulty mechanism.

255
00:20:09,574 --> 00:20:12,202
Is this just a genetic thing with you?
Is it congenital?

256
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:15,038
Did your mother drop you
on your head when you were a baby?

257
00:20:15,246 --> 00:20:16,331
The buzzer did not buzz.

258
00:20:16,539 --> 00:20:18,708
And you're the one
that made me move the keys.

259
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:20,543
Yes, I see your point.

260
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:23,379
Your imbecility being what it is,
I should've known to say:

261
00:20:23,588 --> 00:20:26,799
"Jesse, don't leave the keys
in the ignition the entire two days."

262
00:20:27,008 --> 00:20:29,636
I wanted to leave them
on the counter, bitch.

263
00:20:29,844 --> 00:20:32,222
Oh, I'm sorry, oh, the workstation.

264
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,349
-Jesus.
-Okay, just....

265
00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:42,482
All right, so we need
to jump the battery somehow.

266
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:44,317
Okay.

267
00:20:44,526 --> 00:20:45,735
How?

268
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:57,121
You gonna be okay?

269
00:20:57,622 --> 00:20:59,499
Oh, damn it.

270
00:21:01,084 --> 00:21:02,877
What's it taste like?

271
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:04,546
Bad, huh?

272
00:21:11,844 --> 00:21:14,055
This is good.
This is good. Right here.

273
00:21:14,264 --> 00:21:17,308
Okay. There.

274
00:21:18,643 --> 00:21:21,271
Here. Red to red, black to black.

275
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:30,905
Positive, negative.
All right. Start it up.

276
00:21:34,534 --> 00:21:36,786
What the hell's wrong
with this thing?

277
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:39,914
-You have to really pull.
-I am.

278
00:21:40,123 --> 00:21:41,916
No, really pull, not like a girl.

279
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:44,794
You know what? Pull this.
I am pulling.

280
00:21:45,378 --> 00:21:48,464
It just needs to warm up a little.
All right.

281
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:51,968
Oh, my God.

282
00:21:53,469 --> 00:21:55,305
Oh, jeez.

283
00:22:19,621 --> 00:22:23,291
Well done, Jesse, as always. Just....

284
00:22:24,626 --> 00:22:26,127
Well done.

285
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:29,255
God.

286
00:22:50,818 --> 00:22:54,239
Come on, you bitches.

287
00:22:54,447 --> 00:22:56,533
Hear me now.

288
00:22:58,201 --> 00:23:00,119
Damn it.

289
00:23:07,293 --> 00:23:08,962
Stupid.

290
00:23:13,049 --> 00:23:15,301
Okay, now we have to use
your phone.

291
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,637
This is ruined. Do you understand?
Just ruined.

292
00:23:18,137 --> 00:23:19,847
You hooked it up wrong
and blew it up.

293
00:23:20,056 --> 00:23:22,809
No, no, no.
That is not what happened.

294
00:23:23,017 --> 00:23:24,143
How do you know?

295
00:23:24,352 --> 00:23:27,730
What I know is that I wasn't the one
who dumped out the last of our water.

296
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:29,691
-That's what I know.
-There was a fire.

297
00:23:29,899 --> 00:23:31,734
Excuse me for thinking on my feet.

298
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:34,028
Is that what you were--?
You were thinking?

299
00:23:34,237 --> 00:23:36,072
Now that we have
identified the problem--

300
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:38,491
You and thinking,
that's the problem.

301
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:43,746
Look, somebody is going to
have to pick us up, all right?

302
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:46,207
Your wife is not gonna notice
one little call.

303
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:50,086
Mr. White, come on.

304
00:23:50,587 --> 00:23:51,754
God.

305
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:57,051
All right, look, just make it snappy.

306
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:00,346
-Roaming drains the battery.
-All right.

307
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,351
Yo, Skinny, hey.

308
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,730
Yeah, yeah. Listen, man,
I need you to come pick us up.

309
00:24:08,938 --> 00:24:13,401
Now, all right? We're stuck out here.
You got a pen for directions?

310
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:15,445
Look, pencil's fine, retard.

311
00:24:15,653 --> 00:24:18,114
Just something to write with.
It doesn't matter.

312
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:19,657
All right, so you ready?

313
00:24:19,866 --> 00:24:23,953
All right, so you're gonna head west
on the 40 for like, what, 30 miles?

314
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:28,791
And you're gonna go past the casino
with the big arrows in the parking lot.

315
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,835
All right--
No, big arrows, giant arrows.

316
00:24:31,044 --> 00:24:33,254
They light up and blink.
You can't miss them.

317
00:24:33,463 --> 00:24:36,716
Then you're gonna wanna take it slow,
because there's this dirt road.

318
00:24:36,925 --> 00:24:39,802
It's right before the white sign
with a 3 on it, okay?

319
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:42,764
Now you're gonna be way, way out
in the boonies, okay?

320
00:24:42,972 --> 00:24:47,227
Like crazy far, so just keep heading
down that dirt road for like what?

321
00:24:47,435 --> 00:24:49,229
About another 15 miles.

322
00:24:49,437 --> 00:24:52,190
-Really? That far?
-Yeah. Hurry up. The battery.

323
00:24:52,398 --> 00:24:55,485
All right, just go down that road
for like 15 more miles, all right?

324
00:24:55,693 --> 00:24:59,405
I mean, we're way the hell out here.
All right?

325
00:24:59,614 --> 00:25:03,117
Oh, and, yo, hey, listen.
Bring water.

326
00:25:03,326 --> 00:25:04,953
Leave now.

327
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:06,996
Here.

328
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:08,831
He's coming.

329
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:17,674
There was this guy
on the Discovery Channel...

330
00:25:17,882 --> 00:25:20,301
...who broke his leg
mountain biking...

331
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:23,179
...and he had to drink urine for....

332
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:26,266
You know,
just until the forest ranger found him.

333
00:25:26,474 --> 00:25:32,605
He said it tasted like really hot,
really old soda.

334
00:25:35,316 --> 00:25:38,528
Look, we should just call, you know?

335
00:25:38,736 --> 00:25:42,532
I'll be quick, just be like,
"Yo, where are you?"

336
00:25:44,909 --> 00:25:46,369
All right.

337
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,506
Come on.

338
00:26:00,383 --> 00:26:02,677
Yo. Yo, where are you?

339
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:05,179
Oh, so you saw the white sign?

340
00:26:05,388 --> 00:26:07,932
Yes, he's almost here.

341
00:26:08,141 --> 00:26:11,936
Oh, man.
We're getting really freaked out.

342
00:26:12,145 --> 00:26:14,606
All right, so you're on the dirt road?

343
00:26:14,814 --> 00:26:16,816
He's on the dirt road. Good. Good.

344
00:26:17,025 --> 00:26:20,111
You just crossed the river?
Yeah. Have you seen anything?

345
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,405
Wait, wait. What river?

346
00:26:23,573 --> 00:26:24,991
Yeah, hey, yo, what river?

347
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,744
What the hell river you talking about?
There's no river.

348
00:26:27,952 --> 00:26:30,163
Hey, yo, Pete. Yo, Pete, can you--?

349
00:26:32,498 --> 00:26:34,083
Phone's dead.

350
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,632
Now what?

351
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:46,679
Mr. White, what now?

352
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:51,517
Oh, come on. Seriously?

353
00:27:25,051 --> 00:27:26,803
What's this?

354
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,099
I'm trying to...

355
00:27:31,558 --> 00:27:34,060
...trickle-charge the battery.

356
00:27:34,894 --> 00:27:36,855
Seriously?

357
00:27:37,272 --> 00:27:39,315
Just by turning that thing?

358
00:27:39,524 --> 00:27:41,317
The commutator.

359
00:27:42,026 --> 00:27:44,487
It's the part
which generates the electricity.

360
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:49,659
Usually this little piston engine
turns it...

361
00:27:50,743 --> 00:27:53,955
...but considering that it's lying here
completely totalled....

362
00:27:58,543 --> 00:28:00,295
Anyway.

363
00:28:03,006 --> 00:28:05,341
Apply a little elbow grease.

364
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:09,929
It'll take longer, a lot longer...

365
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:13,016
...but theoretically...

366
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:16,144
...it should work.

367
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:19,647
Theoretically.

368
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:26,362
It has to work.

369
00:28:27,238 --> 00:28:29,073
You understand?

370
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,460
Can I try?

371
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:46,716
Yeah.

372
00:29:21,834 --> 00:29:23,670
How much longer?

373
00:29:25,838 --> 00:29:27,507
I don't know.

374
00:29:42,856 --> 00:29:44,607
Now?

375
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:46,442
Hey.

376
00:29:47,277 --> 00:29:49,070
Mr. White.

377
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:03,793
Hey.

378
00:30:05,295 --> 00:30:06,671
Yeah?

379
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,302
Yo, man, you hanging in?

380
00:30:13,136 --> 00:30:15,013
Yeah, I'm good.

381
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:20,894
It's gotta be ready by now, right?

382
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:26,441
No, give it a little longer...

383
00:30:26,649 --> 00:30:28,735
...just to make sure we're--

384
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:45,877
Methylamine doesn't spoil...

385
00:30:46,085 --> 00:30:47,545
...does it?

386
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:54,344
No. That's not why we're here.

387
00:31:06,356 --> 00:31:07,899
Yo.

388
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:09,943
Lie much?

389
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:19,661
Here, push.

390
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:37,178
Okay, okay, okay.

391
00:31:38,638 --> 00:31:40,056
Now.

392
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:43,184
Go on.

393
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,648
Please, please, please.

394
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,543
Yes. Yes.

395
00:32:11,838 --> 00:32:15,341
Come on. Damn. No, please, God.

396
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:18,052
No. God.

397
00:32:20,054 --> 00:32:23,182
Please. Please.

398
00:32:40,241 --> 00:32:43,536
Why couldn't I have just gone
to Santa Fe?

399
00:32:43,745 --> 00:32:46,706
Why? Why?

400
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,422
Mr. White.

401
00:32:54,631 --> 00:32:56,257
Mr. White!

402
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,475
What are you doing?

403
00:33:07,101 --> 00:33:08,811
Mr. White?

404
00:33:10,104 --> 00:33:12,023
Oh, God.

405
00:33:29,499 --> 00:33:31,626
I have this coming.

406
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:35,672
What?

407
00:33:38,341 --> 00:33:40,468
I have it coming.

408
00:33:42,512 --> 00:33:44,597
I deserve this.

409
00:33:45,139 --> 00:33:47,016
Hey, snap out of it.

410
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:51,187
All right, first off, everything you did,
you did for your family.

411
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:52,897
Right?

412
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:57,735
All I ever managed to do...

413
00:33:58,111 --> 00:34:01,281
...was worry and disappoint them...

414
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:03,825
...and lie.

415
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:06,619
Oh, God.

416
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,747
All the lies.

417
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:13,459
I can't even....

418
00:34:13,668 --> 00:34:16,671
I can't even keep them straight
in my head anymore.

419
00:34:17,881 --> 00:34:20,550
You know what? Screw this.

420
00:34:20,758 --> 00:34:24,345
I'm walking. You can come or not.

421
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:28,850
Where's my other shoe?

422
00:34:30,393 --> 00:34:33,313
Jesse. Jesse.

423
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:38,359
Your body...

424
00:34:38,568 --> 00:34:42,405
...is running dangerously low
on electrolytes.

425
00:34:44,157 --> 00:34:47,702
Sodium, potassium, calcium.

426
00:34:48,077 --> 00:34:50,371
And when they're gone...

427
00:34:50,914 --> 00:34:54,375
...your brain ceases to communicate
with your muscles.

428
00:34:55,084 --> 00:35:00,673
Your lungs stop breathing,
your heart stops pumping.

429
00:35:00,882 --> 00:35:04,886
You go marching out there...

430
00:35:05,094 --> 00:35:08,973
...and within an hour,
you will be dead.

431
00:35:09,182 --> 00:35:13,269
Okay, you need to cut out
all your loser crybaby crap right now...

432
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:15,396
...and think of something scientific.

433
00:35:15,605 --> 00:35:18,858
Something--
Something scientific, right.

434
00:35:19,067 --> 00:35:22,028
What? Come on, man.
You're smart, all right?

435
00:35:22,237 --> 00:35:24,906
You made poison out of beans, yo.

436
00:35:25,865 --> 00:35:28,368
All right, look. We got--

437
00:35:28,576 --> 00:35:33,706
We got an entire lab right here,
all right?

438
00:35:33,915 --> 00:35:35,959
How about you take
some of these chemicals...

439
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:38,753
...and mix up some rocket fuel?

440
00:35:38,962 --> 00:35:41,881
And we can just send up
a signal flare.

441
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:45,385
Or you make some kind of robot
to get us help...

442
00:35:45,593 --> 00:35:48,304
...or a homing device...

443
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:50,348
...or build a new battery or....

444
00:35:50,557 --> 00:35:52,392
Or wait, no.

445
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,853
What if we just take some stuff
off of the RV...

446
00:35:55,061 --> 00:35:58,523
...and build it into something
completely different?

447
00:35:58,731 --> 00:36:01,609
You know, like a....
Like a dune buggy.

448
00:36:01,818 --> 00:36:05,280
And that way,
we can just dune-buggy or....

449
00:36:06,155 --> 00:36:10,451
What? Hey. What is it?

450
00:36:11,578 --> 00:36:12,996
What?

451
00:36:13,913 --> 00:36:16,791
Do you have any money?

452
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,126
Change, I mean. Coins.

453
00:36:18,334 --> 00:36:21,129
-Yeah, I got a bunch from the--
-Okay.

454
00:36:21,337 --> 00:36:23,172
-Yes.
-Gather them.

455
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:27,260
And washers and nuts and bolts
and screws...

456
00:36:27,468 --> 00:36:30,847
...and whatever little pieces of metal
we can think of that is galvanized.

457
00:36:31,055 --> 00:36:34,642
It has to be galvanized or solid zinc.

458
00:36:34,851 --> 00:36:37,061
-Solid zinc, okay.
-And-- And bring me--

459
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:39,647
Bring me brake pads.

460
00:36:39,856 --> 00:36:43,443
The front wheels should have discs.
Take them off and bring them to me.

461
00:36:43,651 --> 00:36:46,404
-Okay. Brake pads, okay.
-Brake pads.

462
00:36:50,825 --> 00:36:51,993
What are we building?

463
00:36:52,785 --> 00:36:55,747
-You said it yourself.
-A robot?

464
00:36:56,706 --> 00:36:58,082
-A battery.
-Yes.

465
00:36:58,291 --> 00:37:00,168
Move!

466
00:37:11,554 --> 00:37:15,600
This doesn't look like any battery
I ever saw.

467
00:37:15,808 --> 00:37:17,977
Well, trust me, it is a battery.

468
00:37:18,728 --> 00:37:21,940
Or rather, one cell of a battery.

469
00:37:23,358 --> 00:37:26,069
Here. Cut up the last two sponges.

470
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:27,946
Remember the electrolytes?

471
00:37:29,322 --> 00:37:30,490
Well, think about it.

472
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:34,369
A battery is a galvanic cell.

473
00:37:34,577 --> 00:37:37,330
It's no more than an anode
and a cathode...

474
00:37:37,539 --> 00:37:39,666
...separated by an electrolyte, right?

475
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,460
-Right.
-Yeah, well, anyway.

476
00:37:42,669 --> 00:37:46,297
Here. On one side,
you have mercuric oxide...

477
00:37:46,506 --> 00:37:48,716
...and graphite
from your brake pads.

478
00:37:48,925 --> 00:37:53,096
This is the cathode.
This is the positive terminal.

479
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:57,559
This is where the supply of current
flows out from, you see?

480
00:37:58,268 --> 00:38:00,395
Then.... Here, I'll show you.

481
00:38:00,603 --> 00:38:03,147
On the opposite side is our anode.

482
00:38:03,606 --> 00:38:05,191
This.

483
00:38:06,609 --> 00:38:08,152
It's zinc.

484
00:38:08,361 --> 00:38:13,449
It's what we find in our coins
and anything galvanized.

485
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:17,078
-So the sponge is the electrolyte?
-Yeah.

486
00:38:17,287 --> 00:38:21,165
Well, no, the potassium hydroxide
is the electrolyte.

487
00:38:21,374 --> 00:38:25,461
But, yes, that's what I'm soaking
the sponges in.

488
00:38:26,462 --> 00:38:27,922
Good.

489
00:38:28,798 --> 00:38:33,720
Good. And now, what shall we use...

490
00:38:33,928 --> 00:38:36,598
...to conduct
this beautiful current with?

491
00:38:37,015 --> 00:38:42,145
What one particular element
comes to mind?

492
00:38:47,942 --> 00:38:49,819
Wire.

493
00:38:51,988 --> 00:38:53,489
Copper.

494
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:55,742
-Oh, I mean--
-Copper.

495
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:57,368
Right.

496
00:38:57,952 --> 00:39:02,457
The only question now is
will this supply enough current?

497
00:39:02,665 --> 00:39:05,585
And how many cells will we need?

498
00:39:05,793 --> 00:39:08,671
We've only got material enough
for six.

499
00:39:14,093 --> 00:39:15,762
Okay.

500
00:39:18,681 --> 00:39:21,809
Put the lid on. Wait. Positive.

501
00:39:22,018 --> 00:39:23,478
All right.

502
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,440
Cathode.

503
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,155
Anode.

504
00:39:34,364 --> 00:39:37,367
Damn. That is good.

505
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:40,870
That is very good.
Okay. Here we go.

506
00:40:00,849 --> 00:40:01,850
Come on.

507
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:48,521
<i>Attention, passengers.:
Please maintain visual contact...</i>

508
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:51,024
<i>...with your personal belongings
at all times.</i>

509
00:40:51,232 --> 00:40:53,735
<i>Any bags left unattended
will be confiscated by....</i>

510
00:40:53,943 --> 00:40:55,695
How's the...?

511
00:40:57,947 --> 00:40:59,449
It's fine.

512
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:13,755
I know I can trust you to....

513
00:41:15,298 --> 00:41:17,091
Yeah.

514
00:41:18,927 --> 00:41:21,721
Hey, whatever happens...

515
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:24,599
...your family will get your share.

516
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:29,020
Thank you.

517
00:41:37,987 --> 00:41:39,614
So...

518
00:41:43,201 --> 00:41:46,621
...I'll be hearing from you, yeah?

519
00:41:50,458 --> 00:41:51,960
Yeah.

520
00:42:10,687 --> 00:42:12,647
<i>How's everyone doing?</i>

521
00:42:15,817 --> 00:42:18,570
Is that baby ever gonna come out,
you think?

522
00:42:19,821 --> 00:42:23,825
-I know. I know, enough already. It's--
-I'm teasing.

523
00:42:24,033 --> 00:42:25,994
Everything in its time.

524
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:30,456
Walt, I have your scan results.

525
00:42:31,833 --> 00:42:35,378
-Yeah.
-You're showing signs of remission.

526
00:42:39,007 --> 00:42:41,593
-Oh, my God.
-I wanna clarify.

527
00:42:41,801 --> 00:42:44,512
There are misconceptions
about what remission signifies.

528
00:42:44,721 --> 00:42:47,098
It does not mean
that the patient is cured.

529
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,350
To classify someone
as in remission...

530
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:52,270
...we only need to determine
that the tumour hasn't grown.

531
00:42:52,478 --> 00:42:54,856
That it hasn't grown? Jesus.

532
00:42:55,565 --> 00:42:56,608
Technically speaking...

533
00:42:56,816 --> 00:42:59,861
...a tumour can remain
the exact same size it was before...

534
00:43:00,069 --> 00:43:02,530
...and the patient
could still be in remission.

535
00:43:02,739 --> 00:43:06,284
Now, in Walt's case,
with a stage lll adenocarcinoma...

536
00:43:06,492 --> 00:43:08,494
...I'd like to see, I hope to see...

537
00:43:08,703 --> 00:43:12,332
...at least a 25- to 35-percent
reduction in tumour mass...

538
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:18,046
...something to tell me that the cancer
has responded to the therapy.

539
00:43:18,254 --> 00:43:20,048
Everybody still with me?

540
00:43:21,591 --> 00:43:25,220
And how has my cancer responded?

541
00:43:25,428 --> 00:43:28,806
Walt, your tumour has shrunk
by 80 percent.

542
00:43:34,729 --> 00:43:36,564
-Oh, my God.
-Wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry.

543
00:43:36,773 --> 00:43:39,025
Wait, I'm really.... I'm confused.

544
00:43:39,234 --> 00:43:41,653
Is--? Isn't 80 percent a lot?

545
00:43:42,654 --> 00:43:46,908
-Mom, yeah.
-Yes, 80 percent is a lot.

546
00:43:47,867 --> 00:43:50,245
-Okay, but, I'm-- Wait--
-Sweetheart, you were right.

547
00:43:50,453 --> 00:43:53,206
-It's very good news.
-It's very good news.

548
00:43:53,414 --> 00:43:56,459
-Oh, my God.
-My God, are you kidding me?

549
00:43:56,668 --> 00:44:00,880
Just when I try to get out,
they pull me back in.

550
00:44:09,639 --> 00:44:11,307
That's great.

551
00:44:12,976 --> 00:44:16,187
Now, that cough is the other thing
we need to discuss.

552
00:44:16,396 --> 00:44:20,275
According to your scan, Walt,
you have radiation pneumonitis.

553
00:44:20,483 --> 00:44:23,611
It's okay. This is fairly common.

554
00:44:24,487 --> 00:44:26,197
See that scary-looking thing there?

555
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:30,243
That's tissue inflammation.
It's a reaction to your radiotherapy.

556
00:44:30,827 --> 00:44:33,705
It's usually not serious,
but it can produce a cough like that.

557
00:44:33,913 --> 00:44:35,999
I'll prescribe some prednisone.

558
00:44:36,207 --> 00:44:39,127
Tissue inflammation? I....

559
00:44:39,335 --> 00:44:41,296
Are you sure about that? I mean, I--

560
00:44:41,504 --> 00:44:47,302
Because the other day,
I was coughing up some blood.

561
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,513
-What?
-You probably have a tear...

562
00:44:50,722 --> 00:44:52,307
...in your oesophagus
from coughing.

563
00:44:52,515 --> 00:44:55,310
That can be serious.
You could rupture and bleed to death.

564
00:44:55,685 --> 00:44:58,897
This is something we're gonna have to
deal with before you leave today.

565
00:44:59,105 --> 00:45:01,983
Wait a minute. When did this happen?
Why didn't you tell me?

566
00:45:02,192 --> 00:45:04,736
-I'm sorry, I just--
-No more secrets, Walt.

567
00:45:04,944 --> 00:45:08,656
With something like this,
you have to call me immediately.

568
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:13,036
Now, with these results,
we're not completely out of the woods.

569
00:45:13,244 --> 00:45:15,163
But now at least
we have some options...

570
00:45:15,371 --> 00:45:18,249
...the most important of which
is time.

571
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,753
We'll have more to discuss
in the next few weeks.

572
00:45:21,961 --> 00:45:25,757
But for now, I'd say that you folks
have earned some celebrating.

573
00:45:29,219 --> 00:45:31,095
-Yes.
-Yeah.

574
00:45:31,304 --> 00:45:32,472
Oh, my God.
