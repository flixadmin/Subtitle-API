1
00:00:00,655 --> 00:00:02,606
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,364 --> 00:00:05,731
After five years
on a hellish island,

3
00:00:06,376 --> 00:00:08,876
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:08,878 --> 00:00:11,212
to save my city.

5
00:00:11,214 --> 00:00:15,183
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:15,185 --> 00:00:19,971
To honor my friend's memory,
I must be someone else.

7
00:00:19,973 --> 00:00:22,940
I must be something else.

8
00:00:22,942 --> 00:00:25,643
Previously on "Arrow"...

9
00:00:25,645 --> 00:00:27,779
There's a new player
we've been tracking.

10
00:00:27,781 --> 00:00:31,065
We've been calling
him...Deathstroke.

11
00:00:31,067 --> 00:00:33,735
I have
a proposal for you men.

12
00:00:33,737 --> 00:00:35,820
Roy was injected
with the serum.

13
00:00:35,822 --> 00:00:38,456
He's alive. But we are going
to have to keep an eye on him.

14
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:39,355
Stay away from Thea.

15
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,793
No.

16
00:00:40,794 --> 00:00:42,443
She's not safe when
she's around you.

17
00:00:42,445 --> 00:00:44,212
You love her,
and that's why

18
00:00:44,214 --> 00:00:45,963
you're going to do
what I'm asking.

19
00:00:45,965 --> 00:00:48,750
How could you not tell me
Malcolm Merlyn was my father?!

20
00:00:48,752 --> 00:00:50,468
I believed in you.

21
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,453
As of 30 minutes ago,

22
00:00:52,455 --> 00:00:54,055
your company
belongs to me.

23
00:00:54,057 --> 00:00:56,391
Slade. You're working for him.

24
00:00:56,393 --> 00:01:00,094
I know Oliver Queen
is the Arrow.

25
00:01:07,686 --> 00:01:11,572
I don't think
my eye holes line up properly.

26
00:01:11,574 --> 00:01:13,357
Is anyone else
having this problem?

27
00:01:13,358 --> 00:01:15,858
Don't be nervous.
I'm a lot nervous.

28
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,443
This is a big move,
even for us.

29
00:01:17,445 --> 00:01:19,278
And we've cornered
the market on big moves.

30
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,930
Slade didn't
give us any choice.

31
00:01:20,932 --> 00:01:23,032
Yeah, as far as plans go,
this is not a good one.

32
00:01:23,034 --> 00:01:24,951
Felicity.
This was your plan.

33
00:01:24,953 --> 00:01:26,619
I didn't think
you'd actually say yes.

34
00:01:26,621 --> 00:01:28,621
We're here.

35
00:01:43,086 --> 00:01:46,005
Ughhh!

36
00:01:46,007 --> 00:01:48,624
Aahh! Ohh!

37
00:01:48,626 --> 00:01:51,427
Hey! That man
used to work for me.

38
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:53,596
And how he works
for our enemy.

39
00:01:53,598 --> 00:01:55,798
Security cameras
are down.

40
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,466
You all remember
the skeleton key?

41

Courtesy of William Tockman,
aka the Clock King.

42
00:01:59,804 --> 00:02:03,155
It can open any lock.
Including this one.

43
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:10,980
This is where we met Barry.

44
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:20,656
These are plug n' play.

45
00:02:20,658 --> 00:02:22,324
Fasten them to what
we talked about.

46
00:02:22,326 --> 00:02:23,960
Let the C4 do the rest.

47
00:02:23,962 --> 00:02:26,495
Been a while
since I've blown anything up.

48
00:02:26,497 --> 00:02:27,880
Quick and clean.

49
00:02:35,472 --> 00:02:38,608
I'm a bomber.
I can't believe I'm a bomber.

50
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,977
I wonder if I can list that
on my résume under special skills.

51
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:43,145
Freeze!

52
00:02:47,651 --> 00:02:50,519
We have to go.

53
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,695
Thermal shows
everybody's out.

54
00:03:06,804 --> 00:03:10,205
It's just a building,
Oliver.

Cowards.

00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:26,906
Who else would
needlessly destroy

59
00:03:26,908 --> 00:03:29,525
cutting edge, scientific
and medical technology

60
00:03:29,527 --> 00:03:31,027
whose sole purpose

61
00:03:31,029 --> 00:03:32,728
is to make
Starling City

62
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,864
a healthier
and safer place?

63
00:03:34,866 --> 00:03:37,199
As CEO of Queen
Consolidated,

64
00:03:37,201 --> 00:03:39,234
I have a message
to the terrorist

65
00:03:39,236 --> 00:03:41,704
who committed this
unspeakable act.

66
00:03:41,706 --> 00:03:45,508
You will be caught,
and punished.

67
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:47,126
For the record,
I hated her

68
00:03:47,128 --> 00:03:49,211
before we found
out she was a super villain.

69
00:03:49,213 --> 00:03:51,263
Ok. Slade's goal
is to create an army

70
00:03:51,265 --> 00:03:53,549
of human weapons
using the Mirakuru.

71
00:03:53,551 --> 00:03:56,135
To do that, he needs
an industrial centrifuge.

72
00:03:56,137 --> 00:03:58,604
Which having Isabel Rochev steal
Queen Consolidated

73
00:03:58,606 --> 00:04:00,923
from your family
gave him full access to.

74
00:04:00,925 --> 00:04:02,447
But since Applied Sciences
went kaboom,

75
00:04:02,472 --> 00:04:03,977
he can't use our technology--

76
00:04:03,978 --> 00:04:07,096
well, formerly our
for his warped science experiments.

77
00:04:07,098 --> 00:04:08,948
Slade has had us
on our heels for weeks.

78
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,783
It's about time we took
the fight to him.

79
00:04:10,785 --> 00:04:13,369
All this will do
is set him back.

80
00:04:13,371 --> 00:04:17,289
We have no way of knowing
where the next attack is coming from.

81
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:42,392
Look, you need
to drop this, ok?

82
00:04:42,417 --> 00:04:43,984
I'm fine. Really.

83
00:04:43,985 --> 00:04:45,634
How is any
of this fine?

84
00:04:45,636 --> 00:04:48,487
Look, you need
to concentrate on you.

85
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:50,089
Now listen, are you going
to your meetings?

86
00:04:50,091 --> 00:04:52,191
Yes. It's where
I talk about

87
00:04:52,193 --> 00:04:53,993
how my father's
facing prison.

88
00:04:53,995 --> 00:04:55,945
Laurel...

89
00:04:55,947 --> 00:04:58,531
This will all
blow over, ok? Please.

90
00:04:58,533 --> 00:05:00,916
No. It won't, Dad.

91
00:05:00,918 --> 00:05:03,586
You were caught
aiding and abetting the Vigilante.

92
00:05:03,588 --> 00:05:06,122
Working with him last year cost
you your detective shield.

93
00:05:06,124 --> 00:05:08,340
Now, it can cost you
18 months in prison.

94
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:11,427
They want his name.

95
00:05:11,429 --> 00:05:14,930
Do you know
who the Arrow is?

96
00:05:14,932 --> 00:05:17,717
I don't.

97
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:20,803
I swear.

98
00:05:20,805 --> 00:05:22,438
Ok, well, what about
the woman in black?

99
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,973
The one the Arrow
works with?

100
00:05:23,975 --> 00:05:27,143
Do you know
who she is?

101
00:05:27,145 --> 00:05:29,111
No.

102
00:05:29,113 --> 00:05:30,813
Well, you must
have some idea.

103
00:05:30,815 --> 00:05:32,514
Honey, I can't tell you
what I don't know.

104
00:05:32,516 --> 00:05:34,984
Time's up.

105
00:05:34,986 --> 00:05:38,804
You girls, you take
care of each other.

106
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:45,711
Do you really think he doesn't
know who the Arrow is?

107
00:05:45,713 --> 00:05:48,530
It's not like
dad to lie.

108
00:05:51,501 --> 00:05:54,754
Sometimes it's people closest
to us who lie to us best.

109
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:05,214
Where is Thea?

110
00:06:05,216 --> 00:06:07,299
She should be here
for this, too.

111
00:06:07,301 --> 00:06:08,734
I doubt she's coming.

112
00:06:08,736 --> 00:06:10,319
Well, I can't lie
to either of you--

113
00:06:10,321 --> 00:06:11,281
it's bad.

114
00:06:11,306 --> 00:06:13,844
If Isabel Rochev is one thing,
it's thorough.

115
00:06:13,845 --> 00:06:16,285
She's been laying the foundation
for this takeover for months.

116
00:06:16,661 --> 00:06:18,828
But we still own a majority of stock
in the company, correct?

117
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,384
Yes, but Isabel has diluted

118
00:06:20,409 --> 00:06:22,734
that stock to the point
where it's worthless.

119
00:06:23,117 --> 00:06:25,417
On paper,
you're virtually broke.

120
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:28,420
And what's the good news?

121
00:06:28,422 --> 00:06:29,855
We can protect
your assets.

122
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:31,273
We need to move
everything

123
00:06:31,275 --> 00:06:32,842
into a new trust
that Isabel can't touch.

124
00:06:32,844 --> 00:06:34,960
All I need is the beneficiaries
from the current trust

125
00:06:34,962 --> 00:06:37,213
to approve the transfer.

126
00:06:37,215 --> 00:06:39,715
The two of you and Thea.

127
00:06:39,717 --> 00:06:42,268
Thea needs to sign off.

128
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,103
Yes. And quickly.

129
00:06:46,089 --> 00:06:48,224
Thank you, Ned.

130
00:06:51,528 --> 00:06:54,113
Well, now I have
to become mayor.

131
00:06:54,115 --> 00:06:55,815
It seems I'll need
the income.

132
00:06:55,817 --> 00:06:57,483
Losing the company
wasn't your fault.

133
00:06:57,485 --> 00:06:58,868
It was mine.

134
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,703
I let Isabel Rochev
get the better of me.

135
00:07:00,705 --> 00:07:03,439
No. You always see
the good in people,

136
00:07:03,441 --> 00:07:04,406
even if they don't
deserve it.

137
00:07:04,408 --> 00:07:06,108
I know that better
than most.

138
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,410
Isabel is
a vindictive woman.

139
00:07:08,412 --> 00:07:09,945
She would have done this
with or without your trust.

140
00:07:09,947 --> 00:07:11,580
How do you know?

141
00:07:11,582 --> 00:07:15,084
You told me months ago
I couldn't trust her.

142
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:20,072
Your father
had a weakness

143
00:07:20,074 --> 00:07:23,092
for beautiful,
strong women.

144
00:07:25,929 --> 00:07:29,298
They were together?

145
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,483
Yes.

146
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:36,305
She was still in business school
at the time.

147
00:07:36,307 --> 00:07:40,743
The pretty intern
that caught the CEO's eye.

148
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,148
All right.

149
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:50,002
You take this to Thea,
and you convince her,

150
00:07:50,004 --> 00:07:54,006
somehow,
to help us fight back.

151
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:09,338
Hey. Will you help me up?

152
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,006
Yeah.

153
00:08:13,227 --> 00:08:14,810
Just to my trunk.

154
00:08:14,812 --> 00:08:17,313
Ok.

155
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:35,047
Ohh, look who's up.

156
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:36,882
Just in time
for all the fun.

157
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:40,219
What are you going
to do to him?

158
00:08:40,221 --> 00:08:42,671
Make him scream.

159
00:08:42,673 --> 00:08:44,990
Just like he made us.

160
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:46,308
Hmm?

161
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:49,261
They say living well
is best revenge? Ha.

162
00:08:49,263 --> 00:08:51,764
I prefer torture.

163
00:08:51,766 --> 00:08:53,215
You want first turn?

164
00:08:53,217 --> 00:08:55,017
- No.
- Please.

165
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:56,902
I can help you.

166
00:08:56,904 --> 00:09:00,022
No, doctor.
I can help you.

167
00:09:00,024 --> 00:09:02,374
What was it you said
you needed for research?

168
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,226
An eye?

169
00:09:04,228 --> 00:09:05,577
No!

170
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:07,663
Let me get you a fresh one.

171
00:09:07,665 --> 00:09:09,415
You can still
stop Slade Wilson!

172
00:09:09,417 --> 00:09:12,117
Anatoly. Wait.

173
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:14,403
What did you say?

174
00:09:14,405 --> 00:09:15,904
I can help you
stop him.

175
00:09:15,906 --> 00:09:18,824
How? That miracle drug

176
00:09:18,826 --> 00:09:21,427
of yours has turned him
into monster.

177
00:09:21,429 --> 00:09:24,413
I know. I can
turn him back.

178
00:09:24,415 --> 00:09:25,714
Ivo, what are you saying?!

179
00:09:25,716 --> 00:09:27,916
The Mirakuru.

180
00:09:27,918 --> 00:09:29,969
There's a cure.

181
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,594
Hey.

182
00:09:39,596 --> 00:09:40,980
Hey,

183
00:09:40,982 --> 00:09:42,264
is Thea here?

184
00:09:42,266 --> 00:09:43,816
No, I haven't
seen her.

185
00:09:43,818 --> 00:09:45,567
How's your dad?

186
00:09:45,569 --> 00:09:47,619
He's willing
to go to jail for the Arrow.

187
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:49,455
I know you said
you weren't worried,

188
00:09:49,457 --> 00:09:50,809
but Dig and I went
to Roy's apartment.

189
00:09:50,834 --> 00:09:51,441
It's empty.

190
00:09:51,442 --> 00:09:53,409
Seems like he cleared out
a few days ago.

191
00:09:53,411 --> 00:09:54,960
Where the hell did he go?

192
00:09:54,962 --> 00:09:58,280
Roy will have to wait.

193
00:09:58,282 --> 00:09:59,488
All right, we need to deal
with Slade,

194
00:09:59,513 --> 00:10:01,513
figure out what his next move is.

195
00:10:05,422 --> 00:10:07,423
I know Slade.

196
00:10:07,425 --> 00:10:10,259
He is not going
to stop till...

197
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,688
Aah!

198
00:10:36,287 --> 00:10:38,704
Hello, Sara.

199
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:43,825
Diggle, stay back!

200
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:04,313
Aaah!

201
00:11:08,319 --> 00:11:11,820
Don't forget who taught
you how to fight, kid.

202
00:11:34,898 --> 00:11:38,117
Excuse me, I'm looking
for my sister, Sara Lance.

203
00:11:39,586 --> 00:11:41,454
Excuse me.

204
00:11:41,456 --> 00:11:43,146
I'm Laurel Lance.
Is my sister ok?

205
00:11:43,147 --> 00:11:45,445
Oh, she'll be fine.
Just a hairline fracture of her wrist.

206
00:11:45,491 --> 00:11:46,787
We set it.

207
00:11:46,788 --> 00:11:49,548
She's got some nasty
bruises; Looks worse than it is.

208
00:11:49,645 --> 00:11:51,344
Thank you.
Nothing compared

209
00:11:51,346 --> 00:11:53,546
to her previous
injuries.

210
00:11:53,548 --> 00:11:56,049
Previous...Injuries?

211
00:11:56,051 --> 00:11:58,618
Yes, your sister has
extensive scar tissue

212
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,153
over her entire body.

213
00:12:00,155 --> 00:12:01,855
The last person I saw
with that much damage

214
00:12:01,857 --> 00:12:03,924
was a veteran
injured in Iraq.

215
00:12:03,926 --> 00:12:06,193
Has your sister
served in the military?

216
00:12:06,195 --> 00:12:08,428
No.

217
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:12,082
No, she hasn't.

218
00:12:18,623 --> 00:12:21,407
Sara.

219
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:23,426
Hey.
What happened to you?

220
00:12:23,428 --> 00:12:25,545
Oh, I'm fine.

221
00:12:25,547 --> 00:12:27,264
Ollie and I just had a little
motorcycle mishap.

222
00:12:27,266 --> 00:12:28,598
It was nothing.

223
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,217
I already got
my discharge papers.

224
00:12:30,219 --> 00:12:32,269
But your back...

225
00:12:32,271 --> 00:12:34,704
Those scars,
where did you get them?

226
00:12:34,706 --> 00:12:36,289
You ok?

227
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:38,642
I will be. You?

228
00:12:38,644 --> 00:12:41,862
Yeah. Hi.

229
00:12:41,864 --> 00:12:44,731
Hi. So tell me
what happened.

230
00:12:44,733 --> 00:12:47,267
Motorcycle accident.
It was stupid.

231
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:49,953
We were making a left turn,
this car ran a red light.

232
00:12:49,955 --> 00:12:51,988
Did you file
a police report?

233
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,874
We didn't see the point.
We're both fine.

234
00:12:53,876 --> 00:12:55,492
That's--
that's what counts, right?

235
00:12:55,494 --> 00:12:57,244
Right.

236
00:12:57,246 --> 00:12:58,962
I should really go.

237
00:12:58,964 --> 00:13:00,413
I have a deposition
in an hour.

238
00:13:00,415 --> 00:13:01,882
Ok.

239
00:13:01,884 --> 00:13:04,334
Thanks for
checking up on me.

240
00:13:04,336 --> 00:13:06,970
Always.

241
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:17,964
I know Oliver Queen
is the Arrow.

242
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:38,785
Hey.

243
00:13:38,787 --> 00:13:42,322
We missed you
yesterday.

244
00:13:42,324 --> 00:13:45,208
The meeting
with Ned Foster.

245
00:13:47,295 --> 00:13:51,164
Thea, I know that you're mad
at mom and me,

246
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,350
but we may have found a way out
of this financial mess

247
00:13:53,352 --> 00:13:56,136
where we aren't
going to lose everything.

248
00:13:56,138 --> 00:13:59,022
Mom and I both
signed, we just...

249
00:13:59,024 --> 00:14:00,840
We need
your signature,

250
00:14:00,842 --> 00:14:04,144
and hopefully we
can stop Isabel from ruining us.

251
00:14:04,146 --> 00:14:07,530
After you let her
ruin us, you mean?

252
00:14:07,532 --> 00:14:09,899
Yeah.

253
00:14:11,485 --> 00:14:14,354
It says Thea Queen here.

254
00:14:14,356 --> 00:14:15,705
Who's she?

255
00:14:15,707 --> 00:14:17,741
That's you, Speedy.

256
00:14:17,743 --> 00:14:19,409
No, it's not.

257
00:14:19,411 --> 00:14:21,995
Robert Queen
wasn't my father.

258
00:14:21,997 --> 00:14:23,496
Malcolm Merlyn was.

259
00:14:23,498 --> 00:14:25,215
Thea Merlyn.

260
00:14:25,217 --> 00:14:27,217
Kind of has
a nice ring to it.

261
00:14:27,219 --> 00:14:30,053
Merlyn was your biological
father, but Dad raised you.

262
00:14:30,055 --> 00:14:32,172
Only because
he didn't know I wasn't his.

263
00:14:32,174 --> 00:14:33,390
Hey, hey!

264
00:14:33,392 --> 00:14:37,010
He...He loved you.

265
00:14:37,012 --> 00:14:40,063
So do I, and I am
still your brother.

266
00:14:40,065 --> 00:14:42,849
No, you're not.
You're my half brother.

267
00:14:42,851 --> 00:14:45,101
And you know who else
was my half brother?

268
00:14:45,103 --> 00:14:46,319
Tommy.

269
00:14:46,321 --> 00:14:49,990
Tommy,
who I tried to kiss.

270
00:14:49,992 --> 00:14:52,993
I tried to kiss
my half brother--

271
00:14:52,995 --> 00:14:55,728
before my real
father killed him!

272
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:58,198
That's how
screwed up I am!

273
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,949
And you know
the sad part,

274
00:14:59,951 --> 00:15:02,568
I was actually starting to be
in a good place.

275
00:15:03,034 --> 00:15:06,169
I had the club,
I had Roy,

276
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:09,222
I had a brother who
wasn't lying to me.

277
00:15:09,224 --> 00:15:11,475
And for the first time
in my crazy life,

278
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:15,846
everything didn't seem so completely
and totally messed up.

279
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:20,383
I thought I was
going to be ok.

280
00:15:20,385 --> 00:15:22,602
I'm so stupid.

281
00:15:22,604 --> 00:15:23,904
You're not stupid.

282
00:15:23,906 --> 00:15:26,857
No, what I am...
Is the daughter

283
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,909
of two mass
murderers.

284
00:15:28,911 --> 00:15:31,194
Not one, but two.

285
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:33,563
So let's face it,
Ollie.

286
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:35,949
I was never
going to be ok.

287
00:15:35,951 --> 00:15:37,918
It's not in my genes.

288
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,920
Thea...

289
00:15:39,922 --> 00:15:42,005
Oliver.

290
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:44,124
We need to discuss
that security matter now.

291
00:15:49,747 --> 00:15:52,215
What do we have?

292
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:53,767
What Slade took.
Took?

293
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:55,352
He wasn't here
to kill us.

294
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:56,720
He was here because
we had something

295
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:59,088
that he wanted.
The skeleton key.

296
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:01,725
I did a full sweep.
It's the only thing that's missing.

297
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:03,860
He needs a new way
to mass produce the serum now that

298
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:05,272
we've dusted
Applied Sciences.

299
00:16:05,273 --> 00:16:06,211
With the skeleton key,

300
00:16:06,236 --> 00:16:08,009
he can get into anywhere
and take anything he wants.

301
00:16:08,266 --> 00:16:11,535
We know what he wants.
We just need to find it first.

302
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:15,772
Where is the most cutting edge
technology housed in Starling City?

303
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:21,110
The combined inventory
of every scientist

304
00:16:21,112 --> 00:16:23,580
who ever worked
at S.T.A.R. Labs.

305
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:25,332
All housed
right in here.

306
00:16:25,334 --> 00:16:28,284
I hereby christen
this building "da bomb."

307
00:16:28,286 --> 00:16:30,470
Nobody says that anymore.

308
00:16:30,472 --> 00:16:31,955
I say it.

309
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:33,790
I define
my own cool.

310
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:37,127
I still can't believe Dr. Wells
is shutting this place down.

311
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:39,396
S.T.A.R. Labs blew a hole
in Central City

312
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:41,648
when we turned
the particle accelerator on.

313
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:44,150
It's not surprising that Starling City
cancelled the lease on this facility.

314
00:16:44,152 --> 00:16:46,069
We're not exactly
the poster children

315
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:48,271
for "let us store our unregulated
prototypes in your neighborhood."

316
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:50,607
It was an accident,
Caitlin.

317
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:53,142
Yeah, well, try telling that
to the families of the people who died.

318
00:16:53,144 --> 00:16:56,496
Maybe you can figure
out how to tell that to yourself.

319
00:16:56,498 --> 00:17:00,667
Look, Cisco, let's get this inventory
done so we can go home.

320
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:06,506
I thought we were
the only ones here...

321
00:17:06,508 --> 00:17:09,542
Maybe it's one of
the security guards.

322
00:17:13,664 --> 00:17:16,099
Oh. Hey, man.

323
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:18,518
We should be wrapped
up any minute now.

324
00:17:19,704 --> 00:17:22,789
Are you getting
a bad vibe off this guy?

325
00:17:41,626 --> 00:17:43,460
The longer
you make me chase you,

326
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:45,578
the slower
I will kill you.

327
00:17:51,886 --> 00:17:54,203
Help me.

328
00:17:54,205 --> 00:17:55,872
This equipment
belonged to Arthur Light.

329
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:57,891
Wells fired him two years ago.
Why?

330
00:17:57,893 --> 00:18:00,010
Because he was
a psycho.

331
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:02,846
Please tell me
you can make this work.

332
00:18:09,987 --> 00:18:12,155
I take back what I said--

333
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:14,691
I'll make this quick.

334
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:16,860
No!

335
00:18:20,781 --> 00:18:22,866
Aaah!

336
00:18:56,951 --> 00:19:00,570
We're too late.

337
00:19:20,217 --> 00:19:23,069
Felicity!
Cisco, Caitlin!

338
00:19:23,071 --> 00:19:25,054
Are you guys ok?
He didn't hurt you, did he?

339
00:19:25,056 --> 00:19:27,473
You said "he" twice.

340
00:19:27,475 --> 00:19:28,991
Do you know
who attacked us?

341
00:19:28,993 --> 00:19:30,726
That lunatic with the mask
and the sword?

342
00:19:30,728 --> 00:19:33,529
Uh, no. I--no,
I don't know.

343
00:19:33,531 --> 00:19:37,333
I--I said "he" twice,
because on the radio,

344
00:19:37,335 --> 00:19:40,019
I heard that the person
who attacked you had man parts,

345
00:19:40,021 --> 00:19:42,505
which would make him a...He.

346
00:19:42,507 --> 00:19:45,441
I'm John Diggle, I work security
for Queen Consolidated.

347
00:19:45,443 --> 00:19:47,426
Do you have any idea what
the masked man may have taken?

348
00:19:47,428 --> 00:19:49,962
An industrial centrifuge,
by any chance?

349
00:19:49,964 --> 00:19:52,548
No. It's a secret.

350
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:54,717
What kind of secret?
The kind I have to keep.

351
00:19:54,719 --> 00:19:56,352
Well, does Cisco
have to keep it, too?

352
00:19:56,354 --> 00:19:58,888
Yes. He does.
Ok.

353
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:00,890
We're just so happy
that you guys are ok.

354
00:20:00,892 --> 00:20:02,975
How's Barry doing?

355
00:20:02,977 --> 00:20:04,360
He's the same.

356
00:20:04,362 --> 00:20:06,261
Barry's condition
deteriorated.

357
00:20:06,263 --> 00:20:07,696
They moved him to S.T.A.R. Labs.
They've been looking after him.

358
00:20:07,698 --> 00:20:10,449
That's how I met Cisco and Caitlin.
Right.

359
00:20:10,451 --> 00:20:13,402
Well, I'll come visit again,
as soon as I can.

360
00:20:13,404 --> 00:20:14,404
That would be cool.

361
00:20:14,429 --> 00:20:16,838
Don't worry,
Barry gets lots of visitors.

362
00:20:18,161 --> 00:20:20,461
Iris is there a lot.

363
00:20:20,463 --> 00:20:21,862
Iris?

364
00:20:21,864 --> 00:20:24,531
She's, um,

365
00:20:24,533 --> 00:20:27,051
his...

366
00:20:27,053 --> 00:20:28,869
Something.

367
00:20:29,871 --> 00:20:32,055
Oh.

368
00:20:32,057 --> 00:20:33,808
Sure.

369
00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:35,893
Good.

370
00:20:35,895 --> 00:20:38,211
That's just swell.

371
00:20:38,213 --> 00:20:41,765
Barry's in a coma
and he's already moved on.

372
00:20:41,767 --> 00:20:44,551
I hacked into Harrison Wells'
personal files.

373
00:20:44,553 --> 00:20:46,219
He's the director
S.T.A.R. Labs,

374
00:20:46,221 --> 00:20:47,988
which basically
makes me unstoppable.

375
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,723
And look what I found.

376
00:20:49,725 --> 00:20:52,526
It's a prototype for one of
their new bio-tech projects.

377
00:20:52,528 --> 00:20:54,445
The patent
is still pending,

378
00:20:54,447 --> 00:20:56,062
which is probably why they
didn't want to tell us what it was.

379
00:20:56,064 --> 00:20:57,247
So what is it?

380
00:20:57,249 --> 00:20:58,732
It's a biotransfuser.

381
00:20:58,734 --> 00:21:00,660
It can deliver blood
from one single patient

382
00:21:00,685 --> 00:21:02,613
into multiple patients,
at once.

383
00:21:03,313 --> 00:21:05,480
Why would Slade need
a blood transfusion?

384
00:21:05,482 --> 00:21:07,115
He doesn't.

385
00:21:07,117 --> 00:21:09,451
The prisoners that he freed from
Iron Heights last week

386
00:21:09,453 --> 00:21:11,787
to create his own
personal army do.

387
00:21:11,789 --> 00:21:15,040
With a few tweaks, Slade can
retro-fit it for the Mirakuru,

388
00:21:15,042 --> 00:21:17,125
bypassing what we know to be
a less than desirable

389
00:21:17,127 --> 00:21:19,628
ratio of success
to, you know, death.

390
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:21,763
Instead of it
metabolizing in the person,

391
00:21:21,765 --> 00:21:23,515
it happens in the machine.

392
00:21:23,517 --> 00:21:25,517
That's going to require
a whole lot of blood.

393
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:28,053
Even a man with Slade's stamina
can't handle that kind of drain.

394
00:21:28,055 --> 00:21:30,505
Good.
What do you mean?

395
00:21:30,507 --> 00:21:32,173
We let him use it.

396
00:21:32,175 --> 00:21:34,342
He'll be weak,
vulnerable,

397
00:21:34,344 --> 00:21:35,677
and that will be my
opportunity to kill him.

398
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,145
How do we find this thing?

399
00:21:37,147 --> 00:21:38,563
A machine like this
pulls an exorbitant

400
00:21:38,565 --> 00:21:40,482
amount of power
from the grid.

401
00:21:40,484 --> 00:21:42,818
When it turns on,
I'll know when and where.

402
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,686
Right now, we just wait.

403
00:21:44,688 --> 00:21:46,955
I'm tired of waiting.

404
00:21:48,074 --> 00:21:50,325
Don't listen to him,
he's lying!

405
00:21:50,327 --> 00:21:52,044
The cure is
real, I promise!

406
00:21:52,046 --> 00:21:55,297
No, he's just trying
to save his neck.

407
00:21:59,002 --> 00:22:01,035
Anthony, look at me.

408
00:22:01,037 --> 00:22:02,637
Tell us about the cure.

409
00:22:09,713 --> 00:22:12,714
I want to help you,
Sara. But first,

410
00:22:12,716 --> 00:22:14,549
you have to promise
you'll help me, too.

411
00:22:14,551 --> 00:22:16,501
She can't save your life.

412
00:22:19,722 --> 00:22:24,176
No one can, not anymore.

413
00:22:24,178 --> 00:22:26,862
All I ask is for
is a quick death.

414
00:22:26,864 --> 00:22:29,397
You don't deserve
a quick death.

415
00:22:29,399 --> 00:22:31,199
I know.

416
00:22:31,201 --> 00:22:33,752
And I'm still
asking.

417
00:22:34,754 --> 00:22:37,672
It's your call.

418
00:22:40,877 --> 00:22:42,377
Thank you.

419
00:22:42,379 --> 00:22:43,962
Start talking, Ivo!

420
00:22:43,964 --> 00:22:47,015
I was never able to replicate
the Mirakuru serum

421
00:22:47,017 --> 00:22:48,917
from the original
Japanese World War II

422
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:51,186
research I discovered.

423
00:22:51,188 --> 00:22:53,071
After conducting
experiments

424
00:22:53,073 --> 00:22:55,657
on the prisoners that I
acquired this past year,

425
00:22:55,659 --> 00:22:59,093
I was able
to synthesize a solution

426
00:22:59,095 --> 00:23:02,864
that counteracts,
reverses

427
00:23:02,866 --> 00:23:04,232
the physiological effects

428
00:23:04,234 --> 00:23:06,902
that exposure
to Mirakuru produces.

429
00:23:06,904 --> 00:23:09,604
From more than human...

430
00:23:09,606 --> 00:23:11,573
back to human.

431
00:23:11,575 --> 00:23:14,409
Where is this cure now?

432
00:23:14,411 --> 00:23:17,078
You'll keep your word
about ending my life?

433
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,081
Yes. Tell us.

434
00:23:22,219 --> 00:23:24,285
On the freighter.

435
00:23:25,838 --> 00:23:27,806
In the safe
in my quarters.

436
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:31,092
Now I believe...

437
00:23:31,094 --> 00:23:34,729
This concludes
my end of our deal.

438
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,789
Whatever you came
here to say, it takes security

439
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:02,541
about 60 seconds
to reach this floor,

440
00:24:02,543 --> 00:24:04,176
so I would
start talking.

441
00:24:04,178 --> 00:24:06,511
Where's Slade?

442
00:24:06,513 --> 00:24:09,848
I just wanted to give you
the chance to do the right thing.

443
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:13,385
I'm under 30, and I'm the CEO of
a Fortune 500 company.

444
00:24:13,387 --> 00:24:15,971
I'd say I've already
done the right thing.

445
00:24:15,973 --> 00:24:18,557
And do you even know
who Slade Wilson is?

446
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,075
Or why he's doing this?

447
00:24:20,077 --> 00:24:21,509
I don't care.

448
00:24:21,511 --> 00:24:23,645
I got what I earned.
What you earned?

449
00:24:23,647 --> 00:24:25,530
You think that
sleeping with my father

450
00:24:25,532 --> 00:24:27,832
entitles you
to my family's company?

451
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:28,838
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

452
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:30,160
Wow, he fooled around
with a lot of girls.

453
00:24:30,161 --> 00:24:32,306
I don't see any of them
ordering hostile takeovers.

454
00:24:32,307 --> 00:24:34,223
Fooled around?
Yeah.

455
00:24:35,158 --> 00:24:37,576
Is that what
your mother told you?

456
00:24:37,578 --> 00:24:42,297
Of course she would write me off
as a meaningless affair.

457
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:45,000
Slade Wilson put me
through hell.

458
00:24:45,002 --> 00:24:46,918
His training
nearly killed me.

459
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,370
Would I put myself through all that
just because I was a jilted lover?

460
00:24:49,372 --> 00:24:51,806
Honestly, I don't know
what you are!

461
00:24:51,808 --> 00:24:54,009
I was your father's
soul mate.

462
00:24:54,011 --> 00:24:56,845
He was going
to leave your mother,

463
00:24:56,847 --> 00:24:59,014
leave the company,
leave you.

464
00:24:59,016 --> 00:25:01,149
Our bags were packed.
Really?

465
00:25:01,151 --> 00:25:02,484
Your sister had to go
and break her arm

466
00:25:02,486 --> 00:25:04,402
doing something
ridiculous, no doubt.

467
00:25:04,404 --> 00:25:07,105
She fell off her horse.

468
00:25:07,107 --> 00:25:09,691
We were at the airport
when he got the call.

469
00:25:09,693 --> 00:25:11,243
I begged him not to go.

470
00:25:11,245 --> 00:25:13,411
I reminded him that
Thea wasn't even his.

471
00:25:16,449 --> 00:25:20,385
Are you saying
that my father knew?

472
00:25:20,387 --> 00:25:21,670
Of course he knew.

473
00:25:21,672 --> 00:25:23,571
He was a fool,
not an idiot.

474
00:25:23,573 --> 00:25:25,957
And like a fool,
he loved her anyway.

475
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:28,960
He promised me that we would
leave the next day.

476
00:25:28,962 --> 00:25:30,545
But instead, my internship
was terminated

477
00:25:30,547 --> 00:25:32,747
and he never spoke
to me again.

478
00:25:32,749 --> 00:25:35,267
Oh, so that's what
this is really about.

479
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:37,469
He chose us over you.

480
00:25:37,471 --> 00:25:39,721
Please escort Mr. Queen
off the premises.

481
00:25:39,723 --> 00:25:41,106
Don't touch me.

482
00:25:41,108 --> 00:25:44,276
He's no longer
welcome in this building.

483
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:45,860
My building.

484
00:25:56,238 --> 00:25:58,073
Hello?

485
00:25:58,075 --> 00:26:00,241
Thea, it's Ollie.
Listen, I just need

486
00:26:00,243 --> 00:26:01,543
five minutes
face to face.

487
00:26:01,545 --> 00:26:02,777
What do you want?

488
00:26:02,779 --> 00:26:04,913
There's something
you need to hear.

489
00:26:04,915 --> 00:26:08,583
Five minutes. Come by the club
after we close.

490
00:26:08,585 --> 00:26:10,251
Just spoke
with Felicity.

491
00:26:10,253 --> 00:26:11,720
Someone reached out
to the Arrow.

492
00:26:11,722 --> 00:26:13,023
Wants a meeting.

493
00:26:13,061 --> 00:26:13,931
Who?

494
00:26:14,017 --> 00:26:15,657
Laurel.

495
00:26:29,304 --> 00:26:32,023
You comfortable in there,
officer Lance?

496
00:26:32,025 --> 00:26:34,209
I can see if there's
an extra blanket if you're cold.

497
00:26:34,211 --> 00:26:36,795
Nah, I'm good. But hey,
now that I'm on this side of the bars,

498
00:26:36,797 --> 00:26:38,530
I think
it's just Quentin.

499
00:26:38,532 --> 00:26:40,482
I'm sure it's just
a misunderstanding.

500
00:26:40,484 --> 00:26:41,533
You'll be out of here soon.

501
00:26:41,535 --> 00:26:43,451
Yeah, I appreciate
your optimism.

502
00:26:50,843 --> 00:26:53,178
Hey!

503
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,829
Hey, what are you doing?

504
00:26:54,831 --> 00:26:57,716
Officer! We need help!
We need help!

505
00:26:57,718 --> 00:26:58,933
Whoa, whoa, what
are you doing, man?

506
00:26:58,935 --> 00:27:00,385
Remember me?

507
00:27:00,387 --> 00:27:04,172
You should, 'cause
I remember you, Officer.

508
00:27:04,174 --> 00:27:06,107
No, you can't do this.

509
00:27:06,109 --> 00:27:08,643
Aahh! All right,
take it easy.

510
00:27:08,645 --> 00:27:10,145
'Cause you and that
hooded freak show

511
00:27:10,147 --> 00:27:11,813
are the reason
I'm in this place.

512
00:27:11,815 --> 00:27:13,698
I thought I should be
the one to welcome you.

513
00:27:24,745 --> 00:27:26,044
This isn't over!

514
00:27:26,046 --> 00:27:28,546
This is not over!

515
00:27:37,729 --> 00:27:40,648
I heard about
your father being arrested.

516
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:42,283
If I could help him, I would.

517
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:43,951
That's not what
this is about.

518
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:45,786
It's funny, isn't?

519
00:27:45,788 --> 00:27:48,356
A year ago, he thought
you were a murderer.

520
00:27:48,358 --> 00:27:51,542
And me, I was--
I was drawn to you.

521
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:54,829
I couldn't
explain why, but...

522
00:27:54,831 --> 00:27:57,965
But a part of me
felt connected to you.

523
00:27:57,967 --> 00:28:01,535
You were always there.

524
00:28:01,537 --> 00:28:03,471
For me...

525
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:07,558
For my family, and for some reason,
I never asked why.

526
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,711
Are you asking now?

527
00:28:10,713 --> 00:28:12,596
I don't have to.

528
00:28:12,598 --> 00:28:15,166
Because I already
know the answer.

529
00:28:20,272 --> 00:28:23,074
Hello?
Laurel...

530
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,825
It's dad.

531
00:28:29,698 --> 00:28:31,916
What is it?

532
00:28:42,272 --> 00:28:43,659
Laurel, I am so sorry.

533
00:28:43,684 --> 00:28:45,519
We had your father
under protective custody.

534
00:28:45,743 --> 00:28:48,995
There's no such as thing
as protective custody in Iron Heights.

535
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:51,618
Dad!

536
00:28:51,636 --> 00:28:52,657
Hey.

537
00:28:53,132 --> 00:28:54,298
It's all right, sweetheart,
it's all right.

538
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,783
Hey, whoa,
don't touch the ribs!

539
00:28:55,785 --> 00:28:57,802
The ribs.

540
00:28:57,804 --> 00:29:00,287
I'm getting tired of visiting
my family members in a hospital.

541
00:29:00,289 --> 00:29:02,123
What happened?

542
00:29:02,125 --> 00:29:04,792
Oh, it's just some old
collar paid me a visit.

543
00:29:04,794 --> 00:29:08,062
I guess I'm not the most
popular guy in prison.

544
00:29:08,064 --> 00:29:11,482
Sara, do you mind giving Dad and I
a second alone, please?

545
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:15,770
Yeah, of course.

546
00:29:15,772 --> 00:29:18,089
I'll be right outside.

547
00:29:18,091 --> 00:29:19,490
Don't go far,
sweetie.

548
00:29:19,492 --> 00:29:21,442
Dad...

549
00:29:21,444 --> 00:29:23,477
What is it,
honey?

550
00:29:23,479 --> 00:29:26,631
I have to tell you something.
What is it?

551
00:29:26,633 --> 00:29:29,149
I know who the Arrow is.

552
00:29:29,151 --> 00:29:30,952
What?

553
00:29:30,954 --> 00:29:34,205
Don't say
another word.

554
00:29:34,207 --> 00:29:37,291
Don't say anything.

555
00:29:39,494 --> 00:29:41,161
Ok.

556
00:29:43,216 --> 00:29:45,182
Listen to me, there was a time
when I would have

557
00:29:45,184 --> 00:29:48,719
sold out my badge to find out his
name. You know that.

558
00:29:48,721 --> 00:29:51,322
But then I realize
I didn't care who he was.

559
00:29:51,324 --> 00:29:54,592
In fact, I didn't even want to know
who he was.

560
00:29:54,594 --> 00:29:56,010
Why not?

561
00:29:56,012 --> 00:29:58,345
'Cause I knew
if I knew who he really was,

562
00:29:58,347 --> 00:30:00,681
then he'd become
a person, right?

563
00:30:00,683 --> 00:30:04,435
Maybe he's got
a family. Friends.

564
00:30:04,437 --> 00:30:05,987
People that
care about him.

565
00:30:05,989 --> 00:30:08,539
Someone with a life.

566
00:30:08,541 --> 00:30:11,275
That he couldn't be
what I needed him to be.

567
00:30:11,277 --> 00:30:14,245
What this city
needs him to be.

568
00:30:14,247 --> 00:30:16,380
It's the Arrow
that matters.

569
00:30:16,382 --> 00:30:19,533
The man under the hood
isn't important.

570
00:30:19,535 --> 00:30:21,752
Look at me.

571
00:30:21,754 --> 00:30:24,338
Can you imagine what
it's like to be him?

572
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,407
What he has to live with
day in and day out,

573
00:30:26,409 --> 00:30:28,376
what that's
got to be like.

574
00:30:28,378 --> 00:30:30,678
Hey. The least I can do

575
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,814
is sit here and do a little bit
of time for him.

576
00:30:46,283 --> 00:30:47,839
How's your father?

577
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,107
He'll be better
once you drop all charges

578
00:30:50,109 --> 00:30:51,642
and sign his release papers.

579
00:30:51,644 --> 00:30:53,644
He is facing
18 months.

580
00:30:53,646 --> 00:30:56,063
Yes. But he is not going
to stay here another day

581
00:30:56,065 --> 00:30:57,669
unless you want me
to resign and embark

582
00:30:57,694 --> 00:30:59,434
on an exciting new career

583
00:30:59,435 --> 00:31:03,454
as a criminal defense attorney
whose sole ambition will be

584
00:31:03,456 --> 00:31:05,289
to sue
the District Attorney's office

585
00:31:05,291 --> 00:31:08,325
for wrongful arrest
and reckless endangerment.

586
00:31:10,545 --> 00:31:13,697
Your father will be
released on his own recognizance

587
00:31:13,699 --> 00:31:14,865
within the hour.

588
00:31:14,867 --> 00:31:19,386
And reinstated.
Tomorrow.

589
00:31:19,388 --> 00:31:21,805
A word of advice--

590
00:31:23,758 --> 00:31:25,676
be mindful
of the battles you choose,

591
00:31:25,678 --> 00:31:28,128
because it will not
always be this easy.

592
00:31:34,903 --> 00:31:37,488
Nice work, counselor.

593
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:39,222
Thank you.

594
00:31:39,224 --> 00:31:40,724
How's your arm?

595
00:31:40,726 --> 00:31:43,226
Mmm, fine.
Only hurts when I wave.

596
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,448
Ouch.

597
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:49,249
I'm fine, I promise.

598
00:31:49,251 --> 00:31:51,335
I know you will be.

599
00:31:54,873 --> 00:31:56,707
Thanks.

600
00:32:18,863 --> 00:32:20,781
Thank you for agreeing
to talk to me.

601
00:32:20,783 --> 00:32:24,051
You're talking.
I only agreed to listen.

602
00:32:24,053 --> 00:32:26,403
I just want to start with--

603
00:32:26,405 --> 00:32:30,040
I know you think that--

604
00:32:30,042 --> 00:32:33,610
Ahem. Hold on.

605
00:32:33,612 --> 00:32:35,662
I can't talk
right now, Felicity.

606
00:32:35,664 --> 00:32:38,115
I know. But the grid
at Collins and Main just spiked,

607
00:32:38,117 --> 00:32:40,384
drawing a hell
of a lot of power.

608
00:32:40,386 --> 00:32:42,336
Which means someone either plugged
in the world's largest hair dryer,

609
00:32:42,338 --> 00:32:44,671
or the biotransfuser
just went online.

610
00:32:44,673 --> 00:32:46,289
The power cycle
on this machine is very specific.

611
00:32:46,291 --> 00:32:48,258
You have 30 minutes,
40 tops.

612
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:51,145
I know this is selfish, Oliver,
and don't hate me for saying this,

613
00:32:51,147 --> 00:32:54,765
but...Don't go.

614
00:32:54,767 --> 00:32:57,267
If you don't get Thea
to sign those documents,

615
00:32:57,269 --> 00:32:59,636
your family loses
all of its assets.

616
00:32:59,638 --> 00:33:01,021
If I don't stop Slade right now,

617
00:33:01,023 --> 00:33:03,240
a lot of people will
lose a lot more.

618
00:34:39,114 --> 00:34:41,499
I wouldn't touch
that if I were you.

619
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:45,186
Removing him mid-cycle
will surely end his life.

620
00:34:45,188 --> 00:34:47,805
Slade, he's just a kid!
Who's here

621
00:34:47,807 --> 00:34:50,391
only because you
pushed him away.

622
00:34:50,393 --> 00:34:52,743
You were the one person
he looked up to.

623
00:34:52,745 --> 00:34:55,196
And for that,
you crushed his soul.

624
00:34:55,198 --> 00:34:57,548
We found him
at a shelter in Bludhaven.

625
00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:00,740
Pathetic.
Didn't even put up a fight.

626
00:35:01,237 --> 00:35:02,464
I will.

627
00:35:02,833 --> 00:35:04,643
Tell me how to shut it down.

628
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:08,780
If you could feel the power that is
surging through me...

629
00:35:10,916 --> 00:35:14,602
You would know that
I do not fear an arrow.

630
00:35:14,604 --> 00:35:17,205
I am stronger than
you can even imagine.

631
00:35:17,207 --> 00:35:19,073
And soon...

632
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:21,709
I will not be alone.

633
00:35:49,822 --> 00:35:51,939
You can't hurt me, kid.

634
00:36:12,127 --> 00:36:14,829
Come on, Roy.
All right, stay with me.

635
00:36:47,588 --> 00:36:49,155
He's lost
a lot of blood.

636
00:36:49,157 --> 00:36:51,323
I don't know what
the biotransfuser did to him.

637
00:36:51,325 --> 00:36:53,259
But his pulse is really weak;
He's barely breathing.

638
00:36:53,261 --> 00:36:54,961
And he needs
a real doctor.

639
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:57,296
We can't take him to a hospital--
they run tests.

640
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:59,465
We need to keep what's
in him from getting out.

641
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:00,716
What do we do now?

642
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,552
The only thing
we can do--we wait.

643
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:04,620
Well, while we're waiting, we still
have a Slade problem.

644
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:06,139
He's got 20 guys
just like him,

645
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:07,774
and we have no way
to stop him.

646
00:37:07,776 --> 00:37:10,342
Yes, we do.

647
00:37:10,344 --> 00:37:12,695
Is that what
I think it is?

648
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:14,947
Mirakuru.

649
00:37:14,949 --> 00:37:17,283
You weren't thinking
about taking it, were you?

650
00:37:17,285 --> 00:37:19,652
No.

651
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:21,821
We're going to use it
to make a cure.

652
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:25,541
Oliver, we don't even know if it's
possible to reverse the affects.

653
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:27,860
Yes, we do.

654
00:37:29,329 --> 00:37:30,830
Ivo did it.

655
00:37:31,032 --> 00:37:33,783
Why didn't you ever
tell us that, Oliver?

656
00:37:33,785 --> 00:37:36,319
Because I'm ashamed.

657
00:37:36,321 --> 00:37:38,904
Of what?

658
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:46,412
Five years ago, I had
the chance to use the cure on Slade.

659
00:37:47,547 --> 00:37:50,249
I chose to kill him.

660
00:37:50,251 --> 00:37:54,420
Everything that's happening
right now is my fault.

661
00:37:55,422 --> 00:37:58,056
I saved you
once, Sara.

662
00:37:58,058 --> 00:38:00,591
It feels like
a long time ago now.

663
00:38:00,593 --> 00:38:03,261
Time to return
the favor.

664
00:38:10,903 --> 00:38:13,655
You might not
believe it now,

665
00:38:13,657 --> 00:38:16,408
but I was considered
a good man.

666
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:20,628
A good doctor.
A good husband.

667
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:24,299
Until the Mirakuru
drove me mad.

668
00:38:24,301 --> 00:38:26,918
I didn't even
take any myself--

669
00:38:41,817 --> 00:38:44,904
You didn't have
to do that for me.

670
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:47,789
Once you take a life...

671
00:38:47,791 --> 00:38:50,542
It changes you
forever.

672
00:38:52,711 --> 00:38:54,579
And I don't
want that for you.

673
00:38:54,581 --> 00:38:56,214
Thank you.

674
00:38:57,216 --> 00:38:59,516
Schastlivchik.

675
00:38:59,518 --> 00:39:03,887
So, now what
do we do?

676
00:39:03,889 --> 00:39:08,008
Well, I don't suppose any of you
know how to pilot a submarine?

677
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,396
Thea.

678
00:39:12,398 --> 00:39:14,162
What are you doing?

679
00:39:14,163 --> 00:39:16,163
Just grabbing some stuff.
Something tells me

680
00:39:16,165 --> 00:39:17,832
the mansion's new owner
won't want my clothes here.

681
00:39:17,834 --> 00:39:19,366
Thea, wait.

682
00:39:19,368 --> 00:39:21,085
Now he's not busy.

683
00:39:21,087 --> 00:39:23,871
I'm so sorry,
that couldn't be helped.

684
00:39:23,873 --> 00:39:26,140
May I speak to you now?

685
00:39:30,211 --> 00:39:32,012
Dad knew the truth.

686
00:39:33,565 --> 00:39:34,815
What?

687
00:39:34,817 --> 00:39:36,233
He knew about Merlyn.

688
00:39:36,235 --> 00:39:38,836
How?

689
00:39:38,838 --> 00:39:40,220
He never said
anything to me.

690
00:39:40,222 --> 00:39:42,323
He didn't have to.

691
00:39:42,325 --> 00:39:44,742
Thea, whatever
dad's faults were...

692
00:39:44,744 --> 00:39:47,411
He loved us.

693
00:39:47,413 --> 00:39:49,330
All of us.

694
00:39:49,332 --> 00:39:52,833
Because we were his family.

695
00:39:52,835 --> 00:39:55,619
You were his daughter,

696
00:39:55,621 --> 00:39:59,190
and some stupid blood test
wasn't going to change that.

697
00:39:59,192 --> 00:40:01,942
He chose us.

698
00:40:03,912 --> 00:40:05,596
He chose you.

699
00:40:05,598 --> 00:40:09,049
He made a decision

700
00:40:09,051 --> 00:40:11,435
to be your father,

701
00:40:11,437 --> 00:40:14,254
even though
he didn't have to be.

702
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:19,527
So what does that tell you?

703
00:40:19,529 --> 00:40:23,096
It tells me
that he's a liar.

704
00:40:23,098 --> 00:40:25,533
Just like both of you.

705
00:40:33,442 --> 00:40:36,744
I need you guys
to do me a favor.

706
00:40:38,129 --> 00:40:39,630
This time,
it'll be our secret.

707
00:40:53,261 --> 00:40:56,564
Oliver.

708
00:41:15,483 --> 00:41:18,252
What's this for?

709
00:41:18,673 --> 00:41:21,824
Because you're
important to me.

710
