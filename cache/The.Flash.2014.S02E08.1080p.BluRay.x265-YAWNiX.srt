1
00:00:02,461 --> 00:00:06,091
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:10,185
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

3
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:13,101
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

4
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:16,275
I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.

5
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:18,685
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

6
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:21,780
but in doing so,
I opened up our world to new threats.

7
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,359
And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

8
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:27,987
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:30,656
Previously on The Flash and Arrow...

10
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,993
The person who broke into my facility
last night was Harrison Wells.

11
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:39,128
Dr. Caitlin Snow, Cisco Ramon,
meet Dr. Harrison Wells from Earth-2.

12
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,461
I came hereto help you, Barry.

13
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:42,714
He may not be
Harrison Wells from your Earth.

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,837
He has just as many secrets
as the one you knew.

15
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,639
I get these feelings sometimes.
These vibes.

16
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:51,059
I'm not sure what triggers it.
And sometimes itjust happens.

17
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:55,639
You can always talk to me.

18
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,562
- Partners?
- Partners.

19
00:00:57,808 --> 00:00:58,855
This is a million dollars.

20
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:03,064
That money is yours, once you tell Oliver
that you've lost the baby.

21
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:07,860
I've been running a lot lately,

22
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,199
trying to go faster than
I've ever gone before,

23
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:12,702
because there's someone out there
who's better,

24
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,830
faster and stronger than I am.

25
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,911
And I need to be ready.

26
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:21,882
But no matter how much I try,
or how hard I push myself,

27
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,380
I keep running into the same problem.

28
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,380
He just hit 1,375.

29
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,428
What's the fastest Barry's run?

30
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,265
Little over Mach 2,
when he ran back in time.

31
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,230
That's not good.

32
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:38,728
That's good, Barry.

33
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,398
We have our work cut out for us.

34
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,442
I'm not getting faster, am I?

35
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,695
- Well...
- No. You're not.

36
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:50,243
All right. Well, let's fix this, right?

37
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:51,741
I mean, I can't beat Zoom at this speed.

38
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,538
It felt like I was standing still
next to him.

39
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:54,789
Oh, that's because you practically were.

40
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:58,127
Zoom is at least three,
four times faster than you at this point.

41
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:00,629
How is he so much faster than Barry is,
and Jay was?

42
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:03,294
Physiology, form, strength.

43
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,044
Could be a number of things.
Attitude, diet...

44
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,053
Okay. Well, there's gotta be
something we can do about it.

45
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:13,100
So, let'sjust figure it out. Fast. Okay?

46
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,975
All right, I gotta go. I'm meeting Patty.
I'll see you. Thank you.

47
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,641
So how are we gonna help Barry?

48
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:23,895
I'm out of ideas, and we've tried
everything you suggested.

49
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,821
Well, not everything.

50
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,380
Welcome home.

51
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:50,678
Any trouble?

52
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:53,424
Nah. But believe it or not,
we got ourselves a stowaway.

53
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:54,721
Give you his name?

54
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:57,219
Didn't say.
Sat in the brig silent for three weeks.

55
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,146
He was all decked out in this
when we found him.

56
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,349
Jeez. How many are there?

57
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:06,107
Thirty-two. And I will polish them all
in blood before long.

58
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:09,656
I've waited a long time for this hunt,

59
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:13,201
and you have brought me
very close to my prey.

60
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:17,703
Mister, you're not gonna do
any hunting in those handcuffs.

61
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,494
Oh, but, Captain,
you're wearing the cuffs.

62
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,340
Who taught you that? Houdini?

63
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,304
Actually, I taught him.

64
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,662
Soon, another sacrifice will be made.

65
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:09,166
I feel you out there.

66
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:20,890
Man, this was a bloodbath.

67
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,687
Done by one person.

68
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,097
One person did all this?

69
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,982
Oh, yeah. You can see
from the blood pattern.

70
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:29,278
This guy was shot first,
then the Police Chief,

71
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:33,108
then these three were stabbed,
before finishing off the Captain.

72
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:34,908
Wow! Do you think a meta-human did it?

73
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,870
I don't know, but I found this
in all of the stab victims' wounds.

74
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,788
It's some type of cryptocrystalline.

75
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:44,289
Flint, most likely. Probably broke off
the blade during the fight.

76
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:45,665
I'll run it to make sure.

77
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,167
Let's see what stores
sell those kind of flint knives.

78
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:52,171
Will do. And I'll call you later.

79
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,260
- Okay.
- Okay.

80
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:58,182
It's so cute. You guys are trying
not to be affectionate in front of me.

81
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:01,134
No. We're just showing
some professionalism.

82
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:02,894
Yeah.

83
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,531
Advantages of a trusting manager.

84
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,907
Ah! A lot's gone down in this place.

85
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:22,955
Nice.

86
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,368
So what's up?
I thought we were gonna go to dinner.

87
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,960
Whoa. What's going on here?

88
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:34,050
I couldn't decide
which restaurant to go to,

89
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:37,050
so I thought we would create our own.

90
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:41,843
Voila'! Short rib,
Yukon gold puree and asparagus.

91
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,142
Gotta have a vegetable.

92
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,560
This is nice.

93
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:49,358
I like to cook. I didn't know if you like
red or white, so I got you both.

94
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:52,732
Ooh! Two bottles.
That's kind of dangerous, don't you think?

95
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,613
You're not gonna run away
all of a sudden, are you?

96
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:58,317
Trust me, I'm staying by your side
as long as possible.

97
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,117
Good.

98
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:05,703
You know, it's been really great
hanging out these last few weeks.

99
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:10,083
And it's helped make the move
a lot easier, so thanks.

100
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:11,625
You're very welcome.

101
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:18,383
Sorry. How did you get in here?

102
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:20,009
Hey, man, this place is closed.

103
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:25,310
You are just as beautiful in this life
as any other, Priestess Chay-Ara.

104
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,602
Priestess?

105
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,555
Uh, you gonna have to go, dude.

106
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:32,563
Not without her, dude.

107
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,486
Oh, my God! Cisco.

108
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,314
I don't understand. What do you want?

109
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,445
I believe I was clear.

110
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:49,618
Kendra's not going anywhere with you,
Highlander.

111
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:54,002
Oh, is that your name now?
Kendra? Quite boring.

112
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:57,293
I believe it allowed you
to blend in for a while.

113
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,720
Now, give her to me
and I'll make your death fast.

114
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,264
It ain't gonna happen.

115
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,307
You are done here, pal.

116
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,267
So is he.

117
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,664
Thank God, Barry.

118
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:30,079
Dude. Come on.

119
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:36,082
I can't believe you're the Flash.
And that you work with the Flash.

120
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:38,174
Yeah. Let's keep that on the DL.

121
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,552
This is the same knife that was used
to kill the men at the docks.

122
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,802
The residue's a perfect match.

123
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,054
So it is the same guy.

124
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:47,384
Definitely. But the thing is,
these blades are old. Centuries old.

125
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,678
Do you have any idea why this guy
would be after you?

126
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,309
No. I've never seen him before in my life.

127
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:54,228
Well, he was certainly
acting like he knew you.

128
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,605
He kept calling her Priestess Chay-Ara.

129
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:57,857
That's Coptic.

130
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,813
- You mean Egyptian?
- That's right.

131
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:04,907
Well, I grew up in Wisconsin
and I've never even left the States, so...

132
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,488
This guy, he's clearly
incredibly dangerous.

133
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:10,040
So I need you to at least
let us try to protect you.

134
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,332
I can put a detail on her.

135
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:12,625
You didn't see this guy, Joe.

136
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,336
No offense, but I don't think
a cop is gonna be able to protect her.

137
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:18,798
No, but we do have a few friends
who can lend a hand.

138
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,758
But we're gonna need
to leave Central City.

139
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,294
And go where?

140
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,213
You really wanna go to Star City?

141
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,265
Come on! We don't need
Team Arr0w's help.

142
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:28,682
Yeah, I think we do, man.

143
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:32,137
Man, you fought meta-humans with abilities
a lot worse than "knife-throwing."

144
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:33,604
I don't think this guy's a meta-human.

145
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:38,402
There's something different about him.
Something mystical.

146
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:39,735
Mystical, really?

147
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,064
We stop meta-humans
because we're scientists.

148
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:43,615
We can figure out
what their weaknesses are.

149
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:46,489
But we don't have any experience
when it comes to guys like this.

150
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:49,363
- With magic. They do.
- Mmm!

151
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,911
This wouldn't have anything
to do with Zoom, would it?

152
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:54,538
No. I'm just trying to keep Kendra safe.

153
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:55,835
This is the best way to do that.

154
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,504
Right. Okay. I'm with you.

155
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:01,083
But how do we even know Oliver and them
even have time to help us?

156
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,175
How busy can they be?

157
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:13,058
Oh, gosh, that's fun.
I really could do this all day.

158
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,604
Open it up.

159
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,566
They could have at least tried
to hide this chemical bomb.

160
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:21,441
Serves them right it's getting stolen
and used against them.

161
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:24,989
Ah!

162
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,867
You brought arrows to a gun fight.

163
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,451
What guns?

164
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,203
DARH KI Oh!

165
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,627
That was actually pretty clever.
Kill them.

166
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,799
"Felicity, the magnetic
arrow gag will never work."

167
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:53,931
"Yes, it will, my love,
because I am really smart."

168
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,263
And guess what, Oliver? lt did work.

169
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:57,563
Felicity? Honey?

170
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,520
It's a little hard to fight with you
doing that in my ear.

171
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:00,976
Oh, I totally forgot that
this was an open line.

172
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:02,857
Keep doing what you're doing.
Make smart decisions.

173
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,344
Ooh, you know, I gotta be honest,

174
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:32,800
I really thought we'd be doing this dance
a lot longer. Night, night.

175
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,146
What was that?

176
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,360
Damn it. Every time.

177
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:52,611
It's the Flash!
Did I know we knew the Flash?

178
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,660
We know the Flash. Okay.
I didn't know we knew the Flash.

179
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:59,914
Thank you. But I don't think that
you ran all the way here to protect us.

180
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:04,081
No, not to protect you.
I need to protect a friend.

181
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:12,926
Wow!

182
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,972
Nice new digs.

183
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,224
Also, I Just noticed, no sleeves.
Don't you get cold?

184
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:22,683
I spent the better part of five years on
an island near the North China Sea.

185
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:24,234
I don't get cold, Barry.

186
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,186
Barry! So good to see you.

187
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,691
Felicity.

188
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,819
Oh! Good to see you, Felicity.

189
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,650
How come you didn't tell me
Zoom broke your back?

190
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,235
I...

191
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:34,740
I'm so glad you're okay.

192
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,408
So this is what it's like dating her.

193
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,286
More bruises from her
than from Deathstroke.

194
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:42,581
Okay. S.T.A.R. Labs is impressive,
but this is...

195
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:45,004
This is completely wrong.

196
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,711
Did you guys even look
at the specs I sent over?

197
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:51,090
This is a tragedy. I'm mourning
for the death of engineering.

198
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:54,093
Copper wiring to handle
the processing speed

199
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:57,767
from the Palmer Satellite
or else your system is gonna overload.

200
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,640
Yeah, but that hasn't happened
since last week.

201
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,642
I mean, it didn't...
It happened yesterday.

202
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,223
- Hi.
- I'm Felicity.

203
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,435
I'm Kendra Saunders. I'm Cisco's...

204
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:13,951
She's my new beautiful friend,
who kisses me, occasionally.

205
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:17,662
That's nice.

206
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:21,241
Right. I'm Thea. This is John Diggle.
And my brother.

207
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:22,621
Oliver Queen.

208
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,244
- Hi.
- Wow.

209
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:27,752
Okay, first, I meet the Flash,
and now, the Green Arrow.

210
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:29,708
Do you have any other surprises for me?

211
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,543
Please. No more surprises.

212
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,011
Barry said that you need our help.

213
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:35,885
Somebody very dangerous is after you.

214
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,467
Yeah, and I have no idea why.

215
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,347
What's does this guy even look like?

216
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,852
Uh... Hold on.

217
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,731
Okay. This is him.

218
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,438
Yeah. See, that's something
I would never think of.

219
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,274
Hmm, kinda rockin'
that Dothraki look. Hot.

220
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,780
Let's see if facial recognition
can find a match.

221
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:04,333
That's him.

222
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,496
Yeah, strange.
This picture's from 1975.

223
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,331
Which would make him about
80 years old right now.

224
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,041
Okay, what else can you tell us?

225
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:15,637
He said we've known each other for ages,
but I've never met the man before.

226
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:17,510
But there has to be
some kind of a connection.

227
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,427
Not one I can think of.

228
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,726
I just moved to Central City,
six months ago.

229
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,428
Why'd you move there?

230
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,139
I just felt drawn to the city, I guess.

231
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,896
Kendra, there is a reason
this guy's after you. Think.

232
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,819
Look, man, we just came out here
to hide out for a bit

233
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,523
until we figure things out, so you can
just take it down just a little.

234
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:37,325
You came here because you need our help.
This is what my help looks like.

235
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,822
Oliver, I just saved you guys

236
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:41,121
from whatever the hell Flock of Seagulls
was about to do.

237
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,413
The least you can do is just...

238
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:44,240
Barry, none of us have superpowers.

239
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:46,622
You brought Kendra into our world
without knowing who she is

240
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,082
or what this dude
that is after her is looking for.

241
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:52,632
You made all of us unsafe.
So maybe you ask the questions.

242
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,837
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

243
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:58,380
- We're all friends here, right?
- Mmm-hmm.

244
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:00,431
Why don't we go back to our place
and have some drinks,

245
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:01,757
and we can talk.

246
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,143
Cool.

247
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,561
What you working on?

248
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,102
This is a formula meant to increase

249
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:12,151
a speedster's velocity
that I've been developing

250
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,571
since Zoom showed up on my Earth.

251
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:17,900
Ironically, this was meant
to help out Jay Garrick.

252
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,235
You want to give Barry a drug
to make him run faster?

253
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:23,037
Temporarily enhance the Speed Force
in his system, yes.

254
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:25,456
So you're trying to make
nitrous oxide for speedsters.

255
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:26,748
Good analogy. Yes, I tried.

256
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,576
Five times I've tried,
five times I've failed.

257
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:32,585
That's what you get when your background
is technology and not biochemistry.

258
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:35,167
- Well, then you are lucky I am here.
- What does that mean?

259
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,963
You've been thinking of this
as a mechanical problem,

260
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:38,465
not a biomechanical one.

261
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:39,761
And what does that mean?

262
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:43,850
When a speedster runs, they consume
an extraordinary amount of oxygen.

263
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:46,936
So we just need something to give
an extra boost of oxygen during that time.

264
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,138
- Like an oxygen generator.
- Exactly!

265
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:51,937
So we just need
a chemical that's rich in oxygen,

266
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:56,233
that would release it as a nearly pure gas
as it decomposes.

267
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:58,865
- Something like sodium chlorate.
- Sodium chlorate.

268
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:01,568
Then, all we need is heat
to release the oxygen.

269
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:05,121
Which a speedster generates naturally
in the form of lightning.

270
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,165
I think something like this
just might work.

271
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:09,580
You think you can help me figure it out?

272
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:11,001
I can certainly try.

273
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,798
I'm not changing my nickname.
I like Speedy.

274
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,375
Are you familiar
with my body of work?

275
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,460
If you are, then you know I can come up

276
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,717
with something so much
better than "Speedy."

277
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:26,093
Why don't you get a haircut,
and then maybe we can talk about it.

278
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,019
I think you just mad 'cause
my conditioner game is on point.

279
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:33,938
So, the CEO of Palmer Technologies
is living with Oliver Queen.

280
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:36,361
It's insane how much
life can change in six months, huh?

281
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:39,986
Which you would know better than anyone,
considering that there's another Flash,

282
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:43,489
- another Dr. Wells, from another Earth?
- Mmm-hmm.

283
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:46,321
- I mean...
- Yeah. I know. It's been trippy lately.

284
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:51,284
I wonder what Oliver's doppelganger
would look like. Bald. Pot-bellied.

285
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,377
- Uh-huh.
- Agreeable.

286
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:57,839
You seeing anyone?

287
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,959
- I am, actually.
- Good.

288
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:03,342
Patty is her name. She is amazing.

289
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:05,674
- You deserve someone amazing.
- Thanks.

290
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,219
My pigs in a blanket.

291
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:14,642
Hey, Ollie. Look, I'm sorry
that I laid all of this on you.

292
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:16,567
- I know that it wasn't fair.
- That's okay.

293
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:19,395
- I'm sorry if earlier I was a little...
- Snippy?

294
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,530
I have been called worse.

295
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:23,825
No, but I'm glad that you're here.
I'm glad you reached out.

296
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:27,404
It shows a real maturity. And I would know
that because I've never been that mature.

297
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,285
I'm always here for you.

298
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,120
Thank you.

299
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:35,204
I gotta say, I mean, this isn't the same
Arrow team I'm used to seeing.

300
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,255
Or the same Oliver Queen.
You seem really...

301
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,257
- Happy?
- Hapr>y. Yeah.

302
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,174
I am happy. I finally have everything
that I've ever wanted.

303
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:47,803
Being with Felicity has given me
a real sense of peace.

304
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,600
It's something that I haven't had
in a long time.

305
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,641
Didn't you tell me that guys like us
don't get the girl?

306
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:55,015
Yep. I was wrong.

307
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,560
I would like to propose a toast.

308
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:03,656
I wish it wasn't just the dark times
bringing us together.

309
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:09,530
But it is friends like you
that make those dark times worth having.

310
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:12,244
What a guy!
Steals my drink, steals my words.

311
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,371
As I was saying,
it's good to see everyone.

312
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:15,709
- Yes.
- Cheers.

313
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,287
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

314
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,292
Mmm.

315
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,340
Look, don't worry, all right?
We're gonna keep her safe. I promise.

316
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:27,969
Yeah. I know.
Look, there's something I never told you.

317
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,976
The first time I kissed Kendra,
I got a vibe.

318
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:33,853
No, not like that kind of vibe.

319
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,726
- Like I vibed-vibed.
- Oh!

320
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,266
Remember the man with wings?
It wasn't a man.

321
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:39,941
It was Kendra.

322
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:42,065
And she was, like, a bird.

323
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,272
You think that she's a meta-human?

324
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,491
Wait, why didn't you say anything
about this sooner?

325
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:50,320
Well, I didn't think it was related,
but I guess, now, it has to be.

326
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:54,244
Look, I don't, I don't want her
to know about my powers.

327
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:58,336
I have this great thing going with her.

328
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:03,666
And she laughs at myjokes,
and she loves movies, and...

329
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:07,128
I just...
I've never felt like this before,

330
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,963
and I don't want to sabotage it.

331
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,140
I get the feeling.

332
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:13,934
Look!

333
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,935
I will always find you, Chay-Ara.

334
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,480
Don't move!

335
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:27,941
Then how will I kill you all?

336
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:03,192
Yeah, I can do that too.

337
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,489
Thea, no!

338
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:24,796
What did you do?

339
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,419
I ended it.

340
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:30,591
This is why we ask questions!

341
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:40,601
- Where did he go? Oh, boy.
- Oh, boy.

342
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,194
Okay. Thanks.

343
00:19:55,319 --> 00:20:00,120
All right. Lance is gonna call if he gets
any information on whoever that is.

344
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,207
I know where we can get some info.

345
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:11,461
Kendra, I have powers.

346
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:17,092
I get these vibes from people,
they're visions of meta-humans.

347
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:20,432
And I had one of you.

348
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:25,813
So, A, you're saying you're a meta-human,
and B, she's a meta-human?

349
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:29,730
I don't know. In these visions,
you could fly.

350
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,824
It was like you were a bird of some sort.

351
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,068
- A bird?
- Yeah.

352
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,325
What else did you see?

353
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:41,825
That's it. Just you with wings.

354
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:44,790
Oh! I did not see that one coming.

355
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,842
Oh, I think there's a lot
you didn't see coming.

356
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:56,013
Great. More surprises.
Who the hell is this?

357
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,681
That's my dad.

358
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,269
I think I did it.

359
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,987
What do you know, Snow.
I think you did do it.

360
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,365
- Velocity-Six?
- Ah!

361
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,999
This is what was so urgent, Harrison?

362
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,703
You get me to come here
so I can take your speed drug?

363
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:29,205
- That's right.
- You knew about this?

364
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:31,878
- Of course she did. She figured it out.
- Uh...

365
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,218
I thought this was to help Barry.

366
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:37,338
It is to help Barry. Which is why we need
to do test runs on subjects

367
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,719
who once had the Speed Force
in their system.

368
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:41,517
Speed Force doesn't work like that.

369
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,061
It's not something
you can create in a lab.

370
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,055
How do you think you became
the Flash, Garrick?

371
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:50,853
By me and a lab. Science is what
did this to you, to Barry, to Zoom.

372
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,984
And science is what we need to stop Zoom,
and this is our only option.

373
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:57,067
Find another one! Speed Force
can't be replicated or enhanced.

374
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,239
It's a living thing.
It's a gift that was given to me.

375
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:01,738
That drug, you have no idea
what it's gonna do.

376
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,536
I'm not letting another one of your
experiments mess with me again.

377
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,037
You find someone else
to be your guinea pig.

378
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:07,539
Jay!

379
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:09,499
Caitlin, keep that serum away from Barry.

380
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:13,545
- Where are you going?
- To pick up what we need.

381
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,922
Wait! Jayjust said
we shouldn't give it to Barry.

382
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,091
We're gonna do what we need.

383
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:24,935
The man you're looking for
is Vandal Savage.

384
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:27,638
- Vandal Savage? Never heard of him.
- Well, who is he?

385
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:29,770
Some say he was the most trusted adviser
to Genghis Khan.

386
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:32,397
Others say he guided Julius Caesar
through the Gallic Wars.

387
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:36,947
But one thing the League knows for sure,
he was there for all of it.

388
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:39,741
So what are you saying?
He's like a vampire or something?

389
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:42,115
Not a vampire. An Immortal.

390
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:46,624
Okay, we've officially stepped
into crazy town. Immortality?

391
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:48,076
But wait, no, no, no. This makes sense.

392
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:51,834
This explains why he looks the same
as he did in 1975.

393
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:53,168
This can't be possible.

394
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,215
There's nothing you can do
to save her now.

395
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:58,795
Kendra, do not listen to him.

396
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:01,639
I just need some air.

397
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:10,598
Hey. We are gonna do whatever we have to
to keep Kendra safe.

398
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,433
Whether you think we can or not.

399
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:13,855
Hey, Joe, it's Patty.

400
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:17,529
I just interviewed a weapons expert
about the flint knife our attacker used.

401
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:21,155
I found out something pretty interesting.
So, call me back.

402
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:28,661
Harrison Wells?

403
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:31,790
Kendra! Hey.

404
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:35,673
- You gonna be all right?
- This is a lot to take in right now.

405
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:37,667
Look, I'm... I'm sorry
I didn't tell you about me before.

406
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:40,879
I didn't want things to be
different between us.

407
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,383
It's not that, Cisco.

408
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:44,386
If what everyone's saying is true,

409
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,890
and it's beginning to seem like it is,
my whole life just changed.

410
00:23:49,303 --> 00:23:51,021
And I am so not ready for that.

411
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:52,939
I hear what you're saying. I do.

412
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:58,188
When I first learned about my powers,

413
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,740
I remember feeling
that exact same feeling.

414
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:03,864
And sometimes, I still feel that way.

415
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:05,365
And all I can say is,

416
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:11,539
every day gets a little bit more normal.

417
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:14,749
I promise you.

418
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:19,546
Thank you.

419
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:20,800
You're so welcome.

420
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,307
- Kendra.
- Let me go!

421
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,062
Guys, did you find anything?

422
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,359
- I'm on it!
- I'm on it!

423
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:43,190
Whoa, whoa, whoa! This is my house.

424
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,942
Don't worry. We're gonna find her.

425
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,078
Wow.
You look as beautiful as ever.

426
00:24:57,997 --> 00:25:00,796
Chay-Ara, it's me, Khufu.

427
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,428
Do you remember? Look at me.

428
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,146
You need to wake up.

429
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,894
What are you talking about?

430
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:18,776
I don't know who you are.

431
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:20,478
You will once you emerge.

432
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:23,405
Until then, you need to stay by my side
so that I can protect you.

433
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,274
Protect me? From what?

434
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:27,951
The man who is hunting you. Vandal Savage.

435
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:30,488
I got 'em! 57th Street tower.

436
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:32,081
I'm right near there.

437
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:34,124
Always a pleasure
watching you work, Smoak.

438
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:35,576
- Yeah!
- Mmm!

439
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:36,876
- Ah!
- That was pitiful.

440
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,294
I know this is a lot to take in,

441
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:40,418
but you sort ofjust
kinda have to trust me on this.

442
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:45,761
I... Just one second.
Stay right there.

443
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:55,353
I got eyes on 'em.

444
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:11,241
Give me the girl!

445
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:12,739
Not gonna do that, Robin Hood.

446
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:15,825
- You're making a big mistake.
- I'll take my chances.

447
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,745
Barry! Change of venue.

448
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:22,797
Birdman and Oliver are at
54th and Motor now. Hurry!

449
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,170
On my way!

450
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:49,362
We need to expose his wings.

451
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:50,738
I'm open to suggestions.

452
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:51,990
What, now you're listening to me?

453
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,199
It's your city, Oliver.

454
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:54,739
All right.

455
00:26:54,763 --> 00:26:56,763
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

456
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,578
That's new.

457
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:44,792
Yeah. Comes in handy.

458
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:52,338
We can't use that serum on Barry.

459
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:54,598
That's up to him, isn't it?

460
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:59,265
If Barry wants to stop Zoom,
this is what he needs.

461
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:00,642
Jay said it could hurt Barry.

462
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:01,938
Well, Jay's a coward.

463
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:04,809
Jay's a scientist
who knows a lot about speedsters.

464
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,064
You're a scientist, Snow.

465
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:09,321
You've been watching Barry, you know
he's nowhere near fast as he needs to be.

466
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,774
This other mentor,
this other Harrison Wells,

467
00:28:11,982 --> 00:28:14,405
did not want him to reach
his full potential. ldo.

468
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,533
You know, you're really starting
to sound a lot like him.

469
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:21,742
Put your hands in the air.

470
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:25,420
- Who are you?
- You're under arrest.

471
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:28,048
Dr. McGee was right. She did see you.

472
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:32,466
- Christina McGee?
- At Mercury Labs. You're Harrison Wells.

473
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:34,838
Yes, I'm Harrison Wells.
I'm not the Harrison Wells...

474
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:36,299
Stop! You move closer and I'll shoot!

475
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:37,632
Give me that...

476
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:50,646
Oh, my God! What have you done?

477
00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:53,737
Harrison! Harrison Wells, stay with me.

478
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:02,079
Harrison. Harrison, stay with me.
Stay with me, Harrison Wells. Come on.

479
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:03,371
Why did you shoot him?

480
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,285
I thought that was a gun.
I'm sorry. I'll call 911.

481
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:06,586
- No! Don't!
- Why?

482
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:08,789
Because this...
Didn't Joe West explain this to you?

483
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,465
- No.
- Just call Joe!

484
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:11,758
Okay.

485
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,316
Where is she?

486
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:29,985
- What's your name?
- You're putting her in danger

487
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:31,903
and I'm the only one
capable of saving her.

488
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:35,449
A very interesting perspective
on what the word "saving" means.

489
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,154
She's the love of my lifetimes,
sweetheart.

490
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,327
I was not gonna hurt her.

491
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:41,405
You need to let me go!

492
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,460
Chay-Ara...

493
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:49,421
My name is Kendra Saunders.

494
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,040
In this life.

495
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:55,253
And I am, was Carter Hall.
But that is not who we are.

496
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,053
What does that mean?

497
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,840
You're Priestess Chay-Ara,
I'm Prince Khufu.

498
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,676
And we're lovers, soul mates.

499
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:05,262
We've been partners
for 4,000 years.

500
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,188
We're drawn to each other in each life,
and after we die,

501
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:10,351
we reincarnate to find each other again,
and again, and again.

502
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,937
And now that I've found you,
we should really get out of here.

503
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:15,193
Okay, Romeo,
why don't you pump the brakes?

504
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,533
These people cannot protect you
from Savage any longer.

505
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:20,407
D0 you know who Vandal Savage is?

506
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:25,662
In every lifetime,
he hunts us down and kills us.

507
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,997
He's done it 206 times.

508
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,874
And I'm not planning to make it 207.

509
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:31,580
Why does he kill you?

510
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,582
His life force is tethered to ours.

511
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:37,590
Every time he kills us,
he becomes more powerful. You do the math.

512
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,216
You're 0 for 206,

513
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:41,719
and you still think
you're her best bet, hmm?

514
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:45,097
Okay, so what we need to do
is just find Savage and get rid of him.

515
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:48,605
Well,
you can't get rid of him, my friend.

516
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:50,562
Oh, yeah? Watch us.

517
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:53,231
It might be harder than you think.

518
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:55,904
Is that the only way
this guy knows how to enter a room?

519
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:59,154
My associates tell me
Savage left Star City a few hours ago.

520
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:00,405
For where?

521
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,695
We're not quite sure. But I assume
after his run in with you,

522
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:05,782
he realized he needed something
more powerful to complete his mission.

523
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:07,203
Well...

524
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,534
We think he's trying to locate
the Staff of Horus.

525
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:11,586
Sorry, what is that?

526
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:15,212
It's a relic from our past.
An ancient and powerful weapon.

527
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:20,637
If Savage gets his hands on it, it's gonna
be nearly impossible to stop him.

528
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:23,720
Since when did our lives suddenly become
an Indiana Jones movie?

529
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:26,010
- Felicity? Think you can find it?
- Yeah.

530
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:27,686
Yes. It's probably at some
museum somewhere.

531
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,605
I'll work my magic.
See what I can find.

532
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,942
We're running out of time.

533
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:37,942
You need to emerge, now. Come on.

534
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:40,274
What is it going to take for you
to believe me? You saw my wings.

535
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,484
I know you know this is true.

536
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:45,074
Please, just let me show you how.

537
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,372
- How's he doing?
- He's losing oxygen.

538
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:56,256
- I need you to leave.
- Joe, I...

539
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:57,673
Patty, go.

540
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,635
There's a bullet in a branch
of his pulmonary artery

541
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:03,430
that's blocking off most of the blood flow
from the left lung.

542
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:04,798
Are we able to get the bullet out?

543
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,679
Not without causing too much damage.

544
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:08,260
I need Jay's help.

545
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,614
So,

546
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:25,527
you just want me to jump?

547
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:29,832
Fall, jump, swan dive,
whatever suits you. Just, do it.

548
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,871
Okay. This isn't the X Games.

549
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,918
And this is how she emerges?

550
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:37,339
She just falls towards her death?

551
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:40,133
Yep. 4,000 years of experience
says that's exactly how.

552
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:41,505
Just watch and learn.

553
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:44,680
No, I'm sorry. What are we doing?
Why are we listening to this guy?

554
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,850
Come on, Oliver. You're supposed to be
the one who asks questions.

555
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:51,223
Okay, but after what we saw,
after what Cisco said,

556
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:53,055
I cannot believe I'm gonna say this,

557
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:56,058
but it kinda makes sense.

558
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,651
Hey, hey, hey.

559
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:07,527
I need to try.

560
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:08,783
Are you serious?

561
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,660
Yes, she is.

562
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:19,919
What the hell was that?

563
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:23,252
Saving her life. You should have emerged.
Something is blocking you.

564
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:24,962
Well, we should just try again
and see...

565
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,638
- No!
- Yeah, no! No, no, no.

566
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:29,015
No. We're not doing that again.
Kendra, you don't have to do this.

567
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:31,677
Oliver, we can stop Savage, okay?

568
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,516
- Barry!
- What?

569
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,561
Can I talk to you for a second?

570
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:39,900
Okay.

571
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:41,398
Keep an eye on him.

572
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:45,990
What is going on with you?

573
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:47,238
I'm trying to keep her alive.

574
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:49,570
- Then I think we let herjump.
- Are you kidding?

575
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:52,577
Barry, I get that you're desperate to help
and you want to be the hero,

576
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:54,078
and you wanna save her yourself.

577
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:56,159
But I think she has to have
a part in it, too.

578
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:01,290
- What?
- Lt'sjust the rules keep changing.

579
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:02,920
One day, I have to run through time,

580
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,001
the next,
I'm fighting a telepathic gorilla.

581
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,553
And now, we're what?

582
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:08,630
We're, we're chasing down
an immortal madman

583
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:11,717
on a rampage against
a reincarnated warrior Priestess?

584
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,266
I Just never thought I'd have superpowers

585
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,724
and feel more powerless
than I ever have in my entire life.

586
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:22,527
That part, I understand.
But you have already helped Kendra.

587
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,525
You have kept her alive.

588
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,238
So now, let's help her get her wings,

589
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:28,817
and then she can give you
a lift back to Central City.

590
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:35,206
- Central City.
- What?

591
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,951
We need to check Central City
for the staff.

592
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,127
- Kendra, you said you were drawn there?
- Yeah.

593
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:41,796
I think you're drawn to things
that destroy you,

594
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:43,465
the same way the two of you
are drawn to each other.

595
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:45,667
That's why it wasn't in any museum
or private collection,

596
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:48,594
because it was consecrated eight months
ago at St. Mark's in Central City.

597
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,342
We've gotta get it before Savage does.

598
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,507
Carter, stay here.

599
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:53,849
I'm not going anywhere.

600
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:57,058
Call Thea and Dig and we'll have them hold
down the fort in case Savage shows up.

601
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,564
Kendra, last year, I lost my powers.

602
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:00,978
The only way I could get them back is

603
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:03,276
if I just forgot about everything
happening around me,

604
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:05,399
and focused on who I was.

605
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:08,653
Just believe in yourself,
and your true selfwill emerge.

606
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:10,366
Thanks.

607
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,903
Hey. Are you sure that
you want to do this?

608
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:17,203
If this guy's immortal and Merlyn's right
about how powerful this staff is...

609
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:21,294
We'll be fine. Kiss her.

610
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,709
We'll be fine.

611
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,384
- Careful.
- Let's go.

612
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:44,814
Now what?

613
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:46,941
His systolic pressure's dropping.
He's gonna code.

614
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,065
How bad is it?

615
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:52,067
There's a bullet in his pulmonary artery.

616
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:55,408
- Can you close the wound if I get it?
- Yes.

617
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:57,080
How are you gonna do that?

618
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:02,119
- What is that?
- Lt's a serum, called Velocity-Six.

619
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:03,704
It could give Jay temporary speed.

620
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:06,131
He can phase through Dr. Wells' chest,
and remove the bullet.

621
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:08,667
Yeah. But I told you, I've no idea
what's gonna happen if I use that.

622
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:09,967
It's our only option.

623
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,091
If you don't do this,
Dr. Wells will die.

624
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:27,027
It's working.

625
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:43,786
BP and oxygenation is rising.
Blood flow's returning to his lungs.

626
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,872
Thank you.

627
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:52,256
I was just thinking,

628
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:56,306
all the moments in my life
when I felt different,

629
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:58,759
like something was wrong with me,

630
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:02,475
now I know why.

631
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:08,022
It's gonna be all right, okay?

632
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:13,983
Look, I know what it's like to have
your life suddenly change like this.

633
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:17,281
I can help you get through this.

634
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:18,987
I don't know if you can.

635
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:23,830
Cisco, there is a whole
other life inside me.

636
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:28,289
Hundreds of lives
that I need to know about.

637
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:32,300
I think I need to do it by myself.

638
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:36,221
I have to embrace my destiny.

639
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:38,594
I have to believe.

640
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:42,685
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

641
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:46,140
You don't have to do this.

642
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:53,692
What's going on?

643
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:56,525
Nothing. I just like to speed
into rooms, usually.

644
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:58,451
Uh-huh. And where do you think
we find this thing?

645
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:01,204
I haven't been in
one of these places in a while.

646
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:05,830
We're too late.

647
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:09,834
Something you're not used to
saying very often, I'd imagine.

648
00:38:11,331 --> 00:38:13,675
You tried those arrows
once before, remember?

649
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:16,298
They didn't quite finish the job,
now did they?

650
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:18,176
I'm not gonna make that mistake again.

651
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:19,631
You're gonna leave Kendra alone.

652
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,843
I can't do that.
While my destiny is to live forever,

653
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:25,895
Chay-Ara's is to die, as is yours now.

654
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:42,362
- Any ideas?
- Oh, now you'll listen to me?

655
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,913
It's your city.

656
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:51,504
- Let's just try to get the staff.
- All right.

657
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,419
- On my mark.
- All right.

658
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:00,054
Carter was right.
Something's holding me back.

659
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:02,257
Maybe it's Central City, or you.

660
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:03,933
Or what I thought my life was going to be.

661
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:06,602
But I'm never gonna become
who I really am unless I let go.

662
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:08,645
I have to do this.

663
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:20,909
In all my countless years,
I've never encountered

664
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:24,704
anybody with your capabilities.
Astonishing!

665
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,157
No!

666
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:37,171
Chay-Ara...

667
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:39,799
on, my God!

668
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:47,720
I used to enjoy slow deaths.
Now, I Just find them boring.

669
00:39:57,979 --> 00:39:59,606
Thanks.

670
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:01,566
Yeah. Any chance he blew
himself up in there?

671
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:02,821
Not likely.

672
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:04,657
So that's like a tie, right?

673
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:06,738
- I guess.
- I will take it.

674
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:24,760
Hey,. are you okay?

675
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:26,679
I'm gonna have to learn
how to use these things.

676
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:31,061
You'll get the hang of it, Hawkgirl.

677
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:42,236
Dr. Wells, you're gonna be okay.

678
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:45,485
That's good news.

679
00:40:46,486 --> 00:40:49,706
You will probably be very sore
for a little while, though.

680
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:51,745
Sore's better than dead.

681
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,209
Yes, it is.

682
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:01,000
How you doing, Garrick?

683
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:03,754
Your serum's out of my system.

684
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:06,259
And I will never take it again.

685
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:14,138
Jay.

686
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:18,063
Thank you.

687
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:22,192
You can thank me by keeping
that Velocity-Six away from Barry.

688
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:34,534
That was Oliver.
Savage has the Staff of Horus.

689
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:37,370
He wants us all in Central City
as soon as possible.

690
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:39,501
Okay, well, Laurel's already
there visiting her mom,

691
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:41,708
so I'll call her and let her know
we're coming by.

692
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:45,090
If Savage is in Central City,
then why are we going back there?

693
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:46,386
So we can end this.

694
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:49,261
And if anybody's gonna take down Savage,
it's gonna be Barry and Oliver.

695
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,593
Plus, you've emerged.
It's gonna be much harder for him now.

696
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:54,145
And together, all of us,
we can take him down once and for all.

697
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:57,064
Okay. So how are we gonna get there?

698
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:01,232
Did I mention I'm the CEO
of a big company with a private jet?

699
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,703
Since when is that a thing?

700
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:15,909
About eight months.

701
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,961
Maybe if you save Star City,
you might get one, too.

702
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:22,503
By the way, we still need to get Savage.

703
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:24,125
We'll get him.

704
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:28,763
Watch yourself, buddy.

705
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:35,265
- Don't want to lose this guy.
- Thanks, mister.

706
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,143
Yeah.

707
00:42:37,167 --> 00:42:45,167
