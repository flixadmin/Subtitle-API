00:00:01,635 --> 00:00:05,170
<i>In 2166, an immortal madman
named Vandal Savage</i>

3
00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:07,672
<i>conquered the world and
murdered my wife and child.</i>

4
00:00:07,675 --> 00:00:10,642
<i>I have assembled an elite team
to hunt him throughout time</i>

5
00:00:10,644 --> 00:00:11,910
<i>and stop his rise to power.</i>

6
00:00:11,912 --> 00:00:14,046
<i>Unfortunately,
my plan is opposed</i>

7
00:00:14,048 --> 00:00:16,315
<i>by the body
I'd sworn my allegiance to,</i>

8
00:00:16,317 --> 00:00:17,716
<i>The Time Masters.</i>

9
00:00:17,718 --> 00:00:20,218
<i>In the future,
my friends may not be heroes,</i>

10
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,620
<i>but if we succeed,</i>

11
00:00:21,622 --> 00:00:25,524
<i>they will be remembered
as legends.</i>

12
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,927
<i>Previously
on "Legends of Tomorrow"...</i>

13
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:30,362
I'm a Time Master,

14
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,764
making discrete alterations
to the timeline is what I do.

15
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:34,499
Half of what
you told us about the mission

16
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:36,201
turned out to be lies.

17
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:40,005
<i>Lewis smart, convicted
of larceny, armed robbery.</i>

18
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:43,442
<i>You and your entire family
are criminals.</i>

19
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:45,811
<i>Things are complicated
with family.</i>

20
00:00:45,813 --> 00:00:47,612
<i>The Lazarus Pit
brought me back,</i>

21
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:50,282
<i>but it left me with
this need to kill.</i>

22
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:52,351
<i>You're Princess Chay-Ara,
I'm Prince Khufu,</i>

23
00:00:52,353 --> 00:00:53,452
<i>and we're lovers.</i>

24
00:00:53,454 --> 00:00:54,753
I know you're worth the wait.

25
00:00:57,324 --> 00:00:59,024
Aah!

26
00:00:59,026 --> 00:01:00,659
<i>Well, I say
we kick Savage's ass</i>

27
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:02,427
- For Carter.
- For Carter.

28
00:01:33,127 --> 00:01:35,894
Ah!

29
00:01:37,498 --> 00:01:39,030
Who are you?

30
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,270
The man who's here
to kill you.

31
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,148
<i>We've arrived
in Leipzig, Germany,</i>

32
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,216
<i>the most current location
for Vandal Savage.</i>

33
00:01:58,218 --> 00:01:59,651
<i>And by the way, Captain,</i>

34
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:02,087
<i>you are are urgently needed
in the medbay.</i>

35
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:04,523
- I thought she'd stabilized.
- As did I.

36
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:11,830
Carter!
Where's Carter?

37
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:13,999
He's gone, Kendra.
I'm so sorry.

38
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:16,635
Gideon,
turn that bloody noise off!

39
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,069
<i>- Yes, Captain.</i>
- What happened?

40
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,938
Saunders appears
to have had a complication.

41
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,640
Ye... I know, what kind of
complication?

42
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:24,709
How could you leave him?

43
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:26,945
- Is she...
- Medbay gave her a sedative,

44
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:31,917
But obviously her condition
is worsening.

45
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:34,219
Pieces of the dagger
have apparently broken off

46
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:37,422
and are, as we speak,
en route to her heart.

47
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:38,724
Can't we just time jump
into the future

48
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:40,392
where they got the stuff
that can fix her?

49
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:42,828
This ship is from that very
same future and has, thus far,

50
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,229
been unsuccessful in saving her.

51
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:47,599
Kendra wouldn't survive
the time jump anyway.

52
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:49,267
I pay attention.

53
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:50,702
To sum up,
Carter Hall is dead,

54
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:52,637
the girlfriend's
not too far behind,

55
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,174
Vandal Savage
is sitting pretty in 1975,

56
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,542
which we're all stuck in.

57
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:59,878
That how the plan
supposed to work, Rip?

58
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,581
Obviously not,
but the mission is simple.

59
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:05,550
We stop Vandal Savage
here in the past

60
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:06,952
and we save the future.

61
00:03:06,954 --> 00:03:08,487
Simple don't mean easy,
Captain.

62
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:10,055
Oh, I never said it was.

63
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:11,723
The benefit of being a
Time Master is that

64
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:14,825
the length and breadth
of history gives one...

65
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:16,828
perspective.

66
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,064
I've seen darker days.

67
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,768
I've seen men of steel die
and dark knights fall,

68
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:28,473
and even then I accomplished
my mission no matter what.

69
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:30,742
Gideon, what is our status?

70
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:33,311
<i>When the Waverider was
attacked by Chronos,</i>

71
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:34,813
<i>the jumpship was damaged.</i>

72
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:36,681
<i>Unless you make repairs,
we will be unable to...</i>

73
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:38,450
Wait, jumpship?

74
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:39,784
It's a small
expeditionary vessel

75
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:41,152
at the belly of the Waverider...

76
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:42,320
You're a mechanic!

77
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:43,455
You have a look at it.

78
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:45,690
Uh... auto mechanic.

79
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:48,627
Uh... Spaceship.

80
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:52,597
Okay, if you've got a set
of wrenches,

81
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,932
I'll see what I can do.

82
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:57,168
What about the rest of us?
Do we just sit?

83
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,670
Capital idea, Mr. Rory.

84
00:03:58,672 --> 00:04:01,239
You're not nearly as thick
as most people say.

85
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,275
Thick...

86
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:05,277
Does that mean stupid?

87
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:14,486
Is that your son?
He looks like you.

88
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:15,487
Sorry.

89
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:16,888
Trained by league of assassins,

90
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,623
Sneaking up on people
is kind of our thing.

91
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,592
I'd like to be alone
for a moment.

92
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:23,128
You don't actually have
a plan, do you?

93
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,097
And that speech wasn't
about convincing us.

94
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,934
It was about convincing you.
Didn't work, did it?

95
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:32,837
Not particularly, no.
Hence my desire to be alone.

96
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:35,073
So we can't kill Savage.

97
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:37,175
Oh, I see you've grasped
the concept of immortality,

98
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:40,078
- Well done.
- Maybe we could slow him down.

99
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,280
Now, Ra's Al Ghul
taught me a thing or two

100
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,783
About fighting
powerful adversaries.

101
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:47,018
If you can't kill your enemy,
weaken him.

102
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,487
If you can't cut off his head,

103
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:51,356
Take his heart.

104
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:54,626
Mr. Al Ghul was quite
the poet.

105
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,094
Back at the weapons auction,

106
00:04:56,096 --> 00:05:00,632
Savage was trying
to<i> sell</i> his nuke.

107
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,334
Money is power.

108
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:05,537
Take away Savage's fortune
and he's just a regular guy

109
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:06,972
With a really long lifespan.

110
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:09,474
It certainly would set
his plan for world domination

111
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,042
Back a few decades.

112
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:15,480
So where does Vandal Savage
keep his money in 1975?

113
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:16,948
The broken knife fragments

114
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,850
Are moving through her
circulatory system,

115
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:20,218
And if you'll notice these,

116
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,320
They're closing
in towards her heart.

117
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,455
So what do we do?

118
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:24,689
The fragments are miniscule.

119
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:26,024
Even the ship's technology

120
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:27,859
Isn't capable
of neutralizing them.

121
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:31,196
Fortunately, there's
a technology onboard that is.

122
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:32,464
The A.T.O.M. suit.

123
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:34,933
I can shrink down,
slip into her bloodstream,

124
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:36,968
And use the photon canons
to vaporize the knife fragments.

125
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,503
You'll be pushing
the suit's limits.

126
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:39,738
We should run some tests,

127
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,139
Make sure this is
the best plan of action.

128
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:42,774
This isn't the ivory tower,
Professor.

129
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:44,442
We don't have time...
listen to me, Raymond.

130
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:46,144
- I'm not your student anymore.
- You were never my student!

131
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:47,412
Just because you don't
remember me...

132
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:48,580
If you had been my student,

133
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:49,914
I'd have taught you
the principles

134
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,684
Of using scientific analysis,
not this bravado.

135
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:55,786
There isn't time.
I'm going in.

136
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:01,660
Gideon!
Where's Savage's money now?

137
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:04,195
Dr. Boardman theorized
that Savage entrusted it

138
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:07,332
To the Brüemberg group,
the oldest bank in the world.

139
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:08,733
I'll go tell
the rest of the team.

140
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:10,568
That won't be necessary.

141
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,271
I'm going alone.

142
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:15,306
I can't have any more blood
on my hands.

143
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:16,675
Except for your own?

144
00:06:16,677 --> 00:06:18,410
You can't go in there
without backup.

145
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:22,781
Look, I brought you all
with me under false pretenses.

146
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:24,015
Carter would still be alive

147
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:25,984
If I hadn't have
convinced him to come.

148
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:27,919
No one's on this ship
that doesn't want to be here.

149
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:29,788
But I can't risk
the whole team.

150
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,090
Fine. Just me.

151
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:33,858
And if it helps,
I'm not giving you a choice.

152
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,226
I'm going with you to that bank.

153
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,428
Somebody say bank?

154
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,430
Your services aren't required,
Mr. Snart.

155
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:39,631
This is purely reconnaissance.

156
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:41,733
We know how to case banks.

157
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,134
We're practically bankers.

158
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:44,836
'Cept we take the money out.

159
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:46,838
Yes, and when I need someone
to steal something,

160
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,540
You'll be the first to know,
I assure you.

161
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:50,008
Listen, Englishman.

162
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:53,311
I'm getting bored being stuck
on this tin can.

163
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:55,413
And when I get bored,
I make bad decisions.

164
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,650
Now, now, now,
we're all on the same side here.

165
00:06:58,652 --> 00:07:00,852
My hot-headed friend
and I just want to be helpful.

166
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:04,322
- That's all.
- Duly noted.

167
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:10,061
You should have let me
punch him.

168
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:13,565
Yeah, then we wouldn't have
gotten this.

169
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,433
Hm.

170
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,102
You ready?

171
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:18,636
Yes.

172
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:41,860
All right,
where am I headed?

173
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:43,294
You're exiting
the tracheal artery.

174
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,796
You should see
the first fragment.

175
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:45,797
<i>No sign of it.</i>

176
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:46,931
<i>Did I miss it?</i>

177
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:48,266
It's the size of an iceberg.

178
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:50,168
It seems highly unlikely
that you could miss it.

179
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,050
That's probably what they said
on the Titanic.

180
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,507
Think I found it.

181
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:57,075
Looks like all those years
of playing "asteroids"

182
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:59,711
Is about to pay off.

183
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:08,186
Her vitals are improving.
It seems to be working.

184
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,394
There's still 19 more
fragments.

185
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:18,129
<i>Raymond?</i>

186
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:20,965
<i>Raymond, you're not done!</i>

187
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:22,367
I'm losing core containment.

188
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:25,170
Plot me a course out of here.
Now!

189
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,743
<i>♪ Ha! ♪</i>

00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:47,992
Excuse me.

197
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:49,861
We'd like to deposit
some family heirlooms.

198
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,130
I'm sorry,
we're a private bank.

199
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:55,099
We don't secure valuables
worth less than $10 million.

200
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:56,901
Well,
I'm sure this will suffice.

201
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:01,372
Doubloons from the wreck
of the "Esplinade".

202
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,775
They've been appraised
at $10 million dollars...

203
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:05,109
Apiece.

204
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:07,645
<i>♪ Fight the power ♪</i>

205
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:09,781
<i>♪ fight it ♪</i>

206
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:11,516
Such a pleasure.

207
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:13,551
You won't regret your decision.

208
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,721
The Brüemberg group
is known for its discretion.

209
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,890
I'm sure there'll be a fair
deal of paperwork to sign.

210
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,091
Not too much.

211
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:21,559
We like to cut through
the red tape here.

212
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,062
Let me get this to one
of our safe deposit boxes,

213
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,698
And I'll get my secretary
to move in on this paperwork.

214
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,677
Interesting.

215
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,045
There are records here referring

216
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:42,714
to something called
the "vessel".

217
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:44,382
We have a problem.

218
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:46,084
Yes, I know, none of Savage's
funds are in this bank.

219
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,852
I'm working
on locating this "vessel",

220
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:50,421
But I'm not sure I'll do so
before our new friend returns.

221
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,123
To kill us.

222
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,525
The receptionist had a silenced
Beretta under her desk.

223
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:56,361
<i>The guards,
south African mercenaries.</i>

224
00:09:56,363 --> 00:09:58,529
<i>You can tell by the initiation
burns on their neck.</i>

225
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:01,299
And our new friend here has
calluses on his right hand

226
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:03,568
Consistent with being
kuroda-trained swordsmen.

227
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,702
How do you know?

228
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:06,037
Because I have
the same calluses.

229
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,772
Which means
they've probably figured out

230
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,307
That we are not Rockefellers

231
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:10,942
Who just came
into their inheritance.

232
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,443
Oh, don't be so alarmist.

233
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,045
Calluses are hardly definitive
proof of anything.

234
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:16,080
Pretty sure they made us.

235
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,420
Well, if this is how
you treat your customers,

236
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:24,622
We might just have to take
our business elsewhere.

237
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,127
I thought I specifically
said no weapons!

238
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:32,096
You can thank me later.

00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:46,945

Sara.

250
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:14,138
Sara!
Sara, don't!

251
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,573
We didn't get anything
from the computer!

252
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:16,708
We need him alive!

253
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:38,796
What the hell happened
back there?

254
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:40,264
You know I'm a killer.

255
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:41,666
That's why you put me
in your little group.

256
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:43,634
I didn't witness
just a killer at work, Sara.

257
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:45,036
What I saw was an animal.

258
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,705
You are the last person
on this ship to judge anyone!

259
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:51,275
This is not judgment, Sara.
It is concern.

260
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,346
I thought you knew
how I was resurrected

261
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:57,815
And... and what it did to me.

262
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:59,017
I know you were restored

263
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:00,318
By something called
the Lazarus Pit.

264
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,819
Well,
apparently there's a downside

265
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:05,023
To being brought back to life.

266
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:08,760
My friend Thea
calls it a blood lust,

267
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:12,263
And I think that's being too
generous,

268
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:15,066
And so is calling me an animal.

269
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:18,302
I'm a monster.

270
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:25,243
Ha! Nice ride!

271
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,078
Yeah, it can
hit a mach 3 in a walk.

272
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,312
Pretty cool.

273
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:29,714
How'd you know
so much about it?

274
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:32,617
Little thing called
an instruction manual.

275
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:34,952
Did you read the part
about how to fly this thing?

276
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:37,655
Maybe...
Why?

277
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:39,891
We're gonna take a little
sojourn to Central City.

278
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:41,259
There's a priceless jewel

279
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,461
That needs
to be freed from captivity.

280
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:45,730
You want me to
help you steal something?

281
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:47,131
Nah, man.
I'll pass.

282
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,934
Not exactly asking, Jax.

283
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,336
Wow. Carter is dead,

284
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:54,072
Kendra is this close
to joining him,

285
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:55,606
And Vandal Savage is still alive

286
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,341
And out there
doing god knows what,

287
00:12:57,343 --> 00:13:00,044
And all you can think
about is stealing some diamond?

288
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:01,712
It's an emerald.

289
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:04,549
Is there anything you think
about other than yourself?

290
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:06,584
Yes. Money.

291
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:10,455
Nah. I'm not helping
you guys steal anything.

292
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,423
So if you want to shoot me,
then shoot me.

293
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:14,892
- Can I shoot him?
- You got a pair on you, kid.

294
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,260
I respect that.

295
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:18,196
So no shooting...

296
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:21,299
Look, you don't actually have
to help us<i> steal</i> anything.

297
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,167
We just need to get
to Central City.

298
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:27,438
We'll be there and back before
anyone knows we're even gone.

299
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,208
Man, even if I wanted to help,
and I'm not saying that I do,

300
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:33,377
This thing's got
a security lockout.

301
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:35,980
We need an access key.

302
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:39,050
You can't tell me you don't
wanna see what this baby can do.

303
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,423
I believe I've determined
a way to more efficiently

304
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:48,159
Track the fragments still
inside Ms. Saunders body.

305
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,961
Next time you'll
be better prepared.

306
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:51,295
There won't be a next time.

307
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:52,730
Can't you fix the suit?

308
00:13:52,732 --> 00:13:54,365
It's not the suit.

309
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:57,034
Raymond,
you... you mustn't be discouraged.

310
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:58,236
We're scientists.

311
00:13:58,238 --> 00:14:00,705
We learn from failure,
and we keep going.

312
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:02,807
Kendra isn't a lab experiment.
She's a person.

313
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:04,408
I know.

314
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:08,212
You need to have confidence
this will work.

315
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:11,149
Well, I don't.
I can't save her.

316
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:12,783
Based on what evidence?

317
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:15,386
Are we not empirical thinkers,
Dr. Palmer?

318
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:17,588
Exactly how many people
have you lost?

319
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:21,859
One.

320
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,930
Who did you lose?

321
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:27,932
Someone close to you?

322
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:33,271
Who was she, Raymond?

323
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:34,839
For someone who doesn't
remember me,

324
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:38,176
You sure have a lot of personal
observations to offer.

325
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:43,781
Fine, don't talk to me,

326
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:46,684
But fix the suit.

327
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:49,253
It's the only chance
that poor girl has.

328
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:02,366
I'm gonna make this very
simple for you, Mr. Blake.

329
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:05,269
You tell me where Vandal Savage
is hiding his fortune

330
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:07,905
And we will let you
leave here unmolested.

331
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,441
Vandal Savage...

332
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:13,544
Is that the name
you know him by?

333
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:16,180
Let's assume so, yes.

334
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:18,082
And what is your name?

335
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,184
Gareeb?

336
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:22,587
- Will you give us a moment?
- Gareeb?

337
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,956
It's a legend passed down
for 4,000 years.

338
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,157
When my master was first

339
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,959
Bestowed the gift
of eternal life,

340
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:29,827
<i>An enemy tried to kill him.</i>

341
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:33,798
<i>Every myth has its monster,
its devil.</i>

342
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,201
For those of our order,
it's him, the Gareeb.

343
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:38,502
I'd stop talking now
if I were you, mate.

344
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:40,238
If I were you, I'd run.

345
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,607
Your friend has already failed
to kill my master once.

346
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:45,142
He won't be able to protect you.

347
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:47,545
In fact, I highly doubt

348
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:49,180
He's ever been able
to protect anyone.

349
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:00,157
What did he mean you already
tried to kill Savage?

350
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,225
Leave it be, Sara.

351
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:02,994
No, if you want us
to do this...

352
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:04,395
Yes, okay!

353
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:05,763
Yes, I-I had the chance
to kill Savage once before.

354
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:08,332
I had him dead to rights
and I hesitated.

355
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:30,121
Get off me!
Aah!

356
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:33,024
I asked you a question.

357
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:35,926
Who are you, Gareeb?

358
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,463
Killing is never easy,

359
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:41,532
Especially for a good man.

360
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:43,567
But the man killed
my wife and son

361
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,236
And god knows how many other
wives and sons,

362
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:47,638
And yet I couldn't...

363
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,474
Your killing people doesn't make
you a monster, Sara,

364
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:52,443
But having the chance
to avenge your family

365
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:55,880
And not taking it...

366
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:57,882
That does.

367
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:31,082
Let's try this again.

368
00:17:31,084 --> 00:17:33,617
Back for more.

369
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:36,520
Where's Savage's fortune?
Now, I'm particularly interested

370
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:38,022
in this thing called
the "vessel".

371
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:42,693
The vessel is my master's
most treasured possession.

372
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:44,595
Excellent,
and where can we find it?

373
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:46,030
The Greyhill building.

374
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:48,866
There's a gathering tonight
in celebration of it.

375
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:52,703
And clearly you want us to go
so we can get ourselves killed.

376
00:17:52,705 --> 00:17:55,573
- Clearly.
- What is the vessel?

377
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,341
It's the remains
of Prince Khufu

378
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:58,576
Of the middle kingdom.

379
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:01,379
I believe you know him
as Carter Hall.

380
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:07,151
What is Savage going
to do with Carter's body?

381
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:10,121
Well, there's only one way
to find out, isn't there?

382
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:13,124
Gideon,
locate the Greyhill building

383
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:15,659
And set a course.
Wait. We have a plan.

384
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:18,162
Going after Savage's fortune.
Yeah, well, not anymore!

385
00:18:18,164 --> 00:18:21,332
I won't let Carter's remains
be desecrated by that monster.

386
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:23,100
I won't let him win again.

387
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:26,070
And when Kendra wakes up...
and she will wake up,

388
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:27,938
She can give her soul mate
a proper farewell.

389
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,208
Then let us at least go
in with the rest of the team.

390
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,144
Hm.
Gideon!

391
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:35,479
<i>Sir, Mr. Snart, Mr. Rory,
and Mr. Jackson</i>

392
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,448
<i>Are no longer aboard the ship.</i>

393
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,650
That's what I call
a clean heist.

394
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:42,553
And thanks for not setting
the museum on fire, partner.

395
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:45,289
And you, thanks for being
our getaway driver.

396
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,658
Speaking of, let's get
the hell back to the ship.

397
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,593
Oh, one more stop.

398
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:50,728
What're you
talking about, boss?

399
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,097
1629 Handley avenue.

400
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:54,131
What's on Handley avenue?

401
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,000
It's where we grew up.

402
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:58,402
That's why you wanted
to steal the Maximilian Emerald.

403
00:18:58,404 --> 00:18:59,670
Mick, enough.

404
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:00,704
You wanted to give it
to your old man

405
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:01,872
So he wouldn't go to jail

406
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:03,841
Trying to steal it
for himself.

407
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:05,176
Your father was a thief too?

408
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:07,311
And unfortunately,
not a very good one.

409
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,914
Didn't Rip say something about
not messing with the timeline?

410
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:13,083
You could accidentally blink
yourself out of existence.

411
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:14,718
You're screwing
with history here, man.

412
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,888
Yeah, well,
history screwed with me first.

413
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:28,032
I know how it feels.

414
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:29,300
What?

415
00:19:29,302 --> 00:19:30,734
To have a crisis
of confidence.

416
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:34,205
As unlikely as that might seem,
I know.

417
00:19:34,207 --> 00:19:35,739
It was 2002.

418
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:37,508
I was teaching
quantum mechanics

419
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:41,145
And I had one particularly
gifted student.

420
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:44,081
He was able to solve
the Ehrenfest theorem

421
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:47,418
In less than an hour.

422
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,186
He was, quite frankly,
the only student

423
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,287
In all my years of teaching

424
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:54,291
Who ever made me
feel inferior.

425
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:57,761
That student... Was you.

426
00:19:57,763 --> 00:20:00,364
You were exceptional.

427
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:01,632
And suddenly, just like that,

428
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:03,300
You remember having me
in your class.

429
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:04,568
I always remembered.

430
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,770
I just enjoyed taking
you down a peg or two.

431
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:10,040
And why tell me now?

432
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,742
Because I cannot
for the life of me reconcile

433
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:15,212
That cocksure student
I remember with a man

434
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,780
Who believes he doesn't have

435
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:19,750
What it takes
to save Ms. Saunders' life.

436
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:21,819
Who did you lose, Raymond?

437
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:27,424
My fiancée, Anna Loring.

438
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:30,728
She was killed two years ago
in a Starling City siege.

439
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,496
Right in front of me.

440
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:34,732
I couldn't have stopped them.
I couldn't do anything.

441
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:37,434
My leg had been broken.
I couldn't get to her.

442
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:41,305
I could only watch...

443
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:44,208
As they broke her neck.

444
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:47,177
I built this suit because
I promised myself that night

445
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:51,181
That I would never be powerless
to save anyone again.

446
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:53,417
So when a fragment
broke free and damaged my suit,

447
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:57,254
I...
Panicked.

448
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,789
Froze.

449
00:21:00,393 --> 00:21:04,428
Raymond,
you couldn't save Anna,

450
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,464
But you can save Kendra.

451
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:08,866
I believe it.

452
00:21:08,868 --> 00:21:12,937
I believe in that student.

453
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:15,906
I just need him
to believe it too.

454
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,550
Let's do it.

455
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,695
Ah, Mr. Blake.
Welcome.

456
00:21:37,697 --> 00:21:39,964
I take it Mrs. Blake
is out of town?

457
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:46,370
That's a very pointed
observation.

458
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:57,147
If you're going to find
the vessel, you'll need my help.

459
00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:00,551
No, I think we're
quite good without it.

460
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:01,685
Sara.

461
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:51,135
I came down
for a glass of water.

462
00:22:54,607 --> 00:22:57,041
I'm Leo.

463
00:22:57,043 --> 00:23:00,077
Are you friends
with my daddy?

464
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:01,712
Kind of.

465
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:03,414
I think
my daddy's sleeping.

466
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:12,589
Can I tell you something,
Leo?

467
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:16,794
It's important.

468
00:23:16,796 --> 00:23:19,296
Don't ever let anyone hurt you.

469
00:23:19,298 --> 00:23:21,665
Ever.

470
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:23,867
Not here...

471
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:26,336
And especially...

472
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:29,339
Not here.

473
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:33,010
No matter what, you always have
to look out for yourself.

474
00:23:33,012 --> 00:23:34,678
Okay?

475
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,814
You understand?

476
00:23:36,816 --> 00:23:39,016
I think so.

477
00:23:39,018 --> 00:23:41,485
You get the hell away
from my boy, you son of a bitch.

478
00:23:46,459 --> 00:23:49,026
Why don't you
go on up to bed?

479
00:23:49,028 --> 00:23:52,362
Go on.

480
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:08,075
Talk fast,
or you take a bullet.

481
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,747
What're you doing in my home?

482
00:24:09,749 --> 00:24:13,550
A favor for you.

483
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:15,619
Watch it.

484
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:17,421
Relax.

485
00:24:17,423 --> 00:24:18,655
How the hell did you get...

486
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:20,324
Two days from now,
you try to steal this

487
00:24:20,326 --> 00:24:22,993
And you get arrested,
and you spend five years

488
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:25,662
In Iron Heights.
What are you talking about?

489
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:27,197
Cut the crap.

490
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:29,199
We both know if I go down
to the basement right now,

491
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:32,336
I'll find floor plans
for the Central City museum.

492
00:24:32,338 --> 00:24:35,005
Let's just say I've saved
you the trouble...

493
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:37,807
And from being arrested.

494
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,143
How do you know all this?

495
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:40,645
The same way I'll know
if you even think

496
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:43,413
Of raising a hand
to your wife and son.

497
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:45,015
I know who you are.

498
00:24:45,017 --> 00:24:46,717
I know the man you become

499
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:47,985
And it's all I can do to keep

500
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:49,853
From ending you right here,
right now,

501
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:51,021
But if I do,

502
00:24:51,023 --> 00:24:53,423
That means
my sister's never born,

503
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:55,025
So you get a pass.

504
00:24:58,597 --> 00:24:59,963
Your sister?

505
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:06,770
Looks like you didn't write
yourself out of the timeline.

506
00:25:06,772 --> 00:25:08,205
- Looks like.
- But?

507
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:09,506
I don't know,
I just thought maybe things

508
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,941
Would feel differently.

509
00:25:10,943 --> 00:25:13,443
The Englishman says it
takes time for time to change.

510
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:15,078
What were you trying
to change?

511
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,580
My dad was never
father of the year,

512
00:25:16,582 --> 00:25:19,216
But at least he never raised
a hand to any of us.

513
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:22,986
Until he went to prison,
which now he won't.

514
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:24,755
Let's get out of here.

515
00:25:26,926 --> 00:25:29,226
Maybe we should have
had Blake show us around.

516
00:25:29,228 --> 00:25:30,394
Hm.

517
00:25:30,396 --> 00:25:32,062
Perhaps there's
a less conspicuous way

518
00:25:32,064 --> 00:25:34,598
For us to do reconnaissance.

519
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,733
May I?

520
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:38,902
I'm not much of a dancer.

521
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:41,605
I'll lead, then.

522
00:25:51,317 --> 00:25:52,449
Well, for a monster,

523
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:54,885
You dance quite gracefully,
Ms. Lance.

524
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:57,187
- Don't make fun.
- I know, I'm not.

525
00:25:57,189 --> 00:26:00,958
Nor do I consider you
a monster.

526
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,259
All I see is someone
who is tortured

527
00:26:02,261 --> 00:26:04,127
By an appetite
that she cannot control.

528
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:06,563
There's no magical cure
for what's wrong with me.

529
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,131
Of course there is.

530
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:10,801
It's called being better.

531
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:12,169
When my family was killed,

532
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:15,606
I thought there
was no way I could go on,

533
00:26:15,608 --> 00:26:16,607
But I did.

534
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:17,941
The truth of our existence

535
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:19,276
Is that we're
all blessed and cursed

536
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:21,111
With the drive to move forward.

537
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:23,981
Live the next day.

538
00:26:23,983 --> 00:26:26,717
To get better.

539
00:26:26,719 --> 00:26:29,086
And you will too, Sara.

540
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:39,596
Well, maybe I can start by
managing not to kill these guys.

541
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,900
They're scarred up like our
friends at the bank.

542
00:26:42,902 --> 00:26:45,035
South African mercenaries.

543
00:26:45,037 --> 00:26:46,803
Why didn't you say so?

544
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:49,606
Ladies first.

545
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:59,016
This area's restricted,
folks.

546
00:26:59,018 --> 00:27:00,884
I'm just looking
for the ladies' room.

547
00:27:00,886 --> 00:27:03,020
Oh!

548
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,542
Hope you have a plan
to get him out of here.

549
00:27:25,544 --> 00:27:28,178
Yup, there's a maintenance
elevator leads to a loading bay.

550
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,980
I'll have Gideon
fly the Waverider down.

551
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:31,315
I just wish we knew

552
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:33,684
What Savage was gonna do
with Carter's body.

553
00:27:33,686 --> 00:27:35,919
Why not stay and find out?

554
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:37,454
Ah, the Gareeb.

555
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:40,657
Mr. Blake has told us
so much about you.

556
00:27:46,365 --> 00:27:48,699
I've located three fragments.

557
00:27:50,903 --> 00:27:52,536
Okay, I see them.

558
00:27:52,538 --> 00:27:53,837
Damn, they're big.

559
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,472
<i>Remember,
the initial blast will create</i>

560
00:27:55,474 --> 00:27:57,774
Smaller pieces.
You'll need to...

561
00:27:57,776 --> 00:27:59,643
<i>How does Jax put up
with having you in his head?</i>

562
00:27:59,645 --> 00:28:02,212
I believe he finds
my presence rather comforting.

563
00:28:02,214 --> 00:28:04,014
I doubt that very much.

564
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:11,188
Targeting system's overloaded.

565
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,689
Focus, Raymond.

566
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,057
Remember, you can do this.

567
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:15,359
It's not the suit,

568
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:16,994
It's you that Kendra
needs right now.

569
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:27,504
Well done,
just one more fragment to go.

570
00:28:27,506 --> 00:28:29,740
I see it.
It's the biggest one yet.

571
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:38,048
You did it!

572
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:51,294
Well done.

573
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:53,597
I couldn't possibly
be more proud.

574
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:55,799
Well,
maybe if you actually remembered

575
00:28:55,801 --> 00:28:57,634
Me being your student.

576
00:28:57,636 --> 00:28:59,236
Right around
the subclavian artery,

577
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:00,771
I remembered something.

578
00:29:00,773 --> 00:29:02,439
How I figured the solve
to the Ehrenfest theorem...

579
00:29:02,441 --> 00:29:04,841
Two years after
I was in your class.

580
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:07,177
Why did you tell me you
remembered me when you didn't?

581
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:08,779
Because you needed a push.

582
00:29:08,781 --> 00:29:10,580
So all that stuff
about me being exceptional?

583
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,749
Was probably true.

584
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,351
The fact of the matter is,

585
00:29:14,353 --> 00:29:17,187
I had many exceptional students
over the years,

586
00:29:17,189 --> 00:29:19,689
I couldn't possibly
remember them all.

587
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:21,224
I was pretty amazing.

588
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:22,592
If that were true,

589
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,662
I suspect I'd have
given you a higher grade.

590
00:29:25,664 --> 00:29:27,831
I meant tonight.

591
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:30,200
Oh, yes.

592
00:29:30,202 --> 00:29:33,670
On that score,
I cannot disagree.

593
00:29:43,682 --> 00:29:46,083
What're you planning
on doing with Carter's body?

594
00:29:46,085 --> 00:29:47,884
Oh, you'll see.

595
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:49,453
Mr. Blake informs us

596
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:51,488
That you were hoping
to steal our master's fortune,

597
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:53,290
But while money has its uses,

598
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:55,158
It is not the source
of his power.

599
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,359
Then what is?

600
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:59,262
Let us show you.

601
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:01,998
<i>Hym nu setta, rash mun setta.</i>

602
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,568
Our numbers are legion.

603
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:09,339
All drawn to the man
who is immune to death.

604
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:13,110
Wealth is not power...

605
00:30:13,112 --> 00:30:14,611
Belief is.

606
00:30:14,613 --> 00:30:17,814
<i>Hym nu setta, rash mun setta.</i>

607
00:30:29,862 --> 00:30:31,394
Hello, Gareeb.

608
00:30:33,365 --> 00:30:35,065
How long as it been?

609
00:30:35,067 --> 00:30:37,134
4,000 years?

610
00:30:37,136 --> 00:30:38,869
You look well.

611
00:30:46,078 --> 00:30:47,244
When you and your friends

612
00:30:47,246 --> 00:30:49,079
Attacked my estate
in St. Roch.

613
00:30:49,081 --> 00:30:51,348
I was afraid I wouldn't get

614
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,450
The chance
to meet you once again.

615
00:30:53,452 --> 00:30:55,285
Well, if there's something
that I've learned

616
00:30:55,287 --> 00:30:58,321
In 4,000 years...

617
00:30:58,323 --> 00:31:00,857
It's patience.

618
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:04,728
And this time I only had
to wait one short day.

619
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:09,533
You're probably wondering

620
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:12,836
What my plans
are with your friend's body.

621
00:31:12,838 --> 00:31:15,839
I already have
his life's essence,

622
00:31:15,841 --> 00:31:19,476
But his blood still
has its uses.

623
00:31:19,478 --> 00:31:23,580
<i>Hym nu setta, rash mun setta.</i>

624
00:31:23,582 --> 00:31:27,250
Jack the Ripper showed me

625
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:32,289
The virtues of severing
the carotid artery.

626
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:33,790
<i>Hym nu setta.</i>

627
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:37,627
- Ok, what's this now?
<i>- Rash mun setta.</i>

628
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:41,064
<i>hym nu setta, rash mun setta.</i>

629
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:45,235
<i>Hym nu setta, rash mun setta.</i>

630
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:49,506
<i>Hym nu setta, rash mun setta.</i>

631
00:31:49,508 --> 00:31:52,642
<i>Hym nu setta, rash mun setta.</i>

632
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:55,579
Centuries ago,
I discovered that although

633
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:59,816
Immortality is mine alone,

634
00:31:59,818 --> 00:32:04,020
I can share a taste...
With my faithful.

635
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:07,324
Help them live
an extra hundred years or so.

636
00:32:07,326 --> 00:32:12,028
<i>Hym nu setta, rash mun setta.</i>

637
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:16,199
<i>Hym nu setta, rash mun setta.</i>

638
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:20,570
<i>Hym nu setta, rash mun setta.</i>

639
00:32:20,572 --> 00:32:24,741
<i>Hym nu setta...</i>
hum nu setta, rash mun...

640
00:32:24,743 --> 00:32:27,444
they're in trouble.

641
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:28,845
She appears
to be hallucinating.

642
00:32:28,847 --> 00:32:30,947
Rip... Sara...
You have to save them!

643
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,816
Vandal! And Carter!

644
00:32:32,818 --> 00:32:34,017
The Greyhill building!

645
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:36,486
Carter! Rip! Sara!

646
00:32:36,488 --> 00:32:38,855
Gideon,
search "Greyhill building".

647
00:32:38,857 --> 00:32:41,191
<i>I've already searched for it
on behalf of the Captain,</i>

648
00:32:41,193 --> 00:32:42,525
<i>Who's there now
with Ms. Lance.</i>

649
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:44,027
What?
They left without us?

650
00:32:44,029 --> 00:32:45,895
<i>It's a mansion
several miles away.</i>

651
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:47,864
<i>Apparently, there's some sort
of private event.</i>

652
00:32:47,866 --> 00:32:50,100
How the hell could Kendra
know that they're there?

653
00:32:50,102 --> 00:32:52,569
You have to save them!

654
00:32:52,571 --> 00:32:54,537
- What's going on?
- I don't know!

655
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,975
When we first met,

656
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,710
I asked you who you were.

657
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:02,345
Remember?

658
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:04,214
That was the wrong question.

659
00:33:04,216 --> 00:33:07,584
I should have asked you "why?"

660
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:09,552
Why did you seek to kill me?

661
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:12,489
What could I have possibly done
to deserve that hatred

662
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:13,623
I see burning in your eyes.

663
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:16,926
Did I take something from you?

664
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:18,461
Someone?

665
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:27,137
Get your hands off that.

666
00:33:27,139 --> 00:33:31,141
Ah, your wife, I take it.

667
00:33:31,143 --> 00:33:34,043
Oh, she is lovely.

668
00:33:34,046 --> 00:33:36,313
The boy has your eyes.

669
00:33:36,315 --> 00:33:39,516
I will be sure to keep
their picture close.

670
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:42,952
I don't remember killing them...

671
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:45,654
Yet.

672
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:49,757
It seems like I have a lot
to look forward to.

673
00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:52,696
Gideon, get me Jefferson.

674
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:54,264
<i>Mr. Jackson is not aboard.</i>

675
00:33:54,266 --> 00:33:55,999
Oh, don't tell me...

676
00:33:56,001 --> 00:33:57,634
<i>He's with Mr. Snart
and Mr. Rory on the jumpship.</i>

677
00:33:57,636 --> 00:33:59,269
<i>I'm patching you through.</i>

678
00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:00,704
Jefferson?

679
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:03,173
<i>Jefferson, where are you?</i>

680
00:34:03,175 --> 00:34:05,041
Well, it's not a short story.

681
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,010
<i>There's no time!
Gideon will upload you</i>

682
00:34:07,012 --> 00:34:08,745
<i>Coordinates
to the Greyhill building.</i>

683
00:34:08,747 --> 00:34:11,815
Rip and Sara are in danger.

684
00:34:11,817 --> 00:34:14,017
We're on our way,
Professor.

685
00:34:14,019 --> 00:34:15,585
This is a perversion.

686
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:17,821
No, this is the power

687
00:34:17,823 --> 00:34:21,124
You have no hope of defeating.

688
00:34:21,126 --> 00:34:25,962
Everyone here is sworn
to live and die at my command.

689
00:34:25,964 --> 00:34:27,030
Why?

690
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:29,933
'Cause to them, I am a god!

691
00:34:32,104 --> 00:34:33,970
I pity you.

692
00:34:33,972 --> 00:34:36,573
You have no idea what
it's like to have people

693
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:40,977
Willing to follow you up
to the gates of hell!

694
00:34:42,848 --> 00:34:46,783
Actually,
I have a little bit of an idea.

695
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:51,388
Let's get this party started!

696
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:53,390
Here's our invitation!

697
00:34:53,392 --> 00:34:55,392
Aah!

698
00:35:15,647 --> 00:35:17,247
Well, this is different.

699
00:35:17,249 --> 00:35:19,883
I didn't have him pegged
as the "eyes wide shut" type.

700
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:25,588
Aah. Go!
Here!

701
00:35:33,365 --> 00:35:35,465
- You came!
- We're a team!

702
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:37,500
Next time, remember that.

703
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:40,703
Enough!

704
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:44,841
Get Carter's body out of here.

705
00:35:44,843 --> 00:35:47,043
Sara!
I got this.

706
00:36:09,234 --> 00:36:12,569
- Go! I'll deal with Savage.
- Good luck with that.

707
00:36:14,439 --> 00:36:16,639
Ah!

708
00:36:39,231 --> 00:36:42,866
This is for
Miranda and Jonas.

709
00:36:44,503 --> 00:36:46,035
Aah!

710
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:49,672
At least I know
their names now.

711
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:52,475
Miranda and jo...

712
00:36:52,477 --> 00:36:53,910
Jonas.

713
00:36:58,483 --> 00:37:00,683
I will heal...

714
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:04,787
And then I will rise...

715
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:08,057
And I'll simply wait.

716
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:12,262
I am looking forward
to meeting them.

717
00:37:20,272 --> 00:37:22,772
Sara.
Sara.

718
00:37:22,774 --> 00:37:25,008
Sara!

719
00:37:37,155 --> 00:37:39,022
Gideon, I need a check
of the timeline.

720
00:37:39,024 --> 00:37:40,089
Vandal Savage.

721
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,958
<i>The timeline
is unchanged, Captain.</i>

722
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,027
<i>You know better than anyone
that Savage is immortal.</i>

723
00:37:44,029 --> 00:37:45,995
<i>He cannot be killed through
conventional means.</i>

724
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:47,797
Which is why I need you
to work on finding out

725
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:50,133
Where history records
seeing him next.

726
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:51,501
How is she?

727
00:37:51,503 --> 00:37:54,537
Better.

728
00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:56,839
Thank you for what
you did for Carter.

729
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:59,375
Believe me,
it was a team effort.

730
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:01,477
As was, apparently,
your recovery.

731
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:04,113
Well, actually,
I did most of the physical work

732
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:07,250
And Professor was there
for emotional support.

733
00:38:07,252 --> 00:38:08,751
You're welcome.

734
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:10,420
Now, if we could
just figure out a way

735
00:38:10,422 --> 00:38:13,456
To wrest the Amon dagger out
of Savage's hand into yours.

736
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:17,327
I don't think I'm exactly up
to taking him on right now.

737
00:38:17,329 --> 00:38:19,562
No, but you will be...

738
00:38:19,564 --> 00:38:22,265
And we'll help you get ready.

739
00:38:28,607 --> 00:38:30,740
Maybe you didn't
understand me,

740
00:38:30,742 --> 00:38:33,509
I asked for the new timeline,
Gideon.

741
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:35,078
<i>This is the new timeline.</i>

742
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,080
<i>Two days from now,
your father will be arrested</i>

743
00:38:37,082 --> 00:38:38,815
<i>Trying to sell
the Maximilian Emerald</i>

744
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:40,416
<i>To an undercover police
officer.</i>

745
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:42,118
Stupid son of a bitch.

746
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,120
<i>He'll be sentenced
to five years in Iron Heights.</i>

747
00:38:44,122 --> 00:38:48,491
<i>Despite your intervention,
his future remains unchanged.</i>

748
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:51,961
Hey, you tried to save him.

749
00:38:51,963 --> 00:38:54,330
That's got to count
for something.

750
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:57,233
Turns out it doesn't.

751
00:38:57,235 --> 00:39:01,237
- Come on.
- Where are we going now?

752
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:03,106
To say good-bye.

753
00:39:12,317 --> 00:39:16,386
The other day, I tried to find
some words of inspiration.

754
00:39:16,388 --> 00:39:21,424
Words that would restore hope
to us in the wake of our losses,

755
00:39:21,426 --> 00:39:25,895
But it is all of you
who have inspired me.

756
00:39:25,897 --> 00:39:27,563
Beginning with
Professor Boardman

757
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:28,698
And then with Carter,

758
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:32,669
Their heroism is...

759
00:39:32,671 --> 00:39:34,437
An inspiration to us all.

760
00:39:34,439 --> 00:39:38,007
And a reminder
that one person acting alone

761
00:39:38,009 --> 00:39:39,709
Can't save the world.

762
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,407
Come back to me.

763
00:40:16,181 --> 00:40:18,448
Thank you.

764
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:20,216
Both of you.

765
00:40:20,218 --> 00:40:23,086
We're sorry for your loss,
Kendra.

766
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:30,326
I believe
Anna would be proud.

767
00:40:30,328 --> 00:40:32,061
As am I.

768
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:40,203
Gideon,
ready us for take off.

769
00:40:40,205 --> 00:40:41,838
Whoa, are we being chased
or something?

770
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,539
No, but I imagine
that right about now,

771
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:46,509
The museum has realized that
their prized emerald is missing.

772
00:40:46,511 --> 00:40:47,877
You want me to say I'm sorry?

773
00:40:47,879 --> 00:40:49,979
Sorry, I don't do sorry.

774
00:40:49,981 --> 00:40:52,048
Which is fine, Mr. Rory,

775
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:54,751
Because you are owed
the apology.

776
00:40:54,753 --> 00:40:55,985
I should have told
you all before

777
00:40:55,987 --> 00:40:57,453
That this wasn't
my first attempt

778
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,856
To vanquish Vandal Savage,

779
00:40:59,858 --> 00:41:01,357
But the reason I failed before...

780
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:03,459
Was because you
didn't have all of us.

781
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,962
Obviously Dr. Palmer
and I had our hands full

782
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:07,330
Tending to Ms. Saunders,

783
00:41:07,332 --> 00:41:09,098
But now that she's back
on her feet...

784
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,366
We're back to full strength.

785
00:41:10,368 --> 00:41:14,403
Or as strong as
we can be without Carter.

786
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:16,072
Quite true,

787
00:41:16,074 --> 00:41:19,108
But there is no point
in us continuing any further.

788
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:24,714
Unless we are all...
and myself included,

789
00:41:24,716 --> 00:41:27,283
Committed to working in concert.

790
00:41:27,285 --> 00:41:29,452
You don't ditch us,
we won't ditch you.

791
00:41:29,454 --> 00:41:31,120
Deal?

792
00:41:31,122 --> 00:41:33,222
<i>Sir, I've completed
my review of the timeline.</i>

793
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:35,892
<i>I calculate a 98% likelihood</i>

794
00:41:35,894 --> 00:41:37,994
<i>That Savage reappears in 1986.</i>

795
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:39,829
Chart a course, Gideon.

796
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:42,098
Guess we're headed
to the '80s.

797
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,900
Better break out
your parachute pants.

798
00:41:43,902 --> 00:41:46,869
What the hell
are parachute pants?
