1
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,500
"Summoned to court
to answer for the crimes

2
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:09,750
"of your bannerman Gregor Clegane,
the Mountain. " Er...

3
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:14,500
"Arrive within the fortnight
or be branded an enemy of the crown. "

4
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,300
Poor Ned Stark.

5
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,930
Brave man, terrible judgment.

6
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,180
Attacking him was stupid.

7
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,780
Lannisters...

8
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,450
don't act like fools.

9
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,500
Are you going to say something clever?

10
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,370
Go on, say something clever.

11
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,420
Catelyn Stark took my brother.

12
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,010
- Why is he still alive?
- Tyrion?

13
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,760
Ned Stark.

14
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,640
One of our men interfered,

15
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:11,020
speared him through the leg
before I could finish him.

16
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,230
Why is he still alive?

17
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,400
It wouldn't have been clean.

18
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,900
Clean.

19
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:24,320
You spend too much time worrying
about what other people think of you.

20
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,450
I could care less
what anyone thinks of me.

21
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,620
That's what you want
people to think of you.

22
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,910
It's the truth.

23
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,830
When you hear them whispering
"kingslayer" behind your back,

24
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,920
doesn't it bother you?

25
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,300
Of course it bothers me.

26
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,300
A lion doesn't concern himself

27
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,390
with the opinions of the sheep.

28
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,560
I suppose I should be grateful
that your vanity

29
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,730
got in the way
of your recklessness.

30
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,940
I'm giving you half of our forces -

31
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,480
30,000 men.

32
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:03,320
You will bring them to Catelyn Stark's
girlhood home

33
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,820
and remind her that Lannisters

34
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,870
pay their debts.

35
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:12,080
I didn't realize you placed such
a high value on my brother's life.

36
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,670
He's a Lannister.

37
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:18,090
He might be the lowest of the Lannisters,
but he's one of us.

38
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:20,670
And every day that he remains a prisoner,

39
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,670
the less our name commands respect.

40
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,840
So the lion does concern himself
with the opinions of...

41
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,390
No, that's not an opinion. It's a fact.

42
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:33,310
If another house
can seize one of our own

43
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,020
and hold him captive with impunity,

44
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,400
we are no longer a house to be feared.

45
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,030
Your mother's dead.

46
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,240
Before long I'll be dead.

47
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,160
And you...

48
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,450
and your brother
and your sister

49
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,080
and all of her children.

50
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:57,460
All of us dead,
all of us rotting in the ground.

51
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:01,050
It's the family name that lives on.

52
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,550
It's all that lives on.

53
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,720
Not your personal glory,
not your honor,

54
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,680
but family.

55
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,850
Do you understand?

56
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,850
Hmm.

57
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,780
You're blessed with abilities
that few men possess.

58
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:31,030
You're blessed to belong to the most
powerful family in the Kingdoms.

59
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,910
And you're still blessed with youth.

60
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,420
And what have you done
with these blessings, huh?

61
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:41,040
You've served as a glorified
bodyguard for two kings -

62
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:44,590
one a madman,
the other a drunk.

63
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:53,600
The future of our family will be determined
in these next few months.

64
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,770
We could establish a dynasty
that will last a thousand years.

65
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:01,270
Or we could collapse into nothing,
as the Targaryens did.

66
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:08,030
I need you to become the man
you were always meant to be.

67
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:12,280
Not next year. Not tomorrow.

68
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,990
Now.

69
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,940
You're in pain.

70
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,990
I've had worse, my lady.

71
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,370
Perhaps it's time to go home.

72
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,330
The South doesn't seem
to agree with you.

73
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,870
I know the truth Jon Arryn died for.

74
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,880
Do you, Lord Stark?

75
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,460
Is that why you called me here,
to pose me riddles?

76
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,010
Has he done this before?

77
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:17,520
Jaime would have killed him.
My brother is worth a thousand of your friend.

78
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,270
Your brother...

79
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,640
or your lover?

80
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,070
The Targaryens wed brothers
and sisters for 300 years

81
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,690
to keep bloodlines pure.

82
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,860
Jaime and I are more
than brother and sister.

83
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,120
We shared a womb.

84
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,080
We came into this world together.
We belong together.

85
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,080
My son saw you with him.

86
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,050
Do you love your children?

87
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,050
- With all my heart.
- No more than I love mine.

88
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:54,300
- And they're all Jaime's.
- Thank the gods.

89
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:57,970
In the rare event that Robert leaves his whores
for long enough to stumble drunk into my bed,

90
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,890
I finish him off in other ways.

91
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,730
- In the morning, he doesn't remember.
- You've always hated him.

92
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:06,020
Hated him? I worshipped him.

93
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:10,860
Every girl in the Seven Kingdoms dreamed
of him, but he was mine by oath.

94
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,910
And when I finally saw him
on our wedding day in the Sept of Baelor,

95
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:16,740
lean and fierce and black-bearded,

96
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:19,030
it was the happiest moment of my life.

97
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,960
That night he crawled on top of me,
stinking of wine,

98
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,920
and did what he did,
what little he could do,

99
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,170
and whispered in my ear, "Lyanna. "

100
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,590
Your sister was a corpse
and I was a living girl

101
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,720
and he loved her more than me.

102
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,270
When the king returns from his hunt,
I'll tell him the truth.

103
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:45,600
You must be gone by then -
you and your children.

104
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:48,400
I will not have
their blood on my hands.

105
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,940
Go as far away as you can,

106
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,280
with as many men as you can.

107
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,740
Because wherever you go,

108
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,120
Robert's wrath will follow you.

109
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,950
And what of my wrath, Lord Stark?

110
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,330
You should have taken the realm for yourself.

111
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,290
Jaime told me about the day
King's Landing fell.

112
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,210
He was sitting in the Iron Throne
and you made him give it up.

113
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,670
All you needed to do
was climb the steps yourself.

114
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,470
Such a sad mistake.

115
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:17,050
I've made many mistakes in my life...

116
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,720
but that wasn't one of them.

117
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,390
Oh, but it was.

118
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,730
When you play the game of thrones,
you win...

119
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,270
or you die.

120
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,270
There is no middle ground.

121
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:39,410
Come here.

122
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,720
Oh, yes! Oh, yes!

123
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:02,970
Oh!

124
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,980
Oh, yes! Oh! Oh!

125
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:11,110
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Oh!

126
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,820
Oh, yes! Oh, yes!

127
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,400
Oh!

128
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:19,360
No, no, no, no!

129
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,780
Is that what they teach you
up in the North?

130
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,580
And you -
wherever you're from -

131
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,630
do you have any idea
how ridiculous you sound?

132
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,050
Either of you understand
a thing that I'm saying?

133
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,880
Yes, my lord.

134
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:41,220
Let's start over, shall we?

135
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,810
You be the man...

136
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:46,890
and you be the woman.

137
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,770
Well, go ahead.

138
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,400
Slowly.

139
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:08,910
You're not fooling them.
They just paid you.

140
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,370
They know what you are.

141
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,630
They know it's all just an act.

142
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,500
Your job is to make them
forget what they know.

143
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,710
Now, that takes time.

144
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,550
You need to...

145
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,550
ease into it.

146
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,720
Go ahead.

147
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,430
Ease into it.

148
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,070
He's winning you over
in spite of yourself.

149
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,990
You're starting to like this.

150
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,990
He wants to believe you.

151
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,040
He's enjoyed his cock since he was old
enough to play with it. Why shouldn't you?

152
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,290
He knows he's better
than other men.

153
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,880
He's always known it deep down inside.
Now he has proof.

154
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,470
He's so good,

155
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:06,300
he's reaching something deep inside of you
that no one even knew was there,

156
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,060
overcoming your very nature.

157
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,350
Why don't you join us, my lord?

158
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:17,020
I'm saving myself for another.

159
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,610
What she doesn't know won't hurt her.

160
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,780
A stupid saying.

161
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,910
What we don't know is usually
what gets us killed.

162
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,370
She must be very beautiful.

163
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:32,200
No, not really.
Impeccable bloodlines though.

164
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,250
I do believe my lord's in love.

165
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:37,750
For many years.
Most of my life, really.

166
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,130
Play with her arse.

167
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,340
And she loved me too.

168
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,930
I was her little confidant, her plaything.

169
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:49,010
She could tell me anything,
anything at all.

170
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:52,980
She told me about all the horses
that she liked,

171
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,350
the castle that she wanted to live in

172
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,360
and the man that she wanted to marry -

173
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,730
a Northerner...
with a jaw like an anvil.

174
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,030
So I challenged him to a duel.

175
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,910
I mean, why not?
I'd read all the stories.

176
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:11,700
The little hero always beats
the big villain in all the stories.

177
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:16,290
In the end,
she wouldn't even let him kill me.

178
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,790
"He's just a boy," she said.

179
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,840
"Please don't hurt him. "

180
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,670
So he gave me a nice little scar
to remember him by, and off they went.

181
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,510
Is she still married to him?

182
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,550
Oh, no. He got himself killed
before the wedding...

183
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,440
...and she ended up with his brother,
an even more impressive specimen.

184
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,190
She loves him, I'm afraid.

185
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:42,820
And why wouldn't she?
I mean, who could compare to him?

186
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,190
He's just so...

187
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,660
...good.

188
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,660
Do you know what I learned,
losing that duel?

189
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:02,000
I learned that I'll never win, not that way.

190
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:04,000
That's their game,

191
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:06,670
their rules.

192
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,760
I'm not going to fight them.

193
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:12,050
I'm going to fuck them.
That's what I know.

194
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,310
That's what I am.

195
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:17,270
And only by admitting what we are
can we get what we want.

196
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,690
And what do you want?

197
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:23,400
Oh, everything, my dear.

198
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,320
Everything there is.

199
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:32,320
Now wash yourselves.
Both of you are working tonight.

200
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,370
Hmm.

201
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,860
You're a very lucky girl.
Do you know that?

202
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,660
Where I come from,
we don't show mercy to criminals.

203
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:16,450
Where I come from,
if someone like you attacked a little lord...

204
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:19,830
at low tide we'd lay you
on your back on the beach,

205
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,830
your hands and feet
chained to four stakes.

206
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,460
The sea would come in
closer and closer.

207
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:29,170
You'd see death creeping towards you
a few inches at a time.

208
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,300
Where is it you come from?

209
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,510
The Iron Islands.

210
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,680
They far away?

211
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,180
You've never heard of the Iron Islands?

212
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:42,940
Trust me, you've never heard
where I'm from neither.

213
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,400
"Trust me, my lord. "

214
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,530
You're not living in the wilderness anymore.

215
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,910
In civilized lands,
you refer to your betters

216
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:56,120
by their proper titles.

217
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,870
- And what's that?
- Lord.

218
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,580
Why?

219
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,630
What do you mean, why?

220
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,960
My father is Balon Greyjoy,
Lord of the Iron Islands.

221
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,670
What's that got to do with you?

222
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,630
If your father's lord,

223
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,640
how can you be lord too?

224
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:20,220
- I will be lord after my father.
- So you're not lord now?

225
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,180
No, you...

226
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,060
Are you having a go at me?
Is that it?

227
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:29,980
I just don't understand
how you southerners do things.

228
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:33,360
- I'm not a southerner.
- You're from south of the Wall.

229
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,530
That makes you a southerner to me.

230
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,500
You're an impudent little wench, aren't you?

231
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,370
Couldn't say, my lord.

232
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,420
Don't know what "impunent" means.

233
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,420
Impudent.

234
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,880
It means rude, disrespectful.

235
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:58,180
Do you want to lose that chain?

236
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,560
Theon Greyjoy!

237
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,060
The lady is our guest.

238
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,060
I thought she was our prisoner.

239
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:10,860
Are the two mutually exclusive
in your experience?

240
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,290
Chances are I won't be nearby
the next time that happens.

241
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,120
I'm used to worse than him.

242
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,290
Hmm?

243
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,090
I'm used to men who could
chew that boy up

244
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:32,670
and pick their teeth with his bones.

245
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,220
Why did you come here?

246
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,350
Didn't mean to come here.

247
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,310
Meant to get much further south than this.

248
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,310
As far south as south goes,

249
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,610
before the long night comes.

250
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,480
Why? What are you afraid of?

251
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:58,700
There's things that sleep in the day
and hunt at night.

252
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:03,330
- Owls and shadowcats...
- I'm not talking about owls and shadowcats.

253
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,960
The things you speak of -

254
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,590
they've been gone
for thousands of years.

255
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,550
They wasn't gone, old man.

256
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,380
They was sleeping.

257
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,050
And they ain't sleeping no more.

258
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:33,690
I miss girls.

259
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,490
Not even talking to them.
I never talked to them.

260
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:40,160
Just looking at them,

261
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,780
hearing them giggle.

262
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,460
Don't you miss girls?

263
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:55,710
Riders.

264
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:59,220
The horn.
We have to blow the horn.

265
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,510
Why is he alone?

266
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:06,890
One blast for a ranger returning,

267
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,770
two for wildlings,

268
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:11,020
- three for...
- There's no rider.

269
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:45,300
Whoa, boy, whoa.

270
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:47,430
That's my Uncle Benjen's horse.

271
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,570
Where's my uncle?

272
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,320
Ned!

273
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,120
It's Robert.
We were hunting...

274
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,990
a boar...

275
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:19,340
I should have
spent more time with you,

276
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,170
shown you how to be a man.

277
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,970
I was never meant to be a father.

278
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,410
Go on.

279
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,580
You don't want to see this.

280
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,800
My fault.

281
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:12,270
Too much wine,
missed my thrust.

282
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,780
It stinks.

283
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:27,070
It stinks like death.

284
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,990
Don't think I can't smell it.

285
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,460
I paid the bastard back, Ned.

286
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,880
I drove my knife
right through his brain.

287
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,420
You ask 'em if I didn't. Ask 'em!

288
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:47,470
I want the funeral feast to be
the biggest the Kingdoms ever saw.

289
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:52,140
And I want everyone
to taste the boar that got me.

290
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:59,100
Now leave us, the lot of you.
I need to talk to Ned.

291
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:02,400
- Robert, my sweet...
- Out, all of you!

292
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:25,090
You damned fool.

293
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,340
Paper and ink on the table.

294
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:29,720
Write down what I say.

295
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:41,350
"In the name of Robert
of the House Baratheon,

296
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,610
"first of... "

297
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,270
You know how it goes.

298
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,940
Fill in the damn titles.

299
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:49,110
"I hereby command

300
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,990
"Eddard of House Stark... "

301
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,580
titles, titles...

302
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:58,120
"to serve as Lord Regent
and Protector of the Realm

303
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,370
"upon my death,

304
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,420
"to rule in my stead

305
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:06,050
"until my son Joffrey comes of age. "

306
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,070
Give it over.

307
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,790
Give it to the council...

308
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,500
after I'm dead.

309
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,960
At least they'll say I did this right,

310
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:51,470
this one thing.

311
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,340
You'll rule now.

312
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,180
You'll hate it worse than I did...

313
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,310
but you'll do it well.

314
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,190
The girl...

315
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,900
Daenerys.

316
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,900
You were right.
Varys, Littlefinger,

317
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:15,910
my brother... worthless.

318
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:18,240
No one to tell me "no" but you.

319
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:22,830
Only you.

320
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,920
Let her live.

321
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:31,210
Stop it, if it's not too late.

322
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,050
I will.

323
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,470
And my son...

324
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,970
help him, Ned.

325
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:41,390
Make him better than me.

326
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:44,520
I'll...

327
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:48,230
I'll do everything I can
to honor your memory.

328
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,690
My memory.

329
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,530
King Robert Baratheon,

330
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,830
murdered by a pig.

331
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:06,040
Give me something for the pain
and let me die.

332
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,890
Give him milk of the poppy.

333
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:32,940
He was reeling from the wine.

334
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,740
He commanded us to...

335
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,160
step aside, but...

336
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,370
I failed him.

337
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,370
No man could have
protected him from himself.

338
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,250
I wonder, Ser Barristan,

339
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:53,170
who gave the king this wine?

340
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:57,300
His squire,
from the king's own skin.

341
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:00,050
His squire? The Lannister boy?

342
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:03,310
Such a dutiful boy
to make sure His Grace

343
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,810
did not lack refreshment.

344
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:09,400
I do hope the poor lad
does not blame himself.

345
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,160
His Grace has had a change of heart
concerning Daenerys Targaryen.

346
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:25,950
Whatever arrangements you made...

347
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,500
unmake them. At once.

348
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,920
I'm afraid those birds have flown.

349
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,130
The girl is likely dead already.

350
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:50,480
The stallion who mounts
the world has no need for iron chairs.

351
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,190
According to the prophecy...

352
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,690
...the stallion will ride
to the ends of the earth.

353
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:57,400
The earth ends at the black salt sea.

354
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:59,450
No horse can cross the poison water.

355
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:01,660
The earth does not end at the sea...

356
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:04,120
...there are many dirts beyond the sea.

357
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,540
The dirt where I was born.

358
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:12,170
Not dirts. Lands.

359
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:14,590
Lands, yes...

360
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,510
There are thousands of ships
in the free cities.

361
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:20,550
Wooden horses that fly across the sea...

362
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:24,390
Let's speak no more of wooden horses
and iron chairs.

363
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,180
It's not a chair. It's a...

364
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,560
...throne.

365
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:35,150
Throne.

366
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:39,530
A chair for a King to sit upon,

367
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:41,240
or...

368
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,030
...a Queen.

369
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:53,920
A King does not need a chair to sit upon.

370
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,840
He only needs a horse.

371
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,150
Can't you help me
make him understand?

372
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,900
The Dothraki do things in their own time,
for their own reasons.

373
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:25,570
Have patience, Khaleesi.
We will go home, I promise you.

374
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,780
My brother was a fool, I know,

375
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:30,450
but he was the rightful heir
to the Seven Kingdoms.

376
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,960
Have I said something funny, ser?

377
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,000
Forgive me, Khaleesi,
but your ancestor Aegon the Conqueror

378
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:39,630
didn't seize six of the Kingdoms
because they were his right.

379
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,590
He had no right to them.
He seized them because he could.

380
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,130
And because he had dragons.

381
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:47,010
Ah, well, having a few dragons
makes things easier.

382
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:51,970
- You don't believe it.
- Have you ever seen a dragon, Khaleesi?

383
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,890
I believe what my eyes
and ears report.

384
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:57,610
As for the rest...
it was 300 years ago.

385
00:28:57,730 --> 00:28:59,440
Who knows what really happened?

386
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:01,860
Now if you'll pardon me,
I'll seek out the merchant captain,

387
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,650
see if he has any letters for me.

388
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:06,490
- I'll come with you.
- No, no, don't trouble yourself.

389
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:09,490
Enjoy the market.
I'll rejoin you soon enough.

390
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:20,340
Psst! Jorah the Andal.

391
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:24,670
The Spider sends his greetings

392
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,880
and his congratulations.

393
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:31,850
A royal pardon.
You can go home now.

394
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,950
Sweet reds...

395
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:54,700
I have sweet reds from Lys,
Volantis and the Arbor!

396
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:57,540
Tyroshi pear brandy! Andalish sours!

397
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,000
I have them! I have them!

398
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,630
A taste for the Khaleesi?

399
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,630
I have a sweet red from Dorne, my lady.

400
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,510
One taste and you'll
name your first child after me.

401
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:15,730
My son already has
his name, but I'll try your summerwine.

402
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:17,020
Just a taste.

403
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:20,190
My lady, you are from Westeros.

404
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:23,230
You have the honor of addressing Daenerys
of the House Targaryen,

405
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:28,490
Khaleesi of the Riding Men
and Princess of the Seven Kingdoms.

406
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:30,570
- Princess.
- Rise.

407
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,700
I'd still like to taste that wine.

408
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:36,040
That? Dornish swill.

409
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,540
Not worthy of a princess.

410
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,920
I have a dry red from the Arbor -

411
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,960
nectar of the gods.

412
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:45,760
Let me give you a cask.
A... A gift.

413
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,340
You honor me, ser.

414
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,840
The honor...
the honor is all mine.

415
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:51,760
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.

416
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:58,640
You know, there are many in your homeland
that pray for your return, Princess.

417
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:00,390
I hope to repay
your kindness someday.

418
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,900
Rakharo.

419
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:04,020
Put down that cask.

420
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,360
- Is something wrong?
- I have a thirst.

421
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:10,320
Open it.

422
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:13,030
The wine is for the khaleesi.
It's not for the likes of you.

423
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,370
Open it.

424
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,590
Pour.

425
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,720
It would be a crime
to drink a wine this rich

426
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,840
- without at least giving it time to breathe.
- Do as he says.

427
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:35,470
As the princess commands.

428
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:50,030
Sweet, isn't it?

429
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:52,280
Can you smell the fruit, ser?

430
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,410
Taste it, my lord.

431
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:59,370
Tell me that that is not the finest wine
that has ever touched your tongue.

432
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,130
You first.

433
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:08,210
Me?

434
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,760
I'm afraid I am not worthy of the vintage.

435
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,300
Besides, it is a poor wine merchant
who would drink up his own wares.

436
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:16,180
You will drink.

437
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:34,660
Stop him!

438
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,840
Come.

439
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:59,930
You came to us as outlaws...

440
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:03,230
...poachers, rapers,

441
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:05,390
killers, thieves.

442
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:09,150
You came alone, in chains,

443
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:10,900
without friends

444
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,190
or honor.

445
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,700
You came to us rich
and you came to us poor.

446
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:19,240
Some of you bear the names

447
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:21,240
of proud Houses,

448
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
others only bastard names
or no names at all.

449
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,870
It does not matter.

450
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
All that is in the past.

451
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:32,050
Here...

452
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:35,170
on the Wall...

453
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,640
we are all one House.

454
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:42,060
- Tonight...
- You're allowed to look happy.

455
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:45,940
You're going to be a ranger.

456
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:48,190
Isn't that what you always wanted?

457
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:50,690
I want to find my uncle.

458
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:55,030
I know he's alive out there.
I know he is.

459
00:33:56,410 --> 00:34:00,070
I wish I could help you,
but I'm no ranger.

460
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,160
It's the steward's life for me.

461
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:05,330
There's honor in being a steward.

462
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,790
Not much, really.

463
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,420
But there's food.

464
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,260
Here... you begin anew.

465
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:27,270
A man of the Night's Watch...

466
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:31,770
lives his life for the realm.

467
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,190
Not for a king...

468
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,110
or a lord, or the honor of this House

469
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,610
or that House,

470
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:43,490
not for gold or glory,

471
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,910
or a woman's love,

472
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,000
but for the realm

473
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,790
and all the people in it.

474
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:54,380
You've all learned
the words of the vow.

475
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:57,470
Think carefully before you say them.

476
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:00,380
The penalty for desertion...

477
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,850
is death.

478
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,690
You can take your vows here...

479
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:12,480
tonight...

480
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:13,900
at sunset.

481
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:17,230
Do any of you still keep the old gods?

482
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:21,360
I do, my lord.

483
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:24,870
You'll want to take your vow
before a heart tree as your uncle did.

484
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:26,040
Yes, my lord.

485
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,040
You'll find a weirwood
a mile north of the Wall.

486
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,960
And your old gods too, maybe.

487
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:36,050
My lord, might I go as well?

488
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:38,050
Does House Tarly keep the old gods?

489
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:40,420
No, my lord.

490
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,090
I was named in the light of the Seven,

491
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,720
as my father was
and his father before him.

492
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:49,730
Why would you forsake the gods
of your father and your House?

493
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,980
The Night's Watch is my House now.

494
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,610
The Seven have never answered my prayers.

495
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,030
Perhaps the old gods will.

496
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,860
As you wish, lad.

497
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:06,830
You've all been assigned an order,

498
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:09,750
according to our needs

499
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,540
and your strengths.

500
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:14,540
Halder to the builders.

501
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,250
Pyp to the stewards.

502
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:20,210
Toad to the builders.
Grenn to the rangers.

503
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,260
Samwell to the stewards.

504
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:25,930
Matthar to the rangers.
Dareon to the stewards.

505
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,970
Balian to the rangers.

506
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,680
Rast to the rangers.

507
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:31,350
Jon to the stewards.

508
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,190
Rancer to the builder.

509
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:36,190
Echiel to the builders.
Gordo to the stewards.

510
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:39,650
Niko to the rangers.
Escan to the rangers.

511
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,780
Vorkoy to the builders.
Joby to the stables.

512
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:46,120
Mink to the kitchens.
Allo to the builders.

513
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,530
Nelugo to the rangers.

514
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:52,160
May all the gods preserve you.

515
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,460
Rangers with me.

516
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,050
Builders!

517
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:25,650
Samwell, you will assist me
in the rookery and library.

518
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:29,700
Pyp, you will report
to Bowen Marsh in the kitchens.

519
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:34,500
Luke, report to One-Eyed Joe
in the stables.

520
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:38,500
Dareon, we are sending you
to Eastwatch.

521
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:41,340
Present yourself to Borcas
when you arrive.

522
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:44,630
Make no comment about his nose.

523
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,930
Jon Snow,
Lord Commander Mormont

524
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:51,970
has requested you
for his personal steward.

525
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,730
Will I serve the Lord Commander's meals
and fetch hot water for his bath?

526
00:37:56,850 --> 00:38:00,560
Certainly. And keep a fire burning
in his chambers,

527
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:03,530
change his sheets
and blankets daily

528
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:07,240
and do everything else
the Lord Commander requires of you.

529
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:11,870
Do you take me for a servant?

530
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:14,500
We took you for a man
of the Night's Watch.

531
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:17,410
But perhaps we were wrong in that.

532
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:21,130
- May I go?
- As you wish.

533
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:30,890
Jon, wait! Don't you see
what they're doing?

534
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:32,890
I see Ser Alliser's revenge, that's all.

535
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:34,810
He wanted it and he got it.

536
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:37,310
Stewards are nothing but maids!

537
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,480
I'm a better swordsman
and rider than any of you!

538
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,610
- It's not fair.
- Fair?

539
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,690
I was singing for a high lord
at Acorn Hall

540
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:48,740
when he put his hand on my leg
and he wanted to see my cock.

541
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:52,620
I pushed him away and he said he'd have
my hands cut off for stealing their silver.

542
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,540
So now I'm here -
at the end of the world

543
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:57,410
with no one to sing for
but old men and little shits like you.

544
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,420
I'll never see my family again.

545
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,630
I'll never be inside a woman again.

546
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:02,960
So don't tell me about fair.

547
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:06,840
I thought you were caught stealing
a wheel of cheese for your starving sister.

548
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:11,050
Think I was gonna tell a bunch of strangers
that a high lord tried to grab my cock?

549
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:17,180
Could you sing me a song, Pyp?
I'd like to hear a song.

550
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:23,980
Now listen to me.

551
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:27,360
The old man is the Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

552
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,280
You'll be with him day and night.

553
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,820
Yes, you'll clean his clothes.

554
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:35,780
But you'll also take his letters,
attend him at meetings,

555
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,750
squire for him in battle.

556
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:41,500
You'll know everything,
be part of everything.

557
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,210
And he asked for you himself.

558
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:47,050
He wants to groom you for command.

559
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,760
I just...

560
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,810
I always wanted to be a ranger.

561
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:01,100
I always wanted to be a wizard.

562
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,480
What?

563
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,780
No, I'm serious.

564
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,490
So you'll stay
and say your words with me?

565
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:20,330
Lord Stark... a moment.

566
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:23,540
Alone, if you will.

567
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,140
He named you Protector of the Realm.

568
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:38,430
He did.

569
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,140
She won't care.

570
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:43,690
Give me an hour and I can put
a hundred swords at your command.

571
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:45,600
And what should I do
with a hundred swords?

572
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:49,570
Strike! Tonight, while the castle sleeps.

573
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:53,070
We must get Joffrey away from his mother
and into our custody.

574
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,990
Protector of the Realm or no,
he who holds the king holds the kingdom.

575
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:01,160
Every moment you delay gives Cersei
another moment to prepare.

576
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:04,160
By the time Robert dies,
it will be too late for the both of us.

577
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:06,040
What about Stannis?

578
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:09,380
Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei
and delivering them to Stannis?

579
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:12,210
You have odd notions
about protecting the realm.

580
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,920
Stannis is your older brother.

581
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:16,180
This isn't about the bloody
line of succession.

582
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:20,390
That didn't matter when you rebelled
against the Mad King. It shouldn't matter now.

583
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:24,480
What's best for the Kingdoms?

584
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,480
What's best for the people we rule?

585
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:31,150
We all know what Stannis is.

586
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,570
He inspires no love or loyalty.

587
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,320
He's not a king.

588
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,030
I am.

589
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:47,710
Stannis is a commander.

590
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:50,880
He's led men into war twice.

591
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,750
He destroyed the Greyjoy fleet.

592
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,630
Yes, he's a good soldier.
Everyone knows that. So was Robert.

593
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:58,050
Tell me something.

594
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:00,550
Do you still believe good soldiers
make good kings?

595
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:11,020
I will not dishonor Robert's last hours
by shedding blood in his halls...

596
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:13,570
and dragging frightened children
from their beds.

597
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:29,920
You will sail to Dragonstone tonight.

598
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,630
You will place this in the hand
of Stannis Baratheon.

599
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:36,090
Not his steward...

600
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:39,510
not his captain of the guard...

601
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,930
and not his wife.

602
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,600
Only Stannis himself.

603
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:51,610
Yes, my lord.

604
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:55,320
Now leave us.

605
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:07,120
My Lord Protector.

606
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:14,750
The king has no trueborn sons.

607
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,340
Joffrey and Tommen...

608
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:19,340
are Jaime Lannister's bastards.

609
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:24,850
- So when the king dies...
- The throne passes to his brother...

610
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:27,810
Lord Stannis.

611
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:30,060
So it would seem.

612
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:34,190
- Unless...
- There is no "unless".

613
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,650
He is the rightful heir.
Nothing can change that.

614
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,820
And he cannot take the throne
without your help.

615
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:42,950
You would be wise to deny it to him
and to make sure Joffrey succeeds.

616
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:48,660
Do you have a shred of honor?

617
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:52,540
You are now Hand of the King
and Protector of the Realm.

618
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:54,880
All of the power is yours.
You need only...

619
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,500
reach out and take it.

620
00:43:57,630 --> 00:43:59,670
Make peace with the Lannisters.

621
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:03,220
Release the Imp.
Wed your daughter to Joffrey.

622
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:06,050
We've plenty of time to get rid of Stannis,

623
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:09,600
and if Joffrey seems likely to cause problems
when he comes into his throne,

624
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,980
we simply reveal his little secret

625
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:15,190
- and seat Lord Renly there instead.
- We?

626
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:19,110
You'll need someone to share these burdens,
I assure you.

627
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,240
My price would be modest.

628
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,410
What you suggest is treason.

629
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:26,620
Only if we lose.

630
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:31,960
Make peace with the Lannisters,
you say...

631
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,580
with the people who tried to murder my boy.

632
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:39,130
We only make peace
with our enemies, my lord.

633
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:41,420
That's why it's called "making peace".

634
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:44,800
No. I won't do it.

635
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,390
So it will be Stannis and war?

636
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:49,720
There is no other choice.

637
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,230
He is the heir.

638
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:54,810
So why did you call me here?

639
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:56,980
Not for my wisdom, clearly.

640
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:00,690
You promised Catelyn
you would help me.

641
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:03,610
The queen has a dozen knights
and a hundred men-at-arms -

642
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:07,530
enough to overwhelm what remains
of my household guard.

643
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:09,450
I need the gold cloaks.

644
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:12,790
The City Watch is 2,000 strong...

645
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:16,040
and sworn to defend the king's peace.

646
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,460
Look at you.

647
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:23,630
You know what you want me to do,

648
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,800
you know it has to be done,

649
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:28,010
but it's not honorable, so...

650
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,470
the words stick in your throat.

651
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:33,600
When the queen proclaims one king

652
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:35,440
and the Hand proclaims another,

653
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:38,270
whose peace do the gold cloaks protect?

654
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:41,860
Who do they follow?

655
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:48,740
The man who pays them.

656
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:38,540
Hear my words
and bear witness to my vow.

657
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:42,040
Night gathers
and now my watch begins.

658
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:45,380
It shall not end until my death.

659
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:47,720
I shall take no wife,

660
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:50,800
hold no lands,
father no children.

661
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:55,020
I shall wear no crowns
and win no glory.

662
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:58,770
I shall live and die at my post.

663
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,770
I am the sword in the darkness.

664
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:04,570
I am the watcher on the walls.

665
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:08,610
I am the shield that guards
the realms of men.

666
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:12,570
I pledge my life and honor
to the Night's Watch,

667
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:16,540
for this night
and all the nights to come.

668
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:18,750
You knelt as boys.

669
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:21,370
Rise now as men of the Night's Watch.

670
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,520
Well done. Well done.

671
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,230
What's he got there?

672
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:48,360
To me, Ghost.
Bring it here.

673
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:52,860
Gods be good!

674
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,500
What will they do to him?

675
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:06,920
When the khalasar rides,
he'll be leashed to a saddle

676
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:10,630
and forced to run behind the horses
for as long as he can.

677
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,590
And when he falls?

678
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:16,760
I saw a man last nine miles once.

679
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:20,640
King Robert still wants me dead.

680
00:48:20,770 --> 00:48:22,980
This poisoner was the first.
He won't be the last.

681
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:26,940
I thought he'd leave me alone
now that my brother is gone.

682
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:29,730
He will never leave you alone.

683
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:33,110
If you ride to darkest Asshai,
his assassins will follow you.

684
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,700
If you sailed all the way
to the Basilisk Isles,

685
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:37,030
his spies would tell him.

686
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:40,160
He will never abandon the hunt.

687
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:44,170
You're a Targaryen -
the last Targaryen.

688
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:46,330
Your son will have Targaryen blood

689
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:49,000
with 40,000 riders behind him.

690
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:52,380
He will not have my son.

691
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:55,340
He will not have you either, Khaleesi.

692
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,210
Moon of my life.

693
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,300
Are you hurt?

694
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:44,730
Jorah the Andal,

695
00:49:44,850 --> 00:49:47,600
I heard what you did.

696
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:51,270
Choose any horse you wish, it is yours.

697
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:59,450
I make this gift to you.

698
00:50:04,830 --> 00:50:09,670
And to my son,
the stallion who will mount the world,

699
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:13,250
I will also pledge a gift.

700
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:17,550
I will give him the iron chair...

701
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:21,680
...that his mother's father sat upon.

702
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,520
I will give him Seven Kingdoms.

703
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:31,650
I, Drogo, will do this.

704
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:35,530
I will take my Khalasar west
to where the world ends...

705
00:50:35,650 --> 00:50:41,120
...and ride wooden horses
across the black salt water...

706
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:44,740
...as no Khal has done before.

707
00:50:46,830 --> 00:50:51,460
I will kill the men in iron suits...

708
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:54,590
...and tear down their stone houses.

709
00:50:57,010 --> 00:51:00,760
I will rape their women...

710
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:03,390
...take their children as slaves...

711
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:06,640
...and bring their broken gods
back to Vaes Dothrak.

712
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,610
This, I vow...

713
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:15,650
...I, Drogo, son of Bharbo.

714
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:22,030
I swear before the Mother of Mountains...

715
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,990
...as the stars look down in witness.

716
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:28,620
As the stars look down in witness.

717
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:59,740
Lord Stark!

718
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:01,740
- Stop!
- No, all right.

719
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,660
It's all right.
Let him through.

720
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:07,410
Lord Stark, King Joffrey and the Queen Regent
request your presence in the Throne Room.

721
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:09,330
King Joffrey?

722
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:10,910
King Robert is gone.

723
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,210
The gods give him rest.

724
00:52:24,970 --> 00:52:27,260
All is accomplished.
The City Watch is yours.

725
00:52:27,390 --> 00:52:29,060
Good.

726
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:31,810
Is Lord Renly joining us?

727
00:52:33,270 --> 00:52:36,360
I fear Lord Renly has left the city.

728
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:40,400
He rode through the Old Gate
an hour before dawn

729
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:44,410
with Ser Loras Tyrell
and some 50 retainers.

730
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:48,030
Last seen galloping south
in some haste.

731
00:53:08,850 --> 00:53:10,890
We stand behind you, Lord Stark.

732
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,070
All hail His Grace,

733
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:25,030
Joffrey of Houses Baratheon
and Lannister,

734
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,780
the First of His Name,

735
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:29,120
King of the Andals and the First Men,

736
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,540
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms

737
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:34,710
and Protector of the Realm.

738
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:56,560
I command the council to make all necessary
arrangements for my coronation.

739
00:53:56,690 --> 00:53:59,230
I wish to be crowned within the fortnight.

740
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:02,150
Today I shall accept oaths of fealty

741
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,150
from my loyal councilors.

742
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:09,450
Ser Barristan...

743
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:13,040
I believe no man here
could ever question your honor.

744
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:27,800
King Robert's seal - unbroken.

745
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:38,770
"Lord Eddard Stark is herein named...

746
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,690
"Protector of the Realm...

747
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:43,730
"to rule as regent...

748
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:46,440
"until the heir come of age. "

749
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:49,860
May I see that letter, Ser Barristan?

750
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:00,000
Protector of the Realm.

751
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:07,130
Is this meant to be your shield, Lord Stark?

752
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,840
A piece of paper?

753
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:16,020
- Those were the king's words.
- We have a new king now.

754
00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:21,980
Lord Eddard, when we last spoke
you offered me some counsel.

755
00:55:23,110 --> 00:55:25,360
Allow me to return the courtesy.

756
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:27,650
Bend the knee, my lord.

757
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:30,700
Bend the knee
and swear loyalty to my son...

758
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:33,990
and we shall allow you
to live out your days

759
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:36,790
in the gray waste you call home.

760
00:55:36,910 --> 00:55:39,080
Your son has no claim to the throne.

761
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:40,420
Liar!

762
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:43,420
You condemn yourself
with your own mouth, Lord Stark.

763
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:45,380
Ser Barristan, seize this traitor.

764
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:50,130
Ser Barristan is a good man,
a loyal man. Do him no harm.

765
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,140
You think he stands alone?

766
00:55:57,470 --> 00:56:00,520
Kill him! Kill all of them!
I command it!

767
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:04,690
Commander!
Take the queen and her children into custody.

768
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:08,940
Escort them back to the royal apartments
and keep them there, under guard.

769
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:10,860
Men of the Watch!

770
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:17,370
I want no bloodshed.

771
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:20,000
Tell your men to lay down their swords.

772
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:22,080
No one needs to die.

773
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,920
Now!

774
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:39,100
I did warn you not to trust me.
