Hey.

00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:28,795
Hey, what are you doing here?

163
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:32,924
I heard you picked up some big new case
on the news. How come you didn't call me?

164
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,468
I was going to, but it all happened so fast.

165
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:40,515
Plus, I thought you and dad would try and
talk me out of going back to work so soon.

166
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,395
-Which is why you're here.
-I'm worried about you.

167

I'm still going to two meetings a day and...

what kind of guy Bertinelli is.

170

on her way back to Starling City to kill him.

And I love you for caring.

175
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:16,134
But, Sara,
you've never seen me be a lawyer before.

176
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:18,344

SLADE [OVER WALKIE-TALKIE]:
<i>Sara. Are you there?</i>

00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:59,344
Slade. Is Oliver...?

<i>He's in pain. Yes.</i>

191
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,556
But he's still breathing.

192
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:04,807
For now.

Slade, listen, you won, okay?
You have the <i>Amazo</i>.

Just let Oliver go,
and then you can leave us here.

Why not?

198
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:21,824
During our assault,
the ship's engine was damaged. She won't sail.

199
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:26,996
During the attack, unfortunately,
I decapitated the engineer.

200
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:30,041
<i>So, what can we do about our problem, Sara?</i>

201
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,750
You want Oliver back.

202
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,753
And I need someone qualified
to fix this boat.

203
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,547

Like Helena, he is not too pleased
with my skills as a mentor.

Laurel won't drop the case.
She's headed to court right now.

OLIVER: The courthouse.

Well, hey, you forgot your baby arrows.

212
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:14,210
I get your whole no-killing spree, but if it
comes to saving Laurel or killing Helena...

213
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:16,129
Those aren't the only two choices.

You were happy to let Dig take the kill shot
when it was Slade threatening your family.

This is different.

00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,223
I created the Huntress.

218
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,058
Yeah, well, you created Slade too.

219
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,400
You're right.

220
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,610
You're right.

221
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,863
But when it comes to our families...

222
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,073
...neither one of us thinks clearly.

223
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:46,825
Which is why you have to stay here.

Ollie, I can't.

225

What do you guys think?

Oh, I think if the Huntress shows up,
you should totally kick her ass.

229

Don't tell me you're worried about me too.

No. I just wanted to watch the trial.
I heard the prosecutor was something special.
