1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
and I am the fastest man alive.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist,

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
In an attempt to stop the
evil speedster Savitar,

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I was accidentally
thrust into the future,

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
and I saw him murder
the woman that I love.

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
But I won't let that happen.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I'm gonna do everything in my power

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
to change the future,

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
and I'm the only one fast
enough to keep her alive.

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I am The Flash.

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,472
&nbsp

27
00:00:00,482 --> 00:00:02,388
Previously on "The Flash."

28
00:00:02,398 --> 00:00:02,390
&nbsp

29
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,223
I'm free!

30
00:00:04,233 --> 00:00:04,225
&nbsp

31
00:00:04,235 --> 00:00:07,339
- Who are you?
- I am the future Flash.

32
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:07,364
&nbsp

33
00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:09,228
I can't spend the rest of my life

34
00:00:09,238 --> 00:00:09,230
&nbsp

35
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,133
wondering if I'm gonna
become Killer Frost.

36
00:00:11,143 --> 00:00:11,158
&nbsp

37
00:00:11,168 --> 00:00:13,227
I understand the real reason
that you invited me on this team.

38
00:00:13,237 --> 00:00:13,252
&nbsp

39
00:00:13,262 --> 00:00:14,915
You just want your own
meta-human specialist

40
00:00:14,925 --> 00:00:14,954
&nbsp

41
00:00:14,964 --> 00:00:16,421
to try and find you a cure.

42
00:00:16,431 --> 00:00:16,423
&nbsp

43
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,485
- That's not the only reason.
- I wish I could believe that.

44
00:00:18,495 --> 00:00:18,510
&nbsp

45
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,542
I'm Cisco, by the
way. You must be Gypsy.

46
00:00:20,552 --> 00:00:20,543
&nbsp

47
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:23,461
- You're into me.
- Even if I was, you couldn't handle me.

48
00:00:23,471 --> 00:00:23,463
&nbsp

49
00:00:23,473 --> 00:00:24,512
I'll marry that woman.

50
00:00:24,522 --> 00:00:24,514
&nbsp

51
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,047
Iris West, will you marry me?

52
00:00:26,057 --> 00:00:26,049
&nbsp

53
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:27,215
Yes.

54
00:00:27,225 --> 00:00:30,387
&nbsp

55
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:32,887
Looks like we may
need to find a new job.

56
00:00:32,897 --> 00:00:32,889
&nbsp

57
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:35,606
Heard Stagg Industries
may be getting bought out.

58
00:00:35,616 --> 00:00:35,608
&nbsp

59
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:36,974
By who?

60
00:00:36,984 --> 00:00:36,976
&nbsp

61
00:00:36,986 --> 00:00:38,726
Doesn't really matter now, does it?

62
00:00:38,736 --> 00:00:38,728
&nbsp

63
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:42,063
All I know is we got
millions of dollars of tech...

64
00:00:42,073 --> 00:00:42,065
&nbsp

65
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:44,218
like whatever that thing is...

66
00:00:44,228 --> 00:00:44,243
&nbsp

67
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:45,650
that no one's using.

68
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:45,652
&nbsp

69
00:00:45,662 --> 00:00:47,819
Then surely you gentlemen won't mind

70
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:47,821
&nbsp

71
00:00:47,831 --> 00:00:50,665
if I abscond with some of it.

72
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:51,875
&nbsp

73
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,625
This piece in particular.

74
00:00:54,635 --> 00:00:54,627
&nbsp

75
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:56,544
How did you get in here?

76
00:00:56,554 --> 00:00:56,546
&nbsp

77
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:59,547
Believe me, that's the least
impressive of my tricks.

78
00:00:59,557 --> 00:00:59,572
&nbsp

79
00:00:59,582 --> 00:01:01,028
Hands up, pal

80
00:01:01,038 --> 00:01:01,053
&nbsp

81
00:01:01,063 --> 00:01:02,394
Do it now, or I'll shoot.

82
00:01:02,404 --> 00:01:02,419
&nbsp

83
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:03,835
Stop!

84
00:01:03,845 --> 00:01:08,675
&nbsp

85
00:01:08,685 --> 00:01:10,508
How the hell did he do that?

86
00:01:10,518 --> 00:01:15,231
&nbsp

87
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,732
Maybe you can figure out how I did it,

88
00:01:17,742 --> 00:01:17,734
&nbsp

89
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:21,225
but... I doubt you'll have time.

90
00:01:21,235 --> 00:01:33,638

92
00:01:36,444 --> 00:01:39,205
&nbsp

93
00:01:39,215 --> 00:01:41,456
It's just beautiful.

94
00:01:41,466 --> 00:01:41,458
&nbsp

95
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:43,554
You know what, it matches
the sparkle in your eyes.

96
00:01:43,564 --> 00:01:43,556
&nbsp

97
00:01:43,566 --> 00:01:44,711
Aw, thank you.

98
00:01:44,721 --> 00:01:44,736
&nbsp

99
00:01:44,746 --> 00:01:47,712
Barry, your grandfather had
really good taste in jewelry.

100
00:01:47,722 --> 00:01:47,714
&nbsp

101
00:01:47,724 --> 00:01:49,130
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, he did.

102
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:49,132
&nbsp

103
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:52,226
Okay, so, break it
down. How did it happen?

104
00:01:52,236 --> 00:01:53,136
&nbsp

105
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:56,270
Um... we were at the apartment,

106
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:56,295
&nbsp

107
00:01:56,305 --> 00:01:58,169
and, um,

108
00:01:58,179 --> 00:01:58,194
&nbsp

109
00:01:58,204 --> 00:01:59,958
Barry sang to me.

110
00:01:59,968 --> 00:01:59,983
&nbsp

111
00:01:59,993 --> 00:02:02,310
And then he proposed.

112
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:02,312
&nbsp

113
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,278
Oh, my God, that's so romantic.

114
00:02:04,288 --> 00:02:04,280
&nbsp

115
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,198
- You sing?
- Not as good as Joe.

116
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:07,200
&nbsp

117
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,900
Shut up, Barry.

118
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:08,902
&nbsp

119
00:02:08,912 --> 00:02:11,402
Well, okay, that reminds me,

120
00:02:11,412 --> 00:02:11,404
&nbsp

121
00:02:11,414 --> 00:02:13,371
my sister has four tickets
that she can't use...

122
00:02:13,381 --> 00:02:13,373
&nbsp

123
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,956
- ... to "Hamilton."
- "Hamilton"?

124
00:02:14,966 --> 00:02:14,958
&nbsp

125
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,657
On the house. I thought that maybe

126
00:02:16,667 --> 00:02:16,659
&nbsp

127
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:18,075
we could make it a double
if you guys were interested?

128
00:02:18,085 --> 00:02:18,077
&nbsp

129
00:02:18,087 --> 00:02:20,411
Uh, yeah, we're interested. When?

130
00:02:20,421 --> 00:02:20,413
&nbsp

131
00:02:20,423 --> 00:02:21,829
First weekend in July.

132
00:02:21,839 --> 00:02:24,703
&nbsp

133
00:02:24,713 --> 00:02:26,250
Um, July.

134
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:26,252
&nbsp

135
00:02:26,262 --> 00:02:28,970
Y... does that not work for you guys?

136
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:28,972
&nbsp

137
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,254
Um...

138
00:02:30,264 --> 00:02:30,256
&nbsp

139
00:02:30,266 --> 00:02:31,839
No, that works great.

140
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:31,841
&nbsp

141
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:34,759
We'll be there, all of us.

142
00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:37,430
&nbsp

143
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,064
Don't! Don't do this!

144
00:02:40,074 --> 00:02:40,066
&nbsp

145
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:42,335
Please? I'm begging you! Just...

146
00:02:42,345 --> 00:02:42,360
&nbsp

147
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,401
Barry!

148
00:02:43,411 --> 00:02:43,403
&nbsp

149
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,572
You lose, Barry.

150
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:46,105
&nbsp

151
00:02:46,115 --> 00:02:47,605
No!

152
00:02:47,615 --> 00:02:57,917
&nbsp

153
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,618
Well, everything's the same.

154
00:03:00,628 --> 00:03:00,620
&nbsp

155
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,670
The future has not changed.

156
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:02,672
&nbsp

157
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,922
All right. Well, we have two months

158
00:03:04,932 --> 00:03:04,924
&nbsp

159
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:06,174
to make sure that it does.

160
00:03:06,184 --> 00:03:06,176
&nbsp

161
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,592
Okay, well, we should approach this

162
00:03:07,602 --> 00:03:07,594
&nbsp

163
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,126
the same way we approach
any other problem...

164
00:03:09,136 --> 00:03:09,128
&nbsp

165
00:03:09,138 --> 00:03:10,678
start with what we know.

166
00:03:10,688 --> 00:03:10,680
&nbsp

167
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,797
Problem can't be solved
if it's not understood.

168
00:03:12,807 --> 00:03:12,799
&nbsp

169
00:03:12,809 --> 00:03:14,966
Therein lies the rub. I
feel like we can't understand

170
00:03:14,976 --> 00:03:14,968
&nbsp

171
00:03:14,978 --> 00:03:16,467
any of this until it actually happens.

172
00:03:16,477 --> 00:03:16,469
&nbsp

173
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:17,935
It's like Savitar's prophecies.

174
00:03:17,945 --> 00:03:17,937
&nbsp

175
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:20,221
Precisely, and just like
the newspaper headlines.

176
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:20,223
&nbsp

177
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:22,139
- Well, all bar one.
- _

178
00:03:22,149 --> 00:03:23,810
&nbsp

179
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,860
It's a crime scene. We gotta go.

180
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:25,862
&nbsp

181
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,445
- Stagg Industries?
- All right, no.

182
00:03:27,455 --> 00:03:27,447
&nbsp

183
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,981
Hey, Julian, before you go,

184
00:03:29,991 --> 00:03:29,983
&nbsp

185
00:03:29,993 --> 00:03:31,782
there was an envelope delivered for you

186
00:03:31,792 --> 00:03:31,784
&nbsp

187
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,651
from the Central City Opera.

188
00:03:33,661 --> 00:03:33,653
&nbsp

189
00:03:33,663 --> 00:03:36,904
Yes, you'd mentioned that
you'd never gone before, so...

190
00:03:36,914 --> 00:03:36,906
&nbsp

191
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:40,263
well, I got them for us
a while back, but now...

192
00:03:40,273 --> 00:03:40,910
&nbsp

193
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,661
just go with whoever you'd like.

194
00:03:42,671 --> 00:03:45,915
&nbsp

195
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:47,380
Huh.

196
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:47,584
&nbsp

197
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,300
Looks like things between you and Julian

198
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:49,302
&nbsp

199
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,669
are a little frosty, huh?

200
00:03:51,679 --> 00:03:52,364
&nbsp

201
00:03:52,374 --> 00:03:53,721
It's too soon for the cold puns?

202
00:03:53,731 --> 00:03:53,723
&nbsp

203
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,723
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Thought so.

204
00:03:55,733 --> 00:03:56,893
&nbsp

205
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,476
He still doesn't trust me after I lied

206
00:03:58,486 --> 00:03:58,478
&nbsp

207
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,845
about taking a piece of
the Philosopher's Stone.

208
00:04:00,855 --> 00:04:00,847
&nbsp

209
00:04:00,857 --> 00:04:02,386
You did what you felt you needed to do

210
00:04:02,396 --> 00:04:02,411
&nbsp

211
00:04:02,421 --> 00:04:03,621
to get rid of your powers.

212
00:04:03,631 --> 00:04:03,646
&nbsp

213
00:04:03,656 --> 00:04:07,064
I know that and you know that, but he...

214
00:04:07,074 --> 00:04:07,353
&nbsp

215
00:04:07,363 --> 00:04:09,769
He'll come around. Watch.

216
00:04:09,779 --> 00:04:09,939
&nbsp

217
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:12,690
I don't know that he will, Cisco.

218
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:21,951
&nbsp

219
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:23,834
Hey, Bar. Anything?

220
00:04:23,844 --> 00:04:23,836
&nbsp

221
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,953
Nothing yet.

222
00:04:25,963 --> 00:04:25,955
&nbsp

223
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:27,872
How the hell did this
thing get filled with water

224
00:04:27,882 --> 00:04:27,874
&nbsp

225
00:04:27,884 --> 00:04:31,077
and those poor dudes
get trapped in here?

226
00:04:31,087 --> 00:04:31,102
&nbsp

227
00:04:31,112 --> 00:04:32,710
Beats me.

228
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:32,712
&nbsp

229
00:04:32,722 --> 00:04:34,712
There's no water access
in the entire wing.

230
00:04:34,722 --> 00:04:34,714
&nbsp

231
00:04:34,724 --> 00:04:36,380
Instead of sprinklers, every floor uses

232
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:36,382
&nbsp

233
00:04:36,392 --> 00:04:38,549
a halon gas system that
absorbs all the oxygen

234
00:04:38,559 --> 00:04:38,551
&nbsp

235
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:40,051
if there's a fire.

236
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:40,076
&nbsp

237
00:04:40,086 --> 00:04:42,070
What about the security cams?

238
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,095
&nbsp

239
00:04:42,105 --> 00:04:43,234
None of them either.

240
00:04:43,244 --> 00:04:43,259
&nbsp

241
00:04:43,269 --> 00:04:44,472
Apparently, the Stagg geniuses

242
00:04:44,482 --> 00:04:44,474
&nbsp

243
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:45,812
don't want any of their "secrets"

244
00:04:45,822 --> 00:04:45,837
&nbsp

245
00:04:45,847 --> 00:04:47,164
- to get out.
- Yeah.

246
00:04:47,174 --> 00:04:47,189
&nbsp

247
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,456
Julian, please tell
me you found something.

248
00:04:49,466 --> 00:04:49,481
&nbsp

249
00:04:49,491 --> 00:04:50,611
Nothing yet, Detective.

250
00:04:50,621 --> 00:04:50,613
&nbsp

251
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:51,896
No fingerprints, no DNA,

252
00:04:51,906 --> 00:04:51,898
&nbsp

253
00:04:51,908 --> 00:04:55,066
just two rather plump looking corpses.

254
00:04:55,076 --> 00:04:55,068
&nbsp

255
00:04:55,078 --> 00:04:56,367
What about the stolen tech?

256
00:04:56,377 --> 00:04:56,369
&nbsp

257
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,818
Nothing. No one's saying a thing.

258
00:04:57,828 --> 00:04:57,820
&nbsp

259
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,848
Everyone is incredibly
tight-lipped about it.

260
00:04:59,858 --> 00:04:59,873
&nbsp

261
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:02,156
Of course they are. Look,
I'll make some phone calls,

262
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:02,158
&nbsp

263
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:04,145
see if I can pry those
lips open, all right?

264
00:05:04,155 --> 00:05:04,170
&nbsp

265
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,327
Okay. I'll keep working on it.

266
00:05:06,337 --> 00:05:06,329
&nbsp

267
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:08,796
This is the last thing we need
to be dealing with right now.

268
00:05:08,806 --> 00:05:08,798
&nbsp

269
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,415
I feel the same way, but
we can't just do nothing.

270
00:05:11,425 --> 00:05:11,417
&nbsp

271
00:05:11,427 --> 00:05:13,334
Iris ain't gonna let
us get away with that.

272
00:05:13,344 --> 00:05:13,336
&nbsp

273
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:17,118
I know, Joe, but we're
running out of time.

274
00:05:17,128 --> 00:05:17,143
&nbsp

275
00:05:17,153 --> 00:05:20,092
That's why you and me need
to solve this case fast.

276
00:05:20,102 --> 00:05:20,093
&nbsp

277
00:05:20,103 --> 00:05:21,439
Yeah.

278
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:22,095
&nbsp

279
00:05:22,105 --> 00:05:26,230
Sometimes... I wish you hadn't
told me what was gonna happen.

280
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,289
&nbsp

281
00:05:27,299 --> 00:05:28,889
Yeah, I know.

282
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:29,102
&nbsp

283
00:05:29,112 --> 00:05:31,021
Hold on. Hey, what's up?

284
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:31,046
&nbsp

285
00:05:31,056 --> 00:05:32,937
Looks like we got a robbery in progress

286
00:05:32,947 --> 00:05:32,939
&nbsp

287
00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:34,605
over at Kord Industries.

288
00:05:34,615 --> 00:05:34,607
&nbsp

289
00:05:34,617 --> 00:05:37,024
Great, thanks. Now Kord Industries.

290
00:05:37,034 --> 00:05:37,026
&nbsp

291
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:38,192
That's two in one day.

292
00:05:38,202 --> 00:05:38,194
&nbsp

293
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:39,827
That's two in under 12 hours.

294
00:05:39,837 --> 00:05:39,829
&nbsp

295
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,461
Yeah, I'm gonna make
sure it's the last one.

296
00:05:41,471 --> 00:05:52,508
&nbsp

297
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,291
I don't think that's yours, pal.

298
00:05:54,301 --> 00:05:54,293
&nbsp

299
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,581
Flash.

300
00:05:55,591 --> 00:05:55,606
&nbsp

301
00:05:55,616 --> 00:05:56,962
You didn't think I'd want to come meet

302
00:05:56,972 --> 00:05:56,963
&nbsp

303
00:05:56,973 --> 00:05:58,879
the newest resident of Iron Heights?

304
00:05:58,889 --> 00:05:58,881
&nbsp

305
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:00,798
No, I assumed that you'd show.

306
00:06:00,808 --> 00:06:00,800
&nbsp

307
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,715
I just didn't expect you to be so young,

308
00:06:03,725 --> 00:06:03,740
&nbsp

309
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,220
Barry... Allen.

310
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:06,222
&nbsp

311
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:08,222
Now, how do you know who I am?

312
00:06:08,232 --> 00:06:08,224
&nbsp

313
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:10,391
I'm from the future.

314
00:06:10,401 --> 00:06:10,393
&nbsp

315
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:13,060
You don't believe me?
Let's see, uh, 2017.

316
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:13,062
&nbsp

317
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:16,397
Hmm. How are things going
with your doomed love,

318
00:06:16,407 --> 00:06:16,399
&nbsp

319
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:17,780
Iris West?

320
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:17,874
&nbsp

321
00:06:17,884 --> 00:06:21,912
Or your greatest foe, Savitar?

322
00:06:21,922 --> 00:06:23,406
&nbsp

323
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,822
You know Savitar.

324
00:06:24,832 --> 00:06:24,824
&nbsp

325
00:06:24,834 --> 00:06:29,113
I know everything about him, and you.

326
00:06:29,123 --> 00:06:30,877
&nbsp

327
00:06:30,887 --> 00:06:32,243
What the...

328
00:06:32,253 --> 00:06:39,672
&nbsp

329
00:06:39,682 --> 00:06:40,707
Gypsy.

330
00:06:40,717 --> 00:06:40,732
&nbsp

331
00:06:40,742 --> 00:06:42,423
Still seeking revenge, I see.

332
00:06:42,433 --> 00:06:42,425
&nbsp

333
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,175
I'm gonna get it this time.

334
00:06:44,185 --> 00:06:44,200
&nbsp

335
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,724
We'll see.

336
00:06:45,734 --> 00:06:45,749
&nbsp

337
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,894
No!

338
00:06:46,904 --> 00:07:04,117
&nbsp

339
00:07:04,127 --> 00:07:06,475
He calls himself Abra Kadabra.

340
00:07:06,485 --> 00:07:06,500
&nbsp

341
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,832
As in hocus pocus?

342
00:07:07,842 --> 00:07:07,834
&nbsp

343
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,605
He's certainly got a lot of tricks.

344
00:07:09,615 --> 00:07:09,630
&nbsp

345
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,164
Yeah, we think he has
some sort of nanotechnology

346
00:07:12,174 --> 00:07:12,166
&nbsp

347
00:07:12,176 --> 00:07:13,499
built into his body...

348
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:13,501
&nbsp

349
00:07:13,511 --> 00:07:15,801
allows him to do some
extraordinary feats.

350
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:15,803
&nbsp

351
00:07:15,813 --> 00:07:18,470
Teleportation, telekinesis, you name it,

352
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:18,472
&nbsp

353
00:07:18,482 --> 00:07:20,195
and believe me, I have seen it all.

354
00:07:20,205 --> 00:07:20,220
&nbsp

355
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:22,516
So that card trick he played on Barry,

356
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:22,541
&nbsp

357
00:07:22,551 --> 00:07:24,289
the water tank at Stagg,

358
00:07:24,299 --> 00:07:24,314
&nbsp

359
00:07:24,324 --> 00:07:27,213
that's all some futuristic
tech that he's masking as magic?

360
00:07:27,223 --> 00:07:27,215
&nbsp

361
00:07:27,225 --> 00:07:29,148
Well, it's Arthur C. Clarke's third law.

362
00:07:29,158 --> 00:07:29,150
&nbsp

363
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,250
"Any sufficiently
advanced technology is...

364
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:31,252
&nbsp

365
00:07:31,262 --> 00:07:33,436
"... indistinguishable from magic."

366
00:07:33,446 --> 00:07:33,461
&nbsp

367
00:07:33,471 --> 00:07:36,467
Before you showed up, he
said he was from the future.

368
00:07:36,477 --> 00:07:37,158
&nbsp

369
00:07:37,168 --> 00:07:38,357
The future?

370
00:07:38,367 --> 00:07:38,359
&nbsp

371
00:07:38,369 --> 00:07:40,659
He is, 64th Century.

372
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:40,661
&nbsp

373
00:07:40,671 --> 00:07:43,028
Great, another criminal from the future.

374
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:43,030
&nbsp

375
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,493
Haven't we had our fill of those guys?

376
00:07:44,503 --> 00:07:44,518
&nbsp

377
00:07:44,528 --> 00:07:46,752
64th Century.

378
00:07:46,762 --> 00:07:47,001
&nbsp

379
00:07:47,011 --> 00:07:49,837
What exactly are you after him for?

380
00:07:49,847 --> 00:07:50,104
&nbsp

381
00:07:50,114 --> 00:07:52,771
He's at the top of the
collectors' most wanted list.

382
00:07:52,781 --> 00:07:52,773
&nbsp

383
00:07:52,783 --> 00:07:54,940
Showed up on my Earth a few years back,

384
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:54,942
&nbsp

385
00:07:54,952 --> 00:07:56,308
did a string of robberies that ended

386
00:07:56,318 --> 00:07:56,310
&nbsp

387
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,833
with a lot of people losing their lives.

388
00:07:58,843 --> 00:07:58,979
&nbsp

389
00:07:58,989 --> 00:08:00,645
Showed up again a couple weeks ago,

390
00:08:00,655 --> 00:08:00,670
&nbsp

391
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,623
looted some tech companies, came here.

392
00:08:02,633 --> 00:08:02,701
&nbsp

393
00:08:02,711 --> 00:08:05,235
To do the same thing? Why?

394
00:08:05,245 --> 00:08:05,237
&nbsp

395
00:08:05,247 --> 00:08:07,370
He must have needed our
Earth's tech for something.

396
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:07,372
&nbsp

397
00:08:07,382 --> 00:08:09,858
Well, whatever it is, we can
definitely help you figure it out,

398
00:08:09,868 --> 00:08:09,883
&nbsp

399
00:08:09,893 --> 00:08:11,174
'cause I don't know about you guys,

400
00:08:11,184 --> 00:08:11,176
&nbsp

401
00:08:11,186 --> 00:08:12,657
but ever since last time you were here,

402
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:12,682
&nbsp

403
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:17,017
I've been looking forward
to some Gypsy-Vibe action.

404
00:08:17,027 --> 00:08:17,215
&nbsp

405
00:08:17,225 --> 00:08:19,482
- That's way too much.
- Embarrassing.

406
00:08:19,492 --> 00:08:19,484
&nbsp

407
00:08:19,494 --> 00:08:21,368
Yeah, I just want to catch
him so I can bring his ass

408
00:08:21,378 --> 00:08:21,393
&nbsp

409
00:08:21,403 --> 00:08:23,620
back to Earth-19 and put him down.

410
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:23,622
&nbsp

411
00:08:23,632 --> 00:08:25,539
Don't worry. We can help you do that.

412
00:08:25,549 --> 00:08:25,595
&nbsp

413
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:28,162
We should check and see if
Julian's gotten anything.

414
00:08:28,172 --> 00:08:28,164
&nbsp

415
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,686
I'll go ask him.

416
00:08:29,696 --> 00:08:30,099
&nbsp

417
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:32,199
In the meantime, we can figure out

418
00:08:32,209 --> 00:08:32,201
&nbsp

419
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:34,101
where this guy disappeared off to.

420
00:08:34,111 --> 00:08:34,103
&nbsp

421
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:36,337
- Lend me a hand?
- Stupid.

422
00:08:36,347 --> 00:08:38,174
&nbsp

423
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,607
I know that look.

424
00:08:39,617 --> 00:08:39,609
&nbsp

425
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:41,776
What is going on inside
that head of yours?

426
00:08:41,786 --> 00:08:42,998
&nbsp

427
00:08:43,008 --> 00:08:44,270
This guy knew what was going on

428
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:44,295
&nbsp

429
00:08:44,305 --> 00:08:46,433
with you and me and Savitar.

430
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:46,910
&nbsp

431
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,849
If he knows something
about Savitar, then...

432
00:08:48,859 --> 00:08:48,851
&nbsp

433
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,718
He might be the key to saving you.

434
00:08:50,728 --> 00:08:50,720
&nbsp

435
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,920
This is the first
real lead we've gotten.

436
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:52,922
&nbsp

437
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:54,455
But, guys, what about Gypsy?

438
00:08:54,465 --> 00:08:54,457
&nbsp

439
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:55,657
I mean, if she gets ahold of him,

440
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:55,682
&nbsp

441
00:08:55,692 --> 00:08:57,291
she's gonna take him back to Earth-19.

442
00:08:57,301 --> 00:08:57,293
&nbsp

443
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:59,060
We can figure that out later.

444
00:08:59,070 --> 00:08:59,062
&nbsp

445
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:00,761
Right now, we just need to find him.

446
00:09:00,771 --> 00:09:08,337
&nbsp

447
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:09,737
I got nothing.

448
00:09:09,747 --> 00:09:10,540
&nbsp

449
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,872
Why can't I find you?

450
00:09:11,882 --> 00:09:11,874
&nbsp

451
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,542
I told you, this guy is smart.

452
00:09:14,552 --> 00:09:14,544
&nbsp

453
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,310
You can't just vibe Kadabra's location.

454
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:16,312
&nbsp

455
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:19,346
Whatever he's doing, it
renders him invisible to us.

456
00:09:19,356 --> 00:09:19,348
&nbsp

457
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:20,981
Okay, well, if we can't vibe him,

458
00:09:20,991 --> 00:09:20,983
&nbsp

459
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:23,351
then I guess we'll have to
find him another way, right?

460
00:09:23,361 --> 00:09:28,458
&nbsp

461
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:29,467
What are you doing?

462
00:09:29,477 --> 00:09:29,492
&nbsp

463
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:32,840
I'm putting some search parameters
into the S.T.A.R. Labs satellite

464
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:32,865
&nbsp

465
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:35,013
to see if anybody vibrates
at a different frequency

466
00:09:35,023 --> 00:09:35,038
&nbsp

467
00:09:35,048 --> 00:09:36,831
than Earth-1 folk.

468
00:09:36,841 --> 00:09:36,833
&nbsp

469
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:39,451
Wish we had a satellite that
could do that on my Earth.

470
00:09:39,461 --> 00:09:39,724
&nbsp

471
00:09:39,734 --> 00:09:42,425
Wish I had a bunch of this stuff.

472
00:09:42,435 --> 00:09:42,896
&nbsp

473
00:09:42,906 --> 00:09:45,940
Oh. I could hook you up, girl.

474
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:46,060
&nbsp

475
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,639
How about this,

476
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:47,664
&nbsp

477
00:09:47,674 --> 00:09:50,740
I spend a few days on Earth-19,

478
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:50,947
&nbsp

479
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:54,448
and set you up with
something state-of-the-art.

480
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:54,450
&nbsp

481
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,683
You know, the only thing is,

482
00:09:55,693 --> 00:09:55,685
&nbsp

483
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:59,240
I would need a place to crash, so.

484
00:09:59,250 --> 00:09:59,982
&nbsp

485
00:09:59,992 --> 00:10:02,717
- Cisco...
- Gypsy.

486
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,462
&nbsp

487
00:10:04,472 --> 00:10:06,227
That kiss, that wasn't

488
00:10:06,237 --> 00:10:06,229
&nbsp

489
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:08,374
"I'll see you around."

490
00:10:08,384 --> 00:10:09,101
&nbsp

491
00:10:09,111 --> 00:10:11,234
That was like,

492
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:11,259
&nbsp

493
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:15,455
"That needs to happen again, real soon."

494
00:10:15,465 --> 00:10:20,848
&nbsp

495
00:10:20,858 --> 00:10:23,042
Or did I misread that?

496
00:10:23,052 --> 00:10:24,084
&nbsp

497
00:10:24,094 --> 00:10:26,918
I-I-I've been preoccupied.

498
00:10:26,928 --> 00:10:28,618
&nbsp

499
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,784
Is that the only reason?

500
00:10:30,794 --> 00:10:33,465
&nbsp

501
00:10:33,475 --> 00:10:35,418
Great timing!

502
00:10:35,428 --> 00:10:35,992
&nbsp

503
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:38,259
Looks like David Copperfield's
not too far from us.

504
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:38,261
&nbsp

505
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:40,327
He's at one of Mercury
Labs' satellite offices.

506
00:10:40,337 --> 00:10:40,329
&nbsp

507
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:42,763
- Another tech company?
- The techiest.

508
00:10:42,773 --> 00:10:42,765
&nbsp

509
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:45,105
Let's grab the speedsters and go.

510
00:10:45,115 --> 00:10:53,910
&nbsp

511
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,644
Man, you just can't
help yourself, can you?

512
00:10:56,654 --> 00:10:57,547
&nbsp

513
00:10:57,557 --> 00:10:59,442
You brought the whole team this time.

514
00:10:59,452 --> 00:10:59,467
&nbsp

515
00:10:59,477 --> 00:11:01,649
- Mm-hmm.
- That wasn't very smart, was it?

516
00:11:01,659 --> 00:11:01,651
&nbsp

517
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,651
Oh, this guy sucks.

518
00:11:03,661 --> 00:11:03,653
&nbsp

519
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,920
I can see why you want to
bring him down so badly.

520
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:05,922
&nbsp

521
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:07,940
Do yourself a favor, give it up.

522
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:07,965
&nbsp

523
00:11:07,975 --> 00:11:09,857
There's nowhere for you to go.

524
00:11:09,867 --> 00:11:09,859
&nbsp

525
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:12,176
You can't out-trick all of us, Kadabra.

526
00:11:12,186 --> 00:11:14,343
&nbsp

527
00:11:14,353 --> 00:11:16,106
I think I just did.

528
00:11:16,116 --> 00:11:16,870
&nbsp

529
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,714
He's a hologram.

530
00:11:18,724 --> 00:11:20,303
&nbsp

531
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:21,769
Upon further inspection,

532
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:21,771
&nbsp

533
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:24,171
there was some rather
odd particulate residue

534
00:11:24,181 --> 00:11:24,173
&nbsp

535
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,773
found at Stagg Industries.

536
00:11:25,783 --> 00:11:25,775
&nbsp

537
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:27,341
Yeah, that's the nanotechnology

538
00:11:27,351 --> 00:11:27,343
&nbsp

539
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,809
that Gypsy was talking about.

540
00:11:28,819 --> 00:11:28,811
&nbsp

541
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:30,144
But what's it made out of?

542
00:11:30,154 --> 00:11:30,146
&nbsp

543
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:31,493
Not exactly sure.

544
00:11:31,503 --> 00:11:31,518
&nbsp

545
00:11:31,528 --> 00:11:33,280
It's definitely organic,
but it seems to have

546
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:33,282
&nbsp

547
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:35,716
some sort of metallic
hydrogen properties.

548
00:11:35,726 --> 00:11:35,718
&nbsp

549
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:36,917
Frankly, it's...

550
00:11:36,927 --> 00:11:36,919
&nbsp

551
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:38,953
Beyond your understanding.

552
00:11:38,963 --> 00:11:38,955
&nbsp

553
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:40,754
You make a move, you'll regret it.

554
00:11:40,764 --> 00:11:40,756
&nbsp

555
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:44,167
Do you know how many times
I've heard that, Detective?

556
00:11:44,177 --> 00:11:46,829
&nbsp

557
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:48,190
Told you.

558
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,278
&nbsp

559
00:11:52,288 --> 00:11:53,724
Damn it.

560
00:11:53,734 --> 00:11:56,105
&nbsp

561
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:57,435
Go, go, go!

562
00:11:57,445 --> 00:12:01,963
&nbsp

563
00:12:01,973 --> 00:12:03,707
Guys, move to the side.

564
00:12:03,717 --> 00:12:12,610
&nbsp

565
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:16,278
Now... I can get what I came for.

566
00:12:16,288 --> 00:12:17,126
&nbsp

567
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:19,360
Everybody okay?

568
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:21,163
&nbsp

569
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:23,497
Magic or tech, doesn't matter.
You're not getting out of these.

570
00:12:23,507 --> 00:12:23,499
&nbsp

571
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,466
Maybe not.

572
00:12:25,476 --> 00:12:25,468
&nbsp

573
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:28,535
You let me go, I will tell
you Savitar's greatest secret.

574
00:12:28,545 --> 00:12:28,537
&nbsp

575
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:31,772
It's the key to defeating
him, the key to stopping him.

576
00:12:31,782 --> 00:12:31,774
&nbsp

577
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:34,518
- What secret?
- I know who he is.

578
00:12:34,528 --> 00:12:34,782
&nbsp

579
00:12:34,792 --> 00:12:36,477
I know his name.

580
00:12:36,487 --> 00:12:37,880
&nbsp

581
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,378
Hand him over!

582
00:12:39,388 --> 00:12:51,852
&nbsp

583
00:12:51,862 --> 00:12:53,695
Why'd you lock him up?

584
00:12:53,705 --> 00:12:54,216
&nbsp

585
00:12:54,226 --> 00:12:55,782
I'm taking him right back to my Earth.

586
00:12:55,792 --> 00:12:55,784
&nbsp

587
00:12:55,794 --> 00:12:58,418
Okay, but I need to talk to him first.

588
00:12:58,428 --> 00:12:59,888
&nbsp

589
00:12:59,898 --> 00:13:01,888
Fine. Get what you need from him,

590
00:13:01,898 --> 00:13:01,890
&nbsp

591
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,367
but when you're done, he's mine.

592
00:13:04,377 --> 00:13:09,331
&nbsp

593
00:13:09,341 --> 00:13:12,608
You are gonna die for all
the things you've done.

594
00:13:12,618 --> 00:13:13,057
&nbsp

595
00:13:13,067 --> 00:13:16,459
I cannot wait to see
you be put to death.

596
00:13:16,469 --> 00:13:22,677
&nbsp

597
00:13:22,687 --> 00:13:26,053
Uh, I'm gonna talk to her.

598
00:13:26,063 --> 00:13:26,646
&nbsp

599
00:13:26,656 --> 00:13:28,169
Gypsy, darling?

600
00:13:28,179 --> 00:13:31,119
&nbsp

601
00:13:31,129 --> 00:13:33,286
You said you know who Savitar is.

602
00:13:33,296 --> 00:13:33,548
&nbsp

603
00:13:33,558 --> 00:13:37,435
I know everything
about the God of Speed,

604
00:13:37,445 --> 00:13:38,226
&nbsp

605
00:13:38,236 --> 00:13:40,527
hallowed be his name.

606
00:13:40,537 --> 00:13:41,363
&nbsp

607
00:13:41,373 --> 00:13:42,692
Like what?

608
00:13:42,702 --> 00:13:43,932
&nbsp

609
00:13:43,942 --> 00:13:45,331
That he's unstoppable,

610
00:13:45,341 --> 00:13:45,333
&nbsp

611
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,834
that he was the first speedster,

612
00:13:47,844 --> 00:13:47,836
&nbsp

613
00:13:47,846 --> 00:13:49,836
and that you defeat him,

614
00:13:49,846 --> 00:13:49,838
&nbsp

615
00:13:49,848 --> 00:13:54,199
but not until after he takes
what matters the most to you...

616
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:54,527
&nbsp

617
00:13:54,537 --> 00:13:55,960
Iris West.

618
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:56,111
&nbsp

619
00:13:56,121 --> 00:13:58,263
Tell us who he is, now!

620
00:13:58,273 --> 00:13:58,924
&nbsp

621
00:13:58,934 --> 00:14:00,824
I don't think so.

622
00:14:00,834 --> 00:14:00,849
&nbsp

623
00:14:00,859 --> 00:14:02,843
It's frustrating, isn't it,

624
00:14:02,853 --> 00:14:02,868
&nbsp

625
00:14:02,878 --> 00:14:05,669
knowing that you're going to die

626
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:05,821
&nbsp

627
00:14:05,831 --> 00:14:09,022
unless I give The Flash what he wants.

628
00:14:09,032 --> 00:14:09,157
&nbsp

629
00:14:09,167 --> 00:14:11,765
All that power, all that speed,

630
00:14:11,775 --> 00:14:11,790
&nbsp

631
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,926
and yet you're still too slow.

632
00:14:15,936 --> 00:14:16,231
&nbsp

633
00:14:16,241 --> 00:14:18,031
This isn't a game or a trick.

634
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:18,033
&nbsp

635
00:14:18,043 --> 00:14:19,866
This is about my daughter's life.

636
00:14:19,876 --> 00:14:19,868
&nbsp

637
00:14:19,878 --> 00:14:21,601
And it's my life

638
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:21,603
&nbsp

639
00:14:21,613 --> 00:14:24,704
if you hand me over to that collector.

640
00:14:24,714 --> 00:14:24,706
&nbsp

641
00:14:24,716 --> 00:14:26,577
It's simple.

642
00:14:26,587 --> 00:14:26,741
&nbsp

643
00:14:26,751 --> 00:14:31,244
Let me out, and I'll
tell you who Savitar is.

644
00:14:31,254 --> 00:14:31,246
&nbsp

645
00:14:31,256 --> 00:14:35,582
Give me to Gypsy, and Iris dies.

646
00:14:35,592 --> 00:14:35,584
&nbsp

647
00:14:35,594 --> 00:14:38,852
The decision lies with you, Barry.

648
00:14:38,862 --> 00:14:46,494
&nbsp

649
00:14:46,504 --> 00:14:48,561
Guys, we can't let Gypsy take him

650
00:14:48,571 --> 00:14:48,563
&nbsp

651
00:14:48,573 --> 00:14:50,295
before we find out who Savitar is.

652
00:14:50,305 --> 00:14:50,320
&nbsp

653
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:51,552
No, we cannot.

654
00:14:51,562 --> 00:14:51,577
&nbsp

655
00:14:51,587 --> 00:14:53,248
Then what are we supposed to do?

656
00:14:53,258 --> 00:14:55,437
&nbsp

657
00:14:55,447 --> 00:14:56,764
I don't know.

658
00:14:56,774 --> 00:14:57,472
&nbsp

659
00:14:57,482 --> 00:14:59,439
What is it with you and this guy?

660
00:14:59,449 --> 00:14:59,441
&nbsp

661
00:14:59,451 --> 00:15:01,507
It's like you're hell-bent
on taking him back with you.

662
00:15:01,517 --> 00:15:01,509
&nbsp

663
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,943
He killed a lot of people on Earth-19.

664
00:15:03,953 --> 00:15:03,945
&nbsp

665
00:15:03,955 --> 00:15:05,812
He's killed people here too.

666
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:05,814
&nbsp

667
00:15:05,824 --> 00:15:07,744
No one you know or care about.

668
00:15:07,754 --> 00:15:08,812
&nbsp

669
00:15:08,822 --> 00:15:10,994
Did he take somebody from you?

670
00:15:11,004 --> 00:15:11,887
&nbsp

671
00:15:11,897 --> 00:15:13,219
Hey.

672
00:15:13,229 --> 00:15:13,221
&nbsp

673
00:15:13,231 --> 00:15:14,821
Is that what this is about?

674
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:14,823
&nbsp

675
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,689
What this is about, Cisco,

676
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:16,691
&nbsp

677
00:15:16,701 --> 00:15:18,491
is he needs to be brought to justice,

678
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:18,493
&nbsp

679
00:15:18,503 --> 00:15:21,728
and I am not gonna
let anything or anyone

680
00:15:21,738 --> 00:15:21,730
&nbsp

681
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,482
prevent me from doing that.

682
00:15:23,492 --> 00:15:28,370
&nbsp

683
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,903
You're lucky.

684
00:15:29,913 --> 00:15:29,905
&nbsp

685
00:15:29,915 --> 00:15:31,571
This could've been a lot worse.

686
00:15:31,581 --> 00:15:31,573
&nbsp

687
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,600
I'm fine, really.

688
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:33,625
&nbsp

689
00:15:33,635 --> 00:15:34,690
It's merely a flesh wound,

690
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:34,715
&nbsp

691
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:37,295
as the "Monty Python" boys would say.

692
00:15:37,305 --> 00:15:38,079
&nbsp

693
00:15:38,089 --> 00:15:40,264
Anyway, thanks for patching me up.

694
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:40,415
&nbsp

695
00:15:40,425 --> 00:15:41,756
Of course.

696
00:15:41,766 --> 00:15:43,538
&nbsp

697
00:15:43,548 --> 00:15:44,838
Listen, I've been trying to find

698
00:15:44,848 --> 00:15:44,863
&nbsp

699
00:15:44,873 --> 00:15:47,063
the right time to say this, and...

700
00:15:47,073 --> 00:15:47,222
&nbsp

701
00:15:47,232 --> 00:15:49,811
now seems to be as good a time as any.

702
00:15:49,821 --> 00:15:52,460
&nbsp

703
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:55,683
I was so focused on not hurting you...

704
00:15:55,693 --> 00:15:55,708
&nbsp

705
00:15:55,718 --> 00:15:57,497
as Killer Frost...

706
00:15:57,507 --> 00:15:57,499
&nbsp

707
00:15:57,509 --> 00:16:01,136
that I forgot that I could
hurt you as Caitlin Snow,

708
00:16:01,146 --> 00:16:01,369
&nbsp

709
00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:03,667
and for that I'm very sorry.

710
00:16:03,677 --> 00:16:03,692
&nbsp

711
00:16:03,702 --> 00:16:06,136
So I understand...

712
00:16:06,146 --> 00:16:06,161
&nbsp

713
00:16:06,171 --> 00:16:08,995
if you don't trust me anymore, but...

714
00:16:09,005 --> 00:16:09,844
&nbsp

715
00:16:09,854 --> 00:16:12,878
maybe you can find it in
your heart to forgive me?

716
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:19,387
&nbsp

717
00:16:19,397 --> 00:16:20,787
You're good to go.

718
00:16:20,797 --> 00:16:36,604
&nbsp

719
00:16:36,614 --> 00:16:38,096
Thank you.

720
00:16:38,106 --> 00:16:39,841
&nbsp

721
00:16:39,851 --> 00:16:41,774
We're gonna figure this out, Barry.

722
00:16:41,784 --> 00:16:41,776
&nbsp

723
00:16:41,786 --> 00:16:43,476
A guy like Kadabra,

724
00:16:43,486 --> 00:16:43,478
&nbsp

725
00:16:43,488 --> 00:16:46,145
he should have no say
whether you live or die.

726
00:16:46,155 --> 00:16:46,170
&nbsp

727
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:48,491
How do you even know that
he's telling the truth?

728
00:16:48,501 --> 00:16:48,516
&nbsp

729
00:16:48,526 --> 00:16:51,193
I mean, he's done nothing
but tricks since he got here.

730
00:16:51,203 --> 00:16:51,218
&nbsp

731
00:16:51,228 --> 00:16:53,186
I mean, maybe... maybe
this is one of them.

732
00:16:53,196 --> 00:16:53,188
&nbsp

733
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:54,795
It's not, Iris.

734
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:55,290
&nbsp

735
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:58,558
So... what, you want to let him go?

736
00:16:58,568 --> 00:17:01,234
&nbsp

737
00:17:01,244 --> 00:17:03,740
I mean, it just feels
like our only move.

738
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,332
&nbsp

739
00:17:04,342 --> 00:17:05,665
He's a murderer.

740
00:17:05,675 --> 00:17:05,667
&nbsp

741
00:17:05,677 --> 00:17:07,166
I know he's a murderer,

742
00:17:07,176 --> 00:17:07,168
&nbsp

743
00:17:07,178 --> 00:17:09,771
but I mean, how many murderers
have we put in prison?

744
00:17:09,781 --> 00:17:09,796
&nbsp

745
00:17:09,806 --> 00:17:11,871
How many bad guys have we taken down?

746
00:17:11,881 --> 00:17:11,873
&nbsp

747
00:17:11,883 --> 00:17:13,334
I mean, don't we deserve one win

748
00:17:13,344 --> 00:17:13,359
&nbsp

749
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:14,640
after everything that we've done?

750
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:14,642
&nbsp

751
00:17:14,652 --> 00:17:17,694
Life doesn't keep score, Barry.

752
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:20,281
&nbsp

753
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:22,382
You should know that better than anyone.

754
00:17:22,392 --> 00:17:22,384
&nbsp

755
00:17:22,394 --> 00:17:25,485
Look, even if Kadabra hadn't showed up,

756
00:17:25,495 --> 00:17:25,487
&nbsp

757
00:17:25,497 --> 00:17:27,787
we'd still be in the same
place we are right now.

758
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:27,789
&nbsp

759
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:29,389
But he did, and if he knows

760
00:17:29,399 --> 00:17:29,391
&nbsp

761
00:17:29,401 --> 00:17:31,057
who Savitar is, he's gonna tell us.

762
00:17:31,067 --> 00:17:31,059
&nbsp

763
00:17:31,069 --> 00:17:33,226
- Barry...
- Iris, he can save your life.

764
00:17:33,236 --> 00:17:33,228
&nbsp

765
00:17:33,238 --> 00:17:35,995
No, you can save my life.

766
00:17:36,005 --> 00:17:36,831
&nbsp

767
00:17:36,841 --> 00:17:37,897
Not him.

768
00:17:37,907 --> 00:17:39,013
&nbsp

769
00:17:39,023 --> 00:17:41,434
Trust me, I want to
find out who Savitar is

770
00:17:41,444 --> 00:17:41,436
&nbsp

771
00:17:41,446 --> 00:17:43,669
just as badly as you do.

772
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:43,671
&nbsp

773
00:17:43,681 --> 00:17:47,140
But I don't want to let someone
who has caused so much pain

774
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:47,142
&nbsp

775
00:17:47,152 --> 00:17:49,582
walk free just to save my life.

776
00:17:49,592 --> 00:17:51,356
&nbsp

777
00:17:51,366 --> 00:17:53,346
And you know, deep down,

778
00:17:53,356 --> 00:17:53,348
&nbsp

779
00:17:53,358 --> 00:17:55,653
I don't think you want that either.

780
00:17:55,663 --> 00:18:07,595
&nbsp

781
00:18:07,605 --> 00:18:09,220
I knew you'd come.

782
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,433
&nbsp

783
00:18:11,443 --> 00:18:14,775
'Cause you're the only
person who's willing to do...

784
00:18:14,785 --> 00:18:15,003
&nbsp

785
00:18:15,013 --> 00:18:16,369
anything.

786
00:18:16,379 --> 00:18:16,371
&nbsp

787
00:18:16,381 --> 00:18:18,080
What do you want?

788
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:18,406
&nbsp

789
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,406
To be set free.

790
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:20,408
&nbsp

791
00:18:20,418 --> 00:18:24,236
Murdering people, stealing smart tech.

792
00:18:24,246 --> 00:18:24,261
&nbsp

793
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:26,379
You came here for something.

794
00:18:26,389 --> 00:18:26,381
&nbsp

795
00:18:26,391 --> 00:18:28,494
Told you before, Detective,

796
00:18:28,504 --> 00:18:29,126
&nbsp

797
00:18:29,136 --> 00:18:32,718
it is beyond your understanding.

798
00:18:32,728 --> 00:18:33,922
&nbsp

799
00:18:33,932 --> 00:18:36,556
This is about my daughter's life.

800
00:18:36,566 --> 00:18:37,678
&nbsp

801
00:18:37,688 --> 00:18:39,653
It's as simple as that for me.

802
00:18:39,663 --> 00:18:40,061
&nbsp

803
00:18:40,071 --> 00:18:43,278
You tell me who Savitar is,

804
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,432
&nbsp

805
00:18:44,442 --> 00:18:46,632
and I will let you go.

806
00:18:46,642 --> 00:18:46,634
&nbsp

807
00:18:46,644 --> 00:18:49,997
You don't, you're going with Gypsy.

808
00:18:50,007 --> 00:18:50,442
&nbsp

809
00:18:50,452 --> 00:18:52,905
A leap of faith for us both then.

810
00:18:52,915 --> 00:18:54,565
&nbsp

811
00:18:54,575 --> 00:18:56,168
Open the door.

812
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:56,811
&nbsp

813
00:18:56,821 --> 00:19:00,646
If you take one step before you tell me,

814
00:19:00,656 --> 00:19:00,648
&nbsp

815
00:19:00,658 --> 00:19:04,183
I will blow you away. Understood?

816
00:19:04,193 --> 00:19:12,594
&nbsp

817
00:19:12,604 --> 00:19:13,960
But you do not know this guy.

818
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:13,962
&nbsp

819
00:19:13,972 --> 00:19:15,483
Great timing!

820
00:19:15,493 --> 00:19:16,131
&nbsp

821
00:19:16,141 --> 00:19:17,130
What is that?

822
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,299
&nbsp

823
00:19:18,309 --> 00:19:20,053
- No.
- Gypsy!

824
00:19:20,063 --> 00:19:23,171
&nbsp

825
00:19:23,181 --> 00:19:24,537
Give me the name.

826
00:19:24,547 --> 00:19:25,974
&nbsp

827
00:19:25,984 --> 00:19:28,374
The name, now!

828
00:19:28,384 --> 00:19:28,399
&nbsp

829
00:19:28,409 --> 00:19:31,177
Savitar... is...

830
00:19:31,187 --> 00:19:31,179
&nbsp

831
00:19:31,189 --> 00:19:33,646
No! What the hell are you doing?

832
00:19:33,656 --> 00:19:34,932
&nbsp

833
00:19:34,942 --> 00:19:37,717
He was about to tell me who Savitar is!

834
00:19:37,727 --> 00:19:37,719
&nbsp

835
00:19:37,729 --> 00:19:39,152
Damn it!

836
00:19:39,162 --> 00:19:41,489
&nbsp

837
00:19:41,499 --> 00:19:44,023
- Kadabra's on the loose!
- He's somewhere in the building!

838
00:19:44,033 --> 00:19:54,435
&nbsp

839
00:19:54,445 --> 00:19:55,799
And there we are.

840
00:19:55,809 --> 00:20:01,817
&nbsp

841
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:04,340
Thank you, Doctor Wells.

842
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:07,282
&nbsp

843
00:20:07,292 --> 00:20:09,377
Joe, he's headed for the elevator!

844
00:20:09,387 --> 00:20:22,597
&nbsp

845
00:20:22,607 --> 00:20:24,447
We had a deal.

846
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:25,266
&nbsp

847
00:20:25,276 --> 00:20:28,234
Your freedom for Savitar's identity.

848
00:20:28,244 --> 00:20:28,236
&nbsp

849
00:20:28,246 --> 00:20:30,503
I've altered the terms of our agreement.

850
00:20:30,513 --> 00:20:30,505
&nbsp

851
00:20:30,515 --> 00:20:32,988
It appears that you have as well.

852
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:33,013
&nbsp

853
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,379
Move!

854
00:20:34,389 --> 00:20:48,623
&nbsp

855
00:20:48,633 --> 00:20:50,197
Caitlin! Caitlin, are you all right?

856
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:50,220
&nbsp

857
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:51,319
- You all right?
- Yeah.

858
00:20:51,329 --> 00:20:51,321
&nbsp

859
00:20:51,331 --> 00:20:52,386
- Come on.
- I'm okay.

860
00:20:52,396 --> 00:20:52,389
&nbsp

861
00:20:52,399 --> 00:20:53,502
Okay, I'm okay.

862
00:20:53,512 --> 00:21:03,254
&nbsp

863
00:21:03,264 --> 00:21:04,961
Okay, okay, easy.

864
00:21:04,971 --> 00:21:04,986
&nbsp

865
00:21:04,996 --> 00:21:06,152
Easy.

866
00:21:06,162 --> 00:21:06,177
&nbsp

867
00:21:06,187 --> 00:21:07,196
Come on. Gentle, gentle.

868
00:21:07,206 --> 00:21:07,221
&nbsp

869
00:21:07,231 --> 00:21:08,299
Yeah, yeah, yup.

870
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:08,324
&nbsp

871
00:21:08,334 --> 00:21:09,914
The, um, the... hand
me the X-ray machine,

872
00:21:09,924 --> 00:21:09,939
&nbsp

873
00:21:09,949 --> 00:21:12,119
- grab it for us, would you, please?
- Yup.

874
00:21:12,129 --> 00:21:12,463
&nbsp

875
00:21:12,473 --> 00:21:13,674
Here, here.

876
00:21:13,684 --> 00:21:13,676
&nbsp

877
00:21:13,686 --> 00:21:15,476
Okay, good. remove it.

878
00:21:15,486 --> 00:21:15,478
&nbsp

879
00:21:15,488 --> 00:21:17,955
- How bad is it?
- Uh, it's bad.

880
00:21:17,965 --> 00:21:17,980
&nbsp

881
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:20,169
It's bad, there's quite a few
pieces of shrapnel inside you,

882
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:20,194
&nbsp

883
00:21:20,204 --> 00:21:21,693
and they look deep enough
to pierce your kidney

884
00:21:21,703 --> 00:21:21,695
&nbsp

885
00:21:21,705 --> 00:21:23,580
if they're not removed immediately.

886
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:23,605
&nbsp

887
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,111
Guys, we have to get her to a hospital.

888
00:21:25,121 --> 00:21:25,136
&nbsp

889
00:21:25,146 --> 00:21:26,486
We can't, they're
gonna ID her as a meta.

890
00:21:26,496 --> 00:21:26,511
&nbsp

891
00:21:26,521 --> 00:21:27,846
And not just any meta.

892
00:21:27,856 --> 00:21:27,871
&nbsp

893
00:21:27,881 --> 00:21:30,172
Yeah, one that we have a
file on for attacking CCPD.

894
00:21:30,182 --> 00:21:30,197
&nbsp

895
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:32,181
Then what are we going to
do? None of us are doctors

896
00:21:32,191 --> 00:21:32,206
&nbsp

897
00:21:32,216 --> 00:21:34,273
and she can't operate on herself.

898
00:21:34,283 --> 00:21:34,275
&nbsp

899
00:21:34,285 --> 00:21:35,741
We do have another option.

900
00:21:35,751 --> 00:21:35,743
&nbsp

901
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:36,775
What is it?

902
00:21:36,785 --> 00:21:36,800
&nbsp

903
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:38,877
When Caitlin goes
meta, her metabolic rate

904
00:21:38,887 --> 00:21:38,902
&nbsp

905
00:21:38,912 --> 00:21:40,314
offsets cold tissue destruction.

906
00:21:40,324 --> 00:21:40,339
&nbsp

907
00:21:40,349 --> 00:21:41,432
She can regenerate?

908
00:21:41,442 --> 00:21:41,457
&nbsp

909
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:43,304
No, we're not gonna
take off my necklace.

910
00:21:43,314 --> 00:21:43,329
&nbsp

911
00:21:43,339 --> 00:21:44,588
I don't need a hospital.

912
00:21:44,598 --> 00:21:44,613
&nbsp

913
00:21:44,623 --> 00:21:47,047
All I need is a mirror
and a steady set of hands.

914
00:21:47,057 --> 00:21:47,072
&nbsp

915
00:21:47,082 --> 00:21:49,300
You were a field medic
in the Royal Army, right?

916
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:49,302
&nbsp

917
00:21:49,312 --> 00:21:51,835
What? No, I-I-I've never
operated on anyone before.

918
00:21:51,845 --> 00:21:51,837
&nbsp

919
00:21:51,847 --> 00:21:53,470
That's okay, I'll walk you through it.

920
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:53,472
&nbsp

921
00:21:53,482 --> 00:21:55,137
Caitlin, you're talking
about staying awake

922
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:55,162
&nbsp

923
00:21:55,172 --> 00:21:56,226
during your own surgery.

924
00:21:56,236 --> 00:21:56,289
&nbsp

925
00:21:56,299 --> 00:21:57,788
I'm putting my life in your hands.

926
00:21:57,798 --> 00:21:57,790
&nbsp

927
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,468
I trust you, Julian.

928
00:21:59,478 --> 00:22:08,234
&nbsp

929
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:10,629
What the hell were you thinking?

930
00:22:10,639 --> 00:22:11,070
&nbsp

931
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,670
Now is not the time, Gypsy.

932
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:12,672
&nbsp

933
00:22:12,682 --> 00:22:14,905
You know, you got a really
messed up sense of justice

934
00:22:14,915 --> 00:22:14,907
&nbsp

935
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:16,433
for a cop?

936
00:22:16,443 --> 00:22:17,310
&nbsp

937
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,447
Watch yourself.

938
00:22:18,457 --> 00:22:18,472
&nbsp

939
00:22:18,482 --> 00:22:20,945
I took two oaths in my life.

940
00:22:20,955 --> 00:22:20,947
&nbsp

941
00:22:20,957 --> 00:22:24,143
One, to uphold the law. The
other, to protect my family.

942
00:22:24,153 --> 00:22:24,168
&nbsp

943
00:22:24,178 --> 00:22:25,634
Guess which one takes priority?

944
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:25,636
&nbsp

945
00:22:25,646 --> 00:22:27,238
That was my prisoner.

946
00:22:27,248 --> 00:22:27,263
&nbsp

947
00:22:27,273 --> 00:22:29,315
He was my prisoner too,
and you're on my Earth.

948
00:22:29,325 --> 00:22:29,340
&nbsp

949
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:32,136
He has information that
could save Iris's life,

950
00:22:32,146 --> 00:22:32,161
&nbsp

951
00:22:32,171 --> 00:22:34,009
so I don't give a damn!

952
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:34,011
&nbsp

953
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:35,644
It's because of you he's on the loose.

954
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:35,646
&nbsp

955
00:22:35,656 --> 00:22:38,080
Because of me? No, no, because of you.

956
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:38,082
&nbsp

957
00:22:38,092 --> 00:22:40,283
You opened that door! You let him out!

958
00:22:40,293 --> 00:22:40,308
&nbsp

959
00:22:40,318 --> 00:22:42,609
That is on you, Detective!

960
00:22:42,619 --> 00:22:48,159
&nbsp

961
00:22:48,169 --> 00:22:50,025
How much of that did you hear?

962
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:50,027
&nbsp

963
00:22:50,037 --> 00:22:51,393
I heard enough.

964
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:51,395
&nbsp

965
00:22:51,405 --> 00:22:52,728
This is my friend.

966
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:52,730
&nbsp

967
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,830
It's the man's daughter.

968
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:54,832
&nbsp

969
00:22:54,842 --> 00:22:56,699
I mean, wouldn't you do that
for someone you cared about?

970
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:56,701
&nbsp

971
00:22:56,711 --> 00:22:58,367
I am doing that, you idiot!

972
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:58,369
&nbsp

973
00:22:58,379 --> 00:22:59,955
Okay, what does that mean?

974
00:22:59,965 --> 00:22:59,980
&nbsp

975
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:02,213
For who? Who are you talking about?

976
00:23:02,223 --> 00:23:03,341
&nbsp

977
00:23:03,351 --> 00:23:05,007
I used to have a partner.

978
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:05,009
&nbsp

979
00:23:05,019 --> 00:23:07,292
Like, a "partner" or...

980
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:07,317
&nbsp

981
00:23:07,327 --> 00:23:09,291
like a partner?

982
00:23:09,301 --> 00:23:09,947
&nbsp

983
00:23:09,957 --> 00:23:11,362
Both.

984
00:23:11,372 --> 00:23:11,849
&nbsp

985
00:23:11,859 --> 00:23:14,143
It was a long time ago, Cisco.

986
00:23:14,153 --> 00:23:14,685
&nbsp

987
00:23:14,695 --> 00:23:16,352
It's not like I'm burning
a candle for the guy,

988
00:23:16,362 --> 00:23:16,354
&nbsp

989
00:23:16,364 --> 00:23:19,135
but he did mean something to me.

990
00:23:19,145 --> 00:23:19,957
&nbsp

991
00:23:19,967 --> 00:23:22,892
It's been three years since
Abra Kadabra shot him dead.

992
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:24,128
&nbsp

993
00:23:24,138 --> 00:23:25,580
I'm sorry.

994
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:25,790
&nbsp

995
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,957
I have been searching
for him ever since,

996
00:23:27,967 --> 00:23:27,982
&nbsp

997
00:23:27,992 --> 00:23:30,916
and he finally showed back up.

998
00:23:30,926 --> 00:23:30,941
&nbsp

999
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,035
Ten minutes ago, I
had him dead to rights,

1000
00:23:33,045 --> 00:23:33,037
&nbsp

1001
00:23:33,047 --> 00:23:35,115
and then your friend messed it all up.

1002
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:35,178
&nbsp

1003
00:23:35,188 --> 00:23:36,777
So yes, I do know what it is like

1004
00:23:36,787 --> 00:23:36,779
&nbsp

1005
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:39,714
to care about someone so
much that you break the rules.

1006
00:23:39,724 --> 00:23:39,716
&nbsp

1007
00:23:39,726 --> 00:23:42,717
That's why I have to find
this guy, no matter what,

1008
00:23:42,727 --> 00:23:42,719
&nbsp

1009
00:23:42,729 --> 00:23:46,154
and when I do, he is
gonna pay for what he did.

1010
00:23:46,164 --> 00:23:47,724
&nbsp

1011
00:23:47,734 --> 00:23:49,740
No more delays.

1012
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:54,163
&nbsp

1013
00:23:54,173 --> 00:23:55,930
- Ready?
- Ready as I'll ever be.

1014
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:55,932
&nbsp

1015
00:23:55,942 --> 00:23:58,466
Okay, let's start with the
shrapnel on the surface.

1016
00:23:58,476 --> 00:23:58,468
&nbsp

1017
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:00,167
Okey-dokey.

1018
00:24:00,177 --> 00:24:00,169
&nbsp

1019
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:01,268
Just let me know if I do

1020
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:01,270
&nbsp

1021
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,473
any... thing wrong, okay?

1022
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:07,276
&nbsp

1023
00:24:07,286 --> 00:24:09,676
Okay, that's the first bit. Well done.

1024
00:24:09,686 --> 00:24:10,480
&nbsp

1025
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,912
Okay.

1026
00:24:11,922 --> 00:24:13,616
&nbsp

1027
00:24:13,626 --> 00:24:15,249
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1028
00:24:15,259 --> 00:24:15,251
&nbsp

1029
00:24:15,261 --> 00:24:16,621
Is there supposed to be this much blood?

1030
00:24:16,631 --> 00:24:16,646
&nbsp

1031
00:24:16,656 --> 00:24:18,853
It's normal for the shrapnel to cavitate

1032
00:24:18,863 --> 00:24:18,855
&nbsp

1033
00:24:18,865 --> 00:24:21,122
and displace tissue, but
if I lose too much blood,

1034
00:24:21,132 --> 00:24:21,124
&nbsp

1035
00:24:21,134 --> 00:24:22,256
I'll start hemorrhaging.

1036
00:24:22,266 --> 00:24:22,258
&nbsp

1037
00:24:22,268 --> 00:24:23,649
Okay.

1038
00:24:23,659 --> 00:24:23,960
&nbsp

1039
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:25,426
Oh, my God.

1040
00:24:25,436 --> 00:24:25,428
&nbsp

1041
00:24:25,438 --> 00:24:26,758
Okay.

1042
00:24:26,768 --> 00:24:27,524
&nbsp

1043
00:24:27,534 --> 00:24:29,830
All right, nearly done, nearly
done, hang in there, hang in there.

1044
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,221
&nbsp

1045
00:24:31,231 --> 00:24:32,867
Okay, well done. Well
done, that's all the pieces

1046
00:24:32,877 --> 00:24:32,869
&nbsp

1047
00:24:32,879 --> 00:24:34,535
of shrapnel from the surface gone.

1048
00:24:34,545 --> 00:24:34,537
&nbsp

1049
00:24:34,547 --> 00:24:36,241
Okay, great. Now it's
time for the hard one.

1050
00:24:36,251 --> 00:24:36,257
&nbsp

1051
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:37,457
But you're doing great.

1052
00:24:37,467 --> 00:24:37,459
&nbsp

1053
00:24:37,469 --> 00:24:39,258
- You got this, okay, Julian?
- Yes.

1054
00:24:39,268 --> 00:24:39,260
&nbsp

1055
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:43,319
It's wedged between my kidney
and my inferior vena cava,

1056
00:24:43,329 --> 00:24:43,344
&nbsp

1057
00:24:43,354 --> 00:24:46,725
and it's surrounded by
some major blood vessels.

1058
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:46,913
&nbsp

1059
00:24:46,923 --> 00:24:48,234
If you hit them, there's a good chance

1060
00:24:48,244 --> 00:24:48,236
&nbsp

1061
00:24:48,246 --> 00:24:50,370
- I'll go into shock.
- Shock?

1062
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:50,372
&nbsp

1063
00:24:50,382 --> 00:24:53,445
But it's okay. You've got this.

1064
00:24:53,455 --> 00:24:53,470
&nbsp

1065
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,203
Okay. All right.

1066
00:24:55,213 --> 00:24:56,811
&nbsp

1067
00:24:56,821 --> 00:24:57,877
Heart rate's increasing.

1068
00:24:57,887 --> 00:24:57,879
&nbsp

1069
00:24:57,889 --> 00:24:58,911
Okay, I think I've got it.

1070
00:24:58,921 --> 00:24:58,913
&nbsp

1071
00:24:58,923 --> 00:25:00,313
Great, pull it out.

1072
00:25:00,323 --> 00:25:00,315
&nbsp

1073
00:25:00,325 --> 00:25:01,748
I can't, Caitlin, it's stuck.

1074
00:25:01,758 --> 00:25:01,750
&nbsp

1075
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,716
Then turn it.

1076
00:25:03,726 --> 00:25:03,718
&nbsp

1077
00:25:03,728 --> 00:25:04,951
Guys, it's getting up there.

1078
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:04,953
&nbsp

1079
00:25:04,963 --> 00:25:06,185
It might be a tendon in the way.

1080
00:25:06,195 --> 00:25:06,187
&nbsp

1081
00:25:06,197 --> 00:25:07,320
If it's not a tendon...

1082
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:07,322
&nbsp

1083
00:25:07,332 --> 00:25:09,255
Then I will rip this necklace off.

1084
00:25:09,265 --> 00:25:09,257
&nbsp

1085
00:25:09,267 --> 00:25:11,897
No! I would rather die.

1086
00:25:11,907 --> 00:25:12,987
&nbsp

1087
00:25:12,997 --> 00:25:15,155
Caitlin, this is going to hurt.

1088
00:25:15,165 --> 00:25:19,709
&nbsp

1089
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:21,100
- Ahh.
- Ohh!

1090
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:23,171
&nbsp

1091
00:25:23,181 --> 00:25:24,437
Can you please stitch me up,

1092
00:25:24,447 --> 00:25:24,439
&nbsp

1093
00:25:24,449 --> 00:25:26,400
because I think I need to pass out?

1094
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:26,425
&nbsp

1095
00:25:26,435 --> 00:25:27,992
Yes, yes. Of course, of course.

1096
00:25:28,002 --> 00:25:28,017
&nbsp

1097
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:29,577
Well done, well done.

1098
00:25:29,587 --> 00:25:33,281
&nbsp

1099
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:34,981
She's gonna be all right.

1100
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:34,983
&nbsp

1101
00:25:34,993 --> 00:25:36,082
Thank God.

1102
00:25:36,092 --> 00:25:36,084
&nbsp

1103
00:25:36,094 --> 00:25:37,617
That really was amazing, Julian.

1104
00:25:37,627 --> 00:25:37,619
&nbsp

1105
00:25:37,629 --> 00:25:40,267
Seriously. Julian Albert, MD.

1106
00:25:40,277 --> 00:25:40,292
&nbsp

1107
00:25:40,302 --> 00:25:43,550
Hey, I think I know why Abra
Kadabra's been stealing all that tech.

1108
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:43,575
&nbsp

1109
00:25:43,585 --> 00:25:45,528
- Why?
- Build a time machine.

1110
00:25:45,538 --> 00:25:47,676
&nbsp

1111
00:25:47,686 --> 00:25:49,870
He's trying to get back to the future.

1112
00:25:49,880 --> 00:26:11,101
&nbsp

1113
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,687
Presto.

1114
00:26:12,697 --> 00:26:15,710
&nbsp

1115
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,305
What is that thing in his hands?

1116
00:26:17,315 --> 00:26:17,307
&nbsp

1117
00:26:17,317 --> 00:26:19,046
Everything Kadabra's been stealing,

1118
00:26:19,056 --> 00:26:19,071
&nbsp

1119
00:26:19,081 --> 00:26:21,887
these are the exact
components I used to build

1120
00:26:21,897 --> 00:26:21,912
&nbsp

1121
00:26:21,922 --> 00:26:23,484
Evil Wells's time sphere two years ago,

1122
00:26:23,494 --> 00:26:23,509
&nbsp

1123
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:25,743
but I could never figure out
what he used for a power source.

1124
00:26:25,753 --> 00:26:25,768
&nbsp

1125
00:26:25,778 --> 00:26:26,968
I think this is it.

1126
00:26:26,978 --> 00:26:26,993
&nbsp

1127
00:26:27,003 --> 00:26:28,350
So that's what he took
from the time vault,

1128
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:28,352
&nbsp

1129
00:26:28,362 --> 00:26:29,721
its power source?

1130
00:26:29,731 --> 00:26:29,746
&nbsp

1131
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:31,824
Last thing he needs to
return to the 64th century.

1132
00:26:31,834 --> 00:26:31,826
&nbsp

1133
00:26:31,836 --> 00:26:33,292
Well, we need to find his ass

1134
00:26:33,302 --> 00:26:33,294
&nbsp

1135
00:26:33,304 --> 00:26:35,261
before he pulls another
disappearing act.

1136
00:26:35,271 --> 00:26:35,263
&nbsp

1137
00:26:35,273 --> 00:26:37,363
If Kadabra's plan is
to "Marty McFly" himself

1138
00:26:37,373 --> 00:26:37,365
&nbsp

1139
00:26:37,375 --> 00:26:38,525
back to the future...

1140
00:26:38,535 --> 00:26:38,550
&nbsp

1141
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,566
He's gonna have to open
a temporal wormhole first,

1142
00:26:40,576 --> 00:26:40,568
&nbsp

1143
00:26:40,578 --> 00:26:41,968
- and when he does...
- We can nail him.

1144
00:26:41,978 --> 00:26:41,970
&nbsp

1145
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,002
Mm-hmm.

1146
00:26:43,012 --> 00:26:43,004
&nbsp

1147
00:26:43,014 --> 00:26:44,670
No, he's mine.

1148
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:44,672
&nbsp

1149
00:26:44,682 --> 00:26:46,205
I look forward to
showing him the same mercy

1150
00:26:46,215 --> 00:26:46,207
&nbsp

1151
00:26:46,217 --> 00:26:47,239
he showed my partner.

1152
00:26:47,249 --> 00:26:47,241
&nbsp

1153
00:26:47,251 --> 00:26:48,808
Hey, Gypsy.

1154
00:26:48,818 --> 00:26:48,810
&nbsp

1155
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,710
You can't go after him alone.

1156
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:50,712
&nbsp

1157
00:26:50,722 --> 00:26:52,002
Sure I can.

1158
00:26:52,012 --> 00:26:52,027
&nbsp

1159
00:26:52,037 --> 00:26:54,057
You want justice for all
those people that he's hurt,

1160
00:26:54,067 --> 00:26:54,082
&nbsp

1161
00:26:54,092 --> 00:26:55,715
for your partner, right?

1162
00:26:55,725 --> 00:26:55,717
&nbsp

1163
00:26:55,727 --> 00:26:57,917
Right now we're trying
to prevent someone we love

1164
00:26:57,927 --> 00:26:57,919
&nbsp

1165
00:26:57,929 --> 00:27:00,252
from getting hurt, but we
can't do that without your help.

1166
00:27:00,262 --> 00:27:00,254
&nbsp

1167
00:27:00,264 --> 00:27:02,054
I don't trust you guys anymore.

1168
00:27:02,064 --> 00:27:02,056
&nbsp

1169
00:27:02,066 --> 00:27:03,723
Kadabra's already given
both of us the slip.

1170
00:27:03,733 --> 00:27:03,725
&nbsp

1171
00:27:03,735 --> 00:27:05,191
He does it again through time,

1172
00:27:05,201 --> 00:27:05,193
&nbsp

1173
00:27:05,203 --> 00:27:07,522
I don't think we get
this opportunity back.

1174
00:27:07,532 --> 00:27:07,729
&nbsp

1175
00:27:07,739 --> 00:27:09,929
Only way we catch him is together.

1176
00:27:09,939 --> 00:27:27,832
&nbsp

1177
00:27:27,842 --> 00:27:29,866
Guys, Abra Kadabra's
heading south on Ninth.

1178
00:27:29,876 --> 00:27:29,891
&nbsp

1179
00:27:29,901 --> 00:27:31,370
He opened up a wormhole.

1180
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:31,512
&nbsp

1181
00:27:31,522 --> 00:27:32,855
What do you say?

1182
00:27:32,865 --> 00:27:39,628
&nbsp

1183
00:27:39,638 --> 00:27:41,229
We can't let him get past us.

1184
00:27:41,239 --> 00:27:41,254
&nbsp

1185
00:27:41,264 --> 00:27:42,553
We're not gonna do that.

1186
00:27:42,563 --> 00:27:42,578
&nbsp

1187
00:27:42,588 --> 00:27:44,244
Catch me if you can.

1188
00:27:44,254 --> 00:27:48,758
&nbsp

1189
00:27:48,768 --> 00:27:49,991
Where's he at?

1190
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:50,016
&nbsp

1191
00:27:50,026 --> 00:27:51,916
He's on State and Main!

1192
00:27:51,926 --> 00:27:55,888
&nbsp

1193
00:27:55,898 --> 00:27:56,954
We're on it!

1194
00:27:56,964 --> 00:27:56,956
&nbsp

1195
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:59,724
You shall not pass!

1196
00:27:59,734 --> 00:28:08,735
&nbsp

1197
00:28:08,745 --> 00:28:10,468
Ah!

1198
00:28:10,478 --> 00:28:16,009
&nbsp

1199
00:28:16,019 --> 00:28:18,075
Okay, now he's on Thurlow and Eighth.

1200
00:28:18,085 --> 00:28:28,730
&nbsp

1201
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,830
- We're gonna lose him.
- No, we're not.

1202
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:30,886
&nbsp

1203
00:28:30,896 --> 00:28:33,219
He's on Seventh, and he's moving fast!

1204
00:28:33,229 --> 00:28:45,171
&nbsp

1205
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:46,941
You gotta stop this guy.

1206
00:28:46,951 --> 00:28:47,940
&nbsp

1207
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:49,907
Time to go home.

1208
00:28:49,917 --> 00:28:52,677
&nbsp

1209
00:28:52,687 --> 00:28:54,877
Bar, he opened up another wormhole!

1210
00:28:54,887 --> 00:29:16,104
&nbsp

1211
00:29:16,114 --> 00:29:18,651
Yes! He did it, he got him.

1212
00:29:18,661 --> 00:29:18,676
&nbsp

1213
00:29:18,686 --> 00:29:20,431
Thank God.

1214
00:29:20,441 --> 00:29:20,456
&nbsp

1215
00:29:20,466 --> 00:29:22,640
So much for your disappearing act.

1216
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:22,642
&nbsp

1217
00:29:22,652 --> 00:29:24,108
No!

1218
00:29:24,118 --> 00:29:30,116
&nbsp

1219
00:29:30,126 --> 00:29:32,116
By the laws of Earth-19,
I hereby collect you

1220
00:29:32,126 --> 00:29:32,118
&nbsp

1221
00:29:32,128 --> 00:29:34,653
for the crime of mass murder.

1222
00:29:34,663 --> 00:29:34,750
&nbsp

1223
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,483
Let her take me.

1224
00:29:36,493 --> 00:29:36,508
&nbsp

1225
00:29:36,518 --> 00:29:39,000
You'll never find out what I know.

1226
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:39,025
&nbsp

1227
00:29:39,035 --> 00:29:40,824
And Iris dies.

1228
00:29:40,834 --> 00:30:29,364
&nbsp

1229
00:30:29,374 --> 00:30:31,614
You've come to see me off.

1230
00:30:31,624 --> 00:30:32,303
&nbsp

1231
00:30:32,313 --> 00:30:34,364
I'm really touched.

1232
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:37,850
&nbsp

1233
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,616
What are we gonna do here?

1234
00:30:39,626 --> 00:30:42,009
&nbsp

1235
00:30:42,019 --> 00:30:44,009
You're going with her.

1236
00:30:44,019 --> 00:30:45,581
&nbsp

1237
00:30:45,591 --> 00:30:47,403
I'm not gonna stop her.

1238
00:30:47,413 --> 00:30:47,428
&nbsp

1239
00:30:47,438 --> 00:30:50,751
Then you'll never find
out what you want to know.

1240
00:30:50,761 --> 00:30:59,194
&nbsp

1241
00:30:59,204 --> 00:31:01,261
I have nothing to offer you.

1242
00:31:01,271 --> 00:31:01,263
&nbsp

1243
00:31:01,273 --> 00:31:03,033
No reprieve.

1244
00:31:03,043 --> 00:31:03,244
&nbsp

1245
00:31:03,254 --> 00:31:05,432
No escape for what you're facing.

1246
00:31:05,442 --> 00:31:05,434
&nbsp

1247
00:31:05,444 --> 00:31:07,845
You've done some terrible things.

1248
00:31:07,855 --> 00:31:09,104
&nbsp

1249
00:31:09,114 --> 00:31:10,892
But you are still a man.

1250
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:11,607
&nbsp

1251
00:31:11,617 --> 00:31:13,611
You have a family,

1252
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:13,976
&nbsp

1253
00:31:13,986 --> 00:31:16,829
friends, people that you care about.

1254
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:17,679
&nbsp

1255
00:31:17,689 --> 00:31:19,846
Somewhere inside of you there must be

1256
00:31:19,856 --> 00:31:19,848
&nbsp

1257
00:31:19,858 --> 00:31:23,088
a glimmer of light, of hope.

1258
00:31:23,098 --> 00:31:23,909
&nbsp

1259
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:26,956
It's that part of you that I'm asking.

1260
00:31:26,966 --> 00:31:28,402
&nbsp

1261
00:31:28,412 --> 00:31:29,838
I'm begging.

1262
00:31:29,848 --> 00:31:31,755
&nbsp

1263
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:33,635
Help me save her.

1264
00:31:33,645 --> 00:31:35,838
&nbsp

1265
00:31:35,848 --> 00:31:37,432
Flash.

1266
00:31:37,442 --> 00:31:38,600
&nbsp

1267
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:39,768
Begging.

1268
00:31:39,778 --> 00:31:42,604
&nbsp

1269
00:31:42,614 --> 00:31:44,938
See, here it is.

1270
00:31:44,948 --> 00:31:44,940
&nbsp

1271
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:48,975
In the future, you and I
have been enemies for years.

1272
00:31:48,985 --> 00:31:48,977
&nbsp

1273
00:31:48,987 --> 00:31:51,049
Oh, there have been others, of course.

1274
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:51,074
&nbsp

1275
00:31:51,084 --> 00:31:54,909
There was Thawne, Zoom, DeVoe,

1276
00:31:54,919 --> 00:31:55,117
&nbsp

1277
00:31:55,127 --> 00:31:58,414
but none of them hurt you like Savitar.

1278
00:31:58,424 --> 00:31:58,439
&nbsp

1279
00:31:58,449 --> 00:32:01,565
He truly broke you.

1280
00:32:01,575 --> 00:32:02,157
&nbsp

1281
00:32:02,167 --> 00:32:03,860
I have to be honest.

1282
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:03,885
&nbsp

1283
00:32:03,895 --> 00:32:06,252
I was always a little bit jealous.

1284
00:32:06,262 --> 00:32:06,428
&nbsp

1285
00:32:06,438 --> 00:32:10,766
But now, it's like I
get to kill her too.

1286
00:32:10,776 --> 00:32:16,305
&nbsp

1287
00:32:16,315 --> 00:32:20,572
If you'll excuse me, I
have my execution to attend.

1288
00:32:20,582 --> 00:32:35,124
&nbsp

1289
00:32:35,134 --> 00:32:37,311
Where does this leave us?

1290
00:32:37,321 --> 00:32:38,994
&nbsp

1291
00:32:39,004 --> 00:32:40,303
I don't know.

1292
00:32:40,313 --> 00:32:40,562
&nbsp

1293
00:32:40,572 --> 00:32:41,904
Cisco, I...

1294
00:32:41,914 --> 00:33:20,636
&nbsp

1295
00:33:20,646 --> 00:33:22,501
Hey.

1296
00:33:22,511 --> 00:33:23,338
&nbsp

1297
00:33:23,348 --> 00:33:25,009
I'm still here.

1298
00:33:25,019 --> 00:33:25,374
&nbsp

1299
00:33:25,384 --> 00:33:27,040
Yeah.

1300
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:27,309
&nbsp

1301
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:29,709
Wasn't gonna let you go that easy.

1302
00:33:29,719 --> 00:33:29,711
&nbsp

1303
00:33:29,721 --> 00:33:31,118
Kadabra?

1304
00:33:31,128 --> 00:33:31,413
&nbsp

1305
00:33:31,423 --> 00:33:32,812
He's gone.

1306
00:33:32,822 --> 00:33:32,814
&nbsp

1307
00:33:32,824 --> 00:33:35,048
He's gone for good, apparently.

1308
00:33:35,058 --> 00:33:36,318
&nbsp

1309
00:33:36,328 --> 00:33:38,173
Sorry.

1310
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:38,198
&nbsp

1311
00:33:38,208 --> 00:33:40,126
My palm's are sweaty.

1312
00:33:40,136 --> 00:33:40,322
&nbsp

1313
00:33:40,332 --> 00:33:42,103
It's quite all right.

1314
00:33:42,113 --> 00:33:43,058
&nbsp

1315
00:33:43,068 --> 00:33:44,524
Honestly, my stitch work may leave

1316
00:33:44,534 --> 00:33:44,526
&nbsp

1317
00:33:44,536 --> 00:33:46,899
quite a lot to be desired, so.

1318
00:33:46,909 --> 00:33:47,429
&nbsp

1319
00:33:47,439 --> 00:33:48,860
It's okay.

1320
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:49,364
&nbsp

1321
00:33:49,374 --> 00:33:51,531
I was never much of a
two-piece bathing suit

1322
00:33:51,541 --> 00:33:51,533
&nbsp

1323
00:33:51,543 --> 00:33:53,099
kind of gal anyway.

1324
00:33:53,109 --> 00:33:55,604
&nbsp

1325
00:33:55,614 --> 00:33:58,192
I cannot believe what you did, Caitlin.

1326
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:58,217
&nbsp

1327
00:33:58,227 --> 00:34:00,962
I mean, staying awake
during your own surgery,

1328
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:00,987
&nbsp

1329
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:03,520
that's one thing, but
talking my clumsy hands

1330
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:03,545
&nbsp

1331
00:34:03,555 --> 00:34:05,603
through it, that's quite the other.

1332
00:34:05,613 --> 00:34:05,760
&nbsp

1333
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:08,027
You are immensely brave.

1334
00:34:08,037 --> 00:34:08,052
&nbsp

1335
00:34:08,062 --> 00:34:09,883
You fought through the pain

1336
00:34:09,893 --> 00:34:09,885
&nbsp

1337
00:34:09,895 --> 00:34:12,152
like I've never seen anyone before.

1338
00:34:12,162 --> 00:34:12,154
&nbsp

1339
00:34:12,164 --> 00:34:13,987
You did all the hard work.

1340
00:34:13,997 --> 00:34:15,394
&nbsp

1341
00:34:15,404 --> 00:34:17,189
Hardly.

1342
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:17,627
&nbsp

1343
00:34:17,637 --> 00:34:20,079
You going soft on me, Julian?

1344
00:34:20,089 --> 00:34:21,230
&nbsp

1345
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,503
Yes.

1346
00:34:22,513 --> 00:34:23,932
&nbsp

1347
00:34:23,942 --> 00:34:25,636
Absolutely.

1348
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:33,720
&nbsp

1349
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:35,813
I'm so terribly sorry.

1350
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:36,745
&nbsp

1351
00:34:36,755 --> 00:34:38,545
That's most clumsy of me.

1352
00:34:38,555 --> 00:34:38,547
&nbsp

1353
00:34:38,557 --> 00:34:41,223
Some bedside manner you got there.

1354
00:34:41,233 --> 00:34:42,113
&nbsp

1355
00:34:42,123 --> 00:34:43,617
I'm working on it.

1356
00:34:43,627 --> 00:34:46,501
&nbsp

1357
00:34:46,511 --> 00:34:47,941
Just rest.

1358
00:34:47,951 --> 00:34:56,431
&nbsp

1359
00:34:56,441 --> 00:34:58,031
Here you go.

1360
00:34:58,041 --> 00:34:58,033
&nbsp

1361
00:34:58,043 --> 00:34:59,671
Thank you.

1362
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:03,338
&nbsp

1363
00:35:03,348 --> 00:35:04,727
Easy.

1364
00:35:04,737 --> 00:35:06,108
&nbsp

1365
00:35:06,118 --> 00:35:07,328
Sorry.

1366
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:09,478
&nbsp

1367
00:35:09,488 --> 00:35:11,430
I should've been stronger.

1368
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:11,836
&nbsp

1369
00:35:11,846 --> 00:35:14,352
You think you should've shot Kadabra?

1370
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:14,616
&nbsp

1371
00:35:14,626 --> 00:35:18,418
Dad, I think you showed true
strength by letting him go.

1372
00:35:18,428 --> 00:35:18,420
&nbsp

1373
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:20,620
I try to be strong for you guys,

1374
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:20,622
&nbsp

1375
00:35:20,632 --> 00:35:23,390
for you and Wally and Barry.

1376
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:23,392
&nbsp

1377
00:35:23,402 --> 00:35:25,525
Dad, you have been,

1378
00:35:25,535 --> 00:35:25,527
&nbsp

1379
00:35:25,537 --> 00:35:27,827
and it makes me stronger too.

1380
00:35:27,837 --> 00:35:29,097
&nbsp

1381
00:35:29,107 --> 00:35:31,359
When you were a baby, I was...

1382
00:35:31,369 --> 00:35:31,767
&nbsp

1383
00:35:31,777 --> 00:35:34,078
I was terrified

1384
00:35:34,088 --> 00:35:34,103
&nbsp

1385
00:35:34,113 --> 00:35:36,703
that you might die in
the middle of the night.

1386
00:35:36,713 --> 00:35:36,905
&nbsp

1387
00:35:36,915 --> 00:35:38,859
I just didn't sleep.

1388
00:35:38,869 --> 00:35:39,686
&nbsp

1389
00:35:39,696 --> 00:35:41,250
I would just...

1390
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,156
&nbsp

1391
00:35:42,166 --> 00:35:44,156
sit in your room...

1392
00:35:44,166 --> 00:35:45,169
&nbsp

1393
00:35:45,179 --> 00:35:46,828
and watch you sleep.

1394
00:35:46,838 --> 00:35:47,693
&nbsp

1395
00:35:47,703 --> 00:35:50,460
I put my hand on your chest,

1396
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:50,485
&nbsp

1397
00:35:50,495 --> 00:35:52,030
just to make sure you were breathing,

1398
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:52,055
&nbsp

1399
00:35:52,065 --> 00:35:53,854
and then I...

1400
00:35:53,864 --> 00:35:54,122
&nbsp

1401
00:35:54,132 --> 00:35:57,553
I would just sit there
there, praying that...

1402
00:35:57,563 --> 00:36:00,862
&nbsp

1403
00:36:00,872 --> 00:36:03,207
you'd just keep breathing.

1404
00:36:03,217 --> 00:36:04,499
&nbsp

1405
00:36:04,509 --> 00:36:06,545
That's how I feel right now.

1406
00:36:06,555 --> 00:36:11,684
&nbsp

1407
00:36:11,694 --> 00:36:14,685
I don't know what I can do to save you.

1408
00:36:14,695 --> 00:36:20,021
&nbsp

1409
00:36:20,031 --> 00:36:21,856
I know how to save her.

1410
00:36:21,866 --> 00:36:23,097
&nbsp

1411
00:36:23,107 --> 00:36:24,496
What?

1412
00:36:24,506 --> 00:36:24,521
&nbsp

1413
00:36:24,531 --> 00:36:26,317
I know how to save her.

1414
00:36:26,327 --> 00:36:27,255
&nbsp

1415
00:36:27,265 --> 00:36:30,528
Kadabra, Savitar, Thawne.

1416
00:36:30,538 --> 00:36:30,926
&nbsp

1417
00:36:30,936 --> 00:36:35,614
You know, they're always
one step ahead of us...

1418
00:36:35,624 --> 00:36:35,639
&nbsp

1419
00:36:35,649 --> 00:36:37,197
for one reason...

1420
00:36:37,207 --> 00:36:37,199
&nbsp

1421
00:36:37,209 --> 00:36:38,665
they know what's gonna happen.

1422
00:36:38,675 --> 00:36:39,772
&nbsp

1423
00:36:39,782 --> 00:36:42,335
So every move we make,
every trap we try and set,

1424
00:36:42,345 --> 00:36:42,337
&nbsp

1425
00:36:42,347 --> 00:36:43,870
it's all just history to them.

1426
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:43,996
&nbsp

1427
00:36:44,006 --> 00:36:46,025
They're armed with the future.

1428
00:36:46,035 --> 00:36:46,152
&nbsp

1429
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,682
Well, not anymore.

1430
00:36:47,692 --> 00:36:47,909
&nbsp

1431
00:36:47,919 --> 00:36:49,674
What does that mean?

1432
00:36:49,684 --> 00:36:50,746
&nbsp

1433
00:36:50,756 --> 00:36:53,565
If the answers that we need
to stop Savitar and save you

1434
00:36:53,575 --> 00:36:53,590
&nbsp

1435
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,916
are in the future, then
that's where I need to go.

1436
00:36:56,926 --> 00:36:56,918
&nbsp

1437
00:36:56,928 --> 00:36:58,818
I'm gonna run to the future.

1438
00:36:58,828 --> 00:37:08,340
&nbsp

1439
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:10,422
- Mmm.
- No more strawberry.

1440
00:37:10,432 --> 00:37:10,424
&nbsp

1441
00:37:10,434 --> 00:37:11,657
What do you mean, there's
no more strawberry?

1442
00:37:11,667 --> 00:37:11,659
&nbsp

1443
00:37:11,669 --> 00:37:13,345
I just bought some, like, a week ago.

1444
00:37:13,355 --> 00:37:13,370
&nbsp

1445
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,861
Yeah, well, I may have eaten some,

1446
00:37:15,871 --> 00:37:15,863
&nbsp

1447
00:37:15,873 --> 00:37:17,563
slash... all.

1448
00:37:17,573 --> 00:37:17,565
&nbsp

1449
00:37:17,575 --> 00:37:19,298
- Cisco.
- Do you want me to go out

1450
00:37:19,308 --> 00:37:19,300
&nbsp

1451
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:20,432
and get you more strawberry Jell-O?

1452
00:37:20,442 --> 00:37:20,434
&nbsp

1453
00:37:20,444 --> 00:37:21,567
I will get you more.

1454
00:37:21,577 --> 00:37:21,592
&nbsp

1455
00:37:21,602 --> 00:37:22,776
No, it's fine,

1456
00:37:22,786 --> 00:37:22,801
&nbsp

1457
00:37:22,811 --> 00:37:25,103
but next time I operate on you,
you're getting bupkes, mister.

1458
00:37:25,113 --> 00:37:25,105
&nbsp

1459
00:37:25,115 --> 00:37:27,539
Mm, next time you operate on me,

1460
00:37:27,549 --> 00:37:27,564
&nbsp

1461
00:37:27,574 --> 00:37:29,321
maybe you can...

1462
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:29,346
&nbsp

1463
00:37:29,356 --> 00:37:30,952
fix my broken heart.

1464
00:37:30,962 --> 00:37:30,977
&nbsp

1465
00:37:30,987 --> 00:37:33,322
I'm sorry it didn't work
out with you and Gypsy.

1466
00:37:33,332 --> 00:37:33,347
&nbsp

1467
00:37:33,357 --> 00:37:36,114
If two metas from
two different universes

1468
00:37:36,124 --> 00:37:36,116
&nbsp

1469
00:37:36,126 --> 00:37:38,517
with the same vibrational powers

1470
00:37:38,527 --> 00:37:38,519
&nbsp

1471
00:37:38,529 --> 00:37:40,141
can't make it work, then...

1472
00:37:40,151 --> 00:37:40,166
&nbsp

1473
00:37:40,176 --> 00:37:41,741
what hope is there?

1474
00:37:41,751 --> 00:37:41,766
&nbsp

1475
00:37:41,776 --> 00:37:42,821
There you guys are.

1476
00:37:42,831 --> 00:37:42,823
&nbsp

1477
00:37:42,833 --> 00:37:44,022
I've been looking all over for...

1478
00:37:44,032 --> 00:37:44,024
&nbsp

1479
00:37:44,034 --> 00:37:45,490
what are you doing in bed?

1480
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:45,492
&nbsp

1481
00:37:45,502 --> 00:37:48,055
- It's a long story, H.R.
- I have a long story.

1482
00:37:48,065 --> 00:37:48,080
&nbsp

1483
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:49,586
Yeah, how about you tell
us where you've been?

1484
00:37:49,596 --> 00:37:49,611
&nbsp

1485
00:37:49,621 --> 00:37:51,717
Her name is Rhonda, and
she's into new positions.

1486
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:51,742
&nbsp

1487
00:37:51,752 --> 00:37:53,765
- We had the...
- Okay. Oh, my God.

1488
00:37:53,775 --> 00:37:53,767
&nbsp

1489
00:37:53,777 --> 00:37:56,268
Stop talking. You
gotta let somebody know

1490
00:37:56,278 --> 00:37:56,270
&nbsp

1491
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,470
next time you decide to
go on a two-day love romp.

1492
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:58,495
&nbsp

1493
00:37:58,505 --> 00:38:01,133
Who was worried about me?

1494
00:38:01,143 --> 00:38:01,344
&nbsp

1495
00:38:01,354 --> 00:38:03,208
He was. I'm touched.

1496
00:38:03,218 --> 00:38:03,210
&nbsp

1497
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,978
You'll be touched in
the face with a hammer

1498
00:38:05,988 --> 00:38:05,980
&nbsp

1499
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:07,393
the next time you pull
something like that.

1500
00:38:07,403 --> 00:38:07,418
&nbsp

1501
00:38:07,428 --> 00:38:08,504
Guys, stop it.

1502
00:38:08,514 --> 00:38:08,529
&nbsp

1503
00:38:08,539 --> 00:38:09,715
Don't make me laugh, or
I'll bust my stitches.

1504
00:38:09,725 --> 00:38:10,951
&nbsp

1505
00:38:10,961 --> 00:38:12,818
Is that lime Jell-O?

1506
00:38:12,828 --> 00:38:12,820
&nbsp

1507
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:14,453
It's all you, H.R.

1508
00:38:14,463 --> 00:38:14,478
&nbsp

1509
00:38:14,488 --> 00:38:16,065
Are you serious?

1510
00:38:16,075 --> 00:38:16,090
&nbsp

1511
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,123
Ah, ha ha ha ha!

1512
00:38:18,133 --> 00:38:18,125
&nbsp

1513
00:38:18,135 --> 00:38:21,520
I... love the lime.

1514
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:22,763
&nbsp

1515
00:38:22,773 --> 00:38:24,582
I love the lime!

1516
00:38:24,592 --> 00:38:24,965
&nbsp

1517
00:38:24,975 --> 00:38:27,645
You were really worried
about him, weren't you?

1518
00:38:27,655 --> 00:38:27,935
&nbsp

1519
00:38:27,945 --> 00:38:31,690
Just promise me that
you'll never ever tell him.

1520
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,007
&nbsp

1521
00:38:33,017 --> 00:38:35,674
Cross my heart and hope to...

1522
00:38:35,684 --> 00:38:38,212
&nbsp

1523
00:38:38,222 --> 00:38:39,954
Caitlin?

1524
00:38:39,964 --> 00:38:39,979
&nbsp

1525
00:38:39,989 --> 00:38:41,046
Hey!

1526
00:38:41,056 --> 00:38:42,272
&nbsp

1527
00:38:42,282 --> 00:38:44,372
Caitlin? Caitlin? Somebody help!

1528
00:38:44,382 --> 00:38:44,397
&nbsp

1529
00:38:44,407 --> 00:38:46,228
W-w-what happened? What happened?

1530
00:38:46,238 --> 00:38:46,253
&nbsp

1531
00:38:46,263 --> 00:38:47,586
I don't know, she just started seizing.

1532
00:38:47,596 --> 00:38:47,588
&nbsp

1533
00:38:47,598 --> 00:38:48,920
Hold her down, hold her down.

1534
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:48,922
&nbsp

1535
00:38:48,932 --> 00:38:50,789
Hey, H.R., grab her legs. Hold her down!

1536
00:38:50,799 --> 00:38:51,152
&nbsp

1537
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,557
What... what's happening?

1538
00:38:52,567 --> 00:38:55,696
&nbsp

1539
00:38:55,706 --> 00:38:56,794
She's not breathing.

1540
00:38:56,804 --> 00:38:56,819
&nbsp

1541
00:38:56,829 --> 00:38:58,357
We have to get an
ambulance in here right now.

1542
00:38:58,367 --> 00:38:58,382
&nbsp

1543
00:38:58,392 --> 00:38:59,498
H.R., grab the crash cart.

1544
00:38:59,508 --> 00:38:59,500
&nbsp

1545
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:01,129
Cisco, grab the oxygen.

1546
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:01,435
&nbsp

1547
00:39:01,445 --> 00:39:03,028
Wheel it over here!

1548
00:39:03,038 --> 00:39:04,008
&nbsp

1549
00:39:04,018 --> 00:39:05,641
Slow and steady, over her mouth.

1550
00:39:05,651 --> 00:39:05,666
&nbsp

1551
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,105
Okay, good.

1552
00:39:07,115 --> 00:39:07,107
&nbsp

1553
00:39:07,117 --> 00:39:08,540
Come on, slow and steady, that's it.

1554
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:08,542
&nbsp

1555
00:39:08,552 --> 00:39:10,309
- That's it.
- What's happening?

1556
00:39:10,319 --> 00:39:10,311
&nbsp

1557
00:39:10,321 --> 00:39:11,810
She may have threw a
blood clot, I don't know.

1558
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:11,812
&nbsp

1559
00:39:11,822 --> 00:39:13,111
- Julian!
- Charge the paddles!

1560
00:39:13,121 --> 00:39:13,113
&nbsp

1561
00:39:13,123 --> 00:39:14,310
- Okay...
- Give me the paddles!

1562
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:14,335
&nbsp

1563
00:39:14,345 --> 00:39:15,614
- Charging, you're good.
- Okay, give me the...

1564
00:39:15,624 --> 00:39:15,616
&nbsp

1565
00:39:15,626 --> 00:39:17,149
Give it here. Clear.

1566
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:22,389
&nbsp

1567
00:39:22,399 --> 00:39:23,789
All the way, turn it up to the top!

1568
00:39:23,799 --> 00:39:23,791
&nbsp

1569
00:39:23,801 --> 00:39:25,490
- All the way up!
- Okay, you're ready.

1570
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:25,492
&nbsp

1571
00:39:25,502 --> 00:39:27,225
- Clear.
- Clear, clear, clear.

1572
00:39:27,235 --> 00:39:28,629
&nbsp

1573
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:30,228
Char... go.

1574
00:39:30,238 --> 00:39:33,178
&nbsp

1575
00:39:33,188 --> 00:39:34,333
Keep going.

1576
00:39:34,343 --> 00:39:34,335
&nbsp

1577
00:39:34,345 --> 00:39:36,435
Come on, Caitlin, come on!

1578
00:39:36,445 --> 00:39:37,671
&nbsp

1579
00:39:37,681 --> 00:39:39,104
Keep going, just keep going.

1580
00:39:39,114 --> 00:39:39,106
&nbsp

1581
00:39:39,116 --> 00:39:41,053
Uh, here, take this.

1582
00:39:41,063 --> 00:39:41,078
&nbsp

1583
00:39:41,088 --> 00:39:42,875
Here we go, she's coming back.

1584
00:39:42,885 --> 00:39:42,876
&nbsp

1585
00:39:42,886 --> 00:39:44,676
She's coming back.

1586
00:39:44,686 --> 00:39:44,701
&nbsp

1587
00:39:44,711 --> 00:39:45,944
Yes, she is.

1588
00:39:45,954 --> 00:39:47,527
&nbsp

1589
00:39:47,537 --> 00:39:49,848
Come on. Here she comes.

1590
00:39:49,858 --> 00:39:49,850
&nbsp

1591
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:52,756
Come on! Don't stop.

1592
00:39:52,766 --> 00:39:53,320
&nbsp

1593
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:54,865
Please.

1594
00:39:54,875 --> 00:39:56,256
&nbsp

1595
00:39:56,266 --> 00:39:58,156
Please don't stop.

1596
00:39:58,166 --> 00:40:18,566
&nbsp

1597
00:40:18,576 --> 00:40:20,011
She's gone.

1598
00:40:20,021 --> 00:40:28,856
&nbsp

1599
00:40:28,866 --> 00:40:30,088
Stop! That's not what she wanted!

1600
00:40:30,098 --> 00:40:30,090
&nbsp

1601
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,656
I don't care!

1602
00:40:31,666 --> 00:40:31,658
&nbsp

1603
00:40:31,668 --> 00:40:34,291
I'm not gonna sit here
and watch her die, okay?

1604
00:40:34,301 --> 00:40:36,346
&nbsp

1605
00:40:36,356 --> 00:40:37,863
Okay?

1606
00:40:37,873 --> 00:40:37,865
&nbsp

1607
00:40:37,875 --> 00:40:40,197
It's all right, mate, it's okay.

1608
00:40:40,207 --> 00:40:40,359
&nbsp

1609
00:40:40,369 --> 00:40:42,268
It's okay.

1610
00:40:42,278 --> 00:40:50,580
&nbsp

1611
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:51,977
Caitlin?

1612
00:40:51,987 --> 00:41:00,238
&nbsp

1613
00:41:00,248 --> 00:41:02,071
Huh.

1614
00:41:02,081 --> 00:41:17,171
&nbsp

1615
00:41:17,181 --> 00:41:18,470
Caitlin.
