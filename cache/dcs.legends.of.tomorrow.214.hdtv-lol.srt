1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:04,724
Seriously, you idiots haven't
figured this out by now?

2
00:00:04,726 --> 00:00:06,924
It all started when we
blew up the time pigs,

3
00:00:06,926 --> 00:00:08,504
the Time Masters.

4
00:00:08,506 --> 00:00:10,196
Now, history is all screwed up.

5
00:00:10,198 --> 00:00:12,415
But it's up to us to unscrew it up.

6
00:00:12,417 --> 00:00:15,652
But half the time, we
screw things up even worse.

7
00:00:15,654 --> 00:00:18,572
So don't call us heroes.
We're something else.

8
00:00:18,574 --> 00:00:20,857
We're Legends.

9
00:00:20,859 --> 00:00:23,026
Previously, on "Legends of Tomorrow"...

10
00:00:23,028 --> 00:00:24,694
You're my grandfather.
You are more than that.

11
00:00:24,696 --> 00:00:26,863
- You're a hero to me.
- My quarters. Tonight.

12
00:00:26,865 --> 00:00:28,532
I'll give you something
else to think about.

13
00:00:28,534 --> 00:00:30,864
- You can't date Amaya.
- She has a destiny.

14
00:00:30,866 --> 00:00:32,245
And so do her descendents.

15
00:00:32,247 --> 00:00:35,462
Have either of you gentlemen
heard of the Spear of Destiny?

16
00:00:35,464 --> 00:00:37,323
The Spear can alter reality itself.

17
00:00:37,325 --> 00:00:40,087
- Who's coming for you?
- It's not a who, it's a what.

18
00:00:40,089 --> 00:00:42,462
- And it's trying to kill me.
- He has to keep moving

19
00:00:42,464 --> 00:00:45,348
in order for his own non-existence
not to catch up to him.

20
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,467
Captain Hunter is the
only one who can tell us

21
00:00:47,469 --> 00:00:49,636
where Commander Steel and the
final piece of the Spear is.

22
00:00:50,806 --> 00:00:53,023
- Where am I?
- You're home.

23
00:00:53,025 --> 00:00:55,141
So, I've been told you were bumped up

24
00:00:55,143 --> 00:00:58,311
to the prime crew for "Apollo 13."

25
00:00:58,313 --> 00:00:59,863
Yeah, man.

26
00:00:59,865 --> 00:01:01,481
We'll see about that.

27
00:01:03,036 --> 00:01:04,914
_

28
00:01:05,821 --> 00:01:09,372
Welcome to Manhattan, 1965.

29
00:01:09,374 --> 00:01:12,158
I have been dropped off behind enemy lines

30
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,628
and cities all over the world.

31
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,963
Never been dropped off in the future.

32
00:01:16,965 --> 00:01:19,549
Now you have to disappear,
start a whole new life.

33
00:01:19,551 --> 00:01:21,551
The Spear of Destiny must
be protected at all costs.

34
00:01:21,553 --> 00:01:23,253
Roger that, sir.

35
00:01:23,255 --> 00:01:26,089
I know this mission won't
be easy, Commander Heywood.

36
00:01:26,091 --> 00:01:28,558
For me or for Bettie?

37
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,176
She'll think I died in Leipzig.

38
00:01:30,178 --> 00:01:33,263
Little Hank is barely a month old.

39
00:01:33,265 --> 00:01:35,398
Your family's sacrifice

40
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,817
might just save the world.

41
00:01:43,609 --> 00:01:45,909
Give those to my wife and son.

42
00:01:49,114 --> 00:01:51,114
Godspeed, Henry.

43
00:02:05,097 --> 00:02:06,880
- I don't see him.
- That is odd.

44
00:02:06,882 --> 00:02:10,100
I dropped him off right here a moment ago.

45
00:02:10,102 --> 00:02:11,885
Where could he have gone?

46
00:02:11,887 --> 00:02:13,770
Henry!

47
00:02:16,274 --> 00:02:18,692
Oh, I'm sorry. My mistake.

48
00:02:18,694 --> 00:02:19,943
Where is he?

49
00:02:19,945 --> 00:02:21,728
We used to call Henry "the Chameleon."

50
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:23,947
He speaks seven languages
like a local and he's a master

51
00:02:23,949 --> 00:02:25,782
in the art of camouflage and concealment.

52
00:02:25,784 --> 00:02:28,818
If you told him to disappear,
that's exactly what he did.

53
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:32,038
Don't worry, if it's hard for
us to find your grandfather,

54
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,824
it's hard for the Legion.

55
00:02:36,828 --> 00:02:38,912
1965 was a bust.

56
00:02:38,914 --> 00:02:40,714
Oh, sorry, buddy.

57
00:02:40,716 --> 00:02:42,749
It's all right, Rip said he
dropped my Grandfather off

58
00:02:42,751 --> 00:02:45,969
in 1965 New York and told
him to assume a new identity.

59
00:02:45,971 --> 00:02:47,303
Well, he'd need to find work.

60
00:02:47,305 --> 00:02:48,588
Why?

61
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,090
Henry was a military man.

62
00:02:50,092 --> 00:02:51,758
He wouldn't have become an accountant.

63
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,727
He would have wanted a job
that still offered adventure,

64
00:02:53,729 --> 00:02:55,512
and yet was still somehow patriotic.

65
00:02:55,514 --> 00:02:57,180
FBI? CIA?

66
00:02:57,182 --> 00:02:59,733
He was a fighter pilot before
he was recruited by the JSA.

67
00:02:59,735 --> 00:03:01,651
In the sixties, the
fledgling National Aeronautics

68
00:03:01,653 --> 00:03:03,436
and Space Administration used to call upon

69
00:03:03,438 --> 00:03:05,772
test pilots to apply to be astronauts.

70
00:03:05,774 --> 00:03:08,575
Exactly, what could be more
patriotic, more adventurous

71
00:03:08,577 --> 00:03:09,909
than exploring space?

72
00:03:09,911 --> 00:03:11,778
Nice, Gideon, pull up anything you can.

73
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:15,281
Press clippings, newspaper
articles, re: NASA circa 1965.

74
00:03:15,283 --> 00:03:16,916
Certainly, Captain.

75
00:03:16,918 --> 00:03:19,002
Okay, okay, okay.

76
00:03:19,004 --> 00:03:21,171
Come on, come on.

77
00:03:21,173 --> 00:03:22,539
Wait, wait, stop, stop.

78
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,340
Right there.

79
00:03:24,342 --> 00:03:26,176
I'd recognize that
Heywood jawline anywhere.

80
00:03:26,178 --> 00:03:27,877
April 13th, 1970.

81
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:29,629
"Mission Control works
to save 'Apollo 13.'"

82
00:03:29,631 --> 00:03:32,682
Come on, could your
grandfather get any cooler?

83
00:03:32,684 --> 00:03:35,268
I think I may have found a
way to track Commander Heywood.

84
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,302
Don't worry, Mr. Hunter.

85
00:03:36,304 --> 00:03:38,221
We've already found him.

86
00:03:38,223 --> 00:03:40,440
- You did?
- We're headed to Houston, 1970.

87
00:03:40,442 --> 00:03:43,226
Elvis at the Astrodome.

88
00:03:43,228 --> 00:03:44,444
And then we're going to
rescue my grandfather.

89
00:03:44,446 --> 00:03:45,645
Then Elvis.

90
00:03:45,647 --> 00:03:47,447
We still need to figure out a way

91
00:03:47,449 --> 00:03:50,366
of contacting Commander Heywood
without arousing suspicion.

92
00:03:50,368 --> 00:03:52,235
To that end, I suggest that we...

93
00:03:52,237 --> 00:03:54,154
It's simple.

94
00:03:54,156 --> 00:03:55,155
We infiltrate NASA.

95
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:03,281

_

97
00:04:07,335 --> 00:04:11,221
Today, NASA Flight Controllers
are monitoring "Apollo 13,"

98
00:04:11,223 --> 00:04:13,923
NASA'S seventh manned mission to the Moon.

99
00:04:13,925 --> 00:04:16,259
We need to figure out a way
to get into Mission Control.

100
00:04:16,261 --> 00:04:18,011
I don't think that's included in the tour.

101
00:04:18,013 --> 00:04:20,063
Commander Heywood is
not at Mission Control.

102
00:04:20,065 --> 00:04:21,397
How do you know that?

103
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:24,067
Because I'm looking right at him.

104
00:04:25,937 --> 00:04:27,771
That's the Flight Director of NASA.

105
00:04:27,773 --> 00:04:29,606
They're probably debating
on how to talk to the press

106
00:04:29,608 --> 00:04:32,659
about the oxygen tank
explosion on "Apollo 13."

107
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,332
Henry.

108
00:04:39,334 --> 00:04:42,085
Great to see you.

109
00:04:42,087 --> 00:04:43,620
Oh!

110
00:04:46,792 --> 00:04:50,043
You son of a bitch.

111
00:04:50,045 --> 00:04:51,878
Sorry, folks.

112
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,465
He doesn't have the right credentials.

113
00:04:55,467 --> 00:04:58,968
We take press access very
seriously around here.

114
00:05:03,775 --> 00:05:05,775
Surprise!

115
00:05:05,777 --> 00:05:07,060
We're back.

116
00:05:08,647 --> 00:05:11,314
Why are you doing this, Henry?

117
00:05:11,316 --> 00:05:14,984
I was never supposed to see him again.

118
00:05:14,986 --> 00:05:16,953
So you punched him?

119
00:05:16,955 --> 00:05:19,405
That's between him and me.

120
00:05:19,407 --> 00:05:21,658
What brings you to 1970?

121
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,161
Oh, well, I supposed Nate
should probably tell you.

122
00:05:25,163 --> 00:05:26,412
Nathaniel's here too?

123
00:05:26,414 --> 00:05:27,997
Sir?

124
00:05:27,999 --> 00:05:29,999
They say they know you.

125
00:05:30,001 --> 00:05:31,835
You could say that.

126
00:05:31,837 --> 00:05:33,336
Henry.

127
00:05:33,338 --> 00:05:35,471
Amaya.

128
00:05:35,473 --> 00:05:38,424
As I live and breathe.

129
00:05:41,513 --> 00:05:42,762
It's good to see you again, son.

130
00:05:42,764 --> 00:05:45,181
Come here, man.

131
00:05:45,183 --> 00:05:47,150
I thought I'd never see you again.

132
00:05:47,152 --> 00:05:48,484
Look at you, you still got it.

133
00:05:48,486 --> 00:05:51,271
Is that Rip?

134
00:05:51,273 --> 00:05:52,989
Get him out of there!

135
00:05:52,991 --> 00:05:56,526
As soon as one of you explains
what in tarnation is going on.

136
00:05:56,528 --> 00:05:59,529
We're here for your fragment
of the Spear of Destiny.

137
00:05:59,531 --> 00:06:01,080
See, there's a Legion of villains

138
00:06:01,082 --> 00:06:03,032
who are hunting anyone who
is trying to protect it.

139
00:06:03,034 --> 00:06:04,367
We have Stargirl's fragment.

140
00:06:04,369 --> 00:06:07,587
But... Mid-Nite died
trying to protect his.

141
00:06:12,177 --> 00:06:14,961
I appreciate your concern,

142
00:06:14,963 --> 00:06:17,130
but I hid my piece of
the Spear somewhere safe.

143
00:06:17,132 --> 00:06:18,882
Believe me, there's no place on Earth

144
00:06:18,884 --> 00:06:20,049
safe from these guys.

145
00:06:20,051 --> 00:06:23,853
Exactly.

146
00:06:23,855 --> 00:06:27,106
You old fox you.

147
00:06:27,108 --> 00:06:28,141
You want to clue us in?

148
00:06:28,143 --> 00:06:30,977
He hid the Spear in the flag

149
00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:33,279
Neil Armstrong planted on the moon.

150
00:06:33,281 --> 00:06:35,148
Well, that is pretty ingenious.

151
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,866
The whole reason I worked
my way up through NASA

152
00:06:36,868 --> 00:06:40,653
was to make sure my piece
of the Spear remains safe.

153
00:06:40,655 --> 00:06:43,823
Speaking of, I really should be
getting back to Mission Control.

154
00:06:43,825 --> 00:06:45,158
Yeah, I guess you gotta
figure out how to save

155
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,576
the "Apollo 13" astronauts.

156
00:06:46,578 --> 00:06:48,544
What are you talking about?

157
00:06:48,546 --> 00:06:50,246
The mission is textbook.

158
00:06:50,248 --> 00:06:53,249
Didn't an oxygen tank explode

159
00:06:53,251 --> 00:06:54,968
and the moon landing get aborted?

160
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:58,304
No, everything is going great up there.

161
00:06:58,306 --> 00:07:00,173
Unless...

162
00:07:00,175 --> 00:07:01,891
Unless...

163
00:07:01,893 --> 00:07:03,843
history's changed.

164
00:07:15,657 --> 00:07:18,324
Houston, we are about to enter
the dark side of the moon.

165
00:07:18,326 --> 00:07:20,410
Loss of signal in 30 seconds.

166
00:07:20,412 --> 00:07:21,945
Roger that, "Odyssey."

167
00:07:21,947 --> 00:07:23,329
See you in 28 minutes.

168
00:07:23,331 --> 00:07:25,448
Happy sailing.

169
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:26,833
Over and out.

170
00:07:26,835 --> 00:07:31,371
Time to sit back and
enjoy the view, fellas.

171
00:07:31,373 --> 00:07:32,705
Sorry, fellas.

172
00:07:32,707 --> 00:07:34,624
Change of plans.

173
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:01,820
We have to intercept "Apollo
13" before it lands on the Moon.

174
00:08:01,822 --> 00:08:04,306
Where's Commander Heywood? He
and I need to have a little chat.

175
00:08:04,308 --> 00:08:06,975
He's introducing the rest of
the team to the Flight Director.

176
00:08:06,977 --> 00:08:08,559
Interesting. Why?

177
00:08:08,561 --> 00:08:11,145
Because we need somebody
monitoring on the ground.

178
00:08:14,184 --> 00:08:15,767
These are flight controllers?

179
00:08:15,769 --> 00:08:17,602
Yes. They're with the, uh,

180
00:08:17,604 --> 00:08:19,604
British Space Program.

181
00:08:19,606 --> 00:08:21,689
They're here to study our procedures.

182
00:08:21,691 --> 00:08:23,858
What's your area of expertise?

183
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,110
I'm a Booster Systems Engineer.

184
00:08:26,112 --> 00:08:28,579
They call me "the Rocket Man."

185
00:08:28,581 --> 00:08:30,248
And him?

186
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,950
Uh, he's a man of few words,

187
00:08:31,952 --> 00:08:34,118
but makes up for it with... personality.

188
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,920
All right. Fine.

189
00:08:35,922 --> 00:08:38,456
But if any of you Brits get
in the way of my controllers

190
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:41,009
or jeopardize the safe
return of our astronauts,

191
00:08:41,011 --> 00:08:41,960
you'll answer to me.

192
00:08:41,962 --> 00:08:44,128
Of course.

193
00:08:46,383 --> 00:08:48,099
All right.

194
00:08:48,101 --> 00:08:50,134
- Good luck, fellas.
- You're not sticking around?

195
00:08:50,136 --> 00:08:52,136
We might need you to run a
little more interference for us.

196
00:08:52,138 --> 00:08:54,806
No can do. I gave up my life for that Spear

197
00:08:54,808 --> 00:08:57,608
and I'll be damned if I
let anyone steal it now.

198
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,610
I'm going with my grandson to space.

199
00:09:08,905 --> 00:09:10,405
Would you look at that?

200
00:09:10,407 --> 00:09:12,156
Outer space.

201
00:09:12,158 --> 00:09:13,624
Never gets old.

202
00:09:13,626 --> 00:09:15,793
Martin, how much longer before "Apollo 13"

203
00:09:15,795 --> 00:09:16,911
should reestablish radio contact?

204
00:09:16,913 --> 00:09:18,796
17 minutes.

205
00:09:18,798 --> 00:09:21,916
All right, we got 17 minutes
to figure out what's going on

206
00:09:21,918 --> 00:09:23,217
before the whole world is watching.

207
00:09:23,219 --> 00:09:24,752
Yeah, you're not wrong there.

208
00:09:24,754 --> 00:09:27,422
Gideon, pull up "Apollo
13's" original flight pattern.

209
00:09:27,424 --> 00:09:29,307
We need to find it first.

210
00:09:29,309 --> 00:09:30,975
Mm, uh, Henry.

211
00:09:30,977 --> 00:09:32,894
Perhaps now would be a
good time to have a chat?

212
00:09:32,896 --> 00:09:36,647
Actually, Captain Hunter, I
don't feel much like talking.

213
00:09:52,582 --> 00:09:54,082
Are you okay?

214
00:09:54,084 --> 00:09:56,250
Yeah, I'm fine.

215
00:09:56,252 --> 00:10:00,538
You know, in 2017, men
share their feelings.

216
00:10:01,925 --> 00:10:03,207
I'm just saying.

217
00:10:03,209 --> 00:10:07,512
My wife has spent the past 14 years

218
00:10:07,514 --> 00:10:11,349
raising our son by herself.

219
00:10:11,351 --> 00:10:13,684
And it is Captain Hunter's fault.

220
00:10:13,686 --> 00:10:15,937
The man has a wife and son,

221
00:10:15,939 --> 00:10:18,606
and still he asked me to abandon mine.

222
00:10:18,608 --> 00:10:20,641
He doesn't have a family.

223
00:10:20,643 --> 00:10:22,727
I mean, he did.

224
00:10:22,729 --> 00:10:24,278
It's just...

225
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,531
they were killed.

226
00:10:27,817 --> 00:10:30,401
I-I didn't know.

227
00:10:30,403 --> 00:10:33,154
You know, I often wonder what
Hank would have been like,

228
00:10:33,156 --> 00:10:34,489
if you hadn't left.

229
00:10:34,491 --> 00:10:36,624
Yeah, I call my dad Hank.

230
00:10:36,626 --> 00:10:38,576
We don't have the best relationship.

231
00:10:38,578 --> 00:10:40,461
But I don't need to tell you all that.

232
00:10:40,463 --> 00:10:42,914
I'm sorry, Nathaniel.

233
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:46,084
This is all my fault.

234
00:10:46,086 --> 00:10:48,920
But once this is over,
I'm getting Captain Hunter

235
00:10:48,922 --> 00:10:50,588
to take me back to 1956,

236
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:53,975
to the day I abandoned Bettie and Hank.

237
00:10:53,977 --> 00:10:56,677
Wait, I was... I was just
talking hypothetically.

238
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:58,596
Why?

239
00:10:58,598 --> 00:11:00,681
I mean, this is a timeship, isn't it?

240
00:11:00,683 --> 00:11:03,234
It'll be like I never left my wife and son.

241
00:11:03,236 --> 00:11:05,186
Think of all the heartbreak
I could save them.

242
00:11:05,188 --> 00:11:08,022
Huh, I never thought of it that way.

243
00:11:09,492 --> 00:11:12,693
I'm sorry to interrupt.
But we found "Apollo 13."

244
00:11:14,197 --> 00:11:15,613
Oh, this isn't right.

245
00:11:15,615 --> 00:11:17,832
The spacecraft shouldn't
be in this position.

246
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:19,167
Can the astronauts see us?

247
00:11:19,169 --> 00:11:20,751
No, no, no. We're cloaked.

248
00:11:20,753 --> 00:11:22,537
- What's our plan?
- Well, I thought that we...

249
00:11:22,539 --> 00:11:24,122
All right. I've got Ray suiting up.

250
00:11:24,124 --> 00:11:26,207
He's gonna fly over there, shrink down,

251
00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:28,459
and let us know what's going on inside.

252
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:39,353
I'm entering the Command Module.

253
00:11:43,393 --> 00:11:46,060
I see Lovell and Haise,
but they're unconscious.

254
00:11:46,062 --> 00:11:47,645
What about Jack?

255
00:11:47,647 --> 00:11:49,780
Dr. Palmer?

256
00:11:49,782 --> 00:11:50,781
Thawne's here.

257
00:11:52,318 --> 00:11:54,368
I'm gonna follow him into the Lunar Module.

258
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:56,571
He's going to land on the moon.

259
00:11:56,573 --> 00:11:57,905
Well, I'll stop him.

260
00:12:11,004 --> 00:12:12,887
Who's Thawne? Where is Swigert?

261
00:12:12,889 --> 00:12:15,173
Ray, whatever you do, just
don't let Thawne see you.

262
00:12:15,175 --> 00:12:17,475
Yeah, about that...

263
00:12:17,477 --> 00:12:20,094
Well, what do we have here?

264
00:12:20,096 --> 00:12:22,263
Looks like a stowaway.

265
00:12:37,581 --> 00:12:38,997
What's happening?

266
00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:41,783
NASA expects radio
contact in three minutes!

267
00:12:41,785 --> 00:12:43,452
We ran into a problem.

268
00:12:43,454 --> 00:12:45,454
If we come back online, you're
gonna have to cut the feed.

269
00:12:45,456 --> 00:12:46,955
Yeah, I'm on it.

270
00:12:46,957 --> 00:12:49,091
He doesn't have superspeed without gravity.

271
00:12:49,093 --> 00:12:50,626
Newsflash, Raymond:

272
00:12:50,628 --> 00:12:53,128
I don't need superspeed to kick your ass.

273
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:27,579
What's the red button?

274
00:13:27,581 --> 00:13:29,881
It separates the LEM
from the Command Module.

275
00:13:29,883 --> 00:13:31,333
That's not good.

276
00:13:31,335 --> 00:13:33,719
Dr. Palmer, you're gonna
have to fly the LEM.

277
00:13:47,851 --> 00:13:49,651
Houston, we have a problem.

278
00:13:49,653 --> 00:13:51,853
Yeah, tell me something I don't know.

279
00:13:51,855 --> 00:13:53,355
Jefferson, the entire world

280
00:13:53,357 --> 00:13:56,191
is about to listen to
Raymond crash on the moon.

281
00:13:56,193 --> 00:13:57,326
Wait.

282
00:13:57,328 --> 00:13:59,111
Haircut's on the moon.

283
00:13:59,113 --> 00:14:01,530
Guys, I'm gonna need more time.

284
00:14:01,532 --> 00:14:03,665
I need you to create a distraction.

285
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,959
Day-o!

286
00:14:13,961 --> 00:14:17,012

What the hell are you two playing at?

301
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,926
Okay. I got it.

302
00:15:04,928 --> 00:15:06,428
I cut the feed.

303
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:08,146
Oh, it's a...

304
00:15:08,148 --> 00:15:09,765
It's a British tradition, sir.

305
00:15:09,767 --> 00:15:12,434
Flight, I had radio contact for a second,

306
00:15:12,436 --> 00:15:13,852
then I lost it again.

307
00:15:13,854 --> 00:15:16,271
- Nice voice, Professor.
- Thank you very much.

308
00:15:16,273 --> 00:15:18,323
- Guidance?
- It was the darnedest thing.

309
00:15:18,325 --> 00:15:20,075
The LEM appeared for a second,

310
00:15:20,077 --> 00:15:22,527
but it looked like it was about
to crash on the lunar surface.

311
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:24,529
Where the hell is the Command Module?

312
00:15:26,417 --> 00:15:29,284
It's spinning off course.

313
00:15:29,286 --> 00:15:30,335
Ray.

314
00:15:30,337 --> 00:15:31,503
Are you all right?

315
00:15:32,956 --> 00:15:34,706
I'm alive at least.

316
00:15:36,176 --> 00:15:38,343
I was able to salvage the descent.

317
00:15:38,345 --> 00:15:40,262
But it burned up too much fuel.

318
00:15:40,264 --> 00:15:42,380
There is no way the LEM
will launch into space.

319
00:15:42,382 --> 00:15:43,799
What about your suit?

320
00:15:43,801 --> 00:15:45,767
My thrusters were damaged in the fight.

321
00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:48,353
You guys are gonna have to pick me up.

322
00:15:48,355 --> 00:15:50,222
NASA must be going berserk right now.

323
00:15:50,224 --> 00:15:52,190
Fred and Jim...

324
00:15:52,192 --> 00:15:54,860
Don't worry, we're gonna get
"Apollo 13" home in one piece.

325
00:15:54,862 --> 00:15:57,112
Gideon, plot a course
for the Command Module.

326
00:15:57,114 --> 00:15:58,280
Right away, Captain.

327
00:15:58,282 --> 00:15:59,397
Ray, we'll pick you up later.

328
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:00,699
Roger that.

329
00:16:00,701 --> 00:16:01,983
We landed near the Sea of Tranquility.

330
00:16:01,985 --> 00:16:03,735
So I'm gonna head out

331
00:16:03,737 --> 00:16:06,037
and retrieve Commander
Heywood's piece of the Spear.

332
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:08,540
Which is, needless to say,

333
00:16:08,542 --> 00:16:09,574
very exciting.

334
00:16:09,576 --> 00:16:10,659
Good luck, big guy.

335
00:16:10,661 --> 00:16:12,043
What about Mr. Thawne?

336
00:16:12,045 --> 00:16:14,329
He's a little tied up at the moment.

337
00:16:15,415 --> 00:16:18,633
Puns, the lowest form of humor.

338
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,253
Can I talk to you?

339
00:16:21,255 --> 00:16:23,004
About what?

340
00:16:28,178 --> 00:16:29,811
I overheard you and Henry

341
00:16:29,813 --> 00:16:32,514
talking about returning him to 1956.

342
00:16:32,516 --> 00:16:34,065
Okay, look, I know what you're gonna say...

343
00:16:34,067 --> 00:16:37,185
That you're a historian
as well as a Legend.

344
00:16:37,187 --> 00:16:39,688
You know the consequences of
returning Henry to the timeline.

345
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:42,190
Yeah, my dad grows up with a father.

346
00:16:42,192 --> 00:16:44,442
Look, my childhood was miserable.

347
00:16:44,444 --> 00:16:48,196
My dad was a cold, disconnected jackass.

348
00:16:48,198 --> 00:16:51,416
But maybe, just maybe,

349
00:16:51,418 --> 00:16:53,869
returning Henry to that
time could change everything.

350
00:16:53,871 --> 00:16:58,373
This is my chance to fix three
generations of Heywood men.

351
00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:00,792
You don't need fixing.

352
00:17:00,794 --> 00:17:03,929
Your childhood made you
into the man that you are,

353
00:17:03,931 --> 00:17:07,549
the person that you are today.

354
00:17:07,551 --> 00:17:09,217
And without that man,

355
00:17:09,219 --> 00:17:11,887
then, well, this ship would
probably still be stuck

356
00:17:11,889 --> 00:17:13,772
at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.

357
00:17:13,774 --> 00:17:16,057
That's conjecture.

358
00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:18,643
My grandfather's happiness,
my father's happiness,

359
00:17:18,645 --> 00:17:19,561
that's real.

360
00:17:19,563 --> 00:17:21,062
Excuse the interruption.

361
00:17:21,064 --> 00:17:22,981
But you might want to brace for impact.

362
00:17:26,236 --> 00:17:28,203
Good news, we found the Command Module.

363
00:17:28,205 --> 00:17:30,872
Bad news, it's heading straight
for a bunch of space rocks.

364
00:17:30,874 --> 00:17:33,158
- The meteoroid belt.
- Don't we have a tractor beam?

365
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,493
Can we pull the Command Module
away from the meteorites?

366
00:17:35,495 --> 00:17:37,746
No, no, the velocity of the Command Module

367
00:17:37,748 --> 00:17:39,831
would merely bring us
closer to the meteorites.

368
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,833
Which is why I'm swinging the ship around.

369
00:17:41,835 --> 00:17:43,084
I'm gonna try and stop

370
00:17:43,086 --> 00:17:44,803
the trajectory of the Command Module.

371
00:17:55,265 --> 00:17:56,815
Sara, you need to abort.

372
00:17:56,817 --> 00:17:58,066
We're going to hit the meteoroids.

373
00:17:58,068 --> 00:17:59,651
Better us than the Command Module.

374
00:18:03,607 --> 00:18:05,907
Can't you at least to try
to destroy the meteoroids

375
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:08,276
rather than using my
ship as a human shield?

376
00:18:08,278 --> 00:18:10,161
It worked before back in 1942.

377
00:18:10,163 --> 00:18:11,913
You put the Waverider in front of a nuke

378
00:18:11,915 --> 00:18:13,665
and it absorbed the blast.

379
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:15,700
At least I had the decency
to time-scatter you all first.

380
00:18:15,702 --> 00:18:17,452
Decency? Did you ask any of us

381
00:18:17,454 --> 00:18:18,787
- if we wanted to be time-scattered?
- _

382
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:20,121
- Sara.
- I was trying

383
00:18:20,123 --> 00:18:21,423
to save your lives!

384
00:18:21,425 --> 00:18:22,841
You put me in a time period

385
00:18:22,843 --> 00:18:24,793
where they wanted to
hang me for being a witch!

386
00:18:24,795 --> 00:18:25,794
Sara!

387
00:18:28,265 --> 00:18:31,800
Shield integrity at 63%.

388
00:18:31,802 --> 00:18:33,969
34%.

389
00:18:33,971 --> 00:18:36,471
Rerouting the reserve power to the shields.

390
00:18:38,642 --> 00:18:41,142
I'm afraid the Jumpship has
been critically impaired.

391
00:18:41,144 --> 00:18:42,527
Oh, dear.

392
00:18:42,529 --> 00:18:45,697
Our landing gear has...

393
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:54,322
We're clear.

394
00:19:42,255 --> 00:19:44,205
Waverider crew,

395
00:19:44,207 --> 00:19:46,541
we are now the proud
owners of the last fragment

396
00:19:46,543 --> 00:19:48,343
of the Spear of Destiny.

397
00:19:48,345 --> 00:19:50,378
Copy.

398
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,796
Copy.

399
00:19:51,798 --> 00:19:53,765
That's all I get is a "copy"?

400
00:19:53,767 --> 00:19:55,550
Guys, I'm standing on the freakin' moon!

401
00:19:55,552 --> 00:19:57,686
Yeah, about that.

402
00:19:57,688 --> 00:20:00,021
The, uh, the Waverider has sustained

403
00:20:00,023 --> 00:20:01,306
major damage, Dr. Palmer.

404
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:04,442
Same for the Jumpship.

405
00:20:04,444 --> 00:20:07,395
Wait, the Jumpship... That means...

406
00:20:07,397 --> 00:20:10,315
Unless you can figure out
a way to launch the LEM...

407
00:20:12,184 --> 00:20:14,867
You're stranded on the moon.

408
00:20:14,869 --> 00:20:17,572
And now I know how Matt Damon felt.

409
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,375
I'm Dr. Raymond Palmer. Time traveler,

410
00:20:29,377 --> 00:20:33,158
superhero, and most recently, astronaut.

411
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,983
It's April 13th, 1970, at 2200 hours,

412
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:38,763
and I am stranded on the moon.

413
00:20:38,765 --> 00:20:41,850
Fuel on the LEM is close to zero.

414
00:20:41,852 --> 00:20:43,351
The food and water provisions

415
00:20:43,353 --> 00:20:46,638
were designed to last days, not months.

416
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,057
So, yeah,

417
00:20:49,059 --> 00:20:51,676
I'm gonna have to science
the crap out of this.

418
00:20:51,678 --> 00:20:53,678
What are you doing?

419
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,348
I'm filming us for posterity.

420
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,349
In case we don't...

421
00:20:57,351 --> 00:20:58,767
make it back.

422
00:20:58,769 --> 00:21:00,602
I'm not dying on the moon.

423
00:21:00,604 --> 00:21:02,654
Sign... signing off.

424
00:21:02,656 --> 00:21:03,675
Certainly not doing it

425
00:21:03,677 --> 00:21:07,275
in a tin can with the likes of you.

426
00:21:07,277 --> 00:21:09,728
And to that end, I propose an alliance.

427
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:11,863
You untie me and we'll figure out a way

428
00:21:11,865 --> 00:21:14,783
to get ourselves off this rock.

429
00:21:14,785 --> 00:21:17,953
And I'll play nice until
we get back to Earth.

430
00:21:17,955 --> 00:21:19,537
I promise.

431
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:21,373
Yeah.

432
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:23,325
Not a chance.

433
00:21:23,327 --> 00:21:26,828
And for your information,
I already have a plan.

434
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:29,998
All I have to do is transfer
the fuel source from my exo-suit

435
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,050
and power the fuel cells.

436
00:21:32,052 --> 00:21:34,502
Use the dwarf star to power the LEM.

437
00:21:34,504 --> 00:21:36,304
Yeah, that should work.

438
00:21:36,306 --> 00:21:40,342
Of course you've taken the
gas spectrometer into account.

439
00:21:41,845 --> 00:21:44,763
Well, unless you adjust
for the relative volatility

440
00:21:44,765 --> 00:21:49,184
of dwarf star, then the LEM
could explode mid-launch.

441
00:21:49,186 --> 00:21:51,903
I'm a scientist from the future

442
00:21:51,905 --> 00:21:54,689
and I'm here to tell you,
this is a two-person patch job.

443
00:21:54,691 --> 00:21:56,775
Look at it this way:

444
00:21:56,777 --> 00:21:59,494
If I'm lying, we're both dead.

445
00:22:05,118 --> 00:22:08,119
We'll be over Ray's launch
position in 18 minutes.

446
00:22:08,121 --> 00:22:09,871
We only get one chance at this intercept

447
00:22:09,873 --> 00:22:12,173
before the moon's gravity
slingshots us back to Earth.

448
00:22:12,175 --> 00:22:14,042
Henry.

449
00:22:14,044 --> 00:22:16,344
You need to understand
how time travel works.

450
00:22:16,346 --> 00:22:18,430
My grandfather understands it just fine.

451
00:22:18,432 --> 00:22:19,931
You can't return to 1956.

452
00:22:19,933 --> 00:22:22,717
- Amaya.
- Why?

453
00:22:24,304 --> 00:22:25,770
Every time we change history,

454
00:22:25,772 --> 00:22:28,356
we create what we call an Aberration.

455
00:22:28,358 --> 00:22:30,392
Now, if your son grows up with you around,

456
00:22:30,394 --> 00:22:32,861
he could become an
entirely different person,

457
00:22:32,863 --> 00:22:34,612
choose a different life.

458
00:22:34,614 --> 00:22:37,198
That, in turn, could change Nathaniel

459
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,117
and the person he becomes.

460
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:40,702
If he's even born at all.

461
00:22:40,704 --> 00:22:43,238
She doesn't know that.

462
00:22:44,574 --> 00:22:46,374
But it's a possibility?

463
00:22:46,376 --> 00:22:48,243
Yes.

464
00:22:54,418 --> 00:22:56,251
Why didn't you tell me?

465
00:22:56,253 --> 00:22:59,254
Because my dad needs you.

466
00:23:00,557 --> 00:23:02,891
And as much as I want to protect history,

467
00:23:02,893 --> 00:23:05,093
I want to protect our family more.

468
00:23:05,095 --> 00:23:08,596
We both should have learned by
now, the mission comes first.

469
00:23:11,435 --> 00:23:13,685
Thank you for telling me.

470
00:23:22,779 --> 00:23:25,613
I was just trying to protect you.

471
00:23:25,615 --> 00:23:28,116
Nathaniel, changing your family's history

472
00:23:28,118 --> 00:23:29,784
would have changed you.

473
00:23:29,786 --> 00:23:31,786
And in case I haven't made it clear,

474
00:23:31,788 --> 00:23:33,705
I like who you are.

475
00:23:33,707 --> 00:23:36,624
You and I don't have a future together.

476
00:23:36,626 --> 00:23:38,093
What do you mean?

477
00:23:38,095 --> 00:23:40,795
When you stowed aboard the Waverider,

478
00:23:40,797 --> 00:23:42,380
we pulled you from the timeline.

479
00:23:42,382 --> 00:23:44,349
Back in 1942,

480
00:23:44,351 --> 00:23:46,601
you have a destiny waiting for you.

481
00:23:46,603 --> 00:23:47,886
How do you know all this?

482
00:23:47,888 --> 00:23:49,304
Ray told me.

483
00:23:49,306 --> 00:23:50,805
He knows your granddaughter.

484
00:23:50,807 --> 00:23:52,390
I don't think I should be hearing this.

485
00:23:52,392 --> 00:23:54,976
Ask Ray what happens to your village.

486
00:23:54,978 --> 00:23:58,113
Ask him what happens to your
daughter and your granddaughter,

487
00:23:58,115 --> 00:24:00,648
then tell me,

488
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:04,702
tell me you'll choose
history over your own family.

489
00:24:18,218 --> 00:24:20,135
That offer to clear the air still good?

490
00:24:20,137 --> 00:24:22,971
So long as it doesn't involve
punching me in the jaw again.

491
00:24:24,724 --> 00:24:26,841
I'm sorry about that.

492
00:24:26,843 --> 00:24:28,510
After five years,

493
00:24:28,512 --> 00:24:32,814
I found myself blaming
you for the choice I made.

494
00:24:32,816 --> 00:24:35,600
Turns out that abandoning my wife and son,

495
00:24:35,602 --> 00:24:39,270
even to save the world, was... a mistake.

496
00:24:39,272 --> 00:24:43,525
Oh, it's the great irony of time travel,

497
00:24:43,527 --> 00:24:46,444
that, despite it, we still find
ourselves living with regret.

498
00:24:46,446 --> 00:24:48,196
One of mine is that I couldn't find

499
00:24:48,198 --> 00:24:50,448
a better way to protect the Spear.

500
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:51,866
One that would've...

501
00:24:51,868 --> 00:24:54,335
spared you such a personal sacrifice.

502
00:24:54,337 --> 00:24:57,172
When you showed up, I
thought maybe I could go back,

503
00:24:57,174 --> 00:24:58,756
change history.

504
00:24:58,758 --> 00:25:01,793
But what's done is done.

505
00:25:01,795 --> 00:25:05,213
All we can do now is look forward.

506
00:25:12,389 --> 00:25:15,723
Oh, I gotta say, you really
turned this team around.

507
00:25:15,725 --> 00:25:18,143
When I met the Legends in 1942,

508
00:25:18,145 --> 00:25:19,811
they were constantly bickering.

509
00:25:19,813 --> 00:25:21,980
Unable to work together
in any cohesive way.

510
00:25:21,982 --> 00:25:25,400
Actually, I'm not the one
who deserves your praise.

511
00:25:39,633 --> 00:25:41,216
Menial labor

512
00:25:41,218 --> 00:25:46,387
without superspeed is really quite tedious.

513
00:25:46,389 --> 00:25:50,842
Then again, I've missed
working with a fellow scientist.

514
00:25:50,844 --> 00:25:53,595
Cisco and Caitlin and I, as you know,

515
00:25:53,597 --> 00:25:56,347
worked together for some time and...

516
00:25:56,349 --> 00:25:58,266
I miss the camaraderie.

517
00:25:58,268 --> 00:26:00,935
Legion of Doom doesn't
have Karaoke Fridays?

518
00:26:00,937 --> 00:26:03,271
I know it's easier for you
to think of me as a monster.

519
00:26:03,273 --> 00:26:07,609
But, um, I've met some of
history's monsters, Raymond,

520
00:26:07,611 --> 00:26:09,110
and believe me,

521
00:26:09,112 --> 00:26:10,445
I'm not one of them.

522
00:26:10,447 --> 00:26:12,413
You killed Barry's mother.

523
00:26:12,415 --> 00:26:13,948
Twice.

524
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:15,867
Rex Tyler.

525
00:26:15,869 --> 00:26:17,585
Brainwashed Rip into killing Dr. Mid-Nite.

526
00:26:17,587 --> 00:26:20,838
Time travel has a way of
revealing the truth to you.

527
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,790
And you and I have more
in common than you think.

528
00:26:22,792 --> 00:26:24,926
Pass me the pliers.

529
00:26:26,179 --> 00:26:27,762
We're both scientists.

530
00:26:27,764 --> 00:26:30,131
We're both obsessed with
achieving the impossible.

531
00:26:30,133 --> 00:26:31,966
You dedicated your life to learning

532
00:26:31,968 --> 00:26:33,935
how to shrink yourself
down to the size of an atom,

533
00:26:33,937 --> 00:26:37,138
and I spent mine learning the
secrets of the Speed Force.

534
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,390
I became the Atom to help people.

535
00:26:40,977 --> 00:26:43,861
You could use the dwarf star

536
00:26:43,863 --> 00:26:46,447
in your expo-suit to power an entire city.

537
00:26:46,449 --> 00:26:49,067
But instead, you chose to become the Atom

538
00:26:49,069 --> 00:26:50,368
because you weren't satisfied

539
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:54,656
with your small, pathetic life.

540
00:26:54,658 --> 00:26:58,793
There is no shame in wanting
to be great or to reach higher.

541
00:26:58,795 --> 00:27:01,329
To...

542
00:27:01,331 --> 00:27:03,047
walk on the moon.

543
00:27:03,049 --> 00:27:05,883
Is that why you want the Spear?

544
00:27:05,885 --> 00:27:09,470
Reach higher, become greater, run faster?

545
00:27:09,472 --> 00:27:12,223
No.

546
00:27:12,225 --> 00:27:16,227
I'm after something much more...

547
00:27:16,229 --> 00:27:18,479
elemental.

548
00:27:18,481 --> 00:27:20,898
I want to live.

549
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:27,155
Surely, you can sympathize.

550
00:27:27,157 --> 00:27:28,940
One minute to the intercept, Raymond.

551
00:27:28,942 --> 00:27:30,441
Are you ready up there?

552
00:27:30,443 --> 00:27:32,944
Yeah, we're ready.

553
00:27:32,946 --> 00:27:34,112
"We"?

554
00:27:34,114 --> 00:27:35,363
Long story.

555
00:27:35,365 --> 00:27:36,748
Let's do this.

556
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:39,250
Rip, how's our trajectory looking?

557
00:27:39,252 --> 00:27:41,119
Keep her steady.

558
00:27:41,121 --> 00:27:43,588
Martin, are you sure
about these calculations?

559
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:45,173
I'm piloting manually here.

560
00:27:45,175 --> 00:27:47,675
Did I or did I not win six Carlins?

561
00:27:47,677 --> 00:27:48,710
No.

562
00:27:48,712 --> 00:27:50,295
Yes, I did.

563
00:27:50,297 --> 00:27:52,046
20 seconds to intercept.

564
00:27:52,048 --> 00:27:55,016
Jax, be prepared to restore
the feed on my signal.

565
00:27:55,018 --> 00:27:56,017
Ten seconds.

566
00:27:58,688 --> 00:28:00,688
You're just gonna have to trust me.

567
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:03,474
In three, two, one...

568
00:28:23,663 --> 00:28:26,214
Distance to target, 100 meters.

569
00:28:28,218 --> 00:28:29,584
And closing fast.

570
00:28:50,607 --> 00:28:52,857
Intercept successful.

571
00:28:52,859 --> 00:28:55,109
You, ma'am, are a steely-eyed missile man!

572
00:28:55,111 --> 00:28:56,611
I take that as a compliment.

573
00:28:56,613 --> 00:28:58,529
Ray, I'm gonna dock with the LEM.

574
00:28:58,531 --> 00:29:00,665
Be prepared to get your
ass back on the ship.

575
00:29:00,667 --> 00:29:02,750
Copy.

576
00:29:02,752 --> 00:29:04,786
Head up, son. We got work to do.

577
00:29:04,788 --> 00:29:08,623
I'm sorry, sir, but they're just... gone.

578
00:29:09,509 --> 00:29:11,876
Tractor beam disengaged.

579
00:29:11,878 --> 00:29:13,928
"Apollo 13" is headed home.

580
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:16,013
Jax, restore the feed.

581
00:29:16,015 --> 00:29:20,268
Let's get history back on track.

582
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:23,638
_

583
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,723
"Odyssey," this is Houston. Do you read us?

584
00:29:25,725 --> 00:29:27,809
Come in, "Odyssey."
"Odyssey," this is Houston.

585
00:29:27,811 --> 00:29:30,311
Houston, this is "Odyssey," do you read me?

586
00:29:30,313 --> 00:29:32,196
I repeat, do you read me?

587
00:29:32,198 --> 00:29:34,065
We read you, "Odyssey."

588
00:29:34,067 --> 00:29:35,116
Loud and clear.

589
00:29:47,497 --> 00:29:50,965
You don't seem happy, Professor.

590
00:29:50,967 --> 00:29:54,585
The intercept might have
been a success, but...

591
00:29:54,587 --> 00:29:56,637
the Waverider is on reserve power.

592
00:29:56,639 --> 00:29:58,089
Not to mention the difficulty

593
00:29:58,091 --> 00:30:00,725
of re-entering the Earth's atmosphere.

594
00:30:00,727 --> 00:30:02,226
What are you saying?

595
00:30:02,228 --> 00:30:04,562
I'm saying that our crew

596
00:30:04,564 --> 00:30:08,683
has an infinitesimal chance
of ever returning home.

597
00:30:08,685 --> 00:30:11,986
By "infinitesimal," I mean...

598
00:30:11,988 --> 00:30:14,322
A snowball's chance in hell?

599
00:30:14,324 --> 00:30:17,825
That would look rosy in comparison.

600
00:30:30,604 --> 00:30:33,307
Welcome aboard.

601
00:30:35,344 --> 00:30:36,677
Relax.

602
00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:38,542
I'm not gonna kill my ride home.

603
00:30:38,544 --> 00:30:41,064
Yeah, we still don't trust you.

604
00:30:41,066 --> 00:30:43,600
Rip Hunter. It's good to see you.

605
00:30:43,602 --> 00:30:45,269
I guess these morons figured out a way

606
00:30:45,271 --> 00:30:47,187
to restore your original personality.

607
00:30:47,189 --> 00:30:50,157
Mm. Enjoy the brig, Eobard.

608
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,327
I've been waiting for this for a long time.

609
00:31:02,037 --> 00:31:04,454
Sara, you have to power down

610
00:31:04,456 --> 00:31:06,957
every non-essential piece
of hardware on the ship.

611
00:31:06,959 --> 00:31:08,709
Gideon is already shut down.

612
00:31:08,711 --> 00:31:12,879
Waverider is using gravitational
inertia to float back to Earth.

613
00:31:12,881 --> 00:31:14,014
What? I know science.

614
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:16,300
It isn't enough.

615
00:31:16,302 --> 00:31:18,385
If you want to activate the heat shields,

616
00:31:18,387 --> 00:31:21,305
and survive re-entry, you have
to conserve more power now.

617
00:31:21,307 --> 00:31:22,606
Stein is right.

618
00:31:22,608 --> 00:31:24,057
We need to shut down the water filtration

619
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:25,275
and the heating systems.

620
00:31:25,277 --> 00:31:27,060
Right, because clean water and heat,

621
00:31:27,062 --> 00:31:28,395
we don't need those to survive.

622
00:31:28,397 --> 00:31:30,948
You got a better idea?

623
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:33,567
At the moment, no.

624
00:31:33,569 --> 00:31:35,819
Well, bundle up, 'cause
it's about to get chilly.

625
00:31:35,821 --> 00:31:37,704
Actually, if the shields don't work,

626
00:31:37,706 --> 00:31:40,207
atmospheric re-entry'll
burn us all to a crisp.

627
00:31:41,327 --> 00:31:43,577
Science.

628
00:31:47,166 --> 00:31:49,633
- You lost, son?
- No, sir.

629
00:31:49,635 --> 00:31:52,085
I won a contest to see "Apollo 13" land.

630
00:31:52,087 --> 00:31:53,053
I-I'm Hank.

631
00:31:53,055 --> 00:31:54,388
Hank Heywood.

632
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:56,757
This place is turning into a damn circus.

633
00:31:56,759 --> 00:31:59,259
Stein, we're ready for re-entry.

634
00:31:59,261 --> 00:32:01,845
What's the status of
your secondary thrusters?

635
00:32:01,847 --> 00:32:03,313
It's sporadic.

636
00:32:03,315 --> 00:32:05,349
She's still got a couple
pushes left in her.

637
00:32:05,351 --> 00:32:07,267
Just need to point her
in the right direction.

638
00:32:07,269 --> 00:32:08,769
There's been a rather
interesting development

639
00:32:08,771 --> 00:32:09,987
down here on the ground.

640
00:32:09,989 --> 00:32:11,822
Nate, are you there?

641
00:32:11,824 --> 00:32:13,156
Yeah, Mick, what's up?

642
00:32:13,158 --> 00:32:14,941
There's some kid in Mission Control

643
00:32:14,943 --> 00:32:17,611
calling himself Hank Heywood.

644
00:32:17,613 --> 00:32:19,029
That's your son.

645
00:32:19,031 --> 00:32:21,948
I fixed an essay writing
contest so Hank would win.

646
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:23,617
I should've told you earlier.

647
00:32:23,619 --> 00:32:25,002
I had to meet him.

648
00:32:25,004 --> 00:32:26,536
_

649
00:32:26,538 --> 00:32:29,039
Well, our ouidance system
failed to power back up.

650
00:32:29,041 --> 00:32:30,674
Can we enter the atmosphere without it?

651
00:32:30,676 --> 00:32:32,793
We need to figure out a re-entry angle.

652
00:32:32,795 --> 00:32:34,428
If it's too steep, the ship will burn up.

653
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:35,962
If it's too shallow, we'll bounce off

654
00:32:35,964 --> 00:32:37,964
the atmosphere and go
into orbit around the sun.

655
00:32:37,966 --> 00:32:39,933
Stein, little help here.

656
00:32:39,935 --> 00:32:42,352
I'm working as fast as I can.
But I need a supercomputer,

657
00:32:42,354 --> 00:32:45,055
which is not readily available in 1970.

658
00:32:45,057 --> 00:32:46,306
We have a supercomputer.

659
00:32:46,308 --> 00:32:47,474
Gideon is off-line.

660
00:32:47,476 --> 00:32:49,226
I'm not talking about Gideon.

661
00:32:51,313 --> 00:32:53,563
38 degrees.

662
00:32:53,565 --> 00:32:55,982
You don't even know my question.

663
00:32:55,984 --> 00:32:57,651
At what angle do we need to re-enter

664
00:32:57,653 --> 00:32:58,785
the Earth's atmosphere?

665
00:32:58,787 --> 00:33:00,737
38 degrees.

666
00:33:00,739 --> 00:33:02,906
I'm from the 22nd century;

667
00:33:02,908 --> 00:33:05,292
I've learned astro-navigation
in grade school.

668
00:33:05,294 --> 00:33:07,828
38 degrees.

669
00:33:10,999 --> 00:33:13,383
Or don't you trust me?

670
00:33:17,756 --> 00:33:19,639
The re-entry angle needs to be 38 degrees.

671
00:33:19,641 --> 00:33:21,141
How do you know?

672
00:33:21,143 --> 00:33:22,592
Thawne.

673
00:33:22,594 --> 00:33:24,511
He wants to get back to Earth.

674
00:33:24,513 --> 00:33:26,096
Same as the rest of us.

675
00:33:26,098 --> 00:33:27,814
So that he can kill us when we land.

676
00:33:27,816 --> 00:33:29,599
I'm with Amaya, grudgingly.

677
00:33:29,601 --> 00:33:30,767
I don't trust him.

678
00:33:30,769 --> 00:33:32,602
Agreed.

679
00:33:32,604 --> 00:33:33,904
Professor Stein,

680
00:33:33,906 --> 00:33:35,739
does 38 degrees sound right to you?

681
00:33:35,741 --> 00:33:37,824
It... it could be, but
without more time I...

682
00:33:37,826 --> 00:33:38,942
I can't be certain.

683
00:33:38,944 --> 00:33:40,577
We haven't gotten any time.

684
00:33:40,579 --> 00:33:42,412
Someone needs to make a decision.

685
00:33:50,255 --> 00:33:51,671
Ms. Lance.

686
00:33:51,673 --> 00:33:52,873
You're the Captain.

687
00:33:56,095 --> 00:33:58,095
Do you trust Thawne about this,

688
00:33:58,097 --> 00:34:00,046
after everything that he's done?

689
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:03,550
I do.

690
00:34:03,552 --> 00:34:06,887
Then I trust Ray.

691
00:34:06,889 --> 00:34:08,305
Let's go.

692
00:34:08,307 --> 00:34:11,608
Stein, we're a go for re-entry.

693
00:34:19,751 --> 00:34:21,535
If we don't adjust the
angle, we'll burn up.

694
00:34:21,537 --> 00:34:25,205
The thrusters are toast.

695
00:34:25,207 --> 00:34:27,240
In a few seconds we're all gonna be toast.

696
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,043
We need to blow the cargo bay door.

697
00:34:30,045 --> 00:34:31,628
- What?
- He's right.

698
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:34,381
The depressurization will
correct your angle of descent.

699
00:34:34,383 --> 00:34:35,799
The air pressure is too great.

700
00:34:35,801 --> 00:34:38,385
If anyone opens up the
door at mid-descent...

701
00:34:38,387 --> 00:34:40,220
they'll die.

702
00:34:40,222 --> 00:34:41,338
I'll go.

703
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,422
No.

704
00:34:42,424 --> 00:34:43,640
I'm Captain.

705
00:34:43,642 --> 00:34:45,642
- I'll go.
- Where is Henry?

706
00:34:48,597 --> 00:34:50,063
I'm in the cargo bay.

707
00:34:50,065 --> 00:34:51,598
It's the only way to right the ship.

708
00:34:53,101 --> 00:34:55,735
Talk me through this.

709
00:34:55,737 --> 00:34:57,571
You have to secure the inner door first.

710
00:35:01,109 --> 00:35:02,492
Check.

711
00:35:02,494 --> 00:35:04,778
Right, there should be a lever to your, uh,

712
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:05,912
to your left.

713
00:35:05,914 --> 00:35:07,581
I see it.

714
00:35:09,501 --> 00:35:10,834
Hey. Hey!

715
00:35:10,836 --> 00:35:12,702
Hey, don't! Don't do this.

716
00:35:12,704 --> 00:35:14,171
I am so sorry, Nathaniel.

717
00:35:14,173 --> 00:35:15,622
No, no, you open that door,

718
00:35:15,624 --> 00:35:17,841
the explosive decompression
will suck you out.

719
00:35:17,843 --> 00:35:19,459
If I don't, you will all die.

720
00:35:19,461 --> 00:35:21,011
I can do it. Let me do it.

721
00:35:21,013 --> 00:35:22,429
I have powers now.

722
00:35:22,431 --> 00:35:24,798
No, no. I won't let you risk your life.

723
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,266
I have fulfilled my duty,

724
00:35:26,268 --> 00:35:28,134
protecting my piece of the Spear.

725
00:35:28,136 --> 00:35:29,803
But I'm just a grunt.

726
00:35:29,805 --> 00:35:31,688
Now it's your turn.

727
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:34,224
You can figure out a
way to destroy the Spear.

728
00:35:34,226 --> 00:35:36,359
Don't let it ruin another person's life.

729
00:35:36,361 --> 00:35:37,978
Your son is at Mission Control.

730
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,779
He's there, he's waiting for you.

731
00:35:39,781 --> 00:35:40,981
Come on.

732
00:35:42,317 --> 00:35:43,533
Don't.

733
00:35:45,988 --> 00:35:49,406
Give him a message for me.

734
00:35:49,408 --> 00:35:51,541
Tell him...

735
00:35:51,543 --> 00:35:52,659
I'm sorry for leaving.

736
00:35:52,661 --> 00:35:53,994
Don't. Please don't.

737
00:35:53,996 --> 00:35:55,161
Please don't.

738
00:36:03,138 --> 00:36:04,671
It's working.

739
00:36:04,673 --> 00:36:06,389
30 degrees.

740
00:36:06,391 --> 00:36:08,675
36.

741
00:36:08,677 --> 00:36:09,976
38.

742
00:36:15,984 --> 00:36:19,319
Commander Heywood's done it.

743
00:36:19,321 --> 00:36:22,188
We're gonna make it.

744
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:23,356
Yes, we are.

745
00:36:31,867 --> 00:36:34,000
Nathaniel.

746
00:37:02,841 --> 00:37:04,241
It's a funny thing

747
00:37:04,243 --> 00:37:07,677
about Rip Hunter's anti-speedster weapons:

748
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:09,646
I invented them.

749
00:37:09,648 --> 00:37:12,048
I knew you'd escape.

750
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:13,934
You're on the run.

751
00:37:13,936 --> 00:37:16,570
Because you're a time remnant.

752
00:37:16,572 --> 00:37:19,522
You should have died when
Eddie Thawne killed himself.

753
00:37:19,524 --> 00:37:21,942
And now something's chasing you,

754
00:37:21,944 --> 00:37:24,361
trying to correct the Aberration.

755
00:37:24,363 --> 00:37:26,830
One of history's worst monsters.

756
00:37:28,417 --> 00:37:29,916
Speak of the devil.

757
00:37:29,918 --> 00:37:32,619
Well, I guess you won't have time

758
00:37:32,621 --> 00:37:35,372
to search the ship for
the Spear now, will you?

759
00:37:37,542 --> 00:37:38,959
Till we meet again, Raymond.

760
00:37:43,265 --> 00:37:44,714
Re-entry successful.

761
00:37:58,313 --> 00:37:59,946
It's pretty cool, huh?

762
00:37:59,948 --> 00:38:01,865
Got to witness history.

763
00:38:01,867 --> 00:38:04,234
You an astronaut?

764
00:38:04,236 --> 00:38:06,736
No, no, I'm...

765
00:38:06,738 --> 00:38:08,488
I wish I was that brave.

766
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:10,290
They made it home.

767
00:38:10,292 --> 00:38:12,409
Not all of them.

768
00:38:15,998 --> 00:38:17,414
They're my dad's.

769
00:38:17,416 --> 00:38:19,215
Or they were.

770
00:38:19,217 --> 00:38:21,001
He was gone before I knew him.

771
00:38:22,804 --> 00:38:24,804
I'm sure he was sorry he left.

772
00:38:24,806 --> 00:38:28,475
My dad wasn't really there for me either.

773
00:38:28,477 --> 00:38:30,176
But I knew he loved me.

774
00:38:30,178 --> 00:38:32,595
He just, um...

775
00:38:32,597 --> 00:38:34,648
just couldn't show me.

776
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:35,849
It's not fair.

777
00:38:35,851 --> 00:38:38,234
No.

778
00:38:38,236 --> 00:38:39,903
No, it's not.

779
00:38:39,905 --> 00:38:42,022
But if you can accept that,

780
00:38:42,024 --> 00:38:44,858
you'll be a better man for it.

781
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,776
You and your son.

782
00:38:54,786 --> 00:38:56,169
Drinking alone?

783
00:38:56,171 --> 00:39:00,040
Only as metaphor.

784
00:39:00,042 --> 00:39:01,791
You're in here feeling sorry for yourself?

785
00:39:01,793 --> 00:39:03,593
Oh, no, I've got more than one way

786
00:39:03,595 --> 00:39:05,462
of feeling sorry for myself, surely.

787
00:39:06,548 --> 00:39:08,798
Thanks for backing my play earlier.

788
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,635
I wasn't entirely
supportive on this mission.

789
00:39:12,637 --> 00:39:13,853
Indeed.

790
00:39:13,855 --> 00:39:15,638
Still...

791
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,975
must be hard coming back to your ship

792
00:39:18,977 --> 00:39:20,894
and finding someone else in charge.

793
00:39:20,896 --> 00:39:23,730
No. That was the easy part.

794
00:39:23,732 --> 00:39:26,733
The harder adjustment
was seeing that you are

795
00:39:26,735 --> 00:39:30,620
a much better captain than I ever was.

796
00:39:32,491 --> 00:39:35,325
So that's why you're in here
feeling sorry for yourself?

797
00:39:35,327 --> 00:39:39,496
I'm in here trying to
figure out what my place is

798
00:39:39,498 --> 00:39:42,298
if I'm not this team's captain.

799
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:45,168
So, you're saying you don't fit in.

800
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:47,220
You're an outcast.

801
00:39:47,222 --> 00:39:49,305
A misfit.

802
00:39:49,307 --> 00:39:51,174
Let's assume.

803
00:39:51,176 --> 00:39:53,927
Sounds to me like you're a Legend.

804
00:40:02,154 --> 00:40:04,487
I'm sorry, Nathaniel.

805
00:40:04,489 --> 00:40:06,489
This was my fault.

806
00:40:06,491 --> 00:40:09,109
If I hadn't of told Henry that
he shouldn't return home...

807
00:40:09,111 --> 00:40:11,027
He would've still thrown
himself off of the ship

808
00:40:11,029 --> 00:40:12,662
to save us.

809
00:40:12,664 --> 00:40:14,497
That's just who he was.

810
00:40:19,287 --> 00:40:23,540
Maybe destiny has plans for all of us.

811
00:40:23,542 --> 00:40:24,707
Not just me.

812
00:40:24,709 --> 00:40:28,294
Yeah, um, about that.

813
00:40:28,296 --> 00:40:30,213
I am, uh,

814
00:40:30,215 --> 00:40:32,348
so sorry I said those things.

815
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:35,351
No one should know too
much about their future.

816
00:40:35,353 --> 00:40:37,604
I'm not afraid of the future.

817
00:40:37,606 --> 00:40:40,390
Whatever is supposed to happen,

818
00:40:40,392 --> 00:40:42,642
it's bigger than just me.

819
00:40:42,644 --> 00:40:45,645
I know this is cheesy,

820
00:40:45,647 --> 00:40:48,448
but, um...

821
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:50,116
once you see Earth from outer space,

822
00:40:50,118 --> 00:40:51,734
you realize how small we all are.

823
00:40:51,736 --> 00:40:54,287
In a good way?

824
00:40:56,992 --> 00:40:58,992
Yeah.

825
00:40:58,994 --> 00:41:00,243
In a good way.

826
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:16,893
Gideon.

827
00:41:16,895 --> 00:41:18,845
I need you to help me with something.

828
00:41:18,847 --> 00:41:22,682
Of course, Ms. Jiwe.

829
00:41:22,684 --> 00:41:27,187
I need you to show me the
historical record on Zambesi,

830
00:41:27,189 --> 00:41:28,988
starting with my return home.

831
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:31,574
You're asking for me
to show you your future.

832
00:41:31,576 --> 00:41:35,328
I must counsel you against doing this.

833
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:38,081
Please, Gideon.

834
00:41:41,701 --> 00:41:43,542
