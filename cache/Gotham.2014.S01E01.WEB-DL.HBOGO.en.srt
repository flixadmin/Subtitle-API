1
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,880
Hey!

2
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,000
What? I think she got my wallet.
Yeah.

3
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,200
Hey!

4
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,480
Hey, stop! Stop her!

5
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,280
Oh, come on, Tom, it wasn't that bad.

6
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,280
Oh, no? Childish drivel.

7
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,920
The acting was fine
and the music was lovely.

8
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,800
What about you, Bruce?

9
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,280
Sorry, Mom, I agree with Dad.
It was kind of lame.

10
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,840
Kind of lame?
There's no such word as "kind of."

11
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,920
- It was totally lame.
- Yeah.

12
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,880
You two are so judgmental.

13
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,600
- What's up, folks?
- Stay calm, Bruce.

14
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,600
Give me your money.

15
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,360
No problem.

16
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,440
We're cooperating.

17
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,560
The necklace.

18
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,680
It's okay.

19
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,360
Easy.

20
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,720
Mom? Mom?

21
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,280
Dad? Dad!

22
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,160
No!

23
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,880
Sit down! Don't move!

24
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,520
Yeah, don't touch my face!

25
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,880
- Ease up!
- Shut up!

26
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,280
Hey, hey!

27
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,600
I need my pills. I need my pills.

28
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,120
- You wish.
- Come on, where are my pills?

29
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,000
- Back, back. Back. Come on.
- Don't move.

30
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,560
Where are my pills?

31
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,640
Hey, drop it, buddy!

32
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,800
I said, give me my pills, bitch.

33
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,560
Hold your fire!

34
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,240
Hold your fire! I got this!

35
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,400
Hold your fire.

36
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,560
Hold on. Easy, easy

37
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,640
Sir, look at me.

38
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,000
Not at them, look at me.

39
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,840
My name's Jim, Jim Gordon.
What's yours?

40
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,960
I need my pills.

41
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,160
Okay, well, everything's going
to be all right.

42
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,480
Look at me.

43
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,000
I got your pills right here.

44
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,280
You want some pills?

45
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,800
Here you go, here you go.
Here are some pills for you.

46
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,880
All right?

47
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,120
These aren't my pills.

48
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,800
- Oh, come on!
- Oh, come on!

49
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,600
Sorry, guys, didn't mean
to bark at you all like that.

50
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,400
- Got a little bit carried away.
- You're the fool.

51
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,200
Hey! Hey, hey, come on, man!
Take it easy.

52
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,880
- Come on! Hey, guys!
- Hey!

53
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,920
What the hell are you doing?
We had the drop on him.

54
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,400
Yeah, well, he's dropped, isn't he?

55
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,280
You could have gotten hurt.
Rookie mistake.

56
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,040
Next time, shoot the son of a bitch.

57
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,800
If I shoot, that sets everybody off.
Gunfire every which way.

58
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,280
Somebody takes a cop's gun,
you shoot him.

59
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,800
- That's basic.
- Yo, Bullock, Gordon, you're up.

60
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,600
Double homicide, Theater District.

61
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,560
Give me a break. Shift's nearly over.

62
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,920
Yeah, nearly.

63
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,680
Oh, the legendary Harvey Bullock.

64
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,880
- No rest for the wicked, eh?
- Tannenbaum, looking crisp.

65
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,960
This is my new partner,
James Gordon. What do we got?

66
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,640
Just got here myself.

67
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,160
Male, female, gunshot.
Their kid saw the whole thing.

68
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,280
Poor bastard
hasn't spoken a word yet.

69
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,360
My name's James Gordon.

70
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,960
I'm a detective.

71
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,840
What's your name?

72
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,800
It's okay. You don't have to talk.

73
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,200
Listen T, do me a favor.
You didn't see me, okay?

74
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,200
I see you right in front of me.
What's your problem?

75
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,960
That's Thomas and Martha Wayne.

76
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,160
I don't need that kind of hassle,

77
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,240
call Major Crimes,
they'd love to have this.

78
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,160
Yeah, but they're not here.

79
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,760
And your partner is talking
to the witness.

80
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,640
So that makes it your case.

81
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,600
Bruce.

82
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,760
My name is Bruce Wayne.

83
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,200
Can you tell me what happened,
Bruce?

84
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,560
When I was about your age,

85
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,760
a drunk driver hit our car.

86
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,440
Killed my dad.

87
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,480
I was right next to him.

88
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,400
I know how you feel right now.

89
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,480
And I promise you,

90
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,200
however dark and scary the world
might be right now...

91
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,880
there will be light.

92
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,880
There will be light, Bruce.

93
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,200
We just got out of the movies.

94
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,640
We were walking through the alley
to catch an uptown cab and...

95
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,680
a man came out of the shadows.

96
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,120
He was tall with a black mask and...

97
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,280
he had a hat and gloves...

98
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,480
and shiny shoes.

99
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,360
He took my dad's wallet
and my mom's necklace.

100
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,560
And then, he shot them
for no reason.

101
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,920
I should have done something.

102
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,080
But I was too scared.

103
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,160
There was nothing
you could have done

104
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,360
to stop what happened.

105
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,920
But there is something
you can do now.

106
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,560
You can be strong.

107
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,920
Be strong.

108
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,240
I promise you...

109
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,240
I will find the man who did this.

110
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,160
Hey, who the hell is that?

111
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,120
- James Gordon.
- Alfred Pennyworth.

112
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,520
We're going to get the guy
that did this, sir.

113
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,600
- New boy, are you?
- You could say.

114
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,920
Good luck, mate.

115
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,920
Come.

116
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,920
Don't look, head up.

117
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,200
Eyes front, don't let them
see you crying.

118
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,720
{\an5}Shouldn't we be there
when they move the victims?

119
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,800
{\an5}Why?

120
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,800
{\an5}Listen, hotshot, do me a favor.

121
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,240
Don't start talking to witnesses
until I say so.

122
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,120
- What's your problem?
- My problem, soldier boy...

123
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,800
{\an5}you just caught us a gigantic
flaming ball of crap.

124
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,040
Oh, yeah? How's that?

125
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,480
{\an5}You never heard of Thomas
and Martha Wayne?

126
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,760
{\an5}Yeah, sure. The Wayne Foundation.

127
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,000
{\an5}Yeah, two of the richest
and most powerful people in Gotham.

128
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,800
You can't begin
to imagine the pressure

129
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,240
if we don't close this thing quick.

130
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,080
So let's close it quick.

131
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,920
{\an5}Yeah, right. This is a random
street robbery, Holmes.

132
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,520
{\an5}Perp could be anyone
of 10,000 mopes out there.

133
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,000
{\an5}- Oh, crap.
- Order out.

134
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,000
{\an5}Well, well, well,
if it isn't Montoya and Allen.

135
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,120
{\an5}Major Crimes Unit.

136
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,080
{\an5}- This is my new partner, Jim Gordon.
- Nice to meet you.

137
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,080
{\an5}- Hi, Harvey.
- So you're on the Waynes, huh?

138
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,200
{\an5}- It's a terrible thing.
- Yeah.

139
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,680
{\an5}Any leads?

140
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,640
{\an5}- Just getting started.
- I'll be straight.

141
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,960
{\an5}You want us
to take it off your hands?

142
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,520
- No, no, no. This is our...
- Hold on, rook.

143
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,560
{\an5}Why you want it?

144
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,160
- You got a lead?
- No, we just need the press action.

145
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,120
{\an5}I don't know.

146
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,280
{\an5}Come on, Bullock, you know
you're scared of this case.

147
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,640
- You're damn right, I'm scared.
- So then do the right thing for once.

148
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,720
For once?

149
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,960
{\an5}Where the hell do you get
the nerve to say that to me?

150
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,880
{\an5}- You can kiss my ass.
- Okay, you be that way, brother.

151
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,680
{\an5}We're just trying
to be collegial here.

152
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,920
{\an5}You know, I almost gave it to you.

153
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,440
But you couldn't help yourselves,
could you?

154
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,280
{\an5}You had to go and be disrespectful.

155
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,520
{\an5}Okay, Harvey. Stay frosty.

156
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,400
Good luck.

157
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,640
Self-righteous do-gooding
skell huggers.

158
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,520
Always badmouthing us
like they're such freaking angels.

159
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,600
Please.

160
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,160
<i>As mayor of this great city,
I swear to you</i>

161
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,080
<i>the perpetrators of this heinous
crime will be captured</i>

162
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,720
<i>and will be punished
to the fullest extent.</i>

163
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,320
<i>I swear that to you.</i>

164
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,200
{\an5}Poor bastard.
First a crime wave, and now this.

165
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,320
You take all the people
and resources you need.

166
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,960
{\an5}- You just close this case.
- Yes, Captain.

167
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,040
Jim, will you give us a minute?

168
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,520
Captain.

169
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,440
The answer is no.

170
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,440
I don't mind,
but he just can't understand.

171
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,640
- Teach him the ropes. Yes.
- We teach?

172
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,160
Yes? What do I have to do,
change his diapers?

173
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,240
He'll get me killed.

174
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,200
All right, stop. I don't care.

175
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,000
I can't go out there with him.

176
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,040
- She said you had to keep me, huh?
- Yeah. She did.

177
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,920
She said you're a war hero.

178
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,800
And your daddy was a big shot DA
back in the olden days.

179
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,760
So I have to keep my trap shut
and do as I'm told.

180
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,480
Ouch.

181
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,720
Listen, kid, you got juice,
do me a favor, ask for a transfer.

182
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,760
Sorry, this is where the action is.
You'll get used to me.

183
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,200
Jim, you seem like a nice guy
but this is not a city

184
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,840
or a job for nice guys,
you understand?

185
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,360
- No.
- And that's your problem.

186
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,200
You're a cynic.

187
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,200
A slovenly lackadaisical cynic.

188
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,840
You're probably right.

189
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,480
Okay, soldier boy...

190
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,080
let's go roust some muggers.

191
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,720
Lackadaisical?

192
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,600
Hey!

193
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,080
How you doing?

194
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,560
Guess what this is?

195
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,480
Just tell me, Ed. I want riddles,
I'll read the funny pages.

196
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,040
It's a .45 caliber, 300 grain
cupronickel wadcutter.

197
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,400
- Came out of Thomas Wayne's chest.
- That's a six-dollar bullet.

198
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,080
Yeah. What kind of gun...?

199
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,720
Don't ask, just tell.

200
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,760
It's from a pistol not known
by our database.

201
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,440
- No prints either.
- What else you got?

202
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,320
What's nowhere but everywhere
except where something is?

203
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,400
Nothing.

204
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,840
You need professional help, Nygma.
Seriously.

205
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,960
Let's go.

206
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,280
So I'm thinking,
our man wears shiny shoes,

207
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,640
uses high-end ammo,

208
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,480
and nobody on the street knows
who he is.

209
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,600
Maybe he's not from the street.

210
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,200
Like a debonair playboy robber
does it for kicks?

211
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,320
Who would pretend
to be a street robber, huh?

212
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,080
A professional contract killer

213
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,400
or somebody with a personal grudge
against the Waynes.

214
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,480
How'd this professional know

215
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,480
the Waynes would be coming down
that alley?

216
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,560
That's a good question.

217
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,400
Essen said if we don't catch
a break in the first 48,

218
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,200
it's time to go see Fish Mooney.

219
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,440
Fish Mooney?
Works for Carmine Falcone?

220
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,920
Her, Theater District's her turf.

221
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,920
Anything happens down there,
she hears about it.

222
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,360
Tell Fish I'm here.

223
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,520
I still care for you deeply.

224
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,800
But I don't believe
that you still care for me anymore.

225
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,880
I... I care for you.

226
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,840
Then where's my money?

227
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,080
I'll get... I'll get it, I'll get it.

228
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,160
Boy!

229
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,680
- Sorry.
- If you let this hair go frizzy,

230
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,920
you will be.

231
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,960
Ma'am, Detective Bullock is here.

232
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,400
- Keep him warm.
- Yes, ma'am.

233
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,960
Hey, Oswald,

234
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,000
you want a turn?

235
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,280
- May I?
- Knock yourself out, kid.

236
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,280
Thank you, Mr. Gilzean.

237
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,720
Harvey.

238
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,000
Fish.

239
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:57,040
Where have you been?

240
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,360
Where haven't I been?

241
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,640
Who's the friend?

242
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,200
Detective James Gordon, ma'am.

243
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,160
Well, aren't you
a cool glass of milk.

244
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,880
Ma'am, was that screaming
we heard back there?

245
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,760
Yes, my boys are watching
a scary movie.

246
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,920
- Really?
- No.

247
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,480
Actually, one of my staff
has been stealing money from me.

248
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,000
- So we're beating his punk ass.
- Relax, Junior.

249
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,600
Fish gets some leeway.

250
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,680
Her staff are rough characters,
need firm handling.

251
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,720
So this isn't a social visit, then.

252
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,960
Unfortunately not,
Brass sent me by to talk to you

253
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,560
- about the Wayne murders.
- Terrible thing.

254
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,200
Listen, Junior, if you're worried,
why don't you go back there

255
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,000
and see if anyone wants
to press charges?

256
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,800
If that's okay with you, Fish.

257
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,360
My house is your house.

258
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,080
- Oswald, whoa.
- Yeah, take it easy, Penguin.

259
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,360
You know
I don't like to be called that.

260
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,360
Scary.

261
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,400
How's everybody doing?

262
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,080
- Who are you?
- James Gordon, GCPD.

263
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,440
Oh, you came with Harvey, huh?

264
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,560
Glad to know you, James.
I'm Butch Gilzean.

265
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,480
Drop the bat.

266
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:29,000
Oh, come on, now. Oswald and Raul
here were just having a little fun,

267
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,240
weren't you, boys?

268
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,680
All in fun.

269
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,760
No problem.

270
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,960
Fun.

271
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,120
You're a new guy, huh?

272
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,000
How do you like Gotham so far?

273
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,760
Well enough.

274
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,120
See you around.

275
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,040
Oh, hey.
Everything all right back there?

276
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,240
It's always good to see you,
Harvey.

277
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,760
Look at you
and your excellent suit.

278
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,160
You know, I'm so happy

279
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,160
you don't have to wear
that silly uniform anymore.

280
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,680
You told me it looked good.

281
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,560
I lied.

282
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,000
You ready to rock and roll?

283
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,720
Barbara, I'm beat.

284
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,800
And do we really have to go
to this thing?

285
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,760
No.

286
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,320
- Of course not.
- Thank you.

287
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,400
You owe me.

288
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,080
So talk to me.

289
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,320
We're getting nowhere
on the Wayne case.

290
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,240
I made a promise to Bruce Wayne
and I can't deliver.

291
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,320
But you will.

292
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,200
I don't know.

293
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,720
Maybe, I'm out of my depth.

294
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,800
Hey, I very much doubt
you're out of your depth.

295
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,440
But even if you are...

296
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,800
you know how to swim, don't you?

297
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,360
Yes, I do.

298
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,480
So swim.

299
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,920
I'll swim. You're right.

300
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,720
You hungry?

301
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,760
I'm all right. I had a few dogs.

302
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,440
When I'm Mrs. Gordon
and you're living here all the time,

303
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,720
I'm going to put you
on a proper healthy diet.

304
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,800
<i>I've got a lead.</i>

305
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,200
Meet me at Fourth and Grundy
in an hour.

306
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,400
On my way.

307
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,520
- Yeah!
- Nice.

308
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,400
- Yeah.
- All right.

309
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Hey.

310
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,120
You all right?

311
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,080
Couple of drinks. I'll be fine.

312
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,160
Bullock.

313
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,800
Fish Mooney
heard from one of her fences,

314
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,840
a guy tried to sell him an antique.

315
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,520
Four-strand pearl necklace
with gold settings,

316
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,960
one strand broken.

317
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,520
Like Martha Wayne was wearing.

318
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,720
Guy's name is Mario Pepper.

319
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,880
Career street thug,
long sheet, robbery, assault, rape,

320
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,400
extortion, drug dealing.

321
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,560
This guy?

322
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,680
Hi.

323
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,040
- What's your name?
- Ivy.

324
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,080
Ivy, is daddy home?

325
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,120
You don't want to talk to daddy.

326
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,200
Why's that, Ivy?

327
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,280
He's mean.

328
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,520
Hey, who is it?

329
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,720
Mario Pepper, we need to talk.

330
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,040
I've done nothing.

331
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,600
So it'll be a pleasant talk.

332
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,040
Where were you last Saturday night
around 9:30?

333
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,080
I was here at home with my family.

334
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,200
That's right. He was here.

335
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,920
A pearl necklace sound familiar?

336
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,360
No.

337
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:46,080
Then I guess you don't mind
we take a look around the place.

338
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,880
You need a warrant.

339
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,200
You're a felon on parole.
All we need is reasonable cause.

340
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,840
Stop! Stop or I'll shoot!

341
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,240
Out of the way!

342
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,640
Thanks.

343
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,000
What kind of guy are we dealing with?

344
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,840
Probably? I had to.

345
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,840
We got him!

346
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,840
We got him.

347
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,440
Mario Pepper was framed
by Fish Mooney and the cops.

348
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,000
I saw Miss Mooney
with Martha Wayne's necklace.

349
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,400
She was discussing how to get it
into Pepper's home,

350
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,280
inside a bag of drugs.

351
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,920
This was shortly after she met

352
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,760
with Detectives Bullock and Gordon
from the homicide squad.

353
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,520
Mooney works
for Carmine Falcone's mob.

354
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,920
You saying Falcone
had the Waynes killed?

355
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,840
I'm just telling you what I saw.

356
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,080
Then why snitch on your own boss?

357
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,360
I confess...

358
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,440
that poor orphan boy
pricked my conscience.

359
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,600
No.

360
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,160
You want to push Fish out, huh?

361
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,680
That's beside the point.

362
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,160
I've done my civic duty.

363
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,160
Good day to you both.

364
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,160
You kept your promise.

365
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,640
Thank you.

366
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,280
I'm sorry you didn't see a trial.

367
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,880
That's okay.

368
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,040
Renee, long time.

369
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,560
Yeah.

370
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,640
Sorry to drop by unexpected
like this.

371
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,240
How have you been?

372
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,600
I'm good.

373
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,360
- You?
- All good.

374
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,160
You're running an art gallery now,
right?

375
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,480
- Yeah.
- That's so cool.

376
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,240
And I'm engaged.

377
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,840
That's why I'm here.

378
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,440
The GCPD framed Mario Pepper
for the murder of the Waynes.

379
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,920
What?

380
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,120
They framed
and killed an innocent man.

381
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,240
And you're here to tell me
that James was in on this.

382
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,880
- Yes.
- And what's your proof?

383
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,320
I can't tell you, but it's the truth.

384
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,520
James Gordon is not a good guy.

385
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,440
You deserve better.

386
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,120
James Gordon is the most honest man
I've ever met.

387
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,480
He's not capable of doing that.

388
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,880
You sure you know
what he's capable of?

389
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,520
Yes, thank you, I know him.

390
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,960
Does he know you?

391
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,000
Don't.

392
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,320
Like I know you?

393
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,640
Here you are.

394
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,800
Barbara...

395
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,600
what's wrong?

396
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,880
Did you frame Mario Pepper?

397
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,560
- No.
- I knew it.

398
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,720
Who told you that Pepper
was framed?

399
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,920
It doesn't matter,
as long as it's not true.

400
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,600
It's not. Who told you it was?

401
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,840
Nobody.

402
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,280
Bee, I know when you're lying.

403
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,960
Montoya!

404
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,840
What's your evidence
that Pepper was framed?

405
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,800
I was wrong to reveal
that information to Barbara.

406
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,040
- We're old friends.
- I asked what evidence you have.

407
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,160
You'll see the evidence

408
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,920
when we get you
and your crooked friends

409
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,200
into a courtroom.

410
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,800
We're working on it.

411
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,920
Save your energy.

412
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,960
If Pepper was framed,
I'll find out.

413
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,320
Hey, you got a problem here,
Gordon?

414
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:02,000
And then, you and you
just need to stay out of my way.

415
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,720
- Mrs. Pepper.
- Go away.

416
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,200
Ma'am, if your husband
was innocent,

417
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,680
you need to talk to me.

418
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,440
If your husband
didn't kill the Waynes,

419
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,440
how did he come to have
Martha Wayne's necklace?

420
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,800
You bastards planted it on him.

421
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,080
Bastards.

422
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,600
Alice...

423
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,680
how would the police
have the necklace?

424
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,120
- We didn't kill the Waynes.
- So you say.

425
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,960
God knows my husband had his demons

426
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,520
but he never killed nobody.

427
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,720
Can I see his shoes?

428
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,200
Shoes?

429
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,080
This is all of them?

430
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,120
Damn.

431
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,680
Framed.

432
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,200
How you figure? You were there.
We framed him?

433
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,840
Somebody could've planted
the necklace on Pepper

434
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,920
for us to find.

435
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,520
Fish Mooney could've set
the whole thing up.

436
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,680
- Why?
- To cover up for the real killer.

437
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,680
Mooney works for Falcone.

438
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,600
Maybe Falcone wanted
the Waynes killed.

439
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,880
Wait, wait, wait.

440
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,560
Why would such a nutty idea
even enter your head?

441
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,840
Montoya from MCU.

442
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,520
That pill-head looney-bird?
What's her proof?

443
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,080
Wouldn't tell me. Didn't trust me.

444
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,400
She doesn't have any.

445
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,920
If they did, they would have used it.

446
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,480
Pepper didn't wear shiny shoes.

447
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,480
He didn't own any shiny shoes.

448
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,960
Shiny shoes. Mother of God.

449
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,560
Shiny shoes,
just suppose for a moment,

450
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,040
just suppose Pepper was innocent.

451
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,160
I killed him.

452
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,480
- We killed him.
- We killed him.

453
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,960
We'd lose our jobs at the very least.

454
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,760
The case is closed.

455
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,720
Forget about it.

456
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,040
Even if the real killers
are still out there?

457
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,200
Yes.

458
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,000
This is very perilous stuff
you're messing with.

459
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:06,280
Listen to me for once, Jim.
Forget about it.

460
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,200
Detective Gordon.

461
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,360
- Tell Mooney I'm here.
- May I ask why?

462
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,440
No.

463
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,320
No. Yes.

464
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,000
James Gordon, how nice.

465
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,520
The day I met you,
when I was out back with your boys,

466
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,280
what did you and Harvey talk about?

467
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,680
Shouldn't you ask Harvey?

468
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,840
He's your partner.

469
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,480
I'm afraid he might lie.

470
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,440
He might.

471
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,240
And you think
I'll tell you the truth?

472
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,880
You just did.

473
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,360
James, wait.

474
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,280
You have a little danger
in your eye.

475
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,600
I want to know what you plan
to do with that?

476
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,400
You'll have to wait and see.

477
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,800
I hate surprises.

478
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,080
Detective Bullock?

479
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,240
Miss Kean.

480
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,280
James went for a walk last night
and he never came back.

481
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,720
You heard from him?
I'm really worried about him.

482
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,240
He's on a stake-out.

483
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,720
Yeah, his phone probably
ran out of juice, is all.

484
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,760
Right, well, that's a relief.

485
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,120
- Thank you.
- No problem.

486
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,400
Wait! Wait, wait.

487
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,200
Shut up.

488
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,640
Hey, what are you doing?

489
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,080
Put it over here,
you'll get a better angle.

490
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,360
What? You're a director now?

491
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,120
Don't get fresh. I'm just saying.

492
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,080
Hey, Butch!

493
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,080
Harvey.

494
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,360
Who told you we'd be here?

495
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,760
Everybody knows this is where
you take your problems.

496
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,800
That's my partner you got there.

497
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,440
Ex-partner.

498
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,960
Let me talk to Fish.

499
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,560
I'm not afraid of death,
so much as I am of dying.

500
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:59,840
I want to die how my father died,
peacefully in his sleep,

501
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:03,200
not like his screaming,
terrified passengers.

502
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,560
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

503
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,000
Bullock showed up at the plant.

504
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,640
- Wants to talk to you.
<i>- Put him on.</i>

505
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,880
Give me a moment, kid.
You're doing good.

506
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,160
- <i>Fish?</i>
- Speaking.

507
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,560
Don't be like that.
Listen, you got to let my boy go.

508
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:27,800
- <i>How long we've been friends?</i>
- For a long time. Until today.

509
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,680
I did a big favor for you
and your little pals

510
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,080
and now it's all about to blow up
in my face

511
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,680
on account of your stupidity.

512
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,320
Look, the kid's
not your problem here.

513
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,200
He was hipped to the frame
by Major Crimes,

514
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,560
they're going to be coming
after you.

515
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,600
How did they get onto me?

516
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,200
The usual way, I guess.

517
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,960
Somebody talked.

518
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,080
- <i>Not one of my people.</i>
- That's what everybody says.

519
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,360
- True.
- Listen, you got to let my boy go.

520
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,280
You kill my partner,
I got to come after you.

521
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,520
<i>I don't want to do it,
but how am I going to look?</i>

522
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,440
You kill my partner,
I don't make a move?

523
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,120
All right.

524
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,560
But you have to promise me
that you'll keep him under control.

525
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,720
- I promise.
- <i>Cool</i>.

526
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,120
Put Butch on, please.

527
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,960
Yeah, Boss?

528
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,000
That son of a bitch
just threatened me.

529
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,360
You hang him up with his partner.

530
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,040
I got it.

531
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:27,320
- Hey, how you doing?
- I'm good. We're going home.

532
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,400
Yeah?

533
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,880
Gentlemen, I'm just glad everything
could work out...

534
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,520
Cops.

535
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,920
Bless your heart.

536
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,360
Would you be a sweet boy
and rub my feet?

537
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,400
Give me a moment, darling.
I haven't forgotten about you.

538
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,440
I like you. You're funny.

539
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,880
Now, this amateur nonsense
is a good sign.

540
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,800
There used to be some discipline.

541
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,160
Falcone is getting old and soft.

542
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,280
It's time.

543
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,560
Somebody has to take over,
it might as well be me.

544
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,240
Yes, it might as well.

545
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:13,640
And you? You're like a son to me.
You know that, Oswald?

546
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,240
I feel that way also.

547
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,000
Which is what I don't understand.

548
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,440
After all I've done for you

549
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,920
and right when I'm on the verge
of great things,

550
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,480
you betray me.

551
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,560
Why would you betray your mother?

552
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,120
I don't know what you mean.

553
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,480
It was you.

554
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,600
You snitched to the MCU.

555
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,120
You want to know how I know?

556
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:43,240
Because only you saw me
with the pearls, no one else.

557
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,080
It was Gilzean.

558
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,280
He's the snitch.

559
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,320
No.

560
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,080
- Gilzean is loyal.
- So am I.

561
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:01,280
I would open a vein right here,
now, if you ask me to.

562
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,480
Go on, then.

563
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,400
Open one.

564
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:16,040
I... I was speaking poetically.

565
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,720
Prove it.

566
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:23,320
Prove your loyalty,
my little Penguin.

567
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,040
Please, Miss Mooney.

568
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,600
Please, don't.

569
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:38,160
You broke my heart!

570
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,000
Are you rolling?

571
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,320
- How you doing?
- Are you rolling now?

572
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,600
Hold on.

573
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,760
Been better.

574
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,560
Thanks for trying to help.

575
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,040
Wish I hadn't.

576
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,120
Did you just slap my hand?

577
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,640
- Hey, Butch!
- Yeah? Save your breath.

578
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,920
Look, if it was up to me,
you'd get a bullet in the head

579
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,040
and a decent funeral, but...

580
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,040
Fish has her ways.

581
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,080
Yo, Franky! Show time.

582
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,080
Don Falcone.

583
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,920
Forgive me, young man,
I forgot what your name is.

584
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,480
Or perhaps I never knew it.

585
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,200
- Gilzean, sir.
- Gilzean.

586
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,040
Tell Miss Mooney
she's too impetuous.

587
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,360
If she wants to kill policemen,

588
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,480
she has to ask permission.

589
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,560
Yes, sir.

590
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,040
There are rules.

591
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,440
Cut them down.

592
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,080
That's right, there are rules.

593
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,480
It's good to meet you at last,
James.

594
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,960
I knew your father very well.

595
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,840
The best DA this city ever had.

596
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,720
He and I understood each other.

597
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,480
There was respect. Friendship, even.

598
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,040
Friendship?

599
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,360
Trust me...

600
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,240
that's the only reason
you're alive now.

601
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,640
Blood doesn't lie.

602
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,240
I know that when you leave here,
you'll do the right thing.

603
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,400
I will.

604
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,320
I'll tell what I know.

605
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,280
Which is what?

606
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,120
I know that you own
the police department,

607
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,520
probably the Mayor too.

608
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,840
And I was pretty sure
that you had the Waynes killed.

609
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,920
But if you did, you wouldn't risk
letting me live, would you?

610
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:01,040
Then again, how did Fish Mooney
come to have Martha Wayne's necklace?

611
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,560
- A replica?
- Yes.

612
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,560
But if you didn't have them killed,
why frame Mario Pepper?

613
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,360
Or are you covering up
for somebody else?

614
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,880
Who knows who killed the Waynes?

615
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,440
Some low-life.

616
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,080
We needed a culprit
before the funeral.

617
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,600
Pepper was sacrificed
so that the people of Gotham

618
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,640
would see swift justice done.

619
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,520
So they can feel safe and secure.

620
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,040
- And that matters so much to you.
- Of course.

621
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,400
I'm a businessman.

622
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,600
You can't have organized crime
without law and order.

623
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,320
I love this city,
and I see it going to hell.

624
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,000
But I won't let it fall apart
without a fight.

625
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,680
You make a life of crime
sound very noble.

626
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,800
You have a hard head, James,
just like your father.

627
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,560
Don't be self-righteous.
Don't be arrogant.

628
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,640
You want me to keep quiet
about all this.

629
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,600
Gotham is on a knife edge.

630
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:00,000
What do you suppose
bringing down city hall

631
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,600
and the police force will do,
even if you could?

632
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,400
Would it make things better?

633
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,840
Into the wolf's mouth.

634
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,080
- Lookit, Jim.
- I'm listening.

635
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,440
I wasn't being honest with you.

636
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,280
But you weren't ready
for the truth.

637
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,760
You didn't tell me
because you were ashamed.

638
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,080
Why are we stopping here?

639
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,480
- Please, please, I beg of you.
- Shut up!

640
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,720
This is the fool that snitched
to Montoya and Allen.

641
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,760
Falcone wants you to walk him
to the end of that pier

642
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,400
and put a bullet in his head.

643
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,280
Then everybody knows
you're with the program.

644
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,000
And if I don't?

645
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:11,120
Then I'm supposed to take you out
and him too.

646
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,920
And here's the thing, Jim,
I like you.

647
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,600
I might not have the stomach
to do it, but I'll try.

648
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:21,920
Because if I don't, someone
will get to you quick enough.

649
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,920
Then they're going to get to me
and probably Barbara as well.

650
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,560
Who knows what you told her.

651
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,440
- I told her nothing.
- You think Falcone cares?

652
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,240
Come on, you've killed people before.

653
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,960
- That was war!
- This is war!

654
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,240
We're at war
with scumbags like him.

655
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,920
Sometimes in a war, you got to do
a bad thing to do good, right?

656
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,280
So do you do this bad thing
or do you die

657
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,880
and maybe your girl dies?

658
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,080
I might be lackadaisical.

659
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,560
But that's not a tough call.

660
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,760
Walk.

661
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,080
Please, Mr. Gordon.

662
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,280
Just let me live.
I'll do whatever you say.

663
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,640
I'll be your slave for life.

664
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:34,680
Listen to me, there's a war coming,
a terrible war.

665
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:37,800
Falcone is losing his grip
and his rivals are hungry.

666
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,360
There will be chaos,

667
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,720
rivers of blood in the streets,
I know it.

668
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,600
I can see it coming.

669
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,280
I'm clever that way.

670
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,680
And I can help you.

671
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,680
- I can be a spy.
- Shut up!

672
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,360
Turn around.

673
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,760
For God's sake, have mercy.

674
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,200
Don't ever come back to Gotham.

675
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,800
Attaboy.

676
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,440
Oh, my God, James.

677
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,000
I've been so worried.

678
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,600
What happened to you?

679
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:24,640
Oi, Master Bruce!
Get your bloody ass down off there!

680
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,280
How many times have I told you?

681
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,480
Why were you up on the roof?

682
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,000
I'm learning to conquer fear.

683
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,720
Fear doesn't need conquering.

684
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,080
Fear tells you where the edge is.

685
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,200
Fear is a good thing.

686
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,000
And you think
I haven't told him that, do you?

687
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,880
You came here for a reason,
I imagine.

688
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,600
Yes.

689
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,680
Mario Pepper
didn't kill your parents.

690
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,600
He was framed
by the police department

691
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,440
and the mob working together.

692
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:02,520
We killed an innocent man.

693
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,640
All right. So who did it then?

694
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,200
I don't know.

695
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:11,080
I see. Sterling work there then,
mate?

696
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:14,320
Yes, I'm sorry.

697
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,280
Don't be.

698
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,640
I'm glad he's still alive.

699
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,640
I want to see him again.

700
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:31,160
I'm asking you
to give me a second chance.

701
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:34,760
I'm going to find out
who killed your parents and why.

702
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,720
And I'm going to clean up
the damn police department if I can.

703
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,520
But I can only do that
from the inside.

704
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,720
So I'm asking you to stay silent...

705
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,040
about what I've told you.

706
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:50,160
Your call.

707
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:53,280
All right, well, that's sort
of convenient, isn't it...?

708
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,360
Alfred!

709
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:15,720
Thank you.
