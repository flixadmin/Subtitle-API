1
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:37,490
I've taken your castle.

2
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,661
-Theon?
-It's Prince Theon now.

3
00:02:42,161 --> 00:02:43,955
Get up. You have to get dressed.

4
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:49,669
I've taken Winterfell. I took it.
I am occupying it.

5
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,881
I sent men over the walls
with grappling claws and ropes.

6
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:55,675
-Why?
-To take the castle.

7
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:59,512
-You went with Robb.
-And he sent me back to Pyke.

8
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:03,600
I'm a Greyjoy. I can't fight for Robb
and my father both.

9
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,896
-Where's Hodor?
-I don't know.

10
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:09,772
Find the halfwit.

11
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,776
My men are bringing your people together
in the courtyard.

12
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,194
Why?

13
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:18,907
So you and I can go down and tell them
how you've yielded Winterfell to me.

14
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:19,908
I won't.

15
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:25,163
-Yes, you will.
-I won't. I'll never yield.

16
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:26,789
We'll fight you and throw you out.

17
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:36,299
The castle is mine,
but these people are still yours.

18
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:40,428
You'll yield to keep them safe,
to keep them alive.

19
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,765
That's what a good lord would do.

20
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,063
Think carefully about
what you want to say.

21
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,903
Theon. Did you hate us the whole time?

22
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,205
I've yielded Winterfell to Theon.

23
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,500
Louder. Say "Prince Theon."

24
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,878
I've yielded Winterfell to Prince Theon.

25
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:15,922
You all know me.

26
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:18,591
Aye, we know you
for a steaming sack of shit!

27
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,093
Farlen, you be silent.

28
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:25,056
Listen to your little lord, Farlen.
He has more sense than you do.

29
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,266
All of you should do as he commands.

30
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,728
My father has donned the ancient crown
of salt and rock

31
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:33,856
and declared himself
King of the Iron Islands.

32
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,568
He claims the North as well
by right of conquest.

33
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,363
-You are all his subjects.
-Bugger that.

34
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:42,073
I serve the Starks.

35
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,534
If you think you can hold the North
with this--

36
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:49,205
If you serve me as loyally
as you served Ned Stark,

37
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,166
-I will be as good to you as he ever was.
-Steady.

38
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,377
Betray me, and you will wish you hadn't.

39
00:04:56,587 --> 00:05:01,634
Maester Luwin, send a raven to Pyke,
informing my father of my victory here.

40
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,470
And one to Deepwood Motte, to my sister.

41
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:08,850
Inform her that she's to bring
500 men to Winterfell.

42
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:14,647
You are a maester of the Citadel,

43
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:18,151
sworn to serve the lord of Winterfell,
are you not?

44
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,777
I am.

45
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,281
I am the Lord of Winterfell,
as Bran just informed you.

46
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:26,576
Send the ravens.

47
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,288
My lord.

48
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:34,000
Milord Greyjoy.

49
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:38,755
I see you've finally learned
how to address your betters.

50
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,758
What do you want?

51
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:45,470
I was brought here a captive.
You were here the day I was taken.

52
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:48,765
I'm the one who took you. What of it?

53
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:51,726
Let me serve you.

54
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:57,273
Serve me, how? I need fighters,
not kitchen sluts.

55
00:05:57,356 --> 00:05:59,400
It was Robb Stark who put me
in the kitchens.

56
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:05,531
-Put a spear in my hand again.
-So you can bury it in my neck?

57
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,284
Do you take me for a fool? Get up.

58
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,661
Step aside.

59
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:17,085
-Why?
-It's your dream, little lord.

60
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,129
The ocean has come to swallow this place.

61
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:22,465
I ain't letting it drown me.

62
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:25,093
You will go about your tasks as usual,
and in a few days’ time--

63
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,135
Greyjoy!

64
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:36,646
We caught this one on his way back
from Torrhen's Square.

65
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:39,440
He took out two of ours
before I got his sword.

66
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:43,569
Ser Rodrik. It grieves me
that we meet as foes.

67
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:47,115
It grieves me you've less honor
than a back-alley whore.

68
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:49,867
You were raised here, under this roof.

69
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:53,454
-These people are your people.
-They are not my people.

70
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,331
King Robb thought of you as a brother.

71
00:06:56,958 --> 00:07:01,879
My brothers are dead. They died fighting
Stark men. Men like you.

72
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,423
Aye, they died fighting a war
your father started.

73
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,510
Lord Stark raised you
among his own sons.

74
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,596
Among them, but not one of them.
I was his hostage.

75
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:13,933
-Taken from my home.
-If he were alive to see this--

76
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:17,728
He's not. He's dead.
The Seven Kingdoms are at war.

77
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,064
And Winterfell is mine.

78
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:24,277
I should have put a sword in your belly
instead of in your hand.

79
00:07:25,444 --> 00:07:29,365
You've served this house faithfully,
old man, but keep talking and I'll--

80
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,954
-Take him to the cells! Lock him up for--
-My prince…

81
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:40,168
-You cannot let that stand. He must pay.
-I'll lock him in a cell

82
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,586
-until he rots like--
-No.

83
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,213
He has to pay the iron price.

84
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,549
They'll never respect you while he lives.

85
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,946
Ser Rodrik, I sentence you to death.

86
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,699
No! You said no harm would come to them
if I yielded!

87
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:16,370
-The old man couldn't keep his mouth shut.
-I urge you not to make a hasty decision.

88
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:21,167
He disrespected me in front of my men.
That was his decision, not mine.

89
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:25,379
He's worth more to you alive than dead.
The Starks will pay.

90
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:31,219
Please, Theon, think what you do.

91
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:44,857
You'll address me as Prince Theon,
or you'll be next.

92
00:08:46,525 --> 00:08:47,443
Come.

93
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:52,740
-No!
-No! Theon!

94
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:57,828
Ser Rodrik!

95
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,791
He who passes the sentence
should swing the sword.

96
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,417
-I'm begging you.
-Coward.

97
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,714
Stop! Stop right now!

98
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,385
You don't give commands anymore,
little lord.

99
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:14,553
-Please! Stop him!
-Hush now, child.

100
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:16,931
I'm off to see your father.

101
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,769
You said no harm would come!

102
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:25,398
You said no harm
would come to him! Please!

103
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:27,024
Any last words, old man?

104
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:33,281
Gods help you, Theon Greyjoy.
Now you are truly lost.

105
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,784
-Theon, please don't!
-Do something!

106
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:40,371
-I'll do anything, please!
-No, please stop it!

107
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,071
Ghost, stay with us!

108
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:17,825
-Ghost!
-There goes your pet.

109
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:21,871
-He's not a pet.
-No, you're right. He's not.

110
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:26,459
You can't tame a wild thing.
You can't trust a wild thing.

111
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,919
-Ghost is different.
-So you think.

112
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:33,841
Wild creatures have their own rules,
their own reasons.

113
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,718
And you'll never know them.

114
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:42,224
Now, the wildlings we're looking for sleep
during the day and hunt at night.

115
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,480
I thought you said you couldn't know
wild things.

116
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:48,689
I said you can't.

117
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,234
They find a nice cave to hide in
while the sun's up,

118
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,487
then do their killing when it's dark.

119
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,448
-We could do the same.
-No, we couldn't.

120
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:02,119
This is their country. They know
where to walk, where not to walk.

121
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,456
I've lost good men who fell
into a crevasse they didn't see

122
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:06,499
till they were in it.

123
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:10,169
Father always said I am of the North.

124
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:15,132
-He wasn't joking.
-Look around, boy.

125
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,968
This look like home to you?

126
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,097
You start thinking you know this place,
it will kill you.

127
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:24,266
You understand me?

128
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:26,811
No, you don't.

129
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,524
-We're at war.
-We've always been at war.

130
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,692
And it's never going to end,
'cause we're not fighting an enemy.

131
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,654
We're fighting the North,
and it's not going anywhere.

132
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,074
The Watch has given you a great gift.

133
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:44,203
And you only have one thing
to give in return. Your life.

134
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:47,581
-I'll gladly give my life.
-I don't want you to be glad about it.

135
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:52,044
I want you to curse and fight
until your heart's done pumping.

136
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:58,300
And know this, boy. Your death will
be a gift for them south of the Wall.

137
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,761
They'll never know what you've done.

138
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,098
They'll never know how you died.
They won't even know your damn name.

139
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,142
But they'll be alive,

140
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:10,020
because some nameless bastard north
of the Wall gave his life for theirs.

141
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,358
Now, do you understand me?

142
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,277
I do.

143
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,571
You're even dumber than you look.

144
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,909
It's just words, boy, to keep us
a little warmer in the night.

145
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,745
Make us feel like we got a purpose.

146
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,125
Come on. We've got to find
these goat-fuckers

147
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,085
before night falls and they find us.

148
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,892
-Can you read?
-My lord?

149
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:50,853
Can you read?

150
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,318
This letter detailing our
infantry movements

151
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,862
was meant for Lord Damon
of House Marbrand.

152
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:03,574
It was sent to Lord Marlin
of House Dormund.

153
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,160
-My apologies, my lord, I must've…
-Girl?

154
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:09,205
Fetch meThe History of the Greater
and the Lesser Houses.

155
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,289
It's the one on the s…

156
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,671
My cupbearer can read better than you.

157
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:30,392
To whom does House Dormund owe allegiance?

158
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:36,982
-My lord, I…
-To the Starks of Winterfell!

159
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,195
Who have twenty thousand men and my son!

160
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,658
I judged you might be good
for something more

161
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:49,828
than brutalizing peasants.
I see I overestimated you.

162
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,458
If you ever put my son's life
at risk again, I'll…

163
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:57,711
Leave us.

164
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,263
Put the book away, girl.

165
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:17,731
Maybe you should devise our next
battle plan while you're about it.

166
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,072
Lord Petyr Baelish.

167
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:28,367
Give us the room.

168
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,168
Clear all this.

169
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,758
-Lord Tywin.
-Baelish.

170
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,560
-Wine?
-Thank you.

171
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:00,232
What news from the capital?

172
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:03,402
I travelled here directly
from Renly Baratheon's camp.

173
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:07,865
The late "King" Renly.
Rather a short reign.

174
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,368
-Murdered by a woman, I hear.
-So they say.

175
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:19,209
There has been talk of… other forces
at work. Dark forces.

176
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,046
Here.

177
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:28,677
Men love to blame demons
when their grand plans unravel.

178
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:36,185
It is my belief that a moment of chaos
affords opportunities lost soon after.

179
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:39,063
You say that as if you were
the first man alive to think it.

180
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:41,899
Yes, a crisis is an opportunity.

181
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:44,401
What other brilliant insights
have you brought me today?

182
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:48,739
After the Lannisters and the Starks,
the Tyrells command the largest host.

183
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,824
Their lands are the most fertile
in the Seven Kingdoms,

184
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:54,870
-feeding horses and soldiers.
-Yes, yes, yes.

185
00:15:54,953 --> 00:15:58,207
The Tyrells have not yet declared
for any of the surviving kings.

186
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:04,963
Loras wants revenge. He blames Stannis
for Renly's death. And Margaery…

187
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:09,176
-Wants to be queen.
-Yes, she does.

188
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,348
House Tyrell rebelled
against the Iron Throne,

189
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,059
against my grandson.

190
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,268
They did.

191
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:22,272
And perhaps that treason should
be punished. One day.

192
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:26,276
After Stannis and Robb Stark are defeated.

193
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,073
More wine for Lord Baelish.

194
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:40,457
If you will allow me to represent
your family's interests,

195
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,419
I believe that an advantageous agreement--

196
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,963
The Tyrell host has returned
to Highgarden?

197
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:47,005
They have.

198
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,468
-Pardon, my lord.
-It's only wine.

199
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:57,433
-You would ride there yourself?
-Tonight, with your leave.

200
00:16:58,016 --> 00:17:00,728
I'll have an answer by nightfall.
That will be all, girl.

201
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,318
What else?

202
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:12,698
On your son Tyrion's directive,
I met with Catelyn Stark.

203
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:14,658
Why?

204
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:19,079
He had an interesting proposal for her.
Concerning her daughters.

205
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,549
-A girl.
-A wildling.

206
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:18,889
-We could question her.
-You could. She won't answer.

207
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:22,476
I've known a wildling to bite off
his tongue instead of talking.

208
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,647
-What's your name?
-Ygritte.

209
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:28,982
She was reaching for this axe
when you got to her.

210
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,361
Give her half a chance,
she'll bury it in your face.

211
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,405
I gave you my name.

212
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:38,659
I'm Jon Snow.

213
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:50,587
-You ought to burn them you killed.
-We'd need a big fire for that.

214
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:57,386
Tell me, Ygritte, why do you want us
to build a big fire?

215
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,222
You have some more friends in the area?

216
00:19:01,139 --> 00:19:04,059
Burn them. Or maybe you'll need
those swords again.

217
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,728
Our boy here's already killed
one dead man.

218
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,146
He can do it again if he has to.

219
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,149
What waits beyond the pass?

220
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,652
-The free folk.
-How many?

221
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,447
Hundreds and thousands.

222
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,075
More than you've ever seen, crow.

223
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,578
Why come to the mountains?

224
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,373
What's in the Frostfangs
your king could want?

225
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:36,300
Do you mean to march on the Wall?

226
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,474
Do you know who I am, girl?

227
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:46,852
Qhorin Halfhand.

228
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:51,690
Tell me true… if your people
captured me,

229
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,984
would they take me prisoner?

230
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,946
They'd take your head off your shoulders
if they was feeling kind.

231
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:00,908
If not, they'd kill you slow.

232
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:05,621
We have no food for her.

233
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,290
We can't spare a man to watch her.

234
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:11,793
We can't let her go, she'll bring
Mance Rayder's army down on us.

235
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,880
-It needs to be done. Want me to do it?
-No.

236
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:18,467
No, I'll do it.

237
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:23,764
Come, brothers. Leave him to it.

238
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:27,684
We'll meet you at the top.
Don't take too long.

239
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,603
We're deep in their country now.

240
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,535
You never killed a woman before,
did you?

241
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,038
You don't need to do it.

242
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:51,333
Mance would take you, I know he would.

243
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:55,921
There's secret ways. The crows
would never catch us.

244
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:59,424
I'm as much a crow as they are.

245
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:15,232
Will you burn me… after?

246
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:17,859
Can't.

247
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,862
Someone might see the smoke.

248
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:30,664
Strike hard and true, Jon Snow.

249
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,709
Or I'll come back and haunt you.

250
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:39,214
That's cold.

251
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:45,887
Go on, be quick about it.

252
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:55,147
Do it.

253
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,402
Bastard. Do it!

254
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:19,397
You can't do it. We both know it.

255
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:29,157
The sun's going down, Jon Snow.
And your friends are nowhere close.

256
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,076
I'll find them.

257
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:36,039
Call for them. Go on. Call loudly.

258
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:47,050
May the Seven guide the princess
on her journey.

259
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:51,888
May the Mother give her health.
May the Crone give her wisdom.

260
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:55,016
May the Warrior give her courage.

261
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:00,021
May the Smith grant her strength…

262
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:01,898
One day I pray you love someone.

263
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,026
I pray you love her so much,

264
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:08,196
when you close your eyes,
you see her face.

265
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:11,783
I want that for you.

266
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,954
I want you to know what it's like
to love someone,

267
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:18,790
to truly love someone…

268
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,335
before I take her from you.

269
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:30,760
May her faith in you remain strong
to keep and protect her

270
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,304
as she makes her way.

271
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:44,065
You sound like a little cat, mewling
for his mother. Princes don't cry.

272
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:47,777
-I saw you cry.
-Did you say something, my lady?

273
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:50,447
My little brother cried
when I left Winterfell.

274
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:53,783
-So?
-It seems a normal thing.

275
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,953
-Is your little brother a prince?
-No.

276
00:24:58,455 --> 00:24:59,789
Not really relevant, then, is it?

277
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:05,253
Come, dog.

278
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:17,557
Hail Joffrey! Hail to the king!

279
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,687
Seven blessings on you, Your Grace.

280
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,314
Murderer! Bastard!

281
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:25,815
All hail the king!

282
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,571
Please, Your Grace. We're hungry.

283
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:37,535
-Freak!
-Get the prince back to the Keep, now.

284
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,162
Yes, my lord. Come, quickly.

285
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:42,123
Please, Your Grace, we have no food!

286
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,084
Bread, Your Grace. Please.

287
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:48,880
Who threw that?

288
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:53,593
I want the man who threw that!
Find who did that and bring him to me!

289
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,136
-Hold on!
-Stay back!

290
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,430
Just kill them! Kill them all!

291
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:05,397
-Move!
-Fall back!

292
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:07,315
Tear him to pieces!

293
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:10,151
What are you doing?
I want these people executed!

294
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,695
And they want the same for you.

295
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,349
Where's Sansa?

296
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,814
-Come on!
-Push on!

297
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,320
Protect the King!

298
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:55,030
Get back!

299
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:13,923
Keep him safe!

300
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:17,927
Watch out. Hold them back!

301
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,554
Get in. Come on.

302
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:27,270
Hey!

303
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:32,233
Traitors! I'll have all their heads!

304
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:36,279
-You blind, bloody fool.
-You can't insult me.

305
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:39,532
We've had vicious kings
and we've had idiot kings,

306
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:42,160
but I don't know if we've ever been cursed
with a vicious idiot for a king.

307
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:43,828
-You can't--
-I can. I am.

308
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:45,330
They attacked me!

309
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:48,875
They threw a cow pie at you,
so you decide to kill them all?

310
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:50,752
They're starving, you fool!

311
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:54,589
-All because of a war you started.
-You're talking to a king!

312
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:58,635
And now I've struck a king.
Did my hand fall from my wrist?

313
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:03,056
-Where is the Stark girl?
-Let them have her!

314
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:06,267
If she dies, you'll never get
your Uncle Jaime back.

315
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:09,020
You owe him quite a bit, you know.

316
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:19,531
Where are you going?

317
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:23,910
You ever been fucked, little girl?

318
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:26,287
Come here!

319
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:30,792
-Take some men and go find the Stark girl.
-I take my orders from the king.

320
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:33,586
This way!

321
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:36,214
No!

322
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,303
Please!

323
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,076
Please!

324
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:10,915
You're all right now, little bird.
You're all right.

325
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:33,897
Are you hurt, my lady?

326
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,733
The little bird's bleeding.
Someone take her back to her cage.

327
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,360
-See to that cut.
-Well done, Clegane.

328
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:42,530
I didn't do it for you.

329
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:46,451
He shouldn't make me wait.

330
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:50,705
The Spice King is the
second-wealthiest man in Qarth.

331
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:52,874
He makes everyone wait.

332
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,920
Of course, you could have avoided
this embarrassment

333
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:59,547
if you married the wealthiest man
in Qarth.

334
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:03,301
-I already have a husband.
-Khal Drogo is gone, Khaleesi.

335
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:09,807
You are far too young to be a widow
forever, and… far too beautiful.

336
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:13,937
And you are far too smart to think
that I will succumb to flattery.

337
00:30:14,812 --> 00:30:18,441
I have travelled very far in my life
and met many women,

338
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:20,985
but none that are immune to flattery.

339
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:24,739
-The Mother of Dragons!
-Here he comes.

340
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:30,620
Forgive me, I had terrible dreams
last night, terrible dreams.

341
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:35,500
I could not sleep until the sun
was shining and the birds were singing.

342
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:41,631
Look what a beauty you are, now
the Red Waste has been washed off you!

343
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:45,885
I am sorry about all that unpleasantness.

344
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:49,931
The silver hair of a true Targaryen.

345
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,016
Xaro Xhoan Daxos,

346
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:55,937
she is far too lovely for a glorified
dockworker like yourself.

347
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:59,399
Very true, and yet they say
that your grandfather,

348
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:01,484
who sold pepper off the back of a wagon,

349
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:05,071
married a lady far lovelier,
and higher born than himself.

350
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:09,576
Every lady alive was lovelier and
higher born than my grandfather.

351
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:15,039
Did my servants not offer you something
to eat? To drink?

352
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,958
I'll have them flogged in the square.

353
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,793
Thank you, my lord.
You are a gracious host.

354
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,754
But there is no servant alive
that can bring me what I want.

355
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:24,591
She has a talent for drama, this one.

356
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:28,595
So, my little princess,
what is it you want?

357
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:32,098
My birthright.
The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros.

358
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:35,143
I fear I'm no better than a servant
in this regard.

359
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,978
I cannot give you what I do not have.

360
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:41,608
I'm not asking you for the Kingdoms.
I'm asking you for ships.

361
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:42,942
I need to cross the Narrow Sea.

362
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:46,613
I need my ships as well.
I use them, you see,

363
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:49,741
-to bring spices from one port to another.
-Whatever you grant me now

364
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:53,369
will be repaid three times over
when I retake the Iron Throne.

365
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:57,206
Retake? Did you once sit
on the Iron Throne?

366
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,834
My father sat there
before he was murdered.

367
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:03,379
If you did not sit on it yourself,
would it not be correct

368
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:05,548
to say, "Take the Iron Throne"?

369
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:10,595
-I didn't come here to argue grammar.
-Of course not. You came to take my ships.

370
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:14,265
So, let me explain my position,
little princess.

371
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:18,603
Unlike you, I do not have
exalted ancestors.

372
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:23,775
I make my living by trade, and I judge
every trade on its merits.

373
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:28,696
You ask for ships.
You say I shall be repaid triple.

374
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,699
I do not doubt your honesty
or your intentions.

375
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:36,412
But before you repay your debts,
you must seize the Seven Kingdoms.

376
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:38,498
Do you have an army?

377
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:40,291
-Not yet.
-You do not have an army.

378
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,960
Do you have powerful allies in Westeros?

379
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:45,254
There are many there
that support my claim.

380
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,339
When were you there last?

381
00:32:47,965 --> 00:32:49,092
I left when I was a baby.

382
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:52,303
So, in truth, you have no allies.

383
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:56,599
The people will rise to fight
for their rightful queen when I return.

384
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:01,979
Forgive me, little princess,
but I cannot make an investment

385
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:05,400
based on wishes and dreams.
Now, if you'll pardon me.

386
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,860
Do you know Illyrio Mopatis,
Magister of Pentos?

387
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,613
Yes, we've met. A shrewd man.

388
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:14,409
For my wedding,
he gave me three petrified dragon eggs.

389
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:18,955
He believed, the world believed, that
the ages had turned them to stone.

390
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:22,417
How many centuries had it been
since dragons roamed the skies?

391
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:27,880
But I dreamt that if I carried those eggs
into a great fire, they would hatch.

392
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:32,343
When I stepped into the fire,
my own people thought I was mad.

393
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:39,267
But when the fire burnt out, I was unhurt,
the Mother of Dragons.

394
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,230
Do you understand?

395
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:52,405
I'm no ordinary woman.
My dreams come true.

396
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,662
I admire your passion.

397
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:04,333
But in business, I trust in logic,
not passion.

398
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,713
-I'm sorry, little princess.
-I am not your little princess.

399
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,924
I am Daenerys Stormborn
of the blood of Old Valyria,

400
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:13,926
and I will take what is mine.

401
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:18,306
-With fire and blood, I will take it.
-Yes, my lady.

402
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,600
But not with my ships.

403
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:43,539
-Who taught you to read?
-My father, my lord.

404
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:47,919
I taught my son Jaime to read.

405
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:53,883
Maester came to me one day,
told me he wasn't learning.

406
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:59,347
Couldn't make sense of the letters.
He reversed them in his head.

407
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,267
The maester said he had heard tell
of this affliction,

408
00:35:04,101 --> 00:35:05,686
and that we simply must accept it.

409
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:14,153
After that, I sat Jaime down
for four hours every day until he learned.

410
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:18,157
He hated me for it, for a time.

411
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:20,701
For a long time.

412
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,704
But he learned.

413
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,420
Where is your father? Is he alive?

414
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:38,719
-Who was he?
-A stonemason.

415
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:43,933
-A stonemason who could read?
-He taught himself.

416
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,018
Quite a man.

417
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:48,855
What killed him?

418
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:52,900
Loyalty.

419
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:57,446
You're a sharp little thing, aren't you?

420
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,076
Did--

421
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,539
Forgive me, my lord.
I shouldn't ask questions.

422
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:09,166
No.

423
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,128
But you've already begun.

424
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:16,549
Did you know your father, my lord?

425
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,176
I did.

426
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,263
I grew up with him.

427
00:36:25,182 --> 00:36:26,642
I watched him grow old.

428
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,900
He loved us. He was a good man.

429
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,028
But a weak man.

430
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:41,157
A weak man who nearly destroyed
our House and name.

431
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:45,411
I'm cold.

432
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,039
I'll fetch more wood for the fire,
my lord.

433
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:21,989
-Where you going, girl?
-The armory, my lord.

434
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,326
-Why?
-Lord Tywin sent me.

435
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:31,749
-What might this be?
-Lord Tywin gave it to me.

436
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:36,796
-What for?
-To take to the armory.

437
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:40,007
Why would he do that?

438
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,011
Let's go and ask him.

439
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:47,515
Move!

440
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:51,727
Get out of the way!

441
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,718
Amory Lorch.

442
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:28,306
A girl has named a second name.
A man will do what must be done.

443
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:29,348
Now!

444
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:33,269
A girl cannot tell a man when exactly
he must do a thing.

445
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:36,564
A man cannot make a thing happen
before its time.

446
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:39,317
But he's going to tell Tywin!
He's getting away! It has to be now!

447
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:49,702
Guard!

448
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:01,130
-Your Grace.
-Your Grace.

449
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,264
- Your Grace.
- …Took it up for myself.

450
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:13,601
Good spoils, that is.

451
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,147
-Your Grace.
-Friend.

452
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,170
Lady Talisa.

453
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:44,381
Your Grace.

454
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:47,802
I'm not sure I'm a "Lady."

455
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,720
Westerosi customs are still
a bit foreign to me.

456
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:52,681
It's hard to keep all
the rules straight. But…

457
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:55,226
if I remember my lessons,

458
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,686
a woman of noble birth
is always called a lady.

459
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,397
Unless she's a queen. Or a princess.

460
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:04,777
-I could find someone who knows.
-Why are you so sure I'm of noble birth?

461
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,196
Because it's obvious.

462
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:11,283
What if I told you my father sold lace
on the Long Bridge,

463
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:13,702
and my mother, my brother and I lived
with him above our shop?

464
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:17,373
I'd call you a liar.

465
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:20,042
Not very noble to accuse
a lady of dishonesty.

466
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,215
I always thought I was a brilliant liar.

467
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,468
Better at amputations, I'm afraid.

468
00:40:35,432 --> 00:40:38,310
-Quite a pretty spot.
-Will we be here long?

469
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:41,647
I couldn't really discuss troop movements
with you.

470
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:47,653
-I'm not a spy.
-Of course, a spy would deny being a spy.

471
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:51,407
You're right. You've found me out.

472
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:55,244
I'm writing a letter to the Lannisters.
"The Young Wolf is on the move."

473
00:40:57,913 --> 00:40:59,039
Perhaps you'd join me…

474
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,752
If you've got time, of course, for, well…

475
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:04,753
Robb?

476
00:41:07,464 --> 00:41:08,465
Mother.

477
00:41:15,472 --> 00:41:17,766
Mother, this is Lady Talisa.

478
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:23,022
She's been helping with the wounded.
She's been very… helpful.

479
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:25,816
-Lady Talisa.
-Lady Stark.

480
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:29,862
-Lady Talisa…?
-Maegyr.

481
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:34,909
Maegyr? Forgive me,
I do not know this name.

482
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:37,912
An uncommon name here.
An old name in Volantis.

483
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:41,040
Excuse me, my lady, Your Grace.

484
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:55,804
-I've missed you.
-Yes, you look positively forlorn.

485
00:41:56,347 --> 00:42:00,518
You surprised me, that's all.
I didn't think I'd see you today.

486
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:04,563
I wish that you were free
to follow your heart.

487
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:05,731
I know.

488
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:08,609
You have inherited
your father's responsibilities.

489
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:12,738
-I'm afraid they come at a cost. You…
-I know.

490
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:14,615
…are promised to another.

491
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:17,868
A debt that must be paid.

492
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,664
-I haven't forgotten.
-Your Grace.

493
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:24,875
My lady. News from Winterfell.

494
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:39,390
Your brothers desert you?

495
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:42,893
I can tell you which way to go.

496
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:48,023
We'll stop here. Too dark to go
any farther today.

497
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:49,191
Here?

498
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:52,069
-There's no shelter here.
-There's no shelter anywhere.

499
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:54,488
There is, if you know where to look.

500
00:42:58,534 --> 00:42:59,994
The cold could kill us both.

501
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:02,204
-If we light a fire, then--
-No fire.

502
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:04,581
-But a fire is--
-No fire.

503
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:08,877
Have it your way.

504
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:18,971
We'll stay warmer if we stay close.

505
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,934
Bet you freeze to death before I do.

506
00:43:25,602 --> 00:43:26,729
Bet your life.

507
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:54,214
Think they're out looking for you?

508
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:58,135
-Yes.
-Think they'll find you?

509
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:01,221
Yes.

510
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:05,059
You're brave.

511
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:09,855
Stupid… but brave.

512
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:16,028
We start again at first light.
Get some sleep.

513
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:36,256
-Stop moving.
-I'm just trying to get comfortable.

514
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:39,218
Stop it.

515
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:53,857
-You're still moving.
-Was I?

516
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:56,485
I didn't notice that time…

517
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:10,124
This cannot be true.

518
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:14,086
We've had ravens from White Harbor,
Barrowton and the Dreadfort.

519
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:15,879
I'm afraid it is true.

520
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:19,133
Why? Why would Theon--

521
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:21,468
Because the Greyjoys
are treasonous whores.

522
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:24,096
-My brothers?
-We've heard nothing of them.

523
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:28,350
But Rodrik Cassel is dead.

524
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:33,105
I told you, never trust a Greyjoy!

525
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:40,070
-I must go North at once.
-There's still a war to win, Your Grace.

526
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:42,656
How can I call myself king
if I can't hold my own castle?

527
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:44,867
How can I ask men to follow me
if I can't--

528
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:46,034
You are a king.

529
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:49,329
And that means you don't have
to do everything yourself.

530
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:50,956
Let me go and talk to Theon.

531
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:52,958
There will be no talk.
He will die for this.

532
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:56,545
Theon holds the castle
with a skeleton crew.

533
00:45:57,337 --> 00:45:59,548
Let me send word to my bastard
at the Dreadfort.

534
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:02,134
He can raise a few hundred men
and retake Winterfell

535
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:03,218
before the new moon.

536
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:06,054
We have the Lannisters on the run.

537
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:10,225
If you march all the way back north now,
you'll lose what you've gained.

538
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:14,563
My boy would be honored to bring you
Prince Theon's head.

539
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:19,026
Tell your son, Bran and Rickon's
safety is paramount.

540
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:22,654
And Theon, I want him brought to me alive.

541
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:26,700
I want to look him in the eye
and ask him why.

542
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:29,119
And then I'll take his head myself.

543
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:33,540
Why on earth would I trust the word
of a lying little savage like you?

544
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:34,750
I'm no liar.

545
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:40,214
All wildlings are liars and savages
with no loyalty to anything or anyone.

546
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:42,633
I done what I had to do to stay alive.

547
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:47,721
I hate the Starks as well as you do.
Let me serve you, my lord.

548
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:51,433
How? And don't tell me to put a spear
in your hand.

549
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,936
There are other ways to serve, my lord.

550
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:56,522
I am a prince now,

551
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:59,858
-and you'd do well--
-There are other ways to serve, my prince.

552
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:05,614
Like what?

553
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:10,869
We know things, the Free people.

554
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:13,038
You know things?

555
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:17,209
Like what? How to eat dirt?

556
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:20,837
Other things.

557
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:23,840
Savage things.

558
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:28,220
Wait outside.

559
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:47,823
I always wondered
what you had under there.

560
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:50,701
Comes at a price.

561
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:54,288
-I'm not killing you, that's your price.
-Already had that.

562
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:59,751
What do you want, then?
Other than your miserable life.

563
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:03,630
What all free people want. My freedom.

564
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:10,971
Well, you shall have it, then.

565
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:15,684
But only if you serve me well.

566
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:27,070
-It's not deep.
-I thought they were going to kill me.

567
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:28,947
They thought so, too.

568
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:33,994
He hated me, the man who hit me.
I saw it in his eyes. Hated me.

569
00:48:34,911 --> 00:48:38,707
He never met me before, but…
he wanted to hurt me.

570
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:42,169
-Of course he did.
-Why? Why would a stranger--

571
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:46,506
You are everything he will never have.
Your horse eats better than his children.

572
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:49,343
It doesn't matter now. He's dead.

573
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:52,137
I would have given them bread if I had it.

574
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:55,098
I hate the king more than any of them!

575
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:57,100
Don't say these things.

576
00:48:57,434 --> 00:49:00,103
-If the wrong people hear you--
-But you're not the wrong people.

577
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:10,197
Don't trust anybody.
Life is safer that way.

578
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:53,907
And where are you going?

579
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:58,662
I have something for you
from Prince Theon.

580
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:00,580
-What?
-Me.

581
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:06,294
He says I'm to make the rounds…

582
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:14,302
and keep you warm.

583
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:45,584
The Spice King refuses me
because I'm a bad investment.

584
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:47,419
The Silk King won't support me

585
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:49,421
because of his business
with the Lannisters,

586
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:51,131
why offend his best customer?

587
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:54,509
And the Copper King offers me
a single ship,

588
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:57,012
on the condition that I lie with him
for a night.

589
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:00,348
Does he think I will whore myself
for a boat?

590
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:04,436
When I came to this city, I had nothing.

591
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:08,857
Truly, nothing. I slept by the docks.

592
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:11,902
And when I could find work loading
the ships, I would eat.

593
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:14,362
If not, I dreamed of food.

594
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:17,657
Today, I am the richest man in Qarth.

595
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:22,913
Do you think the path from poverty
to wealth is always pure and honorable?

596
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:28,210
I have done many things, Khaleesi,
that a righteous man would condemn.

597
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:32,422
And here I am… with no regrets.

598
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:48,355
Bar the gates! Ring the bells!

599
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,107
Slowly, Khaleesi!

600
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:02,577
Where are they?

601
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:12,420
Where are my dragons?
