2
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:53,793
Connection is a strange thing!
Don't ask how it works.

3
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,472
Our friendship goes back years.

4
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,520
Our connection is stronger than
Wi-Fi, Bluetooth.

5
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,265
The best actor award goes to
Aryan Khanna.

6
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,194
First time I'm getting an award,
a major award in the film industry.

7
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:13,987
This one's for you, Ma.

8
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:15,565
Thank you very much.

9
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:19,326
Before I could walk, I learned
how to jump like Aryan

10
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:23,789
Aryan? The moron!

11
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:27,539
Anyone insults him

12
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:28,911
<i>I</i> fight.

13
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:35,130
If I copy his style...

14
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,385
I get whacked.

15
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,968
I don't think I've done enough work.
It's just been 5 years

16
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:42,766
I still have a long way to go
as an actor and star

17
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:47,059
I'll work hard and prove
I'm a genuine superstar.

18
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:50,308
I never compare.

19
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:53,319
What is better is to say you are the
best, not bother about others.

20
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:56,151
You're the greatest.
But I'm better.

21
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:59,908
Never met him. But I spend
all day with him.

22
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:03,029
That's real connection.

23
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:08,121
Whatever he does, I cut, copy,
paste, and ditto.

24
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,168
Tiny difference.

25
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:11,912
He became a star.

26
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:14,423
And I became his fan.

27
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:19,966
And something else.

28
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,013
We live together.

29
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,976
In one cinema or the other.

30
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,726
The real drama will start now!

31
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,282
None of my achievements
are my own.

32
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,828
I am who I am today,
I am where I am today.

33
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:53,287
It's all thanks to my fans.

34
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:57,170
Without my fans, I'm nothing.

35
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,093
Can't you even get 40% marks?

36
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:03,263
It's always Aryan, Aryan.

37
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:13,148
My parents don't get it.

38
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:16,352
He's not just a star,
he's my world.

39
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,859
But God bowled a great googly.

40
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:22,320
When God was making Aryan,
some clay was left behind...

41
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:23,988
God made me with that.

42
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:29,581
He and I are different.
Poles apart.

43
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:31,867
But we are one.

44
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:37,127
He is Aryan and me, Junior Aryan.

45
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:06,319
I topped up your phone.
200 rupees.

46
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,320
Send the money tomorrow.

47
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:09,743
Don't worry.

48
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,198
Tomorrow is fine.

49
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:13,125
The shop is closing now.

50
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,452
Check your phone.

51
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,959
You're a gem. Bye, aunty

52
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:22,380
Batman, Superman!
Enough slaughter.

53
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,632
Shut down now. Kill the bad guys
tomorrow.

54
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,556
- Gaurav, what's this?
- It's only 5.30, bro.

55
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:31,389
Don't act smart. I told you.
You're out by 5.30.

56
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,762
Go home, kids.

57
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:35,852
Don't mess with me.

58
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,735
All well?

59
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:48,990
Miss Call Center, where were you?
I'm closing.

60
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:49,949
So early?

61
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,247
- I have a show.
- 5 minutes. Please.

62
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,742
<i>No. I’ll be late.</i>

63
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,456
Only 5 minutes.

64
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:58,287
It's urgent.

65
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,793
I need a recommendation letter
for my US visa

66
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,171
I have a costume trial.

67
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,256
Can you do it later? OK then.

68
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:06,511
Thanks

69
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,176
5 minutes.

70
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,183
You don't let us stay and for her...

71
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:14,056
Her work is urgent. You just
shoot partridges.

72
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,896
I get what's urgent.

73
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,480
Come back tomorrow.

74
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,061
Get lost!

75
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:26,448
You losers.

76
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:43,208
Sitting here dreaming of America
won't help you.

77
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:46,757
But staring at Aryan's photo
will help you?

78
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,006
- Two minutes to go.
- All done.

79
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,476
Thank you.

80
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:58,230
How much?

81
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:03,527
Forget it. Can't charge you
for 5 minutes.

82
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:06,693
- Thanks.
- Enjoy!

83
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:14,030
Brothers, the shop is closed.

84
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,281
So the action just left?

85
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,329
What's 30 minutes?

86
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,665
I put this notice up a week ago.

87
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,705
“Due to the grand Dussehra show.

88
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:26,542
“Organised by the Resident Welfare
Assoc. lnder Vihar, DDA Colony.

89
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:29,299
“AK Cyber Chat closes
at 5:30 sharp.

90
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:32,924
“By order Gaurav Chandna,
proprietor AK Cyber Chat".

91
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,432
See you again.

92
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:38,600
If I knew English well, I'd be
a computer myself.

93
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:43,059
The shop won't stay open,
even for the Prime Minister

94
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,398
I said it's closed. You'll get
extra time tomorrow.

95
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:46,403
You photocopy!

96
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,238
Don't be cruel like Ravan.

97
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:51,616
This boy needs to watch porn.
He's upset.

98
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,284
I don't heal upset minds
at Cyber Chat.

99
00:06:56,625 --> 00:07:00,459
No porn films allowed here anyway.
Out, you guys!

100
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:05,039
You better outgrow Aryan Khanna.
Sid Kapoor is the man now.

101
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,129
Get smart, photocopy.

102
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:11,053
The shop in Sector 28 is open.

103
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:13,589
- Go there.
- Don't you dare touch me!

104
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:18,055
- Don't touch.
- Here, I'm touching.

105
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:25,567
Get out of here.

106
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,590
Let go! They need a lesson.

107
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,634
Want to see porn? Huh...

108
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,802
What are you doing?

109
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:05,141
Nothing. I let you chat.
So they made trouble

110
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:06,733
I'm fine.

111
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,439
You can all go. Thank you!

112
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,316
The jobless morons.

113
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:15,530
They came to watch blue films.
I whacked them.

114
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:19,822
Why play the hero?
Why didn't you call for help?

115
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,915
But I did call you.

116
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:25,960
My heart did.

117
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,796
So you came back.

118
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:32,968
Please, Gaurav. Stop talking
like Aryan.

119
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,804
Drop it. Coming to the show tonight?

120
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,557
Too much to do. I don't
have time like you.

121
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,972
Today's a birthday special.

122
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,886
No, thank you.

123
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:43,971
Welcome.

124
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:54,148
How did you get hurt?

125
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:58,118
Who hit you? I'll complain to
the association.

126
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,738
It's fine. Don't ruin my concentration.

127
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:05,038
Concentration? You can't move.
How will you go on stage?

128
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:09,080
The prize is 20,000. Cash!

129
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:13,379
You won't give me 20,000
to go and meet Aryan.

130
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,087
My only chance to fulfill my dream.

131
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:20,011
I don't have money to burn
on your silly dreams.

132
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:23,218
What about your Tuesday trips
to the Hanuman temple?

133
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:26,183
Doesn't your 101 -rupee donation
go up in smoke?

134
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,354
Hanumanji is a God.
And your Aryan...

135
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,734
He's important to me.

136
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,489
Every fool has met him,
only I haven't.

137
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,198
Spray some scent on me.

138
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,454
- Careful.
- If you can't do it, never mind.

139
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,991
My fans are waiting. Get ready.

140
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,543
Listen to your mother.
Stop your drama.

141
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,463
The real drama starts now.

142
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:54,666
Hold on to your hearts.

143
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:58,136
You're about to see a performance...

144
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:01,636
that the Western Union,
moving money for better...

145
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:05,303
Super Star competition
can never do without.

146
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,146
You guessed right.

147
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:12,355
Here he comes.
The two-year winner:

148
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,900
Our Aryan Khanna Junior

149
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,525
Jindal aunty!

150
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,737
Your pressure cooker on the stove?

151
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:00,361
The only whistle you'll hear
today is right here.

152
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:03,402
My hattrick year.

153
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,572
Today I'll share something personal.

154
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,661
About me and Aryan.

155
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:10,709
I hide nothing from you

156
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:14,254
I'm no ace at romancing.

157
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:18,800
But when I see her, my emotions
go haywire.

158
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,298
Words escape me.

159
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:27,768
Senior is an expert heart-stealer.
So I asked him...

160
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,184
to help his Junior.

161
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:42,366
It's delicate. I must tread carefully.

162
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,408
Don't forget.

163
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:47,283
The heart's job is to beat.

164
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,411
When you count the night stars...

165
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,785
and yearn to etch my name
on every star.

166
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,705
You know you're in love.

167
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:00,092
When you want to turn back
as you walk ahead.

168
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:04,426
When you look for me
in a crowd.

169
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:07,508
You know you're in love.

170
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,142
If you don't believe me.

171
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,854
Then hold my hand.

172
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,771
If your heart stops, then you know...

173
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,065
you're in love.

174
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,942
I don't have your style, Senior.

175
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:28,199
But if anyone insults you...

176
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,029
l want to break their teeth.

177
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,037
Mummy says, “Calm down”

178
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,498
“Aryan is India's sweetheart”.

179
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:37,913
But he's a Delhi boy after all.

180
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:42,839
Come, Senior. Let's show them
some Delhi muscle.

181
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:25,506
Ma used to say: “Don't weigh
the food you're eating.

182
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:31,718
“Don't count the guys you whack”.

183
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:40,312
Here.

184
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,564
Use this.

185
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,984
I feel like just staring
at the screen.

186
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:50,989
I have this dream.

187
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,742
Keep doing your thing
with your heroines

188
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,332
I've been your fan forever.

189
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,876
I think you owe me a dance.

190
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:00,583
We'll have a blast.

191
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:03,920
No one will tell who is Senior,
who is Junior. Hit it!

192
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:22,578
One last thing before I go.

193
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:26,589
I am what I am today.

194
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,588
I am where I am today.

195
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,338
It's all thanks to my fans.

196
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,182
Without my fans

197
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:39,185
I'm nothing.

198
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:44,562
Brothers and sisters!

199
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:47,523
The Virat act did not impress us.

200
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,272
The Katrina act did not impress.

201
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:53,234
This year like every other year.

202
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,403
The Western Union, moving money
for better...

203
00:15:56,622 --> 00:16:00,411
Super Star competition's trophy
goes to our very own...

204
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,917
Gaurav Chandna.

205
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:10,334
Give him a big hand!

206
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:27,063
I want to thank my Mummy.

207
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,356
My Papa.

208
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,488
My God.

209
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:36,151
The greatest actor in the world.

210
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:38,904
The Aryan Khanna.

211
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:57,631
OK, go.

212
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:01,260
But why travel without a ticket?

213
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,640
- Go later.
- Later?

214
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:09,060
Aryan's birthday is in 2 days.
And I must wait to book a ticket?

215
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:12,400
The ticket collector will catch you
and belt you.

216
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:14,235
Remind her...

217
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,907
how Aryan travelled to Mumbai
for the first time.

218
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,577
- WT.
- Without ticket!

219
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:23,324
You want to give him the trophy?
Courier it. Post it.

220
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:25,742
Papa, count the cash again.

221
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,544
Phony fans cheer him from afar.

222
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:33,505
But I'll hug him and hand him
the trophy myself.

223
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:36,135
- Like this.
- Have you gone mad?

224
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,012
Control the boy.

225
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:40,219
Here. 20,000

226
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,307
ls your spit on the notes?

227
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:46,725
Socks, in the outside pocket.
Underwear, inside the bag.

228
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:49,441
Any extra underwear? I'll have
no time to wash them.

229
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:53,229
Here. Give this to him from
your Papa and me

230
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:54,524
Sohan halwa.

231
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:58,491
Tell him your father got it
especially for him.

232
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:01,904
- From Chandni Chowk.
- Why tell him? I'll show him

233
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:06,165
I'll show Aryan a family selfie.
Come, we'll get the background.

234
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:09,411
Mummy, hold the box.
I'll hold the trophy.

235
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:11,462
Papa, hide those undies.

236
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,378
- Cheese.
- Cheese!

237
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,631
- Shall I drop you at the station?
- No, you go to the shop.

238
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:19,588
- Can you manage?
- Sure.

239
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:21,055
Don't overstay at Aryan's

240
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,466
I've only four days leave.
Can't extend.

241
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:25,469
Don't worry, Papa. By mummy.

242
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,136
Be careful, son.

243
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:30,940
Where to?

244
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,062
Hi!

245
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:35,278
Your parents throw you out?

246
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:38,691
Keep dreaming about moving
to America

247
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,283
I'm off to meet Aryan,
face-to-face.

248
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,993
Told Aryan you're coming?

249
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:47,123
He's my Aryan, not America.
No visa needed

250
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:51,495
I'm going to America to make a new
life. You'll get zero meeting Aryan.

251
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:56,215
Forget it, you won't understand.

252
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:48,767
Hello, uncle.

253
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:50,061
Hello, aunty.

254
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,101
Your ice cream.

255
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:01,398
One vegetarian meal.

256
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:02,907
Seat number?

257
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,871
100

258
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,666
I'll get it.

259
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:19,006
If you want to stretch your legs
or your back, tell me.

260
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,425
It's only one night. We'll adjust.

261
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,054
Allow me.

262
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:31,852
Now it's OK.

263
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:39,940
Let me put uncle's plate down.
Don't worry.

264
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,047
We're coming.

265
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,132
Without ticket?

266
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:09,098
Uncle, it's a long story.

267
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:11,642
Let me explain

268
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:15,935
I'll do the explaining. Call
Ratlam police station.

269
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:19,146
Let him spend two days inside.
No more WT travelling.

270
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,857
Uncle, you don't get it. I could've
bought the ticket

271
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:25,315
- I want to travel without one.
- Come along

272
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:28,068
I'm not a thief or a criminal.

273
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,953
You see tomorrow is
Aryan Khanna's birthday.

274
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:32,576
No point if I get there late

275
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:33,452
Aryan Khanna?

276
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,958
Right! He went to Mumbai WT.

277
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,039
Stayed at Hotel Delite.
Room number 205

278
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,792
I'll be staying there too.
Get the picture?

279
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,920
Let me get to Mumbai.
You won't lose anything.

280
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,969
Here's the ticket money. Keep it.

281
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,720
- But I'll travel WT.
- Shut up!

282
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:50,264
You need a tight slap.

283
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,726
Take him. He won't listen.

284
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,310
Damn you!

285
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,059
Take me to Mumbai. Or I'll jump.

286
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:04,358
You'll be answering the cops
all night.

287
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,405
Want to die? Get back inside.

288
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:09,234
If I can't see Aryan Khanna
on his birthday...

289
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:11,034
no point living.

290
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:13,659
Don't lose your head over
these film stars.

291
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,666
He may be a film star to you.
But he's special to me.

292
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,543
Give me your hand or you'll die.

293
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:21,333
- Take me to Mumbai.
- OK! Give me your hand.

294
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:25,008
- One veg meal?
- Done. Give me your hand.

295
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:26,588
OK, hold me

296
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:39,101
ls he a relative? Do you
really know him?

297
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:42,441
ls he family? What are you
to Aryan Khanna?

298
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,320
A fan.

299
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:13,423
<i>Room 205 is occupied.</i>

300
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:16,058
Why? I've booked it.

301
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,931
No bookings here.

302
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,513
First come, first serve.
Pay cash, take the key

303
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,645
I'll pay double.

304
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:29,568
But only room 205.

305
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:33,572
If you don't give it to me,
just see what I'll do.

306
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:42,126
Hey boy! Move the stuff from 205
to 209.

307
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:46,046
Here, brother. Room 205 for you.

308
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:18,992
Happy birthday, Senior.

309
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:02,957
Let me pass, brother. I'm late.
Move it!

310
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:12,629
What a crowd! By God.

311
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:14,752
Brother, move aside.

312
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:23,894
The press over there.

313
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:28,562
Let them come in.

314
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:32,486
A selfie! Smile.

315
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:35,690
Thank you.

316
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:40,702
These two-faced fans.

317
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,451
They moan about his films.

318
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:47,455
And come here to pose with him.

319
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:50,330
You can't go there

320
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:54,585
I'm not one of them. Those FB types.
Phony fans

321
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:56,844
I'm Gaurav Chandna

322
00:25:57,347 --> 00:26:00,590
I've come from Delhi. WT.
Rajdhani Express.

323
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,008
Guess where I'm staying?

324
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:05,556
Guess!

325
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:11,146
Hotel Delite. Room number 205.

326
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,018
Don't you get it?

327
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:15,654
I'll show you magic.

328
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:17,657
You'll enjoy it. Look!

329
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,618
When you count the night stars...

330
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:27,371
and yearn to etch her name
on every star.

331
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,412
You know you're in love.

332
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,456
When her breath is carried
by the breeze...

333
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:35,295
Lets go <i>press.</i>

334
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,384
You know you're in love.

335
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:40,054
When you turn back as you walk ahead.

336
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:41,464
Check the press IDs.

337
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,431
Go inside.

338
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,261
Not you! Don't you get it?

339
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:50,226
I want to show him my trophy

340
00:26:50,651 --> 00:26:53,359
l just want him to see it.
Then I'll be gone.

341
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:58,363
Moron!

342
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,862
If Aryan ever hears that
you hit me...

343
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:02,943
he’ll thrash you.

344
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:06,660
It's OK. It's nothing.

345
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,482
Mummy sent you special halwa.

346
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:25,326
And this trophy... your birthday.
Mummy sent special halwa.

347
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:25,586
<i>Yes, Mummy?</i>

348
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,630
I'm fine

349
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:30,557
Aryan is fine, too.

350
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:34,387
I haven't met him yet. You're talking
like a child, Mummy.

351
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:37,060
He's a superstar. How can
I just meet him?

352
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:39,980
There are thousands of people
here to meet him.

353
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:42,729
They've built a 50 ft wall
in front of him.

354
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:45,781
The poor guy is stuck alone behind it.

355
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:50,282
Scream as hard as you want,
he can't hear

356
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:56,371
I'm hanging up. I'll call later.

357
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:12,262
They say common sense deserts
a man in bad times.

358
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:14,928
Seems that's Aryan Khanna's
fate now.

359
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:18,848
In his twilight years, his films
are bombing.

360
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:22,360
No surprise that he's on edge
and snappy.

361
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:26,363
On his 48th birthday, he showed
his irritation...

362
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,941
through his gift to Sid Kapoor.

363
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:31,527
No star has matched Aryan till now.

364
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:33,695
But Sid Kapoor...

365
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:37,537
has pulled the rug
from under his feet.

366
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,919
The party guests said...

367
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,167
Sid Kapoor just hinted that...

368
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:46,050
Aryan Khanna's days were over.

369
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:48,711
What did Kapoor tell Aryan Khanna...

370
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:52,131
that made him hit Sid Kapoor?

371
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:54,433
I went to wish him happy birthday.

372
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:58,058
Look what he did to me!
Totally out of order.

373
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:01,265
He's an elder. I respect him a lot.

374
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:05,979
I always say I've learned how
to act by watching his films.

375
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:09,190
I don't know why I make him
insecure.

376
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,901
What will you do?
Take legal action?

377
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,322
I should

378
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,704
I'll talk to my legal team.

379
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:19,492
Let's see what they say.
It's my duty to do something.

380
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:24,130
So no newcomer is mistreated
by a senior star.

381
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,503
That's all I want to say.

382
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:31,137
We'll talk after I've consulted
my legal team.

383
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:43,978
Liar! Cheat.

384
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:48,195
Playing the good boy on TV.
Anyone can see through you.

385
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,481
You think he's insecure?

386
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:54,701
He's seen off dozens like you.

387
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:57,154
No one has touched Aryan Khanna
for 25 years.

388
00:31:57,624 --> 00:32:00,161
Do your worst, sonny!

389
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,460
No one can touch him.

390
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,124
Just you wait.

391
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:20,348
Cut it!

392
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:30,066
Great shot.

393
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,446
Superb!

394
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,282
- Liked it?
- Fantastic.

395
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,668
Sid Kapoor! You swallowed
Aryan Khanna whole.

396
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,177
What dialogue delivery!

397
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:59,638
You've destroyed Aryan Khanna.
Blew him away.

398
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:02,769
I am your biggest fan, sir.

399
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,059
At the contest back home...

400
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,184
It's my bad luck I look like Aryan,
but I always impersonate you

401
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:09,435
I win, sir

402
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:12,187
I've even won a trophy.
I love you, sir.

403
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:15,566
Let me show you my trophy, sir.
Please...

404
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:18,577
- You let the girls through.
- Let him come.

405
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,286
Sir says yes.

406
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:22,490
Sorry. Give me space

407
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:26,452
I'll show you my act?

408
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:27,456
OK

409
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:38,513
The mind always outsmarts
the face, Mr. Singhania.

410
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:41,012
You can ape someone.

411
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:43,970
But you can't ape his mind.

412
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:48,562
When all doors are shut.

413
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:51,314
There's a knock at mind's door.

414
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:55,026
And when that door opens,
you see a new road.

415
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,492
I have walked that road to you,
Singhania.

416
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:05,036
And through that very door
you shall walk to your peril.

417
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:08,578
You're too good, fan.

418
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:11,292
Well done, man.

419
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,004
Relax man, calm down.

420
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:19,547
I have the same jacket you're wearing.

421
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,474
That's good. Very nice.

422
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:25,515
- Sir's lunch break now.
- One chance, sir

423
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:30,183
Santosh, bring me the salad
in half an hour.

424
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:32,901
And this fan, come on!

425
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:34,603
Hear that?

426
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:39,404
- Sit down.
- No, thank you.

427
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:44,913
Sir, a small suggestion from a fan.

428
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,749
Why fight with Aryan Khanna?

429
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:51,791
Why bother with the police
and police reports?

430
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:53,334
That's nothing, bro

431
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:55,875
I'll drag him to court.

432
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:57,877
Allow me.

433
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:00,633
Time's up for Aryan Khanna.

434
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:05,349
- I'll wring your neck.
- Santosh!

435
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:09,805
To hell with Santosh.

436
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:12,645
Shut up! No one is coming.

437
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:16,403
Close your mouth.

438
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:20,608
Now listen... sit quietly...

439
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:25,534
Don't open your mouth again
to insult Aryan. One peep and...

440
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:28,915
I'll crush your chocolate face
with the wrapper.

441
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,337
No fan will look at you again.

442
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:40,879
Spouting pearls of wisdom on TV.
Look at my camera.

443
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,510
Read! Here's the script.
Learn the lines.

444
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,637
Do your rubbish acting.

445
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,940
Your damn phone never
stops ringing.

446
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,029
Now I’ll see.

447
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:02,282
Read it!

448
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:06,737
Start.

449
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,284
It's in Hindi, dude.

450
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:18,666
You're a Hindi film hero
and you can't read Hindi?

451
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,297
Where do they find you guys?

452
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:25,430
What do you film people say?

453
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:27,636
Action!

454
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:29,012
Dear Aryan sir

455
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:31,303
I'm really very sorry.

456
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:34,064
My statement to the press
was all lies

457
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,103
I wanted to spoil your name.

458
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:40,188
No one can take your place.
You're the best.

459
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:43,907
The greatest, the most evergreen
super-duper star.

460
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:47,068
I apologise again.

461
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:50,789
Think of me as your kid brother
and forgive me.

462
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:54,126
Why won't he play with you?
Shall I tell him to?

463
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:56,082
Dad, he bullies me.

464
00:36:57,674 --> 00:36:59,631
He bullies you because
he's scared of you.

465
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:02,342
He thinks you'll win. We'll cheat!

466
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,761
- Dhruv, let's play.
- Dad, come on.

467
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:06,509
Play with lsha. I've trained her.

468
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,687
- I am so sorry.
- Dad, you made me lose a point.

469
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:16,769
Now she's ahead of you.
Try and win from her

470
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:23,276
I'm glad Sid realised his mistake.
He's a great guy. Young and new.

471
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:25,402
Glad it got sorted.

472
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,199
Ladies and gentlemen,
last point, next point.

473
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:33,624
Nothing is sorted, it's a game.

474
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,957
Apology. Say sorry - it's all a game.

475
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:41,252
You should've controlled yourself

476
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:42,749
I tried very hard

477
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,006
I gave him one slap. More a pat.

478
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:48,672
See the scandal it's created.

479
00:37:49,476 --> 00:37:52,184
If someone comes to my house,
drinks my expensive wine.

480
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:55,395
Flirts with my wife. Must I just
stand by and watch?

481
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,935
You have no time.

482
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:00,229
Let someone else flirt with me.

483
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:02,819
Actually you're right.

484
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:06,490
But not this moron.

485
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:11,278
The video has gone viral.
Social media is abuzz.

486
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:15,411
Join us for the stock market news
after this short break

487
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:39,773
Aryan, wake up!

488
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:41,900
What happened?

489
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:43,773
Did you sleep here all night?

490
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:47,865
I was reading a script. It was
so good that I dozed off

491
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:52,244
Sunaina is here. She has something
to wake you up with.

492
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:53,574
Good morning, Aryan.

493
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:54,947
It's too early, Sunaina

494
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:58,082
I know. I'm really sorry.
I have to tell you something.

495
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,247
- Are you pregnant?
- Shut up, Aryan.

496
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:02,711
See this.

497
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:06,090
Come on. Look here and say
your lines. Hurry.

498
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:07,926
Dear Aryan sir.

499
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,045
Look here. Look at the camera.

500
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:13,682
OK. I'll do it.

501
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:17,678
- Come on.
- Did Aryan send you?

502
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:21,432
Aryan has nothing to do with it.
Do as you're told. The camera.

503
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:25,440
If you want cash, take it.
Just let me go.

504
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,897
Cash? I'll give you cash.

505
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,986
Stop! I'll do it.

506
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:33,785
What will you do? Scum!

507
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:54,097
A fan.

508
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:57,054
Calls himself Junior Aryan Khanna.

509
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,098
He sent a message.

510
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:02,807
“A small birthday gift to the love
of my life, Senior Aryan Khanna.

511
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:07,478
Call me once to thank me.
My life will be set”.

512
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:18,530
Hello.

513
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:23,417
Junior Aryan Khanna?

514
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:25,749
You calling from Aryan's house?

515
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:27,288
YES

516
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:32,507
Where is Senior? Aryan Khanna?

517
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:36,552
He's busy right now. He asked me
to call you.

518
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:40,178
How come he's so busy?
No time to talk to his Junior?

519
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:42,095
I did so much for him.

520
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:44,932
I came to the house on his birthday,
The crowd...

521
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:46,604
Yeah, yeah, hello

522
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,112
Aryan...

523
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:55,241
Aryan Khanna?

524
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:58,870
Gaurav this side.
Your fan, your Junior.

525
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:00,993
Where are you?

526
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:03,833
<i>Just guess</i>

527
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:10,582
Delite hotel, in your room.

528
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,761
Room no. 205. Charni Road.
Remember?

529
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:19,428
But if you're calling to say
thank you, it won't do.

530
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:22,018
I deserve a hug from my brother.

531
00:41:24,107 --> 00:41:25,563
- You want to see me?
- Sure

532
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:27,937
I made a big scandal just to meet you.

533
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:32,278
Wait there. I'll send a car to
pick you up.

534
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:35,607
Done, Senior.

535
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:37,742
Thank you!

536
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:46,163
Mind blasting.

537
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:48,624
Really?

538
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:51,123
Go by taxi.

539
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:55,135
You're going to Aryan Khanna's.
Don't go by auto-rickshaw.

540
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:58,046
He's sending me his personal car.

541
00:41:58,307 --> 00:41:59,843
He's invited me home.

542
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:02,221
Don't forget to take pictures.

543
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,514
If he offers you any food, no
pouncing on it like a pauper.

544
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:11,063
Food? I'm not going for the food.
I'm going there to hug him.

545
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:15,651
Tell him to wear the clothes I had
made for him at Diwali.

546
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:20,110
- Make sure he takes the trophy.
- As though he wouldn't.

547
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,158
- Say hello from me.
- And me, too.

548
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:26,199
OK. I'll tell him.

549
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,869
Phone me once you've met him.

550
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:31,755
The car's here. Call you later.

551
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,457
The car is there.

552
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:40,342
Hello.

553
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:48,138
Are you the driver?

554
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:50,398
Junior Aryan Khanna?

555
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:53,940
- Did you act smart with Sid Kapoor?
- No.

556
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:56,980
You're mistaken.

557
00:42:58,493 --> 00:42:59,733
Did Sid Kapoor send you?

558
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,905
I'll tell you later. Come

559
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:05,238
I'm meeting Aryan.
I won't go anywhere.

560
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:08,499
- Like hell you won't.
- I won't come.

561
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:12,045
Don't touch me.

562
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:14,668
No touching.

563
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:23,340
Let me go!

564
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:39,187
Stop!

565
00:46:00,925 --> 00:46:01,960
Try catching me!

566
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:07,504
- Stop! You rascal.
- Please don't hit me.

567
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:13,427
Don't hit hard. We have orders.

568
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:22,727
Let's go.

569
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:26,151
Let me call Aryan Khanna.

570
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:27,948
Where are you taking me?

571
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,741
Sid Kapoor is evil. Don't get
mixed up with him.

572
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,034
Shut up!

573
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:41,834
I did it for Aryan Khanna.
His problem is my problem.

574
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:48,753
If Aryan hears about this...

575
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:50,797
he’ll skin you alive.

576
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:53,303
Stop!

577
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:58,893
Think carefully. We'll be back.
Let's go.

578
00:47:26,761 --> 00:47:28,343
Good evening, sir. Come in.

579
00:47:43,444 --> 00:47:45,936
We asked him why he made the video.

580
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:48,613
He says he'll talk only to you.

581
00:47:49,075 --> 00:47:51,908
You told us to go easy on him.

582
00:47:52,495 --> 00:47:54,532
- Hardly touched him.
- Thank you.

583
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:56,992
- Usman.
- Yes, sir?

584
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:00,708
This is for his expenses.

585
00:48:01,087 --> 00:48:02,498
Keep him here for 2 days.

586
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,954
Get him a ticket to Delhi.
Take him to the station.

587
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:08,004
As I said, don't beat him up
too badly.

588
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:09,838
Just enough to scare him.

589
00:48:10,346 --> 00:48:12,303
No one must hear about this.

590
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:16,888
No police record, no video statement.
Please.

591
00:48:17,186 --> 00:48:18,392
Sure, sir.

592
00:48:18,813 --> 00:48:20,429
Where is he?

593
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:23,856
I want to meet him alone.

594
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:26,809
- You stay here.
- Yeah

595
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:40,915
Gaurav.

596
00:49:03,232 --> 00:49:04,222
Senior.

597
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:05,765
You're here.

598
00:49:07,403 --> 00:49:09,235
I knew you'd come.

599
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:12,530
They hit me and hit me.

600
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:15,032
They broke my bones.

601
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:19,988
I protected my face.

602
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:23,537
It's Aryan Khanna's face.
Nothing must happen to it.

603
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:33,297
See? Same to same.

604
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:38,347
Everyone calls me Junior
Aryan Khanna. But I say...

605
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:40,012
there’s only one Aryan Khanna.

606
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:43,727
Relax.

607
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:46,723
It's OK.

608
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:55,489
I impersonate you at the yearly
Super Star competition.

609
00:49:57,161 --> 00:49:58,276
Always win first prize.

610
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:04,123
The bastards took my bag.
My trophy was in it.

611
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,166
I brought it to show you.

612
00:50:10,633 --> 00:50:12,215
I could show you my act

613
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:25,728
I'm nervous in front of you.

614
00:50:26,607 --> 00:50:28,314
It's all right. Sit.

615
00:50:28,776 --> 00:50:33,065
No audience here. Their screaming
and cheering helps.

616
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:35,146
- Are you from Delhi?
- West Delhi.

617
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:37,315
You're from Rajender Nagar,
I'm from lnder Vihar.

618
00:50:37,493 --> 00:50:39,780
Two traffic lights from the TV tower.
Near DAV Park.

619
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:41,823
Listen carefully.

620
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:45,373
You did something nasty.

621
00:50:46,919 --> 00:50:48,000
It's a crime.

622
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:52,960
A crime in the eyes of the law.
Love in your eyes, no?

623
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:55,758
Not love, it's stupidity.

624
00:50:58,347 --> 00:50:59,712
Do you have family?

625
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,177
There's Papa, Mummy.

626
00:51:02,977 --> 00:51:04,217
And you, too.

627
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:06,389
Have you thought what
your parents would say?

628
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:09,313
They'd be sad seeing you
in that sadistic video.

629
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:12,816
Why would we show it to them?
It was for you.

630
00:51:13,404 --> 00:51:14,894
Did you like my birthday gift?

631
00:51:15,531 --> 00:51:18,569
Sid Kapoor? I beat the crap
out of him.

632
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:25,162
I don't understand how the cops
discovered our little secret.

633
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:27,540
Our?

634
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:33,208
There is no “our” between
you and me.

635
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:36,165
The police brought you here
on my orders.

636
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:39,335
You made a mistake. You
had to be punished.

637
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:41,925
So you won't mess up again.

638
00:51:45,311 --> 00:51:48,770
On your orders? I did so much for you.

639
00:51:52,401 --> 00:51:54,483
Who are you to do anything
for me?

640
00:51:57,865 --> 00:51:58,980
I'm your fan.

641
00:52:00,743 --> 00:52:03,280
- You're my star.
- Fan? So you do as you please?

642
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:06,616
Thrash people? Murder?

643
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:11,417
If need be, I could murder for you.

644
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:16,747
You're not my fan.

645
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:20,126
Don't say that.

646
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:22,928
I risked my life to meet you.

647
00:52:23,766 --> 00:52:27,009
I hit Sid Kapoor a little, so you'd
meet me. What did I want...

648
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:28,801
in return?

649
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:33,226
To see you, a few photos,
an autograph. That's all.

650
00:52:35,444 --> 00:52:38,778
- Can't you spare 5 min of your life?
- It's my life.

651
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,652
Why must I give you even
five seconds?

652
00:53:08,477 --> 00:53:11,686
I am who I am today,
where I am today.

653
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:14,472
My stardom.

654
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:18,942
It's all thanks to my fans.

655
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:23,739
If it weren't for my fans...

656
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,196
I'd be nothing

657
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,588
Gaurav makes Aryan.

658
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:45,920
Without Gaurav...

659
00:53:47,266 --> 00:53:48,506
Aryan is nothing.

660
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:53,887
Now you listen carefully.

661
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:57,853
When the police let you go,
go straight to Delhi, get it?

662
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:00,017
I'll forget all about Gaurav.

663
00:54:00,279 --> 00:54:02,862
And you forget you ever met Aryan.

664
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:07,487
Stay in your life.
I stay in mine.

665
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:12,246
This is your final warning. OK.

666
00:54:26,138 --> 00:54:27,173
Forget it.

667
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:29,387
You won't understand.

668
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:44,041
Yes, Mummy

669
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:45,547
I'll be home soon.

670
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:46,256
Everything OK?

671
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:47,336
Everything is fine.

672
00:55:47,511 --> 00:55:48,717
Why didn't you take my call?

673
00:55:48,929 --> 00:55:50,135
I was busy

674
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:51,795
Gaurav, we're worried about you.

675
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:52,755
Don't worry.

676
00:55:52,975 --> 00:55:54,431
You'll come home soon?

677
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:56,426
Tell Papa to mind the Cyber Cafe.

678
00:55:56,645 --> 00:55:57,601
Are you eating properly?

679
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:59,557
The food is fine here.

680
00:56:02,818 --> 00:56:03,853
Thank you.

681
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:05,873
Come, hero. Sir wants you.

682
00:57:08,884 --> 00:57:13,924
Whatever happened has happened.
Put it behind you. Right?

683
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:17,131
Thank you, brother. I made
a mistake. Sorry

684
00:57:48,507 --> 00:57:49,372
Gaurav!

685
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:54,342
Did you hug Aryan Khanna?

686
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:10,605
Didn't he meet you?
Didn't spare 5 minutes?

687
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:12,690
Don't you feel bad.

688
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:15,778
It's not my loss. It's his.

689
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:19,736
He's happy where he is.
I'm happy where I am.

690
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:25,162
Mummy, make me some
rice and beans tonight.

691
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:56,567
Hello, aunty.

692
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:58,490
You're moving out?

693
00:58:58,744 --> 00:59:01,236
Who knows what this boy wants.

694
00:59:01,413 --> 00:59:03,245
Got a good price?

695
00:59:03,749 --> 00:59:06,366
Don't worry, Papa. I'll invest wisely.

696
00:59:06,752 --> 00:59:09,084
Too much time wasted on Aryan.

697
00:59:10,464 --> 00:59:11,954
The shop is sold, Mummy.
Let's go.

698
00:59:12,299 --> 00:59:14,006
Hurry. You coming?

699
00:59:14,426 --> 00:59:15,712
- Let's go.
- OK, come.

700
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:17,842
All well, aunty?

701
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:56,100
Fans chase stars.

702
01:00:57,404 --> 01:00:59,645
Now a star will chase a fan.

703
01:01:01,408 --> 01:01:04,446
Whenever Aryan Khanna's name
is taken...

704
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:08,779
it’ll be in the same breath
<i>as</i> Gaurav Chandna

705
01:01:35,734 --> 01:01:37,270
1 Year later.

706
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:40,644
Welcome to Bollywood Café.
98.1 FM.

707
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:42,738
Do you know what's special
about the weekend?

708
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:44,197
Guys, this weekend...

709
01:01:44,326 --> 01:01:47,034
is the Aryan Khanna reloaded
show presented by Hyundai.

710
01:01:47,621 --> 01:01:50,113
Stars have a great life

711
01:01:50,457 --> 01:01:52,539
I want a life like Aryan's.

712
01:01:52,751 --> 01:01:53,866
Full on, jet setter!

713
01:01:54,044 --> 01:01:56,251
One day in London, Dubrovnik the next.

714
01:01:56,421 --> 01:01:58,207
For the grand Bhutiani wedding.

715
01:01:58,423 --> 01:02:00,039
Then back to the London show.

716
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:00,998
Wow!

717
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:04,339
Do you know London is
one of his favourite places?

718
01:02:04,512 --> 01:02:07,254
In fact he considers it his
second home after Mumbai.

719
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:12,267
We have some good news
and some bad news.

720
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:13,806
The bad news first, obviously.

721
01:02:14,064 --> 01:02:16,772
The Hyundai Aryan Khanna reloaded
show is houseful.

722
01:02:17,025 --> 01:02:18,936
Oh no! What's the good news?

723
01:02:19,194 --> 01:02:22,107
We have 20 free tickets
for our listeners.

724
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:26,232
Who ever is the first to answer
my question correctly...

725
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:28,525
wins a free show ticket.

726
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:32,955
My question follows straight after
this beautiful song.

727
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:46,460
Here's your tickets. Enjoy your visit.

728
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:50,714
- How can I help you?
- One ticket please.

729
01:02:53,687 --> 01:02:54,597
Enjoy your visit.

730
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:46,611
The real drama starts now

731
01:03:50,702 --> 01:03:51,737
Aryan Khanna!

732
01:04:03,631 --> 01:04:06,168
Mr. Khanna, Tim Baker,
the Manager

733
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,046
Aryan Khanna, the actor.

734
01:04:09,929 --> 01:04:11,294
I hope it's not a bother.

735
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:13,467
Fans never bother.

736
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:20,724
Sir, a photo with your wax figure.

737
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:24,809
Let me say this. It's amazing.

738
01:04:25,153 --> 01:04:27,235
You've come all the way to London...

739
01:04:27,655 --> 01:04:29,316
to take a photo with
my wax figure.

740
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:33,029
Really, that's very sweet.
ls this better?

741
01:04:34,913 --> 01:04:35,618
Better now?

742
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:39,197
Let me warn you.

743
01:04:39,793 --> 01:04:40,954
I was much younger then.

744
01:04:42,128 --> 01:04:43,243
You like it?

745
01:04:43,505 --> 01:04:44,370
Honestly...

746
01:04:45,048 --> 01:04:46,038
it's very scary.

747
01:04:47,759 --> 01:04:49,500
So, does he look like me?

748
01:04:49,803 --> 01:04:52,386
- You look great in real life.
- Exactly, darling

749
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:55,885
I agree. What a fat nose he has.

750
01:04:56,476 --> 01:04:58,467
My nose is tiny.

751
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:01,311
A phony face.

752
01:05:01,773 --> 01:05:02,888
A fake smile.

753
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:04,480
All phony.

754
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:06,937
I don't smile like this.

755
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:10,563
Actually no one smiles like this.

756
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:15,192
His hair smells bad.
Feels bad, looks bad.

757
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:20,997
In fact, I don't look like him at all.

758
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:23,333
This is a fake

759
01:05:24,212 --> 01:05:26,203
Aryan Khanna is a fake.

760
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:30,340
I want a refund. Aryan Khanna
is a fake.

761
01:05:32,679 --> 01:05:35,091
This isn't right. You can't do this
to our property.

762
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:38,348
The white man claims
my face is his property.

763
01:05:39,269 --> 01:05:41,681
Mr. Property Agent. This is me.

764
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:43,812
My face, my property.

765
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:47,057
- Stop now and leave, sir.
- I won't leave.

766
01:05:51,322 --> 01:05:53,279
It's a joke. You guys can't
take a joke.

767
01:05:59,664 --> 01:06:00,699
Come here. Come.

768
01:06:00,832 --> 01:06:02,322
Who can stop me?

769
01:06:03,293 --> 01:06:04,704
I'll shoot you all.

770
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:08,085
I don't understand what
you're talking about.

771
01:06:08,465 --> 01:06:09,705
You are gonna be in a lot
of trouble over this.

772
01:06:09,841 --> 01:06:10,455
Really?

773
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:15,127
You are in trouble too.

774
01:06:16,723 --> 01:06:18,714
Stay out of my way! I'll shoot.

775
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:27,639
You alright?

776
01:07:15,657 --> 01:07:16,897
Aryan...

777
01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:20,984
What?

778
01:07:21,246 --> 01:07:22,031
Come out.

779
01:07:22,330 --> 01:07:23,365
What are you saying?

780
01:07:27,961 --> 01:07:29,372
Arrest warrant for you.

781
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:32,750
What the hell is this?

782
01:07:33,091 --> 01:07:34,957
I didn't go to Madame Tussauds.

783
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:38,756
- The Indian Ambassador on line.
- I'm not talking to any Ambassador

784
01:07:39,264 --> 01:07:40,379
I'm here to arrest him.

785
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:42,801
Sir, Mr. Khanna did not go to
Madame Tussauds...

786
01:07:43,017 --> 01:07:44,849
Are you Mr. Khanna?

787
01:07:45,228 --> 01:07:47,060
Then just shut up and let me
do my job.

788
01:07:47,272 --> 01:07:50,390
Excuse me. So you are doing
your job and we are faffing?

789
01:07:51,025 --> 01:07:54,063
Must say you have a very polite way
of talking to women, Mr. Duncan.

790
01:07:54,696 --> 01:07:55,356
Guess what?

791
01:07:55,530 --> 01:07:57,567
It's my turn to be polite now.

792
01:07:58,283 --> 01:08:00,115
This, sir, is nonsense.

793
01:08:02,203 --> 01:08:04,786
Where were you between
10 and 10.30 this morning?

794
01:08:04,956 --> 01:08:06,492
- I was at home.
- And who were you with?

795
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:08,330
I was alone.

796
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:10,583
Did anyone see you at home?

797
01:08:11,713 --> 01:08:12,953
I just told you I was alone

798
01:08:13,214 --> 01:08:14,545
Aryan, I'll call our lawyer.

799
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:18,004
Can you talk in a language
we all can understand?

800
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:20,760
Let me translate it in a language
you understand.

801
01:08:21,806 --> 01:08:22,466
Lawyer.

802
01:08:23,224 --> 01:08:24,339
Two options.

803
01:08:24,892 --> 01:08:28,135
Handcuffs if you are nasty,
without handcuffs if you are nice.

804
01:08:35,278 --> 01:08:35,983
Nasty.

805
01:09:12,231 --> 01:09:13,687
Just five minutes.

806
01:09:14,025 --> 01:09:15,015
You stay here.

807
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:16,599
Just five minutes sir, please.

808
01:09:18,071 --> 01:09:19,527
Let's call Akhtar.

809
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:41,173
What happened?

810
01:09:42,303 --> 01:09:43,338
Lost your funny bone?

811
01:09:45,515 --> 01:09:46,255
That's not me.

812
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:48,882
Behaves like you.

813
01:09:50,353 --> 01:09:51,559
Looks like you.

814
01:09:52,814 --> 01:09:55,397
Everybody calls this person
by your name.

815
01:09:58,653 --> 01:10:00,235
I said that's not me.

816
01:10:01,239 --> 01:10:02,229
You have any proof?

817
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:07,697
Say something, Mr. Superstar.

818
01:10:09,997 --> 01:10:11,829
Not to you, Mr. Small-Time cop.

819
01:10:12,542 --> 01:10:14,078
Not a word without my lawyer.

820
01:10:15,128 --> 01:10:15,993
Suit yourself

821
01:10:16,921 --> 01:10:19,288
24 hrs remand for Mr. Khanna.

822
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:21,373
Till he comes out with the truth.

823
01:10:22,176 --> 01:10:24,463
- You can't do that.
- Sure, I can.

824
01:10:32,603 --> 01:10:34,640
Sir, one photograph please?

825
01:10:41,529 --> 01:10:43,736
- You have a safe trip, sir.
- Yeah, I will be.

826
01:11:52,183 --> 01:11:53,423
It's time. Lets go.

827
01:12:05,905 --> 01:12:08,522
DUBROVNIK

828
01:12:15,706 --> 01:12:17,663
In Croatian, we say - How are you?

829
01:12:19,877 --> 01:12:20,787
I'm fine.

830
01:12:21,671 --> 01:12:22,911
My name is Gaurav.

831
01:12:27,844 --> 01:12:29,300
Thank you.

832
01:12:35,852 --> 01:12:37,013
Vegetable sandwich... one.

833
01:12:37,311 --> 01:12:38,551
Which one do you want?

834
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:39,726
This one?

835
01:12:39,897 --> 01:12:41,479
OK. Here we go.

836
01:12:45,945 --> 01:12:48,027
No, no, more. Six more.

837
01:12:50,157 --> 01:12:51,773
It's OK. Here.

838
01:12:54,328 --> 01:12:55,193
Thank you.

839
01:12:58,249 --> 01:12:59,114
Thanks.

840
01:13:29,864 --> 01:13:30,729
It's only bail.

841
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:33,439
We know you're lying.

842
01:13:33,784 --> 01:13:35,695
Why would I waste my lies on you?

843
01:13:36,746 --> 01:13:39,613
That was no imposter.
You twisted psycho.

844
01:13:40,041 --> 01:13:41,577
We'll have you back
in jail in no time.

845
01:13:41,751 --> 01:13:43,162
Please do that.

846
01:13:43,502 --> 01:13:45,994
Maybe I'll earn some money suing you
and the entire British police

847
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:49,088
Aryan, control your temper.

848
01:13:49,717 --> 01:13:51,674
It's their city, their country.

849
01:13:52,887 --> 01:13:55,504
Don't make matters worse
for yourself.

850
01:13:55,973 --> 01:13:58,305
So we're done with all
the formalities?

851
01:13:59,352 --> 01:14:00,183
Thanks a lot.

852
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:02,681
Pathetic fool

853
01:14:03,648 --> 01:14:07,141
I'm coming with you to Dubrovnik
in case of any immigration problem.

854
01:14:07,652 --> 01:14:09,188
Hey! Not that way.

855
01:14:10,237 --> 01:14:11,568
<i>The press is outside</i>

856
01:14:14,659 --> 01:14:16,775
Aryan, this is Deputy High
Commissioner, Mr. Murthy.

857
01:14:17,161 --> 01:14:18,743
Pleased to meet you.

858
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:20,912
Sorry you had to go through
all this but...

859
01:14:21,082 --> 01:14:22,868
We can't interfere very much.

860
01:14:23,209 --> 01:14:24,665
This is a foreign country after all

861
01:14:25,002 --> 01:14:27,835
I know. Rules in every country
are made to get the innocent.

862
01:14:28,589 --> 01:14:30,956
Sir, we're diplomats, not detectives.

863
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:34,835
Before the case is solved, we have
permission for you to travel.

864
01:14:35,179 --> 01:14:36,761
Now we can only do that much.

865
01:14:37,056 --> 01:14:39,423
It's a serious matter.
A diplomatic issue.

866
01:14:39,684 --> 01:14:43,052
So you must prove it wasn't you
at Madame Tussauds.

867
01:14:43,437 --> 01:14:46,395
Must I prove it? OK, I'll play cop.

868
01:14:47,066 --> 01:14:49,307
I really appreciate your help.

869
01:14:49,986 --> 01:14:50,691
Thank you.

870
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:52,776
Thank you, sir.

871
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:57,482
In jail or dancing at a wedding...

872
01:14:57,660 --> 01:14:59,742
these stars are so arrogant.

873
01:15:02,415 --> 01:15:05,578
Your home CCTV footage has saved us.
It's with the police.

874
01:15:05,793 --> 01:15:09,832
It proves an impostor was at Madame
Tussauds and you were at home.

875
01:15:10,589 --> 01:15:13,001
Who is he? What's his motive.

876
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:14,540
Forget the London cops.

877
01:15:14,802 --> 01:15:16,668
Find out. We need to get this guy.

878
01:15:17,805 --> 01:15:19,887
We'll know more back in London.

879
01:15:20,683 --> 01:15:22,048
So you know you can
really relax now.

880
01:15:22,226 --> 01:15:23,808
Wine? Champagne? Anything?

881
01:15:24,603 --> 01:15:25,138
Everything.

882
01:15:25,396 --> 01:15:26,932
Come on, Aryan. It's over now.

883
01:15:27,273 --> 01:15:29,059
Sir, a call.

884
01:15:29,275 --> 01:15:32,438
He says he knows the imposter
at Madame Tussauds.

885
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:35,858
- Give me the phone. I'll talk.
- He'll only talk to sir.

886
01:15:36,073 --> 01:15:37,404
He won't give me his name.

887
01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:39,607
Give it to me.

888
01:15:45,583 --> 01:15:46,197
Hello.

889
01:15:54,008 --> 01:15:54,839
Senior

890
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:01,296
Chandna?

891
01:16:02,475 --> 01:16:04,341
I won't let you forget my name.

892
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:06,801
It'll be taken in the same breath
as your name.

893
01:16:07,772 --> 01:16:08,557
What do you want?

894
01:16:08,773 --> 01:16:10,104
The stage is set.

895
01:16:10,608 --> 01:16:13,726
Tell everyone - admit what you did
was wrong.

896
01:16:14,487 --> 01:16:17,400
You'll never break a fan's heart
again. Say sorry.

897
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:20,402
Stop this nonsense! I'm not
apologizing to anyone.

898
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:23,405
I tried to make you see sense.

899
01:16:23,704 --> 01:16:26,321
If you had agreed to give me
5 minutes.

900
01:16:26,999 --> 01:16:28,785
I would have my life.
You would have yours.

901
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:31,709
But you had to prove you had
star power.

902
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:33,290
Now you'll see a fan's power

903
01:16:33,506 --> 01:16:34,462
I'm a star.

904
01:16:35,174 --> 01:16:38,166
I took your pranks as childishness.
Threw you inside for only 2 days.

905
01:16:39,136 --> 01:16:41,548
If l knew the real you,
you'd still be inside.

906
01:16:41,847 --> 01:16:45,135
In 48 hours you snatched away
my devotion of 25 years.

907
01:16:46,143 --> 01:16:47,884
If you don't say sorry...

908
01:16:48,354 --> 01:16:50,436
in the next 48 hours,
your stardom is over.

909
01:16:51,273 --> 01:16:52,513
Do what you want

910
01:16:53,734 --> 01:16:55,691
I've seen off dozens like you.

911
01:16:56,112 --> 01:16:59,355
The higher you fly, the harder
I'll make you fall.

912
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:04,241
But you must fly as high as me,
Gaurav Chandna.

913
01:17:04,537 --> 01:17:06,198
Impossible for you.

914
01:17:07,748 --> 01:17:11,582
We'll see how far you get
impersonating me.

915
01:17:12,002 --> 01:17:14,334
I don't need to go far.

916
01:17:15,005 --> 01:17:17,838
You're getting closer to me.
In Dubrovnik.

917
01:17:21,929 --> 01:17:24,170
Idiot. He's in Dubrovnik.

918
01:17:28,686 --> 01:17:30,677
Unknown caller, unknown location.

919
01:17:31,188 --> 01:17:34,806
Obviously, Sunaina. He won't
call from a traceable number.

920
01:17:38,154 --> 01:17:40,441
Say sorry. It's no big deal.

921
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:44,573
He's mad

922
01:17:44,869 --> 01:17:47,406
ls that so? And what am I?

923
01:17:52,084 --> 01:17:53,199
ls the make-up team in place?

924
01:17:53,377 --> 01:17:54,993
They are on there way.

925
01:17:55,254 --> 01:17:58,337
Oh great. The props, fireworks,
confetti all that.

926
01:17:58,716 --> 01:18:00,753
We've done a couple of rehearsals.
Everything's perfect.

927
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:02,171
OK. Thank you

928
01:18:03,262 --> 01:18:05,378
Aryan asked for a background
check of all the staff members

929
01:18:05,639 --> 01:18:07,221
- ls it done yet?
- It's going on right now.

930
01:18:07,474 --> 01:18:08,430
OK. Thank you

931
01:18:12,396 --> 01:18:13,682
Nicksi Jelopera.

932
01:18:27,369 --> 01:18:28,734
- Medium?
- Medium size.

933
01:19:14,375 --> 01:19:17,242
You're so late, Aryan Khanna.
It's just not done

934
01:19:17,544 --> 01:19:19,876
I apologise. I'm extremely sorry,
Mr. Bhutiani

935
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:21,620
I had a crisis, I'm sorry.

936
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:24,753
You celebrities always have
some crisis.

937
01:19:25,177 --> 01:19:27,168
But my daughter doesn't
get married everyday

938
01:19:27,388 --> 01:19:29,345
- I know. I'm sorry.
- You've no idea.

939
01:19:29,598 --> 01:19:33,512
That stunt you pulled in London has
caused me great loss of face.

940
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:34,930
No, Mr. Bhutiani.

941
01:19:35,271 --> 01:19:37,353
What happened at Madame Tussauds...

942
01:19:38,565 --> 01:19:40,522
You know what? I'll make
it up to you

943
01:19:40,734 --> 01:19:44,318
I swear. Your guests will always think
of the grand Bhutiani wedding.

944
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:45,819
They better do.

945
01:19:46,115 --> 01:19:47,947
After all I'm spending
a bomb on you.

946
01:19:51,161 --> 01:19:53,528
Only you can. I'll get ready

947
01:19:55,165 --> 01:19:57,623
Sunaina, find out where
the CCTV cameras are

948
01:19:57,876 --> 01:20:01,244
Usman, watch the guest areas,
the bars, the toilets, the corridors.

949
01:20:01,588 --> 01:20:03,750
- Keep an eye on everyone.
- Excuse me, sir

950
01:20:04,008 --> 01:20:06,375
I'm really sorry to interrupt but
we just have 2 minutes.

951
01:20:06,969 --> 01:20:09,336
I don't need two, darling.
Let's go, I'm ready.

952
01:20:10,139 --> 01:20:11,174
Good luck.

953
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:13,013
Payal, tell me the names

954
01:20:13,267 --> 01:20:15,429
ls Bhutiani's son-in-law called
Amul Mirchandani?

955
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:16,884
It's Anmol Mirchandani.

956
01:20:17,104 --> 01:20:19,015
Guys, all the best. Break
a leg and do well.

957
01:20:19,148 --> 01:20:21,139
And sisters Anushka, Deepshika?

958
01:20:21,525 --> 01:20:23,732
That's for later, it's all here.

959
01:20:24,987 --> 01:20:26,898
Second entry dance 5,6,7,8.
You're giving it to me.

960
01:20:27,114 --> 01:20:28,730
- Sir, your shades.
- Thank you, Payal.

961
01:20:28,907 --> 01:20:30,864
OK guys. You have 30 seconds
to go.

962
01:20:31,118 --> 01:20:32,654
All the best, just kill it.

963
01:21:17,748 --> 01:21:19,409
Check all entries and exits.

964
01:21:19,958 --> 01:21:20,948
OK, Sunaina.

965
01:21:33,639 --> 01:21:34,595
Find anything?

966
01:21:34,765 --> 01:21:38,554
Not yet, sir. I've spoken to the team,
no one enters without an invite.

967
01:21:38,769 --> 01:21:40,305
Sir, your cue cards

968
01:21:40,562 --> 01:21:41,848
15 secs to go.

969
01:21:43,232 --> 01:21:44,017
Can you go to cam 4.

970
01:21:48,362 --> 01:21:50,569
When you count the night stars...

971
01:21:50,864 --> 01:21:52,946
and yearn to etch her name
on every star.

972
01:21:53,492 --> 01:21:54,948
You know you're in love.

973
01:21:55,244 --> 01:21:57,451
When you want to turn back
as you walk ahead.

974
01:21:57,830 --> 01:22:01,744
When you look for her in a crowd,
you know you're in love.

975
01:22:04,670 --> 01:22:06,252
“Say sorry".

976
01:22:09,216 --> 01:22:10,672
Check the crew's photos.

977
01:22:11,093 --> 01:22:13,585
He's not a guest. He's crew.
Quick.

978
01:22:13,887 --> 01:22:14,547
Got it.

979
01:22:18,767 --> 01:22:19,552
Sorry.

980
01:22:32,823 --> 01:22:33,563
There. Zoom in.

981
01:22:34,741 --> 01:22:37,108
Check the crew backstage.

982
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:38,199
COPY

983
01:22:38,495 --> 01:22:41,829
Payal, we need the crew ids.
Photographs and bio-datas.

984
01:22:42,249 --> 01:22:44,957
- Anything serious, sir?
- Aryan wants to know.

985
01:22:58,182 --> 01:22:59,172
Sorry.

986
01:22:59,349 --> 01:22:59,963
It's fine.

987
01:23:03,353 --> 01:23:05,060
The crew is local.

988
01:23:05,272 --> 01:23:08,230
Except one guy. Half Indian,
half Croatian

989
01:23:10,611 --> 01:23:12,818
Akhtar is sending you a photo
of him.

990
01:23:13,322 --> 01:23:14,528
Keep a close eye.

991
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:20,905
Round up all the crew.

992
01:23:51,068 --> 01:23:53,059
- Any sign of him?
- Sir, nothing.

993
01:23:53,362 --> 01:23:54,818
He's not responding

994
01:23:55,322 --> 01:23:55,857
Sunaina.

995
01:23:56,156 --> 01:23:57,646
Can't see him on any camera.

996
01:23:58,075 --> 01:23:59,657
- But I'm at it.
- What are you at it?

997
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:08,078
Where is there no CCTV camera?

998
01:24:09,002 --> 01:24:10,208
Your make-up room.

999
01:24:19,304 --> 01:24:20,135
Careful, sir.

1000
01:24:38,824 --> 01:24:41,191
“Gaurav makes Aryan".

1001
01:24:52,337 --> 01:24:54,920
You're very stubborn.
You don't listen to me.

1002
01:24:55,507 --> 01:24:58,545
Why are you hiding?
Talk face-to-face.

1003
01:24:59,219 --> 01:25:01,256
I stand face-to-face, Aryan Khanna.

1004
01:25:02,306 --> 01:25:04,263
But you never see me.

1005
01:25:04,933 --> 01:25:08,767
Now when I'm not there, you're
longing to see me.

1006
01:25:10,314 --> 01:25:12,305
I know the feeling.

1007
01:25:12,816 --> 01:25:15,057
I felt it among the crowd
in front of your house.

1008
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:24,533
Sir, the Bhutianis are waiting.
The audience interaction...

1009
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:27,987
Yeah. I'm coming.

1010
01:25:28,957 --> 01:25:30,743
- I'll take care of it.
- Thank you

1011
01:25:33,337 --> 01:25:35,419
I'll come back and see you.
Hi sweetheart.

1012
01:25:35,839 --> 01:25:37,125
Hope you enjoyed the show.

1013
01:25:37,466 --> 01:25:39,457
- Aryan, it was marvelous.
- Thank you.

1014
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:41,003
That's my daughter.

1015
01:25:41,178 --> 01:25:44,546
She's been practicing a step to
dance with you for two months.

1016
01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:46,676
Actually we were both practicing.

1017
01:25:46,892 --> 01:25:48,257
How pretty is she.

1018
01:25:48,477 --> 01:25:50,434
You know what? Let me start
with the young one

1019
01:25:50,562 --> 01:25:52,144
and I'll come back
for the experience.

1020
01:26:16,546 --> 01:26:17,832
We've found Chandna.

1021
01:26:18,131 --> 01:26:21,249
In the corridor, across from where
you're dancing

1022
01:26:21,927 --> 01:26:23,133
I'm not dancing

1023
01:26:24,096 --> 01:26:25,382
Chandna is on the dance floor.

1024
01:27:15,355 --> 01:27:17,016
What the hell is wrong with him?

1025
01:27:17,482 --> 01:27:21,100
I was dancing. He started touching me
here, there, everywhere.

1026
01:27:21,653 --> 01:27:23,235
I don't know. You'll have
to do something.

1027
01:27:23,488 --> 01:27:25,399
- Get him out.
- I don't care.

1028
01:27:36,835 --> 01:27:37,996
What the hell are you doing?

1029
01:27:38,253 --> 01:27:39,038
Mr. Bhutiani?

1030
01:27:39,171 --> 01:27:41,412
- Where do you think you are?
- Calm down, Mr. Bhutiani.

1031
01:27:41,548 --> 01:27:43,789
- What happened?
- That girl is like my daughter

1032
01:27:45,469 --> 01:27:47,335
ls this how you film stars behave?

1033
01:27:47,512 --> 01:27:49,753
I'm really sorry, ladies.
I'm sorry

1034
01:27:49,973 --> 01:27:52,931
I'll explain. The guy who was
here wasn't me.

1035
01:27:53,435 --> 01:27:55,142
- Nonsense.
- It was somebody else

1036
01:27:55,312 --> 01:27:56,552
I'm Aryan Khanna.

1037
01:27:57,022 --> 01:27:58,729
- I'm Aryan Khanna.
- What nonsense!

1038
01:27:58,899 --> 01:28:00,435
You known me for years

1039
01:28:00,609 --> 01:28:03,351
I love you guys. I'd never
harm you people.

1040
01:28:03,570 --> 01:28:05,527
That person wasn't me.

1041
01:28:07,115 --> 01:28:08,856
I suggest you leave.

1042
01:28:22,631 --> 01:28:23,917
Keep back!

1043
01:28:34,851 --> 01:28:35,465
Stop the car!

1044
01:33:56,881 --> 01:33:59,248
No one has given me the
interaction script

1045
01:34:00,343 --> 01:34:03,506
15 minutes to show time.
ls there a delay?

1046
01:34:08,059 --> 01:34:08,924
What?

1047
01:34:15,775 --> 01:34:17,231
The show's canceled.

1048
01:34:18,444 --> 01:34:22,403
They've boycotted the show.

1049
01:34:23,992 --> 01:34:26,450
Sponsors have also pulled out.

1050
01:34:28,955 --> 01:34:31,538
Nobody came, not a soul.

1051
01:35:42,862 --> 01:35:43,852
Whats wrong with you?

1052
01:35:44,030 --> 01:35:44,644
You wimp.

1053
01:35:44,822 --> 01:35:45,983
Watch where you're going?

1054
01:35:59,087 --> 01:36:00,873
Media playing up the story.

1055
01:36:01,464 --> 01:36:02,795
The wedding video has gone viral.

1056
01:36:19,649 --> 01:36:23,358
“Given Khanna's status, he must
take responsibility for his actions

1057
01:36:23,778 --> 01:36:25,143
“ls he attention-seeking?

1058
01:36:25,363 --> 01:36:27,821
“Movie stars forget that one day
they'll be has-beens.

1059
01:36:27,991 --> 01:36:30,824
“Stars must go through traumas.
Look at what his done.

1060
01:36:31,119 --> 01:36:33,110
“It's a crime if an ordinary man
misbehaves...

1061
01:36:33,329 --> 01:36:36,071
“...if it's a star - it's a stunt.
Why these double standards...

1062
01:36:36,332 --> 01:36:38,915
“...for stars? A criminal is
a criminal".

1063
01:36:48,553 --> 01:36:49,088
Hello.

1064
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:52,216
Hello, sir. It's me, Aryan.
I'm calling from London.

1065
01:36:52,890 --> 01:36:55,473
I know you are in London,
but what's going on?

1066
01:36:57,145 --> 01:37:00,012
A Delhi boy is impersonating me,
committing crimes.

1067
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:01,680
We have to arrest him.

1068
01:37:01,941 --> 01:37:05,059
But the crimes are committed
outside of India.

1069
01:37:05,653 --> 01:37:08,520
We can't arrest him. It's not
in our jurisdiction.

1070
01:37:08,906 --> 01:37:11,273
Must we wait till he commits
a crime in India?

1071
01:37:12,327 --> 01:37:13,783
His name is Gaurav Chandna.

1072
01:37:13,953 --> 01:37:16,536
Find me his Delhi address.
It will help.

1073
01:37:17,415 --> 01:37:19,076
You don't teach me my job.

1074
01:37:19,792 --> 01:37:22,955
But who shall we arrest?
You're the accused, Aryan.

1075
01:37:23,755 --> 01:37:25,416
I just...

1076
01:37:25,798 --> 01:37:27,459
Come back to India.

1077
01:37:28,301 --> 01:37:31,134
Then we'll look into the matter with
the proper procedure. OK?

1078
01:37:33,806 --> 01:37:34,591
Hello.

1079
01:37:38,144 --> 01:37:39,225
What did he say?

1080
01:37:42,273 --> 01:37:44,184
Organise a press conference
first thing tomorrow.

1081
01:37:44,692 --> 01:37:47,309
- In Mumbai?
- No, here in London.

1082
01:37:50,823 --> 01:37:56,318
You now have the video footage
and all the documents, etc.

1083
01:37:57,121 --> 01:37:58,828
You have proof...

1084
01:37:59,374 --> 01:38:03,242
that Aryan Khanna did not
commit these crimes.

1085
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:16,304
You're angry with me, and you
have the right to be.

1086
01:38:17,433 --> 01:38:18,548
But believe me.

1087
01:38:19,227 --> 01:38:22,060
That dangerous and evil face
you see on TV is not me.

1088
01:38:22,688 --> 01:38:24,144
That person is not me.

1089
01:38:24,357 --> 01:38:25,438
So please give me time.

1090
01:38:25,608 --> 01:38:29,317
Time, so that I can prove
I've done nothing wrong

1091
01:38:31,114 --> 01:38:34,072
I'd never do anything that
would make you ashamed...

1092
01:38:34,409 --> 01:38:35,899
to call me your star.

1093
01:38:36,619 --> 01:38:37,984
Whatever I am...

1094
01:38:42,333 --> 01:38:46,076
I just want to say, I would
never do anything like this.

1095
01:38:47,088 --> 01:38:47,953
Thank you.

1096
01:38:50,133 --> 01:38:54,127
Sir, do you know this impostor?
Have you met him?

1097
01:38:54,595 --> 01:38:58,429
Sorry. We can't talk now.
The case is under trial.

1098
01:38:58,641 --> 01:39:00,006
What about the imposter's name?

1099
01:39:00,351 --> 01:39:03,184
As soon as we have proof,
you'll be the first to know.

1100
01:39:03,980 --> 01:39:06,472
Are you the real Aryan Khanna
or the imposter?

1101
01:39:10,445 --> 01:39:12,482
You find this funny? A big joke?

1102
01:39:14,157 --> 01:39:17,946
If this happened to a girl in your
family would you still be grinning?

1103
01:39:19,787 --> 01:39:23,155
A woman was molested and
you find it's funny?

1104
01:39:24,667 --> 01:39:25,782
And one more thing.

1105
01:39:26,919 --> 01:39:29,707
This press meet is not
to prove my innocence.

1106
01:39:30,506 --> 01:39:32,338
I want to warn you all.

1107
01:39:33,468 --> 01:39:36,506
The man who's impersonating me,
spoiling my name.

1108
01:39:37,054 --> 01:39:39,637
He can hurt anyone, anytime.

1109
01:39:40,433 --> 01:39:41,548
So please be careful.

1110
01:39:43,644 --> 01:39:45,134
Thank you everybody.
Thanks for coming

1111
01:39:45,396 --> 01:39:47,763
Aryan has a flight to catch, he's
going back to India.

1112
01:39:47,982 --> 01:39:49,564
So have a great day and
see you soon.

1113
01:39:50,151 --> 01:39:52,392
MUMBAI

1114
01:40:03,956 --> 01:40:06,823
Don't stop, go from behind.

1115
01:40:17,053 --> 01:40:17,963
Open up!

1116
01:40:20,097 --> 01:40:22,964
One minute, sir. Madam said we must
inform her.

1117
01:40:23,392 --> 01:40:24,757
Good. Hurry up.

1118
01:40:24,977 --> 01:40:26,843
Before the journalists outside mob me.

1119
01:40:32,485 --> 01:40:32,974
Hello.

1120
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:35,018
Ma'am, can sir come in?

1121
01:40:38,449 --> 01:40:39,655
No, wait a second.

1122
01:40:41,661 --> 01:40:44,653
- Are you sure it's him?
- It sounds like sir.

1123
01:40:45,706 --> 01:40:47,242
Ask him to face the camera.

1124
01:40:48,751 --> 01:40:50,867
Sir, ma'am wants you to step forward.

1125
01:40:56,842 --> 01:41:00,380
Hi, I am Aryan Khanna. Height 5'10.
Black hair, black eyes.

1126
01:41:00,763 --> 01:41:01,924
A big nose.

1127
01:41:02,098 --> 01:41:03,805
School: Kendriya Vidyalaya,
New Delhi.

1128
01:41:04,559 --> 01:41:06,721
Hans Raj College, Delhi University.

1129
01:41:08,271 --> 01:41:09,932
Give me the phone, quick!

1130
01:41:11,816 --> 01:41:13,477
The press will surround me.

1131
01:41:14,819 --> 01:41:17,311
Let me in. Or I'll end up
in their arms.

1132
01:41:17,572 --> 01:41:18,937
Why is your phone off?

1133
01:41:20,199 --> 01:41:21,985
Can I tell you inside?

1134
01:41:24,870 --> 01:41:25,905
Open the door.

1135
01:41:35,923 --> 01:41:38,085
Guys. Dad's here

1136
01:42:04,660 --> 01:42:06,321
Aryan, you're back?

1137
01:42:18,758 --> 01:42:20,169
- Hi.
- Hi.

1138
01:42:20,843 --> 01:42:23,255
- You're back.
- Yes, I'm back.

1139
01:42:25,806 --> 01:42:26,921
Are the kids asleep?

1140
01:42:32,229 --> 01:42:34,641
Yes. It's way past their bedtime.

1141
01:42:35,149 --> 01:42:36,731
Of course.

1142
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:38,976
Let them sleep.

1143
01:42:40,363 --> 01:42:44,152
Let's relax and talk quietly
in our room.

1144
01:42:48,663 --> 01:42:49,494
YES

1145
01:42:55,670 --> 01:42:59,914
- What an entrance exam!
- You passed with flying colours

1146
01:43:00,257 --> 01:43:02,624
I spent my life preparing
for this moment.

1147
01:43:03,135 --> 01:43:05,672
Relax. Make yourself a drink.
I'll run the shower for you.

1148
01:43:05,971 --> 01:43:07,336
Of course.

1149
01:43:22,530 --> 01:43:26,023
She was crying. Not easy getting
her to sleep again.

1150
01:43:30,913 --> 01:43:34,156
It's better for us both if lsha
stays asleep.

1151
01:43:41,048 --> 01:43:42,334
I did say...

1152
01:43:43,551 --> 01:43:45,713
we could talk calmly.

1153
01:43:47,888 --> 01:43:49,128
Why do you need that?

1154
01:43:49,765 --> 01:43:50,721
Give.

1155
01:43:51,517 --> 01:43:55,101
I have nothing against you
or your children.

1156
01:43:56,731 --> 01:43:57,766
Give me that.

1157
01:44:00,818 --> 01:44:02,434
Senior ignores me.

1158
01:44:03,821 --> 01:44:05,528
You can't let him do that.

1159
01:44:07,700 --> 01:44:11,659
Show me Aryan's study, he's
always talking about it.

1160
01:44:15,249 --> 01:44:16,364
Sound asleep.

1161
01:44:17,501 --> 01:44:18,866
<i>Come, come.</i>

1162
01:44:27,261 --> 01:44:29,923
Sit. He lands in 20 minutes.
I haven't much time.

1163
01:44:30,639 --> 01:44:32,175
Come on, sit down.

1164
01:44:37,229 --> 01:44:39,220
This room has so many stories.

1165
01:44:41,734 --> 01:44:43,850
Many stories behind these awards.

1166
01:44:45,154 --> 01:44:46,644
In these costumes.

1167
01:44:48,491 --> 01:44:50,858
Days that Aryan does not want
to forget.

1168
01:44:51,744 --> 01:44:55,282
Memories he wants to keep close
to his heart.

1169
01:45:01,462 --> 01:45:03,874
I treasured his memories too.

1170
01:45:04,882 --> 01:45:07,670
Kept them right here.

1171
01:45:10,513 --> 01:45:14,598
At home, on the walls of my room,
in cupboards.

1172
01:45:15,351 --> 01:45:16,933
On shelves like these

1173
01:45:26,278 --> 01:45:29,691
Aryan Khanna filled every corner
of my life.

1174
01:45:31,367 --> 01:45:32,949
But he ended it all.

1175
01:45:33,327 --> 01:45:36,911
Five minutes! I asked him for
only five minutes.

1176
01:45:37,331 --> 01:45:39,914
Know what he said?
“It's my life.

1177
01:45:40,251 --> 01:45:42,288
Why must I give you even
five seconds of it?”

1178
01:45:47,216 --> 01:45:50,129
- I apologise on his behalf.
- Why should you apologise?

1179
01:45:51,595 --> 01:45:53,632
I hit Sid Kapoor for his sake.

1180
01:45:54,598 --> 01:45:56,088
He was hassling Aryan.

1181
01:45:57,017 --> 01:45:59,679
What did Aryan do? Threw me in jail.
Had me beaten.

1182
01:46:01,063 --> 01:46:05,557
Said: “It's a crime!” A crime?

1183
01:46:07,486 --> 01:46:09,022
Crime is what I'll do now.

1184
01:46:11,240 --> 01:46:14,983
Breaking hearts of fans who are
devoted to you...

1185
01:46:15,703 --> 01:46:17,319
is a crime too.

1186
01:46:21,166 --> 01:46:22,452
You tell me.

1187
01:46:23,711 --> 01:46:25,372
Am I so wrong?

1188
01:46:26,714 --> 01:46:30,252
When he fights with you,
doesn't he say sorry?

1189
01:46:32,845 --> 01:46:35,712
So, why can't he say sorry to me?
Tell me!

1190
01:46:36,056 --> 01:46:38,218
Don't do this. I beg you.

1191
01:46:38,434 --> 01:46:40,266
What do you mean “please”?

1192
01:46:41,478 --> 01:46:43,810
He left nothing for me. Why must
I leave anything for him?

1193
01:46:44,148 --> 01:46:46,105
How can l? Impossible.

1194
01:46:47,359 --> 01:46:49,066
A sham. All lies.

1195
01:46:50,154 --> 01:46:52,691
Liar. He's a fake.

1196
01:46:54,283 --> 01:46:55,865
The rascal acts all the time.

1197
01:46:57,244 --> 01:46:58,700
An actor after all.

1198
01:47:07,463 --> 01:47:09,420
I wanted to give him my trophy.

1199
01:47:14,970 --> 01:47:17,052
A belated happy birthday,
Aryan Khanna.

1200
01:47:38,744 --> 01:47:39,905
Open the door!

1201
01:47:57,638 --> 01:47:59,925
I sent the children to my parents.

1202
01:48:01,100 --> 01:48:04,638
They were terrified. I didn't know
what to tell them

1203
01:48:05,813 --> 01:48:08,771
lsha asked me repeatedly: “Why did
Papa destroy the study?

1204
01:48:10,651 --> 01:48:11,231
Don't worry. It's OK.

1205
01:48:11,443 --> 01:48:14,856
- Why don't we call the police?
- The police will do nothing.

1206
01:48:15,698 --> 01:48:18,030
They'll ask for proof. They believe
I'm the criminal.

1207
01:48:19,451 --> 01:48:21,943
I came this far in life
on my own steam

1208
01:48:23,288 --> 01:48:25,154
I'll handle it myself.

1209
01:48:28,585 --> 01:48:30,701
Play rough like a street hoodlum

1210
01:48:31,505 --> 01:48:33,746
I'll rip him apart. Send him back
to where he belongs

1211
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:38,585
Gaurav Chandna has seen my star face.

1212
01:48:39,930 --> 01:48:41,967
Now he'll see my real face

1213
01:48:43,559 --> 01:48:44,799
I'm a Delhi man too.

1214
01:48:46,854 --> 01:48:50,063
The dangerous and evil face
on the news is not me.

1215
01:48:50,858 --> 01:48:52,519
That person is not me.
Give me time

1216
01:48:52,943 --> 01:48:54,980
I'll prove I've done nothing wrong

1217
01:48:55,154 --> 01:48:58,772
I'd never do anything to make you
ashamed calling me your star

1218
01:48:59,116 --> 01:49:02,484
Aryan Khanna's press conference
proves that he is innocent.

1219
01:49:02,786 --> 01:49:06,404
A criminal is impersonating him
and committing crimes.

1220
01:49:06,707 --> 01:49:10,200
Who is the culprit? His name?
His whereabouts?

1221
01:49:10,461 --> 01:49:13,920
No one knows the motives
behind his terrible actions.

1222
01:49:15,632 --> 01:49:20,342
The police have informed us that
they're very hopeful...

1223
01:49:20,721 --> 01:49:23,554
this criminal will not escape them.

1224
01:49:23,974 --> 01:49:26,432
When he's arrested, he'll be
severely punished.

1225
01:49:50,751 --> 01:49:51,866
Hello, Gauru.

1226
01:49:52,961 --> 01:49:53,746
Mummy.

1227
01:49:54,379 --> 01:49:57,121
What's wrong with your phone?
Where are you, Gauru?

1228
01:49:57,591 --> 01:49:58,376
Right here

1229
01:49:59,093 --> 01:50:00,003
I'm OK.

1230
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:02,676
And you?

1231
01:50:02,888 --> 01:50:06,131
Son, come home soon.
We're in trouble.

1232
01:50:09,061 --> 01:50:12,725
You've roamed the world, now return
to your home

1233
01:50:16,902 --> 01:50:17,607
Aryan?

1234
01:50:19,446 --> 01:50:20,777
You barged into my home?

1235
01:50:21,532 --> 01:50:24,741
You can barge into mine, can't I
do the same?

1236
01:50:26,703 --> 01:50:29,286
I came here to grab your
parents by the throat.

1237
01:50:29,456 --> 01:50:31,663
To ask why they produced
a nasty son like you.

1238
01:50:32,668 --> 01:50:35,660
- But I am not a lowlife like you.
- Don't drag my parents into this.

1239
01:50:36,171 --> 01:50:37,661
They did nothing.

1240
01:50:38,590 --> 01:50:39,580
What did my kids do?

1241
01:50:40,134 --> 01:50:43,627
I went alone into your fortress.
Did you bring an army?

1242
01:50:43,929 --> 01:50:45,761
I am here alone, Gaurav Chandna.

1243
01:50:46,181 --> 01:50:49,890
No security, no secretary.
No star, no hero.

1244
01:50:50,269 --> 01:50:52,601
If you have the guts, face me.

1245
01:50:52,980 --> 01:50:54,141
Settle the score.

1246
01:50:55,816 --> 01:50:58,683
The score will only be settled
when you apologise.

1247
01:50:59,778 --> 01:51:02,770
Get on the stage at the lnder Vihar
contest and say sorry.

1248
01:51:02,990 --> 01:51:03,946
And listen...

1249
01:51:04,867 --> 01:51:07,359
If you touch my parents with
a feather even...

1250
01:51:07,953 --> 01:51:12,038
I know your mother-in-law's house,
where your children are hiding.

1251
01:51:13,250 --> 01:51:14,991
Your daughter is very cute, by God.

1252
01:51:18,881 --> 01:51:21,293
- Your son is stubborn like you.
- You rascal

1253
01:51:21,884 --> 01:51:25,627
I'll bury you in a gutter here, if you
dream of harming my kids.

1254
01:51:29,308 --> 01:51:31,049
What will my parents think?

1255
01:51:32,895 --> 01:51:34,181
Such a big star...

1256
01:51:36,315 --> 01:51:37,851
with such a foul tongue.

1257
01:51:40,694 --> 01:51:41,775
Forget it.

1258
01:51:43,113 --> 01:51:45,901
See you at the contest.

1259
01:51:48,368 --> 01:51:49,950
Your son has lost his mind.

1260
01:51:51,079 --> 01:51:54,162
- He's crossed the line.
- Our Gaurav was not like that.

1261
01:51:54,917 --> 01:51:56,999
He was a good boy.

1262
01:51:58,170 --> 01:52:00,036
He changed after meeting you.

1263
01:52:01,256 --> 01:52:03,748
What would you have lost
if you gave him 5 mins?

1264
01:52:04,051 --> 01:52:05,792
Don't blame Aryan.

1265
01:52:06,303 --> 01:52:07,418
It's our fault.

1266
01:52:08,972 --> 01:52:12,181
We let him get obsessed by
your glamorous life.

1267
01:52:13,352 --> 01:52:16,265
Not your hard slog. He would've
followed your example.

1268
01:52:16,939 --> 01:52:20,102
Worked hard and become someone.

1269
01:52:21,485 --> 01:52:25,149
Then the call center girl could've
become his girlfriend or wife.

1270
01:52:28,408 --> 01:52:29,614
He has a girlfriend?

1271
01:52:30,535 --> 01:52:33,869
A one-way romance.
Gaurav loves her but...

1272
01:52:34,081 --> 01:52:37,745
Enough. We have to accept things
the way they are.

1273
01:52:38,210 --> 01:52:42,044
- Where's the contest held?
- The other end of the colony.

1274
01:52:43,298 --> 01:52:46,416
Apologise. End this terrible situation.

1275
01:52:46,718 --> 01:52:48,174
You think I'm wrong too?

1276
01:52:48,470 --> 01:52:49,710
And I must apologise?

1277
01:52:50,222 --> 01:52:51,508
Arrest him.

1278
01:52:53,725 --> 01:52:55,716
He must be punished

1279
01:52:57,521 --> 01:53:01,264
lmprison him for years, if you must.

1280
01:53:05,445 --> 01:53:06,810
But don't beat him.

1281
01:53:07,948 --> 01:53:08,904
Please.

1282
01:54:14,931 --> 01:54:17,514
Hey Junior. Where were you?

1283
01:54:18,101 --> 01:54:20,217
- Hello Uncle, Aunty.
- Hello.

1284
01:54:20,562 --> 01:54:23,224
Have you been watching the
news on TV about Aryan?

1285
01:54:24,191 --> 01:54:25,397
Never mind

1286
01:54:25,776 --> 01:54:28,143
I have good news for you all

1287
01:54:28,612 --> 01:54:30,023
I've got my American visa

1288
01:54:30,405 --> 01:54:31,816
I knew it.

1289
01:54:34,493 --> 01:54:37,281
Why is he standing with his back
to me? It's not like him.

1290
01:54:39,122 --> 01:54:41,830
He's going on stage soon,
he's just nervous.

1291
01:54:42,042 --> 01:54:43,453
Him? And nervous?

1292
01:54:43,710 --> 01:54:46,828
Has he done anything in life
besides copying Aryan?

1293
01:54:47,631 --> 01:54:50,293
Hey Superstar, your make-up...

1294
01:54:59,684 --> 01:55:00,219
Neha.

1295
01:55:03,939 --> 01:55:05,725
I have to talk to you.

1296
01:55:08,235 --> 01:55:10,602
Super surprise!

1297
01:55:11,655 --> 01:55:14,363
Western Union - moving money
for better.

1298
01:55:14,658 --> 01:55:17,867
Now for the last act of the
Super Star competition.

1299
01:55:18,662 --> 01:55:20,494
Our favourite winner.

1300
01:55:20,914 --> 01:55:24,032
Our Junior Aryan Khanna.

1301
01:55:28,505 --> 01:55:30,246
He's a criminal!

1302
01:55:30,882 --> 01:55:32,122
Get him off the stage.

1303
01:55:42,519 --> 01:55:43,634
Calm down.

1304
01:55:43,854 --> 01:55:45,720
It's not the real Aryan Khanna.

1305
01:55:45,939 --> 01:55:48,681
It's our very own superstar...

1306
01:55:49,234 --> 01:55:50,269
Gaurav Chandna.

1307
01:55:50,485 --> 01:55:51,566
Give him a big hand!

1308
01:56:26,354 --> 01:56:29,722
I do a show for Aryan every year.

1309
01:56:30,609 --> 01:56:32,850
I know, Aunty. You cheer the loudest.

1310
01:56:34,279 --> 01:56:35,735
But this year's show...

1311
01:56:36,948 --> 01:56:38,279
The show today is for...

1312
01:56:39,868 --> 01:56:40,699
someone else.

1313
01:56:41,786 --> 01:56:44,653
The girl over there who is...

1314
01:56:45,415 --> 01:56:47,372
smiling at me. She's my friend

1315
01:56:48,627 --> 01:56:49,583
Neha!

1316
01:56:50,462 --> 01:56:51,748
Come, babes.

1317
01:56:58,345 --> 01:57:01,758
There's something I've kept
in my heart for days.

1318
01:57:05,435 --> 01:57:06,095
I love you, Neha.

1319
01:57:08,772 --> 01:57:10,854
- I love you too, Aryan.
- Not Aryan

1320
01:57:11,233 --> 01:57:13,395
Gaurav loves you

1321
01:57:15,904 --> 01:57:18,316
Gaurav loves Neha.

1322
01:57:20,408 --> 01:57:21,239
What nonsense!

1323
01:57:21,743 --> 01:57:22,448
Get lost.

1324
01:57:22,702 --> 01:57:25,194
- He's nuts.
- Thinks he's real Aryan Khanna.

1325
01:57:25,455 --> 01:57:26,160
Get him off.

1326
01:57:26,373 --> 01:57:29,616
Wait! He is talking to me.
I'll deal with it.

1327
01:57:31,962 --> 01:57:34,545
I love you!

1328
01:57:35,006 --> 01:57:37,373
Drop it. You love only Aryan.

1329
01:57:37,634 --> 01:57:39,170
He can go to hell

1330
01:57:39,469 --> 01:57:42,336
- ls that you talking?
- It's not just talk

1331
01:57:42,806 --> 01:57:43,921
I've sent him to hell.

1332
01:57:44,933 --> 01:57:47,049
I fixed Aryan Khanna for good.

1333
01:57:47,477 --> 01:57:49,809
First in London, then in Dubrovnik.

1334
01:57:50,564 --> 01:57:53,022
I made my way into his house too.

1335
01:57:55,860 --> 01:57:58,522
Smashed everything in sight.

1336
01:57:59,781 --> 01:58:02,694
If you don't believe me, read the
papers. Watch TV or the Net.

1337
01:58:03,535 --> 01:58:06,368
Your Gaurav is famous the world over

1338
01:58:07,455 --> 01:58:08,991
I'm no less than Aryan.

1339
01:58:09,499 --> 01:58:10,705
Not at all.

1340
01:58:11,960 --> 01:58:13,542
I am a star in real life.

1341
01:58:14,421 --> 01:58:17,038
Not a star. A monster.

1342
01:58:17,632 --> 01:58:18,463
What?

1343
01:58:18,758 --> 01:58:20,965
They all think you're a star.

1344
01:58:21,428 --> 01:58:23,510
While you shamed lnder Vihar.

1345
01:58:23,847 --> 01:58:24,928
Listen to her

1346
01:58:25,307 --> 01:58:27,389
I became a monster for her

1347
01:58:27,726 --> 01:58:29,308
I don't want to know a monster.

1348
01:58:29,561 --> 01:58:31,518
A monster! Forget it.

1349
01:58:31,855 --> 01:58:34,472
Take my hand and say:
“| love you too”.

1350
01:58:34,816 --> 01:58:36,022
- Let go.
- I won't

1351
01:58:58,381 --> 01:58:59,416
I'm very sorry, Neha.

1352
01:59:00,050 --> 01:59:00,755
Are you OK?

1353
01:59:01,009 --> 01:59:01,965
Thank you

1354
01:59:02,469 --> 01:59:04,881
Aryan. He's a good guy

1355
01:59:10,101 --> 01:59:10,841
Gaurav!

1356
01:59:19,653 --> 01:59:20,609
Get down!

1357
02:03:52,008 --> 02:03:53,043
Enough!

1358
02:03:54,969 --> 02:03:56,880
Enough of this game.

1359
02:03:57,972 --> 02:03:58,712
Get up!

1360
02:04:04,062 --> 02:04:05,348
I am happy in my life.

1361
02:04:06,564 --> 02:04:08,271
Can't you be happy in yours?

1362
02:04:11,736 --> 02:04:13,272
Be a good son to your parents.

1363
02:04:15,073 --> 02:04:16,859
A good friend, a good boyfriend.

1364
02:04:18,743 --> 02:04:21,201
Stop being a fan.

1365
02:04:28,378 --> 02:04:30,415
What's the difference between us?

1366
02:04:32,340 --> 02:04:34,206
I came from the same streets.

1367
02:04:34,968 --> 02:04:36,675
I had normal parents like you.

1368
02:04:37,845 --> 02:04:40,212
A regular house, regular school,
regular friends.

1369
02:04:57,365 --> 02:04:58,981
I made my way up alone.

1370
02:05:01,411 --> 02:05:02,901
Not in anyone's shadow

1371
02:05:06,124 --> 02:05:06,909
I'm human.

1372
02:05:08,793 --> 02:05:12,457
I laugh and cry, get mad like you.
I have a family. Responsibilities.

1373
02:05:13,631 --> 02:05:16,293
I don't have the time to meet
all my fans

1374
02:05:24,892 --> 02:05:26,098
I'll say it again

1375
02:05:28,271 --> 02:05:29,602
I'll forget all this.

1376
02:05:30,857 --> 02:05:31,938
You do the same.

1377
02:05:33,109 --> 02:05:33,940
Start over.

1378
02:05:35,611 --> 02:05:37,397
Not as Junior Aryan Khanna.

1379
02:05:42,076 --> 02:05:44,113
See how it feels like to be
Gaurav Chandna.

1380
02:05:48,291 --> 02:05:49,122
Come!

1381
02:05:55,256 --> 02:05:57,293
The joy of living as yourself...

1382
02:05:57,884 --> 02:06:00,216
cannot be matched by living
as another.

1383
02:06:01,637 --> 02:06:02,547
Stop now.

1384
02:06:04,891 --> 02:06:06,006
Live your life.

1385
02:06:07,226 --> 02:06:08,557
Let me live mine.

1386
02:06:17,111 --> 02:06:18,397
Where to, Senior?

1387
02:06:20,281 --> 02:06:22,864
You destroyed me and ask me
to let you live your life?

1388
02:06:27,121 --> 02:06:28,111
And my life?

1389
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,287
You took everything from me.

1390
02:06:35,463 --> 02:06:37,045
My parent's love.

1391
02:06:37,965 --> 02:06:39,501
Neha's friendship.

1392
02:06:41,844 --> 02:06:43,710
My neighbours' smiles.

1393
02:06:52,480 --> 02:06:54,847
You were my lifeline, Senior.

1394
02:06:57,777 --> 02:06:58,983
You cut the connection.

1395
02:07:00,863 --> 02:07:03,480
OK. I'll do as you say

1396
02:07:06,160 --> 02:07:07,525
I'll stop this game.

1397
02:07:12,500 --> 02:07:14,491
I can separate myself from you.

1398
02:07:17,547 --> 02:07:21,165
But you can never separate
my name from yours.

1399
02:07:27,932 --> 02:07:29,172
You said everything.

1400
02:07:32,770 --> 02:07:34,306
But you never said sorry

1401
02:07:39,485 --> 02:07:40,225
Gaurav!

1402
02:07:41,154 --> 02:07:42,235
No, Gaurav.

1403
02:07:43,364 --> 02:07:44,399
It's not over.

1404
02:07:44,866 --> 02:07:46,356
Think of your parents.

1405
02:07:48,786 --> 02:07:49,696
Stop this madness.

1406
02:08:07,388 --> 02:08:10,926
Forget it. You won't understand

1407
02:09:57,248 --> 02:10:01,242
Aryan Khanna has cleared
his name completely.

1408
02:10:01,836 --> 02:10:05,170
But lnder Vihar's Gaurav Chandna...

1409
02:10:05,631 --> 02:10:08,714
has tied his name to superstar
Aryan's name forever.

1410
02:10:09,135 --> 02:10:13,003
A wave of love greets Aryan's
on his birthday today.

1411
02:10:13,264 --> 02:10:18,134
Fans are singing his songs. They're
here in their thousands.

1412
02:10:20,062 --> 02:10:20,972
It's time.

1413
02:10:24,692 --> 02:10:26,228
Everyone is waiting
