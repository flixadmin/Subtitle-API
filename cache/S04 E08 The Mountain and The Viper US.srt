1
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:16,761
Here we are.

2
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:26,312
Ready?

3
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:33,862
"The Rains of Castamere."

4
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:35,572
You fucking deaf?

5
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:39,951
Same wrong guess every fucking time.
Listen, you cunt.

6
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:47,000
"The Bear and the Maiden Fair."

7
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,253
-Yes!
-There's a man with an ear.

8
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,173
Too bad you got a hangnail for a cock.

9
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,427
First time I saw you
with your breeches down,

10
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,720
I thought you were a eunuch.

11
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,389
You've seen it, girls.

12
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,183
Like a baby snail
peeking out of his shell.

13
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:20,533
Your baby was crying this morning.

14
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:27,790
Woke me up.

15
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:31,586
-You hear me?
-Yes.

16
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:36,507
-Well, got anything to say?
-I'm sorry he woke you up.

17
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:39,844
I don't care if you're sorry.

18
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:43,848
Keep that baby quiet, or I will.

19
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:45,683
Don't you ever touch him.

20
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:50,021
Little wildling bitch.

21
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,191
You should have stayed with your own kind.

22
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,779
-Are you listening to me?
-Shut your mouth.

23
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,489
What?

24
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:05,328
-It's just an owl, you dumb bitch.
-No, it's not.

25
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,544
Please, please. No. Please! Please!

26
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:55,980
I should never have left her there.

27
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:59,650
-You couldn't have known.
-Of course I could've known.

28
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,528
They've been raiding
the villages close by.

29
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,989
And we just cower in here
while they slaughter our brothers.

30
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,158
Our brothers had orders
to stay at Castle Black.

31
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:10,161
So, it's all right, then?
Black Jack and Kegs and Mully

32
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:11,788
chopped to pieces
'cause they broke the rules?

33
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,665
I didn't say it was all right.
I'm saying they shouldn't have been there.

34
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,293
We're pledged to guard the realms of men.

35
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:20,004
-She's dead because of me.
-We can't even guard Mole's Town.

36
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,506
We can't go after them. You know that.

37
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,466
It's what they want.

38
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:25,593
And little Sam.

39
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,346
As if I cut their throats myself.

40
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:32,100
Maybe she managed to hide herself.
I thought all of you was dead.

41
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,227
You went up north with Mormont
and no one came back.

42
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:35,812
Not for ages.

43
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:37,855
But then you did.

44
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:43,569
She survived Craster,
and he was the worst shit I've ever met.

45
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,405
She survived the long march to the Wall.

46
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:49,283
She survived a White Walker,
for fuck's sake.

47
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:52,370
She might have got out.

48
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:56,541
She might have.

49
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:02,755
If they hit Mole's Town, then we're next.

50
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:09,387
-Mance and his army must be close.
-Hundred thousand of them.

51
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,390
And there's what, 105 of us left?

52
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,976
You counting Black Jack, Kegs, and Mully?

53
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:17,562
A hundred and two.

54
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,357
How do 102 men stop 100,000?

55
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:29,615
Whoever dies last,
be a good lad and burn the rest of us.

56
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:32,118
Once I'm done with this world,

57
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,079
I don't want to come back.

58
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:40,019
-You think he was spying on you?
-No, not spying.

59
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:42,438
The Dothraki think
outsiders are ridiculous

60
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:45,650
taking shame in the naked body.
They make love under the stars

61
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:46,943
for the whole khalasar to see.

62
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:49,987
Yes, Your Grace.

63
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,657
But you are not Dothraki.

64
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:55,201
No.

65
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:59,914
Well, I don't see why it matters.
Grey Worm isn't interested.

66
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:02,750
None of the Unsullied care
what's under our clothes.

67
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,213
He was interested.

68
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:09,632
What?

69
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:14,345
I believe he was interested.

70
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:20,351
When the slavers castrate the boys,
do they take all of it?

71
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:22,562
All of it?

72
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:27,024
The pillar and the stones.

73
00:09:30,569 --> 00:09:31,487
I don't know, Your Grace.

74
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,323
Haven't you ever wondered?

75
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,204
Yes, Your Grace.

76
00:09:58,514 --> 00:09:59,432
Missandei.

77
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,200
The lessons you give I in Common Tongue...

78
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,205
these are precious to I.

79
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,333
-To me.
-To me.

80
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,210
I don't remember teaching you
the word "precious."

81
00:10:28,627 --> 00:10:31,172
Jorah the Andal, he teaches I...

82
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,592
he teaches me this word.

83
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,554
Do you remember the name
you were given at birth?

84
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,933
I remember nothing. Only Unsullied.

85
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,393
When they cut you,

86
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:47,480
do you remember that?

87
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:51,275
I'm sorry.

88
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:56,989
-I'm sorry they did that to you.
-Why? Why sorry?

89
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,533
It's a terrible thing to do to a boy.

90
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:09,460
If the masters never cut me,
I never am Unsullied.

91
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:12,671
I never stand in the Plaza of Pride

92
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:16,717
when Daenerys Stormborn orders us
to kill the masters.

93
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:20,054
I never am chosen to lead the Unsullied.

94
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:25,142
I never meet Missandei
from the island of Naath.

95
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,744
I am sorry I...

96
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:47,081
For today.

97
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:49,708
I am sorry.

98
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,006
Kraken.

99
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:41,051
Strong, as long as they're in the sea.

100
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:45,473
When you take them out of the water,
no bones.

101
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:49,435
They collapse under their proud weight
and slump into a heap of nothing.

102
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,770
You'd think they'd know that.

103
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:54,440
Unfortunately, they're not very bright.

104
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,359
What do you tell them?

105
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:03,282
I'm Theon Greyjoy, son of Balon,
heir to the Iron Islands.

106
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,618
-And what are you really?
-I'm Reek.

107
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:08,329
Are you sure?

108
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,874
You do look very much like a lord.

109
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,336
Formidable, proud.

110
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,298
-I'm Reek.
-Until when?

111
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:21,717
Always.

112
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:24,470
-Forever.
-That's right.

113
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,515
Until you're rotting in the ground.

114
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,355
Remember what you are
and what you're not.

115
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:36,774
Bring me Moat Cailin.

116
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,430
No closer!

117
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,227
Who are you?

118
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:56,437
I'm Kenning, commander of this garrison.

119
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,358
-And you say you're Theon Greyjoy?
-Yes.

120
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,070
And why should I believe that?

121
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,365
I was born on Pyke to Balon Greyjoy.

122
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:12,369
His third and last living son.
I am your prince.

123
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,872
I swear it by the Drowned God.

124
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:19,043
-What is dead may never die.
-What is dead may never die.

125
00:15:19,918 --> 00:15:24,381
And if you were my prince,
why are you marching with a Bolton army?

126
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,508
Lord Bolton took me captive
after Winterfell.

127
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,970
He has sent me to treat with you
in good faith

128
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,555
as your fellow ironborn.

129
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,182
And what does Lord Bolton want?

130
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:40,022
You are fading from sickness,
you are badly outnumbered,

131
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,857
and you're hundreds of miles from the sea.

132
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,318
Lord Bolton implores you
to protect your men,

133
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:46,820
and abandon this fortress
you can no longer hold.

134
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,114
Do this,

135
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,076
and he will be just and fair with you
as he has been with me.

136
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,082
The Boltons will give you safe passage
to the Stony Shore.

137
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,209
He wants us to surrender?

138
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:05,923
My own father, your king,
surrendered years ago to Robert Baratheon.

139
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,133
I watched him bend the knee.

140
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:12,971
There was no shame there.
He fought with honor, as did you.

141
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,353
"No shame." "Fought with honor."

142
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,230
I'm sorry, I didn't hear.

143
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:26,110
"No shame." "Fought with honor."

144
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,366
Only a whipped dog would speak this way.

145
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:35,994
Or a woman.

146
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,289
Are you a woman, boy?

147
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,001
-You don't know--
-The ironborn will not surrender.

148
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:47,339
-Reek. My name is Reek...
-You go tell your master that,

149
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:51,885
Theon Greyjoy,
or whoever the fuck you are.

150
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:55,180
-My name is Reek.
-What in the hell are you muttering?

151
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,181
I'm Reek.

152
00:16:58,475 --> 00:16:59,393
Reek.

153
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,235
If we yield, we live?

154
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,447
-Is that what it says on this paper here?
-Yes.

155
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,533
Have your men raise the white flag
and open the gates.

156
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,035
You're going home.

157
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,295
You didn't really think I'd let them go,
did you?

158
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:32,134
It's fallen out of fashion, flaying.
Sad, but true.

159
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,178
Traditions are important.

160
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,972
Where are we without our history?

161
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,516
Yes, my lord.

162
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,019
Will we go home now?

163
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:44,521
I believe we will.

164
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:46,565
To our new home.

165
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:00,162
You have foreign blood,
don't you, Baelish?

166
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,915
A great-grandfather from Braavos, yes.

167
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:08,712
I suppose all of our ancestors came
from somewhere else originally.

168
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:12,257
Our forebears settled the Vale
thousands of years ago.

169
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:14,718
We've fought off invaders ever since.

170
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,011
The beauty of the Vale is matched

171
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,514
only by the nobility
of its great families.

172
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:23,435
Lady Arryn often told me
that you were her rock, Lord Royce.

173
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,854
Well, she told me nothing about you,
Baelish.

174
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,649
But I didn't need to hear from her.

175
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,318
Moneylender. Whoremonger.

176
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:34,321
You've been licking
Tywin Lannister's boots so long,

177
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:36,198
-it's a wonder your tongue's not black.
-My lord--

178
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:39,868
And when Jon Arryn named you
Master of Coin, no one cared.

179
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:44,498
Always been a grubby job.
Why not let a grubby man do it?

180
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,917
But when I heard you were lurking here,

181
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:50,629
-fawning over the Lady Arryn--
-Lady Arryn invited me.

182
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,881
She and I have been close

183
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,717
-since childhood.
-Yes, we all know how close you were.

184
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:59,137
Lady Arryn's predilections
were her own affair.

185
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,348
-Her death is our affair.
-Of course.

186
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:04,268
Her suicide shattered us all.

187
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:07,104
She was an odd fish. Everyone knew that.

188
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:11,733
But suicide? She adored that boy of hers.

189
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,695
I don't see her abandoning him.
Not by choice.

190
00:19:15,153 --> 00:19:17,781
Strange that within days of your arrival,

191
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:22,244
you've married Lady Arryn
and she's fallen through the Moon Door.

192
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,204
She was always prone to melancholy.

193
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:27,833
My lady wasn't meant for a world
as brutal as ours.

194
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:32,337
-We were told there was a witness. A girl.
-A niece of yours, I believe.

195
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,842
A girl with no learning
and scattered wits.

196
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:39,261
-I assure you, she would be of no help.
-We'd like to speak with her.

197
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,433
-Let me fetch her.
-No need.

198
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,729
We prefer to hear her testimony
unadulterated.

199
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:00,157
Come closer, child.

200
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:03,869
You have nothing to fear from us or him.

201
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:07,205
Lord Baelish here is your uncle?

202
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:09,958
Your name is Alayne?

203
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:15,255
Perhaps you would feel more comfortable
if Lord Baelish left the room.

204
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,632
-My lady--
-I wasn't asking you.

205
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:17,758
He can stay.

206
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,718
Speak up, girl,
you're not a damn kitchen mouse.

207
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:21,053
Tell us what you saw.

208
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:26,850
I'm sorry, Lord Baelish.

209
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,186
I have to tell the truth.

210
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,817
I'll tell you everything.

211
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,821
Please, Alayne, leave nothing out.

212
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,368
My name is not Alayne.

213
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:49,373
It's Sansa Stark,
eldest daughter of Lord Eddard Stark.

214
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,751
Lord Royce, we met
when you came to Winterfell.

215
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,462
You were escorting your son
Ser Waymar to the Wall.

216
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:57,881
Sansa Stark?

217
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:02,344
You tell lies right to my face,
you little worm?

218
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:04,513
Lord Baelish has told many lies.

219
00:21:08,266 --> 00:21:09,476
All to protect me.

220
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:16,316
Since my father was executed,
I have been a hostage in King's Landing.

221
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:21,071
A plaything for Joffrey to torture,
or Queen Cersei to torment.

222
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:25,867
They beat me, they humiliated me,
they married me to the Imp.

223
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,705
I had no friends in King's Landing...

224
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,166
except one.

225
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,049
He saved me.

226
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:45,053
Smuggled me away when he had the chance.

227
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:51,601
He knew I'd be safe here in the Eyrie
with my own blood, my aunt Lysa.

228
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:57,607
But the Lannisters have friends
everywhere. Even the Vale.

229
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,986
He made me swear
not to tell anyone my true name.

230
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,822
Your secret is safe with us, my lady.

231
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:06,366
Your father grew up right here
in these halls.

232
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:10,162
We hunted together many times.
He was a fine man.

233
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,291
Tell us what happened to your aunt, Sansa.

234
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:19,796
You knew her well, my lords, my lady.

235
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,466
You knew she was a troubled woman.

236
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:26,094
She always loved Lord Baelish.
She told me herself.

237
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,347
From the moment he arrived
at the gates of Riverrun,

238
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:30,682
a boy of eight,

239
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,851
carrying everything he owned
in a little sack.

240
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:37,564
She confessed to me,
she never loved Lord Arryn.

241
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:41,651
She did as her father commanded,
as so many of us have.

242
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:45,947
When the gods finally allowed her
to be with Lord Baelish,

243
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,282
she was so happy.

244
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:49,201
For a time.

245
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:53,246
My aunt was a jealous lady.

246
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:59,669
She was terrified
that Lord Baelish didn't love her anymore.

247
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,880
That he would abandon her
for a younger woman.

248
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:07,094
And then...

249
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,264
one day she saw him kiss me.

250
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:13,642
-Lady Sansa.
-It was a peck on the cheek,

251
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,018
Lord Royce, nothing more.

252
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:19,606
Lord Baelish is my uncle now,
in truth, by marriage.

253
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:25,153
He's always been so kind to me.
I was so happy to be here, to be free.

254
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:26,988
All because of him.

255
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:33,245
But my aunt turned on me.
She cursed me. Called me a whore.

256
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:35,622
Promised to throw me
through the Moon Door.

257
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:40,085
When Lord Baelish tried to calm her,
she struck him.

258
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,129
She said she didn't want to live anymore.

259
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:45,799
She stood on the edge of that Moon Door.
He tried to reason with her.

260
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:48,051
Promised her she was the only one
he had ever loved,

261
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:52,806
but she stepped through those doors
and she was...

262
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:01,022
It's not your fault, sweet girl.

263
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:08,780
It's not your fault.

264
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,840
You could see it
in the way she raised that boy.

265
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:29,801
Feeding him from her own teats
when he was ten years old.

266
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:34,306
-Lord Royce! This is hardly the time.
-Apologies, my lady.

267
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:38,268
And to you as well, Baelish.
We treated you a bit harshly.

268
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:41,479
You want justice, Lord Royce.
I can hardly complain about that.

269
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,231
I want the same.

270
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:48,153
Not much justice
to be meted out in suicide, is there?

271
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:50,030
For Lysa, no. But for her son?

272
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:52,824
And only 20 years ago,
the Knights of the Vale

273
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:56,036
rode behind Jon Arryn, Ned Stark,
Robert Baratheon.

274
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:59,206
They fought together
to overcome the Mad King.

275
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:03,168
And since then, Arryn and Royce,
Corbray, Waynwood,

276
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:06,338
all the great houses of the Vale
watched from the corner.

277
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:08,381
A timid boy at a tavern brawl.

278
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:10,842
Are you questioning our courage?

279
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:13,511
I want to know which side you're on.

280
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,388
I mean, do you support the Lannisters,

281
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:17,682
the house that executed
your friend Ned Stark?

282
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:20,018
Well, of course.
We don't support the damn Lannisters.

283
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:23,563
No? Catelyn Stark begged her sister
for support and Lysa refused.

284
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:26,733
By staying out of the fray,
you've allowed Tywin Lannister

285
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:29,236
to destroy his rivals
on every compass point.

286
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:30,779
Who stands against him now?

287
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,573
Who would you have us back,
Lord Baelish?

288
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,367
Robb Stark is dead.

289
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:39,371
I'd have you back Robin Arryn,
Lord of the Vale.

290
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:41,748
Robin Arryn is a sickly little boy.

291
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:44,876
And sickly little boys
sometimes become powerful men.

292
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,711
More often they die young.

293
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,506
I adored Lysa with all my heart.

294
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:53,635
But she loved her son so much,
she became overprotective.

295
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:57,722
He needs to learn how to swing a sword.
How to ride a horse.

296
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:00,850
-Aye, it's time.
-Yes, it's time.

297
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:04,521
Time for him to tour the Vale,
to visit all the castles in his domain.

298
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,899
Time for Robin to leave the nest.

299
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,212
Ser Barristan.

300
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,339
Yes?

301
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,718
Who sent you?

302
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:12,756
-Ser Barristan.
-Ser Jorah.

303
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:16,801
-Have I forgotten a council meeting?
-No.

304
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,229
What's this?

305
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:32,484
A royal pardon,
signed by Robert Baratheon.

306
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:48,041
You spied on her.

307
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,963
-Who gave you this?
-Does it matter?

308
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:07,185
-Have you told her?
-I wanted to tell you first, man-to-man.

309
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:09,896
Rather than go behind your back.

310
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:17,404
-Let me speak with her in private.
-You'll never be alone with her again.

311
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,484
Why did the usurper pardon you?

312
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,073
-If we could speak alone.
-No.

313
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,325
Speak to me here.

314
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,578
Explain it to me.

315
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:10,415
Who do you think sent this to Meereen?
Who profits?

316
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:14,627
This is the work of Tywin Lannister.
He wants to divide us.

317
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:17,380
If we're fighting each other,
we're not fighting him.

318
00:29:17,755 --> 00:29:20,091
The pardon was signed the year we met.

319
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:23,845
Why were you pardoned?

320
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,805
Unless you're saying
this document was forged.

321
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:31,686
-It is not forged.
-Why, then?

322
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:36,691
I sent letters to Varys,
the spymaster of King's Landing.

323
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:39,152
What was the content of these letters?

324
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:41,362
-Information.
-What information?

325
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,449
When you and Viserys arrived in Pentos.

326
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,495
His plan to marry you to Khal Drogo.
When you were married.

327
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:50,872
When your brother died.

328
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,625
You told him I was carrying Drogo's child?

329
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:55,502
-I--
-Yes or no?

330
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:56,753
-Khaleesi.
-Don't call me that.

331
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:59,339
Did you tell them
I was carrying Drogo's child?

332
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:04,260
Yes.

333
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:10,558
That wine merchant tried to poison me
because of your information.

334
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:13,978
-I stopped you from drinking his wine.
-Because you knew it was poisoned.

335
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,690
-I suspected.
-You betrayed me...

336
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:20,693
from the first.

337
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:22,320
Forgive me.

338
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:25,406
I never meant...

339
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:30,036
-Please, Khaleesi, forgive me.
-You sold my secrets

340
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,913
to the man who killed my father

341
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,831
-and stole my brother's throne...
-I have protected you.

342
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:36,125
-Fought for you. Killed for you.
-...and you want me to forgive you?

343
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:41,714
-I have loved you.
-Love?

344
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:45,635
Love? How can you say that to me?

345
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:48,638
Any other man,
and I would have you executed.

346
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:52,433
But you, I do not want you in my city,
dead or alive.

347
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:55,270
Go back to your masters
in King's Landing.

348
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,480
Collect your pardon if you can.

349
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:05,989
-Daenerys, please--
-Don't ever presume to touch me again

350
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:07,115
or speak my name.

351
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:10,827
You have until dusk to collect your things
and leave this city.

352
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,454
If you're found in Meereen
past break of day,

353
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,873
I'll have your head thrown
into Slaver's Bay.

354
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,128
Go.

355
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:23,631
Now.

356
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:21,439
Moat Cailin is yours, Father.

357
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:30,031
Walk with me.

358
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:33,951
-Has there been any word from Locke?
-No.

359
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:38,081
Unimportant. A cripple, the young boy.

360
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,917
None of the northern lords have seen them.

361
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:43,586
Dead most likely.

362
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:47,965
Most of the ironborn have fled the North.

363
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:52,637
Now more will follow, thanks to you.

364
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:56,849
Tell me what you see.

365
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:04,482
Moors, fields, hills.

366
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,276
Tell me what you see.

367
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:13,324
Nothing.

368
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:16,285
Not nothing. The North.

369
00:33:17,995 --> 00:33:20,540
Ride 700 miles that way,
you're still in the North.

370
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:23,126
Four hundred miles that way.

371
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:25,712
Three hundred miles that way.

372
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:29,215
The North is larger
than the other six kingdoms combined.

373
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,092
And I am the Warden of the North.

374
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:33,553
The North is mine.

375
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:37,890
Now tell me, what is your name?

376
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:43,688
Ramsay Snow.

377
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:45,982
No, not Ramsay Snow.

378
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:48,985
Open it.

379
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:53,740
From this day until your last day,
you are Ramsay Bolton,

380
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:56,784
son of Roose Bolton, Warden of the North.

381
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,084
You honor me.

382
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:09,672
I swear I will uphold your name
and your tradition.

383
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:15,261
I will be worthy of you, Father,
I promise.

384
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:37,200
Come, Reek, I'll be needing a bath.

385
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:07,438
Yes?

386
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,871
First time I saw you,
you were just a child.

387
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:26,791
A girl from the North
come to the capital for the first time.

388
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,252
You're not a child any longer.

389
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:34,966
Why did you help me?

390
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,010
They would have thrown you
through the Moon Door

391
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:39,095
if they found you guilty.

392
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:41,848
That's not an answer.

393
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:48,187
If they'd have executed you,
what would they have done with me?

394
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:50,815
I don't know.

395
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,150
Neither do I.

396
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:59,031
Better to gamble on the man you know
than the strangers you don't?

397
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:02,702
And you think you know me?

398
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,665
-I know what you want.
-Do you?

399
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:27,685
I thought it'd make me happy,
but it doesn't. Not really.

400
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:29,645
Nothing makes you happy.

401
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:31,814
-Lots of things make me happy.
-Like what?

402
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:34,358
-Killing Polliver, killing Rorge.
-So you're sad

403
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:38,237
because you didn't get to kill
Joffrey yourself. Is that it?

404
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:39,739
At least I could have been there to watch.

405
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:42,825
I wanted to see the look in his eyes
when he knew it was over.

406
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:45,661
Aye, nothing in the world beats that look.

407
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:49,790
You protected him for most of his life.
You think you could have saved him?

408
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,919
I wasn't the damn wine taster.

409
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:59,300
Little shit deserved to die, but poison...

410
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:01,969
poison's a woman's weapon.

411
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,096
Men kill with steel.

412
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:07,642
That's your stupid pride talking.
It's why you'll never be a great killer.

413
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,937
I'd have killed Joffrey
with a chicken bone if I had to.

414
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:15,274
I'd pay good money to see that.

415
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,237
You should have let me burn it.

416
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:22,782
It's a fleabite.

417
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:27,161
That fleabite's got you walking
a lot slower than you used to.

418
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:30,581
Well, we won't have to walk
too much further.

419
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:33,960
-You really think my aunt will pay for me?
-Aye, she'll pay.

420
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:35,419
I've never even met her.

421
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,798
Doesn't matter. You're her blood.

422
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:43,594
Family, honor, all that horseshit.

423
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,013
It's all you lords and ladies
ever talk about.

424
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:48,057
I'm not a lady.

425
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,394
Who would pass the Bloody Gate?

426
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:55,106
The bloody Hound, Sandor Clegane.

427
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:56,565
And his...

428
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:03,364
traveling companion, Arya Stark.
Niece of your Lady Lysa Arryn.

429
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:05,908
Then I offer my condolences.

430
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,577
Lady Arryn died.

431
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:13,416
Three days ago.

432
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:34,353
I've never left home before, Uncle Petyr.

433
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:36,355
-I'm afraid to leave.
-You shouldn't be.

434
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:39,483
The Lord of the Vale
belongs in the Eyrie, Mother said.

435
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:43,779
-She said it's not safe outside.
-It wasn't safe for her inside.

436
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:48,993
People die at their dinner tables.
They die in their beds.

437
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:52,121
They die squatting
over their chamber pots.

438
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:57,084
Everybody dies sooner or later.
And don't worry about your death.

439
00:38:58,627 --> 00:38:59,920
Worry about your life.

440
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:04,258
Take charge of your life
for as long as it lasts.

441
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:07,720
That is what it means
to be Lord of the Vale.

442
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:33,454
Shall we go?

443
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,589
Wine always helps.

444
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:46,884
I thank you for it.

445
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:51,055
Trial by combat.

446
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:57,269
Deciding a man's guilt or innocence
in the eyes of the gods,

447
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:00,564
by having two other men
hack each other to pieces.

448
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,109
Tells you something about the gods.

449
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:07,113
How much longer?

450
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:09,990
Soon.

451
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:14,912
Do you think Oberyn has a chance?

452
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:21,252
The Red Viper of Dorne.
You don't get a name like that

453
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:23,671
-unless you're deadly, right?
-I've never seen him fight.

454
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:26,549
Oh, he's going to die. I'm going to die.

455
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:29,176
-Oberyn believes in himself.
-That's putting it mildly.

456
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:35,349
What's the punishment for regicide?
Drawing and quartering? Hanging?

457
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:38,227
-Breaking at the wheel?
-Beheading.

458
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:39,728
Seems rather ordinary.

459
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:42,273
And he was my nephew as well,
so what is that?

460
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:45,943
Fratricide is brothers. Filicide is sons.

461
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,405
Nepoticide. That's the one.

462
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:57,997
Matricide, patricide, infanticide,
suicide.

463
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:01,792
There's no kind of killing
that doesn't have its own word.

464
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:05,713
-Cousins.
-Cousins, you're right.

465
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:08,883
There is no word for cousin killing.
Well done.

466
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,553
Do you remember cousin Orson?
Orson Lannister?

467
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:15,097
Of course.
Wet-nurse dropped him on his head.

468
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:16,849
-Left him simple.
-Simple?

469
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:20,811
Used to sit all day in the garden.
Crushing beetles with a rock.

470
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:28,444
-Nothing made him happier.
-Nothing made you happier.

471
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,654
You'd think being tormented from birth

472
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,823
would have given you some affinity
for the afflicted.

473
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:35,993
On the contrary,
laughing at another person's misery

474
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:37,870
was the only thing that made me feel
like everyone else.

475
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:41,957
-The joke wore thin, though.
-For you. You drifted away.

476
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:45,419
-I had other interests.
-Yes, other interests.

477
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:50,174
-But I stayed with Orson.
-Why?

478
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,718
I was curious.

479
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:56,722
Why was he smashing all those beetles?
What did he get out of it?

480
00:41:57,556 --> 00:41:58,766
First thing I did was ask him.

481
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:02,603
"Orson, why are you smashing
all those beetles?"

482
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:05,940
He gave me an answer.
"Smash the beetles."

483
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:07,233
"Smash 'em."

484
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:13,656
I wasn't deterred.
I was the smartest person I knew.

485
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:15,866
Certainly I had the wherewithal
to unravel the mysteries

486
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,201
that lay at the heart of a moron.

487
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:23,374
-So, I went to Maester Volarik's library.
-Volarik. Tried to touch me once.

488
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:25,918
Turns out, far too much has been written
about great men,

489
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:27,920
and not nearly enough about morons.

490
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:29,838
Doesn't seem right.

491
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,925
In any case,
I found nothing that illuminated

492
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:34,635
the nature of Orson's affliction,

493
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:37,429
or the reason behind
his relentless beetle slaughter.

494
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:39,890
So, I went back to the source.

495
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,059
I may not have been able
to speak with Orson,

496
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:47,147
but I could observe him, watch him,
the way men watch animals

497
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,525
to come to a deeper understanding
of their behavior.

498
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:56,282
And as I watched,
I became more and more sure of it.

499
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:58,742
There was something happening there.

500
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:04,623
His face was like the page of a book
written in a language I didn't understand.

501
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:07,084
But he wasn't mindless.
He had his reasons.

502
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:10,587
And I became possessed
with knowing what they were.

503
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:13,841
I began to spend
inordinate amounts of time watching him.

504
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:19,138
I would eat my lunch in the garden,
chewing my mutton to the music of...

505
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:23,809
And when I wasn't watching him,
I was thinking about him.

506
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:28,022
Father droned on about the family legacy,
and I thought about Orson's beetles.

507
00:43:28,605 --> 00:43:31,317
I read the histories
of Targaryen conquests.

508
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,944
Did I hear dragon wings? No. I heard...

509
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:39,992
And I still couldn't figure out
why he was doing it.

510
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:42,661
And I had to know,
because it was horrible

511
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:45,831
that all these beetles should be dying
for no reason.

512
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:50,085
Every day around the world,
men, women, and children are murdered

513
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:53,881
by the score. Who gives a dusty fuck
about a bunch of beetles?

514
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:56,300
I know, I know.
But still, it filled me with dread.

515
00:43:57,551 --> 00:44:00,095
Piles and piles of them,
years and years of them.

516
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:02,056
How many countless living crawling things

517
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:04,475
smashed and dried out,
and returned to the dirt?

518
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:10,022
In my dreams, I found myself standing
on a beach made of beetle husks

519
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:11,732
stretching as far as the eye could see.

520
00:44:12,649 --> 00:44:16,362
I woke up crying,
weeping for their shattered little bodies.

521
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:18,781
I tried to stop Orson once.

522
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:21,617
-He was twice your size.
-He just pushed me aside with a...

523
00:44:22,659 --> 00:44:23,827
and kept on smashing.

524
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:28,791
Every day, until that mule kicked him
in the chest and killed him.

525
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:41,387
So what do you think?

526
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:44,640
Why did he do it?

527
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:47,101
What was it all about?

528
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,398
I don't know.

529
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:13,001
Good luck today.

530
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,454
Looks like very light armor.

531
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:51,248
-I like to move around.
-You could at least wear a helmet.

532
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:55,002
You shouldn't drink before a fight.

533
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:57,212
You learn this during your years
in the fighting pits?

534
00:45:58,172 --> 00:45:59,840
I always drink before a fight.

535
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:02,259
It could get you killed.
It could get me killed.

536
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:05,053
Today is not the day I die.

537
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:16,523
-You're going to fight that?
-I'm going to kill that.

538
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:23,071
He is the biggest man I've ever seen.

539
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:25,782
Size does not matter
when you are flat on your back.

540
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:26,909
Thank the gods.

541
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:34,833
In the sight of gods and men,
we gather to ascertain

542
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:41,673
the guilt or innocence of this... man,
Tyrion Lannister.

543
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:44,885
May the Mother grant them mercy.

544
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:48,347
May the Father give them
such justice as they deserve.

545
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:53,060
And may the Warrior guide the hand
of our champion--

546
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,071
Don't leave me alone in this world.

547
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:05,697
Never.

548
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:29,930
-Have they told you who I am?
-Some dead man.

549
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:37,855
I am the brother of Elia Martell.

550
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:39,856
And do you know
why I have come all the way

551
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:42,359
to this stinking shit-pile of a city?

552
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,361
For you.

553
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:52,452
I'm going to hear you confess
before you die.

554
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:57,416
You raped my sister. You murdered her.
You killed her children.

555
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,586
Say it now and we can make this quick.

556
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:11,346
Say it. You raped her.

557
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,266
You murdered her.

558
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:19,438
You killed her children.

559
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:35,162
You raped her! You murdered her!
You killed her children!

560
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:18,205
You raped her! You murdered her!

561
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:30,384
You killed her children!

562
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:44,189
Wait. Are you dying? No, no, no.
You can't die yet. You haven't confessed.

563
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:48,402
Say it.

564
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:52,489
Say her name. Elia Martell.

565
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:57,744
You raped her. You killed her children.
Elia Martell.

566
00:49:58,203 --> 00:49:59,788
Who gave you the order?

567
00:50:00,288 --> 00:50:02,290
Who gave you the order?

568
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:06,920
Say her name!
You raped her! You murdered her!

569
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:08,964
You killed her children!

570
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:11,591
Say it. Say her name.

571
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:14,428
Say it!

572
00:50:22,644 --> 00:50:24,187
Elia Martell.

573
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:28,817
I killed her children. Then I raped her.

574
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:33,155
Then I smashed her head in like this!

575
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:48,962
The gods have made their will known.

576
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:51,590
Tyrion Lannister,

577
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:56,136
in the name of King Tommen
of the House Baratheon, First of His Name.

578
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:59,181
You are hereby sentenced to death.
