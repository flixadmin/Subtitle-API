1
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,116
And when does Don Eladio arrive?

2
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,200
Let's see how the cook goes first.

3
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,272
Who's the chemist?

4
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,079
Is this a joke?

5
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,993
Okay, we've all met.

6
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,353
Let's get to work.

7
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,029
Please show him the phenylacetic acid.

8
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,311
We synthesize it ourselves.

9
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,517
All the ingredients are here.

10
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,555
What's the problem?

11
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,990
Mr. Pinkman was under the impression
that the phenylacetic acid...

12
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,556
...would already be synthesized
upon his arrival.

13
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,839
Any sophomore chemistry
student can make it.

14
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,033
What kind of amateur
have you brought us?

15
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,515
This is ridiculous.

16
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,393
I'm not letting some infant...

17
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,315
...who can't even synthesize
phenylacetic acid...

18
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,995
...teach me my business.

19
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,639
Clean up!

20
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,956
I'm so happy...

21
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,277
...you finally came to your senses.

22
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,716
May I present the cook.

23
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,072
Hello, young man.

24
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:54,594
He doesn't speak
a word of Spanish, does he?

25
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,552
And he's no chemist...

26
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,153
...I'll tell you that.

27
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:03,388
I don't care if he's a pig farmer.

28
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:07,235
He cooks better meth than you do...

29
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,274
...with all your fancy
college degrees.

30
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,798
And this one will have
plenty of time to learn Spanish.

31
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,754
What's in there?

32
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,598
A gift?

33
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:36,559
Gustavo, you're so generous.

34
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,791
It's a token of respect.

35
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,275
In honour of our renewed friendship.

36
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,352
Let's see what's in here.

37
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,870
No, impossible!

38
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,919
Zafiro Añejo!

39
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,715
Look at this.

40
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,276
Even the bottle is a work of art.

41
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,192
It's perfection!

42
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,352
Perhaps...

43
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,120
...it's too good to share.

44
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,117
What do you think, Gustavo?

45
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:25,512
It's yours to do with as you choose.

46
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,595
I choose...

47
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,512
...to drink it!

48
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,912
Careful.

49
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,076
That's beautiful stuff.

50
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,838
If you spill a drop...

51
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,110
...I'll cut off your hand.

52
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,231
Come on, hurry up.

53
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,595
This one's an addict.

54
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,075
To work, he must be sober.

55
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,510
None for you!

56
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,192
Enough business!

57
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,516
Bring the girls!

58
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,833
Cheer up, man.

59
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,556
...I'm not angry.

60
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,519
I had to spank you.

61
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,553
But what choice did I have?

62
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,588
Look, once every 20 years...

63
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,995
...you forget your place.

64
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:22,430
There's no place for emotion in this.

65
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:26,389
You of all people should understand.

66
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,155
Business is business.

67
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,672
If you'll excuse me.

68
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,196
- Where are you going?
- To use your bathroom.

69
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,271
If I may.

70
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,670
Show Gustavo the pisser.

71
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,636
And make sure he doesn't get lost.

72
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,678
Hurry up.

73
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,477
Don Eladio is dead!

74
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,794
His capos are dead!

75
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,319
You have no one left to fight for!

76
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,076
Fill your pockets...

77
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,998
...and leave in peace!

78
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,590
Or fight me...

79
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,273
...and die!
