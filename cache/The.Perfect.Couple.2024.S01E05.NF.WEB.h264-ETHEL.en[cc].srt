163
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,708
But they won't. Because I'm a white woman.

164
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:38,416
So gross.

165
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,000
Yeah, I... I guess.

166
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:45,291
I thought you might want
some of this stuff.

167

Byredo Blanche. The literal best.

169
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,750
Oh, I'm sorry.

170
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:04,375
It's okay.

171
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,791
-I can tell that you really loved her.
-[chuckles softly]

172
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:15,500
Sorry. It's just my friends are all like,

173
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,916
"What mommy-and-me music class
are you doing?"

174
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,666
And "Who's still wearing Golden Goose?"

175
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:24,250
I liked how you guys were just, like,

176
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:26,458
real.

177
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:28,625
Thank you.

178
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,041
I was looking forward
to being sisters-in-law, you know?

179
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:36,250
-Maybe having an ally here.
-[scoffs]

180
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:38,666
So everyone knows?

181
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,416
Oh, I thought you'd be leaving today.

182
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:42,125
Yeah, me too.

183
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:46,916
But Greer wants me to go
to this book party thing.

184
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,166
What? Why?

185
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,000
I guess so no one will ask
why I'm not there.

186
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:54,291
Oh.

187
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:57,791
Okay. Makes sense, I guess.

188
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:02,916
No, you know what?

189
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,750
You should go. Wear something amazing.

190
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:09,791
Hold your head up high.
Show them they can't break you.

191
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:12,750
I'll be your wingwoman.

192
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:16,875
-Really?
-Yeah.

193
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,958
-Since I read <i>Nightfalls on Nantucket...</i>
-[Greer] Yes.

194
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:50,041
...I just love looking forward
to your next book.

195
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,416
And I love knowing
what to get her for Christmas.

196
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,916
-Yeah. So true.
-[Greer] Oh, I love you both.

197

[all laughing]

00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:58,625
-Greer, I am so sorry I'm late.
-Give me one second.

199
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:00,541
Oh, Enid.

200
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:04,166
-Where's your other half?
-Great turn out. He's not gonna make it.

201
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,708
-Everything all right?
-Yes, yes.

202
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:08,458
Greer, you remember Hyacinth?

203
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:09,791
-Hi, babe.
-And this is Brad.

204
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:12,875
It's such a big day.
Here's one for the socials.

205
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,708
-We'll do one for us as well.
-For Brad.

206
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:17,500
-I love it. That's so good.
-Yeah. Got that? Thank you.

207
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:20,583
So I'm going to announce
the new direction today.

208
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,708
I thought this could be Dash and Dolly's
going-away party.

209
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:25,500
Did you tell them? Last novel.

210
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:26,583
[Enid] Mmm-hmm.

211
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:28,666
-Isn't that better?
-It's so much better.

212
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,041
[Greer] Oh, my God. What's this?

213
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:35,166
I did text him to ask for a video message,
but I haven't heard back.

214
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,000
So I solved the problem.

215
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,708
-What do you think?
-No!

216
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:42,416
-Absolutely not. Why would you want...
-No. Terrible.

217
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,625
-Really?
-Cover it. Roger, honestly, I told you.

218
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:49,375
You just say he is out of commission
for the day. Keep it simple.

219
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:50,333
[Roger] Okay.

220
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:52,541

Hey.

223
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,333
Oh, hey!

224
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,458
I didn't know you were gonna...
You were going to be here.

225
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:03,541
Yeah.

226
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,541
Um...

227
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:09,208
Do you want to maybe hang out after this?
Want to have fun?

228
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:12,041
Um, I... I don't think I can, actually.

229
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,000
Because of the boat.

230
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:17,166
-I... I would. I'm just grounded.
-Totally. I get it. I'm sorry.

231
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:19,625
Okay.

232
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,000
Don't worry. It'll be fine.

233
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,375
We'll take one of those. Thank you.

234
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,166
Thank you.

235
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:36,875
Jesus. It looks like Lilly Pulitzer
projectile-vomited all over this place.

236
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,083
Who is gonna tell
the middle-aged men of the world

237
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:45,750
that they cannot wear shorts with loafers?
Is it going to have to be me?

238
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:51,833
You know, I'll deny I ever said this,
but I don't totally blame you.

-rich.
-Interesting.

Oh!

245
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:06,791
Okay.

246
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:11,208
Well, at Deerfield, he had bodyguards.

247
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:13,666
He's, like, kidnap-rich.

248
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,250
He never mentioned that.

249
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,000
Yeah, he plays it down.

250
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,708
People with that kind of money
don't talk about their money.

251
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:25,375
Plus, I've always gotten the sense
it was, like, Middle Eastern in some way.

252
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,291
No, he's from India.

253
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:28,375
Exactly.

254
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:30,708

[indistinct chatter continues]

256

Aren't you people supposed to be able
to tell when someone's shining you on?

257
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:48,250
I'm telling you the truth.

258
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,500
What... We've known each other now,
what, ten, 15 years?

When you came here with, uh...

260
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:56,416
Chloe.

261
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,375
Right, with Chloe in 2014...

262
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,083
After her mother passed.

263
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,541
-Right.
-Hmm.

264
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,041
After that, yeah.

I'm so sorry.

-Congratulations! This is so amazing!
-Thank you. Yes.

-Look at you.
-You must be so proud.

I am. I am.

269

-That's great. Thank you.
-Oh!

270
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:27,291
In France, we don't let this kind of thing
get us down, you know?

271
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:33,875
Maybe you could get some
hot apology sex out of it.

272
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:42,000
Maybe, but we're not in France, and,
um, this really isn't helping. Thank you.

273
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:45,750
I'm just saying,
don't let it derail your life.

274
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:49,000
An affair is just the heart's way
to check if it's still alive.

275
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,083
The heart...

276
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:52,416
Or the pussy.

277
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,625
Sometimes both.

278
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,666
This is interesting. Um...

279
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:03,291
That's good advice,
and I'll take it onboard. Thank you.

for very long before Miss Sacks found her,

290
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,916
but we know she stayed out late,

291
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,291
and we know you were
part of the late-night crew.

292
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:48,500
I never said I wasn't.

for you to dose somebody's drink.

So,

if there's anything you haven't told us,

296

let us do all the legwork

and eventually
we'll get to the truth anyway.

But even if you didn't do it,

304

for not helping us find out who did.

I honestly adore you.

No, I don't know. What do you mean?
What does that mean exactly?

355
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:45,416
Well, for one thing,
there are a couple of, uh...

356
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:49,625
pretty inconvenient truths
that I have to address,

357

Yeah, I guess I just

don't really consider it cheating
if it's more of an exit ramp.

00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:09,416
I need to get my mind off everything.
I've had a hell of a day.

792
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:12,791
[chuckles] Please?

793
00:45:12,875 --> 00:45:15,208
Okay, uh, I'll play. Um...

794
00:45:16,666 --> 00:45:18,250
Isabel Nallet.

795
00:45:18,333 --> 00:45:21,250
Ah! Oh, she's been in love with my husband
for years.

796
00:45:21,333 --> 00:45:24,625
She, um, finds out
that he's sleeping with Merritt

797
00:45:24,708 --> 00:45:27,125
and decides to eliminate the competition.

798
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:30,833
[chuckles] Well, okay. That's an easy one.

799
00:45:30,916 --> 00:45:32,708
-How about you?
-[laughs]

800
00:45:33,875 --> 00:45:35,916
[inhales deeply]

801
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,750
I would say what makes it so obvious
is what makes it so unlikely.

802
00:45:41,833 --> 00:45:45,916
Yeah, well. But maybe that's your cover,
you know, hiding in plain sight.

803
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,833
Mmm. Mmm!

804
00:45:48,916 --> 00:45:50,000
That'd be a good one.

805
00:45:50,083 --> 00:45:51,333
[Dan] Uh-huh.

806
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:54,166
Having a drink with me right now,
offering to help.

807
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:56,500
I mean, who would do that
if they were guilty?

808
00:45:56,583 --> 00:45:58,291
It would take a very good liar.

809
00:45:58,375 --> 00:46:01,458
-Well, you do write fiction.
-One Dark 'N' Stormy.

810
00:46:01,541 --> 00:46:08,250
I see. But even the best of liars
get very tired juggling too much.

811
00:46:08,875 --> 00:46:12,166
Or it gets too overwhelming,
and they... [clicks tongue] snap.

812
00:46:14,541 --> 00:46:16,875
Is there something
that you want to tell me?

813
00:46:22,666 --> 00:46:23,833
[glass thuds]

814
00:46:27,041 --> 00:46:28,041
That's good.

815
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:34,500
-[cell phone ringing]
-[Dan chuckles softly]

816
00:46:39,541 --> 00:46:41,791
-Excuse me.
-Of course.

817
00:46:45,791 --> 00:46:46,791
Carter.

818
00:46:47,375 --> 00:46:49,166
Hello? Chief, are you there?

819
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:52,958
-You're on speakerphone with me and Carl.
-Hey, Chief.

820
00:46:53,041 --> 00:46:54,583
<i>-Yeah.</i>
-Okay.

821
00:46:54,666 --> 00:46:55,791
Um...

822
00:46:55,875 --> 00:46:58,625
Get this. The night Merritt died,

823
00:46:58,708 --> 00:47:01,375
Greer was on the phone
with someone at the Sand Dollar

824
00:47:01,458 --> 00:47:04,250
about a half-hour
before our estimated time of death.

825
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:06,958
Who?

826
00:47:07,041 --> 00:47:10,250
Well, the guest is a guy
named Broderick Graham,

827
00:47:10,333 --> 00:47:12,833
and he flew in from London that day.

828
00:47:12,916 --> 00:47:15,250
-It gets better, Chief.
<i>-Okay.</i>

829
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:20,000
So, it turns out
that Graham is some low-level errand boy

830
00:47:20,083 --> 00:47:22,333
for a gang with ties to the Turkish mafia.

831
00:47:22,416 --> 00:47:26,083
Yeah, he got tattoos, and he looks
like some kind of British Scarface.

832
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:29,083
So this gang,

833
00:47:29,166 --> 00:47:32,833
they run heroin out of Mumbai,
they dabble in the arms trade,

834
00:47:32,916 --> 00:47:36,333
<i>and Graham's been calling the house
ever since the night Merritt died.</i>

835
00:47:36,416 --> 00:47:37,291
[Carl] <i>He won't stop.</i>

836
00:47:37,375 --> 00:47:39,833
<i>-He's called nine times since that night.</i>
-[Henry] <i>Nine times!</i>

837
00:47:41,791 --> 00:47:44,250
-Okay.
-[Henry] <i>But this is the best part.</i>

838
00:47:44,333 --> 00:47:49,041
We found a record
of a wire transfer for $300,000

839
00:47:49,125 --> 00:47:51,458
to Broderick Graham from...

840
00:47:52,416 --> 00:47:53,416
Drumroll, Carl.

841
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,041
[imitates drum roll]

842
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,250
...Shooter Dival.

843
00:48:02,708 --> 00:48:04,416
[Dan] Yeah. Yeah.

844
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:06,666
Mmm-hmm.

845
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
[sighs]

846
00:48:19,208 --> 00:48:20,208
Right.

847
00:48:50,541 --> 00:48:51,541
[Merritt sighing]

848
00:49:03,916 --> 00:49:05,583
-[grunts] Fuck!
-[glass breaking]

849
00:49:07,291 --> 00:49:09,458
[grunting softly]

850
00:49:12,458 --> 00:49:13,583
[glass clinking]

851
00:49:15,958 --> 00:49:17,375
[door opens]

852
00:49:17,458 --> 00:49:18,583
Oh!

853
00:49:19,416 --> 00:49:20,416
Hi.
