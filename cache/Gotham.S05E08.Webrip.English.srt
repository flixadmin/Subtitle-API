<i>Previously on </i>Gotham<i>:</i>

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,343
- Alfred. The manor.
- It's my fault.

3
00:00:10,644 --> 00:00:11,845
Mr. Cobblepot.

4
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,615
Guns!

5
00:00:14,615 --> 00:00:16,783
This never would have happened
if you stayed with me.

6
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:20,420
You're having a baby with Barbara.

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,522
- Don't think I'm fit to be a mother?
- What do you think?

8
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:24,892
You live in Gotham.

9
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:28,395
I believe the time has come
for a change of scenery.

10
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:30,364
You found a way out of Gotham?

11
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,232
It's a submarine.

12
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:35,736
Reunification with the mainland
hangs on by a thread.

13
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:38,505
Toxic chemicals rain down on to the city

14
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:41,275
and the government cuts us adrift
for good.

15
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,512
Gotham's golden rule, no heroes.

16
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:47,014
No heroes.

17
00:00:47,014 --> 00:00:48,515
Watch out for him.

18
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:50,417
He thinks he's a white knight.

19
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:51,852
He's a loose cannon.

20
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:14,041
You two here
to pick up your grandchildren?

21
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:15,309
Come on, Babs.

22
00:01:15,309 --> 00:01:17,444
You got the only full bar in Gotham.

23
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:19,746
And if you, two dinosaurs,
wanna keep coming here,

24
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,682
you better up your intel.

25
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:24,451
We got a lead
on some black market heating oil.

26
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:30,123
One drink, to share.

27
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,260
Then you go wheeze to death
somewhere else.

28
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:43,470
Would you look at that?

29
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:48,709
Dix, look at you,

30
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:51,878
up and walking around,
you old son of a gun.

31
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:54,214
I've been looking for you two for a while.

32
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:56,249
You found us.

33
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:58,218
You two ever think about the past?

34
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,621
What we did?

35
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,524
- What are you talking about, Dix?
- About her.

36
00:02:05,826 --> 00:02:07,627
About what we did to the girl.

37
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:13,934
Who is that?
It is like the living death in here.

38
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:15,135
Enough of this.

39
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:22,642
Hey, Gramps.

40
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:38,492
Can you please repeat your story
for Mr. Wayne, Madame?

41
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:41,461
We live in the shelter on West End.

42
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:44,531
There are so many of us crammed in there.

43
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:48,201
So much uncertainty. Fear.

44
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:51,638
And with the river poisoned,
it should have been awful,

45
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:55,642
but people came together, made it a home.

46
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,146
- What happened?
- A couple of weeks ago,

47
00:02:59,146 --> 00:03:02,649
we heard rumours about something
underneath the building.

48
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:06,520
Where it connects to the sewer.

49
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,422
Then people started going missing.

50
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,658
Hank, my husband...

51
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,362
wanted to look for them.

52
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:19,433
Said we were a family.

53
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:21,535
So the two of you went searching for them.

54
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,906
It was so dark.

55
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:27,707
I didn't see what attacked us.

56
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:31,912
I hit my head and when I woke up,
Hank was gone.

57
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:36,983
Please, Mr. Wayne.

58
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,253
We have a daughter.

59
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,423
We'll do everything we can.

60
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,599
Should we tell Gordon?

61
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,468
Why, he's stretched thin as it is.

62
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:57,404
Alfred, we don't know who or what
is down there.

63
00:03:57,404 --> 00:04:00,073
We know there's a man down there
in danger,

64
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,908
and we know this lady sent for us.

65
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:04,444
So go on, then,
what do you think we should do?

66
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,615
Let's go find him.

67
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:13,120
Under normal circumstances,

68
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,755
I wouldn't have called you
for a couple of stiffs.

69
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,457
What do you normally do
when a couple of your patrons

70
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:19,126
- get stabbed?
- Bury the bodies.

71
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:20,961
Find out who did it
and then bury those bodies.

72
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:23,063
See, that's not something
you should be telling a cop.

73
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:24,865
We're living in a different world, Harvey.

74
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:27,367
- So why did you call us?
- Take a look.

75
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:34,875
- Boggs and Lewis.
- You know them?

76
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:37,744
They were cops.
They were gone before you joined.

77
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,412
- What happened?
- They came around.

78
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:41,548
Peddling third-rate intel.

79
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:45,318
It was closing time, so I let them in
and then some other fossil knifed them.

80
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:47,220
- You saw him?
- Yeah, he must have snuck in.

81
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,623
Looked like a cop too. These two knew him.

82
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:52,659
Bartender said
they called him Micks, Hicks.

83
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:55,495
- Dix?
- Maybe.

84
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:57,597
No way.

85
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,133
Dix was Harvey's old partner.

86
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,302
Oh, there we go. Case closed.

87
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,437
So you're telling me this guy
rolled in here in a wheelchair,

88
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,273
stabbed these two, and rolled on out?

89
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:08,308
He wasn't in a wheelchair.

90
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,977
Then it couldn't be Dix.
He's been paralysed for the last 15 years.

91
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,947
Harvey, you're confusing me
with someone who cares.

92
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:15,649
I called you as a courtesy,
and now I'm wishing I just

93
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,951
dumped these two corpses in an alley.

94
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:22,289
Do we even know that Dix
is still in Gotham after the bridges blew?

95
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:24,958
I heard he moved into an apartment
about a year ago.

96
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:28,495
I meant to check up on him,
but it can't be him.

97
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,497
I hear what you're saying,
but we should still talk to him.

98
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:31,798
Maybe he knows something.

99
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:34,034
Fine.

100
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,177
How are you feeling?

101
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,112
I'm fine. Thanks for asking.

102
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:48,682
Look, I've been giving you space,

103
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,283
but we have to talk
about how this is gonna work.

104
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:51,818
I'm gonna be a part of this kid's life.

105
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:53,620
Oh, you seem pretty confident about that.

106
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,322
I am.

107
00:05:55,322 --> 00:05:56,556
Reunification is gonna happen.

108
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:58,959
You should think about what kind of person
you wanna be when it does.

109
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:03,330
It's a chance for you to start anew.

110
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,031
I like who I am.

111
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,701
You were due hours ago.

112
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:45,272
Yes, I was. But I had to get us lunch.

113
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:47,941
- And I met Dale.
- I see that.

114
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:49,809
Do you see this?

115
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:52,712
Our secret plan to get off this island?

116
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:56,549
Relax. Dale is completely trustworthy.

117
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:58,785
How do you know we can trust him
if you just met him?

118
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:01,888
Because he's mute and dumb as a post.

119
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:05,191
Look, I know you're paranoid
about people watching us...

120
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,394
Someone is watching us!

121
00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:10,030
Why do you think I installed
this alarm system?

122
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:13,400
And as safe as I feel

123
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,769
with your jingle bell contraption
in place,

124
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:18,038
I went out and procured us some muscle.

125
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:19,205
You're welcome.

126
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:22,275
At least you're doing something.

127
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:26,980
How's my SS Gertrud coming along?

128
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:30,417
Our submarine is coming along just fine,
thank you.

129
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:32,485
I've been working on the sonar,

130
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:36,589
which turns out as far more complex
than I anticipated.

131
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:39,292
Well, I am confident
you will figure it out.

132
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:43,763
Of course I will figure it out.

133
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:48,068
Because I figure everything out.

134
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:49,969
The navigation system.

135
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,138
The oxygen exchange.

136
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:56,242
I will figure everything out
because I'm the only one working!

137
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:59,979
- This was supposed to be a partnership.
- It is!

138
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:03,316
I already did my part by stealing
everything valuable in Gotham,

139
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,618
- all of which you get half.
- No!

140
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:06,953
Your goons stole it.

141
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,088
And then you killed them.

142
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,325
Are you expecting someone?

143
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,493
Who would I be expecting, Oswald?

144
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,862
I told you someone's watching us.

145
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:17,497
Dale, go do what I pay you for.

146
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,968
Protect us!

147
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:26,206
Wait.

148
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:28,842
Penn?

149
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:32,645
Hello, Mr. Cobblepot.

150
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:36,383
Are you really...?

151
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:42,055
- I don't believe it. You're alive.
- Indeed, sir. I am.

152
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:46,126
But you were shot. I was there.

153
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:49,896
This whole time I thought you were dead,
but you're alive.

154
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,634
But you're only coming to me now?

155
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:59,672
I'm so terribly sorry, Mr. Cobblepot.
I wanted to come see you, but...

156
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,877
he wouldn't let me.

157
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,012
He? He who?

158
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,516
Mr. Cobblepot.

159
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:15,822
This is...

160
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:21,194
Mr. Scarface.

161
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:31,604
Wonderful.

162
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:38,278
Look, I'm sure Dix is in the clear,
but we do have to ask.

163
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,283
That's not it.

164
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:45,351
It's just that I feel that

165
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:47,687
I should've been by him before,
I'm all he's got.

166
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:50,757
Well, look, Guido, right?

167
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,865
Dix!

168
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:01,734
- What the heck?
- Bullock?

169
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:03,937
- Is that you?
- Yeah.

170
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,206
- Don't shoot.
- Okay.

171
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,575
Come in.

172
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:13,313
Is that the way
you always answer the door?

173
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:16,649
Nowadays you can't be too careful.

174
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,585
Especially someone like me.

175
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:21,254
A kid comes in,
he'd cut my throat for a cup of soup.

176
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:24,591
Anyway, I wasn't expecting you.

177
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:28,161
Figured you forgot about me.

178
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:30,129
Look, look, when the bridges came down

179
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:33,766
- and I got busy and...
- Oh, sure, sure. You forgot me.

180
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:35,902
Everybody forgets.

181
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:36,903
I didn't forget.

182
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,472
Planning on taking a trip?

183
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:41,975
Maybe.

184
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,677
I like to keep a bag packed just in case.

185
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:46,312
Yeah, where were you last night?

186
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,449
Where was I? I was right here.

187
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:52,752
Anybody else here with you?
Anybody that can back up your story?

188
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:56,456
You're asking me if I was out there
killing Boggs and Lewis?

189
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:02,128
Does it look like I was out there
killing Boggs and Lewis?

190
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:03,930
So you heard about that?

191
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,798
I'm gonna tell you something.

192
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:09,502
If it meant that I can get out
of this son of a gun wheelchair,

193
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:13,773
I would confess right here and now
to Boggs, to Lewis,

194
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:15,842
to anybody you want me to confess to.

195
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:18,511
All right, fine.
But if you were detective,

196
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,612
what would you say if you were us?

197
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:21,714
We come in here,
you're packing a suitcase.

198
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:27,153
I would say that I did it, which I didn't,

199
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:30,523
or I'd be very worried that I'd be next.

200
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:34,827
What do you mean, "You being next?"
What's your connection to Boggs and Lewis?

201
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,631
Now, come on, what?

202
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,466
Nothing.

203
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:42,702
I just work with them. That's it.

204
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:47,173
We... we worked the case together.

205
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:50,910
- Four of you?
- Yeah.

206
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:56,382
Dix wasn't my partner then.
I was a rookie cop.

207
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,085
- Wet behind the ears.
- So what was the case?

208
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,321
A woman killed her husband,
as far as I can remember,

209
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:02,388
it was pretty open and shut.

210
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,859
But at least we can agree
that Dix didn't walk into The Sirens

211
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,561
and stabbed those two guys.

212
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,363
So who did?

213
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:13,199
Barbara said Boggs and Lewis
recognised the killer.

214
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:14,434
They called him Dix.

215
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:16,536
We come in here, he's packing a suitcase,

216
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:18,371
he shoots at us, this stinks, Harvey.

217
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,580
Hey.

218
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:37,590
You all right?

219
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:42,395
What the hell?

220
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:58,811
These basements run along Gotham sewers.

221
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:01,981
The river is right next to it.

222
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:04,584
You mean the river filled
with Jeremiah's toxins?

223
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:07,487
Who knows what kind of damage
these chemicals could do.

224
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:08,755
Yeah, you're right.

225
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,426
It's just that you talked to Renee.

226
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,841
Hold on.

227
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:43,589
Bite marks.

228
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:48,961
- Animal?
- I say human I've never seen.

229
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:51,531
Whatever it was...

230
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:55,101
it dragged him that way.

231
00:13:57,437 --> 00:13:59,372
Seems like human skin.

232
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,976
Here's the file you asked for,
Victoria Cartwright.

233
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:04,977
How did you...

234
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:07,447
I had Harper run every case
the four of you worked,

235
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:10,783
cross-referenced with any woman
that killed her husband.

236
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:13,386
Do I need to read it?
You're gonna tell me what's in it.

237
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:17,156
Victoria Cartwright was a banker.
She led a very boring life.

238
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:20,493
Until she snapped
and put two .38 calibre slugs

239
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:23,229
into her husband. End of story.

240
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:25,565
You guys rehearsed that?

241
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:32,371
It says there was no physical evidence.

242
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:36,142
She was convicted on the statement
of her 7-year-old daughter, Jane.

243
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:38,344
This was 20 years ago. Where's Jane now?

244
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:42,348
What's the point? The killer was a man,
a man that can imitate frigging faces.

245
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:45,017
What was the name of the guy that Strange
got to imitate you?

246
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:48,187
A Basil something.
That's who we should be looking for.

247
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:50,156
That was different and you know it.

248
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:51,557
Do you have an address for this Jane?

249
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,360
No. But the family's old home
is in the Green Zone.

250
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,662
- Just east of the clinic.
- Jim, it's a dead end.

251
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:58,431
Is there anything else you wanna tell me?

252
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,102
You know what, why don't you hang back?

253
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:06,239
Whoa, whoa, wait. Are you benching me?

254
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,674
Killer's still out there.
Keep an eye on your partner.

255
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,918
Penn, Arnold.

256
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,621
It's Arthur.

257
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:26,092
- You're holding a doll.
- It's not a doll.

258
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:28,528
It's a dummy.

259
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:33,266
Oh, this is great. I'm going back to work.
Excuse me.

260
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:36,102
You're saying he made you come here?

261
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:38,437
Mr. Scarface is very persuasive.

262
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:42,775
Persuasive?

263
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,578
He made me tell him about your...

264
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:47,613
treasure.

265
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:50,817
Penn...

266
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,554
I think you need a rest.

267
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:58,457
And perhaps a psychiatrist.

268
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:02,128
Then we can discuss you
resuming your former duties.

269
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,997
Obviously, I won't pay you
for the time you were gone--

270
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:06,999
Shut your pie-hole!

271
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,503
This the one you were telling me about?

272
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:13,606
- Punk who thinks he's in charge?
- Yes, sir.

273
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:15,508
That's Mr. Cobblepot.

274
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:18,644
Oswald, if you won't make him leave,
I will.

275
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:22,415
- Yeah.
- No one's going anywheres.

276
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:25,785
Penn, show these dewdroppers
we're serious.

277
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,955
Forgive me.

278
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:42,335
Now, let's talk turkey, turkeys.

279
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:50,042
- What a mess, huh?
- Yeah.

280
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:54,480
Boggs and Lewis were idiots.
Complete idiots.

281
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,683
They should have known when they see
a guy walking, then it ain't me.

282
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:02,188
You think the Cartwright girl
said something?

283
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,122
How would I know?

284
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,494
So how've you been
since the bridges came down?

285
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:12,565
You getting enough food? Medicine?

286
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:14,734
What if I said no?

287
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:15,902
I'd feel like crap.

288
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:18,504
Then no.

289
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:25,177
The Cartwright girl is dead.

290
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:29,815
A buddy of mine who was a screw-over
at Arkham.

291
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:33,519
He said she was an inmate there
and she died a couple of years ago, so...

292
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,221
this has nothing to do with her.

293
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:51,337
GCPD. We're coming in.

294
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:03,115
Check upstairs.

295
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,732
Looks like this place has been abandoned
since before the bridges came down.

296
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:20,766
Yeah.

297
00:18:58,337 --> 00:18:59,338
What the hell?

298
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,159
What the hell was that?

299
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,151
Someone's been living here.

300
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:21,654
What's that smell?

301
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:35,901
Everything all right?

302
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:39,572
All good. No one's here.

303
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:49,715
Hey.

304
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:05,397
Don't look at me. Don't look at me!

305
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:11,303
We found your handiwork.

306
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:17,543
Nothing to say?

307
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:22,047
You're gonna have to take that mask off.

308
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:27,286
The only way you're gonna keep
that mask on is if you talk.

309
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,554
Otherwise, I'm gonna reach out
at this table

310
00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:30,422
and I'm gonna rip it off your face.

311
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:37,963
- Who are you?
- Nobody.

312
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,598
You're not Jane Cartwright?

313
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,402
Because you were in her childhood home.

314
00:21:45,004 --> 00:21:47,072
You're about the right age.

315
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:48,407
Talk to me, Jane.

316
00:21:50,276 --> 00:21:52,444
I know after your mother was convicted,

317
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:53,913
you ended up a ward of the state.

318
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:57,616
In and out of institutions
until you ended up at Arkham.

319
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:00,286
Then you vanished.

320
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:02,755
Some say died.

321
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:07,026
- What happened to you?
- Me?

322
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,763
Nothing happened to me.

323
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:13,499
Okay.

324
00:22:16,302 --> 00:22:17,303
What happened to Jane?

325
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:20,839
Well...

326
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,947
Lots happened to Jane.

327
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:32,384
She was taken from Arkham.

328
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:38,057
Down, down, down.
The doctor did things to her.

329
00:22:38,057 --> 00:22:40,025
Experiments on her and others.

330
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:43,229
Are you talking about Hugo Strange?

331
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:45,664
You were taken to Indian Hill?

332
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:49,068
The professor was obsessed
with the power to change.

333
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:51,971
The way a chameleon would change its skin.

334
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:54,740
He wanted humans to have that power.

335
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,644
He made it so Jane could change her skin,

336
00:22:58,644 --> 00:23:01,080
her bones, her hair,
the colour of her eyes.

337
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:05,718
All it takes is a single touch
and her body becomes a mirror.

338
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:09,521
And when it's done,
she sheds her skin and starts anew.

339
00:23:12,358 --> 00:23:15,327
It remembers everyone it touched.

340
00:23:17,196 --> 00:23:20,532
It's touched you, Detective.

341
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,272
We can help you, Miss Cartwright.

342
00:23:26,272 --> 00:23:28,707
Jane Cartwright is dead.

343
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:31,744
She died in Arkham.

344
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:37,416
That's when Jane Doe was born.

345
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,021
So why kill all these cops?

346
00:23:44,857 --> 00:23:46,892
You wanna know why they died?

347
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:53,232
Ask your friend.

348
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:42,981
What is that?

349
00:24:53,025 --> 00:24:53,859
Heck.

350
00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:56,862
We should head out.

351
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:57,996
My battery is dying...

352
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,672
Please. He's coming. He's coming.

353
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:08,140
Who's coming? What happened?

354
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:11,009
He's going to kill me. I barely got away.

355
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:14,980
- Are you Hank?
- Yes.

356
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,448
Your wife sent us.

357
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:18,050
Is there anyone else left below down here?

358
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:18,984
They're all dead.

359
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:25,057
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

360
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:54,386
Hank! Hank! Hold on, Hank!

361
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:02,661
Hand over the heaters.

362
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:04,897
If you don't mind.

363
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:09,034
Mr. Penn, can't we just talk this through?

364
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:10,169
Get back!

365
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:12,004
I'm so sorry.

366
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:16,041
At least tell me what happened
after Haven.

367
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:19,011
Help me to understand this.

368
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:23,382
Go on.

369
00:26:23,382 --> 00:26:25,684
Sing your song.

370
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:29,755
After I was shot...

371
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:34,226
I woke up in the GCPD morgue.

372
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:36,195
I was alone. I...

373
00:26:36,195 --> 00:26:39,731
I patched my wounds
as best I could and crawled out.

374
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:43,268
I hid in a store.

375
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:46,238
An abandoned magic shop.

376
00:26:46,238 --> 00:26:50,375
That's where Mr. Scarface found me.

377
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:54,446
And he told me all about you.

378
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:57,716
How you used him.

379
00:26:57,716 --> 00:27:00,385
Chewed him up and spat him out!

380
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,388
Treated him like a palooka!

381
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:06,225
- That's a lie!
- Oh, please, Oswald.

382
00:27:06,225 --> 00:27:08,093
It's what you do.

383
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:08,927
Arnold...

384
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:12,231
Arthur, what do you want?

385
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:13,966
I don't want anything.

386
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:17,769
But Mr. Scarface, well...

387
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:20,472
He wants your treasure.

388
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,842
And to be boss.

389
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:32,851
Really? The dummy wants
to be the boss of Gotham?

390
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:34,453
Bingo!

391
00:27:34,453 --> 00:27:36,288
Now give me the key to your treasure room.

392
00:27:36,288 --> 00:27:37,322
Why would I do that?

393
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:40,158
You're obviously gonna kill me anyway.

394
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,994
What am I doing?

395
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:45,197
- I'm talking to a doll!
- Dummy.

396
00:27:45,197 --> 00:27:47,299
- Seriously?
- You know what, Oswald?

397
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:49,001
Honestly, you deserve this.

398
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:52,037
- Nobody asked you.
- You are opportunistic!

399
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:55,140
Your loyalty is shaky at best!

400
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:58,143
And you will hurt anyone,
anyone to get what you want.

401
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:03,882
I hardly think you're one to throw stones.

402
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:05,284
Listen, Penn...

403
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:07,119
Eyes down here, pal.

404
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:11,990
Sorry. Mr. Scarface,
I got a question for you.

405
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,158
Shoot.

406
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:16,495
After you get your...

407
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:21,500
tiny wooden hands on that treasure,
what are you gonna do?

408
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,401
Where are you gonna go?

409
00:28:22,401 --> 00:28:24,069
People are gonna come after you
eventually.

410
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:26,572
Then I'll...

411
00:28:26,572 --> 00:28:30,809
I'll take them all on!
Yeah. Show them who's boss.

412
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:34,546
You wouldn't have to do that

413
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:37,049
if you could get off this island now,
would you?

414
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:38,684
What are you doing?

415
00:28:38,684 --> 00:28:41,820
Shut it! Let the smart one talk.

416
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:48,393
How do you feel about submarines?

417
00:28:53,432 --> 00:28:54,566
What are we doing here?

418
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:59,104
I just wanted to take us someplace quiet

419
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:00,372
where we could talk.

420
00:29:03,008 --> 00:29:06,845
- You did a bad thing.
- Oh, come on. Not that again.

421
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:08,914
We put a killer in jail, all right?

422
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:12,250
What do you keep moping about?
She was guilty.

423
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,419
She got what she deserved. Drop it.

424
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,222
Did you get what you deserved?

425
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:18,190
What?

426
00:29:19,725 --> 00:29:22,294
You made that girl into a murderer.

427
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:23,629
Oh, come on.

428
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:27,566
You, your friends...

429
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:30,802
- the kid.
- Come on, you...

430
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:33,305
I'm gonna make sure
you never do that again.

431
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:41,413
Harper, where is Dix?

432
00:29:41,413 --> 00:29:43,148
I saw Bullock take him in the back.

433
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,284
Barbara, what are you doing here?

434
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:49,321
Seems my bartender overheard
the killer say something

435
00:29:49,321 --> 00:29:51,456
before he ice picked Harvey's pals.

436
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,258
I thought I be a good citizen.

437
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:54,893
Okay.

438
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:56,995
"The kid's guilty too."

439
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:58,230
The kid.

440
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:04,670
Listen, what you said before
about me being a known criminal,

441
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:07,239
I was on some list your army buddy had.

442
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:09,574
When the government rolls in,
am I gonna be arrested?

443
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:11,677
Honestly, I don't know.

444
00:30:11,677 --> 00:30:13,478
But that would work out for you, right?

445
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:16,148
I go to jail, you get the baby.

446
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:17,182
I don't want that.

447
00:30:18,517 --> 00:30:21,787
Is that a promise?
I go straight, I'm clear?

448
00:30:21,787 --> 00:30:23,088
Stay right here.

449
00:30:23,088 --> 00:30:26,425
Hey, Harvey. Where did you take Dix?

450
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:27,959
I didn't take Dix anywhere.

451
00:30:32,531 --> 00:30:33,532
Oh, God.

452
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:39,304
She got into your locker,
must have taken your clothes.

453
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:41,273
We have to lockdown the GCPD.

454
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:44,342
Hey, Harvey...

455
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,211
We'll find her.

456
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,146
Come on.

457
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:56,388
Hey, look at the size of it.

458
00:30:58,724 --> 00:31:01,526
Living down here, the toxins of the river
must have driven him mad!

459
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:02,627
Get out of here now!

460
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:32,491
Alfred!

461
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:38,430
I'm, sorry!

462
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:42,901
- Alfred! Alfred! Stop!
- Stop!

463
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:43,735
Stop!

464
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:55,447
All right, everybody, listen up!

465
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:59,518
GCPD is now in lockdown.

466
00:31:59,518 --> 00:32:02,120
Nobody goes in or out unless I say so.

467
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,890
She can look like anybody by now,
how are we supposed to find her?

468
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:07,559
Jim!

469
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:11,229
Barbara? What happened?

470
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:13,131
What do you mean what happened?
I've been attacked.

471
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:15,400
- Where did she go?
- Wait a minute.

472
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:18,904
How do we know it's really you?

473
00:32:18,904 --> 00:32:19,938
Seriously?

474
00:32:21,573 --> 00:32:23,375
This isn't proof enough?

475
00:32:24,543 --> 00:32:26,578
- What the hell?
- That's her!

476
00:32:26,578 --> 00:32:28,280
She's the impostor! Shoot her!

477
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,119
It's me, you idiot!

478
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:35,287
That sounds like Barbara.

479
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:38,657
Barbara...

480
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:41,226
tell me where we first met.

481
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:48,266
Don't shoot.

482
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:49,634
I'm leaving here.

483
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:52,103
Anyone tries to follow me, she dies.

484
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,975
- Shoot her!
- We can't risk it.

485
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:57,909
Stay back!

486
00:33:01,847 --> 00:33:02,781
Bullock, wait!

487
00:33:04,783 --> 00:33:05,817
I'm fine.

488
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,853
All right, take her to my office,
don't let her out of your sight.

489
00:33:07,853 --> 00:33:08,920
Okay.

490
00:33:23,635 --> 00:33:26,838
I cannot believe
that you told them about the sub

491
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,341
and that you're playing along
with this psychosis.

492
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,509
Obviously, he was gonna kill you.

493
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:32,878
I bought us time.

494
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:38,783
I have an idea.

495
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:41,019
If you can just keep him busy
and wait for the signal.

496
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,153
Wait, what's the signal?

497
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:43,788
Quit your jawing!

498
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:51,162
So Mr. Scarface and I
have discussed our options.

499
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:56,368
And the submarine sounds like a good plan.

500
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:59,971
And since we'll need the smart one
to build this hayburner,

501
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:02,007
he can keep sucking air.

502
00:34:02,007 --> 00:34:04,242
But Penguin ain't so lucky.

503
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:09,748
Do it, Penn. Ventilate that mook.

504
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:15,020
I'm so sorry, Mr. Cobblepot.

505
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,923
I wish things would have
turned out differently.

506
00:34:17,923 --> 00:34:21,092
Arthur, I want you to listen
to what I'm saying.

507
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:23,662
You accused me of manipulating you,
but what about him?

508
00:34:23,662 --> 00:34:26,064
I never asked you to kill anybody.

509
00:34:26,932 --> 00:34:29,501
- That is true.
- Hey.

510
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:33,438
And think of everything
that we went through together.

511
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:37,509
Sofia Falcone, getting cut off
from the mainland, starving.

512
00:34:37,509 --> 00:34:40,578
You mean Penn was starving!

513
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:44,349
Fighting for scraps
while your dog ate steak!

514
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:46,751
I welcomed you into my home.

515
00:34:48,286 --> 00:34:52,424
And, yes, I was not a good friend,

516
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:53,892
to you or to anyone.

517
00:34:56,962 --> 00:34:58,697
It's why I'm alone.

518
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:04,703
But I saw you for what you are
and I value that.

519
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,573
That must be worth something.

520
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:13,611
Applesauce!

521
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:16,081
You're a liar and a thief.

522
00:35:16,081 --> 00:35:18,750
All you do is take.

523
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,719
Take. Take.

524
00:35:21,753 --> 00:35:23,588
And you never give anything.

525
00:35:24,923 --> 00:35:27,158
You worked me to the bone.

526
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:29,227
Forced me to be your puppet.

527
00:35:31,396 --> 00:35:32,397
Well, no more.

528
00:35:36,568 --> 00:35:37,435
You hear me?

529
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:41,673
No more.

530
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,746
Take that! And that!

531
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,022
No.

532
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:02,527
Mr. Cobblepot.

533
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:05,930
You freed me.

534
00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:09,801
How can I ever thank you?

535
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:18,009
Why did you do that?

536
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:19,944
He wasn't the threat.

537
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:21,513
- The dummy was the threat...
- Oswald.

538
00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:25,650
I accept you for the person that you are.

539
00:36:27,152 --> 00:36:29,487
Just as you accept me
for the cold logician that I am.

540
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:34,125
That's why this friendship is great.

541
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:35,827
And as friends,

542
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:39,064
I think we can both agree that
that lunatic had to be stopped.

543
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:47,739
Perhaps, Edward...

544
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:50,875
we really are meant for each other.

545
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:12,730
Jane!

546
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:19,404
I know you're up here!

547
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:37,422
Jane, I knew you'd be here.

548
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:40,425
I'm sorry.

549
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:45,396
It was my job to protect you
and I let you down.

550
00:37:47,132 --> 00:37:49,234
You made Jane into a killer.

551
00:37:50,702 --> 00:37:54,239
You and your friends,
there have to be consequences.

552
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:56,641
You killed three men already.
When is it enough?

553
00:37:58,743 --> 00:37:59,911
When you're dead.

554
00:38:01,246 --> 00:38:02,914
Put the gun down!

555
00:38:02,914 --> 00:38:04,382
Shoot me.

556
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,486
You killed Jane years ago,

557
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:11,256
and you didn't even know how to shoot me?

558
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:21,399
Let me see your face.

559
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:24,936
Your real face.

560
00:38:26,104 --> 00:38:29,007
Why? So you can see what a monster she is?

561
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,612
Hugo Strange only destroyed her face.

562
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:36,614
You destroyed her soul.

563
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:41,920
Let me see it.

564
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,145
Do you see?

565
00:39:08,947 --> 00:39:10,682
Do you see what they did?

566
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,555
Jane...

567
00:39:20,225 --> 00:39:23,127
we can work this out
just put the gun down.

568
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:26,231
The only way this ends
is with one of us dead.

569
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:46,251
Oh, hey, you're alive.

570
00:39:46,251 --> 00:39:49,153
The nurse thinks the man that attacked us
will never recover.

571
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:52,890
The toxins in the river have done
irreparable damage to his brain.

572
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,158
Well, I just think it's a shame
we couldn't save

573
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:56,160
the rest of the people
who went missing, Master Bruce.

574
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:59,931
We should have went to Gordon
from the start.

575
00:39:59,931 --> 00:40:01,766
- We were reckless.
- Ah, it's nonsense.

576
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:04,702
We took decisive action,
we saved a man's life.

577
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:06,170
The people in this city have suffered,
Master Bruce.

578
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,706
They need someone to protect them.

579
00:40:10,942 --> 00:40:12,010
I agree.

580
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,180
But there are better ways
to find absolution.

581
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:21,252
I don't follow.

582
00:40:22,387 --> 00:40:24,222
What happened to Wayne Manor
wasn't your fault.

583
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,225
I know you've been blaming yourself.

584
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,895
You didn't destroy our home, Alfred.

585
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:32,130
I feel like I did.

586
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:36,367
I feel like I wasn't strong enough
to fight Tetch

587
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:38,069
and that low life, Valeska.

588
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:43,875
I feel like because of my weakness,
you lost your last tie to the past.

589
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:48,479
You lost your home, Master Bruce.

590
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,951
I must never be that weak again.

591
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,791
Part of being a family

592
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:01,926
is that we can be strong for each other.

593
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:10,168
When did you get so smart?

594
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:12,637
I had a good teacher.

595
00:41:17,275 --> 00:41:19,410
Victoria Cartwright killed her husband.

596
00:41:20,745 --> 00:41:24,015
After we arrested her, she admitted it.

597
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:25,450
Later she recanted.

598
00:41:26,918 --> 00:41:30,421
But the physical evidence wasn't there.
I was a new cop.

599
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:33,091
- I wanted to make detective...
- So you leaned on Jane?

600
00:41:34,292 --> 00:41:36,928
Coerced a statement out of her
to put her mother away.

601
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:40,098
The woman was guilty.

602
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,634
Later I found out the husband...

603
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:46,671
beat the mother and Jane.

604
00:41:47,772 --> 00:41:49,374
I didn't know until after.

605
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:56,447
The bartender overheard Jane
say something about,

606
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:57,782
"The kid's guilty too."

607
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:01,185
She meant the young cop.

608
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,788
She meant you.

609
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:07,959
I knew something was wrong.

610
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,162
I felt it.

611
00:42:13,398 --> 00:42:15,833
I said something and they told me
to keep my trap shut,

612
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:17,969
just close the case, put a bow on it.

613
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:23,808
After a while I stopped feeling it.

614
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:28,646
And I went down that path for a long time.

615
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:29,847
Until I met you.

616
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:36,854
However much have changed...

617
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:40,191
I can't change the past.

618
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:43,828
I made that girl a killer.

619
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:48,332
What do you want from me, Harvey?

620
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:51,702
Forgiveness?

621
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:56,007
I can't give that to you.

622
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:00,745
I just needed you to know.
