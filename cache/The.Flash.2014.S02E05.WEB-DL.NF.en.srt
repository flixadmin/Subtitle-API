{\an8}Today, the future has arrived.

00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:17,017
Our city has seen incredible,
impossible things.

00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:21,521
Meta-humans, men and women
with extraordinary abilities.

7
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:27,027
The ability to soar above buildings,
to run faster than the speed of light.

8
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:30,030
Unfortunately, most of these meta-humans

9
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:33,325
have chosen the wrong path
with these powers. A dark path.

running may have scrambled your brain.

You take no responsibility for
the wreckage your mistakes have caused.

truly help me do something about it.

-Hi.

46

{\an8}So, let me get this straight.

47
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:49,001
{\an8}You're the doppelganger
of the man who murdered his mom

48
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:52,589
{\an8}and is responsible for both
Ronnie and Eddie's deaths.

49
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:55,425
{\an8}Yeah, but he's not even the doppelganger
of the Dr. Wells that we knew,

50
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:58,177
{\an8}because that Dr. Wells' body
had been taken over by the Reverse-Flash

Eddie's distant relative from the future.

00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,353
Yeah, I didn't follow any of that.
I'm my own man.

53
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,021
I had nothing to do with the murder
of your mother, or your friend Ricky.

But I want to run some tests on you.

another speedster in the multi-verse.

all with the same goal.

{\an8}but that guy, back in that room,
that's not Wells.

104
00:05:44,176 --> 00:05:47,514
{\an8}Dr. McGee swore she saw Wells.
He broke into Mercury Labs.

105
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,181
{\an8}What? Why didn't you tell me this?

106
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:52,268
{\an8}Because I didn't believe her. I didn't
even want to consider Wells was alive.

107
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:56,523

he's here to help us stop Zoom.

-How can you even look at him?
-You think this is easy for me?

110

I'm just gonna call him "Harry."

00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:04,296
I guess we will. One more thing...

302
00:16:04,796 --> 00:16:07,967
You said you're gonna
re-task S.T.A.R. Labs' satellite?

303
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,302
To scan for solar emissions, yeah.
We're up and running.

304
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,804
I'd like to examine your program.
I wanna see if it works.

305
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,806
Don't worry. It'll work.

306
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,983
Harry's starting to get on my nerves.

307
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,443
The silent alarm just went off
at the Bank of Central City.

308
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,736
That's gotta be Dr. Light.

309
00:16:27,944 --> 00:16:28,988
Could be a trap.

310
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,948
Barry, trust me, Dr. Light
is not a killer. You can talk to her.

311
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,492
Okay.

312
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,339
Looking for this?

313
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,425
I know Zoom sent you here to kill me.

314
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,510
Good news. You don't have to do that.

315
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,512
Not if I can get out of town
with that cash.

316
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,348
And then what? Zoom's not gonna like
that you ditched him, right?

317
00:16:56,848 --> 00:16:58,017
My friends and I can help you.

318
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,851
Nobody can protect me from Zoom.

319
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,355
All right. Why don't we
take it down a lumen,

320
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:08,110
have a normal conversation, all right?
Thank you.

321
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,200
Linda? Linda Park?

322
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,035
How do you know my name?

323
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,453
I don't understand.

324
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,538
This was a mistake.

325
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,790
(BARRY GROANS)

326
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,712
CAITLIN: <i>Barry, what's happening?</i>

327
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,172
I can't see.

328
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,049
Guys, I can't see.

329
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:34,886
BARRY: <i>I still can't see.</i>

330
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,388
How long is this gonna last?

331
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:38,682
You're suffering from solar retinopathy.

332
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:42,311
Your retinas are severely damaged.
You're lucky you're not permanently blind.

333
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:45,397
But with your rapid regeneration
abilities, your sight should return soon.

334
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,233
HARRISON: <i>6.25 hours,
by my estimation.</i>

335
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,318
All this could have been avoided
if you'd just stopped Light

336
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:50,694
instead of chit-chatting with her.

337
00:17:50,902 --> 00:17:52,028
She caught Barry off guard.

338
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:53,864
Always an excuse with you, right?

339
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,200
He's the fastest man alive.
How could she possibly do that?

340
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:59,870
Because Light looks exactly
like my ex-girlfriend. Linda Park.

341
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,082
That's why Zoom sent her.
Because he knew you'd hesitate.

342
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:06,418
Well, that means Zoom had to have known,
somehow, that Linda was your ex?

343
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:08,170
Which is why Barry has to act now,

344
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:10,256
before Zoom sends another double
from Barry's life.

345
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,758
All right. Right now,
I'm more worried about Linda.

346
00:18:12,924 --> 00:18:15,719
When I saw who was under the mask,
I said her name.

347
00:18:15,927 --> 00:18:17,096
What if Light didn't even realize

348
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:19,681
that she had a doppelganger here
until I accidentally told her?

349
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,017
The first thing that Atom Smasher did
when he crossed the breach

350
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,685
was to kill his doppelganger.

351
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,437
Yeah, but Light's not like Atom Smasher.

352
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,106
We should keep an eye on your Linda.

353
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,899
All right. I'll go.

354
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:30,442
-Sorry.
-Bro.

355
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:31,943
-Barry.
-What?

356
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:35,947
Okay, okay. You can't do anything, uh,
until your sight returns.

357
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,410
No, no, no. Come on.
Here's the little rail here. I'll do it.

358
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:40,786
-BARRY: Mmm-hmm.
-I'll go with you.

359
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,622
-Hey, Barry! I came as soon as I...
-Hey.

360
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:47,376
You look just like him.

361
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,920
I'm guessing my counterpart
did something to offend her as well?

362
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,131
Her fiancé died because of him.

363
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:53,799
Oh.

364
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:01,307
Iris, I know it's weird seeing him.

365
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:04,643
Yes. It's just a lot to process lately.
Wells, my mother...

366
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,438
How are you doing with that, by the way?

367
00:19:08,104 --> 00:19:12,108
I mean, now that she's gone, okay.

368
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,237
Yeah. Iris, um...

369
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,489
-Yeah. (CHUCKLES)
-Look, thanks.

370
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:19,783
You know you can talk to me about it.

371
00:19:19,991 --> 00:19:22,828
Yeah, I know, but...
But really, I'm fine, okay?

372
00:19:22,994 --> 00:19:24,580
I should be asking how you're doing.

373
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,832
-(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)
-That's me. I got it.

374
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,501
-Barry, let me help you.
-I got it. All right.

375
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:34,340
Uh... "Running a little late. P." Who's P?

376
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:39,178
-Oh, P. That's Patty.
-My dad's partner, Patty?

377
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,180
-Mmm-hmm.
-What is she running late for?

378
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,598
Um...

379
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,350
Our first date.

380
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,436
-That's so great. She's great.
-Uh...

381
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:49,313
Yeah, no, Patty is great.
I just, you know,

382
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,524
I doubt she's gonna give me another shot
when I have to cancel on her.

383
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:53,859
Don't cancel.

384
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:57,863
I'm blind, Iris. A literal "blind date."
That's not gonna work.

385
00:19:58,029 --> 00:19:59,531
Hey, we are in S.T.A.R. Labs. Come on.

386
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:02,284
There's got to be something here
that can help you get through the night.

387
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:03,535
Yeah.

388
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,955
Or someone.

389
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,877
Cisco. Hey.

390
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:13,879
To your left. Other left.

391
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,214
Cisco.

392
00:20:21,177 --> 00:20:22,221
I'm sorry.

393
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,142
Oh. Sorry.

394
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,853
Okay. She's two steps in front of you.

395
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,357
-Nice glasses. (CHUCKLES)
-Hey. Hey.

396
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,901
-BARRY: <i>I'm so, so sorry I'm late.</i>
-Touchdown.

397
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,737
No, don't be. Uh, you know,
I actually judge my dates

398
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,490
on whether or not they stand me up.
So you are off to a great start.

399
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:43,199
What do you mean?
I mean, who would stand you up?

400
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:44,535
Oh, I have a reputation.

401
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,914
Not that kind of reputation.
That's not what I meant.

402
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,916
(LAUGHS) That's embarrassing.

403
00:20:51,082 --> 00:20:53,919
You know, I actually, um,
I arrested a boyfriend once.

404
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,255
A very ex-boyfriend,
while we were at dinner.

405
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:59,508
He got really wasted
and decided to insult the waitress.

406
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,760
So I cited him for public intoxication.

407
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:03,720
-That is hilarious.
-Yeah. (LAUGHS) Special.

408
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:07,849
So...

409
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,103
<i>Dude, she looks amazing. You have
to tell her how amazing she looks.</i>

410
00:21:13,104 --> 00:21:14,440
You look amazing, Patty.

411
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,108
Uh, thanks. I actually
had a really hard time

412
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,610
trying to figure out what to wear.

413
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:22,448
Like, if I should wear a dress or this
color was a little weird. I couldn't...

414
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:27,578
No, you look great. It's, um... Yeah, no,
what would you call that color?

415
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,413
Um, uh...

416
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,623
-I don't know.
-I can't tell. The feed's black and white!

417
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:35,126
Yeah, whatever it is, that color
should thank you for wearing it.

418
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,045
(CHUCKLES) My man!

419
00:21:37,253 --> 00:21:39,548
-It's smooth.
-Not smooth.

420
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:40,882
(BOTH LAUGHING)

421
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,302
Oh, wine list! Here we go.

422
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,136
Uh...

423
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:47,431
Yes, oh, got it. Thank you.

424
00:21:48,264 --> 00:21:49,308
Um...

425
00:21:51,142 --> 00:21:53,103
-You know, why, why don't you... Sorry.
-Oh! That's okay.

426
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,314
The guy always picks.
Why don't you choose?

427
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:58,650
Yeah. What do you want? Red or white?

428
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:00,986
Whatever you'd like. Uh...

429
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:03,780
You've got this. Why do you even need me?

430
00:22:12,163 --> 00:22:13,665
-Here you go.
-JAY: Thank you.

431
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:15,834
-Classic stakeout fuel.
-Yeah.

432
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,669
You have coffee on your Earth, right?

433
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:20,506
I think coffee is the one constant
in the multi-verse.

434
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,757
(CHUCKLES)

435
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:23,592
So, I don't mean to pry,

436
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:29,180
but when Wells keeps referring
to you and Zoom, what's he talking about?

437
00:22:29,347 --> 00:22:32,851
I've fought Zoom many times,
each time barely escaping with my life.

438
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:39,024
(SIGHS) So, yeah. Maybe I didn't always
confront him when I should have.

439
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,651
<i>The truth is, Zoom scared me.</i>

440
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,319
He stole the most precious thing from me,
my speed.

441
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,865
I didn't want Barry
to suffer the same fate.

442
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:50,035
Well, maybe if you just sat down
with Wells, talk to him about it?

443
00:22:50,201 --> 00:22:52,454
No, no, no. Do not trust Wells, Caitlin.

444
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:54,289
The guy was more than happy to make money

445
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,291
off the meta-human problem
with his tech apps.

446
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,043
<i>So now he's obsessed with Zoom.</i>

447
00:22:58,209 --> 00:23:00,546
Something has changed,
and not just because I disappeared.

448
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:06,510
Well, I don't trust Wells. I trust you.

449
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:09,555
(CHUCKLES)

450
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:10,806
(PATTY LAUGHS)

451
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:12,891
So I've actually been dying to ask you.

452
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,810
What was it like
to be struck by lightning?

453

Did it hurt?

455
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:23,569
I mean, all I really remember is feeling
electricity surging through my body.

I actually drowned.

462
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:46,592
I hit my head on the diving board
and fell into the swimming pool.

Uh, my heart stopped for,
I think, two minutes

until my dad rescued me
and saved my life. Yeah.

I've been through a few things in my life

that taught me
not to be afraid of anything.

468

from being who they should be.

00:31:54,745 --> 00:31:56,039
He's a meta-human.

611
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:03,879
Cisco, have you known about this?
And you didn't say anything to us?

612
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:06,799
Yeah, I was going to tell you.
Thanks a lot, Harry.

613
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:10,095
I swear. I was, but I didn't.

614
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:14,057
I was just... I was afraid.

615
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,433
Afraid of what?

616
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,562
Dr. Wells said
the dark matter gave me this, this gift.

617
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:22,773
He said that one day I'd thank him for it.

618
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:26,069
What if I become like him?

619
00:32:26,652 --> 00:32:29,614
Cisco, I don't think any of us
would become evil

620
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:32,908
if we all of a sudden got powers.
Even if they were from Dr. Wells.

621
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:35,954
Yeah. Maybe you're right.

622
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:40,750
I should have said something.
That's my fault. I'm sorry.

623
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,460
Well, you can be sorry later.

624
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:45,463
Because right now, we have to use
your powers to find Dr. Light.

625
00:32:45,671 --> 00:32:48,633
Cisco, your abilities, how do they work?

626
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:52,470
Uh, I get these feelings sometimes.
These vibes.

627
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:55,348
Visions of the breachers when
they come to this Earth.

628
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:59,310
I just... I'm not sure what triggers it.
And sometimes it just happens.

629
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:02,272
Sometimes, it's when
I'm touching something of theirs.

exactly the answer I was looking for.</i>

You need to confuse her.
Give her more than one target
