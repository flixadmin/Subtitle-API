She really cares about you, Barry,

329
00:13:11,464 --> 00:13:14,698
and she's just wondering
why you've been so guarded.

330
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,133
And what did you tell her?

331
00:13:16,135 --> 00:13:18,769

Central City Museum

is hosting a special
black tie event tonight

364

showcasing "The Crystal Ball."

365
00:14:44,198 --> 00:14:46,065
It's a famous painting, apparently,

366
00:14:46,067 --> 00:14:47,900
recently recovered from Markovia.

367
00:14:47,902 --> 00:14:49,502
The painting is on loan to the museum

368
00:14:49,504 --> 00:14:50,803
from the Silverberg family.

369
00:14:50,805 --> 00:14:52,505
Jacob Silverberg himself said,

370
00:14:52,507 --> 00:14:55,241
"The painting's safe
return means more to us

than all the money in the world.

372
00:14:57,044 --> 00:14:58,944
It's like they're begging Turtle to rob it.

373
00:14:58,946 --> 00:15:01,180
Okay, yes. This is a plan.

374
00:15:01,182 --> 00:15:04,216
So the Turtle will make his move,

375
00:15:04,218 --> 00:15:07,453
and we can be there
waiting to take him down.

Is that a bad idea? What do we think?

414
00:16:27,068 --> 00:16:30,970
I will say, she put bullets
in King Shark and Harry.

415
00:16:30,972 --> 00:16:32,338
- Yeah.
- So as far as I'm concerned,

416
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,606
that's Team Flash material to me.

417
00:16:33,608 --> 00:16:35,641
All right, yes. Thank you, Cisco.

418
00:16:35,643 --> 00:16:37,676
Yeah, thank you. Cool.

419
00:16:37,678 --> 00:16:39,278
I'm gonna do this...

420
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,046
I'm gonna tell her.

421
00:16:43,284 --> 00:16:46,285
Don't tell her.

422
00:16:46,287 --> 00:16:47,720

That's nice.

425
00:16:55,596 --> 00:16:58,597
Then keep her as far away
from this as possible.

426
00:16:58,599 --> 00:17:00,099
And here's why.

427
00:17:00,101 --> 00:17:03,802
If Zoom finds out who you care for,

428
00:17:03,804 --> 00:17:05,771
who you love,

429
00:17:05,773 --> 00:17:08,240

Now's not really an awesome time.

826
00:38:39,548 --> 00:38:41,281
I have a mound of paperwork
on my desk I need to finish,

827
00:38:41,283 --> 00:38:42,516
so I'm sorry, I can't.

828
00:38:42,518 --> 00:38:43,984
No, no, okay. Real... really quick.

829
00:38:43,986 --> 00:38:46,053
Um, so you were right.

830
00:38:46,055 --> 00:38:48,288
You were right about everything.

831
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:50,090
Um, I've been closed off and weird,

832
00:38:50,092 --> 00:38:53,060
and, um, all the things
that you said I was.

833
00:38:53,062 --> 00:38:56,997
But mostly, I have not been honest.

Barry, um...

835
00:38:59,969 --> 00:39:01,668
I'm leaving Central City.

00:39:05,441 --> 00:39:06,673
What?

837
00:39:06,675 --> 00:39:11,011
Um, before Mardon, and before my dad...

838
00:39:11,013 --> 00:39:12,713
before everything...

839
00:39:12,715 --> 00:39:15,649
I always wanted to be a CSI.

840
00:39:15,651 --> 00:39:17,284
And four years ago, I was accepted

841
00:39:17,286 --> 00:39:18,619
into the Forensic Science program

842
00:39:18,621 --> 00:39:22,256
at Midway City University.

843
00:39:22,258 --> 00:39:23,991
That's a really great school.

844
00:39:23,993 --> 00:39:25,058
Yeah.

845
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:27,127
Yeah, I know, I just, uh...

846
00:39:27,129 --> 00:39:28,495
I didn't go.

847
00:39:28,497 --> 00:39:31,064
You know, I deferred to become a cop and...

848
00:39:31,066 --> 00:39:34,067
catch my dad's killer.

849
00:39:34,069 --> 00:39:36,870
And I've done that.

850
00:39:36,872 --> 00:39:39,506
So, um...

851
00:39:39,508 --> 00:39:42,643
so it's time to move on.

852
00:39:42,645 --> 00:39:44,645
