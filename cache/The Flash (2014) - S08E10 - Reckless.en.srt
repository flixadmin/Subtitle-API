with flames that generate
a cold so intense, it burns?

219
00:09:02,716 --> 00:09:04,843
That last item is almost
an exact description

220
00:09:04,846 --> 00:09:06,411
of how cold fusion works.

221
00:09:06,414 --> 00:09:08,981
But why is the fire attracted to Frost?

222
00:09:08,983 --> 00:09:11,244
I believe it's because her meta-abilities

223
00:09:11,246 --> 00:09:14,639
are cryo-kinetic, just
like our cold fusion fire.

224
00:09:14,641 --> 00:09:18,338
So you think it's hunting her
for fuel to recharge itself?

225
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,339
Correct.

226
00:09:19,341 --> 00:09:20,929
So the key to catching it

227
00:09:20,932 --> 00:09:23,676
is to wait until it comes after
her again and then trap it.

228
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:25,432
Frost, we're not using you as bait.

00:09:29,394 --> 00:09:30,872
Why won't you at least let us try?

232
00:09:30,874 --> 00:09:32,867
Because this feels like a last resort.

233
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:35,007
Besides, there's still so much
we don't know about this fire.

234
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:37,009
I mean, even if we tried this,

235
00:09:37,011 --> 00:09:38,532
we still have no way to capture it.

236
00:09:38,534 --> 00:09:40,490
Cold fusion is still a fusion reaction,

237
00:09:40,492 --> 00:09:43,232
one that occurs at a low
molecular temperature.

238
00:09:43,234 --> 00:09:46,584
If we could build some kind of
fusion containment housing...

239
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,630
Then all we'd need to do
is recalibrate the unit

240
00:09:49,632 --> 00:09:52,198
to absorb and amplify Frost's
cryo-kinetic signature.

241
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,940
Yes. Then as long as
Frost is in proximity,

242
00:09:54,942 --> 00:09:57,725
the unit can amplify her
cryo-kinetic signature

243
00:09:57,727 --> 00:09:59,118
and attract the fire,

244
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,122
allowing us to capture and imprison it.

245
00:10:03,124 --> 00:10:04,689
Of course, building a unit like that

246
00:10:04,691 --> 00:10:07,126
could take weeks or longer, but...

247
00:10:07,128 --> 00:10:11,817
Well, not that I'm saying
we should do this at all,

have what you're describing.
