1
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,250
Check it out.

2
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:34,039
What are you doing here?

3
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:41,047
I said, what are you doing here?

4
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,007
I want to see what he's made of.

5
00:14:40,825 --> 00:14:42,841
Our instructions were
to break him down...

6
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,923
...not kill him.

7
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:47,288
Some guys break different than others.

8
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,893
So now let's see how tough you are.

9
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,598
Where is he?

10
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,223
He's heading towards the north passage.
He's closed the gate.

11
00:17:43,225 --> 00:17:45,374
Run. He's getting away. Hurry!

12
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,067
Lights ready, Act One preset.

13
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:06,830
Final preparations complete.
Everyone standby please.

14
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,699
What was that?

15
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,215
I don't know.

16
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,073
It's just a flesh wound.

17
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,202
Seal the building. Close the exits.

18
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,198
If anything were to happen to you...

19
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,145
Nothing's going to happen to me.

20
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,149
Stop the car!

21
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:00,718
Your card isn't working.

22
01:58:08,975 --> 01:58:10,893
Now let's see what you're made of.
