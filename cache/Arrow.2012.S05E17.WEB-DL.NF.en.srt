640
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:16,419
YEAH. WHAT WAS IT I SAID
TO YOU THEN?

641
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:18,130
LIVING IS NOT
FOR THE WEAK.

642
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:20,966
I CANNOT BELIEVE SCARED BOY
IN CELL BESIDE ME

643
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:23,635
WOULD BE ONE TO KILL
KONSTANTIN KOVAR.

644
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:25,011
WELL, THAT WASN'T ME.

645
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:27,555
THAT WAS HIM.

646
00:38:27,597 --> 00:38:29,432
THAT IS A LIE YOU TELL
YOURSELF,

647
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:33,228
AN EXCUSE THAT ALLOWS YOU
TO KILL.

648
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:34,771
YOU KILL BECAUSE YOU
LIKE IT.

649
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:37,649
THAT'S NOT TRUE,
ANATOLY. I HATE IT.

650
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,276
AND I THINK MAYBE
YOU'VE HAD

651
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,735
A BIT TOO MUCH
TO DRINK.

652
00:38:40,777 --> 00:38:42,654
WELL, THAT IS ENTIRELY
POSSIBLE.

653
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,197
BUT IN THIS CASE,
I AM RIGHT.

654
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:47,993
THIS DEAL YOU
SOLD YOURSELF ON,

655
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:51,955
THAT THIS HOOD IS GOING
TO KEEP THIS MONSTER OF YOURS

656
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:53,957
AT BAY,

657
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:57,127
SOMEDAY IS GOING
TO FALL APART.

658
00:38:57,169 --> 00:39:00,297
AND WHEN IT DOES, YOU'RE
NOT GOING TO LIKE

659
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,215
THE MAN YOU SEE UNDERNEATH.

660
00:39:09,139 --> 00:39:10,598
WELL?

661
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,352
WILL TAKE WEEKS UNTIL
HE'S BACK ON HIS FEET,

662
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:16,521
BUT HE'LL LIVE.

663
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:19,274
HE GIVES YOU HIS THANKS.

664
00:39:19,316 --> 00:39:21,276
JUST OUT OF MORBID
CURIOSITY,

665
00:39:21,318 --> 00:39:23,402
WHO DID THIS TO HIM?

666
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:25,738
THAT'S HIS BUSINESS.

667
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:32,078
WELL, WHOEVER IT IS,
I'M GLAD I'M NOT HIM.

668
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,753
[BIRDS CHIRPING]

669
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:17,582
JOHN: HOW MUCH LONGER?

670
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:18,708
"HOW MUCH LONGER"?

671
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:19,876
WE LITERALLY HAD TO
REROUTE

672
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:21,627
THE ELECTRO-OPTICAL
DIGITAL IMAGING

673
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,171
FROM EVERY RECONNAISSANCE
SATELLITE I COULD
GAIN ACCESS TO.

674
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:25,340
CURTIS: THEN WE
HAD TO CAPTURE DATA

675
00:40:25,382 --> 00:40:27,675
IN A 4-DIMENSIONAL
ARRAY, WHICH COULD
THEN BE PARSED

676
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:29,344
USING A REAL-TIME
ALGORITHM.

677
00:40:29,386 --> 00:40:31,388
BASICALLY, SOLVING
COLD FUSION

678
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,430
WOULD HAVE BEEN
EASIER.

679
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:33,973
JOHN: OK. I'M SORRY.

680
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:35,683
I'VE JUST BEEN AT THIS SO LONG,
I DON'T KNOW WHICH WAY IS UP.

681
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:37,852
AND OLIVER'S BEEN GONE
FOR 6 DAYS AND...

682
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:39,645
AND WHAT?

683
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,356
OLIVER? OH, MY GOD.

684
00:40:41,398 --> 00:40:42,648
JOHN: OLIVER?

685
00:40:49,406 --> 00:40:51,574
CHASE HAD ME...

[GROANS]

687
00:40:54,411 --> 00:40:56,204
AND HE LET ME GO.

688
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,168
GO SLOW, MAN.

689
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:06,589
IT'S OVER.

690
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:08,258
OLIVER, WE'RE GONNA GET
THIS SON OF A BITCH

691
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:11,261
FOR WHATEVER HE DID TO YOU.

692
00:41:11,303 --> 00:41:13,430
JOHN, IT'S...

693
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:18,768
IT...IT...IT'S OVER
FOR ME.

694
00:41:21,354 --> 00:41:23,356
I DON'T WANT TO DO
THIS ANYMORE.

695
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:28,778
I'M SHUTTING
EVERYTHING DOWN.
