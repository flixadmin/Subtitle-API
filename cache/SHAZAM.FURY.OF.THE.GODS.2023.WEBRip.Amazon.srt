5
00:01:08,155 --> 00:01:10,679
[docent] The lore tells us
of a valiant few

6
00:01:10,722 --> 00:01:13,377
who stood above the fray
and fog.

7
00:01:13,421 --> 00:01:15,988
My, what weapons
they must have wielded.

8
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:18,252
Which brings us
to our current exhibit,

9
00:01:18,295 --> 00:01:20,950
the mythical staff
of the gods.

10
00:01:20,993 --> 00:01:22,647
In Homer's tale,

11
00:01:22,691 --> 00:01:26,956
the staff was said to harness
the gift of all gods.

12
00:01:26,999 --> 00:01:30,002
Oh. [chuckles]
Welcome, proud soldiers.

13
00:01:30,046 --> 00:01:31,134
What did I say?

14
00:01:31,178 --> 00:01:32,614
Museums are fun.

15
00:01:32,657 --> 00:01:35,573
Amusement parks
for the brains. [laughs]

16
00:01:35,617 --> 00:01:37,314
-Whoa!
-[docent] Okay,

17
00:01:37,358 --> 00:01:38,707
there's no reason
to get pushy.

18
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,144
Everyone will get a chance
to see it.

20
00:01:42,667 --> 00:01:45,148

21
00:01:45,192 --> 00:01:47,455
the two halves
of this ancient replica

22
00:01:47,498 --> 00:01:49,761
were recently discovered in,
of all places,

23
00:01:49,805 --> 00:01:53,374
a waste processing plant
outside of Philadelphia.

24
00:01:53,417 --> 00:01:54,810
So strong,
they reportedly broke

25
00:01:54,853 --> 00:01:56,768
-three trash compactors.
-[thuds]

26
00:01:56,812 --> 00:01:59,075
Okay, um, friends,
that's enough.

27
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,469
I'm, I'm sort of the star
of the show here... [gasps]

65
00:05:00,778 --> 00:05:02,911
Turns out museums are fun.

66
00:05:06,871 --> 00:05:08,525
Let's have more of it.

67
00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:11,659
We can do nothing while
the staff remains sundered.

68
00:05:11,702 --> 00:05:14,183
The champions of this realm
outnumber us.

69
00:05:14,226 --> 00:05:17,360
Human champions
are still humans

70
00:05:17,404 --> 00:05:19,144
and we are gods.

71
00:05:19,188 --> 00:05:22,060
Do not underestimate
the judgement of the wizard.

72
00:05:22,104 --> 00:05:24,367
To protect the power
of the gods,

73
00:05:24,411 --> 00:05:27,152
he will have chosen
with meticulous precision

74
00:05:27,196 --> 00:05:30,982
the strongest, most keenly
intelligent champions

75
00:05:31,026 --> 00:05:33,376
this realm has ever witnessed.

76
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,944
I'm an idiot.

77
00:05:35,987 --> 00:05:38,033
I don't deserve these powers,
if I'm being honest.

78
00:05:38,076 --> 00:05:39,774
Like, what am I even
contributing?

79
00:05:39,817 --> 00:05:41,689
There's already a superhero
with a red suit,

80
00:05:41,732 --> 00:05:42,864
with a lightning bolt on it

81
00:05:42,907 --> 00:05:44,996
and I'm fast, but he's faster.

82
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,739
Aquaman is literally huge,
and he's so manly

83
00:05:48,783 --> 00:05:50,132
and Batman is so cool!

84
00:05:50,175 --> 00:05:52,264
And I'm just me.

85
00:05:52,308 --> 00:05:53,701
And I can't say this
to anyone else,

86
00:05:53,744 --> 00:05:55,224
'cause my family looks to me
as a leader,

87
00:05:55,267 --> 00:05:57,139
but I feel like

88
00:05:57,182 --> 00:05:58,314
a fraud.

89
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,663
You understand I'm a...

90
00:06:00,751 --> 00:06:02,144
pediatrician,

91
00:06:04,102 --> 00:06:05,843
right?

92
00:06:05,887 --> 00:06:07,932
I mean, yeah, well,
you were recommended

93
00:06:07,976 --> 00:06:09,673
by another patient,
Billy Batson.

94
00:06:09,717 --> 00:06:11,066
It doesn't matter.

95
00:06:11,109 --> 00:06:12,894
Can you help fix my thoughts
so that

96
00:06:12,937 --> 00:06:14,852
they just, like, you know,
stop happening?

97
00:06:14,896 --> 00:06:16,376
All right, look.

98
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:17,942
And, again, pediatrician,
not a psychiatrist,

99
00:06:17,986 --> 00:06:19,901
but it sounds to me like

100
00:06:19,944 --> 00:06:22,730
you're experiencing
imposter syndrome.

101
00:06:22,773 --> 00:06:26,037
And often, that originates
from trauma early in life,

102
00:06:26,081 --> 00:06:28,518
so if you don't
mind me asking,

103
00:06:28,562 --> 00:06:30,564
how well do you remember
your childhood?

104
00:06:30,607 --> 00:06:32,087
Like it was today. [chuckles]

105
00:06:33,044 --> 00:06:34,959
Trauma? Uh, I don't know.

106
00:06:35,003 --> 00:06:36,483
I mean, I never met my dad.

107
00:06:36,526 --> 00:06:39,964
Uh, my mom abandoned me
at a Christmas carnival.

108
00:06:40,008 --> 00:06:41,488
I spent a lot of time
in the foster system,

109
00:06:41,531 --> 00:06:42,619
ran away from 11 homes,

110
00:06:42,663 --> 00:06:43,925
got into a lot of fights.

111
00:06:43,968 --> 00:06:45,230
Then I was abducted
by a wizard

112
00:06:45,274 --> 00:06:46,754
who gave me superpowers

113
00:06:46,797 --> 00:06:48,451
and then dude just, like,
died in front of my face.

114
00:06:48,495 --> 00:06:49,670
That's not a small amount.

115
00:06:49,713 --> 00:06:51,149
A doctor conjured seven demons

116
00:06:51,193 --> 00:06:52,586
and held my whole family
hostage,

117
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:54,065
so we had to rip out
one of his eyeballs,

118
00:06:54,109 --> 00:06:55,850
and then everybody
got superpowers,

119
00:06:55,893 --> 00:06:57,634
but now everyone's kind of,
like, doing their own thing

120
00:06:57,678 --> 00:06:59,375
and I'm the only one trying
to keep everybody together.

121
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,378
Okay, okay.
Well, let's just process that.

122
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,902
Right?
Rejected by your parents,

123
00:07:04,946 --> 00:07:06,469
then by the system,

124
00:07:06,513 --> 00:07:09,211
and now rejected by a city
you try to protect.

125
00:07:09,254 --> 00:07:10,865
I never said I was rejected
by my city.

126
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,434
"Rejected by city."

127
00:07:14,477 --> 00:07:16,392
That's the <i>Tribune.</i>
Nobody reads the <i>Tribune.</i>

128
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,134
-I do.
-Anyway, okay, well, um...

129
00:07:19,177 --> 00:07:21,876
I, uh, appreciate your help,
but I got some real problems.

130
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,489
There's this terrorist hostage
situation going on, so...

131
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:28,796
-Hostage situation?
-Yeah.

00:07:56,432 --> 00:07:58,129
I'm telling you.

Besides, you're the one

This is big time.

-We are the guns.
-[Mary] Darla!

151
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:09,532
Why were there Skittles
in my pockets?

152
00:08:09,576 --> 00:08:11,708
It was supposed
to be a surprise.

153
00:08:11,752 --> 00:08:13,362
It was.

154
00:08:13,405 --> 00:08:15,103
Hmm, she's very moody lately.

155
00:08:15,146 --> 00:08:17,105
Why do you think
I put Skittles in her pocket?

156

-Oh.
-[Rosa] Whoo! <i>Ole.</i>

[Victor] Is this an army

-killing Genghis Khan?
-Yes.

159
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,155
Unicorns aren't real.

-Yes.

you would get into it

167

if you gave it a chance.

168
00:08:37,604 --> 00:08:39,867
Yeah, I'm really starting
to see the appeal.

Very urgent melody to it.

00:18:18,836 --> 00:18:20,316
means I'm abandoning
the family.

357
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,883
Oh. Okay, cool,

358
00:18:21,926 --> 00:18:23,841
it's about college again.
I totally get it.

359
00:18:23,885 --> 00:18:25,060
Yeah.

360
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,844
Do you really
not see yourself?

361
00:18:26,888 --> 00:18:27,889
[sighs]

362
00:18:33,938 --> 00:18:35,592
You turn 18 in five months.

363
00:18:35,636 --> 00:18:37,942
They're not gonna kick me out.
They didn't kick you out.

364
00:18:37,986 --> 00:18:40,467
Victor and Rosa
are saints, yes,
but you're about to age out

365
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,382
of the foster system
just like I did.

366
00:18:42,425 --> 00:18:45,167
Yeah, I get it.
I know how it works, okay?

367
00:18:45,211 --> 00:18:46,255
Do you?

368
00:18:47,561 --> 00:18:50,129
Victor and Rosa
can barely pay rent.

369
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:53,044
And the state no longer sends
checks to feed or house me

370
00:18:53,088 --> 00:18:55,134
and soon there will be
no checks for you.

371
00:18:56,483 --> 00:18:59,834
I don't care if Wonder Woman
has a job.

372
00:18:59,877 --> 00:19:01,488
I want to contribute.

373
00:19:01,531 --> 00:19:03,359
At some point, Billy, like

374
00:19:03,403 --> 00:19:05,709
everyone on Earth,
we have to get a job or...

375
00:19:06,449 --> 00:19:07,450
leave home.

376
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:14,979
Nothing lasts forever.

377
00:19:20,898 --> 00:19:23,510
[door opens, closes]

378
00:19:23,553 --> 00:19:26,904
I mean, it's literally called
the Rock of Eternity.

379
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:33,215
So, clearly, some things
do last forever.

380
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:35,261
-[ominous music playing]

381

[footsteps approaching]

382
00:20:08,555 --> 00:20:11,122
[man] Leave me to die.

383
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:14,430
Oh, but we come bearing gifts.

384
00:20:15,866 --> 00:20:17,868
[magic resonating]

385
00:20:25,572 --> 00:20:26,703
Magic.

386
00:20:26,747 --> 00:20:28,575
Impossible.

387
00:20:28,618 --> 00:20:30,838
This realm was sealed off
from magic.

388
00:20:30,881 --> 00:20:35,495
Yes. After you ripped it
from our father's very core.

389
00:20:35,538 --> 00:20:38,280
From every god in this realm.

390
00:20:38,324 --> 00:20:39,803
From me.

391
00:20:39,847 --> 00:20:42,589
[bar sizzling]

392
00:20:42,632 --> 00:20:44,895
Do you not remember
what you took?

393
00:20:44,939 --> 00:20:47,855
What my particular power was?

394
00:20:47,898 --> 00:20:50,336
The power of elements.

395
00:20:50,379 --> 00:20:54,035
No. I cast a barrier
to prevent your kind

396
00:20:54,078 --> 00:20:56,037
from entering the human realm.

397
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,300
The only way that barrier
could be removed is if--

398
00:20:58,344 --> 00:20:59,736
Someone broke this?

399
00:21:01,564 --> 00:21:02,957
How did...

400
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,654
Where is the Champion?

401
00:21:04,698 --> 00:21:07,396
It was your hands that forged
this staff for our father

402
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,790
and yours that will mend it.

403
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:13,010
I told you
I would die before I help you.

404
00:21:15,361 --> 00:21:16,797

405
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,540
[groaning]

406
00:21:31,594 --> 00:21:34,380
Now, say the word.

407
00:21:34,423 --> 00:21:36,643
Never. Never!

408
00:21:36,686 --> 00:21:38,297
Never say never.

409
00:21:45,652 --> 00:21:47,393
Say the word.

410
00:21:47,436 --> 00:21:49,438
[magical voices echoing]

411
00:21:55,139 --> 00:21:57,794

421
00:22:30,784 --> 00:22:33,177
Now we get to have our fun.

422
00:22:33,221 --> 00:22:37,486
Fun is for children, dear.
We are at war.

423

-Oh, my gosh.
-Oh, my goodness.

426
00:22:57,985 --> 00:22:59,029
-I am so sorry!
-I'm so sorry!

427
00:22:59,073 --> 00:23:00,466
No, don't be sorry. I'm sorry!

428
00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:01,597
No, it's totally my fault.
Are you okay?

429
00:23:01,641 --> 00:23:02,642
-I'm okay, yeah.
-Okay, yeah.

430
00:23:02,685 --> 00:23:04,383
-I'm always okay.
-Good.

431
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:07,734
Uh, actually, do you...
do you know where this is?

432
00:23:07,777 --> 00:23:08,952
[voice cracks] Miss Saunders!

433
00:23:08,996 --> 00:23:11,346
[clears throat]
Yeah, absolutely

434
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,913
is what I meant to say.
Voice crack. It's weird.

435
00:23:12,956 --> 00:23:14,610
Oh, no, no worries. If it
makes you feel any better

436
00:23:14,654 --> 00:23:15,872
it's nothing compared
to the amount

437
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:17,178
that you're blushing
right now.

438
00:23:17,221 --> 00:23:18,527
Oh, I blush
when I'm confident.

439
00:23:18,571 --> 00:23:20,094
-[chuckles]
-[Brett] There she is.

440
00:23:20,137 --> 00:23:22,313
-Hey.
-New girl. First period.

441
00:23:22,357 --> 00:23:24,533
-[Anne] Yeah.
-I'm Brett. This is Burke.

442
00:23:24,577 --> 00:23:26,361
Listen, if you need anything
at all,

443
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,276
we're your guys. We got it.

444
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:30,147
[Freddy] Brett
and Burke Breyer.

445
00:23:30,191 --> 00:23:31,671
They got it all. I mean,
what is it, narcissistic
personality disorder,

446
00:23:31,714 --> 00:23:33,542
-chlamydia, they got it.
-[chuckles]

447
00:23:33,586 --> 00:23:35,501
Plenty of it
to go around, too.

448
00:23:35,544 --> 00:23:38,373
This is Thundercrack's
Make-A-Wish kid.

449
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,288
Fanboy here thinks
he's a big boy now.

450
00:23:40,331 --> 00:23:41,724
Yeah, he doesn't know
where he belongs.

451
00:23:41,768 --> 00:23:43,378
Sure I do. I don't belong
in that trash can.

452
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,988
'Cause that's... I'll smell
like human garbage,

453
00:23:45,032 --> 00:23:46,947
do you realize that?
And that's your brand, guys!

454
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:48,818

455
00:23:48,862 --> 00:23:50,298
[Brett] Down goes Freeman.

456
00:23:50,341 --> 00:23:51,473
Hey, hey! Look!

457
00:23:52,779 --> 00:23:55,303
-Now I'm a superhero.
-Nice!

[clearing throat]

459
00:23:57,871 --> 00:23:59,742
What is this thing doing here?

00:23:59,786 --> 00:24:01,265
-Janitors.
-[groaning]

461
00:24:01,309 --> 00:24:02,441
[Brett] Get up, man.
What are you doin'?

462
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:03,833
-Come on.
-[Freddy grunts]

463
00:24:03,877 --> 00:24:05,226
You're gonna want
to get this fixed, huh?

464
00:24:05,269 --> 00:24:07,228
Yeah, that's probably
why you fell.

465
00:24:07,271 --> 00:24:08,795
[Burke] Yeah.
[Brett] Bye, new girl.

466
00:24:08,838 --> 00:24:10,013
Jeez, thanks Mr. Geckle.

467
00:24:10,057 --> 00:24:11,624
Don't sweat it. That trash can

468
00:24:11,667 --> 00:24:13,321
was like a second home to me
when I went here.

469
00:24:13,364 --> 00:24:14,365
[Freddy chuckles]

470
00:24:15,802 --> 00:24:17,238
Hey.

471
00:24:17,281 --> 00:24:18,848
You knew those guys
were gonna hit you,

472
00:24:18,892 --> 00:24:20,763
but you stepped in anyway.

473
00:24:20,807 --> 00:24:22,983
You know something?
That's how I amuse myself.

474
00:24:23,026 --> 00:24:24,288
The funnier I am,

475
00:24:24,332 --> 00:24:26,987
[grunts] the more
I get punched.

476
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,292
[both chuckling]

477
00:24:28,336 --> 00:24:29,642
Well, it made me laugh.

478
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:31,861
So...

479
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,737
-[chuckles]
-Hero.

00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:40,479
[mouthing]

481
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:44,178
You gonna walk me to class,
or what?

482
00:24:44,221 --> 00:24:45,527
Why would I...
Walk you to class? No.

483
00:24:45,571 --> 00:24:47,660
Why would I wanna do that?
Yes!

484
00:24:47,703 --> 00:24:49,096
Thanks. [chuckles]

485
00:24:49,879 --> 00:24:51,490
So, from the top.

486
00:24:51,533 --> 00:24:54,667
What is Thundercrack's
Make-A-Wish kid?

487
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:58,758
Yeah. Um, it's real inside
baseball, but basically,

488
00:24:58,801 --> 00:25:01,282
a while ago I happened
to have some lunch

489
00:25:01,325 --> 00:25:03,284
in the cafeteria
with a few superheroes.

490
00:25:03,327 --> 00:25:06,330
Wait, the kid who's friends
with superheroes.

491
00:25:06,374 --> 00:25:07,723
-That was you?
-Yeah.

492
00:25:07,767 --> 00:25:09,551
And they're still dicks
to you?

493
00:25:09,595 --> 00:25:10,987
Sadly, just 'cause
you know someone cool,

494
00:25:11,031 --> 00:25:13,468
doesn't really necessarily
make you cool.

495
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:14,817
You seem pretty cool to me.

496
00:25:17,603 --> 00:25:18,604
[loudly] Freddy!

497
00:25:20,606 --> 00:25:22,085
Is my name.

498
00:25:22,129 --> 00:25:24,871
Sorry, that was weird
and loud. I'm Freddy,

499
00:25:24,914 --> 00:25:26,525
he said in a normal voice.

500
00:25:26,568 --> 00:25:27,526
I'm Anne.

501
00:25:29,615 --> 00:25:30,877

Hey, you gotta fix
that crutch, bro!

505
00:25:35,185 --> 00:25:36,186
[chuckles]

506
00:25:36,709 --> 00:25:38,145
What?

507
00:25:38,188 --> 00:25:39,189
[sighs]

508
00:25:41,148 --> 00:25:42,497

[speaking other language]

514
00:26:13,746 --> 00:26:17,619
[in English] Good, little one.
Well done.

515
00:26:17,663 --> 00:26:20,535
Now go find me the one
responsible for this.

516
00:26:22,711 --> 00:26:24,670
[captivating music playing]

00:26:36,246 --> 00:26:37,639
[cork pops]

518
00:26:37,683 --> 00:26:39,685
Wow. Um... [chuckles]

519
00:26:39,728 --> 00:26:42,644
I'm flattered
that you feel this way.

520
00:26:42,688 --> 00:26:45,560
Truly, I mean, you know, like,
look at all this, you know...

Romantic setting

522
00:26:47,823 --> 00:26:50,304
and fancy champagne,
big plates, tiny food.

523
00:26:50,347 --> 00:26:51,827
I mean, you went all out.

524
00:26:52,828 --> 00:26:54,961
I love that, I, I, I, I do.

525
00:26:55,004 --> 00:26:56,658
I'm just not sure

526
00:26:56,702 --> 00:26:58,660
that I'm really ready
to commit right now, you know.

527
00:26:58,704 --> 00:27:01,315
Wait, wait, wait.
No, this isn't about you.

528
00:27:01,358 --> 00:27:05,841
I promise this is
not about you. Okay?
Look... [chuckles]

529
00:27:05,885 --> 00:27:07,800
I know the whole world wants
to see this happen.

530
00:27:07,843 --> 00:27:09,453
You and me.

531
00:27:09,497 --> 00:27:13,022
The dynamic duo.
The hottie goddies. [chuckles]

532
00:27:13,762 --> 00:27:16,199
She-zam.

533
00:27:16,243 --> 00:27:18,593
I guess I'm just afraid
that I'm...

534
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,900
gonna let 'em all down.
You know?

535
00:27:22,553 --> 00:27:23,598
That I'm gonna let you down.

536
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,736
You know what?
Screw it. Let's try.

537
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:31,998
Let's try this crazy thing.

538
00:27:33,303 --> 00:27:34,304
Maybe we'll, uh...

539
00:27:36,959 --> 00:27:38,613
seal it with a kiss?

540
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,659
[sentimental piano music
playing]

541
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:53,715
-Billy Batson!
-[Shazam screams]

542
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:55,978
You are a fool of a champion.

543
00:27:56,022 --> 00:27:58,111
What the hell...
What the hell is going on?

544
00:27:58,154 --> 00:27:59,460
What happened
to her beautiful face?

545
00:27:59,503 --> 00:28:01,157
Also, aren't you,
like, dead-ass dead?

546
00:28:01,201 --> 00:28:03,420
I bring a warning
from beyond your realm.

547
00:28:03,464 --> 00:28:05,422
The daughters of Atlas
are coming for you.

548
00:28:05,466 --> 00:28:06,685
Daughters of Atlas?

549
00:28:06,728 --> 00:28:08,164
They're coming to unmake
your world

550
00:28:08,208 --> 00:28:11,124
and torture mankind
for all eternity

551
00:28:11,167 --> 00:28:13,866
-in the Pit of Endless Agony.
-Okay, I feel like maybe

552
00:28:13,909 --> 00:28:14,997
I should be writing
all this down.

553
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:16,216
-Quiet!
-Okay, okay.

554
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:18,218
You don't know
what you've done.

555
00:28:18,261 --> 00:28:20,263
I regret ever choosing you.

556
00:28:20,307 --> 00:28:21,961
Because of you,

557
00:28:22,004 --> 00:28:24,006
the barrier between the world
has been brought down.

558
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:25,616
They will be hunting
for you now.

559
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,661
Hunting your family.

560
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,100
[Shazam] Hmm?

561
00:28:31,144 --> 00:28:34,016
Oh, they're coming.
Listen to me, Billy.

562
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,497
The fate of your world
depends on it.

563
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,804
One thing you absolutely
must not allow

564
00:28:38,847 --> 00:28:41,110
the daughters of Atlas
to do is...

565
00:28:41,154 --> 00:28:42,633
-[screams]
-[gasps]

566
00:28:46,072 --> 00:28:48,117
[breathing heavily]

567
00:28:48,161 --> 00:28:50,467
-[mysterious music playing]
-[crackling]

568
00:28:55,995 --> 00:28:57,257
-[shatters]
-[gasps]

569
00:29:01,652 --> 00:29:03,176
Hey, Freddy?

570
00:29:03,219 --> 00:29:04,786
-[dog barking in distance]
-[crickets chirping]

571
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:07,746
[sighs]

572
00:29:14,143 --> 00:29:17,799
[Freddy] Nope, over it.
Done it.

573
00:29:17,843 --> 00:29:20,149
Check fraud? What,
are you kidding me? [gasps]

574
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,804
Armored car heist?

575
00:29:22,848 --> 00:29:25,154
[chuckles] I think I got that
in the bag.

576
00:29:25,198 --> 00:29:27,026
[rock music playing]

577
00:29:27,069 --> 00:29:28,854
-Shazam!
-[lightning cracks]

578
00:29:34,511 --> 00:29:35,512
Whoo!

579
00:29:36,339 --> 00:29:37,340
[Freddy scoffs]

580
00:29:38,994 --> 00:29:40,256
Bon appetit.

581
00:29:41,736 --> 00:29:43,085
Hi.

582
00:29:43,129 --> 00:29:45,784
-Oh, hi! Yes, I mean, hi.
-Hi. [chuckles]

583
00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:47,176
Um, you wanna show me

584
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,048
where you were sitting
when it happened?

585
00:29:51,267 --> 00:29:52,791
Oh, yeah, of course. Totally.

586
00:29:52,834 --> 00:29:54,618
-Yeah. Follow me.
-Okay, yeah.

587
00:29:54,662 --> 00:29:56,882
So, basically,
it's a table down at the end.

588
00:29:56,925 --> 00:29:58,927
[people chattering]

589
00:30:00,929 --> 00:30:02,583
So I was sitting, yeah...

590
00:30:02,626 --> 00:30:05,020
Basically, I was sitting
right here, and he was sitting

591
00:30:05,064 --> 00:30:06,369
right there.

592
00:30:06,413 --> 00:30:07,631
-Here? [chuckles]
-Right there, yeah.

593
00:30:07,675 --> 00:30:09,633
[cell phone vibrates, chimes]

594
00:30:09,677 --> 00:30:11,244
Oh, sorry.
Overbearing brother.

595
00:30:11,287 --> 00:30:13,333
Oh, I have one of those.
Uh, a sister.

596
00:30:13,376 --> 00:30:14,595
Always has to know where I am.

597
00:30:14,638 --> 00:30:15,901
-Right.
-[cell phone chiming]

598
00:30:15,944 --> 00:30:17,293
-I feel that, clearly.
-[chuckles]

599
00:30:17,337 --> 00:30:18,904
Always thinks she knows
better, too.

600
00:30:18,947 --> 00:30:20,470
Even when it's been
factually proven otherwise?

601
00:30:20,514 --> 00:30:22,342
Exactly. And it's not
that I don't love her.

602
00:30:22,385 --> 00:30:24,605
No, of course. It'd just be
nice not to have someone--

603
00:30:24,648 --> 00:30:26,476
Constantly breathing
down your neck.

604
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,304
-From the moment you wake up!
-'Cause I'm not a kid anymore.

605
00:30:28,348 --> 00:30:30,785
No! I'm a month younger,
one month exactly.

606
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,526
And do we have to do
every single thing together?

607
00:30:32,569 --> 00:30:34,658
[both] No!

608
00:30:34,702 --> 00:30:36,747
-[both chuckle]
-[footsteps approaching]

609
00:30:36,791 --> 00:30:38,880
Oh! Billy! What...

610
00:30:38,924 --> 00:30:40,403
What a coinkidink! Um...

611
00:30:40,447 --> 00:30:42,405
I was just telling
my friend Anne

612
00:30:42,449 --> 00:30:45,278
-what a great guy you are.
-We need to talk.

613
00:30:45,321 --> 00:30:46,888
We need to talk.
This guy loves to talk.

614
00:30:46,932 --> 00:30:48,716
-He's a great talker.
-Freddy.

615
00:30:48,759 --> 00:30:50,979
-I have to talk to him.
I'll be right back.
-Okay.

616
00:30:52,807 --> 00:30:54,896
Wait, didn't you tell us
the wizard disintegrated?

617
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,202
The skin peeled off his face.

618
00:30:56,245 --> 00:30:58,073
He turned into a literal
pile of ash.

619
00:30:58,117 --> 00:31:00,249
-Yeah, seems definitive.
-I dunno.

620
00:31:00,293 --> 00:31:03,470
Yeah. Except now
he's in my dreams

621
00:31:03,513 --> 00:31:04,950
and, Freddy, he's trying
to give me a message.

622
00:31:04,993 --> 00:31:06,734
[snaps fingers] Could be
astral projection powers.

623
00:31:06,777 --> 00:31:08,997
-What's that?
-Obi-Wan Kenobi-ing you

624
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:10,825
-from the great beyond?
-That's it, I'm calling

625
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,348
an emergency meeting
after school.

626
00:31:12,392 --> 00:31:14,394
-I want you there.
-Where else am I gonna go?

627
00:31:14,437 --> 00:31:15,786
-What?
-Dude.

628
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:17,919
[Freddy reading indistinctly]

629
00:31:17,963 --> 00:31:20,226
Okay, first of all,
I didn't explode it!

630
00:31:20,269 --> 00:31:21,836
All right? It was already
like that and, and, and...

631
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,272
What is that, the <i>Tribune?</i>
It's fake news!

632
00:31:23,316 --> 00:31:24,839
Freddy, we only have one rule.

633
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,188
[both] All or none.

634
00:31:26,232 --> 00:31:27,581
And it's a stupid rule,
by the way.

635
00:31:27,624 --> 00:31:29,235
I have a girl talking
to me, Billy.

636
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:31,063
A girl. For the first time
in my life!

637
00:31:31,106 --> 00:31:33,021
And I probably don't have
a shot in hell with this girl,

638
00:31:33,065 --> 00:31:34,762
but I'll never find out

639
00:31:34,805 --> 00:31:36,068
if you keep trying to control
everything I wanna do!

640
00:31:36,111 --> 00:31:37,547
Just be at the Rock, Freddy.

641
00:31:37,591 --> 00:31:40,637
[sighs] Okay. Mmm.

642
00:31:40,681 --> 00:31:42,901
By the way, uh,
she has a sister.

643
00:31:42,944 --> 00:31:44,380
Total control freak.

644
00:31:44,424 --> 00:31:45,904
I think you guys
would get along.

645
00:31:45,947 --> 00:31:47,775
Think you'd love her,
actually.

646
00:31:47,818 --> 00:31:48,950
[Shazam] <i>Look, look, look. Fam,</i>

647
00:31:48,994 --> 00:31:50,517
I know it sounds crazy.

648
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,214
And, and obviously
I don't know

649
00:31:52,258 --> 00:31:54,216
exactly what this all means

650
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,914
but, but he was super aggro

651
00:31:55,957 --> 00:31:57,959
and super loud and he was
trying to warn us, I think.

652
00:31:58,003 --> 00:31:59,482
He was yelling about all this

653
00:31:59,526 --> 00:32:00,962
wizard-y mumbo-jumbo
about realms and stuff.

654
00:32:01,006 --> 00:32:03,660
Do you have to talk so loud?

655
00:32:03,704 --> 00:32:05,662
Yeah, Mary, 'cause this is not
that loud.

656
00:32:05,706 --> 00:32:08,448
I think this is
a perfectly acceptable
indoor voice volume.

657
00:32:08,491 --> 00:32:09,928
What is the deal?
Are you okay?

658
00:32:09,971 --> 00:32:12,974
-Yeah.
-Why do you have
sunglasses on?

659
00:32:13,018 --> 00:32:14,410
Did you go to the eye doctor
this morning?

660
00:32:14,454 --> 00:32:16,238
-[snorts]
-[Shazam chuckles]

661
00:32:16,282 --> 00:32:18,849
I dunno, it looks to me like
Mary did go to the eye doctor,

662
00:32:18,893 --> 00:32:21,635
but it was last night,
and she had a lot of fun.

663
00:32:21,678 --> 00:32:24,681
In point of fact,
I did have a great time.

664
00:32:24,725 --> 00:32:27,641
I met other people my age
and I enjoyed myself.

665
00:32:27,684 --> 00:32:29,991
You made friends
at the eye doctor?

666
00:32:30,035 --> 00:32:31,514
No, she...

667
00:32:31,558 --> 00:32:33,038
Yeah, can we get back
on track?

668
00:32:33,081 --> 00:32:34,691
Listen, he's yelling at me

669
00:32:34,735 --> 00:32:36,693
and he's saying the daughters
of Atlas

670
00:32:36,737 --> 00:32:38,652
are coming to hunt us.

671
00:32:38,695 --> 00:32:40,045
So, check out what I found.

672
00:32:40,088 --> 00:32:41,698
"The daughters of Atlas
are the offspring

673
00:32:41,742 --> 00:32:43,004
of the Titan Atlas..."

674
00:32:43,048 --> 00:32:44,527
which is obvious,

675
00:32:44,571 --> 00:32:48,749
but also Nyx, the Goddess
of Night and Death.

676
00:32:48,792 --> 00:32:51,143
Well, good things
can happen at night.

677
00:32:51,186 --> 00:32:52,840
-And death.
-[sighs]

678
00:32:52,883 --> 00:32:54,668
Let me see this.

679
00:32:54,711 --> 00:32:56,713
[intriguing music playing]

680
00:32:59,716 --> 00:33:02,719
"The daughters
guard the mythic Tree of Life

681
00:33:02,763 --> 00:33:06,419
which grows golden apples
that contain the seeds of life

682
00:33:06,462 --> 00:33:08,377
which gave birth
to their realm

683
00:33:08,421 --> 00:33:09,857
protected by a...

684
00:33:10,858 --> 00:33:12,991
-dragon."
-Hey, now.

685
00:33:13,034 --> 00:33:14,166
And I am suddenly here
for this.

686
00:33:14,209 --> 00:33:15,776
I know, right?

687
00:33:15,819 --> 00:33:17,125
'Cause, like, on one hand,
totally terrifying.

688
00:33:17,169 --> 00:33:19,040
-On the other hand, dragon!
-Dragon!

689
00:33:19,084 --> 00:33:20,737
Mary. What are we doin'?

690
00:33:20,781 --> 00:33:23,523
I don't know, man.
This is your meeting.

691
00:33:23,566 --> 00:33:26,091
Right, yes, fine, but we all
need to be on the same page

692
00:33:26,134 --> 00:33:27,875
and, and, and look,

693
00:33:27,918 --> 00:33:30,704
I often think that you think
better than me.

694
00:33:30,747 --> 00:33:34,403
The wizard
did not exactly give me
a tutorial here, guys, okay?

695
00:33:34,447 --> 00:33:36,492
Like, I don't know
how a lot of this stuff works.

696
00:33:36,536 --> 00:33:38,581
That, that room of doors,
or that violin

697
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:41,236
that is, like,
constantly burning
which is super weird but also

698
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,803
definitely keeps
the lair cozy, right?

699
00:33:42,846 --> 00:33:45,893
He didn't even tell me
my superhero name.

700
00:33:45,936 --> 00:33:48,200
And it's not like
I'm not tryin'.

701
00:33:48,243 --> 00:33:50,463
But I really,
really need your help.

702
00:33:51,986 --> 00:33:55,468
Uh, I might know somebody
that can help.

703
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,605
Shut up. That lights up?

704
00:34:02,649 --> 00:34:04,651
[rumbling]

705
00:34:04,694 --> 00:34:06,696
Shut up.

[enchanting music playing]

707
00:34:39,642 --> 00:34:41,514
So, I'm mapping out
the entire lair

708
00:34:41,557 --> 00:34:43,429
and you withhold this?

709
00:34:43,472 --> 00:34:45,083
[Shazam] And you have really
been holding out on us.
Jeez Louise, dude.

710
00:34:47,433 --> 00:34:49,522
-Whoa!
-[Shazam] "Whoa" what?

711
00:34:49,565 --> 00:34:51,176
-"Whoa" what?
-[superhero Darla] Look!

712
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:52,612
-[superhero Darla chuckles]
-Hey, Steve.

713
00:34:54,004 --> 00:34:56,355
[chuckles] What?
You call the pen "Steve"?

714
00:34:56,398 --> 00:34:58,052
Yeah, I thought he looked
like a "Steve."

715
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,706
[superhero Darla] He totally
looks like a "Steve."

716
00:35:01,795 --> 00:35:05,233
-"'Crime and Punishment,'
a book report by Pedro Pena?"
-Yeah.

717
00:35:05,277 --> 00:35:07,714
-[Shazam laughs]
-Pedro.

718
00:35:07,757 --> 00:35:10,673
-Dude, that's cheating.
-I mean, he knows everything.

719
00:35:10,717 --> 00:35:13,154
-Hmm.
-Seriously. Ask him.

720
00:35:13,198 --> 00:35:14,677
You can just ask him stuff?

721
00:35:14,721 --> 00:35:16,157
-Pretty much.
-[Shazam] Slick. Okay, cool.

722
00:35:16,201 --> 00:35:18,899
Steve, we're looking
for information

723
00:35:18,942 --> 00:35:20,944
about the daughters of Atlas.

724
00:35:20,988 --> 00:35:22,990
Can you please help us
with that?

725
00:35:30,258 --> 00:35:32,217
-These are book titles.
-[Shazam] Okay.

726
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,740
Let's just all pick a book,
or something.

727
00:35:33,783 --> 00:35:36,177
Where's Freddy?
I mean, obscure mythology?

728
00:35:36,221 --> 00:35:38,005
Definitely his thing.

729
00:35:38,048 --> 00:35:40,616
I'm not even sure Freddy knows
what his thing is anymore.

730
00:35:42,183 --> 00:35:44,142
[people chattering]

731
00:35:46,231 --> 00:35:48,668
You know I've actually never,
never been up here.

732
00:35:48,711 --> 00:35:51,105
Don't lie. [chuckles]
This is where you hang out

733
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,412
with your superhero friends,
isn't it?

734
00:35:53,455 --> 00:35:55,762
No, actually, why would
they ever have to...
Why would they ever come here?

735
00:35:55,805 --> 00:35:57,459
I mean they have, yes,
they've driven by...

736
00:35:57,503 --> 00:35:59,374
Do you actually know
those guys?

737
00:35:59,418 --> 00:36:02,508
Or is this like
a "Canadian girlfriend"
situation?

738
00:36:02,551 --> 00:36:03,813
Oh, you mean Collette?
Well, she and I

739
00:36:03,857 --> 00:36:05,467
aren't really exclusive,
as of now.

740
00:36:05,511 --> 00:36:06,555
[chuckles]

741
00:36:08,905 --> 00:36:09,906
Do you wanna meet one of them?

742
00:36:10,646 --> 00:36:11,821
Meet, like how?

743
00:36:11,865 --> 00:36:13,214
Like, face-to-face, right now.

744
00:36:14,389 --> 00:36:15,738
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

745
00:36:15,782 --> 00:36:17,087
And today is your lucky day,

746
00:36:17,131 --> 00:36:19,046
because I'm gonna call
the hot one.

747
00:36:19,916 --> 00:36:21,353
Her?

748
00:36:21,396 --> 00:36:22,963
-No, the male hot one.
-Him?

749
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,835
What? Him?

750
00:36:25,879 --> 00:36:27,707
Look, I mean, it's all
subjective, right? But, um...

751
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,839
Captain Everypower usually
tops most online polls

752
00:36:29,883 --> 00:36:31,667
so... It's no big deal.

753
00:36:31,711 --> 00:36:33,669
Is this a joke, Freddy?

754
00:36:33,713 --> 00:36:36,455
'Cause I didn't mean
to make you
actually prove it, really.

755
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,677
No, it's not a joke.
And I'm gonna

756
00:36:41,721 --> 00:36:43,462
call him right now.
I'm gonna call him right now.

757
00:36:43,505 --> 00:36:46,639
So, don't move.
So, stay right there.

758
00:36:46,682 --> 00:36:48,684
Hey, Captain Everypower.
What's goin' on?

759
00:36:48,728 --> 00:36:51,470
It's your boy Freddy. Yeah.

760
00:36:51,513 --> 00:36:52,688
Remember that time
I saved your life?

761
00:36:52,732 --> 00:36:53,863
No, no, no, the other time.

762
00:36:53,907 --> 00:36:55,343
Yeah.

763
00:36:55,387 --> 00:36:57,824
Well, I'm calling in
that favor.

764
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:03,221
[lightning cracks]

You must be Anne.

[gasps] Oh, my God.

768
00:37:12,534 --> 00:37:14,275
Friend of Freddy's, I hear.

769
00:37:14,319 --> 00:37:17,147
I am, actually. Yeah.
How are you...

770
00:37:20,325 --> 00:37:23,066
[sighs] You know, I may be
the one with the superpowers,

771
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,242
but that kid,

772
00:37:24,285 --> 00:37:25,765
he's the real hero.

773
00:37:25,808 --> 00:37:27,897
Yeah. I mean, honestly,

774
00:37:27,941 --> 00:37:29,551
I've never met anyone
like him.

775
00:37:29,595 --> 00:37:31,945
He's... genuine

776
00:37:31,988 --> 00:37:34,687
and warm and funny. [chuckles]

777
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:36,341
-That's a lot of nice things.
-Yeah.

778
00:37:38,299 --> 00:37:39,648
How did you two meet?

779
00:37:39,692 --> 00:37:40,823
Comic Con.

780
00:37:40,867 --> 00:37:42,825
-What's Comic Con?
-What?

781
00:37:42,869 --> 00:37:44,174
[superhero Mary] 
<i>According to this,</i>

782
00:37:44,218 --> 00:37:46,481

783
00:37:46,525 --> 00:37:48,396

785
00:37:51,834 --> 00:37:53,488
[chuckles] Thanks, Steve.

Until the rebellion when
the humans turned on the gods.

787
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:57,666
I'm reading about that
right now.

788
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,320
So, apparently, all of this

789
00:37:59,364 --> 00:38:01,453
revolves around
a powerful weapon.

790
00:38:01,496 --> 00:38:03,455
So Atlas, uh, the father

791
00:38:03,498 --> 00:38:05,761
of the daughters of Atlas,
obviously, yeah,

792
00:38:05,805 --> 00:38:07,633
he crafted a quarterstaff
from the Tree of Life

793
00:38:07,676 --> 00:38:10,331
and he used that staff to
give powers to certain deities

794
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:13,247
but also to take powers away
from others.

795
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:16,772
So, the staff's where Atlas
stored all supernatural power.

796
00:38:16,816 --> 00:38:20,602
Yes, exactly. It's like a,
a battery for magic.

797
00:38:20,646 --> 00:38:22,256
But when things got bad,

798
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,259
a council of human wizards
got together and they

799
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:26,652
stole the staff from Atlas.

800
00:38:26,695 --> 00:38:28,480
And they used that to take
his powers away.

801
00:38:28,523 --> 00:38:30,003
And once they had his magic
they went after other gods...

802
00:38:30,046 --> 00:38:31,483
Guys, that's the wizard!
I know this guy,

803
00:38:31,526 --> 00:38:33,398
this is the wizard
that I know!

804
00:38:33,441 --> 00:38:34,616
What do these say?

805
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,536
"The Wisdom of Solomon,

806
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,277
Strength of Hercules,
Stamina of Atlas,

807
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,931
Power of Zeus,
Courage of Achilles,

808
00:38:44,974 --> 00:38:47,325
Speed of Mercury." These are
the powers they stole.

809
00:38:48,587 --> 00:38:49,588
No.

810
00:38:51,677 --> 00:38:52,721
Whoa, guys, look!

811
00:38:52,765 --> 00:38:54,375
This is what the name means.

812
00:38:54,419 --> 00:38:55,855
Which is way cooler
than what I thought it was,

813
00:38:55,898 --> 00:38:57,857
which is just a bunch
of hot garbage, so.

814
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:01,077
If I may point out one
of the powers
that may be possibly MIA.

815
00:39:01,121 --> 00:39:02,601
Boop.

816
00:39:02,644 --> 00:39:03,732
[Shazam] I'm sorry,

817
00:39:03,776 --> 00:39:05,604
are you very unsubtly implying

818
00:39:05,647 --> 00:39:08,346
that I somehow lack
the wisdom of

819
00:39:08,389 --> 00:39:10,217
-Solo Man?
-Yeah.

820
00:39:11,218 --> 00:39:12,959
Well, maybe it comes later.

821
00:39:13,002 --> 00:39:14,961
I mean you do usually ask Mary
what to do.

822
00:39:15,004 --> 00:39:16,049
-I'm just saying.
-Yeah.

823
00:39:16,092 --> 00:39:17,398
This is very, very hurtful.

824
00:39:17,442 --> 00:39:18,617
I just want you all
to know that.

825
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,140
And it's pronounced "Solomon."

826
00:39:20,183 --> 00:39:21,576
-Oh.
-[Shazam clears throat]

827
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,361
What else
have we learned, fam?

828
00:39:23,404 --> 00:39:27,800
Well, once the staff contained
the powers of the gods,

829
00:39:27,843 --> 00:39:32,195
the wizards apparently
encased the God Realm in some

830
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:34,328
magical sphere

831
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,199
sealing it away forever.

832
00:39:36,243 --> 00:39:38,419
Cut off from magic.

833
00:39:38,463 --> 00:39:40,552
Oh, so that's what
that was about.

834
00:39:40,595 --> 00:39:43,729
Yeah, I don't think that
they are so cut off anymore.

835
00:39:45,948 --> 00:39:48,081
 <i>A bizarre and gruesome scene</i> 
<i>unfolded</i>

837
00:39:49,909 --> 00:39:51,954
 <i>Two women dressed in what </i>
<i>appears to be ancient Greek...</i>

838
00:39:51,998 --> 00:39:54,043
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
that's the wizard's staff.
How did they get that?

839
00:39:54,087 --> 00:39:55,871
So, all those statues
used to be people.

840
00:39:55,915 --> 00:39:59,875
I'm wondering, how did
the staff end up in Europe,

841
00:39:59,919 --> 00:40:01,050
where Greece is at?

842
00:40:02,791 --> 00:40:06,229
Oh, gee-whiz, mister,
sorry I took your cane.

843
00:40:06,273 --> 00:40:07,317
You want it back?

844
00:40:11,104 --> 00:40:13,280
I mean, I did break it in half
and then throw it away.

845
00:40:13,323 --> 00:40:15,587
So, that's probably
where the journey started.

846
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:16,805
-You know?
-What?

847
00:40:16,849 --> 00:40:18,285
What do you mean,
"What?" What?

848
00:40:18,328 --> 00:40:19,895
-You just left it there?
-We were all there.

849
00:40:19,939 --> 00:40:22,071
Guys, I had a staff.
I gave you all superpowers.

850
00:40:22,115 --> 00:40:25,161
You're welcome, by the way.
And then I had to break it
in half so Sivana didn't do

851
00:40:25,205 --> 00:40:27,250
super bad-guy stuff with it,
okay?

852
00:40:27,294 --> 00:40:28,817
You broke the staff,

853
00:40:28,861 --> 00:40:30,732
meaning you broke the barrier
between worlds.

854
00:40:30,776 --> 00:40:32,038
Which we now know.

855
00:40:32,081 --> 00:40:33,996
We also now know
what they look like,

856
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,781
so when they come to hunt us,
we'll see those two

857
00:40:35,824 --> 00:40:36,869
-coming a--
-Three.

858
00:40:36,912 --> 00:40:37,913
What?

859
00:40:39,654 --> 00:40:41,482
Atlas had three daughters.

860
00:40:41,526 --> 00:40:43,876
Kalypso, Hespera,

861

just a superhero.

I'm a super listener.

865
00:40:56,671 --> 00:40:58,064
And...

866
00:40:58,107 --> 00:40:59,282
I sense...

867
00:41:00,675 --> 00:41:03,199
that you may have feelings
for Freddy.

868
00:41:03,243 --> 00:41:05,114
Just wanna know
when he's coming back.

869
00:41:06,115 --> 00:41:07,639
Don't want him to get hurt.

870
00:41:07,682 --> 00:41:10,685
Oh, well, Anne... [sighs]
I mean, we can't choose

871
00:41:10,729 --> 00:41:12,470
the people we fall for.

872
00:41:12,513 --> 00:41:14,080
What?

873
00:41:14,123 --> 00:41:15,777
I'm not talking about that.

874
00:41:15,821 --> 00:41:18,606
If he shows up now,

00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,476
is a stack
of magical parchment.

1051
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,435
You write a message
on the magical paper

1052
00:50:03,478 --> 00:50:06,438
and say the name of the god
that you would like to talk to

1053
00:50:06,481 --> 00:50:09,049
and then the paper folds
into a...

1054
00:50:09,093 --> 00:50:11,486
[gasps] Oh, my God, yes!

1055
00:50:12,835 --> 00:50:14,315
A paper bird.

1056
00:50:14,359 --> 00:50:16,013
And it flies to the god.

1057
00:50:16,056 --> 00:50:17,884
[Super Hero Eugene] Well,
that's kinda cute.

1058
00:50:17,927 --> 00:50:22,019
Hey, what about demigods? Uh,
you know, like, Wonder Woman?

1059
00:50:22,062 --> 00:50:24,282
Do you think she's accepting
bird letters right now?

1060
00:50:26,458 --> 00:50:27,633
Did the pen just shrug?

1061
00:50:29,069 --> 00:50:30,766
Hey, Steve, do I just
dictate to...

1062
00:50:31,941 --> 00:50:33,900
I do. Okay, cool, wad that up.

1063
00:50:33,943 --> 00:50:35,075
All right. [clears throat]

1064
00:50:36,424 --> 00:50:38,383
Letter...

1065
00:50:38,426 --> 00:50:42,343
Letter, writing a letter.
No, no, no!

1066
00:50:42,387 --> 00:50:43,779
I was just talking out loud.

1067
00:50:43,823 --> 00:50:45,172
That's not a part
of the letter.
Wad that up, too.

1068
00:50:46,652 --> 00:50:48,697
[superhero Darla]
Maybe if you try

1069
00:50:48,741 --> 00:50:50,830
-speaking from the heart.
-Hmm.

1070
00:50:50,873 --> 00:50:52,701
"Dear daughters of Atlas,

1071
00:50:53,833 --> 00:50:55,878
violence is not the answer."

1072
00:50:55,922 --> 00:50:57,924
[foreboding music playing]

1073
00:51:01,101 --> 00:51:03,060
[Freddy grunting]

1074
00:51:12,112 --> 00:51:13,070
-[soldier growls]
-[Freddy grunts]

1075
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:19,380
[Hespera] Child,

1076
00:51:19,424 --> 00:51:21,469
I will spare your life
if you're honest with me.

1077
00:51:21,513 --> 00:51:22,992
Honesty.

1078
00:51:23,036 --> 00:51:26,648
Yeah, wow, very, um,
ironic subject choice.

1079
00:51:27,519 --> 00:51:28,781
The other Champions...

1080
00:51:28,824 --> 00:51:31,175
are they children
like yourself?

1081
00:51:31,218 --> 00:51:33,090
What even is a child?

1082
00:51:33,133 --> 00:51:35,918
I mean, I know I shave,
like, every week-ish.

1083
00:51:35,962 --> 00:51:37,616
Yes or no?

1084
00:51:37,659 --> 00:51:39,835
No. Your answer is no
because nobody's stupid enough

1085
00:51:39,879 --> 00:51:43,404
to grant primordial god-like
powers to a bunch of kids.

1086
00:51:43,448 --> 00:51:46,929
-Give us their names.
-The names of the Champions?

1087
00:51:46,973 --> 00:51:51,151
Um, well, there's
Brett Breyer,
and, uh, Burke Breyer.

1088
00:51:51,195 --> 00:51:52,544
Are you guys taking
this stuff in?

1089
00:51:52,587 --> 00:51:54,067
Writing this down? No?

1090
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:55,286
They drive a Dodge Ram.

1091
00:51:55,329 --> 00:51:56,548
He's lying.

1092
00:51:56,591 --> 00:51:59,116
That's your superpower,
not mine.

1093
00:51:59,159 --> 00:52:00,900
And she thinks
you're a total control freak.

1094
00:52:02,031 --> 00:52:03,163
One of you.

1095
00:52:03,207 --> 00:52:04,251
Probably you.

1096
00:52:05,296 --> 00:52:07,515
-[gasps]
-Hold him.

1097
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:09,604
[soldier growls]

1098
00:52:09,648 --> 00:52:11,911
[Freddy] Don't... [grunts]
What's happening?

1099
00:52:11,954 --> 00:52:13,217
What is that?
What's she doing?

1100
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:14,783
Power of chaos.

1101
00:52:14,827 --> 00:52:17,177
It enters a man's mind
and shatters it whole.

1102
00:52:17,221 --> 00:52:19,875
Oh. [chuckles]
My mind is already trash,

1103
00:52:19,919 --> 00:52:22,182
so I'd actually like
to see you try.

1104
00:52:22,226 --> 00:52:24,402
Because nobody has the balls

1105
00:52:24,445 --> 00:52:26,578
to handle what's
inside my brain.

1106
00:52:26,621 --> 00:52:28,841
[whispering] Say their names.

1107
00:52:28,884 --> 00:52:30,625
[magical voices whispering]

1108
00:52:30,669 --> 00:52:31,757
[gasping]

1109
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,280
[screaming]

1110
00:52:35,195 --> 00:52:37,023
Say their names.

1111
00:52:37,066 --> 00:52:39,895
[magical voices] 
<i>Say their names.</i> 
<i>Say their names.</i>

1112
00:52:39,939 --> 00:52:41,767
[screaming continues]

1113
00:52:43,812 --> 00:52:46,902
Destiny's Child did it better.

1114
00:52:46,946 --> 00:52:48,295
He is stronger than he looks.

1115
00:52:48,339 --> 00:52:50,471
[Freddy screaming]

1116
00:52:50,515 --> 00:52:52,343
-Say their names.
-Stop!

1117
00:52:54,954 --> 00:52:56,085
[hesitating] Billy...

1118
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:01,047
Billy Bats...

1119
00:53:04,877 --> 00:53:06,270
Billy B...

1120
00:53:06,313 --> 00:53:07,836
Stop.

1121
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:10,491
[breathing shakily]

1122
00:53:10,535 --> 00:53:12,014
This is from the Champions.

1123
00:53:13,625 --> 00:53:15,322
"Dear daughters of Atlas,

1124
00:53:15,366 --> 00:53:17,846
violence is not the answer.

1125
00:53:17,890 --> 00:53:21,589
Oh, good first sentence.
Thanks, Darla.

1126
00:53:21,633 --> 00:53:23,330
-We'd like to make a trade.
-What?

1127
00:53:23,374 --> 00:53:24,940
We'll give up our powers

1128
00:53:24,984 --> 00:53:28,248
if you give us Freddy,
add 'unharmed.'

1129
00:53:28,292 --> 00:53:31,338
Otherwise, they're gonna
monkey's-paw you.

1130
00:53:31,382 --> 00:53:32,818
Smart, Eugene.

1131
00:53:32,861 --> 00:53:35,212
Steve, add 'unharmed'

1132
00:53:35,255 --> 00:53:37,562
then, like, 'yours, trul...'

1133
00:53:37,605 --> 00:53:40,347
No, 'Sincerely, best'.

1134
00:53:40,391 --> 00:53:43,307
Maybe just signed
'The Champions.'

1135
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:45,091
Should we proofread it?

1136
00:53:45,134 --> 00:53:47,311
Naw, Steve doesn't
make mistakes,

1137
00:53:47,354 --> 00:53:48,790
just writes what you say.

1138
00:53:48,834 --> 00:53:52,272
Great. I feel good
about this. Me, too.

1139
00:53:52,316 --> 00:53:55,232
Anyone else want a Gatorade?

1140
00:53:55,275 --> 00:53:56,494
Do we have red?"

1141
00:53:57,669 --> 00:54:00,149
What is this Gatorade?

1142
00:54:00,193 --> 00:54:02,935
-[dramatic music playing]
-[yelps]

1143
00:54:02,978 --> 00:54:04,937
-Is it a weapon?
-Sister.

1144
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:07,940
We need not torture him
any longer.
You heard the letter.

1145
00:54:07,983 --> 00:54:09,681
[grunting]

1146
00:54:09,724 --> 00:54:11,465
-Throw them in the pit.
-[Anthea] Wait.

1147
00:54:12,466 --> 00:54:14,033
They want to make a trade.

1148
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:18,298
And we will meet, sister.

1149
00:54:18,342 --> 00:54:20,039
But humans are not
to be trusted.

1150
00:54:20,082 --> 00:54:23,695
The pit is just a bad name
for a fun place, right?

1151
00:54:24,565 --> 00:54:26,437
Right? [grunts]

1152
00:54:28,047 --> 00:54:30,441
[wizard and Freddy screaming]

[both grunting]

1155
00:54:44,803 --> 00:54:46,283
Are you hurt?

1156
00:54:46,326 --> 00:54:48,850
No, just worthless.

1157
00:54:48,894 --> 00:54:51,331
-Well, you must get up.
-For what?

1158
00:54:51,375 --> 00:54:55,248
All this pretending
to be a superhero is just...

1159
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:57,250
a way for me to pretend
I'm not broken.

1160
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:59,034
Oh, feelings.

1161
00:55:00,122 --> 00:55:02,124
[rumbling]

1162
00:55:05,389 --> 00:55:07,391

[unsettling music playing]

1164
00:55:13,571 --> 00:55:16,400
-I see something moving.
-Yeah, I see it, too.

[low growling]

1168
00:55:33,155 --> 00:55:34,156
[Freddy] Oh, shit.

1169
00:55:35,201 --> 00:55:36,594
What is that?

1170
00:55:36,637 --> 00:55:37,986
Ladon.

1171
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:40,293
The guardian
of the Garden of Atlas.

1172
00:55:42,948 --> 00:55:44,950
-[Ladon growling]
-[Freddy whimpering]

1173
00:55:46,908 --> 00:55:47,909
[roars]

1174
00:55:49,998 --> 00:55:52,610
-Run.
-I can't. I can't!

1175
00:55:56,483 --> 00:55:58,485
-[roaring]
-[Freddy screams]

1176
00:56:07,494 --> 00:56:08,800
[powers trilling]

00:56:08,843 --> 00:56:10,802
[Freddy breathing shakily]

1178
00:56:10,845 --> 00:56:12,891
-[screams]
-You're okay! You're okay.

1179
00:56:12,934 --> 00:56:14,588
I don't feel okay at all.

1180
00:56:14,632 --> 00:56:17,199
That's the power
of the dragon.

1181
00:56:17,243 --> 00:56:19,419
It emanates fear
from every pore of its body.

1182
00:56:19,463 --> 00:56:21,813
Ladon's fear paralyzes
any mortal,

1183
00:56:21,856 --> 00:56:24,076
so that none can approach
the garden it protects.

1184
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:27,732
Power of axis. Very cool, very,

1185
00:56:27,775 --> 00:56:29,647
-very rare.
-[Hespera] Anthea!

1186
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:31,692
[Anthea] I must go.

1187
00:56:31,736 --> 00:56:34,652
The door back to your world
is at the center
of the labyrinth.

1188
00:56:34,695 --> 00:56:36,480
Right, left, left

1189
00:56:36,523 --> 00:56:39,091
and then follow
the right-hand wall
to the center.

1190
00:56:39,134 --> 00:56:40,875
-You'll need this.
-How did you find this?

1191
00:56:40,919 --> 00:56:42,486
You once protected me
from the bullies

1192
00:56:42,529 --> 00:56:44,618
in your world, Freddy Freeman.

1193
00:56:44,662 --> 00:56:45,924
Now I've protected you
in mine.

1194
00:56:51,059 --> 00:56:53,366
-Hero.
-[both chuckle]

1195
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:56,500
Well, to be fair, I didn't
actually need your protection.

1196
00:56:56,543 --> 00:56:58,197
I was about to rearrange
those boys'

1197
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:59,807
internal organs
when you stepped in.

1198
00:56:59,851 --> 00:57:02,462
But you didn't know that,
which does make you brave.

1199
00:57:02,506 --> 00:57:05,422
I was just brave because
I knew I had powers.

1200
00:57:05,465 --> 00:57:09,077
No, the most powerful thing
about you is you.

1201
00:57:11,079 --> 00:57:13,734
[clears throat] How lovely
for both of you.

1202
00:57:13,778 --> 00:57:16,128
Goddess, we thank you much,
but we must get--

1203
00:57:16,171 --> 00:57:18,913
You should go. My sisters
don't need you anymore.

1204
00:57:18,957 --> 00:57:20,437
All they require now
is the seed.

1205
00:57:21,481 --> 00:57:23,527
-The seed?
-Yes.

1206
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:25,442
Which remains hidden
in a place unreachable

1207
00:57:25,485 --> 00:57:27,487
by any of their kind.
Come, come, Jeff. Faster.

1208
00:57:27,531 --> 00:57:29,968
You call me Jeff?
She just said my entire name!

1209
00:57:30,011 --> 00:57:32,753
[whimsical music playing]

1210
00:57:35,756 --> 00:57:37,758
[people chattering]

1211
00:57:43,329 --> 00:57:45,157
[Shazam] Hi, God... No?

1212
00:57:48,334 --> 00:57:50,423
Yo, Low Voltage.

1213
00:57:52,251 --> 00:57:54,079
When you fixing
this dome shit, man?

1214
00:57:54,122 --> 00:57:55,559
Oh, no, no, no,
don't worry, sir.

1215
00:57:55,602 --> 00:57:56,951
[clicks tongue] I have a plan.

1216
00:57:56,995 --> 00:57:58,475
-Really?
-Uh-huh.

1217
00:57:58,518 --> 00:58:00,215
'Cause look like all you got
is a sandwich.

1218
00:58:00,259 --> 00:58:01,521
No, these sandwiches?

1219
00:58:01,565 --> 00:58:02,696
No, these sandwiches
are important.

1220
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:04,219
They're, they're
for a meeting.

1221
00:58:04,263 --> 00:58:07,527
Yeah, sure,
Colonel Cheesesteak. [scoffs]

1222
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:09,181
Colonel?

1223
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:12,053
Oh, boy, I really need a name.

1224
00:58:13,794 --> 00:58:15,187
[dramatic chord plays]

1225
00:58:16,275 --> 00:58:18,059
Quiet one, she is.

1226
00:58:18,103 --> 00:58:20,671
I find it the most effective
way to slit an enemy's throat.

1227
00:58:20,714 --> 00:58:22,281
[chuckles nervously]

1228
00:58:22,324 --> 00:58:23,804
Is that...

1229
00:58:23,848 --> 00:58:25,676
Oh, you're totally serious.
Okay.

1230
00:58:25,719 --> 00:58:27,416
Uh...

1231
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:30,289
Right, so, look, here's
the thing, um, you're upset.

1232
00:58:30,332 --> 00:58:32,117
A bunch of wizards came
and stole your powers,

1233
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,511
which totally sucks balls,
I totally get it.

1234
00:58:34,554 --> 00:58:37,470
But, I kind of feel like
you're taking this all,

1235
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:40,517
like, really personally
and, like, I don't even
know you, lady, right?

1236
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:42,997
If thieves stormed your home
in the night

1237
00:58:43,041 --> 00:58:45,173
and stole all your coin
and then fled,

1238
00:58:45,217 --> 00:58:47,524
you would naturally
give chase, would you not?

1239
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,570
And say, in this pursuit
the thieves

1240
00:58:50,614 --> 00:58:52,093
dropped the money
on the ground

1241
00:58:52,137 --> 00:58:54,661
and your neighbor picked it up
and kept it.

1242
00:58:55,836 --> 00:58:58,665
Now, imagine it is not money,

1243
00:58:58,709 --> 00:59:00,972
but the lifeblood
of your father.

1244
00:59:01,015 --> 00:59:03,061
The last breath
of your mother.

1245
00:59:03,104 --> 00:59:05,498
The power of all the gods,

1246
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:08,762
the magic of the entire realm
that was stolen.

1247
00:59:08,806 --> 00:59:11,460
And now this magic courses
through you,

1248
00:59:11,504 --> 00:59:13,332
and you have the gall

1249
00:59:13,375 --> 00:59:15,856
to believe
that you deserve it?

1250
00:59:17,815 --> 00:59:20,382
This is very personal,

1251
00:59:21,645 --> 00:59:22,602
Billy.

1252
00:59:25,518 --> 00:59:27,607
You are very menacing.

1253
00:59:27,651 --> 00:59:29,870
I just want you to know that.
Like, I really...

1254
00:59:29,914 --> 00:59:33,613
I see the presence
that you have,
and that goes a long way.

1255
00:59:33,657 --> 00:59:37,182
But today, I really wanted
to talk about compromise.

1256
00:59:37,225 --> 00:59:39,140
[both] There is no compromise.

1257
00:59:39,184 --> 00:59:41,142
I knew you were gonna
say that.

1258
00:59:41,186 --> 00:59:43,536
Wisdom of Saruman.
Don't mess with me, okay?

1259
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:46,104
Give us back Freddy,
you take down this

1260
00:59:46,147 --> 00:59:49,368
sphere-y dome-y
magic bowl thing

1261
00:59:49,411 --> 00:59:50,978
and then, you know,

1262
00:59:51,022 --> 00:59:52,632
we won't have to annihilate
you into the ground.

1263
00:59:52,676 --> 00:59:53,938
-[scoffs]
-It's a good offer.

1264
00:59:53,981 --> 00:59:55,156
I'm being serious.

1265
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,811
You play the part of a man,

1266
00:59:57,855 --> 01:00:00,292
but you do not play it well.

1267
01:00:00,335 --> 01:00:02,599
Give us the powers, child.

1268
01:00:03,338 --> 01:00:05,079
All of them.

1269
01:00:05,123 --> 01:00:06,907
You are no leader, Billy.

1270
01:00:07,908 --> 01:00:09,823
You are a lost boy

1271
01:00:09,867 --> 01:00:13,131
who likes to make-believe
that he's a warrior.

1272
01:00:13,174 --> 01:00:15,394
Okay, look. I might not have
as much experience as you

1273
01:00:15,437 --> 01:00:17,439
'cause I'm not, like,
super old like you,

1274
01:00:17,483 --> 01:00:20,704
but I think I have
a few experiences
that you don't have.

1275
01:00:20,747 --> 01:00:24,055
'Cause I've seen all of the 
<i>Fast and the Furious</i>movies,
lady.

1276
01:00:24,098 --> 01:00:25,709
And let me tell you something.

1277
01:00:25,752 --> 01:00:28,842
It's all about family!

1278
01:00:28,886 --> 01:00:30,670
[music swells]

1279
01:00:30,714 --> 01:00:33,194
-[music stops]

1280
01:00:34,282 --> 01:00:36,502
Family!

1281
01:00:36,545 --> 01:00:39,679
Guys, that was the signal.
We practiced this,
like, 12 times. Thank you.

1282
01:00:39,723 --> 01:00:41,768
Forgot all about my family,
didn't you, Goddess?

1283
01:00:43,030 --> 01:00:45,990
No, human.
You forgot about mine.

1284
01:00:47,687 --> 01:00:49,036
[screams, grunts]

1285
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:51,256

1288
01:00:56,522 --> 01:00:57,566
[man] Come on!

1289
01:00:57,610 --> 01:00:58,655
-Let's go.
-Pedro!

You're wasting my time, boy.

[Shazam grunts]

1303
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:17,081
Yeah.

1304
01:02:17,124 --> 01:02:18,386
[Shazam] Whoo!

1305
01:02:18,430 --> 01:02:20,084
She sure didn't see
that coming

1306
01:02:20,127 --> 01:02:24,044
because she didn't go
to the eye doctor. [chuckles]

1307
01:02:24,088 --> 01:02:25,829
[Shazam] Uh, Darla,
that was, 'cause...

1308
01:02:25,872 --> 01:02:28,396
-[rattling]
-A euphemism.
That was a euphemism.

1309
01:02:35,229 --> 01:02:37,275
-[Shazam] No!
-[women grunting]

1310

[Shazam groans]

1311
01:02:50,157 --> 01:02:51,506
[Hespera] We've taken the power
from two

1312
01:02:51,550 --> 01:02:53,378
in your family already.

1313
01:02:53,421 --> 01:02:55,946
And now two more must die,
and for what?

1314
01:02:55,989 --> 01:02:58,513
So you can keep
playing soldier?

[grunting]

1320
01:03:34,767 --> 01:03:37,117
My father was Atlas.

1321
01:03:37,161 --> 01:03:40,033
Titan god of stamina
and strength.

1322
01:03:42,557 --> 01:03:45,517
His magic and power
may course through you,

1323
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:48,868
but you will never
be a true god.

1324
01:03:48,912 --> 01:03:50,914
Oh, yeah? Did your dad
have superspeed?

1325
01:03:52,089 --> 01:03:53,220
[both grunt]

1326
01:03:55,266 --> 01:03:57,659

-Nope!

[both panting]

1328
01:04:02,926 --> 01:04:05,885
You okay? That was fun.
Let's go.

1329
01:04:10,281 --> 01:04:11,848
Come on. Come on, come on.

1330
01:04:14,589 --> 01:04:16,113
[Shazam] Hurry, everyone!

1331
01:04:16,156 --> 01:04:17,157
Let's go, let's go.

1332
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:28,865
What?

1333
01:04:28,908 --> 01:04:30,736
-[door closes]
-[chain locks]

1334
01:04:30,779 --> 01:04:32,172
You thought you were
just goin'

1335
01:04:32,216 --> 01:04:33,652
into some regular porta-potty,
didn't ya?

1336
01:04:33,695 --> 01:04:35,915
Which I can somehow
still smell.

1337
01:04:35,959 --> 01:04:38,048
Yeah, yeah, it really sticks
around. It's crazy, right?

1338
01:04:38,091 --> 01:04:39,266
-Yeah.
-Like, permeates

1339
01:04:39,310 --> 01:04:40,920
the air.
Doesn't matter. Anyway,

1340
01:04:40,964 --> 01:04:42,356
welcome to the Rock
of Eternity.

1341
01:04:43,183 --> 01:04:44,663
Only Champions

1342
01:04:44,706 --> 01:04:47,100
can get in here,
through any door that we want.

1343
01:04:47,144 --> 01:04:49,929
Little thing that we can do
that your sisters can't.

1344
01:04:49,973 --> 01:04:52,497
Guys, that's what I call
a total success.

1345
01:04:53,933 --> 01:04:55,935
Okay, maybe, like,
a partial total win.

1346
01:04:55,979 --> 01:04:57,850
-Told you I suck at dodgeball.
-[Shazam] Yeah,

1347
01:04:57,894 --> 01:04:59,330
you do, yeah, but you know,

1348
01:04:59,373 --> 01:05:00,722
look, Pedro, we all have
our weak spots.

1349
01:05:00,766 --> 01:05:02,072
You know what I mean?

1350
01:05:02,115 --> 01:05:03,812
And hers... [chuckles]

1351
01:05:03,856 --> 01:05:05,423
lack of strategic thinking.

1352
01:05:05,466 --> 01:05:07,381
Now for the real trade.

1353
01:05:07,425 --> 01:05:10,819
Freddy and the staff,
for your freedom.

1354
01:05:10,863 --> 01:05:12,256
[superhero Darla] And get rid
of the dome.

1355
01:05:12,299 --> 01:05:13,431
[Shazam] Oh, yeah.

1356
01:05:13,474 --> 01:05:15,650
And get rid of the dome.

1357
01:05:15,694 --> 01:05:17,261
'Cause the city
of brotherly love

1358
01:05:17,304 --> 01:05:18,523
is gettin' a little moist.

1359
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:22,875
Word choice, man.

1360
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:24,355
[Shazam] Yeah, I regretted it
as soon as it was coming out of
my mouth.

1361
01:05:24,398 --> 01:05:25,182
- [Super Hero Eugene] It's just
one of those words...

1362
01:05:25,225 --> 01:05:26,835
[Shazam] I know. I just...

1363
01:05:31,536 --> 01:05:34,147
"Dear daughters
of Asshat-Las."

1364
01:05:34,191 --> 01:05:35,932
-Burn!
-[chuckles]

1365
01:05:35,975 --> 01:05:37,237
I just came up with that.

1366
01:05:37,281 --> 01:05:38,499
Make sure you put a dash
in there, though,

1367
01:05:38,543 --> 01:05:40,458
so it's really clear. Okay.

1368
01:05:40,501 --> 01:05:42,895
[clears throat]
Man, it's so good having
Steve cover grammar

1369
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:45,158
and spelling and stuff,
it makes me sound
so much smarter.

1370
01:05:46,072 --> 01:05:47,987
[clears throat] So...

1371
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:50,033
"A brother for a sister, huh?

1372
01:05:50,076 --> 01:05:51,773
How's that feel?

1373
01:05:51,817 --> 01:05:54,646
Also, how are you
actually sisters,

1374
01:05:54,689 --> 01:05:57,431
because the age difference
is very noticeable,

1375
01:05:57,475 --> 01:06:00,739
and slightly upsetting,
I'm not gonna lie."

1376
01:06:00,782 --> 01:06:03,133
Even though I don't like you
very much,

1377
01:06:03,176 --> 01:06:05,091
I believe everyone
deserves human rights,

1378
01:06:05,135 --> 01:06:06,919
but you don't deserve
strawberry.

1379
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:09,835
You only get yellow. [gasps]

1380
01:06:12,185 --> 01:06:13,186
She's gone!

1381
01:06:14,927 --> 01:06:16,015
Wait, what?

1382
01:06:16,059 --> 01:06:18,017
[dramatic music playing]

1383
01:06:26,895 --> 01:06:28,723
I thought we brought her in
too easily.

1384
01:06:28,767 --> 01:06:30,812
She wanted to get caught.

1385
01:06:30,856 --> 01:06:34,251
I don't get it.
Where would she even go?

1386
01:06:34,294 --> 01:06:35,295
[clanking]

1387
01:06:37,210 --> 01:06:38,211
[door creaks]

1388
01:06:43,434 --> 01:06:45,871
Well, this seemed inevitable.

1389
01:06:52,399 --> 01:06:55,185
Yep. We are so lost.
Thanks, bozo.

1390
01:06:55,228 --> 01:06:58,362
We are not lost.
Who's the wizard here?

1391
01:06:58,405 --> 01:07:00,016
I don't know.

1392
01:07:00,059 --> 01:07:02,366
You don't have any spells,
no magical artifacts,

1393
01:07:02,409 --> 01:07:04,411
you know nothing about magic,
you're just...

1394
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:09,112
You're the wizard.

1395
01:07:09,155 --> 01:07:11,375
-Thank you.
-Whatever.

1396
01:07:11,418 --> 01:07:14,117
Now let's see if that
girlfriend of yours
can be trusted.

1397
01:07:18,077 --> 01:07:20,036
[tense music playing]

1398
01:07:27,260 --> 01:07:28,261
-[door unlocks]
-[Freddy gasps]

1399
01:07:29,349 --> 01:07:31,656
Get back, get back. Get back.

1400
01:07:41,796 --> 01:07:43,798
[whispering in other language]

1401
01:07:48,586 --> 01:07:49,587
[Hespera gasps]

1402
01:07:59,901 --> 01:08:01,468
[in English] Okay,
I think the coast is clear.
Let's go home.

1403
01:08:01,512 --> 01:08:05,298
One moment.
Did you not see
what she was holding?

1404
01:08:05,342 --> 01:08:07,083
It was an apple.
She wanted a snack.

1405
01:08:07,126 --> 01:08:08,432
What's the big deal?

1406
01:08:08,475 --> 01:08:11,783
The golden apple.
From the Tree of Life.

1407
01:08:11,826 --> 01:08:13,611
From the Tree of Life.

1408
01:08:13,654 --> 01:08:15,308
Oh, wait, hold up, didn't you
say that was somewhere safe?

1409
01:08:17,832 --> 01:08:20,270
-Billy!
-Billy. Gosh.

1410
01:08:20,313 --> 01:08:21,314
[wizard groans]

1411
01:08:22,968 --> 01:08:23,969
Where are you going now?

1412
01:08:28,887 --> 01:08:29,888
[inhales sharply]

1413
01:08:31,194 --> 01:08:33,848
[exhales] Nope.

1414
01:08:33,892 --> 01:08:34,893
She's not in there.

1415
01:08:35,981 --> 01:08:37,200
Nope.

1416
01:08:37,243 --> 01:08:38,940
No, no, no.
That's a hard pass.

1417
01:08:38,984 --> 01:08:40,986
-That's a hard pass.
-[Super Hero Eugene] Yo, Billy,

1418
01:08:41,029 --> 01:08:42,509
you don't gotta worry
about that one.

1419
01:08:42,553 --> 01:08:44,207
It's just a labyrinth
that doesn't go anywhere.

1420
01:08:44,250 --> 01:08:45,991
-[sniffs]
-Like an ancient Greek

1421
01:08:46,034 --> 01:08:47,079
-labyrinth?
-[Shazam] Guys...

1422
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:50,343
[sniffs] porta-potty.

1423
01:08:50,387 --> 01:08:52,128
-[sniffs]
-[Super Hero Eugene] Mmm.

1424
01:09:01,354 --> 01:09:02,442
Hespera.

1425
01:09:07,969 --> 01:09:10,450
It's over, sisters.

1426
01:09:10,494 --> 01:09:13,061
Now we can plant the seed
and restore our realm.

1427
01:09:14,628 --> 01:09:17,805
Or we plant it in their realm.

1428
01:09:17,849 --> 01:09:21,200
But that would destroy
their world.

1429
01:09:21,244 --> 01:09:23,594
Just as they destroyed ours.

1430
01:09:23,637 --> 01:09:25,813
[Hespera] You can't be serious.

1431
01:09:25,857 --> 01:09:27,685
-Yes.
-[Anthea] No.

1432
01:09:27,728 --> 01:09:29,208
No, that's not
what we agreed to.

1433
01:09:29,252 --> 01:09:30,992
[Kalypso] Anthea,
you simpering bore.

1434
01:09:31,036 --> 01:09:32,603
[Hespera] She's right,
we've spent ages

1435
01:09:32,646 --> 01:09:34,170
waiting for this moment.

1436
01:09:34,213 --> 01:09:35,562
[Anthea] We have the seed.

1437
01:09:35,606 --> 01:09:37,521
We have the staff
and its powers.

1438
01:09:37,564 --> 01:09:39,000
[Hespera]
We are not squandering it

1439
01:09:39,044 --> 01:09:40,872
for your personal
satisfaction.

1440
01:09:40,915 --> 01:09:43,918
[whispering]
No, I should go, not you.

1441
01:09:43,962 --> 01:09:45,964
Look, I know
what you're thinking.

1442
01:09:46,007 --> 01:09:48,227
The kid with the crutch
doesn't exactly
sing "sneak thief."

1443
01:09:48,271 --> 01:09:50,664
But here's the deal.
Your knees crack like crazy
when you walk.

1444
01:09:50,708 --> 01:09:52,013
-It's pathetic.
-[knees crack]

1445
01:09:52,057 --> 01:09:53,145
See?

1446
01:09:54,233 --> 01:09:55,626
Fortune be with you, Freddy.

1447
01:09:55,669 --> 01:09:57,802
Thank you.
What did you just call me?

1448
01:09:58,716 --> 01:10:01,371
Freddy. Freddy Freeman.

1449
01:10:01,414 --> 01:10:04,852
[chuckles] That's it.
You nailed it.

1450
01:10:04,896 --> 01:10:06,463
I'll see you
on the other side.

1451
01:10:07,986 --> 01:10:09,379
[Hespera] Even if we did,
the Tree of Life

1452
01:10:09,422 --> 01:10:11,163
would not thrive
in their soil.

1453
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:14,297
It would despoil, it would
disfigure into something...

1454
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:15,733
[Kalypso] Monstrous?

1455
01:10:15,776 --> 01:10:18,214
That is what humans are.

1456
01:10:18,257 --> 01:10:21,217
It is only fitting
that we bring
our monsters to their world

1457
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:23,741
and do to them
as they did to us.

1458
01:10:26,831 --> 01:10:29,050
[Anthea] We agreed
to restore balance

1459
01:10:29,094 --> 01:10:32,576
and vengeance has
great measure of weight
on those scales.

1460
01:10:32,619 --> 01:10:35,666
Anthea, humans are villains,
even to themselves.

1461
01:10:35,709 --> 01:10:37,624
-No, not all.
-All.

1462
01:10:37,668 --> 01:10:41,193
[Hespera] Sister,
I fear your rage
has gotten the better of you.

1463
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:42,412
[Kalypso] Why?

1464
01:10:42,455 --> 01:10:44,849
Humans wreak havoc
and devastation,

1465
01:10:44,892 --> 01:10:47,068
then pray to the gods
to absolve them.

1466
01:10:47,112 --> 01:10:49,419
They actually pray
for order and peace

1467
01:10:49,462 --> 01:10:52,639
when all they do
is dismantle it at every turn.

1468
01:10:52,683 --> 01:10:54,946
Anthea, I want you
to take the apple

1469
01:10:54,989 --> 01:10:57,122
and plant it in our garden.

1470
01:10:58,471 --> 01:10:59,951
[Kalypso] Of course
you turn to her.

1471
01:10:59,994 --> 01:11:01,692
Father would be ashamed
of both of you.

1472
01:11:01,735 --> 01:11:03,476
-[object clatters]
-[Freddy yelps]

1473
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:05,348
Where did that even come from?

1474
01:11:07,001 --> 01:11:08,916
-Hi!
-You favor her, Hespera,

1475
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:10,570
and see how she betrays us.

1476
01:11:14,313 --> 01:11:15,793
Deliver him
to his proper fate, sister.

1477
01:11:15,836 --> 01:11:18,012
-No!
-[Kalypso] Kill him!

1478
01:11:21,538 --> 01:11:23,235
What is that?

1479
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:25,106
[Shazam] Great question.
No idea.

1480
01:11:26,151 --> 01:11:27,761
But made you look.

1481
01:11:27,805 --> 01:11:29,023
Billy! [chuckles]

1482
01:11:30,764 --> 01:11:32,549
-Oh!
-Oh.

1483
01:11:32,592 --> 01:11:34,333
-[Freddy gasps]
-Your crutch!

1484
01:11:34,377 --> 01:11:37,336
-Oh! Shazam!
-[lightning cracks]

1485
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:38,381
-Yes!
-No!

1486
01:11:42,472 --> 01:11:44,343
So, we have a lot
to talk about.

1487
01:11:54,484 --> 01:11:56,747
Kalypso, hand me the staff.

1488
01:11:58,618 --> 01:12:00,272
You are not fit to wield it.

1489
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:01,665
More fit than you.

1490
01:12:01,708 --> 01:12:03,362
You had him in your hands,
yet did nothing.

1491
01:12:03,406 --> 01:12:06,800
Our sole purpose is
to avenge our father,

1492
01:12:06,844 --> 01:12:08,933
but everyone here
has become weak.

1493
01:12:10,021 --> 01:12:12,240
Ladon, world-eater,

1494
01:12:13,111 --> 01:12:15,592
rise from the pit!

1495
01:12:15,635 --> 01:12:17,637
[clanking]

1496
01:12:19,987 --> 01:12:21,946
[Ladon roars]

1497
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:26,080
[Shazam] Go, go, go!

1498
01:12:26,124 --> 01:12:27,386
[superhero Darla]
Captain Everypower!
Where's he going?

1499
01:12:27,430 --> 01:12:28,779
[Super Hero Eugene] What the...

1500
01:12:28,822 --> 01:12:30,520
-[superhero Mary screams]
-[Ladon roars]

1501
01:12:32,565 --> 01:12:34,350
[all screaming]

1502
01:12:36,917 --> 01:12:38,179
[roars]

1503
01:12:38,223 --> 01:12:41,052
[snoring]

1504
01:12:41,095 --> 01:12:43,097
[superheroes chattering
faintly]

1505
01:12:44,403 --> 01:12:45,361
[Rosa] Victor?

1506
01:12:46,187 --> 01:12:47,537
Victor, wake up.

1507
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:50,844
Hello. Oh, God, woman. What?

1508
01:12:50,888 --> 01:12:52,455
Dad. We gotta go!

1509
01:12:52,498 --> 01:12:54,631
-We gotta get out of here.
-We have to go right now!

1510
01:12:54,674 --> 01:12:56,937
This is funny, right?
I know what this looks like.

1511
01:12:56,981 --> 01:12:58,678
That's not true. I have
no idea what this looks like.

1512
01:12:58,722 --> 01:13:00,419
Just don't freak out.

1513
01:13:00,463 --> 01:13:01,942
[Victor and Rosa screaming]

1514
01:13:01,986 --> 01:13:03,988
[all speaking at once]

1515
01:13:05,555 --> 01:13:07,165
I said don't freak out!
Look at me, it's Billy.

1516
01:13:07,208 --> 01:13:08,862
Rosa, it's Billy, okay?
And that's Eugene,

1517
01:13:08,906 --> 01:13:10,211
-and that's Freddy...
-It's me.

1518
01:13:10,255 --> 01:13:11,517
That's Darla
and that's Mary, obvi,

1519
01:13:11,561 --> 01:13:13,084
and then Pedro,
just normal Pedro.

1520
01:13:13,127 --> 01:13:15,086
[Shazam panting]

1521
01:13:15,129 --> 01:13:16,304
Guys, this is no time
for secrets, okay?

1522
01:13:16,348 --> 01:13:18,568
We have to tell 'em the truth.

1523
01:13:18,611 --> 01:13:21,048
-[all] We're superheroes.
-I'm gay.

1524
01:13:21,092 --> 01:13:22,136
Yeah, we know, bud.

1525
01:13:23,355 --> 01:13:24,704
-You knew?
-Yeah.

1526
01:13:25,792 --> 01:13:28,012
-Yeah.
-Oh.

1527
01:13:28,055 --> 01:13:29,883
-I'm the wizard.
-Oh, this is the wizard.

1528
01:13:29,927 --> 01:13:31,450
He's a wizard who's called
"the wizard."

1529
01:13:31,494 --> 01:13:33,278
Okay, get dressed right now.
Come on, hurry up.

1530
01:13:33,321 --> 01:13:34,366
[superhero Darla]
Put on these clothes.

1531
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:35,933
This is so weird.

1532
01:13:35,976 --> 01:13:37,238
[Shazam] Yep, yep.

1533
01:13:37,282 --> 01:13:39,893
You guys are
the Philly Fiascoes?

1534
01:13:39,937 --> 01:13:43,288
Okay. This is in no way
an acknowledgement
of that stupid nickname

1535
01:13:43,331 --> 01:13:45,377
but, yes, that would be us.
Now can you pick up the pace?

1536
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:47,423
We have to go.
The dragon is here!

1537
01:13:48,162 --> 01:13:49,816
Dragon?

1538
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:51,862
-[all screaming]
-[Ladon roars]

1539
01:13:54,517 --> 01:13:55,474
[Victor whimpers]

1540
01:13:57,476 --> 01:13:59,435
[ominous music playing]

1541
01:14:00,044 --> 01:14:01,611
[roaring]

1542
01:14:26,766 --> 01:14:28,159
-[Super Hero Eugene] You okay?
-[breathing heavily]

1543
01:14:28,202 --> 01:14:29,203
Okay.

1544
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:32,076
I know this is a lot
to take in,

1545
01:14:32,119 --> 01:14:34,078
but I promise
to explain it all later.

1546
01:14:34,121 --> 01:14:35,862
[Victor] Explain what?

1547
01:14:35,906 --> 01:14:37,560
That our kids are superheroes
being hunted by Greek gods

1548
01:14:37,603 --> 01:14:39,300
that used a dragon to destroy
the house we just bought?

1549
01:14:39,344 --> 01:14:41,520
-Yeah.
-Wait, you bought the house?

1550
01:14:41,564 --> 01:14:42,869
Yeah.

1551
01:14:42,913 --> 01:14:44,871
-[rumbling]
-[superhero Freddy gasps]

1552
01:14:45,742 --> 01:14:46,743
[roars]

1553
01:14:49,876 --> 01:14:51,269
Run! Go!

1554
01:14:51,312 --> 01:14:53,314
[all screaming]

1555
01:14:55,578 --> 01:14:56,535
[roars]

1556
01:14:58,406 --> 01:15:00,931
-[both grunting]
-Oh, no.

1557
01:15:01,714 --> 01:15:03,586
[Ladon roars]

1558
01:15:03,629 --> 01:15:04,848
[Pedro] Get down.

1559
01:15:04,891 --> 01:15:06,414
[superhero Freddy]
Okay, that's it!

1560

01:15:33,180 --> 01:15:34,660
Come on, we're good.

1565
01:15:34,704 --> 01:15:36,009
We're safe right now.
Let's go. Let's go.

-No.

1574
01:16:44,861 --> 01:16:47,124
Hey. Are you okay?

1575
01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:48,821
You okay?

1576
01:16:50,344 --> 01:16:51,345
All right.

1577
01:16:53,217 --> 01:16:54,914
Now, where is this dragon?

[foreboding music playing]

01:17:22,246 --> 01:17:24,422

[creatures roaring,
screeching]

1610
01:20:54,066 --> 01:20:56,634
You know, I never thought
I'd say this about a dragon,

1611
01:20:56,677 --> 01:20:59,202
but it is the least
of our problems right now.

1612
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:03,989
Your world will not
survive this.

1613
01:21:04,033 --> 01:21:05,295
Yeah, no shit, Merlin!

1614
01:21:05,338 --> 01:21:06,383
[Anthea] He's right.

1615
01:21:07,558 --> 01:21:09,125
Anne!

1616
01:21:09,168 --> 01:21:11,736
-Are you okay? Are you hurt?
-I'm okay, I'm fine.

1617
01:21:12,955 --> 01:21:14,521
In the God Realm, this tree...

1618
01:21:15,609 --> 01:21:17,873
is a thing of beauty.

1619
01:21:17,916 --> 01:21:19,613
Of peace.

1620
01:21:19,657 --> 01:21:22,094
It was not meant
for the soil of this realm

1621
01:21:22,138 --> 01:21:24,314
and it's become monstrous
by the hand that planted it.

1622
01:21:24,357 --> 01:21:26,446
Whose side is she on, anyway?
Do you...

1623
01:21:26,490 --> 01:21:28,622
I must try to sway Hespera.

1624
01:21:28,666 --> 01:21:30,668
Only she can subdue
our sister.

1625
01:21:30,711 --> 01:21:32,757
I will give it my all,
or die trying.

1626
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:34,280
Die? No, I'm pretty sure

1627
01:21:34,324 --> 01:21:35,847
we can come up
with an alternative to dying.

1628
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:38,415
My sweet Freddy,
I'm ready if need be.

1629
01:21:38,458 --> 01:21:40,983
I've lived a long life.

1630
01:21:41,026 --> 01:21:42,549
What are you talking about,
"Lived a long life?"
We're the same age.
You're young. We're young.

1631
01:21:42,593 --> 01:21:44,595
I'm over 6,000 years old.

1632
01:21:44,638 --> 01:21:46,075
-Oh?
-[chuckles]

1633
01:21:47,598 --> 01:21:48,599
You look great.

1634
01:21:49,165 --> 01:21:50,166
Oh.

1635
01:21:55,475 --> 01:21:57,216
Suddenly seems inappropriate.

1636
01:21:57,260 --> 01:21:58,261
Yeah.

1637
01:22:06,225 --> 01:22:08,619
We can't let her die.
She called me sweet!

1638
01:22:08,662 --> 01:22:10,229
We have to figure
something out.

1639
01:22:11,491 --> 01:22:12,623
Take my powers back.

1640
01:22:12,666 --> 01:22:14,755
-No, Billy!
-No, no, no.

1641
01:22:14,799 --> 01:22:17,019
Hey, take my powers back.
You gave 'em to me, so you can
take 'em back, right?

1642
01:22:17,062 --> 01:22:19,282
I am no longer the champion.
You are!

1643
01:22:19,325 --> 01:22:20,500
You think I know
how to fix this, dude,

1644
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:22,198
but I really don't, okay?

1645
01:22:22,241 --> 01:22:24,591
I, I didn't even know
who those Greek sisters were.

1646
01:22:24,635 --> 01:22:26,202
I had to Google them.
But you know who they are,

1647
01:22:26,245 --> 01:22:27,899
which means you know
what to do.

1648
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:29,945
And you were right.

1649
01:22:29,988 --> 01:22:32,164
You picked
the wrong champion, man.

1650
01:22:32,208 --> 01:22:34,036
I mean, that's why I always
say "all or none," right?

1651
01:22:34,079 --> 01:22:36,255
Because without my family,
I'm nothing.

1652
01:22:39,432 --> 01:22:41,739
And honestly, I have no idea
what I'm doin'.

1653
01:22:41,782 --> 01:22:42,958
[wizard] No.

1654
01:22:43,001 --> 01:22:44,481
You don't have
a shred of wisdom

1655
01:22:44,524 --> 01:22:46,004
in that brain of yours.

1656
01:22:47,266 --> 01:22:49,834
But your heart is wise.

1657
01:22:49,877 --> 01:22:53,316
And it knows exactly
what must be done.

1658
01:22:53,359 --> 01:22:56,972
I spent millennia searching
for a worthy champion

1659
01:22:58,712 --> 01:23:00,627
and no one was worthy
of what I once shared

1660
01:23:00,671 --> 01:23:03,152
with my brothers and sisters.

1661
01:23:03,195 --> 01:23:04,980
But when you shared
your powers,

1662
01:23:06,372 --> 01:23:07,808
you did not hesitate.

1663
01:23:07,852 --> 01:23:10,159
For you, everyone
can be worthy

1664
01:23:10,202 --> 01:23:11,769
if given a chance.

1665
01:23:11,812 --> 01:23:15,164
Now, go fight for your family.

1666
01:23:15,207 --> 01:23:17,427
Go fight for the world.

1667
01:23:17,470 --> 01:23:19,733
I chose right
when I chose you.

1668
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:24,782
[Freddy] Billy?

1669
01:23:24,825 --> 01:23:26,653
Billy, what are we gonna do,
man?

1670
01:23:26,697 --> 01:23:29,743
Same thing we
always do, Freddy.
Save the God darn world.

1671
01:23:29,787 --> 01:23:31,484
Now, I'm gonna go
get that staff

1672
01:23:31,528 --> 01:23:33,312
and I need you to lure
these things away

1673
01:23:33,356 --> 01:23:36,098
from the stadium while I deal
with the dragon, all right?

1674
01:23:36,141 --> 01:23:37,969
Wait, wait, wait,
Billy, Billy.

1675
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:40,189
Can I just see you,
before you go?

1676
01:23:40,232 --> 01:23:42,234
Not this version.

1677
01:23:42,278 --> 01:23:44,149
You... You.

1678
01:23:44,193 --> 01:23:45,324
My Billy.

[lightning cracks]

1682
01:23:54,681 --> 01:23:57,162
Is that why the house keeps
getting struck by lightning?

1683
01:24:00,557 --> 01:24:01,558
Hey.

1684
01:24:08,695 --> 01:24:10,610
I promise after this

1685
01:24:10,654 --> 01:24:12,438
if I don't get eaten
by a dragon,

1686
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:15,789
I'm not gonna force you
to keep me.

1687
01:24:15,833 --> 01:24:18,096
-Okay?
-What?

1688
01:24:18,140 --> 01:24:19,880
I know I age out soon.

1689
01:24:21,143 --> 01:24:22,796
Billy.

1690
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:27,236
My wonderful, kind,
brave, son.

1691
01:24:27,279 --> 01:24:28,672
You will never age out
of your home.

1692
01:24:30,587 --> 01:24:31,718
Never.

1693
01:24:36,158 --> 01:24:38,290
Now, do me a favor

1694
01:24:38,334 --> 01:24:40,771
and I mean this
from the bottom of my heart,

1695
01:24:40,814 --> 01:24:43,252
go kick their ass, okay?

1696
01:24:44,557 --> 01:24:45,602
I love you, Mom.

1697
01:24:47,212 --> 01:24:48,213
Me too.

Everybody to the battle wagon!

1702
01:25:01,705 --> 01:25:03,010
The battle wagon?

1703
01:25:04,490 --> 01:25:05,970
Trying to get
into the spirit of things.

Don't you see what
you're doing to these people?

1707
01:25:26,164 --> 01:25:27,122
[Kalypso] I do.

1708
01:25:28,166 --> 01:25:29,863
And what I see is just.

1709
01:25:29,907 --> 01:25:31,256
Hespera, look at this tree.

1710
01:25:31,300 --> 01:25:33,954
It is blighted.
It is unnatural here.

1711
01:25:33,998 --> 01:25:35,869
We made a vow
to restore our realm,

1712
01:25:35,913 --> 01:25:37,523
not destroy another.

[Kalypso] A god has answered
their prayers at last.

1714
01:25:39,438 --> 01:25:41,745
They did not know their place,

1715
01:25:41,788 --> 01:25:43,312
so I am showing it to them.

1716
01:25:43,355 --> 01:25:46,967
Your fanatical tone
echoes our uncle Hades.

1717
01:25:47,011 --> 01:25:49,056
No. I'm putting an end
to this.

Hespera.

1723
01:26:08,989 --> 01:26:12,819
If your emotions rest
with the humans so, Anne,

1724
01:26:12,863 --> 01:26:15,170
then perhaps you should
be human.

1739
01:27:28,504 --> 01:27:30,245
Okay, now what? There are only
so many minotaurs

1740
01:27:30,288 --> 01:27:31,289
I can run over with this van.

1741

[gasps]

1742
01:27:35,946 --> 01:27:36,947
Hey, Steve.

1743
01:27:38,644 --> 01:27:40,167
What are monsters afraid of?

1744
01:27:43,910 --> 01:27:45,129
"The king of beasts."

1745
01:27:45,172 --> 01:27:46,304
Lions?

1746
01:27:46,348 --> 01:27:47,436
Unicorns.

1747
01:27:47,479 --> 01:27:49,525
Really? I love unicorns.

1748
01:27:49,568 --> 01:27:51,570
Yet, the unicorn
does not love you.

1749
01:27:51,614 --> 01:27:53,616
Guys, unicorns don't exist.

1750

01:28:00,231 --> 01:28:02,059
I guess maybe
it's not so crazy.

1754
01:28:02,102 --> 01:28:05,149
The unicorn is the most
fearsome creature
of its realm.

1755
01:28:05,192 --> 01:28:06,629
Ruthless and cruel,

1756
01:28:06,672 --> 01:28:07,978
not like the ponies
from your storybooks.

1757
01:28:08,021 --> 01:28:09,501
They loathe humanity.

1758
01:28:09,545 --> 01:28:11,155
Is there anything
they do like?

1759
01:28:12,591 --> 01:28:14,767
"Dark caverns. Ambrosia"?

1760
01:28:14,811 --> 01:28:16,334
Ambrosia. It's like the nectar
of the gods.

1761
01:28:16,378 --> 01:28:18,118
It's supposed to be sweet,
like honey.

1762
01:28:18,162 --> 01:28:19,381
I have an idea.

1763
01:28:19,424 --> 01:28:21,165
Go, go! Quick, quick.

1764
01:28:21,208 --> 01:28:23,863

I lost it. Freddy, I can't.

1918
01:37:34,718 --> 01:37:36,459
What is a god
without her power?

1919
01:37:36,502 --> 01:37:38,678
The most powerful thing
about you

1920
01:37:38,722 --> 01:37:39,941
is you.

1921
01:37:39,984 --> 01:37:41,203
You taught me that.

1930
01:38:10,928 --> 01:38:13,322
That must be super
disappointing as a dragon.

Assuming that you are one.

1932
01:38:17,369 --> 01:38:19,110
I mean, you fly,
and you breathe fire,

1933
01:38:19,154 --> 01:38:21,330
but you're also made of wood
which is a weird flex

1934
01:38:21,373 --> 01:38:23,636
and a serious design flaw,
if I'm being honest.

1935

what are you doing?

You're not supposed
to be in there.

1976
01:41:57,154 --> 01:42:00,375
Yeah, I am.

1977
01:42:00,418 --> 01:42:02,290
I used to think that
I couldn't do anything right,

1978
01:42:02,333 --> 01:42:04,118
that I didn't deserve
my powers,

1979

that I can do.

had a family. You know that.

about, they all left me.

2098
01:52:47,848 --> 01:52:48,892
[Freddy] Whoa.

2099
01:52:48,936 --> 01:52:50,938
[powers resonating]

2100
01:52:52,504 --> 01:52:53,505
[Anthea chuckles]

2101
01:53:13,787 --> 01:53:14,788
[chirps]

2102
01:53:16,180 --> 01:53:17,878
-[dramatic chord plays]
-[all scream]

2103
01:53:17,921 --> 01:53:18,922
It's a zombie!

2104
01:53:20,489 --> 01:53:22,317
[Shazam grunts] Guys!

2105
01:53:23,187 --> 01:53:24,580
What the hell?

2106
01:53:24,623 --> 01:53:26,538
You buried me?

2107
01:53:26,582 --> 01:53:28,976
In what, like, two minutes?

2108
01:53:29,019 --> 01:53:30,064
Oh, Billy!

2109
01:53:30,107 --> 01:53:31,761
[all whooping]

2110
01:53:31,805 --> 01:53:32,936
Hey.

2111
01:53:32,980 --> 01:53:35,286
Oh, man. I missed you guys.

2112
01:53:38,202 --> 01:53:39,813
Hi. Hey.

2113
01:53:40,683 --> 01:53:42,685
Oh, my God. Hi.

2114
01:53:42,728 --> 01:53:44,382
Why didn't anybody tell...

2115
01:53:44,426 --> 01:53:46,341
Hi. Sorry, sorry,
I didn't, uh...

2116
01:53:46,384 --> 01:53:49,387
I didn't see you there,
I was, um, I was...

2117
01:53:49,431 --> 01:53:50,562
I was dead at the time.

2118
01:53:51,607 --> 01:53:52,738
So, you, uh...

2119
01:53:53,696 --> 01:53:55,002
you got my bird letter?

2120
01:53:56,264 --> 01:53:57,613
Oh, I, uh...

2121
01:53:59,310 --> 01:54:00,659
I think you've got
something...

2122
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:03,706
On my...

2123
01:54:03,749 --> 01:54:05,186
Where... Oh.

2124
01:54:05,926 --> 01:54:06,927
What?

2125
01:54:07,841 --> 01:54:08,885
That's a spider.

2126
01:54:08,929 --> 01:54:10,452
I'm sorry, that's disgusting.

2127
01:54:10,495 --> 01:54:12,933
Also, [chuckling]
that's really embarrassing.

2128
01:54:12,976 --> 01:54:14,238
Yes, it is.

2129
01:54:14,282 --> 01:54:16,719
But it was an amazing thing
you did.

2130
01:54:16,762 --> 01:54:18,677
The sacrifice you made.

2131
01:54:18,721 --> 01:54:21,680
You brought this world
back to life.

2132
01:54:21,724 --> 01:54:23,900
Maybe this time,
gods and humans

2133
01:54:23,944 --> 01:54:25,597
can learn to live in peace.

2134
01:54:25,641 --> 01:54:26,642
Yeah.

2135
01:54:28,035 --> 01:54:29,950
Use the power of Zeus wisely.

2136
01:54:32,300 --> 01:54:33,736
Be well, Billy Batson.

2137
01:54:35,999 --> 01:54:38,741
Hey, you know, just because
your father's power

2138
01:54:38,784 --> 01:54:40,308
is surging through me,

2139
01:54:40,351 --> 01:54:42,484
that doesn't technically
make us related, you know,

2140
01:54:42,527 --> 01:54:44,007
and I'm gonna be 18

2141
01:54:44,051 --> 01:54:45,835
in, like, five months, so...
[clicks tongue]

2142
01:54:45,879 --> 01:54:48,098
Stick to saving
the world, kid.

2143
01:54:48,142 --> 01:54:50,100
Yeah, you know, like,
that's... Okay, cool.

2144
01:54:50,144 --> 01:54:51,754
See ya.

2145
01:54:51,797 --> 01:54:53,538
What's with our boys
and older women?

2146
01:54:53,582 --> 01:54:54,583
[exhales sharply]

2147
01:54:56,411 --> 01:54:58,195
Hey.

2148
01:54:58,239 --> 01:54:59,762
Who wants their powers back?

2149
01:54:59,805 --> 01:55:00,806
[Shazam chuckles]

2150
01:55:01,720 --> 01:55:03,722
We can do that, right?

2151
01:55:03,766 --> 01:55:04,854
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Okay, good.

2152
01:55:04,898 --> 01:55:06,073
Good, good, good.

2153
01:55:06,116 --> 01:55:07,901
[Victor] I'd like
our house back.

2154
01:55:07,944 --> 01:55:09,076
Can we do that?

2155
01:55:09,119 --> 01:55:10,991
[upbeat music playing]

2156
01:55:11,034 --> 01:55:12,906
-[Victor] Dinner!
-Coming.

2157
01:55:12,949 --> 01:55:15,125
Aw. Thank you for respecting
the cross-stitch.

2158
01:55:17,693 --> 01:55:18,694
[Rosa chuckles]

2159
01:55:19,782 --> 01:55:21,218
[Rosa] Anthea.

2160
01:55:21,262 --> 01:55:22,524
Have you decided what
you're gonna do

2161
01:55:22,567 --> 01:55:25,222
about that god realm of yours?

2162
01:55:25,266 --> 01:55:27,964
Well, actually I'm gonna take
some time off while it heals.

2163
01:55:28,008 --> 01:55:29,966
Spend some time
with the common folk.

2164
01:55:30,010 --> 01:55:31,533
Learn some about your world,

2165
01:55:31,576 --> 01:55:34,057
about how, maybe,
we can learn from each other.

2166
01:55:34,101 --> 01:55:35,798
Number one sign of wisdom:

2167
01:55:35,841 --> 01:55:37,669
Admitting there's always
more to learn.

2168
01:55:37,713 --> 01:55:38,975
I'm coming around to it.

2169
01:55:39,019 --> 01:55:40,237
[doorbell rings]

2170
01:55:41,021 --> 01:55:42,152
I got it.

2171
01:55:46,548 --> 01:55:47,549
Whoa.

2172
01:55:48,332 --> 01:55:49,681
Uh, guys?

2173
01:55:50,421 --> 01:55:51,466
Guys!

2174
01:55:51,509 --> 01:55:53,555
[suspenseful music playing]

2175
01:55:58,908 --> 01:55:59,953
It's the wizard.

2176
01:56:01,737 --> 01:56:03,652
-Oh, my God!
-[Rosa] No way!

2177
01:56:03,695 --> 01:56:05,349
-Yes.
-Look at this guy!

2178
01:56:05,393 --> 01:56:06,785
Look at him, he's so handsome.

2179
01:56:06,829 --> 01:56:08,178
You pimpin' now, what is this?

2180
01:56:08,222 --> 01:56:09,919
-[Billy] You look amazing.
-You look great!

2181
01:56:09,963 --> 01:56:12,052
Well, I was
in the neighborhood

2182
01:56:12,095 --> 01:56:13,749
and, um, I just wanted
to express

2183
01:56:13,792 --> 01:56:16,143
-my gratitude before I go.
-[doorbell rings, pops]

2184
01:56:16,186 --> 01:56:20,451
Sorry. Doorbell's broken.
Actually, everything's broken.

2185
01:56:20,495 --> 01:56:21,975
-[Freddy chuckles]
-Not everything.

2186
01:56:25,065 --> 01:56:26,762
You were just
in the neighborhood?

2187
01:56:26,805 --> 01:56:29,156
[chuckles] Okay,
I came for the staff.

2188
01:56:29,199 --> 01:56:31,201
Perhaps I will hold
onto it for now.

2189
01:56:31,245 --> 01:56:35,162
I also wanted to see
your faces one last time

2190
01:56:35,205 --> 01:56:36,990
before I turn into a pile
of ash.

2191
01:56:37,033 --> 01:56:38,513
-Wait, what?
-No!

2192
01:56:38,556 --> 01:56:40,602
I am making a joke.
I have an Uber waiting.

2193
01:56:40,645 --> 01:56:42,473
-And besides...
-[chuckles]

2194
01:56:42,517 --> 01:56:45,259
...I've been trapped in rocks
and prisons for far too long.

2195
01:56:45,302 --> 01:56:47,261
It's time to see your world.

2196
01:56:47,304 --> 01:56:48,958
It's been an honor,

2197
01:56:49,002 --> 01:56:51,613
a privilege,
watching you all soar.

2198
01:56:51,656 --> 01:56:53,006
You know, you're not such
a bad wizard.

2199
01:56:53,049 --> 01:56:54,442
Thank you, Jeff.

2200
01:56:54,485 --> 01:56:56,270
-[sighs] It never ends.
-[chuckles]

2201
01:56:57,706 --> 01:56:58,707
[Billy] Also,

2202
01:57:00,143 --> 01:57:01,710
what's my superhero name?

2203
01:57:04,234 --> 01:57:06,584
Your name is...

2204
01:57:07,629 --> 01:57:09,500
Shazam.

2205
01:57:09,544 --> 01:57:10,588
-Of course.
-Yeah.

2206
01:57:10,632 --> 01:57:12,677
[all agreeing]

2207
01:57:14,331 --> 01:57:16,638
I still think we can beat it.

2208
01:57:16,681 --> 01:57:18,683
[upbeat music playing]

2209
01:59:55,927 --> 01:59:57,494
My feet hurt.
How much further?

2210
01:59:57,538 --> 01:59:58,800
About ten seconds less

2211
01:59:58,843 --> 02:00:00,367
than the last time
you asked me.

2212
02:00:00,410 --> 02:00:01,977
I'm sorry, I just feel
like we could

2213
02:00:02,020 --> 02:00:03,283
have parked
a little bit closer.

2214
02:00:03,326 --> 02:00:04,501
He doesn't know we're coming,

2215
02:00:04,545 --> 02:00:06,024
and I didn't want
to spook him.

2216
02:00:06,068 --> 02:00:08,375
"Spook him."
He's a superhero, not a deer.

2217
02:00:08,418 --> 02:00:09,854
All right, let's go.

2218
02:00:09,898 --> 02:00:11,943
And then you can tell Waller
that even though

2219
02:00:11,987 --> 02:00:14,207
she thinks this guy could be
a good addition to the team,

2220
02:00:14,250 --> 02:00:15,730
we never actually met him

2221
02:00:15,773 --> 02:00:18,211
because you wore
shitty walking shoes.

2222
02:00:18,254 --> 02:00:20,125
[chuckles] Okay, first of all,
they're boots,

2223
02:00:20,169 --> 02:00:22,084
and they're not shitty,
they're new.

2224
02:00:22,127 --> 02:00:25,087
-I just haven't had a chance
to break them in yet.
-Shut up.

2225
02:00:25,130 --> 02:00:28,177
Waller said this guy
is as powerful as they come,

2226
02:00:28,221 --> 02:00:29,918
but a little immature.

2227
02:00:29,961 --> 02:00:31,136
Oh, great.

2228
02:00:32,007 --> 02:00:34,531
Whoo! [chuckles]

2229
02:00:39,319 --> 02:00:41,321
[grunting]

2230
02:00:43,453 --> 02:00:45,063
-Billy Batson.
-Yeah?

2231
02:00:45,107 --> 02:00:46,804
I mean, no.

2232
02:00:46,848 --> 02:00:48,458
I've never heard that name
in my life.

2233
02:00:48,502 --> 02:00:49,894
I don't know who
you're talking about.

2234
02:00:49,938 --> 02:00:51,461
But I'd like to meet
that person

2235
02:00:51,505 --> 02:00:53,289
'cause they sound super cool.
And funny.

2236
02:00:53,333 --> 02:00:56,205
And talented.
And ridiculously handsome,

2237
02:00:56,249 --> 02:00:57,728
but, like, in a dangerous way.

2238
02:00:57,772 --> 02:00:59,643
What the hell
are you talking about?

2239
02:00:59,687 --> 02:01:01,819
Relax. We know who you are.

2240
02:01:01,863 --> 02:01:04,039
-How?
-Don't worry about that.

2241
02:01:05,083 --> 02:01:06,128
Who are you guys?

2242
02:01:06,171 --> 02:01:07,477
Don't worry about that either.

2243
02:01:07,521 --> 02:01:09,305
Look, we've seen
what you can do.

2244
02:01:09,349 --> 02:01:11,046
And we're here
to make you an offer.

2245
02:01:11,089 --> 02:01:12,177
How would you like to join

2246
02:01:12,221 --> 02:01:13,353
-the Justice...
-Yes!

2247
02:01:13,396 --> 02:01:14,876
A thousand times yes!

2248
02:01:14,919 --> 02:01:16,791
Oh, my gosh!
I've been dreaming about this!

2249
02:01:16,834 --> 02:01:18,793
Well, I mean,
not this exactly.

2250
02:01:18,836 --> 02:01:19,881
Like, normally,
it's Wonder Woman

2251
02:01:19,924 --> 02:01:21,143
in the dream, but...

2252
02:01:21,186 --> 02:01:22,623
-Ew.
-Huh?

2253
02:01:22,666 --> 02:01:24,842
Well, that was easy.

2254
02:01:24,886 --> 02:01:26,409
Welcome
to the Justice Society.

2255
02:01:26,453 --> 02:01:28,455
Yeah! Aweso... Wait, what?

2256
02:01:28,498 --> 02:01:29,804
The Justice Society?

2257
02:01:29,847 --> 02:01:31,240
Is that different
than the Justice League?

2258
02:01:31,284 --> 02:01:32,937
Yes. The Justice Society

2259
02:01:32,981 --> 02:01:34,374
is different
than the Justice League

2260
02:01:34,417 --> 02:01:36,245
because of how words work.

2261
02:01:36,289 --> 02:01:38,203
I just want to be
in the Wonder Woman group.

2262
02:01:38,247 --> 02:01:40,467
-So, that's you guys, right?
-No.

2263
02:01:40,510 --> 02:01:42,469
Why are you so obsessed
with Wonder Woman, dude?

2264
02:01:42,512 --> 02:01:44,384
He's joking, right?

2265
02:01:44,427 --> 02:01:47,735
-No?
-Okay. I'm out.

2266
02:01:47,778 --> 02:01:49,780
I'm gonna wait here,
'cause of the shoes.

2267
02:01:49,824 --> 02:01:51,826
Can you drive by and get me?

2268
02:01:51,869 --> 02:01:54,350
[Shazam] Hey, just a little
constructive criticism.

2269
02:01:54,394 --> 02:01:55,656
It's pretty confusing
that there are

2270
02:01:55,699 --> 02:01:57,701
two separate groups
of superheroes

2271
02:01:57,745 --> 02:01:59,268
that are totally unaffiliated,

2272
02:01:59,312 --> 02:02:01,357
but both have "Justice"
in their name, you know.

2273
02:02:01,401 --> 02:02:03,446
Like, have you guys ever
thought about doing
a rebranding of sorts?

2274
02:02:03,490 --> 02:02:06,362
'Cause just a quick search
on Thesaurus.com,

2275
02:02:06,406 --> 02:02:08,233
you got so many options, man.

2276
02:02:08,277 --> 02:02:11,324
Like, "Authority Society." Eh?

2277
02:02:11,367 --> 02:02:13,064
Uh, uh, "Code Society."
That's stupid.

2278
02:02:13,108 --> 02:02:14,501
These are, like, legal terms.

2279
02:02:14,544 --> 02:02:17,678
[gasps] "The Avenger Society."

2280
02:02:17,721 --> 02:02:19,201
[inhales sharply]

2281
02:02:19,244 --> 02:02:20,681
I like that, for some reason.

2282
02:02:23,510 --> 02:02:25,512
[gentle music playing]

2283
02:02:40,831 --> 02:02:43,051
[music builds up]

2284
02:02:49,797 --> 02:02:51,799
[dramatic music playing]

2285
02:06:05,819 --> 02:06:07,821
[mysterious music playing]

2286
02:07:34,081 --> 02:07:36,083
[intense music playing]

2287
02:08:34,315 --> 02:08:36,360
[distant chattering]

2288
02:08:36,404 --> 02:08:38,406
[unsettling music playing]

2289
02:08:53,943 --> 02:08:56,163
[voice laughing]

2290
02:08:56,206 --> 02:09:00,254
[Mister Mind] Well, well,
Doctor. We meet again.

2291
02:09:00,297 --> 02:09:02,125
Where in the hell
have you been?

2292
02:09:02,169 --> 02:09:05,215
[Mister Mind] To implement
the perfect plan, Doctor,

2293
02:09:05,259 --> 02:09:07,609
one must have patience.

2294
02:09:07,652 --> 02:09:09,089
What are you talking about?

2295
02:09:10,830 --> 02:09:12,701
It's been two goddamn years!

2296
02:09:12,745 --> 02:09:17,662
Yes. But what is time
but a trick of the mind?

2297
02:09:17,706 --> 02:09:19,055
A meaningless measure.

2298
02:09:19,099 --> 02:09:21,754
Hey. I'm 57 years old.

2299
02:09:21,797 --> 02:09:25,018
I'm stuck in a concrete box
surrounded by lunatics

2300
02:09:25,061 --> 02:09:27,020
waiting for a worm to enact
some, what,

2301
02:09:27,063 --> 02:09:29,587
vague plan I've been told
absolutely nothing about?

2302
02:09:29,631 --> 02:09:32,286
It takes me a very long time
to get places, okay?

2303
02:09:32,329 --> 02:09:35,115
I do not have legs,
I do not have wings,

2304
02:09:35,158 --> 02:09:38,596
I just slither around
endlessly.

2305
02:09:38,640 --> 02:09:41,077
But not for long.

2306
02:09:41,121 --> 02:09:42,644
[laughing]

2307
02:09:43,906 --> 02:09:45,603
Tell me everything.

2308
02:09:47,127 --> 02:09:49,216
Just one more thing
I need to do.

2309
02:09:49,259 --> 02:09:51,261
What? No!

2310
02:09:52,828 --> 02:09:54,395
Oh, goddamn it!
