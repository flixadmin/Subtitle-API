00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,219
Get it together Teddy!

3
00:01:10,559 --> 00:01:12,239
Get it together!

4
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:18,439
It's just water.

5
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:22,439
It's a lot of water

6
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:29,639
Come on.

7
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:54,959
- You okay boss?
-Yeah, i'm just...i just can't

8
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:59,559
I just can not stand on water.

9
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:04,639
- You're my new partner?
- that's right.

10
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,639
Not the best way to know you
half head in the toilet.

11
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,559
Doesn't exactly square with
Teddy Daniels: the man of legend, i'll give you that

12
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:13,839
the Legend?

13
00:02:14,559 --> 00:02:16,039
What the hell are you boys smoking
out there in Portland anyway?

14
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:17,719
Seatle.

15
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:19,719
I came from the office in Seatle.

16
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,239
How long have you been with Marshals?

17
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:25,839
Four years.

18
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:29,439
So you know how small it is

19
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:35,039
What about you? got a girl? Married?

20
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,359
I was.

21
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:50,159
she died.

22
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:53,639
- Jesus ...Boss, i didn't...
- don't worry .

23
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:57,839
There was a fire in our apartment
building, while i was out

24
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,639
Four People died.

25
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:02,239
It was the smoke that got her
not the fire

26
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:05,239
- That's important.
- I'm sorry.

27
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:08,439
Where are my goddamn Cigars?

28
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:10,799
i have. have one of mine

29
00:03:10,839 --> 00:03:13,959
I could swear that I have the clothes
when I boarded.

30
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,439
Government employees, rob you blind

31
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,159
thanks

32
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:23,639
Have you received any briefing
about the institution befor you left?

33
00:03:23,679 --> 00:03:26,159
All I know is it's a mental hospital

34
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,439
For the criminally insane.

35
00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:32,359
Well, if it was just folks hearing voices

36
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:35,239
and chasing butterflies, i guess
they wouldn,t need us

37
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:47,239
- that's where we're headed?
- Yap.

38
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:49,839
The other side of the island is rock bluffs

39
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,239
all to ended in water

40
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:56,439
The dock, it's the
only way on, or off

41
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:59,439
we will casting off again as soon as
you two are ashore

42
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:02,239
i'd appreciate if you two hurry about it

43
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,639
- Why?
- Storm's coming.

44
00:04:30,359 --> 00:04:32,239
I've never seen a marshal
badge before.

45
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:36,039
i'm Deputy warden
McPherson, gentlemen.

46
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:39,439
Welcome to Shutter Island.
I'll be taking you up to Ashecliffe.

47
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:54,839
Your boys seem a little on edge
Mr McPherson

48
00:04:55,239 --> 00:04:57,439
Right now, Marshal. We all are

49
00:05:14,239 --> 00:05:17,039
"Remember us for we too have
lived, loved and laughed"

50
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,519
Electrified perimeter.

51
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:44,639
How you know?

52
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,639
I've seen something like it before.

53
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:18,839
All right. you gentelman will be accorded
all the help we can offer.

54
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:23,439
But during the stay you will
obey protocol, do you understand?

55
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,839
Absolutely.

56
00:06:25,359 --> 00:06:28,439
The red brick bulding on my right
is ward A, the male ward

57
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,159
Ward B the female ward, is one
on the left

58
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:36,239
Ward C is that building on the bluffs

59
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:38,639
The most dangerous patients
are there

60
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:42,839
Admittance to ward C is forbidden without
the written consent and

61
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:45,239
physical presence of both myself and Dr.Cawly

62
00:06:45,719 --> 00:06:47,039
Is that understood?

63
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:50,839
You act like insanity is catching

64
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:56,119
You are hereby required to surrending
your firearms

65
00:06:58,239 --> 00:07:01,439
Mr McPherson, We are duly apointed
federal marshals

66
00:07:01,559 --> 00:07:03,839
we are required to carry our
firearms at all times

67
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:06,839
Executive order 319 of the Fedral Code of
Penitentiaries states that

68
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:08,919
when stays at Penitentiaries

69
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:12,039
the office head of institutions
has the final authority.

70
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:17,439
Gentlemen, you will not be allowed
to pass through the gate with your firearms

71
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:40,159
ok, well that does for the official stuff,
come on boys

72
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,159
What do you say we go find Dr.Cawley?

73
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:56,759
So when did she escaped? the prisoner?

74
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:59,639
I'm afraid that Dr. Cawley will have to
fill you in on the situation

75
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:00,839
Protocol.

76
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:03,039
Correctional officers at a mental institution

77
00:08:03,119 --> 00:08:05,328
that's a weired sight,
if you don't mind me saying

78
00:08:05,428 --> 00:08:08,320
It's the only pursuit of it's kind in the U.S

79
00:08:07,559 --> 00:08:10,959
Even in the world. We care
only the most periculo and patients.

80
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:14,559
Most of the other hospitals can not deal.
And all because of Dr. Cawley.

81
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:17,959
It created something really unique here.
Hospital, people who deal ...

82
00:08:47,239 --> 00:08:48,839
Id's, gentlemen.

83
00:08:52,439 --> 00:08:54,039
Badges, gentlemen.

84
00:08:54,239 --> 00:08:56,359
Dr. Cawley's been consulted
numerous times

85
00:08:56,439 --> 00:09:00,484
- By Scotland Yard, MI 5, OSS ...
- Why?

86
00:09:00,484 --> 00:09:02,639
What do you mean?

87
00:09:04,319 --> 00:09:07,719
Why the intelligence agencies want
to consult a psychatrist about?

88
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,439
i guess you'll have to ask him

89
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:21,039
-  Marshall Daniels.
- I am Ted.

90
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:22,839
marshall Aule.

91
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:26,839
- Thanl you deputy warden, that will be all
- Yes, sir.

92
00:09:27,719 --> 00:09:29,159
pleasure, gentlemen.

93
00:09:30,439 --> 00:09:32,039
He sure had a lot to say about you

94
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,039
McPherson is a good man.
he believe in the work they do here.

95
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,439
And what would that be exactly?

96
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,639
a moral fusion between law and
order and clinical care

97
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,039
Pardon me Dr...
a waht between what and what?

98
00:09:50,439 --> 00:09:52,719
These paintings are quite accurate.

99
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,119
It used to be that kind of patients we
deal with here

100
00:09:56,239 --> 00:09:58,639
shackled and left in their own filth

101
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:02,199
they were beaten
as they put bloody

102
00:10:02,239 --> 00:10:07,039
drove screws into their brain, and submerged them into icy water to lose their consciousness

103
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:10,159
Or even drown.

104
00:10:10,439 --> 00:10:12,399
- And now?
- we treat them.

105
00:10:12,439 --> 00:10:14,239
Trying to heal, to cure.

106
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:18,839
And if this fails, we at least provide them
with a measure of calm in their lives.

107
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:20,839
these are ...

108
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:23,039
all violent offenders, right?

109
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,959
they've hurt people.

110
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:28,239
- murdered them in some cases.
- In almost all cases. Yes.

111
00:10:29,439 --> 00:10:32,639
then personally Doctor, I'd have to
say... screw their sense of calm.

112
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,239
It's my job to treat my patients not theire victims. I'm not here to judge.

113
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:41,039
- So this female prisoner ...
- Patient.

114
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:46,039
Excuse me, patient.
one Solando Rachel,

115
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:49,159
- Escaped sometime in the last 24 hours.
- Last night.

116
00:10:49,239 --> 00:10:51,159
Between 10 and midnight

117
00:10:51,239 --> 00:10:53,639
- Is she considered dangerous?
- You could say that.

118
00:10:54,439 --> 00:10:55,839
She killed all three of her children.

119
00:10:56,839 --> 00:10:58,639
She drowned them in the lake behind the house.

120
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,559
She took them out one by one and held their
head in water until drowned.

121
00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:06,439
Thenshe brought them back inside and
arranged them around the kitchen table

122
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:08,559
and ate a meal
before a neighbor dropped by.

123
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,159
What about her husband?

124
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:15,959
He died. On the beaches of Normandy.
she is a poor widow.

125
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:20,239
She starved herself when first she came here
she insist the children weren't dead

126
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,039
- Sorry Dr wouldn't happen to have some aspirin?
-  Prone to headaches marshal

127
00:11:35,359 --> 00:11:36,519
Sometimes, but today ...

128
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:39,839
- more prone to seasickness.
-Ah, Dehydration ...

129
00:11:40,239 --> 00:11:41,799
- You allright boss?
- Yes.

130
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,239
In that case you're quite right
Simpler the better.

131
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:46,239
thank you so much

132
00:11:46,719 --> 00:11:49,039
Rachel still believe
her children are alived.

133
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,839
Also thought that this is her home
of Berckshires.

134
00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:56,199
you are kidding.

135
00:11:56,239 --> 00:11:59,239
in four years acknowldge
that she is in an institution

136
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,559
She believe we're all ...

137
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,639
deliveryman Milkman, postal workers.

138
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:07,439
to sustain the Illusion that her children never died
she created an elaborate fictional structure

139
00:12:07,479 --> 00:12:10,239
she gives us all parts to play in that fiction

140
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:15,839
- so you searched the ground yet?
- the warden and his man scoured the island,

141
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:17,239
not a trace.

142
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:20,719
What's more disturbing, is that we don't know
how she got out of her room.

143
00:12:22,439 --> 00:12:23,839
it was locked from the outside

144
00:12:24,719 --> 00:12:26,239
and the only window is barred.

145
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,359
it's as if she evaporated straight
through the walls.

146
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,959
Brought her right back here after
group therapy, locked her in

147
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:43,839
I came back for midnight rounde
and she was gone

148
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,839
Seriously doctor, how is it possible
the truth never gets through her?

149
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:57,239
Ie, in an institution
mental illness, right?

150
00:12:57,959 --> 00:12:59,839
seems like something you'de
notice from time to time

151
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:03,039
- How many pairs of shoes get patientsi?
- Two pairs.

152
00:13:03,439 --> 00:13:05,559
Sanity is not a choice, marshal,

153
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:07,639
You can't just choode to get over it

154
00:13:08,239 --> 00:13:11,039
So ... she left here barefoot?

155
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:15,039
Come on Doc, she can't get ten
yard in this terrain.

156
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:16,968
Marshall?

157
00:13:33,838 --> 00:13:35,238
. The law of 4.
Who's 67?.

158
00:13:35,358 --> 00:13:37,358
That's definitely Rachel's
Handwriting

159
00:13:37,438 --> 00:13:41,838
I have no idea what the " law of 4" is, though
- Not a psychiatric term?

160
00:13:41,878 --> 00:13:43,038
I'm afraid not.

161
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:44,438
Who's 67?

162
00:13:45,718 --> 00:13:46,718
Fuck if I know!

163
00:13:46,838 --> 00:13:49,718
I'de have to say that's quite
close to my clinical conclusion

164
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:52,238
So you think it's just
random scribblings?

165
00:13:52,438 --> 00:13:55,958
No, not at all. Rachel is smart .
Brilliant in fact.

166
00:13:56,238 --> 00:13:58,838
- This paper that could be important.
- Excuse me Doctor, but ...

167
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:01,438
- We need to hold onto this.
- of course

168
00:14:03,558 --> 00:14:05,318
The departure had to come through here.

169
00:14:06,438 --> 00:14:09,718
After lights out, the orderlies play
card in here

170
00:14:10,318 --> 00:14:15,038
Last night there were 7 man sitting
at the base of the atairs playing stud poker

171
00:14:15,318 --> 00:14:18,238
And yet somehow, Rachel has managed
to slip by.

172
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,318
Why?

173
00:14:20,838 --> 00:14:22,318
How? She turns invisible?

174
00:14:23,318 --> 00:14:26,438
Doctor, we need access to personal files
of all medical staff

175
00:14:26,518 --> 00:14:28,238
of nurses, guards, orderlies

176
00:14:28,358 --> 00:14:31,518
- Everyone who worked here.
- we take your request under consideration.

177
00:14:31,718 --> 00:14:34,358
This is not a request, Doctor.

178
00:14:34,638 --> 00:14:37,038
This is a federal facility
and a dangerous prisoner ...

179
00:14:37,078 --> 00:14:39,238
- Patient.
- Patient ...

180
00:14:39,358 --> 00:14:43,438
- has escaped now. You can comply ...
- All I can say is that I will see what I can do.

181
00:14:43,638 --> 00:14:47,518
Doctor, we'll need to speak with the staff,
do you understand?

182
00:14:48,838 --> 00:14:51,238
I'll assemble them in the
common room after dinner.

183
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:55,518
If you have any further questions
feel free to join the dwputy warden in the search

184
00:15:08,238 --> 00:15:11,158
It's 11 miles to the nearest land
and the water is freesing

185
00:15:11,558 --> 00:15:13,838
The current was strong last night.
the tide pushing in

186
00:15:14,638 --> 00:15:17,558
She's have drowned or been crushed on
the rocks, her body would have washed back onshore.

187
00:15:22,038 --> 00:15:24,438
Those caves down ther,
have you checked them?

188
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:26,958
no way she could get there.

189
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:31,518
The base of those cliffs are covered
in poison ivy, live oak, sumac

190
00:15:31,638 --> 00:15:34,038
and a thousand plants with thorns
as big as my dick.

191
00:15:35,038 --> 00:15:37,438
You said it yourself marshall,
she's got no shoes

192
00:15:43,158 --> 00:15:45,838
All right, boys!
Let's check the other side!

193
00:15:50,718 --> 00:15:53,518
- What's that tower?
- An old lighthouse.

194
00:15:54,438 --> 00:15:56,438
the quards already searching inside it.

195
00:15:58,838 --> 00:16:02,638
- What's in there? more patients?
- sewage treatment facility.

196
00:16:03,318 --> 00:16:05,118
It will be dark soon.

197
00:16:05,638 --> 00:16:06,838
I'm calling this off for the night

198
00:16:07,318 --> 00:16:08,638
Let's go, boys!

199
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:14,918
- You were watching the land, right?
- Yes.

200
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:19,238
Can't no one get in or out of their room
in that corridor without me seeing

201
00:16:19,638 --> 00:16:20,838
All right, Rachel Solando,

202
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:24,038
who else does she had to pass
to get down here?

203
00:16:30,038 --> 00:16:31,238
Me.

204
00:16:31,638 --> 00:16:32,718
Glen Miga.

205
00:16:33,638 --> 00:16:37,438
- Sir, I saw nothing.
- And you were at your post all night?

206
00:16:37,718 --> 00:16:39,638
Yes. But I saw nothing.

207
00:16:41,438 --> 00:16:42,718
Glen.

208
00:16:44,518 --> 00:16:45,838
Glen.

209
00:16:48,438 --> 00:16:49,838
Tell me the truth.

210
00:16:54,518 --> 00:16:56,358
I'm really ... went to the bathroom.

211
00:16:56,838 --> 00:17:01,438
- What? You breached protocols? Christ ...
- I was away only one minutes.

212
00:17:02,318 --> 00:17:04,958
All right, I do not know what to expect here.
Let's back up.

213
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:07,958
Mrs. Solando was put in her room for lights out.

214
00:17:08,438 --> 00:17:10,558
Does anybody knows what did she do
before taht?

215
00:17:11,438 --> 00:17:12,638
Anyone?

216
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:15,318
come on, anyone. anyone anyone

217
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,438
she was in a group therapy session

218
00:17:20,638 --> 00:17:22,438
Did anything unusual occur?

219
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:24,638
Defines "unusual".

220
00:17:25,358 --> 00:17:27,718
- Excuse me!
- It's a mental institution, marshall,

221
00:17:28,438 --> 00:17:30,238
for criminally insane.

222
00:17:30,438 --> 00:17:32,038
"Usual", isn't a big part of our day.

223
00:17:34,238 --> 00:17:35,638
I will rephrase.

224
00:17:36,158 --> 00:17:39,238
Did anything happened last night
during and group therapy, that was more...

225
00:17:39,838 --> 00:17:42,718
- let's Say, more memorable than ...
- Normal?

226
00:17:42,838 --> 00:17:43,958
Exactly!

227
00:17:44,358 --> 00:17:46,238
No. I'm sorry.

228
00:17:46,638 --> 00:17:49,638
Did Mrs. Solando said anything
during group therapy?

229
00:17:50,718 --> 00:17:52,438
She was worried about the rain.

230
00:17:53,718 --> 00:17:55,238
And she hates the food here.

231
00:17:55,838 --> 00:17:58,838
Complained constantly.
Last night including

232
00:18:00,238 --> 00:18:03,038
So ... you were there
in the presence of a doctor?

233
00:18:03,638 --> 00:18:06,238
Dr. Sheehan led discuses.

234
00:18:07,238 --> 00:18:08,638
Dr. Sheehan?

235
00:18:09,638 --> 00:18:12,318
Yes. He was running the session.

236
00:18:13,238 --> 00:18:14,638
He's Rachels's "primary"

237
00:18:14,838 --> 00:18:17,238
The psychaiatrist who directly
oversees her care.

238
00:18:19,638 --> 00:18:21,718
We'll need to speak with Dr. Sheehan.

239
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:24,238
I'm afraid that won't be possible.

240
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:27,638
He left on the ferry in this morning
His vacation was already planned.

241
00:18:27,678 --> 00:18:29,438
He'd putting it off too long

242
00:18:29,518 --> 00:18:31,158
You're in a state of lockdown.

243
00:18:31,838 --> 00:18:34,318
A dangerous patient has escaped

244
00:18:34,358 --> 00:18:38,038
and you let her primary doctor
leave on vacation?

245
00:18:38,638 --> 00:18:40,438
Of course, he's a doctor

246
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:48,038
Do you have the phone number for
where he's gone?

247
00:18:48,638 --> 00:18:50,838
Hello? Hello?

248
00:18:52,438 --> 00:18:53,718
Hello?

249
00:18:54,158 --> 00:18:55,758
Is anyone there?

250
00:18:56,518 --> 00:18:58,758
I'm sorry sir, but it all down.
All the lines.

251
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:00,238
The storm's hitting the
mainland as a hammer.

252
00:19:00,438 --> 00:19:04,558
If you get it working come find me immediately.
the marshalls need to make an important call

253
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:06,238
Yes, sir.

254
00:19:12,238 --> 00:19:15,078
I'm afraid I have evening rounds in the wards,

255
00:19:15,118 --> 00:19:17,958
But I'll be having drinks and a cigar at
my house around 9

256
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,638
If you like to drop by

257
00:19:19,838 --> 00:19:22,438
Good, we can talk then, right?

258
00:19:24,238 --> 00:19:26,038
We have been talking, marshall.

259
00:19:42,238 --> 00:19:45,438
Gotta say, i'm thinking I went
into the wrong line of public service

260
00:19:45,478 --> 00:19:48,398
It is a little overwhelming.
it was constructed during the civil war

261
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:51,358
The same time as the military fort
houses, ward C

262
00:19:59,638 --> 00:20:02,118
This building is the original commander's quarters
It cost a fortune when uncle sam got the bill

263
00:20:02,838 --> 00:20:04,438
the commander was courtmartialed

264
00:20:04,478 --> 00:20:06,038
I can see why

265
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:08,838
Nice music. who's that? Brahms?

266
00:20:09,838 --> 00:20:10,958
No.

267
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,438
It's Mahler.

268
00:20:20,838 --> 00:20:22,238
Quite right, marshall.

269
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:25,718
Forgive me, gentlemen ...
My colleague, Dr. Jeremiah Naehring.

270
00:20:34,238 --> 00:20:37,638
Quartet for Piano and Strings
in A minor.

271
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:43,438
-Your poison, gentlemen?
- Rye, if you've got it.

272
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:45,638
Soda and ice please, thanks

273
00:20:46,518 --> 00:20:48,358
You don't indulge in alcohol?

274
00:20:48,838 --> 00:20:50,238
I am surprised.

275
00:20:51,438 --> 00:20:54,838
Isn't it common for men in your
profession to imbibe?

276
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:58,038
common enough.
and yours?

277
00:20:59,638 --> 00:21:03,038
- I'm sorry?
- your profession, doctor psychiatry ...

278
00:21:03,558 --> 00:21:06,558
I've always heared it's overrun
with booceys and drunks

279
00:21:07,238 --> 00:21:08,838
Not that i've noticed.

280
00:21:10,638 --> 00:21:12,438
what's it? Cold tea in your glass?

281
00:21:13,638 --> 00:21:14,958
Excellent marshall.

282
00:21:15,638 --> 00:21:18,038
You have outstanding defense mechanism.

283
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:20,958
You must be quite adapt at interrogation.

284
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:33,438
Men like you ... are my specialty.

285
00:21:33,838 --> 00:21:35,638
Men of violence.

286
00:21:36,038 --> 00:21:38,438
That's a hell of assumption to make...

287
00:21:38,518 --> 00:21:42,838
No assumption. Not at all. you misunderstand me,
i said you are men of violence

288
00:21:43,518 --> 00:21:47,638
I'm not accusing you of being violent man
It's quite different

289
00:21:47,718 --> 00:21:50,238
Please, please, edify us, Doc.

290
00:21:52,718 --> 00:21:54,438
You both served overseas

291
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:58,638
Not much of a stretch, Doc. for all you know,
we were both paper pushers over there

292
00:21:59,638 --> 00:22:01,638
No, you were not.

293
00:22:16,438 --> 00:22:21,238
Since the schoolyard, I would bet neither
of you has ever walked away from a physical conflict

294
00:22:22,238 --> 00:22:26,718
Not to suggest you enjoy it
but because retreat wasn't something you considered an option

295
00:22:27,438 --> 00:22:29,158
Wasn't raised to run doc

296
00:22:30,238 --> 00:22:32,838
Ah, yes... Raised

297
00:22:34,238 --> 00:22:36,438
and who raised you, marshall?

298
00:22:36,638 --> 00:22:37,638
Me?

299
00:22:39,238 --> 00:22:40,638
Wolves.

300
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:45,838
Very impressive defense mechanism.

301
00:23:43,238 --> 00:23:45,238
Do you believe in God, marshall?

302
00:23:50,838 --> 00:23:52,558
I'm quite serious

303
00:23:54,718 --> 00:23:56,238
That's rubbish.

304
00:23:58,238 --> 00:24:01,438
Have you ever seen ... a death camp, Doctor?

305
00:24:02,758 --> 00:24:05,038
I have, I was there, for the liberation of Daqhau

306
00:24:11,438 --> 00:24:14,638
Your English is very good, almost clawless

307
00:24:15,638 --> 00:24:19,558
Your English is very good.
You hit the consonants a tad hard, though

308
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:22,438
You're German?

309
00:24:23,438 --> 00:24:27,638
-Is legal immigration a crime, marshall?
- Oh I don't know doctor, you to tell us.

310
00:24:30,638 --> 00:24:35,238
Listen, we need the files of Sheehan
and on the rest of staff as well

311
00:24:35,518 --> 00:24:38,038
No such file will be released for you.
Period.

312
00:24:38,358 --> 00:24:41,438
- We gonna need those files.
- out of the question.

313
00:24:41,478 --> 00:24:44,038
bullshit, there is no question.
bullshit.

314
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:46,038
Anyway, who is in charge here? huh?

315
00:24:46,838 --> 00:24:50,518
Dr Naehring is the liaison to
our board of overseas.

316
00:24:50,638 --> 00:24:52,638
He relayed your request and it's been refused.

317
00:24:52,718 --> 00:24:55,838
Refused? They don't have the authority to refuse. And neither you, sir.

318
00:24:55,958 --> 00:24:59,438
marshall, continues your investigation
and we will do all we can to help.

319
00:24:59,558 --> 00:25:00,958
This investigation is over.

320
00:25:01,438 --> 00:25:03,238
we will file our reports
and handle it over ...

321
00:25:03,818 --> 00:25:06,138
- Hoover's boys.
- Hoover's boys, that's right.

322
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:08,338
We'll take the ferry back in the morning.

323
00:25:08,538 --> 00:25:09,738
Come on, Chuck

324
00:25:18,338 --> 00:25:19,938
Nice night.

325
00:25:25,538 --> 00:25:27,538
You're bunking in the orderlies quarter.

326
00:25:39,658 --> 00:25:42,658
Hey boss? ... we really gonna pack it in?

327
00:25:44,018 --> 00:25:45,018
Why?

328
00:25:45,938 --> 00:25:48,858
I guess, i dunno, i just...
never quit anything before.

329
00:25:50,338 --> 00:25:52,937
We haven't heared the truth once yet Chuck

330
00:25:53,817 --> 00:25:58,617
Rachel Solando did not slipped out of
a locked room barefoot without any help.

331
00:25:59,617 --> 00:26:01,457
I'm beginning to think alot of help

332
00:26:01,617 --> 00:26:04,097
Maybe Cawley sitting up in his mansion
right now,

333
00:26:04,137 --> 00:26:06,537
rethinking his whole attitudes

334
00:26:07,737 --> 00:26:10,057
- Maybe in the morning...
- You're bluffing?

335
00:26:11,457 --> 00:26:13,137
I didn't said that.

336
00:26:31,137 --> 00:26:33,137
I found a whole stock of these, Teddy.

337
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:36,337
Jesus, are you ever sober anymore?

338
00:26:37,017 --> 00:26:39,737
I killed alot of people in the war.

339
00:26:41,657 --> 00:26:43,337
Is that why you drink?

340
00:26:46,217 --> 00:26:48,017
Are you real?

341
00:26:48,537 --> 00:26:49,537
No.

342
00:26:53,817 --> 00:26:55,137
She's still here.

343
00:26:55,937 --> 00:26:56,937
Who?

344
00:26:58,137 --> 00:26:59,617
Rachel?

345
00:27:01,137 --> 00:27:02,537
she never left.

346
00:27:15,537 --> 00:27:18,457
Remember when we stayed at the cabin
by the lake ?

347
00:27:19,937 --> 00:27:21,737
we were so happy

348
00:27:23,737 --> 00:27:25,137
She's here.

349
00:27:25,337 --> 00:27:27,137
You can't leave

350
00:27:39,337 --> 00:27:41,137
I'm not gonna leave.

351
00:27:42,657 --> 00:27:44,657
I love you so much.

352
00:27:48,737 --> 00:27:51,737
- I am the bones in a box, Teddy.
- No.

353
00:27:53,537 --> 00:27:54,937
I am

354
00:27:57,937 --> 00:27:59,617
You have to wake up.

355
00:28:01,057 --> 00:28:02,937
I won't go.

356
00:28:03,537 --> 00:28:05,537
You're here.

357
00:28:06,937 --> 00:28:08,537
I'm not.

358
00:28:09,217 --> 00:28:11,457
You have to face that.

359
00:28:13,737 --> 00:28:14,937
But she is

360
00:28:17,057 --> 00:28:18,537
and so is he

361
00:28:20,737 --> 00:28:21,937
Who?

362
00:28:23,937 --> 00:28:25,657
Laeddis.

363
00:28:29,937 --> 00:28:31,337
I have to go.

364
00:28:34,857 --> 00:28:36,737
No! please... don't

365
00:28:37,217 --> 00:28:39,217
-Just a little longer.
- Oh, Teddy ...

366
00:28:39,657 --> 00:28:41,657
Let me go.

367
00:28:42,937 --> 00:28:44,337
I can not.

368
00:29:15,217 --> 00:29:16,937
Ain't gonna be no ferry in this shit

369
00:29:21,457 --> 00:29:22,537
Doctor.

370
00:29:23,137 --> 00:29:24,137
Doctor, Doctor.

371
00:29:25,217 --> 00:29:28,017
we need to interview the patients who
were in Rachel's group therapy that night

372
00:29:28,217 --> 00:29:29,937
I thought your investigation was finished?

373
00:29:30,017 --> 00:29:32,137
It's not like we can take the ferry

374
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:35,937
and was Rachel recieving any
other treatment for her illnesses?

375
00:29:37,337 --> 00:29:40,457
Do you know what the state of
mental health field in these days, gentelmen?

376
00:29:40,657 --> 00:29:42,737
No. We are not doctors.

377
00:29:42,937 --> 00:29:44,137
War.

378
00:29:44,217 --> 00:29:46,737
The old schools believes in
surgical interventions

379
00:29:47,017 --> 00:29:51,137
Psychosurgery.
The procedures are that the orbital lobotomy.

380
00:29:52,737 --> 00:29:57,457
Some say that patientsi are reasonable,
Other essential say become zombies.

381
00:29:58,017 --> 00:30:00,137
- And the new school?
- Psycho pharmacology.

382
00:30:00,337 --> 00:30:02,337
A new drug has just been approved
of autorities.

383
00:30:02,457 --> 00:30:04,057
That relaxes psychotic patients

384
00:30:04,057 --> 00:30:05,497
some would say tames then

385
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:07,617
- And which school are you in, Doc?
- I?

386
00:30:08,137 --> 00:30:11,337
I have this radical idea that if you treat a
patient with respect

387
00:30:11,377 --> 00:30:12,737
and listen to him

388
00:30:13,337 --> 00:30:15,657
Trying to understand.
you just might reach him.

389
00:30:21,457 --> 00:30:23,897
- These pacients?
- My point is.

390
00:30:23,937 --> 00:30:26,457
What should be the last resort,
becomes the first response.

391
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:28,937
Give them a pill and put them in a corner,
and it all goes away.

392
00:30:30,137 --> 00:30:32,617
Rachel Solando was a on a combination of drugs

393
00:30:32,657 --> 00:30:36,337
meant to keep her from becoming violent
and it was only intermittently effective

394
00:30:37,337 --> 00:30:41,137
The greatest obstacle to her recovery was
her refusal to face what she had done

395
00:30:42,137 --> 00:30:43,137
"was."

396
00:30:44,137 --> 00:30:48,537
Is there a reason why you refer to
your patint in the past tense,Doctor?

397
00:30:51,037 --> 00:30:52,637
Look outside, marshall.

398
00:30:53,837 --> 00:30:55,357
Why do you think?

399
00:31:01,117 --> 00:31:04,837
Next one is Peter Breen. Assaulted
his father's nurse with a brocken glass.

400
00:31:04,877 --> 00:31:07,757
Nurse survived, but
her face permaanently disfigured

401
00:31:08,437 --> 00:31:09,837
i can't wait.

402
00:31:09,957 --> 00:31:12,637
She smiles at me.
She was so sweet

403
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:17,237
But ... I could read in his eyes.
she liked to be naked.

404
00:31:17,837 --> 00:31:19,437
Liked to suck cock

405
00:31:20,557 --> 00:31:22,037
All right, Mr Breen.

406
00:31:22,717 --> 00:31:25,517
And asked me if she can have
a glass of water

407
00:31:26,157 --> 00:31:28,837
Alone in the kitchen?
like that's no big deal?

408
00:31:29,717 --> 00:31:32,837
- Why was that a big deal?
-  It was obvious.

409
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:37,357
She wanted me to pull out my thing so she
could laugh at it

410
00:31:38,717 --> 00:31:40,357
Mr Breen,

411
00:31:41,957 --> 00:31:44,157
we need to ask you some questions, okay?

412
00:31:46,637 --> 00:31:48,237
When I cut her she screamed

413
00:31:50,517 --> 00:31:51,637
But ...

414
00:31:52,237 --> 00:31:53,837
She scared me.

415
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,437
What did she expect?

416
00:31:56,237 --> 00:31:57,757
Interesting.

417
00:31:58,437 --> 00:32:01,757
But we are here to talk
Rachel Solando, OK?

418
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:03,037
Rachel Solando ...

419
00:32:03,957 --> 00:32:06,037
Did you know she had drown her own kids?

420
00:32:06,117 --> 00:32:08,037
She drowned her kids

421
00:32:08,317 --> 00:32:11,317
This is a sick fucking world
we live in. i'll tell you that ...

422
00:32:11,437 --> 00:32:12,837
They should be gassed

423
00:32:12,957 --> 00:32:16,397
all of them... the retards, killers

424
00:32:16,437 --> 00:32:19,837
the niggers, kill your own kids?
gas the bitch

425
00:32:22,837 --> 00:32:24,837
Please.. stop that?

426
00:32:26,237 --> 00:32:28,517
- A nurse?
- Please. Stop that.

427
00:32:28,637 --> 00:32:30,837
a nurse maybe. maybe she had kids.

428
00:32:32,957 --> 00:32:34,037
A husband ...

429
00:32:35,957 --> 00:32:38,357
trying to make ends meet,

430
00:32:39,437 --> 00:32:41,637
to have a normal life ...

431
00:32:42,437 --> 00:32:44,837
assisting your father................

432
00:32:44,957 --> 00:32:48,037
You tore her face off, didn't you

433
00:32:49,637 --> 00:32:53,037
Congratulations, no more normal
for her, not ever again

434
00:32:55,157 --> 00:32:57,837
Do you know what she was afraid of?

435
00:33:00,237 --> 00:33:01,197
You.

436
00:33:01,237 --> 00:33:03,557
Could you stop that, please?

437
00:33:05,117 --> 00:33:06,837
Stop that!

438
00:33:07,437 --> 00:33:09,197
Please ... stops!

439
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:11,837
- You know a patient by the name Andrew Laeddis?
- No! No!

440
00:33:14,437 --> 00:33:15,837
I want to go back.

441
00:33:32,637 --> 00:33:34,437
I'll never get out of here.

442
00:33:34,517 --> 00:33:36,237
I'm not sure I should

443
00:33:37,837 --> 00:33:39,237
Excuse me for saying it,

444
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,037
- Miss Kearns ...
- God.

445
00:33:41,517 --> 00:33:42,957
Mrs. Kearns.

446
00:33:44,437 --> 00:33:45,637
But you seem  ...

447
00:33:46,437 --> 00:33:47,717
quite normal, ...

448
00:33:48,157 --> 00:33:50,237
I mean in comparison
with the other patients here

449
00:33:50,517 --> 00:33:54,157
Well, I have my dark days
I suppose everyone does

450
00:33:55,157 --> 00:33:58,357
Differents is that most people don't kill
their husbands with an axe

451
00:34:00,557 --> 00:34:03,637
Although personally I think if a
man beats you and fuck

452
00:34:04,117 --> 00:34:07,557
half the women he sees
and no one will help you

453
00:34:08,637 --> 00:34:11,837
axing him isn't the least understandable
thing you can do

454
00:34:13,557 --> 00:34:15,037
Maybe you shouldn't get out.

455
00:34:16,557 --> 00:34:18,237
And what would i do if I did?

456
00:34:18,717 --> 00:34:22,037
I don't know the world anymore.
They say there are

457
00:34:22,157 --> 00:34:24,717
bombs that can turn whole
cities to ash

458
00:34:25,237 --> 00:34:27,517
And what do they call "television" ...

459
00:34:28,237 --> 00:34:30,717
voices and faces coming from a box

460
00:34:31,517 --> 00:34:33,717
I hear enough voices already

461
00:34:34,437 --> 00:34:36,437
What can you tell us about rachel?

462
00:34:39,437 --> 00:34:42,437
No much, she... she keep to herself

463
00:34:43,837 --> 00:34:45,637
She believes her kids were alive

464
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:51,357
She thought she was still living
in Berkshire and we were all neighbours

465
00:34:52,037 --> 00:34:55,037
- milkman, postman
- deliveryman,

466
00:34:56,357 --> 00:34:58,117
Dr Sheehan was there that night?

467
00:34:58,517 --> 00:35:00,037
Yes.

468
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:02,117
He talked about anger.

469
00:35:04,637 --> 00:35:05,637
Tell me about him ...

470
00:35:06,957 --> 00:35:08,317
What's he like?

471
00:35:08,957 --> 00:35:11,437
I think e. ..

472
00:35:13,957 --> 00:35:16,437
Ok... nice

473
00:35:16,957 --> 00:35:19,037
Not hard on the eyes
just my mother would say

474
00:35:21,717 --> 00:35:23,437
Did he ever come passing you?

475
00:35:24,437 --> 00:35:25,437
No.

476
00:35:26,437 --> 00:35:29,037
No, Dr. Sheehan is a good doctor, he wouldn't ...

477
00:35:32,637 --> 00:35:34,437
Could I have a glass of water, please?

478
00:35:34,637 --> 00:35:36,157
No problem.

479
00:35:50,237 --> 00:35:51,637
Thank you, marshall.

480
00:35:56,437 --> 00:35:58,757
I have just one more question
Mrs. Kearns.

481
00:36:03,117 --> 00:36:05,117
Did you ever meet a patient
named Andrew Laeddis?

482
00:36:08,637 --> 00:36:09,637
No.

483
00:36:11,037 --> 00:36:13,037
Never heard of him.

484
00:36:18,557 --> 00:36:20,037
She was coached

485
00:36:20,717 --> 00:36:23,237
He used the same words as
Cawley's and the nurse.

486
00:36:23,277 --> 00:36:26,357
- It's like she'd been told exactly what to say.
- Who is Andrew Laeddis?

487
00:36:30,437 --> 00:36:33,157
You asked every one of those patients
about him. Who's he?

488
00:36:38,157 --> 00:36:41,437
What the hell, boss, I'm your partner
for the God's sake!

489
00:36:41,837 --> 00:36:43,237
We just met, Chuck.

490
00:36:44,037 --> 00:36:45,997
There are the job long.

491
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:49,037
You got a duty, a career
and what i'm doing

492
00:36:49,637 --> 00:36:51,837
not exactly by the book.

493
00:36:53,117 --> 00:36:57,837
I don't give a damn about the book, boss
But I need to know what the hell is going on

494
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:05,037
When this case came over the wires,

495
00:37:06,117 --> 00:37:09,717
- I requested it. Specifically, do you understand?
- Why?

496
00:37:12,317 --> 00:37:14,037
Andrew Laeddis,

497
00:37:14,837 --> 00:37:18,957
was the maintenance man in thr apartment
building where my wife and I lived

498
00:37:20,437 --> 00:37:21,637
Okay.

499
00:37:23,237 --> 00:37:25,237
He was also a firebug.

500
00:37:27,837 --> 00:37:29,517
Andrew Laeddis lit the match,

501
00:37:32,957 --> 00:37:35,437
that caused the fire that killed my wife.

502
00:37:43,517 --> 00:37:44,957
Open the!

503
00:37:47,637 --> 00:37:49,157
What happened with Laeddis?

504
00:37:49,637 --> 00:37:52,757
got away.
Laeddis got away and disappeared.

505
00:37:53,957 --> 00:37:55,957
About a year ago I opened the
newspaper and there he is.

506
00:37:56,157 --> 00:37:57,637
He's an ugly son of a bitch.

507
00:37:58,237 --> 00:38:00,637
He had a new scar in the right temple
down to his left lip.

508
00:38:00,757 --> 00:38:03,957
Eyes different colors.
not a type of face you forget.

509
00:38:04,037 --> 00:38:06,957
He'd burned a schoolhouse. Killed 2 people.

510
00:38:07,117 --> 00:38:08,837
He said voices told him to do that.

511
00:38:08,957 --> 00:38:11,437
First he was sent to prison
and then he was transferred here.

512
00:38:11,557 --> 00:38:13,556
- Then what?
- Then, nothing.

513
00:38:13,636 --> 00:38:17,036
He vanished like he never existed
no records forever

514
00:38:17,436 --> 00:38:19,956
I'm sure he's not in ward B
that leaves ward C.

515
00:38:19,956 --> 00:38:21,116
Or he could be dead.

516
00:38:21,156 --> 00:38:25,636
So could Rachel Solando.
Lots of places to hide a body here

517
00:38:27,036 --> 00:38:29,436
only one place where
no one really knows

518
00:38:40,836 --> 00:38:44,636
the patient , Bridget Kearne,
when she sent me for water,

519
00:38:44,716 --> 00:38:47,036
she said something back to you, didn't she?

520
00:38:47,636 --> 00:38:48,636
No.

521
00:38:50,716 --> 00:38:52,036
Come on boss!

522
00:38:55,436 --> 00:38:56,836
She wrote it.

523
00:39:00,236 --> 00:39:02,636
. Run ..

524
00:39:11,636 --> 00:39:12,716
Boss!

525
00:39:13,316 --> 00:39:16,836
We must get inside. It's turning
into fucking Kansas out here...

526
00:39:16,876 --> 00:39:18,836
All right. Now.
Let's go!

527
00:39:21,636 --> 00:39:22,836
watch out!

528
00:39:25,236 --> 00:39:26,236
Jesus!

529
00:39:28,236 --> 00:39:30,236
Come on! Let's go back!

530
00:39:47,156 --> 00:39:48,436
Jesus Christ!
damn it!

531
00:39:59,756 --> 00:40:02,636
- Are you okay boss?
- Yes. that's all right.

532
00:40:09,236 --> 00:40:10,636
So ... you think Laeddis is here ...

533
00:40:11,956 --> 00:40:13,836
What are you going to do boss?

534
00:40:16,236 --> 00:40:17,836
I'm not here to kill Leaddis.

535
00:40:26,036 --> 00:40:28,436
If it were my wife
I'd kill him twice.

536
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:43,636
When we got through the gates of Dachau,
the SS guards surrendered.

537
00:40:51,636 --> 00:40:55,036
The commander tried to kill himself
before we got there ...

538
00:40:58,236 --> 00:40:59,956
but he botched it

539
00:41:00,956 --> 00:41:02,836
took him an hour to die

540
00:41:07,436 --> 00:41:11,236
When I went outside,
I saw bodies on the ground.

541
00:41:15,436 --> 00:41:17,156
too many to count

542
00:41:42,836 --> 00:41:44,516
too many to imagine.

543
00:41:47,236 --> 00:41:48,356
so yeah

544
00:41:50,836 --> 00:41:54,036
The guards surrendered, we took,
their guns, lined them up ...

545
00:42:36,956 --> 00:42:38,636
I wasn't warfair,

546
00:42:40,836 --> 00:42:42,156
it was murder.

547
00:42:46,356 --> 00:42:48,436
I'm tired of killing.

548
00:42:51,036 --> 00:42:52,636
That's not why I'm here

549
00:42:53,836 --> 00:42:55,156
So what is it all about?

550
00:42:58,036 --> 00:42:59,516
After Laeddis vanished,

551
00:43:00,956 --> 00:43:03,636
I started doing some checking
on Ashecliffe.

552
00:43:04,956 --> 00:43:09,036
lot of people knew about this place, but no
one wants to talk ...

553
00:43:09,836 --> 00:43:11,636
like they're scared of something

554
00:43:13,556 --> 00:43:16,236
you know this place is funded by
special grants

555
00:43:17,236 --> 00:43:19,836
from the house of
American activities Committee .

556
00:43:20,316 --> 00:43:25,036
Great. And how exactly are we fighting
the countries from an island in Boston Harbor?

557
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:28,956
by conducting experiments on the mind

558
00:43:30,036 --> 00:43:31,236
at least that's my guess

559
00:43:31,516 --> 00:43:33,356
And you think thats going on in here?

560
00:43:33,436 --> 00:43:35,596
As I said, nobody's talking, right?

561
00:43:35,636 --> 00:43:38,236
Until I found someone
who used to be a patient here.

562
00:43:38,356 --> 00:43:40,036
Guy's name George Noyce.

563
00:43:40,156 --> 00:43:42,636
nice college kid.
Socialist.

564
00:43:42,716 --> 00:43:45,836
He got an offer to get some money for some psych study. Guess what they were testing.

565
00:43:46,236 --> 00:43:49,356
- drug tests.
- He started seeing dragons everywhere.

566
00:43:49,436 --> 00:43:53,116
Almost beat his proffesor to death
End up appearing in Ashecliffe.

567
00:43:53,236 --> 00:43:54,836
Ward C.

568
00:43:55,156 --> 00:43:58,396
They released him after 1 year, right?
What does he do?

569
00:43:58,436 --> 00:44:03,236
Two weeks on a mainland
he walks into a bar and stabs three men to death

570
00:44:03,756 --> 00:44:06,316
His lawyer pleads insanity,
but Noyce ...

571
00:44:06,756 --> 00:44:08,316
stands up in the courtroom and

572
00:44:08,836 --> 00:44:10,556
he begs the judge,
for the electric chair,

573
00:44:10,636 --> 00:44:12,836
anywhere but not a
mental hospital.

574
00:44:13,436 --> 00:44:15,836
Judge give him life in the Dedham prison.

575
00:44:17,036 --> 00:44:19,036
- And you have you found him?
- Yes, I've found him.

576
00:44:21,036 --> 00:44:22,236
he's a mess

577
00:44:23,156 --> 00:44:25,516
But it is pretty clear from what he tells me,

578
00:44:26,836 --> 00:44:29,156
they're experimenting on people here.

579
00:44:29,716 --> 00:44:31,156
I do not know, boss.

580
00:44:32,236 --> 00:44:35,156
- I don not believe a crazy
- That's the beauty of it.

581
00:44:35,716 --> 00:44:39,436
crazy people are a perfect subject.
they talk, but nobody listened.

582
00:44:40,236 --> 00:44:41,636
I stood in Dachau.

583
00:44:41,956 --> 00:44:45,836
we saw what human beings are capable
of doing to each other, right?

584
00:44:46,716 --> 00:44:49,076
for Christ sake we fought a goddamn war

585
00:44:49,116 --> 00:44:51,436
to stop them,
and now find out it may be happening here?

586
00:44:51,476 --> 00:44:53,636
On our land?
No.

587
00:44:55,236 --> 00:44:57,036
What are you really here to do, Teddy?

588
00:44:58,116 --> 00:45:00,036
I'm here to get the proof.

589
00:45:00,556 --> 00:45:03,836
I'm gonna go back and blow
the lid off this place.

590
00:45:04,636 --> 00:45:05,836
That's it

591
00:45:06,556 --> 00:45:07,956
wait a minute.

592
00:45:09,036 --> 00:45:11,036
You started asking around about Ashecliffe.

593
00:45:11,636 --> 00:45:13,956
waiting for a chance to get out here
then suddenly they need a US marshall?

594
00:45:16,716 --> 00:45:19,436
I got lucky. a patient escaped ,
it was the perfect excuse.

595
00:45:19,476 --> 00:45:21,556
No, no, no boss.
Luck doesn't work that way.

596
00:45:22,436 --> 00:45:26,836
The world doesn't work that way.
They got electric fence around a septic facility.

597
00:45:26,956 --> 00:45:29,956
Ward C is inside a Civil War fort?

598
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:34,356
A chief of staff with ties to the SS
Funding from HUAC?

599
00:45:34,436 --> 00:45:38,236
Jesus Christ! Everything in this place
stinks  "government ops"

600
00:45:38,436 --> 00:45:40,356
-  What If they wanted you here?
- bullshit.

601
00:45:40,436 --> 00:45:42,156
- Ask questions.
- Nonsense.

602
00:45:42,236 --> 00:45:46,436
bullshit? Where is Rachel Soalndo?
Where is one shred of evidence that she even existed?

603
00:45:47,356 --> 00:45:49,676
I had to know where
that will give me any. In any case.............

604
00:45:49,716 --> 00:45:52,036
While you were looking at that neighbourhood,
they're looking at you

605
00:45:52,636 --> 00:45:55,156
All they need to do
is making a fake escape to get you here

606
00:45:55,156 --> 00:45:57,836
And now they have you.
they have us both,here, now.

607
00:46:01,756 --> 00:46:03,436
Marshall, are you here?.

608
00:46:04,116 --> 00:46:06,036
.Please signal us, this is deputy warden McPherson.

609
00:46:06,956 --> 00:46:08,036
marshall!.

610
00:46:08,116 --> 00:46:10,036
How about that? They found us.

611
00:46:10,316 --> 00:46:12,436
It's an island, boss. They'll always find us.

612
00:46:13,836 --> 00:46:15,436
. I know you are in there ...

613
00:46:16,716 --> 00:46:18,956
We get out of this fucking island.
You and me.

614
00:46:19,556 --> 00:46:20,636
Come on!

615
00:46:24,316 --> 00:46:26,236
- Come on!
- Go!

616
00:46:35,516 --> 00:46:38,436
get dry off
Dr. Cawley wants to talk to you. Now!

617
00:46:39,156 --> 00:46:42,436
And hurry up, this thing is transforming
to a goddamn hurricane!

618
00:46:47,436 --> 00:46:49,036
I dopped those suits to be cleaned.

619
00:46:49,716 --> 00:46:51,236
It should be ready by tomorrow.

620
00:46:51,636 --> 00:46:53,716
If we don't all wash away first

621
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:58,236
speaking of which, I'm afraid your smoke were
pretty much done for

622
00:46:59,036 --> 00:46:59,956
So ...

623
00:47:01,956 --> 00:47:03,836
It's our only choice, right?

624
00:47:03,956 --> 00:47:06,956
that's something really nice in prison already
that ...................

625
00:47:07,036 --> 00:47:09,556
Now that you mention it, it is just fine.

626
00:47:10,636 --> 00:47:13,636
that's why i must repeat my insistence
that all ward C patients

627
00:47:13,676 --> 00:47:15,316
be placed in manual restrains,

628
00:47:15,836 --> 00:47:19,036
If the facility floods, they'll drown
you know that

629
00:47:19,636 --> 00:47:21,636
- That would take a lot of flooding.
- We are on an island,

630
00:47:21,676 --> 00:47:23,396
in the middle of the ocean,
during a hurricane.

631
00:47:23,436 --> 00:47:25,836
A lot of flooding seems like a
distinct possibility

632
00:47:25,876 --> 00:47:28,436
It's a gamble, Steven.
say the power fails

633
00:47:28,476 --> 00:47:29,596
there's a backup generators.

634
00:47:29,636 --> 00:47:32,436
and if htat goes? The cell doors
will open

635
00:47:33,636 --> 00:47:35,436
Where are they to go?

636
00:47:36,156 --> 00:47:38,956
They can't just hop a ferry, scoot over
to the mainland over a weak havoc.

637
00:47:39,036 --> 00:47:43,036
You're right. Probably responsible
recovery right here on us..

638
00:47:43,636 --> 00:47:45,716
If they're manacled to the floor, they die

639
00:47:47,156 --> 00:47:48,356
24 human beings.

640
00:47:49,236 --> 00:47:50,996
you can't live with that, can you?

641
00:47:51,036 --> 00:47:52,796
frankly, if it were up to me

642
00:47:52,836 --> 00:47:56,156
, i'd put all 42 in ward A and B in
manual restrains as well

643
00:47:56,236 --> 00:47:57,836
Excuse me
Excuse me

644
00:47:58,236 --> 00:48:01,556
- marshall.
- I'm sorry, I have one quick question.

645
00:48:01,556 --> 00:48:02,756
Yes, I will be with you in a moment.

646
00:48:02,836 --> 00:48:05,556
When we spoke this morning about Rachel Solando's note

647
00:48:05,636 --> 00:48:07,236
the law of 4, I loved that.

648
00:48:07,436 --> 00:48:11,156
you told me you had no idea what
that second line could refer to

649
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:13,236
Who's 67?

650
00:48:13,716 --> 00:48:16,036
Yes, I'm afraid I still do not know.
None of us knows.

651
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:18,956
Nothing comes to mind.

652
00:48:21,156 --> 00:48:22,436
Nothing?

653
00:48:26,156 --> 00:48:28,636
Because I believed i just heard
you say that there are

654
00:48:28,676 --> 00:48:31,156
24 patients in ward C.

655
00:48:31,196 --> 00:48:33,596
And 42 of patients, in wards A and B

656
00:48:33,636 --> 00:48:37,516
which would mean there are
66 patients here in this facility

657
00:48:38,036 --> 00:48:39,436
That's correct, yes.

658
00:48:42,716 --> 00:48:44,956
Then it seems that
Rachel Solando was suggesting

659
00:48:45,436 --> 00:48:49,156
you have a 67th paient, doctor

660
00:48:50,156 --> 00:48:53,036
- But I'm afraid we don't.
- This Is ridiculous.

661
00:48:53,116 --> 00:48:56,156
- What are you doing here?
- We are doing our goddamn job.

662
00:48:56,636 --> 00:48:59,116
Didn't McPherson tell you the good news?

663
00:48:59,956 --> 00:49:01,636
No, what's the good news, doctor?

664
00:49:02,316 --> 00:49:04,316
Rachel has been found.

665
00:49:05,116 --> 00:49:06,636
It's here.

666
00:49:07,556 --> 00:49:09,156
Safe and sound

667
00:49:20,036 --> 00:49:21,836
There is not a mark on her.

668
00:49:25,516 --> 00:49:27,156
Who are these men?

669
00:49:30,036 --> 00:49:31,836
Why are they in my home?

670
00:49:32,036 --> 00:49:34,036
Police officers, Rachel.

671
00:49:34,436 --> 00:49:36,716
They ... have a few questions.

672
00:49:39,036 --> 00:49:40,356
Ma'am.

673
00:49:43,956 --> 00:49:45,956
There's been a sighting of a known
Communist

674
00:49:47,156 --> 00:49:50,356
subversive in this area
passing out literature

675
00:49:51,956 --> 00:49:53,236
Here?

676
00:49:55,236 --> 00:49:57,036
In this neighborhood?

677
00:49:57,116 --> 00:49:58,436
Yes, I'm afraid so.

678
00:50:00,036 --> 00:50:03,036
If you have tell us what you have done yesterday, where you were,

679
00:50:03,636 --> 00:50:05,836
it'll help us narrow  our search.

680
00:50:06,956 --> 00:50:08,236
Yes ...

681
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:11,956
Well, I ...

682
00:50:15,156 --> 00:50:16,836
I made breakfast for Jim
and the children,

683
00:50:19,236 --> 00:50:20,436
and then I ...

684
00:50:22,636 --> 00:50:25,236
I packed Jim's lunch
and he left.

685
00:50:28,156 --> 00:50:30,436
Then I sent the children off to school.

686
00:50:35,035 --> 00:50:36,355
And then ...

687
00:50:42,435 --> 00:50:45,635
I decided to take a long swim in the lake.

688
00:50:52,035 --> 00:50:53,315
I see...

689
00:50:56,955 --> 00:50:58,435
And after that?

690
00:51:06,035 --> 00:51:07,435
After that ...

691
00:51:16,435 --> 00:51:18,035
I thought of you.

692
00:51:24,035 --> 00:51:25,035
I ... I'm sorry, ma'am.

693
00:51:25,515 --> 00:51:27,835
I do not know what you talking about.

694
00:51:30,835 --> 00:51:33,835
Don't you know how lonely I've been, Jim?

695
00:51:39,235 --> 00:51:40,835
You're gone ...

696
00:51:44,355 --> 00:51:45,835
You're dead.

697
00:51:50,435 --> 00:51:52,635
I cry every night.

698
00:51:58,035 --> 00:52:00,555
How am I supposed to survive?

699
00:52:01,635 --> 00:52:02,835
God.

700
00:52:13,155 --> 00:52:15,835
Rachel ... it will be all right.

701
00:52:19,235 --> 00:52:21,035
I'm so sorry, but ...

702
00:52:22,555 --> 00:52:25,355
everything will be all right? Okay?

703
00:52:27,235 --> 00:52:28,635
I buried you

704
00:52:30,635 --> 00:52:35,355
I buried an empty basket . Your body
was nothing but blood and chunke of....,

705
00:52:35,435 --> 00:52:37,435
eaten by sharks.

706
00:52:40,835 --> 00:52:43,435
My jim is dead,
So who the fuck are you?

707
00:52:46,635 --> 00:52:48,235
who the fuck are you?

708
00:52:49,155 --> 00:52:51,635
Who are you? Who are you?

709
00:53:01,035 --> 00:53:02,635
I'm sorry about that

710
00:53:02,755 --> 00:53:05,955
I didn't wanted to interrupt, I thought
she might trll you something, but ...

711
00:53:06,035 --> 00:53:08,035
we found her down by the lighthouse,

712
00:53:08,075 --> 00:53:10,035
skipping stones.

713
00:53:10,835 --> 00:53:14,315
We have no idea how she get there.
i'm going to ask you both to go down into basement.

714
00:53:14,435 --> 00:53:17,555
We have food, water, and cots .
It's the safest place to be

715
00:53:18,435 --> 00:53:19,635
when the hurricane hits.

716
00:53:23,955 --> 00:53:25,155
are you all right?
You look pale.

717
00:53:25,955 --> 00:53:27,715
I'm fine, it's just ...

718
00:53:29,035 --> 00:53:30,835
Boss, are you okay?

719
00:53:31,715 --> 00:53:33,955
It's so goddamn bright? isn't it?

720
00:53:34,035 --> 00:53:38,155
Photo sensitivity, headaches sometime?
Marshal are you having migraine?

721
00:53:38,515 --> 00:53:39,715
Yeah, right.

722
00:53:47,435 --> 00:53:50,835
Take these, marshall. You'll sleep a couple
of hours, wake up clear as bell.

723
00:53:50,875 --> 00:53:53,195
You have a migraine.
Imagine someone sawed open your head and

724
00:53:53,235 --> 00:53:55,235
filled it with razors then shook it
as hard as they could

725
00:53:55,275 --> 00:53:56,635
Take these pills, marshall.

726
00:53:56,755 --> 00:54:00,115
- No ... not want.
- It'll stop the pain. Take pills.

727
00:54:04,955 --> 00:54:06,835
You'll need to lay down

728
00:54:28,035 --> 00:54:29,515
carefull. All right.

729
00:54:31,155 --> 00:54:33,635
Gonna be okay. Relax.

730
00:54:39,635 --> 00:54:41,835
- Who is that?
- He?

731
00:54:42,435 --> 00:54:44,235
That's the warden.

732
00:54:46,035 --> 00:54:47,715
Do not worry about him, allright?

733
00:54:54,315 --> 00:54:57,435
Looks like ex-military prick.

734
00:54:57,635 --> 00:54:59,635
You know  I can not argue with you onthat.

735
00:56:21,955 --> 00:56:23,635
You should have saved me.

736
00:56:26,155 --> 00:56:28,635
You should have saved all of us.

737
00:56:57,035 --> 00:56:58,115
Hey buddy ...

738
00:57:01,315 --> 00:57:02,755
Laeddis.

739
00:57:03,235 --> 00:57:04,435
Yes.

740
00:57:15,835 --> 00:57:17,235
Hi, buddy.

741
00:57:18,155 --> 00:57:19,835
No hard feelings, right?

742
00:57:26,435 --> 00:57:27,835
No hard feelings.

743
00:57:41,035 --> 00:57:42,835
Little something for later.

744
00:57:46,635 --> 00:57:49,355
I know how much you need it.

745
00:57:54,635 --> 00:57:56,515
clock's ticking, my friend.

746
00:57:57,355 --> 00:57:59,115
Wer're running out of time.

747
00:58:08,715 --> 00:58:10,435
give me a hand here.

748
00:58:32,235 --> 00:58:34,035
I could get in trouble.

749
00:59:00,835 --> 00:59:02,035
I'm dead?

750
00:59:04,835 --> 00:59:06,635
I'm so sorry.

751
00:59:07,435 --> 00:59:09,835
Why did not you saved me?

752
00:59:11,155 --> 00:59:14,835
I tried, I wanted to,
but by the time I got there,

753
00:59:15,035 --> 00:59:16,435
it was too late.

754
00:59:37,435 --> 00:59:38,635
See?

755
00:59:41,715 --> 00:59:43,235
It's not beautiful?

756
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:37,355
Why are you all wet, baby?

757
01:00:40,235 --> 01:00:41,635
Laeddis isn't dead.

758
01:00:43,235 --> 01:00:44,515
He isn't gone.

759
01:00:46,035 --> 01:00:47,515
He's still here.

760
01:00:49,635 --> 01:00:50,835
I know.

761
01:00:51,635 --> 01:00:53,235
We need to find him, Teddy.

762
01:00:53,955 --> 01:00:57,035
find him and you kill him dead.

763
01:01:13,155 --> 01:01:14,235
It's okay.

764
01:01:26,235 --> 01:01:27,195
. Again!.

765
01:01:27,235 --> 01:01:28,835
Generaytor is faulty

766
01:01:33,855 --> 01:01:35,335
Are you okay boss ?

767
01:01:37,655 --> 01:01:39,335
that goddamn Migraine !

768
01:01:39,535 --> 01:01:44,135
Back up generator failed.
whole places gone crazy.

769
01:01:44,935 --> 01:01:46,455
What do you want to do?

770
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:53,335
Christ!

771
01:01:53,615 --> 01:01:56,335
No, no, no!
Put it down.

772
01:01:56,455 --> 01:01:57,735
Now! Now!

773
01:02:07,815 --> 01:02:10,455
You think the whole electrical system is fried?

774
01:02:10,455 --> 01:02:12,935
I think that is a good possibility.

775
01:02:13,455 --> 01:02:15,335
All electronic security system ...

776
01:02:15,375 --> 01:02:18,055
fences, gates, doors

777
01:02:18,135 --> 01:02:19,215
Come on.

778
01:02:19,215 --> 01:02:21,535
Nice day for a stroll
don't you think?

779
01:02:21,575 --> 01:02:23,455
to ward C for example.

780
01:02:26,535 --> 01:02:28,535
Maybe you'll find Andrew Leaddis

781
01:02:33,455 --> 01:02:36,135
The guy I told you about, George Noyce?

782
01:02:36,215 --> 01:02:38,935
He told me this is where they keep
the worse ones

783
01:02:38,975 --> 01:02:41,015
The guys in the other wards
are scared of

784
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:45,655
Noyce did not say anything about the lab?

785
01:02:45,655 --> 01:02:46,855
Not really.

786
01:02:46,935 --> 01:02:50,654
All that he remember was people
scream day and night. There were no windows.

787
01:02:50,654 --> 01:02:51,934
There were bars everywhere.

788
01:03:12,534 --> 01:03:14,054
Jesus Christ!.

789
01:03:14,734 --> 01:03:17,654
first time
on ward C, right?

790
01:03:17,654 --> 01:03:19,214
- Yes, yes ...
- Yes.

791
01:03:19,334 --> 01:03:23,334
- yeah heard stories, but ...
-  Trust me,sons. You haven't heard shit.

792
01:03:23,374 --> 01:03:25,734
we got most of the bugsies locked down now,

793
01:03:25,774 --> 01:03:27,694
But some of them are still loose.

794
01:03:27,734 --> 01:03:30,334
If you see some don't try
