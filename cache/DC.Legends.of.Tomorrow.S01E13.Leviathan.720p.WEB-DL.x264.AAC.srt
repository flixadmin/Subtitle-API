00:00:01,402 --> 00:00:04,902
<i>in 2166, an immortal tyrant
named Vandal Savage</i>

3
00:00:04,905 --> 00:00:07,005
<i>conquered the world
and murdered my wife and child.</i>

4
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:09,975
<i>I have assembled an elite team
to hunt him throughout time</i>

5
00:00:09,977 --> 00:00:11,577
<i>and stop his rise to power.</i>

6
00:00:11,579 --> 00:00:13,946
<i>Unfortunately, my plan
is opposed by the body</i>

7
00:00:13,948 --> 00:00:17,016
<i>I’d sworn my allegiance to,
the Time Masters.</i>

8
00:00:17,018 --> 00:00:19,451
<i>In the future, my friends
may not be heroes,</i>

9
00:00:19,453 --> 00:00:21,387
<i>but if we succeed,</i>

10
00:00:21,389 --> 00:00:24,757
<i>they will be remembered
as legends.</i>

11
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:30,429
<i>Previously
on "Legends of Tomorrow"...</i>

12
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:32,064
<i>The flashes
I've been having...</i>

13
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:33,732
<i>They're of Carter.</i>

14
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:35,334
It must be really weird

15
00:00:35,336 --> 00:00:37,002
feeling like you're
cheating on me with him.

16
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:38,404
No, Ray,

17
00:00:38,406 --> 00:00:40,939
I feel like I'm cheating on him

18
00:00:40,941 --> 00:00:43,542
with you.

19
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:45,944
We need to move swiftly
to locate Vandal Savage.

20
00:00:45,946 --> 00:00:50,416
There is one place in time
that we know Savage to be.

21
00:00:50,418 --> 00:00:51,984
2166.

22
00:00:51,986 --> 00:00:54,753
We have, quite literally,
run out of time.

23
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:04,797
Oh!
We're gonna need to find

24
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,765
a safe place to set down,
Gideon.

25
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:09,001
<i>I don't believe there are
any safe places, Captain.</i>

26
00:01:09,003 --> 00:01:10,869
Are we over London yet?

27
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:13,539
- What's left of it.
- Why's London shooting at us?

28
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:15,674
It's Savage's forces
that are doing the shooting.

29
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:18,477
Here in 2166, they've subjugated
most of the globe.

30
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:24,850
Maybe picking up here
wasn't the brightest idea.

31
00:01:24,852 --> 00:01:26,652
Unfortunately,
we no longer have the luxury

32
00:01:26,654 --> 00:01:28,821
of blindly searching
for Savage throughout history.

33
00:01:28,823 --> 00:01:30,722
Indeed;
We have to target Savage

34
00:01:30,724 --> 00:01:33,592
at the time and place that we're
certain he will be, which is...

35
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:36,695
Right before
he wastes your family.

36
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:38,030
What?

37
00:01:38,032 --> 00:01:40,566
Yes, Mr. Rory,
Savage will kill my wife and son

38
00:01:40,568 --> 00:01:44,036
in three days' time, but we can
save them and the world

39
00:01:44,038 --> 00:01:46,071
by stopping Savage now.

40
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,412
Captain, I've managed to slip
<i>beneath their artillery fire.</i>

41
00:01:53,414 --> 00:01:55,614
Set us down on the outskirts
of the city, Gideon,

42
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:58,550
near the encampment of the
remaining resistance forces.

43
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:00,552
We are going to need
to proceed swiftly.

44
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:01,920
I realize your family
is in jeopardy,

45
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:03,388
but perhaps some deliberation...

46
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,657
We really don't have the time,
Martin.

47
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:07,126
According to Gideon,
Savage is going to be

48
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:10,162
out in the open tonight...
Vulnerable.

49
00:02:10,164 --> 00:02:12,498
Now, in order to capture him,

50
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,832
I require the services of...

51
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:15,934
A killer, klepto, and pyro?

52
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,803
Bingo.

53
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:22,174
Here we stand
at the edge of history.

54
00:02:22,176 --> 00:02:24,109
But as tempting as it might be

55
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:27,980
to celebrate
our previous victories,

56
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:31,183
it is only for the next
and final battle

57
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:33,485
that you will be remembered.

58
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,521
There's no way
we can grab him here.

59
00:02:35,523 --> 00:02:37,656
Not with an army
standing between us.

60
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:40,526
Shh, I'm trying
to listen to this guy.

61
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,028
He gives a hell of a speech.

62
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,531
Onward to victory!

63
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:50,135
Onward to immortality!

64
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:55,507
Present arms!

65
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:56,708
Quick time. Move!

66
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,610
<i>All set on our end.</i>

67
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:01,213
Jax is in the jumpship,
ready to extract you guys.

68
00:03:01,215 --> 00:03:03,982
Especially if...
And by if, I mean when...

69
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:05,951
This thing goes south.

70
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,961
Savage's lady friend
just made us.

71
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:17,629
Have faith, Mr. Snart.

72
00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:27,105
Gideon, push in on the woman.

73
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,811
That bracelet she's wearing...

74
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:34,713
Can you get a clearer image?

75
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,556
Oh, my god.

76
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:51,630
If we don't move real soon,
we could get ourselves killed.

77
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:53,632
How about we play this
like Chicago?

78
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:54,700
Could work.

79
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:57,936
Ugh!

80
00:03:57,938 --> 00:04:00,205
What the hell
did you do that for?

81
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:08,747
We'll take Savage.
You tie up the guards.

82
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,978
Sara,
the woman you're fighting...

83
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,747
<i>You need to take her bracelet.</i>

84
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,150
Are you seriously
jewelry shopping right now?

85
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:51,923
We're outnumbered.

86
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:53,258
Fall back!

87
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:57,596
Mr. Jackson,

88
00:04:57,598 --> 00:04:59,598
now would be a good time
to pick us up.

89
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:17,683
What exactly do you think
you were doing back there?

90
00:05:17,685 --> 00:05:19,818
Distracting Savage's pals,

91
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,253
which worked, by the way.

92
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:22,654
Yes, well,
I could've been killed.

93
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,189
Never said
it worked perfectly.

94
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:25,657
At least it wasn't
a complete bust.

95
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,894
We found out
about Kendra's bracelet.

96
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:30,228
What bracelet?

97
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:35,167
My bracelet... I was wearing it
the night of my first death.

98
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:36,968
That's great.

99
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,304
Not the death part.
That's terrible.

100
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:40,739
But you told us
that objects

101
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:41,941
present on the night
of your death

102
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:43,642
can be used to kill Savage.

103
00:05:43,644 --> 00:05:45,110
You're my fiancé.
I listen to you.

104
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:46,611
And that's sweet,

105
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:48,347
but there's still
one small problem.

106
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:51,249
It's a bracelet; How are you
supposed to kill Savage with it?

107
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:53,618
A question we will answer
the moment we have obtained it.

108
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,287
We need our resident
kleptomaniacs

109
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:56,888
to steal that bracelet.

110
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,957
<i>Captain,
I've detected movement</i>

111
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:02,160
<i>300 meters southwest
of our position and closing.</i>

112
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:03,862
- Savage's army?
<i>- Negative.</i>

113
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,124
<i>I believe they are
all that remains</i>

114
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:06,698
<i>of the resistance forces.</i>

115
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm going to make contact
with them.

116
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:09,801
They might have
information on Savage

117
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:11,336
that we can use
to our advantage.

118
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:14,373
In the meantime, Ms. Lance,
get Ms. Saunders ready.

119
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,141
Ray.

120
00:06:16,143 --> 00:06:17,743
How am I supposed
to teach someone to fight

121
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:18,810
with a piece of jewelry?

122
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:19,945
Good question.

123
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:21,713
It wasn't rhetorical.

124
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:28,754
Thank you, gentlemen,

125
00:06:28,756 --> 00:06:30,756
for accompanying me
on this excursion.

126
00:06:30,758 --> 00:06:32,357
Oh, no problem.

127
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:33,892
I just love hiking
through the woods

128
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,227
in the middle
of World War III.

129
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:36,294
What if,
instead of encountering

130
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:37,829
these resistance fighters,

131
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:40,165
we meet up with more
of Savage's forces?

132
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:41,733
Why else do you think
I brought along

133
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,301
Firestorm and the Atom?

134
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:48,774
Give me one good reason
why we shouldn't

135
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:50,175
blow you straight to hell.

136
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:53,278
Better yet, give her
several good reasons.

137
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,215
My wife and son
live in whitechapel.

138
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:59,851
- It was hit hard.
- I know.

139
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:03,722
The same fate will befall you
if you don't accept our help.

140
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:05,724
How do we know
you're not with Savage?

141
00:07:05,726 --> 00:07:08,226
Because if we were,
you'd be dead right now.

142
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:11,062
Look, feel free to shoot us,
but from the looks of it,

143
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:13,498
you could use all the allies
you can get.

144
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:20,372
Whitechapel fell 11 days ago.

145
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:22,374
We have a lot of refugees.

146
00:07:22,376 --> 00:07:24,810
You think your wife and son
are among them?

147
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:27,712
Sadly, I'm confident
that they're not.

148
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:30,715
Still, we would like to help
in whatever way we can.

149
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:32,751
Very well;
Get yourselves acclimated,

150
00:07:32,753 --> 00:07:34,152
and I'll rejoin you shortly.

151
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:43,995
Hey.

152
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:56,007
Uh, I would've brought more,
but...

153
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,079
Jefferson.

154
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:02,481
Jefferson, let's...

155
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:04,282
Let's return to the ship,

156
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:07,919
and we'll bring back
those additional provisions.

157
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:09,488
Don't worry.

158
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:13,024
There's plenty more
where that came from.

159
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:14,392
We'll be back.

160
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,997
So what did you mean
back there,

161
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,131
about your family?

162
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:21,766
I'd rather not discuss it.

163
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:23,768
Yeah, I picked up on that.

164
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,871
I also picked up on the fact
that we're in London

165
00:08:25,873 --> 00:08:29,107
just a few days before Savage
tries to kill your wife and son,

166
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:32,277
and you're not trying
to get them to safety.

167
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,015
After my first attempt
on Savage in ancient Egypt,

168
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:41,286
my very next stop
was here in 2166.

169
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:43,388
I found Miranda and Jonas
exactly where I'd left them,

170
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,825
and we... we raced
towards the Waverider,

171
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:54,199
but we had a run-in
with Savage's shocktroopers.

172
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,401
Miranda and Jonas
were cut down.

173
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:04,876
So I jumped even further back,

174
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:08,647
and the outcome
was exactly the same.

175
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:14,119
I watched my family die
countless times

176
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:16,421
at the hands of Savage
and his forces

177
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:20,825
before I realized that...

178
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:22,961
Time wants to happen.

179
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:28,233
Funny feeling knowing
that the universe itself

180
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:32,203
doesn't want you
to save your family.

181
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:34,205
All right,
what are you all playing at?

182
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,840
I retina-scanned
the four of you.

183
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:37,208
There's no record of you
anywhere,

184
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,278
and you and your friends
disappeared 150 years ago.

185
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,047
Believe me when I tell you

186
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:43,214
it would take
about that much time

187
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:44,316
for us to tell the whole story.

188
00:09:44,318 --> 00:09:46,084
But the most important thing

189
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,953
is that we get as close
to Vandal Savage as possible.

190
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:50,455
No one gets close to Savage,
especially not now.

191
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:53,558
Some idiots made an attempt
on his life earlier tonight.

192
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,360
He's gone to ground
in the citadel's bunker

193
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:57,228
and he's holed up
good and tight.

194
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,464
<i>Delta camp is under attack.
Taking heavy fire.</i>

195
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:00,932
<i>We need air support.</i>

196
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,400
Where's delta camp?

197
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:07,405
Establish a perimeter!

198
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:11,076
Once it's secure,
we'll search for survivors.

199
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:13,545
Last week, Savage's forces
laid waste to Tokyo.

200
00:10:13,547 --> 00:10:16,414
London is the last patch
of free ground on the planet.

201
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,183
Savage's armies have cut down

202
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:21,086
the most formidable militaries
in the world.

203
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:24,022
What do you men think you can do
against an evil like this?

204
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:42,974
There were no survivors
from the attack.

205
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,376
No, whatever weapon
Savage used against the rebels

206
00:10:44,378 --> 00:10:46,911
was quite effective.

207
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:48,613
Maybe Professor Stein and I
should survey the wreckage,

208
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:50,148
analyze some soil samples,

209
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,317
determine what kind of weaponry
Savage is using.

210
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:54,285
Until we figure out a way
to thwart his firepower,

211
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:55,420
the rebels are
as good as dead.

212
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:56,621
But remember
why we're here:

213
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:59,324
To stop Savage,
not to slow him down.

214
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,960
Do we have a plan
for stealing this bracelet?

215
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:03,094
We're on it.

216
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:04,329
Please don't tell me
the plan

217
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:05,664
is to walk
into Savage's citadel

218
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,132
and steal it off her wrist.

219
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:10,001
All right,
I won't tell you that.

220
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:13,438
All right,
well, we still have the issue

221
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,274
of how to turn a piece
of jewelry into a lethal weapon.

222
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:18,243
Perhaps there is reference
to the bracelet

223
00:11:18,245 --> 00:11:21,046
in Professor Boardman's diary.

224
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:22,614
I doubt it.

225
00:11:22,616 --> 00:11:26,084
I've read through my son's
research a thousand times.

226
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:28,720
Savage has
a devastating weapon

227
00:11:28,722 --> 00:11:33,024
at his command, and here now,
at the eleventh hour,

228
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:36,528
we could sorely use
a weapon of our own.

229
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,329
I'll look into it.

230
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:42,400
This is such a waste of time.

231
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:44,469
I've already looked through
every single page

232
00:11:44,471 --> 00:11:46,337
of Aldus' notebooks.

233
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:48,206
If he had written something
specific about the bracelet

234
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,508
and killing Savage,
I would have known it already.

235
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:55,213
Here it is.

236
00:12:00,187 --> 00:12:02,087
You ever think about him?

237
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:05,423
Carter?

238
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:07,192
I try not to.

239
00:12:07,194 --> 00:12:09,694
It's not like
I'll ever see him again.

240
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:12,630
Not in this lifetime, anyway.

241
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:16,167
Besides, Carter is my past.

242
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:18,303
Ray is my future.

243
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:21,473
Still,
4,000-year-long relationship...

244
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:23,408
Seems like it'd be
hard to get over.

245
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,744
Yeah.

246
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:28,847
Maybe once Savage is gone,
I can finally start to.

247
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,662
Wow.

248
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,032
What's the occasion?

249
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:52,504
- I'll give you one guess.
- Our anniversary?

250
00:12:52,506 --> 00:12:54,072
Look, I'm sorry,
but in my defense,

251
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:55,406
there's quite a few of them
to remember.

252
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:59,644
We were only married in...
Eight lifetimes.

253
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:01,446
That's a lot.

254
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,615
But I do remember

255
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:05,316
your Victorian England
incarnation

256
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:07,852
being particularly tough
to be pinned down.

257
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:13,491
Why are you
handing this to me?

258
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:15,126
Well,
it's an anniversary gift.

259
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,561
Oh.

260
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:18,797
You have got to stop giving me
weapons as presents.

261
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:21,766
I think it's time
you learn how to use it.

262
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:23,368
But it's your weapon.

263
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,069
Savage has murdered us
countless times,

264
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:27,238
and we aren't always
lucky enough to die together.

265
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,640
This is awfully depressing
talk for our anniversary,

266
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:30,643
don't you think?

267
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:33,344
Kendra, this is important.

268
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:35,213
I need to know
that if I go first,

269
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:37,115
you have everything you need
to face him.

270
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:39,777
I don't want to think
about facing Savage...

271
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:42,546
or life... without you.

272
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:52,429
You'll never be without me,

273
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:53,598
no matter what.

274
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,366
I'll always be near.

275
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:58,303
Just give it a try.

276
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,309
Who's to say
I'll ever be strong enough

277
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:06,644
to kill Savage by myself?

278
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:09,113
Just trust me.

279
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:10,915
You have everything you need.

280
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:21,492
What is it?

281
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:24,229
I think I know what we can use
to kill Savage.

282
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:45,483
Savage has warned you all

283
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:47,919
about the radicals
who oppose us.

284
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:51,356
They will not show you the mercy
I just did.

285
00:14:51,358 --> 00:14:52,991
Dismissed.

286
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:02,300
I said you're dismissed.

287
00:15:06,673 --> 00:15:09,340
Oh, we thought you said
"missed".

288
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:11,576
Whoever you are,
you're certainly persistent.

289
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:14,178
Not really.

290
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,281
We just like
bright, sparkly objects,

291
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:19,417
like that bracelet.

292
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,653
You'd risk dying
for a bauble?

293
00:15:21,655 --> 00:15:25,189
It works with my outfit.

294
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:32,330
What now, Mr. Snart?

295
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:34,032
How do you know my name?

296
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,774
There I was, thinking
we could go a whole week

297
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:44,542
without kidnapping anyone.

298
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:45,977
I think you'll find
it would have been better

299
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:47,345
to simply kill me.

300
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:48,746
I agree.

301
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:50,448
It's a little more complicated
than that.

302
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,383
She knew who I was.

303
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:55,219
I know who all of you are.

304
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:57,622
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Gareeb.

305
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:02,827
I see Savage has been rather
chatty with his Lieutenants.

306
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:06,497
If you think I am
merely Savage's soldier,

307
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:08,633
you're more idiotic
than he claimed.

308
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:12,870
I'm not his Lieutenant.

309
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,341
I'm his daughter.

310
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:31,556
Vandal Savage
has a daughter?

311
00:16:31,558 --> 00:16:33,891
Apparently it's true.
There's a lid for every pot.

312
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:36,694
And this lid is gonna be
very upset when he finds out

313
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:37,862
that we took his pot.

314
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:40,698
You know what I mean.

315
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,600
So what's the problem?

316
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:44,769
It's not like we're on Savage's
Christmas card list.

317
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:46,471
And we snagged the bracelet.

318
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:48,006
You're welcome, by the way.

319
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:49,874
We need to weaponize
that thing before Savage knows

320
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:51,576
that it and his daughter
are missing.

321
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:54,312
Actually, I think
I've got that figured out.

322
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:56,581
But I'm gonna need you
to burn something for me.

323
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:57,749
About time.

324
00:16:57,751 --> 00:16:59,384
We also need to figure out

325
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:00,986
what we're going to do
with our new guest.

326
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:02,687
She's seen us and the ship.

327
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,689
If she runs back to Savage,
we're giving him

328
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:05,957
a huge advantage.

329
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:07,792
So we make her our advantage.

330
00:17:07,794 --> 00:17:09,861
We send papa Savage a finger.

331
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:11,829
And we keep sending them

332
00:17:11,831 --> 00:17:14,031
till he puts his own head
on the chopping block.

333
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:16,364
That is a positively
lurid idea.

334
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,569
I know we're in the midst
of a war,

335
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:18,903
but can't we maintain our honor?

336
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:21,506
I'd rather maintain my life,
Professor.

337
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:23,841
If she is Savage's daughter,
then she would know

338
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:25,576
the details of his defenses.

339
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:26,878
Yes, well, how exactly
are we going to get

340
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,946
those details out of her?

341
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:30,014
I'm on it.

342
00:17:35,622 --> 00:17:38,689
Hello, Cassie.
May I call you Cassie?

343
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:41,059
Here's the deal.
You have information.

344
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:42,460
I want it.

345
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:44,362
The question is,

346
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:46,097
how am I gonna get it?

347
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,769
I'm the daughter
of Vandal Savage,

348
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:54,605
the immortal ruler
of the world.

349
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:57,875
Do you think he hasn't
prepared me for this?

350
00:17:57,877 --> 00:17:59,677
Do you think I haven't
already been taught

351
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,846
to endure the
most extreme suffering?

352
00:18:01,848 --> 00:18:05,683
You know, your father
sounds a lot like mine.

353
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:08,486
Could never really say,
"I love you",

354
00:18:08,488 --> 00:18:10,721
except with his fists.

355
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:13,624
Our fathers
are nothing alike,

356
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:15,760
Mr. Snart.

357
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:21,766
14 years ago, the world
was ruled by a madman,

358
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,568
Per Degaton.

359
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,703
He unleashed
the Armageddon virus

360
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:27,839
in order to conquer the globe.

361
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:31,042
It tore through the world
like a fire.

362
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:34,779
Millions died,
including my mother.

363
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:39,750
There were riots, wars.
Hell on Earth.

364
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:42,787
No one dared to stand up
to Degaton,

365
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:46,390
except for my father.

366
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:48,559
He may not be a kind man,

367
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:49,927
but he is
the only one capable

368
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:53,631
of putting this world
back together.

369
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:57,668
So you can torture me
if you like.

370
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:00,905
My suffering's
a small price to pay.

371
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,775
Who said anything
about torture?

372
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,485
You sure you can do this?

373
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:17,755
Bash Savage's skull
with Carter's mace?

374
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:19,123
You got a better plan?

375
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,159
It's not the weapon
I'm worried about.

376
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:23,794
Thousands of years
of reincarnation,

377
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:26,998
and I'm guessing you've killed
a grand total of nobody.

378
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,801
Yet here you are, entering
into the Olympics of murder.

379
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:32,003
What's your point?

380
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:34,772
You sure you can
look Savage in the eye

381
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:38,576
and kill him?

382
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:42,046
- I'm sure.
- Well, you better be.

383
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:44,182
Otherwise, you're gonna end up
like the last guy

384
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:46,651
who swung that thing.

385
00:19:57,462 --> 00:20:00,131
Savage's superweapon
isn't an explosive.

386
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:02,466
The exact conclusion
I've just come to

387
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:04,769
after examining soil samples
from the attack site.

388
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:06,103
How did you determine it?

389
00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:09,140
Gideon... she found
a defunct spy satellite.

390
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:12,109
Look at the photos here.
This is the camp.

391
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:13,578
And here is the camp,
destroyed.

392
00:20:15,148 --> 00:20:17,848
Look at the impact craters.
Sort of squint your eyes.

393
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,250
What do they look like?

394
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:23,087
What am I supposed
to be seeing?

395
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:25,256
Oh, my god.

396
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:27,625
Those are not
impact craters.

397
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:31,796
They're footprints.

398
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,777
Sir, we've located
the rebels responsible

399
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:48,279
for your daughter's abduction.

400
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:51,082
The leviathan is two clicks
from their encampment.

401
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:53,784
Find my daughter.

402
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:56,687
And burn them all.

403
00:20:58,825 --> 00:21:01,025
He's coming for me.

404
00:21:01,027 --> 00:21:04,695
Yeah, you and a bunch
of innocent refugees.

405
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:06,197
If they were innocent,

406
00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:09,066
they wouldn't have rebelled
against my father.

407
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,137
Whatever it is,
it's getting closer.

408
00:21:13,139 --> 00:21:15,573
Well, we're a little short
on weapons.

409
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:17,875
Look, if we can't outrun it,
we'll just have to fight it.

410
00:21:17,877 --> 00:21:19,110
Well, I mean, we can...

411
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:24,882
But what about them?

412
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:33,157
This way.
Move along.

413
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:35,559
Everything's all right.
Move along.

414
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:37,895
Everything's fine.

415
00:21:37,897 --> 00:21:39,964
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

416
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:41,699
Saving a township,
by the looks of it.

417
00:21:41,701 --> 00:21:43,567
Since when did my vessel
become a life raft?

418
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:44,935
Since I decided we can't

419
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:46,337
leave these people here
to be slaughtered.

420
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:48,005
You recruited us
to save the world.

421
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:50,207
That includes everyone here.

422
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:52,243
Gideon, power the engines
and get us into the air

423
00:21:52,245 --> 00:21:54,145
the moment the last refugee
is aboard.

424
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:57,882
And get the weapons system
online.

425
00:21:57,884 --> 00:21:59,650
What's happening?

426
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:01,585
It would seem Savage has
come back for his baby girl.

427
00:22:01,587 --> 00:22:03,120
<i>The last of the refugees
are aboard, Captain.</i>

428
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:04,655
Strap yourself in.

429
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:07,058
Gideon, external floodlights
to maximum.

430
00:22:18,905 --> 00:22:20,871
- That's...
- Incredible.

431
00:22:29,716 --> 00:22:31,282
Ugh! Fire! Now!

432
00:22:34,754 --> 00:22:36,921
Hold on to something!

433
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:51,035
Fire, Gideon! Fire everything!

434
00:22:54,307 --> 00:22:56,674
Now might be a good time
to start praying.

435
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:23,334
- Gideon, what's our status?
- I'm gonna go with "lousy".

436
00:23:23,336 --> 00:23:25,803
Shut down all essential
systems so Savage's robot...

437
00:23:25,805 --> 00:23:27,872
<i>Too late, Captain;
Apparently, it has determined</i>

438
00:23:27,874 --> 00:23:29,240
<i>you are still alive,
because it is closing in</i>

439
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:30,274
<i>on our location.</i>

440
00:23:30,276 --> 00:23:32,076
What happened?

441
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:33,377
We seem to have encountered
Savage's megaweapon.

442
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:34,779
And he kicked our ass.

443
00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:35,946
Gideon, how much time
do we have?

444
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:37,448
<i>I estimate the robot</i>

445
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,383
<i>should reach our location
within the hour.</i>

446
00:23:39,385 --> 00:23:41,385
<i>Our propulsion engine was
severely damaged in the crash</i>

447
00:23:41,387 --> 00:23:42,720
<i>and is no longer functioning.</i>

448
00:23:42,722 --> 00:23:44,188
So where does that leave us?

449
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:46,290
All right, our only option
is to take the jumpship

450
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:47,358
and try and outrun it.

451
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,926
The jumpship seats seven.

452
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:50,361
The cargo bay's filled
with refugees.

453
00:23:50,363 --> 00:23:51,929
I'm well aware.

454
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:53,798
Well, we can't
just leave them there; We...

455
00:23:57,302 --> 00:23:59,370
Martin!

456
00:23:59,372 --> 00:24:02,940
Professor, you are gonna be
just fine.

457
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:03,941
I promise you.

458
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:06,210
Grey, what happened?

459
00:24:06,212 --> 00:24:07,878
You have to take care
of them.

460
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,113
Don't worry.
We got the team's back.

461
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:11,715
No. The people.
Those children.

462
00:24:11,717 --> 00:24:13,717
You can't leave them here.

463
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:15,553
You can't... you can't...

464
00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:19,123
<i>I’ve administered
a mild sedative.</i>

465
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:20,791
<i>He should be comfortable.</i>

466
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,927
Which is more than can be said
for the rest of us.

467
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:29,867
I was wrong.
Your dad's a gem.

468
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:32,369
He's just doing what he must
to save his daughter.

469
00:24:32,371 --> 00:24:34,205
Whatever you say.
Now, where was I?

470
00:24:34,207 --> 00:24:36,807
Oh, right.
Convincing you to help us.

471
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:40,010
What a charming euphemism
for interrogation.

472
00:24:40,012 --> 00:24:42,346
I know what you're thinking:
"My dad may not be perfect,

473
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:46,016
but deep down,
he's not a bad guy."

474
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:50,387
What are you doing?

475
00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:54,458
Showing you that when it comes
to crap fathers,

476
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,061
there is no "deep down".

477
00:24:57,063 --> 00:24:58,863
After you.

478
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,843
These are the ones
we could save.

479
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:14,545
The rest are ash,

480
00:25:14,547 --> 00:25:16,380
much like delta camp.

481
00:25:16,382 --> 00:25:18,349
You don't know
my father at all

482
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:21,051
if you think his daughter
could be so easily manipulated.

483
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:22,553
Just trying to show you
the truth.

484
00:25:22,555 --> 00:25:25,122
The truth is, my father
was trying to save me.

485
00:25:25,124 --> 00:25:28,893
From what, untrained civilians
with barely any weapons?

486
00:25:28,895 --> 00:25:30,861
Your father sent
a 200-foot robot

487
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:32,429
to level a bunch of tents.

488
00:25:32,431 --> 00:25:35,866
The people in that camp
were rebels, dangerous radicals.

489
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:37,101
Please.

490
00:25:37,103 --> 00:25:38,869
Do these people look
like radicals to you?

491
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:42,873
They're nobodies...
Everyday folk hoping to survive

492
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:45,242
your father's reign of terror.

493
00:25:45,244 --> 00:25:49,813
Look, took me a long time to
accept my old man was a monster.

494
00:25:49,815 --> 00:25:52,816
I'm betting you're smarter
than I am.

495
00:25:52,818 --> 00:25:54,051
At last,

496
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:55,553
something we agree on.

497
00:25:57,822 --> 00:26:01,492
Oh, Per Degaton didn't release
the Armageddon virus.

498
00:26:01,494 --> 00:26:03,994
That was your father.

499
00:26:03,996 --> 00:26:05,529
Impossible.

500
00:26:05,531 --> 00:26:07,565
He was only
Per Degaton's tutor.

501
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:10,301
One, Per Degaton was
only a teenager at the time.

502
00:26:10,303 --> 00:26:13,337
Two, he was hardly
a criminal mastermind.

503
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:15,339
Your father, however...

504
00:26:15,341 --> 00:26:17,908
What makes you think I'd
believe anything you tell me?

505
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,944
Because seeing is believing.

506
00:26:19,946 --> 00:26:23,247
Gideon, show her the footage.

507
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:27,418
Kasnia, November 3, 2147.

508
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:30,387
<i>The world's population
is unsustainable</i>

509
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:32,856
<i>at current levels.</i>

510
00:26:32,858 --> 00:26:34,959
<i>The herd must be thinned.</i>

511
00:26:34,961 --> 00:26:36,393
This isn't true.

512
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:40,431
You're a liar.

513
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:43,000
Correct.
But not about this.

514
00:26:43,002 --> 00:26:45,035
And you know it...

515
00:26:45,037 --> 00:26:47,271
Deep down.

516
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:03,487
How are repairs coming?

517
00:27:03,489 --> 00:27:05,289
Are repairs coming?

518
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:06,657
Not in 30 minutes,

519
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:09,026
which is about
as much time as we have.

520
00:27:09,028 --> 00:27:10,527
We brought all those people
on board,

521
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:12,396
and all we've bought them
is an extra few minutes

522
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:14,398
to live in fear.

523
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,100
Well, I guess the question is,

524
00:27:16,102 --> 00:27:17,134
what do we do
with those minutes?

525
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:19,503
The ship is crippled!

526
00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:22,473
Everyone aboard
is as dead as my...

527
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:24,675
Family?

528
00:27:24,677 --> 00:27:29,213
Look, I know that you think
the universe wants them dead,

529
00:27:29,215 --> 00:27:31,949
but I don't;
I don't believe in fate.

530
00:27:31,951 --> 00:27:34,652
I believe in choices.

531
00:27:34,654 --> 00:27:38,422
And we can choose...
We can choose to fight,

532
00:27:38,424 --> 00:27:41,325
even if the fight
may be futile.

533
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:43,193
We can save your family, Rip.

534
00:27:43,195 --> 00:27:46,130
It's not impossible.
All we have to do...

535
00:27:46,132 --> 00:27:47,464
Is kill Vandal Savage...

536
00:27:47,466 --> 00:27:51,101
The chances of which
appear to be fading.

537
00:27:51,103 --> 00:27:52,403
Not anymore.

538
00:27:52,405 --> 00:27:54,004
I figured out how to do it.

539
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:58,275
And my new bestie and I
can get us in.

540
00:27:58,277 --> 00:28:00,210
And I think I've got a way
to stop the giant robot

541
00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:01,712
that's coming to kill us.

542
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:09,620
Now, you may not believe
in fate, Raymond,

543
00:28:09,622 --> 00:28:12,656
but I certainly do.

544
00:28:12,658 --> 00:28:15,259
And perhaps it was fate
that compelled me

545
00:28:15,261 --> 00:28:16,960
to bring you seven together

546
00:28:16,962 --> 00:28:19,229
so we can change this future

547
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:22,066
once and for all.

548
00:28:26,706 --> 00:28:29,373
- Hey.
- Hey.

549
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:31,542
So I'm going to take on
an immortal madman,

550
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:34,111
and you are fighting
a giant robot.

551
00:28:35,514 --> 00:28:38,015
I can't believe
this is our life.

552
00:28:38,017 --> 00:28:41,251
Well, take him out,
and it won't be.

553
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:44,555
You can do this.

554
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:50,260
- Ray, if anything...
- No, no.

555
00:28:50,262 --> 00:28:52,529
Save it for after
you destroy Savage.

556
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:11,582
Sounds like
it's getting closer.

557
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:13,016
How's it going back there?

558
00:29:13,018 --> 00:29:15,319
You tell me.
This is your nutso idea.

559
00:29:15,321 --> 00:29:16,754
It's not that nutso
when you consider

560
00:29:16,756 --> 00:29:18,789
the theoretical possibility
that siphoning power

561
00:29:18,791 --> 00:29:21,492
from the auxiliary time drive
should provide enough power

562
00:29:21,494 --> 00:29:23,494
to reverse the polarity
of the dwarf star matrix.

563
00:29:23,496 --> 00:29:27,596
Sorry, Ray, I'm falling asleep
back here, man.

564
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,767
Okay. I think we're done.

565
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:31,301
All right.

566
00:29:31,303 --> 00:29:32,636
You know,
if this doesn't work...

567
00:29:32,638 --> 00:29:34,805
I'll turn every cell
in my body inside out?

568
00:29:34,807 --> 00:29:38,275
I was gonna go with "die",
but yeah.

569
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:40,344
You know, we could've escaped
on the jumpship,

570
00:29:40,346 --> 00:29:42,179
but we're doing this
to save everybody

571
00:29:42,181 --> 00:29:44,281
that we brought
on the Waverider.

572
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:46,383
You're the real hero here, Ray.

573
00:29:46,385 --> 00:29:47,651
All right.

574
00:29:47,653 --> 00:29:49,419
Stand back.

575
00:29:52,725 --> 00:29:55,125
No. Like, way back.

576
00:30:00,065 --> 00:30:01,765
All right.

577
00:30:01,767 --> 00:30:03,300
Here we go.

578
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:18,415
It worked. I'm not dead.

579
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:24,621
Yet.

580
00:30:24,623 --> 00:30:26,657
Okay, let's do this.

581
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,420
Okay. Come on.

582
00:30:56,422 --> 00:30:58,222
Ray, you got this.

583
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:10,801
The leviathan
is encountering resistance.

584
00:31:10,803 --> 00:31:12,569
Impossible.

585
00:31:15,608 --> 00:31:17,574
Dr. Palmer.

586
00:31:17,576 --> 00:31:18,675
Clever.

587
00:31:18,677 --> 00:31:20,210
Sir?

588
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:21,445
What?

589
00:31:29,255 --> 00:31:31,488
I've been so worried.

590
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,158
How did you...

591
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,928
I am your daughter.

592
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:40,564
Did you really think some
rabble could hold me captive?

593
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:42,399
Rabble?

594
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:45,469
These are the time travelers
I warned you of.

595
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,306
Father?

596
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:55,345
Your bracelet.

597
00:31:55,347 --> 00:31:57,481
It's gone.

598
00:31:57,483 --> 00:32:01,351
I-I must have lost it
in my escape.

599
00:32:01,353 --> 00:32:03,353
Ah.

600
00:32:03,355 --> 00:32:06,690
As the person who tutored you
in the art of deceit,

601
00:32:06,692 --> 00:32:09,526
you cannot fool me,
Cassandra.

602
00:32:09,528 --> 00:32:12,229
Like you fooled me?

603
00:32:12,231 --> 00:32:14,631
You told me my mother died
from the Armageddon virus.

604
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:16,633
But you were the one
who released it.

605
00:32:16,635 --> 00:32:18,869
Tell me it isn't true.

606
00:32:18,871 --> 00:32:21,638
I might even pretend
to believe you.

607
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:41,792
Let me go.

608
00:32:41,794 --> 00:32:44,328
Call them.

609
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:46,797
Call the ones
that you no doubt helped

610
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,665
gain access to my bunker.

611
00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:50,968
No need to trouble yourself,
Miss Savage.

612
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:54,271
We're already here.

613
00:32:54,273 --> 00:32:58,308
Oh, I admire your command
of irony, Gareeb...

614
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:02,779
Using my own child against me.

615
00:33:02,781 --> 00:33:05,349
Sorry to say
it didn't take much.

616
00:33:05,351 --> 00:33:06,950
None at all, you ass.

617
00:33:06,952 --> 00:33:09,353
They showed me the truth
of what you've done.

618
00:33:09,355 --> 00:33:10,520
The innocent...

619
00:33:10,522 --> 00:33:12,656
Do not speak
as if you know anything

620
00:33:12,658 --> 00:33:15,692
about ruling a people.

621
00:33:15,694 --> 00:33:19,563
Do you really want
to align your fate

622
00:33:19,565 --> 00:33:22,733
with these... pretenders?

623
00:33:22,735 --> 00:33:24,701
They're nothing
but grains of sand

624
00:33:24,703 --> 00:33:26,737
in the desert of time.

625
00:33:26,739 --> 00:33:29,539
You are a monster.

626
00:33:44,757 --> 00:33:46,323
<i>Don't just wrestle with him.</i>

627
00:33:46,325 --> 00:33:48,291
Remember,
you got laser blasters.

628
00:33:48,293 --> 00:33:50,027
Actually,
they're compressed light beams.

629
00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:52,362
Well, whatever they're called,
just hit him with them.

630
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,599
Oh, come on!

631
00:33:55,601 --> 00:33:56,666
Yeah!

632
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:03,607
She's here.

633
00:34:03,609 --> 00:34:06,843
I can sense her.

634
00:34:06,845 --> 00:34:10,914
You do realize
that she can do me no harm?

635
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:13,383
Clearly,
you didn't get the memo.

636
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:19,022
Aah!

637
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:47,884
Aah!

638
00:34:47,886 --> 00:34:49,786
Agh!

639
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:07,838
Ha! I could
really get used to this.

640
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,107
Stay on him, Ray.
Stay on him.

641
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:24,454
Agh!

642
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:36,766
I had it covered.

643
00:35:36,768 --> 00:35:37,834
Sure, you did.

644
00:35:47,746 --> 00:35:49,012
<i>Get up, Ray!</i>

645
00:35:49,014 --> 00:35:50,514
Ray, get up!

646
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:57,087
This is for Carter.

647
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:19,643
Unh!

648
00:36:34,993 --> 00:36:38,028
Your love...

649
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:40,664
Reincarnated.

650
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:45,101
He doesn't even remember
who he was...

651
00:36:45,103 --> 00:36:47,237
And he never will.

652
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:48,538
What?

653
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,575
When I first discovered him,

654
00:36:51,577 --> 00:36:55,712
when I found out that he had
no idea about his real identity,

655
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:57,814
I took my precautions

656
00:36:57,816 --> 00:37:00,817
and I locked his mind away.

657
00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:02,953
You brainwashed him!

658
00:37:02,955 --> 00:37:04,654
Come on!

659
00:37:05,857 --> 00:37:07,691
Strike me down.

660
00:37:07,693 --> 00:37:09,025
Kill me.

661
00:37:09,027 --> 00:37:11,895
But do so knowing
that I am the only one

662
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:14,731
holding the key to his mind.

663
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,207
<i>Get up, Ray.
Get up.</i>

664
00:37:24,209 --> 00:37:26,776
Rip said you told him
you don't believe in fate...

665
00:37:26,778 --> 00:37:28,578
Just choices.

666
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:31,047
<i>Well, you got
a choice to make right now.</i>

667
00:37:31,049 --> 00:37:33,850
You got to choose
to get up and fight.

668
00:37:33,852 --> 00:37:36,820
<i>You got to choose to live.</i>

669
00:37:58,042 --> 00:37:59,676
Whoo! Come on!

670
00:38:06,985 --> 00:38:08,918
That's what I'm talking about,
baby!

671
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:15,925
Ha-ha!

672
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:17,927
Kendra,
what are you waiting for?

673
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:19,129
Finish him!

674
00:38:19,131 --> 00:38:21,798
Destroy me,
and you doom him.

675
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,769
It's Carter.

676
00:38:25,771 --> 00:38:27,804
The reinforcements
are coming!

677
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,939
Whatever you plan on doing,

678
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:31,074
Kendra, do it!

679
00:38:33,211 --> 00:38:37,180
If I kill Savage,
his mind will be lost.

680
00:38:37,182 --> 00:38:42,585
And if you don't,
I will lose my wife and son.

681
00:38:42,587 --> 00:38:46,589
Well, my love,
what's it gonna be, huh?

682
00:38:46,591 --> 00:38:49,159
Come on!

683
00:38:49,161 --> 00:38:50,226
Ugh!

684
00:38:53,197 --> 00:38:55,965
I can't.

685
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:58,668
I'm so sorry, Rip. I can't.

686
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:05,642
We need to get them
back to the ship.

687
00:39:05,644 --> 00:39:06,643
Both of them.

688
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:15,985
You! What's to keep me from
killing you where you stand?

689
00:39:15,987 --> 00:39:19,255
Because she's an asset
to the cause.

690
00:39:19,257 --> 00:39:21,758
My father may be
incapacitated,

691
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,060
but his forces
are still strong.

692
00:39:24,062 --> 00:39:27,364
I know their tactics,
their weaknesses.

693
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,968
Why the change of heart?

694
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:33,269
Ask him.

695
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:45,115
Hey. I saw Sara.

696
00:39:45,117 --> 00:39:46,750
She said you brought Savage
back onto the ship,

697
00:39:46,752 --> 00:39:48,485
but she was a little stingy
on the details.

698
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:51,921
Is everything okay?

699
00:39:56,161 --> 00:39:59,062
Ray,

700
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:00,764
we need to talk.

701
00:40:11,843 --> 00:40:13,042
Welcome back.

702
00:40:13,044 --> 00:40:14,778
Ah.

703
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:17,147
Well, the team managed
to capture Savage,

704
00:40:17,149 --> 00:40:20,350
battle his army
and a giant robot...

705
00:40:20,352 --> 00:40:23,253
And you managed to sleep
through all of it.

706
00:40:23,255 --> 00:40:25,422
Hmm.

707
00:40:25,424 --> 00:40:26,723
The refugees...

708
00:40:26,725 --> 00:40:28,758
They're safe.

709
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,960
Every one of them
is alive and well.

710
00:40:30,962 --> 00:40:33,396
But for how long?

711
00:40:33,398 --> 00:40:36,900
Apparently,
time wants to happen.

712
00:40:36,902 --> 00:40:39,869
Oh, I think you'll find
that time...

713
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:41,871
For once...

714
00:40:41,873 --> 00:40:44,140
Is on our side.

715
00:40:46,044 --> 00:40:47,777
Now,

716
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:49,946
if you'll excuse me,

717
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:52,515
I have to pay a visit
to an old friend.

718
00:40:57,456 --> 00:41:00,256
Well, you seem quite happy
for a man behind bars.

719
00:41:00,258 --> 00:41:02,325
Why shouldn't I be happy?

720
00:41:02,327 --> 00:41:05,495
It seems that you once again
have failed to kill me.

721
00:41:05,497 --> 00:41:07,964
A momentary setback,
I assure you.

722
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:10,099
Assure yourself.

723
00:41:10,101 --> 00:41:11,801
Providence has allowed me

724
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:17,173
to place Chay-Ara
in an impossible situation:

725
00:41:17,175 --> 00:41:21,344
A choice between
her own soul mate, Carter...

726
00:41:21,346 --> 00:41:22,412
And yours.

727
00:41:24,382 --> 00:41:26,449
You know, a friend recently
suggested to me

728
00:41:26,451 --> 00:41:31,221
that there is no such thing
as fate.

729
00:41:31,223 --> 00:41:35,525
Destiny is nothing more
than the sum of our own choices.

730
00:41:35,527 --> 00:41:38,094
I see.

731
00:41:38,096 --> 00:41:40,897
So you still think
there's hope, then...

732
00:41:40,899 --> 00:41:42,398
For your family.

733
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:47,403
Time will tell, Captain.

734
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:52,375
Time will tell.
