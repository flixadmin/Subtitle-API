1
00:00:01,235 --> 00:00:04,770
<i>There's a war coming...
a terrible war.</i>

2
00:00:04,772 --> 00:00:06,405
<i>There will be chaos.
Rivers of blood</i>

3
00:00:06,407 --> 00:00:07,539
In the streets.

4
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:09,875
I know it.
I can see it coming.

5
00:00:09,877 --> 00:00:11,543
<i>It's time.
Somebody has to take over.</i>

6
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:12,844
It might as well be me.

7
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:17,516
<i>My name's james gordon.
I'm a detective.</i>

8
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:19,318
My name is bruce wayne.
<i>I promise i will</i>

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,519
Find the man who did this.

10
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:22,120
Stop or i'll shoot!

11
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:24,423
<i>He was framed... to cover up</i>

12
00:00:24,425 --> 00:00:26,024
For the real killer.

13
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,192
I know that you own
the police department.

14
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:28,794
Probably the mayor.

15
00:00:28,796 --> 00:00:31,697
You can't have organized crime
without law and order.

16
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:33,198
You snitched,

17
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,100
My little penguin.

18
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:36,735
Please!

19
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:38,370
Falcone wants you to put
a bullet in his head.

20
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:40,072
<i>Then everybody knows
you're with the program.</i>

21
00:00:40,074 --> 00:00:42,074
Don't ever come back
to gotham.

22
00:01:04,465 --> 00:01:06,465
Ah, there you are.

23
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:09,000
Been all over
the bloody house

24
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:11,069
Looking for you.

25
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:15,640
What are you doing?

26
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:17,275
Nothing.

27
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:20,278
You, my old son,
are a terrible liar.

28
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,180
What have you got there?

29
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:25,684
Come on. Show me.

30
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:33,592
Oh, my god,
you stupid little boy!

31
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,927
Oh.

32
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,029
It's all right. I'm sorry.

33
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:40,232
It's gonna be all right.

34
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:10,962
Hi! I'm patti.

35
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,230
This is doug.

36
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:13,498
We're with
the mayor's

37
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,566
Homeless outreach project.

38
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:16,501
We have some sandwiches
and some soup.

39
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:17,569
We got cookies,
got candy.

40
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:19,171
Who here likes chocolate?

41
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:23,542
Ain't you hungry, cat?

42
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:26,978
Yeah, dig in.
Take a sandwich.

43
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,581
This is what i need.
Sure, go ahead.

44
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,516
Plenty for everyone.

45
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,718
Yeah, sure. Take two.

46
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:39,391
Hey!

47
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:40,459
Hey, lady.

48
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:48,433
Oh, fudge!

49
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:49,534
Don't worry. I'll go.

50
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:53,038
Slow down there,
buckaroo.

51
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,291
I got you one,
but i dropped it.

52
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:48,393
Yeah, thanks.

53
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:49,628
Where is everybody?

54
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,162
I don't know.

55
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:52,631
What do you think?

56
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:55,100
I think it's been a long shift.
We give this bum three hours,

57
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:56,935
Then we knock off.

58
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:58,103
He was a vet.

59
00:03:58,105 --> 00:03:59,105
I salute his service.

60
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:00,305
Now he's a dead bum.

61
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:01,907
People are shooting bums

62
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,643
All the time. We might as well
be looking for the tooth fairy.

63
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:06,711
Hey, guys.
Hey, bo.

64
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:09,014
How come you weren't here?

65
00:04:09,016 --> 00:04:11,182
Whoa, whoa.
Good morning to you, too.

66
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:13,285
Where were you?
I was at a restaurant
down the street here,

67
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:15,921
Chez vous. They had
some homeless junkie kid,

68
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:18,290
Fell through their
front window last night.

69
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:19,391
I been taking care of that.

70
00:04:19,393 --> 00:04:20,525
This is a potential murder.

71
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:22,027
You're first responder.

72
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:24,029
You're supposed to preserve the
integrity of the crime scene.

73
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:25,730
He's got a point.
Well,

74
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:28,600
The restaurant that pays me $50
a month to look out for them.

75
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:32,037
So i'm gonna babysit
a dead wino? I got a family.

76
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:33,538
He's got a point.

77
00:04:34,575 --> 00:04:36,207
Why'd the kid
jump through the window?

78
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:37,676
Who knows? He was high.

79
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:39,844
Did you ask him?
Why am i the bad guy here?

80
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:42,781
I'm asking about the
kid because maybe he's
related to the victim.

81
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:45,216
And you're not a bad guy...
you're just a bad cop.

82
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,351
Whoa. Who you talking to?

83
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:47,786
You know, i already had...
Hold on.

84
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,020
Come on. Come on!

85
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,589
You want it? Any day!

86
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:52,524
Hey! Whoa!

87
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,229
<i>And then zeb and smoke
went right down,</i>

88
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:01,399
And that's when that wacky
dude just shot soldier.

89
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:03,301
That's when i realized
i needed to get out of there.

90
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,769
So i ran and i ran,
and that's how

91
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:06,705
I ended up on the floor
of that restaurant.

92
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:08,873
She used a pin.

93
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,875
I swear.
A big pin.

94
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:13,411
But, listen, this is
not the first time.

95
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:16,314
Street kids have been
disappearing for weeks now.

96
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,216
By the dozen.
No one knows why.

97
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:20,685
First we heard about it.
Why-why would you?

98
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:22,954
Nobody gives a crap about us.

99
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:24,422
I mean, look! That is proof!

100
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:26,958
That's not proof. That's a scab.
Now, listen, macky,

101
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,793
We're grown-ups.
We're smarter than you.

102
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:30,895
Man, whatever.
So you're gonna...
You're gonna tell me the truth!

103
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:32,163
It was you, wasn't it?

104
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,165
It was you that killed
that poor old man.

105
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,167
It was you. Now, you're gonna
tell me the truth, or i swear

106
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,836
To god, i'm gonna beat it
out of you!

107
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,904
That old man was a war veteran!
Listen,

108
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:41,539
Cat was there. Cat saw
the whole thing. Ask cat.

109
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,674
Ask cat!
Relax, macky, relax.

110
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,175
No one's gonna beat you.
Who's cat?

111
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,410
What do you mean,
no one's gonna beat him?

112
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:46,778
Isn't that what i
just said i was gonna do

113
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,979
Right now, just now?
I was gonna beat him?

114
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:49,748
Come here! Come here. Come here.

115
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:53,351
He is 16.

116
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,521
Yeah, and six-foot, 220.
He can take a punch.

117
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,790
Look, i wasn't gonna beat him.
I just wanted to scare him.

118
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:00,792
But if i did want to beat him,
i could.

119
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:02,861
It would be my prerogative.
It's illegal.

120
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,362
Ill...

121
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,798
How now so righteous?

122
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,634
Hmm? Not long since you
put a man in the river.

123
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:14,606
You want to say that
a little louder?

124
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:16,441
Not everybody heard.

125
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:18,810
Ever since then, you've been
a royal pain in the ass.
You think i or anybody

126
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:21,246
Around here gives a crap
about a dead snitch

127
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:22,547
Or your guilty
conscience?

128
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,282
We got our own problems.
Guilty conscience,

129
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:26,284
Call it what you want.
I'm gonna do what's right.

130
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:28,286
You're beginning to irritate me.

131
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:29,621
Get your hands off me.

132
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:31,456
Hey!

133
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,925
Watch the shoes, clown.

134
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:39,764
Shift's over.

135
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:04,355
Come on.

136
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:05,690
Come on.

137
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:08,093
Come on.
Seriously.

138
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:20,138
Thank you so much,
guys, truly.

139
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,674
I'm very grateful.
I've been waiting for hours.

140
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:25,376
No kidding. Look like you
crawled out of a cemetery.

141
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:28,446
Smells like it, too.
Open a window back there.

142
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:32,051
There you go.
Yeah.

143
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:33,351
Yes, thank you.

144
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:36,121
Forgive me,
i am somewhat disheveled.

145
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:38,189
A temporary setback,
i assure you.

146
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,425
Thank you so much.

147
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:42,527
What the hell happened
to you anyhow?

148
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:44,395
It was my own fault.

149
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:46,631
Foolish arrogance
led me astray.

150
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:50,135
But i learned my lessons.

151
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:55,607
I'll be back,
stronger and smarter than ever.

152
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:56,908
Good luck with that, bro.

153
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,477
Here i am riding around
in a lovely truck,

154
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,946
Sharing an ice-cold beer
with my new friends.

155
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,948
My luck's already
turned, right?

156
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:07,952
Dude, anyone ever tell you,
when you walk,

157
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:09,254
You look just like a penguin?

158
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:13,491
No.

159
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,995
Nobody's ever told me that.

160
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,809
<i>He's saying he has a right to
stop me from beating on a mope.</i>

161
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:31,876
Damn right i do.

162
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:33,144
How am i supposed
to work with this?

163
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:35,380
Look it, jim, it's not
like i can order you

164
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:37,682
To break the law,
but this is gotham.

165
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,818
You don't bend,
you'll get broke.

166
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,885
I understand.
I thought

167
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:42,153
You were with the program.

168
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:43,721
He is.
Well, let's get back
to work.

169
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:46,925
Where are you at?
Well, if the boy we have
is telling the truth,

170
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:48,927
There's a couple of kidnappers
out there

171
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:51,362
Abducting homeless children
in numbers.

172
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,264
They lured them close
with a food truck

173
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:55,166
From the mayor's homeless
outreach project.

174
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:57,602
And they drugged them
with a jab from a big pin.

175
00:08:57,604 --> 00:08:59,270
Wh-why would anyone want
to abduct

176
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:01,506
Scaggly-ass
orphans in bulk?

177
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:02,674
I mean, where's the market?

178
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:03,842
They're out on the street

179
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:05,076
Because no one
wants them anyway.

180
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:06,344
If they said
they were snatching

181
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:08,112
Cute girls, i'd believe 'em.

182
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:10,615
But what would anyone want
with a lard-ass like macky?

183
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:12,016
What is it, ed?

184
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:17,455
Guess what i found.

185
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:19,824
I did a blood test
on him, and he had

186
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:21,826
High levels of atp.

187
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:24,128
What's atp?

188
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,464
It's a fast-acting
knockout drug.

189
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:28,366
They used to use it
at the old arkham asylum

190
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:30,668
To bring down
troublesome patients.

191
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,670
It's hard to get.

192
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:32,904
No recreational use.

193
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,340
Okay. That's interesting.

194
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:36,407
Anything else?

195
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:39,410
Thank you, ed.

196
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:44,782
Thank you, ed.

197
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:49,555
Get to work.

198
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:50,889
And keep this quiet.

199
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:52,557
No press. Not a word.

200
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,859
Shouldn't we tell the
public what's going on?

201
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:57,028
Warn them?
Department policy.

202
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,697
We don't advertise this kind
of stuff. Causes panic.

203
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:02,500
The headlines will read
"gotham's kids snatched."

204
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:05,169
Which would be true.
No press.
That's an order.

205
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:07,405
Follow up on the drug,
the atp

206
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:08,973
And the arkham connection.

207
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:10,808
Arkham's been closed
for, like, ten years.

208
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:11,943
Yeah, 15.

209
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,279
Drug suppliers might
still be in business.

210
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:15,680
Oh, uh,

211
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:17,682
This happened on
fish mooney's turf.

212
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:20,418
Do you want to see if it's safe
for us to go back there,

213
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,053
Or is, uh, she still mad at us?

214
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:24,155
That's a good question.

215
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:38,169
Bravo!

216
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:39,470
Bravo!

217
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:48,046
Don falcone.

218
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:51,449
What a wonderful surprise.
Welcome.

219
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:52,784
Thank you, my dear.

220
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:54,719
Can we... Talk?

221
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:57,455
Of course. Give me a moment
to clear the place.
No, no.

222
00:10:57,457 --> 00:11:00,458
No need to
spoil the fun.

223
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,741
Men who are about to die
are very honest.

224
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:18,443
It pays to listen to them.

225
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:21,646
That's some toast.

226
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:28,019
I spoke with your man cobblepot
before he died.

227
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,823
Odd little fellow.
Perceptive.

228
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:33,725
He told me the death
of the waynes

229
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:37,095
Would bring troubled times
for our family and gotham.

230
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:39,731
What did he know?

231
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:41,299
Business is good as ever.

232
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:42,867
No, he was right.

233
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:48,006
The waynes and the falcones were
the pillars of the same house.

234
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:50,274
We understood each other.

235
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:53,211
Now that they're gone,
everything is out of balance,

236
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:56,647
And the wayne empire is in flux.

237
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:59,951
Who knows
who will end up in control?

238
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:02,720
The maroni family
senses weakness.

239
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,222
They'll start making moves,

240
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:07,325
And every criminal in the city
will start making moves.

241
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:10,028
Please don't lose any sleep
over maroni.

242
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,030
He's number two for a reason.

243
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:14,866
I never lose sleep
over my enemies.

244
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:17,602
It's my friends
that keep me awake.

245
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:20,204
Huh.
Cobblepot told me

246
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:23,241
You say i'm old and soft

247
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:26,444
And ready to be taken out,
and you're the one to take me.

248
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:31,315
Don falcone, i would never,

249
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:33,951
<i>Ever</i> say that.

250
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:37,388
I only have deep love
and respect for you.

251
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:40,725
You have been
like a father to me.

252
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:45,163
I'm so... Happy to hear that.

253
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:47,465
Let's forget all
about it, then.

254
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:50,501
The babbling of a condemned man.

255
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:57,475
Enough business.

256
00:12:57,477 --> 00:12:59,110
How have you
been, my dear?

257
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,711
Thriving, i hope.

258
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:02,980
Yes. Good. I'm good.

259
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:08,219
Which of these is your lover?

260
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:10,521
Please. My heart has been broken

261
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:13,357
Far too many times
for that nonsense.

262
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:15,159
Hmm.

263
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,361
I heard you had a lover.

264
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:18,663
Well, if you're referring

265
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:21,065
To the boy that i keep around
for exercise...

266
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:24,001
My lover he is not.

267
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,177
What's your name?

268
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:34,378
Lazlo, sir.

269
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,248
Lazlo, be good
to this woman.

270
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,417
She's very precious to me.

271
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:41,452
If you break her heart,

272
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:43,387
You break my heart.

273
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,089
Yes, sir.

274
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:47,258
Mmm.

275
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:56,000
Give me your hand.

276
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:01,272
Thank you for being honest.
It means a lot to me.

277
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:03,508
It shows wisdom

278
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,643
And humility.

279
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,924
Out!

280
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:27,165
Everyone out!

281
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:37,842
Never, never in his life

282
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:40,845
My son is away this long.

283
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:43,948
Nightclubs is his business.

284
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,716
Such hours.

285
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:50,488
But always, he comes home
to his mother.

286
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,590
His clothes are here.

287
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:54,392
My son would never

288
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,427
Leave his clothes.

289
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:59,263
Oh, so elegant, he is.

290
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:01,399
Yes, i-i show you.

291
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:04,735
Damn. Mooney and the cops
must have had him killed.

292
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,504
Looks like
the snitches get bumped.

293
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:08,072
That's life.

294
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,740
They're not going to
get away with it,

295
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,075
Not as easy as they think.

296
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,777
You take things too personally,
you know what?

297
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:15,413
Yeah, i do. That
was a good snitch.

298
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,614
- What are we...?
- Nothing.

299
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:18,115
Uh, mrs. Cobblepot...

300
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:19,517
Kapelput.

301
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,053
Mrs. Kapelput,
do you know anyone

302
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:24,355
Who might want
to do your son harm?

303
00:15:24,357 --> 00:15:26,123
Harm?

304
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:29,493
No. I-i would feel it.

305
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:31,796
A mother feels
these things.

306
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:33,698
It's a woman.

307
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:38,135
Some painted slut
has him in her clutch.

308
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:40,271
A woman... You think?

309
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,340
I am sure.

310
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:45,443
So handsome he is.

311
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,845
And so naive.

312
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:51,515
Who are you again?

313
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:55,052
Uh, detectives
with major crimes unit, ma'am.

314
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:58,122
Oh, gcpd.

315
00:15:58,124 --> 00:15:59,257
Like that.

316
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:00,958
But honest.

317
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,893
Hmm.

318
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,896
<i>Boss, don't get mad at me,</i>

319
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:07,965
But i know that look.

320
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:13,170
Now is too early to
make a move on falcone.

321
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:16,207
I know.

322
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:18,209
Not yet.

323
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:22,280
I need more money, more men,
more territory, i know.

324
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:27,518
I'll play this thing loyal
and bide my time.

325
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:32,456
But i swear, butch,

326
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,159
On my sainted mother's grave,

327
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,328
Some day soon,

328
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,530
I am going to kill that old man

329
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:43,701
With my bare hands
and my teeth.

330
00:16:48,975 --> 00:16:51,108
I'll be holding
your shoes.

331
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:59,116
I just wish
that penguin was still alive.

332
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:03,087
I didn't make that little punk

333
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:07,024
Suffer near badly enough.

334
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:18,269
Excuse me, sir?

335
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:19,737
Uh...

336
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:26,110
I couldn't help but notice
the sign on your trailer.

337
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:27,545
Is it still for rent?

338
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,447
100 bucks a week.
It ain't much, but...

339
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:31,782
I'll take it.
You don't want to
look at it first?

340
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,417
No, i'm not fussy.

341
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,419
It's all yours.

342
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:37,855
The key?

343
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:41,359
Hey, sweet truck. You got
that big hemi in there?

344
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:44,028
Yes. Yup.

345
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,097
That big hemi's in there.

346
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:47,898
Somewhere.

347
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,568
Uh, sir, the key?

348
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,636
It's in the door.

349
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:55,072
Okay.

350
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:07,985
What's up, players?

351
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:09,387
You got any smokes?

352
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:12,656
No.

353
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:18,996
Where are we?

354
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:22,133
Damn if i know.

355
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:30,374
I think we're dead.

356
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:42,686
Harvey.

357
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:44,789
Jim. How marvelous.

358
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,558
You still mad at us?

359
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,560
No. Please.

360
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:51,695
I'm quite fond
of you, and...

361
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:53,998
You intrigue me.

362
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,768
I knew i'd regret killing you
as soon as i gave the word.

363
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:00,838
But you know me.
I'm feisty.

364
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,239
What do you know about

365
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:04,675
A man and a woman abducting
street kids on your turf?

366
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:06,911
No foreplay with you, hmm?

367
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:10,648
Figures, but you got
with the program.

368
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,517
Killed penguin
your own bad self.

369
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:14,919
I was surprised.

370
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:16,754
Straight arrow like you.

371
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:19,590
I guess you misjudged me.
I guess i did.

372
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:22,359
You're just a little sinner
like the rest of us.

373
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:24,962
I'm almost

374
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:27,531
Kind of sad about that.

375
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:30,000
We're looking for a man
and a woman,

376
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,702
Middle-aged,

377
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:33,170
White,

378
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,939
Targeting children under 16.

379
00:19:34,941 --> 00:19:37,842
They use a poisoned pin,
if you can believe it.

380
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:41,712
Oh. Used to be there was only a
market for nice-looking girls.

381
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:43,714
That's what i said.

382
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:45,716
But now there's a
new buyer overseas

383
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:47,952
That will take anyone
young and healthy.

384
00:19:47,954 --> 00:19:49,820
Overseas where? Who's "they"?

385
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:51,322
Nobody knows.

386
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:52,623
What do they want 'em for?

387
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:53,991
Nobody knows.

388
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:57,862
And no one<i> cares</i> to know.

389
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:05,970
Ta-da! Moo shu.

390
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:07,972
Sorry. Go on.

391
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:09,707
They drug them
with a big pin?

392
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,175
That is so creepy.

393
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:13,644
No, you don't want to hear
this stuff. It's depressing.

394
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:15,813
What do they use them
for? The children?

395
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:18,082
Nobody seems to know.

396
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:20,985
And we can't say a damn thing
to the press. Bad pr.

397
00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:22,987
I can't believe the
system is so corrupt.

398
00:20:22,989 --> 00:20:25,789
You have no idea.
What do you mean?

399
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:31,362
No. You know,
figure of speech, i guess.

400
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:33,731
Did something happen that
you're not telling me about?

401
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,499
These last couple of weeks...

402
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:38,435
You've been different, troubled.

403
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:40,738
Hmm.

404
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,740
No.

405
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,142
Been having trouble sleeping,
i guess.

406
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:50,147
The newspapers must get
anonymous tips all the time.

407
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:52,149
Oh, sure, yeah.

408
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:54,618
You mean, call it in myself?

409
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:58,122
No, i can't do that.

410
00:21:05,164 --> 00:21:06,797
<i>Gotham gazette.</i>
The newsroom.

411
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,699
Wait. No.

412
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:10,434
Hi. Listen,
i can't talk long.

413
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:12,536
Somebody is abducting homeless
children off the streets,

414
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:14,505
And the cops are trying
to keep it quiet.

415
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:17,508
Go talk to captain sarah essen
of the gcpd. She has got a kid

416
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:20,010
In custody who can tell you
the whole story.

417
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:21,745
End the call.
I got to go.

418
00:21:23,983 --> 00:21:25,316
Listen to me, barbara.

419
00:21:25,318 --> 00:21:27,351
When i tell you stuff,
that's just between us.

420
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:28,786
You can't do that,
what you just did.

421
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,321
But it was the right thing
to do.

422
00:21:30,323 --> 00:21:32,256
That's not the point.
Well, what is the point?

423
00:21:33,726 --> 00:21:34,892
You're right.

424
00:21:34,894 --> 00:21:37,494
It was the right
thing to do.

425
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:38,896
Don't do it again, okay?

426
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:40,998
Yes, boss.

427
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:44,902
"gotham spirals ever downward."

428
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:46,503
"mayor james under attack."

429
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:49,239
"vows swift action."
"points finger

430
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:52,810
At police department's
sluggish response." et cetera.

431
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:53,877
It's just ink.

432
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:55,245
Did you give them this?

433
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:56,547
Me?

434
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:57,915
You've done it before.

435
00:21:57,917 --> 00:21:59,750
On my own case? Never.

436
00:21:59,752 --> 00:22:01,785
Be a very stupid thing to do.

437
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:03,120
Jim?

438
00:22:04,223 --> 00:22:05,623
I didn't call it in.

439
00:22:06,726 --> 00:22:07,925
I swear.

440
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:09,259
Another mystery.

441
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:10,961
We have a thin
lead on the case,

442
00:22:10,963 --> 00:22:12,463
If you'd like to hear it, ma'am.

443
00:22:12,465 --> 00:22:13,964
There's only
three companies

444
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:15,766
In gotham that stock
this atp stuff,

445
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:18,135
And you need a special
license to buy it.

446
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:19,770
Chances are, one of
the three's crooked.

447
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:21,505
We're looking to lean hard
on all three,

448
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,007
Like they are crooked,

449
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:25,075
See which one pops.

450
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,320
That was sneaky good.

451
00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:38,088
Almost couldn't tell
you were lying.

452
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,456
I wasn't lying.

453
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,292
Good morning, judge baker.

454
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:44,294
Thank you, sir.
Yes, all three.

455
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:45,496
Welzyne,

456
00:22:45,498 --> 00:22:47,998
Dracotech and
quillan pharma.

457
00:22:52,772 --> 00:22:55,539
<i>You guys have screwed me.</i>

458
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,541
Against my better judgment,

459
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,209
I sell you the juice,

460
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,779
I let you guys
use my storage space

461
00:23:01,781 --> 00:23:04,448
Because, "no problem," you said.

462
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,150
And now look.

463
00:23:06,152 --> 00:23:07,451
Heat.

464
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:08,886
White-hot heat.

465
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:10,788
No problems, my friend.

466
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,456
We're here
to take the merch away.

467
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:14,191
You'll be clean as a whistle.

468
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:16,160
Merch?

469
00:23:16,162 --> 00:23:17,728
They're children, damn it.

470
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,763
They're
human beings.

471
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:21,965
Didn't i tell you to check
on them ten minutes ago?

472
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:27,104
I want another five large.

473
00:23:27,106 --> 00:23:28,572
But we had a
deal already.

474
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,607
I got to stand up
for what is right here.

475
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:33,577
Be fair, sir. We don't have
that kind of cash on hand.

476
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,913
That's your problem. I can wait.

477
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:37,948
I thought you was
worried about the heat.

478
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,917
Well, if heat arrives
in the meantime,

479
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,653
I can get rid of the
evidence very quickly.

480
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:44,254
We have an obligation
to deliver.

481
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,557
The dollmaker doesn't
tolerate failure.

482
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:47,591
We need those children.

483
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,593
Well, that's also your problem.

484
00:23:56,068 --> 00:23:59,837
No. Hey, hey, this
is totally inappropriate.

485
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:02,506
I mean, we were having
a business discussion here.

486
00:24:02,508 --> 00:24:04,274
You weren't being fair.

487
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:10,914
Oh, gosh. Cops.

488
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:15,719
You didn't call the
<i>gazette,</i> but did your girl

489
00:24:15,721 --> 00:24:17,688
Call the<i> gazette?</i>
Yeah.

490
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:20,257
I knew it.
I didn't know
she was gonna call 'em.

491
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:22,392
Seriously, you got to learn
to control your woman.

492
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:24,194
I kind of like her
the way she is.

493
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:25,729
No, these high-class
temperamental broads...

494
00:24:25,731 --> 00:24:27,598
They need firm handling.
Trust me.

495
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,933
Trust you? On women?
Damn right.

496
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:32,336
All varieties.
From hausfraus to movie stars.

497
00:24:32,338 --> 00:24:35,706
I love 'em all.
Now, you? Let me guess.

498
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:38,108
High school sweetheart.
Then a bunch of hos overseas

499
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,877
Only made you sad,

500
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:41,445
And then there's barbara.

501
00:24:41,447 --> 00:24:42,913
Pretty much.

502
00:24:42,915 --> 00:24:45,582
You, my friend, are a monkey

503
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:47,117
Riding a racehorse.

504
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:57,795
Good evening.
May i help you?

505
00:24:57,797 --> 00:24:59,596
Detectives gordon and bullock.
We need to speak

506
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:01,632
To whoever's
in charge here, ma'am.
Of course.

507
00:25:01,634 --> 00:25:04,268
Mr. Quillan, detectives
are here to see you.

508
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,702
Oh?

509
00:25:07,106 --> 00:25:08,839
Oh, wow.

510
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:10,607
Detectives.
Hey, what's up?

511
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:12,142
Nothing serious,
i hope.

512
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:14,912
Cut the crap. We have a warrant
to search the premises.

513
00:25:14,914 --> 00:25:16,213
We know what you're doing.

514
00:25:16,215 --> 00:25:18,148
Well, then, you know
some boring stuff, then.

515
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,883
I mean, what are you
talking about?

516
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:23,053
You're peddling atp
to those kid snatchers.

517
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:25,222
Oh, my gosh, no.
I-i mean,

518
00:25:25,224 --> 00:25:27,691
We used to stock atp,
but not since

519
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:29,860
The arkham asylum closed.

520
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:32,830
Uh, uh... I heard that
the wayne foundation

521
00:25:32,832 --> 00:25:34,832
Is planning on reopening

522
00:25:34,834 --> 00:25:36,567
The old place again.

523
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:38,068
But now that
the waynes are dead,

524
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,003
I guess everything's
up in the air.

525
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:41,505
Uh...

526
00:25:41,507 --> 00:25:43,006
What a world, eh?

527
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:44,775
Nobody's safe.

528
00:25:58,324 --> 00:26:00,557
Jim!
Go, go!

529
00:26:12,605 --> 00:26:14,404
Where the hell were you?

530
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,073
Get rid of 'em now.

531
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:18,342
And hose down the room.

532
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:31,521
Zeb.

533
00:26:32,358 --> 00:26:33,657
Freeze.

534
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:50,540
On behalf of all
the citizens of gotham,

535
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:51,942
I want to thank
you brave gentlemen

536
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:55,045
From the bottom of my heart,
and i want to promise you kids...

537
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:57,147
We will take
care of you

538
00:26:57,149 --> 00:26:59,516
As if you were
our own children.

539
00:26:59,518 --> 00:27:01,218
But here's the thing.

540
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:04,922
The people who victimized
these kids are still out there.

541
00:27:04,924 --> 00:27:07,524
And hundreds
of vulnerable youngsters

542
00:27:07,526 --> 00:27:09,726
Are still living rough
on our streets.

543
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:12,896
<i>Alone, unprotected,</i>

544
00:27:12,898 --> 00:27:14,197
<i>And let's face it,</i>

545
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:17,067
<i>That's the real crime here.
So what are we</i>

546
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:18,869
Going to do to help these kids?

547
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:21,772
<i>Yesterday i made a phone call</i>

548
00:27:21,774 --> 00:27:24,408
<i>To juvenile services
and the gcpd</i>

549
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:27,077
<i>To initiate a humane
but tough-love program</i>

550
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:30,113
<i>To get these kids
off the streets</i>

551
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:31,615
And into the loving arms

552
00:27:31,617 --> 00:27:33,517
Of juvenile services.

553
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:38,422
I think that went very well.

554
00:27:38,424 --> 00:27:40,057
I think so.

555
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:42,492
A small toast,
your honor?

556
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:43,660
You read my mind.

557
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,796
Mr. Mayor.

558
00:27:45,798 --> 00:27:47,331
Uh, where are you sending

559
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:49,066
All the children
that get rounded up?

560
00:27:49,068 --> 00:27:51,868
Foster homes for the cute,
undamaged ones.

561
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,236
Upstate for the rest.

562
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:54,671
Upstate?

563
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,807
The alpena youth
corrections facility.

564
00:27:56,809 --> 00:27:58,141
A fine institute.

565
00:27:58,143 --> 00:27:59,876
Prison, in other words.

566
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:00,978
Forgive me,

567
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,112
Your honor.

568
00:28:02,114 --> 00:28:04,181
Detective gordon's
our house firebrand.

569
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:05,649
No, no, no,
th-that's okay.

570
00:28:05,651 --> 00:28:08,051
Jim... May i call you jim?

571
00:28:09,288 --> 00:28:11,355
Half the petty crime
in the city

572
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:13,023
Is homeless kids.

573
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:14,624
They need structure.

574
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:16,259
People who care
for them.

575
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:19,196
For the greater good of gotham
and for the children. You see?

576
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:21,431
I see you're using
the child snatchers

577
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:23,567
As a pretext
to lock up children

578
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:25,435
Without a trial.

579
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:29,606
Thank you, my friend.

580
00:28:29,608 --> 00:28:31,341
Valuable input.

581
00:28:31,343 --> 00:28:33,243
Most refreshing.

582
00:28:33,245 --> 00:28:34,711
<i>L'chaim.</i>

583
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:39,916
Yo, gordon.

584
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:42,052
Man's been waiting
for you upstairs.

585
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,160
Mr. Pennyworth.

586
00:28:50,162 --> 00:28:53,330
Alfred, please.

587
00:28:53,332 --> 00:28:54,664
It's bedlam, isn't it?

588
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:56,733
Rough job you got.

589
00:28:58,504 --> 00:28:59,870
Best job in the world.

590
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:03,106
I wonder if it
might be convenient

591
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:05,475
For you to visit us tomorrow.

592
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:06,843
Of course.

593
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:08,311
Why? Is something wrong?

594
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:09,546
I don't know.

595
00:29:09,548 --> 00:29:12,349
Never had a child before.

596
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:13,683
Nor me.

597
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:15,652
The boy respects you.

598
00:29:16,989 --> 00:29:19,556
Teatime, shall we say?

599
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:22,759
Teatime.

600
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,021
Name.

601
00:29:51,023 --> 00:29:53,323
Ma'am, there's
been a mistake.

602
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:54,925
I'm not meant to go upstate.
I need to talk

603
00:29:54,927 --> 00:29:56,326
To james gordon.
He's a cop.

604
00:29:56,328 --> 00:29:58,295
You'll be allowed a phone
call when you get upstate.

605
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:00,764
Name.
I need to talk to him now.

606
00:30:00,766 --> 00:30:03,500
He'll thank you for it.
Not happening. Name.

607
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:05,001
Bite me, pigarina.

608
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:07,237
Jane doe.

609
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,160
Hey.

610
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:31,561
Relax, kid.

611
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:32,596
Juvie's not so bad.

612
00:30:32,598 --> 00:30:34,364
First week,

613
00:30:34,366 --> 00:30:35,899
Whatever you do,

614
00:30:35,901 --> 00:30:38,735
Don't make friends
with anyone that's friendly.

615
00:30:38,737 --> 00:30:41,438
When you get into a fight,
go for their eyes.

616
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,841
Hiya, kids. How you doing?

617
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,109
Are you ready
to go on

618
00:30:46,111 --> 00:30:47,344
A big adventure?

619
00:30:49,148 --> 00:30:50,280
Sit down, young lady.

620
00:30:50,282 --> 00:30:54,184
I said sit down.

621
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,254
Like now.

622
00:31:02,995 --> 00:31:04,628
Okay.

623
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:07,497
Next naughty child to stand up

624
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:10,700
Gets a black mark right here.

625
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:24,581
One or two or three...
i could explain that.

626
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:25,749
But a busload...

627
00:31:25,751 --> 00:31:28,018
A whole busload
of the little bastards...

628
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,319
What am i supposed to say?

629
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:32,022
Oops? Just tell me
it wasn't them, i'm begging you.

630
00:31:32,024 --> 00:31:34,124
Just tell me it wasn't
the snatchers.

631
00:31:34,126 --> 00:31:37,093
Bus driver was a man,
guard was a woman.

632
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:38,395
It could be them.

633
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:41,264
You're killing me.
You're killing me.

634
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:43,266
We're working it, your honor.

635
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:47,971
Look, i told you everything
i know. I told you.

636
00:31:47,973 --> 00:31:49,239
Now, you see that man there?

637
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:51,174
He doesn't like it when
i beat people, but for you,

638
00:31:51,176 --> 00:31:53,577
He's got no objection.
Why is that?

639
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:56,947
Math. The lives of 30 children
versus one scumbag.

640
00:31:56,949 --> 00:31:58,815
So i can beat you
like a bongo drum

641
00:31:58,817 --> 00:32:00,283
And saint jim here
won't intervene.

642
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:01,518
Give us something.

643
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,820
Okay, okay, look...

644
00:32:03,822 --> 00:32:05,655
The truck.
You know, when they came to

645
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:07,190
Pick up the last
bunch of kids.

646
00:32:07,192 --> 00:32:09,259
On the side of it,
there was a-a picture.

647
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:10,460
Like a logo.

648
00:32:10,462 --> 00:32:11,661
I-i didn't want to say before

649
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:13,163
Because it would give
a bad impression.

650
00:32:13,165 --> 00:32:15,131
See, it doesn't reflect,
really, what, you know...

651
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:16,600
What was it?
It has a...

652
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:19,369
A blue plate
and a silver fork.

653
00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:23,039
A plate and a fork?
Yeah, you know,
like, with the...

654
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:24,774
Like a catering company?
Like food?
Well, yeah, like that,

655
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,643
I mean, you know,
but, i mean, that

656
00:32:26,645 --> 00:32:28,278
Doesn't mean... You know.

657
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,813
Doesn't mean what?

658
00:32:29,815 --> 00:32:31,982
Look, i don't know
what they do to them. Aah!

659
00:32:31,984 --> 00:32:34,351
Hey. Hey.

660
00:32:34,353 --> 00:32:38,088
All right, draw the logo.
Uncuff him.

661
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,097
There you go, kids.
Let's go, let's go.
Keep moving.

662
00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:49,432
Come on, come on.
Don't worry.
Everything's gonna be all right.

663
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:50,900
That's right. That's right.
Come on.

664
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:52,869
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.
Come on!

665
00:32:52,871 --> 00:32:55,472
Go.

666
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,810
Funny thing.
By my count,

667
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,246
According to the sheet they
gave us, we're one short.

668
00:33:03,248 --> 00:33:06,583
Me, too. Maybe there's
one on the bus. Hmm.

669
00:33:10,389 --> 00:33:11,588
Shh!

670
00:33:59,471 --> 00:34:01,871
Nope. Weird.

671
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,473
Must be a miscount someplace.

672
00:34:03,475 --> 00:34:05,208
Never mind. We got
more than enough.

673
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,242
We did good.

674
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:08,011
Indeed we did.

675
00:34:08,013 --> 00:34:10,847
The dollmaker
will be so pleased with us.

676
00:34:10,849 --> 00:34:11,915
All right, thanks.

677
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:13,249
Nothing. You?

678
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:15,251
Apparently, there are
no companies

679
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:18,088
In gotham with trucks with a
plate and a fork as their logo.

680
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:20,090
Selling children for food?

681
00:34:20,092 --> 00:34:22,225
Is such a thing even possible?

682
00:34:23,462 --> 00:34:25,628
We've got officers
searching all the trucks

683
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,130
On every bridge and tunnel.

684
00:34:27,132 --> 00:34:29,466
But they had a
three-hour window.

685
00:34:29,468 --> 00:34:31,534
We can only pray they
stayed in the city.

686
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:34,637
If not, they could be any
place on earth by nightfall.

687
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,359
Scum-sucking toads.
- Where are they?!

688
00:34:39,945 --> 00:34:41,778
It's not a blue plate.

689
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,080
It's not a fork, either.
It's a trident.

690
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:47,283
When you stow this
on the ship,

691
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:49,853
Make sure there's plenty of room
for the doors to open.

692
00:34:49,855 --> 00:34:51,020
The ship's crew has...

693
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:52,455
Let me out!

694
00:34:53,892 --> 00:34:56,960
Quiet in there!

695
00:34:59,965 --> 00:35:01,798
Hush.

696
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,633
Hush.

697
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:06,536
My eyes!
She scratched me!

698
00:35:06,538 --> 00:35:07,704
Oh!

699
00:35:07,706 --> 00:35:08,872
Come on, follow me.

700
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,176
Mmm. Let me look.

701
00:35:14,179 --> 00:35:16,179
Hmm. Yeah.

702
00:35:16,181 --> 00:35:18,014
It's nothing. It's a scratch.

703
00:35:18,016 --> 00:35:19,482
We'll get you to the doctor,

704
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:21,384
You'll be right
as rain in no time.

705
00:35:21,386 --> 00:35:23,853
You sure?

706
00:35:25,257 --> 00:35:27,190
What was that?
Hang on.

707
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:15,505
Well...

708
00:36:17,142 --> 00:36:19,542
You are a very naughty
little girl.

709
00:36:26,618 --> 00:36:29,519
Hi. What's your name?

710
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:31,321
Why is that your business?

711
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:35,959
Jim!

712
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:41,931
Where are the kids?

713
00:36:43,235 --> 00:36:44,601
Where are they?!

714
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:51,140
He's not been sleeping.

715
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:53,276
And when he does, he
has these nightmares.

716
00:36:53,278 --> 00:36:55,345
Now he's hurting himself.

717
00:36:55,347 --> 00:36:57,347
Burning himself.

718
00:36:57,349 --> 00:36:59,115
He's cutting.

719
00:36:59,117 --> 00:37:01,251
Is he getting professional help?

720
00:37:01,253 --> 00:37:02,852
Oh, you mean a
psychiatrist?

721
00:37:02,854 --> 00:37:05,188
No, no, he won't have 'em.

722
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,856
No psychiatrists.

723
00:37:06,858 --> 00:37:08,691
That's a rule.

724
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:10,627
You make the rules, don't you?

725
00:37:10,629 --> 00:37:12,328
You're his guardian.

726
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:16,032
Bruce's father gave me
very firm orders was him

727
00:37:16,034 --> 00:37:17,667
And his missus to die.

728
00:37:17,669 --> 00:37:19,035
Now, i will raise

729
00:37:19,037 --> 00:37:21,437
The boy the way
his father told me to raise him.

730
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:24,340
Which is how?

731
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:28,745
Trust him
to choose his own course.

732
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:32,415
He's, after all, a wayne.

733
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:35,585
Sounds like a recipe
for disaster.

734
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:38,955
What do you want me to do?

735
00:37:38,957 --> 00:37:40,657
He wants you
to talk some sense into me.

736
00:37:41,893 --> 00:37:43,760
Haven't i told you
to stop creeping up

737
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:45,562
On people like that before?
It's bloody rude!

738
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:49,999
All right, then, bruce.

739
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:52,235
Talk to me.

740
00:37:52,237 --> 00:37:53,870
I'm perfectly fine.

741
00:37:53,872 --> 00:37:55,738
Alfred's a worrywart.

742
00:37:56,708 --> 00:37:58,641
What did you do to your hand?

743
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,279
I burned it.

744
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,348
Listen to me, bruce.

745
00:38:06,585 --> 00:38:08,651
You've been through
a terrible experience.

746
00:38:10,055 --> 00:38:12,055
Talking to someone
can be very helpful.

747
00:38:12,057 --> 00:38:14,290
You must have seen
terrible things in the war.

748
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:17,460
Does it... Does it help<i> you</i>
to talk about what you saw?

749
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:20,730
Yes. A little.

750
00:38:20,732 --> 00:38:23,232
You're not a very good liar.

751
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:25,234
Bruce, you're hurting yourself.

752
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:27,236
I'm testing myself.

753
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:29,806
Different, but i
appreciate your concern.

754
00:38:35,547 --> 00:38:38,581
I've been following your
adventures in the newspapers.

755
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:41,851
I feel very sorry for
all those poor children.

756
00:38:41,853 --> 00:38:43,886
Me, too.

757
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:46,589
I'll give you some money
to give to them.

758
00:38:46,591 --> 00:38:48,558
I'm afraid
it doesn't work that way, bruce.

759
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,094
What way does it work?

760
00:38:51,096 --> 00:38:53,196
Those children need someone
who cares for them,

761
00:38:53,198 --> 00:38:56,466
Like you have right here.

762
00:38:57,736 --> 00:39:00,003
Money won't buy that.

763
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:02,705
There must be something
i can do.

764
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:05,341
What about clothes?

765
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,477
They all looked awfully ragged.

766
00:39:09,014 --> 00:39:11,147
They did, didn't they?

767
00:39:16,955 --> 00:39:18,955
After all this?

768
00:39:18,957 --> 00:39:20,957
You're sending
us upstate?
Selina...

769
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:23,526
Cat.

770
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:27,196
Cat, even if you didn't have
outstanding warrants, you're 13.

771
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,198
No parents or guardians.

772
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,401
That's not true.
I have a mom.

773
00:39:31,403 --> 00:39:33,770
Says here she's deceased.
That's not true.

774
00:39:33,772 --> 00:39:35,605
She's alive... Someplace.

775
00:39:35,607 --> 00:39:37,607
Be that as it may,

776
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:40,243
We're not allowed
to put you back on the street.

777
00:39:40,245 --> 00:39:43,312
It's for your own
well-being.

778
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:45,048
Have you been there? Upstate?

779
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,749
Yes.
Then you know.

780
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:48,618
You know.

781
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:51,888
Go get detective james gordon.

782
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,623
He works here.

783
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:55,792
Cat...

784
00:39:55,794 --> 00:39:58,594
The police are very busy people.

785
00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:00,596
Go get him...

786
00:40:00,598 --> 00:40:02,598
Or...

787
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,500
I'll say you touched me.

788
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:06,769
Excuse me?

789
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:08,771
James gordon.

790
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:11,107
I'm gonna scream in
about three seconds.

791
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:40,369
Hello.

792
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:43,706
Yes, this is he.

793
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:46,375
Well... I'm looking at your son

794
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:48,177
Right now, and...

795
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:50,246
He doesn't look good.

796
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:54,550
Madam, i assure you, your son
is not trying to trick you.

797
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:56,252
Oh, he will die

798
00:40:56,254 --> 00:40:58,287
A horrible death unless he...

799
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:02,558
No, no. No, really truly,
he isn't joking.

800
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,560
<i>I'm</i> not joking.

801
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:06,462
I will poke his eyeballs

802
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,264
Out, and...

803
00:41:08,266 --> 00:41:10,967
How can you say that?
You saw the video i sent.

804
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:12,435
I'm not lying.

805
00:41:12,437 --> 00:41:13,770
Madam, madam,

806
00:41:13,772 --> 00:41:15,872
C-calm yourself.

807
00:41:15,874 --> 00:41:18,941
If $10,000 is too much,
i'm sure we can...

808
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:21,477
Hello? Hello?

809
00:41:27,185 --> 00:41:29,385
Well, that's disappointing.

810
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:33,189
She didn't believe me.

811
00:41:36,294 --> 00:41:38,561
You must be quite the scamp.

812
00:41:43,134 --> 00:41:45,168
I got it.

813

Those bastards nearly

825
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,562
You're quite a survivor.

826
00:42:12,564 --> 00:42:14,897
You have no idea.

827
00:42:19,938 --> 00:42:21,938
Suppose i had something

828
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:24,574
You really, really wanted.

829
00:42:24,576 --> 00:42:26,876
If i gave it to you,

830
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:28,678
Could you get me out of here?

831
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,979
What do you got?

832
00:42:29,981 --> 00:42:31,814
I've been watching you.

833
00:42:32,784 --> 00:42:34,283
You're a friend of the boy.

834
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:36,319
You're not like the rest
of these crooks.

835
00:42:42,594 --> 00:42:45,728
The boy? Bruce?

836
00:42:47,265 --> 00:42:49,165
What do you mean,
you've been watching me?

837
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:51,934
That mario pepper guy
was a patsy, huh?

838
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:54,303
What makes you say that?

839
00:42:54,305 --> 00:42:56,572
Could you? Could
you get me out?

840
00:42:57,542 --> 00:42:59,575
It's possible.

841
00:43:02,647 --> 00:43:05,114
I saw who really
killed the waynes.

842
00:43:05,116 --> 00:43:07,350
