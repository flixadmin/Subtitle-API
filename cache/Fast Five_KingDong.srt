1
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:36,744
Dominic Toretto.

2
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:42,027
You are hereby sentenced to serve
25 years to life

3
00:00:42,052 --> 00:00:45,588
at the Lompoc Maximum Security 
Prison system

4
00:00:45,613 --> 00:00:48,977
without the possibility of early parole.

5
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,250
Here's what we know so far. This is all the
aftermath of a daring, daylight breakout.

6
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:10,357
There were 26 high-risk inmates
being transferred...

7
00:02:10,392 --> 00:02:13,061
A daring midday breakout where everyone
onboard has been accounted for,

8
00:02:13,086 --> 00:02:14,810
except for one, Dominic Toretto.

9
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,177
Police have just released 
the identity of the man

10
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,238
they believe to have orchestrated
the shocking escape

11
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,991
that amazingly resulted in 
no fatalities this afternoon.

12
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:24,172
He is former federal agent, Brian O'Conner.

13
00:02:24,197 --> 00:02:27,111
A fierce manhunt is underway
for three fugitives tonight.

14
00:02:27,136 --> 00:02:30,019
Multiple federal and local agencies
have joined forces

15
00:02:30,044 --> 00:02:34,922
in the search for Dominic Toretto and his
accomplices Brian O'Conner and Mia Toretto.

16
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:37,829
But despite every eye in the country
looking for them,

17
00:02:37,854 --> 00:02:41,180
where Toretto and O'Conner
are now is anyone's guess.

18
00:03:58,097 --> 00:03:59,639
It's got to be it, right?

19
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:25,057
Let's get out of here.

20
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,482
Whoa, whoa. Easy, friends.

21
00:04:27,507 --> 00:04:28,697
She's with me.

22
00:04:31,486 --> 00:04:32,407
Mia.

23
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:34,099
Vince.

24
00:04:39,542 --> 00:04:40,561
Buster.

25
00:04:42,274 --> 00:04:43,484
Come on.

26
00:04:45,524 --> 00:04:46,774
Dom here yet?

27
00:04:46,799 --> 00:04:48,064
No.

28
00:04:48,141 --> 00:04:50,078
When was the last time you heard from him?

29
00:04:50,483 --> 00:04:53,089
A couple of weeks ago.
Up in Ecuador somewhere.

30
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:56,863
How does it feel?

31
00:04:56,888 --> 00:04:57,847
What's that?

32
00:04:59,252 --> 00:05:01,669
To be on the other side of a wanted poster?

33
00:05:03,774 --> 00:05:05,879
- He will show up.
- Yeah.

34
00:05:12,444 --> 00:05:13,522
Dom's?

35
00:05:15,212 --> 00:05:16,254
Yeah.

36
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:20,874
Time for bed little one.

37
00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:22,491
Can I bring him?

38
00:05:22,628 --> 00:05:23,867
Of course.

39
00:05:24,579 --> 00:05:25,629
Aw.

40
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,717
Good night.

41
00:05:46,784 --> 00:05:48,451
Excuse me, sorry.

42
00:05:54,442 --> 00:05:56,034
Why Rio, Vince?

43
00:05:58,829 --> 00:06:01,644
You mean after
you screwed everything up in LA?

44
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:08,056
Ended up free-falling through
South America, you know,

45
00:06:08,081 --> 00:06:10,526
hitting every hellhole on the way down.

46
00:06:11,358 --> 00:06:13,879
Would have kept on going if not for Rosa.

47
00:06:31,993 --> 00:06:33,382
Does he know?

48
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,990
So, listen.

49
00:06:47,954 --> 00:06:49,802
There is a job coming up.

50
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:52,704
I was hoping Dom was going to be here 
by now,

51
00:06:52,717 --> 00:06:55,492
but this one is clean enough
we can do it without him.

52
00:06:56,724 --> 00:07:01,308
It's a good gig.
Couple of high-end cars, easy targets.

53
00:07:02,184 --> 00:07:05,105
Guy I know is putting together
a team to swipe them.

54
00:07:05,277 --> 00:07:07,620
Just need a few more willing bodies.

55
00:07:07,645 --> 00:07:09,181
I don't know.

56
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,403
Look, the way the car scene is down here,

57
00:07:12,427 --> 00:07:16,736
we can unload them quick and
get top dollar. It's easy money.

58
00:07:17,397 --> 00:07:19,357
And from where I am sitting,

59
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,616
it looks like 
you both could use the payday.

60
00:08:03,829 --> 00:08:05,008
What are you reading?

61
00:08:05,521 --> 00:08:06,646
Travel guide.

62
00:08:07,311 --> 00:08:08,352
Yeah?

63
00:08:12,338 --> 00:08:13,530
Tokyo.

64
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:16,419
Moscow.

65
00:08:20,003 --> 00:08:20,968
Goa.

66
00:08:20,993 --> 00:08:22,890
You want to know what all of these places
have in common?

67
00:08:23,082 --> 00:08:24,082
Huh?

68
00:08:24,989 --> 00:08:26,330
No extradition.

69
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:42,626
Here we go.

70
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:00,993
Excuse me, buddy.

71
00:09:15,599 --> 00:09:16,927
Okay.

72
00:09:40,354 --> 00:09:41,938
Hey, we have found them.

73
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,859
Yeah, second-to-the-last freighter.

74
00:09:54,464 --> 00:09:55,846
What is it?

75
00:09:55,871 --> 00:09:59,034
DEA tags. These cars have been seized.

76
00:10:41,323 --> 00:10:42,707
Look who showed up.

77
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:45,853
God, I am so happy you're okay.

78
00:10:49,197 --> 00:10:50,752
I thought I told you to lay low.

79
00:10:50,787 --> 00:10:53,490
Been running on fumes. Had to make a call.

80
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:56,881
Hey. Quit talking.
We only got the two-minute window.

81
00:10:57,196 --> 00:10:58,699
Let's go, Vince.

82
00:11:00,988 --> 00:11:02,672
I am taking the GT40.

83
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,707
Ladies first.

84
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:47,810
Hey.

85
00:11:49,404 --> 00:11:50,404
Hey.

86
00:11:50,526 --> 00:11:52,623
This car suits me better.

87
00:12:00,236 --> 00:12:01,552
See you, baby.

88
00:12:07,648 --> 00:12:10,648
It's okay...
we're all going to the same place.

89
00:12:10,673 --> 00:12:12,473
We will get the car there.

90
00:12:17,511 --> 00:12:20,346
Change of plans. Wait for my call.

91
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,191
Let's go.

92
00:12:42,364 --> 00:12:43,630
Where is she going?

93
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,314
Where is she going? Hey.

94
00:12:48,219 --> 00:12:49,038
Hey.

95
00:12:54,029 --> 00:12:57,174
We're being robbed!
Whatever happens, don't stop the train!

96
00:12:58,343 --> 00:12:59,900
Go after the girl.

97
00:13:00,668 --> 00:13:01,901
Hurry up.

98
00:13:31,524 --> 00:13:33,625
Access card! Get the access card!

99
00:14:47,002 --> 00:14:48,085
Shit.

100
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,725
Bridge! There is a bridge!

101
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,659
Luggage car is clear.

102
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:39,153
Freeze!

103
00:16:39,887 --> 00:16:40,995
Oh, shit.

104
00:17:11,591 --> 00:17:13,347
You had to make a call, huh?

105
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:15,880
Shitty call, O'Conner.

106
00:17:16,695 --> 00:17:18,000
Shitty call.

107
00:17:38,408 --> 00:17:41,035
You two stirred up 
quite a bit of trouble today.

108
00:17:42,367 --> 00:17:44,132
Three of my men dead.

109
00:17:44,575 --> 00:17:46,809
Three DEA agents along with them.

110
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,742
Of course, this is business
and sometimes things go astray.

111
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:57,935
All I care about is the car.
Tell me where it is, and I will let you go.

112
00:18:00,302 --> 00:18:02,588
This roofing plastic says 
you're full of shit.

113
00:18:04,533 --> 00:18:08,403
I don't know how you guys do business
in your part of the world,

114
00:18:08,428 --> 00:18:09,600
but here in Rio,

115
00:18:09,996 --> 00:18:13,081
I like it when all parties know 
what they're up against.

116
00:18:13,132 --> 00:18:14,605
That's funny.

117
00:18:14,862 --> 00:18:16,983
Because it goes both ways.

118
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,368
You know,

119
00:18:23,193 --> 00:18:25,778
I hear your sister is very beautiful.

120
00:18:27,752 --> 00:18:29,544
Wherever she hides,

121
00:18:31,073 --> 00:18:32,365
I will find her.

122
00:19:18,305 --> 00:19:23,351
The American fugitives killed 
three DEA agents during a train robbery...

123
00:19:23,516 --> 00:19:26,309
...police warn they are armed 
and extremely dangerous.

124
00:19:26,334 --> 00:19:29,847
Anyone with information should contact
law enforcement immediately...

125
00:19:40,432 --> 00:19:41,891
Mia?

126
00:19:42,967 --> 00:19:43,967
Hey.

127
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,957
You okay?

128
00:19:47,982 --> 00:19:49,398
Yeah, you all right?

129
00:19:52,746 --> 00:19:53,788
Hey.

130
00:19:59,383 --> 00:20:00,642
Hey, yeah.

131
00:20:02,354 --> 00:20:03,646
Just like a Toretto.

132
00:20:06,009 --> 00:20:07,009
Where's Vince?

133
00:20:07,589 --> 00:20:08,840
That's a good question.

134
00:20:10,214 --> 00:20:11,762
He will be here.

135
00:20:11,787 --> 00:20:13,157
Guys, we're all over the news.

136
00:20:13,182 --> 00:20:16,346
They're blaming us for the killing
of those DEA agents on the train.

137
00:20:16,662 --> 00:20:19,215
Which means we just jumped
to the top of the wanted list.

138
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,477
The feds have got to show everyone
their agents are off limits,

139
00:20:22,863 --> 00:20:25,223
and they're going to send their best guys.
We got to get out of here.

140
00:20:25,461 --> 00:20:28,020
One thing we know for sure...

141
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:31,649
...is that they wanted this car.

142
00:20:33,364 --> 00:20:34,585
Because something is in it.

143
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:37,895
If we find out what it is, 
we will know what we're up against.

144
00:20:55,573 --> 00:20:58,430
All right, listen up. The men
we're after are professional runners.

145
00:20:58,468 --> 00:21:01,236
They like speed and are guaranteed to
go down the hardest possible way,

146
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:02,844
so make sure you got your funderwear on.

147
00:21:02,869 --> 00:21:05,872
We find them, we take them 
as a team, and we bring them back.

148
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:10,010
And above all else, we don't ever,
ever let them get into cars.

149
00:21:10,406 --> 00:21:13,117
Crime scene is 10 hours old and counting, 
men. Let's go hunting.

150
00:21:16,437 --> 00:21:19,230
Agente Hobbs.
Chief of Police, Joao Alemeida.

151
00:21:19,255 --> 00:21:20,320
Luke.

152
00:21:21,161 --> 00:21:23,022
Sorry to hear about the loss of your men.

153
00:21:23,545 --> 00:21:26,056
Is all this really necessary
to apprehend two men?

154
00:21:26,081 --> 00:21:27,638
Let me tell you something 
about these two men.

155
00:21:27,673 --> 00:21:30,259
One is a former federal officer, 
been in deep cover for five years.

156
00:21:30,284 --> 00:21:32,072
He knows every way
you're going to come for him.

157
00:21:32,188 --> 00:21:35,217
The other one is a professional criminal, 
escaped prison twice,

158
00:21:35,242 --> 00:21:37,998
spent half his life on the run 
avoiding folks like you.

159
00:21:38,023 --> 00:21:40,803
Well, if there's anything
we can do to help the DSS-

160
00:21:40,828 --> 00:21:42,885
Two things. One, I need a translator.

161
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,369
We have plenty in the
public relations department.

162
00:21:44,394 --> 00:21:45,775
Elena Neves.

163
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:48,725
A patrol officer?

164
00:21:48,752 --> 00:21:49,771
You heard me.

165
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:52,251
But why? 
We have many more experienced people.

166
00:21:52,276 --> 00:21:53,705
I like her smile.

167
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:55,929
What's the second thing?

168
00:21:57,547 --> 00:21:59,948
Stay the fuck out of my way.

169
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:12,081
- Brian. 
- Hm?

170
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:15,374
I have something I have to tell you.

171
00:22:15,399 --> 00:22:16,558
God damn.

172
00:22:17,766 --> 00:22:18,849
What a mess.

173
00:22:20,429 --> 00:22:22,096
Where you been, man?

174
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:26,882
You better check that tone.

175
00:22:27,048 --> 00:22:28,827
And you just better answer 
the goddamn question.

176
00:22:28,852 --> 00:22:30,402
Stop it. Both of you.

177
00:22:33,746 --> 00:22:34,959
Where were you, Vince?

178
00:22:36,049 --> 00:22:38,932
Guys all over the favelas asking about you.

179
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:41,668
Couldn't get out of there without
leading them straight to you.

180
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,156
Had to wait them out.

181
00:22:43,181 --> 00:22:44,660
That is such horseshit.

182
00:22:44,685 --> 00:22:46,966
That was your job, 
and those were your guys!

183
00:22:47,306 --> 00:22:48,604
Enough, O'Conner!

184
00:22:48,629 --> 00:22:51,674
If he said he didn't do it,
he didn't do it. Go walk it off.

185
00:23:06,648 --> 00:23:10,194
Look, I would love to expand
my operations into your countries,

186
00:23:10,495 --> 00:23:14,247
but, quite frankly, 
your business methods are too violent.

187
00:23:15,318 --> 00:23:17,202
Let me tell you a true story.

188
00:23:17,817 --> 00:23:22,183
Five hundred years ago, the Portuguese
and the Spanish came here,

189
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:25,702
each trying to get the country
from their natives.

190
00:23:27,943 --> 00:23:32,051
The Spaniards arrived, guns blazing,
determined to prove who was boss.

191
00:23:34,764 --> 00:23:38,058
The natives killed every single Spaniard.

192
00:23:39,865 --> 00:23:43,889
Personally,
I prefer the methods of the Portuguese.

193
00:23:45,473 --> 00:23:49,489
They came bearing gifts.
Mirrors, scissors, trinkets.

194
00:23:50,287 --> 00:23:53,398
Things that the natives
couldn't get on their own,

195
00:23:54,011 --> 00:23:57,188
but to continue receiving them, 
they had to work for the Portuguese.

196
00:23:58,573 --> 00:24:01,510
And that's why all Brazilians
speak Portuguese today.

197
00:24:02,682 --> 00:24:06,394
Now, if you dominate the people 
with violence,

198
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:10,703
they will eventually fight back
because they have nothing to lose.

199
00:24:11,341 --> 00:24:13,390
And that's the key.

200
00:24:13,512 --> 00:24:17,391
I go into the favelas and 
give them something to lose.

201
00:24:18,332 --> 00:24:20,419
Electricity, running water,

202
00:24:20,443 --> 00:24:22,431
school rooms for their kids.

203
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,489
And for that taste of a better life,

204
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:30,008
I own them.

205
00:24:31,733 --> 00:24:32,775
Gentlemen.

206
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:38,596
I apologize for the interruption.

207
00:24:39,157 --> 00:24:41,409
Senor Reyes, may I speak with you?

208
00:24:41,735 --> 00:24:43,292
We have found them.

209
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,208
Pardon me, gentlemen.

210
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,868
Almost wish I didn't see that.

211
00:25:08,237 --> 00:25:09,407
Almost.

212
00:25:10,421 --> 00:25:11,600
Wait, Dom.

213
00:25:12,933 --> 00:25:14,558
Mia was on that train.

214
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:15,826
My sister!

215
00:25:16,898 --> 00:25:19,497
I didn't know!
I wouldn't do anything to hurt her!

216
00:25:19,522 --> 00:25:21,141
You set up the deal!

217
00:25:22,575 --> 00:25:24,827
I thought the job was for the cars.

218
00:25:25,198 --> 00:25:26,914
I didn't know.

219
00:25:26,965 --> 00:25:28,568
All they want is the chip.

220
00:25:30,424 --> 00:25:31,525
Damn!

221
00:25:32,762 --> 00:25:34,618
You should have come clean!

222
00:25:34,643 --> 00:25:36,255
What's going on out here?

223
00:25:36,632 --> 00:25:37,972
Nothing.

224
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:41,789
Please, Dom, just let me have 
the chip. I can take this to them.

225
00:25:42,137 --> 00:25:44,138
They will give it to Reyes 
and set things right.

226
00:25:45,013 --> 00:25:46,096
Get out.

227
00:25:49,191 --> 00:25:50,567
What?

228
00:25:51,093 --> 00:25:52,237
Get out!

229
00:25:59,521 --> 00:26:01,438
You never listen to me.

230
00:26:02,199 --> 00:26:05,791
Not when I told you he was a cop,
and not now.

231
00:26:06,875 --> 00:26:10,781
You never trust me and
look where it's gotten us.

232
00:26:11,257 --> 00:26:13,163
Look at our family now.

233
00:26:13,581 --> 00:26:16,978
I can't go home.
Your sister is stuck in this life.

234
00:26:19,212 --> 00:26:20,592
Where's Letty, Dom?

235
00:26:22,907 --> 00:26:24,094
Where's Letty?

236
00:26:48,129 --> 00:26:49,552
Plasma cutter.

237
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:53,175
Wilkes, I want a list of 
every place within 50 miles

238
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,125
that distributes compressed gas tanks.

239
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:56,845
Pass me that manifest.

240
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:05,800
Officer Neves. Been waiting for you.

241
00:27:06,097 --> 00:27:07,294
You asked for me?

242
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:08,246
I did.

243
00:27:08,437 --> 00:27:09,938
May I ask why?

244
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:12,702
My smile is not that great.

245
00:27:15,953 --> 00:27:18,734
Your husband was an officer 
who was gunned down in the favela.

246
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,923
Six months later,
you upped and joined the force.

247
00:27:20,948 --> 00:27:22,247
You're motivated.

248
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:25,771
Plus, I figure you're the only one in Rio 
who can't be bought.

249
00:27:25,801 --> 00:27:27,028
Am I right?

250
00:27:28,642 --> 00:27:30,330
- Yes. 
- Of course I am.

251
00:27:30,508 --> 00:27:32,127
Good news, bad news.

252
00:27:32,152 --> 00:27:33,869
You know I like my dessert first.

253
00:27:33,894 --> 00:27:35,903
Back-checked the rail line like you asked.

254
00:27:35,928 --> 00:27:38,127
Found a couple of spots
where they unloaded the cars.

255
00:27:38,338 --> 00:27:42,210
One set of tracks headed west until it
hit the main highway, then disappeared.

256
00:27:42,235 --> 00:27:43,931
But another set of tracks headed east.

257
00:27:43,956 --> 00:27:46,416
A 107-inch wheelbase,
eight-and-a-half-inch tread.

258
00:27:46,631 --> 00:27:48,996
The GT40 that was missing 
from the manifest.

259
00:27:49,021 --> 00:27:52,057
Followed the trail a couple of miles.
Pretty easy in this scrub.

260
00:27:52,207 --> 00:27:53,902
Can't move without leaving a sign.

261
00:27:53,927 --> 00:27:55,400
Give me the damn veggies.

262
00:27:55,435 --> 00:27:58,673
The ground rolls into a hardpack
and we lost that track, too.

263
00:27:59,903 --> 00:28:01,404
Not necessarily.

264
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:04,872
That road heads up through the hills 
into the favelas.

265
00:28:04,897 --> 00:28:07,394
Couple of years ago,
it was washed out by a storm.

266
00:28:07,766 --> 00:28:09,937
It's all dirt a mile from where you were.

267
00:28:09,962 --> 00:28:12,417
If they headed that way, 
we will pick up their tracks there.

268
00:28:12,965 --> 00:28:14,459
You come prepared.

269
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,850
I am motivated.

270
00:28:17,843 --> 00:28:18,947
All right, then.

271
00:28:19,309 --> 00:28:21,394
Let's find ourselves a car.

272
00:28:52,327 --> 00:28:53,333
What do you think?

273
00:28:53,358 --> 00:28:55,368
Well, it's definitely a custom chip.

274
00:28:56,177 --> 00:28:58,673
Look at all these side menus here
for data entry.

275
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,722
Let's check this one.

276
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:09,750
Look at that.
Same building, same order every week.

277
00:29:10,027 --> 00:29:11,725
It's a delivery schedule.

278
00:29:33,153 --> 00:29:34,153
What's this?

279
00:29:35,365 --> 00:29:36,330
Drugs?

280
00:29:36,437 --> 00:29:38,883
No. That's a dealer pack.

281
00:29:39,488 --> 00:29:41,571
See, most major players,
they weigh their money,

282
00:29:41,596 --> 00:29:43,470
so they don't have to constantly count it.

283
00:29:43,495 --> 00:29:44,978
Right there, that's 49 kilos.

284
00:29:45,003 --> 00:29:47,047
49 kilos is a million in twenties.

285
00:29:47,564 --> 00:29:50,393
You're saying each one of these shipments
is worth 10 million dollars?

286
00:29:50,418 --> 00:29:51,428
Yeah.

287
00:30:14,367 --> 00:30:16,010
I thought so.

288
00:30:18,528 --> 00:30:19,991
So what is that?

289
00:30:20,065 --> 00:30:22,634
A 100-million plus in cash houses?

290
00:30:22,841 --> 00:30:24,782
That's how he keeps it off the grid.

291
00:30:27,722 --> 00:30:30,192
I think it's safe to say that 
Reyes is smart to want this back.

292
00:30:30,217 --> 00:30:32,851
It's his whole network right there,
just laid out on a chip.

293
00:30:56,451 --> 00:30:59,272
Wilkes, Fusco, up the middle.
Mac, Chato, flank north.

294
00:30:59,297 --> 00:31:00,479
What about me?

295
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:02,215
Stay here.

296
00:31:12,516 --> 00:31:13,754
Go that way.

297
00:31:13,928 --> 00:31:15,437
The other two went over the wall.

298
00:31:58,461 --> 00:31:59,762
Come on, go. Go.

299
00:32:57,578 --> 00:32:59,245
Get on the ground.

300
00:33:00,294 --> 00:33:02,384
I got Toretto. Four blocks north of your...

301
00:33:08,124 --> 00:33:09,916
They already know who you are.

302
00:33:41,733 --> 00:33:42,892
Let's go.

303
00:34:28,629 --> 00:34:30,011
You okay here?

304
00:34:30,036 --> 00:34:33,790
Yeah. I am good. Thank you.

305
00:35:08,711 --> 00:35:11,185
They're going to be looking for
the three of us together now.

306
00:35:11,459 --> 00:35:13,169
We need to split up.

307
00:35:14,301 --> 00:35:17,220
You and Mia head south,
I will lead them away.

308
00:35:17,245 --> 00:35:18,295
No.

309
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:20,415
Dom is right.

310
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,414
Look how lucky we just got.
What happens next time?

311
00:35:22,439 --> 00:35:23,591
We have no choice but to split up.

312
00:35:23,616 --> 00:35:24,801
I am pregnant.

313
00:35:29,653 --> 00:35:31,411
I already lost my family once.

314
00:35:33,169 --> 00:35:35,098
I am not going through that again.

315
00:35:36,077 --> 00:35:37,999
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

316
00:35:43,749 --> 00:35:46,376
I am not going anywhere. Okay?

317
00:35:48,699 --> 00:35:49,782
Dom?

318
00:35:50,911 --> 00:35:52,954
Promise me we stick together.

319
00:36:00,713 --> 00:36:02,047
I promise.

320
00:36:07,027 --> 00:36:09,283
Our family just got bigger.

321
00:36:27,645 --> 00:36:29,298
Something doesn't add up.

322
00:36:29,815 --> 00:36:31,316
Toretto and O'Conner.

323
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,931
They stay when they're supposed to run,
they steal gas then give it away?

324
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,989
Now they're killing federal agents?

325
00:36:39,457 --> 00:36:40,889
It doesn't make any sense.

326
00:36:40,914 --> 00:36:42,547
Here's what makes sense.

327
00:36:47,557 --> 00:36:49,187
All these guys are 
is names on a list.

328
00:36:49,212 --> 00:36:52,743
They come up, we take them down.
Not a phone call more, not a bullet less.

329
00:36:53,299 --> 00:36:55,078
Wilkes, we get anything?

330
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:58,319
Standard forensics.
Shoe prints. Hair and fiber.

331
00:36:58,694 --> 00:36:59,916
Prints are all over the car.

332
00:36:59,941 --> 00:37:01,039
Anything else?

333
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,268
Yeah, we tracked the owner 
off the vehicle ID.

334
00:37:03,293 --> 00:37:05,304
There are a couple of shell companies 
in between,

335
00:37:05,329 --> 00:37:07,561
but we finally traced it back 
to a corporation

336
00:37:07,586 --> 00:37:09,985
owned by an investor down here 
named Hernan Reyes.

337
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:11,540
Investor?

338
00:37:12,522 --> 00:37:15,819
If there's anything illegal
happening in Rio, Reyes is involved.

339
00:37:15,854 --> 00:37:17,494
Okay, then so are we.

340
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,843
If he could get us any closer to our
guys, I want everything on him.

341
00:37:19,868 --> 00:37:21,216
Chato, you're on the roof.

342
00:37:21,261 --> 00:37:23,638
I want you on overwatch in case somebody
comes back for something.

343
00:37:23,663 --> 00:37:26,054
Mac, give me a cross-check on Reyes,
full specs.

344
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:28,363
If he goes to the john, I want to know
how many times he shakes it.

345
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:29,208
You got it, boss.

346
00:37:29,223 --> 00:37:30,334
Wilkes, Fusco.

347
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,556
Let's put all this mess back together.

348
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:37,501
That's going to take a while.

349
00:37:37,526 --> 00:37:38,992
Then you better get started.

350
00:37:39,128 --> 00:37:40,777
They were taking this car apart 
for a reason.

351
00:37:40,802 --> 00:37:42,814
Let's put it back together
and find out what's missing.

352
00:38:10,384 --> 00:38:12,672
Hey, Dom,
what do you remember about your father?

353
00:38:16,285 --> 00:38:17,444
My father.

354
00:38:22,062 --> 00:38:23,570
He used to...

355
00:38:24,894 --> 00:38:27,852
He used to have a barbecue
every Sunday after church.

356
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:30,664
For anybody in the neighborhood.

357
00:38:32,275 --> 00:38:34,651
If you didn't go to church,
you didn't get any barbecue.

358
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,160
Every single day he was in the shop,
and every single night,

359
00:38:40,483 --> 00:38:45,233
he was at the kitchen table with Mia,
helping her with her homework.

360
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:51,771
Even after she went to sleep,
he'd stay up for a few more hours,

361
00:38:52,433 --> 00:38:55,711
so he could learn the next chapter
and help her the next day.

362
00:38:57,722 --> 00:38:59,429
I remember everything about my father.

363
00:39:00,764 --> 00:39:02,056
Everything.

364
00:39:03,643 --> 00:39:04,831
That's just it.

365
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:06,750
I don't remember shit about my dad.

366
00:39:10,538 --> 00:39:13,530
I don't remember him yelling.
I don't remember him smiling.

367
00:39:15,288 --> 00:39:17,831
To be honest with you, I don't even
remember what the hell he looked like.

368
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,968
I don't remember. He just...

369
00:39:24,075 --> 00:39:25,543
He was just never there.

370
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,867
You ain't going to be like that, Brian.

371
00:39:46,478 --> 00:39:48,250
We can't keep running, Dom.

372
00:39:50,218 --> 00:39:53,413
We got to get out.
We got to get out now.

373
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:56,493
You're right.

374
00:40:08,168 --> 00:40:09,836
Here's how we're going to do it.

375
00:40:13,929 --> 00:40:15,237
We're going to use this.

376
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,021
We're going do one last job.

377
00:40:18,674 --> 00:40:21,110
We're going to take all of Reyes' money.

378
00:40:21,276 --> 00:40:22,860
Every dime of it,

379
00:40:23,708 --> 00:40:25,227
and disappear.

380
00:40:29,148 --> 00:40:30,148
Forever.

381
00:40:31,723 --> 00:40:35,382
New passports. New lives with
no more looking over our shoulder.

382
00:40:35,396 --> 00:40:37,113
And we're just going to buy our freedom.

383
00:40:37,138 --> 00:40:38,194
That's right.

384
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:40,482
You realize we're talking about
going up against the most powerful guy

385
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:41,608
in all of Rio?

386
00:40:41,619 --> 00:40:42,877
Yes, we are.

387
00:40:44,353 --> 00:40:46,079
Then we're going to need a team.

388
00:40:53,015 --> 00:40:55,391
Let's run through the bases real quick.
Who do we got?

389
00:40:55,416 --> 00:40:56,841
First we're going to need a chameleon.

390
00:40:58,465 --> 00:41:01,984
Someone who can blend in anywhere.

391
00:41:03,275 --> 00:41:04,338
What else?

392
00:41:04,363 --> 00:41:05,511
A fast talker.

393
00:41:06,135 --> 00:41:08,636
Someone who can bullshit their way
out of anything.

394
00:41:09,229 --> 00:41:10,318
I got that.

395
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:13,614
This guy is going to have
a lot of surveillance.

396
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:15,553
We're going to need someone
who's good with circuits.

397
00:41:17,327 --> 00:41:19,994
And with those circuits,
Reyes is going to have walls.

398
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:22,529
We're going to need guys 
to punch through those walls.

399
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:25,691
What else?

400
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:27,783
Utilities and weapons.

401
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:30,244
Someone who ain't afraid to throw down.

402
00:41:31,438 --> 00:41:33,541
Someone to back up every position.

403
00:41:33,566 --> 00:41:35,157
Yeah, what else do we need?

404
00:41:35,182 --> 00:41:36,857
Most importantly,

405
00:41:37,997 --> 00:41:40,206
we're going to need two precision drivers.

406
00:41:40,494 --> 00:41:42,743
Guys that don't crack under pressure.

407
00:41:43,047 --> 00:41:44,555
Guys that never lose.

408
00:41:45,761 --> 00:41:47,245
You know we got that.

409
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:16,871
Aw, hell, no.

410
00:42:17,855 --> 00:42:20,566
I see they really scraped the bottom
of the barrel, huh?

411
00:42:20,591 --> 00:42:22,997
I guess they did, since your ass is here.

412
00:42:24,672 --> 00:42:27,581
When are you going to give 
Martin Luther King his car back?

413
00:42:27,916 --> 00:42:30,670
As soon as you give 
Rick James his jacket back.

414
00:42:33,762 --> 00:42:35,254
- What's up, man? 
- What's up?

415
00:42:47,305 --> 00:42:48,305
Hmm.

416
00:42:48,907 --> 00:42:50,637
Sexy legs, baby girl.

417
00:42:51,393 --> 00:42:52,809
What time do they open?

418
00:42:53,459 --> 00:42:55,979
They open the same time
as I pull this trigger.

419
00:42:57,605 --> 00:42:59,064
Want me to open them?

420
00:43:02,554 --> 00:43:05,557
I told you the skinny chick had balls.

421
00:43:05,582 --> 00:43:08,065
Looks like 
she started the party without us.

422
00:43:08,588 --> 00:43:11,214
Hey, anybody can talk shit in Spanish, 
homie.

423
00:43:12,181 --> 00:43:14,310
What's this guy saying?

424
00:43:15,138 --> 00:43:17,056
Ugly is still ugly in Spanish 
or in English.

425
00:43:20,058 --> 00:43:21,983
- Who are these clowns, man? 
- Circus clowns.

426
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:27,092
I thought cockfights were illegal 
in Brazil.

427
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:28,992
I see you all have met.

428
00:43:31,097 --> 00:43:33,274
You know when you called me to come to Rio,

429
00:43:33,299 --> 00:43:36,302
I assumed it would be for something
more exciting than this.

430
00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:37,361
Look at this guy.

431
00:43:37,386 --> 00:43:38,444
Long time.

432
00:43:38,468 --> 00:43:39,597
I missed you, man.

433
00:43:39,632 --> 00:43:40,735
Good to see you.

434
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,473
Brother. What's up?

435
00:43:42,498 --> 00:43:44,739
Yo, check this out. This is Tej.

436
00:43:44,764 --> 00:43:46,705
Best circuit man on the East Coast.

437
00:43:46,904 --> 00:43:48,687
And this is my boy, Roman Pearce.

438
00:43:48,767 --> 00:43:51,054
We go way back, I met this guy in juvie.

439
00:43:51,079 --> 00:43:52,819
I pulled that job with him in Miami.

440
00:43:52,844 --> 00:43:54,310
I have heard about you.

441
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:56,515
Nice digs.

442
00:43:57,042 --> 00:43:58,919
Yeah, well, the Ritz was sold out.

443
00:43:59,161 --> 00:44:00,877
So what's this all about, Dom?

444
00:44:00,902 --> 00:44:03,353
Yeah, man, why did you drag us 
halfway around the world?

445
00:44:04,311 --> 00:44:06,153
Because we got a job.

446
00:44:07,314 --> 00:44:09,884
All right,
so our target's name is Hernan Reyes.

447
00:44:09,909 --> 00:44:11,844
And he runs the drug scene down here.

448
00:44:11,869 --> 00:44:14,497
He's never been busted because
he doesn't leave a paper trail.

449
00:44:14,522 --> 00:44:18,728
No paper trail means no banks.
And no banks means cash houses.

450
00:44:18,742 --> 00:44:22,804
That's right. Ten of them, to be exact.
Spread throughout the city.

451
00:44:23,468 --> 00:44:25,386
And we're going to hit them all.

452
00:44:26,903 --> 00:44:27,903
All of them?

453
00:44:28,355 --> 00:44:29,403
All of them.

454
00:44:29,428 --> 00:44:31,025
That sounds crazy.

455
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:35,601
You bring us to a whole other country
so we can rob the dude who runs it?

456
00:44:36,592 --> 00:44:38,218
I thought this was business.

457
00:44:38,591 --> 00:44:39,970
Sounds personal to me.

458
00:44:40,651 --> 00:44:42,241
Is that what this is?

459
00:44:42,546 --> 00:44:46,425
I got love for you all,
but personal ain't good business.

460
00:44:47,823 --> 00:44:49,775
I can't do this, homie.

461
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:55,186
So what we're talking about 
is $100 million.

462
00:44:55,497 --> 00:44:56,925
You say what?

463
00:44:57,758 --> 00:45:01,435
Hundred...
See, sometimes I be over thinking, man,

464
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:04,589
and I know we just met, 
but you just, kind of, got to...

465
00:45:04,614 --> 00:45:07,613
That's right, $100 million,
and everything we take,

466
00:45:08,389 --> 00:45:09,820
we split even.

467
00:45:09,845 --> 00:45:11,722
That's a little over $11 million apiece.

468
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,935
I am down.

469
00:45:14,569 --> 00:45:15,611
I am in.

470
00:45:17,217 --> 00:45:21,856
11 million. Sounds like a whole lot 
of vaginal activity to me.

471
00:45:21,998 --> 00:45:25,624
You can't pull off 10 heists on
the same mark. You just can't.

472
00:45:25,649 --> 00:45:27,378
As soon as we hit the first one,

473
00:45:27,403 --> 00:45:29,818
they're going to do everything
they can to protect the rest.

474
00:45:31,154 --> 00:45:32,390
Exactly.

475
00:46:11,231 --> 00:46:12,356
Nobody move.

476
00:46:27,745 --> 00:46:28,996
That's all of it.

477
00:46:29,021 --> 00:46:31,550
You a dead man. You're all dead men!

478
00:46:32,242 --> 00:46:33,742
You don't have a place to hide.

479
00:46:36,704 --> 00:46:37,913
Who's hiding?

480
00:46:38,188 --> 00:46:40,326
Are you crazy? Are you crazy?

481
00:46:40,503 --> 00:46:43,465
Do you know whose house this is?
Whose money are you stealing?

482
00:46:53,847 --> 00:46:55,264
We ain't stealing it.

483
00:47:04,334 --> 00:47:07,409
You tell your boss exactly who did this.

484
00:47:09,047 --> 00:47:10,548
Tell him there's more coming.

485
00:47:16,221 --> 00:47:17,221
Voila.

486
00:47:18,053 --> 00:47:19,053
Turn it over.

487
00:47:25,362 --> 00:47:28,042
She's running on all eight.
Checks out fine.

488
00:47:31,103 --> 00:47:32,377
Keep looking.

489
00:47:34,866 --> 00:47:37,892
Boss, if something was missing, we'd know.

490
00:48:04,385 --> 00:48:07,652
It's a goddamn shame 
putting bullshit like that on a classic.

491
00:48:08,074 --> 00:48:10,117
You may as well slap neon lights on it.

492
00:48:21,387 --> 00:48:23,069
They took the chip.

493
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:27,281
We got a hit on the police scanner.
Armed robbery at a house in Leblon.

494
00:48:27,306 --> 00:48:30,564
Address cross-checks against property
owned by one of Hernan Reyes' corporations.

495
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:32,871
All right, if that's our guys,
then whatever was on that chip

496
00:48:32,877 --> 00:48:34,580
led them directly to that house.

497
00:48:34,605 --> 00:48:35,855
It's them, for sure.

498
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,127
How do you know that?

499
00:48:37,152 --> 00:48:40,398
Because no one else in Rio 
is stupid enough to rob Reyes.

500
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:55,854
Explain.

501
00:48:56,445 --> 00:48:58,297
They invaded the Leblon house.

502
00:48:58,583 --> 00:48:59,882
Who invaded?

503
00:48:59,907 --> 00:49:01,442
The men from the train.

504
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:12,551
How much did they take?

505
00:49:13,122 --> 00:49:14,664
They didn't take anything.

506
00:49:14,915 --> 00:49:16,189
They burned it.

507
00:49:18,885 --> 00:49:20,434
They burned my money?

508
00:49:20,667 --> 00:49:22,824
Yes. And said there's more coming.

509
00:49:32,088 --> 00:49:32,970
Okay...

510
00:49:41,408 --> 00:49:42,820
Then this...

511
00:49:45,366 --> 00:49:46,824
...is what we're going to do.

512
00:49:53,633 --> 00:49:55,022
Clean the houses.

513
00:49:55,308 --> 00:49:59,361
I want that money under lock and key...

514
00:50:01,165 --> 00:50:03,357
...within an hour. Understand?

515
00:50:06,426 --> 00:50:07,782
Understood.

516
00:50:26,951 --> 00:50:29,187
Number one is on the move, man.

517
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:45,333
Two is on the move.

518
00:51:10,163 --> 00:51:11,323
I got mine.

519
00:51:32,086 --> 00:51:33,792
I got eyes on Five.

520
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:03,594
I know you all said they were consolidating
the money somewhere, but...

521
00:52:04,249 --> 00:52:06,129
...you all ain't going to believe this.

522
00:52:16,924 --> 00:52:19,119
Well, this job just got a lot harder.

523
00:52:20,285 --> 00:52:24,653
If he's moving it into a police station,
he's got some serious brass in his pocket.

524
00:52:24,742 --> 00:52:26,776
This is going to be a shorter trip
than I thought.

525
00:52:26,801 --> 00:52:28,551
Hell, yeah, we can't do this.

526
00:52:28,583 --> 00:52:31,338
"Can't"? You mean, "shouldn't".

527
00:52:32,925 --> 00:52:35,009
I think this doesn't change a thing.

528
00:52:38,263 --> 00:52:40,316
I say we stick to the plan.

529
00:52:40,473 --> 00:52:41,659
You say what?

530
00:52:42,103 --> 00:52:46,004
This just went from Mission: Impossible
to Mission: In-freaking-sanity.

531
00:52:48,209 --> 00:52:49,424
Whatever, man.

532
00:52:49,449 --> 00:52:52,911
I ain't scared, I am just letting you all 
know, going in that building is crazy.

533
00:52:52,936 --> 00:52:54,165
I got this.

534
00:52:57,973 --> 00:52:59,306
What time was the robbery?

535
00:52:59,331 --> 00:53:00,647
Around 11:00.

536
00:53:03,063 --> 00:53:04,272
Here we go.

537
00:53:06,021 --> 00:53:07,521
Enhance it.

538
00:53:09,777 --> 00:53:11,194
Their faces are covered.

539
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:12,579
Run it through FRS.

540
00:53:18,644 --> 00:53:20,342
Well, hello, you son of a bitch.

541
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:25,976
Wilkes. Run the photos of known associates
of Toretto and O'Conner

542
00:53:26,001 --> 00:53:28,893
against customs entries into Brazil 
in the last two weeks.

543
00:53:29,027 --> 00:53:32,167
Check planes, trains, boats, everything
short of the goddamn space shuttle.

544
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:41,161
They can change their names,
but they can't change their faces.

545
00:53:41,836 --> 00:53:43,636
Something big is going down.

546
00:53:45,370 --> 00:53:46,867
That's a 1970 Charger.

547
00:53:46,892 --> 00:53:49,026
Fusco. Upload these specs 
into the database.

548
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:52,154
Have the computer cross-check it with
overhead satellites every 15 minutes,

549
00:53:52,179 --> 00:53:53,499
the van behind it, too.

550
00:53:53,534 --> 00:53:56,370
If these vehicles move in the streets
of Rio, I want to know about it.

551
00:54:05,265 --> 00:54:06,328
Everything okay?

552
00:54:06,363 --> 00:54:07,356
Everything is okay.

553
00:54:07,381 --> 00:54:10,299
Who is this Hobbs? 
This Federal Agent running around town?

554
00:54:10,324 --> 00:54:11,585
Some American cowboy.

555
00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:13,058
He's handled.

556
00:54:13,205 --> 00:54:16,730
He killed 16 of our men. Handle him better.

557
00:54:17,122 --> 00:54:21,682
Look. He requested a rookie patrol officer
as his assistant.

558
00:54:24,919 --> 00:54:26,376
They won't be a problem.

559
00:54:54,971 --> 00:54:56,889
- It's all here? 
- Yes.

560
00:54:58,312 --> 00:55:00,475
What about Toretto and O'Conner?
Where are they?

561
00:55:00,546 --> 00:55:01,546
Nothing yet.

562
00:55:02,422 --> 00:55:04,448
But I have all our officers searching.

563
00:55:04,807 --> 00:55:06,257
Not good enough.

564
00:55:07,072 --> 00:55:08,864
Put a price on their heads.

565
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:12,505
High enough to get every pair of eyes
in the city searching for them.

566
00:55:20,393 --> 00:55:22,803
The beauty of public offices?

567
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:26,893
Public records.

568
00:55:27,154 --> 00:55:29,730
This is where he's keeping the money.
The vault in the evidence room.

569
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:35,187
Um. Uh, yeah. Can I get everyone's
attention, right here, for a second?

570
00:55:35,212 --> 00:55:38,931
We're talking about 
breaking into a police station.

571
00:55:38,956 --> 00:55:42,296
Is anyone listening to those words?
Anybody? Popo?

572
00:55:42,321 --> 00:55:46,371
Five-O. One-time. Pigs.
People we don't like.

573
00:55:46,396 --> 00:55:49,399
You know, police stations are designed
to keep people in, not out.

574
00:55:49,434 --> 00:55:50,942
That's why it's a stealth mission.

575
00:55:51,082 --> 00:55:53,792
We will be in and out before 
they even know we were there.

576
00:55:53,817 --> 00:55:55,506
Well, we will need to get eyes in there.

577
00:55:55,531 --> 00:55:58,219
At least to find out the make
and model of that vault.

578
00:55:58,244 --> 00:56:00,787
So the vault and then, so...

579
00:56:01,707 --> 00:56:03,002
It's crazy.

580
00:56:03,205 --> 00:56:05,531
Who's supposed to do all this?

581
00:56:14,487 --> 00:56:16,145
Wh-What do you mean?

582
00:56:17,544 --> 00:56:18,695
Why me?

583
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,522
Because you got the biggest mouth.

584
00:56:20,606 --> 00:56:22,222
That's for damn sure.

585
00:56:29,176 --> 00:56:30,231
Ooh.

586
00:56:32,198 --> 00:56:33,710
Hello, beautiful.

587
00:56:33,735 --> 00:56:36,411
Look at those dimples. Sexy, sexy.

588
00:56:36,436 --> 00:56:38,750
Love those glasses.
Where did you get them from?

589
00:56:38,775 --> 00:56:40,908
Are those like Gucci frames or something?

590
00:56:41,288 --> 00:56:42,469
No English?

591
00:56:42,494 --> 00:56:45,475
No, no, no. Damn.

592
00:56:45,915 --> 00:56:46,999
How are you, sir?

593
00:56:47,417 --> 00:56:51,114
Special Agent O'Conner. 
US Federal Bureau of Investigation.

594
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:52,498
It says Caucasian.

595
00:56:52,790 --> 00:56:55,542
That's a tan. You know, a tan?

596
00:56:58,521 --> 00:57:02,485
Look, I am working this case and I got
some evidence here to be held.

597
00:57:02,510 --> 00:57:05,146
But I need to get in and check
your storage facility first.

598
00:57:05,313 --> 00:57:06,066
Nope.

599
00:57:06,091 --> 00:57:09,469
Look, I know you're a true professional,
and I respect you, I promise.

600
00:57:09,494 --> 00:57:11,615
You know, it looks like 
you work out a little bit, too.

601
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,831
What do you bench, about 350?

602
00:57:14,169 --> 00:57:15,546
Ah, shit.

603
00:57:16,667 --> 00:57:18,318
Look, I am just trying to do my job, man.

604
00:57:18,343 --> 00:57:21,168
My boss sent me here to just 
make sure that everything was safe.

605
00:57:21,213 --> 00:57:22,227
It will be safe.

606
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:24,389
Let me just come in and take a quick peek.

607
00:57:24,414 --> 00:57:25,238
Nope.

608
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:28,208
Come on, man. Hook a brother up, please?

609
00:57:28,233 --> 00:57:29,886
Nope. And you're not my brother.

610
00:57:29,911 --> 00:57:31,133
Brother from another mother?

611
00:57:31,168 --> 00:57:34,255
Look. No one enters the facility 
but authorized evidence personnel.

612
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:35,721
Now stop wasting my time.

613
00:57:35,746 --> 00:57:37,039
I am going to call the embassy.

614
00:57:37,064 --> 00:57:38,442
No, no, no. No, we're good.

615
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:40,706
We don't need to call them.
For what? We're good.

616
00:57:40,731 --> 00:57:44,446
Here, I got the box. We're all good.
I promise you.

617
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:46,440
Thank you so much for your time.

618
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:48,685
Swear to God, if you were on
the other side of that glass,

619
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:51,135
I'd bust your damn face in.
Now translate that.

620
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:12,706
It's done. See, I think I make 
a better special agent than you ever did.

621
00:58:14,545 --> 00:58:16,838
Well, that depends on 
how you define "special".

622
00:58:19,572 --> 00:58:21,176
Come on, now. Let's see what we got.

623
00:58:21,211 --> 00:58:22,550
Not funny.

624
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:31,748
All right, come on.

625
00:58:36,795 --> 00:58:38,296
Dawg, you still can't drive.

626
00:58:40,005 --> 00:58:42,953
Now, I see why you're always
getting into accidents.

627
00:58:42,978 --> 00:58:45,150
You can't even drive 
a damn remote control car.

628
00:58:45,175 --> 00:58:47,271
I am going to need you 
to shut up right now.

629
00:58:47,296 --> 00:58:49,114
- I am not going to shut up. 
- Shut up.

630
00:58:49,139 --> 00:58:50,922
Strap him in his safety belt, man.

631
00:58:53,942 --> 00:58:55,676
Give me the remote, dawg. Go left.

632
00:58:55,701 --> 00:58:57,911
It looks like something right over
there to the left. What is that?

633
00:58:57,936 --> 00:58:59,168
What is that?

634
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:01,319
Bingo.

635
00:59:02,444 --> 00:59:04,646
What is that, six-by-six?

636
00:59:04,671 --> 00:59:05,873
Eight-by-twelve.

637
00:59:05,898 --> 00:59:07,364
Seven-by-twelve.

638
00:59:07,406 --> 00:59:10,317
Fitted with 18-inch-thick steel
reinforced walls

639
00:59:10,342 --> 00:59:13,971
with a insulated copper core 
to protect against thermal lance.

640
00:59:14,274 --> 00:59:17,784
A Class-3 electronic lock with
a surefire Griffin retumbler

641
00:59:17,809 --> 00:59:19,619
and a biometric palm scanner.

642
00:59:19,644 --> 00:59:21,731
Ten tons of top-of-the-line security.

643
00:59:21,756 --> 00:59:23,866
Do I want to know how you know all that?

644
00:59:23,939 --> 00:59:27,668
I had a life before you knew me, O'Conner.
Let's just leave it at that, all right?

645
00:59:27,809 --> 00:59:29,526
She is a beauty, though, man.

646
00:59:29,551 --> 00:59:31,888
A "beauty" as in "good"?

647
00:59:31,913 --> 00:59:34,715
"Beauty" as in she's going to start off 
playing hard to get.

648
00:59:34,741 --> 00:59:39,078
Then, no matter how much I caress her,
no matter how much I love her,

649
00:59:39,103 --> 00:59:42,405
in the end, she still
ain't going to give up that ass.

650
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:50,682
Two to one says you blow the wrong pipe.

651
00:59:50,707 --> 00:59:53,138
Yo, why you got to be so negative
all the time, man?

652
00:59:53,163 --> 00:59:54,735
I ain't negative.

653
00:59:55,336 --> 00:59:58,708
I am just positive 
you're going to mess it up.

654
00:59:58,733 --> 01:00:01,131
I am telling you, man, you got issues.

655
01:00:06,737 --> 01:00:09,125
Next time if there's no elevator,
I am not coming.

656
01:00:10,745 --> 01:00:13,590
You need to learn to relax, loco.

657
01:00:34,219 --> 01:00:36,896
You better hurry up,
we got less than a minute.

658
01:00:37,676 --> 01:00:42,277
Why do you always set the timer so short?

659
01:01:06,036 --> 01:01:08,062
I hope you know where you're going.

660
01:01:08,095 --> 01:01:10,980
I got this. Relax, man.

661
01:01:11,005 --> 01:01:12,098
Relax.

662
01:01:24,175 --> 01:01:25,801
...a police station.

663
01:01:26,899 --> 01:01:28,316
Relax.

664
01:01:39,471 --> 01:01:41,538
You used too much explosive. Again.

665
01:01:43,462 --> 01:01:47,096
Too much, too little... It's all the same.

666
01:01:47,249 --> 01:01:52,735
That's some Buddha shit you learned from
a book in the prison library, isn't it?

667
01:01:53,627 --> 01:01:57,889
And what you're doing there on the wall...
You got that from the same book, huh?

668
01:01:57,914 --> 01:01:59,509
You're so negative, bro.

669
01:02:26,172 --> 01:02:27,982
Can I have some light?

670
01:02:31,745 --> 01:02:34,086
Got it. We got it.

671
01:02:34,177 --> 01:02:36,100
Yeah, we're looking at four cameras.

672
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:39,661
Yo, that's some high-end shit, too.
Marker optics.

673
01:02:40,227 --> 01:02:42,062
Hundred-degree field-of-view.

674
01:02:42,299 --> 01:02:43,764
Ten seconds oscillation.

675
01:02:43,927 --> 01:02:45,840
Yeah, that's a narrow window, man.

676
01:02:45,865 --> 01:02:47,616
Can't we just tap in and replace the image?

677
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:49,811
No, it's hooked into a digital sync.

678
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:51,939
They would know we were in the system.

679
01:02:51,951 --> 01:02:53,965
The best we can do is peek.

680
01:02:54,135 --> 01:02:56,670
We're going to need some real fast cars 
to get through this.

681
01:02:56,695 --> 01:02:58,203
Not just fast.

682
01:02:58,228 --> 01:03:00,208
You got a hard right and a hairpin.

683
01:03:00,521 --> 01:03:02,467
We're going to need something agile.

684
01:03:02,492 --> 01:03:04,484
You guys mock up a track.

685
01:03:04,509 --> 01:03:05,559
O'Conner.

686
01:03:06,442 --> 01:03:08,111
Let's go get some cars.

687
01:03:08,589 --> 01:03:09,794
Nice.

688
01:03:48,730 --> 01:03:50,821
Home sweet home.

689
01:04:09,191 --> 01:04:10,316
Or that.

690
01:04:11,193 --> 01:04:13,695
How about that?
All motor, no tuning issues.

691
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:15,823
I always wanted one of those.

692
01:04:16,089 --> 01:04:19,691
Held the record on the Avenida 
three years running.

693
01:04:20,322 --> 01:04:21,495
Damn, bro...

694
01:04:22,159 --> 01:04:25,022
You got a lot of balls to bring
your problems here, Toretto.

695
01:04:25,255 --> 01:04:27,748
Not to mention a cop.

696
01:04:28,171 --> 01:04:30,430
Yeah, we can keep that on the low.

697
01:04:30,455 --> 01:04:33,500
Word on the street is a lot of people
are looking for you two.

698
01:04:34,550 --> 01:04:35,550
What?

699
01:04:35,726 --> 01:04:37,435
You didn't think we'd recognize you?

700
01:04:38,923 --> 01:04:40,924
No, we're kind of counting on it.

701
01:04:41,294 --> 01:04:43,811
That little coupe 
may run the streets around here,

702
01:04:45,163 --> 01:04:49,208
but that monster has never seen
a set of tail lights.

703
01:04:49,783 --> 01:04:51,424
- Ever. 
- Well, she's about to.

704
01:04:51,974 --> 01:04:55,262
Dominic Toretto's ride in my garage.

705
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:59,377
Now that... will be a nice trophy.

706
01:05:01,201 --> 01:05:03,723
Let's go, legend.

707
01:05:04,864 --> 01:05:07,280
Car for car.

708
01:05:07,504 --> 01:05:08,974
Car for car?

709
01:05:09,504 --> 01:05:11,364
You want it, come and get it.

710
01:05:16,092 --> 01:05:17,452
Let's see what they got.

711
01:05:24,318 --> 01:05:25,526
Really?

712
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:30,344
Where did you get that from? Papa Smurf?

713
01:05:30,369 --> 01:05:33,341
Okay, O'Conner, give it your best shot.

714
01:05:56,517 --> 01:05:57,559
How was that one?

715
01:05:57,584 --> 01:05:58,779
Camera caught you.

716
01:05:59,038 --> 01:05:59,850
What?

717
01:05:59,874 --> 01:06:01,111
Yeah, it still caught you.

718
01:06:01,136 --> 01:06:03,271
Man, I was milking the hell
out of that thing, too.

719
01:06:03,658 --> 01:06:05,534
We're going to need a faster car.

720
01:06:10,215 --> 01:06:11,965
I want my money. Come on, man.

721
01:06:15,861 --> 01:06:16,861
Yeah.

722
01:06:19,196 --> 01:06:21,072
Let's get it. Watch this.

723
01:06:27,913 --> 01:06:31,031
That's exactly why your ass 
ain't been driving.

724
01:06:43,012 --> 01:06:44,638
I think I am in love.

725
01:06:48,276 --> 01:06:49,742
That was real solid work.

726
01:06:50,191 --> 01:06:52,861
I think Camera 3 still caught you, though.

727
01:06:53,556 --> 01:06:54,814
Let's do it again.

728
01:07:02,333 --> 01:07:04,292
That's the piggy bank you ordered.

729
01:07:04,547 --> 01:07:06,326
- You're kidding me.
- Yep.

730
01:07:08,162 --> 01:07:10,955
Where in the hell
did you all get one of these?

731
01:07:11,665 --> 01:07:13,525
Well, we had a life before you met us.

732
01:07:14,745 --> 01:07:17,594
All right, I will get to work
on the electronic tumbler,

733
01:07:17,619 --> 01:07:20,184
but there's still another problem.

734
01:07:20,915 --> 01:07:22,213
Palm scanner.

735
01:07:22,461 --> 01:07:24,338
And without Reyes' handprint,

736
01:07:24,605 --> 01:07:26,710
Houdini himself couldn't open this bitch.

737
01:07:26,735 --> 01:07:28,806
How do you know it's Reyes' handprint?

738
01:07:28,836 --> 01:07:32,427
You got $100 million in a safe. You going
to put somebody else's handprint on it?

739
01:07:33,363 --> 01:07:35,531
Now there you go with that negativity, man.

740
01:07:35,556 --> 01:07:38,239
That shit is eating you alive.
You check that.

741
01:07:38,274 --> 01:07:40,366
Yo, check that. Shut up.

742
01:07:40,391 --> 01:07:42,388
How are we supposed 
to get Reyes' handprint?

743
01:07:43,705 --> 01:07:44,826
Han.

744
01:07:45,406 --> 01:07:46,491
You're up.

745
01:07:48,422 --> 01:07:51,421
Sure. Nothing like the easy stuff.

746
01:07:52,108 --> 01:07:53,859
Let's go. I will drive.

747
01:08:12,327 --> 01:08:14,328
- I make six bodyguards. 
- Seven.

748
01:08:15,051 --> 01:08:17,891
You think that guy with a fanny pack 
is a tourist?

749
01:08:23,108 --> 01:08:25,168
So, how long were you in the army?

750
01:08:25,766 --> 01:08:28,644
That gun you pulled the other day 
was a Jericho 941.

751
01:08:29,781 --> 01:08:33,523
Thumb-racking the slide?
That was straight-up Mossad.

752
01:08:34,536 --> 01:08:36,579
I got out of the military...

753
01:08:37,826 --> 01:08:40,264
...probably the same time you quit smoking.

754
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:42,848
The amount of chips you eat,

755
01:08:43,507 --> 01:08:46,592
the way you always have to 
keep your hands and mouth busy,

756
01:08:46,627 --> 01:08:49,136
you were a two-pack-a-day man for sure.

757
01:08:51,189 --> 01:08:52,815
Unfiltered.

758
01:08:56,574 --> 01:08:58,059
Well, this is a bust.

759
01:08:58,969 --> 01:09:01,387
We're not going to be able 
to get his fingerprints out here.

760
01:09:02,529 --> 01:09:05,747
We need to do some more recon,
call in a couple of extra guys.

761
01:09:05,772 --> 01:09:09,699
Or you don't send a man 
to do a woman's job.

762
01:10:07,672 --> 01:10:10,125
We're going to figure this out,
I promise you.

763
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:15,202
What's up?

764
01:10:15,623 --> 01:10:17,872
I thought you were more of a thong man.

765
01:10:18,511 --> 01:10:19,894
We got the print.

766
01:10:21,170 --> 01:10:22,462
Where?

767
01:10:24,488 --> 01:10:26,119
Okay, that's crazy.

768
01:10:28,167 --> 01:10:32,562
So, did he just slap that ass 
or did he grab and hold on to it?

769
01:10:35,805 --> 01:10:37,314
Hey, this will work.

770
01:10:38,238 --> 01:10:39,484
I am impressed.

771
01:10:39,489 --> 01:10:40,398
Got it?

772
01:10:40,542 --> 01:10:41,533
Got it.

773
01:10:41,842 --> 01:10:43,635
But you still didn't answer the question.

774
01:10:47,623 --> 01:10:48,715
Oh, no.

775
01:10:49,203 --> 01:10:51,769
Guys, guys! Guys, we have a problem!

776
01:10:51,794 --> 01:10:53,592
The whole team just got burnt!

777
01:10:55,395 --> 01:10:57,081
Now we're all wanted.

778
01:10:59,559 --> 01:11:00,748
How did this happen?

779
01:11:00,773 --> 01:11:04,282
US Diplomatic Security Service
issued the warrants.

780
01:11:04,553 --> 01:11:06,436
Agent L. Hobbs.

781
01:11:06,567 --> 01:11:07,781
Hold on one second.

782
01:11:08,694 --> 01:11:09,735
Hey, Dom.

783
01:11:11,405 --> 01:11:13,197
Is that the guy you saw in the favela?

784
01:11:15,906 --> 01:11:17,032
Yeah.

785
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:20,734
Hobbs is the leader of the elite task force
for the DSS.

786
01:11:21,032 --> 01:11:22,171
So he's good.

787
01:11:22,196 --> 01:11:25,366
When the FBI wants to find somebody,
that's who they call.

788
01:11:25,421 --> 01:11:27,221
Because he never misses his mark.

789
01:11:27,246 --> 01:11:29,868
This guy is Old Testament.

790
01:11:30,311 --> 01:11:33,602
Blood, bullets, wrath of God.
That's his style.

791
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:36,103
And right now he's hunting us?

792
01:11:36,234 --> 01:11:38,149
Dom, we got to move up our timeline.

793
01:11:38,174 --> 01:11:39,313
Yeah, but how?

794
01:11:39,348 --> 01:11:42,397
This thing's already been difficult
without Wyatt Earp on our asses.

795
01:11:42,915 --> 01:11:45,240
If anything, we need more room to breathe.

796
01:11:47,566 --> 01:11:48,941
Roman's right.

797
01:11:51,778 --> 01:11:53,982
Think we need to get some fresh air.

798
01:11:58,088 --> 01:12:00,172
We have got a hit. '70s Charger.

799
01:12:00,197 --> 01:12:01,863
Let's get a move on!

800
01:12:05,568 --> 01:12:08,001
Eastbound on Avenida Atlantica.

801
01:12:08,371 --> 01:12:09,837
Move, move, move, move!

802
01:12:16,094 --> 01:12:17,859
It stopped about a block ahead.

803
01:12:18,318 --> 01:12:19,915
Park it. We're going on foot.

804
01:12:43,274 --> 01:12:44,399
Hey, Toretto.

805
01:12:52,238 --> 01:12:53,863
You're under arrest.

806
01:12:54,290 --> 01:12:55,315
Arrest?

807
01:12:56,635 --> 01:12:58,553
I don't feel like I am under arrest.

808
01:12:59,304 --> 01:13:00,555
How about you, Brian?

809
01:13:00,590 --> 01:13:01,806
No, not a bit.

810
01:13:03,688 --> 01:13:04,982
Not even a little bit.

811
01:13:05,007 --> 01:13:07,343
Just give it a minute. It will sink in.

812
01:13:10,535 --> 01:13:13,244
We didn't kill those feds. That was Reyes.

813
01:13:13,269 --> 01:13:14,575
I don't give a shit.

814
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:17,478
I am just here to bring in two assholes
whose names hit my desk.

815
01:13:17,503 --> 01:13:20,895
Yeah, that sounds like a real hero.

816
01:13:23,688 --> 01:13:25,196
That's funny.

817
01:13:25,637 --> 01:13:28,806
From a guy who took the oath of a cop,
then went against everything it stood for.

818
01:13:29,032 --> 01:13:30,560
Or some wannabe tough guy prick

819
01:13:30,585 --> 01:13:33,045
who beat a man half to death with
a socket wrench.

820
01:13:33,797 --> 01:13:35,171
Yeah, real tough.

821
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:38,747
You turn around and put your hands 
behind your back.

822
01:13:40,281 --> 01:13:41,544
I don't think so.

823
01:13:41,569 --> 01:13:44,125
Your mistake is thinking 
you got a goddamn choice, boy.

824
01:13:48,541 --> 01:13:50,125
And your mistake?

825
01:13:50,705 --> 01:13:52,277
Thinking you're in America.

826
01:13:55,463 --> 01:13:58,260
You're a long way from home.

827
01:14:01,533 --> 01:14:03,171
This is Brazil.

828
01:14:19,259 --> 01:14:21,510
Come on, boss. Another day.

829
01:14:23,046 --> 01:14:25,506
Come on, H, it's a lot of heat.

830
01:14:30,626 --> 01:14:32,630
I will see you soon, Toretto.

831
01:14:34,431 --> 01:14:36,387
I look forward to it, cop.

832
01:15:14,591 --> 01:15:15,486
Yep.

833
01:15:15,581 --> 01:15:17,041
Tracker's on.

834
01:15:18,394 --> 01:15:19,394
Got them.

835
01:16:25,263 --> 01:16:31,016
I don't understand. Why come here?
Why risk it all for $20 worth of silver?

836
01:16:34,811 --> 01:16:36,061
Because it's worth it.

837
01:16:39,707 --> 01:16:41,249
You should run, you know.

838
01:16:42,064 --> 01:16:43,481
Hobbs will find you.

839
01:16:46,217 --> 01:16:49,136
You have every reason to leave.
Why stay?

840
01:16:56,458 --> 01:16:57,941
Why do you?

841
01:17:00,205 --> 01:17:02,271
My husband was a good police officer.

842
01:17:02,937 --> 01:17:04,563
An honest man.

843
01:17:06,022 --> 01:17:07,731
We both grew up here.

844
01:17:08,743 --> 01:17:12,973
Two years ago, he was murdered
in the street, right outside our door.

845
01:17:15,373 --> 01:17:19,352
Reyes owns this favela now.
He gives things to people.

846
01:17:21,566 --> 01:17:23,859
But everything has a price.

847
01:17:26,673 --> 01:17:28,537
The people here need a new start.

848
01:17:28,867 --> 01:17:30,367
They need to be free.

849
01:17:40,245 --> 01:17:43,824
You didn't kill those men in the train,
did you?

850
01:17:48,378 --> 01:17:51,172
Now, why would you believe anything
I would tell you?

851
01:17:58,103 --> 01:17:59,244
Hey.

852
01:18:02,686 --> 01:18:04,395
Was she so special to you?

853
01:18:09,264 --> 01:18:11,598
I never thought
anyone could understand how much.

854
01:18:14,871 --> 01:18:16,246
But you do.

855
01:18:39,818 --> 01:18:40,818
Yeah.

856
01:18:51,785 --> 01:18:53,282
Close, but not enough.

857
01:18:53,588 --> 01:18:55,259
Dom, the window is too small, man.

858
01:18:55,284 --> 01:18:59,121
Only way we're going to beat the cameras
is with invisible cars.

859
01:19:01,833 --> 01:19:04,078
And I know just where to get them.

860
01:19:07,339 --> 01:19:08,631
Let's take a ride, boys.

861
01:19:16,514 --> 01:19:18,213
Don't hurt yourself.

862
01:19:37,176 --> 01:19:39,552
It's been a while since I have been
behind the wheel of one of these.

863
01:19:39,727 --> 01:19:41,755
First time I have ever been 
in the front seat.

864
01:19:49,499 --> 01:19:51,336
Rome, what took you so long?

865
01:19:51,361 --> 01:19:54,616
I thought for sure you'd be showing up with
some chrome spinners or something.

866
01:19:56,610 --> 01:19:57,610
Real funny.

867
01:19:58,778 --> 01:20:02,406
I got $100,000 that says I can take you all
in the next quarter-mile.

868
01:20:02,431 --> 01:20:04,221
Yeah, your broke ass 
has got a hundred grand.

869
01:20:04,298 --> 01:20:06,682
If we pull off this job, I will.

870
01:20:07,011 --> 01:20:08,470
The next two lights.

871
01:20:08,763 --> 01:20:09,929
Hundred thousand.

872
01:20:10,683 --> 01:20:13,691
We don't pull this job off,
we're probably dead anyway.

873
01:20:14,019 --> 01:20:15,677
Let's make it a million.

874
01:20:16,868 --> 01:20:19,371
I like that. All right,
a million-dollar quarter-mile.

875
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:21,982
All right, then.

876
01:20:22,370 --> 01:20:24,913
You only live once. Let's do it.

877
01:20:25,510 --> 01:20:26,729
What do you say, Dom?

878
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:28,639
We talking or we racing?

879
01:20:29,972 --> 01:20:31,408
Just don't cheat this time.

880
01:20:31,881 --> 01:20:33,602
Got to let that go.

881
01:20:53,220 --> 01:20:54,443
Yeah!

882
01:20:57,667 --> 01:20:58,716
Typical, Roman.

883
01:20:58,741 --> 01:21:01,285
I am going to get this money.
I am hungry.

884
01:21:09,586 --> 01:21:11,253
Don't make it too easy for me, boys.

885
01:21:14,090 --> 01:21:15,090
No!

886
01:21:16,269 --> 01:21:17,597
Not this time, Dom.

887
01:21:22,811 --> 01:21:24,361
You got to want it, Brian.

888
01:21:52,993 --> 01:21:56,575
Yeah! Owned you! Owned you!

889
01:22:11,439 --> 01:22:12,921
Good race, O'Conner.

890
01:22:12,945 --> 01:22:14,076
Thanks, Dom.

891
01:22:15,556 --> 01:22:17,771
Do you know how long
I have been waiting for that shit?

892
01:22:18,395 --> 01:22:20,404
I told you he didn't see it.

893
01:22:20,557 --> 01:22:24,546
Your man right there?
He let off the throttle at the line.

894
01:22:24,830 --> 01:22:27,444
You didn't do nothing. He let you win.

895
01:22:28,571 --> 01:22:29,854
Bullshit.

896
01:22:51,930 --> 01:22:54,545
- Vince, what are you doing? 
- Quiet. They have been tracking you.

897
01:23:02,140 --> 01:23:03,722
I know she's here.

898
01:23:06,578 --> 01:23:09,279
Find her. Go. Go. Go.

899
01:23:23,999 --> 01:23:25,506
No, it's okay. Wait.

900
01:23:25,512 --> 01:23:27,926
Reyes' guys were waiting for me 
at the market.

901
01:23:29,601 --> 01:23:31,226
Vince saved my life.

902
01:23:36,394 --> 01:23:37,853
You hungry?

903
01:23:41,168 --> 01:23:42,587
Yeah, sure.

904
01:23:42,901 --> 01:23:43,928
Good.

905
01:23:45,259 --> 01:23:46,795
Because you're saying grace.

906
01:23:49,775 --> 01:23:51,192
Thanks, Vince.

907
01:23:58,173 --> 01:23:59,397
Yo, you burned it.

908
01:23:59,422 --> 01:24:01,695
Yo, this is how my momma does it.
Relax.

909
01:24:02,559 --> 01:24:04,978
Yeah, but your mom is
the worst cook in the world.

910
01:24:05,003 --> 01:24:07,658
Yo, don't you be talking about my momma.

911
01:24:10,109 --> 01:24:12,465
Yeah, come on, baby. Who's good living?

912
01:24:12,490 --> 01:24:14,818
- To you, bro. 
- Cheers, cheers, cheers.

913
01:24:14,870 --> 01:24:17,389
So, we in Brazil. It's the good life.

914
01:24:17,414 --> 01:24:18,197
Yeah.

915
01:24:18,295 --> 01:24:22,039
So, you got a little more than
$10 or $11 million coming.

916
01:24:22,064 --> 01:24:23,320
What you going to do with your money?

917
01:24:23,477 --> 01:24:25,047
- Me? 
- Yeah.

918
01:24:25,072 --> 01:24:28,052
Actually, man, I been thinking about
opening up a garage back home.

919
01:24:28,709 --> 01:24:31,672
Place where people can bring their cars
and not get completely ripped off.

920
01:24:31,707 --> 01:24:32,881
You know what I mean?

921
01:24:32,906 --> 01:24:34,254
- Really? 
- Yeah.

922
01:24:34,385 --> 01:24:37,363
So, your dream is to start a day job?

923
01:24:37,523 --> 01:24:39,478
That's stupid. Like, why would-

924
01:24:39,503 --> 01:24:42,045
No, it's not stupid at all.
I love what I do.

925
01:24:42,070 --> 01:24:43,222
That don't make no sense to me.

926
01:24:43,247 --> 01:24:45,826
I know what I am going to do with my money.

927
01:24:48,179 --> 01:24:50,347
Buying some cooking lessons for my man.

928
01:24:50,446 --> 01:24:54,319
See? See? There you go 
with that negativity, man.

929
01:24:54,354 --> 01:24:56,640
You know me. Money ain't a goddamn thing.

930
01:24:56,777 --> 01:24:59,199
It's going to take a little more than money
to learn how to cook.

931
01:24:59,224 --> 01:25:00,697
That's horrible.

932
01:25:01,013 --> 01:25:04,897
But I heard they was looking for a chef
down at this animal shelter.

933
01:25:04,907 --> 01:25:06,194
You might want to...

934
01:25:06,219 --> 01:25:07,648
I know the manager.

935
01:25:13,121 --> 01:25:14,704
Hey, Dom.

936
01:25:17,404 --> 01:25:18,905
Listen.

937
01:25:19,762 --> 01:25:22,371
I know that you're all
set for this job tomorrow, but...

938
01:25:23,332 --> 01:25:25,133
...if you need an extra man, I could-

939
01:25:25,158 --> 01:25:26,541
You're in.

940
01:25:35,143 --> 01:25:36,806
There's always room for family.

941
01:25:43,333 --> 01:25:44,374
Thank you.

942
01:25:48,598 --> 01:25:49,977
Get something to eat.

943
01:25:51,574 --> 01:25:52,639
Yeah.

944
01:25:55,100 --> 01:25:56,970
Can you believe Mia calls this a curse?

945
01:26:00,614 --> 01:26:02,118
She might be right.

946
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:09,271
You really like doing that stuff, huh?

947
01:26:09,823 --> 01:26:14,177
When your life is on the line,
that's when you learn about yourself.

948
01:26:18,962 --> 01:26:20,540
That's a fair deal.

949
01:26:23,970 --> 01:26:28,313
We're less than 24 hours from 
the biggest celebration of our life.

950
01:26:28,468 --> 01:26:30,707
You all need a refill.
This is serious stuff.

951
01:26:30,732 --> 01:26:32,258
- No, I am good. 
- Cheers, baby.

952
01:26:32,283 --> 01:26:33,928
I am good. No, thank you.

953
01:26:33,953 --> 01:26:35,002
No, she can't.

954
01:26:36,970 --> 01:26:38,852
- What do you mean?
- She can't.

955
01:26:39,330 --> 01:26:41,474
What do you mean she can't?
What is...

956
01:26:46,090 --> 01:26:48,306
Are you serious right now?

957
01:26:48,770 --> 01:26:51,773
Is that the reason you let him
beat you in the quarter-mile?

958
01:26:53,679 --> 01:26:54,915
That was a baby gift.

959
01:26:54,939 --> 01:26:56,372
No, that's messed up.

960
01:26:56,977 --> 01:26:58,610
No, you're not taking that from me.

961
01:26:58,635 --> 01:27:00,275
Wait, wait, hold on a second.

962
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:04,679
So, did he just smack the ass 
or did he grab and hold on to it?

963
01:27:04,995 --> 01:27:06,031
Which one was it?

964
01:27:06,056 --> 01:27:07,689
- Congratulations. 
- Thank you.

965
01:27:09,276 --> 01:27:10,492
How can you keep this a secret?

966
01:27:10,517 --> 01:27:12,595
- Crazy, huh?
- It's your boy.

967
01:27:12,620 --> 01:27:15,654
Why would you keep something
like that away from me?

968
01:27:16,374 --> 01:27:18,166
Baby gift, huh?

969
01:27:18,576 --> 01:27:20,807
I have no idea what they're talking about.

970
01:27:20,831 --> 01:27:21,731
Oh?

971
01:27:21,756 --> 01:27:23,957
What happened to the pull-out method, man?

972
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:27,111
- Toast.
- Toast.

973
01:27:35,986 --> 01:27:39,045
Money will come and go. We know that.

974
01:27:40,309 --> 01:27:43,928
But the most important thing in life 
will always be the people in this room.

975
01:27:45,098 --> 01:27:46,348
Right here.

976
01:27:49,049 --> 01:27:50,090
Right now.

977
01:28:04,681 --> 01:28:06,142
I am all set.

978
01:28:07,378 --> 01:28:09,980
Yo, Santos. Van good?

979
01:28:11,466 --> 01:28:13,675
You know we're always good, bro.

980
01:28:17,468 --> 01:28:21,948
Hobbs is on the other side of the city.
We're not going to get a better window.

981
01:28:22,915 --> 01:28:25,181
Okay, guys, it's show time.

982
01:28:25,322 --> 01:28:26,990
First team in position, let's go.

983
01:28:27,015 --> 01:28:28,315
Come on, let's do this.

984
01:28:40,794 --> 01:28:41,794
Hey, Dom.

985
01:28:43,289 --> 01:28:44,582
I got eyes on Mia.

986
01:28:49,515 --> 01:28:54,905
Moscow, Bali, Goa, Hong Kong.
And what do they all have in common?

987
01:28:55,210 --> 01:28:56,497
No extradition.

988
01:28:58,302 --> 01:29:00,757
We're one hour away 
from the rest of our lives.

989
01:29:01,017 --> 01:29:02,147
Yeah.

990
01:29:04,529 --> 01:29:05,396
Cops!

991
01:29:07,410 --> 01:29:08,455
Come on. Go.

992
01:29:20,849 --> 01:29:22,475
You just made a big mistake.

993
01:29:23,733 --> 01:29:25,650
Took me a while to find that tracking chip.

994
01:29:26,197 --> 01:29:27,749
But not as long to flip the receiver.

995
01:29:27,944 --> 01:29:29,404
You're going down, Toretto.

996
01:29:29,534 --> 01:29:31,033
I am right here.

997
01:30:59,454 --> 01:31:00,169
Dom.

998
01:31:00,199 --> 01:31:01,703
Stand back. I got this.

999
01:31:07,467 --> 01:31:08,578
Pull off!

1000
01:31:08,603 --> 01:31:11,109
Dom! Please, stop!

1001
01:31:17,107 --> 01:31:18,101
Dom!

1002
01:31:27,307 --> 01:31:28,248
Dom!

1003
01:32:31,504 --> 01:32:32,546
Yeah.

1004
01:32:33,367 --> 01:32:35,144
We're coming in now.

1005
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:39,521
Have the marshals meet us at the airport
when we land.

1006
01:32:47,592 --> 01:32:48,718
Ambush!

1007
01:33:06,635 --> 01:33:08,898
Wilkes, suppression fire. Shut them down.

1008
01:33:14,225 --> 01:33:15,684
Stagger-step. Cover me.

1009
01:33:20,883 --> 01:33:21,925
Watch them.

1010
01:33:33,380 --> 01:33:34,429
Cut us loose!

1011
01:33:34,454 --> 01:33:36,539
Come on! Cut us loose!

1012
01:35:34,848 --> 01:35:36,341
- We're good? 
- Yeah, let's go, let's go!

1013
01:36:09,675 --> 01:36:11,043
Hey, Dom.

1014
01:36:17,391 --> 01:36:19,559
You have got to meet my son.

1015
01:36:19,741 --> 01:36:21,030
Nico.

1016
01:36:26,343 --> 01:36:27,802
I will.

1017
01:36:30,706 --> 01:36:32,184
He's a good kid.

1018
01:36:35,723 --> 01:36:38,168
You know, we named him after you.

1019
01:36:40,351 --> 01:36:41,684
"Dominic".

1020
01:36:48,871 --> 01:36:50,872
You have got my word, Vince.

1021
01:36:57,350 --> 01:36:59,434
You were always my brother.

1022
01:37:09,126 --> 01:37:11,360
I got eyes on Nico now.

1023
01:37:22,298 --> 01:37:24,871
We need to move.
We don't have that much time.

1024
01:37:24,896 --> 01:37:26,247
I got us a flight out.

1025
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:28,740
We can leave Rio in the rearview
in the next five hours.

1026
01:37:28,765 --> 01:37:30,499
Not to run away.

1027
01:37:32,026 --> 01:37:33,609
To finish the job.

1028
01:37:34,286 --> 01:37:36,942
Are you crazy, Dom? We can't.

1029
01:37:37,448 --> 01:37:39,032
It's a suicide mission.

1030
01:37:40,013 --> 01:37:41,962
That's your man over there on the table.

1031
01:37:43,122 --> 01:37:44,917
The plan is busted.

1032
01:37:45,441 --> 01:37:48,007
This is bullshit, man.
Reyes knows we're coming.

1033
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:49,239
He's right.

1034
01:37:49,601 --> 01:37:52,147
They tripled the detail 
at the police station.

1035
01:37:52,812 --> 01:37:54,913
It's going to be a wall of gunfire.

1036
01:37:57,274 --> 01:37:59,358
Reyes doesn't get away with this.

1037
01:37:59,813 --> 01:38:01,064
It's a trap, man.

1038
01:38:01,089 --> 01:38:02,305
You know that.

1039
01:38:02,917 --> 01:38:05,252
Dom, listen to them.

1040
01:38:05,824 --> 01:38:08,514
Run, before it's too late. Leave Rio.

1041
01:38:09,938 --> 01:38:11,272
You can be free.

1042
01:38:13,298 --> 01:38:15,125
Running ain't freedom.

1043
01:38:16,904 --> 01:38:18,321
You should know that.

1044
01:38:23,251 --> 01:38:25,669
You know you're all free 
to make your own choices.

1045
01:38:29,708 --> 01:38:30,833
I am in.

1046
01:38:40,456 --> 01:38:42,082
I will ride with you, Toretto.

1047
01:38:45,236 --> 01:38:47,779
At least until we kill that son of a bitch.

1048
01:38:56,268 --> 01:38:57,852
So what's the plan, Dom?

1049
01:38:58,726 --> 01:39:00,769
We can't just go sneaking around anymore.

1050
01:39:02,209 --> 01:39:03,652
We don't sneak.

1051
01:39:04,897 --> 01:39:07,577
The only thing he cares about is his money.

1052
01:39:08,514 --> 01:39:09,847
We pull that,

1053
01:39:10,786 --> 01:39:12,203
we pull him.

1054
01:39:29,176 --> 01:39:30,347
See?

1055
01:39:31,998 --> 01:39:34,606
I called in every cop on our payroll.

1056
01:39:35,979 --> 01:39:37,299
We're covered.

1057
01:39:39,570 --> 01:39:41,696
We have got every entrance covered
with weapons teams.

1058
01:39:41,721 --> 01:39:43,997
God Himself couldn't get at your money 
if He wanted to.

1059
01:39:44,403 --> 01:39:46,741
God isn't my worry.

1060
01:39:58,627 --> 01:39:59,753
You ready?

1061
01:40:02,042 --> 01:40:03,042
I am ready.

1062
01:41:00,694 --> 01:41:01,870
What's happening?

1063
01:41:02,418 --> 01:41:03,746
They're taking the vault.

1064
01:41:03,771 --> 01:41:05,488
- What? 
- The vault.

1065
01:41:14,857 --> 01:41:16,553
Follow me. Quickly.

1066
01:41:22,488 --> 01:41:23,988
Let me through.

1067
01:41:34,184 --> 01:41:35,184
Don't move.

1068
01:41:36,013 --> 01:41:37,200
Stay down.

1069
01:42:07,980 --> 01:42:09,100
Call it out, Mia.

1070
01:42:09,135 --> 01:42:11,038
You have got a straight shot 
for two blocks.

1071
01:42:12,103 --> 01:42:13,604
- Go right. 
- Got it.

1072
01:42:36,131 --> 01:42:37,680
Well, the plan is working.

1073
01:42:37,705 --> 01:42:41,452
You guys have every corrupt cop in Rio
on your tail. You have to move fast.

1074
01:42:42,771 --> 01:42:43,954
What's the best route?

1075
01:42:43,979 --> 01:42:47,183
Okay, keep going straight another half-mile
onto Rua Fonseca,

1076
01:42:47,208 --> 01:42:48,858
and then go left.

1077
01:42:52,985 --> 01:42:54,252
That ain't going to work.

1078
01:42:56,058 --> 01:42:57,641
Spikes ahead, Dom! We got spikes.

1079
01:42:58,012 --> 01:42:59,282
We're going right.

1080
01:43:00,902 --> 01:43:02,313
No, it's too tight, we're not going to fit.

1081
01:43:02,348 --> 01:43:04,015
We have got no choice. Now.

1082
01:43:23,543 --> 01:43:24,601
Shit.

1083
01:43:31,343 --> 01:43:32,600
Holy shit.

1084
01:43:32,635 --> 01:43:35,596
Guys, I am hearing all this chatter.
Did you just take out a bank?

1085
01:43:44,831 --> 01:43:45,850
Two inbound.

1086
01:43:48,068 --> 01:43:49,527
All right, there's an alley
coming up on your left.

1087
01:43:49,552 --> 01:43:50,760
Yeah, I got it.

1088
01:44:44,666 --> 01:44:45,930
You little bastard.

1089
01:45:09,441 --> 01:45:12,151
All right, good job, Dom. Right-hander,
right here, right-hander.

1090
01:45:18,615 --> 01:45:20,657
Guys, there's a big group 
coming at you from the south.

1091
01:45:20,682 --> 01:45:22,524
You have to do something now.

1092
01:45:25,427 --> 01:45:26,468
Hey, go wide.

1093
01:45:59,355 --> 01:46:00,355
Yeah.

1094
01:47:14,034 --> 01:47:15,421
You're all clear on the left.

1095
01:47:15,446 --> 01:47:17,329
Good afternoon, officer.

1096
01:47:19,237 --> 01:47:21,514
License and registration, please.

1097
01:47:28,031 --> 01:47:30,039
Yes! This is big-boy stuff!

1098
01:47:30,881 --> 01:47:32,475
We're clear on the right.

1099
01:47:32,500 --> 01:47:33,584
Oh, man.

1100
01:47:40,383 --> 01:47:41,525
Thanks, guys.

1101
01:47:41,903 --> 01:47:43,028
Any time.

1102
01:47:43,229 --> 01:47:44,778
I will see you on the other side.

1103
01:47:44,803 --> 01:47:48,724
You guys just carved out 
a 10-second window. Make it count.

1104
01:47:55,939 --> 01:47:57,186
Zizi, stay on them.

1105
01:48:23,561 --> 01:48:25,550
They can't outrun us on the bridge.

1106
01:48:27,725 --> 01:48:28,725
Shit.

1107
01:48:35,595 --> 01:48:36,943
They have no way out.

1108
01:48:39,102 --> 01:48:40,102
No!

1109
01:48:40,764 --> 01:48:41,961
There's too many of them.

1110
01:48:41,986 --> 01:48:44,101
Hey, there's too many of them.
We're not going to make it.

1111
01:48:47,617 --> 01:48:48,938
You're right, we aren't.

1112
01:48:50,105 --> 01:48:51,028
You are.

1113
01:48:51,053 --> 01:48:52,523
What are you talking about?

1114
01:48:52,818 --> 01:48:55,064
Just let the vault go. Get out of there.

1115
01:48:55,089 --> 01:48:56,752
You're a father now, Brian.

1116
01:48:56,777 --> 01:48:59,029
No, I am not leaving you.
Now you stick with the plan.

1117
01:48:59,748 --> 01:49:01,238
It was always the plan.

1118
01:49:01,766 --> 01:49:03,023
Take care of Mia.

1119
01:49:03,048 --> 01:49:05,551
Dom, you listen to me now. Okay?

1120
01:49:05,586 --> 01:49:07,469
You cut loose right now.

1121
01:49:24,065 --> 01:49:25,454
Hey, what is he doing?

1122
01:49:29,826 --> 01:49:31,102
We have got him.

1123
01:49:47,659 --> 01:49:49,011
Close down the bridge.

1124
01:50:23,328 --> 01:50:24,703
Do something, asshole!

1125
01:50:36,766 --> 01:50:37,877
Kill him, damn it!

1126
01:50:49,248 --> 01:50:50,707
Kill him now.

1127
01:52:02,356 --> 01:52:04,291
I thought I told you to go on.

1128
01:52:07,028 --> 01:52:08,850
Yeah, I had to make a call.

1129
01:52:26,904 --> 01:52:28,190
Help me.

1130
01:52:30,715 --> 01:52:32,716
That's for my team, you son of a bitch.

1131
01:52:36,991 --> 01:52:38,700
It's a hell of a mess.

1132
01:52:39,092 --> 01:52:40,431
Yeah, it is.

1133
01:52:42,204 --> 01:52:44,166
You know I can't let you two go.

1134
01:52:44,512 --> 01:52:46,096
I ain't made that way.

1135
01:52:48,604 --> 01:52:51,272
The way I see it,
you have earned yourselves 24 hours.

1136
01:52:52,957 --> 01:52:54,222
The money stays, though.

1137
01:52:55,007 --> 01:52:56,926
If I were you, I'd use the time.

1138
01:52:57,668 --> 01:53:00,175
Make peace with 
whatever demons you got left.

1139
01:53:05,166 --> 01:53:07,042
Because come tomorrow,

1140
01:53:08,419 --> 01:53:09,739
I will find you.

1141
01:53:21,468 --> 01:53:22,760
Toretto.

1142
01:53:23,593 --> 01:53:24,885
I will see you soon.

1143
01:53:27,642 --> 01:53:29,153
No, you won't.

1144
01:54:11,128 --> 01:54:12,330
Thanks, guys.

1145
01:54:12,355 --> 01:54:13,940
I will see you on the other side.

1146
01:54:18,624 --> 01:54:22,451
You guys just carved out 
a 10-second window. Make it count.

1147
01:55:05,034 --> 01:55:06,201
Come on, baby.

1148
01:55:06,567 --> 01:55:07,965
Don't be mean.

1149
01:56:23,066 --> 01:56:25,717
"For Rosa and Nico. 
See you soon, Uncle Dom"

1150
01:56:39,127 --> 01:56:41,006
You sure about this?

1151
01:56:42,609 --> 01:56:44,402
You know I am.

1152
01:56:46,426 --> 01:56:48,032
You don't need to do this.

1153
01:56:48,681 --> 01:56:51,175
Just leave me alone.

1154
01:56:51,200 --> 01:56:53,277
Bro, I am not trying to be negative,

1155
01:56:53,305 --> 01:56:56,015
but casinos are the kinds of places made
to take money from guys like you and me.

1156
01:56:56,040 --> 01:56:59,936
When I win here, I am buying you 
a lifetime supply of antidepressants.

1157
01:57:00,129 --> 01:57:03,131
You don't put ten million on red.

1158
01:57:03,156 --> 01:57:04,291
Enough already.

1159
01:57:04,316 --> 01:57:05,776
You put it on black.

1160
01:57:07,577 --> 01:57:08,897
No more bets.

1161
01:57:35,293 --> 01:57:37,077
Right this way, my dear.

1162
01:57:39,690 --> 01:57:41,932
You stay right here, I will be right back.

1163
01:57:43,371 --> 01:57:45,143
So, this is your dream, huh?

1164
01:57:45,444 --> 01:57:46,914
It's enough for me, man.

1165
01:57:46,946 --> 01:57:48,381
I take it that's your dream.

1166
01:57:48,402 --> 01:57:50,041
Absolutely. What up, boy?

1167
01:57:50,065 --> 01:57:51,072
What's going on?

1168
01:57:51,106 --> 01:57:52,906
- You good? 
- Yes, yes.

1169
01:57:52,941 --> 01:57:54,324
You know what's crazy?

1170
01:57:54,340 --> 01:57:57,009
There's only four of those cars
in the whole world.

1171
01:57:57,322 --> 01:57:59,879
Yeah, I got the only one 
in the Western Hemisphere.

1172
01:58:00,282 --> 01:58:04,392
I made a sheikh in Abu Dhabi
an offer he could not refuse.

1173
01:58:04,577 --> 01:58:07,421
Huh. That's a nice lady you got there, too.

1174
01:58:07,436 --> 01:58:08,481
Absolutely.

1175
01:58:08,505 --> 01:58:10,012
What's happening?

1176
01:58:11,325 --> 01:58:13,535
We got to go, man. Let's do this.

1177
01:58:13,810 --> 01:58:15,492
Okay, I will drive.

1178
01:58:15,517 --> 01:58:18,033
In that? Come on, man, no way.

1179
01:58:18,058 --> 01:58:19,972
No, no. Not in this.

1180
01:58:20,565 --> 01:58:21,781
In that.

1181
01:58:28,066 --> 01:58:29,958
Are you serious right now?

1182
01:58:30,274 --> 01:58:31,758
Man, this is crazy.

1183
01:58:31,783 --> 01:58:36,711
Yes, I guess that means there are two
in the Western Hemisphere, huh?

1184
01:58:37,307 --> 01:58:39,642
What's your smart ass got to say now?

1185
01:58:40,219 --> 01:58:43,638
You know what?
We can always shine together, baby.

1186
01:58:43,663 --> 01:58:46,000
Get dressed, man, we got things to do.

1187
01:58:58,368 --> 01:58:59,910
So, where to now?

1188
01:58:59,935 --> 01:59:01,408
I don't know.

1189
01:59:01,614 --> 01:59:03,429
Never been to Madrid.

1190
01:59:04,075 --> 01:59:06,409
I thought you wanted to go to Tokyo.

1191
01:59:06,769 --> 01:59:08,562
We will get there.

1192
01:59:09,158 --> 01:59:10,565
Eventually.

1193
02:00:10,232 --> 02:00:11,605
Nice surprise.

1194
02:00:15,542 --> 02:00:16,888
Crazy, right?

1195
02:00:25,523 --> 02:00:28,274
This is the happiest
I have ever seen my sister.

1196
02:00:29,506 --> 02:00:31,244
It's because we're free.

1197
02:00:44,911 --> 02:00:46,961
You know, I want another shot.

1198
02:00:50,922 --> 02:00:51,922
Yeah?

1199
02:00:53,644 --> 02:00:54,834
Yeah.

1200
02:00:55,520 --> 02:00:59,527
No wagers, nobody else.
Just you and me, once and for all.

1201
02:01:06,883 --> 02:01:09,046
You sure you can handle the disappointment?

1202
02:01:09,608 --> 02:01:10,881
Are you?

1203
02:01:13,073 --> 02:01:17,253
All right, O'Conner.
Let's see what you got.

1204
02:03:45,050 --> 02:03:46,497
You need to look at that.

1205
02:03:50,705 --> 02:03:52,664
Berlin, 3:00 a. m. this morning.

1206
02:03:53,043 --> 02:03:55,836
A team of drivers 
hijacked a military convoy.

1207
02:03:55,983 --> 02:03:57,855
- Toretto? 
- Nope.

1208
02:03:58,848 --> 02:04:00,023
I ain't interested.

1209
02:04:00,048 --> 02:04:02,968
Yes, you are. Keep looking.

1210
02:04:14,251 --> 02:04:16,085
Do you believe in ghosts?
