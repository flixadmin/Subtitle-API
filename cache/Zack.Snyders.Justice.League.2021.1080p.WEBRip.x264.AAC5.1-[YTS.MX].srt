It collected dust

till DoD began to study
the Superman ship.

and 6-1 -9-8-2.

1563
02:13:51,300 --> 02:13:54,200
He understood
they were both alien technologies.

1564
02:13:54,800 --> 02:13:56,400
Different civilizations,

And though the box had slept
for thousands of years,

a theory on how to awaken it.

But in an act of desperation

the researcher harnessed
the power of the Mother Box.
