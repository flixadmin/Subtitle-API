I FOLLOWED HIM.

14

00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:13,735
THE WILDLINGS SERVE
CRUELER GODS THAN YOU OR I.

20
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:19,073
THOSE BOYS
ARE CRASTER'S OFFERINGS.

22
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,202
HE'S MURDERING
HIS OWN CHILDREN.
HE'S A MONSTER.

23
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,371

HAS BEEN THE DIFFERENCE

24

BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH
FOR OUR RANGERS.

25
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,293

WE HAVE OTHER WARS

YOU'RE LEAVING.

I-- I WANTED
TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING.

43
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:58,047

00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,218
- I CAN'T TAKE IT.
- PLEASE.

45
00:05:02,301 --> 00:05:04,137
I WANT YOU TO.

46
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,434
MY MOTHER USED IT
FOR SEWING.

47
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:12,645
SHE'D LET ME SIT
WITH HER IN HER CHAMBER
WHILE SHE SEWED

48

TO IT WHEN HE FOUND OUT.

50
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,616
IT'S THE ONLY THING
I HAVE OF HERS.

51
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,661
SHE GAVE IT TO ME
BEFORE I LEFT FOR THE WALL.

YOU SHOULDN'T
GIVE IT AWAY.

I'M NOT GIVING IT AWAY.

55

I'M GIVING IT TO YOU.

SNIFFING THE DIRT,

71

TASTING BLOOD
IN MY MOUTH WHEN
I'VE MADE A FRESH KILL,

72
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,551
HOWLING.

73
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,054
OLD NAN USED TO
TELL ME STORIES

74
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,181
ABOUT MAGICAL PEOPLE
WHO COULD LIVE

75
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:17,103
INSIDE STAGS,
BIRDS, WOLVES.

76
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,063
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT THEY ARE, BRAN--

77
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,482
- STORIES.
- SO SHE WAS LYING?

78
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:24,944
- THEY DON'T EXIST?
- WELL, THEY MAY HAVE DONE.

79
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:27,488
BUT THEY'RE GONE
FROM THE WORLD

80
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,449

81
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,995
THESE ARE DREAMS, BRAN,

82
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:35,580
NOTHING MORE.

83

THE SAME DREAM.

WHAT ABOUT ALL THE DREAMS
YOU HAD THAT DIDN'T COME TRUE?

88
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,805
HMM?

90
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,810
RIGHT.

00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:05,902
ONLY ONE MAESTER

93
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:09,864
IT SIGNIFIES THAT I HAVE
STUDIED THE HIGHER MYSTERIES.

94
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:14,076
AND ALL WHO STUDY
THESE MYSTERIES TRY
THEIR HAND AT SPELLS.

95
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,995
I WAS NO DIFFERENT.

96
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:18,206
I WAS YOUNG.

97
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:22,752

WISH FOR HIDDEN POWERS

98
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:26,923
TO LIFT HIM OUT OF HIS
DULL LIFE INTO A SPECIAL ONE?

99

FOR ALL MY EFFORTS,

100
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,929

00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:12,309
- SHE'S TIRED FROM HER JOURNEY.
-<i> AT ONCE, YOUR GRACE.</i>

178
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,520
- SHALL I RETURN AFTER?
-<i> THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY.</i>

179
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:17,940
I WOULD PRAY AWHILE.
ALONE.

180
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,318
IF YOU'LL FOLLOW ME,
MY LADY.

181
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:26,949
YOU FOUGHT BRAVELY TODAY,
LADY BRIENNE.

182
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,326
I FOUGHT FOR MY KING.

183
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,037
SOON I'LL FIGHT FOR HIM
ON THE BATTLEFIELD.

184
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,623
DIE FOR HIM
IF I MUST.

185
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:39,003
AND, IF IT PLEASE YOU,
BRIENNE'S ENOUGH.

186
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:41,171
I'M NO LADY.

187
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,330
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

188
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,665
I LIVE HERE.

189
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:20,669
- ARE YOU ANGRY
WITH ME, BROTHER?
- YOU LYING BITCH.

190
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,756
IT'S NOT MY FAULT
YOU DIDN'T RECOGNIZE ME.

191
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,134
RECOGNIZE YOU?
HOW COULD I?

192
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,927
THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU...

193
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,598
YOU LOOKED LIKE
A FAT LITTLE BOY.

194
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:36,477
YOU WERE A FAT
LITTLE BOY, TOO,

195
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,979
BUT I RECOGNIZED YOU.

196
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,439
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

197
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:42,566
I WANTED TO SEE
WHO YOU WERE FIRST.

198
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,568
( laughs )
AND I DID.

199
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:49,740
THE PLANS ARE MADE.
IT'S TIME YOU HEARD THEM.

200
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:52,785
- FATHER.
- FATHER.

201
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:56,205
THE WOLF PUP
HAS GONE SOUTH

202
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:59,667
WITH THE ENTIRETY
OF THE NORTHERN ARMY
AT HIS BACK.

203
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,211
WHILE HE'S TANGLING WITH
THE LION IN THE WESTERLANDS,

204
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,838
THE NORTH IS RIPE
FOR THE TAKING.

205
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:08,550
THE IRONBORN WILL REAVE
AND PILLAGE AS IT WAS
IN THE OLD DAYS

206
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,719
ALL ALONG THE NORTHERN COAST.

207
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,597
WE'LL SPREAD OUR DOMINION
ACROSS THE GREEN LANDS,

208
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,475
<i>SECURING THE NECK</i>
<i>AND EVERYTHING ABOVE.</i>

209
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:19,603
EVERY STRONGHOLD WILL YIELD
TO US ONE BY ONE.

210
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:22,106
WINTERFELL MAY DEFY US
FOR A YEAR, BUT WHAT OF IT?

211
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:24,149
THE REST SHALL BE OURS--

212
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:27,695
FOREST, FIELD AND HALL.

213
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,660
YARA, MY DAUGHTER,
YOU'LL TAKE 30 LONGSHIPS

214
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,578
<i>TO ATTACK DEEPWOOD MOTTE.</i>

215
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,664
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
A CASTLE.

216
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:42,459
AND WHAT'S MY ROLE
IN ALL THIS?

217
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:46,213
YOU'LL TAKE A SHIP
TO RAID THE FISHING VILLAGES
ON THE STONEY SHORE.

218
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,048
A SHIP?

219
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,008
YOU GIVE HER 30
AND I GET ONE?

220
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:53,512
THE SEA BITCH.
WE THOUGHT SHE'D BE
PERFECT FOR YOU.

221
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,683
I'M TO FIGHT FISHERMEN?

222
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:00,185
BE CAREFUL
OF THEIR NETS.

223
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:07,693
FATHER, I FOUGHT
WITH ROBB STARK.
I KNOW HIS MEN.

224
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:09,361
HE WON'T GIVE UP
THE NORTH SO EASILY.

225
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,280
THEY WON'T EVEN KNOW WE'RE
THERE UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE.

226
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,489
WHAT DO YOU
KNOW OF IT, WOMAN?

227
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,366
I'M A PROVEN WARRIOR.

228
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,453
YOUR BROTHERS WERE WARRIORS,
BOTH OF THEM DEAD

229
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:21,123
AT THE HANDS OF THOSE
YOU SEEM SO EAGER TO PROTECT.

230
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,793
I'M NOT PROTECTING ANYONE.

231
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,045
I JUST WONDER
IF IT'S NOT WISER TO WAIT.

232
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:30,799
WHY RISK GOING AGAINST
THE NORTH IF THEY WOULD
BE OUR ALLIES?

233
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,427
RISE UP AGAINST THEM
AND THEY COULD DESTROY US.

234
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,804
BUT IF WE PLEDGE
FEALTY TO THEM,

235
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,890
THEY'LL GIVE US
CASTERLY ROCK.

236
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:40,976
WHAT ARE OUR WORDS?

237
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:42,936
OUR WORDS?

238
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:48,067
- "WE DO NOT SOW."
- "WE DO NOT SOW."

239
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,943
WE ARE IRONBORN.

240
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,738
WE'RE NOT SUBJECTS.
WE'RE NOT SLAVES.

241
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:55,783
WE DO NOT PLOW THE FIELDS
OR TOIL IN THE MINE.

242
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,994
WE TAKE WHAT IS OURS.

243
00:17:59,077 --> 00:18:02,498
YOUR TIME WITH THE WOLVES
HAS MADE YOU WEAK.

244
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,129
YOU ACT AS IF
I VOLUNTEERED TO GO.

245
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:12,090
YOU GAVE ME AWAY,
IF YOU REMEMBER.

246
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,635
THE DAY YOU BENT THE KNEE
TO ROBERT BARATHEON.

247
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:16,678
AFTER HE CRUSHED YOU.

248
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,764
DID YOU TAKE
WHAT WAS YOURS THEN?

249
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,311
YOU GAVE ME AWAY!

250
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,397
YOUR BOY!

251
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,900
YOUR LAST BOY!

252
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:33,737
YOU GAVE ME AWAY
LIKE I WAS SOME DOG
YOU DIDN'T WANT ANYMORE.

253
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:37,032
AND NOW YOU CURSE ME
BECAUSE I'VE COME HOME.

254
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:50,128
YOU'D HAVE OUR FATHER BOW
DOWN TO YOUR OTHER FAMILY?

255
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,714
I HAVE NO OTHER FAMILY.

256
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,634
DON'T YOU?

257
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:58,095
MAKE YOUR CHOICE, THEON,
AND DO IT QUICKLY.

258
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:00,931
OUR SHIPS SAIL
WITH OR WITHOUT YOU.

259
00:19:13,151 --> 00:19:14,903
YOU WON'T LET ME
LEAVE THIS ROOM.

260
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,739
- YOU WON'T LET ME--
- SHH, SHH, KEEP YOUR
VOICE DOWN.

261
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:24,079
WHY?
YOU THINK YOUR FATHER
CAN HEAR ME?

262
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,707
HE'S 300 MILES AWAY!

263
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,542
( sighs )

264
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,753
I DON'T INTEND FOR YOU
TO STAY HERE.

265
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,590
I MIGHT BE ABLE
TO BRING YOU INTO
THE CASTLE KITCHENS.

266
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:38,385
AGAIN, ONLY TEMPORARY.

267
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:40,846
EVERY MAN WHO HAS
TASTED MY COOKING

268
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:42,931
HAS TOLD ME WHAT
A GOOD WHORE I AM.

269
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,933
BUT YOU WOULDN'T
BE A COOK.

270
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,604
YOU'D POSE
AS A SCULLION.

271
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:51,982
SCULLION?
WHAT IS A SCULLION?

272
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:54,484
KITCHEN WENCH.

273
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:57,279
- A KITCHEN WENCH?
- YES, BUT--

274
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:01,366
CLEANING POTS?
IS THAT HOW MY LION
WANTS TO SEE ME?

275
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,286
YOUR LION WANTS
TO SEE YOU ALIVE.

276
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,705
WE'VE COME TO
A DANGEROUS PLACE.

277
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:08,624
MY SISTER WANTS TO HURT ME.

278
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,751
SHE'LL LOOK FOR ANY
WEAKNESS SHE CAN FIND.

279
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:12,669
SHE CAN'T KNOW ABOUT YOU.

280
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,755
I'M THE WEAKNESS?

281
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,340
IT'S A COMPLIMENT,
MY LADY.

282
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:19,968
HOW IS BEING A WEAKNESS
A COMPLIMENT?

283
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:24,723
LANGUAGE CAN BE
A BIT TRICKY HERE.

284
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:28,644
OH, I'M TOO STUPID
TO UNDERSTAND.

285
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,021
THE STUPID FOREIGN GIRL.

286
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,985
I AM NOT
A KITCHEN WENCH.

287
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:04,096
WHEN WILL JOFFREY
AND SANSA BE MARRIED?

288
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:06,765
SOON, DARLING,
WHEN THE WAR IS OVER.

289
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:09,559
MOTHER SAYS I'LL HAVE
A NEW GOWN FOR THE CEREMONY

290
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:12,020
AND ANOTHER FOR THE FEAST.

291
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:15,190
BUT YOURS WILL BE IVORY
SINCE YOU'RE THE BRIDE.

292
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,488
THE PRINCESS
JUST SPOKE TO YOU.

293
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:23,740
PARDON, YOUR GRACE.

294
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,286
I'M SURE YOUR DRESS WILL
BE BEAUTIFUL, MYRCELLA.

295
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:31,915
I'M COUNTING THE DAYS
UNTIL THE FIGHTING IS DONE

296
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:35,919
AND I CAN PLEDGE
MY LOVE TO THE KING
IN SIGHT OF THE GODS.

297
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,800
IS JOFFREY GOING TO KILL
SANSA'S BROTHER?

298
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,014
HE MIGHT.

299
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:52,394
WOULD YOU LIKE THAT?

300
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:55,147
NO.
I DON'T THINK SO.

301
00:21:56,481 --> 00:22:00,027
EVEN IF HE DOES,
SANSA WILL DO HER DUTY.

302
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,822
WON'T YOU, LITTLE DOVE?

303
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:23,425
-<i> ( knocking )</i>
<i>- ( gasps ) COME IN.</i>

304
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:26,136
<i>( door opens )</i>

305
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:28,889
WHO ARE YOU?

306
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:31,808
I'M SHAE, MY LADY.
YOUR NEW HANDMAIDEN.

307
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:35,353
I DIDN'T KNOW I NEEDED
A NEW HANDMAIDEN.

308
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,649
- YOU'RE NOT FROM HERE.
- NO.

309
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,199
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

310
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:49,076
WAITING FOR YOU
TO TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

311
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:51,286
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO TELL
YOU TO DO THINGS.

312
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:53,622
YOU SHOULD JUST DO THEM.

313
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,791
WHAT THINGS?

314
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,793
CHANGE MY LINENS,
WASH MY CLOTHING,

315
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:01,755
SCRUB THE FLOOR,
EMPTY MY CHAMBER POT,
BRUSH MY HAIR.

316
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,807
- NO.
- YOU SAID TO BRUSH--

317
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,726
NOT NOW.

318
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:19,606
YOUR CHAMBER POT
IS EMPTY.

319
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:21,858
CLEAN THE TABLE.

320
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:29,449
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
A HANDMAIDEN BEFORE?

321
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,493
- YES.
- FOR WHOM?

322
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,495
- LADY ZURIFF.
- LADY ZURIFF?

323
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,666
LADY ZURIFF.

324
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:41,378
THERE IS NO LADY ZURIFF
IN THIS CITY.

325
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,171
SHE WASN'T IN
THIS CITY.

326
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,757
WELL, I DON'T KNOW HOW
THEY DID THINGS IN THAT CITY,

327
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:48,802
BUT IN THIS CITY,
HANDMAIDENS WAIT ON LADIES,

328
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:50,178
NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

329
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:53,140
AND I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO ANSWER 1,000 QUESTIONS

330
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:55,725
AND TEACH YOU
HOW TO DO YOUR JOB.

331
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:00,272
DO YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE?

332
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:10,073
JUST BRUSH MY HAIR.

333
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:27,048
OH, THANK THE GODS.

334
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,342
I HAVEN'T HAD
A PROPER SHIT IN SIX DAYS.

335
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:32,846
I'VE ENCOUNTERED THIS
PROBLEM BEFORE, MY LORD.

336
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:36,349
THE STRESSES OF POWER
OFTEN HAVE THIS

337
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:38,310
INSALUBRIOUS EFFECT.

338
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:41,479
TWO DROPS
WITH WATER DAILY.

339
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:43,315
RIGHT. I'M SO GRATEFUL
TO HAVE A MAN

340
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:46,067
OF YOUR VAST KNOWLEDGE
AND WISDOM ON MY SIDE.

341
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,904
- PLEASE.
- THANK YOU, MY LORD.

342
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,827
I CAN TRUST YOU,
PYCELLE, CAN I NOT?

343
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,662
WHY, YES, OF COURSE,
MY LORD.

344
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,873
THESE ARE PERILOUS TIMES.

345
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:02,584
AND THE CROWN MUST FORGE
NEW ALLIANCES.

346
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:06,504
AND THESE ALLIANCES
MUST OFTEN BE SEALED
IN MATRIMONY.

347
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:08,965
MATRIMONY, HUH?

348
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,967
YES.

349
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,094
I'M TRUSTING THE COUNCIL
WITH THESE PLANS,

350
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,971
BUT THE QUEEN MUSTN'T KNOW.

351
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:17,599
WE CAN'T HAVE HER
MEDDLING IN AFFAIRS

352
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:20,185
THAT COULD DETERMINE
THE FUTURE OF THE REALM.
THERE'S TOO MUCH AT STAKE.

353
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:23,146
OH, YES, YES.
INDEED, YES.

354
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:26,483
I SHALL BE SILENT
AS THE GRAVE.

355
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:30,612
I'M BROKERING AN ALLIANCE
WITH HOUSE MARTELL OF DORNE.

356
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,989
PRINCESS MYRCELLA WILL WED
THEIR YOUNGEST SON

357
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,992
WHEN SHE COMES OF AGE,
ENSURING THEIR LOYALTY

358
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:38,912
AND THEIR ARMY
SHOULD WE NEED IT.

359
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:42,874
MYRCELLA SENT AWAY
TO DORNE?

360
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:48,296
BUT REMEMBER,
THE QUEEN MUSTN'T KNOW.

361
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,341
OOH, "THE QUEEN
MUSTN'T KNOW."

362
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:55,095
I LOVE CONVERSATIONS
THAT BEGIN THIS WAY.

363
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:58,306
I PLAN TO MARRY
PRINCESS MYRCELLA OFF

364
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,100
TO THEON GREYJOY.

365
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:04,271
THEON GREYJOY?

366
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:06,982
FORGIVE ME, MY LORD,
BUT HOW?

367
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:09,859
HE GREW UP A WARD
OF WINTERFELL.

368
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:11,611
HE FIGHTS
FOR ROBB STARK.

369
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:15,073
PRECISELY.
THEON'S FATHER
LOATHES THE STARKS

370
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:17,826
AND WILL CONVINCE THE BOY
TO COME TO OUR SIDE.

371
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:21,496
GREYJOY CAN DESTROY
THE NORTHERN ARMY FROM WITHIN

372
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:23,957
<i>AND WE CAN HAVE</i>
<i>HIS FATHER'S SHIPS.</i>

373
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,502
BUT REMEMBER,
YOU MUST TELL NO ONE.

374
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:30,005
TELL NO ONE WHAT?

375
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:34,092
I PLAN TO WED
PRINCESS MYRCELLA TO
ROBIN ARRYN OF THE VALE.

376
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:38,555
LYSA IS NOT FOND OF ME.

377
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:41,016
BUT PERHAPS THE PROMISE
OF A ROYAL MATCH

378
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:44,185
WILL CONVINCE HER
TO LET BYGONES BE BYGONES.

379
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,104
SHE IMPRISONED YOU.

380
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:48,231
SHE TRIED
TO EXECUTE YOU.

381
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:51,359
AND YOU OFFER
HER SON A PRINCESS?

382
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:55,280
FOR MEN IN OUR POSITION,
HOLDING GRUDGES CAN BE

383
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:56,906
AN ENCUMBRANCE,
DON'T YOU THINK?

384
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:01,494
AND I SUPPOSE YOU WANT ME
TO BROKER THIS AGREEMENT?

385
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:03,163
WHO BETTER?

386
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,502
YES, I COULD SING
THIS SONG TO LYSA,

387
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:11,796
IF I CARED TO.

388
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,007
WHAT'S IN IT
FOR ME?

389
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:18,386
THE GRATITUDE OF
THE PEOPLE OF WESTEROS

390
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,221
FOR HELPING TO END
THIS WAR,

391
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:24,476
THE ADORATION OF THE KING
FOR BRINGING THE VALE
BACK INTO THE FOLD...

392
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:28,271
AND HARRENHAL.

393
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,523
HARRENHAL IS CURSED.

394
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,692
NEVER TOOK YOU
FOR A SUPERSTITIOUS MAN.

395
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,402
BY ALL MEANS,
TEAR IT DOWN AND REBUILD.

396
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,321
YOU'LL BE ABLE
TO AFFORD IT.

397
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:39,115
I PLAN TO MAKE YOU
LORD OF THE RIVERLANDS.

398
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:43,620
WITH A SINGLE STROKE,
YOU'D MAKE ME ONE OF THE
GREATEST LORDS IN THE REALM.

399
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:46,748
YOU SERVED MY FAMILY WELL
IN THE MATTER OF THE SUCCESSION.

400
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:50,210
SO DID JANOS SLYNT,
AND HE WAS GIVEN
HARRENHAL, TOO.

401
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:53,088
UNTIL YOU SNATCHED IT AWAY.

402
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,256
I NEED YOU TO
DELIVER LYSA ARRYN.

403
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,176
I DIDN'T NEED
JANOS SLYNT.

404
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:03,181
<i>IT'S SETTLED, THEN?</i>

405
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:06,393
GOOD.

406
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,979
OH, AND REMEMBER--

407
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:11,981
THE QUEEN MUSTN'T KNOW.

408
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:26,538
( breathing heavily )

409
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,814
THAT MUST HURT.

410
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,066
( groans )

411
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:05,076
WHAT?

412
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:08,037
WHAT IS IT?

413
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:10,290
( scoffs )

414
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:13,042
A MEMBER OF THE KINGSGUARD?

415
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:16,087
AS IF I WASN'T HUMILIATED
ENOUGH ALREADY.

416
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,298
( sighs )

417
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:22,594
BRIENNE IS A VERY
CAPABLE WARRIOR.

418
00:29:23,761 --> 00:29:26,055
AND SHE'S DEVOTED TO ME.

419
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:30,226
YOU'RE JEALOUS.

420
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,353
JEALOUS?

421
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,355
OF BRIENNE THE BEAUTY?

422
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,649
DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH.

423
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:41,863
- I'LL MAKE IT UP TO YOU.
- NO, YOUR GRACE.

424
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:44,991
NOT TONIGHT.

425
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:47,619
THERE'S ANOTHER TYRELL
WHO REQUIRES YOUR ATTENTION.

426
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,329
YOU DIDN'T WIN
MY FATHER'S SUPPORT

427
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:51,456
OR HIS ARMY
ON CHARM ALONE.

428
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:08,848
YOUR VASSALS ARE STARTING
TO SNIGGER BEHIND YOUR BACK.

429
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:12,060
BRIDES AREN'T USUALLY
VIRGINS TWO WEEKS AFTER
THEIR WEDDING NIGHT.

430
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:13,728
AND MARGAERY'S A VIRGIN?

431
00:30:13,811 --> 00:30:16,147
OFFICIALLY.

432
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:19,901
SHALL I BRING HER
TO YOU?

433
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:48,680
I SHOULD WARN YOU,

434
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:50,557
I'VE HAD QUITE
A BIT OF WINE.

435
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,017
AS IS YOUR RIGHT.
YOU ARE A KING.

436
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:57,146
YOU LOOK
VERY BEAUTIFUL.

437
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,940
THANK YOU,
YOUR GRACE.

438
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:03,027
- IT'S A LOVELY GOWN.
-<i> YOU THINK SO?</i>

439
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:05,905
I CAN'T DECIDE
HOW I LIKE IT BETTER.

440
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:08,032
THIS WAY...

441
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,952
OR THIS WAY.

442
00:31:16,874 --> 00:31:18,543
YOU CERTAINLY DON'T NEED IT.

443
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,629
ALTHOUGH...

444
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:25,216
SOME SAY THAT
BEAUTY MOST DESIRED

445
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,135
IS THE BEAUTY CONCEALED.

446
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:46,029
MUST BE THE WINE.

447
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:48,656
HERE, LET ME.

448
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:06,716
( shudders )

449
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:10,261
I'M SORRY.

450
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,555
DO YOU WANT MY BROTHER
TO COME IN AND HELP?

451
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:18,019
- WHAT?
- HE COULD GET YOU STARTED.

452
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:22,106
I KNOW HE WOULDN'T MIND.
OR I CAN TURN OVER AND YOU
CAN PRETEND I'M HIM.

453
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,903
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

454
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:34,994
THERE'S NO NEED
FOR US TO PLAY GAMES.

455
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:38,164
SAVE YOUR LIES FOR COURT.
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED
A LOT OF THEM.

456
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:59,602
YOUR ENEMIES
AREN'T HAPPY ABOUT US.

457
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:02,146
THEY WANT TO TEAR
US APART.

458
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:05,316
AND THE BEST WAY
TO STOP THEM

459
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,528
IS TO PUT YOUR BABY

460
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:11,030
IN MY BELLY.

461
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:16,035
WE CAN TRY AGAIN LATER.

462
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,954
YOU DECIDE HOW
YOU WANT TO DO IT--

463
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:19,872
WITH ME,
WITH ME AND LORAS.

464
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:22,417
HOWEVER ELSE YOU LIKE.

465
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:27,797
WHATEVER YOU NEED TO DO.

466
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:32,927
YOU ARE A KING.

467
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:43,271
Cersei:
<i>YOU MONSTER.</i>

468
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,773
MYRCELLA IS MY ONLY DAUGHTER.

469
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,359
DO YOU REALLY THINK
I'LL LET YOU SELL HER
LIKE A COMMON WHORE?

470
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:49,986
MYRCELLA'S A PRINCESS.

471
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:51,612
SOME WOULD SAY
SHE WAS BORN FOR THIS.

472
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,489
I WILL NOT LET YOU
SHIP HER OFF TO DORNE

473
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,408
AS I WAS SHIPPED OFF
TO ROBERT BARATHEON.

474
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:57,869
DORNE IS THE SAFEST PLACE
FOR HER.

475
00:33:57,952 --> 00:34:01,414
ARE YOU MAD?
THE MARTELLS LOATHE US.

476
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:03,791
THAT'S WHY WE NEED
TO SEDUCE THEM.

477
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,752
WE'RE GOING TO NEED
THEIR SUPPORT IN THE WAR

478
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,503
YOUR SON STARTED.

479
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,881
- SHE'LL BE A HOSTAGE.
- A GUEST.

480
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:12,550
YOU WON'T GET AWAY
WITH THIS.

481
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:16,596
YOU THINK THE PIECE
OF PAPER FATHER GAVE YOU
KEEPS YOU SAFE.

482
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:21,768
NED STARK HAD A PIECE
OF PAPER, TOO.

483
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:26,814
- IT'S DONE, CERSEI.
- NO.

484
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:32,695
- YOU CANNOT STOP IT.
- NO!

485
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:35,823
<i>JUST HOW SAFE DO YOU</i>
<i>THINK MYRCELLA IS IF</i>
<i>THIS CITY FALLS?</i>

486
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:39,952
DO YOU WANT TO SEE HER
RAPED, BUTCHERED LIKE
THE TARGARYEN CHILDREN?

487
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:42,038
MAKE NO MISTAKE.

488
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:44,791
THEY'LL MOUNT HER PRETTY
LITTLE HEAD ON A SPIKE
RIGHT BESIDE YOURS.

489
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:47,126
GET OUT!
GET OUT!

490
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:51,899
THEON OF
THE HOUSE GREYJOY,

491
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:55,653
YOU WOULD THIS DAY
CONSECRATE YOUR FAITH
TO THE DROWNED GOD?

492
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:06,497
- I WOULD.
-<i> KNEEL.</i>

493
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:10,918
LET THEON,
YOUR SERVANT,

494
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:14,255
BE BORN AGAIN FROM
THE SEA AS YOU WERE.

495
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:16,883
BLESS HIM WITH SALT.

496
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:22,179
BLESS HIM WITH STONE.

497
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:23,848
BLESS HIM WITH STEEL.

498
00:36:29,186 --> 00:36:31,272
WHAT IS DEAD
MAY NEVER DIE.

499
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,399
WHAT IS DEAD
MAY NEVER DIE...

500
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:38,487
BUT RISES AGAIN
HARDER AND STRONGER.

501
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,740
STAND.

502
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,846
<i>( dog barking )</i>

503
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,143
<i>( footsteps approaching )</i>

504
00:37:09,226 --> 00:37:13,689
I DON'T APPRECIATE BEING
MADE A FOOL OF, DWARF.

505
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,399
IF MYRCELLA MARRIES
THE MARTELL BOY,

506
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,443
SHE CAN'T VERY WELL
MARRY ROBIN ARRYN,
CAN SHE?

507
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:20,821
NO, AFRAID NOT.
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

508
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,448
AND HARRENHAL--

509
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:25,576
I SUPPOSE THAT'S
OFF THE TABLE AS WELL.

510
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:29,246
YES, I FEAR SO.
SORRY ABOUT THAT, TOO.

511
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,624
LEAVE ME OUT OF YOUR
NEXT DECEPTION.

512
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:33,709
OH, THAT'S A SHAME.

513
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:36,921
YOU WERE TO BE
THE CENTERPIECE OF
MY NEXT DECEPTION.

514
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:40,174
MY BROTHER JAIME ROTS
IN A NORTHERN STOCKADE.

515
00:37:40,257 --> 00:37:42,468
I WOULD SEE HIM RELEASED.

516
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:43,970
THAT'S WHERE YOU COME IN.

517
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:46,389
ROBB STARK WILL NEVER
RELEASE THE KINGSLAYER.

518
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:50,184
NO, HE WON'T.
BUT HIS MOTHER MIGHT.

519
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:53,187
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE
YOUR BELOVED CAT AGAIN?

520
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:55,564
<i>( footsteps approaching )</i>

521
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:59,026
- FIND HIM?
- OH, AYE.

522
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,987
AND HE HAS COMPANY.

523
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:04,949
FILTHY OLD STOAT.
ALMOST HATE TO INTERRUPT.

524
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:08,411
- NO, YOU DON'T.
- NO, I DON'T.

525
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:15,543
- ( door bursts )
- ( gasps )

526
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:18,254
WHAT IS THE MEANING
OF THIS?

527
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:20,464
NO, PLEASE, PLEASE.

528
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,842
YOU DISAPPOINT ME,
GRAND MAESTER.

529
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:25,594
I AM YOUR LOYAL SERVANT.

530
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:28,931
SO LOYAL THAT YOU TOLD
THE QUEEN ABOUT MY PLANS
TO SEND MYRCELLA TO DORNE.

531
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:30,850
NO! NEVER!

532
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:33,519
IT'S A FALSEHOOD.
I SWEAR IT.

533
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:34,895
IT WASN'T ME.

534
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,731
AH, VARYS.

535
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:40,026
IT WAS VARYS
THE SPIDER.

536
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:43,988
SEE, I TOLD VARYS THAT
I WAS GIVING THE PRINCESS
TO THE GREYJOYS.

537
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:48,743
I TOLD LITTLEFINGER
THAT I PLANNED TO WED
HER TO ROBIN ARRYN.

538
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:52,121
I TOLD NO ONE THAT I WAS
OFFERING HER TO THE DORNISH.

539
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:54,331
NO ONE BUT YOU.

540
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:57,043
THE EUNUCH HAS
SPIES EVERYWHERE.

541
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:59,295
CUT OFF HIS MANHOOD
AND FEED IT TO THE GOATS.

542
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:01,881
- NO, NO, NO.
- THERE ARE NO GOATS, HALFMAN.

543
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:03,966
WELL, MAKE DO.

544
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,177
( whimpering )

545
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,346
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN SPYING FOR MY SISTER?

546
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:11,057
ALL I DID, I DID
FOR HOUSE LANNISTER.

547
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,559
<i>ALWAYS.</i>
<i>YOUR LORD FATHER,</i>
<i>ASK HIM.</i>

548
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:15,352
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
HIS SERVANT

549
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,480
SINCE THE DAYS
OF THE MAD KING.

550
00:39:19,356 --> 00:39:22,234
- I DON'T LIKE HIS BEARD.
- WHAT?

551
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:24,278
WHAT?
OH, NO. NO.

552
00:39:24,361 --> 00:39:27,281
( whimpering )

553
00:39:27,364 --> 00:39:30,326
HOW MANY HANDS HAVE YOU
BETRAYED, PYCELLE?

554
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:32,953
EDDARD STARK?
JON ARRYN?

555
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,747
LORD ARRYN,
HE KNEW.

556
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:37,625
( stammering )
HE KNEW THE TRUTH
ABOUT THE QUEEN.

557
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:41,170
AND, WELL,
HE PLANNED TO ACT,

558
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:43,297
TO TELL KING ROBERT.

559
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,465
SO YOU POISONED HIM?

560
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:46,801
NO. NEVER.

561
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:49,637
BUT YOU LET HIM DIE,
MADE SURE HE SUCCUMBED.

562
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,306
LANNISTER--
I ALWAYS SERVED LANNISTER.

563
00:39:52,389 --> 00:39:54,975
GET HIM OUT OF MY SIGHT.
THROW HIM IN ONE OF
THE BLACK CELLS.

564
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,977
OH, NO.
NO, NO, NO.
NO, PLEASE.

565
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,146
<i>DON'T!</i>
<i>YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!</i>

566
00:40:00,397 --> 00:40:01,649
FOR YOUR TROUBLE.

567
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:04,402
<i>( Pycelle shouting )</i>

568
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:28,843
YOU'LL BE PLEASED TO KNOW
OUR MUTUAL FRIEND

569
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:32,429
<i>IS DOING QUITE WELL</i>
<i>IN LADY SANSA'S SERVICE.</i>

570
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:35,683
GOOD.
ONE OF MY BETTER IDEAS.

571
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:38,102
AND IT SEEMS
THE GRAND MAESTER

572
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:40,688
HAS FOUND HIS WAY
INTO A BLACK CELL.

573
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:44,650
WELL PLAYED,
MY LORD HAND.

574
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,237
BUT SHOULD I BE WORRIED?

575
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,197
JANOS SLYNT,
PYCELLE--

576
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:53,534
THE SMALL COUNCIL
GROWS SMALLER EVERY DAY.

577
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:56,495
THE COUNCIL HAS A REPUTATION
FOR SERVING PAST HANDS POORLY.

578
00:40:56,579 --> 00:41:00,499
I DON'T MEAN TO FOLLOW
NED STARK TO THE GRAVE.

579
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:04,170
POWER IS A CURIOUS THING,
MY LORD.

580
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:06,297
ARE YOU FOND OF RIDDLES?

581
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,257
WHY, AM I ABOUT
TO HEAR ONE?

582
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,593
THREE GREAT MEN
SIT IN A ROOM.

583
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:13,387
A KING, A PRIEST
AND A RICH MAN.

584
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:16,056
BETWEEN THEM STANDS
A COMMON SELLSWORD.

585
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:20,227
<i>EACH GREAT MAN</i>
<i>BIDS THE SELLSWORD</i>
<i>KILL THE OTHER TWO.</i>

586
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,897
WHO LIVES, WHO DIES?

587
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,232
DEPENDS ON THE SELLSWORD.

588
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,401
DOES IT?
HE HAS NEITHER CROWN

589
00:41:27,484 --> 00:41:29,445
NOR GOLD NOR FAVOR
WITH THE GODS.

590
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:31,822
HE HAS A SWORD,
THE POWER OF LIFE AND DEATH.

591
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:34,033
BUT IF IT'S SWORDSMEN
WHO RULE,

592
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:36,535
WHY DO WE PRETEND
KINGS HOLD ALL THE POWER?

593
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:39,246
<i>WHEN NED STARK</i>
<i>LOST HIS HEAD,</i>

594
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:42,291
<i>WHO WAS TRULY RESPONSIBLE?</i>

595
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:44,543
JOFFREY?
THE EXECUTIONER?

596
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:46,212
OR SOMETHING ELSE?

597
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:48,631
I'VE DECIDED
I DON'T LIKE RIDDLES.

598
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:56,013
POWER RESIDES WHERE
MEN BELIEVE IT RESIDES.

599
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:57,848
IT'S A TRICK,

600
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:00,601
A SHADOW ON THE WALL.

601
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:04,438
AND A VERY SMALL MAN

602
00:42:04,521 --> 00:42:07,107
CAN CAST A VERY LARGE SHADOW.

603
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:15,157
<i>( crickets chirping )</i>

604
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,868
<i>( horse whinnies )</i>

605
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:20,788
( snoring )

606
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:31,966
<i>( door opens )</i>

607
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,567
YOU SHOULD BE SLEEPING.

608
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:52,903
TOMORROW'S A LONG MARCH.

609
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:55,864
30 MILES IF IT
DON'T PISS ON US.

610
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:59,034
I CAN'T SLEEP.

611
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:05,207
I DON'T LIKE THE TASTE.

612
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,710
( chuckles )

613
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:10,879
WELL...

614
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:14,842
YOU DON'T DRINK IT
FOR THE FLAVOR, TO BE HONEST.

615
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:24,018
WHAT?

616
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:27,479
HOW DO YOU SLEEP?

617
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:29,815
SAME AS MOST MEN,
I THINK.

618
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:32,443
BUT YOU'VE SEEN THINGS,

619
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:35,863
HORRIBLE THINGS.

620
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:38,574
AYE.

621
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:41,410
I'VE SEEN SOME
PRETTY THINGS, TOO,

622
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:43,704
BUT NOT NEARLY SO MANY.

623
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:47,207
HOW DO YOU SLEEP
WHEN YOU--

624
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:53,422
WHEN YOU HAVE THOSE
THINGS IN YOUR HEAD?

625
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:58,427
YOU DIDN'T SEE THAT.

626
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,054
I MADE DAMN SURE.

627
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:02,514
I CLOSE MY EYES
AND I SEE THEM UP THERE.

628
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:06,352
ALL OF THEM

629
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:08,937
STANDING THERE--

630
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:11,398
JOFFREY,

631
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:14,193
THE QUEEN,

632
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:16,403
AND--

633
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:19,073
AND MY SISTER.

634
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:31,585
YOU KNOW, WE'VE GOT
SOMETHING IN COMMON,
ME AND YOU.

635
00:44:31,668 --> 00:44:34,046
YOU KNOW THAT?

636
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:36,423
I MUST HAVE BEEN

637
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:39,009
A COUPLE OF YEARS
OLDER THAN YOU.

638
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:43,222
I SAW MY BROTHER STABBED
THROUGH THE HEART

639
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:45,474
<i>RIGHT ON OUR DOORSTEP.</i>

640
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:49,019
<i>HE WEREN'T MUCH OF A VILLAIN</i>
<i>WHAT SKEWERED HIM.</i>

641
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:51,730
<i>WILLEM, THE LAD'S NAME WAS.</i>

642
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:55,734
HE RAN OFF BEFORE
ANYONE COULD SPIT.

643
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:59,029
AND I JUST STOOD THERE,

644
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:01,907
WATCHING MY BROTHER DIE.

645
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:06,453
<i>BUT HERE'S THE FUNNY PART.</i>

646
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:09,873
I CAN'T PICTURE
MY BROTHER'S FACE ANYMORE.

647
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:12,334
<i>BUT WILLEM--</i>

648
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:15,587
OH, HE WAS
A NICE-LOOKING BOY.

649
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:19,341
HE HAD GOOD WHITE TEETH,

650
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:21,635
BLUE EYES,

651
00:45:21,718 --> 00:45:25,597
<i>ONE OF THOSE DIMPLED CHINS</i>
<i>ALL THE GIRLS LIKE.</i>

652
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:30,310
<i>I WOULD THINK ABOUT HIM</i>
<i>WHEN I WAS WORKING,</i>

653
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:34,565
WHEN I WAS DRINKING,
WHEN I WAS HAVING A SHIT.

654
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:36,733
IT GOT TO THE POINT

655
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:40,070
WHERE I WOULD SAY
HIS NAME EVERY NIGHT
BEFORE I WENT TO BED.

656
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:42,739
WILLEM. WILLEM.

657
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:45,451
<i>WILLEM.</i>

658
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:47,578
A PRAYER ALMOST.

659
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:53,250
<i>WELL, ONE DAY...</i>

660
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:57,212
<i>WILLEM CAME RIDING</i>
<i>BACK INTO TOWN.</i>

661
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:03,760
I BURIED AN AX SO DEEP
INTO WILLEM'S SKULL,

662
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:07,556
<i>THEY HAD TO BURY</i>
<i>HIM WITH IT.</i>

663
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:10,976
WILLEM'S HORSE
GOT ME TO THE WALL

664
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:13,979
AND I'VE BEEN WEARING
BLACK EVER SINCE.

665
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,818
WELL...

666
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:22,988
THAT'LL HELP YOU SLEEP, EH?

667
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:26,450
<i>( horn sounds )</i>

668
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:29,077
<i>( men shouting )</i>

669
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:30,287
HO!

670
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:33,373
GET UP, YOU LAZY
SONS OF WHORES!

671
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:36,460
ARM YOURSELVES.

672
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,045
- Gendry: GET UP.
- Arya: GET UP.

673
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:39,880
KEEP OUT OF SIGHT,
BOTH OF YOU.

674
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:41,423
- NO, I'M NOT AFRAID.
- I CAN FIGHT.

675
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:43,717
KEEP OUT OF SIGHT.

676
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,303
IF THINGS GO WRONG,
YOU RUN.

677
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:50,432
DO YOU HEAR ME?
YOU RUN ALONG NORTH
AND DON'T LOOK BACK.

678
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:53,101
HEY, THERE'S MEN
OUT THERE

679
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:55,312
WHO WANT TO FUCK
YOUR CORPSES.

680
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:58,065
OUTSIDE, NOW!

681
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:01,485
Man:
<i>COME ON, MOVE, MOVE!</i>

682
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:03,362
<i>( horse whinnies )</i>

683
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:04,821
GOLD CLOAKS!

( shouting )

685
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:12,746
EVERYONE OUT!

686
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:16,583
( shouting )

687
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:20,420
HEY, YOU!
OPEN THE DAMN CAGE!

688
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:25,551
WHERE'S THE BASTARD, CROW?

689
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:28,262
GOT MORE THAN
A FEW BASTARDS HERE.
WHO'S ASKING?

690
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:30,931
SER AMORY LORCH,
SWORN BANNERMAN TO
LORD TYWIN LANNISTER.

691
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:35,269
<i>THESE MEN FROM THE CAPITAL</i>
<i>REQUESTED OUR ASSISTANCE.</i>

692
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:37,229
DROP YOUR WEAPONS
IN THE NAME OF THE KING.

693
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:39,356
NOW, WHICH KING
WOULD THAT BE?

694
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:41,233
THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE.

695
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:43,944
IN THE NAME
OF KING JOFFREY,

696
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:46,196
DROP YOUR WEAPONS.

697
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:51,660
( spits )
I DON'T THINK I WILL.

698
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:53,954
SO BE IT.

699
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:56,582
( grunts )

700
00:47:56,665 --> 00:48:00,085
I ALWAYS HATED CROSSBOWS.
TAKE TOO LONG TO LOAD.

701
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:19,271
( groans )

702
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,946
( gurgles )

703
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:40,042
Jaqen:
BOY, COME HERE.
BOY!

704
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:43,670
- SWEET BOY, HELP US.
- COME BACK HERE!

705
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,047
HELP US, BOY!

706
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:47,633
( shouting )

707
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:51,637
A MAN CAN FIGHT!
FREE US!

708
00:48:58,101 --> 00:49:00,604
QUICK, GIVE IT TO ME.

709
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:04,691
GIVE ME THE AX.
GIVE ME THAT.

710
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:14,701
Soldier:
<i>PUT 'EM ON THE WAGON!</i>

711
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,870
<i>THERE'S MORE HERE.</i>
<i>COME ON.</i>

712
00:49:16,953 --> 00:49:19,915
( grunts )

713
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:22,084
( chuckles )

714
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:25,587
WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE?

715
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:27,506
NO!

716
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:31,051
THAT'S A FINE
LITTLE BLADE.

717
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:33,387
MAYBE I'LL PICK
MY TEETH WITH IT.

718
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:35,347
I YIELD!
I YIELD!

719
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:37,724
Amory:
<i>ROUND UP ANY SURVIVORS.</i>

720
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,559
WE'LL TAKE THEM BACK
TO HARRENHAL.

721
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:42,938
YOU HEARD HIM.
YOU'RE COMING WITH US.

722
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:45,440
I YIELD!

723
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:49,736
( whimpering )

724
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,822
HELP!

725
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:53,824
HELP ME!

726
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:59,037
SOMETHING WRONG
WITH YOUR LEG, BOY?

727
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:00,956
LOOK AT IT.

728
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:10,507
CAN YOU WALK?

729
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:13,427
NO.
YOU GOT TO CARRY ME.

730
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:16,680
ALL RIGHT.

731
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:26,732
( coughing )

732
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,487
CARRY HIM, HE SAYS.
( laughs )

733
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,290
WE'RE LOOKING FOR
A BASTARD NAMED GENDRY.

734
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:46,501
<i>GIVE HIM UP</i>

735
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:48,879
OR I'LL START
TAKING EYEBALLS.

736
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:03,059
YOU WANT GENDRY?

737
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,982
YOU ALREADY GOT HIM.

738
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:15,113
<i>HE LOVED THAT HELMET.</i>

739
00:51:25,916 --> 00:52:43,660
