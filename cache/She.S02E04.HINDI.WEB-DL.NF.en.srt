1
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,080
The recipients of the special
award for distinctive service.

2
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,160
Senior Constable Bhumika Pardeshi.

3
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,320
Bhumika Pardeshi?

4
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,320
She's not here.

5
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,000
You can move on to the next award.

6
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,280
-Alam Ji?
-Sir?

7
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,160
Bhumika Pardeshi was our undercover
agent for this operation, right?

8
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,080
Right, sir.

9
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,720
And she's not here?

10
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,680
-Cheers!
-Cheers! Well done, team!

11
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,800
-Nice! Yeah, okay.
-Leena, come here. Let's take a selfie!

12
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,400
250 crore!

13
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,440
Do you think you're ever
gonna see 250 crore rupees?

14
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,200
Kamble Ji, I haven't seen more
than 2,500 bucks in my dreams.

15
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,320
It's true!

16
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,680
Come on, Karmarkar!

17
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,520
What's wrong, sir?

18
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,880
Withdrawal symptoms?

19
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,360
I don't believe it.

20
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,600
That's true.

21
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,680
No, not like that.

22
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,520
I still think there's something wrong.

23
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,280
It was a little too easy.

24
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,480
Sir, you should stop worrying.

25
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,800
That's our job.

26
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,520
Khan!

27
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,840
Come, like always,

28
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,280
let's hope I'm wrong.

29
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,080
Sir.

30
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,240
Come, Bhumi.

31
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,120
Sit.

32
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,520
You didn't come to the
felicitation yesterday?

33
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,200
Sir, I'm an undercover officer.

34
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm better off in the background.

35
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,200
You could've at least come to the party?

36
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,240
Anyway...

37
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,760
the operation is now over.

38
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,040
But you could still be under threat.

39
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,720
You cannot live at your
home for a few more days.

40
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,840
Continue living in the hotel room.

41
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,400
And take a break!

42
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,400
You deserve it.

43
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,680
Yes, sir.

44
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,040
She isn't here, right?

45
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,160
Mom!

46
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,520
You've lost more weight!

47
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,760
Forget about my weight, Mom!

48
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,440
Listen...

49
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,680
I have a few days off.

50
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,920
Would you like to go to
Solapur to your sister's?

51
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,440
I would love to.

52
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,120
But Rupa won't come with me.

53
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,760
She isn't a child anymore, Mom.

54
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,200
She can live alone for a few days.

55
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,320
What's the big deal?

56
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,400
-Hey, Shushila!
-Welcome, Sunita!

57
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,280
-It's been a long time! How are you?
-How are you?

58
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,840
Bhumi, you're looking
so pretty, sweetheart!

59
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,600
-Mom, I'll get going.
-What is it?

60
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,600
What?

61
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,440
Do you really have to leave?

62
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,000
I just got a call from the office.
I'll have to leave.

63
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,600
Can't you stay here for a night?
You said you had a few days off, right?

64
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,080
I'll come back in a couple of
days to pick you up, alright?

65
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,680
This is our native village, ma'am.

66
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,600
Our families live here.

67
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,440
"Nayakuddu" means leader.

68
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,520
He's our leader.

69
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,760
Do these people know what Nayak does?

70
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,080
No, they don't.

71
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,840
They don't care either.

72
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,160
-Nayakuddu's the only one who knows.
-Hey!

73
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,800
Come here. Have a look.

74
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,960
<i>After I saw them,
I wanted to feel like them.</i>

75
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,280
<i>Yes, it's wrong.</i>

76
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,880
<i>But it's fun.</i>

77
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,240
Young Nayak must be watching us right now.

78
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,240
Let's run away.

79
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,000
Brother will get to us if we don't.

80
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,480
I'm glad you're enjoying the food.

81
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,360
I've specially cooked
all these dishes for you!

82
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,960
She's saying these are my favorite dishes.

83
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,200
Do you remember?

84
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,920
He used to love fried
eggplant when he was young?

85
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,320
Of course, I remember!

86
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,720
He used to throw a
tantrum if he didn't get it.

87
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,840
Thank you.

88
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,440
-Goodbye.
-Thank you.

89
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,760
<i>What a life!</i>

90
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,960
I've never had the
privilege to enjoy this life.

91
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,240
By chance...

92
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,960
if you get this life,

93
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,840
would you like it?

94
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,320
No.

95
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,920
Not even with you.

96
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,080
We are the same, you and I.

97
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,160
Scumbags!

98
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,320
I don't remember the last time
I've laughed out loud in this house.

99
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,880
One day's enough.

100
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,920
The horrors of this house will
start haunting me if I stay here.

101
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,840
I won't repeat myself...

102
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm warning you for the last time!

103
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,040
Will you do it again?

104
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,160
Will you do it again?

105
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,320
<i>Oh, God!</i>

106
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,240
<i>Marrying you was the
biggest mistake of my life!</i>

107
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,840
<i>This house starts suffocating me
if I live here for more than a day.</i>

108
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,960
I understand.

109
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,600
Exactly.

110
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,000
The child inside me
and the child inside you,

111
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,520
they're friends.

112
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,760
They're happy when we're together.

113
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,480
<i>I want to bring this to your notice.</i>

114
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,360
Although, you might think...

115
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,400
"Why does the Commissioner of
Mumbai Police need to hear it?"

116
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,440
Infiltration has increased
dramatically on the border.

117
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,000
<i>Armed terrorists.</i>

118
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,880
<i>And this is a well-researched fact.</i>

119
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,000
<i>Global terrorism and the drug mafia...</i>

120
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,720
<i>are usually connected.</i>

121
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,840
You see, Alam, both need to
infiltrate national borders.

122
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,600
<i>The drug mafia funds the terrorists...</i>

123
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,960
<i>for buying arms and all.</i>

124
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,880
<i>And terrorism facilitates
drugs crossing the border.</i>

125
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,680
What if we didn't catch everyone?

126
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,920
Some people must be
outside Nayak's network.

127
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,480
{\an8}The movement of drugs hasn't stopped.

128
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,680
There's no evidence, sir.

129
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,360
<i>If these are the reports on the surface,</i>

130
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,960
<i>the underground operation
must be much bigger.</i>

131
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,720
Mom!

132
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,760
Come on!

133
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,840
No, Mom.

134
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,520
Oh, come on!

135
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,520
Mom!

136
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,720
I've given Rupa my word.

137
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,280
How are you?

138
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,360
Did you hear me?

139
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,920
You said you wanted to be my Sasya.

140
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,920
But I had to finish him off.

141
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,200
It must bother you.

142
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,160
Not anymore.

143
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,520
But it does bother me.

144
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,520
What?

145
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,200
You've seen my face...

146
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,560
just like Sasya had.

147
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,200
And one day, I won't need you anymore.

148
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,400
And with the kind of person that I am,

149
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,160
why would I let you go?

150
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,600
But I would like to try.

151
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,480
I'll try and ensure that you'll
never be useless to my operation.

152
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,880
That should save you.

153
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,040
-But I'll never...
-I know.

154
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,000
I can see you're coming on my side.

155
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,440
I'm already on your side.

156
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,160
Trust me, I am!

157
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,360
Not completely.

158
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,200
But you will be.

159
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,440
You're getting there.

160
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,200
You're slowly becoming like me.

161
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,360
You're close.

162
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,760
Tell me.

163
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,360
What do I need to do?

164
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,080
Set up a new drug
distribution network in Mumbai.

165
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,920
And then, in some other cities.

166
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,920
Sasya had set up my network.

167
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,960
But he turned out to be a rat.

168
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,880
I was forced to revamp it...

169
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,080
in a hurry.

170
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,680
The network's functioning...

171
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,240
but it isn't solid.

172
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,960
We need to change it and
set up a new network.

173
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,560
And you'll do it.

174
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,280
How?

175
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,520
Wouldn't you be "useless"
if I tell you how to do it?

176
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,880
You need to get the drugs to
the drug consumers in Mumbai.

177
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,280
How will you do it?

178
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,240
These women are willing to do
anything to make a decent living!

179
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,160
They aren't cowards either.

180
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,880
They know how to deal
with the cops as well.

181
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,840
<i>And they have nowhere to go.</i>

182
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,360
<i>They'll be loyal to us.</i>

183
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,960
And there's no dearth of these women.

184
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,040
No one's interested
in them after they age.

185
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,720
Like I said...

186
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,640
you're a natural.

187
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,760
<i>Where have I landed up?</i>

188
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,720
Twenty-four!

189
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,560
What am I gonna do?

190
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,840
Twenty-six!

191
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,800
Hey, stop disturbing me!

192
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,160
I need to finish my workout!

193
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,120
Who am I supposed to talk to?!

194
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,520
Who will listen to me?

195
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,840
Should I talk to that lamp post?

196
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,480
Why would I care?!

197
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,800
I'll pay you.

198
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,400
Really?

199
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,840
Go on.

200
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,280
You see...

201
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,560
I was never "good"...

202
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,800
at anything.

203
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,160
I used to work really hard.

204
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,320
I used to prepare for my exams all night.

205
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,280
But my grades were always mediocre.

206
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,480
I was the one who
practiced volleyball the most!

207
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,720
Do you know where I was on match day?

208
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,400
On the bench.

209
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,320
Extra.

210
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,600
I was always an extra.

211
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,480
Just pay up.

212
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,960
Hurry!

213
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,080
Yeah, I'll give you more,
please listen to me!

214
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,800
My father...

215
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,840
he always treated
me as an extra as well.

216
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,880
I used to get him piping
hot tea every morning!

217
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,680
But who was his favorite?

218
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,560
Rupa.

219
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,960
I tried really hard...

220
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,360
to make my marriage work...

221
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,200
by pleasuring him.

222
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,920
By pleasuring him with this body.

223
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,320
But I failed.

224
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,640
Look, just pay up and scram!

225
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,840
I finally feel like...

226
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,440
I can be good at something.

227
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,240
<i>But this path I'm about to take...</i>

228
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,720
<i>is a one-way street.</i>

229
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,880
<i>But I'll handle it.</i>

230
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,160
<i>And I will succeed.</i>

231
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,040
Because I know one thing for sure...

232
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,200
I'm not gonna die.

233
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,480
<i>They're all living!</i>

234
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,760
<i>They're all happy!</i>

235
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,360
Why should I die?

236
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,920
I'll be happy as well.

237
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,520
I'll be happy as well.

238
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,440
<i>Sources report a rise in illegal
drug consumption in metro cities.</i>

239
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,200
<i>The spokesperson of
Gaamdevi Medical Hospital</i>

240
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:28,480
<i>says that there is increase in patients
with illegal drug usage at the hospital.</i>

241
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,160
What is this?

242
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,440
Look what Bhumi's got!

243
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,520
Microwave!

244
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,440
And look at this TV!

245
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,560
It's brand new!

246
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,600
Look at how slim it is!
It's beautiful, right?

247
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,520
Right?

248
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,000
Why has she sent this?

249
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,440
Why's she doing it?!

250
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,200
How did she get the money?!

251
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,240
How?!

252
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,440
Are they really paying a
police constable a hefty salary?!

253
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,440
Get it out!

254
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,040
Get it out of my house!

255
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,480
Come on!

256
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,720
Let's throw it away!

257
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,080
-Calm down.
-This money is tainted!

258
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,160
And I don't want it in my house!

259
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,760
I don't care what "business"
your daughter's into.

260
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,160
I don't want a penny from her dirty pile!

261
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,160
People might hear you!

262
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,080
-Calm...
-"What will people say?"

263
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,240
"What will people say?"
That's all you care...

264
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,160
That's all you care about.

265
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,360
That's all you care about.

266
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,360
This is our business.
It means we bear the risk as well.

267
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,760
Every single person
who walks into this group

268
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,480
must be extremely trustworthy.

269
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,480
If you break the trust,

270
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,240
you will lose your life.

271
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,640
The rest of the group will kill you.

272
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,000
We need to support each other.

273
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,960
They're all out there, waiting to pounce.

274
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,400
But we'll get to them...

275
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,600
before they get us.

276
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,400
I'm giving you a number.

277
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,240
Use it for coordination.
They'll answer all your questions.

278
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,280
Give them the names and
numbers of your agents.

279
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,920
Give them the weight of the
material that the agent can transport.

280
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,760
You can expect a reply...

281
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,400
in exactly 15 minutes.

282
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,200
You'll get a drug consignment.

283
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,440
<i>Use your network</i>

284
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,640
<i>and take it to the customers.</i>

285
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,480
<i>First, in Mumbai,</i>

286
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,840
<i>and then you'll set up
networks all over the country.</i>

287
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,080
<i>You will do it.</i>

288
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,080
I don't exist.

289
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,160
You do.

290
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,400
Will you do it?

291
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,640
I will try.

292
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,240
Hey, Maya!

293
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:40,920
Kitty!

294
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,360
Kalyani!

295
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,680
Oh, wow!

296
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,800
You're looking like James Bond!

297
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,800
But don't get too big
for your boots, alright?

298
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,600
Text me as soon as the goods are...

299
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,080
...delivered. I'll do it.

300
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,240
And ch...

301
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,600
And I'll change my phone every week.

302
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,720
I know!

303
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,400
Alright, I'll get going. Bye!

304
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,440
-Go!
-Come on.

305
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,520
-Buh-bye!
-Handle them.

306
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,440
Get going and...

307
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,920
be careful!

308
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,320
And don't be scared.

309
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,800
Ma'am!
Delivery...

310
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,120
complete!

311
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,160
<i>Recent spike in drug consumption
has now spilled out to the streets.</i>

312
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,080
<i>In a recent trend,
many users have been seen</i>

313
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,760
<i>on the streets in
a state of unconsciousness.</i>

314
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,160
<i>This trend has been observed
largely in Mumbai.</i>

315

<i>But there's more to the story now.</i>

316
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,600
<i>What the hell is going on?</i>

317
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,280
<i>We're looking like fools here.</i>

318
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,080
<i>Did we really kill Nayak?</i>

319
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,000
<i>Or we helped him spread his
tentacles deeper into the system?</i>

320
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,080
Hey, Kamble! Stop!

321
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,760
{\an8}Alright, goodbye!

322
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,160
{\an8}So, Bhonsle?

323
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,360
{\an8}Want me to wait for you?

324
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,080
{\an8}He'll be back in five minutes.

325
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,760
{\an8}-We can wait.
-Fuck off, assholes!

326
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,880
{\an8}-Take him away, Kamble!
-Let's go.

327
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,840
Hey!

328
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,440
You making a comeback, darling!

329
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,280
What's up?

330
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,240
Well, I was in demand.
So, I'm back.

331
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,840
-Really?
-Wanna give us a shot, Bhonsle sir?

332
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,600
No way!
I'm gonna go to my girl!

333
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,000
I see!

334
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,400
Collecting your "protection charges"?

335
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,120
Well, you could say that.

336
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,640
Hey, handsome!

337
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,840
Up here!

338
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,120
Hey, Tipu!

339
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,520
You seem to be offering a
variety of products these days!

340
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,200
Greetings, sir.

341
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:31,960
Hey!

342
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,200
Yasmin, come on.

343
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,480
Come, sir.

344
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,720
You seem busy.

345
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,800
-No, it's just...
-Who are you texting?

346
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,880
-No, sir...
-You wanna sleep with him tonight?

347
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,200
My love!

348
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,240
Do you really think I'm gonna leave you?

349
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,080
-You're my love!
-Really?

350
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,640
-You are my queen!
-Really?

351
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,760
And?

352
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,840
I'll tell you. Let's get a room.

353
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,280
<i>With the growing conversations
about the sinister link between</i>

354
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,240
<i>terrorist infiltration and
drug movement in the country,</i>

355
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,760
<i>metropolitan cities continue to
show a sharp rise in drug usage.</i>

356
00:26:07,617 --> 00:26:10,200
-And we were celebrating out here.
<i>-It is conjectured that this is the result</i>

357
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,240
-How can Nayak not die?
<i>-of a vast and well-established</i>

358
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,680
-How's it even possible?
<i>-supply chain and distribution network</i>

359
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,920
<i>which caught police and
civil authorities napping.</i>

360
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,280
Damn!

361
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,160
There are three and a half crore
drug consumers in this country.

362
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,960
Only 2,5 percent.

363
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:36,000
I've slogged for this opportunity
for the past five years.

364
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,040
Secured tie-ups with partners
from other countries,

365
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,760
cleaned Mumbai up,

366
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,560
built a supply chain,

367
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,360
and a distribution network.

368
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,800
So that I could easily get drugs
to more consumers.

369
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,560
I wanna take the 2,5 percent
to seven percent.

370
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,560
That's all.

371
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,880
Take the number of drug consumers
from 3,5 crore to 9,5 crore.

372
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,680
That's it.

373
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,000
That's my target.

374
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:06,120
And your operation is rapidly
taking me towards my target.

375
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:10,880
You will get a huge
consignment in a few days.

376
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,040
Be ready.

377
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,840
Everything else is irrelevant.

378
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,880
I had made my decision that day.

379
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,600
You will be my priority.

380
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,480
I'll give up everything for you!

381
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,680
I think I should leave my family as well.

382
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,440
Should I?

383
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,160
Your wife?

384
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,120
Should I divorce her?

385
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,520
Why?

386
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,000
The cup!

387
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,720
If she holds it gently,

388
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,480
she loves the man on top.

389
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,440
If she holds it tightly...

390
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,320
she wants to be in control.

391
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,800
Like that.

392
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,880
But if she holds a cup from the center...

393
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,840
she loves it from behind.

394
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,800
<i>We'll always be together, right?</i>

395
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,160
<i>Forget about the future.</i>

396
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,520
<i>Focus on the present.</i>

397
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,600
Laila has had a word with the other girls.

398
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,600
We'll be alright.

399
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,440
What about the girls from Thane and Vashi?

400
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,800
Don't worry about it!

401
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,200
Our girls are smart.

402
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,040
Why are you trying to
get into our business?

403
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,080
Why?

404
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,760
Does one have to be old
to be in this business?

405
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,680
Mind your tongue, Yasmin!

406
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,360
My tongue's always been foul.

407
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,160
And I'm already a part of this business.

408
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,920
-Mind your own business.
-What did you...

409
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,320
She's welcome.

410
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,040
She can join us...

411
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,440
if she has the stomach for the risk.

412
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,360
And that should be our policy.

413
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,000
Only the people working with us
will know what we do.

414
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,240
So, if someone decides
they wanna be a little rat,

415
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,440
they'll drown with the ship.

416
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,120
Did you hear that?

417
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,120
Hey, cold hag!

418
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,520
-Did you hear her?
-Fuck off, dumbass!

419
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,760
Please tell her to be respectful!

420
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,920
Of course, I'll be really respectful!

421
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
"Ms. Mary!"

422
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,000
Will that work?

423
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,080
-Is that what you called your father?
-I'll be back.

424
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,480
Well, I've never spoken to my father.

425
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,200
Hey, what the hell are you doing here?

426
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,240
Do you think I'm a fucking fool?

427
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,960
Look at your ugly face!

428
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,160
Have your stocks fallen?

429
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,760
How much will you pay me?

430
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,040
I'll gift you a fucking mirror!

431
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,240
That should help you.

432
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,760
-Get lost.
-Fuck off!

433
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,560
Bitch...

434
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,280
Whoa! My bride for the night!

435
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,520
Your face's darker than the night!

436
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,920
And you're charging the moon?

437
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,040
Why do you show up every night?
Get lost, beggar!

438
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,840
Have you lost your mind?

439
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,160
-Dumbass!
-Have you seen your face?

440
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,960
Come here when you can
afford to pay us. Scram!

441
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,680
-You should get some face cream.
-Fucking loser!

442
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,960
Hello, ma'am.

443
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,240
Has this man come to you before?

444
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,560
He's an asshole.

445
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,680
He shows up often.

446
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,600
He's a really foul-mouthed man.

447
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,440
Has he ever hired you?

448
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,160
He's a bloody miser.

449
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,440
He just fucks with us and leaves.

450
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,920
He's never hired me.

451
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,400
Has he ever hired you?

452
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,680
No!

453
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,760
Why would I sleep with him?

454
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,880
Hey, Sita-Gita!

455
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,600
What's up?

456
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,120
So, who would you like to go with?

457
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,760
Fuck off!

458
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,120
I don't need your dusty fucking scraps.

459
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,600
"Who would you like?"
You don't deserve a man like me!

460
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,720
Anyway, how much do you charge?

461
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,840
-2,500 rupees.
-What?

462
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,120
I'm not gonna sleep with you forever!

463
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,600
"2,500!"

464
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,200
So, what would you like to pay?

465
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,120
250 rupees!

466
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,320
'Cause, that's what you fucking deserve.

467
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,000
Alright, come on.

468
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,800
Hey, I'm gonna fuck you all night.

469
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,880
Yeah, alright, come on.

470
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,480
I'll need a bang for my buck.

471
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,440
Where's that cold fucking hag?

472
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,280
I'm here for you.

473
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,920
Do you have some fire in your belly?

474
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,240
Come on. I'll give you a peek.

475
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,640
Really?

476
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,680
The rate remains the same.

477
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,320
Come on.

478
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,360
Send this video to Tipu.

479
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,040
I'm fighting a case.

480
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,320
I can use these videos as evidence.

481
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,000
Look at him go, dumbass.

482
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,120
Here's your money.

483
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,960
You don't have to pay us.

484
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,360
It's your business.
It's the standard rate.

485
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,400
Keep it.

486
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,960
Oh, come on!

487
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,920
The jackass couldn't do anything.

488
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,520
What do you mean?

489
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,040
Don't you get it?

490
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,320
What?

491
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,480
He's a bloody limp-dick, ma'am.

492
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,840
Dumbass!

493
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,520
What the hell are you laughing at?

494
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,600
Give...

495
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,760
Give me your hand!

496
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,840
Come on!

497
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,720
Enough!

498
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,240
Cold fucking hag!

499
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,760
You've killed the fucking mood!

500
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,960
Fuck off! Bloody wimp!

501
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,800
It's always the wimpy
ones who love to act tough.

502
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,480
And I've asked around.

503
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,440
He's quite popular on the street.

504
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,040
They know him really well.

505
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,400
Are you just gonna lie there
like a bloody corpse?!

506
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,760
You're not a woman.

507
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,240
<i>You're a bloody man!</i>

508
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,120
Cold fucking hag!

509
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,200
Who is it?!

510
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,600
What the fuc...

511
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,200
What the fuck!

512
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,120
Haven't you had enough?

513
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,480
Do you love getting humiliated?

514
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,320
What?

515
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,360
You're used to getting fucked in the ass.

516
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,680
Because that's all you've fucking got...

517
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,560
Bloody...

518
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,240
You had called me a "man", right?

519
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,880
Let's see who's the real man!

520
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,400
Hey...

521
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,520
Hey... Hey!

522
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,520
No?

523
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,840
Oh, shit!

524
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,600
What the hell is that? Jelly?

525
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,000
I've had sex with a lot of men!

526
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,280
A lot of times!

527
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,560
I can definitely do it, you wimp!

528
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,200
Can you?

529
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,160
Come on.

530
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,720
Do it!

531
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,840
Stop!

532
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,320
I'm not a fucking "man"!

533
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,160
And neither are you!

534
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,040
It was my wedding night!

535
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,920
Mom had dressed me up!

536
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,080
My Mom!

537
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,200
For you, you bastard!

538
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,560
For you!

539
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,240
Do you know how much I cried?

540
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,640
You ruined my life!

541
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,000
You're the bloody corpse, motherfucker!

542
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,800
You're a cold wimp!

543
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,160
You're a cold wimp!
