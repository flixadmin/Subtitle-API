1
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:21,380
One!

2
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,500
Rosa!

3
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,050
Tell me who talked to the police!
Who talked to them?

4
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,010
It had to be that whore in the market.
Please, Quica!

5
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,080
Thanks for accepting the invitation.

6
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,330
Forgive me for the hood.

7
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,500
It's for security reasons.

8
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,420
- I hope you understand.
- I understand.

9
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,420
Can I offer you something? Coffee, water?

10
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,760
No, I'm fine, thank you.

11
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,430
Let's begin, then.

12
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:19,860
- Do you regret going to jail a year ago?
- Absolutely not. In fact...

13
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:23,450
what I regret least is having escaped.

14
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:26,120
The Special Forces came in
and opened fire.

15
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,870
I couldn't risk putting my life
in their hands, right?

16
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,630
However...

17
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,130
I hope this interview
makes it clear to the president...

18
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,590
I am willing to return to any prison
in the District of Antioquia.

19
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,720
The most modest and the most humble.

20
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:48,080
But before that, I have to examine
the conditions they are going to put me in

21
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:52,810
because, look, it would be easy,
for example, for someone to rig a car bomb

22
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,730
that would explode when I arrived.

23
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:15,630
It turns out that my problem
turned into a political problem.

24
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,260
It appears that I am very important

25
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,590
to the re-election
of the president of the United States.

26
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:36,830
I will always be ready to pay for
my mistakes and accept a humble jail cell

27
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,090
when my rights are respected

28
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:45,090
and they guarantee me that I will not
be transferred anywhere for any reason.

29
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,760
Do you acknowledge that
you have committed crimes in the past,

30
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:53,020
or that you ordered someone's death?

31
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,610
That answer one could
only give to a priest.

32
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,780
In a confessional.

33
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,290
Marietta.

34
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,290
- What's up?
- What happened?

35
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:21,300
It looks like they killed them.
I think there were six or seven girls.

36
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,460
Who would do something so horrible?

37
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,980
Are you, by nature, violent and proud?

38
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:41,150
Those who know me
know I have a great sense of humor.

39
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:45,740
I would say that I'm a happy man.

40
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,860
I've always been happy.
I've always been optimistic.

41
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,740
I've always had faith in life.

42
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,410
I always sing in the shower.

43
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,660
How do you think the story
of Pablo Escobar will end?

44
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:05,460
Well... one can never know.
I can only hope for the best.

45
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,850
I would like to die on my own two feet.

46
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,770
In the year 3047.

47
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:06,250
Look behind you. Watch out for that guy.

48
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,370
That's it.

49
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,710
Smash the telephone booth.

50
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,090
Get the pipe.

51
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,170
I already know, Dad.

52
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,010
You have to get it.

53
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,510
And what's that, a woman?

54
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,680
I'm about to fight a woman or what?

55
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,930
- Her name's Nora.
- Oh, yeah, what's her name?

56
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,520
Nora.

57
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,610
Boss, excuse the interruption.
One moment, please.

58
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:34,020
How do you...?

59
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,450
What about the laboratories?

60
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:48,290
It's been difficult
to find the Moncada laboratories, boss.

61
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:51,210
And the ones that we find,
we can't get inside.

62
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:54,290
There are police checkpoints everywhere.

63
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:57,260
We lost four men
trying to get through one.

64
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,590
Sons of bitches.

65
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:03,970
And what about Judy Moncada?

66
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:09,310
We can't find her anywhere. Or Don Berna.

67
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,810
Find her.

68
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:12,980
Yes, sir.

69
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,400
And you, boys?

70
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,780
Everything is good, boss.

71
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,910
- How are you, Limón?
- Very good, sir.

72
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,740
- How are you feeling?
- Very good, boss.

73
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,580
- Comfortable?
- Thank you. Very good.

74
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,660
Good.

75
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,080
I'm going to teach you something.

76
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:37,090
There is nothing lower than a rat.

77
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:44,930
And if we let the rats run free,
the streets will be filled with them.

78
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,970
- Understand me?
- Yes, boss.

79
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,930
Give me one second. One second.

80
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,850
Boss, excuse me. It's Fernando.

81
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,440
- Tell me, Fernando.
- Your interview clearly worked, Don Pablo.

82
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,030
Palacio wants to meet with me right away.

83
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,610
You heard that, brother?

84
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:09,040
- We have to finish our little job.
- But we already finished it, right?

85
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,370
No, brother, there's still one left.

86
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,710
But you already killed all the whores.

87
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:17,290
I'm not talking about whores, brother.

88
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,710
Why her?

89
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,050
- She did everything we told her to.
- Someone talked to the police.

90
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,640
Yeah, it was those fucking whores.

91
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,220
She is someone I can trust, man.

92
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:33,480
You can trust her, but I can't.

93
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,900
Move it.

94
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,730
Quica.

95
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:45,320
I'm not going to tell you again, brother.
And we've got some shit we gotta do first.

96
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,320
Good day.

97
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:50,990
I have a meeting with the president.

98
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,580
I am Fernando Duque.

99
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,090
Your meeting is not
with the president, Mr. Duque.

100
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,420
How's that?

101
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:06,840
- With the vice minister, then?
- No, sir.

102
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:10,510
The information I have here says
your meeting is with the attorney general.

103
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:15,020
My apologies, Mr. Duque.

104
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,470
Mr. Duque...

105
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:55,560
I believe the whole world
has the right to a fair trial.

106
00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:01,980
Pablo Escobar has the same rights
as any other Colombian.

107
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:08,110
If he has committed a crime,
he must be judged and indicted.

108
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,160
He can't be hunted and killed
like an animal.

109
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,580
Mr. De Greiff,

110
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:20,670
everything you're telling me I find...
fascinating.

111
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,750
However, I don't--

112
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:29,010
I don't buckle under the pressure
of the Americans...

113
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:33,010
like Gaviria, Mr. Duque.

114
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,430
Then that means that...

115
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:42,860
you would consider...
making a deal with Pablo.

116
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,820
I am saying that Colombia...

117
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:50,360
has been at war far too long.

118
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,450
Of course.

119
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,830
The Americans are bringing in new people.

120
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:06,460
Different faces but, ultimately,
with the same motivation.

121
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:11,550
They are using us
to advance their political agenda.

122
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,640
Perhaps.

123
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:18,060
But the reality is we have to accept help
wherever it comes from.

124
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,230
And right now,
the gringos are very limited,

125
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,400
confined to Carlos Holguín
and the embassy.

126
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,150
On the other hand, Pablo Escobar
is gaining ground, gathering more support.

127
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,400
Everyone is helping him in Medellín.

128
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:35,200
- A long manhunt plays into his hands.
- Let's talk about Medellín.

129
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,380
Colonel Pinzón basically
has Escobar surrounded.

130
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,590
Do you think we'll succeed?

131
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,150
Tip line. What do you want to report?

132
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,560
Agent Peña?

133
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,750
Pansies!

134
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,940
Attorney General De Greiff.

135
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:55,570
They told me that you met
with Mr. Fernando Duque.

136
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,360
That's right.

137
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:00,110
The president was very clear

138
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,280
when he said that no one
was to communicate with Escobar's people.

139
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:08,580
Unfortunately for the president,
I don't work for him.

140
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,960
I work for the people of Colombia.

141
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:16,300
And, just like the president,
I also work for the people of Colombia.

142
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:20,300
And we are all working together,
in a united front, against Escobar.

143
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,300
- This isn't a single war--
- Are you afraid of what I might find

144
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:26,140
if I speak with him, Mr. Sandoval?

145
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,890
- Excuse me?
- Tell me something.

146
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,980
Why did you need to be there
that night at La Catedral?

147
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:38,320
Why was the presence of
the vice minister of justice necessary

148
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,780
to transfer a prisoner?

149
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:46,890
Because we're not talking about
any prisoner, Attorney General.

150
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:49,160
We're talking about Pablo Escobar.

151
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:52,000
And I was only following the orders
of the president.

152
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,170
I don't think that's true.

153
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,090
Are you insinuating something,
Attorney General?

154
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:03,760
- Are you accusing me of something?
- No, I'm not accusing you of anything.

155
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,010
At least, not yet.

156
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,100
But I'm going to open up an investigation.

157
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,440
About the allegations...

158
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,480
that, possibly,
you helped Pablo Escobar escape.

159
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:22,530
You know what, Attorney General?

160
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:26,950
Eat shit.

161
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:36,130
- What the hell are we doing here?
- Running an errand, brother.

162
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:39,800
- What errand?
- For Don Pablo, brother.

163
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:42,800
Hello.

164
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,130
Hello, gentlemen,
can I help you with something?

165
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:49,390
Of course, brother, I'm here to pick up
a package, under the name Alvarez.

166
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,560
Yes, sir. Right away, with pleasure.

167
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,980
Go ahead.

168
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,190
Brother... let's give up on the girl.
She's not coming back.

169
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,070
Are you afraid or what, Limón?

170
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:08,410
Close your fucking mouth
and do what I say.

171
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,500
Mr. Alvarez!

172
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:25,090
Quica!

173
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:27,590
This is the best toilet they make.
You really know your shit.

174
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,890
Brother!

175
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,510
That's what I'm talking about, brother.

176
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,930
Good.

177
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,890
Boys, put it in the car.
We've got some business to take care of.

178
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:42,440
I am going to take out her eyes
and make her eat them, that rat bitch.

179
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,620
- What number?
- Room three. I already told you.

180
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,740
Son of a bitch. You told me
that she was going to be here.

181
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,640
I don't know, brother.
I think this is where she lives.

182
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:21,400
She's not there.
Anyway, tomorrow is better.

183
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,820
We'll come back later.

184
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:26,070
Fuck that, brother.

185
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,950
Quica!

186
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,790
Over there, brother.

187
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:59,520
I got something, brother.

188
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:15,950
That bitch. I'm going to rip out her
tongue and shove it up her ass, brother.

189
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,540
I told you she wasn't here.
At this hour, she's already working.

190
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:23,130
- This is bullshit, brother.
- She's not here.

191
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:24,880
We'll come back later, then.

192
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,300
If the president
doesn't agree with the deal,

193
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,890
then we haven't won anything. Right?

194
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:40,480
Pablo, we have found a very good option.

195
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,020
Definitely.

196
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:46,150
If you allow me to negotiate
with De Greiff

197
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:49,240
- and create some dissention in the ranks--
- Oh, Fernando.

198
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,570
That's not why I pay you, Fernando.

199
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:55,830
You pay me to strategize
and that's exactly what I am doing.

200
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:59,500
Pablo, you have to understand...

201
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:05,170
The moment-- The position
that Gaviria is in right now--

202
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:10,920
What happened at La Catedral
was a humiliating failure for him.

203
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:16,550
Right now, he's thinking
that capturing you is his only option.

204
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:20,100
And he's not thinking about

205
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:25,900
trying to find some way
to speak with us, but...

206
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:32,610
De Greiff, he is willing to speak.

207
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:36,740
And he has the autonomy to make deals.

208
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:45,290
Fine, okay.

209
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,590
Let's try it.

210
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,720
You're not going to believe it,
but the attorney general

211
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,880
supports the legalization of drugs.

212
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:57,140
- Don't bullshit me.
- It's true.

213
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:03,980
Trust me, Pablo, little by little,
with patience, with time--

214
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:06,270
What we don't have is time, Fernando.

215
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,570
Fernando, excuse us.

216
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,490
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

217
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:15,950
- Blackie.
- Yes, sir.

218
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,780
Thank you very much, Fernando.

219
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,660
- Thank you very much.
- Yes.

220
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:22,950
Excuse me.

221
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,680
What's wrong?

222
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,010
We can't live like this, Pablo.

223
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,930
Running from one place to another, hiding,

224
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,770
hoping the government wants to negotiate.

225
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:48,020
Gaviria is going to negotiate, Tata.

226
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:53,360
He's too intelligent and too weak not to.

227
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:58,030
How are you so calm?

228
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:04,620
Pablo, if Gaviria doesn't want you in jail
then we know perfectly well what he wants.

229
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,630
I think it's time for us
to leave Colombia.

230
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:17,720
I know we agreed we would never leave,
but things have changed.

231
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,720
No, nothing has changed.

232
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:33,230
My love, we have everything we need.

233
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,240
Let's get the children
and go to some other place.

234
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:39,700
A place where we don't have to hide.

235
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,740
We're not going to
spend our lives in hiding.

236
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,420
I promise you that.

237
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:35,520
Ortiz, don't let him
out of your sight. Over.

238
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,020
They saw La Quica buying a toilet.

239
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,950
Not just any toilet.

240
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:48,200
The same one that Pablo had
at La Catedral. A Kohler.

241
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,040
We need more.

242
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:59,300
- But what else, Peña?
- Where did they see him?

243
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,630
Going toward the hills on San Isidro Road.

244
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,250
Baby, when are you coming?
You left me all alone.

245
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,590
I can't right now. It's too dangerous.

246
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:45,930
But you said you were coming.

247
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:50,100
Let things calm down a little bit.
I'll show you a good time.

248
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:48,900
Correct me if I'm wrong...

249
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,240
In the last raid,
your two men managed to capture

250
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:58,660
the president of the United States,
George Bush.

251
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:03,670
That was based on many different calls
from the tip line.

252
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:07,510
This is the voice of Velasco.

253
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:12,510
Ms. Messina, apparently
you think my men work for you.

254
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,930
You are mistaken. I don't work for you.

255
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:19,350
I decide how we are going
to work together. Is that clear?

256
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:23,860
And I already know what happened
to the last man that worked with you.

257
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,940
Colonel Carrillo.

258
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,820
He was exiled to Spain.

259
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:01,810
Colonel, General Silva is on the phone.

260
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:03,150
Excuse me, Colonel.

261
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,570
General?

262
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,010
Move your asses! The police are coming!

263
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:38,760
Get the cars and the money ready
right now. They're close, now!

264
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:40,020
Boss!

265
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,890
Boss, forgive me, it's urgent.

266
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,940
Boss.

267
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,360
It's the police.

268
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,400
They're coming up the hill.
We have to leave right now, boss.

269
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,950
Pablo. Pablo!

270
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:04,120
Sons of bitches.

271
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:06,380
They're coming from
the other side too, sir.

272
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:08,540
- What happened?
- We have to leave right now.

273
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,960
The police are coming.

274
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,210
- Get the cars ready.
- Yes, boss.

275
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,970
- Wait out back.
- Yes, boss.

276
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:15,130
Pablo!

277
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,800
Go get the kids.
We have to leave right now.

278
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:33,320
Come this way. Hurry up!

279
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,450
Hurry. Over here, through the tunnel.

280
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:51,340
Surround the house! Let's go!

281
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:31,210
They're gone, sir.

282
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:37,510
Colonel, nobody's in the house,
no signs of life, sir.

283
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,140
Shit.

284
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,680
At ease.

285
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,120
Go ahead, come in.

286
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,250
The bedrooms...

287
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:55,040
they're on the right.

288
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,810
Everything is okay, Tata.

289
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:14,310
No, Pablo.
This time everything is not okay.

290
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,820
Sweetheart, if Pablo
says everything is okay,

291
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:20,020
- it's because everything is--
- Was I talking to you?

292
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,490
I'm talking to my husband.

293
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:28,740
That was very close, Pablo.

294
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:30,750
And tomorrow, what?

295
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:33,170
Do you want your children
to watch those men kill you?

296
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:35,290
No one is going to die, Tata.

297
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,500
I am dealing with it.

298
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,800
How, Pablo?

299
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:42,970
Tell me how.

300
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,180
Negotiating?

301
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,640
Yesterday, they nearly killed you
for negotiating.

302
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:54,100
If you are going to fix everything,
fix it for good.

303
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:08,160
Don't worry.

304
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,280
Ready.

305
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:39,580
Boss, everybody is ready.
What's the order?

306
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,630
Do it.

307
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,750
Yes, sir.

308
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:48,800
- What's up?
- Ready.

309
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:50,640
All right.

310
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:55,060
We're ready, sir.

311
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:25,090
Come.

312
00:42:58,370 --> 00:42:59,960
Step on it!

313
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,260
Do it, brother.

314
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:57,600
It's cold, you fucking fag!

315
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,100
Kill him! Do it, bitch!

316
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,220
Kill him!
