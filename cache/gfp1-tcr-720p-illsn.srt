1
00:42:21,492 --> 00:42:24,085
You want Scotch? Pre-war!

2
00:42:24,546 --> 00:42:25,977
I don't drink.

3
00:42:32,241 --> 00:42:33,418
I know you.

4
00:42:33,788 --> 00:42:37,370
You have been talking to the
Tattaglia family... right?

5
00:42:38,727 --> 00:42:43,802
I think you and I can do business.

6
00:42:45,002 --> 00:42:47,461
I need someone strong like you.

7
00:42:47,939 --> 00:42:52,958
I heard you are not happy
with the Corleone family.

8
00:42:53,428 --> 00:42:56,962
Want to join me?

9
00:42:57,611 --> 00:42:59,365
What's in it for me?

10
00:43:00,097 --> 00:43:03,929
$50,000, to start with.

11
00:43:07,347 --> 00:43:08,419
Not bad!

12
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:10,858
Agreed?

13
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:11,971
Hey, Paulie, did you fart?

14
01:25:25,054 --> 01:25:27,013
- I'm sorry ab...
- It's alright.

15
01:25:30,654 --> 01:25:32,774
You gotta know.

16
01:25:32,776 --> 01:25:37,425
The hit taken out on your
father was just business.

17
01:25:38,132 --> 01:25:41,439
Look. I have much
respect for your father.

18
01:25:41,441 --> 01:25:44,451
But his thinking's outdated!

19
01:25:46,459 --> 01:25:51,240
And you have to understand.
I am a man of honor.

20
01:25:51,242 --> 01:25:54,471
I under...stand.

21
01:25:55,266 --> 01:25:56,268
Very clearly...

22
01:25:56,270 --> 01:25:57,612
I'm glad.

23
01:26:09,870 --> 01:26:15,388
And you need to be clear wht I'm
working with the Tattaglia family.

24
01:26:16,966 --> 01:26:20,752
All I want is peace.
Violence is costly.

25
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:23,868
As you well know.

26
01:26:24,547 --> 01:26:27,129
Now let's stop this nonsense...

27
01:26:27,521 --> 01:26:29,521
I want to... um...

28
01:26:31,366 --> 01:26:32,366
What?

29
01:26:34,089 --> 01:26:35,236
How do I say this...

30
01:28:49,154 --> 01:28:50,313
You ok?

31
01:28:52,745 --> 01:28:55,118
Okay, I want you to
understand something

32
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:57,037
You're Italian just like your father.

33
01:28:59,047 --> 01:29:01,088
Your father's in bad shape.

34
01:29:03,260 --> 01:29:07,234
Surely you can see that when he's
better he will need your help.

35
01:29:07,933 --> 01:29:09,840
This fighting has to end.

36
01:29:10,928 --> 01:29:14,564
You need to help me.
So we can end this...

37
01:37:39,475 --> 01:37:41,205
I kiss your hand, Don Tommasino.

38
01:37:48,006 --> 01:37:49,919
Why are you so far
from the house?

39
01:37:50,608 --> 01:37:53,053
You know I'm responsible to
your father for your life.

40
01:37:53,055 --> 01:37:54,546
The bodyguards are here.

41
01:37:55,425 --> 01:37:57,937
It's still dangerous...

42
01:37:57,939 --> 01:38:00,610
We've heard from Santino
in New York...

43
01:38:01,296 --> 01:38:03,291
Your enemies know you're here.

44
01:38:04,226 --> 01:38:07,728
Did Santino say
when I can go back?

45
01:38:07,730 --> 01:38:09,347
Not yet.

46
01:38:09,349 --> 01:38:11,886
It's out of the question.

47
01:38:15,307 --> 01:38:17,279
Where are you going now?

48
01:38:19,434 --> 01:38:22,009
Take my car.

49
01:38:23,227 --> 01:38:25,764
I want to walk.

50
01:38:28,166 --> 01:38:29,661
Be careful.

51
01:39:03,573 --> 01:39:05,443
Where have all the men gone?

52
01:39:05,445 --> 01:39:07,906
They're all dead from vendettas.

53
01:39:09,401 --> 01:39:12,367
There are the names of the dead.

54
01:40:00,504 --> 01:40:02,480
Mamma mia what a beauty.

55
01:40:11,649 --> 01:40:13,875
I think you got hit
by the thunderbolt.

56
01:40:20,725 --> 01:40:23,944
In Sicily, women are more
dangerous than shotguns.

57
01:40:47,542 --> 01:40:49,097
Did you have a good hunt?

58
01:40:49,681 --> 01:40:52,020
You know all the girls
around here?

59
01:40:52,022 --> 01:40:54,560
We saw some real beauties.

60
01:40:55,103 --> 01:40:59,232
One of them struck our
friend like a thunderbolt.

61
01:41:01,820 --> 01:41:05,207
She would tempt the devil himself.

62
01:41:05,664 --> 01:41:07,664
Tempt the devil...

63
01:41:08,446 --> 01:41:12,181
Ah, I understand... really put together...

64
01:41:12,183 --> 01:41:14,225
Really put together.

65
01:41:15,165 --> 01:41:16,226
...together

66
01:41:19,308 --> 01:41:21,548
Such hair, such mouth!

67
01:41:23,489 --> 01:41:27,119
The girls around here are
beautiful... but virtuous.

68
01:41:27,121 --> 01:41:29,809
This one had a purple dress...

69
01:41:29,811 --> 01:41:32,348
And a purple ribbon in her hair.

70
01:41:32,853 --> 01:41:36,864
A type more Greek than Italian.

71
01:41:38,769 --> 01:41:40,163
Do you know her?

72
01:41:44,749 --> 01:41:47,871
There's no girl like
that in this town.

73
01:41:50,161 --> 01:41:52,534
My God, I understand!

74
01:41:55,940 --> 01:41:56,986
What's wrong?

75
01:41:59,785 --> 01:42:00,935
Let's go.

76
01:42:02,664 --> 01:42:04,089
It's his daughter.

77
01:42:04,090 --> 01:42:05,473
Tell him to come here.

78
01:42:05,916 --> 01:42:08,593
You don't understand... it's his daughter!

79
01:42:08,595 --> 01:42:10,065
Call him.

80
01:42:30,325 --> 01:42:33,181
Fabrizio, you translate for me.

81
01:42:48,973 --> 01:42:51,636
Who is this? He sounds American...

82
01:43:37,892 --> 01:43:41,583
Come to my house Sunday morning.
My name is Vitelli.

83
01:43:47,980 --> 01:43:49,765
What's her name?

84
01:44:44,838 --> 01:44:48,565
...this is my daughter, Apollonia...

85
01:44:48,901 --> 01:44:52,030
and this is Michael Corleone.

86
01:45:09,361 --> 01:45:10,381
Thank you.

87
01:45:11,865 --> 01:45:13,011
You're welcome.

88
01:45:23,769 --> 01:45:25,707
What's the problem with your eye.

89
01:45:25,709 --> 01:45:27,063
No, no. It's nothing. It's fine.

90
02:03:43,215 --> 02:03:45,054
It's safer to teach you English!

91
02:03:45,567 --> 02:03:46,918
I know English...

92
02:03:59,886 --> 02:04:02,427
Greetings, Don Tommasino.

93
02:04:02,429 --> 02:04:03,999
How are things in Palermo?

94
02:04:10,154 --> 02:04:15,777
Michael is teaching me to
drive... watch, I'll show you.

95
02:04:16,504 --> 02:04:18,042
How are things in Palermo?

96
02:04:19,322 --> 02:04:22,194
Young people don't respect
anything any more...

97
02:04:22,410 --> 02:04:25,296
times are changing for the worse.

98
02:04:28,952 --> 02:04:34,593
This place has become
too dangerous for you.

99
02:04:34,595 --> 02:04:41,925
I want you to move to a villa
near Siracusa... right now.

100
02:04:45,426 --> 02:04:46,865
What's wrong?

101
02:04:48,231 --> 02:04:50,858
Bad news from America.

102
02:04:52,068 --> 02:04:53,610
Your brother, Santino,

103
02:04:54,851 --> 02:04:56,418
they killed him.

104
02:05:01,262 --> 02:05:03,301
Come on. Let's go.

105
02:05:03,303 --> 02:05:05,379
Let's go... you promised.

106
02:05:25,863 --> 02:05:27,442
Get the car.

107
02:05:43,895 --> 02:05:45,871
Calo, where is Apollonia?

108
02:05:46,464 --> 02:05:49,542
She's going to surprise you.
She wants to drive.

109
02:05:52,292 --> 02:05:55,377
She'll make a good American wife.

110
02:05:55,990 --> 02:05:57,747
Wait, I'll get the baggage.

111
02:06:10,685 --> 02:06:12,082
Where are you going?

112
02:06:13,193 --> 02:06:16,777
Wait there! I'll drive to you.
