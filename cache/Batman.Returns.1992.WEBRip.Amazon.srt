00:49:24,048 --> 00:49:25,310
UHH.

719
00:49:38,845 --> 00:49:40,151
COME ON DOWN.

720
00:49:47,288 --> 00:49:48,420
AHH.

721
00:49:53,468 --> 00:49:55,035
DON'T PEEK.

722
00:49:56,819 --> 00:49:58,604
YOU'LL SPOIL IT.

723
00:50:03,739 --> 00:50:04,958
TA-DA!

724
00:50:13,706 --> 00:50:14,924
[MUTTERING]

725
00:50:15,969 --> 00:50:17,144
[MUTTERING]

726
00:50:17,188 --> 00:50:18,145
HUH?

727
00:50:21,235 --> 00:50:24,151
YES, ADULATION
IS A CROSS TO BEAR.

728
00:50:24,195 --> 00:50:25,848
GOD KNOWS I KNOW.

729
00:50:25,892 --> 00:50:27,241
BUT SOMEONE'S
GOT TO SUPPLANT

730
00:50:27,285 --> 00:50:28,938
OUR
STANDING-IN-THE-WAY-
OF-PROGRESS MAYOR,

731
00:50:28,982 --> 00:50:31,550
AND DON'T DENY IT,
MR. COBBLEPOT.

732
00:50:31,593 --> 00:50:33,073
YOU'VE
GOT THE MAGIC.

733
00:50:33,117 --> 00:50:35,423
YOUR CHARISMA'S
BIGGER THAN
BOTH OF US.

734
00:50:35,467 --> 00:50:36,511
COME ON DOWN.

735
00:50:38,339 --> 00:50:39,471
MAYOR?

736
00:50:40,646 --> 00:50:42,474
MAYOR.

737
00:50:42,517 --> 00:50:44,737
MAX, ELECTIONS
HAPPEN IN NOVEMBER.

738
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:46,956
IS THIS NOT LATE
DECEMBER?

739
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,349
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT.

740
00:50:48,393 --> 00:50:51,613
I WANT YOU TO MEET
JEN AND JOSH,

741
00:50:51,657 --> 00:50:53,180
MY IMAGE
CONSULTANTS.

742
00:50:54,268 --> 00:50:55,139
HERE.

743
00:50:55,182 --> 00:50:56,923
RECLAIM
YOUR BIRTHRIGHT.

744
00:50:59,882 --> 00:51:01,319
I'M JEN.

745
00:51:01,362 --> 00:51:02,320
HI.

746
00:51:03,538 --> 00:51:05,105
O.K. LET'S SEE.

747
00:51:05,149 --> 00:51:07,107
WHAT I'D LIKE
TO DO FIRST

748
00:51:07,151 --> 00:51:10,110
IS PUT THESE LITTLE
GLOVE THINGIES ON YOU.

749
00:51:10,154 --> 00:51:13,113
OUR RESEARCH TELLS US
THAT VOTERS LIKE FINGERS,

750
00:51:13,157 --> 00:51:16,290
SO IF WE WANT
TO JUST LOSE THIS...

751
00:51:16,334 --> 00:51:17,596
NO?

752
00:51:17,639 --> 00:51:19,989
WE'LL DO IT ANOTHER
TIME, THEN. OKEY-DOKE?

753
00:51:20,033 --> 00:51:22,296
NOT A LOT OF
REFLECTIVE SURFACES

754
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:24,516
DOWN
IN THE SEWER, HUH?

755
00:51:35,309 --> 00:51:36,397
STILL...

756
00:51:36,441 --> 00:51:38,356
COULD BE WORSE.

757
00:51:38,399 --> 00:51:41,228
MY NOSE COULD BE
GUSHING BLOOD.

758
00:51:41,272 --> 00:51:44,927
OOH!

759
00:51:44,971 --> 00:51:46,146
YOUR NOSE COULD BE--

760
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:47,452
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY THAT?

761
00:51:47,495 --> 00:51:50,194
AAH!

762
00:51:50,237 --> 00:51:51,934
OH!

763
00:51:51,978 --> 00:51:53,458
EVERYBODY!

764
00:51:53,501 --> 00:51:54,285
BACK TO WORK.

765
00:51:55,199 --> 00:51:59,116
LET'S MAKE A MAYOR!

766
00:52:04,208 --> 00:52:05,731
YOU'RE RIGHT.

767
00:52:05,774 --> 00:52:07,733
WE MISSED
THE REGULARLY
SCHEDULED ELECTION,

768
00:52:07,776 --> 00:52:10,039
BUT PUBLIC OFFICIALS
CAN BE RECALLED,
IMPEACHED,

769
00:52:10,083 --> 00:52:11,693
GIVEN THE BOOT.

770
00:52:11,737 --> 00:52:12,694
LOOK AT NIXON,
AGNEW.

771
00:52:12,738 --> 00:52:14,261
THEN THINK OF YOU,

772
00:52:14,305 --> 00:52:18,047
OSWALD COBBLEPOT,
FILLING THE VOID.

773
00:52:18,091 --> 00:52:21,790
I'D LIKE TO FILL 
<i>HER</i>VOID.

774
00:52:21,834 --> 00:52:23,357
WE'LL NEED
SIGNATURES

775
00:52:23,401 --> 00:52:24,880
TO OVERTURN
THE BALLOT.

776
00:52:24,924 --> 00:52:26,621
I CAN SUPPLY THOSE,
OSWALD.

777
00:52:26,665 --> 00:52:28,188
TEACH HER MY FRENCH
FLIPPER TRICK.

778
00:52:28,232 --> 00:52:31,496
OSWALD, WE NEED
ONE MORE THING.

779
00:52:33,585 --> 00:52:34,977
A PLATFORM.

780
00:52:36,805 --> 00:52:38,155
STOP GLOBAL WARMING.

781
00:52:38,198 --> 00:52:40,026
START GLOBAL COOLING.

782
00:52:40,069 --> 00:52:41,027
MAKE THE WORLD
A GIANT ICEBOX.

783
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:42,333
I LIKE IT,

784
00:52:42,376 --> 00:52:44,335
BUT TO GET
THE MAYOR RECALLED,

785
00:52:44,378 --> 00:52:46,337
WE HAVE TO HAVE
A CATALYST.

786
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:48,208
YOU'RE DOING GREAT,
MAYOR COBBLEPOT.

787
00:52:48,252 --> 00:52:51,211
YOUR TABLE IS READY,
MAYOR COBBLEPOT.

788
00:52:51,255 --> 00:52:52,865
I NEED YOU, OSWALD.

789
00:52:52,908 --> 00:52:54,867
I NEED YOU NOW!

790
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:58,566
OH, THAT'S
THE BIGGEST PARASOL

791
00:52:58,610 --> 00:53:00,438
I'VE EVER SEEN.

792
00:53:00,481 --> 00:53:03,354
SOON,
AN INCIDENT LIKE
THE GULF OF TONKIN

793
00:53:03,397 --> 00:53:06,444
OR THE REICHSTAG
FIRE.

794
00:53:06,487 --> 00:53:08,446
HUH?

795
00:53:08,489 --> 00:53:09,534
HUH?

796
00:53:09,577 --> 00:53:10,796
HUH.

797
00:53:13,146 --> 00:53:16,149
YOU WANT MY OLD
FRIENDS UP THERE

798
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:18,760
TO DRIVE THE MAYOR
INTO A FOAMING FRENZY.

799
00:53:18,804 --> 00:53:19,761
EXACTLY.

800
00:53:19,805 --> 00:53:21,633
SOUNDS FUN.

801
00:53:21,676 --> 00:53:23,243
OH, BUT I...

802
00:53:23,287 --> 00:53:25,245
I--I MUSTN'T
GET SIDETRACKED, MAXIE.

803
00:53:25,289 --> 00:53:28,248
I GOT MY OWN THINGS
TO TEND TO.

804
00:53:28,292 --> 00:53:30,207
SIDETRACKED, OSWALD?

805
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:33,210
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE
TO FULFILL A DESTINY

806
00:53:33,253 --> 00:53:35,168
YOUR PARENTS
CARELESSLY DISCARDED.

807
00:53:38,084 --> 00:53:40,608
RECLAIM MY BIRTHRIGHT,
YOU MEAN?

808
00:53:40,652 --> 00:53:45,222
IMAGINE. YOU'LL HAVE
THE EAR OF THE MEDIA,

809
00:53:45,265 --> 00:53:48,007
ACCESS TO CAPTAINS
OF INDUSTRY.

810
00:53:48,050 --> 00:53:50,227
UNLIMITED POONTANG.

811
00:53:54,187 --> 00:53:56,233
YOU DRIVE A HARD
BARGAIN, MAXIE.

812
00:53:57,364 --> 00:53:59,540
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL BE MAYOR.

813
00:54:03,327 --> 00:54:06,243
BURN, BABY, BURN!

814
00:54:30,092 --> 00:54:32,530
STOP!

815
00:54:32,573 --> 00:54:33,618

816
00:54:47,719 --> 00:54:49,460

825
00:56:48,361 --> 00:56:49,797
 <i>WHAT</i>IS SHE?

826
00:56:49,841 --> 00:56:52,844
I DON'T KNOW
WHETHER TO OPEN FIRE
OR FALL IN LOVE.

827
00:56:52,887 --> 00:56:55,150
YOU POOR GUYS,

828
00:56:55,194 --> 00:56:57,109
ALWAYS CONFUSING
YOUR PISTOLS

829
00:56:57,152 --> 00:56:58,676
WITH YOUR PRIVATES.

830
00:57:00,678 --> 00:57:01,679
DON'T HURT US, LADY.

831
00:57:01,722 --> 00:57:03,245
OUR TAKE-HOME'S
LESS THAN 300.

832
00:57:03,289 --> 00:57:05,422
YOU'RE OVERPAID.
HIT THE ROAD.

833
00:57:18,739 --> 00:57:20,393
AAH!

834
00:57:22,656 --> 00:57:23,614
YEAH.

835
00:57:23,657 --> 00:57:25,833
GO AHEAD
AND HIT ME.

836
00:58:03,741 --> 00:58:05,786

THE RIOT SCENE.

THE DEVASTATION.

839
00:58:16,536 --> 00:58:18,582
UPSTANDING MAYOR
STUFF.

840
00:58:22,107 --> 00:58:23,804
YOU'RE NOT THE MAYOR.

841
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:28,417
THINGS CHANGE.

842
00:58:28,461 --> 00:58:30,594
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

843
00:58:30,637 --> 00:58:32,247
AH, THE DIRECT
APPROACH.

844
00:58:32,291 --> 00:58:34,859
I ADMIRE THAT
IN A MAN

845
00:58:34,902 --> 00:58:36,817
WITH A MASK.

846
00:58:40,734 --> 00:58:44,608
YOU DON'T REALLY
THINK YOU'LL WIN,
DO YOU?

847
00:58:47,045 --> 00:58:48,786
THINGS CHANGE.

848
00:59:01,799 --> 00:59:02,843
MEOW.

849
00:59:13,027 --> 00:59:14,986
I SAW HER FIRST.

850
00:59:15,029 --> 00:59:16,553
GOT TO FLY.

851
01:00:05,123 --> 01:00:06,951
HOW COULD YOU?

852
01:00:06,994 --> 01:00:08,605
I'M A WOMAN.

853
01:00:08,648 --> 01:00:10,084
I'M SORRY. I--I...

854
01:00:10,128 --> 01:00:11,651
UH!

855
01:00:20,747 --> 01:00:21,922
UHH.

856
01:00:23,402 --> 01:00:25,056
AS I WAS SAYING,

857
01:00:25,099 --> 01:00:26,361
I'M A WOMAN

858
01:00:26,405 --> 01:00:28,886
AND CAN'T BE TAKEN
FOR GRANTED.

859
01:00:28,929 --> 01:00:32,324
LIFE'S A BITCH.
NOW SO AM I.

860
01:00:33,368 --> 01:00:34,631
AAH!

861
01:00:49,123 --> 01:00:50,472
WHO ARE YOU?

862
01:00:50,516 --> 01:00:52,692
WHO'S THE MAN
BEHIND THE BAT?

863
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:56,827
MAYBE YOU CAN
HELP ME FIND

864
01:00:56,870 --> 01:01:01,092
THE WOMAN
BEHIND THE CAT.

865
01:01:02,006 --> 01:01:03,181
NO.

866
01:01:04,269 --> 01:01:06,184
THAT'S NOT YOU.

867
01:01:06,227 --> 01:01:07,968
AHH.

868
01:01:09,230 --> 01:01:10,971
THERE YOU ARE.

869
01:01:26,552 --> 01:01:29,033

01:01:31,644 --> 01:01:34,342
OH. BASTARD.

873
01:01:52,665 --> 01:01:54,319
BRING ME SOME
ANTISEPTIC OINTMENT,

874
01:01:54,362 --> 01:01:55,233

876
01:01:56,321 --> 01:01:58,932
ARE YOU
IN PAIN, SIR?

877
01:01:58,976 --> 01:02:00,020
NO.

878
01:02:00,978 --> 01:02:02,936

883
01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:29,006
I MAY HAVE SAVED
THE MAYOR'S BABY,

884
01:02:29,049 --> 01:02:32,009
BUT I REFUSE TO SAVE
A MAYOR

885
01:02:32,052 --> 01:02:35,012
WHO STOOD BY HELPLESS
AS A BABY

886
01:02:35,055 --> 01:02:38,929
WHILE GOTHAM
WAS RAVAGED BY A DISEASE

887
01:02:38,972 --> 01:02:43,585
THAT TURNED EAGLE SCOUTS
INTO CRAZED CLOWNS

888
01:02:43,629 --> 01:02:46,414
AND HAPPY HOMEMAKERS

01:02:59,950 --> 01:03:01,865
YOU'RE THE COOLEST
ROLE MODEL

897
01:03:01,908 --> 01:03:03,649
A YOUNG PERSON

01:03:03,692 --> 01:03:06,870
AND YOU'RE THE HOTTEST

I THINK I KNOW.

1081
01:10:54,032 --> 01:10:55,425
YOU KEPT THINGS
FROM HER.

1082
01:10:55,468 --> 01:10:57,253
NO. TOLD HER
EVERYTHING.

1083
01:10:57,296 --> 01:11:00,038
OH? AND THE TRUTH
FRIGHTENED HER?

1084
01:11:00,081 --> 01:11:02,910
WELL, THERE ARE
TWO TRUTHS...

1085
01:11:02,954 --> 01:11:04,216
YOU KNOW,

1086
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:07,001
AND SHE HAD TROUBLE
RECONCILING THEM

1087
01:11:07,045 --> 01:11:09,265
BECAUSE
I HAD TROUBLE...

1088
01:11:09,308 --> 01:11:12,137
UM,
RECONCILING THEM.

1089
01:11:12,180 --> 01:11:14,748
YEAH.

1090
01:11:14,792 --> 01:11:17,577
SEE, VICKI THOUGHT--

1091
01:11:17,621 --> 01:11:19,144
VICKI?

1092
01:11:19,187 --> 01:11:21,581
ICE SKATER
OR STEWARDESS?

1093
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:26,543
NO. SHE WAS, UM,
A PHOTOJOURNALIST.

1094
01:11:26,586 --> 01:11:29,328
WELL, WAS VICKI RIGHT
ABOUT YOUR...

1095
01:11:29,372 --> 01:11:31,330
DIFFICULTY WITH DUALITY?

1096
01:11:34,986 --> 01:11:38,816
SEE, IF I SAY YES,

1097
01:11:38,859 --> 01:11:41,035
THEN, UH...

1098
01:11:41,079 --> 01:11:43,211
YOU'RE GOING
TO THINK OF ME

1099
01:11:43,255 --> 01:11:46,345

TED BUNDY TYPE,

1100
01:11:46,389 --> 01:11:49,522

1101
01:11:52,177 --> 01:11:53,352
WELL,

1102
01:11:53,396 --> 01:11:57,051
YOU MIGHT NOT
LET ME KISS YOU.

1103
01:11:59,097 --> 01:12:01,186
IT'S THE SO-CALLED
NORMAL GUYS

1104
01:12:01,229 --> 01:12:03,188
WHO ALWAYS LET YOU DOWN.

1105
01:12:03,231 --> 01:12:05,059
SICKOS NEVER SCARE ME.

1106
01:12:05,103 --> 01:12:06,974
AT LEAST
THEY'RE COMMITTED.

1107
01:12:09,673 --> 01:12:13,241
WELL...YEAH.

1108
01:12:45,883 --> 01:12:47,841
I CAN'T DO THAT.

1109
01:12:47,885 --> 01:12:49,234

WHAT'S THE WORRY?

1267
01:26:46,636 --> 01:26:48,594

01:26:48,638 --> 01:26:50,248
AN EYEBALL,

1269
01:26:50,292 --> 01:26:51,597

01:26:53,077 --> 01:26:55,384
THEY'VE LOST FAITH
IN ALL SYMBOLS.

TO ENSURE THE SAFETY
OF OUR FAIR CITY,

1281
01:27:33,335 --> 01:27:35,511
DID THE MAYOR
HAVE A PLAN?

1282
01:27:35,554 --> 01:27:36,642
NO!NO!NO!
