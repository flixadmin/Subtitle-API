3
00:01:41,405 --> 00:01:46,364
This story begins in Japan

4
00:01:47,072 --> 00:01:51,322
Where the sun rises first on the earth

5
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,197
This is a rich Japanese weddingâ€¦

6
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:58,239
Itâ€™s a custom here for groom to gift something to bride

7
00:01:59,197 --> 00:02:01,989
This is not about Japanese wedding or their customs

8
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:06,072
Do you see that violin? It is about this.

9
00:02:06,655 --> 00:02:08,947
It's costs is eight lakhsâ€¦

10
00:02:09,614 --> 00:02:12,364
The reason, because it's made some kind of wood

11
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,447
You will not find this wood anywhere around here.

12
00:02:18,155 --> 00:02:20,822
But, it must be smuggled from China by sea.

13
00:02:22,364 --> 00:02:24,197
Shanghai port, China.

14
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:29,739
That wood was transported by this ship.

15
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,864
It came from Chennai travelling thousands of miles.

16
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,072
But, it must be smuggled from China by sea.

17
00:02:38,614 --> 00:02:49,072
They were loaded onto ships by these lorries

18
00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:56,530
It came from Chennai travels thousands of miles.

19
00:02:57,655 --> 00:03:04,655
The place in the world where
we can find red sandalwood...

20
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,280
Seshachalam forest, Rayalaseema.

21
00:03:21,155 --> 00:03:25,614
It is a crime to cut down trees here

22
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:30,489
This is the gold growing on earth,
it's name is red sandalwood

23
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:19,614
You are escaping right in front of policeâ€¦
Who are you?

24
00:04:19,905 --> 00:04:22,322
Get down.. get down.

25
00:04:42,989 --> 00:04:47,155
We have met after long time.
How are you?

26
00:04:48,322 --> 00:04:49,697
Hope you are doing good.

27
00:04:51,489 --> 00:04:52,655
Thatâ€™s ok.

28
00:04:53,405 --> 00:04:55,155
Why trouble between us.

29
00:04:55,864 --> 00:04:58,614
I will give you Ten thousand.
Will you leave me?

30
00:04:59,155 --> 00:05:00,280
Ten Thousand.

31
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:06,572
Bribe? Are you trying to bribe
Tamilnadu Police Is It?

32
00:05:06,989 --> 00:05:09,905
Sir, he's trying to bribe us ten thousand, sir.

33
00:05:19,364 --> 00:05:20,405
Twenty Thousand!

34
00:05:33,405 --> 00:05:34,530
Thirty thousand!

35
00:05:46,655 --> 00:05:47,822
Forty thousand!

36
00:06:02,697 --> 00:06:05,530
Fifty thousand!

37
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:26,739
One Lakh!

38
00:06:32,072 --> 00:06:36,864
I meant is one lack per head

39
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:41,280
What Iâ€™m saying is one lakh per head.

40
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,280
Brotherâ€¦ Are you Tamil?

41
00:07:15,655 --> 00:07:16,822
What is your name?

42
00:07:17,947 --> 00:07:19,114
Pushpa!

43
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,364
Hardcore Telugu

44
00:07:37,822 --> 00:07:40,614
You are a thief when Police vehicle is behind us.

45
00:07:40,989 --> 00:07:43,280
If the same vehicle is before you are a King.

46
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:47,489
You know how was Pushpa earlier,
who did rob like a King?

47
00:07:47,489 --> 00:07:49,280
Donâ€™t stay there gossiping
while you go and have tea.

48
00:07:49,489 --> 00:07:52,114
Come fast. We have lots of work. OK?

49
00:08:11,405 --> 00:08:14,822
Who is he? Is he your Son in law..
sitting as if he owns the place.

50
00:08:15,697 --> 00:08:16,989
Hey, when does the work finish?

51
00:08:16,989 --> 00:08:19,739
Bro, itâ€™ll be done. Iâ€™ll send in two days.
You please go, bro.

52
00:08:20,197 --> 00:08:23,280
Who is that guy? Sitting cross legged?

53
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,697
Heyâ€¦what is this?

54
00:08:26,697 --> 00:08:28,739
How can you sit cross legged,
when owner is asking..?

55
00:08:28,739 --> 00:08:29,864
Donâ€™t you have manners?

56
00:08:31,655 --> 00:08:32,614
What?

57
00:08:33,572 --> 00:08:38,739
This leg is mine and this leg is mine..
and i kept my leg on my leg.

58
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,739
Did I put my leg on the owner or what?

59
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:44,030
Does he want me to work or give him respect?

60
00:08:44,864 --> 00:08:47,114
You must change your behaviour
if you want to work here.

61
00:08:47,405 --> 00:08:49,030
You cant behave as you want

62
00:08:49,239 --> 00:08:50,322
Is it so?

63
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:54,072
Itâ€™s Not possible to change my behavior
so how about changing the owner

64
00:08:54,822 --> 00:08:56,072
Give me my wages

65
00:09:02,322 --> 00:09:03,989
This is enough for what I have done.

66
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:09,947
Give this to your owner and ask him to go
and buy manners in the market if available.

67
00:09:11,864 --> 00:09:12,989
Hold this!

68
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:20,197
This fellow will either rule the world or go to dogs.

69
00:09:21,697 --> 00:09:23,447
Heyâ€¦Where are you going?

70
00:09:25,239 --> 00:09:26,780
Iâ€™m also changing the owner.

71
00:09:26,864 --> 00:09:29,905
I want to see what he becomes.
-Where are you going?

72
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:43,030
Hey Parvatamma.
How many days will you escape like this?

73
00:09:43,364 --> 00:09:44,780
I gave you money during last Sankranti festival.

74
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,655
Forget the principle,
till now you havenâ€™t even paid the interest.

75
00:09:46,655 --> 00:09:48,739
Didnâ€™t I tell you Reddappa that I will pay back next month?

76
00:09:48,739 --> 00:09:52,697
You are postponing every month saying next month.
How many times should I come to your house?

77
00:09:54,239 --> 00:09:56,822
Shameless peopleâ€¦. Shameless people.

78
00:09:56,989 --> 00:09:59,572
Donâ€™t shout.
The whole Village is listening.

79
00:09:59,655 --> 00:10:02,280
I am shouting so that everyone can listen.
At least then they will feel ashamed and repay.

80
00:10:02,489 --> 00:10:04,864
She is a widow. Is that the way to talk to her.

81
00:10:04,864 --> 00:10:05,822
widow? So what?

82
00:10:05,864 --> 00:10:07,239
She has a son as grown as a buffalo at home.. right.

83
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:09,322
Isnâ€™t he a man? Doesnâ€™t he have hands and legs?

84
00:10:09,364 --> 00:10:11,822
No Reddappa, My boy has joined for work in the mill.

85
00:10:11,822 --> 00:10:13,489
He will pay whatever he earns month after month to you.

86
00:10:13,489 --> 00:10:14,530
What will he repay?

87
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,114
Everyone in the village know that
your son has left the work long time back.

88
00:10:19,155 --> 00:10:21,697
What is this son?
Is Reddappa telling the truth?

89
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:24,989
Have you really left work at the mill?
Answer me.

90
00:10:25,322 --> 00:10:26,822
I am asking you.

91
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,405
Listen Parvatamma. Forget this.
I will come tomorrow morning.

92
00:10:30,405 --> 00:10:32,030
I want you to reapy every penny ,

93
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,655
If not, this time I will not shout
standing in front of your house...

94
00:10:33,655 --> 00:10:35,905
will do it from your roof top I will shout in front of everyone.

95
00:10:35,905 --> 00:10:38,739
Drinkâ€¦ Neither son is listening nor the buffalo.

96
00:10:45,155 --> 00:10:48,114
Principle Three thousand and
Interest Three thousand six hundred.

97
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:49,822
Total Six thousand six hundred.

98
00:10:49,864 --> 00:10:51,030
The account is settled. bye.

99
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:54,114
Glad that your account is settled.
How about mine?

100
00:10:54,114 --> 00:10:55,447
Your Account?... What account?

101
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,780
Entire village got to know that we have took a loan from you.

102
00:10:59,364 --> 00:11:01,114
Now , Shouldnâ€™t all of them know that we have repaid?

103
00:11:01,114 --> 00:11:02,364
Isnâ€™t it simple?

104
00:11:02,572 --> 00:11:05,155
Hello Gurappa, Venkatadri Pushpa has repaid his loan.

105
00:11:05,155 --> 00:11:06,989
Ok I take leave now

106
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:10,072
Yesterday there were so many people at the Ration Shop.

107
00:11:10,072 --> 00:11:11,530
Who will tell all of them?

108
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:13,030
What do you say now?

109
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:15,072
Gurappa get me the list of Who all were there yesterday?

110
00:11:15,197 --> 00:11:17,405
A total of 120 people were there.

Pakala Ravi

112
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,905
Chalapathi

113
00:11:20,072 --> 00:11:21,072
Munemma!

114
00:11:21,072 --> 00:11:21,905
hey.. Stop.

115
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,697
Do you expecting me to inform all of them now?

116
00:11:23,864 --> 00:11:25,072
I wonâ€™t.

117
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,239
Kondal Rayudu!

118
00:11:31,364 --> 00:11:34,364
Listen Kondalrayuduâ€¦ Pushpa has repaid his entire loan.

119
00:11:34,364 --> 00:11:36,197
Has he repaid?
-Yes. He has repaid the entire loan

120
00:11:36,197 --> 00:11:38,614
Bainapalli Subbalakshmi, Batyala Alivelu...

121
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:41,364
Pushpa has repaid his entire loan.

122
00:11:41,364 --> 00:11:44,239
Pushpa... Inform Venkata Subbamma also.
She is leaving for Dubai in the evening.

123
00:11:44,989 --> 00:11:47,697
Hundred rupees workâ€¦ Hundred rupees work

124
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:51,030
Thousand rupees workâ€¦Thousand rupees work.

125
00:11:51,197 --> 00:11:53,364
Come fast.. Thousand rupees work.

126
00:11:53,405 --> 00:11:55,822
What is this hundred-rupees work?
And what is thousand rupees work?

127
00:11:56,072 --> 00:11:57,655
This is legal, so Hundred rupees only.

128
00:11:57,739 --> 00:12:00,364
That is illegal. More money and more riskâ€¦

129
00:12:00,364 --> 00:12:01,739
Thousand rupees workâ€¦Thousand rupees work.

130
00:12:01,739 --> 00:12:03,239
Come fast.. Thousand rupees work.

131
00:12:03,447 --> 00:12:05,739
Come fast.. Thousand rupees work.

132
00:12:06,322 --> 00:12:10,947
Thousand rupees workâ€¦Thousand rupees work.

133
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:14,989
Heyâ€¦why are you going that side? If we go that side,
there is no surety that we will come back home by evening.

134
00:12:15,072 --> 00:12:18,072
I donâ€™t have much work in the evening anyway.
So Iâ€™m going.

135
00:12:23,155 --> 00:12:25,905
Hey ... please let our parents know
if I am not coming back.

136
00:12:49,655 --> 00:12:51,405
Hey, get down quickly.

137
00:12:53,655 --> 00:12:55,697
Move on... move on...

138
00:12:56,155 --> 00:12:56,822
Move!

139
00:12:58,822 --> 00:13:00,030
Fast... fast...

140
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:01,614
Move!

141
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:06,197
To hell with this rain!
Get going.

142
00:13:13,239 --> 00:13:15,697
Bro, Is this your first time ?
-Yeah bro.

143
00:13:15,697 --> 00:13:16,572
What's your name?

144
00:13:16,614 --> 00:13:18,280
Can they pay us after the work is done?

145
00:13:19,905 --> 00:13:22,989
If the rain continues like this
We will take 10 days to reach our destination

146
00:13:23,739 --> 00:13:26,114
Be careful.
Water is flowing with force.

147
00:14:22,739 --> 00:14:24,114
Where are you all going?

148
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:29,447
We put in so much effort to flick this,
and you want to hand over it to the police just like that?

149
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,947
I have an idea.
Come here, I will tell you.

150
00:14:37,406 --> 00:14:38,614
DSP Govindappa!

151
00:14:39,156 --> 00:14:41,947
He's nightmare for Red sandal smugglers

152
00:14:42,031 --> 00:14:45,989
After he took charge,
coolies realised that life more important than money

153
00:14:45,989 --> 00:14:51,114
If anyone has to cut the trees or smuggle the goods out of
the forest it can be only after he takes a nap.

154
00:15:00,902 --> 00:15:02,652
Ey.. What are you people doing here?

155
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,944
We came to graze the sheep... sheep

156
00:15:06,111 --> 00:15:07,194
Where are the sheep then?

157
00:15:07,361 --> 00:15:10,069
Sheep have gone into the forest to grazeâ€¦

158
00:15:11,486 --> 00:15:12,944
How many sheep are you grazing?

159
00:15:14,611 --> 00:15:15,611
How many sheep do we have?

160
00:15:15,611 --> 00:15:16,777
around two hundred I guess.

161
00:15:18,277 --> 00:15:19,569
We will have two hundred sir.

162
00:15:21,111 --> 00:15:24,152
What work does Shepherds have with the axe?

163
00:15:24,986 --> 00:15:30,611
They came to graze the sheep
and I came to kill the tiger if it comes...

164
00:15:32,152 --> 00:15:35,361
Heyâ€¦ Is this the way to speak to DSP sir?

165
00:15:35,361 --> 00:15:36,402
Donâ€™t you have respect??

166
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:40,486
of course, we have respect, thatâ€™s why we hid the logs.

167
00:15:40,986 --> 00:15:43,694
Otherwise, we would have moved them out
of the forest in front of you.

168
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:47,611
Then you would have really lost respect?

169
00:15:49,444 --> 00:15:51,486
Hey what are you staring at?

170
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:54,069
Tiger is caught. Wrap it!

171
00:15:54,694 --> 00:15:57,194
Donâ€™t act smart? Where are goods?

172
00:15:57,694 --> 00:15:58,777
Where are goods?

173
00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:02,861
I thought you are man who came to catch the goods

174
00:16:04,402 --> 00:16:06,236
Didn't know you came to catch my shirt collar

175
00:16:17,402 --> 00:16:18,444
Hello Sir.

176
00:16:19,277 --> 00:16:21,194
You have just 6 bullets.

177
00:16:21,986 --> 00:16:25,027
I have sixty axes around me.

178
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,152
We will OUTNUMER you.

179
00:16:28,736 --> 00:16:31,736
Sir, Look at their faces.
They are all looking like rouges.

180
00:16:32,152 --> 00:16:33,277
Not now.
We will come back again.

181
00:16:33,486 --> 00:16:35,986
He is giving good advice.

182
00:16:36,236 --> 00:16:38,152
If you listen to him, it will do good for all of us.

183
00:16:41,652 --> 00:16:43,944
They are strong only when they are in the forest..
Where can they go, sir.

184
00:16:43,944 --> 00:16:45,819
Let's go sir...
we will nab them when they come out.

185
00:16:51,111 --> 00:16:53,486
Look like they will take out the hidden stock in front of us.

186
00:16:53,486 --> 00:16:54,861
We will lose our respect it that happens, Lets go sir.

187
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:55,069
Leaf lives on Sunlight to grow

188
00:17:55,569 --> 00:17:59,444
The Goat eats away leaves to be alive

189
00:17:59,902 --> 00:18:03,861
And a tiger hunts goat to survive

190
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:05,986
Isnâ€™t it the power of Hunger?

191
00:18:06,527 --> 00:18:08,194
Isnâ€™t it the power of Hunger?

192
00:18:12,986 --> 00:18:16,902
The tiger perishes in death
the death dissolves in time

193
00:18:17,402 --> 00:18:21,444
And the time surrenders before Kali
This is a great hunger

194
00:18:25,986 --> 00:18:29,861
The hunted knows it should run faster
And the hunter knows he should outrun his prey

195
00:18:30,486 --> 00:18:34,944
If the hunted wins, it will live another day
And the hunter knows, it should win to survive

196
00:18:35,652 --> 00:18:41,652
Life for one
May mean death for another

197
00:18:42,194 --> 00:18:46,652
Goat has to find a place to hide
if it doesnâ€™t want to be the next lunch of the tiger

198
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:16,986
A Worm is a bait to catch fish
Grains are used to trap the bird

199
00:19:17,361 --> 00:19:21,736
A piece of Meat can lure the dog into
danger Survival is the hook for human beings

200
00:19:26,069 --> 00:19:30,319
In the festival to please a god
Chicken and sheep gets killed

201
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:34,819
The knife gets smeared with blood
And even a goddess canâ€™t escape from a bait

202
00:19:34,944 --> 00:19:37,027
This is the fate of the world

203
00:19:41,402 --> 00:19:49,611
If you are not alert, the bait will catch you
You can only survive if you have a hunger to gobble the bait

204
00:19:50,152 --> 00:19:58,527
A hungry man canâ€™t see right or wrong
Only the fittest will survive here

205
00:19:59,652 --> 00:20:04,194
Goat has to find a place to hide
if it doesnâ€™t want to be the next lunch of the tiger

206
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:29,902
Somireddy- 21 kilogram

207
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:31,236

210
00:20:38,486 --> 00:20:41,069

I will be with you brother.

214
00:20:54,652 --> 00:20:57,652
What do I have with me, except this beedi.

215
00:20:58,819 --> 00:20:59,777
Who are you?

216
00:20:59,819 --> 00:21:00,861
Missing finger.

217
00:21:01,236 --> 00:21:02,486
My real name is Kesava.

218
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:05,402
Since I donâ€™t have one finger,
everyone calls me missing finger.

219
00:21:05,652 --> 00:21:06,819
What is the matter?

220
00:21:07,527 --> 00:21:09,694
Brother, do you remember muni Madhav
from that timber depot?

221
00:21:09,694 --> 00:21:13,652
He said that you will become a great man.

222
00:21:14,902 --> 00:21:18,194
I somehow want to earn lot of money
and go back to my village.

223
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,486
I think I can earn fast if Iâ€™m with you.

224
00:21:23,194 --> 00:21:26,944
what ? so you want me to become
a great man for your sake.. uh?

225
00:21:26,944 --> 00:21:29,819
I thought of myself.
But you will become big.

226
00:21:30,527 --> 00:21:32,361
How much do you want to earn?

227
00:21:34,902 --> 00:21:35,986

228
00:21:39,027 --> 00:21:40,319

229
00:21:40,819 --> 00:21:44,319
Ok, go fetch my wages of Ten hundreds

230
00:21:44,652 --> 00:21:45,736
Okay Brother.

231
00:21:46,194 --> 00:21:48,902
Hey missing thumb. Didnâ€™t you collect your money already?
Why did you come again?

232
00:21:49,152 --> 00:21:51,652
Not for me. I came for Pushpaâ€™s wages.

233
00:21:51,819 --> 00:21:53,069
I have loaded his log just now.

234
00:21:53,277 --> 00:21:54,902
Pushpa? Who is he?

235
00:21:57,819 --> 00:22:02,527
There.. that guy sitting cross legged under
the tree, and smoking a beedi.

236
00:22:04,194 --> 00:22:06,986
He is a coolie him self.
And you are his coolie is it?

237
00:22:07,611 --> 00:22:12,152
He could be sitting under a tree today,
The day he gets an opportunity He will rule the country.

238
00:22:12,152 --> 00:22:13,902
Remember that.

239
00:22:13,902 --> 00:22:15,861
Looks like this coolie fellow is showing off a lot.
-Hey police.

240
00:22:19,902 --> 00:22:22,611
Hey useless fellowsâ€¦.

241

You have twenty guns and forty bullets around you.
We will OUTNUMBER you.

242
00:22:27,277 --> 00:22:30,361
No one will survive even if one person moves.

243
00:22:31,861 --> 00:22:33,486
Stay where you are.

00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,152

Hey, they coming closer... throw it.

247
00:23:02,569 --> 00:23:06,777
If you are caught by police
no one will come to save you.

248
00:23:06,777 --> 00:23:08,402
I've pinned all my hopes on you.

249
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:14,861

255

Searched everywhere.

As a sole survivor of the gang, he runs the show now.

349
00:30:33,777 --> 00:30:37,027
If the police caught us, thereâ€™s no fun in getting gagged...

350
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:39,611
but now I see the owners themselves have turned up.

351
00:30:39,611 --> 00:30:42,319
Now I understand if this is all part of Pushupâ€™s plan.

352
00:30:42,569 --> 00:30:43,652
Hope all is wellâ€¦

353
00:30:44,069 --> 00:30:45,361
I am fine but..

354
00:30:45,527 --> 00:30:47,819
Heard that you didnâ€™t tell them whose goods
they are, even after police torturing you badly.

355
00:30:48,736 --> 00:30:49,736
Looks like you have a lot of spunk.

356
00:30:50,402 --> 00:30:51,236
Broâ€¦

357
00:30:51,361 --> 00:30:54,236
Their salary is less than 5 thousand per month.

358
00:30:54,444 --> 00:30:56,194
What will I get if I tell them?

359
00:30:56,486 --> 00:30:59,986
A broken beedi .. but you are differentâ€¦

360
00:31:00,611 --> 00:31:03,861
Are you asking money to tell where it isâ€¦
Coolie fellowâ€¦

361
00:31:03,861 --> 00:31:04,569
Jaali?

362
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:07,611
How much do you want?

363
00:31:07,986 --> 00:31:10,027
You canâ€™t give me what I want.

364
00:31:11,361 --> 00:31:12,819
just, give me five lakhs

365
00:31:13,027 --> 00:31:14,277
Five lakhs!

366
00:31:16,027 --> 00:31:17,527
Who will give him 5 lakhs?

367
00:31:17,902 --> 00:31:20,361
If we give him some nice thrashing,
he will reveal everything..

368
00:31:21,444 --> 00:31:22,402
What is that laugh?

369
00:31:22,569 --> 00:31:24,569
This guy was laughing like this the whole night

370
00:31:24,819 --> 00:31:28,444
40 Laathis broke, but the laugh didnâ€™t go away..

371
00:31:28,777 --> 00:31:31,402
finally we got fed up and stopped.

372
00:31:31,569 --> 00:31:33,027
My thrashing will be different.

373
00:31:33,027 --> 00:31:37,319
Jaali, first let him tell the stock whereabouts

374
00:31:38,236 --> 00:31:39,027
Okay!

375
00:31:39,902 --> 00:31:42,694
I will pay the money you want.
Tell me where the goods are

376
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:47,027
You wonâ€™t understand if I say, let me show youâ€¦

377
00:31:49,902 --> 00:31:53,611
See.. my hands are cuffed..
How can I show like this..?

378
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:56,694
He is asking us get him a bail..
Did you get it?

379
00:31:56,902 --> 00:31:59,527
Looks like your brother is smarter than you...

380
00:31:59,902 --> 00:32:02,861
anyways pay for what I ate and call a lawyer.

381
00:32:03,611 --> 00:32:04,319
Hey Jaali

382
00:32:04,861 --> 00:32:06,486
Are you telling us, just because we are not doing anything.

383
00:32:06,652 --> 00:32:08,319
Do you know who are you speaking to?

384
00:32:08,361 --> 00:32:09,361
Konda Reddy Brothers.

385
00:32:09,652 --> 00:32:11,361
I will kill you and burry you.

386
00:32:12,652 --> 00:32:16,319
Then who will tell you where the goods are
Konda Reddy Brother?

387
00:32:20,986 --> 00:32:22,319
Stop... stop!

388
00:32:26,777 --> 00:32:28,777
What is this? Why did he bring us here?

389
00:32:28,861 --> 00:32:30,027
can see only fields around.

390
00:32:30,361 --> 00:32:33,069
Rey. Looks like these coolie fellows sat in a car
for the first time.. go open the door

391
00:32:33,194 --> 00:32:35,027
Brother, door is struck.
Itâ€™s not openingâ€¦.

392
00:32:35,069 --> 00:32:36,361
Whatâ€™s the hurry?

393
00:32:36,486 --> 00:32:38,736
This Door! Easier to clean than to open!

394
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:55,569
Where is the lorry, Bro?
I see nothing but a well here.

395
00:33:19,152 --> 00:33:22,694
What is this? Why did you destroy the Lorry
so badly, it is of no use now.

396
00:33:23,277 --> 00:33:25,986
Do you know the value of the Lorry, Coolie fellows

397
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:27,319
Bro, give us the money, our money

398
00:33:27,944 --> 00:33:29,361
Hey, give them the money.

399
00:33:29,819 --> 00:33:31,736
Here is 5 lakhsâ€¦

400
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:34,652
go and enjoy with your brother.
have funâ€¦

401
00:33:36,527 --> 00:33:38,277
Never seen so much money broâ€¦

402
00:33:38,444 --> 00:33:41,194
Can repay all debts and
bring the buffalo back home.

403
00:33:41,736 --> 00:33:43,277
Whoever had said it, said it right.

404
00:33:43,277 --> 00:33:45,486
â€˜if I am with you, I can make 10 lakhs just like that brother.

405
00:33:45,861 --> 00:33:46,944
Hey Where are you coming?

406
00:33:47,611 --> 00:33:51,694
I donâ€™t have the habit of sticking to the women once I use her.

407
00:33:55,486 --> 00:33:57,652
Take this hundred and come in an Auto Rickshaw

408
00:34:02,611 --> 00:34:04,402
Come bro. We have an auto here.

409
00:34:04,569 --> 00:34:07,236
Hey Driverâ€¦ will you drop us at Rangampet..?

410
00:34:07,402 --> 00:34:09,027
What will be the price of that vehicle?

411
00:34:09,944 --> 00:34:10,944
You mean, that Carâ€¦bro?

412
00:34:10,944 --> 00:34:11,611
Yaâ€¦

413
00:34:11,611 --> 00:34:12,736
It should be around 5 lacs bro

414
00:34:12,902 --> 00:34:14,694
Does that car cost 5 lacs!

415
00:34:15,569 --> 00:34:16,736
Isnâ€™t it too expensive.

416
00:34:16,736 --> 00:34:17,444
Yes Brother.

417
00:34:19,736 --> 00:34:20,861
Go and buy that car.

418
00:34:22,027 --> 00:34:22,611
Bro...

419
00:34:23,611 --> 00:34:25,152
Go and buy that car.

420
00:34:26,486 --> 00:34:28,027
What are you talking bro?

421
00:34:28,819 --> 00:34:32,194
We came here in a car when we didnâ€™t have a penny on us.

422
00:34:32,444 --> 00:34:34,777
Would it look good to go in an Auto when we have so much money?

423
00:34:35,444 --> 00:34:36,777
Go and get that car

424
00:34:37,194 --> 00:34:40,444
Brother, please understand. If we buy the car,
all the money will be spending on the car.

425
00:34:40,652 --> 00:34:41,902
We wonâ€™t have anything left with us.

426
00:34:41,986 --> 00:34:43,486
Then we will have to go and work for daily wages again.

427
00:34:43,486 --> 00:34:45,027
And will we go for daily wage work in a car or what?

428
00:34:46,777 --> 00:34:50,777
Hey, I came here in car,
and I will leave only in a car from here.

429
00:34:50,986 --> 00:34:53,152
Till then I wonâ€™t move from here.

430
00:34:53,152 --> 00:34:54,277
Listen to me Broâ€¦

431
00:34:54,361 --> 00:34:58,527
Heyâ€¦ I will not budge an inch in this matter.

432
00:35:04,361 --> 00:35:06,944
Hey. Who is that honking?

433
00:35:06,944 --> 00:35:08,611
Do you think your mother owns this road?

434
00:35:08,611 --> 00:35:10,694
Roll down the window.

435
00:35:10,986 --> 00:35:12,236
I want to see who the hell you are...

436
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:14,569
Itâ€™s me. Your son from the hellâ€¦

437
00:35:15,986 --> 00:35:17,861
Oh, is that youâ€¦ Pushpa

438
00:35:18,527 --> 00:35:20,277
What are those injuries on your body?

439
00:35:20,902 --> 00:35:25,444
You are seeing the small, small injuries on my body,
but canâ€™t see the big car in front of you.

440
00:35:27,319 --> 00:35:30,069
What kind of work are you doing..?
Whose car is this?

441
00:35:30,652 --> 00:35:32,486
It is Parvathammaâ€™s..

442
00:35:33,069 --> 00:35:34,319
Which Parvathamma?

443
00:35:34,819 --> 00:35:36,236
Pushpaâ€™s mother.

444
00:35:36,777 --> 00:35:38,027
Thatâ€™s me.

445
00:35:38,194 --> 00:35:40,069
Then, Itâ€™s your car.

446
00:35:40,152 --> 00:35:44,069
But, I canâ€™t understand how you bought this car.

447
00:35:44,402 --> 00:35:46,652
Seeing your difficulty in fetching water,
Brother bought this car for you.

448
00:35:46,819 --> 00:35:49,277
Who the hell are you?
-Keshava Aunty.

449
00:35:52,277 --> 00:35:53,736
Pushpa, why did you bring it here?

450
00:35:58,194 --> 00:36:00,319
Whose car is this Maa?

451
00:36:00,486 --> 00:36:01,902
I'll go and check it once.
Hey wait!

452
00:36:01,944 --> 00:36:03,027
Hey wait!

453
00:36:10,361 --> 00:36:11,319
Uncle?

454
00:36:13,486 --> 00:36:16,027
Daddy.. Uncle has bought the car

455
00:36:17,819 --> 00:36:22,111
The one who buys a car becomes car ownerâ€¦
not your uncle.

456
00:36:24,152 --> 00:36:28,069
Did you see that car, Mohan?
Where did he get so much money to buy?

457
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:32,819
What else can you expect from a ragpicker?
Obviously through stealth.

458
00:36:34,361 --> 00:36:37,527
Hey, looks like Mangalam Seenu Brother
has come. Go and see.

459
00:36:38,819 --> 00:36:39,694
Brother, Namastheâ€¦

460
00:36:39,777 --> 00:36:40,861
Namasthe, Namasthe

461
00:36:40,861 --> 00:36:44,902
Bro, just by spending five lakhs,
I am not only got a car, am also getting respect with it.

462
00:36:46,194 --> 00:36:49,986
why are you staring like that, man?
Jakkareddy bro called us. So we came in our car.

463
00:36:54,902 --> 00:36:56,611
Sit Broâ€¦ Now we are qualified to sit here.

464
00:36:57,194 --> 00:37:00,611
Donâ€™t want, again have to stand up
when Konda Reddy comes.

465
00:37:00,944 --> 00:37:02,611
I canâ€™t give so much respect to him.

466
00:37:05,861 --> 00:37:09,361
How many loads, Subbareddy?
- Around 12 loads Brother

467
00:37:10,402 --> 00:37:16,277
How could you guys go and surrender
3 crores worth of stock to SP Govindappa?

468
00:37:16,402 --> 00:37:20,111
Donâ€™t we have anyone who can transport
the load by hoodwinking Govindappa?

469
00:37:20,152 --> 00:37:22,402
He is catching us in whichever way we go.

470
00:37:22,819 --> 00:37:26,569
It is not possible to send a load when he is around.

471
00:37:26,694 --> 00:37:29,819
Itâ€™s crazy why you are over-praising Govindappa here.

472
00:37:30,111 --> 00:37:32,319
Like a restless lady who throws in the towel with her neighbor.

473
00:37:32,319 --> 00:37:33,652
Leave it - its all beyond your ability.

474
00:37:33,902 --> 00:37:35,069
Who the hell is he?

475
00:37:35,236 --> 00:37:36,486
He is a coolie fellow.

476
00:37:36,902 --> 00:37:41,777
What the hell, Just because you came in a car
you think you earned a right to speak in this meeting.

477
00:37:41,777 --> 00:37:42,569
Get outâ€¦

478
00:37:43,986 --> 00:37:47,152
Brother, he is the same guy whom we got out on bail, Pushpa.

479
00:37:47,361 --> 00:37:48,319
I only asked him to come along.

480
00:37:48,402 --> 00:37:51,902
Are you the one who hid our load
and collected five lacs from us?

481
00:37:52,027 --> 00:37:56,986
Five lakhs are not for hiding the load Sir.
Itâ€™s for protecting you and your brothers from going to jail.

482
00:37:57,486 --> 00:37:58,986
As if you donâ€™t knowâ€¦

483
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:02,402
it is not a big deal to get beaten by Police.

484
00:38:02,777 --> 00:38:05,777
Speak if you have guts to transport the load without getting caught.

485
00:38:05,986 --> 00:38:09,194
You need an idea for transporting the load.
Not gutsâ€¦

486
00:38:09,944 --> 00:38:12,319
Yes brother.
what our people are doing is...

487
00:38:12,777 --> 00:38:17,236
Covering the load with Tomatoes and Watermelons.
They move the fruits, they see the load..

488
00:38:17,444 --> 00:38:21,777
Forget Govindappa, Our load can be found
even by a useless Gurkha also.

489
00:38:22,236 --> 00:38:26,402
We have to send the load but no one should know.
I have an idea. Should I tell?

490
00:38:27,319 --> 00:38:29,486
You want to tell us how to transport the load.

491
00:38:29,819 --> 00:38:32,402
Everyone See, who has come to give us ideas.

492
00:38:32,402 --> 00:38:33,361
Coolie fellow.

493
00:38:34,902 --> 00:38:36,277
say what you think. Say.. sayâ€¦

494
00:38:36,569 --> 00:38:41,694
is this a pickle to share with the entire world? Ideas brother...
how can I say it Infront of everyone...?

495
00:38:43,111 --> 00:38:45,986
you are asking, us only to go out..
how dare you?

496
00:38:46,236 --> 00:38:47,486
wait Jaali.

497
00:38:49,319 --> 00:38:55,111
Hey!..I better like what you say..
if not this kondareddy will deal with you differently.

498
00:38:55,486 --> 00:38:57,777
All of you go out.

499
00:40:00,819 --> 00:40:03,111
Hey stop..

500
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:06,027
check him..

501
00:40:06,027 --> 00:40:08,486
what sir.. Looks like you are suspecting me.

502
00:40:08,736 --> 00:40:12,611
After your thrashing, I have stopped all old businesses
and started milk business now.

503
00:40:12,652 --> 00:40:16,319
Yes Sir, We have taken contract with Chittoor Sweet Shop

504
00:40:16,652 --> 00:40:18,736
Yes Sir, there is milk only here sir.

505
00:40:19,027 --> 00:40:22,361
we mixed water in the milk,
now donâ€™t tell me you are going to arrest us for that also.

506
00:40:22,861 --> 00:40:23,402
Let him go.

507
00:40:23,611 --> 00:40:27,444
Give some Chittoor milk sweet to Sir.
We will go and come sir..

508
00:40:28,861 --> 00:40:30,652
Where was he hiding all these days?

509
00:40:31,152 --> 00:40:34,861
Give himâ€¦ Give him all the load and
you be around to supervise.

510
00:40:35,611 --> 00:40:39,694
I can do the complete the work all alone.
Just tell me what you will pay me.

511
00:40:39,694 --> 00:40:40,819
your rate only Pushpa.

512
00:40:41,027 --> 00:40:42,819
We will pay you what we paid last time..
5 lakhs per load. Is it Ok?

513
00:40:44,694 --> 00:40:49,027
Five lakhs is not okay.
Give me 4 percent.

514
00:40:49,111 --> 00:40:51,402
4 percent would mean 4 lakhs.

515
00:40:51,652 --> 00:40:53,236
You will lose one lakh.

516
00:40:53,236 --> 00:40:56,611
You can keep that one lakh to yourself,
just pay my 4 percent.

517
00:41:00,069 --> 00:41:01,652
What is this bro?

518
00:41:01,736 --> 00:41:04,152
He was willing to pay 5 lakhs..
One lakh is our loss.

519
00:41:04,611 --> 00:41:09,319
If we had taken five lakhs, we would have been their servants.

520
00:41:10,027 --> 00:41:14,319
By taking 4 percent, wonâ€™t we become his partners.?

521
00:41:14,944 --> 00:41:21,319
Now, Kondareddy and we are Partners..
Partner Pushpa here.

522
00:41:21,319 --> 00:41:23,736
You are very smart brother.

523
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:31,194
Hey, why is everyone looking at the sky like that?

524
00:41:31,236 --> 00:41:32,319
Looking for the sparrows.

525
00:41:33,194 --> 00:41:33,819
What?

526
00:41:33,819 --> 00:41:34,819
For Sparrows

527
00:41:34,986 --> 00:41:35,986
Butâ€¦Why?

528
00:41:36,277 --> 00:41:39,194
Broâ€¦ see that girl sitting there,
wearing a red saree?

529
00:41:39,194 --> 00:41:40,069
That girlâ€¦

530
00:41:40,152 --> 00:41:42,777
She says she wonâ€™t sell milk unless she hears a Sparrow.

531
00:41:43,236 --> 00:41:45,694
With such a big work in hand,
what is this sparrow nonsense man?

532
00:41:45,902 --> 00:41:47,194
Who is that mad girl?

533
00:41:47,527 --> 00:41:48,944
Itâ€™s my daughter.

534
00:41:49,402 --> 00:41:51,944
She doesnâ€™t listen to anyone. Even mine.

535
00:41:52,486 --> 00:41:56,027
I named her after my mother,
and she is just like her in everything

536
00:41:57,569 --> 00:42:00,486
Srivalli! Come fast...
Need to fill the tankers with milk.

537
00:42:23,027 --> 00:42:27,111
You turn away both your eyes when I look at you

538
00:42:27,319 --> 00:42:31,611
And cover your glances with your eyelids

539
00:42:32,111 --> 00:42:36,652
You stare at even an invisible god without blinking an eye

540
00:42:36,652 --> 00:42:40,569
But you are ignoring me when iâ€™m in front of your eyes

541
00:42:41,111 --> 00:42:48,402
Your looks have become as pricey as gold Srivalli
Your word has become as rare as a ruby

542
00:42:50,027 --> 00:42:57,319
Your looks have become as pricey as gold Srivalli
Your smile has become as precious as nine gems

543
00:43:05,027 --> 00:43:10,944
What Sir? Why are you pawing with Lathis?
Its only milk, Sir!

544
00:43:11,444 --> 00:43:13,027
We are a reformed lot now.

545
00:43:26,194 --> 00:43:34,277
Me, who used to lead in everything
Is following you wherever you go now

546
00:43:35,152 --> 00:43:43,194
Me, who never bent my head before anyone
Has bent my head to look at your anklet

547
00:43:43,986 --> 00:43:48,152
After having lived such a great life,
Am now making rounds of your house

548
00:43:48,152 --> 00:43:52,611
And thought it's enough
even if you look at me for an instant

549
00:43:55,027 --> 00:43:57,027
Did She see?
-No broâ€¦

550
00:43:58,236 --> 00:44:00,236
Did you see properly?

551
00:44:00,944 --> 00:44:03,402
I have seen brother.
She didnâ€™t even see once.

552
00:44:05,777 --> 00:44:07,527
I think you are very happy, right?

553
00:44:07,986 --> 00:44:09,194
for what, bro?

554
00:44:09,236 --> 00:44:10,611
because she didnâ€™t see.

555
00:44:10,819 --> 00:44:11,986
Why will I be happy bro?

556
00:44:11,986 --> 00:44:18,944
No.. you are feeling happy, eating that peanut candy happily
and saying, she hasnâ€™t looked even once.. I noticed it.

557
00:44:18,944 --> 00:44:21,069
No bro, Iâ€™m feeling bad inside.

558
00:44:21,069 --> 00:44:25,986
ok. She didnâ€™t see.
What would you have lost if you had said, she saw once..

559
00:44:26,527 --> 00:44:28,402
at lest I would have felt happy Isnâ€™t it..?

560
00:44:28,944 --> 00:44:31,152
I didnâ€™t get that idea bro. Sorry broâ€¦

561
00:44:31,152 --> 00:44:33,861
You wonâ€™t get that idea.
Why will you get any idea that makes me happy?

562
00:44:33,902 --> 00:44:41,194
Your looks have become as pricey as gold Srivalli
Your word has become as rare as a ruby

563
00:44:42,819 --> 00:44:50,111
Your looks have become as pricey as gold Srivalli
Your smile has become as precious as nine gems

564
00:45:19,069 --> 00:45:27,236
All Your friends are average looking
May be... That's why you look beautiful

565
00:45:27,736 --> 00:45:36,194
And when one becomes 18
It's not just you, any girl would look cute

566
00:45:36,694 --> 00:45:41,236
When red sandal wears a saree
Even a stone would look like a princess

567
00:45:41,277 --> 00:45:45,027
And, when a seven stone earring is worn
Any girl would look beautiful

568
00:45:45,277 --> 00:45:46,319
Bro...

569
00:45:46,569 --> 00:45:47,902
Now loading is done. Shall we go?

570
00:45:48,527 --> 00:45:49,569
Shall we go?

571
00:45:49,736 --> 00:45:50,736
Yes, Bro.

572
00:45:51,027 --> 00:45:54,402
Is that all? Should we go?

573
00:45:54,902 --> 00:45:58,152
What else? Loading is done.
So, Letâ€™s go. Thatâ€™s it

574
00:45:59,527 --> 00:46:01,527
Do you find all this funny?

575
00:46:01,819 --> 00:46:02,986
Why bro?

576
00:46:03,569 --> 00:46:04,986
You know it and you are still asking

577
00:46:04,986 --> 00:46:06,527
I seriously donâ€™t know brother.
I donâ€™t know

578
00:46:06,527 --> 00:46:10,277
You know I didnâ€™t come for the load,
but came here for that girl.

579
00:46:10,444 --> 00:46:12,361
You know it and you are still saying
that we should leave.

580
00:46:12,361 --> 00:46:14,861
Ok.. lets leave then.. come..
-brother.. brother..

581
00:46:14,861 --> 00:46:18,152
you can stay here as long as you want..
I will also stay with you.

582
00:46:18,152 --> 00:46:22,777
I will stayâ€¦ I will stay and you too stay with me,
and tell me if she is looking at me.

583
00:46:25,569 --> 00:46:26,569
Did she see ?

584
00:46:26,569 --> 00:46:27,319
Yes, Brother

585
00:46:27,819 --> 00:46:29,736
She is looking at you only while washing the vessels.

586
00:46:29,736 --> 00:46:31,694
Is it true..?

587
00:46:32,986 --> 00:46:37,152
You are lying to make me happy, isnâ€™t it?

588
00:46:38,069 --> 00:46:39,277
Yes Brother

589
00:46:40,361 --> 00:46:43,194
How can you agree so fast man?

590
00:46:43,319 --> 00:46:45,944
You could have let me feel happy for
some more time...

591
00:46:45,944 --> 00:46:49,486
I think it is better I go and
beg her to look at me instead of dealing with you

592
00:46:49,486 --> 00:46:53,069
Bro, donâ€™t do that brother
-I will go and beg her, to look at me

593
00:46:53,069 --> 00:46:55,361
Please donâ€™t do that brother.

594
00:46:55,361 --> 00:46:57,402
I know, there is no use talking to you..

595
00:46:57,902 --> 00:47:01,152
but for the last time,
tell me if she is looking at me or not

596
00:47:02,777 --> 00:47:04,152
I donâ€™t know what to say brother.

597
00:47:04,152 --> 00:47:05,486
I told you to tell me that she is looking at meâ€¦

598

and the sound of the wood below.

603
00:48:19,486 --> 00:48:21,319

604
00:48:22,152 --> 00:48:23,027

00:50:21,444 --> 00:50:25,611
Ask him to come the Temple tomorrow

652
00:50:27,319 --> 00:50:30,944
Bro, the priest said that the

661
00:50:53,777 --> 00:50:55,777

I wonâ€™t look at her ever again in my life..

00:51:47,444 --> 00:51:50,902
Itâ€™s enough for these faces. Letâ€™s go now
They paid thousand rupees only. Letâ€™s go

681
00:51:51,569 --> 00:51:53,194
Now I understood.

682
00:51:53,819 --> 00:52:00,402
She didnâ€™t see me when I was looking at her.
And I didnâ€™t see her when she was looking at me.

683
00:52:01,027 --> 00:52:05,027
When she caught me looking at her,
while she was looking at me.. she burst out laughing

684
00:52:05,027 --> 00:52:05,736
Is it?

685
00:52:05,902 --> 00:52:07,527
I know that she loves me

686
00:52:07,861 --> 00:52:09,486
Thatâ€™s why I was behind her.

687
00:52:09,986 --> 00:52:11,111
Come. Letâ€™s go and speak to her once

688
00:52:11,152 --> 00:52:14,652
Where do you want to go? Donâ€™t forget who you are..
You canâ€™t bend before her

689
00:52:14,777 --> 00:52:16,611
We should take first step in these situations.
You donâ€™t know

690
00:52:16,652 --> 00:52:18,444
Donâ€™t go brother

691
00:52:18,444 --> 00:52:19,902
You wait, man.

692
00:52:20,652 --> 00:52:22,819
Hey Srivalli... Srivalli.

693
00:52:24,652 --> 00:52:26,277
Why Were you smiling at me ?

694
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:29,236
do you like me?

695
00:52:30,361 --> 00:52:32,361
when did I like you?

696
00:52:32,361 --> 00:52:34,236
then why were you smiling at me?

697
00:52:34,444 --> 00:52:36,069
Wont I smile when I am paid..

698
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:37,777
Money?
-Yes

699
00:52:37,819 --> 00:52:38,694
What money?

700
00:52:38,694 --> 00:52:41,819
It seems you were feeling sad,
because I was not looking at you

701
00:52:42,486 --> 00:52:43,777
was I feeling Sad?

702
00:52:43,819 --> 00:52:47,319
Yes, thatâ€™s why your friend Keshava gave me
the money to smile.. so I did..

703
00:52:48,736 --> 00:52:50,361
Did you smile for that?

704
00:52:50,444 --> 00:52:54,277
Whatever it is, We got to see Chiranjeevi movie.

705
00:52:54,902 --> 00:52:56,652
It was very nice.

706
00:52:56,944 --> 00:53:00,652
After having soft drinks and Samosa
we are still left with two hundred rupees.

707
00:53:00,902 --> 00:53:05,152
Let me know where you would tomorrow.
I will come and smile at you for that..

708
00:53:05,694 --> 00:53:08,236
Is this what thousand rupees prayer means?

709
00:53:08,361 --> 00:53:11,027
Tell me where I can find you tomorrow...

710
00:53:11,194 --> 00:53:13,444
All my pride and ego has gone to dust..

711
00:53:13,986 --> 00:53:17,027
Hey Keshava. You have destroyed me today.

712
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:18,819
Hey Keshava. Where are you?

713
00:53:19,611 --> 00:53:23,652
Oh no! he's coming...
I did all this for your happiness

714
00:53:23,777 --> 00:53:26,027
Isnâ€™t it disgusting to ask that girl to smile at me
by paying her for money?

715
00:53:26,069 --> 00:53:30,902
You denied me of the feeling of happiness,
that a girl loved me..

716
00:53:31,111 --> 00:53:34,194
How can we stoop so low, to pay a girl and ask her to smile at me..

717
00:53:34,194 --> 00:53:36,736
Am I like that? Am I like that Jaali Reddy?

718
00:53:36,902 --> 00:53:37,694
No.. no.

719
00:53:39,277 --> 00:53:44,236
You have totally damaged my dignity.
Anyways, How much did you pay?

720
00:53:44,361 --> 00:53:49,194
Thousand
-Thousand... for a smile.

721
00:53:51,944 --> 00:53:56,986
Ok. Anyways since I have already become bad..
I will pay five thousand ask her to give me a kiss me

722
00:53:57,069 --> 00:54:00,402
What bro? I will pay her five thousand.
Ask her if she will kiss me

723
00:54:00,777 --> 00:54:02,027
I never thought you can behave like this bro

724
00:54:02,194 --> 00:54:04,861
Iâ€™m not like this bro. Iâ€™m a very good person

725
00:54:04,902 --> 00:54:07,986
but you have started this
and now you should take this to the end..

726
00:54:08,069 --> 00:54:08,902
what do you mean by end?

727
00:54:09,236 --> 00:54:11,652
I don't know what is the end ?
Till end . Thatâ€™s all

728
00:54:12,069 --> 00:54:12,819
Bro...

729
00:54:12,986 --> 00:54:15,486
Go and give her 5000 rupees.

730
00:54:20,402 --> 00:54:22,027
ONE thousand tonnes of Syndicate stuff!

731
00:54:26,402 --> 00:54:30,694
Approximately two hundred crores!
and halting here instead of enroute Chennai..

732
00:54:33,819 --> 00:54:37,652
What do we do with him?
Mangalam Seenu, Rotates locations instead of the stuff.

733
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:43,069
It is possible that the stock would be in Kondareddy godowns.

734
00:54:52,819 --> 00:54:57,277
If you tip us off the moment he lands new stuff,
do you know the reward?

735
00:54:57,819 --> 00:54:59,069
Fifty Lakh Rupees.

736
00:55:05,444 --> 00:55:08,444
How are you Draccha?
- Iâ€™m good Uncle

737
00:55:10,236 --> 00:55:12,569
Srinu? What brings you here?

738
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:16,611
Excellent location Konda Reddy.

739
00:55:17,486 --> 00:55:20,986
Godown is also nice.
Even Draccha liked it.

740
00:55:23,152 --> 00:55:24,236
He is Mangalam Seenu.

741
00:55:24,861 --> 00:55:27,027
The boss of the smuggling syndicate!

742
00:55:27,611 --> 00:55:30,486
There may be the likes of Kondareddy snoring
at corners to sweat small stuff...

743
00:55:30,486 --> 00:55:36,069
but there can only be one man who can single-handedly
navigate the big stuff all through the 15 checkpoints to the Chennai Port.

744
00:55:36,486 --> 00:55:39,736
Thatâ€™s why he is the one who calls the shots.

745
00:55:40,069 --> 00:55:43,694
Nobody can go against him and get away with it.

746
00:55:44,277 --> 00:55:46,944
I see that you are shifting all the load into my godown.
What is the issue?

747
00:55:47,527 --> 00:55:50,277
You know Gowrreddy right...
- Who? Our Gowrreddy??

748
00:55:50,944 --> 00:55:56,861
I dismissed him from job as
he was messing up the with stock books.

749
00:55:56,944 --> 00:55:59,861
How could you do that man?
What if he informs the police?

750
00:56:00,069 --> 00:56:02,527
He knows addresses of all your godowns very well.

751
00:56:02,694 --> 00:56:07,986
Thatâ€™s why I brought all the stock to your godown kondareddy.

752
00:56:08,152 --> 00:56:12,027
We still have some time to take it to Chennai.
Please safeguard the stocks. I hope itâ€™s safe

753
00:56:12,527 --> 00:56:19,277
What are you talking dear? Did we bring the
stock directly here without trusting Kondareddy uncle?

754
00:56:19,277 --> 00:56:21,111
But the problem is that stock is safeguarded
by that Jaali Reddy.

755
00:56:21,486 --> 00:56:24,527
And you know that womanizer Jaali reddy is
surrounded always by girls.

756
00:56:24,569 --> 00:56:28,152
If we trust and leave our stock with here,
it is like digging our own graves.

757
00:56:28,402 --> 00:56:35,027
you said it right. If Govindappa comes behind a girl,
the entire stock will go for a toss.

758
00:56:35,194 --> 00:56:38,402
Syndicate has trusted me and kept the stock with me

759
00:56:38,402 --> 00:56:39,527
You said it right dear...

760
00:56:39,569 --> 00:56:40,861
No need to worry.

761
00:56:41,611 --> 00:56:44,777
Now we have a sharp guy called Pushpa.
He is taking care of everything.

762
00:56:44,819 --> 00:56:49,444
After he came, Police are not able to catch even
a stem, forget a log.. there he comes.. see

763
00:56:49,902 --> 00:56:51,277
You are saying he is new.

764
00:56:52,194 --> 00:56:53,444
Can we trust him?

765
00:57:33,194 --> 00:57:36,444
I will tell in detail about him some other time Seenu

766
00:57:38,902 --> 00:57:40,819
He doesnâ€™t look like the one to be discussed another time.

767
00:57:42,777 --> 00:57:44,694
Anyways, I have to go for a wedding in Tirupati.
I take your leave

768
00:57:44,736 --> 00:57:48,236
Pushpa, Srinu Brother's stock will be with us for two days.
Take care of it..

769
00:57:48,236 --> 00:57:50,694
Sure, Brother
- Brother, we are getting late. Come fast..

770
00:57:50,736 --> 00:57:55,277
What did you do with Gowrreddy?
Are you ignoring him or what?

771
00:57:56,611 --> 00:58:00,361
Donâ€™t look at sky always uncle,
look at the earth also sometimes.

772
00:58:00,944 --> 00:58:04,152
We get trees from the there only..
wont you put manure to it..

773
00:58:11,111 --> 00:58:13,444
Brother, Look there once.

774
00:58:33,152 --> 00:58:34,277
No...

775
00:58:36,027 --> 00:58:41,361
He is like my younger brother.
I canâ€™t see him die.

776
00:58:52,902 --> 00:58:56,986
Why does this Mogalesh do incomplete work always ?
Get me the gun...

777
00:58:58,986 --> 00:59:00,111
Give me.

778
00:59:07,902 --> 00:59:11,652
Why do we need this garbage in our backyard?
Throw it in the forest

779
00:59:11,652 --> 00:59:12,486
Go and do that work.

780
00:59:23,902 --> 00:59:24,486
Bro...

781
00:59:24,694 --> 00:59:27,236
What is this?
-Cardamom bro.. for a good smell

782
00:59:27,694 --> 00:59:29,652
I have.

783
00:59:29,861 --> 00:59:33,152
Why delay? Where are the girls?

784
00:59:33,277 --> 00:59:34,694
They are coming brother.

785
00:59:40,652 --> 00:59:43,069
They are waiting... Go

786
00:59:43,069 --> 00:59:45,611
Go... go.
Go and kiss him.

787
00:59:45,611 --> 00:59:48,111
Iâ€™m scared. What if he bites me?

788
00:59:48,111 --> 00:59:51,111
Why are you scared? He looks so handsome.
Itâ€™s ok even if he bites

789
00:59:51,111 --> 00:59:53,277
What is that meeting they are having there?

790
00:59:54,152 --> 00:59:54,986
I donâ€™t know brother

791
00:59:55,069 --> 00:59:59,194
Why delay girl?
He is waiting since morning. Send her fast

792
00:59:59,236 --> 01:00:02,902
What is your problem to give a small kiss?

793
01:00:02,902 --> 01:00:05,277
If you canâ€™t.. I will go and give him. Tell me

794
01:00:05,277 --> 01:00:08,402
You wait, As If we canâ€™t do that.

795
01:00:08,402 --> 01:00:10,819
Bro Should I come and give you the kiss?

796
01:00:11,027 --> 01:00:15,569
Who is that? Calling me brother and offering me a kiss.

797
01:00:15,861 --> 01:00:17,527
Where did you find them?

798
01:00:17,986 --> 01:00:20,361
Stop those discussions and send her fast

799
01:00:20,361 --> 01:00:22,444
I am feeling scared
-Shut up and come.

800
01:00:23,152 --> 01:00:26,319
She is coming bro.. she is Coming
I can't do it.

801
01:00:26,694 --> 01:00:29,444
He is asking for a small kiss.
We should have thought of it, when we took the money..

802
01:00:34,361 --> 01:00:35,986
Keshava, close the door

803
01:00:36,152 --> 01:00:37,777
No, keep it open

804
01:00:38,319 --> 01:00:40,319
What are you doing here dirty fellow?

805
01:00:41,569 --> 01:00:45,152
Iâ€™m noticing you since long.
Why are you shouting? Stop those antics..

806
01:00:45,152 --> 01:00:46,402
I will slap you hard idiot

807
01:00:46,444 --> 01:00:50,111
Do it fast Pushpa and letâ€™s go.
Girls, turn away.

808
01:00:51,402 --> 01:00:53,986
Okay dear, as you wish!
- No touching!

809
01:00:54,819 --> 01:00:55,902
Oh no!

810
01:00:58,236 --> 01:00:59,861
What is that?

811
01:01:01,486 --> 01:01:03,277
Cardamom... you want?

812
01:01:03,611 --> 01:01:05,736
Not there. I will kiss you here

813
01:01:06,152 --> 01:01:07,319
Here?
- Yes

814
01:01:07,402 --> 01:01:10,319
Why should we pay so much for a kiss here?
Hey Keshava

815
01:01:10,402 --> 01:01:12,486
Ok ok. Donâ€™t make it an issue..

816
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:15,152
Okay.

817
01:01:17,069 --> 01:01:17,819
Ok give me..

818
01:01:17,902 --> 01:01:19,444
Talk something.

819
01:01:19,444 --> 01:01:24,486
What is there to talk? You took money to kiss me.
Right.. so kiss me..

820
01:01:36,736 --> 01:01:38,611
Why are you crying girl?.. why?

821
01:01:38,611 --> 01:01:45,194
I thought it is easy when my friends told me.
But my heart isnâ€™t agreeing.

822
01:01:45,611 --> 01:01:48,902
First kiss....

823
01:01:49,111 --> 01:01:54,069
How will I understand if you murmur? Say it clearly

824
01:01:54,194 --> 01:01:57,736
I always wanted to give first kiss to my husband...

825
01:01:57,819 --> 01:02:01,111
If you wanted to give it to your husband or someone,

826
01:02:01,111 --> 01:02:04,611
why did you take money from me?
And why are you crying now?

827
01:02:04,694 --> 01:02:07,486
Stop crying... Stop it

828
01:02:08,236 --> 01:02:09,861
why are you crying now?

829
01:02:09,944 --> 01:02:11,486
What happened dear? My god

830
01:02:11,569 --> 01:02:12,402
What did you do brother?

831
01:02:12,444 --> 01:02:16,361
I didnâ€™t do anything brother. I didnâ€™t even touch her
-What did you do? Why is the poor girl crying so much?

832
01:02:16,527 --> 01:02:20,069
Ask Srivalli.
Hey Srivalli. Did I do anything to you?

833
01:02:20,402 --> 01:02:22,319
we trusted and sent our friend
and is that what you do to her?

834
01:02:22,402 --> 01:02:23,527
Stop your nuisance for a minute

835
01:02:23,611 --> 01:02:26,819
I didnâ€™t do anything brother.
Tell them that I didnâ€™t do anything

836
01:02:27,277 --> 01:02:29,444
(Indistinct Voices)

837
01:02:32,277 --> 01:02:34,069
She is making ruckus here.

838
01:02:34,736 --> 01:02:37,319
Leave it bro. She said she will kiss her husband only right

839
01:02:37,486 --> 01:02:40,319
Itâ€™s my kiss man. I paid for it.

840
01:02:40,944 --> 01:02:44,569
If I have to marry her and become her husband, I will.
I should only get that kiss..

841
01:02:44,944 --> 01:02:47,819
I wonâ€™t compromise on this

842
01:02:55,986 --> 01:02:58,861
Hey what is this? The entire stock is still here.

843
01:02:58,861 --> 01:03:01,736
Didnâ€™t I tell you that we must cross
the check post with this by the night?

844
01:03:01,777 --> 01:03:04,027
Jalanna was partying the whole night.

845
01:03:04,152 --> 01:03:08,402
He has stopped the lorries as they might disturb the party.

846
01:03:08,527 --> 01:03:13,069
have your brains gone dead?
Who is Jaali to stop the stock the stock movement?

847
01:03:13,944 --> 01:03:17,402
Police are observing us like Jackals for this
address since night,

848
01:03:17,402 --> 01:03:18,736
and you know how risky it is..

849
01:03:19,569 --> 01:03:22,152
Where are the keys?

850
01:03:22,194 --> 01:03:24,652
That is Jalannaâ€™s room.
He will kill if we give you the keys

851
01:03:24,736 --> 01:03:26,152
What will he do?

852
01:03:27,569 --> 01:03:29,569
Pushpa, What are you doing?

853
01:03:48,652 --> 01:03:49,986
Hey Keshav,
-Bro...

854
01:03:50,861 --> 01:03:53,986
please ask our guys to drop her in the village safely.

855
01:03:53,986 --> 01:03:54,569
Okay.

856
01:03:54,736 --> 01:03:55,569
Go...

857
01:04:02,236 --> 01:04:03,611
Hey, do it fast.

858
01:04:03,652 --> 01:04:05,611
Pushpa has sent the girl home

859
01:04:05,777 --> 01:04:08,319
We are packing A grade stock into a different lorry

860
01:04:08,361 --> 01:04:09,986
Why did you send the girl?

861
01:04:10,194 --> 01:04:12,819
First tell me why you didnâ€™t you send the stock.

862
01:04:12,819 --> 01:04:15,444
Have you converted the godown into....?

863
01:04:15,486 --> 01:04:19,652
Who are you to ask me? This is my godown
you are just a daily wages idiot

864
01:04:19,652 --> 01:04:22,527
How dare you call me daily wage worker?
-Hey wait.

865
01:04:22,736 --> 01:04:26,986
This is Pushpa.
Partner Pushpa. 4 Percent share.

866
01:04:27,361 --> 01:04:28,361
Give it now

867
01:04:28,569 --> 01:04:29,652
Here, brother.

868
01:04:29,902 --> 01:04:32,319
Pushpa, Kondareddy brother wants to speak to you

869
01:04:34,652 --> 01:04:37,402
Donâ€™t you use what you have above neck
instead of what you have below the waist?

870
01:04:38,569 --> 01:04:40,194
Bro, please tell

871
01:04:40,652 --> 01:04:44,194
Police have come to know our godown address

872
01:04:45,986 --> 01:04:47,611
What are you saying brother?

873
01:04:52,611 --> 01:04:54,069
Hope all the stock is cleared from the godown

874
01:04:54,111 --> 01:04:57,986
No brother. Your brother Jaali has
stopped all lorries from entering the godown

875
01:04:58,944 --> 01:05:03,986
My god! Thousand tons stock. It is worth 250 crores.
We will be done forever if we are caught.

876
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:08,611
Mangalam Srinu has trusted us and handed over the stock.

877
01:05:11,777 --> 01:05:12,986
Somehow you take care

878
01:05:13,027 --> 01:05:15,027
You have trusted me and handed over to me..

879
01:05:15,027 --> 01:05:17,402
consider Pushpa is dead, if even one log is caught..

880
01:05:19,236 --> 01:05:21,486
How scared he is, the slave!

881
01:05:21,486 --> 01:05:25,319
How dare you, youâ€™ll get it now!
Doesnâ€™t budge an inch, always gives it back!

882
01:05:28,777 --> 01:05:31,569
How do we tackle this?

883
01:05:50,736 --> 01:05:51,777
Okay bro.

884
01:05:51,777 --> 01:05:53,819
Rey... Pick the stock and throw it in the stream.

885
01:05:54,986 --> 01:05:59,569
What are you looking at? Police are coming.
Get up and move

886
01:07:16,652 --> 01:07:19,236
Brother, 250 crores of worth stock,
listen to me.

887
01:07:19,236 --> 01:07:20,736
Entire stock is being thrown into water here.

888
01:07:20,736 --> 01:07:22,486
Mangalam Srinu Stock is also there in that.

889
01:07:23,111 --> 01:07:26,944
We can put it on Pushpa if Govindappa catches it.

890
01:07:27,111 --> 01:07:29,486
Not good for you to be there now.
Leave from there immediately

891
01:09:27,902 --> 01:09:30,236
This fellow Pushpa is caught now.
Srinu will not leave him.

892
01:09:30,277 --> 01:09:31,319
I am sure his time is over now..

893
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:44,361
Police are here.

894
01:09:44,527 --> 01:09:47,361
Brother...Log

895
01:10:14,736 --> 01:10:17,694
Sir, here the money.. take this
and close the gates immediately

896
01:10:24,611 --> 01:10:25,777
Come fast.

897
01:10:38,986 --> 01:10:40,361
Quickly.

898
01:10:57,152 --> 01:10:58,402
Come Quickly

899
01:11:10,777 --> 01:11:15,902
Sir, They have put towers in the entire forest.
They would have known the information by now

900
01:11:18,444 --> 01:11:22,527
Rey...Is stock there?
- Sir, nothing is there here. Total license wood

901
01:11:22,611 --> 01:11:25,861
If Pushpa is there stock will not be there.
If stock is there Pushpa wonâ€™t be there.

902
01:11:26,194 --> 01:11:29,652
If you want to see both together,
none of you will be there.

903
01:11:30,152 --> 01:11:34,277
We should all be thankful to Govindappa Sir!
- Yes Bro.

904
01:11:34,444 --> 01:11:37,111
Our range has grown because of this sir only...

905
01:11:37,194 --> 01:11:40,986
If he had caught the stock that day,
I wouldnâ€™t have become a partner today..

906
01:11:41,194 --> 01:11:43,986
Donâ€™t say like that brother? Sir may get angry

907
01:11:45,569 --> 01:11:47,527
What sir? Are you getting angry??

908
01:11:47,986 --> 01:11:51,486
Alas... I donâ€™t even have shirt for you to hold my collar.

909
01:11:51,694 --> 01:11:56,236
I have given it to a girl just now.
Not just you sir, we also do good deeds

910
01:11:56,277 --> 01:11:59,402
Rey... You are not understanding what you are doing...

911
01:12:01,152 --> 01:12:02,611
You are more cruel than animals... Yak

912
01:12:03,069 --> 01:12:05,319
What is crueler than this world sir?

913
01:12:06,277 --> 01:12:09,986
This world has given a gun to your hand
and an axe to my hand.

914
01:12:10,527 --> 01:12:12,152
Everyone has his own war to fight.

915
01:12:14,527 --> 01:12:18,194
I have won this war also sir

916
01:12:19,111 --> 01:12:21,069
I will take care of whatever comes.

917
01:12:27,569 --> 01:12:30,361
Yes, You have won.

918
01:12:31,944 --> 01:12:34,069
But do you know what kind of war you are fighting?

919
01:12:35,486 --> 01:12:40,444
You will lose as much as you are winning today.
You will know as you age..

920
01:12:48,611 --> 01:12:51,361
Losers will always talk about principles.

921
01:12:52,819 --> 01:12:53,861
When does the party start?

922
01:12:55,861 --> 01:12:59,944
Heard about Mangalam Srinu party,
but first time I am seeing it.

923
01:13:00,277 --> 01:13:04,236
Not only smugglers but police,
politicians all have come to party.

924
01:13:04,736 --> 01:13:08,444
When one saw so much money
Pushpa has become hero instantly.

925
01:13:08,694 --> 01:13:12,402
Mangalam Srinu himself personally introduced him to MP

926
01:13:15,902 --> 01:13:19,402
They kill me with their looks if I wear a saree

927
01:13:19,652 --> 01:13:23,277
They scan me with their eyes if I wear a skirt

928
01:13:23,402 --> 01:13:27,069
Forget saree and gown, let me divulge a secret

929
01:13:27,194 --> 01:13:30,902
What is there in the dress when Itâ€™s your hold that matters

930
01:13:30,902 --> 01:13:34,486
Will you say yes Dear.
Will you say No

931
01:13:38,444 --> 01:13:42,027
Will you say yes Dear.
Will you say No

932
01:13:45,902 --> 01:13:49,444
One becomes upside down if Iâ€™m fair

933
01:13:49,652 --> 01:13:53,236
One creates uproar if Iâ€™m dark

934
01:13:53,402 --> 01:13:57,027
Forget fair and dark, let me reveal the true color

935
01:13:57,152 --> 01:14:00,819
Color and figure wonâ€™t matter once you enter the field

936
01:14:00,861 --> 01:14:04,444
Will you say yes Dear.
Will you say No

937
01:14:08,361 --> 01:14:11,944
Will you say yes Dear.
Will you say No

938
01:14:30,819 --> 01:14:34,277
One jumps with joy If Iâ€™m tall

939
01:14:34,736 --> 01:14:38,111
One shouts and wails if Iâ€™m short

940
01:14:38,486 --> 01:14:41,944
Forget tall and short, let me tell you a truth

941
01:14:41,986 --> 01:14:45,902
There wonâ€™t be ups and
downs once you get intoxicated

942
01:14:46,027 --> 01:14:49,611
Will you say yes Dear.
Will you say No

943
01:14:53,319 --> 01:14:56,902
Will you say yes Dear.
Or will you say No

944
01:15:00,861 --> 01:15:04,319
One feels happy If I'm stout

945
01:15:04,486 --> 01:15:08,069
One feel bliss If I'm slender

946
01:15:08,236 --> 01:15:11,986
Forget stout and slender

947
01:15:11,986 --> 01:15:15,777
It is the man's wicked nature who caught me alone.

948
01:15:15,902 --> 01:15:19,486
Will you say yes Dear.
Will you say No

949
01:15:23,402 --> 01:15:26,986
Will you say yes Dear.
Will you say No

950
01:15:53,277 --> 01:15:56,861
One person poses like a respected man...

951
01:15:56,861 --> 01:16:00,694
I have a very good heart says one person

952
01:16:00,944 --> 01:16:04,652
There is no good or bad, everyone belongs to the same race

953
01:16:04,652 --> 01:16:07,069
when the lights are off...

954
01:16:11,986 --> 01:16:15,736
when the lights are off...

955
01:16:15,777 --> 01:16:19,361
Will you say yes Dear.
Will you say No

956
01:16:23,194 --> 01:16:26,777
Will you say yes Dear.
Will you say No

957
01:16:38,236 --> 01:16:42,361
Will you say yes Dear.
Will you say No

958
01:16:44,694 --> 01:16:48,194
Mangalam Sreenu has arranged a super party

959
01:16:48,986 --> 01:16:52,736
He will get 2 crores from us and
give only 25 lakhs to them

960
01:16:53,027 --> 01:16:55,652
Then, not only party, he can do anything.

961
01:16:56,444 --> 01:16:57,902
Figure, liquor...

962
01:17:04,986 --> 01:17:09,444
Brother, I want to speak to you urgently.
- What is that?

963
01:17:13,694 --> 01:17:19,444
That Mangalam srinu is cheating us bro.
Mangalam srinu is fooling us.

964
01:17:19,777 --> 01:17:23,402
How much does he give us per ton?
Twenty-five lakhs right.

965
01:17:23,736 --> 01:17:26,194
He is selling for Two crores outside..

966
01:17:27,902 --> 01:17:29,527
How do you know?

967
01:17:30,486 --> 01:17:35,777
I have heard from the Murugan's people
when they were talking to each other

968
01:17:37,694 --> 01:17:40,819
Of late I was also getting doubt on him...

969
01:17:40,819 --> 01:17:45,736
He is buying lands in lot of places.
What do you say now?

970
01:17:45,986 --> 01:17:48,402
Nothing to say. Letâ€™s go and ask

971
01:17:48,402 --> 01:17:50,527
We are loosing so much bro.

972
01:17:50,527 --> 01:17:54,069
We are all working hard and he is sitting and
enjoying all the fruits. Ask him Brother

973
01:17:54,069 --> 01:17:56,736
What? you want to go and ask Mangalam Srinu is it?

974
01:17:56,736 --> 01:17:59,152
Yes
-Do you know what he is?

975
01:17:59,236 --> 01:18:00,861
Hey Stop... You stop.

976
01:18:01,569 --> 01:18:07,777
You can go and ask but there are lot of other things
between me and Srinu.

977
01:18:08,194 --> 01:18:10,902
We will get into trouble if anything goes wrong.

978
01:18:11,777 --> 01:18:14,444
What is this? Go and get Vadas..

979
01:18:15,777 --> 01:18:17,361
Do one thing man.

980
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:22,236
You go and ask him that people are talking like this outside.

981
01:18:22,361 --> 01:18:23,902
You are also partner right.

982
01:18:24,736 --> 01:18:28,069
If he agrees 50% share...

983
01:18:28,861 --> 01:18:32,611
else, you didnâ€™t ask me anything.
There is no relationship between us.

984
01:18:33,736 --> 01:18:34,736
What do you say?

985
01:18:36,527 --> 01:18:37,736
No Brother.

986
01:18:38,027 --> 01:18:41,736
If anyone has to ask him, it is you brother.
It wonâ€™t look good if I ask

987
01:18:41,944 --> 01:18:43,152
Thatâ€™s why...

988
01:18:44,486 --> 01:18:47,361
Hey Muniratnam did you see Pushpaâ€™s range.

989
01:18:47,694 --> 01:18:49,944
He is having lunch with Kondareddy...
and he also doing business with him

990
01:18:49,986 --> 01:18:53,236
You said it right.He used to come to work for
a wage of hundred, hundred and fifty.

991
01:18:53,236 --> 01:18:54,861
Now he has become very big

992
01:18:55,152 --> 01:18:59,111
Where will you get a better match
for your daughter than him.

993
01:18:59,111 --> 01:19:00,319
Why donâ€™t you get her married to our guy?

994
01:19:00,944 --> 01:19:04,152
How did you say such a big thing
so easily in a serious discussion?

995
01:19:04,486 --> 01:19:07,152
How can I give my daughter
without knowing his caste and gotra?

996
01:19:07,402 --> 01:19:08,944
Hello... Do you know who he is?

997
01:19:08,944 --> 01:19:10,819
He is younger son of Molleti Venkata Ramayya

998
01:19:10,944 --> 01:19:13,277
Is that so? Then he is our own.

999
01:19:13,527 --> 01:19:14,569
Good match

1000
01:19:20,444 --> 01:19:22,069
Namaste!

1001
01:19:22,069 --> 01:19:24,027
See, How Muniratnam face is glowing

1002
01:19:24,111 --> 01:19:27,111
Our lives are such that we feel happy
if Molleti Venkataramana says hi to us.

1003
01:19:27,569 --> 01:19:30,277
A match with such family meansâ€¦
Its all god grace

1004
01:19:30,444 --> 01:19:31,319
Here!

1005
01:19:34,069 --> 01:19:35,611
What are you looking at?
Move...

1006
01:19:35,611 --> 01:19:36,194
come in please.

1007
01:19:36,194 --> 01:19:37,861
Sit... please sit down.

1008
01:19:37,986 --> 01:19:39,444
Hey, you go.

1009
01:19:39,444 --> 01:19:41,319
What did you guys tell him?
He is talking strangely

1010
01:19:41,319 --> 01:19:42,694
What did you say?

1011
01:19:42,902 --> 01:19:45,819
Thatâ€™s what Bro. I told him that you are
third son of Molleti Venkataramana.

1012
01:19:45,819 --> 01:19:47,194
Did you say like that?

1013
01:19:47,527 --> 01:19:49,902
Iâ€™m somehow getting scared

1014
01:19:49,902 --> 01:19:52,444
Whatâ€™s wrong? Did he not tell what the truth is..?

1015
01:19:52,444 --> 01:19:53,986
Not like that my son
-Be silent Mom.

1016
01:19:54,152 --> 01:19:55,236
(Chants)

1017
01:19:58,861 --> 01:20:00,569
Bro, Srivalli is coming...

1018
01:20:00,736 --> 01:20:02,069
Bring the girl.

1019
01:20:03,611 --> 01:20:04,694
(Chants)

1020
01:20:28,486 --> 01:20:29,902
The girl is looking beautiful.

1021
01:20:29,986 --> 01:20:32,111
Girl, I had told you earlier only.
It was just a small kiss.

1022
01:20:32,111 --> 01:20:33,944
You should have given it to him.
See it has come up to marriage.

1023
01:20:33,944 --> 01:20:36,527
Now you have to keep kissing him for life.
That too for free.

1024
01:20:44,902 --> 01:20:46,236
You...!

1025
01:20:47,861 --> 01:20:51,277
Pushparaj, the youngest son of
Rangampet resident Molleti Venkata Ramana

1026
01:20:51,277 --> 01:20:54,694
and the resident of Yarravaripalem villageâ€¦

1027
01:20:54,694 --> 01:20:57,944
We have seen the people
who sell fruits in the name of the tree.

1028
01:20:57,944 --> 01:21:03,569
We came here knowing that someone is selling fruits
without even know which tree has given those fruits

1029
01:21:05,319 --> 01:21:06,902
They are Venkataramanaâ€™s sons.

1030
01:21:07,902 --> 01:21:08,944
Greetings Sir.

1031
01:21:08,944 --> 01:21:12,736
It is said that relationship means it has
to have 7 decades both sides

1032
01:21:12,736 --> 01:21:14,569
Why is it that you are not looking
at even to one generation?

1033
01:21:15,194 --> 01:21:17,361
Do you know to whom you are giving
your daughter for marriage?

1034
01:21:17,527 --> 01:21:18,652
What are saying sir?

1035
01:21:18,736 --> 01:21:21,152
He said he is third son of Molleti Venkata Ramana.

1036
01:21:21,236 --> 01:21:22,569
Isnâ€™t he your younger brother?

1037
01:21:23,319 --> 01:21:25,444
Will someone become king just because
he has Raju in his name?

1038
01:21:25,444 --> 01:21:27,402
and my brother if he takes my fatherâ€™s name?

1039
01:21:27,527 --> 01:21:29,444
He is anyways shameless to say it.

1040
01:21:29,819 --> 01:21:32,402
She is a lady shouldnâ€™t she have any shame ?

1041
01:21:33,902 --> 01:21:36,902
Son, you sit quietly.
Swear on me that you wonâ€™t get up

1042
01:21:37,736 --> 01:21:39,902
Ey. Give me that Ration card

1043
01:21:42,319 --> 01:21:48,194
Have you seen what is in that?
Did you see any surname?

1044
01:21:48,444 --> 01:21:51,861
No Sir, its only written as Pushpa raju

1045
01:21:52,236 --> 01:21:53,444
Thatâ€™s the story.

1046
01:21:53,736 --> 01:21:57,194
He is surviving by using our surname

1047
01:21:59,486 --> 01:22:01,902
So what if he doesnâ€™t have surname,
what is it that Pushpa doesnâ€™t have..?

1048
01:22:01,902 --> 01:22:05,569
He has a house and earns handful.
Isnâ€™t it enough to take care of your girl?

1049
01:22:05,819 --> 01:22:06,694
What do you say Muniratnam?

1050
01:22:06,694 --> 01:22:07,736
You said it rightly

1051
01:22:07,736 --> 01:22:08,569
what will he take care?

1052
01:22:08,569 --> 01:22:10,736
Do you think wedding is just exchanging vows?

1053
01:22:11,027 --> 01:22:13,361
We get a girl married to change her surname.

1054
01:22:13,569 --> 01:22:16,236
I wonâ€™t send her to such house.

1055
01:22:16,444 --> 01:22:17,236
Get up dear.

1056
01:22:17,236 --> 01:22:19,527
You wait... listen to me.

1057
01:22:19,527 --> 01:22:21,027
You sit my dear. Sit.

1058
01:22:23,069 --> 01:22:26,402
Hey Son, you both are brothers and you share the same blood..

1059
01:22:26,652 --> 01:22:30,986
when such good occasions are happening,
one should overlook and move on.

1060
01:22:31,861 --> 01:22:32,944
I agree with you

1061
01:22:33,236 --> 01:22:35,861
I agree that my father had an affair with his mother.

1062
01:22:35,861 --> 01:22:39,111
But what is the guarantee that he is born to my father?

1063
01:22:44,902 --> 01:22:46,611
My father didnâ€™t tell me.

1064
01:22:48,444 --> 01:22:49,444
What man?

1065
01:22:49,527 --> 01:22:51,861
Did your mother at least tell you to
whom you are born? What?

1066
01:22:51,861 --> 01:22:53,069
How dare you?

1067
01:22:57,694 --> 01:23:00,611
(Commotion)

1068
01:23:02,986 --> 01:23:05,902
(Commotion)

1069
01:23:15,611 --> 01:23:16,527
Mom!

1070
01:23:18,902 --> 01:23:19,819
Mom!

1071
01:23:22,152 --> 01:23:23,069
Mom!

1072
01:23:27,652 --> 01:23:29,486
Keshava, get the vehicle.

1073
01:23:53,652 --> 01:23:54,694
Throw her out!

1074
01:23:55,319 --> 01:23:57,944
Please leave me... Please

1075
01:24:15,861 --> 01:24:18,569
Please... let me see his face once.

1076
01:24:57,527 --> 01:24:58,152
Mom!

1077
01:24:58,527 --> 01:24:59,152
Mom!

1078
01:24:59,319 --> 01:24:59,944
Mom!

1079
01:25:34,652 --> 01:25:41,652
when your father asked me weather I want love
or respect, then I thought love was enough.

1080
01:25:42,944 --> 01:25:45,652
I thought his respect is mine too.

1081
01:25:47,444 --> 01:25:54,111
But I never thought you will face
so many insults because of this.

1082
01:25:56,111 --> 01:26:04,402
Had I known it, I would have taken
some poison when you were in my womb.

1083
01:26:07,111 --> 01:26:07,944
Mom!

1084
01:26:08,986 --> 01:26:10,777
Please forgive me, my son.

1085
01:26:10,986 --> 01:26:14,027
What is this maa? What are you talking?
What happened now?

1086
01:26:14,027 --> 01:26:17,694
You have injuries on your head
thatâ€™s why you are talking like this.. Sleep now.

1087
01:26:17,986 --> 01:26:19,819
Grandma... Please maker her sleep.

1088
01:26:20,027 --> 01:26:23,527
Donâ€™t cry my dear.
Drink some porridge.

1089
01:26:24,111 --> 01:26:25,194
Mom...

1090
01:26:33,402 --> 01:26:36,236
Get some tea. Do you have money?
-I have bro.

1091
01:26:37,944 --> 01:26:39,194
Bro...

1092
01:26:44,656 --> 01:26:49,198
I was just five-year-old then.

1093
01:26:51,489 --> 01:26:53,114
I didnâ€™t even know how to fight.

1094
01:26:55,906 --> 01:27:00,073
These guys have created all kinds of troubles
and took away whatever we had.

1095
01:27:14,864 --> 01:27:19,531
My father had given me a gold chain for my birthday.

1096
01:27:20,656 --> 01:27:24,573
In that chain there used to be photo of me and my father.

1097
01:27:25,406 --> 01:27:29,448
That was the only thing I had as a memory in those things.

1098
01:27:31,406 --> 01:27:34,156
They took away that as well.

1099
01:27:40,198 --> 01:27:42,239
They took away everything that belonged to me.

1100
01:27:45,823 --> 01:27:50,531
I wonâ€™t keep silent if they try to take away what I have to get..

1101
01:27:52,198 --> 01:27:55,323
Whether it is 10 paise or 10 rupees.

1102
01:27:56,323 --> 01:27:57,614
I wonâ€™t spare anyone.

1103
01:27:58,364 --> 01:28:02,156
I wonâ€™t spare anyone, even if its Srinivasa on
the hill or Mangalam Srinu down the hill.

1104
01:28:02,531 --> 01:28:05,073
I will collect everything with interest.

1105
01:28:07,656 --> 01:28:08,864
This is Pushpa

1106
01:28:09,364 --> 01:28:10,531
Pushparaj here.

1107
01:28:11,156 --> 01:28:13,239
I wonâ€™t compromise.

1108
01:28:15,948 --> 01:28:17,448
Beat him hereâ€¦not there

1109
01:28:17,448 --> 01:28:18,614
I have already beaten him there bro.

1110
01:28:18,614 --> 01:28:20,198
Beat him on his knee?

1111
01:28:20,198 --> 01:28:21,239
On his kneeâ€™s bro?

1112
01:28:22,364 --> 01:28:26,031
That handâ€¦ Mouth...
Beat him on the mouth.

1113
01:28:26,031 --> 01:28:27,198
Idiot shouldnâ€™t open his mouth again.

1114
01:28:27,198 --> 01:28:29,198
Broâ€¦ He is scared

1115
01:28:29,198 --> 01:28:30,448
Thatâ€™s why I asked you to beat.

1116
01:28:30,864 --> 01:28:36,698
How dare he comes directly to me
and ask me to increase the rate?

1117
01:28:43,656 --> 01:28:48,281
It seems, Twenty-five is not enough for him..
he wants fifty lakhs per ton.

1118
01:28:48,614 --> 01:28:50,698
Fiftyâ€¦ Do you want Fifty lakhs?

1119
01:28:50,698 --> 01:28:54,156
If I donâ€™t give, you want to deal
with Chennai Murugan directly?

1120
01:28:54,989 --> 01:28:59,323
Why canâ€™t you beat him yourself?
You are sitting happily and ordering him?

1121
01:28:59,698 --> 01:29:03,198
Bro... Stop now.
Drink this and take a breath.

1122
01:29:03,739 --> 01:29:05,531
Havenâ€™t you got tired beating him since morning?

1123
01:29:05,948 --> 01:29:08,073
Unnecessary fuss all the time

1124
01:29:08,364 --> 01:29:10,323
She talks like that only.
You carry onâ€¦

1125
01:29:10,904 --> 01:29:11,821
Hello MLA Sir.

1126
01:29:12,238 --> 01:29:14,071
Come Pushpa. Sit.

1127
01:29:14,363 --> 01:29:15,363
Yes. Tell me MLA Sir

1128
01:29:15,363 --> 01:29:18,113
Hey Srinu. Heard that you kidnapped Nagesh.

1129
01:29:18,321 --> 01:29:20,946
His brother came and is regretting
for the mistake that happened.

1130
01:29:21,738 --> 01:29:22,863
Leave him for this time.

1131
01:29:23,321 --> 01:29:24,529
I will speak to you

1132
01:29:24,654 --> 01:29:26,988
So sad... I just killed him MLA Sir.

1133
01:29:27,571 --> 01:29:28,363
Brotherâ€¦

1134
01:29:29,363 --> 01:29:31,321
You should have called me five minutes ago.

1135
01:29:32,196 --> 01:29:36,196
Iâ€™m just washing the knife after cutting his neck
and your call came..

1136
01:29:36,196 --> 01:29:38,821
I had called your PA also in the morning Sir.
He also didnâ€™t say anything.

1137
01:29:38,988 --> 01:29:42,363
Hello MP Sir, please tell me in advance
if there is something like this next time.

1138
01:29:42,571 --> 01:29:43,904
Itâ€™s a matter of a personâ€™s life. Isnâ€™t it?

1139
01:29:44,071 --> 01:29:46,238
I donâ€™t want any differences
between you and me unnecessarily.

1140
01:29:46,238 --> 01:29:47,904
That's it sir... I take leave.

1141
01:29:49,154 --> 01:29:51,238
How are you Pushpa?
-Iâ€™m fine, Sister.

1142
01:29:51,946 --> 01:29:53,279
Everyone speaks good about you in our house.

1143
01:29:53,279 --> 01:29:55,154
Hey Nagesh.

1144
01:29:55,488 --> 01:30:00,863
I have given a word to the big man on the other side.
I will go wrong if I leave you.

1145
01:30:02,821 --> 01:30:05,196
Hey, Cut him into pieces.

1146
01:30:05,196 --> 01:30:06,071
Okay.

1147
01:30:10,821 --> 01:30:13,946
You guys have spoilt the entire floor...

1148
01:30:13,946 --> 01:30:16,488
Hey Venkatesu... make it clean.

1149
01:30:17,113 --> 01:30:19,279
What Pushpa? What made you come to me?

1150
01:30:19,279 --> 01:30:20,404
How is Kondareddy?

1151
01:30:20,404 --> 01:30:21,154
He is fine Brother.

1152
01:30:21,571 --> 01:30:23,154
Brother, I have mixed the color.

1153
01:30:23,529 --> 01:30:24,738
What is this? Is this black?

1154
01:30:24,904 --> 01:30:25,946
Yes, black brother.

1155
01:30:26,779 --> 01:30:28,988
Last time also you had said it was black
but had turned brown.

1156
01:30:29,446 --> 01:30:31,238
It was so awkward in front of everyone

1157
01:30:32,029 --> 01:30:35,238
It just happened like that last time brother.
This time it will be black for sure.

1158
01:30:35,363 --> 01:30:38,821
I donâ€™t have confidence in you.
Put on him and show.

1159
01:30:40,196 --> 01:30:41,404
apply on him.

1160
01:30:42,988 --> 01:30:45,988
See Pushpa, how he died struggling.

1161
01:30:46,154 --> 01:30:48,696
Else, he wanted Fifty lakhs per ton.

1162
01:30:48,863 --> 01:30:53,071
All you have to do is to cross two check posts
and deliver stocks to me.

1163
01:30:53,238 --> 01:30:57,404
I must cross fifteen check posts
to transport the stock to Chennai.

1164
01:30:57,446 --> 01:30:58,571
Can you imagine how difficult it is?

1165
01:30:58,696 --> 01:31:00,488
I agree brother, It is a very difficult job indeed.

1166
01:31:00,946 --> 01:31:04,196
Even I faced difficulty near fifteenth check post.

1167
01:31:04,363 --> 01:31:07,863
That SI Manikandan you know right.
He asked me for one lakh rupees.

1168
01:31:07,988 --> 01:31:09,196
That fellow.

1169
01:31:09,738 --> 01:31:14,696
Somehow, we made sure the
stock reached Chennai safely brother.

1170
01:31:18,196 --> 01:31:20,404
Have delivered the stock to Chennai?

1171
01:31:22,404 --> 01:31:24,279
Who told you to do that?

1172
01:31:24,279 --> 01:31:26,904
No Brother.
The twenty-five lakhs you give is not enough.

1173
01:31:27,113 --> 01:31:29,363
If you give one crore per ton,
I will sell to you only.

1174
01:31:29,738 --> 01:31:31,363
Crore?
What is it bro?

1175
01:31:32,071 --> 01:31:33,238
If I say I noâ€¦

1176
01:31:35,154 --> 01:31:36,821
Whom did he say he will sell brother?

1177
01:31:37,071 --> 01:31:38,363
Chennai Murugan.

1178
01:31:38,488 --> 01:31:39,946
I will sell it to him only.

1179
01:31:39,946 --> 01:31:41,071
Why should I go to a new person?

1180
01:31:41,196 --> 01:31:42,404
Hey, do you understand what you are asking?

1181
01:31:42,779 --> 01:31:44,446
We just cut his neck for asking fifty lakhs only.

1182
01:31:44,571 --> 01:31:47,154
And here you are asking for one crore.
Donâ€™t you see what just happened.. ?

1183
01:31:47,404 --> 01:31:48,196
I understand man.

1184
01:31:48,363 --> 01:31:50,446
I came here to ask fifty lakhs only.

1185
01:31:50,821 --> 01:31:53,571
But after seeing him, I understood
how high the risk is..

1186
01:31:53,613 --> 01:31:56,029
thatâ€™s why I am asking for a crore...
Am I right brother?

1187
01:31:57,321 --> 01:31:59,863
Brother, Tell me weather you can one crore per ton.

1188
01:32:00,196 --> 01:32:02,404
Otherwise, I will sell to Chennai Murugesan only.

1189
01:32:08,571 --> 01:32:11,113
All of you think about it and call me.

1190
01:32:11,404 --> 01:32:13,488
Okay?
I take leave brother.

1191
01:32:14,904 --> 01:32:19,071
Oh! What is this bro?

1192
01:32:19,071 --> 01:32:23,821
This is black for sure.
Donâ€™t worry and get it applied.

1193
01:32:31,613 --> 01:32:34,529
Look there, music is playing on top of the pot.

1194
01:32:40,779 --> 01:32:42,488
Brother, why did you leave him like that?

1195
01:32:43,696 --> 01:32:46,946
You are coming and asking me,
half an hour after he left?

1196
01:32:47,321 --> 01:32:50,446
I was in shock that he was speaking like that
even after seeing what death looks like.

1197
01:32:52,029 --> 01:32:54,279
Do you think I was in a dream sequence
with your sister?

1198
01:32:55,363 --> 01:32:57,154
I was also in a shock.

1199
01:32:58,363 --> 01:33:00,404
We have left him unnecessarily bro.
We should have killed him.

1200
01:33:00,404 --> 01:33:01,654
What do you say Singireddy?

1201
01:33:01,654 --> 01:33:02,571
Yes, Brother

1202
01:33:26,988 --> 01:33:29,321
Brother, Can I make a call?

1203
01:33:39,279 --> 01:33:40,196
Brotherâ€¦Murugan.

1204
01:33:40,363 --> 01:33:41,154
Greetings Bro.

1205
01:33:41,863 --> 01:33:44,529
This is syndicate member Pushpa speaking.

1206
01:33:46,613 --> 01:33:49,821
This time we donâ€™t want to sell stock to Mangalam Srinu.

1207
01:33:51,738 --> 01:33:53,488
Thinking of selling it to you directly.

1208
01:33:54,488 --> 01:33:56,613
Okâ€¦ Ok Brother.

1209
01:33:56,821 --> 01:33:58,988
Stock has already reached Chennai Sir.

1210
01:34:00,779 --> 01:34:04,571
I will come to Chennai tomorrow and discuss rate with you.

1211
01:34:04,571 --> 01:34:07,654
Ok. Write down my pager number brother.

1212
01:34:07,679 --> 01:34:10,554
Eight Threeâ€¦Eight four...
Yeah four.

1213
01:35:05,154 --> 01:35:07,071
You fool!

1214
01:35:08,113 --> 01:35:10,446
I didn't left because you spared me

1215
01:35:11,613 --> 01:35:14,113
I left because I decided to leave.

1216
01:35:14,488 --> 01:35:15,404
What?

1217
01:35:16,196 --> 01:35:18,571
You thought Pushpa means flower...

1218
01:35:19,279 --> 01:35:20,529
It's Fire!

1219
01:35:21,738 --> 01:35:23,029
Fire!

1220
01:35:48,153 --> 01:35:50,195
Who are you?
What do you want?

1221
01:35:50,195 --> 01:35:51,653
We have come to meet Murugan.

1222
01:35:51,653 --> 01:35:52,237
Is it?

1223
01:35:52,237 --> 01:35:53,987
Heyâ€¦ who are they?

1224
01:35:54,237 --> 01:35:56,445
Pushpa, Syndicate member.

1225
01:35:56,737 --> 01:35:59,362
Came from Tirupati to discuss business.

1226
01:35:59,612 --> 01:36:02,528
Hey, say Pager No. 8384.

1227
01:36:02,528 --> 01:36:03,695
He will recognize us with that

1228
01:36:03,695 --> 01:36:04,987
Why are you shouting in my ear?

1229
01:36:04,987 --> 01:36:08,945
Hey, Murugan Sir is busy and
he said he canâ€™t meet anyone.

1230
01:36:09,070 --> 01:36:09,987
You heard it right!

1231
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:12,862
Murugan Sir wonâ€™t meet anyone. Leave now

1232
01:36:12,862 --> 01:36:16,528
Let him say that after seeing this piece.

1233
01:36:16,653 --> 01:36:17,403
What is this?

1234
01:36:17,694 --> 01:36:21,236
This is Broâ€™s visiting card.
He will understand if he looks at it

1235
01:36:29,861 --> 01:36:31,486
Its 07:45 PM

1236
01:36:31,486 --> 01:36:33,069
It's tea time for Murugan sir.

1237
01:36:33,069 --> 01:36:34,528
Quickly go and give a tea to Murugan sir.

1238
01:36:35,069 --> 01:36:37,986
Hey, Tea wonâ€™t go anywhere.

1239
01:36:38,569 --> 01:36:40,319
Murugan himself will come to tea

1240
01:36:48,486 --> 01:36:49,528
What is this man?

1241
01:36:50,611 --> 01:36:51,444
A grade stock.

1242
01:36:52,278 --> 01:36:54,944
I had seen it long back when I started the business.

1243
01:36:56,028 --> 01:36:57,444
Iâ€™m seeing it again now.

1244
01:36:58,236 --> 01:36:59,361
This is gold.

1245
01:37:01,236 --> 01:37:03,778
How many hills we have to climb up
to see lord Venkateswara...

1246
01:37:03,778 --> 01:37:06,486
Likewise that many hills you need
to climb down to find this kind of stuff

1247
01:37:06,903 --> 01:37:08,861
This is A grade Stuff.

1248
01:37:09,069 --> 01:37:14,361
The smuggler who buys never knows its value
The one who the cuts the tree knows the exact value.

1249
01:37:37,944 --> 01:37:38,694
Open the door.

1250
01:37:53,194 --> 01:37:56,028
Two tonsâ€¦five trucks
We have ten tons of stock

1251
01:37:56,236 --> 01:37:57,278
Super man!

1252
01:37:58,861 --> 01:38:02,403
Will speak to Mangalam Srinu
and fix the rate. You leave.

1253
01:38:02,486 --> 01:38:05,944
Brother, We have decided not to sell
the stock to Mangalam Srinu.

1254
01:38:06,653 --> 01:38:08,861
That is why we came directly to sell it to you.

1255
01:38:08,986 --> 01:38:10,861
Thatâ€™s why we brought it this far.

1256
01:38:11,069 --> 01:38:12,361
Do you want stock or not?

1257
01:38:19,778 --> 01:38:21,486
Hey, close the door.

1258
01:38:21,611 --> 01:38:23,069
Start the vehicles...
-Bro.. bro...

1259
01:38:23,444 --> 01:38:26,944
Mangalam Srinu is very dangerous.

1260
01:38:27,694 --> 01:38:30,694
Can you do business defying him?

1261
01:38:33,736 --> 01:38:36,486
Can you buy the stock defying him?

1262
01:38:36,486 --> 01:38:39,319
Any who came here defying Mangalam Srinu
and they are all dead.

1263
01:38:40,319 --> 01:38:42,611
Brother, many would have come to you.

1264
01:38:43,069 --> 01:38:47,069
I called from Srinannaâ€™s place only and
told you that I am coming to you

1265
01:38:47,694 --> 01:38:48,736
Iâ€™m different bro.

1266
01:38:48,861 --> 01:38:50,736
Who are you? Are you a crack?

1267
01:38:51,694 --> 01:38:54,569
Do you know to whom you are talking to?

1268
01:38:54,778 --> 01:38:56,278
I am Kondareddyâ€™s partner.

1269
01:38:56,944 --> 01:38:59,486
Konda Reddy himself sent me here to talk to you.

1270
01:38:59,486 --> 01:39:02,694
Are you Kondareddyâ€™s man?

1271
01:39:03,361 --> 01:39:05,028
You should have told me that earlier.

1272
01:39:05,069 --> 01:39:06,069
Call him.

1273
01:39:07,903 --> 01:39:10,153
Let me speak once.

1274
01:39:10,194 --> 01:39:14,153
That, only after negotiating the price..

1275
01:39:14,736 --> 01:39:15,986
Tell me what is the rate?

1276
01:39:17,778 --> 01:39:18,486
Hello!

1277
01:39:18,653 --> 01:39:19,736
Brother Kondareeddy

1278
01:39:20,028 --> 01:39:22,194
Hey Pushpa. Didnâ€™t see you for the last 2 days.

1279
01:39:22,403 --> 01:39:23,236
Where did you go?

1280
01:39:23,444 --> 01:39:24,611
I came to Chennai?

1281
01:39:24,903 --> 01:39:27,069
Chennai? Why??

1282
01:39:27,569 --> 01:39:29,403
I came here to meet Murugan.

1283
01:39:29,611 --> 01:39:30,736
To meet Murugan?

1284
01:39:31,153 --> 01:39:33,236
Hey Jakka.
He says he went to meet Murugan

1285
01:39:35,486 --> 01:39:36,694
Whose permission did you take to go to Murugan?

1286
01:39:36,819 --> 01:39:38,444
I asked you to go and meet Mangalam Srinu, right?

1287
01:39:38,611 --> 01:39:41,403
What bro? Doesnâ€™t Kondareddy know
that we came here?

1288
01:39:44,444 --> 01:39:48,611
Just because we gave 4% share,
you want to act as you wish?

1289
01:39:50,194 --> 01:39:51,153
One and half croreâ€¦

1290
01:39:58,028 --> 01:40:00,694
One and half crore per ton.

1291
01:40:00,819 --> 01:40:02,736
I just negotiated the deal with Murugan.

1292
01:40:03,236 --> 01:40:06,361
As usual, do you want me to sell to
Mangalam Srinu for twenty-five lakhs

1293
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:08,736
or take risk and sell it to Murugan for one and half croreâ€¦

1294
01:40:13,819 --> 01:40:15,319
Understood bro.

1295
01:40:16,194 --> 01:40:23,319
I will tell Muragan brother that
you canâ€™t do business defying Mangalam Srinu.

1296
01:40:23,361 --> 01:40:24,903
I will tell him that we donâ€™t have the guts.

1297
01:40:25,611 --> 01:40:28,153
I held back for all these days not because
I donâ€™t have guts.

1298
01:40:28,444 --> 01:40:30,861
I stopped because I was bound by Syndicateâ€™s decision.

1299
01:40:30,986 --> 01:40:35,403
When we know that Mangalam Srinu is
cheating us, who cares for the syndicate?

1300
01:40:35,611 --> 01:40:36,986
Finalize the deal.

1301
01:40:41,486 --> 01:40:42,153
Brother...

1302
01:40:42,569 --> 01:40:48,736
50% share to me and 50% to you from the profits.
You remember we agreed on this the other day.

1303
01:40:58,069 --> 01:41:00,236
How dare you information to police
about us.. you idiot?

1304
01:41:07,236 --> 01:41:10,361
What is the point of talking to him brother,
when he was informing everything about us to Police.

1305
01:41:16,403 --> 01:41:17,944
I donâ€™t have anything to do with it.. brother.

1306
01:41:18,361 --> 01:41:19,778
He did everything.

1307
01:41:20,403 --> 01:41:22,194
You knew, that he was doing all this.

1308
01:41:26,444 --> 01:41:27,486
I know, brother.

1309
01:41:27,486 --> 01:41:28,569
Why didnâ€™t you not inform us?

1310
01:41:31,069 --> 01:41:34,361
He lured me with money.

1311
01:41:35,611 --> 01:41:38,361
I got greedy in the hope to perform my daughterâ€™s marriage.

1312
01:41:39,278 --> 01:41:40,236
Daughter?

1313
01:41:40,736 --> 01:41:41,819
Who is that?

1314
01:41:42,278 --> 01:41:43,903
Does he have a grown up daughter.. ?

1315
01:41:44,361 --> 01:41:47,611
same one brother, the one you saw
when she came to theatre.. that one..

1316
01:41:47,986 --> 01:41:50,194
Is she, his daughter?

1317
01:41:51,486 --> 01:41:53,944
Isnâ€™t she beautiful? I saw her from far.

1318
01:41:53,944 --> 01:41:56,611
She looks just ok bro

1319
01:41:58,278 --> 01:42:00,903
Then ask her to come once.
We shall talk to her

1320
01:42:04,819 --> 01:42:05,819
Lay him down here.

1321
01:42:07,236 --> 01:42:09,486
Rey, You guys go and get his parents

1322
01:42:10,236 --> 01:42:10,736
My...

1323
01:42:11,069 --> 01:42:11,903
Where is my father?

1324
01:42:12,403 --> 01:42:13,694
What happened to him.

1325
01:42:15,028 --> 01:42:15,611
Iâ€™m asking you.

1326
01:42:15,736 --> 01:42:16,903
What happened to my father?

1327
01:42:17,111 --> 01:42:17,903
Tell me.

1328
01:42:18,403 --> 01:42:19,236
What happened to my father?

1329
01:42:21,569 --> 01:42:25,069
Rey Busappa, you said she is just ok.

1330
01:42:26,069 --> 01:42:28,819
But she is looking superb like a film heroine.

1331
01:42:29,819 --> 01:42:31,444
Your father is alive.

1332
01:42:31,486 --> 01:42:36,736
But go home and have a bath with lux soap.

1333
01:42:37,194 --> 01:42:42,444
wear this saree with jasmine flowers
and come here in the night.

1334
01:42:42,736 --> 01:42:44,403
Then, You can take your father home in the morning.

1335
01:42:45,111 --> 01:42:47,486
Get ready like a bride for Jalanna and come.

1336
01:42:48,361 --> 01:42:52,236
What? Canâ€™t you adjust for one night
for the sake of your fatherâ€™s life?

1337
01:42:56,236 --> 01:42:58,444
Goâ€¦Go.

1338
01:44:16,611 --> 01:44:17,236
Hey!

1339
01:44:17,444 --> 01:44:17,944
Bro!

1340
01:44:18,361 --> 01:44:21,861
Go out and have some beer and biryani.
Come back in the morning.

1341
01:44:21,903 --> 01:44:22,611
Ok bro.

1342
01:44:22,736 --> 01:44:25,611
Rey, we can do this in the morning.
Letâ€™s go. Rey. Letâ€™s go

1343
01:44:51,028 --> 01:44:52,528
How come you came here dear?

1344
01:44:53,986 --> 01:44:55,403
Have you lost your way?

1345
01:44:55,403 --> 01:44:57,861
Jalreddy is saying that he will kill my father

1346
01:44:58,736 --> 01:45:01,736
Why Jalreddy?
Even I would kill him.

1347
01:45:02,819 --> 01:45:04,903
How could your father
show loyalty to the Police?

1348
01:45:05,153 --> 01:45:08,944
He said he will spare him,
if I sleep with him tonight.

1349
01:45:14,986 --> 01:45:16,444
You came all decked up right.

1350
01:45:16,986 --> 01:45:19,819
Go there.
Why did you come here?

1351
01:45:22,444 --> 01:45:26,903
If I go there tonight, my father might
return home in the morning...

1352
01:45:27,736 --> 01:45:29,194
but I will not be able to come to your house ever.

1353
01:45:29,611 --> 01:45:32,069
Why do you want to come to the house of
a guy who doesnâ€™t have surname?

1354
01:45:32,653 --> 01:45:34,569
You must have felt happy on the day the relation broke.

1355
01:45:34,569 --> 01:45:37,194
You must have felt very happy
that you have gotten rid of me,

1356
01:45:37,194 --> 01:45:38,653
and you donâ€™t need to see my face ever again.

1357
01:45:39,736 --> 01:45:41,194
Is this what you understood?

1358
01:45:42,403 --> 01:45:44,111
You are like this, from the beginning.

1359
01:45:44,444 --> 01:45:47,653
When did you ever understood the heart
of a girl that you can understand today.

1360
01:45:49,736 --> 01:45:53,778
When my friends told me that you are feeling sad,
because I was not looking at you,

1361
01:45:54,403 --> 01:45:58,569
I felt very happy that this boy likes me so much.

1362
01:45:59,736 --> 01:46:03,361
I liked you as soon as I saw you.

1363
01:46:05,903 --> 01:46:07,778
When you gave me money and asked for a kiss...

1364
01:46:07,986 --> 01:46:12,736
I thought this is your way of expressing love.

1365
01:46:15,278 --> 01:46:18,694
When I said that I want to give first kiss to my husband,

1366
01:46:19,569 --> 01:46:23,694
I gave an indication to you to marry me.

1367
01:46:24,653 --> 01:46:26,319
You didn't understand even that.

1368
01:46:27,569 --> 01:46:29,944
My father doesnâ€™t even start the lorry without my nod.

1369
01:46:30,319 --> 01:46:34,028
Do you think you could come to my house
for marriage proposal without my wish?

1370
01:46:35,528 --> 01:46:42,111
Do you know how bad I felt seeing
you anxious when mother-in-law got hurt?

1371
01:46:42,319 --> 01:46:44,986
You could have understood that,
had you seen into my eyes once.

1372
01:46:46,361 --> 01:46:47,778
You left even without looking at me.

1373
01:46:47,903 --> 01:46:51,194
Do you mean to say, that I should
change my heart after hearing whatever you said...

1374
01:46:51,194 --> 01:46:53,653
and go fight with jaali and save your father?

1375
01:46:54,486 --> 01:46:55,986
It is not going to happen.
Leave now

1376
01:46:55,986 --> 01:46:58,611
I know that you wonâ€™t do anything like that.

1377
01:46:59,569 --> 01:47:01,486
Your money and business are important to you, Isnâ€™t it?

1378
01:47:01,861 --> 01:47:05,403
Why will you fight for a stranger like me?

1379
01:47:07,444 --> 01:47:10,278
Anyways, I didnâ€™t come for that.

1380
01:47:10,319 --> 01:47:11,319
Then why did you come?

1381
01:47:20,028 --> 01:47:28,569
I always wanted to share my first kiss and my first night
with someone whom I consider my husband.

1382
01:47:33,736 --> 01:47:35,903
Please sleep with me once.

1383
01:47:36,694 --> 01:47:39,278
You will never see me again.

1384
01:47:41,361 --> 01:47:42,528
I will go.

1385
01:47:44,319 --> 01:47:46,444
And after that I donâ€™t care what happens to my life.

1386
01:47:51,986 --> 01:47:52,944
What is this dear?

1387
01:47:54,569 --> 01:47:56,486
Do you love me so much?

1388
01:47:59,028 --> 01:48:02,611
You think I will allow anyone to lay his hand
on you after what you said.

1389
01:48:04,903 --> 01:48:06,486
Whoever it is..

1390
01:48:10,361 --> 01:48:12,944
will not allow

1391
01:48:21,611 --> 01:48:22,819
What Pushpa?

1392
01:48:24,028 --> 01:48:26,736
You only brought the girl to make her sleep with me.

1393
01:48:27,611 --> 01:48:29,944
Are you doing all this for just 4 percent?

1394
01:49:31,319 --> 01:49:33,861
Hey, I am going to kill you today.

1395
01:50:15,528 --> 01:50:19,319
Are you firing?

1396
01:50:20,486 --> 01:50:21,361
Dear, Come here.

1397
01:50:21,819 --> 01:50:23,069
Are you firing bullets on to the girl?

1398
01:50:23,361 --> 01:50:26,986
I am going to kill you, idiot.

1399
01:50:45,069 --> 01:50:47,861
How dare you lay a hand on girls?

1400
01:50:54,944 --> 01:50:56,194
Muniratnam, get up!

1401
01:51:09,153 --> 01:51:12,903
Look Srivalli, your father is fine.
I made him sit in the car.

1402
01:51:13,528 --> 01:51:17,986
What is this man?
You have hit Jalreddy so badly.

1403
01:51:18,278 --> 01:51:21,361
O Jalanna. I feel pity looking at you.

1404
01:51:22,111 --> 01:51:25,694
What maccha?
You made him incapable for anything.

1405
01:51:25,694 --> 01:51:28,403
If Kondareddy gets to know if this, he will kill you bro.

1406
01:51:28,778 --> 01:51:31,819
Hey, who will tell?
This fellow only should say if at allâ€¦

1407
01:51:31,944 --> 01:51:35,444
What man? What will you tell your brother?

1408
01:51:35,444 --> 01:51:40,528
Will you go cry before him and
tell him shamelessly that Pushpa beat you.

1409
01:51:40,611 --> 01:51:44,944
Ey Jaali, Go and complain.
I donâ€™t care.

1410
01:51:45,028 --> 01:51:46,778
Dear, come letâ€™s go.

1411
01:51:46,861 --> 01:51:49,403
We will get it resolved either this way or that way.
Iâ€™m ready for whatever happens.

1412
01:51:49,403 --> 01:51:54,694
Pushpa, Iâ€™m not an idiot to go
and complain to my brothers.

1413
01:51:56,653 --> 01:51:59,069
This is between you and meâ€¦

1414
01:52:00,819 --> 01:52:03,944
and I will deal about this with you directly.

1415
01:52:05,153 --> 01:52:06,653
I wonâ€™t leave you.

1416
01:52:06,653 --> 01:52:10,528
This.. This ..This ..
This is what is called as being a man.

1417
01:52:10,528 --> 01:52:15,736
What you did with women
all these days is not like a man.

1418
01:52:16,278 --> 01:52:18,861
Now you have proven that you are a man.

1419
01:52:19,028 --> 01:52:20,653
Now stand on your word.

1420
01:52:20,903 --> 01:52:23,986
Kesava, he has masculinity in him.

1421
01:52:24,361 --> 01:52:26,153
I think he will stand on his word.

1422
01:52:26,653 --> 01:52:29,069
What dear? What do you think?

1423
01:52:29,069 --> 01:52:30,694
I too believe the same

1424
01:52:30,903 --> 01:52:32,278
He will stand on his word right

1425
01:52:32,278 --> 01:52:34,403
How will he stand,
when you have already broken everything.

1426
01:52:43,528 --> 01:52:45,861
Muniratnam, Come... come.

1427
01:52:50,986 --> 01:52:52,819
Pushpa, I will park the car at home and come.

1428
01:52:58,861 --> 01:52:59,653
Mom!

1429
01:53:05,944 --> 01:53:07,361
Srivalli, I will take leave.

1430
01:53:07,361 --> 01:53:08,194
Pushpa!

1431
01:53:08,694 --> 01:53:10,528
Come and have dinner.

1432
01:53:10,944 --> 01:53:11,986
No need Aunty.

1433
01:53:12,694 --> 01:53:16,278
My mom is waiting for me... I have to go.

1434
01:53:16,319 --> 01:53:17,736
Pushpa, wait a minute.

1435
01:53:18,069 --> 01:53:18,944
You come.

1436
01:53:29,736 --> 01:53:30,944
My mom asked me to give this to you.

1437
01:53:33,403 --> 01:53:34,278
Okay.

1438
01:53:35,986 --> 01:53:36,736
You go.

1439
01:53:41,236 --> 01:53:42,694
Why are you staring at me?

1440
01:53:42,986 --> 01:53:43,528
Go.

1441
01:53:46,694 --> 01:53:47,611
What?

1442
01:53:57,319 --> 01:54:00,861
When you call me Dearâ€¦ Dear,
I feel like I have become your wife

1443
01:54:00,861 --> 01:54:03,778
Darlingâ€¦ My Darling

1444
01:54:04,278 --> 01:54:07,819
When I call you Darlingâ€¦ Darling,
you suit well as my Husband

1445
01:54:07,819 --> 01:54:10,736
Darlingâ€¦ My Darling

1446
01:54:11,028 --> 01:54:13,694
When I walk behind you

1447
01:54:14,444 --> 01:54:16,361
When I walk behind you

1448
01:54:16,403 --> 01:54:19,111
It feels like going uphill
to Venkanna Temple, Darling

1449
01:54:19,569 --> 01:54:21,569
When I sit next to you

1450
01:54:21,611 --> 01:54:24,528
It feels like I got Lord Parameshwara.

1451
01:54:24,778 --> 01:54:28,319
When I look at the path as you leave
It is as if the lake has dried up.

1452
01:54:28,319 --> 01:54:31,236
Darlingâ€¦ My Darling

1453
01:54:31,528 --> 01:54:34,361
My Darlingâ€¦. Come here Darling

1454
01:54:34,778 --> 01:54:38,111
Darling with Golden Heartâ€¦
Darling with Pride. Darling with Emotions

1455
01:54:38,236 --> 01:54:41,028
My Darlingâ€¦ Come here Darling

1456
01:54:41,611 --> 01:54:44,944
Darling with Golden Heartâ€¦
Darling with Pride. Darling with Emotions

1457
01:54:59,569 --> 01:55:05,611
When you tie lungi above the thighs...

1458
01:55:06,486 --> 01:55:09,778
When you tie lungi above the thighs...

1459
01:55:09,778 --> 01:55:12,153
My breath gets stopped Darling

1460
01:55:13,069 --> 01:55:16,611
When you are chewing a Jarda Pan

1461
01:55:16,611 --> 01:55:19,528
My body gets painted Redâ€¦ Darling

1462
01:55:19,569 --> 01:55:22,319
When I hear your yells and roarsâ€¦

1463
01:55:29,903 --> 01:55:33,278
When I hear your yells and roarsâ€¦
It thrills me like hellâ€¦

1464
01:55:33,403 --> 01:55:36,778
When you sit cross legged, it mesmerizes me.

1465
01:55:36,778 --> 01:55:40,444
When you take out two buttons and show your chest
Wonâ€™t it overflow like a milk Pot

1466
01:55:40,444 --> 01:55:43,569
My Darlingâ€¦ my Darling

1467
01:55:43,611 --> 01:55:46,403
My Darlingâ€¦ Come here Darling

1468
01:55:46,819 --> 01:55:50,153
Darling with Golden Heartâ€¦
Darling with Pride. Darling with Emotions

1469
01:55:50,236 --> 01:55:53,028
My Darlingâ€¦ Come here Darling

1470
01:55:53,444 --> 01:55:56,778
Darling with Golden Heartâ€¦
Darling with Pride. Darling with Emotions

1471
01:56:11,569 --> 01:56:16,736
When I wear a new saree and you donâ€™t complement

1472
01:56:18,236 --> 01:56:21,819
When I wear a new saree and you donâ€™t complement

1473
01:56:21,861 --> 01:56:24,361
Wouldnâ€™t that saree value become zero, Darling...

1474
01:56:25,111 --> 01:56:28,778
When I wear flowers in my hair
And if you donâ€™t smell them

1475
01:56:28,778 --> 01:56:31,361
Wouldnâ€™t the flower mound fall down.

1476
01:56:31,736 --> 01:56:34,944
When my saree frill slips down

1477
01:56:41,861 --> 01:56:45,319
When my saree frill slips down,
and you wonâ€™t look at me

1478
01:56:45,319 --> 01:56:48,778
The naughty wind would sympathize with me, Darling

1479
01:56:48,819 --> 01:56:52,611
If my beauty doesnâ€™t become yours,
my life as girl would become poor

1480
01:56:52,611 --> 01:56:55,569
Darlingâ€¦my Darling

1481
01:56:55,569 --> 01:56:58,361
My Darlingâ€¦ Come here Darling

1482
01:56:58,778 --> 01:57:02,111
Darling with Golden Heartâ€¦
Darling with Pride. Darling with Emotions

1483
01:57:02,194 --> 01:57:04,986
My Darlingâ€¦ Come here Darling

1484
01:57:05,403 --> 01:57:08,736
Darling with Golden Heartâ€¦
Darling with Pride. Darling with Emotions

1485
01:57:18,236 --> 01:57:21,611
Bro, Operation to the spine it seems.

1486
01:57:21,944 --> 01:57:25,028
Doctor is saying only after that
he can say if he can walk or not

1487
01:57:29,194 --> 01:57:31,028
He wonâ€™t say who hit him.

1488
01:57:31,028 --> 01:57:32,236
And you people donâ€™t know.

1489
01:57:32,819 --> 01:57:33,736
Is that right?

1490
01:57:33,944 --> 01:57:34,778
Yes Brother.

1491
01:57:40,986 --> 01:57:42,486
Broâ€¦ Broâ€¦ Bro

1492
01:57:42,486 --> 01:57:44,236
Whom did he sleep with last night?

1493
01:57:44,236 --> 01:57:46,778
Muniratnam daughter cameâ€¦ Bro

1494
01:57:46,778 --> 01:57:51,278
Muniratnam daughter came in the night and
went back in the morning with her father.

1495
01:57:51,278 --> 01:57:53,278
Then, who hit him?

1496
01:58:02,486 --> 01:58:05,903
Bro, looks like Kondareddy wants to kill the guy
who thrashed Jalreddy,

1497
01:58:05,903 --> 01:58:08,903
once he gets to know who did it.. ignoring that,
you are looking at Pager and money.

1498
01:58:09,319 --> 01:58:12,944
Only six months? For the trashing I gave him,
He should not get up for one year.

1499
01:58:13,194 --> 01:58:15,694
I think I havenâ€™t given him enough.. .

1500
01:58:16,153 --> 01:58:19,819
Bro, Jalreddy still has some masculinity left in him.
That is why he didnâ€™t name you.

1501
01:58:19,944 --> 01:58:21,694
What If Kondareddy gets to know thisâ€¦

1502
01:58:21,778 --> 01:58:24,028
I lost my count..
How will Kondareddy get to know?

1503
01:58:26,153 --> 01:58:29,778
What Pushpa?
Has the stock reached Murugan?

1504
01:58:30,278 --> 01:58:32,403
Reached Bro. He sent the message too.
Just reached it seems

1505
01:58:32,903 --> 01:58:36,986
Ok. You should go to Tirupati tomorrow
and get the money.

1506
01:58:37,069 --> 01:58:40,028
That Hawala slip is with you, only right?
- It is safe with me.

1507
01:58:40,028 --> 01:58:41,153
Be ready in the morning

1508
01:58:42,694 --> 01:58:43,986
what is that injury on your hand?

1509
01:58:44,194 --> 01:58:46,444
Thisâ€¦ Our
- Thatâ€¦ Got scratched when coming in car.

1510
01:58:47,319 --> 01:58:48,778
Be careful man. Okâ€¦

1511
01:58:49,194 --> 01:58:50,319
What Subbareddy?
- Broâ€¦

1512
01:58:50,319 --> 01:58:52,653
Did you get the jeep tyres changed?
- got it Changed bro

1513
01:58:57,236 --> 01:59:00,986
Bro. Do you think he heard?
- No, He didnâ€™t.

1514
01:59:01,236 --> 01:59:03,944
No Bro. I have a doubt that he must have heard..

1515
01:59:04,403 --> 01:59:07,986
I will do one thing.
I will go out and close the door and wait there..

1516
01:59:07,986 --> 01:59:10,361
You speak something.
I will see if can hear it or not

1517
01:59:12,569 --> 01:59:14,236
Bro... Speak.. Speak

1518
01:59:22,736 --> 01:59:24,069
bro, I could not hear anything

1519
01:59:24,861 --> 01:59:26,236
I didnâ€™t speak anything

1520
01:59:30,069 --> 01:59:32,819
What manâ€¦ What is this?
- Mosquitos Bro

1521
01:59:32,861 --> 01:59:34,028
What?
- Mosquitos

1522
01:59:34,986 --> 01:59:37,361
Be careful man. Too many mosquitos here.
What if we get Dengue Fever?

1523
01:59:37,361 --> 01:59:41,903
Iâ€™m going to Tirupati on workâ€¦
Do you want anything?

1524
01:59:42,361 --> 01:59:44,361
Donâ€™t you know what I want?

1525
01:59:45,028 --> 01:59:46,819
Your hands look good.

1526
01:59:47,694 --> 01:59:49,486
Should I bring you gold ring?

1527
01:59:53,153 --> 01:59:55,611
What? Donâ€™t you like gold ring?

1528
01:59:56,819 --> 01:59:57,986
What do you want?

1529
01:59:59,486 --> 02:00:02,861
You are staring at me with eyes wide open.
What happened?

1530
02:00:03,236 --> 02:00:04,653
What are you doing?

1531
02:00:05,569 --> 02:00:07,278
- Going to Tirupati on work

1532
02:00:07,736 --> 02:00:09,403
What are you doing now?

1533
02:00:09,861 --> 02:00:11,236
Looking at you

1534
02:00:11,944 --> 02:00:13,153
Where is your hand?

1535
02:00:13,319 --> 02:00:15,486
what?
- Where is your hand?

1536
02:00:16,403 --> 02:00:19,111
Oh. Did my hand touch you? Sorry dear

1537
02:00:20,736 --> 02:00:23,278
Didnâ€™t touch.
It is still there.

1538
02:00:23,944 --> 02:00:25,861
I was talking on the phone.. here, I removed it..

1539
02:00:26,153 --> 02:00:29,236
I didnâ€™t realise it because I was busy talking on phone

1540
02:00:29,361 --> 02:00:31,319
You didnâ€™t know, is it?
You didnâ€™t know?

1541
02:00:31,444 --> 02:00:33,819
You didnâ€™t know, is it?
- Hey... Why are you hitting me, dear?

1542
02:00:33,819 --> 02:00:37,569
Donâ€™t to talk after doing
whatever you wanted to do.

1543
02:00:37,569 --> 02:00:39,278
Iâ€™m leaving now.

1544
02:00:39,736 --> 02:00:43,069
I came here to see your face before
going for money collection.

1545
02:00:43,069 --> 02:00:44,819
Do you know how excitedly I came?What?

1546
02:00:45,361 --> 02:00:48,444
Did I come to get hit by you? I will go.

1547
02:00:48,611 --> 02:00:52,069
Sorry Darling...
-I'll go...

1548
02:00:52,069 --> 02:00:53,111
- This is all waste business.

1549
02:00:53,111 --> 02:00:54,778
Sorry Darling
-I will leave

1550
02:00:54,861 --> 02:00:57,694
What Darling?
You only did it and now you are only getting angry.

1551
02:00:58,611 --> 02:01:02,278
Why did you hit me? Seâ€¦ Again,
you are getting angry

1552
02:01:02,278 --> 02:01:03,944
Hold it darling

1553
02:01:05,069 --> 02:01:07,778
No, you will again abuse me
- Hold it, Darling

1554
02:01:08,028 --> 02:01:10,611
No, Thanks
- Hold it, Darling

1555
02:01:13,361 --> 02:01:14,069
Thanks.

1556
02:01:17,236 --> 02:01:19,569
I will stay, you go dearâ€¦ go dearâ€¦

1557
02:01:24,736 --> 02:01:27,236
You have become smarter
-Srivalliâ€¦ Srivalli

1558
02:01:28,569 --> 02:01:29,944
Ok Darlingâ€¦ I leave now

1559
02:01:30,194 --> 02:01:34,444
Hey. What are you doing dear?
They will find it.

1560
02:01:35,569 --> 02:01:39,069
See, if your friend asks, tell her that we were just talking.
Donâ€™t tell her all these things.

1561
02:01:39,778 --> 02:01:40,736
It will spoil my reputation.

1562
02:01:40,736 --> 02:01:42,278
Ok, Darling. I know

1563
02:01:44,611 --> 02:01:46,361
It's time for real action.

1564
02:01:49,028 --> 02:01:51,194
what dear? Looks like a lot happened inside

1565
02:01:51,319 --> 02:01:52,069
Nothing.

1566
02:01:52,069 --> 02:01:54,653
Hey Srivalli.
Ask Pushpa to have tiffin and go.

1567
02:01:54,653 --> 02:01:57,153
He had tiffin aunty. He had it just now.

1568
02:01:57,403 --> 02:01:58,986
Canâ€™t you see it?

1569
02:01:58,986 --> 02:01:59,861
Srivalli!

1570
02:02:00,194 --> 02:02:01,444
Careful darling

1571
02:02:02,236 --> 02:02:04,861
Darling!

1572
02:02:14,819 --> 02:02:16,736
Shetji, are you fine?

1573
02:02:17,611 --> 02:02:20,569
How are you?
-Fine sir.

1574
02:02:20,944 --> 02:02:21,944
How are you?

1575
02:02:22,444 --> 02:02:23,986
I am fine.

1576
02:03:00,486 --> 02:03:03,111
You go... I'll come.

1577
02:03:03,194 --> 02:03:04,653
Pushpa... look, new models have arrived.

1578
02:03:25,986 --> 02:03:28,194
Pushpa, go to new godown.

1579
02:03:38,111 --> 02:03:44,611
If you wear a striking dress and
if we give frightening looksâ€¦ it scares (Song Humming)

1580
02:03:44,653 --> 02:03:52,736
aaâ€¦ you get scared. If we come walking with grace
and you stop us for funâ€¦ scareâ€¦ scares..scares

1581
02:03:52,986 --> 02:03:57,403
How did you hear what I was singing to myself?

1582
02:03:57,403 --> 02:04:00,694
Why canâ€™t I hear?
You think we canâ€™t hear whatever you guys speak inside?

1583
02:04:00,986 --> 02:04:07,944
Leave that. When you and Pushpa were talking of beating
Jalreddy, me and Kondareddy sir heard from outside.

1584
02:04:08,111 --> 02:04:10,236
What did you say? Move aside.

1585
02:04:20,486 --> 02:04:21,903
Max Pager Services

1586
02:04:21,903 --> 02:04:24,153
Sister, have to send a message urgently.

1587
02:04:24,153 --> 02:04:25,361
-Please tell me the number?

1588
02:05:14,153 --> 02:05:15,153
Get him up.

1589
02:05:17,653 --> 02:05:21,069
What man? Did you forget who we are?

1590
02:05:22,361 --> 02:05:25,528
Just because we gave you four percent share
and a seat next to us,

1591
02:05:25,528 --> 02:05:28,528
do you think we will remain silent
if you lay your hands on our brother?

1592
02:05:28,694 --> 02:05:31,278
I will kill you, idiot.

1593
02:05:31,861 --> 02:05:34,944
Hey. He has a 5 crore hawala slip in his pocket.
Search for it.

1594
02:05:36,153 --> 02:05:38,444
Why are you laughing?
- Hit the idiot. Hit him

1595
02:05:38,903 --> 02:05:40,903
My brother is talking and you are laughing at him.

1596
02:05:40,903 --> 02:05:42,486
Else what bro?

1597
02:05:42,486 --> 02:05:47,569
Are you killing me truly because of your
love for your brother...

1598
02:05:47,569 --> 02:05:52,194
or do you think if you kill me,
you can have all the money?

1599
02:05:53,444 --> 02:05:55,694
Heyâ€¦ Nothing is bigger than my brother.

1600
02:05:55,861 --> 02:05:59,236
Itâ€™s a nice joke bro.
Maybe this is the last joke I will hear.

1601
02:05:59,528 --> 02:06:02,986
What are you searching man?
I keep it in the fold of my hand sleeve right.

1602
02:06:03,028 --> 02:06:07,153
Anyways, you are not like before, Kondareddy bro.
You have become very commercial.

1603
02:06:07,153 --> 02:06:09,111
Hey Subbareddy. Is it the same slip?

1604
02:06:09,153 --> 02:06:09,903
Yes Brother. It is the same slip.

1605
02:06:09,944 --> 02:06:10,903
On which date do we get our money?

1606
02:06:10,944 --> 02:06:13,861
New title for you. Commercial Kondareddy.
Tag line- No Masculinity

1607
02:06:15,069 --> 02:06:16,319
Hey, take him and throw him in the pit

1608
02:06:16,361 --> 02:06:21,111
I know brother, that these kind of businesses
will definitely see death some day.

1609
02:06:21,444 --> 02:06:26,361
If by mistake, Lord Venkateswara supports me and saves me,

1610
02:06:27,069 --> 02:06:29,153
I will become a very big man for sure.

1611
02:06:29,361 --> 02:06:31,944
I will sit on the top.

1612
02:06:33,861 --> 02:06:36,319
Yes. I can visualize my future.

1613
02:06:39,944 --> 02:06:43,611
Why delay?
Shoot him up.

1614
02:10:09,403 --> 02:10:10,528
Cut the rope.

1615
02:10:11,236 --> 02:10:12,111
Cut the rope.

1616
02:10:22,111 --> 02:10:23,153
Quickly.

1617
02:10:27,319 --> 02:10:28,319
Come on cut the rope.

1618
02:10:42,111 --> 02:10:45,194
Pushpa, come fast.

1619
02:10:47,986 --> 02:10:51,111
Pushpa! I already said I had a doubt
that Konda Reddy has heard it.

1620
02:11:17,486 --> 02:11:18,361
Hold on guys..

1621
02:11:25,153 --> 02:11:27,361
He is getting scared.. he is scared..

1622
02:11:35,236 --> 02:11:38,611
Bro, we found jakkareddy.

1623
02:11:38,694 --> 02:11:41,319
what are you waiting for? Kill him

1624
02:11:41,403 --> 02:11:42,319
I will cut his neck broâ€¦

1625
02:11:42,444 --> 02:11:43,778
then what about that coolie?

1626
02:11:43,778 --> 02:11:46,903
You mean, that Pushpa?
Our men would have killed him by now broâ€¦

1627
02:12:56,778 --> 02:12:59,028
What Jakkareddy?
What are you looking at me like that.

1628
02:12:59,236 --> 02:13:01,153
Is it because I came back?

1629
02:13:01,319 --> 02:13:03,486
You and I may have million things between usâ€¦

1630
02:13:03,653 --> 02:13:07,278
but when an outsider comes, you are my partner.
Thatâ€™s it.

1631
02:13:55,319 --> 02:13:56,694
What manâ€¦ why are you coming on to me like that.

1632
02:13:57,528 --> 02:14:00,236
If my brother-in-law comes to know of it
he wonâ€™t leave you..

1633
02:14:00,403 --> 02:14:01,736
If you something harm to me,
my brother-in-law wonâ€™t leave you.

1634
02:14:12,153 --> 02:14:14,111
Why are you taking out the gun? Will you kill me?

1635
02:14:14,236 --> 02:14:17,111
My brother-in-law wonâ€™t keep quite if you do anything to me.
He will kill all of you.

1636
02:14:17,361 --> 02:14:20,903
True Pushpa, It will become a big mess if you touch him.

1637
02:14:21,194 --> 02:14:23,278
He is getting scared. He is getting scared.

1638
02:14:23,569 --> 02:14:25,194
Even I want to kill him Pushpa.

1639
02:14:28,278 --> 02:14:30,694
But noâ€¦ Leave him.

1640
02:14:32,194 --> 02:14:33,528
Let this end with my brother

1641
02:14:34,111 --> 02:14:36,236
He is getting scaredâ€¦ Scared.

1642
02:14:36,569 --> 02:14:38,611
Thatâ€™s all. Everyone should fear my brother-in-law.

1643
02:14:39,194 --> 02:14:41,111
Seeâ€¦ here my brother-in-law himself is calling.

1644
02:14:42,986 --> 02:14:44,611
I will go. I will go away.

1645
02:14:44,819 --> 02:14:46,569
Hey Kesavaâ€¦Start the vehicle.

1646
02:14:48,444 --> 02:14:49,528
Talk to him...

1647
02:14:51,569 --> 02:14:53,319
What man Mogileesu?

1648
02:14:53,528 --> 02:14:54,694
Yeah, Srinu broâ€¦

1649
02:14:55,569 --> 02:14:56,319
Tell...

1650
02:14:59,278 --> 02:15:01,986
Bro, they caught Mogileesu.

1651
02:15:04,903 --> 02:15:07,736
Look Pushpa. Listen to what I am saying..

1652
02:15:07,903 --> 02:15:12,278
Let us do business together..
that too at the rate you asked for.

1653
02:15:13,944 --> 02:15:17,194
We will discuss about the rest later.

1654
02:15:17,319 --> 02:15:20,319
Donâ€™t do anything to my brother-in-law.

1655
02:15:20,611 --> 02:15:21,319
Okay?

1656
02:15:21,778 --> 02:15:24,069
Areyreyâ€¦ I just killed him bro.

1657
02:15:26,069 --> 02:15:27,986
You should have called me five minutes ego.

1658
02:15:30,486 --> 02:15:36,778
Life will not come back once it is gone. Right, bro.

1659
02:15:36,819 --> 02:15:37,569
Brother in lawâ€¦

1660
02:15:51,444 --> 02:15:52,819
Why are you silent, bro?

1661
02:15:54,236 --> 02:15:55,944
wondering what that sound is?

1662
02:15:56,611 --> 02:16:00,028
You alone know that I am not scared of anyone.

1663
02:16:00,486 --> 02:16:05,153
Now the entire market will know with this sound.

1664
02:16:06,069 --> 02:16:10,403
Broâ€¦ Just keep this in your head.

1665
02:16:10,903 --> 02:16:13,903
I didnâ€™t come here to mess with anyone

1666
02:16:14,986 --> 02:16:18,986
I came here to rule.
I wonâ€™t compromise.

1667
02:16:19,653 --> 02:16:21,236
What happened?

1668
02:17:19,444 --> 02:17:22,194
Broâ€¦ That Mangalam Srinu is coming.

1669
02:17:23,194 --> 02:17:26,653
He is coming here to die today.
Heyâ€¦ Give me the gun

1670
02:17:27,028 --> 02:17:30,194
Hey Jakka .. you hang on,
I asked Mangalam Srinu to come.

1671
02:17:30,236 --> 02:17:33,819
If you guys fight here, the entire department will be here,

1672
02:17:34,069 --> 02:17:35,694
and I will get everyone killed in an encounter.

1673
02:17:35,819 --> 02:17:37,611
So Let's settle the matter here â€¦

1674
02:18:07,944 --> 02:18:10,569
I will leave if my brother-in-lawâ€™s body is given.

1675
02:18:10,611 --> 02:18:13,111
You can go... but, sit first.

1676
02:18:16,694 --> 02:18:19,486
We were like brothers right.
Then What is this?

1677
02:18:19,569 --> 02:18:22,194
You should ask them all that.
It is they who have started all this.

1678
02:18:22,194 --> 02:18:24,653
What is it about starting?
It will not end till you are killed.

1679
02:18:24,694 --> 02:18:26,611
Hey Jakka. You stop â€¦

1680
02:18:26,986 --> 02:18:29,569
Bro, first ask them why they sold stock to Murugan...

1681
02:18:29,569 --> 02:18:32,778
Yes Bro. They sold the stock to Murugan
without Srinannaâ€™s knowledge

1682
02:18:33,694 --> 02:18:37,403
Ray Jakka, shouldnâ€™t everyone stick to the syndicate?

1683
02:18:37,444 --> 02:18:39,111
Why are you guys doing this?

1684
02:18:49,236 --> 02:18:51,819
How much is this?
- Three crores

1685
02:18:53,153 --> 02:18:54,778
How much? How much did you sell a ton for?

1686
02:18:58,236 --> 02:18:59,361
One and half crore.

1687
02:19:00,861 --> 02:19:02,028
They said 25 lakhs for ton?

1688
02:19:02,194 --> 02:19:05,278
What is this?
Is this true?

1689
02:19:05,278 --> 02:19:07,236
I will give all these calculations later

1690
02:19:07,903 --> 02:19:12,778
but what is this man? You not only killed by brother-in-law,
you are also complaining against me

1691
02:19:12,778 --> 02:19:18,236
Hey, I didnâ€™t kill your brother-in-law.
I killed the person who killed Kondareddy Bro.

1692
02:19:19,028 --> 02:19:22,486
Do you think I will sit silently and watch
when someone attacks Jakkareddy bro with a knife?

1693
02:19:22,611 --> 02:19:24,903
I shot him.

1694
02:19:24,986 --> 02:19:26,819
You hold on man
- Even I wonâ€™t leave.. I will also kill.

1695
02:19:26,819 --> 02:19:28,944
What bro? Looks like both brothers-in-lawâ€™s are alike ...
Do you think we are scared?

1696
02:19:29,028 --> 02:19:31,194
What, you will kill? that too in front me.

1697
02:19:32,028 --> 02:19:34,819
Why are you giving the gun?
What is this? Why are you silent?

1698
02:19:35,444 --> 02:19:40,361
I called him when he was about to kill
my brother-in-law. Still he killed him.

1699
02:19:40,528 --> 02:19:43,194
Maybe you also called five minutes late like me.

1700
02:19:44,736 --> 02:19:46,236
But anyways, both sides have lost right?

1701
02:19:47,153 --> 02:19:50,778
Hey, put that gun away and first explain the calculations.

1702
02:19:52,736 --> 02:19:55,528
Till now you said, 25 lakhs per ton.. right?

1703
02:19:55,944 --> 02:19:57,569
Then how did he get a crore and half now?

1704
02:19:57,944 --> 02:19:59,194
We also asked him the same Sir?

1705
02:19:59,194 --> 02:20:02,153
Had he answered this, we wouldnâ€™t have gone to Murugan
and things wouldnâ€™t have come to this

1706
02:20:02,278 --> 02:20:05,028
This big man has screwed all of us so badly

1707
02:20:05,861 --> 02:20:09,319
What bro Srinu? Why are you silent?
Why donâ€™t you answer when MLA sir is asking you?

1708
02:20:09,444 --> 02:20:11,903
What is this? Should I explain accounts now?

1709
02:20:12,153 --> 02:20:14,111
Have you guys forgotten what all I did so far?

1710
02:20:14,278 --> 02:20:17,319
True Bro. Why are you asking
Srinanna accounts now?

1711
02:20:17,611 --> 02:20:19,569
How many people did he manageâ€¦?

1712
02:20:19,569 --> 02:20:21,528
How many check-posts he managed?

1713
02:20:21,528 --> 02:20:23,486
Wonâ€™t you take all that into account?

1714
02:20:23,486 --> 02:20:26,569
Hello Sir. We are coming there only.

1715
02:20:26,986 --> 02:20:29,944
You are paying off the police.
We are also paying off the police.

1716
02:20:30,028 --> 02:20:32,944
All of you are giving commissions.
Above that, we are also giving commissions

1717
02:20:33,069 --> 02:20:39,694
we are also giving commissions to people
in Forest, revenue, ID,â€¦ how will it work out?

1718
02:20:40,028 --> 02:20:42,236
We, together should pay them once only.

1719
02:20:42,528 --> 02:20:44,778
Then see how much will we save?

1720
02:20:45,028 --> 02:20:46,861
Twenty-five percent.

1721
02:20:47,153 --> 02:20:48,569
Which we were wasting.

1722
02:20:49,694 --> 02:20:53,444
Just by bypassing Seenanna and going directly
to Murugan, he paid us one and half crore.

1723
02:20:53,736 --> 02:20:58,069
If we all unite and fix a rate,
he will pay two crores at least.

1724
02:20:58,153 --> 02:20:59,778
What? two crores??

1725
02:20:59,819 --> 02:21:02,111
Bro, the story doesnâ€™t stop here ...

1726
02:21:02,194 --> 02:21:05,278
There is Chatterjee in Calcutta,
and who is that in Mumbai? Ya.. Singh,

1727
02:21:05,278 --> 02:21:08,361
then Agarwal in Delhi.
I kept more people like them, in line.

1728
02:21:09,153 --> 02:21:12,944
Bro, we have the kind of stock
that is not available anywhere in the world.

1729
02:21:12,944 --> 02:21:14,819
We have it here in Tirupati in our Andhra Pradesh.

1730
02:21:15,069 --> 02:21:17,069
The kind that no one on this earth has.

1731
02:21:17,194 --> 02:21:19,986
With that kind of stock we have,
why should we go and ask them.

1732
02:21:19,986 --> 02:21:23,153
We should demand and create competition
amongst the buyers in the market,

1733
02:21:23,153 --> 02:21:25,194
Then they will buy our stock standing in Queue.

1734
02:21:25,278 --> 02:21:27,986
We may get three crores per ton also.

1735
02:21:28,778 --> 02:21:32,986
If we go by that, our MP sir may get
at least 20 crores as commission.

1736
02:21:36,944 --> 02:21:40,028
Yes, Pushpa said it correctly,

1737
02:21:40,986 --> 02:21:44,236
If we hand over the syndicate to a person like this,
our business will be good

1738
02:21:44,236 --> 02:21:47,861
Itâ€™s easy to speak sitting on the shore.

1739
02:21:47,861 --> 02:21:50,236
You will know the depth when you get into the water.

1740
02:21:52,236 --> 02:21:54,486
Pushpa Come man.
Sit down and tell the whole thing to MP sir...

1741
02:21:59,986 --> 02:22:02,028
Give me one chance, Sir.

1742
02:22:02,611 --> 02:22:05,444
I will make sure that we see the
kind of profits that we have never seen.

1743
02:22:07,403 --> 02:22:08,778
What are you thinking Sir?

1744
02:22:09,319 --> 02:22:10,694
Are you thinking, where is my confidence is coming from?

1745
02:22:11,403 --> 02:22:13,861
None of the stock I have transported so far was ever caught.

1746
02:22:14,444 --> 02:22:17,361
That is my capital.
Trust me, Sir.

1747
02:22:18,611 --> 02:22:21,319
All of you are going with him just because he sold two tons for more.

1748
02:22:21,778 --> 02:22:25,111
Two people are also dead in the last two months
since he has entered the business,

1749
02:22:26,236 --> 02:22:30,403
just think, how many more dead bodies
will we see In the coming days.

1750
02:22:31,236 --> 02:22:35,069
What bro? do you want to believe everything this
youngster said and put the business in his hands?

1751
02:22:35,069 --> 02:22:38,653
Bro, I am not totally convinced.
-If we trust him, we all will go bankrupt.

1752
02:22:38,736 --> 02:22:41,194
Yes bro, Even Iâ€™m getting doubts

1753
02:22:43,236 --> 02:22:45,694
Everything he did is right in front of our eyes,
canâ€™t you all see it?

1754
02:22:47,569 --> 02:22:50,153
Pushpa will manage the syndicate from now onwards.

1755
02:22:50,403 --> 02:22:53,403
Everyone should sell their stock to Pushpa only.

1756
02:22:59,069 --> 02:23:00,861
We will have an oath taking ceremony in Kanipakam tomorrow.

1757
02:23:06,944 --> 02:23:08,444
Take this cash and go.

1758
02:23:16,319 --> 02:23:19,736
MP Sir, If they give me my brother-in-lawâ€™s body,

1759
02:23:20,319 --> 02:23:21,736
I will go home

1760
02:23:22,069 --> 02:23:25,986
Bro, From the time you came in,
you are sitting on his body only.

1761
02:23:25,986 --> 02:23:28,361
We will send his body safely home if you get up.

1762
02:23:29,028 --> 02:23:31,403
Hey Selva, help Seenanna in the preparations.

1763
02:23:58,361 --> 02:24:00,944
That side is mine... This side is mine...

1764
02:24:01,278 --> 02:24:03,819
The piece of sky above my head is also mine

1765
02:24:09,319 --> 02:24:11,986
That wrong is mine... This right is mine.

1766
02:24:12,194 --> 02:24:14,861
The fire that burns the right and wrong is also me

1767
02:24:20,319 --> 02:24:25,194
The one who can defeat me is not yet born on the earth
Even If he is born, it would be me again

1768
02:24:25,903 --> 02:24:30,694
There is only one who can grow beyond me
And thatâ€™s me, myself in the future

1769
02:24:31,278 --> 02:24:34,153
If I twirl, itâ€™s my mustache
And I hold Axe in my handâ€¦

1770
02:24:34,153 --> 02:24:37,028
Whatever I do is the war
And I never negotiate

1771
02:24:39,736 --> 02:24:42,153
Hey Sonâ€¦ This is my bastion

1772
02:24:45,069 --> 02:24:47,736
Hey Sonâ€¦ This is my bastion

1773
02:24:50,903 --> 02:24:53,569
Hey Sonâ€¦ This is my bastion

1774
02:24:56,028 --> 02:24:58,694
Hey Sonâ€¦ This is my bastion

1775
02:25:01,403 --> 02:25:03,069
Will throw you in the lake

1776
02:25:04,194 --> 02:25:05,903
And I return with a fish

1777
02:25:06,944 --> 02:25:08,653
Will stick you to a pole

1778
02:25:09,569 --> 02:25:11,486
And I hoist like a flag

1779
02:25:12,486 --> 02:25:15,111
Will bury you in the soil and make you disappear

1780
02:25:15,153 --> 02:25:19,528
I will be found again as an expensive ore

1781
02:25:20,944 --> 02:25:23,403
Hey Sonâ€¦ This is my bastion

1782
02:25:26,486 --> 02:25:28,944
Hey Sonâ€¦ This is my bastion

1783
02:25:31,778 --> 02:25:34,236
Hey Sonâ€¦ This is my bastion

1784
02:25:44,569 --> 02:25:45,736
Open it.

1785
02:26:19,486 --> 02:26:21,028
What is this Draccha?

1786
02:26:21,444 --> 02:26:23,819
It is six months since my brother died.

1787
02:26:24,194 --> 02:26:28,778
And you are sleeping like a log since then.
How can you?

1788
02:26:29,403 --> 02:26:31,111
What should I do?

1789
02:26:31,778 --> 02:26:34,694
That Pushpa has grown too big,

1790
02:26:34,944 --> 02:26:36,778
and MLA has also become a minister.

1791
02:26:37,194 --> 02:26:40,778
We canâ€™t do anything till the government changes ...
We canâ€™t do anything..

1792
02:26:41,319 --> 02:26:46,278
Then you should have waited till the
government changed to send my brother to him.

1793
02:26:47,278 --> 02:26:51,611
Did I send him to get killed? I Sent him to kill ...

1794
02:26:51,944 --> 02:26:55,069
What should I do if he died because of his incapability?

1795
02:26:56,361 --> 02:27:01,111
If so, you also couldnâ€™t kill him ..
Then, why are you still alive?

1796
02:27:01,153 --> 02:27:02,194
What is this Draksha?

1797
02:27:02,611 --> 02:27:04,861
Why are you still alive?

1798
02:27:10,694 --> 02:27:11,361
Hey!

1799
02:27:11,778 --> 02:27:12,444
Hey!

1800
02:27:14,486 --> 02:27:15,736
Come fast...

1801
02:27:18,028 --> 02:27:19,528
Hey you idiotic Husband â€¦

1802
02:27:19,528 --> 02:27:20,736
Come back if you are alive

1803
02:27:20,736 --> 02:27:22,861
We will together take revenge..

1804
02:27:22,861 --> 02:27:25,903
or else I will go alone and kill him ...

1805
02:27:25,903 --> 02:27:28,236
Who are you? Who are you?

1806
02:27:28,694 --> 02:27:30,569
Iâ€™m the iron Iâ€™m the iron

1807
02:27:30,903 --> 02:27:33,361
I will become a knife if Iâ€™m put under fire

1808
02:27:37,028 --> 02:27:39,361
Who are you? Who are you?

1809
02:27:39,444 --> 02:27:41,444
Iâ€™m the soil Iâ€™m the soil

1810
02:27:41,903 --> 02:27:44,528
I will become a brick if you crush me

1811
02:27:47,778 --> 02:27:50,111
Who are you? Who are you?

1812
02:27:50,528 --> 02:27:52,528
Iâ€™m the rock... Iâ€™m the rock.

1813
02:28:23,611 --> 02:28:25,194
It seems that Puspa is getting married on the 11th

1814
02:28:26,569 --> 02:28:28,028
This is not going to happen.

1815
02:28:28,028 --> 02:28:33,361
I will become the god for sure If you hurt me.

1816
02:28:33,611 --> 02:28:36,153
Hey Sonâ€¦ This is my bastion

1817
02:28:39,236 --> 02:28:41,778
Hey Sonâ€¦ This is my bastion

1818
02:28:44,611 --> 02:28:47,153
Hey Sonâ€¦ This is my bastion

1819
02:28:49,861 --> 02:28:52,528
Hey Sonâ€¦ This is my bastion

1820
02:29:04,403 --> 02:29:11,153
With regret, Govindappa resigns and leaves,
claiming responsibility for Bhujanga's murder

1821
02:29:12,319 --> 02:29:17,611
Even though Jal Reddy wants take revenge badly,
he was not in a state to get up.

1822
02:29:18,486 --> 02:29:24,361
Burning with vengeance, Dakshayani was left helpless..

1823
02:29:25,778 --> 02:29:30,944
when everyone thought that no one can touch Pushpa.

1824
02:29:30,986 --> 02:29:35,153
The new person arrived.
And the whole story changed

1825
02:30:50,694 --> 02:30:51,819
It is strong

1826
02:30:52,486 --> 02:30:54,444
Is it Sheelavathi or what?
- Yes sir ...

1827
02:30:55,819 --> 02:30:56,486
Come!

1828
02:31:08,944 --> 02:31:12,278
Kupparaju Sir, Sheelavathi is strong

1829
02:31:12,653 --> 02:31:14,236
You get good quality here, Sir

1830
02:31:16,194 --> 02:31:18,069
Thatâ€™s why I got asleep,

1831
02:31:21,986 --> 02:31:27,403
it came and It will come.

1832
02:31:28,444 --> 02:31:31,486
Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m falling asleepâ€¦ I will sleep.

1833
02:31:46,944 --> 02:31:49,528
Did you give this to me?
- yes sir

1834
02:31:50,903 --> 02:31:53,319
What is your name?
- Mallesh sir.

1835
02:31:53,694 --> 02:31:55,486
What?
- Mallesh sir.

1836
02:32:21,153 --> 02:32:22,528
What is your name?

1837
02:32:24,069 --> 02:32:27,694
- De ... De ... Devaraju Sir ...

1838
02:32:29,944 --> 02:32:31,069
Devaraju Sir ...

1839
02:32:35,486 --> 02:32:38,611
Sirâ€¦Sir ... Sir ... SP sir ...

1840
02:32:39,028 --> 02:32:41,694
Heard, that you arrested 12 cannabis smugglers.
How,? Sir..

1841
02:32:41,944 --> 02:32:44,319
10 people, not 12 ...

1842
02:32:44,486 --> 02:32:46,819
two fled ...

1843
02:32:46,861 --> 02:32:48,486
They did not run away ...
they were killed.

1844
02:32:48,486 --> 02:32:49,278
Shut up!

1845
02:32:49,278 --> 02:32:50,944
Sir... sir... did you kill them?

1846
02:32:50,986 --> 02:32:55,861
Sir ... he says they were exactly 12 people ...
we also have the same information. Where are the other two?

1847
02:32:55,861 --> 02:32:57,653
Sir ... sir ... they were killed sir ... killed sir..

1848
02:32:57,694 --> 02:33:04,486
Didnâ€™t I say that two of them have fled? He is a smuggler...
He doesnâ€™t know the math. I will teach him now

1849
02:33:04,694 --> 02:33:06,111
Sirâ€¦ what they are saying, is true?

1850
02:33:06,403 --> 02:33:07,653
Sir Media is asking

1851
02:33:07,861 --> 02:33:12,819
The new SP has come. Iâ€™m going to give him the card.
I will meet you once on the way.

1852
02:33:12,861 --> 02:33:15,236
Why do you want to meet?

1853
02:33:15,444 --> 02:33:16,944
I just want to talk

1854
02:33:16,986 --> 02:33:19,528
Just talk?
Will you sit silently once you come?

1855
02:33:19,528 --> 02:33:21,278
A lot will happen after that

1856
02:33:21,569 --> 02:33:24,278
I just want to talk to you and leave.
I will just talk and leave

1857
02:33:24,361 --> 02:33:29,153
What? You will see and go is it,
as if I donâ€™t know what you will do.

1858
02:33:30,944 --> 02:33:35,444
You will tempt me and leave.
I will go sleepless after that.

1859
02:33:35,528 --> 02:33:37,194
Dear, why are you objecting when I say that
I will meet you and once and leave?

1860
02:33:37,194 --> 02:33:38,153
Hey â€¦ Where are you going?

1861
02:33:38,153 --> 02:33:39,153
I have a small work

1862
02:33:39,361 --> 02:33:42,153
Heyâ€¦ You should not go out of home
once we make you a bridegroom.

1863
02:33:42,153 --> 02:33:44,986
Not good for the home.
You tell him, dear

1864
02:33:45,278 --> 02:33:47,528
What ... what is this old womanâ€™s torture?

1865
02:33:47,528 --> 02:33:50,903
Dearâ€¦ Listen to what Iâ€™m telling you ...
I donâ€™t know why but my mind is suspecting harm.

1866
02:33:51,611 --> 02:33:53,903
This is the first holy occasion
happening in my life, my dear son ...

1867
02:33:54,236 --> 02:33:55,611
Pushpa, listen to me.

1868
02:33:56,444 --> 02:33:57,111
Pushpa.

1869
02:33:57,611 --> 02:33:58,319
Come...

1870
02:34:02,653 --> 02:34:05,153
This is the First-time meeting with the newly appointed SP.

1871
02:34:05,569 --> 02:34:06,028
Sir...

1872
02:34:06,569 --> 02:34:07,611
I brought coffee

1873
02:34:07,611 --> 02:34:08,444
Keep it there

1874
02:34:08,819 --> 02:34:11,569
Had to bend to see him.

1875
02:34:18,778 --> 02:34:20,028
He is only Pushpa Sir.

1876
02:34:20,111 --> 02:34:21,194
I told you about.

1877
02:34:21,486 --> 02:34:23,778
He looks after the entire red sandal syndicate.

1878
02:34:24,319 --> 02:34:26,486
He came to see you, Sir.

1879
02:34:27,944 --> 02:34:30,694
Hello SPâ€¦What is your name?

1880
02:34:31,569 --> 02:34:35,861
Banâ€¦var sing Skivaâ€¦skyavathaa

1881
02:34:36,153 --> 02:34:37,278
whatever it is...

1882
02:34:38,486 --> 02:34:41,486
I getting married tomorrow.

1883
02:34:41,569 --> 02:34:42,903
Somehow youâ€¦

1884
02:34:45,028 --> 02:34:47,153
should manage and come.

1885
02:34:50,778 --> 02:34:52,653
Every month we will send you commission sir.

1886
02:34:52,819 --> 02:34:54,069
This is this monthâ€™s commissionâ€¦

1887
02:35:58,153 --> 02:35:59,986
One short!

1888
02:36:03,069 --> 02:36:04,528
One short

1889
02:36:05,194 --> 02:36:05,861
Sir?

1890
02:36:06,944 --> 02:36:08,403
One short

1891
02:36:08,569 --> 02:36:10,569
No Sir, it is all correct.

1892
02:36:16,861 --> 02:36:18,319
One short

1893
02:36:22,861 --> 02:36:24,153
Guys, come on...

1894
02:36:27,319 --> 02:36:30,903
Shall I tell what is the difference
between thief and Police.

1895
02:36:31,319 --> 02:36:34,319
He wore a white shirtâ€¦ I too wore a white shirt,

1896
02:36:34,403 --> 02:36:38,944
and both look similarâ€¦ but there is a difference.

1897
02:36:41,194 --> 02:36:44,069
This one has a half-inch stamp. Lookâ€¦

1898
02:36:44,569 --> 02:36:45,444
Yes Sirâ€¦

1899
02:36:46,069 --> 02:36:47,194
That is a brand.

1900
02:36:48,819 --> 02:36:50,028
you know what brand is right

1901
02:36:50,028 --> 02:36:50,903
Yes Sir.

1902
02:36:52,028 --> 02:36:56,236
In Tamil, you call it (Surname) ayina Peyar

1903
02:36:56,778 --> 02:36:57,528
No sir.

1904
02:36:58,528 --> 02:36:59,528
Nona Peyar

1905
02:36:59,528 --> 02:37:01,028
No Sir

1906
02:37:01,444 --> 02:37:02,403
naina peyar (surname)â€¦

1907
02:37:02,403 --> 02:37:03,069
Yes sir.

1908
02:37:03,611 --> 02:37:05,361
It is like a surnameâ€¦

1909
02:37:06,944 --> 02:37:09,736
It means a stamp that tells who manufactured this...

1910
02:37:10,903 --> 02:37:13,903
who gave birth.

1911
02:37:17,361 --> 02:37:20,569
This one has the stamp,

1912
02:37:22,236 --> 02:37:23,444
Thatâ€™s why it has value.

1913
02:37:24,694 --> 02:37:28,653
That one doesnâ€™t have hence it doesnâ€™t have value.

1914
02:37:30,736 --> 02:37:32,403
The count is right sir.

1915
02:37:33,653 --> 02:37:35,778
There is One short.

1916
02:37:38,903 --> 02:37:43,361
If we have a value, we will know the
value of the other person.

1917
02:37:45,736 --> 02:37:47,528
Tell us how much money is short sirâ€¦

1918
02:37:47,861 --> 02:37:48,694
we will give

1919
02:37:48,986 --> 02:37:50,819
Mr. Kuppu Rajuâ€¦
-Sir!

1920
02:37:51,861 --> 02:37:52,819
Handcuff him.

1921
02:38:02,194 --> 02:38:05,611
If I arrest you now and charge you with PD act,

1922
02:38:06,319 --> 02:38:08,069
do you know how many years you will you be jailed?

1923
02:38:08,319 --> 02:38:09,153
Three years Sir.

1924
02:38:09,278 --> 02:38:10,194
Three yearsâ€¦

1925
02:38:10,528 --> 02:38:11,903
Your wedding on the 11th, right?

1926
02:38:12,028 --> 02:38:16,986
If you go to jail now, when will you get married?

1927
02:38:18,153 --> 02:38:19,819
After three yearsâ€¦

1928
02:38:20,194 --> 02:38:27,111
It means I will decide when you will get married.

1929
02:38:27,778 --> 02:38:30,111
This is Banwar singh value

1930
02:38:30,528 --> 02:38:32,486
If you are married nowâ€¦

1931
02:38:32,736 --> 02:38:37,736
When will your wife become pregnantâ€¦

1932
02:38:39,319 --> 02:38:40,653
After one monthâ€¦

1933
02:38:41,903 --> 02:38:43,194
a man

1934
02:38:44,278 --> 02:38:45,944
Pushpa is a manâ€¦

1935
02:38:47,319 --> 02:38:50,361
If you go to jail when will she become pregnant.

1936
02:38:59,361 --> 02:39:01,903
What? tightening fists?

1937
02:39:03,111 --> 02:39:04,194
Getting angry?

1938
02:39:05,736 --> 02:39:06,569
open itâ€¦ open it

1939
02:39:08,944 --> 02:39:11,319
You donâ€™t have that much luxury with policeâ€¦

1940
02:39:11,319 --> 02:39:13,653
Open your handsâ€¦ Open themâ€¦

1941
02:39:14,861 --> 02:39:15,736
Open themâ€¦

1942
02:39:21,069 --> 02:39:22,403
Open themâ€¦

1943
02:39:24,236 --> 02:39:25,153
Shh!

1944
02:39:25,444 --> 02:39:27,153
Did you understand what was short?

1945
02:39:32,111 --> 02:39:33,569
Hey, you guys hold on.

1946
02:39:39,611 --> 02:39:42,444
Pushpaâ€™s count never wrong.

1947
02:39:45,569 --> 02:39:48,069
Tell me what is short for you sirâ€¦

1948
02:39:49,069 --> 02:39:49,819
What?

1949
02:39:51,319 --> 02:39:54,236
What is short for you please tell me sir?

1950
02:40:02,861 --> 02:40:08,194
What is short for you please tell me sir?

1951
02:40:08,194 --> 02:40:09,069
Sirâ€¦

1952
02:40:11,278 --> 02:40:13,153
That was short.

1953
02:40:13,944 --> 02:40:23,444
I told you one short; one short right. â€˜Sirâ€™, was short.

1954
02:40:24,278 --> 02:40:26,778
shouldnâ€™t sayâ€¦ â€œYou should attend the weddingâ€

1955
02:40:27,653 --> 02:40:32,111
You should say â€œattend the wedding Sirâ€

1956
02:40:35,694 --> 02:40:37,403
Mr. Kuppuraju â€¦
-Sirâ€¦

1957
02:40:38,236 --> 02:40:39,319
Uncuff him.

1958
02:40:42,861 --> 02:40:43,986
Now the count is correct.

1959
02:40:45,069 --> 02:40:46,236
Bagâ€¦bagâ€¦bagâ€¦

1960
02:40:46,778 --> 02:40:51,194
from now on, along with the cash, sir also should come.

1961
02:40:53,153 --> 02:40:59,236
How much sir should take and
how much you will get will be decided by sir.

1962
02:40:59,736 --> 02:41:02,278
Shekhawat sir will decide.

1963
02:41:07,653 --> 02:41:08,569
Pushpa!

1964
02:41:13,361 --> 02:41:14,819
This is my gift for your wedding.

1965
02:41:16,694 --> 02:41:19,069
Buy clothesâ€¦branded ones.

1966
02:41:21,653 --> 02:41:22,861
I gave you a gift.

1967
02:41:24,444 --> 02:41:25,819
Wonâ€™t you give me a party, Pushpa?

1968
02:41:26,153 --> 02:41:27,361
Donâ€™t know why?

1969
02:41:27,569 --> 02:41:30,069
Pushpa used to do whatever
Shekakavat said from then onwards.

1970
02:41:30,069 --> 02:41:31,653
He used to follow his orders religiously.

1971
02:41:31,736 --> 02:41:34,361
Never seen Pushpa bend before anyone till then.

1972
02:41:34,403 --> 02:41:36,944
This is the first time he was doing so.

1973
02:41:38,194 --> 02:41:40,486
We used to wonder why he is behaving like that.

1974
02:41:41,903 --> 02:41:45,778
That day, a little before Pushpaâ€™s wedding muhurtham,

1975
02:41:45,778 --> 02:41:47,486
Priest called for the bridegroom.

1976
02:41:49,319 --> 02:41:50,444
When we went in to call him,

1977
02:41:52,278 --> 02:41:53,444
Pushpa was not there.

1978
02:41:54,694 --> 02:41:55,819
Even his motorcycle was also not there.

1979
02:42:05,319 --> 02:42:07,736
Wow!!â€¦ What is this Sir?

1980
02:42:10,194 --> 02:42:11,486
What is this Sir?

1981
02:42:11,736 --> 02:42:13,569
Never thought you have a funny side too, Sir.

1982
02:42:15,319 --> 02:42:19,569
Singing like a Romeo..

1983
02:42:19,944 --> 02:42:24,861
But that day you scared me with a mask of a tiger.

1984
02:42:25,319 --> 02:42:26,944
Had to scare Pushpa.

1985
02:42:27,528 --> 02:42:31,069
Only then you came know how to behave with me.

1986
02:42:31,528 --> 02:42:34,986
See now we are drinking together happily.

1987
02:42:36,236 --> 02:42:37,236
Where is Pushpa?

1988
02:42:37,236 --> 02:42:39,903
Where did he go?
Auspicious time is nearing..

1989
02:42:42,903 --> 02:42:45,528
Not able to connect. Calling him
-Call him again.

1990
02:42:47,278 --> 02:42:50,194
What Pushpa? Today is your wedding, right?

1991
02:42:50,444 --> 02:42:52,319
And you are here only. Is it ok?

1992
02:42:53,028 --> 02:42:54,028
Sir!

1993
02:42:54,611 --> 02:42:59,861
The wedding can happen.
The bride will be there even if I go half an hour late.

1994
02:43:01,111 --> 02:43:08,611
But you Shekhawat Sir, gave me time to speak to you.

1995
02:43:09,694 --> 02:43:12,444
When you referred to the wedding,
I remembered one thing.

1996
02:43:12,653 --> 02:43:19,236
You said, you will decide when my wife should get pregnant,
and at what time she should get pregnant.

1997
02:43:20,528 --> 02:43:23,069
Why did you say that Sir?
I felt very bad.

1998
02:43:24,861 --> 02:43:27,319
Tell me why did you say that Sir?

1999
02:43:27,903 --> 02:43:30,444
Why are you spoiling the party mood?

2000
02:43:30,861 --> 02:43:32,194
Why all that now.

2001
02:43:33,111 --> 02:43:33,778
Itâ€™s ok sir.

2002
02:43:34,319 --> 02:43:36,944
You must have said that to hurt me.

2003
02:43:37,611 --> 02:43:38,819
Thatâ€™s it, right sir? Leave it.

2004
02:43:40,069 --> 02:43:40,944
But...

2005
02:43:42,778 --> 02:43:49,069
I didnâ€™t like the way you insulted my mother Sir

2006
02:43:49,528 --> 02:43:51,694
What did I say about your mother Pushpa?

2007
02:43:54,444 --> 02:43:59,153
You know that I donâ€™t have a surname right, Sir?

2008
02:43:59,778 --> 02:44:03,694
In spite of that, you insulted me
by saying who manufactured me â€¦

2009
02:44:03,694 --> 02:44:08,986
who gave birth.
Stamp, Stampâ€¦ thisâ€¦that. Right Sir?

2010
02:44:09,819 --> 02:44:12,069
What is this Pushpa?
Why are you spoiling the party mood?

2011
02:44:12,778 --> 02:44:14,069
Why all that now?

2012
02:44:15,319 --> 02:44:20,569
When someone speaks about my surname,
it is like insulting my birth.

2013
02:44:21,736 --> 02:44:23,944
And if someone insults my birth...

2014
02:44:25,486 --> 02:44:27,569
it is like insulting my mother.

2015
02:44:28,861 --> 02:44:33,944
Every Idiot insulted me with this
from the time I was born Sir.

2016
02:44:34,444 --> 02:44:35,236
Pushpa.

2017
02:44:36,069 --> 02:44:37,694
You are drunk and speaking nonsense.

2018
02:44:37,694 --> 02:44:39,028
You are tipsy?

2019
02:44:41,694 --> 02:44:44,569
Yes Sir, I had more.

2020
02:44:45,819 --> 02:44:47,278
In that one thing is more.

2021
02:44:47,361 --> 02:44:48,278
What is it?

2022
02:44:49,111 --> 02:44:55,111
Like you, I donâ€™t know how to put
in suspense saying One is moreâ€¦

2023
02:44:55,694 --> 02:44:57,486
There one extra bullet in that sir.

2024
02:45:00,694 --> 02:45:01,361
In this?

2025
02:45:01,778 --> 02:45:02,611
Yes!

2026
02:45:02,861 --> 02:45:03,486
Give me!

2027
02:45:08,444 --> 02:45:10,861
There are six Sirâ€¦
Did you notice it? One is more

2028
02:45:11,111 --> 02:45:12,736
That is Service revolver Pushpa.

2029
02:45:13,361 --> 02:45:15,069
It will have Six bullets only.

2030
02:45:16,194 --> 02:45:21,361
That day when I tightened my fists hearing your words,
you aimed this gun at me right, Sir.

2031
02:45:21,694 --> 02:45:24,819
The bullet that had to go into this remained in this only.

2032
02:45:24,986 --> 02:45:25,986
That one is more

2033
02:45:54,028 --> 02:45:55,694
Do you know what this is Sir?

2034
02:45:57,403 --> 02:46:00,319
This is my fatherâ€™s blood which is flowing in my body.

2035
02:46:01,986 --> 02:46:08,903
My father gave me this even before
my brothers could snatch the surname from me.

2036
02:46:10,986 --> 02:46:13,569
No one can separate this from me.

2037
02:46:14,444 --> 02:46:19,569
This is my brand, Sirâ€¦

2038
02:46:35,236 --> 02:46:37,319
Hey, Shekhawat sirâ€¦ Idiot

2039
02:46:37,778 --> 02:46:41,486
What? did you think I am of a brand
that will get scared of bullet?

2040
02:46:42,278 --> 02:46:45,903
This brand has grown with its own attitude.

2041
02:46:46,986 --> 02:46:52,569
Do you know why Pushpa was silent
that day when you said all that?

2042
02:46:53,653 --> 02:46:55,403
My mother didnâ€™t have a wedding in her life.

2043
02:46:56,403 --> 02:47:00,611
This is the first wedding happening in our house.

2044
02:47:01,819 --> 02:47:06,111
I stopped myself till this hour,
thinking my mother will feel bad if anything happens.

2045
02:47:07,861 --> 02:47:10,069
Now I wonâ€™t hold myself back.

2046
02:47:10,319 --> 02:47:11,361
Greetings!

2047
02:47:12,194 --> 02:47:14,361
Jakka, Sit down.

2048
02:47:18,611 --> 02:47:20,611
Keshava, Where is Pushpa?

2049
02:47:21,569 --> 02:47:25,153
you are not understanding what you are doing

2050
02:47:25,153 --> 02:47:28,528
What is there to understand?
I'll strip you.

2051
02:47:29,028 --> 02:47:30,778
Take it off.

2052
02:47:34,486 --> 02:47:36,903
Pushpa, do you know with whom you are confronting ?

2053
02:47:38,444 --> 02:47:40,236
Bhanwar Singh.

2054
02:47:40,694 --> 02:47:42,986
Bhanwar Singh Shekhawat

2055
02:47:43,319 --> 02:47:44,361
Is it?

2056
02:47:45,111 --> 02:47:46,569
Then remove your pants also

2057
02:47:46,861 --> 02:47:47,778
Why this?

2058
02:47:47,778 --> 02:47:54,278
Pushpa stripped Shekhawat sirâ€™s clothes
and made him stand stark naked..

2059
02:47:54,528 --> 02:47:56,694
imagine how great feels..

2060
02:47:57,569 --> 02:48:00,194
Take it off.

2061
02:48:31,236 --> 02:48:34,986
Did you understand now ? Everyone will feel
the same way when you strip them.

2062
02:48:35,611 --> 02:48:40,403
It can be Shekhawat Sir or Pushpa.

2063
02:48:40,903 --> 02:48:44,028
You donâ€™t have clothes on your body.
I donâ€™t have clothes on my body.

2064
02:48:44,028 --> 02:48:46,194
But there is one difference, do you know it?

2065
02:48:46,944 --> 02:48:49,528
Pushpa started his life like this.

2066
02:48:50,278 --> 02:48:53,736
Do you know what was his range when he was a coolie?

2067
02:48:59,069 --> 02:49:01,153
This was his range

2068
02:49:01,403 --> 02:49:04,361
The range that was then is the same now.

2069
02:49:04,569 --> 02:49:07,986
See, If I go on the road like this also,
they will call me Pushpa.

2070
02:49:08,069 --> 02:49:12,153
If you go on the road like this without a police uniformâ€¦

2071
02:49:12,361 --> 02:49:15,319
even your dog wonâ€™t recognize you.

2072
02:49:17,236 --> 02:49:21,653
Brand is not in the clothes you wear.
It is in your living

2073
02:49:26,319 --> 02:49:27,778
Hey Shekhawat Sir...

2074
02:49:28,111 --> 02:49:29,861
please keep this in your mind

2075
02:49:30,944 --> 02:49:34,611
The load that has to go will go and the
money 'has to come will keep coming

2076
02:49:34,611 --> 02:49:36,236
You wonâ€™t get a rupee.

2077
02:49:37,028 --> 02:49:41,111
You will have just the uniform on your body
but you wonâ€™t have work to do.

2078
02:49:41,903 --> 02:49:47,736
You will only have â€˜Sirâ€™.
I will remove everything else

2079
02:49:48,319 --> 02:49:49,486
See you.

2080
02:50:08,778 --> 02:50:11,653
(Sanskrit Sloka)

2081
02:50:54,194 --> 02:50:56,319
Sorry, Sirâ€¦ Your dog is not recognising you.

2082
02:50:56,611 --> 02:50:58,028
Hey, keep quiet.

2083
02:51:13,778 --> 02:51:14,653
What, dear?

2084
02:51:14,986 --> 02:51:16,403
What is this attire?
Why did you come like this?

2085
02:51:17,569 --> 02:51:18,694
What happened?

2086
02:51:37,486 --> 02:51:38,069
Sir!

2087
02:51:39,736 --> 02:51:42,736
Someone thought Pushpa means flower.

2088
02:51:47,861 --> 02:51:50,028
I showed him that Pushpa means fire.

2089
02:51:50,486 --> 02:51:53,069
Ok. Itâ€™s all over, right?

2090
02:51:56,278 --> 02:51:58,069
Just started

2091
02:51:58,653 --> 02:51:59,528
What happened sir?

2092
02:52:01,528 --> 02:52:02,819
Pushpa!

2093
02:52:07,319 --> 02:52:09,361
Whoever comes...

2094
02:52:11,694 --> 02:52:13,444
Will not budge.
