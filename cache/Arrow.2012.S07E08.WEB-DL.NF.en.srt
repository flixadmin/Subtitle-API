163
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:38,333
trying that old suit
on for size?

164
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,334
Shh, shh. No, no, no.

165
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:40,961
He's absolutely not

166
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,670
just like we don't
do that anymore.

167
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,298
Dinah's right.

168
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,466
I'm very much enjoying not
being in prison.

169
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:47,467
So what now?

170
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,094
I don't know.

171
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,720
Find a different way
to help the city,

172
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,264
way you guys did.

173
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:53,807
What about you, Felicity?

174
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,683
Well, I'm developing a new
security system.

175
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:58,519
Laurel: Well, then I'm sure
it's the best one in town.

176
00:07:58,561 --> 00:07:59,813
We're friends
with her now?

177
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,189
It's more like frenemies.

178
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:03,650
It's a long story.

Relax. I'm just here
keeping up appearances.

D.A., remember?

181
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:08,905
Actually, we should all
really be thanking Laurel.

182
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,907
I mean, she is the one
who did the trade

183
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:12,326
to get Oliver out of prison.

184
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:13,118
Oliver: That's true.

185
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,953
I'm very grateful.

186
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,331
I know that I haven't
always given you

187
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:19,082
the benefit
of the doubt, so...

188
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,335
Well, it was
really Felicity

189
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:24,171
who was willing
to do anything
to stop Diaz.

190

She's ruthless.

Thank you all
for attending this evening.

194
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:33,347
I would like to introduce
this evening's honoree,

195
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:35,349
Mr. Oliver Queen.

[Clears throat]

199
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:49,154
I used to believe
that justice was

200
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:54,534
as simple as putting
criminals behind bars...

201
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:57,620
but then I spent
some time in prison,

202
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,748
and I realized that
the truth is

203
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,459
nowhere near
that black and white.

204
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:04,169
The truth is that
our institutions have

205
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:05,712
a long way to go

206
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:06,963
before they achieve
true justice.

[Attendees shouting
and screaming]

211
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:26,733
The attack perpetrated by
the Green Arrow this evening

212
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:28,818
is further proof
why we, as a city,

213
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,446
cannot trust men
that hide behind masks.

214
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:34,449
There is a reason why the
anti-vigilante law exists.

215
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:35,992
Thank you.

216
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,869
Rene: Look, I know
how this looks,

217
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,871
but this wasn't
the new Green Arrow.

218
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,622
He hasn't murdered
anyone.

219
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,083
That
you know of.

220
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,043
Has anyone actually seen
who's behind the mask?

221
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,254
Well, no. But whoever it is
has been helping the city.

222
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:48,922
And helped us
take down Diaz.

223
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:51,049
This was
cold-blooded murder.

224
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,427
Now, I appreciate how
all of you feel as though

225
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,053
the new Green Arrow
is an ally,

226
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,637
but I would like to be sure.

227
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,889
And how are you
gonna do that

228
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,933
if you're a no-go
on the Arrow?

229
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,809
Is there a law against
me consulting?

230
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,061
You mean an investigative
consultant, like
"The Mentalist"?

231
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,645
I love that show.

232
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,398
I can't think of
a better way to investigate

233
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,066
a copycat Green Arrow than
with the original.

234
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,692
Rene: I can.
With my help,

235
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,528
because I'm not
sitting this one out.

236
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,695
I appreciate it,

237
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:13,947
but there's nothing left
to be done tonight,

238
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,532
so go home.

239
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:16,657
Let my guys work the scene.

240
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,535
And if I need help, I'll
call you tomorrow.

241
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:26,084
Rene: This is everything
Dinah's compiled
on the vigilante...

242
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,627
every sighting, targets.

243
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,254
It's all there.

244
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:30,755
It says here
the SCPD

245
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,090
nearly arrested him
last month.

246
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,592
But he had
an accomplice?

247
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,802
Uh, yeah, that...
that was me.

248
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:37,262
I, uh,

249
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,431
I didn't want Dinah
to lock him up.

250
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:41,141
Oh, I bet she really
appreciated that.

251
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,267
She threw my ass in jail.

252
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:43,935
I'm really sad
I missed that.

253
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:46,187
What else do we
know?

254
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:47,897
Rene: Uh, he's definitely
not a rookie. I know that.

255
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:50,484
I mean, the guy's efficient,
disciplined, precise.

256
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:51,901
I mean,
he works the bow and arrow

257
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,570
about as well as you do.

258
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:54,862
That takes

259
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,864
a very specific
type of training.

260
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,785
Dinah: Hey. Sorry I'm late.

261
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,496
Pollard's on the warpath.

262
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:05,165
That's OK. Forensics
pull anything
from the scene?

263
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,167
Well, nothing we didn't
already suspect.

264
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,252
Arrows are consistent
with the vigilante.

265
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:10,504
Here. Take a look.

266
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:12,255
Thank you.

267
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:16,134
Oliver: Well, they're both
handmade.

268
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:19,304
The materials in the arrowhead
seem to match.

269
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:20,805
This would be difficult
to replicate.

270
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:23,099
But not impossible,
right?

271
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:24,559
The security camera
footage?

272
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,936
Yeah, but you're
not gonna find much.

273
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:28,771
The killer was
off-camera.

274
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,440
His arrows weren't.

275
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:32,233
If this guy is as precise
with a bow and arrow

276
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:35,153
as Rene says, then he
would've had a target.

277
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,780
Based on the trajectory,
that guy.

278
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,742
Oh, wait a minute. That's...
that's Clayton Ford.

279
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,953
He's a rich dude who
actually helped the Glades.

280
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:45,205
He funded a clinic.

281
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,456
This makes no sense.

282
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:47,790
The vigilante's only
targeted people

283
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,334
who've hurt the Glades.

284
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:50,502
Ford helped it.

285
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:52,671
Then what the hell's
the motive?

286
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:54,422
Sure would help

287
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:55,340
if we could ask
directly.

That was one time,
all right?

292
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,721
And count me out

293
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:03,973
if we're gonna roll up
and arrest him.

294
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:05,808
Dinah: I'm not
talking about
the SCPD.

295
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,144
Just us. We just
need to talk to
the new Green Arrow.

296
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:10,605
Oliver: You think he's
innocent. So we'll be fine.

297
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,773
And what if we aren't?

298
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,442
Then we deal
with him.

299

the call.

how tightly you run
this ship

until you were gone
with the brass.

from the Malcolm Byrd op.

The "Dante" painting.

311
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,224

as some sort of

I don't know, but I might
know how to find out.

the terrorist groups

320

with the financials that
we obtained in Geneva,

321
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,869
I found a common account.

you mine yourself.

483
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:34,966
All it costs me is
the little USB drive

484
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:37,093
I put it on. Scotch?

485
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:39,386
It's a 25-year.

486
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,972
Why not?

487
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:43,349
We can toast your new club.

488
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:47,145
Hey. Toast to
your new prison- and
Green Arrow-free life.

489
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:52,191
It's really got to piss
you off, though, huh?

490
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:54,944
Seeing some lame copycat
screw up

491
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:56,487
everything you
sacrificed for.

492
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,405
I wanted to speak with you
about that.

493
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,574
The last two murders
weren't connected
to the vigilante.

494
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:05,705
So the rumors are true.

495
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:09,249
You are helping the cops
investigate this.

496
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,751
How can I help?

497
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:12,545
You were a member of
the Scroll and Key

498
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:13,838
back at Yale.

499
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,006
Allegedly.

500
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:17,383
It is a secret society.

501
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:18,676
Fair point.

502
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,053
How well did you
know Clayton Ford

503
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:21,303
and Sam Hutchinson?

504
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,805
Clay and Hutch.

505
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,598
Well enough to mourn them.

506
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,059
Mm-hmm.

507
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,935
But we'd sort of fallen
out of touch.

508
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:30,813
Ford looked like he was
trying to skip town

509
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:32,439
before he died,

510
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,900
like he knew the hit
was coming,

511
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,484
but we just...we
don't know how.

512
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:37,195
You're looking for
skeletons.

513
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,863
And are we gonna
find any?

514
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:41,240
I know you're not supposed
to talk ill of the dead

515
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:44,035
or whatever, but, you know,
there were always rumors

516
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:45,828
that they had shady
business dealings going on

517
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,622
with the Triad, I believe.

518
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:52,043
So who knows? Maybe they got
in over their heads.

519
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:53,878
Probably.

520
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,172
I won't take up any
more of your time.

521

Thank you, Max.

522
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,263
You mind if I ask you
a question?

523
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:07,850
They sent you to prison
for helping this city.

524
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:12,146
Why the hell should you
care about any of this?

525
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:13,814
Old habits.

526
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:18,277
I guess some people
don't change
that much after all.

How did things go
with Fuller?

Max Fuller is
hiding something.

into it?

Of course.

Hey, you just came in
the front door,

Who are you?

543
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:34,228
My husband asked you
a question.

Where'd you get that?

as the doc gives the OK,

we'll take him into
the station for questioning.

550

In the meantime, we'll go
through his effects,

551
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,584
see what we can find out.

-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

Oh, hey, and just
a bit of advice.

554

Yeah.

555
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:02,798
You probably shouldn't
be shooting people

-That's a good tip.
-Yeah.

countered my alarm

into the sensors.

561
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,019
That is a design flaw

that could take
weeks to fix.

-We need to talk about this.
-No. We need to be safe.

This security system

565
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:20,482
was supposed to bring
peace of mind.

-You mean like owning a gun?
-Yeah.

Where'd you even get a gun?

Of course not.

00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,288
I've barely been gone
7 months,

573
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,956
and you've aligned yourself

574
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:37,624
with two of the most immoral
people we know?

575

Oliver, you don't
get to judge me.

576

You just shot a man in
our living room.

a million times.

Hey, this isn't you.

You don't obsess over
security.

You certainly
don't carry a gun.

This is me, Oliver,

582
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:52,932
not because I was
influenced by Laurel
or Anatoly.

583
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,558
This is me
because of you.

584
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,434
You were the one
that decided

585
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:58,520
all on your own that
you were going to
sacrifice yourself,

leaving your son
and your wife

alone at home as
sitting ducks for Diaz.

588
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:05,027
And the best part about
the whole thing is that

589
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:06,737
you didn't even
ask us about how we
felt about it.

590

you need me to apologize.

with an apology, Oliver?

I did

selflessness, and loyalty.

no matter what happened,
if one of us was in trouble,

be there.
