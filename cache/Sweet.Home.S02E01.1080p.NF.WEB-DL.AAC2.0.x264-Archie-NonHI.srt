00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:33,783
<i>They complained of frequent nosebleeds</i>

4
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:36,661
<i>It suddenly begins one day</i>

5
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:39,080
<i>and it never stops.</i>

6
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:44,252
<i>They turned into miserable,</i>
<i>desperate beings.</i>

7
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:49,215
Throw it!

8
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,634
<i>We're not gonna be able to overcome this.</i>

9
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,986
Please, help us!

10
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:14,657
<i>I was consumed by it too.</i>
<i>Protect them?</i>

11
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,034
<i>Is that what you want to do?</i>

12
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:21,623
Are you okay?

13
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:22,832
Golden hour saved you.

14
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,627
<i>There was someone out there</i>

15
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,629

16
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:31,132
<i>If they last 15 days</i>
<i>without being consumed,</i>

18
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:36,763
<i>They become unstable beings,</i>

19
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:40,558
<i>something in between</i>
<i>both human and monster.</i>

20
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:44,771
<i>They are called… "special infectees."</i>

21
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:47,190
<i>Hyun-su is dangerous.</i>

22
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,525
<i>He's dangerous, but we need him.</i>

23
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,068
<i>You know he's using you.</i>

24
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,947
You think I'm gonna harm you guys
if I turn back into a monster?

25
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,824
A monster is still a monster.

26
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,035

27
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:00,829

00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,093
<i>Surrender the infected immediately.</i>

29
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:18,471
<i>Survivors will be transferred</i>
<i>to a safety camp.</i>

30
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,223
<i>"Safety camp" sounds ridiculous.</i>

31
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:23,059
<i>You don't know</i>
<i>who'll turn into a monster or when.</i>

32
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,270
<i>So, how can they possibly ensure safety?</i>

33
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:26,187
<i>I'll come back.</i>

34
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:30,191
{\an8}No. Eun-hyeok! Eun-hyeok!

35
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:33,027
You promised me to come back!

<i>I know how he's doing and where he is.</i>

39
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:54,257
<i>Us and humans can't coexist anyway.</i>

40
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,302

{\an8}I've got a pet theory.

58
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:56,152
<i>Our earth was formed</i>
<i>some 4.6 billion years ago,</i>

59
00:03:56,236 --> 00:04:00,156
and we, Homo Sapiens, came around
roughly 200,000 years ago.

60
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:03,743
Now, if that was a day,

61
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:06,704
then we've existed for 0.05 seconds.

62
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,333
Spit it out already.

63
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,585
<i>I'm saying,</i>
<i>from the planet's point of view,</i>

64
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:13,711
<i>we're a speck.</i>

65
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:18,091
But these specks
are starting to be an eyesore.

66
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:22,345
And now they're destroying anything
and everything in their way

67
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,264
all for the sake of greed.

68
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,309
Isn't it about time the Earth had enough?

69
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,689
It's time for new management, and you all,

70
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,483
think it's time to checkout.

Man, was it that obvious?

00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:16,352
That's a bummer.

99
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,546
This is Black Kite Nine.

00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,134
'Cause… 'cause of you.

105
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,304
You see,

106
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:36,057
you pissed me off, that's why.

107
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,070
Die!

108
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,419
This guy's still alive, isn't he?

109
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,004
Just say thanks.

110
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:10,925
You should've been thanking me.

111

<i>The special infectee is confirmed alive!</i>

118

Stop trying to hold it in

No.

120
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:30,940

123
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,432
<i>The vehicle is getting away!</i>

<i>Permission for direct fire.</i>

127
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,337
<i>Negative. The target</i>
<i>must be brought in alive.</i>

128
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,922
<i>He's the last special infectee.</i>

129
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,841

00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,204
<i>We've lost visuals on it.</i>

132
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,165
<i>Check all possible routes</i>
<i>and resume the pursuit.</i>

133
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:15,085
<i>Search the area, pan out,</i>
<i>do a full sweep on every possible route.</i>

134
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:24,053
Don't we have enough monsters
at Central Command? I mean, why are we--

135
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,305
Because he's special!
Half human, half monster.

136
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:28,307
- We need that for a cure.
- Wait.

137
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,100
Was it a success?

138
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:31,393
I don't know.

139
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,480
The monsters at Central Command
are useless now.

140
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,359
They'll all be disposed of.

141
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:40,528
That's why we have to bring 'em in.

142
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,168
The military pulled it off.

143
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,920
Doesn't mean we're safe now.

144
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,506
Well, there wasn't a single monster
the whole way here.

145
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,051
No people too.

146
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,638
Well, uh, um…

147
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:11,308
Oh, the soldiers probably already…

148

<i>Blockade five.</i>

149
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,827
<i>A military vehicle containing survivors</i>

150

<i>We'll inspect the vehicle.</i>

151
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,914
See? What did I tell you?

152
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,683
The vehicle looks clear.
Let them through.

153
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:54,894
<i>Roger.</i>

154
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,342
<i>How long until the debris is cleared?</i>

155
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,594
<i>At least two to three hours.</i>

156
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,305
<i>We're moving the survivors back here then.</i>

157
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:55,412
Oh.

158
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,915
Wait. He's not…

159
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:59,625
He's not… He's just sick!

160
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,335
He has leukemia.

161
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:04,046
There should be a doctor here
who can confirm it for you.

162
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,757
All right. We'll check then.

163
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,181
Tae-yun's gonna be okay, all right?

164
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:23,565
He's dead, sir.
He wasn't a monster.

165
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,110
Some good news. Clean up.

166
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:32,116
- What the hell are you doing?
- Back off now.

167
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:35,494
- Nosebleeds are one of the symptoms.
- You sons of bitches!

168
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,913
You sons of…

169
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,540
Stay down.

170
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,460
Oh, no.

171
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,504
Come on.

172
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,805
No…

173
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,058
Son of a bitch!

174
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,727
Motherfucker!

175
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:00,894
Fucking bastard!

176
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:04,773
Baby!

177
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:05,858
Oh!

178
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,192
{\an8}Oh, you have to stop!

179
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,820
You got to stop, baby.

180
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:14,700
It's mom! This is wrong. You can't…

181
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:17,619
How did this happen to you?

182
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,959
Oh, my baby.

183
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:40,017
Enjoying yourself? Humming and everything.

184
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,519
What the fuck are you saying?

185
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:44,229
That wasn't you?

186
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:49,985
Then what the hell was that?

187
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:00,871
Can you hear it?

188
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,757
- What's going on?
- Move!

189
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,928
Hey! Where are you going?

190
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:17,596
I just…

191
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,139
There were sounds and…

192
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,933
- Scan him.
- He's clean, sir.

193
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,852
So what the fuck was that, huh?

194
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,979
Hey, get back to work right now!

195
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,564
Turn around!

196
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,233
Get over there!

197
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,319
I said move! Go!

198
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:33,946
Ready or not, here I come.

199
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,948
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

200
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:37,950
Hurry up and move!

201
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:58,137
Ready or not, here I come.
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

202
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:04,893
Ready or not, here I come.
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

203
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:11,608
Run!

204
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,059
Run!

205
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:54,169
Ah! Watch out!

206
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:01,093
{\an8}Quiet! Shoot it down!

207
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:35,252
Keep running.

208
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,382
Keep running! Go, run!

209
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,581
Hey, come here!

210
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:13,832
Over here!

211
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,711
Hey, quickly! Hurry up!

212
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,340
Hurry up!

213
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:24,551
Run! Go!

214
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:25,886
- Hurry!
- Hey!

215
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,686
I said drive! Hey!

216
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,647
Start driving,
you son of a bitch!

217
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,416
Let's go already!

218
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,710
Start driving, asshole!

219
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:01,546
Hey! I said start driving!

220
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,438
What the hell are you doing?

221
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:20,834
Mommy!

222
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:44,524
- Mommy!
- He's got a child.

223
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:48,069
Stop shooting! Stop! Don't shoot!

224
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,617
Let go! Let go!

225
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,329
Mommy!

226
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:58,955
Mommy…

227
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,374
Mommy.

228
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:03,001
Yun-seo!

229
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,711
Yun-seo!

230
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:11,134
Yun-seo! Yun-seo!

231
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,345
Oh, my God!

232
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,600
Mommy!

233
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:21,019
Yun-seo! Yun-seo!

234
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:23,939
Mom. Mommy.

235
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,483
Yun… Yun-seo.

236
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:28,610
Yun-seo!

237
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:04,729
Were you trying to get us all killed?

238
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,815
Fucking…

239
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,316
Piece of…

240
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:11,736
Man, even soldiers have it rough.

241
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:13,530
Bom…

242
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:15,240
You piece of…

243
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:16,241
Bom…Where's my…

244
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:18,451
Hey, who gives a fuck
where your dog is, huh?

245
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:21,413
How dare you!
You'd be dead if it wasn't for Bom.

246
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:24,124
I saw you back there!
You didn't lift a finger, did you?

247
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:26,126
So what?
What's wrong with that, huh?

248
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:28,461
- That's like the same thing--
- Stop it, you guys.

249
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:29,671
This isn't the time!

250
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:32,507
What's going to happen to us now?

251
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:36,303
Hey, why do you…

252
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:38,513
Hey.

253
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:44,728
What is this?

254
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:46,938
You don't think I'd fall for that--

255
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,201
What do you want?

256
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:03,830
Gotta get somewhere.

257
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:32,525
That didn't make them pull back?

258
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,361
A bunch of idiots, huh?

259
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:19,614
SPECIAL INFECTEE REPORT GUIDE

260
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:27,038
Sergeant Kim, Sergeant Min.

261
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,708
Take your teams and do a sweep.

262
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:31,876
We'll check the rear.

263
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:45,181
Check it up and down.

264
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:47,058
Call in if you find anything.

265
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,268
<i>Roger.</i>

266
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,866
Sergeant Kim.

267
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:04,993
Doesn't something look off?

268
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:08,663
I mean, take a look at the bodies here.

269
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,666
Almost all of them were shot.

270
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,460
And the creatures?

271
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:16,337
<i>Well, I doubt a monster was the shooter.</i>

272
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:19,340
<i>Plus the bodies aren't torn up either, so…</i>

273
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,718
Well, by the look of things,

274
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,554
I think a monster was here, sir.

275
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:28,683
Most of these bodies
have gunshot wounds, sir.

276
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,060
Maybe it left after causing havoc.

277
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:37,066
Hold it.

278
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:40,361
<i>Sign of a monster in the debris ahead.</i>

279
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,508
Target location confirmed.

280
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:04,385
{\an8}The monster's located inside.
Permission to fire.

281
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:06,179
<i>Granted.</i>

282
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:17,398
That's not the only one.
We got another over here.

283
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:30,328
Cease fire!

284
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:34,851
It's heading your way, Sergeant Kim.

285
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:36,477
<i>Prepare suppressing fire.</i>

286
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:39,814
Get in formation.

287
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,107
Seok-chan, on me!

288
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,754
<i>The monster is on the move.</i>
<i>It's heading rapidly towards the front.</i>

289
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:28,821
Where did this motherfucker
crawl out of, huh?

290
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:45,797
Hey!

291
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,009
Back off or it dies.

292
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:59,268
{\an8}Back off!

293
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:09,696
Hey, Seok-chan, grab it.

294
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:00,830
Enough now.

295
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:14,260
Move.

296
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:01,641
What the hell is this, sir?

297
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,029
I just watched you spare
one of those things right now.

298
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:18,533
"Shoot and kill any and all monsters
on sight." That's our directive.

299
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:22,912
That's the primary objective
of Crow Platoon, am I wrong?

300
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:28,918
Sergeant First Class.

301
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,672
We're here to put down the ones
that attack us, Sergeant.

302
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:34,132
That…

303
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:37,385
is our objective and always was.

304
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:05,288
We only get one shot

305
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,290
at a first impression.

306
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:09,083
We're about to meet others like you.

307
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,336
You know, "infectees."

308
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,589
That name pisses me off though.

309
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:17,008
Any suggestions?

310
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:20,386
Hmm!

311
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:23,264
"Neohumanity."

312
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,562
God, you really look like shit.

313
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:33,983
None of this played out
how I wanted it to.

314
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,611
Sorry.

315
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:39,530
So you weren't planning
on a shopping spree?

316
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,326
Then why exactly am I here?

317
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:47,538
I want you to live.

318
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,833
I think you'd like that
compared to being a rat in the lab.

319
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:55,546
To liberate you, that's why I did this.

320
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,177
Humanity won't give up.

321
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,098
They already had you in their hands,

322
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,768
so I figured
they're taking this personally.

323
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:11,646
It doesn't matter.

324
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:13,648
I chose to do that.

325
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,693
That's right.

326
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:21,614
You walked right into their hands,
didn't you?

327
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:24,784
Why was that?

328
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:27,328
I thought I told you

329
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,664
they'll rip you into pieces.

330
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:30,998
They'll dissect you over and over.

331
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,959
How many more times
do you have to hear that?

332
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:35,628
Is that why you ran away?

333
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:40,341
Because you were afraid of them?

334
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:48,099
I just wanted to live, okay?

335
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:53,980
Try worrying about something else.

336
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:00,611
Saving humans, all that shit,
fuck that, forget all that.

337
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,656
Figure out what you're gonna do
starting now.

338
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:07,451
There's gotta be a reason
you're a neohuman, isn't there?

339
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,663
I'm not going to kill people
just to survive.

340
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:11,789
Not like you.

341
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,542
No, I don't think so.

342
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,597
Oh, God, help me!

343
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:34,979
Please help me!

344
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,399
Somebody please!

345
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:42,528
Please, help me. Help!

346
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,955
Fighting you, I'm past all that.

347
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:55,750
From now on, I'll stop killing wantonly.

348
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:04,550
You mean it?

349
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:06,093
Of course!

350
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,179
I promise I won't attack them first.

351
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,106
If they stay out of my way, they're safe.

352
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:09,657
How are we gonna find them?

353
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:12,201
Others who are like us.

354
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:14,954
That's the beauty of it all.

355
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:17,373
We're going to them right now.

356
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:24,296
Hey, you know that area, Bamseom?

357
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:27,299
They're waiting for us there.

358
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:31,011
I was headed that way already, so…

359
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:35,516
In that case, why did you…

360
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,184
That's not… No, that's not it!

361
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:39,311
That's not it.

362
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,730
That's ridiculous.

363
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:44,358
Them bringing you in there in chains?

364
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:47,027
No, but we're the ones walking in.

365
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:53,492
Aren't you excited?

366
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:56,537
This time,
you'll be rescuing the neohumans.

367
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:59,248
Once you see them, you'll understand.

368
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,460
The reason you were chosen.

369
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:43,501
<i>This is Gate 2.</i>
<i>Unreported Black Kite vehicle approaching.</i>

370
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:49,715
Major.

371
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,259
Weren't you out on a mission, sir?

372
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,761
I have an urgent report.

373
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,722
We're going to have to have you
fill in the entry log before we--

374
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:59,475
I'm sorry?
What part of urgent don't you get?

375
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:16,951
<i>The vehicle is clear.</i>
<i>It's coming through.</i>

376
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:35,469
{\an8}BAMSEOM EMERGENCY
MANAGEMENT BUREAU

377
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,809
How far do you think you're gonna get?

378
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:01,412
You think my men will just stand around
while their commander has gone missing?

379
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:03,122
We got this far, didn't we?

380
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:05,791
Looks to me like no one's filed a report.

381
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:10,462
The military's stretched
too thin to worry about you.

382
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,625
<i>Attention, all units! Alert!</i>

383
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:50,794
<i>Two individuals suspected</i>
<i>of being special infectees</i>

384
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:53,005
<i>approaching Gate 2.</i>

385
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,140
<i>I thought I was over it.</i>

386
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:08,312
I guess it never left me.

387
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,023
It's all clear as day.

388
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,393
<i>In this world…</i>

389
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:52,398
because we don't have much time,

390
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:54,900
{\an8}human beings should be decent
to each other.

391
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:56,443
Get out of my fucking head.

392
00:44:58,237 --> 00:44:59,196
Fuck off!

393
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:04,785
Go away! Go away!

394
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:46,011
Stay away.

395
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,181
Get back! Stay away from me!

396
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:51,475
You monster.

397
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:58,482
Why are you doing this to us?

398
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:15,916
Just kill me already. Just do it!

399
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:21,588
Come on, please, it hurts so much.

400
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:30,889
Mom…

401
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:33,350
Mom…

402
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:30,008
Beginning experiment on Sample D-126.

403
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:50,028
Hui-ji?

404
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:53,573
Hui-ji?

405
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:56,201
Our subject is the mother of D-126.

406
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:58,036
She volunteered for the test.

407
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,247
{\an8}- Classification?
- Type yellow, sir.

408
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,708
{\an8}According to the mother,
it was online harassment.

409
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:05,377
Hui-ji, where are you? It's Mom.

410
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:07,713
Hui-ji?

411
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,382
Hui-ji, Mom's here.

412
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:15,220
Hui-ji?

413
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:21,059
Hui-ji, it's me.

414
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,521
Hui-ji.

415
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:48,545
It appears prior connection
before monsterization don't matter

416
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:49,880
in type yellow either.

417
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:51,548
End of test.

418
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:05,562
Oh! Oh, God! No!

419
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:07,064
No! Don't! Don't do it!

420
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:09,357
Hui-ji! You can't!

421
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:12,110
You can't!

422
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:18,825
Oh, no. Hui-ji!

423
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,619
No! No!

424
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:22,704
You can't!

425
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:25,207
Hui-ji! Hui-ji!

426
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:34,674
Hui-ji…

427
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:37,010
Oh, God!

428
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:44,559
Hui-ji…

429
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:53,568
Oh, Hui-ji!

430
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:19,010
Oh, shit.

431
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:21,596
{\an8}It feels so sick eating this body. Fuck.

432
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,682
{\an8}I shouldn't have fucking even started.

433
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:28,895
Oh, shit, man. The son of a bastard
rubbed me the wrong ways…

434
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:46,079
What the hell, why won't it work?

435
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:50,292
Fuck.

436
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:08,727
Running away again?

437
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:17,027
Fuck it.

438
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:27,495
You said we were chosen, right?

439
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:30,582
Really? We're chosen?

440
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:32,375
More like abandoned.

441
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:35,587
Look at you.

442
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:39,174
You can't survive without a human host.

443
00:53:41,426 --> 00:53:42,385
You see?

444
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:44,679
You're just a parasite.

445
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:46,431
Shut your fucking mouth.

446
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:52,145
Shut the hell up, you fucking disgrace!

447
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:12,624
Come with me.

448
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:14,542
Let go.

449
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:16,544
Let go, motherfucker.

450
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:18,588
Let go of me.

451
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:20,799
Let me go, you son of a bitch.

452
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:23,969
I'm gonna murder you, you bastard.

453
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:27,430
Fucking son of a bitch.

454
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:29,057
Let go.

455
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:31,893
I said let go of me, you fuck.

456
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:35,981
You bastard.
You are so dead when I get my…

457
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:38,233
I'll fucking kill you, you son of a…

458
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:40,860
Just a bit more.

459
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:44,531
I think it's better that we go together.

460
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:46,032
You're fucking crazy.

461
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:49,411
You think
they're gonna just accept you now?

462
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:53,790
Oh, fuck.

463
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:56,584
They're gonna turn you
into a goddamn pincushion,

464
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:59,879
and I know you're gonna regret this
for the rest of your days!

465
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,093
Please.

466
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:07,804
I can't go back there.

467
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:10,307
Not like this. Please.

468
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:13,101
Don't do this, please.

469
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:17,355
Just look at me. Look at me.

470
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:20,191
I can't go back there. Not like this.

471
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:23,194
Please! Please.

472
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:24,779
God, please.

473
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:27,282
Why?

474
00:55:28,366 --> 00:55:31,494
Haven't you done enough already?
Why? Why are you doing this?

475
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:34,664
Huh, why? Why?

476
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:40,754
To make sure I won't forget.

477
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:45,216
So that I'll always know…

478
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:48,178
no matter what…

479
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:51,806
that I'm human.

480
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:38,520
Fine.

481
00:56:39,854 --> 00:56:42,399
You should go to hell because of that.
