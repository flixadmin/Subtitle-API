HANLEY:
Murph is a great kid. She's really bright.

170
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,701
But she's been having a little trouble lately.

171
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:45,246
She brought this in to show the students.
The section on the lunar landings.

172
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,916
Yeah, it's one of my old textbooks.

173
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,376
She always loved the pictures.

174
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:54,255
It's an old federal textbook. We've
replaced them with the corrected versions.

to bankrupt the Soviet Union.

You don't believe we went to the moon?

178
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,564
It was a brilliant piece of propaganda.

179
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,567
The Soviets bankrupted themselves
pouring resources...

180
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,986
...into rockets and other useless machines.

181
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,238
"Useless machines."

182
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:22,492
If we don't want a repeat of the excess
and wastefulness of the 20th century, then...

not tales of leaving it.

One of those useless machines
they used to make was called an MRI.

185

If we had any of those left,
the doctors would've been able to find...

186
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:38,925
...the cyst in my wife's brain
before she died instead of afterwards.

187
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:42,178
Then she'd have been the one
listening to this instead of me...

188
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:45,431
...which would have been a good thing,
because she was always...

189
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,517

with several of her classmates over this...

00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:40,268
So if we find a home...

474
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:46,399
- ...then what?
- That's the long shot.

475
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:49,945
There's a Plan A and a Plan B.

476
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:53,406
Did you notice anything strange
about the launch chamber?

477
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:08,046
COOPER:
This entire facility's a centrifuge.

478
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,882
Some kind of vehicle. A space station?

479
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:12,968
BRAND:
Both. Plan A.

480
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:15,220
How do you get it off the ground?

481
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:19,057
The first gravitational anomalies
changed everything.

482
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:23,728
Suddenly we knew
that harnessing gravity was real.

483
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:28,733
So I started working on a theory
and we started building this station.

484
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:31,194
But you haven't solved it yet.

485
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:33,822
That's why there's Plan B.

486
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:39,035
The problem is gravity. How to get
a viable amount of human life off the planet.

487
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,495
This is one way.

488
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:43,331
Plan B: a population bomb.

489
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:48,420
Over 5,000 fertilized eggs
weighing in at just under 900 kilos.

490
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:50,630
How would you raise them?

491
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:53,258
With equipment on board,
we incubate the first 10.

492
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:57,304
After that, with surrogacy,
the growth becomes exponential.

493
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:01,308
Within 30 years,
we could have a colony of hundreds.

494
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:04,853
The real difficulty with colonization
is genetic diversity.

495
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:07,022
This takes care of that.

496
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,649
But what about the people here? You just...

497
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:11,359
...give up on them?

498
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:13,236
My kids?

499
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:17,115
That's why Plan A is a lot more fun.

500
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:22,245
- How far have you got?
- Almost there.

501
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:24,831
You're asking me to hang everything...

502
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:27,208
...on an almost.

503
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:30,045
I'm asking you to trust me.

504
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:32,964
[SIGHS]

505
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,799
Find us a new home.

506
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,552
And by the time you return...

507
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,805
...I will have solved the problem of gravity.

508
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:43,350
I give you my word.

509
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,489
MURPH:
Go away!

510
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,209
Murph.

511
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:12,587
MURPH:
Go! If you're leaving, just go.

512
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:18,218
DONALD: This world was never enough
for you, was it, Coop?

513
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:22,806
What, because heading out there
is what I feel like I was born to do?

514
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:25,600
And it excites me? Heh.

515
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,770
No, that does not make it wrong.

516
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:30,063
It might.

517
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:33,566
Don't trust the right thing
done for the wrong reason.

518
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,653
The why of the thing, that's the foundation.

519
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,905
And the foundation's solid.

520
00:36:42,075 --> 00:36:47,080
We farmers, we sit here every year
when the rains fail and we say:

521
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:48,623
"Next year."

522
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:52,961
Well, next year ain't gonna save us,
nor the one after that.

523
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:57,924
This world's a treasure, Donald,
but it's been telling us to leave for a while now.

524
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:06,433
Mankind was born on Earth,
it was never meant to die here.

525
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:12,772
Tom will be all right,
but you got to make things right with Murph.

526
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:13,982
I will.

527
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:18,111
Without making promises
you don't know you can keep.

528
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:30,749
You have to talk to me, Murph.

529
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,378
I need to fix this before I go.

530
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:38,423
MURPH:
Then I'll keep it broken so you have to stay.

531
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:45,013
After you kids came along, your mom said
something to me I never quite understood.

532
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:47,015
She said, "Now...

533
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:53,396
...we're just here
to be memories for our kids."

534
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,029
And I think that now I understand
what she meant.

535
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:08,536
Once you're a parent,
you're the ghost of your children's future.

536
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:12,332
You said ghosts didn't exist.

537
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,298
That's right, Murph.

538
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,844
Murph, look at me.

539
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:30,391
I can't be your ghost right now.

540
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:34,187
I need to exist.

541
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:37,732
They chose me.

542
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:42,403
Murph, they chose me. You saw.
You're the one who led me to them.

543
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,534
That's exactly why you can't go.

544
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,705
I figured out the message.

545
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:56,334
- One word. Know what it is?
- Murph.

546
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:57,836
"Stay."

547
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:01,089
- It says, "Stay," Dad.
- Murph.

548
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,508
You don't believe me.

549
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:06,469
Look at the books! Look at this.
It says, "Stay."

550
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:09,597
Why...? You're not listening! It says, "Stay!"

551
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:11,766
No, I'm coming back.

552
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:13,268
When?

553
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:28,741
One for you, one for me.

554
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:32,287
When I'm up there in hypersleep, or...

555
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,164
...traveling near the speed of light, or...

556
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:38,293
...near a black hole...

557
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:43,298
...time's gonna change for me.
It's gonna run more slowly.

558
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:46,676
When we get back...

559
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,220
...we're gonna compare.

560
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:52,015
MURPH: Time will run differently for us?
- Yeah.

561
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:57,770
By the time I get back,
we might even be the same age, you and me.

562
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:00,481
"What?" Imagine that!

563
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:06,195
Aw, Murph...

564
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,990
You have no idea when you're coming back.

565
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:12,285
No idea at all!

566
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,540
Murph, don't... Don't make me leave like this.

567
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:19,208
Come on, Murph!

568
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:22,045
Don't make me leave like this, Murph!

569
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:30,678
Hey...

570
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,555
...I love you.

571
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:34,849
Forever. You hear me?

572
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:38,519
I love you forever, and I'm coming back.

573
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:45,652
I'm coming back.

574
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,047
- How'd it go?
- Fine.

575
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:08,257
Just fine.

576
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:15,848
I love you, Tom.

577
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,518
- Travel safe, huh?
- Yeah.

578
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:20,937
You look after our place for me, all right?

579
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:22,730
- All right?
- Uh-huh.

580
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:30,613
- Hey, can I use your truck while you're gone?
- You mean your truck?

581
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:33,741
I'll make sure they bring it back.

582
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:37,662
Look after my kids, Donald!

583
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:53,761
TARS:
<i>Go for main engine start. T-minus 10...</i>

584
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:56,514
- Dad!
<i>- ...nine...</i>

585
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:57,932
Dad!

586
00:41:58,558 --> 00:41:59,600
<i>...eight...</i>

587
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,020
<i>...seven...</i>

588
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,438
Dad!

589
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:04,814
<i>...six...</i>

590
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:09,110
<i>...five, main engine start, four...</i>

591
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:11,612
<i>...three...</i>

592
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,406
<i>...two...</i>

593
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:16,409
<i>...one. Booster ignition and...</i>

594
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:28,337
All engines look good.
Beginning roll program.

595
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:35,470
Prepare for stage one separation.

596
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:36,846
Stage one.

597
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,645
There is Mach 1.

598
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:49,317
Everybody good?
Plenty of slaves for my robot colony?

599
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:54,489
They gave him a humor setting
so he'd fit in better with his unit.

600
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,491
He thinks it relaxes us.

601
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:59,452
A giant sarcastic robot.

602
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:01,746
What a great idea!

603
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:04,624
TARS: I have a cue light I can use
when I'm joking if you like.

604
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:05,833
That'd probably help.

605
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,921
You can use it to find your way back
to the ship after I blow you out the airlock.

606
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:14,008
- What's your humor setting, TARS?
- That's 100 percent.

607
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:15,968
Let's bring it on down to 75, please.

608
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:18,137
TARS:
Stage two separation.

609
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:30,983
COOPER:
All feeds going manual.

610
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:32,693
MAN:
Going manual.

611
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:37,156
COOPER:
Deactivate probe heater one, two and three.

612
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:38,366
MAN:
Check.

613
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:46,874
- Taking control.
TARS: This is handover to you.

614
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:53,005
MAN: A.D.F. check.
COOPER: Over.

615
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:57,009
Pull thrusters back.
Fuel cells one, two, three.

616
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:58,511
MAN:
One hundred percent.

617
00:43:58,678 --> 00:44:00,513
COOPER:
Ex-mites.

618
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,315
It's hard leaving everything.

619
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:14,193
My kids. Your father.

620
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:17,196
We're going to be spending
a lot of time together.

621
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:20,408
- We should learn to talk.
- And when not to.

622
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:24,245
Just being honest.

623
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:26,747
I don't think you need to be that honest.

624
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:29,584
Hey, TARS, what's your honesty parameter?

625
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,378
TARS: Ninety percent.
- Ninety percent?

626
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:35,590
Absolute honesty isn't always
the most diplomatic, nor the...

627
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:38,342
...safest form of communication
with emotional beings.

628
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:39,969
Okay.

629
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:43,055
Ninety percent it is, Dr. Brand.

630
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:49,979
We are coming up on the <i>Endurance.</i>

Okay, so...

three-dimensional space into two dimensions...

- Gentle?

1460
01:46:44,273 --> 01:46:47,735
They're hardly gentle.
But the tidal gravity is so quick that...

1461
01:46:47,902 --> 01:46:52,156
...something crossing the horizon fast
might survive. A probe, say.

1462

- What happens after it crosses?
- After the horizon is a complete mystery.

1463
01:46:57,161 --> 01:47:00,247
So, what's to say
there isn't some way that the probe...

1464
01:47:00,414 --> 01:47:03,334
...can glimpse the singularity
and relay the quantum data?

so we wouldn't breathe so much of it.</i>
