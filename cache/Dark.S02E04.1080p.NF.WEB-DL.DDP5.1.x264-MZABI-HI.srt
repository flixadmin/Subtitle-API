[knocking]

170
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:55,130
I'm sorry,
but we have to tell someone.

00:18:56,088 --> 00:18:57,755
[door opens]

172
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,546
- Thanks for getting here so soon.
- [door closes]

173
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:04,213
I know none of this
makes any sense, but...

174
00:19:04,921 --> 00:19:06,796
this is Jonas. He...

175
00:19:07,296 --> 00:19:12,213
He's much older, but he knows
where my Jonas is and where Ulrich is.

176
00:19:21,796 --> 00:19:25,505
[Charlotte] You're the man Regina
was talking about, from the hotel.

177
00:19:28,671 --> 00:19:30,213
Who are these people?

178
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,755
This man here, the priest.

179
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,880
Do you know who he is?

180
00:19:43,588 --> 00:19:45,046
That is Noah.

181
00:19:46,546 --> 00:19:47,713
Are you sure?

182
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:51,796
What do you know about him?

183
00:19:54,921 --> 00:19:57,171
- He's one of them.
- What is this?

184
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,088
[Charlotte] One of whom?

185
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,630
Of Sic Mundus.

186
00:20:04,546 --> 00:20:05,755
The travelers.

187
00:20:06,713 --> 00:20:08,213
The travelers?

188
00:20:09,338 --> 00:20:10,963
<i>Sic mundus creatus est?</i>

189
00:20:12,338 --> 00:20:15,296
What are you talking about?
You knew all this?

190
00:20:15,796 --> 00:20:17,838
The time travel.

191
00:20:18,713 --> 00:20:21,005
There's something
I think you both should see.

192
00:20:21,088 --> 00:20:23,088
[oppressive music]

193
00:20:37,755 --> 00:20:38,755
Okay.

[quiet, suspenseful music]

195
00:20:47,505 --> 00:20:49,421
You want to go in there?

196
00:20:51,255 --> 00:20:55,880
After four children disappeared?

197
00:20:58,713 --> 00:20:59,880
[sighs]

198
00:21:07,255 --> 00:21:10,713
You stay by me.
I'll make sure we're safe. Okay?

WINDEN MUNICIPAL LIBRARY

[clears throat] Excuse me.

201
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,630
I'd like to learn about...

202
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,088
the town's history.

203
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,046
Where can I find articles and documents
of the last 30 years or so?

204
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:57,005
That's all digital now.

205
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:04,255
And where's that?

206
00:23:02,213 --> 00:23:03,546
Excuse me.

207
00:23:04,671 --> 00:23:06,130
Where is the keyboard?

208
00:23:07,546 --> 00:23:08,630
There isn't one.

NUCLEAR POWER PLANT BOSS
DISAPPEARS WITHOUT A TRACE

213
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,546
[Clausen] Did you inform her
about the appointment?

214
00:23:56,213 --> 00:23:57,421
[Wöller] Yes.

216
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:02,505
What do you know about Hannah Kahnwald?

217
00:24:08,171 --> 00:24:10,421
Her husband committed suicide.

218
00:24:11,338 --> 00:24:12,963
Hanged himself.

219
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,796
No one here understood
why she married him.

220
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,505
She was so pretty.
She could've had any man she wanted.

221
00:24:20,588 --> 00:24:24,171
There were rumors that she had an affair
with Ulrich Nielsen.

222
00:24:26,046 --> 00:24:28,213
Did Mrs. Nielsen know about that?

223
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,171
Can I ask you something?

224
00:24:45,838 --> 00:24:47,005
Ask away.

225
00:24:49,255 --> 00:24:51,588
How'd you get this position?

226
00:24:52,838 --> 00:24:54,380
Special task force.

227
00:24:54,796 --> 00:24:56,921
Did you volunteer for this?

228
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,880
Oh, yes.

229
00:25:04,796 --> 00:25:05,796
I did.

230
00:25:14,088 --> 00:25:16,088
[sad piano music]

231
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,796
IS THIS MAN A CHILD MURDERER?

232
00:25:37,338 --> 00:25:39,880
She told me and Tronte what we have to do.

233
00:25:42,838 --> 00:25:44,421
Claudia Tiedemann.

234
00:25:45,005 --> 00:25:46,880
She knew exactly at what time

235
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:48,546
things would happen.

236
00:25:49,255 --> 00:25:53,338
It didn't make any sense, yet it was
the only way anything made sense.

237
00:25:54,463 --> 00:25:56,505
You knew about all of this?

238
00:25:59,046 --> 00:26:02,005
Michael, Mikkel, Ulrich?

239
00:26:04,046 --> 00:26:05,046
About everything?

240
00:26:12,796 --> 00:26:16,255
This here... She gave us this book.

241
00:26:17,005 --> 00:26:21,130
It's all in there, about all the children.
Who disappeared when.

242
00:26:22,088 --> 00:26:23,755
Things about time travel.

243
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:27,421
Symbols and tables
we can't quite understand.

244
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:33,463
- The last few pages were ripped out.
- Does Katharina know this?

245
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,963
Well, you have to tell her.

246
00:26:48,005 --> 00:26:49,213
Okay.

247
00:26:52,546 --> 00:26:54,213
But let me do it.

248
00:26:59,796 --> 00:27:01,338

ON JUNE 26, 1987

255
00:27:57,296 --> 00:27:58,963
Excuse me.

256
00:27:59,421 --> 00:28:01,338
Can I print off these things?

Jonas.

261
00:28:57,296 --> 00:28:58,963
It all feels so real.

262
00:29:00,755 --> 00:29:02,505
As if he was still alive.

263
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:06,755
How could it feel that way
if he's really dead?

264
00:29:09,546 --> 00:29:13,338
It's possible he knew something,
before he disappeared.

265
00:29:14,588 --> 00:29:16,130
What are you saying?

266
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,838
What if he saw something
that he shouldn't have seen?

267
00:29:22,213 --> 00:29:24,505
[Magnus] The door has to be
in this direction.

[blows]

269
00:29:54,213 --> 00:29:56,546
[Katharina] Where are we going, Charlotte?

270
00:30:01,213 --> 00:30:03,088
Tell me where we're going.

271
00:30:05,255 --> 00:30:07,421
Damn it, Charlotte!
Where are you taking me?

272
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:11,005
It's easier to understand
if you just see it.

273
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,880
What have you found?

274
00:30:22,463 --> 00:30:24,171
You found them.

275
00:30:28,463 --> 00:30:30,463
We found them.

276
00:30:30,546 --> 00:30:31,796
Both.

277
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:35,796
And they're not dead. They're still alive.

278
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,338
But they're not here.

279
00:30:45,255 --> 00:30:47,046
They're not here?

280
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:50,546
But they're alive... What does that mean?

281
00:30:51,671 --> 00:30:54,046
It's better if you see it
with your own eyes.

282

Why is she here?

285
00:31:23,963 --> 00:31:25,921
What's all this about, Charlotte?

286
00:31:26,338 --> 00:31:29,921
You said you thought Mikkel
went into the cave. You were right.

287
00:31:30,005 --> 00:31:33,421
Mikkel was in the cave
and Ulrich was looking for him in there.

288
00:31:38,338 --> 00:31:40,463
But they found something in the tunnels.

289
00:31:41,921 --> 00:31:45,380
A kind of tear... in the fabric of time.

290
00:31:56,005 --> 00:31:57,713
You can't be serious.

291
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:05,671
What is all this shit?

292
00:32:07,255 --> 00:32:09,713
- Where are Mikkel and Ulrich?
- [Hannah] It's true.

293
00:32:09,796 --> 00:32:13,505
Stay out of this!
Nobody asked you for your opinion.

294
00:32:16,755 --> 00:32:18,255
Charlotte is right.

295
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:22,755
Uh-huh. Another one?

296
00:32:25,505 --> 00:32:28,171
And who are you? Her new boy toy?

297
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:31,421
I'm Jonas.

298
00:32:33,921 --> 00:32:35,380
Her son.

299
00:32:39,213 --> 00:32:40,213
And your grandson.

- We're not alone.

306
00:33:54,963 --> 00:33:56,088
Go. Go, go!

[Martha] Why are you here?

314
00:34:42,671 --> 00:34:46,838
[Katharina] My husband is trapped
in the '50s, and my son in the '80s.

315
00:34:48,005 --> 00:34:51,630
You chose to leave him there
because Mikkel is your father. That right?

316
00:34:52,838 --> 00:34:54,213
Yes.

317
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:05,963
I can't take this seriously.
You're buying into all this bullshit?

318
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:09,838
What's in it for you? Huh?

319
00:35:12,546 --> 00:35:16,713
Do you want money?
Can you speak with the dead? Yeah?

Katharina.

321
00:35:23,546 --> 00:35:24,963
I was there.

322
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,546
I saw him there.

323
00:35:29,088 --> 00:35:30,213
Mikkel.
