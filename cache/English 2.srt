Now that we've got that
out of the way, team,

785
00:41:52,666 --> 00:41:53,833
I've been trying to tell you,

786
00:41:53,833 --> 00:41:55,916
I think I know how she's
making the weird jump points.

787
00:41:57,083 --> 00:41:58,083
She has one of these.

788
00:41:58,958 --> 00:42:00,458
It's my <i>nani's</i> bangle.

789
00:42:00,833 --> 00:42:03,083
It started glowing really weirdly

790
00:42:03,083 --> 00:42:05,708
when Dar-Benn opened
that first jump point. Also,

791
00:42:05,708 --> 00:42:08,791
it once traveled me
through space and time,

792
00:42:08,791 --> 00:42:10,583
so that's probably related.

793
00:42:11,833 --> 00:42:13,375
What you're describing
is a Quantum Band.

794
00:42:13,875 --> 00:42:15,166
I mean, I knew
there were two of these.

795
00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:17,250
I just did not expect
the other one to be in space.

796
00:42:18,041 --> 00:42:20,625
They're a pair? How do
you have a Quantum Band?

797
00:42:20,625 --> 00:42:22,166
Okay. What is a Quantum Band?

798
00:42:22,166 --> 00:42:24,541
A myth. Or I thought it was a myth.

799
00:42:24,541 --> 00:42:26,333
It's an ancient artifact.

(INTRIGUING MUSIC PLAYING)

801
00:42:27,708 --> 00:42:30,083
So this is what
Dar-Benn found on MB-418.

802
00:42:30,083 --> 00:42:31,166
And then her and Kamala

803
00:42:31,166 --> 00:42:32,833
just happened to stumble into each other?

804
00:42:32,833 --> 00:42:34,708
I mean, what are the chances?

"What you seek is seeking you."

806
00:42:37,375 --> 00:42:39,166
It's inscribed on the bangle.

807
00:42:39,166 --> 00:42:41,208
If the Kree legends are true,

808
00:42:41,208 --> 00:42:43,041
the Quantum Bands
were used to create

809
00:42:43,041 --> 00:42:45,208
every jump point in the universe.

Two Quantum Bands working
in unison to connect the galaxy.

812
00:42:50,666 --> 00:42:52,041
So that would explain

our switch-y entanglement situation.

814
00:42:54,208 --> 00:42:57,250
Yeah, yeah, but Dar-Benn only has one.

815
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:59,916

with the energy

MONICA: Here is what we do know.

893
00:46:19,416 --> 00:46:21,541
The Universal Neural
Teleportation Network

894
00:46:21,541 --> 00:46:22,916
is a system of wormholes

895
00:46:22,916 --> 00:46:24,041
through the space-time continuum

896
00:46:24,041 --> 00:46:25,333
aka, jump points,

897
00:46:25,333 --> 00:46:28,125
which allows us to hop between
different planetary systems.

898
00:46:28,125 --> 00:46:30,583
Basically, it stretches
and reconfigures space

899
00:46:30,583 --> 00:46:31,958
without rupturing the continuum.

900
00:46:32,541 --> 00:46:35,166
Like fracking, the more holes you drill,

901
00:46:35,166 --> 00:46:37,458
the more destabilized
the shale becomes,

902
00:46:37,458 --> 00:46:38,916
and then... earthquake.

903
00:46:41,125 --> 00:46:43,416
Bottom line, if she keeps
creating these jump points,

904
00:46:43,416 --> 00:46:45,500
it's gonna get really bad, really fast.

905
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,958
Question is, what does she want?

906
00:46:48,916 --> 00:46:51,333
Tarnax used to be occupied by the Kree,

907
00:46:51,333 --> 00:46:53,583
so maybe the attack was a warning?

908
00:46:53,583 --> 00:46:55,833
So, she could be after
another former colony?

909
00:46:55,833 --> 00:46:57,500
Is there a former Kree colony
in the Magellanic?

910
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,208
CAROL: At one point, the Kree colonized

911
00:46:59,208 --> 00:47:01,791
25% of the galaxy, so...

912
00:47:01,791 --> 00:47:03,875
If all she wanted was to destroy Tarnax,

913
00:47:03,875 --> 00:47:06,500
why not bring in an army
or use a bomb or something?

914
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:07,625
Why a jump point?

915
00:47:07,625 --> 00:47:09,458
You're right.
Jump points aren't weapons,

916
00:47:09,458 --> 00:47:10,791
they're means of transportation.

917
00:47:10,791 --> 00:47:12,625
Every jump point has two sides,

918
00:47:12,625 --> 00:47:15,083
so if Tarnax's atmosphere
was siphoned away,

919
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,916
- it had to go somewhere, or...
- Hala.

920
00:47:20,041 --> 00:47:21,041
The Kree Civil War

921
00:47:21,041 --> 00:47:23,666
basically bankrupted Hala
of its natural resources.

922
00:47:23,666 --> 00:47:24,833

923
