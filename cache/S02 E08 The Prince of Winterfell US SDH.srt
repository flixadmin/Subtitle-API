2
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,575
( creaks )

3
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,876
- Man:<i> RIDER APPROACHING!</i>
<i>- Man #2: OPEN THE GATE!</i>

4
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,795
( creaking )

5

<i>( horses neighing )</i>

6
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:38,366
- WHY, IT'S THE PRINCE
OF WINTERFELL.
- ( men laugh )

7
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:41,786
- ENVY ISN'T ATTRACTIVE.
- WHAT ENVY?

8
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,414
YOU SHOULD BE PROUD
OF YOUR BROTHER'S
ACHIEVEMENT.

9
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:47,542
I TOOK THE GREAT CASTLE
OF WINTERFELL WITH 20 MEN.

10
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,002
YOU'RE A GREAT WARRIOR.

11
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:51,421
I SAW THE BODIES
ABOVE YOUR GATES.

12
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,381
WHICH ONE GAVE YOU
THE TOUGHER FIGHT,

13
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:55,008
THE CRIPPLE OR
THE SIX-YEAR-OLD?

14
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:57,343
( men laugh )

15
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,470
I TREATED THE STARK
BOYS WITH HONOR

16
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,598
AND THEY REPAID ME
WITH TREACHERY.

17
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,642
YOU TREATED THEM WITH HONOR
BY BUTCHERING THEM?

18
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,769
BEFORE I HAD TO KILL THEM,
I TREATED THEM--

19
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,022
YOU SEIZED THEIR HOME,
AS IS YOUR RIGHT.

20
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:11,733
- WE'RE IRONBORN;
WE TAKE WHAT WE NEED.
- EXACTLY.

21
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:14,736
THEN YOU MADE THEM
PRISONERS IN THEIR HOME
AND THEY RAN AWAY.

22
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,238
IS THAT TREACHERY?

23
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,365
I'D CALL IT BRAVERY.

24
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,700
THEY MADE ME A PROMISE--

25
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:22,702
YOUR LITTLE BOY PRISONERS
MADE YOU A PROMISE

26
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:25,288
AND YOU GOT MAD
WHEN THEY BROKE IT?

27
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:26,956
ARE YOU THE DUMBEST
CUNT ALIVE?

28
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,875
- DON'T CALL ME A--
- A CUNT.

29
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:33,254
A DUMB CUNT WHO KILLED
THE ONLY TWO STARKS
IN WINTERFELL.

30
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,506
YOU KNOW HOW VALUABLE
THOSE BOYS WERE?

31
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,217
IF I HADN'T KILLED THEM,
THE NORTHERNERS WOULD
THINK ME WEAK.

32
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:41,262
YOU ARE WEAK.
AND YOU'RE STUPID.

33
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,806
I'M WARNING YOU.

34
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,516
GO ON, THEN,

35
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,435
WARN ME.

36
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:52,941
YOU HAVEN'T BROUGHT
ENOUGH MEN.

37
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:55,234
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO DEFEND WINTERFELL
WITH JUST THIS LOT?

38
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:58,363
YOU'RE NOT.
I'VE COME TO BRING
YOU HOME.

39
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:00,823
- FATHER WANTS A WORD.
- IS THIS A JOKE?

40
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,700
WINTERFELL IS THE HEART
OF THE NORTH.

41
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:06,496
AYE, IT IS,
HUNDREDS OF MILES
FROM THE SEA.

42
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,331
WE'RE ISLANDERS,
BABY BROTHER.

43
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:09,707
<i>HAD YOU FORGOTTEN THAT?</i>

44
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,585
<i>OUR POWER COMES</i>
<i>FROM OUR SHIPS.</i>

45
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,504
<i>AND NOW THAT YOU'VE</i>
<i>DECORATED YOUR WALLS</i>

46
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,422
<i>WITH THE BODIES</i>
<i>OF THE STARK BOYS,</i>

47
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:20,343
EVERY MAN IN THE NORTH
WANTS TO SEE YOU HANGED.

48
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,762
WHEN ROBB STARK
FINDS OUT--

49
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:24,514
HE WON'T FIND OUT.
WE'VE KILLED ALL THE RAVENS.

50
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,558
WE HAVE ALL THE HORSES.

51
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:30,520
I'VE TAKEN WINTERFELL.

52
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:34,440
AND I WILL KEEP WINTERFELL.

53
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,194
LEAVE US.

54
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,459
THEON, YOU'RE MY BLOOD.

55
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:57,380
WE BOTH LOVED OUR MOTHER.

56
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:00,550
WE BOTH ENDURED
OUR FATHER.

57
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,345
COME HOME WITH ME.
DON'T DIE HERE ALONE.

58
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,556
I DON'T INTEND TO DIE.

59
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:14,480
YOU WERE A TERRIBLE BABY,
DO YOU KNOW THAT?

60
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,693
BAWLING ALL THE TIME,
NEVER SLEEPING.

61
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,739
AND ONE NIGHT YOU JUST
WOULDN'T SHUT UP,

62
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:26,534
SCREAMING LIKE A DYING PIG.

63
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:30,288
I WALKED OVER TO YOUR CRIB,
I LOOKED DOWN AT YOU.

64
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:33,541
I WANTED TO STRANGLE YOU.

65
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:36,753
AND YOU LOOKED UP AT ME
AND YOU STOPPED SCREAMING.

66
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:40,590
YOU SMILED AT ME.

67
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:47,138
DON'T DIE
SO FAR FROM THE SEA.

68
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:05,948
I'VE BROUGHT YOU
A PRESENT, LORD OF BONES.

69
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:09,243
I ALREADY GOT ONE CROW.
DON'T NEED TWO.

70
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,454
MANCE WILL WANT
TO QUESTION THIS ONE.

71
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:14,332
<i>KNOWS ALL ABOUT</i>
<i>WHERE THE CROWS ARE</i>
<i>AND WHAT THEY'RE PLANNING.</i>

72
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:17,960
THE HALFHAND KNOWS MORE.
THIS ONE IS JUST A LITTLE BOY.

73
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,378
GUT HIM.

74
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:22,006
HE COULD HAVE KILLED ME
HALF A DOZEN TIMES.

75
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,884
AND NOW HE WISHES HE DID.
GUT HIM.

76
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:29,097
HE'S A BASTARD
OF WINTERFELL,
NED STARK'S SON.

77
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,477
MANCE WILL WANT HIM.

78
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,480
WHAT DOES MANCE WANT
WITH A DEAD MAN'S BASTARD?

79
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,315
I DON'T KNOW.

80
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:42,193
I THINK HE'LL WANT
TO DECIDE FOR HIMSELF.

81
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:51,828
HE RUNS, I'LL CHOP
HIS BALLS OFF.

82
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,622
HE RUNS,
I'LL DO IT MESELF.

83
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,257
WE'RE EVEN NOW,
JON SNOW.

84
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:19,897
I COULDN'T DO IT.

85
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,816
I HAD THE SWORD
AT HER NECK,
I JUST COULDN'T--

86
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:24,986
- I KNOW.
- THE OTHERS?

87
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:28,030
WHEN YOU DIDN'T COME BACK,
WE WENT LOOKING FOR YOU.

88
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,491
WE FOUND YOUR TRACKS
FAST ENOUGH.

89
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:33,703
BUT THEY FOUND US
BEFORE WE FOUND YOU.

90
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,539
THEY DIED BECAUSE OF ME.

91
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:39,667
SEE THAT IT WASN'T
FOR NOTHING.

92
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,252
ALL RIGHT, UP, LAD.

93
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:43,171
COME ON,
ON YOUR FEET, NOW.

94
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:46,048
MOVE IT.

95
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,176
<i>( birds calling,</i>
<i>water burbling )</i>

96
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:53,598
IS SHE BEAUTIFUL?

97
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,600
I'VE NEVER MET HER.

98
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,518
WHAT'S HER NAME?

99
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,187
FREY, I SUPPOSE.

100
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,856
I DON'T KNOW
HER FIRST NAME.

101
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:04,358
I'M SURE YOU'LL
BE VERY HAPPY.

102
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,737
( both laugh )

103
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,655
AND YOU'RE MARRYING
HER FOR A BRIDGE?

104
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,950
- AN IMPORTANT BRIDGE.
- AH.

105
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,077
IT WAS BEFORE
THEY KILLED MY FATHER.

106
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:19,290
I STILL THOUGHT I COULD
MARCH SOUTH AND RESCUE
HIM IN TIME,

107
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:21,626
BUT ONLY IF I CROSSED
THAT BRIDGE.

108
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,922
WHEN I SPEAK TO PEOPLE
FROM THE NORTH,

109
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,466
THEY ALL LOVED
YOUR FATHER.

110
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:32,261
HE WAS THE BEST MAN
I EVER MET.

111
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,056
I KNOW CHILDREN
ALWAYS THINK THAT ABOUT
THEIR FATHERS, BUT--

112
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:37,934
CHILDREN DO NOT
ALWAYS THINK THAT
ABOUT THEIR FATHERS,

113
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,478
BELIEVE ME.

114
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:43,773
HE ONCE TOLD ME
THAT BEING A LORD
IS LIKE BEING A FATHER,

115
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:46,025
EXCEPT YOU HAVE
THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN

116
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,319
AND YOU WORRY ABOUT
ALL OF THEM.

117
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:51,280
THE FARMERS PLOWING
THE FIELDS ARE YOURS
TO PROTECT.

118
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,825
THE CHARWOMEN
SCRUBBING THE FLOORS,
YOURS TO PROTECT.

119
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:58,538
THE SOLDIERS
YOU ORDER INTO BATTLE.

120
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,831
HE TOLD ME HE WOKE
WITH FEAR IN THE MORNING

121
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,292
AND WENT TO BED
WITH FEAR IN THE NIGHT.

122
00:09:05,544 --> 00:09:08,422
I DIDN'T BELIEVE HIM.

123
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,549
I ASKED HIM,

124
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,803
"HOW CAN A MAN BE BRAVE
IF HE'S AFRAID?"

125
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:17,598
"THAT IS THE ONLY TIME
A MAN CAN BE BRAVE,"
HE TOLD ME.

126
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:23,729
I WISH I COULD HAVE
MET HIM.

127
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,190
HE WOULD HAVE
LIKED YOU.

128
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:30,444
MOST LORDS WORRY MORE
ABOUT THEIR GOLD

129
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,655
AND THEIR GLORY
THAN THE CHARWOMEN
SCRUBBING THEIR FLOORS.

130
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:36,575
- HE DIDN'T CARE MUCH
ABOUT GOLD OR GLORY.
- AND YOU?

131
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:39,745
YOU THINK I'M FIGHTING
THIS WAR SO THEY'LL SING
SONGS ABOUT ME?

132
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,416
I WANT TO GO HOME.

133
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:46,085
I WANT THE MEN
FOLLOWING ME TO GO HOME.

134
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:48,004
THEN WHY DON'T YOU?

135
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:51,340
BECAUSE WE'LL NEVER BE
SAFE UNTIL THE LANNISTERS
ARE DEFEATED.

136
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,592
AND BECAUSE I BELIEVE
IN JUSTICE.

137
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,803
CHOPPING OFF
JOFFREY'S HEAD, YOU MEAN.

138
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,305
THAT WOULD BE A START.

139
00:09:57,388 --> 00:10:00,057
<i>( horse neighs,</i>
<i>hoofbeats approaching )</i>

140
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,025
YOUR GRACE, MILADY.

141
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:12,028
THE KINGSLAYER,
HE ESCAPED IN THE NIGHT.

142
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,446
HOW?

143
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,950
HOW?!

144
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,914
TELL ME THIS ISN'T TRUE.

145
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,130
WHY?

146
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:33,716
- FOR THE GIRLS.
- YOU BETRAYED ME.

147
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,551
- ROBB--
- NO!

148
00:10:35,634 --> 00:10:37,219
YOU KNEW I WOULD
NOT ALLOW IT

149
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,597
AND YOU DID IT
ANYWAY.

150
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,476
BRAN AND RICKON
ARE CAPTIVES IN WINTERFELL.

151
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:46,854
SANSA AND ARYA ARE CAPTIVES
IN KING'S LANDING.

152
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:49,649
I HAVE FIVE CHILDREN,
AND ONLY ONE OF THEM
IS FREE.

153
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:53,402
I LOST ONE SON FIGHTING
BY YOUR SON'S SIDE.

154
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,237
I LOST ANOTHER
TO THE KINGSLAYER,

155
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,365
STRANGLED WITH A CHAIN.

156
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,575
YOU COMMIT TREASON

157
00:10:59,658 --> 00:11:02,161
<i>BECAUSE YOUR CHILDREN</i>
<i>ARE PRISONERS?</i>

158
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:04,872
<i>I WOULD CARVE OUT</i>
<i>MY HEART</i>

159
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:07,750
AND OFFER IT TO THE FATHER
IF HE WOULD LET MY SONS

160
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:11,045
WAKE FROM THEIR GRAVES
AND STEP INTO A PRISON CELL.

161
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,671
I GRIEVE FOR
YOUR SONS, MY LORD.

162
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,299
I DON'T WANT YOUR GRIEF.
I WANT MY VENGEANCE.

163
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:18,219
AND YOU STOLE IT
FROM ME.

164
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:20,930
KILLING JAIME LANNISTER

165
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,182
WOULD NOT BUY LIFE
FOR YOUR CHILDREN,

166
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:25,101
BUT RETURNING HIM
TO KING'S LANDING

167
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,895
MAY BUY LIFE
FOR MINE.

168
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:31,399
JAIME LANNISTER HAS PLAYED
YOU FOR A FOOL.

169
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,692
YOU'VE WEAKENED
OUR POSITION.

170
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,529
YOU'VE BROUGHT DISCORD
INTO OUR CAMP.

171
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:39,073
AND YOU DID IT ALL
BEHIND MY BACK.

172
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:44,286
MAKE SURE SHE'S GUARDED
DAY AND NIGHT.

173
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,248
- ROBB.
- HOW MANY MEN DID WE SEND
IN PURSUIT OF THE KINGSLAYER?

174
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:48,707
40, YOUR GRACE.

175
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,961
SEND ANOTHER 40
WITH OUR FASTEST HORSES.

176
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,629
ROBB.

177
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,098
( neighing )

178
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,144
WHOA, OOF!

179
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:11,063
( groans )

180
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,940
DAMN.

181
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:18,279
YOU'RE MUCH UGLIER
IN DAYLIGHT.

182
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:20,489
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

183
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,617
I'M JAIME LANNISTER
OF CASTERLY ROCK,

184
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,620
SON OF TYWIN.

185
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:30,374
A CAPTIVE KNIGHT HAS A RIGHT
TO KNOW HIS CAPTOR'S IDENTITY.

186
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,168
BRIENNE OF TARTH.

187
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,669
TARTH, TARTH, TARTH.

188
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:37,006
CRESCENT MOONS
AND STARBURSTS.

189
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,801
LORD... SELWYN TARTH,

190
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,220
YOUR FATHER.

191
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:46,515
DO YOU HAVE ANY BROTHERS
AND SISTERS, MY LADY?

192
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,143
IT'S A LONG WAY
TO KING'S LANDING.

193
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:51,312
MIGHT AS WELL GET
TO KNOW ONE ANOTHER.

194
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,106
HAVE YOU KNOWN MANY MEN?

195
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,483
I SUPPOSE NOT.

196
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,234
WOMEN?

197
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,570
HORSES?
AH!

198
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,697
I DIDN'T MEAN TO GIVE
OFFENSE, MY LADY.

199
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:05,326
- FORGIVE ME.
- YOUR CRIMES ARE PAST
FORGIVENESS, KINGSLAYER.

200
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:06,952
WHY DO YOU
HATE ME SO MUCH?

201
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,580
-<i> HAVE I EVER HARMED YOU?</i>
<i>- YOU'VE HARMED OTHERS--</i>

202
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:12,082
<i>THOSE YOU WERE</i>
<i>SWORN TO PROTECT,</i>

203
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,043
THE WEAK,
THE INNOCENT.

204
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:17,379
HAS ANYONE EVER TOLD
YOU YOU'RE AS BORING
AS YOU ARE UGLY?

205
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,840
YOU WILL NOT
PROVOKE ME TO ANGER.

206
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,510
I ALREADY HAVE.
LOOK AT YOU.

207
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,261
YOU'RE READY
TO CHOP MY HEAD OFF.

208
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,972
DO YOU THINK
YOU COULD?

209
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,058
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD
BEAT ME IN A FAIR FIGHT?

210
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,768
I'VE NEVER
SEEN YOU FIGHT.

211
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,853
THE ANSWER IS NO.

212
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:36,440
THERE ARE THREE MEN
IN THE KINGDOMS WHO MIGHT
HAVE A CHANCE AGAINST ME.

213
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:37,775
YOU'RE NOT ONE OF THEM.

214
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:41,070
ALL MY LIFE MEN LIKE YOU
HAVE SNEERED AT ME.

215
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:44,281
AND ALL MY LIFE I'VE BEEN
KNOCKING MEN LIKE YOU
INTO THE DUST.

216
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,742
IF YOU'RE SO CONFIDENT,
UNLOCK MY CHAINS.

217
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:48,577
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

218
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,705
DO YOU TAKE ME
FOR AN IDIOT? IN.

219
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,669
I TOOK YOU
FOR A FIGHTER,

220
00:13:56,752 --> 00:14:00,673
A MAN-- PARDON--
WOMAN OF HONOR.

221
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:03,133
WAS I WRONG?

222
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,969
YOU'RE AFRAID.

223
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:10,015
MAYBE ONE DAY
WE'LL FIND OUT,
KINGSLAYER.

224
00:14:22,861 --> 00:14:24,947
Kevan:
<i>KING'S LANDING</i>
<i>WILL FALL AN HOUR</i>

225
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:28,075
<i>AFTER STANNIS</i>
<i>LANDS HIS FORCE.</i>

226
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:30,494
<i>IT'S NOT TOO LATE FOR</i>
<i>KING JOFFREY AND CERSEI</i>

227
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:33,789
<i>AND THE COURT</i>
<i>TO RIDE WEST TO SAFETY.</i>

228
00:14:33,872 --> 00:14:35,874
SURRENDER THE IRON THRONE?

229
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:39,003
BETTER THAN SEEING THEIR HEADS
MOUNTED ON THE CITY GATES.

230
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:41,463
STANNIS WILL
EXECUTE THEM ALL.

231
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,675
NO, A KING WHO RUNS
WILL NOT BE KING FOR LONG.

232
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:47,720
HE'S A LANNISTER.
HE'LL STAND AND FIGHT.

233
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,432
STANNIS, TWO DAYS
FROM THE CAPITAL

234
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,267
AND THE WOLF
AT MY DOORSTEP.

235
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:56,145
THE SCOUTS ASSURE US
ROBB STARK REMAINS
NORTH OF ASHEMARK.

236
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:59,273
HA! THE LAST TIME
THE SCOUTS ASSURED US

237
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:02,026
OF STARK'S MOVEMENT,
HE LURED US INTO A TRAP.

238
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:06,363
<i>WHICH IS WHY MY SON</i>
<i>IS HIS PRISONER.</i>

239
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,453
<i>TOO CLOSE</i>
<i>TO CASTERLY ROCK.</i>

240
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,873
HE SENT A SPLINTER FORCE

241
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,541
TO RECAPTURE WINTERFELL.

242
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,627
THE GREYJOYS HAVE
DONE US A GREAT FAVOR.

243
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:23,005
STARK WON'T RISK MARCHING
ON CASTERLY ROCK

244
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,423
UNTIL HE'S AT FULL FORCE.

245
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:28,385
HE'S A BOY AND HE'S
NEVER LOST A BATTLE.

246
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,721
HE'LL RISK ANYTHING
AT ANY TIME

247
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:34,350
<i>BECAUSE HE DOESN'T KNOW</i>
<i>ENOUGH TO BE AFRAID.</i>

248
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:44,026
WE'LL RIDE AT NIGHTFALL.

249
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:47,112
<i>I WANT A FULL NIGHT'S</i>
<i>MARCH BEFORE HE KNOWS</i>
<i>WE'RE ON THE MOVE.</i>

250
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:50,866
CLEGANE, YOU'LL MAINTAIN
A GARRISON HERE AT HARRENHAL.

251
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:54,328
TRACK DOWN THIS BROTHERHOOD
AND DESTROY THEM.

252
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:59,333
THE GIRL HAS PROVEN
HERSELF A GOOD SERVANT.

253
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,710
<i>SHE'LL STAY ON WITH YOU.</i>

254
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,962
<i>SEE THAT HE DOESN'T GET</i>
<i>DRUNK IN THE EVENINGS.</i>

255
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,715
HE'S POOR COMPANY
WHEN HE'S SOBER,

256
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,593
BUT HE'S BETTER
AT HIS WORK.

257
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,852
YOU'VE GOT SOME
QUESTIONS TO ANSWER.

258
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,854
Man:
<i>WHO KILLED SER AMORY?</i>

259
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,065
- Man #2: I DON'T KNOW!
-<i> GIVE ME THE NAME.</i>

260
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,900
- Man #2: PLEASE!
- Man #3:<i> TAKE THIS ONE</i>
<i>OUT FOR THE CROWS.</i>

261
00:16:24,983 --> 00:16:28,278
Man #2:
<i>I TOLD YOU, I DON'T KNOW.</i>

262
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,406
<i>PLEASE.</i>

263
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:33,325
LOOK, IT'S YOREN'S
LITTLE CUNT.

264
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,035
USED TO BE A BOY,
NOW IT'S A GIRL.

265
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:38,080
- ( man laughs )
- WHERE'S JAQEN?

266
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,540
DON'T CARE.

267
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:42,710
WHERE'S YOUR STICK
NOW, BITCH?

268
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,420
I PROMISED
TO FUCK YOU WITH IT.

269
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,256
Guard:
<i>COME ON, TIME TO KILL</i>
<i>SOME WOLVES.</i>

270
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,676
<i>( men shouting )</i>

271
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,392
YOU NEED SOUR CHERRIES
TO MAKE IT RIGHT.

272
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:01,729
<i>AND THE SECRET IS YOU DRY</i>
<i>THE STONES, AND THEN YOU</i>
<i>BREAK THEM WITH A MALLET.</i>

273
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,522
<i>THAT'S WHERE</i>
<i>THE REAL FLAVOR IS.</i>

274
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,524
<i>YOU CRUSH 'EM UP REAL FINE.</i>

275
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:07,609
AND THEN WHEN YOU'RE
FINISHED, YOU SPRINKLE
THEM OVER THE PIECRUST.

276
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,278
- WHERE'S JAQEN?
- HOW WOULD I KNOW?

277
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,280
I NEED HIM NOW.

278
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,906
LORD TYWIN'S
MARCHING TONIGHT.

279
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,617
- YOU NEED HIM?
- HE'S HELPING ME.

280
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,203
- Hot Pie: I SAW HIM.
- WHERE?

281
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,875
- WHERE?!
- OW!

282
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,043
- WHERE?
- THEY WENT RIDING OUT
THE GATES A FEW HOURS AGO.

283
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:29,173
ON PATROL.
LET GO OF MY EARS.

284
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,841
<i>( horses neighing,</i>
<i>men shouting )</i>

285
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,471
WHAT DO YOU WANT
WITH HIM ANYWAY?

286
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,806
<i>( men shouting )</i>

287
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,193
( wind howling )

288
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:53,238
Qhorin:
MANCE IS GONNA
MARCH ON THE WALL.

289
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,741
WHEN HE DOES, ONE BROTHER
INSIDE HIS ARMY

290
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:57,534
WILL BE WORTH 1,000
FIGHTING AGAINST IT.

291
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,787
- THEY'LL NEVER TRUST ME.
- THEY MIGHT...

292
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,747
- IF YOU DO WHAT
NEEDS TO BE DONE.
- WHAT?

293
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,166
HOW DOES IT FEEL KNOWING
THOSE MEN ALL DIED

294
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:07,336
SO YOU COULD SKIP
THROUGH THE SNOW WITH
YOUR LITTLE SAVAGE GIRL?

295
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:11,924
- I DIDN'T.
- I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER,
TRUSTING A TRAITOR'S BASTARD.

296
00:18:15,093 --> 00:18:18,680
HE'S NOT YOURS
TO KILL, CROW.

297
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,871
DO YOU HAVE
TO DO THAT HERE?

298
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:47,501
I LIKE TO KEEP
ME HANDS CLEAN.

299
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:50,003
YES, BUT DO YOU
HAVE TO DO IT HERE?

300
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,764
YOU SHOULD START WEARING
THE GOLD CLOAK.

301
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,683
I DON'T WANT TO WEAR
A GOLD CLOAK.

302
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:05,060
<i>YOU'RE COMMANDER</i>
<i>OF THE CITY WATCH.</i>

303
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,603
YOU SHOULDN'T BE DRESSED
LIKE A COMMON SELLSWORD.

304
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,313
A CLOAK SLOWS YOU DOWN
IN A FIGHT,

305
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,399
MAKES IT HARD
TO MOVE QUIETLY.

306
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:11,900
AND THE GOLD
CATCHES THE LIGHT,

307
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,069
SO YOU'RE NICE AND EASY
TO SPOT AT NIGHT.

308
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:17,030
WELL, YOU'RE NOT SNEAKING
THROUGH ALLEYWAYS ANY LONGER.

309
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,074
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO STAND OUT.

310
00:19:19,157 --> 00:19:22,202
WE HAD A DEAL,
AND WEARING A GOLD CLOAK
WASN'T PART OF IT.

311
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,954
FINE, FINE.

312
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:27,624
NO GOLD CLOAK.

313
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:37,092
- WHAT?
- WHAT?

314
00:19:37,175 --> 00:19:39,386
WHAT? WHAT?
WHY ARE YOU STARING AT ME?

315
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:42,556
( scoffs )
YOU DON'T WANT ME
CLEANING ME NAILS.

316
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:43,932
YOU DON'T WANT ME
LOOKING YOUR WAY.

317
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,767
WHY AM I HERE?

318
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:49,563
- TO HELP ME PLAN THE DEFENSE
OF KING'S LANDING.
- ( laughs )

319
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,148
STANNIS WILL BE HERE
ANY DAY.

320
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:54,443
( sighs )

321
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,154
AND ONE OF THESE
EXPLAINS HOW TO BEAT HIM?

322
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,700
"AN HISTORY OF THE GREAT
SIEGES OF WESTEROS"

323
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:04,536
BY ARCHMAESTER
"SHEVELATHIN."

324
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,538
"SHEVELATESH."

325
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,874
"CHEVALTEESH."

326
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:13,921
I'D SWAP ALL YOUR BOOKS
FOR A FEW GOOD ARCHERS.

327
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:16,214
MY LORD HAND,
COMMANDER.

328
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,799
I MUST COMPLIMENT YOU

329
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:21,011
ON THE GOLD CLOAKS' PERFORMANCE
THESE LAST FEW WEEKS.

330
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:25,098
DID YOU KNOW THERE HAS BEEN
A MARKED DROP IN THIEVERY?

331
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:29,061
I DID NOT KNOW.

332
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:32,481
AND HOW DID YOU ACCOMPLISH
THIS MARKED DROP IN THIEVERY?

333
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,983
ME AND THE LADS ROUNDED UP
ALL THE KNOWN THIEVES.

334
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,527
FOR QUESTIONING?

335
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:40,113
<i>UH, NO.</i>

336
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,574
IT'S JUST THE UNKNOWN THIEVES
WE NEED TO WORRY ABOUT NOW.

337
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,702
- WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.
- AYE, WE TALKED ABOUT IT.

338
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,747
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
IN A CITY UNDER SIEGE?

339
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,999
MAYBE THIS PART'S
NOT IN YOUR BOOKS.

340
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,627
SEE, IT'S NOT THE FIGHTING
THAT KILLS MOST PEOPLE.

341
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,838
IT'S THE STARVING.
FOOD'S WORTH MORE THAN GOLD.

342
00:20:56,922 --> 00:21:00,342
NOBLE LADIES
SELL THEIR DIAMONDS
FOR A SACK OF POTATOES.

343
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,427
THINGS GET BAD ENOUGH,

344
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,304
THE POOR START
EATING EACH OTHER.

345
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:07,099
<i>THE THIEVES,</i>
<i>THEY LOVE A SIEGE.</i>

346
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:10,269
SOON AS THE GATES ARE SEALED,
THEY STEAL ALL THE FOOD.

347
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:13,397
BY THE TIME IT'S ALL OVER,
THEY'RE THE RICHEST MEN IN TOWN.

348
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,233
GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES,
MY LORD,

349
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:19,861
I BELIEVE EXTREME MEASURES
ARE WARRANTED.

350
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,822
AH.

351
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:24,950
"THE GREAT SIEGES
OF WESTEROS."

352
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,868
THRILLING SUBJECT.

353
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:31,665
SHAME ARCHMAESTER CH'VYALTHAN
WASN'T A BETTER WRITER.

354
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:39,214
STANNIS KNOWS
KING'S LANDING.

355
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,800
HE KNOWS WHERE THE WALLS
ARE STRONGEST

356
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:45,721
AND HE KNOWS WHICH GATES
ARE WEAKEST.

357
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,808
THE MUD GATE.

358
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,769
A GOOD RAM WILL BATTER IT
DOWN IN MINUTES

359
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,564
<i>AND IT'S ONLY 50 YARDS</i>
<i>FROM THE WATER.</i>

360
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,190
THAT'S WHERE HE'LL LAND.

361
00:21:57,274 --> 00:22:00,193
AND IF STANNIS DOES
ATTACK THE MUD GATE,

362
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,571
WHAT IS OUR PLAN?

363
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,614
WE COULD THROW
BOOKS AT HIS MEN.

364
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:06,033
WE DON'T HAVE
THAT MANY BOOKS.

365
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:07,868
WE DON'T HAVE
THAT MANY MEN, EITHER.

366
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,829
WHAT DO WE HAVE?

367
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:14,207
PIG SHIT.

368
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:18,003
( wind howling )

369
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:20,172
( chatter )

370
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:29,848
( panting )

371
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,644
I'M NOT CUT OUT
FOR THIS SORT OF WORK.

372
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:38,273
I ALWAYS IMAGINED MESELF
DOING SOMETHING MUCH WORSE.

373
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:40,859
WE'RE DIGGING LATRINE PITS
AT THE END OF THE WORLD.

374
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:43,695
I CAN'T IMAGINE
ANYTHING MUCH WORSE.

375
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:48,158
Dolorous Edd:
<i>YOU LACK IMAGINATION.</i>

376
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:50,410
Sam:
<i>WHERE DO YOU THINK</i>
<i>JON IS RIGHT NOW?</i>

377
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:53,455
HE WENT OFF
WITH THE HALFHAND.
HE DIDN'T COME BACK.

378
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,749
A BETTING MAN
WOULD GO WITH DEAD.

379
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:58,752
HE'S NOT DEAD.

380
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:00,754
NO, JON'S A GREAT
FIGHTER.

381
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:02,798
WELL, HE'S BETTER
THAN ME

382
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,800
AND A LOT BETTER
THAN YOU.

383
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:07,803
HE'S GOT A VALYRIAN
STEEL SWORD.

384
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,805
SO DID HIS FATHER.

385
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:12,599
AND QHORIN HALFHAND
IS THE GREATEST RANGER ALIVE.

386
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:15,394
GREAT RANGERS NEVER
GET OLD IS THE PROBLEM.

387
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,979
SHIT ONES NEITHER.

388
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,941
IT'S THEM IN THE MIDDLE
THAT LAST A LONG TIME.

389
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,946
( clangs )

390
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:28,532
WHAT IN SEVEN HELLS
IS THAT?

391
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:46,133
THE FIRST MEN
MADE THESE MARKS.

392
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:48,844
HELP ME WITH IT.

393
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:54,724
( straining )

394
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,150
LOOK.

395
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,281
IF YOU FIND SOMETHING
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO,

396
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:12,200
BEST THING TO DO IS PRETEND
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN IT.

397
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,952
THAT'S A NIGHT'S
WATCH CLOAK.

398
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:16,538
IT'S BEEN HERE
A LONG TIME.

399
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:24,838
OH, MUST BE DRAGONGLASS.

400
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:26,882
Grenn:
<i>DRAGONGLASS?</i>

401
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:29,676
THE MAESTERS
CALL IT OBSIDIAN.

402
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,804
WHY WOULD A BROTHER
HIDE IT HERE?

403
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:36,308
I EXPECT IT'S 'CAUSE
HE WANTED SOMEBODY
TO FIND IT.

404
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,648
MIND WHERE YOU'RE GOING.

405
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:55,410
I'M SORRY.
I'LL--

406
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:58,079
- WHERE WERE YOU?
- A MAN HAS PATROL DUTY.

407
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,706
TYWIN LANNISTER
WAS RIGHT HERE

408
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,166
AND NOW HE'S GONE.

409
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:03,126
A GIRL OWES
ONE MORE NAME.

410
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,378
THE RED GOD DEMANDS IT.
GIVE THE MAN A NAME.

411
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,882
HOW LONG AFTER
I GIVE YOU THE NAME

412
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:10,967
DOES IT TAKE YOU
TO KILL SOMEONE?

413
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:15,639
A MINUTE, AN HOUR,
A MONTH.

414
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:19,851
DEATH IS CERTAIN,
THE TIME IS NOT.

415
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:22,145
HE'S TAKING HIS ARMY
TO ATTACK MY BROTHER.

416
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:25,106
I NEED HIM DEAD
RIGHT NOW.

417
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,192
THIS A MAN
CANNOT DO.

418
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:29,778
YOU PROMISED
YOU'D HELP ME.

419
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,821
HELP WAS NOT PROMISED,
LOVELY GIRL.

420
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:34,658
ONLY DEATH.
THERE MUST BE OTHERS.

421
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:37,160
GIVE A NAME,
ANY NAME.

422
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,120
AND YOU'LL KILL THEM?

423
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,206
ANYBODY?

424
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:47,462
BY THE SEVEN NEW GODS
AND THE OLD GODS
BEYOND COUNTING,

425
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:49,464
I SWEAR IT.

426
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:53,927
ALL RIGHT.

427
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:00,892
JAQEN H'GHAR.

428
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,401
A GIRL GIVES A MAN
HIS OWN NAME?

429
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:11,987
- THAT'S RIGHT.
-<i> GODS ARE NOT MOCKED.</i>

430
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,572
- THIS IS NO JOKING THING.
- I'M NOT JOKING.

431
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,324
A MAN CAN GO KILL HIMSELF.

432
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,159
- UN-NAME ME.
- NO.

433
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,495
PLEASE?

434
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,832
I'LL UN-NAME YOU.

435
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:26,626
- THANK YOU.
- IF YOU HELP ME
AND MY FRIENDS ESCAPE.

436
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:30,839
<i>THIS WOULD REQUIRE</i>
<i>MORE THAN ONE LIFE.</i>

437
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,925
-<i> THIS IS NOT</i>
<i>PART OF OUR BARGAIN.</i>
<i>- FINE, JAQEN H'GHAR.</i>

438
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:36,011
A GIRL LACKS HONOR.

439
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:46,688
IF I DO THIS THING,
A GIRL MUST OBEY.

440
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:50,317
A GIRL WILL OBEY.

441
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,611
A GIRL AND HER FRIENDS
WILL WALK THROUGH THE GATE
AT MIDNIGHT.

442
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:00,994
THANK YOU, PODRICK.

443
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:09,294
ODD LITTLE BOY.

444
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:11,463
I HAVE A CERTAIN SYMPATHY
FOR ODD LITTLE BOYS.

445
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:14,132
YOU AND VARYS BOTH.

446
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,927
EXCELLENT LAMPREY PIE.

447
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:20,638
WERE YOU SLAVING AWAY
IN THE KITCHEN ALL DAY?

448
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:23,391
I HEAR JOFFREY
PLANS ON FIGHTING.

449
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:26,019
AN INSPIRATION
FOR THE TROOPS.

450
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:27,812
THE YOUNG KING
IN HIS SHINING ARMOR

451
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:30,482
FIGHTING TO DEFEND THE CAPITAL
AGAINST THE WICKED OLD REBEL.

452
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:32,400
HE'S ONLY A BOY.

453
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,986
YOUNGER BOYS ARE OFF
FIGHTING HIS WAR.

454
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,738
HE'S NOT READY.

455
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,948
WHAT IS HE, 17?

456
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:41,785
- REMEMBER JAIME AT 17?
- BETTER THAN YOU.

457
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:44,704
SOME MEN HAVE A GIFT
FOR THIS SORT OF THING,

458
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:46,456
SOME DON'T.

459
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:48,583
HIS PLACE IS NOT
ON THE BATTLEFIELD.

460
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:50,752
IT'S NOT ON
THE THRONE, EITHER,

461
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:53,254
SADLY FOR ALL OF US.

462
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,468
DO YOU THINK
I'M AN IDIOT?

463
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:00,345
NO, I'D SAY YOU POSSESS
ABOVE AVERAGE INTELLIGENCE.

464
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:02,472
YOU SHIPPED OFF
MY ONLY DAUGHTER.

465
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:05,767
AND NOW YOU WANT
TO SEND MY ELDEST SON
TO THE BATTLEFIELD TO DIE.

466
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,061
HE'LL HAVE HIS KINGSGUARD
PROTECTING HIM.

467
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:11,106
HE HAS THE FINEST ARMOR
GOLD CAN BUY.

468
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:13,108
HE NEEDS TO BE OUT THERE.

469
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:15,902
THE MEN WILL FIGHT MORE
FIERCELY SEEING THEIR KING
FIGHTING BESIDE THEM

470
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:19,697
INSTEAD OF HIDING BEHIND
HIS MOTHER'S SKIRTS.

471
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,117
ANY DESSERT?

472
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,036
DO YOU KNOW WHY
VARYS IS SO DANGEROUS?

473
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,123
BECAUSE HE HAS THOUSANDS
OF SPIES IN HIS EMPLOY.

474
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:31,626
BECAUSE HE KNOWS EVERYTHING
WE DO BEFORE WE DO IT.

475
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:33,211
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T
HAVE A COCK.

476
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:35,672
NEITHER DO YOU.

477
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:39,300
PERHAPS I'M DANGEROUS, TOO.

478
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,261
YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND,

479
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,638
ARE AS BIG A FOOL
AS EVERY OTHER MAN.

480
00:28:43,721 --> 00:28:46,141
THAT LITTLE WORM
BETWEEN YOUR LEGS

481
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,725
DOES HALF YOUR THINKING.

482
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:50,603
- IT'S NOT THAT LITTLE.
- ( laughs )

483
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,485
WHY ARE YOU SMILING?

484
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:00,196
BECAUSE I'M HAPPY.

485
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,906
AND WHY ARE YOU HAPPY?

486
00:29:05,743 --> 00:29:08,788
BECAUSE I HAVE
YOUR LITTLE WHORE.

487
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:13,877
I THOUGHT YOU
PREFERRED BLONDES.

488
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,336
SUCH A DROLL LITTLE FELLOW.

489
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,046
TELL ME, HAVE YOU
MARRIED THIS ONE YET?

490
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,466
NO?

491
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:22,469
OH, GOOD.
FATHER WILL BE SO PLEASED.

492
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:24,012
WHY DO YOU CARE
WHO I FUCK?

493
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,723
BECAUSE A LANNISTER
ALWAYS PAYS HER DEBTS.

494
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:28,433
YOU STOLE MY ONLY DAUGHTER,

495
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:30,143
YOU PLOT TO HAVE
JOFFREY KILLED.

496
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:32,937
THIS IS MADNESS.
STANNIS WILL BE
HERE IN DAYS.

497
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,522
- YOU NEED ME.
- FOR WHAT?

498
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,816
YOUR SKILL IN BATTLE?

499
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,278
PRETTY THING, YOUR WHORE.

500
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:42,864
LOVELY BODY.

501
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:45,575
THE BRUISES
WILL HEAL IN TIME.

502
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,578
WHERE DID YOU FIND HER?

503
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:50,914
VARYS ISN'T THE ONLY ONE
WHO HEARS WHISPERS.

504
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:54,459
REALLY, A LANNISTER
LION NECKLACE?

505
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:57,629
YOU NEED TO HIDE
YOUR SECRET WHORES
MORE CAREFULLY.

506
00:29:57,712 --> 00:30:00,465
YOU'VE FORGOTTEN THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING ABOUT WHORES.

507
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:02,217
OH?

508
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,843
WELL, YOU'RE THE EXPERT.

509
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:06,179
TELL ME.

510
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:10,850
YOU DON'T BUY THEM;
YOU ONLY RENT THEM.

511
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:14,145
YOU'RE USUALLY
A BETTER LIAR,
BABY BROTHER.

512
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,231
THIS ONE YOU LIKE.

513
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:19,734
YOU LIKE HER VERY MUCH.

514
00:30:19,817 --> 00:30:21,736
COULD IT BE LOVE?

515
00:30:21,819 --> 00:30:25,448
DON'T WORRY,
SHE'LL BE TREATED
GENTLY ENOUGH...

516
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,242
UNLESS JOFFREY IS HURT.

517
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:30,870
AND THEN EVERY WOUND
HE SUFFERS SHE'LL SUFFER, TOO.

518
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:33,248
AND IF HE DIES,

519
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,250
THERE ISN'T A MAN ALIVE
WHO COULD DEVISE

520
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,503
A MORE PAINFUL DEATH
FOR YOUR LITTLE CUNT.

521
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:45,009
AND HOW DO I KNOW YOU
HAVEN'T KILLED HER ALREADY?

522
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:46,427
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE HER?

523
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,137
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT.

524
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:51,099
SER MANDON, BRING IN
MY BROTHER'S WHORE.

525
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,216
I'M SORRY THEY HURT YOU.

526
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:29,095
YOU MUST BE BRAVE.

527
00:31:33,891 --> 00:31:36,811
I PROMISE
I WILL FREE YOU.

528
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,647
DON'T FORGET ME.

529
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,899
NEVER.

530
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:52,952
<i>( door opens, closes )</i>

531
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:02,587
I WILL HURT YOU
FOR THIS.

532
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:06,174
A DAY WILL COME WHEN YOU
THINK YOU'RE SAFE AND HAPPY

533
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:10,386
AND YOUR JOY WILL TURN
TO ASHES IN YOUR MOUTH.

534
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:13,181
AND YOU WILL KNOW
THE DEBT IS PAID.

535
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:16,225
GET OUT.

536
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,822
SHAE!

537
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:34,369
I'VE BEEN WAITING
ALL NIGHT.

538
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,204
WHAT IS WRONG?

539
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,331
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

540
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,424
THEN WHY DO YOU LOOK SAD?

541
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,891
WE HAVE TO BE
MORE CAREFUL.

542
00:32:56,974 --> 00:32:59,977
DON'T BE AFRAID.
I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

543
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:03,231
THERE ARE PEOPLE
WHO WANT TO HURT ME.

544
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:05,608
I KNOW.
I WON'T LET THEM.

545
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:09,070
I'LL CUT OFF THEIR FACES.
I WILL.

546
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:16,953
I WOULD KILL FOR YOU.
DO YOU KNOW THAT?

547
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:20,707
I EXPECT I'LL HAVE TO
BEFORE THIS IS OVER.

548
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,919
YOU'RE MINE.

549
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,839
I'M YOURS.

550
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:30,174
PROMISE ME.

551
00:33:34,011 --> 00:33:37,557
I'M YOURS,
AND YOU ARE MINE.

552
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:50,403
Robb:
<i>STILL NO WORD?</i>

553
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:53,239
WE'VE SENT
A DOZEN RAVENS.

554
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:55,658
NONE HAVE RETURNED.

555
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:58,870
MY BASTARD IS ONLY
A FEW DAYS FROM WINTERFELL.

556
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:01,122
- ONCE HE CAPTURES THE CASTLE--
- THEON HAS MY BROTHERS.

557
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:05,460
- IF WE STORM THE CASTLE--
- HE WOULDN'T DARE
HURT THE BOYS.

558
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:09,505
THEY'RE HIS ONLY HOPE
OF ESCAPING THE NORTH
WITH HIS HEAD.

559
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,593
SEND WORD TO YOUR SON.

560
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,345
ANY IRONBORN WHO SURRENDER

561
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:19,682
WILL BE ALLOWED TO RETURN
SAFELY TO THEIR HOMES.

562
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:22,810
A TOUCH OF MERCY
IS A VIRTUE, YOUR GRACE.
TOO MUCH--

563
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:26,606
ANY IRONBORN
WITH THE EXCEPTION
OF THEON GREYJOY.

564
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:29,901
HE BETRAYED OUR CAUSE.

565
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:32,153
HE BETRAYED ME.

566
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:34,947
AND WE WILL HUNT HIM DOWN
NO MATTER WHERE HE RUNS.

567
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:38,618
I EXPECT HIS COUNTRYMEN
WILL TURN ON HIM THE MINUTE
THEY HEAR THE OFFER.

568
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:44,832
YOUR PARDON, MY LORD.
YOUR GRACE.

569
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,876
MY LADY.

570
00:34:58,221 --> 00:34:59,847
HOW ARE YOU?

571
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:02,809
HOW AM I?

572
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:05,144
I'VE HAD TO ARREST
MY MOTHER.

573
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:07,688
THE LANNISTERS
HAVE MY SISTERS.

574
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,565
THE MAN I CONSIDERED
MY CLOSEST FRIEND

575
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:12,276
HAS SEIZED MY HOME
AND MY BROTHERS.

576
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,571
I'M FIGHTING A WAR
AND I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD
MARCH SOUTH OR NORTH.

577
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:18,032
I'M SORRY.
IT WAS A STUPID QUESTION.

578
00:35:18,115 --> 00:35:20,201
- I'M SORRY.
- NO.

579
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,703
FORGIVE ME.

580
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,914
YOU'RE BEING KIND.
I HAVE NO RIGHT.

581
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:27,041
YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT.

582
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,417
YOU'RE A KING.

583
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:30,878
THAT'S NOT THE KIND
OF KING I WANT TO BE.

584
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:33,214
WHAT KIND DO YOU
WANT TO BE?

585
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:36,092
I DON'T KNOW.
THE GOOD KIND.

586
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,889
MOST KINGS GREW UP
AS PRINCES.

587
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,392
THEY SPEND THEIR WHOLE LIVES
PREPARING FOR THE CROWN.

588
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,894
I WAS RAISED TO BE
LORD OF WINTERFELL.

589
00:35:49,146 --> 00:35:51,899
I WAS RAISED TO BE
A PROPER LITTLE LADY,

590
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,861
TO PLAY THE HARP
AND DANCE THE LATEST STEPS

591
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,904
AND RECITE
VALYRIAN POETRY.

592
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,447
I'D LIKE TO HEAR YOU
PLAY THE HARP.

593
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:00,741
NO.
NO, YOU WOULD NOT.

594
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,827
( laughs )

595
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:09,417
HOW DID YOU GO FROM
RECITING VALYRIAN POETRY

596
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,627
TO SAWING OFF
MEN'S FEET?

597
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,764
WHEN I WAS 12,

598
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,559
MY MOTHER AND FATHER
WENT TO A WEDDING.

599
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:29,729
WEDDINGS IN VOLANTIS
LAST FOR DAYS, YOU KNOW.

600
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:32,023
AND THEY LEFT ME
WITH MY LITTLE BROTHER.

601
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:35,735
THE SECOND AFTERNOON
THEY WERE GONE

602
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:38,779
WAS THE HOTTEST DAY
IN THE THREE-YEAR SUMMER.

603
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:42,283
WE COULDN'T BEAR TO BE INSIDE,
SO WE RAN DOWN TO THE RHOYNE.

604
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:45,870
EVERY CHILD IN VOLANTIS
WAS IN THE RHOYNE THAT DAY.

605
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,957
<i>THE RICH, THE POOR,</i>
<i>WE WERE ALL THERE,</i>

606
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:53,169
NAKED, SCREAMING, RACING
TO THE LITTLE ISLANDS.

607
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:56,047
DRUMMERS WERE PLAYING
FOR COPPERS ON THE EAST BANK.

608
00:37:00,217 --> 00:37:02,803
I WAS TREADING WATER,

609
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,056
TALKING TO A FRIEND

610
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:07,725
WHEN I REALIZED
I HADN'T SEEN MY BROTHER.

611
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:11,938
I CALLED HIS NAME.

612
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:14,774
THEN I STARTED
SCREAMING HIS NAME.

613
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:19,236
AND THEN I SAW HIM

614
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,530
FLOATING FACEDOWN.

615
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,743
MY HEART JUST...
STOPPED.

616
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:27,745
I WAS...

617
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:33,709
I DRAGGED HIM
FROM THE WATER.

618
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:36,212
MY FRIEND HELPED ME,
I THINK.

619
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:38,506
I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER.

620
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:44,178
HE WAS SO LITTLE.

621
00:37:44,261 --> 00:37:46,514
THEN WE PULLED HIM
ONTO THE RIVERBANK...

622
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,851
AND I SCREAMED AT HIM

623
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:53,187
AND I SHOOK HIM

624
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:55,523
AND HE WAS DEAD.

625
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:58,693
JUST DEAD.

626
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:04,865
A MAN RAN OVER.

627
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:09,829
HE HAD A FISH
TATTOO ON HIS FACE.

628
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:13,541
IN VOLANTIS THE SLAVES
HAVE TATTOOS

629
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:16,877
SO YOU KNOW
WHAT THEY ARE WITHOUT
HAVING TO TALK TO THEM.

630
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,547
AND THIS MAN WORKED
ON A FISHING BOAT.

631
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:23,092
AND HE PUSHED ME
OUT OF THE WAY.

632
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:25,011
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND,

633
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:28,222
FOR A SLAVE TO PUSH
A HIGHBORN GIRL--

634
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:32,101
THAT'S DEATH FOR THE MAN,
A TERRIBLE DEATH.

635
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:35,980
BUT HE PUSHED ME
OUT OF THE WAY

636
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:40,317
AND HE STARTED PRESSING
ON MY BROTHER'S CHEST

637
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:44,822
AGAIN AND AGAIN
AND AGAIN

638
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:48,200
UNTIL MY BROTHER
SPAT OUT

639
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,619
HALF OF THE RHOYNE

640
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:52,038
AND CRIED OUT.

641
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:55,541
AND THE MAN CRADLED HIS HEAD
AND TOLD HIM TO BE CALM.

642
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:04,675
I DECIDED
TWO THINGS THAT DAY.

643
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,552
I WOULD NOT
WASTE MY YEARS

644
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:10,598
PLANNING DANCES
AND MASQUERADES WITH
THE OTHER NOBLE LADIES.

645
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:14,810
AND WHEN
I CAME OF AGE...

646
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:17,313
I WOULD NEVER LIVE
IN A SLAVE CITY AGAIN.

647
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:26,822
( sighs )
I'M SORRY, YOUR GRACE.

648
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:29,950
YOU TOLD ME OF YOUR PROBLEMS
AND I'VE BLATHERED ON.

649
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,495
I DON'T WANT TO MARRY
THE FREY GIRL.

650
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:38,084
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO MARRY HER.

651
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:44,006
BUT YOU NEEDED
THAT BRIDGE.

652
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:48,969
I HOPE IT'S A VERY
BEAUTIFUL BRIDGE.

653
00:40:26,423 --> 00:40:28,551
( laughs )

654
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:56,912
Hot Pie:
<i>THE SOUR CHERRIES WAS ALL</i>
<i>CRUSHED UP AND READY.</i>

655
00:40:56,996 --> 00:41:00,583
- Gendry:<i> SHUT UP.</i>
<i>- PROBABLY IN THE PIECRUST</i>
<i>BY NOW.</i>

656
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:03,878
IN THE OVEN,
THE NICE WARM OVEN.

657
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,547
SHUT UP.
WHAT DID YOU BRING?

658
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,465
THE CHEESE
COULD BE BETTER.

659
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:10,009
I DID GET SOME
NICE SAUSAGES.

660
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:13,137
WHAT DID HE WANT US
TO DO ABOUT THOSE GUARDS?

661
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,722
HE DIDN'T SAY.

662
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,098
HE JUST SAID,
"WALK THROUGH THE GATES.

663
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:18,017
Gendry:
<i>WHAT ABOUT THE GUARDS?</i>

664
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,852
<i>HE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING</i>
<i>ABOUT THE GUARDS.</i>

665
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:21,478
WHAT, HE LEFT THAT BIT OUT?

666
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,022
IT'S A PRETTY IMPORTANT PART,
DON'T YOU THINK?

667
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:26,150
- WE HAVE TO TRUST HIM.
-<i> TRUST HIM?</i>

668
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:28,485
YOU TRUSTED HIM
TO FIGHT WITH US
AND YOU SET HIM FREE

669
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:30,571
- AND HE RAN.
- I WANT TO GO BACK
TO THE KITCHENS.

670
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:33,908
SHUT UP.
STAY HERE IF YOU'RE AFRAID.

671
00:41:36,493 --> 00:41:38,954
Hot Pie:
ARRY, DON'T.

672
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:09,276
AWAY!
RESET!

673
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:20,829
IF THE WIND HOLDS,
WE'LL REACH KING'S
LANDING IN A DAY.

674
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:22,456
WILL IT HOLD?

675
00:42:22,539 --> 00:42:25,125
CAN'T MAKE PROMISES
FOR THE WIND, YOUR GRACE.

676
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:29,046
Man:
<i>AGAIN, PULL!</i>

677
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:33,008
I ADMIRE YOU, SER DAVOS.

678
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:36,387
I THANK YOU, YOUR GRACE.
PLEASED TO HEAR IT.

679
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,639
SOME HIGHBORN FOOLS
CALL YOU ONION KNIGHT

680
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,432
AND THINK
THEY INSULT YOU.

681
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:42,851
SO YOU TAKE THE ONION
FOR YOUR SIGIL,

682
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:45,312
SEW IT ON YOUR COAT,
FLY THE ONION FLAG.

683
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,481
MY SON WISHES ME
TO CHANGE IT.

684
00:42:47,564 --> 00:42:50,776
THREE MERMEN WITH TRIDENTS,
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

685
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:54,488
I UNDERSTAND WHY
THE OLDER FAMILIES
LOOK DOWN AT ME.

686
00:42:54,571 --> 00:42:56,699
DO YOU?
WHY?

687
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:59,868
- MY FATHER WAS A CRABBER.
- AND?

688
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:03,455
WELL, SONS OF LORDS
DON'T LIKE TO BREAK BREAD
WITH SONS OF CRABBERS.

689
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:05,457
OUR HANDS STINK.

690
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:08,002
AND WHERE WERE THOSE LORDS
WHEN STORM'S END STARVED?

691
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:10,504
MANY FOUGHT BRAVELY
FOR YOUR BROTHER.

692
00:43:10,587 --> 00:43:13,007
MANY FOUGHT
FOR THE MAD KING.

693
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:16,885
YOU DEFEND THESE MEN
WHO INSULT YOU BEHIND
YOUR BACK.

694
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:19,346
SOME ARE HAPPY
TO DO IT TO MY FACE.

695
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,557
WE WERE FORGOTTEN.

696
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,184
ROBERT AND NED STARK--
THEY WERE THE HEROES,

697
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:28,063
THE GLORIOUS REBELS MARCHING
FROM BATTLE TO BATTLE,

698
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:30,649
LIBERATING TOWNS FROM
THE YOKE OF THE MAD KING

699
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:33,193
WHILE I HELD STORM'S END
WITH 500 MEN.

700
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,195
- NO ONE HAS
FORGOTTEN, YOUR GRACE.
- NO? ROBERT DID.

701
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,406
HE GAVE STORM'S END
TO RENLY AFTER THE WAR.

702
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:39,074
RENLY NEVER FOUGHT
A DAY IN HIS LIFE.

703
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:41,952
- HE WAS ONLY A BOY.
- THEN WHY'D HE GIVE HIM
STORM'S END?

704
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:48,334
FIRST WE ATE THE HORSES.

705
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:51,879
WE WEREN'T RIDING ANYWAY,
NOT WITH THE CASTLE SURROUNDED.

706
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:54,548
WE COULDN'T FEED THEM,
SO FINE, THE HORSES.

707
00:43:54,631 --> 00:43:56,383
THEN THE CATS.
NEVER LIKED CATS.

708
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:59,386
SO FINE.
I DO LIKE DOGS.

709
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,888
GOOD ANIMALS.
LOYAL.

710
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:03,515
BUT WE ATE THEM.
THEN THE RATS.

711
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,601
THE NIGHT BEFORE
YOU SLIPPED THROUGH,

712
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:07,644
I THOUGHT MY WIFE
WAS DYING.

713
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:09,730
SHE COULDN'T SPEAK ANYMORE,
SHE WAS SO FRAIL.

714
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:13,108
AND THEN YOU MADE IT
THROUGH THE LINES.

715
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:16,403
SLIPPED RIGHT THROUGH IN
YOUR LITTLE BLACK SAILBOAT
WITH YOUR ONIONS.

716
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:19,156
AND POTATOES.
SOME SALTED BEEF,
I BELIEVE.

717
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:21,992
EVERY MAN IN STORM'S END
WANTED TO KISS YOU THAT NIGHT.

718
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:24,411
I WAS RELIEVED
THEY DID NOT.

719
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:30,918
ROBERT TOLD ME TO HOLD
STORM'S END, SO I HELD IT.

720
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:33,253
THEN HE TOLD ME
HE WAS GIVING IT TO RENLY,

721
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:34,588
SO I GAVE IT UP.

722
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,965
INSULT OR NO,
I GAVE IT UP

723
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:39,259
BECAUSE ROBERT
WAS MY OLDER BROTHER
AND HE WAS THE KING

724
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:41,345
AND I'VE ALWAYS
DONE MY DUTY.

725
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:45,349
BUT NOW I'M
THE RIGHTFUL KING BY
EVERY LAW OF WESTEROS.

726
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:47,935
AND WHEN I SIT
THE IRON THRONE,
YOU'LL BE MY HAND.

727
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:52,981
YOUR GRACE...

728
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:58,153
I PRAY I SERVE YOU WELL.

729
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:01,115
I EXPECT YOU'LL BE
THE FIRST CRABBER'S SON
TO WEAR THE BADGE.

730
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:07,162
YOU'RE THE MASTER
OF WHISPERERS.

731
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:08,872
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO KNOW EVERYTHING.

732
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:11,792
NO MAN CAN BE IN ALL
ROOMS AT ALL TIMES.

733
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:14,920
I HAVE MANY LITTLE BIRDS
IN THE NORTH, MY LORD,

734
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:16,672
BUT I HAVEN'T HEARD
THEIR SONGS

735
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:19,341
SINCE THEON GREYJOY
CAPTURED WINTERFELL.

736
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:21,176
THE STARK FORCES
ARE DISTRACTED.

737
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,970
NOW IS THE TIME
TO STRIKE.

738
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:24,805
TO STRIKE?

739
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:26,849
MY DEAR NEPHEW,
YOU DO SEE THESE MEN

740
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:28,642
PREPARING THE WALLS
FOR SIEGE?

741
00:45:28,725 --> 00:45:32,020
YOU DO UNDERSTAND
STANNIS BARATHEON
SAILS THIS WAY?

742
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:34,481
IF MY UNCLE STANNIS
LANDS ON THE SHORES
OF KING'S LANDING,

743
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,483
I'LL RIDE OUT
TO GREET HIM.

744
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,610
A BRAVE CHOICE,
YOUR GRACE.

745
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:41,280
I'M SURE YOUR MEN
WILL LINE UP BEHIND YOU.

746
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:44,199
THEY SAY STANNIS
NEVER SMILES.

747
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:47,119
I'LL GIVE HIM
A RED SMILE

748
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:49,204
FROM EAR TO EAR.

749
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:56,545
IMAGINE STANNIS'S TERROR.

750
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:58,797
I AM TRYING.

751
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,675
YOU'RE
AN INTELLIGENT MAN.

752
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,427
I'D LIKE TO THINK
I'M AN INTELLIGENT MAN.

753
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:04,887
OH, NO ONE DISPUTES
THAT, MY LORD,

754
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:07,222
NOT EVEN THE MULTITUDES
WHO DESPISE YOU.

755
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:10,058
I WISH WE COULD
CONVERSE AS TWO HONEST,
INTELLIGENT MEN.

756
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:12,060
I WISH WE COULD, TOO.

757
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:16,482
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

758
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:18,692
TELL ME.

759
00:46:18,775 --> 00:46:20,569
IF WE'RE GOING TO PLAY,

760
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:22,905
YOU'LL HAVE TO START.

761
00:46:26,783 --> 00:46:30,704
MY BROTHER WAS THE YOUNGEST
KINGSGUARD IN HISTORY.

762
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:34,541
MY SISTER BECAME QUEEN
AT THE AGE OF 19.

763
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:38,545
WHEN I REACHED MANHOOD,

764
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:42,549
MY FATHER PUT ME
IN CHARGE OF ALL THE DRAINS
AND CISTERNS IN CASTERLY ROCK.

765
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,551
A MOST HIGHBORN PLUMBER.

766
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,637
THE WATER NEVER
FLOWED BETTER.

767
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,640
AND ALL THE SHIT
FOUND ITS WAY TO THE SEA.

768
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:52,434
I NEVER EXPECTED
TO HAVE ANY REAL POWER.

769
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:54,728
SO WHEN MY FATHER
NAMED ME ACTING HAND--

770
00:46:54,811 --> 00:46:56,647
YOU'RE QUITE GOOD
AT BEING HAND, YOU KNOW?

771
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:59,608
JON ARRYN AND NED STARK
WERE GOOD MEN,

772
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:01,735
HONORABLE MEN,

773
00:47:01,818 --> 00:47:04,530
BUT THEY DISDAINED THE GAME
AND THOSE WHO PLAYED.

774
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:07,282
- YOU ENJOY THE GAME.
- I DO.

775
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:09,743
LAST THING I EXPECTED.

776
00:47:09,826 --> 00:47:11,286
AND YOU PLAY IT WELL.

777
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:13,372
I'D LIKE TO KEEP
PLAYING IT.

778
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:18,293
IF STANNIS BREACHES
THE GATES, THE GAME IS OVER.

779
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:21,171
THEY SAY HE BURNS
HIS ENEMIES ALIVE

780
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:23,215
TO HONOR
THE LORD OF LIGHT.

781
00:47:23,298 --> 00:47:25,467
THE LORD OF LIGHT
WANTS HIS ENEMIES BURNED,

782
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:28,095
THE DROWNED GOD
WANTS THEM DROWNED.

783
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:30,138
WHY ARE ALL THE GODS
SUCH VICIOUS CUNTS?

784
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:33,684
WHERE IS THE GOD
OF TITS AND WINE?

785
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:35,519
IN THE SUMMER ISLES,

786
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:38,605
THEY WORSHIP A FERTILITY
GODDESS WITH 16 TEATS.

787
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:41,441
WE SHOULD SAIL THERE
IMMEDIATELY.

788
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:46,446
THIS MORNING
I HEARD A SONG

789
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:50,200
ALL THE WAY FROM QARTH
BEYOND THE RED WASTE.

790
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:53,412
DAENERYS TARGARYEN LIVES.

791
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:56,290
A GIRL AT THE EDGE
OF THE WORLD IS THE LEAST
OF OUR PROBLEMS.

792
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:58,792
SHE HAS THREE DRAGONS.

793
00:48:00,752 --> 00:48:03,005
BUT EVEN IF WHAT
THEY SAY IS TRUE,

794
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:05,966
IT'LL BE YEARS BEFORE
THEY ARE FULLY GROWN.

795
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:08,635
AND THEN THERE WILL BE
NOWHERE TO HIDE.

796
00:48:10,345 --> 00:48:12,014
ONE GAME AT A TIME,
MY FRIEND.

797
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:14,558
( men shouting )

798
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:24,776
Jorah:
<i>CAREFUL, KHALEESI.</i>

799
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:29,531
<i>XARO OWNS THIS CITY</i>
<i>AND THE WARLOCKS HAVE 1,000</i>
<i>EYES WATCHING FOR YOU.</i>

800
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:32,576
I FOUND ONE--

801
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:34,911
A SHIP WITH
A GOOD CAPTAIN.

802
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:37,706
SHE LEAVES FOR
ASTAPOR TOMORROW.

803
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:39,791
- ASTAPOR?
- WE CANNOT STAY HERE.

804
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:43,170
THEY HAVE MY DRAGONS.
A MOTHER DOES NOT FLEE
WITHOUT HER CHILDREN.

805
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:45,172
THEY'RE NOT YOUR CHILDREN.

806
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:47,841
I KNOW THEY CALL YOU
THE MOTHER OF DRAGONS

807
00:48:47,924 --> 00:48:50,636
AND I KNOW YOU LOVE THEM,
BUT YOU DIDN'T GROW THEM
IN YOUR WOMB.

808
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:53,263
THEY DIDN'T
SUCKLE AT YOUR BREAST.
THEY ARE DRAGONS, KHALEESI.

809
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:55,724
AND IF WE STAY
IN QARTH, WE'LL DIE.

810
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:58,935
YOU SHOULD SAIL TO ASTAPOR.
I'M SURE YOU'LL BE SAFE THERE.

811
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:04,524
YOU KNOW
I WOULD DIE FOR YOU.

812
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:07,152
I WILL NEVER
ABANDON YOU.

813
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:09,488
I'M SWORN TO PROTECT YOU,
TO SERVE.

814
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:11,531
THEN SERVE ME.

815
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:15,035
IF MY DRAGONS ARE IN
THE HOUSE OF THE UNDYING,
THEN TAKE ME THERE.

816
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:17,037
THAT'S WHAT
THE WARLOCK WANTS.

817
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,914
HE TOLD YOU SO HIMSELF.

818
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:21,541
IF YOU ENTER THAT PLACE,
YOU WILL NEVER LEAVE AGAIN.

819
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:24,670
- HIS MAGIC IS STRONG.
- AND WHAT OF MY MAGIC?

820
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:26,630
YOU SAW ME STEP
INTO THE FIRE.

821
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:29,174
YOU WATCHED THE WITCH BURN.
WHAT DID THE FLAMES DO TO ME?

822
00:49:29,257 --> 00:49:31,009
DO YOU REMEMBER?

823
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:36,014
UNTIL MY LAST BREATH
I WILL REMEMBER.

824
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:40,602
AFTER I HAVE FORGOTTEN
MY MOTHER'S FACE.

825
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:47,734
THEY ARE MY CHILDREN.

826
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:51,988
AND THEY ARE THE ONLY
CHILDREN I WILL EVER HAVE.

827
00:49:57,786 --> 00:49:59,788
TAKE ME TO THEM.

828
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,969
WE SHOULD BURY THEM.

829
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:16,430
I'D LEAVE 'EM UP
A FEW MORE DAYS.

830
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:18,432
SENDS A MESSAGE.

831
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:20,058
IF THEY HAVEN'T GOT
THE DAMN MESSAGE YET,

832
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:22,269
A FEW MORE DAYS
WON'T HELP.

833
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:23,854
AS YOU SAY.

834
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:26,732
BUT IT DON'T HURT TO LET
'EM ROT A WHILE LONGER.

835
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:28,608
WHAT'S THIS?

836
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:31,069
GOLD FOR THE FARMER.

837
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:33,655
FOR HIS TROUBLE.

838
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:35,115
HIS TROUBLES ARE DONE.

839
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:38,660
HE'S FEEDING
THE CROPS NOW.

840
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:40,704
<i>HIS WIFE, TOO.</i>

841
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:44,958
YOU WANT TO KEEP A MAN
SILENT, YOU SILENCE HIM.

842
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:08,064
GOT AS FAR AS THE FARM
AND THEN DOUBLED BACK.

843
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:13,069
WALKED THROUGH THE STREAM
TO THROW OFF THE HOUNDS.

844
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:18,450
HOPED THIS WOULD
BE THE LAST PLACE
THEY'D THINK TO LOOK.

845
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:22,746
YOU'RE RIGHT...

846
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:25,332
SO FAR.

847
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:27,667
WHO WAS THAT OUT THERE

848
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:30,378
HUNG UP AT THE GATES?

849
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:33,048
MUST HAVE BEEN
THE FARMER'S BOYS.

850
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:37,969
HE KILLED THEM
AND BURNED THEM

851
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:40,639
<i>AND PASSED THEM OFF</i>
<i>AS THE LITTLE LORDS?</i>

852
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:42,349
SHH, SHH, SHH.

853
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:45,143
<i>THEY MUSTN'T KNOW.</i>

854
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:47,771
<i>BRAN WOULD BLAME</i>
<i>HIMSELF.</i>

855
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:51,525
Osha:
<i>THEY'LL NEVER</i>
<i>HEAR IT FROM ME.</i>

856
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:54,611
<i>THE LITTLE LADS</i>
<i>HAVE SUFFERED ENOUGH.</i>

857
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:04,120
