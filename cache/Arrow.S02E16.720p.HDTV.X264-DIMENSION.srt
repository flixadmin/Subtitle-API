1
00:00:00,689 --> 00:00:02,188
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,444 --> 00:00:05,978
After five years
on a hellish island,

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:09,215
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:11,150
to save my city.

5
00:00:11,152 --> 00:00:14,286
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:14,288 --> 00:00:19,191
To honor my friend's memory,
I must be someone else.

7
00:00:19,193 --> 00:00:23,362
I must be something else.

8
00:00:23,364 --> 00:00:25,197
Previously on "Arrow"...

9
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,066
When I was in Afghanistan,
my unit was tasked

10
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:30,403
with protecting Gholem Qadir.

11
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,438
How is it you think
your brother ended up dead?

12
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,540
You shot at a client,
you missed.

13
00:00:34,542 --> 00:00:36,142
I don't miss.

14
00:00:36,144 --> 00:00:37,910
You murdered Shado.

15
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:42,515
Yes, I pulled the trigger,
but you, you aimed the gun.

16
00:00:47,921 --> 00:00:50,022
What are you
doing here?

17
00:00:50,024 --> 00:00:51,891
Five years ago,
I made you a promise.

18
00:00:51,893 --> 00:00:56,462
You cannot die until you have known
complete despair.

19
00:00:56,464 --> 00:00:59,432
And you will.
I promise.

20
00:01:15,816 --> 00:01:18,651
Sara.

21
00:01:22,122 --> 00:01:24,090
Sara?

22
00:01:24,092 --> 00:01:25,958
Murderer.

23
00:01:46,747 --> 00:01:51,083
Mne nuzhno
vstretit'sya svami.

24
00:02:01,027 --> 00:02:03,863
Aleksi. Kak Ty, moy drug?

25
00:02:03,865 --> 00:02:05,931
What can I
do for you?

26
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:09,001
There's no gulags here
in Starling City.

27
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:11,971
Anatoly talks too much.

28
00:02:11,973 --> 00:02:14,206
Eto verno.

29
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:16,041
I need you
to find a man for me.

30
00:02:16,043 --> 00:02:18,844
His name is Slade Wilson.
He's rich, Australian,

31
00:02:18,846 --> 00:02:20,212
and he's missing an eye.

32
00:02:20,214 --> 00:02:21,947
I need to know
where he sleeps.

33
00:02:21,949 --> 00:02:24,650
First, I need your assistance
with my business.

34
00:02:24,652 --> 00:02:29,088
There is a man who owes me
a substantial amount of money.

35
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:30,189
I am not here to trade.

36
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:32,558
You know how our
brotherhood works.

37
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,027
I do a favor for you

38
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,695
and you do one for me.

39
00:02:36,697 --> 00:02:39,465
Put it on my tab, Aleksi.

40
00:02:39,467 --> 00:02:42,234
I don't have time
for these games.

41
00:02:42,236 --> 00:02:44,537
Make time.

42
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,572
My services are
of no use to you

43
00:02:46,574 --> 00:02:49,842
unless yours
are use to me.

44
00:03:04,925 --> 00:03:08,027
I know exactly
how this brotherhood works,

45
00:03:08,029 --> 00:03:10,696
and right now,
it works for me.

46
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:16,393
U nas yest' ponimaniye?

49
00:03:25,445 --> 00:03:27,580
I woke up
and you were gone.

50
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:30,049
Yeah. I wasn't tired.

51
00:03:30,051 --> 00:03:31,717
You should be.

52
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:33,485
When's the last time
you actually slept?

53
00:03:33,487 --> 00:03:35,187
Right before I found out

54
00:03:35,189 --> 00:03:37,389
that Slade Wilson
is still alive.

55
00:03:38,825 --> 00:03:40,960
Do you want to talk?

56
00:03:40,962 --> 00:03:43,862
I mean...

57
00:03:43,864 --> 00:03:47,099
I know neither one of us are very
good about sharing our feelings,

58
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:50,569
but...I mean, I get it.

59
00:03:50,571 --> 00:03:52,438
Slade, and...

60
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,407
And it's a lot,
and, you know,

61
00:03:55,409 --> 00:03:57,776
it's ok if you're scared.
I am, too.

62
00:03:57,778 --> 00:04:00,946
I'm not scared.
Slade came back

63
00:04:00,948 --> 00:04:02,781
to Starling City
with an agenda.

64
00:04:02,783 --> 00:04:05,150
First, he tries to mass produce
the Mirakuru.

65
00:04:05,152 --> 00:04:07,086
Then he shows up...

66
00:04:07,088 --> 00:04:09,855
at my mother's
house.

67
00:04:09,857 --> 00:04:11,690
So he wants
a fight, fine.

68
00:04:11,692 --> 00:04:13,359
I'll give him a fight.
And this time,

69
00:04:13,361 --> 00:04:15,294
when I kill him,
I will make damn sure

70
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,429
that he stays dead.

71
00:04:17,431 --> 00:04:20,599
I just need
to find him.

72
00:04:43,023 --> 00:04:45,291
Ooh, coffee?

73
00:04:45,293 --> 00:04:47,259
Hot cocoa.
Hmm.

74
00:04:47,261 --> 00:04:48,694
What, no
marshmallows?

75
00:04:48,696 --> 00:04:50,696
I'm out.

76
00:04:50,698 --> 00:04:52,631
What are you doing here, Dig?

77
00:04:52,633 --> 00:04:53,966
Keeping an eye
on things.

78
00:04:53,968 --> 00:04:56,635
Ok. And by things,
you mean my neck.

79
00:04:56,637 --> 00:04:58,771
The one you think Slade Wilson's
going to break in my sleep.

80
00:04:58,773 --> 00:05:00,239
Yeah, something
like that.

81
00:05:00,241 --> 00:05:02,675
Look, I have extra
security details

82
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,243
on Oliver's mother.

83
00:05:04,245 --> 00:05:06,145
Roy's keeping
an eye on Thea,

84
00:05:06,147 --> 00:05:07,613
Sara's staying
close to Laurel.

85
00:05:07,615 --> 00:05:10,249
So I get you sitting
outside of my house

86
00:05:10,251 --> 00:05:13,018
like that lacrosse player
my freshman year of college.

87
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,653
What?

88
00:05:14,655 --> 00:05:17,389
You know, I had a life
before you and Oliver, yeah?

89
00:05:17,391 --> 00:05:21,026
Right. I just want to make sure
you're ok, Felicity.

90
00:05:21,028 --> 00:05:23,028
And I love you for it.

91
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,164
But if Slade wants
to kill me, he can.

92
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,666
There's nothing you can do
to stop him.

93
00:05:27,668 --> 00:05:31,070
So go home. Ok?

94
00:05:34,207 --> 00:05:37,409
Hey.

95
00:05:37,411 --> 00:05:39,211
Nice jammies.

96
00:06:06,606 --> 00:06:09,108
What took you so long?

97
00:06:10,844 --> 00:06:13,312
What is all this?

98
00:06:13,314 --> 00:06:16,682
A little early for champagne,
don't you think?

99
00:06:16,684 --> 00:06:19,618
Not for me.

100
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,287
I just got back
from a mission in Pyongyang.

101
00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:25,190
Well, damn.

102
00:06:25,192 --> 00:06:27,226
That was you?

103
00:06:27,228 --> 00:06:31,663
I'm sorry.
That's classified information.

104
00:06:31,665 --> 00:06:35,701
But I missed my ex-husband,
new boyfriend.

105
00:06:35,703 --> 00:06:38,103
And A.R.G.U.S. has
a standing reservation

106
00:06:38,105 --> 00:06:40,739
at this hotel
for very important assets.

107
00:06:40,741 --> 00:06:42,107
Mm-hmm.

108
00:06:42,109 --> 00:06:43,909
Can you stay?

109
00:06:43,911 --> 00:06:46,912
Um, well, Oliver
and I kind of have

110
00:06:46,914 --> 00:06:50,215
a...situation.

111
00:06:50,217 --> 00:06:52,217
Everything all right?

112
00:06:52,219 --> 00:06:56,321
Yeah, yeah,
we're handling it.

113
00:06:56,323 --> 00:06:59,091
So you can stay.

114
00:07:02,095 --> 00:07:05,297
Mmm.

115
00:07:08,234 --> 00:07:10,302
Hey.

116
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:12,971
Is there a problem,
Michaels?

117
00:07:12,973 --> 00:07:15,808
We need to rest.
These women are tired.

118
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,276
We're all tired.

119
00:07:17,278 --> 00:07:19,344
It's a long hike back to camp.
Keep going.

120
00:07:19,346 --> 00:07:22,448
Shall I go explain to the ladies
why they want to get back before dark?

121
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,216
They're not allowed
to talk to you.

122
00:07:24,218 --> 00:07:26,185
Why, 'cause I'm an American?
Because you're a man.

123
00:07:26,187 --> 00:07:28,487
Five minutes.

124
00:07:34,094 --> 00:07:36,462
Girls in the military.
Can't keep up,

125
00:07:36,464 --> 00:07:38,297
don't join up, right?

126
00:08:05,692 --> 00:08:07,526
Whoa, whoa, hey,
what's going on here?

127
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,628
What's going on?

128
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,563
You recognize that face?

129
00:08:11,565 --> 00:08:15,868
You should. He's on the U.S. military's
high value target list.

130
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,035
Gholem Qadir.

131
00:08:17,037 --> 00:08:19,538
Opium drug lord
and arms dealer.

132
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,440
Wanted alive.

133
00:08:29,415 --> 00:08:32,918
What were you saying
about women in the military?

134
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,220
Why didn't we do fun stuff like this
when we were married?

135
00:08:35,222 --> 00:08:38,524
And take time out from our busy schedule
of driving each other crazy?

136
00:08:39,893 --> 00:08:41,260
Amanda.

137
00:08:41,262 --> 00:08:43,962
Don't look so worried,
agent Michaels.

138
00:08:43,964 --> 00:08:45,597
We've all
availed ourselves

139
00:08:45,599 --> 00:08:48,300
of the Ostrander suite at some point
in our careers.

140
00:08:48,302 --> 00:08:51,703
Something's come up,
I'll need you to come with me.

141
00:08:51,705 --> 00:08:53,372
Duty calls.

142
00:08:53,374 --> 00:08:54,640
Yeah, guess so.

143
00:08:54,642 --> 00:08:56,375
Actually...

144
00:08:56,377 --> 00:08:58,343
I meant both of you.

145
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:02,114
What are we
looking at here?

146
00:09:02,116 --> 00:09:05,217
Hydroxy-cyclosarin.
It's a nerve agent.

147
00:09:05,219 --> 00:09:06,852
The apocalypse in the form
of a chemical weapon.

148
00:09:06,854 --> 00:09:09,821
And it's about to hit
the open market.

149
00:09:09,823 --> 00:09:11,156
A.R.G.U.S. agents
uncovered

150
00:09:11,158 --> 00:09:12,824
a manufacturing plant
in Kahndaq.

151
00:09:12,826 --> 00:09:15,827
All samples were accounted for,
except for one.

152
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:18,964
Two weeks later,
this footage

153
00:09:18,966 --> 00:09:21,066
was captured in a remote village
in southern Qurac.

154
00:09:21,068 --> 00:09:23,669
One milliliter has a kill radius
of ten miles.

155
00:09:23,671 --> 00:09:26,471
It only took half that amount
to produce these results.

156
00:09:26,473 --> 00:09:30,576
Our sources have traced the sample
through Europe to an estate in Markovia.

157
00:09:30,578 --> 00:09:32,344
So send in the army.

158
00:09:32,346 --> 00:09:34,279
We send in the army, we risk
an international spectacle

159
00:09:34,281 --> 00:09:36,181
our government
can't afford.

160
00:09:36,183 --> 00:09:37,916
This has to be off-book.

161
00:09:37,918 --> 00:09:40,485
If you need me to draw up
the smash and grab, done.

162
00:09:40,487 --> 00:09:44,256
But John isn't a field agent.
He's not qualified.

163
00:09:44,258 --> 00:09:47,526
Judging from how he and Oliver Queen
spend their free time,

164
00:09:47,528 --> 00:09:49,995
I'd say
his credits transfer.

165
00:09:49,997 --> 00:09:52,197
Hey, look, I don't want this thing out
in the open any more than you do,

166
00:09:52,199 --> 00:09:55,534
but I'm not sending my boss in
on another one of your business trips.

167
00:09:55,536 --> 00:09:58,036
I have no intention
of involving the Arrow.

168
00:09:58,038 --> 00:09:59,605
I need you.

169
00:09:59,607 --> 00:10:01,673
What for?

170
00:10:01,675 --> 00:10:03,675
Gholem Qadir.

171
00:10:03,677 --> 00:10:05,310
We caught him.

172
00:10:05,312 --> 00:10:07,012
D.O.D. turned Qadir
loose a few years ago.

173
00:10:07,014 --> 00:10:08,914
Who thought
that was a good idea?

174
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,749
It's a complicated
world, Johnny.

175
00:10:10,751 --> 00:10:12,851
The nerve agent's
not the only WMD

176
00:10:12,853 --> 00:10:14,987
Qadir's tried getting
his scummy fingers on.

177
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,722
Last month, he tried
to buy Malcolm Merlyn's

178
00:10:16,724 --> 00:10:18,357
prototype
earthquake machine.

179
00:10:18,359 --> 00:10:21,193
Thank you for stopping that,
by the way.

180
00:10:21,195 --> 00:10:24,029
Fortunately, he doesn't know about
your involvement in that.

181
00:10:24,031 --> 00:10:27,766
He remembers you as the man
who tried to save his life.

182
00:10:27,768 --> 00:10:29,968
The nerve agent's
under lock and key

183
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,536
at his estate in Markovia.

184
00:10:31,538 --> 00:10:33,739
He's scheduled to host
a fundraiser there shortly.

185
00:10:33,741 --> 00:10:35,674
The two of us haven't
exactly kept in touch.

186
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:40,312
We've got that covered,
but our window is rapidly closing.

187
00:10:43,249 --> 00:10:45,584
Ok.

188
00:10:45,586 --> 00:10:47,953
So I infiltrate the fundraiser,
come out with the package.

189
00:10:47,955 --> 00:10:49,421
Sounds simple enough.

190
00:10:49,423 --> 00:10:51,790
Nothing in this
business is simple.

191
00:10:51,792 --> 00:10:53,759
You know that,
Mr. Diggle.

192
00:10:53,761 --> 00:10:56,294
Follow me.

193
00:10:56,296 --> 00:10:58,230
I don't need you
to get the nerve agent out.

194
00:10:58,232 --> 00:11:00,265
I need you to get your team in.

195
00:11:00,267 --> 00:11:02,100
My team?

196
00:11:02,102 --> 00:11:05,570
They're designated
"Task Force X."

197
00:11:05,572 --> 00:11:08,140
Give me a break.

198
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:11,977
This ain't no task force.

199
00:11:11,979 --> 00:11:14,413
Let's call it like it is--

200
00:11:14,415 --> 00:11:18,650
Welcome
to the Suicide Squad.

201
00:11:25,773 --> 00:11:29,426
"It's not only prisoners
who grow course and hardened

202
00:11:29,427 --> 00:11:31,844
"from corporal punishment,
but those as well

203
00:11:31,845 --> 00:11:34,913
who perpetrate the act or who are
present to witness it."

204
00:11:34,915 --> 00:11:37,015
Oh, please stop
giving him books.

205
00:11:37,017 --> 00:11:38,650
So this
is your unit, huh, Waller?

206
00:11:38,652 --> 00:11:40,952
What, OJ and Charles Manson
weren't available?

207
00:11:40,954 --> 00:11:43,855
This is a dangerous operation.

208
00:11:43,857 --> 00:11:46,391
And these men
have useful skills.

209
00:11:46,393 --> 00:11:47,492
Should the mission be
compromised...

210
00:11:47,494 --> 00:11:49,727
You'll just
write them off.

211
00:11:49,729 --> 00:11:51,729
The Suicide Squad.

212
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:00,505
Yeah, like he would
ever make the sacrifice.

213
00:12:05,744 --> 00:12:08,746
Lyla, I can't believe
you're on board with this.

214
00:12:08,748 --> 00:12:10,014
Those men are murderers!

215
00:12:10,016 --> 00:12:11,416
And what's
the number of bodies

216
00:12:11,418 --> 00:12:13,084
between Oliver Queen
and Sara Lance?

217
00:12:13,086 --> 00:12:16,187
What they do, what I do,
is completely different.

218
00:12:16,189 --> 00:12:18,356
Not really, John.
Don't you see that?

219
00:12:18,358 --> 00:12:20,391
What I see is you letting
the man who killed my brother

220
00:12:20,393 --> 00:12:21,593
roam completely free.

221
00:12:21,595 --> 00:12:23,628
It's not freedom.
It's work.

222
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,829
It's wrong.

223
00:12:24,831 --> 00:12:26,297
Do you cuties
need some counseling?

224
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:28,733
I'm a trained therapist.

225
00:12:31,403 --> 00:12:34,572
"Do you have previous
experience in retail?"

226
00:12:34,574 --> 00:12:36,507
Does shopping count?

227
00:12:41,447 --> 00:12:42,714
Sara?

228
00:12:42,716 --> 00:12:44,916
I've seen that look before.

229
00:12:44,918 --> 00:12:47,952
On my face in the mirror when
Ollie goes into distant mode.

230
00:12:47,954 --> 00:12:49,787
Hang in there.

231
00:12:49,789 --> 00:12:51,422
He'll open up to you
when he's ready.

232
00:12:51,424 --> 00:12:54,292
Yeah.
You'd think so.

233
00:12:54,294 --> 00:12:58,196
I started by tracing the donation
Mr. Wilson made to Moira's campaign.

234
00:12:58,198 --> 00:13:00,932
All of the money was routed through
a series of offshore accounts.

235
00:13:00,934 --> 00:13:02,934
None of which link back
to a local address,

236
00:13:02,936 --> 00:13:05,069
so I looked into
credit card transactions

237
00:13:05,071 --> 00:13:07,805
and car rental agreements.
What?

238
00:13:07,807 --> 00:13:10,341
He's got to get around somehow,
just not by rental car.

239
00:13:10,343 --> 00:13:12,310
Slade's former ASIS.

240
00:13:12,312 --> 00:13:13,678
He knows how
to be a ghost.

241
00:13:15,649 --> 00:13:19,150
Robbery in progress.

242
00:13:19,152 --> 00:13:22,020
5th and Giffen.

243
00:13:22,022 --> 00:13:26,457
We're still in the crime fighting
business, right?

244
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:21,379
Harbinger has eyes
on the target.

245
00:14:21,381 --> 00:14:23,014
Light the torches.

246
00:14:23,016 --> 00:14:25,416
Deadshot is a go.

247
00:14:25,418 --> 00:14:27,352
Shrapnel's a go.

248
00:14:27,354 --> 00:14:29,420
Tiger's a go.

249
00:14:30,522 --> 00:14:31,856
This is Mockingbird.

250
00:14:31,858 --> 00:14:33,725
Harbinger,
you have a green light.

251
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,860
Freelancer, you're a go.
Deadshot?

252
00:14:35,862 --> 00:14:38,930
Got Freelancer
in my sights.

253
00:14:38,932 --> 00:14:41,532
What's stopping you
from shooting me right now?

254
00:14:41,534 --> 00:14:43,334
Honor.

255
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:49,640
Can I trouble you
for a cigarette, my friend?

256
00:14:49,642 --> 00:14:53,811
I don't smoke,
and I'm not your friend.

257
00:14:53,813 --> 00:14:55,913
You know who I am?

258
00:14:55,915 --> 00:14:58,616
What it is I do?

259
00:14:58,618 --> 00:15:02,286
You're dealing drugs,
weapons and children.

260
00:15:02,288 --> 00:15:05,189
Play both sides
of the conflict.

261
00:15:05,191 --> 00:15:08,159
Make money while
your country burns.

262
00:15:08,161 --> 00:15:10,862
I do not have
to be the only one.

263
00:15:10,864 --> 00:15:12,330
Let me go,
I make you rich.

264
00:15:12,332 --> 00:15:14,632
You trying to bribe
my men, Qadir?

265
00:15:14,634 --> 00:15:17,702
If we wanted to make a buck,
this is the last place we'd be, moron.

266
00:15:17,704 --> 00:15:19,637
Get down!

267
00:15:30,682 --> 00:15:33,051
Sorry, I wasn't
looking where I was--

268
00:15:33,053 --> 00:15:35,286
Gholem Qadir.

269
00:15:35,288 --> 00:15:38,122
I do know what is less likely--

270
00:15:38,124 --> 00:15:39,991
that John Diggle
would be clumsy,

271
00:15:39,993 --> 00:15:41,826
or I would find him here,
of all places.

272
00:15:41,828 --> 00:15:43,294
You like art, my friend?

273
00:15:43,296 --> 00:15:44,629
I know a good
investment when I see one.

274
00:15:44,631 --> 00:15:46,164
Out of the military, then?

275
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:47,999
And in a more
lucrative line of work.

276
00:15:48,001 --> 00:15:49,267
What kind of work is that?

277
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:51,169
The kind you don't
get to ask about.

278
00:15:51,171 --> 00:15:53,171
It's good seeing
you, Gholem.

279
00:15:53,173 --> 00:15:54,238
Everything all right
here, Mr. Diggle?

280
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,307
Yes, he's with me.

281
00:15:56,309 --> 00:16:00,912
So the soldier now has
his own security.

282
00:16:00,914 --> 00:16:03,915
In my line of work, when I do a
good job, I tend to make enemies.

283
00:16:03,917 --> 00:16:06,717
A good man turns bad.

284
00:16:06,719 --> 00:16:08,586
Bad man turns good.

285
00:16:08,588 --> 00:16:10,521
You changed my life, you know.

286
00:16:10,523 --> 00:16:12,190
Trust me, that was
never my intention.

287
00:16:12,192 --> 00:16:13,758
The intelligence
I provided your government,

288
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,393
it saved many lives.

289
00:16:15,395 --> 00:16:18,830
Now as a free man,
I give back when I can.

290
00:16:18,832 --> 00:16:20,364
Of course.

291
00:16:20,366 --> 00:16:22,934
Get down!

292
00:16:28,107 --> 00:16:30,241
It's all clear.

293
00:16:30,243 --> 00:16:32,043
Deja vu, my friend.

294
00:16:32,045 --> 00:16:33,277
Mr. Qadir!

295
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,812
I am fine.

296
00:16:34,814 --> 00:16:37,348
I do not believe
I was the target.

297
00:16:40,486 --> 00:16:42,920
Like I said, when I do my job right,
I tend to make enemies.

298
00:16:42,922 --> 00:16:45,656
We should go.

299
00:16:45,658 --> 00:16:49,827
Good job, Deadshot.
You're a go for exfil.

300
00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:51,896
Already in motion.

301
00:16:51,898 --> 00:16:54,065
Except, uh,

302
00:16:54,067 --> 00:16:55,733
I'm not the only one.

303
00:16:55,735 --> 00:16:58,102
Shrapnel just bolted.

304
00:16:58,104 --> 00:16:59,971
Find him.

305
00:16:59,973 --> 00:17:01,839
Picking him up,
headed east.

306
00:17:02,908 --> 00:17:04,876
Shrapnel.

307
00:17:04,878 --> 00:17:07,378
Stand down and return
to the rally point.

308
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,414
I won't be conscripted
into your moral army.

309
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:12,783
Stand down!
Final warning.

310
00:17:12,785 --> 00:17:15,286
Especially not while in a country
without an extradition treaty.

311
00:17:15,288 --> 00:17:16,487
Very well.

312
00:17:24,164 --> 00:17:26,797
What the hell's
going on?

313
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,833
Shrapnel just fouled
out of the game.

314
00:17:43,682 --> 00:17:45,182
What the hell
was that?

315
00:17:45,184 --> 00:17:46,783
We're going to want
popcorn for this.

316
00:17:46,785 --> 00:17:49,453
You said it yourself,
John. They're murderers.

317
00:17:49,455 --> 00:17:50,687
Criminals.

318
00:17:50,689 --> 00:17:53,657
They need an incentive
to follow orders.

319
00:17:53,659 --> 00:17:55,659
So you rigged
their heads with explosives?

320
00:17:55,661 --> 00:17:57,194
There's no danger as long
as they play by the rules.

321
00:17:57,196 --> 00:17:58,795
Scheffer didn't.

322
00:17:58,797 --> 00:18:00,831
It's like I don't
even know you anymore, Lyla.

323
00:18:03,234 --> 00:18:05,135
Where are we at with Qadir?

324
00:18:07,772 --> 00:18:11,475
Save a man's life once,
get a silver star.

325
00:18:11,477 --> 00:18:13,844
Save it twice?
Rent a tux.

326
00:18:13,846 --> 00:18:17,714
I'll await further
instructions, sir.

327
00:18:33,131 --> 00:18:36,199
Vashi lyudi
nezhnyye.

328
00:18:36,201 --> 00:18:38,502
So is my patience.

329
00:18:38,504 --> 00:18:41,905
This is Starling City
bank account number

330
00:18:41,907 --> 00:18:44,408
for your Mr. Wilson.

331
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:46,710
To be clear...

332
00:18:46,712 --> 00:18:49,846
Take this envelope
and we are through.

333
00:18:49,848 --> 00:18:52,249
I do not care
who your friends are.

334
00:18:52,251 --> 00:18:54,918
U nas yest' ponimaniye?

335
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:08,532
Relax, it's just me.

336
00:19:08,534 --> 00:19:10,067
What's going on, Ollie?

337
00:19:10,069 --> 00:19:11,601
Hey! Talk to me.

338
00:19:11,603 --> 00:19:13,203
Now is not the time.

339
00:19:13,205 --> 00:19:15,472
Then when is the time?

340
00:19:15,474 --> 00:19:18,041
The Bratva, Ollie?
You're losing your grip.

341
00:19:18,043 --> 00:19:20,077
Ok? Slade's getting
in your head.

342
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:21,378
I need this to stop.

343
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:24,047
And for it to stop,
I need to find him.

344
00:19:24,049 --> 00:19:25,849
Yeah, and until then,
how long do you think

345
00:19:25,851 --> 00:19:27,584
you can keep
this up for?

346
00:19:27,586 --> 00:19:29,352
You're not eating,
you're barely sleeping.

347
00:19:29,354 --> 00:19:32,656
And when you do,
you have nightmares.

348
00:19:32,658 --> 00:19:35,459
They're about her,
aren't they?

349
00:19:36,694 --> 00:19:38,962
Hey, look at me.

350
00:19:38,964 --> 00:19:40,697
You did what
you had to do, ok?

351
00:19:40,699 --> 00:19:43,300
Ivo was going to shoot Shado,
or me, or both of us.

352
00:19:43,302 --> 00:19:45,268
It was an
impossible choice.

353
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:47,671
I made it, anyway.

354
00:19:48,806 --> 00:19:50,941
But if you had
chosen differently,

355
00:19:50,943 --> 00:19:52,843
then it would be me
haunting you at night.

356
00:19:55,012 --> 00:19:58,849
It still could be, Sara.

357
00:19:58,851 --> 00:20:00,851
That's why we have to stop.

358
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:05,155
What are you saying?

359
00:20:05,157 --> 00:20:08,692
He's going to use you
to hurt me.

360
00:20:08,694 --> 00:20:11,461
Or he's going to hurt you...

361
00:20:18,636 --> 00:20:22,005
Stay away from me.

362
00:20:26,644 --> 00:20:28,292
Seeing as how you haven't
brought it up,

363
00:20:28,317 --> 00:20:29,780
I'm guessing you
haven't got very far

364
00:20:29,781 --> 00:20:31,515
with that H.I.V.E.
lead I gave you.

365
00:20:31,517 --> 00:20:33,183
Just make this quick.

366
00:20:35,154 --> 00:20:37,687
You're usually
so chatty, John.

367
00:20:37,689 --> 00:20:40,423
These problems with your girl,
they got you down, huh?

368
00:20:40,425 --> 00:20:42,392
And what about
your girl?

369
00:20:42,394 --> 00:20:45,862
The one you have
a shrine to in that cell of yours?

370
00:20:45,864 --> 00:20:47,998
Zoe.

371
00:20:49,967 --> 00:20:52,202
Does your daughter
know what you do for a living?

372
00:20:52,204 --> 00:20:53,670
She is why I do what I do.

373
00:20:53,672 --> 00:20:55,639
Really?
Yeah.

374
00:20:55,641 --> 00:20:58,375
How many enemies can
a little girl have?

375
00:20:58,377 --> 00:21:00,377
I wouldn't know.

376
00:21:00,379 --> 00:21:01,878
Everything I make
beyond expenses

377
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,681
goes in a blind trust.

378
00:21:11,322 --> 00:21:13,590
A girl needs
her father.

379
00:21:13,592 --> 00:21:15,559
Nah, not this father.

380
00:21:15,561 --> 00:21:18,028
Best thing I can do
for her life...

381
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,963
Not be in it.

382
00:21:24,169 --> 00:21:26,570
Is it ready?

383
00:21:26,572 --> 00:21:28,838
We're almost there.

384
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:34,110
You know, we went through all
that trouble to get Johnny here

385
00:21:34,112 --> 00:21:35,912
invited to this little shindig.

386
00:21:35,914 --> 00:21:38,348
Seems like an awful waste
not to use that invitation.

387
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,285
You're using it.

388
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:41,015
Once you have hands
on the nerve agent,

389
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,853
pocket it,
walk right on out.

390
00:21:43,855 --> 00:21:46,056
Copy that.

391
00:21:49,827 --> 00:21:53,897
Thank you very much.
Your generosity is much appreciated.

392
00:21:56,767 --> 00:21:59,703
That's not exactly
army camo.

393
00:21:59,705 --> 00:22:01,871
But have you given any thought to
what would happen

394
00:22:01,873 --> 00:22:03,773
if Qadir recognizes
you anyway?

395
00:22:03,775 --> 00:22:06,576
Mr. Diggle.
Who is this vision?

396
00:22:06,578 --> 00:22:09,145
His new bodyguard.

397
00:22:09,147 --> 00:22:12,082
Mmm. You will have to refer me
to your security company.

398
00:22:12,084 --> 00:22:14,417
I'm glad you could
come tonight.

399
00:22:14,419 --> 00:22:16,953
It's the least I could do after
you saved my life.

400
00:22:16,955 --> 00:22:18,622
Again.

401
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:21,157
I will see you
inside, my friend.

402
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:23,093
Gholem.

403
00:22:23,095 --> 00:22:25,061
It would seem
I didn't have time

404
00:22:25,063 --> 00:22:29,165
to get credentials
for my associate.

405
00:22:29,167 --> 00:22:32,636
Come. This way.

406
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:39,943
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

407
00:22:39,945 --> 00:22:41,645
I forgot those
were in there.

408
00:22:55,059 --> 00:22:58,061
Enjoy the benefit,
Mr. Diggle.

409
00:23:05,903 --> 00:23:08,171
Deadshot and his gear
are in position.

410
00:23:08,173 --> 00:23:09,939
Tiger's got
the overwatch.

411
00:23:09,941 --> 00:23:12,175
Harbinger to all,
fire in the hole.

412
00:23:18,649 --> 00:23:21,551
Shooter at my ten!

413
00:23:22,653 --> 00:23:26,056
I got you covered!

414
00:23:26,058 --> 00:23:27,390
Bounding!

415
00:23:41,405 --> 00:23:43,373
All clear!

416
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:04,627
It's just a kid.

417
00:24:17,354 --> 00:24:19,689
And don't you look
lovely tonight?

418
00:24:24,528 --> 00:24:28,231
Oh, I think you owe
your bodyguard a dance.

419
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:30,333
I insist.

420
00:24:41,745 --> 00:24:45,014
Deadshot en route
to package.

421
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:46,749
The fate of the world

422
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:49,519
resting in the hands
of Floyd Lawton.

423
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:52,422
It helps to focus
on the mission.

424
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:55,425
Is that what
you tell yourself?

425
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:57,760
I tell myself to see
the world how it is,

426
00:24:57,762 --> 00:24:59,262
not how I want to see it.

427
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:02,332
We both operate
in the grey.

428
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,367
The only difference
is, is I'm willing to admit it.

429
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:06,002
That's not the only
difference between us.

430
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:08,338
That's true.
I don't judge other people for it.

431
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,006
Lyla, I'm the same man
I've always been.

432
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,774
And I'm who
I've always been.

433
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:13,843
You're rigid, John.

434
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:16,713
You're blind to any viewpoint
that isn't yours.

435
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:19,282
These past few months
have been amazing.

436
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:20,984
But we've done more
playing than talking.

437
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:23,619
Because when we talk,
we tend to get divorced.

438
00:25:32,796 --> 00:25:35,064
Don't worry.

439
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:36,733
It's virgin.

440
00:25:38,569 --> 00:25:41,671
Ugh. Which is why
it tastes terrible.

441
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:44,240
True.

442
00:25:54,485 --> 00:25:56,352
So.

443
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:58,955
It looks like things with you
and Sara are going well.

444
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:01,657
I'm not sure
you're the best person

445
00:26:01,659 --> 00:26:03,893
to talk to with all this.
And why is that?

446
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:06,329
Is it because of the whole cheating,
shipwreck, drowning,

447
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:08,197
not drowning, you're
back, she's back thing?

448
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:09,465
Sorry.

449
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:11,934
It's brutal AA
honesty talking.

450
00:26:11,936 --> 00:26:13,836
I think I preferred it when
we were all lying to each other.

451
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:15,938
No, you just
thought you did.

452
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:18,875
I know you better
than almost anyone, Ollie.

453
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:20,943
I know that you think that you don't
deserve to be happy,

454
00:26:20,945 --> 00:26:22,712
but you're wrong.

455
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:24,647
You may think
that keeping her at arm's length,

456
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:26,682
you're protecting
her, but you're not.

457
00:26:26,684 --> 00:26:28,885
You're only
protecting yourself.

458
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:32,455
It's more complicated than that.

459
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:35,425
It always is.

460
00:26:43,167 --> 00:26:47,470
I got the address for that account
number you gave me.

461
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:49,172
I'll call Roy and Sara.

462
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:53,443
No. I'm not giving Slade
any more targets.

463
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:57,346
You can't go out
there by yourself, it's suicide.

464
00:26:57,348 --> 00:26:59,849
This started
with the two of us.

465
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:02,318
That's how it ends.

466
00:27:08,525 --> 00:27:11,027
Deadshot's on target.

467
00:27:16,033 --> 00:27:19,035
Bingo.

468
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,754
I don't know what to do.

469
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:48,291
He's too far ahead.

470
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:50,426
I mean, he spent years
planning this,

471
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:53,262
and he knows
everything about me.

472
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:55,698
I can't, I...

473
00:28:59,269 --> 00:29:03,539
I don't know
how to stop him.

474
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:06,876
Well, you start
by letting people help you.

475
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:10,012
But he's going
to come after you.

476
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:13,749
You're alive...

477
00:29:13,751 --> 00:29:16,752
Because Shado isn't.

478
00:29:16,754 --> 00:29:19,355
And when he does,
do you think it'll make a difference

479
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:20,957
whether or not
we're together?

480
00:29:29,466 --> 00:29:31,968
Let him come.

481
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:34,570
I'm not the girl he
knew on the island.

482
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:38,241
I'm not that easy
to kill.

483
00:29:41,645 --> 00:29:44,347
Together?

484
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:52,054
Together.

485
00:29:57,461 --> 00:29:59,962
I'm in.

486
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:03,933
I'll have the nerve agent
in my pocket in 30 seconds.

487
00:30:17,614 --> 00:30:20,583
Harbinger...

488
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:25,488
We've got what I would describe
as a little bit of a situation here.

489
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,722
Explain.

490
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:28,090
Well, I got eyes
on the nerve agent,

491
00:30:28,092 --> 00:30:29,825
and I'm not going to be
able to move it,

492
00:30:29,827 --> 00:30:31,394
much less pocket it.

493
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:34,397
Stand by, Deadshot.
I need to talk to Waller.

494
00:30:35,265 --> 00:30:37,566
Go for Mockingbird.

495
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:39,902
We have a situation.
The package is much bigger

496
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:41,504
than our pre-op briefing
indicated.

497
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,306
Stand by.

498
00:30:45,175 --> 00:30:48,611
Deadshot's on target; I need
to see what he does.

499
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:50,746
Activate the camera
in his eye piece.

500
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:52,515
Multi spectrum
from Lawton's rig

501
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,016
coming in...now.

502
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,751
It's a match.

503
00:30:57,921 --> 00:30:59,789
Tiger, move
for extraction.

504
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,490
Deadshot,
remain in position.

505
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:04,060
Harbinger and Freelancer, evac
and head to the rally point.

506
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:06,629
Deadshot still isn't
topside with the package.

507
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:09,632
I only needed eyes on.
Fall back to the rally point.

508
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:11,567
Wait...You knew
that the nerve agent

509
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:13,269
was too large
to be extracted?

510
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:16,339
Fall back
to the rally point.

511
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:18,674
Nine is inbound
and hot.

512
00:31:18,676 --> 00:31:21,243
Mockingbird out.

513
00:31:21,245 --> 00:31:22,678
What the hell
are nines?

514
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,780
MQ-9s. Predators.

515
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:27,683
Waller's called in
a drone strike.

516
00:31:27,685 --> 00:31:30,953
Everyone here is dead
inside of ten minutes.

517
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:46,104
The nines carry
the Hellfire missile.

518
00:31:46,106 --> 00:31:48,039
Just one of them
can level this whole building.

519
00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:49,841
And your boss doesn't care
who's here when it does.

520
00:31:49,843 --> 00:31:51,509
Lyla, we have to get
these people out of here.

521
00:31:51,511 --> 00:31:54,946
Maybe there's a house alarm
we can trigger.

522
00:31:54,948 --> 00:31:58,850
John, we have
to move now.

523
00:31:58,852 --> 00:32:00,685
I have a better idea.

524
00:32:03,355 --> 00:32:05,590
Excuse me.

525
00:32:05,592 --> 00:32:06,891
Excuse me.

526
00:32:06,893 --> 00:32:08,827
Can I have your
attention, please?

527
00:32:11,565 --> 00:32:14,399
In honor of our host.

528
00:32:15,801 --> 00:32:18,703
Gholem Qadir excels at everything
he puts his mind to,

529
00:32:18,705 --> 00:32:20,872
be it business,

530
00:32:20,874 --> 00:32:23,074
philanthropy...

531
00:32:23,076 --> 00:32:26,678
or terrorism.

532
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:30,248
Yeah, I guess you could say Gholem
is somewhat of a renaissance man.

533
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:32,450
He dabbles in a little
bit of everything.

534
00:32:32,452 --> 00:32:35,420
Arms trading--
did I mention the sex trafficking?

535
00:32:35,422 --> 00:32:39,190
Or the deadly nerve
agent that he's holding

536
00:32:39,192 --> 00:32:42,861
just 30 feet beneath
this very dance floor.

537
00:32:42,863 --> 00:32:44,896
These are lies!
This man is a mercenary!

538
00:32:44,898 --> 00:32:47,999
Lawton!

539
00:32:48,001 --> 00:32:50,668
He's not answering.
I have to go help him.

540
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:52,370
I can't believe
I just said that.

541
00:32:52,372 --> 00:32:55,907
You! You were
in Afghanistan five years ago.

542
00:32:55,909 --> 00:32:59,544
You and that Judas have been deceiving
me from the start.

543
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:04,382
Good timing.

544
00:33:04,384 --> 00:33:06,150
Got tired of waiting
for my invitation.

545
00:33:12,392 --> 00:33:16,227
Tsk, tsk.
Disobeying orders, John.

546
00:33:16,229 --> 00:33:18,563
Behind you.

547
00:33:23,402 --> 00:33:25,436
That's two
you owe me, junior.

548
00:33:25,438 --> 00:33:28,039
We have to go.

549
00:33:28,041 --> 00:33:29,440
Waller told me
to stay here.

550
00:33:29,442 --> 00:33:31,109
There's an incoming
drone strike.

551
00:33:31,111 --> 00:33:34,312
How contemporary.
Get your team clear.

552
00:33:35,614 --> 00:33:37,515
You are on my team.

553
00:33:37,517 --> 00:33:39,017
And it's time for you to go.

554
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:41,219
Yeah, that's right.
It is time.

555
00:33:41,221 --> 00:33:43,788
And this
is my way to go.

556
00:33:46,425 --> 00:33:47,992
Suicide Squad,
remember?

557
00:33:47,994 --> 00:33:50,395
I'm expendable,
John.

558
00:33:50,397 --> 00:33:53,932
Even got the damn bomb
in my head to prove it.

559
00:33:53,934 --> 00:33:57,568
This way, at least I get to go out
doing something honorable.

560
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:58,937
You don't get to die
that easy, Lawton.

561
00:33:58,939 --> 00:34:00,004
Really?

562
00:34:00,006 --> 00:34:01,506
Why don't you give
me even just

563
00:34:01,508 --> 00:34:04,042
one good reason
why not, huh?

564
00:34:04,044 --> 00:34:06,811
Zoe.

565
00:34:15,888 --> 00:34:18,423
What about the nerve gas?
Believe me--

566
00:34:18,425 --> 00:34:21,459
Waller's already
got that covered.

567
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:32,337
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

568
00:34:43,682 --> 00:34:46,851
The drone shifted course.
It's following us.

569
00:34:49,322 --> 00:34:50,355
Do you find that funny?

570
00:34:50,357 --> 00:34:52,290
The wall.
What a woman.

571
00:34:52,292 --> 00:34:54,859
How do you think she knew where
to send the drone, huh?

572
00:34:54,861 --> 00:34:57,395
And I mean,
the precise coordinates.

573
00:34:57,397 --> 00:35:00,031
The implants.
Bomb and GPS.

574
00:35:00,033 --> 00:35:01,833
Pretty clever,
right? The drone

575
00:35:01,835 --> 00:35:04,402
ain't targeting
Gholem's house.

576
00:35:04,404 --> 00:35:06,804
It's targeting me.

577
00:35:12,244 --> 00:35:14,145
Whoa, hang on, do I
get a say in this?

578
00:35:14,147 --> 00:35:15,480
Turn around.
What are you doing?

579
00:35:15,482 --> 00:35:17,482
Look, I think
I'd rather get blown up!

580
00:35:17,484 --> 00:35:19,517
Hold still.
This is going to hurt.

581
00:35:49,852 --> 00:35:53,003
The Markovian government
is threatening retaliation

582
00:35:53,004 --> 00:35:56,506
following an unprovoked
drone attack over a no-fly zone.

583
00:35:56,508 --> 00:36:00,143
Just the attention we wanted
to avoid. Well done.

584
00:36:00,145 --> 00:36:01,845
I'm not the one
who sent that drone.

585
00:36:01,847 --> 00:36:04,747
It was cloaked.
An explosion atop

586
00:36:04,749 --> 00:36:06,783
a chemical weapons cache
is easy to explain.

587
00:36:06,785 --> 00:36:08,151
Instead, there were
witnesses and we had

588
00:36:08,153 --> 00:36:10,587
to send in a SEAL team
to clean out the estate.

589
00:36:10,589 --> 00:36:12,155
I guess you'll think
twice before dragging me

590
00:36:12,157 --> 00:36:13,790
in to do your dirty
work, Waller.

591
00:36:13,792 --> 00:36:15,125
Somehow I don't think
it will be an issue.

592
00:36:15,127 --> 00:36:17,127
Good day, Mr. Diggle.

593
00:36:27,372 --> 00:36:29,806
Kind of uncanny.

594
00:36:29,808 --> 00:36:33,343
How Diggle knew exactly
where Lawton's implant was.

595
00:36:33,345 --> 00:36:35,011
Still,

596
00:36:35,013 --> 00:36:38,081
it exposed an obvious
design flaw.

597
00:36:38,083 --> 00:36:41,584
We'll be putting in the implants
in their spinal vertebrae now.

598
00:36:41,586 --> 00:36:43,987
Have Lawton and the others
prepped for surgery.

599
00:36:54,999 --> 00:36:59,235
Waller said in a few years,
you might even get a pardon.

600
00:36:59,237 --> 00:37:01,604
Don't worry, John.

601
00:37:01,606 --> 00:37:04,541
We both know I'm not
going to be around that long.

602
00:37:22,927 --> 00:37:24,627
You still employed?

603
00:37:24,629 --> 00:37:26,529
People with my security clearance
aren't that easy

604
00:37:26,531 --> 00:37:28,932
to get rid of.
Right.

605
00:37:32,236 --> 00:37:35,004
What about us, Johnny?

606
00:37:35,006 --> 00:37:38,208
Last night, the man who
killed my brother

607
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:40,410
showed more character than
the woman charged

608
00:37:40,412 --> 00:37:42,512
with protecting
the world.

609
00:37:44,716 --> 00:37:47,383
Good and bad is not
so clear to me.

610
00:37:48,886 --> 00:37:51,254
One thing
I do know for sure,

611
00:37:51,256 --> 00:37:54,424
black and white...

612
00:37:54,426 --> 00:37:58,261
Is that I can't ever
lose you again.

613
00:37:58,263 --> 00:38:01,531
Finally.

614
00:38:01,533 --> 00:38:04,500
Something we agree on.

615
00:38:20,551 --> 00:38:24,654
Well, there goes another
terrorist-turned-ally.

616
00:38:24,656 --> 00:38:27,189
By the way, I put you in
for a commendation

617
00:38:27,191 --> 00:38:28,891
for saving Qadir's ass.

618
00:38:28,893 --> 00:38:32,194
You owe me a beer.

619
00:38:38,435 --> 00:38:40,102
Congratulations.

620
00:38:40,104 --> 00:38:42,738
Yeah, well, kill a kid,
get a medal, right?

621
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:45,207
When someone's shooting
a Kalishnikov at you,

622
00:38:45,209 --> 00:38:47,710
he's not a kid.

623
00:38:47,712 --> 00:38:50,212
I see things
differently.

624
00:38:50,214 --> 00:38:53,115
It's a complicated world,
Johnny.

625
00:38:53,117 --> 00:38:55,117
Is it ok if I call you Johnny?

626
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:58,220
I don't think I caught your first
name, Michaels.

627
00:38:58,222 --> 00:39:00,590
Lyla.

628
00:39:00,592 --> 00:39:03,025
It's really good
to meet you, Lyla.

629
00:39:06,563 --> 00:39:09,365
In international news,
a United Nations inspections team

630
00:39:09,367 --> 00:39:13,102
was called to a chemical weapons
manufacturing facility

631
00:39:13,104 --> 00:39:15,071
hidden beneath
the Markovian estate

632
00:39:15,073 --> 00:39:17,106
of humanitarian
Gholem Qadir.

633
00:39:17,108 --> 00:39:19,375
Closer to home, mayoral
candidate Moira Queen

634
00:39:19,377 --> 00:39:21,611
stumped
for an initiative

635
00:39:21,613 --> 00:39:24,981
to revive inner city
after school swim programs.

636
00:39:24,983 --> 00:39:26,282
Oh, I remember how
much my children

637
00:39:26,284 --> 00:39:27,984
enjoyed swimming
when they were young.

638
00:39:27,986 --> 00:39:30,119
I couldn't get them out
of the pool.

639
00:39:30,121 --> 00:39:32,088
We need--

640
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:34,790
I thought
you hated swimming.

641
00:39:34,792 --> 00:39:36,525
I detest swimming.

642
00:39:36,527 --> 00:39:39,362
So does Thea.

643
00:39:39,364 --> 00:39:41,297
My mother sometimes--ahem--

644
00:39:41,299 --> 00:39:44,266
enjoys a casual relationship
with the truth.

645
00:39:45,335 --> 00:39:48,004
Anyway.

646
00:39:57,782 --> 00:40:00,483
Thank you
for being there for me.

647
00:40:00,485 --> 00:40:02,551
You mean for not
letting you push me away?

648
00:40:02,553 --> 00:40:05,454
I'm going to stop doing that.

649
00:40:05,456 --> 00:40:07,657
Yeah? Good.

650
00:40:07,659 --> 00:40:10,793
You'll be wasting
your time, anyways.

651
00:40:23,306 --> 00:40:26,075
It looks like
you took my advice.

652
00:40:26,077 --> 00:40:29,645
Thank you.

653
00:40:29,647 --> 00:40:31,313
Helping me
with Sara,

654
00:40:31,315 --> 00:40:34,350
I know that that...
can't be easy.

655
00:40:34,352 --> 00:40:35,818
Helping two people
I care about?

656
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,319
There's nothing easier.

657
00:40:37,321 --> 00:40:39,989
I came by to take Sara
to dinner.

658
00:40:39,991 --> 00:40:41,991
Would you care to join?

659
00:40:41,993 --> 00:40:44,994
I'd love to, but I need
to go see an old friend.

660
00:40:44,996 --> 00:40:47,063
Ok.

661
00:41:06,149 --> 00:41:08,517
Hello, Oliver.

662
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:11,153
Hello, Amanda.

663
00:41:11,155 --> 00:41:14,156
Still mad at me?
Lucky for you,

664
00:41:14,158 --> 00:41:15,524
you've been pushed
down that list.

665
00:41:15,526 --> 00:41:18,294
Really? Who do you want
to kill more than me?

666
00:41:18,296 --> 00:41:20,262
Slade Wilson is alive.

667
00:41:20,264 --> 00:41:21,964
You killed him.

668
00:41:21,966 --> 00:41:24,133
It's not possible.

669
00:41:24,135 --> 00:41:26,168
Everything is possible
where Slade is concerned.

670
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:29,472
And I need
your help to find him.

671
00:41:30,907 --> 00:41:34,143
I might have something.
What?

672
00:41:34,145 --> 00:41:35,902
There's a new player
we've been tracking--

673
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:37,047
mercenary.

674
00:41:37,048 --> 00:41:39,248
He's left a trail of bodies

675
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:41,817
from Macau
to Istanbul to Lisbon.

676
00:41:41,819 --> 00:41:44,420
A trail that leads
right here to Starling.

677
00:41:48,191 --> 00:41:52,695
We've been
calling him Deathstroke.
