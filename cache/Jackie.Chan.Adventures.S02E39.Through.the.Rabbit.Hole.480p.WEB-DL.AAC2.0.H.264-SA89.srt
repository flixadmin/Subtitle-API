1
00:00:01,568 --> 00:00:04,570
Please, Jackie?
I need it for school.

2
00:00:04,572 --> 00:00:05,838
Mm-mmm.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,906
Nobody believes me
about the talismans,

4
00:00:07,908 --> 00:00:10,175
but if I show them some
super-rabbit speed...

5
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:16,915
A talisman
is not a toy, Jade.

6
00:00:16,917 --> 00:00:19,018
Come on, Jackie.
You were a kid once.

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,787
Didn't you ever want to be
the big chan on campus?

8
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:23,689
Yes, I did.

9
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:26,759
And this is the scar
I have to show for it.

10
00:00:26,761 --> 00:00:29,428
I don't want you
getting hurt, too.

11
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,596
So no showing off.

12
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:35,401
But as long
as I don't show off,

13
00:00:35,403 --> 00:00:38,070
I can still
borrow it, right?

14
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:40,839
See you
after school. Bye!

15
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:44,410
Jackie'll never even
notice it's--

16
00:00:44,412 --> 00:00:46,211
Jackie: Jade? Jade!

17
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:50,516
Whah!

18
00:00:50,518 --> 00:00:53,352
Jade, did you just
- intercept my chronoton beam?

19
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:55,888
Me, kepler?

20
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,956
No.

21
00:00:57,958 --> 00:01:00,726
Can't have you disrupting
the time continuum.

22
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:02,027
Heh heh.

23
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:05,864
Baah!
- There you are.

24
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:07,299
You forgot your lunch.

25
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:09,802
Heh! Thanks.

26
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:14,807
Whew! And she's safe.

27
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,136
Ah! I wish
we hadn't lost
that speed talisman.

28
00:02:17,138 --> 00:02:19,138
I wish chan
was never born.

29
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,506
I wish one of them
talismans

30
00:02:20,508 --> 00:02:22,341
would come to us
for a change.

31
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,112
¶ Boom chicka-chicka
boom-boom chicka-chicka ¶

32
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:28,514
¶ boom uhh ¶

33
00:02:28,516 --> 00:02:30,582
I wish I had
a million bucks.

34
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:38,123
¶ Boom chicka-chicka ¶

35
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,892
¶ boom-boom
chicka-chicka boom ¶

36
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:44,196
(gasps)
I'm late!

37
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:50,802
(All grumble)

38
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:53,071
Sparks? Since when
are there...

39
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,377
Whoa.

40
00:02:58,379 --> 00:02:59,978
Aaaaaaaah!

41
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,214
Uhh!

42
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:03,949
Ok...

43
00:03:03,951 --> 00:03:05,450
That was weird.

44
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,357
Hey, miss hartman,
sorry I'm--

45
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:17,062
ha ha ha ha ha!

46
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:18,997
<i>What</i> are you
wearing?

47
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:20,165
Ahem.

48
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:22,734
Are you in the right
classroom, young lady?

49
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:24,636
Miss hartman,
it's me.

50
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:26,738
Jade chan. Nice do.

51
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,742
Chan. Of course.

52
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:34,479
Class, Jade
is the new student
we've been expecting.

53
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:35,747
I am?

54
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:38,517
Now, let's start
with current events.

55
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:40,786
Who watched
president Carter's
speech on TV--

56
00:03:40,788 --> 00:03:42,821
new student?
Bell-bottoms?

57
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:43,989
President who?

58
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:45,924
What is going--
(Gasps)

59
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:48,026
1976?

60
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:51,863
I'm not late for class.
I'm early. Way early.

61
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:53,198
I'm sorry I'm late.

62
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,001
I'm your new student,
Jackie chan.

63
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,537
No way.

64
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:00,072
Another chan?

65
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:02,207
Are you two related?

66
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:05,744
B-b-b-bathroom.

67
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:07,946
What did you do?

68
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:09,481
You're the speed talisman,

69
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:12,284
not the talisman-
that-sends-you-back-
in-time talisman.

70
00:04:12,286 --> 00:04:13,919
The beam.

71
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:17,723
Kepler said I was messing
with the time something-uum.

72
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:21,059
Well, whatever you did,
I'm gonna reverse it, fast.

73
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,364
Hmm?

74
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:28,467
Rrrrr!

75
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,203
Come oooooon!

76
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:34,239
Pet rocks,
mood rings.

77
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:36,174
Get 'em while
they're now, baby.

78
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:39,011
Ohh...I'm stuck
in the seventies.

79
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:43,615
So, she speeds off,
and then, zappo--
she's gone.

80
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,050
It was freaky, big v,

81
00:04:45,052 --> 00:04:47,319
left behind some kind
of energy hole.

82
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:50,455
Energy hole? Zappo?

83
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:53,358
A crude description,
valmont.

84
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,361
But I indeed sense
a wrinkle in time.

85
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:58,864
The child has used
the speed talisman

86
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:01,600
to forge a tunnel
to the past.

87
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:04,069
And if shendu's rabbit
dug a hole,

88
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:07,406
all you idiots
have to do to secure
the talisman

89
00:05:07,408 --> 00:05:10,008
is go through that hole.

90
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:13,779
But tunnels through time
flow only in one direction.

91
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:16,048
If you wish them
to return,

92
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,150
they will require this.

93
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:25,157
So, uh, just
how far back does this
tunnel thingy go?

94
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:26,892
We talking
dinosaurs?

95
00:05:26,894 --> 00:05:30,762
I don't care if it
leads to the big bang,
you buffoons!

96
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:33,165
Just bring me
that talisman.

97
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:39,004
(Telephone rings)
Hello?

98
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:42,207
Jackie, you are
a terrible guardian!

99
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:43,275
Uncle?

100
00:05:43,277 --> 00:05:44,676
Jade's teacher phoned.

101
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,211
She is skipping
school.

102
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:48,814
One more thing:
These kinds of things

103
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:51,717
never happened
when I was raising you!

104
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:53,318
They certainly didn't.

105
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:56,655
Kepler, have you
seen Jade--aah!

106
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,958
Same beam
almost fried Jade.

107
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,027
Maybe I should
move the emitter.

108
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:05,430
Uhh! Maybe?
This is a safety hazard!

109
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:07,599
My chronoton beam
is not a hazard.

110
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:09,368
If anyone
were to be exposed,

111
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,870
this scanner
would reveal...

112
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,939
A trail
of particles...

113
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:16,475
Leading out
of the lab.

114
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,577
And straight to Jade.

115
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:23,782
Bell-bottoms. Uck!

116
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:25,384
That's so nineties!

117
00:06:25,386 --> 00:06:27,586
I got to find
a way home, fast!

118
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:28,653
Can not!

119
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:29,855
Can so!

120
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:32,424
Can not. Nobody
can jump this fence.

121
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:34,025
It's too tall.

122
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:36,128
I can. Watch.

123
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,032
Hyuh...Aah--
- gotcha!

124
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:42,434
Whoa! Ohh!

125
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:45,537
Where did you
come from?

126
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:46,905
Ha ha!

127
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,673
Evel knievel
wannabe.

128
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:50,675
Both: Ha ha ha ha ha!

129
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:52,477
You ok?

130
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,646
Didn't hurt
yourself, did you?

131
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:56,715
I'm just
very embarrassed.

132
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:01,887
My scar...

133
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:04,055
What scar?

134
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:05,357
Exactly.

135
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:10,429
I really will
be able to jump
that fence someday.

136
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:11,930
Oh, I believe you.

137
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,231
I'm learning kung fu.

138
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:14,800
My parents sent me
to America

139
00:07:14,802 --> 00:07:16,435
so I can train
with my uncle.

140
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:19,271
Uncle! Why didn't
I think of that?

141
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:20,806
Whoa!
- Come on!

142
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:23,809
I don't know
about this.

143
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:24,976
Enter.

144
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:27,312
No way! There could be
raptors or t-rexes.

145
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:30,215
I'm not your
Guinea piiiii--

146
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:31,716
if there are dinosaurs,

147
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:34,019
they will be busy
eating Finn.

148
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:35,454
Whoa!

149
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:36,655
(All shout)

150
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:37,956
Ow! Oof!

151
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:41,626
Finn: Get down.

152
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,028
Get funky.

153
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:46,898
It's the seventies.

154
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:50,769
The talisman is near.

155
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:56,541
(Gasps)

156
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,745
How did you know
where I live?

157
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:02,681
Whoa! What are these?

158
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:06,918
8-track tapes.

159
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,820
But where
are the antiques?

160
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:12,057
While I wish to trade
in ancient treasures,

161
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:15,060
8-track is the wave
of the future.

162
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:16,862
How did you know
about antiques?

163
00:08:16,864 --> 00:08:18,864
Because I'm Jade chan,
your niece,

164
00:08:18,866 --> 00:08:21,032
and I need your expert
magic advice!

165
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,634
Magic?

166
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:25,270
Oh...Guess you don't
study with chi master fong

167
00:08:25,272 --> 00:08:26,872
for another few years.

168
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,675
The talisman.

169
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:34,713
Shouldn't
you guys be, like,
9 years old?

170
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:36,381
Jackie, go to your room.

171
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:39,951
Whoa. It's chan,
but bite-size.

172
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:42,387
And if we off him
when he's little...

173
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:44,022
He'll never
get big.

174
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:46,124
Destroy him.

175
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:47,225
(Gasps)

176
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:48,527
Bad day.

177
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,235
All: Rrrah!

178
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:01,706
Hyuh!

179
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:02,774
Ahh...Hyuh!

180
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:04,276
Hyoo-wuh!

181
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:06,077
Huhh!

182
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:08,880
Whoa. Jackie gets it
all from uncle.

183
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,016
Of course I do.
He trains me.

184
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:12,651
Hyah-ha! Whoa.

185
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:14,352
Run!

186
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:15,754
Wah...Haa!

187
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:19,024
You will pay for that!

188
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,896
All: Ow! Oh! Ow! Ooh! Hey!

189
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:36,141
What's that?

190
00:09:36,143 --> 00:09:37,442
My lucky rabbit's foot.

191
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,544
The talisman.

192
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,115
Sorry.
We'll bring them back.
Thank you!

193
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:47,786
What are you
doing--aah!

194
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,855
Jackie: Bwaaah!

195
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,358
(All sigh)

196
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,094
What are we
gonna do?

197
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,629
If we go back
empty-handed,

198
00:09:57,631 --> 00:09:59,331
valmont's
gonna freak.

199
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,833
Ooh! Valmont!
He'd know what to do.

200
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:03,935
Let's find him
and ask him.

201
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,739
Earth to ratso.
It's 1976.

202
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:09,941
Valmont is a kid,
a British kid.

203
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,210
He's not gonna be
in San Francisco.

204
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:13,511
Bingo.

205
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,584
What do <i> you</i> buffoons want?

206
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:23,622
Wow. That's him,
all right.

207
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:25,757
What are you doing
in America?

208
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:28,126
(Scoffs)
I'm an exchange
student,

209
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,427
and I won't
be harassed

210
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:31,229
by American
salesmen.

211
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:32,364
Who sent you people?

212
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:34,499
Uh, you did.

213
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:36,334
See, it's like this,
little v.

214
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:39,571
We're not salesmen.
We're from the future.

215
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,642
Impossible.

216
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:45,477
My particles couldn't
make a wormhole

217
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:48,279
unless Jade was moving
at unthinkable speed.

218
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:51,149
But this
is definitely a bridge
in the time continuum.

219
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,917
Jade's either
in the future,
or she's...

220
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,552
In the past!

221
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:57,422
My scar! Oh, Jade's
changing the past,

222
00:10:57,424 --> 00:10:58,657
my past!

223
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,226
Careful. One-way trip.

224
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:03,328
But if Jade's
in the past,

225
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,031
the future could be
in big trouble.

226
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:11,169
Slow down!
Please, slow down!

227
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:18,843
Think we ditched 'em.

228
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,679
Ditched who?
Why are those men after me?

229
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:23,048
What's that rabbit thing?
How can you run so fast?

230
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,349
What's going on?

231
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:25,850
Ok. Here's the deal.

232
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:28,019
I'm from the future.
You're my uncle.

233
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,088
The talisman's magic.
The dark hand
is after it.

234
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,090
And now they want
to get rid of you

235
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:34,125
so they won't
have to fight you
when you grow up.

236
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:35,427
Get it?

237
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:36,561
That's crazy, Jade.

238
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:38,697
You're crazy.

239
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:41,666
Do I really grow up
to be a criminal
mastermind?

240
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:43,034
Uh-huh.

241
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,003
Well, then, I say
we kidnap the old man

242
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:48,573
and use a ransom note
to lure this chan
into an ambush.

243
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:51,943
Uh, that's the plan
you used the first time
we met chan.

244
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:53,878
And it didn't
work then.

245
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,581
Then might I suggest
you leave him...

246
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,183
To me.

247
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,690
Sir! Come quickly!
Your nephew needs help!

248
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:06,758
Jackie?

249
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:08,827
Where is he?

250
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,862
Uhh...Ohh...

251
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:15,066
My first act
of mega-villainy.

252
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,634
This is exhilarating.

253
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,272
Coast is clear.
Come on.

254
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:22,841
Uncle's probably
worried sick.

255
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:29,714
Jackie: Hello?
Uncle? Hello?

256
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,252
(Gasps)
The dark hand's
got uncle!

257
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,453
We have
to rescue him.

258
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,688
<i>I</i> have to rescue him.

259
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:37,922
If they get
their hands on you,

260
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,224
it'll mess up the future.

261
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,129
And if uncle is harmed,
it will mess up my future.

262
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:51,669
Jade! Jade?

263
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:55,206
Oh! The dark hand's
got uncle!

264
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,109
What are they doing here?

265
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:01,012
Mmm...Mmm...Mmm...

266
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:02,147
Mmm...

267
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:04,149
So, uh, what if
your host parents

268
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:05,383
come home,
little big v?

269
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:06,951
I will simply
assure them

270
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,286
this is all
part of some
sort of

271
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:10,288
social studies
project
for school.

272
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:17,061
Hey!

273
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:18,196
Ooh!

274
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:21,399
Hwuh! Uhh!

275
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:28,406
Argh!
Gah!
- Eeg!

276
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:31,209
Unh! Uhh!

277
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:32,477
Raarrr!

278
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,380
Mmm-mmm!

279
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:41,019
Whoa!

280
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,024
Bah-hah!

281
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:47,091
Whew!

282
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:49,394
What's with
the crystal ball?

283
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:52,697
I'm coming, uncle!

284
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:53,765
Jade: Jackie!

285
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:54,866
Ohh!

286
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:57,001
Ready to rewrite
history, little chan?

287
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,469
Noooooooo....

288
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:07,078
(Blubbers)
Help! Help!

289
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,147
Jackie hasn't learned
how to swim yet?

290
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:10,381
Hang on, Jack--

291
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:11,449
the talisman.

292
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:12,884
Unh! Let go!

293
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:14,719
(Chokes, sputters)

294
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:16,221
(Pants)

295
00:14:16,223 --> 00:14:17,555
Oh! Oh...

296
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:20,225
Bad day.

297
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,933
(Chokes)

298
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:30,034
(Choking)

299
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,970
Oh! Let me go! Uhh!

300
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:33,805
Hand over
the talisman.

301
00:14:33,807 --> 00:14:35,039
Fetch!

302
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,114
Jackie! Say something!

303
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,149
(Coughs)

304
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:46,217
(Gasps)

305
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,418
That'll do.

306
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:51,189
How come no one
invited me...

307
00:14:51,191 --> 00:14:52,857
To the pool party?

308
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:56,127
How 'bout
we just go home

309
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:57,195
with the talisman?

310
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,166
Valmont:
You can't leave me!

311
00:15:02,168 --> 00:15:03,902
I'm your boss!

312
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:05,370
You got to be
kidding me.

313
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,775
The talisman.
It's magic.

314
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:12,510
Uh-huh. Give me
a hand, Jackie.

315
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:14,078
Coming.
- Coming.

316
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:16,114
Aah!
- Aah!

317
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:18,483
Bah!
- Bah!

318
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:26,291
Are you...
Are you...

319
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:28,960
You are!
You are!

320
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:30,528
I have to break up
the lovefest,

321
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,297
but the bad guys said
they're going home!

322
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:34,198
Which means
they can go home.

323
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,167
Must be that
crystal ball thing.

324
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:38,536
You mean this?

325
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:40,371
I took it from the man
who grabbed me.

326
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,477
I'm telling you,
I didn't lose it!

327
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,151
Lose what, you buffoons?

328
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:54,585
Jade: This.

329
00:15:57,222 --> 00:15:58,489
Rrrrrr!

330
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:02,360
Ooh-hoo!

331
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:04,729
Ooh.

332
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:07,165
(Kids chatter)

333
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:15,907
Give me that!

334
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:17,842
Hyah-gaah!

335
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,780
Everybody
- is kung fu fighting.

336
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:24,382
Hyuh!

337
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:27,151
Hyuh! Uhh! Uhh!

338
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:06,691
(Kids cheer)

339
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:09,093
¶ I got
the boogie fever ¶

340
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:10,395
¶ uh, uh ¶

341
00:17:10,397 --> 00:17:12,030
¶ I got the fever ¶

342
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:14,265
¶ I, uh, got the fever ¶

343
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:16,134
(kids cheer)

344
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:22,006
Where'd tohru go
with the--

345
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:24,675
(gasps)
Jackie!

346
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:28,646
I can see the future.

347
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:32,383
Huh?

348
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,357
Wet willies!

349
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:40,558
Ooh!

350
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:43,394
Big me, catch!

351
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:46,064
Tohru: Chan!

352
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,365
Get off me!

353
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:50,168
The crystal, or you'll have
an unhappy childhood.

354
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,605
Let him go,
or he will, too!

355
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:56,174
Do as he says.
Please.

356
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:06,784
Hold it.
Chan wouldn't hurt a kid,

357
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:08,519
not even mini-valmont.

358
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:12,490
Ohh...

359
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:13,925
Jackie
wouldn't...

360
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:15,393
But I would!

361
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:19,063
Do it,
and no one leaves.

362
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:21,799
No!

363
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,107
(Gasps)

364
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:30,274
Wait!

365
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:34,345
Uh-oh.

366
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:35,780
We'll be stranded!

367
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:37,849
(Kids cheer)

368
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:41,686
But I don't want
to go back! I don't
want to go back!

369
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:46,457
You may have won
today, chan.

370
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,559
But we will
meet again, and--

371
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:49,794
hyah!

372
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:50,862
Aah!

373
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:54,365
Jackie, it looks
like you'll have

374
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:56,767
a very interesting
future.

375
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:58,903
With a very
odd niece.

376
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:03,341
One more thing:
Did she say
anything else

377
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:05,910
about my future
in antiques?

378
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:12,383
Uhh! Unh! Grr-grr!

379
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,598
Uh-oh.

380
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,133
The old days.

381
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:34,872
Time continuum's
good as new.

382
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:36,073
But I still can't
figure out

383
00:19:36,075 --> 00:19:37,208
how you made
a wormhole

384
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,576
without going
supersonic.

385
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:40,211
I did go supersonic.

386
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:42,380
See, the rabbit talisman
has magic powers, and--

387
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:44,649
(chuckles)
Magic powers.

388
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:47,251
I'll prove it!
Hey, Jackie,
can I borrow the--

389
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,956
heh. Never mind.

390
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,258
What is taking them
so long?

391
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,329
(Old man's voice)
Yo, big v.

392
00:19:58,331 --> 00:20:00,998
We, uh, took
the long way home.

393
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,233
So, uh,

394
00:20:02,235 --> 00:20:04,035
you can change us
back, right?

395
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:10,575
Interviewer:
Hey, Jackie...

396
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:12,143
Were you cool
when you were a kid?

397
00:20:12,145 --> 00:20:14,011
All the kids
in the school--
they didn't like me.

398
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:17,648
I remember we testing,

399
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:20,418
uh, the skill
in the school.

400
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,286
One by one,
you'd do a somersault,

401
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:25,923
do different tricks
to pass the test.

402
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:27,124
They all push me.

403
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:28,759
They go first.
They go first.

404
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:30,795
I'm the last one.
What I'm gonna do?

405
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:33,231
Everybody
do somersault--shoo!

406
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:34,699
Shoo! Shoo!

407
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:38,102
I go out, I do one
somersault like this.

408
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:41,172
That low. My nose
just touch the ground.

409
00:20:41,174 --> 00:20:43,341
Then the teacher,
"oh, good."

410
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:45,910
So, I think, "I'm cool."
