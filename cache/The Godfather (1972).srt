1
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:54,131
I believe in America.

2
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:57,213
America has made my fortune.

3
00:00:57,349 --> 00:01:01,559
And I raised my daughter
in the American fashion.

4
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:06,355
I gave her freedom, but I taught her
never to dishonor her family.

5
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,897
She found a boyfriend, not an Italian.

6
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:15,573
She went to the movies with him.
She stayed out late.

7
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,241
I didn't protest.

8
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:22,989
Two months ago he took her for a drive
with another boyfriend.

9
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,579
They made her drink whiskey

10
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:31,172
and then they tried to
take advantage of her.

11
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:35,422
She resisted, she kept her honor.

12
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:39,547
So they beat her like an animal.

13
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:46,597
When I went to the hospital,
her nose was broken,

14
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:51,025
her jaw was shattered,
held together by wire.

15
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,568
She couldn't even weep
because of the pain.

16
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:02,195
But I wept. Why did I weep?

17
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,249
She was the light of my life.

18
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,828
Beautiful girl.

19
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:17,634
Now she will never be beautiful again.

20
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:25,509
Sorry.

21
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:38,490
I went to the police,
like a good American.

22
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:41,200
These two boys were brought to trial.

23
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:45,029
The judge sentenced them
to three years in prison,

24
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,285
but suspended the sentence.

25
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:53,463
Suspended the sentence!
They went free that very day!

26
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:59,002
I stood in the courtroom like a fool.

27
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:02,680
Those two bastards, they smiled at me.

28
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:09,521
Then I said to my wife, "For justice,
we must go to Don Corleone."

29
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:19,314
Why did you go to the police?
Why didn't you come to me first?

30
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:25,536
What do you want of me? Tell me
anything, but do what I beg you to do.

31
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:27,246
What is that?

32
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,171
I want them dead.

33
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,681
That I cannot do.

34
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,477
I'll give you anything you ask.

35
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:05,364
I've known you many years, but this
is the first time you've asked for help.

36
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:11,620
I can't remember the last time
you invited me for a cup of coffee.

37
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:16,545
Even though my wife is godmother
to your only child.

38
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:21,626
But let's be frank here.
You never wanted my friendship.

39
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:25,426
And you were afraid to be in my debt.

40
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,798
I didn't want to
get into trouble.

41
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,763
I understand.

42
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:34,980
You found Paradise in America.

43
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,945
You made a good living, had police
protection and there were courts of law.

44
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,694
You didn't need a friend like me.

45
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:49,953
But now you come to me and say,

46
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,577
"Don Corleone, give me justice."

47
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:57,249
But you don't ask with respect.

48
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:01,999
You don't offer friendship. You don't
even think to call me Godfather.

49
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:10,805
You come on my daughter's wedding
day and ask me to murder for money.

50
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:13,352
I ask you for justice.

51
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:16,396
That is not justice.
Your daughter is alive.

52
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:20,776
Let them suffer, then, as she suffers.

53
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:25,280
How much shall I pay you?

54
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:43,795
Bonasera, Bonasera.

55
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:48,004
What have I ever done to make you
treat me so disrespectfully?

56
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,844
If you'd come in friendship,

57
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:56,224
the scum that ruined your daughter
would be suffering this very day.

58
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:02,610
And if an honest man like you should
make enemies, they'd be my enemies.

59
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,278
And then they would fear you.

60
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,824
Be my friend?

61
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,455
Godfather?

62
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:24,884
Good.

63
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:32,298
Some day, and that day may never
come, I'll ask a service of you.

64
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,934
But until that day

65
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:41,808
accept this justice as a gift
on my daughter's wedding day.

66
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:44,439
- <i>Gràzie,</i> Godfather.
<i>- Prego.</i>

67
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:54,111
Give this to Clemenza.

68
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:59,867
I want people that aren't going to
get carried away.

69
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:04,125
We're not murderers,
in spite of what this undertaker says.

70
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:32,820
- Where's Michael?
- Don't worry, he'll be here.

71
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:37,072
We're not taking the picture
without Michael.

72
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,963
- What's the matter?
- It's Michael.

73
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:37,139
Don Barzini.

74
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:57,026
Hey, Paulie! Let me have some wine.

75
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,403
Paulie! More wine.

76
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:04,450
- You look terrific on the floor.
- Are you a dance judge or something?

77
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,203
Take a walk and do your job.

78
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:19,635
Sandra, watch the kids.
Don't let them run wild.

79
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:22,055
You watch yourself, all right?

80
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:47,584
20, 30 grand. In small bills, cash.

81
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:51,042
In that little silk purse.

82
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:54,625
If this were somebody else's wedding...
<i>Sfortunato!</i>

83
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,005
Hey, Paulie!

84
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:59,885
I got two gabagool, capocol,
and a prosciut.

85
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,051
Stupid jerk!

86
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,100
What's the matter?

87
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,915
- Have to go back to work.
- Tom.

88
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:31,082
No Sicilian can refuse any request
on his daughter's wedding day.

89
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:42,136
Don Corleone, I'm honored and
grateful that you have invited me.

90
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,018
Get out of here!
It's a private party. Go on!

91
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:54,025
What is it? It's my sister's wedding.

92
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,451
Goddamn FBI
don't respect nothing!

93
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:09,870
Come here, come here, come here!

94
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:28,685
But towards the end, he was paroled
to help with the American war effort,

95
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:31,889
so for six months
he's worked in my pastry shop.

96
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:34,099
Nazorine, what can I do for you?

97
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,734
Now that the war is over,

98
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:40,815
this boy, Enzo, they want to
repatriate him back to Italy.

99
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:45,695
Godfather, I have a daughter.
You see, she and Enzo...

100
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:50,832
You want Enzo to stay in this country,
and your daughter to be married.

101
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:54,919
You understand everything.

102
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,173
Mr. Hagen. Thank you.

103
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:05,131
Wait till you see the wedding cake
I made for your daughter!

104
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:08,183
The bride, the groom and the angel...

105
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:17,943
- Who should I give this job to?
- Not to our <i>paisan.</i>

106
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:23,195
Give it to a Jew Congressman in
another district. Who else is on the list?

107
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,740
Hey, Michael!

108
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:55,063
He's not on the list,
but Luca Brasi wants to see you.

109
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,150
Is this necessary?

110
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:07,986
He didn't expect to be invited to the
wedding, so he wanted to thank you.

111
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:14,704
Don Corleone, I'm honored and
grateful that you have invited me

112
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:17,578
on the wedding day of your daughter.

113
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:20,209
May their first child
be a masculine child.

114
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,707
Michael...

115
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,929
That man over there
is talking to himself.

116
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,845
See that scary guy over there?

117
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:34,303
- He's a very scary guy.
- What's his name?

118
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:39,275
His name is Luca Brasi.
He helps my father out sometimes.

119
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,896
Michael, he's coming over here!

120
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:50,160
You look terrific!

121
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:53,326
My brother Tom Hagen,
Miss Kay Adams.

122
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:57,409
Your father's been asking for you.

123
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,245
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

124
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,841
Why does your brother
have a different name?

125
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:08,837
My brother Sonny found Tom Hagen
in the street.

126
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:12,765
He had no home,
so my father took him in.

127
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:17,642
He's been with us ever since.

128
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:19,643
He's a good lawyer.

129
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:25,188
Not a Sicilian. I think
he's going to be <i>consigliere.</i>

130
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:28,190
- What's that?
- That's a,

131
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:31,990
like a counselor, an advisor.
Very important for the family.

132
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:35,163
You like your lasagne?

133
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,582
Don Corleone.

134
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,251
I'm honored and grateful

135
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:48,381
that you have invited me
to your daughter's wedding.

136
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:56,552
On the day of your daughter's wedding.

137
00:14:56,687 --> 00:15:01,523
And I hope that their first child
will be a masculine child.

138
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:08,151
I pledge my ever-ending loyalty.

139
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:15,074
- For your daughter's bridal purse.
- Thank you, Luca. Most valued friend.

140
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:20,622
Don Corleone, I'm going to leave you
now, because I know you're busy.

141
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,543
Thank you.

142
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:14,508
<i>Signora</i> Corleone!

143
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:18,550
No!

144
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:32,545
Senator Cauley apologized for not
coming, but said you'd understand.

145
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:36,716
Also some of the judges.
They've all sent gifts.

146
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,351
What is that outside?

147
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:54,776
Johnny! Johnny!

148
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:57,657
I love you!

149
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:11,379
He came all the way from California.
I told you he'd come!

150
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:14,833
- He's probably in trouble again.
- He's a good godson.

151
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:20,221
Johnny, Johnny! Sing a song!

152
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,572
You never said
you knew Johnny Fontane!

153
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:42,744
- Sure. You want to meet him?
- Great! Sure.

154
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:46,619
- My father helped him with his career.
- He did?

155
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:47,832
How?

156
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:53,296
- Let's listen to this song.
- Michael...

157
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,664
Please, Michael. Tell me.

158
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:37,336
When Johnny was starting out, he was
signed to a personal service contract

159
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:40,335
with a big bandleader.

160
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:44,715
And as his career got better and better,
he wanted to get out of it.

161
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:48,430
Johnny is my father's godson.

162
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:51,684
My father went to see this bandleader.

163
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:55,684
He offered him $10,000
to let Johnny go,

164
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,562
but the bandleader said no.

165
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:04,026
So the next day my father went to see
him, but this time with Luca Brasi.

166
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:08,072
Within an hour,

167
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:13,751
he signed a release
for a certified check of $1,000.

168
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:19,715
- How did he do that?
- Made him an offer he couldn't refuse.

169
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:26,173
- What was that?
- Luca Brasi held a gun to his head,

170
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:31,553
and father said that either his brains or
his signature would be on the contract.

171
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,105
That's a true story.

172
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:52,290
That's my family, Kay. It's not me.

173
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,546
Beautiful!

174
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:40,792
I'll take care of it.

175
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:42,757
Tom...

176
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:46,757
I want you to find Santino.
Tell him to come to the office.

177
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:56,679
How are you, Fredo?

178
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:59,482
My brother Fredo, this is Kay Adams.

179
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:02,773
- Hi.
- How are you doing?

180
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:09,405
- This is my brother Mike.
- Are you having a good time?

181
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:11,862
Yeah. This is your friend?

182
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:16,833
I don't know what to do.
My voice is weak. It's weak.

183
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:24,883
Anyway, if I had this part in the picture,
it puts me right back on top again.

184
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:30,426
But this... man won't give it to me,
the head of the studio.

185
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:33,634
- What's his name?
- Woltz.

186
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:37,891
He won't give it to me,
and he says there's no chance.

187
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,525
Sonny?

188
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,236
Sonny?

189
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:53,830
Sonny?

190
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:57,452
- Sonny, are you in there?
- What?

191
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,159
The old man wants you.

192
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,462
One minute.

193
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:21,856
A month ago he bought the
movie rights to this book, a best-seller.

194
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:25,685
The main character
is a guy just like me.

195
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:28,316
I wouldn't even have to act.

196
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:32,116
Godfather, I don't know what to do.

197
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:37,910
You can act like a man!
What's the matter with you?

198
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,586
Is this how you turned out? A Hollywood
<i>finocchio</i> that cries like a woman?

199
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:47,753
"What can I do?
What can I do?" What is that nonsense?

200
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,504
Ridiculous.

201
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:57,304
- You spend time with your family?
- Sure I do.

202
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:58,884
Good.

203
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:03,894
Because a man who doesn't spend time
with his family can never be a real man.

204
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:12,740
You look terrible. I want you to eat.

205
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:18,284
Rest, and in a month this Hollywood
big shot will give you what you want.

206
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:21,537
It's too late,
they start shooting in a week.

207
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:24,790
I'm going to make him an offer
he can't refuse.

208
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:32,594
Just go outside and enjoy yourself,
and forget about all this nonsense.

209
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:37,890
- I want you to leave it all to me.
- All right.

210
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:08,038
- What time does my daughter leave?
Soon, after they cut the cake.

211
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:11,916
Do we give your son-in-law
something important?

212
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:17,218
Never. Give him a living, but never
discuss the family business with him.

213
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:20,049
- What else?
- Virgil Sollozzo called.

214
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:24,725
- We'll have to see him next week.
- When you come back from California.

215
00:25:25,983 --> 00:25:29,192
- When am I going to California?
- Tonight.

216
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:34,648
I want you to talk to this movie big shot
and settle this business for Johnny.

217
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:39,990
If there's nothing else, I'd like to go
to my daughter's wedding.

218
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:45,120
Carlo, we're going to take the picture.

219
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,918
Wait a minute.

220
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:50,414
No, Michael. Not me.

221
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:57,887
Okay, that's it. Just like that. Hold it!

222
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,727
You need
a little more heat on that arc.

223
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,207
Start talking.

224
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:54,579
I was sent by a friend
of Johnny Fontane.

225
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:58,382
This friend would give
his friendship to Mr. Woltz,

226
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:01,335
if Mr. Woltz would grant us a favor.

227
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,797
Woltz is listening.

228
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:08,010
Give Johnny the part in that war film
you're starting next week.

229
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:18,690
And what favor would your friend
grant Mr. Woltz?

230
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:22,190
He could make your future union
problems disappear.

231
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:26,403
And one of your stars has just moved
from marijuana to heroin.

232
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:30,911
Are you trying to muscle me?
Listen, you son-of-a-bitch!

233
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:33,501
Let me lay it on the line.

234
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:35,620
Johnny Fontane
will never get that movie!

235
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:40,174
No matter how many Dago Guinea
greaseballs come out of the woodwork!

236
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:44,128
- I'm German-Irish.
- Listen here, my Kraut-Mick friend.

237
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:48,638
- I'm going to make trouble for you!
- I'm a lawyer. I haven't threatened...

238
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:52,220
I know New York's big lawyers.
Who are you?

239
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:55,727
I have a special practice.
I handle one client.

240
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,850
I'll wait for your call.

241
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:02,446
By the way,
I admire your pictures very much.

242
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:08,820
Check him out.

243
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:33,890
- It's really beautiful.
- Look at this.

244
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:38,441
- It used to decorate a king's palace.
- Very nice.

245
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:41,019
Why didn't you say
you work for Corleone?

246
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:45,443
I thought you were some cheap hustler
Johnny was running in.

247
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:48,693
- I only use his name when necessary.
- How's your drink?

248
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:52,155
- Fine.
- Now I'll show you something beautiful.

249
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:54,953
You do appreciate beauty, don't you?

250
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:01,004
There you are. $600,000 on four hoofs.

251
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:05,092
I bet Russian czars never paid
that for a singe horse.

252
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:06,543
Khartoum.

253
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:08,462
Khartoum.

254
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:14,352
I'm not going to race him, though.
I'm going to put him out to stud.

255
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:17,517
Thanks, Tony.

256
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:21,188
Let's get something to eat.

257
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,779
Corleone is Johnny's godfather.

258
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:29,195
To the Italian people that's
a very sacred, close relationship.

259
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:33,162
I respect it.
Tell him to ask me anything else.

260
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,740
This favor I can't give him.

261
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:39,247
He never asks a second favor
when he's been refused the first.

262
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:45,295
You don't understand.
Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.

263
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:49,253
That part is perfect for him.
It'll make him a big star.

264
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:53,223
I'm going to run him out of the business,
and let me tell you why.

265
00:30:55,228 --> 00:31:00,143
Johnny Fontane ruined one of Woltz
International's most valuable protégés.

266
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:05,444
We trained her for five years.
Singing, acting, dancing lessons.

267
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:10,362
I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars
on her, to make her a big star.

268
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:13,194
Let me be even more frank.

269
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:18,249
To show you that I'm not a hard-hearted
man. That it's not all dollars and cents.

270
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:21,961
She was beautiful.
She was young and innocent!

271
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:27,258
She's the greatest piece of ass I've had
and I've had them all over the world.

272
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:33,598
Then Johnny Fontane comes along with
his olive oil voice and Guinea charm.

273
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:35,265
And she runs off.

274
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:40,850
She threw it all away
just to make me look ridiculous!

275
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:46,193
And a man in my position can't afford
to be made to look ridiculous!

276
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,441
You get the hell out of here!

277
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:52,988
If that goombah tries any rough stuff,
tell him I'm no bandleader.

278
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:57,287
Yeah, I heard that story.

279
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:02,247
Thank you for dinner
and a very pleasant evening.

280
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:05,125
Maybe your car can take me
to the airport.

281
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:08,841
Mr. Corleone insists on hearing
bad news immediately.

282
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:05,412
- You're not too tired, are you, Tom?
- No, I slept on the plane.

283
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:08,369
I have the Sollozzo notes here.

284
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:09,794
Now...

285
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,134
Sollozzo is known as The Turk.

286
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,927
He's supposed to be very good
with a knife,

287
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:21,970
<i>but only in matters of business
with reasonable complaint.</i>

288
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,394
<i>His business is narcotics.</i>

289
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,689
<i>He has fields in Turkey,
where they grow poppy.</i>

290
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:32,606
<i>In Sicily he has plants
to process them into heroin.</i>

291
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:36,405
<i>He needs cash,
he needs protection from the police.</i>

292
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:40,405
<i>He'll give a piece of the action.
I don't know how much.</i>

293
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:45,490
<i>The Tattaglia family is behind him here.
They have to be in it for something.</i>

294
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:51,336
- What about his prison record?
- One term in Italy, one here.

295
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:54,081
He's known as a top narcotics man.

296
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:59,094
- Santino, what do you think?
- A lot of money in that white powder.

297
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:02,722
Tom?

298
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:07,061
<i>Yes. There's more money
in narcotics than anything else.</i>

299
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:11,857
<i>If we don't get into it, somebody else
will, maybe the five families.</i>

300
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:16,528
With that money they can buy
more police and political power.

301
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:18,522
Then they come after us.

302
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:25,280
Now we have unions and gambling, and
that's great, but narcotics is the future.

303
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:30,493
If we don't get a piece of that action,
we risk everything in 10 years' time.

304
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:38,042
So? What's your answer
going to be, Pop?

305
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:44,681
Don Corleone.

306
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:49,887
I need a man who has powerful friends.

307
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:52,682
I need a million dollars in cash.

308
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:58,567
I need those politicians that you carry
in your pocket, like nickels and dimes.

309
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:04,197
- What is the interest for my family?
- 30%.

310
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:08,288
In the first year your end should be
three, four million dollars.

311
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:10,332
And then it would go up.

312
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:14,874
And what is the interest
for the Tattaglia family?

313
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,669
My compliments.

314
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:25,798
I'll take care of them, out of my share.

315
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:30,223
So I receive 30% for finance,

316
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:33,560
political influence and legal protection?

317
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:35,524
That's right.

318
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:40,570
Why do you come to me?
Why do I deserve this generosity?

319
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:46,035
If you consider a million dollars in cash
just finance,

320
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:48,369
<i>te salud,</i> Don Corleone.

321
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:04,003
I said that I would see you, because
I heard you were a serious man,

322
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:06,426
to be treated with respect.

323
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:14,433
But, I must say no to you.

324
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:18,438
And I'll give you my reason.

325
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:21,278
It's true,
I have a lot of friends in politics.

326
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:26,946
They wouldn't be friendly long if I was
involved in drugs instead of gambling,

327
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:32,577
which they regard as a harmless vice,
but drugs is a dirty business.

328
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:37,628
It doesn't make any difference to me
what a man does for a living.

329
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:43,047
But your business is... a little dangerous.

330
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:47,718
If you're worried about security,
the Tattaglias will guarantee it.

331
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:51,217
- The Tattaglias would guarantee our...
- Wait a minute.

332
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:03,316
I have a sentimental weakness
for my children, and I spoil them.

333
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:06,736
They talk when they should listen.
But anyway...

334
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:12,079
<i>Signor</i> Sollozzo, my no is final. I wish to
congratulate you on your new business.

335
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:15,745
I know you'll do well, and good luck.

336
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:20,667
Especially since your interests
don't conflict with mine. Thank you.

337
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:43,102
Santino.

338
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:45,024
Come here.

339
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:49,278
What's the matter with you?

340
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:53,954
Your brain is going soft
from playing with that girl.

341
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:58,167
Never tell anybody outside the family
what you're thinking again.

342
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:00,911
Go on.

343
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:07,631
Tom, what's this nonsense?

344
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:10,345
It's from Johnny.
He's starring in that new film.

345
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,892
- Take it away.
- Take it over there.

346
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,937
And

347
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:21,898
tell Luca Brasi to come in.

348
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:31,650
I'm a little worried
about this Sollozzo fellow.

349
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:34,369
Find out what he's got
under his fingernails.

350
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:39,241
Go to the Tattaglias.

351
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:43,746
Make them think that you're not
too happy with our family

352
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:47,424
and find out what you can.

353
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:08,145
I got something for your mother
and for Sonny

354
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:12,824
and a tie for Freddy,
and Tom Hagen got the Reynolds pen.

355
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:16,240
- What do you want for Christmas?
- Just you.

356
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:50,062
<i>Andiamo,</i> Fredo.

357
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:53,691
- Tell Paulie to get the car.
- Okay, Pop.

358
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:57,694
I'll have to get it myself.
Paulie called in sick this morning.

359
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:02,745
Paulie's a good kid.
I don't mind getting the car.

360
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:08,254
<i>Buon natale, Caro. Gràzie.</i>

361
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:55,128
- Luca! I'm Bruno Tattaglia.
- I know.

362
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:59,803
- Su bequero scotch. Pre-war.
- I don't drink.

363
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,054
You know who I am?

364
00:42:06,149 --> 00:42:07,560
I know you.

365
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:12,402
You have been talking
to the Tattaglia family... right?

366
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:17,400
I think you and I can do business.

367
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:22,036
I need someone strong like you.

368
00:42:22,582 --> 00:42:25,370
I heard you are not happy...

369
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:28,000
with the Corleone family.

370
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:30,624
Want to join me?

371
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:33,798
What's in it for me?

372
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:38,136
$50,000 to start with.

373
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:42,556
Not bad!

374
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:45,931
Agreed?

375
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:49,074
Tom! Tom Hagen. Merry Christmas.

376
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:54,083
- Glad to see you. I want to talk to you.
- I haven't got time.

377
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:57,040
Make time, <i>Consigliere.</i> Get in the car.

378
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:03,510
What are you worried about? If I wanted
to kill you, you'd be dead already.

379
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,131
Get in.

380
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:19,818
- Fredo, I'm going to buy some fruit.
- Okay, Pop.

381
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:29,327
Merry Christmas. I want some fruit.

382
00:45:57,004 --> 00:46:01,043
Would you like me better
if I were a nun? Like in the story.

383
00:46:04,053 --> 00:46:05,053
No.

384
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:09,552
- What if I were Ingrid Bergman?
- Now, that's a thought.

385
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:14,056
Michael.

386
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:17,559
No, I wouldn't like you better
if you were Ingrid Bergman.

387
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:18,981
What's the matter?

388
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:38,167
They don't say if he's dead or alive.

389
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:03,602
Sonny, it's Michael
- <i>Where have you been?</i>

390
00:47:03,696 --> 00:47:06,404
- Is he all right?
- <i>We don't know yet.</i>

391
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:10,575
<i>There are all kinds of stories.
He was hit bad, Mikey.</i>

392
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:15,909
<i>- Are you there?</i>
- Yeah, I'm here.

393
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:20,878
- <i>Where have you been? I was worried.</i>
- Didn't Tom tell you I called?

394
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:24,999
<i>No. Look, come home, kid.
You should be with Mama, you hear?</i>

395
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:34,049
Oh, my God.

396
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:39,311
Sonny!

397
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:50,531
Stay back there.

398
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:53,242
- Who is it?
Open up, it's Clemenza.

399
00:47:55,748 --> 00:47:59,082
There's more news about your old man.

400
00:47:59,168 --> 00:48:01,375
Word is out that he's already dead.

401
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:05,538
- What's the matter with you?
- Take it easy!

402
00:48:05,758 --> 00:48:09,126
- Where was Paulie?
- Sick. He's been sick all winter.

403
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:11,502
- How often?
- Only three, four times.

404
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:15,348
- Freddy didn't want a new bodyguard.
- Pick him up now.

405
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:20,266
I don't care how sick he is. Bring him
to my father's house right now.

406
00:48:20,356 --> 00:48:23,439
- You want anyone sent over here?
- No. Go ahead.

407
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:35,277
I'm going to have a couple of our people
come over to the house.

408
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:41,783
- Hello?
<i>- Santino Corleone?</i>

409
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:44,661
- Yeah.
- <i>We have Tom Hagen.</i>

410
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:48,373
<i>In three hours he'll be released
with our proposition.</i>

411
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:51,968
<i>Listen to what he has to say
before you do anything.</i>

412
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:56,590
<i>What's done is done. Don't lose that
famous temper of yours, Sonny.</i>

413
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:58,307
I'll wait.

414
00:49:12,575 --> 00:49:14,566
Your boss is dead.

415
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:22,120
I know you're not in the muscle end
of the family, so don't be scared.

416
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:27,044
I want you to help the Corleones
and me.

417
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:35,379
We got him outside his office
about an hour after we picked you up.

418
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:38,297
Drink it.

419
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:46,518
It's up to you to make peace
between me and Sonny.

420
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:53,529
Sonny was hot for my deal, wasn't he?

421
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:57,571
And you knew
it was the right thing to do.

422
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:03,827
- Sonny will come after you.
- That will be his first reaction, sure.

423
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:11,836
So you have to talk sense into him.
The Tattaglia family is behind me.

424
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:17,053
The other New York families will go
along with anything to prevent war.

425
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:22,392
Let's face it, with all due respect,
the Don - rest in peace - was slipping.

426
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:28,389
Ten years ago,
could I have gotten to him?

427
00:50:32,238 --> 00:50:36,197
Well, now he's dead, Tom,
and nothing can bring him back.

428
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:43,784
You've got to talk to Sonny, to the
Caporegimes, Tessio, fat Clemenza.

429
00:50:48,671 --> 00:50:50,833
It's good business, Tom.

430
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:57,089
I'll try. But even Sonny won't be able
to call off Luca Brasi.

431
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:01,885
Yeah, well...

432
00:51:03,686 --> 00:51:06,178
Let me worry about Luca.

433
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,226
You just talk to Sonny.

434
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:15,027
And the other two kids.

435
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:21,651
- I'll do my best.
- Good.

436
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:26,409
Now you can go.

437
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:37,800
I don't like violence, Tom.
I'm a businessman.

438
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:40,469
Blood is a big expense.

439
00:52:01,702 --> 00:52:03,568
He's still alive.

440
00:52:03,704 --> 00:52:07,538
They hit him with five shots,
and he's still alive!

441
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:12,370
That's bad luck for me, and bad luck
for you if you don't make that deal.

442
00:52:57,091 --> 00:53:01,881
Your mother is at the hospital with your
father. Looks like he'll pull through.

443
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:10,428
It's a lot of bad blood. Sollozzo, Philip
Tattaglia, Bruno Tattaglia, Ramon...

444
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:13,805
You gonna kill all those guys?
Stay out of it.

445
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:16,524
If you get rid of Sollozzo,
everything falls into line.

446
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:20,695
What about Luca?
Sollozzo thinks he can control him.

447
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:24,524
If Luca sold out,
we're in a lot of trouble.

448
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:28,407
Has anyone been in touch with Luca?
- We've been trying all night.

449
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:29,574
Hey, do me a favor...

450
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:32,540
Luca never sleeps over
with a broad.

451
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:39,623
Well, Tom, you're <i>consigliere.</i>
What do we do if the on man dies?

452
00:53:40,801 --> 00:53:47,138
If we lose the old man, we lose the
political contacts and half our strength.

453
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:52,810
The other New York families might
support Sollozzo to avoid a long war.

454
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:57,557
This is almost 1946.
Nobody wants bloodshed anymore.

455
00:53:57,651 --> 00:53:59,233
If your father dies

456
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,487
you make the deal.

457
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:08,405
Easy to say. He's not your father.
- I'm as much a son as you or Mike.

458
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:14,582
What is it?

459
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:21,293
- Paulie, I told you to stay put.
- The guy at the gates has a package.

460
00:54:21,425 --> 00:54:23,507
Tessio, go see what it is.

461
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:29,005
- Shall I stay?
- Yeah. Are you all right?

462
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:32,842
- I'm fine.
- There's food. Are you hungry?

463
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:36,642
- No.
- A drink? Brandy will sweat it out.

464
00:54:36,732 --> 00:54:39,269
- Go ahead.
- That might be a good idea.

465
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:47,073
Take care of that son-of-a-bitch.
Paulie sold out the old man.

466
00:54:47,201 --> 00:54:50,364
- Make that the first thing on your list.
Understood.

467
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:55,115
Mickey, tomorrow, get some guys
and go to Luca's apartment.

468
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:58,868
Maybe we shouldn't get Mike
mixed up in this too directly.

469
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:05,212
Hanging around the house
on the phone would be a big help.

470
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:07,919
Try Luca again.

471
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:19,643
- What's this?
- A Sicilian message.

472
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:22,725
It means Luca Brasi
sleeps with the fishes.

473
00:55:36,375 --> 00:55:38,491
- I'm going.
- When will you be home?

474
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:40,167
Probably late.

475
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:46,465
- Don't forget the <i>cannoli!</i>
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

476
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:53,131
Rocco, sit on the other side.
You block the rear-view mirror.

477
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:58,098
Sonny's running wild. He wants
to go to mattresses already.

478
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:04,059
We have to find a spot on the
West Side. Try 309 West 43rd Street.

479
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:07,816
- Know a good spot on the West Side?
- I'll think about it.

480
00:56:07,948 --> 00:56:11,612
Think while you're driving.
I want to hit New York this month.

481
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:13,359
Watch the kids.

482
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:25,921
Paulie, go down 39th Street,

483
00:56:26,008 --> 00:56:30,002
pick up 18 mattresses
and bring me the bill.

484
00:56:30,137 --> 00:56:31,627
Yeah, all right.

485
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:33,094
Make sure they're clean,

486
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:36,014
because the guys
will be there a long time.

487
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:38,384
They're clean and exterminated.

488
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,431
That's a bad word to use.

489
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:44,432
Exterminate! Watch out,
so we don't exterminate you!

490
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:53,733
Pull over.
I've got to take a leak.

491
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:38,820
Leave the gun. Take the <i>cannoli.</i>

492
00:57:57,057 --> 00:57:59,890
Hey, Mike! Hey, Mikey!

493
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,636
- Yeah.
- Phone call!

494
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:11,898
- Who is it?
- Some girl.

495
00:58:16,368 --> 00:58:18,860
- Hello. Kay.
<i>- How's your father?</i>

496
00:58:18,996 --> 00:58:20,782
He's going to make it.

497
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:23,075
<i>I love you.</i>

498
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:24,573
Huh?

499
00:58:24,668 --> 00:58:26,158
<i>I love you!</i>

500
00:58:27,004 --> 00:58:29,792
- <i>Michael?</i>
- Yeah, I know.

501
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:32,794
- <i>Tell me you love me.</i>
- I can't talk.

502
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:34,670
<i>Can't you say it?</i>

503
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:37,840
I'll see you tonight.

504
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:41,678
Why don't you tell that nice girl
you love her?

505
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:46,179
I love you with all my heart. If I don't
see you again soon, I'm going to die!

506
00:58:47,691 --> 00:58:52,481
Come and learn something. You might
have to cook for 20 guys some day.

507
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:56,230
You start with a little oil,
then fry some garlic.

508
00:58:56,324 --> 00:59:01,819
Throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste,
fry it and make sure it doesn't stick.

509
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:06,032
You get it to a boil, you shove in
all your sausage and meatballs.

510
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:09,994
Add a little bit of wine.

511
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:17,840
And a little bit of sugar.
That's my trick.

512
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:22,056
Cut the crap. I have more important
things for you. How's Paulie?

513
00:59:22,142 --> 00:59:24,474
You won't see him no more.

514
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:28,437
- Where are you going?
- To the city.

515
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:30,752
- Send bodyguards with him.
- I'm going to the hospital...

516
00:59:30,776 --> 00:59:32,086
Never mind, send somebody with him.

517
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:35,444
He'll be all right.
Sollozzo knows he's a civilian.

518
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:37,487
- Be careful.
- Yes, sir.

519
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:42,443
Send somebody with him anyway.

520
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:14,146
- I have to go.
- Can I go with you?

521
01:00:15,904 --> 01:00:20,114
No, Kay. There will be detectives there,
people from the press.

522
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,316
I'll wait in the cab.

523
01:00:25,122 --> 01:00:27,614
I don't want you to get involved.

524
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:32,576
When will I see you again?

525
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:43,174
Go back to New Hampshire,
and I'll call you at your parents' house.

526
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:49,560
- When will I see you again, Michael?
- I don't know.

527
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:05,646
What are you doing here?
You're not supposed to be here.

528
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:09,108
I'm Michael Corleone. This is my father.

529
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:11,660
What happened to the guards?

530
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:17,207
Your father had too many visitors.
They interfered with hospital service.

531
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:20,498
The police made them leave
about 10 minutes ago.

532
01:03:25,135 --> 01:03:29,094
Get me Long Beach 45620, please.

533
01:03:31,516 --> 01:03:33,928
Nurse. Wait a minute. Stay here.

534
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:42,817
Sonny, I'm at the hospital.
I got here late, there's nobody here.

535
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:47,233
No Tessio's men,
no detectives, nobody. Papa's all alone.

536
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:49,732
- <i>Don't panic.</i>
- I won't panic.

537
01:03:51,328 --> 01:03:54,161
I'm sorry, but you will have to leave.

538
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:59,579
We're going to move him
to another room.

539
01:03:59,711 --> 01:04:02,749
Can you disconnect the tubes?

540
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:06,207
- That's out of the question!
Do you know my father?

541
01:04:06,343 --> 01:04:10,758
Men are coming here to kill him.
Do you understand?

542
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:12,554
Help me, please.

543
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:33,377
- Who are you?
- I am Enzo, the baker.

544
01:05:34,431 --> 01:05:36,468
- Remember me?
- Enzo.

545
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:39,717
You'd better go,
there's going to be trouble.

546
01:05:39,853 --> 01:05:44,393
If there is trouble, I'll stay here
to help you. For your father.

547
01:05:46,401 --> 01:05:50,611
Listen. Wait for me outside,
in front of the hospital, all right?

548
01:05:50,697 --> 01:05:52,734
I'll be out in a minute.

549
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:10,377
Just lie here, Pop.
I'll take care of you now.

550
01:06:12,343 --> 01:06:14,380
I'm with you now.

551
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:17,341
I'm with you.

552
01:06:52,926 --> 01:06:55,133
Get rid of these. Come here.

553
01:06:56,095 --> 01:07:00,589
Put your hand in your pocket,
like you have a gun. You'll be all right.

554
01:07:06,523 --> 01:07:07,729
You'll be okay.

555
01:07:51,776 --> 01:07:53,608
You did good.

556
01:08:42,035 --> 01:08:45,369
I thought all you Guinea hoods
were locked up!

557
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:49,995
- Why isn't anyone guarding my father?
- You little punk!

558
01:08:50,084 --> 01:08:54,043
Don't you tell me my business!
I pulled them off.

559
01:08:54,172 --> 01:09:00,009
Stay away from this hospital!
- Not until my father's room is guarded.

560
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:04,216
- Phil, take him in!
- The kid's clean, Captain.

561
01:09:04,307 --> 01:09:08,050
- He's a war hero. He's never been...
I said take him in!

562
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:16,608
- What's The Turk paying you?
- Take a hold of him. Stand him up.

563
01:09:16,694 --> 01:09:18,526
Stand him up straight.

564
01:09:40,718 --> 01:09:46,304
I'm the Corleones' attorney. These men
are hired to protect Vito Corleone.

565
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:48,673
They're licensed to carry firearms.

566
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:53,304
If you interfere, you'll have to appear
before the judge and show cause.

567
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:55,350
Let him go.

568
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:31,599
- What's with all the new faces?
- We'll need them now.

569
01:10:31,686 --> 01:10:34,223
After the hospital thing, Sonny got mad.

570
01:10:34,355 --> 01:10:37,723
We hit Bruno Tattaglia this morning.

571
01:10:38,943 --> 01:10:40,900
Jesus Christ.

572
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:50,156
Looks like a fortress around here.

573
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:57,667
<i>Tamaduch!</i> Hey... 100 buttonmen
on the street 24 hours a day.

574
01:10:57,754 --> 01:11:01,338
That Turk shows one hair on his ass,
he's dead.

575
01:11:03,384 --> 01:11:05,500
Mike, let me look at you.

576
01:11:09,557 --> 01:11:12,720
You're beautiful, beautiful.
You're gorgeous.

577
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:18,305
The Turk wants to talk!
Imagine the nerve of the son-of-a-bitch.

578
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:21,141
- He wants a meeting today.
- What did he say?

579
01:11:21,235 --> 01:11:25,980
What did he say... He wants us to send
Michael to hear the proposition.

580
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:29,608
He promises that the deal
is too good to refuse.

581
01:11:29,702 --> 01:11:32,694
- And Bruno Tattaglia?
- That's part of the deal.

582
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:37,033
- He cancels out what they did to Father.
- We should listen to them.

583
01:11:37,168 --> 01:11:40,377
No more! Not this time, <i>Consigliere.</i>

584
01:11:40,463 --> 01:11:43,831
No more meetings, discussions,
or Sollozzo tricks.

585
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:47,004
I want Sollozzo, or we go to war...

586
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:50,049
- The other families...
- They hand me Sollozzo!

587
01:11:50,181 --> 01:11:52,593
This is business, not personal!

588
01:11:52,683 --> 01:11:56,927
- They shot my father...
- Even that was business, not personal.

589
01:11:57,814 --> 01:12:01,808
Then business will have to suffer.
Do me a favor.

590
01:12:01,901 --> 01:12:05,860
No more advice on how
to patch things up. Just help me win.

591
01:12:12,036 --> 01:12:15,950
I found out about Captain McCluskey,
who broke Mike's jaw.

592
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:20,409
He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll,
and for big money.

593
01:12:20,503 --> 01:12:24,497
McCluskey has agreed
to be The Turk's bodyguard.

594
01:12:24,632 --> 01:12:28,296
So when Sollozzo is being guarded,
he's invulnerable.

595
01:12:28,427 --> 01:12:32,011
Nobody has ever gunned down
a New York police captain.

596
01:12:32,098 --> 01:12:38,014
All the families would come after you.
The Corleone family would be outcasts!

597
01:12:38,104 --> 01:12:41,847
Even the old man's political protection
would run for cover.

598
01:12:43,276 --> 01:12:47,065
Do me a favor.
Take this into consideration.

599
01:12:50,825 --> 01:12:52,816
All right, we'll wait.

600
01:12:58,332 --> 01:13:01,120
We can't wait. We can't wait.

601
01:13:02,712 --> 01:13:06,706
No matter what Sollozzo says,
he's going to kill Pop.

602
01:13:06,841 --> 01:13:10,459
That's the key for him.
We've got to get Sollozzo.

603
01:13:10,553 --> 01:13:14,672
- Mike is right.
- Let me ask you something.

604
01:13:14,807 --> 01:13:19,472
What about this McCluskey?
What do we do with this cop?

605
01:13:24,692 --> 01:13:27,525
They want to have a meeting
with me, right?

606
01:13:28,362 --> 01:13:32,947
It will be me, McCluskey and Sollozzo.

607
01:13:34,952 --> 01:13:36,943
Let's set the meeting.

608
01:13:38,915 --> 01:13:42,749
Get our informers to find out
where it's going to be held.

609
01:13:44,545 --> 01:13:48,334
We insist it's a public place.
A bar, a restaurant.

610
01:13:48,466 --> 01:13:52,084
Some place where there are people,
so I feel safe.

611
01:13:55,014 --> 01:13:57,847
They'll search me
when I meet them, right?

612
01:13:57,934 --> 01:14:00,301
So I can't have a weapon on me.

613
01:14:03,773 --> 01:14:08,768
But if Clemenza can figure out a way to
have a weapon planted there for me

614
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:15,940
then I'll kill them both.

615
01:14:28,047 --> 01:14:32,757
Nice college boy. Didn't want to
get mixed up in the family business.

616
01:14:32,843 --> 01:14:36,427
Now you want to shoot a police captain
because he slapped you?

617
01:14:36,555 --> 01:14:42,927
This isn't like the army! You have to get
close and get their brains on your suit.

618
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:46,138
You're taking this very personal.

619
01:14:46,232 --> 01:14:49,770
Tom, this is business
and he's taking it personal.

620
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:53,319
- Where does it say you can't kill a cop?
- Mikey...

621
01:14:53,406 --> 01:14:59,493
I'm talking about a cop who's mixed up
in drugs, a dishonest cop.

622
01:15:00,538 --> 01:15:04,372
A cop who got mixed up in the rackets
and got what was coming.

623
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:09,286
That's a terrific story. We have
newspaper people on the payroll, right?

624
01:15:10,965 --> 01:15:14,754
- They might like a story like that.
- They might.

625
01:15:18,431 --> 01:15:21,924
It's not personal, Sonny.
It's strictly business.

626
01:15:25,021 --> 01:15:26,682
It's as cold as they come.

627
01:15:26,814 --> 01:15:30,227
Impossible to trace,
so you don't worry about prints.

628
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:34,398
I put a special tape on the trigger
and the butt. Try it.

629
01:15:46,834 --> 01:15:48,916
Is the trigger too tight?

630
01:15:52,089 --> 01:15:53,375
My ears!

631
01:15:53,466 --> 01:15:58,051
I left it noisy, so it scares away any
pain-in-the-ass innocent bystanders.

632
01:15:59,263 --> 01:16:02,096
You've shot them both.
Now what do you do?

633
01:16:04,602 --> 01:16:08,220
- Sit down, finish my dinner.
- Don't fool around.

634
01:16:08,314 --> 01:16:11,932
Let your hand drop to your side
and let the gun slip out.

635
01:16:12,068 --> 01:16:16,312
Everybody will still think you've got it.
They'll stare at your face,

636
01:16:16,447 --> 01:16:19,280
so walk out fast, but don't run.

637
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:22,901
Don't look anybody in the eye,
but don't look away either.

638
01:16:23,037 --> 01:16:26,405
They'll be scared stiff,
so don't worry about nothing.

639
01:16:28,459 --> 01:16:32,828
You'll be all right. You'll take
a vacation, nobody knows where,

640
01:16:32,922 --> 01:16:34,959
and we'll catch the hell.

641
01:16:35,508 --> 01:16:39,297
How bad do you think it will be?
- Pretty goddamn bad.

642
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:42,511
All the other families will probably
line up against us.

643
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:48,101
These things have to happen every five,
10 years. Gets rid of the had blood.

644
01:16:48,229 --> 01:16:52,769
Been 10 years since the last one.
You have to stop them at the beginning.

645
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:56,734
Like they should have stopped Hitler in
Munich, not letting him get away with it.

646
01:16:56,904 --> 01:16:58,440
They were just asking for big trouble.

647
01:17:00,074 --> 01:17:04,489
You know, Mike, we were all proud
of you. Being a hero and all.

648
01:17:04,578 --> 01:17:06,160
Your father too.

649
01:17:44,285 --> 01:17:47,778
Nothing. Not a hint. Absolutely nothing.

650
01:17:48,789 --> 01:17:53,033
Even Sollozzo's people don't know
where the meeting will be held.

651
01:17:53,169 --> 01:17:55,376
How much time do we have?

652
01:17:56,172 --> 01:18:01,212
They're going to pick you up outside
Jack Dempsey's in an hour and a half.

653
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:05,007
We could put a tail on them.

654
01:18:05,139 --> 01:18:07,005
Sollozzo would lose our ass.

655
01:18:08,225 --> 01:18:13,015
- What about the negotiator?
- He's playing pinochle with my men.

656
01:18:13,147 --> 01:18:17,937
- He's happy. They're letting him win.
- Too risky. Maybe we should call it off.

657
01:18:18,027 --> 01:18:21,565
The negotiator plays cards
until Mike is back safe.

658
01:18:21,655 --> 01:18:25,649
- He could blast whoever is in the car.
- They'll expect that.

659
01:18:25,784 --> 01:18:28,071
Sollozzo might not even be
in the car, Sonny!

660
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:30,657
I'll get it.

661
01:18:55,856 --> 01:18:58,063
Louis' restaurant in the Bronx.

662
01:18:58,150 --> 01:19:01,609
- Is it reliable?
- My man in McCluskey's precinct.

663
01:19:01,695 --> 01:19:07,281
A police captain is on call 24 hours
a day. He'll be there between 8 and 10.

664
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:12,245
- Anybody know this joint?
- Sure, I do. It's perfect for us.

665
01:19:12,373 --> 01:19:17,288
A small family place, good food.
Everyone minds his business. Perfect.

666
01:19:18,295 --> 01:19:23,210
They've got an old-fashioned toilet.
You know, the box and the chain thing.

667
01:19:25,219 --> 01:19:28,382
We might be able to
tape the gun behind it.

668
01:19:28,472 --> 01:19:32,636
All right. Mike, you go to the restaurant,

669
01:19:32,726 --> 01:19:36,594
you eat, talk for a while, you relax.
Make them relax.

670
01:19:36,689 --> 01:19:42,105
Then you go to take a leak. No,
better still, you ask permission to go.

671
01:19:42,236 --> 01:19:46,480
Then you come back blasting.
Two shots in the head apiece.

672
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,862
Miami somebody very good
to plant that gun.

673
01:19:50,953 --> 01:19:54,287
I don't want him coming out
with just his dick.

674
01:19:54,415 --> 01:20:00,127
- The gun will be there.
- You drive him and pick him up.

675
01:20:00,254 --> 01:20:01,744
Let's move.

676
01:20:07,386 --> 01:20:10,344
Did he tell you to drop the gun
right away?

677
01:20:10,472 --> 01:20:12,304
Yeah, a million times.

678
01:20:17,271 --> 01:20:21,265
Don't forget. Two shots apiece
in the head as soon as you come out.

679
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:31,483
How long do you think it will be
before I can come back?

680
01:20:32,328 --> 01:20:34,490
At least a year.

681
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:39,325
I'll square it with Mom, that you're not
seeing her before you leave and...

682
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:44,420
I'll get a message to that girlfriend
when the time is right.

683
01:20:50,554 --> 01:20:52,170
Take care.

684
01:20:54,933 --> 01:20:56,594
Take care, Mike.

685
01:21:29,301 --> 01:21:33,295
I'm glad you came. I hope
we can straighten everything out.

686
01:21:34,390 --> 01:21:39,601
It's not the way I wanted things to go.
It should never have happened.

687
01:21:39,728 --> 01:21:44,017
I want to straighten everything out.
I don't want my father bothered again.

688
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:47,437
I swear on my children
that he won't be, Mike.

689
01:21:48,445 --> 01:21:51,608
But you have to keep an open mind
when we talk.

690
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:56,234
I hope you're not a hothead like Sonny.
You can't talk business with him.

691
01:21:58,080 --> 01:21:59,616
He's a good kid.

692
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:07,245
I'm sorry about the other night, Mike.

693
01:22:07,381 --> 01:22:11,466
I've got to frisk you, so turn around.
On your knees, facing me.

694
01:22:16,348 --> 01:22:21,184
I guess I'm getting too old for my job.
Too grouchy.

695
01:22:22,438 --> 01:22:26,477
Can't stand the aggravation.
You know how it is.

696
01:22:28,485 --> 01:22:29,691
He's clean.

697
01:22:56,638 --> 01:22:58,925
Going to Jersey?

698
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:03,050
Maybe.

699
01:23:28,337 --> 01:23:30,123
Nice work, Lou.

700
01:24:07,292 --> 01:24:12,753
- How's the food in this restaurant?
- Try the veal. It's the best in the city.

701
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:14,622
I'll have it.

702
01:24:50,127 --> 01:24:53,370
- I'm going to speak Italian to Mikey.
- Go ahead.

703
01:26:12,876 --> 01:26:14,708
What I want...

704
01:26:15,671 --> 01:26:17,628
What's most important to me

705
01:26:20,509 --> 01:26:24,594
is that I have a guarantee.
No more attempts on my father's life.

706
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:29,641
What guarantees can I give you?
I'm the hunted one!

707
01:26:29,726 --> 01:26:33,185
I missed my chance.
You think too much of me, kid.

708
01:26:33,271 --> 01:26:35,057
I'm not that clever.

709
01:26:36,608 --> 01:26:38,770
All I want is a truce.

710
01:26:45,283 --> 01:26:49,072
I have to go to the bathroom.
Is it all right?

711
01:26:50,706 --> 01:26:53,289
When you got to go, you got to go.

712
01:26:58,505 --> 01:27:00,087
He's clean.

713
01:27:00,716 --> 01:27:02,582
Don't take too long.

714
01:27:05,721 --> 01:27:07,678
I've frisked a thousand punks.

715
01:31:58,263 --> 01:32:00,174
Okay, you take over.

716
01:32:17,574 --> 01:32:19,360
I love you, Grandpa.

717
01:32:22,203 --> 01:32:24,911
I'm sorry, Pa.
He doesn't know you yet.

718
01:32:26,332 --> 01:32:29,495
- Hey, big guy. Give it to Grandpa.
- Okay.

719
01:32:29,586 --> 01:32:35,923
"I hope you get well, Grandpa, and wish
I see you soon. Your grandson Frank."

720
01:32:38,845 --> 01:32:41,007
Go with your mother.

721
01:32:41,139 --> 01:32:43,301
Take them downstairs.

722
01:32:49,397 --> 01:32:51,434
Go on, Carlo, you too.

723
01:32:53,151 --> 01:32:55,017
Go on.

724
01:33:15,465 --> 01:33:19,459
- What's the matter with you, Carlo?
- Shut up and set the table.

725
01:33:34,984 --> 01:33:41,026
Since McCluskey's killing, the police
have cracked down on our operations.

726
01:33:42,909 --> 01:33:47,824
And also the other families.
There's been a lot of bad blood.

727
01:33:47,914 --> 01:33:51,248
They hit us, so we hit them back.

728
01:33:52,043 --> 01:33:56,788
Through our newspaper contacts
we've been able to put out material

729
01:33:56,881 --> 01:34:01,000
about McCluskey's link with Sollozzo
in the drug rackets.

730
01:34:01,094 --> 01:34:03,256
So things are loosening up.

731
01:34:04,597 --> 01:34:09,262
And I'm sending Fredo to Las Vegas,

732
01:34:09,394 --> 01:34:12,102
under the protection
of Don Francesco of L.A.

733
01:34:12,230 --> 01:34:16,599
- I want him to rest.
- I'm going to learn the casino business.

734
01:34:24,951 --> 01:34:26,692
Where's Michael?

735
01:34:39,132 --> 01:34:42,045
It was Michael who killed Sollozzo.

736
01:34:44,053 --> 01:34:47,842
But he's safe. We're starting to work
to bring him back.

737
01:35:09,078 --> 01:35:11,558
I want you to find out
where that old pimp Tattaglia is hiding.

738
01:35:11,664 --> 01:35:13,575
I want him now.

739
01:35:13,708 --> 01:35:17,121
Sonny, things are starting to loosen up.

740
01:35:17,253 --> 01:35:22,123
If you go after Tattaglia, all hell
will break loose. Pop can negotiate.

741
01:35:22,217 --> 01:35:28,133
He must get better first. I'll decide...
- War is costly. We can't do business.

742
01:35:28,223 --> 01:35:32,182
- Neither can they. Don't worry about it!
- We can't afford a stalemate.

743
01:35:32,310 --> 01:35:37,225
- No more stalemate. I'll kill the bastard!
- You're getting a great reputation!

744
01:35:37,357 --> 01:35:43,148
Do as I say! If I had a Sicilian wartime
<i>consigliere,</i> I wouldn't be in this shape!

745
01:35:43,279 --> 01:35:45,566
Pop had Genco. Look what I got.

746
01:35:49,118 --> 01:35:51,485
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

747
01:35:52,622 --> 01:35:55,580
Ma made a little dinner. It's Sunday.

748
01:35:56,542 --> 01:36:01,002
Niggers are having a good time
with our policy banks in Harlem.

749
01:36:01,130 --> 01:36:05,089
Driving new Cadillacs,
paying 50% on a bet.

750
01:36:05,176 --> 01:36:08,589
That's because
they've started making big money.

751
01:36:08,721 --> 01:36:12,055
Papa never talked business
at the table.

752
01:36:12,183 --> 01:36:16,017
- Shut up, Connie...
- Don't you ever tell her to shut up.

753
01:36:16,729 --> 01:36:17,764
Don't interfere.

754
01:36:20,191 --> 01:36:24,105
I'd like to talk to you after dinner.
I could do more for the family...

755
01:36:24,195 --> 01:36:26,937
We don't discuss business at the table.

756
01:37:14,203 --> 01:37:16,661
I kiss your hand, Don Tommasino.

757
01:37:22,420 --> 01:37:24,411
Why are you so far
from the house?

758
01:37:24,964 --> 01:37:27,581
You know I'm responsible to your
father for your life.

759
01:37:27,675 --> 01:37:29,040
The bodyguards are here.

760
01:37:29,886 --> 01:37:31,968
It's still dangerous...

761
01:37:32,263 --> 01:37:35,381
We've heard from Santino
in New York...

762
01:37:35,475 --> 01:37:37,762
Your enemies know you're here.

763
01:37:38,895 --> 01:37:42,229
Did Santino say when
I can go back?

764
01:37:42,315 --> 01:37:43,976
Not yet.

765
01:37:44,275 --> 01:37:46,061
It's out of the question.

766
01:37:49,405 --> 01:37:50,895
Where are you going now?

767
01:37:52,450 --> 01:37:53,565
To Corleone.

768
01:37:54,327 --> 01:37:55,408
Take my car.

769
01:37:58,831 --> 01:37:59,866
I want to walk.

770
01:38:02,668 --> 01:38:03,829
Be careful.

771
01:38:23,940 --> 01:38:25,522
Michael. Corleone.

772
01:38:38,246 --> 01:38:39,846
Where have all the men gone?

773
01:38:40,540 --> 01:38:42,827
They're all dead from vendettas.

774
01:38:44,335 --> 01:38:46,827
There are the names of the dead.

775
01:39:03,354 --> 01:39:07,268
Hey, hey, take me to the America, G.I.!

776
01:39:07,358 --> 01:39:11,773
Hey, hey, take me to the America, G.I.!
Clark Gable!

777
01:39:11,904 --> 01:39:17,195
America! Take me to the America, G.I.!
Clark Gable, Rita Hayworth!

778
01:39:35,052 --> 01:39:37,168
Mamma mia what a beauty.

779
01:39:45,396 --> 01:39:48,479
I think you got hit
by the thunderbolt.

780
01:39:54,447 --> 01:39:58,441
In Sicily women are more
dangerous than shotguns.

781
01:40:21,849 --> 01:40:23,465
Did you have a good hunt?

782
01:40:24,477 --> 01:40:26,639
You know all the girls
around here?

783
01:40:27,313 --> 01:40:28,678
We saw some real beauties.

784
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:33,058
One of them struck our friend
like a thunderbolt.

785
01:40:36,405 --> 01:40:39,067
She would tempt the devil himself.

786
01:40:46,624 --> 01:40:48,831
Really put together.

787
01:40:48,918 --> 01:40:49,999
Right, Calo?

788
01:40:53,673 --> 01:40:55,664
Such hair, such mouth!

789
01:40:58,094 --> 01:41:01,337
The girls around here are
beautiful... but virtuous.

790
01:41:01,806 --> 01:41:04,264
This one had a purple dress...

791
01:41:04,475 --> 01:41:06,637
And a purple ribbon in her hair.

792
01:41:07,478 --> 01:41:10,687
A type more Greek than Italian.

793
01:41:13,234 --> 01:41:14,645
Do you know her?

794
01:41:19,532 --> 01:41:22,274
There's no girl like that
in this town.

795
01:41:24,912 --> 01:41:26,152
My God, I understand!

796
01:41:30,293 --> 01:41:31,328
What's wrong?

797
01:41:33,546 --> 01:41:34,832
Let's go.

798
01:41:36,716 --> 01:41:38,081
It's his daughter.

799
01:41:38,676 --> 01:41:40,041
Tell him to come here.

800
01:41:43,514 --> 01:41:44,675
Call him.

801
01:42:04,744 --> 01:42:07,156
Fabrizio, you translate.

802
01:42:11,334 --> 01:42:12,995
I apologize if I offended you.

803
01:42:14,295 --> 01:42:17,504
I'm a stranger in this country.

804
01:42:17,590 --> 01:42:20,708
I meant no disrespect
to you or your daughter.

805
01:42:26,307 --> 01:42:29,140
I'm an American, hiding in Sicily.

806
01:42:30,645 --> 01:42:32,761
My name is Michael Corleone.

807
01:42:34,857 --> 01:42:38,976
There are people who'd pay
a lot of money for that information.

808
01:42:41,197 --> 01:42:44,315
But then your daughter
would lose a father

809
01:42:45,743 --> 01:42:48,235
instead of gaining a husband.

810
01:42:56,420 --> 01:42:58,707
I want to meet your daughter.

811
01:42:59,298 --> 01:43:03,758
With your permission, and under
the supervision of your family.

812
01:43:04,595 --> 01:43:06,177
With all respect.

813
01:43:12,228 --> 01:43:16,267
Come to my house
Sunday morning. My name is Vitelli.

814
01:43:21,654 --> 01:43:23,270
What's her name?

815
01:43:24,782 --> 01:43:26,193
Apollonia.

816
01:46:18,664 --> 01:46:20,871
I'll knock you dizzy.

817
01:46:26,547 --> 01:46:28,709
Save it for the library.

818
01:46:32,303 --> 01:46:34,840
We've got to pick up my sister.

819
01:46:52,907 --> 01:46:54,773
What's the matter?

820
01:46:57,119 --> 01:46:58,905
What's the matter?

821
01:47:00,873 --> 01:47:02,739
- It was my fault!
- Where is he?

822
01:47:02,875 --> 01:47:05,867
It was my fault. I hit him.

823
01:47:05,961 --> 01:47:09,920
I started a fight with him.
I hit him, so he hit me...

824
01:47:14,929 --> 01:47:18,342
I'm just going to get a doctor
to take a look at you.

825
01:47:18,474 --> 01:47:21,011
Sonny, please don't do anything.

826
01:47:22,978 --> 01:47:24,938
What's the matter with you?
What am I going to do?

827
01:47:24,980 --> 01:47:28,018
Make that baby an orphan
before he's born?

828
01:47:32,488 --> 01:47:35,776
You spic slobs still betting Yankees?

829
01:47:35,908 --> 01:47:37,774
Tell them to stop taking in action.

830
01:47:39,286 --> 01:47:40,868
We lost enough money last week.

831
01:47:48,003 --> 01:47:50,085
Come here, come here!

832
01:48:46,979 --> 01:48:50,438
If you touch my sister again,
I'll kill you.

833
01:52:43,674 --> 01:52:47,963
Hey! We weren't expecting you, Kay.
You should call.

834
01:52:48,095 --> 01:52:52,259
Yes, I have.
I've tried writing and calling.

835
01:52:52,349 --> 01:52:56,138
- I want to reach Michael.
Nobody knows where he is.

836
01:52:56,270 --> 01:52:58,932
All we know is that he's all right.

837
01:53:01,358 --> 01:53:05,147
- What was that?
- An accident, but nobody was hurt.

838
01:53:06,321 --> 01:53:10,155
Tom, will you give this letter to Michael.
Please?

839
01:53:11,827 --> 01:53:17,118
If I accepted that, a court could prove
I have knowledge of his whereabouts.

840
01:53:18,041 --> 01:53:19,952
He'll get in touch with you.

841
01:53:20,043 --> 01:53:23,707
I let my cab go,
so can I call another one, please?

842
01:53:23,797 --> 01:53:25,583
Come on. Sorry.

843
01:53:42,941 --> 01:53:47,435
<i>- Hello?
- Is Carla there?</i>

844
01:53:48,196 --> 01:53:50,813
- Who is this?
- <i>A friend of Carlo.</i>

845
01:53:50,949 --> 01:53:54,408
<i>Tell him that I can't make it tonight
untll later.</i>

846
01:54:00,042 --> 01:54:01,407
Bitch!

847
01:54:03,420 --> 01:54:06,162
- Dinner's on the table.
- I'm not hungry.

848
01:54:06,256 --> 01:54:09,419
- The food is getting cold.
- I'll eat out later.

849
01:54:09,551 --> 01:54:13,010
- You just told me to make you dinner!
- <i>Vafangool!</i>

850
01:54:13,263 --> 01:54:15,425
I'll <i>vafangool</i> you!

851
01:54:20,228 --> 01:54:22,970
She has a filthy mouth, this Guinea brat.

852
01:54:27,319 --> 01:54:31,563
That's it, break it all,
you spoiled Guinea brat. Break it all!

853
01:54:40,832 --> 01:54:43,995
Why don't you bring
your whore home for dinner?

854
01:54:45,003 --> 01:54:46,585
Maybe I will.

855
01:54:53,261 --> 01:54:56,470
- Clean it up!
- Like hell I will!

856
01:54:56,598 --> 01:55:00,466
You skinny, spoiled brat.
Clean it up! Clean it up!

857
01:55:00,602 --> 01:55:05,142
Clean it up! I said, clean it up!
Clean it up!

858
01:55:05,315 --> 01:55:10,105
Clean it up. Clean that up, you...

859
01:55:13,365 --> 01:55:15,072
Clean it!

860
01:55:15,158 --> 01:55:19,447
Clean it up! Yeah, kill me.
Be a murderer, like your father!

861
01:55:19,538 --> 01:55:22,872
- All you Corleones are murderers!
- I hate you!

862
01:55:23,041 --> 01:55:24,657
Come on, kill me!

863
01:55:26,336 --> 01:55:27,918
Get out of here!

864
01:55:28,046 --> 01:55:31,289
- I hate you!
- Now I'll kill you.

865
01:55:31,425 --> 01:55:34,258
You Guinea brat. Get out of here!

866
01:55:44,563 --> 01:55:47,521
Connie, what's the matter?
I can't hear you.

867
01:55:48,692 --> 01:55:51,730
Connie, talk louder. The baby's crying.

868
01:55:51,862 --> 01:55:54,399
Santino, I can't understand.
I don't know.

869
01:55:56,116 --> 01:55:57,777
Yeah, Connie.

870
01:56:02,456 --> 01:56:04,413
You wait there.

871
01:56:07,169 --> 01:56:09,627
No, you just wait there.

872
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:14,127
Son-of-a-bitch.

873
01:56:14,259 --> 01:56:17,468
- Son-of-a-bitch!
- What's the matter?

874
01:56:21,433 --> 01:56:24,516
Open the goddamn gate!
Get off your ass.

875
01:56:32,527 --> 01:56:33,858
Sonny!

876
01:56:40,410 --> 01:56:42,401
- Sonny.
- Get out of here!

877
01:56:43,538 --> 01:56:45,370
Go after him, go on!

878
01:57:15,028 --> 01:57:17,019
Son-of-a-bitch. Come on!

879
01:59:05,680 --> 01:59:07,717
Give me a drop.

880
01:59:16,066 --> 01:59:18,353
My wife is crying upstairs.

881
01:59:20,612 --> 01:59:23,274
I hear cars coming to the house.

882
01:59:27,827 --> 01:59:30,694
<i>Consigliere</i> of mine,

883
01:59:30,830 --> 01:59:34,448
tell your Don
what everyone seems to know.

884
01:59:34,542 --> 01:59:36,749
I didn't tell Mama anything.

885
01:59:37,712 --> 01:59:41,046
I was about to come up and wake you
and tell you.

886
01:59:44,678 --> 01:59:46,669
But you needed a drink first.

887
01:59:49,099 --> 01:59:50,385
Yeah.

888
01:59:53,770 --> 01:59:56,137
Well, now you've had your drink.

889
02:00:01,569 --> 02:00:05,688
They shot Sonny on the causeway.
He's dead.

890
02:00:22,757 --> 02:00:25,169
I want no inquiries made.

891
02:00:29,764 --> 02:00:32,176
I want no acts of vengeance.

892
02:00:33,810 --> 02:00:36,598
I want you to arrange a meeting

893
02:00:37,605 --> 02:00:40,393
with the heads of the five families.

894
02:00:42,318 --> 02:00:44,400
This war stops now.

895
02:01:06,342 --> 02:01:08,754
Call Bonasera.

896
02:01:08,887 --> 02:01:11,094
I need him now.

897
02:01:23,568 --> 02:01:28,779
This is Tom Hagen. I'm calling
for Vito Corleone, at his request.

898
02:01:28,865 --> 02:01:31,152
You owe your Don a service.

899
02:01:31,242 --> 02:01:34,735
<i>He has no doubt that you will repay it.</i>

900
02:01:34,829 --> 02:01:39,198
<i>He will be at your funeral parlor
in one hour. Be there to greet him.</i>

901
02:02:00,438 --> 02:02:05,183
Well, my friend, are you ready
to do me this service?

902
02:02:05,276 --> 02:02:08,394
Yes. What do you want me to do?

903
02:02:16,830 --> 02:02:21,199
I want you to use all your powers
and all your skills.

904
02:02:25,421 --> 02:02:28,334
I don't want his mother
to see him this way.

905
02:02:44,399 --> 02:02:47,482
Look how they massacred my boy.

906
02:03:16,556 --> 02:03:19,924
It's safer to teach you English!

907
02:03:20,518 --> 02:03:21,849
I know English...

908
02:03:21,936 --> 02:03:26,931
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday,
Wednesday, Friday, Sunday, Saturday.

909
02:03:33,907 --> 02:03:35,898
Greetings, Don Tommasino.

910
02:03:36,534 --> 02:03:38,525
How are things in Palermo?

911
02:03:44,584 --> 02:03:48,669
Michael is teaching me to
drive... watch, I'll show you.

912
02:03:51,341 --> 02:03:53,127
How are things in Palermo?

913
02:03:53,676 --> 02:03:56,794
Young people don't respect
anything anymore...

914
02:03:57,889 --> 02:04:01,098
times are changing for the worse.

915
02:04:03,394 --> 02:04:06,932
This place has become
too dangerous for you.

916
02:04:09,567 --> 02:04:14,812
I want you to move to a villa
near Siracusa... right now.

917
02:04:20,787 --> 02:04:21,948
What's wrong?

918
02:04:22,914 --> 02:04:25,155
Bad news from America.

919
02:04:27,752 --> 02:04:31,416
Your brother, Santino,
they killed him.

920
02:04:37,887 --> 02:04:39,924
Let's go... you promised.

921
02:04:58,658 --> 02:04:59,739
Fabrizio!

922
02:04:59,826 --> 02:05:01,032
Get the car.

923
02:05:02,537 --> 02:05:06,747
Are you driving yourself, Boss?
Is your wife coming with you?

924
02:05:06,833 --> 02:05:10,042
No, take her to her father's house
until things are safe.

925
02:05:10,420 --> 02:05:12,331
Okay, anything you say.

926
02:05:18,261 --> 02:05:19,922
Calo, where is Apollonia?

927
02:05:20,847 --> 02:05:24,260
She's going to surprise you.
She wants to drive.

928
02:05:26,602 --> 02:05:28,684
She'll make a good American wife.

929
02:05:29,981 --> 02:05:32,643
Wait, I'll get the baggage.

930
02:05:42,994 --> 02:05:44,951
Fabrizio!

931
02:05:45,121 --> 02:05:46,907
Where are you going?

932
02:05:48,499 --> 02:05:50,991
Wait there! I'll drive to you.

933
02:05:56,966 --> 02:05:58,582
No, Apollonia!

934
02:06:21,532 --> 02:06:27,403
Don Barzini, I want to thank you
for helping me organize this meeting,

935
02:06:27,497 --> 02:06:32,242
and the other heads of the five families
from New York and New Jersey.

936
02:06:34,003 --> 02:06:37,166
Carmine Cuneo from the Bronx,

937
02:06:37,256 --> 02:06:40,624
and from Brooklyn

938
02:06:42,220 --> 02:06:44,302
Philip Tattaglia.

939
02:06:46,015 --> 02:06:48,928
And from Staten Island

940
02:06:49,060 --> 02:06:52,394
we have with us Victor Strachi.

941
02:06:52,480 --> 02:06:58,021
And the other associates that came as
far as from California and Kansas City

942
02:06:58,194 --> 02:07:02,062
and all the other territories
of the country. Thank you.

943
02:07:08,871 --> 02:07:12,205
How did things ever get so far?

944
02:07:12,291 --> 02:07:14,077
I don't know.

945
02:07:16,129 --> 02:07:19,497
It was so unfortunate, so unnecessary.

946
02:07:22,677 --> 02:07:26,011
Tattaglia lost a son, and I lost a son.

947
02:07:28,516 --> 02:07:32,054
We're quits. And if Tattaglia agrees,

948
02:07:32,145 --> 02:07:36,139
then I'm willing to let things go on
as before.

949
02:07:37,483 --> 02:07:41,021
We're grateful to Don Corleone
for calling this meeting.

950
02:07:41,112 --> 02:07:46,653
We all know him as a man of his word.
A modest man who listens to reason.

951
02:07:46,742 --> 02:07:50,861
Yes, Don Barzini. He's too modest.

952
02:07:50,955 --> 02:07:54,994
He had all the judges and politicians
in his pocket.

953
02:07:55,084 --> 02:07:57,951
He refused to share them.

954
02:07:58,045 --> 02:08:02,004
When did I ever refuse
an accommodation?

955
02:08:02,133 --> 02:08:04,295
All of you know me.

956
02:08:05,261 --> 02:08:10,472
When did I ever refuse,
except one time? And Why?

957
02:08:12,059 --> 02:08:18,101
Because I believe this drug business
will destroy us in the years to come.

958
02:08:18,191 --> 02:08:22,276
It's not like gambling or liquor
or even women,

959
02:08:22,361 --> 02:08:28,357
which is something that most people
want, but is forbidden by the Church.

960
02:08:28,492 --> 02:08:33,077
Even the police that have helped us in
the past with gambling and other things

961
02:08:33,164 --> 02:08:37,499
are going to refuse to help us
when it comes to narcotics.

962
02:08:37,585 --> 02:08:42,705
I believed that then
and I believe that now.

963
02:08:42,798 --> 02:08:45,130
Times have changed.

964
02:08:45,218 --> 02:08:49,928
It's not like the old days,
when we could do anything we wanted.

965
02:08:50,014 --> 02:08:52,847
A refusal is not the act of a friend.

966
02:08:52,975 --> 02:08:58,220
If Don Corleone had all the judges and
politicians, then he must share them

967
02:08:58,356 --> 02:09:03,066
or let others use them. He must let us
draw the water from the well.

968
02:09:04,153 --> 02:09:07,646
Certainly he can present a bill
for such services.

969
02:09:07,782 --> 02:09:10,240
After all, we're not communists.

970
02:09:13,371 --> 02:09:16,580
I also don't believe in drugs.

971
02:09:16,666 --> 02:09:21,251
For years I paid my people extra, so
they wouldn't do that kind of business.

972
02:09:21,587 --> 02:09:24,750
Somebody says to them
"I have powders."

973
02:09:24,840 --> 02:09:28,253
"If you put up
3-4,000 dollar investment,

974
02:09:28,386 --> 02:09:30,969
we can make 50,000 distributing."

975
02:09:32,223 --> 02:09:38,219
They can't resist. I want to control it
as a business, keep it respectable.

976
02:09:38,354 --> 02:09:43,099
I don't want it near schools,
I don't want it sold to children.

977
02:09:43,192 --> 02:09:45,183
That's an <i>infàmia.</i>

978
02:09:46,362 --> 02:09:50,230
In my city we would keep the traffic
to the colored.

979
02:09:50,366 --> 02:09:53,575
They're animals,
so let them lose their souls.

980
02:10:00,334 --> 02:10:03,827
I hoped that we could come here
and reason together.

981
02:10:05,339 --> 02:10:11,881
And I'm willing to do whatever is
necessary to find a peaceful solution.

982
02:10:12,388 --> 02:10:17,053
We are agreed. The traffic in drugs
will be permitted, but controlled.

983
02:10:17,143 --> 02:10:21,307
Don Corleone will give us protection
in the east, and there will be peace.

984
02:10:21,439 --> 02:10:25,103
I must have strict assurance
from Corleone.

985
02:10:25,192 --> 02:10:28,605
As time goes by
and his position becomes stronger,

986
02:10:28,696 --> 02:10:31,233
will he attempt any individual vendetta?

987
02:10:31,324 --> 02:10:36,535
We are all reasonable men.
We don't have to give assurances.

988
02:10:36,662 --> 02:10:39,495
You talk about vengeance.

989
02:10:39,623 --> 02:10:42,911
Will vengeance
bring your son back to you?

990
02:10:43,044 --> 02:10:45,411
Or my boy to me?

991
02:10:45,504 --> 02:10:48,246
I forgo the vengeance of my son.

992
02:10:51,260 --> 02:10:53,422
But I have selfish reasons.

993
02:10:55,723 --> 02:10:59,216
My youngest son was forced
to leave this country

994
02:11:01,270 --> 02:11:03,728
because of this Sollozzo business.

995
02:11:05,232 --> 02:11:09,021
And I have to make arrangements
to bring him back here safely.

996
02:11:09,320 --> 02:11:11,982
Cleared of all these false charges.

997
02:11:13,282 --> 02:11:16,525
But I'm a superstitious man.

998
02:11:16,660 --> 02:11:21,951
If an unlucky accident should befall him,
if he should be shot by a police officer,

999
02:11:23,250 --> 02:11:26,959
or if he should hang himself
in his jail cell,

1000
02:11:27,088 --> 02:11:29,876
or if he's struck by a bolt of lightning,

1001
02:11:31,217 --> 02:11:34,710
then I'm going to blame
some of the people in this room.

1002
02:11:36,263 --> 02:11:38,675
And that I do not forgive.

1003
02:11:41,310 --> 02:11:43,517
But, that aside,

1004
02:11:46,607 --> 02:11:49,099
let me say that I swear

1005
02:11:50,528 --> 02:11:53,691
on the souls of my grandchildren,

1006
02:11:53,864 --> 02:11:58,279
that I will not be the one to break
the peace we've made here today.

1007
02:12:23,686 --> 02:12:29,272
Should I insist that all of Tattaglia's
drug middlemen have clean records?

1008
02:12:29,358 --> 02:12:31,474
Mention it. Don't insist.

1009
02:12:33,487 --> 02:12:38,357
- Barzini will know without being told.
- You mean Tattaglia.

1010
02:12:39,910 --> 02:12:41,867
Tattaglia's a pimp.

1011
02:12:42,955 --> 02:12:46,118
He could never have outfought Santino.

1012
02:12:48,335 --> 02:12:54,081
But I didn't know until this day
that it was Barzini all along.

1013
02:13:09,398 --> 02:13:11,514
Come on, Nancy.

1014
02:13:12,776 --> 02:13:15,518
Keep together, everyone. Brian.

1015
02:13:16,697 --> 02:13:18,529
Okay, all right.

1016
02:13:31,337 --> 02:13:33,578
How long have you been back?

1017
02:13:34,340 --> 02:13:36,377
I've been back a year.

1018
02:13:37,635 --> 02:13:39,797
Longer than that, I think.

1019
02:13:42,598 --> 02:13:44,805
It's good to see you, Kay.

1020
02:13:55,819 --> 02:13:58,481
I'm working for my father now, Kay.

1021
02:14:00,866 --> 02:14:03,858
He's been sick. Very sick.

1022
02:14:05,579 --> 02:14:07,490
But you're not like him.

1023
02:14:07,623 --> 02:14:11,366
You told me you weren't going to
become like your father.

1024
02:14:13,295 --> 02:14:17,414
My father is no different
than any other powerful man.

1025
02:14:17,550 --> 02:14:21,168
Any man who's responsible
for other people.

1026
02:14:22,388 --> 02:14:24,675
Like a senator or president.

1027
02:14:24,807 --> 02:14:27,390
- How naive you sound.
- Why?

1028
02:14:27,476 --> 02:14:30,218
They don't have men killed.

1029
02:14:33,482 --> 02:14:35,473
Who's being naive, Kay?

1030
02:14:36,610 --> 02:14:40,899
My father's way of doing things is over.
Even he knows that.

1031
02:14:42,616 --> 02:14:46,826
In five years the Corleone family
is going to be completely legitimate.

1032
02:14:48,622 --> 02:14:52,581
Trust me. That's all I can tell you
about my business. Kay...

1033
02:14:54,086 --> 02:14:57,249
Michael, why did you come here? Why?

1034
02:14:58,424 --> 02:15:03,464
What do you want with me after all
this time? I've been calling and writing.

1035
02:15:03,554 --> 02:15:06,922
I came because I need you.
I care for you.

1036
02:15:07,057 --> 02:15:10,846
- Please stop it, Michael.
- Because... I want you to marry me.

1037
02:15:12,438 --> 02:15:15,226
- It's too late.
- Please, Kay...

1038
02:15:16,859 --> 02:15:20,727
I'll do anything you ask
to make up for what's happened to us.

1039
02:15:22,531 --> 02:15:26,866
Because that's important, Kay.
Because what's important is that

1040
02:15:28,537 --> 02:15:31,620
we have each other.
That we have a life together.

1041
02:15:33,334 --> 02:15:35,951
That we have children. Our children.

1042
02:15:37,588 --> 02:15:39,545
Kay, I need you.

1043
02:15:41,508 --> 02:15:43,249
And I love you.

1044
02:16:05,366 --> 02:16:09,155
Barzini's people chisel
my territory and we do nothing about it!

1045
02:16:09,286 --> 02:16:12,779
- Soon I'll have no place to hang my hat!
- Be patient.

1046
02:16:12,915 --> 02:16:16,078
I'm not asking for help.
Just take off the handcuffs.

1047
02:16:16,168 --> 02:16:19,331
- Be patient.
- We must protect ourselves.

1048
02:16:19,421 --> 02:16:22,755
- Let me recruit some new men.
- No.

1049
02:16:22,883 --> 02:16:26,717
- Barzini would get an excuse to fight.
- Mike, you're wrong.

1050
02:16:28,305 --> 02:16:30,546
Don Corleone...

1051
02:16:30,683 --> 02:16:34,517
You once said that one day Tessio
and me could form our own family.

1052
02:16:34,645 --> 02:16:38,684
Till today I would never think of it.
I must ask your permission.

1053
02:16:39,692 --> 02:16:42,559
Michael is now head of the family.

1054
02:16:42,695 --> 02:16:46,734
If he gives his permission,
then you have my blessing.

1055
02:16:46,865 --> 02:16:49,357
After we make the move to Nevada

1056
02:16:49,493 --> 02:16:53,703
you can leave the Corleone family
and go on your own.

1057
02:16:53,789 --> 02:16:58,204
- How long will that be?
- Six months.

1058
02:16:58,335 --> 02:17:01,418
Forgive me, but with you gone,

1059
02:17:01,505 --> 02:17:04,543
me and Pete
will come under Barzini's thumb.

1060
02:17:04,633 --> 02:17:10,219
I hate that Barzini. In six months' time
there will be nothing left to build on.

1061
02:17:10,347 --> 02:17:13,214
- Do you have faith in my judgment?
- Yes.

1062
02:17:13,350 --> 02:17:16,217
- Do I have your loyalty?
- Always, Godfather.

1063
02:17:16,395 --> 02:17:19,729
Then be a friend to Michael.
Do as he says.

1064
02:17:24,570 --> 02:17:29,781
Things are negotiated that'll solve your
problems and answer your questions.

1065
02:17:29,908 --> 02:17:32,240
That's all I can tell you now.

1066
02:17:33,036 --> 02:17:35,573
Carlo, you grew up in Nevada.

1067
02:17:35,706 --> 02:17:39,119
When we make our move there,
you'll be my right-hand man.

1068
02:17:39,209 --> 02:17:43,954
Tom Hagen is no longer <i>consigliere.</i>
He'll be our lawyer in Vegas.

1069
02:17:44,047 --> 02:17:46,630
That's no reflection on Tom,
just how I want it.

1070
02:17:46,759 --> 02:17:51,469
If I ever need help, who's a better
<i>consigliere</i> than my father? That's it.

1071
02:18:11,533 --> 02:18:15,322
- Thank you, Papa.
- I'm happy for you, Carlo.

1072
02:18:15,412 --> 02:18:18,245
Mike... Why am I out?

1073
02:18:19,625 --> 02:18:22,583
You're not a wartime <i>consigliere,</i> Tom.

1074
02:18:23,712 --> 02:18:27,000
Things may get rough with the move.

1075
02:18:27,132 --> 02:18:28,463
Tom.

1076
02:18:33,680 --> 02:18:38,641
I advised Michael. I never thought
you were a bad <i>consigliere.</i>

1077
02:18:38,769 --> 02:18:42,933
I thought Santino was a bad Don,
rest in peace.

1078
02:18:44,483 --> 02:18:47,771
Michael has all my confidence,
just as you do.

1079
02:18:48,695 --> 02:18:53,690
But there are reasons why you must
have no part in what is going to happen.

1080
02:18:54,785 --> 02:18:57,823
Maybe I could help.
- You're out, Tom.

1081
02:19:46,879 --> 02:19:51,294
I can't get over the way your face looks.
So good!

1082
02:19:51,425 --> 02:19:55,840
This doctor did some job.
Did Kay talk you into it? Hey, hey, hey!

1083
02:19:55,929 --> 02:20:00,093
Leave them out here.
He's tired and wants to clean up.

1084
02:20:00,225 --> 02:20:02,637
Let me open the door, all right?

1085
02:20:08,859 --> 02:20:14,150
- Hello, Mike! Welcome to Las Vegas!
- All for you, kid! It's all his idea.

1086
02:20:14,281 --> 02:20:16,739
- Your brother Freddy.
- Girls?

1087
02:20:20,704 --> 02:20:23,742
I'll be right back. Keep them occupied.

1088
02:20:25,083 --> 02:20:28,701
- Anything you want, kid, anything.
- Who are the girls?

1089
02:20:29,963 --> 02:20:33,456
- That's for you to find out.
Get rid of them, Fredo.

1090
02:20:34,885 --> 02:20:39,721
- Hey, Mike...
- I'm here on business. Get rid of them.

1091
02:20:39,806 --> 02:20:42,389
I'm tired. Get rid of the band too.

1092
02:20:48,273 --> 02:20:51,265
Hey, take off. Take off. Let's go.

1093
02:20:51,735 --> 02:20:53,817
Hey, that's it. Hey, Angelo.

1094
02:20:55,530 --> 02:20:57,612
Hey, come on! Scram!

1095
02:20:59,284 --> 02:21:02,743
Come on, honey. I don't know
what's the matter with him, Johnny.

1096
02:21:02,871 --> 02:21:04,236
Sorry.

1097
02:21:06,124 --> 02:21:08,786
I don't know. He's tired.

1098
02:21:15,801 --> 02:21:18,668
What happened to Moe Greene?

1099
02:21:18,762 --> 02:21:23,222
He had some business. He said to
give him a call when the party started.

1100
02:21:23,350 --> 02:21:25,216
Well, give him a call.

1101
02:21:26,645 --> 02:21:29,854
- Johnny, how are you?
- Nice to see you, Mike.

1102
02:21:29,982 --> 02:21:31,973
- We're proud of you.
- Thanks.

1103
02:21:32,109 --> 02:21:35,852
Sit down, I want to talk to you.
The Don is proud too.

1104
02:21:35,988 --> 02:21:37,979
Well, I owe it all to him.

1105
02:21:39,199 --> 02:21:40,860
He knows how grateful you are.

1106
02:21:40,951 --> 02:21:44,160
That's why
he'd like to ask a favor of you.

1107
02:21:44,246 --> 02:21:46,157
Mike, what can I do?

1108
02:21:47,374 --> 02:21:49,911
We're thinking of giving up our interests

1109
02:21:50,043 --> 02:21:52,876
in the olive oil business
and settling here.

1110
02:21:53,672 --> 02:21:58,917
Moe will sell us his share of the casino
and the hotel, so we'll own all of it.

1111
02:21:59,011 --> 02:22:01,719
- Tom!
- Are you sure?

1112
02:22:01,805 --> 02:22:04,797
Moe loves the business.
He never said nothing about selling.

1113
02:22:04,933 --> 02:22:07,800
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.

1114
02:22:08,854 --> 02:22:11,437
See, Johnny...

1115
02:22:11,565 --> 02:22:15,684
We figure that entertainment
would draw gamblers to the casino.

1116
02:22:15,819 --> 02:22:19,608
We hope you'll sign a contract
to appear five times a year.

1117
02:22:22,492 --> 02:22:27,032
Perhaps convince some of your friends
in the movies to do the same.

1118
02:22:28,373 --> 02:22:30,489
We're counting on you.

1119
02:22:32,502 --> 02:22:36,086
Sure, Mike.
I'll do anything for my godfather.

1120
02:22:36,214 --> 02:22:37,579
Good.

1121
02:22:39,092 --> 02:22:43,882
Hey, Mike! Hello, fellows.
Everybody's here. Freddy, Tom.

1122
02:22:44,014 --> 02:22:46,472
Good to see you.
- How are you, Moe?

1123
02:22:46,600 --> 02:22:51,686
Have everything? Specially prepared
food, the best dancers, and good credit.

1124
02:22:51,813 --> 02:22:55,272
Draw chips for everybody,
so they can play on the house.

1125
02:22:57,861 --> 02:23:00,728
Is my credit good enough
to buy you out?

1126
02:23:02,491 --> 02:23:04,277
Buy me out?

1127
02:23:04,409 --> 02:23:06,867
The casino, the hotel.

1128
02:23:06,995 --> 02:23:09,862
The Corleone family
wants to buy you out.

1129
02:23:09,998 --> 02:23:15,493
The Corleone family wants
to buy me out? No, I buy you out.

1130
02:23:15,629 --> 02:23:18,872
Your casino loses money.
We can do better.

1131
02:23:19,007 --> 02:23:23,092
- You think I'm skimming off the top?
- You're unlucky.

1132
02:23:27,766 --> 02:23:30,133
You Guineas make me laugh.

1133
02:23:30,268 --> 02:23:34,978
I took Freddy in when you had a bad
time, and now you try to push me out!

1134
02:23:36,149 --> 02:23:39,767
You did that
because we bankrolled your casino

1135
02:23:39,903 --> 02:23:44,943
and the Molinari family guaranteed
his safety. Let's talk business.

1136
02:23:45,075 --> 02:23:47,988
Yes. First of all, you're all done.

1137
02:23:48,120 --> 02:23:50,452
You don't have
that kind of muscle anymore.

1138
02:23:50,539 --> 02:23:54,874
The Godfather is sick. You're getting
chased out of New York by the others.

1139
02:23:54,960 --> 02:23:58,999
Do you think you can come to my hotel
and take over?

1140
02:23:59,131 --> 02:24:03,921
I talked to Barzini. I can make a deal
with him and still keep my hotel!

1141
02:24:04,052 --> 02:24:07,670
Is that why you slapped my brother
around in public?

1142
02:24:07,764 --> 02:24:12,554
That was nothing, Mike.
Moe didn't mean nothing by that.

1143
02:24:12,686 --> 02:24:16,930
He flies off the handle sometimes,
but we're good friends.

1144
02:24:17,023 --> 02:24:21,733
I have a business to run.
We got to kick asses sometimes.

1145
02:24:21,820 --> 02:24:25,688
We had an argument,
so I had to straighten him out.

1146
02:24:25,782 --> 02:24:28,570
You straightened my brother out?

1147
02:24:28,702 --> 02:24:32,991
He was banging cocktail waitresses!
Players couldn't get a drink.

1148
02:24:33,123 --> 02:24:34,989
What's wrong with you?

1149
02:24:40,172 --> 02:24:42,880
I leave for New York tomorrow.
Think about a price.

1150
02:24:44,176 --> 02:24:45,758
Son-of-a-bitch!

1151
02:24:45,844 --> 02:24:51,055
I'm Moe Greene! I made my bones
when you were out with cheerleaders.

1152
02:24:51,183 --> 02:24:53,550
Wait a minute, Moe. I have an idea.

1153
02:24:54,644 --> 02:24:58,182
Tom, you're the <i>consigliere.</i>
Talk to the Don...

1154
02:24:58,315 --> 02:25:03,776
Just a minute. Don is semi-retired and
Mike is in charge of the family business.

1155
02:25:03,862 --> 02:25:07,025
If you have anything to say,
say it to Michael.

1156
02:25:12,204 --> 02:25:16,949
Mike, you don't come to Las Vegas and
talk to a man like Moe Greene like that!

1157
02:25:17,626 --> 02:25:18,866
Fredo...

1158
02:25:20,170 --> 02:25:22,832
You're my older brother, and I love you.

1159
02:25:24,174 --> 02:25:28,168
But don't ever take sides with anyone
against the family again.

1160
02:25:29,804 --> 02:25:31,044
Ever.

1161
02:25:39,022 --> 02:25:43,186
I have to see my father and his people,
so have dinner without me.

1162
02:25:44,903 --> 02:25:49,693
This weekend we'll go out. We'll go to
the city, see a show and have dinner.

1163
02:25:57,249 --> 02:26:00,037
Your sister wants to ask you something.

1164
02:26:00,168 --> 02:26:02,284
- Let her ask.
- She's afraid to.

1165
02:26:02,420 --> 02:26:05,378
They want you to be godfather
to their boy.

1166
02:26:05,465 --> 02:26:07,251
- We'll see.
- Will you?

1167
02:26:07,384 --> 02:26:09,716
Let me think about it. Come on.

1168
02:26:18,520 --> 02:26:21,433
Barzini will move against you first.

1169
02:26:21,523 --> 02:26:26,063
He'll set up a meeting with someone
you absolutely trust.

1170
02:26:26,152 --> 02:26:28,234
Guaranteeing your safety.

1171
02:26:29,281 --> 02:26:32,319
And at that meeting
you'll be assassinated.

1172
02:26:37,080 --> 02:26:40,072
I like to drink wine more than I used to.

1173
02:26:41,543 --> 02:26:45,207
- Anyway, I'm drinking more.
- It's good for you, Pop.

1174
02:26:50,302 --> 02:26:51,667
I don't know.

1175
02:26:53,722 --> 02:26:56,589
Are you happy with your wife
and children?

1176
02:26:57,600 --> 02:27:00,388
- Very happy.
- That's good.

1177
02:27:02,147 --> 02:27:07,108
I hope you don't mind the way I keep
going over this Barzini business.

1178
02:27:07,193 --> 02:27:10,106
- No, not at all.
- It's an old habit.

1179
02:27:11,698 --> 02:27:14,656
I spend my life trying not to be careless.

1180
02:27:16,119 --> 02:27:19,703
Women and children can be careless,
but not men.

1181
02:27:23,084 --> 02:27:25,291
- How's your boy?
- He's good.

1182
02:27:25,420 --> 02:27:28,287
He looks more like you every day.

1183
02:27:30,967 --> 02:27:35,256
He's smarter I am. He's three
and can read the funny papers.

1184
02:27:37,390 --> 02:27:39,472
Read the funny papers.

1185
02:27:46,775 --> 02:27:52,361
I want you to arrange for a telephone
man to check all in- and out-going calls.

1186
02:27:52,489 --> 02:27:55,777
I did it already.
I took care of that, Pop.

1187
02:27:55,867 --> 02:27:57,858
That's right. I forgot.

1188
02:28:01,873 --> 02:28:03,534
What's the matter?

1189
02:28:04,292 --> 02:28:06,374
What's bothering you?

1190
02:28:10,090 --> 02:28:14,675
I'll handle it. I told you
I can handle it, so I'll handle it.

1191
02:28:27,982 --> 02:28:32,351
I knew that Santino
would have to go through all this.

1192
02:28:32,487 --> 02:28:34,228
And Fredo...

1193
02:28:36,908 --> 02:28:38,899
Fredo was, well...

1194
02:28:40,787 --> 02:28:43,575
But I never wanted this for you.

1195
02:28:45,959 --> 02:28:51,045
I worked my whole life. I don't apologize
for taking care of my family.

1196
02:28:51,172 --> 02:28:55,040
And I refused to be a fool,

1197
02:28:55,176 --> 02:28:59,340
dancing on a string
held by all those big shots.

1198
02:29:01,266 --> 02:29:04,554
I don't apologize. That's my life,
but I thought that,

1199
02:29:06,396 --> 02:29:11,391
that when it was your time, you would
be the one to hold the strings.

1200
02:29:13,361 --> 02:29:18,982
Senator Corleone. Governor Corleone.
Something.

1201
02:29:19,075 --> 02:29:22,067
Another <i>pezzonovante.</i>

1202
02:29:22,203 --> 02:29:23,739
Well...

1203
02:29:27,041 --> 02:29:31,000
Just wasn't enough time, Michael.
Wasn't enough time.

1204
02:29:31,087 --> 02:29:34,455
We'll get there, Pop. We'll get there.

1205
02:29:39,512 --> 02:29:43,847
Now listen, whoever comes to you
with this Barzini meeting,

1206
02:29:43,933 --> 02:29:46,846
he's the traitor. Don't forget that.

1207
02:30:03,828 --> 02:30:05,944
Can I hold it, please?

1208
02:30:21,095 --> 02:30:24,963
- Can I water these?
- Yes, go ahead.

1209
02:30:25,099 --> 02:30:27,761
Over here, over here.

1210
02:30:29,646 --> 02:30:32,263
Be careful. You're spilling it.

1211
02:30:38,488 --> 02:30:40,399
Anthony!

1212
02:30:40,532 --> 02:30:42,148
Come here, come here.

1213
02:30:47,330 --> 02:30:49,913
That's it. We'll put it right there.

1214
02:30:55,213 --> 02:30:57,671
I'll show you something. Come here.

1215
02:30:59,759 --> 02:31:01,591
Stand there.

1216
02:31:05,515 --> 02:31:07,222
Give me an orange!

1217
02:31:25,410 --> 02:31:27,367
That's a new trick.

1218
02:31:28,413 --> 02:31:30,575
You run in there. Run in there.

1219
02:31:44,262 --> 02:31:46,173
Where are you?

1220
02:34:43,733 --> 02:34:46,191
Mike, can I have a minute?

1221
02:34:56,329 --> 02:34:58,616
Baum wants to arrange a meeting.

1222
02:34:58,748 --> 02:35:02,116
He says we can straighten out
any of our problems.

1223
02:35:02,710 --> 02:35:04,951
- You talked to him?
- Yeah.

1224
02:35:06,380 --> 02:35:10,123
I can arrange security. On my territory.

1225
02:35:13,221 --> 02:35:15,838
All right?
- All right.

1226
02:35:33,241 --> 02:35:36,233
Do you know
how they're going to come at you?

1227
02:35:38,871 --> 02:35:42,455
They're arranging a meeting
in Brooklyn. Tessio's ground.

1228
02:35:44,669 --> 02:35:46,376
Where I'll be safe.

1229
02:35:58,683 --> 02:36:02,176
I always thought it would be Clemenza,
not Tessio.

1230
02:36:02,270 --> 02:36:06,059
It's the smart move.
Tessio was always smarter.

1231
02:36:08,317 --> 02:36:09,682
But I'm going to wait.

1232
02:36:10,278 --> 02:36:11,313
After the baptism.

1233
02:36:15,116 --> 02:36:18,905
I've decided to be godfather
to Connie's baby.

1234
02:36:19,036 --> 02:36:22,904
And then I'll meet
with Don Barzini and Tattaglia.

1235
02:36:24,667 --> 02:36:27,625
All the heads of the five families.

1236
02:38:48,561 --> 02:38:51,223
Michael, do you believe in God,
the Father,

1237
02:38:51,355 --> 02:38:53,596
Creator of Heaven and Earth?

1238
02:38:53,691 --> 02:38:54,852
I do.

1239
02:38:54,984 --> 02:38:58,227
<i>Do you believe in Jesus Christ,
His only Son, our Lord?</i>

1240
02:38:58,362 --> 02:38:59,443
<i>I do.</i>

1241
02:38:59,572 --> 02:39:03,657
<i>Do you believe in the
Holy Ghost, the Holy Catholic Church?</i>

1242
02:39:03,784 --> 02:39:05,070
<i>I do.</i>

1243
02:40:10,518 --> 02:40:14,933
Michael Francis Rizzi,
do you renounce Satan?

1244
02:40:21,028 --> 02:40:22,314
I do renounce him.

1245
02:40:32,164 --> 02:40:33,450
And all his works?

1246
02:40:47,304 --> 02:40:48,339
I do renounce them.

1247
02:40:50,057 --> 02:40:51,343
Oh, God!

1248
02:40:54,270 --> 02:40:58,104
- And all his pomps?
- I do renounce them.

1249
02:41:13,789 --> 02:41:18,033
Michael Rizzi, will you be baptized?

1250
02:41:18,169 --> 02:41:19,204
I will.

1251
02:41:26,343 --> 02:41:31,964
Michael Rizzi, go in peace,
and may the Lord be with you. Amen.

1252
02:41:46,238 --> 02:41:48,070
Kay!

1253
02:41:48,199 --> 02:41:50,156
Kiss your godfather.

1254
02:42:14,433 --> 02:42:18,552
Can't go to Vegas.
Something's come up.

1255
02:42:18,646 --> 02:42:20,228
Everybody has to leave without us.

1256
02:42:20,356 --> 02:42:23,348
- Mike, it's our first vacation!
- Connie, please.

1257
02:42:23,442 --> 02:42:27,060
Go back to the house, wait for my call.
It's important.

1258
02:42:28,197 --> 02:42:30,404
I'll only be a couple of days.

1259
02:42:46,799 --> 02:42:49,040
We're on our way to Brooklyn.

1260
02:42:51,262 --> 02:42:54,971
- I hope Mike can get us a good deal.
- I'm sure he will.

1261
02:43:02,690 --> 02:43:08,151
Sal, Tom, the boss says he'll come in a
separate car, so you two go on ahead.

1262
02:43:08,237 --> 02:43:11,775
- That screws up my arrangements.
- That's what he said.

1263
02:43:11,865 --> 02:43:14,072
I can't go either, Sal.

1264
02:43:26,046 --> 02:43:29,880
Tell Mike it was only business.
I always liked him.

1265
02:43:31,510 --> 02:43:34,252
- He understands that.
Excuse me, Sal.

1266
02:43:40,269 --> 02:43:42,886
Tom, can you get me off the hook?

1267
02:43:44,106 --> 02:43:47,315
- For old times' sake?
- Can't do it, Sally.

1268
02:44:32,613 --> 02:44:35,321
You have to answer for Santino, Carlo.

1269
02:44:40,245 --> 02:44:44,330
- Mike, you got it all wrong.
- You fingered Sonny for Barzini.

1270
02:44:45,209 --> 02:44:49,294
That little farce
you played with my sister.

1271
02:44:49,380 --> 02:44:54,250
- You think that could fool a Corleone?
- I'm innocent. I swear on the kids.

1272
02:44:54,343 --> 02:44:57,256
- Please, don't do this.
- Sit down.

1273
02:44:59,848 --> 02:45:02,180
Don't do this to me, please.

1274
02:45:11,276 --> 02:45:13,142
Barzini is dead.

1275
02:45:15,322 --> 02:45:17,484
So is Philip Tattaglia.

1276
02:45:18,784 --> 02:45:20,366
Moe Greene.

1277
02:45:21,328 --> 02:45:25,071
Strachi. Cuneo.

1278
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:32,120
Today I settle all family business,
so don't tell me you're innocent, Carlo.

1279
02:45:32,256 --> 02:45:34,167
Admit what you did.

1280
02:45:38,137 --> 02:45:39,719
Get him a drink.

1281
02:45:46,103 --> 02:45:47,434
Come on.

1282
02:45:48,564 --> 02:45:51,147
Don't be afraid, Carlo.

1283
02:45:51,233 --> 02:45:54,100
Do you think
I'd make my sister a widow?

1284
02:45:55,195 --> 02:45:57,903
I'm godfather to your son, Carlo.

1285
02:46:04,746 --> 02:46:06,783
Go ahead, drink, drink.

1286
02:46:11,545 --> 02:46:15,334
No, you're out of the family business.
That's your punishment.

1287
02:46:16,425 --> 02:46:20,384
You're finished.
I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas.

1288
02:46:20,512 --> 02:46:22,253
Tom.

1289
02:46:26,435 --> 02:46:30,019
I want you to stay there. Understand?

1290
02:46:30,147 --> 02:46:32,559
Only don't tell me you're innocent.

1291
02:46:33,817 --> 02:46:38,186
Because it insults my intelligence.
Makes me very angry.

1292
02:46:42,451 --> 02:46:44,317
Who approached you?

1293
02:46:45,621 --> 02:46:47,953
Tattaglia or Barzini?

1294
02:46:55,797 --> 02:46:57,413
It was Barzini.

1295
02:47:01,595 --> 02:47:03,302
Good.

1296
02:47:09,353 --> 02:47:13,438
There's a car waiting outside
to take you to the airport.

1297
02:47:13,565 --> 02:47:17,183
I'll call your wife
and tell her what flight you're on.

1298
02:47:21,490 --> 02:47:23,982
- Mike...
- Get out of my sight.

1299
02:47:50,102 --> 02:47:51,684
Hello, Carlo.

1300
02:48:51,538 --> 02:48:54,656
- I'm trying to tell you...
- Mama, please!

1301
02:49:03,175 --> 02:49:05,212
Michael!

1302
02:49:05,344 --> 02:49:07,381
- What is it?
- Where is he?

1303
02:49:09,640 --> 02:49:14,806
Michael, you lousy bastard!
You killed my husband.

1304
02:49:14,936 --> 02:49:19,021
You waited until Papa died,
so nobody could stop you.

1305
02:49:19,107 --> 02:49:22,190
You blamed him for Sonny.
Everybody did.

1306
02:49:22,319 --> 02:49:28,031
But you never thought about me!
Now what are we going to do?

1307
02:49:28,158 --> 02:49:29,694
Connie.

1308
02:49:31,995 --> 02:49:34,612
Why do you think
he kept Carlo at the Mall?

1309
02:49:34,748 --> 02:49:37,581
He knew he was going to kill him.

1310
02:49:37,668 --> 02:49:43,084
And you stood godfather to our baby.
You lousy cold-hearted bastard!

1311
02:49:43,215 --> 02:49:47,300
Want to know how many men he had
killed with Carlo? Read the papers!

1312
02:49:47,386 --> 02:49:50,094
That's your husband,
that's your husband!

1313
02:49:59,690 --> 02:50:03,934
No! No, no...

1314
02:50:04,027 --> 02:50:07,486
Take her upstairs. Get her a doctor.

1315
02:50:28,635 --> 02:50:30,342
She's hysterical.

1316
02:50:34,766 --> 02:50:36,677
Hysterical.

1317
02:50:38,687 --> 02:50:40,348
Michael, is it true?

1318
02:50:42,315 --> 02:50:45,899
- Don't ask me about my business, Kay.
- Is it true?

1319
02:50:46,027 --> 02:50:48,689
Don't ask me about my business.
Enough!

1320
02:51:08,800 --> 02:51:10,416
All right.

1321
02:51:13,221 --> 02:51:14,882
This one time.

1322
02:51:18,894 --> 02:51:22,262
This one time
I'll let you ask me about my affairs.

1323
02:51:28,361 --> 02:51:29,647
Is it true?

1324
02:51:33,742 --> 02:51:35,403
Is it?

1325
02:51:37,120 --> 02:51:38,576
No.

1326
02:51:52,511 --> 02:51:55,378
I guess we both need a drink. Come on.

1327
02:52:26,753 --> 02:52:28,369
Don Corleone.
