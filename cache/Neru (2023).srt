00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:57,166
<b>Thumba Police Station.</b>

2
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,208
<b>Yes, Circle Inspector speaking.</b>

3
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:01,125
<b>Where?</b>

4
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,333
<b>Sir, I made the call to the station.</b>

5
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,291
<b>Sir, this is the girl's father.</b>

6
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,041
<b>- Please wait outside.
- Okay, sir.</b>

7
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:27,541
<b>Where is the girl?</b>

8
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,666
<b>- Record her statement.
- Okay, sir.</b>

9
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:45,250
<b>- Are you Seema?
- Yes.</b>

10
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:46,625
<b>You were not here?</b>

11
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,541
<b>After Sir and his wife
left for the wedding,</b>

12
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:49,916
<b>I had gone to the bank.</b>

13
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:51,416
<b>What do you do?</b>

14
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:52,958
<b>I have a business, sir.</b>

15
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,041
<b>I run a Curio shop at Kovalam.</b>

16
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:00,416
<b>Shanthi, what did the police say?
Have they found out who it is?</b>

17
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:03,125
<b>How can a blind girl
identify the person?</b>

18
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,416
<b>There has been contact.</b>

19
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:21,458
<b>Vaginal wall contusion is there.</b>

20
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,708
<b>We've collected the swab.</b>

21
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:24,250
<b>Report?</b>

22
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,916
<b>It will be ready by tomorrow.
I'll give it tomorrow.</b>

23
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:26,541
<b>Okay.</b>

24
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,083
<b>The mother and daughter can sit here.</b>

25
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:29,291
<b>You please wait outside.</b>

26
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,291
<b>After Dad and Mom went out,</b>

27
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,208
<b>Seema Chechi went to the bank.</b>

28
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,625
<b>I went to take a bath then.</b>

29
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,125
<b>When I got out after the bath,</b>

30
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,583
<b>I felt the presence
of someone else in the room.</b>

31
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,291
<b>No, Mom!</b>

32
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:53,583
<b>I'll sleep alone.</b>

33
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,625
<b>- But, dear...
- Mom, please.</b>

34
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:57,041
<b>I want to be alone.</b>

35
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:58,458
<b>Don't force her.</b>

36
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:06,125
<b>Don't lock the door, dear.</b>

37
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,083
<b>What did the police say?</b>

38
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:13,708
<b>They need to find who it is.</b>

39
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,291
<b>That's the first major obstacle.</b>

40
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,375
<b>It's not like other
ordinary cases, right?</b>

41
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,583
<b>Since she is blind....</b>

42
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:40,000
<b>This is it, sir.</b>

43
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,791
<b>Did your daughter make this?</b>

44
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:09,916
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

45
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:11,375
<b>She does sculptures.</b>

46
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,625
<b>She had learned it
before she lost her eye-sight.</b>

47
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,625
<b>But how can she do this
without seeing the person?</b>

48
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:17,750
<b>While he was assaulting me,</b>

49
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,375
<b>I discerned his face
through my fingers.</b>

50
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:25,750
<b>We suspect someone, sir.</b>

51
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:27,875
<b>The day before the incident,</b>

52
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:30,791
<b>a boy who resembles this sculpture
had come here asking for directions.</b>

53
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,333
<b>He had come to our neighbour
Vinod's house.</b>

54
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,125
<b>What's the name of your friend?</b>

55
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,875
<b>His name is Michael, sir.</b>

56
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:39,291
<b>He is my class-mate.</b>

57
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,458
<b>Why did he come here?</b>

58
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:41,916
<b>To invite me for his wedding.</b>

59
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:44,541
<b>Do you know where he would be,
at present?</b>

60
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,041
<b>Hello!
Michael, right?</b>

61
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,083
<b>Yes.</b>

62
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:06,916
<b>- Come.
- What is it, sir?</b>

63
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,250
<b>- Come.
- Come on.</b>

64
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:10,083
<b>- Come, we'll tell you.
- What's the matter?</b>

65
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:33,416
<b>Dear!</b>

66
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,208
<b>- Take her away!
- Dear!</b>

67
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,958
<b>At today's identification parade
in Thumba, Thiruvananthapuram,</b>

68
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,125
<b>for the assault case of the blind girl,</b>

69
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:03,000
<b>she successfully identified the culprit.</b>

70
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:05,833
<b>The girl, who's the
victim in the rape case,</b>

71
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:08,625
<b>identified the culprit
through sound and touch.</b>

72
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:12,083
<b>The accused Michael Joseph,
who has been arrested,</b>

73
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:16,666
<b>is the son of Mumbai based Malayali
businessman Christopher Joseph.</b>

74
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,583
<b>He's engaged
to the Central Minister's daughter...</b>

75
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:22,416
<b>This is the punishment that the Lord
has given him, for deserting us.</b>

76
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:24,375
<b>First, the girl lost her eye-sight.</b>

77
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:25,416
<b>And now, this.</b>

78
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:27,625
<b>This won't be the end of it.</b>

79
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,625
<b>He will continue to suffer!</b>

80
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,291
<b>In the name of settlements
and compensations,</b>

81
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,041
<b>I have invested a lot on you.</b>

82
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:05,958
<b>And I am still investing!</b>

83
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,916
<b>Why are you humiliating us like this?</b>

84
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:11,875
<b>Your wedding has been fixed, right?</b>

85
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,666
<b>What do we tell them now?</b>

86
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:16,458
<b>Christy, what will we do now?</b>

87
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,291
<b>Let him stay behind
bars for some time.</b>

88
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,541
<b>Let's see whether he mends his ways
at least then.</b>

89
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,125
<b>What's the point in crying?</b>

90
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:29,958
<b>Didn't you see how
he's behaving?</b>

91
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,166
<b>You must save him somehow.</b>

92
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,291
<b>Shall we try talking to that girl's family?</b>

93
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,750
<b>- Or, shall we go to their place?
- Ancy, this is not Mumbai.</b>

94
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:39,875
<b>This is Kerala!</b>

95
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,583
<b>I don't want to know all that, Christy.</b>

96
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,291
<b>You must save him,
come what may!</b>

97
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,000
<b>I need Advocate Rajashekhar!</b>

98
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,458
<b>He's mostly in Delhi now, sir.</b>

99
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,541
<b>- I don't care! I want him here!
- Sir!</b>

100
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:23,041
<b>- Hi, CJ!
- It's been a long time!</b>

101
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,083
<b>Yeah!</b>

102
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,833
<b>Meet my daughter, Poornima.</b>

103
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,375
<b>- Hello! Lovely meeting you.
- Nice meeting you.</b>

104
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:28,666
<b>- Is she a lawyer?
- Yeah.</b>

105
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:31,041
<b>She's an independent lawyer....
at the Supreme Court.</b>

106
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:32,125
<b>Wow! That's nice!</b>

107
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:33,875
<b>There's a matter
at the High Court tomorrow.</b>

108
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,583
<b>- So, we came here together.
- Okay.</b>

109
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,000
<b>How will we handle this case?</b>

110
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:40,916
<b>His marriage has been fixed.</b>

111
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:42,625
<b>If he doesn't get bail...</b>

112
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,541
<b>Usually, bail won't be granted.</b>

113
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,291
<b>But when it comes to clients like you,</b>

114
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,375
<b>I have my own ways, CJ.</b>

115
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:53,458
<b>First, let's try for a settlement.</b>

116
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:56,958
<b>This girl's father has two sons
from his first marriage.</b>

117
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,708
<b>Let's make an attempt through them.</b>

118
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,166
<b>But you just landed!</b>

119
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,291
<b>How could you...?</b>

120
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:03,958
<b>That's how I function!</b>

121
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:05,250
<b>Once I accept a case,</b>

122
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:06,875
<b>I'll do a background study first.</b>

123
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,583
<b>Then, I'll try for a settlement.</b>

124
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:11,125
<b>But that would be more profitable
for both of us.</b>

125
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:12,125
<b>Okay, okay.</b>

126
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:13,583
<b>Sir!</b>

127
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,750
<b>I called you guys
to talk about the settlement.</b>

128
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,625
<b>We can pay a fair amount
to that girl as compensation.</b>

129
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:21,875
<b>You must talk to her father.</b>

130
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,500
<b>We will talk to him, sir.</b>

131
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,750
<b>What would be the amount, sir?</b>

132
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:31,500
<b>- Come.
- Okay, sir.</b>

133
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:35,458
<b>There's no point
in fighting the case, Dad.</b>

134
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,250
<b>You'll only be humiliated further.</b>

135
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:38,666
<b>He will be acquitted easily.</b>

136
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,791
<b>His dad is loaded with money.</b>

137
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,333
<b>Nothing will work against them.</b>

138
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,916
<b>We can demand this
only as long as he is in jail.</b>

139
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,333
<b>If you settle this, accepting
the amount they're offering,</b>

140
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:48,958
<b>you can live comfortably hereafter.</b>

141
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:53,708
<b>I'm happy that you guys took the effort
to come here, my dear sons.</b>

142
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,875
<b>Dad, though we're not related by blood,</b>

143
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,666
<b>Sara is our sister, after all.</b>

144
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:00,208
<b>If she has a problem,
shouldn't we intervene?</b>

145
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,458
<b>If you are saying this honestly,</b>

146
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:05,416
<b>you should be helping us
in fighting against them legally.</b>

147
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,875
<b>We won't be able to fight
them legally, Dad.</b>

148
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,708
<b>They will purchase everything they want.</b>

149
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:13,041
<b>If there's such a possibility
before them,</b>

150
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:15,708
<b>will they be ready for
a settlement with us?</b>

151
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,583
<b>They're not interested
in pursuing the case.</b>

152
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,541
<b>We just have tell them
the amount that we need.</b>

153
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,333
<b>I spoke for so long just to get
this out of your mouths.</b>

154
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:25,708
<b>Don't I know how
the two of you are?</b>

155
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,833
<b>Am I not your father?</b>

156
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:29,041
<b>Get out of here!</b>

157
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,375
<b>Shameless fellows!</b>

158
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,833
<b>Trying to make a settlement?</b>

159
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:34,125
<b>- Sara, we were..
- I have nothing more to say.</b>

160
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:35,416
<b>Even if we lose the case,</b>

161
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:37,500
<b>we're not so desperate
as to live off their money.</b>

162
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,000
<b>No one has to come here
to talk about that!</b>

163
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:40,833
<b>- No wonder this happened to you!
- Get out of here!</b>

164
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:43,541
<b>You will suffer for what you did
to my mother!</b>

165
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:46,416
<b>You will suffer doing endless
rounds of the court, with this blind girl.</b>

166
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:48,000
<b>I don't care!
Get out of here!</b>

167
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
<b>Get out, both of you!</b>

168
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,166
<b>What did the Minister say?</b>

169
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:57,333
<b>He is upset.</b>

170
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:01,125
<b>His daughter hasn't been able to digest
the fact that Michael is innocent.</b>

171
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:04,333
<b>Sir!</b>

172
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,333
<b>I don't think the settlement
would be possible, sir.</b>

173
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:10,291
<b>- Are they on the line?
- Yes, sir.</b>

174
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,291
<b>What's the problem?</b>

175
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,250
<b>Sir, Dad is not agreeing
to the settlement.</b>

176
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:19,541
<b>Are there any media-persons
over there?</b>

177
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:20,666
<b>No, sir.</b>

178
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,500
<b>You must call some people
from the media.</b>

179
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,125
<b>Okay.</b>

180
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:26,625
<b>Okay, sir.</b>

181
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,500
<b>What is it?</b>

182
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:30,958
<b>We have a small task.</b>

183
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,250
<b>Do you know who we are?</b>

184
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:33,666
<b>We are the victim's brothers.</b>

185
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,541
<b>We know why you've gathered here.</b>

186
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:36,750
<b>- Didn't you call us here?
- Who called you?</b>

187
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:37,958
<b>Didn't you call us here?</b>

188
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,791
<b>- Who the hell called you here?
- Mind your language!</b>

189
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:40,666
<b>- Hello, sir!</b>

190
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:43,000
<b>- Mohammed, what have you done?
- Sir, I...</b>

191
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,083
<b>Didn't I tell you that
we should be really careful</b>

192
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,666
<b>until the bail application
is considered?</b>

193
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:50,416
<b>- Let me tell you, sir.
- Annoying the media will act against you.</b>

194
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:51,958
<b>Sir, I'm not aware of all this.</b>

195
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,375
<b>You know who's representing
the culprit, right?</b>

196
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,625
<b>India's leading Defence Lawyer.</b>

197
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,041
<b>Advocate Rajashekhar.</b>

198
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:01,750
<b>Where are you all running off to?</b>

199
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:04,000
<b>- Is it a roll call?
- Rajashekharan sir has a trial today.</b>

200
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,958
<b>- Which Rajashekharan?
- Rajashekharan sir, from Supreme Court.</b>

201
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,583
<b>- The Thumba case.
- Oh! It's today?</b>

202
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:32,000
<b>Crime No. 2752/2022.</b>

203
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:33,208
<b>Thumba Police Station.</b>

204
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,250
<b>Accused, Michael.</b>

205
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:41,416
<b>Mr. Rajashekhar!</b>

206
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,208
<b>Welcome back to Trivandrum District Court.</b>

207
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:45,625
<b>Thank you.
Thank you, Your Honour.</b>

208
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,291
<b>It must be a sensational case.</b>

209
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:48,333
<b>No.</b>

210
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:49,833
<b>It's an ordinary case.</b>

211
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,125
<b>Then you will make it sensational
with your presence.</b>

212
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,791
<b>Yes!</b>

213
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:01,708
<b>Your Honour,</b>

214
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,541
<b>this is a case of house-trespass
and rape...</b>

215
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:06,125
<b>in the broad daylight,</b>

216
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:07,458
<b>on a blind girl.</b>

217
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:10,500
<b>An unknown young man
appears out of thin air,</b>

218
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:13,458
<b>rapes a blind girl
in the middle of the day,</b>

219
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,291
<b>leaves no trace behind,
and vanishes.</b>

220
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,791
<b>That girl, who has never seen
anything with her eyes in her life,</b>

221
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,958
<b>makes a sculpture of that person
using her own hands.</b>

222
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:24,875
<b>The police, upon seeing the face
of the sculpture, charge the accused.</b>

223
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:28,833
<b>- She could see until she was 12..
- What 12? That's not relevant!</b>

224
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:31,625
<b>Your Honour, the crimes
of rape and assault,</b>

225
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,833
<b>outlined in the IPC written in 1860,</b>

226
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,750
<b>aren't exclusive to Uttar Pradesh.</b>

227
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:39,083
<b>There's no shortage of such stories
in our Kerala Police case diaries either.</b>

228
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:40,416
<b>Yes, yes.</b>

229
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:41,416
<b>I've seen the files.</b>

230
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:43,583
<b>I was also curious.</b>

231
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:45,666
<b>How did she identify him?</b>

232
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:49,166
<b>The girl knows how to make sculptures.</b>

233
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:51,458
<b>Using that skill,
she made a statue of the accused.</b>

234
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:52,666
<b>That's how he was arrested.</b>

235
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:56,333
<b>We're lucky that the statue
didn't resemble any of us.</b>

236
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,875
<b>What do you say, PP?</b>

237
00:15:58,916 --> 00:15:59,916
<b>Err... Err...</b>

238
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:02,125
<b>Evidence....</b>

239
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,916
<b>Evidence is still being collected.</b>

240
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,958
<b>But... effective investigation
is going on, Your Honour.</b>

241
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:08,958
<b>Wound certificate?</b>

242
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:10,333
<b>Err...</b>

243
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:14,916
<b>What are you searching for?</b>

244
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:16,541
<b>Yes!</b>

245
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,083
<b>There is a contusion!</b>

246
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:19,458
<b>She's in her teens, right?</b>

247
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,458
<b>She's likely to have contusions
in many places.</b>

248
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:27,708
<b>So, the State has no objection
to granting bail?</b>

249
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,750
<b>No, no, no!</b>

250
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:31,708
<b>It's not like that.
Offence is committed, Your Honour...</b>

251
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,375
<b>By the... On the victim.</b>

252
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:35,500
<b>Effective investigation is also going on.</b>

253
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,041
<b>But the evidence...</b>

254
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,125
<b>- What about the test identification?
- In the test identification,</b>

255
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,000
<b>the girl has identified him
by touch and sound.</b>

256
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:43,041
<b>Yeah, right!</b>

257
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:45,583
<b>How can a girl who doesn't know
how her own face looks like,</b>

258
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:46,958
<b>identify another person's face?</b>

259
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,750
<b>This is just a farce being played
out in front of the Magistrate.</b>

260
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,250
<b>Your Honour,</b>

261
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:53,458
<b>there is no trace of semen,</b>

262
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,583
<b>no injuries found in the wound certificate,</b>

263
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,416
<b>fingerprints are also absent.</b>

264
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,041
<b>The Prosecutor is
struggling to oppose,</b>

265
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:03,625
<b>as there is no material evidence to connect
the accused with this alleged crime.</b>

266
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:06,416
<b>Bail application may kindly
be allowed, Your Honour.</b>

267
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:24,916
<b>Bail granted.</b>

268
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:26,458
<b>Huh?</b>

269
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:33,458
<b>Next!</b>

270
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:37,000
<b>Sir! Sir! Did you expect
that bail would be granted?</b>

271
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:38,375
<b>Well, 100%.</b>

272
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:39,958
<b>Because this is a fake case.</b>

273
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,458
<b>My client has been framed.</b>

274
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:42,541
<b>Thank you.</b>

275
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:51,125
<b>Sir, I didn't expect that bail
will be granted so quickly.</b>

276
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:53,833
<b>What can I do if the court
does not believe this story of yours?</b>

277
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,000
<b>Story?</b>

278
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,958
<b>Convincing you about all this
is not my job!</b>

279
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,666
<b>If you have any doubts,
talk to the investigating officer.</b>

280
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:04,791
<b>He got bail?</b>

281
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:08,250
<b>But everyone told me that bail
won't be granted in such cases usually.</b>

282
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,875
<b>According to them,
the evidence isn't sufficient.</b>

283
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,583
<b>Didn't our daughter identify him?</b>

284
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,291
<b>She sculpted his face, right?</b>

285
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,416
<b>That's not credible enough, apparently.</b>

286
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:29,791
<b>Don't worry, dear.</b>

287
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,458
<b>The case is not over, right?</b>

288
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:34,750
<b>We will continue to fight!</b>

289
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:42,166
<b>Michael,</b>

290
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:45,666
<b>tell me whatever happened,
as they happened.</b>

291
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,916
<b>I don't want you to miss anything.</b>

292
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:57,041
<b>My God!</b>

293
00:18:57,916 --> 00:18:59,041
<b>He's a born criminal!</b>

294
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:02,250
<b>He has created enough loopholes
to evade punishment himself.</b>

295
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:06,125
<b>To be honest, such guys
should be killed on the spot.</b>

296
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,166
<b>Dear...</b>

297
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,000
<b>We are lawyers!
Don't forget that.</b>

298
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:11,875
<b>We are human beings too, Dad!</b>

299
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,916
<b>If we don't accept this case,
someone else will.</b>

300
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:17,458
<b>Or the Government will hire
a lawyer for him, funded by them.</b>

301
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,500
<b>How does it matter then?</b>

302
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,000
<b>By the way, what's
happening with your case?</b>

303
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,208
<b>I've got the order.</b>

304
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,416
<b>- I will leave tomorrow.
- Oh!</b>

305
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:24,500
<b>When are you coming?</b>

306
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,666
<b>I have two more important meetings.</b>

307
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,041
<b>Sometimes, tomorrow evening.
Otherwise, day after.</b>

308
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:30,708
<b>Okay.</b>

309
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,125
<b>Why did you want to
meet me urgently, sir?</b>

310
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,375
<b>Most likely, I'll be transferred from here.</b>

311
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:40,416
<b>There was immense pressure upon me
to make some adjustments.</b>

312
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:41,541
<b>But I didn't give in.</b>

313
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,000
<b>The Public Prosecutor
is not dependable.</b>

314
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:48,666
<b>So, you must give an application
requesting for a Special Public Prosecutor.</b>

315
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,958
<b>I have some connections
in the Home Ministry.</b>

316
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,958
<b>Moreover, the Government
usually considers the name</b>

317
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,666
<b>that the investigating officer suggests.</b>

318
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,625
<b>I will do as you say, sir.</b>

319
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:58,916
<b>And one more thing.</b>

320
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,916
<b>Many will approach you,
to take up your case.</b>

321
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:04,416
<b>They will say that they can assist
the current Prosecutor and all that.</b>

322
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:07,166
<b>But do not take any decision,
without consulting me.</b>

323
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:08,958
<b>Okay, sir.</b>

324
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,125
<b>- Print this.
- Okay, sir.</b>

325
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:19,750
<b>Mr. Mohammed...</b>

326
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:21,166
<b>I am a Defence Lawyer.</b>

327
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:23,625
<b>It's not because I have a problem
in appearing for the victim.</b>

328
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,250
<b>I'm really busy.</b>

329
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:27,375
<b>The trial of a murder
case is going on now.</b>

330
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:30,416
<b>However much your fee is,
I can pay it together as a lump-sum.</b>

331
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,541
<b>It's not about the fee, Mr. Mohammed.</b>

332
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:33,916
<b>I told you, right?</b>

333
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:34,958
<b>I am really busy.</b>

334
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,208
<b>It would be better if you
approach someone else.</b>

335
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:38,375
<b>Okay then.</b>

336
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:41,500
<b>- Give these at the court tomorrow.
- Okay, sir.</b>

337
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:49,166
<b>Brother!</b>

338
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:58,916
<b>There's no point in meeting
any of the senior advocates here.</b>

339
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,916
<b>This is entirely
Advocate Rajashekharan's game.</b>

340
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,875
<b>Advocate Rajashekharan was
at the Tennis Club yesterday.</b>

341
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,666
<b>He must have influenced
all the senior advocates.</b>

342
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,250
<b>They are rich people.</b>

343
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:13,625
<b>They can do anything they want!</b>

344
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:16,041
<b>We haven't hurt anyone till date.</b>

345
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:18,833
<b>Yet...</b>

346
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:20,541
<b>why do we have to suffer...</b>

347
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,083
<b>I am Advocate Sudheer Kottayil.</b>

348
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,375
<b>She just has to sign
this document.</b>

349
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:41,208
<b>I will take care of everything else.</b>

350
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,250
<b>Even if Sir says that
he has accepted this case,</b>

351
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,958
<b>consider that you've
won half the battle.</b>

352
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,625
<b>Didn't I tell you, sir?</b>

353
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:48,666
<b>Give me a day's time.</b>

354
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:50,541
<b>I will come to your office.</b>

355
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:51,708
<b>Mr. Mohammed,</b>

356
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:54,000
<b>you know who
the defence lawyer is, right?</b>

357
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:55,750
<b>Major games are at play now.</b>

358
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,541
<b>With every moment
that you're wasting now,</b>

359
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,250
<b>your case is becoming weaker.</b>

360
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:02,750
<b>If the fee is the problem,
we can give you a discount.</b>

361
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:05,291
<b>Sudheer sir considers this case
as a prestige issue.</b>

362
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,958
<b>- Yes.
- Didn't I tell you, sir?</b>

363
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:09,166
<b>I will come to your office.</b>

364
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:15,250
<b>I wonder why he was so late
in approaching you.</b>

365
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:17,500
<b>Many more such frauds
will approach you.</b>

366
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:19,208
<b>None of them are trustworthy.</b>

367
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,125
<b>Don't worry, Mohammed.</b>

368
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:22,833
<b>We'll find someone else.</b>

369
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:29,125
<b>I'm not asking you to refrain from
testifying or to change sides, Chechi.</b>

370
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:31,166
<b>In your testimony,</b>

371
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:33,791
<b>just add certain words
that we're suggesting.</b>

372
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:35,375
<b>No one will understand anything.</b>

373
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:37,958
<b>And you will get some money too.</b>

374
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:42,041
<b>How much will I get?</b>

375
00:22:43,916 --> 00:22:44,916
<b>Advocate!</b>

376
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:46,166
<b>It's a success!</b>

377
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:48,166
<b>You know my account number, right?</b>

378
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:50,666
<b>The money should be credited
in my account tomorrow morning.</b>

379
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,250
<b>What? What?</b>

380
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:53,291
<b>Easy?</b>

381
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:54,916
<b>Then why didn't you do it yourself?</b>

382
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,208
<b>I had to brainwash her
for five to six hours.</b>

383
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:00,958
<b>If the money is not credited in
my account by tomorrow morning,</b>

384
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,375
<b>the testimony will change.</b>

385
00:23:03,541 --> 00:23:04,833
<b>Okay.
Okay then.</b>

386
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:14,250
<b>Stop, stop!</b>

387
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:20,291
<b>Hey!</b>

388
00:23:23,041 --> 00:23:24,541
<b>Long time, sir!</b>

389
00:23:24,541 --> 00:23:26,791
<b>- What are you doing here?
- I came to meet someone.</b>

390
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:29,375
<b>There's a friend of yours, right?</b>

391
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,083
<b>- Advocate Vijayamohan?
- Yes.</b>

392
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:32,291
<b>Where is he now?</b>

393
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:33,333
<b>What's the matter?</b>

394
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:36,125
<b>I need to talk to him
about a case.</b>

395
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:43,958
<b>Sir!</b>

396
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:46,875
<b>Sir!</b>

397
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:48,958
<b>Sir!</b>

398
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:55,000
<b>- Please wait here, sir.
- Okay.</b>

399
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:02,416
<b>Sir!</b>

400
00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:04,833
<b>Sir!</b>

401
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:08,166
<b>Sir!</b>

402
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:11,875
<b>Sir!</b>

403
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:13,541
<b>Sir!</b>

404
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:15,125
<b>Huh?</b>

405
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:16,458
<b>Ahaana!</b>

406
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:17,833
<b>Who?</b>

407
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:18,958
<b>It's Ahaana, sir.</b>

408
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,291
<b>Ah!</b>

409
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:25,000
<b>- What is it?
- Someone is here to meet you.</b>

410
00:24:25,916 --> 00:24:26,958
<b>Huh?</b>

411
00:24:32,708 --> 00:24:33,708
<b>This...</b>

412
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:39,666
<b>Sir, that witness has escaped.</b>

413
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,541
<b>He can't say that, it seems.</b>

414
00:24:42,833 --> 00:24:44,625
<b>- Rather than catching him...
- Hey!</b>

415
00:24:44,666 --> 00:24:45,666
<b>Just a minute.</b>

416
00:24:46,083 --> 00:24:48,125
<b>- Namaste.
- Sir, this is CI Paul Varghese.</b>

417
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,666
<b>- Hello.
- I'll call you back.</b>

418
00:24:50,708 --> 00:24:51,708
<b>Hang up.</b>

419
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:56,833
<b>Sir, did you notice...</b>

420
00:24:57,083 --> 00:24:58,916
<b>a new case on the media recently?</b>

421
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:02,750
<b>The case of a blind girl who was raped?</b>

422
00:25:02,791 --> 00:25:04,208
<b>That famous group from Bombay?</b>

423
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,250
<b>Yes, CJ Group.</b>

424
00:25:05,291 --> 00:25:06,291
<b>It's his son.</b>

425
00:25:06,833 --> 00:25:09,208
<b>The Public Prosecutor
messed up in the case.</b>

426
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:10,375
<b>The accused got bail.</b>

427
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,000
<b>In this case,</b>

428
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,791
<b>as the Special Public Prosecutor...</b>

429
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:18,500
<b>We're planning to suggest your name, sir.</b>

430
00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:20,458
<b>Me?</b>

431
00:25:21,958 --> 00:25:23,291
<b>What are you saying?</b>

432
00:25:26,416 --> 00:25:28,250
<b>Sir, it's been many years
since I stepped into the court.</b>

433
00:25:28,291 --> 00:25:29,625
<b>You still have that fire!</b>

434
00:25:30,625 --> 00:25:32,208
<b>We have confidence in you, sir.</b>

435
00:25:32,458 --> 00:25:34,750
<b>There are so many
experienced advocates out there.</b>

436
00:25:35,583 --> 00:25:36,958
<b>Give this case to them.</b>

437
00:25:37,541 --> 00:25:39,625
<b>Sir, since Rajashekhar
is the defence lawyer,</b>

438
00:25:39,666 --> 00:25:42,000
<b>most of the advocates are
not ready to accept this case.</b>

439
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:43,833
<b>Even if such a
person comes forward,</b>

440
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,583
<b>they won't be sincere about it.</b>

441
00:25:46,041 --> 00:25:48,333
<b>To handle a trial...</b>

442
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,833
<b>Sir, I am not fit for this case.</b>

443
00:25:54,125 --> 00:25:55,708
<b>Sir, long back...</b>

444
00:25:55,791 --> 00:25:57,583
<b>Rajashekhar had us in deep water, right?</b>

445
00:25:58,375 --> 00:26:00,291
<b>Don't you want to get
back at him somehow?</b>

446
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:02,250
<b>There's no revenge
in my heart towards anyone.</b>

447
00:26:03,625 --> 00:26:04,875
<b>I had forgotten it long back.</b>

448
00:26:05,041 --> 00:26:06,833
<b>Sir, it's not about revenge
for me either.</b>

449
00:26:07,625 --> 00:26:10,125
<b>I clearly know
what your passion is, sir.</b>

450
00:26:10,958 --> 00:26:15,083
<b>It's out of my desire to see you
practising as a good lawyer, like earlier.</b>

451
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:18,041
<b>That won't be possible now.</b>

452
00:26:27,875 --> 00:26:30,458
<b>Sir, can you come to a place with me?</b>

453
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:33,291
<b>Please!</b>

454
00:26:44,291 --> 00:26:45,583
<b>Dear, it's us!</b>

455
00:26:48,125 --> 00:26:50,500
<b>Dear, someone is here to meet you.</b>

456
00:26:50,916 --> 00:26:53,208
<b>He's the Advocate who's going
to fight the case for us.</b>

457
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,500
<b>- Hey, I--
- Please don't say anything now, sir.</b>

458
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,583
<b>Please come, sir.</b>

459
00:27:00,625 --> 00:27:02,000
<b>Come.
Please!</b>

460
00:27:02,375 --> 00:27:03,416
<b>Go inside, sir.</b>

461
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:07,416
<b>Dear, this is Advocate Vijayamohan sir.</b>

462
00:27:09,125 --> 00:27:10,166
<b>Namaste, sir.</b>

463
00:27:11,666 --> 00:27:12,750
<b>Namaste.</b>

464
00:27:16,833 --> 00:27:18,833
<b>Sir, these are all sculptures
made by my daughter.</b>

465
00:27:21,333 --> 00:27:24,166
<b>She lost her eye-sight
when she was 12 years old.</b>

466
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:27,416
<b>She had learned all this from me,
before that.</b>

467
00:27:28,125 --> 00:27:29,833
<b>If you want to know something,</b>

468
00:27:29,833 --> 00:27:30,875
<b>you can talk to her.</b>

469
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:33,083
<b>- But, I...
- Sir, please talk to her now.</b>

470
00:27:33,083 --> 00:27:34,500
<b>We'll decide everything else later.</b>

471
00:27:34,541 --> 00:27:35,791
<b>Come, let's wait outside.</b>

472
00:27:36,041 --> 00:27:37,041
<b>Carry on, sir.</b>

473
00:27:37,166 --> 00:27:38,166
<b>Come.</b>

474
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,750
<b>Sir?</b>

475
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:02,333
<b>Huh?</b>

476
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:05,583
<b>Thank you, sir.</b>

477
00:28:06,416 --> 00:28:08,833
<b>Dad had told me that no one
was willing to take on this case.</b>

478
00:28:09,416 --> 00:28:11,458
<b>At least you felt the
need to take it up, right?</b>

479
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,500
<b>What do you want to know?</b>

480
00:28:12,583 --> 00:28:13,583
<b>Please ask me.</b>

481
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:19,208
<b>- Hey, I...
- My name is Sara.</b>

482
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:22,083
<b>Sara...</b>

483
00:28:22,375 --> 00:28:24,833
<b>Sara, I'm not a practising
Advocate at the moment.</b>

484
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,291
<b>I know.</b>

485
00:28:26,708 --> 00:28:28,750
<b>I had heard CI Sir talking to Dad.</b>

486
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:32,666
<b>Dad says that I can hear everything
even louder, since I am blind.</b>

487
00:28:34,666 --> 00:28:35,666
<b>I know, sir.</b>

488
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,291
<b>We will win this case.</b>

489
00:28:38,333 --> 00:28:39,375
<b>I can sense it.</b>

490
00:28:40,666 --> 00:28:43,458
<b>Things are different from how
you're imagining them, Sara.</b>

491
00:28:46,041 --> 00:28:47,041
<b>So...</b>

492
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:50,416
<b>You haven't come
to take up this case?</b>

493
00:28:52,791 --> 00:28:55,583
<b>I don't know whether you would
understand what I'm saying.</b>

494
00:28:57,125 --> 00:28:59,625
<b>It's been many years
since I attended a trial.</b>

495
00:29:00,708 --> 00:29:02,000
<b>I lost that touch.</b>

496
00:29:03,666 --> 00:29:04,666
<b>I am not...</b>

497
00:29:04,916 --> 00:29:06,416
<b>confident any more.</b>

498
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:10,791
<b>I can understand that...</b>

499
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:12,500
<b>more than anyone else, sir.</b>

500
00:29:14,541 --> 00:29:17,250
<b>But think about my situation, sir.</b>

501
00:29:18,958 --> 00:29:21,250
<b>My father died
when I was really young.</b>

502
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,041
<b>After that,</b>

503
00:29:24,333 --> 00:29:25,833
<b>I lost my eye-sight.</b>

504
00:29:27,958 --> 00:29:28,958
<b>Even in that darkness,</b>

505
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,666
<b>through a God-given skill,</b>

506
00:29:30,666 --> 00:29:31,791
<b>I found a path to light.</b>

507
00:29:36,125 --> 00:29:37,125
<b>And now, this.</b>

508
00:29:40,208 --> 00:29:41,750
<b>All the sounds around me...</b>

509
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:43,208
<b>are really scaring me.</b>

510
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:46,375
<b>But...</b>

511
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,916
<b>I will break free from all this.</b>

512
00:29:50,041 --> 00:29:51,333
<b>My blindness is just physical,</b>

513
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:53,750
<b>not mental.</b>

514
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,458
<b>I refuse to live in fear
of the man who assaulted me.</b>

515
00:30:14,041 --> 00:30:16,375
<b>Shall I tell you what
your situation is right now, sir?</b>

516
00:30:16,458 --> 00:30:18,375
<b>You're unable to take up this case,</b>

517
00:30:19,125 --> 00:30:20,625
<b>and you don't want to hurt me either.</b>

518
00:30:23,958 --> 00:30:25,166
<b>You are an honest man.</b>

519
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,583
<b>Otherwise,</b>

520
00:30:27,833 --> 00:30:29,791
<b>you'd have cooked up a lie
and escaped from here.</b>

521
00:30:32,625 --> 00:30:34,125
<b>Don't be sad about that, sir.</b>

522
00:30:36,875 --> 00:30:38,458
<b>I'm sure someone will come to help me.</b>

523
00:30:39,916 --> 00:30:41,666
<b>That belief keeps me going.</b>

524
00:30:48,625 --> 00:30:51,083
<b>Will there be a delay in getting
the Government order, sir?</b>

525
00:30:51,166 --> 00:30:52,833
<b>We can speed that up.</b>

526
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:54,125
<b>Shall we leave?</b>

527
00:30:54,166 --> 00:30:55,333
<b>- Let's leave.
- Sir...</b>

528
00:30:55,375 --> 00:30:56,875
<b>- The case...
- Let me study the case.</b>

529
00:30:57,791 --> 00:31:00,083
<b>- He didn't say anything.
- He will. We'll sort it out.</b>

530
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,500
<b>Sir, shall I ask you something openly?</b>

531
00:31:05,958 --> 00:31:09,375
<b>What's the actual reason why
you're trying to avoid this case?</b>

532
00:31:11,291 --> 00:31:12,458
<b>Are you afraid of failure?</b>

533
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,958
<b>My own failure doesn't concern me;</b>

534
00:31:19,916 --> 00:31:21,791
<b>but it's crucial that
the girl doesn't fail.</b>

535
00:31:22,625 --> 00:31:23,625
<b>You said it, sir.</b>

536
00:31:24,333 --> 00:31:26,083
<b>This is exactly why
we came to you, sir.</b>

537
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,791
<b>Which other lawyer
would think in this way?</b>

538
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:31,916
<b>Think about it and let us know
about your decision, sir.</b>

539
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:33,916
<b>We are all counting on you.</b>

540
00:31:38,916 --> 00:31:40,916
<b>It's not because I don't trust you, sir.</b>

541
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:43,791
<b>Just consider that I am
sharing my concerns openly.</b>

542
00:31:44,291 --> 00:31:46,125
<b>Will this lawyer be right for us, sir?</b>

543
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,291
<b>He is highly knowledgeable
in the field of law.</b>

544
00:31:48,291 --> 00:31:49,458
<b>He's well updated too.</b>

545
00:31:49,791 --> 00:31:51,541
<b>In several important criminal cases,</b>

546
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:54,083
<b>he's the one who writes
argument notes for lawyers.</b>

547
00:31:54,833 --> 00:31:57,083
<b>Similarly, in many complicated cases,</b>

548
00:31:57,125 --> 00:32:00,500
<b>even senior lawyers call him
to seek advice.</b>

549
00:32:00,916 --> 00:32:02,708
<b>That's his source of income, as well.</b>

550
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
<b>Forgive me, sir.</b>

551
00:32:04,291 --> 00:32:06,083
<b>I don't really know
much about this.</b>

552
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:07,541
<b>Yet, I am asking this.</b>

553
00:32:07,958 --> 00:32:09,958
<b>Giving legal opinions
and handling a trial...</b>

554
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,625
<b>are two entirely
different things, right?</b>

555
00:32:11,666 --> 00:32:13,833
<b>He's a lawyer who used
to handle trials very well.</b>

556
00:32:13,833 --> 00:32:15,208
<b>Why did he stop it then?</b>

557
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,958
<b>It's an incident that
happened many years ago.</b>

558
00:32:21,083 --> 00:32:22,333
<b>Rajashekhar was a senior lawyer</b>

559
00:32:22,375 --> 00:32:24,708
<b>who had an extensive career
specializing in criminal cases.</b>

560
00:32:25,083 --> 00:32:27,250
<b>Vijayamohan, who started
as a junior in his office,</b>

561
00:32:27,291 --> 00:32:29,250
<b>swiftly became established
in the field of trials.</b>

562
00:32:29,333 --> 00:32:32,000
<b>Around that time,
Rajashekhar's daughter, Poornima...</b>

563
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,666
<b>joined the office as a junior lawyer.</b>

564
00:32:34,375 --> 00:32:36,541
<b>As time went by, they grew
quite close to each other.</b>

565
00:32:37,333 --> 00:32:39,166
<b>That could explain why Vijayamohan...</b>

566
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:41,750
<b>chose to stay there
instead of setting up his own office.</b>

567
00:32:42,666 --> 00:32:44,625
<b>Every phase of Vijayamohan's growth,</b>

568
00:32:44,666 --> 00:32:46,625
<b>happened right in front
of Rajashekharan's eyes.</b>

569
00:32:46,958 --> 00:32:51,041
<b>And... the closeness between Vijayamohan
and his daughter didn't please him.</b>

570
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:54,791
<b>That's when I was appointed as
the Sessions Clerk in the court,</b>

571
00:32:54,833 --> 00:32:56,208
<b>having passed the Government test.</b>

572
00:32:56,791 --> 00:32:58,916
<b>Vijayamohan borrowed certain
court documents from me,</b>

573
00:32:58,958 --> 00:33:00,708
<b>explaining that they
were needed for a case,</b>

574
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,625
<b>promising to return
them on the next day.</b>

575
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,708
<b>As per the rules, we're not
supposed to give it to anyone.</b>

576
00:33:05,833 --> 00:33:08,583
<b>But we do help certain lawyers
whom we trust,</b>

577
00:33:08,583 --> 00:33:10,416
<b>when it comes to emergency situations.</b>

578
00:33:10,875 --> 00:33:11,875
<b>Anyway,</b>

579
00:33:11,916 --> 00:33:13,750
<b>those documents went
missing from Vijayamohan.</b>

580
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:15,333
<b>It became a huge issue.</b>

581
00:33:16,458 --> 00:33:17,583
<b>The court intervened...</b>

582
00:33:17,666 --> 00:33:20,250
<b>and suspended Vijayamohan
from the bar council for five years.</b>

583
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:22,083
<b>Along with that, I lost my job too.</b>

584
00:33:22,666 --> 00:33:24,791
<b>But we realized after a while...</b>

585
00:33:24,958 --> 00:33:26,916
<b>that it was Rajashekhar,
who was behind all this.</b>

586
00:33:27,666 --> 00:33:30,958
<b>Soon after, Rajashekhar got his daughter
married to a Supreme Court lawyer.</b>

587
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:32,791
<b>And she shifted base to Delhi.</b>

588
00:33:32,875 --> 00:33:34,166
<b>So, after his suspension period,</b>

589
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,875
<b>he never got back to practising?</b>

590
00:33:36,333 --> 00:33:37,583
<b>He did start practising,</b>

591
00:33:37,833 --> 00:33:39,708
<b>but he wasn't getting
any good cases.</b>

592
00:33:40,208 --> 00:33:42,583
<b>Knowing that he could become
a threat if he advanced further,</b>

593
00:33:42,583 --> 00:33:44,250
<b>everyone joined forces
to suppress him.</b>

594
00:33:44,541 --> 00:33:46,875
<b>When Section 114's presumption....</b>

595
00:33:47,166 --> 00:33:50,458
<b>is limited to the recovery
of stolen properties,</b>

596
00:33:50,791 --> 00:33:52,458
<b>it can be presumed that he stole it,</b>

597
00:33:52,708 --> 00:33:55,166
<b>or received the stolen properties.</b>

598
00:33:56,583 --> 00:33:59,291
<b>But it cannot be presumed
that he committed the murder,</b>

599
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:02,416
<b>unless there are foundational facts.</b>

600
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:04,833
<b>Double presumption is not possible.</b>

601
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:06,750
<b>Sir, anything about the case?</b>

602
00:34:07,416 --> 00:34:09,958
<b>I have many cases.
Which case are you talking about?</b>

603
00:34:10,166 --> 00:34:12,000
<b>Refer Justin v/s State of Kerala.</b>

604
00:34:12,041 --> 00:34:13,833
<b>- The rape of the blind girl.
- Oh! That one?</b>

605
00:34:14,291 --> 00:34:16,166
<b>Haven't you heard of "easy money"?</b>

606
00:34:16,166 --> 00:34:18,625
<b>Money that's made easily,
without putting in any effort?</b>

607
00:34:18,666 --> 00:34:21,166
<b>This case is an attempt
to make money like that.</b>

608
00:34:21,208 --> 00:34:22,500
<b>Who is behind this, sir?</b>

609
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:24,000
<b>It will be revealed gradually.</b>

610
00:34:24,041 --> 00:34:27,250
<b>Anyway, we have strong evidence
to prove that my client is innocent.</b>

611
00:34:27,291 --> 00:34:29,125
<b>- Sir, the Central Minister's daughter--
- Sorry!</b>

612
00:34:29,166 --> 00:34:30,375
<b>No more comments, please.</b>

613
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,375
<b>Talking about direct evidence...</b>

614
00:34:38,625 --> 00:34:41,250
<b>The content of the chemical substance
found from the vaginal wall,</b>

615
00:34:42,041 --> 00:34:45,500
<b>and the chemical substance of the condom
found from the accused's wallet,</b>

616
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:46,958
<b>are one and the same.</b>

617
00:34:47,416 --> 00:34:48,791
<b>There are no fingerprints.</b>

618
00:34:51,541 --> 00:34:53,958
<b>And... the day before the incident,</b>

619
00:34:54,541 --> 00:34:56,375
<b>the accused stayed in
the neighbouring house,</b>

620
00:34:56,416 --> 00:34:57,916
<b>and we have
witnesses to testify that.</b>

621
00:34:58,375 --> 00:35:00,958
<b>Proving the identification in court...</b>

622
00:35:01,208 --> 00:35:02,458
<b>is the challenge in this case.</b>

623
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:28,125
<b>The Government has given
this car for you, sir.</b>

624
00:35:28,666 --> 00:35:30,208
<b>To take it back
after the case, right?</b>

625
00:35:30,875 --> 00:35:32,333
<b>I don't want any new habits.</b>

626
00:35:32,333 --> 00:35:33,333
<b>I'll take an Uber.</b>

627
00:35:34,625 --> 00:35:35,625
<b>- Paul!
- Sir!</b>

628
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:38,458
<b>The photos of the sculpture
and the memory card...</b>

629
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,708
<b>are not present in the CD.</b>

630
00:35:40,708 --> 00:35:43,000
<b>It's present, sir.
It's present in the Mahazar report.</b>

631
00:35:43,041 --> 00:35:44,416
<b>It's present only in the Mahazar.</b>

632
00:35:44,458 --> 00:35:45,791
<b>It's missing in the CD.</b>

633
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,500
<b>Oh!</b>

634
00:35:47,875 --> 00:35:49,541
<b>So, he must have shifted it.</b>

635
00:35:49,625 --> 00:35:51,041
<b>The new investigating officer.</b>

636
00:36:10,958 --> 00:36:11,958
<b>Come, come!</b>

637
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,625
<b>Sir, this is Ashwathy.</b>

638
00:36:20,083 --> 00:36:21,375
<b>She is my friend's sister.</b>

639
00:36:21,833 --> 00:36:23,250
<b>Can she be your junior?</b>

640
00:36:23,916 --> 00:36:25,250
<b>Please don't say no, sir.</b>

641
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:26,791
<b>What are you thinking?</b>

642
00:36:26,833 --> 00:36:28,958
<b>I'm not sure whether
I'll complete this case itself.</b>

643
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,041
<b>Sir, I just wanted her to assist
someone who knows the law.</b>

644
00:36:32,458 --> 00:36:34,875
<b>- You don't have to pay her any money.
- Do you think I have any money?</b>

645
00:36:34,916 --> 00:36:36,583
<b>- Sir, please.
- Do whatever you want.</b>

646
00:36:37,541 --> 00:36:38,541
<b>Come, come.</b>

647
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:49,375
<b>Poornima!</b>

648
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:51,041
<b>This is the place where

649
00:36:51,041 --> 00:36:52,166
<b>Do you want to pay a visit?</b>

650
00:36:52,208 --> 00:36:54,000
<b>- No, Dad. I need to go.
- Okay.</b>

651
00:36:54,041 --> 00:36:55,041
<b>All the best!</b>

652
00:37:02,791 --> 00:37:04,416
<b>What's the name of the Special PP?</b>

653
00:37:04,625 --> 00:37:06,750
<b>Sir, I heard that it's some guy

<b>He was reportedly

<b>SC number 99/2022.</b>

656

<b>and nothing but the truth.</b>

663
00:37:43,166 --> 00:37:44,166
<b>Chief!</b>

664

<b>Where do you work?</b>

<b>From 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.</b>

<b>Sir, his wife and his daughter.</b>

<b>Their daughter is blind,</b>

676
00:38:12,208 --> 00:38:14,416
<b>- Do you know what happened in this case?
- Yes, I do.</b>

677
00:38:15,208 --> 00:38:18,166
<b>Sir and his wife went to attend
a wedding on that day.</b>

678
00:38:18,166 --> 00:38:19,541
<b>I had gone to the bank.</b>

679
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,625
<b>Since their daughter was alone, I locked
the door and informed her before leaving.</b>

680
00:38:24,083 --> 00:38:26,041
<b>When I came back from the bank,</b>

681
00:38:26,541 --> 00:38:28,791
<b>I saw that she was absolutely terrified.</b>

682
00:38:29,708 --> 00:38:33,416
<b>I knew it when I saw her,
that someone had heinously assaulted her.</b>

683
00:38:33,791 --> 00:38:35,625
<b>I got really scared.</b>

684
00:38:36,333 --> 00:38:37,875
<b>I called Sir immediately.</b>

685
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:38,916
<b>I couldn't reach him.</b>

686
00:38:38,958 --> 00:38:40,208
<b>Then I called his wife.</b>

687
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:41,250
<b>I couldn't reach her too.</b>

688
00:38:41,583 --> 00:38:43,416
<b>When I was clueless
about what to do,</b>

689
00:38:43,416 --> 00:38:45,416
<b>I saw the lady from
the neighbouring house.</b>

690
00:38:45,958 --> 00:38:47,708
<b>I went to her and told her
what happened.</b>

691
00:38:48,666 --> 00:38:50,500
<b>She and her husband
called Mohammed sir,</b>

692
00:38:50,541 --> 00:38:51,791
<b>but they couldn't reach him.</b>

693
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,958
<b>After that, they called the police.</b>

694
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:56,791
<b>Mohammed sir and his wife
got back by then.</b>

695
00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:01,625
<b>That's all, Your Honour.</b>

696
00:39:02,541 --> 00:39:03,833
<b>Yes.
Cross!</b>

697
00:39:05,291 --> 00:39:06,291
<b>Sure!</b>

698
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:13,791
<b>- Seema?
- Yes.</b>

699
00:39:13,958 --> 00:39:15,000
<b>It's me.</b>

700
00:39:15,291 --> 00:39:16,708
<b>How many keys
does this house have?</b>

701
00:39:16,708 --> 00:39:17,708
<b>Two keys.</b>

702
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:18,833
<b>So, you cannot say now</b>

703
00:39:18,875 --> 00:39:23,583
<b>whether someone unlocked the house in
the interim using a duplicate key, or not.</b>

704
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:25,791
<b>- It cannot be--
- Look there and say it.</b>

705
00:39:25,791 --> 00:39:27,333
<b>It cannot be
unlocked like that, sir.</b>

706
00:39:27,375 --> 00:39:28,750
<b>One key is with me.</b>

707
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,291
<b>- The other one is with Sir.
- Okay.</b>

708
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:34,291
<b>If someone duplicates the key that's
with you without your knowledge--</b>

709
00:39:34,291 --> 00:39:36,666
<b>- Who will duplicate it?
- Pay attention to what I'm saying.</b>

710
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:40,833
<b>Imagine that someone else made a duplicate
key for the key that's with you.</b>

711
00:39:41,208 --> 00:39:44,083
<b>If someone else unlocks this house
using that key,</b>

712
00:39:44,125 --> 00:39:45,500
<b>will you be able to know that?</b>

713
00:39:46,791 --> 00:39:47,833
<b>Err.. No!</b>

714
00:39:48,041 --> 00:39:50,958
<b>No! So, how can you say that
no one else has unlocked the house?</b>

715
00:39:50,958 --> 00:39:52,166
<b>But nobody else--</b>

716
00:39:52,208 --> 00:39:55,750
<b>Hey! Just respond with 'yes'
or 'no' to my questions.</b>

717
00:39:55,791 --> 00:39:57,041
<b>Don't try to act smart.</b>

718
00:39:57,208 --> 00:39:59,541
<b>Your Honour, he's scaring
the witness unnecessarily.</b>

719
00:39:59,541 --> 00:40:01,250
<b>She's coming to the court
for the first time.</b>

720
00:40:01,291 --> 00:40:03,291
<b>So?
Shouldn't I ask my questions?</b>

721
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:05,166
<b>Mr. Vijayamohan, what is this?</b>

722
00:40:05,375 --> 00:40:07,041
<b>No, Your Honour.
He cannot intimidate the witness.</b>

723
00:40:07,083 --> 00:40:08,500
<b>I am not intimidating!</b>

724
00:40:08,541 --> 00:40:11,000
<b>I will decide how to frame
my questions for the witness.</b>

725
00:40:11,125 --> 00:40:12,416
<b>You keep quiet and sit!</b>

726
00:40:12,875 --> 00:40:13,875
<b>Well, no wonder!</b>

727
00:40:13,958 --> 00:40:16,541
<b>People who haven't seen even
the court's verandah in years...</b>

728
00:40:16,583 --> 00:40:18,083
<b>are Special Public Prosecutors now.</b>

729
00:40:20,166 --> 00:40:21,166
<b>May I continue?</b>

730
00:40:22,166 --> 00:40:23,208
<b>Yes.</b>

731
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:28,291
<b>Let me finish this!</b>

732
00:40:37,166 --> 00:40:38,166
<b>Seema...</b>

733
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,125
<b>So, apart from you,</b>

734
00:40:40,125 --> 00:40:43,708
<b>only your boss can open the door
to the house using that key.</b>

735
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:44,708
<b>Am I right?</b>

736
00:40:44,958 --> 00:40:45,958
<b>Yes.</b>

737
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,958
<b>It was your boss who sent you
to the bank that day.</b>

738
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,208
<b>- Wasn't it?
- Yes.</b>

739
00:40:50,458 --> 00:40:52,333
<b>What was the purpose
of your visit to the bank?</b>

740
00:40:52,958 --> 00:40:56,291
<b>I had applied for a loan
to renovate my house,</b>

741
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,583
<b>at the co-operative bank.</b>

742
00:40:57,583 --> 00:41:01,083
<b>And the Secretary of the co-operative bank
is a friend of my boss.</b>

743
00:41:01,291 --> 00:41:03,125
<b>So, it was upon his recommendation...</b>

744
00:41:03,208 --> 00:41:04,708
<b>It was upon my his recommendation
that I went there.</b>

745
00:41:04,708 --> 00:41:07,958
<b>That means, your boss knew in advance
that you won't be present in the house,</b>

746
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,958
<b>between 10:45 a.m. and 12:00 p.m.,
on that day.</b>

747
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,750
<b>- Am I right?
- Yes, he was aware of it.</b>

748
00:41:13,291 --> 00:41:15,666
<b>If he had to enter the house
while you're outside,</b>

749
00:41:15,708 --> 00:41:18,916
<b>your boss used to unlock the door
using his key, right?</b>

750
00:41:18,958 --> 00:41:19,958
<b>Yes, that's right.</b>

751
00:41:20,166 --> 00:41:22,541
<b>But my boss returned
only after I got back.</b>

752
00:41:22,541 --> 00:41:23,750
<b>Didn't I tell you?</b>

753
00:41:23,791 --> 00:41:26,875
<b>Respond to my questions
with just a "Yes" or a "No".</b>

754
00:41:31,375 --> 00:41:35,083
<b>If your boss had come to the house
and departed before your return,</b>

755
00:41:35,166 --> 00:41:36,458
<b>would you have known?</b>

756
00:41:37,666 --> 00:41:38,916
<b>Would you?</b>

757
00:41:39,583 --> 00:41:40,583
<b>No!</b>

758
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:43,333
<b>Since this girl was alone at home,</b>

759
00:41:43,666 --> 00:41:45,625
<b>did you lock all the doors
before leaving?</b>

760
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,416
<b>Yes.</b>

761
00:41:48,458 --> 00:41:50,166
<b>Does this house have
a door at the terrace?</b>

762
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,500
<b>Yes.</b>

763
00:41:52,291 --> 00:41:53,291
<b>So,</b>

764
00:41:53,333 --> 00:41:56,666
<b>if this girl had opened the terrace
door for someone,</b>

765
00:41:56,666 --> 00:41:57,958
<b>would you know that?</b>

766
00:42:01,208 --> 00:42:02,541
<b>Answer me!</b>

767
00:42:03,458 --> 00:42:04,458
<b>- No!
- Ah!</b>

768
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,500
<b>You also cannot determine whether</b>

769
00:42:06,541 --> 00:42:09,708
<b>your boss or his wife accidentally
left the door open upon leaving.</b>

770
00:42:14,125 --> 00:42:15,125
<b>Tell me!</b>

771
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:16,500
<b>- No!
- No!</b>

772
00:42:17,041 --> 00:42:18,166
<b>Therefore,</b>

773
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,875
<b>you cannot confirm whether they
deliberately left the door open either.</b>

774
00:42:20,916 --> 00:42:21,916
<b>Right?</b>

775
00:42:22,375 --> 00:42:24,583
<b>Why are you looking there often?
No one is going to tell you anything!</b>

776
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:25,708
<b>That's because she is scared.</b>

777
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,416
<b>The witness hasn't
understood the question.</b>

778
00:42:27,875 --> 00:42:29,208
<b>Didn't you understand
the question?</b>

779
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:30,250
<b>No, sir.</b>

780
00:42:30,875 --> 00:42:31,875
<b>Repeat the question.</b>

781
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:33,291
<b>Yes, Your Honour.</b>

782
00:42:34,625 --> 00:42:35,875
<b>You already stated that...</b>

783
00:42:35,916 --> 00:42:39,625
<b>you can't say whether your boss or
his wife accidentally left the door open.</b>

784
00:42:39,666 --> 00:42:41,125
<b>- Yes.
- And therefore,</b>

785
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:44,500
<b>you can't say whether they deliberately
left the door open, either.</b>

786
00:42:44,541 --> 00:42:45,583
<b>Isn't that right?</b>

787
00:42:46,458 --> 00:42:47,500
<b>No.</b>

788
00:42:48,875 --> 00:42:51,041
<b>What was the response of the parents
when you told them</b>

789
00:42:51,083 --> 00:42:53,666
<b>that you had informed this to the police
before they reached?</b>

790
00:42:56,625 --> 00:42:58,500
<b>I'm asking the questions to you!</b>

791
00:42:58,875 --> 00:43:01,625
<b>Don't you know the consequences
of lying in the court?</b>

792
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,041
<b>You'll be sent to jail.</b>

793
00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:05,666
<b>Her parents scolded you
for informing the police.</b>

794
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:06,708
<b>Isn't that right?</b>

795
00:43:07,833 --> 00:43:09,583
<b>Yes or no?
Say it!</b>

796
00:43:10,125 --> 00:43:11,708
<b>- Yes.
- So, they scolded you.</b>

797
00:43:12,791 --> 00:43:13,791
<b>That's it!</b>

798
00:43:18,958 --> 00:43:19,958
<b>CW2,</b>

799
00:43:20,041 --> 00:43:21,083
<b>Parveen.</b>

800
00:43:21,958 --> 00:43:23,083
<b>We need an in-camera trial.</b>

801
00:43:23,375 --> 00:43:24,625
<b>She is the victim's mother.</b>

802
00:43:27,041 --> 00:43:28,333
<b>Everyone else can step out.</b>

803
00:43:35,583 --> 00:43:36,583
<b>Chechi!</b>

804
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,458
<b>Why is he asking all these
twisted questions?</b>

805
00:43:39,541 --> 00:43:42,458
<b>He will make the prosecution witnesses
say "yes" or "no" alone.</b>

806
00:43:42,625 --> 00:43:44,750
<b>If there are explanations,
the lawyer's intentions won't work.</b>

807
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,583
<b>This is called the art
of cross-examination.</b>

808
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:58,458
<b>Have you seen the accused
who's standing in the dock, earlier?</b>

809
00:43:59,541 --> 00:44:00,541
<b>I have seen him.</b>

810
00:44:01,375 --> 00:44:02,750
<b>When and where?</b>

811
00:44:02,791 --> 00:44:03,916
<b>Can you please explain?</b>

812
00:44:05,583 --> 00:44:08,000
<b>December 26th, Monday evening,</b>

813
00:44:08,583 --> 00:44:11,166
<b>at around 3:30 - 4:00 p.m.,</b>

814
00:44:11,791 --> 00:44:14,125
<b>we were having tea at our courtyard.</b>

815
00:44:14,833 --> 00:44:16,083
<b>- Dad!
- Yes!</b>

816
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:17,958
<b>I'm not coming for the wedding tomorrow.</b>

817
00:44:18,208 --> 00:44:19,625
<b>So, you're going to stay here alone?</b>

818
00:44:19,666 --> 00:44:21,041
<b>Seema Chechi will be here, right?</b>

819
00:44:21,041 --> 00:44:23,000
<b>Seema, don't you have to go
to the bank tomorrow?</b>

820
00:44:23,041 --> 00:44:25,375
<b>Yes, sir. I've been asked
to go there at 11:00 a.m..</b>

821
00:44:25,875 --> 00:44:26,875
<b>Excuse me!</b>

822
00:44:27,416 --> 00:44:28,833
<b>Where is Vinod's house?</b>

823
00:44:30,291 --> 00:44:31,833
<b>The retired registrar's son?</b>

824
00:44:32,583 --> 00:44:33,833
<b>It's the neighbouring house.</b>

825
00:44:33,916 --> 00:44:34,916
<b>Oh!</b>

826
00:44:35,875 --> 00:44:36,875
<b>Thank you.</b>

827
00:44:37,375 --> 00:44:38,541
<b>Dad, please tell me.</b>

828
00:44:38,625 --> 00:44:40,166
<b>- I needn't come, right?
- If you don't want to, don't come.</b>

829
00:44:40,166 --> 00:44:41,166
<b>Do as you please.</b>

830
00:44:41,833 --> 00:44:43,541
<b>So, the accused may have heard</b>

831
00:44:43,583 --> 00:44:46,250
<b>that your daughter would be alone
during the time of the incident,</b>

832
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:47,541
<b>from your conversation, right?</b>

833
00:44:47,791 --> 00:44:49,750
<b>- Yes!
- What stupidity is this?</b>

834
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:51,833
<b>How can she determine whether
someone else heard it or not?</b>

835
00:44:51,833 --> 00:44:53,250
<b>Only the person who has heard it,
can confirm it.</b>

836
00:44:53,291 --> 00:44:55,791
<b>If I say that you've heard
whatever I just said here now,</b>

837
00:44:55,791 --> 00:44:57,041
<b>will you be able to deny it?</b>

838
00:44:57,083 --> 00:44:58,291
<b>Your Honour, what is this?</b>

839
00:44:59,291 --> 00:45:00,958
<b>- Tell me!
- I heard it.</b>

840
00:45:01,416 --> 00:45:02,416
<b>That's all!</b>

841
00:45:02,791 --> 00:45:04,666
<b>Pardon me, for not taking permission.</b>

842
00:45:04,833 --> 00:45:06,125
<b>I was trying to make a point.</b>

843
00:45:06,416 --> 00:45:07,458
<b>Okay, okay.</b>

844
00:45:07,458 --> 00:45:08,458
<b>You may continue.</b>

845
00:45:08,583 --> 00:45:09,583
<b>That's all, Your Honour.</b>

846
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:11,875
<b>Cross.</b>

847
00:45:20,916 --> 00:45:22,500
<b>What was your husband's job?</b>

848
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:24,750
<b>Oh, I'm sorry!</b>

849
00:45:25,125 --> 00:45:26,125
<b>It's not just one person.</b>

850
00:45:26,166 --> 00:45:29,458
<b>Since you have many husbands, you
wouldn't know who I'm talking about, right?</b>

851
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:30,875
<b>I will ask you, one by one.</b>

852
00:45:31,791 --> 00:45:33,625
<b>What was your first husband's job?</b>

853
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,083
<b>Car sales.</b>

854
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:36,666
<b>Broker!</b>

855
00:45:37,208 --> 00:45:39,208
<b>I heard that he committed suicide
due to debts?</b>

856
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:40,250
<b>Is that right?</b>

857
00:45:40,625 --> 00:45:41,416
<b>Yes.</b>

858
00:45:41,458 --> 00:45:44,875
<b>Due to the reason that he fell into a loop
of debts and committed suicide...</b>

859
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:47,041
<b>after his love marriage with you,</b>

860
00:45:47,291 --> 00:45:50,666
<b>none of his relatives are on good terms
with you, right?</b>

861
00:45:50,708 --> 00:45:52,291
<b>Objection!
No relevancy!</b>

862
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:53,625
<b>It is relevant!</b>

863
00:45:53,666 --> 00:45:55,500
<b>Is it my problem if you
don't understand that?</b>

864
00:45:56,083 --> 00:45:57,083
<b>Let me complete.</b>

865
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,708
<b>Yes, continue.</b>

866
00:45:59,291 --> 00:46:00,541
<b>Thank you, Your Honour.</b>

867
00:46:01,791 --> 00:46:03,625
<b>After the death of your first husband,</b>

868
00:46:03,875 --> 00:46:05,833
<b>you had absolutely
no means to live,</b>

869
00:46:05,875 --> 00:46:07,583
<b>and that's when you met Mohammed, right?</b>

870
00:46:07,833 --> 00:46:09,083
<b>- Yes.
- Ah!</b>

871
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:14,041
<b>And you were aware that Mohammed
had a wife and two children then.</b>

872
00:46:15,625 --> 00:46:17,083
<b>Tell me.
Were you aware of it?</b>

873
00:46:17,666 --> 00:46:19,041
<b>- Yes, I was aware.
- Okay.</b>

874
00:46:19,583 --> 00:46:22,583
<b>You had come to understand
that Mohammed's financial status</b>

875
00:46:22,583 --> 00:46:24,625
<b>was far better than yours.</b>

876
00:46:24,666 --> 00:46:26,291
<b>- Is that right?
- Yes.</b>

877
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:27,750
<b>Yes!!</b>

878
00:46:28,125 --> 00:46:29,916
<b>Women who entice married men with children,</b>

879
00:46:29,916 --> 00:46:31,583

00:46:31,625 --> 00:46:32,958
<b>thereby ruining their families...</b>

881
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,125
<b>- Scandalous question!
- What is your problem?</b>

882
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,958
<b>You're always interfering without
allowing me to complete my question!</b>

883
00:46:37,958 --> 00:46:39,666
<b>I'm asking a general question!</b>

884
00:46:40,041 --> 00:46:41,041
<b>Prosecutor,</b>

885
00:46:41,083 --> 00:46:43,000
<b>have a seat.
Let him complete.</b>

886
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
<b>Thank you, Your Honour.</b>

<b>are often regarded as immoral

891

<b>In your opinion,</b>

892
00:47:00,416 --> 00:47:03,166
<b>are such women immoral or not?</b>

893
00:47:04,708 --> 00:47:05,708
<b>Tell me!</b>

894
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:09,875
<b>Purely character assassination!</b>

895
00:47:09,875 --> 00:47:13,708
<b>Cross-examination is not a license

896
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:18,666
<b>Character and reputation of the victim,</b>

897
00:47:18,916 --> 00:47:21,416
<b>are wholly alien

00:47:21,541 --> 00:47:23,250
<b>376 of IPC.</b>

899
00:47:23,458 --> 00:47:25,333
<b>State of Haryana v/s Prem Chand,</b>

<b>Even prostitute has the right

<b>Privacy is a basic right

903
00:47:34,625 --> 00:47:37,791
<b>See, you haven't even understood

904
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,791
<b>And now, since you yourself
have tagged this women that way--</b>

905
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:42,000
<b>Mr. Rajashekhar,</b>

906
00:47:42,375 --> 00:47:44,333
<b>you cannot make imputations

907
00:47:44,375 --> 00:47:47,333
<b>The victim's family and background
are really important in this case.</b>

908
00:47:47,375 --> 00:47:49,041
<b>So, I must ask these questions.</b>

909
00:47:50,541 --> 00:47:51,791
<b>Okay. You may continue.</b>

910
00:47:52,791 --> 00:47:55,375
<b>Tell me.
Is such a woman immoral or not?</b>

911
00:47:55,833 --> 00:47:56,833
<b>Answer me!</b>

912
00:47:59,916 --> 00:48:01,125
<b>Do you have an answer?</b>

913
00:48:04,208 --> 00:48:05,250
<b>No answer.</b>

914
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:08,666
<b>Are you aware that</b>

915
00:48:08,708 --> 00:48:12,666
<b>the accused in this case holds
a very high financial position?</b>

916
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:15,458
<b>Answer me!</b>

917
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:18,041
<b>Are you aware that the accused is rich?</b>

918
00:48:18,083 --> 00:48:19,416
<b>- Yes!
- Yes!</b>

919
00:48:19,791 --> 00:48:21,458
<b>So, she's aware of everything, clearly.</b>

920
00:48:22,208 --> 00:48:24,083
<b>Counsel, conclude your cross.</b>

921
00:48:25,416 --> 00:48:26,416
<b>This implies that you,</b>

922
00:48:26,458 --> 00:48:29,000
<b>who remarried at the expense
of another family's well-being</b>

923

<b>in pursuit of

924
00:48:30,958 --> 00:48:34,791
<b>are willing to exploit even your own
daughter for financial gains.</b>

925
00:48:34,833 --> 00:48:37,416
<b>Furthermore, you have filed
a false case against this young man</b>

926
00:48:37,416 --> 00:48:38,666
<b>purportedly for financial gain,</b>

927
00:48:38,708 --> 00:48:41,041
<b>and are currently providing false
testimony in court.</b>

928
00:48:41,041 --> 00:48:42,083
<b>I suggest so.</b>

929
00:48:42,125 --> 00:48:44,250
<b>For God's sake,
please don't say so, sir.</b>

930
00:48:44,458 --> 00:48:46,250
<b>- He's the one who--
- That's it!</b>

931
00:48:53,583 --> 00:48:54,708
<b>You may step down.</b>

932
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:13,416
<b>Mohammed,</b>

933
00:49:14,625 --> 00:49:16,500
<b>how long have you
known the victim for?</b>

934
00:49:16,708 --> 00:49:17,875
<b>I am her father.</b>

935
00:49:18,083 --> 00:49:19,416
<b>How many fathers does she have?</b>

936
00:49:19,541 --> 00:49:20,750
<b>This is embarrassing!</b>

937
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:22,500
<b>What's the case here?</b>

938
00:49:23,125 --> 00:49:25,791
<b>The blind daughter
of a father and a mother...</b>

939
00:49:26,083 --> 00:49:27,916
<b>was raped heinously
by the accused.</b>

940
00:49:28,291 --> 00:49:31,083
<b>And now, that family's honour
is being destroyed in the court.</b>

941
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:33,375
<b>The accused is standing with his head
held high in the same court.</b>

942
00:49:33,458 --> 00:49:34,458
<b>Cannot be permitted!</b>

943
00:49:34,666 --> 00:49:36,791
<b>There's no point
being emotional in court.</b>

944
00:49:37,958 --> 00:49:39,666
<b>Just like the victim and her family,</b>

945
00:49:39,666 --> 00:49:42,250
<b>the accused also deserves
human consideration.</b>

946
00:49:42,458 --> 00:49:44,916
<b>Until the court determines
whether he's guilty or not,</b>

947
00:49:44,958 --> 00:49:46,541
<b>that young man is
also being humiliated.</b>

948
00:49:46,541 --> 00:49:47,791
<b>Doesn't he have emotions too?</b>

949
00:49:48,291 --> 00:49:51,875
<b>Trials are emotional roller-coasters
for both the victim and the accused.</b>

950
00:49:52,375 --> 00:49:54,750
<b>You should find a way to keep
your emotions out of the courtroom.</b>

951
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:56,333
<b>If you can't do that,
just quit, Mister!</b>

952
00:49:56,375 --> 00:49:57,541
<b>You are not fit for this job!</b>

953
00:49:57,708 --> 00:49:58,708
<b>Mr. Rajashekhar,</b>

954
00:49:59,916 --> 00:50:01,041
<b>you can question properly.</b>

955
00:50:01,416 --> 00:50:02,416
<b>Yes, Your Honour.</b>

956
00:50:04,666 --> 00:50:06,416
<b>Are you the girl's biological father?</b>

957
00:50:07,916 --> 00:50:09,416
<b>- No!
- No!</b>

958
00:50:11,083 --> 00:50:12,333
<b>When you became her father,</b>

959
00:50:12,375 --> 00:50:13,708
<b>how old was Sara?</b>

960
00:50:14,208 --> 00:50:15,333
<b>- Six years.
- Okay.</b>

961
00:50:15,375 --> 00:50:17,208
<b>But I knew her much before that.</b>

962
00:50:17,375 --> 00:50:19,208
<b>Answer only to the questions
you are asked.</b>

963
00:50:19,708 --> 00:50:21,333
<b>Generally, everywhere you go,</b>

964
00:50:21,541 --> 00:50:22,875
<b>do you take your daughter along?</b>

965
00:50:24,416 --> 00:50:25,416
<b>Yes.</b>

966
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,291
<b>You didn't take her along
on that day, right?</b>

967
00:50:27,583 --> 00:50:28,625
<b>That's right.</b>

968
00:50:28,666 --> 00:50:31,666
<b>Wasn't it you who sent the servant
to the bank at 10:30 a.m., on that day?</b>

969
00:50:33,166 --> 00:50:34,166
<b>Yes.</b>

970
00:50:34,291 --> 00:50:36,875
<b>So, you knew that the servant
won't be at home,</b>

971
00:50:36,916 --> 00:50:39,625
<b>between 10:45 a.m. and 12:00 p.m.,
on that day.</b>

972
00:50:41,875 --> 00:50:43,166
<b>- Yes.
- Mohammed!</b>

973
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:47,375
<b>You had a very clear idea
about that day.</b>

974
00:50:47,541 --> 00:50:49,250
<b>After sending your
wife for the wedding,</b>

975
00:50:49,291 --> 00:50:50,500
<b>you went back home,</b>

976
00:50:50,541 --> 00:50:51,958
<b>and did this to your foster daughter!</b>

977
00:50:51,958 --> 00:50:53,208
<b>Don't speak nonsense!</b>

978
00:50:53,208 --> 00:50:55,875
<b>You! You are the actual culprit
in this case. I suggest so!</b>

979
00:50:55,916 --> 00:50:57,666
<b>It's a lie!
A blatant lie!</b>

980
00:50:57,708 --> 00:50:58,791
<b>No further questions!</b>

981
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,833
<b>Actually, who left the door open?</b>

982
00:51:11,958 --> 00:51:12,958
<b>It must be Dad.</b>

983
00:51:13,291 --> 00:51:15,375
<b>If you're asked that,
don't say that it's your dad.</b>

984
00:51:15,875 --> 00:51:17,208
<b>Say that it must be the servant,</b>

985
00:51:17,416 --> 00:51:19,041
<b>or that you don't know.</b>

986
00:51:19,583 --> 00:51:20,750
<b>Why should I say so?</b>

987
00:51:21,416 --> 00:51:22,833
<b>What I'm going to say now,</b>

988
00:51:22,875 --> 00:51:24,458
<b>won't be very pleasant to hear.</b>

989
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:27,708
<b>It's your father who assaulted you,</b>

990
00:51:28,083 --> 00:51:30,500
<b>and what's happening now
is an attempt to cover that up.</b>

991
00:51:30,541 --> 00:51:33,125
<b>That's what the defence
lawyer is trying to establish.</b>

992
00:51:33,583 --> 00:51:34,583
<b>That...</b>

993
00:51:34,625 --> 00:51:36,375
<b>I should be the one
confirming that, right?</b>

994
00:51:37,333 --> 00:51:39,250
<b>I know that it's not my father
who assaulted me.</b>

995
00:51:39,458 --> 00:51:41,416
<b>Moreover, I identified
the accused too, right?</b>

996
00:51:42,083 --> 00:51:45,166
<b>The court needs evidence beyond doubt.</b>

997
00:51:46,125 --> 00:51:48,458
<b>Sara, ours is an adversarial system.</b>

998
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,791
<b>Proving that the accused is the one
who committed the crime,</b>

999
00:51:50,833 --> 00:51:52,416
<b>is the prosecution's obligation.</b>

1000
00:51:53,291 --> 00:51:56,250
<b>It's not even necessary for him
to prove his innocence.</b>

1001
00:51:58,041 --> 00:52:01,000
<b>If they're able to create a doubt in
the case presented by the Prosecution,</b>

1002
00:52:01,041 --> 00:52:02,250
<b>he can even be acquitted.</b>

1003
00:52:02,666 --> 00:52:05,250
<b>Along with that, they will apply
many other defensive strategies.</b>

1004
00:52:06,208 --> 00:52:08,791
<b>And one such defensive strategy
they've applied in this case...</b>

1005
00:52:08,791 --> 00:52:11,166
<b>is to allege that your father
committed this crime, Sara.</b>

1006
00:52:12,541 --> 00:52:15,083
<b>Hence, when you're
subjected to trial tomorrow,</b>

1007
00:52:15,583 --> 00:52:19,291
<b>most of their questions will lead
towards implicating your father.</b>

1008
00:52:20,416 --> 00:52:23,208
<b>So, pay close attention to the questions
and understand them properly.</b>

1009
00:52:23,583 --> 00:52:25,208
<b>And if you don't understand them,</b>

1010
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:26,875
<b>just say that you
didn't understand them.</b>

1011
00:52:27,416 --> 00:52:29,000
<b>In case you understood the question,</b>

1012
00:52:29,041 --> 00:52:31,541
<b>and need time to answer
that question,</b>

1013
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,250
<b>say that you didn't
understand the question.</b>

1014
00:52:34,583 --> 00:52:36,916
<b>The defence lawyer
may create a ruckus then.</b>

1015
00:52:37,458 --> 00:52:39,708
<b>He may pressure you
to respond to the question hastily.</b>

1016
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:42,166
<b>Don't be scared hearing all that, Sara.</b>

1017
00:52:43,333 --> 00:52:44,333
<b>So,</b>

1018
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,625
<b>how will I identify whether
it's a twisted question?</b>

1019
00:52:46,791 --> 00:52:47,833
<b>Trust me.</b>

1020
00:52:48,125 --> 00:52:49,208
<b>You can do it, Sara.</b>

1021
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:51,250
<b>You are an intelligent girl.</b>

1022
00:52:52,875 --> 00:52:54,333
<b>And I will be in the court, right?</b>

1023
00:52:54,583 --> 00:52:56,666
<b>If I feel that you're going
wrong somewhere,</b>

1024
00:52:56,958 --> 00:52:58,333
<b>I will raise an objection.</b>

1025
00:52:58,708 --> 00:53:00,583
<b>I will pick a fight
with the defence lawyer.</b>

1026
00:53:01,125 --> 00:53:02,708
<b>That's a sign for you,</b>

1027
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:04,958
<b>and the time for you to think
about your answer, Sara.</b>

1028
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:31,291
<b>What is your name, dear?</b>

1029
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:33,833
<b>Sara Mohammed.</b>

1030
00:53:34,791 --> 00:53:36,291
<b>Victim has spoken her name...</b>

1031
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:37,833
<b>as is in the records.</b>

1032
00:53:38,041 --> 00:53:40,166
<b>She has been mentioned herein as "X".</b>

1033
00:53:41,708 --> 00:53:44,166
<b>What caused the loss of your eyesight?</b>

1034
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:46,375
<b>Giant cell arteritis.</b>

1035
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:48,541
<b>A condition characterized by inflammation</b>

1036
00:53:48,583 --> 00:53:50,625
<b>in the blood vessels that
supply blood to the eye,</b>

1037
00:53:50,833 --> 00:53:52,541
<b>resulting in the loss of eye-sight.</b>

1038
00:53:53,583 --> 00:53:54,958
<b>What are your hobbies?</b>

1039
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:57,166
<b>I am a sculpture artist.</b>

1040
00:53:57,833 --> 00:53:59,250
<b>I learned it from a very young age.</b>

1041
00:53:59,708 --> 00:54:00,958
<b>Dad is an expert at it.</b>

1042
00:54:01,916 --> 00:54:03,083
<b>He taught it to me.</b>

1043
00:54:03,875 --> 00:54:05,916
<b>What do you have to say
about the incident?</b>

1044
00:54:08,916 --> 00:54:09,916
<b>That day,</b>

1045
00:54:10,833 --> 00:54:12,250
<b>I was alone at home.</b>

1046
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:15,291
<b>Dad and Mom had gone for a wedding.</b>

1047
00:54:16,083 --> 00:54:17,875
<b>Our house-maid
had gone to the bank.</b>

1048
00:54:19,125 --> 00:54:20,125
<b>And then,</b>

1049
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:21,583
<b>I went for a bath.</b>

1050
00:54:23,083 --> 00:54:24,625
<b>Once I finished my
bath and came out,</b>

1051
00:54:25,166 --> 00:54:27,166
<b>I sensed the presence
of someone else in the room.</b>

1052
00:54:28,666 --> 00:54:30,583
<b>He disrobed the towel
I was wearing.</b>

1053
00:54:30,958 --> 00:54:31,958
<b>He...</b>

1054
00:54:32,041 --> 00:54:34,000
<b>used force to push me
to the bed,</b>

1055
00:54:34,708 --> 00:54:36,375
<b>and held my throat and said,</b>

1056
00:54:36,875 --> 00:54:39,375
<b>If you make noise,
I'll slit your throat!</b>

1057
00:55:10,875 --> 00:55:12,291
<b>Does she feel uncomfortable?</b>

1058
00:55:14,958 --> 00:55:15,958
<b>Does she need a break?</b>

1059
00:55:16,916 --> 00:55:17,958
<b>Do you need a break?</b>

1060
00:55:18,625 --> 00:55:19,875
<b>- No.
- No!</b>

1061
00:55:22,208 --> 00:55:23,541
<b>That's all, Your Honour.</b>

1062
00:55:27,916 --> 00:55:28,916
<b>Cross!</b>

1063
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:44,083
<b>How do you identify things
that are around you?</b>

1064
00:55:44,958 --> 00:55:45,958
<b>I...</b>

1065
00:55:46,166 --> 00:55:48,250
<b>identify most of them
by touching them.</b>

1066
00:55:48,458 --> 00:55:51,875
<b>So, you rely heavily on touch
to gather information, right?</b>

1067
00:55:52,625 --> 00:55:53,625
<b>Yes.</b>

1068
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,666
<b>Both in my life,</b>

1069
00:55:55,875 --> 00:55:57,041
<b>and in my art,</b>

1070
00:55:57,375 --> 00:55:58,625
<b>touch plays a crucial role.</b>

1071
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:01,125
<b>Okay. Then, let's talk about your art.</b>

1072
00:56:01,875 --> 00:56:04,416
<b>So, you learned to make sculptures
from your step-father?</b>

1073
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:06,416
<b>Yes.</b>

1074
00:56:06,458 --> 00:56:09,416
<b>How did your step-father
teach you to make sculptures?</b>

1075
00:56:12,375 --> 00:56:13,875
<b>I didn't understand the question.</b>

1076
00:56:14,208 --> 00:56:15,875
<b>I'll elaborate it then.</b>

1077
00:56:16,083 --> 00:56:20,041
<b>Did he teach you to create sculptures
by touching you and having you touch him?</b>

1078
00:56:22,333 --> 00:56:23,416
<b>It's offensive!</b>

1079
00:56:23,625 --> 00:56:25,208
<b>Sexually coloured remarks!</b>

1080
00:56:25,333 --> 00:56:27,458
<b>There's obscenity and innuendo
in the question.</b>

1081
00:56:27,791 --> 00:56:31,333
<b>The defence lawyer is committing
a crime as per IPC 354.</b>

1082
00:56:31,625 --> 00:56:33,375
<b>Victims often find
courtrooms unapproachable</b>

1083
00:56:33,375 --> 00:56:35,000
<b>due to such harrowing trials.</b>

1084
00:56:38,291 --> 00:56:42,041
<b>My question is related to the case,
with the aim of revealing the truth.</b>

1085
00:56:42,291 --> 00:56:45,000
<b>Defence counsel can ask questions
related to the incident.</b>

1086
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:46,541
<b>Confine to facts and issue.</b>

1087
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:47,750
<b>Yes, Your Honour.</b>

1088
00:56:49,916 --> 00:56:52,708
<b>Will you able to recall
what happened that day?</b>

1089
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
<b>Please try.</b>

1090
00:56:56,083 --> 00:56:59,833
<b>When you say that you ran your
fingers along the accused's face,</b>

1091
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:02,625
<b>caressing it, for an extended time
during such a traumatic incident,</b>

1092
00:57:02,708 --> 00:57:04,083
<b>doesn't it sound unnatural?</b>

1093
00:57:04,916 --> 00:57:05,916
<b>Huh?</b>

1094
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:11,083
<b>Engaging in caressing during an act
like rape is impossible. I suggest so!</b>

1095
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
<b>I was scared...</b>

1096
00:57:14,583 --> 00:57:16,208
<b>and absolutely helpless.</b>

1097
00:57:16,250 --> 00:57:17,250
<b>Okay.</b>

1098
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,291
<b>To identify who the culprit is,</b>

1099
00:57:21,041 --> 00:57:23,041
<b>I realized that's the only way
I had in front of me.</b>

1100
00:57:23,125 --> 00:57:24,125
<b>Oh!</b>

1101
00:57:24,416 --> 00:57:26,083
<b>I turned my pain into art.</b>

1102
00:57:26,083 --> 00:57:27,125
<b>Whoa!</b>

1103
00:57:27,166 --> 00:57:28,750
<b>You turned your pain into art!</b>

1104
00:57:28,833 --> 00:57:29,833
<b>Good!</b>

1105
00:57:29,875 --> 00:57:32,916
<b>Then why didn't you tell the police
about such a possibility initially?</b>

1106
00:57:34,291 --> 00:57:35,333
<b>Well...</b>

1107
00:57:35,333 --> 00:57:36,333
<b>Tell me.</b>

1108
00:57:36,916 --> 00:57:37,916
<b>Well, I...</b>

1109
00:57:38,208 --> 00:57:41,083
<b>That means, you never created
such a sculpture.</b>

1110
00:57:41,083 --> 00:57:43,208
<b>- I created it.
- Mere claims won't suffice!</b>

1111
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:45,625
<b>What evidence can you adduce in court
to establish that you're the creator?</b>

1112
00:57:45,666 --> 00:57:48,458
<b>Your Honour, this is an attempt
to discredit the victim.</b>

1113
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:50,250
<b>You continue.</b>

1114
00:57:56,625 --> 00:57:57,750
<b>One the day of the incident,</b>

1115
00:57:57,750 --> 00:57:59,333
<b>no door was broken into,</b>

1116
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:00,458
<b>as far as you know, right?</b>

1117
00:58:03,083 --> 00:58:04,083
<b>No.</b>

1118
00:58:04,458 --> 00:58:06,250
<b>He entered through
the door upstairs.</b>

1119
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:08,750
<b>The police gave you
that information,</b>

1120
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:10,250
<b>but you never saw it, right?</b>

1121
00:58:10,333 --> 00:58:12,708
<b>Otherwise, the only person
who knows this, is your father.</b>

1122
00:58:14,041 --> 00:58:15,666
<b>When you're subjected
to trial tomorrow,</b>

1123
00:58:16,208 --> 00:58:19,875
<b>most of their questions will lead
towards implicating your father.</b>

1124
00:58:20,291 --> 00:58:21,500
<b>- It's not like that.
- Huh?</b>

1125
00:58:22,083 --> 00:58:25,125
<b>Dad, Mom and even Seema Chechi knew it.</b>

1126
00:58:26,541 --> 00:58:29,625
<b>Mom and Seema Chechi won't leave
that door open deliberately, right?</b>

1127
00:58:30,875 --> 00:58:33,291
<b>- Isn't that right?
- In case you understood the question,</b>

1128
00:58:33,375 --> 00:58:35,791
<b>and need time to answer
that question,</b>

1129
00:58:36,375 --> 00:58:38,625
<b>say that you don't
understand the question.</b>

1130
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:40,541
<b>I didn't understand the question.</b>

1131
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:42,500
<b>How is it difficult to understand
this question?</b>

1132
00:58:42,541 --> 00:58:46,208
<b>Your mother or the servant will
never leave that door open deliberately.</b>

1133
00:58:46,458 --> 00:58:47,458
<b>Isn't that right?</b>

1134
00:58:48,416 --> 00:58:49,625
<b>No one will leave it open.</b>

1135
00:58:51,208 --> 00:58:52,250
<b>Oh!</b>

1136
00:58:58,333 --> 00:59:00,125
<b>Since you're an adult,</b>

1137
00:59:00,125 --> 00:59:03,500
<b>you were likely aware of sexual acts
before this incident, right?</b>

1138
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:06,250
<b>- I am aware.
- How?</b>

1139
00:59:06,416 --> 00:59:08,291
<b>Some time back,
you stated to the court...</b>

1140
00:59:08,333 --> 00:59:11,958
<b>that your typical way of understanding
things is through touch or experience.</b>

1141
00:59:12,125 --> 00:59:15,791
<b>Unfortunately, you cannot comprehend
them through sight, right?</b>

1142
00:59:16,958 --> 00:59:19,416
<b>I had eyesight until I was 12 years old.</b>

1143
00:59:19,416 --> 00:59:20,416
<b>Okay.</b>

1144
00:59:20,666 --> 00:59:22,041
<b>While studying in school,</b>

1145
00:59:22,583 --> 00:59:23,833
<b>I had received sex education.</b>

1146
00:59:23,875 --> 00:59:24,875
<b>Oh, good!</b>

1147
00:59:26,666 --> 00:59:28,291
<b>Even when girls grow older,</b>

1148
00:59:28,375 --> 00:59:31,958
<b>there's nothing wrong in parents
expressing their love towards them, right?</b>

1149
00:59:34,208 --> 00:59:35,250
<b>- No!
- No!</b>

1150
00:59:35,875 --> 00:59:37,875
<b>Since you are blind,</b>

1151
00:59:37,958 --> 00:59:40,291
<b>you must be expressing your love
towards your father...</b>

1152
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:41,916
<b>through your hands, right?</b>

1153
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:44,250
<b>Huh?</b>

1154
00:59:45,458 --> 00:59:46,458
<b>I don't understand.</b>

1155
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:48,333
<b>You will be expressing it</b>

1156
00:59:48,375 --> 00:59:50,875
<b>by touching, caressing or hugging
him with your hands, right?</b>

1157
00:59:52,166 --> 00:59:53,166
<b>Not just with my father,</b>

1158
00:59:53,208 --> 00:59:54,416
<b>I do the same with my mother too.</b>

1159
00:59:54,416 --> 00:59:55,791
<b>So, you mean to say that...</b>

1160
00:59:55,791 --> 00:59:59,125
<b>that's how you express your love
to everyone you are fond of.</b>

1161
00:59:59,125 --> 01:00:00,166
<b>- Isn't it?
- Yes.</b>

1162
01:00:00,166 --> 01:00:03,375
<b>That means, you've never touched anyone
whom you don't like, in that manner!</b>

1163
01:00:03,958 --> 01:00:05,208
<b>- No!
- Ah!</b>

1164
01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:07,833
<b>So, from whatever
you've told the court so far,</b>

1165
01:00:07,875 --> 01:00:09,416
<b>you touch someone,</b>

1166
01:00:09,458 --> 01:00:11,583
<b>or allow someone else to touch you,</b>

1167
01:00:11,583 --> 01:00:14,833
<b>only when you have a sense of love
or acceptance towards them, right?</b>

1168
01:00:15,333 --> 01:00:17,666
<b>- I didn't mean--
- Your Honour, vehemently objecting!</b>

1169
01:00:17,833 --> 01:00:20,375
<b>This line of questioning
is misleading and manipulative.</b>

1170
01:00:20,583 --> 01:00:22,708
<b>Her inability to defend herself
due to fear of death</b>

1171
01:00:22,750 --> 01:00:24,416
<b>does not imply
that she gave consent!</b>

1172
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:25,708
<b>This is ridiculous!</b>

1173
01:00:25,708 --> 01:00:26,958
<b>What kind of trial is this?</b>

1174
01:00:27,333 --> 01:00:30,041
<b>Mr. Vijayamohan should refrain
from disrupting the court.</b>

1175
01:00:30,083 --> 01:00:31,125
<b>Mr. Vijayamohan,</b>

1176
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:32,541
<b>I've noted your objection.</b>

1177
01:00:32,708 --> 01:00:34,333
<b>You shall not interrupt the trial.</b>

1178
01:00:35,125 --> 01:00:36,166
<b>Mr. Rajashekhar,</b>

1179
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:37,666
<b>you may proceed with your defence,</b>

1180
01:00:37,708 --> 01:00:38,916
<b>but rephrase your question.</b>

1181
01:00:39,458 --> 01:00:41,708
<b>- Yes, Your Honour.
- Sir, I shall answer that question!</b>

1182
01:00:49,916 --> 01:00:51,041
<b>I touch someone,</b>

1183
01:00:51,166 --> 01:00:52,583
<b>or allow someone else to touch me,</b>

1184
01:00:52,583 --> 01:00:55,000
<b>only when I have a sense of love
or acceptance towards them.</b>

1185
01:00:55,125 --> 01:00:58,583
<b>I didn't resist when he raped me,
solely because of the fear of death.</b>

1186
01:00:58,916 --> 01:01:00,458
<b>It should not be
mistaken for consent,</b>

1187
01:01:00,708 --> 01:01:02,750
<b>and no one has to
interpret it as consent.</b>

1188
01:01:12,875 --> 01:01:14,291
<b>This is quite surprising!</b>

1189
01:01:14,625 --> 01:01:17,166
<b>This is the first time
I'm seeing such a rape victim!</b>

1190
01:01:17,625 --> 01:01:21,000
<b>Remaining unfazed during a rape,
caressing the face of the rapist,</b>

1191
01:01:21,041 --> 01:01:24,166
<b>and subsequently speaking about
these actions in court without shame.</b>

1192
01:01:24,458 --> 01:01:25,458
<b>Your Honour,</b>

1193
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:28,250
<b>we need to re-examine whether
a rape has indeed happened here.</b>

1194
01:01:28,541 --> 01:01:31,916
<b>The intention of this girl and her family
has also become clear now.</b>

1195
01:01:32,083 --> 01:01:34,458
<b>I don't think a girl who
has truly experienced rape</b>

1196
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:36,250
<b>would be able to behave
in this manner.</b>

1197
01:01:36,333 --> 01:01:38,083
<b>How else should she behave?</b>

1198
01:01:38,708 --> 01:01:40,666
<b>Should she bottle up her feelings
fearing humiliation,</b>

1199
01:01:40,708 --> 01:01:42,500
<b>console herself
that it's all fate,</b>

1200
01:01:42,541 --> 01:01:44,625
<b>and remain silent?
Is that what you mean?</b>

1201
01:01:44,916 --> 01:01:46,041
<b>Times have changed, sir!</b>

1202
01:01:46,041 --> 01:01:47,750
<b>Girls of the new generation
aren't like that.</b>

1203
01:01:47,791 --> 01:01:49,125
<b>They will announce it,
loud and clear,</b>

1204
01:01:49,166 --> 01:01:51,291
<b>Who! What! And How!</b>

1205
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:53,000
<b>If you cannot accept it,</b>

1206
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,666
<b>it's because of your age
and your narrow-mindedness.</b>

1207
01:01:55,666 --> 01:01:57,833
<b>Better you try to change, Mr. Senior!</b>

1208
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:04,958
<b>No further questions, Your Honour.</b>

1209
01:02:15,625 --> 01:02:17,541
<b>So, Mohammed is their target.</b>

1210
01:02:18,833 --> 01:02:20,833
<b>The media has enough fodder
to hold debates now.</b>

1211
01:02:21,208 --> 01:02:23,041
<b>We already lack media support.</b>

1212
01:02:26,458 --> 01:02:30,791
<b>Shall we start a campaign on social media,
supporting the survivor?</b>

1213
01:02:32,083 --> 01:02:34,625
<b>If we create a hype,
won't it be beneficial for us, sir?</b>

1214
01:02:35,375 --> 01:02:36,375
<b>It's not the media...</b>

1215
01:02:36,625 --> 01:02:38,291
<b>that makes decisions in the court.</b>

1216
01:02:40,833 --> 01:02:43,041
<b>But... it will make some impact.</b>

1217
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:44,750
<b>Right?</b>

1218
01:02:46,666 --> 01:02:49,000
<b>I know a few social activists.</b>

1219
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,333
<b>We'll make them write posts
on social media.</b>

1220
01:02:51,958 --> 01:02:54,000
<b>Ask your friends also to help us, Ashwathy.</b>

1221
01:02:54,666 --> 01:02:55,666
<b>Yes.</b>

1222
01:03:03,583 --> 01:03:04,916
<b>- Dad!
- Yes?</b>

1223
01:03:05,666 --> 01:03:06,666
<b>Are you tensed?</b>

1224
01:03:07,666 --> 01:03:08,666
<b>Not exactly.</b>

1225
01:03:08,708 --> 01:03:10,000
<b>Rather, alert.</b>

1226
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:13,250
<b>He has been out of legal
practice for several years now.</b>

1227
01:03:13,291 --> 01:03:16,708
<b>A known opponent is much more dangerous
than an unknown opponent.</b>

1228
01:03:17,375 --> 01:03:20,083
<b>He knows my methods
and strategies very well.</b>

1229
01:03:22,625 --> 01:03:24,250
<b>We gotta do what we gotta do.</b>

1230
01:03:25,833 --> 01:03:27,625
<b>Don't worry, Dad!
You'll be great!</b>

1231
01:04:15,875 --> 01:04:16,958
<b>- Good morning, sir!
- Morning!</b>

1232
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,833
<b>- Do you remember everything I told you yesterday?
- Yes, sir.</b>

1233
01:04:19,458 --> 01:04:20,958
<b>- Do you remember the date?
- Yes.</b>

1234
01:04:23,291 --> 01:04:25,875
<b>Hey! Did you meet Michael
after the police arrested him?</b>

1235
01:04:25,916 --> 01:04:26,750
<b>Yes, I did.</b>

1236
01:04:26,791 --> 01:04:28,750
<b>Mention it only if
the defence lawyer asks you.</b>

1237
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,583
<b>On the day of the incident,
by the time you returned from church,</b>

1238
01:04:31,791 --> 01:04:33,916
<b>- Michael had left from your house, right?
- Yes.</b>

1239
01:04:34,125 --> 01:04:36,375
<b>After that, did you get in touch
with him over the phone?</b>

1240
01:04:36,416 --> 01:04:37,541
<b>Err... I...</b>

1241
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,666
<b>After I got back from the church,</b>

1242
01:04:39,666 --> 01:04:41,500
<b>I tried contacting his phone.</b>

1243
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:42,500
<b>But I couldn't reach him.</b>

1244
01:04:43,375 --> 01:04:45,208
<b>Do you go to church every Sunday?</b>

1245
01:04:45,375 --> 01:04:46,375
<b>Yes.</b>

1246
01:04:46,416 --> 01:04:48,166
<b>Do you guys hang out
at your friends' place,</b>

1247
01:04:48,208 --> 01:04:50,000
<b>during the St. Ignatius Church festival?</b>

1248
01:04:50,375 --> 01:04:52,041
<b>Yes. On the day of the festival,</b>

1249
01:04:52,083 --> 01:04:55,041
<b>our families and friends
gather to celebrate together.</b>

1250
01:04:55,166 --> 01:04:57,250
<b>When you went for the church
festival this time,</b>

1251
01:04:57,291 --> 01:04:58,541
<b>didn't you take Michael along?</b>

1252
01:04:58,666 --> 01:05:01,208
<b>No. Michael had left
early in the morning itself.</b>

1253
01:05:01,291 --> 01:05:02,916
<b>He had to go somewhere urgently.</b>

1254
01:05:04,541 --> 01:05:05,541
<b>That's it.</b>

1255
01:05:07,291 --> 01:05:09,625
<b>There's an ambiguity in the date.
I need to clarify that.</b>

1256
01:05:09,666 --> 01:05:10,666
<b>I need a re.</b>

1257
01:05:10,708 --> 01:05:12,291
<b>There is no ambiguity so far.</b>

1258
01:05:12,708 --> 01:05:14,250
<b>The witness has
clearly stated that...</b>

1259
01:05:14,291 --> 01:05:16,500
<b>on the day of
the St. Ignatius church festival,</b>

1260
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:18,250
<b>Michael left Vinod's
house in the morning.</b>

1261
01:05:18,458 --> 01:05:19,458
<b>He said the truth.</b>

1262
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:20,708
<b>He maybe a planted witness.</b>

1263
01:05:21,666 --> 01:05:22,666
<b>You can clarify it.</b>

1264
01:05:22,791 --> 01:05:23,791
<b>Re.</b>

1265
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:26,750
<b>Did Michael leave on Tuesday
or Wednesday?</b>

1266
01:05:27,416 --> 01:05:29,791
<b>Well, I'm unable to say that now.</b>

1267
01:05:34,125 --> 01:05:35,625
<b>I don't remember correctly.</b>

1268
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
<b>That's all, Your Honour.</b>

1269
01:05:44,375 --> 01:05:45,375
<b>You may step down.</b>

1270
01:05:50,958 --> 01:05:53,416
<b>Chechi, why did you say
that Vinod betrayed us?</b>

1271
01:05:53,416 --> 01:05:55,041
<b>He mentioned a different date, right?</b>

1272
01:05:55,416 --> 01:05:57,458
<b>As per the Prosecution story,</b>

1273
01:05:57,916 --> 01:06:00,541
<b>Michael reached Vinod's house on the 26th,</b>

1274
01:06:00,541 --> 01:06:03,416
<b>and this incident happened
during the day, on 27th.</b>

1275
01:06:03,791 --> 01:06:05,416
<b>But as per what Vinod said now,</b>

1276
01:06:05,458 --> 01:06:08,041
<b>Michael returned on the day
of the church festival.</b>

1277
01:06:08,333 --> 01:06:09,958
<b>That is, on the 26th.</b>

1278
01:06:10,083 --> 01:06:11,916
<b>When 27th becomes 26th,</b>

1279
01:06:11,916 --> 01:06:13,791
<b>there will be a conflict
in the Prosecution story.</b>

1280
01:06:13,833 --> 01:06:15,375
<b>That will be a point
for the defence, right?</b>

1281
01:06:16,791 --> 01:06:18,750
<b>Chechi, social media
is raging up, by the way.</b>

1282
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:19,791
<b>I noticed.</b>

1283
01:06:20,041 --> 01:06:21,750
<b>That's not enough.
We need to flare it up!</b>

1284
01:06:22,541 --> 01:06:24,708
<b>- My friends are all actively involved.
- Very good.</b>

1285
01:06:24,833 --> 01:06:25,833
<b>Thumba rape case.</b>

1286
01:06:25,958 --> 01:06:28,666
<b>A blind girl has been assaulted.</b>

1287
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:30,750
<b>A significant amount of time
has passed.</b>

1288
01:06:30,791 --> 01:06:32,583
<b>We are discussing this topic now.</b>

1289
01:06:32,666 --> 01:06:34,583
<b>The Prosecution changed sides...</b>

1290
01:06:34,583 --> 01:06:37,250
<b>and took a stand favourable
to the culprit. That's why...</b>

1291
01:06:37,416 --> 01:06:40,833
<b>the accused got bail from the court
after fourteen days,</b>

1292
01:06:40,875 --> 01:06:41,875
<b>and came out of jail.</b>

1293
01:06:41,916 --> 01:06:43,875
<b>Even before the court
declares the judgement,</b>

1294
01:06:43,916 --> 01:06:45,583
<b>you are creating a
preconceived notion</b>

1295
01:06:45,583 --> 01:06:48,166
<b>that the male is indeed the
perpetrator, most of the time.</b>

1296
01:06:48,208 --> 01:06:49,833
<b>It's natural that
when such cases occur,</b>

1297
01:06:49,833 --> 01:06:52,041
<b>the survivors have to endure
a great deal of suffering.</b>

1298
01:06:52,041 --> 01:06:53,625
<b>Even their names are taken
away from these girls.</b>

1299
01:06:53,666 --> 01:06:55,583
<b>Nobody mentions their names.
They are all Nirbhayas,</b>

1300
01:06:55,583 --> 01:06:57,166
<b>or Kadamakudis,</b>

1301
01:06:57,208 --> 01:06:58,833
<b>or the girl from Chandranelli.</b>

1302
01:07:01,041 --> 01:07:02,250
<b>I'm leaving.</b>

1303
01:07:02,416 --> 01:07:03,583
<b>What is this, dude?</b>

1304
01:07:03,958 --> 01:07:05,458
<b>I didn't tell my parents
that I'm coming here.</b>

1305
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:07,083
<b>I'll call and tell them
that you'll be late.</b>

1306
01:07:07,125 --> 01:07:08,125
<b>No, no.</b>

1307
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:09,875
<b>If they know that I am with you...</b>

1308
01:07:09,916 --> 01:07:10,916
<b>Oh!</b>

1309
01:07:10,958 --> 01:07:11,958
<b>So, I'm a bad guy!</b>

1310
01:07:12,083 --> 01:07:13,791
<b>If you hang out with me,
even you will become bad, right?</b>

1311
01:07:14,333 --> 01:07:15,958
<b>Michael, it's not like that.</b>

1312
01:07:15,958 --> 01:07:18,666
<b>- Since the case is going on...
- I understand!</b>

1313
01:07:18,666 --> 01:07:19,708
<b>Get going.</b>

1314
01:07:25,916 --> 01:07:26,916
<b>Ah! It's her!</b>

1315
01:07:27,625 --> 01:07:28,625
<b>My fiancee!</b>

1316
01:07:29,916 --> 01:07:30,916
<b>Hi, dear.</b>

1317
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,125
<b>[in Hindi] Where are you?</b>

1318
01:07:32,166 --> 01:07:33,166
<b>[in Hindi] I am at home.</b>

1319
01:07:33,208 --> 01:07:35,250
<b>Aren't you on social media these days?</b>

1320
01:07:35,291 --> 01:07:37,333
<b>I had sent you some links.</b>

1321
01:07:37,333 --> 01:07:39,250
<b>- You wouldn't have seen them.
- What happened?</b>

1322
01:07:39,375 --> 01:07:41,250
<b>You've become so famous, right?</b>

1323
01:07:41,291 --> 01:07:43,583
<b>Now, my parents are
rethinking of this marriage.</b>

1324
01:07:46,916 --> 01:07:48,958
<b>Even a blind girl is assaulted.</b>

1325
01:07:49,083 --> 01:07:51,708
<b>Why aren't the law and the court reacting?
That's my question!</b>

1326
01:07:51,833 --> 01:07:53,166
<b>How is this guy able to do this?</b>

1327
01:07:53,208 --> 01:07:54,333
<b>Is he even human?</b>

1328
01:07:54,375 --> 01:07:56,083
<b>- What is it?
- Such guys should not be spared.</b>

1329
01:07:56,125 --> 01:07:57,250
<b>They should be beaten to death.</b>

1330
01:07:57,291 --> 01:07:58,791
<b>What's the point of reactions, bro?</b>

1331
01:07:58,833 --> 01:08:00,750
<b>There should be action.
He should be hanged. That's all!</b>

1332
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:03,625
<b>He's going to marry the Central Minister's
daughter. Will anyone punish him?</b>

1333
01:08:03,666 --> 01:08:05,125
<b>Even such guys are getting married!</b>

1334
01:08:05,208 --> 01:08:07,083
<b>How long will we live in fear?</b>

1335
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:08,708
<b>They deserve capital punishment.</b>

1336
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:11,416
<b>Rapists should be castrated.
That's all.</b>

1337
01:08:11,416 --> 01:08:12,541
<b>He should be shot dead.</b>

1338
01:08:12,541 --> 01:08:14,416
<b>Even I saw some
news on social media.</b>

1339
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,916
<b>It's growing day by day.</b>

1340
01:08:19,666 --> 01:08:21,416
<b>We'll have to do
something about this.</b>

1341
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:24,541
<b>There was nothing
when the case started.</b>

1342
01:08:24,541 --> 01:08:27,000
<b>And if it has started flaring up now,
they are behind this!</b>

1343
01:08:27,208 --> 01:08:28,583
<b>It's a clear case of...</b>

1344
01:08:28,708 --> 01:08:30,166
<b>character assassination.</b>

1345
01:08:38,458 --> 01:08:40,625
<b>13 years back,
I had mentioned once...</b>

1346
01:08:40,791 --> 01:08:41,791
<b>that this curry is good.</b>

1347
01:08:42,166 --> 01:08:44,000
<b>She's been serving the
same curry ever since.</b>

1348
01:08:58,333 --> 01:08:59,333
<b>Who are you?</b>

1349
01:09:00,583 --> 01:09:01,666
<b>What are you doing?</b>

1350
01:09:04,958 --> 01:09:06,000
<b>Mom!</b>

1351
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:07,791
<b>- Dad!
- Let go of me!</b>

1352
01:09:08,541 --> 01:09:09,666
<b>Dad!</b>

1353
01:09:15,125 --> 01:09:16,125
<b>Dad!</b>

1354
01:09:18,375 --> 01:09:19,375
<b>Dad!</b>

1355
01:09:19,833 --> 01:09:20,875
<b>Mom!</b>

1356
01:09:28,375 --> 01:09:29,458
<b>Mom!</b>

1357
01:09:46,125 --> 01:09:47,250
<b>Mom!</b>

1358
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,541
<b>What did you think?</b>

1359
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:22,000
<b>Did you think I would stay
behind bars if you filed a case?</b>

1360
01:10:23,375 --> 01:10:26,125
<b>Instead of accepting the money
and reaching a settlement,</b>

1361
01:10:26,291 --> 01:10:28,125
<b>you're trying to mess with me?</b>

1362
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:31,500
<b>Both social media and the court...</b>

1363
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:33,208
<b>can't do squat to me!</b>

1364
01:10:34,916 --> 01:10:37,666
<b>So, you better withdraw the case.</b>

1365
01:10:39,083 --> 01:10:40,083
<b>Or else,</b>

1366
01:10:41,333 --> 01:10:42,791
<b>just like I showed up that day,</b>

1367
01:10:42,791 --> 01:10:44,083
<b>I'll show up again.</b>

1368
01:10:45,041 --> 01:10:46,375
<b>Understood?</b>

1369
01:11:08,916 --> 01:11:10,208
<b>Do you now realize...</b>

1370
01:11:10,250 --> 01:11:11,791
<b>what all I can do?</b>

1371
01:11:13,458 --> 01:11:15,875
<b>I've fixed a price
for your daughter's honour.</b>

1372
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,625
<b>You better accept that money
and end all this drama.</b>

1373
01:11:25,041 --> 01:11:26,041
<b>Or else,</b>

1374
01:11:26,208 --> 01:11:27,541
<b>I will torch you alive!</b>

1375
01:11:27,541 --> 01:11:28,583
<b>All three of you!</b>

1376
01:11:39,291 --> 01:11:40,416
<b>My child!</b>

1377
01:11:45,541 --> 01:11:46,541
<b>My dear...</b>

1378
01:11:46,583 --> 01:11:47,708
<b>Don't worry.</b>

1379
01:12:11,458 --> 01:12:13,041
<b>How idiotic and disappointing!</b>

1380
01:12:13,416 --> 01:12:15,000
<b>I thought you were sensible.</b>

1381
01:12:15,875 --> 01:12:17,541
<b>We're trying to get you
out of the case somehow,</b>

1382
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:19,000
<b>and you're creating
new complications?</b>

1383
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,625
<b>I thought they might withdraw
the case, if I scare them.</b>

1384
01:12:21,666 --> 01:12:23,291
<b>As if they've withdrawn now!</b>

1385
01:12:23,416 --> 01:12:25,291
<b>Now they are going
to cancel your bail.</b>

1386
01:12:25,416 --> 01:12:26,750
<b>No one has seen that incident.</b>

1387
01:12:26,791 --> 01:12:28,291
<b>I was very careful about it.</b>

1388
01:12:28,333 --> 01:12:29,333
<b>So what?</b>

1389
01:12:29,375 --> 01:12:31,958
<b>- They can't prove it in the court.
- Do you get to decide that?</b>

1390
01:12:31,958 --> 01:12:33,000
<b>Shut up!</b>

1391
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,291
<b>After acting so recklessly,
you're bragging about it now?</b>

1392
01:12:39,041 --> 01:12:40,791
<b>I know how to conduct this case.</b>

1393
01:12:40,833 --> 01:12:42,041
<b>I don't need your help to do it.</b>

1394
01:12:42,083 --> 01:12:43,458
<b>- Yeah, Dad!
- Dear...</b>

1395
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:45,958
<b>Can you appear for this case on June 5th?</b>

1396
01:12:46,333 --> 01:12:48,458
<b>I'm scheduled for a hearing
on Arun Malhotra's case that day.</b>

1397
01:12:48,458 --> 01:12:50,208
<b>It's the Chief Justice's bench.
That's why.</b>

1398
01:12:51,875 --> 01:12:53,416
<b>I have a posting on that day...</b>

1399
01:12:53,625 --> 01:12:55,291
<b>- but it's okay. I will manage.
- Okay!</b>

1400
01:12:56,833 --> 01:12:57,958
<b>Where's your father?</b>

1401
01:12:58,416 --> 01:13:00,416
<b>He has an important hearing
in the Supreme Court.</b>

1402
01:13:01,166 --> 01:13:02,791
<b>Okay! You may continue.</b>

1403
01:13:02,875 --> 01:13:03,916
<b>Thank you, Your Honour!</b>

1404
01:13:05,208 --> 01:13:06,791
<b>Your Honour, this is preposterous.</b>

1405
01:13:07,083 --> 01:13:09,041
<b>Realizing that they're not
going to win the case,</b>

1406
01:13:09,041 --> 01:13:11,583
<b>they've fabricated a false case
to have the bail revoked.</b>

1407
01:13:11,958 --> 01:13:13,375
<b>When there is an accusation,</b>

1408
01:13:13,666 --> 01:13:15,250
<b>what the court needs is evidence.</b>

1409
01:13:15,416 --> 01:13:19,291
<b>And if, as per the Prosecution's assertion,
such an incident really took place,</b>

1410
01:13:19,708 --> 01:13:21,791
<b>they are free to lodge
a new FIR for investigation.</b>

1411
01:13:22,583 --> 01:13:25,291
<b>It has absolutely no connection
with the bail petition in this case.</b>

1412
01:13:26,250 --> 01:13:27,333
<b>Mr. Prosecutor!</b>

1413
01:13:27,875 --> 01:13:29,541
<b>This is a matter
to be investigated.</b>

1414
01:13:29,833 --> 01:13:32,458
<b>Your Honour! It's a fact that
they came and threatened them,</b>

1415
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:34,250
<b>covertly in the dark, like cowards.</b>

1416
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:36,958
<b>As long as this accused
is freely roaming outside,</b>

1417
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,833
<b>the victim and her family
are not safe.</b>

1418
01:13:38,916 --> 01:13:41,250
<b>That's the reason why
we had to file such a petition.</b>

1419
01:13:41,625 --> 01:13:44,000
<b>- Just because there is no evidence--
- Mr. Vijayamohan!</b>

1420
01:13:44,041 --> 01:13:45,291
<b>I can understand your concern.</b>

1421
01:13:45,791 --> 01:13:47,791
<b>So, now you want to ensure...</b>

1422
01:13:47,833 --> 01:13:49,666
<b>the safety of the victim
and her family, right?</b>

1423
01:13:49,666 --> 01:13:51,666
<b>We can enrol them into
Victim Protection Scheme,</b>

1424
01:13:51,666 --> 01:13:53,500
<b>and provide Police protection
for them.</b>

1425
01:13:53,791 --> 01:13:55,000
<b>That solves the issue, right?</b>

1426
01:13:55,208 --> 01:13:56,541
<b>As a Public Prosecutor,</b>

1427
01:13:56,708 --> 01:13:59,625
<b>I can get the State to give
them police protection.</b>

1428
01:13:59,875 --> 01:14:01,583
<b>But that's not why
I moved this petition--</b>

1429
01:14:01,583 --> 01:14:02,583
<b>Call next witness!</b>

1430
01:14:09,375 --> 01:14:10,541
<b>Where do you work?</b>

1431
01:14:10,708 --> 01:14:12,125
<b>At Trivandrum General Hospital.</b>

1432
01:14:12,333 --> 01:14:13,666
<b>As part of this case,</b>

1433
01:14:13,875 --> 01:14:15,541
<b>you have examined the victim, right?</b>

1434
01:14:15,791 --> 01:14:16,833
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

1435
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,666
<b>This certificate has your seal
and signature.</b>

1436
01:14:19,708 --> 01:14:20,750
<b>Yes!</b>

1437
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:23,750
<b>Exhibit P3.</b>

1438
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:25,500
<b>Cross!</b>

1439
01:14:26,791 --> 01:14:28,708
<b>During a non-consensual, forceful act,</b>

1440
01:14:29,291 --> 01:14:30,583
<b>injury is quite natural, right?</b>

1441
01:14:31,208 --> 01:14:32,208
<b>Yes!</b>

1442
01:14:32,541 --> 01:14:35,333
<b>Also, when the intercourse is performed
forcefully without consent,</b>

1443
01:14:35,333 --> 01:14:36,625
<b>there will be injuries, right?</b>

1444
01:14:36,708 --> 01:14:37,708
<b>Yes.</b>

1445
01:14:37,833 --> 01:14:39,541
<b>There are no such injuries mentioned,</b>

1446
01:14:39,791 --> 01:14:40,958
<b>in this certificate.</b>

1447
01:14:41,375 --> 01:14:42,375
<b>That's right.</b>

1448
01:14:42,791 --> 01:14:45,458
<b>To prove that a complete sexual
intercourse had indeed occurred,</b>

1449
01:14:45,666 --> 01:14:48,083
<b>the only prevailing scientific method ...</b>

1450
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:49,666
<b>is the presence of semen.</b>

1451
01:14:50,708 --> 01:14:52,333
<b>Even that does not exist
in this case.</b>

1452
01:14:52,541 --> 01:14:54,416
<b>- That's right.
- That's all, Your Honour!</b>

1453
01:14:55,041 --> 01:14:56,041
<b>Thank you, Doctor!</b>

1454
01:14:56,666 --> 01:14:59,375
<b>What is the date on which the accused
went to CW3 victim's house,</b>

1455
01:14:59,375 --> 01:15:01,583
<b>as inferred from your investigation?</b>

1456
01:15:02,125 --> 01:15:06,541
<b>26.12.2022, Monday.</b>

1457
01:15:06,583 --> 01:15:08,458
<b>How did you identify the accused?</b>

1458
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:11,291
<b>We identified the accused
from the sculpture of the accused,</b>

1459
01:15:11,333 --> 01:15:13,166
<b>created by the
petitioner of this case.</b>

1460
01:15:13,208 --> 01:15:15,708
<b>Did you take the original
sculpture into custody,</b>

1461
01:15:15,750 --> 01:15:17,291
<b>recording it as M.O.?</b>

1462
01:15:17,416 --> 01:15:19,458
<b>As the sculpture is a breakable object,</b>

1463
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:21,458
<b>we photographed it
from various angles,</b>

1464
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:23,958
<b>documented them
and the memory cards in the Mahazar,</b>

1465
01:15:24,208 --> 01:15:27,083
<b>obtained sanction from the court
and safely stored them at the station.</b>

1466
01:15:27,208 --> 01:15:29,375
<b>After that, I had to hand over
the investigation.</b>

1467
01:15:31,083 --> 01:15:32,125
<b>Cross!</b>

1468
01:15:34,041 --> 01:15:36,500
<b>When were you relieved from
your role in this investigation?</b>

1469
01:15:37,375 --> 01:15:38,500
<b>On 20th February.</b>

1470
01:15:38,583 --> 01:15:41,625
<b>If I say that your investigation
was heading in the wrong direction,</b>

1471
01:15:41,708 --> 01:15:43,916
<b>and that's why you were
dropped from this case...</b>

1472
01:15:44,375 --> 01:15:45,833
<b>- Isn't that right?
- No!</b>

1473
01:15:47,416 --> 01:15:50,541
<b>You stated during the examination-in-chief
that the sculpture was photographed.</b>

1474
01:15:50,875 --> 01:15:52,916
<b>Can you adduce those photos in court?</b>

1475
01:15:54,125 --> 01:15:55,583
<b>It's not present in the CD any more.</b>

1476
01:15:56,791 --> 01:16:00,125
<b>Since those photos didn't have
any resemblance to the accused,</b>

1477
01:16:00,125 --> 01:16:01,875
<b>you removed them deliberately.</b>

1478
01:16:02,458 --> 01:16:03,583
<b>I did not remove them.</b>

1479
01:16:03,750 --> 01:16:05,625
<b>When I handed over the investigation,</b>

1480
01:16:05,666 --> 01:16:08,416
<b>those photos and the memory card
were still present at the station.</b>

1481
01:16:08,916 --> 01:16:10,583
<b>I don't know where it vanished
after that.</b>

1482
01:16:14,250 --> 01:16:15,625
<b>Has the CD leaked, PP?</b>

1483
01:16:17,666 --> 01:16:19,583
<b>Regarding the aforementioned sculpture,</b>

1484
01:16:19,666 --> 01:16:21,958
<b>who informed you first?</b>

1485
01:16:22,791 --> 01:16:24,208
<b>The girl's father, Mohammed.</b>

1486
01:16:25,041 --> 01:16:27,666
<b>And the first person who
showed this sculpture to you,</b>

1487
01:16:27,708 --> 01:16:28,791
<b>was also Mohammed, right?</b>

1488
01:16:28,833 --> 01:16:29,833
<b>Yes!</b>

1489
01:16:29,875 --> 01:16:33,125
<b>You were aware that Mohammed
is a skilled sculpture artist, right?</b>

1490
01:16:33,666 --> 01:16:34,750
<b>Yes, I was aware.</b>

1491
01:16:35,291 --> 01:16:38,041
<b>The one who told you that the sculpture
resembled the accused,</b>

1492
01:16:38,375 --> 01:16:40,125
<b>was Mohammed, right?</b>

1493
01:16:40,833 --> 01:16:41,833
<b>Yes!</b>

1494
01:16:42,125 --> 01:16:45,791
<b>And it was Mohammed who first told you that
it was the girl who made the sculpture.</b>

1495
01:16:47,333 --> 01:16:48,541
<b>The girl had also confirmed it.</b>

1496
01:16:48,583 --> 01:16:50,541
<b>Who was the first to say that?
That's what I asked you.</b>

1497
01:16:51,875 --> 01:16:52,875
<b>It was Mohammed.</b>

1498
01:16:53,416 --> 01:16:54,916
<b>The sculpture was not made...</b>

1499
01:16:55,041 --> 01:16:56,041
<b>in your presence, right?</b>

1500
01:16:56,666 --> 01:16:57,666
<b>Err... No!</b>

1501
01:16:57,958 --> 01:16:59,083
<b>And hence,</b>

1502
01:16:59,291 --> 01:17:01,458
<b>you cannot confirm that...</b>

1503
01:17:01,583 --> 01:17:03,375
<b>it was not Mohammed
who made that sculpture.</b>

1504
01:17:06,291 --> 01:17:07,625
<b>Didn't you understand
the question?</b>

1505
01:17:08,375 --> 01:17:09,375
<b>No! I cannot!</b>

1506
01:17:12,375 --> 01:17:13,375
<b>That's it!</b>

1507
01:17:19,541 --> 01:17:20,791
<b>In this case,</b>

1508
01:17:20,958 --> 01:17:22,708
<b>on 20.02.2023,</b>

1509
01:17:22,833 --> 01:17:24,750
<b>the investigation was handed over to me.</b>

1510
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:28,500
<b>I obtained the chemical examination
report and submitted it in court.</b>

1511
01:17:29,458 --> 01:17:31,916
<b>I acquired the tower locations
of the accused's phone,</b>

1512
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,250
<b>and submitted it in court.</b>

1513
01:17:33,791 --> 01:17:37,000
<b>After that, I prepared the charge-sheet
against the accused,</b>

1514
01:17:37,291 --> 01:17:38,875
<b>and submitted it before the court.</b>

1515
01:17:41,333 --> 01:17:45,875
<b>The photos supposedly clicked by
the police photographer on 28.12.2022...</b>

1516
01:17:46,083 --> 01:17:47,083
<b>Have you seen them?</b>

1517
01:17:47,083 --> 01:17:49,625
<b>When the case was handed over to me,
there were no photos.</b>

1518
01:17:50,375 --> 01:17:51,750
<b>From his call details,</b>

1519
01:17:51,791 --> 01:17:55,500
<b>didn't you infer that that the accused
was not present at the crime spot?</b>

1520
01:17:55,708 --> 01:17:58,666
<b>It's the responsibility of the Nodal Officer
to provide that testimony.</b>

1521
01:17:58,958 --> 01:18:02,958
<b>The Prosecution hasn't examined
the Nodal Officer in court.</b>

1522
01:18:03,166 --> 01:18:04,333
<b>Are you not aware of it?</b>

1523
01:18:04,375 --> 01:18:07,250
<b>It's the Prosecutor who decides
whom he wants to examine;</b>

1524
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:09,166
<b>not the investigating officer.</b>

1525
01:18:09,875 --> 01:18:11,916
<b>At the time when the incident
allegedly happened,</b>

1526
01:18:11,916 --> 01:18:15,916
<b>the accused was travelling to attend
a party organised by his friends,</b>

1527
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:19,625
<b>from Thiruvananthapuram to Kanthalloor.</b>

1528
01:18:19,875 --> 01:18:21,416
<b>Are you not aware of that information?</b>

1529
01:18:21,416 --> 01:18:22,416
<b>No!</b>

1530
01:18:24,541 --> 01:18:25,541
<b>That's it!</b>

1531
01:18:25,625 --> 01:18:26,625
<b>Prosecutor!</b>

1532
01:18:26,791 --> 01:18:28,166
<b>Are you marking the call records?</b>

1533
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:30,291
<b>- No!
- He won't mark them.</b>

1534
01:18:30,333 --> 01:18:31,791
<b>The case will lose credibility then.</b>

1535
01:18:37,208 --> 01:18:39,958
<b>Evidence of prosecution is closed

<b>as per information gathered from PW3

1542

<b>the girl told her that she was threatened

1543

<b>It is alleged so.</b>

1544

<b>I don't know.</b>

1545
01:19:25,333 --> 01:19:27,666
<b>It is also alleged that

<b>made by the complainant
of this case,</b>

<b>That's not right!</b>

1549

<b>Additionally, it is alleged that
PW5 identified you as the accused</b>

1550

<b>and documented
the FIR as Exhibit P1.</b>

1551

<b>I don't know!</b>

1552
01:19:41,458 --> 01:19:43,541
<b>It is alleged that PW6
concluded his investigation,</b>

1553
01:19:43,583 --> 01:19:45,333
<b>and presented the charge-sheet
of the same.</b>

1554
01:19:45,625 --> 01:19:46,625
<b>I don't know!</b>

1555
01:19:48,083 --> 01:19:49,625
<b>Do you want to say anything further?</b>

1556
01:19:49,666 --> 01:19:51,625
<b>I am absolutely innocent in this case.</b>

1557
01:19:51,791 --> 01:19:53,416
<b>On the day the incident
supposedly happened,</b>

1558
01:19:53,458 --> 01:19:55,750
<b>I left Vinod's house
early in the morning itself,</b>

1559
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:59,166
<b>to attend a party arranged
by my friends at Kanthalloor.</b>

1560
01:19:59,666 --> 01:20:01,708
<b>After that, while I was
waiting at the airport,</b>

1561
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:03,666
<b>to travel to Amsterdam, I was arrested.</b>

1562
01:20:04,291 --> 01:20:05,333
<b>I am innocent.</b>

1563
01:20:06,375 --> 01:20:08,333
<b>Do you have evidence

1564
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:09,833
<b>Yes! I shall produce them.</b>

<b>Filing 233 statement

1566

<b>To corroborate that,</b>

01:20:14,083 --> 01:20:15,791
<b>I shall produce all...</b>

<b>available materials.</b>

1569
01:20:18,708 --> 01:20:19,875
<b>Can I post it on...</b>

1570
01:20:20,750 --> 01:20:22,333
<b>08.07.2023?</b>

1571
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:24,666
<b>- Yes, Your Honour!
- Will Mr. Rajashekhar be present then?</b>

1572
01:20:24,750 --> 01:20:26,000
<b>He'll be there, Your Honour!</b>

1573
01:20:26,125 --> 01:20:27,416
<b>He will be back this evening.</b>

1574
01:20:28,833 --> 01:20:29,833
<b>Ahaana!</b>

1575
01:20:29,875 --> 01:20:32,208
<b>Verify the tower locations
of the route...</b>

1576
01:20:32,250 --> 01:20:34,208
<b>through which Michael
claims to have travelled.</b>

1577
01:20:34,875 --> 01:20:37,166
<b>If we find a tower location
which is not in Muvattupuzha,</b>

1578
01:20:37,208 --> 01:20:38,333
<b>it will benefit us.</b>

1579
01:20:38,458 --> 01:20:39,791
<b>The towers are accurate.</b>

1580
01:20:40,583 --> 01:20:43,333
<b>Michael's number was latched on
to all of them, right?</b>

1581
01:20:43,833 --> 01:20:45,708
<b>Yes! I verified it.</b>

1582
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:47,875
<b>Ahaana!</b>

1583
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,916
<b>Call Paul Varghese...</b>

1584
01:20:50,375 --> 01:20:53,458
<b>and ask him to procure an information
from the cyber department.</b>

1585
01:20:54,583 --> 01:20:57,708
<b>The first defence witness
is one of Michael's friends.</b>

1586
01:20:58,166 --> 01:21:01,458
<b>He claims that they had food together
from Empire Hotel in Muvattupuzha,</b>

1587
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:03,333
<b>on the day of the incident.</b>

1588
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:06,666
<b>The name of the friend whom
they apparently met over there...</b>

1589
01:21:06,708 --> 01:21:08,000
<b>is Mr. Naveen.</b>

1590
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:12,041
<b>I need all the details about that guy.</b>

1591
01:21:15,833 --> 01:21:16,833
<b>Ahaana!</b>

1592
01:21:17,166 --> 01:21:18,791
<b>The resort in Kanthalloor...</b>

1593
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:22,250
<b>where the accused Michael and friends
claim to have had a get-together?</b>

1594
01:21:22,541 --> 01:21:24,458
<b>- You must go there and inquire.
- Okay.</b>

1595
01:21:26,750 --> 01:21:29,916
<b>I can't find the CCTV footage
of the hotel anywhere here.</b>

1596
01:21:31,375 --> 01:21:32,375
<b>Sir!</b>

1597
01:21:33,375 --> 01:21:35,125
<b>The Empire Hotel is a three-star-hotel.</b>

1598
01:21:35,250 --> 01:21:37,458
<b>How can such a hotel
not have CCTV cameras?</b>

1599
01:21:46,375 --> 01:21:48,000
<b>Well, the hard disc got corrupted.</b>

1600
01:21:48,333 --> 01:21:50,041
<b>Didn't you try to retrieve the data?</b>

1601
01:21:50,250 --> 01:21:52,291
<b>We did try upon the hotel's instructions,</b>

1602
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:53,916
<b>but we were
unable to retrieve it.</b>

1603
01:21:54,458 --> 01:21:56,250
<b>Do you have the hard disc with you?</b>

1604
01:21:57,416 --> 01:21:58,458
<b>Yes!</b>

1605
01:22:09,416 --> 01:22:10,958
<b>- What's your name?
- Naveen.</b>

1606
01:22:11,375 --> 01:22:12,458
<b>What do you do, Naveen?</b>

1607
01:22:12,583 --> 01:22:14,125
<b>I run a workshop
for second-hand cars.</b>

1608
01:22:14,250 --> 01:22:15,958
<b>- Where?
- In Muvattupuzha.</b>

1609
01:22:16,875 --> 01:22:18,375
<b>Do you know that young man?</b>

1610
01:22:18,791 --> 01:22:20,291
<b>Yes, I know him.
It's Michael.</b>

1611
01:22:20,333 --> 01:22:21,583
<b>He's my friend.</b>

1612
01:22:21,583 --> 01:22:23,125
<b>We studied together in Mumbai.</b>

1613
01:22:23,125 --> 01:22:25,541
<b>When was the last time
you saw Michael?</b>

1614
01:22:26,750 --> 01:22:28,916
<b>December 27th, 2022.</b>

1615
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,041
<b>At what time?</b>

1616
01:22:30,791 --> 01:22:32,750
<b>Around noon,
at 12:00 p.m..</b>

1617
01:22:33,125 --> 01:22:34,250
<b>Where was this?</b>

1618
01:22:34,625 --> 01:22:35,625
<b>At Muvattupuzha.</b>

1619
01:22:35,708 --> 01:22:38,083
<b>We accidentally bumped into
each other in the town.</b>

1620
01:22:38,333 --> 01:22:41,125
<b>After that, we had lunch from
Empire hotel before we parted ways.</b>

1621
01:22:41,250 --> 01:22:43,083
<b>Where did Michael mention
he was going?</b>

1622
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:46,083
<b>Michael said that his friends
had planned a get-together.</b>

1623
01:22:46,125 --> 01:22:48,166
<b>So, he left saying that
he needs to attend it.</b>

1624
01:22:49,291 --> 01:22:50,333
<b>That's all, Your Honour!</b>

1625
01:22:52,458 --> 01:22:53,458
<b>Cross!</b>

1626
01:22:53,875 --> 01:22:55,791
<b>I have no questions for the time being.</b>

1627
01:22:55,791 --> 01:22:56,875
<b>I reserve my right...</b>

1628
01:22:56,875 --> 01:22:58,833
<b>to recall this witness later.</b>

1629
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:01,625
<b>PP! What is your intention?</b>

1630
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,541
<b>Your Honour, the CCTV footage
from that hotel has not reached the court,</b>

1631
01:23:05,541 --> 01:23:07,166
<b>and I find that really abnormal.</b>

1632
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:09,458
<b>You are right.</b>

1633
01:23:10,583 --> 01:23:11,833
<b>That's quite unfortunate.</b>

1634
01:23:11,875 --> 01:23:13,708
<b>By the time we approached
them for the footage,</b>

1635
01:23:13,750 --> 01:23:15,250
<b>their hard disc had been corrupted.</b>

1636
01:23:15,708 --> 01:23:17,416
<b>We tried our level best to retrieve,</b>

1637
01:23:17,666 --> 01:23:19,083
<b>but we were unable to.</b>

1638
01:23:19,333 --> 01:23:21,333
<b>I humbly request this Honourable Court,</b>

1639
01:23:21,375 --> 01:23:22,666
<b>to direct the Police,</b>

1640
01:23:22,833 --> 01:23:24,375
<b>to recover the hard disc.</b>

1641
01:23:24,375 --> 01:23:25,375
<b>Your Honour!</b>

1642
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:27,291
<b>We did try our level best
to retrieve it.</b>

1643
01:23:27,625 --> 01:23:28,916
<b>It's a waste of time.</b>

1644
01:23:29,333 --> 01:23:31,666
<b>They can examine the remaining
witnesses in the defence list.</b>

1645
01:23:31,708 --> 01:23:32,875
<b>I think, that will be enough.</b>

1646
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:36,291
<b>Prosecution is directed to produce
the CCTV footage.</b>

1647
01:23:36,458 --> 01:23:37,583
<b>May not be, Your Honour!</b>

1648
01:23:37,916 --> 01:23:39,708
<b>Then it will be an unending process.</b>

1649
01:23:39,916 --> 01:23:42,208
<b>Though CCTV footage is absent,
we have witnesses, right?</b>

1650
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:43,833
<b>That's sufficient to prove the alibi.</b>

1651
01:23:44,333 --> 01:23:45,541
<b>I am posting it on...</b>

1652
01:23:46,708 --> 01:23:48,416
<b>19.07.2023.</b>

1653
01:23:48,833 --> 01:23:51,166
<b>Prosecutor, you must submit
the footage on that day.</b>

1654
01:24:02,750 --> 01:24:04,250
<b>- Mom!
- Dear!</b>

1655
01:24:04,541 --> 01:24:05,875
<b>What happened?
Did you get scared?</b>

1656
01:24:06,416 --> 01:24:07,875
<b>I came in here
to keep your clothes.</b>

1657
01:24:08,625 --> 01:24:09,666
<b>Don't be scared, okay?</b>

1658
01:24:17,708 --> 01:24:19,375
<b>Are you the one who
produced the hard disc?</b>

1659
01:24:19,416 --> 01:24:20,416
<b>Yes!</b>

1660
01:24:20,416 --> 01:24:22,625
<b>Upon whose instruction
did you do it?</b>

1661
01:24:22,666 --> 01:24:24,125
<b>As instructed by the Police.</b>

1662
01:24:27,541 --> 01:24:29,666
<b>Is this the hard disc
you handed over to the Police?</b>

1663
01:24:29,708 --> 01:24:30,708
<b>Yes!</b>

1664
01:24:31,083 --> 01:24:32,750
<b>May be marked as MO 1.</b>

1665
01:24:34,166 --> 01:24:35,750
<b>Have you retrieved
the footage from it?</b>

1666
01:24:35,791 --> 01:24:37,708
<b>Yes, we've retrieved it.
We got it only now.</b>

1667
01:24:41,750 --> 01:24:42,958
<b>May be marked as...</b>

1668
01:24:43,041 --> 01:24:44,208
<b>Exhibit P7.</b>

1669
01:24:52,416 --> 01:24:54,666
<b>When we requested for the visuals
from this hard disc,</b>

1670
01:24:54,708 --> 01:24:55,916
<b>what did you tell us?</b>

1671
01:24:55,916 --> 01:24:57,208
<b>That the file was corrupted.</b>

1672
01:24:57,250 --> 01:24:59,041
<b>Though we tried to retrieve
those visuals,</b>

1673
01:24:59,041 --> 01:25:00,041
<b>we were unable to do it.</b>

1674
01:25:01,666 --> 01:25:02,750
<b>That's all, Your Honour!</b>

1675
01:25:03,041 --> 01:25:04,416
<b>There are many folders in this.</b>

1676
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,333
<b>How do we find the visuals
that we need to see, from this?</b>

1677
01:25:07,416 --> 01:25:09,625
<b>They are saved as clips
up to four hours.</b>

1678
01:25:09,791 --> 01:25:10,833
<b>So,</b>

1679
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,666
<b>in a day, there will be six clips.</b>

1680
01:25:13,541 --> 01:25:14,541
<b>Please come here.</b>

1681
01:25:20,833 --> 01:25:22,416
<b>I need to see the clips
from the 27th.</b>

1682
01:25:23,125 --> 01:25:24,125
<b>From which camera, sir?</b>

1683
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:26,541
<b>PP!</b>

1684
01:25:26,625 --> 01:25:27,958
<b>Which camera should we check?</b>

1685
01:25:28,541 --> 01:25:29,958
<b>The camera at the reception desk,</b>

1686
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,916
<b>and clips from 12:00 p.m. onwards.</b>

1687
01:26:21,875 --> 01:26:24,333
<b>Show the clips from the restaurant
from the specified time.</b>

1688
01:26:50,791 --> 01:26:51,791
<b>Your Honour!</b>

1689
01:26:51,875 --> 01:26:54,666
<b>As the CCTV footage
suffers from no infirmity,</b>

1690
01:26:54,666 --> 01:26:56,291
<b>it's a vital piece of evidence,</b>

1691
01:26:56,291 --> 01:26:58,333
<b>and stands superior to human testimony.</b>

1692
01:26:58,708 --> 01:27:00,750
<b>It's now clear that the testimony
of PW 4 Vinod,</b>

1693
01:27:00,791 --> 01:27:02,625
<b>substantiates these visuals.</b>

1694
01:27:28,625 --> 01:27:30,000
<b>- Sir!
- Don't talk to me!</b>

1695
01:27:30,250 --> 01:27:31,708
<b>This is all because of you!</b>

1696
01:27:48,208 --> 01:27:49,375
<b>I need to talk to you.</b>

1697
01:27:50,541 --> 01:27:51,916
<b>I don't have anything to talk.</b>

1698
01:27:51,958 --> 01:27:53,083
<b>You need not talk.</b>

1699
01:27:53,166 --> 01:27:54,750
<b>But I can say what I want to say, right?</b>

1700
01:27:55,833 --> 01:27:57,375
<b>Why are you getting mad at me?</b>

1701
01:27:57,583 --> 01:28:00,000
<b>Having set-backs in cases
is nothing new, right?</b>

1702
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,250
<b>It was not by chance, right?</b>

1703
01:28:01,291 --> 01:28:02,291
<b>You made it happen!</b>

1704
01:28:02,416 --> 01:28:03,666
<b>What wrong did I do?</b>

1705
01:28:03,916 --> 01:28:05,875
<b>- I need to know that.
- They are lying.</b>

1706
01:28:05,916 --> 01:28:07,416
<b>- Isn't that what you told me?
- Yes!</b>

1707
01:28:07,541 --> 01:28:09,833
<b>- I presumed so!
- Not presumptions, but we need surety.</b>

1708
01:28:09,833 --> 01:28:12,250
<b>You shouldn't have let me done something
that you were not sure about.</b>

1709
01:28:12,291 --> 01:28:13,583
<b>This is Rajashekhar's game.</b>

1710
01:28:13,875 --> 01:28:15,708
<b>Because of you,
I got caught up in this.</b>

1711
01:28:15,750 --> 01:28:16,750
<b>Because of me?</b>

1712
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:18,708
<b>Who worked with him
for a long time?</b>

1713
01:28:19,083 --> 01:28:20,083
<b>Was that me?</b>

1714
01:28:20,125 --> 01:28:21,625
<b>- You couldn't see it coming!
- Yes!</b>

1715
01:28:21,916 --> 01:28:23,208
<b>I lack that ability,</b>

1716
01:28:23,250 --> 01:28:25,041
<b>which is why I
declined this case.</b>

1717
01:28:25,875 --> 01:28:27,958
<b>Who compelled me to take up this case?</b>

1718
01:28:41,208 --> 01:28:42,208
<b>Err... Okay!</b>

1719
01:28:43,958 --> 01:28:45,041
<b>Okay, I am sorry.</b>

1720
01:28:46,625 --> 01:28:48,000
<b>I should have been more careful.</b>

1721
01:28:49,333 --> 01:28:50,416
<b>I admit it.</b>

1722
01:28:53,333 --> 01:28:54,791
<b>I said, I am sorry!</b>

1723
01:28:56,375 --> 01:28:57,541
<b>What can we do now?</b>

1724
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:05,791
<b>I've filed an application
to examine those CCTV visuals.</b>

1725
01:29:06,208 --> 01:29:07,208
<b>Let the results come.</b>

1726
01:29:45,333 --> 01:29:47,750
<b>I want the original footage
and original story.</b>

1727
01:29:47,791 --> 01:29:48,875
<b>What original footage?</b>

1728
01:29:48,916 --> 01:29:49,916
<b>What story?</b>

1729
01:29:49,958 --> 01:29:51,166
<b>- You, bloody--
- Sir!</b>

1730
01:29:55,208 --> 01:29:57,875
<b>For giving a false testimony
and tampering with material evidence,</b>

1731
01:29:57,875 --> 01:29:59,000
<b>I am going to arrest you.</b>

1732
01:29:59,083 --> 01:30:01,833
<b>You will be imprisoned for seven years
in accordance with Section 193.</b>

1733
01:30:01,875 --> 01:30:03,708
<b>- This is enough to shut this place down!
- Sir!</b>

1734
01:30:03,708 --> 01:30:05,083
<b>They forced me to do it, sir.</b>

1735
01:30:05,416 --> 01:30:07,208
<b>- Please help me!
- How do we help you?</b>

1736
01:30:07,416 --> 01:30:09,375
<b>You should have thought about it
before doing all this for money.</b>

1737
01:30:09,375 --> 01:30:10,500
<b>- Come, let's go.
- Sir...</b>

1738
01:30:10,750 --> 01:30:12,833
<b>- Sir, Please hear me out.
- What do you want to say?</b>

1739
01:30:12,875 --> 01:30:13,875
<b>Sir, I swear!</b>

1740
01:30:13,958 --> 01:30:15,458
<b>I didn't do it for money.</b>

1741
01:30:15,875 --> 01:30:17,291
<b>They had offered me money.</b>

1742
01:30:17,875 --> 01:30:19,250
<b>When I said I can't do it,</b>

1743
01:30:19,416 --> 01:30:21,583
<b>- they threatened me into doing it.
- You fool!</b>

1744
01:30:21,708 --> 01:30:23,625
<b>Now it's just you, who is
going to be imprisoned.</b>

1745
01:30:23,666 --> 01:30:25,333
<b>Is there any evidence
against them? No!</b>

1746
01:30:25,583 --> 01:30:26,958
<b>But there's evidence
for what you have done.</b>

1747
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,583
<b>Sir, if I adduce
evidence against them,</b>

1748
01:30:28,583 --> 01:30:29,625
<b>will you rescue me?</b>

1749
01:30:29,708 --> 01:30:31,541
<b>Honestly I had no
interest in this, sir.</b>

1750
01:30:31,583 --> 01:30:33,541
<b>- Stop acting smart and come with me.
- Sir, Sir!</b>

1751
01:30:34,458 --> 01:30:35,458
<b>What evidence?</b>

1752
01:30:36,875 --> 01:30:39,625
<b>Earlier, when I had done something
similar to help my friend,</b>

1753
01:30:40,833 --> 01:30:43,083
<b>in the end he escaped
and I got trapped.</b>

1754
01:30:43,750 --> 01:30:45,791
<b>Anticipating the same
in this case,</b>

1755
01:30:46,125 --> 01:30:47,833
<b>I had done something
to save myself.</b>

1756
01:30:50,250 --> 01:30:51,291
<b>Mr. Vijayamohan,</b>

1757
01:30:51,458 --> 01:30:53,333
<b>what is the purpose
of recalling that witness?</b>

1758
01:30:53,541 --> 01:30:55,416
<b>Some more visuals
that need to be added</b>

1759
01:30:55,458 --> 01:30:58,083
<b>to the already submitted visuals,
have been procured now.</b>

1760
01:30:58,708 --> 01:31:00,375
<b>As far as this case is concerned,</b>

1761
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:02,250
<b>these visuals are very important.</b>

1762
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:04,583
<b>So, kindly allow the 311 petition.</b>

1763
01:31:04,833 --> 01:31:06,958
<b>I have strong objection
to allow that petition.</b>

1764
01:31:07,333 --> 01:31:08,333
<b>Your Honour,</b>

1765
01:31:08,333 --> 01:31:10,666
<b>prosecution has asserted
in this 311 petition that,</b>

1766
01:31:10,708 --> 01:31:12,833
<b>in connection with the
newly obtained materials,</b>

1767
01:31:12,958 --> 01:31:14,500
<b>they need to ask a few questions,</b>

1768
01:31:14,708 --> 01:31:16,208
<b>which is certainly
a vague assertion.</b>

1769
01:31:16,583 --> 01:31:18,500
<b>If the Honourable Court entertains this,</b>

1770
01:31:18,916 --> 01:31:21,166
<b>there will be no end
to the trial of this case.</b>

1771
01:31:21,208 --> 01:31:23,041
<b>Because, in every stage of the case,</b>

1772
01:31:23,333 --> 01:31:24,791
<b>the prosecution or the defendant</b>

1773
01:31:24,791 --> 01:31:26,500
<b>can cite such silly reasons,</b>

1774
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:28,708
<b>and continue to call
more witnesses to the court.</b>

1775
01:31:29,083 --> 01:31:30,291
<b>Finding the truth,</b>

1776
01:31:30,333 --> 01:31:32,416
<b>is the primary objective of the court.</b>

1777
01:31:32,583 --> 01:31:35,583
<b>To do that, if it is essential
to recall witnesses,</b>

1778
01:31:35,708 --> 01:31:37,458
<b>the court must do that.</b>

1779
01:31:37,958 --> 01:31:41,166
<b>Evidences that are powerful enough
to change the course of this case,</b>

1780
01:31:41,208 --> 01:31:43,666
<b>are awaiting
the Honourable Court's permission.</b>

1781
01:31:44,041 --> 01:31:45,041
<b>Petition allowed.</b>

1782
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,125
<b>I was under threat.</b>

1783
01:31:53,833 --> 01:31:55,541
<b>Has that threat disappeared now?</b>

1784
01:31:55,875 --> 01:31:58,000
<b>Sir, I created the new visuals
out of fear.</b>

1785
01:31:59,750 --> 01:32:00,750
<b>Play the visual.</b>

1786
01:32:03,833 --> 01:32:05,583
<b>Your Honour, Exhibit D4.</b>

1787
01:32:06,083 --> 01:32:09,583
<b>The CCTV footage that was adduced
as evidence by the defendants.</b>

1788
01:32:10,166 --> 01:32:12,791
<b>This is a manipulated video footage.</b>

1789
01:32:12,916 --> 01:32:13,958
<b>I will explain.</b>

1790
01:32:25,750 --> 01:32:28,750
<b>Your Honour, in the original footage
of the day when the incident happened,</b>

1791
01:32:29,291 --> 01:32:34,875
<b>they mark two points post 12:00 p.m.,
when the restaurant is empty.</b>

1792
01:32:35,041 --> 01:32:38,291
<b>After deleting the portion
in between those two points,</b>

1793
01:32:38,375 --> 01:32:41,583
<b>visuals shot in the same camera
for the same duration,</b>

1794
01:32:41,875 --> 01:32:44,666
<b>were edited and inserted after
changing the date and timeline.</b>

1795
01:32:45,708 --> 01:32:46,750
<b>Your Honour,</b>

1796
01:32:47,333 --> 01:32:48,750
<b>on the mirror at this side,</b>

1797
01:32:49,041 --> 01:32:52,166
<b>where the hallway leads
to the kitchen from the restaurant,</b>

1798
01:32:52,625 --> 01:32:54,291
<b>a vessel is placed on a table.</b>

1799
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,125
<b>Is it visible to you?</b>

1800
01:32:58,541 --> 01:32:59,541
<b>Yes.</b>

1801
01:32:59,833 --> 01:33:01,208
<b>Now, I shall play this.</b>

1802
01:33:12,083 --> 01:33:13,250
<b>That vessel...</b>

1803
01:33:13,458 --> 01:33:14,833
<b>has vanished now.</b>

1804
01:33:15,375 --> 01:33:17,291
<b>This is the first editing point.</b>

1805
01:33:18,791 --> 01:33:21,125
<b>Now, once Michael and his friend
have left the place,</b>

1806
01:33:21,166 --> 01:33:23,875
<b>let's examine the portion where
the restaurant becomes empty again.</b>

1807
01:33:28,541 --> 01:33:29,625
<b>Your Honour,</b>

1808
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,625
<b>please look carefully at the table
where the vessel was kept.</b>

1809
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:46,375
<b>The vessel has magically reappeared
at the same spot.</b>

1810
01:33:46,416 --> 01:33:47,833
<b>This is the second editing point.</b>

1811
01:33:48,083 --> 01:33:50,416
<b>Your Honour,
though they perfectly shot visuals...</b>

1812
01:33:50,458 --> 01:33:52,333
<b>at the restaurant
and the reception,</b>

1813
01:33:52,333 --> 01:33:53,875
<b>and inserted them
into the footage,</b>

1814
01:33:54,583 --> 01:33:56,791
<b>the reflection on this mirror...</b>

1815
01:33:57,291 --> 01:33:58,625
<b>betrayed them.</b>

1816
01:33:58,791 --> 01:33:59,833
<b>Your Honour,</b>

1817
01:33:59,833 --> 01:34:02,791
<b>he has to be punished with maximum
sentence for deceiving the court.</b>

1818
01:34:02,833 --> 01:34:04,958
<b>- I did it upon your instruction, sir.
- Are you lying again?</b>

1819
01:34:04,958 --> 01:34:06,708
<b>I'll make sure you'll be put
behind the bars.</b>

1820
01:34:06,750 --> 01:34:09,291
<b>We'll soon decide who will end up
going to jail, Advocate.</b>

1821
01:34:10,041 --> 01:34:11,375
<b>In the same pen drive,</b>

1822
01:34:11,416 --> 01:34:12,666
<b>there's another visual as well.</b>

1823
01:34:12,708 --> 01:34:14,333
<b>The Honourable Court must watch it.</b>

1824
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:24,833
<b>Forward it a bit.</b>

1825
01:34:28,875 --> 01:34:31,208
<b>- This time duration...
- Yeah.</b>

1826
01:34:31,333 --> 01:34:34,125
<b>You must place the visuals
shot by me, in this gap.</b>

1827
01:34:34,166 --> 01:34:35,166
<b>I shall do it, Sir.</b>

1828
01:34:35,208 --> 01:34:37,916
<b>And then, you must give it
to me as a single footage.</b>

1829
01:34:38,625 --> 01:34:39,708
<b>Okay, sir.</b>

1830
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:45,750
<b>This is the visual of those

<b>Under a notion that it could prove

1837

1838
01:35:04,041 --> 01:35:05,041

1841

<b>If misleading the court

<b>You may lose your brief,</b>

1849

1850

1853
01:35:39,583 --> 01:35:41,291
<b>Hence, I pray this Honourable Court,</b>

01:35:41,541 --> 01:35:43,125
<b>to take appropriate action,</b>

1855
01:35:43,333 --> 01:35:44,583
<b>against the defence lawyer.</b>

1856
01:35:46,625 --> 01:35:48,666
<b>I will recommend the

1857
01:35:48,708 --> 01:35:50,750
<b>and initiate proceedings

1858

<b>Aggrieved party can approach

<b>Mr. Circle Inspector,</b>

<b>You may step down.</b>

1863
01:36:20,875 --> 01:36:22,125
<b>- Sir..
- Yeah.</b>

1864
01:36:22,708 --> 01:36:23,833
<b>I am so happy today.</b>

1865
01:36:24,500 --> 01:36:26,833
<b>I had seen a similar sight,

1866

<b>But it was you, in place

1867
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:31,458
<b>Now, I believe in Karma.</b>

1868

<b>But what happens there;

1884
01:37:17,875 --> 01:37:20,416
<b>false evidences are being adduced,</b>

<b>When that's happening,

<b>When such criminal lawyers,</b>

<b>Mr. Rajashekhar is a perfect

1893

<b>Therefore, it is unfair for him

<b>[The fame that he achieved being

1895
01:37:48,083 --> 01:37:50,375
<b>His arrogance was over the roof!</b>

1896
01:37:50,500 --> 01:37:51,666
<b>He deserves it.</b>

1897
01:37:51,791 --> 01:37:53,125
<b>He has tortured so many people.</b>

1898
01:37:54,041 --> 01:37:55,833
<b>He will walk scot-free

<b>What can the Bar Council do?</b>

1900

1901
01:37:59,875 --> 01:38:01,541
<b>Haven't we seen this
so many times?</b>

1902
01:38:01,750 --> 01:38:05,583
<b>How come he took up the plea of alibi as
defence, despite being a senior lawyer?</b>

1903
01:38:05,750 --> 01:38:06,750
<b>Desperation!</b>

1904

<b>On one side, there's

<b>On the other side,

1907
01:38:12,250 --> 01:38:15,041
<b>Rather than losing to him,
it's better to hang himself.</b>

1908
01:38:16,208 --> 01:38:19,333
<b>Whatever it is,

1909

01:38:25,416 --> 01:38:26,791
<b>I met the person and spoke to him.</b>

<b>He has come again

1921
01:39:03,375 --> 01:39:04,958
<b>But he hasn't been

<b>He is still a lawyer in court.</b>

1923
01:39:06,208 --> 01:39:08,083
<b>But shouldn't he have some shame?</b>

1924
01:39:08,625 --> 01:39:10,166
<b>Seems like he's on an ego-trip.</b>

<b>He must be planning to do back-seat driving

<b>fabricating CCTV footage

01:42:03,625 --> 01:42:04,625
<b>Robin!</b>

1994
01:42:04,666 --> 01:42:07,541
<b>Do you know the accused in this case,
the one who's standing at the dock?</b>

1995
01:42:09,916 --> 01:42:10,916
<b>Yes, I know him.</b>

1996
01:42:11,375 --> 01:42:13,208
<b>How are you connected to him?</b>

1997
01:42:13,458 --> 01:42:16,375
<b>I am a driver at CJ group of companies.</b>

1998
01:42:18,125 --> 01:42:19,250
<b>He is their man, right?</b>

1999
01:42:19,916 --> 01:42:22,541
<b>Prosecutor, what is your intention
behind examining him?</b>

2000
01:42:22,916 --> 01:42:25,750
<b>Seeking permission under
Section 154 of the Evidence Act.</b>

2001
01:42:25,916 --> 01:42:27,708
<b>To put leading questions to the witness,</b>

2002
01:42:27,750 --> 01:42:29,333
<b>since he is the driver of the accused.</b>

2003
01:42:29,875 --> 01:42:30,875
<b>Okay!</b>

2004
01:42:30,916 --> 01:42:31,916
<b>Permission granted!</b>

2005
01:42:32,125 --> 01:42:33,166
<b>Thank you, Your Honour!</b>

2006
01:42:35,166 --> 01:42:37,041
<b>Are you a permanent
driver at CJ group?</b>

2007
01:42:37,250 --> 01:42:38,250
<b>Yes!</b>

2008
01:42:38,583 --> 01:42:41,666
<b>How many offices does CJ group have?
And at which office do you work?</b>

2009
01:42:42,416 --> 01:42:45,000
<b>They have offices in Ernakulam
and Thiruvananthapuram.</b>

2010
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:46,541
<b>I am the driver at Thiruvananthapuram.</b>

2011
01:42:46,791 --> 01:42:49,625
<b>On Tuesday, the 27th of December,</b>

2012
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:51,416
<b>can you tell me where you were?</b>

2013
01:42:52,375 --> 01:42:53,583
<b>I was at my house.</b>

2014
01:42:55,583 --> 01:42:56,583
<b>Are you sure about it?</b>

2015
01:42:58,250 --> 01:42:59,458
<b>Yeah, sure! I was at home.</b>

2016
01:42:59,458 --> 01:43:01,083
<b>I was on leave for Christmas.</b>

2017
01:43:01,833 --> 01:43:03,166
<b>See! I told you, right?</b>

2018
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:05,625
<b>Does this BSNL number belong to you?</b>

2019
01:43:06,291 --> 01:43:07,291
<b>Err... Yes!</b>

2020
01:43:10,333 --> 01:43:11,875
<b>This is Michael's phone number, right?</b>

2021
01:43:12,500 --> 01:43:13,500
<b>Yes!</b>

2022
01:43:15,125 --> 01:43:17,125
<b>Mobile phones belonging
to both Michael and you...</b>

2023
01:43:17,500 --> 01:43:20,000
<b>On Tuesday, December 27th,</b>

2024
01:43:20,166 --> 01:43:22,708
<b>between morning 6 a.m
and evening 3.30 p.m,</b>

2025
01:43:23,083 --> 01:43:25,333
<b>they were at the same locations,
during the same timings,</b>

2026
01:43:25,375 --> 01:43:28,291
<b>and were found to be latched on
to their respective operators' towers.</b>

2027
01:43:29,708 --> 01:43:31,291
<b>Could you explain how this happened?</b>

2028
01:43:34,541 --> 01:43:35,666
<b>I... I don't know!</b>

2029
01:43:46,208 --> 01:43:49,666
<b>On the day of the incident,
that is, on 27.12.22,</b>

2030
01:43:49,666 --> 01:43:52,166
<b>you were driving a car with
the registration KL-07 AZ 7,</b>

2031
01:43:52,208 --> 01:43:54,125
<b>and this is a photograph of the same.</b>

2032
01:43:54,458 --> 01:43:56,250
<b>We weren't given
copies of the photo.</b>

2033
01:43:56,416 --> 01:43:58,375
<b>We shall serve you the copies;
first let the witness confirm it.</b>

2034
01:43:58,416 --> 01:44:00,458
<b>This is examination-in-chief
and not cross examination.</b>

2035
01:44:00,500 --> 01:44:02,833
<b>If it's a prosecution document,
they must serve the copy.</b>

2036
01:44:03,125 --> 01:44:04,541
<b>Yes! I agree with her.</b>

2037
01:44:04,791 --> 01:44:05,833
<b>Serve them the copy!</b>

2038
01:44:05,833 --> 01:44:07,916
<b>But I need to serve it
only if I'm marking it, right?</b>

2039
01:44:11,125 --> 01:44:12,125
<b>May I continue?</b>

2040
01:44:12,875 --> 01:44:13,875
<b>He is bluffing.</b>

2041
01:44:13,916 --> 01:44:15,000
<b>It can't be that photo.</b>

2042
01:44:15,416 --> 01:44:18,291
<b>If I say that there's evidence to prove
that you were driving Michael's car</b>

2043
01:44:18,291 --> 01:44:20,083
<b>on the day of the incident,
can you deny it?</b>

2044
01:44:20,208 --> 01:44:21,208
<b>Huh?</b>

2045
01:44:23,666 --> 01:44:24,666
<b>Don't look there.</b>

2046
01:44:24,875 --> 01:44:26,625
<b>Look at the Judge
and answer the question.</b>

2047
01:44:27,583 --> 01:44:28,708
<b>I can deny it.</b>

2048
01:44:28,750 --> 01:44:30,333
<b>I never drove that car
on that day.</b>

2049
01:44:44,166 --> 01:44:45,375
<b>Any further questions?</b>

2050
01:44:45,791 --> 01:44:48,541
<b>Mr.Robin, on the day of the incident,
at around 6.00 a.m.,</b>

2051
01:44:48,583 --> 01:44:52,250
<b>you went to Kanthalloor driving
Michael's car, as per his instruction.</b>

2052
01:44:52,291 --> 01:44:54,125
<b>Michael was not present in the car
at that point of time.</b>

2053
01:44:54,541 --> 01:44:55,791
<b>No... It's not like that.</b>

2054
01:44:55,791 --> 01:44:57,625
<b>What do you mean?
Michael wasn't present?</b>

2055
01:44:57,666 --> 01:44:58,875
<b>He is confusing the witness.</b>

2056
01:44:58,958 --> 01:45:00,166
<b>He is not confused!</b>

2057
01:45:00,208 --> 01:45:01,208
<b>Answer it!</b>

2058
01:45:02,541 --> 01:45:04,000
<b>I didn't understand the question.</b>

2059
01:45:04,166 --> 01:45:06,500
<b>While you were driving the accused's car
on the day of the incident,</b>

2060
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:07,958
<b>the accused was not
with you, right?</b>

2061
01:45:09,333 --> 01:45:10,375
<b>I didn't go anywhere.</b>

2062
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:12,000
<b>I didn't go!</b>

2063
01:45:19,458 --> 01:45:20,875
<b>Who all are there in your family?</b>

2064
01:45:21,416 --> 01:45:23,041
<b>My wife, three children and my mother.</b>

2065
01:45:23,291 --> 01:45:25,791
<b>You are working in a reputed company
called CJ group.</b>

2066
01:45:26,250 --> 01:45:28,041
<b>So, you must be earning
a good salary, right?</b>

2067
01:45:28,250 --> 01:45:29,416
<b>I do have a good salary.</b>

2068
01:45:29,750 --> 01:45:33,125
<b>You are paid well because the work
is quite demanding, right?</b>

2069
01:45:33,958 --> 01:45:35,000
<b>Yes!</b>

2070
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:36,291
<b>Amidst your busy work schedule,</b>

2071
01:45:36,291 --> 01:45:37,958
<b>do you get time to
call your family,</b>

2072
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,208
<b>and to attend to household chores?</b>

2073
01:45:41,250 --> 01:45:42,500
<b>Not very often.</b>

2074
01:45:42,791 --> 01:45:44,333
<b>But when I do,
I call them.</b>

2075
01:45:44,708 --> 01:45:46,375
<b>When your family members call you,</b>

2076
01:45:46,416 --> 01:45:48,125
<b>do you always answer their calls?</b>

2077
01:45:48,875 --> 01:45:49,875
<b>Not always.</b>

2078
01:45:50,083 --> 01:45:52,333
<b>I answer when I can
or call them back later.</b>

2079
01:45:52,583 --> 01:45:55,500
<b>Due to your busy work schedule,
you often forget to call them back, right?</b>

2080
01:45:57,666 --> 01:45:58,666
<b>Yes.</b>

2081
01:45:59,583 --> 01:46:01,916
<b>So, you are a very forgetful person.</b>

2082
01:46:02,583 --> 01:46:03,583
<b>Err...</b>

2083
01:46:05,583 --> 01:46:06,625
<b>Yes!</b>

2084
01:46:07,250 --> 01:46:08,250
<b>Okay!</b>

2085
01:46:08,541 --> 01:46:12,166
<b>It's common for such forgetful people,
to often misplace their stuff, right?</b>

2086
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:14,541
<b>Yes, that could happen.</b>

2087
01:46:15,833 --> 01:46:16,833
<b>Okay!</b>

2088
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,750
<b>You often forget
to take your phone, right?</b>

2089
01:46:21,125 --> 01:46:22,916
<b>May be recorded as question and answer.</b>

2090
01:46:26,375 --> 01:46:27,416
<b>Answer me!</b>

2091
01:46:27,458 --> 01:46:30,625
<b>It's usual for you to forget your phone,</b>

2092
01:46:30,666 --> 01:46:32,041
<b>very often, right?</b>

2093
01:46:33,583 --> 01:46:34,583
<b>Yes!</b>

2094
01:46:35,541 --> 01:46:38,000
<b>Yes! I forgot my phone
in the car on that day!</b>

2095
01:46:40,416 --> 01:46:41,500
<b>That's all, Your Honour!</b>

2096
01:46:45,083 --> 01:46:46,375
<b>Your Honour,
I would like to...</b>

2097
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:48,458
<b>reserve the right to recall this witness.</b>

2098
01:46:48,458 --> 01:46:50,375
<b>- For what?
- Awaiting some records.</b>

2099
01:46:50,416 --> 01:46:52,166
<b>I can examine him further
only after verifying it.</b>

2100
01:46:52,166 --> 01:46:53,291
<b>I need a week's time.</b>

2101
01:46:53,291 --> 01:46:54,291
<b>Objection, Your Honour!</b>

2102
01:46:54,375 --> 01:46:56,583
<b>I am posting it for tomorrow
along with the other witnesses</b>

2103
01:46:56,583 --> 01:46:58,291
<b>May not be, Your Honour!
I need more time.</b>

2104
01:46:58,625 --> 01:47:00,000
<b>No! No! Posted for tomorrow!</b>

2105
01:47:00,166 --> 01:47:01,916
<b>If you want to ask anything
more, you may ask tomorrow.</b>

2106
01:47:03,916 --> 01:47:04,916
<b>Next!</b>

2107
01:47:05,125 --> 01:47:06,375
<b>Didn't I tell you?</b>

2108
01:47:06,625 --> 01:47:07,833
<b>He is not dependable.</b>

2109
01:47:09,375 --> 01:47:10,416
<b>I knew it!</b>

2110
01:47:10,750 --> 01:47:12,208
<b>He is their driver, after all.</b>

2111
01:47:13,500 --> 01:47:14,875
<b>I had other plans,</b>

2112
01:47:15,291 --> 01:47:17,583
<b>but the defence lawyer
manoeuvred it in a different way.</b>

2113
01:47:18,666 --> 01:47:20,541
<b>We must prove that
this driver drove that car.</b>

2114
01:47:21,125 --> 01:47:23,000
<b>That's the reason why
I asked for more time.</b>

2115
01:47:23,125 --> 01:47:24,666
<b>But the Judge didn't permit it.</b>

2116
01:47:25,541 --> 01:47:26,541
<b>Well!</b>

2117
01:47:26,750 --> 01:47:29,000
<b>I shall enquire once again
in my personal capacity.</b>

2118
01:47:31,375 --> 01:47:33,083
<b>I need to check those
visuals once more.</b>

2119
01:47:41,750 --> 01:47:42,750
<b>Dad!</b>

2120
01:47:42,916 --> 01:47:45,166
<b>From the locations where
we got our CCTV visuals,</b>

2121
01:47:45,250 --> 01:47:48,041
<b>could they acquire additional
visuals from other angles?</b>

2122
01:47:50,208 --> 01:47:51,208
<b>No chance!</b>

2123
01:47:51,833 --> 01:47:53,708
<b>We have already checked
all the possibilities.</b>

2124
01:47:54,166 --> 01:47:56,458
<b>Even if those visuals are available,</b>

2125
01:47:56,583 --> 01:47:58,750
<b>it's been almost seven months
since the incident, right?</b>

2126
01:48:27,500 --> 01:48:29,583
<b>Ahaana! I want you
to check something.</b>

2127
01:48:30,041 --> 01:48:31,041
<b>Yes!</b>

2128
01:48:31,750 --> 01:48:33,083
<b>I shall go in the morning itself.</b>

2129
01:48:34,500 --> 01:48:35,291
<b>Alright!</b>

2130
01:48:42,750 --> 01:48:44,250
<b>- Ahaana hasn't come?
- No.</b>

2131
01:48:46,875 --> 01:48:47,875
<b>He is in Dubai.</b>

2132
01:48:48,083 --> 01:48:50,250
<b>I can't do anything
without asking him.</b>

2133
01:48:51,791 --> 01:48:53,333
<b>Can you give me your
son's number, Aunty?</b>

2134
01:48:53,375 --> 01:48:55,291
<b>I'll call him and ask.
It's an emergency.</b>

2135
01:48:55,375 --> 01:48:57,000
<b>- What's your name?
- James.</b>

2136
01:48:58,166 --> 01:48:59,166
<b>James!</b>

2137
01:48:59,750 --> 01:49:01,208
<b>How do you know Michael?</b>

2138
01:49:01,458 --> 01:49:02,500
<b>We are friends.</b>

2139
01:49:03,500 --> 01:49:04,541
<b>We are friends!</b>

2140
01:49:04,541 --> 01:49:05,708
<b>On the 27th,</b>

2141
01:49:05,750 --> 01:49:07,166
<b>at a resort called Misty Hills,</b>

2142
01:49:07,291 --> 01:49:09,166
<b>a few of you friends
gathered together.</b>

2143
01:49:09,208 --> 01:49:10,791
<b>- Isn't that right?
- Yes.</b>

2144
01:49:11,583 --> 01:49:14,708
<b>Can you tell me the names of the people
who were present for that get-together?</b>

2145
01:49:15,583 --> 01:49:17,000
<b>Apart from me, Nishanth,</b>

2146
01:49:17,208 --> 01:49:18,208
<b>Jayachandran,</b>

<b>Jayachandran's wife Nikhila,</b>

<b>Mr. Prosecutor,</b>

<b>cross?</b>

2151

<b>No questions for the time being.</b>

2152
01:49:29,708 --> 01:49:32,750
<b>I would like to reserve my
right to recall this witness.</b>

2153
01:49:32,791 --> 01:49:33,833
<b>Objection!</b>

2154
01:49:33,916 --> 01:49:35,791
<b>Witnesses cannot be recalled on
the same day, as it...</b>

2155
01:49:35,833 --> 01:49:37,041
<b>I believe it's important...</b>

2156
01:49:37,083 --> 01:49:39,083
<b>to ensure the accuracy
of their testimonies.</b>

2157
01:49:39,291 --> 01:49:41,416
<b>Yes, yes.
You may call your next witness.</b>

2158
01:49:42,458 --> 01:49:43,458
<b>Nishanth,</b>

2159
01:49:43,541 --> 01:49:45,333
<b>at what time did you reach the resort?</b>

2160
01:49:46,083 --> 01:49:47,833
<b>Check-in was around 2:00 p.m.</b>

2161
01:49:49,208 --> 01:49:51,666
<b>After that, around 2:30 p.m.,
James and I reached there.</b>

2162
01:49:52,541 --> 01:49:54,750
<b>10 minutes later, Jayachandran
and Nikhila arrived.</b>

2163
01:49:55,666 --> 01:49:56,666
<b>That's all.</b>

2164
01:49:57,750 --> 01:49:58,750
<b>Cross?</b>

2165
01:49:59,750 --> 01:50:01,333
<b>Reserve my right to recall.</b>

2166
01:50:03,291 --> 01:50:05,625
<b>How long has it been since
you got married, Jayachandran?</b>

2167
01:50:06,083 --> 01:50:07,083
<b>It's been nine months.</b>

2168
01:50:07,125 --> 01:50:09,416
<b>When you arrived at the resort,
was Michael present there?</b>

2169
01:50:09,750 --> 01:50:10,750
<b>No.</b>

2170
01:50:10,791 --> 01:50:12,083
<b>When did Michael come?</b>

2171
01:50:12,541 --> 01:50:14,375
<b>One hour after we reached there.</b>

2172
01:50:14,541 --> 01:50:16,166
<b>That means, at 3:30 p.m.</b>

2173
01:50:16,375 --> 01:50:17,375
<b>- Right?
- Yes.</b>

2174
01:50:18,458 --> 01:50:19,500
<b>That's all.</b>

2175
01:50:19,958 --> 01:50:20,958
<b>Cross?</b>

2176
01:50:21,166 --> 01:50:23,000
<b>No cross.
Reserve my right to recall.</b>

2177
01:50:24,333 --> 01:50:25,916
<b>What is your father's name, Nikhila?</b>

2178
01:50:26,875 --> 01:50:28,041
<b>MK Ramachandran.</b>

2179
01:50:28,250 --> 01:50:29,291
<b>What does he do?</b>

2180
01:50:30,583 --> 01:50:31,625
<b>He's the Director General of Police.</b>

2181
01:50:31,625 --> 01:50:34,333
<b>Oh! So, you're the daughter of
the Police Chief of the State, huh?</b>

2182
01:50:36,375 --> 01:50:36,791
<b>Yes.</b>

2183
01:50:36,833 --> 01:50:40,375
<b>Nikhila, you had also gone for
Jayachandran's friend's party on the 27th.</b>

2184
01:50:40,375 --> 01:50:41,375
<b>Right?</b>

2185
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:44,000
<b>Yes.</b>

2186
01:50:44,250 --> 01:50:46,791
<b>Are you acquainted with
the accused Michael?</b>

2187
01:50:48,750 --> 01:50:50,416
<b>He is my husband's friend.</b>

2188
01:50:50,875 --> 01:50:52,750
<b>But I met him
for the first time over there.</b>

2189
01:50:53,916 --> 01:50:55,041
<b>On the day of the incident,</b>

2190
01:50:55,083 --> 01:50:57,083
<b>at what time did Michael
reach the resort?</b>

2191
01:50:58,833 --> 01:51:00,000
<b>At 3:30 p.m.</b>

2192
01:51:00,375 --> 01:51:01,958
<b>When did the party get over?</b>

2193
01:51:03,166 --> 01:51:04,708
<b>Must be around 2:00 a.m. in the night.</b>

2194
01:51:04,958 --> 01:51:06,250
<b>When did you guys disperse?</b>

2195
01:51:07,791 --> 01:51:09,250
<b>Next day morning,
at 11:30 a.m.</b>

2196
01:51:09,625 --> 01:51:11,083
<b>No further questions, Your Honour.</b>

2197
01:51:11,833 --> 01:51:12,833
<b>No cross, right?</b>

2198
01:51:13,041 --> 01:51:14,833
<b>- Yes. But I reserve my right--
- Yeah, yeah!</b>

2199
01:51:14,875 --> 01:51:15,875
<b>I'm writing that too.</b>

2200
01:51:22,208 --> 01:51:23,208
<b>What do you do?</b>

2201
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:25,250
<b>I run a resort named Misty Hills.</b>

2202
01:51:26,208 --> 01:51:27,583
<b>The person standing
in that dock...</b>

2203
01:51:27,625 --> 01:51:28,958
<b>Have you seen him earlier?</b>

2204
01:51:29,041 --> 01:51:30,583
<b>- Yes.
- How?</b>

2205
01:51:31,166 --> 01:51:32,500
<b>On TV and the newspapers.</b>

2206
01:51:32,541 --> 01:51:34,625
<b>Not that.
Have you seen him in person?</b>

2207
01:51:35,041 --> 01:51:38,666
<b>I've seen him. Him and his friends
had stayed at my resort for one day.</b>

2208
01:51:39,083 --> 01:51:40,083
<b>When was that?</b>

2209
01:51:40,416 --> 01:51:42,125
<b>27.12.2022.</b>

2210
01:51:42,291 --> 01:51:43,541
<b>They checked out the next day.</b>

2211
01:51:44,125 --> 01:51:45,125
<b>That's all, Your Honour.</b>

2212
01:51:45,375 --> 01:51:48,041
<b>Prosecutor, do you want
to ask anything, or again...?</b>

2213
01:51:53,666 --> 01:51:56,208
<b>Do you know what's the punishment
for giving a false testimony?</b>

2214
01:51:56,333 --> 01:51:57,333
<b>I know.</b>

2215
01:51:57,375 --> 01:51:59,458
<b>As per Section 193 IPC,</b>

2216
01:51:59,458 --> 01:52:00,666
<b>seven years in prison.</b>

2217
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:02,083
<b>I'm also a lawyer.</b>

2218
01:52:02,291 --> 01:52:03,708
<b>Just that I'm not practising.</b>

2219
01:52:08,208 --> 01:52:09,208
<b>In your resort,</b>

2220
01:52:09,541 --> 01:52:11,000
<b>do you have CCTV cameras?</b>

2221
01:52:11,416 --> 01:52:12,291
<b>No.</b>

2222
01:52:12,333 --> 01:52:13,791
<b>How come you haven't installed any?</b>

2223
01:52:14,166 --> 01:52:15,416
<b>I felt they were unnecessary.</b>

2224
01:52:16,083 --> 01:52:17,083
<b>Oh!</b>

2225
01:52:17,125 --> 01:52:18,833
<b>Must be because
you're well-versed in law.</b>

2226
01:52:42,083 --> 01:52:44,458
<b>Now, I would like to recall
Michael's friends.</b>

2227
01:52:54,708 --> 01:52:55,708
<b>Your Honour,</b>

2228
01:52:55,833 --> 01:52:58,958
<b>the three other witnesses
should be shifted outside the courtroom.</b>

2229
01:52:59,500 --> 01:53:00,625
<b>Objection, Your Honour.</b>

2230
01:53:00,625 --> 01:53:03,708
<b>It is essential that all witnesses should
be present to ensure transparency.</b>

2231
01:53:03,708 --> 01:53:07,083
<b>Your Honour, my intention is to prevent
any possibility of collusion.</b>

2232
01:53:07,458 --> 01:53:10,083
<b>The testimonies should
not influence each other.</b>

2233
01:53:10,291 --> 01:53:11,500
<b>I understood your concerns.</b>

2234
01:53:12,333 --> 01:53:13,791
<b>The three of you, please step out.</b>

2235
01:53:18,666 --> 01:53:20,125
<b>As per your statement,</b>

2236
01:53:20,125 --> 01:53:22,833
<b>on the 27th, at 3:30 p.m. in the afternoon,</b>

2237
01:53:22,875 --> 01:53:25,333
<b>Michael arrived at the resort
driving his own car.</b>

2238
01:53:25,666 --> 01:53:26,416
<b>Yes.</b>

2239
01:53:26,416 --> 01:53:27,791
<b>How can you state the time</b>

2240
01:53:27,833 --> 01:53:30,625
<b>and the fact that he came there
driving his own car, so precisely?</b>

2241
01:53:31,083 --> 01:53:32,791
<b>- Did you see him coming?
- Yes.</b>

2242
01:53:33,666 --> 01:53:35,750
<b>We checked in around 2:30 p.m.</b>

2243
01:53:36,083 --> 01:53:38,958
<b>At 3:30 p.m., we stepped out
to check out the resort premises.</b>

2244
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:40,916
<b>That's when we saw
Michael arriving in his car.</b>

2245
01:54:00,416 --> 01:54:01,875
<b>In which car did Michael come?</b>

2246
01:54:02,250 --> 01:54:03,541
<b>- Huh?
- What make?</b>

2247
01:54:04,041 --> 01:54:05,291
<b>- Honda Civic.
- Colour?</b>

2248
01:54:05,416 --> 01:54:07,500
<b>- Blue.
- What dress was Michael wearing?</b>

2249
01:54:08,416 --> 01:54:10,250
<b>What dress was Michael wearing?</b>

2250
01:54:10,333 --> 01:54:11,333
<b>Objection!</b>

2251
01:54:11,375 --> 01:54:14,458
<b>Will anyone remember what dress
a person was wearing eight months ago?</b>

2252
01:54:15,041 --> 01:54:17,666
<b>- I don't remember.
- You remember everything else.</b>

2253
01:54:17,708 --> 01:54:19,416
<b>And if you say you don't
remember this alone,</b>

2254
01:54:19,416 --> 01:54:22,125
<b>- I find it difficult to believe.
- I swear, I don't remember it.</b>

2255
01:54:22,125 --> 01:54:24,125
<b>No. Michael never
came there on that day.</b>

2256
01:54:24,166 --> 01:54:25,791
<b>And you never saw Michael.
Right?</b>

2257
01:54:26,500 --> 01:54:27,500
<b>Err...</b>

2258
01:54:30,416 --> 01:54:32,041
<b>- The make of the car?
- Honda Civic.</b>

2259
01:54:32,083 --> 01:54:33,333
<b>- Colour?
- Blue.</b>

2260
01:54:33,666 --> 01:54:35,500
<b>What dress was Michael
wearing on that day?</b>

2261
01:54:36,291 --> 01:54:39,083
<b>Your friend James told us
that the attire was jeans and a T-shirt.</b>

2262
01:54:40,708 --> 01:54:42,833
<b>Don't look there.
Look at the Judge and say it.</b>

2263
01:54:44,791 --> 01:54:46,583
<b>He was wearing a pair
of jeans and a T-shirt.</b>

2264
01:54:46,625 --> 01:54:47,625
<b>What colour?</b>

2265
01:54:47,958 --> 01:54:49,916
<b>- Colour...?
- What pattern?</b>

2266
01:54:50,041 --> 01:54:51,041
<b>Full sleeve?</b>

2267
01:54:51,250 --> 01:54:53,041
<b>Half-sleeve?
Round neck?</b>

2268
01:54:53,416 --> 01:54:54,416
<b>Or with collar?</b>

2269
01:54:55,083 --> 01:54:56,708
<b>This is to discredit the witness.</b>

2270
01:54:56,833 --> 01:54:58,666
<b>Forget colour.
He's asking for the pattern also now.</b>

2271
01:54:58,708 --> 01:55:01,083
<b>So, you forgot to teach them
the colour and pattern, right?</b>

2272
01:55:04,916 --> 01:55:07,166
<b>Michael never went there on that day,</b>

2273
01:55:07,583 --> 01:55:10,125
<b>and they're giving false
testimonies before the court.</b>

2274
01:55:10,166 --> 01:55:11,208
<b>I suggest so.</b>

2275
01:55:11,541 --> 01:55:12,625
<b>No. He came there.</b>

2276
01:55:12,916 --> 01:55:14,541
<b>What dress was he wearing that day?</b>

2277
01:55:14,875 --> 01:55:16,333
<b>Err... Pants and shirt.</b>

2278
01:55:16,583 --> 01:55:18,916
<b>Your friend said that the attire
was Jeans and a T-shirt.</b>

2279
01:55:18,958 --> 01:55:21,208
<b>Hello! Don't look there.
Look here and say it.</b>

2280
01:55:22,291 --> 01:55:23,291
<b>I don't remember.</b>

2281
01:55:23,500 --> 01:55:25,625
<b>You remember everything else correctly.</b>

2282
01:55:25,625 --> 01:55:27,250
<b>How did you forget this alone?</b>

2283
01:55:28,208 --> 01:55:30,791
<b>Don't you remember at least the colour?</b>

2284
01:55:31,708 --> 01:55:32,708
<b>Pattern?</b>

2285
01:55:33,541 --> 01:55:34,541
<b>Full sleeve?</b>

2286
01:55:35,416 --> 01:55:36,416
<b>Half sleeve?</b>

2287
01:55:38,875 --> 01:55:40,791
<b>No answer.
May be recorded.</b>

2288
01:55:42,291 --> 01:55:43,333
<b>You may step down.</b>

2289
01:55:51,458 --> 01:55:53,041
<b>Which car did Michael come in?</b>

2290
01:55:54,750 --> 01:55:55,958
<b>I mean, what make?</b>

2291
01:55:57,166 --> 01:55:58,250
<b>You don't know?</b>

2292
01:55:58,416 --> 01:56:00,541
<b>It's alright. We'll consider
that you didn't notice it.</b>

2293
01:56:00,875 --> 01:56:02,541
<b>But you won't forget
the colour, right?</b>

2294
01:56:03,583 --> 01:56:05,166
<b>- That...
- You don't know that either?</b>

2295
01:56:06,416 --> 01:56:08,250
<b>What dress was Michael wearing
on that day?</b>

2296
01:56:08,625 --> 01:56:09,708
<b>What colour?</b>

2297
01:56:09,916 --> 01:56:11,208
<b>What pattern?
T-shirt?</b>

2298
01:56:12,083 --> 01:56:14,083
<b>Shirt?
Full sleeve? Half sleeve?</b>

2299
01:56:15,333 --> 01:56:17,958
<b>In reality, you never
saw Michael over there.</b>

2300
01:56:18,208 --> 01:56:19,208
<b>You haven't seen him!</b>

2301
01:56:19,291 --> 01:56:21,083
<b>Because Michael never came there.</b>

2302
01:56:21,708 --> 01:56:23,458
<b>Your husband and his friends,</b>

2303
01:56:23,500 --> 01:56:25,291
<b>didn't have answers for my questions.</b>

2304
01:56:25,875 --> 01:56:27,375
<b>The court has understood the truth.</b>

2305
01:56:27,416 --> 01:56:29,625
<b>At least now,
please open up, sincerely.</b>

2306
01:56:30,333 --> 01:56:33,625
<b>You're the daughter of the highest
ranking police official of this State.</b>

2307
01:56:33,625 --> 01:56:34,625
<b>Objection, Your Honour.</b>

2308
01:56:34,708 --> 01:56:35,875
<b>He's harassing my witness.</b>

2309
01:56:37,125 --> 01:56:38,333
<b>Prosecutor!</b>

2310
01:56:39,583 --> 01:56:40,625
<b>Yes, Your Honour.</b>

2311
01:56:42,041 --> 01:56:44,166
<b>I can understand the others saying so.</b>

2312
01:56:44,583 --> 01:56:46,291
<b>They are Michael's friends.</b>

2313
01:56:46,500 --> 01:56:47,791
<b>But you are not like that.</b>

2314
01:56:47,875 --> 01:56:49,208
<b>You are a woman.</b>

2315
01:56:49,666 --> 01:56:54,375
<b>You're standing against a blind girl,
who was subjected to a heinous rape.</b>

2316
01:56:54,916 --> 01:56:56,541
<b>This may happen to you also tomorrow.</b>

2317
01:56:56,875 --> 01:56:58,083
<b>To your sister,</b>

2318
01:56:58,583 --> 01:56:59,958
<b>or your friend or anyone else.</b>

2319
01:57:00,750 --> 01:57:04,041
<b>You must show the courage to speak
out the truth, at least now.</b>

2320
01:57:10,375 --> 01:57:11,708
<b>I don't know anything, sir.</b>

2321
01:57:13,666 --> 01:57:15,000
<b>I don't have anything to say.</b>

2322
01:57:19,333 --> 01:57:21,208
<b>You have said it

2323
01:57:24,333 --> 01:57:25,333
<b>You may step down.</b>

2324
01:57:33,125 --> 01:57:34,125
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

2325
01:57:46,750 --> 01:57:48,208
<b>Sir, Ahaana Chechi.</b>

2326
01:58:07,166 --> 01:58:08,166
<b>Without interruption...</b>

2327
01:58:08,208 --> 01:58:09,208
<b>You are interrupting!</b>

2328
01:58:09,458 --> 01:58:12,583
<b>Pardon me! Filing a petition
to accept an electronic evidence...</b>

2329
01:58:13,250 --> 01:58:14,958
<b>with 65B Certificate.</b>

2330
01:58:15,666 --> 01:58:17,083
<b>Copy not served.</b>

2331
01:58:17,166 --> 01:58:18,166
<b>I shall.</b>

2332
01:58:18,291 --> 01:58:19,333
<b>Mr. Vijayamohan,</b>

2333
01:58:19,708 --> 01:58:21,958
<b>I will not entertain this kind
of practice in my Court.</b>

2334
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,458
<b>The aim of every court
is to discover the truth.</b>

2335
01:58:24,500 --> 01:58:27,958
<b>Section 311 CrPC is one
of many such provisions...</b>

2336
01:58:28,083 --> 01:58:29,750
<b>which strengthen the arms of a court,</b>

2337
01:58:30,041 --> 01:58:31,916
<b>in its efforts to unearth the truth,</b>

2338
01:58:32,041 --> 01:58:33,958
<b>by procedure sanctioned by law.</b>

2339
01:58:33,958 --> 01:58:35,041
<b>At the same time,</b>

2340
01:58:35,250 --> 01:58:38,250
<b>the discretionary power
vested under Section 311 CrPC</b>

2341
01:58:38,291 --> 01:58:40,166
<b>has to be exercised judicially,</b>

2342
01:58:40,208 --> 01:58:41,666
<b>for strong and valid reasons,</b>

2343
01:58:41,708 --> 01:58:44,750
<b>and with caution and circumspection
to have a just decision of the case.</b>

2344
01:58:45,458 --> 01:58:46,666
<b>What is this new evidence?</b>

2345
01:58:46,791 --> 01:58:47,791
<b>What is the relevance?</b>

2346
01:58:47,916 --> 01:58:49,916
<b>PW7, Driver Robin.</b>

2347
01:58:49,916 --> 01:58:52,083
<b>I've submitted an electronic
evidence to the court,</b>

2348
01:58:52,125 --> 01:58:55,291
<b>to prove the contradictory statements
made by him before the court.</b>

2349
01:58:55,291 --> 01:58:56,833
<b>It cannot be accepted, Your Honour.</b>

2350
01:58:57,125 --> 01:58:59,583
<b>The source of this electronic evidence,
its custodian...</b>

2351
01:58:59,750 --> 01:59:01,750
<b>None of these have
appeared before the court.</b>

2352
01:59:01,875 --> 01:59:03,791
<b>It cannot be accepted as legal evidence.</b>

2353
01:59:04,125 --> 01:59:06,958
<b>Mrs. Counsel, don't you trust
your driver's testimony?</b>

2354
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:08,500
<b>This is not a matter of trust.</b>

2355
01:59:08,791 --> 01:59:09,416
<b>In the court--</b>

2356
01:59:09,458 --> 01:59:12,125
<b>I haven't decided whether this
has to be marked or not. Got it?</b>

2357
01:59:18,041 --> 01:59:19,625
<b>What is this?
Can you explain?</b>

2358
01:59:21,916 --> 01:59:24,250
<b>This is video clip no. 3 of Exhibit D4,</b>

2359
01:59:24,375 --> 01:59:27,625
<b>adduced as evidence
by the defence.</b>

2360
01:59:27,708 --> 01:59:29,291
<b>From its examination,</b>

2361
01:59:29,333 --> 01:59:33,208
<b>it was observed that the accused's car
passed through Nalanchira Junction.</b>

2362
01:59:33,250 --> 01:59:35,750
<b>And these are the visuals
recorded on the dash-cam of this car</b>

2363
01:59:35,750 --> 01:59:38,000
<b>that came from the opposite direction,
at that junction.</b>

2364
01:59:43,041 --> 01:59:45,625
<b>From this visual, it is clear
that on the day of the incident,</b>

2365
01:59:45,666 --> 01:59:47,875
<b>the accused was
not driving the car,</b>

2366
01:59:47,958 --> 01:59:49,416
<b>and it was his driver, Robin.</b>

2367
02:00:09,875 --> 02:00:12,416
<b>How can the court ensure
the credibility of these visuals?</b>

2368
02:00:12,625 --> 02:00:14,416
<b>This incident happened
eight months ago.</b>

2369
02:00:14,833 --> 02:00:17,041
<b>What's before the court now,
is just a pen drive.</b>

2370
02:00:17,208 --> 02:00:19,375
<b>When we enquired
about this car's details,</b>

2371
02:00:19,416 --> 02:00:22,125
<b>we realized that Vijayakumar,
who works in Dubai,</b>

2372
02:00:22,375 --> 02:00:25,791
<b>had bought this car for his own
private use, when he comes to Kerala.</b>

2373
02:00:25,916 --> 02:00:27,875
<b>Since it has been eight
months after the incident,</b>

2374
02:00:27,916 --> 02:00:30,666
<b>we were afraid that these
visuals may have been lost.</b>

2375
02:00:31,166 --> 02:00:34,583
<b>But since it's a car that has made
only a limited number of trips,</b>

2376
02:00:34,583 --> 02:00:36,000
<b>we were able to get the visuals.</b>

2377
02:00:36,291 --> 02:00:38,250
<b>Are you able to produce
the original device?</b>

2378
02:00:38,250 --> 02:00:39,750
<b>It's being produced, Your Honour.</b>

2379
02:00:40,875 --> 02:00:42,833
<b>Any further evidence
from the defence side?</b>

2380
02:00:42,833 --> 02:00:43,833
<b>No, Your Honour.</b>

2381
02:00:44,500 --> 02:00:46,333
<b>So, I can close the defence
evidence, right?</b>

2382
02:00:46,583 --> 02:00:49,583
<b>The Prosecution has obtained
a few public documents.</b>

2383
02:00:57,833 --> 02:01:00,208
<b>Your Honour, this is a...</b>

2384
02:01:00,500 --> 02:01:04,125
<b>certified copy of Mumbai High Court's
single-bench verdict, from April 2016.</b>

2385
02:01:04,500 --> 02:01:09,208
<b>This is an order upon the petition that
was filed to quash an FIR and final report</b>

2386
02:01:09,333 --> 02:01:13,916
<b>registered as Bandra Police
Station Crime No. 492/2016.</b>

2387
02:01:14,208 --> 02:01:15,500
<b>The offence was rape.</b>

2388
02:01:15,833 --> 02:01:17,000
<b>Though an FIR was written,</b>

2389
02:01:17,291 --> 02:01:18,750
<b>they were unable to
arrest the accused.</b>

2390
02:01:18,791 --> 02:01:20,541
<b>When the court examined
the charge-sheet,</b>

2391
02:01:20,583 --> 02:01:22,166
<b>no evidence was found.</b>

2392
02:01:22,833 --> 02:01:25,000
<b>Based on the victim's affidavit,</b>

2393
02:01:25,416 --> 02:01:27,458
<b>the court quashed the final report.</b>

2394
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:31,958
<b>Your Honour, in the documents
submitted before the Honourable Court,</b>

2395
02:01:32,500 --> 02:01:34,208
<b>the person mentioned
as accused in the FIR,</b>

2396
02:01:34,250 --> 02:01:36,541
<b>is 21-year-old Michael Joseph,</b>

2397
02:01:36,583 --> 02:01:38,416
<b>son of Christopher Joseph.</b>

2398
02:01:38,458 --> 02:01:42,166
<b>It's the same accused who's standing
in the accused dock before this court.</b>

2399
02:01:42,416 --> 02:01:45,041
<b>The accused in both cases
are one and the same.</b>

2400
02:01:52,208 --> 02:01:53,208
<b>Dad, what is this?</b>

2401
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:55,375
<b>Nobody told me about this.</b>

2402
02:01:55,583 --> 02:01:57,916
<b>It is evident that the accused
had the history...</b>

2403
02:01:57,916 --> 02:01:59,875
<b>of committing the offence
of same nature.</b>

2404
02:02:02,166 --> 02:02:03,666
<b>All are certified copies.</b>

2405
02:02:04,291 --> 02:02:05,500
<b>They are public documents.</b>

2406
02:02:06,041 --> 02:02:07,041
<b>I can mark them, right?</b>

2407
02:02:07,666 --> 02:02:08,666
<b>Yes, Your Honour.</b>

2408
02:02:09,208 --> 02:02:11,125
<b>No objection in the veracity
of the documents.</b>

2409
02:02:11,708 --> 02:02:12,708
<b>However,</b>

2410
02:02:12,958 --> 02:02:15,208
<b>as long as the court hasn't found
Michael to be guilty,</b>

2411
02:02:15,583 --> 02:02:18,333
<b>in any of the documents
submitted by the Prosecution now,</b>

2412
02:02:18,791 --> 02:02:20,958
<b>we cannot say that the accused
has antecedents.</b>

2413
02:02:21,833 --> 02:02:23,500
<b>Mrs. Counsel has raised a valid point.</b>

2414
02:02:23,833 --> 02:02:24,875
<b>There is no conviction.</b>

2415
02:02:24,916 --> 02:02:28,208
<b>Your Honour, I was pointing out
the modus operandi of the accused.</b>

2416
02:02:28,583 --> 02:02:32,791
<b>Just because the accused was never punished
in the cases he was charged in so far,</b>

2417
02:02:32,833 --> 02:02:35,333
<b>this argument shouldn't be discarded.</b>

2418
02:02:35,916 --> 02:02:38,041
<b>Yes. Defence evidence is closed.</b>

2419
02:02:39,750 --> 02:02:40,791
<b>Posted on...</b>

2420
02:02:41,916 --> 02:02:43,125
<b>Shall I fix it on 21/11?</b>

2421
02:02:44,125 --> 02:02:45,125
<b>Yes.</b>

2422
02:02:46,333 --> 02:02:49,166
<b>Posted on 21.11.2023 for final hearing.</b>

2423
02:02:52,583 --> 02:02:54,583
<b>The way you questioned his friends...</b>

2424
02:02:54,875 --> 02:02:56,458
<b>That was really awesome!</b>

2425
02:02:57,166 --> 02:03:00,041
<b>If they had recreated that day,</b>

2426
02:03:00,166 --> 02:03:01,583
<b>we would have
been in deep trouble.</b>

2427
02:03:07,083 --> 02:03:09,041
<b>So, we will win this case.
Right, sir?</b>

2428
02:03:09,500 --> 02:03:11,458
<b>To be frank, we cannot confirm it yet.</b>

2429
02:03:12,208 --> 02:03:14,083
<b>Their lies have all been exposed, right?</b>

2430
02:03:14,375 --> 02:03:15,958
<b>So, isn't it clear that it is him, sir?</b>

2431
02:03:21,166 --> 02:03:23,708
<b>Well, their main argument
was that he drove his car...</b>

2432
02:03:23,708 --> 02:03:26,125
<b>and went somewhere else,
on the day of the incident, right?</b>

2433
02:03:27,916 --> 02:03:31,083
<b>Sir, it's just that we've destroyed
the possibilities for Michael...</b>

2434
02:03:31,083 --> 02:03:34,125
<b>to be easily acquitted in this case.</b>

2435
02:03:34,750 --> 02:03:37,375
<b>It is yet to be proved in the court
beyond doubt that</b>

2436
02:03:37,375 --> 02:03:39,875
<b>it is indeed Michael
who committed this crime.</b>

2437
02:03:40,791 --> 02:03:42,416
<b>This is such a strange system, sir!</b>

2438
02:03:44,125 --> 02:03:45,666
<b>Even after doing so much...</b>

2439
02:03:46,166 --> 02:03:49,000
<b>Sir, this is not like
an ordinary rape case.</b>

2440
02:03:50,416 --> 02:03:52,041
<b>If we had an eye-witness as well,</b>

2441
02:03:52,041 --> 02:03:53,625
<b>that would have made
our case stronger.</b>

2442
02:03:55,458 --> 02:03:57,666
<b>Unfortunately, Sara is blind.</b>

2443
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:01,833
<b>Even though she sculpted his face,</b>

2444
02:04:03,208 --> 02:04:04,958
<b>it became of no use, sir.</b>

2445
02:04:14,250 --> 02:04:15,875
<b>So, we won't win this case.</b>

2446
02:04:15,916 --> 02:04:16,916
<b>Right, sir?</b>

2447
02:04:19,791 --> 02:04:20,791
<b>As a lawyer,</b>

2448
02:04:21,500 --> 02:04:25,333
<b>it's not right on my part to predict
the success or failure of this case.</b>

2449
02:04:29,083 --> 02:04:30,791
<b>Anyway, during the final hearing,</b>

2450
02:04:30,875 --> 02:04:32,541
<b>I am going to make one last attempt.</b>

2451
02:04:36,875 --> 02:04:38,416
<b>I'll try casting a bait.</b>

2452
02:04:41,500 --> 02:04:43,958
<b>Depends on our luck whether
they would take the bite or not.</b>

2453
02:04:58,625 --> 02:04:59,791
<b>Yes, Mr. Prosecutor!</b>

2454
02:05:00,083 --> 02:05:01,083
<b>What do you have to say?</b>

2455
02:05:13,041 --> 02:05:14,041
<b>Your Honour!</b>

2456
02:05:15,166 --> 02:05:19,041
<b>I don't wish to resort to the approach
of a usual final hearing.</b>

2457
02:05:19,333 --> 02:05:22,250
<b>Instead, I'll present the story
that unravelled before this court...</b>

2458
02:05:22,458 --> 02:05:23,583
<b>during this trial.</b>

2459
02:05:23,750 --> 02:05:25,125
<b>It's a story of courage,</b>

2460
02:05:25,375 --> 02:05:26,375
<b>resilience,</b>

2461
02:05:26,708 --> 02:05:27,833
<b>and justice.</b>

2462
02:05:29,166 --> 02:05:31,416
<b>A young man, comes to this city,</b>

2463
02:05:31,458 --> 02:05:34,125
<b>searching for his friend's house,
to invite him for his wedding.</b>

2464
02:05:34,750 --> 02:05:37,708
<b>To inquire the route
to that friend's place,</b>

2465
02:05:37,958 --> 02:05:39,416
<b>he enters the premises of a house.</b>

2466
02:05:40,833 --> 02:05:44,083
<b>There, he sees a blind girl.</b>

2467
02:05:45,250 --> 02:05:48,791
<b>He is drawn with desire
to that beautiful girl.</b>

2468
02:05:50,375 --> 02:05:53,291
<b>Upon hearing the information
that the girl will be alone at her house</b>

2469
02:05:53,291 --> 02:05:54,875
<b>on the next day,</b>

2470
02:05:55,208 --> 02:05:58,916
<b>he immediately decides to stay back
at his friend's place on that day.</b>

2471
02:06:01,125 --> 02:06:02,416
<b>The same night,</b>

2472
02:06:02,541 --> 02:06:04,333
<b>he calls up his company driver,</b>

2473
02:06:04,458 --> 02:06:07,000
<b>and asks him to reach there
by 6:00 a.m. next morning,</b>

2474
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:08,541
<b>with another car.</b>

2475
02:06:09,541 --> 02:06:13,000
<b>Once his friend and his family
left to the church in the morning,</b>

2476
02:06:13,375 --> 02:06:15,125
<b>he asks the driver to come inside.</b>

2477
02:06:15,416 --> 02:06:18,541
<b>After that, he hands over his phone
and car to the driver,</b>

2478
02:06:18,958 --> 02:06:22,625
<b>and instructs him to go
to a resort in Kanthalloor.</b>

2479
02:06:24,583 --> 02:06:27,583
<b>Until that girl's father, mother
and their domestic help...</b>

2480
02:06:27,916 --> 02:06:29,375
<b>went out of the house,</b>

2481
02:06:29,416 --> 02:06:31,583
<b>he waited near their house.</b>

2482
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,458
<b>After confirming that
everyone else had left,</b>

2483
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,166
<b>he enters through the backside
of the house,</b>

2484
02:06:37,375 --> 02:06:39,416
<b>and climbs on to the terrace.</b>

2485
02:06:47,041 --> 02:06:51,625
<b>He enters the house through
the terrace door that was lying open,</b>

2486
02:06:51,958 --> 02:06:54,833
<b>and then walks into that girl's room.</b>

2487
02:07:25,375 --> 02:07:28,000
<b>That young man, who had
been hiding in that room,</b>

2488
02:07:28,375 --> 02:07:31,125
<b>assaults the girl who had just come out
after finishing her bath,</b>

2489
02:07:31,458 --> 02:07:33,375
<b>threatens to kill her,</b>

2490
02:07:33,666 --> 02:07:35,083
<b>and rapes her.</b>

2491
02:07:36,375 --> 02:07:38,666
<b>If you make noise,
I'll slit your throat.</b>

2492
02:07:40,208 --> 02:07:45,833
<b>That helpless girl who was unable to even
decipher what was happening to her,</b>

2493
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:47,708
<b>regains her composure
and presence of mind,</b>

2494
02:07:47,708 --> 02:07:52,916
<b>uses her skill to comprehend anything
and everything through touch,</b>

2495
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,041
<b>and identifies that young man.</b>

2496
02:07:55,500 --> 02:08:00,625
<b>That blind girl shows that young man's
face that was imprinted in her mind,</b>

2497
02:08:00,625 --> 02:08:03,375
<b>to the world, through a sculpture.</b>

2498
02:08:03,541 --> 02:08:05,708
<b>The young man is arrested by the police,
using that evidence.</b>

2499
02:08:05,958 --> 02:08:08,083
<b>The young man in this story....</b>

2500
02:08:08,333 --> 02:08:11,041
<b>is the one standing in the dock
of the Honourable Court,</b>

2501
02:08:11,166 --> 02:08:12,166
<b>Michael!</b>

2502
02:08:12,250 --> 02:08:13,583
<b>Up next are the evidences.</b>

2503
02:08:13,625 --> 02:08:15,500
<b>The chemical substance of the condom....</b>

2504
02:08:15,583 --> 02:08:17,458
<b>that was found from Michael's wallet;</b>

2505
02:08:17,750 --> 02:08:20,500
<b>The witness testimonies proving
the presence of Michael at the spot,</b>

2506
02:08:20,541 --> 02:08:23,166
<b>on the day of the incident
and the previous day;</b>

2507
02:08:23,333 --> 02:08:24,750
<b>And evidence to prove</b>

2508
02:08:24,791 --> 02:08:27,666
<b>that Michael was involved
in similar crimes, earlier as well.</b>

2509
02:08:27,916 --> 02:08:31,041
<b>The girl who showcased the accused's face
through a sculpture,</b>

2510
02:08:31,166 --> 02:08:33,416
<b>recognized the accused
through his voice and by touch,</b>

2511
02:08:33,458 --> 02:08:35,541
<b>during the identification parade.</b>

2512
02:08:36,208 --> 02:08:38,458
<b>The undeniable truth is that...</b>

2513
02:08:38,458 --> 02:08:40,958
<b>the accused's efforts to escape
the grasp of the law</b>

2514
02:08:41,166 --> 02:08:43,833
<b>by leveraging the benefit of doubt,
have proven to be in vain.</b>

2515
02:08:44,166 --> 02:08:45,833
<b>So, it's a clear case of conviction,</b>

2516
02:08:45,875 --> 02:08:47,750
<b>proved beyond reasonable doubt.</b>

2517
02:08:48,416 --> 02:08:50,333
<b>If the accused is not punished,</b>

2518
02:08:50,375 --> 02:08:54,166
<b>it would be akin to insulting this
blind girl who overcame her limitations...</b>

2519
02:08:54,458 --> 02:08:56,083
<b>by transforming her hands
into her eyes;</b>

2520
02:08:56,458 --> 02:09:01,291
<b>the courage she showed to expose the
accused to the world through a sculpture;</b>

2521
02:09:01,416 --> 02:09:04,583
<b>and her survival.</b>

2522
02:09:05,666 --> 02:09:08,166
<b>Hence, this Honourable Court
may kindly give,</b>

2523
02:09:08,166 --> 02:09:09,416
<b>maximum punishment...</b>

2524
02:09:09,625 --> 02:09:12,041
<b>envisaged in the Indian Penal Code,</b>

2525
02:09:12,333 --> 02:09:13,583
<b>to this accused.</b>

2526
02:09:19,583 --> 02:09:20,583
<b>The story is really nice!</b>

2527
02:09:20,875 --> 02:09:22,416
<b>The visuals are even more outstanding.</b>

2528
02:09:22,416 --> 02:09:23,916
<b>If it's a movie,
it will work wonders.</b>

2529
02:09:23,958 --> 02:09:25,125
<b>But, this is a court, right?</b>

2530
02:09:25,291 --> 02:09:26,791
<b>Here, it's the evidence that matters.</b>

2531
02:09:28,625 --> 02:09:29,666
<b>Your Honour!</b>

2532
02:09:29,666 --> 02:09:32,375
<b>Verdict of guilt must be based
on the evidence...</b>

2533
02:09:32,416 --> 02:09:34,416
<b>that leaves no room
for the reasonable doubt.</b>

2534
02:09:34,541 --> 02:09:35,541
<b>In this case,</b>

2535
02:09:35,583 --> 02:09:37,416
<b>plea of alibi may have
been challenged.</b>

2536
02:09:38,166 --> 02:09:39,291
<b>Is it beyond doubt?</b>

2537
02:09:40,791 --> 02:09:42,375
<b>Then, as the Prosecutor said,</b>

2538
02:09:42,750 --> 02:09:45,333
<b>the case is not being conducted
to just use the benefit of doubt,</b>

2539
02:09:45,333 --> 02:09:47,958
<b>but to declare him as innocent.</b>

2540
02:09:48,666 --> 02:09:49,708
<b>Your Honour,</b>

2541
02:09:49,750 --> 02:09:52,958
<b>there are absolutely no materials
produced before this Honourable Court,</b>

2542
02:09:53,041 --> 02:09:55,125
<b>that connect this accused
with the present crime.</b>

2543
02:09:55,625 --> 02:09:58,833
<b>There are no medical and scientific
evidence against the accused.</b>

2544
02:09:59,458 --> 02:10:01,250
<b>The tower locations of the accused,</b>

2545
02:10:01,333 --> 02:10:03,041
<b>and the witness testimonies</b>

2546
02:10:03,041 --> 02:10:05,375
<b>are all proving that the accused
was not present at the crime spot,</b>

2547
02:10:05,416 --> 02:10:06,541
<b>on the day of the incident,</b>

2548
02:10:06,583 --> 02:10:09,083
<b>at the time when the incident
reportedly occurred.</b>

2549
02:10:09,500 --> 02:10:12,500
<b>And one eye-witness who can state
that this incident actually occurred...</b>

2550
02:10:12,916 --> 02:10:14,125
<b>That is also absent here.</b>

2551
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:16,250
<b>The victim is blind.</b>

2552
02:10:17,208 --> 02:10:18,958
<b>Let the Lord have mercy on the victim!</b>

2553
02:10:19,916 --> 02:10:22,041
<b>Your Honour, the court
cannot convict a person,</b>

2554
02:10:22,041 --> 02:10:23,708
<b>based on assumptions
and presumptions.</b>

2555
02:10:23,916 --> 02:10:25,833
<b>It should be based
on concrete evidence,</b>

2556
02:10:25,958 --> 02:10:27,791
<b>and that evidence
is also lacking here.</b>

2557
02:10:28,416 --> 02:10:31,875
<b>Just because a blind girl said
that someone assaulted her,</b>

2558
02:10:31,916 --> 02:10:33,500
<b>an FIR was registered,</b>

2559
02:10:33,500 --> 02:10:36,125
<b>and the very next day,
a random sculpture was produced,</b>

2560
02:10:36,125 --> 02:10:39,166
<b>to arrest this young man
and have him on this dock now.</b>

2561
02:10:39,458 --> 02:10:42,041
<b>It's evident that PW 2 Mohammed,
the victim's step-father,</b>

2562
02:10:42,250 --> 02:10:44,208
<b>is a skilled sculpture artist,</b>

2563
02:10:44,500 --> 02:10:45,958
<b>from his own testimony.</b>

2564
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:47,833
<b>We must consider
the possibilities that...</b>

2565
02:10:47,833 --> 02:10:50,208
<b>Mohammed could have created
the sculpture on his own...</b>

2566
02:10:50,208 --> 02:10:51,541
<b>and presented it to the Police.</b>

2567
02:10:51,875 --> 02:10:52,875
<b>Furthermore,</b>

2568
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:54,833
<b>there are no evidences
adduced till date,</b>

2569
02:10:55,125 --> 02:10:58,375
<b>which can prove
that this blind victim....</b>

2570
02:10:58,541 --> 02:11:01,291
<b>is a sculpture artist.</b>

2571
02:11:01,583 --> 02:11:03,458
<b>She is a skilled sculpture artist.</b>

2572
02:11:05,041 --> 02:11:06,750
<b>As my learned colleague pointed out,</b>

2573
02:11:07,125 --> 02:11:09,166
<b>if this victim claims
to be a skilled dancer,</b>

2574
02:11:09,458 --> 02:11:10,958
<b>would you all believe
it without any proof?</b>

2575
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,250
<b>No! You can see it for yourself
whether it's true or not.</b>

2576
02:11:13,291 --> 02:11:14,750
<b>Prosecutor, what do you mean?</b>

2577
02:11:14,916 --> 02:11:16,625
<b>The Honourable Court may kindly...</b>

2578
02:11:16,708 --> 02:11:18,958
<b>give a fair chance
to demonstrate her skill.</b>

2579
02:11:21,833 --> 02:11:23,833
<b>It's simply an effort to waste
the court's time.</b>

2580
02:11:23,958 --> 02:11:26,041
<b>Even if she makes
a sculpture or not,</b>

2581
02:11:26,083 --> 02:11:28,208
<b>that cannot be adduced as
evidence before this Court.</b>

2582
02:11:28,208 --> 02:11:29,750
<b>Why? What happened?</b>

2583
02:11:30,375 --> 02:11:32,041
<b>Mrs. Poornima, are you doubtful now,</b>

2584
02:11:32,041 --> 02:11:33,958
<b>that she could be a
skilled sculpture artist?</b>

2585
02:11:34,333 --> 02:11:35,666
<b>That's not the case, Your Honour!</b>

2586
02:11:35,666 --> 02:11:38,583
<b>After the trial has been completed,
and as the final hearing nears its end,</b>

2587
02:11:38,583 --> 02:11:41,541
<b>he has come up with a procedure
called demonstration, which is unheard of.</b>

2588
02:11:41,583 --> 02:11:43,750
<b>From time to time,
to substantiate the truth,</b>

2589
02:11:43,791 --> 02:11:46,375
<b>many of the decisions taken
by the courts in this country,</b>

2590
02:11:46,416 --> 02:11:47,666
<b>have become part of history.</b>

2591
02:11:48,541 --> 02:11:50,708
<b>To grant justice to a helpless girl,</b>

2592
02:11:50,708 --> 02:11:53,041
<b>who has been a victim of a brutal rape;</b>

2593
02:11:53,250 --> 02:11:56,875
<b>what's wrong if this Honourable Court
decides to create history?</b>

2594
02:11:57,250 --> 02:11:59,125
<b>Your Honour may lay down the law!</b>

2595
02:12:05,625 --> 02:12:07,125
<b>May be it is unprecedented.</b>

2596
02:12:08,916 --> 02:12:10,375
<b>But I feel it is essential.</b>

2597
02:12:12,708 --> 02:12:15,416
<b>But, before that, we need to know
if the victim is ready for it.</b>

2598
02:12:22,375 --> 02:12:25,458
<b>Extraordinary moments are
unfolding before the Court now.</b>

2599
02:12:25,458 --> 02:12:28,416
<b>As the final hearing was coming to a close
after the completion of the trial,</b>

2600
02:12:28,458 --> 02:12:30,291
<b>the Prosecution has made
an unexpected move.</b>

2601
02:12:44,875 --> 02:12:47,333
<b>Mr. Vijayamohan, how do you propose
to demonstrate it?</b>

2602
02:12:48,291 --> 02:12:50,666
<b>We will select a person
who is presently in this courtroom.</b>

2603
02:12:50,875 --> 02:12:53,333
<b>Then, that girl will touch
that person's face to assess it,</b>

2604
02:12:53,625 --> 02:12:55,208
<b>and make a sculpture of that face.</b>

2605
02:12:56,291 --> 02:12:57,666
<b>A humble submission, Your Honour!</b>

2606
02:12:57,708 --> 02:13:00,500
<b>- Yes!
- Please allow us to select that person.</b>

2607
02:13:04,291 --> 02:13:05,333
<b>I think it's fair.</b>

2608
02:13:06,250 --> 02:13:07,541
<b>Yes! You can choose.</b>

2609
02:13:07,958 --> 02:13:09,708
<b>This should be conducted
in an atmosphere</b>

2610
02:13:09,750 --> 02:13:11,916
<b>similar to the one where the
crime reportedly happened.</b>

2611
02:13:11,958 --> 02:13:13,416
<b>I mean, she should be alone.</b>

2612
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:17,166
<b>Also, to touch and assess the person,
a time frame should be fixed.</b>

2613
02:13:17,583 --> 02:13:18,583
<b>Like, five minutes?</b>

2614
02:13:22,083 --> 02:13:23,083
<b>Okay!</b>

2615
02:13:23,291 --> 02:13:24,875
<b>In the incident that
stunned the State,</b>

2616
02:13:24,875 --> 02:13:27,916
<b>there emerged reports that the sculpture
found by the investigating officers</b>

2617
02:13:27,916 --> 02:13:29,541
<b>was actually created by the victim.</b>

2618
02:13:29,541 --> 02:13:33,791
<b>This sculpture led the police to deduce
that Michael is the main suspect.</b>

2619
02:13:33,791 --> 02:13:36,250
<b>But at this moment,
as the trial is almost complete,</b>

2620
02:13:36,458 --> 02:13:40,375
<b>why has the court asked
the girl to make a sculpture?</b>

2621
02:13:40,416 --> 02:13:42,083
<b>That's the question
which has emerged now.</b>

2622
02:13:42,125 --> 02:13:44,083
<b>The court premises
have become the stage...</b>

2623
02:13:44,083 --> 02:13:46,375
<b>for exceptionally dramatic
moments, at present.</b>

2624
02:14:06,291 --> 02:14:07,291
<b>Can I?</b>

2625
02:14:09,250 --> 02:14:10,250
<b>Yeah!</b>

2626
02:14:20,791 --> 02:14:22,166
<b>Could you please stop moving?</b>

2627
02:14:23,041 --> 02:14:24,041
<b>Of course!</b>

2628
02:14:24,125 --> 02:14:26,125
<b>I shall do everything as you say, Sara.</b>

2629
02:14:27,541 --> 02:14:28,708
<b>After all,</b>

2630
02:14:28,833 --> 02:14:30,750
<b>it is to save my client, right?</b>

2631
02:14:31,083 --> 02:14:32,250
<b>I shall stay put.</b>

2632
02:14:34,083 --> 02:14:35,083
<b>Touch me!</b>

2633
02:14:36,083 --> 02:14:37,458
<b>Touch me wherever you want to!</b>

2634
02:14:44,541 --> 02:14:45,583
<b>Sara!</b>

2635
02:14:46,375 --> 02:14:48,750
<b>Just like your other sensory organs....</b>

2636
02:14:48,875 --> 02:14:50,333
<b>is this also really sharp?</b>

2637
02:14:50,541 --> 02:14:51,708
<b>I mean, your sense of touch?</b>

2638
02:14:54,375 --> 02:14:55,375
<b>Tell me, Sara!</b>

2639
02:14:58,041 --> 02:14:59,416
<b>Sir! Please let me do this now.</b>

2640
02:15:00,291 --> 02:15:01,541
<b>Please let me focus!</b>

2641
02:15:02,208 --> 02:15:03,208
<b>Well!</b>

2642
02:15:04,041 --> 02:15:05,708
<b>Fathered by some random man,</b>

2643
02:15:05,833 --> 02:15:07,666
<b>and addressing someone else
as your father,</b>

2644
02:15:07,666 --> 02:15:09,750
<b>you've been leading a
terrible life as a blind girl,</b>

2645

<b>and some random guy

2646
02:15:12,291 --> 02:15:14,375
<b>What's the point in having

<b>It's a cursed life, isn't it?</b>

2649
02:15:23,583 --> 02:15:25,666
<b>Sara, do you remember that day?</b>

2650
02:15:26,583 --> 02:15:29,541
<b>Running your fingers

<b>Try to recollect it.</b>

02:15:35,208 --> 02:15:36,250
<b>How was it?</b>

2653
02:15:37,666 --> 02:15:38,666
<b>Did you enjoy?</b>

2654
02:15:40,416 --> 02:15:41,791
<b>Was it your first time?</b>

2655
02:15:43,833 --> 02:15:44,833
<b>No!</b>

2656
02:15:45,791 --> 02:15:47,041
<b>I don't think so.</b>

2657
02:15:48,291 --> 02:15:50,416
<b>It wasn't your first time, Sara!</b>

2658
02:15:51,041 --> 02:15:52,041
<b>Right?</b>

2659
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,458
<b>This is quite strange and unbelievable!</b>

2660
02:16:01,666 --> 02:16:03,375
<b>When you were being raped,</b>

2661
02:16:03,416 --> 02:16:05,041

2662
02:16:05,041 --> 02:16:07,041
<b>so as to run your fingers
through his face,</b>

2663
02:16:07,041 --> 02:16:09,125
<b>and identifying him thereby.</b>

2664
02:16:12,375 --> 02:16:13,958
<b>This is not a rape.</b>

2665
02:16:14,375 --> 02:16:16,291
<b>This is... consensual!</b>

2666
02:16:17,125 --> 02:16:18,500
<b>You wished for it,</b>

2667
02:16:18,583 --> 02:16:20,791
<b>and it has happened
with your consent.</b>

2668
02:16:21,833 --> 02:16:22,875
<b>Isn't it, Sara?</b>

2669
02:16:23,541 --> 02:16:24,750
<b>Please show some decency, sir.</b>

2670
02:16:25,666 --> 02:16:26,875
<b>Decency?</b>

2671
02:16:27,750 --> 02:16:30,500
<b>While seducing a random stranger,</b>

2672
02:16:30,583 --> 02:16:33,083
<b>and thereby orphaning
his wife and children,</b>

2673

<b>Whatever you've done so far
is not at all surprising.</b>

2675

<b>The latest update is that

<b>What do you have to say?</b>

<b>Your Honour! Rape of this nature,</b>

<b>is an atrocity on the human society,</b>

2707
02:22:05,500 --> 02:22:07,708
<b>and not against that given individual.</b>

2708
02:22:08,375 --> 02:22:11,375
<b>To deliver justice to helpless victims,</b>

2709
02:22:11,541 --> 02:22:13,708
<b>and to prevent the occurrence
of more such victims,</b>

2710
02:22:13,791 --> 02:22:15,875
<b>it is imperative that the
accused be sentenced to...</b>

<b>the maximum punishment

<b>Your Prosecutor is seeking a life term

<b>The accused has no antecedent,</b>
