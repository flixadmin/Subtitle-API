1
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,790
Honey mustard.

2
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,500
Honest to God,

3
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,500
it's starting to drive me crazy.

4
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,030
- Don't.

5
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,030
- It keeps me awake.

6
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,990
I lay there thinking, "Where is it?

7
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,990
Where did it go?"

8
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,190
- And I just-- I can't even-- I have no idea.

9
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,190
- Jesse, look.

10
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,920
Doesn't it make sense

11
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,920
that it wound up in the lab?

12
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,070
I thought about that a lot.

13
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,070
But I just don't see how.

14
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,670
Well, look. You had the pack

15
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,670
in your pocket of yourjacket, right?

16
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,310
- Yeah.

17
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,310
- And yourjacket was in your locker.

18
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,750
So maybe the cigarette

19
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,750
fell out of the pocket...

20
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,270
... and wound up in the locker,

21
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,270
and now it's all burned up.

22
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,430
- It's gone.

23
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,430
- Yeah.

24
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,390
But I don't know that, you know?

25
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,710
I can't ever know for sure.

26
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,230
Well, look, did you check your house?

27
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,830
Did you--? Maybe it's

28
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,830
somewhere in your house.

29
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,390
No, man.

30
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,390
I've looked everywhere, okay?

31
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,350
- Your car? Did you check your car?

32
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,350
- No.

33
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,080
- Thoroughly?

34
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,080
- Yes, of course. It's not in my house.

35
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,740
It's not in my car.

36
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,740
The more I think about it...

37
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,030
...there's no way it fell out in my locker.

38
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,190
Somebody's gonna find it

39
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,190
on the street.

40
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,080
- You don't know that.

41
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,080
- Somewhere where I dropped it.

42
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,430
Some innocent person,

43
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,430
some kid maybe, even.

44
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,710
They're gonna pick it up,

45
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,710
and it's gonna--

46
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,350
- You're working yourself all up.

47
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,350
- Oh, my God!

48
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,830
You've gotta get ahold of yourself, here.

49
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,670
All right? I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

50
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,670
I'm gonna come over there.

51
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,830
And together, we're gonna look

52
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,830
for this thing. All right?

53
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,030
Yeah.

54
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,550
What the hell is that?

55
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,750
My Roomba.

56
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,150
I already checked it.

57
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,550
When?

58
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,670
Like a week ago.

59
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,710
Oh, God.

60
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,830
Oh, Jesus.

61
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,630
Okay. Easy, easy. Take it--

62
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,510
Careful. Let me see.

63
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,830
Is it still intact?

64
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,110
Yeah. Good.

65
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,030
Good. No worries.

66
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,310
Let me get rid of this.

67
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,360
What luck.

68
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,080
Well, I don't know about you...

69
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,800
...but I, for one, could use a beer.

70
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,830
You have any?

71
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,310
Jesse?

72
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,310
I almost shot you.

73
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,790
Hey, hey, now....

74
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,030
I almost killed you all because....

75
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,070
Listen.

76
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,630
It was just a misunderstanding,

77
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,630
that's all.

78
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,870
No. No, no, no, no.

79
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:48,190
I don't know what's wrong

80
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:48,190
with me, Mr. White. I--

81
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,550
Hey.

82
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,870
- I don't know how I could be so stupid.

83
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,870
- Stop that now. Come on.

84
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,990
Come on. Come on.

85
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,390
I'm so sorry.

86
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,870
It's okay. It's okay.

87
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,470
Listen to me.

88
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,790
What happened, happened for the best,

89
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,790
you hear me?

90
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,150
And I wouldn't change a thing.

91
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,110
You and I working together...

92
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,670
...having each other's back.

93
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,390
It's what saved our lives.

94
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,790
I....

95
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,310
I want you to think about that

96
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,310
as we go forward.

97
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,110
Go forward where?

98
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,300
Stillwell, steady as you go.

99
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,950
Willie, note the time.

100
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,230
Captain, I'm sorry,

101
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,230
but you're a sick man.

102
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,590
I'm relieving you as captain of the ship

103
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,590
under article 184.

104
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,400
- Oh, God.

105
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,400
- I don't know what you're talking about.

106
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,870
Helmsman, left 180.

107
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,430
Mr. Keith, what do I do?

108
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,430
You're the officer on the deck.

109
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,320
I told you to come left.

110
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,320
Now come left, and fast.

111
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,950
I'm sorry, sir, but you're not issuing

112
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,950
orders on this bridge anymore.

113
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,230
I've relieved you.

114
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,910
I take full responsibil--

115
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,750
Thanks for seeing us.

116
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,150
We're here to talk partnership.

117
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,160
Partnership?

118
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,910
Yes. Equal. Three ways.

119
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,390
You, Jesse and me.

120
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,350
Partnership in what?

121
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,910
Well, we figure we're gonna start

122
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,910
cooking again.

123
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,990
You know, we figure, why not?

124
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,110
There's no denying the popularity

125
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,110
of our product.

126
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,190
There's a market to be filled...

127
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,230
...and currently no one to fill it.

128
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,950
A lot of money to be made.

129
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,710
And obviously, Jesse and I

130
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,710
have manufacture covered.

131
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,990
But there's still distribution...

132
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,110
...support, logistics, that sort of thing.

133
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,750
For instance, we'll need a steady supply

134
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,750
of precursor.

135
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,310
With your experience

136
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,310
and connections...

137
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,150
...you would be a great help.

138
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,070
Granted, there's a lot of work ahead.

139
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,790
There's a lot of rebuilding.

140
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,870
And, no doubt,

141
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,870
our profits will be smaller.

142
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,870
At least at first. But each of us

143
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,870
will receive a larger cut.

144
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,310
Owners, not employees.

145
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,550
Thanks, but no, thanks.

146
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,030
Mike, I know you don't care for me.

147
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,870
We've had our issues, you and I.

148
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,510
But I would suggest...

149
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,180
...that you leave emotion

150
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,180
out of this decision.

151
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,910
I am.

152
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,190
You...

153
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,470
...are trouble.

154
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,950
I'm sorry the kid here doesn't see it,

155
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,950
but I sure as hell do.

156
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,710
You are a time bomb...

157
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,710
...tick, tick, ticking...

158
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:16,830
...and I have no intention

159
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:16,830
of being around for the boom.

160
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,430
Well, sleep on it.

161
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,750
Maybe you'll reconsider.

162
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,470
In the meantime, we're pressing on.

163
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,310
Morning.

164
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,230
Hey, why aren't you upstairs?

165
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,510
- I came to see if you needed any help.

166
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,510
- Yeah, well, I don't.

167
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,990
Well, I can see that, man.

168
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,990
It's outstanding.

169
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,710
Yeah. I'm working on it, here.

170
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,950
Not exactly running marathons,

171
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,950
you know.

172
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,590
Yeah, well, when did your couch-shaped

173
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,590
ass ever run any marathons?

174
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,670
- I'm proud of you, brother.

175
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,670
- Yeah.

176
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,270
So how many Krauts we got?

177
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,950
Enough to invade Poland.

178
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,150
Came in their own G5,

179
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,150
just like Oprah has.

180
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,230
G5, yeah?

181
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,790
Is that one where the wings

182
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,790
go up like that?

183
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,470
- I think they all do that.

184
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,470
- They all have that?

185
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,070
Anyway, we got two U.S. Attorneys

186
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,070
in the house.

187
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,310
Big doings.

188
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,310
Your name keeps coming up.

189
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,630
Yeah? Hey, give me a hand here,

190
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,630
would you?

191
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,710
Just a little bit there. Thanks.

192
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,660
I hired Peter Schuler in 1992.

193
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,910
Almost single-handedly,

194
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,910
he grew our little restaurant division...

195
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,190
...into an industry leader...

196
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,270
...and a source

197
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,270
of great personal pride.

198
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,560
I am shocked and saddened

199
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,560
by his death...

200
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,590
...and outraged by the damage...

201
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:01,470
...his actions have wrought

202
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:01,470
upon my grandfather's company.

203
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,350
Alleged actions.

204
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,590
An innocent man does not kill himself.

205
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,220
My people and I are here to help.

206
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:16,790
To your investigation, I pledge Madrigal's

207
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:16,790
full cooperation and transparency.

208
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,980
I confess I have my selfish reasons.

209
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,190
I believe Peter Schuler

210
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,190
was a lone anomaly.

211
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,240
But if that is not the case,

212
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,240
I want to know it...

213
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,470
...just as you do.

214
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,390
So when you gonna announce it?

215
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,390
I don't know.

216
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,670
As I'm walking out the door

217
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,670
with my big cardboard box.

218
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,350
Can't do that. You know damn well

219
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,350
we're gonna throw you a big party.

220
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,150
Damn straight.

221
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,150
We're talking a blowout.

222
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,880
Outstanding police work, Hank.

223
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,670
If only I'd listened.

224
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,390
But I guess the damage was done.

225
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,070
It's not right,

226
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,070
them putting this on you.

227
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,630
Somebody's gotta go under the bus.

228
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,630
Ramey's a good man.

229
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,790
He'll do right by you.

230
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,670
Besides, this office

231
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,670
practically runs itself.

232
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,790
Bullshit, it does.

233
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,190
Sir.

234
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,950
What's with that A.P.D. thing?

235
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,950
The electromagnets?

236
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,070
They're thinking

237
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,070
it's about Fring's laptop.

238
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,670
A couple of days before it happened,

239
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,670
desk sergeant gets a call...

240
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,990
...from a "postal inspector"

241
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,990
quote, unquote...

242
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,230
...wanting to know

243
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,230
where they keep the thing.

244
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,350
And he told them? Jesus.

245
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,310
Anything left of the laptop?

246
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,950
Do we look that lucky?

247
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,510
I sneaked a peek before A.P.D.

248
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,510
took it out of Fring's office.

249
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:57,150
The whole thing was encrypted. They

250
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:57,150
wouldn't have got anything anyway, but....

251
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,630
So Hector Salamanca killed Fring.

252
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,710
But who gave Salamanca

253
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,710
the bomb?

254
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,470
Whole lot of questions

255
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,470
and not much in the way of answers.

256
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,910
Yet.

257
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,070
The A.P.D. did find

258
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,070
some of Fring's financials.

259
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,740
That just might lead to something.

260
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,190
I had him out to my house.

261
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,390
Fourth of July.

262
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,630
We cooked out in the backyard.

263
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,950
My son shucked the corn.

264
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,950
My daughter cut up potatoes.

265
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,910
Fring brought sea bass.

266
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:41,150
Every time I grill it now, I make

267
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:41,150
a little foil pouch, just like he showed me.

268
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,910
That whole night, we were laughing...

269
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,310
...telling stories, drinking wine.

270
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,670
And he's somebody else completely.

271
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,380
Right in front of me.

272
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,640
Right under my nose.

273
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,390
Hi. What can I get you?

274
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,830
- Just tea. Chamomile.

275
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,830
- Oh, sorry. We don't have chamomile tea.

276
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,510
Then some sort of bergamot,

277
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,510
not Earl Grey.

278
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,550
I like soy milk instead of dairy.

279
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,030
We don't have soy milk

280
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,030
or any sort of bergamot.

281
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,710
You're really running me

282
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,710
through my paces here.

283
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,190
Well, English breakfast, I guess.

284
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,790
We have Lipton's.

285
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,720
That's pretty much all we have.

286
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,400
I would like a cup of hot water, filtered,

287
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,400
if possible, and a slice of lemon.

288
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,470
I'm assuming

289
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,470
you don't have stevia?

290
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,950
Never mind. I brought my own.

291
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,880
You coming to me,

292
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,880
or am I coming to you?

293
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,830
Face forward. We'll talk like this.

294
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,390
I guess I'm coming to you.

295
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,790
Take a breath, will you?

296
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,870
This place is safe.

297
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,870
No one's gonna see you here.

298
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,750
My God. Duane, this is so-- Thank you.

299
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,990
How did I not see you sitting back there?

300
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,990
So weird.

301
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,430
You want anything else, Mike?

302
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,550
No. I'm good, Fran. Thanks.

303
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,550
Now...

304
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,660
...how about

305
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,660
we lose the sunglasses?

306
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,830
I feel like I'm talking

307
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,830
to Jackie Onassis here.

308
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,670
There you go.

309
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,710
Breathe in, breathe out.

310
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,790
Drink your whatever.

311
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,390
Who killed Gus?

312
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,200
Haven't I told you

313
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,200
not to worry about that?

314
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,310
Now, what do you want from me,

315
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,310
and why is it so important?

316
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,950
What's this?

317
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,600
A list of 11 names.

318
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,350
Okay.

319
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,550
You know them all.

320
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,960
I do.

321
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,430
Those 11 men--

322
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,430
And I think you know this, Mike.

323
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,990
Those 11 could sink us,

324
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,990
you and me both.

325
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,990
- Where are we going with this?

326
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,990
- No specific.... I'm just pointing out facts.

327
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,230
These men--

328
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,230
Your men, yours and Gus'...

329
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,710
...they were on the payroll,

330
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,710
very publicly.

331
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,590
They trace back to Pollos, the laundry,

332
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,590
to Madrigal.

333
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,440
They're gonna get picked up

334
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,440
by the police. When they do...

335
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,110
...and threatened,

336
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,110
and there's only one way out--

337
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,950
And I'm not saying all of them, okay?

338
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,350
All it's gonna take is two or three,

339
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,350
or even one.

340
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,020
But there's always a weak link.

341
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,020
But they're gonna talk.

342
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,160
At least one's gonna talk about you,

343
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,160
me, and that's all it's gonna take.

344
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,230
These are the 11 I know of,

345
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,230
but I'd love your input.

346
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,630
I never met your chemist, for instance.

347
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,520
I'd love your input.

348
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:38,150
You want me to kill

349
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:38,150
every man on that list?

350
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,590
That's a leap, what you just....

351
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,310
No, I didn't say that.

352
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:50,270
But if you think that'd be wise....

353
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,280
You're scared, aren't you?

354
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,190
Yeah.

355
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,070
You're very upset, which I'm gonna factor

356
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,070
into my response here.

357
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,510
These are my guys,

358
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,510
and they are solid.

359
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,030
- Understand?

360
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,030
- What about Chow at the warehouse?

361
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,350
Didn't you have to shoot him

362
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,350
through the hand?

363
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,400
- Think that didn't stick in his memory?

364
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,400
- What about Dennis at the laundry?

365
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,790
- They're sure to pick him up.

366
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,790
- They already have.

367
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,950
They picked him up last night.

368
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,870
My guys are solid.

369
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,110
I vetted them with great care...

370
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,110
...and Fring made sure

371
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,110
they were well compensated...

372
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:32,630
...in the event of a situation such as this.

373
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:32,630
They're paid to stand up to the heat...

374
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,430
...keep their mouths shut,

375
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,430
no matter what.

376
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,270
And they will.

377
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,300
I don't know what movies

378
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,300
you've been watching...

379
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,240
...but in the real world,

380
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,240
we don't kill 1 1 people...

381
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,030
...as some kind of

382
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,030
prophylactic measure.

383
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,870
Look at me...

384
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,310
...and say you understand.

385
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,950
I understand.

386
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,350
- I get it.

387
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,350
- So we're off that very silly idea?

388
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,800
Good.

389
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,710
Drink your hot water.

390
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,630
I gotta go.

391
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,350
Did you have enough?

392
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,070
Yeah. I'm good.

393
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,500
Okay.

394
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,870
Bye-bye.

395
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,110
- Bye.

396
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,110
- Bye.

397
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,230
Bye, big brother.

398
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,950
Say bye to Mom for me.

399
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,630
I will. Have a good day.

400
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,790
You too.

401
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,830
Skyler.

402
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,230
Hey.

403
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,230
The car wash opens in 15 minutes.

404
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,470
Mariano can open for me today.

405
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,870
Hey, how about you get up, huh?

406
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,870
Come on.

407
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,220
A shower will feel good.

408
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,670
Hey, Chow.

409
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,270
How you holding up?

410
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,150
Okay.

411
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,990
You know, they....

412
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,270
They talked to me.

413
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,870
You can't smoke in here, Chow.

414
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,420
Thanks for coming down.

415
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,150
Have a seat, Mr. Ehrmantraut.

416
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,780
Am I saying that right?

417
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,150
Close enough.

418
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,870
Once more, you're waiving your right

419
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,870
to have an attorney present?

420
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,360
Correct.

421
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,510
Could you state that

422
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,510
to the camera?

423
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,550
I'm waiving my right

424
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,550
to have an attorney present.

425
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,750
Okay, then.

426
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,750
We just have a few questions.

427
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:44,150
You're currently employed

428
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:44,150
by the Pollos Hermanos chain.

429
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,800
- Is that correct?

430
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,800
- Yes, I am.

431
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,270
- What do you do there?

432
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,270
- Corporate security.

433
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,510
- Corporate security.

434
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,510
- Yeah.

435
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:54,270
What's that?

436
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:54,270
Like guarding the special sauce?

437
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,590
I conduct employee

438
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,590
background checks.

439
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,360
I oversee loss prevention.

440
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,190
At a fast-food restaurant,

441
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,190
that's a full-time job?

442
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,510
We have 14 locations.

443
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,510
So, yes, it's a full-time job.

444
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:10,560
Yeah, well, if I were you,

445
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:10,560
I'd start sending out those résumés.

446
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,750
It says here

447
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,750
you're a private investigator?

448
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,870
- Where you licensed?

449
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,870
- New Mexico, Arizona, Utah.

450
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,910
Every state where we operate.

451
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,160
Colorado?

452
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,160
You have some restaurants there, right?

453
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,910
- Colorado doesn't require licensure.

454
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,910
- Licensed to carry a firearm?

455
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,760
- Concealed carry? Yes, I am.

456
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,760
- Which states?

457
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,790
It'd be quicker to mention

458
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,790
the states in which I'm not.

459
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,150
And if we pulled your CCPs,

460
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,150
everything would be in order?

461
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,190
I'm guessing you've already done that,

462
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,190
so you tell me.

463
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,540
You strike me as a former cop.

464
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,030
Am I right?

465
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,350
Where at?

466
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,190
- Philadelphia.

467
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,190
- Philly.

468
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:00,140
The City of Brotherly Love.

469
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:00,140
Turns out we know some folks there...

470
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,470
...and they told us that your tenure

471
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,470
as a police officer...

472
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,470
...ended somewhat dramatically?

473
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,910
- You wanna talk about that?

474
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,910
- Not particularly.

475
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,350
Yeah, me neither.

476
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,590
See, I'm more interested in why Gus Fring

477
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,590
decided to put a guy like you...

478
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,440
...in charge of his corporate security.

479
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,380
I mean, given your history...

480
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:29,270
...doing background checks

481
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:29,270
on pimple-faced fry cooks.

482
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,150
Seems like overkill.

483
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,590
What else you do for Fring?

484
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,670
He must've needed help

485
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,670
running that drug empire of his, no?

486
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,870
Drug empire?

487
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,870
First I'm hearing about that.

488
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,910
I don't know anything about that.

489
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:48,270
We have a guy that could

490
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:48,270
put you in that underground lab...

491
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:53,030
...and he'll testify to it. So from

492
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:53,030
here on out, this can go hard or easy.

493
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,030
So what's it gonna be?

494
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,830
Forget your handcuffs?

495
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:11,630
I'm confused.

496
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:11,630
Am I under arrest here, or am I not?

497
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,710
You wanna state that

498
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,710
for the camera?

499
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:29,030
You are not under arrest, currently.

500
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,590
Agents, do you have

501
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,590
any more questions for me?

502
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,710
Because you've got me very stirred up

503
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,710
with all these false accusations.

504
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,560
If I'm not under arrest,

505
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,560
I'd prefer to leave.

506
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,310
Oh, well....

507
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,510
I suppose we could talk about

508
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,510
the $2 million...

509
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,950
...in your granddaughter's name.

510
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,900
Yeah. It seems Fring had all these

511
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,900
secret offshore accounts...

512
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,830
...that he would deposit money into.

513
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,830
Like, well, an even dozen of them.

514
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,550
And they're all in the names

515
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,550
of certain people on his payroll.

516
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,790
The manager of the laundry...

517
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,110
...a couple guys from

518
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,110
the Pollos distribution centre.

519
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:17,950
There was the owner of a chemical

520
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:17,950
warehouse, a bunch of others.

521
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,550
You know, guys that must've been

522
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,550
getting paid off the books.

523
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:27,470
Anyway, one of the names

524
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:27,470
was Kaylee Ehrmantraut.

525
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,070
Ten years old

526
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,070
and just cute as a button.

527
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,390
Yeah. Two million and change

528
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,390
we found on deposit for her.

529
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,150
Way more than anybody else.

530
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,750
Now, my partner here,

531
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,750
he took one look at that and said:

532
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:47,230
"Shit, man. This fifth-grade girl is the

533
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:47,230
muscle behind Fring's entire operation."

534
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,150
I said, "Whoa, whoa, hey, partner,

535
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,150
slow down there.

536
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:55,150
Maybe it was actually

537
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:55,150
her dear old granddaddy."

538
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,910
Impressive, no?

539
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,910
That...level of insight?

540
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,070
He's not impressed, Gomey.

541
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,750
Perhaps he's picturing

542
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,750
all that money going bye-bye.

543
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:14,110
Yeah, well, I mean, the government's

544
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:14,110
gonna take every last dollar, unless....

545
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,110
Here's the thing, Mike-- Or Michael?

546
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,350
- Mr. Ehrmantraut.

547
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,350
- Here's the thing, Mike.

548
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,190
Lucky, you didn't touch that money.

549
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,390
I cannot say the same

550
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,390
for the other 11 on the list.

551
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,590
One of your guys is gonna roll...

552
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,110
...and then we'll definitely remember

553
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,110
the handcuffs.

554
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:35,110
Now, before that day comes,

555
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:35,110
you can do yourself a solid.

556
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,030
You can tell us what you know...

557
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,430
...you can tell us

558
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,430
who's still out there...

559
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,910
...and if we like your story...

560
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,320
...good things can happen.

561
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,040
Kaylee might be able

562
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,040
to keep some of that money.

563
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,910
Maybe.

564
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,470
So what do you say?

565
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,510
I don't know anything

566
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,510
about any money.

567
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,510
I don't know what you're talking about.

568
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:21,830
First order of business is to find a new

569
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:21,830
place to cook. Before anyone says it...

570
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,470
- ...no more RV's.

571
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,470
- I don't know.

572
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:27,420
- The crystal ship did pretty good for us.

573
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:27,420
- The "crystal ship"?

574
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,830
Yeah. That's what I called it.

575
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,510
Well, I'll admit, it held its own

576
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,510
as a starter lab...

577
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,070
...but it was too dark, too small...

578
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,190
...not to mention it could've broken down

579
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,190
at any moment.

580
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,670
Saul, find us someplace safe

581
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,670
from prying eyes.

582
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,030
Security against detection

583
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,030
is paramount.

584
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,350
But I don't wanna drive too far. No more

585
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,350
50-mile treks to some Indian reservation.

586
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:53,950
In town is trickier. I mean, you got

587
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:53,950
a lot more of your prying eyes.

588
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,870
If Gus can manage it,

589
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,870
then so can we.

590
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,950
Precursor. Where are we with that?

591
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:10,870
We're good on everything

592
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:10,870
except methylamine.

593
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,910
No surprise.

594
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,710
It's dry as hell out there.

595
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,230
What if we switched back

596
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,230
to a pseudo cook?

597
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,190
Absolutely out of the question.

598
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,270
Jesse, there is methylamine out there.

599
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,270
I know it.

600
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,030
Yeah, but what if there's not?

601
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,230
Because there isn't.

602
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,710
I mean, really.

603
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,200
There is.

604
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,600
Have faith.

605
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,430
Can I offer a thought?

606
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,910
Say a guy wins the lottery.

607
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,790
Ten million bucks.

608
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,790
The very next day,

609
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,790
what's the one thing he does not do?

610
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,510
He does not go buy another

611
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,510
lottery ticket, right?

612
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:50,460
He counts his lucky stars,

613
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:50,460
and he sails off into the sunset...

614
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,030
...which, seems to me,

615
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,030
and all due respect...

616
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,070
...some advice you two might take.

617
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,510
What lottery did I win, exactly?

618
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,870
Hey, you're alive.

619
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,910
I mean, as far as I'm concerned,

620
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,910
that's the Irish sweepstakes.

621
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,470
I'm alive, and I'm broke.

622
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:11,630
Counting the money that I owe Jesse,

623
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:11,630
I'm about 40 grand in the hole.

624
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,910
Does that seem like an acceptable

625
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,910
stopping point to you?

626
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,790
There is gold in the streets...

627
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,990
...just waiting for someone

628
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,990
to come and scoop it up.

629
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,390
But me, I should quit now.

630
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,390
Jesse, too, I suppose, huh?

631
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,110
I got you this time, kid.

632
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,350
Hey, how come you get two,

633
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,350
and I only get one?

634
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,790
Oh, what are you gonna--?

635
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,280
That one's mine!

636
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,560
Green is beating orange.

637
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,180
- No.

638
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,180
- Green is beating orange.

639
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,830
Pink is beating your yellow one.

640
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,430
I give up, baby.

641
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,870
You're too good.

642
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,520
Yeah?

643
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,230
It's me. You got a minute?

644
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,310
Yeah. A minute. What's up, Chow?

645
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,510
The DEA,

646
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,510
they call me to come back.

647
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,110
Say they want to talk more.

648
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,680
I'm sure they do.

649
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,280
Did you call your lawyer?

650
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,670
Yeah, but, Mike,

651
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,670
the DEA take all my money.

652
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,990
I need it.

653
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,030
I need my money.

654
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,950
You understand.

655
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,310
What do you want me

656
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,310
to do about it?

657
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,950
I don't know.

658
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:34,190
I don't know. We gotta talk.

659
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,880
Not on the phone.

660
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,350
Can you come to my house?

661
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,510
All right.

662
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,830
You give me two hours.

663
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,560
Chris.

664
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,430
I'd like you to drop your gun

665
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,430
where you stand...

666
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,790
...and then turn around very slowly.

667
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,460
Come on over

668
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,460
and sit next to Chow.

669
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,270
How much was she gonna pay you?

670
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,110
Ten thousand a name.

671
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,560
How far did you get down the list?

672
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,710
Just Chow.

673
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,590
I figured I'd start with you.

674
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,910
For you, she was gonna pay 30.

675
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,550
I'm really sorry about this, Mike,

676
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,550
but I needed the money.

677
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,870
Those feds, they took it all, man.

678
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,870
I know.

679
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,230
Are you ready?

680
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,230
Listen, Mike--

681
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,310
Kiira, come and have some cookies.

682
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,990
- It's a cookie!

683
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,990
- It's a cookie, yes!

684
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,990
Let's go.

685
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,870
Let's count.

686
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,950
Well, look at this.

687
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,950
What are you doing?

688
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,800
- Hey, Mommy!

689
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,800
- What are you doing still up?

690
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,510
Hey, yourself. Give me a kiss.

691
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:59,750
- She said she wanted to wait for you.

692
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:59,750
- She does, huh?

693
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,910
Well, who's the adult here, Delores?

694
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:06,590
- Tell me she ate her dinner, at least.

695
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:06,590
- Oh, yes, she ate everything.

696
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,350
She ate her peas, her carrots.

697
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,590
Do whatever it takes to keep them

698
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,590
out of here, or they die.

699
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,310
- A whole lot.

700
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,310
- Understand?

701
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,390
- Yep.

702
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,390
- That's right, my girl.

703
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:21,030
Delores, I'm gonna take a bath.

704
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:21,030
Put Kiira to bed and then go on home.

705
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,870
- I'll see you tomorrow.

706
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,870
- Really?

707
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:27,030
- You don't want me to wait for you?

708
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:27,030
- No, you go home. Thank you.

709
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,590
Sí, Miss Lydia.

710
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,510
Mommy, you gonna come

711
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,510
say good night to me?

712
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,240
Yeah, honey.

713
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,240
After Mommy takes a bath.

714
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,150
Okay.

715
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,510
Love you.

716
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,510
Mommy's very tired,

717
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,510
so let's go to bed.

718
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,160
Don't hurt my daughter.

719
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,470
I won't have to unless you scream.

720
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,670
You know why I'm here?

721
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,390
What are you waiting for?

722
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,990
The nanny to leave.

723
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:19,630
If you have anything to say to me,

724
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:19,630
now's the time.

725
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:30,030
Two good men died because of you.

726
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,750
Don't shoot me in the face.

727
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,560
Please. I don't want my daughter

728
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,560
seeing me like that.

729
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,830
- Your daughter won't see you.

730
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,830
- She will. She'll find me.

731
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,670
- She never once sleeps through the night.

732
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,670
- Nobody's gonna find you.

733
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,470
Wait. What?

734
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,710
No. No. No.

735
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,310
No. She has to find me.

736
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,040
- Lower your voice.

737
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,040
- She has to find me.

738
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,310
She has to find me.

739
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:01,630
You want your 5-year-old daughter

740
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:01,630
stumbling across your dead body?

741
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,830
I can't disappear.

742
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,830
She has to know I didn't leave her.

743
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,190
- She has to know that.

744
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,190
- Keep your voice down.

745
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,580
I don't care what you do.

746
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,870
I'll scream, and I'll keep screaming.

747
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,990
My daughter's not thinking

748
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,990
I abandoned her!

749
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:16,190
Shut up and calm down.

750
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:20,270
I don't care. You have to promise.

751
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:20,270
You have to promise me.

752
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,230
Promise I don't disappear.

753
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,910
Can you still get your hands

754
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,910
on methylamine?

755
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:08,110
Methylamine, Lydia.

756
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:08,110
Can you still get it?

757
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,150
Maybe.

758
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,240
Why?

759
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:42,390
- Yes?

760
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:42,390
- You still plan to move forward?

761
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,150
Yes, we do.

762
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,030
I've reconsidered.

763
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,830
I'm in.

764
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,460
Good.

765
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:15,670
Well, you missed a good meal.

766
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:20,310
The lasagna came out very well,

767
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:20,310
if I do say so myself.

768
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,230
I wrapped some up for you

769
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,230
if you'd like some later.

770
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,150
You know, it gets easier.

771
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:48,270
I promise you that it does.

772
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,470
What you're feeling right now...

773
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:58,350
...about Ted....

774
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,470
Everything.

775
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,310
It'll pass.

776
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,070
When we do...

777
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:05,030
...what we do for good reasons...

778
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:12,950
...then we've got

779
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:12,950
nothing to worry about.

780
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,710
And there's no better reason...

781
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,270
...than family.
