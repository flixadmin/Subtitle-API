1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,366
Previously on Gotham:

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,882
- I wish something would happen to Falcone.
- Who would take over then?

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,724
Let me guess.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,167
Maroni had nothing to do with
the armory job.

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,771
You have a mole obviously.

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,850
Someone close to you.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,047
Arkham Asylum.

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,810
Security guard for nut jobs?

9
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,166
Criminal nut jobs. Yeah.

10
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,562
Metal needles were inserted to the brain.

11
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,882
Electricity was applied
to his frontal lobes.

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,811
I want you to find out
which one of our inmates did this.

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,081
Well done, Aaron.

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,890
Exactly like I told you.

15
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,408
Now you are my best work so far.

16
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,090
No. Oh, no, no.

17
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,481
The merchandise has gotta be mint...

18
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,051
or you won't get a dime.

19
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,249
My God.

20
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,441
Jack.

21
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,329
Hi, lrvvin.

22
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,123
Where's my stuff?

23
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,885
Aaron Danzig...

24
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,250
6'4", 225, mental age of a young child.

25
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,331
We believe he's under the control
of this man.

26
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,403
Jack Gruber.

27
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,409
In Arkham off a rape-murder beef.

28
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,843
We can't find any records on Gruber
prior to his incarceration.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,082
So we're guessing Gruber is an alias.

30
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,687
We're sending his prints nationwide,
see if we could find another name.

31
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,003
Whoever he is, he's clever and angry...

32
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,646
and a grave public menace.

33
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,486
The commissioner is deeply concerned
and he is on his way here...

34
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,847
to talk to all of you right now.

35
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,520
You know what that means
and you know...

36
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,251
Jim?

37
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,562
- Captain.
- Hey, partner.

38
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,127
- Hi.
- You're out of your jurisdiction.

39
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,328
- Captain, this is my case.
- Jim.

40
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,084
- Get out of here.
- My case.

41
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,647
No, no, no. The captain is right.

42
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,246
You need to leave
before the commissioner gets here.

43
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,567
Why?

44
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,405
Because he holds you responsible
for all of this and... Oh, fudge.

45
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,961
He's here. And you're there. Side step.

46
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,527
- Captain Essen.
- Good morning, commissioner.

47
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,650
Officer Gordon, isn't it?

48
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,487
Yes, sir.

49
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,169
- Why are you here?
- I have a better question.

50
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,084
Why are you here, commissioner?

51
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,601
Excuse me?

52
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,805
This is the first I've seen you down here
with the rank and file.

53
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,924
You must be desperate.

54
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,049
Follow me.

55
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,120
Really nice knowing you.

56
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,248
Bring your friend Bullock.

57
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,487
I hate you.

58
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,483
I hate you.

59
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,440
It wasn't my idea, it was your friend.

60
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,080
He came up with the double-cross,
made me go along.

61
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,449
- You have a mind of your own, don't you?
- Hey, come on.

62
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,771
See?

63
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,645
Ha, ha. I kept your gadgets safe.

64
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,842
I know what it means to you. All of your...

65
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,527
experiments.

66
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,451
Oh, I appreciate that.

67
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,930
Please.

68
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,885
You don't have to kill me.

69
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,849
I don't...

70
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,602
have to do anything.

71
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,889
I'm free.

72
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,846
You know the funny thing? I think
it was my time in Arkham that freed me.

73
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,169
I mean, in here.

74
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,010
Now I see the world for what it really is.

75
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,687
An abandoned factory
full of broken machines.

76
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,888
Some...

77
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,644
very few...

78
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,727
can be fixed.

79
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,008
Most...

80
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,729
just have to be scrapped.

81
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,322
Danzig, hold him, please.

82
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,647
Please.

83
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,565
Please. No, stop, please.

84
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,449
Please.

85
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,730
Two maniacs on the loose makes the whole
Arkham project look kind of shady, huh?

86
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,689
The moneymen want results fast I bet.

87
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,049
You're strangely self-righteous.
It was you that let them escape.

88
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,601
Blame me all you want.
My name is already mud.

89
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,321
Those two will still be out there.
And that means you need me.

90
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,720
James.

91
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,843
Why did you become a policeman?

92
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,926
Your father was the district attorney.
A proud station for a man of substance...

93
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,845
you would think that would inspire a son
to practice law.

94
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,445
I'm enforcing the law.

95
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,325
You wanna talk about dad
or catch Gruber and Danzig?

96
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,006
Where do you get that rebellious fire
in your belly?

97
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,926
Can I take this opportunity to say
that I have no rebellious fire here.

98
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,844
Jack Gruber is out there.

99
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,365
Planning a catastrophe.

100
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,090
I know the man.

101
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,520
I know how he thinks.

102
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,650
- I know what he'll do next.
- Which is what?

103
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,650
That I'll keep to myself.

104
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,128
I guarantee I'll bring in these two men.

105
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,285
But first I need you to reinstate me
as detective first grade in the G.C.P.D.

106
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,410
Extortion, Officer Gordon.

107
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,206
Twenty four hours?

108
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,011
- What?
- You've got 24 hours to bring these men in.

109
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,482
You don't, you can both spend
the rest of your careers down at Arkham.

110
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,047
That will be all, detectives.

111
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,529
- What the hell just happened?
- It's okay. It's gonna be fine.

112
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,682
- Yeah?
- We just gotta catch the bad guys.

113
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,604
- Where are we going?
- I don't know.

114
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,364
What? You just told him...

115
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,444
you knew what Gruber
was gonna do next.

116
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,489
I lied.

117
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,926
Please.

118
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,360
Don Falcone.

119
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,726
Have mercy.

120
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,120
We're family.

121
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,731
I know, son.

122
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,405
I know it's hard.

123
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,286
A young man like you.

124
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,244
Doesn't seem fair.

125
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,970
Please.

126
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,246
Don Falcone, please!

127
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,241
This whole area used to be slums
when I was a boy.

128
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,602
You've come a long way.

129
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,845
Some of your people are looking for you,
you know.

130
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,562
But you're the one I wanted to see.

131
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,731
I've worked so long all my life
to get where I am.

132
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,965
So long I forget why I wanted to be here.

133
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,084
Well, you wanted to be someone
and you are.

134
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,530
I mean, look at all the stuff you have.

135
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,488
You're a good girl, Liza.

136
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,843
You need to find a young man
and get married, have babies.

137
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,526
It's not fair of me
keeping you cooped up here...

138
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,011
doing my house work.

139
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,845
You'll never find a good husband here.

140
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,884
Anyhow, if you'd like to...

141
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,444
get out in the world,
I was thinking I could...

142
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,730
set you up with a bakery
or some type of business like that.

143
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,647
So...

144
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,848
you can be independent.

145
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,771
That's really nice, Mr. F.
Thank you.

146
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,281
But I would rather be here with you.

147
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,087
You would?

148
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,480
I like it here.

149
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,448
You make me feel safe.

150
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,610
Well, good.

151
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,451
I like having you here.

152
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,531
Maybe I'll try to get a little work done
before dinner.

153
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,005
Making something special tonight.

154
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,246
What are you laughing at?

155
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,606
Ah, it's good to be back.

156
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,047
Only a man from an asylum
would say that.

157
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,965
You're like a rollercoaster
except you only go down.

158
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,800
Wouldn't that make him
more of an elevator?

159
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,766
You have anything useful? Got less
than 20 hours before I lose my job.

160
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,251
I do have something useful.

161
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,767
- And it is?
- I cross-checked fingerprints.

162
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,564
The clinically insane Jack Gruber of
Arkham, he's a figment of the files.

163
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,327
The man is really a career criminal
by the name of Jack Buchinsky.

164
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,802
- How is that even possible?
- Easy to bribe someone to change records.

165
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,769
He wanted to be transferred to Arkham.

166
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,009
It's really good work, Ed.

167
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,044
What's this Batinski's deal?

168
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,807
It's Buchinsky. It's all in the files.

169
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,210
Miss Kringle.

170
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,968
- I believe you left this on my desk.
- It's a riddle.

171
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,448
It's a cupcake with a live bullet
sticking out of it.

172
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,009
- It's a riddle.
- It's menacing and weird and inedible.

173
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,287
Thank you for the files, Miss Kringle.

174
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,642
This Buchinsky and his partners
pulled four successful bank robberies.

175
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,646
Killed six along the way
before G.C.P.D. caught him by accident.

176
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,167
- He never named his accomplices.
- He's in prison.

177
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,641
He hears Arkham is opening its doors.

178
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,442
He uses connections and gets a new identity
as patient Gruber.

179
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,936
- He must have good connections.
- Right.

180
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,804
When the rest of the nuts
get transferred to Arkham, voila.

181
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,803
So he had partners, huh?

182
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,725
Yeah. G.C.P.D. never identified them,
still out there.

183
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,121
Yup. We find them, we'll find him.

184
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,408
Easy enough, huh?

185
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,481
Detective.

186
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,447
A hit.

187
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,607
What have we got?

188
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,286
Hey, detective.
We dusted for prints, two sets.

189
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,408
Gruber and Danzig. Just like we thought.

190
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,528
- Thanks.
- All right.

191
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,244
Van checks out. It was them.

192
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,767
- Our man's an electronics freak, right?
- Yeah.

193
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,690
Think he went shopping?

194
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,524
He's dead. Fried like a donut.

195
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,051
Turn around slowly,
let me see those hands.

196
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,410
<i>Hey-</i>

197
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,368
Hey, buddy.

198
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,410
<i>Hey-</i>

199
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,843
Aah! No! No!

200
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,611
Get back in the store.

201
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,330
Please, there's been a terrible
mistake. I am Don Falcone's housekeeper.

202
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,131
Fish? Thank God.

203
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,325
Why did you have to pull me out like that?
You scared me.

204
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,124
It's time, Liza.

205
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,248
I'm gonna make my move on Falcone.

206
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,647
And don't be scared, baby girl.

207
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,165
I got this.

208
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,969
<i>Mr. Falcone, we have your girl Liza.</i>

209
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,924
<i>Would you like to see her again?</i>

210
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,485
Yes, I would.

211
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,608
<i>She'll be glad to hear that.</i>

212
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,526
For a fit young woman,
she has a low pain threshold.

213
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,925
Please, no. Stop.

214
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,402
<i>An intermediary
will be in contact with you soon.</i>

215
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,643
Don't hurt her. She's a civilian.

216
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,445
Hello?

217
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,967
What now?

218
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,330
Now we let him sit and think
about his life for a while.

219
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,283
The electrocutioner.

220
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,205
- Cute. No pressure.
- Don't worry. We'll get him.

221
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,364
- We got 17 hours to do so.
- I love the name.

222
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:34,241
It's catchy. It has drama.
The electrocutioner.

223
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,847
Speaking of which, given the
mode of attack, may I suggest...

224
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,163
you both wear your galoshes
while you're out in the field.

225
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,120
- Galoshes?
- In the event of electrical misadventure.

226
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,936
Your footwear should be insulated.

227
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,770
No, Mom. I'm not gonna wear my rubbers
on the case.

228
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,805
Nygma, give them here.

229
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,207
Seriously?

230
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,524
All right. So, what do we know?

231
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,366
Gruber wasn't too happy with lrvvin.

232
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,966
Maybe they were partners in crime.
Irwin turned on him.

233
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,088
- Gruber took the fall.
- Detective Gordon.

234
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,410
- Dr. Thompkins.
- My friends call me Lee.

235
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,927
Congratulations. You got your job back.

236
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,124
- Or not, depending. It's good to see you.
- Is it?

237
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,970
I know you're caught up with the escape.
That's why I'm here.

238
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,646
Is everything okay?
It must be chaos down there.

239
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,280
- We're getting by just fine.
- Ahem.

240
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,447
Oh, right.
This is my partner, Harvey Bullock.

241
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,610
- Detective Bullock.
- Who's your little friend there?

242
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,250
Oh, this is why I'm here.

243
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,324
- A woman in my wing is a pagan sorceress.
- Of course.

244
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,606
She's very popular.

245
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,764
Inmates make dolls to look like people
that they want to curse.

246
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,407
They give it to her to curse them
in exchange for soda and candy.

247
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,562
I curse you. You never give me candy.

248
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,720
I asked if Gruber had ever given her
a doll to curse and she said yes.

249
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,724
This is the doll. His name is Mr. M.

250
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,560
You owe me
for a double six-pack of root beer.

251
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,767
Mr. M.

252
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,400
- Mr. M.
- Mr. M.

253
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,165
Who does this look like to you?

254
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,124
I told this guy, I said, "Maurice...

255
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,810
we've pulled half of your teeth.

256
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,645
What are you waiting for?
The tooth fairy?"

257
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,880
So you know what Maurice does?
He smiles.

258
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,526
I'm gonna take out another.
I go to his molar.

259
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,001
Gotta get Mario and Gabe
to help me pull it out.

260
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,207
Do excuse me.

261
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,886
All right. We're pulling it,
we're pulling it, right?

262
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,169
Finally, we get it out.
The thing is this big.

263
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,846
- Yes?
- Come see me. <i>I need</i> you.

264
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,161
I'm on my way.

265
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,606
<i>What's wrong?</i>

266
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,445
Somebody took Liza. Come. Quickly.

267
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,564
Fish.

268
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,048
Sly devil.

269
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,528
You took her.

270
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,960
You're mine now.

271
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,288
I'm trying to tell this guy, let him talk.

272
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:10,570
He's trying to talk but I don't understand
him because he's got no teeth. Okay?

273
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,406
So I'm saying, let him talk. Clean him.
He's gonna tell us something.

274
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:18,004
Don Maroni, sir, forgive me.

275
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,844
Such fun we're having.

276
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,889
But I regret that I must run away.

277
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,042
If you'll let me.

278
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,811
My mother is sick.

279
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,204
A sick mother is a sick mother.

280
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,925
Go.

281
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,087
Hey.

282
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,480
Penguin, you all right?

283
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,570
Hey, kid, what...?

284
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,051
What's going on here?

285
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,168
My eyes are burning.

286
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,571
I don't know what happened.
It was like a silent bomb.

287
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,927
- You know who did this, right?
- Who?

288
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:23,722
A few years ago, Jack Buchinsky and
partners unknown knocked over four banks.

289
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,605
Killed six people.

290
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,321
Buchinsky went down for life.
His partners were never caught.

291
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,408
You're one of those partners.

292
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,723
One that took his share
and sold him up the river, I expect.

293
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,125
What guy was this?

294
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,811
Bu...

295
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,371
Who?

296
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:46,922
Well, he's out there looking to hurt you.
He doesn't care who else he hurts.

297
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,805
- Women, kids.
- Hey.

298
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,689
That's not my fault.

299
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,724
Help me do the right thing here,
Don Maroni.

300
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,530
- Let me place you in protective custody.
- Heh, heh.

301
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,688
- Protective custody?
- Yes.

302
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,171
Bait, you mean.

303
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,683
We catch our bad guy,
you get rid of a dangerous nuisance.

304
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,049
- We both come out ahead.
- Excuse me?

305
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,690
Hello?

306
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,087
I must be going.

307
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,324
Very urgent business.

308
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,086
With Falcone.

309
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,605
All right.

310
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,569
Make yourself at home.

311
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:51,370
Hey, sweetheart.
Get me a double espresso, extra sugar.

312
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,806
I'm Barbara.

313
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,089
Barbara Kean.

314
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,728
My parents. They live here.

315
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,086
It's very nice to see you, Barbara.

316
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,329
Isn't it, Everett?

317
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,926
Yes, very nice.

318
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,007
It's nice to see you too.

319
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,926
You've been well?

320
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,127
I hope.

321
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,290
Yes.

322
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,766
And you?

323
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,331
Splendid.

324
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,401
Are you staying the night?

325
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,884
Uh, if that's all right.

326
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:08,284
In fact I, I thought maybe
I could stay a few days.

327
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,283
If that's...

328
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,288
Oh, I see.

329
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,411
Yes, of course.

330
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,848
I'm sure you're going to be
frightfully bored.

331
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,968
But stay until the weekend.

332
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,088
By all means.

333
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,924
Thank you.

334
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,849
How's that young man of yours?

335
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,411
James.

336
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,489
The policeman.

337
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,920
All well, I hope?

338
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,970
Yes.

339
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,761
He's well. Thank you.

340
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,445
Good.

341
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,929
We're very happy-

342
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,444
Very haPPY-

343
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,649
You guys are hungry for this.

344
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,404
What do you do for excitement?

345
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:03,531
Remember the joke about the two cops and
the undertaker that go on a fishing boat?

346
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:08,004
When you use a goat as bait, shouldn't the
goat be out in the jungle, not in the house?

347
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,767
This house is the best defended spot
in Gotham.

348
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,926
Buchinsky is crazy
and arrogant and resourceful.

349
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,765
Wherever Maroni is, he'll come after him.

350
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,684
He'll enjoy the challenge.

351
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,127
Hey there.

352
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,726
Hi, boss.
How long have I been unconscious?

353
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,006
Couple of hours.

354
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,690
Oh, my gosh.

355
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,080
I must go.

356
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,401
My, my poor mother is...

357
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,360
Your mother can wait.

358
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,771
It's her heart.

359
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,007
Poor thing.

360
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,366
Valves.

361
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,410
She might be taken at any moment.

362
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:55,487
But... But by all means,
of course, she can wait.

363
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:01,200
When you woke up before,
you said you had urgent business...

364
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,610
with Falcone.

365
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,524
I did?

366
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:11,049
I said that, did I?

367
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,640
Carmine.

368
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,083
Some people have called me
about your girl Liza.

369
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,767
They want me to help make a deal.

370
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,807
I didn't think it was going to be you.

371
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,367
I'm sorry.

372
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,086
I'm just an intermediary.

373
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,480
<i>I just wanna help.</i>

374
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,405
Please, my dear, stop.

375
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,210
<i>I know this is you.</i>

376
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,129
<i>Be honest.</i>

377
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,204
- It's me.
- Of course <i>it</i> is.

378
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,840
How long have I known you?

379
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,844
You're the smart one in the family,
didn't I always say so?

380
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,042
She won't be hurt.

381
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,202
Leave Gotham, that's all.

382
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,203
Leave Gotham, never come back.

383
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,885
You can take her with you.

384
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,650
Agreed.

385
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,043
<i>That's the right decision.
I'll make the arrangements.</i>

386
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,321
You were always my favorite.

387
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,882
Wait for my call.

388
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,361
He's leaving?

389
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,645
You did it?

390
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,525
Boss.

391
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,921
The genius, the vision.

392
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,649
You brought down the old man. Finally.

393
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,167
Let's celebrate.

394
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,649
Butch, this is not the time to celebrate.

395
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,041
He was a great man once.

396
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,090
You don't think somebody
would take him out if he stayed on.

397
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:57,962
I am doing him a favor
and giving him an easy way out.

398
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,448
I owe him...

399
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,768
at least that.

400
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,449
Of course. You're right.

401
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,125
It's best for everyone.

402
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,522
How did he sound?

403
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,564
Sad.

404
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,283
Look at me.

405
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,325
Is there something you're not telling me?

406
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,161
No.

407
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,360
You're gonna have to leave town with him.
String him along for a while.

408
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,244
Do you think you can do that?

409
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,482
- Sure.
- Sure.

410
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,847
But you like him though, don't you?

411
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,488
Well, I can like him, can't I?

412
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,250
He's been a perfect gentleman.

413
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,006
He could've done anything...

414
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,687
and he never laid a hand on me.

415
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,081
Liza, you can like him all you want.

416
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,809
But you can never tell him the truth.

417
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,405
I know that.

418
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,484
Sir.

419
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,122
Let me go to work.

420
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,490
No.

421
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,920
No?

422
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,522
If Fish and the others...

423
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,848
And there must be others.

424
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,604
If they all want me to step away so badly,
maybe it's time.

425
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,644
Why not?

426
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,409
Why am I still here fighting?

427
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,564
For what?

428
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,687
For respect.

429
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,449
You're Don Carmine Falcone.

430
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,965
Respect?

431
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,128
Who cares?

432
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,240
They all want me to go live
in the country with Liza.

433
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,608
I would like that.

434
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,968
That's what I want too.

435
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,849
So why not do it?

436
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:07,321
Please don't talk that way, sir.

437
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,681
Just me on my own...

438
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,161
I can take out Fish's crew easy.

439
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,930
You're not listening, Victor.

440
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:24,450
Your job is to keep me and Liza safe
through the coming transaction.

441
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,770
That's all.

442
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,490
Yes, sir.

443
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,921
- Miss Kringle.
- Ah! What?

444
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,127
What?

445
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,282
The cupcake is sweet, the bullet is deadly.

446
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,761
A beautiful woman is a dangerous thing.

447
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,724
Uh, listen, I...

448
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,360
That is so...

449
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,201
I don't... I don't even know
what to say to that.

450
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,408
Nygma, you perv, back off.

451
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:08,082
Can't you see
the lady doesn't want you bugging her?

452
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,322
Hey there.
Hey, now. Who's bugging who?

453
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,721
I'm just... I'm just...

454
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,326
What's green and then red?
Frogs in a blender.

455
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,165
Walk away, Nygma.

456
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,320
Walk away.

457
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,685
I'm very sorry if I offended you, Miss
Kringle. That was not my intention.

458
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,567
- Do you hear that?
- Go.

459
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,881
Thank you.

460
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,211
He is so weird.

461
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,330
I have no business with Falcone.

462
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,249
I swear on my mother's life.

463
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,325
May God strike her dead
with horrible torments if I'm lying.

464
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,170
Okay then, my friend.

465
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,047
I'm sorry I doubted you.

466
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,561
Go see your morn.

467
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,489
- Give her a kiss from me.
- Thank you.

468
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,362
What the hell's going on here?

469
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,091
- Hey, hey!
- What's going on?

470
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,607
Ah, there's the one.

471
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,161
Under that funny looking fella there.

472
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,249
Take him to the truck.

473
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,891
They didn't cook, just stunned.

474
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:06,126
I expected more oomph.

475
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,324
You want oomph, Jack?

476
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,891
Ah.

477
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,008
Officer Gordon.

478
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,205
Nice shoes.

479
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,966
Detective Gordon.

480
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,204
Hands up, both of you.

481
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,640
You might wanna drop that.

482
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,089
Why fight me, Gordon?

483
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:47,290
Who here deserves your protection?
Any of them?

484
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,250
- All of them.
- Even Maroni? Please.

485
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:55,122
Just let me kill this false friend
and get on with my life.

486
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,209
All this fight, and for what?

487
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,689
I'm putting you back in Arkham, Jack.

488
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,161
That's closer to the mark now,
isn't it, Jim?

489
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,648
You need to win, don't you?

490
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:25,010
You pretend to care about the law but in
your heart, it's all primitive ego...

491
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,481
and your lust for blood and power.

492
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,530
You just hate to lose.

493
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,802
You know what? You're right.

494
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,162
I do hate to lose.

495
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,322
Congratulations, young man.

496
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,323
New day.

497
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,645
New day.

498
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:14,890
Next man that tries to take away my shield,
one way or another, I'll make him eat it.

499
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,970
Say again.

500
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,248
New day, commissioner.

501
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:38,046
I hope you have some nasty pictures of him,
because I bet what you said was very rude.

502
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,649
I'm done being careful.

503
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,723
You think you've been careful so far?

504
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,008
Men like Commissioner Loeb
are never gonna trust me.

505
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:48,004
- You think you've been careful so far?
- So why play nice?

506
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:53,371
- You think you've been careful so far'?
- Don't worry, I know what I'm doing.

507
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,601
Let's go grab a beer.

508
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,484
Now you're messing with my mind.

509
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,371
I need something stronger than beer.

510
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,690
Hush, young man.

511
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,366
I can hear you sigh.

512
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,242
Sorry, sir.

513
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,326
Let him be.

514
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,001
It's good to see you, old friend.

515
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,848
I am so sorry
it took me so long to get here.

516
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,082
Such a day I've had.

517
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,685
I won't even tell you.

518
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,210
But I'm here.

519
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,522
You were right about Fish.

520
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,569
It's her that's taken Liza.

521
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,803
Sir, allow me.

522
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,969
I must tell you what I've discovered.

523
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,402
You're not gonna want to hear this.

524
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,800
Speak.

525
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,681
Liza was planted on you by Fish.

526
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,646
She belongs to Fish.

527
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,691
This was a setup from the start.

528
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,961
She found a girl that looked just like
your mother and trained her to... Unh!

529
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,610
No.

530
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,687
I'm sorry.

531
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,486
- Prove that.
- How?

532
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,442
I can't.

533
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,971
I just know.

534
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,401
You're wrong.

535
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,521
When have I been wrong?

536
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,766
<i>Hello, Fish.</i>

537
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,604
Don Falcone.

538
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,410
We will meet at my place.

539
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,085
Acceptable?

540
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,844
<i>Yes.</i>

541
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,604
<i>Is she there? ls Liza there now?</i>

542
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,565
<i>- Can I speak to her?
- No.</i>

543
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,524
What time?

544
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,649
<i>In an hour.</i>

545
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,130
I'll be there.

546
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,086
Fish.

547
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,808
Don Falcone.

548
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,365
How's this work?

549
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,090
Liza is close by.

550
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,686
All I need for you to do is sign papers.

551
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,326
Relinquish all control of the family...

552
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,562
and then you're both free to leave.

553
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,166
Papers.

554
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,322
You think papers make a don?

555
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,688
I'm offering you a way out, Carmine.

556
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,605
I appreciate that. Thank you.

557
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,684
But I need to see her first.

558
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,844
Before I sign anything,
I need to know she's all right.

559
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,286
She's fine.

560
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,401
I need to see her, or no deal.

561
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,801
Are you all right?

562
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,440
I'm okay.

563
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,326
How long have you known Fish Mooney?

564
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,321
Huh?

565
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,651
I don't.

566
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,928
I just met her now.

567
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,525
No.

568
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:49,521
A little bird told me
you and she have been friends for a while.

569
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,646
No.

570
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:57,170
Told me that she told you stuff about my
mother so that I'd get all caught up in you.

571
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,369
Because Fish knows,
you know, about my mother.

572
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,451
You know how much I love my mother.

573
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:09,247
Because we talked about her all the time,
you and me.

574
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,402
Remember, Fish, back in the day?

575
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,647
I do.

576
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,009
It seems as though a little bird
has been making a bit of mischief.

577
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,605
Yes...

578
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,967
that's what I had hoped.

579
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,487
But the truth is plain to see.

580
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:26,361
I'm very disappointed
at my own stupidity.

581
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,645
I'm sorry, Liza.

582
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,887
Is that your name?

583
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,690
I'm sorry you had to get mixed up in this.

584
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:56,366
Because I'm sure
you're a good, honest girl, really.

585
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,325
No.

586
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,447
I want these two alive for now.

587
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,011
Lock them up some place.

588
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:52,004
Don't bother yelling for help.
All of your people are dead.

589
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:55,364
Carmine, you have to under...

590
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,044
I can forgive all kinds of betrayal
and dishonesty.

591
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,127
But my mother...

592
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:07,249
How dare you use
my sainted mother against me?

593
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,011
That's wrong!

594
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,049
- You'll suffer for that.
- I need you...

595
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,124
Thank you, Fish.

596
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:21,002
For the first time in a long time,
I feel alive.

597
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,163
I remember who I am.

598
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,120
I remember why I'm here.

599
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,647
- Just listen...
- You can come out now.

600
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,802
Right as usual, my friend.

601
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,040
Say your goodbyes quickly.

602
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,051
Miss Mooney has places to go.

603
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,285
Hello, Fish.

604
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,001
Hi.

605
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,325
Dr. Thompkins.

606
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,927
Lee.

607
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,965
Lee.

608
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,366
The desk sergeant said
it was okay to come back here.

609
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,971
I didn't mean to disturb you.

610
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,884
No, no. It's okay. Something wrong?

611
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,168
No. I was in the area.

612
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:53,409
And, uh, my sorceress
wants her doll back.

613
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,449
Right. Yeah.

614
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,043
Is that why you're here?

615
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,570
Yes.

616
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,166
No.

617
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,971
She does want her doll back...

618
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,407
but not entirely. No.

619
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,681
You live here?

620
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,203
I'm sort of between places right now.

621
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,527
I don't know why I'm here.

622
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,011
Sorry.

623
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,889
A whim.

624
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,527
Wait.

625
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,323
Hey, Gordon, did you hear?

626
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,683
There's been a big shootout
at Fish Mooney's place.
