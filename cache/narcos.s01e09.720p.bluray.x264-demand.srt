1
00:00:54,394 --> 00:00:57,064
Good morning, Sergeant.

2
00:00:57,273 --> 00:00:59,607
Good morning, Paisa.
What have you got for us?

3
00:00:59,608 --> 00:01:04,612
I've got plumbing valves,
a bunch of clean towels,

4
00:01:04,613 --> 00:01:06,699
and extra uniforms for the guards.

5
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:17,335
Let him go. He's been checked.

6
00:01:17,543 --> 00:01:19,337
Continue. Continue, Paisa.

7
00:01:19,545 --> 00:01:21,213
Thank you, Sergeant.

8
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:23,007
- Good day.
- Good day.

9
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:26,468
- Good day, Paisa.
- Thank you! Good day, Sergeant.

10
00:01:36,354 --> 00:01:39,356
Escobar's prison was called La Catedral,

11
00:01:39,357 --> 00:01:42,151
but we nicknamed it "Club Medellín."

12
00:01:42,985 --> 00:01:45,321
It was the embodiment of "the big lie."

13
00:01:45,529 --> 00:01:49,241
It was even built
to look old and shitty on the outside.

14
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:52,661
But inside, it was anything but.

15
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:57,332
The other inmates?
Escobar's sicarios.

16
00:01:57,333 --> 00:02:00,086
Hand-picked killers from his hometown.

17
00:02:02,046 --> 00:02:05,048
You're here, my friend!

18
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:07,800
- How you doing, Velasco?
- Good, brother. How was the trip?

19
00:02:07,801 --> 00:02:09,844
Fine, fine.
What a long drive!

20
00:02:09,845 --> 00:02:11,637
- Really?
- It's really hot.

21
00:02:11,638 --> 00:02:13,056
Did you encounter any problems?

22
00:02:13,057 --> 00:02:15,808
Nothing. Perfect. Complete success.

23
00:02:15,809 --> 00:02:20,063
I brought everything, including
the special items requested by Pablo.

24
00:02:20,064 --> 00:02:21,856
- What's going on, buddy?
- Blackie!

25
00:02:21,857 --> 00:02:25,485
- I thought you forgot about us.
- Let me show you.

26
00:02:27,738 --> 00:02:31,991
Oh, my God. All right, boys!
Get a ladder over here!

27
00:02:31,992 --> 00:02:36,121
The sicarios weren't the only guys
in the prison who worked for Escobar.

28
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:37,789
The guards did, too.

29
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,292
- Welcome to La Catedral.
- Hello.

30
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:44,212
Come on down, ladies.

31
00:02:44,213 --> 00:02:46,340
We'll take care of you.

32
00:02:51,387 --> 00:02:53,346
By the terms of his deal,

33
00:02:53,347 --> 00:02:58,310
no cops or military were allowed
within two miles of the prison.

34
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:02,439
As much as I fucking hated this guy,
I had to hand it to him...

35
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,524
he had a pretty sweet deal.

36
00:03:17,455 --> 00:03:20,624
Come on! Hurry up!
What? Is it heavy?

37
00:03:21,917 --> 00:03:24,962
- That looks delicious, Paisa.
- All right, lobsters.

38
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:06,127
Escobar hadn't
built himself a prison at all.

39
00:04:06,128 --> 00:04:08,714
He'd built himself a fortress.

40
00:04:08,922 --> 00:04:13,260
But no matter how you decorate it...
a cage is still a cage.

41
00:04:42,122 --> 00:04:43,541
Excuse me, boss.

42
00:04:44,124 --> 00:04:45,750
I've got a report.

43
00:04:45,751 --> 00:04:48,545
Moncada and Galeano
are reporting that we got 10,000 kilos

44
00:04:48,546 --> 00:04:50,922
through Mexico and the Caribbean.

45
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:53,091
Did they pay the war tax?

46
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:56,469
Yes, boss, but ever since
you settled things with the government,

47
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,764
a lot of other people
have been complaining.

48
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:06,145
My expenses in and out of the prison
must be covered by everyone.

49
00:05:06,146 --> 00:05:07,314
Understood.

50
00:05:07,523 --> 00:05:11,277
Moncada and Galeano said the Cali cartel
are preparing for a ceasefire.

51
00:05:11,485 --> 00:05:12,945
Mm.

52
00:05:13,612 --> 00:05:15,406
As am I.

53
00:05:17,657 --> 00:05:21,077
We're going to negotiate a truce.

54
00:05:21,078 --> 00:05:24,957
But first,
we're going to kill a few of his men.

55
00:05:27,585 --> 00:05:31,670
I'm sorry, boss, but the Cali cartel
is going to take that as an act of war,

56
00:05:31,671 --> 00:05:33,424
don't you think?

57
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:43,934
The purpose of war...

58
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,895
is peace.

59
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:53,401
If there was one benefit
to Escobar's imprisonment,

60
00:05:53,402 --> 00:05:56,488
it's that peace
had finally come to Bogotá.

61
00:05:56,489 --> 00:06:00,492
Connie and I took advantage
and began adoption proceedings.

62
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:02,828
The war had left many orphans.

63
00:06:03,036 --> 00:06:06,581
One... we could do something about.

64
00:06:06,582 --> 00:06:10,585
Oh, you like the pink ones,
don't you? Yeah, you do.

65
00:06:10,586 --> 00:06:13,130
Oh, orchids, look!

66
00:06:14,131 --> 00:06:16,383
What's this one? "Cattleya."

67
00:06:17,384 --> 00:06:19,469
It means "graceful." Hm.

68
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:22,722
That describes me perfectly.

69
00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:30,438
Oh, buying baby things
and plants for the apartment...

70
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:32,482
we're a family.

71
00:06:32,483 --> 00:06:34,609
We're domesticated animals.

72
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:36,319
- You want this one?
- Yeah.

73
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,989
You want that one? Yeah.

74
00:06:44,119 --> 00:06:45,496
How about Elizabeth?

75
00:06:46,413 --> 00:06:48,332
After my mother?
Are you kidding?

76
00:06:49,749 --> 00:06:54,296
What is "Elizabeth" in Spanish?
Is it "Isabel"? Isabel's nice.

77
00:06:54,505 --> 00:06:57,799
- I've always liked "Olivia."
- Olivia's OK.

78
00:07:03,347 --> 00:07:05,098
Fuck.

79
00:07:06,475 --> 00:07:08,519
Shit!

80
00:07:10,728 --> 00:07:13,106
- What's the deal?
- Steve...

81
00:07:13,315 --> 00:07:14,795
Look what you've done to my car.

82
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,734
- Where?
- Look at this traffic jam.

83
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:19,153
- Look what you did to my car!
- Ah! It's nothing.

84
00:07:19,154 --> 00:07:21,072
- How am I gonna drive this?
- It's nothing.

85
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:23,032
Look at the fucking traffic jam
this is causing.

86
00:07:23,033 --> 00:07:24,033
Yeah, man!

87
00:07:28,121 --> 00:07:30,289
And you don't even speak Spanish?
Get out of here.

88
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:32,291
- Don't mess with me, asshole.
- Easy, man.

89
00:07:32,292 --> 00:07:36,963
Son of a bitch. Are you gonna hit me?
What the hell have you come here for, fag?

90
00:07:37,172 --> 00:07:39,716
I deserve respect, you son of a bitch.
So that's it, then.

91
00:07:39,717 --> 00:07:42,428
What, are you gonna hit me?
You and who else?

92
00:07:42,636 --> 00:07:44,679
Oh, my...

93
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,350
OK, take it easy.
It's all right. It's OK now.

94
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:53,438
- Calm down, asshole.
- OK?

95
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:56,065
- Relax, man. OK.
- OK?

96
00:07:56,066 --> 00:07:57,984
OK, calm down.

97
00:07:58,944 --> 00:08:00,654
Have some tolerance.

98
00:08:12,332 --> 00:08:15,294
Yeah, I like "Olivia."

99
00:09:56,687 --> 00:10:00,022
- Do you hear that?
- What?

100
00:10:00,023 --> 00:10:03,861
People. Children. Laughter.

101
00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:07,364
Even the vendors are back out.

102
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:14,412
And all because we gave Escobar
the keys to his own prison.

103
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:16,664
You did the right thing.

104
00:10:16,665 --> 00:10:18,291
You think?

105
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,462
You should be happy.

106
00:10:23,505 --> 00:10:26,716
Finally, people can return
to their normal lives.

107
00:10:26,717 --> 00:10:29,595
Finally... we are at peace.

108
00:10:52,409 --> 00:10:56,747
We spoke with Pablo,
and he is willing to negotiate.

109
00:11:01,167 --> 00:11:04,129
Ten of my men have just been killed.

110
00:11:04,337 --> 00:11:06,924
Is that how you guys
begin negotiations?

111
00:11:07,883 --> 00:11:09,342
Two things, Pacho.

112
00:11:09,551 --> 00:11:16,307
First... Mr. Galeano and I
had nothing to do with those deaths.

113
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:20,728
And the second thing...
this is war, Pacho.

114
00:11:20,729 --> 00:11:24,775
There are deaths everywhere,
and we have casualties as well.

115
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:31,739
We are willing
to pay three million dollars

116
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,201
to settle the dispute in Los Angeles.

117
00:11:37,287 --> 00:11:40,039
Pablo won't accept anything
under $12 million, Pacho.

118
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:45,211
Twelve million is nothing to you.

119
00:11:49,549 --> 00:11:51,343
Do you want to know something?

120
00:11:51,551 --> 00:11:53,887
It's over.

121
00:11:54,095 --> 00:11:56,263
What's over?

122
00:11:56,264 --> 00:11:59,558
The Medellín cartel.

123
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:01,937
No, you're wrong, Pacho.

124
00:12:02,145 --> 00:12:05,230
We export twice the amount you do.

125
00:12:05,231 --> 00:12:08,986
You invited me here
to give me this line of bullshit?

126
00:12:09,945 --> 00:12:15,115
Pablo put a war tax on the two of you
for $250,000 a month.

127
00:12:15,116 --> 00:12:17,034
That's how he treats
his friends and associates?

128
00:12:17,243 --> 00:12:22,331
Don't forget that, thanks to
Mr. Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria,

129
00:12:22,332 --> 00:12:26,628
extradition was abolished.
That serves you very well, doesn't it?

130
00:12:26,837 --> 00:12:29,338
He was the one
who got us into this mess.

131
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:34,177
Killing politicians and cops,
bombing street corners and airplanes.

132
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:37,389
He started this fucking war.

133
00:12:39,599 --> 00:12:41,643
Are we going to negotiate or not?

134
00:12:45,062 --> 00:12:49,651
As part of Escobar's
surrender deal, Search Bloc was disbanded,

135
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,904
and Colonel Carrillo
was transferred out of the country.

136
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:57,616
For the time being,
Carrillo's war was over.

137
00:12:57,617 --> 00:13:00,536
I don't see why
they're sending you to Spain.

138
00:13:00,537 --> 00:13:02,078
It's not like the cocaine war is over.

139
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,916
Galeano and Moncada
are fronting for Escobar.

140
00:13:06,209 --> 00:13:08,003
My superiors say I play too rough.

141
00:13:09,629 --> 00:13:14,175
At least Escobar is in jail and... you can
leave knowing you helped put him there.

142
00:13:15,969 --> 00:13:17,303
Jail?

143
00:13:18,847 --> 00:13:21,975
I know you gringos
aren't allowed to do flyovers, but um...

144
00:13:23,351 --> 00:13:26,479
I got some photographs,
courtesy of the Colombian military.

145
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:32,945
I want you to look at 'em,
tell me if this qualifies as a jail.

146
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,409
He's got a fucking soccer field.

147
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:41,619
Escobar is moving more coke than ever.

148
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,913
Without the Colombian government
breathing down his neck,

149
00:13:43,914 --> 00:13:46,291
all he's gotta worry about
is the Cali cartel.

150
00:13:49,252 --> 00:13:51,170
Let's face it, fellas...

151
00:13:53,298 --> 00:13:55,383
he won.

152
00:13:59,763 --> 00:14:01,680
We're here, gentlemen!

153
00:14:06,269 --> 00:14:08,938
- Gentlemen!
- What a bumpy ride, Paisa.

154
00:14:08,939 --> 00:14:11,190
Where did you learn to drive?

155
00:14:12,025 --> 00:14:14,860
We closed the deal at ten million dollars.

156
00:14:14,861 --> 00:14:18,197
This takes care of the problem
we had in LA and ends the war.

157
00:14:19,783 --> 00:14:21,993
Sounds like a good proposition.

158
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:24,328
Do you know what this means, boss?

159
00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:28,206
We can maintain our infrastructure
and the government won't be the wiser.

160
00:14:28,207 --> 00:14:33,505
That way, we can... double our exports
in less than a month, Pablo.

161
00:14:37,634 --> 00:14:39,344
How did he behave...

162
00:14:40,345 --> 00:14:42,388
when he offered you the money?

163
00:14:44,182 --> 00:14:46,518
What do you mean,
"how did he behave"?

164
00:14:47,602 --> 00:14:49,354
What was his attitude?

165
00:14:50,355 --> 00:14:52,691
Well... he was respectful, Pablo.

166
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:54,692
Respectful in what way?

167
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:57,862
- He wants peace, just like us.
- Yes, but...

168
00:14:57,863 --> 00:15:00,907
how did he react
when you told him our solution?

169
00:15:01,116 --> 00:15:02,741
In a positive manner.

170
00:15:02,742 --> 00:15:05,078
He just offered you the money,
just like that?

171
00:15:06,997 --> 00:15:11,334
Well... he started
at three million dollars. Right?

172
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:13,419
- Mm.
- But we said no,

173
00:15:13,628 --> 00:15:15,337
and told him
you wouldn't take less than 12.

174
00:15:15,338 --> 00:15:19,551
So he offered ten,
and we felt that was a fair deal.

175
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:22,971
Offered you three million?

176
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:28,185
He was feeling us out.
He knew we wouldn't accept that.

177
00:15:28,393 --> 00:15:34,149
If he really respected me,
he would be grateful if I accepted 20.

178
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,778
That's right, boss.
Ask for 20. In one shot.

179
00:15:44,617 --> 00:15:47,495
Tell him I'm not happy
with less than 30.

180
00:15:48,705 --> 00:15:50,540
The Cali cartel won't accept that, Pablo.

181
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:54,961
Thirty million...
if Cali wants peace.

182
00:16:20,195 --> 00:16:21,738
Very good.

183
00:16:29,996 --> 00:16:33,083
I also need to raise the war tax.

184
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:39,337
From now on, a million a month,

185
00:16:39,338 --> 00:16:43,009
for both of you...
and all our other partners.

186
00:16:52,102 --> 00:16:54,980
Good move beating him,
you son of a bitch.

187
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:02,527
If we get proof that Escobar
is violating the terms of his surrender,

188
00:17:02,528 --> 00:17:04,238
then they have to send him
to a real prison,

189
00:17:04,239 --> 00:17:06,157
but we need more
than these aerial shots.

190
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:08,492
Can you get us satellite communications
or wire intercepts?

191
00:17:08,493 --> 00:17:11,162
There's a no-fly zone over the prison,
with antiaircraft guns

192
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:13,455
manned by the Colombian army
to enforce it.

193
00:17:13,456 --> 00:17:15,457
You're playing with fire
if Noonan finds out.

194
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,542
We don't got shit on him
without intercepts.

195
00:17:17,543 --> 00:17:19,628
- Don't need 'em.
- What? The hell we don't.

196
00:17:19,629 --> 00:17:21,298
They're not using phones.

197
00:17:22,257 --> 00:17:24,675
- The hell is that?
- I could spot a coop a mile away.

198
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:26,719
That's how they're sending messages.

199
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,850
To avoid our high-tech spy planes,

200
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:36,812
Pablo chose the most
low-tech form of communication.

201
00:17:36,813 --> 00:17:39,024
Never said the guy wasn't crafty.

202
00:17:41,943 --> 00:17:44,196
- You see anything yet?
- No, man.

203
00:17:45,155 --> 00:17:47,157
You're blind as a bat.
Give me those.

204
00:17:59,669 --> 00:18:03,172
Oh, one's goin'.

205
00:18:03,173 --> 00:18:06,343
- Ten o'clock. Comin' in low.
- I got it.

206
00:18:07,302 --> 00:18:08,344
- You got it?
- Yeah.

207
00:18:08,345 --> 00:18:09,387
Low.

208
00:18:12,932 --> 00:18:13,975
Ah...

209
00:18:15,434 --> 00:18:17,187
That's a fast fucking pigeon.

210
00:18:18,563 --> 00:18:19,980
Give me the gun.

211
00:18:19,981 --> 00:18:23,275
- You trying to say I'm a lousy shot?
- Yes, I am saying you're a lousy shot.

212
00:18:23,276 --> 00:18:24,569
Here.

213
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:28,990
You're a shit shot.

214
00:18:29,199 --> 00:18:31,116
- Heads up, heads up.
- I got it.

215
00:18:31,117 --> 00:18:33,036
- One o'clock.
- I got it.

216
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:35,121
Shoot.

217
00:18:35,955 --> 00:18:36,955
Shoot!

218
00:18:41,794 --> 00:18:43,380
Ever been duck huntin'?

219
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:51,596
No, I have not been duck hunting,
you... fucking hillbilly.

220
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:01,147
Bingo.

221
00:19:04,442 --> 00:19:06,611
It's in Spanish. Read it.

222
00:19:09,322 --> 00:19:14,035
"Delivery due
with El Paisa in the tunnel."

223
00:19:15,661 --> 00:19:18,497
The son of a bitch
built a tunnel under the jail.

224
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:23,919
We talked with Pablo
and reached an agreement.

225
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,255
- Mm-hm?
- Mm-hm.

226
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:28,841
We agreed to...

227
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:32,553
- one million dollars.
- What?

228
00:19:36,182 --> 00:19:37,434
Right.

229
00:19:40,353 --> 00:19:42,604
What about the house in Cartagena?

230
00:19:42,605 --> 00:19:44,481
That's not happening, right?

231
00:19:44,482 --> 00:19:46,900
Do you want your house in Cartagena?

232
00:19:46,901 --> 00:19:50,654
- Of course.
- OK... you will have it.

233
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,239
Don't you see
things are improving?

234
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,201
No, I see things
are getting more complicated.

235
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:59,872
Instead of getting better...
things are getting worse.

236
00:20:00,748 --> 00:20:02,041
Mm-hm.

237
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:07,838
Pablo doesn't want peace with Cali.

238
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,924
Now, what about this war tax
he's charging you?

239
00:20:10,925 --> 00:20:14,845
$250,000 was a lot of money.

240
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:18,056
- And now a million?
- Ridiculous.

241
00:20:18,057 --> 00:20:22,227
What do you think I should do?
Call Pablo and tell him I won't pay it?

242
00:20:22,228 --> 00:20:24,646
- Obviously not.
- Then I don't understand.

243
00:20:24,647 --> 00:20:29,735
- What do you want me to do?
- It's not right, Kiko, and you know it.

244
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:36,742
Look, I... adore Pablo.
I adore him.

245
00:20:39,787 --> 00:20:43,041
But the thing is, I don't know
what's going on with him these days.

246
00:20:49,714 --> 00:20:52,300
I don't know.
Maybe he's depressed.

247
00:20:53,176 --> 00:20:58,264
We're here in a Jacuzzi...

248
00:20:59,349 --> 00:21:01,142
free.

249
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:07,481
- Do you love me?
- Oh...

250
00:21:07,482 --> 00:21:10,985
Stop fucking around.
You make me angry.

251
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:19,493
Against orders, we did
high-altitude flyovers of the prison

252
00:21:19,494 --> 00:21:21,953
- with our infrared cameras.
- No tunnels.

253
00:21:21,954 --> 00:21:25,874
Tomography report indicates nothing.
Seismic measuring, nada.

254
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,419
Can we measure radio frequency energy?

255
00:21:27,626 --> 00:21:30,212
Well, we could try.
Doesn't penetrate deeper than 30 feet.

256
00:21:30,213 --> 00:21:33,258
If he's bringing shit into this tunnel,
you can bet he's going out that way.

257
00:21:33,466 --> 00:21:37,053
If there's a tunnel there,
he must have dug it to China.

258
00:21:37,762 --> 00:21:38,762
Good luck.

259
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,065
Maybe we can...

260
00:21:50,233 --> 00:21:53,277
We can ask the military
to do light detection and ranging.

261
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:56,489
We got a better chance of Noonan
authorizing a divining rod.

262
00:21:59,867 --> 00:22:02,702
- All right, man, I'm calling it a night.
- Nah, finish up.

263
00:22:02,703 --> 00:22:04,705
No, you can't even smoke in here.

264
00:22:08,334 --> 00:22:09,668
No luck?

265
00:22:10,503 --> 00:22:14,590
These aerials don't indicate
a single tunnel in the whole mountainside.

266
00:22:14,591 --> 00:22:16,174
Hm.

267
00:22:16,175 --> 00:22:19,345
Well, the only thing I can see
in all of them is this truck.

268
00:22:21,847 --> 00:22:24,601
- Are you finished with that, honey?
- Yeah.

269
00:22:48,958 --> 00:22:50,502
What happened?

270
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:52,962
Did it stop?

271
00:22:54,631 --> 00:22:55,964
Good morning.

272
00:22:55,965 --> 00:22:57,715
- What's up?
- Are you "The Paisa"?

273
00:22:57,716 --> 00:23:00,718
- Yes.
- Nice to meet you. Javier Peña.

274
00:23:00,719 --> 00:23:03,889
Do me a favor
and get out of the truck.

275
00:23:06,643 --> 00:23:09,646
- What's going on?
- Don't be afraid.

276
00:23:12,106 --> 00:23:14,150
Up against the truck.

277
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:21,824
Let's go.

278
00:23:23,742 --> 00:23:26,077
Do me another favor.

279
00:23:26,078 --> 00:23:27,580
Open it up.

280
00:23:36,464 --> 00:23:37,549
Go on.

281
00:23:46,807 --> 00:23:49,007
We missed a very important delivery.

282
00:23:49,143 --> 00:23:55,483
Sex toys, back issues of Hustler,
a waterbed, a legal correspondence course.

283
00:23:56,192 --> 00:23:58,902
He's bored shitless in there.

284
00:23:58,903 --> 00:24:02,322
Look, gringos...
you don't have the right to do this.

285
00:24:02,323 --> 00:24:04,740
Of course we have the right.

286
00:24:04,741 --> 00:24:10,830
You just press the button in the truck
and we will do the rest, OK?

287
00:24:10,831 --> 00:24:15,835
If the boss finds out that I let you
put cameras in the truck, he'll kill me.

288
00:24:15,836 --> 00:24:16,956
What did he say?

289
00:24:17,129 --> 00:24:19,215
He says if Pablo finds out,
he'll kill him.

290
00:24:20,925 --> 00:24:22,427
Amigo...

291
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,223
Pablo's your boss?

292
00:24:28,224 --> 00:24:30,518
Yeah? Yeah.

293
00:24:40,236 --> 00:24:43,905
I am your boss. Yes?

294
00:24:43,906 --> 00:24:46,575
It's OK, it's OK!
I'll do whatever you say.

295
00:24:46,576 --> 00:24:47,910
Yeah?

296
00:24:54,584 --> 00:24:56,835
Are you OK, friend?

297
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:31,412
Good day.

298
00:25:43,048 --> 00:25:45,925
So what is this?
What am I looking at exactly?

299
00:25:45,926 --> 00:25:49,012
- Club Medellín.
- This was all shipped in to La Catedral.

300
00:25:49,013 --> 00:25:52,308
We got some big-screen TVs,
nice stereo equipment.

301
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:55,644
That's a roulette wheel,
a little bit of liquor.

302
00:25:55,645 --> 00:25:59,357
Glad to see the judges could come down
with the official from the airport.

303
00:25:59,565 --> 00:26:02,193
Javi's pretty keen on this Jacuzzi.

304
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:05,363
Don't forget the jukebox
with the hookers.

305
00:26:05,571 --> 00:26:07,615
Of course, the lobster.

306
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:15,539
- This is a...
- Yes, it's a roulette wheel.

307
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:18,626
He has a casino
right there at La Catedral.

308
00:26:19,627 --> 00:26:23,630
- Where did you get these pictures?
- From the DEA.

309
00:26:23,631 --> 00:26:25,549
Of course.

310
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,551
It's not just these pictures.

311
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:30,387
They also have pictures of judges,
local government people,

312
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:35,351
other narcos, prostitutes...
Even soccer players come to visit Pablo.

313
00:26:37,603 --> 00:26:41,189
- Who else has seen these?
- No one, as far as I know.

314
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:45,569
That's why we have to act now.

315
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:49,656
Do you think the DEA is capable
of leaking the photos to the media?

316
00:26:49,657 --> 00:26:54,412
The DEA is capable of anything.
That's why we have to do something now.

317
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:01,918
At one time, Escobar...
used to own all of Colombia.

318
00:27:03,379 --> 00:27:06,006
Now he's just the owner
of his own prison.

319
00:27:07,924 --> 00:27:12,346
If I had to choose
between prostitutes at La Catedral...

320
00:27:13,222 --> 00:27:15,015
or bombings in the country...

321
00:27:20,897 --> 00:27:24,108
I would be eternally grateful
to these women.

322
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:33,743
Happy birthday, Pablo!

323
00:27:35,369 --> 00:27:38,038
- Watch your step.
- Careful with the little girl!

324
00:27:39,707 --> 00:27:41,208
How are you? Welcome.

325
00:27:42,042 --> 00:27:45,546
- Happy birthday.
- Hello, sweetheart.

326
00:28:09,153 --> 00:28:12,322
They're the ones I hired?
I don't believe you.

327
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:16,576
They are really good, Blackie.
I like them.

328
00:28:16,577 --> 00:28:21,790
Come on, Pablo, tell us...
what are you doing these days? Hm!

329
00:28:21,791 --> 00:28:24,710
- How do you spend your time?
- Aside from missing his family?

330
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:26,253
Oh! Of course.

331
00:28:27,546 --> 00:28:30,131
- He's writing a book.
- Mm!

332
00:28:30,132 --> 00:28:32,134
- Mother.
- What?

333
00:28:32,343 --> 00:28:35,721
Isn't it true?
You are writing a book.

334
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:37,807
Please, Mom.

335
00:28:38,014 --> 00:28:39,558
Well, then, you tell them.

336
00:28:45,022 --> 00:28:48,358
- It's a collection of magazine articles.
- Many articles.

337
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:52,570
- Clippings. It's a book of cartoons.
- Oh, cartoons!

338
00:28:52,571 --> 00:28:55,240
From newspapers and magazines
all over the world.

339
00:28:55,449 --> 00:28:57,910
And you know what?
People write him every day.

340
00:28:58,118 --> 00:29:00,495
- It's because they love him.
- I can imagine.

341
00:29:00,496 --> 00:29:03,624
You have to find ways
to keep your mind occupied around here.

342
00:29:03,833 --> 00:29:08,419
Yes, my love. And you have Judy's husband
and Galeano to help you with the business.

343
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:11,715
Yes, on that note,
Kiko is so grateful to you

344
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:14,175
for all the responsibilities
you have given him.

345
00:29:14,176 --> 00:29:15,678
Thank you very much.

346
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:17,595
- We were in Cartagena...
- Where?

347
00:29:17,596 --> 00:29:19,891
- We were in Cartagena last week.
- Oh, yeah?

348
00:29:20,098 --> 00:29:23,393
Oh, yes, we spent
some beautiful days there relaxing.

349
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:25,274
It must feel good
to be able to relax like that.

350
00:29:25,479 --> 00:29:27,731
- How nice.
- Wonderful, Tata. You can't imagine.

351
00:29:27,732 --> 00:29:30,441
But I'll tell you,
Cartagena is really expensive.

352
00:29:30,442 --> 00:29:33,319
Oh, it's unaffordable.

353
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,823
Besides, this whole "war with Cali" thing,

354
00:29:36,824 --> 00:29:39,993
it's tough, you know,
with the tax we have to pay.

355
00:29:39,994 --> 00:29:44,330
We understand it's not easy,
but there's not much we can do.

356
00:29:44,331 --> 00:29:45,875
It's OK.

357
00:29:53,716 --> 00:29:55,426
Kiko complained about that?

358
00:29:58,178 --> 00:30:00,097
He mentioned it.

359
00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:06,394
He didn't complain, Pablo,
he didn't complain.

360
00:30:06,395 --> 00:30:10,566
Everyone here is absolutely aware
of the huge sacrifice that you're making,

361
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:13,402
for God's sake.
So I think it's normal, right?

362
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:15,291
It's normal that
we'd give you our support.

363
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:18,866
Well, I think it's normal...
I really do.

364
00:30:23,913 --> 00:30:27,248
Juan Pablito, go play with your dad
for a little while, OK?

365
00:30:27,249 --> 00:30:30,086
Honey, you should
play with the kids a little bit.

366
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:37,093
Leave the gift here.

367
00:30:37,843 --> 00:30:39,177
I'll look after it.

368
00:31:00,699 --> 00:31:05,079
The word from Sandoval is, Gaviria isn't
gonna do shit about Escobar's violations.

369
00:31:08,124 --> 00:31:10,417
Carrillo was right. He won.

370
00:31:12,377 --> 00:31:13,796
What are those?

371
00:31:15,297 --> 00:31:18,467
These are a list of, uh...
my accomplishments.

372
00:31:39,237 --> 00:31:40,865
You shred these.

373
00:32:22,031 --> 00:32:23,199
Apologize!

374
00:32:23,448 --> 00:32:24,949
Apologize!

375
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:26,493
Apologize!

376
00:32:27,619 --> 00:32:30,329
- Were you watching?
- Yes.

377
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:31,998
You apologize!

378
00:32:31,999 --> 00:32:33,918
I'm sorry, boss.

379
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:36,837
I didn't mean it.

380
00:32:42,885 --> 00:32:44,552
- Relax.
- Are you all right, boss?

381
00:32:44,553 --> 00:32:46,930
Relax. That's how the game goes.

382
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:49,516
Go on, go on.
You guys continue.

383
00:32:52,644 --> 00:32:54,230
Are you all right, sir?

384
00:32:56,481 --> 00:32:57,691
Boss.

385
00:32:58,525 --> 00:33:01,861
Excuse me, boss,
but I need to speak to you.

386
00:33:01,862 --> 00:33:03,280
Everything OK?

387
00:33:04,823 --> 00:33:08,119
- Boss, we have a problem.
- What problem?

388
00:33:08,326 --> 00:33:11,162
You remember that Moncada and Galeano
had a large shipment

389
00:33:11,163 --> 00:33:14,916
- that was seized in Boyacá?
- Yes.

390
00:33:14,917 --> 00:33:17,961
- 250 kilos.
- Exactly.

391
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:22,339
Can you imagine, a farmer found
three million dollars buried in a field?

392
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,759
Do you know where that was, boss?

393
00:33:25,343 --> 00:33:26,804
In Rionegro.

394
00:33:27,721 --> 00:33:32,810
True story. And pay attention,
because it changes a lot of lives.

395
00:33:34,186 --> 00:33:37,605
Remember how I told you that
the cartel was making so much money

396
00:33:37,606 --> 00:33:39,565
that they had to bury it?

397
00:33:39,566 --> 00:33:41,859
And Blackbeard had the treasure map.

398
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:45,738
Well, after we got him,
he gave a lot of it up...

399
00:33:45,739 --> 00:33:47,657
but not all of it.

400
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:51,661
It just so happens that one day,
out in a field in Rionegro,

401
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:56,373
a farmer who worked
for Galeano and Moncada found one.

402
00:33:56,374 --> 00:33:59,044
At first, the poor guy
thought he'd dug up a body.

403
00:33:59,253 --> 00:34:02,506
Over the years, plenty of 'em
had been buried out in the fields.

404
00:34:03,465 --> 00:34:06,217
The farmer knew right away
it was narco money.

405
00:34:06,218 --> 00:34:10,014
He was terrified he might
get buried himself if he took it.

406
00:34:10,222 --> 00:34:12,932
So he took the money
to a guy who was connected,

407
00:34:12,933 --> 00:34:15,310
who took it to another guy...

408
00:34:15,311 --> 00:34:19,481
who took it to Pablo's
sicario lieutenant... Velasco.

409
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:23,194
There's cash buried everywhere.

410
00:34:24,111 --> 00:34:28,240
The guerillas, the paramilitary,
the narcos...

411
00:34:29,241 --> 00:34:31,910
- Everybody's burying cash.
- Yes, I know.

412
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:35,039
But right on Moncada
and Galeano's property?

413
00:34:36,748 --> 00:34:39,251
Don't you think that's strange, boss?

414
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:42,129
I think it's strange.

415
00:35:10,699 --> 00:35:14,202
Look. All this cash...

416
00:35:14,203 --> 00:35:18,374
was found... in a field.

417
00:35:18,582 --> 00:35:20,959
That's good luck, Pablo.

418
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:26,382
Or it could be bad luck.
For you both.

419
00:35:31,345 --> 00:35:35,724
It was on your property,
in Rionegro.

420
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:39,435
But Pablo,
those lands are over 300 acres,

421
00:35:39,436 --> 00:35:42,564
and most of us rent out to the farmers.

422
00:35:44,482 --> 00:35:45,776
Mm.

423
00:35:47,111 --> 00:35:52,407
You told me that you had
a 250-kilo shipment seized.

424
00:35:52,408 --> 00:35:53,867
That's true.

425
00:35:54,076 --> 00:35:56,245
The shipment equaled that amount of cash.

426
00:35:56,453 --> 00:35:58,705
Who told you to open your mouth?

427
00:35:58,914 --> 00:36:02,126
Not true? Hm?

428
00:36:03,085 --> 00:36:06,421
Pablo, do you think
we're stealing from you?

429
00:36:06,422 --> 00:36:09,340
That we made up that whole story
about the seizure?

430
00:36:09,341 --> 00:36:12,385
If you'd like,
check with the cops in Boyacá.

431
00:36:12,386 --> 00:36:16,765
Right, because cops in Boyacá
are so honest, right?

432
00:36:18,934 --> 00:36:21,937
Keep in mind that
we bought that property from Gustavo.

433
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:28,068
I even remember Gustavo saying
that you had cash stashed in every corner.

434
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:36,034
Gustavo...
would never forget where he buried cash.

435
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:41,790
Who's putting this shit
in your head, Pablo? These assholes?

436
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:44,251
These fuckers
would sell their own mother.

437
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:48,130
- We are partners and friends.
- Mm.

438
00:36:49,673 --> 00:36:54,261
Maybe that cash was lost
because I raised the tax?

439
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:57,513
Bullshit.
I paid the tax and never complained.

440
00:36:57,514 --> 00:36:59,808
That's a lie.

441
00:37:01,768 --> 00:37:05,855
- Because you complained to your wife.
- I haven't complained.

442
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:08,984
You have no idea
what I talk about with Judy.

443
00:37:09,818 --> 00:37:11,861
I understand
this is difficult for you, Pablo...

444
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:13,447
What is difficult for me?

445
00:37:13,655 --> 00:37:17,241
Well, managing all of this.
That's why you hired us.

446
00:37:17,242 --> 00:37:20,204
- So we can manage it and look after it.
- Mm.

447
00:37:23,332 --> 00:37:25,792
You trust us, right?

448
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:29,003
I understand this makes you anxious...

449
00:37:29,004 --> 00:37:31,923
- Do I look anxious?
- No, I didn't mean that.

450
00:37:32,132 --> 00:37:34,800
- You said with certainty that...
- No, no, what I meant to say was...

451
00:37:34,801 --> 00:37:40,057
- I think you're the one who's anxious.
- We didn't do shit, Pablo!

452
00:37:42,017 --> 00:37:47,314
With that tone of yours...
you're telling me you didn't do shit?

453
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:53,404
Like I was some kind of idiot.
Is this my cash or not?!

454
00:37:53,611 --> 00:37:54,611
No, Pablo.

455
00:37:54,612 --> 00:37:58,534
Did you take it and bury it
in Rionegro or not?!

456
00:37:58,742 --> 00:38:00,577
For sure,
these guys hid your cash, boss.

457
00:38:00,785 --> 00:38:03,620
- It's the truth, you pair of liars.
- Of course, he...

458
00:38:03,621 --> 00:38:05,956
- Shut up, motherfucker!
- You're petty thieves!

459
00:38:05,957 --> 00:38:09,836
You shut up, motherfucker!
Don't you disrespect me!

460
00:38:14,341 --> 00:38:16,510
Pablo, look at me, man.

461
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:20,638
We're family.

462
00:38:21,723 --> 00:38:25,601
You're my daughter's godfather.

463
00:38:25,602 --> 00:38:28,897
And also godfather to Galeano's kids.

464
00:38:30,482 --> 00:38:31,649
What's going on?

465
00:38:37,655 --> 00:38:39,616
We're like brothers.

466
00:38:41,034 --> 00:38:44,204
We're partners and friends.

467
00:38:44,413 --> 00:38:47,457
We've been in this
our whole lives, Pablo.

468
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:51,127
We made our first trip to Miami together.

469
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:57,008
We made so much cash together that
we don't even know what we spent it on.

470
00:38:58,093 --> 00:39:00,095
What's the problem?

471
00:39:00,929 --> 00:39:03,223
What's happening?

472
00:39:06,184 --> 00:39:08,936
The two of us love you very much.

473
00:39:08,937 --> 00:39:11,148
And we're very grateful.

474
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:34,546
All right.

475
00:39:36,214 --> 00:39:38,967
Being stuck in here...

476
00:39:40,093 --> 00:39:42,137
can make someone paranoid.

477
00:39:58,736 --> 00:40:01,239
Paisa! Paisa!

478
00:40:03,408 --> 00:40:07,037
Well, man,
these things happen, right?

479
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:11,583
We're here for whatever you need.
Trust us.

480
00:40:11,791 --> 00:40:13,668
I'm going to make a trip to Miami.

481
00:40:13,669 --> 00:40:16,672
I'll bring you a few little things
to keep you entertained, OK?

482
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:20,717
Don Pablo.

483
00:40:50,914 --> 00:40:53,750
Pablo, don't do it! Pablo, no!

484
00:41:17,815 --> 00:41:20,777
You're a dog,
you son of a bitch!

485
00:41:26,241 --> 00:41:30,454
What does it feel like
to take a shit on your own empire?

486
00:41:31,788 --> 00:41:34,207
You want us to tell you
that we stole the money?

487
00:41:38,587 --> 00:41:44,550
At the end of the day, you'll believe
whatever you want, motherfucker.

488
00:41:56,271 --> 00:41:57,814
Goodbye, Kiko.

489
00:42:01,901 --> 00:42:05,696
Kill me if you're such a man,
motherfucker.

490
00:42:05,697 --> 00:42:08,031
Kill me with your own fucking hands!

491
00:42:08,032 --> 00:42:10,368
Who are you talking to, asshole?

492
00:42:13,997 --> 00:42:16,040
Motherfucker!

493
00:42:36,436 --> 00:42:37,688
Wait a second!

494
00:42:37,895 --> 00:42:39,773
Be careful, man.

495
00:42:46,237 --> 00:42:48,865
Look what the dead guy gave me.

496
00:43:03,463 --> 00:43:05,756
What the fuck!
You're going to burn all the meat!

497
00:43:05,757 --> 00:43:08,467
What is wrong with you? Can't you see
I'm doing it to cover the smell?

498
00:43:08,468 --> 00:43:12,763
- Yeah, but let's not burn it all.
- What are we gonna do with all this meat?

499
00:43:12,764 --> 00:43:15,725
- What are you going to do?
- What am I supposed to do?

500
00:43:15,726 --> 00:43:17,477
What?

501
00:43:30,365 --> 00:43:32,534
Boss, are you OK?

502
00:43:34,118 --> 00:43:36,120
Do you need anything, boss?

503
00:43:38,081 --> 00:43:41,084
We're grilling some meat.
Do you want some?

504
00:43:42,335 --> 00:43:44,713
No. I'm not hungry.

505
00:44:12,198 --> 00:44:13,658
Navegante.

506
00:44:14,618 --> 00:44:16,160
Boss.

507
00:44:17,036 --> 00:44:20,623
- Do you want me to wax it?
- No, relax.

508
00:44:20,624 --> 00:44:23,376
This one's my favorite.
I enjoy it.

509
00:44:24,168 --> 00:44:26,922
This is a beautiful car.

510
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:30,467
Anything new on Galeano and Moncada?

511
00:44:32,009 --> 00:44:36,013
Looks like the rumors are true, boss.

512
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:42,395
It's a shame.

513
00:44:45,064 --> 00:44:47,023
I warned them.

514
00:44:47,024 --> 00:44:50,027
As the twig is bent, so grows the tree.

515
00:44:57,034 --> 00:44:59,994
Do you still have that DEA contact?

516
00:44:59,995 --> 00:45:03,666
Javier Peña? Of course.

517
00:45:03,667 --> 00:45:06,628
I want you to contact him
and confirm the rumors.

518
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:10,381
They're just as interested
in screwing Escobar as we are.

519
00:45:12,884 --> 00:45:15,261
I haven't heard from him since yesterday.

520
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:19,264
I've called everyone.
I'm so worried.

521
00:45:19,265 --> 00:45:22,685
Pablo told me
that they left La Catedral.

522
00:45:22,686 --> 00:45:24,688
Just relax, sweetie.

523
00:45:25,563 --> 00:45:27,273
Your husband is fine.

524
00:45:28,441 --> 00:45:30,694
No. No, thank you.

525
00:45:32,946 --> 00:45:37,784
Maybe... they had to go
somewhere else urgently?

526
00:45:37,993 --> 00:45:39,744
Or maybe they left
without saying anything.

527
00:45:39,953 --> 00:45:41,996
The way our men usually do.

528
00:45:41,997 --> 00:45:44,623
Yes, but it's a little strange,
don't you think?

529
00:45:44,624 --> 00:45:49,043
Kiko was very clear that he had
a meeting with Pablo at La Catedral.

530
00:45:49,044 --> 00:45:50,630
He said he would be home later.

531
00:45:50,839 --> 00:45:55,301
We're trying to have another baby.
I think I told you that.

532
00:45:55,510 --> 00:46:00,180
No? We're trying to have another baby,
and the time is right,

533
00:46:00,181 --> 00:46:03,600
so we had a very important date to keep.

534
00:46:03,601 --> 00:46:07,731
Are you sure that Pablo
told you that Kiko left La Catedral?

535
00:46:11,234 --> 00:46:13,945
Are you telling me
that my husband is a liar?

536
00:46:15,279 --> 00:46:17,490
I want my husband back.

537
00:46:20,368 --> 00:46:24,622
If Pablo told Tata that they left...

538
00:46:24,831 --> 00:46:27,000
it's because they left.

539
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:33,213
Listen...
Pablo is your kids' godfather.

540
00:46:33,214 --> 00:46:35,592
He would never hurt them.

541
00:46:47,437 --> 00:46:50,273
Let's talk about Don Pablo Escobar.

542
00:46:52,233 --> 00:46:54,778
There are rumors that
he killed Galeano and Moncada.

543
00:46:57,030 --> 00:46:58,573
Where, in jail?

544
00:47:01,409 --> 00:47:04,078
Yeah, yeah.

545
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:06,038
"In jail."

546
00:47:06,039 --> 00:47:09,042
That doesn't make any sense.
They're partners.

547
00:47:10,043 --> 00:47:15,255
Maybe there is not such thing as sense
with Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria.

548
00:47:15,256 --> 00:47:18,802
Bullshit. Where'd you get it?

549
00:47:19,803 --> 00:47:24,139
The relatives of the men he killed...
are up in arms.

550
00:47:24,348 --> 00:47:28,603
The poor fellows went in,
but they never got out.

551
00:47:31,606 --> 00:47:35,068
I want to ask you gentlemen
a serious question now.

552
00:47:36,527 --> 00:47:38,863
How bad do you want Escobar?

553
00:47:39,948 --> 00:47:42,866
How far are you willing to go
in this matter?

554
00:47:42,867 --> 00:47:45,036
What are you proposing?

555
00:47:45,244 --> 00:47:51,292
Well, we both have access to information
that could benefit the other.

556
00:47:51,501 --> 00:47:53,128
No.

557
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,462
No, we don't trade information.

558
00:47:55,463 --> 00:47:57,464
- Just hold on a second.
- No.

559
00:47:57,465 --> 00:47:59,633
He's an informant, Javi.

560
00:47:59,634 --> 00:48:02,678
Whatever you got cookin', it stinks.
I don't want it.

561
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:05,765
Appreciate the tip. Let's go.

562
00:48:10,311 --> 00:48:13,106
Your partner here...

563
00:48:15,692 --> 00:48:18,028
may need some convincing now.

564
00:48:21,656 --> 00:48:27,328
Moncada and Galeano going
into La Catedral, last stamped 9:20.

565
00:48:29,789 --> 00:48:32,416
Every return from this day forward...

566
00:48:35,086 --> 00:48:37,212
no Moncada, no Galeano.

567
00:48:44,219 --> 00:48:48,558
Personally, we couldn't have cared
less about a couple of dead narcos.

568
00:48:48,766 --> 00:48:52,187
It meant more chaos and confusion
in the Medellín cartel.

569
00:48:53,063 --> 00:48:56,982
But we wanted Escobar out of that
piece of shit excuse for a jail,

570
00:48:56,983 --> 00:49:00,027
in a real prison, not a fortress...

571
00:49:00,028 --> 00:49:02,446
where his enemies could get payback.

572
00:49:03,698 --> 00:49:05,323
You sure?

573
00:49:05,324 --> 00:49:09,204
We can either play politics
or we can do the job.

574
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:13,666
Well, we were never any good
at playing politics anyway.

575
00:49:15,459 --> 00:49:17,087
What do you think?

576
00:49:22,884 --> 00:49:25,762
These photos are worth looking into.

577
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:28,598
And believe me, I'm going to.

578
00:49:34,896 --> 00:49:38,608
If it's true, this is
gonna cause a shit storm, you know?

579
00:49:46,574 --> 00:49:48,534
- Be right back.
- Gracias.

580
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:53,247
Well...

581
00:49:53,248 --> 00:49:55,166
Fuck President Gaviria.

582
00:49:55,374 --> 00:49:57,085
Fuck Noonan.

583
00:49:57,292 --> 00:49:59,336
Fuck La Catedral.

584
00:50:01,256 --> 00:50:03,216
And fuck Pablo.
