4
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,720
On your left.

5
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,190
On your left.

6
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,770
On my left. Got it.

7
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,460
Don't say it. Don't you say it.

8
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,480
- On your left.
- Come on!

9
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,980
Need a medic?

10
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:27,880
I need a new set of lungs.

11
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,350
Dude, you just ran, like,
13 miles in 30 minutes.

12
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:32,680
I guess I got a late start.

13
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,320
Really? You should be
ashamed of yourself.

14
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,920
You should take another lap.

15
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,530
Did you just take it?
I assume you just took it.

16
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,930
What unit you with?

17
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,560
58th Pararescue.

18
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,540
But now I'm working down at the VA.

19
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,600
- Sam Wilson.
- Steve Rogers.

20
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,340
I kind of put that together.

21
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:53,910
Must have freaked you out, coming home
after the whole defrosting thing.

22
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,040
It takes some getting used to.

23
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,810
It's good to meet you, Sam.

24
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,350
It's your bed, right?

25
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,250
What's that?

26
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,780
Your bed, it's too soft.

27
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,750
When I was over there,
I'd sleep on the ground,

28
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,850
use rock for pillows,
like a caveman.

29
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,950
Now I'm home, lying in
my bed, and it's like...

30
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:11,350
Lying on a marshmallow.

31
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,490
Feel like I'm gonna sink
right to the floor.

32
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,830
How long?

33
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,460
Two tours.

34
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,040
You must miss the
good old days, huh?

35
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,070
Well, things aren't so bad.

36
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,670
Food's a lot better. We
used to boil everything.

37
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:26,900
No polio is good.

38
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,440
Internet, so helpful.

39
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,460
I've been reading that a
lot, trying to catch up.

40
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:36,110
Marvin Gaye, 1972,
Trouble Man soundtrack.

41
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,680
Everything you missed
jammed into one album.

42
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,320
I'll put it on the list.

43
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,330
All right, Sam, duty calls.
Thanks for the run.

44
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,730
If that's what you
want to call running.

45
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:53,800
That's how it is?

46
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,380
- That's how it is.
- Okay.

47
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,100
Any time you want to stop by
the VA, make me look awesome

48
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,710
in front of the girl at the
front desk, just let me know.

49
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,720
- I'll keep it in mind.
- Yeah.

50
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,950
Hey, fellas.

51
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,880
Either one of you know
where the Smithsonian is?

52
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,680
I'm here to pick up a fossil.

53
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,230
That's hilarious.

54
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,260
- How you doing?
- Hey.

55
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,530
Can't run everywhere.

56
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,070
No, you can't.

57
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,600
Target is a mobile
satellite launch platform,

58
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,910
the Lemurian Star.

59
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,540
They were sending up their last
payload when pirates took them,

60
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,240
93 minutes ago.

61
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,140
- Any demands?
- Billion and a half.

62
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,280
- Why so steep?
- Because it's S.H.I.E.L.D.'s.

63
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,150
So it's not off-course.
It's trespassing.

64
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,750
I'm sure they have a good reason.

65
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,820
You know, I'm getting a little
tired of being Fury's janitor.

66
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,690
Relax. It's not that complicated.

67
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:54,860
How many pirates?

68
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:58,030
25. Top mercs led by this guy.

69
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,860
Georges Batroc. Ex-DGSE,
Action Division.

70
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,270
He's at the top of
Interpol's Red Notice.

71
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,870
Before the French demobilized
him, he had 36 kill missions.

72
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,840
This guy's got a rep for
maximum casualties.

73
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,040
Hostages?

74
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,420
Mostly techs. One officer.
Jasper Sitwell.

75
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,980
They're in the galley.

76
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,750
What's Sitwell doing
on a launch ship?

77
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,850
All right, I'm gonna sweep
the deck and find Batroc.

78
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,760
Nat, you kill the engines
and wait for instructions.

79
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,390
Rumlow, you sweep aft,
find the hostages,

80
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,220
get them to the life-pods,
get them out. Let's move.

81
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,930
S.T.R.I.K.E., you heard
the Cap. Gear up.

82
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,740
Secure channel seven.

83
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,800
Seven secure.

84
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,740
Did you do anything
fun Saturday night?

85
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:49,240
Well, all the guys from my
barbershop quartet are dead,

86
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,740
so, no, not really.

87
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,280
Coming up on the drop zone, Cap.

88
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,830
You know, if you ask Kristen out, from
Statistics, she'd probably say yes.

89
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,660
That's why I don't ask.

90
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,230
Too shy, or too scared?

91
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,400
Too busy!

92
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,960
Was he wearing a parachute?

93
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,540
No.

94
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,340
No, he wasn't.

95
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,650
Hey!

96
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,590
Don't move.

97
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,590
Don't move.

98
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:10,510
Thanks.

99
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,060
Yeah. You seemed pretty
helpless without me.

100
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,820
What about the nurse that lives
across the hall from you?

101
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,960
She seems kind of nice.

102
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,760
Secure the engine room,
then find me a date.

103
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm multi-tasking.

104
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,260
I told Batroc...

105
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,260
I told Batroc...

106
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,660
If we want to make
S.H.I.E.L.D. pay us...

107
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,660
If we want to make
S.H.I.E.L.D. pay us...

108
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:30,400
We have to start sending
them bodies now!

109
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:30,400
We have to start sending
them bodies now!

110
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,280
I have a bullet for someone...

111
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,280
I have a bullet for someone...

112
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,340
You want a bullet in your head?

113
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,360
Move that foot. You want
a bullet in the head...?

114
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,360
Move that foot. You want
a bullet in the head...?

115
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,370
I don't like waiting.

116
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,370
I don't like waiting.

117
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,490
Call Durand.

118
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,490
Call Durand.

119
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,860
I want this ship ready to
move when the ransom comes.

120
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,860
I want this ship ready to
move when the ransom comes.

121
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,430
Start the engines.

122
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,430
Start the engines.

123
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,040
Okay.

124
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,250
Hey, sailor.

125
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,270
Shut up.

126
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,270
Shut up.

127
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:32,730
You want to be a hero? Is that it?

128
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:32,730
You want to be a hero? Is that it?

129
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:41,480
All right, I've
waited long enough...

130
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:41,480
All right, I've
waited long enough...

131
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,740
Hey!

132
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,840
Find Batroc...

133
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,840
Find Batroc...

134
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,840
If I don't hear anything
in two minutes...

135
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,840
If I don't hear anything
in two minutes...

136
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,280
I'll start killing them!

137
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,280
I'll start killing them!

138
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,860
I'll find him.

139
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,860
I'll find him.

140
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,760
Two minutes.

141
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,760
Two minutes.

142
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,490
Radio silence from
S.H.I.E.L.D., Batroc...

143
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,490
Radio silence from
S.H.I.E.L.D., Batroc...

144
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,970
Targets acquired.

145
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,670
S.T.R.I.K.E. in position.

146
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,880
Natasha, what's your status?

147
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,130
Status, Natasha.

148
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,680
Hang on!

149
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,920
Engine room secure.

150
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,610
Time is up.

151
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,610
Time is up.

152
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:18,540
Who wants to die first...?

153
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:18,540
Who wants to die first...?

154
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,700
You!

155
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,700
You!

156
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,250
Get that one.

157
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,250
Get that one.

158
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:25,720
On my mark.

159
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,170
Three...

160
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,080
Two... One.

161
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:39,350
I told you, S.H.I.E.L.D.
doesn't negotiate.

162
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,360
The line just went dead.

163
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,360
The line just went dead.

164
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,370
I've lost contact with them...

165
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,370
I've lost contact with them...

166
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:02,010
Hostages en route to extraction.

167
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:05,310
Romanoff missed the
rendezvous point, Cap.

168
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,480
Hostiles are still in play.

169
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,920
Natasha, Batroc's on the move.

170
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,500
Circle back to Rumlow and
protect the hostages.

171
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:14,490
Natasha.

172
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,730
I thought you were more
than just a shield...

173
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,730
I thought you were more
than just a shield...

174
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,450
Let's see.

175
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,450
Let's see.

176
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,800
Well, this is awkward.

177
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,070
What are you doing?

178
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:41,410
Backing up the hard drive.

179
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:43,210
It's a good habit to get into.

180
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:44,510
Rumlow needed your help.

181
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,420
What the hell are you doing here?

182
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,780
You're saving S.H.I.E.L.D. intel.

183
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,120
Whatever I can get my hands on.

184
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,720
Our mission is to rescue hostages.

185
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,060
No, that's your mission,

186
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:58,800
and you've done it beautifully.

187
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,490
You just jeopardized
this whole operation.

188
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,230
I think that's overstating things.

189
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,420
Okay.

190
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,290
That one's on me.

191
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,730
You're damn right.

192
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:57,250
You just can't stop yourself
from lying, can you?

193
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,380
I didn't lie.

194
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,850
Agent Romanoff had a different
mission than yours.

195
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,780
Which you didn't feel
obliged to share.

196
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,690
I'm not obliged to do anything.

197
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,220
Those hostages could
have died, Nick.

198
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,990
I sent the greatest soldier in history
to make sure that didn't happen.

199
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:11,330
Soldiers trust each other.
That's what makes it an army.

200
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:13,100
Not a bunch of guys running
around shooting guns.

201
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:16,870
Last time I trusted
someone, I lost an eye.

202
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:20,770
Look, I didn't want you doing anything
you weren't comfortable with.

203
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:23,170
Agent Romanoff is comfortable
with everything.

204
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,610
I can't lead a mission

205
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,540
when the people I'm leading
have missions of their own.

206
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:29,340
It's called compartmentalization.

207
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:32,480
Nobody spills the secrets,
because nobody knows them all.

208
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:34,360
Except you.

209
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,660
You're wrong about me.

210
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,760
I do share.

211
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,470
I'm nice like that.

212
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:48,360
- Insight bay.
- Captain Rogers does not have

213
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,830
clearance for Project Insight.

214
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:52,330
Director override.
Fury, Nicholas J.

215
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:54,350
Confirmed.

216
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,850
You know, they used to play music.

217
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,110
Yeah.

218
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:03,840
My grandfather operated one
of these things for 40 years.

219
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,450
Granddad worked in a nice building.

220
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:08,220
Got good tips.

221
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:12,620
He'd walk home every night, a roll
of ones stuffed in his lunch bag.

222
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,060
He'd say, "Hi."

223
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,360
People would say, "Hi" back.

224
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,230
Time went on, the
neighborhood got rougher.

225
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,770
He'd say, "Hi."

226
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,900
They'd say, "Keep on steppin'."

227
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,530
Granddad got to gripping that
lunch bag a little tighter.

228
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,510
Did he ever get mugged?

229
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,140
Every week some punk would
say, "What's in the bag?"

230
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,010
What would he do?

231
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,710
He'd show them.

232
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:39,760
Bunch of crumpled ones,
and a loaded .22 Magnum.

233
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,550
Yeah, Granddad loved people.

234
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:48,830
But he didn't trust them very much.

235
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,960
Yeah, I know.

236
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,940
They're a little bit
bigger than a .22.

237
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:35,330
This is Project Insight.

238
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,770
Three next-generation helicarriers

239
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:40,610
synced to a network of
targeting satellites.

240
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,570
Launched from the Lemurian Star.

241
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:45,810
Once we get them in the air,
they never need to come down.

242
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:50,680
Continuous sub-orbital flight,
courtesy of our new repulsor engines.

243
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,180
Stark?

244
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,550
He had a few suggestions

245
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:56,290
once he got an up-close
look at our old turbines.

246
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:59,290
These new long-range precision guns

247
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:01,860
can eliminate 1,000
hostiles a minute.

248
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:06,640
The satellites can read a terrorist's DNA
before he steps outside his spider hole.

249
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,670
We're gonna neutralize a lot of
threats before they even happen.

250
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,770
Thought the punishment usually
came after the crime.

251
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,300
We can't afford to wait that long.

252
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,940
Who's "we"?

253
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,440
After New York, I convinced
the World Security Council

254
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,280
we needed a quantum surge
in threat analysis.

255
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:23,210
For once, we're way
ahead of the curve.

256
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:27,030
By holding a gun to everyone on
Earth and calling it protection.

257
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:30,630
You know, I read those SSR files.

258
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,460
"Greatest Generation"?

259
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,660
You guys did some nasty stuff.

260
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,670
Yeah, we compromised.

261
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,900
Sometimes in ways that
made us not sleep so well.

262
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,470
But we did it so that
people could be free.

263
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:43,740
This isn't freedom. This is fear.

264
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:47,410
S.H.I.E.L.D. takes the world as
it is, not as we'd like it to be.

265
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:51,920
And it's getting damn near past time
for you to get with that program, Cap.

266
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,720
Don't hold your breath.

267
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,970
Welcome to the Smithsonian.

268
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:19,100
Visitor information booths are
available on the second level.

269
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:30,320
A symbol to the nation.

270
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,260
A hero to the world.

271
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:40,360
The story of Captain America is one
of honor, bravery and sacrifice.

272
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,560
Denied enlistment
due to poor health,

273
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,900
Steven Rogers was
chosen for a program

274
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,610
unique in the annals
of American warfare.

275
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:59,520
One that would transform him into
the world's first Super-Soldier.

276
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:06,820
In this rare footage,

277
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:09,450
everyone's favorite war
hero, Captain America...

278
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,050
Battle tested,

279
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,490
Captain America

280
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:15,660
and his Howling Commandos
quickly earned their stripes.

281
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,130
Their mission:

282
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:21,230
taking down HYDRA, the Nazi
rogue science division.

283
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,650
Best friends since childhood,

284
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:30,640
Bucky Barnes and Steven
Rogers were inseparable

285
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,020
on both schoolyard and battlefield.

286
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:38,080
Barnes is the only Howling
Commando to give his life

287
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,220
in service of his country.

288
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,590
That was a difficult winter.

289
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:51,400
A blizzard had trapped half our
battalion behind the German line.

290
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,960
Steve, Captain Rogers,

291
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,770
he fought his way through
a HYDRA blockade

292
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:00,940
that had pinned our
allies down for months.

293
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:04,380
He saved over 1,000 men.

294
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,880
Including the man who would...

295
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,260
Who would become my
husband, as it turned out.

296
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,820
Even after he died, Steve
was still changing my life.

297
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,230
You should be proud
of yourself, Peggy.

298
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,800
I have lived a life.

299
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,970
My only regret is that you
didn't get to live yours.

300
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,320
What is it?

301
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:45,350
For as long as I can remember,
I just wanted to do what was right.

302
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:49,260
I guess I'm not quite sure
what that is anymore.

303
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:55,920
And I thought I could throw
myself back in and follow orders.

304
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,030
Serve.

305
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,300
It's just not the same.

306
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,340
You're always so dramatic.

307
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:12,140
Look, you saved the world.

308
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:18,210
We rather mucked it up.

309
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,050
You didn't.

310
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:24,390
Knowing that you helped found
S.H.I.E.L.D. is half the reason I stay.

311
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,260
Hey.

312
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:33,400
The world has changed, and
none of us can go back.

313
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:36,330
All we can do is our best.

314
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:41,140
And sometimes the best that
we can do is to start over.

315
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,550
Peggy.

316
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,360
Steve.

317
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,390
Yeah?

318
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:01,330
You're alive.

319
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:04,660
You came back.

320
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,360
Yeah, Peggy.

321
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:12,100
It's been so long.

322
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:16,110
So long.

323
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,340
Well, I couldn't
leave my best girl.

324
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,940
Not when she owes me a dance.

325
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,250
Secure office.

326
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:40,230
Open Lemurian Star's
satellite launch file.

327
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:42,900
Access denied.

328
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,540
Run decryption.

329
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:48,700
Decryption failed.

330
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,080
Director override.
Fury, Nicholas J.

331
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:56,810
Override denied. All files sealed.

332
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,440
On whose authority?

333
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,180
Fury, Nicholas J.

334
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,520
World Security Council.

335
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,290
Confirmed.

336
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,690
If Nick Fury thinks he can
get his costumed thugs

337
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:17,190
and S.T.R.I.K.E. commandos to mop
up his mess, he's sadly mistaken.

338
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,660
This failure is unacceptable.

339
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,400
Considering this attack took place

340
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,330
one mile from my country's
sovereign waters,

341
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:24,840
it's a bit more than that.
I move for immediate hearing.

342
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,940
We don't need hearings,
we need action.

343
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,410
It's this Council's duty
to oversee S.H.I.E.L.D.

344
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:31,480
A breach like this raises
serious questions.

345
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,410
Like how the hell
did a French pirate

346
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:37,480
manage to hijack a covert S.H.I.E.L.D.
vessel in broad daylight?

347
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,030
For the record, Councilman,
he's Algerian.

348
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,350
I can draw a map if it'd help.

349
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:45,690
I appreciate your wit,
Secretary Pierce.

350
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,130
But this Council takes things like
international piracy fairly seriously.

351
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:52,900
Really? I don't.

352
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,900
I don't care about one boat,
I care about the fleet.

353
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,340
If this Council is going
to fall to rancor

354
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:03,510
every time someone pushes
us on the playing field,

355
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,580
maybe we need someone
to oversee US.

356
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:09,520
Mr. Secretary, nobody
is suggesting...

357
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,250
Excuse me.

358
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:15,950
More trouble, Mr. Secretary?

359
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:18,190
Depends on your definition.

360
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,730
I work 40 floors away and it takes
a hijacking for you to visit?

361
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:32,370
A nuclear war would do it, too.

362
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,370
You busy in there?

363
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:36,310
Nothing some earmarks can't fix.

364
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:41,680
I'm here to ask a favor.

365
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,010
I want you to call for a vote.

366
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:46,620
Project Insight has to be delayed.

367
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,880
Nick, that's not a favor,

368
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:50,720
that's a sub-committee
hearing. Along one.

369
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,520
It could be nothing.
It probably is nothing.

370
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,320
I just need time to
make sure it's nothing.

371
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,590
But if it's something?

372
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:59,900
Then we'll both be damn glad those
helicarriers aren't in the air.

373
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,040
Fine.

374
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:07,170
But you got to get Iron Man to
stop by my niece's birthday party.

375
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:08,770
Thank you, sir.

376
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:12,150
And not just a flyby.
He's got to mingle.

377
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,980
The thing is,

378
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:18,520
I think it's getting worse.

379
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:21,650
A cop pulled me over last week.

380
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:23,490
He thought I was drunk.

381
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:28,290
I swerved to miss a plastic bag.

382
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:31,330
I thought it was an IED.

383
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,400
Some stuff you leave there.

384
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,700
Other stuff you bring back.

385
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,800
It's our job to figure
out how to carry it.

386
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:45,350
Is it gonna be in a big suitcase,
or in a little man-purse?

387
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,620
It's up to you.

388
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,280
- I'll see you next week.
- Definitely.

389
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:54,520
Look who it is, the running man.

390
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,550
Caught the last few minutes.
It's pretty intense.

391
00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:01,070
Yeah, brother, we all
got the same problems.

392
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,760
Guilt,

393
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,530
regret.

394
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:06,700
You lose someone?

395
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,740
My wingman, Riley.

396
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,530
Flying a night mission.

397
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:13,970
Standard PJ rescue op.

398
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:16,240
Nothing we hadn't done
1,000 times before.

399
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,280
Until an RPG knocked Riley's
dumb ass out of the sky.

400
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,840
Nothing I could do.

401
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,390
It's like I was up
there just to watch.

402
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:29,150
- I'm sorry.
- After that,

403
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:33,200
I had a really hard time finding a
reason for being over there, you know?

404
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:37,500
But you're happy now,
back in the world?

405
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:41,730
The number of people giving me
orders is down to about zero.

406
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:43,270
So, hell yeah.

407
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,280
Are you thinking about getting out?

408
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,280
No.

409
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,510
I don't know.

410
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,580
To be honest, I don't know what I
would do with myself if I did.

411
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,290
Ultimate fighting?

412
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:59,010
Just a great idea off
the top of my head.

413
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:02,030
Seriously, you could do
whatever you want to do.

414
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,030
What makes you happy?

415
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:07,590
I don't know.

416
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:11,560
Activating communications
encryption protocol.

417
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,260
Open secure line 0405.

418
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:15,870
Confirmed.

419
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,830
This is Hill.

420
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,900
I need you here in D.C.

421
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:23,280
Deep shadow conditions.

422
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,640
Give me four hours.

423
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,650
You have three. Over.

424
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:44,620
Want to see my lease?

425
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:03,750
Fracture detected.

426
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:09,250
Recommend anesthetic injection.

427
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:17,320
D.C. Metro Police dispatch
shows no units in this area.

428
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,700
Get me out of here.

429
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,330
Propulsion systems offline.

430
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:28,880
Then reboot, damn it!

431
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,750
Warning. Window
integrity compromised.

432
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,930
You think?

433
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,830
How long to propulsion?

434
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,370
Calculating.

435
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:04,470
Window integrity 31%.
Deploying countermeasures.

436
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:06,170
Hold that order!

437
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,710
Window integrity 19%.

438
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:10,670
Offensive measures advised.

439
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:12,620
Wait!

440
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:17,350
Window integrity 1%.

441
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:18,980
Now!

442
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:30,760
Propulsion systems now online.

443
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,310
Full acceleration! Now!

444
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,480
Initiate vertical takeoff!

445
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,610
Flight systems damaged.

446
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:53,060
Then activate guidance cameras!

447
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,330
Give me the wheel!

448
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:05,890
Get me Agent Hill.

449
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,670
Communications array damaged.

450
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:09,030
Well, what's not damaged?

451
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:11,670
Air conditioning is
fully operational.

452
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:24,210
Traffic ahead.

453
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:25,280
Give me an alternate route.

454
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,220
Traffic alert on Roosevelt Bridge.

455
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,720
All vehicles stopped.

456
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,560
17th Avenue clear in three
blocks, directly ahead.

457
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:10,320
Warning. Approaching intersection.

458
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:20,990
Get me off the grid!

459
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:23,370
Calculating route
to secure location.

460
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:41,010
So sweet. That is so nice.

461
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:42,740
Hi.

462
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,290
I got to go, though.

463
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:46,290
Okay. Bye.

464
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:49,250
My aunt, she's kind
of an insomniac.

465
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,930
Yeah.

466
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:54,250
Hey, if you want...

467
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:56,720
If you want, you're welcome
to use my machine.

468
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,700
Might be cheaper than the
one in the basement.

469
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:01,070
Yeah? What's it cost?

470
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:03,700
A cup of coffee?

471
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:08,200
Thank you, but

472
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,030
I already have a
load in downstairs,

473
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:13,070
and you really don't want
my scrubs in your machine.

474
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:16,340
I just finished a rotation in the
infectious disease ward, so...

475
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,540
Well, I'll keep my distance.

476
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,180
Hopefully, not too far.

477
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:24,690
And I think you left
your stereo on.

478
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,480
Right. Thank you.

479
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:29,030
Yeah.

480
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,430
I don't remember giving you a key.

481
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:20,470
You really think I'd need one?

482
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:24,280
My wife kicked me out.

483
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,050
I didn't know you were married.

484
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,680
A lot of things you
don't know about me.

485
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,320
I know, Nick. That's the problem.

486
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:51,510
I'm sorry to have to do this,
but I had no place else to crash.

487
00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:00,290
Who else knows about your wife?

488
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,120
Just...

489
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,120
My friends.

490
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,220
Is that what we are?

491
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,300
That's up to you.

492
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:34,280
Don't trust anyone.

493
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,360
Captain Rogers?

494
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,080
Captain,

495
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,380
I'm Agent 13 of S.H.I.E.L.D.
Special Service.

496
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,960
Kate?

497
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:47,350
I'm assigned to protect you.

498
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,090
On whose order?

499
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,200
His.

500
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,630
Foxtrot is down, he's unresponsive.

501
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:58,870
I need EMTs.

502
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:01,000
Do we have a 20 on the shooter?

503
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:03,010
Tell him I'm in pursuit.

504
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:04,160
Is he gonna make it?

505
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,270
I don't know.

506
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:08,830
Tell me about the shooter.

507
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:11,470
He's fast. Strong.

508
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:15,750
Had a metal arm.

509
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:22,250
Ballistics?

510
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,080
Three slugs, no rifling.
Completely untraceable.

511
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:27,930
Soviet-made.

512
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:29,900
Yeah.

513
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,760
He's in V-tach.

514
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,630
- Crash cart coming in.
- Nurse, help me with the drape.

515
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:35,260
- BP's dropping.
- Defibrillator!

516
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:39,360
I want you to charge him at 100.

517
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:40,870
Don't do this to me, Nick.

518
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:42,470
Stand back.

519
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:43,840
Three, two,

520
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,040
one. Clear.

521
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:48,670
- Pulse?
- No pulse.

522
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:49,740
Okay, 200, please.

523
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,110
Stand back!

524
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:53,540
Three, two, one. Clear!

525
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:55,120
Get me epinephrine!

526
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,810
Pulse?

527
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,360
Negative.

528
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:03,130
Don't do this to me, Nick.
Don't do this to me.

529
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:23,910
What's the time?

530
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:25,510
1:03, Doctor.

531
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,380
Time of death, 1:03 a.m.

532
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:09,460
I need to take him.

533
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:24,570
Natasha.

534
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,390
Natasha!

535
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,320
Why was Fury in your apartment?

536
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:45,190
I don't know.

537
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:47,290
Cap, they want you
back at S.H.I.E.L.D.

538
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,520
Yeah, give me a second.

539
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,070
They want you now.

540
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:52,640
Okay.

541
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,940
You're a terrible liar.

542
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:05,340
S.T.R.I.K.E. team,
escort Captain Rogers

543
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:07,780
back to S.H.I.E.L.D.
immediately for questioning.

544
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,820
I told him.

545
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:18,220
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

546
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:21,230
S.T.R.I.K.E., move it out.

547
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:37,710
Captain Rogers.

548
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:39,510
Neighbor.

549
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,250
Captain.

550
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,810
I'm Alexander Pierce.

551
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:46,550
Sir, it's an honor.

552
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:47,680
The honor's mine, Captain.

553
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,730
My father served in
the 101st. Come on in.

554
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:54,220
That photo was taken five
years after Nick and I met,

555
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,760
when I was at State
Department in Bogota.

556
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,560
E.L.N. rebels took the embassy,

557
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:04,200
and security got me out, but
the rebels took hostages.

558
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,670
Nick was Deputy Chief of the
S.H.I.E.L.D. station there,

559
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:09,070
and he comes to me with a plan.

560
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:11,100
He wants to storm the
building through the sewers.

561
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:14,310
I said, "No, we'll negotiate."

562
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,750
Turned out, the E.L.N. didn't negotiate,
so they put out a kill order.

563
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:20,950
They stormed the basement,
and what do they find?

564
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:22,990
They find it empty.

565
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,790
Nick had ignored my direct order,

566
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:29,530
and carried out an unauthorized
military operation on foreign soil,

567
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:32,190
and saved the lives of a
dozen political officers,

568
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:33,490
including my daughter.

569
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:35,230
So you gave him a promotion.

570
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:37,210
I've never had any
cause to regret it.

571
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,580
Captain, why was Nick in
your apartment last night?

572
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:46,740
I don't know.

573
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:49,280
Did you know it was bugged?

574
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:52,550
I did, because Nick told me.

575
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:55,490
Did he tell you he was
the one who bugged it?

576
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:03,430
I want you to see something.

577
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:05,490
Who hired you, Batroc?

578
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:06,760
Is that live?

579
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:10,740
Yeah, they picked him up last night
in a not-so-safe house in Algiers.

580
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:14,830
Are you saying he's a suspect?
Assassination isn't Batroc's line.

581
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:17,740
No, no. It's more
complicated than that.

582
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:20,470
Batroc was hired anonymously
to attack the Lemurian Star.

583
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:24,420
And he was contacted by email
and paid by wire transfer,

584
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:29,120
and then the money was run
through 17 fictitious accounts.

585
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:31,150
The last one going
to a holding company

586
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:33,650
that was registered
to a Jacob Veech.

587
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:35,050
Am I supposed to know who that is?

588
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:37,560
Not likely. Veech
died six years ago.

589
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:40,760
His last address was
1435 Elmhurst Drive.

590
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:44,800
When I first met Nick,
his mother lived at 1437.

591
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:49,630
Are you saying Fury
hired the pirates? Why?

592
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,980
The prevailing theory

593
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:55,510
was that the hijacking was
a cover for the acquisition

594
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:58,310
and sale of classified
intelligence.

595
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:03,020
The sale went sour and
that led to Nick's death.

596
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:08,960
If you really knew Nick Fury,
you'd know that's not true.

597
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,360
Why do you think we're talking?

598
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:18,100
See, I took a seat on the Council
not because I wanted to,

599
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:22,340
but because Nick asked me to,
because we were both realists.

600
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:28,280
We knew that, despite all the diplomacy
and the handshaking and the rhetoric,

601
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:31,310
to build a really better world

602
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:35,220
sometimes means having to
tear the old one down.

603
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:38,990
And that makes enemies.

604
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:43,750
Those people that call you
dirty because you got the guts

605
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:47,200
to stick your hands in the mud and
try to build something better.

606
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:51,300
And the idea that those
people could be happy today

607
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:55,140
makes me really, really angry.

608
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:00,870
Captain, you were the last
one to see Nick alive.

609
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:03,420
I don't think that's an accident.

610
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:05,590
And I don't think you do, either.

611
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:09,550
So, I'm gonna ask again.

612
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:11,890
Why was he there?

613
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:17,130
He told me not to trust anyone.

614
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,530
I wonder if that included him.

615
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,300
I'm sorry.

616
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,140
Those were his last words.

617
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:31,940
Excuse me.

618
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:36,540
Captain,

619
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:40,090
somebody murdered my friend
and I'm gonna find out why.

620
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:43,420
Anyone gets in my way,
they're gonna regret it.

621
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:46,320
Anyone.

622
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:50,590
Understood.

623
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:09,240
Operations Control.

624
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,220
Confirmed.

625
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:14,340
Keep all S.T.R.I.K.E.
personnel on site.

626
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:15,780
- Understood.
- Yes, sir.

627
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:17,250
- Forensics.
- Confirmed.

628
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:18,710
Cap.

629
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:20,260
Rumlow.

630
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:32,390
Evidence Response found some fibers
on the roof they want us to see.

631
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:34,100
You want me to get
the tac team ready?

632
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:35,800
No, let's wait and see
what it is first.

633
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,400
Right.

634
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:51,050
What's the status so far?

635
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:53,850
- Administrations level.
- Confirmed.

636
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:55,830
Excuse me.

637
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:05,990
I'm sorry about what
happened with Fury.

638
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:08,200
It's messed up, what
happened to him.

639
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,140
Thank you.

640
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:29,620
Records.

641
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:31,250
Confirmed.

642
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:49,110
Before we get started,

643
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,780
does anyone want to get out?

644
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:27,640
Mobilize S.T.R.I.K.E.
units, 25th floor.

645
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:44,260
Whoa, big guy.

646
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:48,200
I just want you to know,
Cap, this isn't personal!

647
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:01,080
It kind of feels personal.

648
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:12,090
Drop the shield and put
your hands in the air!

649
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:31,070
Give it up, Rogers!
Get that door open!

650
00:49:31,070 --> 00:49:33,120
You have nowhere to go!

651
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:53,590
Are you kidding me?

652
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:56,300
He's headed for the garage.
Lock down the bridge.

653
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:10,610
Stand down, Captain
Rogers. Stand down.

654
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:13,350
Repeat, stand down.

655
00:50:49,450 --> 00:50:51,380
Eyes here.

656
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:53,450
Whatever your op is, bury it.

657
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:54,950
This is Level One.

658
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:56,820
Contact DOT.

659
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:58,850
All traffic lights in
the district go red.

660
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:01,490
Shut all runways at BWI,

661
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:03,330
IAD and Reagan.

662
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:06,370
All security cameras in the city go
through this monitor right here.

663
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:08,730
Scan all open sources,

664
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:10,530
phones, computers,

665
00:51:10,530 --> 00:51:12,170
PDAs. Whatever.

666
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:13,940
If someone tweets about this guy,

667
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:15,510
I want to know about it.

668
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,570
With all due respect, if
S.H.I.E.L.D. is conducting

669
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:20,740
a manhunt for Captain America
we deserve to know why.

670
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:22,690
Because he lied to us.

671
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:27,780
Captain Rogers has information
regarding the death of Director Fury.

672
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:29,950
He refused to share it.

673
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,160
As difficult as this is to accept,

674
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:37,430
Captain America is a
fugitive from S.H.I.E.L.D.

675
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:05,650
- Where is it?
- Safe.

676
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:07,650
- Do better.
- Where did you get it?

677
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:09,020
Why would I tell you?

678
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:11,290
Fury gave it to you. Why?

679
00:52:11,290 --> 00:52:12,830
- What's on it?
- I don't know.

680
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:14,060
Stop lying.

681
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:16,110
I only act like I know
everything, Rogers.

682
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:19,070
I bet you knew Fury hired
the pirates, didn't you?

683
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:23,100
Well, it makes sense. The ship was
dirty, Fury needed a way in, so do you.

684
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:24,910
I'm not gonna ask you again.

685
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:27,980
I know who killed Fury.

686
00:52:31,450 --> 00:52:34,050
Most of the intelligence community
doesn't believe he exists.

687
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:37,080
The ones that do call
him the Winter Soldier.

688
00:52:37,090 --> 00:52:39,320
He's credited with over
two dozen assassinations

689
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:41,720
in the last 50 years.

690
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:43,660
So he's a ghost story.

691
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:46,730
Five years ago, I was escorting
a nuclear engineer out of Iran.

692
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:49,330
Somebody shot out my
tires near Odessa.

693
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:51,700
We lost control, went
straight over a cliff.

694
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:53,300
I pulled us out.

695
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:55,680
But the Winter Soldier was there.

696
00:52:55,870 --> 00:52:58,570
I was covering my
engineer so he shot him

697
00:52:58,570 --> 00:53:00,150
straight through me.

698
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:02,020
Soviet slug.

699
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:05,280
No rifling. Bye-bye, bikinis.

700
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:08,560
Yeah, I bet you look
terrible in them now.

701
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,850
Going after him is a dead end.
I know, I've tried.

702
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:17,370
Like you said, he's a ghost story.

703
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:23,760
Well, let's find out
what the ghost wants.

704
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,280
Nick Fury was murdered
in cold blood.

705
00:53:26,330 --> 00:53:27,730
To any reasonable person,

706
00:53:27,730 --> 00:53:30,570
that would make him a
martyr, not a traitor.

707
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:32,040
You know what makes him a traitor?

708
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:34,710
Hiring a mercenary to
hijack his own ship.

709
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:37,110
Nick Fury used your friendship

710
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:40,380
to coerce this Council into
delaying Project Insight.

711
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:42,950
A project he knew would expose
his own illegal operations.

712
00:53:42,950 --> 00:53:46,020
At best, he lied to you.
At worst...

713
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:48,620
Are you calling for my resignation?

714
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:50,120
I've got a pen and
paper right here.

715
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:53,290
That discussion can be
tabled for a later time.

716
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:55,690
But you do want to
have a discussion?

717
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:58,100
We've already had
it, Mr. Secretary.

718
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:03,470
This Council moves to immediately
reactivate Project Insight.

719
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:08,250
If you want to say something
snappy, now would be a good time.

720
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:17,560
First rule of going on the
run is don't run, walk.

721
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:20,660
If I run in these shoes,
they're gonna fall off.

722
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:25,690
The drive has a Level Six homing
program, so as soon as we boot up

723
00:54:25,690 --> 00:54:27,660
S.H.I.E.L.D. will know
exactly where we are.

724
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:29,260
How much time will we have?

725
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:32,070
About nine minutes from

726
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:34,670
now.

727
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,340
Fury was right about that ship.

728
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:43,710
Somebody's trying
to hide something.

729
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:45,680
This drive is protected
by some sort of AI.

730
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:48,410
It keeps rewriting itself
to counter my commands.

731
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:50,420
Can you override it?

732
00:54:50,650 --> 00:54:53,350
The person who developed this
is slightly smarter than me.

733
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:55,120
Slightly.

734
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:07,140
I'm gonna try running a tracer.

735
00:55:07,730 --> 00:55:09,500
This is a program that
S.H.I.E.L.D. developed

736
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:10,970
to track hostile malware,

737
00:55:10,970 --> 00:55:13,970
so if we can't read the file,

738
00:55:13,970 --> 00:55:16,180
maybe we can find out
where it came from.

739
00:55:16,210 --> 00:55:17,720
Can I help you guys with anything?

740
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:21,680
No. My fiancé was just helping me
with some honeymoon destinations.

741
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,850
Right. We're getting married.

742
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:26,220
Congratulations. Where are you
guys thinking about going?

743
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:29,720
New Jersey.

744
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:36,230
I have the exact same glasses.

745
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,700
Wow, you two are practically twins.

746
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:40,540
Yeah, I wish.

747
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,140
Specimen.

748
00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:44,400
If you guys need anything,
I've been Aaron.

749
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:45,950
Thank you.

750
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:50,720
- You said nine minutes. Come on.
- Relax.

751
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:53,120
Got it.

752
00:55:56,650 --> 00:55:57,850
You know it?

753
00:55:57,850 --> 00:56:00,020
I used to. Let's go.

754
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:02,990
Standard tac team.

755
00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:04,650
Two behind, two across,

756
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:06,360
and two coming straight at us.

757
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:09,260
If they make us, I'll engage, you hit
the south escalator to the metro.

758
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:11,390
Shut up and put your arm around me.
Laugh at something I said.

759
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,200
- What?
- Do it.

760
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:22,040
Negative at the source.

761
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:23,580
Give me a floor rundown.

762
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:25,170
Negative on three.

763
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:26,580
Negative on two.

764
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:29,180
Snake the upper levels.
Work down to me.

765
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:37,920
- Kiss me.
- What?

766
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,160
Public displays of affection make
people very uncomfortable.

767
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:41,860
Yes, they do.

768
00:56:50,670 --> 00:56:52,900
You still uncomfortable?

769
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:55,250
It's not exactly the
word I would use.

770
00:57:03,850 --> 00:57:06,550
Where did Captain America
learn how to steal a car?

771
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:08,920
Nazi Germany.

772
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:11,500
And we're borrowing.
Take your feet off the dash.

773
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:18,960
All right, I have a question for you,
which you do not have to answer.

774
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,490
I feel like, if you
don't answer it though,

775
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:21,960
- you're kind of answering it, you know.
- What?

776
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:24,970
Was that your first
kiss since 1945?

777
00:57:24,970 --> 00:57:26,770
- That bad, huh?
- I didn't say that.

778
00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:28,400
Well, it kind of sounds like
that's what you're saying.

779
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,600
No, I didn't.

780
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,740
I just wondered how much
practice you've had.

781
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:33,540
- You don't need practice.
- Everybody needs practice.

782
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:36,080
It was not my first
kiss since 1945.

783
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:38,250
I'm 95, I'm not dead.

784
00:57:38,450 --> 00:57:40,420
Nobody special, though?

785
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:43,380
Believe it or not,
it's kind of hard

786
00:57:43,390 --> 00:57:45,620
to find someone with
shared life experience.

787
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:47,660
Well, that's all right.
You just make something up.

788
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:49,820
- What, like you?
- I don't know.

789
00:57:49,830 --> 00:57:51,160
The truth is a matter
of circumstance.

790
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:54,100
It's not all things to all
people, all the time.

791
00:57:54,730 --> 00:57:56,310
Neither am I.

792
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:58,300
That's a tough way to live.

793
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,600
It's a good way not to die, though.

794
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,770
You know, it's kind of
hard to trust someone,

795
00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:05,710
when you don't know who
that someone really is.

796
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:07,820
Yeah.

797
00:58:10,610 --> 00:58:12,210
Who do you want me to be?

798
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:14,190
How about a friend?

799
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:21,620
Well, there's a chance you might
be in the wrong business, Rogers.

800
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:38,810
This is it.

801
00:58:39,570 --> 00:58:42,020
The file came from
these coordinates.

802
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:44,250
So did I.

803
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:54,190
This camp is where I was trained.

804
00:58:56,690 --> 00:58:58,320
Change much?

805
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:01,730
A little.

806
00:59:01,730 --> 00:59:04,130
Pick up the pace, ladies!

807
00:59:04,130 --> 00:59:06,180
Let's go! Let's go!

808
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:08,230
Double time!

809
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:11,680
Come on, Rogers, move it!

810
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:17,080
Come on, fall in!

811
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:19,010
Rogers!

812
00:59:19,010 --> 00:59:20,780
I said fall in!

813
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:23,880
This is a dead end.

814
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:27,330
Zero heat signatures,
zero waves, not even radio.

815
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:31,460
Whoever wrote the file must have
used a router to throw people off.

816
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:34,130
What is it?

817
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:36,130
Army regulations forbid
storing munitions

818
00:59:36,130 --> 00:59:38,540
within 500 yards of the barracks.

819
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:41,340
This building is in
the wrong place.

820
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:58,620
This is S.H.I.E.L.D.

821
00:59:58,950 --> 01:00:01,360
Maybe where it started.

822
01:00:18,970 --> 01:00:21,310
And there's Stark's father.

823
01:00:21,370 --> 01:00:23,320
Howard.

824
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:25,780
Who's the girl?

825
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:47,430
If you're already working
in a secret office,

826
01:00:57,580 --> 01:00:59,620
why do you need to
hide the elevator?

827
01:01:50,930 --> 01:01:55,340
This can't be the data point.
This technology is ancient.

828
01:02:24,590 --> 01:02:27,330
Y-E-S spells yes.

829
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:33,300
Shall we play a game?

830
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:36,310
- It's from a movie that was really...
- I know, I saw it.

831
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:44,360
Rogers, Steven,

832
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:47,220
born 1918.

833
01:02:49,690 --> 01:02:52,590
Romanoff, Natalia Alianovna,

834
01:02:52,590 --> 01:02:54,660
born 1984.

835
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:56,290
It's some kind of recording.

836
01:02:56,290 --> 01:02:59,270
I am not a recording, Fraulein.

837
01:02:59,290 --> 01:03:01,330
I may not be the man I was

838
01:03:01,330 --> 01:03:04,930
when the Captain took
me prisoner in 1945.

839
01:03:04,930 --> 01:03:07,170
But I am.

840
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:10,310
You know this thing?

841
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:16,710
Arnim Zola was a German scientist
who worked for the Red Skull.

842
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:17,810
He's been dead for years.

843
01:03:17,810 --> 01:03:20,680
First correction, I am Swiss.

844
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:23,150
Second, look around you.

845
01:03:23,150 --> 01:03:26,160
I have never been more alive.

846
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:30,760
In 1972, I received a
terminal diagnosis.

847
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:33,790
Science could not save my body.

848
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:38,200
My mind, however,
that was worth saving,

849
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:42,140
on 200,000 feet of databanks.

850
01:03:42,140 --> 01:03:45,870
You are standing in my brain.

851
01:03:45,870 --> 01:03:48,650
- How did you get here?
- Invited.

852
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:51,210
It was Operation Paperclip
after World War II.

853
01:03:51,210 --> 01:03:55,010
S.H.I.E.L.D. recruited German
scientists with strategic value.

854
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:57,420
They thought I could
help their cause.

855
01:03:57,420 --> 01:03:59,490
I also helped my own.

856
01:03:59,490 --> 01:04:01,120
HYDRA died With the Red Skull.

857
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:05,490
Cut off one head, two more
shall take its place.

858
01:04:05,490 --> 01:04:07,330
Prove it.

859
01:04:08,230 --> 01:04:10,640
Accessing archive.

860
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:14,200
HYDRA was founded on the
belief that humanity

861
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:17,640
could not be trusted
with its own freedom.

862
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:20,470
What we did not realize
was that if you try

863
01:04:20,470 --> 01:04:23,780
to take that freedom, they resist.

864
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:26,250
The war taught us much.

865
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:30,120
Humanity needed to surrender
its freedom willingly.

866
01:04:30,620 --> 01:04:33,720
After the war, S.H.I.E.L.D.
was founded,

867
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:36,150
and I was recruited.

868
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:38,390
The new HYDRA grew.

869
01:04:38,390 --> 01:04:43,030
A beautiful parasite
inside S.H.I.E.L.D.

870
01:04:43,030 --> 01:04:44,830
For 70 years,

871
01:04:44,830 --> 01:04:50,600
HYDRA has been secretly
feeding crisis, reaping war,

872
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:53,950
and when history did not cooperate,

873
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:56,210
history was changed.

874
01:04:56,210 --> 01:04:58,540
That's impossible. S.H.I.E.L.D.
would have stopped you.

875
01:04:58,540 --> 01:05:01,350
Accidents will happen.

876
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:05,920
HYDRA created a world so chaotic

877
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:10,120
that humanity is finally ready
to sacrifice its freedom

878
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:12,670
to gain its security.

879
01:05:12,890 --> 01:05:16,590
Once a purification
process is complete,

880
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:20,610
HYDRA's new world order will arise.

881
01:05:20,970 --> 01:05:23,070
We won, Captain.

882
01:05:23,070 --> 01:05:27,070
Your death amounts to
the same as your life.

883
01:05:27,070 --> 01:05:28,650
A zero sum.

884
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:34,260
As I was saying...

885
01:05:34,550 --> 01:05:35,680
What's on this drive?

886
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:39,490
Project Insight requires insight.

887
01:05:39,550 --> 01:05:42,450
So, I wrote an algorithm.

888
01:05:42,450 --> 01:05:43,690
What kind of algorithm?
What does it do?

889
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:46,620
The answer to your
question is fascinating.

890
01:05:46,620 --> 01:05:51,230
Unfortunately, you shall
be too dead to hear it.

891
01:05:56,730 --> 01:05:58,540
Steve, we got a bogey.

892
01:05:58,570 --> 01:06:00,400
Short range ballistic.

893
01:06:00,410 --> 01:06:02,110
- 30 seconds tops.
- Who fired it?

894
01:06:02,110 --> 01:06:03,270
S.H.I.E.L.D.

895
01:06:03,270 --> 01:06:07,520
I am afraid I have been
stalling, Captain.

896
01:06:07,650 --> 01:06:08,750
Admit it.

897
01:06:08,750 --> 01:06:11,280
It's better this way.

898
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:13,260
We are, both of us,

899
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:15,760
out of time.

900
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:40,680
Call in the asset.

901
01:07:56,450 --> 01:07:58,260
I'm going to go, Mr. Pierce.

902
01:07:58,350 --> 01:08:00,660
You need anything before I leave?

903
01:08:00,820 --> 01:08:04,730
No... It's fine, Renata,
you can go home.

904
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:06,630
Okay. Night-night.

905
01:08:06,630 --> 01:08:08,970
Good night.

906
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:15,410
Want some milk?

907
01:08:24,650 --> 01:08:26,990
The timetable has moved.

908
01:08:28,650 --> 01:08:30,850
Our window is limited.

909
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,990
Two targets, Level Six.

910
01:08:37,830 --> 01:08:40,360
They already cost me Zola.

911
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:43,130
I want confirmed death in 10 hours.

912
01:08:44,570 --> 01:08:47,070
Sorry, Mr. Pierce, I...

913
01:08:47,070 --> 01:08:48,670
I forgot my

914
01:08:48,670 --> 01:08:50,180
phone.

915
01:08:54,710 --> 01:08:58,350
Renata, I wish you
would have knocked.

916
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:23,700
Hey, man.

917
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:27,440
I'm sorry about this. We
need a place to lay low.

918
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:29,450
Everyone we know is
trying to kill us.

919
01:09:31,910 --> 01:09:34,050
Not everyone.

920
01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:52,600
- You okay?
- Yeah.

921
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:03,140
What's going on?

922
01:10:05,710 --> 01:10:09,760
When I first joined S.H.I.E.L.D.
I thought I was going straight.

923
01:10:12,990 --> 01:10:16,430
But I guess I just traded
in the KGB for HYDRA.

924
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:24,400
I thought I knew whose
lies I was telling,

925
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:31,040
but I guess I can't tell
the difference anymore.

926
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:33,980
There's a chance you might
be in the wrong business.

927
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:40,260
I owe you.

928
01:10:41,380 --> 01:10:42,910
It's okay.

929
01:10:42,910 --> 01:10:45,690
If it was the other way around,

930
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:48,020
and it was down to me
to save your life,

931
01:10:48,020 --> 01:10:50,190
now you be honest with me,

932
01:10:51,660 --> 01:10:54,240
would you trust me to do it?

933
01:10:55,730 --> 01:10:57,270
I would now.

934
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,170
And I'm always honest.

935
01:11:02,830 --> 01:11:04,240
Well, you seem pretty chipper

936
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:06,420
for someone who just found
out they died for nothing.

937
01:11:06,810 --> 01:11:11,110
Well, guess I just like
to know who I'm fighting.

938
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:12,990
I made breakfast.

939
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:16,490
If you guys eat that sort of thing.

940
01:11:17,650 --> 01:11:19,120
So, the question is,

941
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:21,630
who at S.H.I.E.L.D. could launch
a domestic missile strike?

942
01:11:23,190 --> 01:11:24,550
Pierce.

943
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:27,320
Who happens to be sitting on top of the
most secure building in the world.

944
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:28,760
But he's not working alone.

945
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:31,400
Zola's algorithm was
on the Lemurian Star.

946
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:34,200
So was Jasper Sitwell.

947
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:39,670
So, the real question is, how
do the two most wanted people

948
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:43,180
in Washington kidnap a S.H.I.E.L.D.
officer in broad daylight?

949
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:46,020
The answer is, you don't.

950
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:48,650
- What's this?
- Call it a résumé.

951
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:53,620
Is this Bakhmala?

952
01:11:53,620 --> 01:11:55,420
The Khalid Khandil
mission, that was you?

953
01:11:56,620 --> 01:11:58,600
You didn't say he was a Pararescue.

954
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:02,190
- Is this Riley?
- Yeah.

955
01:12:02,190 --> 01:12:04,830
I heard they couldn't bring in the
choppers because of the RPGs.

956
01:12:04,830 --> 01:12:05,860
What did you use? A stealth chute?

957
01:12:05,860 --> 01:12:07,440
No.

958
01:12:07,630 --> 01:12:09,680
These.

959
01:12:14,070 --> 01:12:15,740
I thought you said
you were a pilot.

960
01:12:15,740 --> 01:12:17,480
I never said pilot.

961
01:12:20,980 --> 01:12:23,180
I can't ask you to do this, Sam.

962
01:12:23,450 --> 01:12:24,950
You got out for a good reason.

963
01:12:24,950 --> 01:12:26,620
Dude, Captain America
needs my help.

964
01:12:26,620 --> 01:12:28,790
There's no better
reason to get back in.

965
01:12:31,990 --> 01:12:33,820
Where can we get our hands
on one of these things?

966
01:12:33,820 --> 01:12:35,530
The last one is at Fort Meade.

967
01:12:36,030 --> 01:12:39,160
Behind three guarded gates
and a 12-inch steel wall.

968
01:12:41,660 --> 01:12:43,170
Shouldn't be a problem.

969
01:12:44,270 --> 01:12:46,230
Listen, I got to fly home tonight

970
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:49,240
because I got some
constituency problem

971
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:51,340
and I got to press the flesh.

972
01:12:51,340 --> 01:12:54,140
Any constituent in
particular, Mr. Senator?

973
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:56,190
No, not really.

974
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:59,020
Twenty-three, kind of hot.

975
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:00,480
Real hot, you know?

976
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:02,680
Wants to be a reporter,
I think. I don't know.

977
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:03,920
Who listens at that point?

978
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:05,720
Doesn't sound like much
of a problem to me.

979
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:08,320
Really? Because she's
killing my back.

980
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,730
But this isn't the place
to talk about it.

981
01:13:10,730 --> 01:13:12,300
This is a nice pin.

982
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:15,700
- Thank you.
- Come here.

983
01:13:16,030 --> 01:13:17,970
Hail HYDRA.

984
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:22,980
- See, it's right there...
- Yeah, I just saw that.

985
01:13:23,340 --> 01:13:25,320
- Should I get it checked?
- I think you should.

986
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:34,920
I need a minute.

987
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:37,260
Bring the car around.

988
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:41,560
Yes, sir?

989
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:43,390
Agent Sitwell, how was lunch?

990
01:13:43,390 --> 01:13:46,060
I hear the crab cakes
here are delicious.

991
01:13:46,060 --> 01:13:47,290
Who is this?

992
01:13:47,290 --> 01:13:50,430
The good-looking guy in the
sunglasses, your 10 o'clock.

993
01:13:52,070 --> 01:13:53,700
Your other 10 o'clock.

994
01:13:55,070 --> 01:13:56,610
There you go.

995
01:13:58,870 --> 01:14:00,740
What do you want?

996
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:02,740
You're gonna go around the
corner to your right.

997
01:14:02,740 --> 01:14:05,380
There's a gray car two spaces down.

998
01:14:05,380 --> 01:14:07,410
You and I are gonna take a ride.

999
01:14:07,420 --> 01:14:09,320
And why would I do that?

1000
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:12,330
Because that tie looks
really expensive,

1001
01:14:12,350 --> 01:14:14,860
and I'd hate to mess it up.

1002
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:25,600
Tell me about Zola's algorithm.

1003
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:27,330
Never heard of it.

1004
01:14:27,330 --> 01:14:28,470
What were you doing
on the Lemurian Star?

1005
01:14:28,470 --> 01:14:30,610
I was throwing up. I get seasick.

1006
01:14:35,310 --> 01:14:39,120
Is this little display meant to insinuate
that you're gonna throw me off the roof?

1007
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:41,550
Because it's really not
your style, Rogers.

1008
01:14:42,350 --> 01:14:43,890
You're right.

1009
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:45,650
It's not.

1010
01:14:45,650 --> 01:14:47,200
It's hers.

1011
01:14:50,590 --> 01:14:53,690
Wait. What about that girl
from Accounting, Laura...

1012
01:14:53,690 --> 01:14:55,630
Lillian. Lip piercing, right?

1013
01:14:55,630 --> 01:14:56,960
Yeah, she's cute.

1014
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:59,100
Yeah. I'm not ready for that.

1015
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:13,020
Zola's algorithm is a program

1016
01:15:14,110 --> 01:15:15,480
for choosing

1017
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:17,380
- Insight's targets.
- What targets?

1018
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:18,980
You!

1019
01:15:19,450 --> 01:15:21,950
A TV anchor in Cairo, the
Under Secretary of Defense,

1020
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:24,760
a high school Valedictorian
in Iowa City,

1021
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:26,990
Bruce Banner, Stephen Strange,
anyone who's a threat

1022
01:15:26,990 --> 01:15:28,690
to HYDRA.

1023
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:30,800
Now, or in the future.

1024
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:33,210
In the future? How could it know?

1025
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:37,780
How could it not?

1026
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:43,350
The 21st century is a digital book.

1027
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:46,350
Zola taught HYDRA how to read it.

1028
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:50,380
Your bank records,

1029
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:51,920
medical histories, voting patterns,

1030
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:54,930
emails, phone calls,
your damn SAT scores!

1031
01:15:55,850 --> 01:15:59,800
Zola's algorithm
evaluates people's past

1032
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:01,590
to predict their future.

1033
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:03,190
And what then?

1034
01:16:06,130 --> 01:16:08,030
Oh, my God. Pierce
is gonna kill me.

1035
01:16:08,030 --> 01:16:10,200
What then?

1036
01:16:12,170 --> 01:16:15,770
Then the Insight helicarriers
scratch people off the list.

1037
01:16:17,580 --> 01:16:19,920
A few million at a time.

1038
01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:28,250
HYDRA doesn't like leaks.

1039
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:30,120
Then why don't you try
sticking a cork in it?

1040
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:31,660
Insight's launching in 16 hours.

1041
01:16:31,660 --> 01:16:32,760
We're cutting it a
little bit close here.

1042
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:34,860
I know. We'll use him
to bypass the DNA scans

1043
01:16:34,860 --> 01:16:36,590
and access the
helicarriers directly.

1044
01:16:36,590 --> 01:16:38,170
What? Are you crazy?

1045
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:40,700
That is a terrible, terrible idea.

1046
01:17:23,870 --> 01:17:25,650
Shit!

1047
01:17:36,550 --> 01:17:38,360
Hang on!

1048
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:21,760
I have her. Find him.

1049
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:21,760
I have her. Find him.

1050
01:20:26,550 --> 01:20:28,100
Go! I got this!

1051
01:21:07,630 --> 01:21:09,460
Taking fire above and
below expressway.

1052
01:21:09,460 --> 01:21:12,300
Civilians threatened. Repeat,
civilians threatened.

1053
01:21:15,970 --> 01:21:18,870
I make an LZ, 2300 block
of Virginia Avenue.

1054
01:21:18,870 --> 01:21:20,470
Rendezvous, two minutes.

1055
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:46,930
Get out of the way!

1056
01:21:46,930 --> 01:21:49,170
Stay out of the way!

1057
01:23:35,740 --> 01:23:37,310
Bucky?

1058
01:23:37,310 --> 01:23:39,320
Who the hell is Bucky?

1059
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:09,070
Drop the shield, Cap!
Get on your knees!

1060
01:24:09,070 --> 01:24:10,600
Get on your knees!

1061
01:24:10,610 --> 01:24:13,410
Get down, get down!
Get on your knees!

1062
01:24:13,410 --> 01:24:15,010
Down!

1063
01:24:15,010 --> 01:24:16,550
Don't move.

1064
01:24:23,020 --> 01:24:24,590
Put the gun down.

1065
01:24:24,590 --> 01:24:27,030
Not here. Not here!

1066
01:24:41,940 --> 01:24:43,510
It was him.

1067
01:24:46,310 --> 01:24:50,220
He looked right at me like
he didn't even know me.

1068
01:24:50,340 --> 01:24:53,210
How is that even possible?
It was, like, 70 years ago.

1069
01:24:53,210 --> 01:24:54,680
Zola.

1070
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:56,450
Bucky's whole unit
was captured in '43.

1071
01:24:56,450 --> 01:24:58,550
Zola experimented on him.

1072
01:24:58,550 --> 01:25:01,260
Whatever he did helped
Bucky survive the fall.

1073
01:25:02,590 --> 01:25:03,820
They must have found him and...

1074
01:25:03,820 --> 01:25:06,230
None of that's your fault, Steve.

1075
01:25:09,460 --> 01:25:11,670
Even when I had
nothing, I had Bucky.

1076
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:16,400
We need to get a doctor here.

1077
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:17,670
If we don't put
pressure on that wound,

1078
01:25:17,670 --> 01:25:19,380
she's gonna bleed out
here in the truck.

1079
01:25:27,050 --> 01:25:30,180
That thing was squeezing my brain.

1080
01:25:32,590 --> 01:25:34,190
Who is this guy?

1081
01:25:44,660 --> 01:25:47,180
Three holes. Start digging.

1082
01:26:13,630 --> 01:26:15,730
GSW. She's lost at least a pint.

1083
01:26:15,730 --> 01:26:17,230
Maybe two.

1084
01:26:17,230 --> 01:26:19,780
- Let me take her.
- She'll want to see him first.

1085
01:26:29,110 --> 01:26:31,880
About damn time.

1086
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:35,380
Lacerated spinal column,

1087
01:26:35,610 --> 01:26:36,880
cracked sternum,

1088
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:38,580
shattered collarbone,

1089
01:26:38,580 --> 01:26:40,620
perforated liver,

1090
01:26:40,620 --> 01:26:42,620
and one hell of a headache.

1091
01:26:42,620 --> 01:26:44,090
Don't forget your collapsed lung.

1092
01:26:44,090 --> 01:26:45,690
Let's not forget that.

1093
01:26:45,690 --> 01:26:47,690
Otherwise, I'm good.

1094
01:26:47,690 --> 01:26:49,890
They cut you open.
Your heart stopped.

1095
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:52,160
Tetrodotoxin B.

1096
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:54,370
Slows the pulse to
one beat a minute.

1097
01:26:54,370 --> 01:26:56,370
Banner developed it for stress.

1098
01:26:56,370 --> 01:26:59,140
Didn't work so great for him,
but we found a use for it.

1099
01:26:59,140 --> 01:27:01,210
Why all the secrecy?
Why not just tell us?

1100
01:27:01,210 --> 01:27:03,940
Any attempt on the Director's
life had to look successful.

1101
01:27:03,940 --> 01:27:06,580
Can't kill you if
you're already dead.

1102
01:27:06,580 --> 01:27:08,210
Besides,

1103
01:27:08,850 --> 01:27:10,950
I wasn't sure who to trust.

1104
01:27:25,900 --> 01:27:27,840
Sergeant Barnes.

1105
01:27:29,500 --> 01:27:31,040
Bucky, no!

1106
01:27:34,140 --> 01:27:37,740
The procedure has already started.

1107
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:45,180
You are to be the
new fist of HYDRA.

1108
01:27:45,180 --> 01:27:46,730
Put him on ice.

1109
01:27:57,660 --> 01:27:59,200
Sir.

1110
01:27:59,330 --> 01:28:01,270
He's unstable.

1111
01:28:01,300 --> 01:28:03,140
Erratic.

1112
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:17,510
Mission report.

1113
01:28:20,620 --> 01:28:22,360
Mission report now.

1114
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:36,610
The man on the bridge.

1115
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:41,040
Who was he?

1116
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:44,650
You met him earlier this
week on another assignment.

1117
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:49,190
I knew him.

1118
01:28:57,220 --> 01:29:00,270
Your work has been
a gift to mankind.

1119
01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:04,100
You shaped the century.

1120
01:29:04,260 --> 01:29:07,170
And I need you to do
it one more time.

1121
01:29:07,930 --> 01:29:11,770
Society's at a tipping point
between order and chaos.

1122
01:29:11,770 --> 01:29:15,110
And tomorrow morning,
we're gonna give it a push.

1123
01:29:15,740 --> 01:29:19,320
But, if you don't do your
part, I can't do mine.

1124
01:29:20,610 --> 01:29:23,950
And HYDRA can't give the world
the freedom it deserves.

1125
01:29:26,450 --> 01:29:28,460
But I knew him.

1126
01:29:34,660 --> 01:29:36,290
Prep him.

1127
01:29:36,290 --> 01:29:39,030
He's been out of cryo
freeze too long.

1128
01:29:39,030 --> 01:29:41,570
Then wipe him and start over.

1129
01:30:22,700 --> 01:30:26,910
This man declined the
Nobel Peace Prize.

1130
01:30:27,070 --> 01:30:30,740
He said peace wasn't
an achievement,

1131
01:30:30,740 --> 01:30:33,350
it was a responsibility.

1132
01:30:33,810 --> 01:30:37,660
See, it's stuff like this
that gives me trust issues.

1133
01:30:37,850 --> 01:30:39,660
We have to stop the launch.

1134
01:30:40,120 --> 01:30:43,330
I don't think the Council's
accepting my calls anymore.

1135
01:30:45,430 --> 01:30:46,760
What's that?

1136
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:49,660
Once the helicarriers
reach 3,000 feet,

1137
01:30:49,660 --> 01:30:53,400
they'll triangulate with Insight
satellites, becoming fully weaponized.

1138
01:30:53,730 --> 01:30:55,570
We need to breach those carriers

1139
01:30:55,570 --> 01:30:58,140
and replace their targeting
blades with our own.

1140
01:30:58,140 --> 01:30:59,370
One or two won't cut it.

1141
01:30:59,370 --> 01:31:02,010
We need to link all three
carriers for this to work,

1142
01:31:02,010 --> 01:31:05,640
because if even one of those
ships remains operational,

1143
01:31:05,650 --> 01:31:07,650
a whole lot of people
are gonna die.

1144
01:31:07,650 --> 01:31:11,080
We have to assume everyone
aboard those carriers is HYDRA.

1145
01:31:11,080 --> 01:31:13,450
We have to get past them,
insert these server blades.

1146
01:31:13,450 --> 01:31:16,620
And maybe, just maybe we
can salvage what's left...

1147
01:31:16,620 --> 01:31:17,860
We're not salvaging anything.

1148
01:31:17,860 --> 01:31:19,390
We're not just taking
down the carriers, Nick.

1149
01:31:19,390 --> 01:31:20,530
We're taking down S.H.I.E.L.D.

1150
01:31:20,530 --> 01:31:21,930
S.H.I.E.L.D. had nothing
to do with this.

1151
01:31:21,930 --> 01:31:24,300
You gave me this mission.
This is how it ends.

1152
01:31:24,300 --> 01:31:26,700
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s been compromised.
You said so yourself.

1153
01:31:26,700 --> 01:31:28,570
HYDRA grew right under your
nose and nobody noticed.

1154
01:31:28,570 --> 01:31:31,940
Why do you think we're meeting
in this cave? I noticed.

1155
01:31:31,940 --> 01:31:34,140
How many paid the
price before you did?

1156
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:38,610
Look, I didn't know about Barnes.

1157
01:31:38,610 --> 01:31:40,590
Even if you had, would
you have told me?

1158
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:43,650
Or would you have
compartmentalized that, too?

1159
01:31:43,650 --> 01:31:46,650
S.H.I.E.L.D., HYDRA,

1160
01:31:46,650 --> 01:31:48,460
it all goes.

1161
01:31:48,620 --> 01:31:50,200
He's right.

1162
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:56,690
Don't look at me.

1163
01:31:56,700 --> 01:31:59,280
I do what he does, just slower.

1164
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:04,500
Well...

1165
01:32:10,270 --> 01:32:13,290
It looks like you're giving
the orders now, Captain.

1166
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:26,260
We looked for you, after.

1167
01:32:27,090 --> 01:32:29,330
My folks wanted to give you
a ride to the cemetery.

1168
01:32:29,330 --> 01:32:33,340
I know, I'm sorry. I just
kind of wanted to be alone.

1169
01:32:33,970 --> 01:32:35,800
How was it?

1170
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:37,730
It was okay.

1171
01:32:37,740 --> 01:32:40,140
She's next to Dad.

1172
01:32:41,210 --> 01:32:42,810
I was gonna ask...

1173
01:32:42,810 --> 01:32:44,910
I know what you're gonna
say, Buck. I just...

1174
01:32:45,580 --> 01:32:47,210
We can put the couch
cushions on the floor

1175
01:32:47,210 --> 01:32:49,190
like when we were kids.

1176
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:52,380
It'll be fun. All you got
to do is shine my shoes,

1177
01:32:52,380 --> 01:32:54,490
maybe take out the trash.

1178
01:32:59,020 --> 01:33:01,070
Come on.

1179
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:07,370
Thank you, Buck, but I
can get by on my own.

1180
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:12,110
The thing is, you don't have to.

1181
01:33:14,770 --> 01:33:16,980
I'm with you to the
end of the line, pal.

1182
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:21,180
He's gonna be there, you know.

1183
01:33:21,180 --> 01:33:22,760
I know.

1184
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:27,020
Look, whoever he used to
be and the guy he is now,

1185
01:33:27,080 --> 01:33:29,550
I don't think he's
the kind you save.

1186
01:33:29,550 --> 01:33:31,390
He's the kind you stop.

1187
01:33:33,690 --> 01:33:35,590
I don't know if I can do that.

1188
01:33:35,590 --> 01:33:37,590
Well, he might not
give you a choice.

1189
01:33:37,590 --> 01:33:39,700
He doesn't know you.

1190
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:41,370
He will.

1191
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:45,440
Gear up. It's time.

1192
01:33:47,740 --> 01:33:48,940
You gonna wear that?

1193
01:33:48,940 --> 01:33:52,920
No. If you're gonna fight a
war, you got to wear a uniform.

1194
01:34:00,280 --> 01:34:02,120
Oh, man.

1195
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:05,160
I am so fired.

1196
01:34:29,510 --> 01:34:32,110
We are in final launch sequence.

1197
01:34:33,350 --> 01:34:35,790
We are go on guidance.

1198
01:34:37,220 --> 01:34:39,860
All personnel to launch stations.

1199
01:34:40,050 --> 01:34:41,490
And how was your flight?

1200
01:34:41,490 --> 01:34:42,660
Lovely.

1201
01:34:42,660 --> 01:34:45,190
The ride from the airport, less so.

1202
01:34:45,190 --> 01:34:47,790
Sadly, S.H.I.E.L.D. can't
control everything.

1203
01:34:47,800 --> 01:34:50,200
Including Captain America.

1204
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:55,940
This facility is
biometrically controlled.

1205
01:34:55,940 --> 01:34:59,350
And these will give you
unrestricted access.

1206
01:35:02,780 --> 01:35:04,210
I've been parking
there for two months.

1207
01:35:04,210 --> 01:35:05,980
- But it's his spot.
- So where's he been?

1208
01:35:05,980 --> 01:35:07,350
I think Afghanistan.

1209
01:35:07,350 --> 01:35:09,620
Negative DT Six.
The pattern is full.

1210
01:35:09,620 --> 01:35:11,320
Well, he could've said something.

1211
01:35:12,550 --> 01:35:14,260
Must be the dish.

1212
01:35:15,690 --> 01:35:17,790
I'll check it out.

1213
01:35:17,990 --> 01:35:21,540
Triskelion command request we
clear the area for launch.

1214
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:25,700
Excuse us.

1215
01:35:25,700 --> 01:35:28,630
I know the road hasn't
exactly been smooth,

1216
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:32,550
and some of you would have gladly
kicked me out of the car along the way.

1217
01:35:34,310 --> 01:35:35,820
Finally, we're here.

1218
01:35:36,010 --> 01:35:38,450
And the world should be grateful.

1219
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:40,750
Attention all S.H.I.E.L.D. agents,

1220
01:35:40,750 --> 01:35:43,190
this is Steve Rogers.

1221
01:35:44,420 --> 01:35:47,230
You've heard a lot about
me over the last few days.

1222
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:50,320
Some of you were even
ordered to hunt me down.

1223
01:35:50,690 --> 01:35:54,070
But I think it's time
you know the truth.

1224
01:35:56,700 --> 01:35:58,930
S.H.I.E.L.D. is not
what we thought it was.

1225
01:35:58,930 --> 01:36:01,310
It's been taken over by HYDRA.

1226
01:36:01,740 --> 01:36:04,080
Alexander Pierce is their leader.

1227
01:36:07,670 --> 01:36:10,180
The S.T.R.I.K.E. and Insight
crew are HYDRA as well.

1228
01:36:10,180 --> 01:36:11,720
I don't know how many more,

1229
01:36:12,580 --> 01:36:14,120
but I know they're in the building.

1230
01:36:15,310 --> 01:36:17,690
They could be standing
right next to you.

1231
01:36:18,650 --> 01:36:20,990
They almost have what they want.

1232
01:36:21,190 --> 01:36:23,720
Absolute control.

1233
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:25,670
They shot Nick Fury.

1234
01:36:26,260 --> 01:36:27,830
And it won't end there.

1235
01:36:27,830 --> 01:36:30,330
If you launch those
helicarriers today,

1236
01:36:30,330 --> 01:36:32,840
HYDRA will be able to kill
anyone that stands in their way.

1237
01:36:35,630 --> 01:36:37,410
Unless we stop them.

1238
01:36:40,870 --> 01:36:42,580
I know I'm asking a lot.

1239
01:36:44,010 --> 01:36:47,720
But the price of freedom
is high. It always has been.

1240
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:50,260
And it's a price I'm
willing to pay.

1241
01:36:52,220 --> 01:36:55,460
And if I'm the only
one, then so be it.

1242
01:36:56,720 --> 01:36:58,960
But I'm willing to bet I'm not.

1243
01:37:03,130 --> 01:37:07,040
Did you write that down first, or
was it off the top of your head?

1244
01:37:07,070 --> 01:37:09,270
You smug son of a bitch.

1245
01:37:12,740 --> 01:37:14,150
Arrest him.

1246
01:37:16,670 --> 01:37:18,720
I guess I've got the floor.

1247
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:28,490
Preempt the launch sequence.
Send those ships up now.

1248
01:37:32,460 --> 01:37:34,400
Is there a problem?

1249
01:37:38,900 --> 01:37:40,200
Is there a problem?

1250
01:37:40,200 --> 01:37:41,800
I'm sorry, sir.

1251
01:37:49,970 --> 01:37:52,710
I'm not gonna launch those ships.

1252
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:56,480
Captain's orders.

1253
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:58,050
Move away from your station.

1254
01:37:58,050 --> 01:37:59,280
Like he said...

1255
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:00,450
Hold it right there.

1256
01:38:00,450 --> 01:38:01,850
Put the gun down!

1257
01:38:01,850 --> 01:38:03,400
Captain's orders.

1258
01:38:05,320 --> 01:38:07,160
You picked the wrong side, Agent.

1259
01:38:08,590 --> 01:38:10,690
Depends on where you're standing.

1260
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:56,240
Close the bay door!

1261
01:38:56,240 --> 01:38:57,870
Close the bay door now!

1262
01:38:57,870 --> 01:38:59,380
Close the bay door!

1263
01:39:18,630 --> 01:39:20,430
They're initiating launch.

1264
01:39:40,180 --> 01:39:42,920
Hey, Cap, how do we know the
good guys from the bad guys?

1265
01:39:42,920 --> 01:39:45,020
If they're shooting
at you, they're bad.

1266
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:18,950
Hey, Cap,

1267
01:40:18,950 --> 01:40:21,090
I found those bad guys
you were talking about.

1268
01:40:21,090 --> 01:40:22,630
You okay?

1269
01:40:24,230 --> 01:40:26,200
I'm not dead yet.

1270
01:40:32,630 --> 01:40:35,040
Let me ask you a question.

1271
01:40:36,970 --> 01:40:40,610
What if Pakistan marched
into Mumbai tomorrow

1272
01:40:41,480 --> 01:40:43,680
and you knew that they were
going to drag your daughters

1273
01:40:43,680 --> 01:40:47,120
into a soccer stadium
for execution,

1274
01:40:48,920 --> 01:40:52,550
and you could just stop it,
with a flick of the switch.

1275
01:40:52,550 --> 01:40:53,790
Wouldn't you?

1276
01:40:53,790 --> 01:40:56,090
Wouldn't you all?

1277
01:40:57,420 --> 01:40:59,330
Not if it was your switch.

1278
01:41:23,480 --> 01:41:25,260
I'm sorry.

1279
01:41:30,990 --> 01:41:33,190
Did I step on your moment?

1280
01:41:34,160 --> 01:41:37,000
Satellites in range at 3,000 feet.

1281
01:41:37,400 --> 01:41:38,730
Falcon, status?

1282
01:41:38,730 --> 01:41:40,470
Engaging.

1283
01:42:04,020 --> 01:42:05,930
All right, Cap. I'm in.

1284
01:42:07,630 --> 01:42:09,200
Oh, shit.

1285
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:41,200
Eight minutes, Cap.

1286
01:42:41,260 --> 01:42:43,270
Working on it.

1287
01:42:50,970 --> 01:42:52,100
What are you doing?

1288
01:42:52,100 --> 01:42:53,700
She's disabling security protocols

1289
01:42:53,710 --> 01:42:55,670
and dumping all the secrets
onto the Internet.

1290
01:42:55,670 --> 01:42:57,880
- Including HYDRA'S.
- And S.H.I.E.L.D.'s.

1291
01:42:58,540 --> 01:42:59,940
If you do this,

1292
01:42:59,940 --> 01:43:02,290
none of your past is
gonna remain hidden.

1293
01:43:04,680 --> 01:43:07,520
Are you sure you're ready
for the world to see you

1294
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:09,500
as you really are?

1295
01:43:09,690 --> 01:43:11,700
Are you?

1296
01:43:27,510 --> 01:43:29,050
Alpha lock.

1297
01:43:30,710 --> 01:43:32,080
Falcon, where are you now?

1298
01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:33,480
I had to take a detour.

1299
01:44:05,710 --> 01:44:07,720
Oh, yeah!

1300
01:44:13,180 --> 01:44:14,780
I'm in.

1301
01:44:17,790 --> 01:44:20,130
Bravo lock.

1302
01:44:21,560 --> 01:44:23,260
Two down, one to go.

1303
01:44:25,060 --> 01:44:27,160
All S.H.I.E.L.D. pilots, scramble.

1304
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:30,540
We're the only air support
Captain Rogers has got.

1305
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:15,480
Disabling the encryption
is an executive order.

1306
01:45:15,480 --> 01:45:17,310
It takes two Alpha Level members.

1307
01:45:17,310 --> 01:45:19,820
Don't worry. Company's coming.

1308
01:45:42,840 --> 01:45:44,470
Did you get my flowers?

1309
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:48,980
- I'm glad you're here, Nick.
- Really?

1310
01:45:50,380 --> 01:45:52,480
Because I thought
you had me killed.

1311
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:54,390
You know how the game works.

1312
01:45:54,920 --> 01:45:56,680
So why make me head
of S.H.I.E.L.D.?

1313
01:45:56,680 --> 01:45:58,220
Because you were the best,

1314
01:45:58,220 --> 01:45:59,990
and the most ruthless
person I ever met.

1315
01:45:59,990 --> 01:46:02,760
I did what I did to protect people.

1316
01:46:03,120 --> 01:46:05,640
Our enemies are your enemies, Nick.

1317
01:46:05,990 --> 01:46:08,900
Disorder. War.

1318
01:46:09,400 --> 01:46:11,830
It's just a matter of time before
a dirty bomb goes off in Moscow,

1319
01:46:11,830 --> 01:46:14,540
or an EMP fries Chicago.

1320
01:46:15,700 --> 01:46:17,240
Diplomacy?

1321
01:46:17,240 --> 01:46:20,150
A holding action, Nick. A band-aid.

1322
01:46:20,510 --> 01:46:23,950
And you know where I
learned that. Bogota.

1323
01:46:25,110 --> 01:46:28,280
You didn't ask. You just
did what had to be done.

1324
01:46:28,980 --> 01:46:33,890
I can bring order to the lives
of seven billion people

1325
01:46:34,020 --> 01:46:36,260
by sacrificing 20 million.

1326
01:46:37,220 --> 01:46:39,390
It's the next step, Nick.

1327
01:46:39,390 --> 01:46:40,590
If you have the courage to take it.

1328
01:46:40,590 --> 01:46:43,230
No. I have the courage not to.

1329
01:46:47,330 --> 01:46:49,740
Retinal scanner active.

1330
01:46:50,600 --> 01:46:53,270
You don't think we've wiped
your clearance from the system?

1331
01:46:53,270 --> 01:46:55,440
I know you erased my password.

1332
01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:57,780
Probably deleted my retinal scan.

1333
01:46:57,780 --> 01:47:01,190
But if you want to stay
ahead of me, Mr. Secretary,

1334
01:47:04,580 --> 01:47:08,290
you need to keep both eyes open.

1335
01:47:12,060 --> 01:47:14,060
Alpha level confirmed.

1336
01:47:14,060 --> 01:47:16,090
Encryption code accepted.

1337
01:47:16,100 --> 01:47:17,560
Safeguards removed.

1338
01:47:17,560 --> 01:47:21,300
Charlie carrier is 45
degrees off the port bow.

1339
01:47:26,410 --> 01:47:27,710
Six minutes.

1340
01:47:27,710 --> 01:47:30,550
Hey, Sam, gonna need a ride.

1341
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:33,220
Roger. Let me know
when you're ready.

1342
01:47:35,210 --> 01:47:36,990
I just did!

1343
01:47:54,230 --> 01:47:56,330
You know, you're a lot
heavier than you look.

1344
01:47:56,330 --> 01:47:57,940
I had a big breakfast.

1345
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:01,950
Steve!

1346
01:48:31,740 --> 01:48:33,700
Cap! Cap, come in. Are you okay?

1347
01:48:33,700 --> 01:48:35,610
Yeah, I'm here.

1348
01:48:35,710 --> 01:48:37,280
I'm still on the helicarrier.

1349
01:48:37,640 --> 01:48:39,910
- Where are you?
- I'm grounded.

1350
01:48:39,910 --> 01:48:42,860
The suit's down. Sorry, Cap.

1351
01:48:43,110 --> 01:48:45,490
Don't worry. I got it.

1352
01:48:46,980 --> 01:48:48,620
Emergency evacuation alert.

1353
01:48:48,620 --> 01:48:52,130
All personnel, proceed to
designated safety zones.

1354
01:48:53,260 --> 01:48:55,670
All S.H.I.E.L.D. agents
regroup at Rally Point Delta.

1355
01:49:00,830 --> 01:49:03,330
Sir, the Council's been breached.

1356
01:49:03,330 --> 01:49:05,870
- Repeat, Dispatch.
- Black Widow's up there.

1357
01:49:05,870 --> 01:49:07,810
Headed up.

1358
01:49:09,510 --> 01:49:10,740
- Falcon?
- Yeah.

1359
01:49:10,740 --> 01:49:11,840
Rumlow's headed for the Council.

1360
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:13,390
I'm on it.

1361
01:49:24,520 --> 01:49:26,100
People are gonna die, Buck.

1362
01:49:27,690 --> 01:49:29,600
I can't let that happen.

1363
01:49:37,630 --> 01:49:39,410
Please don't make me do this.

1364
01:50:48,940 --> 01:50:50,450
Done.

1365
01:50:51,140 --> 01:50:52,680
And it's trending.

1366
01:50:59,710 --> 01:51:01,620
Unless you want a two-inch
hole in your sternum,

1367
01:51:01,620 --> 01:51:03,250
I'd put that gun down.

1368
01:51:05,620 --> 01:51:08,060
That was armed the
moment you pinned it on.

1369
01:51:41,290 --> 01:51:42,920
Drop it!

1370
01:51:42,990 --> 01:51:44,530
Drop it!

1371
01:52:04,580 --> 01:52:08,220
I'm on 41, headed toward
the southwest stairwell.

1372
01:52:14,550 --> 01:52:16,600
This is gonna hurt.

1373
01:52:17,420 --> 01:52:20,590
There are no prisoners
with HYDRA. Just order.

1374
01:52:20,590 --> 01:52:23,330
And order only comes through pain.

1375
01:52:24,330 --> 01:52:27,100
- You ready for yours?
- Man, shut the hell up.

1376
01:52:28,530 --> 01:52:29,870
Lieutenant, how much longer?

1377
01:52:29,870 --> 01:52:32,040
65 seconds to satellite link.

1378
01:52:32,040 --> 01:52:35,590
Targeting grid engaged.
Lowering weapons array now.

1379
01:52:39,010 --> 01:52:40,650
One minute.

1380
01:53:00,030 --> 01:53:02,240
30 seconds, Cap.

1381
01:53:03,230 --> 01:53:04,970
Stand by.

1382
01:53:07,510 --> 01:53:09,550
Charlie...

1383
01:53:18,380 --> 01:53:20,220
We've reached 3,000 feet.

1384
01:53:20,550 --> 01:53:22,290
Sat link coming online now.

1385
01:53:24,220 --> 01:53:25,800
Deploy algorithm.

1386
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:28,560
Algorithm deployed.

1387
01:53:29,390 --> 01:53:31,300
We are go to target.

1388
01:53:49,780 --> 01:53:51,710
Target saturation reached.

1389
01:53:51,720 --> 01:53:52,620
All targets assigned.

1390
01:53:52,620 --> 01:53:54,160
Fire when ready.

1391
01:53:56,220 --> 01:53:57,690
Firing in...

1392
01:53:57,690 --> 01:53:58,890
Three,

1393
01:53:58,890 --> 01:54:00,430
two...

1394
01:54:01,130 --> 01:54:03,100
One.

1395
01:54:05,130 --> 01:54:06,530
Charlie lock.

1396
01:54:06,530 --> 01:54:08,270
Where are the targets?

1397
01:54:09,130 --> 01:54:10,700
Where are the targets?

1398
01:54:10,700 --> 01:54:12,510
Okay, Cap, get out of there.

1399
01:54:29,450 --> 01:54:31,030
Fire now.

1400
01:54:31,590 --> 01:54:33,190
- But, Steve...
- Do it!

1401
01:54:33,590 --> 01:54:35,130
Do it now!

1402
01:55:05,220 --> 01:55:06,460
What a waste.

1403
01:55:06,460 --> 01:55:09,720
So, you still on the fence
about Rogers' chances?

1404
01:55:09,730 --> 01:55:13,270
Time to go, Councilwoman.
This way. Come on.

1405
01:55:13,400 --> 01:55:15,030
You're going to fly me out of here.

1406
01:55:15,030 --> 01:55:18,500
You know, there was a time I
would've taken a bullet for you.

1407
01:55:18,500 --> 01:55:19,870
You already did.

1408
01:55:19,870 --> 01:55:22,310
You will again, when it's useful.

1409
01:55:35,180 --> 01:55:36,890
Romanoff.

1410
01:55:37,050 --> 01:55:38,650
Natasha.

1411
01:55:40,220 --> 01:55:42,530
Natasha! Come on!

1412
01:55:49,030 --> 01:55:51,200
Those really do sting.

1413
01:56:23,530 --> 01:56:25,540
Hail HYDRA.

1414
01:57:20,590 --> 01:57:22,500
You're out of your depth, kid.

1415
01:57:25,590 --> 01:57:27,730
Son of a bitch!

1416
01:57:39,340 --> 01:57:41,380
Please tell me you got
that chopper in the air!

1417
01:57:41,610 --> 01:57:43,240
Sam, where are you?

1418
01:57:43,610 --> 01:57:45,640
41st floor! Northwest corner!

1419
01:57:45,650 --> 01:57:47,550
We're on it! Stay where you are!

1420
01:57:47,550 --> 01:57:49,180
Not an option!

1421
01:58:03,430 --> 01:58:05,830
41st floor! 41st!

1422
01:58:05,830 --> 01:58:09,810
It's not like they put the floor numbers
on the outside of the building.

1423
01:58:10,700 --> 01:58:13,650
Hill! Where's Steve? You
got a location on Rogers?

1424
01:58:29,660 --> 01:58:31,260
You know me.

1425
01:58:32,490 --> 01:58:34,200
No, I don't!

1426
01:58:43,300 --> 01:58:45,210
Bucky.

1427
01:58:46,070 --> 01:58:48,170
You've known me your whole life.

1428
01:58:55,050 --> 01:58:59,250
Your name is James Buchanan Barnes.

1429
01:58:59,250 --> 01:59:01,020
Shut up!

1430
01:59:09,160 --> 01:59:11,260
I'm not gonna fight you.

1431
01:59:14,530 --> 01:59:16,440
You're my friend.

1432
01:59:22,910 --> 01:59:24,920
You're my mission.

1433
01:59:26,540 --> 01:59:29,250
You're my mission!

1434
01:59:31,980 --> 01:59:33,530
Then finish it.

1435
01:59:36,520 --> 01:59:39,260
Because I'm with you to
the end of the line.

1436
02:01:50,380 --> 02:01:52,120
On your left.

1437
02:02:42,570 --> 02:02:45,240
Do you solemnly swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth,

1438
02:02:45,240 --> 02:02:46,610
and nothing but the truth?

1439
02:02:46,610 --> 02:02:48,410
I do.

1440
02:02:49,940 --> 02:02:52,280
Why haven't we yet heard
from Captain Rogers?

1441
02:02:54,450 --> 02:02:56,580
I don't know what there
is left for him to say.

1442
02:02:56,580 --> 02:02:58,650
I think the wreck in the
middle of the Potomac

1443
02:02:58,650 --> 02:02:59,880
made his point fairly eloquently.

1444
02:02:59,890 --> 02:03:01,090
Well, he could explain how

1445
02:03:01,090 --> 02:03:03,820
this country is expected to
maintain its national security

1446
02:03:03,820 --> 02:03:08,460
now that he and you have laid waste
to our intelligence apparatus.

1447
02:03:08,460 --> 02:03:10,600
HYDRA was selling you
lies, not intelligence.

1448
02:03:10,600 --> 02:03:13,700
Many of which you seemed to have
had a personal hand in telling.

1449
02:03:13,700 --> 02:03:15,000
Agent, you should know

1450
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:16,830
that there are some
on this committee

1451
02:03:16,840 --> 02:03:19,200
who feel, given your
service record,

1452
02:03:19,200 --> 02:03:21,410
both for this country
and against it,

1453
02:03:21,610 --> 02:03:23,570
that you belong in a penitentiary.

1454
02:03:23,580 --> 02:03:26,280
Not mouthing off on Capitol Hill.

1455
02:03:27,650 --> 02:03:29,620
You're not going to
put me in a prison.

1456
02:03:30,120 --> 02:03:34,530
You're not going to put any of
us in a prison. You know why?

1457
02:03:35,550 --> 02:03:37,160
Do enlighten us.

1458
02:03:37,160 --> 02:03:39,100
Because you need us.

1459
02:03:39,530 --> 02:03:42,090
Yes, the world is a
vulnerable place,

1460
02:03:42,090 --> 02:03:44,730
and yes, we help make it that way.

1461
02:03:44,730 --> 02:03:48,170
But we're also the ones best
qualified to defend it.

1462
02:03:49,230 --> 02:03:51,680
So, if you want to
arrest me, arrest me.

1463
02:03:52,240 --> 02:03:54,370
You'll know where to find me.

1464
02:04:29,370 --> 02:04:32,610
So, you've experienced
this sort of thing before.

1465
02:04:32,610 --> 02:04:34,780
You get used to it.

1466
02:04:36,910 --> 02:04:39,380
We've been data
mining HYDRA'S files.

1467
02:04:39,380 --> 02:04:42,090
Looks like a lot of rats
didn't go down with the ship.

1468
02:04:43,020 --> 02:04:44,960
I'm headed to Europe tonight.

1469
02:04:45,360 --> 02:04:47,200
Wanted to ask if you'd come.

1470
02:04:47,690 --> 02:04:49,930
There's something I
got to do first.

1471
02:04:50,330 --> 02:04:53,310
How about you, Wilson? Could
use a man with your abilities.

1472
02:04:53,800 --> 02:04:56,210
I'm more of a soldier than a spy.

1473
02:04:56,600 --> 02:04:59,040
All right, then.

1474
02:05:03,070 --> 02:05:07,850
Anybody asks for me, tell them
they can find me, right here.

1475
02:05:09,110 --> 02:05:10,850
You should be honored. That's
about as close as he gets

1476
02:05:10,850 --> 02:05:13,090
to saying thank you.

1477
02:05:13,620 --> 02:05:15,220
Not going with him?

1478
02:05:15,290 --> 02:05:16,650
No.

1479
02:05:16,650 --> 02:05:19,200
- Not staying here.
- Nah.

1480
02:05:19,660 --> 02:05:21,920
I blew all my covers. I got
to go figure out a new one.

1481
02:05:21,930 --> 02:05:23,470
That might take a while.

1482
02:05:23,530 --> 02:05:25,570
I'm counting on it.

1483
02:05:27,330 --> 02:05:28,730
That thing you asked for,

1484
02:05:28,730 --> 02:05:31,570
I called in a few favors from Kiev.

1485
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:37,240
Will you do me a favor?
Call that nurse.

1486
02:05:37,240 --> 02:05:38,540
She's not a nurse.

1487
02:05:38,540 --> 02:05:41,050
And you're not a
S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.

1488
02:05:41,440 --> 02:05:44,050
- What was her name again?
- Sharon.

1489
02:05:44,250 --> 02:05:45,790
She's nice.

1490
02:05:57,590 --> 02:06:00,000
Be careful, Steve.

1491
02:06:00,300 --> 02:06:02,530
You might not want to
pull on that thread.

1492
02:06:13,680 --> 02:06:15,680
You're going after him.

1493
02:06:15,680 --> 02:06:17,210
You don't have to come with me.

1494
02:06:17,210 --> 02:06:18,790
I know.

1495
02:06:20,250 --> 02:06:21,990
When do we start?

1496
02:08:20,700 --> 02:08:25,010
It's over. Fury has released
everything to the public.

1497
02:08:25,140 --> 02:08:27,040
Everything he knows about.

1498
02:08:27,040 --> 02:08:29,070
Herr Strucker, if they get
word of our work here,

1499
02:08:29,080 --> 02:08:31,080
if they find out we serve HYDRA...

1500
02:08:31,080 --> 02:08:33,250
HYDRA, S.H.I.E.L.D.

1501
02:08:33,710 --> 02:08:37,090
Two sides of a coin that's
no longer currency.

1502
02:08:40,520 --> 02:08:42,460
What we have

1503
02:08:43,990 --> 02:08:47,230
is worth more than any
of them ever knew.

1504
02:08:49,290 --> 02:08:53,500
We've only scratched the
surface and already,

1505
02:08:55,670 --> 02:09:00,220
there are other facilities doing
HYDRA'S good work around the world.

1506
02:09:00,740 --> 02:09:04,480
We'll feed them to Captain America
and his colorful friends,

1507
02:09:04,480 --> 02:09:06,510
and keep them off our scent.

1508
02:09:06,510 --> 02:09:08,880
What about the volunteers?

1509
02:09:08,880 --> 02:09:10,550
The dead will be buried so deep

1510
02:09:10,550 --> 02:09:13,250
their own ghosts won't
be able to find them.

1511
02:09:14,850 --> 02:09:16,660
And the survivors?

1512
02:09:18,290 --> 02:09:20,230
The twins.

1513
02:09:23,400 --> 02:09:27,000
Sooner or later, they
will meet the twins.

1514
02:09:28,530 --> 02:09:30,730
It's not a world of spies anymore.

1515
02:09:30,740 --> 02:09:33,250
Not even a world of heroes.

1516
02:09:33,670 --> 02:09:37,010
This is the age of
miracles, Doctor.

1517
02:09:38,380 --> 02:09:41,290
There's nothing more horrifying

1518
02:09:41,510 --> 02:09:43,220
than a miracle.
