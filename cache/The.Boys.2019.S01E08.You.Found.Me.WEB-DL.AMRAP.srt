1
00:00:20,993 --> 00:00:22,453
Howdy, boys.

2
00:00:22,495 --> 00:00:24,285
Oh, sorry.
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

3
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,170
How are you guys doing? Good?

4
00:00:26,207 --> 00:00:29,707
Why don't you, uh, go have
a smoke or something, okay?

5
00:00:29,752 --> 00:00:30,712
I got this.

6
00:00:30,753 --> 00:00:35,013
Oh, and, uh, you guys...

7
00:00:35,049 --> 00:00:37,969
you are the real heroes.

8
00:00:56,195 --> 00:00:58,565
Gentlemen.

9
00:01:02,201 --> 00:01:03,831
Oh!

10
00:02:07,808 --> 00:02:10,018
All clear, boys.

11
00:02:10,061 --> 00:02:11,231
Mission accomplished.

12
00:02:18,152 --> 00:02:20,112
God bless America.

13
00:02:20,154 --> 00:02:21,614
Captain.

14
00:02:21,655 --> 00:02:25,115
I found this.

15
00:02:27,203 --> 00:02:29,583
The Islamic State is not exactly

16
00:02:29,622 --> 00:02:34,042
a hotbed
of scientific expertise.

17
00:02:34,085 --> 00:02:36,165
But they've counterfeited

18
00:02:36,212 --> 00:02:39,132
this Compound V shit of yours?

19
00:02:39,173 --> 00:02:42,973
It seems that way,
Mr. Secretary.

20
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,470
How did they get the formula?

21
00:02:45,513 --> 00:02:48,023
Honestly, we have no idea.

22
00:02:48,057 --> 00:02:51,637
Well, you must have some idea.

23
00:02:51,685 --> 00:02:55,055
Some tourist shoplift it
from your lab?

24
00:02:55,106 --> 00:02:57,606
Or maybe an inside job?

25
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:00,570
Sir, we would like to get
to the bottom of this

26
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:01,951
as much as you would.

27
00:03:01,987 --> 00:03:03,237
Ms. Stillwell,

28
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,330
if I had my way,
the Justice Department

29
00:03:06,367 --> 00:03:08,537
would haul your smug,
tennis-toned ass

30
00:03:08,577 --> 00:03:11,957
into Congress
and make you testify

31
00:03:11,997 --> 00:03:13,957
to corporate fraud.

32
00:03:13,999 --> 00:03:18,299
What is Lockheed Martin's
number one product?

33
00:03:18,337 --> 00:03:19,297
Sorry?

34
00:03:19,338 --> 00:03:21,088
Its top seller.

35
00:03:21,132 --> 00:03:22,472
You should know this,

36
00:03:22,508 --> 00:03:24,678
you served
on their board of directors.

37
00:03:24,718 --> 00:03:26,718
- The Patriot missile.
- Correct.

38
00:03:26,762 --> 00:03:28,102
Northrop?

39
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:29,519
B-2 Stealth.

40
00:03:29,557 --> 00:03:31,137
General Dynamics?

41
00:03:31,183 --> 00:03:34,353
Tomahawk and the M1 Abrams.

42
00:03:34,395 --> 00:03:37,435
Billions of dollars
of bleeding-edge hardware.

43
00:03:37,481 --> 00:03:41,741
Do you know what all of that
is as of today?

44
00:03:41,777 --> 00:03:44,817
A worthless pile of shit.

45
00:03:44,864 --> 00:03:48,374
Because Naqib and other
super terrorists like him

46
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:50,909
can flick away that junk
like flicking a flea.

47
00:03:50,953 --> 00:03:54,623
So it doesn't matter
where heroes really come from.

48
00:03:54,665 --> 00:03:56,625
Frankly, it doesn't even matter

49
00:03:56,667 --> 00:03:58,957
how the enemy got
the Compound V.

50
00:03:59,003 --> 00:04:01,673
What matters is they've got it.

51
00:04:01,714 --> 00:04:05,134
It is a whole new world now.

52
00:04:05,176 --> 00:04:07,296
And there is only one company

53
00:04:07,344 --> 00:04:11,144
that has the product
to fight back.

54
00:04:14,894 --> 00:04:16,904
My company.

55
00:04:16,937 --> 00:04:18,897
My product.

56
00:04:18,939 --> 00:04:21,439
What can I say?

57
00:04:21,484 --> 00:04:24,324
The Pentagon's agreed to keep
Compound V classified.

58
00:04:24,361 --> 00:04:25,951
Classified?

59
00:04:25,988 --> 00:04:27,618
What the fuck are you on about?

60
00:04:27,656 --> 00:04:30,326
Because of the Naqib asshole
that is out there,

61
00:04:30,367 --> 00:04:32,617
we have to keep Vought
happy now.

62
00:04:32,661 --> 00:04:35,501
Vought are the ones that fucking
created the cunt.

63
00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:38,079
- We have no solid proof on that.
- No hard proof?

64
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,495
I fucking well rescued
the proof from a basement.

65
00:04:40,544 --> 00:04:43,384
She's sitting on a bloody bog
as we speak.

66
00:04:43,422 --> 00:04:44,972
Listen. Listen.

67
00:04:45,007 --> 00:04:46,967
Vought's manufacturing
super villains.

68
00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:48,259
It's the story of the century.

69
00:04:48,302 --> 00:04:51,602
Don't you want
a fucking Pulitzer?

70
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:53,559
Well, fuck you, too, then.

71
00:05:06,529 --> 00:05:09,159
Susan, come on.

72
00:05:09,198 --> 00:05:12,538
There must be something
we can do here, yeah?

73
00:05:12,576 --> 00:05:15,616
Look, the military deal
is signed and sealed.

74
00:05:15,663 --> 00:05:18,463
Do you think one mute girl
is going to derail that?

75
00:05:18,499 --> 00:05:20,039
Especially coming
from the fugitives

76
00:05:20,084 --> 00:05:23,004
- that killed Translucent?
- Fugitives?

77
00:05:23,045 --> 00:05:27,005
Vought insisted and...
and the DOJ agreed.

78
00:05:27,049 --> 00:05:28,679
You're wanted men now.

79
00:05:28,717 --> 00:05:30,637
Hello?

80
00:05:30,678 --> 00:05:31,928
This isn't a day spa.

81
00:05:31,971 --> 00:05:33,761
Other people got
to use the facilities.

82
00:05:57,663 --> 00:05:59,963
Look, I gave you the V.

83
00:05:59,999 --> 00:06:02,329
I gave you everything
you asked for and more.

84
00:06:02,376 --> 00:06:04,229
I trusted you, and this is
the fucking thanks I get.

85
00:06:04,253 --> 00:06:07,213
Butcher, I will still protect
your families.

86
00:06:07,256 --> 00:06:09,586
Yeah, and keep
your bleeding career even safer.

87
00:06:09,633 --> 00:06:11,683
Well, what about me
and the Boys, then, eh?

88
00:06:11,719 --> 00:06:14,139
You cut bait and run
for your lives.

89
00:06:14,179 --> 00:06:16,719
I'm sorry.

90
00:06:19,977 --> 00:06:21,767
Yeah, mm-hmm.

91
00:06:21,812 --> 00:06:22,942
Right.

92
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,480
All right, then, love.

93
00:06:25,524 --> 00:06:28,744
Well, that's all under control,
isn't it?

94
00:06:28,777 --> 00:06:31,567
- Oh. We need to split up.
- Mm-hmm.

95
00:06:31,614 --> 00:06:33,204
Oi, what the fuck are you doing?

96
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,620
We ain't, we ain't done yet.

97
00:06:34,658 --> 00:06:36,288
The hell we ain't.

98
00:06:36,327 --> 00:06:37,804
We got Vought, the Supes,
and the Feds on our asses.

99
00:06:37,828 --> 00:06:39,038
I'm going to Montreal.

100
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:40,265
Yeah, and how you gonna get

101
00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:41,308
your crazy-ass girlfriend
over the border?

102
00:06:41,332 --> 00:06:42,332
She has a name.

103
00:06:43,584 --> 00:06:45,294
It's Kimiko. Okay?

104
00:06:45,336 --> 00:06:46,746
- Kimiko.
- Oi, listen.

105
00:06:46,795 --> 00:06:48,205
Shut your fucking traps.

106
00:06:48,255 --> 00:06:50,585
We're on the verge of nailing
these cunts.

107
00:06:50,633 --> 00:06:52,263
And you want to cut bait and run

108
00:06:52,301 --> 00:06:54,181
before we've played
our final card.

109
00:06:54,219 --> 00:06:56,679
Okay, what is it, man?

110
00:06:56,722 --> 00:06:59,982
Give us a couple hours. Yeah?

111
00:07:00,017 --> 00:07:01,057
Hughie, you're with me.

112
00:07:03,103 --> 00:07:04,313
Come on, son.

113
00:07:04,355 --> 00:07:06,355
Chop, chop.

114
00:07:22,247 --> 00:07:24,667
Oh! Annie.

115
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:26,168
You scared me.

116
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,250
You didn't say you were coming.

117
00:07:30,798 --> 00:07:34,048
I hid this under my floorboards
right after Daddy left.

118
00:07:35,594 --> 00:07:37,394
I thought that maybe

119
00:07:37,429 --> 00:07:39,639
he would come back
for it, but...

120
00:07:41,058 --> 00:07:43,348
- Still smells like him.
- It was a bad habit.

121
00:07:43,394 --> 00:07:46,024
His father smoked a pipe,
so, you know...

122
00:07:46,063 --> 00:07:48,943
What's Compound V?

123
00:07:48,982 --> 00:07:50,532
Uh, Compound V?

124
00:07:50,567 --> 00:07:51,937
I don't know, sweetheart.

125
00:07:51,985 --> 00:07:52,985
Should I?

126
00:07:58,492 --> 00:08:01,122
How old was I?
Hmm?

127
00:08:02,746 --> 00:08:07,416
How old was I when you let
Vought pump me full of drugs?

128
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:09,688
- Annie, honestly, I don't know what you're talk...
- How old,

129
00:08:09,712 --> 00:08:11,962
when you let them turn me
into a freak?

130
00:08:12,005 --> 00:08:13,755
You're not a freak.

131
00:08:13,799 --> 00:08:15,049
Never say that.

132
00:08:18,679 --> 00:08:20,009
So it's true.

133
00:08:27,062 --> 00:08:28,482
Annie...

134
00:08:28,522 --> 00:08:32,322
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

135
00:08:36,864 --> 00:08:40,334
- Did, did Vought tell you all this?
- No.

136
00:08:40,367 --> 00:08:43,077
No. A friend told me.

137
00:08:47,332 --> 00:08:49,172
How much did they pay you?

138
00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:52,839
- It wasn't about money.
- How much?

139
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,840
There was no money.

140
00:08:53,881 --> 00:08:55,471
They, they, they just paid

141
00:08:55,507 --> 00:08:58,047
for the medical bills,
that's it.

142
00:08:58,093 --> 00:09:00,553
I did it because they,
they promised

143
00:09:00,596 --> 00:09:04,096
that you'd have a chance
at an extraordinary life.

144
00:09:04,141 --> 00:09:07,441
To be strong and successful
and special.

145
00:09:07,478 --> 00:09:09,308
I mean, who wouldn't
want that for their...

146
00:09:09,354 --> 00:09:12,234
You made me think that I was
chosen by God.

147
00:09:12,274 --> 00:09:13,444
You were!

148
00:09:13,484 --> 00:09:14,864
God brought Vought
into our lives.

149
00:09:14,902 --> 00:09:16,112
He made this possible.

150
00:09:16,153 --> 00:09:18,073
Bullshit!

151
00:09:18,113 --> 00:09:19,703
You did!

152
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:24,160
And then you controlled
every single minute of it.

153
00:09:24,203 --> 00:09:26,373
You woke me up at 5:00 a.m.

154
00:09:26,413 --> 00:09:28,753
to train
for those stupid pageants,

155
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:32,461
and the tap dancing
and the tae kwon do.

156
00:09:32,503 --> 00:09:34,673
I gave up every moment
of my life.

157
00:09:34,713 --> 00:09:36,173
I-I... and I was happy to do it.

158
00:09:36,215 --> 00:09:37,165
This was our dream.

159
00:09:37,216 --> 00:09:38,586
This was your dream!

160
00:09:38,634 --> 00:09:43,224
I never got a chance
to choose my own dreams.

161
00:09:43,263 --> 00:09:45,773
No wonder I don't know who
the fuck I'm supposed to be!

162
00:09:45,808 --> 00:09:47,348
Annie.

163
00:09:54,733 --> 00:09:56,993
Was it really bad investments?

164
00:09:57,027 --> 00:09:58,947
- What?
- You told me that Daddy left

165
00:09:58,987 --> 00:10:01,487
because he lost
all of our savings.

166
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:08,120
He agreed to all of it.

167
00:10:08,163 --> 00:10:12,583
And then, one day,
he... he didn't,

168
00:10:12,626 --> 00:10:14,626
so he walked out on us.

169
00:10:19,383 --> 00:10:21,843
Maybe he didn't want
to lie to me.

170
00:10:21,885 --> 00:10:23,965
So I'm the monster?

171
00:10:24,012 --> 00:10:25,812
You have a good life.

172
00:10:25,848 --> 00:10:29,558
People would give anything
to be what you are.

173
00:10:29,601 --> 00:10:32,601
I thought I did what was right.

174
00:10:34,857 --> 00:10:36,817
Annie, Annie.

175
00:10:36,859 --> 00:10:40,069
Annie! Annie!

176
00:10:40,112 --> 00:10:42,572
It's time to knock back
some of this per diem, buddy.

177
00:10:42,614 --> 00:10:45,204
Oh, it's a pretty fancy bottle.

178
00:10:45,242 --> 00:10:49,002
What are we, uh,
what are we celebrating?

179
00:10:49,037 --> 00:10:50,849
What are you talking about?
The Seven getting called up.

180
00:10:50,873 --> 00:10:52,043
Yeah.

181
00:10:54,585 --> 00:10:56,705
You know the whole reason
the Navy discontinued

182
00:10:56,753 --> 00:11:00,013
their Sea Mammal
mine clearance program?

183
00:11:00,048 --> 00:11:01,468
It's because it cost
way too much

184
00:11:01,508 --> 00:11:03,588
to train the fucking dolphins.

185
00:11:03,635 --> 00:11:05,175
Yeah.

186
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,850
But with me on board,

187
00:11:06,889 --> 00:11:09,389
it's like a, it's like
a pick-up game of basketball.

188
00:11:11,143 --> 00:11:14,193
I've always wanted to lead
my own unit, Jeff.

189
00:11:14,229 --> 00:11:15,649
It's like a dream
come true for me.

190
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:24,619
Smells like a comeback.

191
00:11:25,657 --> 00:11:27,367
- Anyways...
- Hmm.

192
00:11:27,409 --> 00:11:29,159
Cheers, buddy.

193
00:11:29,202 --> 00:11:31,712
So, when?

194
00:11:31,747 --> 00:11:33,667
When, what?

195
00:11:33,707 --> 00:11:35,497
When do I ship out?

196
00:11:35,542 --> 00:11:37,422
Oh.

197
00:11:37,461 --> 00:11:39,171
Gosh.

198
00:11:39,212 --> 00:11:42,012
You know that water park's
opening up a new splash zone,

199
00:11:42,049 --> 00:11:43,429
and, and they are real excited

200
00:11:43,467 --> 00:11:44,986
to have you cut that ribbon.

201
00:11:47,846 --> 00:11:49,926
You know, I'm seriously
leaving, Jeff.

202
00:11:49,973 --> 00:11:51,603
Fuck Ohio.

203
00:11:53,894 --> 00:11:56,564
Here's the sitch.

204
00:11:56,605 --> 00:11:58,515
I-I talked to New York.

205
00:11:58,565 --> 00:12:01,485
And... you're not.

206
00:12:01,526 --> 00:12:03,196
So much.

207
00:12:03,236 --> 00:12:04,236
Leaving.

208
00:12:05,822 --> 00:12:07,412
What?

209
00:12:07,449 --> 00:12:10,989
They didn't share details.

210
00:12:11,036 --> 00:12:13,956
But hey, look...

211
00:12:13,997 --> 00:12:18,287
the boys in marketing have
created a primo tag for you:

212
00:12:18,335 --> 00:12:20,995
The Savior of Sandusky!

213
00:12:22,547 --> 00:12:24,927
That has a nice ring,
doesn't it?

214
00:12:59,626 --> 00:13:01,166
William.

215
00:13:04,506 --> 00:13:06,756
What are you looking at
out there?

216
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,390
Eastern meadowlarks.

217
00:13:08,427 --> 00:13:12,677
It was either bird-watching
or alcoholism, so...

218
00:13:12,723 --> 00:13:14,433
birds.

219
00:13:14,474 --> 00:13:15,894
I thought we agreed that you

220
00:13:15,934 --> 00:13:18,274
were never going
to come out here.

221
00:13:18,311 --> 00:13:21,111
Yeah, well,
you taught me a thing or two

222
00:13:21,148 --> 00:13:24,108
about broken promises.

223
00:13:24,151 --> 00:13:26,281
Didn't you?

224
00:13:27,612 --> 00:13:29,612
This is Hugh Campbell.

225
00:13:30,907 --> 00:13:33,327
We're working
with M.M. and Frenchie.

226
00:13:33,368 --> 00:13:35,408
I got the Boys back together.

227
00:13:35,454 --> 00:13:36,794
Grace Mallory.

228
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:39,250
I'm the founder
of your little club.

229
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:42,341
- You're, uh...
- So, let me hear it.

230
00:13:44,838 --> 00:13:47,008
I need your help.

231
00:13:47,049 --> 00:13:48,679
Sorry, I can't.

232
00:13:48,717 --> 00:13:52,137
I'm hoping to photograph
a snowy owl in the dunes.

233
00:13:54,181 --> 00:13:55,931
Look...

234
00:13:55,974 --> 00:13:58,734
I didn't want to come here,

235
00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:01,309
but I need your help.

236
00:14:01,354 --> 00:14:04,154
And you're going to
fucking help.

237
00:14:04,191 --> 00:14:05,981
Why's that?

238
00:14:12,824 --> 00:14:15,704
Because you owe me.

239
00:14:15,744 --> 00:14:18,214
You fucking owe me, goddamn it.

240
00:15:15,053 --> 00:15:16,103
Look at you, mon coeur.

241
00:15:18,306 --> 00:15:20,176
Run! Run!

242
00:15:48,336 --> 00:15:50,296
Who's got eyes on her?

243
00:15:50,338 --> 00:15:52,838
Over here!

244
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,890
Good job.

245
00:16:02,934 --> 00:16:05,484
We won't let her get away.

246
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:09,792
This is Alpha Team.

247
00:16:09,816 --> 00:16:12,146
Suspect is in custody.

248
00:16:12,194 --> 00:16:14,654
There's simply nothing
else to say. I can't help you.

249
00:16:14,696 --> 00:16:16,299
Well, you're gonna have to do
better than that.

250
00:16:16,323 --> 00:16:19,663
- Do I? Why?
- 'Cause you made me a promise.

251
00:16:19,701 --> 00:16:21,541
But then my grandchildren
got incinerated.

252
00:16:21,578 --> 00:16:24,118
Tends to change
one's perspective.

253
00:16:24,164 --> 00:16:25,624
There weren't even teeth left,

254
00:16:25,665 --> 00:16:28,585
Lamplighter had burnt them alive
so thoroughly.

255
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:32,759
Well,

256
00:16:32,797 --> 00:16:36,717
I think I've had
enough sun for one day.

257
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,930
Pleasure meeting you, Hugh.

258
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:40,390
Butcher.

259
00:16:42,224 --> 00:16:44,184
Well, what about
what you've done?

260
00:16:44,226 --> 00:16:45,636
What I've done?

261
00:16:46,686 --> 00:16:48,516
To who?

262
00:16:50,774 --> 00:16:54,364
To me, goddamn it. To me.

263
00:16:54,402 --> 00:16:56,362
You trained me up,
manipulated me,

264
00:16:56,404 --> 00:16:58,824
aimed me at Homelander
like a fucking howitzer.

265
00:16:58,865 --> 00:17:02,405
And then when it didn't suit you
anymore, you just threw me away.

266
00:17:02,452 --> 00:17:04,872
And not a day goes by
I don't regret it.

267
00:17:04,913 --> 00:17:07,083
Day late, dollar short, love.

268
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:12,880
Now, I'm going to finish
what you started,

269
00:17:12,921 --> 00:17:14,921
and I need your help.

270
00:17:18,551 --> 00:17:20,551
Please.

271
00:17:26,851 --> 00:17:29,731
You can leave with something,

272
00:17:29,771 --> 00:17:32,021
if you never come back

273
00:17:32,065 --> 00:17:34,685
and you keep your
goddamn promise this time.

274
00:17:38,697 --> 00:17:40,197
Madelyn Stillwell.

275
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,990
Vought's VP?

276
00:17:42,033 --> 00:17:43,636
- Homelander's her main account.
- Yeah, that ain't news.

277
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:46,620
No, but this is:

278
00:17:46,663 --> 00:17:48,923
They have a...
what shall we say?

279
00:17:48,957 --> 00:17:51,377
a very special relationship.

280
00:17:51,418 --> 00:17:53,998
Complicated, intimate,
hard to quantify.

281
00:17:54,045 --> 00:17:55,545
And you know this how?

282
00:17:55,588 --> 00:17:57,968
Still have a few fingers
in a few pies.

283
00:17:58,008 --> 00:18:00,138
I don't know
if Homelander has a weakness,

284
00:18:00,176 --> 00:18:03,306
but if he does, she'll know it.

285
00:18:08,935 --> 00:18:11,895
Good-bye, Grace.

286
00:18:11,938 --> 00:18:14,568
You want to kill yourself,
that's your right...

287
00:18:14,607 --> 00:18:19,237
I won't stop you...
but, Billy, not the others.

288
00:18:22,032 --> 00:18:24,452
Vengeance isn't a path
to glory, Hugh.

289
00:18:24,492 --> 00:18:27,332
It's a one-way ticket
to a dead end,

290
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:30,750
looking at fucking birds.

291
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:41,550
Oh... No, go ahead.

292
00:18:41,593 --> 00:18:43,473
Sure.

293
00:19:11,498 --> 00:19:14,288
Dude. Dude, it's A-Train.

294
00:19:14,334 --> 00:19:15,544
Really?

295
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,420
It's fucking A-Train.

296
00:19:21,466 --> 00:19:23,126
Can I help you?

297
00:19:23,176 --> 00:19:24,716
I'm just keeping an eye out.

298
00:19:25,887 --> 00:19:28,007
That's funny, um,

299
00:19:28,056 --> 00:19:31,766
it really looks like you're
only keeping an eye on me.

300
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:33,900
You know I'm A-Train, right?

301
00:19:33,937 --> 00:19:37,187
Yeah, and I'm Homelander.

302
00:19:37,232 --> 00:19:39,072
Dude, whip back to A-Train.

303
00:19:41,277 --> 00:19:42,987
Oh.

304
00:19:43,029 --> 00:19:45,239
Listen, I'm sorry about that.

305
00:19:45,281 --> 00:19:46,661
We're good.

306
00:19:46,699 --> 00:19:49,289
Oh. Wait, so now that you...

307
00:19:49,327 --> 00:19:51,997
now you know I'm A-Train,
now we're good?

308
00:19:52,038 --> 00:19:55,328
Listen, man, I'm sorry.
It was my mistake.

309
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:58,375
Yeah, you're damn right
it's your mistake.

310
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,800
I'm A-Train.

311
00:19:59,838 --> 00:20:02,548
I'm the fastest
fucking man alive!

312
00:20:04,968 --> 00:20:08,348
What are you all
fucking looking at?

313
00:20:14,811 --> 00:20:17,061
- You missed it.
- Eyes front.

314
00:20:17,105 --> 00:20:19,105
Eyes fucking front, Hughie.

315
00:20:19,149 --> 00:20:21,109
- Boys are gone.
- What?

316
00:20:21,151 --> 00:20:22,691
Someone's grabbed them.

317
00:20:22,735 --> 00:20:24,695
Oh, yeah? How do you know that?

318
00:20:24,737 --> 00:20:26,607
The window's new,
the front path is scrubbed,

319
00:20:26,656 --> 00:20:28,656
and there's a black van
with "Flowers" on it,

320
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,620
probably full of cunts
waiting to jump us.

321
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,040
- Vought?
- Nah, someone else doing

322
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:34,329
their dirty work for them,

323
00:20:34,372 --> 00:20:36,792
probably some
Fed black ops unit.

324
00:20:42,589 --> 00:20:44,969
Okay. Okay, what are we...
what-what are we gonna do?

325
00:20:45,008 --> 00:20:46,798
How are we gonna get
the guys back?

326
00:20:46,843 --> 00:20:49,223
We're on our own.
We've got to get to Stillwell

327
00:20:49,262 --> 00:20:51,740
- before the walls close in.
- Who gives a fuck about Stillwell?

328
00:20:51,764 --> 00:20:53,617
- We have to go back for them.
- You don't get it, Hughie.

329
00:20:53,641 --> 00:20:55,691
We got about a couple hours
before they find us,

330
00:20:55,727 --> 00:20:57,017
and that's if we're lucky.

331
00:20:57,061 --> 00:20:59,731
We got to hit back
and hit back now.

332
00:20:59,772 --> 00:21:01,232
You're abandoning them.

333
00:21:01,274 --> 00:21:04,324
I mean, they all...
they risked their...

334
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,360
Mother's Milk has a daughter.

335
00:21:06,404 --> 00:21:07,631
They'd want us
to finish the job.

336
00:21:07,655 --> 00:21:09,865
Your job.

337
00:21:09,908 --> 00:21:13,408
Your job, not theirs.

338
00:21:13,453 --> 00:21:15,833
It's all about Homelander,
isn't it?

339
00:21:15,872 --> 00:21:19,132
And A-Train. This is your
fucking shit, too, Hughie.

340
00:21:19,167 --> 00:21:21,127
I promised you payback,
didn't I?

341
00:21:22,545 --> 00:21:24,835
Mallory give you the same speech
back in the day?

342
00:21:24,881 --> 00:21:26,221
Yeah. Yeah, she did.

343
00:21:26,257 --> 00:21:28,587
But she broke her promise.

344
00:21:28,635 --> 00:21:30,215
I'm keeping mine.

345
00:21:32,388 --> 00:21:34,468
I'm so fucking stupid.

346
00:21:36,684 --> 00:21:38,194
You never cared about me.

347
00:21:38,228 --> 00:21:40,558
Or Robin, did you?

348
00:21:40,605 --> 00:21:43,395
I was just useful to you.

349
00:21:43,441 --> 00:21:45,821
Fuck, Hughie.
Of course you're useful.

350
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,240
I mean, that's why you're here,
isn't it?

351
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:52,779
Now we just got to take
one more step.

352
00:21:52,825 --> 00:21:54,785
Yeah?

353
00:21:54,827 --> 00:21:56,787
Come on.

354
00:21:56,829 --> 00:21:58,749
No.

355
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:01,330
We have to save them.

356
00:22:01,376 --> 00:22:03,496
For fuck's sakes, Hughie,
we don't have time

357
00:22:03,545 --> 00:22:05,505
for this shit right now, okay?

358
00:22:05,547 --> 00:22:08,337
We get Stillwell.
Now, get in the fucking car.

359
00:22:08,383 --> 00:22:10,343
Then what?

360
00:22:10,385 --> 00:22:12,715
Becca comes back from the dead?
Robin, too?

361
00:22:12,762 --> 00:22:15,602
This is never gonna stop...
it's just gonna be more blood

362
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,850
and... awfulness.

363
00:22:19,727 --> 00:22:21,687
That's the fucking game.

364
00:22:21,729 --> 00:22:25,109
If you don't like to play, why
did you join the fucking team?

365
00:22:26,901 --> 00:22:29,381
Mallory's right... you're just
gonna drag us all down with you.

366
00:22:30,613 --> 00:22:32,873
Not me.

367
00:22:32,907 --> 00:22:34,737
Not anymore.

368
00:22:37,662 --> 00:22:40,462
You're a fucking pathetic cunt

369
00:22:40,498 --> 00:22:43,078
and an insult to Robin's memory.

370
00:22:44,335 --> 00:22:46,625
I think I'm doing this for her.

371
00:22:51,342 --> 00:22:53,342
Good-bye, Hughie.

372
00:23:35,803 --> 00:23:37,433
Fucking idiot.

373
00:23:39,932 --> 00:23:41,932
Stupid fucker.

374
00:23:50,568 --> 00:23:52,068
Fuck.

375
00:23:53,321 --> 00:23:55,321
Idiot.

376
00:24:05,667 --> 00:24:07,627
Fuck.

377
00:24:07,669 --> 00:24:09,999
Stupid fucking idiot.

378
00:25:02,014 --> 00:25:05,274
I remember you telling me
you like to come here to listen

379
00:25:05,309 --> 00:25:08,269
to the choir rehearse,
so I, I figured I'd take a shot.

380
00:25:08,312 --> 00:25:10,022
You've got a lot of balls.

381
00:25:10,064 --> 00:25:12,404
Just two.

382
00:25:12,442 --> 00:25:15,782
I mean, you must want me
to arrest you.

383
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:18,910
Actually, uh...

384
00:25:20,616 --> 00:25:25,286
Annie... I need your help.

385
00:25:34,297 --> 00:25:35,627
- Please just listen to me.
- Why?

386
00:25:35,673 --> 00:25:37,683
More awful secrets
you want to tell me,

387
00:25:37,717 --> 00:25:39,677
more drugs that I was dosed
with as a kid, maybe?

388
00:25:39,719 --> 00:25:41,469
Look, that just came out.
I'm sorry.

389
00:25:41,512 --> 00:25:43,198
I-I thought you... maybe
you wanted to know the truth.

390
00:25:43,222 --> 00:25:45,392
Oh, okay, so you're
all about the truth.

391
00:25:45,433 --> 00:25:48,233
Vought is giving Compound V
to some bad fucking people,

392
00:25:48,269 --> 00:25:49,649
like really bad.

393
00:25:49,687 --> 00:25:51,687
Like, that Supe terrorist.

394
00:25:53,107 --> 00:25:55,067
That's insane.

395
00:25:55,109 --> 00:25:57,109
No, it's true.

396
00:25:57,153 --> 00:25:59,323
Look, my friends want to stop
it, but they got caught

397
00:25:59,363 --> 00:26:01,953
on Vought's orders,
and I, and I figured,

398
00:26:01,991 --> 00:26:05,411
because you had
security clearance,

399
00:26:05,453 --> 00:26:07,503
maybe you could help find them.

400
00:26:09,957 --> 00:26:13,537
Hughie, I was almost arrested
just for knowing you.

401
00:26:13,586 --> 00:26:16,546
I had to convince them that I
was an idiot that you threw out

402
00:26:16,589 --> 00:26:18,379
and you used,
and now you want me

403
00:26:18,424 --> 00:26:20,934
to help
your psycho killer friends?

404
00:26:20,968 --> 00:26:23,928
When you put it like that...

405
00:26:23,971 --> 00:26:28,271
You have 30 seconds
to get the hell out of here.

406
00:26:31,437 --> 00:26:34,017
Okay.

407
00:26:34,065 --> 00:26:36,065
I'm sorry to bother you.

408
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,860
I mean, why the hell

409
00:26:39,904 --> 00:26:42,914
would I ever help you?

410
00:26:47,411 --> 00:26:50,121
Because Vought's up
to some evil shit?

411
00:26:52,208 --> 00:26:54,588
'Cause it's your job.

412
00:26:56,629 --> 00:26:58,839
Because you're a superhero.

413
00:26:58,881 --> 00:27:00,881
Really?

414
00:27:03,135 --> 00:27:06,345
I can't remember the last time
I saved anyone.

415
00:27:06,389 --> 00:27:07,809
You saved me.

416
00:27:07,849 --> 00:27:10,769
When did I ever save you?

417
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,020
Bowling alley.

418
00:27:16,065 --> 00:27:19,275
What are you talking about?

419
00:27:22,572 --> 00:27:25,742
I was, I was angry after Robin.

420
00:27:25,783 --> 00:27:31,373
I was headed for this cliff, and
then you and me went bowling.

421
00:27:33,249 --> 00:27:34,629
Bowling?

422
00:27:34,667 --> 00:27:36,627
Yeah.

423
00:27:36,669 --> 00:27:38,629
Bowling.

424
00:27:38,671 --> 00:27:40,591
That's it.

425
00:27:40,631 --> 00:27:45,301
That's not saving you,
that's, that's just being there.

426
00:27:52,018 --> 00:27:54,018
The thing is...

427
00:28:02,987 --> 00:28:04,987
...I don't care.

428
00:28:33,726 --> 00:28:36,476
Hey!

429
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,940
What the hell are you doing?

430
00:28:38,981 --> 00:28:41,781
Doc said six weeks minimum
after a fracture like that.

431
00:28:41,817 --> 00:28:43,647
I'm all good, man.

432
00:28:43,694 --> 00:28:45,404
Look, I'm back to training.

433
00:28:45,446 --> 00:28:47,696
I feel fucking great.

434
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,120
- You're healed?
- I'm healed.

435
00:28:49,158 --> 00:28:51,198
How the fuck are you hea...

436
00:28:52,828 --> 00:28:55,248
You back on that Compound V.

437
00:28:55,289 --> 00:28:57,392
You promised me that you would stay clean.

438
00:28:57,416 --> 00:28:59,416
No. I am clean.

439
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,710
A-1, all-natural A-Train, baby.

440
00:29:01,754 --> 00:29:05,344
Your fucking bones fused back
together overnight?

441
00:29:05,383 --> 00:29:08,143
- That sound natural to you?
- Maybe I'm just strong.

442
00:29:08,177 --> 00:29:11,597
- Oh, yeah.
- I am the world's fastest man.

443
00:29:14,934 --> 00:29:16,814
Bet you can't outrun this.

444
00:29:16,852 --> 00:29:19,812
Hey. Wait, hey, where you going?

445
00:29:19,855 --> 00:29:23,025
I'm not gonna sit here
and watch you kill yourself.

446
00:29:23,067 --> 00:29:27,657
You know what?
I don't need this shit.

447
00:29:27,697 --> 00:29:30,657
You've always just been jealous
of me, so go ahead,

448
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,950
slow-ass fucking loser.

449
00:30:08,904 --> 00:30:12,914
Huh... I'm just, yeah, I'm just
gonna...

450
00:30:24,712 --> 00:30:26,512
- There he is!
- Our hero.

451
00:30:28,507 --> 00:30:31,927
Stop it.

452
00:30:31,969 --> 00:30:33,599
Stop, please.

453
00:30:42,104 --> 00:30:45,524
Amazing. Great job, everybody.

454
00:30:45,566 --> 00:30:47,294
- You're gonna make me blush here.
- Madelyn?

455
00:30:47,318 --> 00:30:50,068
- Stop, please.
- Mr. Edgar.

456
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:52,742
Uh, I, uh, I didn't know
you were gonna come.

457
00:30:52,782 --> 00:30:54,702
Let me borrow you for a moment.

458
00:31:08,464 --> 00:31:10,844
The Pentagon's shelling out
north of $40 billion per year.

459
00:31:10,883 --> 00:31:13,093
You should enjoy a bonus
that reflects that.

460
00:31:14,303 --> 00:31:16,513
I-I don't know what to say.

461
00:31:16,555 --> 00:31:17,925
Well, say thank you.

462
00:31:17,973 --> 00:31:20,353
Thank you.

463
00:31:20,392 --> 00:31:22,352
Don't get too excited.

464
00:31:22,394 --> 00:31:23,984
It comes with strings.

465
00:31:24,021 --> 00:31:26,151
You're gonna need to move
your office down to 82.

466
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:28,150
- That's your floor.
- And

467
00:31:28,192 --> 00:31:30,952
I'm gonna want you to start
riding shotgun on my meetings.

468
00:31:30,986 --> 00:31:32,986
Hey, don't go planning
my retirement yet.

469
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:35,120
I'm just saying, someone
needs to run this shit show

470
00:31:35,157 --> 00:31:37,737
when I move to Belize.

471
00:31:37,785 --> 00:31:39,365
Enjoy yourself, Madelyn.

472
00:31:39,411 --> 00:31:42,671
Start thinking
about the view from 82.

473
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:46,343
Thank you.

474
00:31:56,679 --> 00:32:00,809
Electricity goes in,
blast comes out.

475
00:32:04,812 --> 00:32:06,982
That's a hell of a party trick.

476
00:32:07,022 --> 00:32:10,692
Do you ever, um, use it for fun?

477
00:32:10,734 --> 00:32:14,324
Can I tell you a secret?

478
00:32:14,363 --> 00:32:18,993
Sometimes,
my eyes light up when I...

479
00:32:19,034 --> 00:32:20,414
you know.

480
00:32:27,459 --> 00:32:29,129
- Will you excuse me?
- Uh...

481
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:31,420
Just a second.

482
00:32:46,478 --> 00:32:49,268
You want me to hold your hair back?

483
00:32:49,315 --> 00:32:51,435
Don't touch.

484
00:32:52,735 --> 00:32:54,605
Leave me alone,
I'm not in the mood.

485
00:32:54,653 --> 00:32:56,363
Not in the mood for what?

486
00:32:57,489 --> 00:33:01,119
Your bottomless casual cruelty.

487
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,910
So just make
whatever shitty comment

488
00:33:02,953 --> 00:33:04,663
you're gonna make and then go.

489
00:33:12,379 --> 00:33:14,219
Look.

490
00:33:16,508 --> 00:33:18,298
What am I supposed to be
looking at?

491
00:33:18,344 --> 00:33:22,474
No... my radius
never healed straight.

492
00:33:25,517 --> 00:33:28,727
I really did break every bone
in my right arm.

493
00:33:28,771 --> 00:33:31,481
- What?
- Stopping the bus from falling.

494
00:33:31,523 --> 00:33:33,733
You said the marketing guys
made it up.

495
00:33:35,736 --> 00:33:37,106
It was me.

496
00:33:38,656 --> 00:33:40,696
23-year-old, bright-eyed,

497
00:33:40,741 --> 00:33:43,201
ass you could bounce
a quarter off of...

498
00:33:43,244 --> 00:33:44,704
me.

499
00:33:48,958 --> 00:33:51,628
I really did want
to make a difference.

500
00:33:51,669 --> 00:33:53,299
I really did care.

501
00:33:55,297 --> 00:33:56,757
I was just like you.

502
00:33:58,634 --> 00:34:00,304
And then...

503
00:34:00,344 --> 00:34:04,144
I started giving pieces
of myself away and...

504
00:34:04,181 --> 00:34:06,931
I guess I gave away everything.

505
00:34:15,025 --> 00:34:16,735
So you know what? Be...

506
00:34:16,777 --> 00:34:19,357
just be original.

507
00:34:19,405 --> 00:34:21,405
For fuck's sake.

508
00:34:22,491 --> 00:34:25,121
My position is already taken.

509
00:34:29,873 --> 00:34:33,423
Be the annoying goody two-shoes
asshole that you are.

510
00:34:35,963 --> 00:34:38,263
One of us has to be.

511
00:35:09,038 --> 00:35:11,208
You've been avoiding me.

512
00:35:11,248 --> 00:35:13,628
- No, I haven't.
- Really?

513
00:35:13,667 --> 00:35:15,667
Seems that way.

514
00:35:17,546 --> 00:35:20,376
You do know that I went to see
Vogelbaum, though...

515
00:35:20,424 --> 00:35:22,094
right?

516
00:35:24,136 --> 00:35:26,676
And you do know what he told me?

517
00:35:26,722 --> 00:35:29,182
I never meant for you
to find out that way.

518
00:35:29,224 --> 00:35:31,774
Let me guess.
You wanted to protect me.

519
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:33,980
Well, we all did.

520
00:35:34,021 --> 00:35:35,941
Of course.

521
00:35:37,941 --> 00:35:39,191
You think I'm fragile?

522
00:35:39,234 --> 00:35:40,824
No, I do not.

523
00:35:40,861 --> 00:35:42,651
You try doing any of this...

524
00:35:42,696 --> 00:35:45,776
I mean fucking any of it...

525
00:35:45,824 --> 00:35:48,164
without me...

526
00:35:48,202 --> 00:35:50,122
I couldn't.

527
00:35:50,162 --> 00:35:51,832
Madelyn.

528
00:35:54,083 --> 00:35:57,633
Did it ever occur to you that...

529
00:35:57,669 --> 00:36:00,129
a Supe terrorist showing up

530
00:36:00,172 --> 00:36:03,552
exactly when
we needed him to was...

531
00:36:03,592 --> 00:36:06,222
a pretty fucking
incredible coincidence?

532
00:36:08,263 --> 00:36:10,313
It's almost like...

533
00:36:10,349 --> 00:36:12,599
someone planned it.

534
00:36:13,811 --> 00:36:16,691
Mm-hmm.

535
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,360
Me.

536
00:36:23,612 --> 00:36:25,362
Me.

537
00:36:25,406 --> 00:36:26,696
I made him.

538
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:30,540
What do you mean you "made him"?

539
00:36:30,577 --> 00:36:34,417
Well, I borrowed
some Compound V,

540
00:36:34,456 --> 00:36:37,126
had A-Train run it
all over the globe,

541
00:36:37,167 --> 00:36:40,047
and I supercharged some jihadis.

542
00:36:42,798 --> 00:36:44,758
Uh, not to oversimplify it.

543
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,319
I mean, it-it was actually
very difficult

544
00:36:46,343 --> 00:36:49,103
and very messy,
using adult subjects.

545
00:36:49,138 --> 00:36:51,428
There's a good reason
that Vought doesn't do it.

546
00:36:51,473 --> 00:36:54,183
But... well, enough survived

547
00:36:54,226 --> 00:36:57,976
to call the operation
a huge success.

548
00:36:59,022 --> 00:37:01,572
Huge.

549
00:37:01,608 --> 00:37:03,488
And now...

550
00:37:03,527 --> 00:37:08,697
we have villains
all over the globe...

551
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:11,620
that only we can fight.

552
00:37:12,619 --> 00:37:16,209
In sequel after sequel...

553
00:37:16,248 --> 00:37:18,128
after sequel.

554
00:37:22,546 --> 00:37:24,966
Well?

555
00:37:27,509 --> 00:37:29,049
Say something.

556
00:37:51,366 --> 00:37:53,286
No.

557
00:37:56,121 --> 00:37:58,041
Take off your pants.

558
00:38:13,805 --> 00:38:15,265
Sit down.

559
00:38:42,125 --> 00:38:43,585
- Gentle.
- I'm...

560
00:38:46,129 --> 00:38:47,669
No.

561
00:38:54,846 --> 00:38:57,516
Oh, my sweet boy.

562
00:38:57,558 --> 00:39:01,768
My special, special, sweet boy.

563
00:39:04,398 --> 00:39:06,438
I'm gonna take care of you.

564
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:14,780
I'm sorry.

565
00:39:14,825 --> 00:39:16,865
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

566
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:19,250
- No, you did good.
- I'm sorry.

567
00:39:19,288 --> 00:39:21,578
Oh, my boy.

568
00:39:21,623 --> 00:39:24,133
I'm proud of you.

569
00:39:24,167 --> 00:39:26,207
That was so lovely.

570
00:39:29,381 --> 00:39:32,381
Well, you know,
in, uh, medieval times,

571
00:39:32,426 --> 00:39:34,756
they locked prisoners
inside a pillory barrel.

572
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,116
Then they'd kneel
in their own excrement

573
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:40,850
till they got sepsis
and died, so...

574
00:39:42,019 --> 00:39:44,649
Thank you, Frenchie,

575
00:39:44,688 --> 00:39:48,358
for that disgusting
yet fascinating piece of trivia.

576
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,490
I'm just saying
it could be worse, huh?

577
00:39:50,527 --> 00:39:51,987
Right.

578
00:39:58,452 --> 00:40:00,582
Why didn't you tell us?

579
00:40:00,621 --> 00:40:03,121
Tell you what?

580
00:40:03,165 --> 00:40:04,955
That you had a daughter.

581
00:40:08,962 --> 00:40:11,422
I don't know.

582
00:40:11,465 --> 00:40:12,915
I mean...

583
00:40:14,926 --> 00:40:16,596
I guess she's...

584
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:20,929
...the only good thing
I ever did, man.

585
00:40:23,226 --> 00:40:26,306
I just wanted just to leave her
clean out of it, you know?

586
00:40:28,315 --> 00:40:30,525
But I fucked that up
to high heaven.

587
00:40:32,944 --> 00:40:34,494
Probably never see her again.

588
00:40:34,529 --> 00:40:36,529
I understand.

589
00:40:39,368 --> 00:40:40,948
She made you a better person.

590
00:40:46,541 --> 00:40:49,381
Hey, man.

591
00:40:49,419 --> 00:40:51,339
Kimiko's gonna be okay.

592
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:56,390
So you do know her name.

593
00:40:56,426 --> 00:40:58,136
- Hmm.
- Do you like that?

594
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:02,020
No.

595
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:06,768
Um...

596
00:41:06,812 --> 00:41:09,232
Mr. Edgar came
to the party tonight

597
00:41:09,272 --> 00:41:12,822
and he practically
offered me his job.

598
00:41:12,859 --> 00:41:14,489
Well, not right away.

599
00:41:14,528 --> 00:41:16,408
But he, um...

600
00:41:16,446 --> 00:41:18,066
wants me to move
to the 82nd floor

601
00:41:18,115 --> 00:41:19,695
so that I can be closer to him.

602
00:41:19,741 --> 00:41:21,331
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

603
00:41:21,368 --> 00:41:24,748
Okay, but y-you'll still be
my day-to-day, right?

604
00:41:24,788 --> 00:41:26,998
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

605
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,960
Of course.

606
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,670
I will be there for you always.

607
00:41:31,712 --> 00:41:33,422
Okay, good.

608
00:41:36,299 --> 00:41:37,799
Good.

609
00:41:39,845 --> 00:41:41,715
Madelyn.

610
00:41:41,763 --> 00:41:43,223
From now on,

611
00:41:43,265 --> 00:41:45,425
no more secrets.

612
00:41:47,436 --> 00:41:49,016
Promise me.

613
00:41:49,062 --> 00:41:51,692
I promise.

614
00:41:51,732 --> 00:41:53,322
No more secrets.

615
00:41:54,359 --> 00:41:56,149
Okay.

616
00:41:59,614 --> 00:42:02,704
I'm sorry that I didn't
tell you about your baby.

617
00:42:04,828 --> 00:42:06,248
It's just that...

618
00:42:06,288 --> 00:42:09,118
you carry so much, and...

619
00:42:11,168 --> 00:42:13,998
...the pain of losing
a child to...

620
00:42:14,045 --> 00:42:16,085
miscarriage is...

621
00:42:18,175 --> 00:42:20,385
I just wanted
to spare you that burden.

622
00:42:20,427 --> 00:42:22,677
Do you understand?

623
00:42:22,721 --> 00:42:24,721
Yes.

624
00:42:52,292 --> 00:42:53,672
What the fuck?!

625
00:43:03,345 --> 00:43:05,406
Hey, easy with him, man.

626
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:08,430
Fuck wrong with you? Shit.

627
00:43:08,475 --> 00:43:11,345
Bitch ass.

628
00:43:11,394 --> 00:43:12,774
You okay? You break any bones?

629
00:43:12,813 --> 00:43:14,153
- No, no. No.
- No?

630
00:43:14,189 --> 00:43:15,519
Did they get Butcher, too?

631
00:43:15,565 --> 00:43:17,645
- No.
- They got you separated?

632
00:43:17,692 --> 00:43:19,152
When? When?

633
00:43:19,194 --> 00:43:20,534
Well, um,

634
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:22,610
he went after Homelander.

635
00:43:22,656 --> 00:43:23,906
But I...

636
00:43:23,949 --> 00:43:26,199
I came to save you.

637
00:43:26,243 --> 00:43:29,083
Yay.

638
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:32,420
So, you came here?
You meant to come here?

639
00:43:32,457 --> 00:43:34,327
- Without Butcher.
- Yeah.

640
00:43:35,377 --> 00:43:37,207
C'est incroyable.

641
00:43:38,922 --> 00:43:40,342
Oh...

642
00:43:42,342 --> 00:43:44,552
Never has a man
thrown his life away so...

643
00:43:44,594 --> 00:43:46,405
completely like
you've thrown yours away today.

644
00:43:46,429 --> 00:43:48,309
No...

645
00:43:48,348 --> 00:43:50,978
no, what I mean is,
you rescuing us

646
00:43:51,017 --> 00:43:54,187
is the most useless,
futile gesture I can think of.

647
00:43:54,229 --> 00:43:56,109
- Yeah, I-I got it.
- Unbelievable.

648
00:43:56,147 --> 00:43:57,897
- All right, so what's the plan?
- Okay.

649
00:43:57,941 --> 00:43:59,531
Okay, um...

650
00:43:59,568 --> 00:44:01,108
all right, so they searched me.

651
00:44:01,152 --> 00:44:03,242
Very, very thoroughly.

652
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,830
But I managed to Poligrip
in my 12th grade retainer.

653
00:44:06,867 --> 00:44:08,386
- Let me see.
- So it looks like a permanent bridge,

654
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:10,370
- and it totally worked.
- Shit.

655
00:44:10,412 --> 00:44:12,306
Frenchie, you can pick a lock
with anything, right?

656
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:14,642
There's premium metal wire in this thing.

657
00:44:14,666 --> 00:44:17,036
- Come on, take it out.
- Okay, one second.

658
00:44:17,085 --> 00:44:19,835
Come on, man.
Spit that bitch out.

659
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:21,880
It's stuck.

660
00:44:21,923 --> 00:44:23,723
- Okay, okay, stand still.
- Wait, what?

661
00:44:23,758 --> 00:44:25,138
- Stand still. Open.
- What...

662
00:44:25,176 --> 00:44:27,716
Open the mouth...

663
00:44:27,762 --> 00:44:29,352
Come on, get up in there,
Frenchie.

664
00:44:30,849 --> 00:44:33,059
Just go deeper.
Just a little deeper.

665
00:44:33,101 --> 00:44:34,120
All right, all right, all right,
h-h-hold...

666
00:44:34,144 --> 00:44:35,314
whoa, whoa, whoa.

667
00:44:35,353 --> 00:44:36,563
What the fuck, man?

668
00:44:36,605 --> 00:44:38,395
Let me get this.
Let me get this.

669
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,360
Relax, okay?

670
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,530
- Look. Look, focus. Focus.
- Okay, okay. What?

671
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:44,881
I'm-a knock that bitch
out your mouth.

672
00:44:44,905 --> 00:44:46,695
- Okay?
- We're not at that step yet.

673
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:48,217
We don't have to do that.

674
00:44:48,241 --> 00:44:49,635
It's just gonna sting
a little bit. A'ight?

675
00:44:49,659 --> 00:44:51,159
- Sting?
- On three.

676
00:44:51,202 --> 00:44:53,014
- One to three.
- Okay, well, if you count down...

677
00:44:53,038 --> 00:44:55,458
You all right?

678
00:44:55,498 --> 00:44:56,828
You okay, buddy?

679
00:44:56,875 --> 00:44:58,785
- Yes.
- Yes!

680
00:44:58,835 --> 00:45:00,855
Good job, Hughie.

681
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:24,950
Good night, Ms. Stillwell.

682
00:45:24,986 --> 00:45:26,356
Good night, Miles.

683
00:45:27,948 --> 00:45:29,818
Maria.

684
00:45:33,703 --> 00:45:35,963
Maria, I'm home.

685
00:45:38,959 --> 00:45:40,459
Maria?

686
00:45:40,502 --> 00:45:42,592
Your kid's a sound sleeper.

687
00:45:51,513 --> 00:45:53,103
Don't worry.

688
00:45:53,139 --> 00:45:55,269
He's all right.

689
00:45:55,308 --> 00:45:56,978
So's the nanny.

690
00:45:57,018 --> 00:45:59,898
She's out the back sleeping off
a little bit of propofol.

691
00:46:02,941 --> 00:46:04,531
Put your phone on the table.

692
00:46:20,542 --> 00:46:22,382
William Butcher.

693
00:46:24,921 --> 00:46:27,131
CIA showed me your file.

694
00:46:29,175 --> 00:46:31,255
- What do you want?
- You know what I want.

695
00:46:31,302 --> 00:46:33,722
I don't know how
breaking into my home

696
00:46:33,763 --> 00:46:36,733
and threatening my child
is gonna get you Homelander.

697
00:46:36,766 --> 00:46:38,266
All these years...

698
00:46:38,309 --> 00:46:40,729
I've been searching
for that cunt's weakness.

699
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:42,730
He doesn't have any weakness.

700
00:46:42,772 --> 00:46:45,232
- No?
- There isn't a weapon on Earth

701
00:46:45,275 --> 00:46:47,235
that they haven't thrown at him.

702
00:46:47,277 --> 00:46:48,817
They've all failed.

703
00:46:48,862 --> 00:46:51,072
That's not
what I'm talking about.

704
00:46:52,532 --> 00:46:55,872
I'm talking... about you.

705
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:57,700
Me?

706
00:46:57,746 --> 00:47:01,246
Yeah, you're the only thing
he gives two shits about.

707
00:47:02,792 --> 00:47:04,382
You're his weakness.

708
00:47:12,302 --> 00:47:14,182
It's a fucking maze.

709
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:15,850
Where is she?

710
00:47:21,061 --> 00:47:23,101
Ready... go on.

711
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:33,201
Mon coeur.

712
00:47:33,239 --> 00:47:34,989
Frenchie, what the fuck?

713
00:47:51,633 --> 00:47:53,683
Fuck! Move. Move.

714
00:48:05,814 --> 00:48:07,364
Fuck.

715
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:14,200
- No! God.
- Just stay down.

716
00:48:22,539 --> 00:48:24,919
Aw, fuck.

717
00:48:24,958 --> 00:48:26,998
She better be fucking worth it.

718
00:48:27,043 --> 00:48:28,713
Wait, what?

719
00:48:28,753 --> 00:48:30,423
- You cover him. Cover him!
- Wait, what?

720
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:31,982
No, I don't... I don't...
I can't do this.

721
00:48:32,006 --> 00:48:33,756
You just pull the fucking
trigger right now!

722
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,090
Okay!

723
00:48:36,136 --> 00:48:38,096
Sorry! I'm sorry!

724
00:48:41,057 --> 00:48:42,597
Shit, it's out, it's out.
What do I do?

725
00:48:42,642 --> 00:48:44,602
Take this. Take it.

726
00:48:44,644 --> 00:48:46,413
- Reload.
- What the fuck do I know about reloading?

727
00:48:46,437 --> 00:48:48,107
Reload the magazine.

728
00:48:48,148 --> 00:48:50,318
How do I do that? Okay.

729
00:48:50,358 --> 00:48:52,068
- Let's go.
- Good? It's good.

730
00:48:58,324 --> 00:49:01,544
M.M.! M.M.!

731
00:49:06,958 --> 00:49:07,958
M.M.!

732
00:49:10,044 --> 00:49:11,044
Go!

733
00:49:23,224 --> 00:49:26,314
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

734
00:49:26,352 --> 00:49:28,812
I'm out.

735
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:33,419
- Oh, shit. - Drop your weapon!
- Get down!

736
00:49:33,443 --> 00:49:34,795
- Okay, okay, okay. Okay.
- On your knees.

737
00:49:34,819 --> 00:49:36,547
- Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
- On your fucking knees!

738
00:49:36,571 --> 00:49:38,571
Face the wall!

739
00:49:38,615 --> 00:49:41,155
Hands on your heads!

740
00:50:26,246 --> 00:50:28,116
You came.

741
00:50:30,708 --> 00:50:32,708
Like you said...

742
00:50:34,379 --> 00:50:36,879
I'm a fucking superhero.

743
00:50:38,758 --> 00:50:41,888
Come on.

744
00:50:41,928 --> 00:50:43,888
Hughie, check the doors.

745
00:50:45,765 --> 00:50:47,135
Is it working?

746
00:50:47,183 --> 00:50:48,773
- No, no, no, um...
- Fuck.

747
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:51,150
Try this.

748
00:50:51,187 --> 00:50:53,477
Yes.

749
00:50:55,608 --> 00:50:57,211
- Son of a...
- Go, go, go.

750
00:50:57,235 --> 00:51:00,735
- Go. Go, go, go.
- Holy shit.

751
00:51:03,408 --> 00:51:05,368
Oh, shit. Go.

752
00:51:05,410 --> 00:51:08,620
- Hughie, let's go.
- Go! I'll be okay. Go.

753
00:51:14,544 --> 00:51:17,014
Homelander was right.

754
00:51:18,256 --> 00:51:20,836
You are a fucking rat.

755
00:51:23,177 --> 00:51:25,967
Oh, and you're the jailbreaker?

756
00:51:26,014 --> 00:51:28,934
Are you fucking kidding me?

757
00:51:28,975 --> 00:51:31,345
Turn around and walk away,
A-Train.

758
00:51:33,313 --> 00:51:34,733
I got this. Go.

759
00:51:34,772 --> 00:51:37,732
No. I'm the one he wants.

760
00:51:37,775 --> 00:51:39,775
I'm not leaving you.

761
00:51:48,953 --> 00:51:51,913
Please, just go.

762
00:52:53,935 --> 00:52:55,935
Hughie!

763
00:52:55,978 --> 00:52:59,728
You killed the only person
I've ever loved.

764
00:52:59,774 --> 00:53:02,614
I didn't kill her.

765
00:53:06,948 --> 00:53:08,948
I know.

766
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:12,410
I did.

767
00:53:21,295 --> 00:53:23,455
But it was your fault.

768
00:53:46,529 --> 00:53:48,409
Holy shit.

769
00:53:48,448 --> 00:53:50,448
What? What?

770
00:53:51,868 --> 00:53:55,748
I-I think he's having
a heart attack.

771
00:54:02,211 --> 00:54:04,091
Oh, fuck.

772
00:54:04,130 --> 00:54:06,090
All right.

773
00:54:09,218 --> 00:54:12,598
One, two, three.

774
00:54:12,638 --> 00:54:14,598
Call an ambulance.

775
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,560
One...

776
00:54:16,601 --> 00:54:18,771
He'll never stop coming for you.

777
00:54:18,811 --> 00:54:20,941
I know.

778
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:27,650
This is Starlight.

779
00:54:27,695 --> 00:54:30,565
I have a code 78-65.
A-Train is down.

780
00:54:30,615 --> 00:54:33,405
I think he's had a heart attack.

781
00:54:35,495 --> 00:54:37,495
You have to go. I'll take over.

782
00:54:39,499 --> 00:54:41,289
Hughie, go!

783
00:54:41,334 --> 00:54:43,344
Or else you'll get caught.

784
00:55:25,419 --> 00:55:27,879
Well, well, well.

785
00:55:27,922 --> 00:55:30,632
About fucking time.

786
00:55:32,385 --> 00:55:34,885
I know you can see
through the ceiling.

787
00:55:36,138 --> 00:55:39,518
You try to kill me...

788
00:55:39,559 --> 00:55:42,939
and my trigger finger goes soft.

789
00:55:42,979 --> 00:55:48,819
Now... why don't you stop
playing rapey Santa...

790
00:55:48,859 --> 00:55:50,859
and come down and join us?

791
00:55:57,868 --> 00:55:59,658
Take it easy.

792
00:55:59,704 --> 00:56:01,834
We don't want
to upset Teddy, right?

793
00:56:01,872 --> 00:56:03,832
What are you doing?

794
00:56:03,874 --> 00:56:05,544
Hey, look: Mommy.

795
00:56:05,585 --> 00:56:06,535
You all right?

796
00:56:06,586 --> 00:56:08,126
- No.
- Madelyn...

797
00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:09,130
Take him upstairs.

798
00:56:09,171 --> 00:56:11,131
All good. I got it.

799
00:56:11,173 --> 00:56:13,263
I got it.

800
00:56:19,307 --> 00:56:21,267
Billy Butcher.

801
00:56:21,309 --> 00:56:24,349
You don't mind
if I call you Billy, right?

802
00:56:24,395 --> 00:56:26,355
Y-You are
pretty darn impressive.

803
00:56:26,397 --> 00:56:31,237
I mean, especially for,
you know, one of you.

804
00:56:31,277 --> 00:56:35,027
See, even now, most people
standing where-where you are

805
00:56:35,072 --> 00:56:37,622
would be pissing their pants
terrified, but you...

806
00:56:37,658 --> 00:56:43,158
uh, sure, y-your heart's
pounding, but you're not afraid.

807
00:56:44,624 --> 00:56:46,004
It's anger.

808
00:56:46,042 --> 00:56:47,882
That's a new one for me.

809
00:56:47,918 --> 00:56:51,798
Homelander, will you please
take the baby upstairs?

810
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:55,969
All because
of your lovely wife Becca.

811
00:56:56,010 --> 00:56:57,390
Right?

812
00:56:57,428 --> 00:56:59,598
Okay. Let's cut
the bullshit, huh?

813
00:56:59,639 --> 00:57:01,639
You know that we, uh...

814
00:57:01,682 --> 00:57:05,442
Uh, bro, not my fault, okay?

815
00:57:05,478 --> 00:57:08,018
- She came on to me. It happens.
- Will you stop?

816
00:57:08,064 --> 00:57:09,833
You know, it's-it's the fame.
They get crushes.

817
00:57:09,857 --> 00:57:11,397
There's nothing
I can do about it.

818
00:57:11,442 --> 00:57:15,072
But what I will tell you is,
she was a hell of a lay.

819
00:57:15,112 --> 00:57:16,662
Oh!

820
00:57:16,697 --> 00:57:18,657
She came three times, eh?

821
00:57:18,699 --> 00:57:20,239
Three times.

822
00:57:20,284 --> 00:57:22,704
All right, little man,
have a little lie-down.

823
00:57:22,745 --> 00:57:24,245
Good boy.

824
00:57:24,288 --> 00:57:26,038
I want you to take him
out of here.

825
00:57:26,082 --> 00:57:27,632
There you go.

826
00:57:32,088 --> 00:57:34,168
But that's not really it.

827
00:57:34,215 --> 00:57:36,175
No, no, no, no, no.

828
00:57:37,218 --> 00:57:39,848
No, it's more than just that.

829
00:57:42,348 --> 00:57:46,688
You think I'm responsible
for her death, don't you?

830
00:57:46,727 --> 00:57:48,397
So now

831
00:57:48,437 --> 00:57:53,727
you have a hostage
that-that I care about, right?

832
00:57:53,776 --> 00:57:55,696
Someone I love.

833
00:57:55,736 --> 00:58:00,366
So, what's your plan...
from here?

834
00:58:00,408 --> 00:58:01,778
Uh, what do you want?

835
00:58:01,826 --> 00:58:04,116
Do you want a confession, or...

836
00:58:04,161 --> 00:58:06,251
What's your endgame?

837
00:58:11,919 --> 00:58:15,509
I'm just gonna hurt you.

838
00:58:15,548 --> 00:58:19,218
I mean really fucking hurt you,

839
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:21,430
and that will be
good enough for me.

840
00:58:21,470 --> 00:58:25,600
So, y-you don't really want
anything, per se?

841
00:58:25,641 --> 00:58:29,151
You just, you want to blow her
up in front of me.

842
00:58:29,186 --> 00:58:30,856
Right?

843
00:58:30,896 --> 00:58:34,566
Wow, fuck.

844
00:58:36,110 --> 00:58:39,160
Uh...

845
00:58:39,196 --> 00:58:42,616
You are dark,
and I kind of like it.

846
00:58:42,658 --> 00:58:45,078
Will you please
take Teddy upstairs?

847
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:48,619
It's okay.

848
00:58:48,664 --> 00:58:51,924
Just answer one question for me.

849
00:58:51,959 --> 00:58:54,209
Just one.

850
00:58:54,253 --> 00:58:56,263
How do you know?

851
00:58:58,090 --> 00:58:59,720
How do you know?

852
00:58:59,759 --> 00:59:03,549
I mean, you must have
some rock-solid proof, right?

853
00:59:03,596 --> 00:59:07,556
That it was actually me
who killed your wife.

854
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:11,190
You must have that, right?
So what is it?

855
00:59:11,228 --> 00:59:14,858
Share. We're all
very interested.

856
00:59:16,484 --> 00:59:19,324
Now's not the time
to be strong and silent.

857
00:59:19,361 --> 00:59:20,821
Go for it.

858
00:59:22,865 --> 00:59:27,325
Are you telling me
that this whole thing

859
00:59:27,369 --> 00:59:31,749
i-is based on fucking feelings?

860
00:59:31,791 --> 00:59:33,541
- On a hunch?
- Will you please

861
00:59:33,584 --> 00:59:35,520
- take him upstairs?
- A little bit... Madelyn, hold on.

862
00:59:35,544 --> 00:59:38,304
- Take him upstairs!
- Shut the fuck up!

863
00:59:42,718 --> 00:59:44,718
Excuse me.

864
00:59:45,971 --> 00:59:49,141
You promised me no more lies.

865
00:59:49,183 --> 00:59:52,813
You fucking promised me.

866
00:59:54,396 --> 00:59:58,526
You and Vogelbaum should have
got your stories straight.

867
00:59:58,567 --> 01:00:00,527
They were so close.

868
01:00:00,569 --> 01:00:04,069
So fucking close, but there
was a few little details

869
01:00:04,114 --> 01:00:06,624
that were different.

870
01:00:06,659 --> 01:00:08,829
So I went back to Vogelbaum,

871
01:00:08,869 --> 01:00:12,409
and I managed to squeeze
the truth out of him.

872
01:00:12,456 --> 01:00:14,746
The real truth.

873
01:00:17,878 --> 01:00:21,418
Yes, that's it.

874
01:00:29,098 --> 01:00:31,058
I'm so sorry.

875
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:34,060
I should never have lied to you.

876
01:00:34,103 --> 01:00:38,073
I know now that you don't need
to be protected.

877
01:00:38,107 --> 01:00:40,067
I'm so sorry.

878
01:00:40,109 --> 01:00:42,569
Will you please
take Teddy upstairs?

879
01:00:46,282 --> 01:00:49,122
Did you ever really care
about me?

880
01:00:49,159 --> 01:00:50,789
You mean everything to me.

881
01:00:50,828 --> 01:00:52,788
No.

882
01:00:52,830 --> 01:00:54,120
No, no.

883
01:00:54,164 --> 01:00:57,174
I mean everything to your job.

884
01:00:58,794 --> 01:01:00,754
You care more
about that fucking baby

885
01:01:00,796 --> 01:01:02,456
- than you do about me.
- No.

886
01:01:02,506 --> 01:01:04,466
I love you.

887
01:01:04,508 --> 01:01:06,838
I love you. I love you.
I swear I love you.

888
01:01:06,886 --> 01:01:09,426
But?

889
01:01:09,471 --> 01:01:13,771
Tell me the truth,
or I walk out right now.

890
01:01:17,813 --> 01:01:19,823
I'm scared.

891
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:23,400
I'm scared of you.

892
01:01:25,404 --> 01:01:26,864
What?

893
01:01:26,906 --> 01:01:28,696
I said I'm scared.

894
01:01:28,741 --> 01:01:31,371
- Of?
- Of you.

895
01:01:31,410 --> 01:01:34,080
I'm scared of you.

896
01:01:34,121 --> 01:01:36,581
Thank you.

897
01:01:37,583 --> 01:01:41,003
Thank you
for finally being honest.

898
01:02:31,261 --> 01:02:33,261
Now...

899
01:02:35,641 --> 01:02:38,601
...what was that plan again?

900
01:02:39,645 --> 01:02:41,975
Oh, well...

901
01:03:05,921 --> 01:03:08,551
Wakey, wakey.

902
01:03:08,590 --> 01:03:10,550
Hey, buddy.

903
01:03:10,592 --> 01:03:12,852
You were out for quite a while.

904
01:03:12,886 --> 01:03:15,806
You can thank me for, uh,
saving you sometime later,

905
01:03:15,848 --> 01:03:18,098
but, for now,

906
01:03:18,142 --> 01:03:19,232
time to get up.

907
01:03:19,268 --> 01:03:20,978
Come on. You're gonna love this.

908
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:23,020
Come on.

909
01:03:27,317 --> 01:03:28,607
Mom!

910
01:03:28,652 --> 01:03:31,662
Wow,
look at this handsome devil.

911
01:03:33,657 --> 01:03:36,237
Hey, pal.

912
01:03:36,285 --> 01:03:37,785
You know who I am?

913
01:03:37,828 --> 01:03:39,328
Homelander.

914
01:03:39,371 --> 01:03:42,331
Yeah, that's right, but...

915
01:03:44,251 --> 01:03:46,211
...you know who else?

916
01:03:46,253 --> 01:03:48,013
No.

917
01:03:54,136 --> 01:03:56,096
Becca?

918
01:03:56,138 --> 01:03:58,178
- What?
- Huh.

919
01:03:58,223 --> 01:04:00,233
Mommy didn't tell you.

920
01:04:02,227 --> 01:04:04,227
Well...

921
01:04:07,775 --> 01:04:09,735
I'm your father,

922
01:04:09,777 --> 01:04:14,657
and we are a family.
