if you want out...

791
00:52:51,794 --> 00:52:52,961
I don't want out. I just...

792
00:52:53,045 --> 00:52:55,088
I'm not exactly jumping
at the opportunity

793
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:57,840
to get whipped and tortured
in your red room of pain.

794
00:52:57,925 --> 00:53:00,134
That room is much more
about pleasure.

795
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:02,053
Promise you.

796
00:53:05,641 --> 00:53:09,310
Would we still go out
to dinner and movies?

797
00:53:09,937 --> 00:53:12,272
That's not really my thing.

798
00:53:14,275 --> 00:53:16,317
Try to keep an open mind.

799
00:53:19,071 --> 00:53:21,447
If you agree to be
my submissive,

800
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:23,616
I will be devoted to you.

801
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:27,745
This is what I want.

802
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:29,831
And I want it with you.

803
00:53:34,587 --> 00:53:36,462
Why do I have to
sleep in here?

804
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:39,299
We slept in the same bed
last night.

805
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:41,509
Like normal people.

806
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:44,846
Try not to get
hung up on the
sleeping arrangements.

807
00:53:45,014 --> 00:53:46,723
If you agree to do this,

808
00:53:46,807 --> 00:53:48,141
you're gonna want
your own room.

809
00:53:48,601 --> 00:53:51,269
Why, because I'll
be your sex slave?

810
00:53:51,437 --> 00:53:54,188
I don't wanna do this here.
Let's talk downstairs.

No. You know what?

812
00:53:55,441 --> 00:53:56,733
I think I'll hold
on to my free will

813

a little while longer,
thank you.

814

I would like to go home.
Can I go home?

How did you start
doing this?

820
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:12,892
One of my mother's friends.

821
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:15,228
I was 15.

822
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:17,897
She seduced you?

823
00:55:18,065 --> 00:55:19,899
I was her submissive
for six years.

824
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:21,567
Seriously?

825
00:55:23,237 --> 00:55:24,904
Does your mother know that?

826
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:26,781
Of course not.

827
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:31,452
No one in my family knows
about this part of me.

828
00:55:34,123 --> 00:55:37,083
So, she introduced you
to all this?

829
00:55:37,251 --> 00:55:39,252
Mrs. Robinson?

Well, what changed
your mind?

839
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:17,749
By giving up control,
I felt free.

840
00:56:18,709 --> 00:56:22,587
From responsibility,
from making decisions.

841
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:25,131
I felt safe.

Your legs, for instance.

1050

do anything to me
at all, Christian?

1561
01:51:30,392 --> 01:51:33,019
If I told you,
you would never look
at me the same way again.

01:51:34,146 --> 01:51:35,813
So, there is a reason.

Tell me.

Do you wanna punish me
right now?

Yes. I wanna punish you
right now.

that I feel the same way
about being punished

1567
01:51:49,828 --> 01:51:51,245
as you do about
me touching you?

Would you still
want to punish me then?

No.

I wouldn't need to.

Ana, stop.
Why do you need to?

1573

Because it's the way I am!

of fucked up.
