1
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,350
Hello?

2
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,530
Nancy?

3
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,610
Nancy!

4
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,450
Hello?

5
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,090
Oh, my God...

6
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,140
Nancy!

7
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:57,350
Hey, what's the matter?

8
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,440
Nothing.

9
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,590
You're so beautiful.

10
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:39,350
Nancy!

11
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,490
Steve?

12
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,500
- Hey, Steve.
- Mmm.

13
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,250
I'll...

14
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,300
see you tomorrow, okay?

15
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,430
Mmm-hmm.

16
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,630
Oh! Jesus, you scared me.

17
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,880
Oh, I scared you?

18
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,170
I know, I should have called.

19
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,840
Where have you been?

20
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,380
We agreed on 10:00.

21
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:21,430
After the assembly, some people
wanted to get something to eat.

22
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,576
I didn't think it'd be a big deal.

23
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,770
You didn't think to call and let me know?

24
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,520
With everything that's been going on?

25
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,350
I didn't realize how late it was, okay?

26
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,190
I'm sorry, Mom.
What more do you want?

27
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,570
Hey, wait...

28
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:33,820
Whose sweatshirt is that?

29
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:36,570
Steve's.

30
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,360
Steve's.

31
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,756
So is Steve your boyfriend now?

32
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,070
What?

33
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,160
No!

34
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,290
It was just cold,
so I borrowed his sweatshirt.

35
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,620
It's not a big deal.

36
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,870
Nancy?

37
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,540
What?

38
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,000
You can talk to me.

39
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,970
You can talk to me.
Whatever happened.

40
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,760
Nothing happened.

41
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,760
Nancy.

42
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,680
Nothing happened.

43
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,150
Can I please go?

44
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,010
Will? Will?

45
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,760
Sweetheart, can you hear me?

46
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,840
Will...

47
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,180
Please...

48
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,890
Will...

49
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:49,980
It's me.

50
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:53,560
It's me. Just talk to me.
Talk to me.

51
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,650
Just say...

52
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,900
- Mom?
- Jonathan!

53
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,860
- Come here. Come here.
- Mom, what is this?

54
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:03,490
Come here. Come here.

55
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:05,910
- What's going on?
- It's Will. It's Will, he's...

56
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,830
he's trying to talk to me.

57
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,000
- He's trying to talk to you?
- Yes, through... through the lights.

58
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,210
- Mom...
- I know.

59
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,670
I know.

60
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,880
Just... just watch.

61
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,550
Will... your brother's here.

62
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:25,430
Can you show him what you showed me, baby?

63
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,310
Please...
Did you see that?

64
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,350
It's the electricity, Mom.

65
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,746
- It's acting up.
- No.

66
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,410
It's the same thing that fried the phone.

67
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,980
No! It is not the electricity, Jonathan.

68
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,280
Something is going on here!

69
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,990
- Yesterday, the wall...
- What? What about the wall?

70
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:44,296
- I don't know. I don't know.
- Mom, first the lights, then the wall?

71
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,700
I just know that Will is here.

72
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,280
No, Mom.

73
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:51,040
- Maybe if I get more lamps...
- No, Mom.

74
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,540
You don't need more lamps.
You need to stop this, okay?

75
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,790
He is just lost.

76
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,960
People are looking for him,
and they're going to find him.

77
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,630
Okay.

78
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,930
- This isn't helping.
- Okay, okay.

79
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,300
Okay, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

80
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,640
Can you do me a favor, Mom?

81
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,480
Can you just try and get some sleep?

82
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,230
- Yeah.
- Huh? Can you do that for me?

83
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,560
- I promise. I will.
- Yeah?

84
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,610
- Yeah.
- I just need to sit here for a minute.

85
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,570
All right, I'll go make breakfast.

86
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,150
- Okay.
- Yeah?

87
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,750
Will?

88
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,840
We just tell our parents
we have AV Club after school.

89
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,510
That'll give us at least a few hours
for Operation Mirkwood.

90
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:47,130
You seriously think that
the weirdo knows where Will is?

91
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,930
- Just trust me on this, okay?
- Okay.

92
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,510
- Did you get the supplies?
- Yeah.

93
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,220
Binoculars... from 'Nam.

94
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:55,480
Army knife... also from 'Nam.

95
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,020
Hammer, camouflage bandana...

96
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,270
and the wrist rocket.

97
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,416
You're gonna take out the Demogorgon
with a slingshot?

98
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,900
First of all, it's a wrist rocket.

99
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:07,320
And second of all,
the Demogorgon's not real.

100
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:08,410
It's made up.

101
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:11,740
But if there is something out there,
I'm gonna shoot it in the eye...

102
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,500
- and blind it.
- Dustin, what did you get?

103
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,580
Well, alrighty.

104
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:21,920
So, we've got...

105
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,380
Nutty Bars, Bazooka, Pez, Smarties,

106
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,010
Pringles, Nilla Wafers, apple,

107
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,260
- banana, and trail mix.
- Seriously?

108
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,850
We need energy for our travels.
For stamina.

109
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,060
And besides, why do we
even need weapons anyway?

110
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,770
- We have her.
- She shut one door!

111
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,020
With her mind!

112
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,770
Are you kidding me?
That's insane!

113
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,730
Imagine all the other cool stuff
she could do.

114
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,900
Like...

115
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:50,450
I bet... that she could make this fly!

116
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,160
Hey. Hey.

117
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,830
Okay, concentrate.
Okay?

118
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,210
Okay, one more time.

119
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,540
Okay.

120
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,340
Use your powers, okay?

121
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,420
Idiot.

122
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,180
- She's not a dog!
- Boys!

123
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,010
Time for school!

124
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,220
Just stay down here.

125
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,560
Don't make any noise,
and don't leave.

126
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,100
If you get hungry,
eat Dustin's snacks, okay?

127
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:21,060
- Michael!
- Coming!

128
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,520
You know those power lines?

129
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:24,400
- Power lines?
- Yeah.

130
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,520
The ones behind my house?

131
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:26,820
Yes.

132
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,440
Meet us there, after school.

133
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,200
After school?

134
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,610
Yeah, 3:15.

135
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,830
Ah.

136
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:43,500
When the numbers read three-one-five,
meet us there.

137
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,800
"Three-one-five."

138
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,840
Three-one-five.

139
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,410
Hey!

140
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,580
Hey!

141
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,160
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah!

142
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,700
Yeah, totally.

143
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:22,790
I just...

144
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,210
I feel like everyone's... staring at me.

145
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:28,800
Oh, I didn't... I didn't tell anyone.

146
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,130
I know.

147
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:32,050
I know.
Of course not.

148
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,680
But what about, like, Tommy,
and Carol and them?

149
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,850
You're being paranoid.

150
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:40,310
- I'm sorry.
- No. No, it's cute.

151
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,520
Hey...

152
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,270
I had a good time.

153
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,320
Yeah.

154
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,110
Yeah.
Me, too.

155
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,080
Mmm.
Hmm.

156
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,560
Hey, Ally.
Where's Barb?

157
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,480
Um, shouldn't you know?

158
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,730
You haven't seen her anywhere...
at all?

159
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,990
There she is.
Emerald City.

160
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,200
I heard they make
space weapons in there.

161
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,280
Space weapons?

162
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,490
Yeah. You know, like,
Reagan's Star Wars.

163
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,250
I guess we're gonna blow
the Ruskies to smithereens.

164
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,700
Hey, can I help you?

165
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,630
Uh, yeah.
We're here for a tour.

166
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,500
Oh, we don't give tours.

167
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,630
Okay...
A quick look around.

168
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:56,340
You have to get clearance for that.
You can contact, uh...

169
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:58,066
Rick Schaeffer
at the Department of Energy.

170
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,236
Maybe you seen it on TV.
We got a local kid that's missing.

171
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,156
We have reason to believe
he might have snuck in here.

172
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,640
Like I said,
you have to speak to Mr. Schaeffer.

173
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,940
- What's your name?
- Patrick.

174
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,610
Patrick, I got a panicked mayor,
and I got reporters breathing down my neck

175
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,280
and I got a very upset mother.

176
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:19,870
Now, I know the kid's not in there,
but I gotta check off this box.

177
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:24,160
Patrick, would you do me a favor?

178
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,790
Would you speak to your boss
and see what you can swing for us?

179
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,380
I'd really appreciate it.

180
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,340
I'm talking ten minutes, tops.

181
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:46,490
<i>...was occupying a large part of Lebanon.</i>

182
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,750
<i>Today, Syria has become a home for...</i>

183
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,960
<i>I have the power!</i>

184
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,720
<i>...gift that will last forever.</i>

185
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,920

191
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,370
- Joyce...
- Just ring me up, Donald.

192
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:36,500
And you think this missing boy
may have crawled through there?

193
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:39,210
Well, that was the idea.

194
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,710
Yeah, I just don't see
how that'd be possible.

195
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,500
We've got over 100 cameras.

196
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:46,220
Every square inch covered,
plus all my guys.

197
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,380
No one breaks in here.

198
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,090
Certainly not some kid.

199
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:52,600
Those cameras, you keep the tapes?

200
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,626
If you don't mind me asking,
what do you guys do in here?

201
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,400
You're asking the wrong guy.

202
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,530
- Staying one step ahead of the Russians?
- I expect. Something like that.

203
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:09,030
- Who's in charge here?
- That'd be Dr. Brenner.

204
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,990
And he builds the space lasers?

205
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:12,910
- Space lasers?
- Ignore him.

206
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:18,000
This is the night of the 6th and 7th
we're seeing here?

207
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,410
That's correct.

208
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,550
Is that it?

209
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,560
Like I said, we would have seen him.

210
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,020
The night of the 7th,
we had a search party out for Will.

211
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,810
You remember anything about that night?

212
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,150
Mmm, not much to remember.
Called it off.

213
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,820
- 'Cause of the storm.
- Yeah, a lot of rain that night.

214
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,570
You see any rain on that tape?

215
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,200
What are you thinking?

216
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,830
I don't know.

217
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,040
But they're lying.

218
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,330
That's why science doesn't
make any damn sense to me.

219
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:45,080
No, I swear. Look at this.
It's totally frostbite.

220
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,370
Oh, thanks, man.
It's a heated pool.

221
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,290
Well, if it's not frostbite,
then what is it?

222
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,210
Ugh, I don't care what it is,
it's disgusting!

223
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:54,000
Get it off the table.
We're eating here.

224
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:55,380
Ew!

225
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,090
Hey, Tommy.

226
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,050
When you left, did you see Barb?

227
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,550
- What?
- Barbara.

228
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,100
She's not here today.

229
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,310
I seriously have no idea
who you're talking about.

230
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:09,560
Come on, don't be an ass, man.
Did you...

231
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,480
Did you see her leave last night or not?

232
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,190
No, she was gone when we left.

233
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,740
Probably couldn't stand
listening to all that moaning.

234
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,660
Oh, Steve!

235
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:25,160
- Oh, Steve! Oh, Steve!
- Oh, Steve...

236
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,330
Oh, Steve!

237
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:29,056
Okay, chill.

238
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:33,000
Listen... I'm sure she's fine.
She's probably just...

239
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,590
she's probably just, like,
skipping or something.

240
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,090
Yeah.

241
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,760
Yeah, probably.

242
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:59,070
- How about this one?
- Too big for the sling.

243
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,410
So, do you think Eleven was born
with her powers, like the X-Men,

244
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:06,790
or do you think she acquired them, like...
like Green Lantern?

245
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:10,000
She's not a superhero.
She's a weirdo.

246
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,500
Why does that matter?
The X-Men are weirdos.

247
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:15,040
If you love her so much,
why don't you marry her?

248
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,460
What are you talking about?

249
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:18,050
- Mike, seriously?
- What?

250
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:20,170
You look at her all, like...

251
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,720
"Hi, El! El! El! El!

252
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,180
I love you so much!

253
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,156
- Would you marry me?"
- Shut up, Lucas.

254
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,680
Yeah, shut up, Lucas.

255
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,520
What are you losers
doing back here?

256
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,206
Probably looking for their missing friend.

257
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:35,150
That's not funny.
It's serious. He's in danger.

258
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:38,400
I hate to break it to you, Toothless,
but he's not in danger.

259
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,860
He's dead.
That's what my dad says.

260
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:43,240
He said he was probably killed
by some other queer.

261
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,410
Come on.
Just ignore them.

262
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,290
Watch where you're going, Frogface.

263
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,630
- You all right?
- Yeah.

264
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,930
Hey.

265
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:05,510
How about this one?

266
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:09,100
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

267
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,600
Yeah, this is it.

268
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,600
Oh, yeah.

269
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,060
Yeah, this is the monster killer!

270
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,190
Whoo!

271
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,420
Hey.

272
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,130
Oh, hey.

273
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,260
- Hey!
- Hey, Karen.

274
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,350
Hi...

275
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:33,970
I brought you a casserole.

276
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,190
Oh! Thank you, uh...

277
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:40,810
Uh, you wanna... come in?

278
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,170
Hey, Marissa.
How you doin'?

279
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:03,630
You have a lot of nerve showing up here.

280
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,050
What?

281
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:07,130
You could have at least called, said,

282
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:11,680
"Marissa! Hey, it's not gonna work out.
Sorry I wasted your time. I'm a dick."

283
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,260
Yep.

284
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:19,310
I'm sorry. Uh...

285
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:21,770
Maybe we could go out again next week?

286
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,400
Newspapers?
You guys got newspapers around here?

287
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,910
We have the <i>New York Times,</i>
the <i>Post,</i> all the big ones.

288
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,530
Organized by year and topic.

289
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,330
You can find the corresponding microfiche
in the reading room.

290
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:40,210
Okay, we're looking for anything
on the Hawkins National Laboratory.

291
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:42,106
Well, shouldn't you be looking
for that missing kid?

292
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:44,290
Yeah. We are.

293
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,340
Uh, so, why don't you start
with the <i>Times,</i>

294
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,840
and we'll check out the <i>Post.</i>

295
00:25:57,810 --> 00:25:59,390
The librarian?

296
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,900
Will always loved
Christmas, you know.

297
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,280
So I thought if I...
I put the lights up...

298
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,950
I don't know, he...

299
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,700
I'd feel like he was home somehow.

300
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,280
It's silly, I know.

301
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:58,410
No.
No, it's not silly.

302
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,500
How is Jonathan holding up?

303
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:03,540
You know,
he's good at taking care of himself.

304
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,580
He always has been, you know?

305
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:06,920
I...

306
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,170
I mean,
he thinks I'm losing my mind, but...

307
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:13,800
Is something the matter?

308
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,220
Uh, no.

309
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,550
No, I just...

310
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,850
We're having electrical problems.

311
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:20,060
Joyce.

312
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,560
I want you to know something.

313
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,770
If you need anything, anything at all...

314
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:27,400
Ted and I are here for you.

315
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,520
Thank you.
Thanks.

316
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:30,900
Okay.

317
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:33,740
How... how's Mike
dealing with this?

318
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,610
Is he, uh, okay?

319
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,660
Mike?
Uh... I don't know.

320
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,290
He skipped school yesterday.

321
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:43,330
He's never done anything like that before.

322
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,950
Let me throw in that casserole, okay?

323
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,130
Oh, where's Holly?

324
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,430
Hey!

325
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,180
She shouldn't be here.

326
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:48,770
Oh, I'm sorry.
She's quite the explorer these days.

327
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:52,110
- Wait, did you see something?
- Yeah.

328
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:53,860
What did... what did you see?
Tell me.

329
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,820
- What did you see? What...
- Joyce... Joyce!

330
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,780
Listen... Karen,
thank you for the casserole,

331
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,120
but I need you to leave.

332
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:02,910
Okay?

333
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,500
Come on, come on, come on...

334
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:10,540
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hi.

335
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:12,500
Hi, uh, Ms. Holland, it's Nancy.

336
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,960
Oh, Nancy, how are you?

337
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:15,090
<i>Good.
I'm good.</i>

338
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:18,380
Um, I was just wondering, uh,
is Barb there?

339
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:20,430
<i>Mmm... No, she hasn't come home yet.</i>

340
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,890
But she did come home, right?
After the vigil?

341
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:27,230
No, she said she was staying
with you last night.

342
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:31,100
Right, yes.
She did, sorry.

343
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:34,360
I meant, did she come home this morning?

344
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,610
I think she left some textbooks
and she was gonna go pick them up.

345
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:39,900
Oh, um, no, I haven't seen her.

346
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:44,910
Do... Do you know what?
I just remembered... she's at the library.

347
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:48,620
Nancy, will you please have her call me
as soon as you find her?

348
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:50,670
Yeah.
Yeah, I will.

349
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:53,080
Sorry to bother you.

350
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,140
Hey, man.

351
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,270
What's going on?

352
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,350
Nicole here was, uh,
telling us about your work.

353
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,786
- We've heard great things.
- Yeah, sounds cool.

354
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:17,530
And we'd just love to take a look.
You know, as... connoisseurs of art.

355
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:19,570
I don't know
what you're talking about.

356
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:20,926
- Oh, no? Oh...
- Hey.

357
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:23,160
Please, give me my bag.
No, just...

358
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,756
Man, he is totally trembling.
He must really have something to hide.

359
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,040
Here we go.

360
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,830
Ah...

361
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:29,910
Here we go.

362
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,710
- Oh, man.
- Let me see.

363
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,540
Dude.

364
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,606
Yeah, this isn't creepy at all.

365
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,316
- I was looking for my brother.
- No.

366
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:43,090
No, this is called stalking.
Mmm-hmm.

367
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,430
- What's going on?
- Here's the starring lady.

368
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:47,640
What?

369
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,770
This creep was spying on us last night.

370
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:53,100
He was probably gonna
save this one for later.

371
00:30:57,150 --> 00:31:01,650
See, you can tell
that he knows it was wrong, but...

372
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,780
Man, that's the thing about perverts...

373
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:05,820
It's hardwired into 'em.

374
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:08,790
You know, they just can't help themselves.

375
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,750
So...

376
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,540
we'll just have to take away his toy.

377
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,750
- Steve...
- No, please, not the camera.

378
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,550
No, no, wait, wait...
Tommy, Tommy.

379
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:22,550
It's okay.

380
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:25,640
Here you go, man.

381
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,520
Come on, let's go.
The game's about to start.

382
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,230
Boo.

383
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,610
Bye.

384
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:55,160
Hey, Nance!

385
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,500
Come on.

386
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,360
Three-one-five.

387
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,030
Three-one-five.

388
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:28,320
Three-one-five.

389
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:38,020
No! No!

390
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,390
Papa! Papa!

391
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,770
Papa!

392
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:43,940
Papa!

393
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,320
Papa!

394
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:49,990
No!

395
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:42,500
Incredible.

396
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,720
El!

397
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,220
You okay?

398
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,600
Hop on.
We only have a few hours.

399
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:59,080
So, I told Mr. Mundy...

400
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,240
"The solution of ten plus Y equals...

401
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:03,700
blow me."

402
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:06,186
Bull, if you did that,
you'd be in detention right now.

403
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:07,670
Saturday.

404
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,540
I bet Mr. Mundy's still a virgin.

405
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:10,790
Oh, he's so a virgin!

406
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,760
Maybe you should blow him, Carol.
Help your grades a bit.

407
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,840
Whoa, Nance, where you going?

408
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,430
I totally forgot.

409
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,100
I told my mom I would, um...

410
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,640
I would do something with her.

411
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,656
Well, what do you mean?
The game's about to start.

412
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,140
I'm sorry.

413
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,150
What the hell's wrong with her?

414
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:33,190
Maybe she freaked out
when you went all psycho on the psycho.

415
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,280
Oh, give me a break.

416
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,650
What'd you expect,
dating Miss Perfect?

417
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,660
Why did they hurt you?

418
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:46,870
What?

419
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:50,460
Oh, that.

420
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,540
Uh...

421
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:53,300
I just fell at recess.

422
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,420
- Mike...
- Yeah?

423
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:57,970
Friends tell the truth.

424
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:04,010
I was tripped by this mouth breather,
Troy, okay?

425
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,560
Mouth breather?

426
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,560
Yeah, you know...

427
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,770
a dumb person.

428
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:10,020
A knucklehead.

429
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,190
Knucklehead?

430
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:15,900
I don't know why I just didn't tell you.
Everyone at school knows.

431
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:18,820
I just didn't want you to think
I was such a wastoid, you know?

432
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,030
- Mike...
- Yeah?

433
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,620
I understand.

434
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:24,950
Oh.

435
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,790
Okay, cool.

436
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,080
Cool.

437
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:51,480
Barb?

438
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:54,980
Barb!

439
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,710
Barb?

440
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:26,720
Barb?

441
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,490
Barb?

442
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:48,490
Oh!

443
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:03,570
Will... are you here?

444
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,030
Okay, good, good, good, good.

445
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:10,990
Are you...

446
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:15,120
Um, blink once for yes, twice for no.

447
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:17,670
Can you do that for me,
sweetie?

448
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:18,790
Can you do...

449
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:23,590
Oh, good boy.
Good boy.

450
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:26,800
Baby, I need to know...

451
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:30,430
Are you alive?

452
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:39,690
Are you safe?

453
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:54,120
I need to know where to find you, honey.
Where... where are you?

454
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,670
Can you...
can you tell me where you are?

455
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,080
Can you...

456
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,750
Please, baby.
I need to find you. Tell me what to do.

457
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:07,720
Please just...

458
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,140
Will...

459
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:41,290
Hey! You're home early!
How was the game?

460
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:46,710
Nancy?
What's the matter?

461
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,880
It's Barb.

462
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:50,180
I think...

463
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:53,470
something happened.

464
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:56,470
Something terrible.

465
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,890
<i>I don't know, Chief.</i>

466
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,230
What don't you know?

467
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:04,480
This lady, Terry Ives,
sounds like a real nut to me.

468
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:08,610
Her kid was taken
for LSD mind control experiments?

469
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:09,780
She's been discredited.

470
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,006
Claim was thrown out...

471
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:12,160
Okay, forget about her.

472
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:14,490
Take a look at this.

473
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,790
- Dr. Martin Brenner.
- Who?

474
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:18,500
Brenner.

475
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,500
He runs Hawkins Lab.

476
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:21,620
Okay.

477
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,210
You don't find that interesting?

478
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:26,710
Not really.

479
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,670
He was involved in some hippie crap
back in the day, so what?

480
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,930
No, this isn't hippie crap.
This is CIA-sanctioned research.

481
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:36,140
Doesn't mean he had
anything to do with our kid.

482
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:39,220
Come on. Look at that.
Hospital gowns. All of 'em.

483
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:41,576
Now, that piece of fabric
that the teacher found by the pipe.

484
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,520
That sure looked
like a hospital gown to me, huh?

485
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,020
- Am I wrong?
- I don't know, Chief.

486
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:47,440
Come on, man.

487
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,820
Work with me here.

488
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,490
I'm not saying that there's
some grand conspiracy.

489
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,820
I'm just...

490
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,950
I'm saying maybe something happened.

491
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,880
Maybe Will was in the wrong place
at the wrong time

492
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,880
and he saw something
that he shouldn't have.

493
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:10,630
- It's a reach.
- It's a start.

494
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:13,260
<i>Hey, Powell,
is the chief with you?</i>

495
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:15,550
Hopper here.
What do you got?

496
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:00,180
Here.

497
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:02,810
Yeah, this is where Will lives.

498
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:04,430
Hiding.

499
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:07,150
No, no, this is where he lives.

500
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:09,230
He's missing from here.
Understand?

501
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,800
- What are we doing here?
- She said he's hiding here.

502
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,570
Um... no!

503
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:19,320
I swear, if we walked
all the way out here for nothing...

504
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:20,910
That's exactly what we did.

505
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:24,040
I told you she didn't know
what the hell she was talking about!

506
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,830
Why did you bring us here?

507
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:30,130
- Mike, don't waste your time with her.
- What do you want to do then?

508
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:31,856
Call the cops,
like we should have done yesterday.

509
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,526
- We are not calling the cops!
- Hey, guys?

510
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:35,760
- What other choice do we have?
- Guys!

511
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:45,680
Will...

512
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:05,000
Okay.

513
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,410
Okay, baby, talk to me.

514
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,210
Talk to me.
Where are you?

515
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:12,880
"R." Good, good, good, good.

516
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,340
That's good.
Come on, come on.

517
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,170
"I...

518
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,380
G...

519
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:20,140
H... T...

520
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,100
H...

521
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:23,180
E...

522
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:25,310
R... E..."

523
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:26,980
"Right here."

524
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:29,100
"Right here"?

525
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:31,860
I don't know what that means.

526
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:34,230
I need you to tell me what to do.

527
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,320
What should I do?

528
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:38,650
How do I get to you? How do I find you?
What should I do?

529
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:47,140
Oh, Jesus.

530
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,400
Oh, God.
Please tell me it's not the kid.

531
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:28,350
It's not Will.
It can't be.

532
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:39,480
It's Will.
It's really Will.

533
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,410
Mike...

534
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:49,660
"Mike"? "Mike," what?

535
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:51,870
You were supposed to help us
find him alive.

536
00:47:51,950 --> 00:47:53,370
You said he was alive!

537
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:54,870
Why did you lie to us?

538
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:57,170
What's wrong with you?

539
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:59,000
What is wrong with you?

540
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:01,300
- Mike...
- What?

541
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:07,220
Mike, come on.
Don't do this, man.

542
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:08,350
Mike...

543
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:11,100
Mike, where are you going?
Mike!

544
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:17,270
Mike!

545
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:29,280
Mom?

546
00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:33,250
Mom, what happened?

547
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:34,580
It's okay.

548
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:36,920
Hey.

549
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:43,510
Michael?

550
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:46,470
What's wrong?
