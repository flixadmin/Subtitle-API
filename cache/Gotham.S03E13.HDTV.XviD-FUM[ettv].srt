00:00:04,136 --> 00:00:05,803
I demand that you arrest

3
00:00:05,838 --> 00:00:08,651
Detective Gordon for
the murder of my husband.

4
00:00:08,674 --> 00:00:10,674
You talk of hate and revenge,

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,510
but you still love James Gordon.

6
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:15,513
I hope she knows what a
lying cheat you are, Maria.

7
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:17,348
I had to leave, or they
were gonna take me to prison.

00:00:17,383 --> 00:00:19,183
You can't run fast

First, we take away his mind.

12
00:00:24,123 --> 00:00:25,723
Who are you in on this with?!

13
00:00:27,226 --> 00:00:28,559
you can put him out of his misery.

14
00:00:28,594 --> 00:00:30,661
Guess where Dwight Pollard
worked before the morgue.

15
00:00:30,696 --> 00:00:31,429
Indian Hill.

16
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:33,864
It's time to get him.

17
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,733
What you call sanity,

18
00:00:35,768 --> 00:00:38,402
it's just a prison in your minds.

It seems after shutting down
Indian Hill, the government

42
00:02:45,097 --> 00:02:47,330
just packed everything
up and shipped it here.

43
00:02:47,366 --> 00:02:49,966
To a Wayne Enterprises facility.

44
00:02:50,002 --> 00:02:52,169
They sent it back to the

Yep.

Do we know how Jerome
ended up at Indian Hill?

No, but it makes sense.

49
00:02:59,578 --> 00:03:01,178
Strange was collecting
psychopaths, right?

50
00:03:01,213 --> 00:03:03,814
Fish, Galavan. Jerome fit the bill.

51

The woman that walked out of the
morgue, that was Dwight's trial run.

52
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:11,121
- He's gonna bring back Jerome.
- Oh, that's great.

53
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:14,091
That's all this city needs...
Jerome Valeska sucking air with

54
00:03:14,126 --> 00:03:16,160
- 50 fanatics at his back.
- Lucius.

55
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:20,564
If you wanted to bring back
someone from one of these,

56
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:22,166
what would be your next step?

57
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:25,235
Thawing 'em out. These
pods run at 237 degrees

58
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:28,105
below zero. You'd have to get
the body to core temperature

59
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,107
before even attempting reanimation.

60
00:03:30,142 --> 00:03:32,443
I worked on the design of
these when I was at Wayne.

61
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:34,478
Oh, good job. Thanks
for helping the bad guys.

62
00:03:34,513 --> 00:03:35,913
How long?

63
00:03:35,948 --> 00:03:37,481
If we're lucky, three hours.

64
00:03:48,961 --> 00:03:52,596
GCPD. You're under arrest.

65
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:58,001
He needs a hospital.

66
00:04:00,339 --> 00:04:02,773
No.

67
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:11,915
Appreciate you boys seeing me so late.

68
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:14,751
Doesn't seem like we had much of
a choice, Mr. Clemens, does it?

69
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:16,920
Please, call me Cole.

70
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:19,156
You want money.

71
00:04:20,237 --> 00:04:22,359
That bitch, Maria Kyle,

72
00:04:23,526 --> 00:04:25,472
she owes me 200 grand.

73
00:04:25,507 --> 00:04:26,635
I heard 100.

74
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:29,967
Well, you got to figure
gas money coming out here

75
00:04:30,002 --> 00:04:31,435
and, uh...

76
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,970
Well...

77
00:04:33,005 --> 00:04:34,638
think you can afford it?

78
00:04:34,673 --> 00:04:37,477
And what exactly is
the nature of this debt?

79
00:04:37,512 --> 00:04:41,044
Call it lost income due
to a broken contract.

80
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,146
She said she'd do something.

81
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:44,882
She didn't.

82
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:47,451
Ergo, she owes me the
money I would've made,

83
00:04:47,486 --> 00:04:49,486
- plus interest.
- Or what?

84
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:51,288
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

85
00:04:51,323 --> 00:04:53,490
I would never hurt a woman.

86
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:55,359
However,

87
00:04:55,394 --> 00:04:58,862
I would feel justified in
giving the police enough evidence

88
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:02,799
so that your little girlfriend

89
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:05,569
could only talk to her mama

90
00:05:05,604 --> 00:05:10,073
every other Thursday through
a screen for the next 40 years.

91
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:13,577
So, you give Maria
the money, she gives it

92
00:05:13,612 --> 00:05:15,078
to me...

93
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:17,247
I'm out of your lives.

94
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:19,249
Cash, obviously.

95
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:36,366
He should have been taken to a hospital.

96
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:37,568
He will be.

97
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:38,869
I needed to talk to him.

98
00:05:38,904 --> 00:05:40,237
I can do that better here than there.

99
00:05:40,272 --> 00:05:41,238
Bending the rules,

100
00:05:41,273 --> 00:05:42,239
what a surprise.

101
00:05:42,274 --> 00:05:43,607
It's Jerome Valeska we're talking about.

102
00:05:43,642 --> 00:05:44,875
You remember what he's done.

103
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,043
There's always a reason.

104
00:05:46,078 --> 00:05:48,278
He needs to go to a hospital.

105
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:50,280
Lee...

106
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:52,950
I know you had Falcone call off Zsasz.

107
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:54,051
Thank you.

108
00:05:54,086 --> 00:05:55,052
You want to thank me?

109
00:05:55,087 --> 00:05:56,587
When you find Dwight,

110
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:59,416
you have him bring back Mario
from the dead, how 'bout that?

111
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:08,565
James Gordon.

112
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:11,702
The James Gordon. Wow.

113
00:06:11,737 --> 00:06:14,571
It's actually you.

114
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:16,406
So cool I'm meeting you.

115
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:17,874
You should thank your friends.

116
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,744
They're the ones who left you behind.

117
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:22,245
Eh, I'd have done the same.

118
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:24,414
Tell me where he took Jerome.

119
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,883
Why? You can't stop it.

120
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:28,018
Stop what?

121
00:06:28,053 --> 00:06:29,419
Um...

122
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:30,988
the night of the awakening.

123
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:32,807
You mean waking up Jerome?

124
00:06:32,946 --> 00:06:35,959
Jerome is just the first step.

125
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:38,762
You think we're a small band.

126
00:06:38,797 --> 00:06:41,231
But we are everywhere.

127

00:08:57,589 --> 00:08:59,256
Or soon will be. That kind of chatter.

169
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:01,591
I need Ed, he's the only one...

170
00:09:01,627 --> 00:09:02,492
Listen to me!

171
00:09:02,527 --> 00:09:03,760
Ed's not here.

172
00:09:03,795 --> 00:09:04,928
I am.

173
00:09:04,963 --> 00:09:06,229
So get up, take a shower,

174
00:09:06,265 --> 00:09:08,431
do that disco vampire
thing with your hair.

175
00:09:08,467 --> 00:09:11,668
I will call a meeting of the
heads of the family, you will come,

176
00:09:11,703 --> 00:09:14,771
you will be your old self
and the rumors will stop.

177
00:09:14,806 --> 00:09:17,173
Why are you helping me?

178
00:09:17,209 --> 00:09:20,110
Because people think you like me, Ozzie.

179
00:09:20,145 --> 00:09:21,845
And as long as they're scared of you,

180
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,813
I get to keep breathing.

181
00:09:25,217 --> 00:09:27,484
1:00, my place.

182
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,797
Are you sure about this?

183
00:09:40,832 --> 00:09:42,232
Of course.

184
00:09:43,802 --> 00:09:45,368
You saved our lives.

185
00:09:46,405 --> 00:09:47,704
And other reasons.

186
00:09:47,739 --> 00:09:48,938
This is so stupid.

187
00:09:48,974 --> 00:09:50,440
Cole is a weasel.

188
00:09:50,475 --> 00:09:51,808
Just call the cops

189
00:09:51,843 --> 00:09:53,376
and get his ass arrested.

190
00:09:53,412 --> 00:09:54,811
And what about your mom?

191
00:09:54,846 --> 00:09:56,646
I mean, a weasel he most definitely is,

192
00:09:56,682 --> 00:09:59,115
but if what he says is
true, she could go to jail.

193
00:09:59,151 --> 00:10:00,984
And isn't that why you have lawyers?

194
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:02,485
You pay a guy like Cole,

195
00:10:02,521 --> 00:10:05,488
all that happens is he comes back again.

196
00:10:05,524 --> 00:10:06,823
And again.

197
00:10:06,858 --> 00:10:08,458
Look, worst case scenario,

198
00:10:08,493 --> 00:10:10,493
this buys us time to get
your mom's record cleared

199
00:10:10,529 --> 00:10:12,028
so he doesn't have a hold over her.

200
00:10:12,064 --> 00:10:13,563
Right, 'cause it's just money.

201
00:10:13,598 --> 00:10:15,665
Or another choice is I could leave.

202
00:10:17,369 --> 00:10:20,637
I don't want to, but...

203
00:10:20,672 --> 00:10:22,639
it is an option.

204
00:10:22,674 --> 00:10:24,140
You know what?

205
00:10:24,176 --> 00:10:25,342
Fine.

206
00:10:25,377 --> 00:10:26,876
Fine.

207
00:10:26,912 --> 00:10:30,580
If he doesn't mind
paying, why not, right?

208
00:10:30,615 --> 00:10:33,583
But I'd start keeping
a lot of cash around.

209
00:10:43,128 --> 00:10:44,527
They're all over the city.

210
00:10:44,563 --> 00:10:45,762
Maybe they were here the whole time

211
00:10:45,797 --> 00:10:47,163
and we just didn't notice.

212
00:10:47,199 --> 00:10:48,732
Seems most are concentrated

213
00:10:48,767 --> 00:10:50,533
in the Narrows, rougher parts of town.

214
00:10:50,569 --> 00:10:52,268
Abandoned buildings, warehouses.

215
00:10:52,304 --> 00:10:54,704
You're thinking this
is how they communicate?

216
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,006
Announce the next meeting
as the group moves around?

217
00:10:57,042 --> 00:10:59,275
Could be more than one group,
could be multiple chapters.

218
00:10:59,311 --> 00:11:02,712
Like the Elks, and Dwight's
the Grand Poobah or something.

219
00:11:02,748 --> 00:11:05,382
I'm thinking that son of a
bitch we found at the break-in

220
00:11:05,417 --> 00:11:07,617
could have been telling the truth.

221
00:11:07,652 --> 00:11:09,519
What, that they're everywhere?

222
00:11:09,554 --> 00:11:11,020
Huh? That Jerome's got thousands

223
00:11:11,056 --> 00:11:13,390
of disciples waiting for
him to wake up? Come on.

224
00:11:13,425 --> 00:11:15,759
- This is 50 wackadoos, tops.
- Maybe.

225
00:11:15,794 --> 00:11:16,893
Maybe not.

226
00:11:16,928 --> 00:11:18,661
I think I got something.

227
00:11:21,133 --> 00:11:23,933
You asked what Dwight
would need to revive Jerome.

228
00:11:23,969 --> 00:11:25,769
That girl, Melanie
Blake, his test subject...

229
00:11:25,804 --> 00:11:27,470
She received thousands
of volts of electricity.

230
00:11:27,506 --> 00:11:29,139
- That amount...
- Would cause

231
00:11:29,174 --> 00:11:31,775
- a power surge in the electric grid.
- I was about to say

232
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:33,710
that would cause a power
surge in the electric grid.

233
00:11:33,745 --> 00:11:35,578
Here. Ninth and Henry.

234
00:11:35,614 --> 00:11:37,280
The power company
recorded several surges

235
00:11:37,315 --> 00:11:38,982
around the time Melanie Blake
would have been brought back,

236
00:11:39,017 --> 00:11:40,617
and multiple surges as recent

237
00:11:40,652 --> 00:11:42,485
as 15 minutes ago, same location.

238
00:11:42,521 --> 00:11:43,787
I'll get the Strike Force.

239
00:11:43,822 --> 00:11:44,888
I'll get the car.

240
00:11:44,923 --> 00:11:47,223
I'll just...

241
00:11:47,259 --> 00:11:49,993
stay here, if that's okay.

242
00:11:50,028 --> 00:11:51,995
Yeah. That's okay.

243
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,163
Yo, Alvarez!

244
00:11:53,198 --> 00:11:56,199
We got a location on Dwight. Let's go.

245
00:12:00,539 --> 00:12:03,139
It's me.

246
00:12:04,943 --> 00:12:06,209
No.

247
00:12:08,547 --> 00:12:09,946
It goes here.

248
00:12:09,981 --> 00:12:11,548
This goes here.

249
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,986
Wake up.

250
00:12:17,022 --> 00:12:19,856
Come on. Wake up.

251
00:12:19,891 --> 00:12:22,258
I just heard from our guy in the
GCPD. They've got our location.

252
00:12:22,294 --> 00:12:25,762
The others are gonna wait
for us at the rendezvous.

253
00:12:25,797 --> 00:12:27,263
He's still dead.

254
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:29,833
I know he's still dead.

255
00:12:29,868 --> 00:12:32,435
I ran into some technical difficulties.

256
00:12:32,471 --> 00:12:33,703
Nothing that I can't fix.

257
00:12:33,738 --> 00:12:35,038
Is everything plugged in?

258
00:12:35,073 --> 00:12:36,840
Yes.

259
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:38,107
Try turning it on and off.

260
00:12:38,143 --> 00:12:39,342
I did! Three times.

261
00:12:39,377 --> 00:12:40,944
Look, you have spent the last year

262
00:12:40,979 --> 00:12:42,946
telling everyone that
the Prophet would return.

263
00:12:42,981 --> 00:12:45,715
People have made
sacrifices for you, Dwight.

264
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,984
I left a really good
job at the post office.

265
00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:49,853
The police are coming,

266
00:12:49,888 --> 00:12:51,488
and you promised them Jerome.

267
00:12:51,523 --> 00:12:53,389
The others expect to hear him speak.

268
00:12:53,425 --> 00:12:55,158
They want to see his face

269
00:12:55,193 --> 00:12:56,593
and if you can't do that...

270
00:13:07,239 --> 00:13:10,807
You know, you make an interesting point.

271
00:13:19,251 --> 00:13:22,418
They want to see your face.

272
00:13:40,038 --> 00:13:42,839
No awakening for this guy.

273
00:13:42,874 --> 00:13:45,341
Looks like Dwight took off pretty quick.

274
00:13:45,377 --> 00:13:48,711
Yeah. Like he knew we were coming.

275
00:13:52,784 --> 00:13:55,118
Harvey.

276
00:13:56,388 --> 00:13:58,488
Holy smacks. Is that Jerome?

277
00:14:02,494 --> 00:14:06,062
Why'd he take his face?

278
00:14:13,171 --> 00:14:16,773
Brothers and sisters,

279
00:14:16,808 --> 00:14:22,412
I promised you Jerome
would return and today

280
00:14:22,447 --> 00:14:25,882
your faith is rewarded.

281
00:14:25,917 --> 00:14:30,053
Jerome is here.

282
00:14:34,359 --> 00:14:38,361
Behold the Prophet.

283
00:14:46,304 --> 00:14:51,107
The Prophet is here.

284
00:14:51,142 --> 00:14:52,976
Where's Jerome?

285
00:14:53,011 --> 00:14:54,444
Where's the hell's Jerome?

286
00:14:54,479 --> 00:14:56,279
The Prophet is here.

287
00:14:56,314 --> 00:14:57,580
Where's Jerome?

288
00:14:57,616 --> 00:15:00,016
The Prophet is here!

289
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,454
Listen to me!

290
00:15:04,489 --> 00:15:08,157
Jerome is here.

291
00:15:08,193 --> 00:15:09,592
He never left us.

292
00:15:09,628 --> 00:15:12,595
Each of you kept him alive.

293
00:15:12,631 --> 00:15:15,365
Each of you is Jerome.

294
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,267
I am Jerome.

295
00:15:18,303 --> 00:15:20,937
We are all...

296
00:15:20,972 --> 00:15:24,340
Jerome.

297
00:15:24,376 --> 00:15:26,109
I'm Jerome.

298
00:15:26,144 --> 00:15:27,977
I'm Jerome.

299
00:15:28,013 --> 00:15:29,212
- I'm Jerome.
- I'm Jerome.

300
00:15:29,247 --> 00:15:31,347
You are Jerome.

301
00:15:31,383 --> 00:15:33,016
You are Jerome. You are Jerome.

302
00:15:33,051 --> 00:15:34,550
And you, and you...

303
00:15:36,721 --> 00:15:38,154
We are Jerome.

304
00:15:38,189 --> 00:15:41,190
We are Jerome!

305
00:15:41,226 --> 00:15:42,892
We are Jerome!

306
00:15:42,927 --> 00:15:44,394
We are Jerome!

307
00:15:44,429 --> 00:15:46,996
We are Jerome! We are Jerome!

308
00:15:47,032 --> 00:15:49,198
We are Jerome!

309
00:15:51,169 --> 00:15:53,069
Great. Thank you.

310
00:16:15,569 --> 00:16:18,181
I was going through the evidence
you recovered from the scene.

311
00:16:18,272 --> 00:16:20,372
That phone was on the
corpse next to Jerome.

312
00:16:20,407 --> 00:16:22,234
The last number came from the precinct.

313
00:16:22,309 --> 00:16:25,944
Wait. You're saying someone
in this house tipped them off?

314
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,081
It would make sense. They cleared
out moments before we got there.

315
00:16:29,116 --> 00:16:30,849
So we got a freaking mole?

316
00:16:32,219 --> 00:16:34,386
I was gonna replace that lamp.

317
00:16:34,421 --> 00:16:36,588
Is there any way to know who called?

318
00:16:36,624 --> 00:16:38,257
The number came up as the main.

319
00:16:38,292 --> 00:16:39,892
So you can't make some kind of gadget

320
00:16:39,927 --> 00:16:41,126
to figure it out?

321
00:16:41,162 --> 00:16:43,095
Sure. I'll get on that.

322
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,163
Let me see it.

323
00:16:46,567 --> 00:16:49,268
Everybody listen up!

324
00:16:49,303 --> 00:16:51,637
Everyone stop what you're doing.

325
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:56,942
We have a mole.

326
00:16:56,977 --> 00:17:00,078
The cult we've been tracking
was tipped off to our raid,

327
00:17:00,114 --> 00:17:02,514
and the call came from in here.

328
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:05,617
It was sent to this phone.

329
00:17:06,787 --> 00:17:09,454
So...

330
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:11,456
let's find out who the traitor is,

331
00:17:11,492 --> 00:17:14,293
shall we?

332
00:17:19,533 --> 00:17:20,499
Grab him!

333
00:17:20,534 --> 00:17:22,100
- Get him!
- Stop!

334
00:17:23,137 --> 00:17:24,403
No, no, don't.

335
00:17:24,438 --> 00:17:26,939
Get him in the room.

336
00:17:26,974 --> 00:17:28,407
Get him in the interrogation room.

337
00:17:28,442 --> 00:17:30,509
Good bluff.

338
00:17:30,544 --> 00:17:32,811
Thank you, sir.

339
00:17:32,846 --> 00:17:34,413
Everybody get back to work.

340
00:17:38,819 --> 00:17:40,385
My, my.

341
00:17:40,421 --> 00:17:42,654
You scrub up nice.

342
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,189
Am I early?

343
00:17:44,225 --> 00:17:45,724
About that...

344
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:47,192
I sent out the word.

345
00:17:47,228 --> 00:17:49,394
Said you wanted to see
everyone, express summons,

346
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:50,629
et cetera, et cetera.

347
00:17:50,664 --> 00:17:52,397
And...

348
00:17:52,433 --> 00:17:54,366
See for yourself.

349
00:17:54,401 --> 00:17:55,968
This is a rebellion.

350
00:17:56,003 --> 00:17:57,569
Well, don't say I didn't warn you.

351
00:17:57,605 --> 00:17:59,972
But... I did warn ya.

352
00:18:00,007 --> 00:18:03,342
You have been such a friend, Barbara.

353
00:18:03,377 --> 00:18:04,810
Tell me.

354
00:18:04,845 --> 00:18:07,145
What should I do now?

355
00:18:07,181 --> 00:18:11,750
Well. If it were me, I
would pick one of them,

356
00:18:11,785 --> 00:18:14,019
the Duke, maybe, or Tommy Bones,

357
00:18:14,054 --> 00:18:15,420
and teach them a lesson.

358
00:18:15,456 --> 00:18:17,856
They don't respect you, Oswald.

359
00:18:17,891 --> 00:18:20,926
In fact, you probably want to
kill Tommy Bones and the Duke.

360
00:18:20,961 --> 00:18:22,594
Just clean house.

361
00:18:25,332 --> 00:18:27,499
I'm sorry. Just...

362
00:18:29,937 --> 00:18:32,371
Well. I'm glad you can
find the humor in it.

363
00:18:32,406 --> 00:18:34,373
Did you really think

364
00:18:34,408 --> 00:18:37,242
I would be so easy to manipulate?

365
00:18:41,482 --> 00:18:43,081
What was your plan?

366
00:18:43,117 --> 00:18:44,349
Take advantage of me

367
00:18:44,385 --> 00:18:46,351
while I was in a weakened state?

368
00:18:46,387 --> 00:18:48,587
Trick me into attacking my subordinates

369
00:18:48,622 --> 00:18:50,289
so they truly did rebel?

370
00:18:50,324 --> 00:18:52,124
Inciting war,

371
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:54,393
so that you could pick up the pieces?

372
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:59,965
My dear, you are tragically

373
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,967
out of your depth.

374
00:19:02,002 --> 00:19:04,569
Oswald. I am your friend.

375
00:19:04,605 --> 00:19:06,772
Perhaps I should call
Tommy Bones. Or the Duke.

376
00:19:06,807 --> 00:19:09,041
Or any of the families,
and ask them if you

377
00:19:09,076 --> 00:19:10,876
really invited them to this meeting.

378
00:19:10,911 --> 00:19:12,878
What would they say?

379
00:19:17,685 --> 00:19:20,285
Yes?

380
00:19:20,321 --> 00:19:21,987
He's right here.

381
00:19:23,257 --> 00:19:25,023
Tommy Bones.

382
00:19:28,195 --> 00:19:29,227
Yes?

383
00:19:29,263 --> 00:19:31,797
You get the message?

384
00:19:31,832 --> 00:19:33,932
We don't work for you no more.

385
00:19:33,967 --> 00:19:36,435
Your day is done, freak.

386
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:39,071
How dare you?

387
00:19:39,106 --> 00:19:40,806
I will gut you!

388
00:19:40,841 --> 00:19:43,275
I will hang your entrails

389
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,610
from every lamppost in Gotham!

390
00:19:45,646 --> 00:19:47,245
Then Nygma dies.

391
00:19:47,281 --> 00:19:49,081
What?

392
00:19:49,116 --> 00:19:52,751
Walk away quiet. Maybe we'll
send him back in one piece.

393
00:19:52,786 --> 00:19:54,786
We'll even let you keep being mayor.

394
00:19:58,225 --> 00:19:59,424
They have Ed.

395
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,527
They're holding him hostage.

396
00:20:02,563 --> 00:20:05,130
I will kill them.

397
00:20:05,165 --> 00:20:06,365
Every one of them!

398
00:20:08,335 --> 00:20:09,601
I have to go.

399
00:20:09,636 --> 00:20:11,036
I have to gather my men.

400
00:20:20,314 --> 00:20:22,681
Put her on.

401
00:20:27,521 --> 00:20:29,721
- Hey.
- He bought it.

402
00:20:33,394 --> 00:20:34,393
Well done.

403
00:20:34,428 --> 00:20:35,494
So we're good, now?

404
00:20:35,529 --> 00:20:38,063
I said all you told me.

405
00:20:38,098 --> 00:20:40,198
Yeah. We're good.

406
00:20:44,238 --> 00:20:47,906
Officer Andrew Dove,
six years with the GCPD,

407
00:20:47,941 --> 00:20:50,909
twice decorated.

408
00:20:50,944 --> 00:20:53,745
Up for promotion in six months.

409
00:20:53,781 --> 00:20:55,547
Well, congrats, pal,

410
00:20:55,582 --> 00:20:59,317
'cause you're going to Blackgate,
and they love cops there.

411
00:20:59,353 --> 00:21:01,586
I stopped being a cop a long time ago.

412
00:21:01,622 --> 00:21:03,655
The hell you did.

413
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:05,690
No one ever stops being a cop.

414
00:21:05,726 --> 00:21:07,259
You were here

415
00:21:07,294 --> 00:21:09,161
when Jerome and the Maniax attacked.

416
00:21:09,196 --> 00:21:11,696
You defended this house against him.

417
00:21:11,732 --> 00:21:14,399
And that's the night I changed.

418
00:21:14,435 --> 00:21:16,668
Don't waste your breath, Jim.

419
00:21:16,703 --> 00:21:18,236
Let's put him on a bus to Blackgate,

420
00:21:18,272 --> 00:21:19,571
stick a target on his back

421
00:21:19,606 --> 00:21:21,072
and forget about him!

422
00:21:21,108 --> 00:21:22,707
Good cop, bad cop

423
00:21:22,743 --> 00:21:24,376
doesn't work on cops.

424
00:21:24,411 --> 00:21:27,612
At the very least, you two
should have switched roles.

425
00:21:28,982 --> 00:21:30,749
You know what?

426
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,219
You're right.

427
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:38,190
You're gonna tell me
what Dwight's planning

428
00:21:38,225 --> 00:21:39,524
right now!

429
00:21:42,996 --> 00:21:44,596
You think this is funny, don't you?

430
00:21:44,631 --> 00:21:46,264
How about this?!

431
00:21:47,568 --> 00:21:50,435
Hilarious.

432
00:21:50,471 --> 00:21:51,636
Again!

433
00:21:51,672 --> 00:21:53,772
If you insist!

434
00:21:58,612 --> 00:22:00,745
Harvey. Harvey, no! No.

435
00:22:05,052 --> 00:22:07,085
25 milligrams of sodium pentothal.

436
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,255
Give him a few minutes, he'll
tell you what you need to know.

437
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:12,090
Damn.

438
00:22:14,361 --> 00:22:15,427
Lee...

439
00:22:17,097 --> 00:22:19,197
- Lee, stop.
- Don't touch me.

440
00:22:20,334 --> 00:22:21,600
What the hell was that?

441
00:22:21,635 --> 00:22:23,235
You wanted Dove to
talk, so now he'll talk.

442
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,636
- You shouldn't have done that.
- Really?

443
00:22:24,672 --> 00:22:26,905
Did I not just see Harvey
punch him in the face?

444
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,273
What about you? You
brought a wounded suspect

445
00:22:28,309 --> 00:22:29,474
into the precinct

446
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:30,876
instead of taking him to the hospital,

447
00:22:30,911 --> 00:22:32,377
because you wanted to interrogate him.

448
00:22:32,413 --> 00:22:34,046
You guys can bend the
rules, but I can't.

449
00:22:34,081 --> 00:22:37,215
None of us should... Me, Harvey, you.

450
00:22:37,251 --> 00:22:39,418
But especially not you.
You're better than that.

451
00:22:39,453 --> 00:22:40,419
Oh, that's so sweet.

452
00:22:40,454 --> 00:22:41,787
Would you stop it?

453
00:22:41,822 --> 00:22:43,989
Look, you want to blame me

454
00:22:44,024 --> 00:22:45,557
for Mario's death, that's fine.

455
00:22:45,592 --> 00:22:48,794
I can live with that,
knowing you're okay.

456
00:22:48,829 --> 00:22:50,329
But don't let your hatred of me

457
00:22:50,364 --> 00:22:52,331
turn you into something you're not.

458
00:22:52,366 --> 00:22:54,066
Or what, Jim?

459
00:22:54,101 --> 00:22:56,501
If I change too much,
you're gonna put two

460
00:22:56,537 --> 00:22:58,337
in my heart, like you did to Mario?

461
00:23:00,941 --> 00:23:03,175
I'll talk to Harvey.

462
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:04,843
You came back to the job too soon.

463
00:23:04,878 --> 00:23:05,944
You need some time off.

464
00:23:05,979 --> 00:23:07,579
Yeah, you do that.

465
00:23:07,614 --> 00:23:09,581
And I'll tell the commissioner
how I saw the acting captain

466
00:23:09,616 --> 00:23:11,350
punch a suspect in the face.

467
00:23:11,385 --> 00:23:15,954
Don't ever touch me again
or tell me what to do.

468
00:23:18,392 --> 00:23:20,926
Jim, hey, it worked.

469
00:23:20,961 --> 00:23:22,027
Dove gave it up.

470
00:23:22,062 --> 00:23:23,328
Dwight's heading to Channel 9

471
00:23:23,364 --> 00:23:25,030
to make some sort of announcement

472
00:23:25,065 --> 00:23:26,298
on the 6:00 news.

473
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:28,333
All right, call the station.

474
00:23:28,369 --> 00:23:30,913
- Have them evacuate...
- I'm already on it. Let's go!

475
00:23:33,507 --> 00:23:36,475
The GCPD has asked us
to evacuate the building.

476
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:40,278
They assure me that
everything is under control.

477
00:23:41,815 --> 00:23:43,782
No one's going anywhere.

478
00:23:51,258 --> 00:23:53,892
We've got a show to do, people.

479
00:23:53,927 --> 00:23:56,728
And, as you know, the show

480
00:23:56,764 --> 00:23:59,865
must go on.

481
00:24:11,412 --> 00:24:13,712
What the...

482
00:24:14,915 --> 00:24:16,615
Boo. Ha, ha, ha...

483
00:24:22,978 --> 00:24:24,911
Wow. Well, that is quite a story.

484
00:24:24,947 --> 00:24:27,114
You know, I know I've been dead,

485
00:24:27,149 --> 00:24:29,649
but doesn't that seem
kind of crazy to you?

486
00:24:29,685 --> 00:24:31,351
Hey, maybe you're dreaming.

487
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:32,853
Try shooting yourself.

488
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:35,789
Huh. Oh...

489
00:24:36,792 --> 00:24:38,191
Nah. Hey,

490
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:39,760
tell me more about this cult.

491
00:24:39,795 --> 00:24:41,361
They think I'm pretty great, huh?

492
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:44,164
They're a bunch of raving
lunatics and idiots.

493
00:24:44,199 --> 00:24:45,532
Lunatics and idiots?

494
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,067
Ooh, my kind of people.

495
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:51,705
Sorry.

496
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,873
Head's still a little fuzzy.

497
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,542
You know, I was just reborn.

498
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:57,944
Last year was nothing but darkness...

499
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:01,748
as far as the eye can see.

500
00:25:03,452 --> 00:25:05,085
I know you, right?

501
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,887
- Yep.
- Hey,

502
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:10,624
did you and I ever, uh...

503
00:25:10,659 --> 00:25:12,926
Oh, God, no.

504
00:25:12,961 --> 00:25:15,195
Why? Gingers not your type?

505
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:16,696
Oh, I remember.

506
00:25:16,732 --> 00:25:20,634
You're Jim Gordon's little... Twinkie.

507
00:25:20,669 --> 00:25:21,902
Easy.

508
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,937
How's it going between you and Jimbo?

509
00:25:23,972 --> 00:25:27,474
Huh? You still together, or...

510
00:25:27,509 --> 00:25:28,942
- No.
- No?

511
00:25:28,977 --> 00:25:32,512
Oh, that's a shame.

512
00:25:32,548 --> 00:25:34,781
I really liked you guys.

513
00:25:34,817 --> 00:25:36,950
What happened?

514
00:25:38,487 --> 00:25:41,121
He killed my husband
on our wedding night.

515
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,526
Glad you find it funny.

516
00:25:46,562 --> 00:25:47,527
I do.

517
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:51,598
I get why you don't.

518
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,702
Wow.

519
00:25:55,737 --> 00:25:58,939
You miss a lot being dead.

520
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,508
You know what? Go ahead, enjoy it.

521
00:26:01,543 --> 00:26:02,876
There's about a hundred cops

522
00:26:02,911 --> 00:26:04,077
on the other side of that door

523
00:26:04,112 --> 00:26:05,478
ready to kill you all over again.

524
00:26:06,515 --> 00:26:08,815
I see your point.

525
00:26:08,851 --> 00:26:10,217
It's a business.

526
00:26:10,252 --> 00:26:13,320
So, when I was last, you know,

527
00:26:13,355 --> 00:26:15,622
uh, alive,

528
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,824
I was about to kill Bruce Wayne.

529
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:20,160
I suppose I didn't manage to...

530
00:26:20,195 --> 00:26:22,195
No. Right.

531
00:26:22,231 --> 00:26:25,966
Theo Galavan killed me,
that jug-eared Judas.

532
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,001
Well, I suppose I should
start by killing him.

533
00:26:28,036 --> 00:26:29,369
Theo Galavan's dead.

534
00:26:29,404 --> 00:26:32,038
Oh... Who beat me to it?

535
00:26:32,074 --> 00:26:34,407
W-Which time?

536
00:26:34,443 --> 00:26:37,477
Galavan came back to life, too?

537
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:40,046
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm?

538
00:26:40,082 --> 00:26:43,316
That son of a bitch
is always upstaging me.

539
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:47,754
Well, I guess I'm just
missing one thing, then.

540
00:26:49,391 --> 00:26:51,424
Where is my face?

541
00:27:04,606 --> 00:27:06,239
Something's not right.

542
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:11,511
Whoa! Hold your position.

543
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:13,580
Whoa! Hold!

544
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,254
Son of a bitch!

545
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:23,690
I'm on the scene now

546
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,091
and we're reporting live.

547
00:27:25,127 --> 00:27:26,192
The Channel 9 news station

548
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:28,628
seems to have had a hostage situation.

549
00:27:28,664 --> 00:27:31,231
Uh, we're not sure how many hostages...

550
00:27:38,674 --> 00:27:40,373
It's all here?

551
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:42,442
200 grand.

552
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,945
We did it, baby.

553
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,780
Come on, let's just
get out of this town.

554
00:27:46,815 --> 00:27:49,082
Hey, smile.

555
00:27:50,652 --> 00:27:51,851
We won.

556
00:27:51,887 --> 00:27:55,455
Yeah, smile. You won.

557
00:27:57,059 --> 00:27:58,792
You're rich.

558
00:27:58,827 --> 00:27:59,859
Go away, kid.

559
00:27:59,895 --> 00:28:01,761
Shut up, Cole.

560
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:04,597
You caught me.

561
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:08,568
What do you want me to say?

562
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:10,570
I just want to make sure I got it right.

563
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:13,173
You find out Bruce Wayne

564
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:15,542
and your abandoned daughter are a thing.

565
00:28:15,577 --> 00:28:16,710
You figure,

566
00:28:16,745 --> 00:28:18,144
"There's an easy mark."

567
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,280
You come back, make nice,

568
00:28:20,315 --> 00:28:22,515
do the whole mother/daughter
bonding thing,

569
00:28:22,551 --> 00:28:25,318
and then pull this scam.

570
00:28:25,762 --> 00:28:28,388
- That about it?
- Pretty much.

571
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,525
You want to hate me,

572
00:28:32,561 --> 00:28:33,693
that's your choice.

573
00:28:33,729 --> 00:28:36,096
- You're damn right.
- Why so angry?

574
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,864
It's not like your boyfriend
cares about the money.

575
00:28:37,899 --> 00:28:39,276
I know he doesn't care about the money.

576
00:28:39,311 --> 00:28:40,600
I don't care about the money.

577
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:43,737
I care that my mother,

578
00:28:43,772 --> 00:28:46,506
who left me when I was a kid,

579
00:28:46,541 --> 00:28:48,208
only came back to use me!

580
00:28:48,243 --> 00:28:49,676
Easy.

581
00:28:49,711 --> 00:28:51,378
Selina!

582
00:28:51,413 --> 00:28:54,481
Please, don't.

583
00:28:56,184 --> 00:28:58,852
Don't ever...

584
00:28:58,887 --> 00:29:02,055
come back.

585
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:12,866
The time has come to reveal ourselves.

586
00:29:12,901 --> 00:29:15,635
Gotham will remember...

587
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:19,205
No. History will remember.

588
00:29:19,241 --> 00:29:21,741
Dwight?

589
00:29:21,777 --> 00:29:22,876
Dwight?

590
00:29:23,574 --> 00:29:25,578
The police are outside.

591
00:29:26,214 --> 00:29:29,649
Detective Gordon is on the phone.

592
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:32,752
It's just like when he called Jerome
outside the Children's Hospital benefit.

593
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,892
Hello, Jimbo.

594
00:29:38,927 --> 00:29:41,227
Shut up, Dwight. We have
the building surrounded.

595
00:29:41,263 --> 00:29:43,763
There's no way out. Let the hostages go.

596
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:46,433
You're outside?

597
00:29:46,468 --> 00:29:48,601
You are, aren't you?

598
00:29:48,637 --> 00:29:49,836
Goody!

599
00:29:52,774 --> 00:29:53,740
The cult will never follow you, Dwight.

600
00:29:53,775 --> 00:29:56,609
I saw you, at the theater?

601
00:29:56,645 --> 00:29:58,011
You don't have what it takes.

602
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,747
Breathe, James.

603
00:30:00,782 --> 00:30:03,049
I haven't touched a hair on
your pretty girlfriend's head.

604
00:30:06,455 --> 00:30:10,056
You're just repeating what
Jerome said to me last year.

605
00:30:10,092 --> 00:30:11,858
I am Jerome.

606
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,193
No, no.

607
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:14,194
You're the understudy

608
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,229
pretending to be the star.

609
00:30:16,264 --> 00:30:17,397
You're a fraud.

610
00:30:17,432 --> 00:30:19,399
No, I am Jerome!

611
00:30:19,434 --> 00:30:21,201
I am Jerome.

612
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,570
And soon Gotham will know it.

613
00:30:23,605 --> 00:30:25,038
Well, for the record.

614
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,739
You're doing one thing Jerome never did.

615
00:30:26,775 --> 00:30:28,908
Boring me.

616
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:32,645
So the back entrance is a no-go,

617
00:30:32,681 --> 00:30:33,880
but we think we might have found a way

618
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,482
through the ventilation system.

619
00:30:35,517 --> 00:30:38,384
All right, let's go.

620
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,986
Dwight's going live any minute.

621
00:30:41,823 --> 00:30:43,623
The Penguin killed the Duke and his crew

622
00:30:43,658 --> 00:30:45,592
because he thinks they kidnapped Nygma.

623
00:30:45,627 --> 00:30:48,728
Meanwhile, they're still
looking for Tommy Bones.

624
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:51,097
Hmm. Who they won't find,
since you already killed him.

625
00:30:51,133 --> 00:30:53,633
And now these nimrods are
terrified for their life.

626
00:30:53,668 --> 00:30:56,803
Which is why they're here
with their guard down. Hmm.

627
00:30:56,838 --> 00:30:58,972
You gotta hand it to Nygma.

628
00:30:59,007 --> 00:31:01,174
He knew how to get Penguin
to turn on the five families.

629
00:31:01,209 --> 00:31:04,677
Poor Ozzie is tearing
apart everything he built.

630
00:31:04,713 --> 00:31:06,913
Remember, when this is
over, and we're in charge,

631
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,915
Nygma dies.

632
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,950
You made a promise.

633
00:31:14,689 --> 00:31:16,589
Sealed with a kiss, baby.

634
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:18,691
Now, what about them?

635
00:31:18,727 --> 00:31:21,294
We've got option "A,"
appeal to their reason...

636
00:31:21,329 --> 00:31:23,930
Convince them we alone can
protect them from Penguin.

637
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:26,466
Seems unlikely. They are men. Hmm.

638
00:31:26,501 --> 00:31:28,234
You just like option "B."

639
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:29,802
Mm.

640
00:31:29,838 --> 00:31:31,738
Fine, option "B."

641
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,778
All right, we worked it out.

642
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:39,812
What the...

643
00:31:39,848 --> 00:31:41,714
Ed, honey, everything's set.

644
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,283
Penguin's all yours.

645
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,654
Yeah, yeah, option "B".

646
00:31:52,194 --> 00:31:55,962
Four... three... two... one...

647
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:58,898
Brothers and sisters,

648
00:31:58,934 --> 00:32:01,834
my name is Dwi...

649
00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:06,039
My name is...

650
00:32:06,074 --> 00:32:09,842
Jerome.

651
00:32:11,713 --> 00:32:15,848
History will call
tonight the night of...

652
00:32:15,884 --> 00:32:17,350
Look at that.

653
00:32:17,385 --> 00:32:20,753
No charisma, no stage presence.

654
00:32:20,789 --> 00:32:23,056
The time has come to reveal ourselves.

655
00:32:23,091 --> 00:32:25,892
Though he is a handsome fellow, huh?

656
00:32:25,927 --> 00:32:28,761
Hey, Doc, keep watching.

657
00:32:28,797 --> 00:32:31,564
You don't want to
miss what happens next.

658
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,882
Today, Gotham will remember.

659
00:32:47,419 --> 00:32:50,187
Oh, sorry! Didn't see you.

660
00:32:56,328 --> 00:32:59,963
Put your weapons down.

661
00:32:59,998 --> 00:33:01,965
We want to talk to Jerome.

662
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:05,803
We want to talk to Dwight.

663
00:33:05,838 --> 00:33:08,172
We won't hurt you.

664
00:33:08,207 --> 00:33:11,742
We just want to talk to you, Dwight.

665
00:33:21,487 --> 00:33:25,255
The Prophet told us
that we're all prisoners,

666
00:33:25,291 --> 00:33:28,659
slaves to a city that doesn't love us,

667
00:33:28,694 --> 00:33:31,495
but tonight...

668
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:35,099
tonight we rise up.

669
00:33:35,134 --> 00:33:38,168
We are all Jerome.

670
00:33:38,204 --> 00:33:40,671
Each of you...

671
00:33:40,706 --> 00:33:43,040
is Jerome. That's the truth.

672
00:33:43,075 --> 00:33:44,341
Stop.

673
00:33:45,377 --> 00:33:48,979
All of us are Jerome.

674
00:33:49,014 --> 00:33:51,115
We are all...

675
00:33:52,118 --> 00:33:53,684
Drop it!

676
00:33:53,719 --> 00:33:56,420
Cut the feed!

677
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:00,390
Keep them up where I can see them.

678
00:34:00,426 --> 00:34:01,892
Dwight, stop!

679
00:34:05,131 --> 00:34:06,396
- Just keep moving.
- All right, man, all right.

680
00:34:06,432 --> 00:34:08,232
Don't make...

681
00:34:08,267 --> 00:34:09,867
You can't do this. This is
the night of the awakening.

682
00:34:09,902 --> 00:34:11,435
This is the night of the awakening.

683
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:13,804
Not anymore.

684
00:34:22,348 --> 00:34:24,481
Did you know?

685
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:28,352
That she was only after the money.

686
00:34:28,387 --> 00:34:29,553
I-I wasn't sure.

687
00:34:29,588 --> 00:34:31,054
Did you know?!

688
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:33,457
Yes.

689
00:34:33,492 --> 00:34:34,611
It was obvious.

690
00:34:34,661 --> 00:34:37,261
And you gave her the money anyway?

691
00:34:37,297 --> 00:34:38,562
The money wasn't important.

692
00:34:38,598 --> 00:34:39,597
She was lying!

693
00:34:39,632 --> 00:34:40,898
What were my options, Selina?

694
00:34:40,933 --> 00:34:43,367
If I didn't give her the money,
she would've skipped town.

695
00:34:43,403 --> 00:34:45,903
So, you thought you'd pay her.

696
00:34:45,938 --> 00:34:48,939
Have her stick around, maybe
get used to being my mom.

697
00:34:48,975 --> 00:34:50,107
Is that it?

698
00:34:50,915 --> 00:34:52,443
Yes.

699
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,212
- You lied to me.
- I didn't tell you the truth.

700
00:34:55,248 --> 00:34:57,214
- It's the same thing.
- Perhaps, but telling you

701
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:59,116
your mother was a con artist
who'd only sought you out

702
00:34:59,152 --> 00:35:02,053
for the purposes of
getting money from me...

703
00:35:02,088 --> 00:35:04,455
didn't seem like a very
attractive alternative.

704
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:08,659
You... and her...

705
00:35:08,695 --> 00:35:11,162
you both lied to me.

706
00:35:11,197 --> 00:35:13,264
But for very different reasons.

707
00:35:20,839 --> 00:35:22,339
Fight me!

708
00:35:22,874 --> 00:35:24,541
Hit me!

709
00:35:24,576 --> 00:35:26,209
Fight me!

710
00:35:27,179 --> 00:35:29,579
Fight me!

711
00:35:29,615 --> 00:35:30,847
No.

712
00:35:34,186 --> 00:35:39,222
You know... the only reason
she came back to Gotham,

713
00:35:39,258 --> 00:35:42,559
the only reason she tracked me down

714
00:35:42,594 --> 00:35:47,163
after 11 years...

715
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:49,199
was you.

716
00:35:59,177 --> 00:36:00,510
We love you!

717
00:36:00,545 --> 00:36:02,345
We love you!

718
00:36:02,381 --> 00:36:05,382
We love you, Dwight!

719
00:36:07,252 --> 00:36:09,386
I want Dwight taken
back for questioning.

720
00:36:09,421 --> 00:36:11,354
So much for the big awakening, huh?

721
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:13,923
Yeah, still, we should get
some cars out on the street.

722
00:36:13,959 --> 00:36:15,892
Dwight got his message out.

723
00:36:15,927 --> 00:36:18,128
A few lunatics could still respond.

724
00:36:21,066 --> 00:36:22,232
Lee? What is...

725
00:36:22,267 --> 00:36:23,233
Jim.

726
00:36:23,268 --> 00:36:24,367
I don't know how,

727
00:36:24,403 --> 00:36:26,436
but Jerome is alive,

728
00:36:26,471 --> 00:36:28,071
and I think he's coming after Dwight.

729
00:36:29,875 --> 00:36:31,641
Where's Dwight?

730
00:36:31,677 --> 00:36:33,410
I saw a uni walking him that way. Why?

731
00:36:39,351 --> 00:36:42,719
Hang on, Dwight. We
got a busy night ahead.

732
00:36:42,754 --> 00:36:44,821
What's that?

733
00:36:44,856 --> 00:36:46,823
This guy's hilarious.

734
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:11,179
So... how's it look?

735
00:37:11,215 --> 00:37:13,048
It's good. It looks good.

736
00:37:17,487 --> 00:37:21,623
You wouldn't lie to me, right, Dwight?

737
00:37:21,658 --> 00:37:23,425
No.

738
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,594
It looks good.

739
00:37:25,629 --> 00:37:27,863
It's good.

740
00:37:31,468 --> 00:37:35,270
Say... you're not mad, are you?

741
00:37:35,305 --> 00:37:37,839
Mad?

742
00:37:39,309 --> 00:37:44,045
What could I possibly be mad about? Huh?

743
00:37:44,081 --> 00:37:46,548
You know, the whole
cutting off your face.

744
00:37:46,583 --> 00:37:49,551
Oh, buddy...

745
00:37:49,586 --> 00:37:52,320
you brought me back from the dead.

746
00:37:52,356 --> 00:37:56,024
What's a cutoff face between friends?

747
00:37:56,695 --> 00:37:58,528
I guess that's true.

748
00:37:58,563 --> 00:38:00,562
You guessed right. Bingo.

749
00:38:02,432 --> 00:38:04,666
What are, what are we doing? Ooh.

750
00:38:06,436 --> 00:38:08,336
You'll see.

751
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:16,611
Nothing? He is out
there! Someone has him!

752
00:38:16,647 --> 00:38:19,214
Sorry, boss. Mr. Nygma wasn't at any

753
00:38:19,249 --> 00:38:21,249
of Tommy Bones's or the Duke's hideouts.

754
00:38:21,285 --> 00:38:23,718
Santino. Hit Santino.

755
00:38:23,754 --> 00:38:25,720
He was close with Tommy Bones.

756
00:38:25,756 --> 00:38:27,722
I-I bet they are in this together.

757
00:38:27,758 --> 00:38:29,190
Boss, got to tell you,

758
00:38:29,226 --> 00:38:30,492
I'm hearing some weird things.

759
00:38:30,527 --> 00:38:31,526
Ed is in danger.

760
00:38:31,561 --> 00:38:32,661
I will tear this city apart

761
00:38:32,696 --> 00:38:34,462
brick by brick!

762
00:38:36,233 --> 00:38:37,666
What?

763
00:38:37,701 --> 00:38:39,034
Oswald.

764
00:38:39,069 --> 00:38:41,569
Ed, is that really
you? Are-Are you okay?

765
00:38:41,605 --> 00:38:43,571
I... I can't talk long.

766
00:38:43,607 --> 00:38:45,206
I snuck away to the phone.

767
00:38:45,242 --> 00:38:47,842
Ed, who has you? Where are you?

768
00:38:47,878 --> 00:38:49,577
Kane Chemicals.

769
00:38:49,613 --> 00:38:51,446
Hurry. Oswald, hurry, please.

770
00:38:51,481 --> 00:38:53,882
Ed? Ed?

771
00:38:53,917 --> 00:38:55,016
Ed?

772
00:38:55,052 --> 00:38:56,885
Uh, uh, c-come on.

773
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,354
Now. No, Gabe. Not you.

774
00:38:59,389 --> 00:39:00,956
You stay by the phone
in case he calls back.

775
00:39:00,991 --> 00:39:03,458
Kane Chemicals, let's go. Move!

776
00:39:04,494 --> 00:39:05,860
Nothing on the news van,

777
00:39:05,896 --> 00:39:06,928
but reports are coming in.

778
00:39:06,964 --> 00:39:08,530
Random attacks,

779
00:39:08,565 --> 00:39:11,900
looting... at least six
fires in the past hour.

780
00:39:11,935 --> 00:39:12,968
You're telling me that ding-dong Dwight

781
00:39:13,003 --> 00:39:14,402
actually got people to go ape?

782
00:39:14,438 --> 00:39:16,338
You need to see this.

783
00:39:17,407 --> 00:39:18,873
As has been reported,

784
00:39:18,909 --> 00:39:20,108
Channel 9's van

785
00:39:20,143 --> 00:39:22,110
was stolen this evening.

786
00:39:22,145 --> 00:39:24,112
We are now getting video from the thief,

787
00:39:24,147 --> 00:39:28,149
which we will play in hopes
it leads to his apprehension.

788
00:39:28,185 --> 00:39:29,818
Testing. Testing.

789
00:39:29,853 --> 00:39:31,252
Campos, call Channel 9!

790
00:39:31,288 --> 00:39:33,455
Tell them to stop broadcasting this now!

791
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:35,824
Am I live?

792
00:39:35,859 --> 00:39:37,258
Am I on air?

793
00:39:37,294 --> 00:39:38,994
Can you hear me? Ah, screw it.

794
00:39:39,029 --> 00:39:41,896
Let's do it.

795
00:39:41,932 --> 00:39:43,465
Hi.

796
00:39:44,501 --> 00:39:47,068
Some of you may know, I died.

797
00:39:47,104 --> 00:39:48,470
Uh-oh.

798
00:39:50,207 --> 00:39:54,275
But take it from me, death is...

799
00:39:54,311 --> 00:39:57,579
dull...

800
00:39:57,614 --> 00:39:59,981
but coming back...

801
00:40:00,017 --> 00:40:02,951
that is something.

802
00:40:02,986 --> 00:40:07,622
Leave it to dying to give you
a whole new perspective on life.

803
00:40:09,226 --> 00:40:13,228
And I would like to share that with you.

804
00:40:13,263 --> 00:40:15,463
Uh, Officer, you look terrible.

805
00:40:15,499 --> 00:40:17,032
Hey, you got... oh.

806
00:40:18,068 --> 00:40:19,834
Tonight, Gotham,

807
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:23,004
in the darkness, there are no rules.

808
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,274
So, tonight, Gotham...

809
00:40:26,309 --> 00:40:28,009
do what you want.

810
00:40:28,045 --> 00:40:32,213
Kill who you want. Hmm?

811
00:40:33,984 --> 00:40:37,185
And when morning comes...

812
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:41,723
you, too, shall be...

813
00:40:41,758 --> 00:40:43,625
reborn.

814
00:40:46,196 --> 00:40:48,863
Oh, and, uh... Dwight.

815
00:40:48,899 --> 00:40:52,467
I don't forgive you for my face.

816
00:40:59,376 --> 00:41:00,542
He's at the power
plant across the river.

817
00:41:00,577 --> 00:41:01,843
You'll never make it in time.

818
00:41:01,878 --> 00:41:05,018
Go to the roof. Let me call a chopper.

819
00:41:05,053 --> 00:41:07,281
We need a bird to go now.

820
00:41:41,384 --> 00:41:43,718
Oh, my God.
