00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:13,557
[Damien] Guys? Guys!

4
00:00:14,474 --> 00:00:15,976
- Dad.
- [Ray] I'm sorry, Nora.

5
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:17,519
He died a good man.

6
00:00:17,603 --> 00:00:19,521
[Nora] <i>He died a demon, Ray.</i>

[Gary sings]
<i>Oh, I've been cleaning up some Beebo</i>

8
00:00:24,067 --> 00:00:27,487
<i>Just to scrub the time anomalies away</i>

9
00:00:27,571 --> 00:00:31,950
<i>Hey, can't you see
the blue fluff blowing</i>

10
00:00:32,326 --> 00:00:33,326
Hello?

11
00:00:33,994 --> 00:00:35,412
Who's there?

12
00:00:35,537 --> 00:00:37,737
I'm just gonna use my hand to block out
the sun's glare,

13
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:39,291
so I can see you...

14
00:00:41,084 --> 00:00:42,084
You.

15
00:00:42,669 --> 00:00:43,795
No!

16
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:45,088
No! It can't be you!

17
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,772
[Constantine] The Loom of Fate.

18
00:01:01,855 --> 00:01:04,900
An ancient artifact that has the power
to change any person's life story

19
00:01:04,983 --> 00:01:06,443
without wrecking the timeline.

20
00:01:06,526 --> 00:01:07,819
Anyone's, like...

21
00:01:07,903 --> 00:01:09,321
Astra's.

22
00:01:09,446 --> 00:01:11,698
And we give her a life
where her mum never died,

23
00:01:11,782 --> 00:01:13,909
and where she never goes to Hell.

24
00:01:13,992 --> 00:01:16,328
If you think I'm helping you,
you're daft as a brush.

25
00:01:16,787 --> 00:01:19,164
I destroyed that thing
for a bloody good reason, John-o.

26
00:01:19,248 --> 00:01:20,248
Come on, Sara.

27
00:01:20,332 --> 00:01:22,167
You know this can solve
all of our problems.

28
00:01:22,251 --> 00:01:23,585
It can erase all of the Encores.

29
00:01:23,669 --> 00:01:25,379
Yeah, and make
all of our dreams come true.

30
00:01:26,255 --> 00:01:28,966
John, I'm sorry,
but I'm with Charlie on this one.

31
00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:32,302
That kind of cosmic power
doesn't belong in the hands of anyone.

32
00:01:32,427 --> 00:01:33,804
Astra has made her choices, John.

33
00:01:33,887 --> 00:01:35,514
It's not up to you to undo them.

34
00:01:35,597 --> 00:01:36,597
Now, this...

35
00:01:37,474 --> 00:01:40,477
will be the solution
to our Encore problem.

36
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,021
[Gideon] Captain Lance,
there is a new Encore detected

37
00:01:43,105 --> 00:01:44,898
in Salvation, 1874.

38
00:01:44,982 --> 00:01:47,109
I love my Prognosticator.

39
00:01:47,192 --> 00:01:48,860
All right, Legends,

40
00:01:48,944 --> 00:01:51,863
grab your cowboy hats and leather straps

41
00:01:51,947 --> 00:01:54,616
because we are going to...

42
00:01:55,826 --> 00:01:56,868
Where is everyone?

43
00:01:56,952 --> 00:01:59,621
I, uh, might have got
a bit sentimental on my deathbed

44
00:01:59,705 --> 00:02:01,248
and encouraged Raymond to

45
00:02:01,331 --> 00:02:02,874
carpe his diem.

46
00:02:03,834 --> 00:02:04,834
Nice rock.

47
00:02:05,585 --> 00:02:06,712
She'll love that.

48
00:02:07,713 --> 00:02:09,798
And when she finds it...

49
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:13,468
- I'll pop the question.
- [doorbell rings]

50
00:02:15,554 --> 00:02:17,806
She's here. She's really here.

51
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:19,057
[Ray] Oh, man.

52
00:02:20,559 --> 00:02:21,643
It's really happening.

53
00:02:21,893 --> 00:02:23,312
Our work here is done.

54
00:02:24,688 --> 00:02:26,189
Our boy is all growns up.

55
00:02:38,827 --> 00:02:41,955
Nora Darhk, welcome.

56
00:02:42,247 --> 00:02:44,327
I will have the pleasure
of serving you this evening.

57
00:02:45,292 --> 00:02:47,127
Thanks, Gare.

58
00:02:47,794 --> 00:02:49,671
Whoa.

59
00:02:49,755 --> 00:02:51,089
Wow, Ray.

60
00:02:52,382 --> 00:02:54,885
You really went all out for date night.

61
00:02:56,011 --> 00:02:57,530
[whispers] I thought
we were just having pizza.

62
00:02:57,554 --> 00:03:00,474
Oh. I got a little inspired,
I guess. [chuckles]

63
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,142
Yeah. Yeah, well...

64
00:03:04,686 --> 00:03:06,938
I see Pippa is still your charge.

65
00:03:07,022 --> 00:03:10,525
Yes, until we figure out
her heart's deepest need. [chuckles]

66
00:03:10,609 --> 00:03:11,651
[Pippa grunts]

67
00:03:12,778 --> 00:03:14,196
Big talker, I see.

68
00:03:17,824 --> 00:03:19,368
Defiling the library, I see.

69
00:03:19,701 --> 00:03:22,579
Yeah, well, you know, I've quit smoking,
so, uh, I need a new habit.

70
00:03:22,913 --> 00:03:24,313
- Doing some research?
- Yeah. Yeah.

71
00:03:25,165 --> 00:03:27,209
I need to find the Loom of Fate
to save Astra,

72
00:03:27,292 --> 00:03:30,128
but since Charlie
isn't making it easy for me,

73
00:03:30,212 --> 00:03:32,589
I am doing it the hard way.

74
00:03:32,672 --> 00:03:35,008
- Why not ask an historian?
- [chuckles]

75
00:03:35,092 --> 00:03:37,969
All right then, Mr. Professor, tell me,
what do you know?

76
00:03:38,053 --> 00:03:40,138
Well, when I was in grad school,

77
00:03:40,222 --> 00:03:44,726
my professor showed me a diary
of an explorer named Ernest Shackleton.

78
00:03:45,102 --> 00:03:47,145
Now, Shackleton
was obsessed with the Loom,

79
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:50,357
and he believed a piece of it
was buried under the South Pole.

80
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,277
So, if I'm to find the Loom,
I've got to search the South Pole.

81
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,030
Shackleton thought so.

82
00:03:57,197 --> 00:03:58,615
Bloody hell.

83
00:03:59,074 --> 00:04:00,158
Nice one, mate.

84
00:04:00,951 --> 00:04:02,619
Don't worry, John.

85
00:04:02,702 --> 00:04:05,163
We'll figure out another way
to help you and Astra.

86
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,709
That ought to cool his jets.

87
00:04:13,046 --> 00:04:14,256
Hey, Mick.

88
00:04:14,339 --> 00:04:17,217
Saddle up. We're going to the Wild West.

89
00:04:17,426 --> 00:04:19,469
- [object thuds]
- [Mick grunts]

90
00:04:19,553 --> 00:04:20,679
Is everything okay in there?

91
00:04:20,762 --> 00:04:22,347
- [object thuds]
- [Mick grunts]

92
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,516
He's been in there for days.

93
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:26,059
What are you still doing here?

94
00:04:26,143 --> 00:04:27,143
Exfoliating.

95
00:04:27,185 --> 00:04:28,185
[object clatters]

96
00:04:28,186 --> 00:04:30,063
Mick, get out here right now!

97
00:04:32,023 --> 00:04:32,941
What?

98
00:04:32,942 --> 00:04:34,068
What is going on?

99
00:04:34,151 --> 00:04:36,111
Someone's trashing
Rebecca Silver online.

100
00:04:36,194 --> 00:04:37,279
Oh, cute. You have a troll.

101
00:04:37,362 --> 00:04:38,482
What's wrong with your face?

102
00:04:41,366 --> 00:04:43,160
Zari, your mission is to help Mick.

103
00:04:43,243 --> 00:04:45,078
Okay. I have so many makeover ideas.

104
00:04:45,162 --> 00:04:46,788
With his troll problem.

105
00:04:46,872 --> 00:04:48,415
[clears throat]

106
00:04:55,088 --> 00:04:56,798
Did I just fritz out of existence?

107
00:04:57,549 --> 00:04:58,549
[train horn blares]

108
00:04:59,926 --> 00:05:03,638

109
00:05:03,722 --> 00:05:04,723
[gasps]

110
00:05:04,806 --> 00:05:06,558
Please! Help me. Untie me.

111
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:08,101
I'm too beautiful to die so young.

112
00:05:08,185 --> 00:05:10,228
- Train's coming!
- [Gary screaming]

113
00:05:16,067 --> 00:05:18,820
Oh, my God! Oh, God! The train!

114
00:05:18,945 --> 00:05:22,115
Oh, God! Director Sharpe, you saved me.

115
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:24,367
- Okay.
- [gasping]

116
00:05:24,451 --> 00:05:25,744
Wait... Wait a second.

117
00:05:26,328 --> 00:05:27,787
Did you just say "Director Sharpe"?

118
00:05:27,871 --> 00:05:29,080
Yeah.

119
00:05:29,164 --> 00:05:30,332
Gary, what year are you from?

120
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,460
The present. 2018.

121
00:05:33,543 --> 00:05:34,937
Okay, listen.
I need you to tell us who did this,

122
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:36,689
and then immediately
courier back to the Bureau.

123
00:05:36,713 --> 00:05:37,839
I can't.

124
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,467
He stole my Time Courier.

125
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:42,009
Who?

126
00:05:43,136 --> 00:05:44,513
[doorbell rings]

127
00:05:52,395 --> 00:05:54,147
Hi, Nora-doll.

128
00:05:54,898 --> 00:05:56,107
Daddy's home.

129
00:05:58,777 --> 00:05:59,777
Dad.

130
00:06:04,908 --> 00:06:09,621
Oh, Nora-doll, I missed you so much.

131
00:06:09,704 --> 00:06:12,457
This is amazing. How are you...

132
00:06:12,624 --> 00:06:14,793
[voice wavers] You are an Encore.

133
00:06:14,876 --> 00:06:16,556
Look, all I know is,
I'm up here right now,

134
00:06:16,586 --> 00:06:19,506
as part of some
soul-harvesting pyramid scheme.

135
00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:21,841
Honestly, I can't keep up
with these millennials

136
00:06:21,925 --> 00:06:24,511
and all their newfangled
world-domination plans.

137
00:06:24,594 --> 00:06:26,846
So, you're doing
the whole villain thing again.

138
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,390
Well, you... No, I mean...

139
00:06:28,473 --> 00:06:30,433
Part of my parole agreement.

140
00:06:31,184 --> 00:06:34,437
But after spending two years in Hell
worrying about my little girl,

141
00:06:34,521 --> 00:06:37,190
I had to come and see you first.

142
00:06:37,274 --> 00:06:38,692
But look at this place!

143
00:06:39,526 --> 00:06:41,987
You must be a master sorceress by now.

144
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,280
Oh, yeah, yeah.

145
00:06:43,363 --> 00:06:45,615
This is just a place where I hang my hat

146
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:47,409
and do my dark rituals.

147
00:06:47,784 --> 00:06:49,035
"Dark rituals."

148
00:06:49,119 --> 00:06:51,371
How did you find me? Blood magic?

149
00:06:51,454 --> 00:06:52,914
Your Palmer Tech watch.

150
00:06:52,998 --> 00:06:54,916
It still has location-sharing on.

151
00:06:55,584 --> 00:06:57,168
Palmer Tech, right.

152
00:06:57,752 --> 00:06:58,752
[Nora] Ray!

153
00:06:59,212 --> 00:07:01,131
Sorry for the delay.
Gary seems to have run off.

154
00:07:01,214 --> 00:07:02,465
My dad's here.

155
00:07:02,549 --> 00:07:04,050
- What?
- My dad's here!

156
00:07:04,134 --> 00:07:06,136
- Your dad's here?
- Shh!

157
00:07:06,219 --> 00:07:07,637
Oh, man. Is he an Encore?

158
00:07:08,305 --> 00:07:11,057
Oh, man. And Sara
just found herself a Hell Sword.

159
00:07:11,141 --> 00:07:12,326
- Which means...
- She'll kill him.

160
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,078
- What do we do? What do we do?
- You have to leave.

161
00:07:14,102 --> 00:07:15,060
- What about Pippa?
- Pippa.

162
00:07:15,061 --> 00:07:16,061
- Pippa!
- Pippa.

163
00:07:16,062 --> 00:07:16,980
You have to take her.

164
00:07:16,981 --> 00:07:21,443
You have to keep her comfortable,
so that she doesn't summon me.

165
00:07:21,526 --> 00:07:22,587
That's it. That's gonna work.

166
00:07:22,611 --> 00:07:23,987
- [gasps] Thanks, Ray.
- Okay.

167
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,824
"Rebecca Silver knows as much about love

168
00:07:27,907 --> 00:07:30,827
as a teenage boy's
sock drawer." [chuckles]

169
00:07:32,287 --> 00:07:36,833
[sighs] Okay. Bad reviews,
they just come with celebrity.

170
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:39,312
You should have heard
what they said about my perfume

171
00:07:39,336 --> 00:07:41,212
when it made people
bleed out their noses.

172
00:07:41,338 --> 00:07:43,965
[grunts] He's gonna get more than
a bloody nose.

173
00:07:44,049 --> 00:07:46,718
No. Don't stoop to his level.

174
00:07:46,801 --> 00:07:51,306
Inside every troll is the heart of a fan
just dying for some attention.

175
00:07:52,682 --> 00:07:54,643
And some swag.

176
00:07:54,726 --> 00:07:56,061
One signed book,

177
00:07:56,144 --> 00:07:58,897
and he'll be
a Rebecca Silver stan forever.

178
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:01,566
[Ray chuckles] Ta-da!

179
00:08:01,816 --> 00:08:02,901
What's that?

180
00:08:03,026 --> 00:08:06,738
Oh, this is a TV show
I used to watch when I was a kid.

181
00:08:06,821 --> 00:08:09,574
It really helped me dig deep
and communicate my feelings better.

182
00:08:10,742 --> 00:08:12,827
It's called
<i>Mister Parker's Cul De Sac,</i>

183
00:08:12,911 --> 00:08:14,511
and I think you're really gonna like it.

184
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:23,755
<i>- Hi.</i>
- [show theme music playing]

185
00:08:23,838 --> 00:08:27,050
[sings] <i>Welcome to my cul-de-sac, friend</i>

186
00:08:27,467 --> 00:08:30,178
<i>That's a street that ends in a circle</i>

187
00:08:30,929 --> 00:08:33,807
<i>The thing about circles is
they never end</i>

188
00:08:34,391 --> 00:08:37,644
<i>So our friendship will be universal</i>

189
00:08:37,727 --> 00:08:39,813
This is very dumb.

190
00:08:39,896 --> 00:08:40,939
<i>Hi, boys and girls.</i>

191
00:08:41,022 --> 00:08:43,858
Well, just give it a chance, okay?

192
00:08:43,942 --> 00:08:47,320

ourselves a wonderful...</i>

And... [clears throat]

194
00:08:49,322 --> 00:08:50,615
how about 20 bucks?

195
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:53,118
I'll be right back.

196

[sighs]

198
00:08:58,873 --> 00:09:00,250
[Nate exclaims excitedly]

199
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,502
So? Bachelor party?

200
00:09:02,585 --> 00:09:06,673
No. Nora's dad literally
came back from the dead

201
00:09:06,756 --> 00:09:08,425
and ruined the evening.

202
00:09:08,508 --> 00:09:10,009
Damien Darhk? [sighs]

203
00:09:10,802 --> 00:09:13,030
Anyway, Nora said she can handle it,
and so, she's handling it.

204
00:09:13,054 --> 00:09:14,681
But we can't let anyone interfere.

205
00:09:14,764 --> 00:09:16,158
- Especially not Sara.
- [Behrad] I mean,

206
00:09:16,182 --> 00:09:18,268
he is your future father-in-law.

207
00:09:18,768 --> 00:09:20,162
You don't think we could talk Sara down?

208
00:09:20,186 --> 00:09:22,981
When I see Damien Darhk,
I'm gonna kill him for good this time.

209
00:09:23,064 --> 00:09:24,107
What about Nora?

210
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:26,234
Well, ideally, she never finds out.

211
00:09:26,317 --> 00:09:27,694
Gideon, any hits?

212
00:09:27,777 --> 00:09:30,739
[Gideon] Yes, Captain. In fact,
I'm detecting new Encore activity

213
00:09:30,822 --> 00:09:32,699
at Constantine's home in 2020.

214
00:09:32,782 --> 00:09:34,492
All right, let's do this discreetly.

215
00:09:34,576 --> 00:09:37,328
Just us, no boys.
You know how sentimental they can get.

216
00:09:37,412 --> 00:09:38,328
[Agent Sharpe] Yep.

217
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:41,291
You also received a call
from a Wild Dog while you were away.

218
00:09:41,374 --> 00:09:43,042
Yep, got it. Thanks, Gideon.

219
00:09:43,126 --> 00:09:44,294
What was that all about?

220
00:09:44,377 --> 00:09:45,628
Oh, I'm sure it's nothing.

221
00:09:47,172 --> 00:09:48,882
This is extremely pornographic.

222
00:09:49,716 --> 00:09:51,176
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

223
00:09:51,301 --> 00:09:52,469
[laptop chimes]

224
00:09:54,429 --> 00:09:55,531
[Zari] Ooh, troll made a post.

225
00:09:55,555 --> 00:09:57,807
Must have gotten his swag back.

226
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:01,144
Oh, look,
he's showing off your signature.

227
00:10:01,227 --> 00:10:02,687
This is perfect.

228
00:10:06,024 --> 00:10:07,150
[gasps]

229
00:10:07,901 --> 00:10:09,027
What the...

230
00:10:09,652 --> 00:10:10,653
[sighs]

231
00:10:12,238 --> 00:10:15,241
[gasps] That little punk.

232
00:10:16,284 --> 00:10:18,077
Okay. Change of tactic.

233
00:10:18,828 --> 00:10:20,079
[Mick] What are you doing?

234
00:10:20,163 --> 00:10:23,333
Scouring the metadata from his posts
to composite his location.

235
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:25,043
- You hack?
- No.

236
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,553
- It's a girl.
- It's okay. Just go.

237
00:10:36,012 --> 00:10:36,970
Do you know who I am?

238
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:38,451
Yeah, what are you doing here, Becky?

239
00:10:40,016 --> 00:10:43,978
"I am Rebecca Silver, and you will
listen to me, you pimple-faced..."

240
00:10:44,062 --> 00:10:45,790
- But she doesn't have pimples.
- Just go. Keep going.

Uh, what... what the hell
have you done with your life,

244
00:10:53,238 --> 00:10:54,781
and who are you to judge others?"

Mick, why... Why are you here?

Why are you here?

I live here.

Why is she filming us?

This your kid?

252
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,506
Well, I guess, since you're here,
I might as well tell you.

253
00:11:12,841 --> 00:11:14,008
She's your kid, too.

254
00:11:15,385 --> 00:11:17,178
This is Lita, your daughter.

[Damien] Mmm.

That was my wizard's tower.

I love it.

You can just smell
the dark forces at work in here.

- Ooh. Safe neighborhood?
- Super safe.

262

People just mostly keep to themselves.

[Damien] Good. You know what
the worst kind of neighbors are?

- Kids.
- Ooh. Hate kids.

00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:56,676
You know, all I've ever asked for
are neighbors I don't have to kill.

267
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:58,359
- [Nora] Hmm.
- But for people like us...

268
00:11:59,345 --> 00:12:02,682
sometimes, it's kill or be killed.

- [Nora] You know what?
- Mmm?

- [Nora] Better safe than sorry.

Right, Dad?

What was that?

You know what?

277
00:12:18,781 --> 00:12:21,701
I have a surprise for you in the study.

Yes, I saw you!

Listen, I know
you're here to kill my dad.

And I know you have good reason.

But I'm asking you, as my friends,

283
00:12:38,551 --> 00:12:41,888
just to give me this one night
to handle it my way.

284
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,432
And what exactly is your way?

Women. People. Hench-people.

289
00:12:56,611 --> 00:12:58,863
Wait a minute. Are you saying
the head of the Time Bureau

290
00:12:58,947 --> 00:13:01,991
and the Captain of the <i>Waverider</i>
work for you now?

291
00:13:02,075 --> 00:13:04,577
Well, I can be very convincing.

292
00:13:06,371 --> 00:13:07,664
Ooh.

Mmm-hmm.

Eleventh century Mongolia,
if I'm not mistaken.

297

Oh, yeah! That's just a little something
they picked up for me.

298
00:13:26,307 --> 00:13:28,434
Thanks. It's not for indoor use, though.

299
00:13:28,518 --> 00:13:29,894
So, I'm just gonna...

300

for playing along.

[Damien] Tick-tock, ladies.

304
00:13:41,155 --> 00:13:43,408
I could really use that cocktail
about now.

305
00:13:43,491 --> 00:13:45,827
Remind me again why
I shouldn't go in there right now,

306
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,537
and stab him with Khan's sword.

307
00:13:47,912 --> 00:13:48,912
He's my dad.

308
00:13:48,913 --> 00:13:51,633
He's also one of the most powerful
dark warlocks on the planet, so...

309
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:54,460
Wait. What if he was just a man?

310
00:13:54,544 --> 00:13:55,920
- Hmm?
- What?

311
00:13:56,004 --> 00:13:57,690
There's a potion
that can strip him of his powers.

312
00:13:57,714 --> 00:13:58,714
It's complicated to make,

313
00:13:58,715 --> 00:14:00,475
but there are ingredients
here in this house.

314
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,750
I know we can make it work.
We can put it in his dinner.

315
00:14:04,846 --> 00:14:06,726
- I volunteer as tribute.
- [Agent Sharpe] Gary.

316
00:14:06,806 --> 00:14:08,391
What the hell are you doing in there?

317
00:14:08,474 --> 00:14:11,352
I was cowering, from the man
who almost killed me with the train.

318
00:14:11,436 --> 00:14:12,478
[Agent Sharpe sighs]

319
00:14:12,562 --> 00:14:15,732
Give me the recipe to your potion,
I will not fail you.

320
00:14:15,815 --> 00:14:16,983
- Bad idea.
- Uh-huh.

321
00:14:17,275 --> 00:14:19,360
- Do it for book club.
- What?

322
00:14:19,444 --> 00:14:21,284
Are you seriously
invoking book club right now?

323
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:22,530
Yeah.

324
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,200
You get one of those.

325
00:14:26,284 --> 00:14:28,369
You get one. Are you sure?

326
00:14:28,536 --> 00:14:30,747
Ava, I am invoking book club...

327
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:33,416
to ask you to give me
one night with my dad.

328
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,795
And if he is a harmless,
normal man by the end of it...

329
00:14:39,464 --> 00:14:40,590
you let him live.

330
00:14:48,723 --> 00:14:50,600
- Where are you going, Captain Cold?
- [sighs]

331
00:14:50,725 --> 00:14:52,143
Antarctica, of course.

332
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:53,370
Ugh. That place is the worst.

333
00:14:53,394 --> 00:14:55,313
But I'm following up
on the lead that you...

334
00:14:58,316 --> 00:15:00,026
Bloody shapeshifters.

335
00:15:01,861 --> 00:15:02,779
What?

336
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:06,366
Charlie. She used your face
to send me on some dead-end trail.

337
00:15:07,033 --> 00:15:09,118
Send me to Antarctica.

338
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:12,580
Freeze my bloody arse off!

339
00:15:13,164 --> 00:15:16,292
No! I'm getting off
this gormless jam jar.

340
00:15:16,751 --> 00:15:17,751
[sighs]

341
00:15:17,752 --> 00:15:20,463
Since there's no one here
that can help me, I'll do it my way.

342
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,714
Alone.

343
00:15:23,633 --> 00:15:26,427
[Sara] All right. I think I got
these stupid crostinis right.

344
00:15:26,511 --> 00:15:27,553
How's the salad?

345
00:15:27,637 --> 00:15:30,139
Uh, it just needs to be dressed,
and then there's the soup.

346
00:15:30,223 --> 00:15:31,891
How many courses did Ray have planned?

347
00:15:32,016 --> 00:15:34,435
By my count, five.
Six if you include cocktails.

348
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:37,814
Come on, Ray.
Nobody gets laid after six courses.

349
00:15:37,897 --> 00:15:39,041
Gary, how's the potion coming along?

350
00:15:39,065 --> 00:15:40,751
Don't rush me.
Everything has to be done precisely

351
00:15:40,775 --> 00:15:41,691
or it will not work.

352
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:42,985
Okay. Are you talking entree...

353
00:15:43,069 --> 00:15:44,362
It'll be done by dessert.

354
00:15:45,071 --> 00:15:47,281
Then let's get this dinner started.

355
00:15:50,243 --> 00:15:54,413
[cell phone vibrating]

356
00:15:59,168 --> 00:16:02,505
Hello, you've reached the office
of Sara Lance. How can I help you?

357
00:16:02,672 --> 00:16:05,424
Hello, Mr. Dog.
What is this in reference to?

358
00:16:05,508 --> 00:16:08,010
- Mmm, cheers.
- Mmm.

359
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:11,514
- [Damien] Mmm.
- [Nora] Mmm.

360
00:16:11,597 --> 00:16:12,723
Oh, more crostinis!

361
00:16:12,807 --> 00:16:14,350
- [tray clatters]
- [Damien laughs]

362
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:16,978
These are delicious.

363
00:16:17,436 --> 00:16:19,730
- [Constantine] Bloody hell. Gary!
- [Nora coughs]

364
00:16:27,864 --> 00:16:29,157
Damien Darhk.

365
00:16:29,824 --> 00:16:31,951
John Constantine.

366
00:16:33,619 --> 00:16:36,164
You know, I don't think
we've actually ever met before,

367
00:16:36,247 --> 00:16:38,416
seeing as you're still breathing.

368
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:40,793
But you have died before, though, right?

369
00:16:41,836 --> 00:16:44,839
So, what's about to happen
should feel a little, uh...

370
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:46,090
familiar.

371
00:16:51,262 --> 00:16:52,305
<i>Remitte istud.</i>

372
00:16:52,388 --> 00:16:53,890
[grunts]

373
00:16:57,226 --> 00:16:58,311
[chuckles]

374
00:16:58,978 --> 00:17:00,479
That was an heirloom, you...

375
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,231
Stop it! Both of you.

376
00:17:02,315 --> 00:17:03,941
This vagrant is trespassing.

377
00:17:04,025 --> 00:17:06,152
This is my house, you plonker.

378
00:17:06,235 --> 00:17:07,570
Your house? Nora, I thought...

379
00:17:07,653 --> 00:17:08,821
Well...

380
00:17:10,198 --> 00:17:13,659
technically, it is his house.

381
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:16,537
His name is on the title.

382
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:19,582
But, in practice...

383
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:22,752
it's our house.

384
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,341
Right, babe?

385
00:17:29,634 --> 00:17:30,927
[mouths] Just go with it.

386
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:34,388
- Right, love. My love, that is...
- [Nora sighs]

387
00:17:34,472 --> 00:17:37,642
because we are indeed, uh, together.

388
00:17:37,725 --> 00:17:38,809
Oh, Nora-doll.

389
00:17:38,893 --> 00:17:41,103
Here, I thought you were all alone.

390
00:17:41,187 --> 00:17:42,897
But now, I know

391
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:47,401
that you have a powerful
warlock in your life.

392
00:17:47,485 --> 00:17:50,071
- Johnny C, you bring it in here.
- [both chuckle]

393
00:17:50,154 --> 00:17:52,782
You rascal! [laughs]

394
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:56,410
<i>The thing about circles is
They never end</i>

395
00:17:56,953 --> 00:17:59,497
<i>So our friendship will be universal</i>

396
00:17:59,956 --> 00:18:01,958
Why does he keep changing his shoes?

397
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,752
Changing his shoes is a soothing ritual

398
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:07,088
which takes him
from one space to another.

399
00:18:07,672 --> 00:18:09,257
Where's my fairy godmother?

400
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,133
She's busy with her father.

401
00:18:11,217 --> 00:18:13,010
So, why are you here and not there?

402
00:18:13,094 --> 00:18:14,512
She asked me to give them space,

403
00:18:14,595 --> 00:18:17,056
and I am respecting her boundaries.

404
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:19,308
She's hiding you from her dad.

405
00:18:20,393 --> 00:18:23,187
Mr. Parker says you can love
whoever you want to love

406
00:18:23,271 --> 00:18:24,855
and to not be ashamed.

407
00:18:24,981 --> 00:18:29,694
[chuckles] You don't have to quote
Season 8, Episode 15 to me.

408
00:18:29,777 --> 00:18:34,031
Okay? But look,
she's not trying to hide...

409
00:18:34,115 --> 00:18:37,827
[in sing-song voice]
Fairy godmother! Fairy godmother!

410
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,829
- Come here, right now!
- Shh!

411
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,080
[splutters]

412
00:18:42,832 --> 00:18:44,917
Damn it, Ray! I said no summoning.

413
00:18:45,001 --> 00:18:46,186
Do you have any idea how many plates

414
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,771
I'm spinning right now,
trying to keep my dad happy?

415
00:18:47,795 --> 00:18:50,256
Many. But quick question.

416
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:52,341
Um, are you hiding me?

417
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:56,345
Of course I am. I am telling him
a thousand lies right now,

418
00:18:56,429 --> 00:18:58,097
to make sure nobody gets killed.

419
00:18:58,848 --> 00:19:02,935
Oh, well...
why not just tell him the truth?

420
00:19:03,019 --> 00:19:04,645
Ooh! Oh!

421
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,355
"Why not just tell him the truth?"

422
00:19:06,856 --> 00:19:10,526
Okay. Why don't I
just tell my megalomaniac dad

423
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:13,279
that his little girl is a slave
to the whims of children

424
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:14,682
and is schtupping an Eagle Scout?

425
00:19:15,197 --> 00:19:17,283
That sounds amazing.

426
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:19,250
The longer you lie
about who you really are...

427
00:19:19,285 --> 00:19:20,345
- [sighs]
- ...the harder it's gonna be

428
00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:22,371
when the truth finally comes out.

429
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:25,624
Listen, can you just
give me this one night?

430
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,918
Okay? Just help me out.

431
00:19:28,002 --> 00:19:30,838
And save the guilt trip? Please.

432
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:32,340
- Okay?
- Of course.

433
00:19:32,423 --> 00:19:34,675
- Okay? Good? Everything good?
- Of course.

434
00:19:35,176 --> 00:19:37,094
[sighs] Okay. Great.

435
00:19:39,764 --> 00:19:40,890
<i>Good night, boys and girls.</i>

436
00:19:40,973 --> 00:19:42,600
Do you need to change your shoes?

437
00:19:44,727 --> 00:19:45,936
I think I do.

438
00:19:50,733 --> 00:19:52,651
I named her Lita, after, uh...

439
00:19:52,735 --> 00:19:55,196
Yeah. Lita Ford of The Runaways.

440
00:19:55,988 --> 00:19:57,239
Sorry I never told you.

441
00:19:57,323 --> 00:19:59,634
Actually, I looked you up
after I found out I was pregnant,

442
00:19:59,658 --> 00:20:00,826
but you were in jail.

443
00:20:02,453 --> 00:20:03,453
Again.

444
00:20:05,998 --> 00:20:07,083
So, it, um...

445
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:11,253
It must have been challenging, uh,
raising a kid by yourself.

446
00:20:11,337 --> 00:20:12,713
I made it work.

447
00:20:12,797 --> 00:20:15,108
Sure, Lita would ask about her dad,
but whenever she did...

448
00:20:15,132 --> 00:20:16,342
She would just say, you know,

449
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:18,511
"My standards were low
and his sperm count was high."

450
00:20:18,594 --> 00:20:19,594
[sniffs]

451
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,472
- Oh, God.
- But, uh...

452
00:20:21,847 --> 00:20:24,433
when I learned that
Rebecca Silver was actually him,

453
00:20:24,517 --> 00:20:27,019
I guess I let it slip that we had
hooked up at our reunion.

454
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:31,399
Lita's a smart kid.
I guess she figured it out.

455
00:20:31,482 --> 00:20:33,150
Yeah. My dad writes crappy novels.

456
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:35,653
- They're brilliant.
- Debatable.

457
00:20:36,904 --> 00:20:38,406
Either way, I still hate you.

458
00:20:38,948 --> 00:20:41,075
Lita, he... he didn't know.

459
00:20:42,076 --> 00:20:44,161
But I guess now that
the pussycat's out of the pouch,

460
00:20:44,245 --> 00:20:46,080
guess you two
can get to know one another.

461
00:20:46,163 --> 00:20:47,163
[scoffs]

462
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,375
Sounds like fun.

463
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:56,298
No! What the hell are you doing?

464
00:20:56,382 --> 00:20:57,382
We were never here.

465
00:21:00,803 --> 00:21:02,096
[Constantine] True story, that.

466
00:21:02,805 --> 00:21:04,140
[Damien] I never knew that...

467
00:21:04,557 --> 00:21:06,392
[both chuckling]

468
00:21:07,518 --> 00:21:08,769
Wine!

469
00:21:09,145 --> 00:21:10,145
Ooh.

470
00:21:10,187 --> 00:21:12,648
Good to see you two getting along.

471
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:14,567
Oh, we're just telling stories,
aren't we?

472
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,986
You know, I shouldn't be shocked
that you'd be drawn

473
00:21:17,069 --> 00:21:19,655
to a fellow after your pop's
old line of work.

474
00:21:19,738 --> 00:21:20,990
Oh, well, you know me, Dad.

475
00:21:21,073 --> 00:21:22,953
I can't help
but keep the family business going.

476
00:21:22,992 --> 00:21:23,992
That's my girl.

477
00:21:23,993 --> 00:21:26,662
Not that I could ever live up
to a great collector

478
00:21:26,745 --> 00:21:28,581
- of artifacts such as yourself.
- Mmm.

479
00:21:28,664 --> 00:21:32,209
But sadly, some things
could never be found.

480
00:21:32,376 --> 00:21:35,337
Take for instance, the Loom of Fate.

481
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:37,046
[clears throat]

482
00:21:37,047 --> 00:21:38,466
I never did find that one.

483
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:41,376
That's because it was scattered
across the multi-verse.

484
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:44,013
Ah, well, it's all on one Earth now.

485
00:21:44,096 --> 00:21:45,096
Ours.

486
00:21:45,097 --> 00:21:46,097
[Damien] Mmm.

487
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:50,478
Intriguing. Still, you'd need a Fate
to put it all together and operate it.

488
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:55,024
Right. Sounds like there's no point
in even looking for it, right, John?

489
00:21:55,149 --> 00:21:57,860
Yeah, especially with so many
exciting opportunities

490
00:21:57,943 --> 00:21:59,236
to think about, right, babe?

491
00:22:00,571 --> 00:22:02,323
Yep. Maybe not the time.

492
00:22:02,781 --> 00:22:05,743
I'm sensing something juicy
bubbling with the help.

493
00:22:05,868 --> 00:22:07,870
- Mmm, no, I don't...
- [bottle slams]

494
00:22:08,162 --> 00:22:09,997
Is there trouble in paradise?

495
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,208
You know what?
It's none of your damn business.

496
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:16,128
Oh, sit and spill. Uncle Damien
wants to hear everything.

497
00:22:16,212 --> 00:22:17,838
No, they don't have to...

498
00:22:17,922 --> 00:22:18,964
You know what?

499
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:21,717
Someone forgot to tell their girlfriend

500
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,428
about a job offer they received
to work in Star City.

501
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,971
- Babe.
- Permanently.

502
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:32,520
I was going to talk to you about it
before it became permanent.

503
00:22:32,603 --> 00:22:34,323
- So, you're actually considering it?
- Yes.

504
00:22:34,396 --> 00:22:36,291
I don't... Okay, how is that supposed
to work with you there

505
00:22:36,315 --> 00:22:38,484
and me, one of Nora's hench-people?

506
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:40,819
Sara, she's right. You know,

507
00:22:40,903 --> 00:22:42,863
long-distance relationships
can be tough.

508
00:22:42,947 --> 00:22:43,947
Thank you.

509
00:22:43,948 --> 00:22:46,116
It wasn't going
to be a long-distance relationship.

510
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,202
I thought that we could go together.

511
00:22:48,285 --> 00:22:49,954
This... This is why I always have

512
00:22:50,037 --> 00:22:52,915
a no-fraternizing policy with my staff.

513
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,209
- Mmm. Next course, please.
- [Damien] Mmm.

514
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,631
The potion is now purple,
and therefore...

515
00:23:02,007 --> 00:23:04,760
ready to de-power the supervillain.

516
00:23:10,224 --> 00:23:11,642
So, let me get this straight.

517
00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:14,103
You stood up for yourself,
and she shut you down?

518
00:23:15,604 --> 00:23:18,607
She just... doesn't think
that Damien would accept me.

519
00:23:18,691 --> 00:23:21,318
But aren't you setting yourself up
for a lifetime of lies?

520
00:23:22,027 --> 00:23:23,907
Will you have to lie
when Damien comes to visit?

521
00:23:23,946 --> 00:23:25,614
Or when you guys have kids?

522
00:23:25,698 --> 00:23:28,993
Because you know those babies are going
to have that beautiful Palmer jawline.

523
00:23:29,076 --> 00:23:30,595
The Palmer jawline is a dominant gene.

524
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:31,996
Damn right.

525
00:23:33,956 --> 00:23:35,791
- Am I rushing into this?
- [yells] Yes!

526
00:23:40,337 --> 00:23:42,881
We couldn't say something
unless you said something. Ray...

527
00:23:45,426 --> 00:23:47,136
It feels rushed.

528
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:49,430
She's embarrassed of you.

529
00:23:49,513 --> 00:23:52,016
After you made the perfect dinner,
took a massage class,

530
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:53,699
and hid an engagement ring
in the mousse?

531
00:23:55,019 --> 00:23:56,854
The ring is in the mousse!

532
00:23:57,646 --> 00:23:59,857
[Nora] Well, I hope you
saved room for dessert.

533
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:02,943
[gasps] Chocolate mousse.

534
00:24:03,027 --> 00:24:04,945
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

535
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:08,991
[Agent Sharpe] Yeah, you should try it.

536
00:24:09,074 --> 00:24:10,951
[mouths] Don't eat the mousse.

537
00:24:11,035 --> 00:24:13,054
- [Sara] Perfection!
- [Damien] There's no chocolate in Hell.

538
00:24:13,078 --> 00:24:14,913
[Damien groans] Mousse!

539
00:24:15,914 --> 00:24:17,041
- [Nora whispers]
- Hmm?

540
00:24:17,124 --> 00:24:18,584
- What's that?
- Mmm.

541
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:21,503
Chocolate mousse. This has always
been your favorite, right, Dad?

542
00:24:22,421 --> 00:24:24,131
This just looks sinful.

543
00:24:24,214 --> 00:24:25,654
- [Agent Sharpe] Mmm.
- [Damien] Mmm.

544
00:24:26,467 --> 00:24:28,886
[Nora] Everybody, isn't this delicious?

545
00:24:28,969 --> 00:24:29,970
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

546
00:24:31,847 --> 00:24:32,973
[Sara] Perfection!

547
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,269
[coughing]

548
00:24:39,021 --> 00:24:40,021
[Damien] A ring?

549
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:42,691
Well, that's unexpected.

550
00:24:51,909 --> 00:24:54,495
I'm surmising that perhaps,

551
00:24:54,578 --> 00:24:57,915
that cup was put
in front of the wrong person.

552
00:24:57,998 --> 00:25:00,626
John, was there a question
that you wanted to ask?

553
00:25:00,709 --> 00:25:01,709
"Question"?

554
00:25:02,544 --> 00:25:04,004
Oh, right, yeah!

555
00:25:04,088 --> 00:25:05,004
Um... [clears throat]

556
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:06,799
Question, of course.

557
00:25:06,882 --> 00:25:07,882
[chuckles]

558
00:25:10,386 --> 00:25:11,386
[clears throat]

559
00:25:18,143 --> 00:25:19,478
Nora Darhk, uh...

560
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:22,439
- will you marry me?
- [Damien squeals]

561
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:24,817
[Damien exclaims]

562
00:25:24,818 --> 00:25:27,486
Just when I thought this night
couldn't get any better,

563
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:30,698
my daughter has found
the love of her life.

564
00:25:30,781 --> 00:25:33,450
Forget the mousse. More champagne!

565
00:25:33,534 --> 00:25:34,535
No.

566
00:25:36,203 --> 00:25:38,330
What? What? I'm sorry, what was that?

567
00:25:38,914 --> 00:25:40,582
- I thought you said no.
- No.

568
00:25:42,418 --> 00:25:45,170
[Damien] Okay, she said...
Did she say "no"?

569
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:50,175
No, I won't marry John,

570
00:25:50,634 --> 00:25:52,070
because I can't lie to you anymore, Dad.

571
00:25:52,094 --> 00:25:53,010
Oh, thank God.

572
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:55,305
Johnny C, Johnny C, Johnny C,
don't... What are you doing?

573
00:25:55,389 --> 00:25:57,808
Dad, Sara and Ava aren't my henchwomen.

574
00:25:58,851 --> 00:26:00,144
They're just my friends.

575
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:06,400
[chuckles]
I'm not a powerful sorceress.

576
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:12,114
I'm a fairy godmother.

577
00:26:13,824 --> 00:26:15,367
Dad, this isn't my house.

578
00:26:16,535 --> 00:26:18,662
John isn't my boyfriend.

579
00:26:20,581 --> 00:26:21,581
He is.

580
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,671
And I love him madly.

581
00:26:28,797 --> 00:26:32,050
Hi, Damien... Mr. Darhk.

582
00:26:32,134 --> 00:26:36,346
Since you're here, I was wondering
if I could get your blessing

583
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:40,559
to have your
daughter's hand in marriage?

584
00:26:45,606 --> 00:26:48,442
You deceived me, Nora-doll.

585
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:50,819
Your own father.

586
00:27:00,037 --> 00:27:01,663
You tried to poison me.

587
00:27:01,747 --> 00:27:04,666
That's... That's not as bad as it looks.

588
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:07,628
I've been gone
for less than two years, and you...

589
00:27:08,337 --> 00:27:09,922
You're a completely different person.

590
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:17,262
And I know who's to blame.

591
00:27:18,138 --> 00:27:21,892
[Nora] No, no, no, no. Dad! Stop! Stop!

Did you think you were gonna kill me
with that little toy, Lance?

No, he didn't. That was my idea.

That's because he twisted you.

00:30:12,437 --> 00:30:14,690
Now, why don't we discuss our problems?

642
00:30:14,773 --> 00:30:16,900
Damien, what seems to be on your mind?

643
00:30:16,984 --> 00:30:20,362
Well, you simpleton,
my child means everything to me,

644
00:30:20,445 --> 00:30:22,864
and you've completely
corrupted her into this!

645
00:30:22,948 --> 00:30:25,492
See, this is why I had to lie.
I knew you couldn't handle it

646
00:30:25,575 --> 00:30:27,536
because emotionally, you're the child!

647
00:30:27,786 --> 00:30:31,081
Well, I think this is gonna be
tougher than we thought, kids.

648
00:30:31,373 --> 00:30:33,101
Why don't we travel
to the Land of Make 'Em Ups

649
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:35,669
with Gary,
the Unspeakable Train Abomination?

[chugging]

651
00:30:37,879 --> 00:30:38,797
[Ray] Hi, Gary.

652
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:40,966
[tooting] Toot, toot, everybody,
toot, toot!

653
00:30:41,383 --> 00:30:42,884
Toot, toot, to you!

654
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:45,303
[chugging] Whee!

655
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,060
[grunts]

656
00:30:54,104 --> 00:30:56,356
- Hello, John.
- Hello, Charlie.

657
00:30:57,274 --> 00:30:59,901
- Hey, Ava.
- Yeah, Sara?

658
00:30:59,985 --> 00:31:02,779
Are you bloody kidding me?
Puppets? Again?

659
00:31:02,863 --> 00:31:07,451
I wanted to say that I feel bad
that I made you feel bad.

660
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,412
Oh, well, maybe we should communicate.

661
00:31:10,495 --> 00:31:15,042
I'm sorry I kept the job offer
in Puppet Star City a secret.

662
00:31:15,125 --> 00:31:18,628
I was only considering it because I
thought you wanted to settle down.

663
00:31:18,712 --> 00:31:20,547
Well, I used to want that,

664
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:22,841
but I've been having
a lot of fun on the ship.

665
00:31:22,924 --> 00:31:23,884
Oh!

666
00:31:23,885 --> 00:31:27,137
Then I'll tell Puppet Wild Dog
to shove it!

667
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,764
- Yay!
- Yay!

668
00:31:28,889 --> 00:31:32,601
Maybe you can work out
your problem with communication.

669
00:31:32,684 --> 00:31:33,810
Yeah!

670
00:31:34,102 --> 00:31:36,563
You were gonna send me
to the South Pole, Charlie.

671
00:31:36,646 --> 00:31:39,191
You don't understand
how dangerous that Loom is, John-o.

672
00:31:39,566 --> 00:31:43,070
It gave my sisters and me control
over everyone's lives.

673
00:31:43,153 --> 00:31:45,322
I smashed that thing,
so we could be free.

674
00:31:45,405 --> 00:31:47,824
People could be free to rebel,
free to be weird.

675
00:31:47,908 --> 00:31:51,161
Come on, Charlie. If you sensed
that the Loom was in one universe again,

676
00:31:51,244 --> 00:31:53,663
what's to say
your sisters didn't feel it, too?

677
00:31:53,747 --> 00:31:56,458
What's to stop them going after it,
and for the wrong reasons?

678
00:31:57,334 --> 00:31:59,211
Listen, I will use
the Loom to help Astra,

679
00:31:59,294 --> 00:32:03,256
and then I will help you destroy it,
forever this time.

680
00:32:04,341 --> 00:32:05,550
Forever?

681
00:32:07,552 --> 00:32:08,720
Deal?

682
00:32:11,181 --> 00:32:12,182
Deal.

683
00:32:12,933 --> 00:32:16,561
Yay for communication and cooperation!

684
00:32:16,645 --> 00:32:17,813
Yay.

It's the Safe Space Sombrero.

693
00:32:32,452 --> 00:32:35,080
Please make it stop.
Make it just stop. I am going to just...

[growls]

698
00:32:46,466 --> 00:32:48,969
You've ruined her life.
Her life is absolutely in shambles

699
00:32:49,052 --> 00:32:51,263
because of you and the idiot brigade
she hangs out with.

700
00:32:51,346 --> 00:32:55,058
I mean, look at her. She is trapped
in this horrible fairy godmother job.

701
00:32:56,143 --> 00:32:57,477
- Horrible job?
- Mmm-hmm.

702
00:33:00,564 --> 00:33:01,940
You know what, Dad?

703
00:33:02,274 --> 00:33:03,567
My life now...

704
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:06,862
that's not Ray's choice, it's mine.

705
00:33:07,821 --> 00:33:09,781
I know you think
all magic should be self-serving,

706
00:33:09,865 --> 00:33:10,949
but I like helping kids

707
00:33:11,032 --> 00:33:13,660
because being raised by a demon cult
instead of my own father...

708
00:33:15,537 --> 00:33:17,080
that wasn't my choice.

709
00:33:18,248 --> 00:33:19,499
That was yours.

710
00:33:22,252 --> 00:33:25,005
So, maybe working with kids
helps me cope with that.

711
00:33:25,714 --> 00:33:27,007
And you're right.

712
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:29,301
I am not the Nora-doll you remember.

713
00:33:30,343 --> 00:33:31,845
I like who I am...

714
00:33:32,929 --> 00:33:34,389
and I'm never going back.

715
00:33:37,517 --> 00:33:38,977
I've been an ass.

716
00:33:40,729 --> 00:33:45,066
I've had this vision of this life
that would make you happy.

717
00:33:47,068 --> 00:33:48,528
Obviously, I was wrong.

718
00:33:49,446 --> 00:33:51,198
I just want you to be proud of me.

719
00:33:51,281 --> 00:33:52,282
Proud?

720
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,743

00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,703
I am.

Really?

00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:02,250
I really am.

No hard feelings, Ray.

[Nora] Yes.

- Yes.

Yes.

I can't wait to marry you.

So, let's... let's do it.

- Let's do it... Let's do it right now.
- Right now?

743
00:35:13,613 --> 00:35:15,490
Right now. I'm off-duty. My dad's here.

744
00:35:15,573 --> 00:35:17,367
His schedule's unpredictable.

745
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:20,996
So, let's... let's do it.
Right now. Tonight.

00:35:22,622 --> 00:35:23,999
Yeah. Okay.

I wanna tell you how much I appreciate
everything you've done for my daughter.

754
00:37:20,657 --> 00:37:24,619
Thank you, but, uh,
I haven't really done that much.

755
00:37:25,203 --> 00:37:28,832
She's pretty incredible all on her own.

756
00:37:28,915 --> 00:37:30,125
Yeah, but you make her happy.

757
00:37:31,876 --> 00:37:33,628
That's something
that I ultimately failed at

758
00:37:33,711 --> 00:37:35,422
when I was the main man in her life.

759
00:37:37,882 --> 00:37:40,510
Well, you know, I... I think
you're being too hard on yourself.

760
00:37:40,593 --> 00:37:41,803
I don't need a pep talk.

761
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:44,431
But I do need you
to do something for me.

762
00:37:46,433 --> 00:37:47,684
I need you to support her.

763
00:37:47,767 --> 00:37:49,310
Of course. Always.

764
00:37:49,394 --> 00:37:52,021
No, I don't think you understand
what I'm trying to say.

765
00:37:52,188 --> 00:37:54,566
Nora's job is very important to her...

766
00:37:55,442 --> 00:37:58,111
and she can't do it
on that silly little ship of yours.

767
00:37:59,154 --> 00:38:00,864
Nora belongs in the real world...

768
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:03,575
and you belong together.

769
00:38:05,034 --> 00:38:07,787
I hope you understand
what I'm trying to say here.

770
00:38:15,837 --> 00:38:19,007
Do the right thing, son,
or I'll come back and get you.

771
00:38:20,049 --> 00:38:23,678
- Ah, I'm only kidding.
- Okay. That's what I thought.

772
00:38:24,137 --> 00:38:25,180
But not really.

Eating your feelings, I see?

00:38:50,121 --> 00:38:52,207
She's better off without me.

776
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:54,292
She reached out to you for a reason.

777
00:38:59,214 --> 00:39:01,508
She's an idiot. I'm an idiot.

778
00:39:02,133 --> 00:39:04,469
She's a pain in the ass.
I'm a pain in the ass.

779
00:39:04,552 --> 00:39:06,846
The fact that she's not
already in juvie is a miracle,

780
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:09,516
- and it proves one thing.
- What?

781
00:39:10,016 --> 00:39:11,936
- I'm no good for her.
- Are you sure about that?

782
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,944
- You know what?
- Mmm?

783
00:39:21,027 --> 00:39:24,656
You've inspired me
to forego this evil thing.

784
00:39:24,739 --> 00:39:27,116
Maybe this old dog
can learn some new tricks.

785
00:39:27,825 --> 00:39:29,911
So, you'll stick around for a bit?

786
00:39:29,994 --> 00:39:33,331
Oh, I think it's time
both of us move on to the next chapter.

787
00:39:34,791 --> 00:39:37,335
Promise you'll check in on me
once in a while?

788
00:39:37,418 --> 00:39:38,461
Of course.

789
00:39:40,213 --> 00:39:41,589
I'll never be far.

790
00:39:48,888 --> 00:39:50,515
I love you, Nora-doll.

791
00:39:52,684 --> 00:39:54,060
I love you, Dad.

792
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:12,996
- Let's go.
- Okay.

793
00:40:18,042 --> 00:40:19,377
[cheers]

794
00:40:31,806 --> 00:40:33,266
Taking off already?

795
00:40:34,142 --> 00:40:36,644
Oh, I hate prolonged goodbyes.

796
00:40:36,769 --> 00:40:40,064
I'd rather slip out while everyone's
in there still having a good time.

797
00:40:40,148 --> 00:40:42,066
Mmm. So, where are you going?

under certain conditions.

00:40:46,154 --> 00:40:49,490
I was ordered to cause pain and misery,
and damn more souls to Hell.

800
00:40:49,574 --> 00:40:52,910
But instead, you decided
to check in on your Nora-doll.

801
00:40:55,246 --> 00:40:58,207
I just wanted to
make sure that my little girl's okay.

802
00:40:58,291 --> 00:40:59,751
And she is.

803
00:40:59,876 --> 00:41:01,669
Thanks to the help of you idiots.

804
00:41:02,295 --> 00:41:06,716
Plus, Astra's going to recall me soon
to an eternity of torture.

805
00:41:07,675 --> 00:41:10,635
I didn't want to bum my daughter out
with all of that on her wedding night.

806
00:41:19,729 --> 00:41:21,147
I know you'll never forgive me.

807
00:41:22,649 --> 00:41:23,816
To tell you the truth...

808
00:41:25,526 --> 00:41:26,526
I won't, either.

809
00:41:29,864 --> 00:41:30,865
