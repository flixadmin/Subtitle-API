My dogs are desperate
to meet you. <i>(CHUCKLES)</i>

163
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:29,138
I haven't fed them for seven days.
They're ravenous.

164
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,141
I wonder which parts they'll try first.

165
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,184
Your eyes?

166
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,061
Your balls?

167
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:39,982
We'll find out soon enough.

168
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:45,070
In the morning, then, bastard.

169
00:16:02,588 --> 00:16:06,383
JON: If he was smart, he'd stay inside
the walls of Winterfell and wait us out.

170
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:09,470
That's not his way.
He knows the North is watching.

171
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:12,389
If the other houses
sense weakness on his part,

172
00:16:12,473 --> 00:16:14,558
they'll stop fearing him.

173
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,060
He can't have that. Fear is his power.

174
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:18,437
It's his weakness, too.

175
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,999
His men don't want to fight for him.
They're forced to fight for him.

176
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:22,357
If they feel the tide turning...

177
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,651
It's not his men that worry me.

178
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:26,153
It's his horses.

179
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:28,739
I know what mounted knights can do to us.

180
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:31,658
You and Stannis cut through us
like piss through snow.

181
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:34,203
We're digging trenches all along our flanks.

182
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:36,347
They won't be able to hit us
the way that Stannis hit you,

183
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:37,581
in a double envelopment.

184
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:43,378
A pincer move.

185
00:16:48,926 --> 00:16:50,928
They won't be able to hit us from the sides.

186
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:52,763
Good.

187
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:58,393
It's crucial that we let them charge at us.

188
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,105
They've got the numbers,
we need the patience.

189
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,153
If we let him buckle our center,
he'll pursue.

190
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:10,829
Then we'll have him surrounded
on three sides.

191
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:15,494
Did you really think
that cunt would fight you man-to-man?

192
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,663
No.

193
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:20,082
But I wanted to make him angry.

194
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:25,087
I want him coming at us full tilt.

195
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:28,715
We should all get some sleep.

196
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:32,594
TORMUND: Rest, Jon Snow.
We need you sharp tomorrow.

197
00:17:43,272 --> 00:17:45,607
So, you've met the enemy,

198
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:47,484
drawn up your battle plans.

199
00:17:48,986 --> 00:17:51,613
Aye, for what they're worth.

200
00:17:52,573 --> 00:17:56,410
You've known him
for the space of a single conversation,

201
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:58,161
you and your trusted advisors,

202
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:02,624
and you sit around making your plans
on how to defeat a man you don't know.

203
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,418
I lived with him.

204
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:08,088
I know the way his mind works.
I know how he likes to hurt people.

205
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:13,510
Did it ever once occur to you
that I might have some insight?

206
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:17,222
You're right.

207
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:22,936
You think he's going to fall into your trap.
He won't. He's the one who lays traps.

208
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,023
- He's overconfident.
- He plays with people.

209
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:28,609
He's far better at it than you.
He's been doing it all his life.

210
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:31,862
Aye, and what have I been doing all my life?
Playing with broomsticks?

211
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:35,407
I fought beyond the Wall
against worse than Ramsay Bolton.

212
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,160
I've defended the Wall
from worse than Ramsay Bolton.

213
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:40,704
You don't know him.

214
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:43,582
All right, tell me.

215
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:46,877
What should we do?
How do we get Rickon back?

216
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:50,631
We'll never get him back.

217
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:55,218
Rickon is Ned Stark's trueborn son,

218
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:59,222
which makes him a greater threat to Ramsay
than you, a bastard, or me, a girl.

219
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:03,226
As long as he lives, Ramsay's claim
to Winterfell will be contested,

220
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:06,813
which means he won't live long.

221
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:09,274
We can't give up on our brother.

222
00:19:09,358 --> 00:19:12,444
Listen to me, please.
He wants you to make a mistake.

223
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:13,528
Of course he does.

224
00:19:14,237 --> 00:19:15,656
What should I do differently?

225
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:18,241
I don't know.
I don't know anything about battles.

226
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:21,244
Just don't do what he wants you to do.

227
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:22,704
Aye, that's good advice.

228
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:25,582
- You think that's obvious?
- Well, it is a bit obvious.

229
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:26,934
If you had asked for my advice earlier,

230
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,686
I would have told you not
to attack Winterfell

231
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,921
until we had a larger force,
or is that obvious, too?

232
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:33,465
When will we have a larger force?

233
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:35,550
We've pleaded with every house
that'll have us.

234
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:38,929
The Blackfish can't help us.
We're lucky to have this many men.

235
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:42,432
- It's not enough.
- No, it's not enough. It's what we have.

236
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:50,649
Battles have been won against greater odds.

237
00:19:57,406 --> 00:20:00,617
If Ramsay wins,
I'm not going back there alive.

238
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:02,953
Do you understand me?

239
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:09,209
I won't ever let him touch you again.

240
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:14,548
I'll protect you, I promise.

241
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:17,759
No one can protect me.

242
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:20,095
No one can protect anyone.

DAVOS: You think there's hope?

245
00:20:41,158 --> 00:20:43,744
TORMUND: I've never seen
these Bolton fuckers fight.

246
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:47,748
And they've never seen the free folk fight,
so, yes, there's hope.

You want to avenge your king, don't you?

It wasn't the Boltons defeated Stannis.
It was Stannis himself.

249
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:02,929
I loved the man.
He lifted me up and made me something.

250
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:06,558
But he had demons in his skull
whispering foul things.

251
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:08,769
- You saw these demons?
- What?

252
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:12,856
No, it's a manner of speaking.

253
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:16,818
Not actual demons.

254
00:21:17,903 --> 00:21:18,904
Oh.

255
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:24,367
Well, you loved that cunt Stannis
and I loved the man he burned.

256
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:26,661
Mance didn't have demons in his skull.

257
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:29,915
He didn't torch people
or listen to some red witch.

258
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,584
I believed in him.

259
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:36,588
I thought he was the man
to lead us through the Long Night.

260
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:38,840
But I was wrong, just like you.

261
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:44,137
Maybe that was our mistake,
believing in kings.

262
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:47,974
Jon Snow's not a king.

263
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:51,603
No, he's not.

264
00:21:54,898 --> 00:21:58,735
I need a good drink
to help me sleep the night before a fight.

265
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:00,403
You want some?

266
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:02,781
I have a jug of sour goat's milk

267
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:07,077
stronger than any of that grape water
you southern twats like sucking on.

268
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:11,081
No, thanks. It does sound delicious,
but I better keep a clear head.

269
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:14,084
I can never sleep the night before a battle.

270
00:22:14,793 --> 00:22:15,961
So what do you do all night?

271
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:19,089
I walk. Think and walk.

272
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:22,509
Think and walk
until I'm far enough away from camp

273
00:22:22,592 --> 00:22:24,511
that no one can hear me

Don't lose.

I'm ordering you not to bring me back.

I am not your servant, Jon Snow.

286

You're in my camp. I'm the commander.

287
00:23:20,525 --> 00:23:22,235
I serve the Lord of Light.

I do what he commands.

How do you know what he commands?

290
00:23:28,533 --> 00:23:30,744
I interpret his signs

291
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:33,997
as well as I can.

292
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:40,545

Only what he gives me, and he gave me you.

Why?

I don't know.

297
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:02,025
Maybe you're only needed for
this small part of his plan and nothing else.

298
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,654
Maybe he brought you here to die again.

I seem to recall.

Everyone who makes a joke

And he paid for them.

318
00:26:53,238 --> 00:26:54,572
Doesn't seem like it.

319
00:26:55,365 --> 00:26:56,366
He's still alive.

320
00:26:57,367 --> 00:27:00,745
It was complicated for you, I'm sure,
growing up at Winterfell.

321
00:27:02,122 --> 00:27:03,832
Never quite knowing who you were.

322
00:27:04,874 --> 00:27:07,961
But then, we all live
complicated lives, don't we?

323
00:27:08,586 --> 00:27:12,173
You've brought us 100 ships
from the Iron Fleet with men to sail them.

324
00:27:12,215 --> 00:27:17,053
In return, I expect you want me to support
your claim to the throne of the Iron Islands?

325
00:27:17,137 --> 00:27:18,972
Not my claim. Hers.

326
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:21,141
And what's wrong with you?

327
00:27:21,224 --> 00:27:22,725
I'm not fit to rule.

328
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:24,561
We can agree upon that at least.

329
00:27:24,602 --> 00:27:26,521
Has the Iron Islands ever had
a queen before?

330
00:27:27,188 --> 00:27:28,690
No more than Westeros.

331
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:34,195
Our Uncle Euron returned home
after a long absence.

332
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:37,407
He murdered our father
and took the Salt Throne from Yara.

333
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:40,493
He would have murdered us if we'd stayed.

334
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:44,622
Lord Tyrion tells me
your father was a terrible king.

335
00:27:44,706 --> 00:27:46,749
You and I have that in common.

336
00:27:48,668 --> 00:27:52,046
We do.
And both murdered by a usurper as well.

337
00:27:53,298 --> 00:27:54,424
Will their ships be enough?

338
00:27:55,258 --> 00:27:58,303
With the former Masters' fleet, possibly.

339
00:27:58,386 --> 00:27:59,429
Barely.

340
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:03,266
There are more than 100 ships
in the Iron Fleet.

341
00:28:03,308 --> 00:28:05,685
There are, and Euron is building more.

342
00:28:05,768 --> 00:28:07,437
He's going to offer them to you.

343
00:28:07,478 --> 00:28:08,897
So why shouldn't I wait for him?

344
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:11,399
The Iron Fleet isn't all he's bringing.

345
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:13,693
He also wants to give you...

346
00:28:13,776 --> 00:28:16,738
His big cock, I think he said.

347
00:28:18,114 --> 00:28:20,950
Euron's offer is also
an offer of marriage, you see.

348
00:28:20,992 --> 00:28:22,785
You won't get one without the other.

349
00:28:22,869 --> 00:28:25,455
And I imagine your offer
is free of any marriage demands?

350
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:28,583
I never demand,
but I'm up for anything, really.

351
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:33,546
He murdered our father
and would have murdered us.

352
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:35,882
He'll murder you
as soon as you have what he wants.

353
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:37,592
The Seven Kingdoms.

354
00:28:37,634 --> 00:28:38,843
All of them.

355
00:28:38,927 --> 00:28:40,803
And you don't want the Seven Kingdoms?

356
00:28:40,887 --> 00:28:43,640
Your ancestors defeated ours
and took the Iron Islands.

357
00:28:44,974 --> 00:28:46,559
We ask you to give them back.

358
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,061
And that's all?

359
00:28:48,144 --> 00:28:50,772
We'd like you to help us
murder an uncle or two

360
00:28:50,813 --> 00:28:52,649
who don't think a woman's fit to rule.

361
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:54,108
Reasonable.

362
00:28:56,986 --> 00:28:59,239
What if everyone starts demanding
their independence?

363
00:28:59,322 --> 00:29:01,324
She's not demanding, she's asking.

364
00:29:01,991 --> 00:29:04,327
The others are free to ask as well.

365
00:29:08,164 --> 00:29:11,125
Our fathers were evil men, all of us here.

366
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:13,634
They left the world worse
than they found it.

367

We're not going to do that.

368

We're going to leave the world
better than we found it.

369
00:29:21,344 --> 00:29:24,514
You will support my claim
as queen of the Seven Kingdoms

370

and respect the integrity
of the Seven Kingdoms.

371
