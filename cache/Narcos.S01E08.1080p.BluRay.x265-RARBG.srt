to having trafficked drugs one time.

And worst of all,
he wants to build his own jail

00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:48,018
We are going to fight, do whatever we have
to do, and we are going to finish him.

157
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,687
We have options.

158
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:54,650
For instance, why don't we allow
the American military to come in?

159
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:58,570
I know... we don't like it.
I personally don't like it.

160
00:12:58,654 --> 00:13:01,448
But if it's a specific, clear mission...

161
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:02,741
- No. — something covert.

162
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:10,749
It's time to end all of this.

163
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:17,464
Give Escobar what he wants.

164
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:22,219
[Eduardo] Let's go.

165
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:38,145
[Javier in English] If your congress
abolishes extradition, we lose our teeth.

166
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:40,946
- We're a paper fucking tiger!
- Everything we have done is lost.

167
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,739
[Eduardo] We have no choice.

168
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:46,743
The people, the public... it's tired
of all these bombs and bloodshed!

169
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:48,370
Right, and business goes as usual,

170
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,706
- he just runs it from thatjail.
- Exactly!

171
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:54,418
All things considered,
it's a victory to put Escobar in jail.

172
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:57,212
For public relations?

173
00:13:57,421 --> 00:13:59,047
It's capitulation.

174
00:14:00,132 --> 00:14:02,300
You want Escobar.

175
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:04,136
Why?

176
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:07,055
Why?

177
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:12,144
Because you want to parade him
in your DEA jackets?

178
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:14,229
You think this is a game, right?

179
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:17,649
This is Colombia,
and our people want peace!

180
00:14:17,733 --> 00:14:19,901
This is not a fucking game!

181
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:31,246
[In Spanish] Well...
At this time, our friend, Fernando,

182
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:34,082
is going to tell us a little something.

183
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,209
[Clears throat]

184
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:40,338
The Colombian government is going
to allow Pablo to turn himself in,

185
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:46,386
accepting only one simple charge:
Drug trafficking.

186
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,597
And...

187
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,974
They are going to let him build a jail

188
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:57,022
which the police
cannot be within three kilometers of.

189
00:14:57,105 --> 00:15:00,525
At last...
We have liberated ourselves from tyranny!

190
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:03,945
- Long live Colombia, motherfuckers.
- Iviva!

191
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,615
- Fernando...
- Mm?

192
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:10,786
- Thank you very much.
- No problem, Pablo.

193
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:15,624
And do you know when congress
is going to vote to abolish extradition?

194
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:20,712
Mm! Yes, it's...
It's a matter of... of weeks.

195
00:15:20,796 --> 00:15:24,591
And at that time, you will be able
to turn yourself over to the authorities.

196
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:28,178
It pleases me very much to finish my work
with you with such a great victory.

197
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:32,432
No, brother. Now is when I am
going to need your services the most.

198
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:39,189
- How... how's that?
- Fernando...

199
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:46,863
Now it's time for us to find legal means
to reduce my sentence even more.

200
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:52,369
Right?

201
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:53,870
[Chuckles]

202
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:57,249
[Sighs]

203
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:16,560
And what does this mean for us, huh?

204
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:22,732
It means, my love...
That now I have a jail.

205
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:29,823
And for you,
visiting days will be...

206
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:33,535
- Every day.
- [Laughs]

207
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:36,204
- I'm serious, Pablo. — so am I.

208
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:41,293
[Sighs]
The problem, Pablo, is that...

209
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:44,796
Now that you have admitted
to trafficking in narcotics,

210
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,425
my image as a journalist
cannot be associated with yours.

211
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:52,971
[Pablo] Hm.

212
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:56,641
So then...

213
00:16:59,311 --> 00:17:06,026
Now you think I am going to damage your
credibility as a journalist... is that it?

214
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:10,280
You understand what I'm saying.

215
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:13,325
Oh, yeah, sure. Of course I do.

216
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:20,957
I think that... it's time for me

217
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:27,005
to set you free, so that...
You can find a boyfriend who's honest...

218
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:33,345
So that you can get a little house,
have little kids,

219
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:35,764
- little dogs...
- Don't joke around, Pablo.

220
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:37,807
No, I'm not joking.

221
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:42,687
[Softly] I just want you to know...

222
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,191
That you, Valeria...

223
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:50,737
Are a bandit, just like me.

224
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:58,036
So don't come to me with bullshit.

225
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:16,888
Looks like you got away with it,
eh, asshole?

226
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:27,691
Shit, I'd thought you'd gone crazy.

227
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:40,120
Geniuses...
Are always branded as crazy.

228
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:43,039
- Am I right? — yeah.

229
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,131
- The ochoas...
- The ochoas what?

230
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:55,135
You can bet
they're going to be pissed off.

231
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:57,095
Because of the treaty?

232
00:18:58,221 --> 00:19:01,141
Or because you're fucking their sister?

233
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,656
That was a stupid mistake, Gustavo.

234
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:25,874
Let's hope they don't
charge you for it later.

235
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,209
[Steve] The race was on.

236
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:31,921
Pablo needed to build his jail
as fast as possible.

237
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:36,217
As for his enemies, they needed
to get to him before that happened.

238
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:39,888
As soon as he walked inside,
Pablo would be safe.

239
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:42,599
And everyone on the outside wouldn't.

240
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:46,853
[In English] We got an official cease
and desist order for any further operation

241
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:49,189
when Pablo officially surrenders.

242
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:52,835
- Search bloc is gonna be disbanded.
- [Javier] We heard the terms.

243
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:56,196
- No cops within two miles of the prison.
- This is a fucking sham.

244
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:58,573
It's a death warrant for my men.

245
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:01,910
I won't be able to protect them.

246
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:05,580
I won't let that happen.

247
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,170
There are cops that hate Escobar
just as much as I do.

248
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:14,714
More.

249
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:19,052
They're not gonna stop
just because they're told to.

250
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:22,430
You talking about vigilantes?

251
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:27,435
Call it what you like... but I'm still
gonna need those intel reports.

252
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,414
- We'll get you anything we find.
- Javi, you gotta cool it with that shit.

253
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:33,108
They know we've been helping.
One more and we're out.

254
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:34,984
I thought you said you were all in.

255
00:20:36,111 --> 00:20:38,446
[In Spanish]
The soccer field will be over here.

256
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:44,661
Here, I want to have
a little doll house for manuela,

257
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:50,166
and downstairs,
a bar with a jacuzzi for the guys.

258
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,794
My family will live in a house
down the hill.

259
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:57,048
I'm going to install a telescope
so I can look at them whenever I want.

260
00:20:57,257 --> 00:21:00,093
Yeah, right. More like
you can look at other girls' asses.

261
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:05,056
No. The family, the family.
To see my kids.

262
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:10,353
- What can we do to help you, Pablo?
- Well...

263
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:13,565
While we're in prison,
Gustavo and me,

264
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:19,487
I will count on you, moncada, and you,
galeano, to oversee operations.

265
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:22,824
Thank you, Pablo.

266
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:28,079
We're privileged to be given
that responsibility. You can count on us.

267
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:31,875
We've already spoken about the operational
plan and everything's clear, right?

268
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,085
Yes. We won't let you down, Pablo.

269
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:36,421
Did you tell them about the tax?

270
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,883
- No, I didn't.
- The tax?

271
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:41,926
What tax is this?

272
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:46,431
Who paid for the war we fought?

273
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:53,146
- You, Don Pablo.
- That's right.

274
00:21:54,564 --> 00:21:57,066
We have peace now.

275
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:00,820
You're going to directly
benefit from that.

276
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:07,202
It's only fair that you contribute
to the legal and security costs

277
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:10,038
that Gustavo and I will face behind bars.

278
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:13,750
And about how much will that be?

279
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:18,463
We agreed to what,
$200,000 a month, right?

280
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,715
Yes, 200 grand.

281
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:23,051
200 grand?

282
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:27,055
That's a lot of money, brother.
A lot of money.

283
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:29,015
But consider it done.

284
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:33,394
And again... thank you
very much for this responsibility,

285
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:35,980
- and for considering us.
- All right, then.

286
00:22:36,231 --> 00:22:39,817
- Don Pablo. All right. Gustavo.
- [Indistinct chatter in Spanish]

287
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:51,496
Do you think that was a smart move, Pablo?

288
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:55,458
Why should I let them
reap the fruits of our labor

289
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:58,378
without compensating us for it, Gustavo?

290
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,131
I agree with you.

291
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:07,554
But right now, we really
need those two fags to be loyal.

292
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:10,807
And what?
You don't think I inspire loyalty?

293
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:14,269
My loyalty?
Yes, you know you have it.

294
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:16,479
But I'm not sure about everyone else's.

295
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:21,192
You know, the thing is, Pablo...
You won.

296
00:23:21,276 --> 00:23:23,570
There's no arguing that.

297
00:23:23,653 --> 00:23:25,488
But you gave in.

298
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:29,158
And there are people
who will see that as weakness.

299
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:34,163
We've gotta keep our enemies close,
now more than ever.

300
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,128
- [Waiter murmurs in Spanish]
- [Valeria] Thank you.

301
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:45,133
It's great to see you again, Valeria.

302
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:49,804
Likewise, pacho.
I'm very happy to see you.

303
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:54,267
Although, I must say...
It was a little unexpected.

304
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:57,895
We are worried about you.

305
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:02,066
And... why are "we" worried?

306
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:05,486
Pablo's cutting a deal
with the government.

307
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,530
He's going to have
to admit to certain things.

308
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:11,993
Things that may damage
your reputation by association.

309
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:19,751
If I'm good at anything,
it's protecting my reputation.

310
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,920
Listen, this time it's different.

311
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:29,385
Look... you helped create
that "Robin hood paisa" bullshit.

312
00:24:29,594 --> 00:24:34,057
And when it all goes to shit, you'll have
to take responsibility for that.

313
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:37,018
Maybe he tricked me, too.
Like the rest of the world.

314
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:39,187
You have enemies, see?

315
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,147
They're not gonna
let you get away with it.

316
00:24:42,357 --> 00:24:44,359
Look, Valeria...

317
00:24:44,442 --> 00:24:50,031
We have a lot of connections in New York,
a strong presence, you could say.

318
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:53,326
You should go there,
at least for a little while.

319
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:54,786
And leave Colombia.

320
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:58,039
There are a million Colombians there.

321
00:24:58,122 --> 00:25:00,875
A new audience.

322
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:04,003
And they don't care if you shared your bed
with a monster or not.

323
00:25:07,715 --> 00:25:10,218
- [Sighs] — just for a while.

324
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:13,501
When this is all over, you'll be able to
come back here with your head held high,

325
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:15,556
I guarantee it.

326
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:21,562
And not only that, you'll have earned
a brand-new audience in the United States.

327
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:27,527
- Betrayal is not my style.
- What betrayal?

328
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:30,363
And what would you be betraying?

329
00:25:31,698 --> 00:25:33,658
Your role as his mistress?

330
00:25:34,617 --> 00:25:40,832
You remain loyal to a man who has never
thought you're good enough to be his wife.

331
00:25:43,668 --> 00:25:46,337
No, no, no,
you're very much mistaken, my dear.

332
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:48,381
The last thing I want
is to be married to him.

333
00:25:49,507 --> 00:25:52,677
Besides...
Do you think I'd want to be his wife?

334
00:25:55,263 --> 00:25:59,183
Do you think I want to be locked up,
waiting all day at the Monaco building,

335
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:01,060
while he's out with...

336
00:26:03,271 --> 00:26:04,731
With me?

337
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:10,987
That's too boring.

- [Tata moans]
- [Pablo grunting]

I missed you, too.

No, it was terrible.

It was terrible.

344
00:26:39,474 --> 00:26:42,185
Every day in a different house...

345
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:46,022
Worried about you...

[Sighs]

347
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,491
The truth is...

348
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:01,996
It's very good to be home.

349
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:06,626
- You look happy.
- Of course.

350

[Soft chuckle]

351
00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:11,923
That time has passed.

352
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:17,553
It's the happiest face I've ever seen
on a man about to go to jail.

Come on.

[Steve] The explosion was
from a car bomb on the street below,

370
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:11,941
about 800 pounds' worth of dynamite.

371
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:14,819
It made little manuela
forever deaf in one ear.

the innocent always seemed
to be the ones who got hurt.

374
00:28:22,785 --> 00:28:26,330
For Escobar, the Monaco bombing
told him two things:

375
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:31,752
First, it showed him that the cops
weren't his biggest problem.

376
00:28:33,254 --> 00:28:35,047
They would never use a bomb.

377
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:40,720
This was a new player, one that
wasn't above going after his family.

378
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:43,639
[In Spanish] Don't worry, cousin.

We're going to kill them all.

[Steve] Second, and the one
that fucked with his head the most...

381
00:28:55,776 --> 00:29:01,991
Was that for the first time in his life...
Someone had given him up.

382
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:07,246
And worse yet,
he had no idea who.

[In Spanish] Hello?

385
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:20,384
[Man] Valeria, there was an attempted hit
at the Monaco building.

00:29:20,468 --> 00:29:25,306
- Just now?
- Yes, a few minutes ago. A car bomb.

00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:28,726
- Who was inside?
- We don't know.

[Stammers]
What other information do you have?

That's all the information
we have right now.

Ok, thanks.

You know what he's going to do, right?

402
00:30:42,425 --> 00:30:44,945
He's going to continue conducting
his business behind those walls

403
00:30:44,969 --> 00:30:48,472
that are protected
by the Colombian government.

404
00:30:48,556 --> 00:30:51,434
We should give him credit.
The man is a genius.

405
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:55,563
Well... all the more reason
that we should negotiate our surrender.

406
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:59,108
But you know that Pablo
took it upon himself to close that door.

407
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:01,378
So we need to take advantage
of your political contacts,

408
00:31:01,402 --> 00:31:03,988
especially general jaramillo.

409

Can you talk to him for us?

410
00:31:06,741 --> 00:31:09,160
Yes, of course.

00:31:09,243 --> 00:31:11,829
But I don't think it will be enough.

[Jorge] What are you saying?

413
00:31:13,289 --> 00:31:16,459
That you're going
to have to offer something more,

414
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:20,296
something that interests them enough
to make a deal with you.

If that son of a bitch goes down,
the whole empire goes down.

[Steve] It is often said
there is no honor among thieves.

That's doubly true of drug dealers.

The ochoas, with the help of Cali,
made their own surrender deal.

No extradition, no stiff sentence.

was willing to overlook their part

in the largest cocaine empire
on the face of the earth.

'cause all they had to do
was use their sister as bait

You're making a big mistake, carrillo.

We're already in negotiations
with the government.

I won't do that myself.

But I want to introduce you to some people
who would love to do it for me.

This guy? This is lastia.

His sister died in a bookstore in Bogota
in a bombing you coordinated.

She was 17 years old.

This is trujillo.

461
00:35:11,777 --> 00:35:16,323
You killed his father
and his brother for being cops.

462
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:21,370
- That has nothing to do with me.
- No?

You know...
If you support evil, you are evil.

464

Look at them.

465
00:35:31,547 --> 00:35:33,924
I just want you to look at their faces.

466
00:35:34,133 --> 00:35:37,261
A few of the victims
you've left in your wake.

467
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:40,014
Tell me...

468
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:45,477
Have you ever felt
the swift vengeance of justice?

469
00:35:49,857 --> 00:35:52,234
Give me your cousin...

470
00:35:52,318 --> 00:35:55,988
Or I'll let these men
show you that vengeance with their fists.

471
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:13,422
Do it, then...
You sons of bitches.

472
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,215
Ok, then.

473
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:22,848
We'll see how you feel...
After ten minutes.

474
00:36:24,141 --> 00:36:25,517
Do it.

475
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:29,229
[Grunts]

- [Gustavo grunts, groans]

[Wheezing]

479
00:36:51,794 --> 00:36:54,254
Tell me where your cousin is.

480
00:36:55,172 --> 00:36:57,841
It doesn't have to end like this.

481

[Sputters]

482

[Coughing]

483
00:37:17,903 --> 00:37:20,114
Tell me where your cousin is.

[Panting]

485
00:37:28,831 --> 00:37:33,919
Are bandits...
Not snitches, motherfucker.

[Gustavo laughs]

487
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:55,107
[Shouts] You're...
You're all gonna die, motherfuckers!

488
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,985
You're all dead, motherfuckers!

489
00:37:58,068 --> 00:38:00,696
You're all dead, motherfuckers!

490
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:06,743
You, your families,
your wives are all dead, motherfuckers!

491
00:38:06,827 --> 00:38:08,036
You're all dead!

492
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:15,043
Dump his body on the road to sabaneta.

493
00:38:15,127 --> 00:38:17,754
Colonel, they're going
to make us pay for this.

494
00:38:19,173 --> 00:38:24,011
Report his death as a result
of a shoot-out with the police.

495
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:26,763
Make sure you report that he fired first.

496
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:28,932
But colonel, he's all beat up.

497
00:38:35,731 --> 00:38:37,608
That work for you?

498
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:55,584
There is nothing... more beautiful
and more important in my life than this.

499
00:38:57,044 --> 00:39:00,756
We're all here together... united.

500
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:07,471
Now let's eat and enjoy
this marvelous food.

501
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:13,393
- Wait, wait.
- Oh, yeah, the beets.

502
00:39:13,602 --> 00:39:15,854
- Tata?
- Boss?

503
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:20,192
Hello, son. Have a seat.

504
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:23,237
- Sit down...
- Boss, I don't know how to say this.

505
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:27,574
Tell me like a man.

506
00:39:28,742 --> 00:39:30,744
- Gustavo is dead.
- What?

507
00:39:34,623 --> 00:39:37,417
They found his body on the outskirts
of sabaneta, badly beaten.

508
00:39:37,501 --> 00:39:39,419
[Hermilda] How's that?

509
00:39:39,628 --> 00:39:41,046
They also shot him, boss.

510
00:39:41,255 --> 00:39:44,258
No, no!
How dare you come to my house saying that!

511
00:39:44,466 --> 00:39:47,469
How dare you!
Leave! Get out of my house!

512
00:39:47,553 --> 00:39:51,265
You... you are leaving right now!
Get out of my house! Go on!

513
00:39:51,348 --> 00:39:54,935
No! Gustavo, no. Pablo...
Go on! Get out of here!

514
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:59,314
[Whispers] It's ok.
Everything's going to be fine.

[Sobbing]

516
00:40:09,825 --> 00:40:11,827
Are you sure about this?

517
00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:13,912
[Softly] Yes, boss.

518
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:20,961
I want you to take him
to the funeral home...

519
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:26,133
And guard his body the entire time
until it's buried.

520
00:40:27,259 --> 00:40:28,927
- All right.
- Go on.

521
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:38,395
[Door opens]

522
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:42,316
How are you doing, son?

523
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:21,897
I'm going to miss him so much, mama.

524
00:41:30,739 --> 00:41:37,746
You were nine... or ten...
Do you remember?

525
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:41,958
How you would
ride around on your bicycles.

526
00:41:42,876 --> 00:41:44,461
[Chuckles]

527
00:41:45,587 --> 00:41:49,174
You'd go up into the mountains
and just disappear.

528
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:53,095
The whole day would go by...

529
00:41:55,347 --> 00:41:56,848
Oh, my.

530
00:41:57,766 --> 00:41:59,935
And we would call you...

531
00:42:01,186 --> 00:42:06,066
We seemed crazy,
yelling for you all over the place...

532
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:11,738
Until finally you would appear.

533
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:15,158
Oh, my god.

534
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:18,370
"Where were you?"

535
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:22,666
"Where have you been, son?"
I would yell out.

536
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:26,753
"In the mountains, mama."

537
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:34,344
"Higher than the clouds, auntie,"
Gustavo would say, laughing.

538
00:42:43,186 --> 00:42:45,772
He always wanted to go farther.

539
00:42:48,817 --> 00:42:51,153
He always did.

540
00:42:51,236 --> 00:42:53,655
- But with you.
- [Sighs]

541
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:56,700
Only with you.

542
00:43:01,621 --> 00:43:04,458
I didn't think it would end this way.

543
00:43:05,584 --> 00:43:07,586
[Breath trembling]

544
00:43:38,742 --> 00:43:40,577
Good afternoon.

545
00:43:40,786 --> 00:43:43,455
[Low murmurs]

546
00:43:43,538 --> 00:43:48,335
Boss? Someone came
all the way out here to see you.

547
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:53,673
Miss Valeria.

548
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:10,148
Good day, ma'am. Pablo.

549
00:44:11,024 --> 00:44:12,526
What's she doing here?

550
00:44:12,609 --> 00:44:15,529
I'm here only because
I have important information.

551
00:44:15,612 --> 00:44:17,072
I hope it's very important.

552
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,741
It's about Gustavo.

553
00:44:21,076 --> 00:44:22,702
Tell us, then.

554
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:27,457
I've been told the ochoa brothers
have been seen in Cali.

555
00:44:27,541 --> 00:44:30,710
They are the ones
who turned Gustavo over,

556
00:44:30,794 --> 00:44:34,464
in exchange for the cartel helping them
seal a deal with the government.

557
00:44:34,548 --> 00:44:35,882
How do you know that?

558
00:44:36,091 --> 00:44:38,552
You know me, Pablo.

559
00:44:39,553 --> 00:44:41,304
I have my ways.

560
00:44:50,313 --> 00:44:52,649
Who in Cali?

561
00:44:55,318 --> 00:44:56,570
Pacho herrera.

562
00:44:59,364 --> 00:45:02,158
[Steve]
Pablo wanted to send a message to Cali,

563
00:45:02,242 --> 00:45:06,413
so he ordered his sicarios
to hit them during a soccer match.

564
00:45:06,496 --> 00:45:09,833
- It was very effective.
- [Overlapping gunfire]

565
00:45:13,712 --> 00:45:16,423
He did get 14 Cali men that day.

566
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:20,719
The problem was, everyone on
the soccer field was dressed the same.

567
00:45:23,555 --> 00:45:24,681
[Men grunting]

568
00:45:27,976 --> 00:45:30,687
- [Gun clicking]
- By the time the sicarios spotted pacho,

569
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:32,522
he was already running away.

570
00:45:33,607 --> 00:45:36,443
[Somber Latin song playing]

571
00:45:36,526 --> 00:45:38,987
[Priest in Spanish]
"Will you hide yourself forever, lord?

572
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:43,074
Will your wrath burn like fire?

573
00:45:43,158 --> 00:45:46,202
Remember how fleeting is my life,

574
00:45:46,286 --> 00:45:50,665
for what futility
you have created the children of men."

575
00:45:50,749 --> 00:45:53,960
[Steve] Pablo had Gustavo
buried in the hills of medellin,

576
00:45:54,044 --> 00:45:56,254
- where the cousins had played as kids.
- [Sniffling]

577
00:45:56,338 --> 00:45:57,964
In his mind,
losing his best friend

578
00:45:58,048 --> 00:46:01,551
was a price he had to pay
to defeat extradition.

579
00:46:01,635 --> 00:46:05,138
So he ordered the burial
to take place at the exact same time

580
00:46:05,347 --> 00:46:08,433
- that congress was voting to repeal it.
- [Inaudible dialogue]

581
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:12,979
Whether it was gaviria's support,
Pablo's "plata or plomo,"

582
00:46:13,063 --> 00:46:15,649
or maybe people
were just sick of the violence...

583
00:46:15,857 --> 00:46:19,069
Extradition was defeated by a landslide.

584
00:46:20,028 --> 00:46:22,614
Hours after the vote,
a military helicopter

585
00:46:22,697 --> 00:46:25,742
was dispatched to coordinates
just outside medellin,

586
00:46:25,825 --> 00:46:28,036
where Pablo was waiting.

587
00:46:39,506 --> 00:46:42,425
[Eduardo in Spanish] As you know,
I come on behalf of president gaviria

588
00:46:42,509 --> 00:46:43,677
and the Colombian government.

589
00:46:43,885 --> 00:46:48,390
This is the offer of our terms
for your surrender.

590
00:46:48,598 --> 00:46:51,726
[Steve] Pefia and I
had to go see it with our own eyes.

591
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:56,064
A terrorist, a drug dealer and a murderer
surrendering to a grateful nation

592
00:46:56,147 --> 00:46:59,109
who gave him everything he asked for.

593
00:46:59,192 --> 00:47:03,321
It was the closest we 'd ever come to him,
and we never felt further away.

594
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,199
[Pablo in Spanish] All right, then.

595
00:47:08,702 --> 00:47:10,495
Let me hand over my gun.

596
00:47:14,416 --> 00:47:17,544
- You won.
- We both did.

597
00:47:19,045 --> 00:47:22,007
Now gaviria can announce
that Pablo Escobar has turned himself in.

598
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:26,386
Except that's not so true.

599
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:28,722
You and I know it's a big lie.

600
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:38,648
Lies are necessary... when the truth
is too difficult to believe. Right?

601
00:47:42,027 --> 00:47:44,320
[Steve]
It wasn't a fucking surrender.

602
00:47:44,529 --> 00:47:47,323
Pablo wasn't succumbing to justice.

603
00:47:47,532 --> 00:47:53,038
He was escaping it.
And all anyone could do was watch.

604
00:47:58,877 --> 00:48:03,173
Once again, Escobar had used violence
to bend the world to his will.

605
00:48:04,132 --> 00:48:08,386
They called it "la gran mentira,"
"the big lie."

606
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:10,680
And it was a lie.

607
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:16,311
Except as I watched him
fly away to his luxury prison...

608
00:48:17,896 --> 00:48:19,981
I couldn't help but think
there was some truth in it.

609
00:48:20,065 --> 00:48:22,442
[Steve mutters] Damn it. Fucker.

610
00:48:22,525 --> 00:48:25,320
A truth that I hadn't
been willing to accept.

611
00:48:29,074 --> 00:48:32,619
He'd beat us because
he was willing to do what we weren't.

612
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:36,039
Bad guys don't play by the rules.

613
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:38,666
That's what makes 'em bad.

614
00:48:39,918 --> 00:48:42,128
Maybe that's what lets 'em win.

615
00:48:42,212 --> 00:48:44,964
[Poison in Spanish] Lagarto,
are we gonna party tonight or what?

616
00:48:45,048 --> 00:48:48,551
[In English] I got poison at 400
to 1700 megahertz, gentlemen.

617
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,720
La dispensaria.

618
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:54,057
So who do we give this to? DEA?

619
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:57,560
- Yeah. Let's give it to Javier pena.
- Pefia's an asshole.

620
00:48:57,644 --> 00:48:59,521
- I'm gonna give it to the other guy.
- Sure.

621
00:49:00,313 --> 00:49:03,483
[Steve] I made a promise to myself
that when the time came

00:49:03,566 --> 00:49:05,819
that I could strike a blow
against Escobar,

623
00:49:05,902 --> 00:49:08,988
even if it meant breaking the rules,
oh, I was gonna do it.

624
00:49:09,072 --> 00:49:12,158
- Hello?
- [Man] Hey, central spike here.

625
00:49:12,367 --> 00:49:13,952
[Carrillo in Spanish] All right.

626

[Up—tempo Latin music playing]

627
00:49:19,124 --> 00:49:22,210
[Steve] You wanna tell me a good guy
wouldn't have pushed the buttons

628
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:23,920
on these mothen'uckers?

629
00:49:25,755 --> 00:49:27,966
You wanna call me a bad guy?

630
00:49:28,049 --> 00:49:31,302
- [Overlapping gunfire]
- [Screaming]

631
00:49:35,306 --> 00:49:39,769
Fine. But if you do, it just means
that you haven't met enough bad guys yet

632
00:49:39,853 --> 00:49:41,020
to know the difference.

633
00:49:42,564 --> 00:49:45,400
There's one thing I've learned
down here in Colombia,

634
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:48,820
- good and bad are relative concepts.

00:49:48,903 --> 00:49:51,948
J“ yesterday, I fought the devil
who they say is very brave j“

636
00:49:52,031 --> 00:49:56,536
j“ I hacked him with my machete so bad
that even I got freaked out j“

637
00:49:56,619 --> 00:49:59,581
j“ I jumped back, dodging his attack j“

638
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:04,210
j“ and in one fell swoop
I cut off his tail j“

00:50:04,419 --> 00:50:06,254
