1
00:00:01,898 --> 00:00:05,000
- <i>Previously on "Gotham"...</i>
- You left me the virus.

2
00:00:05,094 --> 00:00:06,582
You've got two options.

3
00:00:06,653 --> 00:00:09,055
You can take the virus
and find the strength

4
00:00:09,123 --> 00:00:10,818
and get out of there. Or...

5
00:00:11,013 --> 00:00:13,849
you can make that coffin
your permanent home.

6
00:00:21,168 --> 00:00:22,335
Fish?

7
00:00:22,402 --> 00:00:23,769
Why are you here?

8
00:00:23,837 --> 00:00:26,939
- I was alive.
- Good-bye, Fish!

9
00:00:30,443 --> 00:00:31,615
Then I was dead.

10
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:34,380
Let's try subject 13, shall we?

11
00:00:38,318 --> 00:00:40,086
And then, I was alive.

12
00:00:43,561 --> 00:00:44,631
Impossible.

13
00:00:44,905 --> 00:00:46,733
Nothing...

14
00:00:47,127 --> 00:00:48,624
is impossible.

15
00:00:52,599 --> 00:00:54,300
Things are looking up.

16
00:00:54,614 --> 00:00:57,864
My little Penguin and I will be leaving.

17
00:00:59,067 --> 00:01:02,742
This detonator will trigger the bomb.

18
00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:05,508
Thousands will be
infected with the virus.

19
00:01:05,585 --> 00:01:08,788
Let Gotham fall so you may rise.

20
00:01:08,867 --> 00:01:10,594
I won't have him
turn you into a murderer.

21
00:01:10,781 --> 00:01:13,028
No. You will press it!

22
00:01:15,422 --> 00:01:17,122
When you're ready, come and find me.

23
00:01:31,772 --> 00:01:33,447
Oh, my.

24
00:01:33,582 --> 00:01:35,216
What's happening out there?

25
00:01:36,577 --> 00:01:38,611
My money, my savings.

26
00:01:38,679 --> 00:01:40,762
- My savings.
- Excuse me, what?

27
00:01:40,848 --> 00:01:44,195
My-my money, my savings.
I want my money, my savings.

28
00:01:44,236 --> 00:01:46,993
- What's your account number?
- My whole life.

29
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:49,087
My money, my savings.

30
00:01:49,198 --> 00:01:51,305
I want my savings.

31
00:01:51,351 --> 00:01:54,288
- My money, my savings.
- Uh, this account was closed

32
00:01:54,355 --> 00:01:56,323
- due to unpaid fees.
- No, my money,

33
00:01:56,391 --> 00:01:57,758
my savings, my life.

34
00:01:57,825 --> 00:01:59,192
- You have no money.
- Everything.

35
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,161
The account is closed.

36
00:02:01,529 --> 00:02:04,244
Give me my money now!

37
00:02:04,269 --> 00:02:06,566
Oh, God. Um, security?

38
00:02:06,634 --> 00:02:07,901
Hey, what are you...

39
00:02:11,951 --> 00:02:14,376
My money, my savings.

40
00:02:14,465 --> 00:02:15,966
Now!

41
00:02:16,744 --> 00:02:19,713
Hey, I'm paying for this.

42
00:02:24,218 --> 00:02:26,268
Get out!

43
00:02:26,393 --> 00:02:27,988
Come here! Come back!

44
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:29,761
Buy our cookies!

45
00:02:47,387 --> 00:02:49,353
Move on.

46
00:03:08,811 --> 00:03:10,210
Killer...

47
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:13,661
killer...

48
00:03:14,052 --> 00:03:15,885
you're a killer.

49
00:03:17,257 --> 00:03:19,502
Killer...

50
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,585
Killer...

51
00:03:21,793 --> 00:03:23,559
Killer!

52
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,136
Jim?

53
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,074
You okay?

54
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:30,919
Fine.

55
00:03:35,826 --> 00:03:37,882
I'm fine, Harvey.

56
00:03:38,228 --> 00:03:40,264
Listen, I hate to do this to you, pal.

57
00:03:40,491 --> 00:03:42,402
But I'm gonna have to ask for your gun.

58
00:03:42,871 --> 00:03:44,866
This virus is tearing the city apart.

59
00:03:44,902 --> 00:03:47,090
You need me. I can control this.

60
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,304
That's why I'm not
asking for your badge.

61
00:03:49,559 --> 00:03:51,699
Some of the guys are talking.

62
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:54,709
These cops are gonna be watching you
for the smallest sign.

63
00:03:54,957 --> 00:03:57,056
Okay? And if you've got a gun,

64
00:03:57,081 --> 00:03:58,313
they'll be double jumpy.

65
00:03:58,348 --> 00:04:00,199
It's for your own protection.

66
00:04:07,391 --> 00:04:08,723
Any word on Lee?

67
00:04:09,174 --> 00:04:11,493
Nada. What happened after the bombing?

68
00:04:11,528 --> 00:04:14,115
A mob of infected
swarmed the clock tower.

69
00:04:14,162 --> 00:04:16,064
- She disappeared in the chaos.
- I don't get it.

70
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,365
She went through all that effort

71
00:04:17,401 --> 00:04:19,868
to get you infected with
the virus and she just bolts?

72
00:04:19,903 --> 00:04:21,503
She saw I was fighting it.

73
00:04:22,806 --> 00:04:24,980
She's waiting for me to give over to it.

74
00:04:26,417 --> 00:04:28,743
Prove her wrong.

75
00:04:32,464 --> 00:04:34,300
Where's Bruce?

76
00:04:48,127 --> 00:04:50,017
Detective Gordon.

77
00:04:51,001 --> 00:04:52,314
Alfred.

78
00:04:52,837 --> 00:04:54,402
Has he said anything?

79
00:04:54,564 --> 00:04:57,092
No, no, he just sits there staring.

80
00:04:57,975 --> 00:05:00,041
I need to talk to him, Harvey.

81
00:05:00,185 --> 00:05:01,643
We sure that's not the clone?

82
00:05:01,787 --> 00:05:03,185
No, that's Bruce.

83
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:05,046
God knows what those
bastards done to him,

84
00:05:05,076 --> 00:05:06,560
but he's only brainwashed.

85
00:05:06,783 --> 00:05:08,850
Are you really the best
person to talk to him?

86
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:11,052
I mean, from what you said, you
killed his mentor or something.

87
00:05:11,088 --> 00:05:12,320
He might be a bit peeved.

88
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:16,910
Listen, whatever they did to him,
that is Bruce Wayne in there.

89
00:05:17,004 --> 00:05:19,227
That boy is stronger than
you can possibly imagine.

90
00:05:20,148 --> 00:05:22,281
I just need to make him remember...

91
00:05:23,335 --> 00:05:24,726
who he is.

92
00:05:25,269 --> 00:05:27,035
As long as he doesn't
leave the precinct.

93
00:05:28,026 --> 00:05:29,704
Harvey, something you need to see.

94
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,249
An antidote?
Lucius, I could kiss your face.

95
00:05:41,285 --> 00:05:43,351
Before you do that, I don't
actually have the formula.

96
00:05:43,387 --> 00:05:45,239
But there is an antidote?
That's what you're saying?

97
00:05:45,264 --> 00:05:46,185
I was going through the papers

98
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:47,689
you recovered from
the Owl leader's house.

99
00:05:47,724 --> 00:05:49,324
They suggest that while
Strange was working

100
00:05:49,359 --> 00:05:50,792
to weaponize the Tetch virus,

101
00:05:50,827 --> 00:05:52,870
he was also working
on a parallel project,

102
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:55,692
tailoring different antiviral
agents to his own ends.

103
00:05:55,799 --> 00:05:57,732
Strange was designing an antidote.

104
00:05:57,768 --> 00:05:59,201
That makes sense.

105
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,835
The Court was careful
to protect its own.

106
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,346
They would want a safeguard.

107
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,773
We need to talk to Strange.

108
00:06:04,992 --> 00:06:06,962
Is he still here or has he been moved?

109
00:06:07,044 --> 00:06:09,642
Uh, well, when you were
buried in the coffin

110
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,446
and the city was
about to be virus-bombed,

111
00:06:11,485 --> 00:06:12,735
some decisions had to be made.

112
00:06:12,816 --> 00:06:14,165
Harvey...

113
00:06:14,993 --> 00:06:16,921
I told Alfred to question Strange.

114
00:06:17,026 --> 00:06:18,564
In exchange for him telling us

115
00:06:18,589 --> 00:06:21,289
where the bombing was
gonna go down, Alfred

116
00:06:21,337 --> 00:06:24,423
let Strange walk. Yes,
I'm blaming it on the butler.

117
00:06:26,697 --> 00:06:29,397
All right. Strange is a weasel.

118
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:32,517
He'd try to get as far away
from this as possible.

119
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:34,302
Union Station is shut down.

120
00:06:34,338 --> 00:06:36,404
Downtown train station's our best bet.

121
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,006
Okay. Wait up.

122
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,518
Harvey?

123
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:42,006
Lucius, I know what
you're gonna say, all right?

124
00:06:42,099 --> 00:06:43,144
He can handle this.

125
00:06:43,172 --> 00:06:45,872
Hell, Barnes had the virus
for weeks before anyone knew.

126
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,883
What I was going to say:
from all I see here,

127
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:52,128
Strange's virus is an accelerated
version of the Tetch virus.

128
00:06:52,253 --> 00:06:54,315
Why do you think people
are reacting so quickly?

129
00:06:54,667 --> 00:06:56,979
Gordon isn't going to be able
to fight this for long.

130
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,375
Well, we'll just have to
wait and see, huh?

131
00:06:59,515 --> 00:07:01,533
You keep working on that antidote.

132
00:07:04,536 --> 00:07:07,124
One second, one second,
one ticket at a time.

133
00:07:12,542 --> 00:07:15,477
Go get what's her name.

134
00:07:15,512 --> 00:07:16,878
Sir, excuse me!

135
00:07:23,341 --> 00:07:24,826
Ooh.

136
00:07:24,904 --> 00:07:26,254
Excuse me.

137
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:29,324
Oh, no.

138
00:07:30,594 --> 00:07:32,894
I think you mean, "Hello, Fish.

139
00:07:33,317 --> 00:07:35,043
I miss you."

140
00:07:35,299 --> 00:07:37,309
And don't worry, sweetheart.

141
00:07:37,501 --> 00:07:39,834
The fun has just begun.

142
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:52,318
"As the flames of henism

143
00:07:52,624 --> 00:07:57,093
licked the very foundation
of its society..."

144
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,930
"...Nero played and sang

145
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,047
'The Destruction of Troy.'"

146
00:08:07,205 --> 00:08:09,815
I will say this about the Court of Owls:

147
00:08:10,315 --> 00:08:13,809
they have style.

148
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:18,247
Not to mention they've handed us
the perfect opportunity.

149
00:08:18,283 --> 00:08:19,708
For what?

150
00:08:19,841 --> 00:08:21,950
The city is in total disarray.

151
00:08:22,247 --> 00:08:24,820
What better time to consolidate power?

152
00:08:25,473 --> 00:08:26,950
Barbara,

153
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:29,458
I've told you again and again,

154
00:08:29,494 --> 00:08:32,691
I have no interest in running Gotham.

155
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:36,010
- I only want...
- To kill Penguin. Yes.

156
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:37,900
I got it the first billion times.

157
00:08:37,936 --> 00:08:39,235
And where is he now? Oh!

158
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:41,737
That's right, with Fish Mooney.

159
00:08:41,773 --> 00:08:43,039
So we find her.

160
00:08:43,074 --> 00:08:45,541
And then what? You blast through

161
00:08:45,576 --> 00:08:47,877
her army of goons
until you get to Oswald?

162
00:08:47,992 --> 00:08:50,007
You're gonna need muscle, honey.

163
00:08:50,077 --> 00:08:51,444
Which you provide.

164
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:54,460
Oh, so you expect my help?

165
00:08:54,694 --> 00:08:56,928
But when I need yours,

166
00:08:57,178 --> 00:09:01,846
to take advantage of an
opportunity of a lifetime...

167
00:09:02,354 --> 00:09:04,018
...nothing.

168
00:09:07,796 --> 00:09:09,499
Baby.

169
00:09:10,632 --> 00:09:12,868
Listen, all I ask

170
00:09:13,077 --> 00:09:16,771
is that you use this beautiful

171
00:09:16,896 --> 00:09:18,927
big brain of yours

172
00:09:19,122 --> 00:09:21,599
to help me, finally,

173
00:09:22,369 --> 00:09:25,564
get this city under my thumb.

174
00:09:26,073 --> 00:09:27,717
And afterwards,

175
00:09:27,752 --> 00:09:31,721
I will help you
pry Penguin away from Fish.

176
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:34,580
Deal?

177
00:09:36,221 --> 00:09:39,377
I will give you a day.

178
00:09:44,758 --> 00:09:46,434
I thought we were friends.

179
00:09:46,501 --> 00:09:50,606
When the Court of Owls calls,
o-one does not refuse.

180
00:09:50,676 --> 00:09:53,090
Still, I'm not upset.

181
00:09:53,465 --> 00:09:56,712
I knew when your old
masters summoned you,

182
00:09:56,864 --> 00:10:00,629
it was to cook up some horror,
and here's the thing:

183
00:10:00,752 --> 00:10:02,485
I need horror.

184
00:10:02,863 --> 00:10:04,787
They're responsible
for all of this, aren't they?

185
00:10:05,035 --> 00:10:08,108
At the behest of the Court,
I weaponized a virus

186
00:10:08,178 --> 00:10:10,420
that releases a person's darkest urges.

187
00:10:10,891 --> 00:10:13,412
Thousands have been infected.

188
00:10:13,998 --> 00:10:16,132
So where is this virus?

189
00:10:16,772 --> 00:10:18,968
I know there's more.

190
00:10:19,003 --> 00:10:21,779
It has all been used. Please, I must go.

191
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:25,809
Don't. You will give me the virus,

192
00:10:25,918 --> 00:10:30,413
you will make me the army you promised,

193
00:10:30,525 --> 00:10:34,642
you will do everything I say

194
00:10:34,775 --> 00:10:39,255
until this city
is in the palm of my hand.

195
00:10:40,021 --> 00:10:41,638
Are we clear?

196
00:10:42,177 --> 00:10:43,849
Yes, madam.

197
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,004
Sorry, folks, this exit's off...

198
00:11:03,572 --> 00:11:05,481
I'll look around for the station cop,

199
00:11:05,516 --> 00:11:06,949
see if he found Strange.

200
00:11:08,986 --> 00:11:10,565
Hello?

201
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:13,556
Oh, geez. He's right here.

202
00:11:18,396 --> 00:11:20,602
- This is Gordon.
<i>- Hi, Jim.</i>

203
00:11:20,906 --> 00:11:24,242
<i>I was just checking in,
seeing how you're feeling.</i>

204
00:11:24,535 --> 00:11:26,395
<i>Crazy day, huh?</i>

205
00:11:26,571 --> 00:11:27,870
Lee, where are you?

206
00:11:27,905 --> 00:11:29,793
<i>Somewhere very familiar to you.</i>

207
00:11:30,191 --> 00:11:32,034
I know how you're feeling.

208
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:35,187
All that blood rushing
through your veins,

209
00:11:35,249 --> 00:11:36,312
your heart beating

210
00:11:36,347 --> 00:11:38,368
<i>faster and faster.</i>

211
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,051
Listen to me,

212
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,215
<i>you need to turn yourself in;
it's not safe.</i>

213
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,340
<i>The infected are being killed
all over the city.</i>

214
00:11:46,365 --> 00:11:48,646
Wow, you're really fighting this, huh?

215
00:11:48,852 --> 00:11:50,315
<i>You know, you don't have to.</i>

216
00:11:50,823 --> 00:11:53,675
<i>The cage is finally open, Jim.</i>

217
00:11:53,753 --> 00:11:55,073
<i>You're free.</i>

218
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:57,166
- No.
- <i>I thought you loved me.</i>

219
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,902
I thought you wanted us to be together.

220
00:11:59,963 --> 00:12:01,602
Not like this.

221
00:12:02,219 --> 00:12:03,531
<i>Well...</i>

222
00:12:04,775 --> 00:12:06,578
...this is the only way, Jim.

223
00:12:06,711 --> 00:12:08,595
<i>Just listen to the whispers.</i>

224
00:12:10,581 --> 00:12:12,047
<i>Killer.</i>

225
00:12:13,084 --> 00:12:15,254
They'll lead you to me,

226
00:12:15,793 --> 00:12:17,371
tell you who you are.

227
00:12:17,485 --> 00:12:18,985
<i>Killer.</i>

228
00:12:19,123 --> 00:12:20,356
That's not who I am.

229
00:12:20,564 --> 00:12:22,486
<i>I wonder what they're saying.</i>

230
00:12:22,869 --> 00:12:26,189
<i>That you like hurting people,
killing people?</i>

231
00:12:26,297 --> 00:12:27,358
<i>Killer.</i>

232
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:29,748
See how well I know you, Jim.

233
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:32,545
<i>Now I'm gonna go have some fun.</i>

234
00:12:32,771 --> 00:12:34,303
<i>We'll catch up soon.</i>

235
00:12:34,904 --> 00:12:36,304
Promise.

236
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:44,001
<i>Killer... killer...</i>

237
00:12:44,205 --> 00:12:46,041
<i>you're a killer.</i>

238
00:12:47,746 --> 00:12:50,051
Jim! Jim.

239
00:12:50,284 --> 00:12:51,620
Someone spotted Strange.

240
00:12:53,464 --> 00:12:56,003
Just don't shoot any
innocent bystanders.

241
00:12:56,104 --> 00:12:58,260
Or me. Especially me.

242
00:13:04,364 --> 00:13:07,340
- GCPD!
- Don't move!

243
00:13:07,752 --> 00:13:09,452
Fish?

244
00:13:10,109 --> 00:13:11,601
What a surprise.

245
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:14,476
My goodness, Harvey, you look awful.

246
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:16,145
It's good to see you, too.

247
00:13:16,277 --> 00:13:18,647
We just want Strange. You can walk away.

248
00:13:18,691 --> 00:13:21,144
Yeah. Uh, no.

249
00:13:21,352 --> 00:13:23,986
Fish, I know in your own
sick way, you love this city,

250
00:13:24,021 --> 00:13:25,888
and Gotham is bleeding to death.

251
00:13:25,923 --> 00:13:28,057
We need this dirtbag to fix it.

252
00:13:28,092 --> 00:13:30,258
Enough talking. Hand him over.

253
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:32,142
He has it.

254
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:34,704
It's in his eyes.

255
00:13:34,775 --> 00:13:37,606
He has the virus.

256
00:13:37,802 --> 00:13:39,335
Really?

257
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:43,138
So tell me, James,

258
00:13:43,426 --> 00:13:45,473
what's it feel like?

259
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:49,041
Like it's taking all my willpower...

260
00:13:49,413 --> 00:13:50,579
not to kill you.

261
00:13:51,392 --> 00:13:52,720
Ooh, my.

262
00:13:52,783 --> 00:13:56,397
Harvey, when you say Hugo
here can save the city,

263
00:13:56,459 --> 00:13:57,632
does that mean there's a...

264
00:13:58,155 --> 00:14:00,022
cure for this virus?

265
00:14:00,124 --> 00:14:02,358
Fish, I swear to God,
if you don't step back,

266
00:14:02,444 --> 00:14:05,094
I will shoot you and
these two nimrods right here,

267
00:14:05,129 --> 00:14:06,095
right now!

268
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:08,264
Hugo, is it true

269
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:12,024
that you're the only one
that can stop this madness?

270
00:14:12,737 --> 00:14:13,836
Mm-hmm.

271
00:14:15,906 --> 00:14:18,229
Obviously, I can't give him up now.

272
00:14:18,309 --> 00:14:20,282
Fine, you had your chance.

273
00:14:20,353 --> 00:14:23,145
Oh.

274
00:14:28,352 --> 00:14:31,654
Did you really think that I
would come without backup?

275
00:14:32,758 --> 00:14:35,200
<i>- You're a killer.</i>
- Jim,

276
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:37,726
- dial it down, buddy.
- Victor,

277
00:14:37,896 --> 00:14:41,063
looks like our little
Detective Gordon is overheating.

278
00:14:41,217 --> 00:14:42,931
Perhaps you should cool him off.

279
00:14:42,967 --> 00:14:44,199
Both of them.

280
00:14:58,015 --> 00:14:59,148
Marvelous.

281
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:02,084
Just marvelous.

282
00:15:05,289 --> 00:15:07,256
There he is,

283
00:15:07,702 --> 00:15:09,989
the real James Gordon.

284
00:15:11,489 --> 00:15:14,512
Nice to meet you, at last.

285
00:15:27,845 --> 00:15:31,418
There we go, Master Bruce.
Two lumps, just how you like it.

286
00:15:31,988 --> 00:15:33,934
You hungry, mate?

287
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,933
Can I whip you up a sandwich?

288
00:15:38,789 --> 00:15:41,290
Anyway, if all goes well,
we should be able to

289
00:15:41,325 --> 00:15:43,402
head back to Wayne Manor tomorrow.

290
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:47,389
Although, I was thinking
that we could go abroad.

291
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:49,258
We could go to Switzerland.

292
00:15:49,938 --> 00:15:52,179
I mean, we used to go with your
mum and dad this time of year.

293
00:15:52,204 --> 00:15:53,672
Stop it.

294
00:15:54,726 --> 00:15:57,074
Your attempts to elicit
an emotional response

295
00:15:57,122 --> 00:16:00,356
by reminding me of shared memories
is clumsy and pathetic.

296
00:16:03,412 --> 00:16:05,137
The last memory I have is of

297
00:16:05,162 --> 00:16:07,731
you killing the best friend
and teacher I ever had.

298
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:11,123
You mean that old geezer that...

299
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,102
kidnapped you, poisoned your mind,

300
00:16:13,195 --> 00:16:15,430
then tried to turn you
into a mass murderer.

301
00:16:16,172 --> 00:16:18,156
Let me tell you something, Master Bruce:

302
00:16:18,188 --> 00:16:22,582
that man lied to you.

303
00:16:22,909 --> 00:16:25,165
Him and his bloody Court of Owls,

304
00:16:25,236 --> 00:16:27,978
they tried to use you,
they tried to manipulate you.

305
00:16:28,032 --> 00:16:29,330
You say he was a liar.

306
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:32,708
How?

307
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:36,007
By taking away the pain
I've carried for years?

308
00:16:36,032 --> 00:16:37,476
By giving me revenge against the people

309
00:16:37,501 --> 00:16:38,914
who killed my mother and father?

310
00:16:41,962 --> 00:16:43,594
That's more than you ever did.

311
00:16:48,626 --> 00:16:51,193
Anyway, the Court of Owls
does not matter.

312
00:16:52,108 --> 00:16:55,531
They merely paved the way
for the one who is to come.

313
00:16:56,371 --> 00:16:58,033
What do you mean?

314
00:16:59,804 --> 00:17:01,824
Who-who's coming?

315
00:17:05,394 --> 00:17:06,956
You'll see.

316
00:17:10,391 --> 00:17:12,967
- I should cook him.
- They want him alive.

317
00:17:12,992 --> 00:17:14,422
So I'll just cook part of him.

318
00:17:14,508 --> 00:17:16,500
Oh, no, my dear.

319
00:17:16,718 --> 00:17:19,742
- Let's be calm.
- You don't have that kind of control.

320
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,047
And you do?

321
00:17:21,195 --> 00:17:23,954
In my hands,
this flamethrower is a scalpel.

322
00:17:24,012 --> 00:17:24,978
Fine.

323
00:17:25,048 --> 00:17:26,712
We each take a foot.

324
00:17:27,228 --> 00:17:29,434
Whoever goes above the ankle loses.

325
00:17:29,512 --> 00:17:30,704
You're on.

326
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,879
No. N-No. Stop!

327
00:17:32,942 --> 00:17:34,969
Ms. Mooney! Ms. Mooney!

328
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,633
Mooney's busy.

329
00:17:38,008 --> 00:17:40,196
I'm here now.

330
00:17:42,524 --> 00:17:44,024
Mmm.

331
00:17:44,236 --> 00:17:46,787
Also, I think your children
are angry with you.

332
00:17:46,892 --> 00:17:49,744
- Mr. Cobblepot.
- It's understandable.

333
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:53,869
You made them what they are,

334
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,030
then abandoned them.

335
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:59,047
You are working with Ms. Mooney?

336
00:17:59,373 --> 00:18:00,927
We're partners.

337
00:18:01,138 --> 00:18:03,211
But you tried to kill her.

338
00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:05,880
And she forgave me.

339
00:18:06,346 --> 00:18:08,338
I know. Surprised me, too.

340
00:18:08,471 --> 00:18:11,151
But, Mooney is not the old Mooney.

341
00:18:11,284 --> 00:18:13,204
She has evolved.

342
00:18:13,274 --> 00:18:15,423
And she has a vision for Gotham.

343
00:18:16,188 --> 00:18:19,627
She sees a city where
people like myself,

344
00:18:20,158 --> 00:18:23,971
Victor, Bridgit... freaks...

345
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,190
are in charge.

346
00:18:28,138 --> 00:18:30,449
And you are gonna help us achieve that.

347
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:34,597
- I can't.
- Wrong, Professor!

348
00:18:35,298 --> 00:18:39,074
This virus is tearing Gotham apart.

349
00:18:39,269 --> 00:18:43,256
That makes your antidote the
most valuable thing in the city.

350
00:18:43,657 --> 00:18:46,537
We could demand half of Gotham

351
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:49,482
and the city council
deliver it to us on a platter.

352
00:18:49,631 --> 00:18:53,161
So, I'm going to ask you once,

353
00:18:53,857 --> 00:18:55,163
where is it?

354
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,404
If I tell you where the antidote is,

355
00:19:00,162 --> 00:19:01,769
I have nothing.

356
00:19:03,152 --> 00:19:04,639
I can't.

357
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,777
You can torture me all you want.

358
00:19:12,956 --> 00:19:14,215
Okay.

359
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,042
What?

360
00:19:16,105 --> 00:19:19,864
You know, when I was in Arkham,
I was tortured daily.

361
00:19:19,889 --> 00:19:22,920
Oh. Well, that was therapy, Oswald.

362
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:24,725
Therapy.

363
00:19:26,651 --> 00:19:28,718
And that device you used

364
00:19:28,761 --> 00:19:30,961
to administer the therapy,

365
00:19:31,299 --> 00:19:32,502
remember that?

366
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:35,232
It gave the sensation

367
00:19:35,534 --> 00:19:37,868
that your head was being torn open

368
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:41,839
so that hot lava could be poured
directly into your brain.

369
00:19:42,183 --> 00:19:43,607
Afterwards,

370
00:19:44,144 --> 00:19:47,261
just thinking of it
would make me physically ill.

371
00:19:51,348 --> 00:19:54,020
So, naturally, I had to have it.

372
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:01,358
- Oh!
- One moment, Oswald.

373
00:20:01,453 --> 00:20:03,372
No! All right, all right!

374
00:20:03,397 --> 00:20:05,296
I'll-I'll tell you anything
you need to know.

375
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:08,147
- I'll tell you where the antidote is.
- I know.

376
00:20:09,144 --> 00:20:11,816
But not just yet, 'kay?

377
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,932
What?

378
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,545
They're not answering at the precinct.
They must be overwhelmed.

379
00:20:26,678 --> 00:20:28,882
Well, we're not shooting our way out.

380
00:20:29,212 --> 00:20:30,678
<i>Killer.</i>

381
00:20:34,337 --> 00:20:35,536
Jim, take it easy.

382
00:20:35,561 --> 00:20:36,717
Someone will come!

383
00:20:36,742 --> 00:20:38,825
Yeah, and by then,
Mooney will have gotten Strange

384
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:40,115
to give her the antidote!

385
00:20:40,185 --> 00:20:41,490
We're running out of time!

386
00:20:45,894 --> 00:20:47,515
<i>Killer.</i>

387
00:20:47,765 --> 00:20:50,703
<i>Killer. Killer.</i>

388
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,710
<i>Killer!</i>

389
00:21:07,415 --> 00:21:09,782
I knew you could do it.

390
00:21:13,777 --> 00:21:16,027
Come on, Jim! Fight it!

391
00:21:16,715 --> 00:21:18,465
Fight the damn virus!

392
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,495
Not my car. That's my car!

393
00:21:23,753 --> 00:21:25,243
Let me drive.

394
00:21:25,921 --> 00:21:27,754
Alvarez, spread the word,

395
00:21:27,805 --> 00:21:30,009
Mayor James has called in
the National Guard.

396
00:21:30,297 --> 00:21:32,704
We don't want any soldiers
getting shot by mistake.

397
00:21:32,806 --> 00:21:33,884
Leave me alone.

398
00:21:34,298 --> 00:21:36,202
The hell's wrong with you?

399
00:21:37,123 --> 00:21:39,288
Alvarez, I'm talking to you.

400
00:21:39,577 --> 00:21:42,717
I said leave me alone!

401
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:49,449
So, I will ask you again.

402
00:21:49,699 --> 00:21:51,246
Who's coming?

403
00:21:51,636 --> 00:21:53,496
I mean, I thought
the man that I dispatched

404
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:56,101
at Wayne Enterprises was the
leader of the Court of Owls.

405
00:21:56,179 --> 00:21:57,408
I want you to leave.

406
00:21:57,538 --> 00:21:59,319
Yeah, well, that ain't
gonna happen, is it, mate?

407
00:21:59,601 --> 00:22:01,858
You can't get rid of me that easy.

408
00:22:02,272 --> 00:22:04,358
You have to remember

409
00:22:04,921 --> 00:22:06,207
who you are.

410
00:22:06,387 --> 00:22:10,192
I know who I am. I have a destiny.

411
00:22:10,387 --> 00:22:12,199
Now, you listen to me.

412
00:22:12,942 --> 00:22:17,079
That man that wanted you
to detonate that bomb...

413
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:19,470
whatever he promised you...

414
00:22:19,572 --> 00:22:22,400
freedom from pain, power... none of it,

415
00:22:22,704 --> 00:22:24,056
none of it was real.

416
00:22:24,126 --> 00:22:26,770
I want you to remember what is real.

417
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:28,281
I know what's real!

418
00:22:28,417 --> 00:22:30,641
I got vengeance for my parents' murder.

419
00:22:30,665 --> 00:22:32,383
That's real!

420
00:22:33,766 --> 00:22:35,516
No.

421
00:22:36,649 --> 00:22:38,582
No, that's not real.

422
00:22:41,253 --> 00:22:42,850
What's real

423
00:22:43,522 --> 00:22:46,968
is every time that you were sick
when you were a kid...

424
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,351
your mum used to sit up
with you all night

425
00:22:50,463 --> 00:22:52,763
and read to you till you
fell asleep. That's real.

426
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:56,881
Or when you were seven and you
took your silly rowing boat out

427
00:22:56,927 --> 00:22:58,896
and you got lost in that storm,

428
00:22:58,938 --> 00:23:01,318
and me and your dad were out,
shouting and screaming,

429
00:23:01,365 --> 00:23:03,006
losing our minds.

430
00:23:03,042 --> 00:23:06,973
And when your dad found you,
how he cried.

431
00:23:09,114 --> 00:23:10,647
That's real.

432
00:23:11,739 --> 00:23:12,916
Yes...

433
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:16,793
your parents died in that alley
three years ago

434
00:23:16,818 --> 00:23:19,638
and maybe that man took away
the pain of that night.

435
00:23:20,295 --> 00:23:24,303
But there is no life,
there is no love without pain.

436
00:23:26,073 --> 00:23:29,210
He could not touch the love
that your mom and dad gave you,

437
00:23:29,235 --> 00:23:32,952
that you still have it in you,
that you still have in here.

438
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:38,591
The same love that I have for you.

439
00:23:42,982 --> 00:23:45,465
I love you, Master Bruce.

440
00:23:46,978 --> 00:23:48,551
I would do anything for you.

441
00:23:48,654 --> 00:23:50,223
I would die for you.

442
00:23:51,856 --> 00:23:53,325
You must...

443
00:23:53,692 --> 00:23:55,536
find that love again.

444
00:23:59,692 --> 00:24:02,262
Come back to me, Master Bruce.

445
00:24:53,219 --> 00:24:54,218
Thank you very much.

446
00:24:54,758 --> 00:24:56,250
No problem.

447
00:24:56,468 --> 00:24:57,600
Excuse me.

448
00:25:03,918 --> 00:25:05,695
Oh, bloody hell.

449
00:25:12,258 --> 00:25:13,438
What I'm saying is

450
00:25:13,516 --> 00:25:15,391
if Penguin and Fish have hooked up,

451
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:18,131
things are gonna get
real bad, real fast.

452
00:25:18,276 --> 00:25:20,206
- You want to run?
- No.

453
00:25:20,345 --> 00:25:22,925
I'm saying maybe she takes care
of Barbara and Nygma for us.

454
00:25:23,042 --> 00:25:24,464
I mean, we can even help things along.

455
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:26,401
Send word to Fish
about where Babs is weak.

456
00:25:28,378 --> 00:25:29,784
This is our shot.

457
00:25:33,014 --> 00:25:34,046
I'm not ready.

458
00:25:37,639 --> 00:25:39,437
What the hell is she doing here?

459
00:25:41,015 --> 00:25:42,855
One whiskey. Here you go.

460
00:25:52,266 --> 00:25:53,899
Well, this is a strange day.

461
00:25:56,284 --> 00:25:57,917
Never thought I'd see you in here.

462
00:25:58,604 --> 00:26:01,233
Had some time to kill
while my ex sees the light.

463
00:26:01,258 --> 00:26:03,054
Figured I'd have a little fun.

464
00:26:03,825 --> 00:26:05,324
Where's Babs?

465
00:26:05,844 --> 00:26:08,628
- What do you want with her?
- None of your business, errand boy.

466
00:26:10,477 --> 00:26:12,465
I'm sorry, what did you call me?

467
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,708
I'm sorry, you're not an errand boy.

468
00:26:15,224 --> 00:26:17,103
You're more of a shoeshine boy.

469
00:26:17,239 --> 00:26:19,879
They should give you a little stand
in the front, cute little hat.

470
00:26:19,965 --> 00:26:23,043
- That's more your speed.
- Right. Out.

471
00:26:25,082 --> 00:26:26,812
- Oh.
- Yeah.

472
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:35,944
Oh...

473
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,293
You've got the virus.

474
00:26:40,444 --> 00:26:41,994
Wow, you're not as dumb as I've heard.

475
00:26:42,194 --> 00:26:44,364
Are there any other glaringly
obvious remarks you'd like to make?

476
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:47,466
How about I cut your lungs out
and show them to you?

477
00:26:47,575 --> 00:26:49,068
Wow, that's incredibly vivid.

478
00:26:49,247 --> 00:26:50,966
I'd like to see you try it.

479
00:26:51,573 --> 00:26:54,185
But I'm here for your boss,
the crazy blonde.

480
00:26:54,388 --> 00:26:56,208
- She's not my boss.
- Uh-huh.

481
00:26:56,357 --> 00:26:59,560
I may have a virus making me
freakishly strong and mildly insane,

482
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:02,481
but even I know that you were
a sidekick to your brother

483
00:27:02,517 --> 00:27:03,919
and you're a sidekick to Barbara.

484
00:27:04,085 --> 00:27:08,168
So, can you send her a message for me?

485
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:09,221
Would you?

486
00:27:09,927 --> 00:27:11,891
Your boss...

487
00:27:12,498 --> 00:27:14,193
...tell her next time I see her,

488
00:27:14,256 --> 00:27:15,962
I'm gonna rip her head
right off her body.

489
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,232
Bye now.

490
00:27:28,765 --> 00:27:30,984
- God...
- What, you need help?

491
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,226
<i>It's all criminal activity.</i>

492
00:27:48,363 --> 00:27:50,195
<i>Go back inside.</i>

493
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:53,976
<i>- Gotham curfew.</i>
- Got him.

494
00:27:54,291 --> 00:27:55,619
<i>Shut down.</i>

495
00:27:55,728 --> 00:27:59,208
<i>All individuals must remain indoors.</i>

496
00:27:59,474 --> 00:28:03,575
<i>Any activity outdoors
will be considered criminal activity.</i>

497
00:28:06,147 --> 00:28:07,855
Clear here.

498
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,113
Let's go, let's go. Clear out.

499
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,720
<i>Remain indoors.</i>

500
00:28:13,955 --> 00:28:16,043
He's following directions or something.

501
00:28:16,105 --> 00:28:17,949
I've got to find out
who's controlling him,

502
00:28:18,418 --> 00:28:19,918
who's brainwashed him.

503
00:28:20,387 --> 00:28:21,643
And then what?

504
00:28:23,264 --> 00:28:25,598
I'm gonna kill the bastard.

505
00:28:29,962 --> 00:28:31,814
You two wait here.

506
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,339
Professor, if this is a trap,

507
00:28:33,374 --> 00:28:34,840
you will soon find yourself hanging

508
00:28:34,876 --> 00:28:36,776
- with the rest of the meat.
- It's no trap.

509
00:28:37,103 --> 00:28:40,819
I tested earlier versions of the virus
and the antidote on livestock.

510
00:28:40,934 --> 00:28:43,368
I made sure to set aside
a successful batch.

511
00:28:43,764 --> 00:28:46,499
This place gives me the creeps.

512
00:28:46,636 --> 00:28:48,178
I like it.

513
00:29:04,005 --> 00:29:05,538
It's concentrated.

514
00:29:06,106 --> 00:29:07,950
Once you dilute it,

515
00:29:08,309 --> 00:29:13,579
there is enough here to cure
every infected person in Gotham.

516
00:29:14,633 --> 00:29:16,086
Hmm.

517
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:21,483
Oswald,

518
00:29:22,084 --> 00:29:25,959
you and I will rule this city together.

519
00:29:26,037 --> 00:29:27,199
Yes.

520
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:29,096
But first, I have to kill Ed Nygma.

521
00:29:29,283 --> 00:29:30,563
He has to die.

522
00:29:30,728 --> 00:29:32,572
Oh, he will.

523
00:29:33,697 --> 00:29:37,143
And all those who try
to stand in our way.

524
00:29:43,087 --> 00:29:44,753
What's this?

525
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,568
Who's there?

526
00:29:52,106 --> 00:29:53,895
Show yourself.

527
00:30:04,098 --> 00:30:05,379
Who are they?

528
00:30:05,605 --> 00:30:07,199
Don't look at me, I don't know.

529
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:11,799
Really? That's all you've got?

530
00:30:14,869 --> 00:30:18,210
Hand over the antidote now.

531
00:30:33,802 --> 00:30:37,242
I want the Strike Force and
all available units there now.

532
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,669
I'm on my way.

533
00:30:38,709 --> 00:30:41,356
Reports of an ice storm and fireball
at an East Side slaughterhouse.

534
00:30:41,458 --> 00:30:44,550
- Do you think maybe...
- Just drive the damn car.

535
00:31:07,608 --> 00:31:09,608
Sweet mother mercy.

536
00:31:36,757 --> 00:31:38,179
<i>Killer.</i>

537
00:31:48,278 --> 00:31:50,301
You damn fool.

538
00:31:52,284 --> 00:31:54,022
Fish!

539
00:31:54,789 --> 00:31:56,565
Oswald.

540
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:02,255
It's okay. It's-it's o...
We can, we can get you some help.

541
00:32:02,366 --> 00:32:03,806
No, no, no.

542
00:32:04,107 --> 00:32:08,064
I've done this enough times
to know I'm finished.

543
00:32:08,105 --> 00:32:09,940
No. D-Do not say that.

544
00:32:09,965 --> 00:32:12,059
- We-we will get you help.
- Listen to me.

545
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,969
Listen to me.

546
00:32:19,196 --> 00:32:21,857
Make this city yours...

547
00:32:24,288 --> 00:32:28,100
...or you burn it to the ground.

548
00:32:57,635 --> 00:32:59,854
People call me a monster.

549
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:04,635
You, Jim Gordon,

550
00:33:04,784 --> 00:33:06,335
you're the mons...

551
00:33:08,473 --> 00:33:11,000
You're right. I am a monster.

552
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:18,114
- GCPD!
- Arrest them!

553
00:33:18,233 --> 00:33:19,834
All of them!

554
00:33:20,866 --> 00:33:22,498
Strange...

555
00:33:23,035 --> 00:33:26,287
You better tell me that you
can make more of that antidote.

556
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,214
Yes, yes.

557
00:33:29,427 --> 00:33:32,409
I just need one thing.

558
00:33:55,426 --> 00:33:56,859
How's it hanging?

559
00:34:03,299 --> 00:34:04,721
You sure about this?

560
00:34:04,861 --> 00:34:07,711
According to my sources,
Fish Mooney and the GCPD

561
00:34:07,736 --> 00:34:10,408
are scrambling to recover
the antidote to this virus.

562
00:34:10,535 --> 00:34:13,535
But Fish is dead.

563
00:34:13,804 --> 00:34:16,473
And Hugo Strange,
who designed the antidote,

564
00:34:16,801 --> 00:34:19,260
is setting up a lab in the GCPD,

565
00:34:19,293 --> 00:34:23,032
but they are missing one
very, very important element.

566
00:34:25,727 --> 00:34:29,377
So, yes, I am sure that this bozo

567
00:34:29,402 --> 00:34:30,761
is the key to controlling Gotham.

568
00:34:30,996 --> 00:34:32,988
Are you my saviors?

569
00:34:33,524 --> 00:34:35,501
Are you the ones to set me free?

570
00:34:36,414 --> 00:34:38,081
Not exactly.

571
00:34:40,358 --> 00:34:42,187
Let's make Gotham beg.

572
00:34:56,747 --> 00:35:00,073
<i>Seek out the Yuyan building.</i>

573
00:35:00,135 --> 00:35:02,823
<i>Find the demon's head.</i>

574
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:05,895
<i>Fulfill your destiny.</i>

575
00:36:34,365 --> 00:36:36,518
Right. Find Bullock,
let him know where we are.

576
00:36:37,689 --> 00:36:39,322
I'm gonna follow Bruce.

577
00:38:00,481 --> 00:38:02,426
I wouldn't touch that, Bruce.

578
00:38:05,389 --> 00:38:06,822
You know who I am?

579
00:38:07,109 --> 00:38:09,749
Who do you think told
the Sensei to send you here?

580
00:38:10,241 --> 00:38:11,812
He's dead.

581
00:38:12,743 --> 00:38:14,515
He was murdered.

582
00:38:15,022 --> 00:38:16,889
He died.

583
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:19,990
But he completed his task.

584
00:38:20,271 --> 00:38:25,037
The Court of Owls is destroyed,
Gotham burns, and you...

585
00:38:25,326 --> 00:38:26,531
are here.

586
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:28,516
He told me to complete my training,

587
00:38:28,852 --> 00:38:30,516
to find the demon's head.

588
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:32,594
You already have, Bruce.

589
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:35,110
I'm the one you seek.

590
00:38:35,852 --> 00:38:37,933
I'm the demon's head.

591
00:38:41,014 --> 00:38:43,616
I am Ra's al Ghul.

592
00:38:50,349 --> 00:38:52,255
Why have you come to me, Bruce?

593
00:38:52,349 --> 00:38:54,763
The Sensei told me to seek you out.

594
00:38:55,326 --> 00:38:57,002
That you would complete my training.

595
00:38:57,287 --> 00:39:00,546
And did the Sensei tell you
who I am, what I seek?

596
00:39:01,156 --> 00:39:03,788
I know you are not a part
of the Court of Owls,

597
00:39:03,891 --> 00:39:06,724
that you only used them.
But I don't know why.

598
00:39:08,484 --> 00:39:11,809
Then know that I have been alive
more years than you can imagine.

599
00:39:12,543 --> 00:39:14,137
That I have seen and done things

600
00:39:14,223 --> 00:39:17,270
that would shake the core
of everything you believe.

601
00:39:17,887 --> 00:39:20,825
That I'm thought to be a demon...

602
00:39:22,008 --> 00:39:23,501
a saint...

603
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:26,110
a ghost.

604
00:39:26,587 --> 00:39:30,627
But for all my years, all my travels,

605
00:39:31,272 --> 00:39:34,100
there is one thing
that I have never found:

606
00:39:35,085 --> 00:39:37,000
a true heir.

607
00:39:37,741 --> 00:39:39,526
But I need to know if you're ready.

608
00:39:40,292 --> 00:39:41,605
I am.

609
00:39:42,526 --> 00:39:43,840
The Sensei trained me.

610
00:39:45,105 --> 00:39:46,534
Are you?

611
00:39:47,308 --> 00:39:48,946
He set you a task.

612
00:39:49,719 --> 00:39:51,906
He asked you to be the one
that released the virus

613
00:39:51,969 --> 00:39:53,703
that now envelops this city.

614
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:55,430
You failed.

615
00:39:55,687 --> 00:39:58,021
I would have. But...

616
00:39:58,768 --> 00:40:01,127
but Alfred, he distracted me.

617
00:40:01,229 --> 00:40:02,752
I know.

618
00:40:04,534 --> 00:40:05,934
I know.

619
00:40:06,059 --> 00:40:08,198
And that's why I'm gonna
give you another chance

620
00:40:08,223 --> 00:40:09,926
to complete your journey.

621
00:40:19,044 --> 00:40:21,144
Oh, don't look so surprised,
Master Bruce.

622
00:40:21,727 --> 00:40:23,797
I told you you couldn't
get rid of me that easy.

623
00:40:23,977 --> 00:40:26,477
Just got a bit sloppy.
Got a bit of ring rust.

624
00:40:26,685 --> 00:40:29,953
Let these little ninja monkeys
get one over on me.

625
00:40:31,968 --> 00:40:33,413
You all right, mate?

626
00:40:33,659 --> 00:40:35,192
What you come as?

627
00:40:43,235 --> 00:40:44,434
Enough.

628
00:40:48,827 --> 00:40:50,240
This man...

629
00:40:50,686 --> 00:40:53,272
is your past, Bruce.

630
00:40:53,912 --> 00:40:56,468
Now, embrace your future.

631
00:41:02,957 --> 00:41:04,371
Kill him.

632
00:41:12,246 --> 00:41:13,830
Join me.

633
00:41:16,335 --> 00:41:18,568
Fulfill your destiny.

634
00:41:25,477 --> 00:41:27,216
He's wrong.

635
00:41:28,514 --> 00:41:30,746
Master Bruce,
there's no other way to put it.

636
00:41:30,771 --> 00:41:31,826
He's wrong.

637
00:41:32,123 --> 00:41:35,864
Your destiny is to be Bruce Wayne.

638
00:41:36,497 --> 00:41:39,606
And one day, you're gonna remember that.

639
00:41:41,544 --> 00:41:44,192
And you're gonna remember
how much I love you.

640
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:50,233
I remember the first time
your mum and dad brought you home.

641
00:41:50,861 --> 00:41:52,416
They were so exhausted.

642
00:41:52,908 --> 00:41:54,822
And they gave you to me.

643
00:41:55,799 --> 00:41:58,963
This tiny, defenseless little creature.

644
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:03,002
And they said, "Look after him,"
and I said, "Sure."

645
00:42:03,057 --> 00:42:05,150
And I scooped you up in my arms,

646
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:08,685
and I held you,
and you opened your eyes...

647
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:13,701
...and you looked at me.

648
00:42:16,428 --> 00:42:19,107
And at that moment, I decided

649
00:42:19,683 --> 00:42:22,316
that I would do anything for you.

650
00:42:22,402 --> 00:42:23,567
Anything.

651
00:42:30,307 --> 00:42:32,572
So, if this is what you need to do,

652
00:42:33,283 --> 00:42:35,494
Master Bruce, you crack on.

653
00:42:38,557 --> 00:42:40,296
You do it.

654
00:43:00,517 --> 00:43:01,731
Join me.

655
00:43:05,203 --> 00:43:06,486
Join me.

656
00:43:09,711 --> 00:43:10,913
Bruce.

657
00:43:17,421 --> 00:43:20,823
Alfred. Alfred!

658
00:43:20,909 --> 00:43:22,087
Alfred!

659
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:23,970
Alfred, no.

660
00:43:28,289 --> 00:43:30,249
Alfred.

661
00:43:38,409 --> 00:43:40,509
You've broken through your conditioning.

662
00:43:42,266 --> 00:43:43,540
Impressive.

663
00:43:44,243 --> 00:43:47,672
You don't control me anymore!

664
00:43:47,852 --> 00:43:50,410
I will never be your heir!

665
00:43:50,535 --> 00:43:51,856
On the contrary.

666
00:43:52,059 --> 00:43:55,777
Your strength only confirms
what the prophecy has foretold.

667
00:43:56,215 --> 00:44:01,759
An heir to serve
as my knight in the darkness.

668
00:44:02,923 --> 00:44:05,100
I will never

669
00:44:05,407 --> 00:44:06,993
follow you!

670
00:44:07,493 --> 00:44:09,738
You made me kill Alfred!

671
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:12,058
Use the waters, Bruce.

672
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:14,576
Our time will come.

673
00:45:03,471 --> 00:45:04,384
Bruce.

674
00:45:04,409 --> 00:45:06,292
Alfred. Alfred. Alfred.

675
00:45:17,041 --> 00:45:19,927
<i>A citywide lockdown
continues to remain in effect,</i>

676
00:45:19,952 --> 00:45:21,866
<i>with Gotham officials urging people</i>

677
00:45:21,944 --> 00:45:25,781
<i>to stay inside their homes, as
thousands of infected citizens</i>

678
00:45:25,816 --> 00:45:27,850
<i>continue their rampage through the city.</i>

679
00:45:27,932 --> 00:45:30,014
<i>Local law enforcement is thus far...</i>

680
00:45:37,895 --> 00:45:39,057
Lee.

681
00:45:39,916 --> 00:45:41,227
Where are you?

682
00:45:42,835 --> 00:45:44,726
Why? You miss me?

683
00:45:45,585 --> 00:45:47,749
- The city's not safe.
<i>- Mm.</i>

684
00:45:48,562 --> 00:45:50,359
Well, that's why I'm packing a bag.

685
00:45:50,546 --> 00:45:52,532
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

686
00:45:52,634 --> 00:45:54,343
I'm leaving Gotham.

687
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:56,545
And I want you to come with me.

688
00:45:58,998 --> 00:46:00,449
<i>I'll take your silence</i>

689
00:46:00,484 --> 00:46:01,474
as a yes?

690
00:46:01,521 --> 00:46:02,684
<i>Lee, you can't leave.</i>

691
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,720
There are checkpoints all over the city.

692
00:46:05,552 --> 00:46:07,189
Who are you trying to convince, Jim?

693
00:46:07,763 --> 00:46:09,958
I can hear it in your voice:
you want this

694
00:46:09,994 --> 00:46:11,449
<i>as much as I do.</i>

695
00:46:11,715 --> 00:46:14,530
<i>We can finally be together,
without judgment</i>

696
00:46:14,863 --> 00:46:17,598
or secrets or jealousy.

697
00:46:18,871 --> 00:46:20,978
<i>After everything we've been through,</i>

698
00:46:21,447 --> 00:46:23,423
don't we deserve that?

699
00:46:31,305 --> 00:46:33,860
I am leaving on the afternoon train.

700
00:46:34,446 --> 00:46:36,318
And I want you with me.

701
00:46:38,322 --> 00:46:39,888
But I want the real you.

702
00:46:41,801 --> 00:46:43,892
<i>So tell me you'll stop fighting it.</i>

703
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:46,769
<i>Tell me I won't lose you again.</i>

704
00:46:48,365 --> 00:46:50,365
Tell me you'll be there.

705
00:46:54,218 --> 00:46:55,704
I'll be there.

706
00:46:59,476 --> 00:47:01,139
Hey, Jim.

707
00:47:01,897 --> 00:47:03,342
Where are we with Tetch?

708
00:47:03,428 --> 00:47:04,834
Barbara and Nygma
gave the mayor's office

709
00:47:04,889 --> 00:47:07,264
a list of demands...
friend snuck me a copy.

710
00:47:07,334 --> 00:47:08,613
They also threatened to kill Tetch

711
00:47:08,637 --> 00:47:10,370
if we tried to take him back by force.

712
00:47:10,488 --> 00:47:12,245
Half of these would bankrupt the city.

713
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:14,527
The alternative being there's
no city left to bankrupt.

714
00:47:14,605 --> 00:47:17,316
We don't have any cards to play,
partner. We got no moves.

715
00:47:19,271 --> 00:47:20,971
Yes, we do.

716
00:47:21,155 --> 00:47:22,121
Him.

717
00:47:22,334 --> 00:47:23,489
Penguin?

718
00:47:23,524 --> 00:47:25,825
This entire list is Barbara's,
except for him.

719
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:27,493
Penguin is the only thing
Nygma cares about.

720
00:47:27,528 --> 00:47:29,462
- The question is: how much?
- No way.

721
00:47:29,561 --> 00:47:31,097
There is no way we're turning him over.

722
00:47:31,186 --> 00:47:32,832
- Why not?
- Because we don't have the authority

723
00:47:32,867 --> 00:47:34,822
to broker some kind of secret
deal behind the city's back.

724
00:47:34,884 --> 00:47:36,736
Much less one that leads to

725
00:47:36,771 --> 00:47:38,904
the imminent death of its former mayor.

726
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,609
Nygma would betray Barbara
and hand over Tetch

727
00:47:40,634 --> 00:47:43,342
if given half the chance.
I need to save Lee!

728
00:47:51,753 --> 00:47:53,705
I don't have much time, Harvey.

729
00:47:54,361 --> 00:47:56,033
It's now or never.

730
00:47:57,825 --> 00:48:01,566
You know, one of these days,
I'm gonna say "never."

731
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:18,938
Hello?

732
00:48:19,003 --> 00:48:21,961
<i>Nygma, it's Gordon.
I'm calling with a proposition.</i>

733
00:48:22,082 --> 00:48:23,394
<i>Can you talk?</i>

734
00:48:28,069 --> 00:48:29,640
I can listen.

735
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:32,391
We need to kill her.

736
00:48:32,765 --> 00:48:35,218
How much longer are we gonna wait?

737
00:48:35,694 --> 00:48:36,962
Come on.

738
00:48:37,252 --> 00:48:39,298
Nygma chopped off your hand.

739
00:48:39,658 --> 00:48:41,167
He almost killed me.

740
00:48:41,275 --> 00:48:42,994
And now Barbara's partners with him?

741
00:48:43,072 --> 00:48:44,570
That's the mother of all insults.

742
00:48:44,605 --> 00:48:47,567
The city is gonna pay us
a lot of money to get Tetch back.

743
00:48:47,653 --> 00:48:50,247
We need to let that play out
before we do anything rash.

744
00:48:50,349 --> 00:48:52,021
I know you two are close.

745
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:56,482
But whatever you had,
she treats you like dirt now.

746
00:48:57,208 --> 00:48:59,614
She treats us both like
dirt, and you know it.

747
00:49:00,588 --> 00:49:02,896
She doesn't deserve your loyalty.

748
00:49:03,282 --> 00:49:05,271
What are you two whispering about?

749
00:49:05,607 --> 00:49:08,208
Nothing. Any word from city hall?

750
00:49:08,294 --> 00:49:10,669
Trust me, we're about to own this town.

751
00:49:10,812 --> 00:49:12,829
Parts of it quite literally.

752
00:49:15,532 --> 00:49:16,992
Where's Ed?

753
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,978
He was just here a minute ago.

754
00:49:23,044 --> 00:49:24,657
Tetch?!

755
00:49:28,191 --> 00:49:30,035
Nygma!

756
00:49:30,684 --> 00:49:32,566
How could you let this happen?

757
00:49:32,684 --> 00:49:34,682
Us? You're the one that trusted him.

758
00:49:34,768 --> 00:49:39,455
I asked you to do one thing:
watch a man tied to a chair!

759
00:49:39,588 --> 00:49:41,660
You idiots can't even do that!

760
00:49:47,104 --> 00:49:48,644
- Where are we going?
- Shut up.

761
00:49:48,715 --> 00:49:50,770
Look, I'm not trying to
aggravate you; it's just this

762
00:49:50,805 --> 00:49:52,844
doesn't exactly have an
above-the-board feeling about it.

763
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:55,040
- What's going on?
- Barbara and Nygma have Tetch.

764
00:49:55,104 --> 00:49:58,167
- They're ransoming the city.
- So what does that have to do with me?

765
00:49:58,643 --> 00:50:00,331
You're handing me over to him.

766
00:50:00,424 --> 00:50:02,517
You can't. You can't.
You cannot do this.

767
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:04,853
It's a small price to pay
for saving the city.

768
00:50:04,878 --> 00:50:07,014
Yeah, for you.
For me, it's a very large price!

769
00:50:07,121 --> 00:50:09,456
Look, he cannot be trusted.

770
00:50:09,481 --> 00:50:11,932
You're risking everything based
on the word of a sociopath.

771
00:50:11,957 --> 00:50:14,488
Yeah, yeah. Get in the car.

772
00:50:14,595 --> 00:50:16,294
What? It's gonna be fine.

773
00:50:16,364 --> 00:50:17,652
Yeah, Penguin, Nygma, Tetch

774
00:50:17,677 --> 00:50:20,003
all in the same place
for a high-stakes hostage swap.

775
00:50:20,035 --> 00:50:21,473
What could possibly go wrong?

776
00:50:31,494 --> 00:50:32,931
Do you mind?

777
00:50:32,991 --> 00:50:35,442
Look, if I'm gonna be the
city's sacrificial lamb,

778
00:50:35,514 --> 00:50:37,022
the least you could do is
lead me to the slaughter

779
00:50:37,047 --> 00:50:38,186
with a little dignity.

780
00:50:38,304 --> 00:50:39,873
No.

781
00:50:40,164 --> 00:50:43,126
You don't think that I can cause
you trouble once we're inside?

782
00:50:43,572 --> 00:50:45,095
You do, and I'll kill you.

783
00:50:45,111 --> 00:50:47,337
No, you won't.
Not before you have Tetch.

784
00:50:47,408 --> 00:50:49,814
Not before the exchange goes smoothly.

785
00:50:49,923 --> 00:50:51,641
And after that,
what do you care what happens?

786
00:50:51,676 --> 00:50:53,242
Let's just get this over with.

787
00:50:54,849 --> 00:50:56,445
- Thank you.
- Shut up.

788
00:51:02,954 --> 00:51:06,048
My three favorite men.

789
00:51:07,126 --> 00:51:09,361
Don't feel bad, Oswald.

790
00:51:09,705 --> 00:51:12,557
Your death at my hands

791
00:51:13,049 --> 00:51:14,744
was inevitable.

792
00:51:15,713 --> 00:51:17,900
Is that what you
told yourself last time?

793
00:51:19,202 --> 00:51:21,468
I'm assuming the grenade's
not a fashion statement.

794
00:51:23,804 --> 00:51:25,341
Precaution.

795
00:51:25,984 --> 00:51:29,249
You three try anything, I pull the pin.

796
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:30,746
Kaboom!

797
00:51:31,158 --> 00:51:32,627
No more Tetch.

798
00:51:32,994 --> 00:51:34,317
No hope for an antidote.

799
00:51:36,409 --> 00:51:39,869
- Little crude, don't you think?
- Enough! Let's get this done.

800
00:51:39,958 --> 00:51:42,025
You're infected.

801
00:51:42,298 --> 00:51:44,327
How wonderful.

802
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:49,728
Nygma!

803
00:51:51,573 --> 00:51:54,292
Did you really think
you could get away with this?

804
00:51:56,019 --> 00:51:57,345
I knew you'd figure out that this was

805
00:51:57,370 --> 00:51:59,206
about Oswald, but how'd you
figure out where we are?

806
00:51:59,277 --> 00:52:02,007
Please. You know how many cops
I got on the payroll?

807
00:52:02,032 --> 00:52:03,512
Oh, baby, you might want to use

808
00:52:03,548 --> 00:52:07,216
your inside growl whilst making
secret calls inside the GCPD.

809
00:52:08,686 --> 00:52:10,453
Now hand him over.

810
00:52:19,216 --> 00:52:20,229
Go!

811
00:52:31,762 --> 00:52:35,832
Let him go! Let him go!
We need to get Tetch!

812
00:52:44,215 --> 00:52:45,481
Now!

813
00:52:55,264 --> 00:52:57,279
That little bastard!

814
00:52:57,966 --> 00:53:00,876
Coming through.
Move out of the way. Rita, move.

815
00:53:04,725 --> 00:53:06,714
All right, let's have a look.

816
00:53:06,844 --> 00:53:08,844
Whoa. What did you do to cauterize this?

817
00:53:09,716 --> 00:53:12,551
I don't, I don't know.
Is he going to be okay?

818
00:53:12,576 --> 00:53:15,865
We'll do everything we can.
What's your relationship to the patient?

819
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:17,936
Doctor, BP's falling.

820
00:53:19,858 --> 00:53:21,412
We're family.

821
00:53:21,514 --> 00:53:23,859
All right, let's get him
tight, cross-set and prepped for OR.

822
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:32,071
It looks pretty good.
I'll call the station.

823
00:53:36,039 --> 00:53:37,905
Grab Tetch!

824
00:53:46,825 --> 00:53:48,424
Split up.

825
00:53:55,692 --> 00:53:57,392
Jim.

826
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:00,396
Jim.

827
00:54:01,785 --> 00:54:04,746
You and the ex are infected, huh?

828
00:54:05,479 --> 00:54:08,994
I've heard Lee wants to remove
my pretty little head

829
00:54:09,143 --> 00:54:10,940
from my body.

830
00:54:11,776 --> 00:54:14,301
Is it weird that kind of
makes me like her?

831
00:54:14,612 --> 00:54:18,325
You thinking about ripping
anyone's head off, Jim?

832
00:54:18,676 --> 00:54:20,416
I bet you are.

833
00:54:21,572 --> 00:54:23,005
You're so close.

834
00:54:23,087 --> 00:54:25,588
The next time you give in,
the virus will have you.

835
00:54:25,623 --> 00:54:26,756
Stop talking.

836
00:54:26,791 --> 00:54:29,036
Jim!

837
00:54:29,552 --> 00:54:31,794
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

838
00:54:32,058 --> 00:54:33,508
Hey.

839
00:54:33,614 --> 00:54:36,011
There's no back door, no loading
dock, no way this ends well.

840
00:54:36,036 --> 00:54:38,849
The virus will give you
all the strength you need.

841
00:54:39,028 --> 00:54:40,536
It's the only option.

842
00:54:40,992 --> 00:54:42,582
Give in to the darkness.

843
00:54:42,626 --> 00:54:43,988
I said...

844
00:54:44,035 --> 00:54:46,617
- <i>Killer.</i>
- stop talking.

845
00:54:46,642 --> 00:54:48,785
You want to kill me, that I can see,

846
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:52,058
but without my blood,
no antidote will there be.

847
00:54:52,105 --> 00:54:54,538
- Fight it, Jim.
- I don't know if I can.

848
00:54:54,983 --> 00:54:57,342
He's right. We need him.

849
00:54:59,913 --> 00:55:02,264
Yeah, but not all of him.

850
00:55:07,579 --> 00:55:09,012
Where are they?!

851
00:55:09,278 --> 00:55:10,322
What happened?!

852
00:55:15,062 --> 00:55:16,628
What'd he do?

853
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:20,604
Oh, Jim.

854
00:55:20,986 --> 00:55:23,174
You sick bastard.

855
00:55:23,970 --> 00:55:25,328
Where's the lab tech?

856
00:55:25,893 --> 00:55:27,172
Where's the lab tech?!

857
00:55:27,307 --> 00:55:28,985
Come on, come on. Here, here.

858
00:55:29,985 --> 00:55:31,105
What?

859
00:55:31,149 --> 00:55:34,235
You've never seen a mason jar
filled with blood before? Go!

860
00:55:34,313 --> 00:55:36,117
Back to work.

861
00:55:36,593 --> 00:55:38,164
You okay?

862
00:55:53,245 --> 00:55:55,533
Oh. Oh.

863
00:55:55,634 --> 00:55:57,728
He's awake.

864
00:55:58,216 --> 00:55:59,845
I was getting lonely.

865
00:56:00,029 --> 00:56:01,128
Where are we?

866
00:56:01,198 --> 00:56:03,558
Oh, we ran into a police blockade.

867
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:05,273
Had to hunker down a minute.

868
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:07,157
Where are you taking me?

869
00:56:08,151 --> 00:56:09,597
I don't know.

870
00:56:09,828 --> 00:56:11,861
I'm sort of improvising here.

871
00:56:12,043 --> 00:56:13,879
Why? You have someplace you have to be?

872
00:56:13,999 --> 00:56:15,319
Does it matter?

873
00:56:16,172 --> 00:56:18,873
I imagine you're planning on
dragging this out.

874
00:56:18,967 --> 00:56:23,844
There are so few moments
of pure joy in one's life,

875
00:56:23,914 --> 00:56:26,782
I feel compelled to savor this one.

876
00:56:26,993 --> 00:56:28,672
You mean gloat?

877
00:56:29,485 --> 00:56:30,880
Yes, I do.

878
00:56:31,547 --> 00:56:34,871
It was always one of your least
attractive qualities, Oswald.

879
00:56:35,605 --> 00:56:37,187
It's killing you, isn't it?

880
00:56:37,378 --> 00:56:38,433
What?

881
00:56:38,496 --> 00:56:42,125
To know that you are not
as smart as you think you are.

882
00:56:42,332 --> 00:56:45,698
All of that planning to drive me crazy,

883
00:56:45,792 --> 00:56:47,393
strip me of everything I had,

884
00:56:47,597 --> 00:56:50,261
revealing yourself with a "ta-da,"

885
00:56:50,358 --> 00:56:51,935
and shooting me by the river.

886
00:56:53,438 --> 00:56:55,593
That plan was perfect...

887
00:56:56,101 --> 00:56:57,467
and you know it.

888
00:56:58,499 --> 00:57:00,171
You failed.

889
00:57:00,765 --> 00:57:02,366
I am still alive,

890
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:05,740
and you are handcuffed in the backseat.

891
00:57:05,884 --> 00:57:10,794
And now you will never be able
to correct your mistake.

892
00:57:12,853 --> 00:57:14,620
I guess not.

893
00:57:17,155 --> 00:57:18,762
Now that they have Tetch's blood,

894
00:57:18,812 --> 00:57:20,764
they can make the antidote;
and after what we tried to pull,

895
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:22,132
the whole city's
gonna be gunning for us.

896
00:57:22,167 --> 00:57:24,467
Hell, I'm surprised the cops
haven't busted down our door already.

897
00:57:24,538 --> 00:57:26,269
Relax. They've got better things to do.

898
00:57:27,192 --> 00:57:28,772
What are we supposed to do now?

899
00:57:28,807 --> 00:57:30,918
We split up, go to the
safe house, and regroup.

900
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:33,109
Regroup? For what?!

901
00:57:33,145 --> 00:57:35,413
For whatever the hell I tell you to do!

902
00:57:39,718 --> 00:57:41,603
I'm not waiting anymore.

903
00:57:41,767 --> 00:57:44,595
She's broken every promise
she's ever made to you...

904
00:57:44,656 --> 00:57:46,166
- to us.
- I know.

905
00:57:46,861 --> 00:57:48,892
Safe house is a perfect place to do it.

906
00:57:50,775 --> 00:57:52,128
Okay.

907
00:57:52,439 --> 00:57:53,922
I'll take care of everything.

908
00:57:53,947 --> 00:57:55,119
No.

909
00:57:56,751 --> 00:57:58,134
We do it together.

910
00:58:03,814 --> 00:58:05,447
Yeah.

911
00:58:17,883 --> 00:58:19,389
Whew.

912
00:58:19,852 --> 00:58:21,935
Kowalski and Burrows
are gonna be pissed.

913
00:58:22,136 --> 00:58:24,214
Uh, Tetch's blood is good.

914
00:58:24,284 --> 00:58:27,088
The lab guys are starting work
on an antidote as we speak.

915
00:58:27,113 --> 00:58:28,704
I need to get to Lee. How long?

916
00:58:28,761 --> 00:58:31,581
- How long before it's ready?
- They said we could head there now.

917
00:58:34,831 --> 00:58:37,324
- Where is it?
- Detective Gordon, just in time.

918
00:58:37,349 --> 00:58:39,123
If you'll take a seat
and roll up your sleeve.

919
00:58:39,373 --> 00:58:40,967
We have a dose ready for you right now.

920
00:58:41,162 --> 00:58:42,612
The others will be ready shortly.

921
00:58:43,011 --> 00:58:44,714
I need two.

922
00:58:44,950 --> 00:58:48,241
Sorry. We could only make one of
these single shots so quickly.

923
00:58:48,266 --> 00:58:49,969
No. Two.

924
00:58:50,032 --> 00:58:51,955
All of Tetch's blood
is in the centrifuge machines.

925
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:53,856
- The process can't be interrupted.
- <i>You're a killer.</i>

926
00:58:53,881 --> 00:58:55,325
It's just one or two hours, max.

927
00:58:55,724 --> 00:58:57,834
You can still catch Lee
before she leaves.

928
00:58:58,498 --> 00:58:59,958
There's not enough time.

929
00:58:59,998 --> 00:59:01,505
Jim.

930
00:59:01,609 --> 00:59:04,068
- <i>Killer!</i>
- Jim. Don't make me... Jim!

931
00:59:04,122 --> 00:59:05,904
No, Jim! Jim!

932
00:59:06,169 --> 00:59:08,304
Damn it! Someone call the bullpen!

933
00:59:22,665 --> 00:59:23,776
Bruce.

934
00:59:25,767 --> 00:59:27,662
I heard about Alfred.

935
00:59:28,810 --> 00:59:30,982
Is he gonna be okay?

936
00:59:33,764 --> 00:59:35,365
Go home, Selina.

937
00:59:35,592 --> 00:59:36,998
What happened?

938
00:59:37,326 --> 00:59:38,621
No.

939
00:59:39,179 --> 00:59:41,123
- No, you don't get to do this.
- Do what?

940
00:59:41,148 --> 00:59:42,702
Walk back into my life.

941
00:59:42,812 --> 00:59:44,644
You think I need your pity? I don't.

942
00:59:44,714 --> 00:59:47,191
- That's not why I'm here.
- You want to know what happened?!

943
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:53,650
- You wouldn't understand.
- Why?

944
00:59:54,217 --> 00:59:56,920
Because I'm-I'm not desperate
to believe in something?

945
00:59:56,955 --> 00:59:59,764
Because you don't believe in
anyone or anything but yourself.

946
01:00:02,194 --> 01:00:03,883
It's called surviving.

947
01:00:04,492 --> 01:00:06,508
And unlike you,

948
01:00:07,266 --> 01:00:09,266
I know who I am.

949
01:00:09,953 --> 01:00:11,774
I don't need anyone to tell me.

950
01:00:12,968 --> 01:00:15,172
What are you even doing here, Selina?

951
01:00:15,344 --> 01:00:16,885
You don't give a damn about Alfred,

952
01:00:16,910 --> 01:00:19,025
and you sure as hell
don't care about me.

953
01:00:21,533 --> 01:00:23,876
I know you better than that.

954
01:00:24,544 --> 01:00:26,329
Yeah.

955
01:00:27,462 --> 01:00:29,293
I thought you did.

956
01:00:32,586 --> 01:00:34,410
Have a nice life.

957
01:00:40,713 --> 01:00:42,408
Lee?

958
01:00:45,963 --> 01:00:48,377
I don't like to be kept waiting.

959
01:00:53,978 --> 01:00:56,048
You're still fighting it.

960
01:00:59,327 --> 01:01:01,327
I can help you with that.

961
01:01:04,098 --> 01:01:05,998
We both know that's not what I want.

962
01:01:07,576 --> 01:01:09,998
I want you.

963
01:01:10,709 --> 01:01:14,146
I want you and all your darkness.

964
01:01:15,237 --> 01:01:16,819
Give in.

965
01:01:18,373 --> 01:01:20,382
Give in to your darkness.

966
01:01:20,407 --> 01:01:22,121
Be free.

967
01:01:51,709 --> 01:01:54,271
Don't you get tired of making
the same mistake over and over?

968
01:01:56,005 --> 01:01:57,593
You think I'm making a mistake?

969
01:01:57,771 --> 01:01:59,788
Instead of killing me
when you had the chance,

970
01:02:00,147 --> 01:02:03,202
you've decided to feed your ego.

971
01:02:03,327 --> 01:02:07,053
You want to talk ego? Riddler?

972
01:02:07,553 --> 01:02:11,066
You will always fail, Oswald.

973
01:02:11,509 --> 01:02:15,641
Because you will always let
your base emotions drive you.

974
01:02:16,087 --> 01:02:17,439
Hate,

975
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:20,977
anger, fear,

976
01:02:22,172 --> 01:02:24,047
- love.
- Shut up.

977
01:02:24,141 --> 01:02:25,280
You want to know why I could never

978
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:27,125
- love someone like you, Oswald?
- I'm warning you.

979
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:30,840
Because you are a spoiled child
who throws a tantrum

980
01:02:30,865 --> 01:02:33,208
any time he doesn't get what he wants!

981
01:02:34,388 --> 01:02:37,459
Especially when what he wants
doesn't want him back.

982
01:02:44,668 --> 01:02:46,919
You're right. I shouldn't have waited.

983
01:02:47,004 --> 01:02:49,732
But, unlike you, I am in the position

984
01:02:49,787 --> 01:02:51,833
to rectify my mistake.

985
01:02:53,482 --> 01:02:57,146
Prepare for one massive tantrum.

986
01:03:07,715 --> 01:03:09,459
No!

987
01:03:09,809 --> 01:03:12,380
That is not possible!

988
01:03:12,563 --> 01:03:15,723
It is my turn!
It is my turn to kill you!

989
01:03:15,777 --> 01:03:17,809
Like I said...

990
01:03:18,473 --> 01:03:22,488
...you will always fail!

991
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:25,114
Because you'll never change.

992
01:03:25,536 --> 01:03:27,129
Maybe.

993
01:03:27,465 --> 01:03:30,176
But at least I know who I am.

994
01:03:30,817 --> 01:03:32,948
That day, by the edge of the river,

995
01:03:32,983 --> 01:03:35,754
that was the moment you were reborn.

996
01:03:35,819 --> 01:03:38,887
And that was a lie!

997
01:03:39,184 --> 01:03:42,791
You're entire persona is based

998
01:03:42,856 --> 01:03:44,372
on a lie!

999
01:03:44,427 --> 01:03:47,708
And there is nothing
you can do to change that!

1000
01:03:50,826 --> 01:03:52,659
Actually...

1001
01:03:53,487 --> 01:03:55,300
maybe there is.

1002
01:03:59,915 --> 01:04:02,842
<i>Attention.
All travelers must pass through</i>

1003
01:04:02,867 --> 01:04:05,186
<i>security checkpoints
before boarding the train.</i>

1004
01:04:05,647 --> 01:04:09,682
<i>Please report anyone who might
be displaying signs of infection</i>

1005
01:04:09,707 --> 01:04:12,668
<i>to the nearest checkpoint
or security officer</i>

1006
01:04:12,777 --> 01:04:14,371
<i>so that immediate medical assistance...</i>

1007
01:04:14,433 --> 01:04:16,574
Hey, this isn't a public entrance.

1008
01:04:16,941 --> 01:04:18,816
Oh, crap.

1009
01:04:28,021 --> 01:04:29,880
Police! Move it! Police!

1010
01:04:30,029 --> 01:04:31,631
Move aside! Police!

1011
01:04:31,733 --> 01:04:34,743
Move, move! Get out of my way!

1012
01:04:35,035 --> 01:04:37,176
He's trying to stop us.

1013
01:04:37,614 --> 01:04:39,696
You can't let him.

1014
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,454
I'll see you on the train.

1015
01:04:41,672 --> 01:04:43,218
Police! Police! Move!

1016
01:04:43,711 --> 01:04:46,243
Out of the way! Move! Jim!

1017
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:47,688
Jim!

1018
01:04:50,722 --> 01:04:52,683
Now we're gonna be delayed, aren't we?

1019
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:55,652
You gonna shoot me, Harvey?

1020
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:58,433
This isn't you!

1021
01:04:58,736 --> 01:05:00,054
It is.

1022
01:05:00,194 --> 01:05:01,874
Please don't make me do this.

1023
01:05:05,382 --> 01:05:07,315
Lee and I belong together.

1024
01:05:07,458 --> 01:05:09,192
I know.

1025
01:05:09,349 --> 01:05:10,986
I know how bad you want that,

1026
01:05:11,317 --> 01:05:13,789
to forget about everything
that happened, but you can't.

1027
01:05:13,824 --> 01:05:14,956
It's not real.

1028
01:05:20,550 --> 01:05:22,378
This is who I am!

1029
01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:27,816
- This is who I've always been.
- No, it's not!

1030
01:05:28,285 --> 01:05:30,276
Who you are is a choice.

1031
01:05:30,909 --> 01:05:33,456
It always has been. It still is.

1032
01:05:34,978 --> 01:05:36,611
This is who you are.

1033
01:05:38,306 --> 01:05:40,382
You're the best cop I ever worked with.

1034
01:05:41,751 --> 01:05:43,860
The best friend I've ever had.

1035
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:46,972
If you love Lee,

1036
01:05:48,136 --> 01:05:49,524
go save her.

1037
01:05:58,462 --> 01:06:00,150
Tickets.

1038
01:06:05,509 --> 01:06:07,090
Tickets.

1039
01:06:11,415 --> 01:06:13,207
To our great adventure.

1040
01:06:16,352 --> 01:06:18,018
Tickets.

1041
01:06:50,254 --> 01:06:52,034
I love you, Lee.

1042
01:07:01,764 --> 01:07:04,538
No.

1043
01:07:06,882 --> 01:07:08,015
No.

1044
01:07:09,539 --> 01:07:11,250
What have you done?

1045
01:07:55,408 --> 01:07:56,674
Really?

1046
01:07:56,834 --> 01:07:58,386
A hacksaw?

1047
01:07:58,450 --> 01:08:01,318
Even your disposal tactics are idiotic.

1048
01:08:01,447 --> 01:08:03,617
Guess I'm just old-fashioned.

1049
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:06,726
Did you really think I
wouldn't figure it out?

1050
01:08:06,986 --> 01:08:08,453
The two of you have been whispering

1051
01:08:08,478 --> 01:08:10,278
like teenagers for weeks.

1052
01:08:10,937 --> 01:08:12,710
Oh, Butchie.

1053
01:08:13,006 --> 01:08:15,345
You shouldn't have waited.

1054
01:08:15,455 --> 01:08:18,220
Well, believe me,
if it weren't for Tabby,

1055
01:08:18,424 --> 01:08:20,537
you'd have been dead a long time ago.

1056
01:08:20,665 --> 01:08:23,741
You're trying to tell me
she had nothing to do with this?

1057
01:08:24,181 --> 01:08:26,043
- That's right.
- Oh, so you've just

1058
01:08:26,165 --> 01:08:27,811
gone behind her back, have you?

1059
01:08:28,430 --> 01:08:30,681
I was gonna hit you
before we got to the safe house.

1060
01:08:30,993 --> 01:08:32,149
Play dumb when you didn't show.

1061
01:08:32,242 --> 01:08:33,817
Leaning into your strengths?

1062
01:08:33,898 --> 01:08:35,961
You want to know why you're
always taking shots at me?

1063
01:08:36,055 --> 01:08:38,101
The giant size of the target?

1064
01:08:39,226 --> 01:08:41,780
It's because for all your tough talk,

1065
01:08:42,226 --> 01:08:43,827
you miss her.

1066
01:08:44,639 --> 01:08:47,319
You miss her loyalty, her strength.

1067
01:08:47,566 --> 01:08:49,231
She made you better, and you know it.

1068
01:08:49,942 --> 01:08:52,012
And you sacrificed that, for what?

1069
01:08:52,590 --> 01:08:54,325
Play queen for a day?

1070
01:08:55,285 --> 01:08:56,770
Pathetic.

1071
01:08:57,770 --> 01:08:59,209
If it helps...

1072
01:09:00,646 --> 01:09:02,311
...you never deserved her
in the first...

1073
01:09:10,148 --> 01:09:12,132
I guess we'll see.

1074
01:09:19,996 --> 01:09:22,182
I-I don't know if you can hear me.

1075
01:09:24,658 --> 01:09:26,826
But if you can,

1076
01:09:28,373 --> 01:09:30,397
Alfred, you need to fight.

1077
01:09:33,295 --> 01:09:35,225
I don't know what I would do
without you.

1078
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:40,031
Alfred, please.

1079
01:09:41,140 --> 01:09:43,445
Please don't leave me.

1080
01:10:13,690 --> 01:10:14,922
Here we are.

1081
01:10:15,416 --> 01:10:17,003
Again.

1082
01:10:19,125 --> 01:10:20,627
Wow.

1083
01:10:21,166 --> 01:10:23,471
I have to tell you,

1084
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:27,299
this feels really great.

1085
01:10:28,213 --> 01:10:30,269
Glad I could help.

1086
01:10:32,505 --> 01:10:34,300
Any last words?

1087
01:10:36,066 --> 01:10:37,996
I'm fine for now.

1088
01:10:39,388 --> 01:10:41,105
I beg your pardon?

1089
01:10:41,909 --> 01:10:43,300
I'll wait.

1090
01:10:44,058 --> 01:10:46,358
I'm going to kill you, Oswald.

1091
01:10:46,667 --> 01:10:48,213
There is no later.

1092
01:10:48,260 --> 01:10:50,604
If you have something to say...

1093
01:10:51,323 --> 01:10:53,190
now is the time.

1094
01:10:53,526 --> 01:10:55,155
Duly noted.

1095
01:10:55,494 --> 01:10:56,883
Oh, whatever.

1096
01:10:57,047 --> 01:10:58,797
I'm not letting you ruin this for me.

1097
01:10:58,961 --> 01:11:01,203
You don't have anything to say,

1098
01:11:02,102 --> 01:11:03,704
but I do.

1099
01:11:04,789 --> 01:11:07,648
Good-bye, Oswald.

1100
01:11:19,385 --> 01:11:20,818
I removed the bullets

1101
01:11:20,853 --> 01:11:22,857
when you were knocked out.

1102
01:11:22,955 --> 01:11:24,688
Right before I called them.

1103
01:11:35,662 --> 01:11:37,600
In the backseat,

1104
01:11:38,295 --> 01:11:40,420
the pin I used to unlock my cuffs?

1105
01:11:40,573 --> 01:11:41,983
My tiepin.

1106
01:11:42,319 --> 01:11:44,045
I thought it should be personal.

1107
01:11:44,243 --> 01:11:46,841
You were just trying to make me
think I had the upper hand.

1108
01:11:47,841 --> 01:11:49,974
It all fell into place.

1109
01:11:50,316 --> 01:11:52,701
How did you know that Barbara
would show up at the warehouse?

1110
01:11:53,435 --> 01:11:54,974
I didn't.

1111
01:11:55,397 --> 01:11:57,214
If it wasn't for her,

1112
01:11:57,426 --> 01:12:00,057
Gordon would have turned me over,
and I'd most likely be dead.

1113
01:12:02,668 --> 01:12:04,926
But fortune favors the bold.

1114
01:12:07,733 --> 01:12:10,871
You said you called them
after you knocked me out.

1115
01:12:15,236 --> 01:12:17,522
You knew that I'd bring you here.

1116
01:12:19,144 --> 01:12:21,491
I know you, Ed.

1117
01:12:22,529 --> 01:12:25,097
I may be driven by my emotions,

1118
01:12:25,233 --> 01:12:29,058
but you are driven by something
much more predictable:

1119
01:12:29,886 --> 01:12:31,972
a desperate, compulsive need

1120
01:12:32,042 --> 01:12:35,574
to complete what you've started
in exacting fashion.

1121
01:12:36,558 --> 01:12:38,866
Why didn't you just kill me, Oswald?

1122
01:12:41,393 --> 01:12:44,134
You were the one time
I let love weaken me,

1123
01:12:44,954 --> 01:12:47,971
and I want you around
as a constant reminder

1124
01:12:48,313 --> 01:12:50,524
to never make that mistake again.

1125
01:13:00,265 --> 01:13:01,618
No...

1126
01:13:14,366 --> 01:13:15,916
Barbara?

1127
01:13:18,504 --> 01:13:19,853
Butch?

1128
01:13:21,283 --> 01:13:22,634
Butch?

1129
01:13:49,864 --> 01:13:53,043
Was killing Nygma... really

1130
01:13:53,926 --> 01:13:55,465
that important to you?

1131
01:13:58,711 --> 01:14:00,488
Did you kill Butch?

1132
01:14:01,410 --> 01:14:03,606
He said you didn't have anything to do

1133
01:14:03,707 --> 01:14:05,738
with him trying to kill me.

1134
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:08,185
Is that true?

1135
01:14:09,983 --> 01:14:11,562
What does it matter?

1136
01:14:12,996 --> 01:14:15,210
All right, for argument's sake,

1137
01:14:15,728 --> 01:14:20,197
let's say I haven't
been the best friend.

1138
01:14:21,115 --> 01:14:23,633
Do you think we could put this behind us

1139
01:14:23,786 --> 01:14:25,771
and move forward?

1140
01:14:28,567 --> 01:14:30,003
Did you kill Butch?

1141
01:14:30,128 --> 01:14:32,151
That doesn't sound like a "yes."

1142
01:14:32,299 --> 01:14:33,598
I need to know.

1143
01:14:34,128 --> 01:14:36,433
It's the only way
we'll be able to move forward.

1144
01:14:40,052 --> 01:14:41,287
Yes.

1145
01:14:42,545 --> 01:14:44,029
I killed him.

1146
01:14:44,757 --> 01:14:47,624
But it's not like you gave me a choice!

1147
01:14:49,579 --> 01:14:51,579
There's always a choice.

1148
01:15:44,183 --> 01:15:46,423
How many times have I
told you not to bring

1149
01:15:46,486 --> 01:15:48,541
a whip to a gunfight?

1150
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:06,013
Now we can move forward.

1151
01:16:11,085 --> 01:16:12,747
<i>The Tetch antidote has been released</i>

1152
01:16:12,772 --> 01:16:15,686
<i>over the city with a 90% cure rate,</i>

1153
01:16:15,763 --> 01:16:18,557
<i>with individual antidotes
now being manufactured</i>

1154
01:16:18,611 --> 01:16:21,479
<i>and given to GCPD officers...</i>

1155
01:16:21,849 --> 01:16:23,391
You're awake!

1156
01:16:30,968 --> 01:16:32,824
I'm sorry, Alfred.

1157
01:16:34,795 --> 01:16:37,061
It wasn't your fault, was it?

1158
01:16:39,733 --> 01:16:41,974
I completely lost my way.

1159
01:16:42,763 --> 01:16:45,466
I've been trying to find
who I am for so long,

1160
01:16:45,552 --> 01:16:47,802
searching for some greater meaning.

1161
01:16:49,202 --> 01:16:51,810
I don't know who I am, Alfred.

1162
01:16:54,281 --> 01:16:56,448
Who am I supposed to be?

1163
01:16:59,205 --> 01:17:01,424
I can't help you with that one, mate.

1164
01:17:02,721 --> 01:17:04,456
You're a man now.

1165
01:17:06,727 --> 01:17:09,238
You got to find your own path.

1166
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:12,293
I'm not like you.

1167
01:17:13,215 --> 01:17:15,520
You've always been
so sure of who you are.

1168
01:17:15,818 --> 01:17:18,091
Oh, I don't know about that.

1169
01:17:19,018 --> 01:17:21,925
I've been through some very dark places,

1170
01:17:22,354 --> 01:17:24,011
as have you.

1171
01:17:27,386 --> 01:17:30,169
You need to find your true north

1172
01:17:30,990 --> 01:17:32,884
and let that guide you.

1173
01:17:35,662 --> 01:17:37,044
What's yours?

1174
01:17:38,904 --> 01:17:40,726
You.

1175
01:17:43,865 --> 01:17:45,330
It's always been you.

1176
01:17:47,034 --> 01:17:51,041
You got to find something
that you really care about...

1177
01:17:52,346 --> 01:17:54,906
and you protect it at all costs.

1178
01:17:56,421 --> 01:17:58,421
And when you find it...

1179
01:18:01,371 --> 01:18:03,528
...you'll never be lost again.

1180
01:18:11,409 --> 01:18:13,432
<i>And while the arrival of an antidote</i>

1181
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:15,160
<i>is certainly welcome news,</i>

1182
01:18:15,195 --> 01:18:17,829
<i>the death and the destruction
the virus left in its wake</i>

1183
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:21,433
<i>will no doubt reverberate through
the city for years to come.</i>

1184
01:18:31,993 --> 01:18:33,555
Yeah?

1185
01:18:34,047 --> 01:18:35,571
Is Barbara around?

1186
01:18:36,579 --> 01:18:38,280
No.

1187
01:18:38,733 --> 01:18:40,491
And she's not coming back.

1188
01:18:41,444 --> 01:18:43,178
What do you want?

1189
01:18:44,045 --> 01:18:45,724
I'm not sure.

1190
01:18:46,301 --> 01:18:48,286
I just know I'm tired of

1191
01:18:48,398 --> 01:18:50,075
just surviving.

1192
01:18:50,965 --> 01:18:52,653
I want more.

1193
01:18:52,973 --> 01:18:55,052
I want to move up.

1194
01:18:56,951 --> 01:18:59,068
Figured this was a good place to start.

1195
01:19:02,443 --> 01:19:05,001
I'm at a bit of a crossroads myself.

1196
01:19:05,946 --> 01:19:07,412
You hungry?

1197
01:19:09,399 --> 01:19:10,649
You buying?

1198
01:19:18,286 --> 01:19:19,758
Give it a whirl.

1199
01:19:44,785 --> 01:19:47,496
That is the logo for my new club.

1200
01:19:48,074 --> 01:19:49,902
What are we gonna call it?

1201
01:19:50,491 --> 01:19:52,308
The Iceberg Lounge.

1202
01:19:52,613 --> 01:19:54,993
Clever. 'Cause you're
nicknamed Penguin, right?

1203
01:19:55,387 --> 01:19:57,269
There's that.

1204
01:19:57,823 --> 01:19:59,484
And then...

1205
01:19:59,742 --> 01:20:04,002
there's the club's
centerpiece attraction.

1206
01:20:15,689 --> 01:20:17,089
Lee?

1207
01:20:18,684 --> 01:20:20,317
Lee?

1208
01:20:35,985 --> 01:20:37,615
<i>Jim...</i>

1209
01:20:37,838 --> 01:20:41,209
<i>I knew if I saw you, I might
not have the courage to leave.</i>

1210
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:43,273
<i>And I need to.</i>

1211
01:20:44,030 --> 01:20:45,632
<i>I finally understand Gotham</i>

1212
01:20:45,695 --> 01:20:48,543
<i>in a way I suspect you always have.</i>

1213
01:20:49,621 --> 01:20:53,184
<i>It's a place where the strongest
and most cunning rule...</i>

1214
01:20:55,222 --> 01:20:59,177
<i>...where the cost of survival
is paid for by others...</i>

1215
01:21:01,646 --> 01:21:03,929
<i>...and everyone feels alone.</i>

1216
01:21:05,966 --> 01:21:09,019
<i>Having the virus showed me
the city as it truly was.</i>

1217
01:21:09,722 --> 01:21:12,121
<i>As I truly was.</i>

1218
01:21:12,865 --> 01:21:17,367
<i>In so many ways,
the virus made me feel reborn.</i>

1219
01:21:17,506 --> 01:21:19,444
He's a gangster; probably
got what he deserved.

1220
01:21:19,469 --> 01:21:21,625
- He is?
- Sure. That's Butch Gilzean.

1221
01:21:21,696 --> 01:21:25,900
Really? His chart lists
his birth name as Cyrus Gold.

1222
01:21:25,993 --> 01:21:27,181
Cyrus Gold?

1223
01:21:27,282 --> 01:21:29,337
He must have changed it at some point.

1224
01:21:29,876 --> 01:21:31,299
<i>But if having the virus</i>

1225
01:21:31,358 --> 01:21:34,231
<i>allowed Gotham to embrace
its worst self,</i>

1226
01:21:34,754 --> 01:21:37,981
<i>the cure should remind us
there is always hope.</i>

1227
01:21:38,794 --> 01:21:41,379
<i>A chance to remember who we can be</i>

1228
01:21:41,871 --> 01:21:43,754
<i>rather than who we are.</i>

1229
01:21:45,806 --> 01:21:47,902
<i>I don't know if Gotham deserves saving,</i>

1230
01:21:47,980 --> 01:21:49,862
<i>but I do know one thing.</i>

1231
01:21:50,378 --> 01:21:52,550
<i>If anyone can save it...</i>

1232
01:21:53,194 --> 01:21:54,882
<i>it's you.</i>

1233
01:21:55,616 --> 01:22:00,116
<i>And in return, I believe
it can save you as well.</i>

1234
01:22:01,595 --> 01:22:04,010
<i>And then maybe one day,</i>

1235
01:22:04,791 --> 01:22:06,830
<i>it will send you back to me.</i>

1236
01:22:08,362 --> 01:22:09,831
<i>Until then,</i>

1237
01:22:11,083 --> 01:22:12,966
<i>love always...</i>

1238
01:22:14,060 --> 01:22:15,482
<i>Lee.</i>

1239
01:22:30,050 --> 01:22:31,720
Can I come in, Captain?

1240
01:22:32,095 --> 01:22:33,284
No.

1241
01:22:34,689 --> 01:22:36,521
You threw me against a train car.

1242
01:22:37,033 --> 01:22:39,982
- I know.
- Two... actually.

1243
01:22:40,007 --> 01:22:41,554
I felt like a freaking cartoon.

1244
01:22:41,663 --> 01:22:43,601
I am really sorry about that.

1245
01:22:45,499 --> 01:22:46,959
You see Lee?

1246
01:22:48,303 --> 01:22:49,698
She's gone.

1247
01:22:49,873 --> 01:22:51,269
She left Gotham.

1248
01:22:51,889 --> 01:22:53,171
You okay?

1249
01:22:55,311 --> 01:22:57,014
I will be.

1250
01:22:58,454 --> 01:23:00,979
- You want to get a drink?
- It's noon.

1251
01:23:01,014 --> 01:23:04,415
I didn't ask you what time it was.
I asked if you wanted to get a drink.

1252
01:23:04,509 --> 01:23:06,071
Sure.

1253
01:23:06,853 --> 01:23:08,235
I'm good.

1254
01:23:08,727 --> 01:23:10,282
Any word on Tetch?

1255
01:23:10,367 --> 01:23:11,976
Yeah, he stumbled into some hospital.

1256
01:23:12,059 --> 01:23:15,178
They patched him up,
shipped him back to Arkham.

1257
01:23:15,459 --> 01:23:18,295
You know, I'd actually like to
get back to being a detective.

1258
01:23:18,584 --> 01:23:20,514
Do some good old-fashioned police work.

1259
01:23:20,607 --> 01:23:23,886
The kind that doesn't involve
secret cults or blood viruses.

1260
01:23:23,972 --> 01:23:25,902
- Do we have anything like that?
- Not really.

1261
01:23:25,995 --> 01:23:27,939
Half the force is coming off
24-hour shifts,

1262
01:23:27,974 --> 01:23:30,317
but we could, uh... hit the streets

1263
01:23:30,342 --> 01:23:32,169
like a couple of old beat cops,

1264
01:23:32,194 --> 01:23:33,878
see if we could stir up
some trouble, huh?

1265
01:23:34,326 --> 01:23:36,787
I don't know, seems kind of beneath me.

1266
01:23:37,678 --> 01:23:39,416
You know, seeing as I'm the...

1267
01:23:39,764 --> 01:23:41,861
best cop you've
ever worked with and all.

1268
01:23:41,916 --> 01:23:44,588
Oh, oh, I was just telling you
whatever crap came to mind

1269
01:23:44,658 --> 01:23:46,026
so you wouldn't punch a hole
through my head.

1270
01:23:46,050 --> 01:23:46,954
Uh-huh.

1271
01:23:46,979 --> 01:23:48,751
Like a hostage negotiation,
you just tell someone

1272
01:23:48,762 --> 01:23:50,621
- what they want to hear.
- Sure, sure.

1273
01:23:50,699 --> 01:23:52,221
If you didn't have the virus,

1274
01:23:52,246 --> 01:23:53,732
- I would've kicked your butt.
- Is that right?

1275
01:23:53,767 --> 01:23:55,300
Yeah, absolutely.

1276
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:01,821
It was so good.

1277
01:24:01,875 --> 01:24:03,274
That was such a good dinner.

1278
01:24:03,310 --> 01:24:05,076
I never ever had sushi like that.

1279
01:24:05,868 --> 01:24:07,579
It was great, whatever it was.

1280
01:24:08,815 --> 01:24:10,148
Money!

1281
01:24:10,183 --> 01:24:11,249
- Now!
- Dad?

1282
01:24:11,284 --> 01:24:12,951
- It's-it's okay, sweetheart.
- Now!

1283
01:24:15,918 --> 01:24:17,382
No!

1284
01:24:17,859 --> 01:24:19,491
- Dad!
- No!
