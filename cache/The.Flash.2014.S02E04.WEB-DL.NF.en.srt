to re-engineer Dr. Wells' original
stabilizer to quell the reaction,

Okay, go. I'll cover you with Singh.

All right. Thanks.

MARTIN: Well, I must admit,
I never imagined

162
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:23,192
a Sphinx's riddle about a man requiring
three legs would ever apply to me,

163
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,279
but if this device keeps me mobile,
then I will gratefully oblige.

164
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:30,199
Well, hopefully you won't need it
for much longer.

165
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,076
There was no agglutination
in the blood samples,

166
00:07:32,284 --> 00:07:33,995
and cross-matching was negative for both.

167
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:37,289
And it appears that the dark matter
from the Particle Accelerator explosion

168
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:40,502
mutated their genes
in a very similar way it did to yours.

169

-I think they're both potential matches.
-So, who do we go with?

170
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,215
Well, my first choice is Henry Hewitt.

171
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,260
He graduated summa cum laude
from Hudson University,

172
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,138
with a double major
in Applied Physics and Bioengineering.

173
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:53,890
A Hudson boy. I like him already.

174
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:56,350
Now, what about this other guy?
Jefferson Jackson?

175
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:58,936
High School quarterback. 4.0 student.

176
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,397
He's got the physical attributes.

177
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,776
And it looks like more of his alleles
match than Hewitt's.

178
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,361
Doesn't that mean
that he's more compatible?

179
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,573
On paper, perhaps.
But Hewitt is a scientist.

180
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:13,034
Clearly, he's trying
to make something of his life.

181
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:15,369
I think he'd be open
to something like this.

182
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,997
I think we should meet with both of them
before we make a decision.

183
00:08:18,205 --> 00:08:20,708
-That's an excellent idea.
-I'll see if I can get Hewitt here.

184
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,085
All right. In the meantime,
we'll go meet with Jefferson Jackson.

185
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:27,006

to help keep you stable.

00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,421
Remind me to call Richard tomorrow
about the shareholders meeting.

312
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,091
And where are we with the replacement
for Dr. Snow?

313
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,051
-We...
-(ALARM BLARING)

314
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:29,428
Applied sciences?

315
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,274
Stop! Don't move!

316
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,363
Harrison?

317
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:53,202
DR. McGEE: <i>Detective West.
Thank you for coming.</i>

318
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,787
Dr. McGee, this is my new partner,
Detective Spivot.

319
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,289
It's nice to meet you.

320
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,458
I was saddened
by Detective Thawne's passing.

321
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,752
Please extend my condolences
to your daughter.

322
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:02,962
Thank you.

323
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:06,048
On the phone you mentioned
this was a sensitive matter.

324
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:07,591
It is. And I called you directly

325
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:11,095
because I've always appreciated
your discretion in the past.

326
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,305
Of course.
Can you tell me what was stolen?

327
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,100
It's not so much what was stolen,
but who stole it.

328
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,602
The person who broke into
my facility last night

329
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,771
was Harrison Wells.

330
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,150
Harrison Wells is dead.

331
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:26,152
I seem to recall the circumstances

332
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,320
around his passing
were a bit inconclusive.

333
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,614
Is there any possibility
he could be alive?

334
00:16:30,822 --> 00:16:32,074
Zero possibility.

335
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,825
I knew the man for over 20 years.

336
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,661
I know who I saw.

337
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,997
The only thing distinctively different was

338
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,499
he's walking again.

339
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:44,920
Like I said, I trust your discretion.

340
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,339
You have full access to the facility.

341
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,508
Thank you again, Detective.

342
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:55,681
First a shark-man, now a dead man walking.

343
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,351
We need to call Barry,
get him in here first.

344
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:02,021
Barry can't hear about any of this.

345
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,273
What? Why?

346
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:05,524
Because he's got a lot on his plate.

347
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,193
He's got a friend who's sick,
who needs his help.

348
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,945
And Harrison Wells is the man
who murdered his mother.

349
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,947
Once he hears that...

350
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:14,533
-Is he okay?
-He's fine,

351
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:17,536
but not a word to him, or anyone. Okay?

352
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,038
Okay.

353
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:20,706
Yeah, it's just...

354
00:17:20,997 --> 00:17:23,042
I'm not really good at lying.
(CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY)

355
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,044
Well, you better learn. Quick.

356
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,713
Yeah, definitely.

357
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,558
-Spivot, go on ahead.
-Sure.

358
00:17:40,892 --> 00:17:43,979
This is the last time you ever
show up here. Do you understand?

359
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,231
I needed to talk to you again.

360
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,899
How much clearer do we need to be?

361
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:50,236
Iris and I do not want you in our lives.

362
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,071
Leave. Please.

363
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,865
Go home, live your life.

364
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,159
Joe, there's something else.

365
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,245
I wanted to tell you
when I first saw you, but...

366
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,871
What is it?

367
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,751
A few months ago,

368
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,753
I started getting weak.

369
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,714
The doctors ran a bunch of tests,
they couldn't figure it out.

370
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,093
But finally, they did.

371
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,263
Said I have something called MacGregor's.

372
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,767
Supposedly, it's pretty common
among ex-addicts.

373
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:27,106
Told me I had till the end of the year,
if I'm lucky.

374
00:18:29,065 --> 00:18:31,610
Is... Is that why you came back?

375
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:34,405
I just want my daughter to know me.

376
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:36,740
This me.

377
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,626
BARRY: <i>I'm really glad
you decided to come.</i>

378
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,296
I thought S.T.A.R. Labs had to shut down.

379
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,214
BARRY: It's under new management.

380
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,467
Whoa, what kind of treadmill is that?

381
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:56,968
Cosmic.

382
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:58,970
JEFFERSON: Cool.

383
00:18:59,971 --> 00:19:01,723
So, let's get started.

384
00:19:02,098 --> 00:19:05,269
You got some kind of Billion-Dollar-Man
technology that's gonna fix my knee?

385
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,480
Actually, Jax,
this isn't about fixing your knee.

386
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,106
What are you talking about?

387
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,234
When the Particle Accelerator exploded,

388
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:16,322
the energy wave that collided with you
is known as dark matter.

389
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,907
And, it didn't just hurt your knee.

390
00:19:19,115 --> 00:19:22,661
It changed the molecular structure
of your body.

391
00:19:22,994 --> 00:19:24,079
Whoa, hold on, Grey.

392
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,956
So, you're saying I'm like
one of those meta-humans

393
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,791
I keep hearing about on the news?

394
00:19:27,999 --> 00:19:30,961
Yes, I am. Please, call me Professor.

395
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,464
We think you have potential capabilities.

396
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:34,965
What kind of capabilities?

397
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,593
The same as Professor Stein.

398
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:41,347
The ability for your body
to process fission and fusion.

399
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,640
And you can harness excess energy

400
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,185
and turn it into these
massive nuclear blasts.

401
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:49,020
And you can fly. There's also that.

402
00:19:50,146 --> 00:19:51,773
So you're saying you can do all this?

403
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:56,027
Only during times of convergence
with a willing partner.

404
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,822
Convergence? You and me?

405
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,282
Yes.

406
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,953
(LAUGHING) No. This is crazy.

407
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,457
Jax, this is your chance to right
the wrong that was done to you.

408
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:10,376
Yeah. Sorry, you got the wrong guy.

409
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:11,793
I don't want nothing to do with this.

410
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:14,880
Wait a second. We are giving you
the chance to be a superhero,

411
00:20:15,046 --> 00:20:16,298
and you're going to say no that quickly?

412
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:17,674
Yeah. Not my kind of thing.

413
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,469
If the man isn't willing to participate...

414
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,471
Look, I saw your test scores, Jax.

415
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:25,891
Your grades were good enough
to get into college, but you didn't go.

416
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,393
<i>Why?</i>

417
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,020
Is this the type of guy you are?
One setback and you fold?

418
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,855
Well then, maybe you're not
the guy for us anyway.

419
00:20:32,063 --> 00:20:33,064
Well, maybe I'm not.

420
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,525
Jack...

421
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,903
Maybe, this just wasn't meant to be.

422
00:20:43,074 --> 00:20:44,576
Caitlin, what do you... I mean,

423
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:47,913
Jax could be our last chance
at saving Professor Stein.

424
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:51,207
He said "no" to being a superhero.
Who does that?

425
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,043
I mean, you didn't say no
when you had the chance.

426
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,837
-Cisco, would you?
-Chance to have superpowers?

427
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,088
Sign me up.

428
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,883
Look, we're asking Jax
to change his entire life.

429
00:21:00,091 --> 00:21:01,843
To sacrifice what he does have.

430
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:04,763
I mean, that's not a decision
that can be made lightly.

431
00:21:05,096 --> 00:21:08,850
It took me a long time
to figure out this whole hero thing.

432
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:12,228
Exactly. Which is why we need someone
who wants to do this.

433
00:21:14,105 --> 00:21:15,607
-Where are you going?
-To get Hewitt back.

434
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:17,443
We have to try again.

435
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:26,785
Human DNA?

436
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,288
Yep. Definitely not a man-shark.

437
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:30,789
Not even a land shark, ma'am.

438
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,583
Well, thanks for testing it for me.

439
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,418
Yeah. What are you gonna do now?

440
00:21:35,126 --> 00:21:36,920
I don't know. Probably file it
under never-gonna-happen.

441
00:21:37,128 --> 00:21:38,464
-I have another case, anyway.
-Oh.

442
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,923
Anything I can help you with?

443
00:21:40,256 --> 00:21:42,634
No. No, no, no.
Detective said definitely not.

444
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,929
-Is everything all good?
-Sure. Why?

445
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,264
I don't know.
You're just acting kind of different.

446
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:49,475
No!

447
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:52,644
No, I'm the same old P. Spivot.

448
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:54,145
<i>You know?</i>

449
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,398
What... Actually, I have to go.

450
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:59,985
But thank you so much for testing this.
And I'll see you.

451
00:22:00,151 --> 00:22:01,445
Okay. I...

452
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,080
BARRY: Yo, Joe.

453
00:22:13,289 --> 00:22:14,541
Hey.

454
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,753
You good? Everything all right?

455
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:20,506
Yeah. I don't know.

456
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:22,883
-I just had a hell of a day.
-Yeah?

457
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:27,178
(SIGHS) Iris' mother.

458
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,098
She told me she was dying.

459
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,935
Yeah. And I know Francine.

460
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:36,397
She's telling the truth about this.

461
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:37,981
Okay.

462
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,442
Does Iris know?

463
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,235
Not yet.

464
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:46,532
Did... Did you need something?

465
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,200
Uh, no. Nah, I just...

466
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:54,080
Patty said that you don't want me on
some case that she's on with you.

467
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:55,874
No.

468
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,544
I was checking out a lead.
I'll let you know.

469
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,046
All right. Cool.

-Come on. I...
-Barr,

472
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,053
you can't take your eyes off that girl.

473
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,806
I don't know what you want me to tell you.

474
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,265
I mean, she's great, you know.

475
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:16,978
She's adorable and funny,
and we have a lot in common. But...

476
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:18,605
But, um...

477
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,652
I don't know. She's not Iris, I guess.

478
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,153
Right.

479
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:28,406
You've known Iris since you were 10,

480
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,786
you've been in love with her
since forever.

481
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,789
I mean, you two are friends now,

482
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,083
but she was your first love.

Yeah. He's gonna pop his top.

It appears Mr. Hewitt's stability

520

Professor Stein is getting worse.

523

And Hewitt's like this because of me.

And now, Jefferson Jackson will never
come back because of what I said.

This isn't because
you didn't believe in him.

527
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,726
Sometimes, great possibilities
are right in front of us,

528
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:03,186
and we don't see them
because we choose not to.

529

I think that we need to be open

She's dying?

A few months left.

532
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:26,292
I just don't think I can see her, Dad.

533
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:27,961
And that's fine.

534
00:26:28,294 --> 00:26:29,337
But

535
00:26:29,545 --> 00:26:31,798
you and me need to be
crystal clear about this, Iris.

536
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:35,093
If you want to have a relationship
with Francine, it's okay with me.

537
00:26:35,301 --> 00:26:36,386
You don't have to protect me.

538

I'm a grown man, and I've dealt
with these feelings a long time ago.

So, you... You just believe her?

540
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:49,315
She's done some bad things in her life,
but she wouldn't lie about this.

541
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:51,902
Dad, she shows up out of nowhere,

542
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:55,363
and she only says that she's dying
after I told her to stay away?

543
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:59,159
Look, she didn't come to Central City
to see me.

544
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:00,661
She came because of you.

545

I just wanted you to know everything

546

so you can make
the best decision for yourself.

547

My husband, Ronnie,

558
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:46,915
he used to be
Professor Stein's other half.

559
00:27:47,498 --> 00:27:50,501
He actually helped to build
the Particle Accelerator,

560
00:27:50,711 --> 00:27:54,380
and when it exploded,
he was affected by it, too.

561
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:59,385
Ironically, that's how he got the chance
to show the world

562
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:02,889
what he was truly capable of.

563
00:28:04,515 --> 00:28:06,392
And he died saving this city.

564
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:09,395
Wait. He was the guy
that flew into the black hole?

565
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,606
That was him?

566
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:13,316
He was a hero.

567
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:15,110
You can be one, too.

568
00:28:15,401 --> 00:28:16,862
I never wanted to be a hero.

569
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,823
What I wanted was to go to college,
and we couldn't afford it.

Look, I know the Particle Accelerator took
something from you,

00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:30,458
but it also gave you something in return.

Something even more spectacular.

Thank you for coming.

677
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,919
You have no idea what this means to me.

678
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,506
My dad told me you were sick.

679

You know, I wasn't sure
that I could believe you,

680
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:57,928
so I did some checking.

Turns out you're telling the truth.

I would never lie to you
about something so big.

We're meeting in Pittsburgh in three days.

Why Pittsburgh?

715
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:38,946
A colleague of mine was monumental
in helping train Ronald and me.

716

She's graciously offered
to help the two of us as well.

Well, how is she going to help us?

Well, there were many aspects
of our abilities

719

that we never quite achieved.

720
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:50,458
Hopefully now,
we can fully realize that potential.

My dearest Dr. Snow.

722

Ronald may be lost to us,

Speaking of,

725
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,437
this was Ronnie's.

726
00:37:12,062 --> 00:37:14,565
He always used it
to find his way back home.

727

I want you to have it.

728

Thank you.

729
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:24,284
You know, this whole thing is strange.

731
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:28,496
Yeah, but you're 100% a hero.

732
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:33,042
I went ahead
and re-calibrated the splicer,

733
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,002
so the merging should be
even smoother now.

Thank you.

735

If I may offer you a bit
of parting advice.

736
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:43,093
Cisco, I know you're scared,

737
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:46,847
but this ability you have is a gift.

738
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:50,435
Not a curse. It's natural to be
apprehensive about the unknown.

739

But look, look at Jefferson.
