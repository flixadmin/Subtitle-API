1
00:00:02,281 --> 00:00:04,601
<i>I intend to do business
with Billy Kimber.</i>

2
00:00:05,841 --> 00:00:08,241
Is there any man here named Shelby?

3
00:00:08,321 --> 00:00:11,081
<i>I'm planning an expansion
onto the racetracks.</i>

4
00:00:11,281 --> 00:00:14,121
It would be an honour
to work with you, Mr Kimber.

5
00:00:14,321 --> 00:00:18,521
Nobody works "with" me.
People work "for" me.

6
00:00:18,841 --> 00:00:21,681
<i>Danny, you're a good man
and a good soldier.</i>

7
00:00:21,761 --> 00:00:23,441
Yes, Sergeant Major.

8
00:00:26,521 --> 00:00:29,321
Freddie Thorne is at the very top
of my list.

9
00:00:29,401 --> 00:00:33,281
Well, cross him off.
He won't be returning to the city.

10
00:00:33,801 --> 00:00:35,297
<i>We're not going anywhere, Ada.</i>

11
00:00:35,321 --> 00:00:37,841
We're gonna stay here, we're gonna
marry here, with our baby.

12
00:00:37,961 --> 00:00:40,281
<i>I'm not afraid of Tommy Shelby.</i>

13
00:00:40,601 --> 00:00:44,241
Thomas, you sell those guns to anyone
who has use to them, you will hang.

14
00:00:44,681 --> 00:00:46,801
<i>Dump them somewhere
the police can find them.</i>

15
00:00:47,001 --> 00:00:48,401
No.

16
00:00:48,761 --> 00:00:52,961
Thomas Shelby is now the beginning,
the middle and the end of your mission.

17
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:54,081
So what shall I do?

18
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:58,721
<i>You must do everything 
you can to get close to him.</i>

19
00:00:59,321 --> 00:01:02,241
Dig out a nice dress,
I want to take you to the races.

20
00:01:02,401 --> 00:01:04,881
I warn you, I'll break your heart.

21
00:01:06,081 --> 00:01:07,681
Already broken.

22
00:01:23,881 --> 00:01:28,841
<i>♪ Take a little walk to the edge of town
and go across the track</i>

23
00:01:31,601 --> 00:01:35,841
<i>♪ Where the viaduct looms

24
00:01:35,921 --> 00:01:39,201
<i>♪ As it shifts and cracks</i>

25
00:01:39,921 --> 00:01:46,361
<i>♪ Where secrets lie in the border fires

26
00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:51,481
<i>♪ Hey man, you know
you're never coming back ♪</i>

27
00:01:51,561 --> 00:01:52,841
Morning, sir.

28
00:01:56,841 --> 00:02:00,601
<i>♪ On a gathering storm comes
a tall handsome man</i>

29
00:02:00,681 --> 00:02:03,441
<i>♪ In a dusty black coat with
a red right hand ♪</i>

30
00:02:05,121 --> 00:02:07,601
Give me a bottle of whisky
and three glasses, please.

31
00:02:07,681 --> 00:02:09,561
- Scotch or Irish?
- Irish.

32
00:02:12,281 --> 00:02:15,801
I've decided not to go to the races.

33
00:02:15,921 --> 00:02:17,377
Not unless you give me another two pound

34
00:02:17,401 --> 00:02:18,641
ten shilling towards the dress.

35
00:02:20,161 --> 00:02:21,481
I've already given you three.

36
00:02:21,681 --> 00:02:23,721
How much did you pay for the suit
you'll be wearing?

37
00:02:24,201 --> 00:02:27,201
Oh, I don't pay for suits.
My suits are on the house.

38
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:28,561
Or the house burns down.

39
00:02:30,361 --> 00:02:32,321
So, you want me to go
looking like a flower girl?

40
00:02:33,241 --> 00:02:35,841
What I want makes no difference.

41
00:02:39,081 --> 00:02:41,041
It's not me you're dressing up for.

42
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,921
You'll forgive me, Mr Shelby,
if I indulge a little bit?

43
00:03:15,001 --> 00:03:16,401
Please.

44
00:03:17,161 --> 00:03:19,161
It takes a lot for a man from Sparkbrook

45
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:21,121
to step inside this pub.

46
00:03:21,721 --> 00:03:25,081
Anyone with money and good intentions
is welcome at The Garrison.

47
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:31,641
Now, you said you had business.

48
00:03:35,761 --> 00:03:37,441
It's delicate, Mr Shelby.

49
00:03:38,521 --> 00:03:41,201
It's a question
of who knows what about what.

50
00:03:42,881 --> 00:03:45,761
Concerns the factory
down the road at the BSA.

51
00:03:47,641 --> 00:03:51,361
Now, as you might know,
most of the paint shop there is Irish.

52
00:03:52,161 --> 00:03:55,441
Big old place like that,
rumours get started.

53
00:03:55,521 --> 00:03:57,321
Rumours that there was a robbery.

54
00:04:00,321 --> 00:04:01,521
Robbery of what?

55
00:04:02,121 --> 00:04:04,081
Guns, Mr Shelby.

56
00:04:04,481 --> 00:04:06,481
A serious amount of guns.

57
00:04:08,521 --> 00:04:10,121
And what business
is that of mine?

58
00:04:10,561 --> 00:04:14,401
When it comes to speculation,
you can't beat a factory night shift.

59
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:17,641
Some say there was word from the
proofing bay

60
00:04:18,481 --> 00:04:20,361
it was the Peaky Blinders
that took them.

61
00:04:22,481 --> 00:04:24,241
Your night shift must be dreaming.

62
00:04:24,321 --> 00:04:25,921
- Maybe they are.
- Maybe they're not.

63
00:04:26,561 --> 00:04:28,921
What we're trying to say is, Mr Shelby,

64
00:04:29,761 --> 00:04:33,401
that if you were to hear about
the whereabouts of said items,

65
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:36,001
we'd pay good money.

66
00:04:36,081 --> 00:04:39,241
- You have good money?
- We have the collections from the pubs.

67
00:04:42,441 --> 00:04:44,097
- For who do you speak?
- The people of Ireland.

68
00:04:44,121 --> 00:04:46,081
The Irish Republican Army.

69
00:04:46,641 --> 00:04:48,881
- For a fact?
- For a fucking fact.

70
00:04:54,481 --> 00:04:55,961
You think we're jokers?

71
00:04:56,961 --> 00:04:58,481
Am I laughing?

72
00:05:02,161 --> 00:05:07,881

I thought you only allowed

89
00:06:12,001 --> 00:06:13,481
Whisky's good proofing water.

90
00:06:14,081 --> 00:06:15,761
Tells you who's real and who isn't.

91
00:06:15,921 --> 00:06:17,641
And what did my countrymen want?

92
00:06:17,721 --> 00:06:19,161
Oh, they're nobodies.

93
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:21,881
They drink in The Black Swan
in Sparkbrook.

94
00:06:22,441 --> 00:06:24,721
They're only rebels because
they like the songs.

95
00:06:25,641 --> 00:06:26,841
You have sympathies with them?

96
00:06:27,361 --> 00:06:29,081
I have no sympathies of any description.

97
00:06:29,641 --> 00:06:32,321
Their accents are so thick,
it's a wonder you could understand them.

98
00:06:32,561 --> 00:06:34,481
Next time, I could translate.

99
00:06:34,841 --> 00:06:36,001
You would work for me?

100
00:06:37,401 --> 00:06:38,481
I thought I already was.

101
00:06:39,281 --> 00:06:40,881
So you are coming to the races.

102
00:06:43,241 --> 00:06:45,241
Two pounds, ten shillings.

103
00:06:49,081 --> 00:06:50,281
Ten shillings.

104
00:06:51,801 --> 00:06:53,201
Buy something red.

105
00:06:53,401 --> 00:06:54,761
To match his handkerchief.

106
00:06:55,201 --> 00:06:56,641
Whose handkerchief?

107
00:07:21,201 --> 00:07:22,441
Ada, what the hell?

108
00:07:22,801 --> 00:07:25,082
I dared myself to run
through their territory in my dress.

109
00:07:25,441 --> 00:07:26,721
- Are you mad?
- Yeah.

110
00:07:26,841 --> 00:07:28,521
Mad as hell with all of them.

111
00:07:28,601 --> 00:07:30,161
I love you.

112
00:07:32,321 --> 00:07:33,481
I love you, too.

113
00:07:33,761 --> 00:07:35,761
The more they try and stop us,
the madder I'll be.

114
00:07:35,961 --> 00:07:38,641
- Come on, princess. The vicar's waiting.
- Wait.

115
00:07:39,721 --> 00:07:41,561
How do I look?

116
00:07:46,281 --> 00:07:47,721
Like an angel.

117
00:08:03,241 --> 00:08:04,561
Moss,

118
00:08:05,681 --> 00:08:07,921
what do we know about The Black Swan?

119
00:08:08,561 --> 00:08:10,841
An operative has provided intelligence

120
00:08:11,961 --> 00:08:14,641
and it is a place where IRA men gather.

121
00:08:14,841 --> 00:08:19,001
It's just a lot of drunken navigators
singing songs, sir.

122
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:21,001
The IRA wouldn't go near them.

123
00:08:21,761 --> 00:08:24,041
Then why are two of them
looking to buy guns?

124
00:08:26,641 --> 00:08:28,121
Do you have names?

125
00:08:29,841 --> 00:08:31,761
Must she do everything for you?

126
00:08:32,201 --> 00:08:33,401
She, sir?

127
00:08:33,481 --> 00:08:37,081
One female operative
has proved more useful

128
00:08:38,121 --> 00:08:40,481
than any of you great lumps of men.

129
00:08:41,681 --> 00:08:45,721
We are regular police officers, sir,
not spies.

130
00:08:46,601 --> 00:08:48,841
We can only act when
a crime has been committed.

131
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:52,961
Perhaps I should send some men down
to The Black Swan to ask questions.

132
00:08:53,201 --> 00:08:54,961
And scare them all into hiding?

133
00:08:55,841 --> 00:08:57,561
Not the best of tactics, Sergeant.

134
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:01,001
My tactics come from
my experiences in France.

135
00:09:01,961 --> 00:09:06,441
Most of my great lumps of men
served in France too, sir.

136
00:09:08,641 --> 00:09:12,641
I serve my country every day.

137
00:09:13,521 --> 00:09:15,041
That'll be all, Sergeant.

138
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,561
Away and shite.

139
00:10:44,761 --> 00:10:46,401
Fancy me, do you?

140
00:10:47,841 --> 00:10:49,201
What are you?

141
00:10:49,481 --> 00:10:50,721
Copper?

142
00:10:53,201 --> 00:10:54,761
Proddie bitch!

143
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:59,201
I've seen you. I've seen your face
serving at The Garrison.

144
00:10:59,641 --> 00:11:01,521
Come here.

145
00:11:01,601 --> 00:11:03,641
I'm taking you in for interrogation.

146
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:06,081
On behalf of the Irish Free State.

147
00:11:32,481 --> 00:11:33,801
All right?

148
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:36,841
Are you armed?

149
00:11:39,121 --> 00:11:40,201
No.

150
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:43,401
Then I'll tell you.

151
00:11:45,601 --> 00:11:47,801
Ada and Freddie Thorne
were married today.

152
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,561
They defied your orders.

153
00:11:49,681 --> 00:11:51,241
They haven't left the city.

154
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,241
I'll deal with it.

155
00:12:08,401 --> 00:12:09,521
Thomas.

156
00:12:10,081 --> 00:12:11,601
I'll deal with it.

157
00:12:12,401 --> 00:12:13,801
Where are they?

158
00:12:14,841 --> 00:12:17,361
Freddie's comrades have safe houses.
Why do you want to know?

159
00:12:17,441 --> 00:12:19,561
I want to send them flowers.
Why do you think?

160
00:12:19,841 --> 00:12:21,561
Would it be so bad if they stayed?

161
00:12:23,721 --> 00:12:25,721
I promised I'd run Freddie out of town.

162
00:12:28,201 --> 00:12:29,561
Promised who?

163
00:12:40,681 --> 00:12:42,641
I told the coppers Freddie
wouldn't come back.

164
00:12:43,681 --> 00:12:46,241
- It was part of the deal.
- What bloody deal?

165
00:12:47,001 --> 00:12:50,281
What happened to family votes?
What happened to meetings?

166
00:12:52,841 --> 00:12:56,921
If you let me deal with Ada and Freddie,
it'll end in peace.

167
00:13:00,281 --> 00:13:02,281
Christ knows you've had
your fill of war.

168
00:13:07,961 --> 00:13:09,681
You get Freddie out of town, Pol.

169
00:13:10,521 --> 00:13:12,321
Or else I'll deal with it myself.

170
00:14:10,361 --> 00:14:13,281
The victim had been drinking
in The Black Swan pub, sir.

171
00:14:13,521 --> 00:14:15,201
The pub that you told me about.

172
00:14:15,801 --> 00:14:18,881
And the neighbour said that she saw
a young woman leaving the street

173
00:14:18,961 --> 00:14:20,841
where the body was found.

174
00:14:22,001 --> 00:14:23,321
A woman, sir.

175
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,761
I was wondering if
there was a connection.

176
00:14:26,321 --> 00:14:28,721
A connection with what, Sergeant?

177
00:14:29,321 --> 00:14:32,241
You said that your spy was a woman, sir.

178
00:14:32,881 --> 00:14:34,921
I wondered if there was now a policy.

179
00:14:38,801 --> 00:14:40,161
Shoot to kill.

180
00:14:40,761 --> 00:14:42,481
Like there was in Belfast.

181
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,121
Republicans are famously factional.

182
00:14:48,441 --> 00:14:50,561
He was killed by one of his own.

183
00:14:53,121 --> 00:14:54,681
That'll be all, Sergeant.

184
00:14:56,881 --> 00:14:59,081
And they're not called spies.

185
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:00,841
They're called operatives.

186
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:02,961
Operatives, sir. Right, sir.

187
00:15:07,601 --> 00:15:08,841
It's how you say things.

188
00:15:08,921 --> 00:15:10,041
Yeah.

189
00:15:12,921 --> 00:15:14,881
What the bloody hell
is she doing here?

190
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:18,001
200 pounds, Freddie.

191
00:15:19,881 --> 00:15:21,121
For what?

192
00:15:21,641 --> 00:15:22,881
For us.

193
00:15:23,601 --> 00:15:26,121
For a honeymoon that goes on forever.

194
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:32,801
- Where did it come from?
- Family fund.

195
00:15:33,601 --> 00:15:35,761
Pockets of widows and desperate men.

196
00:15:36,081 --> 00:15:37,801
See sense, Freddie.

197
00:15:37,881 --> 00:15:39,561
Tommy's not gonna let this rest.

198
00:15:39,721 --> 00:15:42,681
Times like these, communists
in the family is bad for business.

199
00:15:43,841 --> 00:15:45,161
You have to leave the city.

200
00:15:45,921 --> 00:15:48,001
You think I can't handle Tommy Shelby?

201
00:15:48,241 --> 00:15:51,561
You can't. I'm having trouble these days
and I'm twice the man you are.

202
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:57,441
I went into town.

203
00:15:58,681 --> 00:16:00,081
The Cunard office.

204
00:16:01,281 --> 00:16:03,481
I booked you both tickets
for the next boat

205
00:16:03,561 --> 00:16:04,961
from Liverpool to New York.

206
00:16:05,481 --> 00:16:07,001
America, Freddie.

207
00:16:07,481 --> 00:16:10,401
They've already had their revolution.
You won't have to bother.

208
00:16:17,881 --> 00:16:20,561
Would you ladies at least let a man
sleep on it?

209
00:16:53,521 --> 00:16:55,441
You had no business.

210
00:16:59,001 --> 00:17:01,641
Observe and report,
that is your remit.

211
00:17:01,961 --> 00:17:03,801
I decided we needed to know
where he lived.

212
00:17:04,161 --> 00:17:06,081
I warned you not to let your...

213
00:17:06,201 --> 00:17:08,961
Your personal history
cloud your judgement.

214
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,921
You went after him because he was IRA.

215
00:17:11,001 --> 00:17:14,001
I followed him because
I thought he might have information.

216
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:18,361
According to the rules, I should pull
you out of Garrison Lane immediately.

217
00:17:18,441 --> 00:17:19,521
No.

218
00:17:20,001 --> 00:17:21,521
Cheltenham's tomorrow.

219
00:17:23,161 --> 00:17:24,961
You take too much upon yourself.

220
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:29,361
This is an "active military mission".

221
00:17:29,441 --> 00:17:30,801
Your words.

222
00:17:30,881 --> 00:17:32,361
I'm doing my job.

223
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:33,921
Grace,

224
00:17:34,001 --> 00:17:37,881
the death of a base Fenian
doesn't concern me.

225
00:17:37,961 --> 00:17:39,641
Your welfare does.

226
00:17:41,161 --> 00:17:43,241
Killing a man affects the heart.

227
00:17:45,441 --> 00:17:46,961
And as for my heart.

228
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,241
I know that, because
of our family connections,

229
00:17:50,321 --> 00:17:52,881
you take my progress personally.

230
00:17:53,721 --> 00:17:55,681
But I don't need you to be my father.

231
00:17:59,081 --> 00:18:00,641
I will be thinking of you.

232
00:18:26,681 --> 00:18:27,881
Mr Shelby, sir?

233
00:18:27,961 --> 00:18:29,241
Mr Zhang.

234
00:18:30,921 --> 00:18:34,241
That suit is sold, sir.
It's being collected this morning.

235
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,321
I know.

236
00:18:42,081 --> 00:18:43,537
Please, gentlemen,
no fighting in here.

237
00:18:43,561 --> 00:18:46,001
It's all right. I come as a friend.

238
00:18:48,241 --> 00:18:50,561
You're collecting your suit
for Cheltenham. It's very nice.

239
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,201
How the bloody hell do you know?

240
00:18:52,681 --> 00:18:54,641
I know a lot of things, Mr Kimber.

241
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:58,081
And as I told you before,
I know the Lee brothers.

242
00:18:58,961 --> 00:19:01,321
And I know they're gonna be at
the Cheltenham races as well.

243
00:19:01,521 --> 00:19:03,097
Yes, well they're gonna
lose a lot of money on

244
00:19:03,121 --> 00:19:04,761
fast women and slow nags.

245
00:19:04,841 --> 00:19:07,641
No. They're planning
on showing up in numbers

246
00:19:07,721 --> 00:19:10,201
and robbing your bookies,
running chalk and rafflers.

247
00:19:11,081 --> 00:19:12,881
You think I can't handle the Lees?

248
00:19:13,161 --> 00:19:15,601
Just a word of warning
from a friend. That's all.

249
00:19:19,001 --> 00:19:20,641
I'll see you at Cheltenham.

250
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:23,321
I'll wave at you from my box.

251
00:19:24,161 --> 00:19:27,121
If you're coming to the races,
bring that pretty barmaid of yours.

252
00:19:27,801 --> 00:19:29,321
Already invited.

253
00:19:33,121 --> 00:19:34,841
Come on, Freddie. Comrades.

254
00:19:35,121 --> 00:19:40,761
Comrades, as you know, to even
gather like this today is illegal.

255
00:19:41,481 --> 00:19:43,721
Chief Inspector Campbell has ordered

256
00:19:43,801 --> 00:19:47,401
that we're not allowed to assemble
in groups of more than three people.

257
00:19:48,361 --> 00:19:52,681
So, to comply with the law, please now
clump together in groups of three.

258
00:19:56,441 --> 00:19:58,201
Do you hear that, boys?

259
00:19:58,281 --> 00:20:01,001
The same whistles they used to blow
to send us over the top

260
00:20:01,361 --> 00:20:04,041
they now blow to try and break us up.

261
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,841
So before the Specials get in,

262
00:20:06,241 --> 00:20:09,041
raise your hands
all those who want to strike.

263
00:20:12,641 --> 00:20:14,041
Now disperse.

264
00:20:14,121 --> 00:20:16,161
Disperse and take the message home.

265
00:20:16,881 --> 00:20:19,321
United, we will never be defeated.

266
00:20:19,481 --> 00:20:20,561
Yes! Yes!

267
00:20:29,641 --> 00:20:31,681
Tommy. Oi, Tommy.

268
00:20:32,321 --> 00:20:33,841
What the hell's being happening?

269
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:36,841
The police have just raided
a rally at the factory.

270
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:38,801
We're thinking Freddie Thorne's back.

271
00:20:38,961 --> 00:20:40,801
I know he is, and he's with Ada.

272
00:20:41,121 --> 00:20:43,721
How hard can it be to find
the only girl in Birmingham

273
00:20:43,801 --> 00:20:45,121
with four-inch heels, eh?

274
00:20:45,361 --> 00:20:46,681
She's with the commies.

275
00:20:46,881 --> 00:20:49,521
They have little rat holes
all over the city.

276
00:20:50,601 --> 00:20:51,761
Just wanna know where she is.

277
00:20:52,441 --> 00:20:54,401
Tommy, you'd best have a word
with Arthur as well.

278
00:20:55,081 --> 00:20:56,961
What's wrong with bloody Arthur?

279
00:20:57,921 --> 00:20:59,761
He's got the Flanders blues again.

280
00:21:39,561 --> 00:21:43,161
People keep asking me questions
that I don't know the answer to.

281
00:21:47,961 --> 00:21:50,201
Is it true your Ada got married?

282
00:21:52,481 --> 00:21:54,041
I say, "I don't know."

283
00:21:56,121 --> 00:21:57,641
"Where is she living then?"

284
00:22:00,241 --> 00:22:01,761
"I don't know."

285
00:22:03,641 --> 00:22:05,241
"Arthur,"

286
00:22:07,761 --> 00:22:10,161
"who killed the Paddy
from The Black Swan?"

287
00:22:12,961 --> 00:22:15,521
I go, "What Paddy?"

288
00:22:19,561 --> 00:22:21,001
They say,

289
00:22:22,481 --> 00:22:24,561
"Is it you Peaky Blinders"

290
00:22:25,561 --> 00:22:27,361
"who stole the guns"

291
00:22:27,961 --> 00:22:30,081
"from the BSA?"

292
00:22:38,001 --> 00:22:39,841
What guns, Tommy?

293
00:22:41,921 --> 00:22:44,601
Arthur, after your beating,
I thought you needed a break.

294
00:22:44,681 --> 00:22:47,401
What bloody guns, Tommy?

295
00:22:50,081 --> 00:22:51,401
Arthur, I was gonna tell you.

296
00:22:51,481 --> 00:22:52,961
You were gonna tell me?

297
00:22:53,201 --> 00:22:55,361
Arthur, listen to me.

298
00:22:57,401 --> 00:23:00,841
You've had a hard time these past
few years. God knows you have.

299
00:23:01,601 --> 00:23:03,481
You deserve some rest.

300
00:23:05,241 --> 00:23:06,961
We had some luck.

301
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:09,721
Some bloody luck.

302
00:23:10,361 --> 00:23:13,121
It fell off a wagon into our laps.

303
00:23:13,561 --> 00:23:15,401
And all you need to know is,

304
00:23:15,481 --> 00:23:18,521
it's us that has the machine guns now.

305
00:23:18,601 --> 00:23:20,641
And it's them that's in the mud.

306
00:23:22,721 --> 00:23:24,241
All right?

307
00:23:31,761 --> 00:23:33,001
Come on.

308
00:23:34,281 --> 00:23:35,801
I have a surprise for you.

309
00:23:36,441 --> 00:23:37,561
Come on.

310
00:24:01,961 --> 00:24:03,361
Surprise.

311
00:24:03,641 --> 00:24:05,121
Where is she?

312
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:10,041
What is it you've always wanted, Arthur?

313
00:24:10,481 --> 00:24:11,561
Eh?

314
00:24:12,121 --> 00:24:14,281
When we were in France, you used to say,

315
00:24:15,081 --> 00:24:18,361
"When I go back to England,
I want to own my own pub."

316
00:24:21,361 --> 00:24:22,841
Well.

317
00:24:26,441 --> 00:24:27,921
Now you've gone soft.

318
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:30,561
You've gone soft, Tommy.

319
00:24:33,161 --> 00:24:35,001
How do we know it's for sale?

320
00:24:35,401 --> 00:24:37,441
Everything is for sale to us, Arthur.

321
00:24:38,961 --> 00:24:41,161
We're making a lot of money these days.

322
00:24:41,681 --> 00:24:43,361
We need a legitimate business

323
00:24:43,601 --> 00:24:45,721
to pass the money from the shop.

324
00:24:46,681 --> 00:24:48,601
I wouldn't know what to do.

325
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:53,041
You spent two-thirds of your life
in pubs, just pour it.

326
00:24:53,321 --> 00:24:55,121
Instead of drinking it.

327
00:24:56,201 --> 00:24:57,921
But I can still drink it though, right?

328
00:24:58,001 --> 00:25:00,361
Your pub, you do what you want.

329
00:25:03,561 --> 00:25:06,161
Ah. Sorry, gentlemen.

330
00:25:06,721 --> 00:25:08,121
Didn't hear you come in.

331
00:25:08,801 --> 00:25:10,121
What can I get you?

332
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:30,921
Bloody kids.

333
00:25:31,601 --> 00:25:33,241
Think the other one's punctured as well.

334
00:25:35,841 --> 00:25:37,761
Mr Campbell wants an explanation.

335
00:25:38,561 --> 00:25:39,681
Today,

336
00:25:39,761 --> 00:25:43,761
some rebel-rousing union man
brought the BSA out on strike.

337
00:25:45,881 --> 00:25:47,361
Freddie Thorne.

338
00:25:48,601 --> 00:25:50,441
I thought you promised
he wouldn't come back.

339
00:25:50,801 --> 00:25:52,161
I know he's in town.

340
00:25:52,241 --> 00:25:53,521
I'm dealing with it.

341
00:25:53,641 --> 00:25:57,161
Mr Campbell thought that
you controlled these territories.

342
00:25:57,561 --> 00:25:58,641
Yeah.

343
00:26:00,121 --> 00:26:02,001
I said I'm dealing with it.

344
00:26:03,521 --> 00:26:05,321
I heard that, er,

345
00:26:06,721 --> 00:26:08,401
Freddie married your sister.

346
00:26:09,241 --> 00:26:10,921
Some family you've got, eh?

347
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:13,001
Bet you can't wait for Christmas.

348
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:17,001
Deliver Freddie Thorne to us,

349
00:26:18,241 --> 00:26:20,801
or we'll take your sister in
as an accomplice.

350
00:26:21,241 --> 00:26:23,561
She'll get four years for sedition.

351
00:26:25,561 --> 00:26:27,321
Or you can turn him in.

352
00:26:27,881 --> 00:26:29,601
And your sister goes free.

353
00:26:37,241 --> 00:26:39,401
I'll say goodnight then, Tom.

354
00:27:06,241 --> 00:27:07,601
Have you seen Freddie Thorne?

355
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:10,001
- No.
- Or Tommy?

356
00:27:25,801 --> 00:27:27,841
- We have to find Freddie.
- Drink this first.

357
00:27:27,921 --> 00:27:30,057
No, we have to find them.
I think they're gonna kill each other.

358
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:32,121
Wait. Who's going to kill who?

359
00:27:34,081 --> 00:27:35,321
We need to talk.

360
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:44,401
What exactly is it
that you want, Freddie?

361
00:27:46,321 --> 00:27:48,001
I came to tell you.

362
00:27:51,241 --> 00:27:53,001
That's not gonna work, Tommy.

363
00:27:55,401 --> 00:27:56,841
Polly came round.

364
00:27:57,681 --> 00:27:59,041
She gave me that.

365
00:28:01,121 --> 00:28:02,321
Well,

366
00:28:02,401 --> 00:28:04,561
Polly must've had a rush of blood.

367
00:28:04,961 --> 00:28:06,801
Or port wine.

368
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:10,441
Your honesty is appreciated. Now,
if you're not gonna use that thing

369
00:28:10,521 --> 00:28:11,641
I'm not finished!

370
00:28:12,561 --> 00:28:13,761
Sit down.

371
00:28:14,321 --> 00:28:16,241
Sit down. Sit!

372
00:28:21,841 --> 00:28:23,561
Talk to me about the guns.

373
00:28:26,001 --> 00:28:29,121
Do you remember we used to jump
in here and see who could swim across

374
00:28:29,201 --> 00:28:31,401
I'm here to talk business, Tommy.

375
00:28:34,041 --> 00:28:35,841
Do you reckon we could still do it?

376
00:28:50,441 --> 00:28:52,801
You loaded Ada with your bastard

377
00:28:53,201 --> 00:28:54,881
because she's a Shelby.

378
00:28:55,921 --> 00:28:58,361
You thought it'd mean you'd be somebody.

379
00:29:00,161 --> 00:29:03,441
I won't let you fuck up my sister's life
for your cause.

380
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:09,721
My God,

381
00:29:14,281 --> 00:29:16,361
you actually believe that?

382
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:24,361
I love her, Tommy.

383
00:29:26,081 --> 00:29:28,721
I've loved her since she was nine
and I was twelve.

384
00:29:30,681 --> 00:29:32,681
She loves me the same.

385
00:29:40,761 --> 00:29:42,761
Do you even know the word?

386
00:29:46,081 --> 00:29:48,321
This marriage will not stand.

387
00:29:58,561 --> 00:30:00,081
Shh.

388
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:21,921
Freddie

389
00:30:22,001 --> 00:30:23,681
didn't want your money.

390
00:30:24,321 --> 00:30:27,641
And now the coppers are saying that
if we don't turn Freddie in,

391
00:30:27,721 --> 00:30:29,721
they'll put Ada
on the arrest warrant as well.

392
00:30:30,601 --> 00:30:32,881
That's where your compassion
gets you, Pol.

393
00:30:33,761 --> 00:30:36,241
From now on, we do it my way.

394
00:30:37,641 --> 00:30:39,001
Or what?

395
00:31:17,001 --> 00:31:18,681
Freddie?

396
00:31:19,681 --> 00:31:21,561
<i>"TOMMY". Are you getting closer?</i>

397
00:31:25,241 --> 00:31:26,521
I'll lead.

398
00:31:26,601 --> 00:31:29,361
Watch yourself, Danny. Tommy.

399
00:31:36,841 --> 00:31:38,561
<i>"TOMMY". Be careful, Danny.</i>

400
00:32:03,641 --> 00:32:05,001
Shh, shh.

401
00:32:10,441 --> 00:32:12,641
Tommy!

402
00:32:24,681 --> 00:32:26,201
Tommy!

403
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,161
Tommy.

404
00:32:29,361 --> 00:32:32,801
Tommy. Tommy.

405
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,121
It's open.

406
00:32:47,241 --> 00:32:49,161
Private Whizz-Bang reporting, sir.

407
00:32:49,441 --> 00:32:51,161
At ease.

408
00:33:05,241 --> 00:33:07,721
So, what news from London?

409
00:33:08,481 --> 00:33:09,841
I was in a pub.

410
00:33:10,401 --> 00:33:13,401
It was called The Mother Red Cap.
An Irish pub.

411
00:33:14,441 --> 00:33:16,881
I got talking to
some old bloke about Birmingham.

412
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:19,321
He said there's been trouble.

413
00:33:19,641 --> 00:33:21,161
An IRA man shot.

414
00:33:22,681 --> 00:33:25,041
He said a lot, but the only bit I heard

415
00:33:25,121 --> 00:33:27,921
was that their high command think
it's the Peaky Blinders who shot him.

416
00:33:29,921 --> 00:33:31,601
I came up on the next boat to warn you.

417
00:33:33,681 --> 00:33:34,881
Is it true?

418
00:33:36,161 --> 00:33:37,761
No.

419
00:33:38,481 --> 00:33:41,641
- But lies travel faster than the truth.
- Hmm.

420
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:45,201
Get a message to them.

421
00:33:46,201 --> 00:33:48,401
Tell 'em to send someone to parlay.

422
00:33:48,641 --> 00:33:51,961
Tell 'em there's been a misunderstanding
and we don't want any trouble.

423
00:33:55,401 --> 00:33:57,681
You've got enough trouble, right, Tommy?

424
00:33:59,361 --> 00:34:02,241
The whisky and the smoke.

425
00:34:07,601 --> 00:34:09,561
I can smell it in the air.

426
00:34:12,561 --> 00:34:14,481
Use it sometimes myself.

427
00:34:15,521 --> 00:34:18,601
Call it my sweetheart.

428
00:34:20,601 --> 00:34:22,721
They gave us the worst job, Tommy.

429
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:26,321
Yeah...

430
00:34:26,401 --> 00:34:28,161
And we fucking volunteered.

431
00:34:42,641 --> 00:34:44,761
Sometimes it lasts all night.

432
00:34:47,521 --> 00:34:49,201
And I lie here

433
00:34:49,841 --> 00:34:52,481
and I listen to the shovels...

434
00:34:52,561 --> 00:34:54,441
And the picks

435
00:34:54,521 --> 00:34:56,441
against that wall there.

436
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:04,641
And I pray the sun will come up with
the curtains before they break through.

437
00:35:07,361 --> 00:35:08,961
<i>"TOMMY". No, I don't pray.</i>

438
00:35:09,601 --> 00:35:10,681
<i>I hope.</i>

439
00:35:12,681 --> 00:35:15,401
<i>But sometimes it happens.</i>

440
00:35:15,481 --> 00:35:17,321
<i>The sun beats them.</i>

441
00:35:18,361 --> 00:35:19,961
<i>But mostly...</i>

442
00:35:22,961 --> 00:35:25,321
<i>The shovels beat the sun.</i>

443
00:36:46,041 --> 00:36:47,441
Your sister was here.

444
00:36:52,441 --> 00:36:54,041
She was worried
you and Freddie...

445
00:36:55,401 --> 00:36:56,721
It had made her sick.

446
00:36:58,961 --> 00:37:01,801
She's all right,
but in her condition she needs peace.

447
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:04,841
Women talk.

448
00:37:04,921 --> 00:37:06,361
That is something they do.

449
00:37:08,841 --> 00:37:10,041
She talked about you.

450
00:37:12,721 --> 00:37:14,281
She said you keep everything locked up.

451
00:37:15,841 --> 00:37:17,241
Well...

452
00:37:17,321 --> 00:37:18,921
That's what men do.

453
00:37:19,681 --> 00:37:21,041
Your sister's nice. I like her.

454
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:23,801
Can't be easy for her.

455
00:37:24,161 --> 00:37:26,401
Her brother and her husband
fighting over the same thing.

456
00:37:32,121 --> 00:37:34,161
Men should talk too.

457
00:37:35,041 --> 00:37:36,321
To you?

458
00:37:39,081 --> 00:37:40,321
Why not?

459
00:37:40,641 --> 00:37:42,361
I'm a barmaid. It's my job.

460
00:37:43,161 --> 00:37:45,521
Men always tell their troubles
to a barmaid.

461
00:37:47,121 --> 00:37:49,801
What is it you and Freddie
are fighting over?

462
00:38:02,521 --> 00:38:05,321
I'll meet you here at 9:00
tomorrow morning.

463
00:38:09,081 --> 00:38:10,241
Did you buy a dress?

464
00:38:11,321 --> 00:38:13,561
Yes, I bought a dress.

465
00:38:14,321 --> 00:38:15,721
How does it look?

466
00:39:33,841 --> 00:39:35,761
He's changed the oil
and greased her up.

467
00:39:36,721 --> 00:39:39,201
So will it get me all the way
to Cheltenham, Curly?

468
00:39:39,601 --> 00:39:41,641
He's good with motors but it pains him.

469
00:39:42,081 --> 00:39:44,481
No heart in motor cars.
I can't talk to them.

470
00:39:44,561 --> 00:39:47,561
Yeah... Tommy might need
to make a fast getaway.

471
00:39:48,321 --> 00:39:50,241
The Lees will be all over the track.

472
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:52,161
And Kimber's men.

473
00:39:52,241 --> 00:39:54,481
And his coppers, they control the law
down there, Tommy.

474
00:39:54,561 --> 00:39:56,201
Give 'er a turn for me, Charlie.

475
00:40:03,721 --> 00:40:05,601
This car only seats four.

476
00:40:05,681 --> 00:40:08,041
You'll need more men than that
if you're to come back alive.

477
00:40:08,481 --> 00:40:09,761
But it's just me and the girl.

478
00:40:19,561 --> 00:40:21,921
Is it just the two of us
going to the races?

479
00:40:22,001 --> 00:40:23,321
Something like that.

480
00:40:57,881 --> 00:40:59,601
Attention!

481
00:41:00,081 --> 00:41:01,721
Right.

482
00:41:01,881 --> 00:41:06,441
This is what's known as your final
briefing before going over the top.

483
00:41:06,521 --> 00:41:09,161
Sixty miles down that road
is Cheltenham race track.

484
00:41:09,481 --> 00:41:11,921
Johnny, what's our mission, boy?

485
00:41:12,001 --> 00:41:15,041
To stick it to the Lee family, Arthur!

486
00:41:15,241 --> 00:41:16,601
That's right.

487
00:41:16,681 --> 00:41:19,241
The Lees are skimming money
off legal bookies,

488
00:41:19,761 --> 00:41:22,281
running chalk, selling rafflers.

489
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:24,281
And beating up them as won't buy.

490
00:41:24,721 --> 00:41:25,961
But, today...

491
00:41:26,641 --> 00:41:29,361
- We're gonna stop them.
- What about Kimber's men?

492
00:41:29,441 --> 00:41:31,041
Thought he had his own protection.

493
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:33,281
Kimber's let his troops go rotten.

494
00:41:34,281 --> 00:41:37,281
They're on the take from the Lees
to look the other way.

495
00:41:38,441 --> 00:41:40,721
We're gonna show Kimber
how it should be done.

496
00:41:41,321 --> 00:41:42,761
Now take what you're good at.

497
00:41:43,041 --> 00:41:45,761
Those of you with guns,
keep them out of it

498
00:41:45,841 --> 00:41:48,481
unless a gun is pulled on you.
We want this done quietly.

499
00:41:52,081 --> 00:41:53,961
So when do we share out the cash?

500
00:41:54,041 --> 00:41:56,761
We don't. We're not keeping the cash.

501
00:41:57,241 --> 00:41:59,521
You're in Tommy's army now, boys.

502
00:42:00,161 --> 00:42:01,801
Trust only kin.

503
00:42:03,561 --> 00:42:05,201
Let's go.

504
00:42:22,721 --> 00:42:24,881
What stable's he?
Number seven, isn't it?

505
00:42:24,961 --> 00:42:26,881
Are you sure we're allowed in here?

506
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:29,641
Well, I prefer to come to the races
the back way.

507
00:42:30,041 --> 00:42:32,081
Keeps me out of trouble.

508
00:42:32,161 --> 00:42:34,281
Tracks are lawless places.

509
00:42:34,361 --> 00:42:37,041
Can't stand petty criminals. This way.

510
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:38,321
Will we get to lay a bet?

511
00:42:38,401 --> 00:42:40,521
Nah. Gambling's for mugs.

512
00:42:40,601 --> 00:42:42,361
This way.

513
00:42:42,681 --> 00:42:43,841
You're lucky you're with me

514
00:42:43,921 --> 00:42:46,241
or you'd be wasting your money
on fixed races.

515
00:42:46,321 --> 00:42:48,801
I always wondered,
how do you fix a race?

516
00:42:48,881 --> 00:42:50,561
How should I know?

517
00:42:52,721 --> 00:42:55,921
- Okay. You do the talking.
- What?

518
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:59,361
Tell security you are Lady Sarah...

519
00:42:59,441 --> 00:43:01,561
Excuse us. Excuse us.

520
00:43:01,641 --> 00:43:03,881
Lady Sarah Duggan of Connemara.

521
00:43:03,961 --> 00:43:06,801
You got lost when you went
to look for the boy riding your horse.

522
00:43:06,881 --> 00:43:10,161
Uh, Dandy Flower. If they ask about me,
say that I'm Prussian.

523
00:43:10,241 --> 00:43:12,121
Don't speak a word of English.

524
00:43:12,561 --> 00:43:14,801
Come on, posh girl.
Earn your three quid.

525
00:43:45,681 --> 00:43:47,281
I still prefer The Garrison.

526
00:43:51,121 --> 00:43:52,521
Do you dance?

527
00:43:53,481 --> 00:43:55,281
If I am asked properly.

528
00:43:57,401 --> 00:43:59,841
Lady Sarah of Connemara,

529
00:43:59,921 --> 00:44:01,681
will you dance with me?

530
00:45:00,201 --> 00:45:02,681
Roberts, the Peaky Blinders are here.

531
00:45:03,561 --> 00:45:04,961
Told you, Mr Kimber.

532
00:45:05,161 --> 00:45:06,801
He's got some balls, that one.

533
00:45:06,881 --> 00:45:08,921
And she's got some body, that one.

534
00:45:21,601 --> 00:45:24,001
Chalk. For your blackboard.

535
00:45:24,201 --> 00:45:25,881
Five pound a stick.

536
00:45:29,961 --> 00:45:32,081
It's a pleasure doing business with you.

537
00:45:36,481 --> 00:45:38,961
Hello, Reg. How's business?

538
00:45:44,881 --> 00:45:47,041
Fucker, get up!

539
00:45:56,121 --> 00:45:59,601
Stay still, Reg, or I'll take
the whole ear off.

540
00:45:59,681 --> 00:46:01,441
And you're gonna need
your ears to listen.

541
00:46:02,241 --> 00:46:05,561
No more chalking on Billy Kimber's boys.

542
00:46:05,841 --> 00:46:08,041
Right?

543
00:46:08,281 --> 00:46:10,321
We're the protection now.

544
00:46:12,441 --> 00:46:15,001
I commandeer this stolen money,

545
00:46:15,361 --> 00:46:19,001
by order of the Peaky Blinders.

546
00:46:45,961 --> 00:46:47,881
Either your left leg is stronger
than your right

547
00:46:47,961 --> 00:46:49,161
or we're making a getaway.

548
00:46:49,241 --> 00:46:51,121
Hey! Neither.

549
00:46:51,281 --> 00:46:53,361
I hope this doesn't involve
razor blades.

550
00:46:53,441 --> 00:46:55,481
I've decided to move up in the world.

551
00:46:55,561 --> 00:46:57,321
Become a legitimate businessman.

552
00:46:57,681 --> 00:46:58,921
My gosh, you're serious.

553
00:46:59,521 --> 00:47:01,841
I'm always serious.

554
00:47:04,001 --> 00:47:05,401
We chased the Lees across the track

555
00:47:05,441 --> 00:47:07,281
right the way down the Devon Road.

556
00:47:07,361 --> 00:47:09,081
We got every penny back.

557
00:47:09,161 --> 00:47:11,281
Nice dress.

558
00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:12,841
You can wear that in my pub.

559
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:15,401
Buy the boys a drink. Anyone hurt?

560
00:47:15,481 --> 00:47:16,881
Ah... A few cuts and bruises.

561
00:47:17,761 --> 00:47:19,281
Off we go, Lady Sarah.

562
00:47:26,481 --> 00:47:27,721
Steady on.

563
00:47:28,161 --> 00:47:30,041
Excuse me. Cheers.

564
00:47:37,361 --> 00:47:38,881
Your money, Mr Kimber.

565
00:47:40,241 --> 00:47:42,441
Rescued from the Lee brothers

566
00:47:42,521 --> 00:47:46,041
and returned to you
with a request for a fair hearing.

567
00:47:47,321 --> 00:47:49,801
Your own protection is failing,
Mr Kimber.

568
00:47:50,561 --> 00:47:52,761
Your boys are taking cuts.

569
00:47:53,601 --> 00:47:55,881
I want to suggest that from now on,

570
00:47:55,961 --> 00:47:59,801
you contract out your racetrack security
to the Peaky Blinders.

571
00:48:00,801 --> 00:48:03,001
We'd be saving you
a lot of money, Mr Kimber.

572
00:48:03,681 --> 00:48:05,081
Lot of money.

573
00:48:05,241 --> 00:48:07,841
In return, you give us...

574
00:48:08,961 --> 00:48:10,921
Five percent of the take

575
00:48:11,401 --> 00:48:13,441
and three legal betting pitches

576
00:48:13,521 --> 00:48:15,761
at every race meeting
north of the River Severn.

577
00:48:15,961 --> 00:48:20,201
Rising to six after one year
if we're all satisfied with the service.

578
00:48:22,641 --> 00:48:24,281
What do you say, Mr Kimber?

579
00:48:29,001 --> 00:48:31,441
I say you talk business
to my accountant.

580
00:48:31,801 --> 00:48:33,561
I want a dance.

581
00:48:45,041 --> 00:48:47,601
Your man said it was all right
for me to have this dance.

582
00:49:10,321 --> 00:49:12,921
How many men can you put
in the field at one time?

583
00:49:13,641 --> 00:49:15,521
There's a lot of men
out of work at the moment.

584
00:49:16,241 --> 00:49:18,001
Two guards for every bookie.

585
00:49:18,081 --> 00:49:19,761
At every meeting.

586
00:49:21,081 --> 00:49:24,121
We have contacts with good people
among the gypsies.

587
00:49:24,201 --> 00:49:26,961
We'll always know
when the Lees plan to attack.

588
00:49:27,841 --> 00:49:30,081
With all the strikes and troubles,

589
00:49:30,161 --> 00:49:32,321
can't really depend on the police.

590
00:49:32,401 --> 00:49:34,881
Anyway, we're more honest.

591
00:49:36,521 --> 00:49:38,001
Looks like you two are making a deal.

592
00:49:38,281 --> 00:49:39,601
We are making progress.

593
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:44,281
Then let me throw
a small condition into the mix.

594
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:02,641
So, listen, uh...

595
00:50:02,721 --> 00:50:05,041
We're gonna go for dinner
at Kimber's house.

596
00:50:05,121 --> 00:50:07,361
He has a place a couple of miles away.

597
00:50:07,681 --> 00:50:10,481
I have some business to settle first
with his accountant, so...

598
00:50:10,761 --> 00:50:12,841
You go on ahead with Kimber.

599
00:50:14,001 --> 00:50:15,521
Just me and him?

600
00:50:15,681 --> 00:50:18,321
Yeah. Till I'm done here.

601
00:50:18,721 --> 00:50:19,921
Is that all right?

602
00:50:22,321 --> 00:50:26,001
Look, I'll throw in an extra three quid
for your extra time.

603
00:50:28,041 --> 00:50:29,521
You think I'm a whore.

604
00:50:31,561 --> 00:50:34,361
Everyone's a whore, Grace.

605
00:50:34,441 --> 00:50:36,601
We just sell different parts
of ourselves.

606
00:50:37,081 --> 00:50:38,961
You said you wanted to work for me.

607
00:50:39,041 --> 00:50:40,841
To do that you have to sharpen up.

608
00:50:40,921 --> 00:50:43,121
The deal is, I'll give him
two hours with you.

609
00:50:43,881 --> 00:50:45,721
He thinks he's a ladies' man.

610
00:50:45,801 --> 00:50:47,321
He thinks he can seduce you.

611
00:50:47,401 --> 00:50:49,761
Whenever you want,
just kick him in the balls.

612
00:50:49,841 --> 00:50:51,601
I'm a clause in a contract.

613
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:55,321
If you wanna be part of my organisation,
you have to make sacrifices.

614
00:50:59,441 --> 00:51:02,441
Do we have a deal? As a sweetener,
you can try your luck with mine.

615
00:51:04,441 --> 00:51:05,841
Yeah, we have a deal.

616
00:51:05,921 --> 00:51:07,721
- Two hours?
- Yeah.

617
00:51:07,801 --> 00:51:10,481
Side bet, 10 pounds says
I'll have her fucked in one.

618
00:51:13,001 --> 00:51:14,361
Mademoiselle.

619
00:51:24,841 --> 00:51:26,641
I bet he said you could have me,
didn't he?

620
00:51:29,001 --> 00:51:30,441
While he has her.

621
00:51:31,041 --> 00:51:32,681
That's the arrangement, isn't it?

622
00:51:36,481 --> 00:51:38,681
Yours might be a prostitute,
but I'm not.

623
00:51:40,121 --> 00:51:41,921
I was a milliner when I met him.

624
00:51:43,161 --> 00:51:44,801
I was independent.

625
00:51:47,641 --> 00:51:49,681
I made this hat.

626
00:51:50,481 --> 00:51:52,081
I was a good milliner.

627
00:51:53,161 --> 00:51:55,121
It's a very pretty hat.

628
00:51:56,921 --> 00:51:58,561
Really is.

629
00:52:08,401 --> 00:52:10,241
So is she a prostitute?

630
00:52:11,881 --> 00:52:13,601
God's honest truth,

631
00:52:14,281 --> 00:52:15,961
I don't know what she is.

632
00:52:25,121 --> 00:52:27,921
You showed me up
back there at the races.

633
00:52:31,041 --> 00:52:33,881
Why don't you teach me
how to dance properly?

634
00:52:35,081 --> 00:52:37,761
The music's too slow.
Put on a Charleston.

635
00:52:37,921 --> 00:52:40,521
Well, then we'd be far away.
I want to dance like this.

636
00:52:42,321 --> 00:52:45,481
Come on, you weren't so stiff
back there, were you? Hmm?

637
00:52:47,001 --> 00:52:48,921
You ever been in a house this big?

638
00:52:50,441 --> 00:52:51,761
Hmm?

639
00:52:52,481 --> 00:52:54,161
Mmm. Look at you.

640
00:52:57,081 --> 00:52:59,521
You look like a bloody film star.

641
00:53:04,081 --> 00:53:05,761
I want a cigarette.

642
00:53:15,921 --> 00:53:18,121
Oh, look, I've dropped something.

643
00:53:18,321 --> 00:53:19,881
Pick it up.

644
00:53:19,961 --> 00:53:22,201
- Pick it up yourself.
- You're a fucking barmaid.

645
00:53:22,281 --> 00:53:24,481
If I drop a glass on the floor,
you pick it up.

646
00:53:24,561 --> 00:53:26,281
I want to watch you pick it up.

647
00:53:30,401 --> 00:53:32,521
Right, you little slag.

648
00:53:32,681 --> 00:53:35,521
I tried to be nice. Yeah?

649
00:53:35,601 --> 00:53:38,801
If I drop a glass on the floor,

650
00:53:39,241 --> 00:53:43,401
you bend over and fucking pick up
the fucking glass.

651
00:53:43,481 --> 00:53:45,721
- Okay? What?
- No, sir. No.

652
00:53:45,801 --> 00:53:47,321
What are you doing here?

653
00:53:47,401 --> 00:53:49,521
- I've got another hour.
- Just wait.

654
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:52,441
Listen to me. Just listen to me.

655
00:53:52,881 --> 00:53:55,441
I was going to let you go through
with this but, in the end,

656
00:53:55,521 --> 00:53:59,521
my conscience got the better of me.
She looks good on the outside,

657
00:54:01,961 --> 00:54:03,761
but she has the clap.

658
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:08,081
Yeah. Syphilis.

659
00:54:09,441 --> 00:54:11,257
When you took a shine to her,
I thought I'd use her.

660
00:54:11,281 --> 00:54:13,801
Someone told me she had the syph,
I thought, "What the hell?"

661
00:54:16,561 --> 00:54:18,561
Call it my better nature.

662
00:54:19,401 --> 00:54:21,041
She's, uh, she's a whore.

663
00:54:26,561 --> 00:54:29,481
- Well, just go and wait in the car.
- I can walk on my own.

664
00:54:34,561 --> 00:54:36,601
Can we shake hands
and forget this ever happened?

665
00:55:01,681 --> 00:55:04,401
Start of the day,
I was Lady Sarah of Connemara.

666
00:55:05,961 --> 00:55:09,041
By the end, I was a whore with the clap.

667
00:55:11,161 --> 00:55:13,601
You're a fucking bastard,
offering me like that.

668
00:55:19,561 --> 00:55:21,601
But then you change your mind.

669
00:55:25,441 --> 00:55:27,361
Why did you change your mind, Thomas?

670
