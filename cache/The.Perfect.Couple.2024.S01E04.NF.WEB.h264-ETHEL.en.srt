1
00:00:08,125 --> 00:00:11,375
<i>This is Coast Guard,
Cutter Victoria. Negative on the kids.</i>

2
00:00:11,458 --> 00:00:13,833
<i>Reports of a Beetle Cat
north-east of here.</i>

3
00:00:13,916 --> 00:00:15,416
<i>We'll investigate. Over.</i>

4
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:40,708
This is Merritt's?

5
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:43,375
She was wearing it that night.
Tag gave it to her.

6
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:46,750
They're covering something up.

7
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:49,041
<i>What if they're all in on it or something?</i>

8
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:51,375
Okay, let's start at the beginning.

9
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:53,625
So Tag knew Merritt was pregnant?

10
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:55,250
Yes, she told him that night.

11
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:57,500
Did she tell anyone else?

12
00:00:58,041 --> 00:00:59,958
I mean, me, but...

13
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:04,291
I never told anyone.
I don't know who else she spoke to.

14
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:06,791
So why do you think
the whole family is involved?

15
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:08,375
I mean, a lot of things.

16
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:13,000
-Like?
-Like...

17
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:20,458
Greer makes anyone who spends any
significant time at the house sign an NDA.

18
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:26,833
And this other girl that Tag was seeing,
she tried to kill herself a few years ago

19
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:28,291
and no one talks about it.

20
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,250
And Benji, he...

21
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:34,208
he gets really defensive, like,
whenever I ask him about it.

22
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:35,791
Wouldn't you? I mean...

23
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:40,333
If your fiancé thought your whole family
was colluding to cover up a murder.

24
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:45,625
We found the kids and they're fine.

25
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:47,375
-Oh!
-Coast Guard called it in.

26
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:48,625
They're bringing them in now.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,875
- Hello?
<i>- We found Will, Mrs. Winbury.</i>

28
00:01:57,958 --> 00:01:58,875
Oh!

29
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:01,041
<i>-He's fine, they both are.</i>
-Oh.

30
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:02,166
Great.

31
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,333
<i>They're just looking him over
at the hospital.</i>

32
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,833
Thanks so much.

33
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:08,000
<i>Once they're done, I'll bring him home.</i>

<i>Miss Sacks,</i>

44
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,166
is there anything about Merritt
you haven't told us?

45
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,208
Anything Merritt might have known
that somebody wouldn't...

46
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:53,291
Like what?

47
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,041
No. No.

48
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:57,875
No.

49
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:01,875
What about Shooter Dival?

50
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:08,875
Do you have a feeling
that he might be involved as well?

51
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:10,458
No.

52
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:13,958
Do you have any idea
why he would try to get on the ferry

53
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:17,375
when we gave very clear orders
that no one was to leave the island?

54
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,041
Miss Sacks?

55
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,083
Uh...

56
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:24,958
Miss Sacks?

57
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:36,333
-Good afternoon, ma'am.
-Hi.

58
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,166
-Careful.
-Thanks.

59
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:44,750
About ready to go out.

60
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:47,333
- How much longer till takeoff?
- Uh, 15.

61
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,791
All set back there?

62
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,125
I don't understand
how you can memorize...

63
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,250
Hey.

64
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,166
Shooter. Dival.

65
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:08,375
-Amelia Sacks. Nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

66
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,000
Uh, is Benji not here yet?

67
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,500
Uh, no. His meeting got pushed
to this afternoon,

68
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,416
so he said he'd meet us there later.

69
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,500
Oh!

70
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:20,541
Oh!

71
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,000
Okay.

72
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:25,541
Um...

73
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:29,791
Let me.

74
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:37,458
Thanks.

75
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:39,375
First time?

76
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:40,833
Sorry?

77
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:42,250
Is it your first time?

78
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:45,000
On a private plane?

79
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:47,041
On Nantucket.

80
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,166
It's probably old hat to you.
You've been there a ton.

81
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:59,000
I have been there a ton,
but it'll never be old hat.

82
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,916
Hmm.

83
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,208
Have we met before?

84
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,625
I don't think so.

85
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,625
Maybe on the train or something?
Metro-North?

86
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:19,208
No.

87
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:30,083
Okay.

88
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:35,416
-Ooh! It's freezing in here.
-Yeah.

89
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:40,375
We're supposed to open the house
for the season and no one shows.

90
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:42,041
Benji texted.

91
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:46,583
He said he got the dates wrong
and the staff comes next weekend.

92
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,750
Bet the heat goes on next weekend too.

93
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,916
Yeah, well, he said he was coming.

94
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,250
That we should make ourselves at home.

95
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,958
Yeah, he'll be here in five hours.

96
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:01,208
Hey. Come on.
Let me show you the best part.

97
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:12,375
This is gorgeous.

98
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,166
And we don't need a staff to enjoy it.

99
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,625
No one needs a staff.

100
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:19,666
Fair enough.

101
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,166
So when was your first time here?

102
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,083
Summer after my mom died.

103
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,250
-When did she...
-When I was 14...

104
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:34,583
Benji and I were roommates at Deerfield.

105
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,458
And he knew I didn't want to go home,
so he invited me here.

106
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:41,458
-For the whole summer?
-Yeah.

107
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:45,166
He, uh, likes to help people.

108
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,500
He does.

109
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:55,958
He, uh...

110
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,291
told me your mom's really sick.

111
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,208
Yeah.

112
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,666
Yeah, I'm sorry.

113
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:12,458
Thank you.

114
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:18,916
Okay.

115
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,125
Okay.

116
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,250
What are you doing?

117
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:34,833
It's freezing! You're crazy!

118
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:36,583
Turn around.

119
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:41,375
Are you actually gonna go in?

120
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:43,208
Bye!

121
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,875
No, don't!

122
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,458
What are you doing?!

123
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:49,458
Come on in!

124
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:52,000
Come on! The water's amazing!

125
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:55,166
-Come on! Just in and out! Come on!
-I'm not going, it's so...

126
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,500
Just in and out!

127
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:58,708
Come on.

128
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,458
It's so cold!

129
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:08,833
Come on!

130
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,333
Why would he try to leave?

131
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:15,291
Uh...

132
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,166
-You tell me.
-I don't know.

133
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,625
Why are you asking me? You should ask him.

134
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:22,750
We did.

135
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,416
How well do you know Mr. Dival?

136
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:29,708
'Cause that guy has
a lot of powerful people on speed dial.

137
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:41,000
- When did this happen?
- Like two days ago.

138
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:42,625
You really should've seen us sooner.

139
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:43,708
Yeah, I know.

140
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,750
Thanks.

141
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,291
Can I have the room?

142
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,916
Here's what I want to know, Will.

143
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,333
I want to know how you could be so stupid
taking my daughter out in that storm.

144
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:58,958
The two of you could've been killed.

145
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,041
I'm... I'm really sorry...

146
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:05,833
No, "sorry" is not gonna be good enough
if anything ever happens to Chloe.

147
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:06,833
You understand me?

148
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:11,458
If you ever endanger her again
or hurt her in any way,

149
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,916
I'm gonna make you sorrier
than you ever thought possible.

150
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,791
You understand me? You got me?

151
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:17,791
Yeah, I got you.

152
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,083
Okay.

153
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,333
Why did you have
Merritt Monaco's bracelet?

154
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,083
-I can't tell you that.
-Why not?

155
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:49,500
Because someone could get hurt.

156
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,583
Someone has already gotten hurt.

157
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,291
A woman is dead, Will.

158
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:55,916
All right? Merritt is dead.

159
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:00,583
Do...

160
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,541
Do you know what happened to Merritt?

161
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:05,583
I mean were you there?

162
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,416
-Are... Are you...
-I'm pregnant.

163
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:16,500
Baby, that's beautiful.

164
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,166
-Really?
-Really.

165
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:21,916
You all right?

166
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,708
- Love you so, so much.
- Love you!

167
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,958
Congrats!

168
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:32,541
Merritt! Merritt!

169
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:35,250
-What are you doing out here?
-I saw you on the beach with my dad.

170
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,583
-He's never gonna leave my mom for you.
-What? Whoa.

171
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,666
It's not gonna happen.
He will never leave her.

172
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,916
Okay. Shh. Calm down.

173
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,208
He might have to.

174
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:50,000
I told her I would help her with the baby,
you know, if that's what she needed.

175
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:54,208
I... I'm getting my trust in a month,
so I'm gonna have money.

176
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:55,458
-I can handle it.
-Okay.

177
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:59,833
-You have to listen to me and trust me.
-It's going to be okay. I promise.

178
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:02,875
Don't worry.
This is not your problem to fix.

179
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:05,083
-I can give you money.
-It's not about the money.

180
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,750
- <i>What about the bracelet?</i>
- It's gonna be okay. I promise.

181
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:12,958
I found...

182
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,708
I found the bracelet
on the beach that night.

183
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,000
She... She dropped it in the sand.

184
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,291
Wait. She dropped it?

185
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,625
I swear to God,
I'm not bullshitting you. I...

186
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:27,666
<i>I knew she'd want it back, you know?
It's a fucking expensive thing.</i>

187
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,458
<i>It's got diamonds in it. So I...</i>

188
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,333
<i>I wanted to bring it back to her.</i>

189
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:45,041
<i>And what about your hand, Will?</i>

190
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,166
<i>My hand. That...</i>

191
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,291
<i>That was... It was just an accident.</i>

192
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,083
Ow!

193
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:58,166
Fuck!

194
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,041
What the hell? Will!

195
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,666
-Oh, shit. Are you okay?
-Ow!

196
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:06,583
Jesus.
It's okay. It's okay.

197
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:11,583
And I really didn't want my mom
to find out.

198
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:17,083
You're sure your mom didn't know already?

199
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
No.

200
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:39,166
Mom!

201
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,416
Oh. Is he here?

202
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,875
Your favorite son's home.

203
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:47,375
- William?
- Oh, my God. Thank God.

204
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:50,291
-Way to scare the fuck out of everybody.
-Fuck you, okay?

205
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,500
-Are you okay? Look at me.
-Yeah.

206
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,458
Thank you, Chief Carter,
for bringing him home.

207
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,958
- Yeah. Thank you.
- You're welcome. Get some rest.

208
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:59,416
What the hell were you thinking?

209
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,666
-Huh?
-I don't know.

210
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,916
No. What were you thinking,
taking that girl out in the storm?

211
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:06,875
Hello.

212
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,500
<i>Hello. Can I speak
to Greer Winbury, please?</i>

213
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:13,208
-Who's calling?
<i>-Tell her it's Broderick. She will know.</i>

214
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:16,833
-Can I tell her what this is regarding?
<i>-She'll, uh, know that too.</i>

215
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:20,666
Well, she's in the other room
with her husband,

216
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:24,333
so shall I call out loudly
that Broderick is on the phone?

217
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:27,708
Or I could pass her a note discreetly.

218
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,250
-What did he say to you?
-Who?

219
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:31,333
Chief Carter.

220
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,666
-Nothing.
-Did he ask you about your hard drive?

221
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,791
Tom, I swear, if you don't...

222
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,916
- He was asking about the boat.
- Look at me.

223
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,125
I took his daughter on the boat
in the storm.

224
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:42,833
-He was pissed off.
-Don't get worked up.

225
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,791
What else?
It was the fucking boat and his daughter.

226
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,833
And that was totally irresponsible.

227
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:52,250
And you're apologizing to her.
That was wrong.

228
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:55,750
-Greer, there's a Broderick on the phone?
-You're calling Chloe... What?

229
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:57,458
Broderick Graham.

230
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:00,625
No.

231
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,625
I don't know him.
No, I've never heard of him.

232
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,416
Tell him
no one should be calling this house.

233
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,208
We'll get you a fresh diaper, buddy.

234
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:14,458
Drop dead, dickhead!

235
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:19,958
She's not available at the moment,

236
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:23,500
but I'll let her know you called
her home number on a holiday weekend. Bye!

237
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:37,666
Nice.

238
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:28,541
Come in.

239
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:36,583
Why'd you try to get on the ferry?
Where were you going?

240
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,791
I panicked, okay?

241
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,250
I didn't know what else to do.

242
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,541
They kept asking me
about all kinds of stuff.

243
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,333
What stuff? Is it about Benji?

244
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:48,458
Benji?

245
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:51,458
-No.
-Then what stuff are you talking about?

246
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:52,541
It's just a money thing.

247
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:55,500
It has nothing to do with Merritt, okay?
That much I know.

248
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,500
Jesus Christ. This fucking family!

249
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,791
Will had her bracelet.

250
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,791
And I found pictures of her.

251
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:08,291
Pictures and...
And drawings in Benji's room.

252
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,125
A whole stack of them just of her.

253
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,500
Okay, I'm sure there's good reason for it.

254
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,625
Amelia,

255
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,750
Benji loves you.

256
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:21,416
He wouldn't hurt Merritt.

257
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:24,041
And he'd definitely never hurt you.

258
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:27,125
I have to go.

259
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:44,291
Hey.

260
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,791
So, me and Shooter are going for a run.

261
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:53,083
I have to ask you something.

262
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:55,208
Okay. Sure. What's up?

263
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,375
Why do you have these?

264
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,708
-It's...
-Benji, why?

265
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:11,750
It's stupid.

266
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,041
Merritt gave them to me.

267
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:16,833
She wanted me to paint her.

268
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:20,541
She saw the one I did of you,
and she loved it.

269
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:25,708
She was gonna post it, you know,
tag me or whatever.

270
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,125
Well, why didn't you tell me?

271
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:31,916
I... I didn't want to spoil the surprise.

272
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:33,666
And then when she...

273
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,791
I hid them.

274
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,791
I didn't want you to see them
and get upset.

275
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,000
Why did you think I had them?

276
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:01,208
When did you find out?

277
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,541
About Merritt and your dad?

278
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:11,000
Um...

279
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:14,541
That golf weekend. I...

280
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:15,791
All right.

281
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:19,500
<i>I swung by the house,
and they were just there.</i>

282
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:21,208
<i>By the pool.</i>

283
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:24,541
<i>I told her to stop it.</i>

284
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,166
<i>I wanted her to stop it.</i>

285
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,583
<i>I mean, he wasn't going to.</i>

286
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:31,833
<i>And then,</i>

287
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:35,166
<i>I was waiting for her to... To do it.</i>

288
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,458
<i>But she... She wouldn't answer my calls.</i>

289
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,416
Well, she probably couldn't stop it.

290
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:50,875
Not after she found out she was pregnant.

291
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:59,333
I... I did promise her
I wasn't gonna tell you.

292
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,375
The truth is, I didn't want you to know.

293
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:08,875
My dad is such an asshole,
but I'm nothing like him.

294
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:12,041
Amelia, I... I swear, I'm not.

295
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,125
I'm not.

296
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,250
I love you so fucking much.

297
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,541
No more secrets, okay? I promise.

298
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:44,875
"Cherry wood-smoked oysters with honey."

299
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,333
Who knew?

300
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,500
Rich people keep
all the good shit to themselves.

301
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:57,291
My mom does honey-and-mustard sandwiches,
but I think that's more of a budget thing.

302
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,291
My mom used to love
the bright yellow stuff.

303
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,208
It used to be
really hard to find in Mumbai.

304
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,458
You sure we haven't met before?

305
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,000
Before today?

306
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:23,083
No, I don't think so.

307
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,416
I'm thirsty. You thirsty?

308
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:33,458
Mmm-hmm.

309
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,291
Yeah, I could get used to this.

310
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,125
Probably shouldn't.

311
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:58,750
I don't really... match here.

312
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,041
What makes someone match here?

313
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:04,750
Money.

314
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:07,208
Having it.

315
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:11,125
Caring about who else has it.

316
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:14,458
Here, hang on.

317
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:21,416
{\an8}Dessert, <i>madame.</i>

318
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,458
{\an8}Ooh! Fancy.

319
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:25,541
The best.

320
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:32,125
-Do you remember the M&M commercials?
-Yes, I loved those commercials!

321
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,916
There used to be this one,
uh, with B.B. King.

322
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,041
-Yes! That was...
-It was...

323
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:39,500
-Shoot.
-No.

324
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:41,291
-Crap.
-Shit.

325
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:52,333
There you go. Over here too.

326
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:54,791
B train.

327
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:55,750
Huh?

328
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,791
Maybe three years ago?

329
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:01,708
It was Fourth of July weekend.

330
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:07,875
Okay. The train was packed.
It was just after the fireworks.

331
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:11,833
And this lady was selling
these plastic necklaces,

332
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:13,041
but her bag broke.

333
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:16,000
And the beads went flying everywhere.

334
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:19,708
And I got down trying to, like,
herd them around people's feet.

335
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,458
But just one other person helped.

336
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,375
It was this, uh...

337
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:31,583
It was this girl in a black band T-shirt.

338
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:35,125
That was you, wasn't it?

339
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:44,541
Hey.

340
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,625
-Hey.
-Amelia.

341
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:48,708
Oh, Benji! You made it.

342
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:52,333
Is that from Tag's stash?
That'll really piss him off.

343
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:56,541
-I approve.
-Good.

344
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:57,708
-Hey.
-Hey.

345
00:22:58,666 --> 00:23:00,083
-You good?
-Good, man.

346
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,125
-No more secrets.
-Okay.

347
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:14,416
Hang on, man.

348
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:16,125
So...

349
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,833
You know, I know what he did,

350
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,416
but it's always been really obvious
how much your dad loved your mom.

351
00:23:26,708 --> 00:23:28,125
Still does.

352
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:29,958
Which is really fucked up.

353
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:33,250
You know, I... I really think
he would die without her.

354
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:36,041
You know, I used to think it was,
like, heroic or something,

355
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:40,500
the way that she still loved him
despite of all his fucking fucking.

356
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:41,625
Uh, yeah.

357
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:46,791
But I could never look the other way
with Amelia. Like, never.

358
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:48,083
Huh.

359
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:55,583
Oh, fuck. No, man.
Can we walk the rest of this please?

360
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:09,625
- That's what this reminds me of.
- Yeah.

361
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,666
Dad, they can do the laundry.
You don't have to wash your socks.

362
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,000
Don't need anybody to help me.

363
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:16,583
- Tell the house keeper.
- No.

364
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:17,791
Don't need a housekeeper.

365
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:21,750
Honey, I just... I just don't want anyone
to do our laundry, but me or dad.

366
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:23,625
We like it that way.

367
00:24:23,708 --> 00:24:28,166
Do you remember that time Merritt shrank
that, like, it was an orange sweater?

368
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,875
-She nearly cried.
-It was a tiny, little...Oh, my God.

369
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:32,875
- She did cry.
- No!

370
00:24:32,958 --> 00:24:34,666
- She did?
- No, she didn't.

371
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:37,541
- Yeah.
- Oh, my gosh. I didn't care.

372
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:40,083
It was orange.
It wasn't even a good orange.

373
00:24:45,458 --> 00:24:48,625
-We loved having her, honey.
-She loved you guys.

374
00:24:48,708 --> 00:24:51,666
Some girlfriends, you know,
when you get engaged,

375
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:55,250
they're, like, just wondering,
"When's it going to be my turn?"

376
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:58,958
But she didn't have
any of that crap at all.

377
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:01,583
She was so thrilled for you.

378
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:05,500
She was happy when you were happy.

379
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:07,375
She was a good friend.

380
00:25:08,041 --> 00:25:09,625
And you were a good friend to her.

381
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:11,416
She was family.

382
00:25:13,958 --> 00:25:14,958
I know.

383
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:19,375
You know...

384
00:25:20,625 --> 00:25:22,708
You know, honey, you don't have to, uh,

385
00:25:22,791 --> 00:25:26,416
if you don't want to wait too long,
it doesn't have to be a big wedding.

386
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,333
Mama.

387
00:25:28,916 --> 00:25:31,166
-Think. There's no rush.
-Yeah, but it could be...

388
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,583
Mama.

389
00:25:35,916 --> 00:25:36,916
I love you.

390
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:53,208
- Love you, baby.
- Dad, I love you.

391
00:25:56,166 --> 00:25:59,458
Hey. You need to get some rest, hon.

392
00:26:39,125 --> 00:26:40,125
I'm working.

393
00:26:42,958 --> 00:26:43,958
I can see that.

394
00:26:48,291 --> 00:26:50,500
I need to finish these remarks
for tomorrow.

395
00:26:51,541 --> 00:26:52,708
Hmm.

396
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,958
Nice day for a paddle.

397
00:27:07,541 --> 00:27:09,250
Come on, Tag. Stop it.

398
00:27:10,666 --> 00:27:11,666
Stop what?

399
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,666
You know. I have a book launch tomorrow.

400
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:19,958
We have a house full of guests.
I don't have time for you right now.

401
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:22,541
We have a son upstairs
who doesn't even talk to us.

402
00:27:26,916 --> 00:27:29,833
You want me to tell them all to leave?
I don't give a fuck.

403
00:27:36,208 --> 00:27:38,666
-What do you want?
-You want to talk about it?

404
00:27:42,708 --> 00:27:45,000
Not really. No.

405
00:27:45,083 --> 00:27:46,083
You want to hit me?

406
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:51,625
You want to yell?

407
00:27:53,541 --> 00:27:54,666
Is that what you want?

408
00:27:55,416 --> 00:27:56,666
Hmm?

409
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,375
You want me to hit you, do you?

410
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:03,291
Do you want me to yell at you?
Because I can yell.

411
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,666
Everybody can hear us!

412
00:28:08,166 --> 00:28:09,250
Do you want that?

413
00:28:10,166 --> 00:28:11,541
Really? Now?

414
00:28:12,166 --> 00:28:13,541
Let's go.

415
00:28:18,541 --> 00:28:19,750
I want you back.

416
00:28:25,916 --> 00:28:27,083
It's all I ever wanted.

417
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,208
I love you.

418
00:28:34,416 --> 00:28:35,833
I always have.

419
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:40,958
Nothing's changed.

420
00:28:50,375 --> 00:28:51,708
Everything's changed.

421
00:29:06,875 --> 00:29:08,583
Mmm-mmm. Don't.

422
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:12,958
Don't touch me.

423
00:29:24,583 --> 00:29:26,291
I said don't touch me.

424
00:29:28,541 --> 00:29:30,375
I can't control myself.

425
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,125
I never could.

426
00:29:59,458 --> 00:30:00,333
Okay.

427
00:30:07,875 --> 00:30:09,125
That feels good.

428
00:30:10,416 --> 00:30:11,708
That feels good.

429
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:18,583
That feels...

430
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,625
<i>You, you make friends everywhere.</i>

431
00:30:54,708 --> 00:30:56,916
Friends and fans.

432
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I don't know about that.

433
00:30:59,083 --> 00:31:00,416
Oh, it's fairly obvious.

434
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,541
Hmm.

435
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:04,916
No matter what he said to you,

436
00:31:05,791 --> 00:31:06,791
he's lying.

437
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:11,250
Trust me.

438
00:31:11,958 --> 00:31:13,125
You're one of many.

439
00:31:17,791 --> 00:31:19,708
-Thank you, Abby.
-You're welcome.

440
00:31:20,416 --> 00:31:23,750
Isn't she pretty? So young. So pretty.

441
00:31:25,208 --> 00:31:27,458
Trust me, you'll find someone of your own.

442
00:31:29,958 --> 00:31:31,958
Cheers.

443
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:36,833
Are you not drinking?

444
00:31:36,916 --> 00:31:41,125
Um, yeah, I think... I think I should
get some dessert, like you said.

445
00:31:41,708 --> 00:31:44,083
It's going to go straight to my head.
Excuse me.

446
00:31:46,208 --> 00:31:50,958
That is not a dress.
She's wearing a bathing suit.

447
00:31:51,041 --> 00:31:52,375
Hmm.

448
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:18,041
Hmm.

449
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:53,541
Uh...

450
00:32:53,625 --> 00:32:55,291
What are you doing?

451
00:32:56,791 --> 00:32:58,083
We're hungry.

452
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:00,375
Um...

453
00:33:00,458 --> 00:33:03,125
we're going to eat some food.

454
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Right, yeah.

455
00:33:07,083 --> 00:33:09,875
Uh, well, you're not eating that, so...

456
00:33:13,833 --> 00:33:17,875
Well, what are you going to do, Benji,
put it in a fucking museum?

457
00:33:18,583 --> 00:33:20,625
My blood sugar's dangerously low.

458
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Just put it down.

459
00:33:25,791 --> 00:33:27,833
Or what?

460
00:33:28,666 --> 00:33:31,333
Just put the fucking cake down.

461
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:34,958
What, my pregnant wife
can't have some cake?

462
00:33:36,291 --> 00:33:37,791
Are you saying Abby's fat?

463
00:33:40,083 --> 00:33:40,916
Uh...

464
00:33:45,166 --> 00:33:46,166
Why?

465
00:33:48,541 --> 00:33:51,916
Thomas, put the fucking cake down,
or I'll shove it up your ass.

466
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,666
Oh, yeah?

467
00:33:56,333 --> 00:33:57,333
Do it.

468
00:34:00,416 --> 00:34:02,875
Shove it up my ass, daddy.

469
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,166
Oh, yeah! Fucking yeah!

470
00:34:05,791 --> 00:34:08,000
Shove it up my ass, daddy. Yeah!

471
00:34:09,291 --> 00:34:12,333
You want to eat the fucking cake, huh?
You want to eat the fucking cake?

472
00:34:12,416 --> 00:34:14,958
Huh? You want to eat it?
Eat the fucking cake then!

473
00:34:15,041 --> 00:34:16,500
- Eat it all!
- What the fuck?!

474
00:34:19,708 --> 00:34:21,208
You wanna fucking go, bro?

475
00:34:22,958 --> 00:34:24,458
Bro, you wanna fucking go?

476
00:34:29,791 --> 00:34:31,500
Okay, stop!

477
00:34:31,583 --> 00:34:34,208
Stop. Stop! Enough. Tom!

478
00:34:34,833 --> 00:34:35,916
This is vintage!

479
00:34:40,958 --> 00:34:42,000
He started it.

480
00:34:42,083 --> 00:34:43,083
Debatable.

481
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:46,125
-Fuck you, dude.
-Fuck you. Asshole.

482
00:34:47,375 --> 00:34:48,375
I'm leaving.

483
00:34:53,375 --> 00:34:54,375
Gosia!

484
00:35:00,083 --> 00:35:01,083
Gosia!

485
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,166
{\an8}Stearic acid.
Tallow. Titanium dioxide.

486
00:35:30,916 --> 00:35:31,916
Chief Carter.

487
00:35:33,166 --> 00:35:35,625
-Uh...
-Mrs. Winbury. Uh...

488
00:35:35,708 --> 00:35:37,791
-I've never seen you in here before.
-No.

489
00:35:37,875 --> 00:35:40,750
They said you'd be here, so I thought, um...

490
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,375
-I hope I'm not disturbing you.
-No, no, please, sit down.

491
00:35:44,458 --> 00:35:46,625
I'm sorry. Would you like a drink?

492
00:35:46,708 --> 00:35:48,416
Uh... no, I'm fine.

493
00:35:50,083 --> 00:35:52,333
I just, um... How is Chloe?

494
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:54,541
Oh, um...

495
00:35:54,625 --> 00:35:56,250
She's good, considering.

496
00:35:57,958 --> 00:36:01,500
I wanted to apologize on behalf of Will.
He feels terrible.

497
00:36:01,583 --> 00:36:04,541
I mean,
we've all been under so much stress

498
00:36:04,625 --> 00:36:06,458
with all of the recent events. It's...

499
00:36:06,541 --> 00:36:08,291
-I understand. Thank you.
-Hmm.

500
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:10,125
Thank you, I appreciate it.

501
00:36:10,875 --> 00:36:12,333
So what's that?

502
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:15,166
It's a preliminary toxicology report.

503
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:18,708
I have a medical-examiner friend
who works out of Boston.

504
00:36:18,791 --> 00:36:21,541
She consults on a lot of my books, so...

505
00:36:21,625 --> 00:36:24,666
Yeah, well, um,
Miss Monaco had a heavy dose

506
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,333
of barbiturates in her system.

507
00:36:26,416 --> 00:36:27,250
Huh.

508
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:28,958
Doesn't sound good.

509
00:36:31,291 --> 00:36:32,291
I'm...

510
00:36:33,166 --> 00:36:37,583
I'm assuming that you are not here
for the atmosphere, Mrs. Winbury.

511
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:39,250
Oh, I don't know.

512
00:36:41,916 --> 00:36:43,250
I wanted to give you something.

513
00:36:43,333 --> 00:36:47,125
My husband's been looking for it,
and I just thought you should have it.

514
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:53,500
It's a receipt for a piece of jewelry,
a bracelet, that he bought Miss Monaco.

515
00:37:01,625 --> 00:37:02,625
Thank you.

516
00:37:04,166 --> 00:37:05,416
My pleasure.

517
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:09,416
Believe it or not, I do want
the guilty party brought to justice, so...

518
00:37:14,541 --> 00:37:17,250
Uh, are you sure I can't get you a drink?

519
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:20,416
No, thank you.

520
00:37:51,916 --> 00:37:52,750
<i>Benji!</i>

521
00:37:56,791 --> 00:37:57,791
I'm coming in!

522
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:06,250
Sorry.

523
00:38:08,375 --> 00:38:09,666
Sorry.

524
00:38:31,625 --> 00:38:33,041
I haven't been fair to you.

525
00:38:35,541 --> 00:38:38,583
In another life,
we would have been...

526
00:38:43,208 --> 00:38:46,500
We would have been, done something,
but we didn't, we can't.

527
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:50,000
Look me in the eye
and tell me you don't want this,

528
00:38:50,083 --> 00:38:51,208
and I'll go right now.

529
00:38:58,666 --> 00:38:59,916
I don't want this.

530
00:39:16,666 --> 00:39:19,083
Dan. Detective.

531
00:39:19,166 --> 00:39:21,041
We need to talk to you
down at the station.

532
00:39:22,916 --> 00:39:25,750
Sure. Tell Mom I should be home by supper.

533
00:39:43,583 --> 00:39:44,583
Fuck!
