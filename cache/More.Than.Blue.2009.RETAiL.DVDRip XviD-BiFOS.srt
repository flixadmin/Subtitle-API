5
00:00:53,644 --> 00:00:55,737
Hey, Jung-sik?

6
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:56,981
How is it?

7
00:00:56,981 --> 00:00:58,516
What do you think.

8
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:00,851
I need it for the drama next week

9
00:01:00,851 --> 00:01:02,286
so tell him it's great!

10
00:01:02,286 --> 00:01:04,121
Like Seung-chul ever listens to me.

11
00:01:04,121 --> 00:01:07,424
Then make him. He's gotta do this song.

12
00:01:07,424 --> 00:01:10,723
But the lyrics are weak, man.

13
00:01:10,861 --> 00:01:13,330
What the suits say goes. That's show biz.

14
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:15,321
Whatever, man!

15
00:01:15,499 --> 00:01:17,201
-Hold up!
-What is it?

16
00:01:17,201 --> 00:01:18,335
You like this song?

17
00:01:18,335 --> 00:01:19,570
Of course! Why?

18
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:23,174
Singing about a girl to
come back to me at my age?

19
00:01:23,174 --> 00:01:25,876
My heart this and tears that...

20
00:01:25,876 --> 00:01:26,877
Isn't it childish?

21
00:01:26,877 --> 00:01:30,147
No! It's perfect! Don't you think?

22
00:01:30,147 --> 00:01:30,848
It's great.

23
00:01:30,848 --> 00:01:33,083
Make your fans really
feel the song, man!

24
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:35,085
But I don't feel anything!

25
00:01:35,085 --> 00:01:38,789
You can do it, man. Feel me?

26
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:39,790
-It's great!
-No.

27
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,781
It's not working for me.

28
00:01:44,361 --> 00:01:46,197
Seung-chul! Come on!

29
00:01:46,197 --> 00:01:48,529
Get him!

30
00:01:48,632 --> 00:01:49,929
Seung-chul!

31
00:01:50,201 --> 00:01:51,600
Yes, director.

32
00:01:51,969 --> 00:01:53,402
I see.

33
00:01:54,672 --> 00:01:56,731
Next Tuesday?

34
00:01:57,875 --> 00:01:59,577
The song's a killer.

35
00:02:00,211 --> 00:02:03,441
Nothing but the best
from Lee Seung-chul.

36
00:02:03,847 --> 00:02:05,382
Of course.

37
00:02:06,317 --> 00:02:09,411
No problems whatsoever.

38
00:02:10,788 --> 00:02:13,357
Yes, sir. Take care.

39
00:02:16,093 --> 00:02:20,588
See? He's asking for
the song. Do it for me?

40
00:02:20,898 --> 00:02:24,268
You always do this to me.

41
00:02:24,268 --> 00:02:25,970
Please?

42
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:31,840
So get me a good song
and I'll sing it! Damn!

43
00:02:31,942 --> 00:02:33,911
What about 'Hee-ya'?

44
00:02:33,911 --> 00:02:35,546
'Hee-ya, please look at me.'

45
00:02:35,546 --> 00:02:37,181
Give me a break.

46
00:02:37,181 --> 00:02:39,817
That was a hit only cuz you sang it.

47
00:02:39,817 --> 00:02:42,353
Wanna hear this song I got?

48
00:02:42,353 --> 00:02:43,454
What is it?

49
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:45,856
It's off a flopped album.

50
00:02:45,856 --> 00:02:48,058
Forget it, kid!

51
00:02:48,058 --> 00:02:50,361
Let's hear it.

52
00:02:50,361 --> 00:02:52,625
Really? Turn it on.

53
00:02:54,698 --> 00:03:00,534
<i>To give you everything
and all my love...</i>

54
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:03,440
Who wrote this? The lyrics are great.

55
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,137
Really? Then let's ask
them to write our lyrics.

56
00:03:07,378 --> 00:03:08,746
Who wrote this?

57
00:03:08,746 --> 00:03:12,216
Not sure. I got this off someone.

58
00:03:12,216 --> 00:03:13,017
Who?

59
00:03:13,017 --> 00:03:15,552
Min-chul. He used to
work for Kim Gap-sik.

60
00:03:15,552 --> 00:03:17,782
Gap-sik? I know him well.

61
00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:22,825
Hey, didn't he leave the biz?

62
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,094
Who does your friend work for now?

63
00:03:24,094 --> 00:03:26,363
He left the biz, too.

64
00:03:26,363 --> 00:03:27,398
What does he do?

65
00:03:27,398 --> 00:03:29,593
He runs a cafe in Chung-pyung.

66
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:32,494
Wanna go over, Seung-chul?

67
00:03:32,636 --> 00:03:34,968
-Know where it is?
-Yes.

68
00:03:35,072 --> 00:03:35,773
Lead the way.

69
00:03:35,773 --> 00:03:38,333
<i>Directed by Won Tae-Yeon</i>

70
00:03:42,112 --> 00:03:43,204
Got the album?

71
00:03:43,314 --> 00:03:44,542
Ah, here.

72
00:03:47,184 --> 00:03:48,617
What's the title?

73
00:03:48,752 --> 00:03:50,515
It's the second track.

74
00:03:51,322 --> 00:03:53,085
Second track?

75
00:03:56,427 --> 00:04:00,631
'No one else like Thee' by Cream?

76
00:04:00,631 --> 00:04:02,030
What's her real name?

77
00:04:02,132 --> 00:04:06,967
I think it was Eun Won.
Yeah, that's it.

78
00:04:07,204 --> 00:04:08,967
Got her number?

79
00:04:09,606 --> 00:04:10,607
She's gone.

80
00:04:10,607 --> 00:04:12,910
Gone? To where?

81
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,579
Right after Kang Chul-kyu left...

82
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:19,743
Kang knows her well?

83
00:04:20,651 --> 00:04:24,712
Of course. He was
totally in love with her.

84
00:04:25,589 --> 00:04:28,217
Do you have Kang's number?

85
00:04:28,992 --> 00:04:30,857
-He died.
-He's dead?

86
00:04:30,928 --> 00:04:32,229
When?

87
00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:35,721
About a month after
he married off Eun Won.

88
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,864
Mr. Kang!

89
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:42,430
What was the name of his show?

90
00:04:42,539 --> 00:04:44,508
'Ugly Ducklings in Love'.

91
00:04:44,508 --> 00:04:46,844
Yeah, that's it!

92
00:04:46,844 --> 00:04:50,047
He married off the woman he loved?

93
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:52,914
-What does that mean?
-Well...

94
00:04:53,851 --> 00:04:57,150
Tell us what happened.

95
00:04:57,788 --> 00:05:00,518
It's a long story.

96
00:05:50,941 --> 00:05:52,238
Hi, Chul-kyu!

97
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:08,323
<i>Kang said he saw stars</i>

98
00:06:08,425 --> 00:06:09,693
<i>when he first met Cream.</i>

99
00:06:09,693 --> 00:06:11,684
Why you little punk!

100
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:20,136
<i>Like he'd been slapped
on the back of his head.</i>

101
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:23,362
<i>He said it was love
at first sight.</i>

102
00:06:24,274 --> 00:06:26,208
<i>Without even talking to her.</i>

103
00:06:27,311 --> 00:06:28,903
<i>I asked,</i>

104
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:31,877
<i>'Shouldn't you at least
say a few words, first? '</i>

105
00:06:32,049 --> 00:06:33,573
<i>Then he said...</i>

106
00:06:34,451 --> 00:06:38,478
<i>If you need words,
then how can mutes love?</i>

107
00:06:52,369 --> 00:06:55,806
How did you know my name?

108
00:06:55,806 --> 00:07:00,038
Isn't it a waste living
in this big place alone?

109
00:07:02,613 --> 00:07:04,843
Want me to live with you?

110
00:07:21,365 --> 00:07:25,502
Think of a name for me,
and I'll make one for you.

111
00:07:25,502 --> 00:07:27,595
We can't change our names.

112
00:07:28,472 --> 00:07:29,496
Why not?

113
00:07:29,573 --> 00:07:32,974
<i>Her name is Cream
and my name is Kay.</i>

114
00:07:33,143 --> 00:07:35,879
<i>She was cold like ice cream,</i>

115
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:38,682
<i>-but also sweet like ice cream.
-The curtains won't do.</i>

116
00:07:38,682 --> 00:07:39,883
We're changing everything.

117
00:07:39,883 --> 00:07:42,477
<i>And she was
soft like ice cream.</i>

118
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,787
<i>And I'm not A, B, C,
D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K...</i>

119
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:50,854
<i>But just Kay.</i>

120
00:08:04,675 --> 00:08:06,802
<i>We had a lot in common.</i>

121
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:11,237
<i>We were the same age.
We both liked noodles.</i>

122
00:08:13,216 --> 00:08:15,912
<i>We loved listening to
music on rainy days.</i>

123
00:08:17,621 --> 00:08:19,816
<i>We loved coffee.</i>

124
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:24,590
<i>We hated school.</i>

125
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:30,896
<i>She liked me.</i>

126
00:08:32,002 --> 00:08:33,902
<i>And I liked her.</i>

127
00:08:36,073 --> 00:08:37,973
<i>And we were both orphans.</i>

128
00:08:41,378 --> 00:08:43,413
<i>Prison and love...</i>

129
00:08:43,413 --> 00:08:46,280
<i>Once you're stuck,
you can't get out.</i>

130
00:08:50,887 --> 00:08:54,448
<i>I fell in love with Cream.</i>

131
00:08:57,427 --> 00:09:00,260
<i>Even the very air she breathed.</i>

132
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:09,670
<i>Romeo must've been so worried...</i>

133
00:09:09,906 --> 00:09:14,707
<i>Loving Juliet, but
afraid he might lose her.</i>

134
00:09:19,483 --> 00:09:22,884
<i>Why did he drink the poison?</i>

135
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,450
<i>Perhaps he knew.</i>

136
00:09:28,692 --> 00:09:31,261
<i>To love someone</i>

137
00:09:31,261 --> 00:09:33,491
<i>-is to give her everything.
-I'll visit often.</i>

138
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:43,000
<i>I received so much from her
like the catcher who gets the ball.</i>

139
00:09:44,508 --> 00:09:47,377
<i>Love was like dry ice.
Sometimes cold, sometimes hot.</i>

140
00:09:47,377 --> 00:09:48,435
Wait!

141
00:09:48,578 --> 00:09:50,375
<i>Cream was so loveable.</i>

142
00:09:51,948 --> 00:09:58,148
<i>But I couldn't tell her
that I loved her.</i>

143
00:09:59,556 --> 00:10:06,792
<i>Cuz I had cancer cells in me
ready to strike at any time.</i>

144
00:10:09,566 --> 00:10:15,300
<i>More Than Blue</i>

145
00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:54,277
Thank you, Mr. Kim.

146
00:10:54,277 --> 00:10:57,748
It's the least I can do.

147
00:10:57,748 --> 00:11:01,118
Writers need to eat well
to do all that thinking.

148
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:06,656
Have some soup with the
Kimbap and chew carefully.

149
00:11:06,656 --> 00:11:08,759
Is this your new singer?

150
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:15,187
Greet them, girl. They're
the best writers in SBC.

151
00:11:15,932 --> 00:11:20,504
Hello, I'm Cat Girl. I
promise to sing my heart out.

152
00:11:20,504 --> 00:11:22,699
Damn right you should.

153
00:11:23,206 --> 00:11:25,041
Great outfit.

154
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:28,135
It's a new concept. She's a cat.

155
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:30,447
It's Cat Girl.

156
00:11:30,447 --> 00:11:34,918
This gal's got brains.

157
00:11:34,918 --> 00:11:38,021
She's a student at Seoul University.

158
00:11:38,021 --> 00:11:39,682
Really?

159
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:43,026
It's Seoul University of Arts.

160
00:11:43,026 --> 00:11:45,051
Who's side are you on?

161
00:11:45,195 --> 00:11:47,831
You could get in trouble for
lying about schools these days.

162
00:11:47,831 --> 00:11:52,335
If you're so holy, go be a cop instead.

163
00:11:52,335 --> 00:11:53,393
Sorry.

164
00:11:56,706 --> 00:11:58,071
Mr. Kang!

165
00:11:58,175 --> 00:11:59,075
How are you?

166
00:11:59,075 --> 00:12:03,273
Here's Seung-chul's
new album. It's deep.

167
00:12:03,747 --> 00:12:06,883
-It's a sure hit.
-I'm sure it's great.

168
00:12:06,883 --> 00:12:07,951
-Say hi.
-Hello.

169
00:12:07,951 --> 00:12:09,213
Call me Kay.

170
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,588
Let's go for drinks some time.

171
00:12:11,588 --> 00:12:13,317
-Sounds great.
-Bye.

172
00:12:14,858 --> 00:12:17,194
Seoul Univ. of Arts. Same difference.

173
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,495
That's right.

174
00:12:18,495 --> 00:12:19,928
Did you eat, sir?

175
00:12:20,564 --> 00:12:21,932
Mr. Kang!

176
00:12:21,932 --> 00:12:24,234
-How've you been?
-I waited so long for you.

177
00:12:24,234 --> 00:12:27,904
She's Cats. Damn, I keep forgetting.

178
00:12:27,904 --> 00:12:29,997
It's Cat Girl, sir.

179
00:12:30,173 --> 00:12:33,904
Go on and introduce yourself, girl.

180
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:38,815
I'm Cat Girl. I promise
to sing my heart out.

181
00:12:38,815 --> 00:12:39,983
Thank you.

182
00:12:39,983 --> 00:12:42,645
Of course you should.

183
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:45,889
Let's go some place
quiet to talk, Mr. Kang.

184
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:48,221
See you folks later.

185
00:12:49,726 --> 00:12:53,029
-Come on, what are pals for.
-I can't.

186
00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:56,965
It's just a show of my appreciation.

187
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,768
The album's finished?

188
00:12:58,768 --> 00:13:02,472
I put together all the
best songwriters around.

189
00:13:02,472 --> 00:13:05,703
You know me, I get what I want.

190
00:13:06,042 --> 00:13:07,377
How is she?

191
00:13:07,377 --> 00:13:10,881
Oh, her? Not bad.

192
00:13:10,881 --> 00:13:14,885
But she has trouble getting
along with the others.

193
00:13:14,885 --> 00:13:17,220
Still she's got talent. Be nice.

194
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,815
Of course. Anything for you.

195
00:13:22,392 --> 00:13:25,061
-But do this for me.
-I can't.

196
00:13:25,061 --> 00:13:27,552
It's not much. Please, take it!

197
00:13:27,964 --> 00:13:34,804
I can't sleep at the thought of you.

198
00:13:34,804 --> 00:13:40,174
My dear love.

199
00:13:42,212 --> 00:13:47,684
That part you just sang. Try
not to scream it this time.

200
00:13:47,684 --> 00:13:49,675
You'll scare 'em off.

201
00:13:50,553 --> 00:13:53,317
How, sir?

202
00:13:54,591 --> 00:14:00,029
How would you feel if someone
screamed they loved you?

203
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:05,700
You know, softly and
tenderly? You're good at that.

204
00:14:05,802 --> 00:14:10,398
What? Not that. Stop making me do it.

205
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:15,136
-That's not what I meant!
-Roll it!

206
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:26,520
What's she so good at?

207
00:14:26,957 --> 00:14:30,518
Drop it will ya, man?

208
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,959
Come on. Just between us?

209
00:14:37,133 --> 00:14:42,400
She's my future. That's
all I can tell ya, man.

210
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:48,075
Did you fix the second verse?

211
00:14:48,211 --> 00:14:49,678
What?

212
00:14:50,013 --> 00:14:52,413
The climax on the second verse.

213
00:14:52,582 --> 00:14:54,846
'Always like yesterday'?

214
00:14:55,018 --> 00:14:58,112
It's a little corny, isn't it?

215
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:03,019
'A world without love? ' How's that?

216
00:15:05,996 --> 00:15:09,022
Like that's not corny?

217
00:15:11,568 --> 00:15:14,867
It's just a suggestion.

218
00:15:14,971 --> 00:15:21,968
Let's not get too excited here.

219
00:15:26,249 --> 00:15:29,616
You two write it, then. I'm out.

220
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,685
What?

221
00:15:36,092 --> 00:15:37,923
So feisty.

222
00:16:01,818 --> 00:16:03,683
Do you have to become a singer?

223
00:16:04,654 --> 00:16:06,178
What?

224
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:13,593
Got enough medication left?

225
00:16:27,677 --> 00:16:31,272
My damn connection to your family.

226
00:16:35,552 --> 00:16:38,612
First your father, now you.

227
00:16:40,423 --> 00:16:43,517
There are too many illnesses
that can't be cured.

228
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:03,776
What's wrong?

229
00:17:08,852 --> 00:17:10,149
What is it?

230
00:17:12,889 --> 00:17:14,356
Don't cry.

231
00:17:15,358 --> 00:17:16,882
Stop crying.

232
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:21,320
The bastards told me to rewrite it.

233
00:17:27,036 --> 00:17:31,029
'If I could live again'.
How's that for the title?

234
00:17:31,841 --> 00:17:34,173
'If I could live again? '

235
00:17:34,944 --> 00:17:40,177
If you could, what would
you like to be reborn as?

236
00:17:41,451 --> 00:17:43,316
Besides a person?

237
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,049
Anything.

238
00:17:48,324 --> 00:17:50,224
Well...

239
00:17:51,861 --> 00:17:54,125
If I could live again...

240
00:17:57,066 --> 00:17:58,368
A ring?

241
00:17:58,368 --> 00:17:59,767
Wait.

242
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,102
Start over.

243
00:18:11,648 --> 00:18:13,843
If I could be born again...

244
00:18:14,584 --> 00:18:16,415
A ring.

245
00:18:17,954 --> 00:18:19,512
A pair of glasses.

246
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:22,651
A bed.

247
00:18:24,427 --> 00:18:26,190
A diary.

248
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:29,832
Born again as things like
that? What fun is that?

249
00:18:29,832 --> 00:18:34,394
You can buy me. It'll
always be fun at your side.

250
00:18:36,239 --> 00:18:38,173
So sensible.

251
00:18:39,075 --> 00:18:40,599
Did you eat?

252
00:18:40,877 --> 00:18:42,504
Of course, I did.

253
00:18:43,513 --> 00:18:45,344
Well, I didn't.

254
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,281
Then let's eat.

255
00:18:54,224 --> 00:18:56,692
Is there anything you want to tell me?

256
00:18:57,093 --> 00:18:58,424
Like what?

257
00:18:58,761 --> 00:19:02,298
A deep, dark secret?

258
00:19:02,298 --> 00:19:06,564
Think of it as a confession
at a Catholic church.

259
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:10,366
I'll be the priest and listen.

260
00:19:11,341 --> 00:19:13,309
A deep, dark secret?

261
00:19:14,644 --> 00:19:17,914
Say anything. I'm ready to listen.

262
00:19:17,914 --> 00:19:19,541
I like you.

263
00:19:24,254 --> 00:19:26,688
I want to ask you something.

264
00:19:27,924 --> 00:19:29,619
Do you have a wish?

265
00:19:29,826 --> 00:19:31,418
A wish?

266
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:35,325
If you could have anything in the world?

267
00:19:36,199 --> 00:19:38,190
First, hold up your spoon.

268
00:19:42,538 --> 00:19:44,199
Then?

269
00:19:44,741 --> 00:19:46,902
Eat all your food.

270
00:19:55,785 --> 00:19:57,377
Then?

271
00:19:57,587 --> 00:19:59,885
Meet a great guy and get married.

272
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,353
Can't I marry you?

273
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,517
I'm not a great guy.

274
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:11,701
It wasn't my choice, but heaven's will,

275
00:20:11,701 --> 00:20:15,071
to fall in love with you.

276
00:20:15,071 --> 00:20:22,500
I was born to love you.
Heaven sent me to love you.

277
00:20:22,812 --> 00:20:24,905
ID: Little Mermaid.

278
00:20:25,048 --> 00:20:29,747
Now, for the requested song.

279
00:20:40,263 --> 00:20:43,858
Your second toe is longer
than the first one like mine.

280
00:20:44,634 --> 00:20:47,432
That means your mom will outlive you.

281
00:20:50,506 --> 00:20:52,167
Who says that?

282
00:20:54,344 --> 00:20:58,405
I think I read it somewhere.

283
00:20:58,881 --> 00:21:00,405
It's a lie.

284
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:02,278
Why?

285
00:21:02,285 --> 00:21:05,982
Cuz my Mom and Dad died on the same day.

286
00:21:09,192 --> 00:21:10,716
If you...

287
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,556
If you die before me, I'll kill you!

288
00:21:19,969 --> 00:21:24,429
<i>Here's another requested song.</i>

289
00:21:58,074 --> 00:21:59,837
Are you finished?

290
00:22:02,211 --> 00:22:03,803
Excuse me?

291
00:22:04,147 --> 00:22:05,637
The coffee.

292
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,654
Then can I have the cup?

293
00:22:38,381 --> 00:22:40,315
Which side did you drink from?

294
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:42,415
Pardon?

295
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,360
This isn't kissing, is it?

296
00:23:06,609 --> 00:23:09,442
-Hey.
-Yeah?

297
00:23:12,448 --> 00:23:16,578
-You know the guest doctor?
-Yeah?

298
00:23:18,054 --> 00:23:20,022
What kind of doctor is he?

299
00:23:21,657 --> 00:23:22,783
Huh?

300
00:23:27,663 --> 00:23:31,463
We need to fill a cavity.
Amalgam is stronger than resin.

301
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:39,672
We kiss on the first day.

302
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:48,316
You see inside me, on the second day.

303
00:23:54,257 --> 00:23:56,282
What should we do on the third day?

304
00:24:02,131 --> 00:24:03,564
What?

305
00:24:03,933 --> 00:24:07,596
We'll decide when the time comes.

306
00:24:16,612 --> 00:24:18,671
I'm in love!

307
00:24:20,116 --> 00:24:24,075
A guest on another show. He's a dentist.

308
00:24:30,226 --> 00:24:32,023
Pass me the toothbrush?

309
00:25:40,596 --> 00:25:43,499
You're listening to 'Happy Hour'.

310
00:25:43,499 --> 00:25:46,936
-As you're out driving...
-Did you eat?

311
00:25:46,936 --> 00:25:49,372
Oh, hi.

312
00:25:49,372 --> 00:25:52,000
-Got a show to record, today?
-No.

313
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:57,241
The guest doctor on your show...

314
00:25:57,446 --> 00:26:01,212
Who? You mean Cha Joo-hwan?

315
00:26:01,817 --> 00:26:03,285
How is he?

316
00:26:03,285 --> 00:26:06,379
He's a great guy. Why?

317
00:26:06,689 --> 00:26:09,725
Just wondering.

318
00:26:09,725 --> 00:26:15,925
His family's rich, he's nice,
and he makes a ton of money.

319
00:26:16,098 --> 00:26:18,965
And he's a famous dentist.

320
00:26:19,568 --> 00:26:22,435
You look a little sad today.

321
00:26:22,972 --> 00:26:25,241
Good job, bro.

322
00:26:25,241 --> 00:26:27,009
It was fun.

323
00:26:27,009 --> 00:26:30,746
-Great show.
-Cut it short.

324
00:26:30,746 --> 00:26:33,306
Hey, nice seeing you.

325
00:26:33,382 --> 00:26:35,284
Let's go out for drinks.

326
00:26:35,284 --> 00:26:37,687
Not if it's just a few drinks.

327
00:26:37,687 --> 00:26:41,646
-How much then?
-All night?

328
00:26:41,791 --> 00:26:43,224
All night! Alright!

329
00:26:45,194 --> 00:26:47,162
<i>What's his social
security number?</i>

330
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:51,400
<i>-730313105...
-730313...</i>

331
00:26:53,803 --> 00:26:56,205
Sure you can get his medical records?

332
00:26:56,205 --> 00:26:58,765
<i>Insurance companies
get everything.</i>

333
00:26:58,874 --> 00:27:01,243
<i>But why do you want
to check out a guy?</i>

334
00:27:01,243 --> 00:27:02,945
I'll tell you later.

335
00:27:02,945 --> 00:27:08,440
<i>Bingo! He's got life
and medical insurance.</i>

336
00:27:08,551 --> 00:27:11,987
<i>No record of family illness
or any operations.</i>

337
00:27:11,987 --> 00:27:15,858
<i>He has an impeccable
health record.</i>

338
00:27:15,858 --> 00:27:17,193
You sure?

339
00:27:17,193 --> 00:27:19,595
<i>Insurance companies know
how to make money, man.</i>

340
00:27:19,595 --> 00:27:20,362
Kang!

341
00:27:20,362 --> 00:27:22,865
<i>If he has a hospital
record, we'll see it.</i>

342
00:27:22,865 --> 00:27:23,899
Kang!

343
00:27:23,899 --> 00:27:25,764
Thanks. I owe you one.

344
00:27:28,304 --> 00:27:30,005
Got a minute Mr. Kim?

345
00:27:30,005 --> 00:27:32,872
For you, any time!

346
00:27:38,647 --> 00:27:40,137
It's a gift.

347
00:27:43,452 --> 00:27:46,353
Ah, thank you.

348
00:27:47,223 --> 00:27:49,384
Just a thank you?

349
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:55,658
First my lips, then my insides...

350
00:27:56,198 --> 00:27:58,826
Now, you're in my head.

351
00:27:59,401 --> 00:28:01,266
Buy me a drink?

352
00:28:07,243 --> 00:28:08,642
A drink?

353
00:28:09,311 --> 00:28:12,576
I don't get it.

354
00:28:12,681 --> 00:28:20,053
Who would've thought I'd use my
former dark roots to help you?

355
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:25,594
No need to worry. Now about Cats.

356
00:28:26,629 --> 00:28:29,899
Man, I gotta change that name!

357
00:28:29,899 --> 00:28:31,867
It's Cat Girl, sir.

358
00:28:31,867 --> 00:28:37,032
I know! It's up here
but I can't say it right!

359
00:28:38,541 --> 00:28:41,043
Call me whatever you want, hon.

360
00:28:41,043 --> 00:28:43,807
Who cares if it's a cat or a dog?

361
00:28:44,113 --> 00:28:47,947
That's my pretty.

362
00:28:49,218 --> 00:28:51,118
My sweet Cats.

363
00:28:52,121 --> 00:28:55,090
We're changing the name.

364
00:28:56,826 --> 00:29:00,196
-Ah, sir?
-I said, I know!

365
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:02,391
Not that. The phone.

366
00:29:04,066 --> 00:29:07,832
Sorry, Producer Kang! I checked and...

367
00:29:09,371 --> 00:29:12,738
You kids scram for a sec.

368
00:29:13,742 --> 00:29:16,336
I gotta take this call. Go!

369
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:23,919
Cha Joo-hwan's family's loaded!

370
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:27,523
He even has a hot fiancé.

371
00:29:27,523 --> 00:29:30,890
He's got it made.

372
00:29:31,093 --> 00:29:32,294
<i>Fiancé?</i>

373
00:29:32,294 --> 00:29:35,195
Is something up?

374
00:29:41,103 --> 00:29:44,766
Oh, you dropped your candy.

375
00:29:45,941 --> 00:29:48,000
Let's put it in your pocket.

376
00:30:01,023 --> 00:30:03,116
Have you ever been in love?

377
00:30:05,194 --> 00:30:08,357
Like a rock thrown into the river.

378
00:30:12,801 --> 00:30:14,393
Give me the ring.

379
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:15,828
Excuse me?

380
00:30:15,938 --> 00:30:17,599
Your ring.

381
00:30:31,987 --> 00:30:33,750
Like this.

382
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:51,834
Someone to pull you out. Like this.

383
00:30:54,243 --> 00:30:56,473
I'm engaged.

384
00:31:06,422 --> 00:31:08,219
It doesn't matter.

385
00:31:08,524 --> 00:31:09,786
Let's keep drinking.

386
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,893
It's so cold.

387
00:31:23,572 --> 00:31:25,540
Did you drink?

388
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:38,408
What do you like so much about him?

389
00:31:40,723 --> 00:31:43,590
I feel like I'm being sterilized.

390
00:31:46,328 --> 00:31:48,421
Sterilized?

391
00:31:49,965 --> 00:31:51,489
Sterilized.

392
00:32:27,036 --> 00:32:28,264
Perfect.

393
00:32:41,183 --> 00:32:44,118
-Let's eat.
-Sorry, I gotta run.

394
00:32:45,354 --> 00:32:47,982
-You're not eating?
-I can't.

395
00:32:48,223 --> 00:32:50,214
What about all this food?

396
00:32:50,726 --> 00:32:52,193
You eat it all.

397
00:32:55,097 --> 00:32:56,587
I'll see you later.

398
00:33:20,022 --> 00:33:25,971
A, B, C, D, E, F, G...

399
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,112
...H, I, J, K

400
00:34:06,702 --> 00:34:08,397
Hello?

401
00:34:08,804 --> 00:34:11,673
<i>Is this Eun Won's number?</i>

402
00:34:11,673 --> 00:34:15,370
Yes, it is.

403
00:34:15,811 --> 00:34:18,336
<i>May I speak to her, please?</i>

404
00:34:18,547 --> 00:34:20,344
She's not here.

405
00:34:22,751 --> 00:34:24,987
<i>My name's Cha Joo-hwan.</i>

406
00:34:24,987 --> 00:34:27,456
<i>We were supposed
to meet today</i>

407
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:31,660
<i>but something came
up at the clinic.</i>

408
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:34,396
<i>Is there any way
I can reach her?</i>

409
00:34:34,396 --> 00:34:36,830
Where were you going to meet?

410
00:35:19,374 --> 00:35:20,807
So cold.

411
00:35:22,477 --> 00:35:23,637
Hey.

412
00:35:23,712 --> 00:35:25,145
He can't come.

413
00:35:25,547 --> 00:35:26,775
Who?

414
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,338
Him.

415
00:35:32,087 --> 00:35:33,554
The doc.

416
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,661
Where are you going?

417
00:35:39,661 --> 00:35:41,322
I gotta go.

418
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:45,122
Sit down. The curry here is great.

419
00:35:47,236 --> 00:35:49,004
You know I don't eat curry.

420
00:35:49,004 --> 00:35:50,138
Then what do you want?

421
00:35:50,138 --> 00:35:51,273
What else is there?

422
00:35:51,273 --> 00:35:53,264
What do you want to eat?

423
00:35:54,276 --> 00:35:55,937
Kimbap.

424
00:35:56,979 --> 00:35:58,674
So boring.

425
00:35:58,847 --> 00:36:00,678
Just eat curry.

426
00:36:03,952 --> 00:36:05,476
You're buying.

427
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:12,754
Come on Producer Kang. Spill it.

428
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:15,192
Did he rip you off or something?

429
00:36:15,397 --> 00:36:18,833
Then, why didn't you say so!

430
00:36:19,568 --> 00:36:26,565
My boys can get the money
back before lunch in no time.

431
00:36:26,808 --> 00:36:28,332
It's not that.

432
00:36:28,443 --> 00:36:31,378
Then what is it?

433
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:37,177
Why would someone like you want
the dirt on some guy's fiancé even?

434
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:43,289
Are you interested in his fiancé?

435
00:36:43,892 --> 00:36:46,087
Just find out, please.

436
00:36:46,228 --> 00:36:47,855
Fine, then.

437
00:36:49,131 --> 00:36:55,331
Anyway, Cats' album's
startin' to get noticed, now.

438
00:36:55,904 --> 00:36:58,707
Let's cook up something with your show

439
00:36:58,707 --> 00:37:02,074
and sell 'em like hot pancakes!

440
00:37:02,878 --> 00:37:04,146
I'm sure it'll do well.

441
00:37:04,146 --> 00:37:05,909
Of course.

442
00:37:06,248 --> 00:37:07,613
Hey, Min-chul!

443
00:37:08,116 --> 00:37:09,811
Did you like the house?

444
00:37:10,252 --> 00:37:13,415
Mother said she liked it.

445
00:37:13,555 --> 00:37:15,455
It's not bad.

446
00:37:15,791 --> 00:37:18,021
I heard you stopped holding exhibitions.

447
00:37:18,593 --> 00:37:20,891
I'm tired of putting on shows.

448
00:37:22,597 --> 00:37:25,065
And there's nothing to take pictures of.

449
00:37:26,835 --> 00:37:32,102
I'm sorry I'm not more fun to be around.

450
00:37:32,274 --> 00:37:36,938
Don't worry. I like
to have fun by myself.

451
00:37:37,746 --> 00:37:39,441
That's sad.

452
00:37:40,749 --> 00:37:45,311
-Let's have fun together from now on.
-Sure.

453
00:37:46,621 --> 00:37:49,954
Can I get an ashtray here?

454
00:37:50,325 --> 00:37:53,226
I'm sorry. There's no smoking here.

455
00:37:54,863 --> 00:37:57,457
The world's such a bore.

456
00:37:57,566 --> 00:38:00,433
Get her an ashtray to
put that out, please.

457
00:38:00,535 --> 00:38:02,560
Yes, sir.

458
00:38:04,272 --> 00:38:05,899
Interesting.

459
00:38:06,241 --> 00:38:07,640
Keep smoking.

460
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:14,176
Should've known. She's
really somethin' all right.

461
00:38:14,883 --> 00:38:18,148
She's got men coming out of her ears.

462
00:38:18,453 --> 00:38:21,823
I told 'em to take some good pics.

463
00:38:21,823 --> 00:38:23,024
It won't be long.

464
00:38:23,024 --> 00:38:26,661
<i>How did you pose
for your album cover?</i>

465
00:38:26,661 --> 00:38:29,931
I posed like I practiced
with my boss last night.

466
00:38:29,931 --> 00:38:32,033
Exactly how?

467
00:38:32,033 --> 00:38:34,136
<i>-Here?
-Pardon?</i>

468
00:38:34,136 --> 00:38:37,697
Men are all the same.

469
00:38:39,107 --> 00:38:40,699
Okay, then.

470
00:38:43,011 --> 00:38:47,107
First, I open my eyes like a cat.

471
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:48,750
Like this.

472
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:51,319
-Ah, Cat Girl?
-Then...

473
00:38:51,319 --> 00:38:54,423
I hold my hands up and
open my mouth like this.

474
00:38:54,423 --> 00:38:57,392
Look at her. She's a natural born star!

475
00:38:57,392 --> 00:38:59,155
You can just tell us.

476
00:38:59,461 --> 00:39:02,063
But my boss said a star

477
00:39:02,063 --> 00:39:04,599
<i>-has to speak with the body.
-See that?</i>

478
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:10,038
Girls like her adjust so quickly.

479
00:39:10,038 --> 00:39:13,633
That foxy babe. Who wouldn't love her?

480
00:39:16,411 --> 00:39:19,080
-Ah, sir?
-Kang!

481
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,048
-What's wrong?
-Kang!

482
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:32,657
Where is he?

483
00:39:35,597 --> 00:39:37,656
-Hey!
-I'm dead beat.

484
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,494
What's wrong with you!

485
00:39:39,935 --> 00:39:41,459
What's with you!

486
00:39:43,004 --> 00:39:45,302
Don't start.

487
00:39:47,342 --> 00:39:51,142
Why does he keep fainting like this?

488
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:56,451
It's hereditary, but it could also be

489
00:39:56,451 --> 00:39:59,054
not enough calcium in his diet.

490
00:39:59,054 --> 00:40:05,760
We've been eating the same food
in the same house for years!

491
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,228
Why are you the only
one who keeps fainting!

492
00:40:10,332 --> 00:40:12,630
You eat way more than I do.

493
00:40:12,834 --> 00:40:17,100
You're only eating anchovies
from now on, got that!

494
00:40:36,157 --> 00:40:37,647
You!

495
00:40:38,193 --> 00:40:39,660
Yes?

496
00:40:39,761 --> 00:40:41,752
What did he just say?

497
00:40:43,164 --> 00:40:46,930
To break off your engagement...

498
00:40:48,103 --> 00:40:51,300
-Stop! Please!
-Who are you!

499
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:55,673
What the hell are you trying to pull!

500
00:40:58,179 --> 00:41:01,876
You don't wanna mess with me!

501
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:05,950
Get the hell out of my sight!

502
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,723
I said, get lost.

503
00:41:35,717 --> 00:41:37,878
Why are you doing this?

504
00:41:39,287 --> 00:41:40,811
Huh?

505
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:45,953
You're a successful radio show producer.

506
00:41:46,161 --> 00:41:49,528
Trailing a woman and
getting slapped like that.

507
00:41:50,765 --> 00:41:52,634
Aren't you embarrassed?

508
00:41:52,634 --> 00:41:55,102
I don't have time to be embarrassed.

509
00:41:56,504 --> 00:41:59,064
What are you talking about?

510
00:41:59,441 --> 00:42:04,208
One mountain after
another. But no time to go.

511
00:42:08,483 --> 00:42:10,644
Ow, my head.

512
00:42:13,121 --> 00:42:14,952
Does it hurt?

513
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:17,988
I'm hurt, too.

514
00:42:22,063 --> 00:42:24,327
What's with me today?

515
00:42:25,266 --> 00:42:27,257
It's cuz we're sad.

516
00:42:28,503 --> 00:42:33,497
Then cry instead of making jokes.

517
00:42:34,142 --> 00:42:36,372
I don't want to cry.

518
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:40,445
Don't wanna make someone cry even more.

519
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:49,254
I'm dying. Just like my dad.

520
00:42:52,894 --> 00:42:54,589
Chul-kyu!

521
00:43:00,168 --> 00:43:04,764
<i>Mom left me a year
after Dad died.</i>

522
00:43:08,276 --> 00:43:11,177
<i>It probably wasn't
cuz she resented me.</i>

523
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,605
<i>She was sick of
everything cuz of Dad.</i>

524
00:43:16,584 --> 00:43:21,317
<i>I understand. I was
sick of everything, too.</i>

525
00:43:22,424 --> 00:43:27,191
<i>But when she left me all alone...</i>

526
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:30,625
<i>I was so Ionely.</i>

527
00:43:34,335 --> 00:43:36,064
<i>People...</i>

528
00:43:37,272 --> 00:43:39,172
should never be alone.

529
00:44:08,436 --> 00:44:10,028
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

530
00:44:11,172 --> 00:44:13,231
<i>I want you to leave your fiancé.</i>

531
00:44:14,709 --> 00:44:19,238
<i>The girl that I love
is in love with him.</i>

532
00:44:21,082 --> 00:44:22,674
<i>I beg you.</i>

533
00:44:30,725 --> 00:44:32,590
Under one condition.

534
00:44:35,497 --> 00:44:37,098
But...

535
00:44:37,098 --> 00:44:38,656
But?

536
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:48,202
No, please! Tell me.

537
00:44:59,587 --> 00:45:01,817
I want to take your picture.

538
00:45:04,959 --> 00:45:10,454
Your medical records said
you don't have much time left.

539
00:45:11,699 --> 00:45:16,500
Now, that's an interesting model.

540
00:45:20,308 --> 00:45:22,572
I think it'll be fun.

541
00:45:22,777 --> 00:45:25,371
I don't think it'll be fun.

542
00:45:27,849 --> 00:45:29,783
Then the deal's off.

543
00:45:33,888 --> 00:45:35,913
Drink up, first!

544
00:45:36,224 --> 00:45:39,887
Give me a drink, too!

545
00:45:47,001 --> 00:45:49,868
-Hi! Hi!
-Hi! You're late!

546
00:45:54,442 --> 00:45:58,208
Hello. I spoke to you on the phone.

547
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,348
Oh, hi.

548
00:46:00,348 --> 00:46:01,610
I'm Kang Chul-kyu.

549
00:46:01,783 --> 00:46:03,045
Cha Joo-hwan.

550
00:46:03,151 --> 00:46:05,585
-Thanks again for that day.
-Anytime.

551
00:46:06,187 --> 00:46:07,552
You know him?

552
00:46:07,956 --> 00:46:09,321
The sterilizer?

553
00:46:12,393 --> 00:46:15,163
-Did you eat?
-No, I'll eat now.

554
00:46:15,163 --> 00:46:16,926
Why are you so late?

555
00:46:17,031 --> 00:46:19,465
-Still recording a show.
-What?

556
00:46:19,567 --> 00:46:21,035
You said you're done.

557
00:46:21,035 --> 00:46:23,560
Not yet. I gotta go back.

558
00:46:26,274 --> 00:46:27,935
-Here.
-Thank you.

559
00:46:31,379 --> 00:46:34,177
The song's great.

560
00:46:35,183 --> 00:46:36,650
'If I can live again'?

561
00:46:36,751 --> 00:46:38,810
Of course, I wrote it.

562
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:42,655
Sorry, I gotta run.

563
00:46:42,724 --> 00:46:46,717
-Come on.
-Don't go.

564
00:46:46,828 --> 00:46:48,227
I'll see you later.

565
00:46:48,696 --> 00:46:49,822
Bye.

566
00:46:50,465 --> 00:46:53,161
-See you next time, then.
-Sure.

567
00:46:58,473 --> 00:47:00,031
Be careful in the snow!

568
00:47:44,809 --> 00:47:46,911
Why are you back so early?

569
00:47:47,053 --> 00:47:50,216
Aren't you supposed
to be recording a show?

570
00:47:51,291 --> 00:47:53,259
Change of plans.

571
00:47:53,493 --> 00:47:56,360
Me, too.

572
00:48:01,402 --> 00:48:03,029
Drink this.

573
00:48:09,777 --> 00:48:11,369
Didn't you eat?

574
00:48:11,679 --> 00:48:15,775
I did, but I'm still starving.

575
00:48:21,655 --> 00:48:24,988
Why are you eating
noodles instead of rice?

576
00:48:25,259 --> 00:48:29,218
Just wanted something simple.

577
00:48:30,464 --> 00:48:31,761
It's good, huh?

578
00:48:34,969 --> 00:48:38,166
If you could stop time,
what would you do first?

579
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:45,234
If everyone else is frozen
and only you can move?

580
00:48:46,413 --> 00:48:49,712
If time stopped, you wouldn't die.

581
00:48:52,753 --> 00:48:54,550
Don't you want to live?

582
00:48:58,926 --> 00:49:00,689
Not talking to me?

583
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:07,257
Too sorry to die and leave
the girl you love alone.

584
00:49:09,470 --> 00:49:12,268
Okay, I can understand that much.

585
00:49:13,841 --> 00:49:15,468
But still...

586
00:49:17,277 --> 00:49:20,838
How can you marry her
off to someone else?

587
00:49:22,049 --> 00:49:25,143
Isn't that going overboard?

588
00:49:28,722 --> 00:49:31,122
You're not dead, yet.

589
00:49:33,293 --> 00:49:36,319
-How can you watch that?
-Ah, Jenna?

590
00:49:37,498 --> 00:49:40,228
Let's just stick to our jobs.

591
00:49:40,634 --> 00:49:43,967
What's love?

592
00:49:51,345 --> 00:49:53,279
Like brushing your teeth.

593
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:55,445
Brushing your teeth?

594
00:49:56,784 --> 00:49:58,886
But you do that alone.

595
00:49:58,886 --> 00:50:01,184
Do you brush to show someone?

596
00:50:04,825 --> 00:50:07,385
Why didn't you come yesterday?

597
00:50:12,199 --> 00:50:13,188
Pardon?

598
00:50:23,177 --> 00:50:25,668
I said, did you wait for me?

599
00:50:25,979 --> 00:50:33,010
Well, just wondering
why you didn't come.

600
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:36,214
You fell in love with me, didn't you?

601
00:50:36,557 --> 00:50:37,683
What?

602
00:50:37,691 --> 00:50:42,594
Love makes you wonder
and wait for that person.

603
00:50:43,897 --> 00:50:48,102
It's not that. If a patient
doesn't come, I wait.

604
00:50:48,102 --> 00:50:50,696
Do you wonder about every patient?

605
00:50:51,371 --> 00:50:52,895
Well...

606
00:50:54,141 --> 00:50:58,043
You're blushing. It's love all right.

607
00:51:00,047 --> 00:51:01,514
Hey, Kang Chul-kyu!

608
00:51:01,615 --> 00:51:03,173
Yes, boss.

609
00:51:03,383 --> 00:51:06,318
How much did you get from Kim Gap-sik?

610
00:51:07,721 --> 00:51:10,390
Should've been more discreet!

611
00:51:10,390 --> 00:51:12,950
Cat Girl's on your show 10 times a week!

612
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:16,029
Think people will stay still?

613
00:51:16,463 --> 00:51:22,231
Someone wrote in to audit your show!

614
00:51:22,402 --> 00:51:25,997
What's got into you all of a sudden?

615
00:51:26,106 --> 00:51:30,099
You of all people!

616
00:51:34,448 --> 00:51:36,541
When are you going to break it off?

617
00:51:37,584 --> 00:51:39,108
In a rush?

618
00:51:40,154 --> 00:51:42,145
You saw my medical records.

619
00:51:44,792 --> 00:51:47,158
I want to keep playing.

620
00:51:48,695 --> 00:51:53,189
But I guess you don't have that luxury.

621
00:51:58,338 --> 00:52:00,363
Under one condition.

622
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:08,914
Now, what.

623
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:12,014
I'll tell you after I break it off.

624
00:52:12,519 --> 00:52:14,714
A promise is a promise.

625
00:52:29,837 --> 00:52:33,432
Since when was it no smoking in here.

626
00:52:36,610 --> 00:52:38,407
No idea.

627
00:52:47,454 --> 00:52:51,481
Our parents will be shocked.

628
00:53:02,035 --> 00:53:08,475
I should be really angry
at a time like this, right?

629
00:53:08,475 --> 00:53:12,809
Yell at you or something?

630
00:53:15,682 --> 00:53:23,885
Funny, somehow I feel a little grateful.

631
00:53:26,126 --> 00:53:28,219
I'm going out for a smoke.

632
00:53:31,598 --> 00:53:32,963
So uncomfortable.

633
00:53:37,004 --> 00:53:38,767
My engagement's off.

634
00:53:47,381 --> 00:53:49,781
I don't have parents.

635
00:53:52,719 --> 00:53:56,246
I was studying late at high
school in my senior year.

636
00:53:57,457 --> 00:54:00,858
My homeroom teacher came
in and stared right at me.

637
00:54:01,128 --> 00:54:09,832
Like someone who came
to take me on death row.

638
00:54:11,305 --> 00:54:13,899
Like in the movies, you know?

639
00:54:15,275 --> 00:54:19,041
Anyway, he told me

640
00:54:19,313 --> 00:54:23,647
to go to the hospital right away.

641
00:54:23,984 --> 00:54:26,953
When I asked why...

642
00:54:27,187 --> 00:54:30,257
if he said my parents and

643
00:54:30,257 --> 00:54:33,693
sister died in a car accident...

644
00:54:34,227 --> 00:54:39,494
then I wouldn't have gone
and seen them like that.

645
00:54:41,401 --> 00:54:44,734
I see...

646
00:54:45,238 --> 00:54:47,968
Kay's been with me ever since.

647
00:54:48,942 --> 00:54:50,409
Kay?

648
00:54:52,646 --> 00:54:56,742
You saw him, Producer Kang Chul-kyu?

649
00:54:57,584 --> 00:55:01,418
His name sounds too corny
so I just call him Kay.

650
00:55:05,192 --> 00:55:09,424
At home, he's my Mom
At work, he's my Dad.

651
00:55:09,663 --> 00:55:11,858
When I'm sad, he's my brother.

652
00:55:12,632 --> 00:55:16,591
Sometimes he's like a lover.
Though he always chickens out.

653
00:55:18,205 --> 00:55:21,368
Can I kiss you?

654
00:55:23,076 --> 00:55:25,567
You wanna kiss me?

655
00:55:34,187 --> 00:55:35,552
Stupid.

656
00:55:36,857 --> 00:55:39,257
Let me see.

657
00:55:41,728 --> 00:55:42,786
Oh, no.

658
00:55:42,896 --> 00:55:44,921
That's right, I'm stupid!

659
00:55:53,807 --> 00:55:56,833
Open the door. Are you okay?

660
00:56:07,788 --> 00:56:10,018
<i>Don't look! Stupid!</i>

661
00:56:22,202 --> 00:56:24,295
<i>Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!</i>

662
00:56:52,265 --> 00:56:54,768
<i>I was born to love you.</i>

663
00:56:54,768 --> 00:56:58,829
<i>Heaven sent me to love you.</i>

664
00:57:00,774 --> 00:57:03,176
<i>Cat Girl's 'If
I could live again'</i>

665
00:57:03,176 --> 00:57:05,337
<i>requested by
ID: Little Mermaid.</i>

666
00:57:05,512 --> 00:57:07,514
-You wrote this song, Cream?
-Yes.

667
00:57:07,514 --> 00:57:10,074
Let's hear, 'If I could live again'.

668
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:20,951
(Did you eat?)

669
00:57:23,063 --> 00:57:25,054
(I'm almost done!)

670
00:57:41,581 --> 00:57:43,150
Yes, boss.

671
00:57:43,150 --> 00:57:46,920
<i>Come to my office, now.</i>

672
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:48,217
Okay.

673
00:57:56,229 --> 00:57:59,596
Producer Kang!

674
00:58:01,301 --> 00:58:02,427
Kang!

675
00:58:02,736 --> 00:58:08,275
I heard everything. I'm going to
speak with the boss, right now!

676
00:58:08,275 --> 00:58:13,269
How can he fire a genius like you!

677
00:58:13,446 --> 00:58:15,348
I'm not getting fired.

678
00:58:15,348 --> 00:58:18,151
Same difference.

679
00:58:18,151 --> 00:58:20,847
-You can't go like this!
-I'm taking a break.

680
00:58:20,921 --> 00:58:26,560
Really? That's not what I heard.

681
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:30,189
I'm going to the States
to study for a while.

682
00:58:30,297 --> 00:58:37,465
Really? Guess there's
no use going to the boss.

683
00:58:38,238 --> 00:58:42,142
Thank you for everything, Mr. Kim.

684
00:58:42,142 --> 00:58:45,578
-Anytime.
-You too, Min-chul.

685
00:58:45,812 --> 00:58:49,077
Give him the demo tape, Min-chul.

686
00:58:50,317 --> 00:58:54,219
Producer Choi! Hold on! Wait!

687
00:59:02,229 --> 00:59:03,856
Min-chul...

688
00:59:29,923 --> 00:59:31,185
It's a ballad.

689
00:59:31,691 --> 00:59:33,124
Write up a good song.

690
00:59:41,835 --> 00:59:43,530
What's marriage?

691
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:47,329
Marriage?

692
00:59:47,774 --> 00:59:49,139
Marriage.

693
00:59:53,546 --> 00:59:56,140
-Marriage...
-Wait!

694
01:00:08,595 --> 01:00:10,654
A toothbrush holder.

695
01:00:11,731 --> 01:00:13,494
What?

696
01:00:14,267 --> 01:00:18,704
There's only one holder,
but many toothbrushes.

697
01:00:20,674 --> 01:00:23,074
What's that got to do with marriage?

698
01:00:23,343 --> 01:00:30,306
Being together as one like
toothbrushes in a holder.

699
01:00:33,887 --> 01:00:36,355
Then I must be married, already.

700
01:00:37,691 --> 01:00:41,183
Stupid! You can't be
married without a wedding.

701
01:00:43,897 --> 01:00:45,364
Really?

702
01:00:47,667 --> 01:00:49,157
I gotta pee.

703
01:01:18,365 --> 01:01:20,265
<i>No one else but Thee.</i>

704
01:01:26,773 --> 01:01:28,900
'Thee' is a lucky person.

705
01:01:32,645 --> 01:01:34,545
Wanna hear it?

706
01:02:08,681 --> 01:02:14,244
Eun Won and I living
together probably got to you.

707
01:02:15,155 --> 01:02:16,856
But there's nothing to worry about.

708
01:02:16,856 --> 01:02:18,517
I'm okay with that.

709
01:02:19,192 --> 01:02:24,960
I'm thankful for
everything you did for her.

710
01:02:25,231 --> 01:02:28,826
Let's get together often.

711
01:02:29,135 --> 01:02:31,467
Go on trips together and stuff.

712
01:02:32,138 --> 01:02:33,605
Sounds good.

713
01:02:35,442 --> 01:02:40,243
She says she wants to pick
out her wedding dress with you.

714
01:02:40,513 --> 01:02:42,242
Gotta love her wild ideas.

715
01:02:42,348 --> 01:02:44,373
Why me?

716
01:02:44,651 --> 01:02:48,382
I want what she wants.

717
01:02:51,291 --> 01:02:53,851
Please do it for her.

718
01:02:55,995 --> 01:03:04,733
And I hope it's the last
thing you ever do for her.

719
01:03:06,906 --> 01:03:10,569
Sure. Please take good care of her.

720
01:03:10,710 --> 01:03:14,806
Of course. She's my woman, now.

721
01:03:15,114 --> 01:03:16,479
Let's drink.

722
01:03:32,165 --> 01:03:33,723
What do you think?

723
01:03:39,873 --> 01:03:41,363
Very pretty.

724
01:03:44,911 --> 01:03:49,143
It's time for the groom-to-be
to try on his suit.

725
01:03:51,017 --> 01:03:52,452
I'm not the groom.

726
01:03:52,452 --> 01:03:54,044
Try it on.

727
01:04:02,729 --> 01:04:03,991
Come up here.

728
01:04:07,267 --> 01:04:11,260
Come here. Can you take a picture of us?

729
01:04:11,404 --> 01:04:14,931
On three. One, two, three!

730
01:04:23,683 --> 01:04:26,516
Wait out there. I'll
try on something else.

731
01:07:02,275 --> 01:07:04,800
Why are all the clocks stopped?

732
01:07:05,211 --> 01:07:06,508
No reason.

733
01:07:10,016 --> 01:07:12,382
Can I turn one on?

734
01:07:16,489 --> 01:07:17,922
Why?

735
01:07:18,691 --> 01:07:19,988
No reason.

736
01:07:21,928 --> 01:07:23,486
No reason?

737
01:07:24,797 --> 01:07:26,059
Sure.

738
01:07:52,058 --> 01:07:56,722
Jenna? I have a big favor to ask.

739
01:07:57,797 --> 01:07:59,264
What is it?

740
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:07,070
I need to send flowers on her
anniversary for a few years.

741
01:08:10,209 --> 01:08:14,145
She'll get suspicious, if
I lose touch altogether.

742
01:08:17,784 --> 01:08:20,548
I had one more condition. Remember?

743
01:08:23,556 --> 01:08:25,353
What is it?

744
01:08:48,247 --> 01:08:50,374
Please die at my side.

745
01:08:57,824 --> 01:09:01,089
You booked the tickets?

746
01:09:04,263 --> 01:09:06,925
I'm running low on battery.

747
01:09:08,568 --> 01:09:09,762
Hey.

748
01:09:12,205 --> 01:09:13,502
What are you making?

749
01:09:18,277 --> 01:09:21,269
My phone battery ran out.

750
01:09:21,948 --> 01:09:28,217
I'll charge it and call you back later.

751
01:09:28,387 --> 01:09:29,789
Bye.

752
01:09:29,789 --> 01:09:31,086
Hi.

753
01:09:35,595 --> 01:09:39,224
Why'd you leave me there like that?

754
01:09:40,366 --> 01:09:41,833
It's for you.

755
01:09:52,478 --> 01:09:54,241
Who do you think you are!

756
01:09:54,847 --> 01:09:56,576
What's with you?

757
01:09:56,749 --> 01:09:59,582
Who says you can touch my phone!

758
01:10:01,854 --> 01:10:03,685
The hell you...

759
01:10:06,959 --> 01:10:09,553
Who says you can do
whatever you want with me!

760
01:10:43,296 --> 01:10:44,593
Can I help you?

761
01:10:44,697 --> 01:10:46,324
Is Kay home?

762
01:10:47,900 --> 01:10:49,527
Kay?

763
01:11:13,159 --> 01:11:14,922
Someone's here.

764
01:11:33,746 --> 01:11:38,240
She's pretty. I can
see why you love her.

765
01:11:39,652 --> 01:11:44,646
You think she's happy?

766
01:11:45,725 --> 01:11:47,625
What are you saying?

767
01:11:48,394 --> 01:11:50,453
She didn't seem happy.

768
01:11:52,531 --> 01:11:55,898
Can you send this for the next 3 years?

769
01:11:57,737 --> 01:11:59,170
It's pretty.

770
01:12:00,539 --> 01:12:02,404
Maybe too pretty.

771
01:12:05,678 --> 01:12:08,806
It looks fake. Like your love.

772
01:12:09,882 --> 01:12:11,816
Then what's real?

773
01:12:15,888 --> 01:12:17,321
Real?

774
01:12:19,792 --> 01:12:23,785
If you're hungry, you eat.
If you're hurting, you cry.

775
01:12:24,163 --> 01:12:29,157
If you're having fun, you
laugh. Not hold it in like you.

776
01:12:30,603 --> 01:12:33,231
You really wanna die like this?

777
01:12:35,975 --> 01:12:37,465
No!

778
01:12:39,678 --> 01:12:41,543
I don't want to die like this.

779
01:12:42,948 --> 01:12:45,143
I want to live a happy life.

780
01:12:47,787 --> 01:12:50,051
I want to be the one marrying Eun Won...

781
01:12:51,190 --> 01:12:53,215
...instead of him, tomorrow.

782
01:12:57,563 --> 01:12:59,030
But...

783
01:13:00,299 --> 01:13:01,960
That's just a dream.

784
01:13:02,635 --> 01:13:04,330
A sad dream.

785
01:13:07,740 --> 01:13:10,903
I'm done with dreaming.

786
01:14:06,232 --> 01:14:08,792
<i>Sleep tight and sweet dreams.</i>

787
01:14:29,121 --> 01:14:32,181
<i>Did you eat?
-Cream</i>

788
01:14:36,262 --> 01:14:37,593
Thanks.

789
01:14:56,815 --> 01:14:58,874
<i>I'm not talking to you.</i>

790
01:15:07,326 --> 01:15:08,850
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

791
01:15:15,901 --> 01:15:17,334
<i>For what?</i>

792
01:15:20,206 --> 01:15:21,764
<i>For everything.</i>

793
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:30,311
<i>I'm sorry, too.</i>

794
01:15:31,050 --> 01:15:32,347
<i>For what?</i>

795
01:15:33,452 --> 01:15:34,749
<i>For everything.</i>

796
01:15:38,057 --> 01:15:41,117
<i>I love you...</i>

797
01:15:45,231 --> 01:15:46,664
<i>I like you.</i>

798
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,331
<i>Me, too.</i>

799
01:18:10,876 --> 01:18:12,741
That's some story.

800
01:18:15,013 --> 01:18:18,346
Kang... amazing guy. I had no idea.

801
01:18:19,985 --> 01:18:26,413
Is there anyway to reach
them? What about the dentist?

802
01:18:32,798 --> 01:18:36,097
Wonder what happened to her.

803
01:18:43,375 --> 01:18:46,674
Let's record it.

804
01:18:48,514 --> 01:18:51,210
Really? I'll call right now.

805
01:18:51,383 --> 01:18:54,580
No, the other song.

806
01:18:55,921 --> 01:18:58,446
Oh, that song.

807
01:20:23,909 --> 01:20:25,677
I gotta go, I'm late.

808
01:20:25,677 --> 01:20:29,044
Get up and eat. I made breakfast.

809
01:21:26,638 --> 01:21:28,003
<i>What's this?</i>

810
01:21:29,241 --> 01:21:33,610
<i>Ah, Vitamin ABC. It
helps me get smarter.</i>

811
01:22:20,692 --> 01:22:23,820
Where'd you get these pills?

812
01:22:24,296 --> 01:22:26,491
They're my friends' pills.

813
01:22:27,199 --> 01:22:31,659
Since when did your
friend start taking this?

814
01:22:32,571 --> 01:22:34,095
Why?

815
01:22:34,773 --> 01:22:39,073
The pain must've been
severe to take these pills.

816
01:22:40,545 --> 01:22:41,637
What?

817
01:22:42,180 --> 01:22:47,709
They're painkillers for
patients with cancer or leukemia.

818
01:22:48,020 --> 01:22:50,079
<i>Terminal patients.</i>

819
01:22:51,390 --> 01:22:55,121
<i>Have you heard of
the hospice ward?</i>

820
01:22:56,061 --> 01:22:59,861
<i>It's where dying patients stay...</i>

821
01:23:00,298 --> 01:23:04,359
<i>with consent from their families.</i>

822
01:23:19,351 --> 01:23:20,613
Mom!

823
01:23:20,752 --> 01:23:23,355
Watch the house while we're out.

824
01:23:23,355 --> 01:23:25,755
See you later, sis!

825
01:23:31,930 --> 01:23:33,363
No!

826
01:23:58,090 --> 01:24:01,150
<i>When I found out what
Vitamin ABC really was...</i>

827
01:24:01,393 --> 01:24:05,261
<i>When I finally realized
what they were...</i>

828
01:24:05,497 --> 01:24:10,059
<i>When my whole world
turned pitch dark before me...</i>

829
01:24:10,502 --> 01:24:11,969
What's wrong?

830
01:24:12,204 --> 01:24:14,900
<i>I died before Kay.</i>

831
01:24:17,809 --> 01:24:25,545
<i>I met Kay a year after my
whole family passed away.</i>

832
01:24:27,285 --> 01:24:31,278
<i>Though almost 3 hours passed...</i>

833
01:24:32,624 --> 01:24:35,718
<i>he stood there frozen like stone.</i>

834
01:24:35,961 --> 01:24:39,564
<i>Crying and looking in the
direction his mother went.</i>

835
01:24:39,564 --> 01:24:44,365
<i>This will be enough to support you
till you're an adult, Chul-kyu.</i>

836
01:24:45,437 --> 01:24:51,535
<i>He looked sadder
and more hurt than me.</i>

837
01:24:52,978 --> 01:24:55,776
<i>He needed a hug
more than me.</i>

838
01:24:56,782 --> 01:24:59,046
Is there anything you want to tell me?

839
01:24:59,818 --> 01:25:01,342
Like what?

840
01:25:04,523 --> 01:25:08,220
A deep, dark secret?

841
01:25:10,896 --> 01:25:14,457
Say anything. I'm ready to listen.

842
01:25:16,067 --> 01:25:17,500
I like you.

843
01:25:17,803 --> 01:25:20,431
<i>Stupid idiot.</i>

844
01:25:21,039 --> 01:25:22,836
Do you have a wish?

845
01:25:22,941 --> 01:25:24,509
What's with you?

846
01:25:24,509 --> 01:25:27,637
Just curious all of a sudden.

847
01:25:29,381 --> 01:25:33,147
If you could do anything
you want in the world.

848
01:25:33,752 --> 01:25:35,743
<i>Kay is dying.</i>

849
01:25:36,087 --> 01:25:38,555
Meet a great guy and get married.

850
01:25:38,723 --> 01:25:40,592
Can't I marry you?

851
01:25:40,592 --> 01:25:42,787
I'm not a great guy.

852
01:25:42,961 --> 01:25:45,263
Then who is?

853
01:25:45,263 --> 01:25:49,165
Someone who is healthy and nice.

854
01:25:49,734 --> 01:25:52,225
Who knows how to take
care of his family.

855
01:25:53,438 --> 01:25:56,635
<i>I already met a great guy.</i>

856
01:25:57,475 --> 01:26:01,138
<i>But Kay told me to
meet someone else.</i>

857
01:26:01,613 --> 01:26:05,105
<i>He said that was his wish.</i>

858
01:26:06,685 --> 01:26:10,621
<i>Kang Chul-kyu</i>

859
01:26:14,292 --> 01:26:17,386
<i>When I heard Kay fainted...</i>

860
01:26:17,896 --> 01:26:21,662
<i>I rushed over,
afraid I'll go crazy.</i>

861
01:26:23,335 --> 01:26:25,132
<i>But I...</i>

862
01:26:26,071 --> 01:26:27,672
<i>... couldn't even go crazy.</i>

863
01:26:27,672 --> 01:26:29,674
No, doc.

864
01:26:29,674 --> 01:26:32,336
But she should know.

865
01:26:33,311 --> 01:26:35,802
What are you going to do?

866
01:26:36,514 --> 01:26:38,573
I don't know.

867
01:26:42,988 --> 01:26:45,889
It feels like a needle
stuck in my throat.

868
01:26:49,227 --> 01:26:50,956
Right here.

869
01:26:52,731 --> 01:26:54,858
It gets stuck right here.

870
01:26:56,334 --> 01:26:58,962
I can't say it.

871
01:27:00,672 --> 01:27:07,475
She'll live on. Think of yourself.

872
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:10,680
She's different.

873
01:27:12,017 --> 01:27:14,110
She needs someone beside her.

874
01:27:29,434 --> 01:27:31,925
-Hello.
-There goes Mr. Perfect.

875
01:27:33,238 --> 01:27:35,638
Glowing from head to toe!

876
01:27:40,478 --> 01:27:42,742
<i>I picked a man.</i>

877
01:27:52,524 --> 01:27:54,685
Which side did you drink from?

878
01:27:57,796 --> 01:27:59,030
Pardon?

879
01:27:59,030 --> 01:28:01,430
I'm engaged.

880
01:28:01,967 --> 01:28:09,339
<i>Stupid. You think I care
whether you're engaged or not?</i>

881
01:28:10,642 --> 01:28:14,237
<i>Just play along and
meet me. For Kay.</i>

882
01:28:15,313 --> 01:28:17,338
<i>Am I a bitch?</i>

883
01:28:18,049 --> 01:28:20,552
<i>I don't have time
to worry about that!</i>

884
01:28:20,552 --> 01:28:22,918
<i>The man I love is dying!</i>

885
01:28:33,798 --> 01:28:39,600
<i>If I could be born again...
A ring? A pair of glasses?</i>

886
01:28:41,306 --> 01:28:45,402
<i>A bed? A diary?</i>

887
01:28:45,877 --> 01:28:49,574
<i>Born again as things like
that? What fun is that?</i>

888
01:28:49,848 --> 01:28:54,478
<i>You can buy me. It'll
always be fun at your side.</i>

889
01:29:10,502 --> 01:29:14,302
What's wrong? Are you okay?

890
01:29:16,408 --> 01:29:17,670
Let me see your hand.

891
01:29:25,050 --> 01:29:26,540
Where are you going?

892
01:29:46,271 --> 01:29:48,239
<i>I made a deal with myself.</i>

893
01:29:48,973 --> 01:29:51,441
<i>If he turns around,
I'd tell him everything.</i>

894
01:29:52,977 --> 01:29:57,346
<i>If he turns around, I'd
hug him and stop everything.</i>

895
01:29:59,084 --> 01:30:02,076
<i>But Kay didn't look back.</i>

896
01:30:03,421 --> 01:30:06,879
<i>And there was nothing
I could do.</i>

897
01:30:12,564 --> 01:30:15,032
Why are you eating
noodles instead of rice?

898
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,195
Just wanted something simple.

899
01:30:21,706 --> 01:30:24,300
-It's good, huh?
-Yeah.

900
01:30:28,379 --> 01:30:31,473
<i>As I sat eating the
noodles with him...</i>

901
01:30:32,650 --> 01:30:35,053
<i>I'd think, 'Don't
die you bastard'</i>

902
01:30:35,053 --> 01:30:37,920
<i>and drank some water instead.</i>

903
01:30:38,423 --> 01:30:43,190
<i>'Tell me. Let me hold you!
I'll die with you! '</i>

904
01:30:43,528 --> 01:30:47,988
<i>'I'll follow you and pay you back
for everything you did for me! '</i>

905
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:51,997
<i>Instead, I just drank the water.</i>

906
01:30:53,037 --> 01:30:55,665
<i>And finished the noodles.</i>

907
01:30:59,844 --> 01:31:05,476
There's only one holder,
but many toothbrushes.

908
01:31:07,085 --> 01:31:09,883
What's that got to do with marriage?

909
01:31:10,755 --> 01:31:17,319
Being together as one like
toothbrushes in a holder.

910
01:31:21,099 --> 01:31:23,397
Then I must be married, already.

911
01:31:24,869 --> 01:31:28,737
Stupid! You can't be
married without a wedding.

912
01:31:30,742 --> 01:31:32,232
Really?

913
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:04,840
Can we get married, soon?

914
01:32:30,268 --> 01:32:32,998
Wait out there. I'll
try on something else.

915
01:33:09,474 --> 01:33:11,567
The hell you...

916
01:33:14,579 --> 01:33:17,377
Who says you can do
whatever you want with me!

917
01:33:27,725 --> 01:33:29,317
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

918
01:33:35,967 --> 01:33:38,993
<i>I want to tell him I love him.</i>

919
01:33:39,404 --> 01:33:43,773
<i>I want to open my mouth
and say I love him.</i>

920
01:33:45,243 --> 01:33:49,111
<i>But I knew tears will fall
before I could say it.</i>

921
01:33:49,447 --> 01:33:52,848
<i>So I kept silent, again.</i>

922
01:34:06,230 --> 01:34:08,425
When are you going to talk to me?

923
01:34:09,934 --> 01:34:14,428
Didn't you hear me screaming
at you all this time?

924
01:34:15,039 --> 01:34:16,472
What?

925
01:34:17,975 --> 01:34:19,636
Stupid.

926
01:34:20,378 --> 01:34:22,312
I didn't hear anything.

927
01:34:23,348 --> 01:34:25,646
Then how can mutes love?

928
01:34:37,895 --> 01:34:39,692
I love you.

929
01:34:44,635 --> 01:34:46,102
Me, too.

930
01:35:10,828 --> 01:35:13,422
<i>We became a real couple.</i>

931
01:35:13,664 --> 01:35:15,791
<i>Cuz we made it down the aisle.</i>

932
01:36:48,059 --> 01:36:50,254
<i>Heaven's Gate Resting Place</i>

933
01:37:09,213 --> 01:37:10,339
Wait!

934
01:37:10,414 --> 01:37:11,779
You never learn!

935
01:37:12,884 --> 01:37:14,749
How can you write
with a brain like that?

936
01:37:23,995 --> 01:37:26,395
This isn't kissing, is it?

937
01:37:38,576 --> 01:37:40,134
Can you take a picture of us?

938
01:37:40,378 --> 01:37:42,812
On three. One, two, three!

939
01:37:44,715 --> 01:37:52,781
<i>I was born to love you.
Heaven send me to love you.</i>

940
01:38:52,183 --> 01:38:55,152
<i>-Eun Won-</i>

941
01:38:55,319 --> 01:38:56,887
<i>I'm making noodles.
Want some?</i>

942
01:38:56,887 --> 01:38:58,956
<i>No, I gotta work.</i>

943
01:38:58,956 --> 01:39:00,324
<i>You sure?</i>

944
01:39:00,324 --> 01:39:02,087
<i>Yes, I'm working!</i>

945
01:39:02,193 --> 01:39:06,186
<i>-Then I'm just making one!
-Okay.</i>

946
01:39:07,064 --> 01:39:08,895
<i>Don't come beggin' later.</i>

947
01:39:09,033 --> 01:39:11,035
<i>-Hey!
-What?</i>

948
01:39:11,035 --> 01:39:14,198
<i>No eggs! Give me that.</i>

949
01:39:16,641 --> 01:39:19,166
<i>Wonder who invented noodles.</i>

950
01:39:19,377 --> 01:39:21,879
<i>You said you didn't want any.</i>

951
01:39:21,879 --> 01:39:23,471
<i>Changed my mind.</i>

952
01:39:24,382 --> 01:39:25,906
<i>Is there any rice?</i>

953
01:39:27,718 --> 01:39:30,949
<i>Hold on. There's
some in the fridge.</i>

954
01:39:32,156 --> 01:39:37,219
<i>Chul-kyu...
I'm coming to you.</i>

955
01:39:38,562 --> 01:39:41,030
<i>Don't worry.</i>

956
01:39:42,133 --> 01:39:46,467
<i>I trust you. You
were always my compass.</i>

957
01:39:48,205 --> 01:39:53,310
<i>Remember when I said
I can see you</i>

958
01:39:53,310 --> 01:39:56,507
<i>even when you're not with me?</i>

959
01:39:58,282 --> 01:40:00,614
<i>Go wherever you want.</i>

960
01:40:01,585 --> 01:40:04,418
<i>I'll find you, soon.</i>

961
01:40:06,323 --> 01:40:10,191
<i>Don't get mad when you see me.</i>

962
01:40:11,662 --> 01:40:19,262
<i>Don't ask me why I followed
you or get angry at me.</i>

963
01:40:20,638 --> 01:40:27,669
<i>After everything to come to
you, if you get mad I'll cry.</i>

964
01:40:29,013 --> 01:40:34,041
<i>When we meet again on the other
side, let's not cry again.</i>

965
01:40:34,218 --> 01:40:37,210
<i>Wait for me.
I'll be right there.</i>

966
01:44:25,022 --> 01:44:30,322
