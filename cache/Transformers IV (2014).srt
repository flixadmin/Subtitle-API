1
00:02:33,983 --> 00:02:35,212
Oh, shit.

2
00:02:35,236 --> 00:02:37,091
Darcy, you really should not have come.

3
00:02:37,937 --> 00:02:38,841
Show me.

4
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:48,533
Corporate was adamant.
We keep running.

5
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,338
No stopping operations.

6
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,243
No, no, no. You got to go through.

7
00:02:52,267 --> 00:02:53,508
No cameras.

8
00:02:53,925 --> 00:02:54,926
He is got orders to kill.

9
00:02:54,951 --> 00:02:56,694
I don't even think international
laws apply up here.

10
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:58,548
We are geologists first.

11
00:02:59,081 --> 00:03:01,375
If this thing has any
historical significance at all,

12
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,879
we are shutting down.

13
00:03:02,903 --> 00:03:04,060
I am shutting us down.

14
00:03:06,271 --> 00:03:07,531
Oh, he is going to shoot me?

15
00:03:07,555 --> 00:03:09,424
Shoot me.
Hey, don't kill her.

16
00:03:10,567 --> 00:03:12,367
This is crazy stuff.

17
00:03:21,494 --> 00:03:22,996
Crazy shit.

18
00:03:29,252 --> 00:03:30,920
Well, what do you think?

19
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,906
I think history is about to change.

20
00:04:09,334 --> 00:04:11,198
<i>♪ I am a nasty woman ♪</i>

21
00:04:11,336 --> 00:04:13,182
Oh, look who decided to show up for work.

22
00:04:16,827 --> 00:04:18,783
<i>♪ I am a heartbreaker ♪</i>

23
00:04:19,234 --> 00:04:21,422
<i>♪ Gonna make you cry ♪</i>

24
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:26,765
What, surf report no good at South Padre?

25
00:04:26,994 --> 00:04:29,257
The waves are flat and I got no gas.

26
00:04:29,281 --> 00:04:30,673
You know that, Cade.

27
00:04:33,358 --> 00:04:34,859
Dude. Rude.

28
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:37,140
Look at these two junebugs.

29
00:04:37,821 --> 00:04:38,649
My, my!

30
00:04:38,674 --> 00:04:40,688
Hey, you are paying me on
this one, right Cade?

31
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:42,085
Please tell me I am getting paid.

32
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,391
You know Lucas, a lot of guys are
just happy to have a job at all.

33
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:45,542
Yeah, I suppose.

34
00:04:45,745 --> 00:04:47,172
You got any cash on you?
Yeah.

35
00:04:47,765 --> 00:04:48,557
Alright, good.

36
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,117
Hey, Lucas Flannery.

37
00:04:59,563 --> 00:05:01,545
Place has been in the family since '28.

38
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:04,530
Granddaddy ran it all his life.
Ain't that right, Granddaddy?

39
00:05:05,348 --> 00:05:07,684
Real soon he is going to sign it over to me.

40
00:05:07,892 --> 00:05:10,395
The movies nowadays, that's the trouble.

41
00:05:10,812 --> 00:05:13,147
Sequels and remakes, bunch of crap.

42
00:05:13,356 --> 00:05:15,139
I love that one.

43
00:05:15,764 --> 00:05:17,366
He is deaf and senile.

44
00:05:17,391 --> 00:05:18,405
Heard that.

45
00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:20,981
Now these just need some spit and polish.

46
00:05:21,006 --> 00:05:22,477
I believe they are digital,

47
00:05:22,501 --> 00:05:23,842
possibly IMAX.

48
00:05:23,992 --> 00:05:24,993
Yeah they are not.

49
00:05:25,076 --> 00:05:27,023
Mister, we will have a look around if
you want to leave us to it, ok?

50
00:05:27,048 --> 00:05:29,581
You know, folks used
to come from miles around

51
00:05:29,606 --> 00:05:32,289
to see the dancing girls with
the big cha-chas.

52
00:05:32,834 --> 00:05:33,835
I swear to God

53
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,055
I am one diaper change away
from poisoning his oatmeal.

54
00:05:36,212 --> 00:05:37,621
Hey, you hang in there buddy.

55
00:05:37,646 --> 00:05:38,773
If coming here makes you feel young,

56
00:05:38,798 --> 00:05:40,443
then you tell this kid
to bring you here every day.

57
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:42,177
Seven bucks, I keep talking.

58
00:05:42,835 --> 00:05:43,878
Sold.

59
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:47,383
Remember this place
when we were kids?

60
00:05:47,932 --> 00:05:50,376
How many girls you think you
brought here in high school?

61
00:05:54,272 --> 00:05:55,523
I only remember one.

62
00:05:57,483 --> 00:05:58,651
Hey, heads!

63
00:06:05,258 --> 00:06:06,873
That's why you didn't make
the varsity team.

64
00:06:09,078 --> 00:06:09,983
Alright.

65
00:06:10,577 --> 00:06:11,722
Go long.

66
00:06:17,105 --> 00:06:17,972
Leave it.

67
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:42,866
Mortar shells?

68
00:06:43,328 --> 00:06:44,741
What the hell happened to you?

69
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:46,936
Hey, Snakeballs.

70
00:06:47,404 --> 00:06:48,757
How much for the truck?

71
00:06:50,161 --> 00:06:51,215
Truck?

72
00:07:05,779 --> 00:07:07,206
Two more weeks, girls,

73
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:09,013
till no more classes ever.

74
00:07:09,112 --> 00:07:11,878
Almost time to get
a tan and get wasted!

75
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,568
Please, please.

76
00:07:46,676 --> 00:07:48,122
No financial aid.

77
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:49,428
Great.

78
00:07:54,684 --> 00:07:55,505
Yes,

79
00:07:55,756 --> 00:07:57,436
I know I am home, thank you.

80
00:07:57,461 --> 00:07:58,633
<i>Intruder alert!</i>

81
00:07:58,657 --> 00:08:00,348
<i>Back away from the premises!</i>

82
00:08:00,373 --> 00:08:01,928
Voice recognition. It's me!

83
00:08:01,952 --> 00:08:03,330
<i>I am dialing 911.</i>

84
00:08:03,355 --> 00:08:05,507
Go right ahead. I don't care.

85
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:08,116
<i>I am still calling 911.</i>

86
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:11,659
<i>The Battle of Chicago was an event
that permanently changed our world.</i>

87
00:08:11,684 --> 00:08:12,644
<i>Over 1,300 dead.</i>

88
00:08:12,669 --> 00:08:14,336
<i>Much of the city has been destroyed.</i>

89
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:16,378
<i>Homeland Security is urging everyone</i>

90
00:08:16,403 --> 00:08:18,432
<i>to report suspicious alien activity.</i>

91
00:08:20,783 --> 00:08:22,211
<i>A Swift act of Congress</i>

92
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:24,338
<i>put an end to all joint operations</i>

93
00:08:24,363 --> 00:08:26,244
<i>between the military and the Autobots,</i>

94
00:08:26,386 --> 00:08:27,801
<i>ending the alliance.</i>

95
00:08:28,426 --> 00:08:29,580
<i>As this committee knows,</i>

96
00:08:29,663 --> 00:08:31,791
<i>the Invasion of Chicago
was a defining day</i>

97
00:08:31,815 --> 00:08:33,462
<i>for our nation five years ago.</i>

98
00:08:33,751 --> 00:08:35,938
The day millions of people realized that...

99
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:38,214
never again can we allow aliens,

100
00:08:38,238 --> 00:08:39,634
to fight our battles for us.

101
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:41,217
A handful...

102
00:08:41,449 --> 00:08:43,691
of Autobots were given sanctuary

103
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:46,129
after joint-combat
operations were abolished.

104
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:47,598
Fewer than a dozen...

105
00:08:47,622 --> 00:08:49,371
Decepticons are still on the run.

106
00:08:50,093 --> 00:08:51,837
Thanks to our CIA unit.

107
00:08:52,442 --> 00:08:53,735
Cemetery Wind.

108
00:08:53,805 --> 00:08:55,188
<i>Hurry, let's get it to my house, guys.</i>

109
00:08:55,213 --> 00:08:56,563
As for the alien technology,

110
00:08:56,588 --> 00:08:58,724
our objective remains
to keep it in American control.

111
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:00,542
<i>Hi. My name is Timothy.
This is my crew.</i>

112
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:03,002
<i>We found this alien ball turret in Chicago.</i>

113
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,687
<i>We just found it in the rubble
and it's all working...</i>

114
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:06,959
Word has it Japan,

115
00:09:06,983 --> 00:09:09,908
India, the Israelis may have gotten
their hands on a couple of ships.

116
00:09:10,814 --> 00:09:12,821
Apparently the Russians are
starting a bidding war.

117
00:09:12,853 --> 00:09:16,524
<i>We are taking $5,000 for it.
It's got 36 guns, alien shit.</i>

118
00:09:17,475 --> 00:09:18,935
A new era has begun.

119
00:09:19,185 --> 00:09:20,423
And the age of the Transformers...

120
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,547
is over.

121
00:09:44,043 --> 00:09:44,904
Hey.

122
00:09:45,503 --> 00:09:46,199
<i>Hey,</i>

123
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,317
<i>I have been waiting for you.</i>

124
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:50,716
<i>You are looking hot today!</i>

125
00:09:50,741 --> 00:09:51,496
Oh, yeah?

126
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:53,597
How about you take your shirt off?

127
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:55,388
<i>You want me to take
my shirt off right now?</i>

128
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:56,714
<i>What would your dad think of that?</i>

129
00:09:56,739 --> 00:09:58,034
What the hell?
<i>Hey, where you going?</i>

130
00:09:58,059 --> 00:10:00,061
I cannot believe him.
I cannot believe this.

131
00:10:02,687 --> 00:10:04,063
What the hell?

132
00:10:04,323 --> 00:10:05,473
All the way!

133
00:10:09,957 --> 00:10:11,083
A truck?

134
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:12,225
Dad,

135
00:10:12,857 --> 00:10:14,548
please tell me you didn't spend
our money on this.

136
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:16,369
Oh, no, don't worry, he didn't.
He spent my money.

137
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:17,715
A hundred and fifty bucks of it.

138
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,367
As an advance on your regular paycheck.

139
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:21,622
What regular paycheck?
Which you will get back.

140
00:10:21,706 --> 00:10:23,312
When?
Never. We are broke.

141
00:10:23,474 --> 00:10:24,390
I knew it.

142
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,529
Sweetheart, could you please
not drive a wedge

143
00:10:26,554 --> 00:10:28,062
between employer and employee.

144
00:10:28,093 --> 00:10:29,632
Hold on. I thought we were partners.

145
00:10:29,657 --> 00:10:31,785
Look, I came up short, ok?
I had to buy her a prom dress.

146
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,144
You want me to deny her a prom dress?

147
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:34,839
You might as well.
You denied her a prom date.

148
00:10:34,864 --> 00:10:36,946
No, I offered to take her and chaperone.

149
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:38,835
Nobody wants to go to the dance
with their dad.

150
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,714
It's weird.

151
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:40,891
It's not the issue.

152
00:10:41,267 --> 00:10:42,518
Well, maybe it should be.

153
00:10:42,641 --> 00:10:44,262
Hey, could you guys just get off my case?

154
00:10:44,287 --> 00:10:45,537
You know what the engine on this runs for?

155
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:46,977
I can break it down and strip it for parts.

156
00:10:47,002 --> 00:10:49,576
And sweetheart, your shorts are
shrinking by the second, ok?

157
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,896
Cold water, air dry, please.

158
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:55,463
I think she looks hot.

159
00:10:55,979 --> 00:10:56,980
What did you say?

160
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:58,674
Like a hot teenager.

161
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:01,245
Oh, it's the teenager thing
that makes it better. Thank you.

162
00:11:01,329 --> 00:11:03,041
It didn't sound like what it meant.

163
00:11:07,418 --> 00:11:08,734
That goes by the circuit boards.

164
00:11:10,171 --> 00:11:11,819
Put the Zeiss lenses over there.

165
00:11:13,341 --> 00:11:15,949
Dad, please.
You can't keep spending money on junk

166
00:11:15,974 --> 00:11:17,723
just so you can turn it into different junk.

167
00:11:17,748 --> 00:11:19,500
We do not use the J word in here.

168
00:11:19,764 --> 00:11:22,365
That is a Super Simplex theater projector.
It's very rare.

169
00:11:22,421 --> 00:11:23,857
What about the SmilePilot?

170
00:11:24,602 --> 00:11:27,104
Or the Exer-Mower that I invented?
Simply ahead of their time.

171
00:11:27,355 --> 00:11:29,732
Yeah, like the alleged Guard-Dawg.

172
00:11:31,317 --> 00:11:32,590
You are gonna get him upset.

173
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:35,279
Hey, Cade! Cade!

174
00:11:36,055 --> 00:11:37,207
This thing still work?

175
00:11:37,232 --> 00:11:38,059
No!
Yes.

176
00:11:38,084 --> 00:11:39,410
Yes, and still groundbreaking.

177
00:11:39,435 --> 00:11:42,031
Go back there and lay on the recliner
and just wait for a cold one.

178
00:11:46,641 --> 00:11:48,102
Dude, stop breaking stuff.

179
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:51,396
Final notice, late notice, past due.

180
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,857
Come on, come on.

181
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:57,333
Bring Daddy the alcohol.
Come on.

182
00:11:57,385 --> 00:11:59,887
I mean, what is all this crap people send you?

183
00:12:00,402 --> 00:12:02,071
That's a Discman and that's an 8-track tape.

184
00:12:02,663 --> 00:12:04,748
Music.
Never heard of it.

185
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:08,963
Look, I fix that, it's 100 bucks.
I fix that, it's $250.

186
00:12:08,988 --> 00:12:11,356
If I would have been able to fix
that before you broke it even more,

187
00:12:11,381 --> 00:12:12,426
it would have been 20 bucks.

188
00:12:12,473 --> 00:12:14,112
This stuff is what's gonna
put you through college,

189
00:12:14,137 --> 00:12:15,777
as long as you land one
of those scholarships.

190
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:18,786
What's the estimated time
of arrival usually? Average?

191
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:23,966
Wait. So it just brings the beer near you?

192
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,184
That's the trick?

193
00:12:25,636 --> 00:12:27,473
It's got a couple kinks, man.
Yeah.

194
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:29,996
Dad, you think maybe some things
should never be invented?

195
00:12:30,021 --> 00:12:31,727
No, I don't. That's backwards thinking.

196
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:34,338
This is a temple of technology.
You guys are standing in a holy place.

197
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:38,259
What do you think?
Why don't you look at all of this?

198
00:12:38,342 --> 00:12:40,618
This could be yours.
What about this land?

199
00:12:40,643 --> 00:12:42,950
Purple People Eater is back
and she looks hungry.

200
00:12:43,514 --> 00:12:45,241
Isn't this incredible?

201
00:12:45,266 --> 00:12:46,684
I knew you would like it.
Hey, you!

202
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:47,728
Hey.

203
00:12:48,657 --> 00:12:50,900
I own this house!
It's not for sale!

204
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,165
Six months late on payments, Mr. Yeager.

205
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,192
And I see you stealing power at the pole.

206
00:12:55,276 --> 00:12:56,819
Hey, that's not your concern.

207
00:12:56,902 --> 00:12:58,880
Sir, do you wanna see the property?
Sure.

208
00:12:58,905 --> 00:13:00,513
I would be more than happy
to give you a tour.

209
00:13:00,538 --> 00:13:01,991
I will show you three other
buyers I got buried out back,

210
00:13:02,016 --> 00:13:03,430
then I will crack your head open like an egg!

211
00:13:03,455 --> 00:13:04,736
Stay back! Stay back!
He's crazy.

212
00:13:04,761 --> 00:13:06,012
I told you don't come back here anymore.

213
00:13:06,037 --> 00:13:08,305
I will have my brother come back
and beat your ass!

214
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,498
Don't you start with me.

215
00:13:09,523 --> 00:13:11,055
And I will bring the police when I come, too!

216
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,169
My brother ain't no joke!
Who, Jerry?

217
00:13:13,231 --> 00:13:14,603
You bring his big ass up here,

218
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:17,402
he is gonna be huffing and puffing
before he can squeeze out of that car!

219
00:13:17,521 --> 00:13:19,690
You back out on my grass,
you are gonna be in big trouble!

220
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:23,137
You tell Jerry to come see me.
I will give him some pecan pie.

221
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:24,815
Hey!

222
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:29,870
She smashed through the fence?

223
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:32,466
Cade, relax.

224
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:34,064
You are going to have an aortic infarction.

225
00:13:34,148 --> 00:13:35,054
What is that?

226
00:13:35,274 --> 00:13:37,170
I think it's a brain heart attack.

227
00:13:37,195 --> 00:13:38,488
Yeah, I have had one already.

228
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:39,753
So we are stealing power now?

229
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:41,322
No, we are borrowing it from the neighbors.

230
00:13:41,412 --> 00:13:42,945
Great. That's awesome.

231
00:13:43,908 --> 00:13:46,757
Once I graduate and I am gone,
who is gonna take care of you?

232
00:13:46,782 --> 00:13:48,033
Oh, you take care of me?

233
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:49,947
Who taught you how to solder a circuit?

234
00:13:50,623 --> 00:13:52,595
Or write a program?
Or French braid your hair?

235
00:13:52,622 --> 00:13:54,499
Or throw a spiral? Me.
That's what I do.

236
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:56,170
Who taught you how to cook without ketchup,

237
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:57,918
or balance your checkbook?

238
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:02,676
Who always has to be
the grownup around here?

239
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:05,875
Alright, you got a point, ok?

240
00:14:05,899 --> 00:14:07,339
But that means we are a great team.

241
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:09,573
And I know it's been sucky
around here lately.

242
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:11,172
But we are gonna be fine, sweetie.

243
00:14:11,196 --> 00:14:12,770
You just got to keep believing, ok?

244
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:14,188
I mean, that's what great inventors do.

245
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,551
I promise you one day,

246
00:14:15,793 --> 00:14:17,431
I am gonna build something that matters.

247
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:21,485
I believe you, Dad.

248
00:14:23,364 --> 00:14:25,658
You know, your mom would be
very proud of you.

249
00:14:27,535 --> 00:14:28,842
It's going to be ok.

250
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:02,278
Spread out!
Push right!

251
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:03,529
Roll, roll, roll, roll.

252
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:05,114
Give me two. Give me two.

253
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:07,157
Take the beach, nice and easy.

254
00:15:08,993 --> 00:15:10,304
<i>Alright, hold what you got.</i>

255
00:15:12,371 --> 00:15:13,622
Release the mini-drones.

256
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:32,800
<i>Vipers. Eagle in sight.
Cleared hot.</i>

257
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:36,298
Got a heat sig.

258
00:15:36,698 --> 00:15:38,689
Second stack.
Closest to the bow.

259
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:41,150
<i>Predator 0-1.
Captured target area.</i>

260
00:15:41,267 --> 00:15:42,268
<i>Set charges.</i>

261
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:49,562
Leader, leader, this is Gunfighter 0-1.

262
00:15:49,586 --> 00:15:51,758
Eagles moving internal. Second deck.

263
00:15:54,673 --> 00:15:56,747
Frogman 83, Frogman 83.

264
00:16:18,885 --> 00:16:20,220
Breached site on rooftop.

265
00:16:20,256 --> 00:16:22,675
Breached site on rooftop.
Have Echo Platoon on standby.

266
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:24,917
Let the Helo know we are moving external!

267
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:30,805
<i>Alpha, take port.
Bravo, take starboard.</i>

268
00:16:31,549 --> 00:16:33,051
<i>Shift right.
Shift right.</i>

269
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,286
Cracking steel!

270
00:16:45,578 --> 00:16:46,335
No!

271
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,491
Hit him, hit him, hit him!

272
00:16:51,804 --> 00:16:52,593
Fire.

273
00:16:53,414 --> 00:16:55,141
<i>Missiles out.
Danger close.</i>

274
00:16:58,477 --> 00:16:59,681
He is running! Move!

275
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,017
<i>He is on the run!
He is on the run!</i>

276
00:17:16,221 --> 00:17:17,024
No!

277
00:17:17,313 --> 00:17:18,307
Please!

278
00:17:18,914 --> 00:17:20,135
Hold your fire.

279
00:17:22,696 --> 00:17:24,909
Hold! Hold fire!

280
00:17:26,188 --> 00:17:28,050
Can you not see?
I have been injured.

281
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,620
<i>Box him in.</i>

282
00:17:30,152 --> 00:17:30,984
<i>Box him in.</i>

283
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:32,330
Medical Officer Ratchet!

284
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:34,331
I am a friend!

285
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:39,560
I am an Autobot!

286
00:17:40,063 --> 00:17:41,297
Why are you running?

287
00:17:41,812 --> 00:17:44,398
Optimus sent this distress message.

288
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:46,316
<i>Calling all Autobots.</i>

289
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,347
<i>We are under targeted attack.</i>

290
00:17:48,464 --> 00:17:50,516
<i>Cease all contact with humans.</i>

291
00:17:50,738 --> 00:17:52,351
We are all hiding.

292
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:54,908
All Autobots are being hunted.

293
00:17:55,163 --> 00:17:56,743
We are all in danger.

294
00:17:56,952 --> 00:17:58,709
I lost a sister in Chicago.

295
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:00,929
You will get no sympathy from me.

296
00:18:14,584 --> 00:18:16,669
What's wrong with you humans?

297
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:25,918
No! Please.

298
00:18:30,861 --> 00:18:32,529
Check fire, check fire!

299
00:18:43,613 --> 00:18:45,837
He is mine now.

300
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:48,796
Lockdown.

301
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:51,632
Autobots, Decepticons.

302
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:53,245
Like little children,

303
00:18:53,764 --> 00:18:56,162
always fighting.

304
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,850
Making a mess out of the universe.

305
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:01,598
Then I have got to clean it up.

306
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:03,942
There is one way you survive.

307
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:06,090
Tell me where he is hiding.

308
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:07,217
Where...

309
00:19:07,748 --> 00:19:09,606
is Optimus Prime?

310
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:12,017
Never.

311
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:23,038
Never is here.

312
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:33,674
I must say, it is remarkable,

313
00:19:33,699 --> 00:19:36,202
really astounding,
the success that the CIA has had

314
00:19:36,227 --> 00:19:38,062
since you have taken operational control,

315
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:42,002
and so the President has asked me
to ask you to ask...

316
00:19:42,918 --> 00:19:44,449
him, to invite you both...

317
00:19:44,778 --> 00:19:47,512
over to the White House just to powwow,

318
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:50,552
where we get maybe some
more specifics...

319
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,325
about how...

320
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:55,988
exactly you are hunting
the enemy Decepticons left.

321
00:19:57,131 --> 00:19:58,520
I have had my desk for two years.

322
00:19:58,545 --> 00:20:00,843
Mr. Attinger has been here for 25.

323
00:20:00,868 --> 00:20:04,053
He runs the projects where
I don't ask for specifics.

324
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:06,206
That's why they are called Black Ops.

325
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:08,792
And why we all sleep better at night.

326
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:10,765
Check. That is great. So...

327
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:15,285
Any dirt on that?

328
00:20:15,309 --> 00:20:16,120
How...

329
00:20:16,527 --> 00:20:17,427
how that's going?

330
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:20,482
Outstanding.

331
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:22,014
Great. Oh, great.

332
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:23,891
I was hoping to hear that.
The President will be pleased.

333
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:26,213
Because, I will tell you
right now, I have only been

334
00:20:26,237 --> 00:20:27,745
Chief of Staff since Monday.

335
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:31,510
But I do know that the alien
war stuff, these are...

336
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,565
These are the only fun meetings.

337
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:36,320
Look, I am not here
to entertain the President,

338
00:20:36,426 --> 00:20:37,599
but you may tell him,

339
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:39,841
that the war will be over...

340
00:20:40,695 --> 00:20:41,435
soon.

341
00:20:42,718 --> 00:20:44,606
Be over... In case he asks, I...

342
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:46,900
just like to have an exact quote.
War will be over soon.

343
00:20:46,924 --> 00:20:49,338
That is great. Such good news. And...

344
00:20:49,954 --> 00:20:53,002
the President would, I know, just love...

345
00:20:53,045 --> 00:20:54,616
Really, really love the...

346
00:20:54,699 --> 00:20:57,494
press the flesh, I got not flesh,
obviously but just the...

347
00:20:57,518 --> 00:20:58,967
maybe get a shot with...

348
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:00,503
Is it Lord Prime? Sir Prime?

349
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:03,250
We could... bop on Air Force One.
It would be just a quick bop,

350
00:21:03,274 --> 00:21:05,508
then we just bop in and bop back.
I would not get his hopes up on that one.

351
00:21:05,925 --> 00:21:06,391
Ok.

352
00:21:06,516 --> 00:21:08,226
He is called Optimus Prime.

353
00:21:08,518 --> 00:21:09,590
Alien combatant.

354
00:21:10,414 --> 00:21:11,521
Here illegally.

355
00:21:12,064 --> 00:21:12,718
But...

356
00:21:13,642 --> 00:21:14,595
are not they our friends?

357
00:21:15,518 --> 00:21:16,288
Why?

358
00:21:16,313 --> 00:21:18,392
Because our world will never
truly be safe...

359
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,782
till all of them are gone.

360
00:21:22,252 --> 00:21:22,895
Well...

361
00:21:23,317 --> 00:21:26,341
I would hope we could do
a much more ceremonial farewell.

362
00:21:26,366 --> 00:21:28,890
Especially since our military has
worked so closely with them.

363
00:21:29,623 --> 00:21:31,429
Until you.
It's not their planet.

364
00:21:31,454 --> 00:21:32,538
Never was.

365
00:21:35,488 --> 00:21:37,054
Time we take it back.

366
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:48,629
Alright, come on.

367
00:21:49,012 --> 00:21:50,262
Come on.

368
00:21:50,936 --> 00:21:51,632
Yes.

369
00:21:52,543 --> 00:21:53,280
Yes.

370
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:54,752
Yes.

371
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:57,345
Oh, there you go.

372
00:21:57,655 --> 00:21:58,666
No, hold it.

373
00:21:59,277 --> 00:22:00,265
Stop shaking!

374
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:01,994
Why are you shaking?

375
00:22:02,535 --> 00:22:03,666
You have the job!

376
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,849
You forgot to eat dinner!

377
00:22:08,078 --> 00:22:09,672
You see why I worry?

378
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:14,212
Look, sorry sweetie, I...

379
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,868
I almost got it working right.

380
00:22:17,796 --> 00:22:18,784
So, listen,

381
00:22:19,361 --> 00:22:21,638
I am done with homework
and set with finals so,

382
00:22:21,662 --> 00:22:23,885
I was just gonna take
a little drive with some friends

383
00:22:23,969 --> 00:22:25,086
if that was ok with you.

384
00:22:25,804 --> 00:22:27,542
No boys, I know.

385
00:22:28,094 --> 00:22:29,307
Graduate first.

386
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:30,484
Exactly.

387
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:33,743
You do know no one else has this rule, right?

388
00:22:34,146 --> 00:22:35,008
Rule?

389
00:22:35,032 --> 00:22:37,149
Don't make it sound harsh, ok.
It's wisdom.

390
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:39,809
I don't think we need to be driving
around in the middle of the night.

391
00:22:39,834 --> 00:22:41,920
It's already like quarter to eight.
It's almost dark.

392
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:43,391
Spud, will you stop it?

393
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:46,232
You know where I was for my graduation?

394
00:22:46,618 --> 00:22:48,686
Yes. With me, the mistake.

395
00:22:49,092 --> 00:22:50,274
The surprise, Tess.

396
00:22:50,298 --> 00:22:51,678
And the best thing that ever happened.

397
00:22:51,786 --> 00:22:52,901
Do we look unhappy?

398
00:22:53,592 --> 00:22:55,191
No. It's the greatest day of my life.

399
00:22:56,777 --> 00:22:58,933
I made your mother a promise
before she passed.

400
00:22:59,296 --> 00:23:01,495
Our baby is gonna be at her graduation.
That's it.

401
00:23:02,841 --> 00:23:05,868
Look, high school boys know nothing.
It's only later they turn into men.

402
00:23:06,136 --> 00:23:08,524
So if you were older and wiser,
I would not exist.

403
00:23:09,723 --> 00:23:11,058
That's not what I meant.

404
00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:12,893
You know, this is a non-dating household, ok?

405
00:23:12,918 --> 00:23:14,545
You don't date, I don't date.
That's it.

406
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:16,737
Well, maybe you should.

407
00:23:18,082 --> 00:23:19,120
Tessa, wait.

408
00:23:20,692 --> 00:23:21,735
Tessa?

409
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,199
Look.

410
00:23:25,155 --> 00:23:27,168
I know I have been on you, ok?
But I have to be.

411
00:23:28,658 --> 00:23:31,203
Twelve to seventeen
is the official teenage danger window.

412
00:23:31,286 --> 00:23:32,232
It's my job...

413
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:34,933
to get you through it.
So you can be pissed off all you want.

414
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:40,032
And, yes, you can...

415
00:23:41,103 --> 00:23:42,436
take a ride with your friends.

416
00:23:42,993 --> 00:23:43,905
Ok.

417
00:23:44,536 --> 00:23:45,733
Don't work all night.

418
00:23:46,343 --> 00:23:47,272
And eat.

419
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:07,635
Best thing that ever happened, Emily.

420
00:24:08,752 --> 00:24:10,455
She is the best thing that ever happened.

421
00:24:11,576 --> 00:24:12,807
You would be proud.

422
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:20,405
Oh, no.

423
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:29,934
Unbelievable.

424
00:24:31,888 --> 00:24:33,668
Unbelievable. God!

425
00:24:37,948 --> 00:24:40,291
Something in here needs
to make this family some money.

426
00:24:45,569 --> 00:24:46,903
Come on, you old wreck.

427
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:48,322
Judgment Day.

428
00:25:02,602 --> 00:25:03,603
Where is he?

429
00:25:03,898 --> 00:25:04,880
I don't know.

430
00:25:07,069 --> 00:25:08,894
<i>Intruder alert!
Intruder alert!</i>

431
00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:10,178
Asshole.

432
00:25:10,427 --> 00:25:12,233
<i>I am dialing 911.</i>

433
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:17,742
Tess, I am basically your uncle.
<i>Su casa es mi casa.</i>

434
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:19,382
And we are going to lose the <i>casa.</i>

435
00:25:19,936 --> 00:25:20,757
Dad!

436
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:22,375
Coming!

437
00:25:23,739 --> 00:25:25,220
Are you working with lasers?

438
00:25:25,244 --> 00:25:26,817
If so, I am not coming in.

439
00:25:26,842 --> 00:25:28,317
You guys have never seen
a truck like this before.

440
00:25:28,342 --> 00:25:29,844
Get in here. Lock that door.

441
00:25:30,113 --> 00:25:31,411
It doesn't have a lock.

442
00:25:32,282 --> 00:25:34,813
Look! Look at the hole in the radiator.
Look at the size of it.

443
00:25:34,968 --> 00:25:36,261
Something blew a hole in it!

444
00:25:36,286 --> 00:25:37,242
Yeah so?

445
00:25:37,267 --> 00:25:38,664
It's not normal steel.

446
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,152
The shrapnel in the engine,

447
00:25:40,603 --> 00:25:42,696
it ripped all the connections apart.
And watch.

448
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,002
And this took some Cade genius.

449
00:25:44,067 --> 00:25:45,501
You are gonna love this.

450
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:48,032
When I hook this back
to a working battery...

451
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:53,240
<i>Calling all...</i>

452
00:25:53,758 --> 00:25:55,865
<i>Calling all Autobots.</i>

453
00:25:56,326 --> 00:25:57,327
Oh, yeah.

454
00:25:57,641 --> 00:25:58,934
I don't think it's a truck at all.

455
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:01,561
I think we just found a Transformer.

456
00:26:01,586 --> 00:26:02,552
Tran...

457
00:26:03,438 --> 00:26:04,509
Evacuate!
Wait!

458
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:06,199
Guys!
Dad...

459
00:26:06,371 --> 00:26:08,877
are you out of your mind?
You need to get that thing out of here.

460
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:09,806
You don't have to worry.

461
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:11,187
I have been in there working all night.
I am fine.

462
00:26:11,212 --> 00:26:12,672
You know what? That's not a truck, ok?
You are right.

463
00:26:12,697 --> 00:26:14,324
It's an alien killing machine.

464
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:15,735
Jesus.
Dude. It's DOA.

465
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,017
It's been recalled, totaled, done.

466
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:19,002
So, listen, there is a number that you call.

467
00:26:19,027 --> 00:26:20,901
You are supposed to call the government.

468
00:26:20,925 --> 00:26:22,533
It's the American thing to do.

469
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:24,310
Here we go.
You are supposed to call,

470
00:26:24,357 --> 00:26:25,599
and if it ends up being alien,

471
00:26:25,624 --> 00:26:27,325
then you win $25,000.

472
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:29,336
You don't win money.
And if you can capture it live...

473
00:26:29,479 --> 00:26:31,203
Like tag it like a wild wildebeest,

474
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,755
then you get $100,000.

475
00:26:32,926 --> 00:26:34,475
Dad, we are making the call.
I heard that.

476
00:26:34,511 --> 00:26:35,957
I have seen the commercial.
They don't say that.

477
00:26:35,981 --> 00:26:37,041
That's not a guarantee.
You need to call Dad.

478
00:26:37,066 --> 00:26:38,213
You think Greg would lie to me?

479
00:26:38,238 --> 00:26:40,385
Look, if that's a Transformer
there from the Battle of Chicago,

480
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:41,862
I need to know how it works.

481
00:26:42,185 --> 00:26:43,340
I am an inventor.

482
00:26:43,364 --> 00:26:44,854
This could be a game changer for me!

483
00:26:44,938 --> 00:26:46,773
If I can apply that technology
to my inventions,

484
00:26:46,856 --> 00:26:48,441
we would never have to worry
about money again.

485
00:26:48,466 --> 00:26:49,774
I have heard that before.

486
00:26:50,805 --> 00:26:53,515
Twenty-five grand! It pays for my college.
It pays for the house.

487
00:26:53,613 --> 00:26:55,687
Besides, you used my money
to buy the truck, right?

488
00:26:55,865 --> 00:26:57,771
So technically, that's my truck.

489
00:26:58,092 --> 00:26:59,082
Don't you think?

490
00:27:00,328 --> 00:27:02,910
You also signed a contract
regarding all research lab I.P.

491
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,208
Research lab? It's a barn, dude.

492
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:09,032
You signed it...

493
00:27:09,165 --> 00:27:10,246
and now you are competing.

494
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,868
Any idea of yours is mine.

495
00:27:11,892 --> 00:27:13,428
Any thought you have, I own it,

496
00:27:13,453 --> 00:27:14,954
so basically, I own you.

497
00:27:15,218 --> 00:27:17,067
I don't think you can own someone.

498
00:27:17,345 --> 00:27:19,514
That was like a while ago, even in Texas.

499
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:21,253
Alright.

500
00:27:21,277 --> 00:27:23,115
Bring the torch over
and help me with the pulley arm.

501
00:27:24,894 --> 00:27:26,904
I think the shrapnel took out its power core.

502
00:27:27,443 --> 00:27:28,974
And Tessa, you see this?

503
00:27:32,235 --> 00:27:34,307
Would an alien killing machine
let me do that?

504
00:27:34,612 --> 00:27:36,006
Look, I will make the call.

505
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:38,104
We will get the money.
Just first let me see if I am right.

506
00:27:38,308 --> 00:27:40,081
You want to hide in the house?
Go ahead.

507
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,961
Ok.

508
00:27:42,645 --> 00:27:43,687
Let's go. Pulley arm.

509
00:27:46,124 --> 00:27:47,552
I can't believe him!

510
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:49,948
What is that?

511
00:27:50,365 --> 00:27:51,590
Looks like a missile.

512
00:27:51,629 --> 00:27:52,839
It is!

513
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,136
Dad!

514
00:28:08,563 --> 00:28:09,887
There is a missile...

515
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:11,480
in the family room!

516
00:28:12,395 --> 00:28:13,477
Holy...

517
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:19,032
I will kill you!

518
00:28:23,745 --> 00:28:25,705
No! No!

519
00:28:27,665 --> 00:28:29,000
Dad, there is a missile in...

520
00:28:33,588 --> 00:28:35,118
I will kill you!

521
00:28:35,423 --> 00:28:36,246
Stay back!
Oh no!

522
00:28:36,271 --> 00:28:39,278
Don't shoot. Don't shoot!
Call 911! Run!

523
00:28:39,904 --> 00:28:41,512
Lucas!
Stop!

524
00:28:45,183 --> 00:28:47,393
Lucas? Don't move, just calm down.

525
00:28:49,979 --> 00:28:52,503
Easy, human.

526
00:28:53,441 --> 00:28:54,471
Stay there.

527
00:28:54,495 --> 00:28:55,800
He is not going to hurt us.

528
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,072
Weapons systems damaged.

529
00:28:59,097 --> 00:29:00,390
A missile hit your engine.

530
00:29:01,157 --> 00:29:02,395
And we took it out of you.

531
00:29:03,082 --> 00:29:04,430
You are hurt really bad.

532
00:29:06,371 --> 00:29:07,633
I am just trying to help you.

533
00:29:07,956 --> 00:29:09,305
You are in my home now.
I am an engineer.

534
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,681
My name is Cade Yeager.

535
00:29:11,336 --> 00:29:12,530
Cade,

536
00:29:12,912 --> 00:29:14,781
I am in your debt.

537
00:29:15,797 --> 00:29:18,633
My name is Optimus Prime.

538
00:29:19,634 --> 00:29:20,934
My Autobots.

539
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,489
They are in danger.

540
00:29:27,684 --> 00:29:28,922
I need to go.

541
00:29:29,188 --> 00:29:30,547
I need to go now.

542
00:29:30,775 --> 00:29:32,443
How far you think you are gonna get?

543
00:29:33,857 --> 00:29:35,391
Tessa, come here.
He needs our help.

544
00:29:37,694 --> 00:29:38,683
What happened to you?

545
00:29:39,186 --> 00:29:40,475
An ambush.

546
00:29:40,499 --> 00:29:41,434
A trap.

547
00:29:42,082 --> 00:29:43,866
Set by humans.

548
00:29:47,669 --> 00:29:50,280
I escaped and took this form.

549
00:29:50,758 --> 00:29:52,134
But you are on our side.

550
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:54,002
Why would humans hurt you?

551
00:29:54,085 --> 00:29:56,648
They were not alone.

552
00:29:57,547 --> 00:29:58,910
My Autobots...

553
00:29:59,246 --> 00:30:01,121
can repair me.

554
00:30:01,394 --> 00:30:02,164
Yeah.

555
00:30:03,094 --> 00:30:04,320
If you can reach them.

556
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:12,360
What about me?

557
00:30:34,918 --> 00:30:37,086
I warn you, Mr. Attinger of Earth,

558
00:30:38,087 --> 00:30:39,743
an alliance is a contract,

559
00:30:40,111 --> 00:30:41,434
and contracts,

560
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:42,949
like humans,

561
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,595
expire.

562
00:30:45,964 --> 00:30:47,488
On this planet we have a saying.

563
00:30:48,598 --> 00:30:50,808
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

564
00:30:51,137 --> 00:30:52,893
I also have a saying.

565
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:55,355
I don't care.

566
00:30:57,273 --> 00:30:58,733
So what happened in Mexico City?

567
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:00,068
I thought you had him.

568
00:31:00,093 --> 00:31:01,139
Three direct hits.

569
00:31:01,163 --> 00:31:02,265
A mortal wound.

570
00:31:02,289 --> 00:31:04,723
Then your men allowed him to escape.

571
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:07,825
You promised me human intelligence.

572
00:31:08,201 --> 00:31:10,241
Or is there such a thing?

573
00:31:11,162 --> 00:31:12,624
You know, you have still never told me.

574
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:15,375
Why do you want him?

575
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:16,950
Who are you working for?

576
00:31:17,418 --> 00:31:19,365
Every galaxy I have traveled,

577
00:31:19,536 --> 00:31:21,911
all you species are the same.

578
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:25,349
You all think,
you are the center of the universe.

579
00:31:26,844 --> 00:31:29,151
You have no idea.

580
00:31:31,349 --> 00:31:33,059
Go to the hardware store
and you get the list.

581
00:31:33,084 --> 00:31:34,044
The whole list.

582
00:31:34,069 --> 00:31:35,286
What, you are going to try and fix him?

583
00:31:35,311 --> 00:31:36,604
He is not a model train set, Cade.

584
00:31:36,629 --> 00:31:38,088
No, that's right.
He is important.

585
00:31:38,231 --> 00:31:39,415
Yeah, but important to who?

586
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,359
You can't keep an alien
locked up in your barn.

587
00:31:41,442 --> 00:31:43,640
What are you gonna do, play with him?
Will you calm down?

588
00:31:43,664 --> 00:31:45,968
I am trying to, but I just got hit in
the head with a ten-foot cannon!

589
00:31:46,247 --> 00:31:48,172
If he eats you, I get the GTO.

590
00:31:48,408 --> 00:31:50,054
Not a word to anybody.
Do you hear me?

591
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:51,177
Not a single word.

592
00:31:51,379 --> 00:31:52,356
<i>Nobody.</i>

593
00:31:58,397 --> 00:32:00,108
I think we have a lock on

594
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:03,139
Special Operations group is ready.

595
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,788
What do you got?

596
00:32:04,924 --> 00:32:07,510
Sir, Special Ops just got
a call from Paris, Texas.

597
00:32:07,927 --> 00:32:10,125
Hard match on the truck
seen leaving Mexico City.

598
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:11,209
Son of a bitch.

599
00:32:11,709 --> 00:32:12,828
Let's go get him.

600
00:32:17,437 --> 00:32:18,780
Took a hell of a hit, you know.

601
00:32:18,901 --> 00:32:20,718
The missile just missed
your power source.

602
00:32:22,066 --> 00:32:23,812
We call it a Spark.

603
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:26,224
It contains our life force,

604
00:32:26,248 --> 00:32:28,455
and our memories.

605
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,383
Yeah, we call it a soul.

606
00:32:33,036 --> 00:32:34,321
Scramble Cemetery Wind.

607
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,493
Thank you for your efforts,
ladies and gentlemen.

608
00:32:37,874 --> 00:32:39,110
This room is going dark.

609
00:32:40,543 --> 00:32:42,048
The exit is on your left.

610
00:32:42,205 --> 00:32:43,366
I will take it from here.

611
00:32:43,729 --> 00:32:44,846
Ok, let's go.

612
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:48,115
I am with Cemetery Wind.
We are on the move.

613
00:32:48,551 --> 00:32:49,932
<i>Repeat, on the move.</i>

614
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,503
Cade.

615
00:33:02,357 --> 00:33:04,536
Why are you willing to help me?

616
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:07,669
I guess maybe because you trust me to.

617
00:33:25,646 --> 00:33:26,647
I am back!

618
00:33:26,716 --> 00:33:28,051
Took you long enough!

619
00:33:28,126 --> 00:33:30,663
My head hurts. I had to go to the doctor.
I got a...

620
00:33:30,956 --> 00:33:32,332
welt on my head that makes me look

621
00:33:32,495 --> 00:33:34,049
like a fricking Star Trek character.

622
00:33:34,414 --> 00:33:35,414
Whatever.

623
00:33:45,608 --> 00:33:47,193
Look! Look!

624
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:03,459
<i>We are on property.</i>

626
00:34:19,767 --> 00:34:20,768
Dad!

627
00:35:02,435 --> 00:35:05,521
Mr. Yeager, my name is James Savoy.
I am a federal agent.

628
00:35:05,605 --> 00:35:07,858
My men and I are trying
to track down an...

629
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:09,140
abandoned truck.

630
00:35:13,949 --> 00:35:15,351
It's a nice spread you got here.

631
00:35:15,976 --> 00:35:17,148
Too bad she is for sale.

632
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:19,015
Well, thanks. She is not.

633
00:35:20,405 --> 00:35:21,602
That the truck you mean?

634
00:35:23,289 --> 00:35:24,281
Afraid not.

635
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:27,155
You know, Mr. Yeager,
we received a call

636
00:35:27,179 --> 00:35:29,047
from someone concerned about this truck.

637
00:35:29,072 --> 00:35:30,073
Oh, no.

638
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:31,547
That was not you?

639
00:35:32,715 --> 00:35:35,474
Only thing I am concerned about is you
being on my property without permission.

640
00:35:35,927 --> 00:35:38,474
You know, we got a rule about people
messing with people from Texas.

641
00:35:39,055 --> 00:35:40,693
And I don't know what truck
you are talking about.

642
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:42,934
The kind that cost American lives.

643
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:44,505
Search the property!

644
00:35:44,529 --> 00:35:46,608
What do you mean, search the property?
You don't have a warrant.

645
00:35:47,104 --> 00:35:48,933
My face, is my warrant.

646
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:52,388
Wait. But if you guys do find a truck,

647
00:35:52,412 --> 00:35:53,657
we get a reward, right?

648

Clear right.

659
00:36:18,427 --> 00:36:19,428
Clear.

660
00:36:19,595 --> 00:36:22,173
360.720.
Heads on a swivel.

661
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,760
Let's go. There is nothing here.

662
00:36:38,531 --> 00:36:40,449
There is no signs.
We got nothing.

663
00:36:40,571 --> 00:36:42,865
Sir, we have a live armed missile in the trash.

664
00:36:43,202 --> 00:36:44,148
Live?

665
00:36:44,172 --> 00:36:47,127
I carried that to the trash!
You told me that was a dud, dude.

666
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,296
I could be dead. Right?

667
00:36:51,091 --> 00:36:51,831
Look.

668
00:36:52,065 --> 00:36:53,743
Ok, yes, I found a truck, alright.

669
00:36:53,768 --> 00:36:54,810
I towed it back for the parts.

670
00:36:54,835 --> 00:36:56,628
I left it here last night.
This morning, it's gone.

671
00:36:56,796 --> 00:36:58,158
When? Where? I don't know.
I swear to God.

672
00:36:58,183 --> 00:36:59,655
That's as much as I know about him.

673
00:36:59,812 --> 00:37:00,773
Him.

674
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:04,312
He said, Him.

675
00:37:05,057 --> 00:37:06,640
<i>He knows who the son of a bitch is.</i>

676
00:37:08,801 --> 00:37:09,924
Mr. Yeager.

677
00:37:10,143 --> 00:37:11,689
What?
Excuse me.

678
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,571
You just said, Him.

679
00:37:16,485 --> 00:37:17,941
Take them down.
What?

680
00:37:18,988 --> 00:37:20,488
Let me go!

681
00:37:20,513 --> 00:37:23,285
They don't know about the truck!
I know! Just let her go.

682
00:37:23,942 --> 00:37:25,985
What kind of a man betrays
his flesh-and-blood

683
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,590
brethren for alien metal?

684
00:37:27,955 --> 00:37:29,134
Get this guy out of my sight.

685
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:31,056
Let her go!
They don't know about the truck.

686
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:32,333
Alright! Load up!

687
00:37:32,545 --> 00:37:34,543
Search the perimeter!
Lucas you called, didn't you?

688
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,957
No! I don't know any
of these scary guys.

689
00:37:36,982 --> 00:37:39,746
Oh, God! You are manhandling a woman!
I will kick your ass!

690
00:37:39,771 --> 00:37:41,043
Let her go!

691
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,508
Daddy!
You are not going anywhere.

692
00:37:43,533 --> 00:37:44,594
Let me go!

693
00:37:44,781 --> 00:37:45,867
Daddy!

694
00:37:46,398 --> 00:37:48,265
No! You are not taking me anywhere!

695
00:37:48,464 --> 00:37:49,507
I am an American!

696
00:37:50,899 --> 00:37:52,330
Easy, sweetheart.
Ok, ok, ok.

697
00:37:52,355 --> 00:37:53,269
Alright. Ok.

698
00:37:53,293 --> 00:37:54,523
Alright.
I was wrong.

699
00:37:55,013 --> 00:37:55,803
Savoy.

700
00:37:56,759 --> 00:37:57,805
Use the girl.

701
00:37:58,047 --> 00:37:59,282
Oh, my God!

702
00:38:05,201 --> 00:38:06,814
Now, you got ten seconds.

703
00:38:07,181 --> 00:38:08,380
Where is the truck?

704
00:38:11,923 --> 00:38:14,008
You are gonna shoot my little girl?
If I have to.

705
00:38:14,205 --> 00:38:15,206
Please don't shoot me! Please!

706
00:38:15,437 --> 00:38:17,283
Look, I don't know.
I told you everything that I know!

707
00:38:17,533 --> 00:38:19,972
He is gone. He left.
He was in the barn, I swear to God!

708
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:21,581
<i>Just let her go!</i>

709
00:38:21,981 --> 00:38:23,149
Please, please.

710
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:24,624
He was in there!

711
00:38:24,648 --> 00:38:25,613
Let her go!

712
00:38:25,638 --> 00:38:26,813
Seven seconds.

713
00:38:27,014 --> 00:38:29,524
I am telling you the truth!
He was in there!

714
00:38:32,173 --> 00:38:33,174
Dad!

715
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:35,552
Tell him to get away
from my little girl now!

716
00:38:37,191 --> 00:38:38,505
Dad!

717
00:38:39,458 --> 00:38:40,653
You touch her and I will kill you!

718
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,073
You got two seconds.

719
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,825
I need the truth.

720
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:48,084
Please.
Shoot her.

721
00:39:02,425 --> 00:39:04,593
Here I am!

722
00:39:09,432 --> 00:39:10,516
Get down!

723
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:11,420
Cade!

724
00:39:11,444 --> 00:39:13,172
They are going to kill you!

725
00:39:13,281 --> 00:39:14,871
Get out of here!

726
00:39:28,617 --> 00:39:29,951
Push right! Headed to the house!

727
00:39:43,007 --> 00:39:44,567
Come on. Hurry up!
Get in the car!

728
00:39:44,592 --> 00:39:45,913
Let's go!
Daddy, get in the car!

729
00:39:54,393 --> 00:39:56,195
Perimeter, Optimus moving your way!

730
00:40:18,049 --> 00:40:19,473
What's happening, baby?
Who are they?

731
00:40:19,498 --> 00:40:21,500
It's the truck. They want the truck!

732
00:40:21,629 --> 00:40:24,088
Who are they? Who are you,
and who are you calling baby?

733
00:40:25,216 --> 00:40:26,217
I know you heard me.

734
00:40:26,242 --> 00:40:27,933
I am her boyfriend!
He is my boyfriend!

735
00:40:28,052 --> 00:40:28,873
What?

736
00:40:29,122 --> 00:40:30,605
You are not her boyfriend!

737
00:40:30,721 --> 00:40:32,973
His name is Shane and he drives Dad.

738
00:40:37,311 --> 00:40:38,799
What kind of cars are those?

739
00:40:39,033 --> 00:40:40,441
They are so scary!

740
00:40:44,151 --> 00:40:45,588
There is another one coming up the back!

741
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:50,338
You got to try to lose them in the cornfield!

742
00:41:14,348 --> 00:41:15,574
He is coming up behind us! Go!

743
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:17,449
<i>Viper 15, running on fumes. RTB.</i>

744
00:41:24,864 --> 00:41:26,005
They ave got us cornered!

745
00:41:28,143 --> 00:41:29,519
Watch out, watch out, watch out!

746
00:41:37,892 --> 00:41:40,282
Mr. Yeager, this is not how
I wanted us to meet, ok?

747
00:41:40,307 --> 00:41:41,725
I am Shane and I am a completely...

748
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,811
And I am not talking to you!
Drive the car!

749
00:41:44,609 --> 00:41:45,781
Watch out!
Watch out!

750
00:41:56,419 --> 00:41:57,946
<i>Throw them some warning shots!</i>

751
00:42:03,856 --> 00:42:05,580
Man, I don't know how
I am driving this good.

752
00:42:05,605 --> 00:42:07,566
It's like, today I have gone
to a whole other level.

753
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:09,004
Road, focus! Stop talking!

754
00:42:11,238 --> 00:42:12,309
Shane, look out!

755
00:42:18,761 --> 00:42:20,871
This may be primarily my fault, ok.

756
00:42:20,896 --> 00:42:22,272
They said they were gonna bring a check!

757
00:42:22,297 --> 00:42:24,062
I didn't know they were gonna send
a death squad!

758
00:42:33,427 --> 00:42:34,349
Hang on!

759
00:42:36,073 --> 00:42:38,116
Hey, we got ourselves a winner!
Don's got it over here.

760
00:42:38,349 --> 00:42:39,350
Look out!

761
00:42:45,321 --> 00:42:46,263
We lost them!

762
00:42:46,638 --> 00:42:48,759
Good job, stranger from the cornfields.

763
00:42:57,290 --> 00:42:58,650
The scary cars are back.

764
00:43:01,485 --> 00:43:02,820
Lose them at the factory, Shane!

765
00:43:17,164 --> 00:43:19,023
I thought you knew how
to drive this thing! Go!

766
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,007
I don't think we are gonna get that money.

767
00:43:25,226 --> 00:43:26,550
Doesn't seem like it.

768
00:43:35,739 --> 00:43:36,785
Cade!

769
00:43:48,085 --> 00:43:49,164
Take them upstairs!

770
00:43:52,798 --> 00:43:54,216
We are losing them on the fifth floor.

771
00:44:00,848 --> 00:44:02,266
Do that thing, Shane!
You know it.

772
00:44:02,344 --> 00:44:03,372
What do you mean? What thing?

773
00:44:03,397 --> 00:44:04,546
What we are about to do is gonna be...

774
00:44:04,859 --> 00:44:05,787
kind of scary.

775
00:44:07,813 --> 00:44:10,138
Take out your guns and shoot them!

776
00:44:12,786 --> 00:44:13,919
They are shooting at us!

777
00:44:13,944 --> 00:44:15,943
Tessa, grab my stick! Grab my stick!
What?

778
00:44:16,359 --> 00:44:17,888
She is got the best hands in the business.

779
00:44:19,783 --> 00:44:21,513
Ready Tess? Pull!

780
00:44:26,498 --> 00:44:28,787
No! No!
No! No fucking way!

781
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:39,654
Yeah!

782
00:44:41,722 --> 00:44:42,655
Yeah!

783
00:44:42,797 --> 00:44:45,233
Tessa, you are so grounded!

784
00:44:45,851 --> 00:44:47,347
Shit! The rim is cracked.

785
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:50,968
Optimus.

786
00:44:51,308 --> 00:44:52,371
Come on, move! Move!

787
00:44:53,734 --> 00:44:55,110
My foot is stuck! Wait, Cade!

788
00:44:55,194 --> 00:44:56,015
Lucas!

789
00:44:56,406 --> 00:44:57,521
Wait! Wait!

790
00:44:58,572 --> 00:45:00,366
Lucas! Lucas above you!

791
00:45:01,035 --> 00:45:02,100
Run!

792
00:45:28,477 --> 00:45:29,794
Come on, get in, let's go!

793
00:45:33,895 --> 00:45:36,314
<i>I will bet you wish you
could see my face right now.</i>

794
00:46:23,532 --> 00:46:25,070
Lucas, we just left him?

795
00:46:26,368 --> 00:46:27,562
He is gone.

796
00:46:46,054 --> 00:46:48,001
My deepest sympathies...

797
00:46:48,376 --> 00:46:50,084
for the loss of your friend.

798
00:46:50,642 --> 00:46:53,476
Stay here till I am sure
we were not followed.

799
00:46:54,007 --> 00:46:56,531
We are all targets now.

800
00:47:03,906 --> 00:47:05,568
So we are hiding out now?
That's the plan?

801
00:47:06,624 --> 00:47:08,292
We are taking orders from a truck?

802
00:47:08,814 --> 00:47:10,263
Well, you got a better idea?

803
00:47:12,539 --> 00:47:13,235
Hey,

804
00:47:13,344 --> 00:47:14,847
move away from her, kid.
Don't...

805
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:16,823
Keep your hands off her.
Alright? No.

806
00:47:17,753 --> 00:47:21,003
You got your ass kicked
by a garage inventor from Texas.

807
00:47:21,882 --> 00:47:23,425
That goes on your resume.

808
00:47:23,842 --> 00:47:25,636
Yeah, it goes on all of yours too!

809
00:47:25,813 --> 00:47:28,412
Do I look like I am in the mood
for any of your shit today?

810
00:47:30,015 --> 00:47:32,307
Washington thinks we were
chasing a Decepticon target,

811
00:47:32,332 --> 00:47:35,335
but our story falls apart if we don't
find this Yeager family first.

812
00:47:35,812 --> 00:47:38,224
Yeah, well, what if he goes
to the cops or the FBI?

813
00:47:38,249 --> 00:47:39,459
They know to hand him over.

814
00:47:40,275 --> 00:47:41,991
His world as he knows it is gone.

815
00:47:48,705 --> 00:47:49,980
Well, bright side,

816
00:47:50,246 --> 00:47:51,344
you guys met.

817
00:47:53,121 --> 00:47:54,164
Where is he from?

818
00:47:54,706 --> 00:47:56,768
I told you, he is a driver from Texas.

819
00:47:56,793 --> 00:47:57,659
Texas?

820
00:47:58,648 --> 00:48:00,483
Where, Dublin, Texas?
Shamrock, Texas?

821
00:48:00,508 --> 00:48:01,916
So why does he sound like a leprechaun?

822
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:04,525
You would get your ass kicked
in Ireland for saying that.

823
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:06,691
Well, we are not in Ireland, Lucky Charms.
We are in Texas.

824
00:48:07,844 --> 00:48:09,425
And so he drives?
What do you mean, he drives?

825
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:10,584
Like, for a living?
Yeah.

826
00:48:11,706 --> 00:48:13,120
At least he makes a living.

827
00:48:13,809 --> 00:48:14,848
Thank you.

828
00:48:15,602 --> 00:48:17,246
Look, I race rally cars.

829
00:48:17,397 --> 00:48:18,254
One driver.

830
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:19,635
One navigator.

831
00:48:19,918 --> 00:48:20,589
Her.

832
00:48:20,899 --> 00:48:22,504
By the way, I am totally legit.

833
00:48:22,776 --> 00:48:24,458
I just got picked up by Red Bull.

834
00:48:25,612 --> 00:48:26,888
And just so you know,

835
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:28,560
my life savings,

836
00:48:28,584 --> 00:48:30,028
was in that car back there.

837
00:48:30,242 --> 00:48:32,497
This is not happening.
Oh, it definitely is.

838
00:48:40,171 --> 00:48:41,276
How old are you?

839
00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:43,291
Twenty.

840
00:48:43,755 --> 00:48:45,507
She's a 17-year-old girl.

841
00:48:45,924 --> 00:48:47,492
So we can work this two ways.

842
00:48:47,759 --> 00:48:50,762
One, I punch you right in the mouth
and you call the police on me.

843
00:48:50,994 --> 00:48:52,196
Dad.
Or two...

844
00:48:53,015 --> 00:48:55,742
I just call the cops on you because
this is illegal. She is a minor.

845
00:48:55,767 --> 00:48:57,519
We are protected by
the Romeo and Juliet laws.

846
00:48:57,811 --> 00:48:59,025
We dated for a little while.

847
00:48:59,052 --> 00:49:00,875
I was a sophomore, and he was a senior.
It's fine.

848
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:01,940
No, it's not fine.

849
00:49:01,965 --> 00:49:04,926
We have got a preexisting juvenile
foundational relationship.

850
00:49:05,314 --> 00:49:07,558
Statute 2705-3.

851
00:49:07,684 --> 00:49:08,549
What?

852
00:49:09,114 --> 00:49:10,470
Texas statute?

853
00:49:10,824 --> 00:49:12,075
That a real law?
Yep.

854
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:14,837
Romeo and Juliet?

855
00:49:16,913 --> 00:49:19,207
You know how those two ended up?
In love.

856
00:49:19,366 --> 00:49:19,945
Dead.

857
00:49:20,869 --> 00:49:22,050
Do your parents know about this?

858
00:49:22,310 --> 00:49:24,813
Is your dad ok with you
dating a 17-year-old girl?

859
00:49:24,838 --> 00:49:27,603
He took off when I was five,
but if I ever bump into him, I will ask him.

860
00:49:29,149 --> 00:49:30,197
You know Tessa,

861
00:49:30,927 --> 00:49:31,857
I trusted you.

862
00:49:31,881 --> 00:49:32,971
To what?

863
00:49:33,221 --> 00:49:35,002
Never have fun, take a risk,

864
00:49:35,703 --> 00:49:37,319
be a normal teenager like you?

865
00:49:37,344 --> 00:49:38,446
I am your father, ok?

866
00:49:38,471 --> 00:49:40,789
And I have been busting my ass
to take care of you.

867
00:49:40,896 --> 00:49:42,992
Is that what you were doing when
you brought home the truck?

868
00:49:43,774 --> 00:49:45,804
All you had to do was report it and now...

869
00:49:46,078 --> 00:49:47,466
Lucas is dead.

870
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:49,474
And my life is over.

871
00:49:49,498 --> 00:49:51,740
Thank you.
You have taken real good care of me.

872
00:50:04,086 --> 00:50:05,337
<i>Please don't shoot me!</i>

873
00:50:05,587 --> 00:50:07,195
Please! Dad!

874
00:50:08,507 --> 00:50:09,883
They were willing to kill her.

875
00:50:11,259 --> 00:50:12,421
Then they still are.

876
00:50:15,263 --> 00:50:16,723
Somebody somewhere gave that order.

877
00:50:16,807 --> 00:50:18,309
I am going to find some fingerprints.

878
00:50:22,184 --> 00:50:23,146
<i>Please!</i>

879
00:50:25,607 --> 00:50:26,563
<i>No!</i>

880
00:50:27,301 --> 00:50:28,347
<i>I am an Autobot!</i>

881
00:50:28,496 --> 00:50:29,649
<i>I am an Autobot!</i>

882
00:50:30,529 --> 00:50:32,339
Grab whatever you think
we can use for supplies.

883
00:50:32,364 --> 00:50:33,310
Clothes, anything.

884
00:50:33,529 --> 00:50:34,686
And take that computer.

885
00:50:37,953 --> 00:50:39,287
Let's go.

886
00:50:46,712 --> 00:50:47,904
This is not easy.

887
00:50:48,171 --> 00:50:50,132
You know, you don't suck at everything Dad.

888
00:50:54,539 --> 00:50:55,499
What the...

889
00:51:06,581 --> 00:51:07,510
I knew it.

890
00:51:11,987 --> 00:51:13,213
You told me he was no one.

891
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:15,533
Well,

892
00:51:16,533 --> 00:51:17,947
this no one...

893
00:51:18,611 --> 00:51:20,080
has our tech.

894
00:51:44,227 --> 00:51:45,924
<i>Calling all Autobots.</i>

895
00:51:46,364 --> 00:51:48,199
<i>Calling all Autobots.</i>

896
00:51:58,450 --> 00:51:59,812
Oh, my God!

897
00:52:23,642 --> 00:52:24,643
That was insane!

898
00:52:24,726 --> 00:52:26,516
It was awesome, but it was insane, right?

899
00:52:37,405 --> 00:52:40,004
Oh, yeah! Hell, yeah!

900
00:52:40,909 --> 00:52:41,922
He is back!

901
00:52:42,165 --> 00:52:43,793
He is alive!

902
00:52:44,044 --> 00:52:46,714
Optimus is here!

903
00:52:55,924 --> 00:52:56,995
At last.

904
00:52:57,019 --> 00:52:59,019
There is hope after all.

905
00:53:21,283 --> 00:53:24,452
Mr. Leader of the Free Galaxy is back.

906
00:53:24,786 --> 00:53:27,156
I knew you would make it.
I never doubted.

907
00:53:28,287 --> 00:53:29,569
We got your warning.

908
00:53:29,874 --> 00:53:31,155
We have been waiting.

909
00:53:31,459 --> 00:53:33,280
Hell, yeah. Boom time.

910
00:53:33,812 --> 00:53:35,589
We got the gang back together.

911
00:53:54,524 --> 00:53:57,861
Humans have asked us
to play by their rules.

912
00:53:58,092 --> 00:53:58,974
Well,

913
00:53:59,146 --> 00:54:02,036
the rules have just changed.

914
00:54:02,253 --> 00:54:03,603
Human beings,

915
00:54:03,627 --> 00:54:05,589
bunch of backstabbing weasels.

916
00:54:05,614 --> 00:54:07,999
Hound, find your inner compass.

917
00:54:08,121 --> 00:54:10,026
Loyalty is but a flower

918
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:12,437
in the winds of fear and temptation.

919
00:54:12,461 --> 00:54:13,863
What the hell are you saying?

920
00:54:13,902 --> 00:54:14,865
It's a haiku.

921
00:54:14,889 --> 00:54:17,439
Cut the crap before I drop
a grenade down your throat.

922
00:54:17,464 --> 00:54:19,112
Try it, you will be dead.

923
00:54:19,158 --> 00:54:20,995
Please pull it.
Please do it.

924
00:54:21,343 --> 00:54:23,448
You know what,
it will save us so much time.

925
00:54:23,657 --> 00:54:25,188
Well, raise your hand

926
00:54:25,213 --> 00:54:27,168
if you are thoroughly disenchanted

927
00:54:27,192 --> 00:54:29,730
with
our little pleasant Earth vacation.

928
00:54:29,809 --> 00:54:31,328
So, who is the stowaways?

929
00:54:31,353 --> 00:54:32,753
Oh, hey, what's with the gun?

930
00:54:33,214 --> 00:54:34,664
Stop. Hound, both of you.

931
00:54:34,689 --> 00:54:37,067
They ave risked their lives for mine.

932
00:54:37,734 --> 00:54:39,402
We owe them.

933
00:54:41,083 --> 00:54:43,418
So, there is been no sign of any others?

934
00:54:43,443 --> 00:54:45,691
Nada.
We are all that's left.

935
00:54:45,784 --> 00:54:47,911
They are picking us off, one by one.

936
00:54:47,994 --> 00:54:49,941
We are the pathetic, dirty foursome.

937
00:54:50,558 --> 00:54:52,072
And you make five.

938
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:54,978
So that's our best-case scenario?

939
00:54:56,127 --> 00:54:57,752
Autobot witness protection?

940
00:54:58,915 --> 00:55:01,266
Hey Speed Racer,
you are welcome to leave anytime.

941
00:55:01,299 --> 00:55:03,860
Well, for the record, Superdad,

942
00:55:04,469 --> 00:55:05,790
I am not hiding with you.

943
00:55:06,063 --> 00:55:07,806
I am hiding out with that big guy.

944
00:55:08,223 --> 00:55:10,596
Sensei, with your fate unknown,

945
00:55:10,621 --> 00:55:12,667
Bumblebee has held command,

946
00:55:12,692 --> 00:55:15,782
despite his complete
and total lack of anything

947
00:55:15,807 --> 00:55:18,088
resembling warrior discipline.

948
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,585
He is like a child.

949
00:55:19,610 --> 00:55:21,228
This child is about to kick your ass.

950
00:55:21,253 --> 00:55:22,797
He brings us shame.

951
00:55:24,948 --> 00:55:26,025
Cage fight.

952
00:55:26,574 --> 00:55:27,575
Smartass.

953
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,351
What's the matter with them?

954
00:55:31,079 --> 00:55:32,651
Am I the lone sage

955
00:55:32,675 --> 00:55:35,028
who sees through this puppy-dog eyes act.

956
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:36,496
It's beneath you.

957
00:55:36,521 --> 00:55:37,122
Yes,

958
00:55:37,146 --> 00:55:39,274
I have been waiting for them
all to dispatch each other,

959
00:55:39,299 --> 00:55:41,384
so I could take charge with no trouble at all.

960
00:55:41,409 --> 00:55:43,380
Just me reporting to me.

961
00:55:43,508 --> 00:55:45,051
Well, it sure looks like you have been missed.

962
00:55:45,135 --> 00:55:46,122
Autobots.

963
00:55:46,521 --> 00:55:48,629
Lockdown is hunting us,

964
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:51,099
and humans are helping.

965
00:55:51,516 --> 00:55:53,518
We need to know why.

966
00:55:53,893 --> 00:55:56,309
Well listen, I don't know why,
but I have an idea about who.

967
00:55:59,691 --> 00:56:02,419
This drone I stole recorded footage
of an Autobot raid.

968
00:56:04,521 --> 00:56:06,895
It's in pieces,
but watch what happens here.

969
00:56:08,324 --> 00:56:10,118
Oh, that's Leadfoot.

970
00:56:10,368 --> 00:56:11,564
They rip him apart.

971
00:56:11,589 --> 00:56:12,604
Savages.

972
00:56:13,663 --> 00:56:15,498
And later,
this truck comes to haul him off.

973
00:56:15,523 --> 00:56:16,900
KSI. Kinetic Solutions.

974
00:56:17,083 --> 00:56:18,906
Defense, aerospace, government contracts.

975
00:56:19,627 --> 00:56:21,071
They designed this drone.

976
00:56:21,604 --> 00:56:23,305
So these government guys
just hunt you down and then

977
00:56:23,330 --> 00:56:25,064
pass you off to this KSI?

978
00:56:25,775 --> 00:56:27,485
The company is headquartered in Chicago.

979
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:28,854
That could be where they were taken.

980
00:56:29,032 --> 00:56:31,088
No way to get inside without a battle.

981
00:56:31,253 --> 00:56:31,972
Well,

982
00:56:32,231 --> 00:56:33,753
what if you had some human help?

983
00:56:34,008 --> 00:56:35,547
What, are you two partners now?
Sweetie.

984
00:56:35,711 --> 00:56:38,398
We are targets now too. We need to know
why or we will never get our lives back.

985
00:56:39,064 --> 00:56:40,320
Autobots,

986
00:56:40,482 --> 00:56:42,938
I have sworn to never kill humans.

987
00:56:43,151 --> 00:56:44,330
Big mistake?

988
00:56:44,486 --> 00:56:46,791
But when I find out who is behind this,

989
00:56:47,906 --> 00:56:49,908
he is going to die.

990
00:57:05,465 --> 00:57:07,217
<i>There is a full-on manhunt out for us,</i>

991
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:08,676
<i>so we have some new rules.</i>

992
00:57:08,927 --> 00:57:10,965
<i>Anyone who has got a badge
is not our friend.</i>

993
00:57:11,346 --> 00:57:12,847
<i>We are gonna divide and conquer.</i>

994
00:57:13,181 --> 00:57:16,059
<i>You two in charge of stealing food
and the essentials. And nothing else.</i>

995
00:57:22,899 --> 00:57:25,110
<i>Chicago KSI headquarters
is like a fortress.</i>

996
00:57:25,193 --> 00:57:27,278
<i>I am gonna find a way into their
top-secret military wing.</i>

997
00:57:27,362 --> 00:57:29,948
<i>Find something to blackmail this
company and the government.</i>

998
00:57:30,031 --> 00:57:31,775
<i>We are gonna get our freedom back.</i>

999
00:57:40,667 --> 00:57:42,794
Good morning, Mr. Joyce.

1000
00:57:48,883 --> 00:57:49,989
What was that sound?

1001
00:57:50,385 --> 00:57:52,379
That's the sound.

1002
00:57:52,679 --> 00:57:53,888
That you asked for.

1003
00:57:55,390 --> 00:57:56,336
No, I asked for...

1004
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:57,253
boundless...

1005
00:57:57,507 --> 00:57:58,593
transcendent.

1006
00:57:58,827 --> 00:58:00,200
When you walk through a door
in this building,

1007
00:58:00,225 --> 00:58:02,280
it should sound like you have
stepped into the future.

1008
00:58:08,736 --> 00:58:09,821
Present.

1009
00:58:14,075 --> 00:58:15,055
Say it.

1010
00:58:15,493 --> 00:58:16,578
Future.

1011
00:58:17,245 --> 00:58:18,923
<i>The past is history.</i>

1012
00:58:19,099 --> 00:58:20,748
<i>The present is past.</i>

1013
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,716
<i>The future is now.</i>

1014
00:58:22,741 --> 00:58:24,467
Why can't I get in touch with you?

1015
00:58:26,462 --> 00:58:28,923
Don't you realize
what the Arctic find means?

1016
00:58:30,091 --> 00:58:32,594
You know that story
we were all told as children

1017
00:58:32,677 --> 00:58:34,971
about a giant asteroid that struck the Earth

1018
00:58:34,996 --> 00:58:37,374
millions of years ago
and wiped out the dinosaurs?

1019
00:58:37,515 --> 00:58:39,326
Vaguely.
We were wrong.

1020
00:58:40,185 --> 00:58:42,429
This metal caused the great extinction.

1021
00:58:43,062 --> 00:58:44,741
How and why, I can't yet say.

1022
00:58:44,770 --> 00:58:48,023
But carbon dating puts it
at 65 million years B.C.

1023
00:58:48,401 --> 00:58:51,779
This ore you have got us digging for is
a lot more dangerous than you think.

1024
00:58:51,863 --> 00:58:53,059
And my people...
Darcy.

1025
00:58:53,472 --> 00:58:56,300
I think that you have been
out in the field for far too long.

1026
00:58:57,619 --> 00:58:59,659
Why don't we discuss dinosaurs over dinner?

1027
00:59:00,455 --> 00:59:02,147
Ribs?
Not a chance.

1028
00:59:03,458 --> 00:59:05,709
You have no idea
what's been happening here.

1029
00:59:07,295 --> 00:59:09,172
We are about to make the quantum leap.

1030
00:59:10,381 --> 00:59:11,998
A rare earth metal.

1031
00:59:12,842 --> 00:59:14,844
Molecularly unstable.

1032
00:59:15,178 --> 00:59:16,624
Industrial uses...

1033
00:59:16,804 --> 00:59:17,904
none.

1034
00:59:19,474 --> 00:59:20,841
And then the aliens came.

1035
00:59:20,965 --> 00:59:22,325
And we made the connection.

1036
00:59:23,228 --> 00:59:24,809
It's what they are made of.

1037
00:59:25,647 --> 00:59:26,927
<i>It's the Holy Grail.</i>

1038
00:59:27,732 --> 00:59:29,012
Transformium.

1039
00:59:29,248 --> 00:59:31,553
That's what we are calling it.
Focus grouped. Catchy.

1040
00:59:31,649 --> 00:59:32,817
Trademarked.
Yeah.

1041
00:59:33,321 --> 00:59:34,893
This is the greatest advance,

1042
00:59:34,917 --> 00:59:36,349
in modern physics...

1043
00:59:36,532 --> 00:59:38,287
since the splitting of the atom.

1044
00:59:38,409 --> 00:59:40,495
It's programmable matter.

1045
00:59:40,828 --> 00:59:42,734
And now, we have mapped its genome.
I.

1046
00:59:42,758 --> 00:59:44,296
Now you have mapped its genome.

1047
00:59:45,007 --> 00:59:48,367
And now we can begin to give it

1048
00:59:49,087 --> 00:59:50,376
instructions.

1049
00:59:56,552 --> 00:59:58,106
This is extremely good.

1050
00:59:59,261 --> 01:00:00,372
Watch this.

1051
01:00:08,856 --> 01:00:11,857
We can change anything into anything.

1052
01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:17,782
Sensual almost.
Don't you think?

1053
01:00:23,121 --> 01:00:24,387
Do you like music?

1054
01:00:25,832 --> 01:00:26,833
The Pill.

1055
01:00:29,544 --> 01:00:31,671
Perhaps something a little more violent?

1056
01:00:36,551 --> 01:00:38,553
Oh, my God. You have done it.

1057
01:00:38,803 --> 01:00:41,033
In aerospace, the military...

1058
01:00:41,556 --> 01:00:44,475
We will own the entire robotics industry.

1059
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:45,806
All exploration.

1060
01:00:46,227 --> 01:00:47,193
The oceans.

1061
01:00:47,376 --> 01:00:48,258
Space.

1062
01:00:48,577 --> 01:00:49,400
Everything.

1063
01:00:50,648 --> 01:00:51,552
Wembley.

1064
01:00:51,685 --> 01:00:52,797
What is this?

1065
01:00:52,979 --> 01:00:55,110
The jellyfish commercial that you wanted.

1066
01:00:55,486 --> 01:00:56,516
You said they were...

1067
01:00:56,599 --> 01:00:58,423
erotic yet deadly, like women.

1068
01:00:58,448 --> 01:00:59,548
I never said that.

1069
01:01:00,056 --> 01:01:01,557
Yes, you did.
No, I didn't.

1070
01:01:01,626 --> 01:01:02,744
I definitely heard you say it

1071
01:01:02,769 --> 01:01:04,232
because you were talking about
your ex-girlfriend who was...

1072
01:01:04,558 --> 01:01:05,672
sexy but a bitch.

1073
01:01:06,039 --> 01:01:07,874
Please don't eat on the tour.

1074
01:01:08,426 --> 01:01:09,573
Is that her?

1075
01:01:14,422 --> 01:01:16,762
Hey, I found a whole bunch
of boxes of clothes.

1076
01:01:16,924 --> 01:01:19,247
So sweetie, you can get some long pants,
nice loose-fitting ones,

1077
01:01:19,272 --> 01:01:20,501
and lose the short shorts, ok?

1078
01:01:20,525 --> 01:01:21,801
What Did you guys get?

1079
01:01:24,932 --> 01:01:26,048
It's protein.

1080
01:01:26,267 --> 01:01:28,017
Look, I said the essentials, ok?

1081
01:01:28,269 --> 01:01:30,396
It was not easy.
We almost got caught.

1082
01:01:30,772 --> 01:01:31,856
You stole mouthwash?

1083
01:01:32,103 --> 01:01:34,103
I like to be fresh when I am
making out with your daughter.

1084
01:01:35,275 --> 01:01:36,777
That's funny.

1085
01:01:40,615 --> 01:01:41,769
Yeah that's not happening,

1086
01:01:41,793 --> 01:01:42,724
ever.

1087
01:01:43,696 --> 01:01:44,661
Ever?

1088
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:48,013
This is our military prototype, Galvatron.

1089
01:01:49,261 --> 01:01:50,762
I don't understand it.

1090
01:01:51,167 --> 01:01:52,784
This is the fifth iteration.

1091
01:01:53,539 --> 01:01:55,112
Why does he keep turning out like this?

1092
01:01:55,797 --> 01:01:57,632
It's just some bugs in the final render.

1093
01:01:58,674 --> 01:02:01,640
I modeled Galvatron after Optimus Prime.

1094
01:02:01,928 --> 01:02:04,328
Why does he keep looking like Megatron?

1095
01:02:04,472 --> 01:02:06,974
<i>Rendering sequence
is almost finished. Stand by.</i>

1096
01:02:07,058 --> 01:02:08,684
Simple coding.

1097
01:02:11,104 --> 01:02:12,305
Algorithms!

1098
01:02:13,981 --> 01:02:15,024
Math!

1099
01:02:15,274 --> 01:02:16,637
Why can't we make,

1100
01:02:16,661 --> 01:02:18,383
what we want to make,

1101
01:02:18,653 --> 01:02:20,313
the way we want to make it?

1102
01:02:21,781 --> 01:02:22,766
Why?

1103
01:02:25,326 --> 01:02:28,271
And does that look like a
consumer-friendly face to you?

1104
01:02:29,997 --> 01:02:32,099
And what about that big hole in the chest?

1105
01:02:33,334 --> 01:02:35,178
I think it's bad-ass. I like it.

1106
01:02:35,458 --> 01:02:36,366
Love it.

1107
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:37,793
Well, I hate it.

1108
01:02:40,174 --> 01:02:41,634
Oh, here he is.

1109
01:02:41,884 --> 01:02:44,053
That bald-headed Doc Frankenstein.

1110
01:02:44,345 --> 01:02:46,403
Ma'am, this is not legal.

1111
01:02:46,427 --> 01:02:48,134
This is illegal experimentation.

1112
01:02:48,224 --> 01:02:50,017
Aliens would never do this to people!

1113
01:02:50,101 --> 01:02:51,782
Eat you, kill you maybe, but that's it.

1114
01:02:51,853 --> 01:02:53,962
This ain't right!
Nobody puts baby in a box!

1115
01:02:57,692 --> 01:02:59,105
This is worse than waterboarding!

1116
01:02:59,130 --> 01:03:01,090
This little gentleman
has been translating for us

1117
01:03:01,115 --> 01:03:03,614
all the information that comes
from these two heads.

1118
01:03:03,865 --> 01:03:06,492
Their history, their science, everything.

1119
01:03:06,576 --> 01:03:08,849
Is that Megatron?
Precisely.

1120
01:03:08,961 --> 01:03:10,630
Where did you get all this?

1121
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:12,582
Special government contract.

1122
01:03:12,874 --> 01:03:14,442
Now we know everything
about Transformers.

1123
01:03:14,709 --> 01:03:17,378
And now at long last we can
build them ourselves.

1124
01:03:17,563 --> 01:03:18,950
And we can build them better.

1125
01:03:41,027 --> 01:03:43,237
Yeah, that's good, Bee.
That will get us in.

1126
01:03:48,618 --> 01:03:50,206
<i>A couple times a day,
these guys are moving</i>

1127
01:03:50,231 --> 01:03:52,983
<i>in vehicle shipments into KSI
for something called scanning.</i>

1128
01:03:53,247 --> 01:03:54,665
<i>Major security all over.</i>

1129
01:03:54,749 --> 01:03:57,944
<i>So our best shot at getting in is a
back classified research entrance.</i>

1130
01:03:58,336 --> 01:04:00,178
<i>I am gonna drive in
with Bee tomorrow morning.</i>

1131
01:04:05,617 --> 01:04:08,265
Excuse me.
There is no smooching in front of me, ok?

1132
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:10,999
You are so square.
Who even says smooching?

1133
01:04:11,098 --> 01:04:12,515
I tell you, no respect.

1134
01:04:12,934 --> 01:04:14,499
It's just impossible sometimes.

1135
01:04:14,685 --> 01:04:15,548
Yeah.

1136
01:04:15,665 --> 01:04:17,698
I went through that with Bumblebee.

1137
01:04:25,738 --> 01:04:27,490
Calm down. Calm down.

1138
01:04:28,616 --> 01:04:30,730
You know, at a time like this,
the idea is to keep cool,

1139
01:04:30,754 --> 01:04:32,816
not look cool,
so why don't you lose the glasses?

1140
01:04:34,747 --> 01:04:36,043
About a month ago,

1141
01:04:36,666 --> 01:04:39,085
middle of the night,
I thought I heard noises in my house.

1142
01:04:39,168 --> 01:04:40,419
Was that you?

1143
01:04:40,573 --> 01:04:42,848
What? Come on. No way.
Don't lie to me, kid.

1144
01:04:43,314 --> 01:04:44,595
You see that guy with the gun out there?

1145
01:04:44,620 --> 01:04:45,821
There is so many guys with guns.

1146
01:04:45,846 --> 01:04:47,705
Let's get out of the car and tell him
we are about to break in

1147
01:04:47,729 --> 01:04:49,123
and it's your idea because I don't care.

1148
01:04:49,147 --> 01:04:50,681
I am old, I have already lived long enough.

1149
01:04:50,728 --> 01:04:51,722
You have a really bad habit

1150
01:04:51,747 --> 01:04:53,589
of having these conversations
at the wrong time, man.

1151
01:04:53,614 --> 01:04:55,543
You want to come clean
or you want me to make a mess?

1152
01:04:56,352 --> 01:04:57,662
Sir, can I talk to you for a second, please?

1153
01:04:57,687 --> 01:04:59,125
It was me, it was me,
it was me, it was me.

1154
01:05:00,523 --> 01:05:02,515
I am sorry. I am sorry.

1155
01:05:03,384 --> 01:05:04,851
Taking it in for scanning?

1156
01:05:08,781 --> 01:05:10,449
Alright. You are good to go.

1157
01:05:10,689 --> 01:05:12,065
I am literally gonna kill you.

1158

That is a bad-ass robot.

1165
01:05:31,887 --> 01:05:33,264
He kind of looks like you, Bee.

1166

<i>And now...</i>

1168
01:05:36,642 --> 01:05:37,919
They are trying to build their own versions.

1169
01:05:38,185 --> 01:05:40,387
Well, at least they are picking
cooler cars than this.

1170
01:05:43,732 --> 01:05:44,982
You talk to me like that?

1171
01:05:45,007 --> 01:05:46,123
Bee, stop!

1172
01:05:46,148 --> 01:05:47,849
You see what happens from being a wise-ass?

1173
01:05:48,644 --> 01:05:49,889
Now get out of here.

Bumblebee!
Bee, stop going psycho!

1180
01:06:04,822 --> 01:06:07,556
Our factory does not have enough
Transformium for production...

1181
01:06:07,581 --> 01:06:10,353
Because you don't keep
your promise to supply it.

1182
01:06:10,621 --> 01:06:11,849
My delicate flower,

1183
01:06:11,873 --> 01:06:13,501
I can't
understand you when you are angry.

1184
01:06:13,596 --> 01:06:15,869
Actually, I don't really understand you at all.

1185

Our entire factory is up and running...

Excuse me one second. Hey!

Hey, you two! Grease monkeys.

1188
01:06:23,314 --> 01:06:24,603
What the hell is going on here?

1189
01:06:25,149 --> 01:06:26,524
What's with this vintage crap?

1190
01:06:26,692 --> 01:06:28,611
We are not scanning collector car junk.

1191
01:06:29,070 --> 01:06:30,610
What do you think it is that we make here?

1192
01:06:31,595 --> 01:06:32,768
We make poetry.

1193
01:06:32,792 --> 01:06:34,033
We are poets.

1194
01:06:34,617 --> 01:06:35,980
Alright? You work for me,

1195
01:06:36,504 --> 01:06:38,079
you get one mistake. One.

1196
01:06:38,162 --> 01:06:39,763
Understood? It certainly won't.
It won't happen again.

1197
01:06:40,086 --> 01:06:42,576
So let's get this pathetic thing out of here.

1198
01:06:42,879 --> 01:06:43,958
And you too.

1199
01:06:44,335 --> 01:06:46,169
So sorry. So sorry.

I am going to see what I can find.

1202

Quietly get out of here.

1203
01:06:51,133 --> 01:06:53,343
I swear. I swear.
I can't bear it when you are angry.

1204
01:06:53,368 --> 01:06:54,911
You know how it upsets me.

1205
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:03,908
Bee, you got to calm down right now.

1206
01:07:03,933 --> 01:07:04,971
I am perfectly calm, dude.

1207
01:07:04,996 --> 01:07:07,274
You got to breathe, or just do
whatever it is that you do.

1208
01:07:07,299 --> 01:07:09,210
I am calm. I am calm.
I am not even touching it.

Turn back into a car right now!

1211
01:07:12,715 --> 01:07:13,753

01:07:27,597 --> 01:07:28,983
No! No!

This is dissection room seven.

Galvatron, render postmortem number 12.

Continued head disfigurement
at event number 32.

1229
01:08:02,872 --> 01:08:04,835
So what about the deal?
Is it done?

1230
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:06,041
Did you get the Seed?

1231
01:08:06,125 --> 01:08:08,046
We get it when the bounty hunter gets Prime.

1232
01:08:08,711 --> 01:08:10,906
Meanwhile, there has been a complication.

1233
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:12,093
A what?

1234
01:08:13,215 --> 01:08:15,134
No... No.

1235
01:08:15,217 --> 01:08:17,175
At KSI, we don't use words like that.

1236
01:08:17,845 --> 01:08:21,465
A civilian harboring the Autobots has
hacked into one of your mini-drones.

1237
01:08:21,974 --> 01:08:23,747
Meaning, they may know
of your involvement.

1238
01:08:25,304 --> 01:08:26,305
What?

1239
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:34,763
That was a little bit intense.

1240
01:08:35,446 --> 01:08:36,809
I need more Transformium,

1241
01:08:36,833 --> 01:08:38,018
and I need it now,

1242
01:08:38,042 --> 01:08:39,575
to build more prototypes.

1243
01:08:39,651 --> 01:08:42,130
You tell your alien bounty hunter

1244
01:08:42,369 --> 01:08:44,817
that I have staked my company...

1245
01:08:44,841 --> 01:08:46,440
on this deal.

1246
01:08:46,499 --> 01:08:48,250
And I have merely staked my life.

1247
01:08:48,482 --> 01:08:50,971
Hey, you came to me on this, remember?

1248
01:08:51,086 --> 01:08:52,797
You retire from the CIA,

1249
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,910
you get a seven figure piece
of my company,

1250
01:08:55,137 --> 01:08:56,829
and you and I, revolutionize

1251
01:08:56,853 --> 01:08:58,914
national defense, together.

1252
01:08:59,345 --> 01:09:00,458
But Attinger...

1253
01:09:01,016 --> 01:09:02,001
buddy,

1254
01:09:02,657 --> 01:09:04,064
for both our sakes,

1255
01:09:04,683 --> 01:09:07,146
you need to deliver

1256
01:09:07,478 --> 01:09:08,810
the Seed.

1257
01:09:25,978 --> 01:09:28,142
<i>I am in. Can you see my camera?</i>

1258
01:09:29,234 --> 01:09:30,775
<i>They are melting Ratchet.</i>

1259
01:09:31,836 --> 01:09:33,939
They slaughtered Ratchet!

1260
01:09:34,421 --> 01:09:36,573
I am gonna tear them apart!

1261
01:09:37,883 --> 01:09:38,815
Metal.

1262
01:09:40,135 --> 01:09:41,123
Just metal.

1263
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:42,784
That's what I always thought of them.

1264
01:09:43,389 --> 01:09:44,390
Well they are not.

1265
01:09:44,415 --> 01:09:45,377
They are living things,

1266
01:09:45,784 --> 01:09:46,961
with souls like ours.

1267
01:09:48,561 --> 01:09:50,381
I mean once, I spoke to one.

1268
01:09:50,980 --> 01:09:52,795
And you are working with Transformium?

1269
01:09:53,232 --> 01:09:55,818
Yeah, that's what I do.
I am.

1270
01:09:56,151 --> 01:09:59,014
I am out there digging for it.
There is just not much left to find.

1271
01:09:59,822 --> 01:10:01,920
So that's how badly you boys need more?

1272
01:10:02,298 --> 01:10:04,634
Reduced to melting evil old Decepticons down.

1273
01:10:05,619 --> 01:10:06,482
No.

1274
01:10:06,826 --> 01:10:08,392
That's an Autobot there.

1275
01:10:09,373 --> 01:10:10,697
The ones who fought for us.

1276
01:10:10,754 --> 01:10:12,705
I have got this taken care of from here.
Right.

1277
01:10:13,602 --> 01:10:15,604
Same badge code scanned
at two separate gates.

1278
01:10:15,629 --> 01:10:17,658
I am having the classified
area locked down now.

1279
01:10:25,806 --> 01:10:27,093
Check that guy.

1280
01:10:29,059 --> 01:10:29,887
Hey!

1281
01:10:31,145 --> 01:10:32,354
Stop right there!

1282
01:10:36,692 --> 01:10:37,693
Stop!

1283
01:10:43,565 --> 01:10:44,380
Freeze!

1284
01:10:46,955 --> 01:10:48,216
Up against the wall.

1285
01:10:48,996 --> 01:10:50,010
Alright.

1286
01:10:51,665 --> 01:10:53,195
Corporate espionage.

1287
01:10:53,219 --> 01:10:55,838
That's a very serious crime, Mr. Yeager.

1288
01:11:19,026 --> 01:11:20,736
Look, I want a lawyer.

1289
01:11:20,819 --> 01:11:22,834
The Justice Department.
Somebody I can trust.

1290
01:11:22,859 --> 01:11:25,144
I am just trying to protect my family, ok?
Not from your company,

1291
01:11:25,168 --> 01:11:26,248
from the government.

1292
01:11:26,367 --> 01:11:27,482
Mr. Yeager,

1293
01:11:27,952 --> 01:11:29,495
who do you think I work for?

1294
01:11:30,037 --> 01:11:31,442
You are trying to protect your family,

1295
01:11:31,948 --> 01:11:33,098
that's admirable.

1296
01:11:33,123 --> 01:11:35,154
I am trying to defend the nation,

1297
01:11:35,178 --> 01:11:37,252
from alien war. We have had
a taste of what that looks like,

1298
01:11:37,277 --> 01:11:39,033
and we are not gonna tolerate another.

1299
01:11:39,361 --> 01:11:40,214
Now...

1300
01:11:40,464 --> 01:11:42,536
There is a version of this conversation,

1301
01:11:43,141 --> 01:11:44,635
where you get to go back to your barn,

1302
01:11:44,969 --> 01:11:46,637
your daughter gets to graduate with honors,

1303
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:47,875
and life as you know it,

1304
01:11:48,266 --> 01:11:49,375
will go on.

1305
01:11:50,724 --> 01:11:53,287
You have no idea what
you are involved with here.

1306
01:11:55,062 --> 01:11:56,248
Really?

1307
01:11:57,521 --> 01:11:59,483
What's the other version of this conversation?

1308
01:11:59,733 --> 01:12:02,248
The one when you send in the hired
help to murder my little girl?

1309
01:12:03,234 --> 01:12:05,105
Or you gonna man up and do it yourself?

1310
01:12:08,075 --> 01:12:09,743
What's your preference?

1311
01:12:10,678 --> 01:12:12,180
I am going to ask you this once.

1312
01:12:12,913 --> 01:12:14,485
Where is Optimus Prime?

1313
01:12:49,324 --> 01:12:50,743
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

1314
01:12:50,857 --> 01:12:51,939
We are moving.

1315
01:12:52,212 --> 01:12:53,275
Basement.

1316
01:12:56,279 --> 01:12:57,280
They are here.

1317
01:13:00,294 --> 01:13:01,962
Get out! All of you!

1318
01:13:02,046 --> 01:13:03,380
Science fair is over, meat-bags!

1319
01:13:03,464 --> 01:13:05,315
Destroy the lab!
Move, move, move, move!

1320
01:13:05,448 --> 01:13:07,217
Look out! Look out!

1321
01:13:08,002 --> 01:13:09,784
Destroy it all!

1322
01:13:12,264 --> 01:13:14,365
Danger! Security breach!
Danger! Secu...

1323
01:13:16,326 --> 01:13:17,494
Guys! It's me!

1324
01:13:17,519 --> 01:13:19,313
Break me out of this Frankenstein box!

1325
01:13:19,435 --> 01:13:20,349
Hey!

1326
01:13:20,991 --> 01:13:21,774
Hey!

1327
01:13:23,609 --> 01:13:24,304
Hey!

1328
01:13:24,773 --> 01:13:25,640
Stop!

1329
01:13:26,111 --> 01:13:27,696
That's company property!

1330
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:30,157
They are not your property!

1331
01:13:32,785 --> 01:13:35,468
They were my friends.

1332
01:13:37,873 --> 01:13:41,376
Oh, you ain't talking so much now!
You got Hound in front of you?

1333
01:13:41,710 --> 01:13:42,711
Go ahead.

1334
01:13:43,170 --> 01:13:45,022
Show us your true colors, once and for all.

1335
01:13:45,047 --> 01:13:46,827
Just give me the word,

1336
01:13:46,851 --> 01:13:48,342
I will splatter him.

1337
01:13:49,051 --> 01:13:50,750
Why don't you tell Itchy Fingers here,

1338
01:13:50,832 --> 01:13:52,988
that this is all the spoils of war.

1339
01:13:53,458 --> 01:13:54,621
Dead metal.

1340
01:13:55,808 --> 01:13:56,795
Innovation.

1341
01:13:56,819 --> 01:13:58,977
What we do here is science.

1342
01:13:59,311 --> 01:14:01,913
Because if we don't do it, somebody else will.

1343
01:14:02,589 --> 01:14:04,866
Because you cannot stop technology!

1344
01:14:04,983 --> 01:14:07,820
We are not your technology!

1345
01:14:12,762 --> 01:14:14,885
Let me vaporize his ass.

1346
01:14:14,910 --> 01:14:16,482
I broke the code.

1347
01:14:17,083 --> 01:14:19,378
I own your whole genome.

1348
01:14:20,207 --> 01:14:22,876
The world will know
what you are doing here.

1349
01:14:23,196 --> 01:14:24,211
The world?

1350
01:14:24,453 --> 01:14:26,168
The world will approve.

1351
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:28,559
We can make you now.

1352
01:14:29,002 --> 01:14:30,244
Don't you get it?

1353
01:14:31,051 --> 01:14:33,356
We don't need you anymore.

1354
01:14:34,555 --> 01:14:36,119
That was cruel.

1355
01:14:41,728 --> 01:14:42,994
Autobots,

1356
01:14:44,231 --> 01:14:45,780
we are done.

1357
01:14:46,483 --> 01:14:48,875
We are done?
We are not gonna kick a little bit of ass?

1358
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:50,943
I have been itching to kill something lately.

1359
01:14:50,988 --> 01:14:52,706
This is our chance.
We have to stop him.

1360
01:14:52,731 --> 01:14:53,858
You have to stop him.

1361
01:14:53,949 --> 01:14:55,325
It's never been tested in the field.

1362
01:14:55,350 --> 01:14:57,719
Labs, military bases,
but not on civilian streets.

1363
01:14:57,744 --> 01:15:01,275
Down there a Defense Department contract
was just attacked in a terrorist attack.

1364
01:15:01,415 --> 01:15:03,954
This is now a CIA military op.

1365
01:15:04,209 --> 01:15:05,697
You are indemnified.

1366
01:15:05,915 --> 01:15:07,035
Respond!

1367
01:15:12,530 --> 01:15:13,697
Let's go.

1368
01:15:14,845 --> 01:15:17,181
KSI Chicago, closest live sat, patch it in.

1369
01:15:17,264 --> 01:15:18,724
Been an unprovoked Autobot attack.

1370
01:15:18,749 --> 01:15:20,258
Bring up Galvatron.

1371
01:15:23,770 --> 01:15:25,055
Transforming Galvatron.

1372
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:27,332
<i>Galvatron coming online.</i>

1373
01:15:30,110 --> 01:15:31,365
Bring up Stinger.

1374
01:15:32,446 --> 01:15:34,448
<i>Stinger coming online.</i>

1375
01:15:40,307 --> 01:15:42,192
Let's show these alien terrorists,

1376
01:15:42,513 --> 01:15:44,066
what an upgrade looks like.

1377
01:15:45,438 --> 01:15:47,900
<i>Galvatron and Stinger are moving
to intercept targets.</i>

1378
01:15:53,842 --> 01:15:56,261
Reapers. Five targets in the open.
Good picture.

1379
01:16:01,433 --> 01:16:02,601
Two miles to intercept.

1380
01:16:14,196 --> 01:16:15,197
200 meters.

1381
01:16:16,031 --> 01:16:16,985
Engage.

1382
01:16:17,824 --> 01:16:18,813
Transform.

1383
01:16:44,059 --> 01:16:45,769
We are programming this, right?

1384
01:16:45,852 --> 01:16:46,465
Yes.

1385
01:16:47,236 --> 01:16:48,009
Mostly.

1386
01:16:48,034 --> 01:16:49,759
<i>Systems seem to have malfunctioned.</i>

1387
01:16:50,649 --> 01:16:52,158
Targeting five bogeys.

1388
01:16:53,193 --> 01:16:54,314
Engaging rockets.

1389
01:16:55,059 --> 01:16:56,060
Missiles away.

1390
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:12,616
Gotta haul ass, Bee! Come on!

1391
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:17,478
Stinger is in pursuit.

1392
01:17:28,895 --> 01:17:30,610
Misfire, misfire!
Misfire, misfire!

1393
01:17:30,635 --> 01:17:32,885
System failure.
Galvatron just fired four rockets.

1394
01:17:32,910 --> 01:17:34,417
They are shooting at us!

1395
01:17:44,543 --> 01:17:46,363
Watch out! What are you doing?

1396
01:18:23,492 --> 01:18:24,593
What was that?

1397
01:18:25,969 --> 01:18:28,644
We need a full medical team now.
Possible civilian casualties.

1398
01:18:28,669 --> 01:18:30,668
I mean, you got a lot of people in
the crossfire here. I don't like...

1399
01:18:30,722 --> 01:18:33,176
You are making history here.
For your country, for the world.

1400
01:18:33,293 --> 01:18:35,337
Human freedom is at stake.

1401
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:37,488
Innocent people die, all the time.

1402
01:18:44,596 --> 01:18:45,799
Come on, Optimus!

1403
01:19:11,498 --> 01:19:12,516
Tessa!

1404
01:19:22,259 --> 01:19:24,075
Make him fight. Don't let him go down.

1405
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:25,101
Make him fight!

1406
01:19:25,476 --> 01:19:27,107
Come on, come on.
Come on, come on.

1407
01:19:33,730 --> 01:19:34,815
Tessa!

1408
01:19:35,566 --> 01:19:36,567
Tessa!

1409
01:19:37,190 --> 01:19:38,358
Tessa, run to the field!

1410
01:19:45,449 --> 01:19:47,405
You have no soul!

1411
01:19:48,285 --> 01:19:51,288
That is why I have no fear!

1412
01:19:52,372 --> 01:19:53,623
You die!

1413
01:20:06,386 --> 01:20:07,554
Help me!

1414
01:20:30,744 --> 01:20:31,995
What is that?

1415
01:20:33,038 --> 01:20:34,317
That's my asset.

1416
01:20:35,133 --> 01:20:36,291
Pull Galvatron back.

1417
01:20:36,583 --> 01:20:37,539
Do it.

1418
01:21:09,347 --> 01:21:10,348
I got to go get her.

1419
01:21:13,786 --> 01:21:14,738
Tessa!

1420
01:21:16,253 --> 01:21:17,863
Don't go out there!
He will kill you!

1421
01:21:17,941 --> 01:21:19,776
She needs my help!
She is hidden!

1422
01:21:20,126 --> 01:21:22,121
Optimus! Optimus, get up, get up!

1423
01:21:22,153 --> 01:21:23,415
I can't.

1424
01:21:23,439 --> 01:21:25,082
Get out of here.

1425
01:21:27,884 --> 01:21:29,915
I feel sorry for you, Prime.

1426
01:21:30,247 --> 01:21:32,314
Your allegiance to these humans.

1427
01:21:32,889 --> 01:21:35,170
The trouble with loyalty to a cause,

1428
01:21:35,311 --> 01:21:36,755
is that the cause...

1429
01:21:37,357 --> 01:21:39,607
will always betray you.

1430
01:21:40,146 --> 01:21:42,202
Who sent you here?

1431
01:21:42,570 --> 01:21:44,739
Where do you think you came from?

1432
01:21:45,119 --> 01:21:46,871
You think you were born?

1433
01:21:47,758 --> 01:21:48,683
No.

1434
01:21:49,058 --> 01:21:50,524
You were built.

1435
01:21:51,087 --> 01:21:53,711
And your creators want you back.

1436
01:21:54,327 --> 01:21:56,602
We all work for someone.

1437
01:22:07,674 --> 01:22:08,799
No, no.

1438
01:22:09,843 --> 01:22:10,844
No.

1439
01:22:11,346 --> 01:22:12,347
It's got her!

1440
01:22:12,418 --> 01:22:13,853
She is in the car!
Tessa!

1441
01:22:13,972 --> 01:22:15,682
No!
Tessa!

1442
01:22:21,062 --> 01:22:22,397
Dad!

1443
01:22:22,731 --> 01:22:24,549
Tessa, get out!

1444
01:22:25,191 --> 01:22:26,401
Get out!

1445
01:22:27,861 --> 01:22:28,945
Tessa!

1446
01:22:33,074 --> 01:22:34,539
Get out! Tessa!

1447
01:22:34,564 --> 01:22:35,935
Dad, help me!
Tessa!

1448
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:37,607
Please help me, help me! Dad!

1449
01:22:38,005 --> 01:22:38,897
Dad!

1450
01:22:43,043 --> 01:22:43,975
Dad!

1451
01:22:44,753 --> 01:22:46,338
Dad!
Tessa! Break the glass!

1452
01:22:46,421 --> 01:22:48,590
Break the glass to get out!
I am trying!

1453
01:22:49,215 --> 01:22:50,925
Tessa, I can't hold on!
Dad!

1454
01:22:51,139 --> 01:22:52,035
Tessa!

1455
01:22:52,594 --> 01:22:54,449
Help me!
Just break it! Break the glass!

1456
01:22:54,474 --> 01:22:55,475
Tess...

1457
01:22:59,601 --> 01:23:01,936
Cade, warn the Autobots!

1458
01:23:02,020 --> 01:23:04,731
Dad, help me! Don't leave me!

1459
01:23:05,565 --> 01:23:07,734
No!

1460
01:23:36,288 --> 01:23:38,482
Take that human to the trash.

1461
01:23:50,068 --> 01:23:51,611
Mr. Secretary.

1462
01:23:52,737 --> 01:23:56,253
My team is on the way.
This is a CIA operation.

1463
01:23:56,408 --> 01:23:58,495
This is my asset.

1464
01:23:59,035 --> 01:24:01,175
Tell the military to stand down.

1465
01:24:01,746 --> 01:24:03,172
Hang on, I have the White House.

1466
01:24:03,331 --> 01:24:05,281
<i>Agent, hello!
Oh, my goodness.</i>

1467
01:24:05,306 --> 01:24:07,875
Boy, is it a flurry of excitement
over here at the White House.

1468
01:24:08,044 --> 01:24:10,380
Everybody is super, super mad.
At me.

1469
01:24:10,463 --> 01:24:12,446
So, I went over my notes
from our last meeting,

1470
01:24:12,471 --> 01:24:15,181
and I am not sure when
you said anything about

1471
01:24:15,301 --> 01:24:17,205
a giant alien warship over Michigan Avenue.

1472
01:24:17,303 --> 01:24:19,472
Tell the President this is not an attack.

1473
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:29,232
Remember this ship, Prime?

1474
01:24:29,315 --> 01:24:32,068
Built for all you Knights,
you great crusaders,

1475
01:24:32,097 --> 01:24:34,167
to explore the universe.

1476
01:24:34,404 --> 01:24:38,550
Well, I commandeered it.
It's my personal prison now.

1477
01:25:34,255 --> 01:25:35,223
Optimus?

1478
01:25:43,097 --> 01:25:46,130
Welcome back
to the Knights' Temenos, Prime.

1479
01:25:47,849 --> 01:25:50,388
You have disgraced it.

1480
01:25:56,069 --> 01:25:59,917
Join your fellow rebels, fugitive scum.

1481
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:03,868
It's for the rarest of specimens.
The worst of the worst.

1482
01:26:03,952 --> 01:26:05,853
It's taken centuries,

1483
01:26:05,995 --> 01:26:08,109
but I have collected all the Knights...

1484
01:26:08,484 --> 01:26:09,751
but you.

1485
01:26:17,253 --> 01:26:20,334
The creators want to sweep
their chessboard clean.

1486
01:26:23,847 --> 01:26:25,752
I am slave...

1487
01:26:26,182 --> 01:26:27,714
to no one.

1488
01:26:28,977 --> 01:26:32,121
All this species mixing with species.

1489
01:26:33,189 --> 01:26:35,358
It upsets the cosmic balance.

1490
01:26:35,567 --> 01:26:37,735
The creators, they don't like it.

1491
01:26:38,152 --> 01:26:41,590
They built you to do what you were told.

1492
01:26:44,492 --> 01:26:45,917
Why hasn't it taken off yet?

1493
01:26:45,952 --> 01:26:47,897
Come on, Bee, it's descending.
You got to get on it!

1494
01:26:48,443 --> 01:26:50,111
<i>Savoy, mission accomplished.</i>

1495
01:26:50,136 --> 01:26:51,319
<i>Lockdown has Prime.</i>

1496
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:53,229
<i>The deal is going down now.</i>

1497
01:26:53,459 --> 01:26:55,147
Picking up the Seed at the recon point.

1498
01:27:09,434 --> 01:27:11,176
<i>Nest, Talon.
L.Z. appears clear.</i>

1499
01:27:33,207 --> 01:27:34,893
Much as I have enjoyed the hunt,

1500
01:27:35,162 --> 01:27:37,548
I won't miss your wretched planet.

1501
01:27:37,949 --> 01:27:38,992
Our deal is done.

1502
01:27:39,242 --> 01:27:41,386
One Prime for one Seed.

1503
01:27:43,652 --> 01:27:45,362
Handle it with care.

1504
01:27:48,514 --> 01:27:51,273
I trust your species is ready.

1505
01:27:51,851 --> 01:27:53,645
Don't worry about our species.

1506
01:27:54,340 --> 01:27:56,426
Farewell, Earth.

1507
01:28:06,699 --> 01:28:07,669
Come on, come on!

1508
01:28:20,348 --> 01:28:21,349
Bee, come on!

1509
01:28:22,757 --> 01:28:24,329
It's a bad idea.

1510
01:28:24,493 --> 01:28:27,026
But I am all about bad ideas.

1511
01:28:27,535 --> 01:28:28,563
Let's go!

1512
01:28:29,931 --> 01:28:31,876
Well, let's rock.

1513
01:28:51,914 --> 01:28:53,082
This is crazy.

1514
01:28:53,204 --> 01:28:54,706
Look, you wanna cut and run,
you better do it now.

1515
01:28:54,789 --> 01:28:56,124
I am gonna die trying.

1516
01:28:56,666 --> 01:28:58,679
Hey, I am not here to help
you get your daughter.

1517
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:00,503
You are here to help me get my girlfriend.

1518
01:29:02,755 --> 01:29:04,869
Engage dark-matter drives.

1519
01:29:05,354 --> 01:29:06,640
Full power.

1520
01:29:16,769 --> 01:29:18,354
We are behind enemy lines now.

1521
01:29:18,438 --> 01:29:20,385
Lockdown's ship has booby traps.

1522
01:29:20,409 --> 01:29:21,591
Eyes open.

1523
01:29:21,774 --> 01:29:24,769
Beware of his bone grinders,
brain blinders, flesh peelers,

1524
01:29:24,794 --> 01:29:27,016
chromosomal inverters, catatonic sludge,

1525
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:29,158
black hole trapdoors,
and of course radiation.

1526
01:29:29,407 --> 01:29:30,603
We must be quick.

1527
01:29:30,627 --> 01:29:32,368
We have the element of surprise.

1528
01:29:32,452 --> 01:29:35,163
Let's try to use violence as a last resort.

1529
01:29:36,914 --> 01:29:37,957
Oh, get it!

1530
01:29:38,082 --> 01:29:39,208
I kill you! Kill you!

1531
01:29:39,542 --> 01:29:40,877
I Hate those things.

1532
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:43,337
That's freaky.
He is not alive anymore.

1533
01:29:43,421 --> 01:29:45,840
Well, we looked. They are not here.
Let's go.

1534
01:29:46,090 --> 01:29:48,392
What? Hey, I am not going
anywhere without Tessa.

1535
01:29:48,718 --> 01:29:49,956
I am unclear.

1536
01:29:50,112 --> 01:29:51,359
What's in it for me?

1537
01:29:51,384 --> 01:29:52,733
What's in it for you?

1538
01:29:53,973 --> 01:29:56,309
Easy. Let's use words.

1539
01:29:56,642 --> 01:29:59,562
What's in it for you is I don't kill you.

1540
01:29:59,645 --> 01:30:01,008
We are getting the boss back.

1541
01:30:01,032 --> 01:30:03,107
And the girl. Copy?

1542
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:06,639
Ok, ok. Very persuasive.

1543
01:30:06,663 --> 01:30:08,192
Textbook machismo.

1544
01:30:08,279 --> 01:30:09,225
Well, then.

1545
01:30:09,249 --> 01:30:11,161
We will need to sabotage something.

1546
01:30:11,324 --> 01:30:14,911
Better hurry. Because dark-matter
drives are preparing to take off.

1547
01:30:14,936 --> 01:30:17,394
Oh, wonderful.
I give us 10 minutes.

1548
01:30:17,419 --> 01:30:19,574
Is that what that sound is?
The engines filling up?

1549
01:30:19,665 --> 01:30:21,350
Are you telling me that thing is gonna be...

1550
01:30:21,375 --> 01:30:23,186
This is gonna be flying out
of here in 10 minutes?

1551
01:30:23,211 --> 01:30:24,353
Ten minutes?

1552
01:30:24,378 --> 01:30:25,753
Could be nine.
Worst case, seven.

1553
01:30:25,778 --> 01:30:28,193
Humans, search the cell blocks.
We are wasting time, let's go.

1554
01:30:28,218 --> 01:30:30,568
We will find the center core.
Let's move.

1555
01:30:30,593 --> 01:30:32,538
We are gonna stop this nightmare ship.

1556
01:30:47,777 --> 01:30:49,654
We are never gonna
find her in this huge ship.

1557
01:30:49,679 --> 01:30:51,284
Like a needle in a haystack.

1558
01:30:52,615 --> 01:30:53,831
Tessa!

1559
01:30:55,159 --> 01:30:56,494
Great. Great.

1560
01:30:59,455 --> 01:31:00,665
Oh, that was smooth.

1561
01:31:00,748 --> 01:31:03,141
No, that was really smooth,
letting everybody know we are here.

1562
01:31:03,543 --> 01:31:04,867
Now they are gonna be looking for us.

1563
01:31:13,219 --> 01:31:14,957
Better hurry, Crosshairs,

1564
01:31:15,289 --> 01:31:17,125
before we go into space!

1565
01:31:17,425 --> 01:31:19,914
Here is the little jujube right here.

1566
01:31:21,727 --> 01:31:23,719
Hello, Mama.

1567
01:31:35,575 --> 01:31:37,646
Who fired the anchors?

1568
01:31:41,789 --> 01:31:44,796
Who is on my ship?
We have a loose prisoner.

1569
01:31:48,884 --> 01:31:49,825
Hurry up.

1570
01:31:50,486 --> 01:31:52,392
We got like six minutes.
We will find her.

1571
01:31:54,492 --> 01:31:55,431
Hold up.

1572
01:31:59,082 --> 01:31:59,971
Back up.

1573
01:32:02,976 --> 01:32:05,210
Come on, these things are gonna find us.
Hurry, hide.

1574
01:33:01,661 --> 01:33:02,662
Weapons!

1575
01:33:03,226 --> 01:33:05,163
Come here. Help me.
Hurry, hurry.

1576
01:33:11,550 --> 01:33:12,613
Help me up.

1577
01:33:13,584 --> 01:33:15,222
There are some weird sounds out there.

1578
01:33:59,552 --> 01:34:01,465
What is that?
I don't know.

1579
01:34:02,286 --> 01:34:03,233
You ready?

1580
01:34:03,931 --> 01:34:04,932
Run.

1581
01:34:14,233 --> 01:34:15,779
Alright, we are not going down
without a fight.

1582
01:34:18,738 --> 01:34:20,406
They turn that corner
and we are gonna take them.

1583
01:34:20,489 --> 01:34:22,721
You ready or you gonna bitch out on me?
No, I got your back.

1584
01:34:22,746 --> 01:34:24,144
Are you ready?
Absolutely.

1585
01:34:26,912 --> 01:34:28,234
Don't bitch out on me.
Are you ready?

1586
01:34:28,259 --> 01:34:29,638
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1587
01:34:30,172 --> 01:34:31,320
Ok! I surrender!

1588
01:34:31,344 --> 01:34:33,079
I surrender!
I surrender!

1589
01:34:38,466 --> 01:34:40,536
I am so sorry! I am so, so, so sorry!

1590
01:34:40,593 --> 01:34:41,850
What did you do?
How did you do that?

1591
01:34:41,875 --> 01:34:43,106
I have no idea!

1592
01:34:43,179 --> 01:34:45,528
You no-good, chickenshit little rat!

1593
01:34:46,640 --> 01:34:48,309
Look at that. You see that?

1594
01:34:50,644 --> 01:34:52,184
You stay here, Lucky Charms!

1595
01:35:10,623 --> 01:35:11,736
Oh, man.

1596
01:35:12,174 --> 01:35:13,912
I am so gonna patent this shit.

1597
01:35:28,475 --> 01:35:29,350
Tess!

1598
01:35:30,142 --> 01:35:32,296
Dad! Help me!

1599
01:35:32,937 --> 01:35:34,074
Hey!
Dad!

1600
01:35:34,099 --> 01:35:35,608
Tess?
Tess!

1601
01:35:41,112 --> 01:35:42,321
Come on, move, move!

1602
01:35:43,572 --> 01:35:44,615
Tessa!

1603
01:35:44,740 --> 01:35:47,418
Shane, I love you! I love you!
You saved me! You saved me!

1604
01:35:47,443 --> 01:35:48,918
I know. I know.

1605
01:35:50,162 --> 01:35:52,427
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1606
01:35:52,623 --> 01:35:55,232
Thank you. You saved me.
Oh yeah, he saved you. Yeah.

1607
01:35:55,779 --> 01:35:56,576
Yeah.

1608
01:35:57,227 --> 01:35:59,647
I think you and Mr. I Surrender have
a lot to catch up about, sweetie.

1609
01:35:59,672 --> 01:36:01,869
He saved me, too. You should
have seen him in there. I mean...

1610
01:36:01,893 --> 01:36:04,218
our hero. Let's go. Now.

1611
01:36:04,885 --> 01:36:06,781
Eyes open.
I almost got it.

1612
01:36:07,763 --> 01:36:10,099
Big boy coming through!
Move, move, move.

1613
01:36:11,725 --> 01:36:13,547
This has got to be the Supermax.

1614
01:36:13,719 --> 01:36:15,321
Watch the corners.

1615
01:36:15,855 --> 01:36:17,523
There is a lot of cages.

1616
01:36:17,648 --> 01:36:19,692
Oh, yeah. Creepy critters in here.

1617
01:36:19,900 --> 01:36:22,194
I don't want to know what's in the big cage.

1618
01:36:22,528 --> 01:36:25,148
What's this?
Hound, don't do it.

1619
01:36:25,173 --> 01:36:27,551
You don't look very dangerous in there.

1620
01:36:28,451 --> 01:36:29,688
Oh, that's...

1621
01:36:30,211 --> 01:36:32,161
that's festering ugliness.

1622
01:36:32,455 --> 01:36:35,119
I am hit! I am down! It's melting!

1623
01:36:35,301 --> 01:36:36,302
It burns!

1624
01:36:37,126 --> 01:36:38,720
I think it's acid!

1625
01:36:39,384 --> 01:36:42,179
Nuts. It's just shizzle.

1626
01:36:43,174 --> 01:36:45,145
I hope that's not contagious.

1627
01:36:45,170 --> 01:36:46,622
I got to hurt you now.

1628
01:36:46,646 --> 01:36:48,445
You are just too disturbing to live.

1629
01:36:48,804 --> 01:36:50,445
Take that, bitch!

1630
01:36:52,596 --> 01:36:54,129
You are dead.
Hound!

1631
01:36:54,324 --> 01:36:55,821
He is alive!

1632
01:36:55,846 --> 01:36:56,977
Hold on boss, we are coming!

1633
01:36:57,002 --> 01:36:59,123
Optimus sound off!
In here, quick!

1634
01:36:59,148 --> 01:37:00,599
Hang on, we are coming for you!

1635
01:37:00,624 --> 01:37:02,376
The arms of this Knight Ship detach!

1636
01:37:02,401 --> 01:37:05,362
We can break free!
It's a separate ship! Hurry!

1637
01:37:05,446 --> 01:37:06,939
Where is the cockpit?
Right or left?

1638
01:37:06,964 --> 01:37:08,257
Right!
I am on it boss.

1639
01:37:08,282 --> 01:37:10,806
Hurry. We have no time.

1640
01:37:10,831 --> 01:37:11,761
Sensei.

1641
01:37:11,786 --> 01:37:12,813
Let's rock!

1642
01:37:13,325 --> 01:37:15,290
I always wanted to fly one of these things.

1643
01:37:15,315 --> 01:37:16,650
I am there, boss!

1644
01:37:19,001 --> 01:37:21,204
Hey, Yeager Technologies,

1645
01:37:21,712 --> 01:37:23,964
you gonna invent us a way out of this one?

1646
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,187
Oh, my God.

1647
01:37:34,558 --> 01:37:35,935
I am not doing this.

1648
01:37:36,310 --> 01:37:38,103
I am not doing that.
Yes we are.

1649
01:37:39,188 --> 01:37:41,232
No, it's good. It's stable.
Come on.

1650
01:37:41,649 --> 01:37:42,942
No way.
Sweetie...

1651
01:37:43,039 --> 01:37:43,929
you know why I am here?

1652
01:37:43,953 --> 01:37:44,953
I am here to protect you.
You...

1653
01:37:44,978 --> 01:37:45,979
have done great at that.

1654
01:37:46,004 --> 01:37:48,289
I want you to trust me right now.
We are getting down. Let's go.

1655
01:37:53,017 --> 01:37:54,343
Don't look down, ok?

1656
01:37:54,538 --> 01:37:56,191
Step.
See, it's easy.

1657
01:37:56,370 --> 01:37:57,480
Come on.

1658
01:38:00,459 --> 01:38:02,795
Careful, these cables are
starting to get thinner here!

1659
01:38:03,128 --> 01:38:05,714
Step. Step. There.
Oh, my God!

1660
01:38:05,798 --> 01:38:08,425
See, don't look down! Alright?
Don't look down.

1661
01:38:08,634 --> 01:38:10,803
We are gonna be at the building in no time!

1662
01:38:12,054 --> 01:38:13,264
You ok, Tess?

1663
01:38:14,181 --> 01:38:15,266
Keep stepping.

1664
01:38:15,726 --> 01:38:17,895
Oh my God!
Oh my God, Dad!

1665
01:38:22,493 --> 01:38:24,861
Alright sweetie.
You need to keep moving here, ok?

1666
01:38:25,859 --> 01:38:27,111
Come on!
I can't.

1667
01:38:27,528 --> 01:38:28,832
I am freaking out.

1668
01:38:29,386 --> 01:38:30,551
You need to move now!

1669
01:38:30,864 --> 01:38:32,227
I am not moving!

1670
01:38:32,251 --> 01:38:33,826
I am going back to the ship!

1671
01:38:36,829 --> 01:38:37,583
Oh, shit!

1672
01:38:38,539 --> 01:38:40,989
You can't go back to the ship, honey!
Watch me!

1673
01:38:41,014 --> 01:38:43,610
You are not 18 years old yet
and you are gonna do what I say!

1674
01:38:43,635 --> 01:38:44,888
Now let's go!

1675
01:38:51,218 --> 01:38:53,248
We need to go this way, ok.

1676
01:38:53,272 --> 01:38:54,388
Not that way.

1677
01:38:54,638 --> 01:38:56,026
Talk to her Romeo! Now!

1678
01:38:56,181 --> 01:38:57,330
Come on, for God's sake.

1679
01:38:57,558 --> 01:38:59,104
Do not start with me.

1680
01:39:03,897 --> 01:39:05,357
Oh my God, what is that?

1681
01:39:05,649 --> 01:39:06,650
Alright Tessa.

1682
01:39:07,192 --> 01:39:08,402
Don't look back.

1683
01:39:08,527 --> 01:39:10,795
Well don't say that to me.
Now I want to turn around.

1684
01:39:10,820 --> 01:39:12,506
It's nothing major, sweetie.

1685
01:39:12,531 --> 01:39:14,163
Well, that means it's totally major!

1686
01:39:14,188 --> 01:39:15,723
I am gonna have to point
this gun in your direction.

1687
01:39:15,748 --> 01:39:17,929
It's gonna feel like it's in your direction,
but I am not.

1688
01:39:19,788 --> 01:39:21,765
You better hurry.
Are you trying to kill me?

1689
01:39:21,790 --> 01:39:23,684
I had to bust my ass to get
up here on this spaceship!

1690
01:39:23,709 --> 01:39:25,210
Shoot it!
Get down now!

1691
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:48,025
Tessa, wait! I am coming for you!
Tessa! Oh!

1692
01:39:58,327 --> 01:39:59,996
Oh, my God!
I am coming!

1693
01:40:00,829 --> 01:40:01,926
Hold on!

1694
01:40:25,521 --> 01:40:27,660
You are the best, Bee!
You are the best.

1695
01:40:27,685 --> 01:40:29,917
You damn right!
And don't ever forget it.

1696
01:40:29,942 --> 01:40:32,333
You see that? Look at me!
We are off the ship, right?

1697
01:40:32,611 --> 01:40:34,863
Bumblebee!
Bumblebee! Friendly!

1698
01:40:35,197 --> 01:40:37,227
Enemy ships are coming in hot.

1699
01:40:37,368 --> 01:40:38,984
Get on! Get on!

1700
01:40:49,002 --> 01:40:51,004
Hold your knickers, I am punching it!

1701
01:41:02,182 --> 01:41:03,496
They got three ships on them!

1702
01:41:03,521 --> 01:41:04,838
I am giving it the juice!

1703
01:41:08,991 --> 01:41:10,867
Come on Bee, take them out!

1704
01:41:16,822 --> 01:41:18,106
Good move Bee!

1705
01:41:18,157 --> 01:41:20,114
This one is for you, A-holes!

1706
01:41:34,673 --> 01:41:36,463
If you are gonna do something,
you better do it!

1707
01:41:36,488 --> 01:41:37,321
Come on!

1708
01:41:39,195 --> 01:41:41,191
I am sick of this crap.
You fly.

1709
01:41:41,808 --> 01:41:43,015
I shoot.

1710
01:41:43,907 --> 01:41:47,250
Hey, you better let me fire this big ass
gun and make this ship go faster!

1711
01:41:50,189 --> 01:41:52,352
Listen up! Crash course.
Tracer guns.

1712
01:41:52,458 --> 01:41:55,169
Punch forward to fire, slide back to reload.

1713
01:41:55,511 --> 01:41:56,288
What?

1714
01:41:56,313 --> 01:41:57,606
Punch, hold, slide, repeat.

1715
01:41:57,630 --> 01:41:59,941
Punch, hold, slide, repeat.
Wait. What are you talking about?

1716
01:41:59,966 --> 01:42:01,229
I don't know what he means.
Good luck.

1717
01:42:01,254 --> 01:42:02,797
Where are you going?

1718
01:42:03,035 --> 01:42:04,594
To lay some hate.

1719
01:42:14,379 --> 01:42:15,254
Say it!
Ok.

1720
01:42:15,279 --> 01:42:16,629
Punch, hold, slide, repeat.

1721
01:42:16,654 --> 01:42:18,126
Punch, hold, slide, repeat.

1722
01:42:18,151 --> 01:42:18,941
Go!

1723
01:42:30,817 --> 01:42:32,176
Yeah, I got one!

1724
01:42:34,024 --> 01:42:35,416
These alien guns kick ass!

1725
01:42:38,612 --> 01:42:39,908
Come on, he is on us!

1726
01:42:40,280 --> 01:42:41,657
Bee, you got to move! Duck!

1727
01:42:44,993 --> 01:42:46,532
Bee, fire the gun!

1728
01:43:15,649 --> 01:43:16,984
That was insane!

1729
01:43:17,223 --> 01:43:18,302
Tess, you ok?

1730
01:43:27,786 --> 01:43:29,321
Ok. Sir?

1731
01:43:32,550 --> 01:43:33,923
You better have insurance!

1732
01:43:36,461 --> 01:43:37,545
Insurance?

1733
01:43:38,463 --> 01:43:39,905
It's a freaking spaceship.

1734
01:43:40,173 --> 01:43:41,981
You go get insurance on a freaking spaceship.

1735
01:43:42,006 --> 01:43:43,007
Good luck with that, buddy.

1736
01:43:44,136 --> 01:43:45,573
Is this your car?

1737
01:43:49,620 --> 01:43:51,538
Sweetie, hand me my alien gun.

1738
01:43:51,708 --> 01:43:52,709
Here you go.

1739
01:43:54,104 --> 01:43:55,105
Come here.

1740
01:43:55,697 --> 01:43:57,574
Trust your dad.
Ok.

1741
01:44:04,531 --> 01:44:07,137
Prepare for interstellar launch.

1742
01:44:15,909 --> 01:44:17,853
We are almost ready to separate.
We are almost there.

1743
01:44:17,878 --> 01:44:20,134
Hurry, he is launching!
All over it, chief.

1744
01:44:20,159 --> 01:44:23,495
Lockdown will be in deep space
before he realizes I am gone.

1745
01:44:23,519 --> 01:44:25,677
I am a sucky pilot, but let's give it a whirl.

1746
01:44:25,761 --> 01:44:27,096
Hell, yeah!

1747
01:44:35,896 --> 01:44:38,040
You CIA guys are really subtle.

1748
01:44:38,190 --> 01:44:40,873
What a deft hand.
I am sure nobody noticed all that.

1749
01:44:41,026 --> 01:44:41,805
Look.

1750
01:44:41,829 --> 01:44:43,695
In a few minutes, there are
gonna be feds all over this place,

1751
01:44:43,739 --> 01:44:45,783
and I don't want them finding our Holy Grail.

1752
01:44:46,062 --> 01:44:49,065
So we are gonna take all our R&D, we are
moving it to our China facility.

1753
01:44:49,242 --> 01:44:50,154
Yeah.

1754
01:44:50,369 --> 01:44:51,690
I want you to bring me the Seed,

1755
01:44:51,714 --> 01:44:53,673
but I want you to bring it to me there.

1756
01:44:54,373 --> 01:44:58,978
Mr. Joshua, I would not describe
your product testing as perfected.

1757
01:44:59,308 --> 01:45:02,167
We have plenty of time for
improvements in China.

1758
01:45:02,673 --> 01:45:04,369
Sir, Galvatron.

1759
01:45:05,049 --> 01:45:07,065
He was...
A fiasco.

1760
01:45:07,552 --> 01:45:08,679
A farrago.

1761
01:45:09,054 --> 01:45:10,180
An embarrassment.

1762
01:45:10,889 --> 01:45:11,960
And he spoke.

1763
01:45:12,077 --> 01:45:13,241
How did that happen?

1764
01:45:13,266 --> 01:45:14,851
Do you know what a flaw is, Wembley?
A flaw?

1765
01:45:15,227 --> 01:45:18,447
A flaw, is a total failure.

1766
01:45:18,897 --> 01:45:21,094
I did not have control over my prototype,

1767
01:45:21,118 --> 01:45:23,902
and I want, to know, why?

1768
01:45:42,004 --> 01:45:44,284
Let's give Bumblebee the good news.

1769
01:45:44,308 --> 01:45:46,458
We got a ship now. We are leaving.

1770
01:45:47,009 --> 01:45:48,361
You humans.

1771
01:45:48,611 --> 01:45:50,143
After all we have done.

1772
01:45:51,013 --> 01:45:53,713
You don't know what you have
wrought upon yourselves.

1773
01:45:53,849 --> 01:45:54,669
What?

1774
01:45:54,693 --> 01:45:55,993
What is it now?
What are you talking about?

1775
01:45:56,018 --> 01:45:57,948
I mean, I am doing stuff
out of my league here!

1776
01:45:58,020 --> 01:46:00,687
You don't see who is controlling who.

1777
01:46:01,398 --> 01:46:04,067
Within that man made prototype I fought,

1778
01:46:04,526 --> 01:46:06,851
I sensed the presence...

1779
01:46:07,362 --> 01:46:08,697
of Megatron.

1780
01:46:09,990 --> 01:46:12,177
What, the Decepticon
that started the Chicago war?

1781
01:46:12,575 --> 01:46:15,203
How do you think KSI built those
bots in the first place?

1782
01:46:15,521 --> 01:46:18,314
They had a whole mess of
dead Decepticon heads

1783
01:46:18,338 --> 01:46:20,138
and they were downloading their minds!

1784
01:46:20,292 --> 01:46:22,210
And I was in charge of autopsy duty.

1785
01:46:22,335 --> 01:46:25,182
No union, no benefits, no nothing.

1786
01:46:25,505 --> 01:46:27,313
They hooked me up to Megatron,

1787
01:46:27,338 --> 01:46:29,322
and that mind was not
as dead as they thought.

1788
01:46:29,416 --> 01:46:31,487
He fed them the science and specs!

1789
01:46:31,571 --> 01:46:34,365
Also they could build him
a brand-new body.

1790
01:46:35,515 --> 01:46:37,212
Then he infected it,

1791
01:46:37,236 --> 01:46:39,304
with his evil nasty chromosomes.

1792
01:46:40,645 --> 01:46:42,509
They had red beady eyes.

1793
01:46:42,591 --> 01:46:44,207
They got all in my lovely locks.

1794
01:46:44,232 --> 01:46:45,851
Oh, I can smell it right now.

1795
01:46:45,984 --> 01:46:47,986
Total inside custom job!

1796
01:46:49,738 --> 01:46:53,408
KSI might have named the body
the snappy name of Galvatron,

1797
01:46:53,492 --> 01:46:56,328
but that's just Megatron reincarnated!

1798
01:46:56,661 --> 01:46:58,330
You knew this and you didn't warn them?

1799
01:46:58,413 --> 01:46:59,484
Little girl,

1800
01:46:59,508 --> 01:47:02,560
you can go to a pretty
dark place when you on death row.

1801
01:47:02,834 --> 01:47:05,810
He is been playing KSI all this time,

1802
01:47:05,962 --> 01:47:09,938
also that he could manipulate
them into going after the Seed.

1803
01:47:11,176 --> 01:47:12,422
Wait. The Seed?

1804
01:47:12,447 --> 01:47:14,908
Those nasty soldiers that were chasing us.

1805
01:47:15,013 --> 01:47:18,105
I saw them board the ship and they took
something that they called the Seed.

1806
01:47:18,130 --> 01:47:20,338
Listen. Sixty million years ago,

1807
01:47:20,362 --> 01:47:21,676
give or take an eon...

1808
01:47:21,770 --> 01:47:25,107
Thousands of planets were
cyber-formed with Seeds.

1809
01:47:28,860 --> 01:47:32,900
They turned your organic life
into our elemental metals.

1810
01:47:34,658 --> 01:47:36,271
Our creators,

1811
01:47:36,295 --> 01:47:39,728
destroyed your world to make us.

1812
01:47:39,913 --> 01:47:42,624
And that's what Galvatron wants
to happen again.

1813
01:47:42,958 --> 01:47:46,962
He wants to detonate that Seed in
the biggest city and kill millions!

1814
01:47:47,087 --> 01:47:50,140
He is gonna show the world,
Baby I am back.

1815
01:47:50,590 --> 01:47:54,761
The blast wave will incinerate
that city into molten metal.

1816
01:47:55,095 --> 01:47:58,056
He will have enough
to build a massive army

1817
01:47:58,306 --> 01:48:01,935
and annihilate your species forever.

1818
01:48:02,227 --> 01:48:05,021
You dumb, greedy bastards just
brought extinction to yourself.

1819
01:48:05,230 --> 01:48:06,343
Not my problem though.

1820
01:48:06,367 --> 01:48:07,816
I am free at last.

1821
01:48:07,899 --> 01:48:10,168
Whole thing worked out good for me.
I am walking.

1822
01:48:10,193 --> 01:48:11,965
We got to get the Seed
before Galvatron does.

1823
01:48:27,460 --> 01:48:30,322
The Seed is going to be
the salvation of our company.

1824
01:48:31,089 --> 01:48:32,966
We take delivery tonight.

1825
01:48:33,047 --> 01:48:36,156
And next month, we detonate
safely in the Mongolian desert.

1826
01:48:36,636 --> 01:48:38,416
And we will create enough
Transformium,

1827
01:48:39,471 --> 01:48:40,882
for a hundred years.

1828
01:48:45,061 --> 01:48:48,023
Dad, I am tired of running and stealing.

1829
01:48:48,106 --> 01:48:49,816
Well, a place to sleep.

1830
01:48:49,900 --> 01:48:51,943
Yeah. Just another break-in.

1831
01:48:57,959 --> 01:48:59,293
You know, when I was your age,

1832
01:49:00,126 --> 01:49:01,606
I liked to get a little wild.

1833
01:49:01,934 --> 01:49:03,391
I liked cars, girls.

1834
01:49:07,167 --> 01:49:08,510
But then there was Tessa.

1835
01:49:09,419 --> 01:49:11,476
And when she was born,
all I ever wanted out of life

1836
01:49:11,501 --> 01:49:13,586
was for her to be happy
and healthy and safe.

1837
01:49:14,591 --> 01:49:17,028
Somehow I thought I would always
be enough to protect her.

1838
01:49:19,387 --> 01:49:20,630
But I won't be.

1839
01:49:21,306 --> 01:49:22,677
I will never be.

1840
01:49:24,366 --> 01:49:25,998
So somebody better be.

1841
01:49:31,274 --> 01:49:33,260
Thanks for being here today,
Lucky Charms.

1842
01:49:36,404 --> 01:49:38,823
Well, thanks for not shooting
me when you had the chance.

1843
01:49:39,696 --> 01:49:40,822
Oh, I will have more.

1844
01:49:42,452 --> 01:49:44,120
Yeah, I can see that.

1845
01:49:45,038 --> 01:49:47,742
We have intercepted the
encrypted communications.

1846
01:49:48,250 --> 01:49:52,384
Joshua Joyce is headed to his
factory in Guangzhou, China.

1847
01:49:53,536 --> 01:49:54,645
Hey, big shot.

1848
01:49:56,299 --> 01:49:58,145
Your company is in serious trouble.

1849
01:49:58,426 --> 01:50:00,161
You better have a damn good lawyer.

1850
01:50:00,303 --> 01:50:01,207
<i>Really?</i>

1851
01:50:01,387 --> 01:50:02,346
Well, you better have a great one

1852
01:50:02,371 --> 01:50:04,716
because you are about to be responsible
for the annihilation of a city.

1853
01:50:05,183 --> 01:50:06,393
<i>Now, you listen to me.</i>

1854
01:50:06,476 --> 01:50:08,910
<i>Your tech has been hacked.
Your prototypes are infected.</i>

1855
01:50:08,937 --> 01:50:11,106
And now Galvatron is after that Seed.

1856
01:50:11,356 --> 01:50:13,053
<i>Look. I know you have a conscience,</i>

1857
01:50:13,077 --> 01:50:14,609
<i>because you are
an inventor, like me.</i>

1858
01:50:14,693 --> 01:50:17,488
<i>Do not let Galvatron anywhere near that Seed.</i>

1859
01:50:17,696 --> 01:50:20,156
I control Galvatron.
I created him.

1860
01:50:20,865 --> 01:50:22,325
Deep down, I know you know.

1861
01:50:23,451 --> 01:50:25,611
<i>Your prototype is been controlling you.</i>

1862
01:50:29,686 --> 01:50:31,780
How fast can that thing get us
halfway around the world?

1863
01:50:32,382 --> 01:50:34,733
Very. It's a spaceship.

1864
01:50:52,234 --> 01:50:53,510
If we are traveling,

1865
01:50:54,002 --> 01:50:55,328
now is the time.

1866
01:50:56,716 --> 01:50:59,734
All I want is to have our life back.
It's your call. Whatever you want.

1867
01:51:05,452 --> 01:51:07,438
Are we safer on our own,
or are we safer with them?

1868
01:51:17,047 --> 01:51:18,240
She is a keeper.

1869
01:51:19,366 --> 01:51:20,725
Must take after her mom.

1870
01:51:22,135 --> 01:51:23,996
I can't argue with that, kid.

1871
01:51:25,472 --> 01:51:26,468
Move!

1872
01:51:27,011 --> 01:51:28,752
We are retrieving the Seed,

1873
01:51:28,777 --> 01:51:31,686
but then we are done defending the humans.

1874
01:51:31,770 --> 01:51:32,882
What, done?

1875
01:51:33,363 --> 01:51:35,385
What do you mean, you are done?
Means finished,

1876
01:51:35,409 --> 01:51:37,301
see ya, good-bye.

1877
01:51:51,790 --> 01:51:53,653
Hijacked part of my ship?

1878
01:51:53,677 --> 01:51:55,752
How did you let this happen?

1879
01:51:55,835 --> 01:51:59,144
Shut down dark-matter drive,
reverse course at light speed,

1880
01:51:59,169 --> 01:52:00,587
and get us back!

1881
01:52:00,882 --> 01:52:03,407
Prime is taken my trophy case.

1882
01:52:04,010 --> 01:52:06,596
And he will feel my wrath!

1883
01:52:14,187 --> 01:52:15,632
Welcome to China.

1884
01:52:15,657 --> 01:52:18,534
Put Galvatron in containment.
Tell the techs, do not activate him.

1885
01:52:18,775 --> 01:52:19,818
Absolutely sir.

1886
01:52:20,110 --> 01:52:21,460
I want security on high alert.

1887
01:52:25,073 --> 01:52:26,090
Joyce.

1888
01:52:26,839 --> 01:52:30,410
I cannot tell you how enthused
I am to deliver this.

1889
01:52:33,599 --> 01:52:35,306
Top of your alien wish list.

1890
01:52:35,841 --> 01:52:37,572
It's yours. Or rather...

1891
01:52:37,939 --> 01:52:39,064
ours.

1892
01:52:41,548 --> 01:52:43,366
I will need to see my advance.

1893
01:52:43,883 --> 01:52:46,169
Five million shares of the company.

1894
01:52:46,553 --> 01:52:48,358
Together, we are gonna end human warfare.

1895
01:52:48,930 --> 01:52:51,433
We are about to build
a fully automated U.S. Army.

1896
01:52:51,516 --> 01:52:54,511
Just think of all the American
lives we are gonna save.

1897
01:53:03,945 --> 01:53:08,825
All of these cars are KSI's
newest civilian prototype robots.

1898
01:53:09,242 --> 01:53:11,578
So how soon until we can
start continuous production?

1899
01:53:23,210 --> 01:53:24,786
You know, why don't we take a beat...

1900
01:53:25,070 --> 01:53:26,037
on this...

1901
01:53:26,499 --> 01:53:27,539
for a minute?

1902
01:53:28,178 --> 01:53:29,749
I have some new data...

1903
01:53:29,956 --> 01:53:31,251
that I discovered and...

1904
01:53:31,275 --> 01:53:32,585
You are not backing out on me here?
No,

1905
01:53:32,609 --> 01:53:33,932
I am not backing out. I just...

1906
01:53:34,017 --> 01:53:36,540
I want the Seed.
I am not saying I don't want the Seed.

1907
01:53:36,565 --> 01:53:38,310
I am just saying I don't know if I...

1908
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:40,565
If I want the Seed right now.

1909
01:53:40,899 --> 01:53:44,235
Good men have died trying
to get that thing for us.

1910
01:53:44,360 --> 01:53:45,403
For you.

1911
01:53:45,904 --> 01:53:47,721
I know what you did to get that thing.

1912
01:53:48,072 --> 01:53:50,033
A lot of illegal, icky shit.

1913
01:53:50,689 --> 01:53:52,522
I can take you down too, Mr. Black Ops.

1914
01:53:52,546 --> 01:53:53,846
Don't you threaten me.

1915
01:53:54,245 --> 01:53:56,372
I started this company when I was a boy,

1916
01:53:56,456 --> 01:53:59,125
with a dream of making the world a better place.

1917
01:53:59,209 --> 01:54:00,029
Funny.

1918
01:54:00,374 --> 01:54:01,757
I had the same dream.

1919
01:54:02,743 --> 01:54:03,866
Somewhere along the way,

1920
01:54:04,225 --> 01:54:05,960
you made billions of dollars.

1921
01:54:06,483 --> 01:54:08,646
So why don't you tell me
what's missing from my dream?

1922
01:54:08,671 --> 01:54:11,095
Why don't you tell me what's
missing from my boyhood dream?

1923
01:54:12,300 --> 01:54:14,669
I have served my country,

1924
01:54:14,693 --> 01:54:17,384
for decades of unparalleled prosperity

1925
01:54:17,409 --> 01:54:20,081
and you are my golden parachute.

1926
01:54:20,230 --> 01:54:21,384
So you are damn well,

1927
01:54:21,501 --> 01:54:23,722
jumping out of the plane with me!

1928
01:54:34,953 --> 01:54:37,539
I am Galvatron!

1929
01:54:38,851 --> 01:54:40,486
<font color="#f4ff7a">Galvatron suddenly started!</font>

1930
01:54:40,510 --> 01:54:42,445
<font color="#f4ff7a">What happened!</font>

1931
01:54:43,326 --> 01:54:44,365
What's going on?

1932
01:54:44,389 --> 01:54:46,564
Your Galvatron has gone active.

1933
01:54:47,632 --> 01:54:49,092
What have not you been telling me?

1934
01:54:49,117 --> 01:54:50,030
Find Darcy,

1935
01:54:50,054 --> 01:54:51,601
and bring a car
around downstairs.

1936
01:54:51,625 --> 01:54:52,440
Quietly.

1937
01:54:53,388 --> 01:54:55,760
We got a factory emergency.
I have to get you out of here.

1938
01:54:55,974 --> 01:54:57,981
What the hell is going on?
Take them outside.

1939
01:54:58,006 --> 01:55:00,184
We had a deal.
You got what you wanted.

1940
01:55:00,979 --> 01:55:02,395
I got what it wanted.

1941
01:55:04,148 --> 01:55:05,637
My brothers,

1942
01:55:05,872 --> 01:55:08,864
today I grant you your freedom.

1943
01:55:09,119 --> 01:55:10,530
And from now on,

1944
01:55:10,554 --> 01:55:13,463
you are commanded by me.

1945
01:55:14,768 --> 01:55:15,674
Rise up!

1946
01:55:18,162 --> 01:55:20,597
Go find my Seed!

1947
01:55:34,679 --> 01:55:36,459
Detonate the Seed,

1948
01:55:36,624 --> 01:55:38,313
in the largest city.

1949
01:55:40,018 --> 01:55:42,205
Listen, princess. I don't wanna hear,
I told you so,

1950
01:55:42,236 --> 01:55:43,955
but this is much more dangerous than I think.

1951
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:44,978
Get in.

1952
01:55:51,696 --> 01:55:53,281
Galvatron is hacked into the others.

1953
01:55:53,306 --> 01:55:54,766
What?
Joshua.

1954
01:55:54,907 --> 01:55:56,564
You have to contain this!
Drive, drive!

1955
01:55:56,829 --> 01:55:57,799
Son of a...

1956
01:56:00,830 --> 01:56:02,703
Come on. Let's move,
let's move, let's move!

1957
01:56:19,009 --> 01:56:20,803
I know how to lose them in Hong Kong.

1958
01:56:21,059 --> 01:56:22,672
I know a military garrison there,

1959
01:56:22,914 --> 01:56:24,082
that will help us.

1960
01:56:24,771 --> 01:56:26,863
Threatening a professional CIA killer.

1961
01:56:28,066 --> 01:56:29,721
Possibly not my finest hour.

1962
01:56:29,745 --> 01:56:31,027
I woud like to have that one back.

1963
01:56:31,075 --> 01:56:33,144
Killer? I thought they were your friends!

1964
01:56:33,321 --> 01:56:34,934
No. Not friends. Business.

1965
01:56:34,958 --> 01:56:36,332
They gave me this bomb.

1966
01:56:36,357 --> 01:56:37,262
Bomb?

1967
01:56:38,308 --> 01:56:39,494
Is there a bomb in the bag?

1968
01:56:39,577 --> 01:56:41,063
Yes, there is a bomb in the bag.

1969
01:56:41,746 --> 01:56:42,713
Shit.

1970
01:56:53,257 --> 01:56:55,009
When you said you were
done fighting for humans,

1971
01:56:55,093 --> 01:56:56,351
you didn't mean that, did you?

1972
01:56:57,303 --> 01:57:00,682
How many more of my kind must be sacrificed

1973
01:57:00,765 --> 01:57:03,101
to atone for your mistakes?

1974
01:57:03,309 --> 01:57:05,504
Well, what do you think being human means?
That's what we do.

1975
01:57:06,229 --> 01:57:07,730
We make mistakes.

1976
01:57:08,606 --> 01:57:11,363
And sometimes out of those mistakes
come the most amazing things.

1977
01:57:16,668 --> 01:57:18,019
When I fixed you,

1978
01:57:18,645 --> 01:57:19,911
it was for a reward.

1979
01:57:20,094 --> 01:57:21,731
That was it. That was why.

1980
01:57:22,372 --> 01:57:23,305
For money.

1981
01:57:24,840 --> 01:57:26,596
And it was me making a mistake.

1982
01:57:27,677 --> 01:57:29,432
Without it, you would not be here.

1983
01:57:32,630 --> 01:57:34,410
So even if you got no faith in us,

1984
01:57:34,701 --> 01:57:36,312
I am asking you to do what I do.

1985
01:57:36,818 --> 01:57:39,007
I am asking you to look at all
the junk and see the treasure.

1986
01:57:40,348 --> 01:57:41,746
You got to have faith Prime,

1987
01:57:42,742 --> 01:57:44,077
in who we can be.

1988
01:57:56,195 --> 01:57:58,573
I am seriously pissed we are
not getting paid for this.

1989
01:57:59,415 --> 01:58:00,269
Well,

1990
01:58:00,691 --> 01:58:02,149
at least we get to kill him.

1991
01:58:02,702 --> 01:58:04,991
They are not getting away
if I still got him on satellite.

1992
01:58:05,663 --> 01:58:06,692
Some genius.

1993
01:58:06,716 --> 01:58:08,332
Thinks he can outrun the CIA.

1994
01:58:10,168 --> 01:58:11,522
Joshua? Yes?

1995
01:58:11,627 --> 01:58:13,366
How lethal is that bomb?

1996
01:58:13,880 --> 01:58:15,339
I don't know. Let me check.

1997
01:58:22,094 --> 01:58:24,305
I love this! This is so good.
Oh, hang on.

1998
01:58:25,836 --> 01:58:28,078
I am getting a text from il Duce in Hong Kong.

1999
01:58:29,017 --> 01:58:31,561
Need to know the Seed's estimated blast range.

2000
01:58:31,965 --> 01:58:32,532
Duh.

2001
01:58:41,991 --> 01:58:44,692
I will do the diversion!
Get that thing somewhere safe!

2002
01:58:45,872 --> 01:58:46,708
Hey! Hey! Hey!

2003
01:58:46,763 --> 01:58:48,474
<font color="#f4ff7a">Your moto, how much?
What's the matter?</font>

2004
01:58:48,654 --> 01:58:50,576
<font color="#f4ff7a">How much, I buy it?
Buy it?</font>

2005
01:58:50,630 --> 01:58:51,821
<font color="#f4ff7a">I give you 30,000.</font>
Killers are coming!

2006
01:58:51,845 --> 01:58:52,825
<font color="#f4ff7a">You accept it?</font>
Guys, we got to go!

2007
01:58:52,850 --> 01:58:54,612
<font color="#f4ff7a">You want to buy it only 30,000?</font>
Guys, guys...

2008
01:58:54,637 --> 01:58:56,012
Shut up! Shut up!
Alright! I am sorry!

2009
01:58:56,037 --> 01:58:56,880
Alright, go ahead, go ahead!

2010
01:58:56,905 --> 01:58:58,319
<font color="#f4ff7a">I paid in cash.
No, I won't sell it. No.</font>

2011
01:58:58,344 --> 01:59:00,074
<font color="#f4ff7a">You don't sell it, we will find another one.
I won't sell it for this amount.</font>

2012
01:59:00,099 --> 01:59:02,459
Ok, good? No, don't go!
Wait!

2013
01:59:02,521 --> 01:59:04,375
<font color="#f4ff7a">Ok deal.</font>
Ok, he is in.

2014
01:59:04,975 --> 01:59:06,521
<font color="#f4ff7a">Bad guy.</font>
Ok, ok, ok.

2015
01:59:06,933 --> 01:59:08,993
I need a raise! I want a raise.

2016
01:59:09,018 --> 01:59:10,417
Alright, yes!
I am sure whatever you want!

2017
01:59:14,774 --> 01:59:15,817
Go, go, go!

2018
01:59:18,069 --> 01:59:19,357
Oh, no!

2019
01:59:21,948 --> 01:59:23,967
Death is on our tail!
Death is on our tail!

2020
01:59:30,957 --> 01:59:32,508
Get out of the way, all of you!

2021
01:59:32,532 --> 01:59:33,751
Get out of the way!

2022
01:59:35,878 --> 01:59:37,672
I don't want to die like this.

2023
01:59:53,271 --> 01:59:54,496
Box them in.

2024
02:00:08,619 --> 02:00:09,787
Hurry, hurry! Come, come.

2025
02:00:09,812 --> 02:00:12,026
Ok, yes. I will follow you anywhere.
You are amazing!

2026
02:00:12,123 --> 02:00:13,666
We are going to get you to the roof.

2027
02:00:13,727 --> 02:00:14,750
Good, good.

2028
02:00:20,534 --> 02:00:21,328
Go!

2029
02:00:29,678 --> 02:00:31,021
Like a tactical nuke.

2030
02:00:32,435 --> 02:00:34,103
LOL. That's funny.

2031
02:00:34,979 --> 02:00:36,729
I can't... This is really happening.

2032
02:00:36,814 --> 02:00:38,010
A man, me,

2033
02:00:38,034 --> 02:00:39,845
who is worth over 20 billion dollars,

2034
02:00:39,869 --> 02:00:40,818
is now...

2035
02:00:41,319 --> 02:00:43,808
being chased by CIA assassins.

2036
02:00:43,832 --> 02:00:44,822
That's the truth.

2037
02:00:45,740 --> 02:00:48,034
And in the middle of a robot uprising.

2038
02:00:50,620 --> 02:00:54,096
And I am carrying what is, in
essence, a tactical nuke.

2039
02:00:54,506 --> 02:00:56,233
And the great thing is I...

2040
02:00:56,257 --> 02:00:57,476
The great thing is that I am...

2041
02:00:57,501 --> 02:00:59,320
I am barely feeling any jet lag.

2042
02:00:59,345 --> 02:01:00,859
Just stop it!
What?

2043
02:01:01,005 --> 02:01:02,952
You need to hide on the roof of this building.

2044
02:01:03,049 --> 02:01:04,859
I will get you a helicopter extraction.

2045
02:01:07,511 --> 02:01:08,473
Ok.

2046
02:01:11,682 --> 02:01:12,604
I like her.

2047
02:01:13,726 --> 02:01:15,042
I find her very attractive.

2048
02:01:16,896 --> 02:01:18,325
He is definitely around here.

2049
02:01:19,357 --> 02:01:20,567
Come on, come on.

2050
02:01:22,818 --> 02:01:23,981
I got a bike!

2051
02:01:24,820 --> 02:01:26,015
Check in there!

2052
02:01:26,822 --> 02:01:28,976
These are the CIA assassins
I told you about.

2053
02:01:32,912 --> 02:01:34,455
Guys.
Let's go.

2054
02:01:35,748 --> 02:01:37,070
Hello.

2055
02:01:43,331 --> 02:01:43,951
Hey!

2056
02:01:44,560 --> 02:01:45,334
Ok.

2057
02:01:51,931 --> 02:01:53,307
Pick it up.
Alright. I am gonna.

2058
02:02:10,634 --> 02:02:11,466
Thank you.

2059
02:02:12,220 --> 02:02:13,160
How did you...

2060
02:02:13,452 --> 02:02:15,819
Police training, prior to my MBA.

2061
02:02:16,539 --> 02:02:17,623
I love you.

2062
02:02:19,239 --> 02:02:20,952
Get to the roof.
Alright, ok.

2063
02:03:16,432 --> 02:03:19,329
Find my Seed. It's here!

2064
02:03:19,602 --> 02:03:21,312
Those prototypes are after that bomb.

2065
02:03:30,631 --> 02:03:31,363
No!

2066
02:03:32,323 --> 02:03:34,158
No, no, no, no!

2067
02:03:37,995 --> 02:03:39,288
Who the hell is aboard that?

2068
02:03:39,663 --> 02:03:41,025
Impossible.

2069
02:03:48,831 --> 02:03:49,702
Brothers,

2070
02:03:50,015 --> 02:03:51,453
it's the Autobots!

2071
02:03:52,195 --> 02:03:53,589
Shoot them down!

2072
02:03:58,849 --> 02:03:59,824
Joshua!

2073
02:03:59,849 --> 02:04:01,160
Hey, Baldy!

2074
02:04:01,435 --> 02:04:02,855
Hey, it's me! Hey!

2075
02:04:02,880 --> 02:04:04,441
Bring it over now! Let's go.

2076
02:04:05,189 --> 02:04:06,449
Hurry up, run!

2077
02:04:07,108 --> 02:04:09,147
Hurry! Come on!
Let's go! Move it!

2078
02:04:09,172 --> 02:04:11,591
Guys! Come on.
Give it to me now!

2079
02:04:12,196 --> 02:04:13,823
Looks like we might have company.

2080
02:04:24,041 --> 02:04:25,509
We are hit! We are hit!

2081
02:04:51,652 --> 02:04:53,140
They live, they talk,

2082
02:04:53,484 --> 02:04:54,456
we are dead.

2083
02:04:55,239 --> 02:04:57,241
Kill them all.
Pleasure.

2084
02:04:59,660 --> 02:05:01,543
I count ten below!

2085
02:05:03,100 --> 02:05:05,186
I thought you said you had
one prototype get infected.

2086
02:05:05,249 --> 02:05:07,509
Now he is got operational
control of my other 50.

2087
02:05:07,534 --> 02:05:08,543
Come on.

2088
02:05:10,337 --> 02:05:12,423
Climb, climb!

2089
02:05:12,840 --> 02:05:14,842
Surround them.

2090
02:05:19,430 --> 02:05:21,168
I may have started the apocalypse,

2091
02:05:21,192 --> 02:05:22,349
but you brought your family.

2092
02:05:22,433 --> 02:05:24,569
And that's, you know, terrible parenting.

2093
02:05:24,643 --> 02:05:26,317
Oh, I am about one second
away from knocking you out,

2094
02:05:26,342 --> 02:05:27,795
taking the bomb
and just leaving you here.

2095
02:05:27,856 --> 02:05:29,274
Please, do me a favor.

2096
02:05:29,523 --> 02:05:31,842
Optimus, Autobots, you alive?

2097
02:05:32,226 --> 02:05:33,640
Come on, bitch!
Come on!

2098
02:05:45,748 --> 02:05:46,957
Evac! Evac!

2099
02:05:47,084 --> 02:05:48,253
We are getting flanked!

2100
02:05:50,211 --> 02:05:51,629
We got company below!

2101
02:05:55,264 --> 02:05:57,121
My fat ass is stuck!

2102
02:05:57,145 --> 02:05:58,594
Bee, take the shot!

2103
02:06:08,938 --> 02:06:10,481
Into the elevator! Get in.
Ok.

2104
02:06:10,564 --> 02:06:11,367
Come on.

2105
02:06:14,985 --> 02:06:16,403
Get down!

2106
02:06:17,112 --> 02:06:18,489
Close the door!
Close the door!

2107
02:06:21,450 --> 02:06:23,135
Won't go! It's not closing!

2108
02:06:23,160 --> 02:06:24,227
There is too much weight.

2109
02:06:24,662 --> 02:06:26,431
Get back down to Bumblebee!
Dad, no!

2110
02:06:26,456 --> 02:06:27,359
Hey!

2111
02:06:28,187 --> 02:06:29,393
You want me!

2112
02:06:39,551 --> 02:06:40,552
Center elevator.

2113
02:06:40,577 --> 02:06:41,791
<i>Center elevator.</i>

2114
02:06:46,350 --> 02:06:47,646
He is gonna be ok.

2115
02:07:00,619 --> 02:07:03,647
Alien bomb! Alien bomb, coming through!

2116
02:07:03,993 --> 02:07:05,843
Clear the way! Clear the...
Hi, kids.

2117
02:07:05,918 --> 02:07:07,211
Coming through, ladies!

2118
02:07:07,334 --> 02:07:08,400
Excuse me!

2119
02:07:08,770 --> 02:07:09,890
Excuse me, ladies!
Excuse me!

2120
02:07:10,047 --> 02:07:11,048
Oh, my God!

2121
02:07:11,238 --> 02:07:13,198
How do you say,
Get the fuck out of the way in Chinese?

2122
02:07:58,203 --> 02:08:00,239
That's a long way down.

2123
02:08:03,401 --> 02:08:04,611
You have got to be kidding me.

2124
02:08:06,555 --> 02:08:07,275
No!

2125
02:08:20,486 --> 02:08:21,570
Come on.

2126
02:08:33,954 --> 02:08:35,289
I am coming for you!

2127
02:09:10,285 --> 02:09:11,995
Never should have hidden that truck.

2128
02:09:12,329 --> 02:09:14,081
You should have never came after my family.

2129
02:09:14,164 --> 02:09:15,444
Tough luck, Yeager.

2130
02:09:15,694 --> 02:09:17,132
We all have family.

2131
02:09:17,793 --> 02:09:19,336
Yeah, but I am gonna live to see mine.

2132
02:09:43,026 --> 02:09:45,821
<i>Where is my escaped bounty?</i>

2133
02:09:45,904 --> 02:09:47,498
Autobots at this location.

2134
02:09:48,365 --> 02:09:49,685
Prime is close.

2135
02:09:51,702 --> 02:09:53,412
Do whatever you have to do.

2136
02:09:54,872 --> 02:09:56,373
I intend to.

2137
02:09:58,979 --> 02:10:00,606
Darcy!
Joshua!

2138
02:10:00,631 --> 02:10:02,113
We got three more coming in from that way!

2139
02:10:02,138 --> 02:10:03,394
Bee, where is Tessa?

2140
02:10:04,800 --> 02:10:05,558
Dad!

2141
02:10:08,635 --> 02:10:10,249
We got a real dilemma here. Ok?

2142
02:10:10,273 --> 02:10:11,847
I created incredible robots.

2143
02:10:11,930 --> 02:10:14,475
It's all designed to kick
that fat Transformer's ass.

2144
02:10:14,500 --> 02:10:17,253
So, really, this is a no-win situation.

2145
02:10:17,453 --> 02:10:18,559
It's over.

2146
02:10:19,067 --> 02:10:20,425
That was mean.
Hey!

2147
02:10:20,840 --> 02:10:23,233
I am sorry if you can't
handle the cold-hearted truth!

2148
02:10:23,400 --> 02:10:26,111
<i>Optimus, what are my orders
with these humans?</i>

2149
02:10:26,195 --> 02:10:27,631
<i>Can I squish the bald guy?</i>

2150
02:10:27,671 --> 02:10:29,089
They are in trouble.

2151
02:10:29,172 --> 02:10:30,966
Nah! This isn't our fight!

2152
02:10:31,050 --> 02:10:32,705
I am done being an underdog.

2153
02:10:32,729 --> 02:10:33,844
Underdogs suck!

2154
02:10:33,869 --> 02:10:35,704
I say they get what they deserve.

2155
02:10:35,787 --> 02:10:37,115
What's the play, Prime?

2156
02:10:37,354 --> 02:10:40,106
It's time for reinforcements.

2157
02:10:42,669 --> 02:10:45,839
Recognize one of your Knights.

2158
02:11:06,026 --> 02:11:09,111
The legend exists.

2159
02:11:16,203 --> 02:11:17,341
Come on.

2160
02:11:18,887 --> 02:11:20,016
Alright, come on, come on.

2161
02:11:20,040 --> 02:11:20,889
Let's go!

2162
02:11:21,069 --> 02:11:22,082
Bee go!

2163
02:11:26,797 --> 02:11:28,789
Come on, we got to move!
Let's go, move!

2164
02:11:32,640 --> 02:11:33,699
Where is Tessa?

2165
02:11:33,723 --> 02:11:35,239
Tessa, get over here!
Come on.

2166
02:11:35,646 --> 02:11:36,624
Get over here!

2167
02:11:37,224 --> 02:11:39,142
Stay behind me!
I am covering you!

2168
02:11:39,226 --> 02:11:41,603
If I stop covering you,
it means I am dead.

2169
02:11:41,687 --> 02:11:42,938
But that ain't gonna happen.

2170
02:11:44,273 --> 02:11:45,230
Take that!

2171
02:11:47,818 --> 02:11:50,320
I am a wicked warrior robot!

2172
02:11:51,203 --> 02:11:52,316
Goddamn!

2173
02:11:52,406 --> 02:11:53,574
Come on! We got to move now!

2174
02:11:55,158 --> 02:11:56,012
Go, go!

2175
02:12:02,583 --> 02:12:04,395
We got hostiles coming down the street!

2176
02:12:06,336 --> 02:12:07,121
Go!

2177
02:12:12,175 --> 02:12:14,392
Bee! Twelve o'clock! Cover fire!

2178
02:12:18,593 --> 02:12:19,886
We are surrounded!

2179
02:12:19,911 --> 02:12:21,455
Hustle, hustle, hustle!

2180
02:12:21,573 --> 02:12:22,616
Rocket!

2181
02:12:23,520 --> 02:12:24,563
Go, go, go!

2182
02:12:24,730 --> 02:12:25,856
Get down!

2183
02:12:28,917 --> 02:12:30,502
Oh, this is the perfect place to hide.

2184
02:12:30,527 --> 02:12:31,848
A big glass box!

2185
02:12:31,872 --> 02:12:33,551
Nobody will ever find us here! That's...

2186
02:12:37,129 --> 02:12:39,298
You have got to be kidding me.

2187
02:12:39,870 --> 02:12:41,691
Legendary warriors,

2188
02:12:41,942 --> 02:12:44,041
the powers that created us

2189
02:12:44,124 --> 02:12:46,377
now want us all extinguished.

2190
02:12:46,960 --> 02:12:48,878
We must join forces,

2191
02:12:49,097 --> 02:12:52,030
or else forever be their slaves.

2192
02:12:52,799 --> 02:12:55,545
So today you stand with us...

2193
02:12:56,094 --> 02:13:00,148
or you stand against me.

2194
02:13:06,897 --> 02:13:08,932
We will let Prime figure this one out.

2195
02:13:08,957 --> 02:13:10,167
Very wise.

2196
02:13:10,192 --> 02:13:12,800
There is no frigging way I am
staying down here with them.

2197
02:13:12,825 --> 02:13:14,318
No way. No way.

2198
02:13:19,451 --> 02:13:20,814
Only together...

2199
02:13:21,665 --> 02:13:23,288
can we survive!

2200
02:13:24,748 --> 02:13:26,251
Let me lead you!

2201
02:13:38,095 --> 02:13:39,346
Oh, no.

2202
02:13:39,429 --> 02:13:41,682
I was expecting a giant car.

2203
02:13:41,707 --> 02:13:42,864
Come here!

2204
02:13:49,439 --> 02:13:51,908
We are giving you freedom.

2205
02:14:07,958 --> 02:14:10,669
You defend my family,

2206
02:14:12,629 --> 02:14:14,381
or die.

2207
02:14:17,384 --> 02:14:18,702
Autobots,

2208
02:14:19,177 --> 02:14:21,750
we are going to prove who we are

2209
02:14:22,172 --> 02:14:23,921
and why we are here!

2210
02:14:25,016 --> 02:14:27,394
You just want to die for the guy.

2211
02:14:27,477 --> 02:14:28,798
That's leadership.

2212
02:14:28,881 --> 02:14:30,706
Or brainwashing or something.

2213
02:14:30,816 --> 02:14:31,718
No.

2214
02:14:32,382 --> 02:14:34,442
That's Optimus Prime.

2215
02:14:40,682 --> 02:14:43,434
Autobots, we charge together!

2216
02:14:44,870 --> 02:14:46,413
Now, roll out!

2217
02:14:48,999 --> 02:14:51,608
We are getting boxed in!
We are getting flanked everywhere!

2218
02:14:51,795 --> 02:14:53,088
Help me out here!

2219
02:14:53,211 --> 02:14:54,741
Kill anything that moves!

2220
02:14:55,422 --> 02:14:57,084
Come on, Cade, shoot!

2221
02:14:59,009 --> 02:15:00,635
Come and get some, you little bitch!

2222
02:15:00,719 --> 02:15:01,993
Incoming!

2223
02:15:06,600 --> 02:15:08,581
I can't believe I am putting
my life in your hands.

2224
02:15:08,606 --> 02:15:10,014
Here. Be my guest. Take the gun.

2225
02:15:10,039 --> 02:15:11,200
Go ahead, take it.
No, I don't want the gun.

2226
02:15:11,225 --> 02:15:12,293
Come on, you can lead.
No, I don't want the gun.

2227
02:15:12,318 --> 02:15:14,177
Then stay under there and shut up!
Alright.

2228
02:15:14,201 --> 02:15:15,820
You are good with the gun.
So you keep it.

2229
02:15:20,155 --> 02:15:22,532
Running out of guns and ammo.

2230
02:15:30,624 --> 02:15:33,564
Come and get some!

2231
02:15:33,589 --> 02:15:36,559
You are all gonna die!

2232
02:15:56,942 --> 02:15:58,273
Way to go, baby!

2233
02:15:59,486 --> 02:16:00,904
Good shooting, Cade!

2234
02:16:02,739 --> 02:16:05,312
I am like a fat ballerina,

2235
02:16:05,555 --> 02:16:08,477
who takes scalps and slits throats!

2236
02:16:15,585 --> 02:16:17,318
Got your fortune cookie!

2237
02:16:18,880 --> 02:16:20,298
Come here, you little punk.

2238
02:16:23,760 --> 02:16:25,165
Pull the pin!

2239
02:16:25,415 --> 02:16:27,041
I am dying out here!

2240
02:16:27,066 --> 02:16:28,375
Here! Take it. Take it!

2241
02:16:28,400 --> 02:16:29,860
Little help! Little help!

2242
02:16:30,475 --> 02:16:31,977
It's live! It's live, it's live.
Take it!

2243
02:16:32,002 --> 02:16:33,175
What do you want me to do with it?

2244
02:16:33,200 --> 02:16:34,989
Just throw it!
Give, give, give!

2245
02:16:49,077 --> 02:16:50,967
Got some bad news, Cade.

2246
02:16:50,996 --> 02:16:53,701
I am out of ammo and out of ideas.

2247
02:17:03,133 --> 02:17:05,093
Faster! Go!

2248
02:17:12,601 --> 02:17:13,977
I will kill you!

2249
02:17:43,340 --> 02:17:45,008
Charge!

2250
02:17:56,186 --> 02:17:58,772
No, impossible!

2251
02:17:58,855 --> 02:18:01,149
They are ruining everything!

2252
02:18:02,192 --> 02:18:03,193
Take that!

2253
02:18:10,867 --> 02:18:12,166
Get off me.

2254
02:18:13,703 --> 02:18:15,455
Get up, Hound!
I can't go on.

2255
02:18:15,538 --> 02:18:17,123
But you got to keep fighting!

2256
02:18:17,207 --> 02:18:18,708
Tank is empty, bro.

2257
02:18:19,832 --> 02:18:20,739
There is more of them coming.

2258
02:18:20,763 --> 02:18:22,480
If you don't get up and fight,
we are going to die. Let's go!

2259
02:18:27,717 --> 02:18:29,219
Attack!

2260
02:18:33,264 --> 02:18:34,933
Optimus is here!

2261
02:18:46,069 --> 02:18:47,613
Bee, jump!

2262
02:20:08,276 --> 02:20:10,153
I hate cheap knockoffs.

2263
02:20:12,579 --> 02:20:13,663
Awesome job!

2264
02:20:13,703 --> 02:20:15,070
You.
Who?

2265
02:20:15,450 --> 02:20:17,328
You.
Step forward.

2266
02:20:17,406 --> 02:20:18,178
Wait. Why?

2267
02:20:18,203 --> 02:20:22,460
Your science will be responsible
for humanity's extinction.

2268
02:20:22,749 --> 02:20:24,195
Alright. I know that you are...

2269
02:20:24,358 --> 02:20:26,072
sensitive to this whole...

2270
02:20:26,225 --> 02:20:28,010
bio-ethical dilemma.

2271
02:20:28,035 --> 02:20:29,242
Maybe all he wants to hear you say is

2272
02:20:29,266 --> 02:20:30,691
that some things should never be invented.

2273
02:20:35,345 --> 02:20:36,230
Ok.

2274
02:20:36,736 --> 02:20:38,280
We will lead you out of the city.

2275
02:20:38,598 --> 02:20:41,265
Get that Seed safely to the hills.

2276
02:20:41,893 --> 02:20:43,195
Use this car.

2277
02:20:43,394 --> 02:20:44,687
He almost ate me!

2278
02:20:47,649 --> 02:20:48,567
Alright, we are good!

2279
02:20:49,567 --> 02:20:50,568
Alright, let's go!

2280
02:20:52,791 --> 02:20:53,792
Get out of that seat.

2281
02:20:55,323 --> 02:20:57,158
And you are one lucky dad to have me.

2282
02:20:58,827 --> 02:21:01,791
Ok, Lucky Charms. You got that.
You drive. Let's go.

2283
02:21:12,674 --> 02:21:13,858
What did you do?

2284
02:21:13,883 --> 02:21:16,386
I don't know. I don't...
I-I don't know but it's an issue.

2285
02:21:16,601 --> 02:21:18,006
Did you press a button?
Is it gonna blow up?

2286
02:21:18,336 --> 02:21:20,121
I don't know.
Your thing is beeping now,

2287
02:21:20,145 --> 02:21:21,968
so you must have hit something.
Is it gonna blow up?

2288
02:21:21,993 --> 02:21:22,941
I don't know!

2289
02:21:22,966 --> 02:21:25,079
A bomb starts beeping, that might
signal a problem, you think?

2290
02:21:25,104 --> 02:21:28,016
I am just saying that
it's a steady blinking light,

2291
02:21:28,148 --> 02:21:29,852
which could be a timer of some kind.

2292
02:21:30,733 --> 02:21:32,694
Unless it's signaling location.

2293
02:21:34,070 --> 02:21:35,029
To who?

2294
02:21:41,765 --> 02:21:42,656
<font color="#f4ff7a">Here they come.</font>

2295
02:21:43,163 --> 02:21:45,290
We have got to call the central
government for help!

2296
02:21:45,687 --> 02:21:46,679
<font color="#f4ff7a">I'm going to call now.</font>

2297
02:21:47,172 --> 02:21:48,164
<font color="#f4ff7a">Let's go. Hurry.</font>

2298
02:21:50,712 --> 02:21:52,419
Optimus Prime.

2299
02:21:54,257 --> 02:21:56,676
Come to me.

2300
02:22:15,433 --> 02:22:16,370
<font color="#f4ff7a">Oh fuck!</font>

2301
02:22:56,486 --> 02:22:57,487
<font color="#f4ff7a">Minister!</font>

2302
02:22:57,862 --> 02:22:58,892
<font color="#f4ff7a">Emergency!</font>

2303
02:22:59,861 --> 02:23:01,041
<font color="#f4ff7a">Wang Gu Minister.</font>

2304
02:23:04,118 --> 02:23:06,204
<font color="#f4ff7a">
Central government will support Hong Kong.</font>

2305
02:23:07,125 --> 02:23:08,632
<font color="#f4ff7a">the Jet fighter are on the way.</font>

2306
02:23:15,171 --> 02:23:16,323
There is the bridge.

2307
02:23:34,857 --> 02:23:36,393
Back it up! Back it up!

2308
02:23:36,418 --> 02:23:38,389
Go, go, go, go! Back up!

2309
02:23:38,413 --> 02:23:39,963
Go back! Go back!

2310
02:23:39,988 --> 02:23:41,708
Move! Get out of the way.
I can't see!

2311
02:23:41,733 --> 02:23:43,574
Shane, drive faster!
Ok, just calm down.

2312
02:23:56,045 --> 02:23:57,046
Shane, watch out!

2313
02:24:00,883 --> 02:24:02,942
Get cover!
Back up! Back! Back up!

2314
02:24:07,974 --> 02:24:09,432
Autobots, fall back!

2315
02:24:14,188 --> 02:24:15,940
Come on, move! Out of my way!
Get out of the way!

2316
02:24:16,024 --> 02:24:17,844
Look out!
Just hit them! Just hit them!

2317
02:24:37,670 --> 02:24:38,966
It's a big magnet!

2318
02:24:38,991 --> 02:24:40,660
It's sucking up metal and dropping it!

2319
02:24:44,010 --> 02:24:45,219
Oh!

2320
02:24:47,597 --> 02:24:48,598
Go faster! Go faster!
Move!

2321
02:24:48,681 --> 02:24:50,683
Get out of the way!
It's coming! It's coming!

2322
02:24:51,040 --> 02:24:52,541
It's coming closer!

2323
02:24:52,602 --> 02:24:53,884
Go faster, Shane!

2324
02:24:56,439 --> 02:24:57,607
Watch out, watch out!

2325
02:24:58,524 --> 02:25:00,193
Watch out!
Look out!

2326
02:25:06,115 --> 02:25:08,020
Oh, no, now it's circling back towards us!

2327
02:25:08,044 --> 02:25:09,577
Hard right! Take a hard right!

2328
02:25:10,259 --> 02:25:11,385
Move it! Get out of the way!

2329
02:25:11,496 --> 02:25:13,873
Oh, my God!

2330
02:25:28,638 --> 02:25:31,153
Oh, no. No, the magnet.
Get out, get out!

2331
02:25:31,178 --> 02:25:33,317
Come on! Come here! Get out!

2332
02:25:35,436 --> 02:25:37,313
No, no, no! No, we are going up.
Grab the bomb!

2333
02:25:37,397 --> 02:25:38,731
Help me grab the bomb!

2334
02:25:38,815 --> 02:25:39,982
I can't get the seat belt off!

2335
02:25:40,066 --> 02:25:41,651
Pull me down! Catch me!

2336
02:25:41,818 --> 02:25:43,554
I am going up! I am going up!

2337
02:25:43,579 --> 02:25:45,107
Get me! Grab me!

2338
02:25:45,295 --> 02:25:46,560
Pull me! Pull me!

2339
02:25:46,585 --> 02:25:48,997
Pull me down! Pull me! Pull me!

2340
02:25:49,138 --> 02:25:51,036
I can't get the seat belt off!
I can't get the belt off!

2341
02:25:52,495 --> 02:25:53,996
I am stuck! I am stuck!

2342
02:25:55,164 --> 02:25:56,877
Hold the bomb!
I can't hold on!

2343
02:25:57,792 --> 02:25:58,793
Pull!

2344
02:25:59,001 --> 02:26:00,705
Guys, it's crushing me!

2345
02:26:12,515 --> 02:26:13,355
Car!

2346
02:26:14,183 --> 02:26:15,309
Move!

2347
02:26:19,147 --> 02:26:20,148
Shane!

2348
02:26:20,523 --> 02:26:22,275
Shane!
I am good! I am good.

2349
02:26:22,775 --> 02:26:23,818
I am good.

2350
02:26:29,907 --> 02:26:31,402
Bumblebee!

2351
02:26:34,078 --> 02:26:35,415
Hey, you guys!

2352
02:26:37,962 --> 02:26:38,963
Come on.

2353
02:26:40,042 --> 02:26:41,210
Go find someplace safe.

2354
02:26:41,586 --> 02:26:42,879
I am proud of you.

2355
02:26:57,064 --> 02:26:58,148
Get cover!

2356
02:27:03,691 --> 02:27:04,775
Cade!

2357
02:27:06,271 --> 02:27:10,567
Autobots, get this bomb over
the bridge and out of the city!

2358
02:27:10,620 --> 02:27:11,663
Dad!

2359
02:27:12,158 --> 02:27:13,618
What? Come on.

2360
02:28:10,533 --> 02:28:12,611
I got it!
I am getting this bomb out of here!

2361
02:28:12,636 --> 02:28:13,586
Give me the gun.

2362
02:28:14,887 --> 02:28:16,973
It's you and me now!

2363
02:28:23,003 --> 02:28:24,353
Look, Optimus is out there all alone.

2364
02:28:24,378 --> 02:28:25,833
What? You can't help him.

2365
02:28:25,858 --> 02:28:27,315
I have to, Tess. He came back for us.

2366
02:28:27,386 --> 02:28:28,565
Dad, don't leave, please.

2367
02:28:28,651 --> 02:28:30,152
Look, I will find you, I will get there, ok?

2368
02:28:30,319 --> 02:28:31,571
Dad, no, you will die!

2369
02:28:31,654 --> 02:28:33,539
You got to stay with Shane.
You are gonna be ok.

2370
02:28:33,614 --> 02:28:34,914
You promise me
you are gonna keep her safe,

2371
02:28:34,953 --> 02:28:37,117
rest of her life, until the end of time!
Promise me!

2372
02:28:37,159 --> 02:28:38,536
I promise you.

2373
02:28:39,080 --> 02:28:40,498
You are the best thing I ever made, Tess.

2374
02:28:40,555 --> 02:28:42,333
Alright, don't ever forget it,
it was always you.

2375
02:28:42,540 --> 02:28:44,169
I love you.
Please.

2376
02:28:44,584 --> 02:28:45,876
Get in the car, now.

2377
02:28:46,085 --> 02:28:47,253
Dad!

2378
02:28:56,887 --> 02:28:58,723
Prime!

2379
02:29:24,915 --> 02:29:26,375
Stop the car!

2380
02:29:27,293 --> 02:29:29,394
You better listen.
No, you listen.

2381
02:29:30,546 --> 02:29:32,423
I am not leaving my dad.

2382
02:29:44,226 --> 02:29:46,132
Alright, we are gonna hold the line,

2383
02:29:46,156 --> 02:29:48,163
then block the bridge!

2384
02:30:16,676 --> 02:30:18,581
You see, it takes patience to make a man.

2385
02:30:18,928 --> 02:30:20,833
The patience to watch and wait,

2386
02:30:20,857 --> 02:30:22,390
to protect all of us quietly,

2387
02:30:22,473 --> 02:30:24,128
for God and country,

2388
02:30:24,152 --> 02:30:25,676
without any recognition at all!

2389
02:30:30,871 --> 02:30:31,872
Cade!

2390
02:30:32,024 --> 02:30:33,596
There are no good aliens!

2391
02:30:33,620 --> 02:30:35,695
Or bad aliens Yeager.

2392
02:30:36,170 --> 02:30:38,274
It's just us and them.

2393
02:30:38,739 --> 02:30:40,266
And you chose them.

2394
02:30:46,671 --> 02:30:47,672
Anytime.

2395
02:30:58,968 --> 02:31:02,428
You saved the human instead
of saving yourself?

2396
02:31:02,453 --> 02:31:05,225
You bring shame upon us all.

2397
02:31:20,072 --> 02:31:22,158
She never listens. Never.

2398
02:31:25,327 --> 02:31:27,496
I gave you an order!

2399
02:31:41,260 --> 02:31:43,012
Get out of here, now!

2400
02:31:43,095 --> 02:31:44,265
Get in. Get in.

2401
02:31:44,680 --> 02:31:45,709
Hey, you!

2402
02:31:46,162 --> 02:31:47,015
Hey!

2403
02:31:48,601 --> 02:31:50,832
Cade, get out of here!

2404
02:31:50,856 --> 02:31:53,022
This is my fight!

2405
02:31:55,441 --> 02:31:57,054
It's my fight,

2406
02:31:57,921 --> 02:32:00,110
and you are all gonna die!

2407
02:32:08,954 --> 02:32:10,539
Go! Go!

2408
02:32:11,207 --> 02:32:12,545
Come on! Come on!

2409
02:32:18,714 --> 02:32:20,889
Yeah! Killer robot, my ass!

2410
02:32:38,984 --> 02:32:40,165
Come on.

2411
02:32:47,827 --> 02:32:49,444
Get away, all of you!

2412
02:32:49,679 --> 02:32:50,513
Cade!

2413
02:32:50,538 --> 02:32:52,414
Come on Tess. Come on Tess.
Come on Tess.

2414
02:33:00,734 --> 02:33:01,850
Drive!

2415
02:33:04,343 --> 02:33:06,762
You see my face, your life is done!

2416
02:33:06,971 --> 02:33:08,353
Come on, come on, come on!

2417
02:33:24,613 --> 02:33:25,845
Yeah!

2418
02:33:27,533 --> 02:33:29,869
Honor to the end.

2419
02:33:31,923 --> 02:33:33,174
You still happy we met?

2420
02:33:38,668 --> 02:33:39,669
Always.

2421
02:33:47,055 --> 02:33:48,056
Hurry!

2422
02:33:49,086 --> 02:33:52,096
Quickly!
I am setting off Lockdown's grenade!

2423
02:33:52,265 --> 02:33:53,266
Hold tight!

2424
02:34:09,575 --> 02:34:12,731
We shall meet again Prime,

2425
02:34:12,755 --> 02:34:15,410
for I am reborn.

2426
02:34:30,846 --> 02:34:32,848
Kind of nice being your hero for a change.

2427
02:34:34,183 --> 02:34:35,379
You always were.

2428
02:34:35,676 --> 02:34:36,958
All my life.

2429
02:34:38,288 --> 02:34:39,289
I love you.

2430
02:34:40,560 --> 02:34:41,750
I love you too.

2431
02:34:42,858 --> 02:34:44,234
Let's go home to graduation?

2432
02:34:45,402 --> 02:34:46,359
Yeah.

2433
02:34:47,029 --> 02:34:48,469
You are ok, kid.

2434
02:34:48,697 --> 02:34:50,018
Come here, you are alright.

2435
02:34:50,378 --> 02:34:51,525
You are alright.

2436
02:34:55,037 --> 02:34:56,626
We don't have a home, Dad.

2437
02:34:57,039 --> 02:34:58,248
It blew up.

2438
02:35:02,800 --> 02:35:04,632
I might be able to help you with that.

2439
02:35:10,928 --> 02:35:12,659
Brave warriors...

2440
02:35:13,472 --> 02:35:15,190
you are free!

2441
02:35:16,475 --> 02:35:18,894
I will ride with you anytime, Spike!

2442
02:35:38,330 --> 02:35:39,832
Did you miss me?

2443
02:35:40,582 --> 02:35:41,612
No.

2444
02:35:43,984 --> 02:35:46,617
This Seed belongs to our creators,

2445
02:35:47,105 --> 02:35:48,738
whoever they are.

2446
02:35:49,298 --> 02:35:51,676
There remains a price on my head.

2447
02:35:52,469 --> 02:35:55,305
I endanger you all if I stay.

2448
02:35:56,640 --> 02:35:57,919
I shall take it,

2449
02:35:57,943 --> 02:35:59,865
where it can never be found.

2450
02:36:01,562 --> 02:36:03,037
Will we ever see you again?

2451
02:36:03,498 --> 02:36:04,791
Cade Yeager,

2452
02:36:05,103 --> 02:36:06,841
I do not know.

2453
02:36:07,630 --> 02:36:10,098
But whenever you look to the stars,

2454
02:36:11,177 --> 02:36:12,863
think of one of them

2455
02:36:14,132 --> 02:36:15,723
as my soul.

2456
02:36:17,161 --> 02:36:19,997
Defend this family, Autobots,

2457
02:36:21,498 --> 02:36:23,667
as they have you.

2458
02:36:24,710 --> 02:36:26,176
Defend...

2459
02:36:27,437 --> 02:36:29,522
all they can be.
