1
00:00:16,017 --> 00:00:17,685
Hey, baby.

2
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:19,770
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:19,854 --> 00:00:21,731
Where have you been?
It's been days.

4
00:00:21,814 --> 00:00:24,859
Yeah. I've been handling business.
It's okay now, it's okay.

5
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:27,445
You said I had to hide,
you said we were in trouble...

6
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:30,364
You know, I think... I think I got it worked out.

7
00:00:30,448 --> 00:00:33,242
I think I have some good news.

8
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:36,579
Good news?

9
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:41,042
Stillwell. She's open to us going public.

10
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:43,211
Don't you lie to me.

11
00:00:43,294 --> 00:00:44,253
Hand on a Bible.

12
00:00:47,173 --> 00:00:50,092
Yeah. But, listen,

13
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:53,512
for us to go public,
you have to come clean with me.

14
00:00:53,596 --> 00:00:56,182
Like, I have to know
who you told about Compound V.

15
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:03,189
Hey, come on.

16
00:01:05,358 --> 00:01:08,027
This is you and me.

17
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,490
I mean, we're Bonnie and Clyde.

18
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:15,368
Ride or die, right?

19
00:01:18,037 --> 00:01:19,538
I...

20
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,000
Oh, shit.

21
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:29,590
I told these guys,

22
00:01:29,674 --> 00:01:33,261
you were running the V
down near the Noodle Palace.

23
00:01:33,344 --> 00:01:35,972
I'm so sorry, baby.

24
00:01:36,055 --> 00:01:37,974
I had to. I...

25
00:01:38,057 --> 00:01:39,892
Why?

26
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:43,062
What do they have on you?

27
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:48,150
I don't know their names,
but there was this British guy,

28
00:01:48,234 --> 00:01:50,903
dark hair, real smug asshole.

29
00:01:50,987 --> 00:01:53,781
Buzz cut French guy,
big black guy with a goatee,

30
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:55,449
and a skinny white kid.

31
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:57,868
I think they were all working together.

32
00:02:01,414 --> 00:02:04,542
- I'm so sorry, baby.
- Nah.

33
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:05,876
- I'm so sorry.
- No, it's okay.

34
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,045
- I fucked up so bad.
- It's all right.

35
00:02:09,547 --> 00:02:12,758
You know what I was thinking about
on my run over here?

36
00:02:14,427 --> 00:02:16,429
Our first date.

37
00:02:19,557 --> 00:02:23,477
Most first dates order, like, a scallop

38
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:25,980
and a bottle of water.

39
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,734
But you...

40
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:36,407
got a dark beer, a New York strip,

41
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,660
and chocolate chip cheesecake.

42
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:42,538
I remember thinking,

43
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:47,668
"Here's someone
who isn't afraid to be happy."

44
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:53,049
And I fell for you, right then and there.

45
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:58,596
I love you.

46
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,558
I love you, too.

47
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,865
Why?

48
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:42,264
Well?

49
00:03:42,348 --> 00:03:43,974
Heroin overdose.

50
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:49,855
I'm sorry to hear that.

51
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:51,690
And the V?

52
00:03:51,774 --> 00:03:54,693
- She told some guys about it.
- No, no.

53
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:55,736
I mean you.

54
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:02,576
Come on, A-Train.
You've been shooting it up for weeks.

55
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,370
You really think I wouldn't notice?

56
00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:07,456
I'm done, man.

57
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,333
Nah, I'm fucking... I'm fucking done.

58
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:11,168
- Cold turkey.
- Really?

59
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:12,545
Yeah.

60
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,382
- Good.
- Yeah.

61
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,428
You know,

62
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:23,389
you really screwed up, kiddo.

63
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:28,352
But you did the right thing coming to me,
and I'm proud of you.

64
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:32,440
Thanks, Homelander,
for giving me the chance.

65
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:35,609
I appreciate it.

66
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:40,197
Hey. Come on.

67
00:04:42,992 --> 00:04:44,493
I love you.

68
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:46,454
We're family.

69
00:04:48,456 --> 00:04:50,166
I'll always be
watching over you.

70
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:53,752
Always.

71
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:57,673
Attaboy.

72
00:04:57,756 --> 00:05:00,092
Oh, and the misplaced Asian girl?

73
00:05:00,176 --> 00:05:01,343
I'll find her.

74
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,306
Fuck.

75
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:22,072
Massage the bird with olive oil,

76
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:24,241
then a sprinkle of salt and pepper,

77
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:25,784
then I bake.

78
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,914
Basting every 20 minutes
to keep it from drying out

79
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:32,249
is very important.

80
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:37,963
Till it's crisp, but not too crunchy.

81
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:43,594
And voilà.

82
00:05:49,934 --> 00:05:52,728
I think you understand me.

83
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,480
It's in your eyes.

84
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,983
Can you speak?

85
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:02,571
Tell me what you know, mon coeur.

86
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:07,576
So we can find these fuckers
who did this to you,

87
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:10,663
so I can get you back home.

88
00:06:47,283 --> 00:06:49,702
I like this outfit.
You know, the other one had...

89
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:50,619
Oh, my God.

90
00:06:50,703 --> 00:06:53,956
The other one had kind of like a, you know,
a Nicki Minaj thing going on.

91
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:56,166
Oh, yeah, the other one sucks.

92
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,835
They're only letting me wear this one

93
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,504
because, apparently, it's family friendly.

94
00:07:02,715 --> 00:07:04,508
You know, I'm surprised you came.

95
00:07:04,592 --> 00:07:07,511
I seem to remember you inviting me.

96
00:07:07,595 --> 00:07:09,305
No, I mean, I'm glad you came.

97
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:11,515
You just... I don't know,

98
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,227
you don't really strike me as the religious type.

99
00:07:15,311 --> 00:07:18,856
Well, yeah, lapsed, but I served
my time in Sunday school.

100
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:23,152
- Hey, Starlight.
- Hi.

101
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:26,905
Okay, so, do you know everybody here,
or just, like, 99.9 percent?

102
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:28,616
No. My mom and I,

103
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:32,161
we would drive coast to coast
in her brown Honda Civic,

104
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:34,413
just doing the whole Christian Circuit thing.

105
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:37,416
You know, Power Fest, Capes for Christ,

106
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:39,084
Believe Expo.

107
00:07:40,044 --> 00:07:43,255
We wore the tyres off of that car.

108
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:45,924
These people are like family to me.

109
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:50,471
After everything that's happened,
it's actually...

110
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:54,224
it's really nice to see them again.

111
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:58,771
- Sweetheart.
- Mom! Hi.

112
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:00,773
- How was your flight?
- Oh, it was a nightmare.

113
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:02,691
We sat on the runway for 45 minutes,

114
00:08:02,775 --> 00:08:06,070
and then there was all the,
you know, Flight 37 stuff.

115
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:10,658
But a Xanax and a couple of pinot grigio later,
here I am.

116
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:13,744
Oh, hello. Do you want an autograph?

117
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,287
Honey, give him an autograph.

118
00:08:15,371 --> 00:08:16,955
Oh, no, no. We... I mean, I know her.

119
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,415
- I mean, I don't...
- Yeah.

120
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:19,833
We know each other. Yes.

121
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:21,585
- Yeah.
- Oh, do you work at Vought?

122
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:22,503
No. No, no, no.

123
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:24,713
Mom, this is Hughie.

124
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:27,841
He's a friend.

125
00:08:29,635 --> 00:08:31,553
- Hi.
- How nice.

126
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:33,847
Starlight. You hydrating?

127
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:38,560
- Hey, Donna. How was your flight?
- Oh, it was perfect...

128
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:40,938
You have that "Teen Roundtable"
in 15, are you ready?

129
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,565
Oh, she was born ready.
I should know, I was there.

130
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:44,900
Great.

131
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:48,737
Do you want to come?

132
00:08:48,821 --> 00:08:50,406
You know what? I'll let you go ahead.

133
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:52,825
Go roundtable those teens.

134
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:55,452
- We'll catch up later?
- Yeah, sure.

135
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:03,377
So, Jesus...

136
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,713
Jesus said, "Hey, bro.

137
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:08,173
Hey, bro, bring it in.

138
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:10,884
You shouldn't need proof.

139
00:09:12,136 --> 00:09:15,764
You should just believe because I say so,

140
00:09:15,848 --> 00:09:17,683
because you have

141
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,768
faith.

142
00:09:19,852 --> 00:09:22,271
People who have faith,

143
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:25,023
those are my peeps, y'all."
That's what Jesus said.

144
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:29,069
But I am gonna ask you one question...

145
00:09:29,153 --> 00:09:31,029
Two twats at every entrance,

146
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:34,283
armed to holy hell. In church.

147
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:36,994
Well, that's America for you, isn't it?

148
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:40,622
And God's watching from up above.
Right there.

149
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:42,332
Over there.

150
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:46,086
Yeah. Security's tighter
than a choir boy's asshole.

151
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:49,131
So let me ask you something:

152
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:53,051
Why can Jesus walk on water?

153
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:55,512
Why does Homelander fly?

154
00:09:56,513 --> 00:10:00,142
How about A-Train, why does he get to run
the way he runs?

155
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:13,238
Or how do I get to hold the whole world
in my loving embrace?

156
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:16,366
Why were we chosen?

157
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:19,661
Because of the Lord.

158
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:23,373
Because we were born with his power.

159
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:25,751
Because we believe!

160
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:31,298
Fifteen thousand dollars.

161
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:34,218
For an exclusive
VIP experience with Ezekiel.

162
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:35,844
Seriously?

163
00:10:35,928 --> 00:10:39,598
There's not an easier, cheaper way
for us to get to him?

164
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:43,894
We ain't getting to Ezekiel. You are.

165
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,729
- I am?
- Whoa, wait. What?

166
00:10:45,813 --> 00:10:49,274
Starlight's one of the headliners, right?
She'll get you in.

167
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:52,945
Look, we've only been on, like,
a date and a half, okay?

168
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:55,113
I can't just ask her for a Diamond Club Pass.

169
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:56,031
What's the matter?

170
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:58,867
Worried your fake Supe girlfriend's
gonna think you're using her?

171
00:10:58,951 --> 00:11:01,495
Okay, then what?

172
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:05,290
I go up to Ezekiel, "What's up with you
smuggling blue dope into Chinatown basements?"

173
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:08,168
Yeah, pretty much. Once you show him this.

174
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:11,213
Jesus.

175
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:15,133
This is from that club you took me to?

176
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:17,177
You remembered our first night.
I'm touched.

177
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:19,721
Why is this the first time
I'm hearing about this plan?

178
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:21,723
This kid needs to be trained up, Butcher.

179
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:24,142
Yeah. Yeah, what he said.

180
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:25,978
I don't know how to blackmail anybody.

181
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:28,730
Hughie, you've done a murder.

182
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:31,984
Comparatively speaking,
this will be a piece of cake.

183
00:11:35,988 --> 00:11:38,699
I know. I know.

184
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:40,659
We're here today

185
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:44,705
to remember the victims
of Trans-Oceanic Flight 37.

186
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:48,584
One hundred and twenty-three brave souls lost
in an instant,

187
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:51,169
in a senseless act of violence.

188
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:56,592
Carolyn Kozinsky,

189
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:58,886
a preschool teacher from Skokie.

190
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:01,805
Dr Julien Barro,

191
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:04,474
an esteemed French neurosurgeon.

192
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:12,482
Susan Lopez from Evanston

193
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:14,943
and her daughter Maya.

194
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:23,660
Samuel Brown, a teacher of physics

195
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:25,579
from Los Angeles.

196
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:31,585
We are all truly sorry for your loss.

197
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:37,257
Where'd you go?

198
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:40,552
The only thing I hate more
than blubbering people

199
00:12:40,636 --> 00:12:44,264
- are boring speeches.
- Right.

200
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:48,226
You remember that nutjob in Albany last year?

201
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:52,064
Killed his wife,
and he came out of the house

202
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:54,733
with a gun at his daughter's head.

203
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,109
Remember that?

204
00:12:56,193 --> 00:12:59,696
Cops pissing their pants,
didn't know what to do.

205
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:03,784
And then you... You...

206
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:05,827
You step up very calmly,

207
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:10,040
ask for the sergeant's Bic pen
and fling it

208
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,250
26 yards,

209
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:15,045
right into the asshole's eyeball.

210
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:19,299
- Dead shot, dead shooter.
- What's your point?

211
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:22,135
My point is that you took action.

212
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:25,722
That's what I love about you, Maeve.

213
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:31,645
Look, Maeve, nobody wanted

214
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:35,107
that airplane to go down the way it did,
of course not.

215
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,776
And now...

216
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:41,196
we got to make the best of it.

217
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,281
Otherwise...

218
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:48,537
Well, otherwise, it was all for nothing.

219
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:55,460
What did I tell you about boring speeches?

220
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,722
Mom, when did that happen?

221
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:09,307
What are you talking about?
That's always been there.

222
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,359
I know what you're all thinking,

223
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:23,071
"Holy mackerel, Starlight?
From the Seven? Here with us?"

224
00:14:23,155 --> 00:14:26,783
Well, I knew her when she was still
in pigtails and braces

225
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:29,244
and she'd sit right where you're sitting.

226
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:31,705
So don't be shy.
You ask what's on your mind.

227
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:34,124
Starlight is here for you.

228
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,043
Yeah?

229
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:39,171
I have this friend
from my soccer team, Sunji,

230
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:40,672
she's Hindu.

231
00:14:40,756 --> 00:14:44,468
I know it's kind of my responsibility, I guess,

232
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,636
to get her to accept Jesus,

233
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,222
but it feels weird to me.

234
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:53,018
Well, Jesus also says to love your neighbour.

235
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:55,729
But if you love your neighbour,

236
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:58,398
don't you want to save them
from damnation?

237
00:14:58,482 --> 00:15:00,150
You have to look at it as good news.

238
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:06,490
You have a chance to help your friend
find eternal life, right?

239
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,158
Oh, yes.

240
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,868
Have you ever had a boyfriend?

241
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:11,078
Well, yeah.

242
00:15:11,161 --> 00:15:13,747
Yeah, I was with Drummer Boy for a while,
for almost a year.

243
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,459
Yeah?

244
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:21,588
Did you have...

245
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,591
sex with him?

246
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:29,763
Well, I...

247
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:33,517
you know, I think,
I think everyone hopes

248
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,894
that their first is the one.

249
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:39,439
And... it's private, but...

250
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:45,862
I'm a virgin.

251
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:48,990
Yeah, I'm...

252
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:52,994
saving myself for my future husband.

253
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:55,705
See? Hebrews 13:4.

254
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:57,666
Let the bed be undefiled,

255
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:00,252
for God will judge the sexually immoral.

256
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:02,462
Okay.

257
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:05,048
I think we have time for a few more.

258
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:07,551
I'm not really sure what you're saying, son.

259
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:11,012
I'm saying if there is some geezer up there
with a big white beard,

260
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:13,056
he's a world heavyweight cunt.

261
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:17,144
- What?
- I'm sorry, did you just call God a C-word?

262
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:18,979
Yeah. He's got a hard-on for mass murder

263
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:21,064
and giving kids cancer,
and his big old answer

264
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:24,025
to the existential clusterfuck
that is humanity

265
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:26,027
is to nail his own bleeding son to a plank.

266
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,488
That is a cunt move.
Even you got to agree with me there.

267
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:29,739
- Hey, please.
- We should lob

268
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:31,867
a fucking nuke at him,
get it over and done with.

269
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:35,162
- You know what I'm saying?
- We're sorry, sir. We apologise. My man.

270
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:36,830
All right. Good talk. Think about it.

271
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:38,373
I'm here all day, all right?

272
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:40,250
You mind piping it down just a little bit?

273
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,710
I'm sorry. Didn't mean to offend

274
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:44,212
your inner black Baptist mom
shouting "Praise the Lord."

275
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:45,797
Fuck you, I'm Episcopalian.

276
00:16:45,881 --> 00:16:48,967
And there's nothing wrong
with having a little church up in you, you know?

277
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,928
Said the bishop to the nun.
What about you, Hughie?

278
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:53,763
You believe in God?

279
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:55,056
I mean, I don't know.

280
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,434
- What? Come off it.
- Yeah, I don't know.

281
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:00,103
I don't think it's Morgan Freeman up there
or anything,

282
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:02,063
but it can't all be random chaos.

283
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:05,442
So you think that what happened to Robin
was some kind of divine intervention?

284
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:07,360
Is that what you're saying?

285
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:13,783
Hang about. Hello?

286
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,410
So what were you supposed to say?

287
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:18,205
"Yes, I've had premarital sex, go nuts"?

288
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:21,875
Well, I'm pretty sure I wasn't
supposed to lie to them, Mom.

289
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,002
Oh, baby.

290
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:26,671
You're Starlight of the Seven.

291
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:29,883
Millions of kids are looking up to you now.

292
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,551
You're a shining light to them.

293
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:33,261
How am I supposed to live up to that?

294
00:17:33,345 --> 00:17:36,223
Because that's the way God made you.

295
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:39,100
You're a miracle. You're my miracle.

296
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:43,355
Hey... Hey, you two. How's it going?

297
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:45,690
You know what? I'll catch up.

298
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:48,526
- You sure?
- Don't worry, I'll be right there.

299
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:52,322
Keep an eye on the lad, all right?

300
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,783
Where the fuck are you going?

301
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:56,826
Just do it.

302
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:57,911
Yeah.

303
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:01,915
- You okay?
- Fine.

304
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:06,002
It's just... this place isn't what I remember.

305
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:09,422
Hey...

306
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,433
Hughie?

307
00:18:22,978 --> 00:18:24,312
Hey, can I ask you something?

308
00:18:24,396 --> 00:18:25,981
Anything.

309
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:29,776
Is there any way you could
hook me up with one of those

310
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,528
Diamond Club passes?

311
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,697
You know, to see Ezekiel?

312
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,283
I mean, I couldn't get one
unless I robbed a bank.

313
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:38,159
But... you know.

314
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:39,995
Ezekiel?

315
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:43,290
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

316
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:46,293
Confession time. My dad is,
like, Ezekiel's number one fan.

317
00:18:49,713 --> 00:18:51,256
So what do you think?

318
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,591
Pull a few strings, you know?

319
00:18:53,675 --> 00:18:54,926
Hook me up with some tickets?

320
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:00,348
Yeah, yeah.

321
00:19:00,432 --> 00:19:02,350
Sure, of course.

322
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:07,814
- It's the least I could do.
- Thank you.

323
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:18,992
Thanks, guys. How are you, girls?

324
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:21,036
Hey, pal, how are you? How are you?

325
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:23,121
Great, thanks for coming along.

326
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:24,622
- God bless you guys!
- Thanks!

327
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:27,459
God bless you one and all!

328
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:31,046
Take care now. Keep believing.

329
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:32,297
Grab Madelyn.

330
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,924
I need to talk to her about
these fucking talking points.

331
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:40,138
Ms Stillwell isn't here today.
I thought you knew that.

332
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:43,475
But I'm here to help you with anything,
I'll go through the talk...

333
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:48,355
Ashley?

334
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:53,610
Where is she?

335
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:06,122
What are you doing here?

336
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:07,499
Skipping work now?

337
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:10,168
I am taking Teddy to the paediatrician.

338
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:11,586
Maybe reschedule it.

339
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:14,172
I've already rescheduled three times.

340
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:15,715
What is the emergency?

341
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:17,300
My speech.

342
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:19,094
- Your speech?
- Yes. My speech.

343
00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:22,180
It reads like corporate fucking mayonnaise.

344
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:25,392
We're talking Believe here.
These are my people.

345
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:27,519
But you're not just talking to them.

346
00:20:27,602 --> 00:20:29,854
Every dove and Democrat in Congress

347
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:32,023
is going to be watching you on CNN.

348
00:20:32,107 --> 00:20:33,983
- You need to appear moderate.
- No.

349
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:36,194
- Humble.
- No!

350
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:38,321
There is an opportunity here.

351
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:41,408
People are scared.
They don't trust Washington

352
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:44,661
or the coastal elite,
and they hate foreigners.

353
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:49,624
What they want is a little
John Wayne frontier justice.

354
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:52,460
And that is what I do.

355
00:20:54,963 --> 00:21:00,176
Don't forget, it was me
that saved that Flight 37 thing.

356
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,429
I turned that into a win. For us.

357
00:21:02,512 --> 00:21:05,807
You're really gonna talk to me
about "saving" Flight 37?

358
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,393
Well, why wouldn't I?

359
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:12,063
Look, can I please just talk to you later?

360
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:13,940
The speech is perfect.

361
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:15,525
- Trust me.
- Trust you.

362
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,485
Okay. That's what you always say.

363
00:21:17,569 --> 00:21:20,238
You're not even fucking listening to me.
You're so full of shit!

364
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:21,906
You say you want my input,

365
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,408
but you don't.

366
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:24,993
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.

367
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:29,539
- And you never did.
- I do. Can we please just talk later?

368
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:33,751
Why? You gonna run off
and play "strong single mom"?

369
00:21:34,836 --> 00:21:36,504
Please...

370
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:39,632
That baby is an accessory.

371
00:21:42,427 --> 00:21:44,762
We need boundaries.

372
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:09,871
Hey, Billy.

373
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:13,458
Rachel.

374
00:22:18,713 --> 00:22:21,966
Just took a lovely little
stroll around St. John's.

375
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:25,553
And you'll never guess what I happened across.

376
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:29,724
Who told you?

377
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:32,310
Well, I'll tell you who didn't fucking tell me.

378
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:34,646
My own fucking sister-in-law.

379
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:36,523
Would you like some tea?

380
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:38,566
I got the English stuff.

381
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:44,447
When'd you do it?

382
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:46,616
Last Sunday.

383
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:48,409
We used your last name.

384
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:49,786
We said "beloved wife."

385
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:51,955
You buried an empty fucking coffin?

386
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:55,208
We didn't bury anything. Just a headstone.

387
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,585
Well, that's a sick fucking joke
then, isn't it?

388
00:22:57,669 --> 00:23:00,588
And you're wondering why we didn't tell you.

389
00:23:00,672 --> 00:23:02,507
Look...

390
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:05,009
my mom's getting old.

391
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:07,220
She just wants a place to talk to her daughter.

392
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:09,264
Yeah, well, she's talking to dirt, isn't she?

393
00:23:09,347 --> 00:23:11,516
- It's something.
- No.

394
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:13,226
It's fucking nothing.

395
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:15,937
It's nothing, because there's nothing
fucking down there.

396
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,565
And for all you know, Rebecca's
still out there somewhere,

397
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:20,149
and you put up a fucking headstone.

398
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:21,401
Stop!

399
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:23,945
You need to stop.

400
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:26,906
It has been eight years since
she's been missing.

401
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:31,077
The cops never found anything.
You never found anything.

402
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,580
She's not alive.

403
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:36,833
She got killed or she killed herself.

404
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,710
You watch your fucking mouth.

405
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:42,755
You're not the only one whose life was ruined.

406
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:46,134
She is my sister, and I love her.

407
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:47,176
But she's gone.

408
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,599
We need this to be over.

409
00:24:10,575 --> 00:24:11,826
Oh, Popclaw.

410
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:15,204
You got the right to remain silent, bitch.

411
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:18,333
I did not kill your partner.

412
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:20,877
And I did not kill Dr Robinson.

413
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,838
I wouldn't lie to you. I love you, baby.

414
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:26,466
Love is just another lie, Donovan.

415
00:24:27,717 --> 00:24:29,927
- You must think I'm stupid.
- No.

416
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,349
But as you can see,

417
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:37,685
I'm pretty sharp.

418
00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:40,855
Yeah, you've got talent.

419
00:24:46,611 --> 00:24:49,280
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

420
00:24:56,496 --> 00:24:59,707
Oh, yeah, say it.

421
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:03,002
You're a filthy pig
who likes to eat ass.

422
00:25:03,086 --> 00:25:05,129
I'm a filthy pig...
-

423
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,844
Hold up. Easy.

424
00:25:11,928 --> 00:25:14,597
Easy does it. We ain't here to hurt you.

425
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:17,558
Who are you?

426
00:25:30,113 --> 00:25:35,410
This guy's got 34 addresses
and at least a dozen aliases.

427
00:25:35,493 --> 00:25:38,287
So, who the hell is he?

428
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:40,373
Something we're running down on our own.

429
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:43,418
Since when do you guys run down stuff alone?

430
00:25:43,501 --> 00:25:44,544
- Trevor...
- Yeah?

431
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:46,003
Shut up.

432
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:56,889
- Excuse me.
- Hughie.

433
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:00,935
Right? You're Starlight's friend.
She got you in here.

434
00:26:01,018 --> 00:26:04,313
- Yeah.
- There you go.

435
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:06,983
Good to meet you, pal.

436
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:08,985
Good to meet you.

437
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:10,695
How do you know Starlight?

438
00:26:10,778 --> 00:26:14,532
You know, we met,
like, a few weeks ago, actually.

439
00:26:14,615 --> 00:26:16,784
- Really?
- Yeah.

440
00:26:16,868 --> 00:26:19,620
- And she got you in here?
- Yeah, I guess she did.

441
00:26:19,704 --> 00:26:21,581
Oh, this is a pricey ticket, Hughie.

442
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:25,543
You must be a special guy.

443
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:27,670
I... No. No, I'm not...

444
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:30,047
I just feel lucky to be here. Really.

445
00:26:30,131 --> 00:26:31,716
Ladies and gentlemen,

446
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:34,761
I would like to welcome you one and all.

447
00:26:34,844 --> 00:26:38,389
And I would very much like to
welcome... Homelander,

448
00:26:38,473 --> 00:26:39,390
our special guest.

449
00:26:46,147 --> 00:26:49,233
So, without further ado,

450
00:26:49,317 --> 00:26:51,110
if you would follow me.

451
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:57,658
Gather round, everybody.

452
00:26:57,742 --> 00:27:00,328
Now, as many of you may already know,

453
00:27:00,411 --> 00:27:05,291
Homelander is an ordained minister
in Samaritan's Embrace.

454
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:11,297
Together, we will be rebaptising you,
my most loyal followers.

455
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,719
Do you accept the Lord,
our Father, as your Saviour,

456
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:20,556
- and Jesus Christ his son?
- Yes, I do. Yes, I do.

457
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,228
Then I baptise you in the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

458
00:27:29,732 --> 00:27:31,275
Your sins have been purged.

459
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:32,902
Christ be with you.

460
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:39,116
On this blessed day,
you will be reborn a Christian.

461
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,828
You will be washed clean of all your sins.

462
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:50,378
Something wrong, Hughie?

463
00:27:51,379 --> 00:27:55,132
No. No, I'm totally comfortable.

464
00:27:55,216 --> 00:27:56,592
Why would you ask that?

465
00:27:56,676 --> 00:28:00,429
Well, your blood pressure's 150/90.
It's a bit high.

466
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:02,932
Yeah, sorry. Just...

467
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:04,183
I'm afraid of water.

468
00:28:06,269 --> 00:28:07,687
Don't panic.

469
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,564
I got you.

470
00:28:10,773 --> 00:28:13,734
Do you accept the Lord,
our Father, as your Saviour,

471
00:28:13,818 --> 00:28:16,279
and Jesus...

472
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:17,947
as his son?

473
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:22,118
Yes.

474
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:28,958
Then I baptise you in the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

475
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:48,686
God bless.

476
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:51,439
Thank you all once again
for allowing me to be a part

477
00:28:51,522 --> 00:28:53,065
of this beautiful occasion.

478
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:55,902
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Good night.

479
00:28:55,985 --> 00:28:57,486
See you, friend.

480
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:59,405
Thank you. Thank you for coming.

481
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:02,658
May the light of God shine in your lives.

482
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:07,788
Excuse me, sir.
May I speak with you just for a moment?

483
00:29:07,872 --> 00:29:10,708
- Sorry, son, I got a packed schedule.
- All right, I understand, sir,

484
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:12,543
but it's just, I need your guidance.

485
00:29:12,627 --> 00:29:14,045
I need Christ's guidance.

486
00:29:15,713 --> 00:29:17,298
What is it?

487
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:19,091
Just hold on... one second.

488
00:29:19,175 --> 00:29:20,593
Let me just show you something.

489
00:29:30,144 --> 00:29:31,979
What's wrong?

490
00:29:35,358 --> 00:29:36,359
You fucked me.

491
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:37,985
What?

492
00:29:38,069 --> 00:29:40,488
Yeah, in a private Supe club.

493
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:42,531
You know the one on East 29th?
Secret Lair.

494
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:44,200
Don't know it. Nope.

495
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:46,243
- There were three of us?
- You've got nothing...

496
00:29:46,327 --> 00:29:47,787
- Oiled up, and you...
- This...

497
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:50,414
wrapped your stretchy arms
around me, and it was

498
00:29:50,498 --> 00:29:55,044
so fucking hot, and...
your dick was so... perfect.

499
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:57,213
And long and... stretchy.

500
00:29:57,296 --> 00:30:00,508
And you... You played my butt like jazz.

501
00:30:00,591 --> 00:30:05,137
With poise and skill and...
willingness to improvise.

502
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:19,443
You come in here.

503
00:30:19,527 --> 00:30:20,903
You try to talk to me?

504
00:30:20,987 --> 00:30:23,364
Like this?

505
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:26,117
You are a filthy, filthy liar.

506
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,244
- You are unclean.
- I have a video.

507
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:29,745
- I have a video.
- What?

508
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:32,373
I have a video of the three of us...

509
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:33,791
sucking and fucking.

510
00:30:33,874 --> 00:30:35,876
And if you don't let me go,

511
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,503
my friend puts the video online.

512
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:38,838
Like that.

513
00:30:44,427 --> 00:30:46,053
What do you want? You want money?

514
00:30:46,137 --> 00:30:47,680
Are you here for money?

515
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:49,849
You ship boxes labelled as polio vaccine

516
00:30:49,932 --> 00:30:52,727
but they're not really polio vaccine, are they?

517
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:53,978
They're Compound V.

518
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:59,191
- Who the hell are you?
- I want to know everything about them.

519
00:30:59,275 --> 00:31:01,736
Okay? You tell me where they're going.

520
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:03,821
And you tell me how many boxes you ship.

521
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:04,947
No.

522
00:31:06,115 --> 00:31:07,575
No, they will destroy me.

523
00:31:07,658 --> 00:31:09,326
Who's "they"? Vought?

524
00:31:11,454 --> 00:31:13,414
Here's how this is gonna go.

525
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:15,332
You're gonna tell me,

526
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:17,543
or that video...

527
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:19,670
trends, number one on Twitter.

528
00:31:19,754 --> 00:31:21,255
Tonight.

529
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:23,049
And you're also gonna stop

530
00:31:23,132 --> 00:31:25,634
the fucking "pray the gay away" shit.

531
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:29,513
Anyway, it's your choice.

532
00:31:36,312 --> 00:31:37,188
Hello?

533
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:40,274
Hey, so that wasn't a piece of cake.

534
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:42,151
Hughie, that you? You all right?

535
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:44,361
Yeah. Yeah, it's me, sorry.

536
00:31:44,445 --> 00:31:46,906
I had to borrow a phone. Thanks again.

537
00:31:46,989 --> 00:31:47,990
I got baptised.

538
00:31:48,074 --> 00:31:50,493
Yeah. It's a long story.

539
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:53,162
Blackmailing somebody is not cake, okay?

540
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:57,124
It is weird, it's scary, you wind up
just saying shit.

541
00:31:57,208 --> 00:31:58,918
Did you get him to talk?
What'd he say?

542
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:01,504
Yeah, yeah. I mean, you know
that charity of his?

543
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:02,630
Samaritan's Embrace?

544
00:32:02,713 --> 00:32:04,006
- Right.
- All right.

545
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:06,801
So what they do is they take
boxes full of that stuff

546
00:32:06,884 --> 00:32:09,095
and they ship it to hospitals
all across the country.

547
00:32:09,178 --> 00:32:10,429
And apparently the latest one

548
00:32:10,513 --> 00:32:12,389
is going to the NICU at Mercer Hospital.

549
00:32:12,473 --> 00:32:14,850
It's... It's midtown, I think.

550
00:32:14,934 --> 00:32:17,520
You are a natural, kid.
You're like the fucking...

551
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:19,146
Rain Man of fucking people over.

552
00:32:20,314 --> 00:32:22,149
Not a compliment.

553
00:32:56,767 --> 00:32:59,436
- Hey!
- Cool your jets, guv.

554
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,647
It's not a hate crime.

555
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:05,943
M.M., all right?

556
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:09,905
Fucking brilliant.

557
00:33:09,989 --> 00:33:12,616
I'll meet you at the hospital
in half an hour.

558
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:15,828
Let's hear it for Jesus.

559
00:33:16,871 --> 00:33:18,289
Yes!

560
00:33:18,372 --> 00:33:21,667
One more for the guy upstairs!

561
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:25,504
Oh, I love you guys.
Let me tell you something.

562
00:33:25,588 --> 00:33:27,381
I am so thrilled to be here.

563
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:28,841
Truthfully. Are you?

564
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:31,552
- Yeah!
- Yeah?

565
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:34,513
A terrible tragedy befell our nation this week.

566
00:33:34,597 --> 00:33:35,931
Terrible.

567
00:33:36,015 --> 00:33:38,434
And let's not mince words about this.

568
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:43,355
We... were... attacked.

569
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:46,358
America was attacked.

570
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,361
Some people...

571
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:52,281
they want me to come out here

572
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:55,242
and speak empty platitudes to you all.

573
00:33:55,326 --> 00:33:58,078
A little bit of corporate talk.

574
00:33:58,162 --> 00:34:00,331
But I don't want to do that.

575
00:34:00,414 --> 00:34:01,665
I can't do that.

576
00:34:01,749 --> 00:34:02,917
You want to know why?

577
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,210
Why?

578
00:34:04,293 --> 00:34:08,088
Because I believe
that what God wants me to do

579
00:34:08,172 --> 00:34:10,966
is get on over there, find the filthy bastards

580
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:13,802
that masterminded this,
whatever cave they're in,

581
00:34:13,886 --> 00:34:17,640
and introduce them to a little thing
called God's judgement!

582
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:18,974
That's what I think!

583
00:34:21,352 --> 00:34:23,687
Sounds like the American thing to do!

584
00:34:23,771 --> 00:34:26,565
Sounds like the right thing to do.

585
00:34:26,649 --> 00:34:29,610
But no. No, no, no.

586
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:34,323
Apparently, I got to wait for Congress
to say it's okay.

587
00:34:35,783 --> 00:34:37,243
Right?

588
00:34:37,326 --> 00:34:41,163
I say I answer to a higher law.

589
00:34:41,247 --> 00:34:45,542
Wasn't I chosen to save you?

590
00:34:45,626 --> 00:34:48,420
Is it not my God-given purpose

591
00:34:48,504 --> 00:34:51,131
to protect the United States of America?

592
00:34:56,887 --> 00:35:00,432
Homelander! Homelander! Homelander!

593
00:35:00,516 --> 00:35:03,894
Psalm 58: 10!

594
00:35:03,978 --> 00:35:05,938
The righteous shall rejoice

595
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:08,315
when he sees the vengeance

596
00:35:08,399 --> 00:35:10,526
and he will bathe his feet

597
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:14,488
in the blood of the wicked.

598
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:18,575
Homelander!

599
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:22,037
Homelander! Homelander!

600
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,959
Motherfucker.

601
00:35:42,433 --> 00:35:43,851
Hey.

602
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:45,811
Maeve, what...?

603
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:52,818
- Sorry, what are you...?
- I was stopping a mugging nearby and I...

604
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:58,115
It's good to see you.

605
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:01,827
Can I come in?

606
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:06,040
Okay.

607
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,547
Where's Freckles?

608
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:17,384
Freckles died two years ago.

609
00:36:19,595 --> 00:36:21,597
Look, I'm kind of busy,

610
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,849
so, maybe give me a call,

611
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:25,434
call first, next time?

612
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:27,728
Elena, you don't have to be like this.

613
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:31,148
Well, you show up out of nowhere
asking about the goddamn cat, so...

614
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:37,029
- You've been drinking.
- No.

615
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:39,698
You're not going to meetings anymore.

616
00:36:39,782 --> 00:36:42,951
Listen... Water under the bridge.

617
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,666
I miss you.

618
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:52,086
You don't get to say that to me.

619
00:36:53,212 --> 00:36:54,296
Leave, please.

620
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:57,091
Elena, I haven't seen you in years.

621
00:36:57,174 --> 00:36:58,258
I mean...

622
00:36:58,342 --> 00:37:01,720
- wouldn't it be nice...?
- I see you every day.

623
00:37:01,804 --> 00:37:03,889
Every time I walk through Times Square

624
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:06,600
or turn on the fucking TV.

625
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:08,435
I'm out of your life.

626
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:09,770
You never left mine.

627
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:17,403
I'm sorry, okay? I'm really sorry.

628
00:37:17,486 --> 00:37:20,572
- I didn't mean...
- I don't want your apology, okay?

629
00:37:20,656 --> 00:37:22,950
I want you to get out.

630
00:37:23,033 --> 00:37:26,537
Okay? I want you to go back
to your ivory penthouse

631
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:29,456
where you can drink
and fuck whoever you want.

632
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:31,834
Go back to Homelander.

633
00:37:40,634 --> 00:37:42,803
I can't go back.

634
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:50,310
Maeve?

635
00:37:50,394 --> 00:37:51,937
It's too hard.

636
00:37:53,814 --> 00:37:56,608
- What happened?
- It's just too hard.

637
00:37:56,692 --> 00:37:59,194
Tell me what happened.

638
00:37:59,278 --> 00:38:01,822
I keep thinking about all...

639
00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:04,491
- All those people.
- It's okay. You'll figure it out.

640
00:38:04,575 --> 00:38:07,953
Okay? You'll figure it out.
You always know what to do.

641
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:10,247
You always know what to do, okay?

642
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:14,877
- I don't know. They don't...
- So just tell me what happened.

643
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,920
Tell me what happened.

644
00:38:22,176 --> 00:38:24,678
I don't know, Maeve, if this is...

645
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:26,430
- Come on.
- No. No, this is...

646
00:38:26,513 --> 00:38:30,976
You're obviously... No, I said stop it.

647
00:38:38,317 --> 00:38:40,569
All right, just...

648
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:43,238
Just talk to me.

649
00:38:44,323 --> 00:38:47,242
Okay? Just tell me what happened.

650
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:51,205
Yeah, this...

651
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:54,249
This was a mistake.

652
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:57,628
No, just talk to me. Just tell me what...

653
00:38:57,711 --> 00:38:59,129
If you...

654
00:39:13,936 --> 00:39:16,605
- Hello.
- They're coming. They're on to you, babe.

655
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:19,650
Black Noir was outside my apartment.

656
00:39:19,733 --> 00:39:21,693
What location?

657
00:39:21,777 --> 00:39:23,028
Which addresses do they have?

658
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:25,447
If they got to my place, all of them.

659
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:40,379
So, you want to pay me

660
00:39:40,462 --> 00:39:44,258
the professional courtesy and tell me
where the hell you disappeared to before?

661
00:39:44,341 --> 00:39:46,218
I just had to pop down to the shop.

662
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:50,097
I was running a bit low
on mind your own fucking business.

663
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:56,770
This better be good.

664
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:58,021
I'm burned.

665
00:39:58,105 --> 00:39:59,815
What? Fucking hell, Frenchie. How?

666
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:01,066
I don't know.

667
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:02,526
What about the rest of us?

668
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:05,195
Your concern for me is very sweet.

669
00:40:05,279 --> 00:40:06,947
Maybe, maybe not.

670
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,323
So far, they only seem to be

671
00:40:08,407 --> 00:40:10,909
hitting my places. I'm taking off.

672
00:40:10,993 --> 00:40:13,161
- What about the girl?
- Fucking leave her.

673
00:40:15,831 --> 00:40:17,332
God knows what they'll do to her.

674
00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:19,876
Supe-on-Supe violence
ain't our concern, mate.

675
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,961
Butcher.

676
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:22,963
I said fucking leave her.

677
00:40:26,133 --> 00:40:27,384
Burnt.

678
00:40:39,646 --> 00:40:43,859
It was the Heartland Beauties
"Luck of the Irish" pageant.

679
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:45,777
The lights went out on-stage

680
00:40:45,861 --> 00:40:48,864
and this one lit up the room
with the glow from her hands.

681
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:51,825
The show must go on.

682
00:40:51,908 --> 00:40:53,118
That's so sweet.

683
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:54,870
- Fifteen minutes, Starlight.
- I'm sorry.

684
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:57,539
Could you just give us one minute, please?

685
00:40:57,623 --> 00:40:59,791
Starlight will begin shortly.

686
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:01,627
Please go to the main stage.

687
00:41:03,712 --> 00:41:06,632
Mom, I can't do this.

688
00:41:06,715 --> 00:41:08,091
Are you sick? What's wrong?

689
00:41:08,175 --> 00:41:09,968
No, it just doesn't feel right.

690
00:41:10,052 --> 00:41:12,262
- What does that mean?
- Honestly...

691
00:41:12,346 --> 00:41:15,140
I really thought that being here
would feel like it used to,

692
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:16,642
but it doesn't.

693
00:41:16,725 --> 00:41:18,602
It's changed, or maybe I've changed.

694
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:20,187
But...

695
00:41:22,439 --> 00:41:26,652
Mom, these past few months...

696
00:41:31,698 --> 00:41:33,992
No, tell them I'm not going on.

697
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,037
Honey.

698
00:41:38,747 --> 00:41:41,166
I've waited 23 years for this.

699
00:41:42,292 --> 00:41:44,252
This isn't...

700
00:41:44,336 --> 00:41:45,587
This isn't about you.

701
00:41:45,671 --> 00:41:47,172
Isn't it?

702
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:49,591
I mean, I kept your secret,

703
00:41:49,675 --> 00:41:52,219
scrimped by selling houses,

704
00:41:52,302 --> 00:41:53,720
took you to all the Supe events.

705
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:57,808
Please.

706
00:41:57,891 --> 00:42:00,560
All my friends are gonna be watching on TV.

707
00:42:00,644 --> 00:42:02,354
Please.

708
00:42:09,111 --> 00:42:11,530
They're coming for me, mon coeur.

709
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:12,989
The Supes.

710
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:16,993
I've been ordered to leave you here
for them to find.

711
00:42:17,077 --> 00:42:18,745
And Monsieur Charcuter, you know,

712
00:42:18,829 --> 00:42:21,832
he knows I'll comply, that's how he sees me.

713
00:42:21,915 --> 00:42:23,875
Like this mad bastard,

714
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:26,461
only good for hurting or killing, you know?

715
00:42:26,545 --> 00:42:27,838
Like a gun, he takes me,

716
00:42:27,921 --> 00:42:30,674
points me in a direction and fires.

717
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:33,051
It's not who I am.

718
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:36,388
It's not who you are, either.

719
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:38,724
We're the same, you and I. Like eggs.

720
00:42:38,807 --> 00:42:42,185
Hard outside, soft inside...
Or pineapples, perhaps.

721
00:42:43,437 --> 00:42:46,064
Whatever those bastards
got planned for you,

722
00:42:46,148 --> 00:42:48,400
you don't deserve it, mon coeur.

723
00:43:34,696 --> 00:43:38,867
The Deep finds himself
in hot water following a hare-brained attempt

724
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:41,620
to free a dolphin from Oceanland.

725
00:43:41,703 --> 00:43:43,789
Insiders say when police tried to intercept

726
00:43:43,872 --> 00:43:48,126
the hijacked van, Deep lost control
of the vehicle and crashed,

727
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:51,004
catapulting the dolphin
through the front windshield

728
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:53,590
onto the road, where it was run over

729
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:57,010
- by an 18...
- Hello there, Believe Expo!

730
00:44:00,889 --> 00:44:05,352
I am so honoured to be here tonight.

731
00:44:05,435 --> 00:44:10,899
Did you know that my first public appearance
was right here on this very stage

732
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:14,236
with Ezekiel and the rest of the family?

733
00:44:20,367 --> 00:44:22,702
Today, I wanted to share with you

734
00:44:22,786 --> 00:44:25,872
how I accepted Christ...

735
00:44:25,956 --> 00:44:29,000
as my personal saviour.

736
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:36,299
How his way is the only way...

737
00:44:47,811 --> 00:44:49,896
Just...

738
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:52,274
Just please stop the music.

739
00:44:52,357 --> 00:44:54,109
Please stop.

740
00:44:57,988 --> 00:44:59,656
What are you doing?

741
00:45:02,242 --> 00:45:06,872
You want me to just suck it up
and do this for you?

742
00:45:09,291 --> 00:45:12,252
You have no idea what you're really asking.

743
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:17,549
You have no idea what I've been through.

744
00:45:24,264 --> 00:45:28,727
Every single word that I say up here,
I'm reading from a script.

745
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:31,062
I didn't write any of these words.

746
00:45:31,146 --> 00:45:33,189
I don't even know if I believe in them.

747
00:45:33,273 --> 00:45:38,695
I mean, I believe in God,
I love God so much, but...

748
00:45:38,778 --> 00:45:45,493
Honestly, it's...
It's just how goddamn certain

749
00:45:45,577 --> 00:45:47,329
everyone is around here.

750
00:45:47,412 --> 00:45:50,874
I mean, tickets start at, what, 170 bucks,

751
00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:54,544
so that these people can tell
you how to get in to heaven?

752
00:45:54,628 --> 00:45:57,797
How do they know?
How does anybody know?

753
00:45:57,881 --> 00:46:02,844
When the Bible was written,
life expectancy was 30 years old.

754
00:46:02,928 --> 00:46:06,598
I mean, I'm not so sure
you're supposed to take it literally.

755
00:46:06,681 --> 00:46:09,100
It also says that it's a sin to eat shrimp.

756
00:46:09,184 --> 00:46:12,312
What, if you're gay or if you're Gandhi,

757
00:46:12,395 --> 00:46:14,564
you're going to hell? I mean...

758
00:46:14,648 --> 00:46:16,858
And if you have sex before marriage,

759
00:46:16,942 --> 00:46:19,778
that's... That's not immoral.

760
00:46:19,861 --> 00:46:21,071
That's human.

761
00:46:22,781 --> 00:46:24,824
What's immoral

762
00:46:24,908 --> 00:46:28,870
is the guy who shoved his dick in my face.

763
00:46:31,373 --> 00:46:33,500
- Shit.
- Shit.

764
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:47,097
Here's the truth.

765
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:51,059
Anyone who tells you they know
the answers is lying.

766
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:52,936
And I know, I know,
I'm supposed to be

767
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:56,064
this hero-idol-symbol-whatever,

768
00:46:56,147 --> 00:46:59,818
but I don't know what the hell I'm doing.

769
00:47:01,528 --> 00:47:05,365
I'm just as scared and confused
as the rest of you.

770
00:47:06,783 --> 00:47:09,035
I'm done pretending,

771
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:12,539
and I'm done taking any more shit.

772
00:47:18,878 --> 00:47:20,672
Thank you.

773
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:31,933
Excuse me.

774
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,407
Jackpot.

775
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:51,244
Compound V? Oh, yeah, and lots of it.

776
00:47:54,414 --> 00:47:56,666
Oh, my God.

777
00:47:59,753 --> 00:48:01,254
Jesus.

778
00:48:02,338 --> 00:48:04,007
That's a fucking baby Supe.

779
00:48:09,888 --> 00:48:12,223
Chosen by God, my ass.

780
00:48:12,307 --> 00:48:14,976
These cunts are made in a fucking lab.

781
00:48:21,608 --> 00:48:23,318
Hey.

782
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:24,903
Hey, easy.

783
00:48:25,904 --> 00:48:28,114
That was a great speech.

784
00:48:29,282 --> 00:48:33,703
I mean, come on... I mean,
know your audience, but that was, like,

785
00:48:33,787 --> 00:48:35,455
That was Joel at the Garden. That was...

786
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:39,000
I am so glad you enjoyed it.

787
00:48:39,084 --> 00:48:43,463
I'm so glad.
How was your quality time with Ezekiel?

788
00:48:43,546 --> 00:48:46,299
Any more VIP tickets I can get for you?

789
00:48:46,382 --> 00:48:49,552
Because I'm so here for you.

790
00:48:49,636 --> 00:48:51,304
- It's not like that.
- You sure?

791
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:53,556
Because I can get you a commemorative cup.

792
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:56,434
Or I can get you an Ezekiel figurine,

793
00:48:56,518 --> 00:48:58,895
- or a goodie bag.
- My girlfriend died.

794
00:49:02,232 --> 00:49:03,274
What?

795
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,112
Happened not too long ago,
and I came here looking for a way

796
00:49:07,195 --> 00:49:09,322
to get out of the shit that I'm in right now.

797
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:13,326
And that wasn't fair to you,
and I'm so sorry.

798
00:49:19,374 --> 00:49:24,129
I really don't think there's anything
that can help it anymore or fix it...

799
00:49:25,547 --> 00:49:27,465
or make it better.

800
00:49:29,968 --> 00:49:31,970
And everything I heard here?

801
00:49:33,429 --> 00:49:35,932
Well, that helped a total of jack shit.

802
00:49:39,769 --> 00:49:41,146
Except for what you said.

803
00:49:41,229 --> 00:49:44,065
I mean, you're right, there's... Nobody knows.

804
00:49:45,525 --> 00:49:49,821
And that's the only fucking thing I've
heard all day that's made any sense at all.

805
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:53,658
And that is the God's honest truth.

806
00:50:06,045 --> 00:50:08,006
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no, no.

807
00:50:08,089 --> 00:50:09,757
I'm sorry.

808
00:50:28,568 --> 00:50:31,654
Okay, easy with that.
You get some air in there, you could kill the kid.

809
00:50:31,738 --> 00:50:34,657
Well, wouldn't that be a crying shame?

810
00:50:34,741 --> 00:50:36,659
All right.

811
00:50:36,743 --> 00:50:38,328
Let's bugger off.

812
00:50:38,411 --> 00:50:39,954
All right.

813
00:50:41,623 --> 00:50:42,999
Hey!

814
00:50:51,216 --> 00:50:53,676
Hey, keep them busy.

815
00:51:02,435 --> 00:51:04,854
Watch and learn, son.

816
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,619
Hey. Hey.

817
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:26,084
Holy fuck.

818
00:51:26,167 --> 00:51:28,127
That was diabolical.

819
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:33,299
You little fucking beauty.

820
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:41,641
You done good, lad.

821
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:45,144
- Come on, Butcher, it's time to go.
- Yeah.

822
00:51:47,855 --> 00:51:50,275
Now, you keep your nose clean, sunshine,

823
00:51:50,358 --> 00:51:52,318
or I'll come back and stomp you.

824
00:51:54,904 --> 00:51:58,241
Holy smokes, Starlight shocking
the Christian community

825
00:51:58,324 --> 00:52:00,576
during her address at Believe Expo,

826
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:02,954
when she questioned her faith in...

827
00:52:11,921 --> 00:52:13,256
I see you.

828
00:52:15,091 --> 00:52:17,010
I know you're watching me.

829
00:52:17,093 --> 00:52:19,595
You've been out there quite a lot lately.

830
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,890
Always watching.

831
00:52:23,933 --> 00:52:27,061
So why don't you just come on inside?

832
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:29,731
You afraid of me?

833
00:52:40,325 --> 00:52:41,326
Come in.

834
00:52:52,837 --> 00:52:55,631
Have I not been paying
enough attention to you?

835
00:52:56,924 --> 00:52:59,052
Are you lonely?

836
00:52:59,135 --> 00:53:03,056
It must be hard, feeling so alone.

837
00:53:05,808 --> 00:53:07,477
I'm sorry...

838
00:53:09,771 --> 00:53:14,609
but you cannot give a speech like that.

839
00:53:15,943 --> 00:53:17,904
You cannot be bad.

840
00:53:49,227 --> 00:53:50,311
Come here.

841
00:54:17,713 --> 00:54:20,216
You have to be good.

842
00:54:20,299 --> 00:54:22,677
And you have to listen to me.

843
00:54:23,678 --> 00:54:26,973
And then we both can get what we want.

844
00:54:37,442 --> 00:54:38,901
That's good.

845
00:54:43,573 --> 00:54:45,616
You're my good boy.

846
00:56:53,828 --> 00:56:56,122
No, no, no.

847
00:57:54,305 --> 00:57:55,431
A miracle.

848
00:57:58,476 --> 00:58:00,436
You are a miracle.
