1
00:00:03,056 --> 00:00:05,726
(Ominous music)

2
00:01:11,425 --> 00:01:13,494
(buzzer)

3
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:21,668
Hey, it's Jeff and Joanna.

4
00:01:21,669 --> 00:01:23,536
We're here for the sublet.

5
00:01:23,537 --> 00:01:25,639
(buzzer)

6
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,647
How are you doing?

7
00:01:34,648 --> 00:01:35,648
(baby cooing)

8
00:01:35,649 --> 00:01:38,151
(door creaks)

9
00:01:41,989 --> 00:01:42,823
Hello?

10
00:01:46,694 --> 00:01:47,528
Hello?

11
00:01:48,596 --> 00:01:49,430
Wow.

12
00:01:53,501 --> 00:01:54,967
Left a note.

13
00:01:54,968 --> 00:01:58,004
(baby cooing)

14
00:01:58,005 --> 00:01:59,572
Whoa.

15
00:01:59,573 --> 00:02:02,108
What's all this stuff?

16
00:02:02,109 --> 00:02:03,711
That's interesting.

17
00:02:04,678 --> 00:02:07,614
You will find the key inside the fifth
drawer of the bedroom dresser.

18
00:02:07,615 --> 00:02:09,716
After you've decide this is not
a place for you to stay,

19
00:02:09,717 --> 00:02:13,352
then please shut the door behind you
and leave the building immediately.

20
00:02:13,353 --> 00:02:14,187
Thank you.

21
00:02:15,456 --> 00:02:16,456
Well that's a weird note, isn't it baby.

22
00:02:16,457 --> 00:02:17,290
Yeah.

23
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,629
Let's go see what's over here.

24
00:02:23,831 --> 00:02:25,265
Oh, look at this.

25
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:27,767
Oh, it's a decent size.

26
00:02:27,768 --> 00:02:28,868
It's good.

27
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:29,902
Yeah.

28
00:02:29,903 --> 00:02:31,138
What's in here?

29
00:02:33,441 --> 00:02:34,474
It's locked.

30
00:02:34,475 --> 00:02:36,375
What's in there?

31
00:02:36,376 --> 00:02:37,944
Must be where the owner keeps her stuff.

32
00:02:37,945 --> 00:02:40,781
We're not supposed to go in there.

33
00:02:41,949 --> 00:02:43,716
What's this?

34
00:02:43,717 --> 00:02:45,017
That's going to be your room.

35
00:02:45,018 --> 00:02:46,787
That maybe your room.

36
00:02:47,721 --> 00:02:49,056
It looks like...

37
00:02:53,861 --> 00:02:55,828
[Joanna] Wow.

38
00:02:55,829 --> 00:02:58,698
So what do you think of the place?

39
00:02:58,699 --> 00:03:01,333
I just had de ja vu.

40
00:03:01,334 --> 00:03:03,269
That's a good thing.

41
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,237
Yeah, it's a good thing.

42
00:03:05,238 --> 00:03:06,339
I don't know.

43
00:03:10,343 --> 00:03:11,678
I guess it will do for now.

44
00:03:11,679 --> 00:03:12,780
Hey, munchkin.

45
00:03:13,847 --> 00:03:15,347
For now?

46
00:03:15,348 --> 00:03:17,550
Well, until you can buy us
a big house in Malibu

47
00:03:17,551 --> 00:03:20,152
and you become rich and famous.

48
00:03:20,153 --> 00:03:24,023
Til then, be a good dad,
go unpack the car.

49
00:03:24,024 --> 00:03:24,858
Alright.

50
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:27,260
You gonna miss me?

51
00:03:28,962 --> 00:03:30,162
I know.

52
00:03:30,163 --> 00:03:31,565
It's so exciting.

53
00:03:35,703 --> 00:03:38,371
(ominous music)

54
00:03:40,173 --> 00:03:43,010
(heavy breathing)

55
00:03:49,316 --> 00:03:52,419
Oh, we haven't done that in forever.

56
00:03:53,621 --> 00:03:55,822
Hasn't been that long.

57
00:03:55,823 --> 00:03:56,824
Oh my God.

58
00:03:58,158 --> 00:03:59,926
That was amazing.

59
00:03:59,927 --> 00:04:01,193
It was okay.

60
00:04:01,194 --> 00:04:02,662
What?

61
00:04:02,663 --> 00:04:03,796
(laughter)

62
00:04:03,797 --> 00:04:05,565
I'm just kidding.

63
00:04:05,566 --> 00:04:06,667
You're right.

64
00:04:07,935 --> 00:04:10,837
You're right, it was good.

65
00:04:10,838 --> 00:04:13,673
(creaking)

66
00:04:13,674 --> 00:04:15,241
Did you hear that?

67
00:04:15,242 --> 00:04:16,076
What?

68
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:20,046
Sounded like
a rocking chair or something.

69
00:04:20,047 --> 00:04:21,648
Rocking chair?

70
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:22,782
It's probably just the neighbors.

71
00:04:22,783 --> 00:04:24,416
Yeah.

72
00:04:24,417 --> 00:04:28,220
Hey, wish me luck tomorrow, will you?

73
00:04:28,221 --> 00:04:30,623
You don't need it.

74
00:04:30,624 --> 00:04:31,625
You think?

75
00:04:33,827 --> 00:04:34,662
I know.

76
00:04:37,364 --> 00:04:39,432
I'd still like some though.

77
00:04:39,433 --> 00:04:40,267
Okay.

78
00:04:41,301 --> 00:04:42,135
Okay.

79
00:05:00,921 --> 00:05:03,491
(creepy music)

80
00:05:17,771 --> 00:05:20,007
(creaking)

81
00:05:32,653 --> 00:05:35,222
(creepy music)

82
00:06:14,728 --> 00:06:15,728
Hey.

83
00:06:15,729 --> 00:06:17,864
So, I had a great shoot.

84
00:06:17,865 --> 00:06:20,332
Shh, the baby's sleeping.

85
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:21,168
Right.

86
00:06:22,369 --> 00:06:23,570
The director thinks the role
could be recurring.

87
00:06:23,571 --> 00:06:24,704
No.

88
00:06:24,705 --> 00:06:25,705
Yeah.

89
00:06:25,706 --> 00:06:26,774
That's great.

90
00:06:29,042 --> 00:06:30,643
We have to stay in town all season.

91
00:06:30,644 --> 00:06:31,844
That's okay.

92
00:06:31,845 --> 00:06:33,746
I'm not back to work for a while, so.

93
00:06:33,747 --> 00:06:35,648
Yeah, there we go.

94
00:06:35,649 --> 00:06:37,149
Yeah.

95
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:38,451
My manager's booked me for
a bunch of meetings this week

96
00:06:38,452 --> 00:06:39,852
so I'm gonna be pretty unavailable.

97
00:06:39,853 --> 00:06:41,588
You going to be okay by yourself?

98
00:06:41,589 --> 00:06:42,955
Yeah.

99
00:06:42,956 --> 00:06:43,791
Of course.

100
00:06:48,896 --> 00:06:49,896
Love you.

101
00:06:49,897 --> 00:06:50,764
Love you.

102
00:06:58,906 --> 00:07:01,408
(piano plays)

103
00:07:04,111 --> 00:07:05,177
Hungry?

104
00:07:05,178 --> 00:07:06,013
Here.

105
00:07:08,816 --> 00:07:10,349
I went to the internet place today

106
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:14,187
but they said they couldn't
hook it up in this building.

107
00:07:18,025 --> 00:07:20,693
So yeah, the address isn't
even listed in their database,

108
00:07:20,694 --> 00:07:24,932
so they think that the wiring
is probably too old or something.

109
00:07:25,799 --> 00:07:26,634
Yeah.

110
00:07:29,302 --> 00:07:31,303
You're not even listening.

111
00:07:31,304 --> 00:07:32,372
Sorry what?

112
00:07:34,007 --> 00:07:35,775
What were you saying?

113
00:07:35,776 --> 00:07:36,809
It's okay.

114
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:38,377
You done?

115
00:07:38,378 --> 00:07:39,446
Yeah.

116
00:07:39,447 --> 00:07:40,280
Yeah.

117
00:07:45,285 --> 00:07:48,988
Sorry, I'm just really,
really nervous about tomorrow.

118
00:07:48,989 --> 00:07:49,990
It's fine.

119
00:07:51,191 --> 00:07:53,726
Look, if you want some help later on

120
00:07:53,727 --> 00:07:55,728
with your lines,
after the baby's asleep,

121
00:07:55,729 --> 00:07:57,564
I can work with you on it.

122
00:07:57,565 --> 00:07:58,965
Yeah, that would be good.

123
00:07:58,966 --> 00:07:59,800
Thanks.

124
00:08:23,524 --> 00:08:24,858
[Joanna] Jeff?

125
00:08:25,726 --> 00:08:28,395
(ominous music)

126
00:08:30,731 --> 00:08:32,131
Hello?

127
00:08:32,132 --> 00:08:32,966
Jeff?

128
00:08:41,174 --> 00:08:42,009
Jeff?

129
00:08:42,943 --> 00:08:45,613
(ominous music)

130
00:09:12,105 --> 00:09:14,542
(baby cries)

131
00:09:25,853 --> 00:09:26,687
Hello?

132
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:48,709
Hello?

133
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:53,113
Hello?

134
00:10:03,424 --> 00:10:04,857
Look at the camera.

135
00:10:04,858 --> 00:10:06,427
Alright here we go.

136
00:10:07,895 --> 00:10:09,396
Aw, that's cute.

137
00:10:28,882 --> 00:10:31,552
(knock on door)

138
00:10:45,165 --> 00:10:45,999
Hello?

139
00:10:47,501 --> 00:10:49,937
(baby cries)

140
00:10:56,444 --> 00:10:57,644
It's okay.

141
00:10:57,645 --> 00:10:58,879
I know, I know.

142
00:11:00,914 --> 00:11:02,949
Shh, it's okay.

143
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:03,784
Shh.

144
00:11:04,718 --> 00:11:06,886
(knock on door)

145
00:11:06,887 --> 00:11:09,489
(loud banging)

146
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:10,857
It's okay.

147
00:11:10,858 --> 00:11:13,292
Shh, are you hungry?

148
00:11:13,293 --> 00:11:15,963
(ominous music)

149
00:11:51,398 --> 00:11:52,232
Shh.

150
00:11:58,939 --> 00:12:01,609
(loud knocking)

151
00:12:14,422 --> 00:12:16,556
Do you like it in here?

152
00:12:16,557 --> 00:12:19,226
(ominous music)

153
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,070
Morning.

154
00:13:04,071 --> 00:13:05,638
Hey, I made you coffee.

155
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:06,974
Oh, thank you.

156
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:11,878
Is that sugar?

157
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:16,549
I think I'm gonna do those
thank you letters today.

158
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:19,553
There's some protein bars in here.

159
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:25,626
Jeff, look out the window.

160
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,660
What?

161
00:13:27,661 --> 00:13:29,897
Just look out the window.

162
00:13:34,067 --> 00:13:35,535
I don't see anything, okay.

163
00:13:35,536 --> 00:13:37,069
Jeff.

164
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,070
There's nothing there.

165
00:13:38,071 --> 00:13:39,071
I got to go.

166
00:13:39,072 --> 00:13:39,907
Bye.

167
00:13:41,675 --> 00:13:43,343
There was someone.

168
00:14:20,848 --> 00:14:21,682
Porter?

169
00:14:23,551 --> 00:14:24,384
Porter.

170
00:14:28,522 --> 00:14:30,958
What are you doing over here?

171
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:32,960
Hi.

172
00:14:34,061 --> 00:14:34,895
What?

173
00:14:36,964 --> 00:14:37,798
What?

174
00:14:39,032 --> 00:14:42,301
(baby cries)

175
00:14:42,302 --> 00:14:44,137
You want to go inside?

176
00:14:45,138 --> 00:14:46,706
Don't tell daddy.

177
00:14:46,707 --> 00:14:48,941
We're not supposed to be in here.

178
00:14:48,942 --> 00:14:51,545
(ominous music)

179
00:15:47,968 --> 00:15:50,670
They bang on the walls
as if there's something I can do

180
00:15:50,671 --> 00:15:52,972
to stop my baby from crying.

181
00:15:52,973 --> 00:15:55,575
But I never see anyone.

182
00:15:55,576 --> 00:15:57,478
Only hear them banging.

183
00:15:58,646 --> 00:16:02,349
I moved the nursery to the inner room,
in hopes of hiding the sound.

184
00:16:03,784 --> 00:16:05,785
George was upset that I did so
without asking him.

185
00:16:05,786 --> 00:16:11,624
The stress has been hard on him and
the baby keeps him awake at night.

186
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:15,094
He's in a fowl mood all the time.

187
00:16:15,095 --> 00:16:16,596
I have no one to talk to.

188
00:16:16,597 --> 00:16:17,798
I'm so lonely.

189
00:16:26,574 --> 00:16:27,940
[Jeff] Hey, babe.

190
00:16:27,941 --> 00:16:28,776
Hey.

191
00:16:31,945 --> 00:16:32,880
You got it.

192
00:16:34,247 --> 00:16:35,314
Yeah.

193
00:16:35,315 --> 00:16:37,283
But not only that.

194
00:16:37,284 --> 00:16:40,052
But the producer thinks I'd be
perfect for a role in a film

195
00:16:40,053 --> 00:16:41,554
he's doing with Debrowski.

196
00:16:41,555 --> 00:16:43,189
Is that good?

197
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,290
It's amazing.

198
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,493
Okay, that's good.

199
00:16:46,494 --> 00:16:47,994
The only thing is,

200
00:16:47,995 --> 00:16:50,430
there'd be a scheduling
conflict with the TV show.

201
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:52,565
I'd have to go to LA for six months.

202
00:16:52,566 --> 00:16:53,766
Would you do that?

203
00:16:53,767 --> 00:16:55,435
Yeah, of course.

204
00:16:55,436 --> 00:16:59,106
Give up a solid paycheck for
what's this thing pay?

205
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,608
Not much.

206
00:17:01,609 --> 00:17:03,042
But the chance to work with Debrowski.

207
00:17:03,043 --> 00:17:04,645
Can't pass that up.

208
00:17:07,414 --> 00:17:10,116
Oh, do we have room for three?

209
00:17:10,117 --> 00:17:10,951
Why?

210
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,953
I saw Alex on the way back.

211
00:17:13,954 --> 00:17:16,355
Alex as in your ex-girlfriend?

212
00:17:16,356 --> 00:17:17,190
Yeah.

213
00:17:18,391 --> 00:17:20,427
She's gonna help me run lines.

214
00:17:20,428 --> 00:17:21,861
She's coming over right now?

215
00:17:21,862 --> 00:17:23,262
Yeah.

216
00:17:23,263 --> 00:17:24,464
You have nothing to worry about.

217
00:17:24,465 --> 00:17:25,498
It's just business.

218
00:17:25,499 --> 00:17:27,867
I not worried Jeff.

219
00:17:27,868 --> 00:17:29,703
I just don't like her.

220
00:17:31,304 --> 00:17:32,472
Look at me.

221
00:17:32,473 --> 00:17:34,908
Can you give me some warning.

222
00:17:37,044 --> 00:17:38,745
I love you.

223
00:17:38,746 --> 00:17:39,580
Uh huh.

224
00:17:40,881 --> 00:17:41,881
Very much.

225
00:17:41,882 --> 00:17:43,349
You owe me.

226
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,684
Uh huh.

227
00:17:44,685 --> 00:17:45,519
I do.

228
00:17:47,187 --> 00:17:48,921
I have to go get ready.

229
00:17:48,922 --> 00:17:49,889
(knock on the door)

230
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:50,691
Why not.

231
00:17:54,995 --> 00:17:55,995
Hey, you're here.

232
00:17:55,996 --> 00:17:56,996
And so.

233
00:17:56,997 --> 00:17:59,198
You look great.

234
00:17:59,199 --> 00:18:00,434
Hello Joanne.

235
00:18:02,135 --> 00:18:02,970
Hi.

236
00:18:04,638 --> 00:18:06,873
Alex, it's been a while.

237
00:18:06,874 --> 00:18:08,140
Yes.

238
00:18:08,141 --> 00:18:09,308
I hardly ever get time to get back.

239
00:18:09,309 --> 00:18:11,444
My schedule is insane.

240
00:18:11,445 --> 00:18:15,147
(speaking foreign language)

241
00:18:15,148 --> 00:18:15,983
Pardon?

242
00:18:16,917 --> 00:18:18,317
(speaking foreign language)

243
00:18:18,318 --> 00:18:19,252
I forget.

244
00:18:20,153 --> 00:18:22,088
(speaking foreign language)

245
00:18:22,089 --> 00:18:24,090
Can I help you set the table?

246
00:18:24,091 --> 00:18:25,325
No, I'm fine.

247
00:18:26,494 --> 00:18:27,994
I just hope I made enough food.

248
00:18:27,995 --> 00:18:30,262
Jeff gave me no warning
that you were coming, so.

249
00:18:30,263 --> 00:18:31,498
Don't worry about it.

250
00:18:31,499 --> 00:18:34,568
I probably don't eat as much as you do.

251
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,842
I'm going to kill her.

252
00:18:43,376 --> 00:18:44,977
Joanne.

253
00:18:44,978 --> 00:18:48,648
Would you like to work out
with me while I'm in town?

254
00:18:48,649 --> 00:18:49,949
Well you seem to be in great shape Alex,

255
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:52,318
so you must spend all
your time at the gym.

256
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:53,886
I work out every day.

257
00:18:53,887 --> 00:18:56,155
Well with a baby, I never
seem to find the time.

258
00:18:56,156 --> 00:18:57,990
You have to make the time.

259
00:18:57,991 --> 00:19:00,994
I do and it can be very therapeutic.

260
00:19:05,165 --> 00:19:06,933
Ugh, is that lamb?

261
00:19:06,934 --> 00:19:07,934
Yes.

262
00:19:07,935 --> 00:19:09,068
I'm a vegetarian.

263
00:19:09,069 --> 00:19:10,671
For health reasons.

264
00:19:12,272 --> 00:19:15,442
But, politically I can't stand

265
00:19:15,443 --> 00:19:17,176
the thought of murdering animals.

266
00:19:17,177 --> 00:19:18,945
I'll have a salad.

267
00:19:18,946 --> 00:19:20,514
You eat salad, oui?

268
00:19:22,716 --> 00:19:24,617
Don't you guys have to run lines?

269
00:19:24,618 --> 00:19:26,152
Hey Joanne,

270
00:19:26,153 --> 00:19:28,455
did you ever get ahold of your family?

271
00:19:28,456 --> 00:19:29,289
Pardon?

272
00:19:31,258 --> 00:19:32,224
Oh not saying,

273
00:19:32,225 --> 00:19:33,926
I just, I over Jeff's agent

274
00:19:33,927 --> 00:19:36,529
telling him that
your family were phoning.

275
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:37,930
Yeah, shit, Morgan called.

276
00:19:37,931 --> 00:19:40,433
He wants to know why you
haven't called your sister yet.

277
00:19:40,434 --> 00:19:42,168
What do you mean?

278
00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:43,903
Well he said that she wants to know

279
00:19:43,904 --> 00:19:45,438
why you haven't phoned

280
00:19:45,439 --> 00:19:47,306
to you know, tell her you've
arrived safe and sound.

281
00:19:47,307 --> 00:19:49,075
Okay, well that's kind
of ridiculous because

282
00:19:49,076 --> 00:19:51,410
I just talked to her the other day,

283
00:19:51,411 --> 00:19:56,082
and you saw me phone my
mother when we got here.

284
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:59,152
Alright, I'm just the messenger babe,
don't worry about it.

285
00:20:00,153 --> 00:20:01,320
Oh, I'm sorry.

286
00:20:01,321 --> 00:20:03,856
Do you think that
you're smoking in here?

287
00:20:03,857 --> 00:20:05,024
Is that a problem?

288
00:20:05,025 --> 00:20:07,326
Yeah, we don't smoke around the baby.

289
00:20:07,327 --> 00:20:09,929
For health reasons, you know.

290
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:12,532
You can, go to the balcony,

291
00:20:12,533 --> 00:20:14,201
it's in the bedroom.

292
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:23,776
Please don't wake the baby.

293
00:20:23,777 --> 00:20:27,814
(speaking foreign language)

294
00:20:27,815 --> 00:20:29,782
She doesn't eat meat for health reasons

295
00:20:29,783 --> 00:20:31,951
but she smokes, are you kidding me?

296
00:20:31,952 --> 00:20:33,252
Come on.

297
00:20:33,253 --> 00:20:35,988
And you tell her to go our bedroom.

298
00:20:35,989 --> 00:20:37,289
Yeah, just give her a chance.

299
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:40,260
I don't need to give her a chance.

300
00:20:41,595 --> 00:20:43,563
Run your lines, get her out of here.

301
00:20:43,564 --> 00:20:44,564
I'm taking a bath

302
00:20:44,565 --> 00:20:46,298
and then I'm going to bed.

303
00:20:46,299 --> 00:20:47,134
Clean up.

304
00:20:48,201 --> 00:20:50,804
(ominous music)

305
00:22:27,668 --> 00:22:28,736
I pity you.

306
00:22:31,138 --> 00:22:33,306
(yelling)

307
00:23:11,078 --> 00:23:13,746
(phone rings)

308
00:23:13,747 --> 00:23:16,416
(ominous music)

309
00:23:57,925 --> 00:23:58,759
Jeff.

310
00:24:00,928 --> 00:24:02,095
Jeff, wake up.

311
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:25,919
(baby cooing)

312
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,895
What are you doing in here?

313
00:25:11,031 --> 00:25:11,965
Hey babe.

314
00:25:13,901 --> 00:25:15,134
I totally passed out last night.

315
00:25:15,135 --> 00:25:16,936
I don't remember anything.

316
00:25:16,937 --> 00:25:19,105
Drink too much?

317
00:25:19,106 --> 00:25:20,573
Breakfast.

318
00:25:20,574 --> 00:25:22,208
Breakfast.

319
00:25:22,209 --> 00:25:23,209
Sorry.

320
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:24,044
Sorry.

321
00:25:30,417 --> 00:25:34,422
Ugh, why do you keep
putting sugar in my coffee?

322
00:25:36,957 --> 00:25:38,224
I honestly don't know.

323
00:25:38,225 --> 00:25:39,759
It's not even ours.

324
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,695
Alright, I got to go.

325
00:25:45,398 --> 00:25:47,400
What, no kiss goodbye?

326
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:52,071
I'm sorry.

327
00:25:52,072 --> 00:25:52,873
Bye.

328
00:25:53,874 --> 00:25:54,974
Just stressed.

329
00:25:54,975 --> 00:25:55,976
These lines.

330
00:26:17,631 --> 00:26:18,566
Good job.

331
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,202
(baby cries)

332
00:26:26,073 --> 00:26:28,742
(ominous music)

333
00:27:21,795 --> 00:27:23,464
Don't go in there.

334
00:27:26,567 --> 00:27:27,400
My baby.

335
00:27:28,536 --> 00:27:29,369
My baby.

336
00:27:33,073 --> 00:27:34,307
I need my baby.

337
00:27:35,375 --> 00:27:36,209
Please.

338
00:27:51,258 --> 00:27:55,194
The routine of every day drives me mad.

339
00:27:55,195 --> 00:27:57,264
I spend my days cleaning.

340
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:00,099
George offers no help,

341
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,470
but I feel as though I have
somehow disappointed him.

342
00:28:03,471 --> 00:28:05,705
My daughter is the only joy in my life,

343
00:28:05,706 --> 00:28:08,475
but she screams throughout the night.

344
00:28:08,476 --> 00:28:10,477
I'm exhausted.

345
00:28:10,478 --> 00:28:14,413
With no sleep, I struggle
through my empty life in a daze.

346
00:28:14,414 --> 00:28:17,216
I feel such unease in this place.

347
00:28:17,217 --> 00:28:18,718
Even when I know I'm alone,

348
00:28:18,719 --> 00:28:19,852
I feel as though

349
00:28:19,853 --> 00:28:22,122
there is someone else here.

350
00:28:26,393 --> 00:28:29,062
(ominous music)

351
00:28:38,939 --> 00:28:39,939
Where's the baby?

352
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,942
In his crib, sleeping.

353
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:44,076
I was just there.

354
00:28:44,077 --> 00:28:45,345
He's not there.

355
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:53,386
Don't be mad.

356
00:29:05,533 --> 00:29:08,134
What the hell are you doing?

357
00:29:08,135 --> 00:29:09,401
Shhh.

358
00:29:09,402 --> 00:29:10,369
Why'd you put him in there?

359
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:11,604
That's the owner's room.

360
00:29:11,605 --> 00:29:14,206
We're not supposed to be in there.

361
00:29:14,207 --> 00:29:15,575
I know, okay.

362
00:29:15,576 --> 00:29:16,843
I don't know how it happened.

363
00:29:16,844 --> 00:29:19,378
The other day he just wouldn't stop
crying so I rocked him in that chair

364
00:29:19,379 --> 00:29:21,247
and he had the best nap ever.

365
00:29:21,248 --> 00:29:22,849
We're not supposed to be in there, okay.

366
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:25,051
It's also disgusting and musty

367
00:29:25,052 --> 00:29:26,886
and it can't be good for him at all.

368
00:29:26,887 --> 00:29:28,956
It's not that bad Jeff.

369
00:29:30,691 --> 00:29:33,225
And he likes it in there.

370
00:29:33,226 --> 00:29:34,226
He likes it in there?

371
00:29:34,227 --> 00:29:35,227
Yes.

372
00:29:35,228 --> 00:29:36,262
How could,

373
00:29:36,263 --> 00:29:37,329
Jeff.

374
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:39,031
Please can he just nap in there.

375
00:29:39,032 --> 00:29:41,601
It makes my day a lot easier.

376
00:29:41,602 --> 00:29:42,635
No.

377
00:29:42,636 --> 00:29:43,870
I'm locking it later on.

378
00:29:43,871 --> 00:29:46,707
It should have been locked before.

379
00:29:48,742 --> 00:29:50,410
How'd it go today?

380
00:29:51,311 --> 00:29:52,646
Well I got it.

381
00:29:53,714 --> 00:29:54,914
The TV show thing?

382
00:29:54,915 --> 00:29:56,115
The film.

383
00:29:56,116 --> 00:29:56,950
I got it.

384
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:00,887
What about the TV show?

385
00:30:00,888 --> 00:30:02,121
I don't know.

386
00:30:02,122 --> 00:30:05,626
Like, I'll know later
next week or something.

387
00:30:09,497 --> 00:30:10,330
He's up.

388
00:30:12,466 --> 00:30:13,466
Yeah.

389
00:30:13,467 --> 00:30:14,467
And do you hear that.

390
00:30:14,468 --> 00:30:16,402
He's not screaming.

391
00:30:16,403 --> 00:30:18,071
He's happy in there.

392
00:30:20,407 --> 00:30:22,141
Maybe that room is good
for something after all.

393
00:30:22,142 --> 00:30:23,375
Yeah, okay.

394
00:30:23,376 --> 00:30:24,644
If you think that we're having sex

395
00:30:24,645 --> 00:30:26,446
while our baby's in the other room
you better think again.

396
00:30:26,447 --> 00:30:28,148
Go change his diaper please.

397
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,496
Hopefully you hear about
that TV show by next week.

398
00:30:43,497 --> 00:30:47,066
I mean it would make everything perfect.

399
00:30:47,067 --> 00:30:49,836
If the schedules don't conflict.

400
00:30:49,837 --> 00:30:52,505
No, I think that you
should try to make it work.

401
00:30:52,506 --> 00:30:54,273
They're not gonna push for me, Jo.

402
00:30:54,274 --> 00:30:56,375
I mean that if you can take both jobs,

403
00:30:56,376 --> 00:30:58,378
I think that you should.

404
00:31:00,448 --> 00:31:02,414
You know it's not like
I'm making a lot of money

405
00:31:02,415 --> 00:31:04,216
on mat leave.

406
00:31:04,217 --> 00:31:06,853
What if we want to have another baby?

407
00:31:06,854 --> 00:31:08,855
[Jeff] Yeah, you're right.

408
00:31:08,856 --> 00:31:09,856
You're right.

409
00:31:09,857 --> 00:31:10,691
I just,

410
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:14,594
I really would like to

411
00:31:14,595 --> 00:31:16,128
find a more permanent place

412
00:31:16,129 --> 00:31:18,698
if we're going to stay here.

413
00:31:18,699 --> 00:31:20,567
(loud knock)

414
00:31:20,568 --> 00:31:22,234
What the hell was that?

415
00:31:22,235 --> 00:31:23,235
What?

416
00:31:23,236 --> 00:31:24,270
[Joanna] Didn't you hear that?

417
00:31:24,271 --> 00:31:25,371
No.

418
00:31:25,372 --> 00:31:27,941
This place is so creepy Jeff.

419
00:31:29,443 --> 00:31:31,377
You seriously want to find a new place?

420
00:31:31,378 --> 00:31:32,378
Yes.

421
00:31:32,379 --> 00:31:33,379
What if I have to go to LA?

422
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:35,147
What, without us?

423
00:31:35,148 --> 00:31:36,415
No, I want you.

424
00:31:36,416 --> 00:31:38,885
I just really want to
get the baby settled.

425
00:31:38,886 --> 00:31:40,553
And I hate this place.

426
00:31:40,554 --> 00:31:41,921
Did you move anything in here?

427
00:31:41,922 --> 00:31:42,756
No.

428
00:31:43,857 --> 00:31:45,793
Okay, I'm locking it.

429
00:31:49,963 --> 00:31:50,897
Hey, hey.

430
00:31:50,898 --> 00:31:51,732
Whoa.

431
00:31:53,133 --> 00:31:54,366
You seriously what to
find a new place already?

432
00:31:54,367 --> 00:31:58,138
I'm sorry, it's just
really lonely and weird.

433
00:32:00,007 --> 00:32:02,575
I mean I can smell people
cooking in the hallway.

434
00:32:02,576 --> 00:32:03,910
I can hear footsteps.

435
00:32:03,911 --> 00:32:06,078
I can hear people talking,

436
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:08,748
but I never see anyone.

437
00:32:08,749 --> 00:32:09,749
I don't know.

438
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:10,750
Go outside.

439
00:32:10,751 --> 00:32:11,751
Go for a walk.

440
00:32:11,752 --> 00:32:12,785
I do.

441
00:32:12,786 --> 00:32:14,053
Jesus Christ.

442
00:32:14,054 --> 00:32:14,987
I get enough stress in my life already.

443
00:32:14,988 --> 00:32:16,556
All I know is I'm stuck here

444
00:32:16,557 --> 00:32:19,025
all day while you're out with Alex.

445
00:32:19,026 --> 00:32:20,292
Oh this is what it's all about.

446
00:32:20,293 --> 00:32:21,561
No, it's not.

447
00:32:21,562 --> 00:32:22,895
Okay, I just had a baby.

448
00:32:22,896 --> 00:32:24,063
My career is on hold.

449
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:26,098
I feel fat and ugly.

450
00:32:26,099 --> 00:32:28,801
And you invite your ex
girlfriend over here

451
00:32:28,802 --> 00:32:30,738
without even asking me.

452
00:32:32,139 --> 00:32:33,139
Okay.

453
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:33,974
I'm sorry.

454
00:32:35,275 --> 00:32:38,077
All I wanted was a phone call.

455
00:32:38,078 --> 00:32:40,513
With some warning, that's it.

456
00:32:40,514 --> 00:32:42,114
Alright, I'll know for next time.

457
00:32:42,115 --> 00:32:43,149
Next time.

458
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:44,416
Yeah, okay.

459
00:32:44,417 --> 00:32:47,253
You think she's coming over again?

460
00:32:47,254 --> 00:32:49,288
Actually, she can't.

461
00:32:49,289 --> 00:32:50,824
She's gone missing.

462
00:32:53,494 --> 00:32:55,161
What do you mean missing?

463
00:32:55,162 --> 00:32:56,162
I don't know.

464
00:32:56,163 --> 00:32:57,296
What do you want me to say?

465
00:32:57,297 --> 00:32:58,297
She's missing.

466
00:32:58,298 --> 00:32:59,298
Are you serious?

467
00:32:59,299 --> 00:33:00,133
No.

468
00:33:01,168 --> 00:33:03,402
I don't think it's serious.

469
00:33:03,403 --> 00:33:05,805
She's probably just wondering
off with some producer.

470
00:33:05,806 --> 00:33:07,840
She does that sometimes.

471
00:33:07,841 --> 00:33:09,276
You're jealous.

472
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:12,278
I'm not jealous.

473
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:13,780
Well, doesn't surprise me.

474
00:33:13,781 --> 00:33:16,115
She's not that bright.

475
00:33:16,116 --> 00:33:17,850
Hey, can you call
your sister by the way?

476
00:33:17,851 --> 00:33:20,419
I talked to her yesterday.

477
00:33:20,421 --> 00:33:21,421
I don't know.

478
00:33:21,422 --> 00:33:23,623
My agent just keeps calling,
saying that she's calling

479
00:33:23,624 --> 00:33:24,991
and she doesn't know where you are.

480
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,258
Well I don't know what
you want me to do Jeff.

481
00:33:26,259 --> 00:33:29,462
I asked her and she said that
she's never called your agent ever.

482
00:33:29,463 --> 00:33:31,397
I don't know what you're talking about.

483
00:33:31,398 --> 00:33:32,432
I don't know okay.

484
00:33:32,433 --> 00:33:33,500
Listen.

485
00:33:33,501 --> 00:33:35,735
I don't want to argue anymore.

486
00:33:35,736 --> 00:33:36,936
It's my fault.

487
00:33:36,937 --> 00:33:38,070
I brought Alex over.

488
00:33:38,071 --> 00:33:39,371
I'm sorry.

489
00:33:39,372 --> 00:33:40,707
Okay, come here.

490
00:33:40,708 --> 00:33:41,974
I'm sorry.

491
00:33:41,975 --> 00:33:44,444
I know that I sound crazy

492
00:33:44,445 --> 00:33:46,646
when I say I want to move,

493
00:33:46,647 --> 00:33:47,680
but I,

494
00:33:47,681 --> 00:33:49,850
I don't feel at home here.

495
00:33:51,885 --> 00:33:54,554
Let's just pause that.

496
00:33:54,555 --> 00:33:58,090
Til we wait until we
hear about the TV thing.

497
00:33:58,091 --> 00:33:58,926
Okay?

498
00:33:59,993 --> 00:34:02,663
(ominous music)

499
00:34:28,055 --> 00:34:30,491
(baby cries)

500
00:35:03,657 --> 00:35:05,391
(glass breaks)

501
00:35:05,392 --> 00:35:07,828
(baby cries)

502
00:35:43,497 --> 00:35:46,398
(knock on door)

503
00:35:46,399 --> 00:35:48,068
One moment please.

504
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:52,673
(knock on door)

505
00:36:06,153 --> 00:36:06,987
Hi.

506
00:36:08,789 --> 00:36:12,058
You don't mind if we come in.

507
00:36:12,059 --> 00:36:13,393
Of course not.

508
00:36:15,463 --> 00:36:16,395
How can I help you?

509
00:36:16,396 --> 00:36:17,897
We just have a few questions

510
00:36:17,898 --> 00:36:20,533
about a missing person's case.

511
00:36:20,534 --> 00:36:21,768
Oh right, yeah.

512
00:36:21,769 --> 00:36:23,169
I don't know how much help I'll be,

513
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:24,370
but I'll certainly try.

514
00:36:24,371 --> 00:36:25,505
My baby's just sleeping,

515
00:36:25,506 --> 00:36:26,906
so if we could take it in here.

516
00:36:26,907 --> 00:36:28,274
Thank you.

517
00:36:28,275 --> 00:36:29,109
Uh huh.

518
00:36:30,544 --> 00:36:32,612
So you are aware there's
a missing person you said.

519
00:36:32,613 --> 00:36:33,880
How so?

520
00:36:33,881 --> 00:36:38,017
My fiance told me that
you had questioned him.

521
00:36:38,018 --> 00:36:42,189
We're here to discuss a
resident of this building.

522
00:36:46,293 --> 00:36:47,326
I'm sorry.

523
00:36:47,327 --> 00:36:49,662
Is Alex a resident here?

524
00:36:49,663 --> 00:36:51,030
I'm sorry?

525
00:36:51,031 --> 00:36:53,099
He said resident.

526
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,535
Yes, a woman named Joanna.

527
00:36:55,536 --> 00:36:57,638
Joanna, but I'm Joanna.

528
00:36:59,172 --> 00:37:03,343
You're Joanna Margaret,
married to Jeffrey Mitchell?

529
00:37:05,779 --> 00:37:07,114
We're engaged.

530
00:37:08,782 --> 00:37:11,451
But you have a child together.

531
00:37:11,452 --> 00:37:12,885
Yes, we do.

532
00:37:12,886 --> 00:37:14,854
Are you aware that you're missing?

533
00:37:14,855 --> 00:37:15,689
Missing?

534
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:18,225
I'm right here.

535
00:37:19,627 --> 00:37:22,028
You are aware that you
have a missing person's file?

536
00:37:22,029 --> 00:37:23,797
No, why would I be?

537
00:37:27,501 --> 00:37:29,902
Who phoned you to say
that I was missing?

538
00:37:29,903 --> 00:37:32,605
You have family that hasn't
heard from you in nearly a month.

539
00:37:32,606 --> 00:37:35,776
I just spoke to my sister yesterday.

540
00:37:38,011 --> 00:37:41,348
She looks nothing like the photograph.

541
00:37:42,683 --> 00:37:43,683
I'm sorry ma'am.

542
00:37:43,684 --> 00:37:45,452
It's just that you look nothing

543
00:37:45,453 --> 00:37:46,753
like the photo we have of you.

544
00:37:46,754 --> 00:37:48,354
Nothing at all.

545
00:37:48,355 --> 00:37:50,157
Can I see the photo?

546
00:37:58,799 --> 00:38:01,033
Okay, this isn't me.

547
00:38:01,034 --> 00:38:02,034
Isn't you?

548
00:38:02,035 --> 00:38:03,035
No.

549
00:38:03,036 --> 00:38:03,871
Clearly.

550
00:38:05,005 --> 00:38:06,973
That certainly would explain a lot.

551
00:38:06,974 --> 00:38:10,510
Do you not see how absurd this is?

552
00:38:10,511 --> 00:38:12,211
You know, we're gonna
need to see some ID.

553
00:38:12,212 --> 00:38:16,049
To make certain you are
who you think you are.

554
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,949
Look, I can't find my ID.

555
00:38:50,884 --> 00:38:53,486
(laughter)

556
00:38:53,487 --> 00:38:54,687
I thought that.

557
00:38:54,688 --> 00:38:56,123
Oh, look at this.

558
00:38:58,325 --> 00:38:59,426
(laughter)

559
00:38:59,427 --> 00:39:00,827
Can I help you?

560
00:39:00,828 --> 00:39:04,665
Oh, no, we have everything
we need, thank you.

561
00:39:06,567 --> 00:39:07,734
You can't just come in here

562
00:39:07,735 --> 00:39:09,569
and start going through
my private photos

563
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:11,237
without asking.

564
00:39:11,238 --> 00:39:12,505
Are these private?

565
00:39:12,506 --> 00:39:13,706
The book was on a shelf.

566
00:39:13,707 --> 00:39:14,707
Out in the open.

567
00:39:14,708 --> 00:39:15,808
For anyone to see.

568
00:39:15,809 --> 00:39:17,309
Okay, look.

569
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:18,377
I'm a lawyer.

570
00:39:18,378 --> 00:39:19,446
Which firm?

571
00:39:19,447 --> 00:39:21,080
I'm not practicing right now.

572
00:39:21,081 --> 00:39:22,715
Of course not.

573
00:39:22,716 --> 00:39:26,185
You can't just go into a
person's private belonging

574
00:39:26,186 --> 00:39:28,555
because they granted you
access to the premises

575
00:39:28,556 --> 00:39:32,459
for a case that is frankly ridiculous.

576
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,060
Ridiculous?

577
00:39:34,061 --> 00:39:35,995
You've come in here and told me

578
00:39:35,996 --> 00:39:37,096
that I'm missing,

579
00:39:37,097 --> 00:39:39,031
when I'm clearly right here.

580
00:39:39,032 --> 00:39:41,434
And now you're going through
my family's private affairs.

581
00:39:41,435 --> 00:39:43,002
It's illegal.

582
00:39:43,003 --> 00:39:45,237
And you'll be lucky if
I don't press charges.

583
00:39:45,238 --> 00:39:47,840
We'll come back another time.

584
00:39:47,841 --> 00:39:49,108
After you've calmed down.

585
00:39:49,109 --> 00:39:50,910
I've asked you to leave.

586
00:39:50,911 --> 00:39:54,146
Yeah, but we're gonna need this photo.

587
00:39:54,147 --> 00:39:55,414
For our case.

588
00:39:55,415 --> 00:39:56,416
What case?

589
00:39:57,518 --> 00:39:59,018
You found me.

590
00:39:59,019 --> 00:40:00,152
I'm right here.

591
00:40:00,153 --> 00:40:01,154
Case closed.

592
00:40:02,355 --> 00:40:03,423
Thank you.

593
00:40:03,424 --> 00:40:04,957
But we need this photograph.

594
00:40:04,958 --> 00:40:06,225
Why that photograph?

595
00:40:06,226 --> 00:40:07,394
Jeff is in it.

596
00:40:12,332 --> 00:40:13,166
Take it.

597
00:40:18,572 --> 00:40:21,708
(baby cries)

598
00:40:21,709 --> 00:40:24,545
You might want to check that baby.

599
00:40:39,259 --> 00:40:40,594
You know what.

600
00:40:42,162 --> 00:40:44,565
(baby cries)

601
00:40:51,572 --> 00:40:54,241
(ominous music)

602
00:41:16,997 --> 00:41:19,399
(baby cries)

603
00:41:23,303 --> 00:41:24,303
(loud knocking)

604
00:41:24,304 --> 00:41:25,672
It's okay, it's okay.

605
00:41:25,673 --> 00:41:28,341
(loud knocking)

606
00:41:38,686 --> 00:41:40,386
He never helps with the baby.

607
00:41:40,387 --> 00:41:42,855
We're nothing but a burden to him.

608
00:41:42,856 --> 00:41:46,594
I would leave but he
has hidden my documents.

609
00:41:48,929 --> 00:41:50,162
[Woman] He is abusive.

610
00:41:50,163 --> 00:41:52,766
And no longer the man I married.

611
00:41:54,101 --> 00:41:55,735
I'm certain that he has been sleeping

612
00:41:55,736 --> 00:41:57,770
with the neighbor girl.

613
00:41:57,771 --> 00:41:59,138
Although I have never seen her.

614
00:41:59,139 --> 00:42:00,474
I can hear them.

615
00:42:01,909 --> 00:42:03,142
I want to put a hole in
the wall and catch him,

616
00:42:03,143 --> 00:42:06,045
but I'm afraid of what I might do

617
00:42:06,046 --> 00:42:07,881
if I were to see them.

618
00:42:11,752 --> 00:42:12,586
Please.

619
00:42:22,162 --> 00:42:22,996
Hey.

620
00:42:24,532 --> 00:42:25,798
Didn't hear you come in.

621
00:42:25,799 --> 00:42:28,367
I just put Porter down.

622
00:42:28,368 --> 00:42:30,471
I didn't hear back yet.

623
00:42:32,573 --> 00:42:34,642
It must be killing you.

624
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:38,410
Well I feel like shit.

625
00:42:38,411 --> 00:42:41,682
I think I'm coming down with something.

626
00:42:43,584 --> 00:42:45,318
You feel a bit hot.

627
00:42:49,222 --> 00:42:51,357
The cops stopped by today.

628
00:42:51,358 --> 00:42:52,426
About Alex?

629
00:42:53,393 --> 00:42:54,227
No.

630
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:57,531
It was about...

631
00:42:59,833 --> 00:43:02,936
I don't even know how to say this so,

632
00:43:04,772 --> 00:43:06,238
there was this homeless woman

633
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:08,808
who wanted inside of our apartment.

634
00:43:08,809 --> 00:43:09,809
You didn't let her in did you?

635
00:43:09,810 --> 00:43:10,910
Of course not, but,

636
00:43:10,911 --> 00:43:13,345
when the cops were here,

637
00:43:13,346 --> 00:43:14,681
they showed me a picture,

638
00:43:14,682 --> 00:43:17,016
and I think it was her.

639
00:43:17,017 --> 00:43:18,985
Did you tell them you'd seen her?

640
00:43:18,986 --> 00:43:20,086
No.

641
00:43:20,087 --> 00:43:21,554
I didn't connect it at the time,

642
00:43:21,555 --> 00:43:24,691
because she looks a lot older now.

643
00:43:24,692 --> 00:43:27,960
We should probably phone them then.

644
00:43:27,961 --> 00:43:28,796
Yeah.

645
00:43:29,963 --> 00:43:32,231
But this is where it gets really weird.

646
00:43:32,232 --> 00:43:36,403
I think it's the woman
that we're subletting from.

647
00:43:39,507 --> 00:43:40,540
That's crazy.

648
00:43:40,541 --> 00:43:41,775
I know it is.

649
00:43:43,176 --> 00:43:44,110
Well how do you even
know what she looks like?

650
00:43:44,111 --> 00:43:46,714
From the pictures in the room.

651
00:43:47,881 --> 00:43:49,816
That probably just looks like her.

652
00:43:49,817 --> 00:43:51,652
No, I don't think so.

653
00:43:53,654 --> 00:43:56,255
Joanna, we're not subletting
from a missing woman.

654
00:43:56,256 --> 00:43:57,491
Think about it.

655
00:44:01,529 --> 00:44:03,129
They didn't say that she was missing.

656
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:05,533
They said that I was missing.

657
00:44:09,002 --> 00:44:11,037
You probably just misheard them.

658
00:44:11,038 --> 00:44:14,173
They made comments about my weight.

659
00:44:14,174 --> 00:44:16,375
Don't worry about that.

660
00:44:16,376 --> 00:44:17,844
You just had a kid.

661
00:44:17,845 --> 00:44:21,281
You'll be back to sexy
Joanna in no time.

662
00:44:23,984 --> 00:44:26,919
Well they made me feel really gross.

663
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,321
But I guess I am.

664
00:44:29,289 --> 00:44:30,289
I didn't mean it like that.

665
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:31,691
You're such an asshole.

666
00:44:31,692 --> 00:44:33,726
Where the hell is this coming from?

667
00:44:33,727 --> 00:44:35,294
I hope you're having fun with Alex

668
00:44:35,295 --> 00:44:38,130
while I'm stuck at
home raising your son.

669
00:44:38,131 --> 00:44:39,131
Joanna.

670
00:44:39,132 --> 00:44:40,600
I love you.

671
00:44:40,601 --> 00:44:41,769
Don't do this.

672
00:44:43,704 --> 00:44:47,040
I'll let you know when dinner's ready.

673
00:45:00,053 --> 00:45:02,990
Look I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.

674
00:45:05,926 --> 00:45:06,760
Joanna.

675
00:45:08,529 --> 00:45:09,362
Come on.

676
00:45:20,941 --> 00:45:22,943
Look I said I was sorry.

677
00:45:26,246 --> 00:45:27,080
Joanna.

678
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:32,119
Look I'm not gonna cheat on you.

679
00:45:33,186 --> 00:45:34,087
I love you.

680
00:45:35,222 --> 00:45:38,458
I've just been distracted lately.

681
00:45:38,459 --> 00:45:42,362
You're so certain about all that,
then why haven't we set a date?

682
00:45:43,831 --> 00:45:44,665
When?

683
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:53,673
Look I know, okay.

684
00:45:53,674 --> 00:45:54,842
I'm sorry too.

685
00:45:56,043 --> 00:45:57,910
I don't know why it bothered me so much.

686
00:45:57,911 --> 00:46:01,914
I, I could hear myself yelling at you,

687
00:46:01,915 --> 00:46:04,251
and it wasn't even sure why.

688
00:46:05,252 --> 00:46:07,488
I just feel so overwhelmed.

689
00:46:11,625 --> 00:46:13,561
What are you reading?

690
00:46:15,328 --> 00:46:17,797
It's a book I found in the apartment.

691
00:46:17,798 --> 00:46:19,098
I think it's someone's journal.

692
00:46:19,099 --> 00:46:20,933
Someone who lived here.

693
00:46:20,934 --> 00:46:23,302
Probably shouldn't be reading it.

694
00:46:23,303 --> 00:46:24,571
I know.

695
00:46:24,572 --> 00:46:25,973
But I can't stop.

696
00:46:29,677 --> 00:46:31,011
Anything good?

697
00:46:32,713 --> 00:46:35,515
Not in the way you mean.

698
00:46:35,516 --> 00:46:37,751
What do you think I mean?

699
00:46:41,154 --> 00:46:42,222
Jeff don't.

700
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:44,357
Oh, come on.

701
00:46:47,027 --> 00:46:48,227
It's been a while.

702
00:46:48,228 --> 00:46:50,129
Okay, seriously.

703
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:53,800
I'm trying to actually have
a conversation with you,

704
00:46:53,801 --> 00:46:56,737
and all you want to do is have sex.

705
00:46:58,271 --> 00:47:00,373
Is that all I'm good for?

706
00:47:11,318 --> 00:47:13,987
(ominous music)

707
00:47:28,869 --> 00:47:29,703
Jeff.

708
00:47:31,639 --> 00:47:34,975
(moaning in background)

709
00:47:38,111 --> 00:47:40,848
(dramatic music)

710
00:48:00,568 --> 00:48:02,235
Your baby is mine.

711
00:48:05,038 --> 00:48:07,708
(ominous music)

712
00:48:40,173 --> 00:48:41,008
Jeff.

713
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:44,044
Wake up.

714
00:48:45,312 --> 00:48:46,146
Wake up.

715
00:48:49,082 --> 00:48:50,049
What time is it?

716
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:51,017
It's early.

717
00:48:51,018 --> 00:48:52,920
Why was I on the couch?

718
00:48:55,255 --> 00:48:56,255
I don't know.

719
00:48:56,256 --> 00:48:57,925
I couldn't wake you.

720
00:48:58,859 --> 00:49:01,429
Who moved it across the room?

721
00:49:04,064 --> 00:49:04,898
You did.

722
00:49:06,867 --> 00:49:08,400
Why?

723
00:49:08,401 --> 00:49:10,236
I don't know.

724
00:49:10,237 --> 00:49:11,904
It's before we had sex.

725
00:49:11,905 --> 00:49:12,740
What?

726
00:49:14,575 --> 00:49:15,875
What?

727
00:49:15,876 --> 00:49:17,243
You don't remember.

728
00:49:17,244 --> 00:49:18,678
Don't touch me.

729
00:49:18,679 --> 00:49:19,912
What?

730
00:49:19,913 --> 00:49:21,581
You had sex with me while I was asleep.

731
00:49:21,582 --> 00:49:23,182
What's wrong with you.

732
00:49:23,183 --> 00:49:24,584
You weren't asleep.

733
00:49:24,585 --> 00:49:25,585
You initiated it.

734
00:49:25,586 --> 00:49:26,920
I was exhausted.

735
00:49:30,991 --> 00:49:32,925
I had a dream you cheated on me

736
00:49:32,926 --> 00:49:35,262
with the woman in the photo.

737
00:49:36,396 --> 00:49:38,065
With a dead woman?

738
00:49:39,066 --> 00:49:40,266
It's not funny.

739
00:49:40,267 --> 00:49:41,834
I'm mad.

740
00:49:41,835 --> 00:49:43,636
I didn't do anything.

741
00:49:43,637 --> 00:49:45,138
You need to relax.

742
00:49:46,039 --> 00:49:47,708
I don't feel good.

743
00:49:51,211 --> 00:49:54,481
I think you should take it easy today.

744
00:49:54,482 --> 00:49:55,883
Maybe go outside.

745
00:49:59,086 --> 00:50:01,922
(dramatic music)

746
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:17,805
Outside.

747
00:50:21,642 --> 00:50:24,545
Why are you still standing there?

748
00:50:29,349 --> 00:50:32,019
Have you not moved since I left?

749
00:50:32,886 --> 00:50:33,721
I.

750
00:50:43,831 --> 00:50:46,166
(baby coos)

751
00:50:57,611 --> 00:50:59,479
Who moved the couch?

752
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:00,914
[Jeff] You did.

753
00:51:43,824 --> 00:51:46,059
(knocking)

754
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:13,319
That's it.

755
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,155
I'll call the manager.

756
00:52:50,524 --> 00:52:51,825
[Woman] Hello.

757
00:52:53,927 --> 00:52:54,762
Hello.

758
00:52:56,430 --> 00:52:57,464
Hello?

759
00:52:57,465 --> 00:52:58,799
[Woman] Hello.

760
00:53:01,101 --> 00:53:02,702
Hello.

761
00:53:02,703 --> 00:53:04,070
(laughter)

762
00:53:04,071 --> 00:53:06,406
(dial tone)

763
00:53:15,549 --> 00:53:18,051
(phone rings)

764
00:54:11,605 --> 00:54:14,374
(dramatic music)

765
00:55:12,866 --> 00:55:14,201
[Woman] Hello.

766
00:55:26,013 --> 00:55:27,379
Hello.

767
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:28,716
[Woman] Hello.

768
00:55:30,884 --> 00:55:33,285
You're baby's mine.

769
00:55:33,286 --> 00:55:34,954
(baby cries)

770
00:55:34,955 --> 00:55:36,322
(dial tone)

771
00:55:36,323 --> 00:55:37,157
Porter.

772
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:41,294
(ominous music)

773
00:57:02,275 --> 00:57:03,777
What's the matter?

774
00:57:07,848 --> 00:57:09,816
TV thing's gonna work out.

775
00:57:09,817 --> 00:57:12,820
Okay, well that's great, isn't it?

776
00:57:14,955 --> 00:57:17,156
Schedule conflict?

777
00:57:17,157 --> 00:57:18,725
No, that was fixed.

778
00:57:18,726 --> 00:57:21,061
Well then congratulations.

779
00:57:23,497 --> 00:57:25,765
I lost the film role.

780
00:57:25,766 --> 00:57:26,966
Why?

781
00:57:26,967 --> 00:57:28,234
Someone called the producer

782
00:57:28,235 --> 00:57:31,370
and told them that I was an alcoholic
and I was difficult to work with.

783
00:57:31,371 --> 00:57:33,040
Who would do that?

784
00:57:36,777 --> 00:57:39,011
They said it was a woman.

785
00:57:39,012 --> 00:57:40,848
Are you accusing me?

786
00:57:43,717 --> 00:57:44,917
No.

787
00:57:44,918 --> 00:57:46,587
It sounds like it.

788
00:57:49,523 --> 00:57:51,123
Well who else would it be?

789
00:57:51,124 --> 00:57:52,358
Well I don't know.

790
00:57:52,359 --> 00:57:54,093
Maybe your friend, Alex.

791
00:57:54,094 --> 00:57:55,728
Alex tried to get me the
role in the first place.

792
00:57:55,729 --> 00:57:57,396
She's been on my side
since the beginning.

793
00:57:57,397 --> 00:57:59,132
And I haven't been?

794
00:58:06,339 --> 00:58:07,940
No, you.

795
00:58:07,941 --> 00:58:10,611
(loud knocking)

796
00:58:11,512 --> 00:58:13,680
How long has this been going on?

797
00:58:13,681 --> 00:58:15,749
Just happens sometimes.

798
00:58:16,650 --> 00:58:17,885
That's crazy.

799
00:58:18,819 --> 00:58:19,986
Hey.

800
00:58:19,987 --> 00:58:20,821
Shut up.

801
00:58:27,227 --> 00:58:30,797
I just don't understand why someone
called the producer like that.

802
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:33,866
(loud knocking)

803
00:58:33,867 --> 00:58:36,103
What the hell do they want?

804
00:58:38,305 --> 00:58:39,439
I don't like it here.

805
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:42,008
I feel like I'm going crazy.

806
00:58:42,009 --> 00:58:42,943
I'll say.

807
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:46,480
I mean here in this apartment.

808
00:58:53,554 --> 00:58:54,387
Shut up.

809
00:59:08,669 --> 00:59:11,171
Are you going to be alright?

810
00:59:12,272 --> 00:59:15,375
Really sorry you didn't get that role.

811
00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:18,311
It's late.

812
00:59:19,713 --> 00:59:22,049
I think my agent can fix it.

813
00:59:23,216 --> 00:59:25,819
I'm just gonna go get some sleep.

814
00:59:27,655 --> 00:59:29,255
You look sick.

815
00:59:29,256 --> 00:59:30,758
I feel terrible.

816
00:59:34,928 --> 00:59:36,996
You gonna come?

817
00:59:36,997 --> 00:59:37,831
No.

818
00:59:39,032 --> 00:59:42,334
I'm going to stay up and read a bit.

819
00:59:42,335 --> 00:59:43,803
Okay.

820
00:59:43,804 --> 00:59:45,404
What's this?

821
00:59:45,405 --> 00:59:46,239
Hmm?

822
00:59:47,975 --> 00:59:50,009
This blanket.

823
00:59:50,010 --> 00:59:52,746
(dramatic music)

824
01:00:03,757 --> 01:00:04,757
Morgan just called.

825
01:00:04,758 --> 01:00:05,958
What?

826
01:00:05,959 --> 01:00:09,530
There's still a chance
I can get this part.

827
01:00:18,839 --> 01:00:20,339
[Joanna] I can't take it anymore.

828
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:22,609
George won't even speak to me.

829
01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:24,577
He just yells.

830
01:00:24,578 --> 01:00:26,479
He blames me for the death of our baby.

831
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:28,148
But it is his fault.

832
01:00:29,149 --> 01:00:31,083
His fault I had to run next door

833
01:00:31,084 --> 01:00:32,752
because of his affair.

834
01:00:32,753 --> 01:00:34,454
His fault I had to leave her alone.

835
01:00:34,455 --> 01:00:36,456
His fault I was so distracted

836
01:00:36,457 --> 01:00:39,091
that I left her alone with the razor,

837
01:00:39,092 --> 01:00:40,861
and she swallowed it.

838
01:00:42,563 --> 01:00:44,898
[Woman] I will poison him.

839
01:00:45,799 --> 01:00:47,366
I have put cyanide in the sugar,

840
01:00:47,367 --> 01:00:48,601
and mixed it with his coffee

841
01:00:48,602 --> 01:00:50,670
for the last two weeks.

842
01:00:50,671 --> 01:00:52,472
Soon he will be dead.

843
01:00:52,473 --> 01:00:54,041
And I will be free.

844
01:00:55,676 --> 01:00:56,677
Oh my god.

845
01:00:57,711 --> 01:01:00,481
(dramatic music)

846
01:01:15,295 --> 01:01:17,865
(loud banging)

847
01:01:19,266 --> 01:01:20,467
Please work, please, please.

848
01:01:20,468 --> 01:01:21,735
Please stop it.

849
01:01:34,582 --> 01:01:36,382
(loud banging)

850
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:37,217
Shut up.

851
01:01:43,356 --> 01:01:45,959
(loud banging)

852
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:49,730
(dramatic music)

853
01:01:59,973 --> 01:02:00,974
Please stop.

854
01:02:02,409 --> 01:02:03,243
Stop it.

855
01:02:12,653 --> 01:02:14,422
What are you doing?

856
01:02:15,723 --> 01:02:17,457
I thought you went out.

857
01:02:17,458 --> 01:02:19,125
Listen, I don't have time
for your shit today, okay.

858
01:02:19,126 --> 01:02:20,259
I'm exhausted.

859
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:21,595
I told you that.

860
01:02:23,163 --> 01:02:25,164
What are you doing anyway?

861
01:02:25,165 --> 01:02:27,900
The drains clogged so I
called the manager, and.

862
01:02:27,901 --> 01:02:29,268
It's not clogged.

863
01:02:29,269 --> 01:02:31,271
You have the stopper in.

864
01:02:35,175 --> 01:02:38,478
What the hell's going on with you?

865
01:02:38,479 --> 01:02:41,549
I don't know what's going on, Jeff.

866
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:43,817
You're tired.

867
01:02:44,985 --> 01:02:47,219
I think maybe we should
call your sister.

868
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:49,589
I couldn't even use the
phone to call the manager,

869
01:02:49,590 --> 01:02:52,925
because it's broken like
everything else in this apartment.

870
01:02:52,926 --> 01:02:54,495
This again, okay.

871
01:02:56,163 --> 01:02:59,566
I think, maybe you should
take some sleeping pills.

872
01:02:59,567 --> 01:03:02,002
So now you want to drug me?

873
01:03:04,037 --> 01:03:06,338
You need the rest.

874
01:03:06,339 --> 01:03:08,174
You'll be fine.

875
01:03:08,175 --> 01:03:09,009
Trust me.

876
01:03:11,344 --> 01:03:13,279
You're not listening to me Jeff.

877
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,181
I'm done listening.

878
01:03:15,182 --> 01:03:17,750
You keep me up every
night with your cleaning.

879
01:03:17,751 --> 01:03:20,086
And your moving around furniture.

880
01:03:20,087 --> 01:03:22,422
I don't know what you're talking about.

881
01:03:22,423 --> 01:03:24,424
Why do you think people
are banging on the walls?

882
01:03:24,425 --> 01:03:26,359
You're keeping them up.

883
01:03:27,828 --> 01:03:30,196
I don't get up and move
the furniture around.

884
01:03:30,197 --> 01:03:31,197
It's not me.

885
01:03:31,198 --> 01:03:32,198
Bullshit.

886
01:03:32,199 --> 01:03:33,033
Enough.

887
01:03:40,974 --> 01:03:44,911
I don't, I don't want
to stay here tonight.

888
01:03:44,912 --> 01:03:47,347
I don't know what's going on.

889
01:03:53,053 --> 01:03:54,286
We'll figure it out
in the morning, okay.

890
01:03:54,287 --> 01:03:55,121
I'm sorry.

891
01:03:55,122 --> 01:03:56,389
Just take this.

892
01:03:57,357 --> 01:03:58,825
Just take it.

893
01:03:58,826 --> 01:04:00,292
Just take it.

894
01:04:00,293 --> 01:04:01,128
Please.

895
01:04:02,996 --> 01:04:04,764
You need rest.

896
01:04:04,765 --> 01:04:05,599
Come on.

897
01:04:10,804 --> 01:04:11,639
Okay.

898
01:04:15,208 --> 01:04:17,144
That's good, now sleep.

899
01:04:20,213 --> 01:04:22,114
All the anger and rage I have hidden

900
01:04:22,115 --> 01:04:24,751
since the baby died came out.

901
01:04:24,752 --> 01:04:25,586
He's gone.

902
01:04:26,954 --> 01:04:28,722
But the hate remains.

903
01:04:29,923 --> 01:04:33,426
Try as I might, I cannot
remember what happened.

904
01:04:33,427 --> 01:04:35,862
I awoke and found him dead.

905
01:04:35,863 --> 01:04:39,533
And I know that it was
I who had killed him.

906
01:04:40,701 --> 01:04:43,135
The blood covered the
wall of the nursery.

907
01:04:43,136 --> 01:04:44,437
The two cops who visited

908
01:04:44,438 --> 01:04:47,273
when the baby had died
said they'd return.

909
01:04:47,274 --> 01:04:49,676
I had to do something.

910
01:04:49,677 --> 01:04:51,878
I cleaned it as best I could.

911
01:04:51,879 --> 01:04:53,880
But it was no use.

912
01:04:53,881 --> 01:04:55,883
I had to hide the stain.

913
01:04:58,118 --> 01:04:59,786
He is gone and I am still here

914
01:04:59,787 --> 01:05:02,088
in this awful place,

915
01:05:02,089 --> 01:05:05,458
with my baby dead, I
have nothing to live for.

916
01:05:05,459 --> 01:05:07,560
My punishment is to remain here, alone.

917
01:05:07,561 --> 01:05:08,395
Forever.

918
01:05:11,164 --> 01:05:13,032
I will never leave.

919
01:05:13,033 --> 01:05:14,968
Never leave this place.

920
01:05:16,369 --> 01:05:17,805
Never have peace.

921
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:20,808
I am resolved.

922
01:05:22,676 --> 01:05:24,678
I must take my own life.

923
01:05:37,691 --> 01:05:38,526
Look.

924
01:05:51,439 --> 01:05:52,773
Did you read it?

925
01:05:54,307 --> 01:05:55,142
Yeah.

926
01:05:57,310 --> 01:05:58,145
So what?

927
01:05:59,947 --> 01:06:00,781
So what?

928
01:06:01,915 --> 01:06:03,650
Jeff someone was murdered here.

929
01:06:03,651 --> 01:06:05,151
She killed him in that room,

930
01:06:05,152 --> 01:06:07,488
and then she killed herself.

931
01:06:10,624 --> 01:06:12,793
How does that affect us?

932
01:06:14,595 --> 01:06:16,764
How does that affect us?

933
01:06:18,832 --> 01:06:19,667
Yeah?

934
01:06:21,168 --> 01:06:23,437
I think she's still here.

935
01:06:25,372 --> 01:06:27,307
Listen, that's crazy.

936
01:06:29,843 --> 01:06:30,678
I'm here.

937
01:06:32,012 --> 01:06:33,413
I'll protect you.

938
01:06:34,782 --> 01:06:36,784
You need to go to sleep.

939
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:53,767
I'm so tired.

940
01:07:12,453 --> 01:07:14,622
Please get me out of here.

941
01:07:24,798 --> 01:07:28,401
(loud music in background)

942
01:07:35,042 --> 01:07:35,876
Jeff.

943
01:09:10,270 --> 01:09:12,271
I know you're in there.

944
01:09:12,272 --> 01:09:13,106
Open up.

945
01:09:33,961 --> 01:09:36,730
(dramatic music)

946
01:11:05,953 --> 01:11:06,787
Jeff.

947
01:11:10,357 --> 01:11:11,691
Jeff, is that you?

948
01:11:11,692 --> 01:11:14,260
Who the fuck is Jeff?

949
01:11:14,261 --> 01:11:15,294
Who are you?

950
01:11:15,295 --> 01:11:16,563
Where you been?

951
01:11:16,564 --> 01:11:17,930
You think you just go
out any time of night?

952
01:11:17,931 --> 01:11:19,832
Where is Porter?

953
01:11:19,833 --> 01:11:21,400
Where's Porter?

954
01:11:21,401 --> 01:11:22,602
Who the fuck is Porter?

955
01:11:22,603 --> 01:11:24,437
Who's Jeff, you little slut?

956
01:11:24,438 --> 01:11:26,405
What have you done with my baby?

957
01:11:26,406 --> 01:11:27,406
It was an accident.

958
01:11:27,407 --> 01:11:28,641
I told you that.

959
01:11:28,642 --> 01:11:29,842
How many times do I have to tell?

960
01:11:29,843 --> 01:11:30,678
Porter!

961
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:32,945
Are you fucking mental.

962
01:11:32,946 --> 01:11:34,647
It's been almost a year.

963
01:11:34,648 --> 01:11:36,149
I'll the police.

964
01:11:42,355 --> 01:11:44,356
Enough of this shit.

965
01:11:44,357 --> 01:11:47,694
I'm gonna teach you a lesson
you won't forget so quick.

966
01:11:47,695 --> 01:11:49,462
My fiance's gonna be home any minute.

967
01:11:49,463 --> 01:11:52,232
I'm your husband, you dumb slut.

968
01:11:54,067 --> 01:11:56,403
I'm sick of your crazy shit.

969
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:01,675
The baby is dead.

970
01:12:02,710 --> 01:12:04,377
Get over it already.

971
01:12:05,879 --> 01:12:08,616
(dramatic music)

972
01:12:24,665 --> 01:12:26,667
(yells)

973
01:13:28,829 --> 01:13:29,663
Porter.

974
01:13:31,298 --> 01:13:32,132
Porter.

975
01:13:33,366 --> 01:13:34,434
Come on.

976
01:13:34,435 --> 01:13:35,568
Please.

977
01:13:35,569 --> 01:13:37,237
Let me in you bitch.

978
01:14:00,327 --> 01:14:03,096
(dramatic music)

979
01:16:34,982 --> 01:16:35,816
I'm sorry.

980
01:16:39,086 --> 01:16:40,187
I'm so sorry.

981
01:17:14,254 --> 01:17:16,356
(buzzer)

982
01:17:18,158 --> 01:17:21,328
Hello, we're here to see the sublet.

983
01:17:25,633 --> 01:17:26,833
Hello.

984
01:17:26,834 --> 01:17:28,168
Is anyone there?

985
01:17:35,075 --> 01:17:37,478
I don't think anyone's there.

986
01:17:52,726 --> 01:17:55,327
(buzzer)

987
01:17:55,328 --> 01:17:56,163
Hello.

988
01:17:57,931 --> 01:17:58,766
Hello.

906
01:17:59,767 --> 01:18:04,544
Synced and fixed by H@w-to-kiLL.
