1
00:00:01,761 --> 00:00:03,027
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:03,029 --> 00:00:05,763
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:05,765 --> 00:00:08,800
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,

4
00:00:08,802 --> 00:00:11,836
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

5
00:00:11,838 --> 00:00:15,440
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

6
00:00:15,442 --> 00:00:20,745
I hunted down the man who killed my mother,

7
00:00:20,747 --> 00:00:24,048
and I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

8
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:27,352
I am The Flash.

9
00:00:27,354 --> 00:00:29,087
<i>Previously on "The Flash"...</i>

10
00:00:29,089 --> 00:00:31,856
I'm in full-on Vibe mode right now.

11
00:00:31,858 --> 00:00:34,592
I wasn't fast enough to protect Iris.

12
00:00:34,594 --> 00:00:35,827
I felt slower.

13
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:38,429
I did it. I stole your speed.

14
00:00:38,431 --> 00:00:39,764
I gave it to Zoom.

15
00:00:39,766 --> 00:00:41,199
Give me back my daughter.

16
00:00:41,201 --> 00:00:45,203
Bring me the rest of Flash's speed.

17
00:00:45,205 --> 00:00:46,504
I told you we're a team.

18
00:00:46,506 --> 00:00:48,039
We're gonna help you save Jesse.

19
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:49,474
We're going to Earth-2.

20
00:00:52,107 --> 00:00:54,040
Journal log entry 115,

21
00:00:54,042 --> 00:00:56,276
my last entry.

22
00:00:56,278 --> 00:00:59,813
On this earth, we're closing the breaches,

23
00:00:59,815 --> 00:01:01,448
all of them.

24
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:05,652
Soon, every portal
between this earth and mine

25
00:01:05,654 --> 00:01:07,220
will no longer exist.

26
00:01:07,222 --> 00:01:11,258
I've become distracted by this Earth,

27
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,727
its problems, its people.

28
00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:14,928
29.

29
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:16,930
28.

30
00:01:16,932 --> 00:01:18,431
27.

31
00:01:18,433 --> 00:01:19,966
26.

32
00:01:19,968 --> 00:01:22,402
But the one thing I never lost track of

33
00:01:22,404 --> 00:01:24,070
was you, Jesse.

34
00:01:24,072 --> 00:01:26,573
You are my conscience, my beating heart.

35
00:01:26,575 --> 00:01:28,208
You're the reason I made it this far

36
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:30,877
in my fight against Zoom, and now

37
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:34,114
I just need you to hang on.

38
00:01:34,116 --> 00:01:39,419
Hang on a little bit longer because...

39
00:01:39,421 --> 00:01:41,154
I'm coming to get you,

40
00:01:41,156 --> 00:01:44,925
and this time...

41
00:01:44,927 --> 00:01:46,293
I'm not coming alone.

42
00:01:56,004 --> 00:01:59,873
Bam. Uhh, that's how it's done.

43
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:01,308
- Ooh.
- Whoo.

44
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,809
He shoots. He scores.

45
00:02:02,811 --> 00:02:04,778
Not bad for a guy who got a C in gym.

46
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,845
D plus.

47
00:02:05,847 --> 00:02:07,447
Straight up F right here.

48
00:02:07,449 --> 00:02:09,249
Can't believe it.
We closed all the breaches.

49
00:02:09,251 --> 00:02:10,850
All except the one.

50
00:02:10,852 --> 00:02:12,452
Our last way to Earth-2.

51
00:02:12,454 --> 00:02:14,054
Ready?

52
00:02:14,056 --> 00:02:16,790
Yeah, I just have a few things
to take care of first.

53
00:02:16,792 --> 00:02:18,992
Just a reminder, Allen...

54
00:02:18,994 --> 00:02:20,860
Clock's ticking.

55
00:02:20,862 --> 00:02:22,629
It always is.

00:02:26,501 --> 00:02:27,934
You know you haven't made lasagna

58
00:02:27,936 --> 00:02:29,035
since I left for college?

59
00:02:29,037 --> 00:02:31,104
Well,

60
00:02:31,106 --> 00:02:33,440
college is a hell of a lot
closer than another Earth.

61
00:02:33,442 --> 00:02:35,842
Hey.

62
00:02:35,844 --> 00:02:38,645
Did you tell Henry?

63
00:02:38,647 --> 00:02:40,814
No. I... look, if he knew,

64
00:02:40,816 --> 00:02:42,682
he would just try to talk me out of it

65
00:02:42,684 --> 00:02:45,285
and he probably would, so...

66
00:02:45,287 --> 00:02:48,488
Dad, can you give us a minute?

67
00:02:49,992 --> 00:02:53,193
Yeah, I'll make us some coffee.

68
00:02:55,664 --> 00:02:57,497
Look, Iris.

69
00:02:57,499 --> 00:03:00,967
I know that this is...

70
00:03:00,969 --> 00:03:04,270
Nuts is the only word
I can think of right now,

71
00:03:04,272 --> 00:03:06,940
but it's not like I've never
done anything dangerous before.

72
00:03:06,942 --> 00:03:10,844
Look, I... I get why you are doing this.

73
00:03:10,846 --> 00:03:12,746
Innocent people are in danger.

74
00:03:12,748 --> 00:03:15,315
That's always been the direction
that you've run in,

75
00:03:15,317 --> 00:03:18,018
even... even when you ran
a little bit slower.

76
00:03:19,855 --> 00:03:21,521
I just...

77
00:03:21,523 --> 00:03:23,523
I want to make sure
that you're not doing this

78
00:03:23,525 --> 00:03:26,026
because you think that you don't
have anything left here anymore.

79
00:03:28,764 --> 00:03:31,564
This isn't about Patty.

80
00:03:31,566 --> 00:03:33,166
It's not.

81
00:03:33,168 --> 00:03:36,169
I mean, of course, you know,

82
00:03:36,171 --> 00:03:38,271
I miss her a lot,

83
00:03:38,273 --> 00:03:41,041
but I know what I have here.

84
00:03:41,043 --> 00:03:43,343
I love my life.

85
00:03:43,345 --> 00:03:46,446
I love my job, being The Flash.

86
00:03:46,448 --> 00:03:50,083
I love you and Joe.

87
00:03:50,085 --> 00:03:52,585
I'm not trying to escape.

88
00:03:52,587 --> 00:03:55,422
I promise.

89
00:03:55,424 --> 00:03:57,991
Go win, Barry,

90
00:03:57,993 --> 00:04:01,795
and then come home.

91
00:04:01,797 --> 00:04:03,363
All right.

92
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:06,399
All right, Barry, listen to me.

93
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:08,234
You're about to go
through the looking glass.

94
00:04:08,236 --> 00:04:09,969
You're gonna see things that look and feel

95
00:04:09,971 --> 00:04:11,104
familiar, but they're not.

96
00:04:11,106 --> 00:04:12,839
Up is down. Black is white,

97
00:04:12,841 --> 00:04:14,874
and do not let yourself
get sucked in emotionally,

98
00:04:14,876 --> 00:04:16,876
and good luck.

99
00:04:16,878 --> 00:04:18,545
Look, if we're not back

100
00:04:18,547 --> 00:04:20,780
in 48 hours, that means that Zoom has us.

101
00:04:20,782 --> 00:04:22,849
If that happens,

102
00:04:22,851 --> 00:04:24,084
you have to close the breach.

103
00:04:24,086 --> 00:04:25,885
We're not gonna do that.

104
00:04:27,422 --> 00:04:29,556
You get yourself back here
in one piece, all right?

105
00:04:29,558 --> 00:04:30,924
Don't make me come and get you.

106
00:04:30,926 --> 00:04:33,059
No.

107
00:04:34,663 --> 00:04:36,429
I wrote this for my parents and Dante.

108
00:04:36,431 --> 00:04:39,833
If I don't come back,
make sure he gets them.

109
00:04:39,835 --> 00:04:41,301
Cisco, you're coming back.

110
00:04:41,303 --> 00:04:43,436
Caitlin, please.

111
00:04:43,438 --> 00:04:46,573
Okay, I will.

112
00:04:46,575 --> 00:04:48,541
Thank you.

113
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:51,978
- Be careful.
- Yeah.

114
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,546
Okay.

115
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:59,319
You too, Harry. Snow.

116
00:04:59,321 --> 00:05:00,787
I hope you get your daughter back.

117
00:05:00,789 --> 00:05:02,822
I'll make sure you get your son back.

118
00:05:07,562 --> 00:05:09,629
You don't have to do this.

119
00:05:09,631 --> 00:05:12,398
Yeah, I do.

120
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,502
Is anybody else feeling panic right now?

121
00:05:15,504 --> 00:05:17,403
I chickened out of bungee
jumping when I was 18,

122
00:05:17,405 --> 00:05:19,139
but this is categorically a lot scarier.

123
00:05:19,141 --> 00:05:20,740
Once I turn the speed cannon on,

124
00:05:20,742 --> 00:05:23,143
the three of you will be able
to pass through unharmed,

125
00:05:23,145 --> 00:05:25,411
but Barry, you need to make
sure you keep your speed up.

126
00:05:25,413 --> 00:05:26,412
Mm-hmm.

127
00:05:26,414 --> 00:05:28,781
I... I got no spit.

128
00:05:28,783 --> 00:05:30,617
- "Jaws."
- I'm not just quoting "Jaws."

129
00:05:30,619 --> 00:05:33,052
I mean my mouth is really dry right now.

130
00:05:33,054 --> 00:05:34,420
Do not get distracted

131
00:05:34,422 --> 00:05:36,656
by anything you see along the way.

132
00:05:36,658 --> 00:05:38,224
What are we gonna see?

133
00:05:38,226 --> 00:05:40,760
Everything.

134
00:05:40,762 --> 00:05:42,629
Do it, Jay.

135
00:05:47,869 --> 00:05:51,337
Okay, let's go.

136
00:06:06,354 --> 00:06:07,487
Caitlin, look out!

137
00:06:09,124 --> 00:06:11,591
You okay?

138
00:06:11,593 --> 00:06:13,193
Uh, yeah, I'm fine.

139
00:06:13,195 --> 00:06:15,862
What happened?

140
00:06:15,864 --> 00:06:17,931
With the rest of the breaches closed,

141
00:06:17,933 --> 00:06:20,033
the energy surge
to this last remaining breach

142
00:06:20,035 --> 00:06:21,768
must have destabilized it.

143
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:23,603
Well, what does that mean?

144
00:06:23,605 --> 00:06:25,471
As long as it's unstable

145
00:06:25,473 --> 00:06:27,540
Barry and Cisco will be trapped over there.

146
00:06:46,595 --> 00:06:48,795
Holy 2001.

147
00:06:48,797 --> 00:06:52,031
I feel like I just opened my third eye.

148
00:06:53,602 --> 00:06:55,935
Oh, my God.

149
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,741
Come on.

150
00:07:01,743 --> 00:07:03,142
Ow.

151
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,560
Welcome to Earth-2.

152
00:07:36,662 --> 00:07:38,762
Toto, I've got a feeling

153
00:07:38,764 --> 00:07:40,030
we're not in Kansas anymore.

154
00:07:40,032 --> 00:07:41,731
This is amazing.

155
00:07:41,733 --> 00:07:43,867
Half these things
are just ideas on our Earth.

156
00:07:43,869 --> 00:07:46,102
- Come here.
- I mean...

157
00:07:46,104 --> 00:07:48,572
Oh, yeah.

158
00:07:49,942 --> 00:07:52,676
- Ramon.
- What?

159
00:07:52,678 --> 00:07:54,144
Not a sightseeing tour.

160
00:07:54,146 --> 00:07:55,512
Speak for yourself.

161
00:07:55,514 --> 00:07:58,815
We want our grandkids
to know we did cool stuff.

162
00:07:58,817 --> 00:07:59,950
- Dr. Wells.
- Henry.

163
00:07:59,952 --> 00:08:01,017
Welcome back.

164
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:02,185
We weren't expecting you.

165
00:08:02,187 --> 00:08:04,754
- Ahh!
- Yes...

166
00:08:04,756 --> 00:08:05,922
I didn't tell anyone

167
00:08:05,924 --> 00:08:07,490
I was coming back.

168
00:08:07,492 --> 00:08:08,692
I thought you might've left town

169
00:08:08,694 --> 00:08:09,693
with all that's been happening.

170
00:08:09,695 --> 00:08:11,561
- Right.
- Are your friends okay?

171
00:08:11,563 --> 00:08:14,464
Yes, they're... they're fine.

172
00:08:14,466 --> 00:08:17,601
They're excitable.

173
00:08:17,603 --> 00:08:18,868
This is, um...

174
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,437
Henry Hewitt, lab assistant.

175
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:21,972
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

176
00:08:21,974 --> 00:08:23,306
And you... um, this is Barry.

177
00:08:23,308 --> 00:08:24,341
This is Cisco.

178
00:08:24,343 --> 00:08:25,675
- I'm Cisco.
- Yeah.

179
00:08:25,677 --> 00:08:28,178
And you are just a nice, normal guy.

180
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,512
Okay, um...

181
00:08:29,514 --> 00:08:30,880
Dr. Wells, will you and your visitors

182
00:08:30,882 --> 00:08:32,048
be needing the conference room?

183
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:33,183
Not necessary, Henry.

184
00:08:33,185 --> 00:08:34,517
Our visit will be short.

185
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:35,852
- Okay.
- Good to see you.

186
00:08:35,854 --> 00:08:38,521
Good to see you, sir.

187
00:08:38,523 --> 00:08:39,923
He's a bad guy on Earth-1.

188
00:08:39,925 --> 00:08:41,091
He looks just like him.

189
00:08:47,165 --> 00:08:49,799
A reminder that a citywide
curfew has been issued.

190
00:08:49,801 --> 00:08:52,902
No unauthorized person
is to be out after 9:00 p.m.

191
00:08:52,904 --> 00:08:54,638
A recent increase in Zoom attacks

192
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,806
has led Mayor Snart to extend the curfew.

193
00:08:56,808 --> 00:08:58,942
The curfew was first issued after a series

194
00:08:58,944 --> 00:09:00,777
of terror attacks throughout the city...

195
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:02,679
It's worse.

196
00:09:02,681 --> 00:09:03,847
It's worse than when I left.

197
00:09:03,849 --> 00:09:05,415
Zoom has turned up his reign of terror.

198
00:09:05,417 --> 00:09:06,950
All right, then let's find Zoom fast.

199
00:09:06,952 --> 00:09:07,984
Cisco, do your thing.

200
00:09:07,986 --> 00:09:11,187
All right, Zoom...

201
00:09:11,189 --> 00:09:14,324
You can run, but you can't hide.

202
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:22,232
All right, you know what?

203
00:09:22,234 --> 00:09:23,933
You guys are crowding my space a little bit.

204
00:09:23,935 --> 00:09:25,502
I can't perform like this
under pressure, okay?

205
00:09:25,504 --> 00:09:26,836
If you could just step back
just a little bit,

206
00:09:26,838 --> 00:09:27,971
I need to do my thing. All right.

207
00:09:27,973 --> 00:09:29,105
- My mojo.
- Yes, all right.

208
00:09:29,107 --> 00:09:30,173
Thank you.

209
00:09:30,175 --> 00:09:31,775
Take two...

210
00:09:31,777 --> 00:09:33,276
Mm, ah.

211
00:09:34,846 --> 00:09:37,414
All right, Zoom.

212
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:39,616
You can run...

213
00:09:39,618 --> 00:09:40,917
Ramon, what's happening?

214
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:42,852
You know, I don't know, okay?

215
00:09:42,854 --> 00:09:44,721
I can't see anything.
I don't know what's wrong.

216
00:09:44,723 --> 00:09:46,389
Maybe I lost my powers.

217
00:09:46,391 --> 00:09:47,657
I didn't lose my powers.

218
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:49,259
Why would you lose your powers?

219
00:09:49,261 --> 00:09:50,860
Oh, here we go, the wavelength trigger's

220
00:09:50,862 --> 00:09:52,829
not responding, but that only happens if...

221
00:09:52,831 --> 00:09:54,197
The frequency is imbalanced.

222
00:09:54,199 --> 00:09:55,799
What?

223
00:09:55,801 --> 00:09:58,635
Our Earth vibrates at a
different frequency than yours.

224
00:09:58,637 --> 00:10:00,336
Harry, without that frequency...

225
00:10:00,338 --> 00:10:01,438
We're up a creek.

226
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,605
The latest attack

227
00:10:02,607 --> 00:10:04,407
was orchestrated by Zoom,

228
00:10:04,409 --> 00:10:06,643
and we understand that citizens

229
00:10:06,645 --> 00:10:07,844
of Central City are scared,

230
00:10:07,846 --> 00:10:10,246
but I can assure you the CCPD

231
00:10:10,248 --> 00:10:11,915
- has been working diligently...
- That's me.

232
00:10:11,917 --> 00:10:13,516
Yeah, it is.

233
00:10:13,518 --> 00:10:15,218
Under the leadership of Detective West.

234
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,787
We will stop Zoom. That's a promise.

235
00:10:17,789 --> 00:10:19,723
"The leadership of Detective West."

236
00:10:19,725 --> 00:10:21,191
So Joe's still a cop here.

237
00:10:21,193 --> 00:10:24,194
Yeah, but more importantly, I'm still a CSI.

238
00:10:24,196 --> 00:10:26,062
I have a plan.

239
00:10:29,201 --> 00:10:31,101
What just happened?

240
00:10:31,103 --> 00:10:33,136
Oh-ho-ho-ho, doppelganger.

241
00:10:33,138 --> 00:10:35,038
Wait, wait, wait, wait, how did I get here?

242
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,007
What... who are... who are you?

243
00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:40,076
How do you look like me?

244
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:41,544
Allen, what are you doing?

245
00:10:41,546 --> 00:10:44,214
Harrison Wells.

246
00:10:45,851 --> 00:10:47,617
The Harrison Wells.

247
00:10:47,619 --> 00:10:50,019
Oh, my God, am I in S.T.A.R. Labs?

248
00:10:50,021 --> 00:10:53,890
Okay, I have no idea what is going on here,

249
00:10:53,892 --> 00:10:56,126
but I've always wanted to meet you.

250
00:10:56,128 --> 00:10:59,562
Your thesis on string phenomenology

251
00:10:59,564 --> 00:11:00,997
was revolutionary to me.

252
00:11:00,999 --> 00:11:02,232
- Oh, man.
- I had the magazine

253
00:11:02,234 --> 00:11:04,033
laminated so I could keep it.

254
00:11:04,035 --> 00:11:06,169
- I... I just want to emulate...
- This guy's incredible.

255
00:11:06,171 --> 00:11:08,037
I won an award for it,
right over there, you see?

256
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:09,873
Oh, it's beaut...

257
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,474
Wh... wh... what did you do?

258
00:11:11,476 --> 00:11:12,642
What's wrong with you?

259
00:11:12,644 --> 00:11:13,943
Have you turned into an evil you?

260
00:11:13,945 --> 00:11:16,446
Relax. Just knocked him out.

261
00:11:16,448 --> 00:11:19,082
Oh, well, why'd you even
bring him over here?

262
00:11:19,084 --> 00:11:20,216
So he could become him.

263
00:11:20,218 --> 00:11:21,885
While you guys work on the goggles,

264
00:11:21,887 --> 00:11:25,188
I will go to CCPD as him
and see if I can figure out

265
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:27,457
what information they have
on Zoom's previous sightings.

266
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:29,225
We can use those sightings
to triangulate Zoom's hideout.

267
00:11:29,227 --> 00:11:30,493
Good. That's a good plan.

268
00:11:30,495 --> 00:11:31,795
Just remember what Jay said, okay?

269
00:11:31,797 --> 00:11:33,329
Things here are all sorts of trippy.

270
00:11:33,331 --> 00:11:35,165
Look, it'll be fine.

271
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:41,237
I can handle it.

272
00:11:41,239 --> 00:11:43,373
It'll be easy.

273
00:11:53,285 --> 00:11:54,818
Whoa.

274
00:12:01,126 --> 00:12:05,261
Yo, this is crazy.

275
00:12:05,263 --> 00:12:07,197
Get your hands off me.

276
00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:08,998
Captain?

277
00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:12,235
Look, I don't know nothin',

278
00:12:12,237 --> 00:12:14,571
so I ain't sayin' nothing'.

279
00:12:14,573 --> 00:12:15,638
Okay.

280
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,040
Deadshot, wh...

281
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:19,876
That's not funny, Allen.

282
00:12:19,878 --> 00:12:21,377
I hate that nickname.

283
00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:22,946
Okay, look, I know I'm not...

284
00:12:22,948 --> 00:12:24,881
I'm not the best shot
in the department, but...

285
00:12:24,883 --> 00:12:27,450
Not the best?

286
00:12:27,452 --> 00:12:28,952
Lawton, you are the worst

287
00:12:28,954 --> 00:12:30,553
shot in the entire department.

288
00:12:30,555 --> 00:12:31,888
Hey, why don't you book Singh here,

289
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,189
and I'll be in there in a moment?

290
00:12:33,191 --> 00:12:34,224
Whatever you say, partner.

291
00:12:34,226 --> 00:12:36,960
- Mm.
- Come on.

292
00:12:36,962 --> 00:12:39,062
Oh, and just for the record,

293
00:12:39,064 --> 00:12:41,531
my marksmanship proficiency ratings

294
00:12:41,533 --> 00:12:43,166
went up by two points last month.

295
00:12:43,168 --> 00:12:44,467
All right?

296
00:12:44,469 --> 00:12:45,768
Two points.

297
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,036
Whoo.

298
00:12:47,038 --> 00:12:48,571
Iris.

299
00:12:50,909 --> 00:12:53,276
You're Detective West.

300
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:54,377
The one, the only.

301
00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:55,979
Yeah.

302
00:12:55,981 --> 00:12:59,849
Can I see you for a second, CSI Allen?

303
00:12:59,851 --> 00:13:01,918
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

304
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,686
Hmm.

305
00:13:03,688 --> 00:13:06,289
Um, what are you doing?

306
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:07,624
What?

307
00:13:07,626 --> 00:13:09,659
I think a little office PDA

308
00:13:09,661 --> 00:13:11,160
between husband and wife is okay.

309
00:13:11,162 --> 00:13:13,663
Husband and wife?

310
00:13:13,665 --> 00:13:16,366
Yeah, that's what happens
when you do the vows,

311
00:13:16,368 --> 00:13:17,634
exchange the rings.

312
00:13:17,636 --> 00:13:18,902
Where is your ring?

313
00:13:18,904 --> 00:13:19,936
Uh...

314
00:13:19,938 --> 00:13:22,338
People should know

315
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,640
that you are a taken man.

316
00:13:25,844 --> 00:13:27,677
- That's so weird.
- What's that?

317
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,178
My meta-human alert app.

318
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,580
It thinks that you're a meta-human.

319
00:13:30,582 --> 00:13:32,115
That is so weird.

320
00:13:32,117 --> 00:13:33,650
Yeah, it must be on the fritz.

321
00:13:33,652 --> 00:13:35,685
Mm, let's go.

322
00:13:35,687 --> 00:13:37,220
Where are we going?

323
00:13:37,222 --> 00:13:38,688
Home.

324
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:41,024
Come on.

325
00:13:50,302 --> 00:13:52,535
Where do you people get off

326
00:13:52,537 --> 00:13:55,505
robbing Central City's Royal Bank?

327
00:13:55,507 --> 00:13:58,875
This town belongs to Zoom,

328
00:13:58,877 --> 00:14:02,912
and those of us he deems worthy
enough to enforce his will.

329
00:14:02,914 --> 00:14:05,081
Here.

330
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,749
Take it.

331
00:14:09,921 --> 00:14:12,488
Thanks a million.

332
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:15,124
Or should I say two?

333
00:14:20,598 --> 00:14:22,332
Hmm.

334
00:14:22,334 --> 00:14:24,901
No.

335
00:14:26,071 --> 00:14:28,204
Wait, please.

336
00:14:28,206 --> 00:14:29,205
Don't hurt me.

337
00:14:29,207 --> 00:14:30,206
Hurt you?

338
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:32,842
I just want to give you a kiss.

339
00:14:45,724 --> 00:14:48,524
Now what did I tell you
about watching that behind?

340
00:14:48,526 --> 00:14:50,259
I thought that was your job.

341
00:14:56,868 --> 00:14:59,902
Good thing the only man I can kiss

342
00:14:59,904 --> 00:15:01,437
is the only one I want to.

343
00:15:01,439 --> 00:15:03,172
Just got word some breachers came through.

344
00:15:03,174 --> 00:15:04,974
Ooh, you know my favorite thing

345
00:15:04,976 --> 00:15:06,943
is to kill people from other Earths.

346
00:15:06,945 --> 00:15:08,611
Today's your lucky day.

347
00:15:18,465 --> 00:15:20,832
Oh, gosh.

348
00:15:26,573 --> 00:15:28,006
This is nice.

349
00:15:29,142 --> 00:15:31,009
Our home.

350
00:15:31,011 --> 00:15:32,877
I mean, I forgot, I guess.

351
00:15:39,777 --> 00:15:41,043
What is wrong with you?

352
00:15:41,045 --> 00:15:42,878
You've been acting weird all day.

353
00:15:46,917 --> 00:15:49,451
Um...

354
00:15:49,453 --> 00:15:52,287
I'm just not myself, I guess.

355
00:15:53,858 --> 00:15:55,457
Your mom called.

356
00:16:18,215 --> 00:16:21,083
Allen residence.

357
00:16:21,085 --> 00:16:22,851
Hello?

358
00:16:22,853 --> 00:16:25,120
- Uh, hello?
- Mom.

359
00:16:25,122 --> 00:16:28,423
Wow, you certainly
took your time calling back.

360
00:16:30,427 --> 00:16:34,196
Yeah, um, I'm... I'm sorry about that.

361
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:36,131
Thank you so much

362
00:16:36,133 --> 00:16:38,133
for the anniversary tickets to Atlantis.

363
00:16:38,135 --> 00:16:41,036
Your dad and I have always wanted to go.

364
00:16:41,038 --> 00:16:43,705
Um, I'm... I'm really glad you liked them.

365
00:16:43,707 --> 00:16:46,408
Are you okay?

366
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:49,645
You sound kind of strange.

367
00:16:49,647 --> 00:16:51,079
I'm fine.

368
00:16:51,081 --> 00:16:52,214
I'm... I'm...

369
00:16:52,216 --> 00:16:53,649
Hey, I know. Maybe I should

370
00:16:53,651 --> 00:16:55,951
give the plane tickets to you and Iris.

371
00:16:55,953 --> 00:16:57,686
Nice little romantic getaway.

372
00:16:57,688 --> 00:16:59,988
You two could get started
on giving me a grandchild.

373
00:17:01,091 --> 00:17:05,227
No, I want you to use them.

374
00:17:05,229 --> 00:17:08,196
I'm really glad to...

375
00:17:08,198 --> 00:17:09,998
hear you happy, Mom.

376
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,634
Aw, I love you, Barry.

377
00:17:14,538 --> 00:17:16,171
I love you too.

378
00:17:16,173 --> 00:17:18,140
Okay, bye-bye, honey.

379
00:17:23,747 --> 00:17:25,180
Baby, what's wrong?

380
00:17:25,182 --> 00:17:26,481
Uh, nothing.

381
00:17:26,483 --> 00:17:28,083
It was, uh...

382
00:17:28,085 --> 00:17:30,452
Um, it was just good to talk to my mom.

383
00:17:32,523 --> 00:17:33,889
We should get ready, yeah?

384
00:17:33,891 --> 00:17:35,891
- Yeah.
- Okay.

385
00:17:41,532 --> 00:17:46,034
Where is he?

386
00:17:46,036 --> 00:17:48,070
Where is he?

387
00:17:48,072 --> 00:17:49,905
I don't know. I can't find him anywhere.

388
00:17:49,907 --> 00:17:51,974
Yeah, well, he better show up soon

389
00:17:51,976 --> 00:17:53,241
because he's been gone for hours.

390
00:17:53,243 --> 00:17:54,676
and we only have so many of those left

391
00:17:54,678 --> 00:17:56,345
before Zoom needs the speed.

392
00:17:56,347 --> 00:17:58,580
Oh, you're talking about Barry.

393
00:17:58,582 --> 00:18:00,248
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

394
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,717
Don't worry about him. He'll be fine.

395
00:18:01,719 --> 00:18:03,018
Who'd you think I was talking about?

396
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,286
I thought you were talking about me.

397
00:18:04,288 --> 00:18:05,687
- You?
- Yeah,

398
00:18:05,689 --> 00:18:06,588
'cause we found Barry's double,

399
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,689
so where the hell am I?

400
00:18:07,691 --> 00:18:08,857
You know, I always thought

401
00:18:08,859 --> 00:18:10,626
in another life I was, like,

402
00:18:10,628 --> 00:18:12,160
I don't know, like a really

403
00:18:12,162 --> 00:18:14,463
wealthy, famous inventor,

404
00:18:14,465 --> 00:18:16,965
you know, sort of like
the Earth-2 Elon Musk.

405
00:18:16,967 --> 00:18:19,968
Only with less RBF, obviously.

406
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,403
Here's some advice for you.

407
00:18:21,405 --> 00:18:23,405
How about spending more time
looking for Zoom

408
00:18:23,407 --> 00:18:25,707
and less time worrying about
what someone who is not you

409
00:18:25,709 --> 00:18:28,577
is doing with their life?

410
00:18:53,637 --> 00:18:54,870
Whoa.

411
00:18:57,474 --> 00:18:59,174
Joe can sing.

412
00:18:59,176 --> 00:19:01,176
He's the best.

413
00:19:01,178 --> 00:19:03,245
Right.

414
00:19:14,224 --> 00:19:16,892
Ooh.

415
00:19:16,894 --> 00:19:18,126
Hey, baby.

416
00:19:18,128 --> 00:19:19,227
Hi.

417
00:19:19,229 --> 00:19:20,595
Mm, oh, yeah.

418
00:19:20,597 --> 00:19:22,197
Joe, hey.

419
00:19:22,199 --> 00:19:23,799
It's Joseph, Bartholomew.

420
00:19:23,801 --> 00:19:25,600
Pop, be nice.

421
00:19:25,602 --> 00:19:26,868
You too, babe.

422
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:27,869
I'll be right back.

423
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,971
Yeah.

424
00:19:32,509 --> 00:19:34,776
So you're a singer.

425
00:19:36,413 --> 00:19:37,979
So you're still an idiot.

426
00:19:41,318 --> 00:19:44,386
Are you upset with me?

427
00:19:44,388 --> 00:19:47,355
Or you just... you just don't like me?

428
00:19:47,357 --> 00:19:48,557
Have you lost your mind?

429
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,158
Central City's going to hell

430
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,893
in a handbasket because this lunatic Zoom

431
00:19:51,895 --> 00:19:53,295
is running around killing folks,

432
00:19:53,297 --> 00:19:54,596
and you got my daughter on the front lines.

433
00:19:54,598 --> 00:19:56,331
Wait... wh... me?

434
00:19:56,333 --> 00:20:00,569
It has always been about you, Bartholomew.

435
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:02,608
You're the most
selfish person I've ever met.

436
00:20:02,697 --> 00:20:04,697
And I'm a musician; we're all selfish.

437
00:20:04,699 --> 00:20:06,232
You wanted to get your PhD

438
00:20:06,234 --> 00:20:07,567
so you could further your career,

439
00:20:07,569 --> 00:20:09,202
and she had to become a police officer

440
00:20:09,204 --> 00:20:10,436
to pay your tuition.

441
00:20:10,438 --> 00:20:12,205
We both know

442
00:20:12,207 --> 00:20:13,306
that she'd be safer going back

443
00:20:13,308 --> 00:20:14,474
to write at the newspaper.

444
00:20:14,476 --> 00:20:17,610
Oh, Dad, please, stop.

445
00:20:17,612 --> 00:20:19,746
CCPN was an internship.

446
00:20:19,748 --> 00:20:22,081
All I did was get coffee for real writers.

447
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:25,018
Being a cop like grandpa is what I love.

448
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:28,421
You raised me to be tough, and I am.

449
00:20:30,525 --> 00:20:32,725
Everything's fine,

450
00:20:32,727 --> 00:20:34,761
and we're here to have fun, right?

451
00:20:34,763 --> 00:20:36,029
Right.

452
00:20:36,031 --> 00:20:39,565
Everything's great.

453
00:20:46,474 --> 00:20:47,907
How's it going?

454
00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:50,977
Uh, slow, which is not a good adjective

455
00:20:50,979 --> 00:20:53,479
when it comes to a speed cannon.

456
00:20:53,481 --> 00:20:56,749
Well, we got another problem.

457
00:20:56,751 --> 00:20:59,752
Why do we always
have to have another problem?

458
00:21:01,723 --> 00:21:02,955
You've got to see this.

459
00:21:02,957 --> 00:21:05,291
Somebody call The Flash.

460
00:21:09,097 --> 00:21:11,798
His name is Adam Fells,

461
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,300
but he calls himself Geomancer.

462
00:21:14,302 --> 00:21:16,469
So this meta-human is a breacher?

463
00:21:16,471 --> 00:21:18,071
No, Fells died on my Earth.

464
00:21:18,073 --> 00:21:19,672
This must be his Earth-1 doppelganger.

465
00:21:19,674 --> 00:21:22,075
Well, at least now, we know his name.

466
00:21:22,077 --> 00:21:23,843
Might be a little easier to track him down.

467
00:21:23,845 --> 00:21:25,344
Yeah, but with Barry gone,

468
00:21:25,346 --> 00:21:27,780
how are we gonna stop him
even if we do find him?

469
00:21:27,782 --> 00:21:31,284
Well, Jay, you could shoot
yourself up with that stuff.

470
00:21:31,286 --> 00:21:32,618
What was it? Velocity...

471
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,921
- Velocity-6.
- I cannot take V-6.

472
00:21:34,923 --> 00:21:36,789
But it gave you your speed
back long enough to get that

473
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:38,424
bullet out of Wells, saved his life.

474
00:21:38,426 --> 00:21:40,626
Joe, don't ask me to take Velocity-6 again.

475
00:21:40,628 --> 00:21:42,495
Look, Jay, I'm not trying
to tell you what to do,

476
00:21:42,497 --> 00:21:44,497
but Barry is protecting your world,

477
00:21:44,499 --> 00:21:46,232
and our world needs a Flash right about now.

478
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:57,076
Jay.

479
00:21:57,078 --> 00:21:58,644
Caitlin, I like the way you look at me

480
00:21:58,646 --> 00:22:01,614
with warmth and pride, and I'm not...

481
00:22:01,616 --> 00:22:02,849
I'm not worthy of those.

482
00:22:02,851 --> 00:22:04,083
Yes, you are.

483
00:22:04,085 --> 00:22:06,219
No, I did a terrible thing, Caitlin.

484
00:22:07,622 --> 00:22:09,655
When my world's particle
accelerator went off,

485
00:22:09,657 --> 00:22:11,324
I became a speedster.

486
00:22:11,326 --> 00:22:13,059
I became the fastest man alive,

487
00:22:13,061 --> 00:22:16,095
only... only it wasn't enough for me.

488
00:22:16,097 --> 00:22:19,799
I wasn't... I wasn't fast enough.

489
00:22:19,801 --> 00:22:21,834
So I figured with my scientific background,

490
00:22:21,836 --> 00:22:23,336
I could increase my powers,

491
00:22:23,338 --> 00:22:25,872
and... I did.

492
00:22:25,874 --> 00:22:29,475
So you've taken Velocity-6 before?

493
00:22:29,477 --> 00:22:31,811
Yes.

494
00:22:31,813 --> 00:22:35,948
But there were some unforeseen side effects.

495
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:38,417
This is why you didn't want Barry to take it

496
00:22:38,419 --> 00:22:41,020
or even know about it.

497
00:22:41,022 --> 00:22:43,389
Zoom never stole your speed.

498
00:22:43,391 --> 00:22:46,025
This is what's making you sick.

499
00:22:46,027 --> 00:22:48,928
Velocity-6 is killing you.

500
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:51,597
I wasn't lying when I said
that stuff was dangerous.

501
00:22:53,802 --> 00:22:56,602
I've made so many mistakes.

502
00:22:56,604 --> 00:22:59,071
You have something now

503
00:22:59,073 --> 00:23:00,840
that you've never had before.

504
00:23:00,842 --> 00:23:02,141
Me.

505
00:23:02,143 --> 00:23:06,612
And I'm gonna figure this out.

506
00:23:22,664 --> 00:23:27,767
So can we talk more about
why Joseph doesn't like me?

507
00:23:27,769 --> 00:23:29,669
What's there to talk about?

508
00:23:29,671 --> 00:23:31,571
I mean, you can't stand him either.

509
00:23:31,573 --> 00:23:33,940
Right.

510
00:23:33,942 --> 00:23:36,742
Look, I can love you both

511
00:23:36,744 --> 00:23:38,778
even if you don't love each other.

512
00:23:41,516 --> 00:23:43,049
The meta-human warning app.

513
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:52,024
Don't stop singing, old man.

514
00:23:52,026 --> 00:23:53,960
That's our song.

515
00:24:00,574 --> 00:24:04,243
So which one of you lounge lizards

516
00:24:04,245 --> 00:24:06,678
is in the wrong universe?

517
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,213
Hmm?

518
00:24:09,152 --> 00:24:11,052
Show of hands.

519
00:24:11,054 --> 00:24:14,289
Don't be shy.

520
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:16,458
No, no, no.

521
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,393
Hey, handsome.

522
00:24:18,395 --> 00:24:20,395
You got something you want to tell me?

523
00:24:20,397 --> 00:24:22,630
No.

524
00:24:22,632 --> 00:24:25,700
No?

525
00:24:27,237 --> 00:24:30,739
Baby, no one's talking to me.

526
00:24:30,741 --> 00:24:31,873
What if I make 'em scream?

527
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:33,308
CCPD!

528
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:35,377
Everyone get out of here. All right, go, go.

529
00:24:35,379 --> 00:24:37,979
You are both under arrest.

530
00:24:37,981 --> 00:24:40,815
Ladies first.

531
00:24:40,817 --> 00:24:42,650
Caitlin.

532
00:24:42,652 --> 00:24:47,155
I haven't heard that name in a long time.

533
00:24:47,157 --> 00:24:48,857
But that is your name, isn't it?

534
00:24:48,859 --> 00:24:50,258
Your real name?

535
00:24:51,061 --> 00:24:52,360
Please, look...

536
00:24:52,362 --> 00:24:54,896
I know you.

537
00:24:54,898 --> 00:24:56,064
Don't do this.

538
00:24:56,066 --> 00:24:59,167
If you knew me at all,

539
00:24:59,169 --> 00:25:02,070
you would know that I hate the name Caitlin.

540
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,006
I'm Killer Frost.

541
00:25:07,177 --> 00:25:08,877
Go, all right. Go, go!

542
00:25:10,514 --> 00:25:12,680
Iris, look out!

543
00:25:14,351 --> 00:25:16,017
Dad!

544
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:18,052
Oh, my God.

545
00:25:23,527 --> 00:25:26,027
Well, hello, breacher.

546
00:25:26,029 --> 00:25:27,529
He's a speedster, babe.

547
00:25:27,531 --> 00:25:28,763
Oh, I'm shivering.

548
00:25:28,765 --> 00:25:30,565
I've been dying to kill The Flash.

549
00:25:30,567 --> 00:25:32,066
I don't want to hurt you.

550
00:25:32,068 --> 00:25:35,136
Trust me, you won't.

551
00:25:41,344 --> 00:25:42,911
Kill him.

552
00:25:48,452 --> 00:25:50,418
Come on.

553
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:53,455
God, this is making me so hot.

554
00:26:18,815 --> 00:26:20,448
This ain't over, breacher!

555
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,450
Barry!

556
00:26:25,422 --> 00:26:26,921
Oh, my God.

557
00:26:26,923 --> 00:26:29,691
Barry?

558
00:26:32,496 --> 00:26:33,761
Killer Frost and Deathstorm.

559
00:26:33,763 --> 00:26:35,430
- You know them?
- More importantly,

560
00:26:35,432 --> 00:26:37,565
they know you now;
they know that you're here.

561
00:26:37,567 --> 00:26:40,535
So Caitlin and Ronnie's
doppelgangers are evil?

562
00:26:40,537 --> 00:26:42,337
Those are some dope names, though.

563
00:26:42,339 --> 00:26:44,405
This was supposed to be
a surgical mission, Allen.

564
00:26:44,407 --> 00:26:46,140
Find Zoom's lair. Rescue Jesse.

565
00:26:46,142 --> 00:26:48,076
Get in, get out, not get involved.

566
00:26:48,078 --> 00:26:50,979
All right, well, look, I am involved, okay?

567
00:26:50,981 --> 00:26:53,114
Joe's in the hospital.
They nearly killed him.

568
00:26:53,116 --> 00:26:54,182
No, he isn't.

569
00:26:54,184 --> 00:26:56,217
Joe West, your Joe West,

570
00:26:56,219 --> 00:26:57,785
is alive and safe on your Earth,

571
00:26:57,787 --> 00:26:59,888
so is Caitlin, so is Iris.

572
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:01,022
These people, Barry,

573
00:27:01,024 --> 00:27:02,223
they're mirror reflections.

574
00:27:02,225 --> 00:27:04,125
As far as your life is concerned,

575
00:27:04,127 --> 00:27:05,960
they don't exist.

576
00:27:05,962 --> 00:27:08,796
Killer Frost, Deathstorm,
they know that you're here.

577
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:10,832
Then it's not long before
Zoom does too, and then

578
00:27:10,834 --> 00:27:12,834
my daughter's dead, and that's on you.

579
00:27:12,836 --> 00:27:15,837
Jesse still has time, okay?

580
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:17,272
Iris and Joe need me now.

581
00:27:17,274 --> 00:27:18,740
I have to get back to them! She is not Iris!

582
00:27:18,742 --> 00:27:20,041
She is Iris!

583
00:27:20,043 --> 00:27:21,209
Okay, she is to me!

584
00:27:21,211 --> 00:27:23,144
No matter what universe I'm in,

585
00:27:23,146 --> 00:27:24,512
they are my family!

586
00:27:24,514 --> 00:27:25,980
I would think by now you should get

587
00:27:25,982 --> 00:27:27,382
how important family is.

588
00:27:27,384 --> 00:27:28,683
I'm going, Wells.

589
00:27:28,685 --> 00:27:30,451
I have to.

590
00:27:31,421 --> 00:27:34,522
Find Zoom.

591
00:27:42,899 --> 00:27:44,666
I ran Adam Fells through BCI.

592
00:27:44,668 --> 00:27:47,669
Not exactly a model citizen
before he was a meta-human.

593
00:27:47,671 --> 00:27:49,837
Multiple counts of robbery and assault.

594
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:51,472
Well, if he thinks he's gonna use my city

595
00:27:51,474 --> 00:27:54,309
for a steel cage death match with The Flash,

596
00:27:54,311 --> 00:27:55,843
he's got another thing coming.

597
00:27:56,846 --> 00:27:58,413
Hey, what are you doing here?

598
00:27:58,415 --> 00:28:00,415
Wait, were we supposed
to meet up or something?

599
00:28:00,417 --> 00:28:02,350
No, I was... I was just nearby.

600
00:28:09,292 --> 00:28:10,592
Everybody okay?

601
00:28:10,594 --> 00:28:11,759
Fells has been spotted.

602
00:28:11,761 --> 00:28:13,227
Pasko and Fourth.

603
00:28:13,229 --> 00:28:15,863
Go.

604
00:28:15,865 --> 00:28:18,399
I got to go, son.

605
00:28:18,401 --> 00:28:19,567
Joe...

606
00:28:36,553 --> 00:28:38,620
Dad, are you okay?

607
00:28:41,483 --> 00:28:44,318
Damn meta-humans.

608
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:49,056
Only thing I hate more...

609
00:28:49,058 --> 00:28:50,691
is hospitals.

610
00:28:53,028 --> 00:28:55,395
Are you okay?

611
00:28:55,397 --> 00:28:57,965
Yeah.

612
00:28:57,967 --> 00:28:59,199
Just worried about you.

613
00:29:01,337 --> 00:29:02,769
There's a first.

614
00:29:05,407 --> 00:29:07,441
Baby.

615
00:29:07,443 --> 00:29:09,843
Yeah, yeah.

616
00:29:12,982 --> 00:29:16,717
You ever notice every time

617
00:29:16,719 --> 00:29:19,052
just before I do a number,

618
00:29:19,054 --> 00:29:20,721
I close my eyes for a hot second

619
00:29:20,723 --> 00:29:21,989
and I take a deep breath?

620
00:29:21,991 --> 00:29:25,492
You ever wonder what I was doing?

621
00:29:25,494 --> 00:29:27,894
Trying to remember the lyrics?

622
00:29:31,033 --> 00:29:33,867
I say a little mantra to myself

623
00:29:33,869 --> 00:29:36,336
every time before I sing.

624
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,640
"This one is for Iris.

625
00:29:39,642 --> 00:29:44,478
My baby girl."

626
00:29:48,017 --> 00:29:51,718
Every song's for you, baby.

627
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,688
Every single one.

628
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:56,590
Dad, don't talk like this, okay?

629
00:29:56,592 --> 00:29:59,359
Wh... B... Barry.

630
00:29:59,361 --> 00:30:01,561
Yeah?

631
00:30:04,933 --> 00:30:08,235
You take care of her.

632
00:30:08,237 --> 00:30:10,237
Mm.

633
00:30:10,239 --> 00:30:13,707
Dad?

634
00:30:13,709 --> 00:30:16,209
Dad? Dad? Nurse!

635
00:30:16,211 --> 00:30:17,377
Doctor! Nurse!

636
00:30:17,379 --> 00:30:18,879
Dad!

637
00:30:18,881 --> 00:30:19,846
Iris.

638
00:30:22,785 --> 00:30:26,586
No, no, no!

639
00:30:26,588 --> 00:30:29,222
No! No!

640
00:30:29,224 --> 00:30:30,657
It's okay.

641
00:30:42,646 --> 00:30:45,348
Aww, darn it.

642
00:30:45,754 --> 00:30:48,289
You don't have to do this, Lawton.

643
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,006
We're partners, right?

644
00:30:50,008 --> 00:30:51,507
You've always had my back,

645
00:30:51,509 --> 00:30:52,875
and I've got yours.

646
00:30:55,814 --> 00:30:57,413
Oh, Iris.

647
00:30:58,516 --> 00:31:00,149
- Do I know you?
- Does she know me?

648
00:31:00,151 --> 00:31:03,586
Uh, this is my good friend, Cisco Ramon.

649
00:31:03,588 --> 00:31:06,489
- Good friend?
- Yeah.

650
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:08,491
Cisco works at S.T.A.R. Labs,

651
00:31:08,493 --> 00:31:11,294
and he has built a weapon
that he believes we can use

652
00:31:11,296 --> 00:31:13,596
to neutralize, um, Killer Frost's powers.

653
00:31:13,598 --> 00:31:14,864
Great, thanks.

654
00:31:14,866 --> 00:31:16,099
I'll take it.

655
00:31:16,101 --> 00:31:20,803
Uh, please, I should really take this.

656
00:31:20,805 --> 00:31:22,272
All right.

657
00:31:22,274 --> 00:31:24,173
One of my snitches gave me a lead

658
00:31:24,175 --> 00:31:26,009
on Killer Frost and Deathstorm's location.

659
00:31:26,011 --> 00:31:27,277
We're gonna bring them in.

660
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,545
Okay, um, I'm coming with you, Iris.

661
00:31:29,547 --> 00:31:31,648
No. Barry, I just lost my father.

662
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:33,349
I cannot lose my husband too.

663
00:31:33,351 --> 00:31:36,085
All right, well, Cisco's
the only one that knows

664
00:31:36,087 --> 00:31:38,054
how to operate the device,
so you have to take him.

665
00:31:38,056 --> 00:31:40,490
I can't put a civilian in harm's way.

666
00:31:40,492 --> 00:31:42,191
Look, I've seen fire, and I've seen rain.

667
00:31:42,193 --> 00:31:47,530
I can handle myself, okay, Mrs. West-Allen.

668
00:31:53,371 --> 00:31:55,538
I love you.

669
00:31:58,677 --> 00:32:00,143
I love you too.

670
00:32:00,145 --> 00:32:01,744
Lawton, let's move.

671
00:32:01,746 --> 00:32:03,913
Yeah, uh...

672
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,219
We need to work on finding Jesse.

673
00:32:10,221 --> 00:32:11,754
Are you sure this is what
you want to be doing?

674
00:32:11,756 --> 00:32:12,989
I am, all right?

675
00:32:12,991 --> 00:32:14,824
Right now, we have to help Iris.

676
00:32:14,826 --> 00:32:16,359
Just make sure no one else gets hurt.

677
00:32:36,381 --> 00:32:38,514
CCPD! It's over, Fells!

678
00:32:38,516 --> 00:32:40,817
No offense to you boys in blue,

679
00:32:40,819 --> 00:32:42,585
but I'm waiting on the man in red.

680
00:32:42,587 --> 00:32:44,153
You better hope The Flash doesn't show up,

681
00:32:44,155 --> 00:32:45,221
or you're finished.

682
00:32:45,223 --> 00:32:46,622
See, that's funny.

683
00:32:46,624 --> 00:32:48,257
I don't think he will show.

684
00:32:48,259 --> 00:32:50,927
I've been causing tremors for days

685
00:32:50,929 --> 00:32:52,895
and no sign of him.

686
00:32:52,897 --> 00:32:55,631
I think he's gone.

687
00:32:55,633 --> 00:32:59,035
What is it they say in boxing?

688
00:32:59,037 --> 00:33:02,071
Let's get ready to rumble.

689
00:33:08,213 --> 00:33:10,179
What the...

690
00:33:12,817 --> 00:33:14,817
I heard you were looking for The Flash.

691
00:33:14,819 --> 00:33:16,753
Looks like the Velocity-7 is working.

692
00:33:16,755 --> 00:33:18,421
Now, go get him.

693
00:33:23,328 --> 00:33:25,027
That's a new one.

694
00:33:25,029 --> 00:33:26,963
Is that all you have?

695
00:33:26,965 --> 00:33:31,200
You don't ever want to see all I have.

696
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:39,041
The Velocity-7's wearing off.

697
00:33:41,312 --> 00:33:42,979
You've heard what an eight
on the Richter scale

698
00:33:42,981 --> 00:33:45,081
can do to a city.

699
00:33:45,083 --> 00:33:48,785
Imagine what it's gonna do to your skull.

700
00:33:59,597 --> 00:34:01,397
You hurt?

701
00:34:01,399 --> 00:34:03,299
My pride

702
00:34:03,301 --> 00:34:05,001
and my body.

703
00:34:05,003 --> 00:34:07,236
Pride and my body.

704
00:34:21,019 --> 00:34:23,386
You really sure this is the place?

705
00:34:23,388 --> 00:34:26,756
Maybe you should stay in the car, Lawton.

706
00:34:26,758 --> 00:34:29,892
Look alive, gents.

707
00:34:42,173 --> 00:34:44,807
Hey, maybe... maybe your snitch was wrong.

708
00:34:44,809 --> 00:34:47,043
I mean, maybe they're not even here.

709
00:34:54,018 --> 00:34:55,751
No, they're here.

710
00:35:00,225 --> 00:35:03,526
You didn't knock.

711
00:35:03,528 --> 00:35:05,094
How rude.

712
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:09,765
Drop 'em.

713
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:21,244
Ronnie.

714
00:35:21,246 --> 00:35:23,946
Is Martin Stein in there?

715
00:35:23,948 --> 00:35:26,215
Oh, I haven't let him out in years.

716
00:35:26,217 --> 00:35:27,984
Doesn't talk much anymore.

717
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,053
You killed my father, you evil bitch.

718
00:35:31,055 --> 00:35:32,455
He shouldn't have palled around

719
00:35:32,457 --> 00:35:33,523
with a breacher.

720
00:35:33,525 --> 00:35:34,590
That's a big no-no as far

721
00:35:34,592 --> 00:35:36,425
as Zoom's concerned.

722
00:35:36,427 --> 00:35:38,160
I can't believe you two work for Zoom.

723
00:35:38,162 --> 00:35:42,031
No, they work for me.

724
00:35:42,033 --> 00:35:43,566
I work for Zoom.

725
00:35:47,739 --> 00:35:51,507
Who the hell are you?

726
00:35:54,112 --> 00:35:56,012
Well, that's funny.

727
00:35:56,014 --> 00:35:59,115
I was just gonna ask you the same thing.

728
00:36:02,387 --> 00:36:04,420
- Doppel...
- Ganger.

729
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,375
What the hell is going on here?

730
00:36:11,743 --> 00:36:13,109
Are you two related to each other?

731
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,526
Oh, I knew there was another me here.

732
00:36:15,091 --> 00:36:16,825
And I knew you were coming, Cisco,

733
00:36:16,827 --> 00:36:18,726
even before you entered the breach

734
00:36:18,728 --> 00:36:20,228
and set foot on this world.

735
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:24,232
See, we're all connected...

736
00:36:24,234 --> 00:36:25,834
Francisco.

737
00:36:25,836 --> 00:36:27,735
My name is Vibe.

738
00:36:27,737 --> 00:36:30,305
Reverb.

739
00:36:30,307 --> 00:36:32,974
Actually not the worst name
you could've come up with,

740
00:36:32,976 --> 00:36:35,009
but not the best.

741
00:36:36,713 --> 00:36:39,681
I've been watching you, Vibe,

742
00:36:39,683 --> 00:36:42,717
and I have to say
I am extremely disappointed.

743
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:44,586
Yeah, I know the feeling.

744
00:36:44,588 --> 00:36:46,287
I'm not sure what's worse,

745
00:36:46,289 --> 00:36:47,589
the fact that you're part of Zoom's gang,

746
00:36:47,591 --> 00:36:49,657
or that weird samurai situation

747
00:36:49,659 --> 00:36:51,192
you got going on on the top
of your head there.

748
00:36:51,194 --> 00:36:54,062
Listen to this.

749
00:36:54,064 --> 00:36:56,865
What if Zoom

750
00:36:56,867 --> 00:36:58,800
wasn't running the show anymore?

751
00:36:58,802 --> 00:37:00,935
What do you mean?

752
00:37:00,937 --> 00:37:03,071
You don't even know how powerful you are.

753
00:37:03,073 --> 00:37:05,039
All you use your powers for

754
00:37:05,041 --> 00:37:07,175
are these cheap parlor tricks

755
00:37:07,177 --> 00:37:11,279
when you... you could be a god.

756
00:37:11,281 --> 00:37:13,848
We could be gods.

757
00:37:19,789 --> 00:37:22,257
Are you Cloud City Vadering me right now?

758
00:37:22,259 --> 00:37:25,927
Are you out of your mind?

759
00:37:25,929 --> 00:37:29,097
Let's turn them over to Zoom.

760
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:30,598
Speak to me like that again,

761
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,600
and I will shatter
your entire nervous system

762
00:37:32,602 --> 00:37:34,569
without breaking a sweat.

763
00:37:36,406 --> 00:37:41,276
So, Vibe...

764
00:37:41,278 --> 00:37:44,078
Do you want to run Central City?

765
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,813
What do you say?

766
00:37:48,151 --> 00:37:50,652
I say...

767
00:37:50,654 --> 00:37:52,420
Flash, save us!

768
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,126
Hey, that didn't hurt you, did it?

769
00:37:58,128 --> 00:37:59,427
- No. Why would it?
- I don't know.

770
00:37:59,429 --> 00:38:00,995
And who the hell are you?

771
00:38:00,997 --> 00:38:03,097
Look, Detective,
just get out of here, all right?

772
00:38:03,099 --> 00:38:04,732
No, not without them.

773
00:38:15,378 --> 00:38:17,211
Stay here!

774
00:38:19,449 --> 00:38:20,882
Round two.

775
00:38:22,319 --> 00:38:24,419
Look, mirror-mirror, I already told you

776
00:38:24,432 --> 00:38:25,831
I'm not going to the dark side with you.

777
00:38:34,175 --> 00:38:35,474
You're a rotten shot.

778
00:38:39,413 --> 00:38:40,913
I'm not.

779
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:44,450
Are you telling me I can do that?

780
00:38:44,452 --> 00:38:45,384
I can show you.

781
00:38:53,327 --> 00:38:54,526
No!

782
00:39:03,971 --> 00:39:05,204
Stop, both of you!

783
00:39:05,206 --> 00:39:06,672
Zoom wanted him alive.

784
00:39:06,674 --> 00:39:08,273
You know what Zoom will do

785
00:39:08,275 --> 00:39:09,708
if you don't obey him.

786
00:39:12,646 --> 00:39:15,414
No!

787
00:39:15,416 --> 00:39:17,316
That.

788
00:39:19,553 --> 00:39:24,189
What did I say you should do

789
00:39:24,191 --> 00:39:27,026
if you encountered a speedster?

790
00:39:27,028 --> 00:39:29,728
Leave him unharmed.

791
00:39:31,365 --> 00:39:37,069
Does this look unharmed to you?

792
00:39:48,883 --> 00:39:53,819
I'm happy to see at least one of you

793
00:39:53,821 --> 00:39:56,789
knows their place.

794
00:40:02,797 --> 00:40:04,163
Barry!

795
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,699
No.

796
00:40:10,171 --> 00:40:11,637
No.

797
00:40:24,251 --> 00:40:25,918
Sorry.

798
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,120
Did I forget to say this might sting?

799
00:40:28,122 --> 00:40:30,522
It's not my first road rash.

800
00:40:30,524 --> 00:40:32,758
I'm a speedster, remember?

801
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,427
You made sure no one will forget that today.

802
00:40:35,429 --> 00:40:37,196
Thanks to you.

803
00:40:37,198 --> 00:40:39,064
The Velocity-7 held up pretty well.

804
00:40:39,066 --> 00:40:40,466
Moving on to Velocity-8.

805
00:40:40,468 --> 00:40:43,302
I'm gonna figure it out, I swear.

806
00:40:43,304 --> 00:40:46,405
I just need you to figure out
how to re-stabilize the breach.

807
00:40:46,407 --> 00:40:49,808
Barry, Cisco, and Wells
still have 24 hours to go.

808
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:52,244
So we have one day,

809
00:40:52,246 --> 00:40:54,346
or they could be stuck there forever.

810
00:41:25,846 --> 00:41:27,646
Jesse. Jesse!

811
00:41:27,648 --> 00:41:29,982
Hey. I'm here with your dad!

812
00:41:29,984 --> 00:41:31,683
We're gonna get you out of here, all right?

813
00:41:31,685 --> 00:41:33,318
I promise.

814
00:41:35,055 --> 00:41:37,856
It's not wise

815
00:41:37,858 --> 00:41:44,062
to make promises you can't keep, Flash.

816
00:41:44,064 --> 00:41:47,232
Look around.

817
00:41:47,234 --> 00:41:53,372
This is the last place

818
00:41:53,374 --> 00:41:56,575
you'll ever see.

819
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,527
