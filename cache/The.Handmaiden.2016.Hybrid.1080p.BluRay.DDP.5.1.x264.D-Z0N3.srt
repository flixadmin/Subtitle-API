1
00:01:15,727 --> 00:01:18,727
You little brats, beat it!

2
00:01:24,647 --> 00:01:25,647
Hey...!

3
00:01:59,567 --> 00:02:01,817
It should have been me!

4
00:02:01,817 --> 00:02:07,727
I should be the one
going to that Jap's house.

5
00:02:09,437 --> 00:02:11,437
You'll miss the train.

6
00:02:12,567 --> 00:02:13,607
Hurry.

7
00:02:21,607 --> 00:02:26,397
PART ONE

8
00:02:46,147 --> 00:02:48,227
<i>'Kouzuki Noriaki'</i>

9
00:02:56,067 --> 00:02:58,067
Go back to sleep.

10
00:02:58,067 --> 00:03:00,107
We're still far from the house.

11
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:33,777
Pleased to meet you.
I am Okju.

12
00:03:33,777 --> 00:03:35,607
This property has
three buildings.

13
00:03:35,607 --> 00:03:37,777
A Western-style wing
by an English architect

14
00:03:37,777 --> 00:03:40,777
and a Japanese wing
form the main house.

15
00:03:41,437 --> 00:03:45,277
Not even in Japan is there
a building combining two styles.

16
00:03:45,937 --> 00:03:51,777
It reflects Master's
admiration for Japan and England.

17
00:03:52,937 --> 00:03:54,607
Next is the annex

18
00:03:54,607 --> 00:03:57,437
which Master
had furnished as a library.

19
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:59,187
Last, the servants' quarters.

20
00:03:59,187 --> 00:04:01,607
As the Lady's handmaiden,
you won't sleep there.

21
00:04:02,277 --> 00:04:04,527
You may eat her leftover food,

22
00:04:04,527 --> 00:04:06,687
but tea leaves go
to the kitchen girls.

23
00:04:07,107 --> 00:04:09,357
Used soap
is for the steward.

24
00:04:09,687 --> 00:04:12,437
Anyone caught pilfering
is expelled that day.

25
00:04:12,437 --> 00:04:14,527
I'm sure you wouldn't dare,
Tamako.

26
00:04:16,687 --> 00:04:20,937
"Tamako" is you.
Your name Okju in Japanese.

27
00:04:21,687 --> 00:04:24,187
- Call me Sasaki.
- Yes, ma'am.

28
00:04:28,687 --> 00:04:34,687
The Lady's routine is simple.
Taking a walk, or reading for Master.

29
00:04:36,107 --> 00:04:40,187
Among the richest men,
Master is the greatest book lover.

30
00:04:40,187 --> 00:04:43,187
And among book lovers,
he is the richest.

31
00:04:43,187 --> 00:04:46,357
His ties to the colonial government
even let us use electricity.

32
00:04:46,357 --> 00:04:47,527
In such a home,

33
00:04:49,357 --> 00:04:52,437
you know what's expected
of a maid like you?

34
00:04:55,857 --> 00:04:58,027
Don't be alarmed at the blackouts.

35
00:05:23,227 --> 00:05:24,317
I sleep in here?

36
00:05:26,227 --> 00:05:29,147
Miss Hideko wakes easily
on account of her nerves.

37
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,067
She's behind this door?

38
00:06:07,277 --> 00:06:08,727
Mother!

39
00:06:13,397 --> 00:06:14,607
Mother!

40
00:06:15,727 --> 00:06:17,727
Mother!

41
00:06:19,227 --> 00:06:20,067
Miss!

42
00:06:20,397 --> 00:06:22,397
Miss, are you alright?

43
00:06:22,937 --> 00:06:24,727
Junko! Is that you?

44
00:06:25,477 --> 00:06:29,227
Junko was kicked out, Miss.
I'm the new girl.

45
00:06:29,227 --> 00:06:31,727
Seems you had a bad dream.

46
00:06:32,477 --> 00:06:35,227
You see that big cherry tree?

47
00:06:35,897 --> 00:06:39,727
My aunt went mad
and hanged herself there.

48
00:06:41,147 --> 00:06:43,227
Sometimes on moonless nights,

49
00:06:43,227 --> 00:06:45,107
my aunt's ghost

50
00:06:45,107 --> 00:06:48,727
dangles from that branch.

51
00:07:01,227 --> 00:07:03,067
Here, drink up.

52
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:12,107
When babies cry, my auntie
feeds them a spoonful of sake.

53
00:07:16,897 --> 00:07:20,777
<i>Sweet bird, sweet bird</i>

54
00:07:21,477 --> 00:07:24,437
<i>My sweet bluebird</i>

55
00:07:28,567 --> 00:07:34,567
<i>What scent is this,
that fills my nose?</i>

56
00:07:36,067 --> 00:07:41,107
<i>You think I'm Tamako,
a poor Korean handmaiden.</i>

57
00:07:41,107 --> 00:07:44,477
<i>But my real name's
Nam Sookee.</i>

58
00:07:44,477 --> 00:07:50,777
<i>Raised by Miss Boksun,
top purveyor of stolen goods.</i>

59
00:07:50,777 --> 00:07:55,067
<i>I was able at age 5 to tell
a real coin from a fake.</i>

60
00:07:55,067 --> 00:07:58,227
<i>Then learned to forge stamps
from Gugai,</i>

61
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:01,937
<i>and studied pickpocketing
from Kutan,</i>

62
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:05,937
<i>but these babies will never
learn such useful skills.</i>

63
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:09,107
<i>Abandoned as newborns,</i>

64
00:08:09,107 --> 00:08:12,607
<i>we'll wash and feed them,
then sell them to Japan.</i>

65
00:08:12,607 --> 00:08:14,607
<i>Such meaningful work.</i>

66
00:08:14,607 --> 00:08:19,107
<i>Instead of starving, they grow up
gentlemen and ladies.</i>

67
00:08:19,937 --> 00:08:25,107
<i>Kutan only breastfeeds her own kid.
I wouldn't be so miserly.</i>

68
00:08:25,107 --> 00:08:30,437
<i>I wish my breasts gave milk.
I'd breastfeed all of them.</i>

69
00:09:11,027 --> 00:09:14,437
I'll tell you the story
of an interpreter,

70
00:09:15,357 --> 00:09:20,527
who bribed his way into
translating for high officials.

71
00:09:20,857 --> 00:09:24,857
After helping Japan annex Korea,
he got rights to a gold mine.

72
00:09:26,027 --> 00:09:29,027
Now he wants to turn
fully Japanese.

73
00:09:29,857 --> 00:09:31,857
So he gets naturalized,

74
00:09:33,027 --> 00:09:36,187
marries the daughter
of a fallen Japanese noble,

75
00:09:36,687 --> 00:09:40,527
and adopts his wife's
family name Kouzuki.

76
00:09:41,187 --> 00:09:44,857
Ba... Bas...

77
00:09:45,687 --> 00:09:50,687
Bastard builds a mansion,
fills it with books and antiques.

78
00:09:52,527 --> 00:09:56,357
He invites Japanese collectors
to his library,

79
00:09:56,357 --> 00:10:00,687
holds readings of rare books,
and auctions the books off.

80
00:10:00,687 --> 00:10:03,687
He loves books and paintings
like his own flesh,

81
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:05,607
but he can't help
parting with a few.

82
00:10:05,607 --> 00:10:09,277
What to do, when he must sell,
but can't bear to?

83
00:10:09,277 --> 00:10:11,187
He sells a fake.

84
00:10:14,027 --> 00:10:19,527
He seeks out a specialist
to create intricate forgeries.

85
00:10:19,527 --> 00:10:21,687
Unlike him this specialist...

86
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:24,437
is a real Japanese,
of noble birth!

87
00:10:26,187 --> 00:10:29,437
Count Fujiwara from Nagoya.

88
00:10:30,777 --> 00:10:34,027
So, who is this?

89
00:10:35,357 --> 00:10:38,357
It's the wife.
His Japanese wife.

90
00:10:39,527 --> 00:10:42,277
- You'll seduce her...
- Is she pretty?

91
00:10:42,277 --> 00:10:45,187
The Jap wife died ages ago
with no children.

92
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:50,357
But the dead wife's
dead sister's living daughter

93
00:10:50,357 --> 00:10:51,857
performs those book readings.

94
00:10:51,857 --> 00:10:53,027
But is she pretty?

95
00:10:53,607 --> 00:10:56,437
An orphan.
Her father was rich.

96
00:10:56,437 --> 00:11:00,437
Soon she'll fall in love with me,
and we'll elope to Japan.

97
00:11:00,437 --> 00:11:02,477
After marrying her there,

98
00:11:02,477 --> 00:11:06,817
and inheriting her fortune,
I'll declare her insane

99
00:11:06,817 --> 00:11:09,027
and lock her up in a madhouse.

100
00:11:09,027 --> 00:11:09,727
Right!

101
00:11:11,277 --> 00:11:18,777
Sookee will be my mouse,
work as her maid, eavesdrop on her,

102
00:11:19,317 --> 00:11:24,437
stay by her side and gently
persuade her to fall in love.

103
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:25,817
<i>Love?</i>

104
00:11:26,647 --> 00:11:28,937
<i>What does a crook
know about love?</i>

105
00:11:34,357 --> 00:11:37,477
What of her fortune?
She's rich?

106
00:11:38,107 --> 00:11:41,937
Each night in bed I think
of her assets.

107
00:11:42,437 --> 00:11:45,477
1.5 million in cash.
300,000 in bonds.

108
00:11:48,527 --> 00:11:51,897
The uncle is just a guardian.
It's Hideko's fortune.

109
00:11:51,897 --> 00:11:55,727
That's why Kouzuki
schemes to marry the girl.

110
00:11:56,647 --> 00:11:58,567
To his w...wife's niece?

111
00:11:58,567 --> 00:11:59,937
What a s...sick f...f...

112
00:11:59,937 --> 00:12:01,567
Right, a sick fuck.

113
00:12:03,397 --> 00:12:05,607
So what's our share?

114
00:12:07,317 --> 00:12:09,067
I'll share 50,000.

115
00:12:09,067 --> 00:12:11,107
Sookee gets the
dresses and jewellery.

116
00:12:11,937 --> 00:12:13,977
I'll do it! Take me!

117
00:12:13,977 --> 00:12:17,397
My Japanese is better,
and I worked as a maid!

118
00:12:30,897 --> 00:12:32,567
On top of the fifty,

119
00:12:34,727 --> 00:12:38,647
I get dresses, jewellery
and my own 100,000.

120
00:12:39,107 --> 00:12:40,647
She must be crazy...

121
00:12:41,777 --> 00:12:43,817
<i>Crazy? Not a bit.</i>

122
00:12:44,727 --> 00:12:47,317
<i>I'll take my fortune
and flee this country.</i>

123
00:12:48,937 --> 00:12:52,607
<i>Endure these country yokels
a bit longer.</i>

124
00:13:09,567 --> 00:13:11,567
Those fuckers.

125
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:15,437
This is Tamako.

126
00:13:15,437 --> 00:13:18,397
I am at your service.
Miss...

127
00:13:20,437 --> 00:13:21,477
<i>Bloody hell.</i>

128
00:13:23,727 --> 00:13:26,317
<i>He should've told me
she was so pretty.</i>

129
00:13:26,977 --> 00:13:28,937
<i>I'm completely flummoxed.</i>

130
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:31,607
A reference letter

131
00:13:31,607 --> 00:13:34,567
from Lady Minami,
my last mistress.

132
00:13:36,727 --> 00:13:39,607
Here's the letter.
Pay attention.

133
00:13:42,067 --> 00:13:44,107
"Dear Miss Izumi Hideko,

134
00:13:44,107 --> 00:13:49,567
Count Fujiwara has informed me
of your urgent need for a maid.

135
00:13:49,567 --> 00:13:52,897
A maid is like
a pair of chopsticks.

136
00:13:52,897 --> 00:13:57,567
Her presence is little noted, but
her absence causes much distress."

137
00:13:59,107 --> 00:14:01,437
So is this place to your liking?

138
00:14:02,937 --> 00:14:05,777
The sun scarcely ever shines here.

139
00:14:05,777 --> 00:14:08,107
Uncle won't permit it.

140
00:14:08,107 --> 00:14:11,277
Sunlight causes books to fade.

141
00:14:11,277 --> 00:14:13,937
One could never grow fond
of such a dreary place.

142
00:14:18,937 --> 00:14:21,437
Not a good liar, are you?

143
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:24,437
I'll take my leave.

144
00:14:38,437 --> 00:14:41,437
My head aches before
every reading practice.

145
00:14:44,607 --> 00:14:45,777
Would you read it to me?

146
00:14:47,277 --> 00:14:48,277
Pardon?

147
00:14:58,107 --> 00:14:59,357
Oh, how kind of her.

148
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:03,357
Lady Minami said such
nice things about me!

149
00:15:03,357 --> 00:15:04,357
Is that so?

150
00:15:07,687 --> 00:15:12,527
You're a Japanese lady,
why don't you speak Japanese?

151
00:15:13,107 --> 00:15:14,357
I'm sick of it.

152
00:15:14,357 --> 00:15:17,357
The books he makes me read
are all Japanese.

153
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,437
So read that for me.

154
00:15:32,437 --> 00:15:34,687
"Dear Miss Izumi Hideko,

155
00:15:35,687 --> 00:15:39,527
Count Fujiwara said
you're looking for a maid.

156
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:42,527
Maids are like...

157
00:15:42,527 --> 00:15:44,437
a spoon... no...

158
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,527
are like chopsticks...

159
00:15:52,357 --> 00:15:54,527
Is it a spoon?

160
00:16:03,727 --> 00:16:05,727
I don't know how to read, Miss.

161
00:16:08,357 --> 00:16:11,277
Not at all?
What about Korean?

162
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:38,647
This is your name.
Can't you read it?

163
00:16:45,067 --> 00:16:47,227
Reading can be learned,

164
00:16:47,227 --> 00:16:50,147
and I don't care if you
curse or steal.

165
00:16:53,187 --> 00:16:55,687
But don't ever lie to me.
Understood?

166
00:16:56,107 --> 00:16:57,147
Yes, Miss.

167
00:17:02,317 --> 00:17:04,277
My mum.

168
00:17:06,107 --> 00:17:09,437
She's beautiful,
quite the charmer!

169
00:17:09,437 --> 00:17:12,067
And me?
Am I "quite the charmer?"

170
00:17:14,227 --> 00:17:17,277
Everyone says I can't
compare to my mother.

171
00:17:21,317 --> 00:17:23,727
Count Fujiwara said...

172
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:26,897
So you've met the Count?

173
00:17:26,897 --> 00:17:27,897
Pardon?

174
00:17:27,897 --> 00:17:29,897
No, I never met him...

175
00:17:30,477 --> 00:17:33,477
My aunt!
I heard it from my aunt.

176
00:17:33,477 --> 00:17:35,477
She was his nanny.

177
00:17:36,227 --> 00:17:38,277
What did the Count
say about me?

178
00:17:40,397 --> 00:17:42,397
He said your face...

179
00:17:43,567 --> 00:17:47,567
Every night in bed he thinks
of your assets... your face.

180
00:17:50,897 --> 00:17:52,897
Why in bed, I wonder?

181
00:17:56,897 --> 00:17:58,777
What's with your foot?

182
00:18:05,067 --> 00:18:07,107
I've nowhere to go.

183
00:18:07,817 --> 00:18:11,147
I've just stayed in this house
since coming to Korea at age 5.

184
00:18:13,067 --> 00:18:17,067
But in new shoes, even
well-trodden paths feel fresh.

185
00:18:17,817 --> 00:18:19,147
The ones from here

186
00:18:20,067 --> 00:18:22,107
up to here
should fit you.

187
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:30,567
Time for reading practice.

188
00:18:31,567 --> 00:18:32,567
I'll go alone.

189
00:18:32,567 --> 00:18:33,777
Miss?

190
00:18:33,777 --> 00:18:34,817
But rain is falling.

191
00:18:51,147 --> 00:18:55,227
At noon, come knock
on the door. Promise?

192
00:18:59,107 --> 00:19:00,107
See you at...

193
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:03,107
See you later.

194
00:19:10,777 --> 00:19:11,937
What's this?

195
00:19:52,937 --> 00:19:56,277
<i>Why would the lady
of such a big house...?</i>

196
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:06,777
<i>Did the big house
make her go mad?</i>

197
00:20:45,607 --> 00:20:47,437
My new handmaiden.

198
00:20:48,437 --> 00:20:49,437
The snake, the snake!

199
00:20:56,607 --> 00:20:58,527
You mustn't pass that point.

200
00:20:59,027 --> 00:21:00,437
Be warned!

201
00:21:01,357 --> 00:21:04,027
The snake marks the
'bounds of knowledge'.

202
00:21:12,357 --> 00:21:13,527
<i>A snake!</i>

203
00:21:18,107 --> 00:21:19,357
The Count?

204
00:21:20,357 --> 00:21:21,357
Today?

205
00:21:25,027 --> 00:21:27,527
That's why you insisted
on a bath.

206
00:21:27,527 --> 00:21:30,357
My aunt, when she heard
a guest was coming,

207
00:21:30,357 --> 00:21:33,187
dropped everything and
bathed her Baby Miss.

208
00:21:33,857 --> 00:21:38,437
Nothing made her happier than when
guests praised her baby's scent.

209
00:21:39,527 --> 00:21:42,607
You are my Baby Miss.

210
00:21:44,357 --> 00:21:47,187
Auntie gave the babies
candy during baths.

211
00:21:47,187 --> 00:21:50,027
To teach them that
bath time is sweet.

212
00:21:50,027 --> 00:21:51,687
What's wrong?

213
00:21:53,027 --> 00:21:56,527
One of my teeth is sharp.
It keeps cutting me.

214
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,107
<i>So this was the scent.</i>

215
00:23:42,567 --> 00:23:43,647
All smooth.

216
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:00,817
Welcome, sir!

217
00:24:10,227 --> 00:24:14,567
You are too kind to greet me
this way upon my arrival,

218
00:24:14,567 --> 00:24:17,897
when the journey has
left me so unkempt.

219
00:24:17,897 --> 00:24:19,647
Now your tedium is over.

220
00:24:19,647 --> 00:24:23,897
I'll ensure your painting
lessons are stimulating.

221
00:24:27,067 --> 00:24:28,437
This must be Okju.

222
00:24:28,437 --> 00:24:31,107
At your service, milord.

223
00:24:31,977 --> 00:24:35,897
You know if you fail, it'll put
me in an awkward position?

224
00:24:37,897 --> 00:24:41,817
A decent bone structure
for a Korean...

225
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:46,567
So, are you carrying out
your duties faithfully?

226
00:25:00,107 --> 00:25:03,937
Count Fujiwara asks Miss Hideko
to kindly allow her maid Tamako

227
00:25:03,937 --> 00:25:06,937
to be sent to his Lordship
for a brief errand.

228
00:25:15,107 --> 00:25:17,777
Did you call for me, milord?

229
00:25:17,777 --> 00:25:18,777
You may enter.

230
00:25:50,437 --> 00:25:52,437
Everyone's talking
about you in Eunpo.

231
00:25:52,937 --> 00:25:55,937
How you'll be an even
greater thief than your mum.

232
00:25:56,277 --> 00:25:58,687
Who believes the talk
of a swindler?

233
00:25:59,857 --> 00:26:03,357
"fully ripe",

234
00:26:03,357 --> 00:26:05,527
arrange for her and I
to be alone.

235
00:26:05,527 --> 00:26:07,527
Then I'll gobble her up
to the pit.

236
00:26:07,527 --> 00:26:11,857
She's so naive,
even if a man pulls on her nipples

237
00:26:11,857 --> 00:26:13,187
she won't know what he wants.

238
00:26:14,937 --> 00:26:16,527
So it's your job to tell her

239
00:26:16,527 --> 00:26:19,607
that everything
is because of me.

240
00:26:20,187 --> 00:26:23,027
"Oh my,
since the Count arrived,

241
00:26:23,027 --> 00:26:26,027
your toenails
are growing much faster!"

242
00:26:26,027 --> 00:26:28,187
That sort of thing, all right?

243
00:26:29,527 --> 00:26:30,527
Here, a gift.

244
00:26:42,687 --> 00:26:45,357
Oh, he's so thoughtful!

245
00:26:46,687 --> 00:26:49,687
<i>That'll be mine when
she goes to the madhouse.</i>

246
00:26:50,527 --> 00:26:54,027
<i>It pains my heart
to see this poor girl.</i>

247
00:26:54,027 --> 00:26:56,937
Have you ever seen
sapphires so blue?

248
00:26:59,567 --> 00:27:02,567
Let's take a look...

249
00:27:04,107 --> 00:27:07,897
This isn't a sapphire,
it's blue spinel.

250
00:27:10,607 --> 00:27:13,607
It's all right, Miss.
Spinels are expensive too.

251
00:27:14,317 --> 00:27:15,727
How do you know...?

252
00:27:16,607 --> 00:27:21,027
Oh, my Auntie... I mean,
Lady Minami taught me.

253
00:27:21,777 --> 00:27:23,357
But it's fine!

254
00:27:23,357 --> 00:27:25,027
No need to be
ashamed at all.

255
00:27:25,027 --> 00:27:27,607
Your average fence
can barely tell them apart.

256
00:27:27,607 --> 00:27:29,147
Is that so?

257
00:27:43,317 --> 00:27:46,397
<i>Of all the things
I've washed and dressed,</i>

258
00:27:46,937 --> 00:27:49,357
<i>has anything been this pretty?</i>

259
00:27:51,357 --> 00:27:54,027
<i>I'd like to show her to
the people at home.</i>

260
00:27:55,277 --> 00:27:56,317
<i>What would they say?</i>

261
00:27:58,897 --> 00:28:00,477
<i>Probably this?</i>

262
00:28:03,727 --> 00:28:04,727
Mesmerising!

263
00:28:04,727 --> 00:28:08,727
S...Spellbindingly beautiful!

264
00:28:15,147 --> 00:28:17,067
<i>He's shameless.</i>

265
00:28:19,437 --> 00:28:22,647
B...b...beautiful!

266
00:28:22,647 --> 00:28:25,647
I...I...I'm flummoxed
in your presence!

267
00:28:26,067 --> 00:28:30,897
If you stutter like that
and make your face go red,

268
00:28:30,897 --> 00:28:33,227
those uppity bitches
will feel superior,

269
00:28:33,227 --> 00:28:36,227
and then they'll open
up to you, all right?

270
00:28:37,647 --> 00:28:38,647
You try it.

271
00:28:42,067 --> 00:28:44,817
One, two, three!

272
00:28:47,107 --> 00:28:51,107
The Count kept pushing
wine on me.

273
00:28:58,227 --> 00:28:59,567
Does it feel okay?

274
00:29:00,107 --> 00:29:03,437
It's suffocating.
How do ladies wear such things?

275
00:29:04,227 --> 00:29:05,647
You think this is suffocating?

276
00:29:07,567 --> 00:29:09,607
Miss, you're killing me!

277
00:29:12,977 --> 00:29:15,777
Dressed up,
you look like a lady, too.

278
00:29:20,607 --> 00:29:22,277
I think I know

279
00:29:23,777 --> 00:29:25,777
what the Count meant.

280
00:29:27,567 --> 00:29:29,227
Your face...

281
00:29:30,607 --> 00:29:32,437
Each night in bed,

282
00:29:33,607 --> 00:29:35,647
I think of your face.

283
00:29:39,067 --> 00:29:40,727
Don't be silly, Miss.

284
00:29:46,397 --> 00:29:51,647
<i>Ladies truly are
the dolls of maids.</i>

285
00:29:52,277 --> 00:29:56,727
<i>All these buttons
are for my amusement.</i>

286
00:29:57,607 --> 00:30:00,317
<i>If I undo the buttons
and pull out the cords,</i>

287
00:30:01,727 --> 00:30:04,897
<i>then, the sweet things within,</i>

288
00:30:05,727 --> 00:30:08,477
<i>those sweet and soft things...</i>

289
00:30:10,437 --> 00:30:15,067
<i>If I were still a pickpocket
I'd slip my hand inside...</i>

290
00:30:48,227 --> 00:30:51,937
Miss, are you truly
going to marry your uncle?

291
00:30:55,647 --> 00:30:59,937
That's what he raised me for,
knowing he'd need my fortune.

292
00:31:00,607 --> 00:31:02,937
There's a famous collector
in France.

293
00:31:02,937 --> 00:31:06,437
He'll be putting his entire
library up for auction.

294
00:31:06,437 --> 00:31:09,437
The gold mine's proceeds
won't cover the cost.

295
00:31:10,437 --> 00:31:15,607
If it were me, I'd sell books
to buy gold, not the opposite.

296
00:31:49,777 --> 00:31:50,937
<i>For now,</i>

297
00:31:51,607 --> 00:31:53,937
<i>the Lady needn't go read
to the sick fuck</i>

298
00:31:53,937 --> 00:31:56,147
<i>who wants to marry
his wife's niece.</i>

299
00:31:58,107 --> 00:32:02,857
<i>Instead the fake Count goes to
the Library to make fake books.</i>

300
00:32:06,277 --> 00:32:10,187
<i>The Lady waits for her
2 o'clock art class,</i>

301
00:32:10,187 --> 00:32:11,607
<i>and waits...</i>

302
00:32:13,937 --> 00:32:16,187
<i>Poor girl,</i>

303
00:32:16,187 --> 00:32:19,027
<i>losing her heart to a fake.</i>

304
00:32:53,437 --> 00:32:55,107
Please, Count!

305
00:33:47,187 --> 00:33:48,527
Sorry to be late.

306
00:33:49,357 --> 00:33:50,397
It's no matter.

307
00:33:58,727 --> 00:34:03,067
Maybe I need more practice
to give it dimensionality?

308
00:34:03,067 --> 00:34:05,647
Dimensionality... perhaps.

309
00:34:05,647 --> 00:34:09,647
Nonetheless, you have a vision
that transcends mere skill.

310
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:13,477
As if you see directly
into an object's essence.

311
00:34:13,897 --> 00:34:19,067
For example, the fact that this
peach contains a lot of water.

312
00:34:19,067 --> 00:34:21,727
I hesitate to stand before you,

313
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:24,277
for fear that you might
read my thoughts.

314
00:34:32,477 --> 00:34:34,437
That's enough for today.

315
00:34:40,727 --> 00:34:43,567
Almost fully ripe.

316
00:34:43,567 --> 00:34:44,567
<i>Already?</i>

317
00:34:49,227 --> 00:34:50,227
<i>Damn...</i>

318
00:34:54,397 --> 00:34:55,607
Do you know what?

319
00:34:55,607 --> 00:34:59,277
Since the Count arrived,
your cheeks have grown flushed.

320
00:34:59,277 --> 00:35:00,317
Have they?

321
00:35:06,817 --> 00:35:09,567
How did your mum die?

322
00:35:10,727 --> 00:35:15,817
When I was a baby, at a
big house, she was hanged...

323
00:35:15,817 --> 00:35:19,777
- I mean, she hanged...
- Hanged herself? Like my aunt.

324
00:35:20,437 --> 00:35:22,397
Well, pretty much.

325
00:35:29,897 --> 00:35:34,317
Still, while alive
she hugged you a lot?

326
00:35:38,727 --> 00:35:42,647
My mother died
giving birth to me.

327
00:35:43,897 --> 00:35:50,647
So it's as if
I strangled her myself.

328
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:55,357
I wish I'd never been born.

329
00:35:59,437 --> 00:36:02,437
No baby is ever guilty
of being born.

330
00:36:03,107 --> 00:36:05,437
If your mother thought you
could understand

331
00:36:05,437 --> 00:36:07,937
this is what she'd have said.

332
00:36:08,937 --> 00:36:13,107
That she was so lucky
to have you before dying.

333
00:36:13,107 --> 00:36:15,107
That she had no regrets.

334
00:36:20,777 --> 00:36:25,277
Did my mum cry
before they hanged her?

335
00:36:25,277 --> 00:36:28,777
Your mother stole
a thousand times,

336
00:36:28,777 --> 00:36:32,607
was caught just once,
and died once.

337
00:36:34,607 --> 00:36:35,937
Did she cry?

338
00:36:40,437 --> 00:36:41,607
She laughed.

339
00:36:42,607 --> 00:36:45,937
Said she was lucky
to have you before dying.

340
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:48,607
That she had no regrets.

341
00:36:54,937 --> 00:36:57,107
Wait here a moment, Miss.

342
00:36:58,027 --> 00:36:59,187
I'll go pick mushrooms.

343
00:37:01,357 --> 00:37:04,437
We'll have mushroom stew
tonight, you like that.

344
00:37:04,437 --> 00:37:06,187
I'll go with you.

345
00:37:07,027 --> 00:37:08,527
I'll be quick.

346
00:37:09,357 --> 00:37:10,857
Before it rains.

347
00:37:20,107 --> 00:37:21,107
Good girl...

348
00:37:27,027 --> 00:37:28,357
What a coincidence.

349
00:37:28,937 --> 00:37:29,527
Indeed.

350
00:37:30,357 --> 00:37:32,027
May I sit by you?

351
00:37:58,857 --> 00:38:01,857
<i>The lady sits, shy and trembling.</i>

352
00:38:01,857 --> 00:38:04,567
<i>The gentleman is persistent.</i>

353
00:38:05,227 --> 00:38:09,227
<i>The perceptive maid
has stepped out for a moment.</i>

354
00:38:10,277 --> 00:38:12,227
<i>All is well, Sookee.</i>

355
00:38:13,227 --> 00:38:16,397
<i>Everyone's performing
their roles so damned well.</i>

356
00:38:20,187 --> 00:38:21,227
<i>Fucking hell.</i>

357
00:38:24,817 --> 00:38:27,607
You know servants
can't use this entrance!

358
00:38:35,937 --> 00:38:37,147
Hey!

359
00:38:42,477 --> 00:38:45,107
<i>I wish I'd never come here.</i>

360
00:38:47,937 --> 00:38:49,977
<i>It was wrong to come.</i>

361
00:38:51,687 --> 00:38:54,727
Tamako, you brought
watercolours, right?

362
00:38:55,317 --> 00:38:57,317
Of course, milord!

363
00:38:57,317 --> 00:38:58,897
Watercolour paints and brushes...

364
00:38:58,897 --> 00:39:01,067
Go and get the oils.

365
00:39:01,067 --> 00:39:05,107
A day like this demands oils, yes!

366
00:39:49,477 --> 00:39:51,727
<i>A blackout!
Bring a lantern.</i>

367
00:39:52,277 --> 00:39:53,567
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

368
00:39:53,567 --> 00:39:54,567
<i>Hurry!</i>

369
00:39:59,727 --> 00:40:02,397
<i>I need to think.</i>

370
00:40:03,147 --> 00:40:05,397
<i>I need to become rich,</i>

371
00:40:05,397 --> 00:40:10,067
<i>sail off to a distant harbour,
eat food I scarcely recognise,</i>

372
00:40:10,067 --> 00:40:13,147
<i>buy my fill of
glittering baubles, and...</i>

373
00:40:13,147 --> 00:40:15,227
<i>not think of Hideko.</i>

374
00:40:16,397 --> 00:40:18,437
<i>Never think of Hideko...</i>

375
00:40:46,147 --> 00:40:48,647
I returned and you didn't
even come to me?

376
00:40:49,567 --> 00:40:52,317
It was late, I must have slept.
My apologies.

377
00:40:54,067 --> 00:40:56,777
You know how hard it is
to do those readings?

378
00:40:57,647 --> 00:41:00,977
Must I remove makeup and
change clothes all by myself?

379
00:41:01,817 --> 00:41:04,437
I feel a nightmare coming.
Sleep here.

380
00:41:29,777 --> 00:41:31,817
He proposed to me.

381
00:41:35,067 --> 00:41:36,727
Next full moon,

382
00:41:37,817 --> 00:41:42,567
when my uncle visits his mine,
he wants to elope to Japan.

383
00:41:44,817 --> 00:41:46,817
What did you say?

384
00:41:49,567 --> 00:41:51,397
I said I wasn't sure.

385
00:41:51,397 --> 00:41:52,437
Why?

386
00:41:53,067 --> 00:41:54,567
I'm scared.

387
00:41:55,227 --> 00:41:57,187
Of your uncle's anger?

388
00:41:58,937 --> 00:42:00,937
Of the Count.

389
00:42:02,607 --> 00:42:05,607
What's to be scared of?
He's so kind.

390
00:42:07,937 --> 00:42:10,777
I don't know, I just feel it.

391
00:42:14,107 --> 00:42:17,107
Like the reflex of pulling
your hand from a flame.

392
00:42:20,607 --> 00:42:22,607
Tell me...

393
00:42:30,437 --> 00:42:32,607
What is it that men want?

394
00:42:35,937 --> 00:42:36,937
Pardon?

395
00:42:38,277 --> 00:42:42,107
I mean after getting married,
at night...

396
00:42:45,607 --> 00:42:48,607
How would I know?
I'm practically a child.

397
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:52,607
With no mother.
No one here to...

398
00:42:58,607 --> 00:42:59,607
First,

399
00:43:01,857 --> 00:43:03,607
I guess we'd kiss?

400
00:43:05,937 --> 00:43:07,857
<i>What the hell.</i>

401
00:43:07,857 --> 00:43:10,107
<i>I'll show her one thing then
put her to bed.</i>

402
00:43:12,527 --> 00:43:13,607
<i>Poor thing,</i>

403
00:43:13,607 --> 00:43:20,357
<i>alone in a strange country,
reading those useless books,</i>

404
00:43:20,937 --> 00:43:23,687
<i>without learning
a single useful skill.</i>

405
00:43:41,187 --> 00:43:43,687
<i>Why does the candy
taste different?</i>

406
00:43:44,937 --> 00:43:48,187
<i>The bitter turned sour,</i>

407
00:43:48,187 --> 00:43:51,777
<i>the sour turned sweet,</i>

408
00:43:51,777 --> 00:43:55,277
<i>the sweet turned savoury...</i>

409
00:43:55,277 --> 00:43:57,277
How do you know all this?

410
00:43:58,277 --> 00:44:00,277
You must have experience?

411
00:44:02,567 --> 00:44:05,277
My friend Kutan taught me.

412
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:08,277
Taught you?
In words?

413
00:44:08,897 --> 00:44:10,897
Yes, only in words.

414
00:44:30,437 --> 00:44:32,477
So this is how it feels.

415
00:44:32,477 --> 00:44:35,067
That's what you will
feel for the Count.

416
00:44:36,317 --> 00:44:37,277
Really?

417
00:44:37,857 --> 00:44:39,647
The Count, truly...

418
00:44:42,607 --> 00:44:46,107
He won't think
he's making love to a corpse?

419
00:44:47,477 --> 00:44:50,477
You know about my
cold hands and feet.

420
00:44:50,477 --> 00:44:51,527
Really?

421
00:44:52,437 --> 00:44:53,477
Here.

422
00:45:02,067 --> 00:45:03,727
Feels just fine.

423
00:45:04,397 --> 00:45:05,437
You like it?

424
00:45:07,227 --> 00:45:10,227
Do it to me.
I want to know how it feels.

425
00:45:14,607 --> 00:45:18,567
I'm sure he'll want
to do this too.

426
00:45:19,397 --> 00:45:20,397
And then...

427
00:45:27,477 --> 00:45:29,317
It's so cute.

428
00:45:31,897 --> 00:45:34,067
If the Count sees this...

429
00:45:44,107 --> 00:45:47,107
Will he really be
so tender as this?

430
00:45:47,977 --> 00:45:49,397
Of course.

431
00:45:49,397 --> 00:45:52,397
And he'll touch you like this.

432
00:45:52,397 --> 00:45:54,397
And like this...

433
00:45:57,397 --> 00:46:00,277
Keep doing it
like the Count would.

434
00:46:02,777 --> 00:46:05,777
And this is what he'll say.

435
00:46:08,567 --> 00:46:11,567
It's so soft, warm,

436
00:46:13,567 --> 00:46:15,567
wet, and...

437
00:46:16,067 --> 00:46:20,567
s...s...spellbindingly beautiful!

438
00:46:40,567 --> 00:46:42,777
<i>Okju.</i>

439
00:46:44,317 --> 00:46:47,317
<i>Hideko.</i>

440
00:46:50,227 --> 00:46:52,727
<i>Mummy.</i>

441
00:46:54,397 --> 00:46:56,687
<i>Daddy.</i>

442
00:46:58,317 --> 00:47:00,937
Now, the model must stay still.

443
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:05,277
<i>Okju.</i>

444
00:47:09,437 --> 00:47:12,277
<i>- Hideko...</i>
- Wait.

445
00:47:13,107 --> 00:47:14,107
Stop!

446
00:47:15,277 --> 00:47:19,107
<i>...doesn't like it,
you damned scoundrel!</i>

447
00:47:20,777 --> 00:47:21,937
Stop it!

448
00:47:21,937 --> 00:47:23,107
I can't do this.

449
00:47:27,277 --> 00:47:28,777
Come here, Tamako.

450
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:34,277
Find some other job to do.

451
00:47:34,277 --> 00:47:35,937
You catch my meaning?

452
00:47:45,607 --> 00:47:47,607
I've no other job to do.

453
00:47:47,607 --> 00:47:50,937
My job is to
look after the Lady.

454
00:48:02,357 --> 00:48:05,527
I spit it out without chewing!
All because of you!

455
00:48:05,527 --> 00:48:07,527
She's fully ripe! Fully ripe!

456
00:48:07,527 --> 00:48:09,687
If I miss this fortnight,
I'm finished!

457
00:48:10,687 --> 00:48:13,107
Can you feel it?
How much I want it?

458
00:48:13,107 --> 00:48:17,687
After fighting so hard to escape
my garbage heap of a life,

459
00:48:18,187 --> 00:48:21,357
you think I'll let you
fuck it up, you bitch?

460
00:48:21,777 --> 00:48:26,937
Shall I tell the Lady you're
nothing but a lowly pickpocket?

461
00:48:26,937 --> 00:48:30,687
Fine, I'll have something
to tell her too.

462
00:48:30,687 --> 00:48:35,027
That you're nothing but the son of
a lowly Korean farmhand and shaman...

463
00:48:35,027 --> 00:48:36,027
Sookee.

464
00:48:36,027 --> 00:48:38,687
Think of your family at home.

465
00:48:38,687 --> 00:48:42,527
Boksun raising babies with her
bad back, and those two halfwits.

466
00:48:42,527 --> 00:48:45,187
How will they feel if
you go home empty-handed?

467
00:48:45,187 --> 00:48:47,107
Want to shit
on your mother's legend?

468
00:48:47,107 --> 00:48:49,357
You should go home in glory.

469
00:48:54,437 --> 00:48:58,227
So don't push Hideko too hard.

470
00:48:58,227 --> 00:48:59,567
She's got no one
on this earth.

471
00:48:59,567 --> 00:49:03,227
If you frighten her,
she'll close up hard as a clam.

472
00:49:05,857 --> 00:49:07,187
And please...

473
00:49:08,817 --> 00:49:14,317
Don't ever again put my hand
on your tiny joke of a cock.

474
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:23,607
Oh my.

475
00:49:24,397 --> 00:49:27,687
Your toenails have grown faster since
the Count arrived.

476
00:49:27,687 --> 00:49:29,567
How curious.

477
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:34,527
Miss, doesn't it bother you
not to know?

478
00:49:35,567 --> 00:49:38,727
How many ships sail
on the wide sea...

479
00:49:39,357 --> 00:49:41,817
People leaving,
people returning,

480
00:49:42,227 --> 00:49:44,937
those saying farewell
or welcome back.

481
00:49:44,937 --> 00:49:47,477
What's the farthest
you've travelled?

482
00:49:47,477 --> 00:49:49,027
The hill beyond the manor?

483
00:49:54,857 --> 00:49:58,897
I could be content here,
if you were with me.

484
00:50:00,357 --> 00:50:02,317
You're fortunate, Miss.

485
00:50:02,647 --> 00:50:06,647
The man who loves you
has the power to protect you.

486
00:50:06,647 --> 00:50:08,607
That's rare.

487
00:50:09,277 --> 00:50:13,277
But I'm not sure...
if I love him.

488
00:50:14,817 --> 00:50:16,357
You do love him.

489
00:50:19,687 --> 00:50:21,187
How do you know?

490
00:50:22,897 --> 00:50:25,277
You stare out the window all day.

491
00:50:26,107 --> 00:50:28,277
Turn in your sleep and sigh.

492
00:50:30,977 --> 00:50:32,477
And your toenails.

493
00:50:32,477 --> 00:50:34,527
Even if I say I don't love him,

494
00:50:35,397 --> 00:50:38,397
if I say that
I love someone else...

495
00:50:39,937 --> 00:50:43,977
Me, who has no one
on this earth...

496
00:50:44,727 --> 00:50:47,437
Do you still want me
to marry him?

497
00:50:51,027 --> 00:50:52,977
You will love him.

498
00:51:08,067 --> 00:51:09,397
Miss!

499
00:51:16,397 --> 00:51:17,397
<i>In the end,</i>

500
00:51:17,397 --> 00:51:21,897
<i>Hideko accepted the proposal,
provided that I come to Japan too.</i>

501
00:51:21,897 --> 00:51:24,647
<i>The Count, after feigning
annoyance for a bit,</i>

502
00:51:24,647 --> 00:51:26,437
<i>nodded his head.</i>

503
00:51:27,937 --> 00:51:30,107
<i>On the day her Uncle left
to visit his mine,</i>

504
00:51:30,107 --> 00:51:34,567
<i>the Count pretended to go back
to Japan, and hid nearby.</i>

505
00:51:47,647 --> 00:51:50,607
You'll have a week of freedom,

506
00:51:51,107 --> 00:51:55,777
but always remember
the basement.

507
00:52:41,647 --> 00:52:43,277
Miss!

508
00:53:27,937 --> 00:53:34,437
<i>Thank you for travelling
on our ferry today.</i>

509
00:53:34,777 --> 00:53:40,277
<i>We will arrive at Shimonoseki
at 7:30 pm...</i>

510
00:53:47,437 --> 00:53:48,937
Finally we're going home.

511
00:53:49,277 --> 00:53:50,777
It's been three years...

512
00:54:42,777 --> 00:54:44,857
To not steal...

513
00:54:45,357 --> 00:54:46,857
To not steal...

514
00:54:47,527 --> 00:54:48,857
To not commit adultery...

515
00:54:49,187 --> 00:54:51,357
To not commit adultery...

516
00:54:52,027 --> 00:54:53,777
To not lie...

517
00:54:54,107 --> 00:54:56,277
To not lie...

518
00:55:45,777 --> 00:55:50,817
<i>Spider thread pulled

519

520
00:55:56,107 --> 00:55:59,067
<i>Thousand woes</i>

<i>Under the blue sky

522
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:21,897
<i>How sorrowful my zither
My beloved zither</i>

523
00:56:28,567 --> 00:56:30,567
Did you sleep well?

524
00:56:40,727 --> 00:56:41,777
Excuse me.

525
00:56:42,397 --> 00:56:43,437
Sorry.

526
00:56:48,727 --> 00:56:53,897
<i>The Count paid the innkeeper to spy
on us, afraid we might run off.</i>

527
00:56:54,227 --> 00:56:57,227
Why get dressed?
I've nothing to do anyway.

528
00:56:59,727 --> 00:57:01,437
<i>Things are moving too slowly.</i>

529
00:57:01,437 --> 00:57:04,647
<i>I fear Hideko might
truly go mad.</i>

530
00:57:05,727 --> 00:57:07,897
Shall we play 'maid',
like before?

531
00:57:11,397 --> 00:57:15,607
<i>From morning to night
we see no sign of the Count.</i>

532
00:57:15,607 --> 00:57:19,567
<i>Certifying the marriage and

533
00:57:19,567 --> 00:57:21,567
<i>require much work, he says.</i>

534
00:57:51,527 --> 00:57:53,437
How cruel can you be?

535
00:57:53,437 --> 00:57:56,817
You plucked the flower,
now re-plant it.

536
00:57:56,817 --> 00:57:58,937
What do you want?

537
00:57:58,937 --> 00:58:02,777
Hurry up and throw her
into the madhouse!

538
00:58:09,937 --> 00:58:11,937
<i>A week here...</i>

539
00:58:13,937 --> 00:58:15,437
<i>Then finally...</i>

540
00:59:00,027 --> 00:59:01,527
This way.

541
00:59:12,857 --> 00:59:14,527
Who is that person?

542
00:59:16,857 --> 00:59:18,857
The Countess Lady Fujiwara.

543
00:59:18,857 --> 00:59:21,857
Her maiden name was
Izumi Hideko.

544
00:59:23,187 --> 00:59:24,687
And who might you be?

545
00:59:25,187 --> 00:59:26,687
I am the Lady's handmaiden.

546
00:59:27,687 --> 00:59:31,027
Then, what kind of treatment

547
00:59:31,027 --> 00:59:33,687
do you believe
your Lady requires?

548
00:59:48,357 --> 00:59:51,687
She should be confined in a place

549
00:59:51,687 --> 00:59:57,607
where no one can harm her,
and where she can do no harm.

550
00:59:59,687 --> 01:00:04,607
Just a few tests, then let's have
lamb chops at the Peace Hotel.

551
01:00:19,027 --> 01:00:21,027
Almost there.
Good work.

552
01:00:23,107 --> 01:00:25,027
Don't be frightened.

553
01:01:00,107 --> 01:01:02,277
Good day, Countess.

554
01:01:02,897 --> 01:01:04,897
Do you remember me?

555
01:01:08,227 --> 01:01:09,437
Countess?

556
01:01:18,687 --> 01:01:19,727
What is this?

557
01:01:20,147 --> 01:01:23,397
We mean you no harm, Countess.

558
01:01:23,397 --> 01:01:25,477
We're going to look after you.

559
01:01:26,687 --> 01:01:30,647
You've got the wrong person.
She is the Countess.

560
01:01:31,147 --> 01:01:33,437
Tell them, Your Lordship!

561
01:01:34,727 --> 01:01:38,777
She still believes
she's a Korean handmaiden.

562
01:01:40,107 --> 01:01:43,687
It's because
her nanny was Korean.

563
01:01:44,317 --> 01:01:46,527
You scoundrel!

564
01:01:47,687 --> 01:01:49,897
Let go of me,
you filthy bitches!

565
01:01:49,897 --> 01:01:53,437
We do not use such language here,
your Ladyship.

566
01:01:53,437 --> 01:01:54,317
Miss!

567
01:01:59,227 --> 01:02:03,277
My poor Lady,
she's gone nutty.

568
01:02:04,477 --> 01:02:06,897
If it's any help,

569
01:02:06,897 --> 01:02:11,727
this is from her mammy,
and she used to cherish it

570
01:02:13,227 --> 01:02:15,397
before going mad.

571
01:02:19,477 --> 01:02:22,147
Such a considerate maid.

572
01:02:24,227 --> 01:02:27,227
<i>You thought
Hideko a lamb.</i>

573
01:02:28,227 --> 01:02:30,067
<i>Lamb, my arse.</i>

574
01:02:31,567 --> 01:02:35,227
<i>I tell you, right from
the start Miss Izumi Hideko...</i>

575
01:02:37,897 --> 01:02:40,227
<i>had always been...</i>

576
01:02:40,607 --> 01:02:41,647
Miss!

577
01:02:42,227 --> 01:02:44,227
<i>...a rotten bitch.</i>

578
01:02:50,227 --> 01:02:53,107
PART TWO

579
01:02:53,107 --> 01:02:55,727
I'm not a rotten bitch!
No! No!

580
01:03:03,107 --> 01:03:05,277
Put it in your mouth, Hideko.

581
01:03:08,397 --> 01:03:10,227
Hold out your hand.

582
01:03:32,897 --> 01:03:35,727
Next time you feel
like talking back,

583
01:03:36,227 --> 01:03:39,727
remember the taste
of this metal bead.

584
01:03:45,817 --> 01:03:48,897
You'll sleep alone from tonight.

585
01:03:58,937 --> 01:03:59,777
All right?

586
01:03:59,777 --> 01:04:01,277
Please give me a light.

587
01:04:01,777 --> 01:04:04,937
We've been ordered to save oil.

588
01:04:05,607 --> 01:04:07,277
You little brat.

589
01:04:07,277 --> 01:04:08,937
Speak Japanese!

590
01:04:11,437 --> 01:04:14,937
In there is a man
the size of an ogre

591
01:04:15,607 --> 01:04:19,777
who can't stand the sound
of girls screaming.

592
01:04:20,107 --> 01:04:23,777
If he hears you, he'll burst in
through that door after you.

593
01:04:24,937 --> 01:04:26,777
And then?

594
01:04:29,777 --> 01:04:34,107
He'll smother you
with his giant body.

595
01:04:34,777 --> 01:04:36,777
So you can't make a sound.

596
01:04:51,277 --> 01:04:52,477
Aunt.

597
01:04:52,977 --> 01:04:54,777
My, my.

598
01:04:56,277 --> 01:04:59,357
Scaring a little girl like that.

599
01:05:49,027 --> 01:05:50,607
And me?

600
01:05:51,777 --> 01:05:53,397
Am I pretty too?

601
01:05:57,477 --> 01:05:59,187
Look closely.

602
01:06:04,027 --> 01:06:07,567
Everyone says

01:08:12,437 --> 01:08:16,107
It runs in your mother's family.

636

That's why I'm training you.

To set your mind right.

638
01:08:20,897 --> 01:08:25,897
If I fail, there's a place called
a "mental hospital" in Japan.

Established by
the rational Germans,

640
01:08:32,437 --> 01:08:35,817
it's very effective
in treating lunacy.

641
01:08:36,727 --> 01:08:40,437
They dig holes in the dirt,
put a patient in each one,

642
01:08:40,437 --> 01:08:42,107
and put lids on top.

643
01:08:42,107 --> 01:08:46,437
If patients improve
they get a leash,

644
01:08:46,437 --> 01:08:49,227
so they can crawl
around like dogs.

and-smooth-as-jade..."

650
01:09:36,107 --> 01:09:38,437
You must pause between words.

651
01:09:39,107 --> 01:09:42,107
Don't read like a dog
lapping at his plate!

652
01:09:44,437 --> 01:09:47,437
Listen to your aunt read.

653
01:09:54,437 --> 01:09:58,937
"When Jinlian finally
took off her clothes,

654
01:09:59,277 --> 01:10:03,107
Ximen Qing examined
her Jade Gate,

655
01:10:03,107 --> 01:10:05,107
'Discovering the Secret Well'

656
01:10:05,107 --> 01:10:08,437
to find it hairless,
white as snow,

657
01:10:09,107 --> 01:10:11,777
and smooth as jade.

658
01:10:11,777 --> 01:10:14,437
Tight as a drum,

659
01:10:14,437 --> 01:10:16,607
and soft as silk.

660
01:10:17,607 --> 01:10:22,437
Once he drew apart
the curtains of flesh,

661
01:10:23,777 --> 01:10:29,437
a scent of well-aged wine
emanated from within,

662
01:10:30,607 --> 01:10:35,607
and on fold upon fold
of the red velvet interior

663
01:10:35,937 --> 01:10:38,277
beads of dew were forming.

664
01:10:38,937 --> 01:10:44,277
Its centre was dark and void,

665
01:10:45,107 --> 01:10:48,437
yet as if it had its own life,

666
01:10:48,777 --> 01:10:53,277
it twitched and twitched."

667
01:11:21,187 --> 01:11:25,357
<i>Everyone wanted to cut it down,
but my uncle refused.</i>

668
01:11:26,187 --> 01:11:31,027
<i>He said this tree from Mt. Fuji
had absorbed my aunt's soul.</i>

669
01:11:32,027 --> 01:11:37,687
<i>The servants whispered it was
due to the tree's high cost,</i>

670
01:11:37,687 --> 01:11:40,687
<i>but I think my uncle was right.</i>

671
01:11:41,187 --> 01:11:44,187
<i>You can tell
from the cherry blossoms,</i>

672
01:11:44,187 --> 01:11:47,687
<i>which turned brighter
and bloomed longer.</i>

673
01:12:20,527 --> 01:12:23,067
"Tell me, Juliette.

674
01:12:23,067 --> 01:12:30,527
Do you wish this impetuous
young knight to save you?

675
01:12:35,647 --> 01:12:39,567
The duchess shook
her head resolutely,

676
01:12:39,567 --> 01:12:42,777
to my great disappointment.

677
01:12:45,227 --> 01:12:46,277
Now...

678
01:12:47,227 --> 01:12:49,277
...my brave knight."

679
01:12:54,317 --> 01:12:56,777
<i>Oh, it's a new face!</i>

680
01:12:59,897 --> 01:13:00,897
"Now...

681
01:13:01,277 --> 01:13:03,567
...my brave knight.

682
01:13:04,567 --> 01:13:10,897
When you see these old scars
and the fresh pink wounds,

683
01:13:11,317 --> 01:13:13,397
what do you feel?

684
01:13:16,777 --> 01:13:19,227
I pity the poor woman.

685
01:13:19,227 --> 01:13:24,567
I wish to lick her and lick her,
caress her and caress her.

686
01:13:25,317 --> 01:13:27,607
If you pity her so,

687
01:13:28,477 --> 01:13:32,897
why not take her place
and let her whip you?

688
01:13:39,777 --> 01:13:44,107
The duchess raised the whip
high in the air, and then...

689
01:13:51,897 --> 01:13:53,607
And again...

690
01:14:01,477 --> 01:14:04,477
My cock became painfully erect.

691
01:14:10,107 --> 01:14:14,107
If she could be yours
for ten minutes,

692
01:14:14,107 --> 01:14:16,567
what would you give
in exchange?

693
01:14:16,937 --> 01:14:20,227
Whatever your heart desires.

694
01:14:20,567 --> 01:14:23,567
Anything in this whole wide world.

695
01:14:24,937 --> 01:14:28,567
Once the duke untied me,

696
01:14:28,567 --> 01:14:32,567
I sat on the chair,
pulled her to me,

697
01:14:32,977 --> 01:14:37,567
and slid my cock
into her cunt.

698
01:14:42,567 --> 01:14:45,567
Oh, Juliette, Juliette...

699
01:14:48,107 --> 01:14:52,977
As I felt the duke approach
from behind,

700
01:14:52,977 --> 01:14:55,647
a rope slithered
around my neck.

701
01:14:57,107 --> 01:15:00,437
The duke slowly
tightened the rope.

702
01:15:00,437 --> 01:15:05,107
Like a drowning man
grasping at straws,

703
01:15:05,107 --> 01:15:09,607
I pulled the swirling
currents of her hair.

704
01:15:10,777 --> 01:15:13,277
Then the duke spoke.

705
01:15:15,607 --> 01:15:18,607
The ten minutes are almost up.

706
01:15:28,607 --> 01:15:32,437
Slowly, my dear,
said the Duchess...

707
01:15:33,107 --> 01:15:37,607
I haven't yet
fully savoured his pain.

708
01:15:43,937 --> 01:15:47,607
No, the knight cried,
don't stop!

709
01:15:49,437 --> 01:15:52,607
Please let me die

710
01:15:52,607 --> 01:15:54,777
in the midst of this pain.

711
01:15:55,437 --> 01:15:58,027
In this suffocating pain."

712
01:16:32,527 --> 01:16:34,027
Is it Sade?

713
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:36,937
It's Sade-esque.

714
01:16:36,937 --> 01:16:41,937
Believed to be the same Japanese
man who wrote 'The Lizard Skin'.

715
01:16:42,687 --> 01:16:47,607
Acquired from a Japanese sailor
on a ship from Hamburg.

716
01:16:50,607 --> 01:16:54,687
Can you imagine my joy when,

717
01:16:54,687 --> 01:16:59,607
after such a journey, it sat
on my shelf with its brothers?

718
01:16:59,607 --> 01:17:04,567
These are the babes
to whom I feel the most affection.

719
01:17:05,607 --> 01:17:11,607
It used to contain an elaborate
monochrome woodcut illustration,

720
01:17:13,977 --> 01:17:15,567
but as you can see...

721
01:17:15,567 --> 01:17:17,817
<i>So unfortunate.</i>

722
01:17:17,817 --> 01:17:22,607
If that were intact,
you could've named your price.

723
01:17:22,607 --> 01:17:27,027
The author felt words alone could
not fully describe the positions,

724
01:17:27,027 --> 01:17:30,607
and so included an illustration.

725
01:17:31,937 --> 01:17:35,607
In that regard,
before we start the bidding.

726
01:17:36,067 --> 01:17:37,067
Hideko!

727
01:17:40,607 --> 01:17:43,727
<i>'Pain is a Garment'</i>

728
01:18:57,777 --> 01:18:59,067
<i>Beautiful!</i>

729
01:19:05,607 --> 01:19:07,607
See you again.

730
01:19:08,397 --> 01:19:09,397
Yes, thank you.

731
01:19:10,567 --> 01:19:13,817
Today's reading was outstanding.

732
01:19:14,147 --> 01:19:15,567
Yes, thank you.

733
01:19:17,397 --> 01:19:19,147
<i>Especially the puppet!</i>

734
01:19:26,227 --> 01:19:28,227
You are of noble birth,

735
01:19:28,227 --> 01:19:33,067
yet you engage in the lowly work
of copying paintings.

736
01:19:33,067 --> 01:19:36,227
There was a time when

737
01:19:36,227 --> 01:19:39,897
I dissipated my wit and skills
on gambling.

738
01:19:39,897 --> 01:19:43,647
Imagine the torment
of having so many women

739
01:19:43,647 --> 01:19:45,647
make advances on me,

740
01:19:45,647 --> 01:19:48,897
when I couldn't afford to
buy them a glass of Burgundy.

741
01:19:49,897 --> 01:19:54,397
Do the women here
advance on you?

742
01:19:54,817 --> 01:19:56,937
I look at women's eyes.

743
01:19:56,937 --> 01:19:58,727
Only the eyes.

744
01:19:58,727 --> 01:20:02,607
They turn their gaze away,

745
01:20:03,397 --> 01:20:05,977
but then they always look back.

746
01:20:06,817 --> 01:20:11,817
If I were to slide under
someone's covers tonight,

747
01:20:11,817 --> 01:20:15,727
only one woman here
would refuse me.

748
01:20:16,727 --> 01:20:19,227
Does that include Mrs. Sasaki?

749
01:20:20,147 --> 01:20:22,977
Is she not your former wife?

750
01:20:22,977 --> 01:20:25,977
You left her to marry
a Japanese woman.

751
01:20:26,437 --> 01:20:30,727
But the servants tell me
you still share a bed with her.

752
01:20:30,727 --> 01:20:33,067
You went so far as to
abandon your wife,

753
01:20:33,067 --> 01:20:35,727
why this urge
to become Japanese?

754
01:20:37,977 --> 01:20:39,727
Because Korea is ugly

755
01:20:40,147 --> 01:20:43,067
and Japan is beautiful.

756
01:20:44,317 --> 01:20:47,527
Some Japanese say
Japan is ugly,

757
01:20:47,527 --> 01:20:49,567
and Korea is beautiful.

758
01:20:49,567 --> 01:20:52,027
Beauty is cruel by nature.

759
01:20:52,027 --> 01:20:56,027
Korea is soft, slow, dull,
and therefore hopeless.

760
01:20:57,777 --> 01:21:01,607
Does it include Mrs. Sasaki?

761
01:21:02,607 --> 01:21:04,277
If I gave her the right signal,

762
01:21:04,277 --> 01:21:08,777
she'd knock on my door
without her underwear.

763
01:21:12,777 --> 01:21:14,777
My thoughts exactly.

764
01:21:16,937 --> 01:21:18,937
Then who is it?

765
01:21:18,937 --> 01:21:21,777
The one who would deny you?

766
01:21:23,607 --> 01:21:26,777
I heard you own
the highest quality

767
01:21:26,777 --> 01:21:30,437
antique bookmaking tools
of East and West,

768
01:21:31,277 --> 01:21:32,937
but I don't see them here?

769
01:21:32,937 --> 01:21:36,777
Who would deny you?

770
01:21:39,277 --> 01:21:44,437
I met Hideko's eyes by chance,
but she didn't look away.

771
01:21:44,437 --> 01:21:47,777
Indeed it was I
who shifted my gaze.

772
01:21:47,777 --> 01:21:54,777
Will she make an appearance
in your lewd dreams tonight?

773
01:21:56,527 --> 01:21:59,857
Even if honoured
with such a visit,

774
01:21:59,857 --> 01:22:01,777
I don't think I could consummate.

775
01:22:02,357 --> 01:22:05,687
Because her body
would be as cold as waterfowl.

776
01:22:10,687 --> 01:22:13,687
The result of long training.

777
01:22:17,437 --> 01:22:20,437
I heard you are engaged to her.

778
01:22:20,857 --> 01:22:28,357
If I'm not mistaken,
you are yet to have intercourse?

779
01:22:29,357 --> 01:22:32,107
Her eyes have no desire.

780
01:22:32,527 --> 01:22:35,687
It means her soul
is dead inside.

781
01:22:36,937 --> 01:22:39,357
You should go easy
on her training,

782
01:22:39,357 --> 01:22:42,687
unless you enjoy
making love to a corpse.

783
01:23:34,437 --> 01:23:38,227
My particular way
of possessing beauty.

784
01:23:39,687 --> 01:23:43,227
Hideko too must have
received painting lessons?

785
01:23:43,227 --> 01:23:47,227
I was too occupied teaching
her to read with correct diction.

786
01:23:47,817 --> 01:23:48,897
Dear me!

787
01:23:49,227 --> 01:23:51,477
In England, where I studied,

788
01:23:51,477 --> 01:23:57,437
all ladies were expected to produce
vibrant colour and graceful lines,

789
01:23:58,777 --> 01:24:01,567
even in the less noble families.

790
01:24:15,647 --> 01:24:17,647
A phone call, sir.

791
01:24:18,477 --> 01:24:20,567
At this hour?

792
01:24:20,567 --> 01:24:22,567
It's the Iwamura Bookstore.

793
01:24:23,147 --> 01:24:24,147
Is that so?

794
01:24:24,567 --> 01:24:26,567
Excuse me a moment.

795
01:24:36,567 --> 01:24:38,437
You are mesmerising.

796
01:24:39,897 --> 01:24:41,647
Men use the word "mesmerising"

797
01:24:41,647 --> 01:24:45,897
when they wish to touch
a lady's breasts.

798
01:24:46,777 --> 01:24:50,897
I'm familiar with
Western conversational etiquette.

799
01:24:52,477 --> 01:24:55,647
I do a bit of reading,
you know.

800
01:24:56,107 --> 01:24:58,567
There was no calculation
in what I said.

801
01:24:58,567 --> 01:25:03,607
It was a reflex, like pulling
one's hand from a flame.

802
01:25:04,437 --> 01:25:05,727
I'm no flame.

803
01:25:06,277 --> 01:25:09,647
I'm cold as waterfowl,
your Lordship.

804
01:25:15,647 --> 01:25:17,647
He will return soon.

805
01:25:17,647 --> 01:25:20,567
Mr. Iwamura only called
with a frivolous inquiry,

806
01:25:20,567 --> 01:25:22,647
at my request.

807
01:25:22,647 --> 01:25:25,977
There's an issue regarding
your future you should know.

808
01:25:26,397 --> 01:25:29,647
I'll wait by the stone lamp
at midnight.

809
01:25:31,397 --> 01:25:34,817
That Iwamura is a real fool.

810
01:26:23,437 --> 01:26:25,607
My maid is asleep
in the room next door.

811
01:26:25,607 --> 01:26:28,277
I don't fancy being in
scandalous rumours with you.

812
01:26:28,277 --> 01:26:31,607
I saw Junko go to the
servants' quarters with her pillow.

813
01:26:31,607 --> 01:26:33,937
Consider your reputation
as a nobleman.

814
01:26:34,437 --> 01:26:36,437
I'm no nobleman.

815
01:26:36,437 --> 01:26:38,107
I'm not even Japanese.

816
01:26:38,107 --> 01:26:41,937
Think it was easy for a Korean
farmhand's son to reach here?

817
01:26:41,937 --> 01:26:45,937
Fifteen hard years in Japan
before hearing about you.

818
01:26:45,937 --> 01:26:47,937
Another three years to prepare.

819
01:26:48,477 --> 01:26:52,147
I studied bookmaking
and learned to paint forgeries.

820
01:26:52,147 --> 01:26:54,437
All so that I could meet you.

821
01:26:54,437 --> 01:26:56,027
To seduce and marry you,

822
01:26:56,027 --> 01:26:58,357
to possess your
father's inheritance,

823
01:26:59,187 --> 01:27:01,187
and then probably
to get rid of you.

824
01:27:02,937 --> 01:27:04,937
But I knew as soon as I met you.

825
01:27:04,937 --> 01:27:07,277
For a man to seduce you
would be...

826
01:27:09,357 --> 01:27:10,857
...impossible.

827
01:27:12,437 --> 01:27:15,687
So in place of seduction,
I decided to propose a deal.

828
01:27:17,107 --> 01:27:20,527
Most marriages are prison,
but this one will free you.

829
01:27:21,357 --> 01:27:23,357
I'll rescue you from here,

830
01:27:23,357 --> 01:27:26,857
take you far away,
and give you freedom.

831
01:27:28,357 --> 01:27:30,527
Of course,
we'll split the money.

832
01:27:31,527 --> 01:27:33,357
Nonsense.

833
01:27:34,027 --> 01:27:38,607
Marrying an old man with a black
tongue at your tender age makes sense?

834
01:27:38,607 --> 01:27:40,857
I won't marry anyone.

835
01:27:40,857 --> 01:27:42,357
What have you in mind?

836
01:27:48,107 --> 01:27:49,937
That's not proper.

837
01:27:49,937 --> 01:27:51,227
There's no beauty in that.

838
01:27:51,857 --> 01:27:54,067
If you kill yourself,
what of your fortune?

839
01:27:54,727 --> 01:27:59,567
That will be the sum of your efforts?
Your fortune going to a pervert?

840
01:27:59,567 --> 01:28:03,647
So he can buy 10 little girls
and teach them to read books?

841
01:28:05,027 --> 01:28:07,317
My uncle will find us somehow.

842
01:28:07,687 --> 01:28:09,607
Then he'll take us
to the basement.

843
01:28:10,147 --> 01:28:11,227
Uncle.

844
01:28:12,357 --> 01:28:13,357
The basement?

845
01:28:13,357 --> 01:28:16,647
It says here
when people are hanged,

846
01:28:16,647 --> 01:28:21,437
their tongues stick out
and faeces is expelled.

847
01:28:22,647 --> 01:28:26,437
But that day,
Aunt's mouth was shut

848
01:28:27,437 --> 01:28:29,477
and her bottom was clean.

849
01:28:30,937 --> 01:28:32,937
Want to go somewhere nice?

850
01:28:50,777 --> 01:28:54,817
I'll tell you in detail
what I did to your aunt

851
01:28:54,817 --> 01:28:57,067
after I caught her
running away.

852
01:28:57,067 --> 01:29:01,727
So don't you ever think
of running, understood?

853
01:29:19,607 --> 01:29:21,817
That day I just
watched and listened.

854
01:29:21,817 --> 01:29:25,477
But if I ever
end up there again...

855
01:29:30,317 --> 01:29:32,067
Highly concentrated opium.

856
01:29:32,067 --> 01:29:34,397
Three drops will make you
sleep all day.

857
01:29:34,397 --> 01:29:37,317
Five drops will
knock down a horse.

858
01:29:37,317 --> 01:29:40,227
If you crave death
within five minutes,

859
01:29:40,227 --> 01:29:42,067
drink it all.

860
01:29:42,067 --> 01:29:45,477
If you carry this, he can never
take you to the basement.

861
01:29:45,477 --> 01:29:46,977
At least not alive.

862
01:29:47,777 --> 01:29:49,647
It'll be my wedding gift to you.

863
01:29:50,147 --> 01:29:51,977
It's more expensive than jewels.

864
01:30:03,397 --> 01:30:08,727
Bring a girl to be my maid. One who
could disappear and not be missed.

865
01:30:08,727 --> 01:30:10,477
If a bit dense, all the better.

866
01:30:10,477 --> 01:30:14,817
We'll send her to a madhouse
under my name.

867
01:30:15,437 --> 01:30:17,817
I can find you a new maid,

868
01:30:17,817 --> 01:30:19,777
but what do we do
about Junko?

869
01:30:25,477 --> 01:30:30,437
You really think I'm prettier
than Miss Hideko?

870
01:30:31,727 --> 01:30:35,897
Sure, Hideko's pretty,
and you're pretty.

871
01:30:35,897 --> 01:30:37,897
What?
You speak Korean?

872
01:30:39,477 --> 01:30:40,817
You know...

873
01:30:41,727 --> 01:30:43,147
I learned it.

874
01:30:43,567 --> 01:30:46,567
To speak more easily with you.

875
01:30:47,567 --> 01:30:50,437
I really wanted to
say this to you.

876
01:30:51,607 --> 01:30:53,147
You are just mesmerising.

877
01:30:53,147 --> 01:30:54,437
Oh my gosh!

878
01:30:56,397 --> 01:30:58,397
You little tart!

879
01:31:03,437 --> 01:31:04,567
I can't!

880
01:31:05,477 --> 01:31:08,437
If they catch me with a guest,
I'll be thrown out!

881
01:31:09,607 --> 01:31:13,647
Forget this wretched place.
Come live with me!

882
01:32:00,777 --> 01:32:02,107
Oh, fucking hell!

883
01:32:03,107 --> 01:32:04,277
Fucking hell?

884
01:32:04,277 --> 01:32:05,437
Fucking hell...

885
01:32:35,437 --> 01:32:38,107
<i>The Count sent
exactly what I ordered.</i>

886
01:32:38,107 --> 01:32:40,607
<i>Naive and a bit foolish.</i>

887
01:32:44,107 --> 01:32:45,607
Mother!

888
01:32:56,607 --> 01:33:01,777
<i>Show Sookee your clothes and
jewellery at every opportunity.</i>

889
01:33:01,777 --> 01:33:06,187
<i>The material greed she got from her
mother will make her more gullible.</i>

890
01:33:06,187 --> 01:33:12,027
<i>P.S. Don't worry if she reads this
letter, she's totally illiterate.</i>

891
01:33:12,357 --> 01:33:13,777
Would you read it to me?

892
01:33:14,357 --> 01:33:15,187
Pardon?

893
01:33:15,187 --> 01:33:16,357
<i>'Countess Fujiwara Hideko'</i>

894
01:33:16,357 --> 01:33:19,527
This is your name.
Can't you read it?

895
01:33:24,607 --> 01:33:26,357
What's with your foot?

896
01:33:30,357 --> 01:33:31,527
Who did it?

897
01:33:32,027 --> 01:33:34,527
Who took Tamako's shoe?

898
01:33:41,357 --> 01:33:43,687
Apologise before all the servants!

899
01:33:46,857 --> 01:33:49,937
If she ever runs away
because of one of you,

900
01:33:49,937 --> 01:33:52,227
I'll strip you all naked
and throw you out!

901
01:33:53,567 --> 01:33:54,857
Fucking hell.

902
01:33:59,277 --> 01:34:00,567
All smooth.

903
01:34:07,527 --> 01:34:09,067
You like the scent?

904
01:34:09,897 --> 01:34:11,527
Want to come in?

905
01:34:11,527 --> 01:34:12,527
Pardon?

906
01:34:29,647 --> 01:34:31,567
No need to be
ashamed at all.

907
01:34:31,567 --> 01:34:33,857
Your average fence
can barely tell them apart.

908
01:34:33,857 --> 01:34:35,897
Is that so?

909
01:34:41,437 --> 01:34:43,567
<i>Returning the earrings
you loaned me.</i>

910
01:34:44,067 --> 01:34:47,107
<i>A woman might wager her fate
on such an exquisite pair.</i>

911
01:34:48,147 --> 01:34:50,897
<i>I'm sure that Sookee
will try her very best</i>

912
01:34:50,897 --> 01:34:55,527
<i>in order to see herself
wearing these in the mirror.</i>

913
01:34:56,067 --> 01:34:59,317
<i>I'll tell you how to keep her
from getting suspicious.</i>

914
01:34:59,647 --> 01:35:02,727
<i>Keep her busy until
the day of the wedding.</i>

915
01:35:03,277 --> 01:35:05,477
<i>Make her spend all her energy</i>

916
01:35:05,477 --> 01:35:08,067
<i>on making you
fall in love with me.</i>

917
01:35:09,727 --> 01:35:13,567
<i>In other words, don't fall
in love with me so easily.</i>

918
01:35:15,227 --> 01:35:16,067
Me?

919
01:35:25,227 --> 01:35:27,647
Dressed up,
you look like a lady too.

920
01:35:35,567 --> 01:35:37,817
How did your mum die?

921
01:35:38,477 --> 01:35:41,897
That she was so lucky
to have you before dying.

922
01:35:42,817 --> 01:35:44,897
That she had no regrets.

923
01:35:46,067 --> 01:35:50,277
<i>Is this the companionship
they write about in books?</i>

924
01:35:58,107 --> 01:35:59,647
Men are disgusting.

925
01:36:00,227 --> 01:36:02,937
How can they be so
single-minded?

926
01:36:03,567 --> 01:36:05,107
What's on my mind?

927
01:36:06,147 --> 01:36:09,607
You don't really believe
that I crave your body?

928
01:36:11,437 --> 01:36:12,147
You do!

929
01:36:12,567 --> 01:36:14,397
You read too many
of those books.

930
01:36:14,397 --> 01:36:16,227
If there's one thing
I'm after, Miss...

931
01:36:17,397 --> 01:36:22,317
It's not your eyes,
your hands or ass,

932
01:36:22,817 --> 01:36:25,147
it's your money, only that.

933
01:36:25,897 --> 01:36:28,567
Of all that you have,
money is the best.

934
01:36:30,397 --> 01:36:33,647
Feels great being so rude
to a noble lady.

935
01:36:34,227 --> 01:36:35,897
<i>What's with her?</i>

936
01:36:36,727 --> 01:36:40,897
<i>Why does she stomp her feet,
expressing her anger,</i>

937
01:36:40,897 --> 01:36:43,647
<i>sit up in the middle
of the night and sigh?</i>

938
01:36:45,067 --> 01:36:49,437
<i>Every time she sees the Count,
her eyes seem to say...</i>

939
01:36:49,977 --> 01:36:51,647
I despise you.

940
01:36:52,527 --> 01:36:58,107
Try to bear it. Only if she sees this
will she believe the proposal.

941
01:37:16,937 --> 01:37:20,777
Think of me as that puppet,
and I'll imagine another woman.

942
01:37:21,277 --> 01:37:22,937
What woman?

943
01:37:25,937 --> 01:37:27,937
The duchess Juliette.

944
01:37:30,437 --> 01:37:31,607
Lady!

945
01:37:32,777 --> 01:37:34,777
Milord!

946
01:37:39,937 --> 01:37:41,107
Lady...

947
01:37:45,107 --> 01:37:48,937
"The lady's emotions
lay deep inside...

948
01:37:49,277 --> 01:37:52,107
Jinlian could not fathom
their depths.

949
01:37:53,937 --> 01:37:56,027
Knowing this, Lady Sun

950
01:37:56,027 --> 01:38:00,187
gave Jinlian four
small silver balls.

951
01:38:00,187 --> 01:38:04,777
These are 'minling',
or 'bells of passion.'

952
01:38:04,777 --> 01:38:08,527
Place two in
the lady's Jade Gate,

953
01:38:08,527 --> 01:38:11,687
and the other two in yours.

954
01:38:14,187 --> 01:38:16,357
Spread your legs apart

955
01:38:16,357 --> 01:38:19,027
and like two scissors

956
01:38:19,027 --> 01:38:21,357
trying to cut each other,
put them together.

957
01:38:21,357 --> 01:38:24,437
When the lips below
rub against each another,

958
01:38:24,437 --> 01:38:26,437
you'll hear
a clear ringing sound.

959
01:38:26,437 --> 01:38:28,187
<i>A blackout!
Bring a lantern!</i>

960
01:38:28,687 --> 01:38:30,277
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

961
01:38:30,277 --> 01:38:32,187
<i>'The Sound of Bells
on a Windless Night'</i>

962
01:38:34,187 --> 01:38:38,187
When do I put this in?
asked Jinlian.

963
01:38:39,187 --> 01:38:43,607
Does the lady breathe deeply
and swallow hard?

964
01:38:45,107 --> 01:38:48,107
Does she whisper sweetly
in your ear,

965
01:38:48,107 --> 01:38:49,777
and kiss you?

966
01:38:55,067 --> 01:38:57,187
Does she embrace you tightly

967
01:38:57,187 --> 01:38:59,567
and caress your nipples?

968
01:39:01,567 --> 01:39:03,857
Does her secret part
become slippery

969
01:39:03,857 --> 01:39:06,567
as she gently bites
your shoulder?

970
01:39:07,187 --> 01:39:10,687
Then, put in the bells."

971
01:39:15,107 --> 01:39:19,437
- Amazing!
- Indeed!

972
01:39:36,857 --> 01:39:38,937
It's so cute.

973
01:39:44,437 --> 01:39:46,317
If the Count sees this...

974
01:39:53,437 --> 01:39:56,277
Will he really be
so tender as this?

975
01:39:57,437 --> 01:39:58,567
Of course.

976
01:39:58,567 --> 01:40:01,817
And he'll touch you like this...

977
01:40:02,777 --> 01:40:04,277
And like this...

978
01:40:12,437 --> 01:40:14,227
Tamako, keep doing it.

979
01:40:15,437 --> 01:40:17,147
Like the Count would.

980
01:40:19,857 --> 01:40:21,067
The Count...

981
01:40:21,477 --> 01:40:22,567
The Count...

982
01:40:23,477 --> 01:40:25,647
He'll go crazy over this.

983
01:40:28,397 --> 01:40:31,857
And this is what he'll say.

984
01:40:33,647 --> 01:40:39,567
It's so soft, warm,
wet, and...

985
01:40:43,607 --> 01:40:47,897
s...s...spellbindingly beautiful!

986
01:41:19,647 --> 01:41:22,817
Shall I teach you more, Miss?

987
01:41:22,817 --> 01:41:24,727
Yes...

988
01:41:25,727 --> 01:41:27,727
Teach me everything.

989
01:42:11,897 --> 01:42:16,897
I wish that I had breast milk
so I could feed you.

990
01:42:31,477 --> 01:42:33,567
Do you like it when I do this?

991
01:42:34,777 --> 01:42:36,227
Do you like me?

992
01:42:38,147 --> 01:42:40,777
Can you promise
that you won't betray me?

993
01:42:42,477 --> 01:42:43,777
I'll never...

994
01:42:44,227 --> 01:42:45,277
never...

995
01:42:46,727 --> 01:42:48,727
ever...

996
01:43:02,277 --> 01:43:08,437
Miss, how could such an innocent...

997
01:43:08,437 --> 01:43:10,777
You must be a natural.

998
01:44:06,437 --> 01:44:07,687
Stop!

999
01:44:09,357 --> 01:44:12,437
I spit it out without chewing!
All because of you!

1000
01:44:13,277 --> 01:44:14,687
She's got no one
on this earth.

1001
01:44:14,687 --> 01:44:18,187
If you frighten her,
she'll close up hard as a clam.

1002
01:44:25,187 --> 01:44:26,187
You see?

1003
01:44:27,607 --> 01:44:30,357
If you don't give the impression
you want this marriage,

1004
01:44:30,357 --> 01:44:33,687
she may throw another fit
and refuse to go forward.

1005
01:44:33,687 --> 01:44:37,027
Be more convincing
when you pretend to love me.

1006
01:44:37,027 --> 01:44:38,357
I can't do it.

1007
01:44:38,357 --> 01:44:39,187
What?

1008
01:44:40,187 --> 01:44:41,527
I want to quit.

1009
01:44:42,777 --> 01:44:45,107
What's with you all today?

1010
01:44:47,277 --> 01:44:49,107
You feel sorry for her?

1011
01:44:52,277 --> 01:44:54,437
What is it with women?

1012
01:44:57,277 --> 01:45:01,527
You know what that poor
Sookee said about your Ladyship?

1013
01:45:01,527 --> 01:45:05,147
That you're too dense to get it
if someone pulls on your nipples.

1014
01:45:05,147 --> 01:45:08,147
That she was nice out of pity,
but you ate it up.

1015
01:45:08,147 --> 01:45:10,027
That you were so gullible!

1016
01:45:10,027 --> 01:45:13,647
That naive servant's face...

1017
01:45:13,647 --> 01:45:16,227
Yes... you will love him.

1018
01:45:16,227 --> 01:45:19,477
If I say that
I love someone else...

1019
01:45:20,527 --> 01:45:24,897
Me, who has no one
on this earth...

1020
01:45:25,527 --> 01:45:27,937
Do you still want me
to marry him?

1021
01:45:28,477 --> 01:45:29,277
Yes.

1022
01:45:41,067 --> 01:45:42,227
Miss!

1023
01:46:04,937 --> 01:46:07,817
I wish I'd never been born.

1024
01:46:20,567 --> 01:46:23,977
I wish I'd never been born.

1025
01:46:43,727 --> 01:46:44,727
Let go.

1026
01:46:47,397 --> 01:46:50,437
Miss, I'm sorry!

1027
01:46:52,977 --> 01:46:53,937
Let go!

1028
01:46:54,437 --> 01:46:56,647
I'm sorry, Miss!

1029
01:46:56,647 --> 01:46:58,397
Don't die.

1030
01:46:58,727 --> 01:47:00,397
I'm sorry.

1031
01:47:02,397 --> 01:47:04,227
What are you sorry about?

1032
01:47:05,397 --> 01:47:10,397
I tried to trick you into
marrying that bastard.

1033
01:47:10,397 --> 01:47:14,397
I was going to put you
in a madhouse and run off.

1034
01:47:15,107 --> 01:47:19,107
Don't die.
Don't get married, Miss!

1035
01:47:21,227 --> 01:47:24,897
Sookee,
are you worried about me?

1036
01:47:30,227 --> 01:47:31,937
I'm worried about you.

1037
01:47:37,397 --> 01:47:40,567
How do you know my name?

1038
01:47:41,437 --> 01:47:43,857
You think you're tricking me?

1039
01:47:46,227 --> 01:47:47,937
You're the one being tricked.

1040
01:47:49,317 --> 01:47:51,977
You're the one
bound for the madhouse.

1041
01:47:53,817 --> 01:47:56,777
I was going to lock you up
in there under my name,

1042
01:47:56,777 --> 01:48:00,277
then I'd become you
and run far away, with him.

1043
01:48:04,937 --> 01:48:09,107
I won't say sorry,
since you tried to trick me too.

1044
01:48:15,937 --> 01:48:19,437
That fucking son of a bitch!

1045
01:48:20,607 --> 01:48:23,607
Oh, sorry Miss!

1046
01:48:23,607 --> 01:48:27,937
<i>"I hope this letter finds you well.
This is Sookee.</i>

1047
01:48:27,937 --> 01:48:32,277
<i>I'm writing to inform you
of a change in plans.</i>

1048
01:48:32,277 --> 01:48:37,277
<i>I decided to team up
with the Lady Hideko.</i>

1049
01:48:37,277 --> 01:48:40,437
<i>As such, I'm now in need
of all your help.</i>

1050
01:48:40,437 --> 01:48:42,777
<i>I'm enclosing an item
as advance payment."</i>

1051
01:48:42,777 --> 01:48:47,317
Always remember
the basement.

1052
01:49:01,777 --> 01:49:04,027
Want to go somewhere nice?

1053
01:49:35,857 --> 01:49:38,357
You didn't teach me
to read Japanese.

1054
01:50:00,687 --> 01:50:03,027
Did that bastard draw this?

1055
01:50:05,187 --> 01:50:10,107
Is this what you've been reading
to that dirty old man

1056
01:50:10,687 --> 01:50:12,527
and those gentlemen?

1057
01:52:18,567 --> 01:52:20,817
<i>The daughter of
a legendary thief,</i>

1058
01:52:20,817 --> 01:52:23,777
<i>who sewed winter coats
out of stolen purses.</i>

1059
01:52:24,147 --> 01:52:27,437
<i>Herself a thief,
pickpocket, swindler.</i>

1060
01:52:28,477 --> 01:52:31,147
<i>The saviour who came to
tear my life apart.</i>

1061
01:52:31,567 --> 01:52:33,277
<i>My Tamako.</i>

1062
01:52:33,897 --> 01:52:35,567
<i>My Sookee.</i>

1063
01:53:26,607 --> 01:53:28,567
You scoundrel!

1064
01:53:28,567 --> 01:53:30,937
Let go of me,
you filthy bitches!

1065
01:53:32,437 --> 01:53:33,477
Miss!

1066
01:53:34,437 --> 01:53:35,727
Let go!

1067
01:53:37,727 --> 01:53:39,317
Miss!

1068
01:53:54,187 --> 01:53:55,437
I'm hungry.

1069
01:53:59,937 --> 01:54:04,437
The first month, I ordered
a slim herringbone suit.

1070
01:54:05,477 --> 01:54:06,527
PART THREE

1071
01:54:06,527 --> 01:54:08,607
The next month, I wore it to
dine at the Imperial Hotel.

1072
01:54:09,107 --> 01:54:12,277
Me, a colonial boy working
as a tout at a brothel.

1073
01:54:12,277 --> 01:54:15,437
Some Englishmen who frequented
the brothel recognised me.

1074
01:54:15,437 --> 01:54:19,107
I thought they'd call the
matre d' and kick me out,

1075
01:54:19,607 --> 01:54:20,937
but what do you know?

1076
01:54:21,607 --> 01:54:26,277
They were amused
I'd spend a month's pay

1077
01:54:26,277 --> 01:54:27,777
on one dignified meal.

1078
01:54:28,607 --> 01:54:31,107
They started calling me 'Count'

1079
01:54:31,107 --> 01:54:32,937
and taught me manners
to go with the name.

1080
01:54:32,937 --> 01:54:35,437
Frankly, I'm not that
interested in money itself.

1081
01:54:35,437 --> 01:54:38,107
What I desire is,
how shall I put it...

1082
01:54:39,107 --> 01:54:41,777
The manner of ordering wine
without looking at the price?

1083
01:54:41,777 --> 01:54:43,147
Something like that.

1084
01:54:55,027 --> 01:54:57,607
Fourteen hours by train
from Vladivostok

1085
01:54:57,607 --> 01:55:00,027
is the summer home of a
genuine Russian noble family.

1086
01:55:01,937 --> 01:55:03,527
Shall we marry there?

1087
01:55:08,027 --> 01:55:10,357
In a few days I'll hear
from the hospital.

1088
01:55:12,357 --> 01:55:15,357
That my wife Fujiwara Hideko
has died.

1089
01:55:17,027 --> 01:55:21,687
You didn't just ask them
to keep her?

1090
01:55:22,527 --> 01:55:26,107
I doubt Sookee would want
to live there very long.

1091
01:55:34,527 --> 01:55:36,357
Fuck!

1092
01:55:41,277 --> 01:55:43,437
I arranged it with
a photography studio.

1093
01:55:43,437 --> 01:55:45,607
We'll replace this with
your photograph.

1094
01:55:46,527 --> 01:55:50,357
From tomorrow,
we'll give Sookee a new life.

1095
01:55:50,897 --> 01:55:52,357
I'm glad.

1096
01:55:52,357 --> 01:55:54,277
Marry me once again.

1097
01:55:55,147 --> 01:55:56,687
This time as Nam Sookee.

1098
01:55:58,437 --> 01:56:00,817
You want another wedding night?

1099
01:56:06,937 --> 01:56:10,107
I think I like you... slightly.

1100
01:56:13,437 --> 01:56:16,027
Poor Sookee,
in a place like that

1101
01:56:17,067 --> 01:56:19,107
all by herself...

1102
01:56:21,107 --> 01:56:24,107
Did such a thought
ever cross your mind?

1103
01:56:24,567 --> 01:56:27,107
Not at all.
Why should I pity her?

1104
01:56:27,107 --> 01:56:30,477
Where I come from,
it's illegal to be naive.

1105
01:56:30,477 --> 01:56:34,147
Where you come from, it's not naive
to fall in love with a business partner?

1106
01:56:34,147 --> 01:56:36,147
Of course. It's illegal.

1107
01:56:36,607 --> 01:56:40,107
So even if my love for you
leads me to ruin,

1108
01:56:40,567 --> 01:56:42,227
don't pity me.

1109
01:56:42,817 --> 01:56:44,067
Love?

1110
01:56:46,147 --> 01:56:48,147
What does a crook
know about love?

1111
01:57:12,147 --> 01:57:13,397
Fire!

1112
01:57:21,977 --> 01:57:25,977
C...c...come this way!

1113
01:57:25,977 --> 01:57:27,067
This way!

1114
01:58:36,727 --> 01:58:39,727
Because you desired me,

1115
01:58:39,727 --> 01:58:41,727
and overcame
all obstacles to reach me,

1116
01:58:41,727 --> 01:58:44,227
I have been born anew,
it's true.

1117
01:58:45,567 --> 01:58:47,357
I'm grateful for that.

1118
01:58:49,607 --> 01:58:51,647
I'll allow a kiss.

1119
01:58:56,647 --> 01:58:57,437
No.

1120
01:58:57,777 --> 01:58:58,777
Why not?

1121
01:59:01,937 --> 01:59:04,277
I don't like
kisses with conditions.

1122
01:59:04,277 --> 01:59:06,937
I never learned
how to stop halfway.

1123
01:59:08,937 --> 01:59:14,107
After this I'll thrust in deep,
to your navel.

1124
01:59:15,437 --> 01:59:17,107
Please do that.

1125
01:59:20,607 --> 01:59:22,777
Those aren't the eyes
of one who wants it.

1126
01:59:22,777 --> 01:59:25,777
You know you can't
deceive me in such matters.

1127
01:59:30,607 --> 01:59:34,777
If I could be yours
for ten minutes,

1128
01:59:34,777 --> 01:59:36,777
what would you give
in exchange?

1129
01:59:37,437 --> 01:59:39,777
Whatever your heart desires.

1130
01:59:39,777 --> 01:59:42,777
Anything in this whole wide world.

1131
02:00:06,937 --> 02:00:09,277
There's much
I want to teach you.

1132
02:00:10,437 --> 02:00:13,607
You'll become a
completely new woman.

1133
02:02:04,897 --> 02:02:07,647
It won't hurt.
You know from those books?

1134
02:02:07,647 --> 02:02:11,607
In truth, women feel
the greatest pleasure

1135
02:02:11,607 --> 02:02:13,567
when taken by force.

1136
02:02:13,937 --> 02:02:16,937
Now I'm going to
rip your underwear.

1137
02:03:53,437 --> 02:03:55,897
Would you fetch those for me?

1138
02:04:40,107 --> 02:04:42,107
Respected Uncle,

1139
02:04:43,277 --> 02:04:48,187
<i>it always pained me
to see you straining</i>

1140
02:04:48,187 --> 02:04:53,147
<i>to speak flawless Japanese
before the Count from Nagoya,</i>

1141
02:04:53,147 --> 02:04:56,187
<i>and even to quiver your voice
like a nobleman.</i>

1142
02:04:58,437 --> 02:05:04,937
<i>So I'm happy to inform you
that you no longer need do so.</i>

1143
02:05:05,777 --> 02:05:10,107
<i>That man is the son
of a Korean farmhand.</i>

1144
02:05:11,107 --> 02:05:16,107
<i>Oh, did my gift arrive safely?</i>

1145
02:05:16,607 --> 02:05:19,937
<i>Please tell this to my gift,
in Korean.</i>

1146
02:05:21,107 --> 02:05:22,937
<i>I'm afraid that in real life,</i>

1147
02:05:23,937 --> 02:05:27,607
<i>no woman feels pleasure
at being taken by force.</i>

1148
02:05:27,607 --> 02:05:33,277
<i>But, for sending me Sookee
out of all the girls in the world,</i>

1149
02:05:33,277 --> 02:05:35,607
<i>I feel "slightly" grateful.</i>

1150
02:05:48,937 --> 02:05:52,647
You wished to see
my bookmaking tools?

1151
02:05:52,647 --> 02:05:56,607
Don't just look,
experience them for yourself.

1152
02:05:57,187 --> 02:05:59,607
I'll choose five books
that I cherish...

1153
02:05:59,607 --> 02:06:02,527
...that I used to cherish
more than anything.

1154
02:06:04,687 --> 02:06:05,687
Let's see...

1155
02:06:05,687 --> 02:06:06,607
First,

1156
02:06:09,857 --> 02:06:11,607
'Confessions of a Whip'

1157
02:06:20,857 --> 02:06:22,687
'The Lizard Skin'

1158
02:06:34,437 --> 02:06:37,437
'Decadent Girls
Who Sell Lingerie'

1159
02:06:47,607 --> 02:06:50,437
May I please
smoke a cigarette, sir?

1160
02:06:51,357 --> 02:06:52,277
Sir.

1161
02:06:55,107 --> 02:06:57,277
<i>'Bells and Balls'</i>

1162
02:07:00,727 --> 02:07:02,607
'The Mortician's Bedroom'

1163
02:07:14,897 --> 02:07:17,777
How could you let
a little girl fool you?

1164
02:07:20,937 --> 02:07:25,067
<i>But don't worry.
I'll catch them for you soon.</i>

1165
02:07:27,567 --> 02:07:32,977
I arranged so that no two girls
travelling together can leave Kobe.

1166
02:07:39,277 --> 02:07:41,727
Please change the destination
to Shanghai.

1167
02:07:41,727 --> 02:07:44,897
Changing two tickets,
from Vladivostok to Shanghai.

1168
02:07:44,897 --> 02:07:46,727
Yes, that's correct.

1169
02:07:47,397 --> 02:07:49,027
Show me your passports.

1170
02:07:56,107 --> 02:07:57,977
Miss Nam Sookee?

1171
02:08:00,897 --> 02:08:02,777
Mr. Go Pan-dol?

1172
02:08:10,977 --> 02:08:13,477
You need to pay
an additional 3 yen.

1173
02:08:13,897 --> 02:08:14,897
All right.

1174
02:08:18,727 --> 02:08:23,227
I'm just an old man
who likes dirty stories.

1175
02:08:25,067 --> 02:08:29,317
Even listening to the same story,
people imagine different things.

1176
02:08:29,317 --> 02:08:32,727
Peering into each of
those fantasies

1177
02:08:32,727 --> 02:08:35,777
was this old man's
humble recreation.

1178
02:08:36,277 --> 02:08:39,317
What to do,
now that it's all over?

1179
02:08:39,977 --> 02:08:42,397
You should at least
tell me your story.

1180
02:08:44,227 --> 02:08:47,727
How did that bitch Hideko taste?

1181
02:08:48,437 --> 02:08:51,647
Was she fully ripe?
Tell me.

1182
02:08:54,397 --> 02:08:57,147
A cigarette might
help my memory.

1183
02:08:57,727 --> 02:08:59,727
Right, right...

1184
02:09:00,937 --> 02:09:04,727
You have that silly
penchant for cigarettes?

1185
02:09:21,727 --> 02:09:25,647
So how was Hideko?

1186
02:09:31,727 --> 02:09:35,727
You have no windows here?

1187
02:09:39,277 --> 02:09:42,607
Sookee could be listening in.
Let's do our best.

1188
02:09:54,317 --> 02:09:56,067
<i>That's it, good.</i>

1189
02:10:07,647 --> 02:10:09,317
<i>What's this?</i>

1190
02:10:09,317 --> 02:10:11,817
You can't stop there, dear fellow.

1191
02:10:11,817 --> 02:10:14,727
So, where did you touch first?

1192
02:10:14,727 --> 02:10:16,067
<i>Her face?</i>

1193
02:10:18,477 --> 02:10:19,817
Her breasts?

1194
02:10:21,277 --> 02:10:23,817
c...cunt?

1195
02:10:25,817 --> 02:10:27,277
Was it soft?

1196
02:10:28,107 --> 02:10:29,897
Did it tighten up?

1197
02:10:31,227 --> 02:10:33,397
Did it have many wrinkles?

1198
02:10:34,437 --> 02:10:36,397
Was it sufficiently wet?

1199
02:10:36,397 --> 02:10:39,727
The viscosity and transparency
of her vaginal secretion?

1200
02:10:41,397 --> 02:10:44,027
Please, one more cigarette, sir.

1201
02:11:10,437 --> 02:11:15,777
<i>Spider thread pulled
into strings...</i>

1202
02:11:17,777 --> 02:11:23,107
<i>I dare say no book
has ever described</i>

1203
02:11:23,107 --> 02:11:25,277
<i>such a ferocious wedding night.</i>

1204
02:11:27,937 --> 02:11:32,277
<i>I thought I heard
a nightingale sing.</i>

1205
02:12:06,357 --> 02:12:11,027
<i>And... the clear,
bright crimson blood!</i>

1206
02:12:20,527 --> 02:12:22,857
<i>Thus the Lady
became my wife.</i>

1207
02:12:23,357 --> 02:12:27,027
<i>Coy one moment,
bold the next...</i>

1208
02:12:30,937 --> 02:12:35,687
But how was she coy,

1209
02:12:35,687 --> 02:12:39,857
how was she bold,
tell it to me in detail!

1210
02:12:40,527 --> 02:12:43,277
A story is all about the journey.

1211
02:12:43,777 --> 02:12:46,187
You should know.

1212
02:12:47,687 --> 02:12:49,397
Did she resist?

1213
02:12:50,527 --> 02:12:53,107
So did you pinch her ass
as punishment?

1214
02:12:53,437 --> 02:12:57,227
Or did she spit at you
in contempt?

1215
02:12:57,727 --> 02:12:59,397
Or else...

1216
02:13:00,107 --> 02:13:02,437
Did she beg you to do it?

1217
02:13:03,317 --> 02:13:06,687
'The Widow's Lapdog?'

1218
02:13:10,317 --> 02:13:11,687
How dare you!

1219
02:13:11,687 --> 02:13:13,647
Hideko is my wife.

1220
02:13:14,067 --> 02:13:18,647
What kind of scoundrel rattles on
about his wedding night!

1221
02:14:25,477 --> 02:14:26,567
It's odd...

1222
02:14:28,477 --> 02:14:30,067
Your smoke.

1223
02:14:32,777 --> 02:14:35,897
It's cold, blue...

1224
02:14:37,477 --> 02:14:43,437
and strangely beautiful.

1225
02:14:44,727 --> 02:14:51,607
You too have become
soft, slow and dull.

1226
02:14:53,277 --> 02:14:56,317
Mercury is most deadly
in its gaseous state.

1227
02:14:57,067 --> 02:14:59,477
One cigarette
would have sufficed.

1228
02:15:03,227 --> 02:15:07,567
At least I will die
with my cock intact.

1229
02:19:07,647 --> 02:19:11,897
<i>I hear a sound
in the distance</i>

1230
02:19:11,897 --> 02:19:16,227
<i>that sounds like
the steps of my love</i>

1231
02:19:16,227 --> 02:19:20,437
<i>An echo that
makes my heart</i>

1232
02:19:20,437 --> 02:19:23,777
<i>skip a beat</i>

1233
02:19:24,607 --> 02:19:29,147
<i>But I wait
all through the night</i>

1234
02:19:29,147 --> 02:19:32,727
<i>and my love never
comes to me</i>

1235
02:19:33,397 --> 02:19:37,647
<i>There is no end
to the heartache</i>

1236
02:19:37,647 --> 02:19:41,397
<i>that grips me
in this hour</i>

1237
02:19:41,897 --> 02:19:45,647
<i>Waiting for
the footsteps of</i>

1238
02:19:46,147 --> 02:19:49,397
<i>my dear love</i>

1239

<i>Waiting for

1240
02:19:54,727 --> 02:19:58,477
<i>my dear love</i>

1241
02:20:16,227 --> 02:20:20,397
<i>But then in
my waiting heart</i>

1242
02:20:20,397 --> 02:20:24,777
<i>suddenly
happiness overflows</i>

1243
02:20:24,777 --> 02:20:29,067
<i>There you are
in the distance</i>

1244
02:20:29,067 --> 02:20:32,817
<i>coming to me</i>

1245
02:20:33,317 --> 02:20:37,567
<i>Filled with dreams
of a new life</i>

1246
02:20:37,567 --> 02:20:41,397
<i>filled with happiness</i>

1247
02:20:41,897 --> 02:20:45,727
<i>Inside my waiting heart</i>

1248
02:20:46,227 --> 02:20:49,897
<i>flowers start to bloom</i>

1249
02:20:50,437 --> 02:20:54,277
<i>Come my lover,
come to me</i>

1250
02:20:54,647 --> 02:20:58,147
<i>I missed you so</i>

1251
02:20:58,977 --> 02:21:02,567
<i>Let's dream of
happy times</i>

1252
02:21:03,227 --> 02:21:07,397
<i>like long ago</i>

1253
02:21:24,607 --> 02:21:28,897
<i>Filled with dreams
of a new life</i>

1254
02:21:28,897 --> 02:21:32,727
<i>filled with happiness</i>

1255
02:21:33,277 --> 02:21:37,067
<i>Inside my waiting heart</i>

1256
02:21:37,437 --> 02:21:41,277
