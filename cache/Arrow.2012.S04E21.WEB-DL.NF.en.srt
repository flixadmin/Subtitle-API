Russia, Markovia, Corto Maltese,
us, every NATO ally.

00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:45,002
Rubicon has control
over all their nuclear systems.

6
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:46,588
You mean HIVE does.

7
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:48,923
I know it's a little late for this,
but whoever created an algorithm

8
00:00:49,006 --> 00:00:53,220
that could override any country's
nuclear weapons really screwed up.

9
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:54,637
That would be Amanda Waller.

10
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:57,557
How much time do we have?

11
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:58,975
"We"?

12
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,895
Oliver, I'm the director of ARGUS
and this goes way over my head.

13
00:01:03,896 --> 00:01:06,233
This is executive-level
and this is Department of Defense.

14
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,485
Right. Right, right, right.
But how much time?

15
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:11,028
There's a startup sequence
before Darhk can actually launch a nuke.

16
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:12,655
We have just under 21 hours.

17
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,991
Yeah, you're gonna have to find
a way to interrupt that sequence.

18
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,034
Rubicon is a fail-safe
against nuclear Armageddon.

19
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,371
ARGUS designed it to be 100% un-hackable.

20
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,623
No, she can do it. She's the best.

21
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:24,251
Uh, actually, that would be my father.
As far as Rubicon's concerned.

22
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,919
It uses Fourier protocols.
Noah practically wrote the book on them.

23

(SIGHS)

24
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:29,506
The world is facing nuclear Armageddon.

25
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,841
My pride and my general dislike
for my father can take a backseat

26
00:01:31,924 --> 00:01:33,426
for the next 20-plus hours.

27
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,803
Felicity, this isn't about pride.
Your father's a criminal.

28
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:36,888
He can't be trusted.

29
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:39,932
I'm not saying we should trust him,
I'm saying we need to.

30
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:43,145
Okay. He got out in Darhk's jailbreak.

31
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:44,646
-How do we find him?
-I'm already running a search.

32
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:46,022
Can you try
and get in touch with Thea, too?

33
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:47,106
Please, we need her back here.

34
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,317
John, can I talk to you for a second?

36
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,989
-How you doing?
-Been better.

37
00:01:55,072 --> 00:01:57,534
Well, I'm not going to pretend
to understand what you're going through...

38
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,161
Well, Oliver, you've been through this
with your mother,

39
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:00,203
which is why I can't quite understand

40
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:01,288
why you're putting the fate of the world

41
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,539
in the hands of another evil parent.

42
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:05,041
I'm not trusting Kuttler.
I trust Felicity,

43
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,794
and we should just let
her do her job. Okay?

44
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,546
We have one of our own.

45
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:10,630
Yeah. Stopping Darhk.

46
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:14,592
His magic is powered by death.
So, if even one of those nukes hits...

47
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:17,137
He will be unstoppable.
Okay, what's your plan?

48
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,597
Well, if he is planning
on harnessing all of this death,

49
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:22,392
he's gonna be at
something called a nexus chamber.

50
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,227
Basically, it's a collector of magic.

51
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,813
And here I thought earthquake machines
were as strange as it got.

52
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:30,650
Esrin Fortuna told me that
one of these chambers exists in Star City.

53
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:32,944
I'm betting it falls on a ley line.

54
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:34,237
What'd Vixen call them?

55
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:35,822
-"Wi-Fi for magic"?
-Yeah.

56
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,740
It's a big city, Oliver,
we've got 21 hours.

57
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,867

Well, Reiter and his men
found a way on the island.

64
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,505
There has to be a way off.

65
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:56,426
{\an8}There's a plane.
East end of the island. It's far.

66
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,844
We'll make it.

67
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,889
-What's that?
-This may be a way to call for help.

68
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:02,974
Let's go.

I know.

72
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:22,327
The predictability
was a terrible flaw in the design.

73
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,204
Predictability is your flaw, too.

you show up.

77
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:37,384
Is that hand a present
from your new best friend?

78
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,137
I'm not doing this for a prosthetic, Thea.

79
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:45,308
-I'm doing it to keep you safe.
-Keep me safe.

80
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:46,476
-Yes. Keep you safe.
-Yeah.

81
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,561
Like I said, predictable.

82
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,314
Only thing I don't get is,

83
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:54,359
how is brainwashing
some guy I really like

84
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,486
in your plan to keep me safe?

85
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:57,695
His conditioning wasn't my idea.

86
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,990
Ruvé Darhk wanted to assure
his compliance in the final phase.

87
00:04:01,073 --> 00:04:02,534
Final phase of what?

88
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:04,744
Something called Genesis.

89
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:09,249
Darhk plans to burn the world
in a nuclear fire

90
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,083
while we are protected down here.

91
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,129
Then he and his followers can rebuild.

92
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,758
Truth be told,
it's not dissimilar to the plan

93
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,927
I had for the Glades, once upon a time.

94
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,012
But on a much, much larger scale.

95
00:04:23,095 --> 00:04:24,431
Let me guess.

96
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:27,892
You don't think that destroying
the entire world is completely insane.

97
00:04:27,975 --> 00:04:32,063
The world is what's insane.
It is beyond saving.

98
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:35,608
It needs a do-over. A reset.

99
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:39,404
Look, once I realized
Darhk's plan was inevitable,

100
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:40,572
the math was simple...

101
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,031
Save yourself.

102
00:04:42,114 --> 00:04:43,283
And my daughter.

103
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,619
Even if she doesn't want to be saved.

104
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:51,458
Look, I am way, way past the point
of telling you

105
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,501
that you are crazy.

106
00:04:55,002 --> 00:04:56,671
I just want to see Alex,

107
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,341
just want to know he's okay.

108
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:04,512
And, look, I get it, I'm stuck here.

109
00:05:05,262 --> 00:05:07,682
But I can be stuck here and compliant

110
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,977
or I can be a pain in your ass.

111
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,355
So take me to him.

112
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,106
Now.

124
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,271
(STAMMERS) But this isn't
any of your business, Donna.

125
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:57,482
No, no, babe. It is my business, actually.

00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:00,693
-It is, kind of.
-But, Donna...

128
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,362
Hey. What is this?

129
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:07,074
It's... It's, um...

130
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,452
It's an affidavit.

131
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:13,372
Pike said if I put my name to it,
then I can get my badge back.

132
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:16,250
It says you didn't know
that Laurel was the Black Canary.

00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:18,545
(SCOFFS)

134
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,298
I may not be in Mansa,
but I know how to read, sweetie.

135
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,967
I think it's "Mensa," actually.

136
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:28,846
You told me
that you knew what Laurel was doing.

137
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,641
-Yeah.
-Yeah, so?

138
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:33,392
This is a lie.

139
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,021
Yeah, but it's a complicated lie.

140
00:06:37,104 --> 00:06:38,481
-Is it?
-Yeah.

141
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:40,567
Yeah.

142
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,487
'Cause, according to Pike,
IAB are willing to look the other way

00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,322
about my working with Darhk,

144
00:06:49,241 --> 00:06:50,452
'cause I was protecting Laurel.

145
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:53,079
Why would you have to protect her
if she was a superhero?

146
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,747
Yeah, exactly. Now you see?

00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:59,836
I see that they're asking you to lie.

All I ever wanted was to be a cop.

Now, what's a small lie if it means
I can do some good for this city?

No.

00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:51,638
Gentlemen.
I've a little errand I need you to run.

162
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:54,641
A loose end
that needs tying up, not unlike...

163
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:56,726
(GRUNTS)

164
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,479
Oh, do I detect some obstinacy, Mr. Brick?

165
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:02,857
I'm just used to giving the orders, Darhk.
Not taking them.

166
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,234
Not even as a little thank-you
for busting you out of Iron Heights?

167
00:08:05,317 --> 00:08:06,778
Whatever happened to gratitude?

168
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,237
I'm here, ain't I?

169
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,659
And when the whole world is sitting
under a field of mushroom clouds,

170
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,326
you'll be glad that you are.

171
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,122
Now then, back to the errand.

172
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:22,418
Have either you boys
heard of The Calculator?

173
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:31,928
There's no one here.

174
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,471
Found a deep-trunk fiber-optic hook-up
with polymorphic encryption.

175
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:35,848
Noah is there, trust me.

176
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,892
She's right. Look.

177
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,520
Whoever rigged that up
didn't want to be surprised.

178
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,022
I'm tracing the Bluetooth signal.
Head southwest.

179
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:46,901
Nope. He's not here.

180
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,653
-He has to be.
<i>-He was.</i>

181
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,572
Looks like he bolted, and in a hurry.

This was 20 minutes ago.

186
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,386
Looks like Kuttler wasn't the only one
that left Iron Heights.

187
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:20,059
Those are Ghosts with him.
What does HIVE want with my father?

188
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:21,644
<i>Okay.</i>

189
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,938

but less swell at resisting torture.

199
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:57,179
So why don't you spare me the trouble

200
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:00,307
and tell me where I can find Damien Darhk?

{\an8}Kuttler's the only one
who can stop Rubicon.

204
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:17,283
{\an8}That's why Darhk wanted him dead.
You all right?

205
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,702
{\an8}Yeah. The word "conflicted" comes to mind.

206
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,203
{\an8}Well, at least we know he got away.

{\an8}With not much of a head start.

208
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,207
{\an8}I hacked Kuttler's server
to see if there was anything in there

209
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,583
{\an8}that could point us
to where he would run to,

You know, your father
could go all night...

Okay, that's enough. I don't...

286
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:09,181
You know what? Actually, I think
you were conceived in Ravenspur.

Because you said that
you shot Andy in self-defense.

Oliver, I don't want to talk about this.

You've just never said anything
about self-defense to me, John.

Couldn't tell Lyla the truth

305
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:02,401
and have her look at me
the same way anymore.

00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:03,819
Come on, you don't know that.

307

to lecture someone about lying
to the people they love.

I'm not lecturing.

310
