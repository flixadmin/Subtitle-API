Well, you're lucky
to have me.

140
00:08:34,377 --> 00:08:36,377
To be fair,
I'm quite a catch.

141

behave yourself tomorrow?

143
00:08:40,882 --> 00:08:44,118
No. No, I'm gonna do my job.
That's what I'm gonna do.

144
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,187
I can't, you know,
not do my job.

145
00:08:46,189 --> 00:08:48,055
The guy you work for
is a complete...

146
00:08:48,057 --> 00:08:50,124
I don't work for Drake.
I work for my firm,

147
00:08:50,126 --> 00:08:51,759
and my firm works for him.

148
00:08:51,761 --> 00:08:54,228
And I'm sure
that they defend many people

149
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:57,332
that you don't deem worthy,
but we don't want a repeat.

150
00:08:57,334 --> 00:09:00,100
- A repeat?
- Of the <font color="#00FF7F"><i>Daily Globe</i></font> incident.

151
00:09:00,102 --> 00:09:01,836
Ow! Really?

152
00:09:01,838 --> 00:09:03,638
- Incident? That's not an incident.
- Mmm-hmm.

153
00:09:03,674 --> 00:09:04,939
- Baby, you were run out of New York.
- I was not. I did not.

154
00:09:04,941 --> 00:09:06,341
I don't want you
run out of San Francisco.

155
00:09:06,343 --> 00:09:08,877
No, I still have
currency in New York.

156
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:11,179

157

I was going places.

159
00:09:14,051 --> 00:09:15,883
In fact, I moved
to San Francisco for you.

160
00:09:15,885 --> 00:09:18,752
- Me?
- You are my home.

161

You're not so bad yourself,

162

- Less talking, more kissing.
- All right.

that literally doubles
the life expectancy

it tripled their

And then...
<font color="#87CEFA">(whooshes)</font> Rockets.

215
00:12:23,645 --> 00:12:25,647
You then decide,
like any normal human being,

216
00:12:25,881 --> 00:12:27,649
that you're gonna go
and explore space.

217
00:12:27,883 --> 00:12:30,182
You know what it is?
I have always believed...

218
00:12:30,184 --> 00:12:32,017
- Uh-huh.
- ...that space exploration

219
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:33,620
is crucial
in our quest to cure

220
00:12:33,622 --> 00:12:35,555
everything that ails us
here on Earth.

221
00:12:35,557 --> 00:12:37,122
But if you think about
everything we've found...

222
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:38,557
- Uh-huh.
- ...in the oceans and on land,

223
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:40,493
- isn't it time to look up there?
- Mmm-hmm.

224
00:12:40,495 --> 00:12:42,996
To this plethora
of untapped resources?

225
00:12:42,998 --> 00:12:44,496
And you have a plethora
of untapped resources, also,

226
00:12:44,498 --> 00:12:46,332
from your pharmaceutical
companies

227
00:12:46,334 --> 00:12:48,133
that you're involved with,
you know, to help you realize

228
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:49,334
- that ambition, I suppose.
- Of course.

229
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:50,671
- Yeah.
- Full circle.

230
00:12:50,673 --> 00:12:52,972
So, I have to ask,
how does that work,

231
00:12:52,974 --> 00:12:54,574

How does it, um...

233
00:12:56,578 --> 00:12:58,511
I don't know,
how does it go about,

- Sorry.

Long journal entry
about that tonight.

1394
01:15:04,364 --> 01:15:06,130
You're being dumb, Brock.
I'm not insane.

1395
01:15:06,132 --> 01:15:09,300
What's insane is the way
humans choose to live today.

1396
01:15:09,302 --> 01:15:11,869
Think about it.
All we do is take, take, take.

1397
01:15:11,871 --> 01:15:13,304
It can't go on.

1398
01:15:13,306 --> 01:15:15,841
We've brought the planet
to the brink of extinction.

1399
01:15:15,843 --> 01:15:17,842
We're parasites.
You're a good example.

1400
01:15:17,844 --> 01:15:19,513
Think about it.
All you do is take.

1401
01:15:19,747 --> 01:15:23,447
You took my Symbiote. You
take potshots at a great man

1402
01:15:23,449 --> 01:15:25,250
- trying to get something done.
- Who?

1404

Didn't you take from the
person you loved the most,

1405
01:15:29,455 --> 01:15:31,957
who trusted you the most?
That's insane.

1406
01:15:31,959 --> 01:15:36,461
What I've initiated is a whole
new world, a new species.

1407
01:15:36,463 --> 01:15:38,897
Man and Symbiote combined.

1408
01:15:38,899 --> 01:15:41,466
Let me tell you something, buddy.
All right? Just man-to-man.

1409
01:15:41,468 --> 01:15:44,536
Because I have spent a significant
amount of time, all right,

1410
01:15:44,538 --> 01:15:47,939
with one of these creatures
up my ass.

1411
01:15:47,941 --> 01:15:49,241
It's not a lot of fun.

1412
01:15:49,243 --> 01:15:51,844
And then I find out,
all along,

1413
01:15:51,846 --> 01:15:53,246
that they're killing you.

1414
01:15:53,248 --> 01:15:54,980
This is the last time
I'm asking you.

1415
01:15:54,982 --> 01:15:57,517
- Where is my Symbiote?
- I have no idea.

1416
01:15:57,519 --> 01:16:00,053
- Where is he?
- Oh, my God!

1417
01:16:00,055 --> 01:16:01,556
Where's Venom?

1418
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:05,357
That is the ugliest-looking
thing I have ever seen.

your mess.

I tried to keep them alive.

1426
01:16:35,825 --> 01:16:39,225
There are more of us.
Millions more.

1427
01:16:39,227 --> 01:16:41,429
They will follow
wherever I lead.

1428

Where we lead.

1429

Yes, "we."

1430

But first,
we must retrieve them.

1431

I can take care of that.

1432

you gonna walk me to death?

harm, hurt, possibly,
very possibly,
