1
00:00:01,202 --> 00:00:02,835
<i>There's a war coming.</i>

2
00:00:02,837 --> 00:00:04,403
<i>A terrible war.</i>

3
00:00:04,405 --> 00:00:05,471
<i>There will be chaos,</i>

4
00:00:05,473 --> 00:00:07,172
<i>Rivers of blood in the streets.</i>

5
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:08,073
I know it!

6
00:00:08,075 --> 00:00:09,575
I-i-i can see it coming.

7
00:00:09,577 --> 00:00:11,176
<i>It's time.
Somebody has to take over.</i>

8
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:13,445
<i>It might as well be me.</i>

9
00:00:15,383 --> 00:00:17,249
<i>My name's james gordon.
I'm a detective.</i>

10
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:18,617
I will find the man
who did this.

11
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:19,651
Pepper was framed

12
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:21,620
<i>By fish mooney and the cops.</i>

13
00:00:21,622 --> 00:00:23,555
James gordon is not a good guy.
You deserve better.

14
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:25,357
<i>Don't ever come back to gotham.</i>

15
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,826
<i>I spoke with cobblepot
before he died.</i>

16
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:29,795
<i>Men who are about to die</i>

17
00:00:29,797 --> 00:00:30,829
Are very honest.

18
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:32,931
<i>I am gonna kill that old man.</i>

19
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:36,735
<i>I just wish
penguin was still alive.</i>

20
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:38,470
<i>I've been watching you.</i>

21
00:00:38,472 --> 00:00:41,407
I saw who really
killed the waynes.

22
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:57,189
Excuse me! Uh!

23
00:00:57,191 --> 00:00:58,857
Hey! Yo!

24
00:00:58,859 --> 00:00:59,958
Lay it on me.

25
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:10,102
Thank you.

26
00:01:10,104 --> 00:01:11,503
Stop him!

27
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,074
Ooh! You need some...?

28
00:01:15,076 --> 00:01:16,842
Home.

29
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:20,846
And let's go live
for some breaking news...

30
00:01:20,848 --> 00:01:22,247
Thank you, jason.

31
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:23,949
I'm coming to you
with the latest wrinkle

32
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:25,484
In a story that sent shockwaves

33
00:01:25,486 --> 00:01:26,585
Through the financial world
of gotham.

34
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:29,088
I'm standing before
the home of ronald danzer,

35
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:30,756
The man who bilked
investors out of

36
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:32,257
A reported
half billion dollars

37
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:33,625
In a vast ponzi scheme.

38
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:36,028
Danzer is currently out on bail
awaiting trial.

39
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,031
All of them... the judge,
the jury, the d. A....

40
00:01:39,033 --> 00:01:41,433
Pay them whatever it takes.

41
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,335
I am not going to prison
just because

42
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:44,703
A few dumb bus drivers

43
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:48,373
And stupid old ladies
lost their damn pensions.

44
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,309
I got to sneak out.

45
00:01:50,311 --> 00:01:52,644
The villagers are here
with pitchforks.

46
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:54,780
You're my lawyer.

47
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:56,615
Fix this!

48
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,420
Balloons!

49
00:02:01,422 --> 00:02:03,021
Balloon...!

50
00:02:04,158 --> 00:02:06,892
Here, balloons!

51
00:02:07,862 --> 00:02:09,962
Want a balloon?
What?

52
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:11,396
No. No, thank you. No.

53
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:13,332
Ronald danzer?

54
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:15,901
Who are you?

55
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:27,980
Help me!

56
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:29,882
That's ronald danzer.
Roll the camera!

57
00:02:29,884 --> 00:02:31,283
Roll the camera!

58
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:34,219
Help me...!

59
00:02:39,527 --> 00:02:40,993
In a bizarre turn of events,

60
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:44,363
A man appearing
to be ronald danzer is rising

61
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:47,432
Into the air above gotham,
attached to...

62
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:48,800
A weather balloon.

63
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:02,548
Cart was loaded
with bricks for ballast.

64
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,716
So, ronald danzer

65
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:06,652
Cheats half of gotham
out of their savings,

66
00:03:06,654 --> 00:03:08,153
But before he
can stand trial,

67
00:03:08,155 --> 00:03:10,055
An unknown man clips
him to a balloon?

68
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:11,890
No body?

69
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:13,258
We calling this a murder?

70
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,893
Call it a public service.

71
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:17,329
Danzer was a bum.
He got what he deserved.

72
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:19,064
I'm gonna go get a danish.

73
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:20,732
It's what i deserve.

74
00:03:26,307 --> 00:03:27,539
<i>Damn it!</i>

75
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,541
Somebody find me o'brian!

76
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,777
And get me some ice!

77
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:35,013
Who the hell are you?

78
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:36,815
Jim gordon.

79
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:39,818
Jim gordon. You're bullock's
new partner, hey?

80
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,755
Yeah. Lieutenant
bill cranston.

81
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:46,024
Yeah, bullock tells me
you're a real boy scout.

82
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:48,260
Don't think we should be
roughing up the skels?

83
00:03:48,262 --> 00:03:49,795
Well, they do have their rights.

84
00:03:49,797 --> 00:03:51,330
I'm gonna have
to remember that.

85
00:03:51,332 --> 00:03:53,198
Maybe i'll get that tattooed
on my ass.

86
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:55,968
Let me show you
something, gordon.

87
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,304
This was a gift

88
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:02,140
From the gotham chamber of
commerce for years of service.

89
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:03,842
I call him o'brian.

90
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:10,649
He also just happens to be the
best interrogator on the force.

91
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:12,918
Nice meeting
you, gordon.

92
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:17,889
Oh, luke, say hello
to sergeant o'brian.

93
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:19,258
No! No!

94
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:27,065
I just met
lieutenant cranston.

95
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:28,500
The man, the myth, the legend.

96
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:29,768
He's a thug.

97
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,304
So, no fingerprints,
and those carts

98
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:34,039
Are too easy to buy
or steal to trace.

99
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,941
How you coming on
those death threats?

100
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:37,609
I thought we talked about this.

101
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:38,777
Ronald danzer was murdered.

102
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,245
It's our job to catch murderers.

103
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:41,847
The guy was a crook.

104
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:43,248
Who had not been convicted
of any crime.

105
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,183
Tell that to the two guys
who killed themselves

106
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:46,818
Because he lost
their life savings.

107
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,687
This guy was living high
for 30 years

108
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:50,889
While the city kissed his ass
and gave him awards

109
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:52,324
For being such a philanthropist.

110
00:04:52,326 --> 00:04:53,825
So we just let
his killer go free.

111
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:56,795
Guy walks in here, holds out
his hands, i'll arrest him.

112
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:59,298
Otherwise, i'm content
justice was served.

113
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,732
Like with the waynes?
Is that what you mean?

114
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:02,868
Mario pepper killed the waynes.

115
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,403
We killed pepper.

116
00:05:04,405 --> 00:05:05,937
That case is closed.

117
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:08,173
Detective gordon?

118
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:09,841
Davis lamond
from juvenile services?

119
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:11,677
You asked to see selina kyle.

120
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:13,011
Could you sign for custody?

121
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:14,379
And when you finish,

122
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:16,548
You can bring her to our
new facility on water street.

123
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,984
She's scheduled to be
transferred upstate tomorrow.

124
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:20,186
Yeah, that's gonna be delayed.

125
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:21,867
She has information
about an investigation.

126
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,625
Would you mind... Stepping...
Back... A bit, please?

127
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:28,093
Wait a minute.

128
00:05:28,095 --> 00:05:30,395
Is that one of the kids
that was snatched?

129
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:32,731
Another closed case.

130
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:35,400
What is it about the word
"closed" you don't understand?

131
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:36,968
This is something else.

132
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,970
Just read the letters,
track the balloons.

133
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:40,205
I'll be back in an hour.

134
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:44,009
Yeah, boss.
Get right on it.

135
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:46,011
Where's my pen?

136
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:48,013
<i>So why do you care</i>

137
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:49,848
Who really
killed the waynes?

138
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,384
Because i want the person
responsible brought to justice.

139
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:55,520
Did you read that
in a book or something?

140
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:58,557
And...

141
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:01,026
I made a promise
to the boy.

142
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,761
So?

143
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:05,297
The killer came from there.

144
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:09,334
Took the man's wallet
and the woman's necklace.

145
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:11,403
Then shot them both.

146
00:06:11,405 --> 00:06:13,305
He left the boy alive.

147
00:06:13,307 --> 00:06:15,374
I was up there.

148
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:19,344
Everybody knows that much.

149
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:21,947
Plus, the killer's
face was covered.

150
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:23,248
Not at first.

151
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,883
He pulled up his scarf when

152
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,718
He walked toward them.
I saw him for a second.

153
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,787
You saw him...
Here... In the dark?

154
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:30,489
I can see in the dark.

155
00:06:32,126 --> 00:06:33,992
You don't believe me.

156
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:36,762
There's a question of whether
you're lying about what you saw,

157
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:39,097
And then there's the question
of whether you were even here.

158
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:40,899
You're not giving me proof.
I just told you,

159
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:43,168
I stole some chump's wallet
just before it happened.

160
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,936
That was, like,
two blocks from here.

161
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:46,004
Didn't he report it?

162
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:47,906
Yes, a man did report

163
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,474
His wallet stolen
by a thief

164
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:51,243
That matches your
description, and, yes,

165
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:53,445
The timing does work out to just
before the waynes were murdered.

166
00:06:53,447 --> 00:06:54,913
But that does not
place you here.

167
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:56,648
I dumped the wallet.

168
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:59,050
There.

169
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,053
The sewer.

170
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:05,190
Great.

171
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:07,759
It's not that i don't
trust you not to run away.

172
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,862
But, well... I don't.

173
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,734
You find the wallet,
you'll let me go, right?

174
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:17,335
That's the deal.
No.

175
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:20,172
Find the wallet,
that places you here.

176
00:07:20,174 --> 00:07:21,840
We still have to
find the guy.

177
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:22,842
That's bull!

178
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:23,843
That's the deal.

179
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:50,202
Oh, great.

180
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:08,954
Son of a bitch.
She was telling the truth.

181
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:12,357
Oh, detective?

182
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:16,528
You're gonna need these.

183
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:19,130
Hey!

184
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:21,233
Hey, wait a minute!

185
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:31,610
Lazlo, honey,

186
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:33,612
Take a rest.

187
00:08:33,614 --> 00:08:35,614
Poor thing.

188
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,583
Well, well, well.

189
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:41,019
Detectives montoya and allen.

190
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,954
To what do i owe this honor?

191
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:45,090
Thought we'd pay our respects.

192
00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:48,159
Maybe ask if you'd seen
your friend cobblepot around.

193
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:51,563
Hmm. Oswald. Hmm.

194
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:53,732
Now that you mention it,
i haven't

195
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:55,600
Seen him.

196
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:57,969
Isn't that funny?

197
00:08:57,971 --> 00:09:00,839
Almost as funny as two
detectives from major crimes

198
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:03,408
Looking for a nobody
like oswald.

199
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,410
Can we stop the dance?

200
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:07,379
He's dead, isn't he?

201
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:09,180
He was killed 'cause he told us

202
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:11,149
About pepper being framed
for the wayne murders.

203
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:12,751
He's dead.

204
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:17,355
But i didn't kill
the little snitch.

205
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:20,926
Word is,
jim gordon pulled the trigger.

206
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:25,797
You have proof?

207
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,966
What do i look like, a cop?

208
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:29,467
I only heard

209
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:32,904
That james gordon splattered
poor oswald's brains

210
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,439
All over gotham river.

211
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:37,542
Why would gordon want
to murder cobblepot? Huh?

212
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:39,277
Just to keep him quiet
about the frame?

213
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,513
Wrong question, gorgeous.

214
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:46,551
Jim gordon pulled the trigger,
but who gave the order?

215
00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:51,656
Who could make a cop commit
cold-blooded murder?

216
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:53,992
Falcone.

217
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:58,296
Your deductive powers
astonish me.

218
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:00,298
Honestly, i just got a chill.

219
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,667
You know, there's a
rumor going around that

220
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:06,938
Falcone gave your latest
boy-toy a nasty beating.

221
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,874
You wouldn't be looking for a
little revenge, now, would you?

222
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:13,878
I just want justice
for little oswald.

223
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:27,559
Hey, cobblepot.

224
00:10:27,561 --> 00:10:29,461
Hey, you're
supposed to be dead.

225
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,429
I'm afraid you have me confused.

226
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:33,531
My name is dimitri
from odessa.

227
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:35,533
I-i heard you got
whacked for ratting.

228
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:37,035
Yeah, fish is gonna pay

229
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:38,670
Some serious cash
for your skinny ass.

230
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:40,005
No, no, no, no!
No, please!

231
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:41,339
Please, please,
she'll kill me!

232
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:43,008
Why'd you even
come back, huh? Huh?

233
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,677
I-i could not stay away.
Gotham is my home!

234
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:46,978
It's my destiny!

235
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,780
You don't see
what's coming! I do!

236
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:50,615
Gotham needs me!
I am its future!

237
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:53,318
If you're its future,
then gotham is in big trouble.

238
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,286
Yes. Yes, it is.

239
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:17,509
Can i have a tuna
sandwich, please?

240
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:27,886
<i>Alfred, i don't want</i>
<i>to do this.</i>
<i>What?</i>

241
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:30,488
Stop. I don't want
to do this. Stop.
Come on. Swat.

242
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,857
En garde.

243
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:35,193
There you go, son.
What? What?

244
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,595
Is that all you got?
I'm not... Doing this.

245
00:11:37,597 --> 00:11:39,798
Uh... What?

246
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,666
There she blows,

247
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:43,735
The eye of the tiger
through the wind

248
00:11:43,737 --> 00:11:46,137
In your nostrils, sir bruce,

249
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:48,807
The blood in his veins.

250
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:51,142
That's it. Mind your head!

251
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:53,912
I do beg your pardon, sir.
I'm most...

252
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:56,781
Oi! Might be the bat.

253
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:58,216
Blood's up.

254
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,951
And hyah!

255
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:03,221
That's got to hurt.
No, not really.

256
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,155
Ooh.

257
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:06,758
I said stop!

258
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,494
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

259
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:10,695
Stop.
Down swords.

260
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:13,198
I surrender.

261
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,569
See?

262
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:18,603
A nice...

263
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:21,673
Sword fight gets your blood up,

264
00:12:21,675 --> 00:12:23,508
Doesn't it?

265
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:27,045
Better than reading
these dusty old files.

266
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:29,247
What is this, anyway?

267
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,682
Police file.

268
00:12:30,684 --> 00:12:33,685
About your mom and dad.
How'd you get these?

269
00:12:33,687 --> 00:12:36,521
Wasn't-wasn't hard.

270
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:39,090
Why would you want to look
at these? They're horrible.

271
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,359
They're gonna give you
nightmares.

272
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:43,862
I-i have those, anyway, and...

273
00:12:43,864 --> 00:12:45,663
I'm looking for clues.

274
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:47,098
What, so you're a detective now,
are you?

275
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,399
If i find a clue i am.

276
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:49,567
Have you found a clue?

277
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:53,204
Not yet.

278
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:54,439
Not yet?

279
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:59,677
Now, detective gordon
has promised you

280
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,479
That he will find the person
that killed your parents.

281
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:03,948
Do you really believe he will?

282
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,950
He will try.

283
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:08,119
Of that i am certain.

284
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:12,891
Yeah. Detective james gordon.

285
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:14,993
One of your counselors
brought me a girl this morning,

286
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:17,128
And i signed for custody.

287
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,630
That's what i'm saying.

288
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:20,498
I can't bring her back.
She got away.

289
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,569
Yeah? Well, i'm not
happy about it either.

290
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:27,572
On edge, gordon?

291
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:30,141
I'm fine.

292
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,676
How can i help you?

293
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:34,345
We were just,
uh, wondering

294
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:37,115
When you shot
cobblepot in the head

295
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:38,783
And dumped his
body in the river,

296
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:40,718
Did falcone pay you?

297
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,055
Or was that more of a "favor
to the don" type thing?

298
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:50,862
Whatever you heard,
it's not true.

299
00:13:50,864 --> 00:13:53,731
Oh, so you mean
you didn't kill cobblepot?

300
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:56,301
Or you didn't
do it for falcone?

301
00:13:56,303 --> 00:13:58,436
We thought we'd give you a
chance to tell us the truth.

302
00:13:58,438 --> 00:13:59,771
Cop to cop.

303
00:13:59,773 --> 00:14:01,739
You're not listening.
I didn't kill him.

304
00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:05,710
Okay, so where were you on the
night of september the 17th?

305
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:07,378
Are you really asking me this?

306
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,714
Since when did major crimes
become i.A.?

307
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:11,950
When cops started doing
hits for the mob.

308
00:14:11,952 --> 00:14:14,619
Yeah? Well, come back to me
when you have actual proof.

309
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:16,788
Until then,
don't waste my time.

310
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:19,424
Hey, gordon,
piece of advice:

311
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:20,558
Take a shower.

312
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,327
'cause you stink like a sewer.

313
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,266
Any job at all.
Even dishwasher.

314
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:29,268
We're staffed up.

315
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:31,736
I only ask a chance
to prove myself.

316
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:33,137
You ever work in a restaurant?

317
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:35,139
Not exactly...

318
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:36,541
Here, you're on your feet
all day.

319
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,643
You don't even have
the right shoes.

320
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:49,654
There you are.

321
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:50,888
I got the owner of a weather
balloon factory

322
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:53,291
Downstairs,
says he's got something for us.

323
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:56,027
Montoya and allen came by.

324
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:58,796
Accused me of killing cobblepot.
Damn.

325
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:00,398
Somebody
must've talked.
Doesn't matter.

326
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,000
The fact they're here means
they got nothing,

327
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:03,468
And they're gonna get nothing.

328
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:06,838
End of the day,
no one cares about cobblepot.

329
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,806
Because he deserved it.
Like ronald danzer.

330
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:09,741
Don't make this
into something bigger.

331
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:12,043
You did what
you had to do.

332
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:13,311
And, yes,
he probably did deserve it.

333
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:14,479
He worked for fish.

334
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:16,414
She doesn't employ altar boys.

335
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,882
What about mario pepper?
He deserve what he got?

336
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:18,884
Hell, yes.

337
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:20,351
He was a dirtbag.

338
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:22,687
He tried to shoot you, remember?

339
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:24,822
And i thought we were done
talking about this.

340
00:15:24,824 --> 00:15:26,291
We're done talking about this

341
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:27,825
When the person
who actually murdered

342
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:30,428
Thomas and martha wayne
is in jail,

343
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,597
Not the person we killed for it.

344
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:35,400
For the last time, gordon,
let it go.

345
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:36,868
Or what?

346
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,203
Am i gonna be the next person
taken out to the pier

347
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:40,605
To get a bullet in the head?

348
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:44,776
The interview's waiting.

349
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:58,489
Pardon me.

350
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:00,692
You work at that italian
restaurant across the way,

351
00:16:00,694 --> 00:16:02,160
Don't you?
Yeah.

352
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:05,330
And what size are your shoes?

353
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:07,598
Uh, nines.

354
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,600
What a coincidence!

355
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:14,038
When i saw that balloon
go up on tv,

356
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,440
I knew it was one of mine,

357
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:16,941
And i said to myself,
"jimmy boy,

358
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:18,343
"you better call the cops
right away,

359
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:20,778
Or they'll try
and pin this on you."

360
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,113
So it was you who called us.

361
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:23,648
And here i thought
my partner had gone

362
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,983
To the trouble
of tracking you down.

363
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:27,819
How exactly was one
of your balloons used to kill

364
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:31,422
Ronald danzer?
It was stole by my bum
of an ex-employee a month ago.

365
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:33,224
Carl smikers.

366
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:35,159
That's what i get
for hiring a kid.

367
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,327
Did he ever mention danzer?

368
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:37,795
Hell, no.

369
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:40,298
I'm surprised
he even knew who danzer was.

370
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,632
We ain't talking about

371
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:45,236
One of those intellectually
superior types here.

372
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:46,137
You got an address?

373
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:47,472
Yeah, but you find him,

374
00:16:47,474 --> 00:16:48,873
See you can get back the others.

375
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,041
The other what?

376
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:51,142
The other balloons.

377
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:53,478
A grand a pop those things are.

378
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,979
He stole four.

379
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,588
$47? Frankie,
i'm coming back next week.

380
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,523
Try to show some initiative,
all right?

381
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:08,192
Okay. Bill.

382
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,795
You're a disgrace
to drug dealers.

383
00:17:20,407 --> 00:17:21,739
Hot dog?

384
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:23,141
Get lost.

385
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:23,775
Hot dog?

386
00:17:23,777 --> 00:17:24,842
I said get lost!

387
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:25,943
Lieutenant cranston?

388
00:17:33,787 --> 00:17:35,953
All right.

389
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:42,293
Let's see...
Huh? Huh?

390
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:44,128
Let's see what we got here.

391
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,733
What the hell?

392
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:52,537
Who are you?

393
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:02,013
Oh, no.

394
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,454
No! No!

395
00:18:09,456 --> 00:18:13,091
No! No! No!

396
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:16,895
No!

397
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,307
Right.

398
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:33,444
So no breakfast then?

399
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,780
And no dinner last night?

400
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:37,782
What's the new program?

401
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:41,552
Trying to see how long we can
go without eating anything?

402
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:44,021
Right. If that's the case,
i should save myself the trouble

403
00:18:44,023 --> 00:18:47,225
Of making it.

404
00:18:47,227 --> 00:18:50,394
Have you seen this?

405
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:51,929
Oh, yeah, yeah.
That nutter going around

406
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:53,331
Offing people with balloons.

407
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:56,567
I can think of easier ways
to kill someone.

408
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:59,237
Master bruce, forgive me for...

409
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:02,974
Uttering the tired old words
"in times like these,"

410
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:06,644
But in times like these,

411
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:09,046
You really need
to keep your strength up.

412
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:13,618
I'm just not hungry.

413
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:31,769
Morning.

414
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:34,105
Hi. Thank you.

415
00:19:34,107 --> 00:19:35,773
I tried not to wake you.

416
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:38,042
It's fine.
I have a meeting.

417
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:40,578
Mm.
You okay?

418
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,913
You hardly slept last night.

419
00:19:41,915 --> 00:19:43,447
Just work.

420
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:45,216
This balloonman thing?

421
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:48,219
That's what the paper's
calling him.

422
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,223
And it says he killed a cop.

423
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,526
You're not in danger, are you?

424
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,628
You don't have to worry
about me.

425
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,230
Well, what is it then?

426
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:01,199
I can see
something's bothering you.

427
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:03,367
Yesterday,

428
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:06,604
The first victim,
ronald danzer,

429
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:07,905
Was a con man.

430
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:09,707
Nobody cared.

431
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:12,243
Now that a cop's
been targeted,

432
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:14,178
The investigation will get
all the support it needs.

433
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,047
It's not right.

434
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:18,449
Everyone has to matter
or nobody matters.

435
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:20,651
Otherwise people lose faith.

436
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:23,154
That's when you get vigilantes.

437
00:20:23,156 --> 00:20:24,822
But that isn't your fault.

438
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:27,925
I mean, if anything,
you're giving people faith.

439
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:29,594
Am i?

440
00:20:29,596 --> 00:20:31,062
How?

441
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:34,332
Your first case,
you caught the wayne killer.

442
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:39,837
Do you have any idea
what that meant for the city?

443
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:42,206
You're a hero.

444
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:46,043
I gotta go.

445
00:20:50,183 --> 00:20:53,651
<i>Don't matter if you a cop.
You dirty,</i>

446
00:20:53,653 --> 00:20:54,986
The balloonman gonna get you.

447
00:20:54,988 --> 00:20:56,988
It's time the people
of gotham realize

448
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:59,257
That they have to stand up
for themselves.

449
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:02,426
Hey, balloonman ought
to get to my landlord next.

450
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:05,696
He's a crook.
And his name is harold bl...

451
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:07,698
This is wonderful.
This is like...

452
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,867
My dream of how today
was gonna go.

453
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:11,369
Besides the black eye
to the department,

454
00:21:11,371 --> 00:21:14,538
Now we have a vigilante
who kills bad cops.

455
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,040
Cranston wasn't that bad.

456
00:21:16,042 --> 00:21:17,742
But whatever he was
or wasn't guilty of,

457
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:20,211
Cranston was a
lieutenant in the gcpd.

458
00:21:20,213 --> 00:21:22,280
You don't get
to go around killing cops.

459
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:24,048
So where are you on this

460
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:26,651
And the danzer murder?
We're looking for a man
named carl smikers.

461
00:21:26,653 --> 00:21:28,152
He was an employee
at the factory

462
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:30,021
Where the balloons
were stolen.

463
00:21:30,023 --> 00:21:31,522
We have uniforms
staking out his apartment,

464
00:21:31,524 --> 00:21:33,291
But he hasn't been back there
since last night.

465
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:34,625
And you like him for this?

466
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:35,793
Oh, he's guilty.

467
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:37,695
Leave me in a room with him,
he'll be guilty.

468
00:21:37,697 --> 00:21:39,697
He's definitely connected,
but i'm not sure he's the one.

469
00:21:39,699 --> 00:21:40,931
He had weather balloons!

470
00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:42,600
Cranston and danzer were killed
with weather balloons!

471
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:43,768
He's the guy!

472
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,936
Smikers never
graduated high school.

473
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:48,773
He's never held a job for more
than a year, he's got busts

474
00:21:48,775 --> 00:21:50,007
For soliciting, possession.

475
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:51,876
Tell her
about the other balloons.

476
00:21:51,878 --> 00:21:53,678
What other balloons?

477
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:57,148
Smikers' boss mentioned that
four balloons are missing.

478
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,949
There are two of
them still out there.

479
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:00,985
So two more targets?

480
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:02,953
We have any sense
who they might be?

481
00:22:02,955 --> 00:22:05,222
Danzer and cranston
were both known figures,

482
00:22:05,224 --> 00:22:06,957
And known to be dirty.

483
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:09,427
Killer didn't need any special
knowledge to target them,

484
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:11,662
So, it's likely the
next target is public

485
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:13,130
And known to be corrupt.

486
00:22:13,132 --> 00:22:14,565
Basically,
every elected official

487
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:16,500
In gotham should stay indoors.

488
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:19,537
Find him. Now.

489
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:20,705
We will.

490
00:22:20,707 --> 00:22:23,040
<i>We</i> will?

491
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:25,476
What happened to the killer
doing the city a favor?

492
00:22:25,478 --> 00:22:27,345
You're gonna make me
think you actually care.

493
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:29,480
Listen, smartass, you want
to kill a corrupt financier,

494
00:22:29,482 --> 00:22:30,614
Be my guest.

495
00:22:30,616 --> 00:22:33,317
You kill a cop,
it's a job safety issue.

496
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:34,719
We need a plan.
Relax.

497
00:22:34,721 --> 00:22:37,888
One thing i do know
is how to find someone.

498
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,461
Maybe later tonight.

499
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,047
Here you go.
Beautiful, baby.

500
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:04,949
There you go.
Hmm?

501
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:10,955
Hey!

502
00:23:10,957 --> 00:23:13,491
Hey! Yo!

503
00:23:13,493 --> 00:23:15,192
What did he tell you?

504
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:17,528
Nothing.
I was just hungry.

505
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:19,597
Oh! Mmm!

506
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,470
You wash dishes,

507
00:23:26,472 --> 00:23:28,205
Mop the floor,
take out the trash.

508
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:31,375
Otherwise, you're deaf,
dumb and blind.

509
00:23:31,377 --> 00:23:34,678
I understand.
No, you don't,
but you will.

510
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,881
This ain't like other places,
and you'll either get it...

511
00:23:36,883 --> 00:23:39,116
Or i'll be fired?

512
00:23:39,118 --> 00:23:41,118
You could say that.

513
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,053
Oh, you have nothing
to worry about.

514
00:23:43,055 --> 00:23:44,455
I know that this is

515
00:23:44,457 --> 00:23:45,689
A great opportunity.

516
00:23:45,691 --> 00:23:48,859
Don maroni!

517
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:49,960
Good to see you.

518
00:23:49,962 --> 00:23:50,961
Doing good?
Welcome. Welcome.

519
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:52,696
All right.

520
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:55,299
Great.
A great opportunity, indeed.

521
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:00,304
So, our suspect had a prior for
soliciting two years ago, right?

522
00:24:00,306 --> 00:24:02,740
So, one of my girls thought
he looked familiar,

523
00:24:02,742 --> 00:24:04,308
Remembered he liked
big, brawny types.

524
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,310
So, she pointed me to that pimp,

525
00:24:06,312 --> 00:24:08,179
That guy
who specialized in that.

526
00:24:08,181 --> 00:24:10,581
He remembered...
After you roughed
him up a little.

527
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:12,183
...That he used to do deliveries

528
00:24:12,185 --> 00:24:14,919
For this, uh,
dry cleaner, mr. Chang.

529
00:24:14,921 --> 00:24:16,587
And he remembered,
on top of everything else,

530
00:24:16,589 --> 00:24:17,988
The guy was a mahjong guy.

531
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:20,324
He was into these chinese
bookies for, like, five grand.

532
00:24:20,326 --> 00:24:21,559
And they sent you here.

533
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:22,927
By way of some bike messengers,

534
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:24,995
The guy that runs
pickpockets on the south side,

535
00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:27,932
And a pot sticker joint
the guy apparently loved.

536
00:24:29,168 --> 00:24:31,235
Dragon palace.

537
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:33,938
We didn't order any...

538
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,005
Carl smikers?

539
00:24:36,776 --> 00:24:37,776
Run!

540
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:42,413
Gcpd! You're under arrest!

541
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:50,955
Stop, or i'll...

542
00:24:51,591 --> 00:24:53,724
Don't move.

543
00:24:54,694 --> 00:24:57,261
Jim, a little help!

544
00:24:58,431 --> 00:24:59,597
Put it down!

545
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:01,699
Put it down now!

546
00:25:17,116 --> 00:25:20,084
<i>You put the mcu
onto that cop killing oswald.</i>

547
00:25:20,086 --> 00:25:23,087
Falcone finds out it
came from you... I mean,

548
00:25:23,089 --> 00:25:26,390
I don't mind what he did
to me, it's, uh...

549
00:25:26,392 --> 00:25:28,659
Lazlo, honey,

550
00:25:28,661 --> 00:25:30,995
You're worried about me,
aren't you?

551
00:25:35,935 --> 00:25:38,002
But you must remember,

552
00:25:38,004 --> 00:25:42,072
It wasn't you
falcone wanted to hurt.

553
00:25:42,074 --> 00:25:44,375
It was me.

554
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:46,944
Understand?

555
00:26:00,993 --> 00:26:02,326
The boy's lost his spine.

556
00:26:04,263 --> 00:26:06,697
Not everyone's built
for a beating like that.

557
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,868
What's that new piece
that the roman's been seeing...

558
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:13,337
What's her name...
natalia? Nadia?

559
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:15,239
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

560
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:18,108
Tell butch
she's going to have an accident.

561
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,177
Such a shame.

562
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:22,780
She was a pretty girl.

563
00:26:22,782 --> 00:26:25,649
And get rid of lazlo
while you're at it.

564
00:26:25,651 --> 00:26:27,418
He's bringing down the mood.

565
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,820
With pleasure.

566
00:26:39,432 --> 00:26:40,698
My god!

567
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,533
Sorry. I knocked, but i could
hear someone in here, and...

568
00:26:42,535 --> 00:26:43,801
How did you get in?

569
00:26:43,803 --> 00:26:45,202
I still have a key, remember?

570
00:26:45,204 --> 00:26:47,104
And you just let yourself in?

571
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:49,039
Give it to me.

572
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:51,108
I could have you arrested.

573
00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:54,011
Or i could arrest you.

574
00:26:54,013 --> 00:26:56,547
It's kind of early
to get high, isn't it?

575
00:26:56,549 --> 00:26:58,949
It's been a stressful day.

576
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,184
And is that all you're doing?

577
00:27:00,186 --> 00:27:03,220
Afraid so.
Disappointed?

578
00:27:03,222 --> 00:27:04,755
Don't play with me, barbara.

579
00:27:04,757 --> 00:27:06,490
I was there, remember?

580
00:27:06,492 --> 00:27:08,692
Through all of it.
Don't you mean
you were a part of it?

581
00:27:08,694 --> 00:27:10,694
Fine.

582
00:27:10,696 --> 00:27:12,162
Answer the question.

583
00:27:12,164 --> 00:27:14,498
Yes. This is it.

584
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,401
And now that you've broken
into my home and accused me

585
00:27:17,403 --> 00:27:19,536
Of being a drug addict,
you can leave.

586
00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:20,838
Not until we talk about gordon.

587
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,006
He's killed a man.

588
00:27:22,008 --> 00:27:23,474
You told me.
It's not true.

589
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:25,476
Not mario pepper,
another man.

590
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:28,679
And he killed him on the
orders of carmine falcone,

591
00:27:28,681 --> 00:27:30,014
Biggest crime
boss in gotham.

592
00:27:30,016 --> 00:27:32,082
You're lying.

593
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:35,219
But, you know, i guess
i should be used to that.

594
00:27:35,221 --> 00:27:37,254
True.

595
00:27:37,256 --> 00:27:40,157
When we were together,
i did lie to you.

596
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,960
A lot.

597
00:27:42,962 --> 00:27:44,662
But you always knew.

598
00:27:44,664 --> 00:27:48,966
You looked in my eyes, and you
knew when i was lying to you.

599
00:27:51,671 --> 00:27:54,204
Am i lying now?

600
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:58,142
Is it just because i love him?

601
00:27:58,144 --> 00:28:03,147
Is that why you are
so determined to destroy him?

602
00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:05,449
I've been sober for a year.

603
00:28:05,451 --> 00:28:08,852
Look, and i know that doesn't
erase the things that i did.

604
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:13,857
But i still care about you.

605
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:16,960
I can't stand you
being with this man.

606
00:28:16,962 --> 00:28:19,697
You deserve better.

607
00:28:26,972 --> 00:28:29,039
Leave.

608
00:28:31,343 --> 00:28:33,977
Now.

609
00:28:39,785 --> 00:28:41,652
Ask him where he was the night

610
00:28:41,654 --> 00:28:43,587
That oswald cobblepot
disappeared.

611
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:46,790
That's the name of
the man he killed.

612
00:28:52,932 --> 00:28:55,099
I-i'm telling the truth,
i didn't kill those guys.

613
00:28:55,101 --> 00:28:58,035
I mean, a cop?!
Why would i kill a cop?!

614
00:28:58,037 --> 00:29:01,205
Maybe because you're a thieving,
cop-murdering pile of crap.

615
00:29:01,207 --> 00:29:02,973
But, mind you,
that's just a theory.

616
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:04,742
You admit
stealing the balloons.

617
00:29:04,744 --> 00:29:06,744
Yeah. Yeah, but i owed
these loan sharks,

618
00:29:06,746 --> 00:29:09,480
And-and if i didn't pay 'em,
they were gonna cut off stuff.

619
00:29:09,482 --> 00:29:12,449
So if you didn't kill
danzer and cranston, who did?

620
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:13,550
Who'd you sell the balloons to?

621
00:29:13,552 --> 00:29:15,419
I never saw his face.

622
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:18,489
We had a drop-off point to
exchange the balloons and money.

623
00:29:18,491 --> 00:29:21,925
You know what we got here, jim?
We got us a criminal

624
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:24,294
Mastermind, hmm?
Not only

625
00:29:24,296 --> 00:29:26,063
Is the murder weapon
in the stratosphere,

626
00:29:26,065 --> 00:29:27,331
But so are the bodies.

627
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:28,632
It's the perfect crime!

628
00:29:28,634 --> 00:29:31,168
The bodies will come back.

629
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,006
What are you talking about?

630
00:29:36,008 --> 00:29:38,442
Do you guys not know
how weather balloons work?

631
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:41,345
Tell us, genius,
or i'll beat it out of you.

632
00:29:41,347 --> 00:29:42,613
Wait, wait, wait! Okay.

633
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:44,148
They-they rise up,
and-and it gets

634
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:46,850
Colder and colder,
and the balloon gets brittle,

635
00:29:46,852 --> 00:29:48,452
And the helium expands.

636
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:49,686
Then what?

637
00:29:49,688 --> 00:29:51,555
It pops.

638
00:30:00,332 --> 00:30:01,999
Oy...

639
00:30:02,001 --> 00:30:06,804
I'm really starting
to dislike this case.

640
00:30:06,806 --> 00:30:10,474
Where do you think
they find shovels that big, huh?

641
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:12,409
We only have to worry
about one more balloon.

642
00:30:12,411 --> 00:30:14,077
Who?
Cardinal quinn.

643
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:15,712
He was meditating
in his garden.

644
00:30:15,714 --> 00:30:17,648
Alvarez is on his
way to the scene.

645
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:20,017
Now we're gonna have
the church on our back. Great.

646
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:21,285
Forget the fact

647
00:30:21,287 --> 00:30:24,154
That quinn was known
as the diddling priest.

648
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:26,156
Here's what we found
in cranston's pockets.

649
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:28,392
What wasn't
smashed to bits.

650
00:30:30,062 --> 00:30:32,162
Why's your name on this, jim?

651
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:41,939
I know who the balloonman is.

652
00:30:46,245 --> 00:30:47,911
<i>You see, falcone is
only the boss</i>

653
00:30:47,913 --> 00:30:51,215
Of gotham because people
believe he's the boss.

654
00:30:51,217 --> 00:30:53,483
That's what this arkham thing is
gonna change.

655
00:30:53,485 --> 00:30:56,753
People are gonna see that
the emperor's got no clothes.

656
00:30:56,755 --> 00:30:58,922
I'm wasting my breath.
You're an idiot.

657
00:30:58,924 --> 00:31:00,424
Get out of here.

658
00:31:02,661 --> 00:31:03,927
Who the hell are you?

659
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:05,295
Uh, i-i'm sorry, sir.

660
00:31:05,297 --> 00:31:06,597
I'm...
Hold on.

661
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:08,599
Put that down.

662
00:31:08,601 --> 00:31:10,901
You were listening, huh?
You're new.

663
00:31:10,903 --> 00:31:12,903
What's your name?
Paolo, sir.

664
00:31:12,905 --> 00:31:16,006
Italian.
You don't look italian.

665
00:31:16,008 --> 00:31:17,674
Well, on my mother's side.

666
00:31:17,676 --> 00:31:19,910
It's the side that i claim.

667
00:31:19,912 --> 00:31:21,745
A boy who loves his mother.

668
00:31:24,283 --> 00:31:26,917
Here you go.

669
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:28,785
Take it.

670
00:31:28,787 --> 00:31:30,153
I was a lot like you.

671
00:31:30,155 --> 00:31:32,155
Started from nothing.

672
00:31:32,157 --> 00:31:35,325
But i kept my head down,
i worked hard, now look at me.

673
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:38,195
Gotham is the city
of opportunity.

674
00:31:38,197 --> 00:31:40,530
Yes, sir.
I believe that, too.

675
00:31:40,532 --> 00:31:42,432
You hear what i
was saying back there?

676
00:31:42,434 --> 00:31:45,736
Falcone, arkham...

677
00:31:45,738 --> 00:31:47,671
They mean
anything to you?

678
00:31:47,673 --> 00:31:50,874
Honestly, sir...
I didn't hear anything at all.

679
00:31:50,876 --> 00:31:52,509
That a boy.

680
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:54,411
The balloonman has struck

681
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:56,480
Once again.
Cardinal quinn, accused

682
00:31:56,482 --> 00:31:58,248
Of multiple counts
of sexual abuse,

683
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:01,184
Is the latest victim
of the vigilante.

684
00:32:01,186 --> 00:32:04,354
See this...
This is not good.

685
00:32:04,356 --> 00:32:06,423
You can't go around
killing priests.

686
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:09,393
At least not in public.

687
00:32:10,863 --> 00:32:13,630
Got take care of
your mother, paolo.

688
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:18,702
<i>His name is davis lamond; 48.</i>

689
00:32:18,704 --> 00:32:21,238
He's worked at juvenile services
for 15 years.

690
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,306
No priors.

691
00:32:22,308 --> 00:32:23,974
He didn't show up
for work today,

692
00:32:23,976 --> 00:32:25,809
And hasn't been back
to his apartment.

693
00:32:25,811 --> 00:32:27,144
We have uniforms at both.

694
00:32:27,146 --> 00:32:29,146
And you're positive
he's the killer?

695
00:32:29,148 --> 00:32:31,815
We found a form on cranston's
body that i'd given lamond

696
00:32:31,817 --> 00:32:33,517
Yesterday morning.

697
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,819
Also keys that opened
lamond's apartment.

698
00:32:35,821 --> 00:32:37,287
I'm guessing they had a scuffle,

699
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:38,822
Cranston went through
his pockets,

700
00:32:38,824 --> 00:32:40,691
But lamond managed
to attach him to the balloon.

701
00:32:40,693 --> 00:32:43,560
So what caused
lamond to snap?

702
00:32:43,562 --> 00:32:45,562
Not sure.

703
00:32:45,564 --> 00:32:48,966
Lamond's coworkers describe
him as thoughtful, dedicated,

704
00:32:48,968 --> 00:32:50,567
Sweet... a few said that.

705
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:53,136
Oh, great, one of those sweet
cop-killing vigilantes.

706
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:55,639
And what about his last target?

707
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:57,808
Same profile as all the rest.

708
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:59,176
Well known.

709
00:32:59,178 --> 00:33:00,510
Seemingly respectable.

710
00:33:00,512 --> 00:33:01,812
Actually corrupt.

711
00:33:01,814 --> 00:33:03,113
This is gotham.

712
00:33:03,115 --> 00:33:05,048
That doesn't exactly
narrow it down.

713
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:07,351
Meanwhile, i have the mayor,
city council,

714
00:33:07,353 --> 00:33:08,885
Half the city's judges

715
00:33:08,887 --> 00:33:11,488
And clergy hiding indoors
screaming at the commissioner

716
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:14,057
To find the guy.
And guess who he screams at?

717
00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:15,425
We've got his photo out there.

718
00:33:15,427 --> 00:33:16,760
It's just a matter of time.

719
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,266
Nothing.

720
00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:24,434
Really?

721
00:33:24,436 --> 00:33:26,603
Your network of chinese
loan sharks and hookers

722
00:33:26,605 --> 00:33:27,704
Came up empty?

723
00:33:27,706 --> 00:33:29,940
Gloat later.
Let's think about it.

724
00:33:29,942 --> 00:33:31,441
He had to store the balloons,

725
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:34,478
The helium canisters,
the carts he was using...

726
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,613
Uh, maybe a storage facility.

727
00:33:36,615 --> 00:33:37,981
A warehouse.

728
00:33:37,983 --> 00:33:40,951
Or an abandoned building.

729
00:33:40,953 --> 00:33:41,953
That's it?

730
00:33:41,954 --> 00:33:43,086
How'd you come up with that?

731
00:33:43,088 --> 00:33:44,955
It's the same thing i just said.

732
00:33:48,927 --> 00:33:51,228
What made you figure
this place?

733
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:53,130
The girl yesterday,
selina,

734
00:33:53,132 --> 00:33:55,599
She told me she was
in a new juvie building.

735
00:33:55,601 --> 00:33:58,268
Lamond, the counselor, said
the same thing, so i'm thinking

736
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:00,737
What happened
to the old juvie building?

737
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:03,373
Turns out... City's
getting ready to demo it.

738
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:06,309
Look, even if he was here,
he's probably long gone.

739
00:34:06,311 --> 00:34:07,577
He's only got
one balloon left.

740
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:09,479
He knows we're closing in.

741
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:13,517
Or that's it right there.

742
00:34:57,796 --> 00:34:59,362
Bullock!

743
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:05,902
Drop the gun! Now!

744
00:35:05,904 --> 00:35:08,438
I can't do that, detective.
I'm not done yet.

745
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,639
Drop it.

746
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:10,807
You should be
helping me.

747
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:11,942
You're wasting your breath.

748
00:35:11,944 --> 00:35:13,376
My partner here
thinks you're as bad

749
00:35:13,378 --> 00:35:14,678
As the scum you kill.

750
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,646
Me, i can see how you're
kind of doing us a favor.

751
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:18,381
So don't shoot me,
all right?

752
00:35:18,383 --> 00:35:20,317
You believe as i do.

753
00:35:20,319 --> 00:35:22,752
I know you're the one who
caught those child snatchers.

754
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:24,855
You risked your life.
Uh, so did i.

755
00:35:24,857 --> 00:35:26,857
You want to protect
the innocent?

756
00:35:26,859 --> 00:35:28,992
Yes. And we have laws for that.

757
00:35:28,994 --> 00:35:30,994
And what good are
laws when they require

758
00:35:30,996 --> 00:35:34,030
Men like your lieutenant
cranston to implement them?

759
00:35:34,032 --> 00:35:36,066
And ronald danzer...
you really think

760
00:35:36,068 --> 00:35:37,934
He would've ever seen
the inside of a jail?

761
00:35:37,936 --> 00:35:39,202
Or that priest?

762
00:35:39,204 --> 00:35:41,371
Why didn't the law punish him?

763
00:35:42,608 --> 00:35:44,608
You know, i have given my life

764
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:46,476
To the lost children of gotham

765
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:48,011
Because i wanted
to make a difference.

766
00:35:48,013 --> 00:35:51,081
And you know what
kind of difference i made? None.

767
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:52,816
Because the people
running this city

768
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:55,552
Feed off the weak and
the law protects them.

769
00:35:55,554 --> 00:35:58,488
And when your mayor rounded up
all those children

770
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,590
To send off to that
prison upstate,

771
00:36:00,592 --> 00:36:03,226
I decided "no more."

772
00:36:03,228 --> 00:36:06,096
I would teach them
there are consequences.

773
00:36:06,098 --> 00:36:09,132
So why don't you ask
yourself, detective:

774
00:36:09,134 --> 00:36:11,134
Who are you fighting for?

775
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:13,069
A mayor in the mob's pocket?

776
00:36:13,071 --> 00:36:14,971
Cops on the take?

777
00:36:14,973 --> 00:36:18,108
Or for the weak
and the innocent?

778
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,976
Who are you, finally?

779
00:36:22,214 --> 00:36:23,647
Aw, forget it.

780
00:36:32,324 --> 00:36:33,823
No, no! Aah!

781
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,792
What're you doing?

782
00:36:35,794 --> 00:36:37,527
How do you like that?
Grab him!

783
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:39,896
How's it feel? You're hoisted
by your own petard.

784
00:36:42,668 --> 00:36:44,234
No, jim.

785
00:36:44,236 --> 00:36:46,570
Jim, what are you doing?

786
00:36:46,572 --> 00:36:47,871
Jim, let go.

787
00:36:47,873 --> 00:36:49,673
Shoot it! Shoot the balloon!

788
00:36:49,675 --> 00:36:50,740
Jim!

789
00:36:50,742 --> 00:36:51,775
Let go!

790
00:36:51,777 --> 00:36:53,810
Shoot it!

791
00:36:53,812 --> 00:36:55,412
Just let go!

792
00:36:55,414 --> 00:36:57,080
Shoot it, now!

793
00:37:22,374 --> 00:37:24,207
Carmine.

794
00:37:24,209 --> 00:37:26,509
What a lovely surprise.

795
00:37:26,511 --> 00:37:29,446
We're not quite open,
but for you...

796
00:37:29,448 --> 00:37:30,981
Hello, fish.

797
00:37:30,983 --> 00:37:32,415
Just stopped by
on my way to dinner.

798
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:34,284
I wanted to make sure
there were no hard feelings.

799
00:37:34,286 --> 00:37:35,286
Mm.

800
00:37:35,287 --> 00:37:37,787
Never.

801
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:39,589
That's my girl.

802
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:42,125
Speaking of your girl,
that better be the reason

803
00:37:42,127 --> 00:37:44,327
Why you're ditching me tonight.

804
00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:46,029
What's her name again?

805
00:37:46,031 --> 00:37:47,097
Nadia?

806
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:48,932
Natalia.

807
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:50,934
And no.
She had an accident.

808
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:52,669
I hope nothing serious.

809
00:37:52,671 --> 00:37:54,204
A mugging.

810
00:37:54,206 --> 00:37:56,339
Mugging?!

811
00:37:56,341 --> 00:37:57,841
Ever since the waynes
were killed,

812
00:37:57,843 --> 00:37:59,175
The city has gone crazy.

813
00:38:00,746 --> 00:38:04,481
I hope the punk who did it
paid with his life.

814
00:38:04,483 --> 00:38:06,850
He will.
When we find him.

815
00:38:06,852 --> 00:38:09,219
Along with anyone
who helped him.

816
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:16,660
Are you hearing any rumblings
from maroni's camp?

817
00:38:16,662 --> 00:38:18,595
You don't actually
believe that maroni

818
00:38:18,597 --> 00:38:20,563
Had something to
do with it, do you?

819
00:38:20,565 --> 00:38:22,065
Like you say:

820
00:38:22,067 --> 00:38:25,669
People are acting crazy,
and crazy's bad for business.

821
00:38:25,671 --> 00:38:27,904
Especially with everything
on the horizon.

822
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,207
You're talking about arkham.

823
00:38:31,209 --> 00:38:33,610
I thought you had
that locked up.

824
00:38:33,612 --> 00:38:36,146
Mm.

825
00:38:36,148 --> 00:38:37,647
Keep your eyes open.

826
00:38:46,391 --> 00:38:49,759
Hold on. Hold on.

827
00:38:49,761 --> 00:38:52,662
Give me a second.

828
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:54,497
There will be more

829
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:57,334
Like me, detective.

830
00:38:57,336 --> 00:38:59,002
You know that, don't you?

831
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:01,438
Not if we do our job.

832
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,973
And we will. I will.

833
00:39:03,975 --> 00:39:05,975
You had your chance.

834
00:39:05,977 --> 00:39:08,111
All of you.

835
00:39:08,113 --> 00:39:10,113
Who was your last target?

836
00:39:13,485 --> 00:39:15,719
The crusade of the vigilante
known as the balloonman

837
00:39:15,721 --> 00:39:18,421
Ended tonight when he was
apprehended by police.

838
00:39:18,423 --> 00:39:20,323
He was one man who stood up
to the corruption

839
00:39:20,325 --> 00:39:22,425
Eating at the heart of gotham,
willing to break the law

840
00:39:22,427 --> 00:39:24,160
In order to save it.

841
00:39:24,162 --> 00:39:26,496
Well, i imagine the
criminals of gotham

842
00:39:26,498 --> 00:39:28,098
Are sleeping
well tonight.

843
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,133
He killed people.

844
00:39:30,135 --> 00:39:33,203
That made him a criminal, too.

845
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:35,405
That's very true.

846
00:39:35,407 --> 00:39:37,874
Can i get you anything else?

847
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:39,542
No, thank you, alfred.

848
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:41,878
Right, well, you know...

849
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,347
Do try and eat a bit, won't you?

850
00:39:44,349 --> 00:39:46,349
Be a shame to have you
floating away.

851
00:39:46,351 --> 00:39:48,351
...The gcpd claims a win,

852
00:39:48,353 --> 00:39:50,687
But this journalist
is left to wonder:

853
00:39:50,689 --> 00:39:52,322
Now that the balloonman is gone,

854
00:39:52,324 --> 00:39:54,824
Who will defend
the people of gotham?

855
00:39:54,826 --> 00:39:57,127
This is channel 7 at 7:00,
reporting live

856
00:39:57,129 --> 00:39:58,628
From the former gotham

857
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:01,364
Juvenile facility center
in downtown,

858
00:40:01,366 --> 00:40:03,500
With your
minute-to-minute updates.

859
00:40:03,502 --> 00:40:05,568
Back to the newsroom, john.

860
00:40:23,355 --> 00:40:26,456
You're okay.

861
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,260
Are you okay?

862
00:40:30,262 --> 00:40:31,928
Yeah.

863
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,863
I fell is all. I'm fine.

864
00:40:41,206 --> 00:40:43,273
What's wrong?

865
00:40:45,911 --> 00:40:47,977
I want you to know

866
00:40:47,979 --> 00:40:50,280
That you can tell me anything.

867
00:40:52,217 --> 00:40:54,284
The city's sick.

868
00:40:56,087 --> 00:40:58,154
Sick in a way
i hadn't realized.

869
00:41:02,127 --> 00:41:03,693
When they were taking him away,

870
00:41:03,695 --> 00:41:05,962
This balloonman killer,

871
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:08,331
I asked who his last target was.

872
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:11,167
You know what he said?

873
00:41:11,169 --> 00:41:13,303
Doesn't matter.

874
00:41:15,874 --> 00:41:18,141
He meant the mayor, judges,

875
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:20,009
Anyone in a position of power...

876
00:41:20,011 --> 00:41:21,511
They're all guilty.

877
00:41:21,513 --> 00:41:24,347
But that's not true.

878
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:25,882
It's how he feels.

879
00:41:25,884 --> 00:41:27,484
It's how they all feel.

880
00:41:27,486 --> 00:41:28,751
Everyone.

881
00:41:28,753 --> 00:41:31,855
That's why the city
embraced him.

882
00:41:31,857 --> 00:41:35,658
Because we let them down.

883
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:38,561
But if people take the law
into their own hands,

884
00:41:38,563 --> 00:41:40,697
Then there is no law.

885
00:41:40,699 --> 00:41:43,733
And we're lost.

886
00:41:47,305 --> 00:41:48,838
There are cops who do it.

887
00:41:50,942 --> 00:41:53,476
The same thing he did.

888
00:41:55,881 --> 00:41:57,113
But you never would.

889
00:41:58,383 --> 00:42:00,450
Do you think i could?

890
00:42:03,755 --> 00:42:05,121
No.

891
00:42:08,393 --> 00:42:10,393
I know you,

892
00:42:10,395 --> 00:42:12,462
Jim gordon.

893
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:16,099
And i love you.

894
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:25,041
And now i'm gonna
get you a drink.

895
00:42:31,816 --> 00:42:33,349
I'll get it.

896
00:42:42,527 --> 00:42:44,093
Jim.

897
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:48,464
Hello, james.

898
00:42:48,466 --> 00:42:50,133
Old friend.
