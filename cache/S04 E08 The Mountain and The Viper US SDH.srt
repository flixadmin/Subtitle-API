- You fucking deaf?
- ( laughing )

10
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:38,283
Same wrong guess
every fucking time.

11
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:39,951
Listen, you cunt.

12
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:42,120
Oh!

( cheering )

16
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:50,628
There's a man
with an ear.

17
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:53,047
Too bad you got
a hangnail for a cock.

18

( laughs )

19
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:57,051
First time I saw you
with your breeches down,

20
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,720
I thought you were
a eunuch.

21
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:01,222
- ( laughing )
- You've seen it, girls.

22
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:05,101
Like a baby snail
peeking out of his shell.

23
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:07,437

24
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:20,909
Your baby was crying
this morning.

25
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,750
Woke me up.

26
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,293
You hear me?

27
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,836
Yes.

28
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,297
Well, got
anything to say?

29
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,299
I'm sorry
he woke you up.

30
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:39,677
( chuckles )
I don't care
if you're sorry.

31
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,221
Keep that baby quiet

32
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,098
or I will.

33
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,767
Don't you
ever touch him.

34
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,685
( chuckles )

35
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,938

39
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,947
- Shut your mouth.
- What?

<i>( owl hoots )</i>

41
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,868
It's just an owl,
you dumb bitch.

42
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,079
No, it's not.

<i>( screaming continues )</i>

I should never
have left her there.

58
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:59,650
- You couldn't have known.
- Of course I could've known.

59
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:02,070
They've been raiding
the villages close by.

60
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,405
And we just cower
in here while they
slaughter our brothers.

61
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,741
Our brothers had orders
to stay at Castle Black.

62
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:09,285
So it's all right, then?
Black Jack and Kegs

63
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:11,204
and Mully chopped to pieces
'cause they broke the rules?

64
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:12,789
Dolorous Edd:
<i>I didn't say it</i>
<i>was all right.</i>

65
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,791
I'm saying they shouldn't
have been there.

66
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,001
We're pledged to guard
the realms of men.

67
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,461
She's dead because of me.

68
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:19,962
We can't even guard
Mole's Town.

69
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,923
We can't go after them.
You know that.

70
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:23,341
It's what they want.

71
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,551
And little Sam.

72
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:28,679
As if I cut
their throats myself.

73
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,098
Maybe she managed
to hide herself.

74
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,933
<i>I thought</i>
<i>all of you was dead.</i>

75
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:34,185
You went north with Mormont
and no one came back.

76
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:36,270
Not for ages.

77
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,314
But then you did.

78
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:41,484
She survived Craster

79
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:44,070
and he was the worst
shit I've ever met.

80
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:45,988
She survived the long march
to the Wall.

81
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:49,826
<i>She survived a white walker,</i>
<i>for fuck's sake.</i>

82
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:52,745
She might have got out.

83
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,291
She might have.

84
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:01,003
If they hit Mole's Town,

85
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,089
then we're next.

86
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,136
Mance and his army
must be close.

87
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,595
Grenn:
<i>100,000 of them.</i>

88
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,140
And there's what,
105 of us left?

89
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:15,017
You counting Black Jack,
Kegs, and Mully?

90
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,062
102.

91
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:21,357
How do 102 men
stop 100,000?

92
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,947
Whoever dies last,
be a good lad

93
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,366
<i>and burn the rest of us.</i>

94
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:32,994
Once I'm done
with this world,

95
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:35,329
I don't want
to come back.

96
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:38,059
Daenerys:
<i>You think he was</i>
<i>spying on you?</i>

97
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,019
Missandei:
<i>No, not spying.</i>

98
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,063
Daenerys:
<i>The Dothraki think</i>
<i>outsiders are ridiculous</i>

99
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,773
taking shame
in the naked body.

100
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:47,068
They make love under
the stars for the whole
khalasar to see.

101
00:08:48,527 --> 00:08:50,821
Yes, Your Grace.

102
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,032
But you are not
Dothraki.

103
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,117
No.

104
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:58,204
Well, I don't see
why it matters.

105
00:08:58,287 --> 00:08:59,789
Grey Worm
isn't interested.

106
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,250
None of the Unsullied care
what's under our clothes.

107
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,672
He was interested.

108
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:10,216
What?

109
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,720
I believe he was
interested.

110
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,683
When the slavers
castrate the boys,

111
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,309
do they take all of it?

112
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,395
All of it?

113
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,230
The--

114
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:27,233
the pillar
and the stones.

115
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,988
I don't know,
Your Grace.

116
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,740
Haven't you
ever wondered?

117
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,788
Yes, Your Grace.

118
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,932
Grey Worm:
<i>Missandei.</i>

119
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:06,897
( speaking Valyrian )

120
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,367
The lessons you give I
in common tongue...

121
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,663
these are precious to I.

122
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,625
- To me.
- To me.

123
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,669
I don't remember teaching
you the word precious.

124
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,881
Jorah the Andal,
he teaches I--

125
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:35,843
he teaches me
this word.

126
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:38,387
Do you remember the name
you were given at birth?

127
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,098
I remember nothing.

128
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,184
Only Unsullied.

129
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:45,186
When they cut you,

130
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,813
do you remember that?

131
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,026
I'm sorry.

132
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:54,153
I'm sorry they did
that to you.

133
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:57,031
Why?
Why sorry?

134
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:59,909
It's a terrible thing
to do to a boy.

135
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:07,166
If the masters
never cut me,

136
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,627
I never am Unsullied.

137
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,588
I never stand in
the Plaza of Pride

138
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:15,091
when Daenerys Stormborn
orders us

139
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,093
to kill the masters.

140
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:20,930
I never am chosen
to lead the Unsullied.

141
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,349
I never meet Missandei

142
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,810
from the island of Naath.

143
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:45,663
I am sorry I--

144
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:48,207
for today.

145
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,292
I am sorry.

146
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,468
( speaking Valyrian )

147
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,914
( horses whinny )

148
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:38,340
Kraken. Mmm.

149
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,968
Strong as long
as they're in the sea.

150
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,721
When you take them
out of the water,

151
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:44,972
no bones.

152
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:47,224
They collapse
under their proud weight

153
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,643
and slump into
a heap of nothing.

154
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,937
You'd think
they know that.

155
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,774
Unfortunately,
they're not very bright.

156
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,152
What do you tell them?

157
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:00,779
I'm Theon Greyjoy,

158
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,115
son of Balon,
heir to the Iron Islands.

159
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,327
- And what are you really?
- I'm Reek.

160
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,412
Are you sure?

161
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:12,249
You do look very much
like a lord.

162
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,836
Formidable, proud.

163
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,172
I'm Reek.

164
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:20,049
Until when?

165
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,176
Always.

166
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:24,595
- Forever.
- That's right.

167
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:27,848
Until you're rotting
in the ground.

168
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:34,563
Remember what you are
and what you're not.

169
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,941
Bring me Moat Cailin.

170
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,035
( cawing )

171
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:09,014
No closer.

172
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,894
Who are you?

173
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,742
( grunts )

174
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:35,207
<i>( men coughing )</i>

175
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,043
<i>( flies buzzing )</i>

176
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,351
I'm Kenning,

177
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,770
commander of
this garrison.

178
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:00,441
And you say
you're Theon Greyjoy?

179
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,776
Yes.

180
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,613
And why should
I believe that?

181
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,823
I was born on Pyke
to Balon Greyjoy.

182
00:15:07,906 --> 00:15:11,160
His third
and last living son.

183
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,953
I am your prince.

184
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,247
I swear it
by the Drowned God.

185
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,416
What is dead
may never die.

186
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:19,668
Men:
What is dead
may never die.

187
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,920
And if you were
my prince,

188
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,839
why are you marching
with a Bolton army?

189
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:26,800
Lord Bolton took me
captive after Winterfell.

190
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:29,553
He sent me to treat
with you in good faith

191
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,347
as your fellow ironborn.

192
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,223
And what does
Lord Bolton want?

193
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,270
You are fading
from sickness,

194
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,688
you are badly outnumbered,

195
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,607
and you're hundreds
of miles from the sea.

196
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,942
Lord Bolton implores you
to protect your men

197
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:47,696
and abandon this fortress
you can no longer hold.

198
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,116
Do this, and he will be
just and fair with you

199
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,244
as he has been with me.

200
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:57,956
The Boltons will give
you safe passage to
the Stony Shore.

201
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,167
He wants us
to surrender?

202
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,878
My own father,
your king,

203
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:06,298
surrendered years ago
to Robert Baratheon.

204
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,676
I watched him
bend the knee.

205
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,177
There was no shame there.

206
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,930
He fought with honor,
as did you.

207
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,600
( groans )

208
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,269
( mutters )
"No shame."
"Fought with honor."

209
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,063
I'm sorry,
I didn't hear.

210
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,110
"No shame."
"Fought with honor."

211
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:32,408
Only a whipped dog
would speak this way.

212
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,161
Or a woman.

213
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,289
Are you a woman, boy?

214
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,208
You don't know--

215
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,168
The ironborn
will not surrender.

216
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,003
( mumbling )
Reek. My name is Reek...

217
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,214
You go tell
your master that,

218
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,466
Theon Greyjoy,

219
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,552
or whoever the fuck
you are.

220
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:53,303
( quietly )
My name is Reek.

221
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,013
What in the hell
are you muttering?

222
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,890
I'm Reek.

223
00:16:58,308 --> 00:16:59,768
Reek.

224
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,444
If we yield, we live?

225
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,446
Is that what it says
on this paper here?

226
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:14,908
Yes. Have your men
raise the white flag
and open the gates.

227
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,244
You're going home.

228
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:26,462
Ramsay:
<i>You didn't really think</i>
<i>I'd let them go, did you?</i>

229
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:30,132
It's fallen out
of fashion, flaying.

230
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,509
Sad, but true.

231
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,303
Traditions
are important.

232
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,930
Where are we
without our history?

233
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:39,266
- Eh?
- Yes, my lord.

234
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:41,977
Will we go home now?

235
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,022
I believe we will.

236
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:47,149
To our new home.

237
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:00,162
Royce:
<i>You have foreign blood,</i>
<i>don't you, Baelish?</i>

238
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:03,832
A great-grandfather
from Braavos, yes.

239
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,627
I suppose
all of our ancestors

240
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,545
came from somewhere
else originally.

241
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,631
Royce:
<i>Our forebearers</i>
<i>settled the Vale</i>

242
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:12,132
<i>thousands of years ago.</i>

243
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,259
<i>We've fought off invaders</i>
<i>ever since.</i>

244
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,011
The beauty of the Vale
is matched only

245
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,639
by the nobility
of its great families.

246
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,682
Lady Arryn often told me

247
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,310
that you were her rock,
Lord Royce.

248
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:26,188
She told me nothing
about you, Baelish.

249
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:29,024
But I didn't need
to hear from her.

250
00:18:29,107 --> 00:18:30,818
Moneylender.
Whoremonger.

251
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:34,071
You've been licking Tywin
Lannister's boots so long,

252
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:35,864
- it's a wonder
your tongue's not black.
- My lord--

253
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:40,035
And when Jon Arryn
named you Master of Coin,
no one cared.

254
00:18:40,118 --> 00:18:41,870
Always been a grubby job.

255
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,622
Why not let
a grubby man do it?

256
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:46,834
<i>But when I heard</i>
<i>you were lurking here,</i>

257
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,544
fawning over
the Lady Arryn--

258
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,671
Lady Arryn
invited me.

259
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:53,340
She and I have been
close since childhood.

260
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:55,926
Yes, we all know
how close you were.

261
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,595
<i>Lady Arryn's predilections</i>
<i>were her own affair.</i>

262
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,597
Her death is our affair.

263
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:03,392
Of course.
Her suicide
shattered us all.

264
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,686
She was an odd fish.

265
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:08,689
Everyone knew that.
But suicide?

266
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:11,859
<i>She adored</i>
<i>that boy of hers.</i>

267
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,528
I don't see her
abandoning him.
Not by choice.

268
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:17,489
Royce:
<i>Strange that within days</i>
<i>of your arrival,</i>

269
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:21,618
you've married Lady Arryn
and she's fallen through
the Moon Door.

270
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:24,037
She was always prone
to melancholy.

271
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:27,624
My lady wasn't meant
for a world as brutal
as ours.

272
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,877
We were told
there was a witness.
A girl.

273
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,170
A niece of yours,
I believe.

274
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:36,508
A girl with no learning
and scattered wits.

275
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:37,968
I assure you,
she would be of no help.

276
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:40,095
We'd like
to speak with her.

277
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:44,641
- Let me fetch her.
- Anya:<i> No need.</i>

278
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:48,770
We prefer to hear her
testimony unadulterated.

279
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,572
<i>( door closes )</i>

280
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,365
<i>Come closer, child.</i>

281
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,410
You have nothing
to fear from us or him.

282
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:08,290
<i>Lord Baelish here</i>
<i>is your uncle?</i>

283
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:11,126
<i>Your name is Alayne?</i>

284
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:14,254
<i>Perhaps you would feel</i>
<i>more comfortable if Lord</i>
<i>Baelish left the room.</i>

285
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,757
- My lady--
- I wasn't asking you.

286
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,760
- He can stay.
- Speak up, girl, you're not
a damn kitchen mouse.

287
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:21,803
Tell us what you saw.

288
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,225
I'm sorry, Lord Baelish.

289
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,102
I have to tell the truth.

290
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:36,026
I'll tell you
everything.

291
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:40,530
Please, Alayne,
leave nothing out.

292
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,743
My name is not Alayne.

293
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:46,578
It's Sansa Stark,

294
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,581
eldest daughter
of Lord Eddard Stark.

295
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,167
Lord Royce, we met when
you came to Winterfell.

296
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,253
You were escorting your son
Ser Waymar to the Wall.

297
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:58,674
Sansa Stark?

298
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:02,010
You tell lies
right to my face,
you little worm?

299
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:05,180
Lord Baelish
has told many lies.

300
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,894
All to protect me.

301
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,105
<i>Since my father</i>
<i>was executed,</i>

302
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:16,233
I have been a hostage
in King's Landing.

303
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:18,902
A plaything for Joffrey
to torture

304
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,654
or Queen Cersei
to torment.

305
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:23,782
They beat me,
they humiliated me,

306
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:26,660
they married me
to the Imp.

307
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:29,788
I had no friends
in King's Landing...

308
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,458
except one.

309
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:41,675
He saved me.

310
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:45,137
Smuggled me away
when he had the chance.

311
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:49,057
He knew I'd be safe
here in the Eyrie

312
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:53,353
with my own blood,
my Aunt Lysa.

313
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:56,356
The Lannisters have
friends everywhere.

314
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,025
<i>Even the Vale.</i>

315
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:00,777
<i>He made me swear</i>
<i>not to tell anyone</i>
<i>my true name.</i>

316
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:03,030
Your secret is safe
with us, my lady.

317
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:06,199
Royce:
<i>Your father grew up</i>
<i>right here in these halls.</i>

318
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:08,452
We hunted together
many times.

319
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:10,037
He was a fine man.

320
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:14,791
Tell us what happened
to your aunt, Sansa.

321
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,755
You knew her well,
my lords, my lady.

322
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:22,174
You knew she was
a troubled woman.

323
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:24,885
She always loved
Lord Baelish.

324
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:26,720
She told me herself.

325
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:29,181
From the moment he arrived
at the gates of Riverrun,

326
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:33,977
a boy of eight carrying
everything he owned
in a little sack.

327
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:38,231
<i>She confessed to me</i>
<i>she never loved Lord Arryn.</i>

328
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:41,818
She did as her
father commanded,
as so many of us have.

329
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:46,114
<i>When the gods finally allowed</i>
<i>her to be with Lord Baelish,</i>

330
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,908
she was so happy.

331
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:50,243
For a time.

332
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:54,164
My aunt
was a jealous lady.

333
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:58,043
She was terrified
that Lord Baelish

334
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,461
didn't love her
anymore.

335
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:02,380
That he would abandon
her for a younger woman.

336
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,594
And then...

337
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:10,972
one day she saw
him kiss me.

338
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,891
Lady Sansa.

339
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:15,727
It was a peck on the cheek,
Lord Royce, nothing more.

340
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:19,606
Lord Baelish
is my uncle now,
in truth, by marriage.

341
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:22,901
He's always been
so kind to me.

342
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:25,278
I was so happy to be here,
to be free.

343
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,364
All because of him.

344
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:29,699
But my aunt
turned on me.

345
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:32,744
She cursed me.
Called me a whore.

346
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,956
Promised to throw me
through the Moon Door.

347
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:38,291
When Lord Baelish tried
to calm her,

348
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,293
she struck him.

349
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:41,962
She said she didn't want
to live anymore.

350
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:43,964
<i>She stood on the edge</i>
<i>of that Moon Door.</i>

351
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:45,715
He tried
to reason with her.

352
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:48,260
Promised her
she was the only one
he had ever loved,

353
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:53,014
but she stepped through
those doors and she was--

354
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:57,686
Shh.

355
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:01,314
Shh, it's not your fault,
sweet girl.

356
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,989
It's not
your fault.

357
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:26,298
You could see
it in the way she
raised that boy.

358
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:29,467
Feeding him from
her own teats when he
was 10 years old.

359
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:32,554
Lord Royce!
This is hardly the time.

360
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:34,598
Apologies, my lady.

361
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,141
And to you
as well, Baelish.

362
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:38,018
We treated you
a bit harshly.

363
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:39,853
You want justice,
Lord Royce.

364
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,354
I can hardly
complain about that.

365
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:43,064
I want the same.

366
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:47,694
Not much justice to be meted
out in suicide, is there?

367
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:50,280
For Lysa, no.
But for her son?

368
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:52,282
Only 20 years ago,
the knights of the Vale

369
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:55,744
rode behind Jon Arryn,
Ned Stark, Robert Baratheon.

370
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:59,539
They fought together
to overcome the Mad King.

371
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,333
And since then,
Arryn and Royce,

372
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:03,084
Corbray, Waynwood,

373
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:06,254
all the great houses
of the Vale watched
from the corner.

374
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,089
A timid boy
at a tavern brawl.

375
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,675
Are you questioning
our courage?

376
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,553
I want to know
which side you're on.

377
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,096
Do you support
the Lannisters,

378
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,848
the house that executed
your friend Ned Stark?

379
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:19,392
Of course we don't
support the damn
Lannisters.

380
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:23,438
No? Catelyn Stark begged
her sister for support
and Lysa refused.

381
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:26,399
By staying out of the fray,
you've allowed Tywin Lannister

382
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:29,110
to destroy his rivals
on every compass point.

383
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,570
Who stands
against him now?

384
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:33,156
Who would you have
us back, Lord Baelish?

385
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,075
Robb Stark is dead.

386
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:37,744
I'd have you back
Robin Arryn,

387
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:39,663
Lord of the Vale.

388
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:41,373
Robin Arryn is
a sickly little boy.

389
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:44,834
And sickly little boys
sometimes become powerful men.

390
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,753
More often
they die young.

391
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:49,422
I adored Lysa
with all my heart.

392
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:53,593
But she loved her son
so much, she became
overprotective.

393
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:56,054
He needs to learn
how to swing a sword.

394
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:57,555
How to ride a horse.

395
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:00,433
- Aye, it's time.
- Yes, it's time.

396
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,435
Time for him
to tour the Vale,

397
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:05,021
to visit all the castles
in his domain.

398
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:08,400
Time for Robin
to leave the nest.

399
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,411
( grunts )

400
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,171
Boy:
<i>Ser Barristan.</i>

401
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,007
Yes?

402
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:35,051
Who sent you?

403
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,922
- Ser Barristan.
- Ser Jorah.

404
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,925
Have I forgotten
a council meeting?

405
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,094
No.

406
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:28,646
What's this?

407
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,190
A royal pardon

408
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:32,817
signed by
Robert Baratheon.

409
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:48,500
You spied on her.

410
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,212
Who gave you this?

411
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:54,798
Does it matter?

412
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,557
Have you told her?

413
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:07,102
I wanted
to tell you first,
man-to-man

414
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:10,146
rather than go
behind your back.

415
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,402
Let me speak
with her in private.

416
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,987
You'll never be alone
with her again.

417
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:56,943
Why did the usurper
pardon you?

418
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,614
If we could
speak alone.

419
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:04,075
No, speak to me here.

420
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,910
Explain it to me.

421
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:08,872
Who do you think
sent this to Meereen?

422
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:10,540
Who profits?

423
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:12,959
This is the work
of Tywin Lannister.

424
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:14,794
He wants to divide us.

425
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:17,464
If we're fighting
each other, we're not
fighting him.

426
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:20,383
The pardon was signed
the year we met.

427
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:23,595
Why were you pardoned?

428
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:26,055
Unless you're saying
this document was forged.

429
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:30,560
It is not forged.

430
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:32,520
Why, then?

431
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,230
I sent letters to Varys,

432
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:36,608
the spymaster
of King's Landing.

433
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:38,902
What was the content
of these letters?

434
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:41,404
- Information.
- What information?

435
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:44,699
When you and Viserys
arrived in Pentos.

436
00:29:44,782 --> 00:29:46,993
His plan to marry you
to Khal Drogo.

437
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:49,204
<i>When you were married.</i>

438
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,997
When your brother died.

439
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,500
You told him I was
carrying Drogo's child?

440
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,168
- I--
- Yes or no?

441
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:56,753
- Khaleesi.
-<i> Don't call me that.</i>

442
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:59,881
Did you tell him I was
carrying Drogo's child?

443
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:04,052
Yes.

444
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:08,431
That wine merchant
tried to poison me

445
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:10,350
because of
your information.

446
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:12,143
I stopped you
from drinking his wine.

447
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,354
Because you knew
it was poisoned.

448
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:16,523
I suspected.

449
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:19,192
You betrayed me

450
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:21,277
from the first.

451
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:24,197
Forgive me.

452
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,366
I never meant--

453
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:28,618
please, Khaleesi,
forgive me.

454
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:31,246
You sold my secrets to
the man who killed my father

455
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,540
- and stole
my brother's throne...
- I have protected you.

456
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:34,916
Fought for you.
Killed for you.

457
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,459
...and you want me
to forgive you?

458
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:40,505
I have loved you.

459
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:42,382
Love?

460
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:45,260
Love? How can you
say that to me?

461
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:48,221
<i>Any other man,</i>
<i>and I would have</i>
<i>you executed.</i>

462
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:51,474
But you, I do not
want you in my city
dead or alive.

463
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:54,894
Go back to your masters
in King's Landing.

464
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:57,564
Collect your pardon
if you can.

465
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:01,818
Daenerys, please.

466
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:05,738
Don't ever presume
to touch me again

467
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,115
or speak my name.

468
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,075
You have until dusk
to collect your things

469
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:10,618
and leave this city.

470
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,413
<i>If you're found in Meereen</i>
<i>past break of day,</i>

471
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:16,124
I'll have your head
thrown into Slaver's Bay.

472
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,295
Go.

473
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,881
Now.

474
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:37,186
<i>( footsteps departing )</i>

475
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:21,731
Moat Cailin
is yours, Father.

476
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,657
Walk with me.

477
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,367
Has there been
any word from Locke?

478
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,494
No.

479
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:35,912
Unimportant.

480
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:38,206
A cripple,
a young boy.

481
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:41,042
None of the northern
lords have seen them.

482
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:44,003
Dead most likely.

483
00:32:45,963 --> 00:32:48,716
Most of the ironborn
have fled the North.

484
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,929
Now more will follow,
thanks to you.

485
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,392
Tell me what you see.

486
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:04,399
Moors, fields, hills.

487
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:07,402
Tell me what you see.

488
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,866
Nothing.

489
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,284
Not nothing.

490
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:17,537
The North.

491
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,707
Ride 700 miles that way,
you're still in the North.

492
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:23,459
400 miles that way.

493
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:25,420
300 miles that way.

494
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:29,465
The North is larger
than the other six
kingdoms combined.

495
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,217
And I am the Warden
of the North.

496
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,928
The North is mine.

497
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:38,182
Now tell me,
what is your name?

498
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:44,063
Ramsay Snow.

499
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,274
No, not Ramsay Snow.

500
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:49,777
Open it.

501
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:52,405
From this day
until your last day,

502
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:54,073
you are Ramsay Bolton,

503
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:57,118
son of Roose Bolton,
Warden of the North.

504
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:05,793
You honor me.

505
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,421
I swear I will
uphold your name

506
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:10,631
and your tradition.

507
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:13,092
I will be worthy
of you, Father,

508
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:15,386
I promise.

509
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:37,492
Come, Reek,
I'll be needing
a bath.

510
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,187
<i>( knocks )</i>

511
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,105
Yes?

512
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:13,694
<i>( door closes )</i>

513
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:23,663
<i>First time I saw you,</i>
<i>you were just a child.</i>

514
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:27,083
<i>A girl from the North</i>
<i>come to the capital</i>
<i>for the first time.</i>

515
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:29,961
Not a child any longer.

516
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:35,633
Why did you help me?

517
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,760
They would have thrown you
through the Moon Door

518
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,428
if they found
you guilty.

519
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:42,139
<i>That's not an answer.</i>

520
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:46,769
If they'd have
executed you,

521
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:49,146
what would they
have done with me?

522
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,732
I don't know.

523
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:55,361
Neither do I.

524
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:57,363
Better to gamble
on the man you know

525
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:59,198
than the strangers
you don't?

526
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,244
And you think
you know me?

527
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,706
I know what you want.

528
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:08,749
<i>Do you?</i>

529
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:25,683
Arya: I thought
it'd make me happy,

530
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:27,685
but it doesn't.
Not really.

531
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:29,687
Hound:
Nothing makes
you happy.

532
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,230
- Lots of things
make me happy.
- Like what?

533
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,190
Killing Polliver,
killing Rorge.

534
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:36,652
So you're sad because
you didn't get to kill
Joffrey yourself.

535
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,070
Is that it?

536
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:40,072
At least I could
have been there to watch.

537
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,575
I wanted to see
the look in his eyes
when he knew it was over.

538
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:46,245
Aye, nothing in the world
beats that look.

539
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:48,623
You protected him
for most of his life.

540
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,207
You think you
could have saved him?

541
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:53,127
I wasn't the damn
wine taster.

542
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:59,258
Little shit deserved
to die, but poison--

543
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:02,178
poison's a woman's weapon.

544
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:03,971
Men kill with steel.

545
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,598
That's your stupid
pride talking.

546
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:07,934
It's why you'll never
be a great killer.

547
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:10,978
I'd have killed Joffrey with
a chicken bone if I had to.

548
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,438
( laughs )

549
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:15,316
I'd pay good money
to see that.

550
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:18,027
( groans )

551
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:21,113
You should have
let me burn it.

552
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:23,616
It's a fleabite.

553
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:27,119
That fleabite's got
you walking a lot slower
than you used to.

554
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:30,706
Well, we won't
have to walk
too much further.

555
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,416
You really
think my aunt
will pay for me?

556
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,043
Aye, she'll pay.

557
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:35,544
I've never even
met her.

558
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:38,965
Doesn't matter.
You're her blood.

559
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:42,927
Family, honor,
all that horseshit.

560
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:46,222
It's all you lords
and ladies ever talk about.

561
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:49,225
I'm not a lady.

562
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:51,644
Knight:
Who would pass
the Bloody Gate?

563
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:55,064
The bloody Hound,
Sandor Clegane.

564
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:57,316
And his...

565
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,403
traveling companion
Arya Stark,

566
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:03,823
<i>niece of your lady</i>
<i>Lysa Arryn.</i>

567
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:06,742
Then I offer
my condolences.

568
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:09,328
Lady Arryn died.

569
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:13,874
Three days ago.

570
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:19,297
( laughing )

571
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:27,888
( laughing continues )

572
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:33,894
I've never left home
before, Uncle Petyr.

573
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:36,063
- I'm afraid to leave.
- You shouldn't be.

574
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:39,317
The Lord of the Vale
belongs in the Eyrie,
Mother said.

575
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,861
She said it's not
safe outside.

576
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:43,612
It wasn't safe
for her inside.

577
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:47,283
People die
at their dinner tables.

578
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:49,410
They die in their beds.

579
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:53,039
They die squatting
over their chamber pots.

580
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:54,999
Everybody dies
sooner or later.

581
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:57,793
Don't worry
about your death.

582
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:00,129
Worry about your life.

583
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:02,339
Take charge of your life

584
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,759
for as long as it lasts.

585
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:08,012
That is what it means
to be Lord of the Vale.

586
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:10,765
<i>( footsteps )</i>

587
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,954
Shall we go?

588
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:43,839
Wine always helps.

589
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,760
I thank you
for it.

590
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:51,138
Trial by combat.

591
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:54,058
Deciding a man's guilt
or innocence

592
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,603
in the eyes of the gods

593
00:39:57,686 --> 00:40:00,648
by having two other men
hack each other to pieces.

594
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:03,275
Tells you something
about the gods.

595
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:07,446
How much longer?

596
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,865
Soon.

597
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,829
Do you think
Oberyn has a chance?

598
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:19,667
The Red Viper of Dorne.

599
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:22,044
You don't get a name
like that unless you're
deadly, right?

600
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:23,629
<i>I've never</i>
<i>seen him fight.</i>

601
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:26,298
Oh, he's going to die.
I'm going to die.

602
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:27,883
Oberyn believes in himself.

603
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:30,719
That's putting it mildly.

604
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,888
What's the punishment
for regicide?

605
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:35,683
Drawing and quartering?
Hanging?

606
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:38,144
-<i> Breaking at the wheel?</i>
<i>- Beheading.</i>

607
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:39,812
<i>Seems rather</i>
<i>ordinary.</i>

608
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:42,356
<i>And he was my nephew</i>
<i>as well, so what is that?</i>

609
00:40:42,439 --> 00:40:44,108
Fratricide is brothers.

610
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:46,193
Filicide is sons.

611
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:49,780
Nepoticide.
That's the one.

612
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:54,952
Matricide, patricide,

613
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:59,081
infanticide, suicide.

614
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:01,876
There's no kind of
killing that doesn't
have its own word.

615
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,502
Cousins.

616
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,713
<i>Cousins, you're right.</i>

617
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:07,506
There is no word
for cousin killing.

618
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,508
Well done.

619
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:12,553
Do you remember
cousin Orson?
Orson Lannister?

620
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,763
Of course.
Wet-nurse dropped
him on his head.

621
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:17,391
- Left him simple.
-<i> Simple?</i>

622
00:41:17,474 --> 00:41:19,101
Used to sit all day
in the garden.

623
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:21,353
Crushing beetles
with a rock.

624
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:23,397
( both grunting )

625
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:27,026
( chuckles )
Nothing made him happier.

626
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:28,569
Nothing made you happier.

627
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:30,321
You'd think being
tormented from birth

628
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:32,489
would have given you some
affinity for the afflicted.

629
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:35,618
On the contrary.
Laughing at another
person's misery

630
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:37,828
was the only thing
that made me feel
like everyone else.

631
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:39,622
The joke wore thin, though.

632
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:41,832
<i>For you.</i>
<i>You drifted away.</i>

633
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,375
I had other interests.

634
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:45,544
Yes, other interests.

635
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:49,381
But I stayed with Orson.

636
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,300
<i>Why?</i>

637
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:52,843
I was curious.

638
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:55,012
Why was he smashing
all those beetles?

639
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:56,430
What did he
get out of it?

640
00:41:56,513 --> 00:41:58,933
<i>First thing I did</i>
<i>was ask him.</i>

641
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:02,728
"Orson,
why are you smashing
all those beetles?"

642
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:05,814
He gave me an answer.
"Smash the beetles.

643
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:08,776
Smash 'em."
( grunting )

644
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:11,320
<i>I wasn't deterred.</i>

645
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:13,197
I was the smartest
person I knew.

646
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,824
Certainly I had
the wherewithal to
unravel the mysteries

647
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:17,743
that lay at the heart
of a moron.

648
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:21,038
So I went to
Maester Volarik's library.

649
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:23,082
Volarik.
Tried to touch me once.

650
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:25,584
Turns out,
far too much has been
written about great men

651
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:28,170
and not nearly enough
about morons.

652
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:30,256
Doesn't seem right.

653
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:32,258
In any case,
I found nothing

654
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:34,385
that illuminated the nature
of Orson's affliction

655
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:37,304
or the reason behind his
relentless beetle slaughter.

656
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,765
<i>So I went back</i>
<i>to the source.</i>

657
00:42:39,848 --> 00:42:41,850
<i>I may not have been able</i>
<i>to speak with Orson,</i>

658
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:44,395
but I could observe him,
watch him

659
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:46,647
the way men
watch animals

660
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:49,900
to come to
a deeper understanding
of their behavior.

661
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:53,862
And as I watched,

662
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:56,615
I became more and more
sure of it.

663
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:59,118
There was something
happening there.

664
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:02,288
His face was like
the page of a book

665
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:04,123
written in a language
I didn't understand.

666
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:07,126
But he wasn't mindless.
He had his reasons.

667
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:10,421
<i>And I became possessed</i>
<i>with knowing what they were.</i>

668
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:14,049
I began to spend inordinate
amounts of time watching him.

669
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:16,719
I would eat my lunch
in the garden,

670
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:18,971
chewing my mutton
to the music of...

671
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:20,806
( grunting )

672
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:23,642
And when I wasn't
watching him, I was
thinking about him.

673
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:26,145
Father droned on about
the family legacy

674
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:27,980
<i>and I thought about</i>
<i>Orson's beetles.</i>

675
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:30,983
I read the histories
of Targaryen conquests.

676
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:33,235
Did I hear dragon wings?
No.

677
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:36,071
I heard...
( grunting )

678
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:39,992
<i>And I still couldn't figure</i>
<i>out why he was doing it.</i>

679
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:42,369
And I had to know,
because it was horrible

680
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:45,497
that all these
beetles should be dying
for no reason.

681
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:47,124
Every day around the world,

682
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:50,836
men, women, and children
are murdered by the score.

683
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:53,505
Who gives a dusty fuck
about a bunch of beetles?

684
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:56,342
I know, I know.
But still, it filled
me with dread.

685
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:59,845
Piles and piles of them,
years and years of them.

686
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:01,764
How many countless living
crawling things

687
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:04,850
smashed and dried out
and returned to the dirt?

688
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:07,186
In my dreams I found myself

689
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:09,646
standing on a beach
made of beetle husks

690
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,940
stretching as far
as the eye could see.

691
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:14,026
I woke up crying,

692
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:16,278
weeping for their
shattered little bodies.

693
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:18,781
I tried to stop
Orson once.

694
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:20,157
He was twice your size.

695
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,076
He just pushed me
aside with a "kuuh"

696
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:24,453
and kept on smashing.

697
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:27,081
Every day until
that mule

698
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:29,083
kicked him in the chest
and killed him.

699
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:42,971
So what do you think?

700
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:45,140
Why did he do it?

701
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:47,601
What was it all about?

702
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:53,065
I don't know.

707
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:48,120
Looks like
very light armor.

708
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:49,371
I like to move around.

709
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:51,206
You could at least
wear a helmet.

710
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:54,918
You shouldn't drink
before a fight.

711
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:57,296
You learn this
during your years
in the fighting pits?

712
00:45:57,379 --> 00:45:59,548
I always drink
before a fight.

713
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:02,217
It could get you killed.
It could get me killed.

714
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:05,179
Today is not
the day I die.

716

You're going
to fight that?

717
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:16,607
I'm going
to kill that.

718
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:22,738
He is the biggest man
I've ever seen.

719
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:25,574
Size does not matter
when you are flat
on your back.

720
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:26,992
Thank the gods.

we gather to ascertain

724
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:38,962

Don't leave me

731

Never.

Have they told you
who I am?

734

Some dead man.

735
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:37,604
I am the brother
of Elia Martell.

736
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:40,899
Do you know why I have come
all the way to this stinking

shit-pile of a city?

738
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:44,987
For you.

739
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:52,494
I'm going to hear you
confess before you die.

740
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:54,413
You raped my sister.

741
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:55,998
You murdered her.

742
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:57,708
You killed her children.

743
00:47:57,791 --> 00:48:00,335
Say it now and we can

No, no, no.

You haven't confessed.
