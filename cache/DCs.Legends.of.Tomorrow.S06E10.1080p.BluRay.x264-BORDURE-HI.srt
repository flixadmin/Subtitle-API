00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:14,641
[Crowley] Is this your plan, old boy?

2
00:00:14,974 --> 00:00:17,602
Force me to watch you
smack your lips together

3
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:19,729
like some sort of blond ape

4
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:23,441
until I tell you where I stashed
the map to the Fountain of Imperium?

5
00:00:25,235 --> 00:00:28,363
It won't work.
I offered to be your partner once

6
00:00:28,613 --> 00:00:31,824
and you locked me
in a ruddy chest with that witch.

7
00:00:31,908 --> 00:00:33,284
That's right.

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,328
Mmm...

9
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:43,836
Ugh! You filthy, uncouth scoundrel!

10
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,340
Now you're gonna tell me
where the map is,

11
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:51,761
or I'm gonna desecrate your painting
with my bodily fluids.

12
00:00:52,387 --> 00:00:55,390
- Just get this lump off my face!
- Okay.

13
00:00:55,974 --> 00:00:58,643
I entrusted the map to a banker,

14
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:02,397
to hold on to
until my eventual resurrection.

15
00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:04,691
All right then, partner.

16
00:01:05,316 --> 00:01:07,569
[smacks lips]
What's this banker's name, eh?

Constantine.

20
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:18,705
Aren't you going to invite me in?

21
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:21,666
You're a vampire.

22
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:26,337
It's best you come in then.

23
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:32,051
Where is Aleister?

24
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,097
Don't worry about him.
From now on, you'll deal with me.

25
00:01:36,222 --> 00:01:37,599
You have my two million pounds.

26
00:01:38,391 --> 00:01:39,517
Two million quid?

27
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:41,184
[scoffs] Bloody hell.

28
00:01:41,311 --> 00:01:43,479
How much interest
have you been charging, Vampy?

29
00:01:43,563 --> 00:01:44,564
[hissing]

30
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:47,025
All right, calm down.

31
00:01:47,108 --> 00:01:48,693
Don't get your knickers all in a knot.

32
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:53,906
See, I'm offering something
far more valuable than dosh, love.

33
00:01:55,867 --> 00:01:56,909
A favor.

34
00:02:00,246 --> 00:02:02,040
What could you possibly do for me?

35
00:02:02,457 --> 00:02:05,043
Spare your immortal life, for one.

36
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:11,424
One word and sunshine
will turn you to ashes.

37
00:02:15,678 --> 00:02:16,679
Clever.

38
00:02:16,763 --> 00:02:19,015
Mmm. I'm John Constantine, love.

39
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,767
Clever doesn't even
begin to describe me.

40
00:02:20,892 --> 00:02:22,769
Now hand over
what you were holding for Crowley

41
00:02:22,852 --> 00:02:24,896
and you can be on your merry little way.

42
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:39,869
Go on, set it on the table.

43
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:46,751
Now that you've invited me in, <i>mon cher,</i>

44
00:02:47,627 --> 00:02:51,339
I can come back any time I want.

[chuckles]

46
00:02:53,466 --> 00:02:55,259
I have magical rooms powerful enough

47
00:02:55,343 --> 00:02:58,388
to keep out worse
than the likes of you, sweetheart.

48
00:03:04,686 --> 00:03:06,229
Aleister's as well.

49
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:09,899
A little potion I procured for him.

50
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:14,237
One day, you might get a taste for it.

51
00:03:15,154 --> 00:03:19,909
One day, you might be
positively gagging for the stuff.

52
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:30,712
[door closes]

53

A superhero, a totem bearer
and an alien named Gary

become singing mannies.

Did I just invent our spin-off?

Are you recording because Sara
and Ava asked for constant updates?

[Zari clears throat]

They don't think we can survive
one weekend without them, do they?

71
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:52,251
Listen, I just want them to look
for their wedding venue

72
00:04:52,335 --> 00:04:54,420
without dealing with these dummies.

No more singing.
I can't take it anymore.

00:05:05,932 --> 00:05:08,059
That little snot's not crying
because it's tired.

77
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:10,061
It's got growing pains.

[growls]

Uh, what does that mean?

00:05:20,238 --> 00:05:22,323
Yeah, I can see
where this is going, New Zari.

83
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:24,492
Well, technically,
I'm the original Zari.

84
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:25,576
The OZ.

85
00:05:25,743 --> 00:05:26,786
The one and only.

86
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:32,583
Yeah, I'm not translating for Gary
just because he lost his glasses.

87
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:36,337
And I'm definitely not helping y'all
parse Gus's every gurgle.

88
00:05:36,462 --> 00:05:38,756
If I wanted to take care of a baby,

89
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,134
I would have stayed in Texas
and married the first jerk I kissed.

90
00:05:43,094 --> 00:05:45,555
Yeah, she's really got
that new-girl-on-the-ship vibes.

91
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:51,602
Leeching human souls
wasn't quite enough for you,

92
00:05:51,686 --> 00:05:54,105
was it, Master Crowley?
No, no, no, no.

93
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:57,775
- You were juicing.
- What a crass term.

94
00:05:57,859 --> 00:06:01,153
I was reaching for new mystical heights,

95
00:06:01,237 --> 00:06:03,865
aided by a rare cocktail of blood.

96
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:05,908
You absolute tosspot.

00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:08,369
You know as well as I do
that magic this powerful,

98
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:10,079
it comes at a terrible, terrible price.

99
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:12,748
It's because of that potion
that you have the map.

100
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:17,503
In 1939, I took a rather large dose
and fell into a trance

101
00:06:17,587 --> 00:06:20,882
where an extraterrestrial
dictated the map to me.

102
00:06:20,965 --> 00:06:22,174
Pity he didn't speak English.

103
00:06:22,258 --> 00:06:24,051
I might have discovered
where in the heavens

104
00:06:24,302 --> 00:06:27,013
- the Fountain was hidden.
- Yes, the heavens.

105
00:06:27,138 --> 00:06:28,848
You see, that's where
you were going wrong.

106
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:31,267
My alien mate, Gary,

107
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,270
he reckons
that the Fountain of Imperium

108
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:37,815
is somewhere here on Earth,
lost to history.

109
00:06:39,025 --> 00:06:42,486
And this cut-out is the key.

110
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:44,488
Let's see.

111
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:48,910
It should fit exactly... Spain.

112
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,954
That's where the Fountain was in 1939.

113
00:06:52,747 --> 00:06:55,374
Take me with you, John.
We're partners now, right?

114
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:58,669
Skip it.
I've got a new partner in mind.

115
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:02,882
You know, I have other skills
besides being an alien telepath.

116
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:05,217
Couldn't literally anyone else help you

117
00:07:05,301 --> 00:07:06,844
with Rory's brood pooch instead?

118
00:07:06,928 --> 00:07:08,471
Please? It'll just take a second.

Okay, amazing.
Um, I should warn you, though.

around the whole pregnancy thing.

Or didn't they
teach you that at college?

125
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:28,824
Dad, a-year-and-a-half ago
in my past, which is your future,

126
00:07:28,908 --> 00:07:30,159
you ceased all contact.

127
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:33,537
Okay, if you really have Kayla's eggs
in your skull,

128
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:35,706
then maybe they'll give a clue
to what will happen.

129
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:37,291
Ever seen the movie <i>Alien?</i>

130
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:39,418
Yeah, I think we know what will happen.

Spooner, please,

132
00:07:42,213 --> 00:07:43,631
just look at the protrusion.

Oh, oh, oh...

00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:07,655
What sordid scene have I interrupted?
Never mind. Don't care.

139
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:09,824
Spooner, join me for a shot
and a chinwag?

140
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:14,537
Good luck with that.

141
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:22,962
Long story short,
I have been stripped of my magic

142
00:08:23,087 --> 00:08:25,673
in service of transforming you
back from a fork, I might add.

143
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:27,717
What do you want me to translate, John?

144
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,386
A map to the Fountain of Imperium,

145
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:33,764
which, according to my research,
is a wellspring of magic

146
00:08:33,848 --> 00:08:37,977
gifted to humans by aliens long ago,
and last seen in Spain.

147

Oh. This is... This is cool.

"Only those whom are worthy
may drink from this Fountain."

149
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:48,279
It's typical prophecy malarkey.
I need a location.

150
00:08:49,155 --> 00:08:51,532
Well, this main star here is Albacete.

151
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:53,450
- Albacete?
- Mmm-hmm.

152
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:55,870
That's a city in the southeast of Spain.

153
00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:07,173
[Constantine] Well, seeing as
we're in Spain, February, 1939,

154
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:08,942
there's a few things
you ought to understand.

155
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:11,260
Now, first and foremost,
this country has just suffered

156
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:13,596
three years of a brutal
and bloody civil war.

157
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:16,348
Civil war! When were you planning
on telling me that?

158
00:09:16,432 --> 00:09:19,143
I just did.
And a class war is more like it.

159
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:21,520
You see, on one side
you have the rich and the military

160
00:09:21,604 --> 00:09:22,772
backed by Nazi Germany.

161
00:09:22,855 --> 00:09:24,899
On the other side,
you have the trade unions

162
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:27,068
and the democratically elected
government of Spain.

163
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:28,170
And don't even get me started

164
00:09:28,194 --> 00:09:30,154
on the devious little role
of the Catholic Church.

165
00:09:30,196 --> 00:09:31,447
I'm Catholic, John.

166
00:09:32,031 --> 00:09:34,511
Yeah, well, then you'll understand
my attitude towards priests.

167
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:37,244
I'd sooner rather break bread
with a bloody demon.

168
00:09:38,037 --> 00:09:40,581
Okay, well,
nothing on here says "Fountain."

169
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:43,250
- What about El Gato?
- The cat?

170
00:09:43,334 --> 00:09:45,252
No, no, no.

171
00:09:45,336 --> 00:09:46,855
It's the code name for a leftist leader

172
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:48,079
that I've heard stories about.

173
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,633
Apparently, he survived
seven assassination attempts

174
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:52,259
and one actual crucifixion.

175
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:53,719
So? Maybe he was lucky.

176
00:09:53,803 --> 00:09:56,847
Lucky? Nobody's that lucky.
That's magic.

177
00:09:56,931 --> 00:09:59,433
My guess?
El Gato drank from the Fountain.

178
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:01,310
Yeah, well, if you want to find a man,

179
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:03,437
why don't we just ask
at the local watering hole?

180
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:06,857
Hmm.

Are you taking the mickey?

00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:56,073
Do I look like a bloody fascist?

[scoffs] You look like a German.

188

- No, he doesn't.

[Constantine clears throat]

190
00:11:03,289 --> 00:11:06,792
I'll have you know that I served
with the POUM militia at Jarama.

191
00:11:07,293 --> 00:11:09,086
You were in the trenches of Jarama?

192
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:11,839
I was.

193
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:14,049
What did you grease your rifle with?

194
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:17,178
Oh, you mean the rusted antique
that they supplied me with?

195
00:11:17,303 --> 00:11:18,804
Had to grease it with olive oil.

196
00:11:19,388 --> 00:11:22,725
Water was in such short supply
that we had to shave with wine,

197
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:26,228
which is a bloody shame if you ask me
but the worst part was the lice.

198
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:30,232
- Those evil buggers, they were as...
- As big as boils.

00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:31,357
As boils, yes.

- Yeah.
- [man chuckles] Yeah.

203
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,625
Gideon said John and Spooner
took the Jumpship to Spain.

204
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,460
So I thought, theme nights.

205
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:52,421
One slice of tortilla española

Yeah. Why?

Hey, I, for one, think it's really

Hmm, wow. Real mature, Dad.

00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:15,151
So what's your plan?

213
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:16,672
Are you just gonna pretend
this isn't happening?

214

That's exactly what I'm going to do.

this ear stuff to me

Well, you didn't give Mom a warning.

Why are you still here?

00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:03,284
We heard of a man who continues
to fight the fascist bastards.

229
00:13:03,409 --> 00:13:08,372
He goes by the name of El Gato.
They say he can't be killed.

230
00:13:09,832 --> 00:13:11,083
I also have heard of this man.

231
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:13,877
El Gato. Very mysterious.

has drunk from a magical source.

What kind of source?

- he was El Gato.
- Undoubtedly.

252
00:14:16,482 --> 00:14:18,501
He probably came down from
the mountains to get some supplies.

Yeah. You clocked the old farmer?

Yeah.
Looks like he was guarding something.

00:29:28,643 --> 00:29:32,230
And I'm nothing without it, Spooner.
I'm nothing.

483
00:29:33,898 --> 00:29:35,358
[mumbles]

484
00:29:43,116 --> 00:29:44,367
[sighs]

485
00:29:45,243 --> 00:29:46,577
I can't believe I'm saying this.

486
00:29:49,205 --> 00:29:50,415
All right, John.

487
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:52,667
You win.

488
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,839
[Spooner speaking Spanish]

489
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,947
The fountain's dried up.

490
00:30:23,323 --> 00:30:24,383
[Fernando thinking in Spanish]

491
00:30:24,407 --> 00:30:26,093
[in English] He said that's where
the water came from

492
00:30:26,117 --> 00:30:27,118
that the angel gave him.

493
00:30:27,702 --> 00:30:29,620
This is just a bunch of bloody rocks.

494
00:30:29,704 --> 00:30:31,748
- Bollocks!
- Ease up, John.

495
00:30:31,873 --> 00:30:33,583
All right, all right, just...

496
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:35,209
Just give me a second, all right?

497
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:38,463
[Constantine sighs]

498
00:30:41,549 --> 00:30:42,759
All right.

499
00:30:43,217 --> 00:30:44,844
Now, here's what we do.

500
00:30:44,927 --> 00:30:46,739
Now, I told the Captain
that I was forging a connection

501
00:30:46,763 --> 00:30:47,679
between the two of you.

502
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,808
Now that connection is very,
very real.

503
00:30:49,891 --> 00:30:53,227
Now, you can use it
to push Fernando's magic into me.

504
00:30:53,311 --> 00:30:54,663
All you need is a clear intention.

505
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:57,106
Okay, wait. So you want me
to help steal Fernando's magic?

506
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,106
What happens to him?

507
00:30:58,107 --> 00:31:01,319
No... This is a way
to protect Fernando, yeah?

508
00:31:01,402 --> 00:31:02,570
It'll give him a normal life,

509
00:31:02,653 --> 00:31:05,948
away from all the Nazis chasing him
and the alien powers.

510
00:31:06,032 --> 00:31:08,785
Don't pretend for an instant
you care about Fernando.

511
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,160
<i>Vete al diablo.</i>

512
00:31:10,203 --> 00:31:14,248
All right, okay, yes,
I am the wankiest of all wankers,

513
00:31:14,332 --> 00:31:15,934
but do me a favor
while I go and check to see

514
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:18,294
that no one has followed us,
you talk to Fernando.

515
00:31:18,378 --> 00:31:20,254
He can give his magic to me
or he can keep it.

516
00:31:20,338 --> 00:31:21,881
Now, that's his choice, innit?

517
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:36,938
<i>Hombres, mas rápido.</i>

518

<i>- [Spooner] ¿Estás seguro?
- [Fernando] Sí. Sí.</i>

521
00:31:46,989 --> 00:31:48,491
- [in English] Anyone?
- No, No.

522
00:31:49,158 --> 00:31:50,158
All clear.

523
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,120
Fernando wants to make a deal.

524
00:31:52,995 --> 00:31:54,831
Smart play, kid. What's your price?

525
00:31:54,914 --> 00:31:57,708
He gives you his powers,
you use them to help find his mom.

526
00:31:58,292 --> 00:32:00,128
She was supposed to return
to the tavern.

527
00:32:00,211 --> 00:32:01,980
I told him she's probably
not gonna come back,

528
00:32:02,004 --> 00:32:03,190
but he doesn't want to believe me.

529
00:32:03,214 --> 00:32:04,424
- Done.
- [Spooner] Okay...

530
00:32:04,507 --> 00:32:05,987
John, I hope
you thought this through.

531
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:08,886
Look, he's made his choice.
Sit down, yeah? Good boy.

532
00:32:09,053 --> 00:32:10,053
Right, what do I do?

533
00:32:10,096 --> 00:32:14,225
Now all you need to do is focus
your alien connection on the boy,

534
00:32:14,308 --> 00:32:16,477
and you focus quickly, yeah?

535
00:32:16,561 --> 00:32:17,645
Yeah. I'm no wizard, John.

536
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:20,398
Oh, aren't you? So I haven't seen you
stop a giant sand worm

537
00:32:20,481 --> 00:32:22,775
- with your mind, have I? Exactly.
- Mmm.

538

[grunts]

539
00:32:31,701 --> 00:32:32,743
I can't.

540
00:32:34,454 --> 00:32:35,454
Look...

541
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:39,417
magic, you know,
is all about connection.

542
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,252
All right?
Now I use words to focus my mind.

543
00:32:41,335 --> 00:32:42,503
You know any quotes?

544
00:32:42,587 --> 00:32:44,189
I mean, there's a stupid song
stuck in my head.

545
00:32:44,213 --> 00:32:46,024
Yeah, that will do.
It's not about the words per se.

546
00:32:46,048 --> 00:32:47,248
It's more about the intention.

547
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,635
Now, remember,
you're giving this kid an opportunity

548
00:32:49,719 --> 00:32:52,722
that you never had,
the chance at a normal life.

549
00:32:53,306 --> 00:32:55,016
All right, you can do this.

Yeah, it's just a nifty little trick

Spain is not gonna be safe
for Fernando, not for a long time.

And I was just as ineffectual

Yeah, I did.

Okay, you know,
for someone who hates church,

631
00:39:03,592 --> 00:39:05,845
you sound an awful lot like a Catholic.

full of guilt and self-loathing?

00:39:38,794 --> 00:39:41,714
We were both abducted
and only I returned.

644
00:39:42,214 --> 00:39:46,760
I should have been more like Fernando
and refused to give up on her, but...

645
00:39:47,553 --> 00:39:48,804
I lost faith.

646
00:39:50,723 --> 00:39:51,724
Spoons...

647
00:39:53,392 --> 00:39:54,768
you live on a Timeship.

648
00:39:55,603 --> 00:39:57,062
It's never too late, love.

649
00:39:58,564 --> 00:40:00,107
[snoring]

650
00:40:01,984 --> 00:40:03,110
[Spooner] Listen.

651
00:40:03,277 --> 00:40:05,112
The painting of Crowley's snoring.

652
00:40:05,195 --> 00:40:07,489
- [laughs]
- Shh...

653
00:40:13,746 --> 00:40:15,831
[Spooner] Wakey, wakey, Crowley.

654
00:40:25,174 --> 00:40:26,300
John.

655
00:40:32,264 --> 00:40:34,350
To have magic back, Spooner,
is worth it.

656
00:40:35,434 --> 00:40:36,434
It's worth the risk.

657
00:40:37,811 --> 00:40:40,064
Don't do it. I'll tell Zari.

658
00:40:40,147 --> 00:40:41,190
No, you won't.

659
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:43,776
[chanting in other language]

660
00:40:46,195 --> 00:40:48,530
You'll go upstairs
and you'll sleep it off.

661
00:40:48,614 --> 00:40:50,091
Tomorrow, you'll return to the Legends.

662
00:40:50,115 --> 00:40:51,992
You'll tell them we were successful.

663
00:40:52,076 --> 00:40:53,243
You'll tell them...

664
00:40:54,995 --> 00:40:57,247
how I drank
from the Fountain of Imperium.

665
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,124
Yes, John.

666
00:41:02,044 --> 00:41:03,921
My stars.

667
00:41:04,463 --> 00:41:07,132
I take it you didn't find the Fountain.

668
00:41:07,383 --> 00:41:10,928
Are you, uh... Are you juicing, John?
[chuckles]

669
00:41:11,011 --> 00:41:13,347
- Joke's on you, dickweed.
- [door opens]

670
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:14,640
Is that so?

671
00:41:15,891 --> 00:41:17,226
<i>Bonsoir,</i> gentlemen.

672
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:19,812
You brought what I asked for?

673
00:41:27,486 --> 00:41:28,779
You can take him. He's yours.

674
00:41:28,862 --> 00:41:30,990
John, what have you done?

675
00:41:31,615 --> 00:41:33,242
No. Please, John.

676
00:41:33,742 --> 00:41:35,911
You don't know
who she'll trade my soul to.

677
00:41:36,036 --> 00:41:39,164
What a lucrative trade it will be.

678
00:41:42,543 --> 00:41:44,294
Get him out of my sight, will you?

679
00:41:45,045 --> 00:41:46,045
Until next time.

680
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:47,839
[Crowley] No!

681
00:41:48,465 --> 00:41:49,883
Damn you, John.

682
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:53,762
Remember,
all your trials and tribulations,

683
00:41:54,388 --> 00:41:56,390
you only have yourself to blame.

684
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:58,058
[door slams]

685
00:42:01,478 --> 00:42:03,480
[theme music playing]
