1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,400
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,800
We got a warrant to search his office
and everything in it.

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,840
I'm just not sure there's much
more to see.

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,200
We're onto you. Dead people come here
and monsters come out.

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,680
Rule number one,
look after number one.

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,840
Don't be crazy
or you'll get yourself killed.

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,640
Nice to have someone
who cares about me. Thank you.

8
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,360
Why do they keep disappearing
down that hallway?

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,560
Oh, my...

10
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,240
Look at the man next to your father.

11
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,560
<i>Hugo Strange. The Philosopher.</i>

12
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,840
A friend. Someone he trusted.

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,920
That's not fair.

14
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,960
That's not right.

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,880
- Have you seen the news?
- Walking zombies in Gotham?

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,720
- What's new?
- Victor Fries and Theo Galavan

17
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,040
both went to Arkham as dead men.

18
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,080
- Both returned.
- I don't care.

19
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,280
So did your friend Bridgit.

20
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,480
Bridgit Pike!

21
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,600
Wait, they sent her to Arkham?

22
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,920
The only way we're gonna find out
what's really going on in there

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,280
is if we break in ourselves.

24
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,360
But I go alone.

25
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,240
- Holy cow!
- Forensic guy?

26
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,120
- Street trash girl?
- Where's Strange right now?

27
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,280
There's an elevator,
I'll tell you where it is.

28
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,840
Freeze!

29
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,520
- Bridgit?
- My name is Firefly.

30
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,920
The sooner you stop moving,
the sooner this will be over.

31
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,000
Thanks, no thanks.

32
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,760
You can't escape.

33
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,760
<i>Enjoy yourself, Firefly.</i>

34
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,080
You should feel honored.

35
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,160
You are a sacrifice
to the Goddess of Fire.

36
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,360
It's a blessing few receive.

37
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,280
Man, Bridgit,
someone sure scrambled your eggs.

38
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,200
You're late, Selina.

39
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,840
I was starting to get worried.

40
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,560
I'm not late.
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be.

41
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,880
Have you seen Selina?

42
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,400
No.

43
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,880
So you're back
to being a rich kid, huh?

44
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,840
Why does your face look like that?

45
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,960
Selina.

46
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,280
She's in trouble and it's my fault.

47
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,640
Regarding last night's
nocturnal activities,

48
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,720
suspect calling himself Azrael

49
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,240
led a one-man assault
upon Wayne Manor,

50
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:40,120
whereupon an altercation ensued
in which said suspect was

51
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,240
blown up by a person or persons
unknown.

52
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,160
So he's dead.

53
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,280
Any questions?

54
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,560
Can you confirm that the man
known as Azrael

55
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,720
was in fact disgraced Mayor Galavan?

56
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,960
Well, seeing as how the suspect
is now meat dust,

57
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,200
a positive identification
would be difficult.

58
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,080
How long are you acting captain?

59
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,560
Until, literally, the second
someone else wants the job.

60
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,120
Who killed Galavan?

61
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,320
Which time?

62
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,200
Man, give me Azrael, Galavan,
whoever the hell he was,

63
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,720
over those jackals any day.

64
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,240
You need to bring in Hugo Strange.

65
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,520
Oh, yeah, on what charge?

66
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,600
Since when do you care?

67
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,880
Since I became acting captain,

68
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,080
the GCPD and the whole damn city's
got me under a microscope.

69
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,120
Besides which, we've been down
this road.

70
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,840
Strange is smart.
He'll have covered his tracks.

71
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,240
It's pointless going into Arkham

72
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,600
unless we know
what we're looking for.

73
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,400
We can't get that unless
we go in there.

74
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,680
I hear you, brother.

75
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,160
But my hands are tied.

76
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,160
Yeah? Well, mine aren't.

77
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,280
Well, enjoy it because
that's a luxury I don't have!

78
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,560
Detective Gordon.

79
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,720
I was hoping you'd be here.

80
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,080
Bruce, you gotta stop calling me
detective.

81
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,520
What is it?

82
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,640
Selina.

83
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,240
Hugo Strange has Selina.

84
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,280
Regarding last night's
nocturnal activities,

85
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,760
suspect calling himself Azrael

86
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,440
led a one-man assault
upon Wayne Manor,

87
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,520
whereupon an altercation ensued
in which said suspect was...

88
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,720
<i>Yes.</i>

89
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,760
Strange is losing control.

90
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,440
We need to gather the court.

91
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,200
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

92
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,800
We have a heartbeat.

93
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,520
He's waking up.

94
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,080
Look at me.

95
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,680
Good morning, son.

96
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,440
You're all right. I'm here.

97
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,880
Can you tell me who you are?

98
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,440
Can you tell me your name?

99
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,920
Who am I?

100
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,320
What is my name?

101
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,800
Yeah.

102
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,760
Amazing.

103
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,760
The Octopod DNA we introduced

104
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,760
provides exactly the effect
I was looking for.

105
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,280
Rest now, son.

106
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,720
I'll return momentarily
to tell you who you are.

107
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,840
What happened to me?

108
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:06,200
That's the seventh subject you've
woken up in the past 12 hours.

109
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,920
I assume he, like the others,
has no memory of his previous life.

110
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Yes.

111
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,240
Perhaps the trauma of rebirth
is simply too much

112
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,000
for the human mind to process.

113
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,400
You're not worried.

114
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,520
Should I be?

115
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,440
Professor, our employers
are going to shut us down.

116
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,680
You must know this.

117
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,560
What I know
is what we've accomplished.

118
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,320
We've woken the dead.

119
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,160
And, yet, none have returned
with their memory intact.

120
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,920
A tedious point.

121
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,240
What's more preferable
than giving them personas

122
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,800
that we design and control?

123
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,560
An argument lost on our employers
who care about one thing

124
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,040
and one thing only.

125
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,320
You cannot order scientific
discoveries

126
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,200
the way you order a steak, Ethel.

127
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:52,120
Now let's try subject 13,
shall we?

128
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,720
How could you do this, Master Bruce?

129
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,840
I strictly forbid you from involving
that little girl, didn't I?

130
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,320
I know.

131
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,040
But Selina's always handled herself.

132
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,920
- I was sure.
- But, you were wrong, weren't you?

133
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,320
Well, it's different if you choose to
be involved in something like this

134
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,400
but you actively involved
Selina Kyle.

135
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,240
You put your own concerns
in front of that girl's safety.

136
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,680
You're bang out of order.

137
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,960
I am, I'm really disappointed
in you, Master Bruce.

138
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,280
You're sure she's still there?

139
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,200
Yes.

140
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,800
She wouldn't have missed
our meeting otherwise.

141
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,600
Strange must be holding her
prisoner in Arkham.

142
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,280
Only I doubt she's in Arkham.

143
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,680
I wager Strange has her in the secret
lab where he created Azrael.

144
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,320
But Strange runs Arkham.

145
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,880
He's seen there every day.

146
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,000
The lab must be accessed through
Arkham.

147
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,120
You're thinking it's underground.

148
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,240
It has to be.

149
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,320
There must be stairs,
an elevator, ventilation shafts.

150
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,200
I just don't know how to find them.

151
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,120
I may have a solution.

152
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,360
The technology Strange
is using to create these monsters

153
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,680
must be very advanced.

154
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,040
My guess is he's using plutonium
isotopes to mutate cell structure.

155
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,400
If so, there will be trace radiation.

156
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,200
At Wayne Enterprise, I developed
a miniature Geiger counter

157
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,360
for battlefield use.

158
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,200
Get me into Arkham and I'll find
the entrance to that lab.

159
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,880
Wayne Foundation gives the asylum
money every year.

160
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,160
I'll ask for a tour.

161
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,760
From the man that ordered
the assassination of your father?

162
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,600
He'll wanna find out what we know.

163
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And he won't see me
and Lucius as a threat.

164
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,440
No.

165
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,560
Absolutely bloody not.

166
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,480
You're not to walk straight
into a lion's den.

167
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,560
I can't even go to back you up
with a leg like this, can I?

168
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,960
Alfred, you said yourself

169
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,960
that it's my fault
what happened to Selina Kyle.

170
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,560
That means it's my responsibility
to make it right.

171
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,040
And I may not be the man you choose
as second in a street fight

172
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,600
but anything I can do
to protect Bruce, I will.

173
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,960
Still, it's half a plan, isn't it?

174
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,200
I mean, just say that Lucius
can get you in there

175
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,640
and you find the entrance
to the laboratory, then what?

176
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,840
They tell me.

177
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,400
I call Bullock, he comes busting in
with a hundred cops,

178
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,920
keeps Strange busy, I find Selina.

179
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,280
I see.

180
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,640
And how exactly do you plan
on getting in?

181
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,200
I mean, these two, possibly, but you,

182
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,000
I mean, Strange won't let you
within a bloody mile of the place.

183
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,720
If I can get you inside the gate,
can you manage the rest of the way?

184
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,920
Yeah, I think I can.

185
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,760
The cuttlefish is a fascinating
creature.

186
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,000
Able to regenerate brain cells.

187
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:32,520
Secrete toxins from its skin, and its
DNA meshes so well with human.

188
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,320
I can't wait to see it in action.

189
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,520
Oh, I want to increase voltage
to her cortex.

190
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,800
Two-hundred-percent.

191
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,200
Are you certain, sir?

192
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,480
It will be like she's being struck
by a bolt of lightning.

193
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,160
Well, how much more damage
could we possibly do.

194
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,480
She's dead.

195
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,440
I'll see you when you wake, my dear.

196
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,920
I'm so pleased you two
are getting along.

197
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:26,040
I should warn you, Mr. Nygma, Mr.
Stirk has been known to eat people.

198
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,360
But he's promised to stop that,
haven't you, Mr. Stirk?

199
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,120
You have to get me out of here!

200
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,760
Are you asking for a favor?

201
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,720
You should have considered that
before you decided to escape.

202
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,320
How are you gonna stop Jim Gordon?

203
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
What?

204
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,640
Jim Gordon and the GCPD have
been here twice in the last week.

205
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,280
It's obvious that they know.

206
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,360
Obvious they know what?

207
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,040
Do I really have to say it?

208
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,800
You're making monsters
in the basement!

209
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,560
I'm hungry!

210
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,920
Quiet, Stirk.

211
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,160
"Monsters in the basement."

212
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,680
You are insane, Mr. Nygma.

213
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,880
Obviously.

214
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,000
Jim Gordon is coming.

215
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,920
And you're gonna need all the help
that you can get.

216
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,200
So why don't you go tell Strange

217
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,520
that if he wants to stop Gordon
and the GCPD

218
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,960
then he's gonna need my help.

219
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,800
Now!

220
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,720
We have a heartbeat.

221
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,000
She's awake.

222
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,680
She's awake.

223
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,000
Quickly, go get Professor Strange.

224
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,200
Mr. Fox is pulling up, upfront.

225
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,120
I told Gordon if I don't hear
from you within an hour,

226
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,560
I'm gonna go straight to Bullock.

227
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,480
I have to do this, Alfred.

228
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,480
- I don't have a choice.
- Of course, you got a choice.

229
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,960
In the same way, I can choose
to let you go with my blessing

230
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,200
and tell you to bring that
little girl home safe

231
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,800
or I can take you right now,

232
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,160
I can stick you on an airplane and
fly you somewhere very far away.

233
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,520
- You can't.
- Don't be such a blunk,

234
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,720
of course, I can.

235
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,880
I won't.

236
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,160
You see, for the past two years,
Master Bruce,

237
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,680
all I've tried to do is protect you
and keep you safe,

238
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,440
thinking that's what your father
wanted.

239
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,680
But you're not the same boy
he left behind, are you?

240
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,400
So I have to ask myself,

241
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,000
what would Thomas Wayne do
if he were here?

242
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,520
Your father took responsibility
for his actions.

243
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,200
He fought very hard
for what he believed in.

244
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,240
And I will not stop you
from doing the same thing.

245
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,440
So...

246
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,920
off you go.

247
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,080
Gordon and Mr. Fox
will be waiting for you.

248
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,480
Welcome back to the world, my dear.

249
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,480
I imagine you're feeling
rather confused.

250
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,080
Can you tell me who you are?

251
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,280
Do you remember your name?

252
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,040
Anything?

253
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,640
You are a war goddess.

254
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Your name is Andrast...

255
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,320
No.

256
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,440
No?

257
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:14,000
My name is Fish Mooney.

258
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,480
I'm sorry.

259
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,920
Could you please repeat that?

260
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,520
I said my name is Fish Mooney, bitch.

261
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:29,000
And you better tell me
what the hell is going on.

262
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,600
<i>You're making a mistake keeping me
locked in here.</i>

263
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,000
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

264
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,880
What allowed her to come back
with her memories intact?

265
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,320
It's too soon to tell.

266
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,280
Perhaps it was the increased voltage.

267
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,160
Something unique about the cuttlefish
DNA we spliced with her own.

268
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,520
And then again, she was pulled
from that filthy river,

269
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,440
perhaps a contaminant
from the water altered the process.

270
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:08,000
Early readings have detected
abnormalities in her brain function.

271
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,200
Yes, she may reveal abilities.

272
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,280
The most important thing is
that she knows who she is.

273
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,080
Our masters will be pleased.

274
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,960
We've created the first,
true reanimant.

275
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,800
Have you made a decision
about Mr. Nygma's offer?

276
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,240
Oh, yes.
Let's let him have a go, shall we?

277
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,640
He was clever enough to find
his way to the basement.

278
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,240
And he does have a point,
he knows Jim Gordon.

279
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,960
I'll tell him.

280
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,280
Bruce Wayne is at the front gate
asking for you.

281
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,760
And he has someone
from Wayne Enterprises with him.

282
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,800
Bold move.

283
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,040
I'm more and more impressed
with this boy.

284
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,760
Shall I tell him you're not here?

285
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,600
On the contrary, I very much
want to speak with him.

286
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,400
Hugo Strange, at your service.

287
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,400
- Lucius Fox.
- Mr. Fox.

288
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,600
And of course you are...

289
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,840
Bruce Wayne.

290
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,040
I can't tell you what it means
to finally meet you.

291
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,600
Your father was very dear to me.

292
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,360
What happened to him and your mother
was indeed a great tragedy.

293
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,320
Please accept my condolences,
belated as they may be.

294
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,560
Thank you.

295
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,000
So how can I be of help?

296
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,480
It goes without saying that the work
we do here would not be possible

297
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,800
without the support
of the Wayne Foundation.

298
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,520
The asylum was a cause close
to my parents' hearts.

299
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,760
As such, I believe it is my duty to
see how their money is being spent.

300
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,720
So this is bit of an inspection.

301
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,960
Oh, nothing so formal.

302
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,080
We were just hoping
for a look around.

303
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,840
We don't normally give tours.

304
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,760
Even to someone who provides
a quarter of your operating budget?

305
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,440
Of course, we can make exceptions.

306
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,760
I'd be happy to be your guide.

307
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,640
Actually, I thought that you
and I could talk

308
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,840
while Mr. Fox looks around.

309
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,040
He's very discreet.

310
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,720
I see.

311
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,760
You've come armed with a plan.

312
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,960
I'm afraid we can't allow
civilians to wander about

313
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:37,000
but perhaps my assistant Miss Peabody
could accompany Mr. Fox.

314
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,640
That's fine. I'll just get my coat.

315
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,920
Mr. Wayne, if you will.

316
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,280
Bruce is going with Strange
to his office while I get the tour.

317
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,880
I see anything,
I'll mark it with this.

318
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,040
You're clear.

319
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,200
ARKHAM ASYLUM

320
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,720
- This is expired.
- Yeah, I lost my new one.

321
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,320
Keep meaning to have it replaced.

322
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,040
Do it today.

323
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,240
This is our rec room,

324
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,200
where our inmates work
on their socialization skills.

325
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:55,080
Who designed the uniforms?

326
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,440
Do you have much training
in mental health, Mr. Fox?

327
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,760
None, none at all.

328
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,760
- Shall we continue?
- Yes.

329
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:26,000
Bruce, as much as I value
the opportunity to finally meet you,

330
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,800
perhaps we could address
the real reason for your visit.

331
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,360
I'm not sure I know what you mean.

332
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,360
Well, you see, the other day,
James Gordon came to see me.

333
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,560
He asked about a project that your
father and I worked on a decade ago.

334
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,280
I was led to believe that
he was acting on your behalf.

335
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,200
Is that not why you're here?

336
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,800
After he left the GCPD,

337
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,680
I retained Mr. Gordon
to look into my parents' deaths.

338
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,520
He's been pursuing various leads

339
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,760
and he doesn't share
everything with me.

340
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:59,160
If he overstepped or caused some
offense, you have my apologies.

341
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,040
Thank you.

342
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,600
And I can understand
how you want answers.

343
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,800
How difficult it must be to accept
that something so horrific

344
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,840
as the murder of one's own parents

345
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,240
could be a random
and meaningless act.

346
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,880
So you want a reason.

347
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,800
Someone to blame.

348
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,560
In their case, I think
there was someone to blame.

349
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,640
Oh, so do I.

350
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,560
Sugar?

351
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,080
Arkham Asylum has been open

352
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,960
before the days of water
cures and trepanning.

353
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,640
That's boring a hole in the skull
to release bad humors.

354
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,600
We don't do that anymore.

355
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,240
What is that?

356
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:00,000
This measures air-quality.

357
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,400
Micro-particles.

358
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,880
Mr. Wayne is concerned

359
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,280
that the patients
are in a healthy environment.

360
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,600
Asthma and whatnot.

361
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,200
You're doing good so far.

362
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,960
I'm so relieved.

363
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,760
This way.

364
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,800
- Mr. Fox?
- Yep.

365
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,760
Coming.

366
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,360
You remind me of him.

367
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,440
Thomas.

368
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,760
You have that same look in your eyes.

369
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,880
What look is that?

370
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,600
Certainty.

371
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:05,000
As a scientist that's a luxury
that I cannot afford.

372
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:08,120
No, in science there must always be
some doubt but not with Thomas.

373
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,800
No. Thomas believed in things.

374
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,120
I think what you're referring
to is moral principles.

375
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,200
Yes.

376
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,920
Sadly, science and moral absolutes
do not make easy bedfellows.

377
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,120
Oh, the arguments we used to have.

378
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,640
I could never make him listen.

379
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,640
I'm glad to hear that.

380
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,520
Are you?

381
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,320
Haven't you ever imagined the life
that might have been

382
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,600
if your father hadn't been
so certain?

383
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,880
If he had listened?

384
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,680
Then he wouldn't have been
the man he was.

385
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,640
True.

386
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,560
But he wouldn't be dead either.

387
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,680
Along with your mother.

388
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,320
Are those ideals that your father
cherished so worth it?

389
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,840
Wouldn't you gladly trade everything
you believe

390
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:01,480
for one more day, one more hour
with your parents alive?

391
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,720
So you admit it then?

392
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,800
You admit what you did?

393
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,560
Here's what I admit, Bruce.

394
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,920
That I was your father's friend

395
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,080
and I pleaded with him
as I plead with you now.

396
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,280
Turn back.

397
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,080
Surely, you have those
that you care about.

398
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,720
For their sake, as well as your own.

399
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:36,600
Make the choice your father did not.

400
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,360
You have been searching
for the man who killed your parents

401
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:24,000
but the answer has always been
right in front of you.

402
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:28,440
Bruce, your father orphaned you.

403
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:33,000
His actions fired the bullet
that killed him and your mother.

404
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,560
He knew what he was doing
and he did it anyway.

405
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:41,680
I'm begging you
not to follow his path.

406
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:52,120
You want to know if I wish
my parents were alive?

407
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,720
Of course.

408
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,600
Would I give anything
to have them back?

409
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,680
Yes.

410
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:04,160
But my father fought and died
for what he believed was right.

411
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,720
And if necessary,

412
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,560
so will I.

413
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,680
Take them.

414
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,440
It seems you are your father's son.

415
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,040
I want you to know how greatly
I respect that.

416
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,880
Where's Selina Kyle?

417
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,280
What have you done with her?

418
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,240
They got you locked up good in here.

419
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,040
I'm gonna get us out of here,
Bridgit.

420
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,320
Bruce is gonna find us
and we'll get you help.

421
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,280
Lunchtime.

422
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,000
Where am I?

423
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,520
This isn't an island, is it?

424
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,400
Hey, lady, I just work here.

425
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,560
You want your lunch?

426
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,920
You wanna make yourself useful?

427
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,760
Make me a grilled cheese sandwich.

428
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,320
Someone will come looking
for the Wayne boy.

429
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,040
Yes.

430
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,480
You like him.

431
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,720
He reminds me of Thomas.

432
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,520
Whom I miss,
ironic as that might seem.

433
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,480
The boy is a threat.
You know what needs to be done.

434
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,120
You don't have much time.

435
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,280
<i>You have less than you imagine.</i>

436
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,520
Oh, no.

437
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,840
<i>We need a word, Strange.</i>

438
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,440
Of course, how might I be of service?

439
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,760
<i>First, the father, now the son.</i>

440
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,960
<i>You have a habit of catching
the eye of the Wayne family.</i>

441
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,040
Everything is under control.

442
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,320
<i>So you say.</i>

443
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,560
<i>The fact is, you've lost sight
of your mission.</i>

444
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,560
<i>Sending men with swords into Gotham.</i>

445
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,720
<i>Freaks armed with freeze guns.</i>

446
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,040
There have been missteps,
I grant you.

447
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,040
But look at all we've accomplished.

448
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,200
<i>We do not care about your monsters.</i>

449
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:29,400
<i>What do they have to do
with restoring the dead to life?</i>

450
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,760
Physical regeneration has always
been a necessary part

451
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,080
of bringing back the dead.

452
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,240
I had to resort to any means
necessary

453
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,240
to make humans stronger, faster...

454
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,360
<i>Be that as it may, you have failed
at your core objective.</i>

455
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,640
That is not true.

456
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,800
<i>Immortality means returning to life
with one's mind</i>

457
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,080
<i>and memories intact
and you have not.</i>

458
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,040
Oh, but I have.

459
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,960
<i>When?</i>

460
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,080
Today.

461
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,840
I brought someone back.

462
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,960
Memories, emotion, the soul itself.

463
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,560
Back from death.

464
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,080
<i>If you're lying...</i>

465
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,040
I am not.

466
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,000
<i>Can you repeat the process?</i>

467
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,640
If given time, I believe so.

468
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,560
Very well.

469
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,000
<i>Find out what the Wayne boy
and his companions know.</i>

470
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,760
<i>Move everything you can
to the facility upstate.</i>

471
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,120
<i>Then destroy any evidence
of Indian Hill.</i>

472
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,560
- By destroy, you mean...
<i>- You have an explosive device.</i>

473
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,760
<i>Use it.</i>

474
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,400
<i>Destroy Indian Hill.</i>

475
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,320
What's this?

476
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,080
It's a grilled cheese sandwich.

477
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,040
You made me a sandwich?

478
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,040
Yeah.

479
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,840
Why?

480
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,680
I don't know.

481
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,000
You told me to.

482
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,040
Wait.

483
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,640
I don't know what to do, Bridgit.

484
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,080
It's simple.

485
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,840
You can die.

486
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,640
Drop it!

487
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,840
Don't make me hurt you.

488
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,960
You think you can hurt me?

489
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,520
I am the Goddess of Fire.

490
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,280
You're not the goddess of anything.
You're Bridgit.

491
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,320
We grew up together.
We're friends!

492
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,240
When my mom left, you took me in.

493
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,120
- Goddesses don't have friends.
- Says who?

494
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,640
The professor.

495
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,840
He told me who I am.

496
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,160
Screw him.

497
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,400
Remember the pigeons?

498
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,800
How we used to feed them?

499
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,240
It's me, Selina.

500
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,680
You, you gotta remember.

501
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,160
I...

502
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:23,360
Cale flamed up good
but Joe burned the brightest.

503
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,600
Okay, yeah.

504
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,000
Yeah, you fried your brothers.

505
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,960
Not the memory I was hoping for,
but it's something.

506
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,200
You'll burn bright.

507
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,760
I know it.

508
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,320
No, no.

509
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,560
I am Firefly.

510
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,680
Fire cannot not touch me.

511
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,480
Oh, crap.

512
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,840
You're the Goddess of Fire, right?

513
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,800
Right?

514
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,720
Goddesses have servants and stuff.

515
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,880
Let me be your servant.

516
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,600
Why do I need a servant?

517
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,360
You can't be a goddess
without a servant.

518
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,400
Come on, it's totally part
of the story.

519
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,080
The professor just forgot
to tell you.

520
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,520
You gotta have a servant.

521
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,640
I guess that's true.

522
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,160
Hello.

523
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,720
Oh, man.

524
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,240
Double shifts until I say otherwise.

525
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,720
And I want everyone in a uniform
out on the streets.

526
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,880
Bullock!

527
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,240
Gordon, Master Bruce and Fox
are still in Arkham.

528
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,800
They should be out by now.
They're in trouble.

529
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,560
That son of a bitch!

530
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,920
Jim Gordon, I mean.
He's forcing my hand.

531
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,320
Are you listening to me?

532
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,800
Grab your gun, your badge, and
your bits and your bobs and let's go.

533
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,000
Hold on a second, okay?

534
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,320
You're talking about a place
that's built like a fortress,

535
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,160
chock-a-block with armed guards.

536
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,520
Now while we could send in
an assault force

537
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:19,320
of a middle-aged Irish detective
and a recently-stabbed Englishman.

538
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:24,240
I think the acting captain of the
GCPD could do a little better.

539
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,440
Right.

540
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,520
Go get our guys.

541
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,120
Bravo Team, on me.

542
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,560
Lucius.

543
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:48,960
Bruce, are you okay?

544
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,160
I'm fine. Where's Gordon?

545
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,320
I haven't seen him.

546
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,840
I'm sorry I got you into this,
Lucius.

547
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,760
It seems likely we're all going
to die in here.

548
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,960
Don't say that.

549
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,560
I don't mind dying.

550
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,880
I mind that I got you and Jim Gordon
and Selina Kyle involved.

551
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,840
Bruce, you are a remarkable
young man

552
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,600
but you didn't force any of us
to do anything.

553
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,760
We chose.

554
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,880
Hugo Strange said that all this time

555
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,080
I'd been searching for the man
who killed my parents

556
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,920
when really it was my own father.

557
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,480
That he knew what he was doing.

558
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,000
That I am my father's son.

559
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,400
Bruce, your father had the courage
to fight for what he believed in.

560
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,960
And as long as there is life,
there is hope.

561
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,720
<i>Touching sentiment.</i>

562
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,840
Who are you?
Where is Jim Gordon?

563
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,040
Yeah.

564
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,200
I would urge you to worry
about yourselves right now.

565
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,800
Jim Gordon has his own problems.

566
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,520
Strange, you son of a bitch!

567
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,920
Where's Bruce Wayne?

568
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,400
- If you've hurt him...
- Bruce Wayne is alive.

569
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,160
For now.

570
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:16,080
Try me and that may change.

571
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,680
You won't get away with this.

572
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,800
People know we're here.

573
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,280
They're already on their way
to stop you.

574
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:24,560
Yes. And I'm afraid I simply
can't allow that.

575
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,680
The work that I'm doing here
is too important

576
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,600
and at too critical a juncture.

577
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:32,600
But fortunately,
a solution has presented itself.

578
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,720
Gentlemen.

579
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,600
- What are you doing?
- Hold still.

580
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,880
The solution is very important.

581
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,720
You must not spill a drop.

582
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,920
<i>So here's the situation.</i>

583
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,200
Professor Strange has tasked me
with finding out

584
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,840
how much you two know
about what he's been up to.

585
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,080
And, more importantly, who you told.

586
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,520
Show us Jim Gordon and Selina Kyle.

587
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:23,320
<i>Think you're not quite grasping
the power dynamic here, Turtleneck.</i>

588
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,000
As I was saying.

589
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,800
We need to know what you know.

590
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,440
And you're gonna tell me

591
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:37,240
<i>or poison gas will spew
from the nozzles above your head</i>

592
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:41,480
<i>and you will both die
very, very painfully.</i>

593
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,880
I know this voice.

594
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,440
He worked for the GCPD.

595
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,000
<i>He had a funny kind of name.</i>

596
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,360
There's nothing funny about my name.

597
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,440
He was the one that framed
Jim Gordon.

598
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,600
You always were a smart cookie, Foxy.

599
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,440
<i>Do you know why Strange gave me
this job?</i>

600
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,200
<i>It's because he knows that I would
kill you both and not bat an eye.</i>

601
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,640
So, keeping that in mind,

602
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,840
<i>five minutes on the clock.</i>

603
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,080
Starting...

604
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,040
now.

605
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,800
Fun.

606
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,480
What the hell was that?

607
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,840
You'll see.

608
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,520
Allow me to introduce, Basil.

609
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,280
Basil just woke up this morning,
didn't you, son?

610
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,400
Yep.

611
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,520
He was confused, poor soul.

612
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:48,720
He had forgotten who he was, until
I reminded him of his great talent.

613
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,360
You see, Basil is a gifted performer.

614
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,240
A chameleon of sorts.

615
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,440
Would you like to see?

616
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,640
You belong in your own asylum,
Strange.

617
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,160
And you, James Gordon,
belong in the past.

618
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,600
The world has moved on.

619
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,920
While you and others like you
were living your sad, normal lives,

620
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,720
I was pushing the boundaries
of evolution.

621
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:18,960
The future belongs to my children
and that future is here.

622
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,120
Inbound to Arkham Asylum.

623
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,560
Strike force ready.

624
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,720
<i>Tell me what you know.</i>

625
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,200
Astonishing.

626
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,840
Oh, yes, oh, yes.
The finishing touch.

627
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,200
Introduce yourself, son.

628
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,840
Nice to meet you.

629
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,960
What the hell?

630
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,760
Nice to meet you.

631
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,920
You son of a bitch!

632
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,200
Son of a bitch!

633
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,160
Nice to meet you.

634
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,920
I'm Jim Gordon.
