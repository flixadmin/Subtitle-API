1
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:01,686
JAPANESE DIALOGUE
IS SUBTITLED IN YELLOW

2
00:01:01,769 --> 00:01:04,563
ALL OTHER SUBTITLED DIALOGUE
IS KOREAN

3
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:12,089
You little brats, get lost!

4
00:02:18,262 --> 00:02:19,096
Hey!

5
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,132
It should have been me!

6
00:02:55,549 --> 00:03:00,049
I should be the one
going to that Jap's house.

7
00:03:02,973 --> 00:03:04,849
You'll miss the train.

8
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,186
Hurry.

9
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:19,694
PART ONE

10
00:03:44,932 --> 00:03:47,309
KOUZUKI NORIAKI

11
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,527
Go back to sleep.

12
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,779
We're still far from the house.

13
00:04:38,986 --> 00:04:41,363
Pleased to meet you. I am Okju.

14
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,240
This property has three buildings.

15
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:45,534
A Western-style wing designed
by an English architect

16
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:48,037
and a Japanese wing form the main house.

17
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:52,040
Not even in Japan is there
a building combining the two styles.

18
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:58,209
It reflects Master's admiration
for Japan and England.

19
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,176
Next is the annex

20
00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:04,719
which Master had furnished as a library.

21
00:05:05,095 --> 00:05:06,846
Last, the servants' quarters.

22
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:09,266
As the Lady's handmaiden,
you won't sleep there.

23
00:05:10,142 --> 00:05:12,310
You may eat her leftover food,

24
00:05:12,394 --> 00:05:14,771
but tea leaves go to the kitchen girls.

25
00:05:14,855 --> 00:05:17,065
Used soap and oil are for the steward.

26
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:20,069
Anyone caught stealing
is expelled that day.

27
00:05:20,152 --> 00:05:22,445
I'm sure you wouldn't dare, Tamako.

28
00:05:23,113 --> 00:05:27,613
"Tamako" is you, by the way.
It's your name Okju in Japanese.

29
00:05:28,702 --> 00:05:30,662
Everything in this household
is Japanese style.

30
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:35,000
Use only Japanese to Master and the Lady.

31
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:38,671
-Call me Sasaki.
-Yes, ma'am.

32
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:45,761
I don't trust new handmaidens.

33
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,763
Even though they greet you politely,

34
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:51,016
they are always the first to take scrolls
and run away when there's a fire.

35
00:05:56,230 --> 00:06:00,730
The Lady's routine is simple.
She takes walks or reads for Master.

36
00:06:03,737 --> 00:06:07,407
Among the richest men,
Master is the greatest book lover.

37
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:10,660
And among book lovers, he is the richest.

38
00:06:10,744 --> 00:06:13,705
His ties to the colonial government
even let us use electricity.

39
00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:15,373
In such a home,

40
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:20,295
you should know what's expected
of a maid like you.

41
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:25,884
Don't be alarmed at the blackouts.

42
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,702
I sleep in here?

43
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:57,249
Miss Hideko wakes easily
on account of her nerves.

44
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,793
-She's behind this door?
-Sh!

45
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,896
Mother!

46
00:08:05,901 --> 00:08:07,569
Mother!

47
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:09,655
Mother!

48
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:12,491
Miss!

49
00:08:12,908 --> 00:08:14,951
Miss, are you alright?

50
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,204
Junko! Is that you?

51
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:21,541
Junko was kicked out, Miss.
I'm the new girl.

52
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:24,044
You must have had a bad dream.

53
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,714
You see that big cherry tree?

54
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:32,010
My aunt went mad and hanged herself there.

55
00:08:33,512 --> 00:08:35,514
Sometimes on moonless nights,

56
00:08:35,597 --> 00:08:37,390
my aunt's ghost

57
00:08:37,474 --> 00:08:40,810
dangles from that branch.

58
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:55,367
Here, drink up.

59
00:08:59,246 --> 00:09:03,746
When babies cry,
my auntie feeds them a spoonful of sake.

60
00:09:09,506 --> 00:09:13,051
Sweet bird, sweet bird

61
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:17,097
My sweet bluebird

62
00:09:20,976 --> 00:09:25,476
What scent is this, that fills my nose?

63
00:09:55,677 --> 00:09:58,262
Those fuckers.

64
00:10:00,682 --> 00:10:01,766
This is Tamako.

65
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:04,727
I am at your service, Miss.

66
00:10:17,157 --> 00:10:21,119
A reference letter from Lady Minami,
my last mistress.

67
00:10:25,457 --> 00:10:27,917
So is this place to your liking?

68
00:10:30,337 --> 00:10:33,173
The sun scarcely ever shines here.

69
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:35,092
Uncle won't permit it.

70
00:10:36,176 --> 00:10:38,678
Sunlight causes books to fade.

71
00:10:39,763 --> 00:10:42,307
One could never grow fond
of such a dreary place.

72
00:10:47,896 --> 00:10:50,023
Not a good liar, are you?

73
00:10:52,025 --> 00:10:54,986
We look alike.

74
00:10:56,029 --> 00:10:57,572
Don't you think?

75
00:10:57,656 --> 00:10:59,616
I'll take my leave.

76
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,746
My late aunt

77
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,706
and Mrs. Sasaki

78
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:10,960
tried very hard to teach me
of a mother's love.

79
00:11:12,796 --> 00:11:14,005
But not really.

80
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:26,977
My head aches
before every reading practice.

81
00:11:30,105 --> 00:11:31,523
Would you read it to me?

82
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,734
Pardon?

83
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:44,995
Oh, how kind of her.

84
00:11:45,078 --> 00:11:48,873
Lady Minami said
such nice things about me!

85
00:11:48,957 --> 00:11:49,791
Is that so?

86
00:11:53,378 --> 00:11:57,878
You're a Japanese lady,
why don't you speak Japanese?

87
00:11:58,717 --> 00:11:59,884
I'm sick of it.

88
00:11:59,968 --> 00:12:02,470
The books he makes me read
are all Japanese.

89
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,099
So read that for me.

90
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:20,155
"Dear Miss Izumi Hideko,

91
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:25,577
Count Fujiwara said
you're looking for a maid.

92
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,704
Maids are like...

93
00:12:28,288 --> 00:12:29,747
a spoon... no...

94
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,377
are like chopsticks..."

95
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,008
Is it a spoon?

96
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,269
I don't know how to read, Miss.

97
00:12:54,314 --> 00:12:56,524
Not at all? What about Korean?

98
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:24,135
This is your name. Can't you read it?

99
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:32,894
Reading can be learned,

100
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:36,314
and I don't care if you curse or steal.

101
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,533
But don't ever lie to me. Understood?

102
00:13:48,535 --> 00:13:49,661
Yes, Miss.

103
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:55,667
She's my mother.

104
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,838
She's beautiful, quite the charmer!

105
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,384
And me? Am I "quite the charmer"?

106
00:14:06,678 --> 00:14:09,764
Everyone says
I can't compare to my mother.

107
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:16,313
Count Fujiwara said...

108
00:14:16,938 --> 00:14:18,898
So you've met the Count?

109
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,275
Pardon?

110
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,027
No, I've never met him...

111
00:14:22,944 --> 00:14:25,780
My aunt! I heard it from my aunt.

112
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:28,157
She was his nanny.

113
00:14:28,658 --> 00:14:30,868
What did the Count say about me?

114
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:34,414
He said your face...

115
00:14:35,874 --> 00:14:40,128
Every night in bed he thinks
of your assets... your face.

116
00:14:43,256 --> 00:14:45,341
Why in bed, I wonder?

117
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,847
What's with your foot?

118
00:14:57,562 --> 00:14:59,230
I've nowhere to go.

119
00:15:00,315 --> 00:15:03,359
I've just stayed in this house
since coming to Korea when I was 5.

120
00:15:05,695 --> 00:15:09,490
But in new shoes, even paths
I always take seem different.

121
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,618
The ones from here

122
00:15:12,619 --> 00:15:14,495
up to here should fit you.

123
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,128
Why don't you pick something prettier?
Like this one.

124
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,090
It's time for reading practice.

125
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,176
-I'll go alone.
-Miss?

126
00:15:28,718 --> 00:15:29,969
But it's raining.

127
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:50,736
At noon, come knock on the door. Okay?

128
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,745
See you at--

129
00:16:34,075 --> 00:16:34,909
This is...

130
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,389
My new handmaiden.

131
00:18:21,808 --> 00:18:23,226
The snake, the snake!

132
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:31,442
You mustn't pass that point.

133
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,945
Be warned!

134
00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:37,031
The snake marks the "bounds of knowledge".

135
00:18:52,255 --> 00:18:55,508
He has a habit of licking the pen
when he's thinking hard.

136
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:57,635
He's not a dirty person.

137
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:02,807
What kind of a handmaiden
uses the umbrella for herself?

138
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:03,725
Pardon?

139
00:19:05,268 --> 00:19:06,102
Miss.

140
00:19:06,561 --> 00:19:07,728
Miss!

141
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:13,902
Miss.

142
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,118
I don't have an upset stomach.
It's okay.

143
00:19:24,829 --> 00:19:26,789
It's because the books are so boring.

144
00:19:27,999 --> 00:19:30,793
You must read a ton of books.

145
00:19:30,877 --> 00:19:33,045
You must be so knowledgeable.

146
00:19:43,556 --> 00:19:45,015
I'm sorry about the prank.

147
00:19:45,892 --> 00:19:46,934
I won't do it again.

148
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,187
Forgive me.

149
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:13,878
The Count?

150
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:15,922
Today?

151
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:22,303
No wonder you insisted on a bath.

152
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:25,139
When my aunt heard
a guest was coming,

153
00:20:25,223 --> 00:20:27,850
she dropped everything
and bathed her Baby Miss.

154
00:20:28,643 --> 00:20:33,143
Nothing made her happier than
when guests praised the baby's scent.

155
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:37,402
You are my Baby Miss.

156
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,864
Auntie gives babies candy during baths

157
00:20:41,948 --> 00:20:44,033
to teach them how sweet bath time is.

158
00:20:45,034 --> 00:20:45,868
What's wrong?

159
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:51,207
One of my teeth must be sharp.
It keeps cutting me.

160
00:21:36,961 --> 00:21:38,379
So this was the scent.

161
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:38,606
It's smooth now.

162
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:55,581
Welcome, sir!

163
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:09,512
You are too kind to greet me
like this upon my arrival,

164
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:12,849
when the journey has left me so unkempt.

165
00:23:12,932 --> 00:23:14,266
Now your tedium is over.

166
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:19,063
I'll ensure your painting lessons
are stimulating.

167
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,484
This must be Okju.

168
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,903
At your service, milord.

169
00:23:27,113 --> 00:23:30,616
You know if you fail,
it'll put me in an awkward position?

170
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:36,330
A decent bone structure for a Korean...

171
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:40,543
So, are you carrying out
your duties faithfully?

172
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:43,129
Thank you for introducing her.

173
00:23:43,212 --> 00:23:47,712
You found the perfect maid for me.

174
00:23:50,511 --> 00:23:54,014
It was tough looking for one
that wasn't chubby.

175
00:23:54,974 --> 00:23:58,185
Take care of the lonely lady.

176
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:00,480
Here.

177
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:24,044
Count Fujiwara asks Miss Hideko
to kindly allow her maid Tamako

178
00:24:24,128 --> 00:24:27,714
to be sent to his Lordship
for a brief errand.

179
00:24:36,182 --> 00:24:38,642
Did you call for me, milord?

180
00:24:38,726 --> 00:24:39,560
You may enter.

181
00:25:19,475 --> 00:25:21,560
You tried to fool me with a fake coin.

182
00:25:21,644 --> 00:25:23,145
How dare you?

183
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:32,821
You think I'm Tamako,
a poor Korean handmaiden.

184
00:25:33,364 --> 00:25:36,241
But my real name is Nam Sookee.

185
00:25:36,784 --> 00:25:41,284
Raised by Miss Boksun,
top purveyor of stolen goods.

186
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:47,253
I was able to tell a real coin
from a fake when I was 5.

187
00:25:47,336 --> 00:25:50,422
Then learned to forge stamps from Gugai,

188
00:25:50,506 --> 00:25:54,092
and pickpocketing from Kutan,

189
00:25:54,927 --> 00:25:58,221
but these babies will never
learn such useful skills.

190
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:01,308
Abandoned as newborns,

191
00:26:01,392 --> 00:26:04,520
we'll wash and feed them,
then sell them to Japan.

192
00:26:04,979 --> 00:26:06,814
What meaningful work.

193
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:11,235
Instead of starving, they grow up
to be rich gentlemen and ladies.

194
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,820
Kutan only breastfeeds her own kid.
I wouldn't be so miserly.

195
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:21,950
I wish my breasts gave milk.
I'd breastfeed all of them.

196
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:32,965
Count!

197
00:27:03,412 --> 00:27:06,456
I'll tell you the story of an interpreter,

198
00:27:07,708 --> 00:27:12,208
who bribed his way
into translating for high officials.

199
00:27:13,339 --> 00:27:17,634
After helping Japan annex Korea,
he got rights to a gold mine.

200
00:27:18,427 --> 00:27:20,595
Now he wants to turn fully Japanese.

201
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:24,642
So he gets naturalized,

202
00:27:25,434 --> 00:27:28,520
marries the daughter
of a fallen Japanese noble,

203
00:27:29,063 --> 00:27:32,399
and adopts his wife's family name Kouzuki.

204
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:37,905
Ba... bas...

205
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:42,489
That bastard builds a mansion,
fills it with books and antiques.

206
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:48,540
He invites Japanese collectors
to his library,

207
00:27:48,624 --> 00:27:52,669
holds readings of rare books,
and auctions the books off.

208
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:56,048
He loves books and paintings
like his own flesh,

209
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:57,550
but he can't help parting with a few.

210
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:01,553
What to do, when he must sell,
but can't bear to?

211
00:28:01,637 --> 00:28:03,096
He sells a fake.

212
00:28:06,392 --> 00:28:10,892
He seeks out a specialist
to create intricate forgeries.

213
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:13,941
Unlike him, this specialist...

214
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:16,485
is a real Japanese of noble birth!

215
00:28:18,529 --> 00:28:21,448
Count Fujiwara from Nagoya.

216
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:26,245
So, who is this?

217
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:30,165
It's the wife. His Japanese wife.

218
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:34,545
-You'll seduce her--
-Is she pretty?

219
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:37,423
The Jap wife died ages ago
with no children.

220
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:42,590
But the dead wife's
dead sister's living daughter

221
00:28:42,678 --> 00:28:44,137
performs those book readings.

222
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,431
But is she pretty?

223
00:28:46,098 --> 00:28:48,100
She's an orphan. Her father was rich.

224
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:52,480
Soon she'll fall in love with me,
and we'll elope to Japan.

225
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:54,356
After marrying her there

226
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:59,399
and inheriting her fortune,
I'll declare her insane

227
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:01,447
and lock her up in a madhouse.

228
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:02,739
Right!

229
00:29:03,699 --> 00:29:06,993
Sookee will be my mouse,
work as her maid,

230
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,497
eavesdrop on her sleep talking,

231
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,081
and hand her over to me.

232
00:29:11,749 --> 00:29:16,249
Stay by her side during the day
and gently persuade her to fall in love.

233
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:18,339
Love?

234
00:29:19,173 --> 00:29:20,799
What does a crook know about love?

235
00:29:26,847 --> 00:29:29,558
What about her fortune?
Is she rich for sure?

236
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:34,313
Every night in bed
I think of her assets.

237
00:29:34,897 --> 00:29:37,608
1.5 million in cash. 300,000 in bonds.

238
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:43,990
The uncle is just a guardian.
It's Hideko's fortune.

239
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:47,785
That's why Kouzuki
schemes to marry the girl.

240
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,538
To his w... wife's niece?

241
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,331
What a s... sick f... f...

242
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:53,999
Right, a sick fuck.

243
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:58,295
So what's our share?

244
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,423
I'll share 50,000.

245
00:30:01,507 --> 00:30:03,717
Sookee also gets
the dresses and jewellery.

246
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:06,428
I'll do it! Take me!

247
00:30:06,512 --> 00:30:09,681
My Japanese is better,
and I've worked as a maid before!

248
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:25,030
On top of the fifty,

249
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:30,786
I get dresses, jewellery
and my own 100,000.

250
00:30:33,497 --> 00:30:36,791
B... b... beautiful!

251
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:39,712
... I... I'm utterly speechless
in your presence!

252
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:44,591
If you stutter like that
and make your face go red,

253
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:47,261
those uppity bitches will feel superior,

254
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,347
and then they'll open up to you,
all right?

255
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,140
Now, how to make your face go red.

256
00:30:51,223 --> 00:30:53,725
Listen carefully. Breathe in,

257
00:30:53,809 --> 00:30:56,019
pull in your stomach,

258
00:30:56,103 --> 00:30:59,064
pull your chin down
and tighten your butthole,

259
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:01,441
then hold your breath
and swallow your saliva ten times.

260
00:31:01,942 --> 00:31:02,776
Get it?

261
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:05,112
Let's just try it.

262
00:31:19,877 --> 00:31:23,338
Would you like to wear a navy kimono
with white peonies

263
00:31:23,422 --> 00:31:25,841
or a black kimono with cranes?

264
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:30,053
Would you like to wear
a caterpillar patterned poop color

265
00:31:30,137 --> 00:31:32,556
or a poop patterned caterpillar color?

266
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,352
Don't ask! If you ask a question,
she'll start to think.

267
00:31:36,852 --> 00:31:39,354
You think, and she doesn't.

268
00:31:39,438 --> 00:31:41,606
That's how you control the Miss.

269
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:42,691
All right?

270
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:43,609
All right.

271
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,449
Here's the letter. Pay attention.

272
00:31:53,869 --> 00:31:55,829
"Dear Miss Izumi Hideko,

273
00:31:55,913 --> 00:32:00,413
Count Fujiwara has informed me
of your urgent need for a maid.

274
00:32:01,293 --> 00:32:04,629
A maid is like a pair of chopsticks.

275
00:32:04,713 --> 00:32:09,008
Her presence is little noted, but
her absence causes much distress."

276
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:14,807
Did my mom cry before they hanged her?

277
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,601
Women who stole once

278
00:32:18,644 --> 00:32:21,897
and got hanged cried.

279
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,691
They cried a lot.

280
00:32:26,026 --> 00:32:29,988
Your mother stole a thousand times,

281
00:32:30,072 --> 00:32:33,700
was caught just once and died once.

282
00:32:35,661 --> 00:32:36,787
Did she cry?

283
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:42,751
She laughed.

284
00:32:43,752 --> 00:32:46,671
Said she was lucky
to have you before dying

285
00:32:46,755 --> 00:32:49,048
and that she had no regrets.

286
00:32:50,968 --> 00:32:54,596
You will surely become a brave thief.

287
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:08,986
It should have been me!

288
00:33:10,404 --> 00:33:14,904
I should be the one
going to that Jap's house.

289
00:33:27,421 --> 00:33:29,089
Everyone's talking about you in Eunpo,

290
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,843
how you'll be an even greater thief
than your mother.

291
00:33:33,427 --> 00:33:35,554
Who believes the words of a swindler?

292
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:41,393
When I give the signal,
"fully ripe",

293
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:43,520
arrange for her and me to be alone.

294
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:45,606
Then I'll gobble her up to the pit.

295
00:33:45,689 --> 00:33:48,942
She's so naive
she wouldn't know what a man wants

296
00:33:49,026 --> 00:33:51,403
even if he pulled on her nipples.

297
00:33:52,988 --> 00:33:54,614
So it's your job to tell her

298
00:33:54,698 --> 00:33:57,867
that everything is because of me.

299
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:01,121
"Oh my, since the Count arrived,

300
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:03,874
your toenails are growing much faster!"

301
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:07,002
That sort of thing, all right?

302
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:09,505
Here, a gift.

303
00:34:21,767 --> 00:34:24,227
Oh, he's so thoughtful!

304
00:34:25,854 --> 00:34:28,565
That'll be mine
when she goes to the madhouse.

305
00:34:29,608 --> 00:34:33,069
It pains my heart to see this poor girl.

306
00:34:33,153 --> 00:34:35,697
Have you ever seen sapphires so blue?

307
00:34:39,493 --> 00:34:41,119
Let's take a look...

308
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:46,875
This isn't a sapphire, it's blue spinel.

309
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:52,673
It's all right, Miss.
Spinets are expensive too.

310
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:55,133
How do you know?

311
00:34:55,926 --> 00:35:00,096
Oh, my Auntie...
I mean, Lady Minami taught me.

312
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:02,474
But it's fine!

313
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:04,142
There's no need to be ashamed at all.

314
00:35:04,226 --> 00:35:06,811
Your average fence
can barely tell them apart.

315
00:35:06,895 --> 00:35:07,854
Is that so?

316
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:25,289
Of all the things
I've washed and dressed,

317
00:35:26,123 --> 00:35:28,250
has anything been this pretty?

318
00:35:30,502 --> 00:35:32,795
I'd like to show her
to the people at home.

319
00:35:34,381 --> 00:35:35,673
What would they say?

320
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:39,469
Probably this?

321
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,057
Mesmerizing!

322
00:35:44,141 --> 00:35:47,811
S... spellbindingly beautiful!

323
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:55,777
He's shameless.

324
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:04,411
The Count kept offering me wine.

325
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:12,544
Does it feel okay?

326
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:16,757
It's suffocating.
How do ladies wear such things?

327
00:36:17,716 --> 00:36:19,217
You think this is suffocating?

328
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:22,596
Miss, you're killing me!

329
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:29,186
Dressed up, you look like a lady too.

330
00:36:33,982 --> 00:36:35,400
I think I know

331
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:39,071
what the Count meant.

332
00:36:40,989 --> 00:36:42,240
Your face...

333
00:36:44,201 --> 00:36:45,660
Every night in bed,

334
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,663
I think of your face.

335
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,211
Don't be silly, Miss.

336
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:04,387
Ladies truly are the dolls of maids.

337
00:37:05,764 --> 00:37:09,893
All these buttons are for my amusement.

338
00:37:11,061 --> 00:37:13,480
If I undo the buttons
and pull out the cords,

339
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:18,527
then the sweet things within,

340
00:37:19,194 --> 00:37:21,529
those sweet and soft things...

341
00:37:23,949 --> 00:37:28,411
If I were still a pickpocket
I'd slip my hand inside...

342
00:38:01,695 --> 00:38:05,365
Miss, are you truly going
to marry your uncle?

343
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:13,123
That's what he raised me for,
knowing he'd need my fortune.

344
00:38:14,249 --> 00:38:16,417
There's a famous collector in France.

345
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:19,796
He'll be putting his entire library up
for auction.

346
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,591
The gold mine's proceeds
won't cover the cost.

347
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:29,014
If it were me, I'd sell books to buy gold,
not the opposite.

348
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:34,394
Have you ever thought of
marrying someone else?

349
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,188
Like Count Fujiwara, for example--

350
00:38:36,271 --> 00:38:39,565
You're very nosy for a handmaiden.

351
00:39:07,427 --> 00:39:08,886
For now,

352
00:39:09,304 --> 00:39:11,431
the Lady needn't go read
to the sick fuck,

353
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,475
who wants to marry his wife's niece.

354
00:39:15,602 --> 00:39:19,939
Instead the fake Count goes
to the Library to make fake books.

355
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:27,697
The Lady waits for her
2 o'clock art class,

356
00:39:27,781 --> 00:39:29,073
and waits...

357
00:39:31,451 --> 00:39:33,661
Poor girl,

358
00:39:33,745 --> 00:39:36,122
losing her heart to a fake.

359
00:40:10,782 --> 00:40:12,450
Please, Count!

360
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:07,172
Sorry to be late.

361
00:41:07,881 --> 00:41:09,215
It's fine.

362
00:41:17,432 --> 00:41:21,727
Maybe I need more practice
to give it dimensionality.

363
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:24,314
Dimensionality... perhaps.

364
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:27,818
Nonetheless, you have a vision
that transcends mere skill.

365
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:31,571
It's as if you see directly
into an object's essence.

366
00:41:32,572 --> 00:41:36,659
For example, the fact that this peach
contains a lot of water.

367
00:41:37,744 --> 00:41:40,204
I hesitate to stand before you,

368
00:41:40,288 --> 00:41:42,373
for fear that you might read my thoughts.

369
00:41:57,556 --> 00:41:58,848
That's enough for today.

370
00:42:05,772 --> 00:42:07,315
Almost fully ripe.

371
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:09,401
Already?

372
00:42:14,197 --> 00:42:15,323
Damn...

373
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:20,578
Do you know what?

374
00:42:20,662 --> 00:42:24,374
Since the Count arrived,
your cheeks have grown flushed.

375
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:25,375
Have they?

376
00:42:31,923 --> 00:42:34,216
How did your mother die?

377
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:40,344
When I was a baby,
at a big house, she was hanged...

378
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:44,811
-I mean, she hanged--
-Hanged herself like my aunt, huh?

379
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:47,355
Well, pretty much.

380
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:59,284
She must have often hugged you
when she was alive, right?

381
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:07,667
My mother died giving birth to me.

382
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:13,544
So it's as if I strangled her myself.

383
00:43:17,552 --> 00:43:20,179
I wish I'd never been born.

384
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:26,978
No baby is ever guilty of being born.

385
00:43:28,146 --> 00:43:30,439
If your mother thought
you could understand

386
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:32,776
this is what she'd have said.

387
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:37,196
That she was so lucky
to have you before dying,

388
00:43:38,281 --> 00:43:39,865
that she had no regrets.

389
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:48,625
Wait here a moment, Miss.

390
00:43:50,168 --> 00:43:51,419
I'll go pick mushrooms.

391
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:56,549
We'll have mushroom stew tonight,
you like that.

392
00:43:56,633 --> 00:43:58,134
I'll go with you.

393
00:43:59,302 --> 00:44:00,553
I'll be quick.

394
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:02,555
Before it rains.

395
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:13,024
Good girl--

396
00:44:18,363 --> 00:44:20,365
What a coincidence.

397
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:22,033
Indeed.

398
00:44:22,492 --> 00:44:23,743
May I sit next to you?

399
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:53,773
The lady sits, shy and trembling.

400
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:56,693
The gentleman is persistent.

401
00:44:57,485 --> 00:45:01,155
The perceptive maid
has stepped out for a moment.

402
00:45:02,407 --> 00:45:04,659
All is well, Sookee.

403
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:08,455
Everyone's performing
their roles so damned well.

404
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:11,291
Damn.

405
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:19,298
You know servants can't use this entrance!

406
00:45:28,141 --> 00:45:28,975
Hey!

407
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:37,359
I wish I'd never come here.

408
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:42,071
It was wrong to come.

409
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:46,743
Tamako, you brought watercolors, right?

410
00:45:47,744 --> 00:45:49,579
Of course, milord!

411
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:51,081
Watercolor paints and brushes--

412
00:45:51,164 --> 00:45:53,249
Go and get the oils.

413
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:56,836
A day like this demands oils!

414
00:46:19,734 --> 00:46:20,776
Shit!

415
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:27,325
Lady!

416
00:46:29,202 --> 00:46:30,745
Milord!

417
00:46:44,759 --> 00:46:45,760
Lady...

418
00:47:07,532 --> 00:47:10,117
A blackout! Bring a lantern.

419
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:31,264
I need to think.

420
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:34,100
I need to become rich,

421
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:38,813
sail off to a distant harbor,
eat food I scarcely recognize,

422
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:41,608
buy my fill of glittering baubles,
and...

423
00:47:42,275 --> 00:47:43,818
not think of Hideko.

424
00:47:45,403 --> 00:47:46,904
Never think of Hideko--

425
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,143
I returned
and you didn't even come to me.

426
00:48:18,561 --> 00:48:21,146
It was late, I must have fallen asleep.
My apologies.

427
00:48:22,899 --> 00:48:25,735
You know how hard it is
to do those readings?

428
00:48:26,694 --> 00:48:29,697
Must I remove my makeup
and change all by myself?

429
00:48:30,907 --> 00:48:32,909
I feel a nightmare coming. Sleep here.

430
00:48:58,935 --> 00:49:00,561
He proposed to me.

431
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:05,358
On the 15th,

432
00:49:06,943 --> 00:49:10,947
when my uncle visits his mine,
he wants to elope to Japan.

433
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:15,660
What did you say?

434
00:49:18,663 --> 00:49:20,373
I said I wasn't sure.

435
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:21,291
Why?

436
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:23,126
I'm scared.

437
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:25,545
Of your uncle's anger?

438
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:29,132
Of the Count.

439
00:49:31,801 --> 00:49:34,386
What's to be scared of? He's so kind.

440
00:49:37,056 --> 00:49:39,016
I don't know, I just feel it.

441
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:45,940
It's like the reflex of pulling
your hand back from a flame.

442
00:49:49,777 --> 00:49:50,903
Tell me...

443
00:49:59,662 --> 00:50:01,538
What is it that men want?

444
00:50:05,251 --> 00:50:06,085
Pardon?

445
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:11,007
I mean after getting married, at night...

446
00:50:14,844 --> 00:50:17,721
How would I know?
I'm practically a child

447
00:50:17,805 --> 00:50:21,683
with no mother.
There's no one here to...

448
00:50:27,857 --> 00:50:28,732
First,

449
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:32,904
I guess we'd kiss?

450
00:50:36,032 --> 00:50:36,866
And?

451
00:50:39,118 --> 00:50:40,577
He would hold you in his arms.

452
00:50:41,412 --> 00:50:42,246
Standing?

453
00:50:43,748 --> 00:50:46,917
Only when there's nowhere to lie down
or you're in a hurry.

454
00:50:47,001 --> 00:50:49,878
Normally you do it on the bed.

455
00:50:50,838 --> 00:50:52,589
You'll know when it happens.

456
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:54,717
It's just like drinking
for the first time.

457
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:55,968
When it happens?

458
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:00,640
But...

459
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:04,477
Could someone be like a blind person,

460
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:09,106
not being able to feel it?

461
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:12,151
What the hell.

462
00:51:12,777 --> 00:51:14,695
I'll show her one thing
then put her to bed.

463
00:51:17,490 --> 00:51:18,491
Poor thing,

464
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:23,075
alone in a strange country,
reading those useless books,

465
00:51:25,873 --> 00:51:28,417
without learning a single useful skill.

466
00:51:46,102 --> 00:51:48,229
Why does the candy taste different?

467
00:51:49,897 --> 00:51:53,108
The bitterness turns sour,

468
00:51:53,192 --> 00:51:56,111
the sourness turns sweet,

469
00:51:56,738 --> 00:52:00,199
the sweetness turns savoury...

470
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:01,784
How do you know all this?

471
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:04,996
Do you have experience?

472
00:52:07,665 --> 00:52:10,751
My friend Kutan taught me.

473
00:52:11,419 --> 00:52:13,671
Taught you? With words?

474
00:52:13,755 --> 00:52:16,090
Yes, only with words.

475
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:36,944
So this is how it feels.

476
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:40,198
That's what you will feel for the Count.

477
00:52:41,282 --> 00:52:42,199
Really?

478
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:44,577
The Count, truly...

479
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:50,541
He won't think
he's making love to a corpse?

480
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:54,837
You know about my cold hands and feet.

481
00:52:55,588 --> 00:52:56,672
Really?

482
00:52:57,423 --> 00:52:58,257
Here.

483
00:53:07,141 --> 00:53:08,851
It feels just fine.

484
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:10,228
You like it?

485
00:53:12,271 --> 00:53:15,107
Do it to me. I want to know how it feels.

486
00:53:19,612 --> 00:53:23,824
I'm sure he'll want to do this too.

487
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:25,534
And then...

488
00:53:32,583 --> 00:53:34,251
It's so cute.

489
00:53:36,879 --> 00:53:38,922
If the Count sees this...

490
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:52,269
Will he really be as tender as this?

491
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:54,438
Of course.

492
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:57,358
He'll also touch you like this.

493
00:53:57,775 --> 00:53:58,609
And like this...

494
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:04,865
Keep doing what the Count will.

495
00:54:08,077 --> 00:54:11,121
And this is what he'll say.

496
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:17,002
"It's so soft, warm,

497
00:54:18,796 --> 00:54:20,547
wet, and...

498
00:54:21,257 --> 00:54:25,302
S... S... spellbindingly beautiful!”

499
00:54:45,698 --> 00:54:47,825
Okju.

500
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:52,746
Hideko.

501
00:54:55,541 --> 00:54:57,918
Mom.

502
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:02,006
Dad.

503
00:55:03,508 --> 00:55:06,135
Now, the model must stay still.

504
00:55:06,969 --> 00:55:10,681
Okju.

505
00:55:14,769 --> 00:55:18,397
-Hideko...
-Wait.

506
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:19,899
Stop!

507
00:55:20,566 --> 00:55:24,194
...doesn't like it,
you damned scoundrel!

508
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:27,156
Stop it!

509
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,366
I can't do this.

510
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:33,579
Come here, Tamako.

511
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:39,418
Find something else to keep you busy.

512
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:40,628
Do you know what I mean?

513
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:52,765
I have nothing else to do.

514
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:56,143
My job is to look after the Lady.

515
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:10,658
I spit it out without chewing!
All because of you!

516
00:56:10,741 --> 00:56:12,743
She's fully ripe! Fully ripe!

517
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:14,453
If I miss this chance, I'm finished!

518
00:56:15,913 --> 00:56:18,290
Can you feel it?
How much I want it?

519
00:56:18,374 --> 00:56:22,874
After fighting so hard
to escape my garbage heap of a life,

520
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:26,924
you think I'll let you ruin it, you bitch?

521
00:56:27,008 --> 00:56:31,508
Shall I tell the Lady
you're nothing but a lowly pickpocket?

522
00:56:32,346 --> 00:56:35,766
Fine, I'll have something to tell her too.

523
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:39,895
That you're nothing but the son
of a lowly Korean farmhand and shaman--

524
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:41,355
Sookee.

525
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:43,482
Think of your family at home.

526
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:47,612
Boksun raising babies with her bad back
and those two idiots.

527
00:56:47,695 --> 00:56:50,030
How will they feel
if you go home empty-handed?

528
00:56:50,406 --> 00:56:51,907
Want to ruin your mother's reputation?

529
00:56:52,366 --> 00:56:54,326
You should go home in glory.

530
00:56:59,874 --> 00:57:03,502
So don't push Hideko too hard.

531
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:04,962
She's got no one on this earth.

532
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:08,132
If you frighten her,
she'll close up hard as a clam.

533
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:12,720
And please...

534
00:57:14,263 --> 00:57:18,763
Don't ever again put my hand
on your tiny joke of a cock.

535
00:57:28,069 --> 00:57:28,903
Oh my.

536
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:32,865
Your toenails have grown faster
since the Count arrived.

537
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:34,450
How curious.

538
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:39,872
Miss, doesn't it bother you not to know?

539
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:43,918
How many ships sail on the wide sea,

540
00:57:44,752 --> 00:57:47,045
people leaving, people returning,

541
00:57:47,588 --> 00:57:49,798
those saying farewell
or welcoming people back.

542
00:57:50,299 --> 00:57:52,342
Where is the farthest you've traveled?

543
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:53,886
The hill beyond the manor?

544
00:58:00,893 --> 00:58:05,063
My uncle will chase me wherever I go.

545
00:58:07,566 --> 00:58:09,818
This is how I lived my life.

546
00:58:12,363 --> 00:58:16,241
I could be content here,
if you are with me.

547
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:24,124
You can walk with me in new shoes,

548
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:26,418
tell me stories,

549
00:58:28,587 --> 00:58:32,299
and massage my feet.

550
00:58:34,802 --> 00:58:36,553
You're fortunate, Miss.

551
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:40,599
The man who loves you
has the power to protect you.

552
00:58:41,058 --> 00:58:42,684
That's rare.

553
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:47,773
But I'm not sure... if I love him.

554
00:58:49,108 --> 00:58:50,150
You do love him.

555
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:55,489
How do you know?

556
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:59,326
You stare out the window all day,

557
00:59:00,494 --> 00:59:02,579
turn in your sleep and sigh,

558
00:59:05,416 --> 00:59:06,750
and your toenails...

559
00:59:06,834 --> 00:59:08,544
What if I said I don't love him?

560
00:59:09,795 --> 00:59:12,672
What if I said that I love someone else?

561
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:18,512
I have no one on this earth...

562
00:59:19,138 --> 00:59:21,306
Would you still want me to marry him?

563
00:59:25,394 --> 00:59:26,728
You will love him.

564
00:59:42,495 --> 00:59:43,704
Miss!

565
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:32,127
In the end,

566
01:00:32,211 --> 01:00:36,048
Hideko accepted the proposal,
provided that I go to Japan too.

567
01:00:36,715 --> 01:00:38,591
The Count, after feigning annoyance
for a bit,

568
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:40,844
nodded his head.

569
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,807
On the day her Uncle left
to visit his mine,

570
01:00:44,890 --> 01:00:49,390
the Count pretended to go back
to Japan and hid nearby.

571
01:01:02,408 --> 01:01:04,910
You'll have a week of freedom,

572
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:10,495
but always remember the basement.

573
01:01:56,629 --> 01:01:57,796
Miss!

574
01:02:58,983 --> 01:03:03,483
Thank you for traveling
on our ferry today.

575
01:03:05,906 --> 01:03:10,406
We will arrive at Shimonoseki
at 7:30 p.m.--

576
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:19,794
We're finally going home.

577
01:03:20,462 --> 01:03:23,590
-It's been three years...
-It's been a long time.

578
01:03:29,179 --> 01:03:31,347
-What are you doing?
-I'm sorry.

579
01:04:44,171 --> 01:04:46,173
To not steal...

580
01:04:46,757 --> 01:04:48,467
To not steal...

581
01:04:48,842 --> 01:04:50,343
To not commit adultery...

582
01:04:50,719 --> 01:04:52,387
To not commit adultery...

583
01:04:53,347 --> 01:04:55,307
To not lie...

584
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:57,684
To not lie...

585
01:06:34,198 --> 01:06:38,698
Spider thread pulled into strings

586
01:06:39,703 --> 01:06:43,998
Strumming makes a zither sing

587
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:47,419
Thousand woes

588
01:06:54,468 --> 01:06:58,968
Under the blue sky
Only the crows cry

589
01:07:02,059 --> 01:07:06,559
How sorrowful my zither

590
01:07:07,105 --> 01:07:10,691
My beloved zither...

591
01:07:21,161 --> 01:07:23,121
Did you sleep well?

592
01:07:33,465 --> 01:07:34,466
Excuse me.

593
01:07:35,133 --> 01:07:36,634
Sorry.

594
01:07:41,431 --> 01:07:45,931
The Count paid the innkeeper
to spy on us, afraid we might run off.

595
01:07:46,895 --> 01:07:49,898
Why get dressed?
I've nothing to do anyway.

596
01:07:52,276 --> 01:07:54,069
Things are moving too slowly.

597
01:07:54,152 --> 01:07:57,613
I fear Hideko might truly go mad.

598
01:07:58,407 --> 01:08:00,367
Shall we play "maid", like before?

599
01:08:04,037 --> 01:08:07,582
There is no sign of the Count
from morning to night.

600
01:08:08,333 --> 01:08:12,337
Certifying the marriage
and converting the inheritance to cash

601
01:08:12,421 --> 01:08:13,755
require much work, he says.

602
01:08:53,045 --> 01:08:54,880
How could you be so cruel?

603
01:08:54,963 --> 01:08:58,299
You plucked the flower, now re-plant it.

604
01:08:58,383 --> 01:08:59,842
What do you want?

605
01:09:00,510 --> 01:09:03,721
Hurry up and throw her into the madhouse!

606
01:09:38,215 --> 01:09:39,841
After a week,

607
01:09:50,227 --> 01:09:51,519
finally...

608
01:10:38,859 --> 01:10:39,693
This way.

609
01:10:46,491 --> 01:10:47,867
They're from the madhouse.

610
01:10:47,951 --> 01:10:49,160
You know what to say.

611
01:11:04,217 --> 01:11:05,593
Who is that person?

612
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:08,138
The Countess Lady Fujiwara.

613
01:11:08,221 --> 01:11:10,973
Her maiden name was lzumi Hideko.

614
01:11:12,768 --> 01:11:14,644
And who might you be?

615
01:11:14,728 --> 01:11:16,438
I am the Lady's handmaiden.

616
01:11:16,855 --> 01:11:18,690
-What's your name?
-It's Tamako.

617
01:11:20,192 --> 01:11:22,903
Then, what kind of treatment

618
01:11:23,653 --> 01:11:26,322
do you believe your Lady requires?

619
01:11:40,754 --> 01:11:44,132
She should be confined in a place

620
01:11:44,216 --> 01:11:48,716
where no one can harm her
and where she can do no harm.

621
01:11:54,684 --> 01:11:59,184
Just a few tests, then let's have
lamb chops at the Peace Hotel.

622
01:12:16,039 --> 01:12:17,999
It's almost over. Good work.

623
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:21,878
Don't be frightened.

624
01:12:57,497 --> 01:12:59,582
Good day, Countess.

625
01:13:00,333 --> 01:13:01,917
Do you remember me?

626
01:13:05,463 --> 01:13:06,297
Countess?

627
01:13:15,974 --> 01:13:17,350
What is this?

628
01:13:17,434 --> 01:13:20,353
We mean you no harm, Countess.

629
01:13:20,854 --> 01:13:22,438
We're going to look after you.

630
01:13:23,857 --> 01:13:27,527
You've got the wrong person.
She is the Countess.

631
01:13:28,445 --> 01:13:30,321
Tell them, Your Lordship!

632
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:35,827
She still believes
she's a Korean handmaiden.

633
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:41,040
It's because her nanny was Korean.

634
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:42,917
You scoundrel!

635
01:13:44,878 --> 01:13:46,880
Let go of me, you filthy bitches!

636
01:13:46,963 --> 01:13:50,591
We do not use such language here,
your Ladyship.

637
01:13:50,675 --> 01:13:51,967
Miss!

638
01:13:56,473 --> 01:14:00,894
My poor Lady, she's gone nuts.

639
01:14:01,853 --> 01:14:04,188
If it would be of any help,

640
01:14:04,272 --> 01:14:08,772
this is from her mother
and she used to cherish it

641
01:14:10,487 --> 01:14:12,363
before going mad.

642
01:14:16,826 --> 01:14:19,119
Such a considerate maid.

643
01:14:21,623 --> 01:14:24,959
You may have thought that
Hideko was a fool.

644
01:14:26,086 --> 01:14:27,295
A fool... maybe not.

645
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:32,592
I tell you, right from the start
Miss Izumi Hideko...

646
01:14:35,595 --> 01:14:37,471
had always been...

647
01:14:37,889 --> 01:14:38,973
Miss!

648
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:41,726
...a rotten bitch.

649
01:14:47,107 --> 01:14:47,941
PART TWO

650
01:14:48,024 --> 01:14:52,524
I'm not a rotten bitch!
No! No!

651
01:15:00,537 --> 01:15:02,372
Put it in your mouth, Hideko.

652
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:06,959
Hold out your hand.

653
01:15:26,062 --> 01:15:29,023
Next time you feel like talking back,

654
01:15:29,482 --> 01:15:32,776
remember the taste of this metal bead.

655
01:15:38,992 --> 01:15:41,744
You'll sleep alone from tonight.

656
01:15:52,255 --> 01:15:54,590
- All right?
- Please give me a light.

657
01:15:54,966 --> 01:15:58,177
We've been ordered to save oil.

658
01:15:58,762 --> 01:16:00,430
You little brat.

659
01:16:00,513 --> 01:16:01,931
Speak Japanese!

660
01:16:04,809 --> 01:16:08,562
In there is a man the size of an ogre

661
01:16:08,646 --> 01:16:12,775
who can't stand
the sound of girls screaming.

662
01:16:13,401 --> 01:16:16,946
If he hears you, he'll burst
in through that door after you.

663
01:16:18,198 --> 01:16:19,324
And then?

664
01:16:23,161 --> 01:16:27,415
He'll smother you with his giant body,

665
01:16:27,832 --> 01:16:30,167
SO you can't make a sound.

666
01:16:44,516 --> 01:16:45,600
Aunt.

667
01:16:46,267 --> 01:16:47,977
My, my.

668
01:16:49,521 --> 01:16:52,232
Scaring a little girl like that.

669
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:43,532
And me?

670
01:17:45,243 --> 01:17:46,869
Am I pretty too?

671
01:17:50,874 --> 01:17:52,292
Look closely.

672
01:17:57,422 --> 01:17:59,507
Everyone says I can't compare

673
01:18:00,008 --> 01:18:04,137
to my big sister.

674
01:18:06,848 --> 01:18:07,682
Day.

675
01:18:08,308 --> 01:18:09,142
Night.

676
01:18:09,726 --> 01:18:10,560
Day.

677
01:18:11,311 --> 01:18:12,145
Night.

678
01:18:13,188 --> 01:18:14,314
Man.

679
01:18:14,731 --> 01:18:15,773
Woman.

680
01:18:16,608 --> 01:18:17,775
Man.

681
01:18:18,443 --> 01:18:19,360
Woman.

682
01:18:22,739 --> 01:18:23,573
Eye.

683
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:25,241
Nose.

684
01:18:26,075 --> 01:18:27,159
Mouth.

685
01:18:27,911 --> 01:18:28,786
Ear.

686
01:18:29,871 --> 01:18:30,788
Shoulder.

687
01:18:31,623 --> 01:18:32,665
Nipple.

688
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:34,209
Navel.

689
01:18:35,001 --> 01:18:35,835
Eye.

690
01:18:36,294 --> 01:18:37,420
Nose.

691
01:18:37,921 --> 01:18:38,963
Mouth.

692
01:18:39,631 --> 01:18:40,632
Ear.

693
01:18:41,049 --> 01:18:42,550
Shoulder.

694
01:18:42,634 --> 01:18:43,676
Nipple.

695
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:45,302
Navel.

696
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:49,891
Penis.

697
01:18:50,350 --> 01:18:51,642
Vagina.

698
01:18:57,565 --> 01:18:59,775
P... penis.

699
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:01,652
Vagina.

700
01:19:38,022 --> 01:19:41,233
Do you think I won't understand
if you speak Korean?

701
01:19:44,195 --> 01:19:48,695
I was going a bit crazy and wanted
everyone else to go crazy too.

702
01:19:53,288 --> 01:19:56,499
When Mrs. Sasaki
looked as crazy as I,

703
01:19:56,582 --> 01:19:58,834
life was more bearable.

704
01:20:17,228 --> 01:20:20,981
I know you are a bit insane.

705
01:20:21,774 --> 01:20:25,027
It runs in your mother's family.

706
01:20:26,070 --> 01:20:28,530
That's why I'm training you,

707
01:20:28,614 --> 01:20:29,823
to set your mind right.

708
01:20:30,325 --> 01:20:34,825
If I fail, there's a place called
a "mental hospital" in Japan.

709
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,711
Established by rational Germans,

710
01:20:41,794 --> 01:20:45,631
it's very effective in treating lunacy.

711
01:20:46,174 --> 01:20:49,927
They dig holes in the dirt,
put a patient in each one,

712
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:51,429
and put lids on top.

713
01:20:51,512 --> 01:20:54,056
When the patients get better,
they get a leash,

714
01:20:54,140 --> 01:20:57,977
so they can crawl around like dogs.

715
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:29,175
The cherry tree that came with me
on the ship from Japan

716
01:21:29,258 --> 01:21:30,926
bloomed twice.

717
01:21:32,595 --> 01:21:35,723
"When Jinlian finally took off
her clothes,

718
01:21:35,807 --> 01:21:39,018
Ximen-Qing-examined her-Jade-Gate...

719
01:21:39,102 --> 01:21:42,855
To-find-it-hairless-as-white-as-snow
and-as-smooth-as-jade..."

720
01:21:45,525 --> 01:21:47,443
You must pause between words.

721
01:21:48,653 --> 01:21:51,572
Don't read like a dog lapping
at his plate!

722
01:21:54,033 --> 01:21:56,869
Listen to your aunt read.

723
01:22:04,001 --> 01:22:08,501
"When Jinlian finally took off
her clothes,

724
01:22:08,756 --> 01:22:12,551
Ximen Qing examined her Jade Gate...

725
01:22:12,635 --> 01:22:14,053
DISCOVERING THE SECRET WELL

726
01:22:14,137 --> 01:22:18,224
...to find it hairless, as white as snow,

727
01:22:18,641 --> 01:22:20,768
and as smooth as jade.

728
01:22:21,227 --> 01:22:23,562
As tight as a drum,

729
01:22:24,063 --> 01:22:25,981
and as soft as silk.

730
01:22:27,150 --> 01:22:31,650
Once he drew apart the curtains of flesh,

731
01:22:33,156 --> 01:22:37,656
a scent of well-aged wine
emanated from within,

732
01:22:40,121 --> 01:22:44,621
and on fold upon fold
of the red velvet interior

733
01:22:45,585 --> 01:22:47,295
beads of dew were forming.

734
01:22:48,546 --> 01:22:53,046
Its center was dark and void,

735
01:22:54,427 --> 01:22:57,638
yet as if it had its own life,

736
01:22:58,222 --> 01:23:02,267
it twitched and twitched."

737
01:23:30,755 --> 01:23:34,967
Everyone wanted to cut it down,
but my uncle refused.

738
01:23:36,844 --> 01:23:41,344
He said this tree from Mt. Fuji
had absorbed my aunt's soul.

739
01:23:42,517 --> 01:23:47,017
The servants whispered it was
due to the tree's high cost,

740
01:23:48,189 --> 01:23:50,941
but I think my uncle was right.

741
01:23:51,692 --> 01:23:54,152
You can tell from the cherry blossoms,

742
01:23:54,612 --> 01:23:57,615
which turned brighter
and bloomed longer.

743
01:24:31,107 --> 01:24:33,317
"Tell me, Juliette.

744
01:24:33,693 --> 01:24:37,154
Do you wish for
this impetuous young knight to save you?

745
01:24:38,531 --> 01:24:40,699
The duchess shook her head resolutely,

746
01:24:46,372 --> 01:24:50,872
to my great disappointment.

747
01:24:55,881 --> 01:24:56,923
Now,

748
01:24:57,967 --> 01:25:00,052
my brave knight."

749
01:25:05,099 --> 01:25:07,142
Oh, it's a new face!

750
01:25:10,646 --> 01:25:11,980
Now,

751
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:13,940
my brave knight.

752
01:25:15,526 --> 01:25:20,026
When you see these old scars
and the fresh pink wounds,

753
01:25:22,074 --> 01:25:23,784
what do you feel?

754
01:25:27,330 --> 01:25:29,832
I pity the poor woman.

755
01:25:29,915 --> 01:25:34,415
I wish to lick her and lick her,
caress her and caress her.

756
01:25:36,088 --> 01:25:38,298
If you pity her so,

757
01:25:39,133 --> 01:25:43,387
why not take her place
and let her whip you?

758
01:25:50,436 --> 01:25:54,398
The duchess raised the whip
high in the air, and then...

759
01:26:02,448 --> 01:26:04,241
And again...

760
01:26:11,749 --> 01:26:14,877
My cock became painfully erect.

761
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:24,804
If she could be yours for ten minutes,

762
01:26:24,887 --> 01:26:26,722
what would you give in exchange?

763
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:30,726
Whatever your heart desires.

764
01:26:31,227 --> 01:26:33,979
Anything in this whole wide world.

765
01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:39,235
Once the duke untied me,

766
01:26:39,318 --> 01:26:42,821
I sat on the chair, pulled her to me,

767
01:26:43,614 --> 01:26:47,743
and slid my cock into her cunt.

768
01:26:53,416 --> 01:26:56,419
Oh, Juliette, Juliette...

769
01:26:58,754 --> 01:27:03,254
As I felt the duke approach from behind,

770
01:27:03,676 --> 01:27:06,387
a rope slithered around my neck.

771
01:27:07,930 --> 01:27:10,682
The duke slowly tightened the rope.

772
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:15,600
Like a drowning man grasping at straws,

773
01:27:15,896 --> 01:27:20,317
I pulled the swirling currents
of her hair.

774
01:27:21,485 --> 01:27:23,820
Then the duke spoke.

775
01:27:26,365 --> 01:27:28,950
The ten minutes are almost up.

776
01:27:39,128 --> 01:27:41,255
Slowly, my dear, said the Duchess...

777
01:27:41,714 --> 01:27:46,214
I haven't yet fully savored his pain.

778
01:27:54,435 --> 01:27:57,980
No, the knight cried, don't stop!

779
01:28:00,107 --> 01:28:03,360
Please let me die

780
01:28:03,444 --> 01:28:05,612
in the midst of this pain.

781
01:28:06,071 --> 01:28:08,531
In this suffocating pain.

782
01:28:52,159 --> 01:28:53,577
Is it Sade?

783
01:28:54,411 --> 01:28:56,079
It's Sade-esque.

784
01:28:56,622 --> 01:29:01,122
It is believed to be the same Japanese man
who wrote The Lizard Skin.

785
01:29:02,461 --> 01:29:06,961
It was acquired from a Japanese sailor
on a ship from Hamburg.

786
01:29:17,101 --> 01:29:20,395
Cheap hair and shabby clothes,

787
01:29:21,063 --> 01:29:23,482
old and worn down,

788
01:29:23,566 --> 01:29:26,986
a body foul with food waste
and human secretion.

789
01:29:28,904 --> 01:29:33,404
Can you imagine my joy when

790
01:29:34,702 --> 01:29:38,080
after such a journey,

791
01:29:38,581 --> 01:29:42,960
it sat on my shelf with its brothers?

792
01:29:43,043 --> 01:29:44,377
Even compared with an unopened

793
01:29:44,461 --> 01:29:47,672
first-edition of Milton's,
it wouldn't be outstripped.

794
01:29:49,592 --> 01:29:50,426
That's right.

795
01:29:51,176 --> 01:29:55,676
These are the babes
to whom I feel the most affection.

796
01:29:57,308 --> 01:30:01,808
It used to contain an elaborate
monochrome woodcut illustration,

797
01:30:05,566 --> 01:30:07,025
but as you can see...

798
01:30:07,109 --> 01:30:08,443
So unfortunate.

799
01:30:10,613 --> 01:30:14,783
If that were intact,
you could've named your price.

800
01:30:16,535 --> 01:30:20,914
The author felt words alone
could not fully describe the positions,

801
01:30:20,998 --> 01:30:24,710
and so included an illustration.

802
01:30:26,086 --> 01:30:29,339
In that regard,
before we start the bidding...

803
01:30:30,257 --> 01:30:31,132
Hideko!

804
01:30:31,634 --> 01:30:33,719
Why don't you show us this scene?

805
01:31:12,132 --> 01:31:15,135
PAIN IS A GARMENT

806
01:32:37,634 --> 01:32:39,010
Beautiful!

807
01:32:45,642 --> 01:32:47,769
See you again.

808
01:32:48,270 --> 01:32:50,522
Yes, thank you.

809
01:32:50,606 --> 01:32:53,442
Today's reading was outstanding.

810
01:32:54,109 --> 01:32:55,527
Yes, thank you.

811
01:32:56,236 --> 01:32:58,905
Especially the puppet!

812
01:33:27,184 --> 01:33:29,102
You are of noble birth,

813
01:33:29,186 --> 01:33:33,686
yet you engage in the lowly work
of copying paintings.

814
01:33:34,024 --> 01:33:37,277
There was a time

815
01:33:37,361 --> 01:33:40,364
when I dissipated my wit and skills
on gambling.

816
01:33:40,864 --> 01:33:44,325
Imagine the torment
of having so many women

817
01:33:44,409 --> 01:33:46,119
make advances on me,

818
01:33:46,203 --> 01:33:48,914
when I couldn't afford
to buy them a glass of Burgundy.

819
01:33:50,666 --> 01:33:54,670
Do the women here make advances on you?

820
01:33:55,504 --> 01:33:57,422
I look at women's eyes,

821
01:33:57,506 --> 01:33:58,673
only the eyes.

822
01:33:59,508 --> 01:34:03,136
They turn their gaze away,

823
01:34:03,220 --> 01:34:05,722
but then they always look back.

824
01:34:06,098 --> 01:34:08,934
It's a silent exchange
of question and answer.

825
01:34:09,893 --> 01:34:14,393
If I were to slide
under someone's covers tonight,

826
01:34:14,940 --> 01:34:19,361
only one woman here would refuse me.

827
01:34:20,487 --> 01:34:22,238
Does that include Mrs. Sasaki?

828
01:34:23,323 --> 01:34:27,823
Is she not your former wife?

829
01:34:29,913 --> 01:34:32,749
You left her to marry a Japanese woman.

830
01:34:33,250 --> 01:34:36,753
But the servants tell me
you still share a bed with her.

831
01:34:39,256 --> 01:34:41,800
Can I ask you something?

832
01:34:44,970 --> 01:34:46,137
Of course.

833
01:34:47,556 --> 01:34:52,056
You went so far as to abandon your wife,
why this urge to become Japanese?

834
01:34:54,855 --> 01:34:56,565
Because Korea is ugly

835
01:34:57,024 --> 01:34:59,860
and Japan is beautiful.

836
01:35:01,028 --> 01:35:04,197
Some Japanese say Japan is ugly,

837
01:35:04,281 --> 01:35:05,782
and Korea is beautiful.

838
01:35:06,366 --> 01:35:08,785
Beauty is cruel by nature.

839
01:35:08,869 --> 01:35:12,873
Korea is soft, slow, dull,
and therefore hopeless.

840
01:35:14,208 --> 01:35:18,629
Let's talk about that one woman
who would deny you.

841
01:35:22,007 --> 01:35:25,927
Does it include Mrs. Sasaki?

842
01:35:26,011 --> 01:35:28,013
Mrs. Sasaki...

843
01:35:30,307 --> 01:35:31,891
If I gave her the right signal,

844
01:35:31,975 --> 01:35:36,354
she'd knock on my door
without her underwear.

845
01:35:44,029 --> 01:35:46,114
My thoughts exactly.

846
01:35:48,283 --> 01:35:49,659
Then who is it?

847
01:35:50,244 --> 01:35:52,412
The one who would deny you?

848
01:35:54,915 --> 01:35:57,834
I heard you own the highest quality

849
01:35:57,918 --> 01:36:01,546
antique bookmaking tools
of the East and West,

850
01:36:02,381 --> 01:36:03,715
but I don't see them here.

851
01:36:04,091 --> 01:36:06,343
I'll show them to you later.

852
01:36:07,803 --> 01:36:12,303
Who is the one person to refuse you?

853
01:36:16,311 --> 01:36:20,811
I met Hideko's eyes by chance,
but she didn't look away.

854
01:36:21,108 --> 01:36:24,402
Indeed it was I, who shifted my gaze.

855
01:36:24,486 --> 01:36:25,570
Hideko,

856
01:36:26,196 --> 01:36:30,696
Will she make an appearance
in your lewd dreams tonight?

857
01:36:33,745 --> 01:36:36,831
Even if honored with such a visit,

858
01:36:37,416 --> 01:36:39,793
I don't think I could consummate.

859
01:36:40,335 --> 01:36:44,255
I would happily regret it
the moment I begin

860
01:36:44,756 --> 01:36:48,050
because her body
would be as cold as a waterfowl.

861
01:36:53,348 --> 01:36:55,683
That is the result of long training.

862
01:36:57,477 --> 01:37:00,813
I heard you are engaged to her.

863
01:37:04,985 --> 01:37:09,485
If 'm not mistaken,
you are yet to have intercourse?

864
01:37:11,742 --> 01:37:14,453
Her eyes have no desire.

865
01:37:14,870 --> 01:37:17,414
It means her soul is dead inside.

866
01:37:19,374 --> 01:37:21,125
You should go easy on her training,

867
01:37:21,918 --> 01:37:25,296
unless you enjoy making love
to a corpse.

868
01:37:48,820 --> 01:37:50,279
Would you like a smoke?

869
01:37:58,955 --> 01:38:02,792
How did such a noble count

870
01:38:02,876 --> 01:38:07,046
fall into the grouty habit
of smoking cigarettes?

871
01:39:00,642 --> 01:39:04,270
This is my particular way
of possessing beauty.

872
01:39:05,897 --> 01:39:09,400
Hideko too must have received
painting lessons.

873
01:39:10,444 --> 01:39:12,112
No, she did not.

874
01:39:12,737 --> 01:39:17,032
I was too occupied teaching her
to read with correct diction.

875
01:39:18,285 --> 01:39:19,286
Is that so?

876
01:39:19,786 --> 01:39:21,954
In England, where I studied,

877
01:39:22,038 --> 01:39:26,538
all ladies were expected to produce
vibrant color and graceful lines,

878
01:39:29,254 --> 01:39:31,297
even in the less noble families.

879
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:52,527
You have a phone call, sir.

880
01:39:53,403 --> 01:39:55,196
At this hour?

881
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:56,948
It's the Iwamura Bookstore.

882
01:39:57,949 --> 01:39:59,283
Is that so?

883
01:39:59,367 --> 01:40:01,327
Excuse me a moment.

884
01:40:11,379 --> 01:40:12,922
You are mesmerizing.

885
01:40:14,841 --> 01:40:17,635
Men use the word "mesmerizing"

886
01:40:17,719 --> 01:40:20,680
when they wish to touch a lady's breasts.

887
01:40:21,640 --> 01:40:25,226
I'm familiar
with Western conversational etiquette.

888
01:40:27,437 --> 01:40:30,273
I do a bit of reading, you know.

889
01:40:30,982 --> 01:40:32,900
There was no calculation in what I said.

890
01:40:33,485 --> 01:40:37,906
It was a reflex,
like pulling one's hand from a flame.

891
01:40:39,324 --> 01:40:40,366
I'm no flame.

892
01:40:41,117 --> 01:40:44,620
I'm cold as a waterfowl, your Lordship.

893
01:40:50,502 --> 01:40:52,670
He will return soon.

894
01:40:52,754 --> 01:40:55,339
Mr. Iwamura only called
with a frivolous inquiry,

895
01:40:55,423 --> 01:40:57,466
at my request.

896
01:40:57,551 --> 01:41:01,179
There's an issue regarding
your future you should know.

897
01:41:01,263 --> 01:41:04,474
I'll wait by the stone lamp at midnight.

898
01:41:06,268 --> 01:41:09,396
That Iwamura is a real fool.

899
01:41:15,569 --> 01:41:17,404
Good night, Miss.

900
01:42:28,808 --> 01:42:30,935
My maid is asleep in the room next door.

901
01:42:31,019 --> 01:42:33,312
I don't fancy being
in scandalous rumors with you.

902
01:42:33,396 --> 01:42:36,941
I saw Junko go to the servants' quarters
with her pillow.

903
01:42:37,025 --> 01:42:39,152
Consider your reputation as a nobleman.

904
01:42:39,778 --> 01:42:41,571
I'm no nobleman.

905
01:42:41,655 --> 01:42:43,448
I'm not even Japanese.

906
01:42:43,531 --> 01:42:46,116
Do you think it was easy for
a Korean farmhand's son to reach here?

907
01:42:47,243 --> 01:42:50,746
After fifteen hard years in Japan,
I heard some things about you.

908
01:42:51,247 --> 01:42:53,123
Another three years were spent to prepare.

909
01:42:53,792 --> 01:42:56,669
I studied bookmaking
and learned to paint forgeries.

910
01:42:57,504 --> 01:42:59,547
All so that I could meet you.

911
01:42:59,923 --> 01:43:01,466
To seduce and marry you,

912
01:43:01,549 --> 01:43:04,051
to possess your father's inheritance,

913
01:43:04,678 --> 01:43:06,304
and then probably to get rid of you.

914
01:43:08,431 --> 01:43:09,932
But I knew as soon as I met you.

915
01:43:10,517 --> 01:43:12,352
For a man to seduce you would be--

916
01:43:14,896 --> 01:43:15,980
...impossible.

917
01:43:17,774 --> 01:43:21,110
So in place of seduction,
I decided to propose a deal.

918
01:43:22,529 --> 01:43:26,074
Most marriages are like being imprisoned,
but this one will free you.

919
01:43:26,908 --> 01:43:28,743
I'll rescue you from here,

920
01:43:28,827 --> 01:43:32,288
take you far away, and give you freedom.

921
01:43:33,790 --> 01:43:35,958
Of course, we'll split the money.

922
01:43:37,168 --> 01:43:38,544
Nonsense.

923
01:43:39,587 --> 01:43:42,506
Does marrying an old man
with a black tongue

924
01:43:42,924 --> 01:43:44,050
at your tender age makes sense?

925
01:43:44,134 --> 01:43:46,261
I won't marry anyone.

926
01:43:46,344 --> 01:43:47,678
What have you in mind?

927
01:43:53,643 --> 01:43:55,102
That's not proper.

928
01:43:55,645 --> 01:43:56,812
There's no beauty in that.

929
01:43:57,439 --> 01:43:59,691
If you kill yourself,
what of your fortune?

930
01:44:00,442 --> 01:44:04,612
That will be the sum of your efforts?
Your fortune going to that pervert?

931
01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:08,574
So he can buy 10 little girls
and teach them to read books?

932
01:44:10,660 --> 01:44:12,870
My uncle will find us somehow.

933
01:44:13,288 --> 01:44:14,706
Then he'll take us to the basement.

934
01:44:15,832 --> 01:44:16,916
Uncle.

935
01:44:18,042 --> 01:44:18,959
The basement?

936
01:44:19,043 --> 01:44:22,337
It says here when people are hanged,

937
01:44:22,422 --> 01:44:26,922
their tongues stick out
and faeces is expelled.

938
01:44:28,303 --> 01:44:32,348
But that day, aunt's mouth was shut

939
01:44:33,141 --> 01:44:35,059
and her bottom was clean.

940
01:44:36,603 --> 01:44:38,688
Do you want to go somewhere nice?

941
01:44:56,456 --> 01:45:00,293
I'll tell you in detail
what I did to your aunt

942
01:45:00,376 --> 01:45:02,127
after I caught her running away.

943
01:45:02,754 --> 01:45:07,254
So don't you ever think of running,
understood?

944
01:45:25,401 --> 01:45:26,944
That day I just watched and listened.

945
01:45:27,695 --> 01:45:31,198
But if I ever end up there again...

946
01:45:35,995 --> 01:45:37,329
This is highly concentrated opium.

947
01:45:37,831 --> 01:45:39,666
Three drops will make you sleep all day.

948
01:45:40,083 --> 01:45:42,585
Five drops will knock down a horse.

949
01:45:43,127 --> 01:45:44,878
If you crave death within five minutes,

950
01:45:45,839 --> 01:45:47,674
drink it all.

951
01:45:47,757 --> 01:45:51,093
If you carry this,
he can never take you to the basement.

952
01:45:51,177 --> 01:45:52,261
At least not alive.

953
01:45:53,429 --> 01:45:55,013
It'll be my wedding gift to you.

954
01:45:55,682 --> 01:45:57,392
It's more expensive than jewels.

955
01:46:09,070 --> 01:46:13,570
Bring a girl to be my maid.
One who could disappear and not be missed.

956
01:46:14,450 --> 01:46:16,160
If a bit dense, all the better.

957
01:46:16,244 --> 01:46:20,331
We'll send her to a madhouse
under my name.

958
01:46:22,750 --> 01:46:24,668
They dig a hole in the ground,

959
01:46:24,752 --> 01:46:27,588
put a patient in there and close the lid.

960
01:46:28,506 --> 01:46:31,091
I want my name to be buried in that hole.

961
01:46:32,135 --> 01:46:34,637
I can find you a new maid,

962
01:46:34,721 --> 01:46:36,931
but what do we do about Junko?

963
01:46:42,312 --> 01:46:46,812
You really think
I'm prettier than Miss Hideko?

964
01:46:48,693 --> 01:46:52,780
Sure, Hideko's pretty, and you're pretty.

965
01:46:52,864 --> 01:46:54,574
What? You speak Korean?

966
01:46:56,242 --> 01:46:57,701
You know...

967
01:46:58,786 --> 01:46:59,620
I learned it.

968
01:47:00,538 --> 01:47:02,581
To speak more easily with you.

969
01:47:04,375 --> 01:47:06,835
I really wanted to say this to you.

970
01:47:08,546 --> 01:47:10,089
You are just mesmerizing.

971
01:47:10,173 --> 01:47:11,591
Oh my gosh!

972
01:47:13,551 --> 01:47:15,135
You little tart!

973
01:47:20,266 --> 01:47:22,309
I can't!

974
01:47:22,685 --> 01:47:25,479
If they catch me with a guest,
I'll be thrown out!

975
01:47:26,606 --> 01:47:30,985
Forget this wretched place.
Come live with me!

976
01:48:18,032 --> 01:48:19,158
Oh, fucking hell!

977
01:48:20,076 --> 01:48:21,160
Fucking hell?

978
01:48:21,244 --> 01:48:22,620
Fucking hell...

979
01:49:13,546 --> 01:49:16,215
The Count sent exactly what I ordered.

980
01:49:16,299 --> 01:49:18,509
Naive and a bit foolish.

981
01:49:22,346 --> 01:49:24,598
We're alike, somehow.

982
01:49:25,308 --> 01:49:26,684
I heard you're an orphan, too.

983
01:49:30,980 --> 01:49:32,231
Mother!

984
01:49:43,493 --> 01:49:47,993
Show Sookee your clothes
and jewellery at every opportunity.

985
01:49:48,706 --> 01:49:53,085
The material greed she got from her
mother will make her more gullible.

986
01:49:53,169 --> 01:49:57,669
P.S. Don't worry if she reads
this letter, she's totally illiterate.

987
01:49:59,258 --> 01:50:00,759
Would you read it to me?

988
01:50:01,177 --> 01:50:02,261
Pardon?

989
01:50:03,429 --> 01:50:07,433
"...looking for a maid.
Maids are like...

990
01:50:08,518 --> 01:50:10,019
a spoon... no...

991
01:50:12,105 --> 01:50:14,565
are like chopsticks..."

992
01:50:18,486 --> 01:50:20,446
Is it a spoon?

993
01:50:20,530 --> 01:50:21,405
COUNTESS FUJIWARA HIDEKO

994
01:50:21,489 --> 01:50:24,283
This is your name. Can't you read it?

995
01:50:29,831 --> 01:50:31,165
What's with your foot?

996
01:50:35,711 --> 01:50:36,545
Who did it?

997
01:50:37,338 --> 01:50:39,340
Who took Tamako's shoe?

998
01:50:46,722 --> 01:50:48,265
Apologize before all the servants!

999
01:50:52,228 --> 01:50:55,105
If she ever runs away
because of one of you,

1000
01:50:55,189 --> 01:50:57,065
I'll strip you all naked
and throw you out!

1001
01:50:58,860 --> 01:50:59,819
Fucking hell.

1002
01:51:04,699 --> 01:51:05,783
All smooth.

1003
01:51:12,999 --> 01:51:14,208
Do you like the scent?

1004
01:51:15,251 --> 01:51:16,877
Do you want to come in?

1005
01:51:16,961 --> 01:51:17,795
Pardon?

1006
01:51:38,357 --> 01:51:39,941
This must be Okju.

1007
01:51:40,026 --> 01:51:42,945
At your service, milord.

1008
01:51:43,863 --> 01:51:47,449
You know if you fail,
it'll put me in an awkward position.

1009
01:51:52,580 --> 01:51:56,208
A decent bone structure for a Korean...

1010
01:51:59,670 --> 01:52:04,091
So, are you carrying out
your duties faithfully?

1011
01:52:07,803 --> 01:52:10,555
-What?
-Thank you for introducing her.

1012
01:52:11,098 --> 01:52:15,598
You found the perfect maid for me.

1013
01:52:16,729 --> 01:52:20,399
It was tough looking for one
that wasn't chubby.

1014
01:52:21,192 --> 01:52:24,445
Take care of the lonely lady.

1015
01:52:25,112 --> 01:52:25,946
Here.

1016
01:52:28,991 --> 01:52:31,910
Becoming the lady's friend

1017
01:52:31,994 --> 01:52:33,870
and getting paid for it

1018
01:52:34,330 --> 01:52:35,748
is nothing to be ashamed of.

1019
01:52:38,417 --> 01:52:40,168
Isn't that right, Miss?

1020
01:52:42,296 --> 01:52:43,964
There's no need to be ashamed at all.

1021
01:52:44,048 --> 01:52:46,341
Your average fence
can barely tell them apart.

1022
01:52:46,425 --> 01:52:48,427
Is that so?

1023
01:52:53,975 --> 01:52:55,977
"I'm returning the earrings
you loaned me.

1024
01:52:56,560 --> 01:52:59,437
A woman might wager her fate
on such an exquisite pair.

1025
01:53:00,648 --> 01:53:03,317
I'm sure that
Sookee will try her very best

1026
01:53:03,401 --> 01:53:07,780
in order to see herself
wearing these in the mirror.

1027
01:53:08,614 --> 01:53:12,117
I'll tell you how to keep her
from getting suspicious.

1028
01:53:12,201 --> 01:53:15,329
Keep her busy
until the day of the wedding.

1029
01:53:15,830 --> 01:53:17,957
Make her spend all her energy

1030
01:53:18,040 --> 01:53:20,375
on making you fall in love with me."

1031
01:53:22,295 --> 01:53:25,631
In other words,
don't fall in love with me so easily.

1032
01:53:36,475 --> 01:53:37,309
Mesmerizing!

1033
01:53:40,688 --> 01:53:41,522
Me?

1034
01:53:50,698 --> 01:53:53,158
Dressed up, you look like a lady too.

1035
01:54:01,459 --> 01:54:03,127
Almost fully ripe.

1036
01:54:12,887 --> 01:54:15,306
How did your mother die?

1037
01:54:15,806 --> 01:54:19,184
That she was so lucky
to have you before dying.

1038
01:54:20,019 --> 01:54:22,062
That she had no regrets.

1039
01:54:23,481 --> 01:54:27,568
Is this the companionship
they write about in books?

1040
01:54:30,529 --> 01:54:31,571
I'll go pick mushrooms.

1041
01:54:31,655 --> 01:54:35,450
We'll have mushroom stew tonight,
you like that.

1042
01:54:35,534 --> 01:54:36,910
I'll go with you.

1043
01:54:37,870 --> 01:54:38,704
I'll be quick.

1044
01:54:38,788 --> 01:54:39,789
Before it rains.

1045
01:54:53,511 --> 01:54:55,763
What's with her?

1046
01:55:04,230 --> 01:55:05,773
Men are disgusting.

1047
01:55:06,273 --> 01:55:09,150
How can they be so single-minded?

1048
01:55:09,735 --> 01:55:10,902
What's on my mind?

1049
01:55:12,196 --> 01:55:15,449
You don't really believe
that I crave your body, do you?

1050
01:55:17,576 --> 01:55:18,702
You do!

1051
01:55:18,786 --> 01:55:20,412
You read too many of those books.

1052
01:55:20,496 --> 01:55:22,289
If there's one thing I'm after, Miss...

1053
01:55:23,541 --> 01:55:28,041
It's not your eyes, your hands or ass,

1054
01:55:28,921 --> 01:55:31,506
it's your money, only that.

1055
01:55:32,049 --> 01:55:34,092
Of all that you have, money is the best.

1056
01:55:36,429 --> 01:55:39,723
It feels great being so rude
to a noble lady.

1057
01:55:40,474 --> 01:55:42,058
What's with her?

1058
01:55:42,726 --> 01:55:46,563
Why does she stomp her feet,
expressing her anger,

1059
01:55:46,981 --> 01:55:49,441
sit up in the middle of the night
and sigh?

1060
01:55:51,235 --> 01:55:55,322
Every time she sees the Count,
her eyes seem to say,

1061
01:55:56,115 --> 01:55:57,366
I despise you.

1062
01:55:58,659 --> 01:56:00,160
Try to bear it.

1063
01:56:00,244 --> 01:56:03,455
Only if she sees this
will she believe the proposal.

1064
01:56:23,058 --> 01:56:27,103
Think of me as that puppet,
and I'll imagine another woman.

1065
01:56:27,563 --> 01:56:29,606
What woman?

1066
01:56:32,193 --> 01:56:33,611
The duchess Juliette.

1067
01:56:36,572 --> 01:56:38,240
Lady!

1068
01:56:38,991 --> 01:56:40,492
Milord!

1069
01:56:46,207 --> 01:56:47,541
Lady...

1070
01:56:52,963 --> 01:56:56,549
"The lady's emotions lay deep inside...

1071
01:56:57,176 --> 01:56:59,678
Jinlian could not fathom their depths.

1072
01:57:01,722 --> 01:57:03,807
Knowing this, Lady Sun

1073
01:57:03,891 --> 01:57:08,020
gave Jinlian four small silver balls.

1074
01:57:08,103 --> 01:57:12,603
These are 'minting',
or 'bells of passion'.

1075
01:57:12,691 --> 01:57:16,069
Place two in the lady's Jade Gate,

1076
01:57:16,487 --> 01:57:19,698
and the other two in yours.

1077
01:57:22,201 --> 01:57:24,203
Spread your legs apart

1078
01:57:24,286 --> 01:57:26,788
and like two scissors

1079
01:57:26,872 --> 01:57:28,999
trying to cut each other,
put them together.

1080
01:57:29,375 --> 01:57:32,169
When the lips below rub
against each another,

1081
01:57:32,253 --> 01:57:34,296
you'll hear a clear ringing sound.”

1082
01:57:34,380 --> 01:57:36,507
A blackout! Bring a lantern!

1083
01:57:36,590 --> 01:57:38,133
Yes, sir!

1084
01:57:38,217 --> 01:57:41,345
THE SOUND OF BELLS
ON A WINDLESS NIGHT

1085
01:57:43,180 --> 01:57:47,392
"When do I put this in?'
asked Jinlian.

1086
01:57:48,227 --> 01:57:52,689
Does the lady breathe deeply
and swallow hard?

1087
01:57:54,108 --> 01:57:57,236
Does she whisper sweetly in your ear,

1088
01:57:57,319 --> 01:57:59,195
and kiss you?

1089
01:58:04,159 --> 01:58:06,244
Does she embrace you tightly

1090
01:58:06,328 --> 01:58:08,246
and caress your nipples?

1091
01:58:10,666 --> 01:58:15,166
Does her secret part become slippery

1092
01:58:16,505 --> 01:58:21,005
as she gently bites your shoulder?

1093
01:58:24,638 --> 01:58:27,849
Then, put in the bells.”

1094
01:58:32,605 --> 01:58:34,982
-Amazing!
-Indeed!

1095
01:58:54,251 --> 01:58:56,086
It's so cute.

1096
01:59:01,884 --> 01:59:03,468
If the Count sees this...

1097
01:59:10,893 --> 01:59:13,270
Will he really be as tender as this?

1098
01:59:14,772 --> 01:59:16,023
Of course.

1099
01:59:16,106 --> 01:59:19,025
And he'll touch you like this...

1100
01:59:20,027 --> 01:59:21,153
And like this...

1101
01:59:29,912 --> 01:59:31,705
Tamako, keep doing

1102
01:59:32,790 --> 01:59:34,416
what the Count will.

1103
01:59:37,169 --> 01:59:38,336
The Count...

1104
01:59:38,837 --> 01:59:40,630
The Count...

1105
01:59:40,714 --> 01:59:43,299
He'll go crazy over this.

1106
01:59:45,636 --> 01:59:49,097
And this is what he'll say.

1107
01:59:51,350 --> 01:59:55,850
“It's so soft, warm, wet, and...

1108
02:00:01,110 --> 02:00:05,239
S... S... spellbindingly beautiful!”

1109
02:00:37,146 --> 02:00:40,065
Shall I teach you more, Miss?

1110
02:00:40,149 --> 02:00:42,526
Yes...

1111
02:00:43,110 --> 02:00:44,569
Teach me everything.

1112
02:01:29,531 --> 02:01:33,868
I wish that I had breast milk
so I could feed you.

1113
02:01:48,842 --> 02:01:50,593
Do you like it when I do this?

1114
02:01:52,262 --> 02:01:53,596
Do you like me?

1115
02:01:55,516 --> 02:01:58,268
Can you promise that you won't betray me?

1116
02:01:59,937 --> 02:02:01,855
I'll never...

1117
02:02:01,939 --> 02:02:02,856
never...

1118
02:02:04,233 --> 02:02:05,234
ever...

1119
02:02:19,748 --> 02:02:24,248
Miss, how could such an innocent...

1120
02:02:26,171 --> 02:02:27,881
You must be a natural.

1121
02:03:24,021 --> 02:03:24,855
Stop!

1122
02:03:27,482 --> 02:03:30,151
I spit it out without chewing!
All because of you!

1123
02:03:30,986 --> 02:03:32,654
She's got no one on this earth.

1124
02:03:32,738 --> 02:03:36,074
If you frighten her,
she'll close up hard as a clam.

1125
02:03:36,158 --> 02:03:37,701
And please...

1126
02:03:38,160 --> 02:03:42,660
Don't ever again put my hand
on your tiny joke of a cock.

1127
02:03:50,213 --> 02:03:51,214
You see?

1128
02:03:52,841 --> 02:03:55,510
If you don't give the impression
you want this marriage,

1129
02:03:55,594 --> 02:03:58,847
she may throw another fit
and refuse to go forward.

1130
02:03:58,931 --> 02:04:02,059
Be more convincing
when you pretend to love me.

1131
02:04:02,142 --> 02:04:03,226
I can't do it.

1132
02:04:03,602 --> 02:04:04,436
What?

1133
02:04:05,187 --> 02:04:06,521
I want to quit.

1134
02:04:08,690 --> 02:04:09,857
What's with you all today?

1135
02:04:11,568 --> 02:04:12,485
Why?

1136
02:04:13,612 --> 02:04:15,614
I hate everyone.
My mom, dad, aunt, uncle,

1137
02:04:15,697 --> 02:04:16,948
you and...

1138
02:04:22,829 --> 02:04:24,330
I don't like Sookee, either.

1139
02:04:24,414 --> 02:04:25,998
You feel sorry for her?

1140
02:04:29,378 --> 02:04:31,380
What is it with women?

1141
02:04:34,591 --> 02:04:38,177
You know what that poor Sookee said
about your Ladyship?

1142
02:04:38,762 --> 02:04:42,348
That you're too naive to get it
even if someone pulls on your nipples.

1143
02:04:42,432 --> 02:04:45,351
That she was nice out of pity,
but you ate it up.

1144
02:04:45,435 --> 02:04:47,145
That you were so gullible!

1145
02:04:47,229 --> 02:04:50,857
That naive servant's face...

1146
02:04:50,941 --> 02:04:53,276
Yes... you will love him.

1147
02:04:53,360 --> 02:04:56,404
If I say that I love someone else...

1148
02:04:57,823 --> 02:05:02,160
I have no one on this earth...

1149
02:05:02,744 --> 02:05:05,163
Would you still want me to marry him?

1150
02:05:05,580 --> 02:05:06,414
Yes.

1151
02:05:18,218 --> 02:05:19,135
Miss!

1152
02:05:41,908 --> 02:05:44,410
I wish I'd never been born.

1153
02:06:16,735 --> 02:06:19,946
I wish I'd never been born.

1154
02:06:39,883 --> 02:06:40,884
Let go.

1155
02:06:43,637 --> 02:06:46,681
Miss, I'm sorry!

1156
02:06:49,309 --> 02:06:50,143
Let go!

1157
02:06:50,811 --> 02:06:52,729
I'm sorry, Miss!

1158
02:06:53,105 --> 02:06:54,606
Don't die.

1159
02:06:54,689 --> 02:06:56,899
I'm sorry.

1160
02:06:58,860 --> 02:07:00,194
What are you sorry about?

1161
02:07:02,197 --> 02:07:06,697
I tried to trick you
into marrying that bastard.

1162
02:07:06,868 --> 02:07:09,912
I was going to put you
in a madhouse and run off.

1163
02:07:11,331 --> 02:07:15,251
Don't die. Don't get married, Miss!

1164
02:07:17,546 --> 02:07:21,007
Sookee, are you worried about me?

1165
02:07:26,638 --> 02:07:28,264
I'm worried about you.

1166
02:07:33,728 --> 02:07:36,397
How do you know my name?

1167
02:07:37,858 --> 02:07:39,985
You think you're tricking me?

1168
02:07:42,612 --> 02:07:43,988
You're the one being tricked.

1169
02:07:45,657 --> 02:07:47,867
You're the one bound for the madhouse.

1170
02:07:50,078 --> 02:07:52,538
I was going to lock you up
in there under my name,

1171
02:07:53,290 --> 02:07:56,167
then I'd become you
and run far away with him.

1172
02:08:01,256 --> 02:08:04,717
I won't say sorry,
since you tried to trick me too.

1173
02:08:12,017 --> 02:08:14,519
That fucking son of a bitch!

1174
02:08:16,980 --> 02:08:19,983
Oh, sorry Miss!

1175
02:08:20,901 --> 02:08:25,155
"I hope this letter finds you well.
This is Sookee.

1176
02:08:25,614 --> 02:08:30,076
I'm writing to inform you
of a change in plans.

1177
02:08:30,160 --> 02:08:34,660
I decided to team up
with the Lady Hideko.

1178
02:08:35,457 --> 02:08:38,751
As such, I'm now in need
of all your help.

1179
02:08:38,835 --> 02:08:41,838
I'm enclosing an item
as advance payment.”

1180
02:08:41,922 --> 02:08:46,301
Always remember the basement.

1181
02:09:00,649 --> 02:09:02,609
Do you want to go somewhere nice?

1182
02:09:46,528 --> 02:09:48,821
You didn't teach me to read Japanese.

1183
02:10:11,386 --> 02:10:13,346
Did that bastard draw this?

1184
02:10:15,849 --> 02:10:20,349
Is this what you've been reading
to that dirty old man

1185
02:10:21,313 --> 02:10:22,689
and those gentlemen?

1186
02:12:29,399 --> 02:12:32,568
The daughter of a legendary thief,

1187
02:12:32,652 --> 02:12:34,862
who sewed winter coats
out of stolen purses,

1188
02:12:34,946 --> 02:12:38,115
who was a thief, pickpocket
and swindler.

1189
02:12:39,284 --> 02:12:41,786
She is the savior who came
to tear my life apart.

1190
02:12:42,412 --> 02:12:43,913
My Tamako.

1191
02:12:44,789 --> 02:12:45,790
My Sookee.

1192
02:14:07,413 --> 02:14:09,331
How cruel can you be?

1193
02:14:09,415 --> 02:14:12,668
You plucked the flower, now re-plant it.

1194
02:14:12,752 --> 02:14:14,754
What do you want?

1195
02:14:14,837 --> 02:14:17,965
Hurry up and throw her
into the madhouse!

1196
02:14:23,429 --> 02:14:24,930
You scoundrel!

1197
02:14:25,431 --> 02:14:27,683
Let go of me, you filthy bitches!

1198
02:14:29,227 --> 02:14:30,645
Miss!

1199
02:14:31,145 --> 02:14:32,646
Let go!

1200
02:14:34,399 --> 02:14:35,775
Miss!

1201
02:14:50,915 --> 02:14:51,916
I'm hungry.

1202
02:14:56,588 --> 02:15:01,088
The first month,
I ordered a slim herringbone suit.

1203
02:15:01,843 --> 02:15:04,887
The next month,
I wore it to dine at the Imperial Hotel.

1204
02:15:04,971 --> 02:15:05,805
PART THREE

1205
02:15:05,888 --> 02:15:08,807
Me, a colonial boy working
as a tout at a brothel.

1206
02:15:08,891 --> 02:15:11,977
Some Englishmen who frequented the brothel
recognized me.

1207
02:15:12,061 --> 02:15:15,647
I thought they'd call the maitre d'
and kick me out,

1208
02:15:16,399 --> 02:15:17,441
but what do you know?

1209
02:15:18,401 --> 02:15:22,780
They were amused I'd spend a month's pay

1210
02:15:22,864 --> 02:15:24,323
on one dignified meal.

1211
02:15:25,450 --> 02:15:27,743
They started calling me "Count”

1212
02:15:27,827 --> 02:15:29,662
and taught me manners
to go with the name.

1213
02:15:29,746 --> 02:15:31,748
Frankly, I'm not that
interested in money itself.

1214
02:15:32,332 --> 02:15:34,584
What I desire is, how shall I put it...

1215
02:15:35,752 --> 02:15:38,254
The manner of ordering wine
without looking at the price?

1216
02:15:38,713 --> 02:15:39,922
Something like that.

1217
02:15:51,934 --> 02:15:54,436
Fourteen hours by train from Vladivostok

1218
02:15:54,520 --> 02:15:56,522
is the summer home
of a genuine Russian noble family.

1219
02:15:56,606 --> 02:15:58,482
All the furniture is set

1220
02:15:58,566 --> 02:16:00,943
along with ankle-deep carpets.

1221
02:16:08,368 --> 02:16:09,702
Shall we marry there?

1222
02:16:15,166 --> 02:16:17,418
In a few days,
I'll hear from the hospital.

1223
02:16:19,337 --> 02:16:22,006
That my wife Fujiwara Hideko
has died.

1224
02:16:26,052 --> 02:16:28,679
You didn't just ask them to keep her?

1225
02:16:29,597 --> 02:16:32,891
I doubt Sookee would want
to live there very long.

1226
02:16:41,609 --> 02:16:42,651
Fuck!

1227
02:16:47,615 --> 02:16:49,241
Bastard.

1228
02:16:49,325 --> 02:16:52,745
I never said I wasn't a bastard.

1229
02:16:54,372 --> 02:16:58,626
You'll become a colonial girl
named Nam Sookee.

1230
02:16:58,710 --> 02:17:00,670
You know I'm an expert
at document forgery, right?

1231
02:17:00,753 --> 02:17:02,713
I arranged it with a photography studio.

1232
02:17:03,965 --> 02:17:07,718
From tomorrow,
we'll give Sookee a new life.

1233
02:17:07,802 --> 02:17:09,094
I'm glad.

1234
02:17:09,178 --> 02:17:10,846
Marry me once again.

1235
02:17:11,848 --> 02:17:13,432
This time as Nam Sookee.

1236
02:17:15,435 --> 02:17:17,353
You want another wedding night?

1237
02:17:23,776 --> 02:17:26,904
I think I slightly like you.

1238
02:17:30,408 --> 02:17:32,660
Poor Sookee, in a place like that

1239
02:17:33,953 --> 02:17:35,788
all by herself...

1240
02:17:37,999 --> 02:17:41,085
Did such a thought ever cross your mind?

1241
02:17:41,544 --> 02:17:43,671
Not at all. Why should I pity her?

1242
02:17:44,172 --> 02:17:46,716
Where I come from,
it's illegal to be naive.

1243
02:17:47,467 --> 02:17:50,970
Where you come from, it's not naive
to fall in love with a business partner?

1244
02:17:51,053 --> 02:17:53,138
Of course. It's illegal.

1245
02:17:53,639 --> 02:17:56,975
So even if my love for you
leads me to ruin,

1246
02:17:57,560 --> 02:17:58,978
don't pity me.

1247
02:17:59,771 --> 02:18:00,605
Love?

1248
02:18:02,899 --> 02:18:04,692
What does a crook know about love?

1249
02:18:27,548 --> 02:18:30,092
Fire!

1250
02:18:39,685 --> 02:18:42,020
C... c... come this way!

1251
02:18:42,104 --> 02:18:44,481
This way!

1252
02:19:53,759 --> 02:19:56,595
Because you desired me,

1253
02:19:56,679 --> 02:19:58,931
and overcame all obstacles to reach me,

1254
02:19:59,015 --> 02:20:00,975
I have been born anew, it's true.

1255
02:20:02,560 --> 02:20:04,228
I'm grateful for that.

1256
02:20:06,606 --> 02:20:08,482
I'll allow a kiss.

1257
02:20:13,571 --> 02:20:14,405
No.

1258
02:20:14,822 --> 02:20:15,656
Why not?

1259
02:20:19,035 --> 02:20:21,078
I don't like kisses with conditions.

1260
02:20:21,162 --> 02:20:23,789
I never learned how to stop halfway.

1261
02:20:26,042 --> 02:20:30,542
After this I'll thrust in deep,
to your navel.

1262
02:20:32,465 --> 02:20:33,966
Please do that.

1263
02:20:37,678 --> 02:20:39,221
Those aren't the eyes of one who wants it.

1264
02:20:39,805 --> 02:20:42,432
You know you can't deceive me
in such matters.

1265
02:20:47,605 --> 02:20:51,692
If I could be yours for ten minutes,

1266
02:20:51,776 --> 02:20:53,027
what would you give in exchange?

1267
02:20:54,403 --> 02:20:56,696
Whatever your heart desires.

1268
02:20:56,781 --> 02:20:59,074
Anything in this whole wide world.

1269
02:21:23,933 --> 02:21:25,559
There's much I want to teach you.

1270
02:21:27,561 --> 02:21:30,313
You'll become a completely new woman.

1271
02:23:21,926 --> 02:23:24,845
It won't hurt.
You've seen it in those books.

1272
02:23:24,929 --> 02:23:28,766
In truth, women feel the greatest pleasure

1273
02:23:28,849 --> 02:23:30,517
when taken by force.

1274
02:23:31,060 --> 02:23:33,854
Now I'm going to rip your underwear.

1275
02:25:51,951 --> 02:25:54,078
Would you fetch those for me?

1276
02:26:04,088 --> 02:26:07,007
Okay, here we go.

1277
02:26:07,091 --> 02:26:09,009
One, two, three.

1278
02:26:50,509 --> 02:26:52,469
Respected Uncle,

1279
02:26:53,554 --> 02:26:55,389
it always pained me

1280
02:26:55,848 --> 02:26:58,559
to see you straining
to speak flawless Japanese

1281
02:26:58,642 --> 02:27:03,142
before the Count from Nagoya
and even to quiver your voice

1282
02:27:03,272 --> 02:27:06,358
like a nobleman.

1283
02:27:08,694 --> 02:27:13,194
So I'm happy to inform you
that you no longer need do so.

1284
02:27:15,909 --> 02:27:20,409
That man is the son
of a Korean farmhand.

1285
02:27:21,540 --> 02:27:25,877
Oh, did my gift arrive safely?

1286
02:27:26,962 --> 02:27:30,590
Please tell this to my gift, in Korean.

1287
02:27:31,508 --> 02:27:33,259
I'm afraid that in real life,

1288
02:27:34,345 --> 02:27:37,639
no woman feels pleasure
at being taken by force.

1289
02:27:38,057 --> 02:27:42,557
But, for sending me Sookee
out of all the girls in the world,

1290
02:27:43,604 --> 02:27:45,731
I feel "slightly” grateful.

1291
02:27:59,328 --> 02:28:02,664
You wished to see my bookmaking tools?

1292
02:28:03,290 --> 02:28:06,584
Don't just look,
experience them for yourself.

1293
02:28:07,586 --> 02:28:09,379
I'll choose five books that I cherish...

1294
02:28:10,089 --> 02:28:12,716
that I used to cherish more than anything.

1295
02:28:15,010 --> 02:28:17,178
Let's see... First,

1296
02:28:20,265 --> 02:28:22,350
Confessions of a Whip

1297
02:28:31,151 --> 02:28:32,443
The Lizard Skin

1298
02:28:44,957 --> 02:28:48,627
Decadent Girls Who Sell Lingerie

1299
02:28:57,970 --> 02:29:00,681
May I please smoke a cigarette, sir?

1300
02:29:01,765 --> 02:29:02,599
Sir.

1301
02:29:05,769 --> 02:29:06,978
Bells and Balls

1302
02:29:11,316 --> 02:29:12,942
The Mortician's Bedroom

1303
02:29:25,456 --> 02:29:28,083
How could you let a little girl fool you?

1304
02:29:31,462 --> 02:29:35,962
But don't worry.
I'll catch them for you soon.

1305
02:29:41,346 --> 02:29:44,098
I'll bind books with the skin
of those two bitches and you

1306
02:29:44,183 --> 02:29:48,228
and place them on the shelf.

1307
02:29:49,605 --> 02:29:54,105
I arranged so that no two girls
traveling together can leave Kobe.

1308
02:29:57,696 --> 02:29:59,864
Please change the destination to Shanghai.

1309
02:30:00,282 --> 02:30:03,368
Changing two tickets,
from Vladivostok to Shanghai.

1310
02:30:03,452 --> 02:30:05,203
Yes, that's correct.

1311
02:30:05,996 --> 02:30:06,955
Show me your passports.

1312
02:30:14,671 --> 02:30:16,130
Miss Nam Sookee?

1313
02:30:19,551 --> 02:30:20,760
Mr. Go Pan-dol?

1314
02:30:29,394 --> 02:30:31,854
You need to pay an additional 3 yen.

1315
02:30:32,481 --> 02:30:33,315
All right.

1316
02:30:37,986 --> 02:30:42,486
Hideko is a peach
that I left on the branch,

1317
02:30:43,742 --> 02:30:46,161
imagining what the taste will be like.

1318
02:30:46,954 --> 02:30:49,831
Would I have plucked it someday?

1319
02:30:50,499 --> 02:30:51,333
No.

1320
02:30:52,626 --> 02:30:57,005
I'm just an old man
who likes dirty stories.

1321
02:30:58,882 --> 02:31:02,010
Even listening to the same story,
people imagine different things.

1322
02:31:03,011 --> 02:31:06,014
Peering into each of those fantasies

1323
02:31:06,557 --> 02:31:09,518
was this old man's humble recreation.

1324
02:31:10,018 --> 02:31:13,104
What to do, now that it's all over?

1325
02:31:13,772 --> 02:31:16,149
You should at least tell me your story.

1326
02:31:17,985 --> 02:31:21,196
How did that bitch Hideko taste?

1327
02:31:22,281 --> 02:31:25,242
Was she fully ripe?
Tell me.

1328
02:31:28,245 --> 02:31:30,622
A cigarette might help my memory.

1329
02:31:31,790 --> 02:31:34,042
Right, right...

1330
02:31:34,835 --> 02:31:38,588
You have that silly penchant
for cigarettes?

1331
02:31:55,606 --> 02:31:59,318
So how was Hideko?

1332
02:32:05,616 --> 02:32:09,411
You have no windows here.

1333
02:32:13,165 --> 02:32:16,168
Sookee could be listening in.
Let's do our best.

1334
02:32:28,263 --> 02:32:29,514
That's it, good.

1335
02:32:42,027 --> 02:32:43,737
What's this?

1336
02:32:43,820 --> 02:32:46,197
You can't stop there, dear fellow.

1337
02:32:46,281 --> 02:32:48,616
So, where did you touch first?

1338
02:32:49,076 --> 02:32:49,910
Her face?

1339
02:32:52,704 --> 02:32:54,080
Her breasts?

1340
02:32:55,707 --> 02:32:57,709
Or straight for her
c... cunt?

1341
02:33:00,212 --> 02:33:01,630
Was it soft?

1342
02:33:02,506 --> 02:33:04,049
Did it tighten up?

1343
02:33:05,717 --> 02:33:07,552
Did it have many wrinkles?

1344
02:33:08,553 --> 02:33:10,721
Was it sufficiently wet?

1345
02:33:10,806 --> 02:33:14,309
How was the viscosity and transparency
of her vaginal secretion?

1346
02:33:15,769 --> 02:33:17,896
Please, one more cigarette, sir.

1347
02:33:44,881 --> 02:33:49,381
Spider thread pulled into strings...

1348
02:33:52,139 --> 02:33:55,892
I dare say no book
has ever described

1349
02:33:55,976 --> 02:33:58,979
such a ferocious wedding night.

1350
02:34:03,483 --> 02:34:07,111
I thought I heard a nightingale sing.

1351
02:34:41,938 --> 02:34:46,438
And the clear, bright crimson blood...

1352
02:34:56,077 --> 02:34:58,287
Thus the Lady became my wife.

1353
02:34:58,872 --> 02:35:02,834
Coy one moment, bold the next...

1354
02:35:06,505 --> 02:35:10,759
But how was she coy,

1355
02:35:11,343 --> 02:35:15,513
how was she bold,
tell it to me in detail!

1356
02:35:16,014 --> 02:35:19,392
A story is all about the journey.

1357
02:35:19,476 --> 02:35:21,186
You should know.

1358
02:35:23,313 --> 02:35:24,856
Did she resist?

1359
02:35:25,982 --> 02:35:28,359
So did you pinch her ass as punishment?

1360
02:35:28,819 --> 02:35:32,489
Or did she spit at you in contempt?

1361
02:35:33,615 --> 02:35:35,033
Or else...

1362
02:35:35,659 --> 02:35:37,827
Did she beg you to do it?

1363
02:35:38,870 --> 02:35:42,248
Like the lady in
The Widow's Lapdog ?

1364
02:35:45,794 --> 02:35:47,045
How dare you!

1365
02:35:47,462 --> 02:35:49,088
Hideko is my wife.

1366
02:35:49,673 --> 02:35:53,968
What kind of scoundrel rattles on
about his wedding night!

1367
02:37:30,231 --> 02:37:31,774
It's odd...

1368
02:37:33,193 --> 02:37:34,986
Your smoke.

1369
02:37:37,489 --> 02:37:40,909
It's cold, blue...

1370
02:37:42,369 --> 02:37:46,869
and strangely beautiful.

1371
02:37:49,584 --> 02:37:54,084
You too have become soft, slow and dull.

1372
02:37:57,968 --> 02:38:00,929
Mercury is most deadly
in its gaseous state.

1373
02:38:01,930 --> 02:38:03,765
One cigarette would have sufficed.

1374
02:38:07,978 --> 02:38:12,273
At least I will die with my cock intact.

1375
02:42:27,820 --> 02:42:32,320
THE HANDMAIDEN EXTENDED VERSION

1376
02:44:55,051 --> 02:44:59,263
I hear a sound in the distance

1377
02:44:59,347 --> 02:45:03,559
that sounds like the steps of my love

1378
02:45:03,643 --> 02:45:07,938
An echo that makes my heart

1379
02:45:08,022 --> 02:45:11,191
skip a beat

1380
02:45:12,276 --> 02:45:16,029
But I wait all through the night

1381
02:45:16,531 --> 02:45:20,451
and my love never comes to me

1382
02:45:20,827 --> 02:45:24,580
There is no end to the heartache

1383
02:45:25,081 --> 02:45:28,626
that grips me in this hour

1384
02:45:29,335 --> 02:45:33,130
Waiting for the footsteps of

1385
02:45:33,548 --> 02:45:36,717
my dear love

1386
02:45:37,969 --> 02:45:42,014
Waiting for the footsteps of

1387
02:45:42,098 --> 02:45:46,598
my dear love

1388
02:46:03,703 --> 02:46:07,748
But then in my waiting heart

1389
02:46:07,832 --> 02:46:12,169
suddenly happiness overflows

1390
02:46:12,253 --> 02:46:16,090
There you are in the distance

1391
02:46:16,507 --> 02:46:19,551
coming to me

1392
02:46:20,803 --> 02:46:25,015
Filled with dreams of a new life

1393
02:46:25,099 --> 02:46:29,311
filled with happiness

1394
02:46:29,395 --> 02:46:33,607
Inside my waiting heart

1395
02:46:33,691 --> 02:46:37,820
flowers start to bloom

1396
02:46:37,904 --> 02:46:41,741
Come my lover, come to me

1397
02:46:42,241 --> 02:46:45,452
I missed you so

1398
02:46:46,579 --> 02:46:50,749
Let's dream of happy times

1399
02:46:50,833 --> 02:46:55,212
like long ago

1400
02:47:12,271 --> 02:47:16,066
Filled with dreams of a new life

1401
02:47:16,567 --> 02:47:20,153
filled with happiness

1402
02:47:20,905 --> 02:47:25,034
Inside my waiting heart

1403
02:47:25,117 --> 02:47:28,662
flowers start to bloom

1404
02:47:29,413 --> 02:47:33,500
Waiting for the footsteps of

1405
02:47:33,584 --> 02:47:36,712
my dear love

1406
02:47:37,964 --> 02:47:41,717
Waiting for the footsteps of

1407
02:47:42,176 --> 02:47:46,305
my dear love
