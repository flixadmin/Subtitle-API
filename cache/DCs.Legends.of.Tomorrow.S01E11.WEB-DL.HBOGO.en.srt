1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,000
<i>In 2166, an immortal tyrant
named Vandal Savage</i>

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,520
<i>conquered the world
and murdered my wife and child.</i>

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,200
<i>I have assembled an elite team
to hunt him throughout time</i>

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,880
<i>and stop his rise to power.</i>

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,200
<i>Unfortunately, my plan
is opposed by the body</i>

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,240
<i>I'd sworn my allegiance to,
the Time Masters.</i>

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,360
<i>In the future, my friends
may not be heroes,</i>

8
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,160
<i>but if we succeed,</i>

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,080
<i>they will be remembered as legends.</i>

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,240
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

11
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,320
Sorry we're late.

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,600
Aren't you even a little bit happy
to be back on the ship?

13
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,760
I was happy with that life
we built together.

14
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,600
You think I was hunting you
and your friends

15
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,440
because the Time Masters made me?

16
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,120
They barely had to ask.

17
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,520
<i>Since I failed to bring you in,</i>

18
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,160
<i>the Time Masters want to bring me in.</i>

19
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,920
They're called the Hunters,
and they'll stop at nothing

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,720
till every single one of us is erased
from the face of history.

21
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,960
- Do you have any suggestions?
- Run.

22
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,080
It's been quite a while
since I time-jumped

23
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,280
far enough to experience
side effects.

24
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,400
Fond memories.

25
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,800
- I can't feel my face.
- Fine feel I.

26
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,080
Linguistic dysplasia,
that should pass shortly.

27
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,640
Better it now.

28
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,320
Am I the only one
who can't feel their face?

29
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,640
I can't feel my...

30
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,840
I better not say.

31
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,080
Mr. Rory appears unaffected.

32
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,480
What's going on?

33
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,320
- We time-jump?
- Yeah, we time-jumped.

34
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,520
But "where to?"
is the better question.

35
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,920
The town of Salvation,
the Dakota territory, 1871.

36
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,400
I can't believe it, the Old West.

37
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,240
- This isn't going to work.
- It'll buy us time.

38
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,560
We can hide out here
while the Hunters search

39
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,680
the other Fragmentations.

40
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,200
What if they decide
to check this place first?

41
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,760
You know, feel free to loop us
in whenever it's convenient.

42
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,320
As you've seen, time doesn't
operate as is generally thought.

43
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,560
It wants to happen.
It takes time to harden.

44
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,960
The... the timeline is unclear
on occasion, constantly in flux.

45
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,800
Hence the difficulty
in locating Savage

46
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,120
- throughout history.
- Indeed.

47
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,480
And one of the other
interesting notions

48
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,720
of time travel is the existence
of Fragmentations.

49
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,000
Temporal blind spots,

50
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,920
specific places and times
the Time Masters can't see.

51
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,120
The town of Salvation
and its surrounding environs

52
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,560
are located within one
of these Fragmentations.

53
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,000
So, basically,
we're hiding out in the Old West

54
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,520
and hoping your boogeymen
don't find us here.

55
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,600
The Hunters are not boogeymen.

56
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,520
And you better hope
they don't find us.

57
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,040
Well, at least not until
I get a chance

58
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,200
to "punch a few doggies"
or "bust a bronco" or two.

59
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,960
Not that I condone animal cruelty.

60
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,600
It's just that I watched a lot
of Westerns as a kid.

61
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,920
Alas, you'll have to enjoy
the Old West from in here,

62
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,240
- I'm afraid.
- Oh, come on.

63
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,360
What's the harm
in us just taking a look around?

64
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,720
With this group?

65
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,280
Clearly, you haven't been
paying attention.

66
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,200
If I'm in the Old West
and I don't get to look around,

67
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,840
I'm going to kick myself.

68
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,520
I could help with that.

69
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,400
I'll keep an eye on them.
Don't worry.

70
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,640
I'll be a good boy.

71
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,840
I look just like Wyatt Earp.

72
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,600
Now, the fabricator
can make clothing,

73
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,960
but you're also going to need
era-appropriate protection.

74
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,200
This era can get a little rough.

75
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,840
- Oh, six shooters?
- Actually, most guns

76
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,720
of that time period
had hammer blocks,

77
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,200
thus reducing the number
of shots to five.

78
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,360
Now, this should go without saying,

79
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,640
but considering this group,
I am going to say it.

80
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,680
Only use these weapons
in the case of extreme emergencies.

81
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,000
You make it sound
like you're not coming with.

82
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,040
From your duster and revolver,
I'd imagined you

83
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,840
as much an Old West aficionado
as Dr. Palmer.

84
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,200
Indeed I am.
But my time is best spent back here

85
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,160
on the ship, plotting our next
move against Vandal Savage.

86
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,560
Besides, as Mr. Rory says,
it's only a matter of time

87
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,920
before the Hunters find us here.

88
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,520
Don't worry.
We're not going to put down roots.

89
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,600
Yeah, we'll stay out of trouble.

90
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,320
How I hope and pray that to be true.

91
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,040
Remember, we're just here
to get the lay of the land.

92
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,440
{\an5}- No trouble.
- Sure, that'll happen.

93
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,800
I need a drink.

94
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,920
Wow. It's a real old-timey saloon.

95
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,640
Oh, I beg your pardon.

96
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,760
Not at all, ma'am.

97
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,640
That tastes like gasoline.

98
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,520
Pretty much. Hit me again.

99
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,320
Oh, I'm so sorry.

100
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,400
It's no bother.

101
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,840
{\an5}Time doesn't pass normally
in the Vanishing Point.

102
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,920
{\an5}It's been years since I've seen
the bottom of a glass.

103
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,040
Years?

104
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,760
How long were you...

105
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,880
Chronos?

106
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,800
Never counted. Doesn't matter.

107
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,720
{\an5}Turns out it was
just another gig anyway.

108
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,280
Doesn't seem like it.

109
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,480
You're different now.

110
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,800
Better or worse?

111
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,280
Don't know yet.

112
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,520
{\an5}You can handle your liquor.
I like that.

113
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,520
{\an5}I've been on more than a few dates
with guys who thought

114
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,280
{\an5}we'd get wasted and they'd get lucky.

115
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,000
{\an5}But somehow, they always ended up
the ones under the table.

116
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,960
You haven't drunk with me.

117
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,400
Is that a challenge, Mick?

118
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,200
Line them up.

119
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,880
Didn't know you played cards.

120
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,680
Like you, Mr. Snart, I am an enigma.

121
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,800
Raise.

122
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,560
Thank you, gentlemen.

123
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,240
I'm impressed.

124
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,320
My father was what some might call

125
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,120
{\an5}a degenerate gambler,
others would say criminal.

126
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,320
{\an5}When I was old enough, he'd pull
me in on some of his schemes.

127
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,240
{\an5}I picked up a thing or two at a few
of the card tables he frequented.

128
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,480
Then I took a different path.

129
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,360
{\an5}Like father, like son
isn't always inevitable, Mr. Snart.

130
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,800
- I had a full boat.
- As did I.

131
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,680
{\an5}Full of kings,
which beats your pair of queens.

132
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,000
Don't I look busy to you?

133
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,480
I'm sorry. I...

134
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,800
{\an5}If you spill another drop of that
whiskey, and you will be...

135
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,240
Just because you're losing

136
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,880
{\an5}doesn't mean you have
to pick on the waitstaff.

137
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,240
Mind your own business, grandpa.

138
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,000
Unhand the lady.

139
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,480
Now, now, boys.
Let's just take it easy.

140
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,160
{\an5}Oh, when my friend here
is being reasonable,

141
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,600
we know we have a problem.

142
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,360
I'm not the one with the problem.

143
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,520
You are.

144
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,680
You killed him.

145
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,560
You're welcome.

146
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,760
Clearly, the deceased
was a friend of yours.

147
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,800
- But my friend here...
- Your friend drew first,

148
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,400
got put down.

149
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,640
It was a clean shot.

150
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,480
Do we look like we care about clean?

151
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,560
He has a point.

152
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,040
All right!

153
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,920
Playtime's over.

154
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,680
Anybody's got a problem with that,
they answer to me.

155
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,680
Thank you, Mister...

156
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,760
Hex.

157
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,000
Jonah Hex.

158
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,720
You're not from around here,
are you?

159
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,520
No.

160
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,600
My friends and I are...

161
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,080
from out of town.

162
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,000
Way out of town.

163
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,800
All right.

164
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,240
Why don't you folks tell me
where you're really from?

165
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,640
I'm not sure that's
any of your business, sir.

166
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,200
Let me rephrase that.

167
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,480
Tell me when y'all from.

168
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,200
You seven stick out
like a dog in a manger.

169
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,840
Like he said,
we're not from around here.

170
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,480
You think you're
the first time travelers

171
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,040
I've ever come across?

172
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,440
Yes.

173
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,480
Where is he?

174
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,200
I got some words that need saying.

175
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,320
Where is who?

176
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,480
Rip Hunter.

177
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,760
What is it about you people

178
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,320
that whenever we go
to a new timeline,

179
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,880
you feel the need to pick up...

180
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,840
strays?

181
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,720
Nice.

182
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,840
I didn't get to see it
last time around.

183
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,920
Last time?

184
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,520
A long story
which we will not be telling.

185
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,240
My coat suits you good.

186
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,040
What are you doing here, Jonah?

187
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,920
Collecting on a bounty,

188
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,920
wetting my whistle,

189
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,000
when your friends here
got in a lot of trouble.

190
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,200
We might've gotten into
a barroom brawl back in town.

191
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,720
Well, that was entirely predictable.

192
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,200
One of them poured lead into
a member of the Stillwater gang.

193
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,160
- Mr. Rory.
- Snart, actually.

194
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,600
Oh, that was gonna be my next guess.

195
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,480
This guy tried to kill Grey.

196
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,040
Snart saved him.

197
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,480
And brought this town a whole
lot of hell in the bargain.

198
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,320
Those boys you were trading
hands with in the saloon.

199
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,600
They're all members
of the Stillwater gang.

200
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,480
Why can't a gang ever be
a bunch of good guys?

201
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,400
Jeb Stillwater and his friends

202
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,160
were raiding this town
for the past three months.

203
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,160
Stealing, robbing, killing.

204
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,160
Well, he'll have to go through us.

205
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,120
No, he won't.

206
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,760
No doubt your, your little ruckus

207
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,040
has already placed
the timeline at risk,

208
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,360
to say nothing of potentially
alerting the Hunters

209
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,640
to our presence here.

210
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,560
Sounds like someone's planning
on busting out of town again.

211
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,200
- Leaving already?
- No. No.

212
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,120
Look, this town is being terrorized
by the Stillwater gang.

213
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,360
And I aim to do something about it.

214
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,440
You "aim to"?

215
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,560
You getting all native on us,
Haircut?

216
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,920
Look, we signed on to this mission...

217
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,720
- To stop Vandal Savage.
- To be heroes.

218
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,640
And saving a town
from a marauding gang of criminals...

219
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,440
that is what heroes do.

220
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,480
Quite a posse of saints
you're riding along with nowadays.

221
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,040
Hey. Bridge is... that way.

222
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,880
Yeah, I'm not going to the bridge.
I'm...

223
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,960
Where am I going, Gideon?

224
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,160
<i>The valley you described
is consistent with Albano Gulch.</i>

225
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,400
Yeah, there.

226
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,120
Okay, wait. Why?

227
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,480
Back at the saloon,
I ran into a woman

228
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,880
and she caused me to have
more memory flashes, so...

229
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,360
I think I might have known her
in one of my past lives.

230
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,720
And if so, she might be able
to help me find Carter.

231
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,760
Wait. So you're just gonna run
out there and try and find her?

232
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,760
Actually, I was planning on flying.

233
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,520
You want a partner in crime?

234
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,960
Okay, fine.

235
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,800
But you're definitely
not carrying me.

236
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,600
How do you propose we get there?

237
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,840
Howdy. I'm Ray...

238
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,760
John Wayne.

239
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,240
What do you want, Mr. Wayne?

240
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,680
Well, I... I reckon you could use

241
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,800
another hand
with the Stillwater gang.

242
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,760
You boys have any experience
with law enforcement?

243
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,920
Well, I have a fair bit
of experience fighting crime.

244
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,240
Congratulations, then.

245
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,800
You're making me your deputy?

246
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,120
Nope.
Just made you the new sheriff.

247
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,840
- Excuse me. What?
- Stillwater gang

248
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,480
has been shooting up this town
for months now.

249
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,680
It's only by the grace
of the good Lord

250
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,600
that I'm not
pushing up daisies myself.

251
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,720
And I am done with pushing my luck.

252
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,960
But you're the...

253
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,160
sheriff.

254
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,480
Congratulations.

255
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,760
By the way,

256
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,000
you might find a warrant
or two out for me

257
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,160
around these parts.

258
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,680
You know, we have stuff
back on the ship

259
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,640
that can fix your, you know.

260
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,720
Fix what?

261
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,920
Yep. Nothing. Never mind.

262
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,520
- What can I get you?
- Information.

263
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,400
Some friends of mine
are looking for Jeb Stillwater.

264
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,600
If they're the same friends
that shot Billy Conlon

265
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,360
and beat on the Stillwater posse,

266
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,360
I can guarantee you he'll find you.

267
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,720
That being said, we'd very
much like to find him first.

268
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,640
You got any more of them greenbacks?

269
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,120
Let me go find a map.

270
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,600
Excuse me, ma'am.
Are you all right?

271
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,480
I'm fine.

272
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,840
I just want to be alone.

273
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,880
I understand.

274
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,920
I'm new to these parts.

275
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,040
I didn't think it was customary
for a lady to drink alone.

276
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,640
Tonic water.

277
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,560
It's for my son.

278
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,120
I just needed a moment to myself.

279
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,120
Is everything all right?

280
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,120
I should be getting back to my boy.

281
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,000
If there's something wrong with him,
perhaps I can be of assistance.

282
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,760
I happen to be a scientist.

283
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,920
That's kind.

284
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,520
But I'm afraid
there's nothing you can do.

285
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,440
My boy is going to die.

286
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,760
What's wrong with him?

287
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,680
He has the consumption, they say.

288
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,000
Tuberculosis.

289
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,680
He's been like this on and off
for about a year now.

290
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,040
He always wanted to see
the American West.

291
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,080
Our doctor thought a constitutional
might do him some good.

292
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,680
It hasn't, clearly.

293
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,040
You know,
there are medicines that...

294
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,600
The doctor here says he has a day...

295
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,440
maybe two, if he's lucky.

296
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,040
Does he look lucky to you, Mister...

297
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,720
I don't know your name.

298
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,680
It's Martin.

299
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,280
Hello, young man.

300
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,480
We call him Bertie.

301
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Bertie.

302
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,600
Your mother tells me
you wanted to come out west.

303
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,880
Can't imagine
you've seen much of it yet.

304
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,200
I want to ride a stagecoach.

305
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,320
Well, in that case...

306
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,240
I encourage you to get better.

307
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,720
My mum... she's not sure I will.

308
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,000
Well, then you must prove
your mother wrong...

309
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,000
so you can ride that stagecoach.

310
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,160
One of mine is dead.

311
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,480
And this here town's gonna pay.

312
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,000
Now, who the hell
are you supposed to be?

313
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,960
John Wayne.

314
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,800
Salvation's new sheriff.

315
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,280
And this here town
is under my protection.

316
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,040
Well, you being new and all,

317
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,280
you don't know
about the arrangement that we got.

318
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,200
See, me and my boys,
we ride into town,

319
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,160
we take whatever we want.

320
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,000
In exchange for what?

321
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,840
Not killing nobody.

322
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,320
Well, that sounds reasonable and all,

323
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,280
but arrangement's over.

324
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,120
Arrangement's over, boys.

325
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,800
They teach you numbers
where it is you're from?

326
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,080
'Cause the way I see it,

327
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,760
there's only one of you

328
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,760
and a whole mess of us.

329
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,640
You get out of town,
and you don't come back,

330
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,960
or the next bullet goes in your eye.

331
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,800
I got sharpshooters all around.

332
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,520
You really want to test me?

333
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,120
Let's ride, boys.

334
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Hyah!

335
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,400
Nice, Haircut.

336
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,720
Dude, that was badass.

337
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,240
Let's not oversell it.

338
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,760
Running a bad guy out of town's
always been on my bucket list.

339
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,880
Bucket list?

340
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,000
A list of things one hopes
to accomplish before they die.

341
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,400
Well, you better hope
it's a real short list, String Bean.

342
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,160
We can handle the Stillwater gang.

343
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,960
Well, you're all just tearing up
the 1870s, aren't you?

344
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,080
Stillwater and his gang's
like a hornets' nest,

345
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,440
and your friends here
keep poking at it.

346
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,640
They saved the town
from being raided, man.

347
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,840
Today, but what about tomorrow?

348
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,720
Or the day after that?

349
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,600
For a bunch of time travelers,

350
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,720
you don't seem to understand
the future much.

351
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,240
The day will come
when you'll all leave...

352
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,240
and Salvation
will end up like Calvert.

353
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,840
- What's a Calvert?
- A closed matter.

354
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,960
A word, Mr. Hex?

355
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,520
I believe you've all done enough
for one day.

356
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,800
Well, now I definitely want
to know what a Calvert is.

357
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,880
Then it's a good thing we have access
to a supercomputer.

358
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,960
Gideon?

359
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,200
<i>Calvert was a town
in Oklahoma circa 1868.</i>

360
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,280
Was?

361
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,720
You know, there's something
weird going on with your face.

362
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,040
- What?
- You're smiling.

363
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,080
I didn't know you could do that.

364
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,240
Well, don't tell anyone my secret.

365
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,800
It's just all of this...

366
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,760
it's so pure, so simple.

367
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,760
I'd say I miss simple,

368
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,760
but I guess you have
to experience something first

369
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,120
to miss it.

370
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,320
I know what you mean.

371
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,440
I've been having more and more
memory flashes lately,

372
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,840
and I'm not entirely sure why.

373
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,840
Well, if this woman was a friend
of yours in a past life,

374
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,120
hopefully she'll have
another piece for your puzzle.

375
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,960
I feel like I'm being drawn
to this place.

376
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,560
- Which way?
- There.

377
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,240
You know, stealing's against the law.

378
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,920
I'm the sheriff of these here parts.

379
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,480
How did you know
I was appropriating this medicine?

380
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,360
<i>That was my fault, Professor.</i>

381
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,720
Et tu, Gideon?

382
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,760
I suppose this is going to earn me
a lecture

383
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,880
on the perils
of upsetting the timeline

384
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,520
by introducing futuristic
medicine to the 19th century.

385
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,960
Well, it seems you've already
given it to yourself.

386
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,160
Except this isn't
futuristic medicine.

387
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,720
I've had Gideon fabricate
simple streptomycin for me.

388
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,800
Excuse me.

389
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,800
Which won't be used in medical
treatments for another 70 years.

390
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,160
This is about a boy in town

391
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,240
who's dying
of an easily curable disease.

392
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,480
Just as you couldn't turn
your back on Jeb Stillwater

393
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,880
and his gang, I can't turn mine
on this boy and his mother.

394
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,240
Except Dr. Palmer is using
19th century technology

395
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,680
to deal with Stillwater,
whereas you...

396
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,720
Just spare me the lecture,
Captain Hunter.

397
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,120
You, of all people...

398
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,840
This isn't about the mission, Martin!

399
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,600
Do you not recall what happened
when Dr. Palmer

400
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:53,840
left a bit of his suit back in 1975
and nearly destroyed Central City?

401
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,160
That was an accident.

402
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:59,040
I'm not talking about our mission
or Dr. Palmer's technological gaffe.

403
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,000
Calvert...

404
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,120
that town clearly holds some
emotional resonance for you,

405
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,560
judging from the looks
you've been exchanging with Mr. Hex.

406
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,040
How do you know it's a town?

407
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,520
Gideon?

408
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,920
Calvert, Oklahoma.

409
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,120
What happened to you there, Rip?

410
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,720
And why is it so important to you?

411
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,240
Because the past is prologue.

412
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,560
It's not uncommon for criminal posses

413
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,000
such as Mr. Stillwater's to sack
and pillage towns

414
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,600
which they find uncooperative.

415
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,800
So Stillwater's done this before?

416
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,760
In the case of Calvert,
it was Quentin Turnbull's doing.

417
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,720
But it was my fault.

418
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,880
I'd come to Calvert on a mission
from the Time Masters.

419
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,320
This was years
before my son Jonas was born.

420
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,080
Jonas...

421
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,160
Did you name your son after Hex?

422
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,080
After my mission was completed,

423
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,280
I felt unable to leave.

424
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,960
I'd grown so attached to this era...

425
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,080
a victim of the same
time drift you experienced in 1958.

426
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,040
But obviously you left at some point.

427
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:06,800
Left? I had to tear myself away
from the time period

428
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,920
for fear that I would never see
my then-future wife, Miranda,

429
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,120
ever again.

430
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,280
Turnbull attacked Calvert
the very next day.

431
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,440
So...

432
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,480
you can understand why I must act.

433
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,400
No, Martin, I don't.

434
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,120
As I said before,
this is advanced medicine

435
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,200
unsuitable to the period,

436
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,600
to say nothing
of what this boy's survival

437
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,400
might do to the timeline.

438
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,520
Be that as it may,

439
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,200
I refuse to live with the regret
I see on your face right now.

440
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,760
The information Mr. Stein got
from the barkeep paid out.

441
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,760
I know where
the Stillwater gang's holed up.

442
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,880
All right. Let's ride.

443
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,000
Up high.

444
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,760
You coming, Rip?

445
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,480
That's what I thought.

446
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,720
I wonder why she lives alone
all the way out here.

447
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,920
Because...

448
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,080
I value my privacy!

449
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,560
Wait, wait, wait.

450
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,960
Don't you remember me...

451
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,080
from the saloon back in Salvation?

452
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,560
I remembered you,
you wigged-out little girl.

453
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,880
If I'd wanted to talk to you then,
I would have talked to you then.

454
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,560
I ain't fixing to talk to you now.

455
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,240
Now, get off of my land!

456
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,480
Listen, we're not trying
to start any trouble.

457
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,680
Do you want that pretty little
mouth of yours filled with lead?

458
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,840
Your friend has a colorful
personality.

459
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:47,400
I ain't got friends.
I keep to myself.

460
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,960
She's right.

461
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,520
She wasn't my friend.

462
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,720
I was her.

463
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,480
We sat for that picture
at the county fair, 1830.

464
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,960
He looked like such a gentleman.

465
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,800
- What was his name?
- Hannibal.

466
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,720
Hannibal Hawkes.

467
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,080
And what happened?

468
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,520
Was it Savage?

469
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,320
What is this?

470
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,480
It looks familiar.

471
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,640
That was ours in our first life.

472
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,840
I remember.

473
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,600
We crossed with Savage
in Jefferson City.

474
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,760
He had it with him.

475
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,400
We escaped with it and our lives.

476
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,640
Do you still have it?

477
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,960
We lost it to bandits
about a year later.

478
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,200
We heard that the Pinkertons
were after the same bandits,

479
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,320
but we just...

480
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,400
Hey.

481
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,640
What is it?

482
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,440
Objects present
at the moment of my...

483
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,320
our first death

484
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,240
can be used to kill Savage.

485
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,360
So, if I can get my hands
on that bracelet, then...

486
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,920
You're going to try
to kill Savage with a bracelet?

487
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,720
You need to stop.

488
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,920
- Stop what?
- Fighting our destiny.

489
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,920
Ain't destiny what brought you here?

490
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,160
What part of destiny is she fighting?

491
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,280
All of it.

492
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,680
We get reborn. We find Hannibal...

493
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,680
Carter, then Savage finds us,
and then we die.

494
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,600
That's... that's the way it is.

495
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,960
It's the way it's always gonna be.

496
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,120
I don't believe that.

497
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,840
Well, I have a few more years on you.

498
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,680
You can't break the cycle.

499
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,280
That's why I live out here, alone.

500
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,920
For the rest of your life?

501
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,160
Well, I guess I had to figure
that out the hard way.

502
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,800
I was still a young woman
when Savage left me a widow.

503
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,760
Instead of waiting for him
to find me and kill me

504
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,160
so that I could love my Hannibal
in the next life,

505
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,000
I tried to find love in this one.

506
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,000
Talk about a curse.

507
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,920
What happened?

508
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,280
He was a good man,
but he wasn't a soul mate.

509
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,240
It was like fate was trying
to break us apart.

510
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,200
Eventually,
fate broke both our hearts.

511
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,720
So I made a promise to myself

512
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,960
that I wasn't gonna do that
to a person again.

513
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,960
I'm... I'm sorry to hear that.

514
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,480
No, I'm who's sorry...

515
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,640
to have to be the one to let you know

516
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,480
that you're never going to be
able to love anyone else, ever.

517
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,080
How much do you know
about our previous lives?

518
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,440
I reckon not a lot
because you didn't recognize me.

519
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,320
So let me tell you
that we did love other men,

520
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,840
loved them real and pure,

521
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,920
but it never ended well, not ever.

522
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,560
Tragedy or heartbreak...

523
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,120
that's how it always ends
if the man's not Carter.

524
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,680
We could've used Sara
on this roundup.

525
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,280
A lady? You crazy?

526
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,400
Just remember,
we're here to arrest Stillwater,

527
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,680
not kill him.

528
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,640
He always this much
of a stick in the mud?

529
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,720
Yes.

530
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,760
How?

531
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,040
It's a miracle.

532
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,160
Oh, it's, it's not a miracle,
I can assure you.

533
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,960
- Mrs. Neal...
- Sarah.

534
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,240
Sarah...

535
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,440
when the illness is gone,

536
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,680
I need you to promise me
that you'll take what's left

537
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,560
of the medicine and burn it,
vials and all.

538
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,680
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

539
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,200
Yes, I shall do it.

540
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,960
Sarah...

541
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,200
I wish you well.

542
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,320
Thank you.

543
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,880
I really must be going.

544
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,400
Oh, damn.

545
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,840
These boys got some stones.

546
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,880
Jeb Stillwater, you are under arrest.

547
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,960
You have the right to remain silent.
You have the right to an attorney.

548
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,240
There won't be Miranda rights
for another 100 years.

549
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,760
Fall back! Fall back!

550
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,160
Jax!

551
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,400
- We got to go!
- Not without Jax!

552
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,480
Well, we got Stillwater.
It means we got leverage.

553
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,520
Live to fight another day
or die tonight.

554
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,080
Your choice. Hyah!

555
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,160
Where is Stillwater?

556
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,560
He's knocked out cold
in the med bay.

557
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,800
Well, this is a simple matter.

558
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,400
We trade Stillwater for Jefferson
as Mr. Hex suggested.

559
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,680
It's not that simple.

560
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,280
If we release Stillwater,
we're back to square one

561
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,600
and the town is still in danger.

562
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,920
So is the kid.

563
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,360
And we'll figure out a way
to get him back

564
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,880
without releasing Stillwater.

565
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,120
I got a notion.

566
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,320
Set up a quick draw.

567
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,640
You win,

568
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,840
get your guy back.

569
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,400
You lose,

570
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,960
you set Stillwater free.

571
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,440
And, by "lose," you mean...

572
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,720
Get shot and killed.

573
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,360
Oh, great. Pistols at high noon.

574
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,280
Finally, someone's talking sense.

575
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,440
There has to be another way,
a better way.

576
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,520
Sure.

577
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,200
Go after Stillwater with all
your gear from the future.

578
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,560
I don't know how that'll sit
with your captain, though.

579
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,600
Let's assume it's a bad idea.

580
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,080
So who's standing
in the middle of Main Street?

581
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,480
I'll do it.

582
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,280
Raymond, now is not the time
to indulge your cowboy fantasies.

583
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,000
No one else is stepping forward.

584
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,440
Plus, I'm a decent shot...

585
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,800
at least I was with an air rifle.

586
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,720
I can't believe
you're encouraging this.

587
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,920
You know it's the only way.

588
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,480
Dr. Palmer's going to get
himself killed.

589
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,400
I think you forfeited
your right to an opinion

590
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,640
when you refused to leave the ship
since we've been here.

591
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,040
I had good reason.

592
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,280
Because of Calvert.

593
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,400
Yes, but not in the way you think.

594
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,600
Leaving Calvert, leaving this... era

595
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,120
is one of the hardest things
I've ever had to do.

596
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,600
And why is that, Captain?

597
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,760
A Time Master is trained to do
his work without interference,

598
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,600
which means not helping people
or being a hero.

599
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,360
But as you've seen, Dr. Palmer,
this era offers

600
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,560
many opportunities for heroism.

601
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,840
I found it...

602
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,240
enticing.

603
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,680
And you still managed to leave.

604
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,760
Something's been bugging me
all these years.

605
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:43,120
If you'd have known what
Turnbull was going to do to Calvert,

606
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,280
would you have left?

607
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,120
That's the thing, Jonah.

608
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,200
I did know.

609
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,720
- I deserve that.
- You deserve a lot worse.

610
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,160
You knew, and you still left?

611
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,120
Of course, I knew.
I was a Time Master.

612
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,640
And therein lay the problem.
Like Raymond, like Martin,

613
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,120
I felt the pull of heroism,
of this era's penchant

614
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,000
for being rife with opportunities
to make a difference.

615
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,360
That's one of the things
that called to me,

616
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,520
and that is why I had to leave.

617
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,040
Because had I stayed...

618
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,240
I could no longer
have remained a Time Master.

619
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,720
But I'm no longer a Time Master...

620
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,520
which is why I'll face Stillwater.

621
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,520
Wait. I said that I would do it.

622
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,600
And get yourself shot and killed?

623
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,560
It's appreciated,
but I'd rather you stayed alive.

624
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,520
Send word to Stillwater's posse.

625
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,760
I believe high noon is
in less than three hours.

626
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,880
You want to talk about it?

627
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,240
Not really.

628
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,920
You don't have to listen to her,
you know?

629
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,080
Is this you not talking about it?

630
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,760
No. This is me ignoring you

631
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,480
saying you don't want
to talk about it.

632
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,480
Look, I get it.

633
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:15,080
Things may have gone
very wrong for Old West you

634
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,840
and whoever she loved
who wasn't Carter.

635
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,080
But?

636
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,920
But Old West you
didn't know Ray Palmer.

637
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,640
She didn't love Ray Palmer.

638
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,600
You do.

639
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,120
And you have to live your life.

640
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,320
She already lived hers.

641
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:44,720
- You think Hunter can pull this off?
- Reasonably.

642
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:48,480
If not, I got dibs on that
newfangled revolver of his.

643
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,840
You sure about this?

644
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,000
Well, if anything, it feels
good to be out here again,

645
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,240
in this era.

646
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,760
Well, don't get too attached.

647
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:13,640
That is what I keep telling myself.

648
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,800
I'll be drawing for Sheriff Palmer.

649
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,640
How do me and my boys know
you're going to keep your word?

650
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,000
Sheriff Palmer's a straight shooter.

651
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,320
Then he should be
the one in the street.

652
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,280
- Jefferson, are you all right?
- Yeah.

653
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,960
Did you just shoot somebody for me?

654
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,520
Yeah. You're welcome.

655
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,360
I don't think we're done here yet.

656
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,880
Oh, no.

657
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,000
They found us.

658
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,680
Friends! Welcome.

659
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,080
I think you'll find this
slightly more effective

660
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,720
than your current sidearm.

661
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,680
Yes, I will be wanting
that back, by the way.

662
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,760
And you'll be needing this.

663
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,800
What about revealing
our future tech to the locals?

664
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,520
It doesn't seem to bother them.
Shall we?

665
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,480
What about our guns?

666
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,800
Sorry. Grabbed what I could.

667
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,480
That's what's up!

668
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,200
Y'all better stay the hell
away from us!

669
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,720
<i>Calm down, Jefferson.</i>

670
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,080
- Traitor!
- Not possible.

671
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,640
I was never on your side.
I was on my side.

672
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:07,160
- You'll never win!
- Wake up, pal. We already did.

673
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:21,120
Fool. The Time Masters
have initiated Omega Protocol.

674
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,640
The Pilgrim's coming for you,
Chronos.

675
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,880
Your deaths are
just a matter of time.

676
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,880
Yeah, yeah.

677
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,760
Well, that was easy.

678
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,240
- You're not staying.
- Are you?

679
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,920
Me? You know I can't.

680
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,200
But this town still needs a sheriff.

681
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,080
Well, I'm not
the law-and-order type...

682
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,480
nor the staying-in-one-place
type either.

683
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,200
Well, we have that much
in common at least.

684
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,600
At least.

685
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,680
Be well, Jonah.

686
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,160
Nice thing about my world

687
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,760
for you, it ain't going anywhere.

688
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,400
Perhaps we will see each other again,
my friend.

689
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,080
Yeah.

690
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,840
I reckon that'd be okay.

691
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,000
- Interesting fella.
- Indeed.

692
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,880
This town's seen
a lot of interesting.

693
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,120
Suppose you got
one of those doohickies

694
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,800
that erases people's memories
or something?

695
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,160
No. But...

696
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,880
skepticism and disbelief
are a far more effective tool.

697
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,200
So, if anybody here talks,
no one will believe them.

698
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,680
Would you, Mr. Snart?

699
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,920
I'm not going to pretend
to understand what I saw.

700
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,680
I'd prefer that you didn't
tell anyone about it either.

701
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,160
That goes for you too,
young Master Neal.

702
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,840
- My last name's Wells.
- Excuse me?

703
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,480
His father's surname.

704
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,000
Herbert George Wells.

705
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,600
You're H.G. Wells.

706
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,640
H.G. I like that.

707
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,680
Astonishing.

708
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,440
God, it feels so good to be
in normal clothes again.

709
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,600
The people here need to invent
fabric softener asap.

710
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,680
Is that all?

711
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,240
It's just that
you've seemed a little off

712
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,120
ever since you came back
from your walkabout.

713
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,560
Ray, I told you...

714
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,600
Something, but I don't
think it's the whole truth.

715
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,560
I thought that we decided to be
honest with each other.

716
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,360
And I am.

717
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,680
I am being honest with you, Ray.

718
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:53,320
Look, I met a woman,
and I learned some things.

719
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,520
I told you about killing Savage.

720
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,880
And the rest...

721
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,840
The rest is what she thought.

722
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,200
Not what I think.

723
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,480
I don't have to listen to her.

724
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,920
I love you.

725
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,760
I love you too.

726
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,280
I think they're waiting for us
on the bridge.

727
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,360
We should go.

728
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,440
So how are you feeling,
given your concerns

729
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,480
about becoming addicted
to this era once again?

730
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,720
The last time I left, Martin,

731
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,560
I did it to be
with those closest to me.

732
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,520
I'm doing the same again.

733
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,160
So where to now?

734
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,120
Or, more specifically, when?

735
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,240
Is there another Fragmentation
we can hide out in?

736
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,080
Unfortunately, matters are
not quite so simple.

737
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,600
How'd I know you were gonna
say something like that?

738
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,840
- Rip's buddies.
- And yours.

739
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,600
The Time Masters have issued
Omega Protocols on all of us.

740
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,120
That sounds pretty terrible.

741
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,120
The worst kind of order
they can issue...

742
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,520
they've sent the Pilgrim after us.

743
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,040
- Who's the Pilgrim?
- The Pilgrim is

744
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,200
the Time Masters'
most deadly assassin,

745
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,320
and she will stop at nothing

746
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,120
until each
and every one of you are dead.

747
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,000
Ooh, scary.

748
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,240
Pretty sure we can handle ourselves.

749
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,320
Indeed...

750
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,040
which is why
she won't be going after

751
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,680
the present-day versions of you.

752
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,840
She's hunting our younger selves.

753
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,600
{\an5}And she won't stop until each
and every one of us

754
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,560
has been erased from the timeline.
