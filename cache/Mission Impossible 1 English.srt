1
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:24,942
It was good...

2
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:29,821
...that you called us.

3
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:34,868
I don't know what happened.

4
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:37,871
We were at the bar...

5
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:41,124
...drinking...

6
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:43,961
...having fun...

7
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,672
I don't even know...

8
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:50,342
...how I got here.

9
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,888
Come on, come on.
She's been under too long.

10
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,933
You're the only one
who can help me.

11
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,024
Come on... come on,

12
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,527
tell me what I need to know.

13
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:09,861
Come on.

14
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,114
They'll kill me.

15
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,119
You asked for my help.

16
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:20,455
Come on.

17
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,334
Come on.

18
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:26,628
The contact in Minsk...

19
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:29,298
The name, pal.
Give us the name.

20
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,593
Dimitri...

21
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:34,636
...miediev.

22
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,569
What now?

23
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:53,989
Now we drink.

24
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:55,782
<i>Z</i> a <i>druziye.</i>

25
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:17,804
Get rid of that scum.

26
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:27,356
Hold her still.

27
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:31,902
Come on.

28
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,553
Did we get it?

29
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,014
We got it.

30
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,989
Would you like to watch a movie,
Mr. rosen?

31
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,240
No, thank you.

32
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,457
Would you like to watch
a movie, Mr. Phelps?

33
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,041
No, I prefer the theater.

34
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:13,712
Would you consider the cinema
of the Ukraine?

35
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,132
Perhaps you'll choose one for me.

36
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,180
Thank you.

37
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:50,123
<i>Good morning, Mr. Phelps.</i>

38
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:53,001
<i>The man you're looking at
is Alexander golitsyn...</i>

39
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:55,545
<i>An attache' at our embassy in Prague.</i>

40
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,464
<i>He is also a traitor.</i>

41
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:01,468
<i>He has stolen one half
of a CIA noc list...</i>

42
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:05,138
<i>A record of all our deep-cover agents
working in eastern Europe.</i>

43
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:09,267
<i>For security reasons,
the noc list is divided in two.</i>

44
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:13,396
<i>The portion that golitsyn already has
contains code names</i>

45
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,607
<i>but this half is useless
without its mate</i>

46
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,235
<i>which matches the code names
with their true names.</i>

47
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:22,989
<i>It is this half which golitsyn plans
to steal from the embassy</i>

48
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,492
<i>during a reception tomorrow night.</i>

49
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,161
<i>Your mission, Jim,
should you choose to accept it</i>

50
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:31,289
<i>is to obtain photographic proof
of the theft,</i>

51
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:35,293
<i>shadow golitsyn to his buyer,
and apprehend them both.</i>

52
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:39,756
<i>I've already dispatched a team,
selected from your usual group.</i>

53
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,925
<i>Sarah Davies is already undercover.</i>

54
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:45,262
<i>Jack harmon can hack
into any security system.</i>

55
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,597
<i>Hannah Williams
will handle surveillance.</i>

56
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:50,350
<i>Your wife, Claire, will cover transport,</i>

57
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:54,020
<i>and Ethan hunt will be
your point man, as usual.</i>

58
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,815
<i>He is now in Kiev
and will rendezvous in Prague</i>

59
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,817
<i>at a safe house of your choosing.</i>

60
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:02,153
<i>As always, should you or any member
of your im force</i>

61
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:04,030
<i>be caught or killed,</i>

62
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:07,617
<i>the secretary will disavow
all knowledge of your actions.</i>

63
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:10,704
<i>This tape will self-destruct
in five seconds.</i>

64
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:11,788
<i>Good luck, Jim.</i>

65
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,605
A very straightforward objective.

66
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,233
We photograph golitsyn stealing
the noc list,

67
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,360
follow him to his buyer,

68
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:44,529
apprehend both of them.

69
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,448
Now here's the plot.

70
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:50,785
Ethan, you're going into the embassy
in character, during a party,

71
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:53,079
hide in plain sight,
highest possible profile.

72
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:56,791
- You game?
- Wouldn't have it any other way.

73
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:00,253
Sarah, you're at the party already

74
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:02,422
as the embassy's
Washington visitor liaison.

75
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:05,550
Make contact with Ethan.
You'll run the game together.

76
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,135
I haven't a thing to wear.

77
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:11,348
Well, I'm sure you'll work it out.

78
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:14,476
You'll mark golitsyn,
hand him off to Hannah.

79
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,062
Hannah, you'll have him
for the duration of the interior.

80
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:20,148
- Find yourself a perch and stay on him.
- No problem.

81
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,650
- Jack?
- Yeah?

82
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:25,320
Fingerprint security, there's access
through the elevator shaft here.

83
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,614
So I guess I'm not wearing my tux.

84
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,282
Open, close, get out.

85
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,409
Zero residual presence.

86
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,329
- Claire...
- Mmm-hmm.

87
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,830
You're cover outside in the vehicle.

88
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:38,667
Hannah will join you as golitsyn
goes exterior,

89
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,419
-you two stay on him from there.
- Okay.

90
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,254
Anything goes wrong, I call abort.

91
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,715
Everybody walk away immediately.

92
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:50,053
Regroup here at 4:00 A.M. that's 0400.

93
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:52,013
Any questions?

94
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:54,891
Yeah.

95
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,769
Can we get a cappuccino machine in here?

96
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,270
'Cause I don't know what you call this.

97
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,398
I call it cruel and unusual.

98
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,817
- I made that coffee.
- Exactly.

99
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,528
Is it possible it's even worse than
that sludge you made

100
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,238
-in that barn in Kiev?
- Thank you.

101
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,156
Take it easy on my wife's coffee,
will you?

102
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:14,160
- Oh, we missed you in Kiev, Jim.
- Missed you too, Ethan.

103
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:16,413
Were you off on one of your
cushy recruiting assignments again?

104
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,415
Where'd they put you up this time?
The Plaza?

105
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,792
Drake hotel, Chicago.

106
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,211
What a shame.

107
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:26,172
-24-hour room service.
- Chauffeured cars.

108
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:27,549
Fat expense account.

109
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:30,343
- Now he's getting soft in his old age.
- Yeah, he is. Look at him.

110
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,303
Okay, listen.

111
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:34,973
If that list gets out into the open

112
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:37,767
the names of our agents
in every country in eastern Europe

113
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,103
will be up for grabs
to the highest bidders.

114
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,565
Third world terrorists, arms dealers,
drug lords,

115
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:46,860
any and everybody who'd love
to get rid of long-term coverts like us.

116
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:51,448
If they're exposed, they'll be executed.

117
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,536
So I'll run the whole show
from the crow's nest here.

118
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:59,372
Everyone knows their roles.
Let's punch out the details.

119
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:02,250
There's a camera built
right into the bridge.

120
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,712
Whatever you see, it sees,
and then it transmits it back here.

121
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,380
See?

122
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:09,257
Can you hear me?

123
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,926
- Of course, I can hear you.
- No, in your...

124
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,845
- You need an earpiece.
- Oh.

125
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:19,434
You have lovely eyes.

126
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:22,062
- Can you hear me now?
- Loud and clear.

127
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,522
If he has a car waiting
and he rolls,

128
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,441
you stay with him no matter what.

129
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,651
You should take the afternoon,

130
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,528
drive the streets
around this little quarter.

131
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:32,322
- They're confusing as hell.
- Mmm.

132
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,657
What do you think
I've been doing all morning?

133
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,994
- We're using waltzer?
- He's our guy.

134
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,122
Isn't he chairing
the armed services hearing?

135
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,668
Not this week.
This week, he's fly-fishing

136
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:47,921
at the oughterard slough
in county kildare

137
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,465
-with one of our best Irish guides.
- Yep.

138
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,717
And he won't be back anytime soon.

139
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:57,722
<i>...irrelevant at best
or unconstitutional at worst.</i>

140
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:59,432
<i>With all due respect, senator,</i>

141
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:02,185
<i>it sounds as if you want
to lead the kind of charge</i>

142
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,480
<i>that senator frank church
led in the 1970s</i>

143
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,690
<i>and in the process destroy</i>

144
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:08,858
<i>the intelligence capability
of this country.</i>

145
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:09,984
<i>No, John.</i>

146
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:12,070
<i>I want to know who these people are</i>

147
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:15,240
<i>and how they're spending
our taxpayers' money.</i>

148
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:18,743
<i>We were living in a democracy
the last time I checked.</i>

149
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,412
Stick of gum, right?

150
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,623
- No?
- No.

151
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,875
Red light, green light.

152
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,212
You come up against a lock you
can't pick, you mash them together...

153
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:33,174
Hasta lasagna, don't get any on ya.

154
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,260
You'll have about five seconds.

155
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,639
Just don't chew it.

156
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,221
Ethan, Jack's inside.

157
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:21,973
Let's go.

158
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,146
<i>How do you do, senator?</i>

159
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,772
<i>I'm rand housman,
the ambassador's aide.</i>

160
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,566
<i>- Hello, Mr. housman.
- How was the opera?</i>

161
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,861
Uh, it was boring.

162
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,572
Let me see if I can steer you
through this reception line.

163
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:50,084
<i>- How do you do, senator?
- His wife, Mrs. Reid.</i>

164
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:52,003
Windows open by 2300.

165
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,505
- Petr Brandi, the mayor of Prague.
- How do you do, sir?

166
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:56,174
And Mrs. Brandi.

167
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,595
I bet you don't remember me, do you?

168
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:03,014
Why, of course I do.
How are you, miss Norman?

169
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,475
He's in pocket, on the stairway.

170
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,899
Mr. golitsyn, nice to see you.

171
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:15,944
Hannah...

172
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:20,698
<i>Pull the shade.</i>

173
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,628
<i>Sarah, mark the package
and go to tunnel.</i>

174
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,095
Your advance team mentioned
that you'd like a tour of the facilities

175
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,389
so I've gone ahead and set one up.
Excuse me.

176
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:45,723
This way. Thank you.

177
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,945
Oh, great.

178
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,656
...which leads to the denied area

179
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:05,076
which is the only limited-access area
in the whole facility.

180
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:31,519
Governor's in position now.

181
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:43,781
- Excuse me. Can I help you?
-L'm sorry.

182
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:47,327
As you can see, there's a marine guard
and video surveillance

183
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,787
and this place is like...
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

184
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:51,664
I know it's in here somewhere.

185
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:55,084
Now, sergeant, why are you not
in your uniform this evening?

186
00:13:56,294 --> 00:14:00,006
We've been ordered to wear
civilian clothes this evening, sir.

187
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:02,925
Be right back.

188
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:07,889
Tell me, senator, do you not have
someone on your staff named Jack?

189
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:11,726
<i>Jack?
Well, I think we did have a Jack.</i>

190
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:15,271
An unreliable fellow,
as I recall, constantly late,

191
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,190
<i>behind in his work.</i>

192
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:23,154
<i>We were forced to tie him behind
one of my best stallions</i>

193
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,364
and drag him around

194
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:26,324
<i>my barn for a few days.</i>

195
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,868
Relax your crap, foghorn.
I'm working on it.

196
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,883
Sorry, sir.

197
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,593
- Thank you.
- Have a nice evening.

198
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:46,677
Thank you.

199
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:47,970
Ah.

200
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:01,526
That date with Sarah is definitely off.

201
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:31,764
Higher.

202
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:39,564
He's heading to the denied area.

203
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,317
<i>Get moving, Ethan.</i>

204
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:44,819
He's rolling to you.

205
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:56,539
Jack.

206
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:00,376
Jack, we're in position here.

207
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,172
- Jack.
- I didn't touch it.

208
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:09,177
What about my coat?
I'm going to freeze.

209
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,511
Jack, open the doors.

210
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,565
He's in the box, Ethan. He's in the box.

211
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,442
Okay.

212
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:25,860
We're taking golitsyn's exit.

213
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,653
- Open these doors.
- I don't have it.

214
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:32,074
I'm opening the doors. Go under.

215
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:35,578
Go.

216
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,328
- He's got it.
- All right.

217
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,541
- Saved your ass again, Jack.
<i>- Give</i> me a break, <i>pops.</i>

218
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,543
Such a nice ass.

219
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,628
And a lonely ass.

220
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:29,423
- Transport in five minutes.
- Yes, indeed.

221
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,969
Jack, we're in position.
Open the doors and let the package roll.

222
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:17,430
Roger that. Opening doors now.

223
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,349
Stairway, you're wrapped.

224
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,059
<i>Go to transport.</i>

225
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:29,150
Hey.

226
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,322
- Jack, what are you doing?
-L'm not doing anything.

227
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:42,330
I don't have control, Jack.

228
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:45,249
- Then I got a problem.
- Cut the power.

229
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,212
- Cut the power, Jack.
- Come on, Jack.

230
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,257
- Cut the power.
- Jack?

231
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:55,551
Jack?

232
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,434
<i>Ethan'. Jack?</i>

233
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:06,771
Jack?

234
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:09,649
Jack?

235
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:12,443
<i>Jack, do you copy?</i>

236
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:14,987
- Jack?
- Man down, Ethan.

237
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,239
<i>Man down.</i>

238
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,803
<i>Ethan, stay where you are.</i>

239
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,055
I'm coming to you.

240
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:57,988
The package is out in the open.

241
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,119
Jim,

242
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,830
<i>he's in the open.</i>

243
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:06,956
En route.

244
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:28,144
Jim, he's in the open.

245
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:32,523
Jim, the package is in the open.

246
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,822
- L've got a shadow.
- Can you lose him?

247
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,657
No. Abort.

248
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,451
Ethan, he's out of pocket.

249
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:49,749
I can't do that.

250
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:52,793
We're being ambushed, Ethan. Abort.
That's an order.

251
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:55,504
Negative. Golitsyn is on the move.

252
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,798
<i>No, damn it! No! I said abort!</i>

253
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:10,478
Sarah, eye on the package.
Jim, I'm coming to you.

254
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:12,438
Jim gave an abort.
We should walk away.

255
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:16,275
No. We are going to recover that disk.
You understand me?

256
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,569
Now, go.

257
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:51,977
Where are you?

258
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,271
About 200 yards from the bridge.

259
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,648
<i>They're covering this frequency.</i>

260
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,316
Cut all radio communication.

261
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,653
<i>Repeat. Cut all radio communication.</i>

262
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:26,846
<i>Ethan!</i>

263
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:34,770
<i>Ethan...</i>

264
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:01,881
Sarah, abort.

265
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,049
Repeat, abort.

266
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:08,721
Abort!

267
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,264
Do you read me?

268
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:16,562
Sarah? God!

269
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:50,346
Claire. Oh, my god.

270
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:52,431
My god.

271
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:42,940
Oh, no. Sarah.

272
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:39,663
My god.

273
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:41,915
Satcom seven.

274
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,294
- Central Europe, unsecured.
- Designator?

275
00:25:45,836 --> 00:25:48,672
- Bravo-echo-one-one.
- Switching.

276
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:53,510
<i>- This is kittridge.
- Go secure.</i>

277
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,512
<i>Okay, go ahead.</i>

278
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,641
This is Ethan hunt. They're dead.

279
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:02,978
<i>What? Who's dead?</i>

280
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:05,814
- My team. My team is dead!
- Jesus.

281
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:07,858
Golitsyn's gone.

282
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,443
They knew we were coming, man.

283
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:12,237
They knew we were coming,
and the disk is gone.

284
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:13,697
<i>Are you intact?</i>

285
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:17,409
The disk is gone, did you...
Do you read me? The list is in the open!

286
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:18,869
<i>Listen, I read you.</i>

287
00:26:19,453 --> 00:26:22,456
<i>Let's just bring you in safely
and then we'll worry about that, okay?</i>

288
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,666
<i>Were you followed?</i>

289
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:30,380
- I <i>don't think so.</i> I <i>don't think so.
- don 't think. Be sure.</i>

290
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:33,383
<i>- Are you clean?
- Yes.</i>

291
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:37,763
<i>Okay. Location green, one hour.
I'll be there myself.</i>

292
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:41,475
- You're in Prague?
- One <i>hour.</i>

293
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:38,782
Kittridgei lam...

294
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,453
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

295
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:48,208
I know how much Jim,
in particular, meant to you, Ethan,

296
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:51,295
personally as well as professionally.

297
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:53,714
Yeah.

298
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,972
Here's a passport, visa. Usual drill.

299
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:05,809
We'll work the exfiltration
through Canada, debrief you at Langley.

300
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:08,312
Throw the Prague police a bone or two.

301
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,480
You know, toss them a few suspects.

302
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,069
You follow me?

303
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,281
Yeah, I follow.

304
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,785
I think we've lost enough agents
for one night.

305
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:27,748
You mean, I've lost enough agents
for one night.

306
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:32,002
You seem hell-bent
on blaming yourself, Ethan.

307
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:35,088
Who else is left?

308
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:39,885
Yeah. I see your point.

309
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:46,600
Why was there another team?

310
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:48,977
What?

311
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,315
Of imf agents at the embassy tonight.

312
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:56,985
I don't quite follow you.

313
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:02,866
Well, see if you can follow me
around the room.

314
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,495
The drunk Russians on the embankment
at seven and 8 o'clock,

315
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:13,043
the couple waltzing around me
at the embassy at nine and 11.

316
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:15,963
The waiter standing behind Hannah
at the top of the stairs.

317
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:17,589
Bow tie, 120' clock.

318
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,633
The other imf team.

319
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:23,845
You're worried about me. Why?

320
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:28,350
Well, for a little over two years,

321
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:32,271
we've been spotting serious blowback
in imf operations.

322
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:33,981
We have a penetration.

323
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:37,192
The other day, we decoded a message
on the Internet

324
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:39,528
from a Czech we know as Max.

325
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:42,447
- The arms dealer.
- That's right.

326
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:46,285
Max, it seems, has two unique gifts,

327
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:50,956
a capacity for anonymity
and for corrupting susceptible agents.

328
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:54,293
This time, he'd gotten to someone
on the inside.

329
00:29:55,252 --> 00:29:57,754
He'd gotten himself
in a position to buy our noc list.

330
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:00,882
An operation he referred to as job 314,

331
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:03,927
the job he thought
golitsyn was doing tonight.

332
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:09,182
But the list golitsyn stole was a decoy.

333
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:14,229
That's correct.
The actual list is secure at Langley.

334
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:16,815
Golitsyn was a lightning rod.
He was one of ours.

335
00:30:19,276 --> 00:30:23,405
This whole operation was a mole hunt.

336
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:31,621
This whole operation was a mole hunt.

337
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:33,457
Yeah.

338
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:38,337
The mole's deep inside

339
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:42,341
and like you said

340
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:47,471
you survived.

341
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,142
I want to show you something, Ethan.

342
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,646
Since your father's death,

343
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:59,775
your family's farm has been
in receivership

344
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:04,279
and now, suddenly, they're flush
with over 120 grand in the bank.

345
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:07,949
Your father's illness was supposed
to have wiped out that bank account.

346
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:14,081
Dying slowly in America, after all,
can be a very expensive proposition.

347
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:17,167
So...

348
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:22,339
Why don't we quietly get out of here
and onto a plane?

349
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,010
I can understand you're very upset.

350
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:30,013
Kittridge, you've
never seen me very upset.

351
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,766
All right, hunt. Enough is enough.

352
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:35,185
You have bribed, cajoled, and killed.

353
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:37,437
And you have done it using loyalties
on the inside.

354
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:39,606
You want to shake hands with the devil,
that's fine with me.

355
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,525
L just want to make sure
that you do it in hell.

356
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:46,107
Money, money.
Where's the damn money?

357
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:15,303
<i>The other day, we decoded
a message on the Internet</i>

358
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:17,764
<i>from a Czech we know as Max.</i>

359
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:21,810
<i>He'd gotten himself
in a position to buy our noc list.</i>

360
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,604
<i>An operation he referred to as job 314.</i>

361
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:32,821
<i>Job 314.</i>

362
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:43,665
Job 314. I can't...

363
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,349
Job...

364
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:22,579
<i>Job 3214'?</i>

365
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,789
<i>Job 3214.</i>

366
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:48,146
You son of a bitch.

367
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:13,129
Max, goods tainted.

368
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:18,009
Consider extremely hazardous.
Do not use.

369
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:24,432
Fate will be that of kings
and counselors...

370
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:31,773
Must meet to discuss asap.

371
00:37:27,704 --> 00:37:28,955
Ethan,

372
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:32,876
what are you doing?

373
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:38,214
I needed you, Ethan.
I needed you on the bridge,

374
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:42,385
but you weren't there.

375
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:46,765
Ethan.

376
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:50,268
Ethan.

377
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:52,687
Ethan?

378
00:37:58,568 --> 00:37:59,944
Don't move.

379
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,530
Ethan.

380
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:06,075
Ethan, it's okay. Just calm down.

381
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:07,994
It's Claire.

382
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:10,872
- It's okay.
- You were in the car.

383
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:13,666
No, I wasn't.

384
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,003
I heard on the radio...

385
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:20,340
Shut up, I saw you. You were in the car.

386
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,092
No, I got out of the car.

387
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:26,179
I ran to the bridge.
He said someone was just...

388
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:29,140
Don't give me that. I was on the bridge.

389
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:32,018
- There was nobody on the bridge.
- What happened to Jim?

390
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:34,521
Wake up, Claire! Jim's dead!

391
00:38:34,938 --> 00:38:36,981
They're dead! They're all dead!

392
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,700
- Who sent you for me?
- Jim's dead?

393
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:50,119
- Who sent you here?
- Jim...

394
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:52,997
Take off your coat.

395
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:03,758
- Where were you, huh?
-|...

396
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:07,679
Where were you?

397
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:13,142
I walked away. He said abort.
I just walked away.

398
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:15,728
That was four hours ago.
Who sent you?

399
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:17,939
- Did they send you for me?
- Who's "they"?

400
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,649
Did they send you?

401
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:21,651
Look, who sent you? Who sent you?

402
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,903
No one sent me. No one sent me.

403
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:26,072
We were supposed to be
back here at 4:00.

404
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:30,994
4:00 if we abort.
We don't return here until 4:00, 0400.

405
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:34,080
4:00 A.M. 4:00, Ethan, 4:00.

406
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:36,457
If we abort.

407
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,085
4:00 A.M.

408
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:00,398
I've been disavowed.

409
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:09,574
They actually think I killed Jim
and everyone else.

410
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:20,126
Somehow $100,000 finds its way
into my parents' bank account.

411
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:23,087
Kittridge assumes I'm the mole
they've been tracing,

412
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:26,549
and I've been in the employ
of an arms dealer, Max,

413
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:28,009
for the last two years

414
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,304
to get him our noc list.

415
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:34,223
What are you gonna do?

416
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:36,559
I'm gonna get it for him.

417
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:40,855
Ethan, you're not making any sense.

418
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:44,067
Whoever the mole is,

419
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:46,611
I think goes by the name of job.

420
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:50,031
I can't find him, but if he knows
i have the noc list,

421
00:40:51,908 --> 00:40:53,117
he'll find me.

422
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:55,995
I'm gonna go in and I'm gonna talk
to kittridge myself.

423
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,373
And I'm gonna tell him
you had nothing to do with this.

424
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,667
Claire, if you're not dead,

425
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:04,379
he's gonna assume you're with me.

426
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,521
The message is for job.

427
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:27,485
That's right,
and I'm gonna answer it.

428
00:41:50,717 --> 00:41:51,759
Excuse me.

429
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,929
Can I trouble you for a match?

430
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:13,406
Would you remove your hat, please?

431
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:19,954
- Why?
- You wish to meet Max?

432
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,790
The price of admission.

433
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:36,220
- I thought I was going to see Max.
- You misunderstood.

434
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:37,805
No one sees Max.

435
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,059
Then what the hell
am I doing here?

436
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:45,897
Allowing Max to see you
and hear what you've got to say.

437
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,816
Well, I don't communicate
very well through a shroud.

438
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:52,111
Well, if Max doesn't like
what you have to say,

439
00:42:52,195 --> 00:42:55,615
you'll be wearing
that shroud indefinitely.

440
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:59,077
I'm willing to take the chance.

441
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:06,000
Very well.

442
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:13,966
Who are you and what are you doing here?

443
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:18,179
I need $150,000.

444
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:21,015
On, really?

445
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:28,064
And you thought

446
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:30,650
if you simply showed up,
i might give it to you?

447
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:34,278
Why not? You gave job $125,000.

448
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:40,618
Hmm, the penny drops. You are not job.

449
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:47,416
Job is not given to quoting scripture
in his communications.

450
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:52,755
Then there was its tone,
aggressive but playful.

451
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:54,799
Job is not playful.

452
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:59,512
So you are something of a paradox.

453
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:02,723
- Well, that depends.
- On what?

454
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,434
Whether you like a paradox.

455
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:10,606
I want $150,000 today.

456
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:12,984
No, no.
That's quite out of the question.

457
00:44:15,695 --> 00:44:18,990
The disk job sold you, it's worthless.

458
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:22,660
It's bait, part of an internal
mole hunt.

459
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:30,126
And how might you know that?

460
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:34,046
Are you another company man?

461
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:38,634
- Like job?
- Mmm.

462
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:44,182
We're asking about you.

463
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:47,727
I'm noc. Was.

464
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:50,730
Now, disavowed.

465
00:44:51,898 --> 00:44:53,232
Why, may I ask?

466
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:56,235
That is the question I want to ask job.

467
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:02,074
I don't know job any more
than job knows me.

468
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:03,701
Even so.

469
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:06,204
I'm sure you could arrange
an introduction.

470
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:07,538
Why should I?

471
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:10,374
Because I can deliver
the actual noc list.

472
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:11,918
The one you have is
not only worthless,

473
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:13,794
it's certain to be equipped
with a homing device

474
00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:15,796
to pinpoint your exact location.

475
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:17,256
Mmm-hmm.

476
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,301
Mmm-hmm.

477
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:22,595
Boot it up.

478
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,931
In anywhere from 30 seconds
to 10 minutes...

479
00:45:25,014 --> 00:45:28,059
You'll have Virginia farm boys
hopping around you like jackrabbits.

480
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:33,731
It's easy to say the disk is worthless

481
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:36,108
when you say I can't look
at the information

482
00:45:36,192 --> 00:45:39,987
and see if it's worthless.
Not a tenable position, sir.

483
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:44,158
Okay, use it.

484
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:47,328
But I'd suggest you pack first.

485
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:05,763
26, 27. So far, so good.

486
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:08,391
Not so good for you, my friend.

487
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:10,893
I'd say you've got about two minutes.

488
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:44,885
Matthiasi 32 and 33.

489
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:48,097
Doesn't mean it's a signal.
Could just be the hard drive heating up.

490
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,315
Matthiasi 44 and 45.

491
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:13,664
Now.

492
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:47,907
Man's gone black, Barnes.

493
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:51,327
He's under until he decides to surface.

494
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:52,953
Look, we can use somebody
at the embassy.

495
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:54,288
Involve the local authorities.

496
00:47:54,372 --> 00:47:58,125
- We can cut off his transportation...
- What can we do, Barnes?

497
00:47:58,209 --> 00:48:00,044
Put a guy at the airport?

498
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:02,296
How many identities
do you think hunt has?

499
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,298
How many times has
he slipped past customs

500
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:06,217
in how many countries?

501
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:08,719
These guys are trained to be ghosts.

502
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,555
We taught them to do it,
for Christ's sake.

503
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:13,224
Well, what do you suggest?

504
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:18,771
Let's not waste time chasing after him,
just make him come to us.

505
00:48:19,397 --> 00:48:21,148
Everybody has pressure points, Barnes.

506
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:24,402
You find something
that's personally important to him

507
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:26,070
and you squeeze.

508
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:34,703
Gunther will never let me have
one of his apartments again.

509
00:48:36,664 --> 00:48:40,668
Sorry I doubted you, dear boy.
You are a good sport.

510
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,169
Thanks, Max.

511
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:45,548
Or is it Maxine?

512
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:48,134
I don't have to tell you

513
00:48:48,217 --> 00:48:51,137
what a comfort anonymity can be
in my profession.

514
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,682
It's like a warm blanket.

515
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:01,856
My deal with job was subject
to a successful boot scan.

516
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:04,358
Obviously it didn't pass muster.
Deal's off.

517
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:07,736
What was your deal with job?

518
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,239
Um, $6 million.

519
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:14,285
I'll give you the same,
but I want the complete list now,

520
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:15,786
not just eastern Europe.

521
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:17,872
I won't do this piecemeal.
It's too dangerous.

522
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:20,541
- I want the entire list.
-$10 million.

523
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:24,128
$10 million in negotiable
us treasury certificates

524
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:26,297
in bearer form, coupons attached.

525
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:28,466
And one more thing.

526
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:35,181
Your personal assurance
that job will be at the exchange.

527
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:37,016
Hmm.

528
00:49:48,277 --> 00:49:49,278
Oh.

529
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,282
Max made a deal with you?

530
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:57,703
I deliver the noc list,
Max delivers job.

531
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:05,377
We've got 75 rounds for your beretta
but only 20 for the sig sauer.

532
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:08,506
One pair of visco glasses
with monitor,

533
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:11,050
plenty of passports, and...

534
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:17,056
What?

535
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:19,934
You said it yourself.

536
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:22,311
If I'm not dead, I'm with you.

537
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:25,314
Are you sure about this?

538
00:50:26,232 --> 00:50:27,816
Jim was my husband.

539
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:30,611
I want to get the son of a bitch
who did this.

540
00:50:33,072 --> 00:50:34,573
We're gonna need some help.

541
00:50:34,657 --> 00:50:37,451
We don't have a lot of time,
so they're gonna have to be local.

542
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,286
What kind of help?

543
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:15,155
Simple game.

544
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:17,449
Four players.

545
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,702
Exfil opens the pocket.

546
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:21,537
Cyber ops lifts the wallet.

547
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:24,123
Bank?

548
00:51:24,832 --> 00:51:26,125
Imf mainframe.

549
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:29,211
Where exactly is it?

550
00:51:29,295 --> 00:51:30,588
In Langley.

551
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:35,050
In Langley?

552
00:51:36,385 --> 00:51:38,012
The one in Virginia, Langley?

553
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:42,099
Inside CIA headquarters at Langley?

554
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:44,727
Is he serious?

555
00:51:45,686 --> 00:51:47,688
Always.

556
00:51:48,856 --> 00:51:53,027
If we're going to Virginia,
why don't we drop by fort Knox?

557
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:55,863
I can fly a helicopter right in
through the lobby

558
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,406
and set it down inside the vault,

559
00:51:57,489 --> 00:52:01,535
and it would be a hell of a lot easier
than breaking into the goddamn CIA.

560
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:02,953
What are we downloading?

561
00:52:03,746 --> 00:52:05,539
-Information.
- What kind?

562
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:06,790
Profitable.

563
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,752
Payment on delivery.

564
00:52:12,338 --> 00:52:13,380
I don't know.

565
00:52:14,715 --> 00:52:15,966
I just don't know.

566
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:21,138
This doesn't sound like
the Luther stickell I heard of.

567
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:24,600
What did they used to call you,
the net ranger?

568
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:26,477
Phineas phreak?

569
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:30,397
The only man alive
who actually hacked NATO ghost com.

570
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:33,942
There was never any physical evidence
that I had anything to do with that.

571
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:36,278
With that...

572
00:52:37,446 --> 00:52:39,740
That exceptional piece of work.

573
00:52:43,786 --> 00:52:45,079
You don't know what you're missing.

574
00:52:46,372 --> 00:52:51,085
- This is the mount Everest of hacks.
- Y'all are kidding yourselves.

575
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:55,881
Even with top of the line crypto,
cray access, stu-ill...

576
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:58,092
Krieger can get it, right?

577
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:01,345
May take a little time.

578
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:02,971
What the hell do you mean,
"a little time"?

579
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:05,182
That's not what Claire tells me
about you.

580
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,851
Thinking-machine laptops.

581
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:12,189
I'm talking about the 686 prototypes

582
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:15,234
with the artificial intelligence
risc chip.

583
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:16,402
24 hours.

584
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:22,825
And I get to keep the equipment
when we're done.

585
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:25,411
Luther, I guess you're
all out of excuses.

586
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:29,289
Hmm.

587
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:34,461
Look, I just can't hack my way inside.

588
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:38,549
See, there's no modem access
to the mainframe.

589
00:53:39,383 --> 00:53:41,260
It's in what we call the stand-alone,

590
00:53:41,677 --> 00:53:45,723
which means I'd have to be physically
at the terminal.

591
00:53:46,974 --> 00:53:48,267
Relax, Luther.

592
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:50,519
It's much worse than you think.

593
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:53,981
The terminal is
in a black vault lockdown.

594
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:56,150
<i>The only person allowed in the room</i>

595
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:58,902
<i>has to pass through a series
of security checks.</i>

596
00:53:58,986 --> 00:54:00,362
William donloe.

597
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:05,117
<i>The first is a voiceprint identification
and a six-digit access code.</i>

598
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:10,789
<i>This only gets him into the outer room.</i>

599
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:14,168
<i>Next, he has to pass a retinal scan.</i>

600
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:21,258
<i>And finally,
the intrusion countermeasures</i>

601
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:24,720
<i>are only deactivated
by a double-electronic keycard</i>

602
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:26,555
which we won't have.

603
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:31,268
<i>Now, inside the black vault</i>

604
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:33,145
<i>there are three systems operating...</i>

605
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:35,439
<i>Whenever the technician
is out of the room.</i>

606
00:54:36,315 --> 00:54:40,402
<i>The first is sound-sensitive.
Anything above a whisper sets it off.</i>

607
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:44,948
<i>The second system
detects any increase in temperature.</i>

608
00:54:45,574 --> 00:54:48,160
<i>Even the body heat
of an unauthorized person in the room</i>

609
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:51,580
<i>will trigger it if the temperature rises
just a single degree.</i>

610
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:59,797
<i>Now, that temperature is controlled
by the air conditioning</i>

611
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:03,050
<i>coming in through an overhead duct,
30 feet above the floor.</i>

612
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:06,845
<i>That vent is guarded by a laser net.</i>

613
00:55:11,934 --> 00:55:14,728
<i>The third system is on the floor,
and is pressure-sensitive.</i>

614
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:19,399
<i>The slightest increase in weight
will trigger the alarm.</i>

615
00:55:20,901 --> 00:55:22,945
<i>And any one of these systems,
if set off...</i>

616
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:25,572
<i>Will activate an automatic lockdown.</i>

617
00:55:27,074 --> 00:55:29,701
<i>Now, believe me
when I tell you, gentlemen...</i>

618
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:33,497
<i>All three systems are state-of-the-art.</i>

619
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:39,795
And you really think we can do this?

620
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:44,967
We're going to do it.

621
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:20,627
We picked up alarms
in sector 3, 7, and 12.

622
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:23,422
<i>Yeah, that's what I've got, too.
What sector's the air conditioning?</i>

623
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:26,091
<i>21, but there's no alarm
in sector 21.</i>

624
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:28,010
<i>No, I gotta get in there
and shut it down.</i>

625
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:29,761
<i>I 'm sorry,
but nobody gets into any sector...</i>

626
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:30,888
<i>Where an alarm hasn't gone off.</i>

627
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:32,806
<i>You wanna blow the fire
through this whole building?</i>

628
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:35,517
<i>Look, no one goes into any sector
where the alarm hasn't gone off...</i>

629
00:56:35,601 --> 00:56:37,686
<i>-And it hasn't gone off in 21.
- Wait.</i>

630
00:56:42,858 --> 00:56:44,318
<i>It's gone off. Let's go.</i>

631
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:45,402
Let's move.

632
00:56:57,915 --> 00:57:00,250
- Can I get you anything?
- No, thank you.

633
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:04,588
21's through here.

634
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:13,472
He's recruiting.

635
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:14,681
For what purpose?

636
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:15,766
Survival.

637
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:19,353
Too shortsighted. This guy initiates.
He's proactive.

638
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:22,814
The question is, what does he want?
Where does he need to get it?

639
00:57:22,898 --> 00:57:25,275
And Barnes, what the hell's that noise?

640
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:27,778
Uh, fire alarm, gene.

641
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:32,616
Do we have to evacuate?

642
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:23,083
Hey, there were three of you.
Where's the other guy?

643
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:27,879
Krieger! Zero body count.

644
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:29,881
We'll see.

645
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:04,476
Hi there.

646
01:01:05,412 --> 01:01:09,457
One, two, three.

647
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:12,669
Toast. Toast.

648
01:01:13,545 --> 01:01:15,589
- Check.
- Good.

649
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:19,217
Okay, Luther, I'm going in.

650
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:22,262
<i>Everest, man.
You ready to plant the flag?</i>

651
01:01:31,146 --> 01:01:32,272
Damn.

652
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:36,234
Krieger, from here on in,
absolute silence.

653
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:53,812
He's rolling to you.

654
01:02:58,358 --> 01:03:00,068
He's at the voiceprint corridor.

655
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:01,486
William donloe.

656
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:18,753
Outer room.

657
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:24,843
He's coming in the vault.

658
01:03:31,099 --> 01:03:32,142
Come on, move.

659
01:05:01,064 --> 01:05:02,482
He's in the bathroom.

660
01:06:20,268 --> 01:06:22,520
A-w-9...

661
01:06:22,896 --> 01:06:25,148
<i>6-b-6.</i>

662
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:46,002
Holy mother of god.

663
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:47,962
<i>The noc list.</i>

664
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:46,974
He's at the vault.

665
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:02,073
Four yellows.

666
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:06,452
One red.

667
01:10:17,839 --> 01:10:18,923
Get moving.

668
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:21,467
Toast.

669
01:10:23,177 --> 01:10:24,178
Toast.

670
01:10:27,014 --> 01:10:29,267
<i>Qgrunts) Merci.</i>

671
01:11:27,158 --> 01:11:28,326
Oh, my god.

672
01:11:39,837 --> 01:11:40,838
Yeah.

673
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:46,093
It's for you.

674
01:11:48,054 --> 01:11:49,180
Kittridge.

675
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:16,624
You and I know about this.
That's where it stops, you understand?

676
01:12:16,707 --> 01:12:18,334
It never happened.

677
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:19,418
What about him?

678
01:12:20,294 --> 01:12:23,840
I want him Manning a radar tower
in Alaska by the end of the day.

679
01:12:23,923 --> 01:12:25,341
Just mail him his clothes.

680
01:13:04,589 --> 01:13:05,798
You contacting your buyer?

681
01:13:08,092 --> 01:13:09,135
Ethan.

682
01:13:15,308 --> 01:13:16,475
Ethan.

683
01:13:23,274 --> 01:13:24,275
Ethan.

684
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:26,652
Oh.

685
01:13:27,278 --> 01:13:29,363
Excuse me. Mr. hunt.

686
01:13:39,373 --> 01:13:41,292
You're not going to any meeting
without me.

687
01:13:44,045 --> 01:13:46,672
My contact is extremely shy.

688
01:13:49,133 --> 01:13:52,219
I don't think you're in any position
to give orders. Do you?

689
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:55,473
Not while I'm holding this.

690
01:13:55,973 --> 01:13:57,934
- Krieger. ..
- Ta gueule.

691
01:14:03,606 --> 01:14:04,649
Don't you mean this?

692
01:14:05,775 --> 01:14:06,984
That's not the list.

693
01:14:07,652 --> 01:14:10,321
Oh, what's the matter?
You, you've never seen this trick?

694
01:14:18,579 --> 01:14:19,622
Where'd it go?

695
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:25,294
It's gone.

696
01:14:26,796 --> 01:14:27,880
What?

697
01:14:28,589 --> 01:14:29,632
- You.
- No.

698
01:14:29,715 --> 01:14:30,716
No?

699
01:14:31,801 --> 01:14:32,802
Oh...

700
01:14:37,556 --> 01:14:38,891
But not too far.

701
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:44,689
I know what you're thinking, Krieger.

702
01:14:45,815 --> 01:14:47,483
You're thinking,
"back in the computer room...

703
01:14:47,566 --> 01:14:50,069
"I was up here, he was down there.

704
01:14:52,947 --> 01:14:54,240
"Yes, and he was...

705
01:14:55,783 --> 01:14:58,035
"He was carrying two disks."

706
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:02,415
It's so hard
to keep track of these things.

707
01:15:03,624 --> 01:15:04,667
Where is it?

708
01:15:20,016 --> 01:15:22,601
Do you actually think
I'd let you have the noc list?

709
01:15:24,395 --> 01:15:26,897
Try any sleight of hand with my money,
I'll cut your throat.

710
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:57,303
<i>You're off on one of your cushy
recruiting assignments again?</i>

711
01:15:57,386 --> 01:15:59,597
<i>Yeah, where'd they put you up
this time, the Plaza?</i>

712
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:01,098
<i>Drake hotel, Chicago.</i>

713
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:05,394
I'm so sorry.

714
01:16:12,318 --> 01:16:13,652
Krieger was my call.

715
01:16:20,701 --> 01:16:21,911
I'm sorry, Ethan.

716
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:28,834
We did what we had to do.

717
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:33,380
I'm going to try and get some sleep.

718
01:17:12,795 --> 01:17:14,463
Krieger did have the noc list?

719
01:17:24,682 --> 01:17:26,016
Now I want you to hold on to it.

720
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:27,226
What makes you trust me?

721
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:29,603
Because if you knew
what you were getting into...

722
01:17:29,687 --> 01:17:30,688
You never would have done it.

723
01:17:36,944 --> 01:17:39,071
I'm not going to let this
get out in the open.

724
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:42,908
Exactly. That's your job tomorrow,
on the train.

725
01:17:44,118 --> 01:17:45,995
Don't let this noc list
get out in the open.

726
01:17:53,627 --> 01:17:54,837
What is the range of this thing?

727
01:17:56,213 --> 01:17:59,049
It's hard to tell.
I'm gonna have to be close.

728
01:18:00,843 --> 01:18:02,261
Ethan, I need to talk to you.

729
01:18:03,888 --> 01:18:07,266
The unlikely setting,
a <i>farm in the heartland of America...</i>

730
01:18:07,349 --> 01:18:08,893
<i>The state of Wisconsin...</i>

731
01:18:08,976 --> 01:18:10,978
<i>Where federal agents claim to have found</i>

732
01:18:11,061 --> 01:18:13,647
<i>the brains behind
an international drugs ring.</i>

733
01:18:13,731 --> 01:18:17,276
<i>The operation was masterminded
by Margaret Ethan hunt</i>

734
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:19,612
<i>and her brother-in-law, Donald hunt.</i>

735
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:22,990
<i>They were arrested this morning
by drug enforcement officers</i>

736
01:18:23,073 --> 01:18:24,575
<i>in a major sting operation</i>

737
01:18:24,658 --> 01:18:27,620
<i>designed to expose
the illegal manufacture</i>

738
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:30,331
<i>of the drug methcathinone,
known as khat.</i>

739
01:18:30,414 --> 01:18:33,417
<i>I'm afraid what we have here is
a case of a naive and lonely widower...</i>

740
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:34,543
Kittridge.

741
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:04,573
Kittridge.

742
01:19:04,657 --> 01:19:06,700
I see you've been out
visiting the folks.

743
01:19:07,493 --> 01:19:09,119
It's hunt.
What do you need for a pinpoint?

744
01:19:10,454 --> 01:19:13,624
You've been watching a little TV,
have you?

745
01:19:15,125 --> 01:19:18,921
Hauling mom off to jail in shackles
was an especially nice touch.

746
01:19:19,171 --> 01:19:20,965
- He's in england.
- Get ml5.

747
01:19:21,674 --> 01:19:23,133
Ethan, I wanna assure you

748
01:19:23,217 --> 01:19:26,679
that my first order of business
after you come in

749
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:30,224
is to have these ridiculous charges
against your family dropped

750
01:19:30,307 --> 01:19:33,143
and eliminated completely
from their files.

751
01:19:33,227 --> 01:19:35,646
Look, if you come in now,

752
01:19:35,729 --> 01:19:39,066
<i>we can plea down
the charges against you, as well.</i>

753
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:42,861
Can I ask you something, kittridge?

754
01:19:44,571 --> 01:19:45,948
Certainly, Ethan.

755
01:19:46,365 --> 01:19:48,117
If you're dealing with someone...

756
01:19:49,493 --> 01:19:51,662
<i>Who's crushed, stabbed...</i>

757
01:19:52,246 --> 01:19:54,707
Shot, and detonated...

758
01:19:55,291 --> 01:19:58,168
<i>Five members of his own imf team...</i>

759
01:19:59,545 --> 01:20:01,630
How devastated
do you think you're gonna make him

760
01:20:01,714 --> 01:20:04,925
by marching ma and uncle Donald
down to the county courthouse?

761
01:20:05,009 --> 01:20:08,262
<i>I don't know, Ethan.
Why don't you tell me?</i>

762
01:20:11,348 --> 01:20:12,391
Lost him.

763
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:15,769
We needed three more seconds.

764
01:20:15,853 --> 01:20:18,397
He wanted us to know he was in London.

765
01:20:32,328 --> 01:20:33,871
You're a hard man to catch up with.

766
01:20:43,213 --> 01:20:45,716
Next day I managed to drag myself
back to the safe house.

767
01:20:45,799 --> 01:20:47,009
I must have just missed you.

768
01:20:47,134 --> 01:20:50,220
Anyway, I checked our aliases.

769
01:20:50,346 --> 01:20:51,889
And that's when you picked us up
in the states.

770
01:20:52,348 --> 01:20:55,351
But you left before I could get there,
and I could checkjust so many places.

771
01:20:55,726 --> 01:20:58,187
Smaller countries don't computerize
customs records.

772
01:20:58,270 --> 01:20:59,605
So I watched Europe.

773
01:21:00,481 --> 01:21:03,567
Once you turned up in england,
it was easy.

774
01:21:04,234 --> 01:21:06,362
You knew
i liked the rentals at liverpool street.

775
01:21:06,445 --> 01:21:08,322
Hey, I showed them to you.

776
01:21:10,199 --> 01:21:11,283
I remember.

777
01:21:14,078 --> 01:21:16,663
Jim, look, who do you think
you're kidding here?

778
01:21:16,747 --> 01:21:19,083
A doctor's gotta look at that.
You can't sit up straight.

779
01:21:19,166 --> 01:21:20,667
I can sit up straight.

780
01:21:21,543 --> 01:21:23,128
I just can't sit up straight very well.

781
01:21:23,796 --> 01:21:26,298
Sit down. Sit down. It's not important.

782
01:21:28,258 --> 01:21:29,259
Ethan...

783
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:34,473
I saw who shot me. I saw the mole.

784
01:21:36,517 --> 01:21:39,645
- It was kittridge.
- Kittridge.

785
01:21:40,604 --> 01:21:42,981
Kittridge, Ethan.

786
01:21:47,861 --> 01:21:49,571
Kittridge is the mole.

787
01:21:50,781 --> 01:21:52,449
My god, of course. You're right.

788
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:00,541
He was at the embassy that night.

789
01:22:04,878 --> 01:22:07,923
First, he took out Jack at the elevator.

790
01:22:16,098 --> 01:22:17,599
He shot you on the bridge.

791
01:22:48,005 --> 01:22:49,047
<i>Ethan!</i>

792
01:23:03,228 --> 01:23:06,023
He must have had backup take out
golitsyn and Sarah at the fence.

793
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:26,752
How did he do Hannah?

794
01:23:52,569 --> 01:23:55,531
No. No,
he could have done Hannah himself.

795
01:24:22,724 --> 01:24:23,725
Why, Jim?

796
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:27,104
Why?

797
01:24:30,148 --> 01:24:32,234
When you think about it, Ethan,
it was inevitable.

798
01:24:32,317 --> 01:24:33,527
No more cold war.

799
01:24:35,445 --> 01:24:37,656
No more secrets
you keep from everyone but yourself.

800
01:24:38,490 --> 01:24:40,951
Operations, you answer
to no one but yourself.

801
01:24:42,369 --> 01:24:45,622
And then one day, you wake up,
the President of the United States is

802
01:24:45,706 --> 01:24:47,457
running the country
without your permission.

803
01:24:48,584 --> 01:24:50,377
The son of a bitch, how dare he?

804
01:24:52,004 --> 01:24:53,797
Then you realize, it's over.

805
01:24:54,756 --> 01:24:57,175
You're an obsolete piece of hardware
not worth upgrading.

806
01:24:57,259 --> 01:25:00,345
You've got a lousy marriage
and 62 grand a year.

807
01:25:02,681 --> 01:25:03,682
Kittridge.

808
01:25:04,808 --> 01:25:07,477
We'll go after
the no-good son of a bitch big time.

809
01:25:12,733 --> 01:25:16,486
We won't have to. He'll come after us.

810
01:25:18,030 --> 01:25:19,406
What's gonna make him do that?

811
01:25:20,282 --> 01:25:23,660
What he didn't get in Prague.
The noc list.

812
01:25:26,163 --> 01:25:29,166
Whoa. Jesus, Ethan.

813
01:25:30,917 --> 01:25:33,003
Good for you.

814
01:25:34,171 --> 01:25:36,757
I'm meeting him tomorrow
on the tgv en route to Paris.

815
01:25:37,424 --> 01:25:39,134
Tight security. No guns.

816
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:41,261
A real plus.

817
01:25:42,304 --> 01:25:44,348
If I supposedly deliver the noc list
to Max...

818
01:25:44,431 --> 01:25:46,308
Max has agreed to deliver job to me.

819
01:25:47,017 --> 01:25:49,144
I'll have Claire and Luther stickell
with me on the train.

820
01:25:49,227 --> 01:25:51,647
Krieger is gonna have
helicopter transport waiting in Paris.

821
01:25:55,233 --> 01:25:56,234
Jim?

822
01:26:06,036 --> 01:26:07,829
I was in a café waiting for you, Ethan.

823
01:26:11,541 --> 01:26:12,793
And there she was...

824
01:26:14,294 --> 01:26:17,214
Standing in the rain,
alive and beautiful...

825
01:26:17,673 --> 01:26:19,132
Thinking I'm dead and gone.

826
01:26:23,261 --> 01:26:25,847
God knows what she's had to do
to forget me

827
01:26:25,931 --> 01:26:27,849
to keep going, get the job done.

828
01:26:32,229 --> 01:26:34,189
She can't know about me, Ethan.

829
01:26:34,272 --> 01:26:36,525
No one can, not till this is over.

830
01:26:37,234 --> 01:26:38,235
You're probably right.

831
01:26:39,945 --> 01:26:41,363
There's too much at stake.

832
01:26:43,949 --> 01:26:46,743
Once we leave the safe house, Jim,
you get in there and crash.

833
01:26:48,662 --> 01:26:51,456
<i>-L'll</i> call you from Paris.
- You got it.

834
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:16,231
What happened?

835
01:27:20,569 --> 01:27:22,070
I sent the message to Max.

836
01:27:26,908 --> 01:27:28,034
We're on for tomorrow.

837
01:27:36,209 --> 01:27:37,210
Okay.

838
01:27:48,054 --> 01:27:49,055
Come here.

839
01:28:31,306 --> 01:28:32,390
Sir.

840
01:28:33,308 --> 01:28:35,185
- What's this?
-Lncoming, sir, for you.

841
01:28:35,268 --> 01:28:37,896
X-Ray's clean, electronics,
and no explosives.

842
01:28:49,366 --> 01:28:50,492
Gene?

843
01:28:55,831 --> 01:28:58,667
- How long to the London terminus?
- Twenty, twenty-five minutes.

844
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:00,377
You've got 10 minutes. Move!

845
01:29:38,331 --> 01:29:40,125
<i>- Yes?
- Give me Max.</i>

846
01:29:41,126 --> 01:29:42,127
It's him.

847
01:29:46,089 --> 01:29:47,716
This was not what we discussed.

848
01:29:47,799 --> 01:29:50,343
<i>My apologies, Max.
It couldn't be helped.</i>

849
01:29:51,052 --> 01:29:53,013
<i>There's a piece of black cloth
under your seat.</i>

850
01:29:53,096 --> 01:29:54,598
<i>Tear it away, you'll find the disk.</i>

851
01:30:29,841 --> 01:30:31,468
Dear boy...

852
01:30:32,969 --> 01:30:36,431
I hope this doesn't preclude
a meeting in private.

853
01:30:36,556 --> 01:30:38,516
<i>Not as long as you tell me
where the money is.</i>

854
01:30:39,225 --> 01:30:42,145
The mere possibility is
worth $10 million.

855
01:30:42,228 --> 01:30:44,356
Baggage car, rack 3.

856
01:30:44,522 --> 01:30:48,193
Silver briefcase, combination 3-1-4.

857
01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:50,403
<i>What about job?</i>

858
01:30:50,487 --> 01:30:54,032
Wouldn't worry about him.
When you get the money, he'll find you.

859
01:31:12,050 --> 01:31:13,468
What's the matter?

860
01:31:13,635 --> 01:31:16,137
- It's not transmitting.
- Try it. Try it again.

861
01:31:16,221 --> 01:31:18,682
Damn it, I've got to get this through
before we hit the chunnel.

862
01:31:32,153 --> 01:31:34,614
- What's the problem?
- Connection denied.

863
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:38,451
I can see that.
Did you check the batteries?

864
01:31:38,535 --> 01:31:40,537
I always check the batteries.

865
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:43,289
Don't you give me that.
Run it through from the top.

866
01:31:48,169 --> 01:31:49,170
Kittridgei this is bullshit.

867
01:31:49,254 --> 01:31:50,964
We don't even know what Max looks like.

868
01:31:51,256 --> 01:31:52,924
Look, we don't need to know.

869
01:31:53,299 --> 01:31:55,176
If he's got that list,
he's gonna want to check it.

870
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:56,511
And that means laptops.

871
01:32:08,273 --> 01:32:11,109
Excuse me, sir. Your telephone.

872
01:32:11,192 --> 01:32:13,445
Hello? Hello?

873
01:32:14,988 --> 01:32:16,322
I can't hear anything.

874
01:32:17,866 --> 01:32:20,702
Ls everything all right, sir?
- Lt's just the battery is gone.

875
01:32:20,785 --> 01:32:22,954
It's working.

876
01:32:34,507 --> 01:32:36,051
He's in the baggage car.

877
01:32:38,053 --> 01:32:40,472
Ethan, kittridge is on the train.

878
01:32:40,555 --> 01:32:41,848
<i>I'm right behind you.</i>

879
01:32:41,931 --> 01:32:44,225
<i>The money's in the baggage car.
I'll meet you there.</i>

880
01:33:01,409 --> 01:33:02,494
Barnes?

881
01:33:40,782 --> 01:33:42,242
Ethan's right behind me.

882
01:33:44,744 --> 01:33:48,248
Listen, Jim,
is it such a good idea to kill him?

883
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:53,670
Kittridge is here.

884
01:33:57,924 --> 01:33:59,008
We take the money.

885
01:34:00,093 --> 01:34:01,594
Ethan takes the blame.

886
01:34:04,347 --> 01:34:06,099
No one else has seen you alive.

887
01:34:09,227 --> 01:34:11,062
No one will believe him.

888
01:34:39,215 --> 01:34:40,466
Of course...

889
01:34:40,550 --> 01:34:43,386
I'm very sorry
to hear you say that, Claire.

890
01:34:47,265 --> 01:34:49,017
- Ethan.
- Yes.

891
01:34:50,476 --> 01:34:52,979
Ethan hunt, darling.
You remember him, don't you?

892
01:34:55,940 --> 01:34:58,651
- You knew about Jim?
- Of course.

893
01:35:01,362 --> 01:35:04,073
Just exactly when he knew
is something of a question.

894
01:35:04,157 --> 01:35:05,408
Mind telling me, Ethan?

895
01:35:06,826 --> 01:35:08,578
Before or after I showed up in London?

896
01:35:10,079 --> 01:35:11,331
Before London...

897
01:35:11,789 --> 01:35:14,751
But after you took the Bible
from the Drake hotel in Chicago.

898
01:35:16,211 --> 01:35:19,839
They stamped it, didn't they?
Those damn gideons.

899
01:35:21,341 --> 01:35:24,636
Ethan, if you knew about Jim, why...

900
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:27,722
Why the masquerade? Why take the risk?

901
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:31,601
Well, Claire, you've asked the question.

902
01:35:32,685 --> 01:35:33,895
And you are the answer.

903
01:35:35,146 --> 01:35:36,689
I knew about Jim.

904
01:35:37,273 --> 01:35:38,858
But he didn't know about you.

905
01:35:39,943 --> 01:35:41,194
In all fairness, Ethan...

906
01:35:41,527 --> 01:35:44,364
Claire was never convinced
her charms would work on you.

907
01:35:45,531 --> 01:35:48,743
But I was supremely confident,
having tasted the goods.

908
01:35:51,496 --> 01:35:56,459
"Thou shalt not covet
thy neighbor's wife," Ethan.

909
01:35:58,211 --> 01:36:00,630
Let's just get the money
and get out of here.

910
01:36:00,713 --> 01:36:01,965
Yes, let's get the money.

911
01:36:03,091 --> 01:36:06,135
Ethan, the money.

912
01:36:08,763 --> 01:36:09,889
Give her the money.

913
01:36:13,977 --> 01:36:15,103
You've earned it.

914
01:36:22,944 --> 01:36:24,570
All $10 million.

915
01:36:24,737 --> 01:36:27,865
You know, Claire was wrong
about one thing, Jim.

916
01:36:28,366 --> 01:36:29,367
Oh?

917
01:36:30,118 --> 01:36:31,119
What's that?

918
01:36:50,513 --> 01:36:52,348
Good morning, Mr. Phelps.

919
01:36:54,183 --> 01:36:56,269
I'm not the only one
who's seen you alive.

920
01:37:00,148 --> 01:37:01,899
You son of a bitch.

921
01:37:02,275 --> 01:37:03,359
It's over, Jim.

922
01:37:10,241 --> 01:37:13,036
Don't. Don't, Jim.

923
01:37:13,119 --> 01:37:14,120
"Don't, Jim-ll

924
01:40:25,102 --> 01:40:26,145
damn!

925
01:40:29,357 --> 01:40:31,150
No, it's in the tunnel!

926
01:40:32,109 --> 01:40:34,195
No, no, don't! It'll crash into us!

927
01:40:34,278 --> 01:40:35,905
Accelerate! Accelerate!

928
01:42:38,110 --> 01:42:39,278
Red light!

929
01:42:40,529 --> 01:42:41,781
Green light!

930
01:43:30,329 --> 01:43:34,458
Look, we cannotjust be
sitting around, okay? We need...

931
01:43:34,542 --> 01:43:36,377
I think this is what you're looking for.

932
01:43:43,300 --> 01:43:44,719
Hello, Max.

933
01:43:45,720 --> 01:43:48,681
My lawyers are going
to have a field day with this.

934
01:43:48,764 --> 01:43:51,392
Entrapment, jurisdictional conflict...

935
01:43:51,475 --> 01:43:54,854
Well, maybe we'll
just leave the courts out of this one.

936
01:43:57,565 --> 01:44:02,153
I'm sure we can find
something I have that you need.

937
01:44:02,486 --> 01:44:03,821
<i>In a freak accident,</i>

938
01:44:03,904 --> 01:44:07,324
a <i>helicopter lost altitude,
veered into</i> a <i>tunnel</i>

939
01:44:07,408 --> 01:44:11,579
<i>and collided with a high-speed train
on its way from London to Paris.</i>

940
01:44:11,996 --> 01:44:15,624
<i>The pilot was killed,
but no one on the train was hurt.</i>

941
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:19,670
<i>Authorities have attributed the accident
to instrument failure.</i>

942
01:44:20,045 --> 01:44:22,548
Reach your folks? How are they feeling?

943
01:44:22,631 --> 01:44:23,716
About what?

944
01:44:24,258 --> 01:44:27,928
The apology from
the justice department, vip treatment,

945
01:44:28,012 --> 01:44:29,722
you know, the whole nine yards.

946
01:44:30,973 --> 01:44:33,184
Well, my mom was a little confused

947
01:44:33,267 --> 01:44:35,853
how the DEA could mistake
her and uncle Donald

948
01:44:35,936 --> 01:44:38,147
for a couple of dope smugglers
in the Florida keys.

949
01:44:41,442 --> 01:44:42,526
Cheers.

950
01:44:44,236 --> 01:44:47,656
To you, Luther,
for being off the disavowed list.

951
01:44:47,740 --> 01:44:49,200
Hey, I'm the flavor of the month.

952
01:44:52,703 --> 01:44:54,038
Why don't you come back with me?

953
01:44:57,041 --> 01:44:58,125
L just...

954
01:44:58,834 --> 01:45:00,503
I just don't know why I'd be doing it.

955
01:45:03,506 --> 01:45:04,840
Gotta go catch my flight.

956
01:45:06,717 --> 01:45:08,677
So how's it feel
to be a solid citizen again?

957
01:45:11,305 --> 01:45:12,598
Man, I don't know.

958
01:45:15,059 --> 01:45:16,852
I'm gonna miss being disreputable.

959
01:45:17,728 --> 01:45:19,605
Well, Luther,
if it makes you feel any better...

960
01:45:20,439 --> 01:45:21,816
I'll always think of you that way.

961
01:45:33,661 --> 01:45:35,162
Excuse me. Mr. hunt?

962
01:45:37,081 --> 01:45:38,499
Would you like to watch a movie?

963
01:45:39,542 --> 01:45:41,252
On.

964
01:45:42,628 --> 01:45:43,796
No, thank you.

965
01:45:44,421 --> 01:45:46,841
Would you consider
the cinema of the Caribbean?

966
01:45:49,593 --> 01:45:50,928
Aruba, perhaps?
