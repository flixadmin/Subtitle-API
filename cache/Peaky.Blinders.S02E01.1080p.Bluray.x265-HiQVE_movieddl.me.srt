I promised my friend
Freddie Thorne

00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,640
that I'd say a few words
over his grave

if he should pass before me.

I made this promise before
he became me brother-in-law.

00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,280
I've got some information
you might be interested in.

164
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,240
No charge.

165
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,040
There's an old friend of ours
coming back to the city.

166
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,440
He's, uh, just passing through, he says.

167
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,600
Very grand these days.

168
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,240
He's head of some
secret department,

169
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,240
the Irish Desk.

170
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,760
So I doubt he'll be bothering
with the likes of us, eh?

171
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,400
I'll say good night, Tom.

172
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,400
(METAL BANGING)

173
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,160
MAN: I demand to speak
to a representative!

174
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,640
(YELLING) A representative of
His Majesty the King!

175
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,880
(SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)

176
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,320
Father! Father!

177
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,440
It was the Ulsterman,
the man with the wolf head!

178
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,040
Get the fuck off me!

179
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,960
You must reconcile yourself
with the fate that awaits.

180
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,360
I demand to speak to a representative
of His Majesty the King!

181
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,720
Make your peace with God.

182
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,840
A representative of
His Majesty the King!

183
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,480
-Father.
-Come on.

184
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,520
MAN: Now, wait!
Where are you going?

185
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,560
(LOCKING DOOR)

186
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,400
Does someone here have
business with the King?

187
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,600
Major Campbell.

188
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,960
-(SHOUTING CONTINUES)
-About time.

189
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,560
I am a very busy man, Governor.

190
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,120
In seven and a half minutes,

191
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,880
the man in that cell
is due to be hanged for murder.

192
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,800
The murder of an Irish activist
in Whitechapel.

193
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,560
Does the case ring any bells,
Major Campbell?

194
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,120
No, Governor,

195
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,160
I hear no bells.

196
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,480
Since yesterday morning,

197
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,560
he's been claiming that the murder
was ordered

198
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,720
by the British
Secret Intelligence Service.

199
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,800
(SCOFFS) It's a little late
to be coming up with nonsense like that,

200
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,080
don't you think?

201
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,000
He was told if he kept
his mouth shut

202
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,000
there would be a last-minute pardon,

203
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,360
which has not materialised.

204
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,400
Forgive me, Governor,

205
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,720
but what business is this of mine?

206
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,000
He says the man who hired him

207
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,520
was an Intelligence Service
Chief of Staff,

208
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,880
an Ulsterman.

209
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,920
Carries a cane
with a wolf-head handle,

210
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
a bullet wound in his right leg.

211
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,920
No.

212
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,160
Still no bells. Governor,

213
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,080
you have a very clear remit.

214
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,240
Part of that remit is
to oversee the smooth completion

215
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,640
of executions
sanctioned by the Crown.

216
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,680
And in the next four minutes it is
your duty to escort that man

217
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,960
to the gates of hell.

218
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,000
Is that clear?

219
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,400
And if you should ever have
the desire

220
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,000
to discuss this matter
with anyone else

221
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,040
I know where you live.

222
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,200
(PANICKED BREATHING)

223
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,760
Arthur, Tommy's
called a family meeting.

224
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,440
Arthur!

225
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,840
He just beat the shit out of
an apprentice.

226
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,400
I had to take half the kid away
in buckets.

227
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,840
Arthur.

228
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,080
(HEAVY BREATHING)

2,000.

230
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,480
Come on.

231
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,480
Sit down, Finn.

232
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,200
-Where the bloody hell is Tommy?
-He's on his way.

233
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,240
All right then,
while we're waiting patiently...

234
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,880
Whisky.
(STRAINS)

235
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,720
Left over from the explosion.

236
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,160
It's good stuff, as well.

237
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,920
Right.

238
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,160
Before Tommy gets here,

239
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,160
I think there's a few things
we need to get straight

240
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,640
between the rest of us.

241
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,840
You think?

242
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,200
Yeah.

243
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,320
Yeah, I do. I want to know...

244
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,920
When did we all take a vote
on this expansion south?

245
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,400
You have anything to say,

246
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,280
you wait for Thomas.

247
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,680
Polly's fucking right.

248
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,320
I see all the books.

249
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,240
Legal and off track.

250
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,400
Sort of stuff you don't see.

251
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,880
And in the past year

252
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,480
the Shelby Company Limited

253
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:25,840
has been making £150

254
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,000
a day.

255
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,880
Right? A fucking day!

256
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,400
Sometimes more.

257
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,720
So what I want to know

258
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,240
is why are we changing things?

259
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,040
Polly, look what's happened already.

260
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,040
We haven't even set foot
in London yet

261
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,960
and they've already blown up
our fucking pub.

262
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,400
-Who said anything about cockneys?
-Who else?

263
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,200
Do you know who did it, do you?

264
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,920
-No, she doesn't know who did it.
-(DOOR OPENING)

265
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,640
I'm told only family
are allowed to speak.

266
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,960
Everyone's allowed to speak.

267
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,040
On your feet, Esme,
let's hear what you have to say.

268
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,440
(CLEARING THROAT)

269
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,040
I speak for our household.

270
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,880
-So...
-John, this company is

271
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,280
a modern enterprise and believes in
equal rights for women.

272
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,800
On your feet, Esme.

273
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,160
I'm not a blood member
of this family

274
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,120
but perhaps, indeed,
because I'm not a member

275
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,360
I can see things
in a different light.

276
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,160
So I'll get to my point.

277
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,960
That would be nice.

278
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,320
As my husband said,

279
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,120
Shelby Company Limited
is now very successful.

280
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,080
-(MATCH STRIKES)
-But London...

281
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,000
I have kin in Shepherd's Bush
and Portobello.

282
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,320
It's more like wars
between armies down there.

283
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,760
And the coppers fight
side-by-side with them.

284
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,920
And there are foreigners
of every description

285
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,320
and the use of bombs
is the least of it.

286
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,440
I have a child,

287
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,320
blessed with the Shelby family
good looks.

288
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,800
I want John to see him grow up.

289
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,040
I want us to someday live somewhere
with fresh air and trees

290
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,200
and keep chickens or something.

291
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,360
But London is just smoke
and trouble, Thomas.

292
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,040
Thomas?

293
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,200
That's all I have to say.

294
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:45,520
That was a lot of words,
a lot of words.

295
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,480
Wash them down with a nice drink.

296
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,480
Thank you, Esme.

297
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,120
Firstly, the bang in the pub
had nothing to do with London.

298
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,480
Understood?

299
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,720
The bang is something
I'm dealing with on my own.

300
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,680
Secondly, we've nothing to fear
from the proposed business expansion

301
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,560
so long as we stick together.

302
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,080
And after the first few weeks,

303
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,400
nine tenths of what we do in London
will be legal.

304
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,520
The other tenth is in good hands.
Isn't that right, Arthur?

305
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,960
That's right.

306
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,200
Now, some of you in this room
have expressed your reservations.

Fair enough.

in the future of this company,

If Alfie Solomon
and his Camden boys come to us,

349
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,920
we'll negotiate the use

He was taken six months ago

about 18-years-old.

409
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,440
She's standing
across the street

410
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,160
and she tells me
she's passed over.

411
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,800
Now, my daughter
would have been 18 this year.

412
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,840
On May 15th.

413

And this girl has dark eyes
like mine.

00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:17,480
And she shouts and shouts.

415

And she tells me
she wants to talk to me

because I'm her mother.
