This new state liaison
that's auditing CCPD,

822
00:41:09,482 --> 00:41:11,179
her name's Kristen Kramer,

823
00:41:11,182 --> 00:41:13,176
I just found out that
she's here to catch

824
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:15,554
a dangerous fugitive meta-human.

825
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:18,643
- Hmm.
- She's here for Killer Frost.

826
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:24,188
- That's not who I am anymore.
- I know.

827
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:27,274
I just got to find a
way to make her see that.

828
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:29,860
In the meantime, you need to lay low.

829
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,362
Yeah. That's not gonna happen.

830
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:33,572
She's former Army Intelligence, Frost.

831
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:36,230
I don't care if she's
Xena, Warrior Princess.

832
00:41:36,233 --> 00:41:38,786
I am finally free to live my own life,

833
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:41,288
and no one is gonna
take that away from me.

834
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:45,251
So if this Kristen Kramer
wants to come after me,

835
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:48,462
then I say bring it on.
