1
00:03:02,217 --> 00:03:04,884
I'm kinda lonesome back here.

2
00:03:04,886 --> 00:03:07,654
(Mumbling)
Yeah, little help.

3
00:03:07,656 --> 00:03:12,592
Okay, um, just, I have to
keep my hands on the wheel.

4
00:03:13,795 --> 00:03:16,029
Excuse me. Whoo!

5
00:03:16,031 --> 00:03:17,864
Ah, Dopinder.

6
00:03:17,866 --> 00:03:19,933
Pool. Dead.

7
00:03:21,203 --> 00:03:22,669
Hmm, nice.

8
00:03:23,705 --> 00:03:24,838
Smells good, no?

9
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,873
Not the Daffodil Daydream.
The girl.

10
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,875
Ah, yes. Gita.

11
00:03:28,877 --> 00:03:30,810
Hmm.
She is quite lovely.

12
00:03:30,812 --> 00:03:33,146
She would have made me
a very agreeable wife.

13
00:03:33,148 --> 00:03:35,215
But, um...

14
00:03:35,217 --> 00:03:38,985
Gita's heart has been stolen
by my cousin Bandhu.

15
00:03:38,987 --> 00:03:42,722
He is as dishonorable
as he is attractive.

16
00:03:43,925 --> 00:03:45,892
Dopinder, I'm starting to think

17
00:03:45,894 --> 00:03:47,827
there's a reason I'm in this
cab today.

18
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:49,562
Yeah, Sir, you called for it, remember?

19
00:03:49,564 --> 00:03:54,567
No, my slender brown friend.
Love is a beautiful thing.

20
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:55,969
When you find it, the whole world

21
00:03:55,971 --> 00:03:57,237
tastes like Daffodil Daydream.

22
00:03:58,573 --> 00:04:00,673
So you gotta hold onto love...

23
00:04:00,675 --> 00:04:01,975
Tight!
Ah.

24
00:04:01,977 --> 00:04:03,510
And never let go.

25
00:04:03,512 --> 00:04:04,978
Don't make the same mistakes
I did.

26
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,748
Got it?
Yeah.

27
00:04:07,749 --> 00:04:10,517
Or else the whole world tastes
like Mama June after hot yoga.

28
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:12,852
Sir, what does
Miss Mama June taste like?

29
00:04:12,854 --> 00:04:15,855
Like two hobos fucking in a shoe
filled with piss. Okay, enough.

30
00:04:15,857 --> 00:04:18,791
I can go all day, Dopinder.
The point is, it's bad!

31
00:04:18,793 --> 00:04:20,894
Hmm, it's bad.

32
00:04:20,896 --> 00:04:23,730
Uh, why the fancy red suit,
Mr. Pool?

33
00:04:23,732 --> 00:04:25,832
Oh, that's because
it's Christmas Day, Dopinder.

34
00:04:25,834 --> 00:04:28,268
And I'm after someone
on my naughty list.

35
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,969
I've been waiting one year,
three weeks...

36
00:04:29,971 --> 00:04:31,938
Six days and, oh...

37
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,274
14 minutes to make him fix
what he did to me.

38
00:04:35,911 --> 00:04:38,211
And what did he do to you,
Mr. Pool?

39
00:04:38,213 --> 00:04:39,746
This shit...

40
00:04:40,882 --> 00:04:41,948
Boo!

41
00:05:02,804 --> 00:05:03,970
They won't disappoint.

42
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,306
They'd better not.

43
00:05:06,308 --> 00:05:08,875
And what about next month's shipment?

44
00:05:08,877 --> 00:05:10,610
There won't be one.

45
00:05:10,612 --> 00:05:12,252
You're not the only one
with a war to win.

46
00:05:13,315 --> 00:05:14,881
That won't do.

47
00:05:17,786 --> 00:05:20,286
See, we've had this small disruption

48
00:05:20,288 --> 00:05:21,754
to our supply chain...

49
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,794
We'd appreciate your patience.

50
00:05:30,165 --> 00:05:31,764
Okay.

51
00:05:31,766 --> 00:05:34,233
We'll deliver in full
the following month.

52
00:05:37,739 --> 00:05:39,019
Pleasure doing business with you.

53
00:05:42,744 --> 00:05:44,611
Fucking mutant.

54
00:05:54,356 --> 00:05:56,022
Oh, shit!

55
00:05:56,024 --> 00:05:57,824
I forgot my ammo bag.

56
00:05:57,826 --> 00:05:58,992
Shall we turn back?

57
00:05:58,994 --> 00:06:00,360
No, no time.

58
00:06:00,362 --> 00:06:02,061
Fuck it. I got this.

59
00:06:02,063 --> 00:06:05,365
9, 10, 11, 12 bullets, or bust.

60
00:06:05,367 --> 00:06:06,699
Right here!

61
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:11,070
That's, uh, $27.50.

62
00:06:11,072 --> 00:06:12,872
I... I never carry a wallet
when I'm working.

63
00:06:12,874 --> 00:06:14,741
Ruins the lines of my suit.

64
00:06:14,743 --> 00:06:15,875
Oh.
But, uh,

65
00:06:15,877 --> 00:06:17,210
how about a crisp high five?

66
00:06:17,212 --> 00:06:18,344
Okay.

67
00:06:18,346 --> 00:06:21,014
Merry Christmas.

68
00:06:21,016 --> 00:06:24,150
And a convivial Tuesday
in April to you too, Pool!

69

Oh, hello. I know, right?

79
00:06:48,777 --> 00:06:50,743
Whose balls did I have to fondle

80
00:06:50,745 --> 00:06:52,378
to get my very own movie?

81
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,780
I can't tell you,

82
00:06:53,782 --> 00:06:56,249
but it does rhyme with "Polverine."

83
00:06:56,251 --> 00:06:59,102
And let me tell you,

84
00:06:59,103 --> 00:07:01,954
he's got a nice pair of
smooth criminals down under.

85
00:07:01,956 --> 00:07:06,125
Anyway, I got places to be,
a face to fix and, oh...

86
00:07:06,127 --> 00:07:08,928
Bad guys to kill.

87
00:07:14,202 --> 00:07:15,268
Maximum effort.

88
00:07:25,313 --> 00:07:26,379
Cock shot.

89
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:32,418
Ha!

90
00:07:34,122 --> 00:07:36,255
Rich Corinthian leather.

91
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:40,460
I'm looking for Francis!

92
00:07:40,462 --> 00:07:42,261
Have you seen this man?

93
00:07:42,263 --> 00:07:44,330
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

94
00:07:50,472 --> 00:07:52,171
Ow. Ow!

95
00:07:52,173 --> 00:07:53,272
Yanky, yanky!

96
00:08:26,474 --> 00:08:28,274
I've never said this,
but don't swallow.

97
00:08:49,397 --> 00:08:51,497
Shit.

98
00:08:51,499 --> 00:08:53,566
Did I leave the stove on?

99
00:09:11,085 --> 00:09:12,885
Now, breaking news.

100
00:09:12,887 --> 00:09:14,954
A multi car collision
turned shots fired

101
00:09:14,956 --> 00:09:16,856
on the crosstown expressway
this morning.

102
00:09:16,858 --> 00:09:19,091
Gridlock has kept
police from the scene.

103
00:09:19,093 --> 00:09:21,561
Residents are advised
to remain in their homes.

104
00:09:21,563 --> 00:09:23,229
The assailant appears to be armed,

105
00:09:23,231 --> 00:09:24,831
dangerous, and wearing...

106
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,265
A red suit.
A red suit.

107
00:09:26,935 --> 00:09:28,167
Deadpool.

108
00:09:28,169 --> 00:09:31,838
Negasonic!
Come, we have mission.

109
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,273
Colossus, wait up.

110
00:09:34,275 --> 00:09:37,610
I've given Deadpool
every chance to join us...

111
00:09:37,612 --> 00:09:39,979
But he'd rather act like a child.

112
00:09:39,981 --> 00:09:42,348
A heavily armed child.

113
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:46,252
When will he grow up and see
benefits of becoming X-Man?

114
00:09:46,254 --> 00:09:48,387
Which benefits?
The matching unitards?

115
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:50,289
The house that blows up
every few years?

116
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,390
Please.

117
00:09:51,392 --> 00:09:54,293
House blowing up builds character.

118
00:09:54,295 --> 00:09:56,229
You ate breakfast, yes?

119
00:09:56,231 --> 00:09:59,365
Breakfast is most
important meal of day.

120
00:09:59,367 --> 00:10:03,636
Here, protein bar.
Good for bones.

121
00:10:03,638 --> 00:10:06,305
Deadpool may try to break yours.

122
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:16,115
Get out of the way!

123
00:10:16,117 --> 00:10:17,477
(Indistinct)

124
00:10:33,401 --> 00:10:35,034
Hey! Whoo!

125
00:10:46,114 --> 00:10:47,613
Wait!

126
00:10:47,615 --> 00:10:49,916
You may be wondering,
"Why the red suit?"

127
00:10:49,918 --> 00:10:51,951
Well, that's so bad guys
can't see me bleed.

128
00:10:52,987 --> 00:10:54,420
This guy's got the right idea.

129
00:10:54,422 --> 00:10:55,955
He wore the brown pants.

130
00:10:57,659 --> 00:11:00,026
Fine!
I only have 12 bullets...

131
00:11:00,028 --> 00:11:01,594
So you're gonna have to share!

132
00:11:01,596 --> 00:11:03,496
Let's count them down.

133
00:11:22,717 --> 00:11:24,083
Shit.

134
00:11:27,021 --> 00:11:28,688
Motherfucker!

135
00:11:30,058 --> 00:11:31,190
Ten! Shit!

136
00:11:31,659 --> 00:11:32,725
Nine. Fuck.

137
00:11:33,194 --> 00:11:34,327
Eight.

138
00:11:34,329 --> 00:11:35,394
Shit fuck!

139
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:40,366
Bad Deadpool.

140
00:11:41,669 --> 00:11:44,070
Seven.
Good Deadpool.

141
00:11:56,751 --> 00:11:58,017
Oh!

142
00:12:05,494 --> 00:12:08,934
Someone's not counting. Six.

143
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:28,414
(Spanish)

144
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,016
Oh!

145
00:12:35,323 --> 00:12:37,256
Four...

146
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,159
Gotcha.

147
00:12:41,596 --> 00:12:43,095
Right up main street.

148
00:12:47,068 --> 00:12:48,134
Three, two!

149
00:12:48,136 --> 00:12:50,102
Stupid! Worth it.

150
00:13:14,095 --> 00:13:15,294
Ah!

151
00:13:16,397 --> 00:13:18,431
I'm touching myself tonight.

152
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:20,633
Francis!

153
00:13:20,635 --> 00:13:22,101
Francis...

154
00:13:23,805 --> 00:13:26,238
What the shit biscuit!

155
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,074
Where you at, Francis?

156
00:13:36,784 --> 00:13:38,084
You're not Francis.

157
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:48,461
Really?
Rolling up the sleeves?

158
00:13:58,706 --> 00:14:00,272
You're probably thinking,

159
00:14:00,274 --> 00:14:02,208
"My boyfriend said
this was a superhero movie...

160
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,676
"But that guy in the red suit
just turned

161
00:14:03,678 --> 00:14:06,212
"That other guy
into a fucking kabab!"

162
00:14:06,214 --> 00:14:10,783
Well, I may be super,
but I'm no hero.

163
00:14:10,785 --> 00:14:13,152
And yeah, technically,
this is a murder.

164
00:14:13,154 --> 00:14:15,421
But some of the best love
stories start with a murder.

165
00:14:15,423 --> 00:14:18,491
And that's exactly
what this is, a love story.

166
00:14:18,493 --> 00:14:19,859
And to tell it right...

167
00:14:19,861 --> 00:14:22,261
I gotta take you back
to long before

168
00:14:22,263 --> 00:14:25,698
I squeezed this ass into red spandex.

169
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,434
Look, would it help
if I slow it down for you?

170
00:14:28,436 --> 00:14:30,803
I didn't order the pizza.

171
00:14:30,805 --> 00:14:34,740
Is this 7348 Red Ledge Drive?
Are you Mr. Merchant?

172
00:14:34,742 --> 00:14:38,244
Yeah, the Mr. Merchant who
didn't order the fucking pie!

173
00:14:38,246 --> 00:14:39,411
Then who placed the call?

174
00:14:39,847 --> 00:14:41,380
I did!

175
00:14:43,551 --> 00:14:45,484
Pineapple and olive?

176
00:14:45,486 --> 00:14:48,454
Sweet and salty.

177
00:14:48,456 --> 00:14:49,622
The fuck are you?

178
00:14:49,624 --> 00:14:51,624
The fuck you doing in my crib...

179
00:14:51,626 --> 00:14:52,791
Is it burnt crust?

180
00:14:52,793 --> 00:14:54,727
I... God, I hope not. Um...

181
00:14:54,729 --> 00:14:56,662
Whoa... Man, look,
if this is about that poker game.

182
00:14:56,664 --> 00:14:58,931
I told Howie, I told him that...

183
00:14:58,933 --> 00:15:02,935
Okay, uh, look,
just take whatever you want.

184
00:15:02,937 --> 00:15:05,171
Thanks.
Sir...

185
00:15:05,173 --> 00:15:06,472
Before you do anything to him,

186
00:15:06,474 --> 00:15:08,207
do you mind if I a get a big tip?

187
00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:10,943
Uh, Jeremy, is it?

188
00:15:10,945 --> 00:15:12,578
Umm hmm. Yeah.
Wade. Wade Wilson.

189
00:15:13,648 --> 00:15:16,682
That is a no go
on the tiperoo, Jer.

190
00:15:16,684 --> 00:15:18,551
I'm not here for him.

191
00:15:18,553 --> 00:15:20,286
I'm here for you.

192
00:15:20,288 --> 00:15:21,820
Oh.

193
00:15:21,822 --> 00:15:23,589
Okay, wow, dodged
a big time bullet on that one.

194
00:15:23,591 --> 00:15:26,292
Not out of the woods yet.

195
00:15:26,294 --> 00:15:28,627
You need to seriously ease up
on the bedazzling.

196
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:30,629
They're jeans, not a chandelier.

197
00:15:30,631 --> 00:15:32,865
P.S. I'm keeping your wallet.
You did kinda give it to me.

198
00:15:32,867 --> 00:15:34,767
Okay, just look, Man,
can I have my Sam's card...

199
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:37,836
I will shoot your fucking cat!

200
00:15:37,838 --> 00:15:40,639
I don't really know what that means.
I don't have a cat.

201
00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:42,508
Then whose kitty litter
did I just shit in?

202
00:15:46,547 --> 00:15:48,714
Anyhoo, tell me something...

203
00:15:48,716 --> 00:15:52,551
what situation isn't improved
by pizza?

204
00:15:52,553 --> 00:15:54,853
Do you happen to know
a Meghan Orflosky?

205
00:15:54,855 --> 00:15:56,589
Getting that right?
Orflosky?

206
00:15:56,591 --> 00:15:58,891
Orlovsky? Yeah? Good.

207
00:16:00,228 --> 00:16:01,493
Because she knows you.

208
00:16:01,495 --> 00:16:03,729
Jeremy, I belong to a group
of guys

209
00:16:03,731 --> 00:16:05,864
who take a dime
to beat a fella down.

210
00:16:05,866 --> 00:16:07,433
And little Meghan,
she's not made of money,

211
00:16:07,435 --> 00:16:08,734
but lucky for her...

212
00:16:08,736 --> 00:16:10,769
I got a soft spot.

213
00:16:10,771 --> 00:16:13,272
But I'm a...
A stalker.

214
00:16:13,274 --> 00:16:14,740
Threats hurt, Jer.

215
00:16:14,742 --> 00:16:18,410
Though not nearly as badly
as serrated steel.

216
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:21,513
So keep away from Meghan.

217
00:16:21,515 --> 00:16:22,581
Cool?

218
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:23,749
Yes. Yes, Sir.

219
00:16:23,751 --> 00:16:25,251
Then we're done.

220
00:16:25,253 --> 00:16:27,353
Wait.
We are?

221
00:16:27,355 --> 00:16:29,622
Yeah. We're totally done.

222
00:16:29,624 --> 00:16:31,257
You should've seen your face.

223
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:32,691
I didn't know what to do.
I was so scared.

224
00:16:32,693 --> 00:16:33,826
Soft spot, remember?

225
00:16:35,363 --> 00:16:37,463
You even look in her
general direction again...

226
00:16:37,465 --> 00:16:38,964
And you will learn
in the worst of ways

227
00:16:38,966 --> 00:16:41,300
that I have some hard spots too.

228
00:16:43,037 --> 00:16:44,603
That came out wrong.

229
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,872
Or did it?

230
00:16:48,776 --> 00:16:50,542
(Indistinct)

231
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,020
Mmm... Meghan?

232
00:17:04,292 --> 00:17:06,012
You've heard the last
of Jeremy. He's sorry.

233
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:08,460
No friggin' way.

234
00:17:13,301 --> 00:17:14,433
Should've brought my roller blades.

235
00:17:14,435 --> 00:17:15,868
Show these kids how it's done.

236
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:19,471
Oh. And that's why we do it.
But mostly the money.

237
00:17:19,473 --> 00:17:21,440
Hey, think you could
fuck up my step dad?

238
00:17:21,442 --> 00:17:22,941
I give a guy a pavement facial,

239
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,063
it's because he's earned it.

240
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:25,978
Hey, wait!

241
00:17:27,648 --> 00:17:28,914
You're my hero.

242
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:31,583
No, no, no, no.
That I ain't!

243
00:17:33,087 --> 00:17:35,688
Nope. Never will be.

244
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,690
Oh. Fuck you, Wade.

245
00:17:37,692 --> 00:17:41,360
I'm just a bad guy who gets
paid to fuck up worse guys.

246
00:17:42,596 --> 00:17:44,563
Welcome to Sister Margaret's.

247
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:47,533
It's like a job fair for mercenaries.

248
00:17:47,535 --> 00:17:49,468
Think of us as really
fucked up tooth fairies...

249
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:52,037
Except we knock out the teeth
and take the cash.

250
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:55,107
You'd best hope we never see
your name on a gold card.

251
00:17:55,109 --> 00:17:57,476
Buck! Liefeld...

252
00:17:57,478 --> 00:17:58,744
Hey, Wade!

253
00:17:58,746 --> 00:17:59,978
Wade Wilson,
patron saint of the pitiful.

254
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,847
What can I do for you?

255
00:18:01,849 --> 00:18:03,482
I'd love a Blow Job.

256
00:18:03,484 --> 00:18:04,683
Oh, God, me too.

257
00:18:04,685 --> 00:18:06,819
The drink, moose knuckle.
But first...

258
00:18:08,489 --> 00:18:10,522
Hey, and I ain't taking
any babysitting money, all right?

259
00:18:10,524 --> 00:18:12,091
Make sure that gets back to Ms...

260
00:18:12,093 --> 00:18:13,392
Orlovsky.

261
00:18:13,394 --> 00:18:14,460
Yeah, her.

262
00:18:14,462 --> 00:18:15,894
You sure?
Hmm.

263
00:18:15,896 --> 00:18:18,464
You know, for a merc,
you're pretty warm blooded.

264
00:18:18,466 --> 00:18:20,432
I bet you let the kid off
easy, too.

265
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:22,401
Oh, he's not a bad kid, Weas.

266
00:18:22,403 --> 00:18:23,635
Just a little light stalking.

267
00:18:23,637 --> 00:18:25,371
I was way worse than him
when I was his age.

268
00:18:25,373 --> 00:18:27,005
I was traveling to exotic places...

269
00:18:27,007 --> 00:18:29,775
Baghdad, Mogadishu, Jacksonville,

270
00:18:29,777 --> 00:18:31,677
meeting new and exciting
people. And then, uh...

271
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,879
Killing them.
Yeah, I've seen your Instagram.

272
00:18:33,881 --> 00:18:36,415
So what was Special Forces
doing in Jacksonville, anyway?

273
00:18:36,417 --> 00:18:37,916
That's classified.

274
00:18:37,918 --> 00:18:40,152
They have a wonderful TGI Fridays.

275
00:18:40,154 --> 00:18:42,654
All right, Kahlua, Baileys and...

276
00:18:42,656 --> 00:18:43,922
Whipped cream.

277
00:18:43,924 --> 00:18:46,558
I give you a Blow Job.

278
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,926
Why do you make me make that?

279
00:18:47,928 --> 00:18:49,795
Kelly, Kelly, Kelly...

280
00:18:49,797 --> 00:18:51,397
Take that over to Buck please,

281
00:18:51,399 --> 00:18:53,165
and tell him it's from Boothe.
Little foreplay.

282
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:55,634
Remind me what good
will come of this?

283
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:57,703
I don't take the shits.
I just disturb them.

284
00:18:57,705 --> 00:18:59,004
Boothe!
Oh!

285
00:18:59,006 --> 00:19:00,406
Easy, Man.
Hold up! Hold up!

286
00:19:00,408 --> 00:19:01,473
What you want?

287
00:19:04,078 --> 00:19:06,879
Cheers. To your health.
Fuck you.

288
00:19:06,881 --> 00:19:09,047
Come here, you fat fuck!

289
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:10,749
That's a new stool.

290
00:19:15,523 --> 00:19:16,955
Stay the fuck down.

291
00:19:19,627 --> 00:19:21,427
Whoa! Took his ass out!

292
00:19:21,429 --> 00:19:23,095
All right, move.
Move, move, move.

293
00:19:23,097 --> 00:19:24,463
Buck, go rest.

294
00:19:25,699 --> 00:19:27,059
Boothe got hit then went down.

295
00:19:30,738 --> 00:19:33,472
Yeah, he's still breathing.

296
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:37,643
Nobody wins today.

297
00:19:37,645 --> 00:19:39,445
Nice try, Wade.

298
00:19:39,447 --> 00:19:41,580
You got me.
I picked Boothe in the dead pool.

299
00:19:41,582 --> 00:19:42,948
Who did you pick?

300
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:45,150
Yeah, Wade, about that, um...

301
00:19:45,152 --> 00:19:46,685
No.

302
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:48,620
You did not bet on me to die.

303
00:19:51,992 --> 00:19:53,592
You bet on me to die. Wow!

304
00:19:53,594 --> 00:19:55,461
Motherfucker, you're
the world's worst friend.

305
00:19:55,463 --> 00:19:57,696
Well, joke's on you.
I'm living to 102.

306
00:19:57,698 --> 00:19:59,832
And then dying.
Like the city of Detroit.

307
00:19:59,834 --> 00:20:02,835
I'm sorry. I just...
I wanted to win money.

308
00:20:02,837 --> 00:20:04,136
I never win anything.

309
00:20:04,138 --> 00:20:05,237
Whatever.

310
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:06,972
Soldiers of fortune,
drinks on me!

311
00:20:09,477 --> 00:20:11,243
Domestic, nothing imported.

312
00:20:14,014 --> 00:20:15,647
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

313
00:20:15,649 --> 00:20:19,218
Baby, are you sure you wanna
shoot your whole wad?

314
00:20:19,753 --> 00:20:22,621
Uh... Tight.

315
00:20:24,091 --> 00:20:26,525
Vanessa.
Wade.

316
00:20:26,527 --> 00:20:28,727
What's a nice place like you
doing in a girl like this?

317
00:20:29,964 --> 00:20:31,230
I'd hit that.

318
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,500
Buck, you best apologize before...

319
00:20:34,502 --> 00:20:36,902
Yeah, that.

320
00:20:36,904 --> 00:20:38,670
Say the magic words, Fat Gandalf.

321
00:20:38,672 --> 00:20:40,506
I'm sorry.
Breathe through the nose.

322
00:20:40,508 --> 00:20:42,774
I don't have a filter
between my brain and my...

323
00:20:42,776 --> 00:20:44,776
Let go. Okay.
Hey, oh, oh, oh...

324
00:20:44,778 --> 00:20:45,878
Hakuna his tatas.
He's sorry.

325
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,212
I'm working on it.

326
00:20:47,214 --> 00:20:49,848
Get out of here.
Go. Go cast a spell.

327
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:52,251
Hey. Hands off the merchandise.

328
00:20:53,821 --> 00:20:55,254
Merchandise? Huh...

329
00:20:55,256 --> 00:20:57,856
So you, uh...

330
00:20:57,858 --> 00:20:59,224
Bump fuzzies for money?

331
00:20:59,226 --> 00:21:01,293
Yep.
Rough childhood?

332
00:21:01,295 --> 00:21:02,561
Rougher than yours.

333
00:21:02,563 --> 00:21:04,730
Daddy left before I was born.

334
00:21:04,732 --> 00:21:06,231
Daddy left before I was conceived.

335
00:21:07,535 --> 00:21:09,101
Ever had a cigarette
put out on your skin?

336
00:21:09,103 --> 00:21:10,602
Where else do you put one out?

337
00:21:10,604 --> 00:21:11,870
I was molested.

338
00:21:11,872 --> 00:21:13,672
Me too. Uncle.

339
00:21:13,674 --> 00:21:16,141
Uncles. They took turns.

340
00:21:16,143 --> 00:21:17,676
I watched my own birthday party

341
00:21:17,678 --> 00:21:18,877
through the keyhole
of a locked closet...

342
00:21:18,879 --> 00:21:20,279
Which also happens to be my...

343
00:21:20,281 --> 00:21:23,148
Your bedroom. Lucky.
I slept in a dishwasher box.

344
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:25,751
You had a dishwasher.

345
00:21:25,753 --> 00:21:26,852
I didn't even know sleep.

346
00:21:26,854 --> 00:21:28,787
It was pretty much
24/7 ball gags,

347
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:30,255
brownie mix and clown porn.

348
00:21:34,161 --> 00:21:35,627
Who would do such a thing?

349
00:21:37,097 --> 00:21:40,732
Hopefully you, later tonight?

350
00:21:43,337 --> 00:21:48,340
Hey, what can I get for,
uh, $275 and a...

351
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:51,243
A Yogurtland rewards card?

352
00:21:51,245 --> 00:21:54,012
Baby, about 48 minutes of
whatever the fuck you want.

353
00:21:55,316 --> 00:21:57,182
And a low fat dessert.

354
00:22:04,124 --> 00:22:06,625
Did she just put a gift card
in your mouth?

355
00:22:07,795 --> 00:22:09,928
It's time to put balls in holes.

356
00:22:10,898 --> 00:22:12,598
You said whatever I want.

357
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,600
I get it.

358
00:22:14,602 --> 00:22:16,101
You love skee ball.

359
00:22:16,103 --> 00:22:18,370
Apparently more than
you love vagina.

360
00:22:18,372 --> 00:22:20,839
That's a tough call.

361
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:23,108
I just wanna get to
know the real you, you know.

362
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:25,110
Not the short shorted, two dimensional

363
00:22:25,112 --> 00:22:27,079
sex object peddled by Hollywood.

364
00:22:27,081 --> 00:22:28,146
Balls in holes.

365
00:22:29,216 --> 00:22:30,282
Balls in holes.

366
00:22:30,284 --> 00:22:31,917
Prepare to lose tragically.

367
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,051
Bring it, Big Man.

368
00:22:33,053 --> 00:22:34,119
Okay.

369
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:37,756
Uh oh.

370
00:22:38,158 --> 00:22:39,224
Uh oh.

371
00:22:40,327 --> 00:22:41,927
The limited edition

372
00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:45,197
Voltron: Defender of
the Universe ring, por favor.

373
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:48,767
Okay. Here we go.

374
00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:50,902
Had my eye on this sucker for
a while.

375
00:22:50,904 --> 00:22:52,838
And I will take the pencil eraser.

376
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,239
Okay.

377
00:22:54,241 --> 00:22:57,142
You are now the protector
of the planet Arus.

378
00:22:57,144 --> 00:22:59,144
And you can erase stuff...

379
00:22:59,146 --> 00:23:00,912
Written in pencil.

380
00:23:00,914 --> 00:23:02,280
M'lady?

381
00:23:02,282 --> 00:23:03,749
Well, I hate to break it to you...

382
00:23:03,751 --> 00:23:06,018
But your 48 minutes are up.

383
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,920
Hey, how many more minutes
can I get for this?

384
00:23:08,922 --> 00:23:11,356
FYI, five mini lion bots
come together

385
00:23:11,358 --> 00:23:13,792
to form one super bot, so...

386
00:23:13,794 --> 00:23:16,895
Five mini lion bots?
Three minutes.

387
00:23:16,897 --> 00:23:18,564
Deal.

388
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:20,805
What do we do with the remaining
two minutes, 37 seconds?

389
00:23:21,035 --> 00:23:22,100
Cuddle?

390
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,106
How long can you keep this up?

391
00:23:28,108 --> 00:23:29,441
All year?

392
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,853
Happy Valentine's Day.

393
00:23:49,329 --> 00:23:51,063
Happy Chinese New Year.

394
00:23:51,065 --> 00:23:52,397
Year of the Dog.

395
00:23:57,471 --> 00:23:59,271
Relax.

396
00:23:59,273 --> 00:24:01,440
And Happy International
Women's Day.

397
00:24:05,979 --> 00:24:09,147
No. No. No.

398
00:24:11,385 --> 00:24:12,751
Happy Lent.

399
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:17,889
Ow, ow.

400
00:24:17,891 --> 00:24:19,157
Wade?
Sorry.

401
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:20,759
Happy Halloween.

402
00:24:20,761 --> 00:24:21,893
Happy Halloween.

403
00:24:31,438 --> 00:24:33,305
Happy Thanksgiving.

404
00:24:35,242 --> 00:24:36,242
I love you.

405
00:24:40,247 --> 00:24:42,314
If your left leg is Thanksgiving...

406
00:24:42,316 --> 00:24:44,116
and your right leg is Christmas...

407
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:46,985
can I visit you between the holidays?

408
00:24:47,788 --> 00:24:48,887
Oh!

409
00:24:48,889 --> 00:24:50,789
That sweater is terrible.

410
00:24:51,892 --> 00:24:53,325
But red looks good on you.

411
00:24:53,327 --> 00:24:54,760
Red's your color.

412
00:24:54,762 --> 00:24:56,294
Brings out the bloodshot
in your eyes.

413
00:24:57,197 --> 00:24:58,296
Listen, I've been thinking...

414
00:24:58,298 --> 00:25:00,132
Really?

415
00:25:00,134 --> 00:25:02,200
About why we're so good together.

416
00:25:02,202 --> 00:25:04,136
Why's that?

417
00:25:04,138 --> 00:25:08,140
Well, your crazy matches
my crazy. Big time.

418
00:25:08,142 --> 00:25:10,075
Hmm.

419
00:25:10,077 --> 00:25:11,810
And, uh, we're like two
jigsaw pieces,

420
00:25:11,812 --> 00:25:13,411
you know, the weird curvy edges...

421
00:25:13,413 --> 00:25:15,881
You put them together and you
can see the picture on top.

422
00:25:16,483 --> 00:25:17,816
Right.

423
00:25:18,218 --> 00:25:20,051
Wade...

424
00:25:20,053 --> 00:25:22,487
There's something I've been
meaning to ask you.

425
00:25:22,489 --> 00:25:25,157
But only because you haven't
gotten around to asking me.

426
00:25:27,227 --> 00:25:28,360
Will you, uh...

427
00:25:29,463 --> 00:25:31,429
Stick it in my...
Marry me?

428
00:25:33,167 --> 00:25:35,433
Uh... Jinx?

429
00:25:35,435 --> 00:25:37,302
Huh.

430
00:25:37,304 --> 00:25:38,470
Where were you hiding that?

431
00:25:38,472 --> 00:25:40,505
Nowhere.

432
00:25:40,507 --> 00:25:42,307
They say one month's salary.
So, uh...

433
00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:43,341
You mean?

434
00:25:43,343 --> 00:25:44,409
I do.

435
00:25:44,411 --> 00:25:45,477
That's my line.

436
00:25:48,916 --> 00:25:51,316
I love you, Wade Wilson.

437
00:25:51,318 --> 00:25:52,818
You're supposed to...
So that's a...

438
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,252
Yes!
Whoo!

439
00:25:54,988 --> 00:25:56,121
Yes!

440
00:25:58,192 --> 00:26:00,058
I feel just like a little girl.

441
00:26:04,998 --> 00:26:07,332
What if I just held on
and never let go?

442
00:26:07,334 --> 00:26:10,068
Just ride a bitch's back,
like Yoda on Luke.

443
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:12,404
Oh, Star Wars jokes.

444
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,172
Empire.

445
00:26:15,475 --> 00:26:16,942
Jesus Christ.

446
00:26:16,944 --> 00:26:18,944
It's like I made you in a computer.

447
00:26:20,514 --> 00:26:21,580
Mmm.

448
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:24,149
Hey.

449
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,551
Perfect.

450
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:31,957
Let's see.
All right, wee break.

451
00:26:31,959 --> 00:26:33,225
Shake it, yeah.

452
00:26:39,366 --> 00:26:40,999
Here's the thing.

453
00:26:41,001 --> 00:26:42,968
Life is an endless series
of train wrecks...

454
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:47,372
With only brief, commercial
like breaks of happiness.

455
00:26:47,374 --> 00:26:50,175
This had been the ultimate
commercial break.

456
00:26:52,512 --> 00:26:54,012
Which meant it was time to return

457
00:26:54,014 --> 00:26:55,914
to our regularly scheduled program.

458
00:26:55,916 --> 00:26:57,649
What the...

459
00:26:57,651 --> 00:26:58,984
Oh, my God. Wade?

460
00:27:05,158 --> 00:27:06,992
You're clowning.

461
00:27:06,994 --> 00:27:08,593
You're not clowning?

462
00:27:08,595 --> 00:27:11,046
I sense clowns.

463
00:27:11,047 --> 00:27:13,498
People react to news of late
stage cancer differently.

464
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,401
There are certainly options
we can look into.

465
00:27:16,403 --> 00:27:18,270
New drugs are being
developed every day.

466
00:27:22,676 --> 00:27:24,342
So what do we do?

467
00:27:24,344 --> 00:27:27,946
Surely there is something we
can do.

468
00:27:27,948 --> 00:27:30,482
My uncle Ivan was diagnosed
with thyroid cancer...

469
00:27:30,484 --> 00:27:33,084
And there were all these new
experimental drugs from Germany.

470
00:27:33,086 --> 00:27:35,587
Vanessa's already
working on Plan A, B,

471
00:27:35,589 --> 00:27:37,589
all the way through Z.

472
00:27:37,591 --> 00:27:41,960
Me? I'm memorizing
the details of her face.

473
00:27:41,962 --> 00:27:44,329
Like it's the first time
I'm seeing it.

474
00:27:44,331 --> 00:27:45,463
Or the last.

475
00:27:45,465 --> 00:27:47,132
Mr. Wilson...

476
00:27:47,134 --> 00:27:48,967
Mr. Wilson?

477
00:27:48,969 --> 00:27:52,237
Take your time to process this.

478
00:27:52,239 --> 00:27:54,239
It's important not to
do anything rash.

479
00:28:05,619 --> 00:28:08,386
Now, if I were a 200 pound sack

480
00:28:08,388 --> 00:28:11,056
of assholes named Francis,
where would I hide?

481
00:28:14,728 --> 00:28:15,994
Oh.

482
00:28:36,416 --> 00:28:38,350
A hush falls over the crowd

483
00:28:38,352 --> 00:28:40,652
as rookie sensation Wade W. Wilson...

484
00:28:40,654 --> 00:28:44,289
Out of Regina, Saskatchewan,
lines up the shot.

485
00:28:46,093 --> 00:28:47,692
His form looks good.

486
00:28:48,528 --> 00:28:49,694
Oh!

487
00:28:49,696 --> 00:28:54,232
And that's why Regina
rhymes with fun.

488
00:28:54,234 --> 00:28:56,534
Ladies and Gentlemen,
what you're witnessing...

489
00:28:56,536 --> 00:28:59,004
Is sweet dick kicking revenge.

490
00:28:59,773 --> 00:29:01,673
Oh! Giving him the business.

491
00:29:01,675 --> 00:29:04,009
Incoming!

492
00:29:04,011 --> 00:29:07,679
This is taking unsportsmanlike
conduct to a whole new level!

493
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,120
Looking good, Francis.
Well rested.

494
00:29:15,122 --> 00:29:17,288
Like you've been pitching,
not catching.

495
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:19,324
Ringing any bells? No?

496
00:29:24,264 --> 00:29:25,497
How about now?

497
00:29:29,436 --> 00:29:31,636
Wade fucking Wilson.

498
00:29:34,174 --> 00:29:36,324
Well, hello, Gorgeous.

499
00:29:36,325 --> 00:29:38,475
Yeah, like I got bit
by a radioactive Shar-Pei.

500
00:29:38,478 --> 00:29:41,679
Yeah. And whose fault
is that, huh, Francis?

501
00:29:41,681 --> 00:29:43,715
Yeah, time to undo what
you did to this butterface.

502
00:29:43,717 --> 00:29:45,550
Please, you should thank me.

503
00:29:45,552 --> 00:29:47,185
Apparently, I made you immortal.

504
00:29:47,187 --> 00:29:48,720
I'm actually quite jealous.

505
00:29:48,722 --> 00:29:51,222
Yeah, but this ain't
a life worth living, is it?

506
00:29:53,193 --> 00:29:54,826
Now, I'm about to do to you

507
00:29:54,828 --> 00:29:57,362
what Limp Bizkit did to
music in the late 90s.

508
00:29:59,433 --> 00:30:00,498
Dad?

509
00:30:03,837 --> 00:30:06,604
I think we can all agree
that shit just went sideways

510
00:30:06,606 --> 00:30:08,540
in the most colossal way.

511
00:30:09,509 --> 00:30:12,077
Well, maybe not the most.

512
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:15,780
Uh... This is
my most prized possession.

513
00:30:16,349 --> 00:30:17,449
Wham?

514
00:30:17,451 --> 00:30:19,717
No, no, no. Wham!

515
00:30:19,719 --> 00:30:23,321
Make It Big is the album that George
and Andy earned the exclamation point.

516
00:30:24,324 --> 00:30:25,857
So, am I supposed to just smile

517
00:30:25,859 --> 00:30:27,325
and wave you out the door?

518
00:30:27,327 --> 00:30:28,726
Think of it like spring cleaning.

519
00:30:28,728 --> 00:30:30,261
Only if spring was death.

520
00:30:30,263 --> 00:30:32,630
God, if I had a nickel
for every time

521
00:30:32,632 --> 00:30:35,233
I spanked it to Bernadette Peters.

522
00:30:35,235 --> 00:30:37,469
Sounds like you do.

523
00:30:37,471 --> 00:30:39,404
Bernadette is not going anywhere,

524
00:30:39,406 --> 00:30:41,406
because you're not going anywhere.

525
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,707
Drink.

526
00:30:42,709 --> 00:30:44,109
You're right.
Cancer is only in my liver,

527
00:30:44,111 --> 00:30:45,410
lungs, prostate, and brain.

528
00:30:45,412 --> 00:30:46,644
All things I can live without.

529
00:30:47,747 --> 00:30:48,847
Ha.

530
00:30:48,849 --> 00:30:50,882
You belong here at home.

531
00:30:50,884 --> 00:30:52,517
Surrounded by your Voltron

532
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:54,652
and your Bernadette,
and you and me.

533
00:30:55,856 --> 00:30:59,491
Listen, we both know
that cancer is a shit show.

534
00:31:00,161 --> 00:31:03,294
Like, a Yakov Smirnoff opening
for the

535
00:31:03,296 --> 00:31:07,164
Spin Doctors at the Iowa
State Fair shit show.

536
00:31:07,168 --> 00:31:12,704
And under no circumstances
will I take you to that show.

537
00:31:13,907 --> 00:31:15,707
I want you to remember me.

538
00:31:17,244 --> 00:31:19,144
Not the ghost of Christmas me.

539
00:31:19,146 --> 00:31:21,379
Well, I wanna remember us.

540
00:31:21,381 --> 00:31:23,815
I swear to God, I will
find you in the next life...

541
00:31:23,816 --> 00:31:26,250
and I'm gonna boom box Careless
Whisper outside your window.

542
00:31:26,253 --> 00:31:27,652
Wham!

543
00:31:30,924 --> 00:31:34,192
No one is boom boxing shit.
Okay?

544
00:31:36,596 --> 00:31:38,196
We can fight this.

545
00:31:41,268 --> 00:31:44,269
Besides, I just realized something.

546
00:31:44,271 --> 00:31:46,604
You win.
Your life is officially

547
00:31:46,606 --> 00:31:49,407
way more fucked up than mine.

548
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,746
I love you.

549
00:32:06,426 --> 00:32:07,625
Wade.

550
00:32:09,696 --> 00:32:11,262
Weas.

551
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:13,565
You look like you need
a Blow Job and a shower.

552
00:32:13,567 --> 00:32:15,700
Though courtesy calls
for the latter first.

553
00:32:15,702 --> 00:32:17,468
How about three shots of Patron?

554
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:21,306
Or how about Triticum
Aestivum, Wheatgrass.

555
00:32:21,308 --> 00:32:22,640
Excellent for the immune system.

556
00:32:22,642 --> 00:32:24,742
Jesus Christ.
You sound like Vanessa.

557
00:32:24,744 --> 00:32:27,128
Here, check it out.

558
00:32:27,129 --> 00:32:29,513
She's sending away for all
these colorful clinic brochures.

559
00:32:29,516 --> 00:32:31,716
I'm sure they're all FDA approved.

560
00:32:31,718 --> 00:32:34,719
Chechnya. Isn't that where
you go to get cancer?

561
00:32:34,721 --> 00:32:37,855
You got China and Central Mexico.

562
00:32:37,857 --> 00:32:40,325
You know how they
say "Cancer" in Spanish?

563
00:32:40,327 --> 00:32:41,859
No.

564
00:32:41,861 --> 00:32:43,595
El Cancer.
Oh.

565
00:32:43,597 --> 00:32:45,863
I could have guessed that.

566
00:32:45,865 --> 00:32:47,432
Look how happy you look here.

567
00:32:47,434 --> 00:32:49,000
Mind if I keep this?
Put it up,

568
00:32:49,002 --> 00:32:51,903
so I can remember
when you looked alive.

569
00:32:51,905 --> 00:32:53,905
At least now I'm gonna
win the dead pool.

570
00:32:53,907 --> 00:32:56,708
Now that you're gonna die
tragically of cancer.

571
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:58,610
I got it, Weas. Thanks.

572
00:32:58,612 --> 00:33:01,012
Oh.

573
00:33:01,014 --> 00:33:03,715
And, uh, that guy over there
came in looking for you.

574
00:33:03,717 --> 00:33:06,651
Real Grim Reaper type.

575
00:33:06,653 --> 00:33:08,686
I don't know.
Might further the plot.

576
00:33:12,692 --> 00:33:13,791
Boothe.

577
00:33:13,793 --> 00:33:14,959
Wade.

578
00:33:20,267 --> 00:33:21,699
Mr. Wilson.

579
00:33:21,701 --> 00:33:22,900
How can I help you?

580
00:33:22,902 --> 00:33:25,670
Besides luring children
into a panel van.

581
00:33:25,672 --> 00:33:29,440
I understand you've recently been
diagnosed with terminal cancer.

582
00:33:29,442 --> 00:33:30,608
Stalker alert.

583
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:33,511
It's my job.
Recruitment.

584
00:33:33,513 --> 00:33:36,948
I'm sorry you've had
such a tough go.

585
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:39,417
But you're a fighter.
Special Forces.

586
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:42,320
41 confirmed kills.

587
00:33:42,322 --> 00:33:43,688
One every seven weeks.

588
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:46,724
Same rate most folks
get a haircut. Hmm...

589
00:33:46,726 --> 00:33:47,992
It's to wash the taste out.

590
00:33:47,994 --> 00:33:51,562
It's tough to forget being so impressive.

591
00:33:51,564 --> 00:33:53,598
And now you spend your days

592
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,600
sticking up for the little people...

593
00:33:55,602 --> 00:33:57,602
People change.
What do you want?

594
00:33:57,604 --> 00:34:00,738
I represent an organization
that may be able to help.

595
00:34:02,609 --> 00:34:06,844
What if I told you
we can cure your cancer?

596
00:34:06,846 --> 00:34:11,015
And what's more, give you abilities
most men only dream of?

597
00:34:14,688 --> 00:34:16,587
I'd say that you sound
like an infomercial,

598
00:34:16,589 --> 00:34:18,756
but not a good one, like Slap Chop.

599
00:34:18,758 --> 00:34:20,491
More Shake Weight-y.

600
00:34:20,493 --> 00:34:23,561
The world needs extraordinary soldiers.

601
00:34:23,563 --> 00:34:25,697
We won't just make you better.

602
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:28,766
We will make you better than better.

603
00:34:29,703 --> 00:34:31,369
A superhero.

604
00:34:31,371 --> 00:34:34,105
Look, Agent Smith,

605
00:34:34,107 --> 00:34:36,741
I tried the hero business
and it left a mark.

606
00:34:36,743 --> 00:34:39,510
But if I ever hit "Fuck it,"
I'll look you up.

607
00:34:40,013 --> 00:34:41,779
Oh, um...

608
00:34:41,781 --> 00:34:43,481
Shit. We're within
500 yards of a school,

609
00:34:43,483 --> 00:34:44,716
so you may wanna, you know...

610
00:34:49,656 --> 00:34:50,922
His drink's on him.

611
00:34:56,596 --> 00:34:58,429
What did he say?

612
00:35:20,887 --> 00:35:22,620
Hey, what's going on?

613
00:35:22,622 --> 00:35:25,022
Hey. Sorry.

614
00:35:26,526 --> 00:35:29,427
I had a Liam Neeson nightmare.

615
00:35:29,429 --> 00:35:30,895
I dreamt I kidnapped his daughter

616
00:35:30,897 --> 00:35:32,630
and he just wasn't having it.

617
00:35:40,173 --> 00:35:45,510
Hey, uh, they've made
three of those movies.

618
00:35:45,512 --> 00:35:48,713
At some point you have to wonder
if he's just a bad parent.

619
00:35:48,715 --> 00:35:49,781
Hmm.

620
00:36:02,962 --> 00:36:06,964
The worst part about cancer
isn't what it does to you...

621
00:36:06,966 --> 00:36:10,101
But what it does to
the people you love.

622
00:36:10,103 --> 00:36:12,804
Who knew if this guy
could save my life...

623
00:36:12,806 --> 00:36:15,940
But I knew there was only one
way that I could save hers.

624
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:21,946
Isn't that what superheroes do?

625
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:38,496
Okay. Let's pro-con
this superhero thing.

626
00:36:38,965 --> 00:36:40,164
Ow.

627
00:36:40,166 --> 00:36:43,134
They pull down a gaggle of ass.

628
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,702
Local dry cleaning discounts.

629
00:36:44,704 --> 00:36:46,571
Lucrative film deals,
both origin stories

630
00:36:46,573 --> 00:36:48,739
and larger ensemble team movies.

631
00:36:48,741 --> 00:36:51,843
Con: They're all lame ass
teacher's pets.

632
00:36:51,845 --> 00:36:53,711
You know, I can hear you.

633
00:36:53,713 --> 00:36:56,681
I wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to them.

634
00:36:56,683 --> 00:36:58,983
Stay right here.

635
00:36:58,985 --> 00:37:01,252
You've been warned before, Deadpool.

636
00:37:01,254 --> 00:37:04,989
This is a shameful and
reckless use of your powers.

637
00:37:04,991 --> 00:37:07,124
You will both be coming with us.

638
00:37:07,126 --> 00:37:09,060
Look, Colossus,
I don't have time for

639
00:37:09,062 --> 00:37:11,162
the goody two shoes
bullshit right now!

640
00:37:11,164 --> 00:37:13,097
And you are?

641
00:37:14,734 --> 00:37:16,634
Negasonic Teenage Warhead.

642
00:37:16,636 --> 00:37:20,037
Negasonic Teenage...
What the shit?

643
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:21,939
That's the coolest name ever!

644
00:37:23,276 --> 00:37:26,010
So, what, you're like,
uh, his sidekick?

645
00:37:26,012 --> 00:37:27,645
No. Trainee.

646
00:37:27,647 --> 00:37:29,046
Let me guess.

647
00:37:29,048 --> 00:37:31,682
X-Men left you behind on what?
Shit detail?

648
00:37:31,684 --> 00:37:33,434
What does that make you?

649
00:37:33,435 --> 00:37:35,185
Pretending you're not here,
Negasonic Teenage Warhead.

650
00:37:35,188 --> 00:37:36,654
Can we trade names?

651
00:37:36,656 --> 00:37:38,155
Can we go?

652
00:37:38,157 --> 00:37:40,691
Look!
I'm a teenage girl.

653
00:37:40,693 --> 00:37:42,894
I'd rather be anywhere than here.

654
00:37:42,896 --> 00:37:45,096
I'm all about long sullen silences...

655
00:37:45,098 --> 00:37:49,033
Followed by mean comments,
followed by more silences.

656
00:37:49,035 --> 00:37:52,270
So what's it gonna be, huh?
Long sullen silence...

657
00:37:52,272 --> 00:37:54,972
Or mean comment? Go on.

658
00:37:56,175 --> 00:37:57,542
You got me in a box here.

659
00:37:57,544 --> 00:37:58,643
Aha!

660
00:37:58,645 --> 00:38:00,645
We can't allow this, Deadpool.

661
00:38:00,647 --> 00:38:02,046
Please, come quietly.

662
00:38:02,048 --> 00:38:04,315
You big chrome cock gobbler!

663
00:38:04,317 --> 00:38:05,767
That's not nice.

664
00:38:05,768 --> 00:38:07,218
You're really gonna
fuck this up for me?

665
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:11,789
Trust me, that wheezing bag
of dick tips has it coming.

666
00:38:11,791 --> 00:38:14,725
He's pure evil.

667
00:38:14,727 --> 00:38:18,029
Besides...
Nobody's getting hurt.

668
00:38:23,202 --> 00:38:25,603
That guy was already up there
when I got here.

669
00:38:25,605 --> 00:38:28,839
Wade, you are better than this.

670
00:38:28,841 --> 00:38:31,208
Join us.
Use your powers for good.

671
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:32,276
Heads up.

672
00:38:32,278 --> 00:38:33,744
Be a superhero.

673
00:38:33,746 --> 00:38:35,513
Listen!

674
00:38:35,514 --> 00:38:37,281
The day I decide to become a
crime fighting shit swizzler...

675
00:38:37,283 --> 00:38:40,685
Who rooms with a bunch of other little
whiners at the Neverland mansion...

676
00:38:40,687 --> 00:38:45,623
Of some creepy, old, bald,
Heaven's Gate looking motherfucker...

677
00:38:45,625 --> 00:38:47,291
On that day...

678
00:38:47,293 --> 00:38:49,694
I'll send your shiny,
happy ass a friend request.

679
00:38:49,696 --> 00:38:52,163
But until then, I'mma do
what I came here to do.

680
00:38:52,165 --> 00:38:54,966
Either that or slap
the bitch outta you!

681
00:38:54,968 --> 00:38:56,233
Wade...
Hey.

682
00:38:56,235 --> 00:38:57,602
Zip it, Sinead!

683
00:38:57,604 --> 00:38:58,669
Hey, douche pool!

684
00:38:58,671 --> 00:38:59,971
And I hope you're watching...

685
00:39:04,711 --> 00:39:06,377
Quite unfortunate.

686
00:39:09,849 --> 00:39:12,183
That does it!

687
00:39:13,386 --> 00:39:14,852
Oh!

688
00:39:14,854 --> 00:39:17,922
Canada!

689
00:39:19,058 --> 00:39:20,124
That's not good.

690
00:39:20,126 --> 00:39:21,292
Wade, please.

691
00:39:21,294 --> 00:39:24,195
Cock shot!

692
00:39:24,197 --> 00:39:26,030
Oh, your poor wife.

693
00:39:26,032 --> 00:39:28,265
You really should stop.

694
00:39:31,337 --> 00:39:33,938
All the dinosaurs feared the T-rex.

695
00:39:38,845 --> 00:39:40,778
I promise this gets
worse for you, Big Boy!

696
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,747
This is embarrassing.

697
00:39:42,749 --> 00:39:45,416
Please, stay down.

698
00:39:45,418 --> 00:39:48,019
You ever hear of the one legged
man in the ass kicking contest?

699
00:39:48,021 --> 00:39:49,420
Do you have off switch?

700
00:39:49,422 --> 00:39:51,188
Yeah, it's right next to the prostate.

701
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,323
Or is that the on switch?

702
00:39:52,325 --> 00:39:54,425
Enough!

703
00:40:03,036 --> 00:40:05,302
Let us go talk to the Professor.

704
00:40:05,304 --> 00:40:07,171
McAvoy or Stewart?

705
00:40:07,173 --> 00:40:09,407
These timelines are so confusing.

706
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:13,377
"Dead or alive,
you're coming with me!"

707
00:40:13,379 --> 00:40:15,246
You will recover, Wade.

708
00:40:15,248 --> 00:40:16,947
You always do.

709
00:40:21,354 --> 00:40:24,989
You ever see 127 Hours?
Spoiler alert.

710
00:40:28,695 --> 00:40:29,860
Oh, my God.

711
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:31,665
Nasty.

712
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:35,331
Oh, there's the money shot, Baby.

713
00:40:36,736 --> 00:40:38,469
Are You There God?
It's Me, Margaret.

714
00:40:49,449 --> 00:40:52,349
Rock, meet bottom.

715
00:40:52,351 --> 00:40:55,786
And when life ends up
breathtakingly fucked...

716
00:40:55,788 --> 00:40:59,990
You can generally trace it
back to one big, bad decision.

717
00:40:59,992 --> 00:41:03,194
The one that sent you
down the road to Shitsburgh.

718
00:41:03,196 --> 00:41:06,897
This? Well, this was mine.

719
00:41:06,899 --> 00:41:09,767
Mr. Wilson.

720
00:41:09,769 --> 00:41:14,205
Nothing warms my heart more than
a change of someone else's.

721
00:41:14,207 --> 00:41:16,040
You finally hit "Fuck it."

722
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:19,844
Just promise you'll do right
by me.

723
00:41:19,846 --> 00:41:21,912
So I can do right by someone else.

724
00:41:21,914 --> 00:41:23,814
Of course.

725
00:41:23,816 --> 00:41:25,516
And please don't make
the super suit green.

726
00:41:26,853 --> 00:41:28,319
Or animated.

727
00:41:34,861 --> 00:41:36,393
Move it! Keep moving.

728
00:41:48,407 --> 00:41:51,342
This place seems sanitary.

729
00:41:51,344 --> 00:41:53,544
My first request is warmer hands.

730
00:41:53,546 --> 00:41:57,448
Oh! And, Jesus, a warmer table.

731
00:41:59,018 --> 00:42:01,218
We should really come up
with a safe word, Fellas.

732
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,154
I'm thinking "Pork and Beans."

733
00:42:06,425 --> 00:42:08,559
Easy.

734
00:42:10,496 --> 00:42:12,963
Aren't you a little
strong for a lady?

735
00:42:13,533 --> 00:42:15,266
I'm calling wang.

736
00:42:18,971 --> 00:42:20,371
What's up with the matches?

737
00:42:20,373 --> 00:42:23,307
Oral fixation or just a big
Stallone fan?

738
00:42:24,577 --> 00:42:26,076
Patience, Angel.

739
00:42:26,979 --> 00:42:28,579
All in good time.

740
00:42:28,581 --> 00:42:30,581
Are you here for the turndown
service, or what?

741
00:42:32,185 --> 00:42:33,751
We have another talker.

742
00:42:33,752 --> 00:42:35,318
I'm just excited about my
first day at superhero camp.

743
00:42:35,321 --> 00:42:37,521
Shut the fuck up.

744
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:42,893
Mr. Wilson, my name's Ajax.

745
00:42:43,863 --> 00:42:46,997
I manage this workshop.

746
00:42:46,999 --> 00:42:50,267
Ah, my welcome speech used to
be full of euphemisms like...

747
00:42:50,269 --> 00:42:51,902
"This may hurt a little."

748
00:42:51,904 --> 00:42:53,971
"This may cause you some discomfort."

749
00:42:53,973 --> 00:42:56,273
But I've grown blunt.

750
00:42:56,275 --> 00:42:59,009
This workshop is not
a government led program.

751
00:42:59,011 --> 00:43:02,546
It's a private institution that turns
reclamation projects like yourself...

752
00:43:02,548 --> 00:43:06,083
Into men of extraordinary abilities.

753
00:43:07,553 --> 00:43:11,021
But if you think super human
powers are acquired painlessly...

754
00:43:11,891 --> 00:43:13,290
Wrong.

755
00:43:13,292 --> 00:43:14,959
I'm injecting you with a serum...

756
00:43:14,961 --> 00:43:17,561
That activates any mutant
genes lurking in your DNA.

757
00:43:17,563 --> 00:43:21,565
For it to work we need to
subject you to extreme stress.

758
00:43:27,073 --> 00:43:31,108
You've heard that whole "Make an
omelet, break some eggs" bit, right?

759
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:33,577
I'm about to hurt you, Wade.

760
00:43:33,579 --> 00:43:36,647
I was a patient here once
myself, you know.

761
00:43:36,649 --> 00:43:39,516
The treatment affects
everyone differently.

762
00:43:39,518 --> 00:43:42,653
It made Angel inhumanly strong.

763
00:43:42,655 --> 00:43:47,258
In my case, it enhanced my reflexes.

764
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:50,294
Also scorched my nerve endings,
so I no longer feel pain.

765
00:43:51,998 --> 00:43:55,933
And, in fact,
I no longer feel anything.

766
00:43:57,270 --> 00:43:58,936
(Mumbling)

767
00:44:04,277 --> 00:44:07,344
Thanks! Thank you. Thank you.

768
00:44:07,346 --> 00:44:10,080
You have something in your teeth.

769
00:44:10,082 --> 00:44:12,283
Right in the middle there.
Just, I don't...

770
00:44:12,285 --> 00:44:15,386
A little nugget of romaine
lettuce or something.

771
00:44:17,223 --> 00:44:19,690
It's been bothering me
for a long time.

772
00:44:21,127 --> 00:44:22,393
Ah, made you look.

773
00:44:22,395 --> 00:44:24,161
Hey, is Ajax your actual name?

774
00:44:24,163 --> 00:44:25,996
Because it sounds
suspiciously made up.

775
00:44:25,998 --> 00:44:27,131
What is it, really?

776
00:44:27,133 --> 00:44:29,400
Kevin? Bruce? Scott?

777
00:44:29,402 --> 00:44:31,702
Mitch? The Rickster?

778
00:44:31,704 --> 00:44:33,570
Is it Basil Fawlty?

779
00:44:33,572 --> 00:44:35,539
Oh, joke away.

780
00:44:35,541 --> 00:44:37,041
One thing that never
survives this place

781
00:44:37,043 --> 00:44:39,043
is a sense of humor.

782
00:44:39,045 --> 00:44:40,210
We'll see about that.

783
00:44:40,212 --> 00:44:41,578
I suppose we will.

784
00:44:43,049 --> 00:44:44,548
He's all yours.

785
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:46,317
Oh, come on.

786
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:47,718
You're gonna leave me
all alone here.

787
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,486
With less angry Rosie O'Donnell?

788
00:44:53,726 --> 00:44:56,026
This is how it's going to work.

789
00:44:56,028 --> 00:44:59,530
Adrenaline acts as a catalyst
for the serum...

790
00:44:59,532 --> 00:45:02,199
So we're going to have to
make you suffer.

791
00:45:03,736 --> 00:45:05,736
If you're lucky,
the mutant genes will activate

792
00:45:05,738 --> 00:45:08,672
and manifest in a spectacular fashion.

793
00:45:13,045 --> 00:45:15,746
If not, well, we'll
have to keep on hurting you...

794
00:45:17,583 --> 00:45:19,016
In new and different ways,

795
00:45:19,018 --> 00:45:20,417
each more painful than the last...

796
00:45:23,089 --> 00:45:25,422
Until you finally mutate.

797
00:45:27,059 --> 00:45:28,292
Or die.

798
00:45:35,101 --> 00:45:36,633
You mean a bucket list?

799
00:45:36,635 --> 00:45:39,103
Like a fuck it list.

800
00:45:39,105 --> 00:45:40,371
I'd really like to light a spliff

801
00:45:40,373 --> 00:45:42,306
off the Olympic torch.

802
00:45:42,308 --> 00:45:44,241
Pass it to me right after.

803
00:45:44,243 --> 00:45:47,644
Let's not forget naked
tandem base jumping

804
00:45:47,646 --> 00:45:51,248
with the WNBA's Sacramento Monarchs.

805
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:54,752
Anything on my bucket list
would involve public nudity.

806
00:45:54,754 --> 00:45:58,088
Finally, giving Meredith
Baxter-Birney a Dutch oven.

807
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:01,258
No. Receiving a Dutch oven
from Meredith Baxter-Birney.

808
00:46:05,731 --> 00:46:09,333
Making banana pancakes for my kids.

809
00:46:12,638 --> 00:46:14,738
Vanessa.

810
00:46:18,277 --> 00:46:20,611
I wanna see Vanessa.

811
00:46:20,613 --> 00:46:22,146
You're lovely.

812
00:46:22,148 --> 00:46:25,516
I don't know about anyone else,
but I'm touched.

813
00:46:25,518 --> 00:46:26,550
We were just joking.

814
00:46:26,552 --> 00:46:29,086
No, no. It's okay.

815
00:46:30,156 --> 00:46:32,523
I encourage distractions.

816
00:46:32,525 --> 00:46:34,825
Wouldn't want you giving up
on us, now would we?

817
00:46:34,827 --> 00:46:36,760
Hey, don't take any shit
from him, Cunningham.

818
00:46:37,696 --> 00:46:40,230
How tough can he be...

819
00:46:40,232 --> 00:46:43,233
With a name like Francis?

820
00:46:43,636 --> 00:46:45,169
Francis?

821
00:46:45,171 --> 00:46:47,171
That's his legal name.

822
00:46:47,173 --> 00:46:50,641
He got "Ajax" from the dish soap.

823
00:46:52,578 --> 00:46:56,346
F, R, A, N, C, I...

824
00:46:56,649 --> 00:46:58,215
Oops!

825
00:46:59,785 --> 00:47:02,753
Snagged the dry cleaning tag
off your lab coat.

826
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:07,191
FYI, I could probably get you
the superhero discount.

827
00:47:07,193 --> 00:47:08,559
You are so relentlessly annoying.

828
00:47:08,561 --> 00:47:09,593
Thanks.

829
00:47:09,595 --> 00:47:11,228
Never heard that before.

830
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:14,298
Why don't you do us all
a favor and shut the fuck up?

831
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:16,366
Or I'll sew your pretty mouth shut.

832
00:47:16,669 --> 00:47:18,135
Oh...

833
00:47:18,137 --> 00:47:19,736
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

834
00:47:19,738 --> 00:47:21,371
See, here's the problem with

835
00:47:21,373 --> 00:47:23,207
round the clock torture...

836
00:47:23,209 --> 00:47:26,243
Is that you can't really
step it up from there.

837
00:47:28,681 --> 00:47:31,215
Is that what you think?

838
00:47:36,355 --> 00:47:38,822
If this doesn't unlock
your mutation, then, well...

839
00:47:39,625 --> 00:47:41,425
Nothing will.

840
00:47:41,427 --> 00:47:42,943
Now, what we're going to do is

841
00:47:42,944 --> 00:47:44,460
lower the oxygen concentration
in the air...

842
00:47:44,463 --> 00:47:47,364
To the exact point you feel
like you're suffocating.

843
00:47:47,366 --> 00:47:48,632
If your brainwaves slow,

844
00:47:48,634 --> 00:47:51,235
meaning you're about to pass out...

845
00:47:51,237 --> 00:47:52,436
Then we'll turn up the O2.

846
00:47:53,372 --> 00:47:54,771
If your heart rate slows...

847
00:47:54,773 --> 00:47:57,574
Meaning you're able
to catch your breath...

848
00:47:57,576 --> 00:47:59,576
We'll turn it back down.

849
00:47:59,578 --> 00:48:01,245
And that's where we'll leave you.

850
00:48:01,247 --> 00:48:03,614
Right there.

851
00:48:03,616 --> 00:48:05,883
Oh, and I thought
you guys were dicks before.

852
00:48:05,885 --> 00:48:09,219
You know the funniest part of this?

853
00:48:09,221 --> 00:48:12,389
You still think we're making
you a superhero.

854
00:48:12,391 --> 00:48:15,826
You. A dishonorable discharge.

855
00:48:16,529 --> 00:48:18,662
Hip deep in hookers.

856
00:48:19,365 --> 00:48:20,931
You're nothing.

857
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,268
Little secret, Wade.

858
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:26,203
This workshop doesn't make superheroes,

859
00:48:26,205 --> 00:48:29,406
we make super slaves.

860
00:48:29,408 --> 00:48:31,241
We're gonna fit you
with a control collar

861
00:48:31,243 --> 00:48:33,810
and auction you off
to the highest bidder.

862
00:48:33,812 --> 00:48:36,213
Who knows what they'll have
you doing?

863
00:48:36,215 --> 00:48:39,616
Terrorizing citizens,
putting down freedom fighters.

864
00:48:41,687 --> 00:48:44,955
Maybe just mow the occasional lawn.

865
00:48:44,957 --> 00:48:47,624
What the fuck is wrong with you?

866
00:48:52,765 --> 00:48:55,666
You're never going home after this.

867
00:48:55,668 --> 00:48:57,901
Now there's a brave face.

868
00:48:58,837 --> 00:49:00,571
Wait, wait! Wait. Wait.

869
00:49:02,775 --> 00:49:06,777
Seriously, you actually have
something in your teeth now.

870
00:49:08,647 --> 00:49:10,447
Enjoy your weekend.

871
00:49:10,449 --> 00:49:12,249
"Weekend"? Back up.

872
00:49:12,251 --> 00:49:13,483
Weekend?

873
00:49:54,994 --> 00:49:57,294
Did I say this was a love story?

874
00:49:57,296 --> 00:49:59,696
No, it's a horror movie.

875
00:50:16,048 --> 00:50:18,382
Fucking hell.

876
00:50:18,384 --> 00:50:21,652
Looks like someone lost his
shot at Homecoming King.

877
00:50:21,654 --> 00:50:23,787
What have you done to me?

878
00:50:23,789 --> 00:50:25,322
I've merely raised your
stress levels

879
00:50:25,324 --> 00:50:27,057
high enough to trigger a mutation.

880
00:50:27,059 --> 00:50:29,926
You sadistic fuck!

881
00:50:29,928 --> 00:50:32,396
I've cured you, Wade.

882
00:50:32,398 --> 00:50:35,032
Now your mutated cells
can heal anything.

883
00:50:35,034 --> 00:50:37,868
It's attacking your cancer
as fast as it can form.

884
00:50:39,038 --> 00:50:41,738
Yeah, I've seen similar
side effects before.

885
00:50:42,941 --> 00:50:44,007
I could cure them...

886
00:50:47,646 --> 00:50:49,446
But where's the fun in that?

887
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:54,351
Now, I'm gonna shut you in
again, Wade.

888
00:50:55,921 --> 00:50:57,954
Not because I need to.

889
00:51:01,827 --> 00:51:03,694
Because I want to.

890
00:51:17,976 --> 00:51:19,576
Oh, well.

891
00:51:19,578 --> 00:51:20,811
Go ahead.

892
00:51:23,782 --> 00:51:25,649
Oh, you smell like shit.

893
00:51:26,819 --> 00:51:28,852
Whoa!

894
00:51:28,854 --> 00:51:30,821
Motherfucker.

895
00:51:30,823 --> 00:51:32,789
Hey, hey, hey.
It's all right, it's all right.

896
00:51:33,826 --> 00:51:35,826
I think we owe him that one, yeah?

897
00:51:35,828 --> 00:51:38,395
You take off. Go on.

898
00:51:38,964 --> 00:51:40,497
Off you go.

899
00:51:51,443 --> 00:51:53,009
Quick question.

900
00:51:55,147 --> 00:51:57,414
What's my name?

901
00:52:02,988 --> 00:52:04,521
Didn't think so.

902
00:52:06,158 --> 00:52:09,025
Sorry, Francis.
My lips are sealed.

903
00:53:14,226 --> 00:53:15,892
(Indistinct)

904
00:54:05,544 --> 00:54:06,877
You don't want to kill me.

905
00:54:06,879 --> 00:54:09,212
I'm the only one
who can fix your ugly mug.

906
00:55:05,938 --> 00:55:07,604
What's my name?

907
00:55:13,679 --> 00:55:14,878
Wade.

908
00:56:22,114 --> 00:56:25,215
I didn't just get
the cure to el cancer...

909
00:56:26,752 --> 00:56:29,352
I got the cure to el everything.

910
00:56:33,025 --> 00:56:35,258
But there was only one thing...

911
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:37,027
That really mattered.

912
00:56:39,965 --> 00:56:42,699
(Indistinct)

913
00:56:58,316 --> 00:57:00,717
(Indistinct)

914
00:57:06,324 --> 00:57:07,390
Come on, let's go.

915
00:57:12,864 --> 00:57:15,699
Oh, that must hurt.

916
00:57:16,435 --> 00:57:18,935
Thank you so much.

917
00:57:18,937 --> 00:57:20,937
(Indistinct)

918
00:57:29,948 --> 00:57:32,182
God, he's so fucking gnarly.

919
00:57:32,184 --> 00:57:33,750
Look at his face.

920
00:57:33,752 --> 00:57:36,086
Oh, my God. Poor guy.

921
00:57:36,088 --> 00:57:37,220
Honey, don't stare.

922
00:57:37,222 --> 00:57:38,488
Freak.

923
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:39,823
(Indistinct)

924
00:57:58,844 --> 00:58:02,345
No way. I'm not making
her life as ugly as mine.

925
00:58:02,347 --> 00:58:05,014
Come on, Wade,
it can't be that bad.

926
00:58:05,016 --> 00:58:07,384
Ah, bullshit!

927
00:58:07,385 --> 00:58:09,753
I'm a monster inside and out.
I belong in a fucking circus.

928
00:58:09,755 --> 00:58:12,288
Wade, Vanessa loves you.
She doesn't care what you...

929
00:58:12,290 --> 00:58:14,023
Oh! Oh.

930
00:58:14,025 --> 00:58:15,191
Do you like what you see?

931
00:58:15,193 --> 00:58:16,926
No.

932
00:58:16,928 --> 00:58:18,394
You look like an avocado

933
00:58:18,396 --> 00:58:20,964
had sex with an older,
more disgusting avocado.

934
00:58:20,966 --> 00:58:22,132
Yeah.

935
00:58:22,134 --> 00:58:24,200
Not gently.
Like it was hate fucking.

936
00:58:24,202 --> 00:58:26,136
There was something wrong
with the relationship...

937
00:58:26,138 --> 00:58:28,071
And that was the only catharsis

938
00:58:28,073 --> 00:58:29,973
that they could find without violence.

939
00:58:29,975 --> 00:58:32,375
And the only guy
who can fix this fugly mug...

940
00:58:32,377 --> 00:58:35,211
Is the British shitstick
who ran the mutant factory.

941
00:58:35,213 --> 00:58:37,147
And he's gone. Poof!

942
00:58:37,149 --> 00:58:38,982
Yeah, well you gotta do
something to remedy this...

943
00:58:38,984 --> 00:58:40,116
Because as of now,

944
00:58:40,118 --> 00:58:42,018
you only have one course of action.

945
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:43,253
Damn straight.

946
00:58:43,255 --> 00:58:45,121
Find Francis.
Star in horror films.

947
00:58:45,123 --> 00:58:46,222
What?

948
00:58:46,224 --> 00:58:48,291
Star in your own horror films.

949
00:58:48,293 --> 00:58:49,893
Because you look like Freddy Krueger

950
00:58:49,895 --> 00:58:53,129
face fucked a topographical
map of Utah.

951
00:58:53,131 --> 00:58:54,998
Here's what I'm actually
gonna do.

952
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,132
I'm gonna work through his crew

953
00:58:56,134 --> 00:58:58,118
until somebody gives up Francis...

954
00:58:58,119 --> 00:59:00,103
Force him to fix this, then
put a bullet in his skull...

955
00:59:00,105 --> 00:59:01,871
And fuck the brain hole.

956
00:59:01,873 --> 00:59:05,008
I don't wanna see that
or think of it again.

957
00:59:05,010 --> 00:59:07,110
But the douchebag does
thinks you're dead, right?

958
00:59:07,112 --> 00:59:08,378
Yeah.

959
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:09,913
That's good.
You should keep it that way.

960
00:59:09,915 --> 00:59:11,514
What, like, wear a mask?

961
00:59:11,516 --> 00:59:14,517
Yes. A very thick mask.
All the time.

962
00:59:15,153 --> 00:59:16,286
I am sorry...

963
00:59:16,288 --> 00:59:19,022
You are haunting.

964
00:59:19,024 --> 00:59:21,024
Your face is the stuff of nightmares.

965
00:59:21,026 --> 00:59:22,325
Like a testicle with teeth.

966
00:59:22,327 --> 00:59:24,160
You will die alone.

967
00:59:24,162 --> 00:59:26,329
I mean, if you could die.

968
00:59:26,331 --> 00:59:28,398
Ideally, for others' sake.

969
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:30,033
That'll do.

970
00:59:30,035 --> 00:59:31,901
All you need now is a suit
and a nickname...

971
00:59:31,903 --> 00:59:34,137
Like Wade the Wisecracker...

972
00:59:34,139 --> 00:59:37,273
Or Scaredevil, Mr. Neverdie.

973
00:59:37,909 --> 00:59:39,209
Oh, shit.

974
00:59:39,578 --> 00:59:41,544
What?

975
00:59:41,546 --> 00:59:43,580
I put all my money on you and now...

976
00:59:43,582 --> 00:59:45,181
I just realized I'm never
gonna win the, uh...

977
00:59:45,183 --> 00:59:46,282
Dead pool.

978
00:59:50,188 --> 00:59:52,488
Captain Deadpool...

979
00:59:54,326 --> 00:59:55,458
No, just...

980
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:57,293
Just Deadpool, yeah.
Just Deadpool.

981
00:59:57,295 --> 00:59:59,462
To you, Mr. Pool.

982
00:59:59,464 --> 01:00:00,864
Deadpool.

983
01:00:00,866 --> 01:00:02,165
That sounds like a fucking franchise.

984
01:00:16,581 --> 01:00:19,349
This shit's gonna have nuts
in it.

985
01:00:19,351 --> 01:00:20,984
Where's Francis?

986
01:00:34,966 --> 01:00:36,566
Where's Francis?

987
01:00:44,976 --> 01:00:47,010
Seltzer water and lemon for blood.

988
01:00:48,213 --> 01:00:51,180
Or wear red. Dumbass.

989
01:01:09,701 --> 01:01:11,334
Don't make me ask twice.

990
01:01:12,570 --> 01:01:14,137
Where...

991
01:01:14,139 --> 01:01:16,673
Is Francis?

992
01:01:16,675 --> 01:01:18,508
He made me ask twice.

993
01:01:18,510 --> 01:01:20,576
Is the mask muffling my voice?

994
01:01:25,317 --> 01:01:26,950
Where's Francis?

995
01:01:29,421 --> 01:01:31,354
Where the fuck is Francis?

996
01:01:40,031 --> 01:01:43,333
You're about to be killed
by a Zamboni.

997
01:01:43,335 --> 01:01:44,567
Where's Francis?

998
01:01:46,037 --> 01:01:47,670
No! Please!

999
01:01:47,672 --> 01:01:50,606
Oh, God! I'm so sorry!

1000
01:01:51,676 --> 01:01:54,577
Oh! You little spider monkey!

1001
01:01:57,449 --> 01:02:01,050
Where... Is... Francis?

1002
01:02:02,153 --> 01:02:03,353
This is confusing.

1003
01:02:03,355 --> 01:02:04,687
Is it sexist to hit you?

1004
01:02:04,689 --> 01:02:06,356
Is it more sexist to not hit you?

1005
01:02:06,358 --> 01:02:08,725
I mean, the line gets real... Blurry.

1006
01:02:08,727 --> 01:02:09,747
(Spanish)

1007
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,000
Where is Francis?

1008
01:02:12,497 --> 01:02:14,564
Tell me where your fucking
boss is

1009
01:02:14,566 --> 01:02:16,432
or you're gonna die!

1010
01:02:16,434 --> 01:02:18,167
In five minutes!

1011
01:02:27,213 --> 01:02:30,113
Don't hesitate to call me.

1012
01:02:45,530 --> 01:02:47,730
Nice to see you, Jared.

1013
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,633
I'll take the footlong...

1014
01:02:50,635 --> 01:02:51,701
Fully loaded.

1015
01:03:05,784 --> 01:03:07,350
Whoa, whoa!

1016
01:03:07,352 --> 01:03:09,085
41 confirmed kills.

1017
01:03:09,087 --> 01:03:11,454
Now it's 89.
About to be 90.

1018
01:03:12,223 --> 01:03:13,356
Mr. Wilson?

1019
01:03:13,358 --> 01:03:14,457
Ding ding.

1020
01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:17,560
You're looking very alive.

1021
01:03:17,562 --> 01:03:19,829
Ha! Only on the outside!

1022
01:03:19,831 --> 01:03:21,497
This is not going to
end well for me, is it?

1023
01:03:21,499 --> 01:03:22,799
This is not gonna
end well for you, no.

1024
01:03:22,801 --> 01:03:24,167
Where's your boss?

1025
01:03:24,169 --> 01:03:25,668
I can tell you exactly...

1026
01:03:27,439 --> 01:03:29,806
Oh, you'll tell me.
But first...

1027
01:03:29,808 --> 01:03:32,275
You might wanna look away for this.

1028
01:03:32,277 --> 01:03:33,576
Now this little piggy went to...

1029
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:38,081
Thank you, Agent Smith.

1030
01:03:41,519 --> 01:03:42,585
Taxi!

1031
01:03:44,122 --> 01:03:46,422
Hop in! Great day for a ride.

1032
01:03:48,293 --> 01:03:49,933
And we all know how this
turned out.

1033
01:03:52,564 --> 01:03:54,797
Whoops!
You weren't meant to see that.

1034
01:04:02,707 --> 01:04:04,874
There. All caught up.

1035
01:04:12,550 --> 01:04:15,151
We're here.

1036
01:04:15,153 --> 01:04:18,521
Sorry about bleeding in all
your garbage.

1037
01:04:24,696 --> 01:04:26,796
Seltzer water and lemon for blood.

1038
01:04:27,298 --> 01:04:28,865
Whoo!

1039
01:04:28,867 --> 01:04:31,567
Some kinds of anger can't be managed...

1040
01:04:31,569 --> 01:04:33,736
Like the kind where
your year long plan

1041
01:04:33,738 --> 01:04:37,340
ends with the wrong guy
getting dismembered!

1042
01:04:37,342 --> 01:04:40,243
That said, when it comes time
to licking wounds,

1043
01:04:40,245 --> 01:04:42,478
there's no place like home.

1044
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,580
Ah, and I share that home
with someone you've met,

1045
01:04:44,582 --> 01:04:47,350
the old blind lady
from the laundromat, Al.

1046
01:04:47,352 --> 01:04:49,252
God, I miss cocaine.

1047
01:04:49,254 --> 01:04:51,738
Her.

1048
01:04:51,739 --> 01:04:54,223
Fourth wall break
inside a fourth wall break.

1049
01:04:54,225 --> 01:04:57,326
That's like 16 walls.

1050
01:04:57,328 --> 01:04:58,794
She's like Robin to my Batman,

1051
01:04:58,796 --> 01:05:02,732
except she's old, and black,
and blind.

1052
01:05:02,734 --> 01:05:04,767
And I think she's in love
with me.

1053
01:05:04,769 --> 01:05:08,371
Wait, pretty sure
Robin loves Batman, too.

1054
01:05:18,283 --> 01:05:19,348
Al?

1055
01:05:21,619 --> 01:05:23,219
Morning, Sleepyhead.

1056
01:05:24,522 --> 01:05:26,689
It smells like
old lady pants in here.

1057
01:05:26,691 --> 01:05:28,691
Yes, I'm old.
I wear pants.

1058
01:05:28,693 --> 01:05:30,560
But you're no lady.

1059
01:05:30,562 --> 01:05:33,829
Oh! So comfy.

1060
01:05:33,831 --> 01:05:36,899
Upside of being blind:
I've never seen you in Crocs.

1061
01:05:36,901 --> 01:05:38,434
You mean my big,
rubber masturbating shoes?

1062
01:05:38,436 --> 01:05:39,936
Yes, I know.

1063
01:05:39,938 --> 01:05:42,705
Downside of being blind...

1064
01:05:42,707 --> 01:05:45,274
I hear everything in this duplex.

1065
01:05:47,312 --> 01:05:48,544
Sit on a stick.

1066
01:05:48,546 --> 01:05:49,579
Bactin?

1067
01:05:49,581 --> 01:05:53,716
Yeah. Bactin should do it.

1068
01:05:54,786 --> 01:05:56,586
How's that Kullen coming along?

1069
01:05:56,588 --> 01:05:58,688
IKEA doesn't assemble itself,
you know.

1070
01:05:58,690 --> 01:06:01,691
You're telling me.
I don't mind the Kullen.

1071
01:06:01,693 --> 01:06:04,327
It's an improvement on the Hurdal.

1072
01:06:04,329 --> 01:06:06,862
Please. Anything's an
improvement over the Hurdal.

1073
01:06:06,864 --> 01:06:10,967
I'd have taken an Hemnes
or a Trysil over the Hurdal.

1074
01:06:10,969 --> 01:06:13,836
Oh, no, I didn't get excited
till I saw the Kullen.

1075
01:06:13,838 --> 01:06:15,004
Screw, please.

1076
01:06:15,006 --> 01:06:16,572
Here? Now?
Just kidding.

1077
01:06:16,574 --> 01:06:17,740
I know it's been decades.

1078
01:06:17,742 --> 01:06:18,908
You'd be surprised.

1079
01:06:19,611 --> 01:06:20,776
Pretty grossed out.

1080
01:06:22,714 --> 01:06:25,281
Ta... Da.

1081
01:06:30,855 --> 01:06:34,490
I wish I never heard of Craigslist.

1082
01:06:34,492 --> 01:06:35,758
And I quote, "Looking for roommate,

1083
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,026
"blind to life's imperfections.

1084
01:06:37,028 --> 01:06:38,811
"Must be good with hands."

1085
01:06:38,812 --> 01:06:40,595
Or would you rather I build
the IKEA, and you pay rent?

1086
01:06:40,598 --> 01:06:42,565
Why such a douche this morning?

1087
01:06:43,334 --> 01:06:45,034
Let's recap.

1088
01:06:45,035 --> 01:06:46,735
The cock thistle that
turned me into this freak...

1089
01:06:46,738 --> 01:06:48,537
Slipped through my arms today...

1090
01:06:50,008 --> 01:06:51,707
Arm.

1091
01:06:51,709 --> 01:06:53,042
Catching him was my only chance

1092
01:06:53,044 --> 01:06:54,877
to be hot again, get my super
sexy ex back...

1093
01:06:54,879 --> 01:06:57,346
And prevent this shit from
happening to someone else.

1094
01:06:57,348 --> 01:06:59,348
So, yeah,
today was about as much fun

1095
01:06:59,350 --> 01:07:00,983
as a sandpaper dildo.

1096
01:07:02,887 --> 01:07:04,553
#Driveby.

1097
01:07:21,906 --> 01:07:23,939
Found out who our friend
in the red suit is.

1098
01:07:26,377 --> 01:07:29,045
Fucking Wade Wilson.

1099
01:07:29,047 --> 01:07:32,048
I suppose I'd wear a mask too
if I had a face like that.

1100
01:07:32,050 --> 01:07:33,716
I only wish I healed the same.

1101
01:07:37,655 --> 01:07:40,523
Still, we'll put him
out of our misery.

1102
01:07:40,525 --> 01:07:42,024
On our terms.

1103
01:07:42,026 --> 01:07:43,893
Right.
And when he heals?

1104
01:07:44,829 --> 01:07:46,028
He can't.

1105
01:07:46,030 --> 01:07:48,664
Not if there's nothing
left of him to heal.

1106
01:07:48,666 --> 01:07:52,702
You know, it's funny.
I almost miss the fucker.

1107
01:07:54,005 --> 01:07:55,604
I like a challenge.

1108
01:07:56,841 --> 01:07:58,974
But he's bad for business.

1109
01:07:58,976 --> 01:08:00,810
Now let's go find him.

1110
01:08:01,679 --> 01:08:02,745
Oh.

1111
01:08:05,116 --> 01:08:06,716
Tylenol PM?

1112
01:08:06,718 --> 01:08:09,618
You can stick that
where you stuck the Bactin.

1113
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:11,987
I raided my stash
of wisdom tooth Percocet...

1114
01:08:11,989 --> 01:08:16,058
And I am orbiting
fucking Saturn right now.

1115
01:08:18,863 --> 01:08:21,831
But I appreciate the gesture.

1116
01:08:21,833 --> 01:08:26,435
Am I crazy,
or is your hand really small?

1117
01:08:26,437 --> 01:08:28,471
About the size of a KFC spork.

1118
01:08:28,473 --> 01:08:30,373
Ugh.

1119
01:08:30,375 --> 01:08:32,608
I get why you're so pissy...

1120
01:08:32,610 --> 01:08:34,143
But your mood's never gonna brighten

1121
01:08:34,145 --> 01:08:35,611
till you find this woman...

1122
01:08:35,613 --> 01:08:36,979
And tell her how you feel.

1123
01:08:36,981 --> 01:08:38,681
What do I keep telling you,
Mrs. Magoo?

1124
01:08:38,683 --> 01:08:40,516
She wouldn't have me.

1125
01:08:40,518 --> 01:08:42,151
If you could see me, you'd understand.

1126
01:08:42,153 --> 01:08:43,486
Looks aren't everything.

1127
01:08:43,488 --> 01:08:44,620
Looks are everything.

1128
01:08:44,622 --> 01:08:46,722
You ever heard David Beckham speak?

1129
01:08:46,724 --> 01:08:49,058
It's like he mouth sexed
a can of helium.

1130
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:50,626
You think Ryan Reynolds
got this far

1131
01:08:50,628 --> 01:08:52,495
on his superior acting method?

1132
01:08:52,497 --> 01:08:53,763
Love is blind, Wade.

1133
01:08:53,765 --> 01:08:54,830
No.

1134
01:08:55,867 --> 01:08:57,800
You're blind.

1135
01:08:57,802 --> 01:09:00,770
So, you're just gonna
lie there and whimper?

1136
01:09:00,772 --> 01:09:02,872
No, I'm gonna wait till this
arm plows through puberty...

1137
01:09:02,874 --> 01:09:03,906
And then I'm gonna come up with

1138
01:09:03,908 --> 01:09:05,108
a whole new Christmas Day plan.

1139
01:09:05,810 --> 01:09:07,076
In the meantime,

1140
01:09:07,078 --> 01:09:09,078
you might wanna leave the room.

1141
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:11,680
I bet it feels huge in this hand.

1142
01:09:12,917 --> 01:09:16,085
Go, go, go.
Go. go. go.

1143
01:09:16,087 --> 01:09:17,887
So, the doctor says,
"The bad news is

1144
01:09:17,889 --> 01:09:19,339
"You don't have that long to live."

1145
01:09:19,340 --> 01:09:20,790
So, the patient says,
"How long do I have?"

1146
01:09:20,792 --> 01:09:22,758
The doctor says, "Five."

1147
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:24,493
The guy says, "Five what?"

1148
01:09:24,495 --> 01:09:27,696
And the doctor says,
"Four, three, two..."

1149
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:37,039
Can I help you Ladies?

1150
01:09:39,677 --> 01:09:40,843
Oh, I do hope so.

1151
01:09:44,949 --> 01:09:46,582
I heard you might be
able to point me

1152
01:09:46,584 --> 01:09:49,685
in the direction of a, um,
friend of mine.

1153
01:09:49,687 --> 01:09:50,753
Name of Wade Wilson.

1154
01:09:52,123 --> 01:09:53,456
Sorry.

1155
01:09:53,458 --> 01:09:54,990
I don't know the name.

1156
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:04,733
Hey, you're not supposed
to be behind the bar.

1157
01:10:08,239 --> 01:10:10,206
I've seen this girl.

1158
01:10:10,208 --> 01:10:11,707
Ah, this must be Vanessa.

1159
01:10:11,709 --> 01:10:12,908
I've heard so much about you.

1160
01:10:17,114 --> 01:10:19,882
Um, Sweetheart,
you might wanna look around.

1161
01:10:19,884 --> 01:10:22,651
This isn't really the place
to do something like that.

1162
01:10:23,888 --> 01:10:25,721
Easy, Angel.

1163
01:10:25,723 --> 01:10:27,089
Put the little man down.

1164
01:10:28,693 --> 01:10:30,826
We have everything we need now.

1165
01:10:30,828 --> 01:10:32,628
You sure?

1166
01:10:32,630 --> 01:10:35,731
You don't want any clothes
that are not monochromatic?

1167
01:10:35,733 --> 01:10:38,534
Have fun at your midnight
showing of Blade II.

1168
01:10:40,605 --> 01:10:42,004
Whoo.

1169
01:10:42,006 --> 01:10:43,839
Thanks for having my back, Guys.

1170
01:10:48,779 --> 01:10:51,146
Wade, we have a fucking problem.

1171
01:10:51,148 --> 01:10:53,916
And by "We," I mean "You."

1172
01:10:53,918 --> 01:10:56,051
Ah, I can't believe I'm doing this.

1173
01:10:56,053 --> 01:10:58,988
Is there a word for
half afraid, half angry?

1174
01:10:58,990 --> 01:11:01,156
Yeah, "Afrangry",
I guess.

1175
01:11:01,158 --> 01:11:03,025
Have you decided what
you're gonna say to her?

1176
01:11:03,027 --> 01:11:04,293
Fuck me!

1177
01:11:04,295 --> 01:11:06,295
Uh, maybe not start with that.

1178
01:11:12,136 --> 01:11:15,604
Hey, coming onto our stage
right now...

1179
01:11:15,606 --> 01:11:17,806
Give it up for Chastity!

1180
01:11:21,612 --> 01:11:23,913
Or as I like to call her, Irony.

1181
01:11:23,915 --> 01:11:26,048
Better find her fast
before numbnuts does.

1182
01:11:26,050 --> 01:11:27,683
How do you know she's in here?

1183
01:11:27,685 --> 01:11:30,853
Because I'm constantly
stalking that fox.

1184
01:11:55,813 --> 01:12:00,082
Every time I see her,
it's like the first time...

1185
01:12:00,084 --> 01:12:02,284
Especially from this angle.

1186
01:12:25,810 --> 01:12:27,109
You can't buy love,

1187
01:12:27,111 --> 01:12:29,912
but you can rent it for three minutes.

1188
01:12:32,850 --> 01:12:35,651
Ah, you weak motherfucker!

1189
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:37,286
Come on!

1190
01:12:38,389 --> 01:12:39,855
Come on, get it together.

1191
01:12:39,857 --> 01:12:41,924
This isn't about me,
this is about Vanessa.

1192
01:12:45,963 --> 01:12:47,296
Here we go.

1193
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:51,667
Maximum effort.

1194
01:12:55,006 --> 01:12:56,171
Vanessa.

1195
01:12:58,743 --> 01:13:00,743
Someone out back asking for you.

1196
01:13:00,745 --> 01:13:02,911
Something about, uh,
an old boyfriend.

1197
01:13:30,141 --> 01:13:31,273
I knew it was you.

1198
01:13:33,077 --> 01:13:35,110
The weird, curvy edges.

1199
01:13:36,681 --> 01:13:38,414
Like a jigsaw puzzle.

1200
01:13:48,426 --> 01:13:50,392
You have Wade Wilson
to thank for this.

1201
01:13:59,336 --> 01:14:01,070
Hey. Hey! Where'd she go?

1202
01:14:01,072 --> 01:14:03,038
Uh, I saw her head to the back.

1203
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:04,406
Go get her, Tiger.

1204
01:14:27,364 --> 01:14:29,865
Fuck. Fuck!

1205
01:14:32,369 --> 01:14:34,203
Motherfucker!

1206
01:14:34,205 --> 01:14:35,337
Wait, wait.
Let's... Just...

1207
01:14:35,339 --> 01:14:36,405
Cock juggling...

1208
01:14:36,406 --> 01:14:37,472
We can talk about what we're gonna...

1209
01:14:37,475 --> 01:14:38,507
Jiminy! Fuck face!

1210
01:14:38,509 --> 01:14:39,942
Okay, or you can hit that.

1211
01:14:39,944 --> 01:14:41,844
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Fuck! Fuck!

1212
01:14:41,846 --> 01:14:43,212
No, no.
All right. Hey!

1213
01:14:43,214 --> 01:14:44,980
Fuck! Fuck!

1214
01:14:44,982 --> 01:14:46,515
Fuck!
Hey, um...

1215
01:14:46,517 --> 01:14:49,118
Whoa! Whoa!
Relax. Relax. Okay.

1216
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:50,419
Okay. I think that's a good start.

1217
01:14:50,421 --> 01:14:52,488
Oh, I'm gonna rip his motherfucking...

1218
01:14:52,490 --> 01:14:53,756
Wait.

1219
01:14:53,758 --> 01:14:55,224
Find it! Find it.
What?

1220
01:14:55,226 --> 01:14:57,092
I'm gonna get angry.
Okay. All right.

1221
01:14:57,094 --> 01:14:58,961
All right. Okay. All right.

1222
01:14:58,963 --> 01:15:00,262
Here. This is Vanessa.

1223
01:15:00,264 --> 01:15:02,297
What?
No, wait. It's Francis.

1224
01:15:02,299 --> 01:15:05,100
He wants you to come to him.

1225
01:15:05,102 --> 01:15:06,869
What is that?
That's the shit emoji.

1226
01:15:06,871 --> 01:15:09,004
You know, it's the turd with
the smiling face and the eyes?

1227
01:15:09,006 --> 01:15:11,340
I thought it was chocolate
yogurt for so long.

1228
01:15:12,042 --> 01:15:13,275
I need guns.

1229
01:15:13,277 --> 01:15:14,409
Okay, which ones?

1230
01:15:14,411 --> 01:15:15,544
I need all the guns!

1231
01:15:15,546 --> 01:15:17,012
All right. Okay.

1232
01:15:37,468 --> 01:15:39,101
That's about 3,000 rounds.

1233
01:15:40,037 --> 01:15:42,404
We all know what I can do
with 12.

1234
01:15:42,406 --> 01:15:44,573
Hey, hey, careful with that,
Ronnie Milsap!

1235
01:15:44,575 --> 01:15:45,941
We're downrange.

1236
01:15:47,211 --> 01:15:48,877
I was gonna spend the night

1237
01:15:48,879 --> 01:15:52,014
assembling the Borje,
but this is holding my interest.

1238
01:15:52,016 --> 01:15:54,917
I told you, we're going with
the Urvaj, not the Borje.

1239
01:15:54,919 --> 01:15:56,919
Get it through your head
or get out of fuck town.

1240
01:15:56,921 --> 01:15:59,588
Shit. That's all the pieces
in the house.

1241
01:15:59,590 --> 01:16:01,924
Nah, nah... Come on.
Let's go. Cough it up.

1242
01:16:01,926 --> 01:16:03,392
Up, up, up.

1243
01:16:04,428 --> 01:16:05,961
Oh. Down, down, down.

1244
01:16:05,963 --> 01:16:07,029
Fuck you.

1245
01:16:08,833 --> 01:16:11,533
.45 cal. I like it.

1246
01:16:13,571 --> 01:16:15,003
Wade...

1247
01:16:16,106 --> 01:16:18,974
I'd go with you,
but I don't want to.

1248
01:16:22,046 --> 01:16:23,345
Uh...

1249
01:16:23,347 --> 01:16:24,546
Listen, Al...

1250
01:16:25,516 --> 01:16:28,183
If I never see you again,

1251
01:16:28,185 --> 01:16:31,620
I want you to know that
I love you very much.

1252
01:16:31,622 --> 01:16:35,490
And also, uh, there's
about 116 kilos of cocaine

1253
01:16:35,492 --> 01:16:37,025
buried somewhere in the apartment...

1254
01:16:37,027 --> 01:16:39,862
Right next to the cure
for blindness. Good luck.

1255
01:16:45,202 --> 01:16:46,635
You wanna get fucked up?

1256
01:16:51,542 --> 01:16:54,076
(Indistinct)

1257
01:16:54,945 --> 01:16:56,511
(Mumbling)

1258
01:16:56,513 --> 01:16:58,180
Put her down over here.

1259
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:05,187
(Mumbling)

1260
01:17:08,259 --> 01:17:09,491
Go on then.

1261
01:17:11,996 --> 01:17:14,997
Thanks, dickless.
And I mean you.

1262
01:17:14,999 --> 01:17:18,300
Wow. You're a talker too.
You and Wade.

1263
01:17:18,302 --> 01:17:20,135
I've been trying to tell you assholes,

1264
01:17:20,137 --> 01:17:21,536
you've got the wrong girl.

1265
01:17:21,538 --> 01:17:23,238
My old boyfriend, he's dead.

1266
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:27,009
See, I thought that too.
But he keeps on coming back.

1267
01:17:27,011 --> 01:17:28,277
Like a cockroach...

1268
01:17:28,279 --> 01:17:30,545
But uglier.

1269
01:17:30,547 --> 01:17:35,183
Now, I may not feel, but he does.

1270
01:17:35,185 --> 01:17:37,225
Let's see how he fights
with your head on the block.

1271
01:17:46,063 --> 01:17:47,529
Ripley, from Alien 3!

1272
01:17:48,165 --> 01:17:50,132
Fuck, you're old.

1273
01:17:51,568 --> 01:17:54,036
Fake laugh.
Hiding real pain.

1274
01:17:54,038 --> 01:17:55,370
Go get Silver Balls.

1275
01:17:55,372 --> 01:17:57,940
You guys going for a bite?
Early bird special?

1276
01:17:57,942 --> 01:17:59,174
Oh, like there's something wrong

1277
01:17:59,176 --> 01:18:00,709
with eating before sundown
or saving money.

1278
01:18:00,711 --> 01:18:04,246
No, you know that bad guy
that you let go?

1279
01:18:04,682 --> 01:18:06,615
He's got my girl.

1280
01:18:06,617 --> 01:18:08,450
You're gonna help me get her back.

1281
01:18:08,452 --> 01:18:10,352
Wade, is that you?

1282
01:18:10,354 --> 01:18:12,020
Yeah, it's me, Deadpool,

1283
01:18:12,022 --> 01:18:14,957
and I got an offer
that you can't refuse.

1284
01:18:17,461 --> 01:18:18,560
I'm gonna wait out here, okay?

1285
01:18:18,562 --> 01:18:20,128
It's a big house.

1286
01:18:20,130 --> 01:18:21,964
It's funny that I only
ever see two of you.

1287
01:18:21,966 --> 01:18:24,247
It's almost like the studio
couldn't afford another X-Man.

1288
01:18:27,604 --> 01:18:29,237
And that is why, in my opinion...

1289
01:18:29,239 --> 01:18:32,975
the movie Cocoon is pure pornography.

1290
01:18:32,977 --> 01:18:34,643
Who brought this twinkly man?

1291
01:18:34,645 --> 01:18:36,745
Twinkly, but deadly.

1292
01:18:36,747 --> 01:18:39,348
My chrome penised friend back there

1293
01:18:39,350 --> 01:18:41,450
has agreed to do me this solid.

1294
01:18:41,452 --> 01:18:43,452
In exchange, I said that I would

1295
01:18:43,454 --> 01:18:45,487
consider joining his boy band.

1296
01:18:45,489 --> 01:18:46,755
It's not boy band.

1297
01:18:46,757 --> 01:18:48,590
Sure it's not.

1298
01:18:48,592 --> 01:18:51,626
So, any luck winning Gita back?

1299
01:18:51,628 --> 01:18:54,229
I tried to hold on tight,
Mr. Pool...

1300
01:18:54,231 --> 01:18:58,467
But Bandhu is more craftier
and handsomer than me.

1301
01:18:58,469 --> 01:19:00,302
Well, I think you're pretty
darn cute.

1302
01:19:06,143 --> 01:19:07,709
Dopinder.
Hmm?

1303
01:19:09,113 --> 01:19:10,178
What was that?

1304
01:19:10,748 --> 01:19:12,147
Uh...

1305
01:19:12,149 --> 01:19:17,719
That was Bandhu in the trunk.

1306
01:19:18,389 --> 01:19:20,456
Ban who?

1307
01:19:20,457 --> 01:19:22,524
My romantic rival Bandhu.
He's tied up in the trunk.

1308
01:19:22,526 --> 01:19:24,292
I'm doing as you said, DP.

1309
01:19:24,294 --> 01:19:26,294
I plan to gut him
like a tandoori fish,

1310
01:19:26,296 --> 01:19:28,196
then dump his carcass
on Gita's doorstep.

1311
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:31,166
I did not tell him to do that.

1312
01:19:31,168 --> 01:19:33,769
Absolutely not.
It got lost in translation.

1313
01:19:33,771 --> 01:19:37,172
Dopinder, this is no way
to win Gita's heart back!

1314
01:19:37,174 --> 01:19:38,807
I'm so proud of you.

1315
01:19:38,808 --> 01:19:40,441
Drop Bandhu off,
safe and gentle like.

1316
01:19:40,444 --> 01:19:41,510
Kill him.

1317
01:19:41,512 --> 01:19:43,678
And then, win Gita back...

1318
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:46,548
The old fashioned way:
with your boyish charm.

1319
01:19:46,550 --> 01:19:48,150
Kidnap her.

1320
01:19:49,453 --> 01:19:50,652
He's super dead.

1321
01:19:51,188 --> 01:19:52,254
Whoa!

1322
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:57,692
I presume a crisp high five?

1323
01:19:57,694 --> 01:20:00,562
For you? Ten.

1324
01:20:00,564 --> 01:20:03,432
Okay, guys, let's get out
there and make a difference.

1325
01:20:03,434 --> 01:20:05,400
You know what to do.

1326
01:20:06,303 --> 01:20:09,071
Knock 'em dead, Pool Boy!

1327
01:20:10,174 --> 01:20:12,240
Time to make
the chimi fuckin' changas.

1328
01:20:13,577 --> 01:20:15,310
Not often a dude ruins your face...

1329
01:20:15,312 --> 01:20:18,313
Skull stomps your sanity,
grabs your future baby mama...

1330
01:20:18,315 --> 01:20:20,082
And personally sees to four

1331
01:20:20,084 --> 01:20:22,484
of your five shittiest moments.

1332
01:20:22,486 --> 01:20:26,688
Let's just say it's beginning
to look a lot like Christmas.

1333
01:20:39,603 --> 01:20:41,103
Hey.

1334
01:20:41,105 --> 01:20:42,404
Where's your duffle bag?

1335
01:21:01,225 --> 01:21:04,192
Bandhu?

1336
01:21:04,194 --> 01:21:06,261
Leave a message
and have a happy day.

1337
01:21:06,263 --> 01:21:07,629
God damn it!

1338
01:21:07,631 --> 01:21:09,397
I'm gonna do this
the old fashioned way...

1339
01:21:09,399 --> 01:21:12,834
With two swords and maximum effort.

1340
01:21:13,770 --> 01:21:14,870
Cue the music.

1341
01:21:30,921 --> 01:21:33,922
Wade Wilson!

1342
01:21:33,924 --> 01:21:35,657
What's my name?

1343
01:21:35,659 --> 01:21:37,859
Ooh, I'mma fuckin'
spell it out for ya.

1344
01:21:40,230 --> 01:21:41,363
Go get some.

1345
01:21:41,365 --> 01:21:42,531
Superhero landing.

1346
01:21:42,533 --> 01:21:43,665
She's gonna do a superhero landing.

1347
01:21:43,667 --> 01:21:44,733
Wait for it.

1348
01:21:47,938 --> 01:21:49,237
Whoo!

1349
01:21:49,239 --> 01:21:50,805
Superhero landing!

1350
01:21:50,807 --> 01:21:52,307
You know, that's really
hard on your knees.

1351
01:21:52,309 --> 01:21:54,276
Totally impractical.
They all do it.

1352
01:21:54,278 --> 01:21:57,546
You're a lovely lady, but
I'm saving myself for Francis.

1353
01:21:57,548 --> 01:21:58,847
That's why I brought him.

1354
01:21:58,849 --> 01:22:02,184
I prefer not to hit a woman,
so please play...

1355
01:22:09,293 --> 01:22:12,394
I mean, that's why I brought her?

1356
01:22:13,797 --> 01:22:15,964
Oh, no, finish your tweet.
It's not... That's...

1357
01:22:15,966 --> 01:22:17,666
Just give us a second.
Yeah.

1358
01:22:17,668 --> 01:22:19,201
There you go.
Hashtag it.

1359
01:22:20,437 --> 01:22:22,370
Go get her, Tiger.

1360
01:22:28,845 --> 01:22:32,681
Oh, I so pity the dude who
pressures her into prom sex.

1361
01:22:33,417 --> 01:22:35,217
All right, then. Fire!

1362
01:22:46,630 --> 01:22:48,363
Finish fucking her the fuck up!

1363
01:22:48,365 --> 01:22:49,464
Language, please.

1364
01:22:49,466 --> 01:22:50,699
Suck a cock.

1365
01:23:16,627 --> 01:23:18,426
Look away, Child.

1366
01:23:18,929 --> 01:23:20,462
Look away!

1367
01:23:27,671 --> 01:23:29,004
Wait!

1368
01:23:29,006 --> 01:23:30,338
Wait!

1369
01:23:30,340 --> 01:23:31,373
Cease fire!

1370
01:23:31,375 --> 01:23:32,674
Cease fire!

1371
01:23:32,676 --> 01:23:34,309
Fellas! Hey! Hey!

1372
01:23:35,545 --> 01:23:39,381
You only work for that
shit spackled muppet fart.

1373
01:23:39,383 --> 01:23:41,549
So, I'mma give you a chance

1374
01:23:41,551 --> 01:23:43,418
for y'all to lay down your firearms...

1375
01:23:43,420 --> 01:23:46,488
In exchange for preferential,
bordering on gentle...

1376
01:23:46,490 --> 01:23:50,058
Possibly even lover like treatment.

1377
01:23:51,895 --> 01:23:53,061
Fine.

1378
01:23:53,063 --> 01:23:54,362
Commando!

1379
01:25:06,370 --> 01:25:07,502
Teabag!

1380
01:25:11,875 --> 01:25:12,941
Bob?

1381
01:25:13,877 --> 01:25:15,127
Wade?

1382
01:25:15,128 --> 01:25:16,378
Oh, my God,
I haven't seen you since...

1383
01:25:16,380 --> 01:25:18,680
Jacksonville. Fridays.
Since TGI Fridays.

1384
01:25:19,483 --> 01:25:21,716
Well, what the hell!

1385
01:25:21,718 --> 01:25:23,385
God, come here, you.

1386
01:25:25,455 --> 01:25:27,856
How are the kids?
Good?

1387
01:25:27,858 --> 01:25:29,691
And Gail, she still fixing
that tuna casserole?

1388
01:25:29,693 --> 01:25:31,526
So good.
But bad for the waistline,

1389
01:25:31,528 --> 01:25:32,888
if you know what I'm talking about.

1390
01:25:37,167 --> 01:25:39,401
Oh!

1391
01:25:39,403 --> 01:25:42,737
Your... On the left.
You are beautiful woman.

1392
01:25:42,739 --> 01:25:44,005
That is so sweet.

1393
01:25:44,007 --> 01:25:45,140
Uh...

1394
01:25:45,142 --> 01:25:46,408
Thanks.

1395
01:25:53,188 --> 01:25:55,254
Yoo hoo!

1396
01:25:57,255 --> 01:26:00,021
Does he write you notes too?

1397
01:26:00,023 --> 01:26:02,424
He's such a romantic.

1398
01:26:02,426 --> 01:26:03,826
Don't worry, Baby.
I'm comin'.

1399
01:26:05,028 --> 01:26:06,561
Fire!

1400
01:26:13,770 --> 01:26:15,537
Hey!

1401
01:26:15,539 --> 01:26:16,604
Climb on!

1402
01:26:53,577 --> 01:26:55,076
Motherfucking...

1403
01:27:06,490 --> 01:27:08,957
Motherfucker should have
worn his brown pants.

1404
01:27:11,728 --> 01:27:12,927
You were right, Beautiful.

1405
01:27:13,763 --> 01:27:15,630
Red really is my color.

1406
01:27:16,132 --> 01:27:17,265
Wade?

1407
01:27:17,267 --> 01:27:18,733
Don't worry, Baby...

1408
01:27:18,735 --> 01:27:21,135
I'mma get you out of that
shit box.

1409
01:27:21,137 --> 01:27:23,571
What better way to crawl back
inside that head of yours?

1410
01:27:23,573 --> 01:27:25,507
Oh, you never left.

1411
01:27:25,509 --> 01:27:27,642
But you did, Asshole!

1412
01:27:27,644 --> 01:27:29,077
Ah, deep breath, Darling.

1413
01:27:30,647 --> 01:27:31,813
Oh, wait.

1414
01:27:32,849 --> 01:27:34,549
Wrong choice of words.

1415
01:27:37,586 --> 01:27:39,586
I hope they blocked pain
to your every last nerve.

1416
01:27:39,589 --> 01:27:40,722
'Cause I'mma go lookin'!

1417
01:27:41,992 --> 01:27:44,626
I hear you grow back
body parts now, Wade.

1418
01:27:44,628 --> 01:27:45,727
When I'm finished...

1419
01:27:45,729 --> 01:27:47,629
Parts will have to grow back you.

1420
01:27:47,631 --> 01:27:48,796
Good one.

1421
01:27:49,666 --> 01:27:51,599
Yep, that was a good one.

1422
01:27:51,601 --> 01:27:52,667
Let's dance.

1423
01:27:53,904 --> 01:27:55,136
And by dance, I mean...

1424
01:27:55,138 --> 01:27:56,771
Let's try to kill each other.

1425
01:28:50,961 --> 01:28:53,361
Fine. Fists.

1426
01:28:53,363 --> 01:28:55,597
Oh, sounds like
your last Saturday night.

1427
01:30:17,180 --> 01:30:19,280
Asshole!

1428
01:31:15,505 --> 01:31:17,105
Hang in there, Baby!

1429
01:31:17,107 --> 01:31:19,173
Wade!
I gotcha!

1430
01:31:22,412 --> 01:31:24,879
I got a plan.
You're not gonna like it.

1431
01:31:35,125 --> 01:31:36,290
Shit! Shit! Shit!

1432
01:31:42,165 --> 01:31:44,832
Don't worry.
I'm totally on top of this.

1433
01:31:59,916 --> 01:32:01,949
Ah! Damn it!

1434
01:32:02,786 --> 01:32:05,787
Maximum effort!

1435
01:32:48,031 --> 01:32:49,096
Thanks.

1436
01:32:54,037 --> 01:32:55,570
Just take it slow.

1437
01:33:02,278 --> 01:33:03,845
Yoo hoo!

1438
01:33:06,082 --> 01:33:08,850
Oh, my God! That was so...

1439
01:33:39,649 --> 01:33:42,350
There are no words!

1440
01:33:42,352 --> 01:33:46,087
Me and you are headed
to fix this butterface.

1441
01:33:46,656 --> 01:33:48,022
What?

1442
01:33:50,260 --> 01:33:53,394
You stupid fucking idiot.

1443
01:33:53,396 --> 01:33:58,099
Did you really think
there was a cure... For that?

1444
01:33:59,936 --> 01:34:01,302
What?

1445
01:34:01,304 --> 01:34:02,403
You heard me.

1446
01:34:04,173 --> 01:34:05,339
No.

1447
01:34:05,341 --> 01:34:06,574
No!

1448
01:34:13,917 --> 01:34:17,518
So, you mean to say...

1449
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:22,390
After all this, you can't fix me?

1450
01:34:22,392 --> 01:34:24,525
It sounds even stupider
when you say it.

1451
01:34:24,527 --> 01:34:26,460
Like the kind of stupid who admits

1452
01:34:26,462 --> 01:34:29,630
he can't do the one thing
I'm keeping him alive for?

1453
01:34:33,503 --> 01:34:35,369
Any last words?

1454
01:34:37,206 --> 01:34:38,339
What's my name?

1455
01:34:39,375 --> 01:34:40,508
Who fucking cares?

1456
01:34:40,510 --> 01:34:41,575
Wade!

1457
01:34:43,212 --> 01:34:46,080
Four or five moments.

1458
01:34:46,082 --> 01:34:47,815
I'm sorry?

1459
01:34:47,816 --> 01:34:49,549
Four or five moments,
that's all it takes.

1460
01:34:50,186 --> 01:34:51,252
To?

1461
01:34:52,155 --> 01:34:53,487
Be a hero.

1462
01:34:55,525 --> 01:34:58,426
Everyone thinks
it's a full time job.

1463
01:34:58,428 --> 01:35:00,728
Wake up a hero,
brush your teeth a hero,

1464
01:35:00,730 --> 01:35:02,163
go to work a hero.

1465
01:35:02,498 --> 01:35:04,398
Not true.

1466
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:07,601
Over a lifetime, there are
only four or five moments

1467
01:35:07,603 --> 01:35:10,237
that really matter.

1468
01:35:10,239 --> 01:35:12,673
Moments when you're
offered a choice.

1469
01:35:12,675 --> 01:35:15,443
To make a sacrifice,
conquer a flaw,

1470
01:35:15,445 --> 01:35:17,078
save a friend...

1471
01:35:17,513 --> 01:35:20,681
Spare an enemy.

1472
01:35:20,683 --> 01:35:22,249
In these moments...

1473
01:35:23,019 --> 01:35:26,420
Everything else falls away.

1474
01:35:26,422 --> 01:35:29,423
The way the world sees us.

1475
01:35:29,425 --> 01:35:30,491
The way we...

1476
01:35:34,630 --> 01:35:35,763
Why?

1477
01:35:37,033 --> 01:35:39,100
You were droning on.

1478
01:35:39,102 --> 01:35:42,169
Sure, I may be stuck looking
like pepperoni flatbread...

1479
01:35:42,171 --> 01:35:45,206
But at least fuckface
won't heal from that.

1480
01:35:45,208 --> 01:35:48,275
If wearing superhero tights...

1481
01:35:48,277 --> 01:35:49,677
Means sparing psychopaths...

1482
01:35:49,679 --> 01:35:52,046
Then maybe I wasn't
meant to wear 'em.

1483
01:35:52,048 --> 01:35:54,382
Not everyone monitors
a hall like you.

1484
01:35:54,384 --> 01:35:55,483
Just promise...

1485
01:35:55,485 --> 01:35:57,218
Yeah, yeah, I'll be on the lookout

1486
01:35:57,220 --> 01:35:59,453
for the next four moments.

1487
01:35:59,455 --> 01:36:01,188
Oh, shit.

1488
01:36:01,190 --> 01:36:04,792
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm just a boy,

1489
01:36:04,794 --> 01:36:07,194
about to stand in front of a girl...

1490
01:36:07,196 --> 01:36:08,496
And tell her...

1491
01:36:08,498 --> 01:36:10,564
What the fuck am I gonna tell her?

1492
01:36:10,566 --> 01:36:14,035
Well, hmm,
you better figure it out.

1493
01:36:15,371 --> 01:36:16,637
I can't even tell you...

1494
01:36:16,639 --> 01:36:18,506
I deserved that.
That, too.

1495
01:36:18,508 --> 01:36:20,274
No, no, no, maybe not the nethers.

1496
01:36:20,276 --> 01:36:22,243
Start talking!

1497
01:36:24,213 --> 01:36:26,080
I'm sorry.

1498
01:36:26,082 --> 01:36:28,315
I'm so sorry.

1499
01:36:28,317 --> 01:36:30,818
For everything,
I'm sorry for leaving...

1500
01:36:32,355 --> 01:36:34,455
I'm sorry for not cowboying
up sooner.

1501
01:36:34,457 --> 01:36:36,290
It's been rough couple of years.

1502
01:36:36,292 --> 01:36:37,358
Rough?

1503
01:36:45,134 --> 01:36:47,068
I live in a crackhouse.

1504
01:36:48,204 --> 01:36:49,537
With a family of 12.

1505
01:36:51,274 --> 01:36:52,740
Every night we spoon for warmth.

1506
01:36:52,742 --> 01:36:55,810
Everybody fights for Noelle.
She's the fattest.

1507
01:36:55,812 --> 01:36:57,578
There's nothing that we don't share.

1508
01:36:57,580 --> 01:37:01,782
Floor space, dental floss,
even condoms.

1509
01:37:09,792 --> 01:37:12,193
So, you live in a house.

1510
01:37:20,803 --> 01:37:23,838
I should have come
and found you sooner.

1511
01:37:25,341 --> 01:37:26,674
But, Baby,
the guy under this mask,

1512
01:37:26,676 --> 01:37:29,376
he ain't the same one
that you remember.

1513
01:37:33,616 --> 01:37:34,849
You mean this mask?

1514
01:37:54,904 --> 01:37:56,637
And this one.

1515
01:37:58,141 --> 01:37:59,840
In case the other fell off.

1516
01:38:02,745 --> 01:38:05,212
All right.
Yeah, just... Ow.

1517
01:38:05,214 --> 01:38:06,814
Like a Band-Aid, just give it a...

1518
01:38:06,816 --> 01:38:09,150
Owdie 5,000.

1519
01:38:09,152 --> 01:38:10,284
Wait, wait, wait...

1520
01:38:12,155 --> 01:38:13,420
Are you sure?

1521
01:38:15,258 --> 01:38:16,323
I'm sure.

1522
01:38:26,536 --> 01:38:27,601
Wow.

1523
01:38:28,838 --> 01:38:30,204
Yeah.

1524
01:38:36,879 --> 01:38:38,412
Hey.

1525
01:38:40,550 --> 01:38:42,783
After a brief adjustment period...

1526
01:38:42,785 --> 01:38:44,785
And a bunch of drinks...

1527
01:38:46,255 --> 01:38:48,289
It's a face...

1528
01:38:52,595 --> 01:38:54,361
I'd be happy to sit on.

1529
01:39:01,671 --> 01:39:05,306
I'm not the same
underneath this suit, either.

1530
01:39:05,308 --> 01:39:06,740
No.

1531
01:39:06,742 --> 01:39:08,742
Super penis.

1532
01:39:08,744 --> 01:39:10,844
Come on, Wade. Language.

1533
01:39:10,846 --> 01:39:12,413
Young one is present.

1534
01:39:13,416 --> 01:39:15,349
What are you still doing?

1535
01:39:15,351 --> 01:39:17,952
Get out of here.
Go make yourself useful!

1536
01:39:17,954 --> 01:39:20,821
You, go be a really
big brother to someone.

1537
01:39:20,823 --> 01:39:22,656
Tell Beast to stop
shitting on my lawn.

1538
01:39:22,658 --> 01:39:24,625
And you, chicken noodle...

1539
01:39:24,627 --> 01:39:26,527
Nothing compares to you.

1540
01:39:26,529 --> 01:39:28,629
Sinead O'Connor, 1990.
Sorry.

1541
01:39:28,631 --> 01:39:31,465
That's all right.
You're cool.

1542
01:39:33,336 --> 01:39:34,935
What in the ass?

1543
01:39:34,937 --> 01:39:38,505
That was not mean.
I'm proud of you!

1544
01:39:38,507 --> 01:39:41,675
We will make an X-Man
of you yet, Wade.

1545
01:39:41,677 --> 01:39:42,977
For a second there,

1546
01:39:42,979 --> 01:39:44,812
it felt like we were
three mini-lion robots...

1547
01:39:44,814 --> 01:39:47,248
coming together to form
one super robot.

1548
01:39:47,883 --> 01:39:49,283
There's a stupid.

1549
01:39:49,285 --> 01:39:50,384
Yeah.

1550
01:39:53,689 --> 01:39:58,259
And now, for the moment
I've all been waiting for.

1551
01:40:01,797 --> 01:40:02,963
Come here.

1552
01:40:12,808 --> 01:40:15,843
Wham! As promised.

1553
01:40:28,824 --> 01:40:30,424
See?

1554
01:40:30,426 --> 01:40:33,694
You don't need to be
a superhero to get the girl.

1555
01:40:33,696 --> 01:40:36,997
The right girl will bring out
the hero in you.

1556
01:40:36,999 --> 01:40:40,634
Now, let's finish this
epic wide shot. Pull out.

1557
01:40:40,636 --> 01:40:42,336
There we go, that looks nice.

1558
01:40:42,338 --> 01:40:43,470
That's gonna be about the
only thing

1559
01:40:43,472 --> 01:40:44,772
that's pulling out tonight.

1560
01:40:44,774 --> 01:40:48,008
Who doesn't love
a happy ending, huh?

1561
01:40:48,010 --> 01:40:49,677
'Til next time, this is

1562
01:40:49,679 --> 01:40:51,912
your friendly neighborhood
pool guy singin'...

1563
01:40:51,914 --> 01:40:54,415
♪ I'm never gonna dance again ♪

1564
01:40:54,417 --> 01:40:57,885
♪ The way I danced with you ♪

1565
01:47:07,790 --> 01:47:09,356
You're still here?

1566
01:47:11,960 --> 01:47:15,062
It's over. Go home.

1567
01:47:16,765 --> 01:47:19,232
Oh, you're expecting
a teaser for Deadpool 2.

1568
01:47:19,234 --> 01:47:22,069
Well, we don't have that kind
of money.

1569
01:47:22,071 --> 01:47:25,105
What are you expecting?
Sam Jackson to show up?

1570
01:47:25,107 --> 01:47:27,874
With an eye patch and a saucy
little leather number?

1571
01:47:27,876 --> 01:47:29,443
Go. Go.

1572
01:47:34,783 --> 01:47:36,550
Oh.

1573
01:47:36,551 --> 01:47:38,318
But I can tell you one thing,
and it's a bit of a secret.

1574
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:41,488
For the sequel,
we're gonna have Cable.

1575
01:47:41,490 --> 01:47:44,057
Amazing character.
Bionic arm, time travel.

1576
01:47:44,059 --> 01:47:45,225
We have no idea
who we're gonna cast yet,

1577
01:47:45,227 --> 01:47:46,359
but it could be anybody.

1578
01:47:46,361 --> 01:47:47,994
Just need a big guy
with a flat top.

1579
01:47:47,996 --> 01:47:49,796
Could be Mel Gibson,
Dolph Lundgren...

1580
01:47:49,798 --> 01:47:52,232
Keira Knightley.
She's got range. Who knows.

1581
01:47:52,234 --> 01:47:53,800
Anyway, big secret. Shh...

1582
01:47:53,802 --> 01:47:55,836
Oh, and don't leave your
garbage all lying around.

1583
01:47:55,838 --> 01:47:58,238
It's a total dick move.

1584
01:47:59,141 --> 01:48:00,273
Go.
