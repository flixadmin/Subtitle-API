1
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,914
<i>Hey. Aron here. Leave a message.</i>

2
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:06,125
<i>Hey, Aron. Sonja here, again.</i>

3
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,628
<i>I know that you're probably
gonna be away this weekend.</i>

4
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:12,131
<i>But listen, just think about
what we're gonna play. Please.</i>

5
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:15,343
<i>'Cause we have to decide,
and we really need to practice, okay?</i>

6
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:17,678
<i>Anyway, it will be fun. I promise.</i>

7
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:19,472
<i>And please call Mom. Please.</i>

8
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:22,225
<i>'Cause she worries,
which you know already.</i>

9
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,561
<i>Okay. Later, A. Bye.</i>

10
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,837
Hey! It's Friday night.

11
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:17,465
April 25, 2003.

12
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:21,135
I'm just entering Canyonlands.

13
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:24,889
Just me, the music and the night.

14
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,017
Love it!

15
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,479
Blue John Canyon.

16
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:59,108
Guidebook says four and a half hours
to the big-drop rappel.

17
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:02,445
I aim to take 45 minutes off that.

18
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,067
Your face.

19
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,528
You looked like a dog.

20
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:10,114
I wish I was hiking with anyone else.

21
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:18,330
I don't know. I think we go that way.

22
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:20,291
But we went that way,
and then we had to come back.

23
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,876
Hey!

24
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,629
You're doing Blue John too, huh?

25
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:28,841
No, actually.
We're headed for the dome.

26
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,884
- But I think we're lost.
- She's lost.

27
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:32,303
Hang on.

28
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:34,931
- Oh, my God.
- God.

29
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,603
Let's see this.

30
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,522
You are... here.

31
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,357
We are?

32
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:48,068
Yeah. I knew that. I knew that.

33
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:51,489
And the dome is there.

34
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,536
I can take you that way if you like.

35
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:02,041
I'm sorry. The <i>Friday the 13th</i> there.

36
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,626
Child-killer look.

37
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,254
I'm only a psychopath on weekdays.

38
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:09,006
And today's Saturday, so...

39
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,720
Can't take this off. It's my face.

40
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:16,347
Nice.

41
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:20,059
- Aron.
- Kristi.

42
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:22,603
Allow me to introduce
you to my friend Megan.

43
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,481
- Nice to meet you.
- It's an honor.

44
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:30,236
What do you say?
You're lost. I'm a guide.

45
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,655
I'm good.

46
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,367
- Why not?
- Sure.

47
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,786
All right. This way.

48
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,413
You biked from Horseshoe, huh?

49
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:44,291
What is that-like, 20 miles?

50
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,502
Seventeen on the odometer.

51
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,005
I thought it was 17.2.

52
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,507
17.3 actually.

53
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:54,635
You're one of those.

54
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,053
I'm not one of those.

55
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,347
Do you spend a lot of time out here?

56
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,516
It's my second home.

57
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:04,353
See? There's the fork right there.

58
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,731
Okay, totally missed that.

59
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,441
- Glad we bumped into you.
- Yeah.

60
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,527
What are the odds,
considering we're all the way out here?

61
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,113
Exactly.
You go to the one place in America

62
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:16,824
you're pretty much guaranteed
not to run into a weirdo,

63
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,534
and what happens?

64
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,787
All right.

65
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:25,875
So the guidebook says
that the route's through here.

66
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:30,213
But I know a better way-the cool way.

67
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:35,968
Guaranteed best time you can have
with your clothes on.

68
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:39,013
Although it's better
with your clothes off.

69
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:43,226
- It is a bit of a climb.
- We climb.

70
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,604
- And a bit of a squeeze.
- We squeeze.

71
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,944
So you get us all the way back in here,

72
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,822
and then you tell us
that you are not a guide.

73
00:10:56,906 --> 00:11:00,701
Well, no. I'm an engineer.
But this is what I really want to do.

74
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,911
Oh, that's wonderful.

75
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,788
I've always wanted to be a supermodel,

76
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:08,122
but I don't think that's actually
really gonna work out, you know?

77
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,836
Jesus, what if these things move?

78
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,756
They've been here for millions of years.
They're not gonna move.

79
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,008
- Sure they will.
- What?

80
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,802
Yeah. Everything's moving all the time.

81
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,555
Let's just hope not today.

82
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,598
Great.

83
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:27,603
All right.

84
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:31,274
Now all you gotta remember
is that everything will be okay.

85
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:34,277
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

86
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:39,156
- What-
- Where-Aron!

87
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,993
Are you okay? Aron! Aron!

88
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,916
<i>Home on the train</i>

89
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,754
<i>Why'd you put my monkey on the train</i>

90
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,297
<i>As you arrived</i>

91
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:58,258
<i>My sleeping monkey is revived</i>

92
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:02,305
- Listen to the guy. He's fine.
- Yeah.

93
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:04,348
He's batshit.

94
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,392
You're batshit!

95
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:10,270
Come on! You gotta come down here!

96
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:12,064
Trust me!

97
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,316
Trust you? I'll kill you, Aron Ralston!

98
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,944
Oh, please. You love this.

99
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:34,294
Hey!

100
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:35,838
- Nice job!
- Oh, my God!

101
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,549
- Megan! You're missing it!
- Come on!

102
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:39,758
It's amazing!

103
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,260
- Fuck. Fuck.
- Just jump!

104
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:43,637
- Oh, my God. Fuck.
- Just jump, Megan!

105
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,389
Fuck.

106
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,308
Oh, shit!

107
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,689
Are you okay?

108
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,274
- Nice jump.
- Oh, my God.

109
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:56,958
I can't believe I just did that.

110
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,696
- That's why we have to do it again.
- Again? Again?

111
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:03,323
- Camera! Camera!
- Camera? Camera!

112
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:05,409
Camera!

113
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:25,470
So, Blue John is actually named
after this guy, Blue John

114
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:29,516
who was Butch Cassidy's cook from
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.

115
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,601
That's cool.

116
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,477
- The Hole-in-the-Wall Gang.
- Yeah.

117
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:35,689
And they would hide out
in these canyons, I guess.

118
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:39,359
But also what they'd do is they'd
run horses-wild horses-into here,

119
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,320
and they'd trap 'em
at the end of the canyons.

120
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:43,280
- Wow.
- That's how they'd catch the horses.

121
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,323
Wow.

122
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,325
You wanna take
one more picture before I go?

123
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:47,701
- Yeah.
- Okay, cool.

124
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,120
Ready?

125
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:52,789
One, two, three.

126
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:55,000
Blue John. Blue Cheese.

127
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,044
Well, will I ever see you again?

128
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:59,130
That depends. Do you party?

129
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:02,674
Do I party? Yeah, sometimes.

130
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:06,053
Tomorrow night, we're actually seriously
throwing a party, if you wanna come.

131
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:08,305
Yeah. You should come by,
have a beer, kick back.

132
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,973
Okay. Where am I going?

133
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:12,017
It's about 20 miles away near Green River.

134
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,102
You know the old motel? It's behind that.

135
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,647
There's gonna be a huge
inflatable Scooby-Doo.

136
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:18,231
- You can't miss it.
- Really? Okay.

137
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:19,316
- Yep.
- Cool.

138
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,359
Okay.

139
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,736
It was good to meet you. See ya!

140
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,989
Bye! Scooby-Doo!

141
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:27,032
Yeah!

142
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,617
Rock on!

143
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,271
You think he's actually gonna show up?

144
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,793
I don't think we
figured in his day at all.

145
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,797
You liked him.

146
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,523
Shit!

147
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,691
This is insane!

148
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,669
Fuck.

149
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,718
Move this fucking rock!

150
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:09,647
Please.

151
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,241
Fuck.

152
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:50,855
Fucking save it.

153
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:51,772
Oh, God.

154
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:13,337
Kristi!

155
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,631
Megan!

156
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:18,216
Kristi!

157
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,802
It's Aron!

158
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,013
Megan!

159
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:26,725
Kristi! Megan!

160
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,895
Kristi!

161
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:50,332
Think.

162
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:54,336
Just think.

163
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,232
Ow!

164
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,648
Yeah.

165
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,578
Fuck.

166
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:11,306
Fuck.

167
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,141
Shit.

168
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,977
Oh, God.

169
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,187
Shit!

170
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,148
Fucker.

171
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:13,035
Come on. Please.

172
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,188
Sweet.

173
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,582
Nice and dull.

174
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,891
Look at the size of this one, man.

175
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,977
Like, how the fuck did this get here?

176
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:20,991
Yes.

177
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:32,460
Okay.

178
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:16,398
Hey!

179
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,642
Hey, buddy.

180
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,895
Here we go.

181
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,527
It's 3:05

182
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:32,033
on Sunday, April 27, 2003.

183
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:36,620
This marks 24 hours

184
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:40,875
of being stuck in Blue John Canyon

185
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:45,547
right where it slots
up before the big drop.

186
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,717
My name's Aron Ralston.

187
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:54,055
My parents are Donna and Larry Ralston
of Englewood, Colorado.

188
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:00,103
Whoever finds this can keep the recorder.

189
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:04,440
Just please try
and get in touch with my parents,

190
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:07,359
and give them this tape.

191
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:09,028
I'd appreciate it.

192
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:15,326
I was descending Blue John yesterday

193
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:22,208
when this chock stone came loose,

194
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:23,834
and rolled onto my arm.

195
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:26,754
And now it's stuck.

196
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:32,635
The thumb is kind of this gray-blue color.

197
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:35,012
Yeah.

198
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:38,641
It's been without
circulation for 24 hours.

199
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:42,937
So, I think it's pretty well gone.

200
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:47,108
I'm low on food.

201
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:53,448
That's about 300, 400 mil,

202
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,618
and that's it for water.

203
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:04,584
I'm in pretty deep doo-doo here.

204
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,923
Hello!

205
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:12,174
Please!

206
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:14,344
There's someone down here!

207
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:16,554
Help!

208
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:18,640
I'm in the canyon!

209
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:20,683
Help!

210
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:21,600
Help!

211
00:34:57,845 --> 00:34:59,388
<i>Please!</i>

212
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:00,807
<i>Help!</i>

213
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:03,810
<i>Help!</i>

214
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:07,062
<i>Down here!</i>

215
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:08,523
<i>Help!</i>

216
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,997
Don't lose it.

217
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:31,546
Aron.

218
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,884
Do not lose it.

219
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:30,313
Not bad.

220
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,283
Oh, dinner.

221
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:55,045
<i>Tomorrow night, we're actually seriously
throwing a party, if you want to come.</i>

222
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:57,089
<i>You should come by,
have a beer, kick back.</i>

223
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:59,801
<i>There's gonna be
a huge inflatable Scooby-Doo.</i>

224
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:02,762
Scooby-Doo.

225
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:13,481
<i>Where are you</i>

226
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:26,661
Mountain Dew.

227
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:31,124
Plastic cup.

228
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:34,836
Thank you.

229
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:39,674
Might take a beer as well.

230
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,302
<i>Don't mind if I do.</i>

231
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,909
<i>Hey. Aron here. Leave a message.</i>

232
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:55,791
<i>Aron, it's Mom. I was hoping to catch you.</i>

233
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:58,752
<i>Are you there?</i>

234
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,588
<i>Hello?</i>

235
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:04,050
<i>Okay. Nothing urgent.</i>

236
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:08,471
<i>Dad's in New York,
so it'll be a quiet weekend.</i>

237
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:13,100
<i>Call me, okay? Lots of love.</i>

238
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:34,247
- Where you going?
- Don't know yet.

239
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:36,331
Right there, Brion.

240
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:39,252
Maybe Utah. Maybe somewhere else.

241
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:41,879
- Have a good one.
- Always do.

242
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:43,798
<i>Always do.</i>

243
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:12,243
Let's go.

244
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:54,660
Oh, come on!

245
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:29,338
Crap.

246
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:44,854
This is freaking me out,
looking at myself.

247
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:47,982
Sorry. I hope that's okay.

248
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:54,280
It's Monday.

249
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,451
Bummer, all day.

250
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:02,162
I tried to set up this
pulley all morning,

251
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,831
but it didn't work.

252
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,792
It was worth a try.

253
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:08,627
But there's too much friction.

254
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:12,965
And it's a climbing rope,
so there's too much stretch.

255
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:16,885
What I could really use
is about 20 meters

256
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:20,765
of static wrap rope, 9.8 mil.

257
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:26,520
Three or four pulleys,
a rack of carabiners, a sling

258
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:30,024
power drill... and bolt kit.

259
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:36,405
And eight burly men to do all the hauling.

260
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:40,868
That should just about do it.

261
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:45,873
I have...

262
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,753
about 150 milliliters of water left...

263
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:57,051
which should keep me alive
till tomorrow night

264
00:43:58,511 --> 00:44:00,137
if I'm lucky.

265
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:01,972
I peed twice.

266
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,435
Almost pissed my pants.

267
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:10,887
I don't know,
my body's acting really weird.

268
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:15,945
<i>The second time, I did it in the CamelBak.</i>

269
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:21,992
<i>Smells really bad.</i>

270
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:25,246
But I'm sure it'll settle.

271
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:31,210
It's got to be chilled
like sauvignon blanc.

272
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:37,466
No number twos.

273
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:40,343
Which should disappoint my insect friends.

274
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:42,888
They'll just have to wait.

275
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:45,766
Let's see, what else could I tell you?

276
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:52,481
<i>There's this raven that
comes every morning.</i>

277
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:57,652
Hey.

278
00:44:57,736 --> 00:45:00,281
<i>I clocked it at 8.- 17.</i>

279
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:05,243
<i>I'll film it for you tomorrow.</i>

280
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:09,081
Every morning at 9:30...

281
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:13,627
<i>I get 15 minutes of sunlight.</i>

282
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,254
<i>It's really nice.</i>

283
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,260
I have been chipping away.

284
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:26,140
<i>More to keep warm than anything.</i>

285
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:32,687
I'm beginning to think
that my hand is supporting the rock.

286
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:34,856
So when I chip away a little bit

287
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:37,026
it actually settles more.

288
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:42,448
So...

289
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:47,119
I found this great tourniquet.

290
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:23,697
Oh, yeah. That hurts.

291
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:11,954
It hasn't been very useful.

292
00:47:16,125 --> 00:47:17,459
Lesson:

293
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:22,715
Don't buy the
cheap, made-in-China multi-tool.

294
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:26,259
I tried to find my Swiss Army knife, but

295
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:29,220
This thing came free with a flashlight.

296
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:32,307
The flashlight was a piece of shit too.

297
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:34,935
I kept it in my truck for emergencies.

298
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:38,605
Not that I'm blaming you, Mom.

299
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:44,319
It was a perfectly great stocking stuffer.

300
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:49,908
And there's no way
you could have ever known

301
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:51,842
that I'd get in this kind of trouble.

302
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:55,497
<i>When we watch this later,
will the camera have to be on?</i>

303
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:58,208
<i>Yeah. So you have to
leave the camera with us</i>

304
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:00,585
<i>if we want to watch something
that you've made, right?</i>

305
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:02,379
<i>- Yeah.
- Good job, honey.</i>

306
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:05,882
<i>- Isn't that great?
- That is quite extraordinary.</i>

307
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:08,885
- So he's filming her now.
- Sounds beautiful, sweetheart.

308
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:11,513
- Yes.
- We're seeing it now live,

309
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:14,433
but he's going to be able
to show this again.

310
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:18,729
Go away.

311
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:24,109
To be able to watch it.
We can't just watch it with a

312
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:27,529
So good.

313
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:31,241
<i>Well done. Okay.</i>

314
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:37,289
Way to go, Sis.

315
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:40,542
<i>- Keep playing?
- Yes, honey. Keep going.</i>

316
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,428
Fuck.

317
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:05,376
Okay!

318
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:06,628
Go!

319
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:30,110
I love you.

320
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:10,108
So...

321
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:14,112
how do I get in?

322
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:18,951
<i>What's the...</i>

323
00:51:23,956 --> 00:51:25,248
<i>- You know?
- Combination.</i>

324
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:26,541
<i>Combination.</i>

325
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:30,671
If I told you...

326
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,342
I'd have to kill you.

327
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:38,428
But already you kill me.

328
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,402
Combination?

329
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:57,489
I think I have it.

330
00:52:10,711 --> 00:52:12,212
Fuck!

331
00:52:20,595 --> 00:52:22,097
Fuck.

332
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:01,094
Fuck. Fuck.

333
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:58,003
Who's there?

334
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:07,846
Aron?

335
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:42,588
Please!

336
00:55:43,507 --> 00:55:45,634
Please!

337
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:59,022
Please!

338
00:56:09,115 --> 00:56:11,200
<i>Good morning, everybody out there.</i>

339
00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:12,410
<i>Good morning.</i>

340
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:14,203
<i>It's</i> The Morning Show
<i>with Brian Stephenson</i>

341
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:15,872
<i>Also coming up this half hour</i>

342
00:56:15,956 --> 00:56:19,006
<i>Good morning. This will get
you going today. 90 for your high</i>

343
00:56:20,669 --> 00:56:22,712
Good morning, everyone!

344
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:28,092
It is 7:00 here in Canyonlands, USA.

345
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:30,887
And this morning on the boulder

346
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:33,598
we have a very special guest

347
00:56:33,682 --> 00:56:38,269
self-proclaimed American superhero...

348
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:40,771
Aron Ralston!

349
00:56:40,855 --> 00:56:42,857
Let's hear it for Aron!

350
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:45,735
Hey.

351
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:47,778
Hi. Oh, gosh.

352
00:56:47,862 --> 00:56:51,199
It's a real pleasure to be here.
Thank you. Thank you.

353
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:55,369
Hey, can I say hi to my mom and dad?

354
00:56:55,453 --> 00:56:57,580
Mom and Dad!

355
00:56:57,664 --> 00:56:59,874
Mustn't forget Mom and Dad. Right, Aron?

356
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:02,001
Yeah. That's right.

357
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:04,045
Hey, Mom.

358
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:05,922
I'm really sorry...

359
00:57:06,006 --> 00:57:08,716
I didn't answer the phone the other night.

360
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,803
If I had, I would have told you
where I was going, and then

361
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:15,431
Well,
I probably wouldn't be here right now.

362
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:17,266
That's for sure!

363
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:20,019
But like I always say

364
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:22,855
your supreme selfishness

365
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:24,941
is our gain.

366
00:57:25,025 --> 00:57:28,486
Thank you, Aron.
Anyone else you'd like to say hi to?

367
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:31,155
- Well, Brion at work.
- Hi, Aron!

368
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:32,782
Hey.

369
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:35,116
I probably won't be making it
into work today.

370
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:39,831
Get a load of this guy! Oh, wait. Hold on.

371
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:45,711
We've got a question coming in
from another Aron

372
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:49,215
in Loser Canyon, Utah.

373
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:50,758
Aron asks...

374
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:53,052
Am I right in thinking

375
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:56,264
that even if Brion from work

376
00:57:56,348 --> 00:57:57,932
notifies the police

377
00:57:58,016 --> 00:58:00,268
they'll put a 24-hour hold on it

378
00:58:00,352 --> 00:58:03,604
before they file a Missing Persons report?

379
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:07,817
Which means you won't become
officially missing

380
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:12,030
until midday Wednesday, at the earliest!

381
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:15,324
Yeah.
You're right on the money there, Aron.

382
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:20,288
Which means I'll probably be dead by then.

383
00:58:20,372 --> 00:58:24,041
Aron from Loser Canyon, Utah.
How do you know so much?

384
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:26,711
Well, I'll tell you how I know so much.

385
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:30,965
I volunteer for the rescue service.

386
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:33,259
You see, I'm something of a

387
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:37,305
well, a big fucking hard hero.

388
00:58:37,972 --> 00:58:42,226
And I can do everything on my own,
you see?

389
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:44,895
I do see.

390
00:58:44,979 --> 00:58:47,148
Now

391
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:50,610
is it true that despite,

392
00:58:51,695 --> 00:58:56,198
or maybe because
you're a big fucking hard hero

393
00:58:56,282 --> 00:58:59,619
you didn't tell anyone
where you were going?

394
00:59:02,163 --> 00:59:03,832
Yeah, that's absolutely correct.

395
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:09,963
- Anyone?
- Anyone.

396
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:14,926
Oops!

397
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:21,224
Oops.

398
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:31,192
Oops.

399
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:42,662
Mom, Dad.

400
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:48,084
I just want to take this time to tell you

401
00:59:48,168 --> 00:59:51,838
that the times we've spent together
have been awesome.

402
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,133
And I haven't appreciated you in my heart

403
00:59:56,217 --> 00:59:58,219
as I know that I could.

404
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:03,307
Mom, I love you,

405
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:06,978
and I wish that I'd returned
all your calls, ever.

406
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:13,902
I love you guys,

407
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:17,906
and I'll always be with you.

408
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:25,205
Yeah.

409
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:01,634
Bone.

410
01:03:12,664 --> 01:03:14,582
It's no Slurpee.

411
01:03:18,002 --> 01:03:19,545
It's like a bag of piss.

412
01:03:36,562 --> 01:03:38,064
<i>Nice!</i>

413
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:55,831
<i>Come on, Ralston!</i>

414
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:58,375
<i>Okay, I'm gonna go up again.</i>

415
01:03:58,459 --> 01:04:00,377
<i>Give me that.</i>

416
01:04:00,461 --> 01:04:02,630
<i>Quick, while he's gone.</i>

417
01:04:02,714 --> 01:04:04,506
<i>- Listen.
- We could tell him.</i>

418
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:06,342
<i>- I know that.
- Okay? Tell him.</i>

419
01:04:06,426 --> 01:04:08,844
<i>We're very worried about you.</i>

420
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:10,888
<i>- We're worried.
- About your music.</i>

421
01:04:10,972 --> 01:04:12,848
<i>Your musical choices are really rough.</i>

422
01:04:12,932 --> 01:04:15,601
<i>If you keep singing Phish,
you're never gonna get a girlfriend.</i>

423
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:17,770
<i>- Never.
- You might have one, but I doubt that you do.</i>

424
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:21,190
<i>- You may be sort of cute, occasionally.
- I'm nervous and scared for you.</i>

425
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:24,151
<i>- Okay. This cannonball's for you.
- No one will care.</i>

426
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:25,945
<i>Okay.</i>

427
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:30,824
<i>That was a 10.</i>

428
01:04:30,908 --> 01:04:32,410
<i>All right.</i>

429
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:37,164
<i>I'm going to test your theory</i>

430
01:04:37,248 --> 01:04:39,584
<i>about whether or not it's better to do it</i>

431
01:04:41,294 --> 01:04:43,094
<i>- Oh, God!
- Without your clothes on.</i>

432
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:46,632
<i>I'm just gonna swim for a bit.</i>

433
01:05:08,696 --> 01:05:11,031
Don't.

434
01:05:11,115 --> 01:05:13,215
No, no. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.

435
01:05:14,035 --> 01:05:15,203
Please.

436
01:05:17,121 --> 01:05:18,623
Don't.

437
01:05:20,208 --> 01:05:21,583
Don't.

438
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:23,836
<i>Ralston, rock on.</i>

439
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:18,724
Oh, fuck.

440
01:07:19,243 --> 01:07:21,287
<i>You don't even want me here, do you?</i>

441
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:26,292
I'm gonna go, Aron.

442
01:07:29,212 --> 01:07:31,214
<i>Is that what you want?</i>

443
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:36,135
It is, isn't it?

444
01:07:40,431 --> 01:07:41,599
Okay.

445
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:45,561
<i>Come back.</i>

446
01:07:49,649 --> 01:07:52,151
You're gonna be so lonely, Aron.

447
01:08:08,376 --> 01:08:13,714
<i>46, 47, 48, 49, 50!</i>

448
01:08:13,798 --> 01:08:16,217
<i>You hear that, Aron? I'm coming!</i>

449
01:08:18,844 --> 01:08:21,180
I'm holding on.

450
01:08:23,724 --> 01:08:25,851
Time's moving really slowly.

451
01:08:27,395 --> 01:08:29,855
My heart's beating really fast.

452
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:32,357
I swear to God, it feels like

453
01:08:32,441 --> 01:08:33,442
It feels like

454
01:08:33,526 --> 01:08:36,276
It's beating, like, three times
as fast as it should be.

455
01:08:42,159 --> 01:08:43,661
So cold.

456
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:46,372
So cold.

457
01:08:50,459 --> 01:08:52,002
Hey.

458
01:08:52,086 --> 01:08:53,546
Blue John.

459
01:08:58,551 --> 01:09:03,013
I... love... you.

460
01:09:03,097 --> 01:09:04,765
There you are.

461
01:09:05,891 --> 01:09:09,186
Rana. I've been thinking about you, girl.

462
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:11,146
<i>I've been thinking about you, girl.</i>

463
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:12,898
<i>I admit it. I admit it.</i>

464
01:09:17,111 --> 01:09:19,655
<i>- I know how I am.
- I tried to do everything.</i>

465
01:09:19,739 --> 01:09:21,907
<i>- Where I was.
- I tried.</i>

466
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:23,700
<i>Aron? Where are you?</i>

467
01:09:23,784 --> 01:09:25,745
<i>Where are you?</i>

468
01:09:38,049 --> 01:09:40,051
What are you guys doing here?

469
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:43,137
Eddie? Tom?

470
01:09:43,888 --> 01:09:45,931
Hey, you guys. What's going on?

471
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:49,602
Eric? Hey.

472
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:54,357
You look like the Hole-in-the-Wall Gang.

473
01:09:57,568 --> 01:09:58,944
Dorks.

474
01:10:01,989 --> 01:10:03,991
Found you, Aron.

475
01:10:11,415 --> 01:10:15,043
<i>Sis,
I'm sorry that I won't be at your wedding.</i>

476
01:10:15,127 --> 01:10:18,798
<i>I know that I promised to play,
that we'd play.</i>

477
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:21,466
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

478
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:24,136
I know it'll be a good one.

479
01:10:25,805 --> 01:10:28,598
8:15. There's no raven.

480
01:10:28,682 --> 01:10:31,018
8:20.

481
01:10:31,102 --> 01:10:32,937
8:30. My raven didn't come.

482
01:10:37,817 --> 01:10:40,068
I've been thinking.

483
01:10:40,152 --> 01:10:42,321
Everything is

484
01:10:43,656 --> 01:10:46,408
- It just comes together.
- You're gonna be so lonely, Aron.

485
01:10:46,492 --> 01:10:48,660
- Have a good one.
- Always do.

486
01:10:48,744 --> 01:10:49,953
Laters!

487
01:10:50,037 --> 01:10:52,873
- It's me.
<i>- Aron, it's Mom.</i>

488
01:10:52,957 --> 01:10:55,292
<i>- I was hoping to catch you.</i>
- I chose this.

489
01:10:55,376 --> 01:10:57,627
<i>Dad's in New York,
so it'll be a quiet weekend.</i>

490
01:10:57,711 --> 01:10:58,920
I chose all of this.

491
01:10:59,004 --> 01:11:02,299
Call me, okay? Lots of love.

492
01:11:05,010 --> 01:11:06,178
This rock.

493
01:11:07,805 --> 01:11:10,265
This rock has been waiting for me
my entire life.

494
01:11:10,349 --> 01:11:14,353
I hate this rock!

495
01:11:15,604 --> 01:11:17,481
- In its entire life-
- ever since it was

496
01:11:17,565 --> 01:11:19,941
a bit of meteorite

497
01:11:20,025 --> 01:11:21,651
a million billion years ago

498
01:11:21,735 --> 01:11:23,403
How the fuck did this get here?

499
01:11:23,487 --> 01:11:24,946
Up there in space

500
01:11:25,030 --> 01:11:26,866
it's been waiting

501
01:11:27,867 --> 01:11:30,285
to come here

502
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:32,580
right-right here.

503
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:38,085
I've been moving towards it my whole life.

504
01:11:38,169 --> 01:11:41,797
<i>The minute I was born,
every breath I've taken</i>

505
01:11:41,881 --> 01:11:43,256
<i>every action</i>

506
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:46,468
<i>has been leading me to this crack</i>

507
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:48,721
<i>on the earth's surface.</i>

508
01:16:03,183 --> 01:16:05,269
Okay. Come on.

509
01:16:40,387 --> 01:16:42,055
Don't pass out.

510
01:18:03,554 --> 01:18:04,721
Don't fall asleep.

511
01:19:42,861 --> 01:19:44,363
Thank you.

512
01:21:53,158 --> 01:21:54,826
Easy.

513
01:22:00,415 --> 01:22:02,918
Easy. Come on.

514
01:25:27,998 --> 01:25:29,165
Help!

515
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:34,629
Please!

516
01:25:35,755 --> 01:25:37,674
Help me!

517
01:25:42,929 --> 01:25:44,556
I need help!

518
01:25:57,068 --> 01:26:00,321
My name is Aron Ral... Aron Ralston.

519
01:26:00,405 --> 01:26:02,573
This Saturday I was trapped by a boulder.

520
01:26:02,657 --> 01:26:05,701
I haven't had food or water for five days.

521
01:26:05,785 --> 01:26:07,286
<i>This morning I cut my arm</i>

522
01:26:07,370 --> 01:26:09,080
This morning I cut my arm off.

523
01:26:12,250 --> 01:26:14,252
Please. Some water?

524
01:26:16,838 --> 01:26:18,506
Thank you.

525
01:26:26,973 --> 01:26:30,601
- Do you have a phone?
- Yes, but no signal.

526
01:26:30,685 --> 01:26:33,479
You should stop and rest.

527
01:26:33,563 --> 01:26:35,732
No. I've gotta keep going.

528
01:26:36,983 --> 01:26:38,859
Can one of you run?

529
01:26:38,943 --> 01:26:41,279
Can one of you run ahead?
