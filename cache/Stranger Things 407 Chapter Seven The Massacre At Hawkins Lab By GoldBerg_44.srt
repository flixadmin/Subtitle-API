00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,330
that monster in there,

307
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:56,420
it's a part of something
that wants to hurt El. To kill her.

308
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,130
I don't understand.

309
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,550
To be honest, neither do I.

310
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:03,970
All I know is that thing...

311
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:06,640
that thing shouldn't be here.
It shouldn't be alive.

312
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:10,560
Because it is,
it means it still isn't over.

313
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,020
I thought I was put here

314
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,530
to pay for what I've done.

315
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:21,860
But I might've been put here
for some other reason.

316
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:23,570
Maybe I...

317
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,740
maybe I can still help El.

318

319

You almost sound religious, American.

320

Religious? I don't know about that.

321
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,720
But maybe I should
give that prayer thing a try.

- Scale of one to ten.
- A hundred.

A hundred?

502
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,910
The serial killer is a dark wizard
from the Upside Down.

503
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,410
And we've been looking for him,

504
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,500
but he's in the Upside Down,
which we can't reach.

505
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,210
At least we thought we couldn't,

506
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:44,550
until we found a gate at Lover's Lake.

507
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:48,090
That was the reason why we were there,
but these stupid cops grabbed us.

The smothering in my sleep part,
but not much else.

524
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,710
Why would they open up a gate
at Lover's Lake?

525
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,920
- What?
- The commies.

526
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:31,930
- The commies didn't.
- Then who did?

527
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:34,350
- Nobody.
- So it just opened up for fun?

528
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:36,890
Erica, you have no idea
what you're talking about.

529

No, she doesn't,
yet she raises an essential question.

530
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,610
How did Watergate open up?

531
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:46,020
Only two gates have opened,
so far as we know.

532
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,940
One by El, one by the commies.

533
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:50,400
But it's not the commies
or El this time, so it...

<font color="#ff00ff">[EERIE MUSIC PLAYING]</font>

00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:03,210
There's one thing we've never understood.

539
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:06,460
Which is why Vecna's killing people.

540
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:08,170
What's his motive?

541
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,590
Killing teens?
It always just seemed too random.

542
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,300
Too prosaic.

543
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:17,680
On top of that, how does
the Mind Flayer figure into all this?

544
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:20,020
Maybe this is it.

545
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,020
This is the answer.

546
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,730
What is the answer?

547
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:25,360
You sure you just want water?

548
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,320
- We have Coke, Sprite, Dr. Pepper.
- Coke works. Thank you.

Okay, just hear me out.

550
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:34,740
How did El open the Mothergate?

551
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,030
She contacted the Demogorgon.

552
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,410
With psychic contact. Just like...

553
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,540
- Vecna when he casts his spells.
- Exactly.

554
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,620
So, what if, with each kill,

555
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:46,580
he's not simply killing them,

556
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:49,590
he's making a powerful
psychic connection with his victims?

557
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:51,170
A connection powerful enough

558
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:54,380
to rip a hole in the fabric
of time and space.

559
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:55,800
He's opening more gates.

560
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:56,890
Bingo.

561
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:59,560

<font color="#ff00ff">[POLICE RADIO CHATTER]</font>

563
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:04,560
- Why would he be opening gates?
- To take over the world.

564
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,560
Who do we know
that wants to take over the world?

565
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,520
The Mind Flayer.

566
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:10,320
So if the Demogorgon
was just his foot soldier,

567
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,610
Vecna's his five-star general.

568
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:16,530
A five-star general
with the power to open gates.

569
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,030
- Holy shit.
- Holy shit.
