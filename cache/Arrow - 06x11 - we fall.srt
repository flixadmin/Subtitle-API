1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,615
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:02,792 --> 00:00:04,191
After 5 years in Hell,

3
00:00:04,193 --> 00:00:06,295
I returned home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:07,872
to save my city.

5
00:00:07,874 --> 00:00:10,175
Today, I fight that war
on two fronts.

6
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:12,544
By day, I lead Star City
as its mayor,

7
00:00:12,546 --> 00:00:14,546
but by night,
I am someone else.

8
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:17,148
I am...Something else.

9
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,517
I am the Green Arrow.

10
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,319
Previously on "Arrow"...

11
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:25,824
You cost me
something dear to me--my son.

12
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:27,425
We decided to go
our own way.

13
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:28,927
Good luck.

14
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:30,195
It's our new lair.

15
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:32,197
Helix used to
operate out of here,

16
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:34,032
but it's not like they're
using it anymore.

17
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,533
So we've got them
fighting with each other

18
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,402
instead of fighting us.

19
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:39,137
Vincent's working
with them, too.

20
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:41,206
Oliver saw him
with James and the rest.

21
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:42,173
You don't understand.

22
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:44,009
You lying
son of a bitch.

23
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:45,777
You were the Green Arrow
for my dad.

24
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:47,245
That's right, William.

25
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:49,014
I'm sorry you
had to step in,

26
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:50,415
and I'm sorry you had
to lie to your son.

27
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:51,850
I don't want to lie
to him,

28
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:53,551
but I can do it
if it's temporary.

29
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:57,722
I may have solved
the glitch in my chip.

30
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:00,225
It worked?

31
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:02,761
Looks like we're not
as undermanned as we thought.

32
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:04,229
Yes! Ha!

33
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:17,742
I'm a city councilman!

34
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,811
I deserve some respect!

35
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:47,138
Hey. Didn't your shift
end at 6:00, Doc?

36
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,407
That's what I keep
asking myself, Gilbert.

37
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:57,449
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

38
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:04,389
Joe and I are
gonna watch the game tonight

39
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:06,124
if you want to
join us, Frank.

40
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,926
I wish I could.

41
00:02:07,928 --> 00:02:09,761
Today's gonna be
a long one.

42
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:36,688
Aah!

43
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:49,601
Aah!

44
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:59,744
All right, everybody.
Stay calm.

45
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,515
Oh. What was that?
What's happening?

46
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,116
Back away
from the walls.

47
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:06,684
Everyone, back
away from the walls.

48
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,353
No, no. We got
to get out of here.

49
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:09,921
No, no, no, don't!

50
00:03:11,304 --> 00:03:15,304

00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:29,240
Indeed it was,
young man.

54
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:31,743
- Try again, please.
- Ok.

55
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:36,214
Yes! Ha!

56
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:43,087
These things are--
you win...Again.

57
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:44,556
Well, you must be
out of practice

58
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,825
since you quit being
the Green Arrow.

59
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:48,560
That must be it,
yeah.

60
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,161
You all ready
for your field trip, yeah?

61
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:51,763
- Yeah.
- Ok.

62
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:53,364
It's the Coastal
Biology Center, right?

63
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:56,000
Yeah. There's a prep sheet
for the trip,

64
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:58,303
and I tried one
of the extra credits.

65
00:03:58,305 --> 00:03:59,537
Hold on.

66
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,372
Will you take
a look at it?

67
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:02,607
Yeah, of course.

68
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,709
I meant Felicity.

69
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,678
Sure you did.
Yep.

70
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,146
I'm sorry.

71
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:10,014
It's a math problem about
hyperbolic geometry

72
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:11,783
in marine organisms
like coral.

73
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:13,318
I do know what coral is,
but that's ok.

74
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,086
This is
a high-dimensional math problem

75
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,120
most people don't get
until they're

76
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:19,257
in 12th grade AP,

77
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,458
and it's perfect.

78
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,693
Well,
congratulations.

79
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:23,428
Take your flash
backpack

80
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,963
and don't miss your
bus, all right?

81
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:26,798
- Ok.
- That's fine. Get out of here.

82
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,868
Go learn something.

83
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,704
- I know what coral is.
- Mm-hmm.

84
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:34,572
- Good morning.
- Morning.

85
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:37,809
Heh heh.

86
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:39,444
I think we've reached
maximum-level domesticity.

87
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:40,745
Oh, God. I certainly
hope not.

88
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:48,319
- What's up?
- Councilman Grovner is dead.

89
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:50,321
- What?
- So are 6 people in the hospital

90
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:52,624
and 5 more electrocuted
by an elevator.

91
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,459
- In an elevator?
- By an elevator.

92
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,427
What? That doesn't
make any sense.

93
00:04:57,831 --> 00:04:59,097
Yeah. Quentin.

94
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:00,632
We got
a problem. An elevator--

95
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,433
Electrocuted 5 people.

96
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:03,501
Yeah. How do you know?

97
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:05,069
I just know.
Look. Grab Thea,

98
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:06,838
and I will meet you
at the SCPD, ok?

99
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,607
Oliver, one
of the casualties,

100
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:11,476
it's Frank Pike.

101
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,346
Oh.

102
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:17,415
Ahem.

103
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,317
I will see you
soon.

104
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,790
Frank Pike is dead.

105
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:27,492
Can you get your stuff,
can you go to the bunker?

106
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:28,993
Can you find out what's
going on, please?

107
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,662
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

108
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:42,373
Hey. That chip's
really working.

109
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,709
- Yeah. I never felt better.
- That's great.

110
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,844
Or stronger.

111
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,147
- Everything all right?
- No. Not even close.

112
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:50,982
The city is under some
sort of electronic attack.

113
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:52,884
- Cayden James?
- You got to figure.

114
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:54,452
I mean, cars, cranes,
life support systems,

115
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,287
even elevators are
killing people all over town.

116
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:57,956
Yeah. Hacking electronics
I always thought

117
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,457
was a bit of a bank shot
when you have

118
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:00,892
a thermobaric bomb
and amplifier.

119
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:02,627
- And control of the port.
- Right.

120
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:03,842
It's Oliver.

121
00:06:03,843 --> 00:06:05,109
Hey. I'm on with John.

122
00:06:05,111 --> 00:06:06,578
What do we know?

123
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,879
"Hack-cidents" are happening
all over the city.

124
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:09,214
Size of this attack,

125
00:06:09,216 --> 00:06:10,215
you got to think
it's Cayden James,

126
00:06:10,217 --> 00:06:11,583
but to what end?

127
00:06:11,585 --> 00:06:12,918
Well, should I get
William home,

128
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:14,619
or should I be happy that he's
heading out of the city?

129
00:06:14,621 --> 00:06:16,387
Oh, for sure
the second one.

130
00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:18,056
Let's think about looping in Dinah,
Curtis, and Rene.

131
00:06:18,058 --> 00:06:19,657
We may have gone
our separate ways,

132
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:21,359
but we have
the same goals.

133
00:06:22,262 --> 00:06:25,330
Do it. We need all
the help we can get.

134
00:06:25,332 --> 00:06:27,165
Mr. Mayor.

135
00:06:27,167 --> 00:06:32,103
Quentin, I'm--I'm
sorry about Frank.

136
00:06:32,105 --> 00:06:33,938
He was a good cop,
and he was a better man.

137
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,975
Yeah, yeah.
He sure was,

138
00:06:36,977 --> 00:06:39,544
but he wouldn't want us
standing around here grieving, right?

139
00:06:39,546 --> 00:06:41,212
Listen. 911 is
on overload,

140
00:06:41,214 --> 00:06:42,580
and now we got no one
here to run the show.

141
00:06:42,582 --> 00:06:45,250
Yes, we do.

142
00:06:46,553 --> 00:06:48,053
Just when I thought
I was out.

143
00:06:48,055 --> 00:06:49,821
Can you catch me up
on the status here?

144
00:06:49,823 --> 00:06:51,956
Yeah. Well, the, uh,
status keeps changing,

145
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:54,092
but I can tell you
what we know so far.

146
00:06:55,595 --> 00:06:58,329
Ahh. Not bad for one
week's worth of work.

147
00:06:58,331 --> 00:07:00,565
I would rather have
a team I can trust

148
00:07:00,567 --> 00:07:02,267
than any kind
of technology.

149
00:07:02,269 --> 00:07:03,401
Word.

150
00:07:07,774 --> 00:07:10,141
It's Felicity.

151
00:07:10,143 --> 00:07:12,310
She isn't bugging us
again, is she?

152
00:07:12,312 --> 00:07:14,646
No.

153
00:07:14,648 --> 00:07:16,614
I'll do a sweep.

154
00:07:16,616 --> 00:07:18,750
- Hey.
- Hey.

155
00:07:18,752 --> 00:07:20,618
Cayden is attacking
the city with a series

156
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,287
of coordinated hacks.

157
00:07:27,828 --> 00:07:30,128
He just crashed
a plane.

158
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,696
Yeah, I know.
I mean, he can hack anything

159
00:07:31,698 --> 00:07:33,465
that is connected
to the Internet,

160
00:07:33,467 --> 00:07:34,833
which is practically
everything these days,

161
00:07:34,835 --> 00:07:36,634
so I was thinking that
our teams,

162
00:07:36,636 --> 00:07:38,670
our two separate teams,

163
00:07:38,672 --> 00:07:43,208
could share information.

164
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:45,410
Yeah.
Uh, that's a good idea.

165
00:07:45,412 --> 00:07:47,679
We'll share any and all
information that can help.

166
00:07:47,681 --> 00:07:51,149
Ok. Thanks, Curtis.
I'll, uh, send you what I've got so far.

167
00:07:51,151 --> 00:07:53,485
I hope that was
all right, guys.

168
00:07:53,487 --> 00:07:55,386
I mean, I know we looked
at each other,

169
00:07:55,388 --> 00:07:56,654
but we didn't actually
verbalize.

170
00:07:56,656 --> 00:07:58,757
Oh, we agreed,
Curtis.

171
00:08:04,064 --> 00:08:05,730
Frank Pike is dead.

172
00:08:05,732 --> 00:08:07,532
What?

173
00:08:07,534 --> 00:08:10,168
He was killed by one
of Cayden James' hacks.

174
00:08:11,838 --> 00:08:13,838
Is Felicity
doing this?

175
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,276
Wait. That--

176
00:08:18,278 --> 00:08:20,411
that can't be.

177
00:08:20,413 --> 00:08:22,113
You know what?
The last time I saw it

178
00:08:22,115 --> 00:08:23,314
doing this, it was tracking
vigilante's visor.

179
00:08:23,316 --> 00:08:25,216
I know,
but he modified

180
00:08:25,218 --> 00:08:27,685
his electronics to block
our signal,

181
00:08:27,687 --> 00:08:30,221
but this is real.

182
00:08:30,223 --> 00:08:32,090
It's locking on to him.

183
00:08:32,092 --> 00:08:35,226
Because your balls
never malfunction?

184
00:08:35,228 --> 00:08:36,661
Really?

185
00:08:36,663 --> 00:08:38,396
Not this time,
all right,

186
00:08:38,398 --> 00:08:40,532
but, I mean, could he
have messed up?

187
00:08:40,534 --> 00:08:42,433
Did he forget
we could track him?

188
00:08:42,435 --> 00:08:44,202
No way.
He's too devious.

189
00:08:44,204 --> 00:08:46,070
I thing the son of a bitch
is trying to draw us out,

190
00:08:46,072 --> 00:08:47,639
trap us.

191
00:08:50,002 --> 00:08:52,110
I say we trap him.

192
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:56,108
You all in?

193
00:08:58,179 --> 00:08:59,879
1, 2, 3.

194
00:08:59,881 --> 00:09:01,547
Suit up!

195
00:09:05,953 --> 00:09:07,953
Yeah. I don't think we
should say "suit up" all together.

196
00:09:07,955 --> 00:09:09,622
It'd be really cool
if we did, though.

197
00:09:09,624 --> 00:09:11,190
I don't think it would
be really cool.

198
00:09:11,192 --> 00:09:12,992
I mean, let's just be
different than OTA.

199
00:09:12,994 --> 00:09:15,161
Let's be, like, NTA
and say it together.

200
00:09:15,163 --> 00:09:16,896
But we are NTA, and we're
cooler without having to say "suit up"...

201
00:09:16,898 --> 00:09:19,198
Just saying this is
kind of what Oliver was always doing.

202
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,200
I'm just saying
we should just try it one time.

203
00:09:23,471 --> 00:09:26,505
I'm sorry I'm late. There was
an airplane crash on State Street.

204
00:09:26,507 --> 00:09:28,741
It's awful. Is this
the Cayden James

205
00:09:28,743 --> 00:09:30,609
that you've been
talking about?

206
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:32,311
Most likely. Look. Quentin can bring
you up to speed.

207
00:09:32,313 --> 00:09:34,113
I've asked him to run
things here with your help.

208
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,848
- Absolutely.
- Yeah. Listen.

209
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,583
We've taken SCPD
systems offline.

210
00:09:37,585 --> 00:09:38,818
We're setting up
communication trees

211
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,653
so officers can talk
in person.

212
00:09:40,655 --> 00:09:42,688
Ok. Cool. It's just
like the old days.

213
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,090
I'm not that old.

214
00:09:44,092 --> 00:09:45,991
Look. I think it's
a great idea.

215
00:09:45,993 --> 00:09:48,027
We should take everything in the city's
government on analog,

216
00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:49,829
and that way, we're
out of James' reach.

217
00:09:49,831 --> 00:09:51,363
In the meantime,
we need to do everything

218
00:09:51,365 --> 00:09:53,232
that we can to
minimize panic.

219
00:09:53,234 --> 00:09:55,301
Why don't we
set up libraries,

220
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:58,137
uh, gyms, and civic centers
with SCPD protection?

221
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,905
- Yeah.
- We can take them

222
00:09:59,907 --> 00:10:02,141
completely off-grid,
people can come, feel safe.

223
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,542
Safe zones are a good idea.

224
00:10:03,544 --> 00:10:04,877
Now I have to get
back to city hall

225
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:07,012
with the death
of councilman Grovner.

226
00:10:07,014 --> 00:10:08,948
- No. Go. Don't worry.
- Go. Go, go, go, go. We got it.

227
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,649
- Ok.
- Good luck.

228
00:10:16,124 --> 00:10:18,290
I got nothing
in the alleyway.

229
00:10:18,292 --> 00:10:20,559
Same
for the parking garage.

230
00:10:20,561 --> 00:10:22,962
Zilch here.
Back to base?

231
00:10:22,964 --> 00:10:25,131
What was that?
The comms are breaking up.

232
00:10:25,133 --> 00:10:27,166
Yeah. I'm getting some interference
on my side, too.

233
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,701
Can you guys
hear me?

234
00:10:28,703 --> 00:10:32,071
No,
they can't.

235
00:10:32,073 --> 00:10:34,273
You're jamming us.

236
00:10:34,275 --> 00:10:36,308
I'll be brief.

237
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:38,377
I'm on your side.

238
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:41,046
Cayden James is
my target, too.

239
00:10:41,048 --> 00:10:43,215
I'm undercover
with his organization.

240
00:10:43,217 --> 00:10:45,951
You think this "T" on my face
stands for gullible?

241
00:10:45,953 --> 00:10:47,419
You know what I mean.

242
00:10:47,421 --> 00:10:49,288
I tried telling
Dinah last week,

243
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,956
but she didn't
give me the chance.

244
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:54,026
Right now, James is
killing dozens of people.

245
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,762
By tonight, it will
be hundreds.

246
00:10:56,764 --> 00:10:59,965
I need your help.

247
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:03,602
Why should I trust you?

248
00:11:03,604 --> 00:11:05,204
Go to the subway tunnels

249
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,206
where the red line
and the gold line cross

250
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,675
an hour from now.

251
00:11:09,677 --> 00:11:11,610
You might be able to
save some lives.

252
00:11:11,612 --> 00:11:15,414
Or I could lead
my teammates into a trap.

253
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:18,417
I could have trapped
you here,

254
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:20,419
but I didn't.

255
00:11:29,463 --> 00:11:33,999
Harold Grovner was
a dedicated civil servant,

256
00:11:34,001 --> 00:11:36,635
who always wanted
what was best for this city,

257
00:11:36,637 --> 00:11:40,206
and we will not
forget that,

258
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,141
but with everything
that is happening,

259
00:11:42,143 --> 00:11:46,111
we don't have the time
to mourn at the moment,

260
00:11:46,113 --> 00:11:48,647
so, please, let's get
back to work.

261
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:52,351
Becky, I need councilmen Gattis,
McCaskill, and Kullens.

262
00:11:52,353 --> 00:11:53,586
In that order, please.

263
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:55,254
Your 10 am is here.

264
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:56,789
I don't have a 10 am
on my schedule,

265
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:59,325
and even if I did, I--

266
00:11:59,327 --> 00:12:02,595
I think you'll find
this one's rather important.

267
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:05,297
Ben Gale. Pleasure
to meet you, Mr. Mayor.

268
00:12:05,299 --> 00:12:07,933
Thanks for making
the time.

269
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,535
Thank you, Becky.

270
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,974
I'll let you make
the usual threats in a minute,

271
00:12:14,976 --> 00:12:17,243
but before we get
to that, you should know

272
00:12:17,245 --> 00:12:19,912
that my colleagues
are expecting to hear from me in 6,

273
00:12:19,914 --> 00:12:23,415
and if they don't,
well, you would be remiss

274
00:12:23,417 --> 00:12:26,252
in forgetting
the thermobaric explosive

275
00:12:26,254 --> 00:12:28,287
that remains
in my possession.

276
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,656
What...Do you want?

277
00:12:30,658 --> 00:12:33,459
I've already told you.

278
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,961
Vengeance for my son.

279
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:46,805
I cared for him,
protected him, loved him

280
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:50,175
just as you do this city,

281
00:12:50,177 --> 00:12:54,313
but now...your city's
entire infrastructure

282
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,148
is under my control--

283
00:12:56,150 --> 00:13:00,185
buildings, institutions,
even people,

284
00:13:00,187 --> 00:13:01,720
all under my dominion.

285
00:13:01,722 --> 00:13:03,322
These are innocent
people.

286
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,324
And you can save them...

287
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,597
by wiring $10 million

288
00:13:11,599 --> 00:13:14,400
into that offshore account

289
00:13:14,402 --> 00:13:17,603
no later
than 11:30 tonight...

290
00:13:21,142 --> 00:13:25,878
And every night
until further notice.

291
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:30,749
That will bankrupt us!

292
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,951
Well, I certainly
hope so.

293
00:13:32,953 --> 00:13:34,320
Please don't imagine
that I've gone

294
00:13:34,322 --> 00:13:35,888
to these lengths
for money.

295
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:39,925
No. This is for you
so that you'll suffer.

296
00:13:39,927 --> 00:13:42,127
I didn't kill your son.

297
00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:44,596
Yes, you did.

298
00:13:44,598 --> 00:13:47,499
One year ago
this very day

299
00:13:47,501 --> 00:13:49,702
right here
in Star City,

300
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:52,571
you missed your
intended target,

301
00:13:52,573 --> 00:13:56,408
but your arrow found
its way into my boy.

302
00:13:58,412 --> 00:14:00,412
Well, if you're
seeking vengeance,

303
00:14:00,414 --> 00:14:03,415
if you want revenge...

304
00:14:05,252 --> 00:14:06,885
Why haven't you just
outed me

305
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,354
as the Green Arrow?

306
00:14:08,356 --> 00:14:10,422
If my understanding
is correct,

307
00:14:10,424 --> 00:14:13,759
that's already
been done.

308
00:14:13,761 --> 00:14:16,161
Star City will not
negotiate with a terrorist.

309
00:14:16,163 --> 00:14:19,765
Oh, spare me
the political claptrap, Mr. Queen.

310
00:14:19,767 --> 00:14:23,001
By tonight, that will sound hollow,
even to you.

311
00:14:38,012 --> 00:14:39,245
Come on.

312
00:14:39,247 --> 00:14:40,212
You ok?

313
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:42,982
I have tried
every trick

314
00:14:42,984 --> 00:14:44,917
to counter-hack what
Cayden is doing,

315
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:46,986
and I am completely
boxed out,

316
00:14:46,988 --> 00:14:49,221
so I contacted Alena to
help me figure out why,

317
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:51,824
and the answer is,
is that it's my fault.

318
00:14:51,826 --> 00:14:53,793
Felicity, what are you
talking about?

319
00:14:53,795 --> 00:14:56,295
When we stopped Cayden and Laurel
from blowing up the Internet vault...

320
00:14:56,297 --> 00:14:58,097
Uh-huh.

321
00:14:58,099 --> 00:14:59,732
That was all a ruse.

322
00:14:59,734 --> 00:15:01,267
Cayden just wanted us
to think that people

323
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:02,768
were in trouble so
that I would break

324
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,570
through his firewall,

325
00:15:04,572 --> 00:15:06,205
but instead
of blocking him,

326
00:15:06,207 --> 00:15:08,274
I was actually just
helping him plant a virus,

327
00:15:08,276 --> 00:15:10,443
and now he has complete
control of the entire city.

328
00:15:10,445 --> 00:15:13,679
A hack-cident is
killing one person every 18 minutes,

329
00:15:13,681 --> 00:15:15,314
and I have no idea
how to stop it.

330
00:15:15,316 --> 00:15:18,617
I do
thanks to Cayden James,

331
00:15:18,619 --> 00:15:20,619
who was kind enough to pay
me a visit at city hall.

332
00:15:20,621 --> 00:15:23,989
- What'd he want?
- He wants $10 million a day.

333
00:15:23,991 --> 00:15:25,958
That is not
the actionable part.

334
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,260
He told me the details
of his son's death.

335
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:30,196
He was killed one year
ago today.

336
00:15:30,198 --> 00:15:31,697
Cayden thinks that he was
collateral damage

337
00:15:31,699 --> 00:15:34,934
from a fight that I had
in Star City.

338
00:15:34,936 --> 00:15:36,469
It's not possible.

339
00:15:36,471 --> 00:15:38,070
You were in Hub City
recruiting Dinah.

340
00:15:38,072 --> 00:15:39,438
Yep.

341
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,307
If Cayden James is
motivated by revenge,

342
00:15:41,309 --> 00:15:42,942
maybe we can get him
to stand down.

343
00:15:42,944 --> 00:15:44,777
Well, I like that idea
because I have no way

344
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:46,312
of stopping him my way,
and I have no location

345
00:15:46,314 --> 00:15:48,047
for you to find
him your way.

346
00:15:48,049 --> 00:15:50,015
Felicity, we need
incontrovertible proof.

347
00:15:50,017 --> 00:15:52,051
Yeah. I know.
I'm on it.

348
00:15:52,053 --> 00:15:55,121
I can't believe we
didn't catch Vincent.

349
00:15:55,123 --> 00:15:58,157
He had a 20-minute
lead on us.

350
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:00,159
- Where have you been?
- Long story.

351
00:16:00,161 --> 00:16:02,561
I need to check
on something.

352
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,300
- Hey.
- Hey. If we're still sharing

353
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:10,469
Intel, I need you
to check on something for me.

354
00:16:10,471 --> 00:16:12,071
- Yeah. Shoot.
- The subway system,

355
00:16:12,073 --> 00:16:14,440
specifically where the Red
and Gold line meet.

356
00:16:14,442 --> 00:16:16,642
I'm trying to stave off
a disaster.

357
00:16:16,644 --> 00:16:18,778
Yeah. The automatic
track signals just went offline.

358
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,880
- How'd you know?
- Lucky guess.

359
00:16:20,882 --> 00:16:22,715
- You want backup?
- Felicity, I appreciate

360
00:16:22,717 --> 00:16:24,917
the Intel, but we're
not working together anymore.

361
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:26,852
My team can handle it.

362
00:16:28,022 --> 00:16:30,256
Handle what?

363
00:16:30,258 --> 00:16:32,358
Cayden James is gonna attack
the subway

364
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,026
in less than an hour.

365
00:16:34,028 --> 00:16:35,728
I'd say "suit up,"
but we already are.

366
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,663
Let's go.

367
00:16:37,665 --> 00:16:39,932
Hey, guys.
Take a look at this.

368
00:16:39,934 --> 00:16:41,634
This is the city's
transportation system,

369
00:16:41,636 --> 00:16:44,336
and these are all the accidents that
have happened so far.

370
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:45,905
A lot
around the edges.

371
00:16:45,907 --> 00:16:47,706
The train lines
and the freeways.

372
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:49,508
He's laying siege
to the city.

373
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,843
That's probably why he
wanted the port.

374
00:16:50,845 --> 00:16:52,211
It's exactly
what he's doing.

375
00:16:52,213 --> 00:16:54,046
He wants to block off
all the exit routes.

376
00:16:54,048 --> 00:16:56,282
And stop all the reinforcements
from the outside.

377
00:16:56,284 --> 00:16:58,617
Any roads he
hasn't hit yet?

378
00:16:58,619 --> 00:16:59,985
Yeah. There's one exit
left out of the city,

379
00:16:59,987 --> 00:17:01,587
and it's the tunnel.

380
00:17:03,925 --> 00:17:05,758
William.

381
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:24,610
I saw your new mom
on TV.

382
00:17:24,612 --> 00:17:28,147
She's pretty hot.
Heh heh.

383
00:17:28,149 --> 00:17:30,483
She read you
bedtime stories?

384
00:17:30,485 --> 00:17:33,352
Well, at least she can read,
unlike your mom.

385
00:17:35,289 --> 00:17:38,791
This field trip,
it's gonna be fun.

386
00:17:39,994 --> 00:17:42,394
- You sure you're good?
- Yep. Never better.

387
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:44,697
Had Cisco put
this together.

388
00:17:46,634 --> 00:17:48,000
You ok?

389
00:17:48,002 --> 00:17:50,102
Yeah. Yeah.

390
00:17:50,104 --> 00:17:51,637
Suit up!

391
00:17:55,476 --> 00:17:57,610
Let's go save your son.

392
00:17:59,914 --> 00:18:01,747
Careful around
these metal lines.

393
00:18:01,749 --> 00:18:03,782
Sometimes, they can
be electrified.

394
00:18:03,784 --> 00:18:05,818
I know that, T.
I'm not 6.

395
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,654
I didn't know that.

396
00:18:08,656 --> 00:18:10,990
Hey. These tracks
are set to cross.

397
00:18:10,992 --> 00:18:12,791
The trains are
gonna collide.

398
00:18:12,793 --> 00:18:14,793
That could be
the switch, that lever.

399
00:18:14,795 --> 00:18:16,662
Pull it.

400
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,267
Uh! It's stuck.

401
00:18:21,269 --> 00:18:22,968
These switch boxes
are locked, though.

402
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:24,904
All right. Stand back.

403
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:30,309
There we go.

404
00:18:30,311 --> 00:18:33,479
Ok. Well, plan B--
actually, there is no plan B

405
00:18:33,481 --> 00:18:35,514
because Cayden James
has completely overwritten

406
00:18:35,516 --> 00:18:37,016
everything we
could do here.

407
00:18:37,018 --> 00:18:39,485
- Maybe plan C will be--
- Guys.

408
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:41,120
We could literally
just start pulling things out

409
00:18:41,122 --> 00:18:43,689
till we get
the right circuit.

410
00:18:43,691 --> 00:18:44,823
Guys!

411
00:18:46,527 --> 00:18:49,361
Pull it all out,
pull it all out.

412
00:18:49,363 --> 00:18:51,864
It's not working.
Hurry!

413
00:18:51,866 --> 00:18:52,865
Hey. What's plan D?

414
00:18:52,867 --> 00:18:54,199
- There is no plan D.
- What?

415
00:18:54,542 --> 00:18:56,175
Yes, there is!

416
00:19:09,925 --> 00:19:11,791
Whoo!

417
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:18,064
All right. I'm gonna go
see what's going on.

418
00:19:18,066 --> 00:19:19,465
You kids stay put.

419
00:19:32,647 --> 00:19:34,647
I'm bored, Clayton.

420
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:37,417
Read us a story.

421
00:19:41,356 --> 00:19:42,722
We have to get
out of here.

422
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:45,158
Everyone stay calm
and follow me.

423
00:19:47,929 --> 00:19:49,462
We have to get
out the back!

424
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:58,404
We can still make it out.

425
00:20:00,608 --> 00:20:02,208
Ok. Come on.
Move it, move it!

426
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:03,509
You two,
help them out!

427
00:20:03,511 --> 00:20:05,411
Hurry, hurry!

428
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:08,648
Donnie.

429
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,316
We need to get out of here.
Come on, come on.

430
00:20:10,318 --> 00:20:12,919
- I can't, I can't.
- We need to go! Go!

431
00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:16,255
I need you to go. Go!

432
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:24,864
William!
William!

433
00:20:27,569 --> 00:20:28,968
Where's William's bus?

434
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,970
Go. I'll take care
of everyone else.

435
00:20:42,183 --> 00:20:44,417
Go for the door,
go for the door! Move!

436
00:20:44,419 --> 00:20:47,220
Come on, come on!
Get to the door!

437
00:20:47,222 --> 00:20:48,955
Move, move!

438
00:20:56,598 --> 00:20:58,798
Through here,
through here.

439
00:20:59,868 --> 00:21:03,970
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go!

440
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:05,605
Come on.

441
00:21:05,607 --> 00:21:07,106
Where's William Clayton?

442
00:21:07,108 --> 00:21:08,307
He's stuck
behind the sign.

443
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:09,475
Go, go!

444
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:14,313
Come on!

445
00:21:27,095 --> 00:21:29,562
William, William.

446
00:21:29,564 --> 00:21:30,563
You ok?

447
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:37,103
Dad?

448
00:21:48,326 --> 00:21:50,493
We got everyone
out safely.

449
00:21:50,495 --> 00:21:52,928
Unfortunately, that tunnel
was the last way out of the city.

450
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:55,639
So this is your
secret hideout?

451
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,573
Yeah.

452
00:21:57,575 --> 00:22:02,178
You said you weren't
the Green Arrow anymore.

453
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,980
John did take
over for me,

454
00:22:03,982 --> 00:22:05,815
but he got injured.

455
00:22:07,051 --> 00:22:09,252
He's not injured
anymore.

456
00:22:09,254 --> 00:22:10,987
No, he's not.

457
00:22:10,989 --> 00:22:14,190
We've lost the other members
of our team, William,

458
00:22:14,192 --> 00:22:18,060
and I can't have him
out there on his own right now

459
00:22:18,062 --> 00:22:20,196
with everything
that's going on.

460
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:24,033
Listen, buddy.
I promise--

461
00:22:24,035 --> 00:22:25,935
You've promised before.

462
00:22:30,742 --> 00:22:33,209
I need to go
meet your aunt Thea.

463
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,847
Could you please
hang here?

464
00:22:47,725 --> 00:22:49,959
Damn,
that was on fire!

465
00:22:51,629 --> 00:22:53,229
Hey, man. New team Arrow's
kicking ass.

466
00:22:53,231 --> 00:22:54,730
You know what?
I really have to say

467
00:22:54,732 --> 00:22:56,466
that I think we should
change our name.

468
00:22:56,468 --> 00:22:58,401
Like, what do you guys
think about The Outsiders?

469
00:22:58,403 --> 00:23:02,939
Ooh. Um, I think it was
a really awesome book.

470
00:23:02,941 --> 00:23:06,609
You know, guys, talking
to Felicity actually was a good idea.

471
00:23:06,611 --> 00:23:07,977
I mean, if she hadn't
given us that Intel,

472
00:23:07,979 --> 00:23:09,278
those people
would be dead.

473
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,647
About that.

474
00:23:11,649 --> 00:23:14,050
I got that information
from Vincent Sobel.

475
00:23:15,453 --> 00:23:16,986
I'm sorry. What?

476
00:23:16,988 --> 00:23:19,021
I didn't trust him
at first either, ok,

477
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:20,990
but I called Felicity
to confirm

478
00:23:20,992 --> 00:23:23,893
if his Intel checked out,
and it did, clearly.

479
00:23:23,895 --> 00:23:26,896
And that's why you were
late getting back here earlier.

480
00:23:26,898 --> 00:23:28,464
You were talking to him?

481
00:23:28,466 --> 00:23:30,233
So you didn't
bother telling us?

482
00:23:30,235 --> 00:23:32,001
How very
Oliver Queen of you.

483
00:23:32,003 --> 00:23:33,569
I had to get
all the information first

484
00:23:33,571 --> 00:23:35,271
before I looped
you guys in.

485
00:23:35,273 --> 00:23:36,873
Then once I did have
all the information,

486
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:38,407
we had to stop
a subway collision,

487
00:23:38,409 --> 00:23:40,409
but we did,
and now here I am,

488
00:23:40,411 --> 00:23:41,911
telling you guys.

489
00:23:41,913 --> 00:23:43,946
Telling us what?

490
00:23:43,948 --> 00:23:45,815
Why would Vince
help us?

491
00:23:45,817 --> 00:23:47,383
He says he's
a double agent working

492
00:23:47,385 --> 00:23:49,252
to take down Cayden James
from the inside.

493
00:23:49,254 --> 00:23:51,420
I mean, that
does track.

494
00:23:51,422 --> 00:23:52,889
I mean, the guy used
to be undercover.

495
00:23:52,891 --> 00:23:55,691
Which makes him
a professional liar.

496
00:23:55,693 --> 00:23:58,261
He has had so many
opportunities to tell me

497
00:23:58,263 --> 00:23:59,962
he is a double agent.

498
00:23:59,964 --> 00:24:01,364
Why hasn't he?

499
00:24:01,366 --> 00:24:02,899
He just somehow
forgot to mention it?

500
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:04,734
He says he tried to.

501
00:24:04,736 --> 00:24:07,270
That is absolute crap.

502
00:24:07,272 --> 00:24:09,739
Maybe, but if he
turns out to be legit,

503
00:24:09,741 --> 00:24:11,107
he could offer
a tactical advantage

504
00:24:11,109 --> 00:24:12,775
that we can't
turn down.

505
00:24:12,777 --> 00:24:15,077
Well, I can, because
I will never work

506
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:16,712
with him again, ever.

507
00:24:16,714 --> 00:24:19,248
Well, obviously,
Curtis and I disagree, so...

508
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,684
So nothing.

509
00:24:21,686 --> 00:24:26,289
We all have to agree,
don't we,

510
00:24:26,291 --> 00:24:29,525
or are we just
screwing consensus now?

511
00:24:37,569 --> 00:24:39,569
Ok. So maybe
you can get some of your officers

512
00:24:39,571 --> 00:24:41,137
and have them stand
over there.

513
00:24:41,139 --> 00:24:42,939
- You bet.
- That'd be great. Thank you.

514
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:44,774
Thought that would
put a little extra pep in your step.

515
00:24:44,776 --> 00:24:46,075
You are my savior.

516
00:24:46,077 --> 00:24:48,377
What, me
or the coffee?

517
00:24:48,379 --> 00:24:49,845
Why can't it
just be both?

518
00:24:49,847 --> 00:24:51,981
- Hey. How are things going here?
-Hi.

519
00:24:51,983 --> 00:24:54,116
Well, it's not good.
No. We got no customers at all.

520
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:56,118
There's so much
happening right now

521
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,954
that people are too scared to
even come to the safe zones.

522
00:24:57,956 --> 00:25:00,056
And worse still,
I got cops standing around here

523
00:25:00,058 --> 00:25:01,824
doing nothing when
they could be out there helping people.

524
00:25:01,826 --> 00:25:03,693
I would like
to redeploy them.

525
00:25:03,695 --> 00:25:05,962
No. If--if we get
people here,

526
00:25:05,964 --> 00:25:07,830
then we don't need to
worry about protecting them out there.

527
00:25:07,832 --> 00:25:10,800
We have no idea where Cayden James is
going to attack next.

528
00:25:10,802 --> 00:25:13,102
The best thing that
we can do for the city

529
00:25:13,104 --> 00:25:16,806
is to get people
to the safe zones.

530
00:25:16,808 --> 00:25:18,908
Could you please call
the press?

531
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,142
I have an idea.

532
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:21,978
Ok.

533
00:25:24,282 --> 00:25:26,515
- Yes!
- You got something?

534
00:25:26,517 --> 00:25:28,317
A bull's-eye. Alena
remembered that

535
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:30,319
last May, Cayden received a package
from Corto Maltese,

536
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:32,688
and she thinks that
in that package was the evidence that

537
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:34,490
made Cayden think that
Oliver killed Owen.

538
00:25:34,492 --> 00:25:36,025
And how exactly
is that a bull's-eye?

539
00:25:36,027 --> 00:25:37,827
Because we know Oliver
didn't kill Owen,

540
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:39,495
so whatever was in that package,
that evidence--

541
00:25:39,497 --> 00:25:42,164
That evidence had to
have been faked somehow.

542
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:46,168
- Bull's-eye! Boom.
- Right.

543
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,037
You ok?

544
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:50,906
Yeah. Yeah, it's just--
just stupid.

545
00:25:50,908 --> 00:25:53,242
Well, you don't
do stupid, so...

546
00:25:54,612 --> 00:25:57,013
I don't know.
I was just hoping that

547
00:25:57,015 --> 00:25:59,281
since the implant was
working so well that maybe--

548
00:25:59,283 --> 00:26:01,517
You'd be putting
the hood back on?

549
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:04,353
- Yeah.
- I'm sure you will,

550
00:26:04,355 --> 00:26:06,389
you know, once this
whole Cayden thing is dealt with.

551
00:26:06,391 --> 00:26:09,025
I hope so.

552
00:26:09,027 --> 00:26:11,360
I hope so
for his sake.

553
00:26:11,362 --> 00:26:13,162
Oh, man.
He just found out

554
00:26:13,164 --> 00:26:16,165
that his father's
been lying to him for a month.

555
00:26:16,167 --> 00:26:18,401
I've been trying to work up the courage
to talk with him,

556
00:26:18,403 --> 00:26:22,805
but, like, step-mom
in training over here.

557
00:26:22,807 --> 00:26:24,874
You'll do fine, Felicity.

558
00:26:24,876 --> 00:26:26,942
Mr. Mayor.
Mr. Mayor...

559
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:28,577
Hey, Will.
Your dad's on TV.

560
00:26:28,579 --> 00:26:30,179
What is happening
to this city?

561
00:26:30,181 --> 00:26:31,614
Are we under
some kind of attack?

562
00:26:31,616 --> 00:26:33,549
Ahem. A hacker--

563
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:35,851
goes by the name
Cayden James--

564
00:26:35,853 --> 00:26:39,055
has taken over the electronic
infrastructure of Star City.

565
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:43,059
In his hands, anything--
anything that is connected

566
00:26:43,061 --> 00:26:47,063
to the Internet
can be used as a weapon.

567
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:49,165
Now, sadly, this has
already led

568
00:26:49,167 --> 00:26:51,400
to a number of casualties,

569
00:26:51,402 --> 00:26:55,271
including our police captain,
Frank Pike,

570
00:26:55,273 --> 00:26:59,575
and councilman Harold Grovner.

571
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:02,078
But Mr. James has
made his demands,

572
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,881
but make no mistake,
he is a terrorist,

573
00:27:05,883 --> 00:27:12,088
and Star City does not negotiate
with terrorists, period.

574
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:15,524
Instead, we are gonna focus
on the safety and well-being

575
00:27:15,526 --> 00:27:17,426
of our citizens.

576
00:27:17,428 --> 00:27:21,497
In that spirit, the SCPD
has set up safe houses throughout the city.

577
00:27:21,499 --> 00:27:24,266
These locations are
entirely analog,

578
00:27:24,268 --> 00:27:26,102
and you will be safe there.

579
00:27:26,104 --> 00:27:29,305
I promise you, you will
be safe there.

580
00:27:31,242 --> 00:27:35,311
Mr. James, Star City has
survived far worse than you.

581
00:27:35,313 --> 00:27:39,315
We will band together,
we will be united,

582
00:27:39,317 --> 00:27:41,951
and we will survive this.

583
00:27:41,953 --> 00:27:43,352
Thank you very much.

584
00:27:43,354 --> 00:27:46,355
So predictable.

585
00:27:46,357 --> 00:27:48,958
Almost takes the fun
out of it.

586
00:27:52,465 --> 00:27:54,997
Time to proceed
to the next phase.

587
00:28:05,698 --> 00:28:07,798
Nice speech,
and it worked.

588
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,700
Safe zones are filling up,
they're completely offline,

589
00:28:09,702 --> 00:28:15,573
and hack-cident free,
and in other news...Yeah--

590
00:28:16,046 --> 00:28:18,112
I might have a thing
on our other thing.

591
00:28:18,114 --> 00:28:19,814
On Cayden James' son?

592
00:28:19,816 --> 00:28:22,383
So Alena thinks that Cayden believes
that you killed his son

593
00:28:22,385 --> 00:28:24,686
because of something that arrived
in a package from Corto Maltese in May.

594
00:28:24,688 --> 00:28:26,654
Through a pretty cool
sequence of hacks on the mail systems

595
00:28:26,656 --> 00:28:28,690
of several different countries--
not that you need to know

596
00:28:28,692 --> 00:28:30,725
about it, but it was,
like, really intense and really cool,

597
00:28:30,727 --> 00:28:33,027
and I did it, and it was really hard,
but you don't need

598
00:28:33,029 --> 00:28:35,463
to know about those.
In that package was a USB drive,

599
00:28:35,465 --> 00:28:37,398
and we actually have that USB drive's
serial number, so Alena's just working

600
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,601
on trying to find the computer in Corto
Maltese that uploaded

601
00:28:39,603 --> 00:28:41,636
the information onto that drive that
Cayden received,

602
00:28:41,638 --> 00:28:43,137
the information
that made him think

603
00:28:43,139 --> 00:28:44,606
that you
killed his son.

604
00:28:44,608 --> 00:28:46,407
You see how I came full circle
on that, right?

605
00:28:46,409 --> 00:28:48,443
- 100%.
- Awesome.

606
00:28:52,215 --> 00:28:54,515
You should go
talk to him.

607
00:28:56,086 --> 00:28:57,785
I will.

608
00:29:13,003 --> 00:29:14,602
- Dinah.
- Hey.

609
00:29:14,604 --> 00:29:16,971
If you don't want
to work with him,

610
00:29:16,973 --> 00:29:18,239
we won't.

611
00:29:18,241 --> 00:29:22,477
We do it by consensus
like we agreed.

612
00:29:22,479 --> 00:29:25,680
Hey. Look.
I--I acknowledge

613
00:29:25,682 --> 00:29:28,016
that Vince is
a complicated variable, ok?

614
00:29:28,018 --> 00:29:30,018
Well, let's
break it down.

615
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:33,488
You know, pro/con style.

616
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:35,323
All right.

617
00:29:35,325 --> 00:29:37,759
Pro--he's really good,

618
00:29:37,761 --> 00:29:41,162
and he gets deep
into his assignments.

619
00:29:41,164 --> 00:29:45,600
Con--on our last assignment,
he got in too deep.

620
00:29:45,602 --> 00:29:48,036
He can forget
what side he's on.

621
00:29:48,038 --> 00:29:52,306
Pro--he's in with Cayden James
and his crew,

622
00:29:52,308 --> 00:29:54,042
and his last Intel
worked.

623
00:29:54,044 --> 00:29:56,144
If you didn't know
Vincent,

624
00:29:56,146 --> 00:29:59,614
if you could remove
this history with him,

625
00:29:59,616 --> 00:30:03,484
if, as a cop, he came to you
with some Intel,

626
00:30:03,486 --> 00:30:05,019
what would your
gut tell you?

627
00:30:05,021 --> 00:30:07,255
Do we have new Intel
from him?

628
00:30:07,257 --> 00:30:08,790
No.

629
00:30:08,792 --> 00:30:12,160
Well, then I'm not
gonna answer that yet.

630
00:30:18,568 --> 00:30:22,704
You know, there's, um,
a study I was reading

631
00:30:22,706 --> 00:30:26,708
that was saying that
actually talking to a child

632
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:30,311
is one of the most
effective parenting techniques.

633
00:30:30,313 --> 00:30:31,379
- No kidding?
- Yeah.

634
00:30:31,381 --> 00:30:34,015
- That true?
- Yeah.

635
00:30:34,017 --> 00:30:37,185
Well, I've learned
several times the hard way

636
00:30:37,187 --> 00:30:43,391
that sometimes kids just
want to be left alone.

637
00:30:43,393 --> 00:30:45,226
I know I have to
talk to him.

638
00:30:45,228 --> 00:30:47,161
I'm just trying
to respect that.

639
00:30:47,163 --> 00:30:51,232
Ok. And I might totally be
projecting here

640
00:30:51,234 --> 00:30:52,967
because my dad was

641
00:30:52,969 --> 00:30:55,770
a, you know, supervillain
evil hacktivist,

642
00:30:55,772 --> 00:31:01,242
but he did a lot
of things

643
00:31:01,244 --> 00:31:03,010
that I didn't like
or approve of,

644
00:31:03,012 --> 00:31:05,613
and the way he chose
to live his life,

645
00:31:05,615 --> 00:31:08,249
that's not the part
that bugged me.

646
00:31:08,251 --> 00:31:10,051
Ok. What bugged you?

647
00:31:10,053 --> 00:31:11,352
The lie.

648
00:31:11,354 --> 00:31:13,020
All I ever wanted
was for him

649
00:31:13,022 --> 00:31:15,289
to tell me
the truth, you know,

650
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:16,591
and that's all
William wants.

651
00:31:16,593 --> 00:31:18,059
All he wants to
know is the truth--

652
00:31:18,061 --> 00:31:19,527
the good, the bad,
the ugly.

653
00:31:19,529 --> 00:31:20,762
He just wants to
know the truth.

654
00:31:20,764 --> 00:31:21,929
William knows the truth,

655
00:31:21,931 --> 00:31:25,433
or he--he knew
the truth,

656
00:31:25,435 --> 00:31:27,602
and he decided that
he didn't want me

657
00:31:27,604 --> 00:31:29,137
in situations
where he might lose me.

658
00:31:29,139 --> 00:31:31,439
Ok, but here we are,
and everything

659
00:31:31,441 --> 00:31:33,274
that's happened
with John

660
00:31:33,276 --> 00:31:35,409
and everything
that's happened with the team,

661
00:31:35,411 --> 00:31:36,744
and everything that is happening right now
with Cayden James.

662
00:31:36,746 --> 00:31:38,613
Here we are,

663
00:31:38,615 --> 00:31:41,616
and you know what
I think?

664
00:31:41,618 --> 00:31:45,153
I think William
can handle it.

665
00:31:45,155 --> 00:31:48,055
- I don't know.
- I do

666
00:31:48,057 --> 00:31:52,693
because, you know,
genetics.

667
00:31:59,469 --> 00:32:02,470
Aren't you ready yet?

668
00:32:02,472 --> 00:32:05,373
We're moving out.

669
00:32:05,375 --> 00:32:07,441
I'll be right there.

670
00:32:21,491 --> 00:32:23,457
- What's going on?
- Vincent's using the link

671
00:32:23,459 --> 00:32:25,459
to my T-sphere
to send a message.

672
00:32:25,461 --> 00:32:27,628
Morse code.

673
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:30,164
Clever.
What does it say?

674
00:32:30,166 --> 00:32:33,467
"Attack...

675
00:32:33,469 --> 00:32:35,736
"Oak...

676
00:32:35,738 --> 00:32:38,472
"Street...

677
00:32:38,474 --> 00:32:40,474
Now."

678
00:32:40,476 --> 00:32:43,477
I'm assuming that's a warning,
not a directive.

679
00:32:43,479 --> 00:32:45,046
Oak Street is one
of the safe zones

680
00:32:45,048 --> 00:32:47,815
Oliver and Quentin
set up.

681
00:32:47,817 --> 00:32:49,650
What do we do?

682
00:32:52,555 --> 00:32:54,422
Suit up.

683
00:33:00,413 --> 00:33:02,880
Officers marching,
guns out,

684
00:33:02,882 --> 00:33:04,549
city under siege.

685
00:33:04,551 --> 00:33:06,584
It's like
"Escape From Detroit."

686
00:33:06,586 --> 00:33:08,186
I don't know whether
to correct you

687
00:33:08,188 --> 00:33:10,221
or to just embrace
your attempt

688
00:33:10,223 --> 00:33:11,856
at referencing one of my
favorite John Carpenter films.

689
00:33:11,858 --> 00:33:13,308
- Huh?
- I think the point

690
00:33:13,309 --> 00:33:14,841
is that people
are scared.

691
00:33:14,842 --> 00:33:16,809
It's not good.

692
00:33:16,811 --> 00:33:18,911
They should
be scared.

693
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:20,513
That's why they need us.

694
00:33:20,515 --> 00:33:22,481
When you say, "us,"
do you mean just you

695
00:33:22,483 --> 00:33:24,750
and it's a passive dig
at our team--

696
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,886
no pun intended--
or do you mean

697
00:33:26,888 --> 00:33:30,089
all of us and you recognize our own team
as being independent--

698
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,290
Curtis, we got
your message.

699
00:33:31,292 --> 00:33:32,825
Thanks for
reaching out.

700
00:33:32,827 --> 00:33:34,760
So what are we dealing
with here?

701
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:36,495
We have it
on good authority

702
00:33:36,497 --> 00:33:38,097
this place is
Cayden James' next target.

703
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,199
- How do you know?
- We know.

704
00:33:40,201 --> 00:33:42,168
That's all that matters.

705
00:33:59,487 --> 00:34:02,488
Not to spoil the really
awkward team reunion,

706
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:04,123
but you have incoming.

707
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:06,392
Whoa. You have lots
of incoming.

708
00:34:09,864 --> 00:34:12,198
We need to
move out right now!

709
00:34:20,041 --> 00:34:21,640
Is dad gonna be ok?

710
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:23,576
Yeah, he's gonna be fine.

711
00:34:23,578 --> 00:34:25,378
Look. I know you're not
all that happy with your dad right now,

712
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,380
but this--this is what
he does best,

713
00:34:27,382 --> 00:34:29,382
and nobody does it
better.

714
00:34:29,384 --> 00:34:31,183
But everybody
makes mistakes.

715
00:34:31,185 --> 00:34:32,518
Things go wrong.

716
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,221
He can't plan
for everything.

717
00:34:35,223 --> 00:34:37,356
Yeah, you're right.

718
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:44,597
What your dad does,
it's---it's very dangerous,

719
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:48,401
and heroes don't
always make it home.

720
00:34:48,403 --> 00:34:50,569
I never forget that.

721
00:34:57,712 --> 00:35:02,181
But, you know,
I've loved your dad

722
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,482
from the first time
he brought me

723
00:35:03,484 --> 00:35:05,017
a bullet-riddled computer.

724
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:07,453
Remind me to tell you
about that one.

725
00:35:07,455 --> 00:35:09,155
That was
a long time ago,

726
00:35:09,157 --> 00:35:11,057
which means I've loved
him for a long time,

727
00:35:11,059 --> 00:35:14,326
which means I've worried about him
for a long time,

728
00:35:14,328 --> 00:35:17,363
and he--he hasn't
always been truthful.

729
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:19,098
He's lied,
he's kept secrets.

730
00:35:20,268 --> 00:35:21,834
He's not perfect.

731
00:35:21,836 --> 00:35:24,236
This life, it's--
it's not ideal--heh--

732
00:35:24,238 --> 00:35:26,105
but he makes
his sacrifices,

733
00:35:26,107 --> 00:35:29,241
so we have to make ours.

734
00:35:29,243 --> 00:35:31,243
I sometimes think to myself that that's
what makes this love

735
00:35:31,245 --> 00:35:33,079
deeper than other kinds
of love.

736
00:35:33,081 --> 00:35:35,247
You know, it sounds
cheesy,

737
00:35:35,249 --> 00:35:37,850
but it does because
we can't take things for granted.

738
00:35:37,852 --> 00:35:39,852
We have to live with the fear
and the uncertainty

739
00:35:39,854 --> 00:35:42,254
that everything can be taken from us
in an instant...

740
00:35:42,256 --> 00:35:46,292
Traitor! I'm taking
you to hell with--

741
00:35:48,329 --> 00:35:50,162
Because that's
the price we pay

742
00:35:50,164 --> 00:35:52,631
for choosing the people
that we love.

743
00:35:52,633 --> 00:35:55,468
Everything he does
he does for a good reason

744
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:59,405
or what he thinks is
a good reason,

745
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,774
so you can worry
about your dad,

746
00:36:01,776 --> 00:36:04,310
but you have to believe

747
00:36:04,312 --> 00:36:07,513
that he's going to be ok

748
00:36:07,515 --> 00:36:10,983
because that's the only
way that this works.

749
00:36:10,985 --> 00:36:12,952
Ok?

750
00:36:12,954 --> 00:36:16,322
Ok. Now watch.

751
00:36:16,324 --> 00:36:17,857
Now after he takes
these two down,

752
00:36:17,859 --> 00:36:19,325
he's going to spin,

753
00:36:19,327 --> 00:36:22,228
disarm him...Kick.

754
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:24,163
He's probably gonna
use the arrow right here!

755
00:36:24,165 --> 00:36:25,865
Oh! Ooh. Wow!
You probably should not

756
00:36:25,867 --> 00:36:27,466
have been allowed
to watch that.

757
00:36:27,468 --> 00:36:29,235
That's definitely
in parenting 101.

758
00:36:32,373 --> 00:36:34,340
Good work.

759
00:36:35,843 --> 00:36:38,144
Doesn't change
anything, Hoss.

760
00:36:47,188 --> 00:36:48,988
Come on.

761
00:36:50,858 --> 00:36:53,159
Wow. He's--he's
pretty--

762
00:36:53,161 --> 00:36:54,860
Amazing, yeah.

763
00:36:54,862 --> 00:36:58,063
Well, I was gonna
say badass.

764
00:36:58,065 --> 00:36:59,932
Badass.

765
00:37:06,068 --> 00:37:07,634
Well, for two teams
that do not trust each other,

766
00:37:07,636 --> 00:37:09,503
you guys worked
together pretty well.

767
00:37:09,505 --> 00:37:10,837
Well, except for the fact
that they never shared

768
00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:12,439
with us where they got
their information.

769
00:37:12,441 --> 00:37:14,775
What's happening?

770
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,193
Cayden's shutting down
all communications--

771
00:37:17,195 --> 00:37:20,463
e-mail, TV, cell phones,
Internet traffic, everything.

772
00:37:20,465 --> 00:37:22,031
We didn't meet
his 11:30 deadline.

773
00:37:22,033 --> 00:37:23,532
Can you please talk
to Alena and tell her

774
00:37:23,534 --> 00:37:25,568
that we are running
out of time?

775
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:27,970
I already did. She's working
as fast as she can.

776
00:37:27,972 --> 00:37:30,339
What are we gonna do?

777
00:37:30,341 --> 00:37:32,875
I need to go talk
to my son.

778
00:37:41,652 --> 00:37:44,720
You saved Rene's
life tonight.

779
00:37:44,722 --> 00:37:47,123
Thank you.

780
00:37:47,125 --> 00:37:49,191
I'm on your side, D.

781
00:37:49,193 --> 00:37:51,761
I wasn't so sure before.

782
00:37:51,763 --> 00:37:55,765
So...What now?

783
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:02,738
When I was growing up,
if something happened,

784
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:05,741
my dad would call
a family meeting

785
00:38:05,743 --> 00:38:09,578
so that we could all
talk about it.

786
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,280
And I know we've already
both talked to you separately,

787
00:38:11,282 --> 00:38:12,882
but we just thought
we'd all get together

788
00:38:12,884 --> 00:38:16,585
and just sort of talk it out,
put it all in the open.

789
00:38:18,756 --> 00:38:22,191
I'm terribly sorry
that I lied to you.

790
00:38:22,193 --> 00:38:24,927
There is no excuse for it,

791
00:38:24,929 --> 00:38:26,462
and I'm new at this
whole dad thing,

792
00:38:26,464 --> 00:38:28,030
but that's not
an excuse either.

793
00:38:28,032 --> 00:38:30,399
I've just--I've...

794
00:38:30,401 --> 00:38:33,803
Been trying to work
my way through it,

795
00:38:33,805 --> 00:38:37,339
and I've hit more bumps
in the road

796
00:38:37,341 --> 00:38:41,444
than I thought
that I would, as you know,

797
00:38:41,446 --> 00:38:44,180
but no more secrets
and no more lies,

798
00:38:44,182 --> 00:38:48,818
and, William, if you need me
to stop being the Green Arrow...

799
00:38:50,488 --> 00:38:52,488
I will.

800
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:56,792
Felicity showed me
what you did tonight.

801
00:38:56,794 --> 00:39:00,496
I got to say it was--
it was really cool.

802
00:39:02,967 --> 00:39:06,335
The city needs you,
and I get that now.

803
00:39:09,674 --> 00:39:11,440
Are you sure?

804
00:39:11,442 --> 00:39:13,409
Yeah. I mean, I was
worried before

805
00:39:13,411 --> 00:39:15,411
that I'd become
an orphan,

806
00:39:15,413 --> 00:39:17,246
but it's
different now.

807
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:19,315
I have Felicity.

808
00:39:19,317 --> 00:39:22,985
I understand why
you have to go out there.

809
00:39:25,823 --> 00:39:27,857
I'm gonna get
to bed.

810
00:39:29,727 --> 00:39:31,861
Sleep well, William, ok?

811
00:39:37,802 --> 00:39:40,236
What he said
was touching.

812
00:39:41,873 --> 00:39:44,440
It was kind of
awful, too.

813
00:39:44,442 --> 00:39:46,408
I think that's
the actual definition of bittersweet.

814
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:48,043
Ok. Well, don't let
it get to you.

815
00:39:48,045 --> 00:39:49,445
- I mean, it's--it's not.
- Oliver.

816
00:39:49,447 --> 00:39:51,413
It's not. It's--

817
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:57,887
if I've learned one thing
about parenting so far

818
00:39:57,889 --> 00:40:00,189
that I'm sure of...

819
00:40:01,826 --> 00:40:04,026
you can't win them all.

820
00:40:05,596 --> 00:40:07,229
Hmm.

821
00:40:14,572 --> 00:40:16,539
It's Alena.

822
00:40:18,476 --> 00:40:20,809
She went through
all the computers in Corto Maltese.

823
00:40:20,811 --> 00:40:22,945
She didn't find
anything. I'm sorry.

824
00:40:22,947 --> 00:40:25,581
I've got to get
to city hall.

825
00:40:25,583 --> 00:40:27,316
What are you
gonna do?

826
00:40:47,338 --> 00:40:49,305
Wire the money.
