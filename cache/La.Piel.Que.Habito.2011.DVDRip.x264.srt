1
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,686
THE SKIN I LIVE IN

2
00:02:39,198 --> 00:02:41,485
Help me with the dumbwaiter.

3
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,023
Open it.

4
00:02:48,157 --> 00:02:49,401
Take this.

5
00:03:14,323 --> 00:03:16,065
Marilia, are you there?

6
00:03:19,948 --> 00:03:21,062
Yes.

7
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,108
Send up more sackcloth
and double-sided tape.

8
00:03:24,948 --> 00:03:27,402
I can't get it until tomorrow.

9
00:03:28,032 --> 00:03:29,608
Okay.

10
00:03:31,323 --> 00:03:36,064
I also wanted a needle,
thread and scissors.

11
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,527
You're joking, right?

12
00:03:39,448 --> 00:03:41,155
Yeah.

13
00:04:19,323 --> 00:04:21,646
Our face identifies us.

14
00:04:21,782 --> 00:04:25,147
For burn victims,
saving their lives is not enough.

15
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:30,739
They need to have a face
even if it's from a corpse.

16
00:04:31,115 --> 00:04:32,110
A face with features...

17
00:04:32,198 --> 00:04:34,947
so they can gesticulate.

18
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,566
I have participated in

19
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,145
three out of the nine
face transplants

20
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,771
carried out in the world...

21
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:46,313
and they were the most moving
experiences of my life.

22
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,770
Good...

23
00:04:49,865 --> 00:04:52,436
For a shapeless mass to acquire
features that give it expression...

24
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:56,152
we have to mold the muscles...

25
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:02,355
articulating the facial musculature
with the corresponding nerve endings.

26
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,196
MATERNITY HOSPITAL

27
00:08:49,365 --> 00:08:53,027
Vera, I've brought you some opium.

28
00:09:03,532 --> 00:09:05,024
OPERATING THEATER

29
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,110
Can you breathe more gently?

30
00:09:29,782 --> 00:09:32,187
If you want me
to stop breathing, kill me.

31
00:09:32,282 --> 00:09:33,940
Don't talk nonsense.

32
00:09:36,948 --> 00:09:39,235
How long will all this last?

33
00:09:39,448 --> 00:09:42,115
Your skin is softer than I thought.

34
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,610
If you don't end it, I will.

35
00:09:44,698 --> 00:09:46,985
If you'd wanted to kill yourself...

36
00:09:47,073 --> 00:09:49,230
you'd have tried to cut your jugular.

37
00:09:49,782 --> 00:09:51,405
In any case...

38
00:09:53,115 --> 00:09:55,817
I didn't know your skin was so soft.

39
00:10:04,198 --> 00:10:05,774
Here it is...

40
00:10:06,323 --> 00:10:08,610
taken from the animal
while it was still alive.

41
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,281
Thank you.

42
00:13:22,198 --> 00:13:25,031
Now there won't be any more burns.

43
00:13:26,782 --> 00:13:29,235
You said that a year ago.

44
00:13:30,157 --> 00:13:32,029
I was hasty.

45
00:13:39,115 --> 00:13:41,153
Tell me if it burns you.

46
00:13:45,365 --> 00:13:47,190
And now?

47
00:13:51,448 --> 00:13:53,155
Now!

48
00:13:53,282 --> 00:13:54,822
I have given the name "Gal"...

49
00:13:54,948 --> 00:13:57,235
to the artificial skin
I've been working on...

50
00:13:57,323 --> 00:13:58,354
in recent years.

51
00:13:58,448 --> 00:14:01,151
Tell me if the mosquito bites you.

52
00:14:01,282 --> 00:14:04,529
This skin is resistant
to every insect bite...

53
00:14:06,115 --> 00:14:08,153
...which means a natural barrier to

54
00:14:08,282 --> 00:14:11,612
...malaria, for example.

55
00:14:11,907 --> 00:14:15,770
Naturally, I've carried out
a rigorous quality control...

56
00:14:16,115 --> 00:14:18,734
on the tissues implanted in mammals...

57
00:14:18,823 --> 00:14:19,818
specifically, in athymic mice...

58
00:14:19,948 --> 00:14:21,904
and the results...

59
00:14:22,032 --> 00:14:26,772
...have been spectacular.

60
00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:28,690
This leads me to suppose

61
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,778
they would be equally positive...

62
00:14:30,865 --> 00:14:32,655
in human mammals.

63
00:14:34,532 --> 00:14:38,229
What does the name Gal mean?
Are they initials?

64
00:14:38,365 --> 00:14:39,941
That was my wife's name.

65
00:14:40,073 --> 00:14:42,278
She was burned to death in a car crash.

66
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:45,197
In you presentation you stated...

67
00:14:45,782 --> 00:14:50,273
that the skin is resistant to insect bites
and could prevent malaria.

68
00:14:50,407 --> 00:14:52,113
What makes you think that?

69
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:55,737
The artificial skin is much harder
than human skin...

70
00:14:55,865 --> 00:14:57,488
and it smells different.

71
00:14:57,615 --> 00:14:59,238
It's been proven that
the malaria mosquito...

72
00:14:59,323 --> 00:15:01,894
distinguishes human skin by the smell.

73
00:15:02,073 --> 00:15:04,562
Gal smells different and repels it.

74
00:15:04,698 --> 00:15:06,654
Let's see if we can get rid of him.

75
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,364
That isn't enough.

76
00:15:10,032 --> 00:15:12,567
How did you toughen the skin?

77
00:15:13,073 --> 00:15:14,649
Excuse me.

78
00:15:16,907 --> 00:15:18,944
Let's go somewhere quieter.

79
00:15:19,032 --> 00:15:21,485
There's only one way to toughen skin.

80
00:15:21,573 --> 00:15:23,363
By mutating it.

81
00:15:24,073 --> 00:15:25,649
Yes, that's what I did.

82
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,398
Transgenesis.

83
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,902
Yes.
I transferred genetic information...

84
00:15:32,657 --> 00:15:35,571
from a pig's cell to a human cell.

85
00:15:36,032 --> 00:15:37,359
A pig's cell?

86
00:15:37,448 --> 00:15:39,238
It's much stronger than ours.

87
00:15:39,323 --> 00:15:40,816
You're insane!

88
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,273
You know the application
of transgenetic therepy...

89
00:15:44,407 --> 00:15:45,947
in humans is completely forbidden!

90
00:15:46,073 --> 00:15:47,152
Yes, I do.

91
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,937
And, forgive me,
but it seems the ultimate paradox.

92
00:15:51,573 --> 00:15:54,109
We intervene in everything around us...

93
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,487
meat, clothes,
vegetables, fruit, everything!

94
00:15:57,573 --> 00:16:01,354
Why not use scientific advances
to improve our species?

95
00:16:01,407 --> 00:16:02,816
You know how many diseases...

96
00:16:02,907 --> 00:16:04,897
we could cure with transgenesis?

97
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:07,360
Or the genetic malformations
that could be avoided?

98
00:16:07,407 --> 00:16:08,864
Don't go on!

99
00:16:08,948 --> 00:16:11,069
I know the list by heart...

100
00:16:11,407 --> 00:16:14,026
and I think of it every day.

101
00:16:15,115 --> 00:16:16,312
But even so...

102
00:16:16,407 --> 00:16:19,772
I must forbid you from
investigating further...

103
00:16:19,907 --> 00:16:21,897
or I'll be forced to report you...

104
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:23,571
to the scientific community.

105
00:16:23,657 --> 00:16:25,612
Over and above what you or I may think...

106
00:16:25,698 --> 00:16:29,692
the bioethics are
absolutely clear about this.

107
00:16:29,782 --> 00:16:35,067
Don't worry.
Gal was a personal adventure.

108
00:16:35,365 --> 00:16:37,652
I did it in memory of my wife...

109
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,442
and solely to extend my knowledge.

110
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:41,480
I remember...

111
00:16:41,573 --> 00:16:44,488
the first time
you told me about this experiment.

112
00:16:44,615 --> 00:16:46,855
It seemed like a dream then.

113
00:16:47,282 --> 00:16:48,774
And it still is.

114
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:52,272
The president has ordered me
to give it up, indefinitely.

115
00:16:52,615 --> 00:16:54,653
Shit, and it'll be the business
of the century.

116
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:58,604
It will be,
but we won't benefit from it.

117
00:17:00,876 --> 00:17:03,446
If you give up research,
will you go back to surgery?

118
00:17:03,573 --> 00:17:06,322
Your patients will be delighted.

119
00:17:06,865 --> 00:17:09,021
I don't know.

120
00:17:09,157 --> 00:17:12,190
We've got a waiting list
for operations in "El Cigarral".

121
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:15,072
- I'm leaving.
- Wait, so am I.

122
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:11,687
Do you like what you see?

123
00:19:13,115 --> 00:19:15,236
What do you mean?

124
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,442
Is there anything you want to improve?

125
00:19:23,615 --> 00:19:26,234
I don't want to improve anything.

126
00:19:27,448 --> 00:19:30,281
Can I take it I'm finished?

127
00:19:31,323 --> 00:19:32,982
Yes...

128
00:19:33,365 --> 00:19:36,695
and you can boast of having
the best skin in the world.

129
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:45,022
And now what?

130
00:19:45,573 --> 00:19:48,240
Now I'm going to light
this opium pipe...

131
00:19:48,323 --> 00:19:50,195
and smoke it.

132
00:19:50,615 --> 00:19:52,487
I mean us.

133
00:19:53,365 --> 00:19:54,941
Me.

134
00:19:55,032 --> 00:19:58,148
What are you going to do with me?

135
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,439
I don't know.
I'll think about it.

136
00:20:01,532 --> 00:20:02,645
When?

137
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,276
If you keep on, I'm leaving!

138
00:20:05,907 --> 00:20:08,905
Couldn't we just live?

139
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:12,528
Live together.

140
00:20:12,865 --> 00:20:14,903
Live together?

141
00:20:15,365 --> 00:20:18,280
- How?
- Like everyone.

142
00:20:19,865 --> 00:20:22,532
You and I aren't like everyone.

143
00:20:24,407 --> 00:20:26,777
Look on it as another
of your experiments.

144
00:20:26,823 --> 00:20:28,233
Living together as equals.

145
00:20:28,323 --> 00:20:31,156
That's it!

146
00:20:38,865 --> 00:20:40,322
Here.

147
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,443
I could set fire
to the house with this.

148
00:20:49,698 --> 00:20:51,405
I'm yours.

149
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,730
I'm made to measure for you.

150
00:20:55,365 --> 00:20:58,149
And you've just told me
that you like me.

151
00:20:58,573 --> 00:21:00,398
Did I say that?

152
00:21:02,865 --> 00:21:05,235
I know you look at me.

153
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:08,607
Since you brought me here,

154
00:21:08,657 --> 00:21:11,406
we practically live in the same room.

155
00:21:17,657 --> 00:21:19,233
In this pocket.

156
00:21:55,532 --> 00:22:02,649
Carnival celebrations
are being held on the Gran Via.

157
00:22:09,523 --> 00:22:12,059
You shouldn't have used her face.

158
00:22:12,398 --> 00:22:15,645
If I'd been here,
I'd have warned you of the danger.

159
00:22:15,982 --> 00:22:18,268
There's a resemblance,
but she isn't the same.

160
00:22:18,357 --> 00:22:20,431
The resemblance is too strong.

161
00:22:21,023 --> 00:22:23,310
Have you thought
what to do with her?

162
00:22:24,857 --> 00:22:29,016
You'll have to kill her
or keep her hidden here forever.

163
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:33,099
Why all the hurry to get rid of her?

164
00:22:33,398 --> 00:22:36,432
If you don't kill her,
she'll kill herself.

165
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:38,930
Stories repeat themselves.

166
00:22:40,232 --> 00:22:41,938
No! Not this one!

167
00:22:42,482 --> 00:22:46,013
Vera is stronger, a born survivor.

168
00:22:46,357 --> 00:22:48,347
You're sick.

169
00:22:48,648 --> 00:22:50,022
If you don't get rid of her...

170
00:22:50,107 --> 00:22:53,270
what you feel now will end up
devouring you, like a cancer.

171
00:22:54,023 --> 00:22:56,726
When you realize, it'll be too late.

172
00:22:58,232 --> 00:23:01,893
How are you so sure of what I feel
if even I don't know?

173
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:06,230
Because I know you as if I'd borne you.

174
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,107
Fire the servants
and don't hire anyone.

175
00:23:45,815 --> 00:23:47,605
What do you want?

176
00:23:47,982 --> 00:23:51,679
To see my mother.
I haven't seen her for ten years.

177
00:23:51,898 --> 00:23:53,012
If she was a servant...

178
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:55,435
they've just left and won't be back.

179
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:59,392
I saw them,
but she wasn't one of them.

180
00:23:59,565 --> 00:24:01,141
My mother is prettier.

181
00:24:01,232 --> 00:24:03,187
Go away or I'll call the police.

182
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,515
Zeca!

183
00:24:20,023 --> 00:24:23,021
I'm your son, Zeca.

184
00:24:23,148 --> 00:24:24,890
How dare you come here!

185
00:24:25,023 --> 00:24:26,433
Open the door!

186
00:24:26,523 --> 00:24:32,271
It's Carnival. We're both far
from Bahia and I'm homesick.

187
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:37,098
Look! Like the costume I wore
when I was little. Remember?

188
00:24:40,273 --> 00:24:41,980
Little tiger!

189
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:44,477
I just want to see you for a minute.

190
00:24:44,648 --> 00:24:47,397
Very well, but then you leave.

191
00:24:47,815 --> 00:24:49,391
Whatever you say.

192
00:24:49,523 --> 00:24:54,097
Follow the path and keep going
through the second gate.

193
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:20,564
How did you find us?

194
00:25:20,648 --> 00:25:24,772
I've been in Spain a while.
I saw Robert in the paper.

195
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,682
He was giving a...

196
00:25:28,523 --> 00:25:30,099
I don't know,
something in Madrid.

197
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:32,097
I went there
and then followed him here.

198
00:25:32,148 --> 00:25:33,227
Can't I come in?

199
00:25:33,273 --> 00:25:36,604
No, I'm not allowed visitors.

200
00:25:37,107 --> 00:25:39,809
It smells good.
I'm hungary.

201
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:43,231
Brute!

202
00:25:52,607 --> 00:25:54,562
The main new items today...

203
00:25:54,648 --> 00:25:57,397
are the Carnival celebrations...

204
00:25:57,523 --> 00:26:00,687
and the daring robbery commited
in the Bvlgari jewelry store...

205
00:26:00,732 --> 00:26:02,722
in the heart of Madrid.

206
00:26:02,857 --> 00:26:04,136
It happened last night...

207
00:26:04,273 --> 00:26:06,727
and today we have the first images
recorded by one...

208
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:12,971
of the twenty-four security cameras
which protect the jewelry store.

209
00:26:14,232 --> 00:26:16,555
Apart from the thief,
who appears in the image...

210
00:26:16,607 --> 00:26:20,138
police are looking
for one of the store's employees...

211
00:26:20,232 --> 00:26:24,226
who has been missing
for the last twenty-four hours.

212
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:27,605
As if they were going to find him!

213
00:26:28,565 --> 00:26:30,852
The bastard just had to
turn off the cameras...

214
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:33,263
but he changed his mind
and left one working.

215
00:26:33,398 --> 00:26:35,934
He'll be rotting in hell now.

216
00:26:36,107 --> 00:26:37,896
And the police are looking for you.

217
00:26:37,982 --> 00:26:41,892
Sure. If it weren't Carnival,
I couldn't go out.

218
00:26:42,273 --> 00:26:44,264
You can hide me here for a few days.

219
00:26:44,357 --> 00:26:45,814
Hide you here?

220
00:26:45,857 --> 00:26:46,970
Not a chance.

221
00:26:47,232 --> 00:26:49,934
We've got loads of patients.
A lot of people come here.

222
00:26:50,023 --> 00:26:52,014
I know how to hide.

223
00:26:52,148 --> 00:26:55,680
Anyway, I want Robert
to operate on my face.

224
00:26:55,815 --> 00:26:57,521
Robert?

225
00:26:57,565 --> 00:26:59,639
When he gets you on the table...

226
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:02,807
he'll give you a lethal injection!

227
00:27:03,107 --> 00:27:05,439
How could you think
he'd operate on you...

228
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,897
after what you did?

229
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:09,096
I'll have to blackmail him.

230
00:27:11,815 --> 00:27:15,097
If I kidnap you,
could I make him do it?

231
00:27:16,023 --> 00:27:18,512
You're raving mad.

232
00:27:18,898 --> 00:27:21,352
I'm just a servant.

233
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:24,522
Anyway, Robert's out of Spain.

234
00:27:25,857 --> 00:27:27,433
Even better.

235
00:27:27,848 --> 00:27:30,302
I'll stay here 'til he comes back.

236
00:27:34,182 --> 00:27:35,556
Where are you going?

237
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,093
- What do you want
- A drink.

238
00:27:40,723 --> 00:27:44,054
Take the bottle,
take what you want, just get out!

239
00:28:10,307 --> 00:28:11,504
What's this?

240
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,181
It's a film!

241
00:28:13,557 --> 00:28:15,049
Go away!

242
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,504
- She reminds me of...
- She doesn't remind you of anybody!

243
00:28:43,223 --> 00:28:44,799
Get out or I'll shoot.

244
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,514
Mom...

245
00:28:48,182 --> 00:28:51,049
you wouldn't do that to your son.

246
00:28:51,848 --> 00:28:55,677
You're not my son.
I just gave birth to you.

247
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:58,843
- It's her.
- It's not her!

248
00:28:58,932 --> 00:29:00,472
How could it be her?

249
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:02,548
Get out of here!

250
00:29:02,682 --> 00:29:04,091
Keep away!

251
00:29:13,932 --> 00:29:16,420
I heard a noise, like a shot.

252
00:29:16,973 --> 00:29:18,466
Is anything wrong?

253
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:20,512
I heard voices too.

254
00:29:47,765 --> 00:29:49,306
There.

255
00:31:17,682 --> 00:31:18,594
Who is it?

256
00:31:18,723 --> 00:31:20,679
It's me, Zeca. Open the door.

257
00:31:21,223 --> 00:31:22,597
I can't.

258
00:31:22,723 --> 00:31:25,638
- Why not?
- I haven't got the key.

259
00:31:26,348 --> 00:31:27,971
Does Marilia have it?

260
00:31:28,223 --> 00:31:30,510
- I don't know.
- What are you doing here?

261
00:31:53,348 --> 00:31:55,754
If you scream, I'll break your jaw.

262
00:32:03,973 --> 00:32:06,178
Where's the key to upstairs?

263
00:32:07,182 --> 00:32:09,303
In the drawer at the corner.

264
00:32:09,807 --> 00:32:11,632
Untie me and I'll give it to you.

265
00:32:11,682 --> 00:32:13,388
No, where is it?

266
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:17,802
In that drawer, in an envelope.

267
00:32:24,265 --> 00:32:26,552
- It's not here!
- At the back!

268
00:32:32,098 --> 00:32:33,923
There's just an envelope
that says "clips".

269
00:32:34,057 --> 00:32:38,003
- That's to fool people, idiot!
- Look inside.

270
00:32:44,057 --> 00:32:48,003
No. Not the napkin. No, no, no!

271
00:32:48,098 --> 00:32:50,587
- Yes, or else you'll scream.
- No, untie me, please!

272
00:32:50,723 --> 00:32:52,051
Open your mouth!

273
00:32:53,723 --> 00:32:57,669
Open it wider, mom!

274
00:32:58,848 --> 00:33:01,384
It all fit before.

275
00:33:47,973 --> 00:33:49,680
Did Robert send you?

277
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:55,636
How did you survive?
I left you burning like a torch.

278
00:33:59,598 --> 00:34:02,431
He saved me.

279
00:34:03,973 --> 00:34:06,047
Get me out of here!

280
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:08,178
I'll go anywhere with you!

281
00:34:09,682 --> 00:34:11,471
You're saying that...

282
00:34:11,557 --> 00:34:13,298
because I'm on top of you.

284
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:19,755
Ask me for anything!

285
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:22,805
What can you give me,
apart from a great fuck?

286
00:34:22,932 --> 00:34:25,503
I don't know. Lots of things!

287
00:34:25,932 --> 00:34:27,555
I'll do whatever you want.

288
00:34:29,848 --> 00:34:31,886
You could help me with Robert.

289
00:34:32,015 --> 00:34:33,805
How do you get on with him now?

290
00:34:34,723 --> 00:34:36,264
Great.

291
00:34:37,098 --> 00:34:39,468
- Great?
- Yes.

292
00:34:39,932 --> 00:34:43,297
- And he still locks you in?
- You know what he's like!

293
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:44,847
Yes.

294
00:34:46,682 --> 00:34:48,921
I'll take you with me.

295
00:34:49,057 --> 00:34:51,012
That might soften his heart
and he'll fix my face.

296
00:34:52,098 --> 00:34:56,471
If you kidnap me,
you can ask him for anything!

297
00:34:58,057 --> 00:35:00,723
I'll kidnap you, but first we'll fuck.

298
00:35:05,765 --> 00:35:07,009
Listen...

299
00:35:07,765 --> 00:35:08,713
What?

300
00:35:08,807 --> 00:35:11,093
Let's fuck in the garden, please!

301
00:35:11,182 --> 00:35:15,092
The garden? Why?
I'm sick of screwing in the open air.

302
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:17,262
This tiger wants a bed.

303
00:35:23,973 --> 00:35:25,680
Don't you like it?

304
00:35:26,015 --> 00:35:27,472
You're hurting me.

305
00:35:28,182 --> 00:35:29,722
It's very big.

306
00:35:29,848 --> 00:35:32,597
It's like it always was.
It used to drive you crazy.

307
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,098
Yes...

308
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:36,765
and it still does.
It drives me crazy!

309
00:35:37,015 --> 00:35:41,589
Shut up! You're weird,
you're distracting me.

310
00:36:55,223 --> 00:36:56,882
Kill her!

311
00:36:58,057 --> 00:36:59,549
Kill them both!

312
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:32,387
As children,
they played killing each other.

313
00:37:33,598 --> 00:37:36,964
I knew that one day
they'd do it for real.

314
00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:41,178
The tiger and Robert?

315
00:37:41,807 --> 00:37:43,216
Yes.

316
00:37:43,932 --> 00:37:45,508
They're brothers...

317
00:37:46,515 --> 00:37:48,636
but they don't know it.

318
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:51,713
At least I've never told them.

319
00:37:53,765 --> 00:37:57,427
I had Zeca by a servant
who disappeared soon after.

320
00:37:58,515 --> 00:38:03,303
And Robert is the son of Mr. Ledgard.

321
00:38:03,682 --> 00:38:08,754
Their fathers were very different
but both were born insane.

322
00:38:11,057 --> 00:38:13,261
It's my fault.

323
00:38:19,723 --> 00:38:23,006
I've got insanity in my entrails.

324
00:38:23,557 --> 00:38:26,253
I served the Ledgards
since I was a child.

325
00:38:26,348 --> 00:38:28,635
Mrs. Ledgard was sterile...

326
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:33,797
and when my Robert was born,
they kept him...

327
00:38:35,682 --> 00:38:38,431
and said she'd given birth to him.

328
00:38:40,473 --> 00:38:44,135
But I was the one who looked after him
from the day he was born.

329
00:38:46,265 --> 00:38:49,133
Zeca spoke to me as if he knew me.

330
00:38:49,307 --> 00:38:53,466
He mistook you for Gal,
Robert's wife.

331
00:38:55,515 --> 00:38:59,260
Unlike Robert,
Zeca grew up far from me.

332
00:39:01,557 --> 00:39:05,218
When he was seven,
he started transporting drugs.

333
00:39:05,348 --> 00:39:09,389
I never saw him.
He grew up on the street.

334
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:19,012
About twelve years ago
Zeca came back to the house.

335
00:39:20,098 --> 00:39:23,013
He was on the run
and asked us for shelter.

336
00:39:24,515 --> 00:39:27,055
I hid him in an outhouse,
but Gal found him...

337
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:30,715
she took a fancy to him...

338
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:33,343
and they ended up
running away together.

339
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,093
Their car crashed,

340
00:39:38,765 --> 00:39:40,921
Zeca survived and ran away.

341
00:39:42,682 --> 00:39:44,589
But she...

342
00:39:47,557 --> 00:39:53,885
Robert found her, horribly burned,
but still with a flicker of life.

343
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:01,337
He snatched her back from death
at the last minute.

344
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:09,258
He worked day and night.
He did endless research.

345
00:40:09,682 --> 00:40:11,258
He didn't sleep.

346
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:17,965
He only rested when he sat
by the bed where she was lying...

347
00:40:18,098 --> 00:40:20,504
covered with gauzes.

348
00:40:21,473 --> 00:40:25,302
He was intoxicated
by the smell of burned flesh.

349
00:40:26,848 --> 00:40:29,681
After the accident,
we lived like vampires...

350
00:40:31,515 --> 00:40:34,715
in total darkness and with no mirrors.

351
00:40:37,265 --> 00:40:39,552
To everyone's surprise...

352
00:40:39,682 --> 00:40:42,680
after several endless months,
Gal started to improve.

353
00:40:44,765 --> 00:40:47,929
The things that a madman's love can do!

354
00:40:52,723 --> 00:40:54,880
One day...

355
00:40:56,432 --> 00:40:59,762
when she could finally stand unaided...

356
00:41:01,432 --> 00:41:05,011
Gal heard Norma's voice in the distance...

357
00:41:05,723 --> 00:41:09,420
singing a song that she had taught her.

358
00:41:11,765 --> 00:41:14,432
And she got emotional.

359
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:21,390
For the first time in many months,
she got emotional.

360
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,133
And it was...

361
00:41:24,973 --> 00:41:28,256
like feeling she was alive again.

362
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:07,807
When she opened the window...

363
00:42:09,348 --> 00:42:13,389
she suddenly saw her image
reflected in the glass.

364
00:42:21,348 --> 00:42:24,216
She didn't look human.

365
00:42:24,807 --> 00:42:27,212
She was a cinder.

366
00:42:31,973 --> 00:42:34,592
She gave a scream
that echoed through the house...

367
00:42:34,765 --> 00:42:36,921
and threw herself out the window.

368
00:42:49,515 --> 00:42:52,513
Years later, little Norma...

369
00:42:53,557 --> 00:42:56,590
went in search of her mother...

370
00:42:57,848 --> 00:43:01,759
along the same road
her mother had taken.

371
00:43:04,682 --> 00:43:06,838
Through the window.

372
00:43:46,473 --> 00:43:49,673
- What did you do with the body?
- I buried it well.

373
00:43:49,807 --> 00:43:51,299
Did you pray?

374
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:54,637
Yes.
Everything you told me.

375
00:43:59,848 --> 00:44:01,720
Shall we go inside?

376
00:44:40,307 --> 00:44:43,091
Do you mind if we leave it

377
00:44:43,182 --> 00:44:44,805
for tomorrow?

378
00:44:46,265 --> 00:44:49,263
The tiger really messed me up.

379
00:44:50,098 --> 00:44:51,923
As you wish.

380
00:44:55,807 --> 00:44:57,430
But hold me!

381
00:45:04,432 --> 00:45:06,920
Don't worry, I'll wait.

382
00:45:07,807 --> 00:45:10,674
I don't want you to feel uncomfortable.

383
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:12,681
Thank you!

384
00:45:28,182 --> 00:45:30,552
I'm falling asleep.

385
00:45:38,057 --> 00:45:40,094
Sleep, my love.

386
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:02,298
SIX YEARS EARLIER

387
00:46:34,515 --> 00:46:36,885
Thank you.
I owe this wedding to you.

388
00:46:36,973 --> 00:46:39,592
Don't exaggerate.
Nico adores you.

389
00:46:42,015 --> 00:46:44,634
Without your help, he'd adore me less.

390
00:46:44,765 --> 00:46:47,170
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

391
00:46:53,932 --> 00:46:56,799
Your daughter is getting on well
with my neices.

392
00:46:57,515 --> 00:46:59,257
She seems much better...

393
00:46:59,432 --> 00:47:02,134
At least she isn't afraid of people now.

394
00:47:02,723 --> 00:47:05,840
Yes, it's odd she hasn't come
to ask if we can leave.

395
00:47:05,932 --> 00:47:09,262
She's great!
And she's having a wonderful time.

396
00:47:23,182 --> 00:47:24,674
To you!

397
00:48:16,098 --> 00:48:18,634
You've had him long enough,
it's my turn.

398
00:48:18,682 --> 00:48:20,305
Enjoy him, darling.

399
00:48:32,848 --> 00:48:34,258
Excuse me.

400
00:50:43,598 --> 00:50:45,257
Norma!

401
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:46,931
Norma!

402
00:50:47,348 --> 00:50:49,090
Norma!

403
00:50:49,307 --> 00:50:50,930
Norma!

404
00:50:51,098 --> 00:50:52,674
Norma!

405
00:50:52,890 --> 00:50:56,338
Sweetheart, it's me!

406
00:51:01,265 --> 00:51:03,754
There, there!

407
00:52:11,848 --> 00:52:13,045
What about this one?

408
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:14,337
Yes, but...

409
00:52:14,432 --> 00:52:15,593
no.

410
00:52:15,723 --> 00:52:16,837
And it looks a bit old.

411
00:52:16,932 --> 00:52:19,136
It's not old, it's vintage.

412
00:52:19,223 --> 00:52:21,677
- Maybe something flowery?
- No, no flowers.

413
00:52:21,765 --> 00:52:24,254
No flowers.
Something like this?

414
00:52:24,390 --> 00:52:25,883
Not stripes either.

415
00:52:26,015 --> 00:52:27,389
No stripes.

416
00:52:38,598 --> 00:52:40,139
Something graphic?

417
00:52:40,265 --> 00:52:42,884
Graphic?
Like this?

418
00:52:42,932 --> 00:52:44,887
I'll come back another day.

419
00:52:44,973 --> 00:52:48,090
Yes, do that, you're dopey today.

420
00:52:51,973 --> 00:52:53,135
Cristina...

421
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:56,131
Here. On the house.

422
00:52:56,223 --> 00:52:58,131
Put it on and we'll go partying.

423
00:52:58,265 --> 00:52:59,806
I'm meeting my girlfriend.

424
00:52:59,973 --> 00:53:02,544
Put it on anyway.
I'd like to see you in it.

425
00:53:04,182 --> 00:53:06,256
It'll look great on you.

426
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:08,381
If you like it so much, wear it yourself.

427
00:53:09,515 --> 00:53:11,221
You're so mistaken!

428
00:53:11,307 --> 00:53:13,214
Because I don't like men?

429
00:53:13,473 --> 00:53:15,594
Because you don't like me.

430
00:53:16,265 --> 00:53:17,841
In any case...

431
00:53:18,307 --> 00:53:21,672
I've got pills to get you in the mood.

432
00:53:21,807 --> 00:53:23,844
You shouldn't take that shit.

433
00:53:27,015 --> 00:53:29,089
Vicente, leave Cristina alone!

434
00:53:29,890 --> 00:53:31,431
I'm off.

435
00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:33,264
Where to?

436
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:34,764
Home, to get changed.

437
00:53:34,848 --> 00:53:36,092
How come?

438
00:53:36,682 --> 00:53:37,712
I'm meeting my pals.

439
00:53:37,807 --> 00:53:40,342
I think we're going to Casilda's party.

440
00:53:40,557 --> 00:53:41,587
Were you invited?

441
00:53:41,682 --> 00:53:43,756
Jorge knows one of the neices.

442
00:53:43,848 --> 00:53:45,590
We're just going to the dance.

443
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:48,879
Well? Are you coming?

444
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:51,296
Leave her alone, you pain.

445
00:53:53,223 --> 00:53:54,551
Good afternoon.

446
00:53:54,723 --> 00:53:56,181
Hello.

447
00:53:57,515 --> 00:53:59,636
My wife has left us...

448
00:53:59,723 --> 00:54:02,259
and I was wondering
if you'd want her clothes.

449
00:54:03,098 --> 00:54:05,303
- Josefina?
- Yes.

450
00:54:06,848 --> 00:54:08,222
Well...

451
00:54:08,432 --> 00:54:10,636
we don't have anything for fat women...

452
00:54:12,182 --> 00:54:16,846
If you're interested,
I'll let you check them out.

453
00:54:16,932 --> 00:54:18,590
They're very nice.

454
00:54:18,932 --> 00:54:20,922
We'll look at them and let you know.

455
00:54:21,057 --> 00:54:24,636
- Of course.
- It's this, right?

456
00:54:24,682 --> 00:54:25,630
Yes.
It's heavy.

457
00:54:25,723 --> 00:54:27,133
It certainly is.

458
00:54:27,223 --> 00:54:28,597
But...

459
00:54:29,015 --> 00:54:31,302
did she leave or has she disappeared?

460
00:54:31,515 --> 00:54:33,470
Both things.
To be honest...

461
00:54:33,557 --> 00:54:36,555
she does it regularly.
We're used to it.

462
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,346
So the next time she does it...

463
00:54:38,432 --> 00:54:41,513
she'll have to leave naked
because I'm selling her clothes.

464
00:55:27,723 --> 00:55:30,212
I'll show you the garden.

465
00:55:30,307 --> 00:55:33,056
What a party!

466
00:55:33,182 --> 00:55:34,639
Fresh air!

467
00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:39,423
You're all stoners!

468
00:55:42,598 --> 00:55:44,305
I'm Vicente.

469
00:55:45,182 --> 00:55:46,758
I'm Norma.

470
00:55:50,890 --> 00:55:52,680
Your friends have gone.

471
00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:56,177
All the better, right?

472
00:56:09,348 --> 00:56:10,841
Are you stoned?

473
00:56:11,557 --> 00:56:12,966
Stoned?

474
00:56:13,473 --> 00:56:15,429
Have you taken any pills?

475
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:17,930
Yes.

476
00:56:18,557 --> 00:56:20,547
Cipralex 20...

477
00:56:21,515 --> 00:56:24,347
100mg of Deprax...

478
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:27,714
2g of Trankimazin.

479
00:56:27,807 --> 00:56:29,465
I don't take Rohipnol now.

480
00:56:29,848 --> 00:56:32,302
And Lyrica, of course.

481
00:56:32,432 --> 00:56:33,711
Shit!

482
00:56:33,848 --> 00:56:35,804
I'm high as hell too.

483
00:56:35,932 --> 00:56:37,259
High?

484
00:56:37,723 --> 00:56:39,133
Yes.

485
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:46,047
You're not from here, are you?

486
00:56:46,182 --> 00:56:48,256
No. Are you?

487
00:56:48,557 --> 00:56:51,176
Yes, but I want to get away...

488
00:57:10,223 --> 00:57:13,008
I'm sick of these high heels!

489
00:57:18,932 --> 00:57:20,508
And this jacket!

490
00:57:22,015 --> 00:57:25,926
All these clothes give me claustrophobia.

491
00:57:26,348 --> 00:57:30,129
If I could, I'd go naked all the time.

492
00:57:32,390 --> 00:57:33,669
Wait.

493
00:57:34,682 --> 00:57:36,388
I'll leave you naked.

494
00:58:16,682 --> 00:58:18,423
You're so pretty...

495
00:58:20,307 --> 00:58:21,847
and different.

496
00:58:24,015 --> 00:58:25,721
I'm different too.

497
00:58:26,098 --> 00:58:28,172
Are you in treatment too?

498
00:58:29,973 --> 00:58:31,052
No.

499
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:33,178
Do you think I should be?

500
00:58:33,265 --> 00:58:34,674
I don't know.

501
00:58:35,348 --> 00:58:38,880
And now, on the groom's request,
I'm going to sing...

502
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:40,384
"I Need To Love"

503
00:58:40,473 --> 00:58:42,429
This is also for the bride...

504
00:58:42,557 --> 00:58:44,298
with all my affection.

506
00:59:53,973 --> 00:59:56,011
Shut up!

507
00:59:58,473 --> 01:00:00,630
Stop!

508
01:01:35,932 --> 01:01:37,472
Cristina...

509
01:01:37,598 --> 01:01:40,845
If I left, you'd stay here
with my mother, wouldn't you?

510
01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:42,514
Yes...

511
01:01:42,598 --> 01:01:44,388
but where are you going?

512
01:01:44,473 --> 01:01:47,424
I don't know.
I'm sick of the town.

513
01:01:47,598 --> 01:01:49,174
That's because of all the stuff you take.

514
01:01:49,223 --> 01:01:50,716
I haven't taken anything in a week.

515
01:01:50,807 --> 01:01:52,430
Then it's because of that.

516
01:01:53,182 --> 01:01:55,303
So should I take it or not?

517
01:01:55,348 --> 01:01:56,889
It's best not to.

518
01:01:58,807 --> 01:02:00,347
I'm going out.

519
01:02:00,807 --> 01:02:02,714
Now? Without finishing it?

520
01:02:02,765 --> 01:02:03,713
Yes.

521
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:09,008
Are you coming for supper
or will you be late?

522
01:02:09,098 --> 01:02:11,801
I'll be home for supper,
I just need some air.

523
01:02:11,848 --> 01:02:14,882
Leave it mom, I can do it.
Pass me my helmet.

524
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:18,178
Are you leaving that mess?

525
01:02:18,223 --> 01:02:20,677
I'll finish it tomorrow.

526
01:03:15,057 --> 01:03:18,257
What are you doing, asshole?
Are you crazy?

527
01:03:59,182 --> 01:04:00,805
Son of a bitch!

528
01:04:01,723 --> 01:04:04,129
Bastard!

529
01:04:12,307 --> 01:04:13,847
Are you crazy?

530
01:04:14,098 --> 01:04:17,262
Don't shoot!

531
01:06:13,807 --> 01:06:15,928
Help!

532
01:06:20,098 --> 01:06:21,591
Help!

533
01:06:33,932 --> 01:06:35,341
Come in.

534
01:06:37,307 --> 01:06:38,634
Sit down, please.

535
01:06:40,598 --> 01:06:42,008
Thank you.

536
01:06:44,057 --> 01:06:46,047
I was told there's news.

537
01:06:47,223 --> 01:06:51,632
We found the bike, totally destroyed,
at the Finisterre cliffs.

538
01:06:53,307 --> 01:06:54,883
And the body?

539
01:06:55,307 --> 01:06:56,634
Nothing.

540
01:06:57,140 --> 01:06:59,296
It must have been washed out to sea.

541
01:07:03,890 --> 01:07:05,680
We're very sorry, ma'am.

542
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:08,596
My son is alive.

543
01:07:10,265 --> 01:07:13,429
- As we said...
- Yes, you found the bike...

544
01:07:13,473 --> 01:07:15,096
but my son?

545
01:07:16,598 --> 01:07:19,087
He could have been kidnapped.

546
01:07:21,765 --> 01:07:25,131
Until his body appears,
you must keep looking, please!

547
01:07:25,223 --> 01:07:27,179
We've talked about this already, ma'am.

548
01:07:27,265 --> 01:07:31,306
You have to keep looking.
My son is alive!

549
01:07:31,390 --> 01:07:33,961
If he is, he's far away.

550
01:07:36,140 --> 01:07:39,340
All his friends that were questioned,
even your assistant...

551
01:07:39,432 --> 01:07:42,632
all say he was fed up and wanted to leave.

552
01:07:42,682 --> 01:07:44,423
But he said he'd be home for supper.

553
01:07:44,473 --> 01:07:45,801
Cristina heard him.

554
01:07:45,973 --> 01:07:49,421
If he didn't call me,
it's because something happened.

555
01:08:06,723 --> 01:08:08,679
NEUROPSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE

556
01:08:23,307 --> 01:08:27,004
It's me, Norma.
It's dad.

557
01:08:30,057 --> 01:08:32,131
Norma...

558
01:08:34,015 --> 01:08:35,045
Sweetheart...

559
01:08:35,098 --> 01:08:36,342
Sweetheart...

560
01:08:36,432 --> 01:08:39,383
I won't touch you.

561
01:08:41,682 --> 01:08:43,258
Where are you going?

562
01:08:50,182 --> 01:08:51,888
Where are you going?

563
01:08:59,848 --> 01:09:01,922
Norma, love.

564
01:09:06,432 --> 01:09:07,510
Everything okay?

565
01:09:07,557 --> 01:09:09,962
Yes.

566
01:09:14,598 --> 01:09:16,340
It's me, Norma.

567
01:09:16,432 --> 01:09:18,755
You can come out,
the men have gone.

568
01:09:18,890 --> 01:09:22,931
Can't you put her in a dress?
In that gown she looks worse than she is.

569
01:09:23,015 --> 01:09:24,508
We tried...

570
01:09:25,057 --> 01:09:28,173
but she can't stand
any kind of fitted clothing.

571
01:09:28,265 --> 01:09:29,923
She rips it off.

572
01:09:31,723 --> 01:09:35,799
Dr. Ledgard, I don't think
you should visit her so often.

573
01:09:36,932 --> 01:09:40,214
- She's my daughter!
- But she doesn't recognize you.

574
01:09:40,390 --> 01:09:42,464
And she gets worse when she sees you.

575
01:09:42,557 --> 01:09:45,590
In her mind,
she's convinced you attacked her.

576
01:09:45,723 --> 01:09:47,097
I just found her lying there!

577
01:09:47,182 --> 01:09:49,552
Why can't you get that into her head?

578
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:52,389
She identifies you with the rapist.

579
01:09:53,473 --> 01:09:54,753
Maybe...

580
01:09:54,848 --> 01:09:57,716
we let her out too soon.

581
01:09:57,890 --> 01:10:00,509
It was your idea
that she should socialize.

582
01:10:00,557 --> 01:10:03,176
She was getting over her social phobia.

583
01:10:03,307 --> 01:10:04,337
How could I know...

584
01:10:04,390 --> 01:10:07,341
someone would try to
rape her while she was with you.

585
01:11:33,348 --> 01:11:38,219
Over here!
Please! Get me out of here!

586
01:11:38,307 --> 01:11:41,221
Help!
Get me out of here!

587
01:11:42,390 --> 01:11:45,969
I'm thirsty and I'm starving.

588
01:11:46,390 --> 01:11:48,180
You'll eat and drink now.

589
01:11:48,265 --> 01:11:51,382
I haven't done anything!
This is a mistake!

590
01:11:51,515 --> 01:11:54,596
Possibly.
Everyone makes mistakes.

591
01:11:55,557 --> 01:11:58,341
Come over here, you bastard,
and set me free!

592
01:12:09,765 --> 01:12:11,139
Turn around!

593
01:12:42,098 --> 01:12:44,634
I'm chaining you nearer to the table.

594
01:12:44,765 --> 01:12:48,047
But, why?
I haven't done anything.

595
01:12:49,057 --> 01:12:51,178
You'll be more comfortable there.

596
01:13:28,432 --> 01:13:29,924
Eat.

597
01:13:31,348 --> 01:13:32,758
Thank you!

598
01:13:38,765 --> 01:13:41,005
Sorry if I annoyed you the other day.

599
01:13:41,848 --> 01:13:44,302
I've been alone for so long.

600
01:13:47,182 --> 01:13:50,382
Wait, please! Don't go!

601
01:13:54,432 --> 01:13:56,588
Please, don't go!

602
01:13:56,765 --> 01:13:58,803
We have to talk.

603
01:14:26,765 --> 01:14:28,222
My condolences.

604
01:14:31,723 --> 01:14:33,714
We did what we could.

605
01:14:34,015 --> 01:14:36,504
It wasn't enough
and you did it very badly.

606
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:38,512
I'm going to report the hospital,
and you in particular...

607
01:14:38,598 --> 01:14:40,221
for homicidal negligence.

608
01:14:40,265 --> 01:14:43,014
- Please, this isn't the place.
- Please...

609
01:14:46,723 --> 01:14:48,548
You really want to work today?

610
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:49,802
Yes.

611
01:14:49,932 --> 01:14:53,048
You should rest and try to forget.

612
01:14:53,140 --> 01:14:56,221
I couldn't sleep, and working
will keep my mind occupied.

613
01:14:56,307 --> 01:14:58,795
- Call the whole team.
- Okay.

614
01:15:16,932 --> 01:15:18,922
My mother will be very worried.

615
01:15:19,682 --> 01:15:22,170
I never stay away without calling her.

616
01:15:32,098 --> 01:15:34,172
You have a daughter, haven't you?

617
01:15:40,265 --> 01:15:42,007
Why do you say that?

618
01:15:43,598 --> 01:15:45,506
The toys...

619
01:15:45,598 --> 01:15:47,340
My daughter is dead.

620
01:15:49,140 --> 01:15:51,711
We buried her today.

621
01:15:54,307 --> 01:15:56,214
I'm sorry.

622
01:16:05,307 --> 01:16:07,973
And now, some aftershave.

623
01:16:10,682 --> 01:16:12,719
Why did you shave me?

624
01:16:13,182 --> 01:16:15,172
That's a good question.

625
01:17:08,598 --> 01:17:09,593
Yes?

626
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:11,014
It's us.

627
01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:12,549
I'll let you in.

628
01:17:31,682 --> 01:17:33,258
If he says we're late,

629
01:17:33,307 --> 01:17:35,546
say there were two
accidents on the road

630
01:17:35,807 --> 01:17:37,679
You know how he is about punctuality.

631
01:17:41,140 --> 01:17:42,763
Good evening.

632
01:17:42,848 --> 01:17:44,176
You're late.

633
01:17:44,348 --> 01:17:46,173
There were two accidents on the road.

634
01:17:46,598 --> 01:17:49,265
Here's the paperwork and envelopes.

635
01:17:49,348 --> 01:17:51,671
When you're ready, we'll start.

636
01:17:52,182 --> 01:17:56,056
Two accidents, one near that town...

637
01:18:36,848 --> 01:18:40,344
He's very young.
He looks like a boy.

638
01:18:41,140 --> 01:18:42,846
He isn't.

639
01:18:43,598 --> 01:18:46,762
He's 27 and he knows
exactly what he wants.

640
01:18:46,890 --> 01:18:49,888
It's a particularly confidential case.

641
01:19:25,390 --> 01:19:27,345
What's happened?

642
01:19:31,973 --> 01:19:33,929
What did you do to me?

643
01:19:34,598 --> 01:19:36,838
A vaginoplasty

644
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:48,012
No...

645
01:20:34,890 --> 01:20:37,509
Listen carefully to what I'm going to say.

646
01:20:37,598 --> 01:20:39,221
It's very important.

647
01:20:41,557 --> 01:20:44,887
As you've just seen,
the operation was successful...

648
01:20:45,098 --> 01:20:49,839
but the tissues of the vagina are still
very tender and could stick together.

649
01:20:49,932 --> 01:20:53,095
But don't worry,
it's easy to prevent that.

650
01:20:53,348 --> 01:20:54,628
You...

651
01:20:55,932 --> 01:20:58,764
You have to keep the new orifice open...

652
01:20:58,848 --> 01:21:02,214
and manage, bit by bit, to make it deeper.

653
01:21:03,348 --> 01:21:07,970
Think that your life
depends on that orifice...

654
01:21:08,057 --> 01:21:10,427
that you breathe through it.

655
01:21:12,140 --> 01:21:13,514
In this case...

656
01:21:15,098 --> 01:21:18,298
there are several dilators
of different sizes.

657
01:21:20,807 --> 01:21:25,180
Start by inserting the smallest one.

658
01:21:27,515 --> 01:21:29,755
It will hurt at first...

659
01:21:30,598 --> 01:21:33,134
but in a few months...

660
01:21:33,265 --> 01:21:36,346
the largest one will fit
without any effort...

661
01:21:36,473 --> 01:21:38,180
and the skin...

662
01:21:38,348 --> 01:21:42,424
will be perfectly healed.

663
01:21:50,890 --> 01:21:54,505
This is very good.

664
01:21:56,307 --> 01:21:58,760
How long have you been using
the last dilator?

665
01:21:58,848 --> 01:22:00,507
Four weeks.

666
01:22:00,848 --> 01:22:02,389
Can I go now?

667
01:22:02,807 --> 01:22:05,378
- Go where?
- Home.

668
01:22:05,890 --> 01:22:07,845
But we've just started.

669
01:22:22,765 --> 01:22:24,720
What else are you going to do?

670
01:22:26,765 --> 01:22:29,384
You'll see, when the time comes.

671
01:22:31,557 --> 01:22:33,843
Why are you doing this?

672
01:22:41,723 --> 01:22:44,259
Do you remember
Casilda Efraiz's wedding?

673
01:22:45,432 --> 01:22:47,967
In that spectacular house?

674
01:22:49,348 --> 01:22:53,591
I'm Norma's father.
She was the child you raped.

675
01:22:55,182 --> 01:22:57,219
I don't think I actually raped her.

676
01:22:57,265 --> 01:23:01,590
You "don't think"?
Have you lost your memory?

677
01:23:02,557 --> 01:23:07,428
I'd taken a lot of pills
and I can hardly remember it.

678
01:23:07,473 --> 01:23:12,012
Well I didn't take anything
and I'll never forget it!

679
01:23:12,098 --> 01:23:13,888
What are you going to do now?

680
01:23:34,932 --> 01:23:38,712
It's a pity you can't see your whole body.

681
01:23:42,557 --> 01:23:46,005
They don't seem pneumatic now, do they?

682
01:23:46,098 --> 01:23:50,306
They're like drops of water
sliding along a glass surface.

683
01:23:59,140 --> 01:24:02,008
The marks on your skin will disappear.

684
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:05,093
There's still work to do.

685
01:24:06,182 --> 01:24:10,638
But to put you mind at ease,
there'll be no more burns.

686
01:24:13,390 --> 01:24:18,131
I've bought you this body stocking.
It'll protect your skin.

687
01:24:18,223 --> 01:24:21,554
It'll also give you support
and mold you.

688
01:24:22,223 --> 01:24:26,513
Get used to wearing it all the time...

689
01:24:27,807 --> 01:24:29,299
like a second skin.

690
01:24:30,723 --> 01:24:32,264
Put it on.

691
01:25:17,765 --> 01:25:20,052
Will you zip me up, please?

692
01:25:41,515 --> 01:25:42,842
Bitch!

693
01:26:31,473 --> 01:26:32,847
Stop!

694
01:26:34,140 --> 01:26:36,629
Give me the key
or I'll come up and stab you!

695
01:26:38,765 --> 01:26:40,471
Stay where you are!

696
01:26:56,348 --> 01:26:58,173
I'll slit my throat...

697
01:26:58,223 --> 01:27:00,297
and then you'll have no toy!

698
01:27:01,473 --> 01:27:03,215
You wouldn't dare.

699
01:27:38,223 --> 01:27:40,013
We were lucky.

700
01:27:41,765 --> 01:27:43,555
SEVERAL WEEKS LATER

701
01:28:27,473 --> 01:28:30,258
I can't keep calling you Vicente.

702
01:28:33,265 --> 01:28:37,590
From today, your name is Vera.

703
01:30:24,723 --> 01:30:27,129
I don't know if you're there.

704
01:30:27,223 --> 01:30:29,629
I'm returning the makeup book
and the makeup.

705
01:30:29,723 --> 01:30:31,382
Do what you want with them.

706
01:30:54,182 --> 01:30:56,753
...and you can practice it anywhere...

707
01:30:56,807 --> 01:30:59,674
on a hospital bed, in jail.

708
01:31:20,265 --> 01:31:23,465
There's a place where
you can take refuge...

709
01:31:23,932 --> 01:31:26,716
a place inside you...

710
01:31:26,807 --> 01:31:28,596
a place to which...

711
01:31:28,682 --> 01:31:31,005
no one else has access...

712
01:31:31,057 --> 01:31:33,723
a place that no one can destroy.

713
01:31:34,265 --> 01:31:36,552
To access that place there is yoga...

714
01:31:36,807 --> 01:31:39,721
an ancient technique.

715
01:31:40,598 --> 01:31:44,094
It's a place where you'll find peace,
where you'll find tranquility...

716
01:31:44,140 --> 01:31:45,763
freedom.

717
01:31:45,890 --> 01:31:47,596
But you must practice it...

718
01:31:47,682 --> 01:31:50,301
continuously, intensely...

719
01:31:50,390 --> 01:31:54,715
and then you'll achieve it.

720
01:31:55,182 --> 01:31:57,172
YOGA BOOKS

721
01:32:58,515 --> 01:33:00,422
My Cigarral!

722
01:33:01,265 --> 01:33:03,172
I missed it so much!

723
01:33:04,723 --> 01:33:07,426
These four years seemed eternal!

724
01:33:07,557 --> 01:33:11,254
- Was it that long?
- Four years and two months.

725
01:33:11,807 --> 01:33:14,473
I thought you'd forgotten me.

726
01:33:15,307 --> 01:33:17,013
I thought that...

727
01:33:17,182 --> 01:33:20,429
at least you'd have called me
when Norma died.

728
01:33:20,973 --> 01:33:23,130
My poor child.

729
01:33:23,390 --> 01:33:25,464
To throw herself out the window!

730
01:33:25,598 --> 01:33:28,004
I'd rather not talk about it.

731
01:33:28,682 --> 01:33:30,554
As you wish.

732
01:33:31,557 --> 01:33:33,962
But I'm going to miss her so much!

733
01:33:35,807 --> 01:33:37,762
Let's go to the kitchen.

734
01:33:38,182 --> 01:33:39,591
I'm parched.

735
01:33:43,640 --> 01:33:45,595
Don't look at the surfaces.

736
01:33:47,390 --> 01:33:49,713
Everything has to be cleaned.

737
01:33:49,932 --> 01:33:53,463
Call the agency
and hire the help you need.

738
01:33:53,807 --> 01:33:56,177
You've installed more televisions.

739
01:33:56,307 --> 01:34:00,596
They're not televisions.
It's to control a patient.

740
01:34:00,723 --> 01:34:02,513
I'll explain.

741
01:34:03,390 --> 01:34:05,879
From now on, you'll look after her.

742
01:34:05,973 --> 01:34:09,884
But you don't have to go into her room.
She cleans it.

743
01:34:11,890 --> 01:34:15,884
- Are there more patients
- No. She's the only one.

744
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:38,346
You've put on your uniform.

745
01:34:39,057 --> 01:34:41,510
You don't have to wear it.

746
01:34:41,557 --> 01:34:43,097
I like the uniform...

747
01:34:43,223 --> 01:34:45,842
because it means we're together again.

748
01:34:53,765 --> 01:34:55,258
Who is she?

749
01:34:56,515 --> 01:34:58,636
I told you.
Her name's Vera.

750
01:34:59,432 --> 01:35:01,173
What's she doing?

751
01:35:02,057 --> 01:35:03,763
She's writing on the wall.

752
01:35:03,890 --> 01:35:06,177
I can see that.

753
01:35:07,932 --> 01:35:09,757
It smells of croquettes.

754
01:35:12,182 --> 01:35:14,386
She called me on the intercom...

755
01:35:14,515 --> 01:35:17,299
and asked who I was and what day it was.

756
01:35:17,682 --> 01:35:20,633
When I told her
she started writing on the wall.

757
01:35:22,307 --> 01:35:25,258
I don't want her
to take liberties with you.

758
01:35:25,890 --> 01:35:30,215
Don't unlock her room.
If there's a problem, call me.

759
01:35:31,057 --> 01:35:33,343
She reminds me of someone.

760
01:35:33,473 --> 01:35:37,135
All the women I've operated on
end up reminding you of someone.

761
01:35:37,265 --> 01:35:41,472
Yes, but her more so.
The face is the same.

762
01:35:52,682 --> 01:35:56,130
I BREATHE.
I KNOW I BREATHE.

763
01:36:08,473 --> 01:36:11,176
OPIUM HELPS ME FORGET.

764
01:36:25,140 --> 01:36:27,380
BACK TO THE PRESENT

765
01:36:32,015 --> 01:36:34,799
- What are you doing?
- Slicing a pineapple.

766
01:36:37,098 --> 01:36:39,717
Don't look at me like that.
I won't hurt you.

767
01:36:39,848 --> 01:36:41,638
I don't trust you.

768
01:36:41,973 --> 01:36:45,173
If you did, it would be much easier
for the three of us.

769
01:36:46,473 --> 01:36:48,014
Pass me the tray.

770
01:36:48,098 --> 01:36:51,132
No. I'll take it up.

771
01:36:55,640 --> 01:36:58,129
Just put it in the dumbwaiter.

772
01:36:59,515 --> 01:37:01,008
Thank you.

773
01:38:03,557 --> 01:38:05,298
Good morning.

774
01:38:11,098 --> 01:38:12,805
Breakfast.

775
01:38:16,307 --> 01:38:18,096
Thank you.

776
01:38:28,015 --> 01:38:29,887
Where's Marilia?

777
01:38:30,057 --> 01:38:32,094
In the kitchen, grumbling.

778
01:38:33,140 --> 01:38:36,470
She doesn't like anyone else
looking after you.

779
01:38:46,973 --> 01:38:48,632
Last night...

780
01:38:49,473 --> 01:38:51,345
before we went to bed...

781
01:38:51,473 --> 01:38:54,388
we talked alot and we made a promise.

782
01:38:55,932 --> 01:38:59,214
- Or did I dream it?
- You didn't dream it.

783
01:39:01,182 --> 01:39:04,298
You promised me that
there'd be no more locked doors...

784
01:39:05,098 --> 01:39:07,717
that I could see all the TV channels...

785
01:39:08,890 --> 01:39:11,011
that I was free.

786
01:39:13,140 --> 01:39:16,173
And I promised you
that I'd never leave you.

787
01:39:17,432 --> 01:39:19,387
Don't let me down.

788
01:39:19,973 --> 01:39:22,427
It's all I have, Robert.

789
01:39:23,057 --> 01:39:25,296
Your promise and mine.

790
01:39:34,682 --> 01:39:37,431
Have you really thought
about what we're going to do?

791
01:39:38,557 --> 01:39:42,005
When we're in the streets
she could push me and run off.

792
01:39:42,098 --> 01:39:43,840
She promised not to.

793
01:39:43,932 --> 01:39:47,179
And you believe her?
You're like a child.

794
01:39:47,723 --> 01:39:51,552
You were always like that with women.
And look where it got you!

795
01:39:51,598 --> 01:39:53,174
That's enough!

796
01:39:56,223 --> 01:39:58,463
I'm sorry I took so long.

797
01:39:59,390 --> 01:40:02,388
I've put on high heels to practice.

798
01:40:02,848 --> 01:40:06,296
Buy whatever you like.
Marilia has the cards.

799
01:40:06,473 --> 01:40:08,049
Thank you.

800
01:40:24,057 --> 01:40:25,715
Come along, child!

801
01:40:32,182 --> 01:40:34,219
Have you a problem with me?

802
01:40:34,765 --> 01:40:38,047
No, but as you can see I'm very busy.

803
01:40:39,807 --> 01:40:43,172
I want to talk about the clinic.

804
01:40:43,390 --> 01:40:45,381
I told you on the phone.

805
01:40:46,265 --> 01:40:47,888
After talking to the president...

806
01:40:47,973 --> 01:40:51,469
I decided to stop using
the house as a clinic.

807
01:40:53,223 --> 01:40:56,138
But if things are done carefully,
there's no reason to worry.

808
01:40:56,223 --> 01:40:57,846
It's not just that.

809
01:40:58,140 --> 01:41:01,920
I've got other plans
that don't include operating.

810
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:07,219
If you don't want to operate,
we'll rent the clinic from you.

811
01:41:07,307 --> 01:41:10,139
I'm speaking for all the team.

812
01:41:10,265 --> 01:41:13,097
Our main patients love the isolation here.

813
01:41:13,140 --> 01:41:16,636
I said no, Fulgencio.

814
01:41:20,473 --> 01:41:23,009
And now I'd like to be alone.

815
01:41:24,140 --> 01:41:27,304
Forgive me for not seeing you out.
You know the way.

816
01:42:00,557 --> 01:42:02,547
Are you still here?

817
01:42:03,932 --> 01:42:05,176
I'm leaving now...

818
01:42:05,307 --> 01:42:08,968
but first I'd like you
to see today's paper.

819
01:42:13,265 --> 01:42:14,971
Vicente Guillen Pineiro.

820
01:42:15,098 --> 01:42:17,255
We gave him a sex change.

821
01:42:18,015 --> 01:42:21,630
He disappeared from his home
on September 10, 2006...

822
01:42:21,848 --> 01:42:22,962
as you can see.

823
01:42:23,098 --> 01:42:24,639
And?

824
01:42:25,348 --> 01:42:27,754
I was always surprised he wanted
to get a cunt...

825
01:42:28,015 --> 01:42:29,805
without hormones.

826
01:42:29,932 --> 01:42:31,922
He only wanted a cunt.

827
01:42:32,432 --> 01:42:35,844
He's much more muscular now
and he's working in L.A...

828
01:42:35,973 --> 01:42:39,469
in porn movies, and making a fortune.
What's this about?

829
01:42:43,848 --> 01:42:47,463
It says that his mother
is still searching desperately for him.

830
01:42:47,557 --> 01:42:49,713
Don't go there.

831
01:42:49,848 --> 01:42:52,254
Those documents you
gave us were all false.

832
01:42:52,682 --> 01:42:53,630
It wouldn't be the first time...

833
01:42:53,723 --> 01:42:56,472
we accepted false documents.

834
01:42:56,598 --> 01:42:59,217
Why do you think
our clients prefer this place?

835
01:42:59,265 --> 01:43:02,180
- You know what I think?
- No, and I don't care.

836
01:43:02,848 --> 01:43:06,889
I think you kidnapped him...

837
01:43:06,973 --> 01:43:09,213
and you've been experimenting
on him in every sense.

838
01:43:09,515 --> 01:43:10,629
You told us...

839
01:43:10,723 --> 01:43:13,342
you'd tested your new skin
on athymic mice.

840
01:43:13,432 --> 01:43:15,221
Knowing you as I do...

841
01:43:15,307 --> 01:43:18,637
I think you'd have no scruples
about testing it on a human being.

842
01:43:18,723 --> 01:43:20,595
On Vicente, for example.

843
01:43:20,932 --> 01:43:24,842
Do you know what would happen to you...

844
01:43:24,932 --> 01:43:26,887
if the scientific community
found out you used transgenesis...

845
01:43:26,973 --> 01:43:29,011
on someone you'd kidnapped?

846
01:43:29,057 --> 01:43:31,676
I don't like threats,
they end up infecting me.

847
01:43:34,015 --> 01:43:36,551
You don't know what you're talking about.

848
01:43:39,848 --> 01:43:42,716
Get the hell out of here!

849
01:43:44,182 --> 01:43:47,962
If you're talking about me,
Dr. Roberts didn't kidnap me.

850
01:43:51,348 --> 01:43:52,296
And...

851
01:43:52,390 --> 01:43:54,345
what's that transgenesis?

852
01:43:55,723 --> 01:43:57,465
A cream?

853
01:43:59,723 --> 01:44:02,390
If I'm here it's because
I came of my own will.

854
01:44:03,640 --> 01:44:07,504
And my name isn't Vicente,
it's Vera.

855
01:44:07,848 --> 01:44:09,471
Vera Cruz.

856
01:44:10,890 --> 01:44:13,426
And I was always a woman!

857
01:44:35,515 --> 01:44:37,091
Give me a cigarette.

858
01:44:46,765 --> 01:44:48,507
Thank you.

859
01:44:48,807 --> 01:44:51,591
No, I thank you.

860
01:45:18,515 --> 01:45:20,257
Does it still hurt?

861
01:45:20,390 --> 01:45:21,966
Yes.

862
01:45:24,057 --> 01:45:26,047
Shall we do it from behind?

863
01:45:27,265 --> 01:45:29,552
Wouldn't that hurt more?

864
01:45:30,348 --> 01:45:32,090
- Wait...
- What?

865
01:45:32,182 --> 01:45:34,338
Just today I bought lubricating cream.

866
01:45:34,390 --> 01:45:36,926
- Go and get it!
- It's in my purse.

867
01:45:51,932 --> 01:45:54,088
I'm sure I put it in my new purse...

868
01:45:54,223 --> 01:45:55,385
but I can't find it.

869
01:45:55,473 --> 01:45:58,044
You must have left it downstairs.

870
01:45:58,223 --> 01:46:01,340
I'll go and get it.

871
01:46:34,973 --> 01:46:38,220
Vera!
Hurry up!

872
01:46:50,390 --> 01:46:53,471
At last!
I thought you'd gone.

873
01:46:55,973 --> 01:46:57,466
Not yet.

874
01:47:03,390 --> 01:47:04,764
Come on...

875
01:47:06,598 --> 01:47:08,221
What are you doing?

876
01:47:10,848 --> 01:47:12,673
I'm going to kill you.

877
01:47:13,140 --> 01:47:14,798
This is a joke, right?

878
01:47:15,682 --> 01:47:17,423
Call it what you want.

879
01:47:18,932 --> 01:47:20,887
But you promised!

880
01:47:21,015 --> 01:47:22,887
I lied.

881
01:48:02,265 --> 01:48:03,722
Robert?

882
01:48:05,682 --> 01:48:07,139
Robert?

883
01:48:07,265 --> 01:48:08,806
He's asleep.

884
01:48:10,098 --> 01:48:11,840
I heard a noise.

885
01:48:12,098 --> 01:48:13,639
Yes, so did I.

886
01:48:14,015 --> 01:48:16,799
Go back to bed, it was nothing.

887
01:48:23,473 --> 01:48:25,049
Robert!

888
01:48:25,973 --> 01:48:27,632
My son!

889
01:48:38,682 --> 01:48:41,964
Come out of there! Bitch!

890
01:48:43,890 --> 01:48:45,715
Where are you?

891
01:49:00,890 --> 01:49:02,928
I knew it.

892
01:51:02,098 --> 01:51:03,721
Hello.

893
01:51:13,515 --> 01:51:15,506
You see to her.

894
01:51:17,723 --> 01:51:19,299
Good morning.

895
01:51:32,640 --> 01:51:34,465
What did you want?

896
01:51:36,348 --> 01:51:38,386
Is anything wrong?

897
01:51:39,473 --> 01:51:41,547
Are you all right?

898
01:51:45,390 --> 01:51:48,139
I don't know where to begin, Cristina.

899
01:51:50,223 --> 01:51:52,179
Do you know me?

900
01:51:53,015 --> 01:51:56,843
I'm Vicente.
I've just escaped.

901
01:51:57,890 --> 01:52:01,386
I was kidnapped.
They gave me a sex change.

902
01:52:03,807 --> 01:52:06,888
I had to kill two people to get away.

903
01:52:08,932 --> 01:52:11,088
You have to help me.

904
01:52:16,015 --> 01:52:17,721
Look.

905
01:52:18,432 --> 01:52:20,469
Do you remember this dress?

906
01:52:22,765 --> 01:52:26,841
Before Casilda's wedding,
six years ago...

907
01:52:27,182 --> 01:52:29,303
I said I'd give it to you...

908
01:52:29,723 --> 01:52:32,259
just to see how it looked.

909
01:52:32,348 --> 01:52:36,721
You said if I liked it so much,
I should wear it myself.

910
01:52:38,765 --> 01:52:43,588
At that moment we were alone, remember?

911
01:52:50,848 --> 01:52:52,922
Is anything wrong?

912
01:52:55,098 --> 01:52:57,552
Come here a moment, ma'am.

913
01:53:10,807 --> 01:53:13,509
Why are you crying?

914
01:53:24,682 --> 01:53:27,052
I'm Vicente.
