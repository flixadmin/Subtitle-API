989
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,833
Don't worry.
Mom's gonna be okay.

990
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,753
I'm proof that everything
works out all right.

991
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:05,463
We both are.

992
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:08,216
- You...

993
00:41:08,258 --> 00:41:10,260
you and Iris?

994
00:41:10,302 --> 00:41:12,595
- Not...not exactly.

995
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:14,013
Um...

996
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:15,598
But, uh...hey!

997
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,892
I mean, if you're happy
to see me,

998
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:20,478
you're gonna be twice as happy

999
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:22,021
in just a second.

1000
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:24,149
[whooshes]

1001
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,817
- Whoo!

1002
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:28,861
Hoo! What did I miss?

1003
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:31,030
- Dad, meet your son, Bart.

1004
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:33,074
- Hey, Dad!
What's good?

1005
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:34,659
Or "Pops."
Can I call you Pops yet?

1006
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,119
You like it when I call you
Pops later.

1007
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:37,370
I can't remember
when that is, though.

1008
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:40,123
Yo, this place is crash!

1009
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:06,899
- Greg, move your head.
