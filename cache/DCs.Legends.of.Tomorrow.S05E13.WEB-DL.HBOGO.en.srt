1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,080
All right, Legends.
Let's get this show on the road.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,400
Can't let this immortality buzz
go to waste.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,920
For your convenience,
I started a countdown timer.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,640
Twenty-three hours and 45 minutes
to save my brother.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,960
- You're welcome.
- All right.

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,360
You heard the lady.

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,600
Clock is ticking.

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,680
Yeah, let's get back to the ship

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,360
and fire up the loom
before it's too late.

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,280
Has anyone seen Gary
because someone at your party

11
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,240
has stolen my Shadow Stone.

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,560
So, if you come across
a disembodied voice

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,760
floating around,

14
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,760
crying out like a baby,
then that's your culprit.

15
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,160
Yeah, Gary went back to the ship.

16
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,400
His bunny has IBS.

17
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,000
Yeah, and serious gas issues.

18
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,880
Wow, that is some arctic breeze
blowing in.

19
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,200
Why are we in England?

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,880
Where the bloody hell is the portal?

21
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,080
Has anyone seen Astra?

22
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,680
How's your tummy, my bunny-wummy?

23
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,200
Gideon, can you do me a favor?

24
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,040
Can you fabricate more veggies
for Gary Junior II?

25
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,720
Gideon? You there?

26
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,320
<i>Gary, the ship's compromised.
They're shutting me down.</i>

27
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,160
If Gideon is down, then...

28
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,240
Who's flying the ship?

29
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,040
Oh, come on.
Are you lot off your trolleys?

30
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,360
Because I mean,
why would Astra steal the Waverider?

31
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,160
I know we're "friends" with her now,
but maybe she wanted to use the Loom.

32
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,840
Or what if my sisters got to her?

33
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,600
If they get control of the Loom
before we do,

34
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,360
we'll never get a chance
to bring my brother back.

35
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,560
Okay. Let's all just keep our cool.

36
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,360
Gideon, what's going on?

37
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,640
Gideon?

38
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,560
- Okay, no Gideon.
- Yeah, it's okay, it's okay.

39
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,840
We'll figure this out.

40
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,760
What just happened?

41
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,040
Did you have another vision?

42
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,200
No, it's, it was nothing.

43
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,320
As in, you saw nothing or what?

44
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,560
It was just a flash,
and then it was nothing.

45
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,720
I think it's the Chalice.

46
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,320
It's probably messing with my powers.

47
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,520
So, what?

48
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,000
Now, you're just blind?

49
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,160
- Mick, that's insensitive.
- That's not helpful.

50
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,200
Wait, wait, wait. I think
I just came up with an amazing plan.

51
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,520
Rip set up Time Bureau safe houses
all over the world,

52
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,480
some of which are still standing,
like the one in London.

53
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,800
Yes?

54
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,120
We go there, we get a Time Courier,
he'll take us to the Waverider.

55
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,200
- Yes.
- Yes. Okay.

56
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,320
Yeah, babe, that is a perfect plan.

57
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,000
And you know what? We're gonna do it.

58
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,680
We're gonna go to London
because we are immortal superheroes.

59
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,720
- Except me.
- Except for Zari.

60
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,280
And nothing is gonna stand
in our way.

61
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,880
We're immortal and we're superheroes,
and we have to wait for the bus.

62
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,960
Yeah.

63
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,840
Well, at least Constantine got us
these nice warm clothes.

64
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,680
- We're ready for anything, right?
- Yeah, like a pheasant hunt.

65
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,680
But in our defense,
we do look pretty good.

66
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,760
Okay, tell me this.

67
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,920
How do you live here
and not have a car?

68
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,200
Never needed one, love.
Always bummed a ride.

69
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,200
So, exactly how far is it to London?

70
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,640
Well, according to my phone,
it says 275.8...

71
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,240
- Miles or kilometers?
- Doesn't matter, it's far.

72
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,760
When is the bus supposed to get here?

73
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,880
According to the schedule,

74
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,680
it'll be here in either one minute
or three hours.

75
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,320
- Wait. Guys, is it a holiday?
- Is it a holiday?

76
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,280
- Finally.
- Yes.

77
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,760
- There we go.
- Okay.

78
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,280
Now, hold up. Who's paying the fare?

79
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,440
Does anybody have any money?

80
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
No.

81
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,520
Sir, I know this sounds ridiculous,

82
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,360
but the fate of the world
depends on us getting on this bus.

83
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,480
I don't care who depends on who.

84
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,480
When I'm driving this bus,
everyone pays the fare.

85
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,800
Have it your way.

86
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,760
Well, come on.

87
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,120
I really am so sorry, sir.

88
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,720
Believe it or not,
we're the good guys.

89
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,200
Bollocks!

90
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,080
Thank you for delivering
this lovely Timeship.

91
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,480
And Atropos,
thank you for shutting off

92
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,280
that aggravating talking computer.

93
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,720
She thought she was so witty.

94
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,440
You don't have to thank me.

95
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,280
It's not like I had a choice.

96
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,000
You called in your favor, after all.

97
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,800
Everything comes at a price, Astra.

98
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,240
I gave you a shot
at killing John Constantine,

99
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,560
and you squandered that.

100
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,720
{\an5}You drank from the Chalice
of Dionysus.

101
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,560
You're immortal for a day
and can operate the Loom of Fate.

102
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,200
Are you asking me to work with you?

103
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,440
Because I'm not hearing a question.

104
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,960
Fine, I'll join you.

105
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,480
- But I have some demands.
- Demands?

106
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,640
- Really?
- Yeah.

107
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,560
Now I've experienced life
on Earth again,

108
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,960
some things have got to change.

109
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,040
Like prunes.

110
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,760
Disgusting. I want them gone.

111
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,000
And dogs,
they should stay puppies forever.

112
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,600
Oh, and there's just one more thing.

113
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,960
I want to bring
my mother back to life.

114
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,680
Let's kill her.

115
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,160
I'm immortal.

116
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,920
- Remember?
- For now.

117
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,600
Astra's friends
will be searching for us by now.

118
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,960
Do something productive
and take care of them

119
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:48,520
while I chat with Astra
about this list of demands.

120
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,880
Now, tell me about these prunes.

121
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,840
Should I tell Mick that he's driving
on the wrong side of the road

122
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,280
- or just...
- No, definitely not.

123
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,960
It'll just confuse him more.

124
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,680
- Okay.
- Speaking of driving,

125
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,680
maybe you should run point
on this mission.

126
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,400
What? Wait.

127
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,000
Is this because you're blind?

128
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,880
Because you totally killed it
at beer pong.

129
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,080
Thank you.

130
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,280
But now that I can't see the future,
you know,

131
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,680
just thinking maybe
I'm more useful as a foot soldier.

132
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,800
And plus, you're exactly
who the team needs right now.

133
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,960
Okay, fine.

134
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,840
But this is only temporary.

135
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,360
Because as far as I'm concerned,
we are co-captains for life.

136
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,320
Always.

137
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,080
Rise again, oh fallen souls.

138
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,680
We seek revenge.

139
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,760
Help conquer our foes.

140
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,360
Who's that?

141
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,400
We're gonna get your brother back.

142
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,440
We're just taking,
you know, the scenic route.

143
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,440
Oh, you have got to be kidding me.

144
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,240
Oh, you must be joking.
What are you doing?

145
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,160
Oh, I'm just having a little chin wag
with an old friend.

146
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,600
- Come on, give it here.
- This is not your friend.

147
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,160
I thought you quit.
Why are you starting again?

148
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,760
Because I trusted Astra
and then she betrayed me

149
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,000
by siding with Charlie's sisters.

150
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,320
You know, once they use the Loom,
we're all as good as dead anyway.

151
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,160
This doomsday act
is getting super old.

152
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,400
Look around. The sky hasn't fallen.

153
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,880
The world is still here.

154
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,360
And for whatever reason,
the cabal of mystical seamstresses

155
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,520
hasn't started spinning yet.

156
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,120
Which means
we still have time to stop them.

157
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,240
So, just don't do that.

158
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,320
- Fine.
- It's so gross.

159
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,360
- Oh, damn, Mick, you killed her.
- No, I didn't.

160
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,720
How do you know?

161
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,280
She's moving.

162
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,160
Ma'am, maybe,
maybe you should just stay down.

163
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,520
Are you okay?

164
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,600
What is it?

165
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,400
Punch it! Punch it!

166
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,600
Nice one.

167
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,520
Oh, we've seen this before
in the forest

168
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,440
where Atropos was chasing us.

169
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,200
My sister will do everything
she can to stop us.

170
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,760
Then we're probably
gonna start seeing

171
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,480
a lot more of these zombies soon.

172
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,640
Or now.

173
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,400
Let's go!

174
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,760
Oh, come on, really?

175
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,720
What the hell, John?
Now you have a death wish?

176
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,080
Oh, come on. Don't be daft.

177
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,000
See, apparently, the good thing
about having a damned soul

178
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,840
is these zombies
aren't interested in me.

179
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,000
Cool demo.
Could you do something now?

180
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,120
Yeah, okay. Watch.

181
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,080
All right, team.
We gotta stick to the plan.

182
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,360
Let's get this bus up and running
before more of these come back.

183
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,440
Maybe this cable
will get Gideon back online.

184
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,680
Gideon?

185
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,320
Should have paid more attention
in computer science.

186
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,800
<i>Wake up, sleepyhead.</i>

187
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,720
Are you an angel?

188
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,440
Am I dead?

189
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,840
Oh, you're not dead, Gary.

190
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,160
And I'm Gideon.

191
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,840
You're Gideon?

192
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,240
But you're so...

193
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,040
You're so... human.

194
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,480
Are you real?

195
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,840
Well, I could explain,
but it wouldn't matter one bit.

196
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,760
Now, listen to me very carefully

197
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,840
because you have a rather important
job to do.

198
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,600
- I do?
- Yes.

199
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,120
You must hide those very important
and powerful rings

200
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,800
from those evil sisters.

201
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,840
The fate of the world depends on it.

202
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,240
Now, come on, Gary.

203
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,560
It's time to get to work.

204
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,400
Guys, come on. We gotta keep moving

205
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,400
before my sisters
send something else our way.

206
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,640
Well, the engine's busted
after the fight,

207
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,240
and the fuel pump's got no power.

208
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,840
Even if we fix the pump,

209
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,840
all this leaking fluid tells me
this is a lost cause.

210
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,160
- Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, relax.
- Doesn't...

211
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,400
Remember when we all worked together
to defeat a time demon?

212
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,080
We can make it to London
if we just work together.

213
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,960
All right. How long is it going
to take to fix the engine?

214
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,920
- An hour.
- Maybe two.

215
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,160
To be honest, I don't know anything
about mechanics, so...

216
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,520
All right. We're running out of time.

217
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,920
You live around here.
You must know someone with a car.

218
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,440
- Yeah, I might know a bloke.
- Great.

219
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,240
Wait, Zari.
Shouldn't you stay with us?

220
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,440
You're not immortal.

221
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,760
Look, I can't just sit here
and do nothing.

222
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,560
- What...
- Hey, hey, hey.

223
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,080
- I got her. It's fine.
- Hey, no, no, no.

224
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,560
Where are you guys going?
We're not supposed to split up.

225
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,200
That's not a part of the plan.

226
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,480
Astra, dear, we have been
very patient with you,

227
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,400
especially considering
you betrayed us

228
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,480
without saying a word.

229
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,160
You betrayed me first.

230
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,720
Besides, I had to take my destiny
into my own hands

231
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,600
and try to bring my mother
back myself.

232
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,880
And I appreciate your gumption.

233
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,160
But I'm afraid you don't fully grasp
what that means.

234
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,240
Right now, my mother is dead.

235
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,120
I would like her to be alive.

236
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,800
Fairly simple concept.

237
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,880
But as you know,
life as a human is very difficult.

238
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,840
If you insist on having a normal life
with your mother,

239
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,920
you will be bound
to the rules of nature,

240
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,040
which are not kind to humans.

241
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,040
See for yourself.

242
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,680
Why would you show me that?

243
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,480
Because
that is what is going to happen

244
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,200
if you bring your mother back.

245
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,680
Life as a human is a life of pain
and suffering.

246
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,200
Constantine promised
to bring your mother back

247
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,200
as if it would solve
all your problems.

248
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,720
But what he didn't tell you...

249
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,880
is you're just postponing
the inevitable.

250
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:12,520
Why bring your mother back,
only to lose her all over again?

251
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,480
Look, I couldn't just sit in that bus
and do nothing.

252
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,200
Oh, I suppose it's good to go
through the motions.

253
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,400
At least it gives you
the illusion of control.

254
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,920
Yeah, I'm not just going through
the motions,

255
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,200
I'm actually doing something
to save my brother.

256
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,200
Yeah, and I was actually
trying to help Astra,

257
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,440
and look what happened there.

258
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,080
You may see no point in trying,
but I'm not giving up.

259
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,400
Have you ever considered
the possibility

260
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,120
that your brother's fate
is doomed in every timeline?

261
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,160
Apparently, this bloke, Rip Hunter,
used to say that,

262
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,760
you know,
certain things are just inevitable.

263
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,120
Go to hell, John.

264
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,440
You know,
I've been there and back, love.

265
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,880
Look, I'm just trying to save you
the disappointment, is all.

266
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,200
You know what?
Let's just walk in silence.

267
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,360
Cool? Cool.

268
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,920
Yeah.

269
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,200
Real smooth, Johnny.

270
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,560
Real smooth.

271
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,280
She's so intriguing.

272
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,600
Gary, she's positively evil.

273
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,640
But she's so talented
with those weird knives.

274
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,280
Well, never mind her
many splendid talents, Gary.

275
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,480
I must ask you to focus,
pay attention now.

276
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,960
Okay,
but how are we gonna distract her

277
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,120
to grab the rings
so she doesn't notice?

278
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,440
I've got an idea.

279
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,360
Wish me luck.

280
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,320
Good luck.

281
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,800
What's up?

282
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,160
I really don't think
I should have let John and Zari go.

283
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,640
What if we get the bus up
and running before they get back?

284
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,040
Or even worse, more zombies?

285
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,600
- Then what am I supposed to...
- Hey.

286
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,240
Don't sweat it
if the plan falls apart.

287
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,720
Sometimes, the best solutions come
when there is no plan at all.

288
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,240
Besides,
Legends are all about improvisation.

289
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,800
It's kind of like, free-form jazz.

290
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,320
- I hate free-form jazz.
- Yeah, me too.

291
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,120
Sounds like we have company.

292
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,160
Whoa, I think those are soldiers.

293
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,000
Maybe they can help us get to London.

294
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,280
What did I tell you?

295
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,240
- Oh, hey, guys, hi.
- Hands up!

296
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,240
- Oh, we are so glad you found us.
- Stay where you are.

297
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,680
They've got blood on their clothes.

298
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,000
They might be infected.

299
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,200
- What? No.
- No.

300
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,160
Oh, no. It's not.

301
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,600
No, no, no, we're not infected.

302
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,600
Ava.

303
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,280
Oh, my God.

304
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,320
My God.

305
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,320
These zombies
can withstand headshots.

306
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,640
Since when do zombies talk,
you idiot?

307
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,000
Super zombies have become sentient.

308
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,360
Round them up and take them back
to base camp.

309
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,960
Your hands where I can see them.

310
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,160
Lachesis?

311
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,320
- Yes.
- The rings are gone.

312
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,840
I don't understand.
How could this happen?

313
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,360
There must be someone else
on the ship.

314
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,360
You're right.

315
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,240
Someone else is here.

316
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,560
And I know exactly who it is.

317
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,200
I got the rings.

318
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,920
We make an amazing team.

319
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,280
We should have our own spin-off.

320
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,560
<i>Gideon and Gary</i>

321
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,240
<i>Having adventures</i>

322
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,840
<i>Solving problems</i>

323
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,760
<i>And saving the world</i>

324
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,160
Brilliant song, Gary.

325
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,240
You must teach it to me once
you've managed to wrestle control

326
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,640
of the Waverider
from those pesky sisters.

327
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,240
I know how we can do that.

328
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,560
We'll blow up the ship.

329
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,360
Or, perhaps, we'll do something
just a smidge less suicidal.

330
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,280
Oh, that sounds like fun.

331
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,840
Let's track down a Courier,

332
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,760
so we can jump the rest
of the Legends here.

333
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,920
Well, what are we waiting for?

334
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,800
Let's go to the lab
and make those Couriers ours.

335
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,080
Gary, you're making me blush.

336
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,200
Let's go.

337
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,040
This is charming.

338
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,600
How did you hear about this place?

339
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,520
Back in the day, old man Joe

340
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,640
called me about
a demon-possessed '75 Fiat.

341
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,480
It was a right messy exorcism.

342
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,120
And a right crappy car.

343
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,200
Now, there's a beauty.

344
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,440
All right, come on.

345
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,560
We don't want to be out here
any longer than we have to be.

346
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,400
What was that?

347
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,560
It is not a sound we want to be
waiting around for.

348
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,680
Okay, let's go, this way, go.

349
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,600
Okay, I'll go find the van keys.

350
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,840
Yeah, all right, yeah.

351
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,120
You do that.

352
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,480
Okay.

353
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,400
Thanks, Old Man Joe.

354
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,160
What is that infernal racket?
Are you all right?

355
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,280
Yup. Yeah. I am fine. Just...

356
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,880
Filing this away for future therapy.

357
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,280
Okay.

358
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,920
We better leg it to that chip van
before you become zombie fodder.

359
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,960
John, there's too many of them
out there.

360
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,200
But they're not interested in you.

361
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,640
You need to take the van,
find the team and save Behrad.

362
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,600
No, no, no, that is a terrible idea.

363
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,760
Why, because you didn't think of it?

364
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,000
Because I'm not leaving you here
to die, all right?

365
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,720
That's it.

366
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,480
Oh, now you're good
with leaving me to die?

367
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,720
Yes to death, no to leaving.

368
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,640
You see, there was this spell
that the ancient Egyptians...

369
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,160
I don't need the history lesson,
John, just do it.

370
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,960
Yeah, all right,
but it means stopping your heart.

371
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,840
And when I do that,
we've only got a few minutes

372
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,960
before the rest of you stops.
It's risky and anything can go wrong.

373
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,800
You know what?
This whole day has gone wrong,

374
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,080
so, why stop now?

375
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,320
Why, indeed?

376
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,520
You're making a huge mistake.

377
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,880
What sentient zombies
are this well-dressed?

378
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,440
Damn it. I promised Lita
I would never get locked up again.

379
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,600
This stays between us.

380
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,560
Okay, I am,
I am just gonna make up a speech.

381
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,400
About what? I don't know.
Just made up on the spot.

382
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,800
Ava's lost it, she's lost it.

383
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,920
- She's thinking...
- Okay.

384
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
You know what, guys?

385
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,360
We are not wasting any more time
in this tin can.

386
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,160
Let's try to get creative
and think about

387
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,040
- what resources we have.
- Okay.

388
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,600
Look, we've got a guy
who turns into steel.

389
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,600
We've got a shapeshifter, right?

390
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,080
That's friggin' amazing.
We've got a kickass blind assassin.

391
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,240
And a reformed thief
turned romance novelist.

392
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,000
Who you calling reformed?

393
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,320
Oh. Well...

394
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,960
Wait a minute.

395
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,440
I've been locked up in one
of these before.

396
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,720
There's a weak door,

397
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,000
down here somewhere.

398
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,680
Steel boy, punch.

399
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,080
I'd be honored.

400
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,920
Whoa, wait, what, so we're gonna just
jump out of a moving car?

401
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,960
Well, you know, we're not gonna die,
but it's really gonna hurt.

402
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,440
- Okay, who's first?
- You!

403
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,880
- Oh, God!
- Out of here, sucker!

404
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,480
All right, then,
well, come on, step right up.

405
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,160
- You got her?
- Yeah, got her. Yeah.

406
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,400
I'm actually glad I can't see
what's about to happen.

407
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,120
Ready? And jump,

408
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,120
Gravity's actually
not a part of the plan.

409
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,040
Well, Ava,
as far as inspirational speeches go,

410
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,760
- I give that a gentleman's seven.
- You know what?

411
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,880
I will take it because now we are,
80 miles from London, which is,

412
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,560
you know, closer than we were before.

413
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,240
- Yeah.
- We're never gonna make it.

414
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,440
- Hey. Never say "never."
- Hey.

415
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,600
Hey, hey, hey.

416
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,600
- Can you help us?
- Let's just out.

417
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,120
Don't stop, Wilbur.

418
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,280
Zombies!

419
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,880
Damn it.

420
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,320
You're giving off a vibe.

421
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,600
Oh, man.

422
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,360
- Come on, babe, we gotta walk.
- I'm coming.

423
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,000
All right, love. Can you give me
a bit of room here, eh?

424
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,960
Sure.

425
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,920
Okay.

426
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,840
If I die,
I can't believe the last thing

427
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,040
I'm gonna see is your face.

428
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,560
Yeah, well, better than those zombies
out there, eh?

429
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,920
Debatable.

430
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,520
Yeah.

431
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,720
All right, love.

432
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,800
Close your eyes now.

433
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,960
Okay.

434
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:09,600
(Foreign language)

435
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,240
(Foreign language)

436
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,400
(Foreign language)

437
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,960
(Foreign language)

438
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:15,240
(Foreign language)

439
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:22,240
(Foreign language)

440
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,880
Oh, no, no.

441
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,280
Don't do this to me.
Don't do this to me.

442
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,720
Come on, Zari, come on.

443
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,160
Come on, don't do this.

444
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,640
Come on, come back to me, love.

445
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,720
Come back to me.

446
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,280
Is this what a hangover feels like?

447
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,360
We need to get out of here.

448
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,240
- Got one.
- Smashing job, Gary.

449
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,720
Now, let's go get your friends,

450
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,760
so we can finish this adventure
once and for all.

451
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,120
Easy enough.

452
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,800
Drop it.

453
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,600
She means it.

454
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,280
She'll skin you alive.

455
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,680
What are you doing, Astra?
Why are you working with them?

456
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,880
Now, give us the rings.

457
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,080
We know you have them.

458
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,040
Gideon, run, save yourself!

459
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,120
The moron is speaking to the rabbit.

460
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,640
The rings are in your pocket.

461
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,760
Give them to us.

462
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,400
Gideon?

463
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,120
Help me.

464
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,560
I can't, Gary.

465
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,680
I'm just a figment
of your imagination.

466
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,920
But you must believe in yourself.

467
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,920
And don't give in,
no matter what they do.

468
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,640
How could I give you the rings
if they were never really here?

469
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,920
- Trickery.
- Yeah.

470
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,880
I may have been electrocuted
by Gideon's mainframe,

471
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,080
but I could still do
a simple obfuscation spell.

472
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,120
Time for more persuasive tactics.

473
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,320
Those headlights are coming in fast.

474
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,240
All right, everybody. Just be cool.

475
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,240
Yeah, try to act as un-zombie-like
as possible.

476
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,200
Maybe Mick should stand in the back.

477
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,760
Get in, losers, we're going looming.

478
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,440
Yeah.

479
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,360
Hello?

480
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,200
Ex-Director Sharpe here,
who's manning this post?

481
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,240
Well, cheers to this nightmare
of a day coming to an end soon.

482
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,560
- I'll drink to that.
- Yeah, well,

483
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,000
we're not out of the woods yet, love,

484
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,000
but you can sign me up
for a beer anytime.

485
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,120
Yup, John was right.
We are not out of the woods yet.

486
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,200
Is it dead?

487
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,480
Yeah, how did you know?

488
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,160
Great, that's just great.

489
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,480
My brother's gone forever,
and the world's gonna end

490
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,320
because someone forgot to charge it.

491
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,400
Great.

492
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,440
Smoke break?

493
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,360
Actually...

494
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,400
I quit smoking.

495
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,880
Again.

496
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,640
Don't tell me you finally
found something to live for.

497
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,800
There's no point.

498
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,680
The Fates are literally against us.

499
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,920
I mean, how else do you explain
an overnight zombie apocalypse?

500
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,880
Or the fact that we're now
at the mercy of a charger?

501
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:26,400
You know, I gotta say, all this doom
and gloom attitude

502
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,000
really don't suit you, love.

503
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,960
I'm sorry, I didn't realize you had
a monopoly on doom and gloom.

504
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,400
No, I'm just saying, you know,

505
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,440
you stick to what you know best,
is all.

506
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,080
Yeah, I'm not gonna take advice
from a professional exorcist

507
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,640
with a savior complex.

508
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,800
Come on,
I do not have a savior complex.

509
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,360
Are you serious right now?

510
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,200
"Oh, save me from my demons,
John Constantine."

511
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,800
Oh, what about you, then? I mean,
you talk about savior complex,

512
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,160
what with all your self-help
and advice videos.

513
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,720
Saving your minions
from a life of drudgery.

514
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,080
I give my followers something
to aspire to.

515
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,760
Aspire to? Really?

516
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,840
What's that, then?

517
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:02,480
Oh, yeah,
it's being a superficial git.

518
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,160
If you think I'm superficial,
then why are you here with me?

519
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,440
Do you know what,
I don't know, I just think

520
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,200
I haven't had enough punishment
for one day.

521
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,440
Punishment?

522
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,360
You should just go, then. Right now.

523
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,720
You want me to leave?
Because I will leave.

524
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,800
I will go right now

525
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,680
- and not come back.
- Good, great. Leave.

526
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,800
I wouldn't wanna be with you
right now,

527
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,160
if you were the last man on Earth.

528
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,520
Well, good,
because I wouldn't wanna be with you

529
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,680
if you were the last woman...

530
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,800
So, where should we start?

531
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,200
Head, shoulders, knees or toes?

532
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:45,080
How about none of those things?

533
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,040
You can hand me those rings
or you can give me your hands,

534
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,320
it is that simple.

535
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,720
This isn't you.

536
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,200
You're not like them.

537
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,160
You don't know a thing about me.

538
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,240
I do know that when you had to choose
between staying in hell

539
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,720
or putting your trust in the Legends,

540
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,400
you grabbed Ava's hand
and took a leap of faith.

541
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,360
That was a mistake.

542
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,000
A moment of weakness
when I still believed

543
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,600
I wanted to see my mother.

544
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,760
Wait.

545
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
You don't want your mother
to come back anymore?

546
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,520
Not if it means losing her
all over again.

547
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,800
Lachesis opened my eyes
and showed me her death

548
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,960
and what it would be like
if I brought her back.

549
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,520
You actually had to see
your mother die?

550
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,880
Are you okay? Because if I were you,
I'd be a big puddle of...

551
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,000
Of course I am not okay.

552
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,960
It was bad enough losing her
when I was a kid.

553
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,880
But did this Lachesis lady
show you anything else?

554
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,440
Like, what about
all the good moments?

555
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,520
- Before she died.
- Why bother?

556
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:51,040
Those memories
would be painful reminders

557
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,360
of what I would one day have to lose.

558
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,480
You must have some memories
of your mom

559
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,680
when you were little
that make you smile.

560
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Right?

561
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,120
Well, maybe, instead of torturing me,
you could...

562
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,680
I don't know, share one?

563
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,040
You guys good?

564
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,120
Yeah, feeling a little better.

565
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,960
Wow. Those yams?

566
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,440
Horrible, aren't they?

567
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,680
Look, guys, I know today was...

568
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,760
was rough. I mean...

569
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,840
You got shot in the head,
for Pete's sake.

570
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,920
Do you have to bring that up?

571
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:33,760
And if I could,
I'd spend every day like this.

572
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,480
Sitting around with my pals.

573
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,440
Well, you could end every day
any way you like

574
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,960
with the Loom of Fate, mate.

575
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,440
You know, after we best your sister,

576
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:45,320
any one of us might be called
to use the Loom,

577
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,920
and you got to ask the question,
what kind of temptations we'd have?

578
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,000
I'm actually pretty happy just...

579
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:57,000
flying through time with you guys,
and I got my lady.

580
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,640
I'm pretty happy.

581
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,080
Same.

582
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,760
I'd be a criminal again.

583
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,160
The simple life.

584
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:11,160
You know, if Behrad were alive
and we were together and happy, I...

585
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:17,160
I don't know, I would use my talents
to make the world a more...

586
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,440
inclusive, better place, I guess.

587
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:27,920
Well, I, for one,
would throw a multi-continent rager.

588
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,640
- Would you really, though, John-o?
- I would, yeah.

589
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,800
There's nothing a little deeper...

590
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,800
little closer to your heart?

591
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,160
Oh, you know...

592
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,480
Even after everything
that's happened.

593
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,160
I'd wanna do right by Astra,
you know.

594
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:53,200
Make sure she was happy growing up
in a big house,

595
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,200
and I could keep an eye on her.

596
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,440
Sure is nice to dream.

597
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,560
I'll drink to that.

598
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,200
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

599
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,960
Okay.

600
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,760
What are you not telling me?

601
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,440
Nothing.

602
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,720
Come on.

603
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,920
Let me guess.

604
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,840
You didn't really lose your powers.
Yeah?

605
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,440
You had a vision.

606
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,600
And you saw the future,
and you don't want to tell me

607
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,440
about what happened. Am I right?

608
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,360
The Courier
is not gonna charge in time.

609
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,600
In time for what?

610
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,080
In time to escape
before that front door

611
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,520
gets busted down by what's outside.

612
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,160
Why'd you lie to me, babe?

613
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:00,000
Because my vision ended
with me dying here.

614
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,680
In this pub.

615
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,080
Sorry, what?

616
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,480
Oh, my God,
I can't really think straight.

617
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,120
- I just...
- It's okay.

618
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,280
This is why I didn't wanna tell you.

619
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,440
I didn't want to distract you
from getting the team to this moment.

620
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,120
Okay, so you have been saying goodbye

621
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,680
and just pushing me
to take over this whole time?

622
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,880
Yes, but it's a temporary goodbye,
all right?

623
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:31,320
Because you guys,
you're gonna, you're gonna fix this,

624
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,480
and you're gonna save the day.

625
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,640
Did you happen
to have some sort of vision

626
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,760
of how we saved the day, Sara,

627
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,480
because that would be
really helpful right now.

628
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,840
I wish, but, no,

629
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,440
I couldn't see anything past
my death.

630
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,520
That was it.

631
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,120
Okay.

632
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,280
And what if we don't succeed?

633
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,600
I have faith in you, babe.

634
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,480
And I have faith in this team.

635
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:53,040
And after I go,
you will fix it, I know it.

636
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,080
I don't wanna freak you guys out,
but...

637
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,360
we're completely surrounded
by zombies.

638
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,120
Looks like they're biding their time
until our immortality runs out.

639
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,360
Well, damnees,
the inevitable has arrived.

640
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,440
Kiss your immortality goodbye.

641
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,040
It's strange the memories you hold on
to when someone's gone.

642
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,760
My mom loved strawberries.

643
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,160
And one year we went
strawberry picking at this farm.

644
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,840
And we just ate them
right off the vine.

645
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,320
They didn't even make it
to the basket.

646
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,200
We just spent the whole day
stuffing ourselves.

647
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,160
Sounds like a cool lady.

648
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,400
She was.

649
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,120
Think about all the strawberries
you could pick if you came...

650
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,320
Okay, enough wheedling.

651
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,880
Just show me
how to use this damn thing,

652
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,360
so we can get help
and I can bring her back already.

653
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,760
Okay, yeah.

654
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,800
- So...
- Congratulations.

655
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,000
You're just as weak
as any other human.

656
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,680
Your immortality has run out.

657
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,360
Time's up.

658
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,560
The rings.

659
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,280
Or join your friend on the floor.

660
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,520
We just have to hold out
until the Courier charges.

661
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,840
The door's not gonna hold.

662
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,160
Once they're inside,
I'll hold them off as long as I can.

663
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Sara.

664
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,400
- Co-captains for life.
- Always.

665
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,760
Come on.

666
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,800
The bloody thing's still charging.

667
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,920
Hey, deadheads, over here.

668
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,600
Sara!

669
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,280
It's charged.

670
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,800
Charlie, you have to go.

671
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,280
Deal with your sisters and fix this.

672
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,200
- How?
- You've outsmarted them once before,

673
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,440
you can do it again.

674
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,840
Hey.

675
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,280
Gary.

676
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,640
Charlie, thank God you're here.

677
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,960
Your sisters took over the ship

678
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,960
and they somehow convinced Astra
to work with them,

679
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,200
and then I convinced her
she was wrong,

680
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,960
which is how she ended up
on the floor.

681
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,040
Where's everyone else?

682
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,040
There's no time to explain,
where are the rings?

683
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,480
Okay, yeah.

684
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,200
We have to be careful.

685
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,360
Your sisters were just...

686
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,600
What a pity.

687
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,760
You've come crawling back.

688
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,000
You're just in time, Clotho.

689
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,080
I'm done running.

690
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,080
Now, let's get to work.
