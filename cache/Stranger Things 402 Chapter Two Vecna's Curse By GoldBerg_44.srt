- Of Hop's?

293
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,880
"Hop is alive. No government"?

294
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:40,470
This looks and reads like a ransom note,
and a bad one at that.

295
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:43,100
- There's no proof of life here.
- Yes, there is.

296
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,930
It's signed "Enzo."

297
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,270
- So?
- So?

298
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:50,610
There's only two people
who knew about our date at Enzo's,

299
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:51,820
and that's me and Hop.

So, whoever wrote this,

301
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,860
Hop trusted enough
to make him sign it Enzo.

302

What's he doing in Russia?
He was captured, that's what.

316
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:45,740
Then he probably met some new friends.

317

And by friends, I mean the KGB.

318

And believe me when I tell you,
these people are the worst of the worst.

I am talking torture, Joyce.

320
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:59,340
And no matter how strong you think Jim is,

321
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,470
they will break him.

322

throw her dreams out the window

about what happened last night.

910
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:36,260
