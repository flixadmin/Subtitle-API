1
00:00:00,808 --> 00:00:02,195
Previously on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:02,845 --> 00:00:04,679
Tibetan pit viper
venom.

3
00:00:04,681 --> 00:00:06,892
A constant dose of that
can't be good for you, right?

4
00:00:06,973 --> 00:00:08,762
It'll keep him sedated
like it did Slade.

5
00:00:10,142 --> 00:00:11,752
No mention on
Isabel Rochev's death?

6
00:00:12,206 --> 00:00:13,972
Not a thing.

7
00:00:14,637 --> 00:00:16,704
Choose. Choose!

8
00:00:16,706 --> 00:00:18,606
No! No!

9
00:00:18,608 --> 00:00:20,484
No, mom! Mom,
what are you doing?

10
00:00:20,485 --> 00:00:23,086
Both my children will live.

11
00:00:23,088 --> 00:00:24,253
What are
you doing?!

12
00:00:24,255 --> 00:00:27,690
You possess true courage.

13
00:00:27,692 --> 00:00:30,827
No!

14
00:00:32,463 --> 00:00:35,498
There is still one person
who has to die...

15
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,501
Before this can end.

16
00:00:38,503 --> 00:00:40,069
- No...
- Mom?!

17
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:51,314
I do solemnly swear

18
00:00:51,316 --> 00:00:53,015
that I will support,

19
00:00:53,017 --> 00:00:57,587
defend, and abide by
the Starling City charter.

20
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,641
And that I will faithfully

21
00:01:18,643 --> 00:01:21,043
discharge the duties
of the office

22
00:01:21,045 --> 00:01:23,579
of mayor of Starling City.

23
00:01:35,192 --> 00:01:39,362
That I will tirelessly
pursue justice on behalf

24
00:01:39,364 --> 00:01:41,464
of all of starling's
citizens...

25
00:01:43,467 --> 00:01:44,834
Impartially,

26
00:01:44,836 --> 00:01:48,337
to the best of my abilities.

27
00:01:48,339 --> 00:01:50,406
So help me God.

28
00:01:52,544 --> 00:01:54,010
Thank you.

29
00:02:05,522 --> 00:02:07,190
Thea.

30
00:02:07,192 --> 00:02:09,859
Hi.

31
00:02:09,861 --> 00:02:11,561
I'm here for you.

32
00:02:11,563 --> 00:02:13,863
I know.

33
00:02:15,466 --> 00:02:17,500
Ms. Queen.

34
00:02:17,502 --> 00:02:21,971
I wanted to offer my sincere
condolences on your loss.

35
00:02:21,973 --> 00:02:24,340
Your mother was a good woman.

36
00:02:24,342 --> 00:02:26,042
She would have made
a wonderful mayor.

37
00:02:26,044 --> 00:02:28,211
Thank you.

38
00:02:28,213 --> 00:02:30,046
I'd love to speak with Oliver.

39
00:02:30,048 --> 00:02:31,981
Well, if you see him,

40
00:02:31,983 --> 00:02:34,350
tell him he missed his
own mother's funeral.

41
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,922
No one's seen Oliver
for a few days.

42
00:02:39,924 --> 00:02:42,658
We all deal with grief
in different ways.

43
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,194
And the loss of a parent is...

44
00:02:46,865 --> 00:02:49,131
Well, it changes you.

45
00:02:49,133 --> 00:02:51,567
When you realize that your
ancestors now look to you;

46
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:55,371
that your family's legacy,
their continuing works,

47
00:02:55,373 --> 00:02:57,573
are solely in your hands.

48
00:02:59,443 --> 00:03:01,244
If you see Oliver,
please tell him that I came by.

49
00:03:01,246 --> 00:03:03,279
Of course.

50
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:15,157
Hey.

51
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:17,126
Thanks.

52
00:03:19,296 --> 00:03:22,198
I don't even know
why I'm crying.

53
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,067
I didn't even
like Moira.

54
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:28,871
Terrible thing to say about
someone after they've just died.

55
00:03:28,873 --> 00:03:32,141
In my defense,
she was not nice.

56
00:03:33,277 --> 00:03:36,812
She was diabolical.

57
00:03:36,814 --> 00:03:40,550
Not a word you often
hear at someone's funeral.

58
00:03:40,552 --> 00:03:42,885
You're not crying for her, Felicity,
you're crying for Oliver.

59
00:03:42,887 --> 00:03:45,988
Where is he?

60
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:48,724
How could he
not be here?

61
00:03:48,726 --> 00:03:49,892
I don't know.

62
00:03:49,894 --> 00:03:52,461
If Oliver's smart...

63
00:03:52,463 --> 00:03:55,398
He ran back to his
island to hide.

64
00:03:57,167 --> 00:03:59,902
But maybe he'll attend
your funerals.

65
00:04:10,847 --> 00:04:14,350
I always loved
this photograph.

66
00:04:14,352 --> 00:04:18,854
I thought your mother
looked particularly beautiful.

67
00:04:18,856 --> 00:04:20,723
Well, she didn't.

68
00:04:20,725 --> 00:04:22,525
She thought
she looked bug-eyed.

69
00:04:22,527 --> 00:04:26,696
She never said.

70
00:04:27,831 --> 00:04:30,600
How are you holding up?
I'm not.

71
00:04:33,236 --> 00:04:36,872
Your mother gave her
life for you, Thea.

72
00:04:36,874 --> 00:04:39,475
She showed you how much
she loved you in ways

73
00:04:39,477 --> 00:04:41,611
very few parents
ever could.

74
00:04:41,613 --> 00:04:42,645
I know.

75
00:04:42,647 --> 00:04:45,748
She died thinking
I hated her.

76
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:49,318
But all we ever needed
was the truth.

77
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,587
It was a lie
that killed her.

78
00:04:51,589 --> 00:04:53,189
I don't understand.

79
00:04:53,191 --> 00:04:55,257
Slade Wilson.

80
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:58,661
He was on that
island with Oliver.

81
00:04:58,663 --> 00:05:03,032
And despises him
for some reason.

82
00:05:04,534 --> 00:05:07,003
There was a psychopath
in our lives

83
00:05:07,005 --> 00:05:09,705
and my brother never
warned us about him.

84
00:05:09,707 --> 00:05:13,943
Thea, your brother loves you
more than life itself.

85
00:05:16,113 --> 00:05:19,415
You should
keep that photo.

86
00:05:43,073 --> 00:05:45,808
This sub is over
60 years old.

87
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,545
It was carrying the Mirakuru during
the war when it ran aground.

88
00:05:54,451 --> 00:05:56,585
Blood.

89
00:05:56,587 --> 00:05:57,887
Slade's.

90
00:05:57,889 --> 00:06:01,424
He was bleeding out, dying.

91
00:06:01,426 --> 00:06:04,960
Until we decided
to give him the Mirakuru.

92
00:06:04,962 --> 00:06:07,063
Not one of your
better ideas.

93
00:06:07,065 --> 00:06:09,031
What about my idea
for you to fix this sub?

94
00:06:09,033 --> 00:06:11,033
You were in the Navy.
The Russian Navy.

95
00:06:11,035 --> 00:06:12,968
They taught us how
to sink Japanese sub, not pilot them.

96
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:14,904
Anatoly, please.

97
00:06:14,906 --> 00:06:17,106
I know it's a long shot,
but if we get this sub operational,

98
00:06:17,108 --> 00:06:19,475
we can blow Slade
and the Mirakuru out of the water

99
00:06:19,477 --> 00:06:21,444
and get the hell
off of this island.

100
00:06:21,446 --> 00:06:24,246
I mean, unless
you have a better idea,

101
00:06:24,248 --> 00:06:26,348
this is our only chance
of getting home.

102
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:29,485
Ok. I try.

103
00:06:31,288 --> 00:06:34,457
No one has seen Slade Wilson since
the night of the attack.

104
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:36,492
I mean, he hasn't made any further
threats on the Queen family,

105
00:06:36,494 --> 00:06:38,594
but we got to find
this son of a--

106
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,664
Excuse me. Hey.

107
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,299
Missed you
at the reception.

108
00:06:43,301 --> 00:06:44,934
Yeah. I had to get back here,

109
00:06:44,936 --> 00:06:46,474
see what was happening
with the case.

110
00:06:46,499 --> 00:06:47,571
Any leads?

111
00:06:47,572 --> 00:06:49,638
No. Wilson's a ghost.

112
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,660
He's not the only one
who's disappeared.

113
00:06:50,685 --> 00:06:52,042
You heard from your sister?

114
00:06:52,043 --> 00:06:55,111
Nothing apart from a text that
she needed a change of scenery.

115
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,014
Something else on your mind?

116
00:06:59,016 --> 00:07:01,884
It's Sebastian Blood.

117
00:07:01,886 --> 00:07:03,786
There's something that
doesn't seem right.

118
00:07:03,788 --> 00:07:07,123
Laurel...
Dad, I know what you're thinking.

119
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:10,126
When I accused him
of killing his father, I was upset.

120
00:07:10,128 --> 00:07:11,694
But just because
I had a problem

121
00:07:11,696 --> 00:07:13,562
doesn't mean
I was wrong about Sebastian.

122
00:07:13,564 --> 00:07:16,065
Please, don't go down
this road again, ok?

123
00:07:16,067 --> 00:07:18,467
What's bringing this on?

124
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:20,269
I saw him
at the reception.

125
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:22,872
And it struck me that the only reason
that he's mayor now

126
00:07:22,874 --> 00:07:24,807
is because Moira
was killed.

127
00:07:24,809 --> 00:07:26,008
Yeah, by Slade Wilson.

128
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,309
What if there's
a connection?

129
00:07:27,311 --> 00:07:28,711
You once told me,

130
00:07:28,713 --> 00:07:30,646
a cop is only as
good as his gut.

131
00:07:30,648 --> 00:07:32,581
Well, I'm the daughter
of a cop,

132
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:36,152
and I know in my gut Sebastian is not
the man that you think he is.

133
00:07:36,154 --> 00:07:37,720
You sure?

134
00:07:37,722 --> 00:07:39,755
Baby, last time...

135
00:07:39,757 --> 00:07:41,022
I was a drunk.

136
00:07:41,047 --> 00:07:43,026
And you were right
not to trust me.

137
00:07:43,561 --> 00:07:45,628
But, Dad...

138
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:48,798
I need you
to trust me now.

139
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,700
This legislation
is the first step

140
00:07:51,702 --> 00:07:55,004
toward making Starling City
the jewel that it once was.

141
00:07:55,006 --> 00:07:57,940
The jewel that
it can be again.

142
00:07:57,942 --> 00:08:02,378
Phone call for you,
mayor Blood.

143
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,347
I'm still getting used
to people calling me that, Alyssa.

144
00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:06,682
Please take a message.

145
00:08:06,684 --> 00:08:08,250
The caller insisted.

146
00:08:08,252 --> 00:08:10,219
He said he's your father.

147
00:08:10,221 --> 00:08:12,388
That's impossible.

148
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,490
Never mind.

149
00:08:14,492 --> 00:08:17,459
I'll take it.

150
00:08:18,962 --> 00:08:20,162
Hello?

151
00:08:20,164 --> 00:08:21,964
Hello, Sebastian.

152
00:08:21,966 --> 00:08:24,500
I'm sorry to bother you.
I just wanted to check in

153
00:08:24,502 --> 00:08:26,602
and see how
your first day is going.

154
00:08:26,604 --> 00:08:28,337
Very well,
thank you.

155
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:30,306
But I'm a little
busy right now,

156
00:08:30,308 --> 00:08:31,740
so if you'll allow me
to call you back,

157
00:08:31,742 --> 00:08:33,509
I'll do that
as soon as I can.

158
00:08:33,511 --> 00:08:36,045
I'm sure you have quite
a lot of business to attend to.

159
00:08:36,047 --> 00:08:39,748
You are the major
now, after all.

160
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,251
So get to work.

161
00:08:54,297 --> 00:08:56,665
We're almost
out of snake venom.

162
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:59,201
Seeing Roy like this
reminds me of Barry.

163
00:08:59,203 --> 00:09:01,403
And Barry reminds me
of S.T.A.R. Labs.

164
00:09:01,405 --> 00:09:04,406
S.T.A.R. Labs reminds me of the
Mirakuru cure that they're working on,

165
00:09:04,408 --> 00:09:07,943
which we could really
use...right now.

166
00:09:07,945 --> 00:09:12,114
Yeah, especially since Isabel Rochev
was clearly injected with the stuff.

167
00:09:12,116 --> 00:09:13,983
How do you know?
'Cause there's no other way

168
00:09:13,985 --> 00:09:15,851
she could be walking around
after being shot dead-on

169
00:09:15,853 --> 00:09:18,187
with a nine-millimeter
hollow point.

170
00:09:20,591 --> 00:09:22,725
I've left about
a dozen messages for Oliver

171
00:09:22,727 --> 00:09:25,427
about Isabel being back.
No response.

172
00:09:25,429 --> 00:09:27,363
You have any luck finding him?

173
00:09:27,365 --> 00:09:30,099
Tons. All of it bad.

174
00:09:30,101 --> 00:09:31,667
There's been
no activity

175
00:09:31,669 --> 00:09:33,702
on his passport,
cell phone,

176
00:09:33,704 --> 00:09:36,805
or bank accounts--
what's left of them, anyhow.

177
00:09:36,807 --> 00:09:39,642
And facial recognition
hasn't spotted him in any airport,

178
00:09:39,644 --> 00:09:41,210
bus, or train station.

179
00:09:41,212 --> 00:09:42,778
Right.

180
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,346
What about Sara?

181
00:09:44,348 --> 00:09:46,215
Nothing either.

182
00:09:46,217 --> 00:09:48,784
Dig, people don't just go missing
like this, unless...

183
00:09:48,786 --> 00:09:50,886
Don't go there,
Felicity.

184
00:09:50,888 --> 00:09:53,389
What if she is?

185
00:09:53,391 --> 00:09:56,492
What if Oliver is?

186
00:09:56,494 --> 00:09:58,027
Maybe the reason we can't
find him is because--

187
00:09:58,029 --> 00:10:00,529
He's alive, Felicity.

188
00:10:00,531 --> 00:10:03,065
If he wasn't, Isabel Rochev
wouldn't be so shy

189
00:10:03,067 --> 00:10:05,467
about rubbing it in our faces.
Believe me, he's alive.

190
00:10:05,469 --> 00:10:07,336
Well, I hope you have
some way on how to find him,

191
00:10:07,338 --> 00:10:10,272
because I am running out
of places to look and people to ask.

192
00:10:10,274 --> 00:10:13,742
I know who to ask.

193
00:10:19,316 --> 00:10:21,817
Thanks for agreeing to see us.

194
00:10:21,819 --> 00:10:24,053
Mr. Diggle.

195
00:10:24,055 --> 00:10:27,623
Thought I made it clear
after our last meeting.

196
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:30,159
As far as A.R.G.U.S. is concerned,
you're out of favors.

197
00:10:30,161 --> 00:10:32,995
I'm not asking
for myself, Amanda.

198
00:10:32,997 --> 00:10:35,898
I'm asking for everyone
in Starling City.

199
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,267
I need you
to find Oliver Queen.

200
00:10:38,292 --> 00:10:42,292

Dig.

203
00:10:49,866 --> 00:10:51,299
That computer's running
an XK-15 processor.

204
00:10:51,301 --> 00:10:52,235
Felicity...

205
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:53,876
But that's not even
supposed to exist yet.

206
00:10:54,037 --> 00:10:55,370
I want one.

207
00:10:55,372 --> 00:10:56,704
Let me know
what you find.

208
00:10:56,706 --> 00:10:58,172
I don't have time
to keep track

209
00:10:58,174 --> 00:10:59,474
of your friends,
Mr. Diggle.

210
00:10:59,476 --> 00:11:01,175
We deal with
more pressing issues here.

211
00:11:01,177 --> 00:11:02,777
You don't understand.
Oliver's disappeared.

212
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:04,078
Maybe he needs
some time.

213
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,481
Or is it possible
that the two of you

214
00:11:06,483 --> 00:11:08,116
simply haven't been looking in
the right place?

215
00:11:08,118 --> 00:11:09,984
Did you try facial
recognition?

216
00:11:09,986 --> 00:11:11,552
Yes, I ran it three times.

217
00:11:11,554 --> 00:11:13,721
Amanda, please.

218
00:11:13,723 --> 00:11:18,026
Slade Wilson has an army
of men just like him.

219
00:11:18,028 --> 00:11:20,595
How many men have been exposed
to the Mirakuru?

220
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:22,063
Enough to lay waste
to this city.

221
00:11:22,065 --> 00:11:23,698
We need to find Oliver
right now.

222
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,767
I'll see what I can do.

223
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,035
Have you
heard from Sara?

224
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:27,736
No.

225
00:11:27,737 --> 00:11:30,571
Can you just call Mandy and see if
she can cover the bar?

226
00:11:34,943 --> 00:11:36,744
Isabel Rochev.

227
00:11:36,746 --> 00:11:39,414
I know who you are.

228
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,849
What can I do
for you, Ms. Rochev?

229
00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:43,785
I'm sorry for
your loss, Thea.

230
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:46,454
Is that why you came here?

231
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:49,157
Offer me your condolences?

232
00:11:50,492 --> 00:11:52,260
My condolences,

233
00:11:52,262 --> 00:11:54,462
and to give you this.
It's a notice

234
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,464
to vacate the premises.

235
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:59,801
This club and the steel factory
in which its located

236
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:01,936
are all assets
of Queen Consolidated.

237
00:12:01,938 --> 00:12:04,972
No, you--you can't do this.
It's already done.

238
00:12:08,544 --> 00:12:11,145
How long do I have?

239
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,880
A couple days.

240
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:24,726
Councilman Tyson
is asking about dinner.

241
00:12:24,728 --> 00:12:26,194
I already have
plans tonight.

242
00:12:26,196 --> 00:12:29,697
Hi. Excuse me,
I didn't mean to barge in.

243
00:12:29,699 --> 00:12:31,999
It's just that nobody
was at your front desk, so...

244
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:34,302
Laurel, of course,
please come in.

245
00:12:34,304 --> 00:12:36,370
Give us a moment.

246
00:12:36,372 --> 00:12:37,972
Twice in two days.

247
00:12:37,974 --> 00:12:39,440
To what do I owe
the pleasure?

248
00:12:39,442 --> 00:12:41,743
I wish I could say
that this was pleasure,

249
00:12:41,745 --> 00:12:43,678
but it's about a case.

250
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,980
I've barely moved in and people
are already asking me for favors.

251
00:12:45,982 --> 00:12:47,515
I guess I really
have arrived.

252
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:50,418
You certainly have.

253
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,353
So tell me,
how can I help you?

254
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,889
Murphy vs. Dunleavy.

255
00:12:54,891 --> 00:12:56,791
The state's charged
a real estate developer

256
00:12:56,793 --> 00:12:58,659
for turning away
low-income tenants

257
00:12:58,661 --> 00:13:00,762
based on his so-called
"morality."

258
00:13:00,764 --> 00:13:03,998
Have a seat.
Let me guess.

259
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,167
Our dear fair
housing commissioner

260
00:13:06,169 --> 00:13:08,536
isn't willing to testify
as your expert witness.

261
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:10,471
Exactly.
And your predecessor

262
00:13:10,473 --> 00:13:12,073
wasn't willing to lean on him.

263
00:13:12,075 --> 00:13:14,876
Well, lucky for you,
I'm not my predecessor.

264
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:18,112
You know, this actually
reminds me of one I had

265
00:13:18,114 --> 00:13:20,248
during my days
as a community organizer.

266
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,916
I was hoping that it would.

267
00:13:21,918 --> 00:13:25,219
I've seen dozens
of cases like this at CNRI.

268
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,288
Well, it's a good thing we both
remember where we came from.

269
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:29,023
I'm happy to help.

270
00:13:29,025 --> 00:13:30,725
Thank you.

271
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:34,095
Laurel...

272
00:13:34,097 --> 00:13:37,131
I'm really glad you
got your job back at the DA's office.

273
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:40,034
I look forward to us
working together for a long time.

274
00:13:40,036 --> 00:13:41,836
As do I.

275
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:50,378
Is it working?

276
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:53,748
We're about to remote access
the computer right now.

277
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,683
I'll tell you this,
if you ever

278
00:13:55,685 --> 00:13:56,951
get tired of
practicing law,

279
00:13:56,953 --> 00:13:58,252
you'd make a pretty
decent spy.

280
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,054
You guys have a warrant
for this, right?

281
00:14:00,056 --> 00:14:01,856
Just...

282
00:14:01,858 --> 00:14:03,724
Terrific.

283
00:14:03,726 --> 00:14:05,626
Could you at least
tell me who's computer you bugged?

284
00:14:07,697 --> 00:14:10,431
You're kidding.
I voted for him.

285
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,266
Yeah.
I need to know

286
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,569
if there's anything
incriminating in Blood's files.

287
00:14:14,571 --> 00:14:18,272
What the hell, this is
a dead end job, anyway.

288
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,641
This all looks
pretty benign.

289
00:14:20,643 --> 00:14:22,577
Lots of policy papers,

290
00:14:22,579 --> 00:14:26,581
old documents transferred from
his campaign office.

291
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,416
Draft press releases...

292
00:14:28,418 --> 00:14:30,618
Wait, wait, wait,
click back.

293
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,887
"For immediate release--
my thoughts and prayers

294
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:34,822
are with the Queen family
in the aftermath

295
00:14:34,824 --> 00:14:37,391
of this unspeakable tragedy.

296
00:14:37,393 --> 00:14:39,560
So he worked up a press release
after Moira was killed.

297
00:14:39,562 --> 00:14:41,362
No, he didn't.
He wrote that

298
00:14:41,364 --> 00:14:43,497
the day before
Moira died.

299
00:14:43,499 --> 00:14:47,468
She's right.
Look at the timestamp.

300
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,036
Oh, my God.

301
00:14:49,038 --> 00:14:51,205
Sebastian knew Slade
was going to kill her.

302
00:14:52,908 --> 00:14:55,009
Is that the satellite
frequency communicator

303
00:14:55,011 --> 00:14:57,578
TX50?

304
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,113
Can I touch it?

305
00:14:59,115 --> 00:15:01,249
I know that sounds
a little weird and creepy,

306
00:15:01,251 --> 00:15:02,817
but I've never seen
one in real life.

307
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:05,653
It's classified equipment,
Ms. Smoak.

308
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:08,589
You must feel
very powerful...

309
00:15:08,591 --> 00:15:10,625
Knowing everything
about everyone.

310
00:15:10,627 --> 00:15:13,261
Not powerful in an evil
dictator Stalin way.

311
00:15:13,263 --> 00:15:17,231
More of a...
Knowledge is power, way.

312
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:19,934
Ma'am.
We have something.

313
00:15:19,936 --> 00:15:22,470
I should have known.

314
00:15:22,472 --> 00:15:23,671
What?

315
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:24,906
Oliver's at the lair

316
00:15:24,908 --> 00:15:26,674
from which he conducts
his operations.

317
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,209
But we were
just there.

318
00:15:28,211 --> 00:15:30,378
Not that lair.

319
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,847
His other one.

320
00:15:39,721 --> 00:15:42,323
Like riding bicycle.

321
00:15:42,325 --> 00:15:45,192
Underwater.

322
00:15:53,303 --> 00:15:54,769
What's that sound?

323
00:15:54,771 --> 00:15:56,804
We're stuck.

324
00:15:59,808 --> 00:16:01,709
Like
Japanese were.

325
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:03,678
Submarines have
torpedoes, right?

326
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,680
Can we blast our way out?

327
00:16:05,682 --> 00:16:07,315
I can see why you two
are made for each other.

328
00:16:07,317 --> 00:16:09,550
You like
your explosions.

329
00:16:18,293 --> 00:16:20,561
Chert voz'mi.

330
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:21,529
What?

331
00:16:21,531 --> 00:16:23,397
These are Kaiten
torpedoes.

332
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,800
Manually operated.

333
00:16:25,802 --> 00:16:27,902
Someone needs to
steer from inside.

334
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:31,605
Okay, but then, how do they
get away from the explosion?

335
00:16:31,607 --> 00:16:34,041
They do not.

336
00:16:42,884 --> 00:16:46,053
Oliver.

337
00:16:51,994 --> 00:16:53,423
How did you find me?

338
00:16:53,448 --> 00:16:54,496
Waller.

339
00:16:54,497 --> 00:16:56,130
We were worried
about you.

340
00:16:56,132 --> 00:16:57,832
After you missed
your mother's funeral.

341
00:16:57,834 --> 00:17:00,801
I'm sorry that I didn't go.

342
00:17:02,653 --> 00:17:04,359
I left for the cemetery.

343
00:17:04,807 --> 00:17:08,209
But I ended up here.

344
00:17:08,211 --> 00:17:09,610
Here is...

345
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:12,013
Here was a secondary facility

346
00:17:12,015 --> 00:17:14,615
in case the foundry
was compromised.

347
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:19,653
But it became somewhere
that I could just go and...

348
00:17:19,655 --> 00:17:22,390
Be alone.

349
00:17:26,061 --> 00:17:28,696
She's dead
because of me.

350
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:35,970
Five years ago...

351
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:39,440
I could have cured Slade.

352
00:17:39,442 --> 00:17:41,175
And that would have
prevented all of this.

353
00:17:41,177 --> 00:17:44,211
And now,

354
00:17:44,213 --> 00:17:48,716
all the people left
that I care about,

355
00:17:48,718 --> 00:17:51,352
we are all
in his crosshairs.

356
00:17:51,354 --> 00:17:54,121
It ends tonight.

357
00:17:54,123 --> 00:17:56,857
How?

358
00:17:56,859 --> 00:18:00,261
I turn myself over to Slade.

359
00:18:00,263 --> 00:18:03,330
I end this vendetta.

360
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,232
Oliver,
you think this ends

361
00:18:05,234 --> 00:18:08,569
with you turning
yourself over to Slade?

362
00:18:08,571 --> 00:18:11,238
Yes, I do.

363
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,542
After she was gone...

364
00:18:14,544 --> 00:18:19,547
He told that
one more person had to die.

365
00:18:22,006 --> 00:18:24,398
And then it would end.

366
00:18:25,754 --> 00:18:29,824
This ends for Slade
when he kills me.

367
00:18:29,826 --> 00:18:31,725
I don't accept that.

368
00:18:31,727 --> 00:18:33,260
You shouldn't,
either.

369
00:18:33,262 --> 00:18:35,763
You can't just accept
things, Oliver.

370
00:18:35,765 --> 00:18:37,998
If I had accepted
my life, I would be

371
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,067
a cocktail waitress in
Vegas like my mother,

372
00:18:40,069 --> 00:18:41,735
and I never would
have gone to college,

373
00:18:41,737 --> 00:18:43,404
and I never would have moved
a thousand miles away

374
00:18:43,406 --> 00:18:45,539
to work at Queen Consolidated,
and I never would have

375
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,174
believed some
crazy guy in a hood

376
00:18:47,176 --> 00:18:49,337
when he told me I could be
more than just some IT girl.

377
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:55,242
Please don't do this.

378
00:18:57,512 --> 00:19:00,681
Felicity...

379
00:19:00,683 --> 00:19:03,579
Someone once told me

380
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:07,210
that the essence of heroism
is to die so others can live.

381
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,986
It's not that
simple, Oliver.

382
00:19:08,988 --> 00:19:11,756
Yes, it is.

383
00:19:11,758 --> 00:19:15,359
Slade's whole plan

384
00:19:15,361 --> 00:19:18,963
was to take everything from me.

385
00:19:20,044 --> 00:19:22,678
He did.

386
00:19:23,123 --> 00:19:24,886
He wins.

387
00:19:27,427 --> 00:19:30,829
All that's left
is for me to die.

388
00:19:32,731 --> 00:19:36,668
No, there has to be
another way.

389
00:19:42,441 --> 00:19:44,676
There isn't.

390
00:19:55,311 --> 00:19:58,039
Thea, please.
I understand you're upset.

391
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,140
This is an emotional time
for all of us.

392
00:20:00,142 --> 00:20:01,542
I'm not being
emotional.

393
00:20:01,544 --> 00:20:04,011
I'm...I'm an orphan!

394
00:20:04,013 --> 00:20:07,448
I'm a jobless
and homeless orphan.

395
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:09,950
There's nothing
left for me here.

396
00:20:09,952 --> 00:20:11,252
I'm here.

397
00:20:11,254 --> 00:20:14,088
I thank you
for that, but...

398
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:16,991
Honestly, I need
to start over.

399
00:20:20,195 --> 00:20:23,697
Oliver.

400
00:20:23,699 --> 00:20:25,766
We missed you at the funeral.

401
00:20:25,768 --> 00:20:27,535
And the reception.

402
00:20:27,537 --> 00:20:30,271
I'm sorry that I
couldn't be there.

403
00:20:30,273 --> 00:20:33,107
What's
going on here?

404
00:20:33,109 --> 00:20:35,209
Thea's thinking
of leaving Starling City.

405
00:20:35,211 --> 00:20:38,345
No, I am leaving.

406
00:20:38,347 --> 00:20:42,283
Walter, could I speak to
my sister for a moment?

407
00:20:42,285 --> 00:20:44,485
I'm sure you'll have
better luck.

408
00:20:47,556 --> 00:20:50,991
Ollie, please.
Just don't even try

409
00:20:50,993 --> 00:20:53,060
to convince me to stay.

410
00:20:53,062 --> 00:20:56,363
I won't. I think
it's a good idea.

411
00:20:56,365 --> 00:20:59,667
You should get
as far from Starling City

412
00:20:59,669 --> 00:21:02,036
as you possibly can.

413
00:21:02,038 --> 00:21:04,305
In our family,

414
00:21:04,307 --> 00:21:07,241
out of you, me,
mom and dad,

415
00:21:07,243 --> 00:21:11,178
you are the best of us.

416
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,781
You have
the purest heart.

417
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:18,652
And I can't ever
have you lose that.

418
00:21:18,654 --> 00:21:20,054
Ok?

419
00:21:20,056 --> 00:21:21,589
You promise me?

420
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:24,592
Ok.

421
00:21:31,066 --> 00:21:34,969
I know that I haven't always
been the best brother,

422
00:21:34,971 --> 00:21:40,240
or friend, or whatever
you've needed me to be.

423
00:21:40,242 --> 00:21:44,211
But there has not
been a day since you were born

424
00:21:44,213 --> 00:21:49,550
where I didn't cherish having
you as a sister.

425
00:21:53,888 --> 00:21:55,456
I'll, um,

426
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:59,360
get in touch when
I get settled somewhere.

427
00:22:18,346 --> 00:22:21,749
It's Oliver.

428
00:22:21,751 --> 00:22:25,319
This ends now.

429
00:22:25,321 --> 00:22:28,756
I'll be at the pier,
I'll be alone.

430
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:38,065
I'll do it.

431
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,001
Peter, you'll die.

432
00:22:41,003 --> 00:22:43,537
I'm already dead.

433
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:49,743
Radiation poisoning.

434
00:22:49,745 --> 00:22:52,046
Ivo's little gift.

435
00:22:52,048 --> 00:22:55,816
He said he needed to find out
if Mirakuru could cure cancer.

436
00:22:55,818 --> 00:22:58,252
Guess we'll
never find out.

437
00:22:58,254 --> 00:23:00,354
Oh, I'm sorry, Peter,
I didn't know.

438
00:23:00,356 --> 00:23:04,792
Ivo said the essence of heroism
is to die so that others can live.

439
00:23:04,794 --> 00:23:07,127
I held on to that.

440
00:23:07,129 --> 00:23:10,130
It's the only thing
that gave me hope.

441
00:23:10,132 --> 00:23:11,865
So I'll go.

442
00:23:11,867 --> 00:23:14,034
I mean, I may not
be saving millions of lives,

443
00:23:14,036 --> 00:23:15,803
but I'll be
saving yours.

444
00:23:26,448 --> 00:23:29,583
This is where
it all started.

445
00:23:29,585 --> 00:23:33,721
Got on the "Queen's Gambit"
right over there.

446
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:39,860
I should have died
on that boat.

447
00:23:39,862 --> 00:23:43,630
If I had, none of this
would have happened.

448
00:23:43,632 --> 00:23:47,468
I never would have met you.

449
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:51,438
Shado and my mother
would still be alive.

450
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:58,946
No one else is going
to die because of me.

451
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:04,752
Aah!

452
00:24:21,002 --> 00:24:24,071
Diggle, what the hell?

453
00:24:35,179 --> 00:24:38,781
Slade Wilson.

454
00:24:38,783 --> 00:24:40,350
He told me
who you were.

455
00:24:40,352 --> 00:24:42,618
Did he hurt you?

456
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,020
No.

457
00:24:44,022 --> 00:24:45,755
He was trying
to hurt you.

458
00:24:45,757 --> 00:24:48,358
And when
you went missing,

459
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,859
I reached out...

460
00:24:49,861 --> 00:24:53,129
to your partners.

461
00:24:53,131 --> 00:24:54,764
They told me what you
were planning on doing.

462
00:24:54,766 --> 00:24:56,599
It's what I have to do.

463
00:24:56,601 --> 00:24:59,268
Will you give us
a moment?

464
00:25:10,647 --> 00:25:13,416
You thought about
telling me...

465
00:25:13,418 --> 00:25:16,953
The night
of the Undertaking.

466
00:25:16,955 --> 00:25:20,123
I thought about telling you
almost every night.

467
00:25:21,959 --> 00:25:24,560
Why didn't you?

468
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:28,364
Tommy knew.

469
00:25:28,366 --> 00:25:30,800
Didn't he?

470
00:25:30,802 --> 00:25:32,802
You were with him.

471
00:25:32,804 --> 00:25:35,171
You were with him
at the end.

472
00:25:35,173 --> 00:25:37,173
His last words
were about you.

473
00:25:37,175 --> 00:25:39,675
He wanted to know
if you were safe.

474
00:25:39,677 --> 00:25:43,312
Sorry I couldn't
save him.

475
00:25:43,314 --> 00:25:46,182
And my mother.

476
00:25:48,152 --> 00:25:51,220
But I can save you.

477
00:25:51,222 --> 00:25:53,823
And Thea.

478
00:25:53,825 --> 00:25:57,727
I can save the city
if this ends tonight.

479
00:25:57,729 --> 00:25:59,495
No.

480
00:25:59,497 --> 00:26:01,697
No!

481
00:26:01,699 --> 00:26:04,200
You can't commit
suicide, Ollie.

482
00:26:04,202 --> 00:26:06,035
You won't do that to me.

483
00:26:06,037 --> 00:26:08,337
Or to Sara,
or to your friends.

484
00:26:08,339 --> 00:26:11,007
Or to Thea.
Oliver...

485
00:26:11,009 --> 00:26:13,176
She just lost
her mother.

486
00:26:13,178 --> 00:26:16,212
Losing you
would destroy her.

487
00:26:16,214 --> 00:26:18,648
But she'll be alive.

488
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:22,718
I don't know anything about hoods
and masks or human weapons

489
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,887
or any of this.

490
00:26:24,889 --> 00:26:27,990
But I know you.

491
00:26:27,992 --> 00:26:30,193
I know you like
I know my own name.

492
00:26:30,195 --> 00:26:32,495
And I realize it may
sound crazy in light of your secret,

493
00:26:32,497 --> 00:26:36,532
but I know who you are
in your bones, Oliver.

494
00:26:36,534 --> 00:26:38,067
And that person--

495
00:26:38,069 --> 00:26:40,103
that person
doesn't give up.

496
00:26:40,105 --> 00:26:44,107
That person,
he always finds a way.

497
00:26:44,109 --> 00:26:47,076
Not this time.

498
00:26:47,078 --> 00:26:49,579
You're wrong.

499
00:26:49,581 --> 00:26:52,448
You want to protect
the people who you love?

500
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:55,751
Then the only way
to do that is to stop Slade Wilson.

501
00:26:55,753 --> 00:26:57,386
Laurel, I can't!
Yes, you can!

502
00:26:57,388 --> 00:26:59,822
By stopping Sebastian Blood,
because Sebastian

503
00:26:59,824 --> 00:27:02,258
is working
with Slade Wilson.

504
00:27:07,464 --> 00:27:09,866
I have proof.

505
00:27:09,868 --> 00:27:11,868
Slade Wilson
killed your mother

506
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:14,937
so that Sebastian
could become mayor.

507
00:27:17,808 --> 00:27:20,576
You were right about him.

508
00:27:22,045 --> 00:27:27,216
The man in the skull mask
works for Slade Wilson.

509
00:27:27,218 --> 00:27:29,952
And this entire time,

510
00:27:29,954 --> 00:27:32,955
it was Sebastian.

511
00:27:39,129 --> 00:27:41,664
What's happening

512
00:27:41,666 --> 00:27:44,800
is bigger
than you and Slade.

513
00:27:44,802 --> 00:27:48,304
This city needs
the Arrow.

514
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:02,418
What's this for?

515
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,920
I don't want you
to be in here.

516
00:28:03,922 --> 00:28:05,955
No, I'm going to stay with you--
Sara.

517
00:28:05,957 --> 00:28:07,657
If this doesn't work,

518
00:28:07,659 --> 00:28:09,926
I need you to be safe.

519
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:16,432
We will come for you
when it's over.

520
00:28:16,434 --> 00:28:18,801
Ok.

521
00:28:22,272 --> 00:28:26,309
Do you know how
the torpedo works?

522
00:28:26,311 --> 00:28:30,279
I get in, he fires,
I steer, you pray.

523
00:28:30,281 --> 00:28:32,315
Peter, what
you're doing is...

524
00:28:32,317 --> 00:28:33,816
Practical.

525
00:28:33,818 --> 00:28:35,651
My time's already up.

526
00:28:35,653 --> 00:28:37,954
Brave.

527
00:28:37,956 --> 00:28:40,189
You need to know that.

528
00:28:40,191 --> 00:28:42,725
And I don't think that I could do
something like this.

529
00:28:42,727 --> 00:28:45,294
You have. What you did for us--

530
00:28:45,296 --> 00:28:48,264
coming back to that boat,
setting us free?

531
00:28:48,266 --> 00:28:51,000
I came back to the boat
because I want to go home.

532
00:28:51,002 --> 00:28:54,103
I wasn't thinking
about saving anybody.

533
00:28:54,105 --> 00:28:55,838
It's...It's not
who I am.

534
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,275
Maybe not yet.

535
00:29:17,628 --> 00:29:19,895
Go?
Is Sara clear?

536
00:29:19,897 --> 00:29:22,365
Yes.
Yes.

537
00:29:48,058 --> 00:29:50,993
Hello. Good
to see you.

538
00:29:50,995 --> 00:29:53,529
Clinton. You can
wait in the car.

539
00:29:53,531 --> 00:29:55,064
Are you sure
that's a good idea?

540
00:29:55,066 --> 00:29:57,500
Nothing's going
to happen to me here.

541
00:29:57,502 --> 00:29:59,035
How are you doing,
Mr. Mayor?

542
00:29:59,037 --> 00:30:00,803
Hi. Good to see you,
good to see you.

543
00:30:00,805 --> 00:30:02,204
Congratulations, mayor Blood.

544
00:30:02,206 --> 00:30:03,406
Thank you.

545
00:30:03,408 --> 00:30:04,573
Mayor Blood, hello!

546
00:30:04,575 --> 00:30:05,941
Hi.

547
00:30:05,943 --> 00:30:07,743
We're all behind you,
Sebastian.

548
00:30:07,745 --> 00:30:09,879
Nice to see you.

549
00:30:09,881 --> 00:30:13,215
Sebastian,
may I join you for dinner?

550
00:30:21,459 --> 00:30:24,794
Hey,
can you hold that?

551
00:30:24,796 --> 00:30:31,567
Oh, thanks a lot,
man, appreciate it.

552
00:30:33,771 --> 00:30:36,439
Clinton Hogue.

553
00:30:36,441 --> 00:30:40,042
I have some
questions for you.

554
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:44,780
Go to hell.

555
00:30:44,782 --> 00:30:46,482
You sure that's how
you want to play it?

556
00:30:46,484 --> 00:30:49,452
You think I've never
took a beating before?

557
00:30:50,854 --> 00:30:53,456
Pal, you're going
to wish I beat you.

558
00:30:53,458 --> 00:30:56,525
Hi.

559
00:30:56,527 --> 00:30:58,527
I'll be
your interrogator.

560
00:30:58,529 --> 00:31:00,429
Is this a joke?
Clinton Hogue.

561
00:31:00,431 --> 00:31:03,432
Social Security
number 306003894.

562
00:31:03,434 --> 00:31:04,800
What the hell's
this supposed to be?

563
00:31:04,802 --> 00:31:06,869
Oh, look at this.

564
00:31:06,871 --> 00:31:09,772
You have a bank account
in the Cayman Islands.

565
00:31:10,841 --> 00:31:12,775
Wow.

566
00:31:12,777 --> 00:31:15,911
$2 million, quite
the little nest egg.

567
00:31:15,913 --> 00:31:18,180
But...Looks like you just

568
00:31:18,182 --> 00:31:21,617
approved a wire transfer of $1 million
to a charity here in Starling City.

569
00:31:21,619 --> 00:31:24,286
Very generous.

570
00:31:24,288 --> 00:31:25,888
What should I do with the rest?

571
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:28,324
Greenpeace.
Great cause!

572
00:31:28,326 --> 00:31:31,961
And they really
appreciate the support.

573
00:31:31,963 --> 00:31:33,129
You bitch!

574
00:31:33,131 --> 00:31:34,663
Bitch with WiFi.

575
00:31:34,665 --> 00:31:37,066
Hey, Clinton, looks like
your mom and dad have

576
00:31:37,068 --> 00:31:39,201
a really nice
retirement portfolio, too,

577
00:31:39,203 --> 00:31:41,462
but they, oh, no, are just

578
00:31:41,487 --> 00:31:43,447
about to make some really
bad investments.

579
00:31:43,674 --> 00:31:46,876
Ok, wait, just
wait--just--stop!

580
00:31:47,811 --> 00:31:51,013
What do you want to know?

581
00:31:52,349 --> 00:31:53,749
I missed you

582
00:31:53,751 --> 00:31:55,117
at your mother's
memorial service.

583
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:58,087
I wanted to offer
my condolences.

584
00:31:58,089 --> 00:32:00,389
You're the mayor.

585
00:32:00,391 --> 00:32:02,892
Congratulations.

586
00:32:02,894 --> 00:32:04,994
You've always wanted that.

587
00:32:04,996 --> 00:32:08,898
Believe me, Oliver, I wish it
had happened a different way.

588
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,901
Your mother and I,
we--we didn't agree on much.

589
00:32:11,903 --> 00:32:15,070
But we both wanted
what was best for Starling City.

590
00:32:15,072 --> 00:32:19,308
I will help this city find its
heart again, I promise you that.

591
00:32:20,911 --> 00:32:23,813
Do you really think that he...

592
00:32:23,815 --> 00:32:26,615
Will let that happen?

593
00:32:28,018 --> 00:32:30,219
Slade Wilson.

594
00:32:35,892 --> 00:32:39,228
How do you know
I've been working with Slade Wilson?

595
00:32:41,131 --> 00:32:44,667
Because I'm the Arrow.

596
00:32:47,238 --> 00:32:50,039
Of course.

597
00:32:50,041 --> 00:32:52,675
It all makes sense now.

598
00:32:52,677 --> 00:32:55,344
It was right
in front of me.

599
00:32:58,181 --> 00:33:01,684
You came to my office
and you shook my hand.

600
00:33:01,686 --> 00:33:03,552
You said that together,
we can save this city.

601
00:33:03,554 --> 00:33:05,955
You think that there will
be a city to be saved

602
00:33:05,957 --> 00:33:10,025
after you unleash Slade's
Mirakuru army?

603
00:33:10,027 --> 00:33:13,362
They'll only cause enough
damage to make the city ready.

604
00:33:13,364 --> 00:33:15,464
Ready for your leadership?

605
00:33:15,466 --> 00:33:18,133
For my vision
of what this city could be.

606
00:33:18,135 --> 00:33:21,504
A better city.

607
00:33:21,506 --> 00:33:24,306
And after the storm
they're about to suffer,

608
00:33:24,308 --> 00:33:26,008
the people of Starling

609
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:29,712
will support
and follow me to that city.

610
00:33:29,714 --> 00:33:34,250
Whatever Slade promised you,
he will not deliver.

611
00:33:34,252 --> 00:33:37,453
He wants to hurt me.

612
00:33:37,455 --> 00:33:42,024
You are a pawn
in a much larger game.

613
00:33:44,561 --> 00:33:48,130
Slade promised me
city hall.

614
00:33:48,132 --> 00:33:49,465
And he delivered.

615
00:33:49,467 --> 00:33:52,201
He makes good
on his promises.

616
00:33:52,203 --> 00:33:56,205
I understand he made
you a promise, too.

617
00:34:01,811 --> 00:34:04,813
What are you going to do?

618
00:34:04,815 --> 00:34:07,116
You going to stab
the mayor

619
00:34:07,118 --> 00:34:10,553
in a restaurant
full of people?

620
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:17,860
It's a new day
in Starling City, Oliver.

621
00:34:17,862 --> 00:34:21,964
And there's nothing
you can do to stop it.

622
00:35:20,938 --> 00:35:22,448
Slade's men are
taking the city tonight.

623
00:35:22,449 --> 00:35:23,566
They can try.

624
00:35:23,591 --> 00:35:25,242
There's more men
than we thought,

625
00:35:25,243 --> 00:35:27,110
all on Mirakuru.
It could be a massacre.

626
00:35:27,112 --> 00:35:28,945
Not if we get to them first.

627
00:35:28,947 --> 00:35:31,714
We stick to the plan,
no matter what.

628
00:35:31,716 --> 00:35:33,716
Slade's using the sewer system.

629
00:35:33,718 --> 00:35:36,015
You can drop in at Rock Avenue
and then head southeast.

630
00:35:36,016 --> 00:35:37,891
The lines converge
at Water Street.

631
00:35:37,892 --> 00:35:39,492
If Slade's army's underground,
that's probably where he'll be.

632
00:35:39,494 --> 00:35:41,894
Good. Let's go.
Diggle, you ready?

633
00:35:41,896 --> 00:35:43,396
Never not.

634
00:35:43,398 --> 00:35:44,764
I'm coming, too.

635
00:35:44,766 --> 00:35:47,299
No, you're not.

636
00:35:47,301 --> 00:35:48,768
Felicity can
give me a radio.

637
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:50,169
I'll just be your
eyes and your ears.

638
00:35:50,171 --> 00:35:51,637
I'll stay out of
your way, I promise.

639
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:54,607
Nothing will happen to me.
What if it did?

640
00:35:54,609 --> 00:35:57,710
Slade's men, one on one, they
are nearly impossible to stop.

641
00:35:57,712 --> 00:35:59,445
I need you to trust me.

642
00:35:59,447 --> 00:36:02,548
And I need you to be safe.

643
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:05,484
But not them?

644
00:36:06,586 --> 00:36:10,289
This started
with the three of us.

645
00:36:10,291 --> 00:36:13,692
It's time
we got back to that.

646
00:37:07,647 --> 00:37:10,749
Tonight we forge
a new history.

647
00:37:10,751 --> 00:37:13,419
Tonight
we rise up as one

648
00:37:13,421 --> 00:37:15,154
and take back
this city.

649
00:37:15,156 --> 00:37:18,157
I have eyes on
Blood's army.

650
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:20,593
Got it. I'm forwarding
Dig your ping

651
00:37:20,595 --> 00:37:23,128
along with the foundation schematics
of the Topside Avenue.

652
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:24,864
Follow the route
I laid out on the blueprints.

653
00:37:24,866 --> 00:37:27,333
You'll see structural
joints in the concrete.

654
00:37:29,669 --> 00:37:32,204
Blow them all
and Blood gets buried.

655
00:37:32,206 --> 00:37:34,139
Got it.

656
00:37:43,083 --> 00:37:45,451
The market
opened today at 400 points

657
00:37:45,453 --> 00:37:48,988
thanks in part to the surprise rally
of Queen's Consolidated.

658
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:51,490
New leadership has--

659
00:37:51,492 --> 00:37:53,759
...the company's future in spite
of this recent tragedy.

660
00:37:53,761 --> 00:37:57,029
Um, excuse me,
why can't I board my train?

661
00:37:57,031 --> 00:37:59,198
I'm sorry, ma'am, it's just
business class right now.

662
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,666
Coach will be boarding soon.

663
00:38:00,668 --> 00:38:03,502
Ok.

664
00:38:03,504 --> 00:38:05,170
Come on, pal.

665
00:38:05,172 --> 00:38:07,840
Isn't that one
of the Iron Heights escapees?

666
00:38:07,842 --> 00:38:09,775
Dumbass here tried to rob
a convenience store

667
00:38:09,777 --> 00:38:11,710
but gave up as soon
as I pulled in.

668
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:13,078
Mind if I just stick him
here for a minute?

669
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,080
No, go ahead.

670
00:38:17,183 --> 00:38:18,817
I'm just asking here.

671
00:38:18,819 --> 00:38:22,054
Oliver, you've worked
really hard not to kill anymore.

672
00:38:22,056 --> 00:38:24,523
Dropping an entire block
on these guys is murder.

673
00:38:24,525 --> 00:38:26,759
Manslaughter, at least.

674
00:38:26,761 --> 00:38:28,227
They're not men.

675
00:38:28,229 --> 00:38:30,896
Not anymore.

676
00:38:34,401 --> 00:38:37,903
Have Diggle blow the charges
the moment he's ready.

677
00:38:37,905 --> 00:38:39,705
Oliver?

678
00:38:50,016 --> 00:38:52,885
We will lead this city
out of the darkness,

679
00:38:52,887 --> 00:38:56,121
and each one
of you will help me.

680
00:39:37,565 --> 00:39:39,800
Come on.

681
00:39:44,233 --> 00:39:46,768
Oliver, where
the hell are you?!

682
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:56,578
You killed me...

683
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:59,681
Let me return
the favor.

684
00:39:59,683 --> 00:40:02,784
Hey.

685
00:40:02,786 --> 00:40:04,986
You got the time?

686
00:40:04,988 --> 00:40:08,156
It's, uh, 9:00.

687
00:40:08,158 --> 00:40:10,025
Thanks.

688
00:40:37,653 --> 00:40:40,488
Oliver, please.

689
00:40:44,293 --> 00:40:48,797
Cisco, now is really
not a good time.

690
00:40:54,204 --> 00:40:56,271
There.

691
00:40:59,742 --> 00:41:01,676
Ollie!

692
00:41:01,678 --> 00:41:03,445
There's too many
of them!

693
00:41:03,447 --> 00:41:05,614
We can't fight.

694
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:09,718
We're not going to.

695
00:41:16,359 --> 00:41:19,027
Turn the wheel!

696
00:41:19,029 --> 00:41:20,996
What direction?

697
00:41:20,998 --> 00:41:22,897
It does not matter.
Just turn the wheel.

698
00:41:25,435 --> 00:41:28,303
I can't!
That is not an option.

699
00:41:30,373 --> 00:41:32,440
I got it!

700
00:41:32,442 --> 00:41:34,609
We're moving!

701
00:41:34,611 --> 00:41:36,611
Good, good.

702
00:41:38,547 --> 00:41:41,583
Sara, we did it.

703
00:41:41,585 --> 00:41:44,052
Sara!

704
00:41:44,054 --> 00:41:46,154
Oliver!

705
00:41:51,179 --> 00:41:56,179
