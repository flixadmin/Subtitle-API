with a bright future
ahead of her.

168
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:44,738
Why would you risk it all

169
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,448
by getting involved with
a vigilante like Peter Parker?

170

Absolutely.

to say anything to you.

175

Not even a thing.
I just have one question.

176
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:03,006
When MJ told you
Peter was Spider-Man...

177
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,800
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Heh.
What's up?

178
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:06,426
I-I knew way before MJ did.

179
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,761
I was Spider-Man's
"guy in the chair."

180
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:09,179
I know about those.

181
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:10,931
Dude, half my guys
are guys in the chair.

182
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,432
Exactly. You would know.

183
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:14,893
I literally helped him
find the Vulture.

184
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:17,145
I didn't know that.
I helped him hack a suit once

185
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:18,814
and helped him get to space.

186
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:21,190
So in Spider-Man's
illegal vigilantism,

187
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:23,360
you were his main accomplice.

188

stricken from the record.

I mean that very insincerely,

specific charges to throw at us,

A boy was entrusted to you,

and as his legal guardian,
essentially his mother,

196

you not only allowed him
to endanger himself,

197

but you actually encouraged it.

So, what is this place?

496
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,648
The Sanctum's built
at the intersection

497
00:22:36,732 --> 00:22:38,609

498

We weren't the first
to seek them out.

499

Some of these walls
are thousands of years old.

The Equalizer here in the '80s.

Wait, excuse me?

510
00:23:15,354 --> 00:23:16,855
The entire world's
about to forget

511

That's not how the spell works.

515
00:23:26,198 --> 00:23:27,740
And it's very difficult
and dangerous

516

my girlfriend?

519

because you were Spider-Man?

He's my best friend

527
00:23:51,849 --> 00:23:53,934
so it's important to me
that Ned knows.

528
00:23:58,021 --> 00:24:01,692
Okay, let's not change
the parameters of this spell

2403
02:27:50,913 --> 02:27:53,457
Things just got out of hand.
