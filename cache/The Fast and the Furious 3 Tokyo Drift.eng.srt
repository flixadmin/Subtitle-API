1
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:09,356
Nice ride.

2
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:11,984
It does the job.

3
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:14,904
What job, delivering pizzas?

4
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:19,283
Well, it's not the ride, it's the rider.

5
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,956
- What the hell was that?
- What?

6
00:03:26,457 --> 00:03:28,834
Hey! You talking to my girl?

7
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:30,961
- Oh, shit. Here we go.
- Yeah.

8
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:34,298
She was just admiring my ride.

9
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:35,716
"My ride."

10
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:39,345
My grandma's Buick could smoke
that piece of shit, trailer trash.

11
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:42,056
Well, what about your daddy's Viper?

12
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:46,101
This beast's got 500 horsepower
and a Borla exhaust system.

13
00:03:46,185 --> 00:03:48,562
It does 0 to 60 in like 4.3 seconds...

14
00:03:48,646 --> 00:03:50,356
- That's about right. That's about right.
- Yeah.

15
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,775
Wow. You can read the brochure.

16
00:04:15,965 --> 00:04:18,801
What a pitch, baby. What a pitch.
I like that.

17
00:04:18,968 --> 00:04:21,095
What's he gonna do?

18
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:23,180
- Let's make it happen.
- Bring it.

19
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,359
I got your back.

20
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,781
Why don't you nice boys let your cars do the talking?

21
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:44,493
I only race for pink slips.

22
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:47,288
This car goes for 80 grand.

23
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:50,582
What would I do
with a broken-ass piece of shit like that?

24
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,422
How about me?

25
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:03,554
Winner gets me.

26
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:13,397
Cut it, let's out it. Let's go, go, go, go!

27
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:30,205
Blast-off, baby!

28
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,793
First one out the other side...

29
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:38,172
- It's time.
- Let's go!

30
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,674
- Ready, boys?
- Make it interesting, Clay.

31
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:25,636
Shit!

32
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:38,315
Yeah!

33
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:49,928
I thought you loved me.

34
00:07:58,228 --> 00:07:59,438
Oh, Well.

35
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:11,700
What the hell?

36
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:23,879
Guess I got a new date for prom.

37
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:35,933
- Clay, stop the car!
- Shut up!

38
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:46,944
- Clay, stop the car!
- Shut up!

39
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,278
Stop it!

40
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:54,952
Clay, please stop! Please stop!

41
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,150
Can I get a copy of that?

42
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:12,446
You think this is a joke, huh?

43
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:15,699
You see Ken and Barbie over there?

44
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:18,619
They're gonna walk out of here
without even a slap on the wrist.

45
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:21,163
Mommy and Daddy are too hooked up.

46
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,168
But I like screw-ups like you.

47
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:30,631
You know why?
'Cause you're 100% guaranteed conviction.

48
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:32,883
- Where's my car?
- I crushed it.

49
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:33,967
You did what?

50
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:35,135
- Sit down! You're done.
- Easy, easy.

51
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:36,553
You're done. You understand me?
You're done.

52
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:38,404
And all before your eighteenth birthday.
Now sit down.

53
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:42,851
Sean.

54
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:46,438
What the hell were you thinking, huh?

55
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:49,399
Mrs. Boswell? Please.

56
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:51,610
It's, um...

57
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:53,070
It's Miss.

58
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:59,743
Officer, is it illegal to smoke in here?

59
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:11,129
It's a tough state.
And it's a pretty clear-cut case.

60
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:15,467
He'll be lucky if they don't try him as an adult.

61
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:20,347
This is our third town in two years.

62
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:25,602
Your son's got two priors for reckless
driving, willful destruction of property.

63
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:27,646
This makes it strike three.

64
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:30,357
They're definitely gonna want to get him off the streets.

65
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,276
Well, there's just got to be another way.

66
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:44,496
So, where are we moving this time?

67
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:49,167
We are not moving anywhere.

68
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:45,492
Sean.

69
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:48,411
I thought you were gonna be here on the 7th.

70
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,121
Today is the 7th.

71
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,084
Well, look, just hold on one second.

72
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,778
Come on in.

73
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,159
This is it.

74
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:37,919
You know, Sean, I was gonna be there.

75
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:41,047
But your mom, she said the 7th, see,

76
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:43,758
and we're a day ahead of you in Japan.

77
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:48,972
Well, you're here now, and that's good.

78
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:52,642
So, how is your mom?

79
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:56,313
Where do I sleep?

80
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:59,357
Now, Sean, you know she had no other choice.

81
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:02,152
I mean, it was either this or juvi hall,

82
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:07,407
I mean, you just can't keep moving away
every time you get into trouble.

83
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,034
Worked for you.

84
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:14,831
Look, neither of us asked for this.

85
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:18,376
But I promised your mom I'd take care of you.

86
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:21,838
So you just go by the rules her and I agreed to,

87
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:24,966
- ...and I'm sure you'll manage just fine.
- Rules?

88
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:28,178
Yeah, rules. Real simple.

89
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,890
You go to school, you come back here right after.

90
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:36,019
And I don't want to see or hear
about you anywhere near a car.

91
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:40,315
Here, the bedroom is yours.

92
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,156
Make yourself comfortable.

93
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,243
Lights out in 10.

94
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:53,888
You got to be kidding.

95
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,073
- Wrong train.
- Huh?

96
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:54,657
I'm new here.

97
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,456
Boswell, yes, ma'am.

98
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,609
<i>Uwabaki.

99
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:04,519
Japanese food is like the Army.

100
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:07,021
Don't ask, don't tell.

101
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:11,693
Name's Twinkie.
Hey, I noticed you ain't have a laptop.

102
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:14,737
Yeah?

103
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:17,448
I'll hook you up. Half price.

104
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:19,993
No, I'm cool.

105
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:23,371
60% off.
Since we're both army brats and everything.

106
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:26,291
I ain't got no cash, man.

107
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:28,168
And I ain't an army brat.

108
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:31,588
All right, all right.
Well, what about a cell phone, huh?

109
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:34,465
Everybody needs a cell phone.

110
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:36,092
No offense,

111
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:40,180
but I'm probably not gonna be here
long enough to remember your name.

112
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:43,683
Then you gonna need some new shoes to book town with, man.

113
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:46,853
You like Michael Jordan?
I love Michael Jordan.

114
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:49,647
Check this out.

115
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:52,483
Brand new Jordans. Not even out yet.

116
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:55,778
LeBron James couldn't even get his hands on those.

117
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:59,991
You selling that Sparco steering wheel?

118
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:02,493
Hell, no. That's mine right there.

119
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:05,121
Man, I even paid retail for it.

120
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:07,165
What you drive?

121
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:08,708
- My ride?
- Yeah.

122
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,252
- My ride's one of a kind.
- Show me.

123
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:14,839
Thought you weren't sticking around.

124
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,799
All right.

125
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:11,771
Slamming, huh? Look at that car.

126
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:12,855
Ooh!

127
00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:15,692
At least let me drive.

128
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:18,236
Y'all better have some real cars around here.

129
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:21,698
Okay, I see
somebody got jokes, huh? Well, all right.

130
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:23,992
I don't know if you're ready for them, though.

131
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:26,119
You look a little nervous.

132
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:28,204
What up, Tosh?

133
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:05,074
For when you blow your wad, man.

134
00:23:02,632 --> 00:23:03,758
Hear that?

135
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:05,635
It's still not right for the way I drive.

136
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:08,429
'Cause the way you drive is wrong!
See?

137
00:23:08,513 --> 00:23:10,932
I don't need a computer
to tell me about my throttle response.

138
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:13,434
Okay. Then we're done here.

139
00:23:16,104 --> 00:23:18,898
You wouldn't have that problem with a V8.

140
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:20,817
Boys.

141
00:23:20,942 --> 00:23:24,278
All they care about is who's got the biggest engine.

142
00:23:24,946 --> 00:23:27,156
I'm a guy. It's in my DNA.

143
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:32,245
So y'all race with these things, huh?
Cute little toys.

144
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:37,125
You know, I almost didn't recognize you
without your slippers on.

145
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:39,127
<i>Don't you mean uwabaki?

146
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:41,796
Neela, right?

147
00:23:42,547 --> 00:23:44,465
You're a quick learner.

148
00:23:47,218 --> 00:23:48,928
So, where you from, anyway?

149
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:50,179
Here.

150
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:53,975
No, I mean, not where you live.
Where'd you come from?

151
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:56,352
Does it really matter where I'm from?

152
00:24:03,985 --> 00:24:05,653
Who's the tourist?

153
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:10,575
What's with you and the schoolgirls, D?

154
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:13,870
You're moving up in the world.
You gotta elevate your company.

155
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:17,039
Wednesday, Wednesday, meet Thursday.
God. Girl.

156
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:24,630
Ladies, hold that thought, all right?
All right, beautiful. Hold up.

157
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:28,384
He was just leaving.

158
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:35,558
I'm sorry. I don't speak Japanese.

159
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:42,023
<i>Understand that'? Gaijin?

160
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:43,357
Takashi.

161

We were just talking.

That word you called me, gaijin or something or other,

164
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,077
what does that mean exactly?

165
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:58,539
Means, turn around,

166
00:24:59,624 --> 00:25:00,833
keep walking.

167
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:03,377
That's exactly what we gonna do.
Come on, man, let's roll.

168
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:04,921
Yo, look, man, he's yakuza.

169
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:07,965
Now, see, that's funny,

170
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:11,093
'cause I thought this was, like, a free country

171
00:25:11,928 --> 00:25:14,889
where a girl could talk to whoever she wants.

172
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:19,894
You know who I am, boy?

173
00:25:20,228 --> 00:25:24,440
Yeah. You're like
the Justin Timberlake of Japan, right?

174
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:31,447
Leave.

175
00:25:31,614 --> 00:25:34,742
Damn, man. You know yakuza? The Mafia?

176
00:25:36,953 --> 00:25:40,540
Look, sorry, DK-san.
Monkey didn't have his banana today.

177
00:25:40,665 --> 00:25:42,333
Hey, D, let's go.

178
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:43,876
It's time to race.

179
00:25:47,964 --> 00:25:49,840
Good luck, Timberlake.

180
00:25:58,432 --> 00:26:02,186
You're the one that's lucky, 'cause I'm about to race.

181
00:26:05,356 --> 00:26:06,983
Then let's race.

182
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:12,822
With what, huh? Your skateboard?

183
00:26:15,032 --> 00:26:17,827
Easy to sound cocky when you got no ride.

184
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:19,829
Take mine.

185
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:25,334
Let's race.

186
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:31,966
What? I wanna see what the kid's got.

187
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:40,182
Can he drive?

188
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:42,727
Can he drive?

189
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:46,856
You know what DK stands for?

190
00:26:47,857 --> 00:26:49,233
Donkey Kong?

191
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:51,027
Drift King.

192
00:26:52,695 --> 00:26:53,863
Drift?

193
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:56,782
What do you mean, drift?

194
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:11,505
Still need a dictionary?

195
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:13,549
You know that real famous painting?

196
00:27:13,633 --> 00:27:16,010
The one of the woman who's smiling all the time?

197
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:18,304
- The Mona <i>Lisa.</i>
- Right, right, right. Mona Lisa.

198
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:21,766
Well, look, man, this car right here's
like the Mona <i>Lisa</i> of the drift world.

199
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:24,560
Han rebuilt this bad boy from ground up.

200
00:27:24,644 --> 00:27:29,148
We talking forged pistons,
bigger turbo, new rods, new crankshaft.

201
00:27:30,191 --> 00:27:33,486
Hey, man, Han's labor ain't cheap, man, you feel me?

202
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:37,782
Well, if I needed a 30-second lesson
on how to drift...

203
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:40,534
All right, look, man, there's lots of ways
you can do this, all right?

204
00:27:40,618 --> 00:27:41,702
Hand braking is the easiest,

205
00:27:41,786 --> 00:27:44,163
so the first thing I want you to do,
I want you to rip that e-brake.

206
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:47,917
All right, after you rip the e-brake,
then I want you to power over.

207
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:52,004
You know what?
Just don't mess up Mona, all right?

208
00:27:52,088 --> 00:27:53,422
All right.

209
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:48,561
Ready.

210
00:28:49,979 --> 00:28:51,063
Set.

211
00:28:53,983 --> 00:28:54,984
Go!

212
00:29:35,775 --> 00:29:37,151
I told you.

213
00:30:18,067 --> 00:30:19,235
Damn it!

214
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:22,780
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

215
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:07,199
Damn it!

216
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:50,469
Don't leave town.

217
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:08,237
Do you know what time it is?

218
00:33:08,404 --> 00:33:10,572
I thought it was around 7:00.

219
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:13,951
You know, US is a few hours behind.

220
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:19,790
Looks like the party was better here, anyway.

221
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:24,753
Have you been racing, Sean?

222
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:30,592
You're out of here.

223
00:33:34,096 --> 00:33:35,347
Go ahead.

224
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:38,642
You don't get it, do you?

225
00:33:38,726 --> 00:33:40,853
You have nowhere else to go.

226
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:45,399
If it doesn't work out here,
you're going to jail. Do you get that?

227
00:33:48,152 --> 00:33:52,031
This isn't a game.
And I'm gonna tell you one more time,

228
00:33:52,406 --> 00:33:56,952
if you're gonna live under my roof,
you're gonna go by my rules or get out.

229
00:33:57,828 --> 00:33:59,204
Understand?

230
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:01,749
Understand?

231
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:04,126
Yes, sir.

232
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,011
Get in.

233
00:34:56,637 --> 00:34:58,597
I'll get you your money.

234
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:01,850
Why you talking like you have a choice?

235
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:19,076
There's a guy in there with a paw that owes me some money.

236
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:20,327
A Paw?

237
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,622
Go get me my money.

238
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:27,501
Okay.

239
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:23,891
Han said,

240
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:27,019
<i>okane.

241
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:37,613
<i>Han send, okane.

242
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:07,851
Let's go.

243
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:18,862
You're in the pickup and delivery business now.

244
00:37:18,946 --> 00:37:21,531
I might call you once a week or once an hour.

245
00:37:21,615 --> 00:37:24,910
I don't care if you're sick as a dog
or in bed with Beyoncé.

246
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:26,662
I call, you show.

247
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:31,583
- Only if you teach me how to drift.
- This ain't a negotiation.

248
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,794
I wasn't negotiating.

249
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:24,011
What's he doing here?

250
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:28,056
He's paying me back for
that crumpled beer can sitting in my garage.

251
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,017
Hope he's not driving.

252
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:34,313
<i>Gaijin.

253
00:38:35,564 --> 00:38:39,026
When is your next race?
I'd really like to be there.

254
00:38:40,569 --> 00:38:41,987
Why not be in it?

255
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:46,533
You really a bad ass, cowboy, or you just talk like one?

256
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,660
You heard me.

257
00:38:49,578 --> 00:38:51,913
Ready to lose another car, Han?

258
00:38:52,289 --> 00:38:55,542
I'm ready to take that '86 Corolla off your hands.

259
00:38:57,419 --> 00:38:58,754
All right.

260
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:01,006
Put up the '72 Skyline.

261
00:39:02,132 --> 00:39:03,258
Done.

262
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,429
What do you think, Morimoto?

263
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:12,601
Get him out of here.

264
00:39:13,435 --> 00:39:15,562
We have business to discuss.

265
00:39:25,614 --> 00:39:27,407
Your shipment's late.

266
00:39:27,491 --> 00:39:30,619
Since when are you so worried about the details?

267
00:39:32,496 --> 00:39:34,998
When is the shipment arriving, Han?

268
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,127
Just sit pretty and let me handle it.

269
00:40:01,108 --> 00:40:02,776
Hey, Dad, it's me.

270
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:06,988
I had to stay after school
for some extracurricular activities.

271
00:40:07,406 --> 00:40:09,408
So I'll be home a little later.

272
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:12,953
Sir.

273
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:18,250
You really need to stop following me around.

274
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:20,335
What are you doing here?

275
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:24,923
I thought I'd stop by and ask your boyfriend
for some drifting lessons.

276
00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:28,427
Trust me.
You don't wanna be a part of this world.

277
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:30,637
It's good enough for you.

278
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,722
You don't know anything about me.

279
00:40:32,806 --> 00:40:35,100
Well, why don't you think I know?

280
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:37,561
'Cause I'm a gaijin? An outsider?

281
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:40,689
Let me guess.

282
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:43,859
You're an army brat who moved around a lot.

283
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:46,445
Your mama and daddy was never home.

284
00:40:46,528 --> 00:40:49,448
So you walked around pissed off all the time.

285
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:52,868
And now you found your family with these drift nuts.

286
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,373
Zero for one, cowboy.

287
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:14,181
Why can't you go find a nice Japanese girl
like the rest of the white guys around here?

288
00:41:19,853 --> 00:41:22,105
Is everything okay back there?

289
00:41:22,898 --> 00:41:24,524
I can handle DK.

290
00:41:25,484 --> 00:41:27,360
<i>I thought he's yakuza.

291
00:41:28,028 --> 00:41:29,738
<i>His uncle's yakuza.

292
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:34,242
He's just playing gangster in his little storage room.

293
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:38,663
But I need him.

294
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:42,584
He keeps Uncle Kamata from poking around too much.

295
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:44,753
What do you mean?

296
00:41:45,754 --> 00:41:49,382
Well, his uncle gets a piece of the action
from everyone on his turf.

297
00:41:49,466 --> 00:41:51,134
We're on his turf.

298
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:55,597
50% of something is better than 100% of nothing.

299
00:41:58,099 --> 00:41:59,935
So have you raced DK?

300
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:02,812
Why not? Is he that good?

301
00:42:03,313 --> 00:42:05,440
What's the point of a race?

302
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:08,902
To see if I'm better than the other guy.

303
00:42:08,985 --> 00:42:11,029
Just proves you're faster, that's all.

304
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:14,533
If I were to race, it would have to be
for something important.

305
00:42:14,616 --> 00:42:16,618
Or why else do it at all?

306
00:42:18,912 --> 00:42:20,872
Why are you letting me race?

307
00:42:20,956 --> 00:42:23,166
'Cause you're DK's kryptonite.

308
00:42:24,668 --> 00:42:26,461
And you owe me a car.

309
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,277
Oh, shit.

310
00:42:57,784 --> 00:42:58,952
What the...

311
00:42:59,035 --> 00:43:01,621
Police cars here are only factory-tuned.

312
00:43:01,705 --> 00:43:06,293
You can do better than 180 k,
they can't catch you, so they don't even try.

313
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:12,007
You know what?
I'm beginning to like this country already.

314
00:43:27,814 --> 00:43:28,982
Danny!

315
00:43:29,899 --> 00:43:31,693
You're looking good.

316
00:43:34,863 --> 00:43:36,031
Disco.

317
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:45,457
We gotta catch up.
Get you a drink on me, huh?

318
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:46,833
Let's go.

319
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:01,389
Uh-oh.

320
00:44:01,681 --> 00:44:03,308
Easy now, ladies.

321
00:44:06,311 --> 00:44:07,562
Come on.

322
00:44:11,316 --> 00:44:13,652
What's up? How you doing?

323
00:44:13,735 --> 00:44:15,070
Hey, baby.

324
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:36,800
Keep your hands off the kid, girls.
He's underage.

325
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:42,806
Ladies, ladies, ladies.
Disneyland for grownups, huh?

326
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:45,850
- All these girls, man, they look like...
- What, models?

327
00:44:45,934 --> 00:44:47,018
Check it out.

328
00:44:47,102 --> 00:44:50,271
See, Tokyo is the fashion capital
on this side of the planet, all right?

329
00:44:50,355 --> 00:44:53,233
Now, imagine you been posing all day.
I mean, that's a lot of hard work.

330
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:54,901
Not only do you get tired, but, on top of that,

331
00:44:54,984 --> 00:44:58,530
you wanna have a little fun, but you can't
'cause you don't even know nobody in town.

332
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:01,866
And most of the guys around here are
too chicken shit to even try picking up one.

333
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:03,618
So what do you do?

334
00:45:04,494 --> 00:45:07,706
Man, you talk to the little dude who makes you laugh.

335
00:45:07,789 --> 00:45:08,873
Yeah.

336
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:13,503
Look, man, I don't just think outside the box.
I tear it up.

337
00:45:13,586 --> 00:45:15,171
That's my thing.

338
00:45:15,296 --> 00:45:16,297
Yo!

339
00:45:23,388 --> 00:45:24,472
Sean!

340
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:11,269
The red Evo's yours.

341
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:24,866
What do you mean?

342
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,285
You're representing me now.

343
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:30,371
What you think, I'm gonna let you roll in a Hyundai?

344
00:46:56,231 --> 00:46:57,440
Oh, man.

345
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:04,072
Damn it.

346
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:06,908
You call that drifting?

347
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:13,373
My mother, she's blind in one eye
and she can drift better than that.

348
00:47:16,209 --> 00:47:18,294
Han, where did you find this guy?

349
00:47:19,504 --> 00:47:22,257
Will someone please teach this guy how to drift?

350
00:47:45,947 --> 00:47:47,448
Is that yours?

351
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:49,742
Sure is.

352
00:47:57,292 --> 00:47:58,585
What happened?

353
00:47:59,836 --> 00:48:03,256
I don't know. I found it this way at the base.

354
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:08,720
It's got potential.

355
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:15,977
Yeah, maybe. We'll see.

356
00:48:20,732 --> 00:48:23,568
You know, Sean, the Japanese have a saying.

357
00:48:26,696 --> 00:48:29,157
"The nail that sticks out gets hammered."

358
00:48:33,202 --> 00:48:34,996
You're gonna be late.

359
00:48:46,633 --> 00:48:47,717
Sean!

360
00:49:07,028 --> 00:49:09,697
That's for selling me a broken iPod!

361
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:11,699
Come on, man, you broke it.

362
00:49:16,746 --> 00:49:18,122
Hey, whoa, whoa.

363
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,209
There must be a misunderstanding.

364
00:49:21,876 --> 00:49:25,004
Out of my way, or you're next.

365
00:49:25,088 --> 00:49:28,007
- Take it easy.
- Look, man, I don't do refunds, all right?

366
00:49:28,091 --> 00:49:30,385
Okay, let's go, then! Let's go!

367
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:32,136
Touch me again...

368
00:49:35,848 --> 00:49:36,933
Here.

369
00:49:38,059 --> 00:49:40,061
Try not to break this one.

370
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:57,078
Say, man!
What the hell is wrong with you, huh?

371
00:49:57,161 --> 00:49:59,998
Now everybody's gonna want exchanges around here.

372
00:50:00,081 --> 00:50:01,165
Damn!

373
00:50:13,761 --> 00:50:16,097
Not easy saving the day, is it?

374
00:50:16,848 --> 00:50:19,726
Maybe you could give me some pointers sometime.

375
00:50:19,809 --> 00:50:21,477
You're doing all right.

376
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:23,771
Thanks.

377
00:50:27,275 --> 00:50:28,359
Hey.

378
00:50:29,569 --> 00:50:30,653
Yeah?

379
00:50:31,696 --> 00:50:33,823
Sorry about the other night.

380
00:50:34,449 --> 00:50:36,784
Your life isn't any of my business.

381
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:39,746
It's okay.

382
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:03,144
Foul!

383
00:51:04,312 --> 00:51:05,855
- Ain't no damn foul.
- That was a foul.

384
00:51:05,938 --> 00:51:07,315
- Yo, you in my face.
- That was a foul.

385
00:51:07,398 --> 00:51:09,901
Hey, Han, sort this wanker out.

386
00:51:09,984 --> 00:51:11,235
A wanker?

387
00:51:11,319 --> 00:51:13,529
What do I look like, a zebra?

388
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:22,830
So, how did you end up over here, anyway?

389
00:51:23,956 --> 00:51:26,334
Well, you know those old Westerns

390
00:51:27,043 --> 00:51:29,962
where the cowboys make a run for the border?

391
00:51:32,632 --> 00:51:34,342
This is my Mexico.

392
00:51:38,012 --> 00:51:40,556
Why'd you let me race with your car?

393
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:42,934
You knew I was gonna wreck it.

394
00:51:43,518 --> 00:51:44,769
Why not?

395
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:48,106
'Cause it's a lot of money.

396
00:51:48,189 --> 00:51:49,690
I have money.

397
00:51:51,025 --> 00:51:53,861
It's trust and character I need around me.

398
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:59,700
You know, who you choose to be around
you lets you know who you are.

399
00:52:01,744 --> 00:52:05,331
And one car in exchange for knowing what a man's made of,

400
00:52:05,665 --> 00:52:07,959
that's a price I can live with.

401
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:14,715
Look at all those people down there.

402
00:52:15,383 --> 00:52:17,718
They follow the rules, for what?

403
00:52:19,011 --> 00:52:21,305
They're letting fear lead them.

404
00:52:23,224 --> 00:52:25,351
What happens if they don't?

405
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:30,398
Life's simple.
You make choices and you don't look back.

406
00:52:45,371 --> 00:52:48,749
<i>So, if you don't drift to win, what do you drift for?

407
00:52:49,542 --> 00:52:52,170
<i>- You really want to know?
- Yeah.

408
00:52:53,004 --> 00:52:54,547
<i>Okay. Let's go.

409
00:54:11,958 --> 00:54:14,502
<i>There's no "wax on, wax off" with drifting.

410
00:54:14,919 --> 00:54:16,337
Learn by doing it.

411
00:54:17,255 --> 00:54:21,425
The first drifters invented drifting
out here in the mountains by feeling it.

412
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:23,135
So feel it.

413
00:54:35,731 --> 00:54:36,899
Again!

414
00:54:39,235 --> 00:54:41,696
- What's in this bag?
- You'll see.

415
00:54:42,071 --> 00:54:45,074
How much you got?
Keep going, keep going.

416
00:54:51,539 --> 00:54:54,125
I'm so good, man, I could sell rubbers to a monk.

417
00:54:59,213 --> 00:55:00,214
Again.

418
00:55:22,361 --> 00:55:23,529
Again.

419
00:55:32,955 --> 00:55:35,708
Watch it. Watch it. Not too early, now.

420
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:43,341
Go, go, go, go!

421
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:54,685
Not bad.

422
00:55:54,852 --> 00:55:56,771
Don't lose it! Don't lose it!

423
00:56:34,725 --> 00:56:35,976
Hey Han...

424
00:56:36,811 --> 00:56:38,437
Take a look at this.

425
00:56:42,066 --> 00:56:43,526
You have a visitor.

426
00:56:48,322 --> 00:56:51,784
Hey, Twink. Get this man a bunk.

427
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:08,360
Pleasure doing business.

428
00:58:12,198 --> 00:58:15,201
Yeah, baby. I told you. I told you, didn't I?

429
00:58:54,865 --> 00:58:58,786
It's actually not bad.
I didn't even have to put ketchup on it.

430
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:01,997
See, I'm not a total gaijin.

431
00:59:03,791 --> 00:59:07,878
I hate that word. It's what they used
to call me when I was a kid.

432
00:59:09,296 --> 00:59:11,507
I thought you were born here.

433
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:14,677
Well, "outsider" can mean many different things.

434
00:59:19,974 --> 00:59:22,017
My mom died when I was 10.

435
00:59:23,394 --> 00:59:26,855
She came out here from Australia
when she finished high school.

436
00:59:26,981 --> 00:59:31,068
And all I know about her is
that she went to work in a hostess bar.

437
00:59:34,196 --> 00:59:36,323
DK's grandmother took me in.

438
00:59:39,493 --> 00:59:42,371
Well, my parents split up when I was three.

439
00:59:43,581 --> 00:59:47,251
Me and Mom moved around a lot.
Mostly 'cause of me.

440
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:51,255
Well, it was all 'cause of me.

441
00:59:53,173 --> 00:59:55,676
Kind of made myself an outsider, you know,

442
00:59:55,884 --> 00:59:58,178
without even thinking about it.

443
01:00:00,306 --> 01:00:04,310
But I realize now, outsider or insider,
it doesn't really matter.

444
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:08,188
All that matters is knowing what you really want

445
01:00:09,189 --> 01:00:10,899
and going after it.

446
01:00:31,045 --> 01:00:33,839
We used to come up here when we were kids.

447
01:00:34,298 --> 01:00:37,635
Even before we could drive we'd cut class, sneak out,

448
01:00:37,718 --> 01:00:40,262
come up here, and watch the older kids drift.

449
01:00:46,977 --> 01:00:49,021
Things were different back then.

450
01:00:53,067 --> 01:00:55,903
Once I got my license, I practically lived up here.

451
01:00:56,487 --> 01:00:59,073
Back then, kids just drove whatever they had.

452
01:00:59,239 --> 01:01:01,909
You know, we just made do.
No one bothered us.

453
01:01:03,327 --> 01:01:07,414
The day I got my license
is the day I got my first speeding ticket.

454
01:01:07,498 --> 01:01:09,917
The day after that, I won my first race.

455
01:01:10,417 --> 01:01:12,961
I beat this rich kid by three lengths.

456
01:01:13,962 --> 01:01:16,715
I gotta admit, it felt good.

457
01:01:18,509 --> 01:01:19,802
It felt like...

458
01:01:20,094 --> 01:01:22,304
Like everything else just disappears.

459
01:01:24,306 --> 01:01:27,476
- No past and no future.
- No problems.

460
01:01:29,853 --> 01:01:31,438
Just the moment.

461
01:01:54,962 --> 01:01:56,630
Boy needs to chill.

462
01:01:59,133 --> 01:02:01,343
Hey, Twink, I'm gonna grab another set.

463
01:02:01,427 --> 01:02:03,679
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Another set?

464
01:02:03,971 --> 01:02:08,100
No. Look, that was your third set today.
I mean, them tires ain't cheap.

465
01:02:18,485 --> 01:02:22,072
DK, grab a chair.
We're about to roast some marshmallows.

466
01:02:23,115 --> 01:02:24,825
Yo, come on, man, look...

467
01:02:37,171 --> 01:02:38,922
Stay away from her,

468
01:02:39,131 --> 01:02:42,426
or the only thing you'll be driving is a wheelchair.

469
01:02:48,474 --> 01:02:50,267
Find yourself a new driver.

470
01:03:03,071 --> 01:03:05,532
- I'm all right.
- What'd you expect?

471
01:03:06,325 --> 01:03:09,995
You didn't just play with fire,
you soaked the matches in gasoline.

472
01:03:33,393 --> 01:03:34,728
It's over.

473
01:03:55,499 --> 01:03:58,836
- All this over a gaijin?
- I am a gaijin.

474
01:04:01,755 --> 01:04:03,465
You've changed, DK.

475
01:04:08,846 --> 01:04:10,639
You say I've changed.

476
01:04:12,975 --> 01:04:15,602
But we're not so different, you and I.

477
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:19,731
We're both products of screw ups, aren't we?

478
01:04:25,737 --> 01:04:28,991
They say your mom was the best trick

479
01:04:29,074 --> 01:04:31,618
in all of Kabukicho back in the day.

480
01:04:32,119 --> 01:04:33,745
Leave my mother out of this.

481
01:04:33,829 --> 01:04:37,249
If we hadn't taken you in, you'd be just like her,

482
01:04:38,125 --> 01:04:40,168
doing anything for a buck.

483
01:04:41,295 --> 01:04:45,299
Think anyone would take a second look
at you if it wasn't for your uncle?

484
01:04:58,896 --> 01:05:00,772
We're the same, Neela.

485
01:05:04,651 --> 01:05:07,821
Difference is I know who I am and where I belong.

486
01:05:13,744 --> 01:05:15,704
Do you know who you are?

487
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:22,044
Do you know where you belong?

488
01:05:41,313 --> 01:05:42,356
Hey.

489
01:05:47,402 --> 01:05:48,654
Come on.

490
01:06:32,308 --> 01:06:33,309
Uncle.

491
01:06:35,853 --> 01:06:39,482
Uncle Kamata, I was just about to go see you.

492
01:06:40,233 --> 01:06:42,777
Have you been well?

493
01:06:42,860 --> 01:06:43,861
Yes.

494
01:06:44,612 --> 01:06:46,656
Here's last week's take.

495
01:06:47,949 --> 01:06:51,327
Business good?

496
01:06:53,329 --> 01:06:54,455
Please.

497
01:07:04,882 --> 01:07:06,800
To tell you the truth...

498
01:07:09,929 --> 01:07:12,306
I look over these printouts of yours...

499
01:07:13,182 --> 01:07:17,269
and I don't understand half of what I'm looking at.

500
01:07:19,188 --> 01:07:21,524
It looks more complicated than it is.

501
01:07:23,776 --> 01:07:28,155
Then how is it even I am able to figure out...

502
01:07:30,074 --> 01:07:35,663
that your partner is stealing from us?

503
01:07:39,083 --> 01:07:40,834
Even if that were true...

504
01:07:41,710 --> 01:07:45,589
It couldn't have been much, uncle.
I would've caught it.

505
01:07:50,052 --> 01:07:52,137
There's an old saying:

506
01:07:53,931 --> 01:07:55,891
For want of a nail...

507
01:07:56,433 --> 01:07:58,435
the horseshoe was lost.

508
01:08:00,104 --> 01:08:03,524
For want of a horseshoe, the steed was lost.

509
01:08:04,608 --> 01:08:06,527
For want of a steed...

510
01:08:07,695 --> 01:08:09,738
the message was not delivered.

511
01:08:11,532 --> 01:08:13,784
For want of an undelivered message...

512
01:08:15,953 --> 01:08:17,871
the war was lost.

513
01:08:34,054 --> 01:08:37,266
I miss your father.

514
01:09:33,781 --> 01:09:35,032
Hey, brother.

515
01:09:36,033 --> 01:09:39,244
I vouched for you!
Put my reputation on the line for you!

516
01:09:39,495 --> 01:09:40,829
We were partners!

517
01:09:41,246 --> 01:09:44,083
You think you can keep your side deals from me?

518
01:09:44,166 --> 01:09:47,086
Come on. We ain't in the Boy Scouts.

519
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:50,339
- This is what we do.
- Takashi!

520
01:09:57,513 --> 01:09:59,056
What about now?

521
01:09:59,306 --> 01:10:00,474
Hmm?

522
01:10:01,183 --> 01:10:02,935
Is this what we do?

523
01:10:04,478 --> 01:10:06,105
Man, you need me.

524
01:10:06,355 --> 01:10:09,900
You'd still be shaking down tea houses
for chump change if it wasn't for me.

525
01:10:19,410 --> 01:10:22,204
- Get in!
- Go! Go! Go!

526
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:27,501
Come on.

527
01:13:49,119 --> 01:13:50,495
Sean, Sean!

528
01:16:36,203 --> 01:16:37,204
Takashi.

529
01:16:37,788 --> 01:16:38,789
Get in.

530
01:16:46,546 --> 01:16:48,715
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

531
01:16:59,101 --> 01:17:00,227
Okay.

532
01:17:01,436 --> 01:17:02,813
I'll go with you.

533
01:17:03,313 --> 01:17:04,481
Neela.

534
01:17:15,534 --> 01:17:17,869
See you when Daddy's not around.

535
01:17:41,351 --> 01:17:43,520
- I'm putting you on a plane tonight.
- Dad...

536
01:17:43,603 --> 01:17:45,230
Sean, don't argue with me.

537
01:17:45,313 --> 01:17:48,108
I did this. I can't run away.

538
01:17:49,276 --> 01:17:50,277
I can't.

539
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:54,072
Sean, I'm your father.
I'm responsible for your well-being.

540
01:17:54,614 --> 01:17:56,658
And I'm responsible for my mess.

541
01:17:59,786 --> 01:18:01,580
I gotta do this.

542
01:18:03,790 --> 01:18:05,750
Can you understand that?

543
01:18:21,808 --> 01:18:24,519
At least you're not redoing my mistakes.

544
01:18:53,256 --> 01:18:55,008
You all right, man?

545
01:18:58,887 --> 01:19:02,224
We're leaving town.
Look, I know some people...

546
01:19:04,309 --> 01:19:06,102
I can't do it, Twink.

547
01:19:07,062 --> 01:19:10,148
Look, DK wants your head.

548
01:19:11,024 --> 01:19:12,359
All right?

549
01:19:12,776 --> 01:19:17,072
And the trouble you just made for Kamata?
You're done here, bro.

550
01:19:19,616 --> 01:19:23,036
- Maybe I should talk to Kamata.
- What?

551
01:19:24,579 --> 01:19:26,248
DK answers to him.

552
01:19:29,042 --> 01:19:31,336
I know I just didn't hear that.

553
01:19:33,338 --> 01:19:36,716
I gotta end this. I'm gonna go talk to him.

554
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:38,802
What, are you crazy, huh?

555
01:19:39,010 --> 01:19:40,595
Han is dead, all right!

556
01:19:40,679 --> 01:19:43,682
Plus, you can't just walk into Kamata's place, man!

557
01:19:46,810 --> 01:19:48,353
It's all I got.

558
01:19:54,943 --> 01:19:58,113
Something I think Han would've wanted you to have.

559
01:20:12,711 --> 01:20:14,129
What's this?

560
01:20:15,755 --> 01:20:20,176
You're gonna need it if you're gonna
make it out of Kamata's place alive.

561
01:20:23,263 --> 01:20:24,931
Don't you need it?

562
01:20:26,641 --> 01:20:30,145
No, it's cool. Look, I'll figure it out.

563
01:21:03,845 --> 01:21:07,140
I'd like to see Mr. Kamata, please.

564
01:21:40,048 --> 01:21:41,132
Sean.

565
01:21:45,887 --> 01:21:47,555
You need to leave.

566
01:21:47,889 --> 01:21:50,016
You came to the wrong place.

567
01:21:50,183 --> 01:21:52,394
I didn't come here to see you.

568
01:21:52,811 --> 01:21:54,062
Takashi.

569
01:21:54,896 --> 01:21:56,606
Who's your friend?

570
01:21:58,233 --> 01:21:59,234
Nobody.

571
01:22:00,276 --> 01:22:01,694
I can handle this.

572
01:22:02,487 --> 01:22:05,782
I have something which belongs to you, sir.

573
01:22:22,674 --> 01:22:23,925
You think

574
01:22:25,009 --> 01:22:29,556
you can walk in here, dump some cash and walk out?

575
01:22:31,683 --> 01:22:35,728
I know I'm only returning what belonged
to you in the first place, sir.

576
01:22:37,230 --> 01:22:39,441
But that's not why I really came.

577
01:22:40,108 --> 01:22:42,110
I came here to apologize.

578
01:22:44,362 --> 01:22:47,991
I know your nephew and I have embarrassed ourselves badly.

579
01:22:48,116 --> 01:22:50,118
Don't listen to this gaijin.

580
01:22:51,453 --> 01:22:52,495
Takashi...

581
01:22:53,997 --> 01:22:56,875
after everything you've done, you're giving me orders?

582
01:22:56,958 --> 01:22:58,126
I apologize.

583
01:22:59,961 --> 01:23:03,756
Sir, I'm here to offer you a peaceful solution.

584
01:23:06,384 --> 01:23:08,845
How do you plan to accomplish that?

585
01:23:10,305 --> 01:23:11,473
A race.

586
01:23:16,686 --> 01:23:20,815
DK and I have caused nothing but problems for you, for us.

587
01:23:22,567 --> 01:23:26,529
And I'm asking you to allow us to settle this,
once and for all.

588
01:23:28,364 --> 01:23:29,574
We race

589
01:23:31,326 --> 01:23:33,411
and the loser leaves town for good.

590
01:23:33,495 --> 01:23:36,331
I've already beat this piece of shit once!

591
01:23:36,498 --> 01:23:37,624
Good.

592
01:23:38,583 --> 01:23:41,002
Then it should be easy.

593
01:24:19,541 --> 01:24:21,668
The cops took all the cars.

594
01:24:21,918 --> 01:24:23,002
Hey!

595
01:25:39,495 --> 01:25:41,205
That's why she's spitting.

596
01:26:04,646 --> 01:26:08,191
We almost there, Twink.
Couple more tweaks.

597
01:26:09,734 --> 01:26:12,111
It's not the car I'm worried about, man.

598
01:26:13,488 --> 01:26:16,991
DK picked this road for a reason.
This is his mountain.

599
01:26:19,494 --> 01:26:22,622
He's the only one to ever make it to the bottom.

600
01:30:16,563 --> 01:30:17,647
Yeah!

601
01:30:24,905 --> 01:30:26,573
- Yeah!
- Yes!

602
01:31:25,132 --> 01:31:26,133
Come on.

603
01:31:37,352 --> 01:31:38,603
Yeah! Come on!

604
01:31:38,687 --> 01:31:41,314
- Come on, Sean.
- Let's go! Let's go!

605
01:31:41,398 --> 01:31:43,024
Sean, you the boss. Let's go.

606
01:32:11,469 --> 01:32:13,722
Damn! Come on, man! That ain't right.

607
01:34:23,810 --> 01:34:25,854
Yeah, baby!
That's what I'm talking about, man.

608
01:34:25,937 --> 01:34:27,314
I told you!

609
01:34:55,592 --> 01:34:57,427
You're free to go.

610
01:35:32,087 --> 01:35:34,214
Hey, yo, Sean! Yo, Sean!

611
01:35:34,881 --> 01:35:36,591
Hey, check this out, man.

612
01:35:36,883 --> 01:35:39,719
This dude over here wanna race the new DK.

613
01:35:40,720 --> 01:35:43,515
Heard he's been beating everybody around Asia, too.

614
01:35:43,598 --> 01:35:45,433
Not tonight, Twinkie.

615
01:35:48,895 --> 01:35:50,563
Said he knew Han.

616
01:35:57,153 --> 01:35:58,905
Said Han was family.

617
01:36:12,919 --> 01:36:14,254
All right.

618
01:36:14,629 --> 01:36:15,755
Let's race.

619
01:36:42,991 --> 01:36:44,325
Nice ride.

620
01:36:44,784 --> 01:36:47,787
I won it from my friend Han, a few years ago.

621
01:36:49,873 --> 01:36:52,542
I didn't know he was into American muscle.

622
01:36:52,625 --> 01:36:55,128
He was when he was rolling with me.

623
01:36:57,755 --> 01:37:00,216
You know this ain't no 10-second race.

624
01:37:00,675 --> 01:37:02,594
I got nothing but time.

625
01:37:06,181 --> 01:37:07,724
You ready, kid?

626
01:37:18,610 --> 01:37:20,278
Come on, Sean! Come on!

627
01:37:22,322 --> 01:37:23,490
Ready!

628
01:37:26,576 --> 01:37:27,660
Set!

629
01:37:31,956 --> 01:37:32,999
Go!
