1
00:00:18,792 --> 00:00:21,465
<i>There was a time above.</i>

2
00:00:21,632 --> 00:00:23,987
<i>A time before.</i>

3
00:00:24,192 --> 00:00:26,945
<i>There were perfect things,</i>

4
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:29,382
<i>diamond absolutes.</i>

5
00:00:30,392 --> 00:00:32,667
<i>How things fall.</i>

6
00:00:32,832 --> 00:00:35,266
<i>Things on Earth.</i>

7
00:00:35,432 --> 00:00:37,024
<i>And what falls...</i>

8
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,832
Master Wayne!

9
00:00:39,032 --> 00:00:40,385
<i>- ... is fallen.</i>
- Bruce!

10
00:00:42,353 --> 00:00:43,706
<i>Bruce, it's all right.</i>

11
00:00:46,193 --> 00:00:47,512
<i>Bruce, please.</i>

12
00:03:10,956 --> 00:03:12,947
Martha.

13
00:04:44,798 --> 00:04:48,837
<i>In the dream,
they took me to the light.</i>

14
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:50,829
<i>A beautiful lie.</i>

15
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:37,348
<i>- Jack.</i>
- Bruce.

16
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:38,952
Jack, listen to me.

17
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:41,359
I want you to get everyone
out of the building right now.

18
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,318
<i>- You understand?</i>
- Oh, my God.

19
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:44,695
<i>Stay away from the windows!</i>

20
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,839
Let's go. Come on.
Start moving now, people. Let's go.

21
00:05:46,999 --> 00:05:49,638
The boss wants us out of the building,
so let's make it happen.

22
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:51,716
Jack. Jack!

23
00:07:32,722 --> 00:07:34,258
<i>We're sorry.</i>

24
00:07:34,282 --> 00:07:38,594
<i>All circuits are busy now.
Will you please try your call again later?</i>

25
00:07:40,082 --> 00:07:41,595
Heavenly God,

26
00:07:42,802 --> 00:07:44,360
creator of Heaven and Earth,

27
00:07:45,722 --> 00:07:46,871
have mercy on my soul.

28
00:07:50,802 --> 00:07:51,871
Jack!

29
00:08:30,363 --> 00:08:33,161
Buddy hands! Everybody show me! Good job!

30
00:08:34,203 --> 00:08:35,431
Come on, guys.

31
00:08:37,243 --> 00:08:38,562
<i>Hold on tight.</i>

32
00:08:40,163 --> 00:08:41,163
<i>Come on, guys.</i>

33
00:08:42,763 --> 00:08:43,763
Go.

34
00:08:44,003 --> 00:08:45,072
<i>Mr. Wayne!</i>

35
00:08:45,283 --> 00:08:48,195
Mr. Wayne! I can't feel my legs.

36
00:08:48,683 --> 00:08:49,939
I can't feel my legs.

37
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:51,803
We need help over here!

38
00:08:52,363 --> 00:08:53,682
Help me. I can't feel my legs.

39
00:08:53,843 --> 00:08:55,436
You're gonna be okay. You hear me?

40
00:08:56,364 --> 00:08:58,559
Wallace?
What do they call you, Wally? Huh?

41
00:09:00,724 --> 00:09:01,839
You're the boss, boss.

42
00:09:03,524 --> 00:09:05,674
All right. You're gonna be okay.

43
00:09:05,844 --> 00:09:07,197
Easy, easy. Come on.

44
00:09:10,484 --> 00:09:11,963
<i>Oh, my God.
I can't move my leg.</i>

45
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,914
My God. I can't feel my legs.

46
00:09:22,084 --> 00:09:25,235
It's okay.
You're gonna be okay.

47
00:09:25,404 --> 00:09:28,555
You're okay. All right? Huh?

48
00:09:28,724 --> 00:09:30,364
You know what? We're gonna find your mom.

49
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:31,873
Where is she?

50
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,837
All that wind is bad luck.
Blood in the sky.

51
00:11:38,607 --> 00:11:39,722
Oh, there she is!

52
00:11:48,327 --> 00:11:49,362
Miss Lane.

53
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,886
<i>Miss Lane. Jimmy Olsen.</i>

54
00:11:53,048 --> 00:11:54,879
Photographer. Obviously.

55
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:56,601
Where's Heron?

56
00:11:56,888 --> 00:11:58,162
Uh, trouble at the border.

57
00:12:00,688 --> 00:12:03,566
So, uh, how'd you land it?
This is, like, pioneer stuff.

58
00:12:03,728 --> 00:12:05,958
Amajagh's never given an interview.

59
00:12:06,128 --> 00:12:09,086
You know what Heron always
says when we're on assignment together?

60
00:12:10,448 --> 00:12:11,881
Not a goddamn thing.

61
00:12:12,808 --> 00:12:13,957
I like Heron.

62
00:12:27,688 --> 00:12:28,916
Let's go.

63
00:12:35,568 --> 00:12:37,639
<i>Passports.
Electronics. Phones. Camera.</i>

64
00:12:37,809 --> 00:12:40,118
Your fixer said that
the general approved photos.

65
00:13:08,849 --> 00:13:11,204
Are you a terrorist, General?

66
00:13:12,289 --> 00:13:15,440
They did not tell me the interview
was with a lady.

67
00:13:15,609 --> 00:13:17,042
I'm not a lady. I'm a journalist.

68
00:13:19,809 --> 00:13:22,563
<i>What I am is a man with nothing</i>

69
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:25,327
<i>except a love of my people.</i>

70
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:29,039
Who's paying for these
security contractors, General?

71
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,931
Who pays for the drones
that pass over our heads at night?

72
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,466
<i>One question begs another.</i>

73
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:36,639
<i>Yes?</i>

74
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,848
<i>Say what you're saying, General.</i>

75
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:40,409
It's just a camera.

76
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,881
The United States
has declared its neutrality

77
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,170
in your country's civil war

78
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,400
both in policy and in principle.

79
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:49,730
Don't open... You just exposed...

80
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:54,325
These pious American fictions...

81
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:56,082
<i>...spoken like truth.</i>

82
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,250
Okay. That's my film.

83
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:07,245
Men with power obey
neither policy nor principle, Miss Lane.

84
00:14:10,651 --> 00:14:11,686
<i>No one is different.</i>

85
00:14:12,691 --> 00:14:14,807
No one is neutral.

86
00:14:24,651 --> 00:14:25,651
CIA.

87
00:14:26,851 --> 00:14:28,125
They're tracking us!

88
00:14:28,771 --> 00:14:29,931
You!

89
00:14:34,891 --> 00:14:36,040
You're CIA?

90
00:14:36,211 --> 00:14:37,439
What? No. No!

91
00:14:37,611 --> 00:14:39,727
- You brought him here!
- No, he's a photographer.

92
00:14:41,531 --> 00:14:42,811
No!

93
00:14:48,051 --> 00:14:49,450
It's okay, Lois.

94
00:15:07,332 --> 00:15:08,332
Talon's down, sir.

95
00:15:09,012 --> 00:15:10,772
Python, we have lost our
asset on the ground.

96
00:15:10,972 --> 00:15:13,042
Repeat, we have lost our
asset on the ground.

97
00:15:13,252 --> 00:15:16,085
There's still a civilian in
the compound. We'll extract her.

98
00:15:16,252 --> 00:15:19,050
<i>Negative. RPA to engage.
Stand down and get black.</i>

99
00:15:19,612 --> 00:15:22,365
There'll be friendlies
in the blast zone, so...

100
00:15:22,572 --> 00:15:23,971
Call off the goddamn drone.

101
00:15:24,612 --> 00:15:27,251
Stand down is an order. Python?

102
00:15:27,812 --> 00:15:28,847
Let's move!

103
00:15:37,053 --> 00:15:38,168
I...

104
00:15:38,773 --> 00:15:39,773
I didn't know.

105
00:15:40,533 --> 00:15:45,129
Ignorance is not the same as innocence,

106
00:15:45,773 --> 00:15:46,967
Miss Lane.

107
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:16,767
Get up! Stand up!

108
00:16:29,174 --> 00:16:30,846
Quickly. He's coming.

109
00:16:44,014 --> 00:16:45,333
Inbound 2 mikes.

110
00:16:46,134 --> 00:16:48,250
<i>Passing Python now.</i>

111
00:16:56,534 --> 00:16:57,683
Move out!

112
00:17:05,094 --> 00:17:07,165
- Target locked.
- You are clear to engage.

113
00:17:07,855 --> 00:17:09,129
Armed hot and in range.

114
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:16,093
<i>Three.</i>

115
00:17:18,215 --> 00:17:20,251
Two. One.

116
00:17:30,815 --> 00:17:32,168
Link's been hit.

117
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:33,808
By what?

118
00:17:38,255 --> 00:17:41,452
Take one step,
you will see the inside of her head.

119
00:19:05,497 --> 00:19:08,170
<i>The women
in the village heard a noise.</i>

120
00:19:09,377 --> 00:19:12,926
Like the sky cracked open.

121
00:19:14,377 --> 00:19:18,052
He came down. Then came fire.

122
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:21,969
<i>Even worse came after.</i>

123
00:19:23,138 --> 00:19:24,617
<i>The government attacked.</i>

124
00:19:25,378 --> 00:19:27,414
<i>No mercy in the villages.</i>

125
00:19:28,778 --> 00:19:30,530
My parents tried to run.

126
00:19:35,218 --> 00:19:38,369
The world has been so caught up
with what Superman can do

127
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:41,331
that no one has asked what he should do.

128
00:19:44,178 --> 00:19:47,250
Let the record show that this
committee holds him responsible.

129
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:49,369
<i>He'll never answer to you.</i>

130
00:19:49,538 --> 00:19:54,009
He answers to no one.
Not even, I think, to God.

131
00:19:57,258 --> 00:19:58,407
<i>58 to nothing.</i>

132
00:19:58,578 --> 00:20:00,728
<i>Metropolis, again,
blowing out Gotham City.</i>

133
00:20:00,898 --> 00:20:02,954
<i>Really, only the diehards
are left in the stands.</i>

134
00:20:02,978 --> 00:20:05,715
<i>Delta Charlie 27.
Reports of screams coming from vacant home</i>

135
00:20:05,739 --> 00:20:07,457
<i>at 1939 Harborway.</i>

136
00:20:07,659 --> 00:20:09,115
<i>Tom, it's been great
working with you.</i>

137
00:20:09,139 --> 00:20:10,779
<i>I want to thank our
producer and director.</i>

138
00:20:10,939 --> 00:20:12,395
<i>- Now wait a second.
- I don't even want to suggest...</i>

139
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,875
<i>Delta Charlie 27, respond.</i>

140
00:20:13,899 --> 00:20:14,899
Just take a knee.

141
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:17,835
<i>They're lining up as if
Clarkson is gonna throw it deep here.</i>

142
00:20:17,859 --> 00:20:19,195
<i>- Don't tell me, Dave.
- Going to the end zone!</i>

143
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:20,915
<i>- This is unnecessary.
- Delta Charlie 27.</i>

144
00:20:20,939 --> 00:20:23,931
<i>Zeke Baker is open.
Baker with a touchdown catch!</i>

145
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:25,475
<i>I can't believe
I just watched that.</i>

146
00:20:25,499 --> 00:20:27,649
<i>Delta Charlie 27.
Do you copy?</i>

147
00:20:28,659 --> 00:20:29,887
10-4. We're on it.

148
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:31,936
<i>And now a fight breaks out.</i>

149
00:20:32,139 --> 00:20:35,449
<i>Gotham City, you know
how they are about their football team.</i>

150
00:20:35,659 --> 00:20:38,412
<i>Things could get ugly
in the city tonight.</i>

151
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,574
Go.

152
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,416
It's okay.

153
00:21:35,021 --> 00:21:36,136
It's okay.

154
00:21:36,301 --> 00:21:38,181
We're gonna help.
We're here to help.

155
00:21:39,421 --> 00:21:41,730
We're gonna get you out of here. Okay?

156
00:21:51,941 --> 00:21:53,374
I don't understand.

157
00:21:58,101 --> 00:21:59,819
<i>Please don't.
Please don't.</i>

158
00:22:08,381 --> 00:22:11,657
<i>Please. I don't know who he is.</i>

159
00:22:14,941 --> 00:22:16,260
<i>I don't know who he is!</i>

160
00:22:19,462 --> 00:22:21,259
<i>No!</i>

161
00:22:41,942 --> 00:22:43,170
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

162
00:23:22,263 --> 00:23:23,263
Christ!

163
00:23:23,423 --> 00:23:24,776
I saw him.

164
00:23:24,943 --> 00:23:26,820
<i>I never saw him before.
I... I didn't know.</i>

165
00:23:26,983 --> 00:23:28,416
You almost took my face off.

166
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:30,619
How about you don't shoot
the good guys, huh?

167
00:23:32,183 --> 00:23:34,060
Oh. Oh.

168
00:23:34,343 --> 00:23:36,174
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

169
00:23:36,343 --> 00:23:37,981
<i>He branded him.</i>

170
00:25:08,185 --> 00:25:10,141
- Hey.
- Hey.

171
00:25:10,345 --> 00:25:11,698
I was gonna cook.

172
00:25:12,225 --> 00:25:13,419
Surprise you.

173
00:25:17,986 --> 00:25:19,863
They held hearings about what happened.

174
00:25:22,026 --> 00:25:23,522
<i>- They're saying that...</i>
- I don't care.

175
00:25:23,546 --> 00:25:25,537
I don't care what they're saying.

176
00:25:27,546 --> 00:25:29,506
The woman I love could have
been blown up or shot.

177
00:25:30,106 --> 00:25:31,282
<i>Think of what could have happened.</i>

178
00:25:31,306 --> 00:25:33,615
Well, think about what did happen.

179
00:25:33,786 --> 00:25:36,061
I didn't kill those men,
if that's what they think.

180
00:25:36,226 --> 00:25:37,362
If that's what you're saying.

181
00:25:37,386 --> 00:25:40,059
No, I'm saying
I want to understand what happened.

182
00:25:41,986 --> 00:25:43,977
I'm saying thank you for saving my life.

183
00:25:44,146 --> 00:25:45,898
<i>I'm saying there's a cost.</i>

184
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:56,742
I just don't know if it's possible.

185
00:25:57,986 --> 00:25:59,465
Don't know if what's possible?

186
00:26:02,907 --> 00:26:04,420
For you to love me and be you.

187
00:26:32,907 --> 00:26:34,340
Clark!

188
00:26:35,307 --> 00:26:37,537
Clark, you're going
to flood the apartment.

189
00:26:37,747 --> 00:26:39,658
Mmm-hmm.

190
00:27:12,668 --> 00:27:13,668
You still working?

191
00:27:14,828 --> 00:27:17,217
You're getting slow
in your old age, Alfred.

192
00:27:17,388 --> 00:27:19,344
Comes to us all, Master Wayne.

193
00:27:20,628 --> 00:27:22,744
Even you got too old to die young.

194
00:27:24,828 --> 00:27:27,058
And not for lack of trying.

195
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:31,604
<i>Funnel-ferry butterbar.
Funnel-ferry butterbar.</i>

196
00:27:31,629 --> 00:27:33,045
<i>Funnel-ferry butterbar. Funnel-ferry...</i>

197
00:27:33,069 --> 00:27:34,709
There's nothing wrong
with the microphone.

198
00:27:35,909 --> 00:27:37,820
It's this new layer of armor.

199
00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:40,428
I'll just have to rewire.

200
00:27:42,309 --> 00:27:45,779
So, last night was productive?

201
00:27:47,229 --> 00:27:50,266
No. He's too low-level. He knew nothing.

202
00:27:50,629 --> 00:27:52,540
This is the man who knows things.

203
00:27:53,669 --> 00:27:56,741
Anatoli Knyazev. He's Russian.

204
00:27:57,389 --> 00:27:58,708
Contracts all over the globe,

205
00:27:58,869 --> 00:28:00,365
<i>but he's based out of the port of Gotham.</i>

206
00:28:00,389 --> 00:28:01,902
<i>Weapons and human trafficking.</i>

207
00:28:02,069 --> 00:28:03,829
<i>So the White Portuguese
is a Russian.</i>

208
00:28:03,869 --> 00:28:05,188
That's the theory.

209
00:28:05,389 --> 00:28:10,383
No. The theory is that the Russian
will lead me to the man himself.

210
00:28:10,709 --> 00:28:13,542
If he is, indeed, a "him."

211
00:28:14,789 --> 00:28:17,668
You don't even know if he exists.
Could be a phantasm.

212
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,900
One that wants to bring
a dirty bomb into Gotham?

213
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,742
Ah, high-stakes round.

214
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,548
<i>New rules.</i>

215
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,382
We're criminals, Alfred.

216
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:34,666
We've always been criminals.
Nothing's changed.

217
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,018
Oh, yes, it has, sir.

218
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:41,103
Everything's changed.

219
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,662
<i>Men fall from the sky.</i>

220
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:51,100
The gods hurl thunderbolts.

221
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:54,302
<i>Innocents die.</i>

222
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:57,382
<i>That's how it starts, sir.</i>

223
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:00,420
<i>The fever. The rage.</i>

224
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:03,424
The feeling of powerlessness.

225
00:29:05,111 --> 00:29:09,024
It turns good men cruel.

226
00:29:20,711 --> 00:29:21,905
<i>John, get D.</i>

227
00:29:24,031 --> 00:29:26,067
Ooh. Ah. Ahoy, ahoy!
I did not know you were here.

228
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:28,108
- Man on the marquee.
- Yeah, don't believe it.

229
00:29:28,271 --> 00:29:29,647
My father named the company
after himself.

230
00:29:29,671 --> 00:29:31,671
He was the Lex in front of the Corp.
How you doin'?

231
00:29:31,711 --> 00:29:32,905
Really great.

232
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:35,790
Really great? Good. Good.
Uh, follow me.

233
00:29:35,951 --> 00:29:38,704
No, uh, Dad started saying
that he named the company,

234
00:29:38,911 --> 00:29:40,424
after his kid at investor pitches.

235
00:29:40,591 --> 00:29:42,831
Rich old ladies.
They thought it was very cute, you know?

236
00:29:42,871 --> 00:29:44,589
"Write checks for Lex."

237
00:29:45,872 --> 00:29:47,863
You know, Dad was born in East Germany.

238
00:29:48,072 --> 00:29:50,188
He grew up eating stale crackers.

239
00:29:50,352 --> 00:29:52,432
And every other Saturday,
he had to march in a parade

240
00:29:52,592 --> 00:29:54,469
and wave flowers at tyrants.

241
00:29:54,632 --> 00:29:58,341
So, I think it was providence
that his son, me,

242
00:29:58,512 --> 00:29:59,661
would end up with this.

243
00:29:59,872 --> 00:30:02,340
One of my Rebuild Metropolis
crews found it.

244
00:30:02,512 --> 00:30:04,946
<i>Little souvenir from
the Kryptonian World Engine.</i>

245
00:30:05,112 --> 00:30:07,112
What does a rock have to do
with homeland security?

246
00:30:07,152 --> 00:30:08,824
Homeland security? Hmm.

247
00:30:08,992 --> 00:30:11,665
No, no, no, ma'am, planetary security.

248
00:30:12,152 --> 00:30:14,541
<i>The fragment
is of a radioactive xenomineral.</i>

249
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:16,942
<i>We suspected it might
have bio-interactions,</i>

250
00:30:17,112 --> 00:30:19,023
so we took the sample to AMRIID,

251
00:30:20,512 --> 00:30:23,549
where they keep the remains
of the Kryptonian decedent.

252
00:30:23,992 --> 00:30:27,189
And, when we exposed
General Zod to the mineral,

253
00:30:27,352 --> 00:30:28,580
this happened.

254
00:30:29,232 --> 00:30:33,545
<i>Profound biodegradation.
Decaying Kryptonian cells.</i>

255
00:30:33,713 --> 00:30:35,289
We concluded the mineral
could be weaponized

256
00:30:35,313 --> 00:30:36,713
if a large enough sample was found.

257
00:30:36,873 --> 00:30:40,104
And then, among the fishes, a whale.

258
00:30:40,473 --> 00:30:41,473
<i>Ah!</i>

259
00:30:41,793 --> 00:30:43,829
<i>Lying at the bottom of the Indian Ocean.</i>

260
00:30:44,433 --> 00:30:45,752
Emerald City.

261
00:30:46,873 --> 00:30:48,625
<i>Beautiful.</i>

262
00:30:48,793 --> 00:30:50,021
<i>Now, Rocky is radioactive,</i>

263
00:30:50,193 --> 00:30:53,390
but what he needs from you
is an import license.

264
00:30:53,553 --> 00:30:55,908
And why would we want to
weaponize this material?

265
00:30:56,113 --> 00:30:57,113
<i>As a deterrent.</i>

266
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:59,729
A silver bullet to keep in reserve,
to use against the Kryptonians,

267
00:30:59,753 --> 00:31:01,106
so the day does not come, madam,

268
00:31:01,313 --> 00:31:03,633
when your children are waving
daisies at a reviewing stand.

269
00:31:03,713 --> 00:31:05,226
Last I looked, the only one of those

270
00:31:05,393 --> 00:31:07,031
flying around up here was Superman.

271
00:31:07,193 --> 00:31:10,230
Ha-ha, yes. Superman.
Yeah, but there are...

272
00:31:10,393 --> 00:31:11,393
<i>There are more of them.</i>

273
00:31:11,553 --> 00:31:12,747
The metahuman thesis.

274
00:31:12,953 --> 00:31:14,227
<i>Yes, the metahuman thesis.</i>

275
00:31:14,393 --> 00:31:15,668
<i>More likely than not</i>

276
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,705
these exceptional beings live among us.

277
00:31:17,914 --> 00:31:20,064
The basis of our myths.
Gods among men upon

278
00:31:20,234 --> 00:31:21,792
our little blue planet here.

279
00:31:24,474 --> 00:31:26,385
Now, you don't have to use
a silver bullet.

280
00:31:26,594 --> 00:31:28,664
But if you forge one...

281
00:31:28,874 --> 00:31:30,227
Well, then

282
00:31:30,474 --> 00:31:32,749
we don't have to depend
upon the kindness of monsters.

283
00:31:37,434 --> 00:31:39,789
There are ways we can help each other.

284
00:31:41,154 --> 00:31:43,224
Would you step
into my office here?

285
00:31:47,194 --> 00:31:48,422
Yes.

286
00:31:48,954 --> 00:31:50,672
What's your wish list?

287
00:31:54,514 --> 00:31:57,267
Access to the wreck of
the crashed Kryptonian ship?

288
00:31:59,394 --> 00:32:00,464
Done.

289
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:52,509
The complete remains
of the dead alien for testing.

290
00:32:54,116 --> 00:32:55,344
You want Zod's body?

291
00:32:56,596 --> 00:32:57,596
Okay.

292
00:33:12,196 --> 00:33:14,505
Mmm.

293
00:33:33,957 --> 00:33:35,185
It's cherry.

294
00:33:38,197 --> 00:33:39,516
Mmm-mmm.

295
00:33:41,717 --> 00:33:43,150
<i>Because the time has come</i>

296
00:33:43,357 --> 00:33:46,474
<i>for the world to hear
the other side of the story.</i>

297
00:33:46,637 --> 00:33:49,868
<i>They say that Superman is a hero.
Okay, but whose hero?</i>

298
00:33:50,037 --> 00:33:52,187
<i>If Superman were here right now,</i>

299
00:33:52,357 --> 00:33:53,756
<i>what would you want to say to him?</i>

300
00:33:54,397 --> 00:33:56,388
<i>That my family, too, had dreams.</i>

301
00:33:58,557 --> 00:34:02,914
<i>To look him in his eye
and ask him how he decides</i>

302
00:34:03,597 --> 00:34:05,030
<i>which lives count.</i>

303
00:34:05,797 --> 00:34:07,469
<i>And which ones do not.</i>

304
00:35:17,799 --> 00:35:19,152
Sir, get down.

305
00:35:20,759 --> 00:35:23,193
Sir, I said get down!

306
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:24,553
<i>Now!</i>

307
00:35:26,319 --> 00:35:27,832
<i>Can we get some backup here?</i>

308
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,110
<i>Hey! Hey! Don't do it!</i>

309
00:35:31,279 --> 00:35:32,394

Don't let them take your lunch money.

<i>and the felony charge of
making terrorist threats.</i>

326
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,232
<i>That carries up to 40 years in prison.</i>

327
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,594
Poor son of a bitch.

Is she in?

334
00:37:12,842 --> 00:37:14,241
No, she's been gone.

<i>What'd she do, officer?</i>

336

I'm not a cop. I'm a reporter.

337
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:23,920
The young lady living here...

338
00:37:24,402 --> 00:37:25,755
She hasn't been back.

339
00:37:25,962 --> 00:37:28,202
In fact, if she's smart,
then she's got out of this city.

340
00:37:28,282 --> 00:37:31,115
And you need to
get out of here before dark.

341

<i>Don't listen to that nonsense.</i>

Only people scared of him,
people who got reason to be.

344
00:37:38,282 --> 00:37:39,431
Scared of who?

345
00:37:39,642 --> 00:37:42,315
There's a new kind of mean in him.

346
00:37:43,042 --> 00:37:44,236
He is angry.

347
00:37:46,402 --> 00:37:47,881

00:38:26,603 --> 00:38:27,718
Thank you.

353
00:38:36,683 --> 00:38:38,163
The house treats luck like an insult.

354
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:41,836
Good luck for one is always
his brother's misfortune.

355
00:38:46,484 --> 00:38:47,900
Three nights with a Bolshoi ballerina,

356
00:38:47,924 --> 00:38:49,243
that line was all she taught me.

357
00:38:49,764 --> 00:38:52,756
Not all, I'm sure. Good evening.

<i>It's like a one-man
reign of terror.</i>

This Bat vigilante has been
consistently targeting the port

and the adjacent projects and tenements.

361
00:39:06,044 --> 00:39:08,100
And, as far as I can tell,
the cops are actually helping him.

00:39:08,124 --> 00:39:10,877
"Crime Wave in Gotham."

Did you file the football yet?

365
00:39:15,884 --> 00:39:17,761
Why aren't we covering this?

366
00:39:17,924 --> 00:39:19,644
<i>Poor people don't buy papers?</i>

367
00:39:19,764 --> 00:39:21,834
People don't buy papers, period, Kent.

368
00:39:22,004 --> 00:39:23,180
Perry, when you assign a story,

369
00:39:23,204 --> 00:39:24,844
you're making a choice about who matters.

370
00:39:24,964 --> 00:39:26,477
And who's worth it.

371
00:39:26,644 --> 00:39:28,078
Good morning, Smallville.

372
00:39:28,245 --> 00:39:31,874
The American conscience died
with Robert, Martin, and John.

373
00:39:32,085 --> 00:39:33,234
<i>Sorry. I'm sorry.</i>

374
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:38,122
No match. My guys in the crime lab
never seen one before.

375
00:39:39,765 --> 00:39:41,721
It's called a bullet.
You shoot people with them.

376
00:39:41,885 --> 00:39:44,718
Recovered from the scene
of the firefight in the desert.

377
00:39:44,885 --> 00:39:47,001
Not sold anywhere
commercially in the world,

378
00:39:47,165 --> 00:39:48,200
even black market.

00:39:48,365 --> 00:39:49,365
<i>So?</i>

380
00:39:49,605 --> 00:39:51,357
So who gave prototype military rounds

381
00:39:51,565 --> 00:39:53,044
to Tuareg fighters in the Sahara?

382
00:39:53,205 --> 00:39:54,604
You're the reporter. Tell me.

383
00:39:54,765 --> 00:39:56,461
I think that the US government
is arming the rebels

384
00:39:56,485 --> 00:39:58,301
<i>while claiming to support
the elected government.</i>

385
00:39:58,325 --> 00:39:59,804
The Ask, Lois.

386
00:40:04,805 --> 00:40:06,565
Flight to D.C. tonight.
Couple of days there.

387
00:40:06,605 --> 00:40:08,084
Go.

388
00:40:08,245 --> 00:40:10,281
Coach. No extra legroom.

389
00:40:13,046 --> 00:40:14,240
Economy plus.

390
00:40:14,406 --> 00:40:15,441
Coach!

391
00:40:16,886 --> 00:40:18,956
So, why didn't you tell me?

392
00:40:22,126 --> 00:40:23,400
You're digging up snakes, Lo.

393
00:40:24,606 --> 00:40:26,119
It's kind of dangerous.

394
00:40:26,286 --> 00:40:28,197
That is why I didn't tell you.

395
00:40:28,406 --> 00:40:30,166
Lane, don't you
have a plane to catch?

396
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:31,921
Yes, sir.

397
00:40:33,606 --> 00:40:35,915
Benefit for the Library of Metropolis.

398
00:40:36,086 --> 00:40:38,998
Someone on the committee
requested that Clark Kent cover it.

399
00:40:39,166 --> 00:40:42,078
Probably some old charity crone
who's got a thing for nerds.

400
00:40:52,686 --> 00:40:53,801
<i>Senator.</i>

401
00:40:55,006 --> 00:40:56,486
Little bourbon before lunch?

402
00:40:56,647 --> 00:40:58,603
My driver's outside. I can't stay.

403
00:40:58,767 --> 00:40:59,995
No bourbon?

404
00:41:00,607 --> 00:41:02,040
Kentucky girl like yourself?

405
00:41:03,247 --> 00:41:04,247
Hmm.

406
00:41:04,727 --> 00:41:07,525
My dad always said that Kentucky mash

407
00:41:07,727 --> 00:41:09,638
was the secret to health.

408
00:41:09,807 --> 00:41:11,240
Mmm.

409
00:41:12,207 --> 00:41:13,640
This was his room.

410
00:41:15,647 --> 00:41:17,239
I kept it just the same.

411
00:41:19,647 --> 00:41:20,647
Mmm.

412
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:26,917
"Maybe one day Dad'll come back
if I just keep everything the same."

413
00:41:27,407 --> 00:41:28,681
That is silly.

414
00:41:30,527 --> 00:41:32,722
The magical thinking of orphan boys.

415
00:41:32,887 --> 00:41:35,321
I'm blocking the import
license for your mineral.

416
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,840
The redcapes are coming.

417
00:41:46,528 --> 00:41:48,439
The redcapes are coming.

418
00:41:48,968 --> 00:41:50,117
Hmm...

419
00:41:53,008 --> 00:41:54,407
You and your hearings.

420
00:41:58,368 --> 00:42:00,928
Galloping through the streets to warn us.

421
00:42:02,888 --> 00:42:06,085
One if by land, two if by air.

422
00:42:06,328 --> 00:42:07,397
Mmm.

423
00:42:12,208 --> 00:42:15,245
Do you know the oldest lie
in America, Senator?

424
00:42:15,448 --> 00:42:16,448
Can I call you June?

425
00:42:16,608 --> 00:42:18,087
You can call me whatever you like.

426
00:42:19,128 --> 00:42:21,961
Take a bucket of piss and
call it Granny's Peach Tea.

427
00:42:22,168 --> 00:42:23,168
Mmm-hmm.

428
00:42:23,448 --> 00:42:26,247
Take a weapon of assassination
and call it deterrence.

429
00:42:28,529 --> 00:42:30,042
You won't fool a fly or me.

430
00:42:32,129 --> 00:42:33,642
I'm not gonna drink it.

431
00:42:38,769 --> 00:42:41,044
You don't think Dad would mind, do you?

432
00:42:41,209 --> 00:42:45,964
If I changed just...
Just one thing in this room?

433
00:42:48,449 --> 00:42:50,724
Because that should be upside-down.

434
00:42:53,009 --> 00:42:54,920
We know better now, don't we?

435
00:42:55,129 --> 00:42:58,166
The devils don't come
from Hell beneath us. No.

436
00:42:59,169 --> 00:43:00,602
No, they come from the sky.

437
00:44:57,532 --> 00:44:58,532
Oh.

438
00:44:58,772 --> 00:45:00,569
I hope the next generation of Waynes

439
00:45:00,732 --> 00:45:02,802
won't inherit an empty wine cellar.

440
00:45:04,732 --> 00:45:07,769
Not that there's likely
to be a next generation.

441
00:45:09,052 --> 00:45:10,087
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

442
00:45:13,412 --> 00:45:16,563
This is every call made
from the Russian's phone.

443
00:45:16,972 --> 00:45:19,406
Two mentions of business
with the White Portuguese.

444
00:45:19,612 --> 00:45:22,365
And it's continually
transmitting blacked-out data

445
00:45:22,572 --> 00:45:25,610
to the personal residence
of Alexander Luthor.

446
00:45:25,773 --> 00:45:29,049
You think Lex Luthor
is the White Portuguese?

447
00:45:30,773 --> 00:45:34,083
I can't see that he needs the income
from imported arms.

448
00:45:34,293 --> 00:45:35,669
Regardless, I'll need to put
a leech at his house,

449
00:45:35,693 --> 00:45:36,842
and I'm gonna need the suit.

450
00:45:37,013 --> 00:45:38,969
The Bat interrogated six people

451
00:45:39,213 --> 00:45:40,965
and came away with nothing.

452
00:45:42,773 --> 00:45:44,923
It was Bruce Wayne
that got the information.

453
00:45:45,133 --> 00:45:48,091
Well, Bruce Wayne can't
break into Lex Luthor's house.

454
00:45:48,253 --> 00:45:49,766
Bruce Wayne won't have to.

455
00:45:51,893 --> 00:45:53,212
He's been invited.

456
00:47:05,895 --> 00:47:07,374
Who's that?

457
00:47:08,695 --> 00:47:11,050
You must be new to
the "let them eat cake" beat.

458
00:47:11,215 --> 00:47:12,807
That is Bruce Wayne.

459
00:47:13,895 --> 00:47:16,125
<i>Philanthropist, bibliophile...</i>

460
00:47:16,335 --> 00:47:19,372
True friend of the Library of Metropolis.

461
00:47:19,535 --> 00:47:20,934
Mr. Lex Luthor.

462
00:47:21,335 --> 00:47:23,530
Me? Ah. Okay.

463
00:47:27,935 --> 00:47:29,527
Nicky. Uh...

464
00:47:30,175 --> 00:47:31,847
<i>You're embarrassing me.
Um...</i>

465
00:47:32,535 --> 00:47:33,888
<i>Speech, speech. Uh...</i>

466
00:47:34,575 --> 00:47:35,724
<i>Blah, blah, blah. Uh...</i>

467
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:37,895
<i>Open bar.</i>

468
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:40,289
<i>The end.</i>

469
00:47:40,856 --> 00:47:42,448
<i>Uh...</i>

470
00:47:43,536 --> 00:47:46,289
The word "philanthropist"
comes from the Greek.

471
00:47:46,456 --> 00:47:48,094
Meaning a lover of humanity.

472
00:47:48,976 --> 00:47:51,206
<i>It was coined about 2,500 years ago.</i>

473
00:47:51,376 --> 00:47:52,934
All right. Where am I going, Alfred?

474
00:47:53,096 --> 00:47:55,087
Go past the elevator.

475
00:47:55,256 --> 00:47:56,575
Do a left.

476
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:58,531
<i>That's right, must be.</i>

477
00:47:59,576 --> 00:48:01,407
<i>It's in the service corridor
in the basement.</i>

478
00:48:01,576 --> 00:48:02,929
<i>Go down the stairs.</i>

479
00:48:03,096 --> 00:48:05,690
<i>Gods and men.
Prometheus went with us.</i>

480
00:48:05,856 --> 00:48:08,416
And he ruined Zeus' plan
to destroy mankind,

481
00:48:08,616 --> 00:48:10,216
and for that he was given a thunderbolt.

482
00:48:11,496 --> 00:48:13,452
<i>Hmm, that seems unfair.</i>

483
00:48:14,536 --> 00:48:16,447
<i>On a serious note,
the Library of Metropolis...</i>

484
00:48:16,616 --> 00:48:18,592
Go to the stairs. You saw them
on your way in. Down the stairs.

485
00:48:18,616 --> 00:48:21,767
<i>But at one time,
Dad could not buy them. No.</i>

486
00:48:21,936 --> 00:48:23,432
<i>My father could not afford
books growing up.</i>

487
00:48:23,456 --> 00:48:25,857
<i>He had to root through the garbage
for yesterday's newspaper.</i>

488
00:48:28,377 --> 00:48:30,177
All right.
You got the kitchens on your right.

489
00:48:31,097 --> 00:48:32,576
<i>Do a left.</i>

490
00:48:32,737 --> 00:48:34,737
Right in front of you.
That's where you want to be.

491
00:48:50,937 --> 00:48:52,290
May I help you, Mr. Wayne?

492
00:48:53,537 --> 00:48:54,936
I just...

493
00:48:55,297 --> 00:48:57,652
I thought the bathroom was down here.
I must have...

494
00:48:58,457 --> 00:49:01,813
That last martini was
two too many, I think.

495
00:49:01,977 --> 00:49:03,296
Men's room is upstairs.

496
00:49:03,457 --> 00:49:04,572
Great. I'm okay.

497
00:49:05,577 --> 00:49:07,215
I like those shoes.

498
00:49:11,098 --> 00:49:13,612
I can't stay down here, Alfred.

499
00:49:14,018 --> 00:49:15,497
<i>Go upstairs and socialize.</i>

500
00:49:15,658 --> 00:49:18,126
Some young lady from Metropolis
will make you honest.

501
00:49:19,418 --> 00:49:21,852
In your dreams, Alfred.

502
00:49:22,538 --> 00:49:24,017
<i>Books are knowledge,</i>

503
00:49:24,178 --> 00:49:26,851
and knowledge is power,
and I am...

504
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:29,131
No. Uh, um...

505
00:49:29,298 --> 00:49:32,017
No. What am I? I...
What was I saying? No.

506
00:49:34,378 --> 00:49:35,731
The bittersweet pain among men

507
00:49:35,898 --> 00:49:38,810
is having knowledge with
no power, because...

508
00:49:39,858 --> 00:49:41,974
Because that is paradoxical!
And, um...

509
00:49:45,138 --> 00:49:47,049
Thank you for coming.

510
00:49:48,618 --> 00:49:49,846
<i>Please drink. Drink.</i>

511
00:49:59,179 --> 00:50:03,138
Mr. Wayne? Mr. Wayne?
Clark Kent, Daily Planet.

512
00:50:03,299 --> 00:50:05,255
My foundation has
already issued a statement

513
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:07,375
in support of books.

514
00:50:07,539 --> 00:50:08,733
- Sir?
- Um...

515
00:50:09,979 --> 00:50:12,368
Wow. Pretty girl. Bad habit.
Don't quote me. All right?

516
00:50:13,019 --> 00:50:15,059
What's your position on
the Bat vigilante in Gotham?

517
00:50:17,059 --> 00:50:19,812
<i>Daily Planet.</i> Do I own this one?
Or is that the other guy?

518
00:50:20,019 --> 00:50:23,170
Civil liberties are being
trampled on in your city.

519
00:50:23,379 --> 00:50:24,619
Good people are living in fear.

520
00:50:27,419 --> 00:50:29,535
Don't believe everything you hear, son.

521
00:50:29,699 --> 00:50:33,089
I've seen it, Mr. Wayne.
He thinks he's above the law.

522
00:50:36,259 --> 00:50:39,377
<i>The Daily Planet</i> criticizing
those who think they're above the law

523
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:42,577
is a little hypocritical,
wouldn't you say?

524
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:46,260
Considering every time
your hero saves a cat out of a tree,

525
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:48,570
you write a puff piece editorial

526
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:51,340
about an alien who, if he wanted to,

527
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,172
could burn the whole place down.

528
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:57,013
There wouldn't be a damn thing
we could do to stop him.

529
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:02,097
Most of the world doesn't
share your opinion, Mr. Wayne.

530
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:04,820
Maybe it's the Gotham City in me.

531
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:08,575
We just have a bad history
with freaks dressed like clowns.

532
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:12,259
<i>Boys! Um!</i>

533
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:14,775
Bruce Wayne meets Clark Kent. Ha!

534
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:16,771
I love it.
I love bringing people together.

535
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:17,940
How are we?

536
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:19,699
- Lex.
- Hello. Good.

537
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:22,055
Hi, hello, Lex, it is a pleasure.

538
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:23,290
Wow! That is a good grip!

539
00:51:23,461 --> 00:51:26,533
You should not pick a fight
with this person.

540
00:51:26,701 --> 00:51:29,117
So, after all these years,
we finally got you over to Metropolis.

541
00:51:29,141 --> 00:51:30,701
Well, I thought I'd come drink you dry.

542
00:51:30,821 --> 00:51:31,821
Well, you're welcome.

543
00:51:32,021 --> 00:51:33,197
You should hop the harbor
more often, though.

544
00:51:33,221 --> 00:51:34,381
I'd love to show you my labs.

545
00:51:34,461 --> 00:51:36,497
Maybe we could partner on something.

546
00:51:36,981 --> 00:51:39,131
My R and D is up to all sorts of no good.

547
00:51:43,901 --> 00:51:45,050
That's seven minutes.

548
00:51:45,221 --> 00:51:47,132
<i>Looks like the transfer's complete.</i>

549
00:51:47,661 --> 00:51:48,810
- Mr. Luthor.
- Yes?

550
00:51:48,981 --> 00:51:50,653
- The governor.
- Governor.

551
00:51:50,821 --> 00:51:52,140
- Excuse me.
- Next time.

552
00:51:52,341 --> 00:51:53,341
Governor! Hi!

553
00:51:53,501 --> 00:51:55,378
Lex, it's good to see you.

554
00:52:33,782 --> 00:52:34,782
Excuse me.

555
00:53:40,984 --> 00:53:43,373
<i>We, as a population on this planet,</i>

556
00:53:43,624 --> 00:53:44,864
<i>have been looking for a savior.</i>

557
00:53:44,944 --> 00:53:47,253
<i>90% of people believe in a higher power,</i>

558
00:53:47,464 --> 00:53:48,738
<i>and every religion believes</i>

559
00:53:48,904 --> 00:53:50,781
<i>in some sort of messianic figure.</i>

560
00:53:50,944 --> 00:53:53,936
<i>And when this savior character
actually comes to Earth,</i>

561
00:53:54,104 --> 00:53:56,140
<i>we want to make him abide by our rules?</i>

562
00:53:56,344 --> 00:53:58,300
<i>We have to understand that
this a paradigm shift.</i>

563
00:53:58,464 --> 00:54:00,853
<i>We have to start thinking
beyond politics.</i>

564
00:54:01,024 --> 00:54:03,584
<i>Are there any moral
constraints on this person?</i>

565
00:54:03,704 --> 00:54:05,535
<i>We have international law.</i>

566
00:54:05,704 --> 00:54:08,423
<i>On this Earth,
every act is a political act.</i>

567
00:54:08,624 --> 00:54:10,501
<i>Is it really surprising</i>

568
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:12,894
<i>that the most powerful man in the world</i>

569
00:54:13,064 --> 00:54:15,532
<i>should be a figure of controversy?</i>

570
00:54:16,344 --> 00:54:18,812
<i>Uh, to have
an individual engaging</i>

571
00:54:18,984 --> 00:54:21,020
<i>in these state-level interventions</i>

572
00:54:21,185 --> 00:54:22,538
<i>should give us all pause.</i>

573
00:54:23,305 --> 00:54:25,201
<i>Human beings
have a horrible track record</i>

574
00:54:25,225 --> 00:54:27,739
<i>of following people with great power</i>

575
00:54:27,905 --> 00:54:31,136
<i>down paths that led to
huge human atrocities.</i>

576
00:54:31,305 --> 00:54:33,944
<i>We have always
created icons in our own image.</i>

577
00:54:34,105 --> 00:54:37,415
<i>What we've done is
we project ourselves onto him.</i>

578
00:54:37,585 --> 00:54:41,100
<i>The fact is, maybe he's not
some sort of devil or Jesus character.</i>

579
00:54:41,305 --> 00:54:43,535
<i>Maybe he's just a guy
trying to do the right thing.</i>

580
00:54:43,705 --> 00:54:46,663
<i>We're talking
about a being whose very existence</i>

581
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:50,659
<i>challenges our own
sense of priority in the universe.</i>

582
00:54:51,465 --> 00:54:52,693
<i>And you go back to Copernicus,</i>

583
00:54:52,905 --> 00:54:54,258
<i>where he restored the Sun</i>

584
00:54:54,425 --> 00:54:55,865
<i>in the center of the known universe,</i>

585
00:54:55,945 --> 00:54:57,219
<i>displacing Earth.</i>

586
00:54:57,385 --> 00:54:59,103
<i>And you get to Darwinian evolution,</i>

587
00:54:59,265 --> 00:55:01,221
<i>and you find out we're not
special on this Earth,</i>

588
00:55:01,385 --> 00:55:04,183
<i>we're just one among other lifeforms.</i>

589
00:55:04,345 --> 00:55:05,824
<i>And now we learn that we're not even</i>

590
00:55:05,986 --> 00:55:09,581
<i>special in the entire universe
because there is Superman.</i>

591
00:55:10,506 --> 00:55:13,976
<i>There he is. An alien among us.</i>

592
00:55:14,146 --> 00:55:15,261
<i>We're not alone.</i>

593
00:55:16,186 --> 00:55:18,256
<i>Are you,
as a United States senator,</i>

594
00:55:18,426 --> 00:55:22,704
<i>personally comfortable saying
to a grieving parent,</i>

595
00:55:22,866 --> 00:55:26,381
<i>"Superman could have saved your child,</i>

596
00:55:26,546 --> 00:55:30,505
<i>"but on principle,
we did not want him to act"?</i>

597
00:55:30,666 --> 00:55:32,418
<i>I'm not saying he shouldn't act.</i>

598
00:55:32,586 --> 00:55:34,383
<i>I'm saying he shouldn't act unilaterally.</i>

599
00:55:34,546 --> 00:55:36,582
<i>What are we talking about here, then?</i>

600
00:55:36,746 --> 00:55:39,214
<i>Must there be a Superman?</i>

601
00:55:41,706 --> 00:55:42,821
<i>There is.</i>

602
00:55:55,587 --> 00:55:56,587
<i>Hello?</i>

603
00:55:57,067 --> 00:55:58,102
<i>Mom?</i>

604
00:55:58,307 --> 00:55:59,501
Clark!

605
00:56:00,667 --> 00:56:02,897
What is it? What's wrong?

606
00:56:03,067 --> 00:56:05,058
<i>No. Nothing. I just...</i>

607
00:56:08,227 --> 00:56:09,580
Hi.

608
00:56:11,787 --> 00:56:12,787
Hi.

609
00:56:15,467 --> 00:56:17,105
How come Dad never left Kansas?

610
00:56:21,427 --> 00:56:23,099
Well, he just...

611
00:56:23,587 --> 00:56:25,100
You know how he was.

612
00:56:25,747 --> 00:56:27,544
"What do I need to travel for?

613
00:56:27,747 --> 00:56:29,419
"I'm already there."

614
00:56:31,627 --> 00:56:33,185
Just wish it was more simple.

615
00:56:36,028 --> 00:56:37,381
My baby boy.

616
00:56:39,228 --> 00:56:41,583
Nothing was ever simple.

617
00:56:48,908 --> 00:56:50,466
An odd little duck.

618
00:56:52,908 --> 00:56:53,908
<i>Hmm!</i>

619
00:56:54,148 --> 00:56:55,508
I've never seen a metal like this.

620
00:56:57,468 --> 00:57:00,460
Could be DARPA black box.

621
00:57:00,628 --> 00:57:02,141
Who could find out?

622
00:57:02,308 --> 00:57:04,026
Nobody who'd want to.

623
00:57:04,188 --> 00:57:06,827
Maybe they gave them
out to the rebels to test in theater.

624
00:57:06,988 --> 00:57:09,138
Using live soldiers as guinea pigs?

625
00:57:10,148 --> 00:57:12,378
This is what makes you
such a good reporter.

626
00:57:12,948 --> 00:57:14,268
Stuff like this still shocks you.

627
00:57:37,229 --> 00:57:39,697
It don't come off!
It don't come off!

628
00:57:40,389 --> 00:57:41,663
Prisoner transfer!

629
00:57:42,349 --> 00:57:44,943
You can't put me in general, man.
They gonna kill me.

630
00:57:45,109 --> 00:57:46,245
Hey, you can't bring me to general.

631
00:57:46,269 --> 00:57:48,005
You should be thanking
the tax payers of Metropolis

632
00:57:48,029 --> 00:57:49,348
for taking in your branded ass.

633
00:57:49,509 --> 00:57:50,725
- Sign here, please.
- I'm marked, man.

634
00:57:50,749 --> 00:57:52,165
You know what they do
to people with this on them?

635
00:57:52,189 --> 00:57:53,565
He's only a criminal.

636
00:57:53,589 --> 00:57:55,389
- This way! Let's go!
- They're gonna kill me!

637
00:57:55,749 --> 00:57:57,429
<i>- They're gonna kill me!</i>
- Let's go!

638
00:57:57,549 --> 00:57:59,904
Keefe. You made bail.

639
00:58:00,069 --> 00:58:01,104
Open two.

640
00:58:06,830 --> 00:58:07,979
Who paid?

641
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:21,549
Who the hell are you?

642
00:58:27,110 --> 00:58:28,110
Just a man.

643
00:58:28,310 --> 00:58:30,665
Yeah? Well, what the fuck do you want?

644
00:58:35,710 --> 00:58:36,990
To help you stand for something.

645
00:58:42,430 --> 00:58:43,863
Your three o'clock's here.

646
00:58:53,871 --> 00:58:56,260
He made me half a man.

647
00:58:58,231 --> 00:59:01,940
My wife walked out on me.

648
00:59:04,351 --> 00:59:07,423
I can't even piss standing up.

649
00:59:08,591 --> 00:59:10,104
<i>Let me face him.</i>

650
00:59:12,271 --> 00:59:13,465
You'll take care of it?

651
00:59:15,271 --> 00:59:16,420
Good.

652
00:59:42,112 --> 00:59:43,227
What?

653
01:00:01,752 --> 01:00:03,105
Wrong room, miss.

654
01:00:03,552 --> 01:00:04,587
Secretary Swanwick,

655
01:00:04,832 --> 01:00:06,472
you haven't been
returning my phone calls.

656
01:00:08,632 --> 01:00:10,588
Miss Lane, if you'd like an interview,

657
01:00:10,752 --> 01:00:13,141
Major Farris is just outside that door.

658
01:00:13,352 --> 01:00:15,183
You're treating me like a stranger?

659
01:00:16,832 --> 01:00:18,424
I'm treating you like a reporter.

660
01:00:18,632 --> 01:00:22,467
All right. Is the US providing
experimental military arms

661
01:00:22,633 --> 01:00:23,668
to rebels in Africa?

662
01:00:24,353 --> 01:00:26,742
You know, with balls like yours,

663
01:00:26,953 --> 01:00:28,671
you belong in here.

664
01:00:28,873 --> 01:00:31,512
What's your source on this?
A tin foil hat?

665
01:00:32,033 --> 01:00:34,024
No, not tin. But it's metal.

666
01:00:34,193 --> 01:00:35,865
Fired in the Superman incident.

667
01:00:36,033 --> 01:00:39,389
Experts at the Pentagon can't ID it.
We haven't been told the truth.

668
01:00:39,593 --> 01:00:40,708
Here's the truth.

669
01:00:40,873 --> 01:00:43,553
A reporter got greedy for a scoop
and went where she shouldn't have.

670
01:00:43,713 --> 01:00:45,704
Superman acted like some rogue combatant

671
01:00:45,873 --> 01:00:47,511
to rescue her, and people died.

672
01:00:48,593 --> 01:00:51,232
Don't invent a conspiracy
theory to put back his halo.

673
01:00:52,633 --> 01:00:53,702
Or yours.

674
01:00:54,913 --> 01:00:56,232
- Major.
<i>- Sir.</i>

675
01:00:57,233 --> 01:00:58,507
<i>So.</i>

676
01:00:58,673 --> 01:01:00,550
I logged into your Dropbox to find copy.

677
01:01:01,353 --> 01:01:02,672
There's copy all right.

678
01:01:03,994 --> 01:01:06,713
But nothing about football.

679
01:01:07,714 --> 01:01:10,069
Nothing about the friends
of the Metropolis Library,

680
01:01:11,074 --> 01:01:13,793
just the goddamn Gotham Bat thing

681
01:01:13,954 --> 01:01:15,467
I told you not to pursue.

682
01:01:15,634 --> 01:01:18,074
If the police won't help,
the press has to do the right thing.

683
01:01:18,194 --> 01:01:19,450
You don't get to decide
what the right thing is.

684
01:01:19,474 --> 01:01:22,068
When the Planet was founded,
it stood for something, Perry.

685
01:01:22,314 --> 01:01:26,102
And so could you if it was 1938,
but it's not 1938.

686
01:01:26,274 --> 01:01:29,311
WPA ain't hiring no more.
Apples don't cost a nickel.

687
01:01:29,514 --> 01:01:32,392
Not in here, not out there.
You drop this thing!

688
01:01:34,954 --> 01:01:37,673
Nobody cares about Clark Kent
taking on the Batman.

689
01:01:39,914 --> 01:01:41,666
<i>So apparently Superman</i>

690
01:01:41,834 --> 01:01:43,874
<i>doesn't want us to think of him
as American anymore.</i>

691
01:01:44,074 --> 01:01:45,268
<i>And really, why would we?</i>

692
01:01:45,434 --> 01:01:47,265
<i>Aside from the red and blue costume.</i>

693
01:01:47,434 --> 01:01:49,107
<i>And, I don't know, the fact that he has</i>

694
01:01:49,315 --> 01:01:51,590
<i>one-third of the USA's
initials on his chest.</i>

695
01:01:51,755 --> 01:01:53,331
<i>I assume the only reason he's not wearing</i>

696
01:01:53,355 --> 01:01:55,550
<i>the Declaration of
Independence as a cape is...</i>

697
01:01:56,315 --> 01:01:57,555
<i>He thinks it's too on-the-nose.</i>

698
01:01:57,795 --> 01:01:59,515
<i>- What is going on back here?</i>
- No.

699
01:01:59,675 --> 01:02:01,108
Guys, come on. Let's go.

700
01:02:01,275 --> 01:02:02,571
<i>Get yourselves together and get out there.</i>

701
01:02:02,595 --> 01:02:03,891
<i>Get those glasses on those trays.</i>

702
01:02:03,915 --> 01:02:05,195
<i>We got thirsty people out there.</i>

703
01:02:14,355 --> 01:02:15,708
I wonder, would you excuse us?

704
01:02:15,875 --> 01:02:17,995
- There's something I'd like to show you.
- I'm sorry.

705
01:02:19,035 --> 01:02:22,152
Now some scholars insist
that it never happened...

706
01:02:22,315 --> 01:02:24,146
But I believe it's the action

707
01:02:24,315 --> 01:02:28,308
perfectly in keeping with a king
who was also a psychopathic killer.

708
01:02:29,195 --> 01:02:32,744
For me, it's the culmination
of 40 years curating.

709
01:02:32,996 --> 01:02:35,954
And I can't believe it,
but I've finally got it here.

710
01:02:37,276 --> 01:02:39,267
It's the Sword of Alexander.

711
01:02:40,756 --> 01:02:43,589
It's the blade that cut the Gordian knot.

712
01:02:45,996 --> 01:02:47,315
It's a triumph.

713
01:02:47,516 --> 01:02:48,665
Yes.

714
01:02:48,876 --> 01:02:50,514
<i>- Enjoy.
- Thank you.</i>

715
01:02:57,956 --> 01:02:59,514
It's a fake.

716
01:02:59,796 --> 01:03:02,310
The real one was sold
in '98 on the black market.

717
01:03:02,556 --> 01:03:03,591
And now it hangs...

718
01:03:03,756 --> 01:03:05,633
Over the bed of the Sultan of Hajar.

719
01:03:09,196 --> 01:03:10,595
Excuse me.

720
01:03:11,836 --> 01:03:13,713
Excuse me, miss.

721
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:17,107
The other night you took something
that doesn't belong to you.

722
01:03:17,276 --> 01:03:18,676
Stealing's not polite.

723
01:03:19,397 --> 01:03:22,036
Is it stealing if you steal
from another thief?

724
01:03:23,797 --> 01:03:25,355
Who are you?

725
01:03:25,517 --> 01:03:28,031
Someone interested
in the same man you are.

726
01:03:29,277 --> 01:03:30,551
Is that right?

727
01:03:30,717 --> 01:03:33,993
I believe Mr. Luthor has a photograph
that belongs to me.

728
01:03:34,157 --> 01:03:35,476
Did you get it?

729
01:03:35,677 --> 01:03:37,349
As it happens, no, I didn't.

730
01:03:38,157 --> 01:03:41,035
The data you copied has
military-grade encryption.

731
01:03:42,557 --> 01:03:44,752
You know, I bet with that dress,

732
01:03:44,917 --> 01:03:47,556
9 out of 10 men will let you
get away with anything.

733
01:03:47,717 --> 01:03:48,945
But you're the 10th?

734
01:03:49,237 --> 01:03:50,716
I'm guessing I'm the first

735
01:03:51,677 --> 01:03:53,554
to see through that
babe-in-the-woods act.

736
01:03:54,957 --> 01:03:56,549
You don't know me,

737
01:03:56,717 --> 01:03:58,309
but I've known a few women like you.

738
01:04:01,917 --> 01:04:04,227
I don't think you've ever
known a woman like me.

739
01:04:06,398 --> 01:04:08,912
You know, it's true what
they say about little boys.

740
01:04:09,558 --> 01:04:12,277
Born with no natural
inclination to share.

741
01:04:13,478 --> 01:04:16,595
I didn't steal your drive. I borrowed it.

742
01:04:17,918 --> 01:04:20,830
You'll find it in the glove
compartment of your car.

743
01:04:22,118 --> 01:04:23,233
Mr. Wayne.

744
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:17,715
Did you get it?

745
01:06:17,881 --> 01:06:18,881
The rock?

746
01:06:19,041 --> 01:06:20,269
Yeah, we got it.

747
01:06:46,081 --> 01:06:47,355
I'm sorry.

748
01:06:49,041 --> 01:06:51,953
Get down! Get down now!

749
01:07:07,802 --> 01:07:08,917
No!

750
01:09:03,084 --> 01:09:04,517
She was my world.

751
01:09:06,364 --> 01:09:08,195
And you took her from me.

752
01:09:19,005 --> 01:09:20,597
<i>Bruce!</i>

753
01:09:20,845 --> 01:09:23,643
Bruce! Listen to me now!

754
01:09:27,205 --> 01:09:28,399
It's Lois!

755
01:09:29,285 --> 01:09:30,559
It's Lois Lane!

756
01:09:31,885 --> 01:09:33,113
<i>She's the key!</i>

757
01:09:35,205 --> 01:09:36,604
Am I too soon?

758
01:09:39,165 --> 01:09:40,598
I'm too soon!

759
01:09:41,845 --> 01:09:43,836
<i>You're right about him!</i>

760
01:09:44,005 --> 01:09:46,917
<i>You've always been right about him!</i>

761
01:09:47,085 --> 01:09:49,440
Fear him! Fear him!

762
01:09:49,925 --> 01:09:51,199
Find us, Bruce!

763
01:09:52,325 --> 01:09:53,883
<i>You have to find us!</i>

764
01:10:58,207 --> 01:11:00,004
<i>The</i> White Portuguese <i>is not a man.</i>

765
01:11:00,167 --> 01:11:01,316
<i>It's a ship.</i>

766
01:11:04,087 --> 01:11:07,159
Master Wayne, since the age of seven

767
01:11:07,327 --> 01:11:09,204
you have been to the art of deception

768
01:11:09,367 --> 01:11:11,835
as Mozart to the harpsichord.

769
01:11:12,007 --> 01:11:15,044
But you've never been
too hot at lying to me.

770
01:11:17,687 --> 01:11:20,679
The <i>White Portuguese</i> is not
carrying a dirty bomb.

771
01:11:20,847 --> 01:11:22,246
<i>What is it carrying?</i>

772
01:11:23,527 --> 01:11:24,801
It's a weapon.

773
01:11:25,527 --> 01:11:27,199
It's a rock.

774
01:11:27,367 --> 01:11:30,644
A mineral capable of weakening
Kryptonian cells.

775
01:11:30,808 --> 01:11:32,568
<i>The first sample big enough
to mean something</i>

776
01:11:32,728 --> 01:11:34,764
turned up in the Indian Ocean
three months ago.

777
01:11:34,968 --> 01:11:36,560
It is now aboard the <i>White Portuguese</i>

778
01:11:36,768 --> 01:11:39,043
being delivered to Lex Luthor.

779
01:11:39,288 --> 01:11:40,801
Who I am going to steal it from.

780
01:11:41,048 --> 01:11:42,845
To keep it out of Luthor's hands.

781
01:11:43,088 --> 01:11:44,407
To destroy it.

782
01:11:45,888 --> 01:11:47,037
No.

783
01:11:49,808 --> 01:11:51,685
You're gonna go to war?

784
01:11:52,208 --> 01:11:56,565
That son of a bitch brought
the war to us two years ago.

785
01:11:58,088 --> 01:12:01,444
Jesus, Alfred. Count the dead.
Thousands of people.

786
01:12:03,008 --> 01:12:05,568
What's next? Millions?

787
01:12:05,768 --> 01:12:08,407
He has the power to wipe out
the entire human race,

788
01:12:08,568 --> 01:12:11,128
and if we believe there's even
a 1 % chance that he is our enemy,

789
01:12:11,208 --> 01:12:13,358
we have to take it
as an absolute certainty.

790
01:12:14,289 --> 01:12:15,722
And we have to destroy him.

791
01:12:15,929 --> 01:12:18,159
But he is not our enemy.

792
01:12:19,089 --> 01:12:20,602
Not today.

793
01:12:21,249 --> 01:12:23,046
20 years in Gotham, Alfred.

794
01:12:23,809 --> 01:12:25,720
We've seen what promises are worth.

795
01:12:26,929 --> 01:12:28,521
How many good guys are left.

796
01:12:29,969 --> 01:12:31,607
How many stayed that way.

797
01:12:34,649 --> 01:12:36,082
14 hours.

798
01:12:38,809 --> 01:12:41,277
My name is Clark Kent.
I'm from the <i>Daily Planet.</i>

799
01:12:44,889 --> 01:12:47,608
I'm trying to find out
what happened to an inmate,

800
01:12:47,809 --> 01:12:48,878
a Santos.

801
01:12:49,249 --> 01:12:50,887
I can't give out that information.

802
01:13:08,530 --> 01:13:09,804
Mommy!

803
01:13:13,450 --> 01:13:14,644
Mrs. Santos?

804
01:13:16,290 --> 01:13:18,008
<i>May I ask you a few questions?</i>

805
01:13:18,530 --> 01:13:21,806
He wasn't my husband.
But I know what he did.

806
01:13:23,130 --> 01:13:25,928
But he was a father. He was that, too.

807
01:13:26,970 --> 01:13:28,767
They took him out of Gotham Central.

808
01:13:28,930 --> 01:13:30,488
They moved him to Metropolis.

809
01:13:30,970 --> 01:13:32,642
But inside they know.

810
01:13:32,850 --> 01:13:35,205
They know the mark all over.
Guards don't care.

811
01:13:35,410 --> 01:13:36,729
Bat's the judge.

812
01:13:37,690 --> 01:13:39,521
One man decides who lives.

813
01:13:39,690 --> 01:13:41,248
- How is that justice?
- Talk to me.

814
01:13:41,930 --> 01:13:44,206
- Help me change it.
- With what? Your pen?

815
01:13:45,131 --> 01:13:47,326
A man like that, words don't stop him.

816
01:13:47,931 --> 01:13:50,764
You know stops him? A fist.

817
01:13:55,451 --> 01:13:56,811
<i>Kent, I want to talk to you.</i>

818
01:13:59,051 --> 01:14:00,530
Kent!

819
01:14:00,691 --> 01:14:02,682
Where does he go?
Where does he go, Jenny?

820
01:14:02,891 --> 01:14:04,370
I don't... I don't know.

821
01:14:04,771 --> 01:14:07,763
Clicks his heels three times,
goes back to Kansas, I suppose.

822
01:14:09,571 --> 01:14:10,765
Son of a...

823
01:14:23,251 --> 01:14:25,401
<i>Turn it! Turn it!</i>

824
01:15:09,092 --> 01:15:10,491
Move out!

825
01:15:46,573 --> 01:15:47,573
Go, go, go, go!

826
01:16:26,814 --> 01:16:28,008
No!

827
01:17:52,936 --> 01:17:54,164
Where is he?

828
01:19:14,098 --> 01:19:16,612
Next time they shine
your light in the sky,

829
01:19:16,818 --> 01:19:18,456
don't go to it.

830
01:19:18,618 --> 01:19:20,973
The Bat is dead. Bury it.

831
01:19:22,618 --> 01:19:23,892
Consider this mercy.

832
01:19:26,298 --> 01:19:27,447
<i>Tell me.</i>

833
01:19:31,898 --> 01:19:33,331
<i>Do you bleed?</i>

834
01:19:42,059 --> 01:19:43,378
<i>You will.</i>

835
01:21:25,621 --> 01:21:28,499
I don't have a halo over me,
Mr. Secretary.

836
01:21:28,701 --> 01:21:30,339
I went into the desert, people died.

837
01:21:30,621 --> 01:21:32,293
It keeps me awake. It should.

838
01:21:38,341 --> 01:21:39,981
If you think that Superman is a murderer,

839
01:21:40,181 --> 01:21:41,660
then throw it away.

840
01:21:42,181 --> 01:21:43,933
But I don't believe you think that.

841
01:21:47,021 --> 01:21:48,818
<i>How do we determine what's good?</i>

842
01:21:50,221 --> 01:21:53,054
In a democracy, good is a conversation,

843
01:21:53,221 --> 01:21:55,141
<i>not a unilateral decision.</i>

844
01:21:55,542 --> 01:21:58,614
So I urge Superman to come

845
01:21:58,782 --> 01:22:00,340
<i>to this Hill of the People tomorrow</i>

846
01:22:00,502 --> 01:22:02,140
<i>to see those who have suffered.</i>

847
01:22:02,902 --> 01:22:05,655
<i>The world needs to know
what happened in that desert.</i>

848
01:22:06,342 --> 01:22:07,855
<i>And to know what he stands for.</i>

849
01:22:08,862 --> 01:22:11,012
<i>How far will he take his power?</i>

850
01:22:12,662 --> 01:22:16,371
<i>Does he act by our will or by his own?</i>

851
01:22:24,262 --> 01:22:27,095
<i>People hate
what they don't understand.</i>

852
01:22:28,742 --> 01:22:32,371
But they see what you do,
and they know who you are.

853
01:22:33,862 --> 01:22:37,013
You're not a killer, a threat.

854
01:22:38,702 --> 01:22:40,694
I never wanted this world to have you.

855
01:22:44,343 --> 01:22:47,858
Be their hero, Clark. Be their monument.

856
01:22:48,023 --> 01:22:51,652
Be their angel.
Be anything they need you to be.

857
01:22:52,543 --> 01:22:54,215
Or be none of it.

858
01:22:55,983 --> 01:22:57,939
You don't owe this world a thing.

859
01:22:59,263 --> 01:23:00,901
You never did.

860
01:23:03,743 --> 01:23:06,541
<i>This is DeNiros.
Transfer available to Kane Avenue.</i>

861
01:23:06,703 --> 01:23:08,056
<i>Please, mind your step.</i>

862
01:23:38,104 --> 01:23:40,174
<i>I have to speak to the senator today.</i>

863
01:23:40,424 --> 01:23:41,840
<i>You cannot see the senator today.</i>

864
01:23:41,864 --> 01:23:43,480
<i>I need to speak to her
before the hearing.</i>

865
01:23:43,504 --> 01:23:45,104
<i>Do you understand how important this is?</i>

866
01:23:45,304 --> 01:23:46,840
<i>I cannot let you see the senator.</i>

867
01:23:46,864 --> 01:23:48,456
<i>Please, I need to speak to her.</i>

868
01:23:48,664 --> 01:23:51,462
<i>Please, madam. I beg of you!
Please don't do this!</i>

869
01:23:51,624 --> 01:23:52,898
<i>This is so important!</i>

870
01:23:53,104 --> 01:23:54,784
<i>- Come with me.
- Don't touch me!</i>

871
01:23:55,664 --> 01:23:57,541
- Please!
- I'm sorry. She wouldn't leave.

872
01:23:59,584 --> 01:24:01,097
I didn't tell you the truth.

873
01:24:02,424 --> 01:24:04,415
C.I. thinks the desert was a setup.

874
01:24:05,224 --> 01:24:07,021
Somebody wanted Superman to look guilty.

875
01:24:08,544 --> 01:24:10,536
The bullet?

876
01:24:18,185 --> 01:24:20,221
The metal was developed
by a private company.

877
01:24:20,385 --> 01:24:21,500
What company?

878
01:24:21,665 --> 01:24:22,780
LexCorp.

879
01:24:24,225 --> 01:24:25,294
Lex Luthor?

880
01:24:25,505 --> 01:24:28,417
He also had private security contractors
at the desert compound.

881
01:24:32,745 --> 01:24:34,064
Go on record.

882
01:24:34,545 --> 01:24:37,139
Not a chance. It's classified.

883
01:24:37,945 --> 01:24:39,219
I happen to like my job.

884
01:24:39,385 --> 01:24:40,454
It doesn't make sense.

885
01:24:40,625 --> 01:24:42,641
You said that the ambush was
arranged to frame Superman,

886
01:24:42,665 --> 01:24:45,418
but how could they know
that he'd show up in the...

887
01:24:52,025 --> 01:24:53,902
In the middle of the desert. Thank you.

888
01:24:57,386 --> 01:25:00,901
The Senate hearing is expected
to get underway any minute now.

889
01:25:01,106 --> 01:25:03,222
And of course the big
unknown in all of this is

890
01:25:03,426 --> 01:25:04,541
will Superman show up?

891
01:25:04,706 --> 01:25:05,842
That is what they're really
waiting to see.

892
01:25:05,866 --> 01:25:06,981
Mr. Keefe. Mr. Keefe.

893
01:25:07,146 --> 01:25:08,545
Soledad O'Brien, <i>In the Moment.</i>

894
01:25:08,746 --> 01:25:09,815
Quick question for you.

895
01:25:09,986 --> 01:25:11,642
You're heading in
to meet with the senators.

896
01:25:11,666 --> 01:25:12,894
What will you tell them?

897
01:25:13,426 --> 01:25:16,384
<i>I've come here
to tell them to wake up.</i>

898
01:25:16,546 --> 01:25:18,298
<i>This is flesh and blood.</i>

899
01:25:18,546 --> 01:25:19,979
<i>He has delivered a war here.</i>

900
01:25:20,186 --> 01:25:21,186
<i>And this...</i>

901
01:25:22,266 --> 01:25:24,860
<i>This is what war looks like.
I have nothing.</i>

902
01:25:25,106 --> 01:25:27,825
<i>There are plenty of people,
sir, who would say he's their hero.</i>

903
01:25:28,106 --> 01:25:29,744
<i>He is not a hero.</i>

904
01:25:29,946 --> 01:25:32,540
Grace, can you get Greg up here, please?

905
01:25:32,826 --> 01:25:33,975
Right now.

906
01:25:35,186 --> 01:25:36,826
An anonymous source can verify everything

907
01:25:37,066 --> 01:25:38,863
I told you about what
happened in Nairomi.

908
01:25:39,027 --> 01:25:41,382
- An anonymous source?
- Run it.

909
01:25:41,587 --> 01:25:43,259
Luthor engineered the desert.

910
01:25:43,587 --> 01:25:45,737
It was an ambush for Superman.

911
01:25:45,907 --> 01:25:47,243
Trust your reporter. Think Watergate.

912
01:25:47,267 --> 01:25:48,905
<i>Yeah, and you need to think litigate.</i>

913
01:25:49,107 --> 01:25:51,467
<i>If you're wrong, Luthor will
sue the paper out of existence.</i>

914
01:25:51,987 --> 01:25:53,056
<i>You need proof.</i>

915
01:25:53,387 --> 01:25:54,661
No. It needs to run now.

916
01:25:54,827 --> 01:25:55,827
<i>Before the hearing.</i>

917
01:25:55,987 --> 01:25:57,843
<i>If Superman knows,
it might change what he says.</i>

918
01:25:57,867 --> 01:25:59,903
I am not going to risk the paper

919
01:26:00,067 --> 01:26:01,580
so that you can pass notes in class

920
01:26:01,787 --> 01:26:02,981
to the man that rescued you.

921
01:26:03,347 --> 01:26:04,541
<i>He paid her?</i>

922
01:26:04,707 --> 01:26:07,426
Not only paid her.
He threatened her.

923
01:26:07,587 --> 01:26:08,940
Gave her a script to learn.

924
01:26:09,747 --> 01:26:11,624
Her parents are alive back home.

925
01:26:12,587 --> 01:26:14,384
But the girl's got a conscience.

926
01:26:14,547 --> 01:26:16,403
He's been using the committee
as his puppet theater.

927
01:26:16,427 --> 01:26:17,427
Senator!

928
01:26:18,107 --> 01:26:19,301
Hi, you.

929
01:26:19,467 --> 01:26:21,107
Don't go anywhere. I want to talk to you.

930
01:26:21,227 --> 01:26:22,227
Uh, you know what?

931
01:26:22,387 --> 01:26:24,743
Mercy, you go in and make sure
no one takes my seat.

932
01:26:24,908 --> 01:26:26,023
So what you been up to?

933
01:26:26,268 --> 01:26:27,508
I'm just here to tell my story.

934
01:26:27,668 --> 01:26:29,748
That I was willing to finance
a Kryptonian deterrent,

935
01:26:29,788 --> 01:26:31,468
but a certain junior senator from Kentucky

936
01:26:31,628 --> 01:26:32,822
decided to block it.

937
01:26:33,068 --> 01:26:37,266
Yes, the chair of the committee
on Superman is soft on security.

938
01:26:37,428 --> 01:26:38,924
Greg, why hasn't he been
getting our checks?

939
01:26:38,948 --> 01:26:40,063
He is, Mr. Wayne.

940
01:26:40,268 --> 01:26:42,228
He gets a check from
the Victims Fund every month.

941
01:26:42,428 --> 01:26:43,543
He returns them.

942
01:26:44,988 --> 01:26:46,580
<i>...who lost both his legs</i>

943
01:26:46,748 --> 01:26:48,864
<i>in those horrific events in Metropolis</i>

944
01:26:49,068 --> 01:26:50,296
<i>that happened two years ago.</i>

945
01:26:50,748 --> 01:26:51,897
Jesus.

946
01:26:53,868 --> 01:26:55,221
Why haven't I seen this?

947
01:26:55,388 --> 01:26:57,188
<i>I'm sorry.
I'll get to the bottom of it.</i>

948
01:26:57,828 --> 01:27:00,137
<i>And there he is. Superman is here.</i>

949
01:27:00,428 --> 01:27:02,384
<i>He is actually
at the United States Capitol.</i>

950
01:27:02,668 --> 01:27:04,818
<i>This is really a historic moment.</i>

951
01:27:04,988 --> 01:27:06,899
<i>Now we expect that Superman will give</i>

952
01:27:07,148 --> 01:27:08,980
<i>some kind of a statement to the Senate,</i>

953
01:27:09,229 --> 01:27:11,868
<i>to the American people,
and, of course, to the world.</i>

954
01:27:12,669 --> 01:27:13,818
He's here. He came.

955
01:27:13,989 --> 01:27:15,707
- He's above the Capitol.
- Ah.

956
01:27:16,709 --> 01:27:19,269
You are gonna be on the
hot seat in there, Junebug.

957
01:27:19,509 --> 01:27:22,740
I grew up on a farm.
I know how to wrestle a pig.

958
01:27:22,909 --> 01:27:24,749
Do you know the oldest lie
in America, Senator?

959
01:27:26,789 --> 01:27:28,541
It's that power can be innocent.

960
01:27:30,749 --> 01:27:31,864
Good luck.

961
01:28:07,870 --> 01:28:09,747
Oh, miss...

962
01:28:09,910 --> 01:28:11,502
Rudy, she's good to go.

963
01:28:20,270 --> 01:28:21,305
Get out!

964
01:28:24,870 --> 01:28:27,384
- Get out! Get out!
- Superman! Superman!

965
01:28:34,590 --> 01:28:36,430
Another one came
this morning, Mr. Wayne.

966
01:29:15,191 --> 01:29:18,228
Let me say at the outset
that I'm grateful to our witness

967
01:29:18,471 --> 01:29:19,790
for coming before us today.

968
01:29:21,551 --> 01:29:23,622
This is how a democracy works.

969
01:29:24,312 --> 01:29:25,711
We talk to each other.

970
01:29:27,072 --> 01:29:30,781
We act by the consent
of the governed, sir.

971
01:29:32,632 --> 01:29:35,988
<i>I have sat here before
to say that shadow interventions</i>

972
01:29:36,152 --> 01:29:37,752
<i>will not be tolerated by this committee.</i>

973
01:29:38,912 --> 01:29:39,947
<i>Neither will lies.</i>

974
01:29:42,072 --> 01:29:45,462
Because today is a day for truth.

975
01:29:47,352 --> 01:29:48,990
Because only by speaking...

976
01:29:59,592 --> 01:30:03,665
Only by working together can we...

977
01:30:09,833 --> 01:30:10,982
Can we...

978
01:30:21,033 --> 01:30:24,343
Can we create a free, and a...

979
01:30:53,554 --> 01:30:54,554
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

980
01:31:19,274 --> 01:31:21,310
<i>We're back
at the nation's Capitol,</i>

981
01:31:21,554 --> 01:31:22,953
<i>where something is happening.</i>

982
01:31:41,275 --> 01:31:42,275
<i>Excuse me.</i>

983
01:31:42,955 --> 01:31:44,468
Excuse me, officer.

984
01:31:45,515 --> 01:31:47,949
Member of the press.
Can you let me in, please?

985
01:31:55,955 --> 01:31:57,435
Breathe slowly and deeply.

986
01:31:58,035 --> 01:31:59,150
You're gonna be fine.

987
01:32:06,835 --> 01:32:10,271
Thank you.
I'm gonna need a little room to work.

988
01:32:11,675 --> 01:32:14,394
<i>Ma'am, it appears you've
suffered a head injury.</i>

989
01:32:15,315 --> 01:32:17,395
I'm gonna need you
to follow my light with your eyes.

990
01:33:08,077 --> 01:33:09,510
<i>Master Wayne.</i>

991
01:33:12,677 --> 01:33:14,429
Mr. Wayne!

992
01:33:15,557 --> 01:33:19,675
<i>...in the Senate hearing room
where Superman was testifying.</i>

993
01:33:19,837 --> 01:33:22,556
<i>This is a catastrophic
situation at our nation's Capitol.</i>

994
01:33:22,717 --> 01:33:24,037
<i>We don't have exact numbers yet,</i>

995
01:33:24,157 --> 01:33:26,273
<i>but I can tell you that
more than a dozen people</i>

996
01:33:26,477 --> 01:33:27,910
<i>have died in this explosion.</i>

997
01:33:28,077 --> 01:33:29,293
<i>First responders are at the scene.</i>

998
01:33:29,317 --> 01:33:31,114
<i>They are still bringing victims out.</i>

999
01:33:31,357 --> 01:33:35,635
<i>Now initially, Superman was helping
bring victims out after the blast,</i>

1000
01:33:35,797 --> 01:33:38,106
<i>but he seems to have disappeared...</i>

1001
01:33:38,317 --> 01:33:39,573
<i>...raising questions.</i>

1002
01:33:39,597 --> 01:33:42,395
<i>Carrie Birmingham,
reporting live from the nation's capital.</i>

1003
01:33:42,557 --> 01:33:45,357
<i>Capitol police are now
confirming that the blast was caused</i>

1004
01:33:45,397 --> 01:33:48,070
<i>by an explosive device
inside the hearing room.</i>

1005

<i>Run that one more time for me.</i>

1006
01:34:15,558 --> 01:34:18,436
- Can you enhance that?
- There you go, sir.

1007
01:34:57,119 --> 01:34:59,553
<i>Capitol police are confirming to CNN</i>

1008
01:34:59,759 --> 01:35:01,112

<i>Wallace Vernon Keefe. Now these sources...</i>

1010
01:35:03,479 --> 01:35:05,151
Clark, it's me again. Can you...

1011
01:35:05,319 --> 01:35:07,639
<i>...could have gotten
the explosive device into the hearing</i>

1012
01:35:07,719 --> 01:35:09,914
<i>by concealing them inside his wheelchair.</i>

1013
01:35:10,119 --> 01:35:13,316
<i>As for Superman, he was in the room,
but obviously failed to stop him.</i>

1014
01:35:13,479 --> 01:35:14,753
I didn't see it, Lo.

1015
01:35:15,999 --> 01:35:17,910
I was standing right there
and I didn't see it.

1016
01:35:18,079 --> 01:35:19,519
Clark, there are people behind this.

1017
01:35:19,639 --> 01:35:22,552
I'm afraid I didn't see it
because I wasn't looking.

1018
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:26,634
All this time,

1019
01:35:27,480 --> 01:35:29,994
I've been living my life
the way my father saw it.

1020
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:33,316
Righting wrongs for a ghost.

1021
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:37,875
Thinking I'm here to do good.

1022
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:43,671
Superman was never real.

1023
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:46,995
Just the dream of a farmer from Kansas.

1024
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:51,472
That farmer's dream
is all some people have.

1025
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:54,355
It's all that gives them hope.

1026
01:36:05,201 --> 01:36:07,032
This means something.

1027
01:36:08,201 --> 01:36:10,032
It did on my world.

1028
01:36:11,361 --> 01:36:13,670
My world doesn't exist anymore.

1029

Yes, I would.

01:37:44,563 --> 01:37:46,474
Yes, I would.

<i>Analyzing.</i>

01:41:10,647 --> 01:41:12,922
You flew too close to the sun.

1045
01:41:15,287 --> 01:41:17,039
Now look at you.

1052
01:41:35,608 --> 01:41:36,723
<i>Destroyed, sir.</i>

1053
01:41:38,008 --> 01:41:39,361
Then proceed.

1054
01:41:39,848 --> 01:41:41,167
<i>Very well.</i>

<i>"His disappearance

No.

01:41:59,728 --> 01:42:01,904
<i>There are still so many

1063
01:42:01,928 --> 01:42:02,998
<i>Chief among them,</i>

<i>whether Superman was involved

<i>I mean, here's an individual

1071
01:42:45,169 --> 01:42:46,238
Same for me.

1072
01:42:57,130 --> 01:43:00,167
<i>Now one FBI official
familiar with this case</i>

1073
01:43:00,330 --> 01:43:01,922

<i>"A jackpot of bomb-making materials
inside Keefe's apartment."</i>

1075
01:43:05,970 --> 01:43:07,449
<i>What they need to determine now is</i>

1076
01:43:07,650 --> 01:43:10,847
<i>whether he had any help in the planning
and execution of the bombing.</i>

1077
01:43:11,010 --> 01:43:15,401
<i>And they haven't ruled out the idea
that Superman was a co-conspirator.</i>

1078
01:43:16,330 --> 01:43:17,558
<i>Now, my sources are telling me</i>

1079
01:43:17,730 --> 01:43:20,767
<i>they are getting a barrage of anonymous

<i>with all roads in this investigation

1081
01:44:02,971 --> 01:44:05,201
All right, Lois. You gotta go.

1082
01:44:22,092 --> 01:44:24,128
He didn't know he was gonna die.

1083
01:44:25,412 --> 01:44:27,050
He just bought groceries.

1084
01:44:27,212 --> 01:44:29,009
The wheelchair and
the bullet from the desert

1085
01:44:29,172 --> 01:44:31,049
were made from the same metal.

1086
01:44:31,212 --> 01:44:32,492
I know. The desert. The hearing.

1087
01:44:32,532 --> 01:44:35,205
Everywhere Superman goes,
Luthor wants death.

1088
01:44:35,372 --> 01:44:37,840
<i>But, Luthor goes
through all of that trouble...</i>

1089
01:44:38,012 --> 01:44:41,209
Creates a bomb out of a wheelchair,
and then alters it to reduce the blast?

1090
01:44:41,412 --> 01:44:43,004
What do you mean?

1091
01:44:43,172 --> 01:44:45,732
The inside of the chair
was lined with lead.

1092
01:44:47,932 --> 01:44:49,411
You couldn't stop it.

1093
01:44:49,852 --> 01:44:52,047
You couldn't see it.

1094
01:45:34,413 --> 01:45:35,732
Something, isn't it?

1095
01:45:37,613 --> 01:45:41,606
We men of Kansas live on a pancake,
so we come to the mountains.

1096
01:45:42,733 --> 01:45:46,363
All downhill from here,
down to the floodplain.

1097
01:45:46,534 --> 01:45:48,570
Farm at the bottom of the world.

1098
01:45:50,374 --> 01:45:53,252
I remember one season the water came bad.

1099
01:45:53,414 --> 01:45:55,450
I couldn't have been 12.

1100
01:45:55,654 --> 01:45:58,532
Dad had out the shovels
and we went at it all night.

1101
01:45:58,694 --> 01:46:00,470
We worked till, I think, I fainted.

1102
01:46:00,494 --> 01:46:02,246
But we managed to stop the water.

1103
01:46:03,574 --> 01:46:05,212
We saved the farm.

1104
01:46:06,614 --> 01:46:09,686
Your grandma baked me a cake.
Said I was a hero.

1105
01:46:12,214 --> 01:46:16,173
Later that day we found out
we blocked the water all right.

1106
01:46:16,374 --> 01:46:17,693
We sent it upstream.

1107
01:46:18,894 --> 01:46:21,089
The whole Lang farm washed away.

1108
01:46:22,454 --> 01:46:25,332
<i>While I ate my hero cake,
their horses were drowning.</i>

1109
01:46:28,294 --> 01:46:31,014
I used to hear them wailing in my sleep.

1110
01:46:34,455 --> 01:46:36,571
Did the nightmares ever stop?

1111
01:46:38,695 --> 01:46:40,014
Yeah.

1112
01:46:41,055 --> 01:46:42,966
When I met your mother.

1113
01:46:45,015 --> 01:46:47,813
She gave me faith that
there's good in this world.

1114
01:46:50,295 --> 01:46:52,570
<i>She was my world.</i>

1115
01:46:55,255 --> 01:46:56,847
I miss you, son.

1116
01:47:01,775 --> 01:47:03,766
I miss you too, Dad.

1117
01:47:23,616 --> 01:47:25,208
You know you can't win this.

1118
01:47:26,936 --> 01:47:28,528
It's suicide.

1119
01:47:31,336 --> 01:47:34,692
I'm older now than my father ever was.

1120
01:47:36,696 --> 01:47:39,608
This may be the only thing
I do that matters.

1121
01:47:40,376 --> 01:47:44,255
20 years of fighting criminals
amounts to nothing?

1122
01:47:44,416 --> 01:47:46,976
Criminals are like weeds, Alfred.

1123
01:47:47,136 --> 01:47:49,889
Pull one up, another grows in its place.

1124
01:47:51,576 --> 01:47:54,249
This is about the future of the world.

1125
01:47:55,456 --> 01:47:57,048
This is my legacy.

1126
01:47:58,656 --> 01:48:00,648
My father sat me down right here.

1127
01:48:00,817 --> 01:48:02,569
Told me what Wayne Manor was built on.

1128
01:48:02,737 --> 01:48:06,366
Railroads, real estates, and oil.

1129
01:48:06,537 --> 01:48:10,007
The first generation made their fortune
trading with the French.

1130
01:48:10,177 --> 01:48:11,769
Pelts and skins.

1131
01:48:15,697 --> 01:48:17,369
They were hunters.

1132
01:48:33,817 --> 01:48:36,536
So falls the house of Wayne.

1133
01:48:37,577 --> 01:48:41,126
<i>We gotta wait for more
evidence, but the question still remains,</i>

1134
01:48:41,297 --> 01:48:42,412
<i>where is he?</i>

1135
01:48:43,217 --> 01:48:45,368
<i>If Superman was not involved,</i>

1136
01:48:45,578 --> 01:48:46,852
<i>if he's got nothing to hide,</i>

1137
01:48:47,058 --> 01:48:50,653
<i>then why hasn't he been seen
since the day of this tragedy?</i>

1138
01:48:50,818 --> 01:48:52,474
<i>You can't point a finger and...</i>

1139
01:48:52,498 --> 01:48:54,779
<i>I'm not pointing anything, Warren.
Look. Ten fingers, see?</i>

1140
01:48:54,818 --> 01:48:56,649
<i>If there is going to be a criminal...</i>

1141
01:50:25,260 --> 01:50:26,932
The night is here.

1142
01:50:57,700 --> 01:50:58,894
Excuse me.

1143
01:51:00,941 --> 01:51:02,090
Don't I know...

1144
01:52:05,302 --> 01:52:09,056
Plain Lo in the morning. Lola in slacks.

1145
01:52:10,382 --> 01:52:11,576
Lois Lane.

1146
01:52:14,022 --> 01:52:15,535
Mmm. Come see the view.

1147
01:52:15,982 --> 01:52:17,779
Um... Mmm-mmm.

1148
01:52:18,062 --> 01:52:22,419
Now the secret to the height
is the building material.

1149
01:52:22,582 --> 01:52:26,370
It's light metals
which sway a bit in the wind.

1150
01:52:27,382 --> 01:52:28,383
Hmm.

1151
01:52:30,743 --> 01:52:32,399
And you know something
about LexCorp metals,

1152
01:52:32,423 --> 01:52:33,822
don't you, Miss Lane?

1153
01:52:34,023 --> 01:52:36,218
I've proven what you've done.

1154
01:52:36,383 --> 01:52:37,896
Wow, you're feisty.

1155
01:52:38,063 --> 01:52:40,372
Unfortunately, that will blow away.

1156
01:52:40,543 --> 01:52:42,056
Like sand in the desert.

1157
01:52:42,223 --> 01:52:43,895
You're psychotic.

1158
01:52:44,063 --> 01:52:47,533
That is a three-syllable word
for any thought too big for little minds.

1159
01:52:48,063 --> 01:52:50,054
Hmm. Next category: circles.

1160
01:52:50,583 --> 01:52:55,532
Round and round
and round they go to find Superman.

1161
01:52:55,703 --> 01:52:57,479
Wrong category, boy.
No, no, triangles.

1162
01:52:57,503 --> 01:52:58,902
Yes, Euclid's triangle inequality.

1163
01:52:59,063 --> 01:53:01,054
The shortest distance
between any two points

1164
01:53:01,223 --> 01:53:02,895
is a straight path.

1165
01:53:03,063 --> 01:53:05,861
And I believe
the straightest path to Superman

1166
01:53:06,023 --> 01:53:07,695
is a pretty little road...

1167
01:53:07,903 --> 01:53:09,859
Mmm. Called Lois Lane.

1168
01:53:32,424 --> 01:53:33,937
You came back.

1169
01:53:34,784 --> 01:53:36,263
You came back.

1170
01:53:55,384 --> 01:53:57,614
Boy, do we have problems up here!

1171
01:54:01,785 --> 01:54:04,379
The problem of... Of evil in the world.

1172
01:54:04,545 --> 01:54:06,376
Uh, the problem of absolute virtue.

1173
01:54:06,545 --> 01:54:08,740
I'll take you in without breaking you.

1174
01:54:08,945 --> 01:54:10,856
Which is more than you deserve.

1175
01:54:11,025 --> 01:54:12,981
The problem of you
on top of everything else.

1176
01:54:13,145 --> 01:54:14,294
You above all.

1177
01:54:15,105 --> 01:54:16,777
Ah, because that's what God is.

1178
01:54:17,385 --> 01:54:21,503
Horus. Apollo. Jehovah. Kal-El.

1179
01:54:22,705 --> 01:54:25,822
Clark Joseph Kent.

1180
01:54:27,505 --> 01:54:30,941
See, what we call God
depends upon our tribe, Clark-Joe.

1181
01:54:31,705 --> 01:54:34,663
Because God is tribal. God takes sides.

1182
01:54:34,825 --> 01:54:36,656
No man in the sky intervened
when I was a boy

1183
01:54:36,825 --> 01:54:39,544
to deliver me from
Daddy's fist and abominations. Mmm.

1184
01:54:39,945 --> 01:54:41,742
I figured out way back,

1185
01:54:42,025 --> 01:54:45,223
if God is all-powerful,
he cannot be all-good.

1186
01:54:46,866 --> 01:54:49,983
And if he is all-good,
then he cannot be all-powerful.

1187
01:54:50,746 --> 01:54:52,657
And neither can you be.

1188
01:54:53,026 --> 01:54:55,494
They need to see the fraud you are.

1189
01:54:56,186 --> 01:54:57,778
With their eyes.

1190
01:54:58,746 --> 01:55:01,101
The blood on your hands.

1191
01:55:01,266 --> 01:55:02,938
What have you done?

1192
01:55:03,106 --> 01:55:04,858
Hmm. And tonight, they will.

1193
01:55:05,026 --> 01:55:08,655
Yes. Because you, my friend,
have a date. Hmm.

1194
01:55:08,866 --> 01:55:10,538
Across the bay.

1195
01:55:10,706 --> 01:55:12,901
Ripe fruit, his hate. Two years growing.

1196
01:55:13,066 --> 01:55:14,962
But it did not take much
to push him over, actually.

1197
01:55:14,986 --> 01:55:16,704
Little red notes, big bang.

1198
01:55:16,866 --> 01:55:18,219
You let your family die!

1199
01:55:19,266 --> 01:55:25,182
<i>And now you will fly to him.
And you will battle him.</i>

1200
01:55:25,346 --> 01:55:26,495
To the death.

1201
01:55:27,747 --> 01:55:30,659
Black and blue. Fight Night!

1202
01:55:31,627 --> 01:55:34,505
The greatest gladiator match
in the history of the world.

1203
01:55:34,707 --> 01:55:36,982
God versus man.

1204
01:55:37,187 --> 01:55:39,098
Day versus night.

1205
01:55:39,907 --> 01:55:43,263
Son of Krypton versus Bat of Gotham.

1206
01:55:43,467 --> 01:55:45,537
You think I'll fight him for you?

1207
01:55:45,747 --> 01:55:46,782
Hmm, yes, I do.

1208
01:55:46,947 --> 01:55:49,708
I think you will fight-fight-fight
for that special lady in your life.

1209
01:55:50,147 --> 01:55:52,581
She's safe on the ground. How about you?

1210
01:55:52,747 --> 01:55:55,500
Close, but I am not talking about Lois.

1211
01:55:55,667 --> 01:55:56,702
No.

1212
01:55:56,867 --> 01:56:00,177
Every boy's special lady is his mother.

1213
01:56:06,147 --> 01:56:08,866
Martha, Martha, Martha.

1214
01:56:09,267 --> 01:56:10,267
Hmm.

1215
01:56:10,467 --> 01:56:13,824
Why, the mother of a flying demon
must be a witch.

1216
01:56:14,588 --> 01:56:17,102
The punishment for witches, what is that?

1217
01:56:17,428 --> 01:56:19,623
That's right. Death by fire.

1218
01:56:21,908 --> 01:56:23,227
Mmm.

1219
01:56:29,508 --> 01:56:31,419
Where is she?

1220
01:56:31,588 --> 01:56:33,268
I don't know!
I would not let them tell me!

1221
01:56:33,348 --> 01:56:35,657
Uh-uh-uh! If you kill me, Martha dies.

1222
01:56:35,828 --> 01:56:37,508
And if you fly away, mmm,
Martha also dies.

1223
01:56:37,668 --> 01:56:40,387
But if you kill the Bat...

1224
01:56:40,548 --> 01:56:42,186
Martha lives.

1225
01:56:47,028 --> 01:56:50,418
There we go. There we go. Hmm.

1226
01:56:52,868 --> 01:56:56,304
And now God bends to my will.

1227
01:57:02,749 --> 01:57:05,138
Ooh, now the cameras
are waiting at your ship.

1228
01:57:05,349 --> 01:57:07,499
For the world to see
the holes in the holy.

1229
01:57:07,669 --> 01:57:10,342
Yes, the Almighty comes clean
about how dirty he is when it counts.

1230
01:57:10,509 --> 01:57:11,703
To save Martha,

1231
01:57:12,189 --> 01:57:14,100
bring me the head of the Bat.

1232
01:57:17,349 --> 01:57:18,349
Ah.

1233
01:57:18,589 --> 01:57:21,387
Mother of God, would you look at the time?

1234
01:57:21,549 --> 01:57:23,824
When you came here, you had an hour.

1235
01:57:25,189 --> 01:57:27,020
Now it's less.

1236
01:58:29,391 --> 01:58:30,567
<i>Brooke Baldwin is on the scene.</i>

1237
01:58:30,591 --> 01:58:32,631
<i>Brooke, you're live on the air.
What are you seeing?</i>

1238
01:58:32,711 --> 01:58:34,311
There's something happening at the ship.

1239
01:58:35,671 --> 01:58:38,060
It's sending massive power surges.

1240
01:58:38,751 --> 01:58:40,487
<i>Police helicopters surrounding the area.</i>

1241
01:58:40,511 --> 01:58:42,866
<i>They've created a barricade
around this containment center.</i>

1242
01:58:43,031 --> 01:58:44,567
<i>And we're trying to get
a little bit closer here</i>

1243
01:58:44,591 --> 01:58:45,865
<i>to find out what's going on.</i>

1244
01:58:46,071 --> 01:58:47,265
<i>It is absolute chaos.</i>

1245
01:58:47,431 --> 01:58:50,070
<i>You can see that lightning,
those surges of electricity.</i>

1246
01:58:50,231 --> 01:58:52,950
<i>They seem to be getting
stronger by the minute.</i>

1247
01:58:53,111 --> 01:58:54,385
<i>Daily Planet.</i>

1248
01:58:55,991 --> 01:58:57,219
Lois.

1249
01:58:58,471 --> 01:59:00,431
I have to go to Gotham
to convince him to help me.

1250
01:59:00,591 --> 01:59:01,591
Who?

1251
01:59:03,791 --> 01:59:05,986
Or he has to die.

1252
01:59:06,151 --> 01:59:07,151
Clark.

1253
01:59:10,471 --> 01:59:12,781
No one stays good in this world.

1254
01:59:21,592 --> 01:59:25,426
<i>But as of right now, much of
the city remains in the dark tonight.</i>

1255
01:59:25,592 --> 01:59:26,592
<i>Much chaos.</i>

1256
01:59:26,832 --> 01:59:29,744
<i>Much confusing happening
on the streets of Metropolis tonight.</i>

1257
01:59:29,912 --> 01:59:31,728
<i>Those helicopters are still
surrounding the area.</i>

1258
01:59:31,752 --> 01:59:34,550
<i>I don't know if you can
still see those bolts of lightning...</i>

1259
02:01:36,435 --> 02:01:41,634
<i>2400 hours and 2 minutes.
Subject declining rapidly.</i>

1260
02:01:41,795 --> 02:01:43,706
<i>All procedural interventions have failed.</i>

1261
02:01:48,635 --> 02:01:50,835
<i>Outcome will be death.</i>

1262
02:01:58,595 --> 02:02:01,507
<i>Dr. Silas Stone
suspending all clinical protocol.</i>

1263
02:02:01,675 --> 02:02:08,114
<i>US Gov, object 6-19-82
is successfully activated.</i>

1264
02:02:29,556 --> 02:02:31,148
<i>I need a chopper to Gotham.</i>

1265
02:02:31,316 --> 02:02:32,316
Call the heliport.

1266
02:02:32,476 --> 02:02:34,273
Chopper? We can barely afford a bicycle.

1267
02:02:34,436 --> 02:02:36,313
You wanna chase a story? Go to the ship.

1268
02:02:36,476 --> 02:02:37,836
Superman's probably there already.

1269
02:02:37,996 --> 02:02:40,954
Perry, it's not for a story.

1270
02:02:45,676 --> 02:02:47,155
Jenny, get her a chopper to Gotham.

1271
02:02:47,356 --> 02:02:50,029
And forget the heliport.
Put it on the goddamn roof.

1272
02:02:50,236 --> 02:02:51,510
On the roof, Lois!

1273
02:02:54,116 --> 02:02:55,550
Where are we headed?

1274
02:02:55,717 --> 02:02:56,832
There!

1275
02:03:12,917 --> 02:03:15,875
<i>Well, here I am.</i>

1276
02:03:17,317 --> 02:03:18,830
Bruce. Please.

1277
02:03:20,477 --> 02:03:23,469
I was wrong. You have to listen to me.

1278
02:03:23,637 --> 02:03:24,911
Lex wants us to...

1279
02:03:39,918 --> 02:03:42,478
You don't understand.

1280
02:03:42,638 --> 02:03:44,151
There's no time!

1281
02:03:45,198 --> 02:03:46,551
<i>I understand.</i>

1282
02:05:02,959 --> 02:05:04,677
Stay down!

1283
02:05:04,839 --> 02:05:07,148
If I wanted it, you'd be dead already.

1284
02:05:44,680 --> 02:05:46,477
<i>Breathe it in.</i>

1285
02:05:49,440 --> 02:05:51,351
<i>That's fear.</i>

1286
02:05:53,681 --> 02:05:55,478
<i>You're not brave.</i>

1287
02:05:59,681 --> 02:06:01,319
<i>Men are brave.</i>

1288
02:09:50,926 --> 02:09:54,760
<i>I bet your parents taught you
that you mean something.</i>

1289
02:09:55,606 --> 02:09:57,437
<i>That you're here for a reason.</i>

1290
02:09:58,766 --> 02:10:01,803
<i>My parents taught me a different lesson,</i>

1291
02:10:02,926 --> 02:10:04,325
<i>dying in the gutter</i>

1292
02:10:04,966 --> 02:10:07,116
<i>for no reason at all.</i>

1293
02:10:23,687 --> 02:10:26,155
<i>They taught me the world only makes sense</i>

1294
02:10:26,367 --> 02:10:28,358
<i>if you force it to.</i>

1295
02:11:06,248 --> 02:11:08,045
<i>You were never a God.</i>

1296
02:11:11,768 --> 02:11:13,724
<i>You were never even a man.</i>

1297
02:11:20,528 --> 02:11:24,043
You're letting him kill Martha.

1298
02:11:29,368 --> 02:11:31,324
<i>What does that mean?</i>

1299
02:11:32,528 --> 02:11:34,246
<i>Why did you say that name?</i>

1300
02:11:35,368 --> 02:11:37,882
Find him.

1301
02:11:39,208 --> 02:11:40,561
Save

1302
02:11:40,888 --> 02:11:42,560
<i>Martha.</i>

1303
02:11:45,288 --> 02:11:46,880
<i>Martha.</i>

1304
02:12:17,769 --> 02:12:19,760
Martha.

1305
02:12:23,889 --> 02:12:25,163
<i>Why did you say that name?</i>

1306
02:12:26,929 --> 02:12:28,601
<i>Martha! Why did you say that name?</i>

1307
02:12:28,769 --> 02:12:30,248
Clark! Stop!

1308
02:12:30,449 --> 02:12:31,598
Please! Stop!

1309
02:12:31,769 --> 02:12:33,282
<i>Why did you say that name?</i>

1310
02:12:33,449 --> 02:12:35,007
It's his mother's name!

1311
02:12:35,610 --> 02:12:37,760
It's his mother's name.

1312
02:13:08,170 --> 02:13:10,570
<i>We're not getting any answers.</i>

1313
02:13:10,610 --> 02:13:12,506
We're still right outside
the containment center.

1314
02:13:12,530 --> 02:13:13,599
A dangerous situation.

1315
02:13:13,770 --> 02:13:17,001
Military and police personnel
surrounding the area.

1316
02:13:32,291 --> 02:13:33,644
<i>Luthor.</i>

1317
02:13:33,851 --> 02:13:35,967
He wanted your life for hers.

1318
02:13:37,171 --> 02:13:38,490
She's losing time.

1319
02:13:39,011 --> 02:13:41,479
The scout ship seems to be
drawing power from the city.

1320
02:13:41,691 --> 02:13:43,329
It's got to be Lex.

1321
02:13:43,491 --> 02:13:46,324
<i>They need you at that ship.
I'll find her.</i>

1322
02:13:46,531 --> 02:13:48,840
- My mother needs me.
- Wait.

1323
02:13:49,491 --> 02:13:51,686
<i>I'll make you a promise.</i>

1324
02:13:51,851 --> 02:13:54,046
<i>Martha won't die tonight.</i>

1325
02:14:20,892 --> 02:14:22,041
<i>Master Wayne.</i>

1326
02:14:22,212 --> 02:14:23,611
<i>Alfred.</i>

1327
02:14:23,772 --> 02:14:26,605
Uh, I'm sorry for listening in,
but I've tracked the Russian's phone

1328
02:14:26,772 --> 02:14:28,251
to a warehouse near the port.

1329
02:14:28,412 --> 02:14:29,845
<i>You're locked onto it.</i>

1330
02:14:30,012 --> 02:14:31,730
<i>I don't deserve you, Alfred.</i>

1331
02:14:31,892 --> 02:14:34,360
No, sir. You don't.

1332
02:14:54,173 --> 02:14:56,448
I'm afraid this is goodbye.

1333
02:14:58,573 --> 02:15:03,044
And every time we say goodbye,
you die a little.

1334
02:15:16,173 --> 02:15:17,811
- Take it down.
- Go! Go!

1335
02:15:41,454 --> 02:15:42,603
<i>You have to take it, Alfred.</i>

1336
02:15:43,134 --> 02:15:44,647
Ah, right.

1337
02:15:45,054 --> 02:15:47,170
Commencing drone mode.

1338
02:15:50,374 --> 02:15:54,652
Thermal imaging is showing me
two dozen hostiles on the third floor.

1339
02:15:54,814 --> 02:15:57,009
Why don't I drop you off on the second?

1340
02:19:02,938 --> 02:19:04,337
Drop it.

1341
02:19:05,378 --> 02:19:07,209
I said drop it!

1342
02:19:08,298 --> 02:19:09,697
I'll kill her.

1343
02:19:11,498 --> 02:19:13,853
Believe me, I'll do it.

1344
02:19:16,698 --> 02:19:17,847
<i>I believe you.</i>

1345
02:19:30,379 --> 02:19:32,609
<i>It's okay. I'm a friend of your son's.</i>

1346
02:19:33,059 --> 02:19:34,651
I figured.

1347
02:19:34,819 --> 02:19:36,218
The cape.

1348
02:20:04,020 --> 02:20:05,738
"Late, late," says the White Rabbit.

1349
02:20:05,900 --> 02:20:07,396
<i>Forty seconds to animation.</i>

1350
02:20:07,420 --> 02:20:08,899
Right, wabbit?

1351
02:20:09,340 --> 02:20:12,889
Hmm. Out of tricks, out of time.

1352
02:20:13,900 --> 02:20:16,539
And one Bat head short.

1353
02:20:16,700 --> 02:20:18,930
<i>Thirty seconds to animation.</i>

1354
02:20:19,140 --> 02:20:21,220
Ah. That'll be the cook. Excuse me.

1355
02:20:21,340 --> 02:20:23,490
Uh, Gotham Roast. Well done.

1356
02:20:24,100 --> 02:20:26,091
Hello. Break the bad news.

1357
02:20:26,260 --> 02:20:29,058
<i>I'd rather do
the breaking in person.</i>

1358
02:20:29,220 --> 02:20:30,916
<i>Twenty seconds to animation.</i>

1359
02:20:30,940 --> 02:20:32,612
You've lost.

1360
02:20:32,820 --> 02:20:34,333
I don't know how to lose.

1361
02:20:34,500 --> 02:20:35,933
You'll learn.

1362
02:20:36,100 --> 02:20:37,215
I'll learn.

1363
02:20:37,380 --> 02:20:38,972
I don't hate the sinner.

1364
02:20:39,500 --> 02:20:41,411
- I hate the sin.
<i>- 10 seconds to animation.</i>

1365
02:20:41,620 --> 02:20:44,214
And yours, my friend, is existing.

1366
02:20:45,020 --> 02:20:46,453
I cannot let you win.

1367
02:20:46,620 --> 02:20:49,237
I gave the Bat a fighting chance to do it,
but he was not strong enough.

1368
02:20:49,261 --> 02:20:51,172
So, if man won't kill God...

1369
02:20:51,381 --> 02:20:53,099
<i>...two, one.</i>

1370
02:20:54,901 --> 02:20:56,095
...the devil will do it!

1371
02:21:12,461 --> 02:21:13,496
Perry!

1372
02:21:13,821 --> 02:21:15,493
All right. Stay calm, everybody!

1373
02:21:16,381 --> 02:21:18,221
<i>We're getting reports
there are total blackouts</i>

1374
02:21:18,301 --> 02:21:21,179
<i>in the north and to
the northwest of the city.</i>

1375
02:21:21,341 --> 02:21:22,477
<i>Federal authorities
are trying to determine</i>

1376
02:21:22,501 --> 02:21:24,810
<i>if this is part of
a larger terrorist attack.</i>

1377
02:21:29,101 --> 02:21:31,979
Ancient Kryptonian deformity.

1378
02:21:32,502 --> 02:21:35,778
Hmm. Blood of my blood.

1379
02:21:42,742 --> 02:21:44,698
Born to destroy you.

1380
02:21:47,662 --> 02:21:48,811
Your Doomsday.

1381
02:22:12,542 --> 02:22:17,901
Now God is good as dead.

1382
02:22:20,823 --> 02:22:22,017
Oh!

1383
02:23:40,944 --> 02:23:42,218
POTUS joining.

1384
02:23:42,384 --> 02:23:43,384
Mr. President.

1385
02:23:43,544 --> 02:23:44,760
<i>What the hell is it, Calvin?</i>

1386
02:23:44,784 --> 02:23:46,465
<i>These are live images from the top</i>

1387
02:23:46,625 --> 02:23:49,662
<i>of the LexCorp tower
in downtown Metropolis.</i>

1388
02:23:49,825 --> 02:23:51,258
<i>Military aircraft are on the scene.</i>

1389
02:24:03,065 --> 02:24:04,817
- Are you hurt, ma'am?
- I'm okay.

1390
02:24:04,985 --> 02:24:06,657
Good. You're gonna be all right, okay?

1391
02:24:16,545 --> 02:24:19,821
<i>This thing emerged
from the Kryptonian crash site</i>

1392
02:24:19,985 --> 02:24:21,020
<i>just moments ago.</i>

1393
02:24:21,185 --> 02:24:24,222
<i>Thankfully though, the work day is over
in the downtown core.</i>

1394
02:24:24,425 --> 02:24:25,494
<i>It's nearly empty.</i>

1395
02:24:26,265 --> 02:24:29,302
<i>Now military aircraft.
Those are Apache helicopters.</i>

1396
02:24:29,505 --> 02:24:31,940
<i>They have now just arrived.
The images that...</i>

1397
02:25:08,226 --> 02:25:11,263
<i>We've, uh... We just lost
connection with Metropolis 8 News.</i>

1398
02:25:11,426 --> 02:25:13,860
<i>Now, it's not clear what just happened.</i>

1399
02:25:17,387 --> 02:25:19,105
<i>What's happening there, Alfred?</i>

1400
02:25:20,787 --> 02:25:22,903
How best to describe it?

1401
02:25:23,067 --> 02:25:24,443
<i>Metropolis airspace
has been closed briefly.</i>

1402
02:25:24,467 --> 02:25:25,587
Excuse me?

1403
02:25:25,627 --> 02:25:26,883
<i>We kindly ask that you stay in your seats.</i>

1404
02:25:26,907 --> 02:25:28,101
Excuse me?

1405
02:25:28,267 --> 02:25:29,666
Miss Prince?

1406
02:25:44,467 --> 02:25:46,298
Sir. Look, they've cleared the city.

1407
02:25:46,467 --> 02:25:47,723
Looks like he's taking it into space.

1408
02:25:47,747 --> 02:25:49,443
We can go
straight to Key Red, Mr. President.

1409
02:25:49,467 --> 02:25:51,423
Not yet. Are you crazy?

1410
02:25:51,587 --> 02:25:53,883
They're high enough that we can nuke 'em
with no casualties, sir.

1411
02:25:53,907 --> 02:25:57,297
One casualty, Mr. President. Superman.

1412
02:25:59,187 --> 02:26:00,940
<i>God have mercy on us all.</i>

1413
02:26:07,868 --> 02:26:09,267
- Key is hot.
- Key is hot.

1414
02:26:09,428 --> 02:26:11,828
Red birds are armed to deploy, sir.

1415
02:26:12,468 --> 02:26:13,617
<i>Fire at will.</i>

1416
02:26:13,788 --> 02:26:15,938
Three, two, one...

1417
02:27:04,829 --> 02:27:06,342
<i>Oh, God.</i>

1418
02:27:28,069 --> 02:27:29,867
Projectile 1. Impact.

1419
02:27:30,030 --> 02:27:31,941
Stryker's Island, east of Metropolis.

1420
02:27:32,110 --> 02:27:33,259
That's uninhabited.

1421
02:27:33,430 --> 02:27:34,783
Projectile 2...

1422
02:27:40,430 --> 02:27:41,749
No apparent reentry.

1423
02:27:42,470 --> 02:27:44,347
<i>Projectile 2?</i>

1424
02:27:44,550 --> 02:27:49,943
Superman, Mr. President.
Projectile 2 was Superman.

1425
02:27:50,550 --> 02:27:52,222
Sir.

1426
02:27:52,390 --> 02:27:53,539
It's moving.

1427
02:28:34,831 --> 02:28:36,662
<i>The shockwaves are getting stronger.</i>

1428
02:28:36,831 --> 02:28:39,903
Every time we hit it,
we make it more powerful.

1429
02:28:40,111 --> 02:28:41,226
We can't attack.

1430
02:28:42,351 --> 02:28:44,421
<i>What are you saying, Calvin?</i>

1431
02:28:44,591 --> 02:28:46,821
I'm saying it's unkillable.

1432
02:29:14,832 --> 02:29:16,948
Master Wayne, are you receiving me?

1433
02:29:17,112 --> 02:29:18,112
<i>Alfred.</i>

1434
02:29:18,312 --> 02:29:19,950
<i>It's Kryptonian.</i>

1435
02:29:20,152 --> 02:29:22,268
<i>Only Kryptonite weapons can kill it.</i>

1436
02:29:22,432 --> 02:29:25,822
They might. If you had any left.

1437
02:29:26,032 --> 02:29:27,988
<i>I got one round left.</i>

1438
02:29:29,232 --> 02:29:33,384
<i>The spear. Alfred, the spear.
It's pure Kryptonite.</i>

1439
02:29:33,552 --> 02:29:34,826
<i>It's back in Gotham.</i>

1440
02:29:34,992 --> 02:29:37,825
<i>If I can penetrate the skin,
the spear will kill it.</i>

1441
02:29:37,992 --> 02:29:38,992
It would in theory.

1442
02:29:39,152 --> 02:29:42,303
<i>I've gotta get it to chase me
back to the city.</i>

1443
02:29:42,472 --> 02:29:44,193
<i>Back to the Kryptonite.</i>

1444
02:30:44,714 --> 02:30:46,352
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

1445
02:31:35,715 --> 02:31:37,512
Why did you bring him back to the city?

1446
02:31:37,675 --> 02:31:39,188
<i>The port is abandoned.</i>

1447
02:31:39,355 --> 02:31:41,152
<i>There's a weapon here that can kill it.</i>

1448
02:31:53,875 --> 02:31:55,069
Did you find the spear?

1449
02:31:55,875 --> 02:31:57,752
<i>I've been a little busy.</i>

1450
02:31:57,915 --> 02:32:01,113
This thing, this creature,
seems to feed on energy.

1451
02:32:02,876 --> 02:32:06,152
This thing is from another world.

1452
02:32:06,916 --> 02:32:07,916
My world.

1453
02:32:08,116 --> 02:32:11,267
I've killed things
from other worlds before.

1454
02:32:12,396 --> 02:32:13,545
Is she with you?

1455
02:32:14,396 --> 02:32:16,990
<i>I thought she was with you.</i>

1456
02:35:54,801 --> 02:35:55,950
Clark!

1457
02:35:56,641 --> 02:35:57,960
Clark!

1458
02:36:05,281 --> 02:36:06,634
Clark!

1459
02:36:15,561 --> 02:36:17,950
Clark!

1460
02:36:18,841 --> 02:36:20,832
Clark! Are you all right?

1461
02:36:58,082 --> 02:37:00,198
I love you.

1462
02:37:03,522 --> 02:37:07,117
No. No, Clark, you can't.

1463
02:37:08,682 --> 02:37:10,354
This is my world.

1464
02:37:10,522 --> 02:37:11,956
No, Clark, don't.

1465
02:37:15,803 --> 02:37:17,873
You are my world.

1466
02:37:18,043 --> 02:37:19,192
No.

1467
02:37:22,563 --> 02:37:24,952
Please. Clark!

1468
02:44:30,052 --> 02:44:31,052
Hi.

1469
02:44:38,253 --> 02:44:41,484
Clark had this sent here,
so he could surprise you.

1470
02:47:07,976 --> 02:47:09,568
"The dead shall live.

1471
02:47:11,056 --> 02:47:14,412
"My slain shall rise again.

1472
02:47:17,056 --> 02:47:20,128
"Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust.

1473
02:47:21,336 --> 02:47:24,806
"For thy dew is like the dew of morning.

1474
02:47:26,656 --> 02:47:31,650
"And the earth
shall give birth to her dead."

1475
02:47:39,177 --> 02:47:41,327
Ah, I need a ride
back to the house.

1476
02:47:41,497 --> 02:47:44,170
I forgot my checkbook
to pay the funeral director.

1477
02:47:44,337 --> 02:47:46,328
They said it's all taken care of.

1478
02:47:46,497 --> 02:47:48,328
By whom?

1479
02:47:48,497 --> 02:47:50,089
Anonymous donor.

1480
02:48:33,898 --> 02:48:37,971
All those circuses back east
burying an empty box.

1481
02:48:38,138 --> 02:48:40,049
They don't know how to honor him,

1482
02:48:41,138 --> 02:48:43,049
except as a soldier.

1483
02:48:44,738 --> 02:48:48,253
I've failed him in life.

1484
02:48:49,578 --> 02:48:51,614
I won't fail him in death.

1485
02:48:53,338 --> 02:48:54,896
Help me find the others like you.

1486
02:48:56,018 --> 02:48:58,088
Perhaps they don't want to be found.

1487
02:48:58,938 --> 02:49:02,089
They will. And they'll fight.

1488
02:49:02,858 --> 02:49:05,326
We have to stand together.

1489
02:49:12,619 --> 02:49:16,248
100 years ago, I walked away from mankind.

1490
02:49:17,939 --> 02:49:20,772
From a century of horrors.

1491
02:49:23,459 --> 02:49:27,247
Man made a world where
standing together is impossible.

1492
02:49:30,459 --> 02:49:32,609
Men are still good.

1493
02:49:34,779 --> 02:49:37,612
<i>We fight. We kill.</i>

1494
02:49:38,699 --> 02:49:41,054
<i>We betray one another.</i>

1495
02:49:43,019 --> 02:49:45,214
<i>But we can rebuild.</i>

1496
02:49:46,299 --> 02:49:48,369
<i>We can do better.</i>

1497
02:49:49,379 --> 02:49:50,892
<i>We will.</i>

1498
02:49:51,460 --> 02:49:52,813
<i>We have to.</i>

1499
02:50:15,740 --> 02:50:17,332
The others like me.

1500
02:50:17,500 --> 02:50:19,491
Why did you say they'll have to fight?

1501
02:50:25,020 --> 02:50:27,136
Just a feeling.

1502
02:50:38,421 --> 02:50:41,094
Prisoner A-C-23-19-40.

1503
02:50:41,261 --> 02:50:44,014
The warden wants to speak to you,
so stand to your feet.

1504
02:50:45,421 --> 02:50:47,298
I'm gonna say this one more time.

1505
02:50:47,461 --> 02:50:50,851
The warden wants to speak to you,
so stand to your feet.

1506
02:50:58,061 --> 02:51:00,291
Turn around and face the wall.

1507
02:51:01,741 --> 02:51:04,209
Place your forehead against the wall.

1508
02:51:04,381 --> 02:51:08,613
Put your hands behind your back,
so that I can come in and restrain you.

1509
02:51:36,662 --> 02:51:39,415
<i>Whatever you do, wherever you go,</i>

1510
02:51:39,582 --> 02:51:41,732
<i>I'll be watching you.</i>

1511
02:51:42,502 --> 02:51:43,821
Oh...

1512
02:51:45,102 --> 02:51:46,899
Look at us.

1513
02:51:47,702 --> 02:51:49,613
This is how it all caves in.

1514
02:51:49,822 --> 02:51:55,055
Civilization on the Wayne Manor's
out the window.

1515
02:51:55,742 --> 02:51:57,141
Mmm?

1516
02:51:59,502 --> 02:52:01,732
But who would believe me?
I...

1517
02:52:02,422 --> 02:52:04,811
I'm insane.

1518
02:52:06,143 --> 02:52:08,054
I'm not even fit to stand trial.

1519
02:52:08,223 --> 02:52:10,100
That's right.

1520
02:52:10,303 --> 02:52:14,216
We have hospitals that treat
the mentally ill with compassion.

1521
02:52:14,583 --> 02:52:17,381
But that's not where you're going.

1522
02:52:17,543 --> 02:52:21,058
I arranged for you to get transferred
to Arkham Asylum in Gotham.

1523
02:52:22,263 --> 02:52:24,731
I still have some friends there.

1524
02:52:24,903 --> 02:52:26,700
They're expecting you.

1525
02:52:30,943 --> 02:52:35,141
But the bell's already been rung.

1526
02:52:37,703 --> 02:52:39,216
And they've heard it.

1527
02:52:40,983 --> 02:52:42,382
Out in the dark.

1528
02:52:42,583 --> 02:52:45,143
Among the stars. Hmm.

1529
02:52:48,503 --> 02:52:52,213
Ding dong, the God is dead.

1530
02:53:01,584 --> 02:53:04,417
But a bell cannot be unrung!

1531
02:53:05,504 --> 02:53:09,258
He's hungry. He's found us.

1532
02:53:10,264 --> 02:53:12,255
And he's coming!

1533
02:53:15,144 --> 02:53:17,612
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding.

1534
02:53:19,944 --> 02:53:22,822
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding.

1535
02:53:24,784 --> 02:53:27,981
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding.

1536
02:53:29,544 --> 02:53:31,262
<i>Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.</i>

1537
02:53:34,464 --> 02:53:37,502
<i>Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding.</i>

1538
02:53:39,265 --> 02:53:42,621
<i>Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding.</i>
