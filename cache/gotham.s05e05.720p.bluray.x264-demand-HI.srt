1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,993
<i>- Previously on</i> Gotham...
- Where's Jeremiah?

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,516
(gasping)

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,360
BRUCE: Selina,
she's not herself, Alfred.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,760
She's desperate for revenge.

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,034
You can't save her from herself.

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,480
NYGMA: <i>This time,
woke up on a rooftop.</i>

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,360
No idea how I got there
or what happened

8
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,754
<i>during the preceding hours.</i>

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,957
GORDON: <i>In Haven,
as long as we survive,</i>

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,038
hope survives in Gotham.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,196
<i>You've been promising me
help for weeks.</i>

12
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,756
WALKER: <i>I'm working
on getting you help.</i>

13
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,835
GORDON:
I promise I won't stop

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,117
until I find those responsible.

15
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,275
I've got a lead
on a guy selling RPGs.

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,353
Oh, oh, please don't hurt me.

17
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,200
I just want to know
what you saw.

18
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,596
You had some kind of a rocket.

19
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,353
And you shot it
at that building.

20
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,160
(film projector clicking)

21
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,834
Raise your hands, Mr. Gordon.

22
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,831
I'm sorry, Steve,
they made me do it.

23
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,355
All right, be quiet, you.

24
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,176
Miss Zant, we're sorry
to interrupt your breakfast,

25
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,998
but you'll come with us,
quickly.

26
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,192
You may lower your hands now,
Mr. Gordon.

27
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,796
Turn around.

28
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,714
There a problem, Officer?

29
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,520
We know you sold the RPG
that took out Haven.

30
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,279
So?

31
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,999
So I want to know
who bought it.

32
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,797
Or what? You gonna arrest me?

33
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,318
Who said anything
about arresting you?

34
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,349
I want a name.

35
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,840
What do you say, boys?

36
00:01:41,841 --> 00:01:43,399
(guns cocking)

37
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,237
Should we show this lawman how
we feel about uninvited guests?

38
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:01,312
Now, who told you
I sold that RPG?

39
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,720
(grunting)

40
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,320
(gunshot)

41
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,110
Eduardo?

42
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,319
Nice shot, right?

43
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,439
SOLDIER:
Lower your weapon now.

44
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,519
EDUARDO:
Delta Force,

45
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,749
stand down.

46
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,480
What are you doing here?

47
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,035
Come on.
The last time I saw you,

48
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,456
you were running
through sniper fire,

49
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,631
plucking my sorry ass
from a burning truck.

50
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,914
Least I could do
was pay you back.

51
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,433
I had that guy
right where I wanted him.

52
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,310
I'm glad you're here.

53
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,309
Yeah, me, too.

54
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,398
♪♪

55
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,514
We hated each other in boot.

56
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,797
Jim disapproved
of my ops tempo.

57
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,114
(chuckles): Yeah, 'cause you
only had one speed: too fast.

58
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,896
Took me a while to
realize he wasn't afraid

59
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,673
to get his hands dirty.
Just being careful.

60
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,718
- Yeah.
- Well, Jim's taught me a thing or two

61
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,440
- about being careful.
- (laughs softly)

62
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,196
So what's the mission plan?

63
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,797
Well, we are the help
Secretary Walker promised.

64
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,680
Our goal is to make this
hellhole safe again.

65
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,000
So it took the murder of
hundreds of innocent civilians

66
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,136
to get the government to act?

67
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,038
We're here to eliminate
all criminal threats.

68
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,516
We're gonna blanket the city
with flash sweeps.

69
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,296
Well, what about the people
that are still trapped here?

70
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,040
- They need relief now.
- Hey, I'm with you,

71
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,270
but my mandate's clear:

72
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,070
first we restore order,
then we take the next steps.

73
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,200
ANGEL:
Sir.

74
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,519
We got something, sir.

75
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,874
Captain Gordon,
this is my second,

76
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,235
Sergeant Angel Vallelunga.

77
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,400
Captain.

78
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,990
Ledger.

79
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,395
Our arms dealer kept track
of his buyers.

80
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,395
"Edward Nygma.

81
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,800
Two RPG."

82
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,480
Nygma.

83
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,354
Yeah, that name's on my list.

84
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,956
Think he's our bomber?

85
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,270
Only one way to find out.

86
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,477
All right,
you and I will get Nygma.

87
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,675
Harvey, I need you to set up

88
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,638
a command center
with the soldiers at GCPD.

89
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,200
- I'll grab some guys.
- Yeah.

90
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,000
Hey, look, hey, Jim.

91
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,040
I'm not as fast
as I used to be,

92
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,480
but I still got
some fight in me.

93
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,671
I'm not a desk jockey.
I'm a street guy.

94
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,197
What you are is the best cop
that I know.

95
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,671
We're going after Nygma.
He's ten steps ahead.

96
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,080
This thing goes sideways,
you're gonna have to take over.

97
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,475
I need your help, buddy.

98
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,080
I got it.

99
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,160
(door closes)

100
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,830
Alfred.

101
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,314
Oh, there you are, Master Bruce.

102
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,115
There's been a break
in the Haven bombing.

103
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,416
Seems that Gordon and Bullock

104
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,080
have got a rather
strong lead, apparently.

105
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,880
What's the matter with you?

106
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,269
I can't find Selina.

107
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,000
I've looked all over
the Green Zone.

108
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,000
Somehow, I think Miss Kyle
is perfectly capable

109
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,878
of looking after herself,
Master Bruce.

110
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,714
Except that she's not herself.

111
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,999
You saw what she
did to Jeremiah.

112
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,754
Yes. I did.

113
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,314
Listen, come here.

114
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,155
Jeremiah Valeska
deserved to die.

115
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,073
Jeremiah made Selina a murderer.

116
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,840
Just like Ra's made me
a murderer.

117
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,959
Ra's goaded you

118
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,679
into stabbing him, Master Bruce.

119
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,477
He used you as an instrument.
You're no murderer.

120
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,720
But Selina is.

121
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,595
You're not the same.

122
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,016
She did what she did
with open eyes,

123
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,077
and you got to learn
to respect that, son.

124
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,519
You're wrong about her, Alfred.

125
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,189
And I'm gonna
go find her.

126
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
(exhales)

127
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,797
(sirens wailing,
birds squawking)

128
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,593
NYGMA:
<i>It's Monday, 5:32 p.m.</i>

129
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,896
(over recorder): I'm standing
in a dumpster. My head hurts.

130
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,195
(fast-forwards)

131
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,400
It's happened again.
It's... Saturday, 12:16 a.m.

132
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,400
My fingernails are full of dirt.

133
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,835
Have I been digging?

134
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,639
(fast-forwards)

135
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,797
I think it's Sunday.
I can't find my watch.

136
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,555
And it's dark outside,
my feet are wet.

137
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,756
There's mud everywhere.

138
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,920
God!

139
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,160
It doesn't make sense!

140
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,510
You're not a murderer, Ed.

141
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,273
Except Kristen Kringle.

142
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,874
And Officer Dougherty.

143
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,433
But all those people...
and children.

144
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,555
How could you do it?

145
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,155
Why?!

146
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,271
(panting)

147
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,834
It doesn't matter why.

148
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,950
What matters

149
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,357
is that it was you
who killed them.

150
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,750
Not me.

151
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,760
(exhales)

152
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,320
(door thuds)

153
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,080
Edward Nygma, you're under
arrest for the attack at Haven

154
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,040
and the murder of hundreds
of innocent people.

155
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,160
No.

156
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,512
No, Jim, I can explain.

157
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,400
Explain?

158
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,600
You son of a bitch.
You actually did it?

159
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,036
- On your knees, now.
- No! I didn't.

160
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,960
I can prove
it, I just,

161
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,033
I need... I need
a little bit of time.

162
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,640
Say the word, Jim.

163
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,200
You know me, Jim.

164
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,440
The people
that I...

165
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,311
have hurt, they hurt me first.

166
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,756
I didn't know
a single person in Haven.

167
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,555
I'm innocent.

168
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,350
It's your call, buddy.

169
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,359
He basically confessed.

170
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,350
We bring him in.

171
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,955
He stands trial.

172
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,909
Yeah, I don't think so.

173
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,672
(steady beeping)

174
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,355
Your friend is standing
on a pressure-plated IED

175
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,994
One of several
throughout the rooms.

176
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,194
Twitch, and you'll repaint
the room with your organs.

177
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,240
Don't do it, Jim.

178
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,676
This little doohickey
monitors my heartbeat.

179
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,630
It increases by ten? Boom.

180
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,559
Decreases by ten?

181
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,879
Boom.

182
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,136
GORDON: <i>You try to walk
out of here,</i>

183
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,480
and a special forces sniper
will put a bullet in your head.

184
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,439
No, they won't.

185
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,080
This thing can detonate his bomb
from a mile away.

186
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,475
Or am I bluffing?

187
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,549
Once word gets out that
you're responsible for Haven,

188
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,520
you'll have a target
on your back.

189
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,233
I'll take my chances.

190
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,856
(whispers):
I think he's bluffing.

191
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,880
No, no.

192
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,960
He doesn't bluff.

193
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,800
I don't want anyone here

194
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,536
- if this thing detonates.
- You heard the man.

195
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,279
Tell Sergeant Vallelunga
to stand down.

196
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,278
- Yes, sir.
- Nygma walks.

197
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,752
A wristband that monitors
his heart rate.

198
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,196
Welcome to Gotham.

199
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,355
So what we do?

200
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,959
Well, the way I see it,
now we're all tied up.

201
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,839
I just got to save your life
one more time,

202
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,316
then I'm back in the lead.

203
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,240
Funny. Seriously,
the hell are we gonna do?

204
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,515
Well, he pulled a book
to set the booby trap.

205
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,759
I think I can make it.

206
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,679
Assuming the vibrations don't
trigger the IED, what then?

207
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,279
Then we just got to figure out

208
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,880
what sort of puzzle
he wants us to solve.

209
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,120
Puzzle?

210
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,392
There's always a puzzle
with Nygma. You ready?

211
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,474
(beeping continues)

212
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,595
(mouths)

213
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,916
(exhales)

214
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,071
(panting)

215
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,156
<i>Chess Strategy: Knight Moves
Nimbly in the Dark.</i>

216
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,879
I'm gonna wring
this nerd's neck.

217
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,675
In chess,

218
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,557
knights move in an "L."

219
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,439
Two spaces straight,

220
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,912
then one at a 90-degree angle.

221
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,919
<i>Butterfly Collecting
with Conviction.</i>

222
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,195
Or...

223
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,960
<i>Chess Strategy:</i>

225
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,720
(beeps)

226
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,679
You okay?

227
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,956
You left the Army for this city?

228
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,600
It grows on you.

229
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,600
Harvey, come in.

230
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,280
BULLOCK (over radio):
Jim, you nab Nygma?

231
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,914
No. Put the word out:

232
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,159
Nygma's wanted for murder
and the attack on Haven.

233
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,670
(gunshots)

234
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,480
BRUCE:
<i>I'm looking for Selina.</i>

235
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,600
BARBARA:
<i>Follow me.</i>

236
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Everybody,

237
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,475
raise your glasses to the killer

238
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,711
of Jeremiah Valeska.

239
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,151
(cheering)

240
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,437

CROWD (chanting):

242
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,193
The freak is dead!

243
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,114
The freak is dead!
The freak is dead!

244
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,376
MAN (over radio):
Citizens of Gotham,

245
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,835
this is a special bulletin
from the police department.

246
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,679
We have identified
the person who fired

247
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,639
a rocket-propelled grenade
that decimated Haven.

248
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,076
Be on the lookout
for a tall, skinny man

249
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,354
who goes by the name
of Ed Nygma.

250
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,194
He was last seen wearing
a green suit and eyeglasses.

251
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,034
Ed Nygma.

252
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,794
The monster of Haven.

253
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,240
- Let's go get him!
- ALL: Yeah!

254
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,834
- Let's kill him!
- (cheering)

255
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,076
Kill him!

256
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,993
ALL (chanting):
Kill him! Kill him!

257
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,880
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!

258
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,229
Excellent.

259
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,190
200 bullets, as promised.
Go have fun.

260
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,816
And there's more
where that came from

261
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,160
if you keep up the good work.

262
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,835
Off you go.

263
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,472
Mr. Cobblepot, sir.

264
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,472
- It's...
- What? What?

265
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,914
"Edward Nygma
is the monster res...

266
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,833
responsible for killing
the innocents at Haven."

267
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,119
(strained):
Ed, what have you done?

268
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,637
I saw him go that way!
He's over there!

269
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,234
Get him! Come on!

270
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,079
(overlapping shouting)

271
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,976
ANGEL (over radio):
Bang Zero-One.

272
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,434
This is Bird Zero-Two.

273
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,920
What's your status, Angel?

274
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,839
ANGEL:
We cleared 13th to 36th Street,

275
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,038
west of Broadway.
Gonna keep pushing uptown.

276
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,594
That's progress.
Still no Nygma.

277
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,590
My boys will scoop him up
by nightfall.

278
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,510
Now tell me about this...
Scarecrow.

279
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,279
Well, he has
chemical weapons.

280
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,954
Your guys will need gas masks.

281
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,279
But taking him down
would be a big win.

282
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,079
Well, that's why
we're here.

283
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,429
Psst. Hey.

284
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,115
(singsongy):
Time to wake up.

285
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,430
(gasping)

286
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,359
Who are you?

287
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,797
I'm the woman who's gonna
carry out your execution.

288
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,155
(both whooping)

289
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,400
(whooping)

290
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,190
(laughter)

291
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,558
(grunting, gasping)

292
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,153
That's just a taste.

293
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:39,196
It's only fair you die
slow and painful

294
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,114
to pay for JoJo.

295
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,110
Who's JoJo?

296
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,479
JoJo was in Haven

297
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,994
when you blew it up.

298
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,074
(laughing)

299
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,435
This is a joke, right?

300
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,353
300 people died in Haven.

301
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,319
(scoffs)

302
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,113
We don't care about people.

303
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,317
- MAN: Yeah!
- (laughter)

304
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,432
Look at how happy JoJo was.

305
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:19,119
(crying): He always had
a smile on his face.

306
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,480
You anthropomorphizing
nincompoop.

307
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,958
Dogs can't smile.

308
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,074
- (screaming)
- (whooping)

309
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,920
(shouts)

310
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,714
I'm going to fix you, Ed.

311
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,719
What the hell?

312
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,315
Floor it!

313
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,713
- (whooping)
- Yeah!

314
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,952
(whooping)
Yeah!

315
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,116
Yeah!

316
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,031
I'm going to fix you, Ed.

317
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,676
Did I say stop?

318
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:25,840
I'm sorry, Ma.

319
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,280
Ma, can't we just
beat him to death?

320
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,796
(engine stalling)

321
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,030
It's not starting.

322
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,999
Yes. Anything but electrocution.

323
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,398
Please don't let
me die this way.

324
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,155
Oh, thank God
the fuel line's clogged.

325
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,076
Unclog the line.

326
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,391
- (laughs)
- We got it, we got it. Come on.

327
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,155
- (laughing)
- Please.

328
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,391
Shoot me, stab me,

329
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,074
anything but another jolt.

330
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,554
Hit it.

331
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,440
Oh, no!

332
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,718
(gasping)

333
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,200
(screaming)

334
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,840
GRETEL:
Put it out!

335
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,236
Boys!
Oh, my Lord!

336
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,432
Help him! Help him!

337
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,512
(yelping)

338
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,478
Who's gonna fix who, Oswald?

339
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,269
HENCHMAN: The Army's invading
the city, locking everyone up.

340
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,640
They're coming this way.

341
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:43,277
Please. An invasion
is tanks, infantry.

342
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,910
These are scouts.

343
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,679
What about Nygma?

344
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,656
HENCHMAN: Nobody's seen him,
but we got feelers out.

345
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:52,674
Well, you tell
your "feelers"

346
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,951
that the first man
to bring me Nygma

347
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,157
is the one who
gets to live.

348
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,080
Now!

349
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,229
(sighs)

350
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,837
(laughs)

351
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,036
I am surrounded
by morons, Edward.

352
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,520
If I didn't have
an empire to run,

353
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,758
I would go get Nygma myself.
(chuckles)

354
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,399
(gasps)

355
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,030
Hello, Oswald. We have
a great deal to talk about.

356
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,550
But first,

357
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,469
did you name your dog after me?

358
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,437
BULLOCK:
Jim, Harper just radioed.

359
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,432
She saw Nygma going
into City Hall.

360
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,875
He's going to Penguin.

361
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,736
EDUARDO: Cobblepot's
at the top of my list

362
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,717
from Walker.
Sounds like a twofer.

363
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,096
GORDON:
Penguin's sitting on all

364
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,315
the ammo in Gotham.

365
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,560
He's better defended,
better manned than anyone else.

366
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,240
We need shock and awe.

367
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,034
Shock and awe is my default.

368
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,840
You ready?

369
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,278
You know what,
take Harvey on this one.

370
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,760
I'll keep things
locked down here.

371
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,270
Let's saddle up.

372
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,797
(rock music playing)

373
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,111
Man, you're killing
my buzz.

374
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,476
Selina.

375
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,796
I know you, and
this isn't you.

376
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,472
- You know me?
- Yes.

377
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,351
Maybe better
than you know yourself.

378
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,199
Let me tell you something.

379
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,910
That night

380
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,913
that your parents were murdered,

381
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,310
I was in that alley

382
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,393
on the fire escape.

383
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,749
And I watched
that guy

384
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,959
shoot your father

385
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,159
and shoot your mother.

386
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,592
And through it all,

387
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,636
I did... nothing.

388
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,473
(laughs)

389
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,911
I didn't call for help,
I didn't...

390
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,676
(crying): I didn't scream
for the guy to stop.

391
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,315
It wasn't your fault.
You were just a scared kid.

392
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,554
No.

393
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,830
You were the scared kid.

394
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,758
We are not the same, Bruce.

395
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,678
I didn't do anything because
I wasn't willing to risk my neck

396
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,560
for someone else
because I didn't care.

397
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,557
That's who I was
and that's who I am.

398
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,798
("Psycho" by Grim Streaker
playing)

399
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,160
I love this song.

400
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,753
♪ When I want to go,
I know what you'll say... ♪

401
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,598
What did you do to me, Oswald?

402
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,000
What are you talking about?

403
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,389
Oh, please.

404
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,597
You did something to me.

405
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,560
You...

406
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,632
You are the reason

407
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,439
that I killed those people.

408
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,309
How could you?

409
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,956
You have made me
into some murderous puppet.

410
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,594
For weeks, I've been waking up
in strange places,

411
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,634
not knowing how I got there
or what I did.

412
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,280
Driving myself mad,

413
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,318
thinking I had gone mad.

414
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,596
And now I know
that it was all your doing.

415
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,719
Of everything

416
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,552
that you have put me through,

417
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,396
this...

418
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,151
this is the most cruel.

419
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,560
Ed.

420
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,035
I don't know
what you're talking about.

421
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,952
I did not make
you do anything.

422
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,237
Then what is "I'll fix you"?

423
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,111
What did that mean?
You didn't fix me.

424
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,789
You broke me!

425
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,759
W-W-Wait. No.

426
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,117
I said that to you the night
the bridges blew. I-I...

427
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,800
Think I wouldn't remember?

428
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,118
No, Ed, I saved your life!

429
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,680
That's it!

430
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,830
What are you talking about?

431
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,716
You had been stabbed, I paid
Hugo Strange to save your life.

432
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,040
I bet he did something to you

433
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,719
when he was
patching you up.

434
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,079
You paid Hugo Strange
to save me?

435
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,520
Why?

436
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,712
What was I supposed to do?
Let you die?

437
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,319
After Butch,
you were my only friend.

438
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,596
You shot Butch!

439
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,918
Which is why I needed you!

440
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,280
(shouts)

441
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,029
(exhales)

442
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,036
Edward Nygma,

443
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,993
if I wanted
you to suffer,

444
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,114
I would never do it
in some backhanded way.

445
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,835
If you and I

446
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,000
are ever at
odds again,

447
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,797
you will know, without a doubt,

448
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,795
that I am your enemy.

449
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,396
I promise you that...

450
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,913
(crying):
...as a friend.

451
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,316
(grunts)

452
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,911
(panting)

453
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,676
What a mess.

454
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,357
I might have killed you, Oswald.

455
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,954
And if that day comes...
I swear to you...

456
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,555
...I will stare you in the eye

457
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,631
as I stab you in the heart.

458
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,395
(laughs softly)

459
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,799
(sniffles)

460
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,029
Look on the bright side.

461
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,590
If Hugo Strange did
do something to you,

462
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,519
it means you are not
responsible for Haven.

463
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:57,999
Where is he?

464
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,957
(rumbling)

465
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,478
Sir, GCPD and the Army
have blown the gates.

466
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,956
Stay here. You'll be safe.

467
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,673
(quietly): Grab Nygma.
They want him, not me.

468
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,956
He's gone.

469
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,950
Idiot! Ugh!

470
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,959
(high-pitched whirring)

471
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,680
(guns cocking)

472
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,393
(laughs)

473
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,957
Why, hello, Harvey.

474
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,880
Now, last time
we were in a standoff,

475
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,555
you ran out of bullets.

476
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,556
(laughs)

477
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,072
I hope you're better prepared.

478
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,070
We don't want to take
your territory, Oswald.

479
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,273
But you have to put down
your weapons

480
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,033
and hand over Ed Nygma.

481
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,154
Or, if you and your friends
aren't out

482
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,471
by the time I
count to three,

483
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,554
I will mow you all down!

484
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,200
We good?

485
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Yep.

486
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,710
Go ahead. Count.

487
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,518
(laughs)

488
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,639
Harvey, you're not
thinking clearly.

489
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,273
Maybe call your boss,

490
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,835
see what he thinks.

491
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,198
I don't have
to call anyone.

492
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,594
Go ahead. Count.

493
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,360
One...

494
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,830
(panting)

495
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,919
How's that for better prepared?

496
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,439
Where's Ed Nygma?

497
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,519
The whole of Gotham
is looking for you.

498
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,877
I need information,
your specialty.

499
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,356
I am going to cut

500
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,797
your face
into a jigsaw puzzle

501
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,880
and watch you try
and put it back together again.

502
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,674
Barbara... Barbara! Am I dumb?

503
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,676
In all the years of plotting

504
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,274
and the betrayals between us,

505
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,672
have you ever... ever...
known me to do something

506
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,433
as idiotically brutal
as shoot a rocket

507
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,160
into a building full
of innocent people?

508
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,793
I did not kill
those people in Haven.

509
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,830
Not exactly.

510
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,400
There's more going on here.

511
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,240
I'm waiting.

512
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,630
The night the
bridges fell,

513
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,840
I was hurt. Oswald took me
to Hugo Strange.

514
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,799
And he did something
to my brain.

515
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,555
And that's your excuse for
murdering hundreds of people?

516
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,555
I'm saying that
Strange, or somebody,

517
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,274
can control me.

518
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,879
They killed those people.

519
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,276
Okay, let's say,
by some miracle, I believe you.

520
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,433
Why the hell should I help you?

521
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,478
Because who's working
with Strange?

522
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,434
Who would force me
to kill all of those people?

523
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,312
Information is
your lifeblood.

524
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:40,830
You help me, and I will give you
the best intel you've ever had.

525
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,039
I don't know where Strange is.

526
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,791
But I can tell you
where you'll find his Igors.

527
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,799
(punch lands)

528
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,800
(grunts)

529
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,316
Where is Edward Nygma?

530
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,673
You're protecting
a mass murderer.

531
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,634
Don't look to me for sympathy.

532
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,515
Fine.

533
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,791
But not with
that meathead around.

534
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,159
(laughs)

535
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,032
You know, they say you can judge
a man by his friends.

536
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,152
This from a man
who has no friends.

537
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,120
Talk.

538
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,035
Nygma's a patsy.

539
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,599
He is not a
mass murderer.

540
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,551
Puzzles, games,

541
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:42,594
perhaps the odd killing here and
there, but hundreds of people?

542
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,033
No. That's not him.
You know this.

543
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,880
So who set him up?

544
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,358
(laughs)

545
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,359
Jim, you want information,

546
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,920
I want to go home.

547
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,520
Eduardo's not gonna go for that.

548
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,876
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you were in charge.

549
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,073
Even if I were
to let you go,

550
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,429
sooner or later,
the Army's gonna come for you.

551
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,834
Things are changing in Gotham.

552
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,314
I'll take my chances.

553
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,356
Now,

554
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,234
do you want Nygma or not?

555
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,759
I know where Nygma's going.

556
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,118
I trust you know
what you're doing.

557
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,719
We do what we have to do, right?

558
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,720
Gentlemen.

559
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,394
Come in. You're late.

560
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:10,357
The last body you procured
for me was gangrenous.

561
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,792
Completely unsuitable.

562
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,110
Oh, my.

563
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,200
Bye.

564
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,356
Hello, Professor.

565
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,999
(chuckles)

566
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,160
Mr. Nygma.

567
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,456
Let's skip the part
where you deny

568
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,960
making me into
a killing machine.

569
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:33,874
Tell me how you took control
of my alter ego.

570
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,075
I don't follow.

571
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,597
You did something
to access

572
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,513
the Ed Nygma side
of my personality.

573
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,394
But... you're Ed Nygma.

574
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,835
I'm also the Riddler!

575
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,078
Tell me what you did!

576
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,672
Why did you make me
kill all those people

577
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,876
in Haven?

578
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,476
You did that?

579
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,229
How interesting.

580
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,194
I had no idea.

581
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,919
You really expect
me to believe that?

582
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:03,034
Mr. Nygma, I don't know
anything about

583
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,317
your alter egos.

584
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,114
But I will confess that

585
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,636
when I was sewing up
your knife wound,

586
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,470
I may have tinkered a little
with your grey matter.

587
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,155
- Would you just...
- I put a chip in your brain.

588
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,717
It allows you to be able
to be controlled remotely.

589
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,916
I knew it.

590
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,639
But I don't control you.

591
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,037
I gave control to others.

592
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,200
Who?

593
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,233
I will write it down.

594
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,191
That way,
if I'm ever confronted,

595
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,478
I can honestly say
that I never told you.

596
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,960
(sighs)

597
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,120
(thuds)

598
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,114
Not to worry.

599
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,031
You're experiencing a
simple neural cutout.

600
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,192
I am mystified as to
how you've become aware

601
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,352
you're being controlled.

602
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:10,398
I suppose we're just going
to have to open you up

603
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,958
and take a look under the hood.

604
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,349
Won't we?

605
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,759
Jim.

606
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,433
Sorry, kid, it's just me.

607
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,640
You all right?

608
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,874
Yeah, I'm just, uh,
just looking for Jim.

609
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,040
It's nothing.

610
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,119
I saw soldiers downstairs.

611
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,437
Yeah, the Army's
finally gotten off their asses

612
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,600
and decided to help.

613
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,160
Jim's out
with them now.

614
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,674
Are you sure you're all right?

615
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,352
(distant gunfire)

616
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,950
I don't know.

617
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,080
I see people losing
their will to do good.

618
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,360
People I love.

619
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,040
What if we don't make it
out of this?

620
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,390
I'm not gonna lie, kid.

621
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:08,480
These past few months,
I've wondered the same thing.

622
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,136
And when I don't know
what to do,

623
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,834
I come up here and I dig into
these case files.

624
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,557
I sit my ass down
and I get to work.

625
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,239
I used to hate this
kind of paperwork;

626
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,120
now it's the only thing
that keeps me going.

627
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,479
Why?

628
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,631
Because the little
things matter.

629
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,511
Act by act, deed by deed,
it means something.

630
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,680
Even if no one notices

631
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,160
or cares.

632
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,760
Thanks, Harvey.

633
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,950
You're welcome, kid.

634
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,031
If you really want
to do an old man a favor,

635
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:48,040
you can scrounge me up
a cup of joe because I, uh...

636
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,355
Kid's fast.

637
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,717
(drill whirs)

638
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,151
I apologize for the discomfort.

639
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,197
The neural cutout inhibits
muscular function,

640
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,037
but not pain receptors.

641
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,838
A simple reboot of the chip
should be all that is required.

642
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,992
- Although, the sound may be...
- (drill whirring)

643
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:18,713
...uh, somewhat unpleasant.
Not to mention the smell.

644
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,278
(Edward groaning)

645
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,354
(Edward snorts)

646
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,596
(grunts)

647
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,190
(Edward yips, growls)

648
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,398
(Oswald panting)

649
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,358
(Edward whines)

650
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,120
(sighs)

651
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,595
(inhales sharply)

652
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,554
Edward, I believe
the time has come

653
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,632
for a change of scenery.

654
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,560
(chuckles)

655
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,238
It seems a powerful
electrical charge

656
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,596
overloaded your chip, but I've
gotten everything updated.

657
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:36,311
I will pass the good news
along to your handler.

658
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,789
(gun cocks)

659
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,280
Care to expand on that?

660
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:44,598
I was merely helping a man
who needed medical attention.

661
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,354
Yeah, not buying it.

662
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,880
His eyes are open.

663
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,720
I gave him
a biomedical anesthesia.

664
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,997
Wake him up now. Do it.

665
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,311
Oh, very well.

666
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,637
(screams)

667
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,080
Oh!

668
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,958
I told you this wasn't me!

669
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,440
He put a chip
in my brain.

670
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,671
And someone's been controlling
it this whole time.

671
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,280
And then he
drilled in my head!

672
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,000
- Better talk now.
- (Nygma sighs)

673
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,276
I am a scientist.

674
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,992
A contract came along;
I developed a tool.

675
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,199
"A tool"?

676
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,200
How dare you?

677
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,953
A contract from who?

678
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,350
Please escort
the professor out, thank you.

679
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,715
Ta-ta.

680
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,116
What the hell is going on?

681
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:42,035
Sorry, pal, but this part
of the op is need-to-know.

682
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,496
I couldn't say anything until
we had the suspect in custody,

683
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,433
but Walker wants Ed Nygma
taken out now.

684
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,919
Walker was behind this?

685
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,596
She's been controlling Nygma
the whole time?

686
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,550
(scoffs)

687
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,957
You know I hate this spook crap.

688
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,157
I don't ask questions;
I follow orders.

689
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,118
She's responsible for Haven?

690
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,639
I don't understand, why...

691
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,792
Jim, stop right there, trust me.

692
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,632
Walker wants you
to put a bullet

693
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,390
in his brain.

694
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,320
No.

695
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,279
Call it proof of loyalty.

696
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:24,074
It's what she needs from you
before she can move forward

697
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,038
with final relief plans.

698
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,235
Hey, come on.

699
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,760
Look at him.

700
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,080
He's a loon.

701
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,509
A cop-killer.

702
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,113
Tell me the truth.

703
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,950
Did Walker destroy Haven?
Did you know?

704
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,715
- Tell me.
- Jim, ours is not to reason why.

705
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,032
And this is your chance
to be a part of this mission.

706
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,080
So...

707
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,800
please.

708
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,629
You pull the
trigger on him,

709
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,434
or I pull the trigger on you.

710
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,549
After all this, you'd kill me
for some bureaucrat?

711
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,593
Mission comes first.

712
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,916
You taught me that.

713
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,960
What's your answer?

714
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,671
Looks like I saved your life
one too many times.

715
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,393
- Maybe so.
- (grunts)

716
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,920
(Eduardo grunts)

717
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,714
You know Jim Gordon.

718
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,916
You know this city.

719
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,200
Find him.

720
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,280
And kill him.

721
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,315
(hammering)

722
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,032
(scraping on stone)

723
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,800
(gasps)

724
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,079
Boss. Wake up.

725
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,596
Wake up.

726
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,269
Ouch.

727
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,475
Oh! Stitches still sore, huh?

728
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,199
Never would
have happened

729
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,317
if you wore that armor
I prepared.

730
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:44,632
That bullet
is making you sentimental.

731
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,152
Give her a shake, huh?

732
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,515
Hmm. Better?

733
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,157
I told you I had to let
Selina thrust the knife

734
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,676
into my flesh at least once.

735
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:04,074
Verisimilitude
trumps precaution, you see.

736
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,440
I get it.

737
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,916
Selina Kyle and Bruce Wayne
needed to think

738
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,230
you were dead, boss.

739
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,518
Yeah. Right.

740
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,680
(gasps)

741
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,519
I take it you have news?

742
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,753
All systems go.

743
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,752
- Well, then lead the way.
- Oh!

744
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,636
Doctor.

745
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,913
I'm hearing good things.

746
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,999
The bandages are ready
to come off.

747
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,951
Your assistant thought
you'd like to see the results.

748
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,755
Indeed, I would.

749
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,474
(laughs)

750
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:08,031
Oh, you two look beautiful.

751
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,193
Oh...

752
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,039
I love family reunions,
don't you?
