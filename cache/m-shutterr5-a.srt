2
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,219
Pull yourself together Teddy.

3
00:01:10,559 --> 00:01:12,239
Pull yourself together.

4
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:18,439
It's just water.

5
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:22,439
It's alotta water.

6
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,639
Come on.

7
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:56,959
- You okay boss?
- Yeah, fine, Im just...I just can't-

8
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:59,559
I just can't stomach the water.

9
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:04,639
- You're my new partner?
- That's right.

10
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:08,639
Not the best way to meet with
my head half way down the toilet.

11
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,559
Doesn't exactly square with
Teddy Daniels, the man, the legend, I'll give you that.

12
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:13,839
The legend?

13
00:02:14,559 --> 00:02:16,539
What the hell are you boys smoking
over there in Portland, anyway?

14
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:17,719
Seattle.

15
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:19,719
I came from the office in Seattle.

16
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,239
How long you been with Marshals?

17
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:25,839
Four years.

18
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:30,439
- So you know how small it is?
- Sure.

19
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:35,039
What about you? Got a girl? Married?

20
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,359
I was.

21
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:50,159
She died.

22
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:53,639
- Jesus ..., I didn't...
- Don't worry about it.

23
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:57,839
There was a fire at the apartment
building, while I was at work.

24
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,639
Four People died.

25
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:02,239
It was the smoke that got her,
not the fire.

26
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:05,239
- That's important.
-  Sorry boss.

27
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:08,439
Where are my goddamn cigarettes?

28
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:10,799
Here, have one of mine.

29
00:03:10,839 --> 00:03:13,959
I could swear that they were in my jacket
before I...

30
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,439
Government employees, they'll rob you blind.

31
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,159
Thanks.

32
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:23,639
Give you a briefing
about the institution before you left?

33
00:03:23,679 --> 00:03:26,159
All I know is it's a mental hospital.

34
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,439
For the criminally insane.

35
00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:32,359
Well, if it was just folks running around hearing voices

36
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:35,239
and chasing after butterflies, 
they wouldn't need us.
- Yeah

37
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:47,239
- That's where were headed?
- Yep.

38
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:49,839
The other side of the island is rock bluffs,

39
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,239
all the way down to the edge of the water.

40
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:56,439
The dock, it's the
only way on, or off.

41
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:59,439
We will be casting off as soon as
you two are ashore.

42
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:02,239
I'd appreciate it if ya hurry up about it

43
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,639
- Why?
- Storm's coming.

44
00:04:30,359 --> 00:04:32,239
Never seen a Marshals'
badge before.

45
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:36,039
I'm Deputy Warden
McPherson gentlemen.

46
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:39,439
Welcome to Shutter Island.
I'll be the one taking you up to Ashecliff.

47
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:54,839
Your boys seem a little on edge,
Mr McPherson.

48
00:04:55,239 --> 00:04:57,439
Right now Marshal, we all are.

49
00:05:14,239 --> 00:05:17,039


50
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,519
Electrified perimeter.

51
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:44,639
How can you tell?

52
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,639
I've seen something like it before.

53
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:18,839
All right, you gentlemen will be accorded
all the help we can give.

54
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:23,439
But during your stay you will
obey protocol, is that understood?

55
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,839
Absolutely.

56
00:06:25,359 --> 00:06:28,439
The red brick building on my right
is ward A, the male ward.

57
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,159
Ward B, the female ward, is the one
on your left.

58
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:36,239
Ward C, is that building on the bluffs,

59
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,639
an old civil war fort, the most dangerous patients
are housed there.

60
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:42,839
Admittance to ward C is forbidden without
the written consent and

61
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:45,239
physical presence of both myself and Dr Cawley.

62
00:06:45,719 --> 00:06:47,039
Is that understood?

63
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:50,839
You act like insanity is catching.

64
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:56,119
You are hereby required to surrender
your firearms.

65
00:06:58,239 --> 00:07:01,439
Mr McPherson, we are duly appointed
federal Marshals,

66
00:07:01,559 --> 00:07:03,839
we are required to carry our
firearms with us at all times.

67
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:06,839
Executive order 319 of the Federal Code of
Penitentiaries states that

68
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:08,919
When inside the penitentiary,

69
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:12,039
the officers of that institution
have the final authority.

70
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:17,439
Gentlemen, you will not get through this
gate with your firearms.

71
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:40,159
Ok, now the official stuff is done,
come on boys.

72
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,159
What do you say we go find Dr Cawley?

73
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:56,759
- So when did she escape? 
- This prisoner?

74
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:59,639
I'm afraid Dr Cawley will have to
fill you in on the situation.

75
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:00,839
Protocol.

76
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:03,039
Correctional officers at a mental institution,

77
00:08:03,119 --> 00:08:05,328
that's a weired sight,
if you don't mind me saying.

78
00:08:05,428 --> 00:08:08,320
It's the only facility of it's kind in the U.S.

79
00:08:07,559 --> 00:08:10,959
Even in the world. We take only the most dangerous,
damaged patients.

80
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:14,559
Ones no other hospitals can manage.
And it's all due to Dr Cawley.

81
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:17,959
He's created something really unique here.
It's a hospital, for people in society who normally ...

82
00:08:47,239 --> 00:08:48,839
IDs gentlemen.

83
00:08:52,439 --> 00:08:54,039
Show your badges, gentlemen.

84
00:08:54,239 --> 00:08:56,359
Dr Cawley's been consulted
numerous times.

85
00:08:56,439 --> 00:09:00,484
- By Scotland Yard, MI 5, the OSS ...
- Why?

86
00:09:00,484 --> 00:09:02,639
What do you mean?

87
00:09:04,319 --> 00:09:07,719
What would intelligence agencies want
to consult a psychatrist about?

88
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,439
I guess you'll have to ask him.

89
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:21,039
- Marshal Daniels.
- Doctor.

90
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:22,839
Marshal Aule.

91
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:26,839
- Thank you deputy warden, that will be all.
- Yes, sir.

92
00:09:27,719 --> 00:09:29,159
Pleasure, gentlemen.

93
00:09:30,439 --> 00:09:32,039
He had a lot to say about you.

94
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,039
McPherson is a good man,
he believes in the work we do here.

95
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,439
And what would that be exactly?

96
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,639
A moral fusion between law and
order and clinical care.

97
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,039
Pardon me Doc,
a what between what and what?

98
00:09:50,439 --> 00:09:52,719
Those paintings are quite accurate.

99
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,119
It used to be the kind of patients we
deal with here, were

100
00:09:56,239 --> 00:09:58,639
shackled and left in their own filth,

101
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:02,199
they were beaten,
as if whipping them bloody would drive the psychosis out.

102
00:10:02,239 --> 00:10:07,039
We drove screws into their brains, we
submerged them in icy water until they lost consciousness,

103
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:10,159
or...even drowned.

104
00:10:10,439 --> 00:10:12,399
- And now?
- We treat them.

105
00:10:12,439 --> 00:10:14,239
Trying to heal, try to cure

106
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:18,839
And if that fails, at least we provide them
with a measure of comfort in their lives, calm.

107
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:20,839
These are all...

108
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:23,039
violent offenders, right?

109
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,959
I mean, they've hurt people,

110
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:28,239
- murdered them in some cases.
- In almost all cases. Yes.

111
00:10:29,439 --> 00:10:32,639
Then personally Doctor, I'd have to
say... screw their sense of calm.

112
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,239
It's my job to treat my patients, not their victims. I'm not here to judge.

113
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:41,039
- So this female prisoner ...
- Patient.

114
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:46,039
Excuse me, patient,
one Rachel Solando.

115
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:49,159
- Escaped sometime in the last 24 hours.
- Last night.

116
00:10:49,239 --> 00:10:51,159
Between 10 and midnight.

117
00:10:51,239 --> 00:10:53,639
- Is she considered dangerous?
- You could say that.

118
00:10:54,439 --> 00:10:55,839
She killed all three of her children.

119
00:10:56,839 --> 00:10:58,639
She drowned them in the lake, behind the house.

120
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,559
She took them out one by one and held their
heads under till they died.

121
00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:06,439
Then she brought them back inside and
arranged them around the kitchen table.

122
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:08,559
She ate a meal there
before a neighbour dropped by.

123
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,159
And what about the husband?

124
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:15,959
He died on the beaches of Normandy,
she's a war widow.

125
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:20,239
She starved herself when first she came here,
she insisted the children weren't dead.

126
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,039
- Sorry doctor, you don't happen to have an aspirin, do you?
- Prone to headaches Marshal?

127
00:11:35,359 --> 00:11:36,519
Sometimes, but today I'm a...

128
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:39,839
- little more prone to seasickness.
-Ah, dehydration ...

129
00:11:40,239 --> 00:11:41,799
- You allright boss?
- Yeh.

130
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,239
In that case you're quite right,
the simpler the better.

131
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:46,239
Ah, thanks so much.

132
00:11:46,719 --> 00:11:49,039
Rachel, still believes
the children are alive.

133
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,839
She also believes this place is her home
in the Berkshires.

134
00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:56,199
You're kidding me.

135
00:11:56,239 --> 00:11:59,239
She never once in two years acknowledged
that she is in an institution.

136
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,559
She believes we're all ...

137
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,639
deliverymen, milkmen, postal workers.

138
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:07,439
To sustain the illusion that her children never died
she created an elaborate fictional structure,

139
00:12:07,479 --> 00:12:10,239
she gives us all parts to play in that fiction.

140
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:15,839
- So have you, you searched the grounds yet?
- The warden and his men scoured the island.

141
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:17,239
Not a trace.

142
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:20,719
What's more disturbing, is that we don't know
how she got out of her room.

143
00:12:22,439 --> 00:12:23,839
It was locked from the outside.

144
00:12:24,719 --> 00:12:26,239
and the only window's barred.

145
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,359
It's as if she evaporated straight
through the walls.

146
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,959
Brought her right back here after
group therapy, locked her in,

147
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:43,839
I came back for midnight rounds,
she was gone.

148
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,839
Seriously doctor, how is it possible that
the truth never gets through to her?

149
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:57,239
I mean she's in a mental institution, right?

150
00:12:57,959 --> 00:12:59,839
Seems like something you'd
notice from time to time.

151
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:03,039
- How many pairs of shoes do the patients get?
- Two pairs.

152
00:13:03,439 --> 00:13:05,559
Sanity is not a choice, Marshal.

153
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:07,639
You can't just choose to get over it.

154
00:13:08,239 --> 00:13:11,039
So ... she left here barefoot?

155
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:15,039
Come on doc, she can't get ten
yards in that terrain.

156
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:16,968
Marshal?

157
00:13:33,838 --> 00:13:35,238


158
00:13:35,358 --> 00:13:37,358
That is definitely Rachel's
handwriting.

159
00:13:37,438 --> 00:13:41,838
- I have no idea what the " law of 4" is though.
- Not a psychiatric term?

160
00:13:41,878 --> 00:13:43,038
I'm afraid not.

161
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:44,438
Who is 67?

162
00:13:45,718 --> 00:13:46,718
Fuck if I know.

163
00:13:46,838 --> 00:13:49,718
I'd have to say that's quite
close to my clinical conclusion.

164
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:52,238
So you think it's just
random scribblings?

165
00:13:52,438 --> 00:13:55,958
No, not at all. Rachel is smart,
brilliant in fact.

166
00:13:56,238 --> 00:13:58,838
- This paper could be important.
- Excuse me Doctor, but ...

167
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:01,438
- were gonna have to hold onto this.
- Of course.

168
00:14:03,558 --> 00:14:05,318
And you say she had to come through here.

169
00:14:06,438 --> 00:14:09,718
After lights out, the orderlies play
cards in here.

170
00:14:10,318 --> 00:14:15,038
Last night there were 7 men sitting
at the base of those stairs playing stud poker.

171
00:14:15,318 --> 00:14:18,238
And yet somehow, Rachel managed
to slip past them.

172
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,318
Why?

173
00:14:20,838 --> 00:14:22,318
How? She turns invisible?

174
00:14:23,318 --> 00:14:26,438
Doctor, we gonna need access to the personal files
of all the medical staff-

175
00:14:26,518 --> 00:14:28,238
The nurses, the guards, the orderlies and,

176
00:14:28,358 --> 00:14:31,518
- anyone who was working here that night.
- We take your request under consideration.

177
00:14:31,718 --> 00:14:34,358
This is not a request, Doctor.

178
00:14:34,638 --> 00:14:37,038
This is a federal facility
and a dangerous prisoner ...

179
00:14:37,078 --> 00:14:39,238
- Patient.
- Patient.

180
00:14:39,358 --> 00:14:43,438
- Has escaped now. You will comply or....
- All I can say is that I will see what I can do.

181
00:14:43,638 --> 00:14:47,518
Doctor, were gonna need to speak with the staff,
do you understand?

182
00:14:48,838 --> 00:14:51,238
I'll assemble them in the
common room after dinner.

183
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:56,518
If you have any further questions
feel free to join the deputy warden in the search.

184
00:15:08,238 --> 00:15:11,158
It's 11 miles to the nearest land
and the water is freezing.

185
00:15:11,558 --> 00:15:13,838
The current was strong last night
the tide pushin in.

186
00:15:14,638 --> 00:15:18,558
She'd have drowned or been crushed on
the rocks and her body would have washed back up on shore.

187
00:15:22,038 --> 00:15:24,438
What about those caves down there
have you checked them?

188
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:26,958
No way she could get there.

189
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:31,518
The base of those cliffs are covered
in poison ivy, live oak, sumac

190
00:15:31,638 --> 00:15:34,338
and a thousand plants with thorns
as big as my dick.

191
00:15:35,038 --> 00:15:38,438
You said yourself Marshal,
she's got no shoes.

192
00:15:43,158 --> 00:15:45,838
All right, 
let's check the other side!

193
00:15:50,718 --> 00:15:53,518
- What's that tower?
- It's an old lighthouse.

194
00:15:54,438 --> 00:15:56,438
The guards already searched inside it.

195
00:15:58,838 --> 00:16:02,638
- What's in there? more patients?
- Sewage treatment facility.

196
00:16:03,318 --> 00:16:05,118
It's gettin dark soon.

197
00:16:05,638 --> 00:16:06,938
I'm calling this off for the night.

198
00:16:07,318 --> 00:16:08,638
Let's go, boys!

199
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:14,918
- You were on watch on the landing, huh?
- Yes.

200
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:19,238
Could nobody get in or out of their room
on that corridor without me seeing.

201
00:16:19,638 --> 00:16:20,838
Ok Rachel Solando.

202
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:24,038
Who else does she have to pass
to get down here?

203
00:16:30,038 --> 00:16:31,238
Me.

204
00:16:31,638 --> 00:16:32,718
Glen Miga.

205
00:16:33,638 --> 00:16:37,438
- Sir, I aint seen nothing.
- And you were at your post all night?

206
00:16:37,718 --> 00:16:39,638
Yeh. But I didn't see a thing.

207
00:16:41,438 --> 00:16:42,718
Glen?

208
00:16:44,518 --> 00:16:45,838
Glen?

209
00:16:48,438 --> 00:16:49,838
Tell me the truth.

210
00:16:54,518 --> 00:16:56,358
I .. I.. maybe went to the bathroom.

211
00:16:56,838 --> 00:17:01,438
- What? You breached protocol? Christ ...
- I wasn't gone longer than a minute.

212
00:17:02,318 --> 00:17:04,958
All right, let's back up here,
let's all just back up.

213
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:07,958
Mrs Solando was put in her room for lights out.

214
00:17:08,438 --> 00:17:10,558
Does anybody here know what she did
before that?

215
00:17:11,438 --> 00:17:12,638
Anyone?

216
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:15,318
Come on, anyone. anyone anyone.

217
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,438
She was in a group therapy session.

218
00:17:20,638 --> 00:17:22,438
Oh.. Did anything unusual occur?

219
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:24,638
Define "unusual".

220
00:17:25,358 --> 00:17:27,718
- Excuse me.
- It's a mental institution, Marshal,

221
00:17:28,438 --> 00:17:30,238
for the criminally insane.

222
00:17:30,438 --> 00:17:32,538
"Usual"  isn't a big part of our day.

223
00:17:34,238 --> 00:17:35,638
I will rephrase.

224
00:17:36,158 --> 00:17:39,238
Did anything happen last night
during group therapy, that was more...

225
00:17:39,838 --> 00:17:42,718
- let's say, I don't know- memorable than ...
- Normal?

226
00:17:42,838 --> 00:17:43,958
Exactly!

227
00:17:44,358 --> 00:17:46,238
No, sorry.

228
00:17:46,638 --> 00:17:49,638
Did Mrs. Solando say anything
during group therapy?

229
00:17:50,718 --> 00:17:52,438
She was worried about the rain.

230
00:17:53,718 --> 00:17:55,238
And she hated the food here.

231
00:17:55,838 --> 00:17:58,838
Complained constantly,
last night included.

232
00:18:00,238 --> 00:18:03,038
So ... you were there,
was there a doctor present?

233
00:18:03,638 --> 00:18:06,238
Yes, Dr Sheehan led the discussion.

234
00:18:07,238 --> 00:18:08,638
Dr Sheehan?

235
00:18:09,638 --> 00:18:12,318
Yes, he was running the session.

236
00:18:13,238 --> 00:18:14,638
He's Rachel's "primary".

237
00:18:14,838 --> 00:18:17,238
The psychaiatrist who directly
oversees her care.

238
00:18:19,638 --> 00:18:21,718
Were gonna need to speak with Dr Sheehan.

239
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:24,238
I'm afraid that won't be possible.

240
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:27,638
He left on the ferry this morning.
His vacation was already planned.

241
00:18:27,678 --> 00:18:29,438
He'd been putting it off too long.

242
00:18:29,518 --> 00:18:31,158
You're in a state of lockdown.

243
00:18:31,838 --> 00:18:34,318
A dangerous patient has escaped,

244
00:18:34,358 --> 00:18:38,038
and you let her primary doctor
leave on vacation?

245
00:18:38,638 --> 00:18:40,438
Of course, he's a doctor.

246
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:48,038
Do you have the phone number for
where he's gone?

247
00:18:48,638 --> 00:18:50,838
Hello? Hello?

248
00:18:52,438 --> 00:18:53,718
Hello?

249
00:18:54,158 --> 00:18:55,758
Anybody there?

250
00:18:56,518 --> 00:18:58,758
I'm sorry sir, but it's all down,
all the lines.

251
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:00,238
The storm's hitting the
mainland like a hammer.

252
00:19:00,438 --> 00:19:04,558
If you get it working come find me immediately.
The marshal's need to make an important call.

253
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:06,238
Yes sir.

254
00:19:12,238 --> 00:19:15,078
I'm afraid I have evening rounds, in the wards.

255
00:19:15,118 --> 00:19:17,958
But I'll be having drinks and a cigar at
my house, around 9.

256
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,638
If you care to drop by.

257
00:19:19,838 --> 00:19:22,438
Good, we can talk then, right?

258
00:19:24,238 --> 00:19:26,038
We have been talking, Marshal.

259
00:19:42,238 --> 00:19:45,438
Gotta say, I'm thinking I got
into the wrong line of public service.

260
00:19:45,478 --> 00:19:48,398
It is a little overwhelming.
It was constructed during the civil war.

261
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:51,358
The same time as the military fort
housing ward C.

262
00:19:59,638 --> 00:20:02,118
This is the original commander's quarters
when uncle sam got the bill.

263
00:20:02,838 --> 00:20:04,438
The commander was courtmartialled.

264
00:20:04,478 --> 00:20:06,038
I can see why.

265
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:08,838
Nice music. who is that? Brahms?

266
00:20:09,838 --> 00:20:10,958
No.

267
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,438
It's Mahler.

268
00:20:20,838 --> 00:20:22,238
Quite right, Marshal.

269
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:25,718
Forgive me, gentlemen,
My colleague, Dr Jeremiah Naehring.

270
00:20:34,238 --> 00:20:37,638
Quartet for Piano and Strings,
in A minor.

271
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:43,438
- Your poison, gentlemen?
- Right, if you've got it.

272
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:45,638
Soda and ice please, thanks.

273
00:20:46,518 --> 00:20:48,358
Oh, you don't indulge in alcohol?

274
00:20:48,838 --> 00:20:50,238
I am surprised.

275
00:20:51,438 --> 00:20:54,838
Isn't it common for men in your
profession to imbibe?.

276
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:58,038
Common enough, and
and yours?

277
00:20:59,638 --> 00:21:03,038
- I'm sorry?
- Your profession, doctor, psychiatry ...

278
00:21:03,558 --> 00:21:06,558
I've always heared it's overrun
with boozers and drunks.

279
00:21:07,238 --> 00:21:08,838
Not that I've noticed.

280
00:21:10,638 --> 00:21:12,438
What's that? Icetea in your glass there?

281
00:21:13,638 --> 00:21:14,958
Excellent Marshal.

282
00:21:15,638 --> 00:21:18,038
You have outstanding defense mechanisms.

283
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:20,958
You must be quite adapt at the interrogations. Humm

284
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:33,438
Men like you ... are my specialty.

285
00:21:33,838 --> 00:21:35,638
Men of violence.

286
00:21:36,038 --> 00:21:38,438
Now that's a hell of assumption to make...

287
00:21:38,518 --> 00:21:42,838
No assumption. Not at all. You misunderstand me,
I said - you are men of violence.

288
00:21:43,518 --> 00:21:47,638
I'm not accusing you of being, violent men,
that's quite different.

289
00:21:47,718 --> 00:21:50,238
Please, please, edify us Doctor.

290
00:21:52,718 --> 00:21:54,438
You both served overseas, huh?

291
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:58,638
Not much of a stretch Doc, for all you know
we were both paper pushers over there.

292
00:21:59,638 --> 00:22:01,638
No, you were not.

293
00:22:16,438 --> 00:22:21,238
Since the schoolyard, neither
of you has ever walked away from a physical conflict.

294
00:22:22,238 --> 00:22:26,718
No, not cause you enjoyed it,
but because retreat isn't something you considered an option.

295
00:22:27,438 --> 00:22:29,158
We weren't raised to run Doc.

296
00:22:30,238 --> 00:22:32,838
Ah, yes... raised,

297
00:22:34,238 --> 00:22:36,438
and who raised you, Marshal?

298
00:22:36,638 --> 00:22:37,638
Me?

299
00:22:39,238 --> 00:22:40,638
Wolves.

300
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:45,838
Ah, ha, very impressive defense mechanisms.

301
00:23:43,238 --> 00:23:45,238
Do you believe in God, Marshal?

302
00:23:50,838 --> 00:23:52,558
No I'm quite serious.

303
00:23:54,718 --> 00:23:56,238
Speaks German

304
00:23:58,238 --> 00:24:01,438
Have you ever um seen ... a death camp, Doctor? (speaks German)

305
00:24:02,758 --> 00:24:05,038
(translation) I have, I was there, at the liberation of Dachau

306
00:24:11,438 --> 00:24:14,638
(Trans) His English is very good, almost flawless.

307
00:24:15,638 --> 00:24:19,558
His english, really is very good.
You hit the consonants a tad hard, though.

308
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:22,438
You're a German?

309
00:24:23,438 --> 00:24:27,638
- Is legal immigration a crime, Marshal?
- Oh I don't know doctor, you tell us.

310
00:24:30,638 --> 00:24:35,238
Now listen, we gonna need those files on Sheehan
and the rest of staff as well.

311
00:24:35,518 --> 00:24:38,038
No personal files will be released to you
Period.

312
00:24:38,358 --> 00:24:41,438
- We gonna need those files.
- Out of the question.

313
00:24:41,478 --> 00:24:44,038
Bullshit, out of the question,
bullshit.

314
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:46,038
Who the hells is in charge here anyway? huh?

315
00:24:46,838 --> 00:24:50,518
Dr Naehring acts as liaison to
our board of overseers.

316
00:24:50,638 --> 00:24:52,638
He relayed your request and it's been refused.

317
00:24:52,718 --> 00:24:55,838
Refused? They don't have the authority to refuse.
And neither do you, sir.

318
00:24:55,958 --> 00:24:59,438
Marshal, continue your investigation
and we will do all we can to help.

319
00:24:59,558 --> 00:25:00,958
This investigation is over.

320
00:25:01,438 --> 00:25:03,238
Were gonna file our reports
and were gonna hand it over to...

321
00:25:03,818 --> 00:25:06,138
- Hoover's boys.
- Hoover's boys, that's right.

322
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:08,338
Were taken the ferry back in the morning.

323
00:25:08,538 --> 00:25:09,738
Come on Chuck.

324
00:25:18,338 --> 00:25:19,938
Nice night.

325
00:25:25,538 --> 00:25:27,538
You'll be bunking in the orderlies quarters.

326
00:25:39,658 --> 00:25:42,658
Hey boss? ... We're really packin it in?

327
00:25:44,018 --> 00:25:45,018
Why?

328
00:25:45,938 --> 00:25:48,858
I guess, I dunno, I just...
never really quit anything before.

329
00:25:50,338 --> 00:25:52,937
We haven't heard the truth once yet Chuck.

330
00:25:53,817 --> 00:25:58,617
Listen, Rachel Solando did not slip out of
a locked cell barefoot without any help.

331
00:25:59,617 --> 00:26:01,457
I think she had alot of help.

332
00:26:01,617 --> 00:26:04,097
Maybe Cawley sitting up in his mansion
right now,

333
00:26:04,137 --> 00:26:06,537
rethinking his whole attitude.

334
00:26:07,737 --> 00:26:10,057
- Maybe in the morning...
- You're bluffing?

335
00:26:11,457 --> 00:26:13,137
I didn't say that.

336
00:26:31,137 --> 00:26:33,137
I found a whole stock of these, Teddy.

337
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:36,337
Jesus, are you ever sober anymore?

338
00:26:37,017 --> 00:26:39,737
I killed alot of people in the war.

339
00:26:41,657 --> 00:26:43,337
Is that why you drink?

340
00:26:46,217 --> 00:26:48,017
Are you real?

341
00:26:48,537 --> 00:26:49,537
No.

342
00:26:53,817 --> 00:26:55,137
She's still here.

343
00:26:55,937 --> 00:26:56,937
Who?

344
00:26:58,137 --> 00:26:59,617
Rachel?

345
00:27:01,137 --> 00:27:02,537
She never left.

346
00:27:15,537 --> 00:27:18,457
Remember when we stayed in the cabin
in the summer Teddy?

347
00:27:19,937 --> 00:27:21,737
We were so happy.

348
00:27:23,737 --> 00:27:25,137
She's here.

349
00:27:25,337 --> 00:27:27,137
You can't leave.

350
00:27:39,337 --> 00:27:41,137
I'm not gonna leave.

351
00:27:42,657 --> 00:27:44,657
I love you so much.

352
00:27:48,737 --> 00:27:51,737
- I'm just bones in a box, Teddy.
- No.

353
00:27:53,537 --> 00:27:54,937
I am.

354
00:27:57,937 --> 00:27:59,617
You have to wake up.

355
00:28:01,057 --> 00:28:02,937
I won't go.

356
00:28:03,537 --> 00:28:05,537
You're here.

357
00:28:06,937 --> 00:28:08,537
I'm not.

358
00:28:09,217 --> 00:28:11,457
You have to face that.

359
00:28:13,737 --> 00:28:14,937
But she is,

360
00:28:17,057 --> 00:28:18,537
and so is he.

361
00:28:20,737 --> 00:28:21,937
Who?

362
00:28:23,937 --> 00:28:25,657
Laeddis.

363
00:28:29,937 --> 00:28:31,337
I have to go.

364
00:28:34,857 --> 00:28:36,737
No, no please...please, let me hold onto you.

365
00:28:37,217 --> 00:28:39,217
- Just a little bit longer please.
- Oh, Teddy ...you have to.

366
00:28:39,657 --> 00:28:41,657
Let me go.

367
00:28:42,937 --> 00:28:44,337
I can't.

368
00:29:15,217 --> 00:29:16,937
Ain't gonna be no ferry in this shit.

369
00:29:21,457 --> 00:29:22,537
Doctor.

370
00:29:23,137 --> 00:29:24,137
Doctor, Doctor.

371
00:29:25,217 --> 00:29:28,017
We need to interview the patients who
were in Rachel's group therapy session.

372
00:29:28,217 --> 00:29:29,937
I thought your investigation was finished?

373
00:29:30,017 --> 00:29:32,137
It's not like we can take the ferry.

374
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:35,937
And now was Rachel recieving any
other treatment for her illnesses?

375
00:29:37,337 --> 00:29:40,457
Do you know the state of
mental health field these days, gentlemen?

376
00:29:40,657 --> 00:29:42,737
No, not a clue doctor.

377
00:29:42,937 --> 00:29:44,137
War.

378
00:29:44,217 --> 00:29:46,737
The old school believes in
surgical intervention.

379
00:29:47,017 --> 00:29:51,137
Psychosurgery.
Procedures like the transorbital lobotomy.

380
00:29:52,737 --> 00:29:57,457
Some say that the patients become reasonable,
docile, others say they become zombies.

381
00:29:58,017 --> 00:30:00,137
- And the new school?
- Psycho-pharmacology.

382
00:30:00,337 --> 00:30:02,337
A new drug has just been approved-
Proflorazine.

383
00:30:02,457 --> 00:30:04,057
That relaxes psychotic patients.

384
00:30:04,057 --> 00:30:05,497
You could say tames them.

385
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:07,617
- And which school are you, Doc?
- Me?

386
00:30:08,137 --> 00:30:11,337
I have this radical idea that if you treat a
patient with respect,

387
00:30:11,377 --> 00:30:12,737
listen to him.

388
00:30:13,337 --> 00:30:15,657
Try and understand,
you just might reach him.

389
00:30:21,457 --> 00:30:23,897
- These patients?
- Even these.

390
00:30:23,937 --> 00:30:26,457
What should be a last resort,
is becoming a first response.

391
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:28,937
Give them a pill and put them in a corner,
and it all goes away.

392
00:30:30,137 --> 00:30:32,617
Rachel Solando was a on a combination of drugs,

393
00:30:32,657 --> 00:30:36,337
meant to keep her from becoming violent
and it was only intermittently effective.

394
00:30:37,337 --> 00:30:41,137
The greatest obstacle to her recovery was
her refusal to face what she had done.

395
00:30:42,137 --> 00:30:43,137
"Was"

396
00:30:44,137 --> 00:30:48,537
Is there a reason you keep referring to
your patient in the past tense, Doctor?

397
00:30:51,037 --> 00:30:52,637
Look outside, Marshal.

398
00:30:53,837 --> 00:30:55,357
Why do you think?

399
00:31:01,117 --> 00:31:04,837
Next up is Peter Breene. Assaulted
his father's nurse with broken glass.

400
00:31:04,877 --> 00:31:07,757
Nurse survived, but
her face was permanently disfigured.

401
00:31:08,437 --> 00:31:09,837
Can't wait.

402
00:31:09,957 --> 00:31:12,637
She'd smile at me.
She's so sweet.

403
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:17,237
But ... you could see it in her eyes,
she liked to be naked.

404
00:31:17,837 --> 00:31:19,437
To...to suck cock.

405
00:31:20,557 --> 00:31:22,037
Ok Mr Breene.

406
00:31:22,717 --> 00:31:25,517
And then she asked me if she can have
a glass of water.

407
00:31:26,157 --> 00:31:28,837
Alone in the kitchen?
Like that's no big deal?

408
00:31:29,717 --> 00:31:32,837
- Why was that a big deal?
-  It was obvious.

409
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:37,357
She wanted me to pull out my thing so she
could laugh at it.

410
00:31:38,717 --> 00:31:40,357
Mr Breene,

411
00:31:41,957 --> 00:31:44,157
we need to ask you some questions, ok?

412
00:31:46,637 --> 00:31:48,237
When I cut her she screamed.

413
00:31:50,517 --> 00:31:51,637
But ...

414
00:31:52,237 --> 00:31:53,837
She scared me.

415
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,437
What did she expect?

416
00:31:56,237 --> 00:31:57,757
Interesting.

417
00:31:58,437 --> 00:32:01,757
But we are here to talk
Rachel Solando, OK?

418
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:03,037
Rachel Solando ...

419
00:32:03,957 --> 00:32:06,037
Did you know she drowned her own kids?

420
00:32:06,117 --> 00:32:08,037
She drowned her kids.

421
00:32:08,317 --> 00:32:11,317
This is, this a sick fucking world
we live in. I'll tell you that ...

422
00:32:11,437 --> 00:32:12,837
They should be gassed,

423
00:32:12,957 --> 00:32:16,397
all of them... the retards, the killers,

424
00:32:16,437 --> 00:32:19,837
the niggers,  you kill your own kid-
gas the bitch.

425
00:32:22,837 --> 00:32:24,837
Could you.. stop that?

426
00:32:26,237 --> 00:32:28,517
- That nurse?
- Please. Stop that.

427
00:32:28,637 --> 00:32:30,837
That nurse, that nurse maybe,
maybe she had kids, huh?

428
00:32:32,957 --> 00:32:34,037
A husband,

429
00:32:35,957 --> 00:32:38,357
just trying to make ends meet,

430
00:32:39,437 --> 00:32:41,637
to have a normal life ...

431
00:32:42,437 --> 00:32:44,837
and it says in your file, that

432
00:32:44,957 --> 00:32:48,037
you tore her face off, didn't you?

433
00:32:49,637 --> 00:32:53,037
Congratulations, no more normal
for her, not ever again, no.

434
00:32:55,157 --> 00:32:57,837
Do you know what she was afraid of?

435
00:33:00,237 --> 00:33:01,197
You.

436
00:33:01,237 --> 00:33:03,557
Could you stop that, please?

437
00:33:05,117 --> 00:33:06,837
Stop that!

438
00:33:07,437 --> 00:33:09,197
Please ... stop!

439
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:11,837
- You know a patient by the name Andrew Laeddis?
- No! No!

440
00:33:14,437 --> 00:33:15,837
I want to go back.

441
00:33:32,637 --> 00:33:34,437
Well I'll never get out of here.

442
00:33:34,517 --> 00:33:36,237
I'm not sure that I should.

443
00:33:37,837 --> 00:33:39,237
Excuse me for saying this.

444
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,037
- Miss Kearns 
- Mrs

445
00:33:41,517 --> 00:33:42,957
Mrs Kearns.

446
00:33:44,437 --> 00:33:45,637
But you seem,  

447
00:33:46,437 --> 00:33:47,717
quite quite normal, 

448
00:33:48,157 --> 00:33:50,237
I mean compared
with the other patients here.

449
00:33:50,517 --> 00:33:54,157
Well, I have my dark days,
I suppose everybody does.

450
00:33:55,157 --> 00:33:58,357
The difference is that most people don't kill
their husbands with an axe.

451
00:34:00,557 --> 00:34:03,637
Although personally I think if a
man beats you and fucks

452
00:34:04,117 --> 00:34:07,557
half the women he sees
and no one will help you,

453
00:34:08,637 --> 00:34:11,837
axing him isn't the least understandable
thing you could do.

454
00:34:13,557 --> 00:34:15,037
Maybe you shouldn't get out.

455
00:34:16,557 --> 00:34:18,237
And what would I do if I did?

456
00:34:18,717 --> 00:34:22,037
I don't know the world anymore
They say there are

457
00:34:22,157 --> 00:34:24,717
bombs that can reduce whole
cities to ash

458
00:34:25,237 --> 00:34:27,817
And ah, what do they call "televisions",

459
00:34:28,237 --> 00:34:30,717
voices and faces coming from a box.

460
00:34:31,517 --> 00:34:33,717
I hear enough voices already.

461
00:34:34,437 --> 00:34:36,437
What can you tell us about Rachel?

462
00:34:39,437 --> 00:34:42,437
Umm not much, she... she keeps to herself.

463
00:34:43,837 --> 00:34:45,637
She believed her kids were alive.

464
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:51,357
She thought she was still living
in the Berkshires and we were all her neighbours,

465
00:34:52,037 --> 00:34:55,037
- the, the, the milkmen, postmen.
- Deliverymen

466
00:34:56,357 --> 00:34:58,117
And Dr Sheehan was there that night?

467
00:34:58,517 --> 00:35:00,037
Yes, um,

468
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:02,117
he talked about anger.

469
00:35:04,637 --> 00:35:05,837
Tell me about him.

470
00:35:06,957 --> 00:35:08,317
What's he like?

471
00:35:09,957 --> 00:35:11,937
He is a . ..

472
00:35:13,957 --> 00:35:16,437
Ok... nice.

473
00:35:16,957 --> 00:35:19,037
Not hard on the eyes as my mother would say

474
00:35:21,717 --> 00:35:23,437
Did he ever make a pass at you?

475
00:35:24,437 --> 00:35:25,437
No

476
00:35:26,437 --> 00:35:29,037
No, Dr. Sheehan is a good doctor, he wouldn't ...

477
00:35:32,637 --> 00:35:34,437
Um, could I, could I have a glass of water, please?

478
00:35:34,637 --> 00:35:36,157
No problem.

479
00:35:51,237 --> 00:35:52,637
Thank you, Marshal.

480
00:35:56,637 --> 00:35:59,757
I have just one more question for you
Mrs Kearns.

481
00:36:03,117 --> 00:36:06,117
Did you ever meet a patient
named Andrew Laeddis?

482
00:36:08,637 --> 00:36:09,637
No.

483
00:36:11,237 --> 00:36:13,237
Never heard of him.

484
00:36:18,557 --> 00:36:20,037
She was coached.

485
00:36:20,717 --> 00:36:23,237
She used practically the same words as
Cawley and the nurse.

486
00:36:23,277 --> 00:36:26,357
- It's like she'd been told exactly what to say.
- Who's Andrew Laeddis?

487
00:36:30,437 --> 00:36:34,357
You asked every one of those patients back there
about him. Who is he?

488
00:36:38,157 --> 00:36:41,437
What the hell, boss, I'm your partner
for the Christ's sake!

489
00:36:41,837 --> 00:36:43,237
We just met, Chuck.

490
00:36:44,037 --> 00:36:45,997
Been on the beat for a long time.

491
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:49,037
You got a duty, you got a career
and what I'm doing,

492
00:36:49,637 --> 00:36:51,837
it's not exactly by the book.

493
00:36:53,117 --> 00:36:58,537
I don't, I don't give a damn about by the book, boss
I just what to know what the hell is going on.

494
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:05,037
When this case came over the wires,

495
00:37:06,117 --> 00:37:10,717
- I requested it, specifically, do you understand?
- Why?

496
00:37:12,317 --> 00:37:14,037
Andrew Laeddis,

497
00:37:14,837 --> 00:37:19,357
was the maintenance man in the apartment
building where my wife and I lived.

498
00:37:20,437 --> 00:37:21,637
Ok.

499
00:37:23,237 --> 00:37:25,837
He was also a firebug.

500
00:37:27,837 --> 00:37:29,517
Andrew Laeddis lit the match,

501
00:37:32,957 --> 00:37:36,437
that caused the fire that killed my wife.

502
00:37:43,517 --> 00:37:44,957
Let em out.

503
00:37:47,637 --> 00:37:49,157
What happened to Laeddis?

504
00:37:49,637 --> 00:37:52,757
Got away with it. Laeddis got away it 
and then he disappeared.

505
00:37:53,957 --> 00:37:55,957
About a year ago I opened up the
paper and there he is.

506
00:37:56,157 --> 00:37:57,637
Ugly looking son of a bitch.

507
00:37:58,237 --> 00:38:00,637
Huge scar from his right temple
down to his left lip.

508
00:38:00,757 --> 00:38:03,957
Eyes different colours,
not the type of face you'd forget.

509
00:38:04,037 --> 00:38:06,957
He'd burned down a schoolhouse,
killed 2 people.

510
00:38:07,117 --> 00:38:08,837
He said voices told him to do it.

511
00:38:08,957 --> 00:38:11,437
First he went to prison
and then he got transferred here.

512
00:38:11,557 --> 00:38:13,556
- Then what?
- Then nothing.

513
00:38:13,636 --> 00:38:17,036
He vanished like he never existed,
no record whatsoever.

514
00:38:17,436 --> 00:38:19,956
Pretty sure he's not in ward B,
that leaves ward C.

515
00:38:19,956 --> 00:38:21,116
Or he could be dead.

516
00:38:21,156 --> 00:38:25,636
So could Rachel Solando for that matter.
Lot of places to hide a body here.

517
00:38:27,036 --> 00:38:29,436
Only one place 
no one would really notice.

518
00:38:40,836 --> 00:38:44,636
That patient, Bridget Kearne,
when she sent me for water,

519
00:38:44,716 --> 00:38:47,036
she said something to you back there, didn't she?

520
00:38:47,636 --> 00:38:48,636
No.

521
00:38:50,716 --> 00:38:52,036
Come on boss!

522
00:38:55,436 --> 00:38:56,836
She wrote it.

523
00:39:00,236 --> 00:39:02,636


524
00:39:11,636 --> 00:39:12,716
Boss!

525
00:39:13,316 --> 00:39:16,836
We gotta get in there, it's turning
into fucking Kansas out here.

526
00:39:16,876 --> 00:39:18,836
All right. Now
Let's go!

527
00:39:22,636 --> 00:39:23,636
Watch out!

528
00:39:26,236 --> 00:39:26,936
Jesus!

529
00:39:28,236 --> 00:39:30,236
Come on! Go there.

530
00:39:48,156 --> 00:39:51,436
- God.
- Jesus Christ,........ dammit.

531
00:39:59,756 --> 00:40:02,636
- Are you okay boss?
- Yeh. that's all right.

532
00:40:010,236 --> 00:40:10,936
So if Laeddis is here,

533
00:40:12,556 --> 00:40:14,836
What are you going to about it?

534
00:40:16,236 --> 00:40:18,836
I'm not here to kill Leaddis.

535
00:40:26,036 --> 00:40:29,436
If it were my wife
I'd kill him...twice.

536
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:43,636
When we got through the gates of Dachau,
the SS guards surrendered.

537
00:40:51,636 --> 00:40:55,036
The Commandant tried to kill himself
before we got there,

538
00:40:58,236 --> 00:40:59,956
but he..he botched it.

539
00:41:00,956 --> 00:41:02,836
Took him an hour to die.

540
00:41:07,436 --> 00:41:12,236
When I went outside
I saw all the bodies on the ground.

541
00:41:15,436 --> 00:41:17,156
Too many to count.

542
00:41:42,836 --> 00:41:44,516
Too many to imagine.

543
00:41:47,236 --> 00:41:48,356
So yeah, then

544
00:41:50,836 --> 00:41:54,036
the guards surrendered, we took
their guns and we lined them up.

545
00:42:36,956 --> 00:42:38,636
It wasn't warfare it was, .....

546
00:42:40,836 --> 00:42:42,156
it was murder.

547
00:42:46,356 --> 00:42:48,436
I've had enough of killing.

548
00:42:51,036 --> 00:42:52,636
That's not why I'm here.

549
00:42:53,836 --> 00:42:55,156
So what is this all about?

550
00:42:58,036 --> 00:42:59,516
After Laeddis vanished,

551
00:43:00,956 --> 00:43:03,636
I started doing some checking
on Ashecliff,

552
00:43:04,956 --> 00:43:09,036
lot of people know about this place, but no
one wants to talk, you know, it's like,

553
00:43:09,836 --> 00:43:11,636
it's like they're scared of something.

554
00:43:13,556 --> 00:43:16,236
You know this place is funded by a
special grant,

555
00:43:17,236 --> 00:43:19,836
from the House on
American Activities Committee.

556
00:43:20,316 --> 00:43:25,036
HOUAC? And how exactly are we fighting
the commies from an island in Boston Harbor?

557
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:28,956
By conducting experiments on the mind.

558
00:43:30,036 --> 00:43:31,236
At least that's my guess.

559
00:43:31,516 --> 00:43:33,356
And you think thats going on here?

560
00:43:33,436 --> 00:43:35,596
Like I said, no one would talk, right?


561
00:43:35,636 --> 00:43:38,236
Until I found somebody
who used to be a patient here.

562
00:43:38,356 --> 00:43:40,036
The guy's name is George Noyce.

563
00:43:40,156 --> 00:43:42,636
Nice college kid,
socialist.

564
00:43:42,716 --> 00:43:45,836
He got offerred some money for some psych study. 
Guess what they were testing?

565
00:43:46,236 --> 00:43:49,356
- Toothpaste
- So he starts seeing dragons everywhere.

566
00:43:49,436 --> 00:43:53,116
He almost beats his professor to death,
ends up here in Ashecliff.

567
00:43:53,236 --> 00:43:54,836
Ward C.

568
00:43:55,156 --> 00:43:58,396
They release him after 1 year, right?
What does he do?

569
00:43:58,436 --> 00:44:03,236
Two weeks on the mainland
he walks into a bar,... stabs three men to death.

570
00:44:03,756 --> 00:44:06,316
His lawyer pleads insanity
but Noyce ...Noyce he

571
00:44:06,756 --> 00:44:08,316
stands up in the courtroom and

572
00:44:08,836 --> 00:44:10,556
he he begs the judge,
for the electric chair.

573
00:44:10,636 --> 00:44:12,836
Anywhere but a
mental hospital.

574
00:44:13,436 --> 00:44:15,836
Judge gives him life in Dedham Prison.

575
00:44:17,036 --> 00:44:19,036
- And you found him?
- Yeh, I've found him.

576
00:44:21,036 --> 00:44:22,236
Well,  ...  he's... he's a mess.

577
00:44:23,156 --> 00:44:25,516
- But it is pretty clear from what he tells me.
- What?

578
00:44:26,836 --> 00:44:29,156
They're experimenting on people here.

579
00:44:29,716 --> 00:44:31,156
I don't know boss.

580
00:44:32,236 --> 00:44:35,156
- How do you believe a crazy guy.
- That's the beauty of it.

581
00:44:35,716 --> 00:44:39,436
Crazy people are a perfect subject.
they talk, but nobody listens.

582
00:44:40,236 --> 00:44:41,636
I stood in Dachau.

583
00:44:41,956 --> 00:44:45,836
We saw what human beings are capable
of doing to each other, right?

584
00:44:46,716 --> 00:44:49,076
For Christ sake we fought a goddam war

585
00:44:49,116 --> 00:44:51,436
to stop them,
and now I find out it may be happening here...

586
00:44:51,476 --> 00:44:53,636
On our soil,
No

587
00:44:55,236 --> 00:44:57,036
So what are you really here to do, Ted?

588
00:44:58,116 --> 00:45:00,036
I'm going to get the proof.

589
00:45:00,556 --> 00:45:03,836
I'm gonna go back and I'm gonna blow
the lid off this place.

590
00:45:04,636 --> 00:45:05,836
That's it.

591
00:45:06,556 --> 00:45:07,956
Wait a minute.

592
00:45:09,036 --> 00:45:11,036
You started asking around about Ashecliff.

593
00:45:11,636 --> 00:45:14,956
Waiting for a chance to get out here
then suddenly they need a US marshal?

594
00:45:16,716 --> 00:45:19,436
I got lucky, there was a patient escape 
it was the perfect excuse.

595
00:45:19,476 --> 00:45:21,556
No, no, no boss
Luck doesn't work that way.

596
00:45:22,436 --> 00:45:26,836
The world doesn't work that way.
They got electrified fence around a septic facility.

597
00:45:26,956 --> 00:45:29,956
Ward C is inside a Civil War fort?

598
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:34,356
A chief of staff with ties to the OSS
Funding from HOUAC?

599
00:45:34,436 --> 00:45:38,236
I mean Jesus Christ! Everything about this place
stinks of  government arse.

600
00:45:38,436 --> 00:45:40,356
- What If they wanted you here?
- Bullshit.

601
00:45:40,436 --> 00:45:42,156
- You were asking questions.
- Bullshit.

602
00:45:42,236 --> 00:45:46,436
Bullshit, we came here for Rachel Solando?
Where..where is one shred of evidence that she even existed?

603
00:45:47,356 --> 00:45:49,676
There is no way they could have known
I would be assigned to this case, there's no way.

604
00:45:49,716 --> 00:45:52,036
What if you were looking into them and 
they were looking into you.

605
00:45:52,636 --> 00:45:55,156
All they had to do
is a fake an escape to get you here.

606
00:45:55,156 --> 00:45:57,836
And now they have you and now.
they have us both, here, now.

607
00:46:01,756 --> 00:46:03,436
Marshal, are you over here?

608
00:46:04,116 --> 00:46:06,036
This is Deputy Warden McPherson.

609
00:46:06,956 --> 00:46:08,036
Marshal!

610
00:46:08,116 --> 00:46:10,036
How about that They found us huh?

611
00:46:10,316 --> 00:46:12,436
It's an island boss There always gonna find us.

612
00:46:13,836 --> 00:46:15,436
I know you're in there.

613
00:46:16,716 --> 00:46:18,956
Were gettin off of this godddam island,
you and me.

614
00:46:19,556 --> 00:46:20,636
Come on!

615
00:46:24,316 --> 00:46:26,236
- Come on!
- Go!

616
00:46:35,516 --> 00:46:38,436
Get dryed off,
Dr Cawley wants to talk to you. Now!

617
00:46:39,156 --> 00:46:42,436
And hurry up, this thing is turning into
to a goddam hurricane.

618
00:46:47,436 --> 00:46:49,036
I dropped those suits off to be cleaned.

619
00:46:49,716 --> 00:46:51,236
It should be ready by tomorrow.

620
00:46:51,636 --> 00:46:53,716
That is if we all haven't washed away first.

621
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:58,236
Speaking of which, well I'm afraid your... a smokes were
pretty much done for.

622
00:46:59,036 --> 00:46:59,956
So ...

623
00:47:01,956 --> 00:47:03,836
It's our only choice, huh?

624
00:47:03,956 --> 00:47:06,956
I have something really nice in prison grey,
that don't work for you?

625
00:47:07,036 --> 00:47:09,556
Now that you mention it, these are just fine.

626
00:47:10,636 --> 00:47:13,636
That's why I must repeat my insistence
that all ward C patients

627
00:47:13,676 --> 00:47:15,316
be placed in manual restraints.

628
00:47:15,836 --> 00:47:19,036
If the facility floods, they'll drown,
you know that.

629
00:47:19,636 --> 00:47:21,636
- That would take a lot of flooding.
- We are on an island,

630
00:47:21,676 --> 00:47:23,396
in the middle of the ocean,
during a hurricane,

631
00:47:23,436 --> 00:47:25,836
a lot of flooding seems like a
distinct possibility.

632
00:47:25,876 --> 00:47:28,436
It's a gamble Steven,
say the power fails

633
00:47:28,476 --> 00:47:29,596
There's a backup generator.

634
00:47:29,636 --> 00:47:32,436
And if that goes? The cell doors
will open.

635
00:47:33,636 --> 00:47:35,436
Where are they going to go?

636
00:47:36,156 --> 00:47:38,956
They can't just hop a ferry, scoot over
to the mainland and wreak havoc.

637
00:47:39,036 --> 00:47:43,036
You're quite right. There far more 
likely to wreak havoc right here on us.

638
00:47:43,636 --> 00:47:45,716
If they're manacled to the floor, they'll die.

639
00:47:47,156 --> 00:47:48,356
24 human beings.

640
00:47:49,236 --> 00:47:50,996
And you can live with that, can you?

641
00:47:51,036 --> 00:47:52,796
Frankly, if it were up to me,

642
00:47:52,836 --> 00:47:56,156
I'd put all 42 in ward A and B in
manual restraints as well.

643
00:47:56,236 --> 00:47:57,836
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

644
00:47:58,236 --> 00:48:01,556
- Marshal.
- I'm sorry doctor, I just have one quick question.

645
00:48:01,556 --> 00:48:02,756
Yes, I will be with you in a moment.

646
00:48:02,836 --> 00:48:05,556
We spoke this morning about Rachel Solando's note,

647
00:48:05,636 --> 00:48:07,236
The law of 4, I loved that.

648
00:48:07,436 --> 00:48:11,156
You said you had no idea what
that second line could refer to, correct?

649
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:13,236
Who is 67?

650
00:48:13,716 --> 00:48:16,536
Yes, I'm afraid I still don't,
None of us do.
- Ah huh,

651
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:18,956
nothing comes to mind.

652
00:48:21,156 --> 00:48:22,436
Nothing?

653
00:48:26,156 --> 00:48:28,636
Because I believed I just heard
you say that there are

654
00:48:28,676 --> 00:48:31,156
24 patients in ward C

655
00:48:31,196 --> 00:48:33,596
and 42 patients in wards A and B.

656
00:48:33,636 --> 00:48:37,516
Which means there's a total of what,
66 patients at this facility.

657
00:48:39,036 --> 00:48:40,936
That is correct, yes.

658
00:48:42,716 --> 00:48:44,956
So it seems that 
Rachel Solando was suggesting

659
00:48:45,436 --> 00:48:49,156
that you have a 67th patient doctor.

660
00:48:50,156 --> 00:48:53,036
- But I'm afraid we don't.
- This is ridiculous.

661
00:48:53,116 --> 00:48:56,156
- What are you doing here?
- We are doing our goddam job.

662
00:48:56,636 --> 00:48:59,116
Didn't McPherson tell you the good news?

663
00:48:59,956 --> 00:49:01,636
No, what's the good news, doctor?

664
00:49:02,316 --> 00:49:04,316
Rachel's been found.

665
00:49:05,116 --> 00:49:06,636
She's here.

666
00:49:07,556 --> 00:49:09,156
Safe and sound.

667
00:49:20,036 --> 00:49:21,836
There's not a mark on her.

668
00:49:25,516 --> 00:49:27,156
Who are these men?

669
00:49:30,036 --> 00:49:31,836
Why are they in my house?

670
00:49:32,036 --> 00:49:34,036
Police officers Rachel.

671
00:49:34,436 --> 00:49:36,716
They ... have a few questions.

672
00:49:39,036 --> 00:49:40,356
Ma'am.

673
00:49:43,956 --> 00:49:45,956
There has been a sighting of a known
communist,

674
00:49:47,156 --> 00:49:50,356
subversive in this area
passing out literature.

675
00:49:51,956 --> 00:49:53,236
Here?

676
00:49:55,236 --> 00:49:57,036
In this neighbourhood?

677
00:49:57,116 --> 00:49:58,936
Yes, I'm afraid so.

678
00:50:00,036 --> 00:50:03,036
Now if you could tell us what you did yesterday, 
where you were,


679
00:50:03,636 --> 00:50:05,836
it would really help us narrow down our search.

680
00:50:06,956 --> 00:50:08,236
Yes.

681
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:12,956
Well, I ...

682
00:50:15,156 --> 00:50:17,836
I made breakfast for Jim
and the children,

683
00:50:19,236 --> 00:50:20,436
and then I ...

684
00:50:22,636 --> 00:50:25,236
packed Jim's lunch
and he left.

685
00:50:28,156 --> 00:50:30,436
Then I sent the children off to school.

686
00:50:35,035 --> 00:50:36,355
And then ...

687
00:50:42,735 --> 00:50:46,135
I decided to take a long swim in the lake.

688
00:50:52,035 --> 00:50:53,315
I see.

689
00:50:56,955 --> 00:50:58,435
And after that?

690
00:51:06,035 --> 00:51:07,435
After that...

691
00:51:16,435 --> 00:51:18,035
I thought of you.

692
00:51:23,935 --> 00:51:25,035
I ... I'm sorry ma'am,

693
00:51:25,515 --> 00:51:27,835
I..I don't know what you're talking about.

694
00:51:30,835 --> 00:51:33,835
Don't you know how lonely I've been Jim?

695
00:51:39,435 --> 00:51:40,935
You're gone.

696
00:51:44,355 --> 00:51:45,835
You're dead.

697
00:51:50,435 --> 00:51:52,635
I cry everyday.

698
00:51:58,035 --> 00:52:00,855
How am I supposed to survive?

699
00:52:01,635 --> 00:52:02,835
God.

700
00:52:13,155 --> 00:52:16,435
Rachel ... it'll be all right.

701
00:52:19,235 --> 00:52:21,035
I'm so sorry but ...

702
00:52:22,555 --> 00:52:25,355
Everything will be all right? Okay?

703
00:52:27,235 --> 00:52:28,635
I buried you.

704
00:52:30,635 --> 00:52:35,355
I buried an empty casket. Your body
rained down lots of flesh, splashing into the sea.

705
00:52:35,435 --> 00:52:37,435
Eaten by sharks.

706
00:52:40,835 --> 00:52:43,435
My Jim's dead,
so who the fuck are you?

707
00:52:46,635 --> 00:52:48,235
Who the fuck are you?

708
00:52:49,155 --> 00:52:51,635
Who are you? Who are you?

709
00:53:01,035 --> 00:53:02,635
I'm sorry about that.

710
00:53:02,755 --> 00:53:05,955
I didn't want to interrupt, I thought
she might tell you something, but ...

711
00:53:06,035 --> 00:53:08,035
we found her down by the lighthouse,

712
00:53:08,075 --> 00:53:10,035
skipping stones.

713
00:53:10,835 --> 00:53:14,915
We've no idea how she got out there.
I'm going to have to ask you to go down into the basement.

714
00:53:14,935 --> 00:53:17,955
There's food, water, and cots 
It's the safest place to be-

715
00:53:18,835 --> 00:53:20,635
when the hurricane hits.

716
00:53:23,955 --> 00:53:25,455
Are you all right?
You look pale.

717
00:53:25,955 --> 00:53:27,715
I'm fine, it's just a...

718
00:53:29,035 --> 00:53:30,985
Boss, are you okay?

719
00:53:31,715 --> 00:53:33,955
It's so goddam bright? isn't it?

720
00:53:34,035 --> 00:53:38,155
Photo-sensitivity, headache sometimes?
Marshal, are you having a migraine?

721
00:53:38,515 --> 00:53:39,715
I'll be allright.

722
00:53:47,035 --> 00:53:50,835
What's wrong with him?
- Take these, Marshal. Couple
of hours, you'll be as clear as a bell.

723
00:53:50,875 --> 00:53:53,195
What's wrong with him? 
- He's having a migraine.
Imagine someone sawed open your head and

724
00:53:53,235 --> 00:53:55,235
filled it with razors then shook it
as hard as they could.

725
00:53:55,275 --> 00:53:56,635
Take these pills, Marshal.

726
00:53:56,755 --> 00:54:00,115
- I...I don't  want.
- It'll stop the pain. Take the pills.

727
00:54:04,955 --> 00:54:06,835
He's going to need to lie down.

728
00:54:28,035 --> 00:54:29,515
- Careful.
- Allright.

729
00:54:31,155 --> 00:54:33,635
Gonna be ok, relax.

730
00:54:39,635 --> 00:54:41,835
- Who is that?
- Him?

731
00:54:42,435 --> 00:54:44,235
That's the Warden.

732
00:54:46,035 --> 00:54:48,715
Don't you worry about him, allright?

733
00:54:54,315 --> 00:54:57,435
Looks like an ex-military prick.

734
00:54:57,635 --> 00:55:00,635
You know what, 
I aint even gonna argue with you on that one.

735
00:56:21,955 --> 00:56:24,635
You should have saved me.

736
00:56:26,455 --> 00:56:29,935
You should have saved all of us.

737
00:56:57,035 --> 00:56:59,615
Hey buddy, ......... hey.

738
00:57:01,315 --> 00:57:02,755
Laeddis.

739
00:57:05,035 --> 00:57:06,435
Yes.

740
00:57:15,835 --> 00:57:17,235
Hi, buddy.

741
00:57:18,155 --> 00:57:20,835
No hard feelings, right?

742
00:57:26,935 --> 00:57:29,935
No hard feelings.

743
00:57:41,035 --> 00:57:42,835
A little something for later.

744
00:57:46,635 --> 00:57:49,855
Cause I know how much you need it.

745
00:57:54,635 --> 00:57:56,515
Clock's ticking my friend.

746
00:57:57,355 --> 00:57:59,115
Were running out of time.

747
00:58:09,415 --> 00:58:11,435
Give me a hand here.

748
00:58:32,235 --> 00:58:34,035
I could get into trouble.

749
00:59:00,835 --> 00:59:02,035
Am I dead?

750
00:59:05,835 --> 00:59:06,935
I'm so sorry.

751
00:59:07,935 --> 00:59:10,835
Why didn't you save me?

752
00:59:11,155 --> 00:59:14,835
I tried, I wanted to
but by the time I got there,

753
00:59:15,035 --> 00:59:17,435
it was too late.

754
00:59:37,435 --> 00:59:38,635
See?

755
00:59:41,715 --> 00:59:43,235
Aren't they beautiful?

756
01:00:36,715 --> 01:00:38,855
Why are you all wet.....baby?

757
01:00:41,235 --> 01:00:42,635
Laeddis isn't dead.

758
01:00:44,235 --> 01:00:45,515
He isn't gone.

759
01:00:47,035 --> 01:00:48,515
He's still here.

760
01:00:50,635 --> 01:00:51,835
I know.

761
01:00:52,235 --> 01:00:53,935
You need to find him Teddy.

762
01:00:54,555 --> 01:00:57,635
You need to find him and you kill him dead.

763
01:01:13,155 --> 01:01:14,235
It's ok.

764
01:01:26,235 --> 01:01:27,195
Ward A 
I got it

765
01:01:27,235 --> 01:01:28,835
The generator rooms' flooded.

766
01:01:33,855 --> 01:01:35,335
Are you okay boss?

767
01:01:37,655 --> 01:01:39,335
That goddam migraine.

768
01:01:39,535 --> 01:01:44,135
Back up generators' failed,
whole place is gone crazy.

769
01:01:44,935 --> 01:01:46,455
What do you want to do?

770
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:53,335
Christ!

771
01:01:53,615 --> 01:01:56,335
No no no
Put it down.

772
01:01:56,455 --> 01:01:57,735
Now.
Put it down.

773
01:02:07,815 --> 01:02:10,455
Do you think the whole electrical system is fried?

774
01:02:10,455 --> 01:02:12,935
I'd say it's is a good possibility.

775
01:02:13,455 --> 01:02:15,335
All the electronic security ...

776
01:02:15,375 --> 01:02:18,055
The fences, the gates, the doors.

777
01:02:18,135 --> 01:02:19,215


778
01:02:19,215 --> 01:02:21,535
Nice day for a stroll
don't you think?

779
01:02:21,575 --> 01:02:23,455
To ward C for example.

780
01:02:26,535 --> 01:02:28,535
Maybe well run into Andrew Leaddis.

781
01:02:33,455 --> 01:02:36,135
The guy I told you about, George Noyce?

782
01:02:36,215 --> 01:02:38,935
He told me this is where they keep
the worst ones.

783
01:02:38,975 --> 01:02:41,015
The guys even the other inmates
are scared of.

784
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:45,655
Did Noyce give you anything on the layout?

785
01:02:45,655 --> 01:02:46,855
Not really.

786
01:02:46,935 --> 01:02:50,654
All he remembered was people
screamin day and night, no windows,

787
01:02:50,654 --> 01:02:51,934
and iron bars everywhere.

788
01:03:12,534 --> 01:03:14,054
Jesus Christ!

789
01:03:14,734 --> 01:03:17,654
First time
on Ward C huh?

790
01:03:17,654 --> 01:03:19,214
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

791
01:03:19,334 --> 01:03:23,334
- Yeah we heard stories, but ...
-  Trust me, son you haven't heard shit.

792
01:03:23,374 --> 01:03:25,734
We got most of the bugsies locked down now.

793
01:03:25,774 --> 01:03:27,694
But some of them are still loose.

794
01:03:27,734 --> 01:03:30,334
If you see one don't try
to restrain 'em yourselves.

795
01:03:30,374 --> 01:03:31,854
These fuckers'll kill you.

796
01:03:32,014 --> 01:03:33,214
Clear?

797
01:03:33,654 --> 01:03:36,934
Get your asses moving then,
go on.

798
01:04:31,014 --> 01:04:32,214
He's here.

799
01:04:36,014 --> 01:04:37,214
Laeddis.

800
01:04:38,214 --> 01:04:39,534
I can feel him.

801
01:04:43,334 --> 01:04:45,854
Tag! You're in!

802
01:04:46,654 --> 01:04:47,934
Ted!

803
01:04:56,254 --> 01:04:57,934
Hey! Hey!
