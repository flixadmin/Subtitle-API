1
00:00:52,624 --> 00:00:54,296
- Chow time!
- It's time!

2
00:00:54,463 --> 00:00:57,262
Floyd, step up to the door. Dinner time.

3
00:01:01,344 --> 00:01:03,300
Only my friends call me Floyd.

4
00:01:03,504 --> 00:01:04,784
You ain't got no friends, Floyd.

5
00:01:07,304 --> 00:01:08,304
What's that?

6
00:01:08,464 --> 00:01:10,500
- That is called loaf.
- Loaf.

7
00:01:10,664 --> 00:01:12,859
It's got a little bit of pasghetti
in there.

8
00:01:13,024 --> 00:01:14,423
Toenails.

9
00:01:15,104 --> 00:01:16,104
Rat shit.

10
00:01:16,264 --> 00:01:18,300
Everything a growing fella needs,
like you.

11
00:01:20,064 --> 00:01:22,160
Come here. Can I tell you something?
Can I tell you a secret?

12
00:01:22,184 --> 00:01:23,219
Yeah.

13
00:01:23,464 --> 00:01:24,738
One day,

14
00:01:24,904 --> 00:01:27,577
somehow, some way,
I'm gonna get outta here.

15
00:01:27,744 --> 00:01:32,056
And I'm gonna rain down on you
like the Holy Ghost.

16
00:01:34,144 --> 00:01:35,744
Man, you just threatened a staff member.

17
00:01:36,344 --> 00:01:38,494
- Yeah?
- Yeah, you have.

18
00:01:38,664 --> 00:01:39,699
Do something.

19
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:41,697
Let's have some fun.

20
00:02:10,704 --> 00:02:12,342
Open the goddamn gate!

21
00:02:12,504 --> 00:02:14,540
Come on, guys.
Don't waste my time.

22
00:02:15,024 --> 00:02:18,539
Sector C! Pull your heads outta your ass!
Boss is on deck!

23
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,224
Open!

24
00:02:22,464 --> 00:02:23,800
Bravo 14, open perimeter fence.

25
00:02:23,824 --> 00:02:25,040
Stay back!

26
00:02:25,064 --> 00:02:27,532
If she moves, fire her up, all right?

27
00:02:29,184 --> 00:02:31,220
You gonna come down from there or what?

28
00:02:34,304 --> 00:02:35,419
Look at you.

29
00:02:38,384 --> 00:02:39,824
You know the rules, hotness.

30
00:02:39,944 --> 00:02:41,297
You gotta keep off these bars.

31
00:02:41,464 --> 00:02:43,341
- What, these bars?
- Yeah. Those bars.

32
00:02:44,224 --> 00:02:46,055
Oh, my God.

33
00:02:47,864 --> 00:02:50,617
You are really
in bad shape upstairs, lady!

34
00:02:51,584 --> 00:02:53,024
Gonna come in here and tell me that?

35
00:02:53,424 --> 00:02:55,016
Or are you too scared?

36
00:02:55,624 --> 00:02:57,057
Come on, I'm bored.

37
00:02:57,264 --> 00:02:58,902
I'm bored. Play with me.

38
00:02:59,064 --> 00:03:01,304
You put five of my guards
in the hospital, honey.

39
00:03:01,424 --> 00:03:03,176
No one's gonna play with you.

40
00:03:03,744 --> 00:03:04,744
You sleep on the ground.

41
00:03:05,384 --> 00:03:09,218
I sleep where I want,
when I want, with who I want.

42
00:03:10,944 --> 00:03:12,263
Oh, man. I love you.

43
00:03:12,944 --> 00:03:14,423
Alpha One, hit her.

44
00:03:16,784 --> 00:03:19,935
Come on, man. You're
six foot four. She's a tiny little girl.

45
00:03:21,424 --> 00:03:22,840
You got a choice tonight.
What we got here?

46
00:03:22,864 --> 00:03:25,503
We got chocolate, strawberry, or vanilla.

47
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:28,974
My job is to keep you alive until you die.
Do you understand that?

48
00:03:29,144 --> 00:03:30,144
Ahh!

49
00:03:30,464 --> 00:03:31,464
Spring break!

50
00:03:35,624 --> 00:03:36,624
Whoo.

51
00:03:37,424 --> 00:03:40,734
That is just a whole lot of pretty
in a whole lot of crazy.

52
00:04:01,504 --> 00:04:04,416
The world changed
when Superman flew across the sky.

53
00:04:05,984 --> 00:04:08,179
And then it changed again when he didn't.

54
00:04:18,984 --> 00:04:20,975
And that is why I'm here.

55
00:04:42,864 --> 00:04:44,217
We lose a national hero,

56
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:46,704
but you sit there looking like
the cat that ate the canary.

57
00:04:46,944 --> 00:04:48,536
I've eaten a lot of canaries.

58
00:04:49,304 --> 00:04:50,373
It's taken some work.

59
00:04:51,264 --> 00:04:54,574
But I finally have them.
The worst of the worst.

60
00:04:57,024 --> 00:05:00,539
There's rumors, Amanda,
that some of them have abilities.

61
00:05:01,264 --> 00:05:03,061
Well, the rumors are right.

62
00:05:03,264 --> 00:05:05,698
You know what the problem
with a metahuman is?

63
00:05:05,864 --> 00:05:06,933
The human part.

64
00:05:07,144 --> 00:05:10,341
We got lucky with Superman.
He shared our values.

65
00:05:10,504 --> 00:05:11,698
The next Superman might not.

66
00:05:11,864 --> 00:05:13,502
You're playing with fire, Amanda.

67
00:05:13,664 --> 00:05:15,700
I'm fighting fire with fire.

68
00:05:15,904 --> 00:05:17,080
You're not going to pitch us that

69
00:05:17,104 --> 00:05:20,062
Task Force X project
of yours again, are you?

70
00:05:20,224 --> 00:05:21,224
Yes.

71
00:05:21,624 --> 00:05:23,024
But this time, you're gonna listen.

72
00:05:25,064 --> 00:05:27,942
Floyd Lawton, aka Deadshot.

73
00:05:44,064 --> 00:05:46,624
He's the most wanted hitman in the world.

74
00:05:51,104 --> 00:05:53,777
Let's say he has an elite clientele.

75
00:05:54,944 --> 00:05:57,253
- What?
- Hey, Angelo.

76
00:05:57,424 --> 00:06:00,541
This is the exterminator
you called for your rat problem.

77
00:06:00,704 --> 00:06:02,376
My account's looking a little thin.

78
00:06:03,904 --> 00:06:06,259
No one gets paid until
what needs to get done gets done.

79
00:06:06,424 --> 00:06:08,415
Nope. That's not the rules.
No money, no honey.

80
00:06:10,184 --> 00:06:11,822
Whoa. Here's your boy right now.

81
00:06:13,384 --> 00:06:15,579
With about 20 of his new best friends.

82
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:22,182
I'm still seeing zeroes over here, Angie.

83
00:06:22,384 --> 00:06:24,693
Listen, stop being cute and do your job!

84
00:06:25,784 --> 00:06:27,560
They're taking him
outta the car now.

85
00:06:27,584 --> 00:06:30,621
In about 30 seconds,
your window is gonna close forever.

86
00:06:30,784 --> 00:06:33,696
Okay. Okay, okay. Relax.
There was an accounting error.

87
00:06:35,064 --> 00:06:36,463
We sent it.

88
00:06:36,624 --> 00:06:39,218
Now double it for being a dickhead.
You got 10 seconds.

89
00:06:39,384 --> 00:06:41,215
We're not the kind of people
you play with.

90
00:06:41,384 --> 00:06:43,181
Did you just... Did you threaten me?

91
00:06:43,344 --> 00:06:46,264
This dude's gonna get a sore throat
from all the singing he's about to do.

92
00:06:46,304 --> 00:06:47,453
You son of a bitch.

93
00:06:49,824 --> 00:06:51,780
Pleasure doing business with you, Angie.

94
00:07:09,944 --> 00:07:13,573
But everyone has a weakness.
And a weakness can be leveraged.

95
00:07:13,744 --> 00:07:16,736
His is an 11 -year-old honor student
in Gotham City.

96
00:07:16,944 --> 00:07:17,944
His daughter.

97
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:20,779
So we watched her and waited.

98
00:07:20,984 --> 00:07:22,576
You should talk to Mama more.

99
00:07:23,424 --> 00:07:24,493
Yeah, yeah, I know.

100
00:07:24,664 --> 00:07:26,461
Mama stays in bed a lot.

101
00:07:26,624 --> 00:07:28,774
Yeah. She's still going out at night?

102
00:07:28,944 --> 00:07:32,175
Dad, it's okay. I can take care of her.

103
00:07:33,264 --> 00:07:35,141
I know how to make pancakes now.

104
00:07:35,304 --> 00:07:37,181
Hey, babe, that's beautiful.

105
00:07:37,344 --> 00:07:39,175
Um, she's supposed to be
taking care of you.

106
00:07:39,424 --> 00:07:41,184
You know, that's how
that's supposed to work.

107
00:07:43,384 --> 00:07:45,181
I want you to come live with me.

108
00:07:45,904 --> 00:07:49,783
All right? I came into some resources.
I'mma get us a spot.

109
00:07:49,944 --> 00:07:51,696
It's gonna be nice, all right?

110
00:07:51,864 --> 00:07:55,140
Mama says I can't live with you
because you kill people.

111
00:07:55,824 --> 00:07:58,702
That's not true.
That's a lie. She's lying to you.

112
00:07:58,864 --> 00:08:01,936
Daddy... I know you do bad things.

113
00:08:02,704 --> 00:08:04,934
Don't worry, I still love you.

114
00:08:08,064 --> 00:08:09,213
Come on.

115
00:08:10,544 --> 00:08:12,421
- And you caught him?
- Not me.

116
00:08:12,624 --> 00:08:15,741
I just gave an anonymous tip
to the right guy in Gotham City.

117
00:08:15,904 --> 00:08:19,021
I'mma figure this out. All right?

118
00:08:23,864 --> 00:08:24,984
It's over, Deadshot.

119
00:08:26,344 --> 00:08:28,304
I don't want to do this
in front of your daughter.

120
00:08:37,544 --> 00:08:39,614
- Daddy, please.
- Zoe, move!

121
00:08:40,264 --> 00:08:42,414
Please, Daddy. Don't do it.

122
00:08:44,584 --> 00:08:45,733
Please.

123
00:08:47,104 --> 00:08:48,104
Don't do it.

124
00:08:59,624 --> 00:09:00,624
All right.

125
00:09:08,784 --> 00:09:10,137
Love you, Daddy.

126
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,454
So now we have the man who never misses.

127
00:09:13,624 --> 00:09:14,624
Where'd you put him?

128
00:09:14,784 --> 00:09:17,144
Let's just say, I put him in a hole
and threw away the hole.

129
00:09:19,664 --> 00:09:20,699
Harley Quinn.

130
00:09:29,104 --> 00:09:31,220
Before she ran off
and joined the circus,

131
00:09:31,384 --> 00:09:33,818
she was known as Dr. Harleen Quinzel.

132
00:09:33,984 --> 00:09:36,259
A psychiatrist at Arkham Asylum.

133
00:09:37,384 --> 00:09:40,296
She was assigned to The Clown himself.

134
00:09:40,504 --> 00:09:42,381
Dr. Quinzel.

135
00:09:43,184 --> 00:09:44,904
You know,
I live for these moments with you.

136
00:09:46,264 --> 00:09:48,334
- What do you got?
- I got you a kitty.

137
00:09:49,664 --> 00:09:50,813
So thoughtful.

138
00:09:50,984 --> 00:09:54,260
She thought she was curing him,
but she was falling in love.

139
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,943
There is something
you could do for me, doctor.

140
00:09:59,144 --> 00:10:00,144
Anything. I mean, yeah.

141
00:10:01,424 --> 00:10:03,540
I need a machine gun.

142
00:10:05,824 --> 00:10:06,859
A machine gun?

143
00:10:09,144 --> 00:10:11,738
Talk about a workplace romance gone wrong.

144
00:10:23,024 --> 00:10:24,252
Get off me.

145
00:10:25,184 --> 00:10:26,184
Shh!

146
00:10:28,424 --> 00:10:30,574
What do we have here?

147
00:10:32,024 --> 00:10:34,492
I did everything you said. I helped you.

148
00:10:34,664 --> 00:10:35,664
Ah.

149
00:10:36,384 --> 00:10:38,022
You helped me.

150
00:10:38,224 --> 00:10:40,658
By erasing my mind?

151
00:10:40,824 --> 00:10:44,419
What few faded memories I had.

152
00:10:45,424 --> 00:10:46,539
No.

153
00:10:47,224 --> 00:10:51,217
You left me in a black hole
of rage and confusion.

154
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:54,774
Is that the medicine
you practice, Dr. Quinzel?

155
00:10:54,944 --> 00:10:56,900
What are you gonna do?
You gonna kill me, Mr. J?

156
00:10:57,064 --> 00:10:58,383
What?

157
00:11:00,824 --> 00:11:02,576
Oh, I'm not gonna kill ya.

158
00:11:03,504 --> 00:11:05,301
I'm just gonna hurt ya

159
00:11:05,504 --> 00:11:09,656
really, really bad.

160
00:11:09,824 --> 00:11:10,824
You think so?

161
00:11:11,424 --> 00:11:13,415
Well, I can take it.

162
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:18,303
I wouldn't want you to break
those perfect porcelain-capped teeth

163
00:11:18,464 --> 00:11:21,297
when the juice hits your brain.

164
00:11:28,344 --> 00:11:31,381
They became the king
and queen of Gotham City.

165
00:11:31,544 --> 00:11:34,536
And God help anyone
who disrespected the queen.

166
00:11:35,224 --> 00:11:36,703
We finally meet.

167
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:38,120
Nah, he don't shake hands.

168
00:11:38,144 --> 00:11:40,612
But sit down and have a drink.

169
00:11:44,424 --> 00:11:45,539
Hey, J.

170
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:49,060
On behalf of everybody, welcome back.

171
00:11:49,224 --> 00:11:51,784
I wanted to come by
and personally say thank you.

172
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:54,538
You making me good money.
I'm making you good money.

173
00:11:55,104 --> 00:11:57,299
Are you sweet talking me?

174
00:12:00,304 --> 00:12:02,215
I love this guy.

175
00:12:02,904 --> 00:12:05,134
He's so intense!

176
00:12:09,424 --> 00:12:11,301
Mmm. You're a lucky man.

177
00:12:12,704 --> 00:12:14,501
You got a bad bitch.

178
00:12:17,064 --> 00:12:18,622
Oh, that she is.

179
00:12:20,144 --> 00:12:22,180
The fire in my loins.

180
00:12:24,064 --> 00:12:25,816
The itch in my crotch.

181
00:12:25,984 --> 00:12:30,853
The one, the only,
the infamous Harley Quinn!

182
00:12:40,824 --> 00:12:42,780
Oh, come to Daddy.

183
00:12:44,424 --> 00:12:46,142
Puddin'!

184
00:12:46,904 --> 00:12:47,939
Listen,

185
00:12:48,144 --> 00:12:52,296
you are my gift
to this handsome hunka hunka!

186
00:12:52,464 --> 00:12:55,024
You belong to him now.

187
00:12:55,184 --> 00:12:56,503
Well...

188
00:12:59,624 --> 00:13:00,977
You're cute.

189
00:13:01,424 --> 00:13:02,743
You want me?

190
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:05,497
I'm all yours.

191
00:13:09,104 --> 00:13:10,104
I don't want no beef.

192
00:13:10,264 --> 00:13:12,698
You don't want no beef?
You don't want no beef?

193
00:13:12,864 --> 00:13:14,934
Why, what's wrong?
You don't like me?

194
00:13:15,104 --> 00:13:16,776
Fine. Don't waste my time then.

195
00:13:16,944 --> 00:13:18,172
This is your lady.

196
00:13:18,384 --> 00:13:21,535
Look, are you enjoying yourself?

197
00:13:23,024 --> 00:13:24,218
No.

198
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:26,098
That's your lady, Joker.

199
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:27,264
That's right.

200
00:13:27,464 --> 00:13:28,533
Yo, J.

201
00:13:32,184 --> 00:13:33,784
And that was just the beginning.

202
00:13:42,544 --> 00:13:44,375
Come on, Puddin'. Do it!

203
00:13:45,504 --> 00:13:46,504
Oh.

204
00:13:47,664 --> 00:13:49,017
We have got company.

205
00:13:49,184 --> 00:13:51,334
Batsy, Batsy, Batsy.

206
00:13:53,864 --> 00:13:55,616
She's crazier than him.

207
00:13:55,784 --> 00:13:57,581
And more fearless.

208
00:13:58,224 --> 00:14:01,057
Stupid Bat, you're ruining date night!

209
00:14:03,744 --> 00:14:04,859
Puddin'.

210
00:14:07,344 --> 00:14:09,255
Puddin', I can't swim!

211
00:14:46,624 --> 00:14:50,742
But the Bat got her, too.
She's in the same hole as Deadshot.

212
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:06,657
And then there's the Aussie.

213
00:15:07,384 --> 00:15:08,817
Digger Harkness.

214
00:15:08,984 --> 00:15:11,817
Or as the tabloids call him,
Captain Boomerang.

215
00:15:20,264 --> 00:15:22,983
We're gonna be rich.

216
00:15:23,264 --> 00:15:24,458
Yeah, you and me, mate.

217
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:26,023
Go and get the car.

218
00:15:26,224 --> 00:15:28,454
He robbed every bank
in Australia at least once.

219
00:15:28,624 --> 00:15:31,741
Then he came to America
for a fresh target set.

220
00:15:34,064 --> 00:15:35,702
Doesn't work well with others.

221
00:15:40,864 --> 00:15:42,456
No honor among thieves, eh?

222
00:15:44,504 --> 00:15:47,496
But he tangled with a metahuman
and lived to tell about it.

223
00:15:48,184 --> 00:15:51,381
And have you heard of
the pyrokinetic homeboy?

224
00:15:55,184 --> 00:15:56,617
How'd you catch him?

225
00:15:56,784 --> 00:15:58,342
We didn't. He surrendered.

226
00:16:00,184 --> 00:16:03,893
Chato Santana.
On the streets they call him El Diablo.

227
00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:06,578
This LA gangbanger thought
he was king of the world...

228
00:16:07,904 --> 00:16:09,223
...until he lost his queen.

229
00:16:12,344 --> 00:16:15,461
Gets jumped in a prison riot
and incinerates half the yard.

230
00:16:15,624 --> 00:16:17,740
The security video is incredible.

231
00:16:21,984 --> 00:16:24,373
Oh, Jesus. The hell is that?

232
00:16:24,544 --> 00:16:26,182
His name is Waylon Jones.

233
00:16:26,784 --> 00:16:29,457
Evolution took a step
backwards with this one.

234
00:16:31,584 --> 00:16:34,815
Yo, K.C., it's supper.

235
00:16:34,984 --> 00:16:36,656
Go ahead, open that up, B.

236
00:16:40,424 --> 00:16:42,104
Got something
real nice for you today, boy.

237
00:16:42,664 --> 00:16:44,700
Hey, boss,
it true he chewed a dude's hand off?

238
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:49,297
Look at that, right there.
Vulcanized rubber.

239
00:16:54,544 --> 00:16:55,897
Give me that, Smitty.

240
00:16:57,064 --> 00:16:58,213
Where you at?

241
00:16:58,384 --> 00:16:59,737
Don't make me get you.

242
00:17:00,264 --> 00:17:02,095
They call him Killer Croc.

243
00:17:06,424 --> 00:17:07,744
Here you are! You hungry?

244
00:17:07,864 --> 00:17:10,936
You want some food?
Go ahead, feed the man.

245
00:17:11,624 --> 00:17:13,216
What are you in the mood for tonight?

246
00:17:13,384 --> 00:17:18,060
I got a double cheeseburger,
onion rings, a little coleslaw.

247
00:17:18,544 --> 00:17:20,853
Or a giant skinless goat.

248
00:17:30,344 --> 00:17:31,857
He looked like a monster.

249
00:17:32,784 --> 00:17:34,900
So they treated him like a monster.

250
00:17:36,544 --> 00:17:39,012
Then he became a monster.

251
00:17:43,304 --> 00:17:45,215
He was chased out of Gotham by the Bat.

252
00:17:45,384 --> 00:17:47,978
Went searching for sanctuary elsewhere.

253
00:17:48,144 --> 00:17:49,543
He never found it.

254
00:17:57,664 --> 00:17:59,973
I saved the best for last.

255
00:18:00,144 --> 00:18:02,260
- The witch.
- A witch?

256
00:18:02,464 --> 00:18:05,695
I'm talking a flying, spell-casting,
making-shit-disappear witch.

257
00:18:05,864 --> 00:18:08,697
A sorceress from another dimension.
Another world.

258
00:18:10,664 --> 00:18:13,497
Archeologist Dr. June Moone,

259
00:18:14,744 --> 00:18:16,735
wandered into the wrong cave.

260
00:18:24,664 --> 00:18:27,303
June...

261
00:18:30,584 --> 00:18:32,544
She opened something she shouldn't have...

262
00:18:43,824 --> 00:18:47,294
...releasing a metahuman more powerful
than any we've encountered.

263
00:18:48,504 --> 00:18:49,732
The Enchantress.

264
00:18:55,624 --> 00:18:57,740
She inhabits Dr. Moone's body now.

265
00:18:58,464 --> 00:18:59,533
And where is this witch?

266
00:19:00,144 --> 00:19:01,577
In my pocket.

267
00:19:01,744 --> 00:19:03,894
Now tell him
why she won't turn you into a frog.

268
00:19:04,104 --> 00:19:06,937
Some say the witch
has a secret buried heart,

269
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,572
and whoever finds it
can control the witch.

270
00:19:09,744 --> 00:19:11,424
So we searched the cave
where she turned up

271
00:19:11,544 --> 00:19:13,182
and we found her heart.

272
00:19:16,744 --> 00:19:18,143
That thing's her heart?

273
00:19:18,384 --> 00:19:20,375
Mmm-hmm. She's vulnerable without it.

274
00:19:20,624 --> 00:19:23,138
You want to put our national security
in the hands of

275
00:19:23,304 --> 00:19:26,501
witches, gangbangers, and crocodiles?

276
00:19:26,664 --> 00:19:28,080
Don't forget about The Joker's girlfriend.

277
00:19:28,104 --> 00:19:29,219
These are villains, Amanda.

278
00:19:29,424 --> 00:19:31,335
What makes you think you can control them?

279
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:34,464
Because getting people to act
against their own self-interest

280
00:19:34,624 --> 00:19:36,740
for the national security
of the United States

281
00:19:36,904 --> 00:19:38,576
is what I do for a living.

282
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:42,578
You take the finest special forces officer
this nation has ever produced,

283
00:19:42,744 --> 00:19:43,859
Colonel Rick Flag.

284
00:20:07,584 --> 00:20:09,097
Help me.

285
00:20:09,264 --> 00:20:10,944
I assigned him to watch Dr. Moone,

286
00:20:11,104 --> 00:20:13,902
and just as I hoped, it got personal.

287
00:20:14,584 --> 00:20:16,176
Are you gonna kiss me or not?

288
00:20:16,384 --> 00:20:17,942
I have the witch's heart.

289
00:20:18,104 --> 00:20:19,935
And Dr. Moone has his.

290
00:20:21,504 --> 00:20:24,382
Now he'll follow my orders as Holy Writ.

291
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,254
In a world of flying men and monsters,

292
00:20:29,424 --> 00:20:32,461
this is the only way
to protect our country.

293
00:20:36,024 --> 00:20:39,699
What if Superman had decided to fly down,

294
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:41,661
rip off the roof of the White House

295
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:43,504
and grab the President
of the United States

296
00:20:43,664 --> 00:20:44,824
right out of the Oval Office?

297
00:20:45,664 --> 00:20:47,097
Who would've stopped him?

298
00:20:48,264 --> 00:20:51,256
We got contingency plans
for nukes in North Korea,

299
00:20:51,464 --> 00:20:53,694
anthrax in our mail.
We got fluoride in our water.

300
00:20:53,864 --> 00:20:58,540
But what happens if the next Superman
becomes a terrorist?

301
00:20:59,664 --> 00:21:01,780
Amanda Waller has a plan. Amanda?

302
00:21:01,944 --> 00:21:04,253
I wanna build a team
of some very bad people

303
00:21:04,424 --> 00:21:06,062
who I think can do some good.

304
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:08,692
Like fight the next war,
defeat the next Superman.

305
00:21:08,864 --> 00:21:10,343
Not on my watch.

306
00:21:10,504 --> 00:21:13,940
You're not putting those monsters
back out on the street in our name.

307
00:21:14,104 --> 00:21:16,379
General, we run them
covertly, non-attributed.

308
00:21:16,544 --> 00:21:18,023
Strictly need to know.

309
00:21:18,184 --> 00:21:20,334
And if they get caught,
we throw them under the bus.

310
00:21:20,984 --> 00:21:23,100
The next war will be fought
with these metahumans.

311
00:21:23,264 --> 00:21:25,255
Ours, or theirs.

312
00:21:25,424 --> 00:21:27,813
We're not the only ones
kicking up rocks looking for them.

313
00:21:27,984 --> 00:21:30,054
You know we can't control these people.

314
00:21:35,904 --> 00:21:37,337
June, be strong.

315
00:21:38,624 --> 00:21:39,693
Dr. Moone.

316
00:22:04,744 --> 00:22:06,302
Enchantress.

317
00:22:20,904 --> 00:22:22,781
Meet the Enchantress.

318
00:22:22,944 --> 00:22:26,061
Everything we know about her
is in your briefing packs.

319
00:22:26,264 --> 00:22:28,983
She's walked this earth
for a very long time

320
00:22:29,184 --> 00:22:31,414
and will likely be here
when we're long gone.

321
00:22:31,584 --> 00:22:34,144
This meeting is now a magic show?

322
00:22:34,304 --> 00:22:37,296
Magic or not, this girl can do
some pretty incredible things.

323
00:22:39,944 --> 00:22:41,457
Go get it, girl.

324
00:22:57,024 --> 00:23:01,097
How about a little something
from the weapons ministry vault in Tehran?

325
00:23:10,424 --> 00:23:13,257
We've been chasing these plans for years.

326
00:23:15,464 --> 00:23:17,659
Uh, please don't touch me.
Please don't touch me.

327
00:23:17,824 --> 00:23:19,780
Thank you. We'd like Dr. Moone back.

328
00:23:28,984 --> 00:23:30,497
Enchantress.

329
00:23:32,584 --> 00:23:34,142
Please. Please.

330
00:23:34,304 --> 00:23:36,534
I'm sorry, I can't do that again.

331
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:38,262
Flag, get her out of here.

332
00:23:40,984 --> 00:23:45,978
I move to, uh, authorize Amanda Waller
to establish Task Force X

333
00:23:46,144 --> 00:23:47,702
under the ARGUS program.

334
00:23:49,984 --> 00:23:51,337
All right.

335
00:23:51,744 --> 00:23:53,541
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

336
00:24:08,064 --> 00:24:09,497
I know you do bad things.

337
00:24:10,504 --> 00:24:13,177
Don't worry, I still love you.

338
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:28,184
Welcome to Belle Reve,
special security barracks.

339
00:24:28,224 --> 00:24:29,543
How you doing, man?

340
00:24:29,704 --> 00:24:31,424
Why don't you kiss her ass?
She's in charge.

341
00:24:31,584 --> 00:24:33,256
Welcome, ma'am. How are you?

342
00:24:33,424 --> 00:24:35,380
I'm here to assist you in any way.

343
00:24:36,064 --> 00:24:37,383
Where are they?

344
00:24:54,824 --> 00:24:56,815
Are you the Devil?

345
00:24:59,104 --> 00:25:00,583
Maybe.

346
00:25:30,464 --> 00:25:32,455
Ain't you scared?

347
00:25:37,424 --> 00:25:39,733
Why'd they put you down here?

348
00:25:41,544 --> 00:25:43,182
I asked.

349
00:25:47,384 --> 00:25:48,783
Open that gate.

350
00:25:54,904 --> 00:25:56,656
Yo, ese.

351
00:25:56,824 --> 00:25:58,416
Hola, amigo.

352
00:25:59,584 --> 00:26:01,779
Put that burrito down.
You got visitors, man.

353
00:26:13,144 --> 00:26:15,897
What's up? Hey, you want some of this?

354
00:26:16,064 --> 00:26:17,064
Then come down here.

355
00:26:18,224 --> 00:26:19,782
That ain't me.

356
00:26:19,944 --> 00:26:20,944
That wasn't you?

357
00:26:21,104 --> 00:26:24,301
Nah, they say it's me, but that ain't me.
That guy's gone.

358
00:26:24,504 --> 00:26:25,653
He's dead.

359
00:26:25,824 --> 00:26:27,780
- And yet, here you are.
- Ma'am.

360
00:26:27,944 --> 00:26:29,343
Let me try to talk to him.

361
00:26:34,104 --> 00:26:36,334
You wanna die in here, buddy?

362
00:26:36,504 --> 00:26:38,859
You got a real shot
at walking the block again.

363
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:41,817
Have a nice cold beer, a nice meal.

364
00:26:42,504 --> 00:26:43,504
A woman.

365
00:26:43,664 --> 00:26:47,373
Look, man, you ain't the first to ask,
and you ain't gonna be the last.

366
00:26:47,544 --> 00:26:49,023
Ask what?

367
00:26:49,184 --> 00:26:52,176
I'm a man, okay? I ain't no weapon.

368
00:26:53,264 --> 00:26:55,858
I'mma die in peace
before I raise my fists again.

369
00:26:57,304 --> 00:26:59,135
I've caused enough harm.

370
00:27:08,624 --> 00:27:09,744
All right, unlock him.

371
00:27:10,224 --> 00:27:11,976
- What?
- You heard me.

372
00:27:12,144 --> 00:27:13,372
You know what this man can do?

373
00:27:13,544 --> 00:27:16,695
I'm here to find out. Lose the restraints.

374
00:27:21,864 --> 00:27:23,058
Okay.

375
00:27:24,384 --> 00:27:27,023
What is this? Uh, cheerleading tryouts?

376
00:27:27,944 --> 00:27:29,536
Let's go. Let's see what you can do.

377
00:27:29,704 --> 00:27:32,377
They say you never missed a shot.
Prove it.

378
00:27:44,224 --> 00:27:45,224
Mmm-hmm.

379
00:27:46,184 --> 00:27:49,415
Now you got one in the chamber.
What you gonna do with it?

380
00:27:49,984 --> 00:27:51,178
Shit!

381
00:27:51,944 --> 00:27:53,741
Give me the word, boss. I'll drop him.

382
00:27:53,904 --> 00:27:55,098
Everybody calm down.

383
00:27:55,304 --> 00:27:56,744
Griggs, tell your men to stand down.

384
00:27:56,904 --> 00:27:58,240
Tell them, "Put it down."

385
00:27:58,264 --> 00:27:59,264
Stand down.

386
00:27:59,464 --> 00:28:02,217
Colonel, for the record, this is exactly
what I was concerned about.

387
00:28:02,424 --> 00:28:03,424
What's for dinner?

388
00:28:03,584 --> 00:28:04,903
Ames, if this man shoots me,

389
00:28:05,144 --> 00:28:06,896
I want you to kill him

390
00:28:07,624 --> 00:28:09,501
and I want you to go clear
my browser history.

391
00:28:10,984 --> 00:28:14,579
See, uh,
the firing pin is filed down, right?

392
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:18,215
Mag full of dummy rounds.
If I pull the trigger, nothing happens.

393
00:28:18,384 --> 00:28:20,022
You're absolutely right.

394
00:28:20,184 --> 00:28:22,903
Why would we give a loaded weapon
to an infamous hitman?

395
00:28:23,064 --> 00:28:25,578
Go ahead, pull the trigger. Empty it.

396
00:28:25,744 --> 00:28:28,099
Don't empty nothing.
You don't even know this lady.

397
00:28:28,264 --> 00:28:30,016
I've known you, like, nine months.

398
00:28:30,184 --> 00:28:32,704
Remember when I brought you that cookie?
That was a real cookie.

399
00:28:35,384 --> 00:28:37,022
What?

400
00:28:37,824 --> 00:28:38,824
Oops.

401
00:28:41,064 --> 00:28:43,020
Y'all jokers must be crazy.

402
00:29:32,664 --> 00:29:34,939
All right. Now you know
what you're buying.

403
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:38,335
Let me tell you the price.
First, I want out of here.

404
00:29:38,504 --> 00:29:41,576
Second, I want full custody
of my daughter.

405
00:29:41,784 --> 00:29:44,696
All right? And her mom can have, like,
supervised visits.

406
00:29:44,864 --> 00:29:48,095
But her stank-ass boyfriend can't come.
Darnell can't come.

407
00:29:48,264 --> 00:29:49,856
- Darnell's out.
- He's out.

408
00:29:50,024 --> 00:29:52,857
Third, y'all gonna pay
for my daughter's whole education.

409
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:55,697
Best schools.
And then I want her to go to college.

410
00:29:55,864 --> 00:29:57,377
Like Harvard. Or Yale.

411
00:29:57,544 --> 00:29:59,341
- So Ivy League.
- Ivy League, yeah.

412
00:29:59,504 --> 00:30:01,080
- One of them big joints, you know?
- Mmm-hmm.

413
00:30:01,104 --> 00:30:04,016
And, uh, if she can't cut it
and her grades start slipping,

414
00:30:04,224 --> 00:30:05,744
I need you to white-people that thing.

415
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:07,000
- Mmm-hmm.
- You know how y'all do.

416
00:30:07,024 --> 00:30:08,424
- Oh, yeah.
- You know, right? Okay.

417
00:30:08,544 --> 00:30:09,818
Now that's my price.

418
00:30:10,024 --> 00:30:13,175
But I'm concerned 'cause I don't see
nobody writing shit down.

419
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:15,699
You're in no position to make any demands.

420
00:30:16,104 --> 00:30:18,698
Oh. I'm sorry.
You thought I was talking to you.

421
00:30:19,544 --> 00:30:22,456
No, errand boy. I'm talking to your boss.

422
00:30:24,744 --> 00:30:27,861
That's my price, sweetie.
You know what it is.

423
00:30:32,384 --> 00:30:34,215
You notice these are criminals, hmm?

424
00:30:34,424 --> 00:30:37,734
They're psychotic, antisocial freaks.
It makes no sense.

425
00:30:37,904 --> 00:30:39,784
Let me hit the Tier One units
and I'll build you

426
00:30:39,944 --> 00:30:41,840
a team of pipe hitters who'll
do anything you can dream up.

427
00:30:41,864 --> 00:30:44,014
I mean, you need real soldiers.
Not these scumbags.

428
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:46,738
In World War Two,
the US Navy made a deal with the mafia

429
00:30:46,904 --> 00:30:48,542
to protect its ships on the waterfront.

430
00:30:48,704 --> 00:30:50,137
This ain't World War Two.

431
00:30:50,304 --> 00:30:51,623
It's World War Three.

432
00:30:52,264 --> 00:30:53,697
What are you really up to?

433
00:30:53,864 --> 00:30:56,537
It's a "need to know", and all you need
to know is you work for me.

434
00:30:56,704 --> 00:31:00,014
That can change with a phone call.
I have friends, too, you know.

435
00:31:02,384 --> 00:31:03,976
There you go. Call.

436
00:31:04,504 --> 00:31:05,624
But without you minding her,

437
00:31:05,824 --> 00:31:09,658
your lady friend stays here strapped
to a board in a drug-induced coma.

438
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:12,776
They warned me about you.

439
00:31:14,464 --> 00:31:16,739
My dumb ass didn't believe the stories.

440
00:31:22,304 --> 00:31:23,817
Nobody does.

441
00:31:33,584 --> 00:31:35,097
Where is she?

442
00:31:35,264 --> 00:31:38,301
It's complex. This is not just her.

443
00:31:38,464 --> 00:31:40,295
Everybody's disappearing.

444
00:31:40,464 --> 00:31:41,464
There's this new law,

445
00:31:41,624 --> 00:31:44,624
where if you're a bad enough bad guy,
they stamp "terrorist" on your jacket.

446
00:31:44,784 --> 00:31:48,663
They send you to this swamp in Louisiana.
A black site.

447
00:31:49,144 --> 00:31:50,816
That's where she is.

448
00:31:52,264 --> 00:31:53,902
So what are we doing?

449
00:31:54,984 --> 00:31:56,622
Bring the car around.

450
00:31:57,384 --> 00:31:59,454
We're going for a drive.

451
00:32:19,344 --> 00:32:22,097
Lester, Lester!
Hit me one more time!

452
00:32:22,864 --> 00:32:24,013
Come on, man!

453
00:32:24,184 --> 00:32:26,744
You gotta call upstairs and tell them
to float me another 10 K.

454
00:32:27,464 --> 00:32:28,464
- Hey!
- Ow!

455
00:32:28,704 --> 00:32:31,013
- Boss wants to see you.
- You know who I am?

456
00:32:36,184 --> 00:32:38,334
Good job, man. He's killing it.

457
00:32:38,544 --> 00:32:39,772
Come on, man. Why am I here?

458
00:32:39,944 --> 00:32:41,900
All right, yeah, I'm down.
I get it, all right?

459
00:32:42,064 --> 00:32:46,182
I've had a run of bad decks.
Not my fault. All right?

460
00:32:46,384 --> 00:32:47,897
Dude, this is real.

461
00:32:48,064 --> 00:32:51,056
I had to stop these guys from burning
down your house with your kids in it.

462
00:32:56,384 --> 00:32:57,783
But you're lucky.

463
00:32:57,984 --> 00:32:59,940
Maybe. Why do you think so?

464
00:33:03,984 --> 00:33:05,656
Yo, slick. What's up?

465
00:33:07,064 --> 00:33:08,895
Griggs. You are?

466
00:33:09,064 --> 00:33:10,544
You might wanna keep your mouth shut.

467
00:33:11,384 --> 00:33:13,420
Can I go, man?
What the hell is going on, man?

468
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:14,943
This is crazy.

469
00:33:15,144 --> 00:33:16,702
Blah, blah-blah, blah-blah.

470
00:33:16,864 --> 00:33:18,980
Blah-blah, blah, blah.

471
00:33:20,504 --> 00:33:23,143
All of that chitchat's gonna get ya hurt.

472
00:33:23,424 --> 00:33:24,573
Oh! My God!

473
00:33:31,584 --> 00:33:32,584
Mmm.

474
00:33:45,104 --> 00:33:46,742
I could tell you meant that.

475
00:33:46,944 --> 00:33:49,822
Yeah.

476
00:33:51,024 --> 00:33:53,094
You're gonna be my friend.

477
00:34:09,944 --> 00:34:12,094
Enchantress.

478
00:34:23,624 --> 00:34:25,979
- Log time of death. 1620.
- June?

479
00:34:28,264 --> 00:34:29,864
Let's get her down to the morgue.

480
00:34:29,904 --> 00:34:31,656
June? June?

481
00:34:32,864 --> 00:34:33,979
June.

482
00:34:35,304 --> 00:34:36,373
June.

483
00:34:39,384 --> 00:34:40,737
What did you do?

484
00:34:41,584 --> 00:34:42,584
Shh.

485
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,733
Okay.

486
00:35:21,944 --> 00:35:23,980
Plus, it could be the routing number.

487
00:35:24,864 --> 00:35:27,014
Wanna go for drinks?

488
00:36:23,904 --> 00:36:25,576
Enchantress.

489
00:36:27,944 --> 00:36:29,616
God damn it!

490
00:36:30,704 --> 00:36:32,979
June! June!

491
00:36:35,544 --> 00:36:37,102
June, I'm sorry.

492
00:36:42,144 --> 00:36:43,179
Shh.

493
00:36:47,944 --> 00:36:49,582
She went somewhere.

494
00:36:50,984 --> 00:36:55,455
If you have to choose between her or me,
stop her.

495
00:36:55,624 --> 00:36:57,660
Promise me you'll stop her.

496
00:37:01,744 --> 00:37:03,143
Even if it kills me.

497
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:32,337
Sir. Sir. You okay?

498
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:35,339
Can you breathe? Did you take anything?

499
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:39,018
This is 21.
Send medical to my location.

500
00:37:39,984 --> 00:37:41,212
I'm a physician.

501
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:43,320
Roger. Bringing medical to your location.

502
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:45,574
No pulse. Starting compressions.

503
00:38:13,104 --> 00:38:14,332
Sir.

504
00:38:14,544 --> 00:38:17,183
Midway City is under attack.
It's a non-human entity.

505
00:38:17,384 --> 00:38:18,704
I think you know what to do, sir.

506
00:38:18,864 --> 00:38:20,741
Activate Task Force X

507
00:38:20,904 --> 00:38:23,464
and get Amanda Waller
and her whole circus on scene ASAP.

508
00:38:23,624 --> 00:38:24,659
Sir.

509
00:38:26,584 --> 00:38:28,575
We're going live
with Task Force X. Pull 'em.

510
00:38:34,304 --> 00:38:36,260
Prisoner,
get down on your knees, now!

511
00:38:36,424 --> 00:38:37,840
Down on your knees!
Hands in the air! Turn around.

512
00:38:37,864 --> 00:38:38,899
Hands up high!

513
00:38:39,064 --> 00:38:40,543
Hey, I'm cooperating. All right?

514
00:38:40,704 --> 00:38:42,581
- This is me being cool.
- Take her.

515
00:38:44,784 --> 00:38:46,740
Do not fire
that goddamn weapon!

516
00:38:48,464 --> 00:38:49,464
Damn it!

517
00:38:51,384 --> 00:38:53,022
Open the gate!

518
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:54,776
Everybody, line up for extraction.

519
00:38:54,944 --> 00:38:56,582
Let's go! Let's move, move.

520
00:38:57,224 --> 00:38:59,454
Yeah. Open the door! Let's go!

521
00:39:06,184 --> 00:39:07,219
Hit him!

522
00:39:07,384 --> 00:39:08,864
Hurry up, before he smokes us!

523
00:39:10,464 --> 00:39:11,499
Where you at?

524
00:39:12,104 --> 00:39:13,104
Whoa!

525
00:39:18,264 --> 00:39:19,413
Is that the new guy?

526
00:39:25,824 --> 00:39:27,424
What is that? What is that? Who are you?

527
00:39:27,504 --> 00:39:29,240
- Stand by. Arming device.
- Who are you?

528
00:39:29,264 --> 00:39:30,720
- I don't know who you are.
- Device armed.

529
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:33,497
Hey! Hey, I'm talking to you.
Hey, I'm talking to you.

530
00:39:34,104 --> 00:39:35,696
Injection successful.

531
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:37,818
Location verified.

532
00:39:38,824 --> 00:39:42,294
- Anybody who touches me is dead.
- Anybody who...

533
00:39:42,584 --> 00:39:45,303
- Lady. Hey.
- Injection successful.

534
00:39:45,464 --> 00:39:47,853
- Hey! Miss? What was that?
- Location verified.

535
00:39:48,024 --> 00:39:49,024
Next!

536
00:39:49,224 --> 00:39:51,579
Oh, you deaf. You one of them deaf hoes.

537
00:39:53,144 --> 00:39:54,293
Come on.

538
00:39:55,784 --> 00:39:57,064
Shut up, and get it done.

539
00:39:59,224 --> 00:40:00,224
Whee!

540
00:40:00,424 --> 00:40:03,024
Listen, you're being transferred.
I don't know where you're going.

541
00:40:03,224 --> 00:40:04,224
It's from Mr. J.

542
00:40:04,464 --> 00:40:05,960
You gonna tell him I took care of you?

543
00:40:05,984 --> 00:40:07,940
You're so screwed.

544
00:40:08,104 --> 00:40:10,299
What do you mean by that?
What do you mean by that?

545
00:40:10,464 --> 00:40:12,819
Get off me! Get off me!
Harley, what do you mean by that?

546
00:40:13,664 --> 00:40:15,256
Harley!

547
00:40:21,304 --> 00:40:24,296
Hey, I got a delivery.
I have a gift basket for Dr. Van Criss.

548
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:27,137
You're not on the access list.
I can't let you in. Sorry.

549
00:40:27,344 --> 00:40:30,256
Hey, cool if I leave it with you?
I'm way behind today.

550
00:40:31,264 --> 00:40:32,982
Thank you. You're a good man.

551
00:40:45,584 --> 00:40:47,017
Open up!

552
00:40:55,704 --> 00:40:57,695
Just please, do whatever they say.

553
00:40:58,504 --> 00:40:59,824
Do whatever they say. Just do it.

554
00:41:09,504 --> 00:41:10,584
Hmm.

555
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:12,573
This looks neat.

556
00:41:19,464 --> 00:41:21,420
Light it up!
Light it up! Light it up!

557
00:41:30,944 --> 00:41:32,502
He's right above us.

558
00:41:32,704 --> 00:41:34,456
This is a mistake. Rick, I can't do this.

559
00:41:34,664 --> 00:41:36,063
- I can't...
- Listen, listen.

560
00:41:36,224 --> 00:41:37,703
There's no other way.

561
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:39,942
Just get it done.

562
00:41:42,064 --> 00:41:43,577
Just get it done.

563
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:48,098
Enchantress.

564
00:41:48,744 --> 00:41:50,824
Flag, talk to me.
What's going on down there?

565
00:41:52,104 --> 00:41:53,617
Amanda, she bolted.

566
00:41:53,784 --> 00:41:55,137
Say it again?

567
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:56,817
She bolted!

568
00:41:57,464 --> 00:41:58,579
Shit!

569
00:43:00,104 --> 00:43:01,139
Go!

570
00:43:11,744 --> 00:43:14,417
Worldwide military is on alert.
Our weapons are ineffective.

571
00:43:14,584 --> 00:43:16,495
I thought this was contained!

572
00:43:31,944 --> 00:43:33,662
This is the worst day of my life!

573
00:43:35,184 --> 00:43:38,460
All evacuees
must report to a FEMA representative.

574
00:43:40,344 --> 00:43:42,175
What's going on in that city?

575
00:43:42,824 --> 00:43:44,382
Those assholes here yet?

576
00:43:44,944 --> 00:43:45,944
Yeah, they're here.

577
00:43:47,864 --> 00:43:50,173
Alpha, Bravo team, on me.

578
00:43:53,184 --> 00:43:55,140
What the hell, Flag?

579
00:43:57,704 --> 00:43:58,853
Unlock 'em.

580
00:44:05,344 --> 00:44:06,344
Mmm!

581
00:44:07,064 --> 00:44:09,214
Hi, boys! Harley Quinn.

582
00:44:09,384 --> 00:44:10,863
How do you do?

583
00:44:16,864 --> 00:44:18,013
Huh?

584
00:44:18,584 --> 00:44:21,701
What was that?
I should kill everyone and escape?

585
00:44:23,344 --> 00:44:26,097
Sorry. It's the voices.

586
00:44:27,624 --> 00:44:29,740
I'm kidding! Jeez!

587
00:44:30,784 --> 00:44:32,536
That's not what they really said.

588
00:44:32,704 --> 00:44:34,217
What do we got here?

589
00:44:34,424 --> 00:44:36,779
Twelve pounds of shit in a 10-pound sack.

590
00:44:42,824 --> 00:44:44,894
Welcome to the party,
Captain Boomerang.

591
00:44:48,584 --> 00:44:51,144
Hey, what's going on, man?

592
00:44:51,304 --> 00:44:52,304
Calm down.

593
00:44:52,464 --> 00:44:54,580
Hey, one minute
I'm playing Mahjong with me nanna,

594
00:44:54,744 --> 00:44:57,019
then this red streak hits me
outta nowhere.

595
00:44:57,184 --> 00:44:59,744
Shut up! You were caught
robbing a diamond exchange.

596
00:44:59,904 --> 00:45:01,098
I was not!

597
00:45:03,024 --> 00:45:06,937
Here comes Slipknot,
the man who can climb anything. Wonderful.

598
00:45:07,104 --> 00:45:08,776
Have a good time, scumbag.

599
00:45:09,064 --> 00:45:10,463
Ooh.

600
00:45:11,264 --> 00:45:12,379
Straighten up.

601
00:45:14,544 --> 00:45:15,943
She had a mouth.

602
00:45:16,184 --> 00:45:18,300
Listen up!

603
00:45:18,824 --> 00:45:20,462
In your necks,

604
00:45:21,304 --> 00:45:24,660
injection you got,
it's a nanite explosive.

605
00:45:24,824 --> 00:45:28,783
It's the size of a rice grain,
but it's powerful as a hand grenade.

606
00:45:28,984 --> 00:45:31,418
You disobey me, you die.

607
00:45:33,304 --> 00:45:35,613
You try to escape, you die.

608
00:45:35,824 --> 00:45:40,295
You otherwise irritate or vex me,
and guess what?

609
00:45:41,064 --> 00:45:42,213
You die.

610
00:45:42,384 --> 00:45:45,262
I'm known to be quite vexing.
I'm just forewarning you.

611
00:45:45,424 --> 00:45:46,459
Lady, shut up!

612
00:45:47,664 --> 00:45:48,858
This is the deal.

613
00:45:49,824 --> 00:45:54,295
You're going somewhere very bad,
to do something that'll get you killed.

614
00:45:54,504 --> 00:45:55,983
But until that happens,

615
00:45:57,344 --> 00:45:58,413
you're my problem.

616
00:45:58,624 --> 00:45:59,624
Mmm.

617
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:02,574
So was that like a, uh, pep talk?

618
00:46:02,744 --> 00:46:03,972
Yeah. That was a pep talk.

619
00:46:04,184 --> 00:46:05,378
There's your shit.

620
00:46:06,224 --> 00:46:08,533
Grab what you need for a fight.
We're wheels up in 10.

621
00:46:08,704 --> 00:46:10,774
You might wanna work on
your team motivation thing.

622
00:46:10,984 --> 00:46:12,576
- You heard of Phil Jackson?
- Yeah.

623
00:46:12,744 --> 00:46:14,814
He's like the gold standard, okay?

624
00:46:15,024 --> 00:46:17,663
Triangle, bitch. Study.

625
00:47:20,544 --> 00:47:21,544
What?

626
00:47:28,304 --> 00:47:29,304
Won't fit anymore?

627
00:47:31,104 --> 00:47:32,742
Too much junk in the trunk?

628
00:47:32,904 --> 00:47:36,738
Nah. Every time I put this on,
somebody dies.

629
00:47:37,904 --> 00:47:38,904
And?

630
00:47:39,984 --> 00:47:41,576
I like putting it on.

631
00:47:42,424 --> 00:47:43,539
Goody.

632
00:47:43,744 --> 00:47:46,941
Somethin' tells me
a whole lotta people are about to die!

633
00:47:47,104 --> 00:47:48,503
Yeah. It's us.

634
00:47:48,704 --> 00:47:49,904
We're being led to our deaths.

635
00:47:49,944 --> 00:47:51,384
Speak for yourself, mate.

636
00:47:51,824 --> 00:47:53,904
Hey, what's that crap on your face?
Does it wash off?

637
00:47:55,584 --> 00:47:58,462
Hey, if you like a girl, can you light
her cigarette with your pinkie?

638
00:47:58,624 --> 00:48:00,216
Because that would be real classy!

639
00:48:00,424 --> 00:48:02,938
Hey, y'all might
wanna leave old boy alone.

640
00:48:03,104 --> 00:48:06,380
He could torch this whole joint.
Ain't that right, ese?

641
00:48:06,544 --> 00:48:10,617
Ain't got nothing to worry about from me.
I'm cool, homie.

642
00:48:10,784 --> 00:48:12,615
Behold the voice of God.

643
00:48:15,624 --> 00:48:17,600
For those of you
who don't know me officially,

644
00:48:17,624 --> 00:48:19,296
my name is Amanda Waller.

645
00:48:20,624 --> 00:48:23,582
There's an active terrorist event
in Midway City.

646
00:48:23,784 --> 00:48:28,096
I want you to enter the city,
rescue HVT-1, and get them to safety.

647
00:48:28,824 --> 00:48:30,462
I'm sorry. Uh...

648
00:48:30,664 --> 00:48:34,259
For those of us who don't
speak good guy, what is HVT-1?

649
00:48:34,424 --> 00:48:36,344
The only person
that matters in the city,

650
00:48:36,544 --> 00:48:38,136
the one person you can't kill.

651
00:48:39,304 --> 00:48:42,023
Complete the mission,
you get time off your prison sentence.

652
00:48:42,184 --> 00:48:43,936
Fail the mission, you die.

653
00:48:44,104 --> 00:48:47,653
Anything happens to Colonel Flag,
I'll kill every single one of you.

654
00:48:48,784 --> 00:48:50,342
Remember, I'm watching.

655
00:48:51,984 --> 00:48:53,463
I see everything.

656
00:48:56,144 --> 00:48:57,816
There's your pep talk.

657
00:48:58,424 --> 00:49:00,335
Compared to your shit, she killed it.

658
00:49:01,184 --> 00:49:02,333
So that's it?

659
00:49:02,504 --> 00:49:05,382
What, we some kind of Suicide Squad?

660
00:49:05,544 --> 00:49:08,012
I'll notify your next of kin.

661
00:49:09,504 --> 00:49:11,859
Alpha, Bravo team. Mount up!

662
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:19,104
You're late.

663
00:49:45,384 --> 00:49:47,818
This is Katana. She's got my back.

664
00:49:47,984 --> 00:49:50,896
She can cut all of you in half
with one sword stroke,

665
00:49:51,064 --> 00:49:53,532
just like mowing the lawn.

666
00:49:53,744 --> 00:49:55,655
I would advise not getting killed by her.

667
00:49:55,824 --> 00:49:59,055
Her sword traps the souls of its victims.

668
00:49:59,864 --> 00:50:02,219
Harley Quinn. Nice to meet ya.

669
00:50:02,424 --> 00:50:03,424
Love your perfume.

670
00:50:03,584 --> 00:50:05,973
What is that? The stench of death?

671
00:50:09,824 --> 00:50:12,784
Whoa! Easy, cowgirl.
Ain't that kind of a mission. Have a seat.

672
00:50:13,424 --> 00:50:14,743
She seems nice.

673
00:50:34,504 --> 00:50:35,504
Shh.

674
00:50:36,984 --> 00:50:37,984
Hey.

675
00:50:39,464 --> 00:50:40,944
Is he supposed to be green like that?

676
00:50:44,464 --> 00:50:45,464
Oh!

677
00:50:45,784 --> 00:50:47,137
Party foul!

678
00:50:47,944 --> 00:50:49,377
Not cool.

679
00:51:02,304 --> 00:51:04,101
Ooh. Look at the pretty lights!

680
00:51:05,464 --> 00:51:07,341
Are you guys seeing this?

681
00:51:08,704 --> 00:51:09,704
What happened?

682
00:51:11,784 --> 00:51:13,297
Terror attack.

683
00:51:13,464 --> 00:51:16,695
Dirty bombs, bad guys
shooting up the place with AKs.

684
00:51:16,864 --> 00:51:18,820
You know, usual shit.

685
00:51:18,984 --> 00:51:19,984
Right.

686
00:51:20,984 --> 00:51:22,815
Yeah, you're a bad liar.

687
00:51:23,824 --> 00:51:25,000
I don't know if they told you,

688
00:51:25,024 --> 00:51:28,141
but I'm a hitman. I'm not a fireman.
I don't save people.

689
00:51:28,304 --> 00:51:29,817
Anything for a dollar, right?

690
00:51:30,464 --> 00:51:33,297
You know the dark places, too.
Don't act like you don't.

691
00:51:33,464 --> 00:51:35,341
I'm a soldier!

692
00:51:35,504 --> 00:51:38,337
And you're a serial killer
who takes credit cards.

693
00:51:38,504 --> 00:51:42,816
When the shooting starts,
and it will, you'll cut and run.

694
00:51:57,304 --> 00:51:58,862
Six-one is going down.

695
00:51:59,024 --> 00:52:00,901
Six-one is going down hard.

696
00:52:15,184 --> 00:52:16,902
Stand by. Drop the ramp.

697
00:52:25,904 --> 00:52:27,815
Whoo! What a ride!

698
00:52:28,104 --> 00:52:30,140
We're okay. We're okay.
Assets are undamaged.

699
00:52:48,744 --> 00:52:50,735
- Mind games.
- What's that?

700
00:52:50,904 --> 00:52:52,940
All this bomb in the neck crap.

701
00:52:53,824 --> 00:52:54,893
That ain't real, mate.

702
00:52:55,544 --> 00:52:57,784
See, they're trying to trap us
with our own minds, right?

703
00:52:57,864 --> 00:53:01,459
But you look around, we're free, brah.

704
00:53:01,624 --> 00:53:02,624
How do you know this?

705
00:53:02,784 --> 00:53:04,934
Just trust me. I know, all right?
It's a con.

706
00:53:05,144 --> 00:53:08,102
Now I'm going,
because I got a life to live.

707
00:53:08,264 --> 00:53:10,255
Question is, are you coming?

708
00:53:14,384 --> 00:53:16,340
Yeah. Smart!

709
00:53:38,104 --> 00:53:39,104
Hold your fire.

710
00:53:42,104 --> 00:53:43,856
Sorry. It's what I do.

711
00:53:55,184 --> 00:53:56,184
Damn it.

712
00:53:58,104 --> 00:54:00,413
Now that's a killer app!

713
00:54:00,584 --> 00:54:02,142
Okay. You wanna keep playing

714
00:54:02,304 --> 00:54:04,920
the Hollywood Squares version
of "I'll Blow Your Freaking Head Off"?

715
00:54:04,944 --> 00:54:05,944
Are you next?

716
00:54:06,824 --> 00:54:08,098
You tripping, homie.

717
00:54:08,944 --> 00:54:10,582
You next, Deadshot?

718
00:54:13,624 --> 00:54:14,693
You just threatened me?

719
00:54:14,864 --> 00:54:16,263
Oh, yeah.

720
00:54:16,464 --> 00:54:17,977
He just threatened me.

721
00:54:21,704 --> 00:54:23,103
Move.

722
00:54:23,304 --> 00:54:24,862
You got a boyfriend?

723
00:54:28,624 --> 00:54:30,182
All right, I'm gonna kill him.

724
00:54:30,344 --> 00:54:31,480
Well, you better make it quick

725
00:54:31,504 --> 00:54:33,224
'cause he's gonna kill
all of us one by one.

726
00:54:34,024 --> 00:54:36,584
I'm gonna drop him, the sword lady,
five or seven of these SEALs.

727
00:54:36,704 --> 00:54:38,740
After that, I'm gonna need
some help. You down?

728
00:54:38,944 --> 00:54:41,458
Always. What about the shit in our necks?

729
00:54:41,624 --> 00:54:44,297
Your friend's gonna
help us out with that, right?

730
00:54:47,504 --> 00:54:49,574
You're my friend, too.

731
00:54:50,984 --> 00:54:54,181
Stay evil, doll face. Spread the word.

732
00:55:06,504 --> 00:55:07,504
So...

733
00:55:07,664 --> 00:55:09,814
I'm thinking if we move together,

734
00:55:09,984 --> 00:55:12,782
we can kill all these guys
and go our separate ways.

735
00:55:13,064 --> 00:55:14,338
- Yeah?
- Sounds good.

736
00:55:22,344 --> 00:55:23,823
Spread the word.

737
00:55:26,064 --> 00:55:27,463
Psst. Oi. Oi.

738
00:55:30,384 --> 00:55:31,783
We need your help, man.

739
00:55:32,184 --> 00:55:33,617
When the time's right,

740
00:55:33,904 --> 00:55:35,337
you hit Flag with a fireball.

741
00:55:35,984 --> 00:55:39,215
He'll be too busy burning to death
to have a go at us with his phone of doom.

742
00:55:39,784 --> 00:55:40,784
Then what?

743
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:42,983
Then we get out of here.

744
00:55:44,384 --> 00:55:45,453
And do what?

745
00:55:45,824 --> 00:55:47,944
What are you,
bloody Socrates, with all the questions?

746
00:55:47,984 --> 00:55:49,099
Freedom, man.

747
00:55:49,904 --> 00:55:51,542
Freedom! You remember that, don't you?

748
00:55:52,904 --> 00:55:54,424
We're criminals. You know that, right?

749
00:55:54,624 --> 00:55:56,023
Yeah. It's great.

750
00:55:56,344 --> 00:55:57,572
Come on, do the bastard.

751
00:56:00,184 --> 00:56:01,253
Hey, be careful.

752
00:56:01,744 --> 00:56:02,779
He eats people.

753
00:56:02,944 --> 00:56:04,263
Sorry, Mother Superior, what?

754
00:56:04,744 --> 00:56:06,382
He eats people for reals, homie.

755
00:56:06,584 --> 00:56:07,584
He's a cannibal.

756
00:56:08,064 --> 00:56:09,292
Oh.

757
00:56:13,624 --> 00:56:14,739
No.

758
00:56:30,784 --> 00:56:32,304
What did you say to him?

759
00:56:32,464 --> 00:56:34,420
Nothing. Just having a laugh.

760
00:56:35,144 --> 00:56:36,418
No worries.

761
00:56:43,504 --> 00:56:45,824
I'm standing by for follow on tac team.

762
00:56:56,304 --> 00:56:59,102
C2, what is the operational load
of the PLS?

763
00:56:59,304 --> 00:57:00,703
Boss, we got people up here.

764
00:57:01,824 --> 00:57:03,496
I'm on my way.

765
00:57:15,784 --> 00:57:16,784
Shit.

766
00:57:16,944 --> 00:57:18,900
Amanda, we have hostiles up ahead.

767
00:57:19,104 --> 00:57:20,822
Flag, get out of there.

768
00:57:21,024 --> 00:57:23,333
We're not here to fight them.
We know that doesn't work.

769
00:57:23,504 --> 00:57:25,222
Copy that.

770
00:57:25,384 --> 00:57:26,658
We're diverting.

771
00:57:26,864 --> 00:57:29,378
Bump out second squad two blocks east.

772
00:57:29,544 --> 00:57:32,183
We'll pass through you, continue north.

773
00:57:32,344 --> 00:57:33,880
Take Bravo two blocks east.

774
00:57:33,904 --> 00:57:35,840
We'll leapfrog through you
once you're in position.

775
00:57:35,864 --> 00:57:36,864
Copy that.

776
00:57:44,184 --> 00:57:48,496
Hey. I like these odds, mate.
You just say the word.

777
00:57:48,664 --> 00:57:49,664
Yeah.

778
00:57:50,464 --> 00:57:51,579
Come on.

779
00:57:52,024 --> 00:57:53,024
Yeah, uh...

780
00:57:53,224 --> 00:57:54,543
Hold that thought.

781
00:58:03,784 --> 00:58:06,093
Rick, why do they look like that?

782
00:58:06,264 --> 00:58:07,936
Just stay cool.

783
00:58:19,784 --> 00:58:20,819
The hell are they?

784
00:58:21,744 --> 00:58:23,735
You cut and run, I'll blow your head off.

785
00:58:35,784 --> 00:58:36,784
Hit them!

786
00:58:47,064 --> 00:58:48,064
Huh.

787
00:59:33,744 --> 00:59:34,744
Hey.

788
00:59:44,784 --> 00:59:45,784
Ha!

789
01:00:00,664 --> 01:00:01,664
Get off me!

790
01:00:05,944 --> 01:00:07,059
Get off me! Son of a...

791
01:00:11,744 --> 01:00:12,779
Flag!

792
01:00:14,344 --> 01:00:15,640
- Good riddance.
- Harley!

793
01:00:15,664 --> 01:00:17,017
He dies, we die.

794
01:00:29,384 --> 01:00:30,737
- Thanks.
- Shut up.

795
01:00:32,784 --> 01:00:33,933
Backblast, clear!

796
01:01:23,264 --> 01:01:24,379
Pinky.

797
01:01:28,464 --> 01:01:30,580
That's how I cut and run.

798
01:01:38,424 --> 01:01:39,857
Hey.

799
01:01:40,024 --> 01:01:41,024
Hey, come on.

800
01:01:41,264 --> 01:01:43,414
What? I saw it move.

801
01:01:44,384 --> 01:01:46,818
See? It flinched. I think.

802
01:01:47,744 --> 01:01:49,143
Hey, you were some help, princess.

803
01:01:50,384 --> 01:01:51,578
It's better this way.

804
01:01:52,184 --> 01:01:53,184
Trust me.

805
01:01:53,384 --> 01:01:55,102
Oh, yeah, you're the fire bloke, eh?

806
01:01:55,264 --> 01:01:57,459
- Yeah, I was. Yeah.
- Right. Yeah. Hey.

807
01:01:58,784 --> 01:01:59,933
Well, looky here.

808
01:02:00,104 --> 01:02:01,662
Whoo! It's fire.

809
01:02:01,904 --> 01:02:02,904
Whoo!

810
01:02:04,784 --> 01:02:06,900
The brief said terrorists.

811
01:02:07,504 --> 01:02:08,640
You wanna start explaining this?

812
01:02:08,664 --> 01:02:10,344
If I told you, would you believe me?

813
01:02:11,824 --> 01:02:13,382
- What are they?
- I don't know.

814
01:02:13,544 --> 01:02:15,023
That's bullshit.

815
01:02:15,624 --> 01:02:18,013
Thing has on a $3,000 watch.

816
01:02:19,464 --> 01:02:20,783
Is that a person?

817
01:02:21,424 --> 01:02:22,424
It was.

818
01:02:23,264 --> 01:02:24,663
Now it's not.

819
01:02:25,984 --> 01:02:27,019
Hey, don't!

820
01:02:27,664 --> 01:02:28,858
What?

821
01:02:29,024 --> 01:02:30,298
We got a job to do.

822
01:02:33,504 --> 01:02:34,504
We're moving.

823
01:02:37,664 --> 01:02:39,495
Get your boys moving.

824
01:02:41,984 --> 01:02:43,337
Let's go.

825
01:02:52,024 --> 01:02:54,060
Waller,
we're moving on the objective.

826
01:02:54,224 --> 01:02:55,800
We lost contact with Bravo.
You got a visual?

827
01:02:55,824 --> 01:02:56,859
Stand by.

828
01:02:57,024 --> 01:02:59,333
- Anything on the other squad?
- No, ma'am.

829
01:02:59,504 --> 01:03:01,859
Go-7, I need your sensors
on those coordinates.

830
01:03:02,024 --> 01:03:03,024
Flag, it's a negative.

831
01:03:03,184 --> 01:03:06,142
They were engaged when you were,
but we lost them.

832
01:03:43,024 --> 01:03:44,093
Seriously?

833
01:03:44,264 --> 01:03:46,573
The hell is wrong with you people?

834
01:03:46,784 --> 01:03:49,742
We're bad guys. It's what we do.

835
01:04:08,904 --> 01:04:10,895
Hey, Deadshot. I've been thinking.

836
01:04:11,224 --> 01:04:14,261
If we don't come together,
no one's walking out of here alive.

837
01:04:15,904 --> 01:04:16,939
Hmm.

838
01:04:17,144 --> 01:04:18,338
And?

839
01:04:18,784 --> 01:04:20,900
These people respect you.
You got influence.

840
01:04:21,984 --> 01:04:23,781
All right. What's your play right now?

841
01:04:23,944 --> 01:04:25,457
You're a man of your word, right?

842
01:04:28,504 --> 01:04:29,778
I want my mission.

843
01:04:30,264 --> 01:04:32,095
You want your life and your kid back.

844
01:04:33,104 --> 01:04:37,894
You help me keep this Mardi Gras parade
in line and I'll hook you up.

845
01:04:39,784 --> 01:04:41,740
Waller is the puppet master.

846
01:04:42,144 --> 01:04:43,664
You ain't got shit to hook me up with.

847
01:04:43,824 --> 01:04:45,462
I got plenty of my own strings to pull.

848
01:04:45,784 --> 01:04:47,520
You just get them
to the top of that target building

849
01:04:47,544 --> 01:04:49,455
and get my rescuee
on that extraction helo.

850
01:04:50,144 --> 01:04:51,600
And you're gonna make sure I get paid?

851
01:04:51,624 --> 01:04:52,773
And you get paid.

852
01:04:53,944 --> 01:04:55,624
You get paid,
and you get your fresh start.

853
01:05:02,864 --> 01:05:03,864
Take a knee.

854
01:05:09,664 --> 01:05:11,224
Our body's at the top of that building.

855
01:05:11,344 --> 01:05:12,663
We get up there,

856
01:05:12,824 --> 01:05:14,584
pull them out of the vault
they're hiding in.

857
01:05:14,664 --> 01:05:16,416
Helos extract us off the roof.

858
01:05:16,624 --> 01:05:18,182
- It's Miller time.
- Check.

859
01:05:19,384 --> 01:05:21,579
Flag, who's up there?

860
01:05:21,744 --> 01:05:22,960
That's none of your concern.

861
01:05:22,984 --> 01:05:24,880
- Do you know who's up there?
- No.

862
01:05:24,904 --> 01:05:26,132
Is it the President?

863
01:05:26,344 --> 01:05:27,504
It's not the President.

864
01:05:39,544 --> 01:05:40,818
Argh!

865
01:06:01,944 --> 01:06:03,013
Oh, you!

866
01:06:03,184 --> 01:06:05,140
You're not leaving me.
You're not leaving me!

867
01:06:05,344 --> 01:06:07,539
You're a pain in the ass.

868
01:06:10,504 --> 01:06:12,779
I have done everything you said.

869
01:06:12,944 --> 01:06:16,175
Every test, every trial, every initiation.

870
01:06:16,344 --> 01:06:19,142
I have proved I love you. Just accept it.

871
01:06:19,304 --> 01:06:20,817
Got it, got it, got it, got it.

872
01:06:21,184 --> 01:06:25,063
I am not someone who is loved.

873
01:06:26,104 --> 01:06:28,493
I'm an idea.

874
01:06:28,664 --> 01:06:30,894
A state of mind.

875
01:06:31,064 --> 01:06:34,659
I execute my will according to my plan.

876
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:37,782
And you, Doctor...

877
01:06:38,464 --> 01:06:39,760
Are not part of my plan.

878
01:06:39,784 --> 01:06:43,413
Just let me in. I promise...
Let me in! I promise I won't hurt you.

879
01:06:43,584 --> 01:06:44,903
A promise-promise?

880
01:06:45,064 --> 01:06:46,497
Hey, dickface!

881
01:06:47,224 --> 01:06:49,419
Mind screaming at your bitch
somewhere else?

882
01:06:51,264 --> 01:06:53,778
I was gonna say,
"I wouldn't do that if I were you."

883
01:06:57,904 --> 01:06:59,417
Don't hurt me.

884
01:07:00,064 --> 01:07:01,099
I'll be your friend.

885
01:07:05,144 --> 01:07:07,704
Do it. Do it, do it, do it.

886
01:07:07,904 --> 01:07:11,419
My heart scares you, and a gun doesn't?

887
01:07:11,584 --> 01:07:12,653
Do it!

888
01:07:19,024 --> 01:07:22,619
If you weren't so crazy,
I'd think you were insane.

889
01:07:24,264 --> 01:07:26,494
Go away.

890
01:07:29,704 --> 01:07:31,422
Harley, you coming?

891
01:07:45,544 --> 01:07:47,136
Why do you eat people?

892
01:07:51,264 --> 01:07:53,459
Gives me their power.

893
01:07:54,384 --> 01:07:55,419
Would you like to eat me?

894
01:07:57,304 --> 01:07:58,532
Hell, no.

895
01:07:58,824 --> 01:07:59,973
Aw, why not?

896
01:08:00,464 --> 01:08:02,455
I don't want your crazy.

897
01:08:04,184 --> 01:08:06,300
Says the guy who lives in a sewer.

898
01:08:06,504 --> 01:08:08,495
At least I know it's a sewer.

899
01:08:09,224 --> 01:08:10,942
Oh, I get it.

900
01:08:11,344 --> 01:08:13,494
'Cause like, this is a sewer, too,

901
01:08:13,744 --> 01:08:15,974
only with
nice shops and restaurants, right?

902
01:08:16,144 --> 01:08:18,658
- Mmm.
- You hate mankind much?

903
01:08:20,184 --> 01:08:21,333
Let me guess.

904
01:08:22,504 --> 01:08:26,019
Mommy didn't take you to Chuck E. Cheese
on your sixth birthday.

905
01:08:27,104 --> 01:08:28,904
I can recommend a good therapist.

906
01:08:31,624 --> 01:08:32,624
Why?

907
01:08:32,864 --> 01:08:34,217
Because I'm bored.

908
01:08:34,384 --> 01:08:38,423
I need a victim,
a mind to pry apart and spit in.

909
01:08:38,584 --> 01:08:40,859
Leave it, mate.
She's a rabbit hole. Don't fall in.

910
01:08:45,984 --> 01:08:47,861
And here's one now.

911
01:08:49,184 --> 01:08:51,414
Japanese, female.

912
01:08:51,664 --> 01:08:55,816
Mid-20s, 5'5", good health, athletic.

913
01:08:56,104 --> 01:08:57,537
And...

914
01:08:59,224 --> 01:09:00,623
An only child.

915
01:09:01,344 --> 01:09:04,416
With deep-seated father issues.

916
01:09:05,784 --> 01:09:09,538
Daddy wanted a son,
so she has to hide behind a mask.

917
01:09:14,464 --> 01:09:16,261
I am not

918
01:09:17,664 --> 01:09:18,858
hiding.

919
01:09:20,424 --> 01:09:21,857
Now, that was gangster.

920
01:09:22,544 --> 01:09:23,693
Harley.

921
01:09:23,864 --> 01:09:25,720
Why don't you
stop acting like a drunken stripper?

922
01:09:25,744 --> 01:09:27,704
You wanna tell me
what the hell is going on, then?

923
01:09:27,744 --> 01:09:28,744
'Cause...

924
01:09:28,944 --> 01:09:31,139
I smell a rat.

925
01:09:33,184 --> 01:09:35,140
If they don't blow our heads off,

926
01:09:35,464 --> 01:09:37,375
we'll have to
fight our way out of this city.

927
01:09:38,344 --> 01:09:40,733
I need you to
play nice with the other children.

928
01:09:41,024 --> 01:09:44,016
And quietly return to my cage.

929
01:09:44,904 --> 01:09:46,223
Sure, okay.

930
01:09:46,904 --> 01:09:50,101
Hey, that's okay, sellout.
I get it. I get it.

931
01:09:50,384 --> 01:09:52,534
I know how the world works, okay?

932
01:09:53,144 --> 01:09:55,260
And when it comes to the heart,

933
01:09:56,424 --> 01:09:58,142
everyone for themselves, right?

934
01:10:17,984 --> 01:10:19,019
Waller?

935
01:10:19,904 --> 01:10:22,737
We're about to enter the building.
Get that chopper ready.

936
01:10:26,824 --> 01:10:28,344
What do you say we get this over with?

937
01:10:28,464 --> 01:10:30,819
What the hell? Deadshot. Fall back.

938
01:10:36,984 --> 01:10:38,497
You mind if we tag along?

939
01:10:51,984 --> 01:10:54,100
Whoo! Looks like we have
a spot of luck, eh?

940
01:10:55,304 --> 01:10:57,340
Be a walk in the park.

941
01:10:57,504 --> 01:10:59,096
Easy peasy.

942
01:10:59,304 --> 01:11:00,976
Don't make me shoot you.

943
01:11:06,504 --> 01:11:08,017
God damn it. Harley!

944
01:11:08,664 --> 01:11:09,813
Go, go, go, go!

945
01:11:57,904 --> 01:11:59,019
Hey, guys!

946
01:12:05,584 --> 01:12:06,903
Come on. Let's go.

947
01:12:16,264 --> 01:12:19,734
Ma'am. I got motion detectors going off
on the secure floors.

948
01:12:22,784 --> 01:12:24,695
- Flag, they're all around you.
- Hold.

949
01:12:24,864 --> 01:12:26,855
Use extreme caution.

950
01:12:28,624 --> 01:12:30,103
I don't like this, Flag.

951
01:12:31,744 --> 01:12:33,462
I don't like it either.

952
01:12:37,944 --> 01:12:38,944
Pussy.

953
01:12:39,104 --> 01:12:41,220
I will knock your ass out.

954
01:12:41,384 --> 01:12:42,737
I do not care that you're a girl.

955
01:13:33,384 --> 01:13:34,783
They're after Flag again.

956
01:13:35,864 --> 01:13:37,422
Son of a bitch. Get off me.

957
01:13:41,904 --> 01:13:43,656
Circle up. Circle around him.

958
01:13:49,344 --> 01:13:51,414
- Let me fight!
- You die, we die.

959
01:13:54,584 --> 01:13:56,495
Clear! Everyone move out!

960
01:14:11,024 --> 01:14:12,840
- Where you been, homie?
- This ain't my fight!

961
01:14:12,864 --> 01:14:15,617
You know what? You don't stand for shit.
You ain't about shit!

962
01:14:15,784 --> 01:14:16,904
Don't touch me, man!

963
01:14:17,024 --> 01:14:18,320
Don't touch you? What you gonna do?

964
01:14:18,344 --> 01:14:20,320
- Don't touch me!
- I'm touching you! I'm touching you!

965
01:14:20,344 --> 01:14:22,184
- Do something. Do something!
- Don't touch me!

966
01:14:22,344 --> 01:14:23,800
- You wanna see something?
- Oh, yeah, I wanna see...

967
01:14:23,824 --> 01:14:26,024
- You wanna see something?
- Yes, I wanna see something.

968
01:14:49,904 --> 01:14:51,815
I was just trying to get you there.

969
01:14:53,224 --> 01:14:54,543
Phil Jackson. We good, right?

970
01:14:56,904 --> 01:14:59,543
I knew you'd come through.

971
01:15:00,064 --> 01:15:01,577
That shit crazy.

972
01:15:11,704 --> 01:15:12,898
Clear.

973
01:15:26,224 --> 01:15:28,260
I gotta work on my cardio.

974
01:15:38,264 --> 01:15:39,936
Question.

975
01:15:42,344 --> 01:15:44,062
Would you die for me?

976
01:15:46,304 --> 01:15:47,304
Yes.

977
01:15:47,504 --> 01:15:49,062
That's too easy.

978
01:15:50,064 --> 01:15:51,543
Would you...

979
01:15:54,024 --> 01:15:56,060
Would you live for me?

980
01:15:58,024 --> 01:15:59,024
Mmm?

981
01:15:59,264 --> 01:16:00,458
Yes.

982
01:16:01,224 --> 01:16:02,782
Careful.

983
01:16:02,944 --> 01:16:07,620
Do not say this oath thoughtlessly.

984
01:16:09,624 --> 01:16:12,821
Desire becomes surrender.
Surrender becomes power.

985
01:16:16,824 --> 01:16:18,052
Do you want this?

986
01:16:19,384 --> 01:16:20,384
I do.

987
01:16:20,584 --> 01:16:21,937
Say it.

988
01:16:22,104 --> 01:16:24,823
Say it. Say it.

989
01:16:24,984 --> 01:16:27,498
Pretty, pretty, pretty...

990
01:16:27,664 --> 01:16:28,779
Please.

991
01:16:29,944 --> 01:16:31,502
Aw! God, you're so...

992
01:16:32,104 --> 01:16:33,139
Good.

993
01:17:38,824 --> 01:17:40,382
Whoa!

994
01:17:40,824 --> 01:17:42,416
Relax. Just me.

995
01:17:46,584 --> 01:17:48,176
You ever been in love?

996
01:17:50,664 --> 01:17:52,222
Nah. Never.

997
01:17:52,424 --> 01:17:53,698
Bullshit.

998
01:17:53,864 --> 01:17:55,695
You don't kill as many people
as I've killed

999
01:17:55,864 --> 01:17:59,493
and still sleep like a kitten
if you feel shit like love.

1000
01:18:02,224 --> 01:18:04,021
Another textbook sociopath.

1001
01:18:08,224 --> 01:18:10,533
Clear.

1002
01:18:11,744 --> 01:18:12,938
All right, secure the roof.

1003
01:18:13,104 --> 01:18:15,664
Sweep for shooters
so we can bring in our aviation assets.

1004
01:18:15,864 --> 01:18:16,899
Going to the roof.

1005
01:18:23,744 --> 01:18:25,336
Oh. Wait here.

1006
01:18:25,984 --> 01:18:26,984
Please.

1007
01:18:27,184 --> 01:18:29,744
I don't wanna give this dude
a heart attack. Okay?

1008
01:18:30,744 --> 01:18:32,621
Aw, he's embarrassed of us!

1009
01:18:32,784 --> 01:18:34,012
Hey, Flag.

1010
01:18:34,184 --> 01:18:36,493
This dude better cure cancer
after all of this shit.

1011
01:18:43,704 --> 01:18:45,854
You ready? Let's go.

1012
01:18:46,704 --> 01:18:48,774
You wouldn't have made it without them.

1013
01:18:48,944 --> 01:18:51,981
We got lucky. I don't do luck.
I do planning and precision.

1014
01:18:52,144 --> 01:18:54,499
Admit it, Rick. I was right.

1015
01:18:54,664 --> 01:18:57,303
Yeah, I told you to get on the damn truck.
Why'd you stay?

1016
01:18:57,464 --> 01:18:59,216
I was studying your girlfriend.

1017
01:18:59,384 --> 01:19:03,059
She takes an average person,
a yoga mom, an elderly retiree,

1018
01:19:03,224 --> 01:19:06,144
and she turns them into a soldier
who can take a headshot and still fight.

1019
01:19:06,824 --> 01:19:08,462
It's an instant army.

1020
01:19:09,464 --> 01:19:10,692
How'd she do it, Flag?

1021
01:19:11,424 --> 01:19:14,894
How'd she game the system
with you watching her every move?

1022
01:19:17,824 --> 01:19:19,496
I'll accept the consequences.

1023
01:19:20,104 --> 01:19:22,060
I am your consequence.

1024
01:19:22,264 --> 01:19:23,824
You might need to be careful.

1025
01:19:24,344 --> 01:19:26,414
They think we're rescuing Nelson Mandela.

1026
01:19:26,584 --> 01:19:28,097
I can take care of myself.

1027
01:19:28,264 --> 01:19:29,464
Shut it down, wipe the drives.

1028
01:19:29,624 --> 01:19:31,104
- Yes, ma'am.
- Copy that.

1029
01:19:32,504 --> 01:19:34,864
Uh, hey, man. I know you can't hear me
'cause you're trapped

1030
01:19:35,024 --> 01:19:37,538
in your temple of soldierly
self-righteousness,

1031
01:19:37,704 --> 01:19:41,140
but a two-faced dude like you
wouldn't survive a second on the street.

1032
01:19:41,304 --> 01:19:43,181
Oh, says the guy
who shoots people for money.

1033
01:19:43,344 --> 01:19:44,544
My cards is on the table, man.

1034
01:19:44,704 --> 01:19:46,103
It got done, didn't it?

1035
01:19:51,944 --> 01:19:56,256
Damn. That is just a mean lady.

1036
01:19:57,304 --> 01:19:58,896
Yeah. You get used to it.

1037
01:20:00,864 --> 01:20:02,695
And I'm the bad guy?

1038
01:20:06,704 --> 01:20:08,183
That's gangsta.

1039
01:20:09,344 --> 01:20:10,379
What?

1040
01:20:10,544 --> 01:20:12,424
They weren't cleared for any of this.
Any of it.

1041
01:20:12,504 --> 01:20:15,496
Hey, I'm not judging.
I've buried a lot of mistakes, too.

1042
01:20:26,024 --> 01:20:27,218
No way.

1043
01:20:37,304 --> 01:20:38,896
Let's go home.

1044
01:20:39,064 --> 01:20:40,622
Yeah, let's go home.

1045
01:20:41,384 --> 01:20:44,456
That sounds good.
You guys wanna go home? Hmm?

1046
01:20:44,624 --> 01:20:46,615
Or you wanna go back to prison?

1047
01:20:46,784 --> 01:20:48,263
I'm not going back to prison.

1048
01:20:48,424 --> 01:20:51,177
What I'm saying is we kill the pair of 'em
now before they kill us.

1049
01:20:52,624 --> 01:20:54,421
I got this.

1050
01:20:57,384 --> 01:20:59,215
You all made it this far.

1051
01:21:00,264 --> 01:21:03,222
Don't get high-spirited on me
and ruin a good thing.

1052
01:21:19,904 --> 01:21:21,462
I like her.

1053
01:21:25,184 --> 01:21:27,379
Savior One-Zero,
this is Ground Element.

1054
01:21:30,944 --> 01:21:33,777
Savior One-Zero, how copy?

1055
01:21:34,984 --> 01:21:37,259
Savior One-Zero, the LZ's clear.

1056
01:21:43,064 --> 01:21:44,344
Boss, they're not talking to me.

1057
01:21:46,544 --> 01:21:47,579
Our bird's been jacked.

1058
01:21:49,384 --> 01:21:50,384
Light it up!

1059
01:22:16,744 --> 01:22:18,541
What? I got a hickey or something?

1060
01:22:18,704 --> 01:22:20,695
Professor,
could you pick up the pace?

1061
01:22:33,024 --> 01:22:34,059
Harley!

1062
01:22:37,424 --> 01:22:38,698
Hello, baby.

1063
01:22:41,144 --> 01:22:42,144
Kill her!

1064
01:22:43,904 --> 01:22:45,895
Her nanite's disarmed!

1065
01:22:48,384 --> 01:22:49,578
Come on, baby.

1066
01:23:05,144 --> 01:23:06,179
Deadshot,

1067
01:23:07,224 --> 01:23:09,055
shoot that woman right now!

1068
01:23:09,224 --> 01:23:11,101
She ain't do shit to me.

1069
01:23:11,264 --> 01:23:13,334
You're a hitman, right?

1070
01:23:13,504 --> 01:23:14,732
I got a contract.

1071
01:23:14,904 --> 01:23:18,783
Kill Harley Quinn.
Do it for your freedom and your kid.

1072
01:23:20,824 --> 01:23:22,576
Now she dead.

1073
01:24:02,184 --> 01:24:03,333
I missed.

1074
01:24:08,264 --> 01:24:09,264
Good one, mate.

1075
01:24:10,064 --> 01:24:11,543
It's Waller.

1076
01:24:11,744 --> 01:24:15,134
Savior One-Zero's been hijacked.
Shoot it down.

1077
01:24:15,344 --> 01:24:17,300
Roger that, ma'am. Going hot.

1078
01:24:25,544 --> 01:24:26,579
Puddin'!

1079
01:24:31,664 --> 01:24:33,620
You got all dressed up for me?

1080
01:24:33,824 --> 01:24:36,292
Oh, you know I'd do anything for you.

1081
01:24:36,464 --> 01:24:38,978
By the way,
I've got some grape soda on ice,

1082
01:24:39,144 --> 01:24:40,418
and a bear skin rug waiting.

1083
01:24:40,624 --> 01:24:41,624
Yeah?

1084
01:24:42,104 --> 01:24:43,298
Boss, we got a problem!

1085
01:24:43,704 --> 01:24:44,853
Huh?

1086
01:24:49,384 --> 01:24:52,217
- This bird is baked.
- No.

1087
01:24:54,024 --> 01:24:56,333
Okay, honey. It's me and you.

1088
01:24:56,504 --> 01:24:57,732
Let's do it.

1089
01:25:24,424 --> 01:25:25,823
Target destroyed, ma'am.

1090
01:25:25,984 --> 01:25:28,020
Thank you. Now get me off this roof.

1091
01:25:29,024 --> 01:25:30,582
Yes, ma'am. We are inbound.

1092
01:25:34,024 --> 01:25:36,060
The Joker and Harley Quinn are no more.

1093
01:25:41,424 --> 01:25:42,618
You couldn't save her.

1094
01:25:47,104 --> 01:25:48,583
Roger. I see ya.

1095
01:25:51,944 --> 01:25:52,944
Watch your step, ma'am.

1096
01:25:55,384 --> 01:25:58,182
Stand by. I'll send another helo!

1097
01:26:58,864 --> 01:27:00,900
Waller's down.

1098
01:27:01,064 --> 01:27:02,064
It's over.

1099
01:27:02,664 --> 01:27:06,179
Ops just confirmed. She's down. 1 k west.

1100
01:27:08,784 --> 01:27:10,422
Let's go get her.

1101
01:27:15,944 --> 01:27:17,343
The mission's not over.

1102
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:20,701
Nah. It is for me. We had a deal.

1103
01:27:21,024 --> 01:27:23,015
Without Waller, you got nothing.

1104
01:28:08,904 --> 01:28:11,862
Hey, guys. I'm back!

1105
01:28:13,184 --> 01:28:15,573
I missed you all so much.

1106
01:28:16,464 --> 01:28:19,137
We're glad you could make it.

1107
01:28:32,904 --> 01:28:34,895
Hey, craziness.

1108
01:29:20,984 --> 01:29:24,613
With my heart returned,
I can finish my weapon.

1109
01:29:25,224 --> 01:29:28,978
Now tell me how to destroy your armies.

1110
01:29:29,184 --> 01:29:31,061
Do your worst, bitch!

1111
01:29:59,584 --> 01:30:00,624
So let me guess.

1112
01:30:01,824 --> 01:30:04,816
We're going to
the swirling ring of trash in the sky.

1113
01:30:05,304 --> 01:30:06,976
You know, 'cause why wouldn't we?

1114
01:30:09,624 --> 01:30:11,501
When does this end, Flag?

1115
01:30:11,704 --> 01:30:13,217
Load up. We're in for a fight.

1116
01:30:38,344 --> 01:30:41,620
You tell everybody everything.

1117
01:30:42,224 --> 01:30:44,533
Or me and you gonna go right now.

1118
01:30:50,864 --> 01:30:51,864
Three days ago,

1119
01:30:52,024 --> 01:30:54,822
a non-human entity appeared
in the subway station.

1120
01:30:56,304 --> 01:30:58,215
Waller, we're almost there.

1121
01:30:58,384 --> 01:31:01,854
So Waller sent me and a woman
with incredible abilities.

1122
01:31:02,024 --> 01:31:03,855
Enchantress.

1123
01:31:04,864 --> 01:31:06,377
A witch.

1124
01:31:07,424 --> 01:31:10,655
See, nobody could get near this thing,
but the witch could.

1125
01:31:12,744 --> 01:31:13,972
Bomb's ready.

1126
01:31:14,184 --> 01:31:15,742
Set for two seconds.

1127
01:31:15,904 --> 01:31:17,424
You just press the button and drop it.

1128
01:31:21,384 --> 01:31:24,296
Needless to say,
the whole thing was a bad idea.

1129
01:31:24,464 --> 01:31:25,613
She bolted!

1130
01:31:25,784 --> 01:31:27,263
Shit!

1131
01:31:35,144 --> 01:31:37,897
And that's how she escaped from Waller.

1132
01:31:40,264 --> 01:31:41,663
So now you know.

1133
01:31:43,144 --> 01:31:44,975
You can just kill me right now,

1134
01:31:46,424 --> 01:31:47,937
but I'm going to have a drink.

1135
01:31:48,544 --> 01:31:49,943
Hey, Deadshot, I need your help.

1136
01:31:50,544 --> 01:31:53,536
No, sir. You need a miracle.

1137
01:32:25,944 --> 01:32:27,696
What ya having, K.C.?

1138
01:32:28,944 --> 01:32:30,696
Bloody Mary, right?

1139
01:32:32,584 --> 01:32:34,654
Drink dulls the mind.

1140
01:32:35,344 --> 01:32:37,619
K.C., it's the end of the world.

1141
01:32:37,984 --> 01:32:39,542
Have a drink with us.

1142
01:32:40,584 --> 01:32:41,619
Beer.

1143
01:32:41,944 --> 01:32:44,094
There he is. Give the man a beer.

1144
01:32:46,344 --> 01:32:47,823
How about you, hot stuff?

1145
01:32:50,584 --> 01:32:51,619
Water.

1146
01:32:51,904 --> 01:32:53,462
That's a good idea, honey.

1147
01:32:56,064 --> 01:32:57,179
Ninja?

1148
01:32:57,784 --> 01:32:58,784
You want some sake?

1149
01:32:59,624 --> 01:33:00,659
Whiskey.

1150
01:33:01,024 --> 01:33:02,093
Whiskey.

1151
01:33:02,904 --> 01:33:03,973
Okay.

1152
01:33:06,504 --> 01:33:07,504
What am I, 12?

1153
01:33:14,504 --> 01:33:17,655
Here's to honor among thieves.

1154
01:33:18,264 --> 01:33:19,743
I'm not a thief.

1155
01:33:21,624 --> 01:33:23,296
Oh. She's not a thief.

1156
01:33:30,264 --> 01:33:33,336
I actually prefer to think of myself
as an asset relocation specialist.

1157
01:33:33,864 --> 01:33:35,183
Mmm.

1158
01:33:35,624 --> 01:33:38,013
Well, we almost pulled it off

1159
01:33:38,184 --> 01:33:40,903
despite what everybody thought.

1160
01:33:41,824 --> 01:33:43,974
We weren't picked to succeed.
You know that, right?

1161
01:33:45,024 --> 01:33:46,503
We were all chosen to fail.

1162
01:33:46,664 --> 01:33:48,097
Yeah, I know that.

1163
01:33:48,264 --> 01:33:51,461
Worst part of it is, they're going to
blame us for the whole thing.

1164
01:33:51,904 --> 01:33:54,259
And they can't have people
knowing the truth.

1165
01:33:54,864 --> 01:33:56,456
We're the patsies.

1166
01:33:56,624 --> 01:33:57,852
The cover-up.

1167
01:33:59,024 --> 01:34:01,379
Don't forget, we're the bad guys.

1168
01:34:06,624 --> 01:34:10,458
So you gonna tell us now
what your "big deal" with Flag was?

1169
01:34:10,624 --> 01:34:13,696
Same thing Waller offered me, to kill you.

1170
01:34:14,144 --> 01:34:15,941
The chance to be a father.

1171
01:34:16,664 --> 01:34:18,814
Chance at a life outside the shadows.

1172
01:34:20,824 --> 01:34:22,337
I trusted Flag.

1173
01:34:22,904 --> 01:34:25,020
Flag had you
chasing a carrot on a stick, homie.

1174
01:34:25,224 --> 01:34:26,544
You don't... You don't know that?

1175
01:34:27,064 --> 01:34:28,213
I love this guy.

1176
01:34:28,584 --> 01:34:29,812
You played yourself, dawg.

1177
01:34:30,224 --> 01:34:31,862
Bitch, I'm having a drink.

1178
01:34:32,424 --> 01:34:34,892
I'm breathing fresh air.

1179
01:34:35,264 --> 01:34:36,458
And, uh,

1180
01:34:36,624 --> 01:34:38,774
for two sweet seconds...

1181
01:34:39,824 --> 01:34:41,542
I had hope.

1182
01:34:42,104 --> 01:34:43,776
You had hope, huh?

1183
01:34:45,504 --> 01:34:47,734
Hope don't stop
the wheel from turning, my brother.

1184
01:34:48,024 --> 01:34:49,696
Hmm. You preaching?

1185
01:34:49,904 --> 01:34:51,735
It's coming back around for you.

1186
01:34:52,264 --> 01:34:54,937
How many people you killed, man?

1187
01:34:55,544 --> 01:34:57,819
You don't ask nobody
no question like that, ese.

1188
01:34:57,984 --> 01:35:00,737
You ain't ever whacked down no women.

1189
01:35:00,904 --> 01:35:02,383
No kids.

1190
01:35:03,904 --> 01:35:05,496
I don't kill women or children.

1191
01:35:06,024 --> 01:35:07,024
I do.

1192
01:35:10,504 --> 01:35:13,098
See, I was born with the Devil's gift.

1193
01:35:13,264 --> 01:35:16,620
I kept it hidden
for most of my life, but...

1194
01:35:17,104 --> 01:35:19,743
The older I got, the stronger it got.

1195
01:35:19,904 --> 01:35:21,656
So I started using it.

1196
01:35:22,944 --> 01:35:24,616
For business, you know.

1197
01:35:25,464 --> 01:35:27,932
The more power on the street I got,
the more fire power I got.

1198
01:35:28,144 --> 01:35:29,504
Like, that shit went hand in hand.

1199
01:35:29,544 --> 01:35:32,104
You know? One was feeding the other.

1200
01:35:33,104 --> 01:35:35,254
Ain't nobody tell me no.

1201
01:35:36,424 --> 01:35:37,937
Except my old lady.

1202
01:35:40,504 --> 01:35:42,893
You know, she used to, uh, pray for me.

1203
01:35:43,064 --> 01:35:44,064
You're welcome.

1204
01:35:46,464 --> 01:35:47,692
Even when I didn't want it.

1205
01:35:58,344 --> 01:36:00,300
God didn't give me this.

1206
01:36:01,104 --> 01:36:03,493
Why should he take it away?

1207
01:36:04,424 --> 01:36:05,493
Hey.

1208
01:36:07,784 --> 01:36:08,819
This is our home.

1209
01:36:08,984 --> 01:36:10,464
You put that back where you found it.

1210
01:36:10,544 --> 01:36:12,023
I'm taking my kids to Mom's.

1211
01:36:12,184 --> 01:36:14,175
You ain't taking my kids nowhere!

1212
01:36:14,344 --> 01:36:17,575
See, when I get mad, I lose control.
You know, I just...

1213
01:36:18,864 --> 01:36:19,864
I don't know what I do...

1214
01:36:26,864 --> 01:36:28,502
...till it's done.

1215
01:36:43,104 --> 01:36:44,457
And the kids?

1216
01:36:47,864 --> 01:36:49,217
He killed them.

1217
01:36:53,264 --> 01:36:54,617
Didn't you?

1218
01:37:02,824 --> 01:37:04,416
Own that shit.

1219
01:37:05,384 --> 01:37:06,384
Own it!

1220
01:37:06,544 --> 01:37:09,058
What'd you think was gonna happen? Huh?

1221
01:37:09,224 --> 01:37:10,896
Hey, Harley. Come on.

1222
01:37:11,064 --> 01:37:12,782
What, you were just...

1223
01:37:12,944 --> 01:37:14,536
Thinking you can have a happy family

1224
01:37:14,704 --> 01:37:17,457
and coach little leagues,
and make car payments?

1225
01:37:17,624 --> 01:37:19,342
Normal's a setting on the dryer.

1226
01:37:19,544 --> 01:37:21,978
People like us, we don't get normal!

1227
01:37:22,144 --> 01:37:24,339
Why is it always a knife fight

1228
01:37:24,504 --> 01:37:27,223
every single time you open your mouth?

1229
01:37:28,744 --> 01:37:32,259
You know, outside you're amazing.

1230
01:37:33,824 --> 01:37:36,543
But inside, you're ugly.

1231
01:37:36,704 --> 01:37:38,456
We all are.

1232
01:37:38,624 --> 01:37:41,934
We all are! Except for him.

1233
01:37:43,984 --> 01:37:45,622
He's ugly on the outside, too.

1234
01:37:45,824 --> 01:37:47,894
Not me, shorty.

1235
01:37:51,944 --> 01:37:53,775
I'm beautiful.

1236
01:37:54,344 --> 01:37:56,539
Yeah, you are.

1237
01:38:06,504 --> 01:38:08,017
We don't want you here.

1238
01:38:15,624 --> 01:38:19,458
You get to the part in that binder
saying I was sleeping with her?

1239
01:38:20,784 --> 01:38:22,012
Yeah.

1240
01:38:23,384 --> 01:38:26,137
I never been with a witch before.
What's that like?

1241
01:38:29,384 --> 01:38:32,694
Apparently, that's why the creatures
chase him all the time.

1242
01:38:32,864 --> 01:38:35,742
'Cause, uh, the witch is scared of him.

1243
01:38:35,904 --> 01:38:37,815
The only woman I ever cared about

1244
01:38:38,384 --> 01:38:40,944
is trapped inside that monster.

1245
01:38:41,104 --> 01:38:43,664
If I don't stop the witch, it's over.

1246
01:38:43,824 --> 01:38:45,337
Everything is over.

1247
01:38:45,504 --> 01:38:47,222
Everything.

1248
01:38:50,424 --> 01:38:51,424
You're free to go.

1249
01:39:05,984 --> 01:39:07,656
Your daughter writes you every day.

1250
01:39:11,904 --> 01:39:13,701
Every single day.

1251
01:39:29,504 --> 01:39:31,301
You had these the whole time?

1252
01:39:32,864 --> 01:39:36,300
You had letters from my daughter
the whole time?

1253
01:39:40,544 --> 01:39:41,863
I'm gonna get you there.

1254
01:39:43,064 --> 01:39:44,702
And you're gonna end this.

1255
01:39:44,864 --> 01:39:47,173
I'm gonna carry your ass if I have to.

1256
01:39:48,504 --> 01:39:51,780
'Cause this shit is gonna be
like a chapter in the Bible.

1257
01:39:52,344 --> 01:39:54,574
Everybody's gonna know what we did.

1258
01:39:55,224 --> 01:40:00,218
And my daughter is gonna know
that her daddy is not a piece of shit.

1259
01:40:09,904 --> 01:40:11,417
I'll come.

1260
01:40:15,264 --> 01:40:16,663
What?

1261
01:40:16,824 --> 01:40:18,223
You got something better to do?

1262
01:40:18,384 --> 01:40:19,897
Come on!

1263
01:40:22,024 --> 01:40:23,093
Pussies.

1264
01:40:58,624 --> 01:41:01,013
We think that thing's a weapon.

1265
01:41:01,224 --> 01:41:02,293
Here. Lower.

1266
01:41:10,024 --> 01:41:11,901
We gotta take out the big one.

1267
01:41:14,664 --> 01:41:17,895
I left a big ass demo charge
down there in that subway.

1268
01:41:19,344 --> 01:41:22,416
There's a flooded tunnel,
leads right underneath that building.

1269
01:41:22,624 --> 01:41:27,015
SEALs, they can recover the charge,
swim in underneath that thing's feet.

1270
01:41:27,184 --> 01:41:30,096
We get in its face and distract the hell
out of that son of a bitch

1271
01:41:30,264 --> 01:41:31,624
so the swimmers can blow the bomb.

1272
01:41:33,504 --> 01:41:35,415
That's how we take it out.

1273
01:41:46,064 --> 01:41:47,816
I'm going with ya.

1274
01:41:49,664 --> 01:41:51,097
We got this.

1275
01:41:51,264 --> 01:41:53,300
I'm not asking, bro.

1276
01:41:56,824 --> 01:41:59,019
I live underground.

1277
01:41:59,184 --> 01:42:01,493
Y'all are just tourists.

1278
01:42:26,544 --> 01:42:28,978
The man who killed her husband
used that sword.

1279
01:42:30,664 --> 01:42:32,894
His soul's trapped inside of it.

1280
01:42:33,624 --> 01:42:35,296
She talks to him.

1281
01:42:36,024 --> 01:42:37,377
Hey, well,

1282
01:42:37,544 --> 01:42:39,774
you know what they say
about the crazy ones.

1283
01:42:41,344 --> 01:42:42,344
Huh?

1284
01:42:49,904 --> 01:42:51,053
Let's do this.

1285
01:43:28,944 --> 01:43:30,343
You must really love this girl.

1286
01:43:34,904 --> 01:43:37,941
Man, I thought love was bullshit.
Dead serious.

1287
01:43:39,544 --> 01:43:42,138
Desire, mutual benefit, whatever.

1288
01:43:42,744 --> 01:43:45,622
I mean, I get that, but actual love?

1289
01:43:46,024 --> 01:43:47,935
I rated that with UFOs.

1290
01:43:48,824 --> 01:43:51,384
Lot of believers, no proof.

1291
01:43:54,824 --> 01:43:56,542
And then I met June.

1292
01:43:58,464 --> 01:44:00,136
Do what you gotta do.

1293
01:44:01,824 --> 01:44:03,098
I got your back.

1294
01:44:14,384 --> 01:44:15,744
You gonna fight with us?

1295
01:44:16,664 --> 01:44:18,620
What if I lose control?

1296
01:44:18,784 --> 01:44:20,740
Then maybe we'll have a chance.

1297
01:44:33,184 --> 01:44:34,184
Duck in.

1298
01:44:47,224 --> 01:44:50,739
Hey, everyone can see
all this trippy magic stuff, right?

1299
01:44:51,144 --> 01:44:52,702
Yeah. Why?

1300
01:44:52,864 --> 01:44:54,741
I'm off my meds.

1301
01:44:56,344 --> 01:44:57,904
So that's your old lady, huh?

1302
01:44:58,464 --> 01:44:59,658
Yeah.

1303
01:44:59,824 --> 01:45:01,701
Well, you need to handle
this shit, all right?

1304
01:45:01,864 --> 01:45:05,539
Get up there, smack on her ass,
tell her, "Knock this shit off."

1305
01:45:05,704 --> 01:45:07,854
I do not think that'd be wise.

1306
01:45:08,024 --> 01:45:10,015
I'm gonna draw out the big one.

1307
01:45:10,224 --> 01:45:12,658
My boys will detonate the bomb
underneath him.

1308
01:45:17,064 --> 01:45:19,532
You know, we should get a drink sometime.

1309
01:45:20,384 --> 01:45:23,342
I've been waiting for you all night.

1310
01:45:24,664 --> 01:45:28,577
Step out of the shadows. I won't bite.

1311
01:45:31,224 --> 01:45:32,339
Hmm.

1312
01:45:32,504 --> 01:45:34,335
What the hell? Grab her.

1313
01:45:35,984 --> 01:45:38,179
Why are you here?

1314
01:45:38,344 --> 01:45:41,495
Because the soldier led you?

1315
01:45:41,664 --> 01:45:43,222
And all for Waller.

1316
01:45:43,424 --> 01:45:46,382
Why do you serve those who cage you?

1317
01:45:46,584 --> 01:45:48,859
I am your ally.

1318
01:45:49,024 --> 01:45:51,458
And I know what you want.

1319
01:45:51,624 --> 01:45:54,502
Exactly what you want.

1320
01:46:36,224 --> 01:46:37,782
Baby. Baby.

1321
01:46:38,744 --> 01:46:41,463
Baby, it's just a nightmare.

1322
01:46:42,744 --> 01:46:44,462
It's just a bad dream.

1323
01:46:45,104 --> 01:46:46,298
I'm here.

1324
01:46:57,104 --> 01:46:58,219
Miss me?

1325
01:47:05,664 --> 01:47:09,054
I'll put the kids to sleep
and then maybe we can kick it?

1326
01:47:10,904 --> 01:47:11,904
Yeah?

1327
01:47:13,864 --> 01:47:17,903
I can't change what I did.
And neither can you!

1328
01:47:18,104 --> 01:47:19,696
He married me!

1329
01:47:21,344 --> 01:47:22,663
It's not real.

1330
01:47:23,264 --> 01:47:24,379
I killed the Bat.

1331
01:47:24,544 --> 01:47:26,136
Nah, homie. You don't want that.

1332
01:47:26,744 --> 01:47:28,382
What? I want that.

1333
01:47:28,544 --> 01:47:30,104
She trying to play games with you, man.

1334
01:47:30,264 --> 01:47:31,982
- It's not real!
- He's right.

1335
01:47:32,824 --> 01:47:34,018
It's not real.

1336
01:47:36,784 --> 01:47:39,252
How long have you been able to see?

1337
01:47:39,984 --> 01:47:41,383
My whole life.

1338
01:47:42,864 --> 01:47:44,456
You can't have them.

1339
01:47:44,624 --> 01:47:45,898
These are my people right here.

1340
01:47:46,064 --> 01:47:47,861
But it is our time.

1341
01:47:48,024 --> 01:47:52,859
The sun is setting, and the magic rises.
The metahumans are a sign of change.

1342
01:47:54,544 --> 01:47:57,616
Lady, you are evil!

1343
01:48:02,784 --> 01:48:03,853
Oh, wow.

1344
01:48:07,104 --> 01:48:08,253
Uh-oh.

1345
01:48:09,104 --> 01:48:10,332
Who's this?

1346
01:48:10,944 --> 01:48:12,855
- It's gonna be bad!
- We should run.

1347
01:48:24,904 --> 01:48:26,462
GQ, come in. We're in position.

1348
01:48:35,944 --> 01:48:38,424
We gotta get him in that corner.
That's where the bomb will be.

1349
01:48:38,544 --> 01:48:40,262
I'll do it! I'll get him there.

1350
01:48:54,264 --> 01:48:56,224
I lost one family.
I ain't gonna lose another one.

1351
01:48:56,264 --> 01:48:57,583
Look, think it through.

1352
01:48:57,784 --> 01:49:01,094
I got this.
Let me show you what I really am.

1353
01:49:02,784 --> 01:49:03,784
Over here!

1354
01:49:46,504 --> 01:49:47,504
Go!

1355
01:50:01,944 --> 01:50:03,423
Rick, in position. Standing by.

1356
01:50:03,584 --> 01:50:05,415
Diablo, drive him into the corner!

1357
01:50:20,264 --> 01:50:21,333
- Get him, mate!
- Come on.

1358
01:50:23,384 --> 01:50:24,703
Yeah, do it!

1359
01:50:34,984 --> 01:50:36,861
Diablo, get clear! Get outta there!

1360
01:50:37,024 --> 01:50:38,457
Blow it!

1361
01:50:41,624 --> 01:50:42,693
Blow it.

1362
01:50:45,384 --> 01:50:47,898
- Now, GQ. Now.
- No!

1363
01:50:49,544 --> 01:50:50,772
Everybody, down!

1364
01:51:28,824 --> 01:51:29,893
You next.

1365
01:51:31,584 --> 01:51:34,621
My spell is complete.

1366
01:51:34,784 --> 01:51:38,572
Once you and your armies are gone,
my darkness will spread across this world.

1367
01:51:38,744 --> 01:51:42,180
And it will be mine to rule.

1368
01:51:57,544 --> 01:51:59,341
That was our main satellite uplink.

1369
01:52:04,464 --> 01:52:06,280
How did this witch even know
how to target this thing?

1370
01:52:06,304 --> 01:52:08,135
It's a secret facility.

1371
01:52:13,024 --> 01:52:14,696
You got a move here, Flag?

1372
01:52:14,864 --> 01:52:16,900
We gotta cut her heart out.

1373
01:52:48,224 --> 01:52:49,304
While we're fighting,

1374
01:52:49,384 --> 01:52:51,659
that thing's laying waste
to the whole damn world.

1375
01:52:58,904 --> 01:53:00,178
Where is she?

1376
01:53:01,184 --> 01:53:03,064
I don't know.

1377
01:53:06,824 --> 01:53:07,824
Hey.

1378
01:53:14,184 --> 01:53:15,412
Look out. Look out!

1379
01:53:38,264 --> 01:53:39,264
Uh-oh.

1380
01:53:39,464 --> 01:53:40,692
Sorry.

1381
01:53:46,504 --> 01:53:47,903
Flag!

1382
01:54:22,224 --> 01:54:23,498
Enough!

1383
01:54:27,504 --> 01:54:32,703
Of all who have faced me,
you have earned mercy.

1384
01:54:32,864 --> 01:54:34,741
For the last time,

1385
01:54:35,424 --> 01:54:38,621
join me, or die.

1386
01:54:40,944 --> 01:54:43,538
I'm not much of a joiner,

1387
01:54:44,784 --> 01:54:46,740
but maybe we should.

1388
01:54:46,904 --> 01:54:48,303
Hey!

1389
01:54:48,464 --> 01:54:50,102
She's trying to take over the world.

1390
01:54:50,304 --> 01:54:51,419
So?

1391
01:54:52,104 --> 01:54:55,255
What's the world ever done for us, anyway?
It hates us.

1392
01:54:56,224 --> 01:54:57,703
Hey, Harley!

1393
01:55:01,144 --> 01:55:03,817
Hey, lady? Um...

1394
01:55:05,744 --> 01:55:07,621
I lost my Puddin'.

1395
01:55:09,224 --> 01:55:10,896
But you can get him back, right?

1396
01:55:11,824 --> 01:55:13,974
I can, my dear.

1397
01:55:14,424 --> 01:55:17,097
Anything you want.

1398
01:55:20,064 --> 01:55:21,179
You promise?

1399
01:55:21,344 --> 01:55:23,062
Yes, child.

1400
01:55:24,824 --> 01:55:26,143
You need only bow

1401
01:55:28,024 --> 01:55:31,300
and serve beneath my feet.

1402
01:55:36,184 --> 01:55:38,459
I like what you're sellin', lady.

1403
01:55:39,184 --> 01:55:42,620
There's just one teeny problem.

1404
01:55:44,184 --> 01:55:45,264
You messed with my friends.

1405
01:55:51,344 --> 01:55:53,574
Her heart's out! We can end this!

1406
01:55:57,864 --> 01:55:59,820
Hey, Croc!

1407
01:56:02,624 --> 01:56:03,852
Harley!

1408
01:56:48,544 --> 01:56:50,694
Please, Daddy. Don't do it.

1409
01:56:52,224 --> 01:56:56,058
The only way for us to be together
is if you don't pull the trigger.

1410
01:56:56,984 --> 01:56:58,576
Daddy, I love you.

1411
01:56:59,504 --> 01:57:01,460
Please, don't do this.

1412
01:57:56,584 --> 01:57:57,664
That was a great shot, man.

1413
01:57:57,864 --> 01:58:00,059
Hey, I don't do hugs. I'm not a hugger.

1414
01:58:00,224 --> 01:58:02,863
I'm not a hugger. All right?

1415
01:58:09,584 --> 01:58:11,973
Let me join my brother.

1416
01:58:12,984 --> 01:58:14,178
Katana, no!

1417
01:58:19,224 --> 01:58:20,418
Give me that.

1418
01:58:22,504 --> 01:58:25,302
You bring June back. You bring her back.

1419
01:58:25,464 --> 01:58:27,420
She's not coming back.

1420
01:58:27,584 --> 01:58:30,223
I'll crush this. Do you hear me?

1421
01:58:30,384 --> 01:58:32,261
You bring June back or I'll crush this!

1422
01:58:32,424 --> 01:58:33,652
Go ahead.

1423
01:58:34,664 --> 01:58:36,461
You don't have the balls.

1424
01:59:29,544 --> 01:59:30,579
Hey, Flag.

1425
01:59:40,184 --> 01:59:41,253
June!

1426
01:59:50,824 --> 01:59:52,496
She's gone.

1427
01:59:52,664 --> 01:59:55,940
I thought I killed you.

1428
01:59:56,984 --> 01:59:59,452
Y'all don't mind,

1429
01:59:59,624 --> 02:00:02,263
I got me a sewer to crawl back into.

1430
02:00:02,424 --> 02:00:04,938
Yeah, and I got some business to handle
back in Gotham.

1431
02:00:05,104 --> 02:00:06,776
I'm going to hotwire a car. Need a ride?

1432
02:00:06,944 --> 02:00:08,218
Your ass is not driving.

1433
02:00:08,384 --> 02:00:09,419
Why not?

1434
02:00:12,184 --> 02:00:13,981
How are you not dead?

1435
02:00:14,624 --> 02:00:16,296
We just saved the world.

1436
02:00:17,104 --> 02:00:18,981
A "thank you" would be nice.

1437
02:00:19,624 --> 02:00:20,739
Thank you.

1438
02:00:21,704 --> 02:00:22,739
You're welcome.

1439
02:00:22,904 --> 02:00:24,664
So, we did all of this
and we don't get shit?

1440
02:00:24,824 --> 02:00:27,338
Ten years off your prison sentences.

1441
02:00:30,664 --> 02:00:33,497
Nah, that's not enough.
I'm seeing my daughter.

1442
02:00:35,984 --> 02:00:37,303
That can be arranged.

1443
02:00:38,624 --> 02:00:39,943
Any other requests?

1444
02:00:40,584 --> 02:00:42,142
Ooh. An espresso machine.

1445
02:00:43,144 --> 02:00:44,782
BET.

1446
02:00:45,464 --> 02:00:48,103
Ten years off a triple life sentence?

1447
02:00:48,264 --> 02:00:50,016
Darling, I'm walking
out of here a free man

1448
02:00:50,184 --> 02:00:52,015
or we're going
to start having some real fun.

1449
02:00:52,184 --> 02:00:54,095
Why don't we have some fun?

1450
02:01:03,984 --> 02:01:06,544
You're trying to figure out this length.

1451
02:01:07,504 --> 02:01:08,653
That's the hypotenuse.

1452
02:01:08,824 --> 02:01:10,655
So, you have to know this angle.

1453
02:01:10,824 --> 02:01:15,056
Okay. So, if you're up here,
like in a building,

1454
02:01:15,224 --> 02:01:18,341
and you shoot a man
down here on the street,

1455
02:01:18,504 --> 02:01:20,620
that's how far the bullet actually goes?

1456
02:01:21,504 --> 02:01:23,495
Yeah. That's right.

1457
02:01:23,664 --> 02:01:25,320
You are so smart. Right.

1458
02:01:25,344 --> 02:01:27,983
The hypotenuse. Good one. Um...

1459
02:01:28,864 --> 02:01:30,664
So, that would make you
have to know the angle

1460
02:01:30,704 --> 02:01:33,013
between the building and the sidewalk.

1461
02:01:33,184 --> 02:01:34,697
You got to know that angle.

1462
02:01:34,864 --> 02:01:37,583
No, I mean, in real life,
you have variables.

1463
02:01:37,744 --> 02:01:39,024
You know, you got rifling twist.

1464
02:01:39,184 --> 02:01:41,539
You got chamber pressure.
You got bullet weight.

1465
02:01:42,544 --> 02:01:44,500
Some shots you'll even
have to take the curvature

1466
02:01:44,664 --> 02:01:46,680
of the Earth in with the...

1467
02:01:46,704 --> 02:01:47,704
It's time.

1468
02:01:49,224 --> 02:01:50,418
...wind effect.

1469
02:01:51,744 --> 02:01:53,814
You know, there's a lot of variables

1470
02:01:55,064 --> 02:01:56,543
in the street.

1471
02:02:00,384 --> 02:02:01,533
I gotta go.

1472
02:02:02,544 --> 02:02:03,863
Are you coming back?

1473
02:02:05,384 --> 02:02:06,419
Yeah.

1474
02:02:06,584 --> 02:02:09,178
I'm working it out. All right?

1475
02:02:09,344 --> 02:02:13,303
You know, I promised my friends
that I would just, you know, go,

1476
02:02:13,464 --> 02:02:15,898
without killing them all.

1477
02:02:16,064 --> 02:02:17,213
Bring it in.

1478
02:02:20,544 --> 02:02:21,738
I love you, Daddy.

1479
02:02:21,904 --> 02:02:22,904
Hmm.

1480
02:02:24,584 --> 02:02:25,778
I love you.

1481
02:02:51,904 --> 02:02:54,259
Hey! Let me out!

1482
02:02:54,424 --> 02:02:56,301
Let me out of here right now!

1483
02:02:56,464 --> 02:02:59,422
Hey! You feel that? Yeah.

1484
02:03:00,304 --> 02:03:02,215
Let me out of here, darling, please.

1485
02:03:02,424 --> 02:03:03,760
Please, I'm begging you, seriously.

1486
02:03:03,784 --> 02:03:07,094
Listen to me. Have you got a car?
Because I'm a brilliant driver.

1487
02:03:07,304 --> 02:03:08,657
Come on!

1488
02:04:03,624 --> 02:04:05,137
Puddin'!

1489
02:04:07,464 --> 02:04:09,136
Let's go home.

1490
02:06:33,544 --> 02:06:35,933
This is crown jewels here,
Mr. Wayne.

1491
02:06:37,024 --> 02:06:38,980
And you do understand my legal exposure.

1492
02:06:39,144 --> 02:06:41,180
If anyone knew what I procured for you...

1493
02:06:41,344 --> 02:06:44,541
Listen, I can keep a secret, okay?

1494
02:06:44,704 --> 02:06:45,932
What do you want?

1495
02:06:46,144 --> 02:06:48,704
People are asking questions
about Midway City.

1496
02:06:48,864 --> 02:06:50,544
The kind of people
who can get the answers.

1497
02:06:50,624 --> 02:06:53,661
And if they can get those answers,
my head will be on a pike.

1498
02:06:53,864 --> 02:06:56,458
Consider yourself under my protection.

1499
02:06:56,624 --> 02:06:57,898
If you deliver.

1500
02:07:14,184 --> 02:07:15,663
Why, Mr. Wayne?

1501
02:07:18,024 --> 02:07:19,582
Just like to make friends.

1502
02:07:21,224 --> 02:07:22,360
That's the difference between us.

1503
02:07:22,384 --> 02:07:24,693
You believe in friendship.
I believe in leverage.

1504
02:07:26,104 --> 02:07:27,139
Good night.

1505
02:07:27,304 --> 02:07:29,295
You look tired.

1506
02:07:29,464 --> 02:07:31,580
You should stop working nights.

1507
02:07:32,544 --> 02:07:36,537
You should shut it down,
or my friends and I'll do it for you.
