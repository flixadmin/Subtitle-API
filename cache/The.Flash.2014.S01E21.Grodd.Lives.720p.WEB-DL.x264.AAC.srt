00:00:01,766 --> 00:00:05,336
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:07,272
When I was a child,
I saw my mother killed

4
00:00:07,274 --> 00:00:08,273
by something impossible.

5
00:00:08,275 --> 00:00:09,774
Run, Barry, run!

6
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:12,210
My father went to prison
for her murder.

7
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:16,214
Then an accident made me
the impossible.

8
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:19,017
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,

9
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,953
but secretly,
I use my speed to fight crime

10
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:23,788
and find others like me.

11
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,191
And one day, I'll find
who killed my mother...

12
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:27,492
Mom!

13
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:28,790
...and get justice for my father.

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,400
I am The Flash.

15
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:32,897
Previously on<i> The Flash...</i>

16
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:33,898
Iris West.

17
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,100
Eddie.

18
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:39,737
The Man in Yellow,
he took Eddie.

19
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:42,073
I promise
I'll find him, okay?

20
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:45,800
Barry.

21
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:49,681
Think about your best friend.

22
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:51,517
It could be your wife,
your father,

23
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:53,652
maybe someone you grew up with.

24
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:55,554
It's the person you can't wait
to talk to

25
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:57,022
at the end of the day.

26
00:00:57,024 --> 00:00:59,224
The person who knows
everything about you,

27
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:01,193
who roots for you.

28
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:04,096
Now imagine you discover
your best friend has a secret.

29
00:01:04,098 --> 00:01:05,097
No, not a secret.

30
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,433
A universe of secrets.

31
00:01:07,435 --> 00:01:09,001
Would you confront him?

32
00:01:09,003 --> 00:01:11,036
Would you stay silent?

33
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:14,506
Either way, you know nothing
will ever be the same again.

34
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:22,014
Where is Thawne?

35
00:01:22,016 --> 00:01:23,782
He took some personal time.

36
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:26,618
Yeah, Eddie's been going through
some stuff, Captain.

37
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,620
Yeah, aren't we all?

38
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:30,055
You got anything
on these gold store robberies?

39
00:01:30,057 --> 00:01:31,790
Perps hit up two more
in the last week,

40
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:33,459
- and we still got nothing.
- We're working on it.

41
00:01:33,461 --> 00:01:35,294
Just waiting on some
final results from the lab.

42
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:36,762
All right, well,
pick up the pace.

43
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:38,230
And see if somebody
can contact The Flash.

44
00:01:38,232 --> 00:01:40,899
Maybe he can help
speed things up.

45
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:42,234
You know what I mean.

46
00:01:42,236 --> 00:01:45,537
Get going.

47
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:46,939
- Anything?
- No.

48
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:49,475
I mean, I've looked everywhere.

49
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:52,277
Keep looking.

50
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,345
Of course.
Yeah.

51
00:01:57,884 --> 00:02:00,752
- Hey.
- Hey.

52
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:02,554
Uh, I'm heading out
right now.

53
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:04,256
- What's up?
- Something happened.

54
00:02:04,258 --> 00:02:05,257
And I'm not supposed
to say anything,

55
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:08,327
but I couldn't keep quiet.

56
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:09,728
What happened?

57
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,396
The Man in Yellow,

58
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:13,398
he took Eddie
right in front of me.

59
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,668
Oh, my God.

60
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,137
Are you okay?

61
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:19,771
No, no.
Not at all.

62
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:21,640
- No, I...
- The Flash was there.

63
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,008
He told me to go home
and not to talk to anyone

64
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,811
because he would fix it,
but he hasn't.

65
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:27,613
I think the police should be
out there searching for Eddie.

66
00:02:27,615 --> 00:02:29,248
No, Iris...

67
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,516
My dad needs to know
the truth.

68
00:02:30,518 --> 00:02:36,088
Uh, I think
that The Flash is right.

69
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,657
Joe and the cops,
they're no match

70
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:39,791
for The Man in Yellow, Iris.

71
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:41,793
They would just get hurt.

72
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:44,129
So you think The Flash
is out there

73
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:47,032
right now,
searching for Eddie?

74
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:51,036
I'm sure he's doing
everything he can to find him.

75
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:55,841
Yeah, well,
I'm finding it pretty hard

76
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:58,777
to trust The Flash right now.

77
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:00,879
Well, then, trust me.

78
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:03,315
Okay?

79
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:07,686
Look, I'm so sorry
about all of this. I...

80
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,855
Everything is gonna be okay.

81
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:11,156
I have to go.

82
00:03:17,665 --> 00:03:18,964
Okay, back it up.

83
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:28,240
Move out.

84
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,549
Get down!

85
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:50,996
Hey.

86
00:03:50,998 --> 00:03:52,764
You planning on keeping
all those cameras

87
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:54,533
Wells used to spy on us?

88
00:03:54,535 --> 00:03:56,001
That's kind of creepy,
don't you think?

89
00:03:56,003 --> 00:03:58,170
First rule
of mechanical engineering, dude.

90
00:03:58,172 --> 00:03:59,705
Never waste good tech.

91
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:06,044
Central City Gold Reserve's
under attack.

92
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:08,513
Gold? That's the case
Singh wants us on.

93
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,015
- Mm.
- I'll be right back.

94
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:26,698
You picked a bad day for this,
pal.

95
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,792
What was that?

96
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,163
Your eye movement is normal.

97
00:04:58,165 --> 00:05:00,132
No signs of neurological damage.

98
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:01,600
Do you think the thief

99
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:03,835
might have been a meta-human
who put the whammie on you

100
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:04,836
or something?

101
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:06,171
I-I don't know.

102
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:09,174
When Rainbow Raider
got in my head,

103
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:12,077
all I felt was anger.

104
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,912
But this was not that.

105
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:17,916
This was
just overwhelming fear.

106
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:20,619
Hmm.

107
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:24,289
Looks like when you went down,
the thief got disoriented too.

108
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:27,259
Maybe we both got whammied.

109
00:05:27,261 --> 00:05:28,827
Then you know how it feels.

110
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:40,505
Hi, Barry.

111
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,676
Or should I say The Flash?

112
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,859
This is one of the few times

113
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,661
I would not want to be
Barry Allen.

114
00:06:02,663 --> 00:06:04,696
I wonder what he's gonna say.

115
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:07,532
We should absolutely
not listen in.

116
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:11,803
It's none of our business.

117
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:13,972
But The Flash is our business.

118
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:15,707
And Iris did just find out
that Barry's The Flash.

119
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,310
So by transitive property,
Barry and Iris are our business.

120
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:26,718
I... Wait.
How did you find out?

121
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,156
When I touched
The Flash the other night,

122
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:34,393
I felt a jolt of electricity.

123
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:36,428
The only other time I have ever
felt anything like that

124
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:40,999
was when you were in a coma
after the accident.

125
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,903
I can't believe
I didn't figure it out sooner.

126
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:49,007
I can only imagine how angry
you are.

127
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:51,910
I'm not angry, Barry.

128
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:55,080
I'm just disappointed.

129
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:57,616
Okay.

130
00:06:57,618 --> 00:06:59,584
Does Eddie know?

131
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,223
Yes, he does.

132
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:06,858
Is that why he got kidnapped?

133
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,961
No, I don't know why Wells
took Eddie. I...

134
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:12,764
Dr. Wells is The Man in Yellow?

135
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:17,602
Everything he's been doing,
helping me...

136
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,639
it was all a lie.

137
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:23,375
Wells killed my mom.

138
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:29,381
- Is he gonna kill Eddie?
- No, he's not.

139
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:30,615
I'm gonna get Eddie back,
I swear.

140
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,384
Yeah, The Flash said
the same thing.

141
00:07:32,386 --> 00:07:34,586
Look, Iris,
you have to believe me, I...

142
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:36,488
There were so many times
I wanted to tell you.

143
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,256
You were the first person
I wanted to tell,

144
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:41,726
but everything started
getting crazy,

145
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:42,961
and I thought maybe Joe
was right and I shouldn't say...

146
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,262
Wait, wait, wait.

147
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:46,398
You're telling me
that my dad knew

148
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,500
and he told you
not to tell me?

149
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:51,102
He was trying to protect you.

150
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:52,971
We both were.

151
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:57,476
Yeah, well, maybe it's time
you both stopped.

152
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:05,484
Yeah, uh-huh.

153
00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:08,186
Yeah, if we could get
another shipment of the, uh,

154
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:11,623
computers in here...

155
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,825
Yeah, I don't think that had
anything to do with us.

156
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:14,826
Nope.

157
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:34,379
Don't suppose
you brought lunch?

158
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,552
Did you know
that human beings

159
00:08:40,554 --> 00:08:44,122
can survive up to two months

160
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:46,825
without food?

161
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:50,529
Is that how long you're planning
on keeping me here?

162
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:54,366
You know...

163
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,401
I doubt it'll come to that.

164
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:02,974
You want to tell me
what we're doing down here?

165
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:03,676
No.

166
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:10,315
You told me we're related,
that you're from the future.

167
00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:13,051
Prove it.

168
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:18,490
Yeah, I don't have to prove
anything to anyone.

169
00:09:18,492 --> 00:09:20,592
Well, I think
you're full of crap.

170
00:09:20,594 --> 00:09:22,427
And whatever
you're trying to do,

171
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:24,669
you're not gonna get away
with it because The Flash is...

172
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,399
Stop talking.

173
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:52,190
I heard you talked to Barry.

174
00:09:55,628 --> 00:10:01,099
So this is what my cold shoulder
treatment feels like.

175
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:06,805
Look...

176
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:10,642
baby, the way
I went about things, maybe...

177
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:14,079
No.
I was wrong.

178
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:17,716
I was just trying
to keep you safe.

179
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:20,952
You know, that excuse is getting
really old.

180
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,988
First it was
the police academy,

181
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,490
and then it was dating Eddie,
and now this.

182
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:28,927
Sweetheart, you know what
The Man in Yellow is capable of.

183
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:31,997
He killed cops.
He killed Mason Bridge.

184
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:35,066
Wells killed Mason?

185
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:37,235
And you're covering that up?

186
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:40,972
No. No.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

187
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,107
If the world finds out
about Wells,

188
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:43,441
they find out about Barry.

189
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:44,976
I'm trying
to keep him safe too.

190
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,479
Did you ever stop to think that
looping me in

191
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:48,847
would keep me safe?

192
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:50,582
That if I knew
what was going on out there,

193
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:52,684
I could prepare for it?

194
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:54,953
Maybe I could've helped you
and Barry put the bad guys away

195
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:56,655
instead of being in the way.

196
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:58,623
Believe me, I asked myself
that question every single day.

197
00:10:58,625 --> 00:10:59,691
Every time
you posted something new

198
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:01,259
about The Flash on your blog...

199
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:03,094
Dad, it's not just
about Barry being The Flash.

200
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:06,131
You knew how he felt about me
for God knows how long,

201
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:07,499
and you didn't
tell me that either.

202
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:10,502
That wasn't for me to tell,
Iris.

203
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:13,104
Well, you know what, if any
of you had been honest with me,

204
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:15,173
maybe Eddie would still
be here.

205
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,775
He wouldn't have gotten involved
in all of this

206
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:18,176
if I hadn't been dating him.

207
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,378
Are you saying if you had known
how Barry felt...

208
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,114
What I am saying is that
what happened to Eddie

209
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:25,517
is your fault.

210
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:30,355
This is work.

211
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:33,058
We can finish this talk.

212
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,726
Talking.

213
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:35,994
Yeah, that'll be new.

214
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,237
Yeah, boss?

215
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:53,478
I just got a call from Joe.

216
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,480
The Central City Gold Reserve
is about to transport

217
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:59,184
$300 million in gold bars
to their Coast City vault.

218
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:00,752
Singh told Joe they think
the Man in the Mask

219
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:02,487
is gonna make a play for it.

220
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:03,688
Okay, but we still don't know
if he's responsible

221
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,424
for those weird images
you saw.

222
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:09,427
How are they transporting
the gold?

223
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:25,510
Sorry, no more ice cream.

224
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:27,946
But your music's playing.

225
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:30,348
Yeah, it means we're out.

226
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,252
Come on.

227
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,020
You might want to kill
the music.

228
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:38,957
We don't want any kids around
if our thief shows up.

229
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:01,446
Whoa, the truck just got hit
by a land mine.

230
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:02,614
Is Joe okay?

231
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:03,615
We don't know yet.

232
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:18,129
Freeze!
Drop your weapon!

233
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,664
Don't make me do this.

234
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:34,512
You okay?

235
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:36,948
Yeah. You?

236
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,083
I didn't want you
to have to shoot him again.

237
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:40,351
And I'm having
a pretty bad day.

238
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:42,821
So is this guy.

239
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:45,757
Let's see what Goldfinger
has to say for himself.

240
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:56,100
General Eiling?

241
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:10,215
What is wrong with him?

242
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:12,050
I pulled a bullet
out of his shoulder.

243
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:13,384
Which should hurt like hell.

244
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:15,620
And it didn't even seem like
he felt it.

245
00:14:15,622 --> 00:14:17,856
I did a complete body scan,
and otherwise,

246
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:19,624
General Eiling
is perfectly healthy.

247
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:22,727
So why is he just standing there
like a robot?

248
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:24,629
I just got off the phone
with Argus.

249
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:27,398
Officially, Eiling is
on administrative leave.

250
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,800
Unofficially?

251
00:14:28,802 --> 00:14:30,401
I spoke with Diggle's wife,
Lyla,

252
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:31,870
and she said Eiling's
been missing

253
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:33,838
for the past three months

254
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,206
and Argus is covering up
for it.

255
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,374
Makes sense.

256
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:37,976
Last time I saw the general

257
00:14:37,978 --> 00:14:39,978
was when Ronnie and I
broke Professor Stein

258
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,479
out of that military facility.

259
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:43,381
I'm sure
they're covering that up too.

260
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,550
So where has he been since then?

261
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:49,721
General Eiling, why were you
trying to rob the gold reserve?

262
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:55,894
Maybe he's in some kind
of a trance?

263
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:59,063
General, do you remember me?

264
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,734
Flash.

265
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:05,603
Whoa, how does he know
you're The Flash?

266
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:08,773
I don't know.

267
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:09,774
General...

268
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:13,111
Eiling not here.

269
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,782
Eiling bad.

270
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,519
Maybe it's some kind
of psychotic break

271
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:24,589
presenting itself as
dissociative identity disorder.

272
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:26,791
Caitlin.

273
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:29,627
Caitlin good.

274
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:32,397
Oh, uh, thank you?

275
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,400
Mm.
Forget multiple personalities.

276
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:37,568
You guys have seen
<i>The Exorcist,</i> right?

277
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:40,204
You and your movies.

278
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:41,472
Keep talking to him.

279
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:43,374
He seems to respond to you.

280
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:47,278
Uh, why is Eiling bad?

281
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:51,916
Eiling hurt me.

282
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:56,220
I hurt Eiling.

283
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:03,061
Okay, uh,
so if you're not Eiling,

284
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:04,896
then who are you?

285
00:16:04,898 --> 00:16:06,831
I...

286
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,833
Am...

287
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:11,302
Grodd.

288
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:14,405
Fear... me.

289
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:20,311
What is a Grodd?

290
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:31,489
Oh, Grodd is a gorilla.

291
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,758
Five years ago, Eiling and Wells
were working on a project

292
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,794
to expand soldiers' cognitive
abilities during battle.

293
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:38,629
What we didn't realize
is that Eiling

294
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:41,265
was trying to create soldiers
with psychic abilities.

295
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:42,834
What do you mean "psychic"?

296
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:45,003
Eiling was trying to create
these super-soldiers

297
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:47,372
with telepathic
and telekinetic capabilities.

298
00:16:47,374 --> 00:16:49,941
But when Dr. Wells found out
about the terrible experiments

299
00:16:49,943 --> 00:16:52,710
that Eiling was doing,
he shut down the entire project.

300
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:55,213
So our psycho-killer
has a soft spot for animals.

301
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:56,214
That's sweet.

302
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:59,183
What happened to Grodd?

303
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,019
We don't know.

304
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:02,520
After the Particle Accelerator
exploded,

305
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:05,857
I went down to check on him,
and his cage was empty.

306
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,392
So he could have been
affected

307
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:09,560
by the same energy
that hit Barry?

308
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:12,697
When the dark matter hit Grodd,
all the drugs and serums

309
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:16,200
that Eiling injected him with
could've activated.

310
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:20,038
Maybe the Accelerator explosion
created a meta-gorilla.

311
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,839
And I think we know
what happens

312
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:24,008
when a super-intelligent ape
who's pissed off at humans

313
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,410
escapes captivity.

314
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:28,646
Cisco's right
about the first part.

315
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:31,416
This is the first brain scan
that I did on Grodd.

316
00:17:31,418 --> 00:17:34,185
Whoa. His primary motor cortex
and Broca's area

317
00:17:34,187 --> 00:17:36,054
are lit up
like a Christmas tree.

318
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:37,855
From Eiling's experiments.

319
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:40,892
And this is the brain scan
that I just did on Eiling.

320
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:43,094
His brain is lit up
in the exact same way.

321
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:46,264
So Grodd and Eiling
are connected somehow?

322
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:49,934
I think that somehow, Grodd
is transmitting neural signals

323
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:51,936
to Eiling's
primary motor cortex.

324
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:53,404
Mind control, telepathy...

325
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,740
who knows what Grodd
is capable of now?

326
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:59,043
What do we think Grodd wants?
Revenge?

327
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:01,946
I do not like the fact
that Wells rescued Grodd.

328
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:03,781
I don't think
it's a coincidence

329
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:05,283
that this gorilla shows up
at the very same time

330
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:06,751
we're looking for Wells.

331
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:08,753
Grodd and Wells always
did have a special bond.

332
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:10,755
It wouldn't surprise me
if Wells was using Grodd

333
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:12,223
to distract us.

334
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:15,093
If we find Grodd,
we find Wells.

335
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:16,227
If we find Wells...

336
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:19,297
We find Eddie.

337
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:21,632
And I'm gonna help.

338
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:25,703
Know anything about gorillas?

339
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:27,772
I just might.

340
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,907
There have been reports
of some sort of animal

341
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:31,042
down in the sewers.

342
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:35,413
Mm. Alligators.
C.H.U.D.s.

343
00:18:35,415 --> 00:18:37,815
R.O.U.S.es?

344
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:41,119
Am I the only one
who watches movies around here?

345
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:44,655
Uh, a few months ago,
two sewer workers went missing.

346
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:46,257
The search party
reported hearing

347
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:49,293
strange animal-like noises
down in the tunnels.

348
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,129
Where exactly did
they go missing?

349
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:53,931
Uh, Fifth Avenue
and Tenth Street.

350
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:55,433
There's an access point
to the sewers

351
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:57,301
about two blocks east
of that intersection.

352
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,070
I'll start there.

353
00:18:59,072 --> 00:19:00,838
Not alone.
I'm coming too.

354
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,275
Huh, wading through miles
of rats, roaches,

355
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:08,913
and human excrement...
count me out.

356
00:19:08,915 --> 00:19:10,581
Count me in.

357
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,183
He's your monkey.

358
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:29,167
Cisco, take the rest
of these flares,

359
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:31,135
light them, drop them as we go.

360
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:32,770
It's our path back.

361
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:34,305
Give me that banana.

362
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,976
Okay.

363
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:41,879
- Stay close.
- Definitely.

364
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:45,383
Not going anywhere.

365
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:55,326
Thanks for sticking up
for me.

366
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:57,228
Of course.

367
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:00,665
For what it's worth,
Barry feels really terrible

368
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:02,233
about lying to you.

369
00:20:02,235 --> 00:20:05,169
He should.

370
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:08,172
You lied too.

371
00:20:08,174 --> 00:20:10,341
Your fiancé?

372
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:12,310
Ronnie. Yes.

373
00:20:12,312 --> 00:20:16,214
Uh, I thought he died in the
Particle Accelerator explosion,

374
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:19,083
but turns out he just...

375
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:22,153
caught on fire.

376
00:20:22,155 --> 00:20:24,388
Oh.

377
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,057
But he's okay?

378
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:28,192
Yeah. He is.

379
00:20:28,194 --> 00:20:29,594
Good. I'm glad.

380
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:40,204
I can't believe I'm down here

381
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:41,606
looking
for a supernatural gorilla.

382
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:43,174
I'm terrified
of regular gorillas.

383
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,346
What was that?

384
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:51,916
Oh, oh.

385
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,792
Whoa.

386
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:04,762
Hey, hey, guys, look at this.

387
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:08,966
Incredible.

388
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:10,434
Looks like
we're in the right place.

389
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:17,642
Somebody want to tell me
what we're looking at here?

390
00:21:17,644 --> 00:21:19,143
Grodd.

391
00:21:19,145 --> 00:21:21,379
He's evolving.

392
00:21:21,381 --> 00:21:23,314
He's getting smarter.

393
00:21:23,316 --> 00:21:25,816
Getting smarter. Great.

394
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:37,128
If I hadn't seen
<i>Jurassic Park,</i>

395
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,797
I wouldn't be nearly
as frightened right now.

396
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:47,438
So if he's getting smarter,

397
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,974
you think he might be getting
bigger too?

398
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,149
That must have been
a truck passing over, right?

399
00:22:01,587 --> 00:22:03,654
Cisco?

400
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:12,029
Barry!

401
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,841
- We got to get out of here.
- Barry's out cold.

402
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:28,679
Joe!

403
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:30,581
Dad!

404
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:24,335
Wh-what are you doing to me?

405
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,272
Help!

406
00:23:28,274 --> 00:23:31,342
Cisco, help me!

407
00:23:31,344 --> 00:23:34,278
No help here.

408
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:38,582
I can hear you in my head.
You are telepathic.

409
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:42,753
Please.

410
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:45,689
Please.

411
00:23:45,691 --> 00:23:48,526
No, no, no!

412
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:58,769
Father hate gun.

413
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:00,538
Father.

414
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:03,541
Father, you mean...
you mean Wells.

415
00:24:03,543 --> 00:24:06,744
Wells?
Is that what you mean?

416
00:24:06,746 --> 00:24:07,978
Where is he?

417
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,448
Not here.

418
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,051
Wait, wait, wait.
Here.

419
00:24:14,053 --> 00:24:15,152
Is this what you want?

420
00:24:15,154 --> 00:24:16,320
You can have it.

421
00:24:16,322 --> 00:24:17,822
It's yours.

422
00:24:22,462 --> 00:24:25,729
Grodd hate banana.

423
00:24:25,731 --> 00:24:28,933
Please, please.

424
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:45,616
You're experiencing
a spike of activity

425
00:24:45,618 --> 00:24:47,685
in your primary motor cortex.

426
00:24:47,687 --> 00:24:50,521
It's the same thing
we saw in Eiling.

427
00:24:50,523 --> 00:24:54,625
The images you saw were some
kind of psychic attack by Grodd.

428
00:24:54,627 --> 00:24:57,595
First Eddie gets taken
by The Man in Yellow,

429
00:24:57,597 --> 00:24:59,029
and now my dad...

430
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:00,264
We're gonna save both of them,
Iris.

431
00:25:00,266 --> 00:25:01,966
- I promise you.
- Hold up.

432
00:25:01,968 --> 00:25:04,134
I put a tracker in the tranq
dart you shot Grodd with.

433
00:25:04,136 --> 00:25:05,135
- As soon as it activates...
- No, Cisco.

434
00:25:05,137 --> 00:25:06,704
I can't wait for that.

435
00:25:06,706 --> 00:25:08,639
I will search every inch
of that sewer if I have to.

436
00:25:08,641 --> 00:25:10,541
And what happens
if you find them?

437
00:25:10,543 --> 00:25:12,810
What happens if Grodd
takes over your mind

438
00:25:12,812 --> 00:25:14,011
the same way he did with Eiling?

439
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:15,179
I don't... I mean...

440
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:17,114
Can you guys
build me something?

441
00:25:17,116 --> 00:25:20,284
Some kind of tech
so he can't get into my head?

442
00:25:20,286 --> 00:25:23,721
I don't know.

443
00:25:23,723 --> 00:25:27,191
Maybe if Dr. Wells were here.

444
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:29,693
I don't understand.

445
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:32,563
Every day you guys
figure out a way to help people.

446
00:25:32,565 --> 00:25:34,832
All of The Flash's powers
and all of this equipment,

447
00:25:34,834 --> 00:25:36,634
and you can't save Eddie
and my dad?

448
00:25:42,308 --> 00:25:43,908
We'll figure something out.

449
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,142
Fast.

450
00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:50,514
Iris.

451
00:25:50,516 --> 00:25:51,982
I can't get that sound
out of my head.

452
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:53,884
My dad screaming.

453
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:56,253
Why did he insist on going
down there with you?

454
00:25:56,255 --> 00:25:57,922
He's always preaching
about being safe,

455
00:25:57,924 --> 00:26:01,358
but not once does he think about
running into danger himself.

456
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,660
- Iris...
- No, Barry.

457
00:26:02,662 --> 00:26:05,095
He's just a regular cop.

458
00:26:05,097 --> 00:26:08,933
He is not some meta-human
with superpowers.

459
00:26:08,935 --> 00:26:10,901
He's not you.

460
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:13,571
You're right, he's not me.

461
00:26:13,573 --> 00:26:15,372
And this isn't his fault.

462
00:26:15,374 --> 00:26:17,875
None of this is his fault.

463
00:26:17,877 --> 00:26:20,010
Look, yes, maybe Joe told me

464
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:21,745
not to tell you
that I was The Flash,

465
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:23,213
but I didn't have to listen.

466
00:26:23,215 --> 00:26:25,416
I could've told you...
a hundred times

467
00:26:25,418 --> 00:26:28,619
I could've told you,
and I didn't.

468
00:26:28,621 --> 00:26:30,287
Yes, I should've.

469
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:31,555
So you're right to be mad.

470
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:33,290
But don't be mad at your dad.

471
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:35,459
Be mad at me.

472
00:26:35,461 --> 00:26:37,061
Okay.

473
00:26:37,063 --> 00:26:38,596
Okay, then explain to me

474
00:26:38,598 --> 00:26:40,631
how the person I thought
I knew better than anyone

475
00:26:40,633 --> 00:26:43,133
has been keeping secrets
from me?

476
00:26:43,135 --> 00:26:46,103
Big, life-changing secrets?

477
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:48,606
You were supposed to be
my best friend, Barry.

478
00:26:48,608 --> 00:26:50,074
I am your best friend.

479
00:26:50,076 --> 00:26:52,543
How can you say that
when the most important things

480
00:26:52,545 --> 00:26:54,111
in your life,
the things that matter the most,

481
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:55,746
the things that
you're supposed to share,

482
00:26:55,748 --> 00:26:57,715
you kept all of them from me?

483
00:26:57,717 --> 00:27:00,818
You lied to me
about everything.

484
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:03,120
I know, Iris.
Look, I know.

485
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:07,124
But you haven't been
entirely honest with me either.

486
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:09,627
What?
What are you talking about?

487
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:11,929
At Christmas,
when I told you how I felt,

488
00:27:11,931 --> 00:27:13,931
you said that you didn't feel
the same way.

489
00:27:13,933 --> 00:27:15,899
But I just feel like...

490
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:18,636
I don't know,
maybe things aren't that simple.

491
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:24,742
Am I wrong?

492
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:34,818
I'm gonna check
on Cisco and Caitlin.

493
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:46,864
You know they're going
to find me.

494
00:27:46,866 --> 00:27:50,367
And you. You're not as smart
as you think you are.

495
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:53,037
Oh, really? 'Cause I'm
a genius where I come from.

496
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,938
Imagine how smart
that makes me here.

497
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,007
- 'Cause you're from the future?
- Hmm.

498
00:27:57,009 --> 00:28:00,210
With a name like Eobard,
I guess you'd have to be.

499
00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:02,613
No, Eobard is
a distinguished name

500
00:28:02,615 --> 00:28:05,616
for a distinguished member
of a distinguished family.

501
00:28:05,618 --> 00:28:08,819
Depressing to think all of my
descendants are as crazy as you.

502
00:28:08,821 --> 00:28:10,654
Oh, no, no, no.

503
00:28:10,656 --> 00:28:14,692
No, the Thawne bloodline
is chock-full

504
00:28:14,694 --> 00:28:16,493
of influential politicians,
scientists,

505
00:28:16,495 --> 00:28:18,462
Captains of industry.

506
00:28:18,464 --> 00:28:23,400
Failures such as yourself
are just the exception.

507
00:28:23,402 --> 00:28:26,704
And what exactly
makes me such a failure?

508
00:28:26,706 --> 00:28:30,174
Tough question, Eddie.

509
00:28:30,176 --> 00:28:31,742
Where to start?

510
00:28:31,744 --> 00:28:34,978
Oh, how about your career
as a police detective?

511
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,980
It's spectacularly uneventful.

512
00:28:36,982 --> 00:28:39,550
Yeah.
Well, we'll see.

513
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,552
No, we have seen.

514
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:44,154
I have seen.

515
00:28:44,156 --> 00:28:45,656
I am from the future.

516
00:28:45,658 --> 00:28:48,325
And you are the only Thawne

517
00:28:48,327 --> 00:28:52,429
to be all but forgotten
by history.

518
00:28:52,431 --> 00:28:55,032
Waste of a life,
waste of a man.

519
00:28:55,034 --> 00:28:56,533
And...

520
00:28:56,535 --> 00:28:59,269
Oh, no.

521
00:28:59,271 --> 00:29:01,605
You don't even get the girl.

522
00:29:01,607 --> 00:29:03,907
What are you talking about?

523
00:29:11,117 --> 00:29:16,887
Observe, if you will,
the byline.

524
00:29:16,889 --> 00:29:21,425
Barry marries Iris
and not you.

525
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:24,895
We're just gonna have to give
this ring

526
00:29:24,897 --> 00:29:27,197
back to Grandma Agnes.

527
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:32,035
You, Eddie,
won't be needing it.

528
00:29:35,708 --> 00:29:37,741
An anti-telepathy strip.

529
00:29:37,743 --> 00:29:39,710
It uses magnetic resonance
to neutralize

530
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:41,779
any foreign
neurological stimulus.

531
00:29:41,781 --> 00:29:44,581
So it'll protect Barry
from being mind-controlled?

532
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:46,817
That's the hope,
but we have no way of knowing

533
00:29:46,819 --> 00:29:49,486
if it actually works.

534
00:29:49,488 --> 00:29:51,255
It'll work.

535
00:29:51,257 --> 00:29:54,391
The tracker just came online.

536
00:29:54,393 --> 00:29:56,193
We have Grodd's location.

537
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:00,497
Iris...

538
00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:03,834
I want you to know, all the
times I imagined you being here,

539
00:30:03,836 --> 00:30:05,903
it was not like this.

540
00:30:05,905 --> 00:30:08,138
Get my dad back.

541
00:30:19,251 --> 00:30:21,952
Barry, what's your ETA?

542
00:30:21,954 --> 00:30:23,253
All right.

543
00:30:23,255 --> 00:30:25,289
I'm in position.

544
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:27,925
Wait for my signal.

545
00:30:27,927 --> 00:30:29,159
So the red, that's Barry?

546
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:30,327
- Yes.
- And the blue?

547
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:33,597
Is Grodd.

548
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:36,433
Okay. Here goes nothing.

549
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:12,169
The steam's working.
Grodd's on the move.

550
00:31:12,171 --> 00:31:14,037
I don't understand.
What is the plan?

551
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:17,541
He's maneuvering Grodd into
a tunnel 5.3 miles from Barry.

552
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:19,009
So Barry can do what?

553
00:31:19,011 --> 00:31:20,911
Same thing he did to Girder.

554
00:31:20,913 --> 00:31:23,247
Supersonic punch, baby.

555
00:31:23,249 --> 00:31:24,982
Hit it!

556
00:31:58,216 --> 00:31:59,950
The supersonic punch failed.

557
00:31:59,952 --> 00:32:01,585
Uh-oh.
Here we go.

558
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:06,456
It's okay, Cisco.

559
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:07,958
The headset's working.

560
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,460
Yes. Okay, uh,
try some speed punches on him.

561
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:16,099
This isn't working.

562
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:17,134
Okay, what if you try...

563
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:22,940
Barry!

564
00:32:31,717 --> 00:32:32,749
- Barry!
- Oh, no.

565
00:32:32,751 --> 00:32:34,151
The headset's offline.

566
00:32:34,153 --> 00:32:35,713
Sounded like it impacted
with something.

567
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:48,165
Ah!

568
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:50,600
Human. Weak.

569
00:32:50,602 --> 00:32:52,336
Barry's brain activity
is off the charts.

570
00:32:52,338 --> 00:32:53,337
It's way worse
than last time.

571
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:54,738
What's happening to him?

572
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,739
Grodd's attacking him
psychically.

573
00:32:55,741 --> 00:32:57,074
He's paralyzed.

574
00:32:57,076 --> 00:32:59,609
Come on.
There's a service train coming.

575
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,148
Do something please!

576
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,450
I can't stop the train.

577
00:33:06,452 --> 00:33:09,252
Barry, you have
to get out of there now.

578
00:33:12,524 --> 00:33:15,425
What do we do?

579
00:33:15,427 --> 00:33:16,827
Barry, listen to me, okay?

580
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:19,096
You have to concentrate
on my voice.

581
00:33:19,098 --> 00:33:21,098
Whatever is happening to you,
you have to fight it.

582
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:28,538
I know you can do this.
I know how strong you are.

583
00:33:30,109 --> 00:33:31,274
Stand up to Grodd.

584
00:33:31,276 --> 00:33:32,876
You can do this.

585
00:33:32,878 --> 00:33:35,112
Please.

586
00:33:38,951 --> 00:33:41,518
Barry, do it for me.

587
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:54,965
Iris.

588
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:27,597
Joe.

589
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,167
Barry.

590
00:34:30,169 --> 00:34:33,603
Please get me out of here.

591
00:34:33,605 --> 00:34:35,338
Barry!

592
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:38,208
I'm bringing him home.

593
00:34:57,895 --> 00:34:59,930
Mr. Allen,

594
00:34:59,932 --> 00:35:01,765
how nice of you to visit.

595
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:04,534
Exactly how long do you intend
to keep me prisoner?

596
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,707
Your brain scan's normal,

597
00:35:10,709 --> 00:35:13,110
which means Grodd is no longer
controlling you.

598
00:35:13,112 --> 00:35:15,145
This prison is for meta-humans,

599
00:35:15,147 --> 00:35:16,980
so you're free to go.

600
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,922
You will get what's coming
to you eventually.

601
00:35:25,924 --> 00:35:28,959
I am not ashamed of my actions,
Mr. Allen.

602
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:31,661
You've seen what these
meta-humans are capable of.

603
00:35:31,663 --> 00:35:34,464
Soon, your prison
won't be enough.

604
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:36,566
Not all meta-humans
are dangerous.

605
00:35:36,568 --> 00:35:39,836
Oh, you're afraid that I know
you're The Flash?

606
00:35:41,607 --> 00:35:43,907
Don't get your tights in
a twist; I've known for months.

607
00:35:43,909 --> 00:35:46,810
I wanted to come after you,
I would've done it by now.

608
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:49,346
But you think
you're gonna need me.

609
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:55,318
Harrison Wells turned me over
to that beast.

610
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,521
He used me
like a damn puppet.

611
00:35:57,523 --> 00:36:01,024
So like it or not, we have
a common enemy, you and I.

612
00:36:01,026 --> 00:36:03,693
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have a gorilla to hunt.

613
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,933
I said be still.

614
00:36:09,935 --> 00:36:12,469
You have three fractured ribs.

615
00:36:12,471 --> 00:36:13,870
I'll be fine.

616
00:36:13,872 --> 00:36:16,006
Dad, you need to rest.

617
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:20,210
I can't believe Grodd
became so violent.

618
00:36:20,212 --> 00:36:22,045
What was his lair like?

619
00:36:22,047 --> 00:36:24,381
Did he eat the banana?
Does he like<i> King Kong?</i>

620
00:36:24,383 --> 00:36:26,683
He's more of a
<i>Planet of the Apes</i> kind of ape?

621
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:28,018
Uh, terrifying.

622
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,019
No.

623
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:30,654
And I didn't ask.

624
00:36:30,656 --> 00:36:32,189
Mm.

625
00:36:32,191 --> 00:36:34,257
Do you mind if I talk
to my daughter alone?

626
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:43,366
When I was with that gorilla,

627
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:47,337
I thought,
"I'm gonna die down here."

628
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:52,142
And all I could think about was
how you and me were in a fight.

629
00:36:52,144 --> 00:36:56,012
Dad, I was so afraid that
something would happen to you.

630
00:36:56,014 --> 00:37:00,517
My life started
when you were born,

631
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:05,589
and sometimes
my incredible love for you,

632
00:37:05,591 --> 00:37:08,858
it blinds me, and I forget...

633
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:14,731
I forget what
a brilliant young woman you are,

634
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:20,704
how you're capable of making
your own decisions.

635
00:37:20,706 --> 00:37:25,875
Daddy, I know that everything
that you do is out of love.

636
00:37:25,877 --> 00:37:29,346
So love me enough
to always tell me the truth.

637
00:37:29,348 --> 00:37:31,081
- Yeah?
- Deal. Deal.

638
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:34,451
Okay.
Come here.

639
00:37:34,453 --> 00:37:35,452
- Ow!
- Oh!

640
00:37:35,454 --> 00:37:36,720
- Oh.
- Oh, my bad.

641
00:37:36,722 --> 00:37:40,357
Oh, my bad.

642
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:43,059
Maybe it's a good thing
we didn't catch Grodd.

643
00:37:43,061 --> 00:37:44,527
Where would we put him?

644
00:37:44,529 --> 00:37:46,029
I mean, the pipeline
isn't exactly equipped

645
00:37:46,031 --> 00:37:50,400
to hold a super-intelligent,
telepathic gorilla.

646
00:37:50,402 --> 00:37:54,771
Joe mentioned that
Grodd called Wells "Father."

647
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:57,907
And Wells must have ordered
Grodd to come after us.

648
00:37:57,909 --> 00:38:00,710
It's why Grodd didn't kill Joe.

649
00:38:00,712 --> 00:38:02,312
I think Joe is right.

650
00:38:02,314 --> 00:38:05,715
Everything Grodd did,
it was just to distract us.

651
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:10,720
What's going on?
Are you okay?

652
00:38:10,722 --> 00:38:13,923
Just thinking
about this headset.

653
00:38:13,925 --> 00:38:16,393
It wasn't strong enough.

654
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,331
You could've been killed
out there, man.

655
00:38:21,333 --> 00:38:23,266
No, dude, your tech worked,

656
00:38:23,268 --> 00:38:26,503
and it proved
that we don't need Wells.

657
00:38:26,505 --> 00:38:30,940
The three of us took on Grodd
and rescued Joe.

658
00:38:30,942 --> 00:38:34,678
Together, we can do anything.

659
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:38,181
Actually, it was the four of us.

660
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,034
Hey.

661
00:38:58,036 --> 00:39:00,437
Hey.

662
00:39:00,439 --> 00:39:02,272
How did you know I was here?

663
00:39:02,274 --> 00:39:06,943
This is your spot.

664
00:39:06,945 --> 00:39:09,979
Yeah.
It's a special spot.

665
00:39:09,981 --> 00:39:13,350
It's where I first met
The Flash.

666
00:39:13,352 --> 00:39:15,652
All those times,
you were standing

667
00:39:15,654 --> 00:39:20,123
right in front of me,
and I had no idea.

668
00:39:20,125 --> 00:39:22,192
I don't even know you anymore.

669
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:29,566
Iris, what you were saying to me
when I was down the sewer...

670
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:34,537
You know why I wasn't afraid?

671
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:37,807
Because you were there.

672
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:42,145
Even though I really was scared,
having you there

673
00:39:42,147 --> 00:39:45,382
is how I could stand up
to Grodd.

674
00:39:45,384 --> 00:39:48,752
Every time I falter

675
00:39:48,754 --> 00:39:51,755
or make a mistake,

676
00:39:51,757 --> 00:39:54,057
the thought of you
is what picks me up

677
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:57,260
and keeps me going.

678
00:39:57,262 --> 00:39:59,662
Look, look,
what I'm trying to say is,

679
00:39:59,664 --> 00:40:04,033
even though
you didn't know everything

680
00:40:04,035 --> 00:40:07,737
about my life this past year,
that does not mean

681
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:10,607
that you weren't a part of it.

682
00:40:10,609 --> 00:40:12,709
You were.

683
00:40:12,711 --> 00:40:15,979
Every single day.

684
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:20,683
Without you,

685
00:40:20,685 --> 00:40:24,187
there wouldn't be The Flash.

686
00:40:24,189 --> 00:40:28,691
I've thought
about what you said,

687
00:40:28,693 --> 00:40:31,294
and maybe you were right.

688
00:40:31,296 --> 00:40:34,464
I have been thinking about you,

689
00:40:34,466 --> 00:40:37,300
about us.

690
00:40:37,302 --> 00:40:40,103
But I can't do that anymore.

691
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:41,871
Eddie is the man
that I live with,

692
00:40:41,873 --> 00:40:45,141
the man that I love,
and he's still missing.

693
00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:46,476
I know.

694
00:40:46,478 --> 00:40:48,878
I'm gonna bring him back.

695
00:40:53,884 --> 00:40:56,953
And after that?

696
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:58,822
I don't know.

697
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:05,128
I don't know.

698
00:41:24,448 --> 00:41:26,082
So now what?

699
00:41:26,084 --> 00:41:29,118
Now...

700
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,587
I have the key.

701
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:35,325
The key to what?

702
00:41:57,781 --> 00:41:59,749
Time to go home.
