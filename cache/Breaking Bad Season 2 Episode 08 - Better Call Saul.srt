2
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,855
Hey.

3
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:27,145
You...

4
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,479
You selling?

5
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:32,274
I don't know
what you're talking about.

6
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:34,697
Okay. That's cool.

7
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:41,202
I'm just saying, you know,
if you were selling...

8
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:43,914
...I could maybe do with a teenth.

9
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:48,498
You're kidding, right?

10
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:51,833
Dude, I so smell bacon.

11
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,341
What? What are you talking about?

12
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:56,215
Oh, gee, I don't know.

13
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:59,267
How about over there.
That brown van.

14
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:01,640
That's yours, right?

15
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:03,763
What brown van?

16
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:06,145
Parked all inconspicuous.

17
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:08,434
It's a cop van.

18
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:11,697
Yeah, another one right over there.

19
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:15,152
"Duke City Flowers"? Come on.

20
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:17,407
Can't you at least be original?

21
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:20,027
Dude, I just wanna get high.

22
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:22,453
A flower van.

23
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,788
You know what you should do
is a garbage truck.

24
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:27,960
Seriously, and I don't mean
to disrespect...

25
00:01:28,172 --> 00:01:30,745
...but if you put cops
in the back of a garbage truck...

26
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:33,042
...there's no way
I'm seriously thinking...

27
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,546
...that there's cops
in the back of a garbage truck.

28
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:39,381
It's a freebie, yo. Just think about it.

29
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,758
Think about it, boys.

30
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:45,807
All right. I'm hitting it.

31
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:48,481
You dudes give up that easy?

32
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:50,685
I'm not a cop.

33
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:54,861
Then lift your shirt.
Show me you're not wearing a wire.

34
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,117
All right, you know what?

35
00:01:58,327 --> 00:02:01,114
Just to show you
you're being an asshole.

36
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,406
I'm blinded by white.

37
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:04,619
Douchebag.

38
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,324
Come on. I was joking. Come on.

39
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:10,913
Don't walk away angry.
Sit down. Come on.

40
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:14,424
I mean, what are you
complaining about?

41
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,876
You got abs, man. Kind of.

42
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,969
Whatever, dude.

43
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:20,889
I'm not even sure
I wanna buy anymore.

44
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,769
I think you turned me off
to the whole thing.

45
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,017
Come on. Don't be like that.

46
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:29,433
I just need you to prove it,
you know?

47
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,144
Prove you're not a cop.

48
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,064
How the hell
am I supposed to do that?

49
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:36,607
I don't know.

50
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:41,193
Hey, I got it. Go over there
and punch that dude right in the face.

51
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,155
Which dude?

52
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:44,617
- That dude?
- Yeah.

53
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,287
No way. He'd kick my ass.

54
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:49,794
True that.

55
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:54,421
- This is so hard, you know?
- Yeah.

56
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:58,761
I know.

57
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,804
It's simple.

58
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:05,469
If you ask a cop if he's a cop,
he's, like, obligated to tell you.

59
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:07,559
It's in the Constitution.

60
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,894
Constitution of America?

61
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,855
So go ahead and ask.

62
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,359
- You a cop?
- No, no. Not like that.

63
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:19,696
Ask it, like, official.

64
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,482
Are you a police officer?

65
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:26,571
No, I am not a police officer.

66
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,826
Okay, then. Hundred
and seventy-five for a teenth.

67
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:32,835
The price is the price, yo.

68
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:38,961
All right.

69
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:07,323
There you go. Enjoy.

70
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,956
Thanks, man.

71
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,043
Albuquerque Police!
You're under arrest! Get on the ground!

72
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:23,720
Get on your stomach now!
On your stomach! Get on the ground!

73
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,843
Hold it right there. Don't move.
Stay down.

74
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:53,956
I had a good job
until my boss accused me of stealing.

75
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,127
I'd better call Saul!

76
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,669
I was out partying,
minding my own business...

77
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:08,596
- You are under arrest.
- I'd better call Saul!

78
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:10,597
Hi, I'm Saul Goodman.

79
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,519
Did you know that you have rights?

80
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,185
The Constitution says you do.
And so do I.

81
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:17,356
I believe that until proven guilty...

82
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:20,734
...every man, woman,
and child in this country is innocent.

83
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:22,903
And that's why I fight for you,
Albuquerque.

84
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:24,111
Better call Saul.

85
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,400
Saul Goodman, attorney at law,
505-164-CALL.

86
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:29,619
That's 505-164-CALL.

87
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,996
I really need to get some furniture.

88
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,795
I suggest you start with a bed.

89
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:43,754
God, I wish we could smoke in here.

90
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:47,303
- Well, you can't.
- Yeah, no. I know.

91
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,507
I'm just saying.

92
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,762
Don't think I can't smell that weed.

93
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,853
You better seriously hope
that airs out.

94
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,816
My dad will keep
your security deposit.

95
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:03,312
He has a nose
like a damn bloodhound.

96
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,155
Yeah?

97
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:09,577
Has he ever caught you?

98
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:14,405
Yeah. Many times.

99
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:17,286
Well, listen.

100
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:21,330
Since I already lost my deposit
and all...

101
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,122
...maybe we should light up.

102
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:29,715
No, thanks.

103
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:30,927
You sure?

104
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:34,883
Well, is it cool if I burn one?

105
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,345
Maybe you'll change your mind.

106
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:43,651
Do what you wanna do, I guess.

107
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:51,990
Hey. What'd I say?

108
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:54,032
Nothing.

109
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:57,206
I just have to go is all.

110
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:17,682
What's this?

111
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:20,850
My 18-month chip.

112
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:24,564
I'm in recovery.

113
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:30,401
And, you know,
pot is like stepping stones.

114
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:36,950
Recovery? That's cool.

115
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,494
Right on.

116
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:40,870
I respect that.

117
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:43,921
You know,
I don't really burn much anymore.

118
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:47,048
It's just a sometime thing.

119
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:51,255
But no more, like, in the house.

120
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:58,058
So you wanna go grab some dinner?

121
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,761
I could really go for some Chinese.

122
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,440
No, I better hit it.

123
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:05,853
We...

124
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:07,772
We cool?

125
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:12,902
Your satellite is on, by the way.

126
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:18,578
That screen is badass.

127
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:34,964
I just think it's asking a lot.

128
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:37,174
He knows it.

129
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,052
He's done nothing but apologise.

130
00:08:40,646 --> 00:08:42,188
Is this gonna be
every weekend now?

131
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:45,683
No. It's just the end of the quarter.
You remember how that was.

132
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:50,479
But I am earning double time,
so there's a bright side.

133
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:53,070
So when the laziest boy
in the world wakes up...

134
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,240
...tell him he better wash
those sneakers.

135
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:56,448
And I said bye.

136
00:08:56,662 --> 00:08:58,987
And tell him
to let them air-dry this time.

137
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,958
I don't want him
banging the hell out of my dryer.

138
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:03,789
What?

139
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,627
What, you don't even get
casual Saturday?

140
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,919
I mean...

141
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:10,792
No, it's just you...

142
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,919
You look nice is all.

143
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:15,343
It's work, Walt.
And everybody is gonna be there.

144
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:17,511
- Okay.
- Okay.

145
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,180
Maybe we'll order a pizza tonight?

146
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:21,805
Okay.

147
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:23,517
- Bye.
- Bye.

148
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:38,987
Hi. You've reached Walt,
Skyler and Walter, Jr.

149
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,529
Please leave a message,
and we'll get back to you.

150
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:46,245
Skyler? Are you there?
I don't know what to do.

151
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:50,044
I... I need to talk to you. I...

152
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:53,792
Hey, Marie. It's me. What's up?

153
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:03,145
Yesterday I got home
and found him.

154
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:06,303
He didn't even tell me
he was coming.

155
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:10,231
- A man was killed?
- A Federale, right in front of him.

156
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:14,522
Three agents wounded,
one lost his leg.

157
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:18,358
It's like what you hear about
from Iraq or something.

158
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:21,364
- The IEDs.
- Oh, Jesus.

159
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,415
I had to hear about it
from Steve Gomez.

160
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:27,032
Hank talked to his ASAC
for about an hour.

161
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:30,502
Hank could win an Oscar.
He's so damn breezy with the man.

162
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:33,750
He hangs up the phone,
goes right back to bed.

163
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:39,803
And all he keeps saying is,
"I'm fine. I'm fine. Leave me alone."

164
00:11:03,956 --> 00:11:05,616
Baby, not now.

165
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:09,834
It's... It's me, Hank. Sorry.

166
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:15,631
Hey, buddy. What's...?

167
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:17,385
What's up?

168
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:21,305
I just...

169
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:23,888
Do you mind if I...?

170
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,093
No. No.

171
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:29,980
So...

172
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:34,433
How you doing?

173
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,698
Oh, you know, lousy.

174
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:39,776
Montezuma's revenge, bigtime.

175
00:11:39,992 --> 00:11:45,330
I mean, everything's going through me
like crap through a tinhorn.

176
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:47,289
Better not get too close.

177
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:50,453
Well, I'll take my chances.

178
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:02,467
I guess you heard about
what happened down in Juárez?

179
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:05,843
Terrible.

180
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:09,176
What do you expect?
Bunch of freaking animals.

181
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:11,021
It's like Apocalypse Now
down there.

182
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:15,063
It's like Colonel Kurtz
holed up in his jungle.

183
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:20,194
And my SAC in El Paso
sends me home.

184
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:24,775
Now, that's a sound leadership
decision right there, huh?

185
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:28,079
You know, you don't put
your second most senior man...

186
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,366
...on the trail
of those motherless bastards...

187
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:33,075
...you send him home. You know?

188
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:36,208
I was, you know...
"He's out getting an evidence bag...

189
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,332
...and so ends up
without a scratch on him.

190
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:42,050
So must be something wrong
with that picture, you know."

191
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:47,552
So are you home for good then?

192
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:51,053
No, no. It's...

193
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:55,139
Playing it by ear. To be determined.

194
00:12:57,694 --> 00:13:01,478
Think you might wanna talk it through
with somebody?

195
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:04,735
What, a shrink?
No, no, no. Can't go down that road.

196
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:07,656
Start going down that road,
kiss your career goodbye.

197
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:14,535
Or Marie. Or me, if you like.

198
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:24,929
You know, I don't know
how to say this. I...

199
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:29,008
You know, the things I deal with...

200
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:33,477
...you and me don't have much of a...

201
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:37,733
What you might call
"an experiential overlap."

202
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:48,400
What if I told you we do?

203
00:13:55,919 --> 00:14:00,380
I have spent my whole life scared.

204
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:05,546
Frightened of things
that could happen...

205
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:08,088
...might happen, might not happen.

206
00:14:08,307 --> 00:14:11,806
Fifty years I spent like that.

207
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:17,138
Finding myself awake
at 3 in the morning.

208
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,569
But you know what?

209
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:26,145
Ever since my diagnosis...

210
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:29,777
...I sleep just fine.

211
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,036
Okay.

212
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:43,043
And I came to realize
it's that fear that's the worst of it.

213
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:45,417
That's the real enemy.

214
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:49,764
So...

215
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:53,428
Get up.

216
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:56,183
Get out in the real world.

217
00:14:56,813 --> 00:15:01,559
And you kick that bastard
as hard as you can right in the teeth.

218
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:19,293
Do it again. Go on.

219
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:29,552
Ten thousand even, same as last time.
It's totally accurate.

220
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:32,178
You and I,
we are gonna feed this machine.

221
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:36,009
- I want it running 24 hours a day.
- Right on.

222
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,021
Not yours, I take it.

223
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:52,149
We got 10, 20, 30...

224
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:57,364
...44, five each.

225
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:02,703
Three pounds should be 48 each.

226
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:03,952
Who's short?

227
00:16:04,173 --> 00:16:06,924
All right. Don't freak, all right?
We didn't get ripped off.

228
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:09,091
But Badger hasn't kicked in
his full amount.

229
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:11,591
I know he was planning on pulling
an all-nighter...

230
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:13,513
...so he's probably still in the sack.

231
00:16:13,724 --> 00:16:17,591
Then wake him up.
He can sleep after we're paid.

232
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:20,267
Why you gotta be such a hard-on?

233
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,972
You're not his pal. You're his boss.

234
00:16:23,192 --> 00:16:25,599
This only works when
they're scared of you, remember?

235
00:16:26,737 --> 00:16:28,895
Jack-off.

236
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:34,283
It's going straight to voice-mail.

237
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:36,787
Voicemail?

238
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:41,040
Just chill, okay? Count your money.

239
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:47,543
- Combo.
- Yo, what's up?

240
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:49,964
You seen Badger?

241
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:52,885
Don't you cover for him, bitch.

242
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:55,967
I ask you a straight-up question,
I expect a straight-up answer.

243
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:13,235
Well?

244
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:19,577
They were too scared to tell me.

245
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,832
Badger got busted.

246
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:24,834
He's in jail.

247
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,616
Honey, I'm home!

248
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:07,041
Too slow! What's up?

249
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:09,045
Got more lives than a damn cat.

250
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:11,213
Now if I could only learn
to lick myself.

251
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:15,545
What's up, guys? Good to see you.
Good to see you. Good to see you.

252
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:19,546
All right. Let's all get back to work,
for chrissake, okay?

253
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:23,017
In my office, man. Let's see
what you bozos been up to lately.

254
00:18:46,502 --> 00:18:47,581
You okay?

255
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:49,289
Hanging in?

256
00:18:49,505 --> 00:18:51,212
What's it look like?

257
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:54,759
- What's this from A.P.D.?
- Been checking with them to see...

258
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:57,424
...if they come across
that famous blue meth of yours.

259
00:18:57,638 --> 00:19:00,093
Sure enough, last night.

260
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:02,715
Got themselves
an honest-to-God dealer.

261
00:19:02,935 --> 00:19:06,220
I was thinking of cruising over
and saying hello.

262
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,439
Maybe you'd like to go with me?

263
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:11,938
Yeah. Well, all right.

264
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:14,942
You told me to my face
you weren't a cop, man.

265
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,566
I feel manipulated.

266
00:19:17,783 --> 00:19:19,360
I thought we were gonna hang out.

267
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:21,070
We are hanging out, Badger.

268
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:23,612
You like Badger or Brandon?

269
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:28,917
I like people who don't, like,
abuse the Constitution.

270
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:30,290
Badger, listen.

271
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:32,249
Hey.

272
00:19:32,673 --> 00:19:34,998
I'm trying to help you here, man.

273
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:39,880
Now, if you just tell me
who your supplier is...

274
00:19:40,097 --> 00:19:43,014
...I think this can end
very well for you.

275
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:47,221
What are you doing, detective, talking
to my client without me present?

276
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:48,469
You sneaky Pete.

277
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:51,143
Which is which?

278
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:53,766
What, did the academy hire you
right out of the womb?

279
00:19:53,986 --> 00:19:55,777
You guys get younger every...

280
00:19:55,988 --> 00:19:57,648
What'd you say to baby face?

281
00:19:57,865 --> 00:19:59,275
Did you say anything stupid?

282
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:01,484
By "anything stupid,"
I mean anything at all.

283
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:04,157
Look at you.
Mouth open, vocal chords a-twitter.

284
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:06,696
We'll talk about it later.
Right now, you out.

285
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:10,165
Ten minutes ago. Go on.
There are laws, detective.

286
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:12,535
Have your kindergarten teacher
read them to you.

287
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:16,455
Go grab a juice box.
Have a nap. Go on.

288
00:20:20,012 --> 00:20:21,007
All right.

289
00:20:22,181 --> 00:20:23,924
Who do we have?

290
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:25,839
Brandon Mayhew.

291
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:29,345
Brandon Mayhew. All right.

292
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:31,936
Brandon Mayhew.

293
00:20:34,902 --> 00:20:37,772
- Here we go. Public masturbation.
- What?

294
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:40,859
I don't get it. What's the kick?
Why don't you do it at home...

295
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:44,693
...with a big flat-screen TV,
50 channels of pay-per-view?

296
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:47,403
In a Starbucks. That's nice.

297
00:20:47,623 --> 00:20:49,532
That ain't me, man. I...

298
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:54,495
I was the guy who was selling meth.
Allegedly.

299
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:57,540
Okay. All right. I got you.
Meth. Right.

300
00:20:57,758 --> 00:20:59,881
Sorry, that was a little
transpositional error.

301
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:02,715
Nothing a little Wite-Out
can't take care of.

302
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:05,847
Yeah, and felony quantity.

303
00:21:06,058 --> 00:21:08,346
- Just barely.
- Yeah, just barely.

304
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,597
The cops are like butchers.
Always got their thumbs on the scales.

305
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:13,687
But good luck arguing that in court.

306
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,609
Let me get down to brass tacks.

307
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:18,526
I'm gonna get you
a second phone call.

308
00:21:18,737 --> 00:21:20,730
You're gonna call
your mommy or your daddy...

309
00:21:20,948 --> 00:21:23,320
...or your parish priest
or your Boy Scout leader...

310
00:21:23,534 --> 00:21:26,653
...and they're gonna
deliver me a check for $4650.

311
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,492
I'm gonna write that down
on the back of my business card.

312
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:32,244
Four-six-five-zero. Okay?

313
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:36,587
And I need that in a cashier's check
or a money order, doesn't matter.

314
00:21:36,797 --> 00:21:39,252
Actually, I want it in a money order.

315
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:42,218
And make it out to
"Ice Station Zebra Associates."

316
00:21:42,427 --> 00:21:44,883
That's my loan-out. It's totally legit.

317
00:21:45,097 --> 00:21:47,136
It's done just for tax purposes.

318
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:49,887
And after that,
we can discuss Visa or MasterCard...

319
00:21:50,102 --> 00:21:53,969
...but definitely not American Express,
so don't even ask. All right?

320
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:55,220
Any questions?

321
00:21:58,277 --> 00:22:00,150
You're gonna get me off, right?

322
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:05,022
What do I look like, your high-school
girlfriend? Five fingers, no waiting?

323
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:08,909
That's a joke, Brandon. Lighten up.

324
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:12,906
Son, I promise you this.

325
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:16,245
I will give you
the best criminal defense...

326
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:17,837
...that money can buy.

327
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:21,921
Yeah, but, Francesca,
I took these already.

328
00:22:22,134 --> 00:22:23,842
Didn't I take these already?

329
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:27,006
It's on your head. You're not
supposed to double up on vitamin A.

330
00:22:27,222 --> 00:22:29,096
It's bad for the liver.

331
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:32,807
Okay, who's next?

332
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,262
Did him. I did him.

333
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,722
That one went public defender.
Thanks for nothing.

334
00:22:37,941 --> 00:22:41,026
What happened to my masturbator?
You got me all turned around.

335
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:43,112
Hang on. I'll get back to you.

336
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:48,071
I sense you're discussing my client.
Anything you care to share with me?

337
00:22:48,285 --> 00:22:50,906
Sure. Your commercials?
They suck ass.

338
00:22:51,622 --> 00:22:54,243
I've seen better acting
in an epileptic whorehouse.

339
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:56,201
Is that like the one
your mom works at?

340
00:22:56,418 --> 00:22:59,205
Is she still offering
the two-for-one discount?

341
00:22:59,421 --> 00:23:02,292
DEA, huh? For a street bust.

342
00:23:02,508 --> 00:23:05,627
Now, what would two feds
want with that little twerp?

343
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:21,690
Sooner or later,
this was gonna happen.

344
00:23:21,902 --> 00:23:24,227
You want your exponential growth...

345
00:23:24,446 --> 00:23:26,486
...guys are gonna get busted.
Simple as that.

346
00:23:26,698 --> 00:23:29,616
How about we get him a real attorney?
What the hell is this?

347
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:31,486
This is who he hires?

348
00:23:31,703 --> 00:23:34,704
What? Are you kidding me?
This is the guy you want.

349
00:23:36,124 --> 00:23:37,749
This is the guy I'd hire.

350
00:23:38,544 --> 00:23:39,919
It's the guy you'd hire.

351
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:41,457
Look, you remember Emilio?

352
00:23:41,922 --> 00:23:44,793
Okay, this dude got Emilio off,
like, twice. Okay?

353
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:49,551
Both times, they had him
dead to rights, yo. And then, poof.

354
00:23:49,763 --> 00:23:50,926
Dude is like Houdini.

355
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:52,931
Seriously,
when the going gets tough...

356
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:54,968
...you don't want a criminal lawyer.

357
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:58,519
You want a "criminal" lawyer.

358
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,522
Know what I'm saying?

359
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:04,232
Look, we're in good shape,
Mr. White.

360
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:06,686
Badger is way too loyal to roll.

361
00:24:06,905 --> 00:24:08,862
Plus, he's scared shitless of me,
all right.

362
00:24:09,074 --> 00:24:13,368
We pay four large. Cost of business.
Take it out of his payroll.

363
00:24:13,579 --> 00:24:15,322
And it's only his first dealing rap...

364
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:18,112
...so, worst-case scenario,
you know, they plead him out.

365
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:21,868
He does five months picking up litter
in an orange jump suit.

366
00:24:23,088 --> 00:24:27,038
So who goes inside?
I don't need them seeing my face.

367
00:24:27,259 --> 00:24:29,797
Well, I don't need them
seeing my face.

368
00:24:30,012 --> 00:24:33,096
Why not?
You look like his typical clientele.

369
00:24:33,307 --> 00:24:34,765
Dick.

370
00:24:34,975 --> 00:24:36,469
Fine.

371
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,682
We'll flip for it, all right? Call it.

372
00:24:41,273 --> 00:24:42,897
Heads.

373
00:24:55,746 --> 00:24:59,079
Mayhew? Mr. Mayhew?

374
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:14,926
Mr. Mayhew.

375
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:18,094
Nice of you to come down. Please.

376
00:25:18,435 --> 00:25:19,550
Look at you.

377
00:25:19,978 --> 00:25:23,762
Should I call the FBI
and tell them I found D.B. Cooper?

378
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:25,145
Joking.

379
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:27,435
I... Please, come on.

380
00:25:27,653 --> 00:25:29,444
Come on. Please.

381
00:25:29,655 --> 00:25:31,446
Hello.

382
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:34,819
Saul Goodman. Please sit.

383
00:25:37,454 --> 00:25:42,282
So it's a shame that we have to meet
under these circumstances.

384
00:25:46,672 --> 00:25:49,626
I believe you have
something for me?

385
00:25:49,967 --> 00:25:51,959
Oh, yes.

386
00:25:54,596 --> 00:25:58,926
- Mayhew. Is that Irish or English?
- Irish.

387
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:01,978
Faith and begorra.
A fellow potato-eater.

388
00:26:03,188 --> 00:26:04,564
My real name is McGill.

389
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,982
The Jew thing
I just do for the homeboys.

390
00:26:07,192 --> 00:26:11,237
They all want a pipe-hitting member
of the tribe, so to speak.

391
00:26:11,822 --> 00:26:14,692
I digress.
Good things are happening.

392
00:26:14,908 --> 00:26:18,740
Fact is, your nephew is gonna
get out in no time.

393
00:26:18,954 --> 00:26:20,578
That's wonderful, yeah.

394
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:23,161
There's still a few details
to be ironed out...

395
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:25,332
...but now that the DEA
is involved...

396
00:26:25,794 --> 00:26:29,245
...I think he's looking
at time served, then probation.

397
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:32,833
So leave your number with Francesca,
and we'll be in touch.

398
00:26:33,051 --> 00:26:34,676
- Excuse me, the DEA?
- Yeah.

399
00:26:34,887 --> 00:26:38,469
That's the Drug Enforcement
Administration. The feds.

400
00:26:41,226 --> 00:26:43,682
I hope that I'm not
the breaker of bad news...

401
00:26:43,896 --> 00:26:47,430
...but your nephew got mixed up
with some pretty nasty customers.

402
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:48,645
I understand that.

403
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:50,567
What does that have
to do with the DEA?

404
00:26:50,777 --> 00:26:52,272
They're after some mystery man...

405
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:54,943
...some heavy-hitter
that goes by the name Heisenberg.

406
00:26:55,157 --> 00:26:57,564
They want this guy
like the axe wants the turkey.

407
00:26:57,784 --> 00:26:59,694
Seems young Brandon
may have information...

408
00:26:59,912 --> 00:27:01,738
...that could lead to his arrest.

409
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:04,282
Jesus, cheer up.
This is good news.

410
00:27:04,499 --> 00:27:07,037
I mean, Brandon fell head-first
into the doo-doo pile...

411
00:27:07,252 --> 00:27:09,209
...and came up
smelling like Paco Rabanne.

412
00:27:10,339 --> 00:27:13,542
Wait, wait. Look, I just... I think...

413
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:18,884
I just think that we should
review our options.

414
00:27:19,097 --> 00:27:20,508
Options?

415
00:27:20,724 --> 00:27:22,717
I'm gonna tell you
what your options are.

416
00:27:22,935 --> 00:27:26,517
You got a grand total of two.
Option A: Brandon takes the deal.

417
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,888
Option B:
Brandon goes up to the penitentiary...

418
00:27:29,107 --> 00:27:31,729
...and gets his rectum
resized about yay big.

419
00:27:31,944 --> 00:27:35,562
Look, look. What about reprisals?

420
00:27:35,781 --> 00:27:37,572
I mean, if Badger...

421
00:27:37,783 --> 00:27:43,239
If Brandon informs
on this Heisenberg...

422
00:27:43,747 --> 00:27:45,407
I mean, what if, God forbid...

423
00:27:45,624 --> 00:27:50,416
...that they decide to take revenge?

424
00:27:50,629 --> 00:27:52,420
What have you been telling him?

425
00:27:52,631 --> 00:27:56,047
The kid keeps spouting off about,
"if I talk, they'll kill me."

426
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:59,177
Right now, he's the only thing
holding up this deal.

427
00:28:00,138 --> 00:28:03,056
- Good.
- No, that's not good. That's terrible.

428
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:06,351
Trust me, sir, your nephew
won't last in prison two weeks.

429
00:28:06,562 --> 00:28:09,231
You let him take his chances
on the outside.

430
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:11,397
Maybe I can work
in some witness protection.

431
00:28:11,608 --> 00:28:15,273
No, look, look.
These are vicious, desperate people.

432
00:28:15,487 --> 00:28:20,445
I've been told that
one of them killed another man...

433
00:28:20,659 --> 00:28:24,110
...by crushing his head
with an ATM machine.

434
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:27,786
People love to take credit
for the fun ones.

435
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,451
The guy who got his head smooshed
used to be a client of mine.

436
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:34,243
His wife killed him, all right?
It was open and shut.

437
00:28:34,464 --> 00:28:36,955
Trust me, you folks have
nothing to worry about, okay?

438
00:28:37,176 --> 00:28:40,509
I'm gonna set your nephew straight,
get him singing like a canary...

439
00:28:40,721 --> 00:28:43,128
...all's right with the world.

440
00:28:45,225 --> 00:28:47,348
Ten thousand dollars.

441
00:29:01,033 --> 00:29:03,820
Ten thousand, cash to you.

442
00:29:05,037 --> 00:29:08,702
I'm not saying to throw the case.

443
00:29:08,916 --> 00:29:13,993
Just no talking to the DEA.

444
00:29:15,047 --> 00:29:17,335
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

445
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:19,508
Yes.

446
00:29:20,385 --> 00:29:22,177
What's it going to be?

447
00:29:24,681 --> 00:29:27,007
What, dude wouldn't take a bribe?

448
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:30,186
That dude in there?
Saul Goodman we're talking about?

449
00:29:30,395 --> 00:29:32,055
Yeah. "Morally outraged," he said.

450
00:29:32,272 --> 00:29:33,683
Threatened to call the police.

451
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:38,857
- Wait, and Badger is gonna spill?
- Like the Exxon Valdez.

452
00:29:39,905 --> 00:29:41,981
So, what do we do about it?

453
00:29:52,668 --> 00:29:54,707
Hey, Francesca,
how about I follow you home?

454
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,951
No.

455
00:29:56,171 --> 00:29:57,831
For safety.

456
00:29:58,048 --> 00:29:59,590
What?

457
00:30:01,385 --> 00:30:04,339
God, you are killing me
with that booty.

458
00:30:17,025 --> 00:30:19,563
Talk to me.
Come on, talk to me, guys, huh?

459
00:30:19,778 --> 00:30:23,396
Come on, just tell me what you want.
Jesus!

460
00:30:24,658 --> 00:30:26,734
Oh, no, no, no!

461
00:30:26,952 --> 00:30:29,869
No, it wasn't me.
It was Ignacio. He's the one.

462
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,832
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no.

463
00:30:35,711 --> 00:30:37,584
Shut up, dude.

464
00:30:38,046 --> 00:30:41,166
Shut up, all right?
Just speak English.

465
00:30:41,383 --> 00:30:44,254
Lalo didn't send you? No Lalo?

466
00:30:44,803 --> 00:30:48,006
- Who?
- Oh, thank God! Oh, Christ!

467
00:30:48,223 --> 00:30:50,761
Oh, I thought...

468
00:30:51,768 --> 00:30:53,927
What can I do for you gentlemen?

469
00:30:54,146 --> 00:30:56,553
Anything.
Just tell me what you need.

470
00:30:56,773 --> 00:31:00,854
This afternoon, an associate of ours
offered you $10,000.

471
00:31:01,069 --> 00:31:02,612
You should have taken it.

472
00:31:02,821 --> 00:31:05,905
Wait a minute.
This is in regards to what's-his-name?

473
00:31:06,116 --> 00:31:08,524
Badger! Brandon Mayhew.

474
00:31:08,911 --> 00:31:11,236
The uncle. That was your guy?

475
00:31:12,456 --> 00:31:15,207
No of fence, but I don't take bribes
from strangers, you know?

476
00:31:15,417 --> 00:31:17,742
Better safe than sorry.
That's my motto.

477
00:31:17,961 --> 00:31:22,374
- But I'll take your money! Sure!
- No, that offer has expired, yo.

478
00:31:22,591 --> 00:31:26,505
It was kind of low anyways.
But okay, okay, I'll take it.

479
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,428
Just tell me what you need,
all right?

480
00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:30,715
I'm easy. I'm gonna keep
a happy thought...

481
00:31:30,933 --> 00:31:33,221
...and assume
this is just a negotiating tactic.

482
00:31:33,435 --> 00:31:36,471
All right, listen to me very carefully.

483
00:31:36,688 --> 00:31:38,562
You are going to give
Badger Mayhew...

484
00:31:38,774 --> 00:31:41,894
...the best legal representation ever.

485
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:44,352
But no deals with the DEA.

486
00:31:44,571 --> 00:31:48,236
All right? Badger will not identify
anyone to anybody.

487
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:50,988
If he does, you're dead.

488
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:55,410
Why don't you just kill Badger?

489
00:31:58,418 --> 00:32:01,206
I mean, follow me, but if a mosquito
is buzzing around you...

490
00:32:01,421 --> 00:32:04,625
...and it bites you on the ass,
you don't go gunning for the attorney.

491
00:32:04,842 --> 00:32:08,257
You go grab a fly swatter.
I mean, so to speak.

492
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:11,845
I mean, all due respect,
but do I have to spell this out for you?

493
00:32:12,432 --> 00:32:15,469
- We're not killing Badger, yo!
- Then you got real problems, okay.

494
00:32:15,686 --> 00:32:17,678
Because the DEA
will come down on your boy...

495
00:32:17,896 --> 00:32:19,805
...like a proverbial ton of bricks.

496
00:32:20,023 --> 00:32:22,099
I don't think
I'm going out on a limb here...

497
00:32:22,317 --> 00:32:24,109
...but, hey,
he's not gonna like prison.

498
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:28,815
He's gonna sing like Celine Dion
regardless of what you do to me.

499
00:32:34,413 --> 00:32:35,693
Mr. Mayhew?

500
00:32:38,417 --> 00:32:42,035
I recognise your cough. Take that
mask off, you know. Get some air.

501
00:32:42,421 --> 00:32:43,915
Go on.

502
00:32:51,096 --> 00:32:52,721
- God.
- Take it easy.

503
00:32:52,931 --> 00:32:55,553
Breathe in, breathe out.

504
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:59,635
All right. I'm gonna stand up, all right?
Because I got bad knees.

505
00:33:00,397 --> 00:33:02,224
That's better.

506
00:33:02,983 --> 00:33:06,566
Okay, now listen. The three of us
are gonna work this out.

507
00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:08,273
Yeah? How?

508
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:11,235
First thing, you'll put a dollar
in my pocket, both of you.

509
00:33:14,077 --> 00:33:16,236
You want attorney-client privilege,
don't you?

510
00:33:16,455 --> 00:33:19,491
So that everything you say
is strictly between us.

511
00:33:20,751 --> 00:33:22,578
I mean it. Put a dollar in my pocket.

512
00:33:22,794 --> 00:33:24,419
Come on, make it official.

513
00:33:25,422 --> 00:33:27,165
Come on, do it.

514
00:33:28,425 --> 00:33:31,212
That's it, come on. Just a dollar.

515
00:33:35,432 --> 00:33:39,097
All right, now you, ski bum.
Come on. Give with the dollar.

516
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:40,801
- Go on.
- Be smart.

517
00:33:41,021 --> 00:33:42,480
What?

518
00:33:46,151 --> 00:33:47,943
- All I got is a five.
- I'll take a five.

519
00:33:48,153 --> 00:33:51,736
Come on, already.
Come on. Be cool.

520
00:33:54,076 --> 00:33:56,152
Okay, you're now both
officially represented...

521
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:57,947
...by Saul Goodman and Associates.

522
00:33:58,163 --> 00:34:02,540
Your secrets are safe with me
under threat of disbarment. All right?

523
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,245
Take the ski mask off. I feel like I'm
talking to the Weather Underground.

524
00:34:08,173 --> 00:34:10,130
Just do it.

525
00:34:14,763 --> 00:34:18,132
Okay, so if a prison shanking
is completely off the table...

526
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:19,595
And we're sure of that?

527
00:34:22,229 --> 00:34:23,723
No shanking!

528
00:34:25,732 --> 00:34:27,227
All right, all right.

529
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:32,272
The way I see it is
somebody is going to prison.

530
00:34:36,201 --> 00:34:38,075
It's just a matter of who.

531
00:34:39,538 --> 00:34:42,788
All right. Lame-ass TV ads aside...

532
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,499
...your lawyer here,
he cooked you up a pretty killer deal.

533
00:34:46,712 --> 00:34:47,957
Time served, no probation.

534
00:34:48,172 --> 00:34:51,505
It's pretty slick.
Couldn't believe the judge went for it.

535
00:34:52,426 --> 00:34:54,798
Don't get cocky.
You ain't home free yet.

536
00:34:55,012 --> 00:34:57,051
You don't give us
the name of your supplier...

537
00:34:57,264 --> 00:35:00,467
- ...you're going nowhere.
- The tough guy act is unnecessary.

538
00:35:00,684 --> 00:35:02,973
This young man
is cooperating fully.

539
00:35:03,187 --> 00:35:06,104
Is that right?
Yeah, you cooperating?

540
00:35:10,068 --> 00:35:12,939
Okay, let's start with a name.

541
00:35:15,407 --> 00:35:17,483
He just goes by Heisenberg.

542
00:35:18,035 --> 00:35:19,030
Heisenberg, huh?

543
00:35:20,412 --> 00:35:21,871
How old is this Heisenberg?

544
00:35:22,581 --> 00:35:26,365
Old. Like 50 or 70 or something.

545
00:35:26,585 --> 00:35:28,708
- Height?
- Average, I guess.

546
00:35:28,921 --> 00:35:30,794
Medium height, medium weight.

547
00:35:31,006 --> 00:35:34,007
- What color hair?
- No hair.

548
00:35:34,218 --> 00:35:35,842
Dude is balder than you.

549
00:35:38,055 --> 00:35:40,510
1963, James Edward Kilkelly...

550
00:35:40,724 --> 00:35:43,215
...is convicted of stealing
a vending machine.

551
00:35:43,435 --> 00:35:46,222
1975, breaking and entering.

552
00:35:46,438 --> 00:35:49,059
1982, grand theft auto.

553
00:35:49,274 --> 00:35:51,600
1984, armed robbery.

554
00:35:51,818 --> 00:35:56,148
1987, 1992. You get the idea.
And here he is today.

555
00:35:56,365 --> 00:35:58,238
Better known as Jimmy In-'N-Out.

556
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:03,955
City, state and federal, he's spent
44 of the last 58 years inside.

557
00:36:04,957 --> 00:36:07,412
Entire life behind bars.

558
00:36:07,918 --> 00:36:10,160
Jimmy provides
a very special service.

559
00:36:10,379 --> 00:36:13,214
For a price,
Jimmy will go to prison for you.

560
00:36:14,216 --> 00:36:17,916
On purpose?
The guy goes to prison on purpose?

561
00:36:18,846 --> 00:36:20,755
He's actually
more comfortable inside.

562
00:36:20,973 --> 00:36:23,380
The outside world
hasn't been too kind to him.

563
00:36:25,435 --> 00:36:27,428
Sometime during
the Clinton administration...

564
00:36:27,646 --> 00:36:31,774
...Jimmy figured out how he could
use his talents to turn a profit.

565
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:41,072
- So when does all this happen?
- It's already happening.

566
00:36:41,285 --> 00:36:42,565
The buy is set for tomorrow.

567
00:36:42,786 --> 00:36:45,455
Cops bust Jimmy, Badger gets out,
everybody's happy...

568
00:36:45,664 --> 00:36:48,665
...and all it's gonna cost you
is 80 thousand and one pound...

569
00:36:48,876 --> 00:36:50,370
...of your finest meth.

570
00:36:55,007 --> 00:36:58,839
Eighty thousand dollars
for eight years of his life, huh?

571
00:36:59,052 --> 00:37:01,259
First of all,
he's not gonna do eight years.

572
00:37:01,471 --> 00:37:03,263
I'll represent him, and I guarantee...

573
00:37:03,473 --> 00:37:06,973
...there's gonna be some unexpected
problems with the prosecution's case.

574
00:37:07,186 --> 00:37:09,807
Secondly, he gets 30.
Fifty goes to me.

575
00:37:10,022 --> 00:37:13,058
- You get 50? For what?
- For facilitating.

576
00:37:13,275 --> 00:37:15,944
Who's taking a bigger risk here?
He likes prison.

577
00:37:16,153 --> 00:37:18,145
You did bring the cash, didn't you?

578
00:37:18,363 --> 00:37:21,448
Look, if this option
is too expensive...

579
00:37:21,658 --> 00:37:25,074
...you can still always... Badger
in the chow line.

580
00:37:43,388 --> 00:37:45,464
Conscience gets expensive,
doesn't it?

581
00:38:02,908 --> 00:38:05,399
All right. There's our boy.

582
00:38:06,578 --> 00:38:08,867
Right on time.

583
00:38:25,556 --> 00:38:28,556
- Go back.
- What? All right, all right, all right.

584
00:38:41,446 --> 00:38:45,065
So, what do you think?
They see us?

585
00:38:45,492 --> 00:38:47,366
No, man, I think we're good.

586
00:38:52,791 --> 00:38:54,867
Badger looks like
he's gonna throw up.

587
00:38:55,294 --> 00:38:56,752
Give me those back.

588
00:38:56,962 --> 00:38:58,919
Just give them to me.

589
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:01,381
Oh, no.

590
00:39:01,967 --> 00:39:03,165
Where the hell is Jimmy?

591
00:39:03,385 --> 00:39:05,378
Should've been here
10 minutes ago.

592
00:39:05,596 --> 00:39:10,304
You think Jimmy is actually for real?
A guy who wants to be in prison?

593
00:39:10,893 --> 00:39:12,885
There's more
than one kind of prison.

594
00:39:13,103 --> 00:39:14,930
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

595
00:39:15,147 --> 00:39:17,602
There he is... Wait a minute.

596
00:39:17,816 --> 00:39:21,351
- Oh, no, no, no.
- What? What? Let me see.

597
00:39:22,905 --> 00:39:25,111
- Who the hell is that?
- I don't know.

598
00:39:28,827 --> 00:39:31,781
Mr. Heisenberg, I presume.

599
00:39:32,831 --> 00:39:34,491
Time to move?

600
00:39:34,791 --> 00:39:36,831
Not till we see the exchange.

601
00:39:39,671 --> 00:39:42,672
No, no. Oh, shit!

602
00:39:42,883 --> 00:39:45,967
- What?
- Now he shows.

603
00:39:49,473 --> 00:39:51,382
Okay, let's do this.

604
00:39:55,562 --> 00:39:56,891
No, no.

605
00:39:57,105 --> 00:39:59,643
Oh, my God.
Jimmy is on the wrong bench. Crap!

606
00:39:59,858 --> 00:40:01,934
We're screwed!

607
00:40:02,152 --> 00:40:03,527
What are you doing?

608
00:40:03,737 --> 00:40:05,860
Hey, what are you doing?

609
00:40:09,952 --> 00:40:11,825
I don't get it. What's the holdup?

610
00:40:22,548 --> 00:40:23,828
Where's the stuff, man?

611
00:40:24,049 --> 00:40:26,172
- Where are we going?
- Just shut up.

612
00:40:32,057 --> 00:40:33,255
Get out. Go stop him.

613
00:40:33,475 --> 00:40:35,883
The DEA is right there.
If they see me, we're screwed.

614
00:40:36,103 --> 00:40:37,597
Get out. I'll do something.

615
00:40:37,813 --> 00:40:39,805
- What?
- Just go!

616
00:40:52,744 --> 00:40:54,867
Hank, I thought that was you.

617
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,658
Schrader, I'm blocked.

618
00:40:56,874 --> 00:40:59,625
- Walt, not a good time.
- How you doing? You feeling okay?

619
00:40:59,835 --> 00:41:00,831
Schrader, I'm blocked.

620
00:41:01,545 --> 00:41:03,537
We're working.
You gotta get out of here.

621
00:41:03,755 --> 00:41:07,089
- Working? Oh, like DEA working?
- Schrader, we're missing it. Schrader.

622
00:41:07,301 --> 00:41:09,340
Is something going down?

623
00:41:11,597 --> 00:41:14,135
Wrong guy, wrong guy.
Other bench.

624
00:41:20,939 --> 00:41:22,054
Walt, Walt.

625
00:41:22,274 --> 00:41:24,397
- Walter, move your ass now.
- Okay.

626
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:26,401
Listen, I'll just go, leave you alone.

627
00:41:26,612 --> 00:41:29,399
- We'll talk about it later. Just floor it.
- Should I back up?

628
00:41:29,615 --> 00:41:31,025
- Go that way.
- Forward is better?

629
00:41:31,241 --> 00:41:33,068
I'll be out of the way there.
Okay, okay.

630
00:41:33,285 --> 00:41:35,741
I'm sorry, all right? I'm sorry.

631
00:41:35,954 --> 00:41:38,528
- I'll leave you alone.
- We'll talk later. Just go.

632
00:41:39,291 --> 00:41:42,162
Where'd he go?
Where the hell did he go?

633
00:41:44,129 --> 00:41:47,379
Oh, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Got him.

634
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,012
- Looks like it's going down.
- Take him.

635
00:42:05,025 --> 00:42:08,026
Freeze! Hey, right there.
Don't move.

636
00:42:10,447 --> 00:42:11,858
Come on, let's get him up.

637
00:42:21,667 --> 00:42:23,327
Jesus!

638
00:42:24,336 --> 00:42:26,163
I think they bought it.

639
00:42:29,925 --> 00:42:30,956
Absolutely.

640
00:42:31,176 --> 00:42:34,545
Textbook bust, sir. Yes, sir.

641
00:42:34,763 --> 00:42:37,301
Looks like we got a full pound
of the blue stuff.

642
00:42:37,516 --> 00:42:42,261
Oh, and Heisenberg's real name?
James Kilkelly.

643
00:42:43,564 --> 00:42:47,644
Thank you. Thank you very much.
It was my pleasure.

644
00:43:14,386 --> 00:43:15,714
Hey.

645
00:43:16,722 --> 00:43:19,213
You weren't home,
so I let the delivery guys in.

646
00:43:19,433 --> 00:43:22,849
- I hope that's okay.
- Absolutely.

647
00:43:32,237 --> 00:43:34,396
So you bought a bed.

648
00:43:35,866 --> 00:43:36,981
Yeah.

649
00:43:37,576 --> 00:43:39,284
What is that, a king?

650
00:43:41,788 --> 00:43:43,366
Pillow top?

651
00:44:19,576 --> 00:44:23,491
Oh, my God.
You really are a chemistry teacher.

652
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:29,954
You mind?

653
00:44:34,049 --> 00:44:36,255
I was terrible at chemistry.

654
00:44:36,468 --> 00:44:39,090
I'm more of a humanities guy.

655
00:44:39,304 --> 00:44:41,878
- How did you find me?
- We should talk about that.

656
00:44:42,099 --> 00:44:46,428
It should be much, much harder
for people to track you down.

657
00:44:46,645 --> 00:44:48,270
My Pl charged me for three hours...

658
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,434
...so I seriously doubt
it took him more than one.

659
00:44:54,361 --> 00:44:57,481
So this is, what, blackmail?

660
00:44:57,698 --> 00:44:59,406
Walter, I'm your lawyer.

661
00:44:59,616 --> 00:45:04,029
Anything you say to me
is totally privileged.

662
00:45:04,246 --> 00:45:06,784
I'm not in the shakedown racket.

663
00:45:06,999 --> 00:45:09,406
I'm a lawyer. Even drug dealers
need lawyers, right?

664
00:45:09,626 --> 00:45:12,746
Especially drug dealers.

665
00:45:13,172 --> 00:45:17,216
So, what, you're just doing this
out of the kindness of your heart?

666
00:45:17,759 --> 00:45:21,045
Come on.
Have you seen my hourly rate?

667
00:45:22,347 --> 00:45:24,305
By the way,
where do you keep the money?

668
00:45:24,516 --> 00:45:28,810
Is it in your mattress? Is it in a jelly jar
buried in the side yard?

669
00:45:29,021 --> 00:45:31,975
This kid Mayhew may be the first
of your guys to get picked up...

670
00:45:32,191 --> 00:45:33,471
...but he won't be the last.

671
00:45:33,692 --> 00:45:37,227
And if I can find you,
how far behind can the cops be?

672
00:45:37,446 --> 00:45:38,857
I don't understand.

673
00:45:39,072 --> 00:45:41,943
What exactly are you
offering to do for me?

674
00:45:43,452 --> 00:45:46,488
What did Tom Hagen
do for Vito Corleone?

675
00:45:46,914 --> 00:45:49,998
I'm no Vito Corleone.

676
00:45:50,209 --> 00:45:52,960
No shit. Right now, you're Fredo.

677
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:54,664
But with some sound advice...

678
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,252
...and the proper introductions,
who knows?

679
00:45:57,466 --> 00:45:59,423
I'll tell you,
you've got the right product.

680
00:45:59,635 --> 00:46:02,386
Anything that gets the DEA's panties
in this big a bunch...

681
00:46:02,596 --> 00:46:04,256
...you're on to something special.

682
00:46:04,473 --> 00:46:08,850
And I would like to be
a small and silent part of it.

683
00:46:11,438 --> 00:46:12,469
Food for thought, yeah?

684
00:46:17,694 --> 00:46:22,356
So if you wanna make more money
and keep the money that you make...

685
00:46:23,659 --> 00:46:25,698
...better call Saul!

686
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:34,241
