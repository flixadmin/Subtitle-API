1
00:00:01,012 --> 00:00:02,482
Previously on Gotham...

2
00:00:03,209 --> 00:00:06,102
Where is Xander Wilde?

3
00:00:07,706 --> 00:00:09,339
My God,

4
00:00:09,341 --> 00:00:10,640
there's two of 'em.

5
00:00:10,642 --> 00:00:12,676
I'm gonna drive you mad...

6
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:13,534
brother.

7
00:00:13,537 --> 00:00:15,878
All of Gotham will be joining you, too.

8
00:00:15,881 --> 00:00:18,742
You shall become the Demon's Head.

9
00:00:20,112 --> 00:00:22,819
She's got the mark of the Demon's Head.

10
00:00:22,821 --> 00:00:24,154
No woman has ever been allowed

11
00:00:24,156 --> 00:00:26,367
to lead the League of Shadows.

12
00:00:27,826 --> 00:00:30,786
But the sisters of the
League are yours to command.

13
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:33,563
Tell me what I need to know.

14
00:00:35,167 --> 00:00:38,130
I could have killed
Jerome, but I didn't.

15
00:00:38,133 --> 00:00:40,435
Don't take so much responsibility that

16
00:00:40,438 --> 00:00:42,739
you get yourself killed.

17
00:00:42,741 --> 00:00:44,685
I came up with a plan

18
00:00:44,688 --> 00:00:47,974
to turn this city into a madhouse.

19
00:00:50,515 --> 00:00:53,458
Oh, we're gonna need a lot more of this.

20
00:00:57,155 --> 00:00:59,078
Thank you all for coming this evening.

21
00:00:59,081 --> 00:01:02,726
As your interim mayor, I
know my recent appointment

22
00:01:02,728 --> 00:01:04,160
was sudden.

23
00:01:04,162 --> 00:01:07,397
And, perhaps, a bit of a shock to some.

24
00:01:07,399 --> 00:01:09,227
Quite frankly, I was shocked.

25
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,402
What is important now is the
future of this great city.

26
00:01:12,404 --> 00:01:14,552
And that is why I am
meeting with all of you.

27
00:01:14,555 --> 00:01:15,739
Well, Mayor,

28
00:01:15,741 --> 00:01:20,043
as chairperson of
Gotham's Moral Authority

29
00:01:20,045 --> 00:01:21,989
Society, our members

30
00:01:21,992 --> 00:01:24,214
have been, quite frankly,

31
00:01:24,216 --> 00:01:27,751
unnerved by the recent going-ons

32
00:01:27,753 --> 00:01:29,255
in our great city.

33
00:01:29,258 --> 00:01:30,476
We have seen

34
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,179
criminals take office, gun fights

35
00:01:33,182 --> 00:01:34,872
in our streets, corruption...

36
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:38,395
Mrs. Haverstock, the
commissioner and I have worked

37
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:40,630
tirelessly these past few weeks

38
00:01:40,632 --> 00:01:41,883
to improve the way

39
00:01:41,886 --> 00:01:43,732
this city conducts itself.

40
00:01:46,638 --> 00:01:48,406
Wyatt? Everything all right?

41
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:49,708
We're looking into it now, sir.

42
00:01:49,711 --> 00:01:52,442
Did a window blow open?

43
00:01:52,444 --> 00:01:55,077
It's gotten so cold.

44
00:01:59,339 --> 00:02:01,599
- What's happened?
- Don't come any closer!

45
00:02:19,104 --> 00:02:20,603
Good evening, everyone.

46
00:02:24,258 --> 00:02:26,383
- What do you want with us?
- Sorry,

47
00:02:26,386 --> 00:02:28,344
no time for questions, Mr. Mayor.

48
00:02:28,346 --> 00:02:32,449
You see, your presence is
urgently needed elsewhere.

49
00:02:32,451 --> 00:02:34,918
Whatever you expect as ransom,

50
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,087
I-I will double it.

51
00:02:40,425 --> 00:02:43,927
I have access to the
police pension fund.

52
00:02:43,929 --> 00:02:46,614
Wow, that could be a lot of money.

53
00:02:46,617 --> 00:02:50,033
Tempting, but, uh...

54
00:02:50,035 --> 00:02:51,701
no, thanks.

55
00:02:51,703 --> 00:02:52,883
Bridgit, isn't it?

56
00:02:52,886 --> 00:02:54,731
I can get you safe passage

57
00:02:54,734 --> 00:02:57,474
from the city, money, a new home...

58
00:02:57,476 --> 00:02:59,876
It was people like you that locked me up

59
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:02,112
in Strange's lab, and thanks to that,

60
00:03:02,114 --> 00:03:04,314
there is no Bridgit anymore.

61
00:03:04,316 --> 00:03:06,316
I can get you a pardon, son.

62
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:09,161
All will be forgiven,
just stop this lunatic.

63
00:03:09,164 --> 00:03:11,688
"Lunatic" is a little harsh.

64
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:14,157
I prefer "visionary."

65
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,993
Oswald, can't you do something?

66
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,263
Afraid not.

67
00:03:21,266 --> 00:03:25,001
I am with Mr. Valeska 100%.

68
00:03:25,003 --> 00:03:27,958
Every cop in this city
will be looking for us,

69
00:03:27,961 --> 00:03:30,901
and when they find you, expect no mercy,

70
00:03:30,904 --> 00:03:32,403
just a hail of bullets.

71
00:03:32,406 --> 00:03:33,976
So serious.

72
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:37,280
That's why your approval
ratings are so low.

73
00:03:37,282 --> 00:03:38,915
Hey, tell you what.

74
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:41,234
Try threatening me again, but this time,

75
00:03:41,237 --> 00:03:42,804
try it with a smile.

76
00:03:44,087 --> 00:03:46,087
Aw, see, this is what's wrong.

77
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:49,258
Nobody knows how to
have fun anymore, right?

78
00:03:49,261 --> 00:03:51,427
But see our friend down there?

79
00:03:51,429 --> 00:03:53,096
Bag head?

80
00:03:53,098 --> 00:03:54,898
He's figured out a way to solve that.

81
00:04:09,347 --> 00:04:10,930
It's time to give this city

82
00:04:10,933 --> 00:04:12,347
the boost it needs.

83
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,850
Time to stop taking ourselves

84
00:04:13,852 --> 00:04:15,411
so seriously

85
00:04:15,414 --> 00:04:17,813
I mean, come on, Gotham.

86
00:04:17,816 --> 00:04:20,276
What do you have to lose?

87
00:04:22,727 --> 00:04:25,028
Except your sanity.

88

89
00:04:34,973 --> 00:04:36,472
You gonna tell me why we needed

90
00:04:36,474 --> 00:04:37,874
to come to the garage, Alfred?

91
00:04:37,876 --> 00:04:40,977
Happy birthday, Master Wayne.

92
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:43,680
You remembered.

93
00:04:43,682 --> 00:04:45,715
Of course I remembered.

94
00:04:45,717 --> 00:04:47,884
I bloody love your birthdays.

95
00:04:47,886 --> 00:04:49,969
Your seventh was an absolute blinder.

96
00:04:49,972 --> 00:04:52,188
Yeah, I remember you had
about 50 kids come up here,

97
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,857
but you were off outside, on your own.

98
00:04:54,859 --> 00:04:57,927
You were obsessed by this one
gift that your dad gave you...

99
00:04:57,929 --> 00:04:59,430
This bright red wagon.

100
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:01,864
You were in the garden all
day, collecting all these rocks.

101
00:05:01,866 --> 00:05:03,751
When I asked you what you
were gonna do with these rocks,

102
00:05:03,753 --> 00:05:07,603
you said, "I'm gonna build a home

103
00:05:07,605 --> 00:05:09,539
for my wagon.

104
00:05:09,548 --> 00:05:13,083
A secret place that only I know about."

105
00:05:26,719 --> 00:05:28,458
- What's this?
- Well, it's the reason why

106
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,560
I brought you out to
the garage, Master Bruce.

107
00:05:39,104 --> 00:05:41,237
Alfred, I don't know what to say.

108
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:46,976
V-8, five liter, 460 horsepower engine.

109
00:05:46,978 --> 00:05:49,545
Painted matte black, anti-reflective.

110
00:05:49,547 --> 00:05:51,047
Very difficult to see at night.

111
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,650
Oh, and, of course, this.

112
00:05:54,322 --> 00:05:56,227
100% bulletproof.

113
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,039
Best be prepared, eh?

114
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,117
Oh... Oh, mate.

115
00:06:17,554 --> 00:06:18,753
Jim, hey.

116
00:06:18,756 --> 00:06:19,719
What gives?

117
00:06:19,722 --> 00:06:20,922
The mayor and the police commissioner

118
00:06:20,924 --> 00:06:22,357
have been kidnapped by Jerome.

119
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,479
Got every cop in the city out there

120
00:06:24,482 --> 00:06:27,283
searching all the spots
Jerome's been seen the last week.

121
00:06:27,285 --> 00:06:28,785
You got something for me?

122
00:06:28,787 --> 00:06:30,453
I was gonna say I just
won a hundred bucks

123
00:06:30,455 --> 00:06:31,547
in the scratch-off lotto

124
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,822
at the liquor store, and we could go

125
00:06:32,824 --> 00:06:34,524
to the track with it, but, uh,

126
00:06:34,526 --> 00:06:36,426
we can do your thing first.

127
00:06:36,428 --> 00:06:38,494
- Gordon.
- We need to talk.

128
00:06:38,496 --> 00:06:40,329
Oswald?

129
00:06:40,331 --> 00:06:42,799
I'm out back. Come alone.

130
00:06:46,234 --> 00:06:48,656
Yeah. All right.

131
00:06:53,278 --> 00:06:54,510
Well, this is a first.

132
00:06:54,512 --> 00:06:56,435
Are you doing anything about Jerome?

133
00:06:56,438 --> 00:06:57,847
We're looking for him.

134
00:06:57,849 --> 00:06:59,515
Do you know where he is?

135
00:06:59,517 --> 00:07:01,731
And if I did, do you really
think I would just tell you?

136
00:07:01,734 --> 00:07:04,053
Have you march in there, guns blazing?

137
00:07:04,055 --> 00:07:05,822
He needs to be stopped.

138
00:07:05,824 --> 00:07:07,813
He has everyone under his thumb...

139
00:07:07,816 --> 00:07:09,959
Freeze, Firefly, Hatter.

140
00:07:09,961 --> 00:07:11,820
They are all part of his plan.

141
00:07:11,823 --> 00:07:13,529
A dark, terrible plan.

142
00:07:13,531 --> 00:07:14,797
Which is?

143
00:07:14,799 --> 00:07:17,900
Scarecrow has made a gas for him.

144
00:07:17,902 --> 00:07:19,902
- Like a fear toxin?
- Worse.

145
00:07:19,904 --> 00:07:21,124
Much worse.

146
00:07:21,127 --> 00:07:22,560
I saw it turn someone into

147
00:07:22,563 --> 00:07:25,374
a maniacal, cackling, violent animal.

148
00:07:25,376 --> 00:07:27,577
And what does he plan to do with it?

149
00:07:27,579 --> 00:07:29,045
He's smart. He hasn't shared

150
00:07:29,047 --> 00:07:30,646
the details of his plans with anyone.

151
00:07:30,648 --> 00:07:33,106
Instead, we all have a
separate task to perform.

152
00:07:33,109 --> 00:07:34,584
Such as?

153
00:07:34,586 --> 00:07:36,419
He has yet to give me my role.

154
00:07:36,421 --> 00:07:38,921
Why did you come here if
you're not gonna help me?

155
00:07:38,923 --> 00:07:41,070
He scares the living
hell out of me, okay?

156
00:07:42,494 --> 00:07:45,228
I mean, I was willing
to play along with him

157
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,305
for a while.

158
00:07:46,308 --> 00:07:48,196
Perhaps he had a way
to make us all rich?

159
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:50,766
A return to the good old days, you know?

160
00:07:50,768 --> 00:07:52,702
But nothing good will come of this.

161
00:07:52,704 --> 00:07:55,771
Or maybe you just don't
like the competition.

162
00:07:55,773 --> 00:07:57,373
Jerome casts quite the shadow.

163
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,672
Oh, please!

164
00:07:59,675 --> 00:08:02,125
He's a maniac, an anarchist.

165
00:08:02,128 --> 00:08:05,747
He is not interested in money or power.

166
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,653
And I am an honest criminal, Jim.

167
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:11,070
Where is he? Where is the gas?

168
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:13,173
He only tells you what he needs to,

169
00:08:13,176 --> 00:08:14,642
when he needs to.

170
00:08:14,645 --> 00:08:16,669
I just know he has to be stopped.

171
00:08:16,672 --> 00:08:18,060
Jim! Hey!

172
00:08:18,062 --> 00:08:20,863
You down here?! Jim?!

173
00:08:20,865 --> 00:08:23,477
- Yeah.
- Hey.

174
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,767
A uni just spotted Jerome
near Paisley Square.

175
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,570
All right, let's go.

176
00:08:31,543 --> 00:08:33,281
♪ Time has come today ♪

177
00:08:35,043 --> 00:08:37,911
♪ Young hearts can go their way ♪

178
00:08:37,914 --> 00:08:40,149

179

180
00:08:43,438 --> 00:08:45,154
♪ Time has come today... ♪

181
00:08:46,224 --> 00:08:47,757
Hey, what happened to my mic?

182
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,417
Hey, buddy, beat it, will ya?

183
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,617
I'm trying to work here.

184
00:08:51,329 --> 00:08:52,562
Whoo!

185
00:08:58,937 --> 00:09:01,571
Where's everyone going?

186
00:09:03,995 --> 00:09:07,125
Ladies and gentlemen, we are
the Arkham Asylum Lunatics.

187
00:09:07,128 --> 00:09:11,146
We came here to blow some minds! Whoo!

188
00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:14,750
Sorry to interrupt your little show,

189
00:09:14,752 --> 00:09:17,520
but you are gonna love this next one.

190
00:09:17,522 --> 00:09:21,023
Introducing Mayor Pritchard,

191
00:09:21,025 --> 00:09:22,959
Commissioner Reynolds,

192
00:09:22,961 --> 00:09:24,692
Archbishop McGregor,

193
00:09:24,695 --> 00:09:26,929
and this lady...

194
00:09:26,931 --> 00:09:28,464
whoever she is.

195
00:09:28,466 --> 00:09:30,102
This is everybody.

196
00:09:30,105 --> 00:09:32,320
Everybody, say hi.

197
00:09:32,323 --> 00:09:35,203
Now, as you can see,

198
00:09:35,206 --> 00:09:37,516
we're still waiting
for two guests of honor.

199
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,475
But in the meantime,
let's go over the rules

200
00:09:40,478 --> 00:09:41,777
of tonight's entertainment,

201
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:43,379
shall we?

202
00:09:43,381 --> 00:09:44,614
Dynamite.

203
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:47,550
Trigger.

204
00:09:47,552 --> 00:09:49,652
I don't get what I want?

205
00:09:49,654 --> 00:09:52,414
Boom. Headless people.

206
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:54,039
And if any of you are thinking

207
00:09:54,042 --> 00:09:56,484
of going anywhere, you'll die, too.

208
00:09:57,694 --> 00:10:00,719
Now, the one man who can
give me what I want...

209
00:10:00,722 --> 00:10:02,164
Come over here.

210
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,800
Calling Gordon.

211
00:10:04,802 --> 00:10:08,156
Calling Captain James Gordon.

212
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:16,759
I speak on behalf of myself

213
00:10:16,761 --> 00:10:19,461
and all other gang leaders in this city

214
00:10:19,463 --> 00:10:23,365
when I say your arrogance and disrespect

215
00:10:23,367 --> 00:10:26,769
will no longer be tolerated.

216
00:10:26,771 --> 00:10:31,073
You beat and then dragged
my brother from here

217
00:10:31,075 --> 00:10:32,918
like a dog.

218
00:10:32,921 --> 00:10:35,444
Your brother's an ass.

219
00:10:35,446 --> 00:10:38,547
He abuses our staff and refuses
to pay his exorbitant tab.

220
00:10:38,549 --> 00:10:40,655
He is my brother,

221
00:10:40,658 --> 00:10:43,121
and he demands your respect.

222
00:10:43,124 --> 00:10:44,827
And I suppose an apology

223
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,363
would be out of the question?

224
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:50,593
Your blood will be

225
00:10:50,596 --> 00:10:52,790
his apology.

226
00:10:52,793 --> 00:10:54,562
Thought so.

227
00:11:10,882 --> 00:11:12,655
Could've handled them.

228
00:11:12,658 --> 00:11:15,856
That's the advantage of having
your own personal army, Tabs...

229
00:11:15,859 --> 00:11:17,535
You don't have to.

230
00:11:17,538 --> 00:11:19,755
Isn't that right?

231
00:11:24,028 --> 00:11:26,295
What's wrong?

232
00:11:26,297 --> 00:11:29,090
Ra's al Ghul chose you, no one else,

233
00:11:29,093 --> 00:11:30,629
to pass on his spirit.

234
00:11:30,632 --> 00:11:33,302
We will serve you,
protect you, of course,

235
00:11:33,304 --> 00:11:35,370
but surely, you intend
to continue his legacy

236
00:11:35,372 --> 00:11:37,873
and not just remain here in this place?

237
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,675
What does that mean?

238
00:11:41,577 --> 00:11:43,479
"Continue his legacy."

239
00:11:43,481 --> 00:11:45,848
I like the sound of that.

240
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,117
As I told you...

241
00:11:48,119 --> 00:11:51,453
we have much more to show you.

242
00:11:51,455 --> 00:11:53,322
Are you ready?

243
00:11:53,324 --> 00:11:55,557
Yes.

244
00:12:05,669 --> 00:12:07,436
What the hell is that?

245
00:12:23,453 --> 00:12:27,543
Gentlemen, ladies, your assistance

246
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:30,192
is urgently required.

247
00:12:30,194 --> 00:12:32,632
Be careful... these are
very dangerous materials.

248
00:12:32,635 --> 00:12:34,635
Oh, we're counting on it.

249
00:12:35,716 --> 00:12:37,950
More laughing gas

250
00:12:37,953 --> 00:12:39,609
we need to make.

251
00:12:41,205 --> 00:12:42,304
What?

252
00:12:42,306 --> 00:12:44,439
There's no time to waste!

253
00:12:44,441 --> 00:12:47,609
We need it in bulk, you see.

254
00:12:47,611 --> 00:12:50,023
W-Well, how much of it do you need?

255
00:12:51,982 --> 00:12:53,882
Oh.

256
00:12:53,884 --> 00:12:55,450
This much.

257
00:13:10,667 --> 00:13:13,635
Ladies and gentlemen,
as I live and breathe,

258
00:13:13,637 --> 00:13:16,204
James Gordon is in the house.

259
00:13:18,609 --> 00:13:21,234
I'm not talking to you
until I can get up there

260
00:13:21,237 --> 00:13:23,645
and check on the
well-being of your hostages.

261
00:13:23,647 --> 00:13:26,481
First of all, Jim, you're late.

262
00:13:26,484 --> 00:13:30,676
Secondly, I think I'm the one
who should be making demands.

263
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:31,988
Don't you?

264
00:13:31,991 --> 00:13:34,780
What you're doing is an
act of terror, Valeska.

265
00:13:34,783 --> 00:13:36,863
- Yeah, you scumbag!
- Ask our mayor

266
00:13:36,866 --> 00:13:40,528
what this city's policy is on
negotiating with terrorists.

267
00:13:40,531 --> 00:13:41,696
Terrorist?

268
00:13:41,698 --> 00:13:43,532
Frankly, I'm offended.

269
00:13:43,534 --> 00:13:45,093
No, no, no!

270
00:13:45,096 --> 00:13:46,455
That's close enough, Gordon.

271
00:13:50,674 --> 00:13:54,342
And none of you go anywhere, either.

272
00:13:59,216 --> 00:14:00,916
Dead man's trigger.

273
00:14:02,077 --> 00:14:03,652
This falls out of my hand

274
00:14:03,654 --> 00:14:05,821
for any reason and...

275
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,522
bang!

276
00:14:09,026 --> 00:14:12,160
I got two empty chairs here.

277
00:14:12,162 --> 00:14:14,329
You haven't even asked
me who they're for yet.

278
00:14:14,331 --> 00:14:16,426
All right, I'll bite. Who are they for?

279
00:14:16,429 --> 00:14:18,093
Come on, James.

280
00:14:18,096 --> 00:14:19,668
You're a detective.

281
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,202
Do some detecting.

282
00:14:22,873 --> 00:14:25,474
Jeremiah, your brother.

283
00:14:25,476 --> 00:14:28,243
Bingo. That's one.

284
00:14:28,245 --> 00:14:30,574
- And the other?
- Well, the only other

285
00:14:30,577 --> 00:14:34,149
irksome do-gooder who's ever
spoiled my fun in this town.

286
00:14:35,926 --> 00:14:38,419
Bruce Wayne!

287
00:14:38,422 --> 00:14:40,822
No.

288
00:14:40,824 --> 00:14:42,491
No?

289
00:14:42,493 --> 00:14:43,968
You can take me.

290
00:14:43,971 --> 00:14:46,172
I'll sit up there with
one of those things

291
00:14:46,175 --> 00:14:48,624
around my neck, but I
won't let you have him.

292
00:14:48,627 --> 00:14:50,804
Well, I don't want you,

293
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,640
Jim.

294
00:14:52,643 --> 00:14:54,402
I want my brother

295
00:14:54,404 --> 00:14:55,949
and I want Bruce.

296
00:14:55,952 --> 00:14:57,405
I want them now.

297
00:14:57,407 --> 00:14:59,613
All right. Let me get
these people out of here,

298
00:14:59,616 --> 00:15:00,709
I'll come up there...

299
00:15:00,711 --> 00:15:02,066
You are not listening to me!

300
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,380
And that is forcing my hand.

301
00:15:09,553 --> 00:15:10,685
Jerome...

302
00:15:13,564 --> 00:15:14,622
No...

303
00:15:22,569 --> 00:15:24,766
Bring me my brother.

304
00:15:24,768 --> 00:15:28,270
Bring me Wayne.

305
00:15:28,272 --> 00:15:30,539
Bring 'em now.

You know, for a billionaire,
your security system is...

312
00:15:55,795 --> 00:15:56,995
lame.

313
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:58,532
Miss Kyle.

314
00:15:58,534 --> 00:16:00,267
Thank you, Alfred.

315
00:16:00,269 --> 00:16:01,502
Enjoy.

316
00:16:06,381 --> 00:16:08,042
Thank you.

317
00:16:08,044 --> 00:16:09,810
For what?

318
00:16:09,812 --> 00:16:12,146
Visiting me on my birthday.

319
00:16:12,148 --> 00:16:13,547
Oh.

320
00:16:13,549 --> 00:16:15,662
I actually didn't know
it was your birthday.

321
00:16:15,665 --> 00:16:19,115
I just happened to be
strolling in the neighborhood.

322
00:16:19,116 --> 00:16:21,373
- Mm-hmm.
Either way...

323
00:16:21,376 --> 00:16:23,410
it's good to see you.

324
00:16:31,998 --> 00:16:33,808
I knew it was an act.

325
00:16:35,171 --> 00:16:36,904
What?

326
00:16:36,906 --> 00:16:38,706
The brat...

327
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:41,873
and the drinking, the-the friends.

328
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:44,637
It was an act.

329
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,174
I think you're more
sure about that than me.

330
00:16:48,684 --> 00:16:50,709
Master Bruce,

331
00:16:50,712 --> 00:16:52,018
we have visitors.

332
00:16:52,021 --> 00:16:53,687
Bruce, we need your help.

333
00:16:53,689 --> 00:16:55,856
What happened?

334
00:16:57,467 --> 00:17:00,594
Don't you know it's rude
to keep a guy waiting?

335
00:17:00,596 --> 00:17:03,248
Bring me my hostages, James.

336
00:17:03,251 --> 00:17:06,866
My trigger finger is getting itchy.

337
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:10,442
The hostages he wants are his brother...

338
00:17:10,445 --> 00:17:12,014
and you.

339
00:17:12,017 --> 00:17:14,017
What, you have a laugh? No bloody way.

340
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,786
I don't like it any more than you do.

341
00:17:15,789 --> 00:17:17,475
But, Bruce, you have to trust me.

342
00:17:17,478 --> 00:17:18,959
Lucius and I have a plan.

343
00:17:18,962 --> 00:17:20,562
You know what?

344
00:17:20,565 --> 00:17:23,249
I don't think you're
taking me seriously enough.

345
00:17:23,252 --> 00:17:24,852
Well...

346
00:17:24,854 --> 00:17:26,720
all right.

347
00:17:26,722 --> 00:17:28,522
Let's see.

348
00:17:28,524 --> 00:17:30,257
Eeny meeny miny moe,

349
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:33,093
one of these people have got to... go.

350
00:17:36,732 --> 00:17:38,966
Oh, it's that guy.

351
00:17:38,968 --> 00:17:40,567
Oh, well.

352
00:17:41,665 --> 00:17:43,228
Did you see what just happened?

353
00:17:43,231 --> 00:17:44,772
That man's a raving bloody lunatic.

354
00:17:44,774 --> 00:17:46,907
- He can't be trusted.
- For once I agree with Alfred.

355
00:17:46,909 --> 00:17:48,375
Bruce, listen to me.

356
00:17:48,377 --> 00:17:50,615
With your help, we can
prevent more deaths.

357
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:55,631
What's the plan?

358
00:17:57,256 --> 00:17:59,586
Jerome is using a
shortwave radio trigger

359
00:17:59,588 --> 00:18:01,488
with a dead man's
switch... If we can cut

360
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,779
the signal, he won't be able
to activate the explosives.

361
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:05,709
This emits a powerful
signal that disables

362
00:18:05,712 --> 00:18:07,279
all radio waves close to it.

363
00:18:07,282 --> 00:18:09,716
Once within a few feet of
Jerome's device, his trigger

364
00:18:09,719 --> 00:18:11,387
- will be useless.
- That will give us the time

365
00:18:11,389 --> 00:18:12,792
for the snipers to get a clean shot

366
00:18:12,795 --> 00:18:14,248
on Jerome, Firefly and the others.

367
00:18:14,251 --> 00:18:16,234
If I wear this, that gives
you time to take them out.

368
00:18:16,236 --> 00:18:17,303
Correct.

369
00:18:17,306 --> 00:18:19,106
Are you sure it's gonna work?

370
00:18:19,108 --> 00:18:20,441
I'm positive.

371
00:18:21,693 --> 00:18:23,092
99% positive.

372
00:18:24,607 --> 00:18:26,073
What are we waiting for?

373
00:18:26,076 --> 00:18:27,614
Those people need our help.

374
00:18:27,616 --> 00:18:29,249
Good man.

375
00:18:33,806 --> 00:18:37,591
Ra's owned this house for as
long as this city has existed.

376
00:18:37,593 --> 00:18:40,130
He said he kept his secrets in here.

377
00:18:40,133 --> 00:18:42,596
Ancient secrets.

378
00:18:42,598 --> 00:18:45,966
None of us have ever seen
what's behind this door.

379
00:18:45,968 --> 00:18:47,768
It remains locked,

380
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:50,170
and there is no key.

381
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:51,743
Tried dynamite?

382
00:18:54,182 --> 00:18:55,515
No need.

383
00:19:00,483 --> 00:19:02,094
Our master chose you

384
00:19:02,097 --> 00:19:03,984
for a reason.

385
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,387
All my life...

386
00:20:13,389 --> 00:20:17,257
I have known that I was meant for more.

387
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:20,318
That there was something
deep inside of me

388
00:20:20,321 --> 00:20:22,262
that I couldn't explain.

389
00:20:38,977 --> 00:20:41,081
I'm home.

390
00:20:50,336 --> 00:20:53,460
Sir, we got target in sight.

391
00:20:53,462 --> 00:20:55,596
No way in from below the stage.

392
00:20:55,598 --> 00:20:57,331
Four of my men have found positions.

393
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:58,305
Good.

394
00:20:58,308 --> 00:20:59,937
Stay low, hang tight.

395
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,435
No hair triggers.

396
00:21:01,437 --> 00:21:03,904
One missed shot means adios Mayor.

397
00:21:03,906 --> 00:21:05,839
Copy that.

398
00:21:05,841 --> 00:21:07,574
Standing by.

399
00:21:07,576 --> 00:21:09,505
I watch the news.

400
00:21:09,508 --> 00:21:11,055
I know why you're here, Mr. Gordon.

401
00:21:11,058 --> 00:21:12,909
And you must be out of
your mind if you think

402
00:21:12,912 --> 00:21:15,078
I'm gonna be led like
a lamb to slaughter.

403
00:21:15,081 --> 00:21:18,251
I understand your concern,
but your brother doesn't bluff.

404
00:21:18,254 --> 00:21:19,749
If we ignore his demands,

405
00:21:19,752 --> 00:21:21,391
there's no telling what he might do.

406
00:21:21,394 --> 00:21:24,090
- We can block his remote's signal with this.
- Thanks.

407
00:21:24,093 --> 00:21:26,399
If you and Bruce can get
within a few feet of him,

408
00:21:26,402 --> 00:21:28,836
it will disable his remote...
He'll be a sitting duck.

409
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:31,597
- Our snipers can take it from there.
- For God's sake, Gordon,

410
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,333
you have to know what he wants.

411
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:35,702
To... murder us both

412
00:21:35,704 --> 00:21:37,771
on live television.

413
00:21:37,773 --> 00:21:39,840
Mr. Valeska.

414
00:21:39,842 --> 00:21:41,475
I'm Bruce Wayne.

415
00:21:41,477 --> 00:21:43,477
It's a pleasure to meet you.

416
00:21:43,479 --> 00:21:47,138
Likewise. I... wish the
circumstances were better.

417
00:21:47,141 --> 00:21:49,284
May I ask what it is
you've been working on?

418
00:21:50,552 --> 00:21:51,797
Um, yeah.

419
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,786
It's a compact electrical engine.

420
00:21:53,789 --> 00:21:55,188
It generates power.

421
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,469
Fascinating.

422
00:21:56,472 --> 00:21:57,680
How much power?

423
00:21:57,683 --> 00:21:59,292
Just two could light up every building

424
00:21:59,295 --> 00:22:00,894
south of Westward Bridge.

425
00:22:00,896 --> 00:22:03,363
You have a brilliant mind.

426
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:05,565
And we all hope we can soon

427
00:22:05,567 --> 00:22:07,367
be rid of your brother,
so that you can carry out

428
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:08,969
your work free from fear.

429
00:22:08,971 --> 00:22:11,297
I understand if you choose
not to help us today.

430
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:14,573
But I trust that Captain
Gordon and Mr. Fox

431
00:22:14,576 --> 00:22:16,376
will see that no harm comes to me.

432
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:18,945
But even if it does...

433
00:22:20,674 --> 00:22:22,539
maybe, by facing Jerome...

434
00:22:24,019 --> 00:22:25,719
I can show the people of Gotham

435
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:27,154
that standing up to terror

436
00:22:27,156 --> 00:22:29,414
is the only way to take its power away.

437
00:22:39,168 --> 00:22:41,535
Well said.

438
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,578
Harvey?

439
00:22:46,581 --> 00:22:48,130
Hey. Just got word

440
00:22:48,132 --> 00:22:49,638
that Freeze and Scarecrow broke into

441
00:22:49,641 --> 00:22:51,364
Wayne Industries' chemical lab.

442
00:22:51,367 --> 00:22:52,696
Jerome's playing the long game, here,

443
00:22:52,698 --> 00:22:53,914
but we're not gonna be sure what it is

444
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:56,083
- unless we get ahead of him.
- The gas.

445
00:22:56,085 --> 00:22:58,583
Penguin told me about
a new Scarecrow toxin.

446
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:00,887
Head over to the lab, we're
on our way to the Square.

447
00:23:02,524 --> 00:23:03,924
They've got a weapon.

448
00:23:03,926 --> 00:23:05,625
Poison gas.

449
00:23:05,627 --> 00:23:07,861
Okay, let's go.

450
00:23:07,863 --> 00:23:09,363
Thank you.

451
00:23:15,471 --> 00:23:17,003
You two.

452
00:23:23,312 --> 00:23:24,945
Hey!

453
00:23:24,947 --> 00:23:26,079
Hey, buddy.

454
00:23:26,081 --> 00:23:28,048
What happened?

455
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:29,261
What's so funny?

456
00:23:29,264 --> 00:23:30,763
No, no, no, no, no!

457
00:23:33,555 --> 00:23:35,322
Ma'am.

458
00:23:35,324 --> 00:23:36,890
Let me help you.

459
00:23:36,892 --> 00:23:37,991
What happened?

460
00:23:37,993 --> 00:23:39,426
They made us make it.

461
00:23:39,428 --> 00:23:40,683
Tons of it.

462
00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:41,823
Where is it?

463
00:23:41,826 --> 00:23:42,896
It's gone.

464
00:23:42,898 --> 00:23:44,264
They took it.

465
00:23:46,101 --> 00:23:48,335
♪ Why are we waiting? ♪

466
00:23:48,337 --> 00:23:50,150
♪ Waiting, waiting,
waiting, waiting ♪

467
00:23:50,153 --> 00:23:51,844
♪ Someone's gonna die! ♪

468
00:23:53,342 --> 00:23:55,075
Well.

469
00:23:55,077 --> 00:23:57,978
Look who decided to show up.

470
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:00,480
We were starting to get nervous.

471
00:24:00,482 --> 00:24:02,082
Especially, the mayor here.

472
00:24:02,084 --> 00:24:04,117
My guests of honor,

473
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:07,417
please, take your seats onstage.

474
00:24:17,466 --> 00:24:18,999
Come on.

475
00:24:19,001 --> 00:24:20,834
Don't be shy.

476
00:24:20,836 --> 00:24:22,402
It's all right.

477
00:24:27,876 --> 00:24:29,823
We don't have all day.

478
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:39,686
It's activated, just let
them get a little closer.

479
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:41,788
On my command.

480
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:45,058
My men have all targets in view.

481
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,777
Standing by.

482
00:24:52,745 --> 00:24:54,652
Hi, brother.

483
00:25:05,747 --> 00:25:07,566
- Now.
- Fire.

484
00:25:07,569 --> 00:25:09,235
All targets, fire!

485
00:25:16,191 --> 00:25:19,759
I had my guys take up the
best vantage points last night.

486
00:25:19,761 --> 00:25:24,667
So they've been watching
your little SWAT team all day.

487
00:25:27,189 --> 00:25:30,524
Now, Bruce, brother dear.

488
00:25:30,527 --> 00:25:32,639
Get up onstage.

489
00:25:35,627 --> 00:25:38,009
It's time to get this
party really started, huh?

490
00:25:44,964 --> 00:25:46,449
What are you doing here?

491
00:25:46,452 --> 00:25:48,347
This is a restricted area.

492
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:51,318
Our cargo is too precious to waste.

493
00:25:53,189 --> 00:25:55,837
Let me give you something I like to keep

494
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,625
up my sleeves for times just like these.

495
00:26:02,965 --> 00:26:05,199
Oh, my God!

496
00:26:05,201 --> 00:26:07,701
You can pilot this
contraption alone, sir?

497
00:26:07,703 --> 00:26:08,969
Yes.

498
00:26:08,971 --> 00:26:11,171
Then, look into my eyes.

499
00:26:18,047 --> 00:26:21,682
The kidnappings, the
concert in the Square.

500
00:26:21,684 --> 00:26:23,317
All to draw the biggest crowds,

501
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:25,319
so we can drop the laughing gas on them?

502
00:26:25,321 --> 00:26:27,637
This is madness.

503
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,039
I thought

504
00:26:29,042 --> 00:26:32,058
you'd appreciate the beauty of it all.

505
00:26:32,061 --> 00:26:34,027
But Jerome was right.

506
00:26:34,029 --> 00:26:37,164
You know, he anticipated your betrayal?

507
00:26:37,166 --> 00:26:38,556
That's right.

508
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,467
You went to Gordon.

509
00:26:42,004 --> 00:26:43,070
Judas.

510
00:26:44,809 --> 00:26:46,540
Tie him up,

511
00:26:46,542 --> 00:26:48,418
put him on the blimp.

512
00:26:48,421 --> 00:26:49,853
Jerome wants him to have

513
00:26:49,856 --> 00:26:51,512
a bird's-eye view.

514
00:26:57,416 --> 00:27:01,120
This book tracks Ra's legacy
dating back nine centuries.

515
00:27:01,123 --> 00:27:03,390
Did you know he not only
overthrew governments,

516
00:27:03,392 --> 00:27:05,459
but infiltrated royal families?

517
00:27:05,461 --> 00:27:08,028
Ra's influenced history.

518
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:11,865
He was a cult leader, and he
still has them brainwashed.

519
00:27:11,867 --> 00:27:13,967
And what about me, am I brainwashed?

520
00:27:13,969 --> 00:27:15,949
There are things written here

521
00:27:15,952 --> 00:27:19,472
that could change the way
we view the past forever.

522
00:27:19,475 --> 00:27:23,293
Perhaps, I am the one to
bring that change to light.

523
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:29,735
Look. This book was compiled
by shamans and mystics

524
00:27:29,738 --> 00:27:31,785
from all over Eastern
Asia and the Middle East.

525
00:27:31,787 --> 00:27:33,801
Shamans and mystics? Give me a break.

526
00:27:33,804 --> 00:27:36,789
It contains formulas for
potions and incantations

527
00:27:36,792 --> 00:27:38,225
said to raise demons,

528
00:27:38,227 --> 00:27:40,460
curse our enemies and contact the dead.

529
00:27:40,462 --> 00:27:41,637
This isn't you.

530
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,941
The Barbara I know would've already sold

531
00:27:42,943 --> 00:27:44,597
all of this junk to the highest bidder.

532
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,681
Junk?

533
00:27:45,684 --> 00:27:47,834
This is my destiny.

534
00:27:47,836 --> 00:27:49,603
And being with me and
Selina at the club?

535
00:27:49,605 --> 00:27:50,737
That isn't?

536
00:27:50,739 --> 00:27:52,406
You begged me

537
00:27:52,408 --> 00:27:53,715
to partner with you.

538
00:27:53,718 --> 00:27:55,431
Can't you see who that is up there?

539
00:27:55,434 --> 00:27:58,160
That is me and Ra's, 400 years ago.

540
00:27:58,163 --> 00:28:00,220
Oh, please, I mean, she
doesn't even look like you.

541
00:28:00,223 --> 00:28:01,762
It looks exactly like me.

542
00:28:01,765 --> 00:28:03,250
It is me.

543
00:28:03,252 --> 00:28:06,920
I have finally found my true purpose.

544
00:28:06,922 --> 00:28:09,426
I'm not gonna let your
jealousy distract me.

545
00:28:09,429 --> 00:28:12,992
Ladies, escort Miss
Galavan to the street.

546
00:28:12,995 --> 00:28:14,795
I'll show myself out.

547
00:28:14,797 --> 00:28:16,763
Actually, I think it's time

548
00:28:16,765 --> 00:28:19,800
my loyal servants
taught you some manners.

549
00:28:19,802 --> 00:28:20,981
Why don't you do it?

550
00:28:20,984 --> 00:28:23,590
Because I am the one true heir

551
00:28:23,593 --> 00:28:27,429
of an immortal god's ancient dynasty.

552
00:28:27,432 --> 00:28:30,762
And I don't dirty my fingers
with the likes of you anymore.

553
00:28:42,106 --> 00:28:43,991
No parent will admit it,

554
00:28:43,993 --> 00:28:47,661
but everyone's got their favorites.

555
00:28:47,663 --> 00:28:49,596
Right, brother?

556
00:28:55,082 --> 00:28:58,872
The one who cleans their
room, does their homework,

557
00:28:58,874 --> 00:29:00,874
doesn't try to kill everybody.

558
00:29:00,876 --> 00:29:03,243
Little Mr. Perfect here.

559
00:29:03,245 --> 00:29:04,711
Yeah.

560
00:29:04,713 --> 00:29:06,221
He was that guy.

561
00:29:06,223 --> 00:29:08,582
He got adopted by rich folks.

562
00:29:08,584 --> 00:29:10,027
Went to the top schools,

563
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:11,585
then, a top college.

564
00:29:11,587 --> 00:29:13,610
Meanwhile, I got dragged

565
00:29:13,613 --> 00:29:16,488
through the circus by my
depressed alcoholic mother.

566
00:29:16,491 --> 00:29:19,001
Forced to clean up
elephant dung every day.

567
00:29:19,003 --> 00:29:20,509
Who cares?!

568
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:22,162
Do you know how big

569
00:29:22,164 --> 00:29:23,905
those things are, folks?

570
00:29:23,907 --> 00:29:26,166
But I know something

571
00:29:26,168 --> 00:29:28,965
that Mommy and Daddy,

572
00:29:28,968 --> 00:29:30,885
they never knew.

573
00:29:32,449 --> 00:29:35,527
You're as crazy as I am.

574
00:29:42,127 --> 00:29:45,053
It's in your DNA.

575
00:29:48,023 --> 00:29:51,925
See, we got the same blood

576
00:29:51,927 --> 00:29:53,426
running through us.

577
00:29:53,429 --> 00:29:57,196
We are practically identical.

578
00:29:57,199 --> 00:30:00,367
You are a killer.

579
00:30:00,369 --> 00:30:02,202
It's your nature.

580
00:30:04,373 --> 00:30:05,906
Stop trying to fight it.

581
00:30:19,024 --> 00:30:22,051
Take your best shot. Hmm...

582
00:30:30,215 --> 00:30:31,723
Hey! What the hell happened?

583
00:30:31,726 --> 00:30:32,901
The snipers are dead.

584
00:30:32,904 --> 00:30:34,840
Get up on the roof,
take as many as you can.

585
00:30:34,843 --> 00:30:36,912
All right. Just know, a bunch of
chemicals are heading this way.

586
00:30:36,914 --> 00:30:39,239
Scarecrow had the Wayne
chemists mix it up.

587
00:30:41,343 --> 00:30:42,832
That's why he's been stalling.

588
00:30:42,835 --> 00:30:44,819
He wants a big crowd. He's gonna release

589
00:30:44,822 --> 00:30:46,488
the laughing gas right here.

590
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:48,290
We need to evacuate the area!

591
00:30:48,292 --> 00:30:49,918
Get these people out of here!

592
00:30:49,921 --> 00:30:52,188
Do whatever you have
to! Get them out of here!

593
00:30:52,191 --> 00:30:54,863
It's time to kill this
maniac once and for all.

594
00:30:58,664 --> 00:31:00,360
That was so good!

595
00:31:00,363 --> 00:31:01,899
I love you!

596
00:31:40,351 --> 00:31:42,590
Hey, look up in the sky!

597
00:32:11,673 --> 00:32:13,072
Holy crap.

598
00:32:14,143 --> 00:32:16,875
E-Excuse me, sir, could you help me?

599
00:32:16,878 --> 00:32:19,378
No can do, sport.

600
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:23,149
Got to get this rig into
position for the boss.

601
00:32:23,151 --> 00:32:25,217
And where is that?

602
00:32:25,219 --> 00:32:27,653
Paisley Square.

603
00:32:27,655 --> 00:32:30,189
Almost there.

604
00:32:30,191 --> 00:32:32,692
Then, I can drop the load.

605
00:32:32,694 --> 00:32:34,738
With this lever.

606
00:32:38,925 --> 00:32:41,282
Now, you turn this
thing around right now!

607
00:32:41,285 --> 00:32:43,069
Can you not see...

608
00:32:43,071 --> 00:32:45,433
Like I said, pal,

609
00:32:45,436 --> 00:32:47,983
no can do.

610
00:33:05,426 --> 00:33:06,859
Keep coming!

611
00:33:06,861 --> 00:33:09,066
Get into position.

612
00:33:14,378 --> 00:33:16,645
Holy moly.

613
00:33:17,437 --> 00:33:20,472
Holy moly.

614
00:33:20,475 --> 00:33:22,027
Jim, are you seeing this?

615
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,864
Yeah. Get everyone out of here.

616
00:33:23,867 --> 00:33:25,542
I'm going after Jerome.

617
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:27,912
I can take it down with a shot.

618
00:33:27,915 --> 00:33:29,582
And risk spilling the chemicals?

619
00:33:29,585 --> 00:33:31,952
Oh, yeah, right.

620
00:33:38,998 --> 00:33:40,450
Oswald?

621
00:33:40,453 --> 00:33:42,086
Jim, Jim, help me.

622
00:33:42,089 --> 00:33:45,200
They knocked me out and-and-and
now I am in some blimp

623
00:33:45,203 --> 00:33:47,932
with-with that horrible
gas and-and the pilot,

624
00:33:47,935 --> 00:33:50,125
he's been hypnotized and I-I don't...

625
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:51,303
You're on the blimp?

626
00:33:51,305 --> 00:33:52,371
Yes.

627
00:33:52,373 --> 00:33:53,906
Yes. You have to help me.

628
00:33:53,908 --> 00:33:55,925
No, no, no.

629
00:33:55,928 --> 00:33:57,527
You're gonna help us.

630
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:58,956
You're near the river.

631
00:33:58,959 --> 00:34:00,706
I need you to steer it over there.

632
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:05,151
Steer a blimp?!

633
00:34:05,154 --> 00:34:07,462
Are you out of your mind, Jim?!

634
00:34:07,465 --> 00:34:09,668
I don't even drive my own car.

635
00:34:09,671 --> 00:34:12,316
If you don't, thousands
will die, maybe worse.

636
00:34:12,319 --> 00:34:14,533
What's worse than that?

637
00:34:14,536 --> 00:34:17,804
How can you run an empire
in a city full of lunatics?

638
00:34:24,972 --> 00:34:26,371
Hands up.

639
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:31,910
Beautiful, isn't she?

640
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:38,288
Just give me a second.

641
00:34:38,291 --> 00:34:39,420
Got to call the pilot.

642
00:34:39,423 --> 00:34:40,722
Tell him he's in position.

643
00:34:41,877 --> 00:34:43,986
Yes, Jerome.

644
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:45,194
Not cool.

645
00:34:45,197 --> 00:34:47,559
Jerome? Jerome?

646
00:34:47,561 --> 00:34:50,241
I'm in position.

647
00:34:50,244 --> 00:34:52,110
It doesn't matter.

648
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,850
Too late, anyway.

649
00:34:55,853 --> 00:34:57,018
Bombs away!

650
00:35:03,779 --> 00:35:05,500
Funny.

651
00:35:11,152 --> 00:35:12,951
No!

652
00:35:31,505 --> 00:35:34,273
Okay, okay. Uh... um, up, up, up.

653
00:35:34,275 --> 00:35:37,810
Up, up, up. Oh! Oh...

654
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:41,837
Oh, okay.

655
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,870
Okay. Okay. Okay.

656
00:35:43,873 --> 00:35:47,221
River, river. Where is the river?

657
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:55,859
Quite the dilemma, Jim.

658
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:58,296
You gonna let me fall and die?

659
00:35:59,967 --> 00:36:02,806
Or are you gonna pull
me up and arrest me?

660
00:36:05,306 --> 00:36:06,916
What's it gonna be?

661
00:36:09,642 --> 00:36:13,043
Lawman or murderer?

662
00:36:20,655 --> 00:36:22,054
Ah.

663
00:36:23,575 --> 00:36:25,196
Good ol' Gordon.

664
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:27,825
Always playing by the rules.

665
00:36:27,828 --> 00:36:31,830
That's why I'll outlive you.

666
00:36:31,832 --> 00:36:33,502
That's why I'm loved

667
00:36:33,505 --> 00:36:36,701
'cause I don't give a
damn about the rules.

668
00:36:36,704 --> 00:36:38,885
It's a long way down.

669
00:36:38,888 --> 00:36:40,431
You sure you'll outlive me?

670
00:36:40,434 --> 00:36:42,346
Oh, I'm sure

671
00:36:42,349 --> 00:36:44,533
'cause I'm more than a man.

672
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:48,022
I'm an idea, a philosophy.

673
00:36:48,025 --> 00:36:50,353
And I will live on in the shadows

674
00:36:50,356 --> 00:36:52,721
within Gotham's discontent.

675
00:36:57,992 --> 00:37:00,025
You'll be seeing me soon.

676
00:37:00,027 --> 00:37:01,994
Au revoir.

677
00:37:21,451 --> 00:37:23,183
Never thought I'd see this.

678
00:37:23,186 --> 00:37:24,252
Sure is dead.

679
00:37:24,255 --> 00:37:25,790
Yeah, but is he?

680
00:37:25,793 --> 00:37:28,527
Yeah.

681
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:30,964
Get back!

682
00:37:30,967 --> 00:37:33,000
GCPD. Everybody get back.

683
00:38:03,618 --> 00:38:06,986
Mr. Valeska.

684
00:38:06,988 --> 00:38:09,689
I meant what I said about
your work being of importance

685
00:38:09,691 --> 00:38:12,339
to this city.

686
00:38:12,342 --> 00:38:14,949
Let Wayne Enterprises fund
your work with a grant.

687
00:38:19,511 --> 00:38:21,292
Thank you.

688
00:38:34,649 --> 00:38:36,683
Captain.

689
00:38:43,859 --> 00:38:45,792
Oswald.

690
00:38:45,794 --> 00:38:49,355
Um, hello. Still here.

691
00:38:49,358 --> 00:38:52,799
Will someone please get me
the hell off of this thing?

692
00:38:55,337 --> 00:38:56,980
Uh, we're on it.

693
00:38:59,741 --> 00:39:02,575
How do we get a blimp down
safely from over a river?

694
00:39:02,577 --> 00:39:04,477
You asking me? I say we let him

695
00:39:04,479 --> 00:39:06,472
stew up there for a few more hours.

696
00:39:07,882 --> 00:39:10,472
We'll get ahold of the standby pilot.

697
00:39:10,475 --> 00:39:11,704
Have him advise.

698
00:39:11,707 --> 00:39:13,073
Sit tight, all right?

699
00:39:13,076 --> 00:39:16,577
Oh, and Oswald Cobblepot,

700
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:17,980
Gotham thanks you.

701
00:39:17,983 --> 00:39:19,103
Wait, wait, Jim.

702
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:21,193
Jim. Jim?

703
00:39:21,196 --> 00:39:24,097
Jim. Jim!

704
00:39:24,099 --> 00:39:27,574
Jim...!

705
00:39:34,415 --> 00:39:36,308
Never touch me again.

706
00:39:36,311 --> 00:39:38,510
Miss Kean has a new path to take now.

707
00:39:38,513 --> 00:39:40,446
It no longer involves you.

708
00:39:40,448 --> 00:39:42,682
- Is that so?
- We will accept you leaving this city

709
00:39:42,684 --> 00:39:44,144
and never coming back.

710
00:39:44,147 --> 00:39:46,824
The only thing I'll accept
is you kissing my ass.

711
00:39:46,827 --> 00:39:48,921
We have been trained
by the League of Shadows

712
00:39:48,924 --> 00:39:50,816
in 90 different forms of combat

713
00:39:50,819 --> 00:39:52,910
- since we were five years old.
- Oh, yeah?

714
00:39:52,913 --> 00:39:55,160
Which one of you bitches
wants to go first?

715
00:40:10,745 --> 00:40:12,078
Next time

716
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,574
we kill you.

717
00:40:33,321 --> 00:40:35,087
Let me help you.

718
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:47,412
Who the hell are you guys?

719
00:40:47,415 --> 00:40:49,015
The ones that have been watching you

720
00:40:49,017 --> 00:40:52,071
and Barbara Kean, the
imposter, for quite some time.

721
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:54,921
We serve the one and only true master,

722
00:40:54,923 --> 00:40:56,923
Ra's al Ghul.

723
00:40:56,925 --> 00:40:58,958
But he's dead.

724
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,190
Death is only an illusion.

725
00:41:01,193 --> 00:41:02,559
Aah.

726
00:42:24,983 --> 00:42:27,045
Hello, brother.

727
00:42:27,048 --> 00:42:29,349
Didn't think you could
get rid of me so easily,

728
00:42:29,351 --> 00:42:30,883
did you?

729
00:42:30,885 --> 00:42:33,657
See, my days were numbered,

730
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,521
but you...

731
00:42:35,523 --> 00:42:39,191
oh, you will continue on for me,

732
00:42:39,194 --> 00:42:41,532
be my ultimate revenge.

733
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:44,641
So... calm yourself.

734
00:42:44,644 --> 00:42:46,144
Don't fight it.

735
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:48,154
Breathe it in.

736
00:42:48,157 --> 00:42:50,950
This gas was a special
mixture I had made

737
00:42:50,953 --> 00:42:52,882
just for you.

738
00:42:52,885 --> 00:42:56,322
Something to finally set you free.

739
00:42:56,325 --> 00:42:59,383
It's time to have some fun.

740
00:42:59,386 --> 00:43:01,780
Burn it down, brother.

741
00:43:01,783 --> 00:43:04,383
Burn it all down.

742
00:43:05,674 --> 00:43:10,869
