1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,640
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,120
Oh, crud.

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,560
He killed my mother, Jim.
He had her murdered in front of me.

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,360
I am going to kill you.

5
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:09,680
Think I found something.

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,880
The week of his murder,

7
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,120
he was supposed to meet
a woman named Karen Jennings

8
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,040
about something
called Pinewood Farms.

9
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,840
Pinewood Farms was a bio-engineering
program at Wayne Enterprises.

10
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,080
It started up again, didn't it?

11
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,360
That's why my father came to see you
after all those years.

12
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,920
Karen Jennings is gonna be dead
the minute she hits Blackgate prison.

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,240
That's why we're gonna break her out.

14
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,160
The man who contracted Matches
Malone to kill your parents

15
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,680
called himself "The Philosopher."

16
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,600
And I'd be willing to bet that this
is the man who's behind Pinewood.

17
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,200
"Hugo Strange, The Philosopher."

18
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,360
He runs Arkham now.

19
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,120
We brought someone back.

20
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,760
Azrael!

21
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,400
We actually did it.

22
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,000
Rally to me. Rally...

23
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,360
St. Dumas will deliver us.

24
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,080
Dumas will deliver us.

25
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,680
Rally. Heathens.

26
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,400
And Dumas will protect us.

27
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:17,040
Heathens, idolaters,
Spawn of Satan, prepare to die!

28
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,320
No, no. No, don't. Please.

29
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,120
Sister, speak to me, please.
Please, speak to me.

30
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,560
Who are you, huh?

31
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,920
<i>Who are you?</i>

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,920
Has there been any improvement
since he woke up yesterday?

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
No.

34
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,480
But he is wonderful, isn't he?

35
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,120
Who are you?

36
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,720
Who are you?

37
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,280
Strong as an ox, fast as a snake.

38
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,720
Mad as a hatter.

39
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,000
There's not much use bringing back
the dead if they come back crazy.

40
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,600
Oh, he's not crazy.

41
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,640
He just doesn't know who he is.

42
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,440
His psyche can't reconcile
being brought back from the dead.

43
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,640
It's fractured,
grasping at fragmented memories.

44
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,440
The text that he has written
on the walls

45
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,040
are all verses from this book.

46
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,240
<i>The Will and Order of St. Dumas.</i>

47
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,720
The Galavan family
is proudly descended

48
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,000
from 12th-century crusading knights.

49
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,120
This is their sacred text.

50
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,800
Evidently, our patient has memorized
the whole book.

51
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,480
His brain is struggling
to rebuild a coherent self,

52
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,160
but he's using the wrong parts.

53
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,880
So, what's the cure?

54
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,760
Good question.

55
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,840
What is it?

56
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,360
Mr. Gordon.

57
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,720
Professor Strange.

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,600
Sorry to drop by unexpected.

59
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,600
Oh, not at all. Please, have a seat.

60
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,240
To what do I owe the pleasure?

61
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,760
I've been hired by a client
to look into something.

62
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,040
I was hoping
you could help me with it.

63
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,120
Of course.

64
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,920
This is Karen Jennings.

65
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,720
She was murdered last night.

66
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,880
Oh, how tragic.

67
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,480
She was a test subject

68
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,440
in an old Wayne Enterprises program
called Pinewood Farms.

69
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,160
Before she passed, Karen mentioned
you were involved with the program.

70
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,760
That was a long time ago.

71
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,120
Try and remember.

72
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,840
If you can.

73
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,920
Pinewood Farms was started
by Thomas Wayne

74
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,040
in an attempt to cure
humanity's greatest ailments

75
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,400
on the genetic level:

76
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,320
old age, disease, even death.

77
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,360
But that's not what happened, is it?

78
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,560
Karen said the program
tried to play God,

79
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,800
and you ended up creating monsters.

80
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,720
I was just a researcher

81
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,360
with no knowledge of that
until it was too late.

82
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,080
A man of your skill and expertise
a lowly researcher?

83
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,000
Find that hard to believe.

84
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,720
But it's true.

85
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,600
Mr. Wayne excelled

86
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,520
at compartmentalizing
every aspect of his life.

87
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,800
Within Pinewood,
the left hand often didn't know

88
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,000
what the right was doing.

89
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,720
He lied to us all.

90
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,040
Not many people would see you
as the victim here.

91
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,680
I was one of the ones
who forced Thomas Wayne

92
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,040
to shut down the program,

93
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,120
but by then...

94
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,440
so many people had been hurt.

95
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,760
I have a theory.

96
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,080
I believe you ran Pinewood Farms.

97
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,360
I believe you've restarted the
program and I would like to know...

98
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,720
Why are you really here, Mr. Gordon?

99
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,960
Excuse me?

100
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,440
This whole city
has turned its back on you,

101
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,440
despite you risking your life
to save it over and over again.

102
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,880
I'm not here for a therapy session,
Professor.

103
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,000
No. It's more like an interrogation

104
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,200
by a man who's no longer
a police officer.

105
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,400
Who no longer has the right
to demand answers.

106
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,640
The only reason you're sitting
in that chair is because I allow it.

107
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:56,520
So let me ask you, why are you here?

108
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,840
Like I said, I have a client.

109
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,560
Bruce Wayne, I suppose.

110
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,560
So it's a job?

111
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,480
You're here to pay the rent?

112
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,720
Surely not.

113
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,680
All that's happened to you
this last year...

114
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:18,560
Hero cop found guilty of murder,
sentenced unjustly to Blackgate,

115
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,520
and now you return to what?

116
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,760
You've lost everything.

117
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,880
You're trying to make up
for the sins of your past,

118
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,920
and you believe that this case
will somehow bring about

119
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,280
- your own personal redemption.
- No.

120
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,320
You're not doing this
for your client.

121
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,880
You're doing this for yourself.

122
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,960
You're wrong.

123
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,400
You just exhibited several tells.

124
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,920
Facial tics, expressions
and eye movements

125
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,800
that people involuntarily
betray themselves with when they lie.

126
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,840
Let's talk about Victor Fries.

127
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,360
Victor Fries is dead, Mr. Gordon.

128
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,840
Really? I saw him last night.

129
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,680
That's impossible.

130
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,480
This is a court order

131
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,400
signed by District Attorney Dent
to exhume Fries' body.

132
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Where is it buried?

133
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,480
He was cremated.

134
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,920
Thank you.

135
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,760
For what?

136
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,000
I can read tells, too.

137
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,880
You're lying.

138
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,480
I needed to be sure
you were behind all this,

139
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,200
and now I am.

140
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,200
Don't lie! I heard you!

141
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,640
Don't. Please.

142
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,200
- There you go.
- Don't.

143
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,360
Please do! Squeeze the life from him!

144
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,800
Kill him! Kill him now!

145
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,160
- Are you two fighting again?
- He called me fat!

146
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,960
I didn't do anything! It wasn't me!

147
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,320
It, it was Lucy.

148
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,720
The fifth personality again.

149
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,400
Such a nasty attitude.

150
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,720
See, this gets complicated.

151
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,920
See, Lucy is in his head,

152
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,120
because Rudy has what's called
multiple personality...

153
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,200
In his head?

154
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,720
- Then I'll pull her out!
- No... no!

155
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,880
She's... she's a... she's a ghost.

156
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,240
- A ghost...
- Yes.

157
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,760
And she makes Rudy say things
that he doesn't wanna say.

158
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,000
I can see her.

159
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,800
Lucy?

160
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:44,880
You've got some nerve,
making old Rudy say things like that.

161
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:50,160
You know that Helzinger is not fat.

162
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:55,240
In fact, you said that Helzinger
was handsome.

163
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,640
Don't you shove me!

164
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,560
She slapped me.

165
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,360
Now I'll tell you something, Lucy.

166
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,600
You will leave Rudy alone,

167
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:14,200
and if you come back here again,
you'll have to deal with me.

168
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,040
Thank you, Lucy.

169
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,360
She really made you say all that?

170
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,040
Yeah.

171
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,760
Wasn't me.

172
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,920
Sorry.

173
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,200
Hey!

174
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,080
Lucy thinks I'm handsome?

175
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,120
Is that right, Lu...

176
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,720
What is he doing here?

177
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,560
Hello, Jimmy.

178
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,360
Go to hell, Ed.

179
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,480
Oh, you've already put me there.

180
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,560
Here.

181
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,080
But not for long, my friend.

182
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,240
I'll find my way out.

183
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,880
Because this place
is just one big puzzle,

184
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,360
and puzzles are my forte.

185
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,320
Nobody beats me.

186
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,520
I did.

187
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,360
See you never, Ed.

188
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,040
That's what you think.

189
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,600
I have the feeling he's going to be
more than a simple nuisance.

190
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,880
Not the type to be bribed,
nor distracted easily.

191
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,960
Indeed.

192
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,200
Very interesting.

193
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,160
What has no hands
but might knock on your door,

194
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,600
and you better open up if it does?

195
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,960
Mr. Gordon's continued interference
threatens to slow us down

196
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,000
when we're about to reach
our finest moment.

197
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,280
He'll do more than that.

198
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,040
Mr. Nygma.

199
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,960
Eavesdropping is rude and unwise.

200
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,120
Eavesdropping implies intent,
and I mostly accidentally overheard.

201
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,080
Overheard what?

202
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,120
Jim Gordon, the word nuisance.
Sounds familiar.

203
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,040
Probably has something to do
with your releasing Penguin

204
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,280
and Gordon's ex-fiancee.

205
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,240
Probably.

206
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,600
I can help you...

207
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,520
take him down.

208
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,800
I know everything about Jim Gordon.

209
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,040
If you let me out of here,
we could probably just sit down

210
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,520
- in your office...
- Mr. Nygma, you can't help me.

211
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,040
I'm here to help you.

212
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,880
Those are the roles
that were defined for the two of us.

213
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,440
Now, there's another pressing matter.

214
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,800
No. Listen. I, I...

215
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,560
I can manipulate people.

216
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,840
I did it to Gordon once,
and I can do it again,

217
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,000
because peoples' brains
are just a mystery,

218
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,600
and once you figure it out...

219
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,120
Look. Helzinger?

220
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,760
Can't stand criticism
because of an overbearing mother.

221
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,560
Wants love and approval.

222
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,640
Gets mad when he doesn't get it,
so I give it.

223
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,200
Oh, thank you!

224
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,960
Sharon.

225
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,320
Kleptomaniacal due
to obsessive-compulsive disorder.

226
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,240
Just give her something
to concentrate on.

227
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,680
And...

228
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,560
And Norton, serious boundary issues.

229
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,360
Prone to torture,
violence and cannibalism.

230
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,960
Unless he thinks he's your friend!

231
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,200
Oh. For me?

232
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,600
My point is, everyone has a story,
and they just wanna be listened to.

233
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,920
My God! I should be the shrink!

234
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,400
- What did you say?
- I'm sorry. Was that too far?

235
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,480
Everybody has a story.

236
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:15,240
That's it. Mr. Nygma,
you've actually been very helpful.

237
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,400
I have it, Peabody.

238
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,080
I have the cure
for our prize patient.

239
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,440
Do tell.

240
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,760
What is an identity?

241
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,960
What is a sense of self?

242
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,880
It is a story
that we humans tell ourselves.

243
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,680
We have got to give him
a great, heroic story.

244
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,240
We need to give him
a good heroic dose of Thorazine,

245
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,800
but you're the boss.

246
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,720
Perfect.

247
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,480
Perfect!

248
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,880
Sir?

249
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,720
Sir? Stop!

250
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,680
He's dangerous!

251
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,880
Hello?

252
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,600
Hello?

253
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,160
I need all available security
to the reanimation lab now!

254
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,800
No! Do not let them in!

255
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,760
<i>Do not interfere!</i>

256
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,960
My son. My son, please stop.

257
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,760
Why have you forsaken me?

258
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,680
Have you forgotten the code?

259
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,200
Who are you?

260
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,200
My poor, dear son.

261
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,480
Who do you think I am?

262
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,560
Your son?

263
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,080
You're my father?

264
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,120
Who else?

265
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,160
Don't you feel a father's love
when I look into your eyes?

266
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,880
Where am I?

267
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,440
What has happened to me?

268
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,040
What happened to me?

269
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,080
Why don't I know my name?

270
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,640
My son...

271
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,880
Calm your heart.

272
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,080
Demons took you to the land
of death and bewitched your soul,

273
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,880
but I brought you back to life.

274
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:31,080
You are the redeemed one.

275
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,360
What is my name?

276
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,360
You know your name.

277
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,720
No. No. There is another life.

278
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,760
There is a sister, a high tower.

279
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,360
No... no. Bewitchment.

280
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,360
False memories put into your head.

281
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,480
I am your father and your lord.

282
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,520
And he who has another birth,

283
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,960
brought forth
from the cold grasp of death

284
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,160
shall rise again and serve my Order.

285
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,640
I say this, and it becomes.

286
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,200
And I will give him the name of...

287
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,400
Azrael!

288
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,480
Yes!

289
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,880
I am Azrael!

290
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,800
My lord Dumas.

291
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,880
Command me.

292
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,160
This man ordered my parents' death?

293
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,760
You're sure?

294
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,200
I know he was part of the reason
they were killed.

295
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,080
Why is he not under arrest?

296
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,800
It's not so simple, hoss.

297
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,520
The evidence we have
is far too tenuous for a warrant.

298
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,080
It's ancient hearsay,
no fingerprints.

299
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,680
Only witness is dead.

300
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,760
Barnes wouldn't even say no.

301
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,440
He would just look at me
like I was nuts.

302
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,880
I'm sick of this.

303
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,720
We know where Strange is,

304
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,080
we know he's hurting people
right now,

305
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,920
and you two are talking
about politics with your boss

306
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,320
and then getting
a piece of paper signed.

307
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,200
- This is the way it works, Bruce.
- Why?

308
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,720
You're not a cop anymore.

309
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,600
Give us a sec?

310
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,800
Bruce, I know you're frustrated,
but we need to do this the right way.

311
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,880
The right way?

312
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,320
And how many times did that fail
with Galavan?

313
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,240
- It's not the same.
- He bent and broke the law

314
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,520
over and over again,

315
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,400
and Strange is doing the same thing.

316
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,080
This man killed Karen,
maybe my parents.

317
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:50,200
Look, I, I appreciate
everything that you've done for me.

318
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,360
But I fear we're going down
the same path as before,

319
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,760
- and we won't get justice unless...
- Unless what?

320
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,360
What you did to Galavan.

321
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,760
What you knew you had to do,

322
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,400
because of the bureaucracy
and the red tape.

323
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,720
What I had to do?

324
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,880
I chose to kill a man in cold blood,

325
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,600
and it was the wrong choice,
crossing that line.

326
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,280
You'll pay for it...

327
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,560
over and over again,
like I have been.

328
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,160
Like I still am.

329
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,720
And it will make you more
like the evil you're trying to fight.

330
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,160
You need to be better.

331
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,120
Do you understand me?

332
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,000
Just hold out a little bit longer.

333
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,760
We'll work on Barnes,
get him to sign off on a warrant

334
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,800
and put Strange away for good.

335
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,520
The right way.

336
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,920
<i>Fearing the knights had become soft
and weak from lack of leadership,</i>

337
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,200
<i>Lord Dumas split from among them
and formed a new faction.</i>

338
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:01,720
<i>He named this new sect after himself,
calling it The Order of St. Dumas.</i>

339
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,760
- Okay. Impressive.
- Yes.

340
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,480
His psyche couldn't reconcile
death and rebirth

341
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,320
until we gave it a grander context.

342
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,600
<i>...the epic corner of the land...</i>

343
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,760
A story.

344
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,800
He's Azrael now.

345
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,200
A fabled 12th-century knight

346
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,400
who died for the cause
of his feudal lord Adam Dumas.

347
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,400
This Dumas character
was made a saint,

348
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,160
performed a lot of miracles
and so forth.

349
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,800
And one of those miracles
was bringing Azrael back to life.

350
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,760
I still prefer Thorazine.

351
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,600
You need to learn to work
with what you have, Ms. Peabody.

352
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,520
- Okay.
- Our creations need new personas

353
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,000
to equal and embody
what they've become,

354
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,080
to give their minds focus.

355
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,600
Perhaps, this was Mr. Galavan's
destiny all along.

356
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,520
How do you even know
if the persona will hold?

357
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,840
There's only one way to find out.

358
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,440
We send our beautiful monster
out into the wild

359
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,880
with a simple task to perform.

360
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,840
He's going to need something to wear.

361
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,680
"Mr. Nygma, you have been,
you've actually been helpful.

362
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,560
Mr. Nygma,
you have actually been helpful."

363
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,800
Dismissal. The complete arrogance.

364
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,040
"Mr. Nygma. Mr. Nygma,
you have actually been helpful."

365
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,400
Inmate Helzinger.

366
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,480
Come with me.

367
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,240
Yes, ma'am.

368
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,400
Why do they keep disappearing
down that hallway?

369
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,640
Strange is hiding something.

370
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,840
Where are you taking me?

371
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,280
Where are we going?

372
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,720
Where are we going?

373
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,080
How interesting.

374
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,120
Move!

375
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,560
Hey, I know you.

376
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,280
I have a gift for you, my son.

377
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,160
I'm crafting your armor as we speak.

378
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,680
But first,
your skills must be tested.

379
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,440
I got it.

380
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,160
You're the mayor.

381
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,640
What is this place?

382
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,800
What's going...?

383
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,920
That is a demon.

384
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,080
What's going on in here?

385
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,200
- He lives in fire.
- I wanna get out of here!

386
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,200
That case will give you everything
you need to destroy him!

387
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,720
Let me get out of here!

388
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,720
Let me out of here! Let me out!

389
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,240
I wanna get out of here! I wanna...

390
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,560
Not exactly what I had in mind,
but good enough.

391
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,640
Try opening the chest, my son.

392
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,360
The Sword of Sin.

393
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:48,360
Your ally and instrument of justice,
a vanquisher of evil for generations.

394
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,560
She thirsts for blood.

395
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,240
Generations?

396
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,480
That sword was made yesterday.

397
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,880
It doesn't matter.

398
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,600
Our replica is central to his
acceptance of his new identity.

399
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,200
An awe-inspiring signature weapon.

400
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,280
What must I do?

401
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,240
A murderer walks the streets
of this city a free man.

402
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,640
For his sins, by your blade,
he must be destroyed.

403
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,000
Tell me his name.

404
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,680
James Gordon.

405
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,720
My lord, I am the Angel of Death.

406
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,080
James Gordon dies...

407
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,160
tonight.

408
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,600
My officers responded
to an anonymous tip

409
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,440
and arrived here
earlier this evening.

410
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,960
Upon entering the construction site,

411
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:47,920
my men discovered the bodies
of four male victims.

412
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,600
It'll be some time
before we have any information

413
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,120
about their identities.

414
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,920
That's all I have for you
at this time.

415
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,240
Excuse me.

416
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,760
No, that's it.

417
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,800
Hey, Cap, look who I found.

418
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,080
Shut it, Bullock.

419
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,080
- You have one hell of a nerve.
- Listen...

420
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,640
You think I don't know it was you
that busted out Karen Jennings?

421
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,920
- Tell me it wasn't you.
- Captain...

422
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,560
I don't wanna hear it.
How do I keep falling for your games?

423
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,920
Really, it's a mystery to me.

424
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,760
Every time you come back,
I truly believe that you've changed.

425
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,280
You're like an optical illusion.

426
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,040
Listen, I just need
five minutes of your time.

427
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,280
Hargrove! Snead!

428
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,680
Escort Mr. Gordon off my crime scene
immediately.

429
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,640
You, we're gonna have
a little discussion

430
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,800
about this tomorrow morning.

431
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,360
Captain Barnes, please. Hear him out.

432
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,560
Listen, kid...

433
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,520
Mr. Wayne, I don't care how much
money or pull you have in this town.

434
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,880
I'm through talking to him.

435
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,680
Are you through
listening to the truth?

436
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,840
Oh, come on. Give me a break.

437
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,880
All right, five minutes.

438
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,640
No, three minutes.

439
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,240
Okay. Bobby pins?

440
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,080
Only one?

441
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,640
- It's all I could steal.
- It'll have to do.

442
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,200
- Rudy, did you get the ammonia?
- Here.

443
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,880
Perfect.

444
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,960
Okay, now we just need
the bug zapper.

445
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,520
- What is this?
- It's a fly swatter.

446
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,200
I can see that it's a fly swatter.
I didn't ask for a fly swatter.

447
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,520
I asked for the bug zapper
in the kitchen.

448
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,680
What's the difference?

449
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,200
The difference is that one
has a black light

450
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,360
that emits ultraviolet energy

451
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,920
and this is leather on a stick.

452
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,200
They both kill flies.

453
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,920
I don't need to kill flies.

454
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,960
I need you to go back to the kitchen
and get the bug zapper.

455
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,440
What are you gonna do
with all this stuff, anyway?

456
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,160
I think Professor Strange
is hiding something.

457
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,920
And I think that something
is a secret way out of this dump.

458
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
So I'm gonna use this stuff
to find it.

459
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,040
So, in a nutshell,

460
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:57,800
Hugo Strange is making monsters
out of dead people in his spare time,

461
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,840
and he had Karen Jennings
killed by Victor Fries,

462
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,920
who's been dead for three months.

463
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,480
I know it sounds far-fetched.

464
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,880
Far-fetched? No. It sounds insane!

465
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,440
But it's true. Trust me.

466
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,760
How can I trust you
when you're talking crazy?

467
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,920
How can I trust you when you've lied
to me so many times? Monsters?

468
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,400
I lied to you because it's hard
to tell you the truth.

469
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,280
You're stubborn and you're angry,
and the GCPD has paid a price for it!

470
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,440
Really? You self-righteous punk.

471
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,000
You think you have all the answers?

472
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,360
Maybe you should run it yourself!

473
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,720
Maybe I will one day.

474
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,160
In your dreams.

475
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,560
Who's there?

476
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,240
I said, who's out there?

477
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,800
What the hell?

478
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,480
James Gordon.

479
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,080
The time for your penance has come.

480
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,240
You know this guy?

481
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,320
Who are you?

482
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:59,040
I am Azrael,
righteous scourge of sinners,

483
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,840
and I have come to kill you,
James Gordon.

484
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,520
Put down that weapon!

485
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,360
Put the weapon down!

486
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,440
Put it down right now, or I'll shoot!

487
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,960
Captain!

488
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,800
Jim!

489
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,720
I need information now.

490
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,280
What do we know about this guy?

491
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,240
Just what you saw.
Calls himself Azrael.

492
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,480
Wants to kill me.

493
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,160
We know Hugo Strange is responsible.

494
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,800
Told you so, did he?

495
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,080
Who else could it be?

496
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,800
I have no idea.

497
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,720
I have to find out the facts.

498
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,600
Fun part about being
a police detective,

499
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,320
instead of a loose cannon vigilante.

500
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,400
Excuse me, Captain.

501
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,880
I find your flippant attitude
to be inappropriate.

502
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,840
I find you to be kind
of a pain in the ass.

503
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,560
- What's he even doing here?
- I'm a concerned citizen.

504
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,600
I wanna know what you're doing
about all of this.

505
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,080
You...

506
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,360
Well, I'm gonna assemble
the Strike Force,

507
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,280
call in all off-duty personnel.

508
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,800
We're gonna dragnet the living
daylights out of this wacko.

509
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,320
A knight from outer space
shouldn't be too hard to find, right?

510
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,560
Okay?

511
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,520
That's what we're gonna do.

512
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,560
What you're gonna do is go home

513
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,920
and stop inserting yourself
into police business.

514
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,520
- Captain...
- That's the final word.

515
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,120
He's right. It's time you went home.

516
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,600
Leave the rest of this to the police,
and to me.

517
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,760
This is not just police business.
This is my business, too.

518
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:30,000
I can't make the moves I need to make
if I'm worrying about you.

519
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,080
You need to be at home,
where Alfred can look after you.

520
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,240
Hello, Grace.

521
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,960
How are you today?

522
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,800
<i>Incredibly, the attacker
fled the crime scene by,</i>

523
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,640
<i>for all intents and purposes,
scaling the side of the structure,</i>

524
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,480
<i>literally disappearing into thin air.</i>

525
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,960
<i>In all my years, Ken, I must say,</i>

526
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,120
<i>I've never seen anything
quite like it.</i>

527
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,800
<i>That a human being
should be capable of such feats.</i>

528
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,520
<i>It just astounds the mind.</i>

529
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,640
Theo Galavan,
the new mayor of Gotham!

530
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,560
Oh, brother, like I don't know you
from way back.

531
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,000
Remember.

532
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,880
He calls himself Azrael.

533
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,720
He's armed, dangerous,

534
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,000
and has exhibited some extraordinary
physical abilities.

535
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,040
But no one, and I mean no one,

536
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,160
comes into our city
and tries to carve up my officers.

537
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,920
We're gonna go out tonight,

538
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,720
and we're gonna comb
each and every block

539
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,240
until we find this masked freak

540
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,240
and put him behind bars
where he belongs.

541
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,440
- Any questions?
- No, sir!

542
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,880
Good. Now get out there and get him.

543
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,080
- What are you doing?
- I'm going out there.

544
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,400
- The hell you are.
- Excuse me?

545
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,320
You're staying here
for your own protection.

546
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,400
That's an order.

547
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,280
I'm not a cop anymore, remember?

548
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,040
I don't need to follow your orders.

549
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,800
You're absolutely right.

550
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,120
You two,
put Mr. Gordon here in lockup.

551
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,760
- What?
- I'm holding you

552
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,520
on suspicion of breaking
Karen Jennings out of GCPD custody.

553
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,520
- Don't do this!
- I've already done it.

554
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,680
So many stories to choose from.

555
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,360
I feel like a child
on Christmas morning.

556
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,360
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes.

557
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,480
I want to install personas
into more subjects immediately.

558
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,360
Everything we've worked for
is finally within reach.

559
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,320
"But I don't want to go among
mad people," Alice remarked.

560
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:12,400
"Oh, you can't help that,"
said the cat, "We're all mad here."

561
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,360
Oh, yes.

562
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,800
Yes, that will do nicely.

563
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,160
No news from the search.

564
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,840
Let me out of here.

565
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,440
This is for your own good.

566
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,080
Trust me, you've broken enough laws
for one day.

567
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,680
There are times when breaking the law
is the right thing to do.

568
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,600
And who gets to decide that, you?

569
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,520
Yeah. Someone has to.

570
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,320
No, Jim, you're wrong.

571
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,480
Look where Gotham's going.

572
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,560
Maniacs, perverts, freaks,
crawling out of every hole.

573
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,880
It's like a sea of evil
flooding the city.

574
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:03,040
If a man doesn't cling on to the law,
he'll lose his bearings, drown.

575
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,800
What gives with the lights?

576
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,560
- Everything's down.
- Come on, check the back.

577
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,320
- Blackout?
- I don't think so.

578
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,760
Where's a flashlight
when you need one?

579
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,000
Yeah, me neither.

580
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,000
James Gordon.

581
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,960
Back up against the cell!

582
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,360
Move!

583
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,920
This is Captain Barnes of the GCPD!

584
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:07,360
Whoever you are, step into the light
or we will take you out!

585
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,400
But I am the light,

586
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,440
tasked with vanquishing
the evil in that cell.

587
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,840
You can die trying!

588
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,680
You lead these men,
so I will parley with you.

589
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,200
Parley?

590
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:24,600
Order them to stand aside
and allow the sinner, James Gordon,

591
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,720
to be punished.

592
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,760
Do this, and I will spare them all.

593
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,240
Decline,
and they will face my judgment.

594
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,320
Their lives now rest in your hands.

595
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,360
How many will die?

596
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,040
All? Or one?

597
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,480
Decide, Captain.

598
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,840
You can go to hell.

599
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,600
I've been there.

600
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,960
You go.

601
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,080
Over there!

602
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,680
Do you see him?

603
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,560
Where did he go?

604
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,400
I don't know. You got eyes on him?

605
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,920
Get him out of there!

606
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,040
Such an amazing tool of destruction.

607
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,160
Vile sorcery.

608
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,600
We need a bigger gun.

609
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,720
Yeah.

610
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,960
I'm gonna lure the freak
up the stairs,

611
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,960
then you show up with something
that'll tear a hole in this bastard.

612
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,440
- You got it.
- Let's get to the roof right now!

613
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,080
You...

614
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,800
you will show me to him.

615
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,200
You will tell me where he is.

616
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,560
And then what?

617
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,120
You'll spare my life?

618
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,920
It's too late for that.

619
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,680
The most I can offer you
is a painless death.

620
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,520
Let's dance.

621
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,720
That, that is not possible.

622
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
You?

623
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,720
You're dead.

624
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,720
Not anymore.

625
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,400
Finally.

626
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,640
Come to me...

627
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,400
and I will show you the way to hell.

628
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,680
I know the way.

629
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,600
For those just joining us,
we're coming to you live

630
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,040
from outside of the Gotham
City Police Department...

631
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,960
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

632
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,840
<i>There been a major impact behind me.</i>

633
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,920
<i>The vehicle,
it appears a body has fallen...</i>

634
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,160
<i>- Theo Galavan.
- Theo Galavan.</i>

635
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,360
<i>- It's really him.
- It's him!</i>

636
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,640
<i>- Theo Galavan wearing...
- Oh, my God.</i>

637
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,560
<i>Galavan. He looks like he has...</i>

638
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:17,640
<i>Right. Once again, we are confirming
that the former mayor of Gotham City,</i>

639
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:21,840
<i>Theo Galavan, is alive
and dressed in a bizarre costume.</i>

640
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Boss.

641
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,120
Boss. Boss.

642
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,240
It's getting crazy in this town,
huh, Jim?

643
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,120
Don't talk. Just breathe.

644
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,080
I'm trying.

645
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,600
- You're gonna be okay.
- Sure, I am.

646
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,480
You're a pain in the ass,
you know that?

647
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,080
That makes two of us.

648
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,120
Boss, breathe! Come on, Captain.

649
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,920
Hold on. Stay with me.

650
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,400
Boss...

651
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,360
BP is falling fast. We gotta go now.

652
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,880
Radio Gotham General.
Let them know we're coming in hot!

653
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,800
Jim! Jim! What the hell happened?

654
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,120
- You okay?
- Yeah.

655
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,160
It was Galavan.

656
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,160
You sure?

657
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,880
I know it's hard to believe.

658
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,400
But Azrael is Galavan.

659
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,720
Barb.

660
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,480
That's a little irritating.

661
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,840
Sorry.

662
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,840
Hey.

663
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,320
Babes.

664
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,440
Relax.

665
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,200
Yeah.

666
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,880
No, I...

667
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,200
You guys have been so good to me.

668
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,200
That's okay. Don't worry.

669
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,200
Cocktails.

670
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,720
I make great cocktails.

671
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,920
Sure. That would be nice.

672
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,200
What do you want?

673
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,240
Bourbon on...

674
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,680
- Gimlets!
- Rocks.

675
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,760
- Actually, bourbon sounds...
- I'm making gimlets.

676
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,640
Okay, she scares me.

677
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,760
Don't be a baby. She's harmless.

678
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,360
Honey, I know you like her,

679
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,400
but that woman is mad
as a bag of squirrels.

680
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,600
She said she's cured.

681
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,400
That's what an insane person
would say.

682
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,600
Do we have any limes?

683
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,720
No.

684
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,840
- Oh, my God.
<i>- That's right, Don.</i>

685
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,880
<i>The masked assassin that attacked
the GCPD earlier tonight</i>

686
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,400
<i>has been identified
as former mayor Theo Galavan.</i>

687
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,280
<i>- Now, there were reports earlier...</i>
- Theo? It can't be.

688
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,160
Holy moly.

689
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:46,280
<i>The assassin was forced off the roof,
then fell right over there,</i>

690
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,840
<i>then stood up in front of all of us.</i>

691
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:52,160
<i>And it was him, Theo Galavan, alive.</i>

692
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,720
<i>And from what we know,</i>

693
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,840
<i>he's responsible
for three officer fatalities.</i>

694
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,120
<i>We also learned that...</i>

695
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,880
Hello, old friend.

696
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:08,520
<i>...still at large and is considered
extremely dangerous.</i>

697
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:12,520
Well, he must never have been dead.

698
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,800
I mean, that's the only possibility.

699
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,880
I mean, no one dies and comes back
to life again, do they?

700
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,720
No one.

701
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,440
But he did.

702
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,200
Strange.

703
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,800
Strange must be behind this.

704
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,240
What the hell
is happening to our city?

705
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,280
Nothing good.

706
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,400
No, no, I don't wanna go.

707
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,720
We're just going to see...

708
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,120
Oh, my.
