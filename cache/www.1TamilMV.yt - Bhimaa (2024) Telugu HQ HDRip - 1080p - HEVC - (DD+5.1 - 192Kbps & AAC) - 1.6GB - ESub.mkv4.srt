1
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:50,375
Lord of this Universe. Sri Mahavishnu's
6th incarnation is Parasurama .

2
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:58,833
Parasurama circled earth 21 times in Treta Yug and
the land he won after finishing all the evil...

3
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:01,958
He donated that land to
Kashyapa Prajapathi.

4
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:08,625
Later, the holy serpents and Gods
requested for a land for them also to live.

5
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:16,583
Parasurama threw his axe presented
by Lord Shiva, into the ocean.

6
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:22,833
He then made the ocean pull backwards
and made a wonderful land evolve there.

7
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:26,708
Minerals from the ocean further
enhanced the fertility of that land.

8
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:34,458
Rare medicinal plants not available
anywhere else, evolved in this forest.

9
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:41,375
Parasurama, one of the seven holy persons to live
eternally, opted that land as his place for penance.

10
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:44,958
That land is Parasurama Kshetra.

11
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:49,708
Another wonder seen by this land, is
the evolution of most powerful temple of

12
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:52,750
Lord Shiva, who is worshipped
by Parasurama.

13
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:33,000
-Were you scared?
-Yes!

14
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,416
Grandpa, do spirits exist?

15
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:39,041
-Do you believe in God?
-Yes!

16
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:43,833
Then, you must believe
even in devil.

17
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:47,791
Then why did the ghost come to
a temple where God resides?

18
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,458
That is a wonder. Wonder can’t
be understood by thinking.

19
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:56,791
You know it, only by experiencing it.

20
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,583
Then why is such a wonderful
temple closed down?

21
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:04,166
This temple has a great history.

22
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:11,250
In the forest 3 yojanas(36-45 KM)
away from the roaring sea shore…

23
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:16,625
Power incarnation of Lord Shiva
has evolved to safeguard us.

24
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:21,833
Goddess Ganga herself showers her
waters continuously on Lord Shiva,

25
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:24,500
who loves to be decorated.

26
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:29,750
These walls once resounded with
the prayers, sound of Conch

27
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:32,291
and praises to the Lord.

28
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:41,083
When someone dies suddenly at
an early age, their soul still stays

29
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:46,458
in this world until their
10th day ritual is completed.

30
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:50,291
They can fulfil their last wish
by then.

31
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:55,375
But, that wish must be righteous.

32
00:04:55,875 --> 00:05:01,708
Fulfilling that should be written
in their fate.

33
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:07,916
When someone from the family
wholeheartedly worships before

34
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:14,500
the final ritual of the dead, spirit
of the dead possesses over them.

35
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:17,833
It then fulfils its final wish.

36
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:25,833
A son five decades ago to fulfil
his dead father’s final wish,

37
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:28,875
requested that Lord Shiva.

38
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:35,000
Then his father’s spirit
possessed over him.

39
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:42,125
And killed the maternal uncle,
who poisoned him.

40
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:45,541
People who saw that had
a shiver in their backs.

41
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:51,333
Those officials how went to investigate
heinous act found it beyond their imagination.

42
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:56,125
Head priest argued that the person
who did the murder was not

43
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,375
this son but spirit of father.

44
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:02,791
As the strong trust from ages
can’t be ruled out…

45
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:08,000
Officials decided to close down
the temple until the case is solved.

46
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:14,875
Though offerings and worships are
not carried out from then till now…

47
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:21,458
Worship continues by flow water to Lord Shiva
hasn’t stopped in this holy place..

48
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:25,083
Trust of the devotees hasn’t
come down.

49
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,291
It’s been so long since we came.
Why did he bring us by force?

50
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:03,250
One should come home or take people
to Police station to do an enquiry.

51
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:06,500
What does he think of us?
Who the hell is he?

52
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:10,083
You can be enquired right in
the Police station.

53
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:14,791
But there is no guarantee that
you’d return home safe.

54
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,958
Sir, what did we do?
We are into petrol business legally.

55
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,583
Two tankers are loading
every time in the company.

56
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:27,291
Those two tankers are being
unloaded in your bunks.

57
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:33,083
But, how is a third tanker passing through
the check post with the same permit?

58
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,166
We are in no way linked to
that third tanker.

59
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:48,000
But if I tell about the person behind that,
I can never see my daughter again Sir.

60
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:52,625
Give me a written complaint. I’ll give
you a guarantee that you return home.

61
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,583
Come out!

62
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,291
-Bhavani!
-Sir!

63
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:40,750
-Brother, we did a mistake.
-Please forgive us, sir.

64
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:46,666
I’d have let this go if my smuggling,
business or something else was touched.

65
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:50,625
But those that tanker is my life.

66
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:58,875
I’ll not leave anyone who messes
with those.

67
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:21,333
When someone messes with my
father, only his son should kill them.

68
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:29,791
One must know about this Rudra behind
him, before messing up with Bhavani.

69
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,750
-Madam, one tea!
-Please sit, I’ll give.

70
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,708
I need one hour to go to
parlour, boss.

71
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,166
-Massage parlour?
-Boss!

72
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,208
Dear, can you please sit there?

73
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,500
Why does she look so cheap
at us?

74
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,333
-Will she give us tea?
-Let’s have coffee then.

75
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,041
-Oh no!
-No use!

76
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:52,791
Brother, what’s this?
Come, let’s leave.

77
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,375
She maybe cleaning since
we are coming.

78
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:57,333
Be positive, especially when
you are negative.

79
00:09:58,625 --> 00:09:59,500
I see!

80
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,750
No…

81
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:08,083
-Shameless life!
-Aunty, one tea!

82
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:10,291
-No milk, dear!
-What?

83
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:12,458
Didn’t the milk vendor come or
didn’t the buffalo give milk?

84
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,791
You haven’t paid your debt,
dirty rascal.

85
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,500
You think this is your in law’s house
to come and have tea, biscuits and all

86
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:22,041
without paying for so long, dirty idiot?

87
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,208
-Did I ever say like that, dear?
-You just said it, idiot.

88
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,375
-There is really no milk.
-Oh!

89
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,875
Sir, tea with full milk!
Please have it.

90
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,166
Why did she give to that old man?

91
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:36,083
-Here is hot samosa, have it.
-Thank you!

92
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:39,875
-Missing boy!
-That’s two months back paper, boss.

93
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:42,541
Your name shouldn’t have been
Swarna Kamalam, but crazy flower.

94
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,750
-Call that number.
-Ok!

95
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,500
-Hello!
-Did your son go missing?

96
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:51,791
-Yes madam, but we got him back.
-Damn, dirty rascal!

97
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,541
Boss, it seems they found the kid.

98
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:58,166
-Oh yeah! Get the amount ready,
I‘ll visit the city. -What?

99
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:09,416
-Hi, I’m one and only Satish.
-My name is also Satish.

100
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,166
But, he doesn’t have a son like this.

101
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:15,000
If not, you should be visiting some
sexologist. Why did you come to me?

102
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,333
We are the sincere citizen
searching for your son.

103
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:21,291
Oh thank you, but we found him
within a week after he went missing.

104
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,541
-Then, why didn’t you tell?
-For what?

105
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,625
You published it in paper when he went
missing and you should do the same

106
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,166
after finding him, right?
That is the basic ethics.

107
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:28,708
-What?
-What!

108
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:32,875
We are waking up early by 5 daily
and are searching for your son.

109
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,083
-Did you ask me and search?
-Oh, I see!

110
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:38,500
Many others are searching similar
to us. Shall I bring them all?

111
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,791
Oh, what should I do now?

112
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:43,500
-You know how much time and
money did our Boss invest? -Yes!

113
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:47,291
Forget time, it is not back once spent.
But, money comes back, right?

114
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,375
-Yes!
-It comes, right?

115
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:52,583
-Oh no!
-Don’t you need it?

116
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:56,250
No, cross the door front and give it sir.
Money makes many! -Oh my!

117
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,458
Please adjust with this
fifty thousand.

118
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:01,208
-Take it, that’s mine.
-Ok!

119
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:04,375
-I’ll publish it in paper tomorrow that
I found my son. -Ok!

120
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,958
Matter has reached very fast.

121
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,125
How do you get such ideas, Boss?

122
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,583
-From the bottom…
-Boss!

123
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,708
When there’s fire in the botton,
ideas come automatically.

124
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:18,625
SLN bus coming to Anantapur
from Mangalur met with

125
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:21,166
a dreaded accident at
Anantapur ghat road.

126
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:25,458
All the passengers in the bus died on
the spot along with the driver and cleaner.

127
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:28,458
Family members are weeping
at the unidentifiable dead bodies

128
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:31,875
of their relative's kin at Anantapur
Victoria memorial hospital.

129
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:35,083
Bus owner Muniappa is kind enough
and is distributing a compensation of

130
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,750
ten lakhs to the family members
of the deceased.

131
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,833
-Not here, do that there.
-Where?

132
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,583
-Search!
-What to search, brother?

133
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:52,916
Search for an orphan body.

134
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,541
-Why orphan body, Boss?
-For you to beg. -What?

135
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:03,833
Number 14 and 15 are both orphan bodies.

136
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,458
Ok, number 14!
Wait!

137
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,083
Relative of this body has been
for a tea or a smoke.

138
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,416
These idiots would even leave
the bodies, but not their bad habits.

139
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,500
-Give some time.
-Ok, brother!

140
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:19,375
-Your person?
-No -Go!

141
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:23,083
-He is your husband, cry.
-Oh no, husband! -Stop!

142
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:26,708
-Not like that, adjust the makeup!
-Husband!

143
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:32,625
-What did you do, husband?
-Oh no!

144
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,791
Did you lend him money?
Why are you weeping so much?

145
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,833
You continue.

146
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:40,375
We are in shock that
my brother died.

147
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:44,541
I too am on scotch. I had a quarter as
I was unable to bear this bad smell.

148
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,375
Do you have any doubt on me?
-No. -I have a doubt on you.

149
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,958
I mean, it is written ‘FRAUD’
on that T-shirt.

150
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,791
-This is ‘Ford’, idiot.
-It maybe ‘FORD’ or whatever.

151
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,083
If he is your brother, can you say
where is the mole on his waist?

152
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:03,500
Is my brother Anushka to show waist
by wearing a sari? He wore a lungi.

153
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:08,333
In such a case, how do I say he
is your relative when you don’t

154
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:10,458
say where are the moles?

155
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:13,083
It is not justified for you to talk
about moles when we are in

156
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:14,500
vain of my brother’s death.

157
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:17,625
-Hey!
-Jackson, give money for his drink.

158
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:23,583
Oh no! Sir, my sister in law
is down, please write fast.

159
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:26,125
Yes, I’ll write now and she’ll get up.
See, she’ll get up.

160
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,666
Yes, she is up.
You leave now.

161
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:32,750
Please take this ten lakhs
cheque, madam.

162
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,041
You can’t buy my brother’s life
with this dirty money, sir.

163
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,041
So, you don’t want this?

164
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,833
I don’t want, but my sister in law
needs it.

165
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:40,833
She’ll buy a sewing machine
and take care of us all.

166
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:43,333
-Leave me, no.
-My sister in law, sir.

167
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,333
-What?
-Promise! We’ll take leave, sir.

168
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,791
-Hey! -What?
-Who’ll take the body?

169
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:52,875
-Start it!
Oh no, husband!

170
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:57,583
-Hey, I need…
-Ten Lakhs, yay!

171
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,083
-Wow! -Pour, brother!
-Rascal!

172
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:05,125
Boss, kebab…

173
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:17,166
Brother, there’s some bonding
in between us.

174
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,083
Otherwise, why would you get
ten lakhs to this small batch?

175
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,666
I will do anytthing for you,
come what may.

176
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,541
But, I don’t know who you are.

177
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:34,666
I’m having drinks in a pain that I’m
unable to do anything for you.

178
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:39,708
I’d have done if I could.
I really would’ve done.

179
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:42,541
Mother promise, I’d have done.

180
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:50,708
Jackson, hey!

181
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:54,583
Will there be tigers here?

182
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:59,375
-Hey, who is it rascal?
-Hey Boss, shut up.

183
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:19,916
Hey Lord, a girl approaches
mother when she is angry.

184
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,458
She approaches her father
when she is in a trouble.

185
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,750
My husband is a loyal Police officer.

186
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:30,041
They say he died in an accident.

187
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:36,083
They said even his body is
not found.

188
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:42,708
Whenever I remember my husband’s
smile, my tears aren’t stopping.

189
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:47,250
You’ve taken away my only
companion.

190
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:52,416
Either you take an incarnation
or send your power,

191
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,458
you got to do justice to your child.

192
00:16:56,625 --> 00:17:01,708
If your existence is true, you come
in some form to save the virtue.

193
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:08,333
One who comes, will come
for sure.

194
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:14,541
But the one coming even by
mocking the death…

195
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:21,125
The person cleansing the evil
and winning hearts…

196
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:28,416
He will come riding a bull like that
Lord Shiva descending from Kailasa.

197
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,875
He will definitely come.

198
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:01,666
Who is that guy coming like
Lord Shiva riding a bull?

199
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,500
He doesn’t look to me like Shiva.

200
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,125
I think a drama artist has come
wearing a khaki shirt.

201
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,416
Hey Shikari, give him some money
and send him away.

202
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:11,875
Here!

203
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,708
-Hail to Lord Shiva!
-Oh no!

204
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,041
Oh no!

205
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:29,916
This is the VIP darshan.
Did you see Lord Shiva, idiot?

206
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:31,958
Yes, my Lord!

207
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:41,083
Hey, will he be a God just by hitting
one fellow? Go guys, beat him up.

208
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:47,458
Oh no! No, I said you not to
hit me, right?

209
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:50,375
Not here.
Look there, rascal.

210
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,583
Not the God, but Police!

211
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,208
Correct answer!

212
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:57,416
A Police?

213
00:18:57,625 --> 00:19:00,666
A gift voucher for you
from Kalamandir!

214
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,375
I’m not giving that.
But, I’m giving you an offer.

215
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:07,416
-An offer?
-An offer to hit the Police.

216
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:11,125
-I’ll hit!
-I’ll hit!

217
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:14,958
Hey guys, what’s that excitement
like stray pigs? There are rules.

218
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:16,625
-Rules?
-Yes!

219
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:20,666
-You can punch me as many times
the count of letters in your name. -Ok!

220
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,083
But if you miss…

221
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:26,333
I get the chance to punch you
for just once.

222
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,166
No case, no lockup!

223
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:33,083
Disappointment if you delay,
guy losing the chance is a fool.

224
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:37,083
He is Malli. Just two letters
and two punches.

225
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:41,708
Mandapeta Malli! There’s no goon
without his area name as prefix.

226
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:43,625
It is six letters, right?

227
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,250
Do you know it all, sir?

228
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,333
You shut up and you go on.

229
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:49,125
See, I will never miss.

230
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,750
Oh no, I will never miss.

231
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:09,208
Is this a hand or a 1000 Volt
transformer, sir?

232
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,708
Estimate the voltage based on
the damage.

233
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:16,875
He is Sri. He has no area name too.
Just one letter and one punch.

234
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:20,833
Srinivasa Ramanuja Parabrahma
Yadav, as per the ration card!

235
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,666
Lucky guy, he gets 15 punches.
Come!

236
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:33,291
-Oh no!
-Yuck! He’s there, rascal.

237
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,541
Wow! Underground water would’ve
pumped up if you pressed a bit more, sir.

238
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,750
My dear devotee, water pumped up
from his underground and that’s enough.

239
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:52,166
Bonitas!
Hey, that is not a cuss word.

240
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:55,000
Bonita in Spanish means
beautiful woman.

241
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:56,375
Oh, thank you!

242
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,041
-Tea please!
-Sugar…

243
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,833
Sugar exists right in the smile.
Why more?

244
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,083
Come on, dear.

245
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:03,666
-Sir!
-Yes!

246
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:05,958
You have great following in ladies.

247
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:09,375
No more names now and it is
the game directly. Hey…

248
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:54,750
Sir!

249
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:58,250
Where is that Bhavani idiot, who
feels like a macho in this village?

250
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,666
His boss is here, won’t he come
and meet?

251
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:06,125
-What’s that expression? Did I beat
him up already? -Yes!

252
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:11,250
-Beware in hide and seek,
where is the fool? -Here!

253
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:19,791
-Is he Bhavani?
-I swear. Mother promise!

254
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:21,750
Hey my devotee, is it you?

255
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:24,875
I expected you to be wild,
dominating in the forest.

256
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:27,541
But you look like a seedless raisin.
Tell me the truth.

257
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:30,875
-Are you Bhavani?
-Yes! -Yuck!

258
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:37,625
What’s this?
Should I smash you?

259
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,083
Your heart would slip into your
shorts if I just sneeze aloud.

260
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:43,791
-What do you know about my
problem, Sattipandu? -I’m Bhavani.

261
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,166
Sattipandu, why are you in a hurry
without listening to me completely?

262
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:51,875
Look Sattipandu, I am being transferred
from every place I’m posted

263
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:53,916
by finishing the game just with in
half or one day.

264
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:58,416
Thus when I requested the Commissioner,
he sent me here by giving a great hope

265
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:00,500
that you are a monster and
this case will take time.

266
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:02,916
But when I came down here,
game is over just within an hour.

267
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:07,166
If Commissioner gets to know about
this, he’ll immediately transfer me.

268
00:24:07,916 --> 00:24:09,208
I haven’t even opened
the zip yet.

269
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:13,083
I mean, my bag zip.
You misunderstood, right? Naughty!

270
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:20,333
-Oh no! Sattipandu, give some idea
for me to stay back here. -Idea?

271
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:23,083
-Idea, idea….
-Tea!

272
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,791
-Yes, I got it.
-What?

273
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:28,666
-An idea! What if you get
a heart attack now? -Oh no…

274
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:33,083
-What if that comes after
one month? -Thank God!

275
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:37,291
-Cheers!
-Thank you.

276
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,916
See, impact comes down a bit
when you keep pain in buffering.

277
00:24:41,625 --> 00:24:43,833
Sattipandu, I’ll give you an offer.

278
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,916
I won’t arrest you now. I’ll be in this
village for one month on vacation.

279
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:52,375
You watch daily soaps, go for
shopping, attend marriages or

280
00:24:52,541 --> 00:24:55,583
functions with your family, or get
into telling fairy tales with

281
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:59,291
your grandchildren for this
one month.

282
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:02,250
But, a small change!

283
00:25:02,666 --> 00:25:05,166
The Prince will not come
riding a horse now.

284
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:08,375
Say, he will come riding a bull.

285
00:25:09,125 --> 00:25:11,541
If you disturb me while I’m on
vacation,

286
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:12,875
I’ll hit you irrespective of
the occasion you are at.

287
00:25:13,083 --> 00:25:14,250
-Hey!
-Just shut up!

288
00:25:15,166 --> 00:25:17,375
You must come voluntarily and
get into the lockup in one month.

289
00:25:18,041 --> 00:25:19,500
You will come and rest.

290
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:21,375
-Bonita!
-Yes!

291
00:25:21,583 --> 00:25:23,000
Thank you for your hospitality.

292
00:25:27,708 --> 00:25:29,708
-Oh no!
-Aah!

293
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:38,000
Sir, why did you come here
instead of coming to the station?

294
00:25:38,166 --> 00:25:39,083
Why did you come?

295
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,000
-I came to garland you.
-Then, go on!

296
00:25:41,208 --> 00:25:42,416
We don’t get it, sir.

297
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:43,708
-Why are you here?
-To play the band.

298
00:25:43,916 --> 00:25:44,666
Go on then.

299
00:25:46,041 --> 00:25:48,625
-Don’t we have cheer girls?
-Cheer girls? -Yes!

300
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:52,125
Sir, your expectations are high
and our budget is low.

301
00:25:52,458 --> 00:25:54,083
Adjust with Chintamani for now.

302
00:25:54,291 --> 00:25:55,500
-Which Mani?
-The Mani behind!

303
00:25:55,666 --> 00:25:57,333
Oh, you are that Mani?
Come, Mani!

304
00:26:01,583 --> 00:26:03,208
Why did you stop?
Continue!

305
00:26:04,625 --> 00:26:05,750
-Sir!
-Yes!

306
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,833
You beat us up after asking all our
names. Don’t you say your name?

307
00:26:09,041 --> 00:26:12,625
I wrote a song myself about me,
to suit such situations.

308
00:26:12,791 --> 00:26:15,250
As per the request of audience,
my title song!

309
00:26:15,583 --> 00:26:17,833
All the rights are reserved by me.

310
00:26:48,041 --> 00:26:51,375
“Play the band in the narrow
streets, dude”

311
00:26:51,666 --> 00:26:55,375
“Boss, here comes
Mr cool, Bhimaa”

312
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:06,916
“Which type or you,
mass or temper?”

313
00:27:07,166 --> 00:27:10,833
“This Bhimaa is the mix of
vigour and temper”

314
00:27:18,916 --> 00:27:22,708
“Be silent, he’s the branding
for violence”

315
00:27:22,916 --> 00:27:26,208
“He’s the burning rampage and
you’re finished if you trouble”

316
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:30,583
“Don't ask for his background,
he is in the fore ground”

317
00:27:30,791 --> 00:27:34,041
“Bhimaa arrived here
by confusing that Lord Brahma”

318
00:27:58,125 --> 00:27:59,916
Not a quarter, drink water.

319
00:28:20,791 --> 00:28:24,375
“He’s the monster and
a fully loaded gun version”

320
00:28:24,583 --> 00:28:27,958
“He’s the ferocious demon
being silent”

321
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:32,291
“He’ll pick and end all
the bad people”

322
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:36,208
“He is so super as a friend”

323
00:28:36,416 --> 00:28:39,791
“Whatever is the danger,
he faces it from front”

324
00:28:40,041 --> 00:28:43,500
“He’s with great mercy like
the God”

325
00:28:43,958 --> 00:28:47,541
“Though so many states and
regions oppose”

326
00:28:47,708 --> 00:28:51,250
“This stubborn man doesn’t
listen even when said no”

327
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:55,375
“Play the band in the narrow
streets, dude”

328
00:28:55,583 --> 00:28:59,208
“Boss, here comes
Mr cool, Bhimaa”

329
00:28:59,583 --> 00:29:03,083
“Which type or you,
mass or temper?”

330
00:29:03,291 --> 00:29:06,833
“This Bhimaa is the mix of
vigour and temper”

331
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:10,958
“Be silent, he’s the branding
for violence”

332
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:14,875
“He’s the burning rampage and
you’re finished if you trouble”

333
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:18,916
“Don't ask for his background,
he is in the fore ground”

334
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:22,416
“Bhimaa arrived here
by confusing that Lord Brahma”

335
00:29:30,625 --> 00:29:31,916
Sir...

336
00:29:32,666 --> 00:29:33,750
Sir, what are you doing?

337
00:29:33,958 --> 00:29:36,125
It is an illegal bunk, shut it.

338
00:29:36,291 --> 00:29:37,583
Sir, are you a Police or a Rowdy?

339
00:29:37,791 --> 00:29:40,125
No doubt, a Rowdy Police!

340
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,583
Daddy! It seems, some new SI idiot
came home and overacted.

341
00:29:49,916 --> 00:29:54,875
I’ll break that rascal’s back and
make him salute you every day.

342
00:29:55,416 --> 00:29:57,083
No!

343
00:29:57,416 --> 00:30:01,000
You know how important is
that job you left for, right?

344
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,541
You first finish that and
then come home.

345
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:09,083
My revenge will burn fiercely
and turn into a rage by then.

346
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:13,416
Let’s burn him in that fire
once you are back.

347
00:30:16,708 --> 00:30:19,250
You can use your influence and
get that Bhimaa transferred

348
00:30:19,416 --> 00:30:21,458
in just one minute, right?

349
00:30:22,416 --> 00:30:26,708
He himself said, he got used
to transfers.

350
00:30:27,833 --> 00:30:31,916
What pain will he feel if I too
do the same?

351
00:30:32,625 --> 00:30:38,500
Once my Rudra is back, I too will
insult him in front of everyone in

352
00:30:38,791 --> 00:30:45,541
this village like he did to me and make
him fall on my feet asking me to forgive.

353
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:49,583
Let him overact till then.

354
00:31:30,625 --> 00:31:31,708
Mike testing 1, 2, 3…

355
00:31:32,041 --> 00:31:34,208
Will he start a singing
program now?

356
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,750
My dear brothers and sisters!

357
00:31:35,958 --> 00:31:38,416
I think none would listen if you
say sisters, being so handsome sir.

358
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:40,041
Correct man, ok wait!

359
00:31:40,625 --> 00:31:41,833
Old man sitting at the corner!

360
00:31:42,708 --> 00:31:45,000
Quarter Pandu soon transforming
into a photo over the wall!

361
00:31:46,291 --> 00:31:49,208
Beautiful Kanta and Kantarao
eying on her!

362
00:31:49,958 --> 00:31:52,750
Please listen to me.
My name is Bhimaa.

363
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,458
Bhimaa?
Where is your mace?

364
00:31:54,666 --> 00:31:56,750
Another idiot asked just like you and
I shoved it into his shorts.

365
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:58,625
-Say if you need it and I’ll bring it.
-Thanks!

366
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:01,833
-I’m giving an offer to you all.
-Oh no, offer?

367
00:32:03,458 --> 00:32:05,750
If any of your items are stolen
from now on, come and give

368
00:32:05,958 --> 00:32:07,166
a complaint in the Police station.

369
00:32:07,375 --> 00:32:08,958
We’ll lose money again, if
we come to the Police station.

370
00:32:09,125 --> 00:32:11,541
We will not believe in Police.

371
00:32:16,333 --> 00:32:17,916
Fine, you don’t believe and
continue licking the lemon.

372
00:32:18,666 --> 00:32:22,333
All the rest, come to Police station and
take the value of your stolen items in cash.

373
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:23,083
What?

374
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:25,625
-Will you pay in cash if we lose
any item? -Yes!

375
00:32:26,208 --> 00:32:29,791
What? We pull money from the
customers who give us the complaint.

376
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:31,791
-Why does he say to pay in return?
-Yes!

377
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,208
Will you give money if anything is
lost, sir?

378
00:32:33,416 --> 00:32:34,958
I can’t give back if your wife
has eloped, man.

379
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:37,208
-I, myself will not give a complaint
if she is gone. -This is correct.

380
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:38,750
Won’t I push you in lockup if
you give a complaint?

381
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:44,000
If any idiot gives a false complaint,
I’ll park a rusted rod in his cellar.

382
00:32:44,916 --> 00:32:48,208
This offer will be on from today
until I’m here in your village.

383
00:32:48,416 --> 00:32:50,916
Don’t be disappointed by delaying
and the guy losing this will be a fool.

384
00:32:57,583 --> 00:32:58,375
Sir!

385
00:32:59,625 --> 00:33:01,916
When we come here and give
a complaint saying something

386
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:05,833
is stolen, you pay money
it seems, sir?

387
00:33:06,583 --> 00:33:07,458
-Mr Rao!
-Sir!

388
00:33:07,666 --> 00:33:10,083
-Customer is here, come on.
-Why is he talking like us?

389
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,125
Please tell me, sir.

390
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:17,083
My purse is stolen in 12B bus
at Geetha Nagar road, sir.

391
00:33:17,583 --> 00:33:19,333
-Pick pocket?
-Yes sir!

392
00:33:19,541 --> 00:33:21,333
No mercy at all, to these
dirty thieves. Damn!

393
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,666
-It is for you.
-I understood!

394
00:33:23,916 --> 00:33:25,333
-Mr old boy!
-Sir!

395
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,375
-How much was there in the purse?
-Ten thousand, sir.

396
00:33:27,791 --> 00:33:29,291
-Just ten thousand?
-Yes sir!

397
00:33:31,291 --> 00:33:32,458
-Mr Rao!
-Sir!

398
00:33:32,833 --> 00:33:35,458
-Write ten thousand five hundred.
-Why?

399
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:38,541
-We got to buy a new purse for
old boy, right? -Thank you, sir.

400
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,375
-Please write, sir.
-I’m writing, sir.

401
00:33:41,666 --> 00:33:42,750
Write a new purse also, sir.

402
00:33:42,958 --> 00:33:44,083
-I’m writing that too, sir.
-Ok, sir.

403
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,666
-Sir!
-Yes!

404
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:47,916
Oh no, I forgot.

405
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:49,000
-Manju!
-Oh no!

406
00:33:49,666 --> 00:33:51,708
Everyone is waiting for your entry.

407
00:33:58,875 --> 00:34:01,375
I’ll beat you up if you come in
slow motion as I said entry.

408
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:04,125
Say Boss!

409
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,083
Do the settlement to this old boy
with your golden hand.

410
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,208
Look old boy, you don’t worry
at all. Here, take this.

411
00:34:11,708 --> 00:34:12,791
This is the profit.

412
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,500
-Rao sir, call all your people and ask
them to give an autograph. -Why?

413
00:34:19,833 --> 00:34:22,041
Why? Boss, tell him once.

414
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:23,875
As a witness that settlement
is done, Mr Rao.

415
00:34:24,083 --> 00:34:26,041
Oh, fine! Then, we will sign.

416
00:34:26,833 --> 00:34:32,625
Mr Rao! Thanks for signing voluntarily
to pay 15,500 next week with interest

417
00:34:32,833 --> 00:34:39,583
for the 10,500 you’ve taken
from me.

418
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,916
-Sir, why should we pay this?
-What is this, sir?

419
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:44,916
Will you pay if a mechanic
doesn’t repair?

420
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,833
Will you pay if a Doctor
doesn’t treat?

421
00:34:49,833 --> 00:34:53,500
Then why should a Police not
doing his job, get his salary paid?

422
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,291
Don’t you have any shame?
Of course, you’d have let that gone.

423
00:34:59,666 --> 00:35:02,000
You treat people coming to
give a complaint as customers?

424
00:35:02,666 --> 00:35:05,916
We don’t need to favour them,
but we should do our job well.

425
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:08,041
It is after all a pick pocket
case, sir.

426
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:11,458
Pick pocket! Pick pocket!

427
00:35:12,166 --> 00:35:15,708
When a middleclass person works
hard for the entire month and

428
00:35:15,916 --> 00:35:19,041
takes his salary and if that is
lost in pickpocketing…

429
00:35:19,583 --> 00:35:22,333
When he stands with empty pocket
unable to pay his milk bill,

430
00:35:22,541 --> 00:35:25,916
current bill, medical bill and
water bill…

431
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,208
You know how that feels?

432
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:31,916
When he’s unable to pay the debt
taken and the lender is insulting

433
00:35:32,125 --> 00:35:35,750
the ladies in his family,
his head is down in shame.

434
00:35:37,583 --> 00:35:39,083
You know how it feels?

435
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:42,000
You say that is after all.

436
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:45,333
It is not a big case when the rich
or a bank gets looted and

437
00:35:45,541 --> 00:35:47,458
petty case when the poor is robbed.

438
00:35:48,541 --> 00:35:51,125
We shouldn’t provide them service
based on the crime size, Mr Rao.

439
00:35:52,375 --> 00:35:54,708
Public service is a serious duty.

440
00:35:55,708 --> 00:35:58,666
That too, police service is
a damn serious responsibility.

441
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:04,125
Middleclass man is half dead
right when he gets robbed.

442
00:36:05,208 --> 00:36:09,833
Taking a bribe from such a guy is
like collecting coins over a corpse.

443
00:36:10,666 --> 00:36:13,458
You get salaries only if you have
an interest in finding the lost items

444
00:36:13,666 --> 00:36:15,708
and the guy stealing those.

445
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:22,083
Or else, I’ll make you pay
that value along with interest.

446
00:36:24,458 --> 00:36:26,416
-Did you understand?
-Yes, we understood sir.

447
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:29,458
Rao Sir, robbery in B12 route
means it is by that Ranga idiot.

448
00:36:29,666 --> 00:36:31,875
-I’ll go and bring him urgently. Hold this
old man here till then. -Ok!

449
00:36:32,083 --> 00:36:33,208
Sir, please be right here and
I’m back soon.

450
00:36:33,416 --> 00:36:35,166
Sir, you too be right here.
Please don’t go, sir.

451
00:36:37,875 --> 00:36:38,625
Ranga!

452
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,541
-Ranga!
-Sir!

453
00:36:41,541 --> 00:36:44,000
-Oh, are you here? -I said, will send
the commission in the evening, right?

454
00:36:44,208 --> 00:36:49,166
Not the commission, rascal!
Our new SI has given us a mission impossible.

455
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:51,625
Where did you keep that purse
you stole from B12 bus?

456
00:36:51,791 --> 00:36:52,625
It is in my shorts.

457
00:36:52,833 --> 00:36:55,833
Oh no! Not this one, but the one
I put aside for washing.

458
00:36:56,041 --> 00:36:58,958
Tell that first. I don’t understand what
I’m taking in this hurry. Go and get that.

459
00:36:59,916 --> 00:37:02,208
-In how many busses did you loot
all these? -Just one bus!

460
00:37:02,416 --> 00:37:03,583
-Just one bus?
-Yes!

461
00:37:03,791 --> 00:37:05,541
You are no ordinary guy.
What’s this?

462
00:37:07,208 --> 00:37:09,166
How did you steel this nose ring?

463
00:37:09,375 --> 00:37:14,083
Middy babe and Bermuda boy were into
deep chatting and I stole it in that mess.

464
00:37:14,291 --> 00:37:16,375
You are a great thief, man.
Where is my purse?

465
00:37:17,791 --> 00:37:19,500
-This has money and it must be that.
-Yes, that is the one.

466
00:37:19,708 --> 00:37:20,333
Thank God, I got it.

467
00:37:20,541 --> 00:37:21,875
-Fine, I got it. Thanks, I’m leaving.
-Ok!

468
00:37:22,166 --> 00:37:23,833
What if someone else comes
again to give a complaint?

469
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:26,291
Hey, I need this entire bunch.
Please, man!

470
00:37:26,708 --> 00:37:29,333
-Just this one bunch, right?
-Just one?

471
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:30,958
How many more bunches
do you have?

472
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:33,958
-Sir! -What?
-My lungis!

473
00:37:34,166 --> 00:37:36,958
I’ll get them cleanly washed
and starched, you rascal.

474
00:37:37,541 --> 00:37:42,125
Sir, I’m back. I’m here, sir.
I’m here.

475
00:37:42,833 --> 00:37:45,833
Entire Alibaba treasure opened up
with just one complaint, sir.

476
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:51,708
Oh no, purse!
Here is your purse, sir.

477
00:37:54,083 --> 00:37:55,125
Sir, here is the ten thousand.

478
00:37:56,583 --> 00:38:00,416
-Here, sir! Brother, paper!
-I heard. Here, I’m tearing it.

479
00:38:02,125 --> 00:38:05,875
-Sir, I lost my slippers at the temple.
-One thousand or two?

480
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:08,750
You stop it, man. We’ll put in
our efforts for his slippers.

481
00:38:08,958 --> 00:38:11,791
Hey, put that table outside.
If he says the amount, that man

482
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,666
will pull from our pockets.

483
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:18,250
-Stop! -If you wish to give
complaint, you don’t need to come in.

484
00:38:18,458 --> 00:38:21,541
You can give it right here.
We’re always at your service.

485
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:27,666
Wow Sir, you set right everyone
with your brains. What a brain?

486
00:38:27,833 --> 00:38:29,083
I haven’t yet used it, man.

487
00:38:29,416 --> 00:38:32,291
-I'm in the vacation mood.
-Wow!

488
00:38:34,833 --> 00:38:36,375
Brother, special tea for you.

489
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,833
-What are you studying, kiddo?
-Studies?

490
00:38:40,125 --> 00:38:42,041
No facilities in the Government school
and I don’t have enough money

491
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:43,791
to study in private school.

492
00:38:44,125 --> 00:38:47,083
I’m an orphan, brother. I got to
keep selling tea and lead my life.

493
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:49,958
-Hey Rama, get two teas.
-Coming, brother.

494
00:38:50,166 --> 00:38:53,166
-Hey, what’s your name?
-Rama!

495
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:56,416
-See you, brother.
-Hey, wait!

496
00:38:57,416 --> 00:38:59,291
-What did you say?
-See you, brother!

497
00:39:02,041 --> 00:39:04,666
Hey, call me as brother
at least for once.

498
00:39:05,958 --> 00:39:07,875
-Call me brother for once.
-Brother!

499
00:39:08,208 --> 00:39:09,833
I know, you will not call me.

500
00:39:12,458 --> 00:39:15,000
-Call once again.
-Brother!

501
00:39:15,041 --> 00:39:18,083
You will call me as brother
someday, by yourself.

502
00:39:18,708 --> 00:39:20,041
I will not call, even at my death.

503
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,458
-Rao Sir!
-Yes!

504
00:40:08,166 --> 00:40:10,000
-Find it.
-What?

505
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,125
-Astrology!
-What?

506
00:40:22,333 --> 00:40:24,083
Ok, sir! Oh no!

507
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:29,666
-What are you seeing?
-Grandpa, I need an information.

508
00:40:29,875 --> 00:40:33,083
-Grandpa? -Hand is shaking
like a phone in vibration mode.

509
00:40:33,291 --> 00:40:34,250
Are you young?

510
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,291
-Correct! What do you need?
-I need the best Rowdy in this city.

511
00:40:41,833 --> 00:40:45,375
People come here to give complaints on
Rowdies and why are you here for Rowdies?

512
00:40:46,041 --> 00:40:49,375
-I must give my complaint to a Rowdy.
-Why?

513
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,958
Rowdies fix a deal when we go on
any work to them.

514
00:40:53,291 --> 00:40:55,333
Sincerity exists for sure in
their work.

515
00:40:55,958 --> 00:40:59,541
But if we go to Police, we need to pay
some money while giving the complaint.

516
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:01,583
And we got to pay some more
while following it up.

517
00:41:02,291 --> 00:41:05,416
There’s neither a clarity that
job is done and no fixed rate too.

518
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:10,208
You’ve pulled out all the strings
from the Khaki shirt. Super!

519
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,666
I’m like that.
There’s no filter to my mouth.

520
00:41:12,875 --> 00:41:15,583
-I get that.
-Say, who is the best Rowdy here?

521
00:41:15,875 --> 00:41:18,333
There’s just one Rowdy in this area.

522
00:41:18,541 --> 00:41:21,625
Everyone has left taking voluntary
retirement after he arrived.

523
00:41:21,833 --> 00:41:24,125
-Who is that?
-The one and only licensed Rowdy!

524
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:26,041
Bhimaa!

525
00:41:31,625 --> 00:41:33,916
-My name is Vidya.
-It is so cute.

526
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:36,666
-What? -Oh no!
-The name!

527
00:41:37,666 --> 00:41:39,208
I look very beautiful, right?

528
00:41:39,416 --> 00:41:41,500
Hey, it is a compliment and
not a complaint.

529
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:45,291
No, a guy named Romeo is
following me by saying to marry me.

530
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,666
By mistake, did you say him ok?

531
00:41:46,875 --> 00:41:48,541
-Damn, no way!
I have not said ok to him.

532
00:41:50,083 --> 00:41:52,708
But that guy is threatening to pour
acid on me if I don’t accept.

533
00:41:52,916 --> 00:41:54,333
Acid?
I’ll pour that in his pants.

534
00:41:54,541 --> 00:41:57,541
Pour it, but I first need
a body guard.

535
00:41:57,916 --> 00:41:59,416
You need a guard for your body?

536
00:41:59,625 --> 00:42:03,666
-What? -He’s the macho
and God for this entire place.

537
00:42:04,333 --> 00:42:06,083
Are you his personal orchestra?

538
00:42:06,375 --> 00:42:08,125
You’ve been beating it from
so far in his support.

539
00:42:08,333 --> 00:42:10,541
-That is our duty.
-Did you listen to it?

540
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:12,500
It is visible, right?

541
00:42:14,083 --> 00:42:17,041
You got to say your rate.
You shouldn’t keep asking repeatedly.

542
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:19,583
-For what?
-She is asking to be a body guard, sir.

543
00:42:19,916 --> 00:42:21,166
Oh, no need of any amount
for that.

544
00:42:21,375 --> 00:42:24,125
Grandpa, didn’t I say there’ll be
no clarity with Police?

545
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:27,875
Sir, madam is already fixed.
Why do you hurt her feelings?

546
00:42:28,083 --> 00:42:29,208
-Five thousand, madam!
-Oh no!

547
00:42:29,416 --> 00:42:31,541
Five thousand, don’t I get
any discount?

548
00:42:31,708 --> 00:42:32,875
This is not Kalamandir, madam.

549
00:42:35,416 --> 00:42:37,416
-Here is 500 as advance.
-What is this, Mr Rao?

550
00:42:37,625 --> 00:42:39,875
This is an advance for me, sir.
You advance now.

551
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:10,708
Sir, jeep is... not ready. Tire just got
punctured and you go on the bike, sir.

552
00:43:13,916 --> 00:43:15,916
You’ve kept the orchestra
everywhere in your station, right?

553
00:43:16,125 --> 00:43:18,250
-No, in the entire village.
-Fine, move now.

554
00:43:37,583 --> 00:43:39,000
-Excuse me!
-Yes!

555
00:43:39,333 --> 00:43:40,916
-Your number…
-I won’t give.

556
00:43:41,666 --> 00:43:45,250
You are my security and
you must come only when I ask.

557
00:43:46,166 --> 00:43:48,458
-I’ll call you myself.
-Oh, ok!

558
00:43:48,708 --> 00:43:50,333
If you get a opportunity
you will advance.

559
00:43:50,916 --> 00:43:54,208
I need to find that opportunity, right?
Look, how is she shaking?

560
00:44:15,083 --> 00:44:16,916
-Babu Rao!
-No sir, Kutumba Rao.

561
00:44:17,125 --> 00:44:18,416
-Ok, Babu Rao!
-Sir!

562
00:44:23,083 --> 00:44:24,458
Oh, madam!

563
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:26,875
She’s working here as a
part time teacher.

564
00:44:27,083 --> 00:44:29,541
She is also doing PhD in Botany
along with that.

565
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,708
She is a strict teacher and
a good student.

566
00:44:32,208 --> 00:44:33,208
Oh no!

567
00:44:35,958 --> 00:44:38,250
You should be going around
trees and bushes at this age.

568
00:44:38,416 --> 00:44:39,875
Why is this PhD on trees at
this age, my cutie?

569
00:44:40,041 --> 00:44:41,458
-Sir!
-What?

570
00:44:42,208 --> 00:44:42,958
Ok sir!

571
00:44:44,625 --> 00:44:45,500
Let’s see.

572
00:45:28,833 --> 00:45:30,583
I’ve been waiting just for you.

573
00:46:38,208 --> 00:46:40,041
You’re playing a ball game
with the world, sir.

574
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,000
-Orchestra is a bit loud, Mr Rao.
-Ok sir!

575
00:46:44,833 --> 00:46:46,041
-Hello!
-Is security there?

576
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:49,083
-He is here. Security!
-Hey! -Sir!

577
00:46:49,833 --> 00:46:51,541
-Madam’s phone.
-Oh!

578
00:46:53,083 --> 00:46:54,416
-Hello!
-Hey security!

579
00:46:54,916 --> 00:46:59,333
-Yes! -That Romeo is standing in side of
my school corridor holding the acid bottle.

580
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,500
Ask him to stay right there. I’ll see
his end. I’m coming right away.

581
00:47:01,541 --> 00:47:02,375
-Come on boys!
-Boys, come on!

582
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:09,875
Oh no, Police!
I won’t leave you.

583
00:47:10,208 --> 00:47:13,333
-I won’t get caught.
-Guys, catch him. He’s escaping.

584
00:47:13,541 --> 00:47:15,000
-Hey, stop idiot.
-I won’t stop.

585
00:47:15,208 --> 00:47:17,333
-True love, sir! Leave me.
-Hey, stop idiot.

586
00:47:21,291 --> 00:47:26,375
Why are you overacting like adding spices
worth a hundred for a food worth ten?

587
00:47:31,458 --> 00:47:32,791
Sorry Vidya, we missed him.

588
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,125
-I already knew you’d miss.
-How?

589
00:47:36,541 --> 00:47:40,833
I got a doubt you can’t catch him,
when you stopped the Jeep and ran.

590
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:44,625
-Fine, shall I drop you?
-No need.

591
00:47:45,083 --> 00:47:47,291
He went that way, right?
I’ll go this way.

592
00:47:48,166 --> 00:47:49,708
You are trying to take advantage
by finding a chance.

593
00:47:52,333 --> 00:47:54,750
When did you take advantage, sir?

594
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,750
-I didn’t take. She is trying to give it.
-Oh!

595
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:58,750
-Sir!
-Yes!

596
00:47:58,958 --> 00:48:02,333
You caught Romeo and
why did you lie he escaped?

597
00:48:03,166 --> 00:48:05,375
See now, dude!

598
00:48:08,375 --> 00:48:11,583
Idiot, you can follow a girl.
Every man does that.

599
00:48:11,875 --> 00:48:15,041
Even a male animal tries very hard
to impress the female,

600
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:16,541
but never threatens to kill it.

601
00:48:16,708 --> 00:48:18,500
We got to threaten, sir.
Otherwise, they don’t listen.

602
00:48:18,708 --> 00:48:20,083
This is also a part of true love.

603
00:48:21,166 --> 00:48:23,041
Correct dude, we got to threaten.
Or else, they don’t listen.

604
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:25,416
Thank you sir, you understood
it very well. Love you, thank you!

605
00:48:25,708 --> 00:48:27,958
-Hey, pour it on him.
-Oh no, what sir?

606
00:48:28,958 --> 00:48:30,833
-Acid!
-Oh no, acid?

607
00:48:31,083 --> 00:48:32,125
Come on, pour it!

608
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:35,875
Sir, I thought he’d pee in pants and
why does he say to pour it instead?

609
00:48:36,291 --> 00:48:38,166
-Give it here, once.
-Here, sir. -Give it.

610
00:48:38,375 --> 00:48:42,166
-You pour it, sir.
-What to pour, idiot?

611
00:48:42,625 --> 00:48:45,333
-Why are you like this, idiot?
-Will you really pour it now?

612
00:48:45,541 --> 00:48:49,833
-Sir, no please!
-No sir, he’ll die.

613
00:48:51,875 --> 00:48:54,000
This idiot mixed drinking soda in
baking soda.

614
00:48:54,208 --> 00:48:56,458
Oh no, this idiot looks
very cunning sir.

615
00:48:57,666 --> 00:48:58,625
Give me his mobile.

616
00:49:02,208 --> 00:49:04,375
-What did you save Vidya’s name as?
-Vidya, my love!

617
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:07,541
Vidya idiot, will you have
security round the clock?

618
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:10,041
I’ll come to your hostel tonight
and pour acid on you.

619
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:11,666
It’s wrong, sir. It’s a crime, sir.

620
00:49:11,916 --> 00:49:14,875
-What’s wrong? We can cook,
only when the pan heats up right?

621
00:49:17,291 --> 00:49:18,875
-Hello!
-Hey security!

622
00:49:19,833 --> 00:49:21,833
-It’s heated up, sir.
-Oh, it is very fast.

623
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:24,333
-No, Vidya!
-Why is he screaming?

624
00:49:25,375 --> 00:49:26,083
Hello!

625
00:49:26,291 --> 00:49:30,250
Romeo messaged saying to come to
the hostel and pour acid. Come fast!

626
00:49:35,958 --> 00:49:39,375
-From when are the Police so handsome?
-You idiot!

627
00:49:41,166 --> 00:49:46,791
-I’m ready even to get arrested.
I think he is a virgin. -Oh no!

628
00:49:48,375 --> 00:49:49,625
Sir, what is a virgin?

629
00:49:49,833 --> 00:49:51,083
-Are you from Telugu medium?
-Yes, sir!

630
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:55,041
-It means a good person.
-Then, I too am a virgin sir.

631
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:58,291
-Hey, shut up! -If not as much
as I am, you too are a bit virgin, brother.

632
00:49:58,458 --> 00:50:00,333
-Shut up! Soldiers!
-Lord!

633
00:50:00,583 --> 00:50:02,041
-Enter the dragon!
-Yay!

634
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:03,500
Hey, not my side.
That side!

635
00:50:05,041 --> 00:50:07,375
-Hey, will you directly come
into the room? -Yeah!

636
00:50:07,583 --> 00:50:11,375
-This is a ladies hostel,
can’t you see? -Is it? Really?

637
00:50:11,958 --> 00:50:13,208
-Who are you?
-Security!

638
00:50:13,791 --> 00:50:15,291
-Where should you be?
-At the gate!

639
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:23,166
Mosquitoes might bite if he is out.
Poor guy will have to scratch.

640
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:27,125
-You’d scratch if he comes in.
-No, listen to me.

641
00:50:27,333 --> 00:50:29,666
-Move now. Move!
-Oh no!

642
00:50:30,291 --> 00:50:32,291
-My Lord, she is coming on to us.
-No,no... -Sir!

643
00:50:34,541 --> 00:50:38,375
-Hey, don’t sleep. -How can
I sleep after watching all this?

644
00:50:39,083 --> 00:50:39,958
Ok!

645
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,041
He takes advantage whenever
there is a chance.

646
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:04,500
I think pan is over heated and
the food got roasted.

647
00:51:04,666 --> 00:51:08,291
Sir, when we are so virgin,
why is madam not at all virgin?

648
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:11,708
Idiot, do you know the meaning
of virgin or not?

649
00:51:14,375 --> 00:51:17,583
-Madam, you go in and sir will be
in rounds right here. -Yes!

650
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,375
-Hey Bhattu!
-My Lord!

651
00:51:20,583 --> 00:51:23,041
You will feel very happy if
they are sent in, right?

652
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:26,750
-Do you have any objection if I’m in
their room in five minutes? -Impossible!

653
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:29,166
-You know, what a great man said?
-What did he say?

654
00:51:29,708 --> 00:51:32,791
-Impossible or my foot!
-Oh no!

655
00:51:41,708 --> 00:51:43,875
Baking soda with drinking soda!

656
00:51:48,416 --> 00:51:51,583
Oh no!
Sara, Acid! Run!

657
00:51:53,125 --> 00:51:55,833
-Hey, what are you doing?
-I’m killing the mosquitoes.

658
00:51:56,041 --> 00:51:58,583
He threw acid inside the room.
What are you sitting there and doing?

659
00:51:59,166 --> 00:52:01,083
-Who am I?
-Security!

660
00:52:02,916 --> 00:52:05,083
-Where should I be?
-At the gate!

661
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:11,500
That’s why I told, I’ll take
great care if I’m close by.

662
00:52:12,333 --> 00:52:13,416
Ask him to come in.

663
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:17,250
Come!

664
00:52:17,416 --> 00:52:18,458
-Bhattu!
-My Lord!

665
00:52:18,791 --> 00:52:21,208
-What’s she saying?
-She’s asking you to come in, Lord.

666
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,166
-Oh no!
-You fools, pan isn’t over heated.

667
00:52:25,666 --> 00:52:28,791
When tiger cooks the tiger rice,
it will be always nice.

668
00:52:29,125 --> 00:52:29,958
What?

669
00:52:30,166 --> 00:52:32,000
-He didn’t understand, explain.
-Ok!

670
00:52:44,041 --> 00:52:48,791
“I’m flat thinking it is some magic”

671
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:54,125
“Was that a pleasure when
the Lord created you?”

672
00:52:54,916 --> 00:52:59,791
“Maybe your colour is to be
asked to look beautiful”

673
00:53:00,083 --> 00:53:05,041
“Are there comparisons in
any language to say about you?”

674
00:53:27,833 --> 00:53:32,666
“I’m flat thinking it is some magic”

675
00:53:33,083 --> 00:53:38,208
“Was that a pleasure when
the Lord created you?”

676
00:54:11,458 --> 00:54:16,666
“Is it true I’m with you?
Is this a boon to me?”

677
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,291
“Ego, don't come for a while”

678
00:54:18,375 --> 00:54:20,708
Hey Stop, Stop, Stop!
-Where are you going?

679
00:54:20,958 --> 00:54:23,875
I’m going to see Ravindra Varma garu,
the great Ayurveda wizard.

680
00:54:24,083 --> 00:54:26,083
I’m working on my research there.

681
00:54:26,083 --> 00:54:30,541
-Oh, is he your Guru!
-He’s more than Guru, a father figure to me.

682
00:54:30,541 --> 00:54:33,000
"You own my complete life"

683
00:54:33,166 --> 00:54:43,500
"You changed my hesitation
into a song"

684
00:54:58,916 --> 00:55:01,833
-Hey Rama!
-Brother?

685
00:55:02,125 --> 00:55:04,208
-Take these new clothes.
-Why, brother?

686
00:55:04,541 --> 00:55:06,875
-Tomorrow is my birthday. -Why new
clothes for me on your birthday, brother?

687
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,625
“I’m flat thinking it is some magic”
-It’s all right. -Thanks, brother.

688
00:55:12,125 --> 00:55:17,166
“Was that a pleasure when
the Lord created you?”

689
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:47,958
When did they reopen
this school, grandpa?

690
00:55:48,166 --> 00:55:51,750
A Police man came here like a God
to wipe out poor children's problems.

691
00:55:52,541 --> 00:55:53,625
He is Bhimaa.

692
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:58,083
Yay!

693
00:56:00,208 --> 00:56:01,500
Come fast, madam.

694
00:56:02,916 --> 00:56:05,666
-Say something.
-You say it.

695
00:56:08,166 --> 00:56:09,708
I love you!

696
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:19,250
No problem, it'll be down.

697
00:56:28,166 --> 00:56:30,916
Will my baby’s fever come down
by taking this medicine, madam?

698
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:33,125
Why did you delay so much?

699
00:56:33,458 --> 00:56:36,083
We came in the night, madam.
They said master wasn’t there.

700
00:56:36,666 --> 00:56:40,666
Don’t you know? Master will not
meet anyone after Sunset.

701
00:56:40,875 --> 00:56:43,041
-He doesn’t even give treatment.
-Why?

702
00:56:43,291 --> 00:56:46,416
It is a great sin to cut the plants
after Sunset.

703
00:56:48,416 --> 00:56:52,083
-No problem, take this.
It’ll be down. -Drink!

704
00:57:25,791 --> 00:57:27,041
-Guru ji?
-Yes!

705
00:57:39,166 --> 00:57:40,708
Very rare plant!

706
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:43,916
It has great medicinal values.

707
00:57:44,791 --> 00:57:49,166
We can save many lives using
this plant.

708
00:57:56,375 --> 00:57:57,541
Namaste Guruji!

709
00:57:57,958 --> 00:58:03,000
Medicine is equivalent to God!
May all be good!

710
00:58:03,291 --> 00:58:06,208
You are the reason for us to be
so happy, master.

711
00:58:06,458 --> 00:58:10,041
My baby’s health didn’t get better
though we visited so many hospitals

712
00:58:10,375 --> 00:58:12,041
and spent lots of money.

713
00:58:12,666 --> 00:58:15,250
My baby lived with your treatment.

714
00:58:16,458 --> 00:58:18,125
You are a God to us.

715
00:58:18,291 --> 00:58:21,916
This is not my greatness.
It is the greatness of this land.

716
00:58:22,583 --> 00:58:27,416
Sanjivini medicine which can reward life to
the dead person is grown in this land of India.

717
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,666
Don’t we get a medicine for
these diseases?

718
00:58:30,833 --> 00:58:34,625
Master, they say plants with great
medicinal values exist in Himalayas.

719
00:58:35,041 --> 00:58:36,166
Do you bring these from there?

720
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:41,166
Not just the Himalayas! Even this
land you are standing on is great.

721
00:58:42,458 --> 00:58:45,416
One among the seven eternal
beings is Parasurama.

722
00:58:45,791 --> 00:58:48,416
This is the land where
Parasurama lived.

723
00:58:48,625 --> 00:58:52,416
Plants growing here have great
medicinal values.

724
00:58:53,458 --> 00:58:57,583
They have the power to cure
any disease.

725
00:58:57,750 --> 00:59:03,125
We may even find Sanjivini, by
searching with a stubborn will power.

726
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:04,583
Is it true, master?

727
00:59:06,166 --> 00:59:08,708
This is impossible for
the human beings.

728
00:59:09,708 --> 00:59:15,416
A great person specially born for
this cause must come for this task.

729
00:59:27,666 --> 00:59:31,000
-Namaste sir, my name is…
-Bhimaa!

730
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:33,750
You are the new SI coming to
this village.

731
00:59:34,291 --> 00:59:37,375
I heard you are doing great works
immediately after arriving here.

732
00:59:37,541 --> 00:59:39,541
-I wanted to see once.
-Oh!

733
00:59:41,166 --> 00:59:46,333
You saw me, right?
Are you happy now?

734
00:59:52,416 --> 00:59:55,166
Bhimaa, I have a small request.

735
00:59:56,416 --> 01:00:00,333
An ancient temple in our village
is closed down from five decades.

736
01:00:03,458 --> 01:00:05,416
I’ve been waiting for you.

737
01:00:06,125 --> 01:00:09,791
We’ve been trying from so many
years to get that opened.

738
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
They told, some cases are
pending in the court.

739
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:16,250
A temple without worship is like
the baby without mother’s lap.

740
01:00:16,666 --> 01:00:21,875
We’re unable to witness the temple barren
like this, it instead had to glow in charm.

741
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:26,041
Will you help in getting it opened?

742
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:38,000
That Bhimaa is disturbing us
a lot, brother.

743
01:00:40,916 --> 01:00:44,666
Bhimaa closed down all our business
just in few days after he arrived here.

744
01:00:45,458 --> 01:00:48,708
If it goes the same way, I feel he’ll
get to know even about our tankers.

745
01:00:58,125 --> 01:01:00,250
-Can we send tanker?
-Yes, you can.

746
01:01:07,291 --> 01:01:10,958
If we bring in our batch from forest,
they’ll finish that Bhimaa.

747
01:01:14,833 --> 01:01:16,250
You just say yes for once, brother.

748
01:01:35,625 --> 01:01:37,500
-Give that register.
-Sir!

749
01:01:37,833 --> 01:01:38,583
Give that.

750
01:01:56,625 --> 01:01:57,500
Give me that phone.

751
01:02:24,833 --> 01:02:25,750
Give that torch.

752
01:02:27,041 --> 01:02:29,708
Brother, it seems Bhimaa came
to the check post.

753
01:03:39,875 --> 01:03:41,541
Sir, permit for those two vehicles!

754
01:03:45,125 --> 01:03:46,333
Sir, shall I let them go?

755
01:03:47,833 --> 01:03:48,750
Hey, let them go.

756
01:04:07,083 --> 01:04:10,125
Sir, you are silent even after
knowing Bhavani is doing all this.

757
01:04:10,375 --> 01:04:11,833
Are you waiting for Rudra, sir?

758
01:04:14,166 --> 01:04:18,333
There is some other person
behind these two.

759
01:04:26,250 --> 01:04:27,458
Why did you ask me to stop
here, sir?

760
01:04:28,208 --> 01:04:30,833
I’ve a small work. You go to
the station and I’ll come there.

761
01:04:34,125 --> 01:04:37,041
Brother, Ravinder Varma asked for
Bhimaa's help in reopening the temple .

762
01:04:39,583 --> 01:04:40,625
What?

763
01:04:45,333 --> 01:04:48,916
-Dad!
-Ask Tandava to finish the work fast.

764
01:05:05,375 --> 01:05:07,375
-Damn!
-What happened?

765
01:05:07,875 --> 01:05:10,041
That truck driver is not answering
the phone, brother.

766
01:05:11,416 --> 01:05:12,833
What are you talking, idiot?

767
01:05:33,708 --> 01:05:35,833
Brother, he is not answering
the calls at all.

768
01:05:36,291 --> 01:05:37,916
What happened to tanker, idiot?

769
01:05:38,083 --> 01:05:39,583
Sir, accident it seems!

770
01:05:41,083 --> 01:05:44,333
We got a call from the control room.
Ambulance driver is not answering the call.

771
01:05:44,541 --> 01:05:46,666
I’ll go and bring him.
You both go with Sir.

772
01:06:23,291 --> 01:06:25,958
Sir, both the driver and cleaner
are dead.

773
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:46,625
Chandra!

774
01:06:57,541 --> 01:06:58,416
Oh no!

775
01:06:59,833 --> 01:07:01,000
Sir!

776
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:20,916
(Child crying)

777
01:08:23,375 --> 01:08:25,875
-(Child crying)
-Brother, come fast.

778
01:08:26,083 --> 01:08:28,875
Hey, Ambulance driver fell down
after getting drunk.

779
01:08:29,208 --> 01:08:31,541
Vehicle is struck in sand
at Sivaiah Jalar.

780
01:08:41,541 --> 01:08:44,541
-Brother!
-Brother!

781
01:08:46,916 --> 01:08:49,500
Sir, it seems Ambulance tire is
stuck in sand at Sivaiah Jalar.

782
01:08:49,708 --> 01:08:52,000
These will not leave us.
Many more will come soon.

783
01:08:54,208 --> 01:08:57,791
Sir, there is a shortcut to
beach road thorigh this forest.

784
01:08:58,041 --> 01:09:01,541
But, how do we go taking
all these children with us, sir?

785
01:09:04,958 --> 01:09:07,625
Brother, will we die?

786
01:09:10,166 --> 01:09:11,291
Don’t be scared.

787
01:09:12,583 --> 01:09:15,166
Even that death should fear today
by seeing your courage.

788
01:09:16,625 --> 01:09:20,916
Even that God of death can’t touch
you when this Bhimaa is with you.

789
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:23,875
This is my word.

790
01:11:38,166 --> 01:11:41,958
Brother, we cannot stop him
anymore. You have to enter now.

791
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Sir!

792
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:13,416
Brother!

793
01:12:18,333 --> 01:12:19,708
Run!

794
01:16:22,208 --> 01:16:37,083
(Hanuman chalisa)

795
01:16:50,833 --> 01:17:07,875
(Praises to Lord Shiva)

796
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:41,916
“Hey Lord Shiva, I just wish
to be in your shadow”

797
01:17:42,416 --> 01:17:50,791
“Hey kind Lord Shiva,
we just need your protection”

798
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:55,625
“You just reside in the heart”

799
01:17:55,791 --> 01:17:59,416
“Hey Lord, bless us”

800
01:17:59,625 --> 01:18:06,208
"We seek your mercy, hey Lord"

801
01:18:09,041 --> 01:18:13,000
“Holy is the Lord’s name”

802
01:18:13,250 --> 01:18:17,083
“Holy is the Lord’s appearance”

803
01:18:17,583 --> 01:18:21,666
“Holy is the Lord’s name”

804
01:18:21,958 --> 01:18:25,708
“Holy is the Lord’s appearance”

805
01:18:48,041 --> 01:18:49,125
What about you, son?

806
01:18:50,916 --> 01:18:52,666
God will give you himself.

807
01:18:54,833 --> 01:18:55,875
Who knows what he gives?

808
01:18:56,541 --> 01:18:59,500
Ask for once and see, that God
himself might come to you.

809
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,208
-What will he come tome?
-Hey, did you get what I asked?

810
01:19:06,041 --> 01:19:09,041
Idiot, why did you bring
less coconuts?

811
01:19:09,541 --> 01:19:12,208
Uncle, he always gave
six for a hundred, but gave just

812
01:19:12,416 --> 01:19:13,458
five now by increasing the price.

813
01:19:13,666 --> 01:19:14,833
Why couldn’t you ask him
stubbornly?

814
01:19:15,041 --> 01:19:16,583
He looked angrily, when I
tried asking.

815
01:19:16,916 --> 01:19:18,791
I felt my head is important than
the coconuts and

816
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,541
came back running from there.

817
01:19:21,875 --> 01:19:25,291
Priest post you have support to get,
went to that idiotic Siddanthi

818
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:29,708
as you kept silent for everything.

819
01:19:30,416 --> 01:19:33,375
Everyone would take advantage
of you, if you be cool like this.

820
01:19:33,583 --> 01:19:36,583
They are breaking and eating even if we
are hard like the coconut, uncle.

821
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:40,500
Hey idiot, put those
50 coconuts in this bag.

822
01:19:40,750 --> 01:19:42,208
There are just 5 coconuts,
right uncle?

823
01:19:42,416 --> 01:19:44,791
Just 5, but I’ve written 50 here.

824
01:19:45,166 --> 01:19:49,416
Oh God, are you swallowing God’s money
by chatting 45 and writing as 50 coconuts?

825
01:19:50,041 --> 01:19:55,500
To hell with you! Is that God
any foody to swallow 50 coconuts?

826
01:19:55,833 --> 01:19:57,916
We are writing it so, to fulfil
our hunger. That’s it.

827
01:19:58,125 --> 01:19:59,791
Do we need so many for our
hunger, uncle?

828
01:20:00,583 --> 01:20:04,208
I’m saving all this for my huddle wife.

829
01:20:04,416 --> 01:20:06,250
-Who is it, uncle?
-Mandaram!

830
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:08,583
Oh God!
She is mother of Pari, right?

831
01:20:08,791 --> 01:20:11,416
You chicken head, what did
our Chanakya say?

832
01:20:11,791 --> 01:20:14,208
It is not important if the girl is
first hand or second hand.

833
01:20:14,416 --> 01:20:16,625
That great man said it is not important
first or second but

834
01:20:16,833 --> 01:20:17,833
as long as she doesn’t betray us.

835
01:20:18,041 --> 01:20:19,416
Did Chanakya say this really?

836
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:25,416
You fool! people will only believe if we say
Chanakya said it, for anything we want to say.

837
01:20:26,625 --> 01:20:28,833
“This is the silence from
going speechless”

838
01:20:30,333 --> 01:20:31,791
Why did the look turn that side?

839
01:20:33,625 --> 01:20:35,958
“This is the silence from
going speechless”

840
01:20:40,625 --> 01:20:42,250
Is she aware that you are in
love with her?

841
01:20:42,416 --> 01:20:44,875
Why would she let go a handsome
man like me if she knows?

842
01:20:45,458 --> 01:20:47,250
-I didn’t tell.
-Why, are you scared?

843
01:20:47,458 --> 01:20:52,083
You fool, it is not enough just to get
a cow. We also need grass to feed it.

844
01:20:52,291 --> 01:20:53,500
I’m accumulating the same.

845
01:20:53,708 --> 01:20:56,166
There is no use now after your
age is over, uncle.

846
01:20:56,375 --> 01:21:00,375
Age doesn’t matter. Youth blossoms
when you are in love.

847
01:21:00,583 --> 01:21:02,833
-Our time is over here.
-For what, love?

848
01:21:03,041 --> 01:21:05,583
For the account! We need to
urgently go to the school.

849
01:21:12,458 --> 01:21:14,833
Rama!
Children, silence!

850
01:21:15,833 --> 01:21:18,333
Aren’t you frustrated when
children are making so much noise?

851
01:21:18,708 --> 01:21:19,958
Why don’t you ask them to
stop that noise?

852
01:21:20,458 --> 01:21:22,500
If not now when can children
make noise ?

853
01:21:22,708 --> 01:21:25,916
Once they grow old, even their
faces will go frustrated like yours.

854
01:21:26,125 --> 01:21:27,750
Thus, don’t try to control them.

855
01:21:27,958 --> 01:21:29,958
They turn into donkeys if we
don’t control at all.

856
01:21:30,333 --> 01:21:32,291
These aren’t donkeys.
But are Gods.

857
01:21:33,708 --> 01:21:36,000
Thus elders say God exists
in children.

858
01:21:36,208 --> 01:21:37,875
Sir, this God pinched me.

859
01:21:38,083 --> 01:21:39,833
You too are a God, right?
You too pinch back.

860
01:21:40,041 --> 01:21:42,166
What can I do in between, when
two Gods pinch each other?

861
01:21:43,416 --> 01:21:45,958
Rama, oh no!
Oh God!

862
01:21:47,625 --> 01:21:50,000
Hey Rama! What is this?

863
01:21:51,125 --> 01:21:54,541
Don’t you have at least 10% liking on me,
from what you show on those kids?

864
01:21:57,375 --> 01:21:59,583
I told ‘I love you’ so many times
to you.

865
01:21:59,875 --> 01:22:01,666
Did you say ‘I love you’ to me
at least for once?

866
01:22:03,333 --> 01:22:04,791
Oh no, Pari!

867
01:22:05,708 --> 01:22:06,875
When will you pick me up?

868
01:22:07,083 --> 01:22:08,333
Bring down your weight a bit
and I’ll try.

869
01:22:08,541 --> 01:22:10,916
Oh my, Rama cracked a joke.

870
01:22:11,125 --> 01:22:12,666
When will you take me away
from my home?

871
01:22:13,250 --> 01:22:14,375
Are you really a man?

872
01:22:15,041 --> 01:22:18,541
What are you talking, Pari? I was going into
men’s toilet as a kid. Why is that doubt?

873
01:22:18,791 --> 01:22:22,333
A man shouldn’t pee himself, but
should make the opposite people pee.

874
01:22:22,541 --> 01:22:26,625
Pari, our idiot is daily taking all
the students here to pee right?

875
01:22:26,833 --> 01:22:28,291
Hey you, dirty idiot!

876
01:22:28,958 --> 01:22:34,375
No Pari, don’t you talk to me like that. I'd have
been in the place of your father. I just missed it.

877
01:22:34,541 --> 01:22:39,458
See, he is in love with my mother even
at this age of receiving pension.

878
01:22:40,625 --> 01:22:41,791
Then, why can’t you love?

879
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,875
-Oh no Pari, how can I love
your mother? -Oh no, Rama!

880
01:22:44,083 --> 01:22:46,750
Oh God, I can’t bear with his jokes.

881
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,375
Instead of loving a coward like you,
better myself elope you someday.

882
01:22:49,583 --> 01:22:53,458
It is wrong Pari, you are engaged to
our priest’s son Bhattachari, right?

883
01:22:53,666 --> 01:22:57,750
When my dad threatened to hang himself,
I put my finger in that ring being scared.

884
01:22:58,125 --> 01:23:00,041
Only you have the right over me.

885
01:23:00,541 --> 01:23:03,500
This fool doesn’t have right even
on his attire. He let goes when

886
01:23:03,708 --> 01:23:06,541
someone snatches that with
a feeling not to get into a fight.

887
01:23:06,875 --> 01:23:10,333
Is it so? Will you let go if someone
snatches me away?

888
01:23:10,625 --> 01:23:12,458
I and your attire are the same
for you?

889
01:23:12,916 --> 01:23:15,041
Oh no, Bhattachari is watching.

890
01:23:15,541 --> 01:23:16,708
Hey Rama!

891
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:22,083
How many times do I tell you
not to mess with Pari?

892
01:23:22,291 --> 01:23:24,291
Engagement means, she is
half married.

893
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:26,541
I’m half husband to Pari now.

894
01:23:26,750 --> 01:23:29,458
Idiot, I feel like husband though
her mom is fully married.

895
01:23:29,625 --> 01:23:30,625
-Sarangi!
-Ok!

896
01:23:30,833 --> 01:23:32,291
-Rama!
-Oh no!

897
01:23:32,916 --> 01:23:34,583
Hey Sarangi, look at him.

898
01:23:34,916 --> 01:23:39,625
-You look like a bull and you fear about
these squirrels? -A squirrel?

899
01:23:40,958 --> 01:23:44,583
Hey Pari, how did you fall in love
with such a coward?

900
01:23:44,833 --> 01:23:47,958
Do I replay and show how I
fell in love with him?

901
01:23:48,583 --> 01:23:51,416
-You’ll die in jealous.
-Did you go so far, Pari?

902
01:23:51,583 --> 01:23:54,083
No, I went so close.

903
01:23:54,291 --> 01:23:56,875
-Pari, how could you get so careless?
Come, idiot. -Get lost!

904
01:23:57,083 --> 01:23:58,541
Hey Rama! I’ll see your end.

905
01:23:58,750 --> 01:24:00,000
-Come, Pari!
-Rama!

906
01:24:00,375 --> 01:24:04,583
Let anybody marry me.
But, I’ll come back to you.

907
01:24:04,791 --> 01:24:06,125
I love you, Rama.

908
01:24:06,208 --> 01:24:09,125
-Why is her mom not like her?
- I love you, Rama.

909
01:24:10,833 --> 01:24:15,375
Rama, we shouldn’t give so much
lenience to kids. We are after all…

910
01:24:15,458 --> 01:24:19,291
I was posted there day before and
am again posted there. No idea what to do.

911
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:20,875
I too am posted there tomorrow.
Let's go together.

912
01:24:21,083 --> 01:24:21,791
-Namaste, sir!
-Namaste!

913
01:24:22,125 --> 01:24:23,333
To hell with these night duties!

914
01:24:24,291 --> 01:24:28,625
Why do you fear? It won’t happen
so every time. Come!

915
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:38,125
In! Out!
In! Out!

916
01:24:38,958 --> 01:24:42,125
-Yeah! -Why is this priest
wining all the time at playing cards?

917
01:24:42,333 --> 01:24:45,250
Is it written in constitution that
a priest’s son shouldn’t play cards?

918
01:24:45,458 --> 01:24:47,875
No, but run now. Police is coming.
Run, guys.

919
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:50,875
When they’re all running away
seeing me, why didn’t you run?

920
01:24:51,083 --> 01:24:52,208
Don’t you fear about me?

921
01:24:52,416 --> 01:24:56,958
I make others run, but Bhimaa
doesn’t run by seeing someone.

922
01:24:57,166 --> 01:24:58,541
How egoistic are you, rascal?

923
01:24:58,916 --> 01:25:02,166
I don’t know how much, but a machine
to measure that isn’t invented yet.

924
01:25:02,375 --> 01:25:04,708
You dirty kid, come here.
Come on!

925
01:25:05,750 --> 01:25:07,500
You rascal, come here.
Come on!

926
01:25:08,083 --> 01:25:09,375
Idiot, I won't leave you.

927
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:11,666
Don't cry, Rama.

928
01:25:11,875 --> 01:25:13,291
Today is Pari’s birthday.

929
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:17,625
I saved one rupee with difficulty
to buy something for her.

930
01:25:17,833 --> 01:25:21,708
That dirty rascal Bhimaa stole
my one rupee.

931
01:25:21,916 --> 01:25:24,833
Hey look, Bhimaa is coming.

932
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:28,458
-Why are you crying?
-You stole my one rupee.

933
01:25:28,625 --> 01:25:29,583
Who the hell are you?

934
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:32,583
-I’m Mr Shankara Bhagavathulu’s
son Rama. -Shut up!

935
01:25:33,750 --> 01:25:38,166
You are Bhimaa’s younger brother Raama,
means more valuable than Bhimaa.

936
01:25:38,375 --> 01:25:41,958
You must give a valuable gift
to Pari. Take these ten rupees.

937
01:25:42,625 --> 01:25:43,958
Oh no, ten rupees?

938
01:25:44,833 --> 01:25:47,333
Call me as brother and I’ll give.

939
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:49,458
-Leave me, I’ll call.
-Will you really call me?

940
01:25:49,666 --> 01:25:50,791
I’ll really call you.
Leave me.

941
01:25:50,958 --> 01:25:53,166
-Will you call me for sure?
-I’ll surely call, leave me.

942
01:25:53,791 --> 01:25:54,708
Come on, run!

943
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,791
-Call me as brother.
-Get lost!

944
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,875
You’ll someday call me as brother
and ask me to come.

945
01:26:00,083 --> 01:26:01,833
I'll never call you as brother.

946
01:26:02,791 --> 01:26:06,875
-Buy me a peppermint Rama.
-Let’s buy bangles first.

947
01:26:07,125 --> 01:26:08,708
Give me a dozen bangles.

948
01:26:08,916 --> 01:26:13,250
Idiot, you pushed me there and
are now buying bangles here?

949
01:26:13,458 --> 01:26:16,333
-You play cards at this age, idiot?
-No sir, please!

950
01:26:20,208 --> 01:26:23,875
Priest sir, your son is arrested.
SI sir called you to the station.

951
01:26:24,208 --> 01:26:25,458
What have you done, Bhimaa rascal?

952
01:26:25,541 --> 01:26:27,416
If something happens to Raama
I will kill you.

953
01:26:28,875 --> 01:26:31,708
Rama!
Sir, please forgive me.

954
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,166
Rama hasn’t done the wrong.
It was Bhimaa.

955
01:26:36,375 --> 01:26:39,291
-Listen to me. -I brought
that idiot to apologise, sir.

956
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:42,166
Our constable manhandled the kid
by mistake. You must forgive us.

957
01:26:42,416 --> 01:26:43,416
You first be seated.

958
01:26:49,208 --> 01:26:51,791
-Who hit you?
-Get lost, idiot.

959
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:56,041
I’m always into troubles because
of you. I don’t like you. Get lost.

960
01:27:04,750 --> 01:27:05,916
Hey, stop!

961
01:27:06,375 --> 01:27:07,250
-Sir!
-Hey!

962
01:27:08,583 --> 01:27:11,166
Hey, stop dude.

963
01:27:11,625 --> 01:27:15,125
See, he is a demon.
He is born to me by mistake.

964
01:27:15,291 --> 01:27:18,041
No idea what was my sin to
have a curse like him?

965
01:27:19,083 --> 01:27:21,625
God hasn’t given you a curse, sir.
It is a boon.

966
01:27:21,833 --> 01:27:22,916
-A boon?
-Yes sir!

967
01:27:23,666 --> 01:27:26,166
Ramaa knows the tradition and
he will serve God.

968
01:27:26,708 --> 01:27:30,291
But Bhimaa has the courage, sir.
He can serve people if we can mould him.

969
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:33,708
No sir, he is born to me wrongly.
Put him in jail.

970
01:27:33,875 --> 01:27:38,791
Sir, if you have no objection
can I adopt Bhimaa?

971
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:42,083
Do as you wish.
I’ll do his final rites, today itself.

972
01:27:42,333 --> 01:27:45,916
I just have only one son, Ramaa.
You are dead to me.

973
01:27:49,333 --> 01:27:50,208
Let’s go, Ramaa.

974
01:27:52,833 --> 01:27:57,833
-Hey Rama, call me brother once.
-Get lost.

975
01:28:00,125 --> 01:28:02,250
-Will you be a Police?
-Will you give me the gun?

976
01:28:02,833 --> 01:28:03,583
Why?

977
01:28:14,416 --> 01:28:15,541
What happened, dear?

978
01:28:15,750 --> 01:28:20,166
His memories are haunting me as curses,
though he's not in front of my eyes.

979
01:28:21,166 --> 01:28:26,208
No idea what sin I committed in previous
births, I'm now born as Bhimaa's brother.

980
01:28:27,625 --> 01:28:29,541
Hey Bhimaa, for these memories
to vanish from me...

981
01:28:30,416 --> 01:28:34,166
Either I must die,
or he should die.

982
01:28:37,125 --> 01:28:38,958
Hey, they threw down some body.

983
01:28:41,666 --> 01:28:42,583
Jump, guys.

984
01:28:45,208 --> 01:28:46,208
Hey, it is Bhimaa brother!

985
01:28:47,291 --> 01:28:48,125
Careful!

986
01:28:53,166 --> 01:28:56,333
Bhimaa brother!
Bhimaa brother!

987
01:28:58,625 --> 01:29:00,416
You saved me by risking your lives.

988
01:29:01,458 --> 01:29:02,958
I’ll always be indebted to you.

989
01:29:03,458 --> 01:29:05,166
We are indebted to you, sir.

990
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:09,083
Yes sir! We gave up even hunting,
with a fear once that

991
01:29:09,291 --> 01:29:14,208
thieves and goons may come
and harm our families.

992
01:29:14,541 --> 01:29:19,000
Attacks stopped after you arrived.
This whole village changed, sir.

993
01:29:19,708 --> 01:29:23,833
We too are able to go hunting
in sea by leaving our families.

994
01:29:24,583 --> 01:29:26,583
You are a boon to us from God, Sir.

995
01:29:32,333 --> 01:29:34,083
Why are you sitting alone here, brother?

996
01:29:34,833 --> 01:29:36,291
Here is your special tea, brother.

997
01:29:39,541 --> 01:29:41,250
-Call me as brother once again.
-Brother!

998
01:29:45,208 --> 01:29:47,583
Why do you feel so happy when
you are called as brother?

999
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:50,875
-What is your name, kiddo?
-Rama!

1000
01:29:57,666 --> 01:30:01,708
Ramaa, don’t be sad as your father
passed away. I’m here for you.

1001
01:30:01,875 --> 01:30:04,500
-Whichever problem you are into, I’ll be
there for you. -Hey Pari, what is this?

1002
01:30:04,750 --> 01:30:05,916
-Dad!
-Get up!

1003
01:30:06,916 --> 01:30:10,375
-Dad! -How many times do I tell
you not to be with this dirty fellow?

1004
01:30:10,875 --> 01:30:13,458
-Idiot, your dad was proud of being
the main priest. -No sir!

1005
01:30:13,666 --> 01:30:15,083
-He supressed me in that profession.
-No sir!

1006
01:30:15,250 --> 01:30:17,083
-Now, you’re trying to snatch
my daughter. -No sir!

1007
01:30:17,291 --> 01:30:21,041
If you look at her or be with
her again, I’ll finish you rascal.

1008
01:30:21,250 --> 01:30:22,750
-You move now. Come on!
-Rama!

1009
01:30:29,416 --> 01:30:32,041
-You hit my brother, idiot?
-Oh no!

1010
01:30:42,666 --> 01:30:45,916
Not just my daughter,
I won’t let you touch temple door too.

1011
01:30:46,166 --> 01:30:50,166
Go through this for being born as
brother to Bhimaa idiot. Come on!

1012
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:54,750
Hey Rama, what happened?

1013
01:30:54,958 --> 01:30:57,875
Hey stop! Why do you have
so much anger on me?

1014
01:30:58,250 --> 01:30:59,375
Why are you haunting me?

1015
01:30:59,541 --> 01:31:01,583
Whatever I do, is to keep you happy.

1016
01:31:01,791 --> 01:31:04,666
My life is completely ruined
because of your aggressive nature.

1017
01:31:04,875 --> 01:31:06,041
-Hey Rama!
-Huh!

1018
01:31:06,250 --> 01:31:08,791
You know the curse I got?
It is to be born with your features.

1019
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:13,833
If you come in front of me or try to talk
with me again, I will end my own life.

1020
01:31:14,041 --> 01:31:15,416
This is my promise on that Lord Shiva.

1021
01:31:20,750 --> 01:31:23,250
Call me as brother for once and
I’ll go away.

1022
01:31:23,458 --> 01:31:24,583
Hey, get lost.

1023
01:31:31,958 --> 01:31:34,916
-Call me as brother once again.
-Brother!

1024
01:31:45,458 --> 01:31:48,000
Bhimaa, what is this?

1025
01:31:48,416 --> 01:31:49,541
What happened, Bhimaa?

1026
01:31:57,958 --> 01:32:01,458
‘Garala Suchi Mukham’, most
dangerous war technique used

1027
01:32:01,625 --> 01:32:03,916
by the sea pirates from
the olden days!

1028
01:32:04,541 --> 01:32:09,375
Poison is shattered and showed
no effect as you fell in the sea water.

1029
01:32:10,625 --> 01:32:14,208
You came back alive though
poisoned and thrown in the sea.

1030
01:32:14,416 --> 01:32:17,125
Yours is not any ordinary fate.

1031
01:32:19,791 --> 01:32:22,041
You have the fate of deciding
your own death.

1032
01:32:22,666 --> 01:32:23,541
Brother!

1033
01:32:27,958 --> 01:32:31,291
-Brother, you are safe right?
-I’m fine, dear.

1034
01:32:32,458 --> 01:32:34,958
Brother, we don’t know who our
parents are.

1035
01:32:35,333 --> 01:32:36,958
We don’t have a place or name
of our own.

1036
01:32:37,166 --> 01:32:39,250
They scold us when we
approach someone.

1037
01:32:39,583 --> 01:32:41,833
They beat us when we feel
hungry and ask for food.

1038
01:32:42,083 --> 01:32:48,666
When you saved us and took us
close, we felt a lot to cry brother.

1039
01:32:49,625 --> 01:32:52,833
We feel very courageous by
calling you brother.

1040
01:33:00,375 --> 01:33:01,791
Where are all the other children?

1041
01:33:04,375 --> 01:33:06,791
Kids have sensitive hearts.

1042
01:33:07,541 --> 01:33:13,250
Poor kids have undergone great
mental stress fearing their death.

1043
01:33:13,625 --> 01:33:15,625
We could save these kids.

1044
01:33:15,833 --> 01:33:20,750
No idea how many more kids are
still there, whom we couldn’t save.

1045
01:33:42,583 --> 01:33:45,625
Rascal, it wouldn’t take even a minute
to punch you and put to sleep.

1046
01:33:46,083 --> 01:33:48,125
You play with the children’s
lives, rascal?

1047
01:33:48,875 --> 01:33:54,083
Hey Bhimaa, what children? Playing with
their lives, what are you talking now?

1048
01:33:54,375 --> 01:33:57,541
You’re safe as there’s no proof.
But the day I get a proof,

1049
01:33:58,291 --> 01:34:00,333
I’ll squeeze you to death, rascal.

1050
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:03,625
You are after all an SI.
What’s your ego?

1051
01:34:03,833 --> 01:34:08,541
It will not take a minute for me to
use my power and get your dress off.

1052
01:34:08,750 --> 01:34:10,625
Do it, rascal.
Do it if you are so powerful.

1053
01:34:11,125 --> 01:34:13,750
You think I go silent if seniors say
and bend when I get suspended?

1054
01:34:14,083 --> 01:34:16,041
This shirt is just to control
the beast in me.

1055
01:34:16,291 --> 01:34:18,833
Once that is off, I’ll strip you
and beat up.

1056
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:24,875
You are still alive as I’m silent.
If I bring in my entire force…

1057
01:34:25,041 --> 01:34:26,458
Do it, rascal.
Why delay?

1058
01:34:26,833 --> 01:34:29,291
Bring in at a high rate or from
the neighbouring state.

1059
01:34:30,333 --> 01:34:35,708
Once I start slashing, even the graveyard
in this village will not be enough, rascal.

1060
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:44,833
Hey Bhavani, vacation time is over.
I’m giving you one final offer.

1061
01:34:45,625 --> 01:34:49,416
I’ll kill you after showing hell to you and
your son, which you showed to those kids.

1062
01:34:50,375 --> 01:34:52,083
No case and no charge sheet!

1063
01:35:29,875 --> 01:35:33,291
Damn! He has no time sense at all.
Bloody idiot!

1064
01:35:40,333 --> 01:35:41,083
Hey Rama!

1065
01:35:42,291 --> 01:35:44,458
Hey Rama idiot, stop.
Why do you leave when I’m calling?

1066
01:35:44,666 --> 01:35:45,583
Oh God!

1067
01:35:45,916 --> 01:35:47,458
Don’t you have the power to
Stop, when the girl loving you

1068
01:35:47,666 --> 01:35:49,041
is getting married in a week?

1069
01:35:49,833 --> 01:35:51,541
It is not enough that a man has
the moustache.

1070
01:35:51,708 --> 01:35:52,791
He also should have some courage.

1071
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,916
She said something like
peeing and all, the day before.

1072
01:35:56,375 --> 01:35:58,500
You don’t give different meanings
to a man daily and confuse me.

1073
01:35:58,708 --> 01:35:59,416
Leave me alone, Pari.

1074
01:35:59,625 --> 01:36:03,750
Is it? I left my entire family and
came with all my jewellery,

1075
01:36:04,166 --> 01:36:05,958
why do you ask me to leave?

1076
01:36:06,541 --> 01:36:08,625
-Jewellery?
-Come on, say. Say it!

1077
01:36:11,708 --> 01:36:14,208
Come Rama, let’s elope and
start a new life.

1078
01:36:15,083 --> 01:36:18,875
Present life itself is ruined and
will he have a new life again?

1079
01:36:19,083 --> 01:36:23,250
His life will get ruined, if he is by your
side and keep taking dips in the pond.

1080
01:36:23,458 --> 01:36:25,583
This crazy fool will get clever
only by eloping with him and

1081
01:36:25,791 --> 01:36:26,916
show him the outside world.

1082
01:36:27,125 --> 01:36:29,916
Outside world, Pari? I know no
other place than this village.

1083
01:36:30,125 --> 01:36:31,541
Oh God, you don’t need to know.

1084
01:36:31,750 --> 01:36:32,833
It’s enough that the bus driver
knows the way.

1085
01:36:33,041 --> 01:36:34,583
You just show some courage
and let’s go now.

1086
01:36:34,791 --> 01:36:37,208
Is courage any sweet curd rice
to prepare, for him to know?

1087
01:36:37,458 --> 01:36:40,291
He didn’t have that from the childhood
and how will this fool get it now?

1088
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:43,166
Yup! As I’m here now!

1089
01:36:44,291 --> 01:36:45,125
Who is this fellow?

1090
01:36:45,583 --> 01:36:47,875
Who are you idiot, came like
a clove in the sweet?

1091
01:36:48,125 --> 01:36:52,000
I’m neither a clove in sweet or cardamom
in idly. I’m their childhood friend.

1092
01:36:52,375 --> 01:36:55,333
-Rama, didn’t you recognise
my face? -Who is this idiot?

1093
01:36:55,541 --> 01:36:58,458
Was that you, I broke the knee caps
while stealing coconut from the temple?

1094
01:36:58,625 --> 01:36:59,333
It’s him! Yes, him!

1095
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:03,000
Damn, I’m their childhood friend.
You too didn’t recognise me, Pari?

1096
01:37:03,458 --> 01:37:06,041
Who? Srinivasa Sharma?

1097
01:37:06,958 --> 01:37:07,916
Vishwanatha Sastry?

1098
01:37:08,958 --> 01:37:11,541
-Satish!
-Satish, yes!

1099
01:37:11,833 --> 01:37:12,833
-Satish?
-Yes!

1100
01:37:13,166 --> 01:37:15,083
He looked so bad like a dark
tamarind seed, right?

1101
01:37:15,458 --> 01:37:17,583
He looks the same bad now,
though he is gained some colour.

1102
01:37:17,791 --> 01:37:20,291
It is wrong to hold a man and
do body shaming like this.

1103
01:37:20,666 --> 01:37:23,666
Pari, do you remember us eating
peanut snacks sitting in the last bench

1104
01:37:23,875 --> 01:37:25,458
while master was teaching at
the school.

1105
01:37:25,750 --> 01:37:29,500
-Yes, he told it correctly.
-Every mischievous student does the same.

1106
01:37:29,750 --> 01:37:33,875
Pari, I feel this idiot is cheating us.
He has no similarities to that Satish.

1107
01:37:34,250 --> 01:37:35,500
Do you still doubt me, Pari?

1108
01:37:35,708 --> 01:37:38,083
You remember, I complained about
him being coward in the childhood?

1109
01:37:38,291 --> 01:37:42,250
Yes Satish!
You changed so much.

1110
01:37:42,416 --> 01:37:44,625
Yes, but you haven’t changed at all.
You look the same beautiful. Staffed nose fellow!

1111
01:37:45,958 --> 01:37:48,291
But Rama is still the same coward.

1112
01:37:48,500 --> 01:37:51,166
You can’t still be like that, Rama.
You got to show courage, and jump Rama.

1113
01:37:51,375 --> 01:37:52,750
What to jump, when there’s
a pet on the other side?

1114
01:37:52,958 --> 01:37:54,000
I’ve got nothing right at my
native place and will have to beg

1115
01:37:54,208 --> 01:37:54,958
if I go to some other village.

1116
01:37:55,125 --> 01:37:58,458
Yup! Friendship isn’t dirt,
but friendship means the humans.

1117
01:37:58,625 --> 01:38:00,333
When I’m here,
will I let you beg Rama?

1118
01:38:00,625 --> 01:38:02,000
Will you beg instead of them?

1119
01:38:02,208 --> 01:38:04,958
My foot! I meant, I will get their
marriage done and get him a post as

1120
01:38:05,166 --> 01:38:06,958
priest in a big temple.

1121
01:38:07,583 --> 01:38:09,958
Who knows if he gets a priest job
or dump us suddenly.

1122
01:38:10,916 --> 01:38:12,208
Agree, Rama!

1123
01:38:13,625 --> 01:38:16,541
You can enter the temple, marry me
and also make me pregnant.

1124
01:38:16,708 --> 01:38:18,541
Pari is fast at everything from
childhood.

1125
01:38:18,791 --> 01:38:21,041
-Her mom isn’t so.
-Her dad is so, right?

1126
01:38:21,291 --> 01:38:24,166
-Hey Rama!
-Pari, what are those dirty deeds?

1127
01:38:24,375 --> 01:38:25,750
-I’ll get you both married.
-Go on!

1128
01:38:25,958 --> 01:38:26,916
-She is your responsibility now.
-Sure!

1129
01:38:27,125 --> 01:38:29,041
-Hey Pari, move. Come here.
-Ask! Pull her.

1130
01:38:29,250 --> 01:38:31,791
-Aren’t you ashamed of eloping
from home? -She is not.

1131
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,416
Didn’t I say not to be with
this idiot from childhood?

1132
01:38:34,625 --> 01:38:35,291
You’ve been saying.

1133
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:37,125
Will you marry him and live by
cleaning the temple steps?

1134
01:38:37,333 --> 01:38:38,041
That will be the future.

1135
01:38:38,250 --> 01:38:40,166
Look, his brother and father
were so very egoistic.

1136
01:38:40,333 --> 01:38:42,583
Thus, God turned him
fit for nothing.

1137
01:38:42,791 --> 01:38:44,916
I’ll get you married to this
Bhattachari tomorrow morning

1138
01:38:45,125 --> 01:38:46,583
and get you locked in his house.

1139
01:38:46,791 --> 01:38:48,583
-Bless me, father in law.
-Move now!

1140
01:38:48,791 --> 01:38:50,875
-Marriage won’t take place if
you are here. -Hey Rama!

1141
01:39:04,250 --> 01:39:06,833
-Tell me, Pari.
-Tomorrow is my wedding.

1142
01:39:08,750 --> 01:39:13,416
If you don’t come and take me
tonight, I’ll drink poison and die.

1143
01:39:16,916 --> 01:39:20,375
You are to eat with me at our wedding,
but you will have to do my final rites then.

1144
01:39:24,916 --> 01:39:26,041
What will you do now?

1145
01:39:26,583 --> 01:39:30,083
If there’s anyone who loves me
in this world, that’s just Pari.

1146
01:39:31,083 --> 01:39:34,625
-I’ll do anything for her, uncle.
-That’s the power of love, Rama.

1147
01:39:34,833 --> 01:39:37,125
Just tighten your dress and
jump into the arena.

1148
01:39:45,541 --> 01:39:48,500
If I had shown the same courage
then, I’d have been in

1149
01:39:48,708 --> 01:39:50,500
your father in law’s place now.

1150
01:39:51,875 --> 01:39:53,916
Pari!
Pari!

1151
01:39:54,833 --> 01:39:58,458
Call more silently, poor mosquitoes
might get disturbed.

1152
01:39:58,791 --> 01:40:02,458
-Pari!
*Damn! You must make a call, idiot.

1153
01:40:02,583 --> 01:40:03,625
Fine, call.

1154
01:40:03,833 --> 01:40:07,916
(Reciting a sloka)
Who is it?

1155
01:40:09,500 --> 01:40:11,833
Uncle, I’m Pari’s friend Poori.

1156
01:40:12,208 --> 01:40:14,541
-Are you Pari’s friend?
-Yes, uncle.

1157
01:40:14,875 --> 01:40:17,500
You idiot, Rama is the only
friend of Pari.

1158
01:40:19,125 --> 01:40:21,250
You should’ve called from
an STD booth.

1159
01:40:21,458 --> 01:40:23,916
-Your number is displayed here,
you fool. -Oh no!

1160
01:40:25,625 --> 01:40:26,583
Call on the landline.

1161
01:40:31,291 --> 01:40:33,708
Hello!
Hello, who is it?

1162
01:40:34,208 --> 01:40:38,083
(Song playing)

1163
01:40:38,500 --> 01:40:39,833
Who is it?
Please talk.

1164
01:40:40,625 --> 01:40:42,125
Why don’t you answer when
she’s asking, Sarangi?

1165
01:40:42,916 --> 01:40:44,916
Saranagi!
Who is that?

1166
01:40:45,625 --> 01:40:48,583
Doesn’t she at least know there’s
a person named Sarangi?

1167
01:40:48,791 --> 01:40:51,625
Hey Sarangi idiot, is it you
giving me a blank call daily?

1168
01:40:52,458 --> 01:40:56,291
Are you flirting with aunties,
you donkey? Cut the call now.

1169
01:40:57,875 --> 01:41:01,208
Idiot, why are you doing these dirty
deeds now instead of doing in the youth?

1170
01:41:01,416 --> 01:41:05,375
Love is in no way related to the age.
It is linked only with the mileage.

1171
01:41:05,791 --> 01:41:07,333
Such quotations are looked up
only in old age, like you.

1172
01:41:07,541 --> 01:41:09,166
What have you done being in
young age?

1173
01:41:10,166 --> 01:41:12,541
Let me know what should I do now.

1174
01:41:13,166 --> 01:41:16,541
Uncle and aunty will be in the hall
and you go from back side.

1175
01:41:16,750 --> 01:41:20,583
-Through kitchen!
-Ok! -Come!

1176
01:41:20,791 --> 01:41:22,666
I too waited to see you
displaying this courage.

1177
01:41:23,291 --> 01:41:25,125
Uncle, be careful!
We’ll go now.

1178
01:41:27,500 --> 01:41:31,791
You called me uncle from childhood,
though we have no blood relation.

1179
01:41:32,583 --> 01:41:35,458
I feel sad now when you are
leaving, dear.

1180
01:41:36,208 --> 01:41:37,500
Fine, get in.

1181
01:41:42,458 --> 01:41:45,166
-Take care!
-Aren’t you coming?

1182
01:41:46,208 --> 01:41:48,250
I’ll be here accompanying
my Mandaram.

1183
01:41:48,791 --> 01:41:50,375
May you get incoming calls soon!

1184
01:41:50,583 --> 01:41:51,916
-May that happen!
-Stop giving missed calls.

1185
01:41:52,833 --> 01:41:54,750
-Where are you taking us?
-We’re going to a safe place.

1186
01:41:55,083 --> 01:41:56,291
To a close relative of yours!

1187
01:41:56,625 --> 01:41:59,875
All my relatives left me as a kid.
Who is that relative I don’t know?

1188
01:42:00,083 --> 01:42:02,416
Oh no, he says safe place right?
You be quiet.

1189
01:42:02,625 --> 01:42:04,708
What are you waiting for?
Change the gear and drive.

1190
01:42:04,875 --> 01:42:07,250
-That’s the matter.
-Bye Sarangi! Go on!

1191
01:42:39,125 --> 01:42:40,541
Pari, where did he go?

1192
01:42:42,041 --> 01:42:44,333
There is some powerful temple
in this village, it seems.

1193
01:42:45,208 --> 01:42:47,333
He left to make arrangements
for our marriage there.

1194
01:42:47,625 --> 01:42:49,166
He forgot even his phone in
that hurry.

1195
01:42:50,125 --> 01:42:54,250
Pari, we came to this new village
believing in this idiot as you hurried us.

1196
01:42:55,041 --> 01:42:58,666
-Think once if we’re doing the right
thing or not. -Rama!

1197
01:43:02,666 --> 01:43:05,000
Why don’t answer the call though
I called you so many times, Boss?

1198
01:43:05,208 --> 01:43:09,250
Police came to know that we cheated
that SLN bus owner and took ten lakhs.

1199
01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:13,083
They are all searching for us.
We escaped. You go underground.

1200
01:43:13,500 --> 01:43:15,916
Fine, boss! Be careful! See you.

1201
01:43:19,333 --> 01:43:24,000
Who are you, idiot? You’re doing all
this to steal our jewellery, right?

1202
01:43:24,375 --> 01:43:27,708
Rama, I’m your friend Satish.
Tell him, Pari.

1203
01:43:28,166 --> 01:43:32,125
Don’t lie. You know it is a grave
sin to cheat a pure Brahmin.

1204
01:43:32,666 --> 01:43:34,250
You do such a brutal thing
for money?

1205
01:43:35,458 --> 01:43:40,166
Yes! I agree that I once lived
just for money.

1206
01:43:41,875 --> 01:43:44,166
But for the first time,
I’m doing this with humanity.

1207
01:43:44,583 --> 01:43:46,500
You’ve cheated us and again
saying some cock and bull stories.

1208
01:43:46,708 --> 01:43:47,916
I haven’t cheated you, Rama.

1209
01:43:48,166 --> 01:43:49,916
I brought you to those related
to you.

1210
01:43:50,291 --> 01:43:51,458
I have none in this world.

1211
01:43:51,666 --> 01:43:52,916
But you are his world.

1212
01:43:53,541 --> 01:43:54,750
Whom are you talking about?

1213
01:43:56,500 --> 01:43:57,708
It is not about him, right?

1214
01:44:01,291 --> 01:44:02,250
Yes, it is about that Bhimaa...

1215
01:44:03,708 --> 01:44:07,041
Who lost love from his childhood

1216
01:44:07,250 --> 01:44:08,291
and who is treated as God by
hundreds of people!

1217
01:44:09,833 --> 01:44:11,666
I brought you, as the work he
wanted to do is possible

1218
01:44:11,875 --> 01:44:13,875
in this whole planet, just by you.

1219
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,166
Sir, the children you saved
are orphans.

1220
01:44:19,791 --> 01:44:22,833
They have no any identity and
thus complaint wasn’t filed.

1221
01:44:24,333 --> 01:44:26,291
When we tracked this cell phone
you gave, we came to know

1222
01:44:26,500 --> 01:44:27,500
it belongs to Bhavani’s aide.

1223
01:44:27,708 --> 01:44:29,833
He had called Tandav’s men.

1224
01:44:35,875 --> 01:44:37,708
Tandav is the right hand man
of Bhavani.

1225
01:44:40,833 --> 01:44:45,000
Any person crossing the tides to catch him
hasn’t returned with head over the body.

1226
01:44:46,375 --> 01:44:48,291
He is a demon in the human
form, sir.

1227
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:52,083
He transports anything ranging
from spices to girls.

1228
01:44:52,583 --> 01:44:56,041
We didn’t get the permission for
a raid due to his political connections.

1229
01:44:56,833 --> 01:45:01,166
Tandava brought a few foreigners by
force and put them on Rudra’s boat.

1230
01:45:12,791 --> 01:45:14,666
It seems, Rudra is coming to
the village in two days.

1231
01:45:33,458 --> 01:45:38,958
Hey Bhimaa, come out. You overacted
a lot all these days, as I wasn’t here.

1232
01:45:39,625 --> 01:45:41,875
I’ve killed her husband.

1233
01:45:48,208 --> 01:45:49,041
Come!

1234
01:45:59,791 --> 01:46:03,791
Manliness is not in defaming
a woman, but it lies in upholding her.

1235
01:46:07,916 --> 01:46:12,250
God created the woman as a man
cannot tolerate delivery pains.

1236
01:46:13,541 --> 01:46:15,750
Thus, we shouldn’t give them
any pain.

1237
01:46:17,916 --> 01:46:22,250
If we give more suffering to the mother
earth bearing us, result is an earth quake.

1238
01:47:31,708 --> 01:47:35,000
-Hey, push everybody in.
-Why, it is a waste of food.

1239
01:47:35,208 --> 01:47:36,041
True!

1240
01:47:36,458 --> 01:47:40,000
-Hey! -I understood, sir.
I’ll take everyone to hospital.

1241
01:47:40,208 --> 01:47:41,291
-Mani!
-Sir!

1242
01:47:41,583 --> 01:47:43,916
-Take Nandini home safely.
-Yes, sir!

1243
01:47:47,375 --> 01:47:50,625
Tell your wretched headman that
his son is safe with me.

1244
01:48:02,416 --> 01:48:03,791
Why did you bring me here?

1245
01:48:16,875 --> 01:48:18,166
Oh no!

1246
01:48:27,416 --> 01:48:29,250
-Oh no!
-Bhimaa, what happened?

1247
01:48:29,916 --> 01:48:31,916
-My shirt is torn.
-Remove that shirt first.

1248
01:48:32,125 --> 01:48:33,291
Hey, what are you saying?

1249
01:48:33,500 --> 01:48:35,125
You shouldn’t be in a torn shirt.

1250
01:48:35,375 --> 01:48:36,666
No problem if it is torn.
Leave it.

1251
01:48:36,875 --> 01:48:38,666
That is a bad omen, Bhimaa.

1252
01:48:38,875 --> 01:48:41,500
-I don’t believe it. -I’m saying
it is bad omen. Remove that shirt.

1253
01:48:41,708 --> 01:48:43,458
They’d think I’m a mad fellow,
if I remove my shirt and stand.

1254
01:48:43,625 --> 01:48:46,833
-I don’t even have another shirt.
-I’ll bring something, wait. -Vidya!

1255
01:48:47,083 --> 01:48:48,291
Huh, why is this so?

1256
01:48:50,125 --> 01:48:51,125
This isn’t good.

1257
01:48:51,458 --> 01:48:54,333
Yes, perfect!
Wear this.

1258
01:48:54,583 --> 01:48:57,208
-Fine, turn that side.
-Huh! Ok!

1259
01:49:19,666 --> 01:49:23,333
What boss, you are into a good
romantic mood?

1260
01:49:24,375 --> 01:49:26,083
But, I’m still in tension.

1261
01:49:26,291 --> 01:49:28,875
Then, I’ll tell you a story to
change your mood.

1262
01:49:29,208 --> 01:49:30,750
-Is it? -Yes!
-Tell me.

1263
01:49:32,750 --> 01:49:36,041
-Sky is the boy, like me.
-Ok!

1264
01:49:36,458 --> 01:49:38,958
The earth is a girl, like you.

1265
01:49:39,541 --> 01:49:42,291
As the both were in pain for
never being able to meet,

1266
01:49:42,625 --> 01:49:46,000
God couldn’t see that and
created that sea.

1267
01:49:47,833 --> 01:49:52,041
Sky and the sea always are seen
together when we see from far.

1268
01:49:52,958 --> 01:49:55,000
Thus, I brought you here.

1269
01:49:55,166 --> 01:49:57,791
Sir is saying great romantic stories.

1270
01:49:58,291 --> 01:50:02,166
Not just saying, similar to how
that sky hugs around the earth,

1271
01:50:02,458 --> 01:50:04,666
I too will hug you tight forever.

1272
01:50:05,750 --> 01:50:07,750
-Wow!
-I have a small wish. -What?

1273
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,125
-You must sleep on my chest.
-Ok!

1274
01:50:10,708 --> 01:50:13,375
Then, you shouldn’t listen to
anything else other than

1275
01:50:13,583 --> 01:50:15,416
my heartbeat and the sound
of this sea.

1276
01:50:16,625 --> 01:50:22,041
Nothing other than this cool sea breeze
and my warm breathe should touch you.

1277
01:50:23,666 --> 01:50:27,125
None other than those stars
should see us.

1278
01:50:32,708 --> 01:50:34,875
-That guy is watching us.
-Who?

1279
01:50:37,916 --> 01:50:38,583
Hey!

1280
01:50:38,791 --> 01:50:39,875
-Namaste Sir!
-Who are you, idiot?

1281
01:50:40,083 --> 01:50:41,791
-Oh no, Bhimaa!
-Why are you scared?

1282
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:42,916
-Sir!
-Did you steal anything?

1283
01:50:43,125 --> 01:50:46,041
No, sir.
Everyone is scared of Police, sir.

1284
01:50:48,916 --> 01:50:49,750
What is that?

1285
01:50:50,833 --> 01:50:52,625
-A plant, sir!
-Show it.

1286
01:50:55,416 --> 01:50:56,291
Mother plant!

1287
01:50:58,375 --> 01:50:59,583
Mother plant?

1288
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,375
-Where are you taking it?
-To Mr Ravindra Varma!

1289
01:51:03,833 --> 01:51:05,916
-Oh, to the master?
-Yes!

1290
01:51:06,250 --> 01:51:08,250
-Fine, go!
-This is a very rare plant.

1291
01:51:08,541 --> 01:51:12,041
-Where did you get it?
-This plant is found only in this forest.

1292
01:51:12,416 --> 01:51:15,833
Thus, I traced the place where
insects named salabhas land on

1293
01:51:16,041 --> 01:51:18,791
the no moon day and got these.

1294
01:51:19,291 --> 01:51:22,083
It is the time for master to
prepare medicine. I’ll go.

1295
01:51:22,250 --> 01:51:24,750
-Did master ask you to come at
this time? -Yes, madam.

1296
01:51:27,333 --> 01:51:28,416
Fine! Come Vidya!

1297
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,666
Master doesn't meet anybody
after Sunset, right?

1298
01:51:32,041 --> 01:51:32,500
Come!

1299
01:51:34,291 --> 01:51:36,875
-Wait, I’ll just be back.
-Fine, I too will come.

1300
01:51:37,125 --> 01:51:40,000
No, you stay back.
Rudra is here, right? I’ll just be back.

1301
01:51:40,208 --> 01:51:41,625
Listen to me.
Where are you going?

1302
01:51:41,875 --> 01:51:43,041
Wait, I’ll just be back.

1303
01:51:43,250 --> 01:51:44,833
-Fine, come back fast.
-Ok!

1304
01:52:03,250 --> 01:52:05,375
Does this temple have an entry
even from the back side?

1305
01:53:25,666 --> 01:53:29,041
Does this work?
Will she come back to life?

1306
01:53:29,416 --> 01:53:32,916
If you’d have known about me, you
wouldn’t have asked this question.

1307
01:53:33,083 --> 01:53:35,166
Ayurveda is that great?

1308
01:53:35,375 --> 01:53:39,541
Ayurveda is great of course.
But Ravindra Varma is greater.

1309
01:53:41,833 --> 01:53:45,166
If you do chemical changes to
the mother plant,

1310
01:53:45,333 --> 01:53:47,083
the base to all medicinal plants…

1311
01:53:47,375 --> 01:53:50,583
A medicine with the qualities of
Sanjivini mentioned in Charaka Samhita,

1312
01:53:50,791 --> 01:53:53,833
which can cure even the death,
can be prepared.

1313
01:53:54,791 --> 01:53:59,333
This is the great medicine, which only
this Ravindra Varma can prepare.

1314
01:53:59,541 --> 01:54:02,625
-But, why children?
-Children have the tender bodies.

1315
01:54:03,083 --> 01:54:07,791
They are less adulterated, possess
high immunity and are pure in form.

1316
01:54:08,416 --> 01:54:10,708
Thus, the outcome will be great.

1317
01:54:11,500 --> 01:54:12,500
Go on!

1318
01:55:48,333 --> 01:55:49,416
Hey!

1319
01:56:25,625 --> 01:56:26,625
Brother!

1320
01:56:33,625 --> 01:56:34,625
Brother!

1321
01:56:59,208 --> 01:57:01,791
-Come on, lift guys!
-Lift!

1322
01:57:38,750 --> 01:57:39,916
Bhimaa!

1323
01:58:01,041 --> 01:58:08,458
Hey, if you take even one step ahead,
she’ll face a horrible death.

1324
01:58:10,791 --> 01:58:15,250
If I pierce half inch in, her blood
gets frozen and

1325
01:58:15,500 --> 01:58:17,833
the tiny nerves will be splattered.

1326
01:58:18,708 --> 01:58:23,916
Then not the water,
but blood rolls out from the eyes.

1327
01:58:26,166 --> 01:58:30,416
Unable to bear that pain, she herself
would request me to kill her.

1328
01:58:33,458 --> 01:58:36,708
No power in this world can
save her.

1329
01:58:36,916 --> 01:58:38,250
Do you know the value of
a life, idiot?

1330
01:58:38,416 --> 01:58:44,541
As I know the value of life, I’m inventing
a great medicine that gives life.

1331
01:58:44,791 --> 01:58:47,625
You are not giving life.
You are killing the innocent people.

1332
01:58:47,833 --> 01:58:52,916
Will the great elephant stop walking,
as ants die coming under its feet?

1333
01:58:53,458 --> 01:58:58,250
Many weak lives as these are lost
while I’m advancing towards my goal.

1334
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:00,208
Let them be gone.

1335
01:59:00,416 --> 01:59:02,750
You are not any great elephant.
You are a fool with arrogance.

1336
01:59:02,958 --> 01:59:07,125
This is not foolishness.
It is my knowledge.

1337
01:59:07,916 --> 01:59:11,041
I’ll prepare Sanjivini and
win over death.

1338
01:59:11,416 --> 01:59:14,791
I’ll bring this world to my feet.

1339
01:59:15,833 --> 01:59:19,125
This Ravindra Varma is
the future God.

1340
01:59:19,583 --> 01:59:21,916
God doesn’t kill demons like this
for selfish reasons.

1341
01:59:22,125 --> 01:59:25,583
No God can give life to the dead.

1342
01:59:26,583 --> 01:59:29,791
I’m a greater wizard than that God.

1343
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,625
Mad idiot, what a wizard are you?

1344
01:59:33,041 --> 01:59:34,291
You are a mental patient.

1345
01:59:34,500 --> 01:59:37,083
Yes rascal, we are the patients.

1346
01:59:37,291 --> 01:59:40,458
You know what our medicine is?
Money!

1347
01:59:41,291 --> 01:59:49,375
As I can get eternity along with
money, I put in so many efforts.

1348
01:59:50,083 --> 01:59:54,041
Will you come and stop at
a time when I could get Billions?

1349
01:59:54,333 --> 01:59:58,333
I know you’ll kill them,
if I take a step ahead.

1350
01:59:59,666 --> 02:00:04,458
You too know I’d kill you, if I
take another step ahead after that.

1351
02:00:05,708 --> 02:00:09,791
Leave Vidya and the kids.
I’ll take one step back.

1352
02:00:10,166 --> 02:00:12,208
-Not enough!
-What do you need?

1353
02:00:14,166 --> 02:00:17,416
Your life!

1354
02:00:19,916 --> 02:00:24,333
If my life is useful to save these,
take it.

1355
02:00:28,583 --> 02:00:29,791
No Bhimaa!

1356
02:00:43,416 --> 02:00:44,458
Brother!

1357
02:00:56,750 --> 02:00:57,916
Bhimaa!

1358
02:01:04,666 --> 02:01:06,333
No!

1359
02:01:25,166 --> 02:01:26,333
No brother!

1360
02:01:35,458 --> 02:01:36,625
Bhimaa!

1361
02:01:40,833 --> 02:01:42,500
Hey Ravindra Varma!

1362
02:01:43,625 --> 02:01:45,583
If one more life is gone…

1363
02:01:46,458 --> 02:01:49,666
Or if one more drop of blood
from Vidya falls on the ground…

1364
02:01:50,375 --> 02:01:55,250
You rascal, I’ll come back again.

1365
02:02:01,291 --> 02:02:02,416
Beat me, idiot!

1366
02:02:06,125 --> 02:02:07,041
Brother!

1367
02:02:37,750 --> 02:02:39,666
Brother!

1368
02:02:55,666 --> 02:03:00,208
This body should be found.
How?

1369
02:03:00,500 --> 02:03:05,208
Both are dead in an accident.
Create it.

1370
02:03:09,958 --> 02:03:11,708
I have a small wish.

1371
02:03:11,916 --> 02:03:13,958
You must sleep on my chest.

1372
02:03:14,708 --> 02:03:17,791
Then, you shouldn’t listen to
anything else other than

1373
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:19,583
my heartbeat and the sound
of this sea.

1374
02:03:20,500 --> 02:03:25,416
Nothing other than this cool sea breeze
and my warm breathe should touch you.

1375
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:29,250
None other than those stars
should see us.

1376
02:03:36,500 --> 02:03:38,291
Hey, an accident!

1377
02:03:39,916 --> 02:03:41,791
None would know if we throw
these bodies into that

1378
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,250
burning bus and our job is done.

1379
02:03:45,291 --> 02:03:46,458
Ok!

1380
02:03:52,166 --> 02:03:54,791
SLN bus coming to Anantapur
from Mangalore met with

1381
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,416
a dreadful accident at
Anantapur ghat road.

1382
02:03:57,625 --> 02:04:00,500
Number 14, an orphan body!

1383
02:04:09,958 --> 02:04:11,208
Is Bhimaa dead?

1384
02:04:14,875 --> 02:04:15,708
Ramaa!

1385
02:04:17,375 --> 02:04:19,375
Bhimaa is dead.

1386
02:04:20,666 --> 02:04:22,875
I came to know about
your brother's greatness that day.

1387
02:04:35,041 --> 02:04:37,875
I asked his sprit to possess my body

1388
02:04:39,833 --> 02:04:43,791
to take revenge, in order to
fulfill his goal. But…

1389
02:04:46,083 --> 02:04:49,833
if I have to possess on any body,
he must be a person of my own family.

1390
02:04:50,583 --> 02:04:53,583
A guy born along with me is required.
Even though my body is ruined...

1391
02:04:53,791 --> 02:04:55,791
my blood is still flowing
in another guy.

1392
02:04:56,458 --> 02:05:00,750
My replica is still alive to take
my revenge.

1393
02:05:01,041 --> 02:05:03,375
It is Ramaa my younger brother.

1394
02:05:07,625 --> 02:05:09,625
Before my 10th day ritual is done,
Rama must remove the holy

1395
02:05:10,041 --> 02:05:12,958
rudraksh necklace from his neck
with his own hands

1396
02:05:13,833 --> 02:05:16,916
in the powerful Shiva temple
at Mahendragiri.

1397
02:05:17,625 --> 02:05:22,041
He should wholeheartedly
welcome my soul into his body.

1398
02:05:22,333 --> 02:05:25,291
You have to make him do that.

1399
02:05:33,333 --> 02:05:33,791
Hey!

1400
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:48,208
-No!
-Hey!

1401
02:05:56,291 --> 02:05:57,666
No, don't hit!

1402
02:05:58,333 --> 02:05:59,958
Is he still alive?

1403
02:06:03,375 --> 02:06:04,416
Rama!

1404
02:06:05,416 --> 02:06:06,625
No, don’t hit.

1405
02:06:07,125 --> 02:06:08,333
Rama!

1406
02:06:32,208 --> 02:06:33,583
This is not him.

1407
02:06:34,958 --> 02:06:37,125
Yes! He is not Bhimaa,
but his brother Rama.

1408
02:06:41,166 --> 02:06:43,583
How many days more will it
take to prepare Sanjivini?

1409
02:06:43,791 --> 02:06:49,083
You fool, poison arrived first even
when sea was churned for elixir.

1410
02:06:49,958 --> 02:06:53,875
It takes time for us to get
the elixir we need.

1411
02:06:55,083 --> 02:06:59,083
Hey, first kill these two and
throw them in sea.

1412
02:07:00,458 --> 02:07:01,416
Why?

1413
02:07:03,083 --> 02:07:08,333
We did experiments on kids so far.
Let’s now do on these both.

1414
02:07:10,250 --> 02:07:12,833
Throw all of them after that,
in the sea.

1415
02:07:18,500 --> 02:07:20,208
No!

1416
02:07:23,916 --> 02:07:26,791
I’m not asking to call in a fear
of losing life.

1417
02:07:28,791 --> 02:07:33,291
I’m asking with a wish to
save lives.

1418
02:07:35,250 --> 02:07:36,291
Just for once…

1419
02:07:38,500 --> 02:07:42,375
Remove that rudraksh necklace
for once and call Bhimaa.

1420
02:07:44,250 --> 02:07:47,666
He’d be somewhere around here
waiting for your call.

1421
02:07:50,375 --> 02:07:53,833
Your brother’s blood seeped
into this same ground.

1422
02:07:58,833 --> 02:08:00,583
One thing is true, Rama.

1423
02:08:02,958 --> 02:08:07,541
What they are doing is brutality
by killing those children.

1424
02:08:09,916 --> 02:08:15,375
But being silent even when there’s
a chance to save, is a sin.

1425
02:08:16,500 --> 02:08:19,000
It is a sin, which even your blood
can’t cleanse.

1426
02:08:21,916 --> 02:08:24,250
-Brother!
-Look there.

1427
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:27,791
Brother!

1428
02:08:29,291 --> 02:08:36,500
That kid is calling you as brother.
Not as Rama, but as Bhimaa.

1429
02:08:37,833 --> 02:08:40,416
You say Bhima is a monster, right?

1430
02:08:41,458 --> 02:08:45,416
When it is the killing time,
even God kills like a monster.

1431
02:08:48,750 --> 02:08:53,916
It is a monster if killed for ego
and a God when killed for virtue.

1432
02:08:54,958 --> 02:08:56,458
You decide it now.

1433
02:08:57,458 --> 02:09:03,916
Is the hatred you grew on Bhimaa is great
or the confidence those kids grew is great.

1434
02:09:05,541 --> 02:09:09,166
Bhimaa, that relation brings
you anger.

1435
02:09:09,375 --> 02:09:10,375
Get lost!

1436
02:09:11,833 --> 02:09:13,875
You hate even to listen to
that name.

1437
02:09:13,958 --> 02:09:15,250
Bhimaa!

1438
02:09:16,791 --> 02:09:19,041
But now, that name is
the shield for us.

1439
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,458
That name is the weapon
punishing these.

1440
02:09:27,375 --> 02:09:28,291
Bhimaa!

1441
02:09:29,291 --> 02:09:30,125
Bhimaa!

1442
02:09:30,791 --> 02:09:31,625
Bhimaa!

1443
02:09:34,500 --> 02:09:39,791
-Hey Rama, call me once as brother.
-Get lost!

1444
02:09:42,041 --> 02:09:43,791
The one who was born In bruguvamsa

1445
02:09:44,666 --> 02:09:46,791
Born in Sravana nakshatra (star)!

1446
02:09:47,625 --> 02:09:49,166
Born in Vasishta kula gotra!

1447
02:09:50,083 --> 02:09:51,875
Son of Sankara Bhagavathula!

1448
02:09:52,708 --> 02:09:54,958
I, named Ramachandra!

1449
02:09:57,250 --> 02:09:59,166
Whole heartedly!

1450
02:10:00,791 --> 02:10:02,291
Am calling with love!

1451
02:10:03,208 --> 02:10:04,541
My brother Bhimaa!

1452
02:10:06,250 --> 02:10:07,250
Come!

1453
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,458
Greed, unsatisfied even after
having the Kingdom!

1454
02:11:24,791 --> 02:11:26,958
Ego overtaking the virtue!

1455
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,416
Every time these show up!

1456
02:11:32,625 --> 02:11:35,416
The roaring axe comes to life.

1457
02:11:36,500 --> 02:11:40,625
I got a good because of
your cruelty.

1458
02:11:41,250 --> 02:11:46,416
For the first time my brother
Rama called me as brother.

1459
02:11:46,791 --> 02:11:50,458
Yeah, my heart is full of joy.

1460
02:11:51,625 --> 02:11:57,833
I’ll present you with a celebration
for this happiness you presented me.

1461
02:11:58,791 --> 02:12:00,541
I’ll present you the celebration
of death.

1462
02:13:47,708 --> 02:13:49,500
This is an eightfold capture.

1463
02:14:03,291 --> 02:14:07,500
I killed so many innocent kids…

1464
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:13,416
Don’t I know how many spirits would
be waiting to take a revenge on me?

1465
02:14:14,625 --> 02:14:15,791
Come!

1466
02:14:22,666 --> 02:14:27,291
Demons, spirits or the ghosts
can’t cross this protection shield.

1467
02:14:28,416 --> 02:14:32,041
I’m the God to be in future.

1468
02:14:35,125 --> 02:14:39,416
It is not possible for you to
face me.

1469
02:14:49,416 --> 02:14:51,166
Whenever and wherever
the virtue…

1470
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:53,791
is offended, hey son of Bharatha!

1471
02:14:54,916 --> 02:14:56,833
And the injustice rises high!

1472
02:14:58,375 --> 02:15:00,333
My arrival is affirmative.

1473
02:15:01,500 --> 02:15:03,583
Will the God arrive?

1474
02:15:04,750 --> 02:15:06,666
What ages are you in?

1475
02:15:07,708 --> 02:15:10,583
Will he come like Lord Vishnu
who arrived in Gajendra Moksha?

1476
02:15:12,791 --> 02:15:15,750
Will he come like Lord Narasimha
coming out by breaking the pillar

1477
02:15:15,958 --> 02:15:17,916
when Prahlada called?

1478
02:15:19,916 --> 02:15:23,166
Will he come like Lord Shiva,
who came for Markandeya?

1479
02:15:24,291 --> 02:15:28,000
Call for him, let’s see how
he comes. Call for him.

1480
02:15:31,291 --> 02:15:35,875
That Ravanasura who tried lifting
Lord Shiva along with Kailasa!

1481
02:15:38,416 --> 02:15:41,541
was easily captured by
Kartaveeryarjuna in his finger snap!

1482
02:15:44,166 --> 02:15:49,416
Parasurama who chopped such great
Kartaveeryarjuna into pieces, will arrive.

1483
02:18:17,125 --> 02:18:20,166
Sanjivini was found to Anjaneya
for the good of this world.

1484
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,041
But will never come into the habds
of a mean guy like you.

1485
02:18:23,958 --> 02:18:26,750
You can just find your death in
my hands.

1486
02:18:28,208 --> 02:18:33,416
You were proud saying to be future God
and to bring the world to your feet.

1487
02:18:34,916 --> 02:18:39,875
I’ll split open your nerves and show
you the hell before you die.

1488
02:19:18,208 --> 02:19:21,666
Though born from the same womb,
we both never took the same path.

1489
02:19:22,416 --> 02:19:25,041
I misunderstood your love
because of my ignorance.

1490
02:19:26,250 --> 02:19:27,500
Please, forgive me.

1491
02:19:27,666 --> 02:19:31,625
I wish to relive the moments
we missed from the childhood.

1492
02:19:33,958 --> 02:19:37,541
Oh no! Oh no!
No!

1493
02:19:38,291 --> 02:19:40,791
-Rama, you got a baby boy.
-Is it?

1494
02:19:41,583 --> 02:19:43,250
What will you name him?

1495
02:19:43,458 --> 02:19:44,458
Bhimaa!
