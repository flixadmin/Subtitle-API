2
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,010
Let go of me!

3
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,730
Let go of me!

4
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,640
Release me!

5
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,930
Let go of me!

6
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:44,400
It's confirmed, boss. He's our target.

7
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,190
No…

8
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,940
Ask him to text me
after transferring the money.

9
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,690
Where the hell is that guy?
Why isn't he here yet?

10
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,190
He will get us into trouble.

11
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:14,730
What happened, boss?

12
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,350
-Boss, my foot!
-Okay, boss.

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,680
Breaking news for our viewers!

15
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:55,810
What I'm about to share now
has never happened before in this area.

16
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,760
It's a rampage all around.

17
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:01,390
A hyena has been spotted here.

18
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:14,150
Saffron TV will give you
live updates by the minute.

19
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,980
People from the nearby villages
have gathered here.

20
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,980
We have no idea
what the hyena is going to do.

21
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,600
-Tell me, Joshy.
-Sathya, I'm trying to reach Parthiban.

22
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,350
His phone is not reachable. Where is he?

23
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,850
He must have gone
to drop Siddhu off at school.

24
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,640
Try calling Siddhu.
They both must be together.

25
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:41,060
If you talk to him,
please ask him to call me.

26
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,720
Handle this properly!

27
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,980
Place a barricade there! Hurry up!

28
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:45,900
-Kumar.
-Sir?

29
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:49,550
-What's the situation update?
-Sir, the hyena has caused havoc.

30
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,050
Sir, if this continues,

31
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,650
-many people will be injured.
-Is anyone coming?

32
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,020
They've sent two experts
from the Wild Life SOS team.

33
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,050
They've only handled cheetahs before,
not hyenas.

34
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,930
Nobody knows how to handle it.

35
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,600
Parthiban, we have a situation.
It's an emergency.

36
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,800
Can you come here?

37
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,300
I've sent you the photo
of the footprints. Check that.

38
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,440
The footprints are big.

39
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,690
It could be a spotted hyena.
They are extremely ferocious.

40
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,810
Okay. How soon can you get here?

41
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,470
Run!

42
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,190
Help!

43
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:44,900
Promise me, you won't tell your mom
that you were late for school today.

44
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,110
You promise me you won't tell mom

45
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,100
that I took my phone to school today.

46
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:55,860
Please, Dad!

47
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:10,430
The situation is totally
out of control, Parthiban.

48
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,550
Hyenas are social animals, Joshy.

49
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,260
They live in packs.

50
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,230
If a hyena is alone here,
either it has lost its way

51
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,940
or the rest of its clan is dead.
People will fear it and try to kill it.

52
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,480
But we have to capture it alive.

53
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,610
If we follow your advice,
we will become its prey.

54
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,180
Then how should we capture it?

55
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,400
The walkie-talkie, please.

56
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,800
Hey, Channel 3. We are on Channel 3.

57
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,980
Dad, I'll come along. I'll be helpful.

58
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,440
Stay in the car.

59
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,480
That'd be the most helpful
thing for me.

60
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,940
I am not in the mood
to get chided by your mom.

61
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,190
Okay?

62
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,110
Put up the barricades!

63
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,720
Push it here, quickly. Hurry up. Come on.

64
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:54,060
-Why did you place the barricades?
-The DFO's orders, sir.

65
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:56,610
What are you looking at? Do it now!

66
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,770
Sir, why did you place
the barricades here?

67
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,680
The animal could barge into the school.
It's very risky.

68
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:06,650
-Please--
-Ranger, do one thing.

69
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:10,260
I'll give you my uniform.
Do my job as well.

70
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,550
-Hey! What are you guys doing?
-Idiot!

71
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,470
-Place the barricade properly!
-Come in, Parthiban.

72
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:17,140
-Yeah, Joshy.
-They can't do a thing.

73
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,900
We'll have to handle the situation.

74
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,060
Get a tranquilizer from the sanctuary.

75
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,850
I'll tell you when to fire
and from where.

76
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:23,970
Yes, okay.

77
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,560
Catch it!

78
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,400
It's scared. It's looking
for a place to hide.

79
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,860
They don't understand it.
They are trying to kill it.

80
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,720
If this continues,
the hyena will enter the school.

81
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:40,480
Bring the tranquilizer
to the west end of the school.

82
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:41,980
Help!

83
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,430
Help…

84
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,860
Kids, get inside!

85
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,020
No one should be outside! Go!

86
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,900
I said get inside!

87
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,060
Students,
go to your classrooms immediately.

88
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:05,900
It's an emergency! Teachers and staff!

89
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,900
Please take all the kids
safely to the classroom.

90
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,400
There is no time! Hurry up!

91
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:16,100
-Get in!
-Hurry up!

92
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,050
Get in!

93
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,010
I got permission for a tranquilizer gun.
I'm taking it.

94
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:35,810
Run!

95
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,470
Move!

96
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,220
Come in, Parthiban.

97
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,480
I'm in position.

98
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,440
Joshy, wait!

99
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,270
Don't aim at its neck
like we usually do.

100
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,020
Its striking force will be as heavy
as its pitch of laughter.

101
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,140
Aim for the lungs!

102
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:37,760
Shoot.

103
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,600
-Hang on.
-This is the perfect time. Shoot, Joshy.

104
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,020
The gun is jammed, Parthiban.

105
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,230
A gun can't adapt
to the situation and operate.

106
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,860
It's a machine.
You need to service it every month.

107
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:57,970
-Siddhu?
-Dad.

108
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,110
Get your spear.

109
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,760
-Give your shoelace to Joshy.
-Okay, Dad.

110
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,010
-Don't go out!
-Run!

111
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,600
Watch out!

112
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,760
You heard your dad, right?

113
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,020
Give me your shoelaces.

114
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,760
-Uncle, give the javelin to me.
-Why?

115
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,760
-Get inside!
-Let's go!

116
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,800
Parthiban, the spear
you asked for is ready.

117
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:38,800
-Tell my dad that I'm throwing it.
-Parthiban, here it comes!

118
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,730
Hey, come on, move!

119
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,440
-Move.
-Move!

120
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,980
Who is that man?

121
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,350
His name is Parthiban.

122
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:55,890
He's from Chennai.

123
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,550
He's an animal rescuer.

124
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,690
He runs a coffee shop nearby.

125
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,020
-Hey!
-Move!

126
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,560
-Go inside.
-Yes, sir.

127
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:05,940
All right…

128
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,470
-Come on, move!
-Let's go.

129
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:10,810
-Move!
-Quiet!

130
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,390
Ask the questions in order.
The DFO will answer you.

131
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,430
Look, whatever happened
is not out of the ordinary.

132
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,900
It is our daily job.

133
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,810
Animals migrate
in search of food and water…

134
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:24,430
The DFO will give us some
exclusive news. Come on.

135
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,230
There's no point in asking them anything.
They didn't do anything.

136
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:30,650
A middle-aged man in a white shirt.

137
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:33,850
Find him. You'll get
the real information from him.

138
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,150
That'd be exclusive.

139
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,690
-White shirt, middle-aged man?
-Yes.

140
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:38,480
Where do I find him in this crowd?

141
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,190
Thalapathy

142
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,440
His entry spells power

143
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,110
Who is our brother? Thalapathy!

144
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,810
You wanted a shirt urgently.

145
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,470
-What happened, sir?
-Get it stitched.

146
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,940
-What's this? There is blood on it!
-Stitch it.

147
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:26,140
My life is in this town

148
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,560
And I ain't going down

149
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,300
You think that I'm crazy

150
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,430
But I don't want the crown

151
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,810
My life is in this town

152
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,470
And I ain't going down

153
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,900
You think that I'm crazy

154
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,860
But I don't want the crown

155
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:46,300
I'm just an ordinary person

156
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,480
Yeah!

157
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,560
I'm just a peace-loving soul

158
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:55,940
I'm just an ordinary person

159
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,060
Yeah!

160
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,050
I'm just a peace-loving soul

161
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,310
Hi, Chief.

162
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,140
-Morning.
-Morning, sir.

163
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,940
…is in this town

164
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:16,980
Hi, Thalapathy!

165
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:23,650
My life is in this town

166
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:26,470
And I ain't going down…

167
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,550
Why is this not heating up?

168
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:32,550
Some problem with the thermostat, sir.
I've called the service team.

169
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,360
They'll be here today.

170
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,100
-The cakes are ready for delivery.
-Okay.

171
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,300
Should I ship them?

172
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,060
-Good morning, sir.
-Good morning.

173
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,890
Just an ordinary person

174
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,260
Yeah!

175
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:48,140
I'm just a peace-loving soul

176
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:53,180
I'm just an ordinary person

177
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,220
Yeah, I'm just a…

178
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:58,400
Sir, this shirt is ripped badly.
It can't be stitched.

179
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,010
Do you know which shop
my wife bought this from?

180
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,600
-I don't know.
-I'm in trouble.

181
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:10,270
Hey, what's going on?
How did the police get our photos?

182
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:12,430
They're looking for us
at every checkpoint.

183
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,690
The man who told us to kill
the collector betrayed us.

184
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,690
He's the one
who leaked our photos.

185
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:20,860
Don't go out for a week. Hide yourself.

186
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:24,100
Please don't get caught.
I'll do something. Stay hidden.

187
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,850
Hey, we have no money!
We have to get out of here!

188
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,560
We have no clue where we are
and what is happening.

189
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,890
We trusted you and came here,
and you're bossing us around?!

190
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,860
We can't go anywhere
without money.

191
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,860
Do something, and send us money!

192
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,510
Please understand the situation.

193
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,180
The police have become alert
because of the collector's death.

194
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:43,190
It'll take a week to get
the situation under control.

195
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,520
-Don't try to contact me until then.
-Hey!

196
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,600
You--

197
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,400
What are you looking at?
Eyes on the road!

198
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,230
-What happened, boss?
-What should I do with them?

199
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,720
In the early hours of yesterday morning,

200
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:09,800
some unknown men who broke
into the collector's guesthouse

201
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:13,480
-and throat-slit and brutally murdered…
-You didn't get ready yet?

202
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:16,020
Oh, you're mad about the shirt.

203
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:21,260
I-I spilled chocolate on it,
so I decided to wash it and changed…

204
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,430
I bought you that shirt,
especially, for our anniversary.

205
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,860
But you ruined that shirt
as well as my mood.

206
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:36,190
I have nothing to say to you now.

207
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,680
Now, my mood is not going to change

208
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,220
no matter what you do.

209
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,940
But the plan won't change.

210
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,260
I can also be mad.

211
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:10,550
Your breaths and my breaths

212
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:16,110
Are entangled now

213
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:21,690
I see you everywhere

214
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,860
This is your magic

215
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:33,260
Small moments of excitement

216
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:37,020
Shall we pick up the kids from school?

217
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,510
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

218
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,720
-Yes.
-Hi.

219
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:42,770
Yes, tell me.

220
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,680
Chintu-- No.

221
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:47,980
M-Mathi's mother is not well.

222
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,810
Siddharth's father is not well.

223
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,260
Her mom is missing her.

224
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:53,300
-Who are you?
-His mom.

225
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,520
Her dad.

226
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,050
My soul and your body

227
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:06,970
I see you everywhere…

228
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,690
-A small peg?
-No, I don't drink.

229
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:12,020
-Think of it as medicine.
-Really?

230
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,350
How do you drink this, sir?

231
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,180
Stay away from the cage.

232
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,430
We will be adopting this hyena.

233
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,310
What should we name it?

234
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,480
Elsa.

235
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,480
Ghost.

236
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,150
Hachiku.

237
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:47,190
I also have a name in mind,
but promise me you won't laugh.

238
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,400
How about "Chakadbangadu"?

239
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:06,110
You are my first wish

240
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,440
Look ahead!

241
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,260
DONATION BOX

242
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,650
You are with me at every step

243
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,600
You are unique

244
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,760
Don't be scared.

245
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,760
-Chintu, come here.
-No.

246
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,390
-Come on, it's okay.
-Okay, go.

247
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,440
Slowly.

248
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,760
Come from this side. Don't be scared.

249
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,600
Do you like him?

250
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,230
You are with me at every step
My heart is flying high like a kite

251
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:51,510
Open it quickly.

252
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:58,020
-Sir, you're not supposed to help.
-Please wait.

253
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,350
Go! Hurry!

254
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:01,860
Sir, no.

255
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,360
-Is the shop on the left or right?
-It's over there, boss.

256
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:22,940
How much is it?

257
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,350
Your shop is pretty empty.
When do customers usually come?

258
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,770
After 6:00 p.m.

259
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,650
-Thank you.
-You're welcome, sir.

260
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,760
I checked everything.

261
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:49,510
All of their chests are empty.
What do we do now?

262
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:51,360
We'll wait here until nightfall.

263
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,730
What? You want to cut my hair?

264
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:07,470
This idiot will be the death of me.

265
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:23,550
Everyone on the road was panic-stricken
and running around.

266
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:27,010
That's when the serial killer
stood in the middle of the road

267
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,800
and started shooting at everyone.

268
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,720
There was a pile of corpses
on the road.

269
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:33,930
He was notorious.
He was killing everyone.

270
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:41,180
At that time, a brave and bold
police officer got there

271
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:43,940
and fired at the serial killer.

272
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,680
The serial killer ran and hid somewhere.

273
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:49,060
When the police officer
was reloading his gun,

274
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:52,800
the serial killer fired at him.

275
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:53,800
Hey!

276
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:57,760
Then the wounded police officer
fell at your feet.

277
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:01,980
He fell at the place where
you were safely hiding behind the car.

278
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:06,810
Now, the police officer's gun
is in your hand

279
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:09,180
and you have a clean shot.

280
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,930
The serial killer doesn't know
that you are there,

281
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:19,730
but you can easily shoot him
from your position.

282
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:22,140
We only got Rs. 300.

283
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:23,730
And this phone.

284
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:25,970
Hey, go and find someone rich!

285
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:29,230
And you have an easy way out.

286
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:31,560
You can quietly escape from there.

287
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:35,860
What will you do then? Picture yourself.

288
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:37,850
I'll just sleep.

289
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:41,180
Oh! You'll sleep, I see!

290
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:45,930
-Siddhu, it's getting late. Go to bed.
-Wait, Mom. Just a few more minutes.

291
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:49,800
I'll take the easy way out
and bring in more police officers.

292
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:52,980
By then, the serial killer
will kill more innocent people.

293
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:14,010
I'll give the gun to the police officer

294
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,350
and say,
"Look, here's a clear shot. Fire."

295
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:23,430
The police officer is shit-scared.
How can he shoot?

296
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,520
Picture yourself.

297
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,860
Let go of me!

298
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:37,190
-Hey, what is the number?
-Help me!

299
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,360
She's a nuisance!

300
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,430
-Hello? Wait.
-Where are you, dear?

301
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,730
-Here.
-Hey.

302
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:46,230
Hey, tell us your ATM PIN,
or I'll kill you!

303
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:48,400
-Tell me.
-Why are the police here?

304
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,650
Hey, stop screaming!

305
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:52,550
No… please don't.

306
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,140
-I can't move. Help me.
-Tell us your ATM PIN.

307
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,860
-Your PIN.
-Let me go.

308
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:01,760
-The PIN.
-Please let me go! No!

309
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:05,680
Let me go! Don't do this!

310
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:07,610
Tell me the PIN.

311
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,980
Then I'll shoot him myself.

312
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:21,100
If you shoot him,
you'll also labeled a murderer.

313
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:23,640
It is against the law.

314
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:28,190
There is one more way.
Picture yourself.

315
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,050
Why did you shoot him?

316
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,440
Where did you get this gun?

317
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,020
-PIN!
-What?

318
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,600
PIN!

319
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,400
I don't know what else to do, Dad.

320
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,390
No matter what I do,
someone will be killed.

321
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,900
Either an innocent or a criminal.
So, it'd better be the criminal.

322
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:53,100
Siddhu, go. Go and sleep.
It's getting late.

323
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,190
Chintu, come.

324
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,060
Dad!

325
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,430
Dad!

326
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:41,050
The only option is to shoot him.

327
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:43,760
Who are you talking about?

328
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:46,890
The killer in the Picture Yourself story.

329
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,650
He's still thinking about that.

330
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,480
As I told you, if you shoot,
you'll be labeled a murderer.

331
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,730
You'll end up in jail. You won't even
get sleep. Are you okay with that?

332
00:26:55,810 --> 00:27:00,110
I won't be sent to jail. After all,
I will have saved innocent people.

333
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,010
If I'm lucky, I'll get a medal.

334
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:03,230
Ain't I smart?

335
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:06,510
Get in the car.

336
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,900
-What were you talking about?
-Nothing.

337
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,270
What time is the wedding?

338
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:13,180
We'll go there
after dropping Chintu off at school.

339
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:15,110
He couldn't even think
of the right answer.

340
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:17,100
And he's thinking
of becoming a writer!

341
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,680
Both of you, please sign here.

342
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,180
Congrats.

343
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:26,230
Are you guys witnesses?
Please come and sign this.

344
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:29,810
-Congratulations.
-Thank you so much.

345
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:31,800
See you later.

346
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,180
-Bye.
-Bye.

347
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:36,650
Hey, you can touch her
only after I say so. I'm kidding.

348
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,610
-Take good care of her.
-Yeah.

349
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:39,860
-Bye.
-Bye.

350
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:43,260
Where should I drop you off, ma'am?

351
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:46,220
I have some work in the record room.
So, I'll stay back.

352
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:50,360
Do you want to say anything?

353
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:54,430
Stop telling my kids
such rubbish stories!

354
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,610
-Why? What happened?
-Give me your phone.

355
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:02,180
Check the browser history.

356
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,270
Browser history? Mine or his?

357
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:07,600
-His, of course.
-Oh!

358
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,610
"How to hunt? How to kill a deer?

359
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,190
How to kill a hyena?

360
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:16,860
-How to get successful in life--"
-Is this a joke?

361
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,640
No, I'm just reading it.

362
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,810
Who taught him all this?
You, right?

363
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:23,180
Okay, I'll ensure
this doesn't happen again.

364
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:25,560
-You'd better!
-Okay.

365
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,190
Great horned owl, Joshy.

366
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:38,480
They're becoming extinct.

367
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,050
Where did you find this?

368
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,100
Sir, this owl is from Australia.
I know everything.

369
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:47,440
-He's lying, sir.
-I'll slap you!

370
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:50,810
Since when have you been doing this?
How many more of them do you have?

371
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:53,510
Just this one, sir.
I hit it with my slingshot.

372
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,550
It fell unconscious with a thud.

373
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:59,020
Joshy, inform Blue Cross.
It needs immediate treatment.

374
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,640
Ask our veterinary doctor
to come here right away.

375
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:03,650
He's no more.

376
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,680
-What?!
-Yeah, I forgot to tell you.

377
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:09,060
He died on the spot
in a car accident last night.

378
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:12,100
I think he lost control,
and his car fell into the valley.

379
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,300
Yeah?

380
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:17,800
What?

381
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:23,520
Okay, I'll be there. Yeah.

382
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,970
It was not a car accident.

383
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,060
It was a planned murder.

384
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,680
Murder? How come?

385
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:37,650
He was shot dead.
I just got the intel.

386
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:39,940
A murder in our town?!

387
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:42,510
Last week, when the collector died,

388
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:44,890
I thought it was a hit-and-run case.

389
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:48,360
But now, after the doctor's death,
I don't think it's a coincidence.

390
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:50,400
I don't get it, Joshy.

391
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,900
I've lived here
for the past 20 years.

392
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,940
I've never heard of anything like this.

393
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:57,470
Who could be openly
roaming around with a gun?

394
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,480
Parthiban, don't worry.
We'll take care of it.

395
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:02,760
I'll go and check.

396
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,310
Shall I come with you?

397
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:23,400
Last week, when the collector died,
I thought it was a hit-and-run case

398
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,060
But now, after the doctor's death,
I don't think it's a coincidence.

399
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:44,150
Dad, it's your turn.

400
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,890
Dad!

401
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,560
-Your turn.
-Okay.

402
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,150
Sir, I'm done for the day.
May I leave now?

403
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,860
Oh, stop teasing me!
I'm going to the hostel!

404
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:07,550
Go. He must be waiting for you.

405
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:20,110
My song is much better than yours.

406
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,150
I know a better song than this.

407
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,010
Do you want to listen to it?

408
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:29,810
First, look there.

409
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:36,310
The shop is closed, sir.

410
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,690
I want a chocolate coffee.

411
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:45,440
We're closed, sir.
Didn't you see the sign outside?

412
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,150
Make that two.

413
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:50,680
-The shop is closed, sir.
-Three.

414
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,600
Sir!

415
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,430
I've cleaned up everything.

416
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:59,650
Can I come an hour late tomorrow?
I need to go to the temple.

417
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,730
The shop is closed, sir.

418
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:03,690
Shruthi, leave now. Hurry up.

419
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,180
I'm talking to you.
Can't you hear me?

420
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:09,230
-I just--
-Shruthi, go. I'll tell him.

421
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:12,110
Hey, what are you doing?

422
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:13,720
Sir!

423
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:16,980
Sir!

424
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,220
Sir, calm down.

425
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:21,560
I'll get it.

426
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,940
Hey, he took the gun again!
Go and stop him!

427
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:42,150
Let go of me!

428
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:43,430
Sir…

429
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,220
I've brought all the cash I've got here.

430
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:49,690
If you want more,
I'll withdraw it and give you.

431
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:51,110
Let her go, please.

432
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,600
This is wrong.

433
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:56,150
Let her go. Please. I'm begging you.

434
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:57,890
Chocolate coffee.

435
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,720
Let me go.

436
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,360
Stay right here.

437
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:12,390
-Don't come out until I tell you to, okay?
-Sir!

438
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:16,010
Let go of me! Sir!

439
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,480
Boss, he is inside.

440
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:26,440
Go and close the gate!

441
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,190
Sir!

442
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,270
Save me, sir!

443
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,810
-Sir!
-Hey!

444
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:43,140
Did you forget what I told you?

445
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,600
Let go of me!

446
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,180
Sir!

447
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:53,310
Save me, sir!

448
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:56,100
Hey, our job is done. Let's go.

449
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:57,350
Hey!

450
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:00,890
-Come with me, or just die!
-Let go of me.

451
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:04,970
All three of them and the CCTVs here

452
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,650
have seen our faces.

453
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:10,310
If we don't want our faces
to be on the news tomorrow,

454
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:11,600
we have to finish them.

455
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,800
Let's have chocolate coffee. Sit.

456
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,680
Good boy!

457
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:22,350
Sir!

458
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:25,270
Hey, delete the CCTV footage.

459
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:38,360
Sir, save me!

460
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:40,230
Sir--

461
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,520
Sir!

462
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:05,800
Sir!

463
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,440
Help!

464
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,360
Help me!

465
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:14,760
Sir!

466
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:16,760
Save--

467
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:21,860
Hey!

468
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:30,060
Hey! Let go of him!

469
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:32,260
Sir!

470
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:49,640
Hey, hit him, not me!

471
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:50,690
Sir!

472
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:06,220
Hey!

473
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,140
Dad!

474
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:57,020
-Dad!
-Shruthi! Chintu!

475
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:01,860
Got your chocolate coffee?

476
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:08,310
-Dad!
-It's okay.

477
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,510
Sir!

478
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:31,610
Hey! Let go of him!

479
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:33,230
Or I'll stab her!

480
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:34,970
Sir!

481
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:38,980
Sir!

482
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:43,140
-Save me!
-Kill him.

483
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,770
Where are you going? Kill him!

484
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:27,300
Dad!

485
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,640
Dad!

486
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:24,930
Chintu!

487
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:26,800
Dad!

488
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:29,150
Dad!

489
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,470
Parthiban!

490
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,440
Parthiban.

491
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,690
Go to the hospital first.

492
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,770
It doesn't look like a clot.
No physical injuries.

493
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:18,150
But she is showing signs of PTSD.

494
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,480
This child is in shock.
She is bound to feel anxious.

495
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,050
But there's nothing to worry about.

496
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,600
I'll give her some medicine.

497
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:26,800
Take good care of her, okay?

498
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:28,150
Okay.

499
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:30,650
Parthiban.

500
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:35,980
Parthiban, whatever happened
was not your mistake.

501
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:39,230
Anyone in your place
would've done the same.

502
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:41,640
We will fight in the court.

503
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,470
I'll always be with you.

504
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:48,650
I'll take care of the children
until you get released.

505
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:53,440
-Don't worry. I'll handle--
-Sathya, I don't know what happened.

506
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:57,650
I saw him going…

507
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:00,360
toward Chintu.

508
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:02,760
And then…

509
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,220
all this happened.

510
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:08,430
-Sir, we can't wait any longer.
-May I go in?

511
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,720
Parthiban, the police officers
are waiting outside.

512
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:18,980
I've asked them to wait for some time.

513
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:22,610
-Joshy, is there no other way--
-Sathya, try to understand.

514
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,020
This is very serious.

515
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:27,390
Five people have been killed.

516
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:29,930
Even I can't do anything.

517
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:34,150
He'll remanded for 15 days.
We have to follow procedures.

518
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:37,180
We'll decide what to do
after he's produced in the court.

519
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:38,730
Don't panic, okay?

520
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:43,360
Parthiban, let's go.

521
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,970
Your honor, according
to the ballistic reports,

522
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,890
five bullets fired from the gun

523
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:03,550
penetrated the victims' foreheads
at point-blank range.

524
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,260
Not a single bullet was missed.

525
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:08,390
A person who has never handled
a gun before was able to fire

526
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,270
five bullets in a split second. How?

527
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:14,470
Sometimes, even trained police officers
struggle to shoot below the knee.

528
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:18,180
But this person's aim
was absolutely perfect.

529
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:22,440
Inspector Bhawar Jetha.

530
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:25,150
Compare Mr. Parthiban's shooting skills

531
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:28,190
with that of a few ordinary men.

532
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,810
And submit the court proper proof
backed with adequate explanation.

533
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,760
-Nazrat!
-Yes?

534
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:39,180
Go and stand over there.

535
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,600
-Hey, leave it!
-Shahid.

536
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:45,480
Sashikanth.

537
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:48,650
What are you doing?

538
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:50,900
Parthiban!

539
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:54,850
Parthiban!

540
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:56,980
Step forward.

541
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:39,650
-Kumar.
-Sir?

542
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:41,360
Give him the nine-mm rifle.

543
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:23,520
Only after I send

544
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:27,390
the man who killed my husband
and younger brother…

545
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:31,180
to his grave along with his family

546
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:35,720
will I allow the funeral rites
of my husband to be performed.

547
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:38,400
I take this vow!

548
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,270
This is my promise to both of them!

549
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:50,650
Don't cry. It's okay.

550
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:56,610
Parthiban, here!

551
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:59,440
Your action was just a general exception.
Don't worry.

552
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:02,850
Parthiban, the ones you killed
weren't good people.

553
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:06,050
They were all gangsters.
It will come under self-defense.

554
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:07,600
Okay? Don't worry!

555
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:09,720
We'll handle it. Okay?

556
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:11,650
Take care of Chintu.

557
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:14,470
Your Honor, a few days ago,
when a spotted hyena

558
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:18,940
strayed into our town,
everyone wanted to kill it,

559
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:21,440
but my client risked his life

560
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,020
and saved the hyena
from the people's attack.

561
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:25,430
I only have one question.

562
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,810
How can a man who even loves
wild animals so much

563
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:29,760
kill those five men?

564
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:32,720
He killed those ruthless men
in an act of self-defense

565
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:35,900
to save his employee,
his daughter, and himself.

566
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:38,610
Your Honor, I request the court
to release my client

567
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:40,850
under the IPC
Right of Private Defense Act.

568
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:47,360
Bearing in mind the interrogation,

569
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:51,640
arguments, and statements debated here,

570
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:55,470
the court pronounces
Mr. Parthiban innocent

571
00:47:56,020 --> 00:48:00,860
as per the IPC Section 103 and 106.

572
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:07,310
He has been acquitted
of all charges and honored.

573
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:12,100
Also, I propose
the Indian government to award

574
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:15,180
Mr. Parthiban with
the National Bravery Award for this year.

575
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:19,400
Parthiban,
walk free with your head held high.

576
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:35,640
-Move!
-Move!

577
00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:38,110
-Sir…
-Please move!

578
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:42,010
Get out of the way!
All of you, step back!

579
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:44,980
-Is the decision to acquit you right?
-Move.

580
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:48,050
-Why did you have to kill five people?
-Move!

581
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:50,600
-Make way!
-Move!

582
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:53,560
Step back! Move!

583
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,600
Give me that.

584
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:58,400
-Get in.
-What are you doing? Step back!

585
00:48:58,480 --> 00:48:59,440
Move!

586
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:01,180
Get out of the way!

587
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:04,360
-Sir!
-Sir!

588
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:09,430
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

589
00:49:16,930 --> 00:49:17,890
Dad.

590
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:19,970
-Yes?
-You were right, Dad.

591
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:23,770
Even if we have a gun in our hands,
we shouldn't shoot.

592
00:49:23,850 --> 00:49:25,640
That isn't so easy.

593
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:27,890
Now, I understood everything.

594
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:36,430
Dad, I can't see you
disheartened like this.

595
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:46,100
Those dead men have
many cases filed against them.

596
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:47,890
They were dangerous.

597
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:51,060
They must have acquaintances.
Do you think they'll keep quiet?

598
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:53,060
Just to be safe,
be careful, Sathya.

599
00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:03,520
MUMBAI

600
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:21,020
SALEM

601
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:27,390
PEOPLE'S HERO FREED
OF THE MURDER CHARGES

602
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,190
SHIMLA

603
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:32,020
D'Souza, here you go!

604
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:35,860
THE CITY HERO
KILLS THE THUGS IN HIS CAFE

605
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,140
TELANGANA

606
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:45,730
I can't forget everything

607
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:49,300
and start working
at the coffee shop like before, Sathya.

608
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,680
I'm unable to focus.

609
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:59,100
I'm scared of the voices

610
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:01,010
Of the click, of the beat

611
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:03,440
Of the music I've been hearing all night

612
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,150
Pause, play, repeat!

613
00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:07,140
I'm scared of the mountain

614
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,150
Of the river, of the fire

615
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:13,400
Of the sound of lightening in the sky
Those sounds make me wanna cry

616
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,610
-This light above me
-I'm shit-scared of that

617
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,720
-Those colors
-I'm shit-scared of that

618
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:19,610
-These speakers
-I'm shit-scared of that

619
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,640
-Those woofers
-I'm shit-scared of that

620
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:23,770
-Bad trip
-I'm shit-scared of that

621
00:51:23,850 --> 00:51:26,050
-Those chills
-I'm shit-scared of that

622
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:28,140
Shit-scared of A, shit-scared of B

623
00:51:28,430 --> 00:51:30,140
Okay, I'm gonna pee

624
00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:48,390
I'm scared of the night
I'm scared of the day

625
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,440
I'm scared of my shadow
Get it out of my way

626
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,520
I'm scared of my past
I'm scared of my future

627
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,550
I'm scared of the present
Can't take this torture

628
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,890
-Dad!
-I'm feeling cold, I'm feeling hot

629
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:58,940
Just living in a fear of getting caught

630
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:01,020
I'm scared of the creepy
I'm scared of the crawly

631
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:03,010
And I swear, I'm not on molly

632
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:04,100
This light above me

633
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:06,010
-I'm shit-scared of that
-Those colors

634
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,050
-I'm shit-scared of that
-These speakers

635
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:10,140
-I'm shit-scared of that
-Those woofers

636
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:12,110
-I'm shit-scared of that
-Bad trip

637
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:14,140
-I'm shit-scared of that
-Those chills

638
00:52:14,230 --> 00:52:15,690
I'm shit-scared of that

639
00:52:15,770 --> 00:52:18,020
Shit-scared of A, shit-scared of B…

640
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:21,650
I had kept it somewhere here.

641
00:52:23,730 --> 00:52:24,860
Where is it?

642
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:29,890
What are you looking for?
You won't find anything there.

643
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:31,900
There is nothing left in the house.

644
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:36,060
How long are you going to sit at home?

645
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:39,610
The cafe has been closed for ten days.

646
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:42,220
You aren't even dropping off
your daughter at school.

647
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:44,940
Just look at their faces.

648
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:47,810
The court has declared you innocent.

649
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:50,510
Then why are you living
the life of a criminal?

650
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:56,190
You've not only locked yourself
inside the house but also your family.

651
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:58,940
Go get some fresh air.

652
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:02,930
I'll take care of the house.
Take the kids with you.

653
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:06,020
Go!

654
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:24,510
I feel like drinking coffee.

655
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:27,180
I'm going out to buy some milk.

656
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:29,650
Do any of you want anything?

657
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:51,730
-Greetings, sir.
-Hello, sir.

658
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:54,010
-Hi, sir.
-Greetings.

659
00:53:55,350 --> 00:53:56,300
He is the real man.

660
00:54:01,270 --> 00:54:03,150
Parthiban, I need to go to that shop.

661
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:05,230
You two come with me. Let's go.

662
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:08,430
Buy whatever you want. Come, Siddhu.

663
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:09,730
-Take care.
-Okay, Dad.

664
00:54:11,230 --> 00:54:13,560
Mom, I want a bread omelet.

665
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:14,680
Okay, let's go eat.

666
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,560
-One bread omelet, please.
-Okay, ma'am.

667
00:54:17,850 --> 00:54:19,800
-Eat it. I'll be right back.
-Okay, Mom.

668
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:26,860
-Hello.
-Sir, this is Kumar.

669
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:27,800
-I've got an intel.
-Okay.

670
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:29,550
There's some
suspicious activity in town.

671
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:33,510
The undercover source has informed us
that Parthiban's family is in danger.

672
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:36,550
We got this intel two weeks back,
but the inspector hid it.

673
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:40,180
-We have to stop them from going out.
-Yeah, okay. I'll call you back.

674
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:45,480
Parthiban, where are you?

675
00:54:46,270 --> 00:54:49,270
-I'm in the market.
-Do you see anything suspicious around?

676
00:54:55,270 --> 00:54:56,190
Parthiban?

677
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,550
-What's wrong?
-Listen, I've got intel

678
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:01,100
that some goons are after you.

679
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:04,260
Do me a favor. Drop whatever
you're doing, and just go home.

680
00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:05,430
Immediately!

681
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:24,560
Hey, only after I kill you and your family

682
00:55:24,810 --> 00:55:26,610
will I bury my brother-in-law.

683
00:55:26,850 --> 00:55:28,010
Finish him!

684
00:57:18,890 --> 00:57:21,350
-Hey!
-Parthiban!

685
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:24,520
Hey!

686
00:57:28,890 --> 00:57:30,100
Sathya, go!

687
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:33,680
How dare you lay
your dirty hands on my family!

688
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:46,190
Dad!

689
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:25,770
Parthiban, don't! Listen to me!

690
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:27,600
Parthiban!

691
00:58:34,930 --> 00:58:36,800
Parthiban, what are you doing?

692
00:58:36,890 --> 00:58:40,640
-Let go of me!
-No! Parthiban!

693
00:58:54,730 --> 00:58:57,360
Parthiban, what are you doing?
Let him go!

694
00:58:57,430 --> 00:59:00,260
If I let him go, he will kill us!

695
00:59:27,810 --> 00:59:31,310
Parthi, I'm scared to see you
sitting here like this.

696
00:59:32,310 --> 00:59:34,360
Let's come back
after the inspector summons us.

697
00:59:34,430 --> 00:59:35,890
Let's go home now, please.

698
00:59:36,770 --> 00:59:37,980
I'm not going anywhere.

699
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:40,480
-Kumar!
-Sir!

700
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:42,480
Why is it so crowded outside?
Is it a fish market?

701
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:44,690
-Parthi, let's go.
-Go and see.

702
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:46,980
What are our men doing outside?

703
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:50,230
What is it? I'd asked you to file
a complaint and leave, right?

704
00:59:50,310 --> 00:59:51,900
Why do you insist on staying?

705
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:54,600
Don't we have any other damn work?

706
00:59:54,930 --> 00:59:57,430
Go and tell him everything.
He'll note it down.

707
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,680
Just sign that and leave, got it?

708
00:59:59,770 --> 01:00:01,060
I'll see what I can do.

709
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:02,770
Hey! Send my tea inside!

710
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:08,800
Where are you going?

711
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:12,150
What will you see? How we die?

712
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:16,930
When we step out of the house,
we're scared of who might attack us.

713
01:00:17,230 --> 01:00:18,810
Why are you getting worked up?

714
01:00:21,890 --> 01:00:24,640
Two weeks ago,
one of the corpses from the shoot-out

715
01:00:24,730 --> 01:00:26,610
went missing from the mortuary.

716
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:30,100
The department asked you to alert us.

717
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:31,940
Why didn't you do that?

718
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:35,060
Who told you all this? The forest officer?

719
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:39,060
Do you expect us to think
about you 24-7 and serve only you?

720
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:41,180
-Don't we have other work?
-Just wait.

721
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:43,610
In all fairness,
I did what you should've done.

722
01:00:43,770 --> 01:00:46,230
I killed those
who tried to kill my daughter.

723
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:47,440
What did I do wrong?

724
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:51,110
Let's go home, please.

725
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:53,760
I want an armed guard

726
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:56,010
posted at my house 24-7.

727
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:57,430
I won't leave until then.

728
01:00:58,230 --> 01:01:00,110
Hey! Get up!

729
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:01,310
I said get up!

730
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:04,850
-Get up! Get lost!
-Please. Let's go.

731
01:01:05,430 --> 01:01:07,100
Do you think
you are a big shot?

732
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:08,010
Get out!

733
01:01:08,810 --> 01:01:09,650
Out!

734
01:01:11,430 --> 01:01:14,260
He wants an armed policeman, it seems!

735
01:01:16,310 --> 01:01:20,230
You can't just order us around
and get an armed cop at your disposal.

736
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:23,770
The government will decide
whether to give you security or not.

737
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:26,390
You are neither the law…

738
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:27,970
nor the government.

739
01:01:28,270 --> 01:01:31,230
You are just a common man
who sells bread and butter!

740
01:01:32,350 --> 01:01:34,510
Come in. We were waiting for you.

741
01:01:36,730 --> 01:01:39,150
He is scared of sounds.

742
01:01:39,810 --> 01:01:44,480
So, we should stand outside his house
holding a gun for his safety!

743
01:01:44,930 --> 01:01:46,430
And he'll make out
with his wife inside--

744
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:48,770
Hey! You're a police officer!
Mind your words!

745
01:01:48,850 --> 01:01:49,970
What did you say?

746
01:01:50,430 --> 01:01:52,850
-Parthiban!
-Hey, hold him!

747
01:01:53,060 --> 01:01:55,310
Parthiban, let go of him!

748
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:57,900
Parthiban, he's a police officer!
Let go of him!

749
01:01:58,350 --> 01:01:59,720
Parthiban, let go of him!

750
01:01:59,810 --> 01:02:01,650
Let go!

751
01:02:02,770 --> 01:02:04,650
Hey, hold him!

752
01:02:04,810 --> 01:02:07,940
-He'll die. Let go of him.
-Parthiban, let go of him, please!

753
01:02:08,430 --> 01:02:09,890
-Hey!
-What are you doing?

754
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:11,650
Parthiban, what are you doing?

755
01:02:11,850 --> 01:02:13,970
It will create problems! Parthiban!

756
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:16,260
-What are you doing?
-Parthiban!

757
01:02:16,350 --> 01:02:18,300
Parthiban, control yourself!
Calm down!

758
01:02:18,390 --> 01:02:19,600
Parthiban, stop it!

759
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:22,050
Parthiban, what are you doing?
Control yourself!

760
01:02:31,930 --> 01:02:34,760
Sir, are you okay? Is your neck okay?

761
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:41,510
Parthiban.

762
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:45,020
Are you crazy?
What was wrong with you?

763
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:48,220
You want police protection,
but why should they give it?

764
01:02:48,350 --> 01:02:52,300
There's no proof of assault against you.
You haven't been injured at all.

765
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:56,310
Who said that I'm not injured?

766
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:22,610
Parthiban, are you really sure?

767
01:03:22,930 --> 01:03:25,800
Joshy, I may go overboard
if I do it myself.

768
01:03:26,850 --> 01:03:27,930
So, you do it for me.

769
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,760
Okay. As you wish.

770
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:50,980
-SP.
-Yes, sir?

771
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:52,770
-Can you come to my residence?
-Right now?

772
01:03:52,850 --> 01:03:54,760
-Now. Yes, it's urgent.
-Okay, sir.

773
01:03:54,850 --> 01:03:56,600
Sir, I have a small request.

774
01:03:58,060 --> 01:04:00,690
Please summon a police officer
from my village.

775
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:56,060
900 KILOS OF DRUGS SEIZED

776
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:14,980
Napoleon reporting to duty, sir!

777
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:20,010
Where should I stand? Tell me, sir!

778
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:49,230
Whom have you sent?

779
01:05:49,310 --> 01:05:52,270
Parthiban, you asked for
a high-ranking officer from your village.

780
01:05:52,350 --> 01:05:54,430
He is the highest-ranking police officer.

781
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:57,190
You must've heard
of a drug bust in Trichy.

782
01:05:58,100 --> 01:06:01,550
I heard he was responsible
for catching 50-60 of those men.

783
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:57,180
-Move these tables here quickly.
-Yes, sir.

784
01:07:01,850 --> 01:07:02,680
Hey!

785
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:04,220
Put your phone down.

786
01:07:05,850 --> 01:07:06,800
Hey, listen!

787
01:07:08,180 --> 01:07:09,140
What do you want?

788
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:10,610
Hey, come here!

789
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:12,560
I'm talking to you! Hey!

790
01:07:25,730 --> 01:07:27,110
Hurry up! Load the stuff!

791
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:29,220
TELANGANA

792
01:07:30,270 --> 01:07:31,190
What happened?

793
01:07:32,980 --> 01:07:33,940
What?

794
01:08:01,230 --> 01:08:02,150
Hey!

795
01:08:03,810 --> 01:08:06,230
-Boss!
-Move!

796
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:10,390
-Boss!
-Get out of my way! Move!

797
01:08:13,390 --> 01:08:14,390
Boss?

798
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:31,390
You'd better pray to God
that it's important news.

799
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:33,010
Or you'll die today.

800
01:08:33,430 --> 01:08:34,760
Look at this picture.

801
01:09:00,180 --> 01:09:01,760
Hey!

802
01:09:05,310 --> 01:09:06,770
Hey!

803
01:09:07,230 --> 01:09:08,900
He is a freaking badass, man

804
01:09:09,230 --> 01:09:13,940
He's a badass, run for your life quickly

805
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:19,150
He's a badass, stay within your limits

806
01:09:19,230 --> 01:09:21,810
He's a badass man

807
01:09:21,890 --> 01:09:24,300
Leo Das, man

808
01:09:24,390 --> 01:09:28,890
He's a badass, run for your life quickly

809
01:09:28,980 --> 01:09:30,230
Got you, rascal!

810
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:32,390
Hey!

811
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:35,310
Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass

812
01:09:36,310 --> 01:09:37,940
Hey!

813
01:09:38,230 --> 01:09:40,310
He is a freaking badass, man

814
01:09:40,390 --> 01:09:42,970
If the lion is on the prowl fearsome
Feast is for the forest wholesome

815
01:09:43,060 --> 01:09:45,610
Fearing his hunt, scatter
Hither and thither, helter-skelter

816
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:50,760
Putting an end to gangsters countless
He'll punish them, he's ruthless

817
01:09:50,850 --> 01:09:53,640
Until now, he was a good soul

818
01:09:53,730 --> 01:09:55,980
Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass

819
01:09:56,060 --> 01:09:58,860
In this story, he has a demon's face

820
01:09:59,180 --> 01:10:01,010
He's a badass man

821
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:03,680
Not a matchstick, he's a volcano

822
01:10:03,770 --> 01:10:05,860
Don't mess with him

823
01:10:06,230 --> 01:10:08,770
Those who stay away from him are fine

824
01:10:08,850 --> 01:10:11,010
Keep that in mind

825
01:10:12,430 --> 01:10:14,220
Hey!

826
01:10:15,980 --> 01:10:18,400
He is a badass!

827
01:10:18,850 --> 01:10:21,100
Stay within your limits

828
01:10:21,180 --> 01:10:23,640
He's a badass man

829
01:10:23,730 --> 01:10:26,190
Leo Das, man

830
01:10:26,270 --> 01:10:30,900
Badass bona fide, dude
Take to your heels

831
01:10:34,350 --> 01:10:37,510
Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass

832
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:43,810
How many people should we send from here?

833
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:47,110
If he's really Parthiban,

834
01:10:47,270 --> 01:10:48,730
four people will suffice.

835
01:10:57,230 --> 01:10:59,360
But if he is Leo…

836
01:11:00,810 --> 01:11:03,860
-We'll finish him!
-We'll finish him!

837
01:11:03,930 --> 01:11:08,140
-We'll finish him!
-We'll finish him!

838
01:11:08,230 --> 01:11:09,810
LEO DAS
BORN: 13-05-1977

839
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:11,930
…even all our men won't be enough.

840
01:11:12,730 --> 01:11:17,810
Don't act too smart, man

841
01:11:17,890 --> 01:11:23,350
He will give you grief and strife
Beat you to a pulp and end your life

842
01:11:26,310 --> 01:11:28,810
Not a matchstick, he's a volcano

843
01:11:28,890 --> 01:11:31,350
Don't mess with him

844
01:11:31,430 --> 01:11:33,970
Those who stay away from him are fine

845
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:36,110
Keep that in mind

846
01:11:41,140 --> 01:11:43,720
He is a badass

847
01:11:43,810 --> 01:11:46,230
Run for your life

848
01:11:46,310 --> 01:11:48,810
He is a badass

849
01:11:48,890 --> 01:11:51,430
Stay within your limits

850
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:53,980
He is a badass man

851
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:56,440
Leo Das, man

852
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:58,770
He is a badass man

853
01:11:58,850 --> 01:12:01,720
Run for your life

854
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:10,440
Thank you.

855
01:12:11,770 --> 01:12:14,360
-Is it sweet?
-Bloody sweet.

856
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:16,850
Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass

857
01:12:16,930 --> 01:12:19,260
Leo

858
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:22,100
He's a freaking badass, man

859
01:12:22,180 --> 01:12:24,600
Leo!

860
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:27,220
Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass

861
01:12:27,310 --> 01:12:29,690
Leo

862
01:12:29,770 --> 01:12:31,230
Rest in peace!

863
01:12:34,890 --> 01:12:36,680
This one is…

864
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:38,720
It could be better.

865
01:12:39,350 --> 01:12:41,850
-I'll make it better.
-Yeah.

866
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:45,720
The girl sitting here has been
staring at you for a while.

867
01:12:45,810 --> 01:12:47,360
Don't turn around immediately.

868
01:12:55,810 --> 01:12:57,020
Maybe she's a reporter.

869
01:13:10,310 --> 01:13:11,400
-She left.
-Sir,

870
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:13,770
the man at the back
has been here for a while.

871
01:13:13,850 --> 01:13:16,300
He isn't saying anything.
Could you please check?

872
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:18,060
-Where is he?
-In the backyard.

873
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:19,510
Okay. Go, I'll handle him.

874
01:13:32,390 --> 01:13:33,850
"Pleasure is mine"?

875
01:13:43,980 --> 01:13:45,900
Hi, sir. What would you like to have?

876
01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:56,110
Coffee.

877
01:13:56,180 --> 01:13:58,300
-Sugar?
-You know very well…

878
01:13:59,770 --> 01:14:02,020
how many spoons of sugar I have.

879
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:07,980
How would I know whether
you prefer sugar or not?

880
01:14:08,390 --> 01:14:10,050
-I do.
-Okay.

881
01:14:15,850 --> 01:14:16,890
Just a moment, sir.

882
01:14:24,140 --> 01:14:25,100
Sorry, sir.

883
01:14:25,270 --> 01:14:28,480
-One sugar cube or two--
-You know that too.

884
01:14:29,730 --> 01:14:33,440
Sir, I don't know that.
You're mistaking me for someone else.

885
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:37,400
I'm just being friendly to you
because you're my customer. That's it.

886
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:39,300
Here is your coffee
and your sugar.

887
01:14:39,730 --> 01:14:40,690
Leo?

888
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:46,050
You are Leo!

889
01:14:46,930 --> 01:14:48,010
Parthiban.

890
01:14:48,310 --> 01:14:49,730
I don't know who Leo is.

891
01:14:50,230 --> 01:14:52,310
There's already a lot
of confusion in my life.

892
01:14:52,390 --> 01:14:56,640
Please don't add to it.
Please enjoy your coffee and leave.

893
01:14:57,020 --> 01:14:57,980
Do you mind?

894
01:15:03,020 --> 01:15:04,770
Can you make it a little stronger?

895
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:09,270
Sure, sir.

896
01:15:11,930 --> 01:15:13,970
Do you know this brand?

897
01:15:14,060 --> 01:15:15,650
No, sir. I don't smoke.

898
01:15:15,730 --> 01:15:19,270
-I can't even stand its smell.
-D Slash.

899
01:15:19,770 --> 01:15:23,190
You used to call it Honey Badger,
but it is Black Devil.

900
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:25,180
Twenty-five puffs.

901
01:15:25,770 --> 01:15:27,730
You invented this brand.

902
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:32,760
You like nocturnal animals, right?

903
01:15:32,890 --> 01:15:35,720
Once, a honey badger
entered our tobacco field.

904
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:37,220
Do you remember?

905
01:15:37,350 --> 01:15:39,390
It didn't get caught in your trap.

906
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:42,110
It didn't get killed
by Harold's spear either.

907
01:15:42,180 --> 01:15:46,010
In the end, it died
by the bullet that I fired.

908
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:48,110
You'll remember it now.

909
01:15:48,770 --> 01:15:51,650
Do you want anything else,
or shall I get your bill?

910
01:15:51,770 --> 01:15:54,480
So, you believe
your old identity doesn't exist, Leo?

911
01:15:55,180 --> 01:15:56,510
Wait, what?

912
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:01,720
Listen.

913
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:04,760
There are already
many problems in my life.

914
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:07,850
Let me tell you nicely one last time.

915
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:10,730
You're mistaking me for someone else.

916
01:16:13,270 --> 01:16:15,810
Look, I don't have patience.

917
01:16:16,180 --> 01:16:18,970
So, don't waste my time.

918
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:20,550
Mount View Lodge.

919
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:23,220
Come there and confess that you're Leo.

920
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:28,800
Sir, no alcohol, please.

921
01:17:03,140 --> 01:17:04,390
Start the car.

922
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:16,360
No alcohol.

923
01:17:36,850 --> 01:17:38,850
My colleague's friend stays in Kadapa.

924
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:42,980
I sent him a photo of the D Slash
cigarette box and got some details.

925
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:46,640
As per the details he gave me,
the chap who had come here

926
01:17:47,140 --> 01:17:48,050
was Antony Das.

927
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:53,680
Once upon a time, he ran
a huge tobacco company in Andhra Pradesh.

928
01:17:53,810 --> 01:17:56,230
-There was a fire at his factory and--
-Hold on.

929
01:17:57,310 --> 01:17:59,150
Why should I know
the life story of a guy

930
01:17:59,230 --> 01:18:03,150
who barged into my cafe
and blew cigarette smoke in my face?

931
01:18:03,230 --> 01:18:04,520
Because this is important.

932
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:06,390
-No, I--
-At least hear him once.

933
01:18:07,270 --> 01:18:08,230
Go on, Joshy.

934
01:18:09,230 --> 01:18:12,110
Antony Das had a son named Leo.

935
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:14,190
Okay.

936
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:15,850
Leo Das.

937
01:18:16,060 --> 01:18:19,150
I couldn't find any details
about him other than his name.

938
01:18:19,390 --> 01:18:22,470
Some people believe
he did something before he died.

939
01:18:23,020 --> 01:18:25,190
And some believe he is still alive.

940
01:18:25,810 --> 01:18:28,360
He can fool everyone.

941
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:31,940
He can fool the world.

942
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:35,850
But he can never fool me.

943
01:18:35,930 --> 01:18:39,550
In some odd way,
you have a striking resemblance to him.

944
01:18:39,810 --> 01:18:41,860
I saw his eyes.

945
01:18:42,730 --> 01:18:45,360
I know those eyes.

946
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:47,550
It is him.

947
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:50,050
Parthiban, you grew up
in an orphanage, right?

948
01:18:50,270 --> 01:18:52,560
Do you remember anything
about your childhood?

949
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:55,550
What is this? This is bullshit!
We are the victims here!

950
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:58,140
But the police
are treating us like the accused.

951
01:18:58,230 --> 01:18:59,610
-Let's go, Parthi.
-Wait.

952
01:19:00,270 --> 01:19:01,560
Sathya, wait.

953
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:03,440
Joshy.

954
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:07,890
I understand you're asking me
all this because you care about me.

955
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:10,520
But from my childhood, until I was 20,

956
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:12,850
I grew up in Sathyamangal Orphanage.

957
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:17,050
And I met her for the first time at--
What was that place?

958
01:19:18,140 --> 01:19:19,300
At the Munnar trekking.

959
01:19:19,890 --> 01:19:21,010
That's where we met.

960
01:19:22,060 --> 01:19:23,900
I saw her. We became friends.

961
01:19:23,980 --> 01:19:26,480
Within two days,
I asked her to marry me.

962
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:27,480
That's it.

963
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:30,980
After marrying her,
we settled here because of her job.

964
01:19:31,430 --> 01:19:34,350
I have been here since then.
This is my story.

965
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:38,680
They've come here
from the south, Parthiban. It's quite far.

966
01:19:39,350 --> 01:19:42,260
By road. If they came here
looking for you from so far,

967
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:44,140
it must be something important.

968
01:19:44,230 --> 01:19:46,690
The factory was closed down
because of him.

969
01:19:46,770 --> 01:19:48,900
Now, only he will start it again.

970
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:53,220
I'll make him do it.

971
01:19:54,180 --> 01:19:55,970
My world is very small, Joshy.

972
01:19:56,060 --> 01:19:58,810
It's like a snow globe
that we get at a shop.

973
01:19:58,980 --> 01:20:00,730
It has a small independent house,

974
01:20:00,850 --> 01:20:03,720
surrounded by trees,
snow, and cool breeze.

975
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:06,220
Why is this happening to me?

976
01:20:06,850 --> 01:20:08,390
At least you believe me.

977
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:10,100
Sorry.

978
01:20:11,810 --> 01:20:13,860
It's alright. I understand.

979
01:20:14,390 --> 01:20:16,640
If they come back
and cause you any trouble,

980
01:20:17,230 --> 01:20:18,650
we'll inform the police.

981
01:20:18,730 --> 01:20:21,310
Keep an eye on his family and friends.

982
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:23,400
Okay, boss.

983
01:20:31,180 --> 01:20:34,050
I feel like someone
is keeping an eye on us, Sathya.

984
01:20:35,270 --> 01:20:37,610
This eerie silence is making me restless.

985
01:20:38,890 --> 01:20:41,600
I feel very disturbed.

986
01:20:45,020 --> 01:20:47,610
Look at me. Understand this.

987
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:51,980
Even if the whole world suspects you,
I will always stand by you.

988
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:55,360
Have I ever questioned you?

989
01:20:55,980 --> 01:20:58,810
Stop thinking about these things,
and sleep peacefully.

990
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:03,430
Let's go, Parthiban.

991
01:21:04,980 --> 01:21:07,110
Are you planning
to sleep here standing up?

992
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:12,930
Don't touch the engine,
just fix the heater.

993
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:15,050
I want my jeep back ASAP.

994
01:21:18,730 --> 01:21:20,560
Get it ready by tonight.

995
01:21:48,140 --> 01:21:49,510
What do you want?

996
01:21:51,890 --> 01:21:52,970
I got to see you.

997
01:21:53,980 --> 01:21:55,060
That's enough for me.

998
01:21:57,020 --> 01:22:00,310
I'm so mad that if I slap you right now,

999
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:04,300
your face will be distorted for life.

1000
01:22:04,810 --> 01:22:05,650
Sorry.

1001
01:22:06,230 --> 01:22:07,150
Get out!

1002
01:22:10,890 --> 01:22:11,800
Keep walking.

1003
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:19,050
-Yes, Sathya?
-I got you the tablet you wanted.

1004
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:20,510
Do you want anything else?

1005
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:22,550
I've given the jeep for servicing.

1006
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:24,300
I had told you we'd go
to the pharmacy later.

1007
01:22:24,390 --> 01:22:28,100
-Why did you leave the kids alone at home?
-Mathi is with me.

1008
01:22:28,180 --> 01:22:29,510
Priya is also with me.

1009
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:31,470
You could've waited for a day.
What was the hurry?

1010
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:33,190
Some things can't be delayed.

1011
01:22:33,270 --> 01:22:35,110
Don't worry.
I'll take an auto home.

1012
01:22:35,180 --> 01:22:37,260
-Take care.
-Okay. Call me once you reach home.

1013
01:23:09,390 --> 01:23:10,220
No!

1014
01:24:04,730 --> 01:24:06,650
Don't be scared.

1015
01:24:08,930 --> 01:24:10,260
We're the same blood.

1016
01:24:11,350 --> 01:24:12,890
Do you know who she is?

1017
01:24:14,230 --> 01:24:15,440
My granddaughter.

1018
01:24:16,730 --> 01:24:17,940
My blood.

1019
01:24:19,930 --> 01:24:21,050
You were
at the cafe yesterday, right?

1020
01:24:22,230 --> 01:24:25,400
You'd better leave,
or I will call the police.

1021
01:24:27,140 --> 01:24:27,970
Police?

1022
01:24:29,930 --> 01:24:31,760
I am not here to trouble you.

1023
01:24:32,140 --> 01:24:35,350
The person you've been
living with for 20 years

1024
01:24:35,430 --> 01:24:39,260
is not Parthiban but someone else.
When you realize he is a ruthless murderer

1025
01:24:39,350 --> 01:24:42,260
who committed

1026
01:24:42,390 --> 01:24:45,300
many murders,

1027
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:46,980
come and meet me.

1028
01:24:48,140 --> 01:24:51,510
I'll show you the true colors
of your husband.

1029
01:24:59,140 --> 01:25:00,300
-Hello--
-Why didn't you answer the call?

1030
01:25:00,390 --> 01:25:02,050
-He was here.
-What happened, Sathya?

1031
01:25:02,140 --> 01:25:03,550
Who are you talking about?

1032
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:05,930
The guy who came
to your cafe yesterday!

1033
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:07,760
He came to the medical shop
looking for me.

1034
01:25:07,850 --> 01:25:10,180
-Okay. Where are you now?
-I am at home.

1035
01:25:10,270 --> 01:25:12,980
They followed me in their car.
It is parked outside our home.

1036
01:25:13,060 --> 01:25:15,770
Sathya, close the doors.
Give the phone to the police officer.

1037
01:25:15,850 --> 01:25:17,550
He is missing. I am alone here.

1038
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:18,680
I'm scared.

1039
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:21,480
Go to our bedroom and lock the door.

1040
01:25:21,850 --> 01:25:23,260
Siddhu and I are on our way.

1041
01:25:35,310 --> 01:25:36,400
Answer the call!

1042
01:25:37,730 --> 01:25:40,270
-Dad, what is it?
-Siddharth, go home immediately,

1043
01:25:40,350 --> 01:25:42,010
-and keep your spear handy.
-What are you saying--

1044
01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:45,260
If anyone tries to enter the house,
attack them with your spear.

1045
01:25:45,350 --> 01:25:46,760
-I'm coming too.
-Okay, Dad.

1046
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:12,720
Is this how our life is going to be now?

1047
01:27:13,270 --> 01:27:15,150
Always on the lookout. Always hiding.

1048
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:19,770
We'll have to keep worrying
if the kids are fine at school. Right?

1049
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:22,220
Tell me. Who is he?

1050
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:24,600
He claims that our daughter
is his granddaughter.

1051
01:27:25,100 --> 01:27:27,430
I feel terrified when I look at him.

1052
01:27:27,770 --> 01:27:30,730
Today, he cut someone's throat
in front of us.

1053
01:27:31,100 --> 01:27:33,760
And he did that just to save us.

1054
01:27:34,810 --> 01:27:36,110
Chintu, come here.

1055
01:27:36,180 --> 01:27:38,930
Let her be. She's already terrified.

1056
01:27:53,930 --> 01:27:56,430
-Sir…
-I pleaded with a lot of people,

1057
01:27:57,180 --> 01:28:00,390
I fought with a policeman,
and I pleaded with the judge,

1058
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:02,720
just to get you here…

1059
01:28:02,810 --> 01:28:04,940
so that you could protect my family.

1060
01:28:05,060 --> 01:28:08,360
Do you not have any honesty
towards your job?

1061
01:28:11,020 --> 01:28:11,940
Don't say that.

1062
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:13,730
I am expecting honesty from those

1063
01:28:13,810 --> 01:28:15,940
-who work only for money!
-It's not like that.

1064
01:28:16,020 --> 01:28:17,690
Instead of doing your duty,

1065
01:28:17,980 --> 01:28:21,650
you're always just sleeping!
It'd be better if you just left!

1066
01:28:21,730 --> 01:28:24,310
-You're getting me wrong.
-I don't think so.

1067
01:28:24,390 --> 01:28:26,390
Now, don't give me that crap

1068
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:28,150
and make me cuss you out!

1069
01:28:28,230 --> 01:28:31,560
-I just went to recharge--
-Stop talking.

1070
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:32,680
I said stop talking.

1071
01:28:32,810 --> 01:28:34,980
I'm controlling myself
considering your age.

1072
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:37,400
You're getting me wrong.

1073
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:40,150
-Sir…
-Go. Just go.

1074
01:28:41,430 --> 01:28:42,800
Such a pain in the neck!

1075
01:28:43,980 --> 01:28:44,860
I'm sorry, Dad.

1076
01:28:45,230 --> 01:28:48,230
-I-I didn't know it was you…
-It's okay, son.

1077
01:28:48,850 --> 01:28:49,970
That was a good throw.

1078
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:52,400
You proved today that you're my son.

1079
01:29:01,180 --> 01:29:04,010
The person you've been living with
is not Parthiban but someone else.

1080
01:29:04,100 --> 01:29:05,470
He is a ruthless murderer

1081
01:29:05,810 --> 01:29:10,610
who committed many murders.

1082
01:29:22,640 --> 01:29:23,550
A bad dream?

1083
01:29:25,020 --> 01:29:26,310
Yes. A nightmare.

1084
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:45,260
I think some major conflicts
happened in that family.

1085
01:29:46,270 --> 01:29:50,900
Maybe that's why
their tobacco empire got destroyed.

1086
01:29:50,980 --> 01:29:53,060
I have sent you
the photos and certificates.

1087
01:29:53,140 --> 01:29:55,850
Check if they are forged and tell me.
Okay? Bye.

1088
01:29:56,060 --> 01:29:57,810
There were many rumors about this.

1089
01:29:57,890 --> 01:30:01,010
But there is a man in the Shimla
jail who knows the truth.

1090
01:30:01,180 --> 01:30:03,970
His name is Hridayaraj D'Souza
in the records.

1091
01:30:04,060 --> 01:30:06,650
As per the intel we got,
he was Leo Das' friend.

1092
01:30:06,850 --> 01:30:09,640
If you want to meet him,
you only have two days.

1093
01:30:10,020 --> 01:30:11,980
I don't think you'll be
able to get here by then.

1094
01:30:12,060 --> 01:30:14,110
-Would you like to talk over the phone--
-No.

1095
01:30:14,180 --> 01:30:16,350
I-I'm leaving now.
Make the arrangements.

1096
01:30:16,430 --> 01:30:17,970
-I'll be there by tonight.
-Okay, Joshy.

1097
01:30:18,060 --> 01:30:20,480
-Thank you.
-Who is the villain?

1098
01:30:25,310 --> 01:30:27,940
It's late. Your mom isn't home yet.

1099
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:31,360
She has been coming home late
every day lately.

1100
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:33,600
-Is that so?
-Yes.

1101
01:30:35,310 --> 01:30:36,730
That's her.

1102
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:42,360
-Tell me.
-Parthi, I'm not coming home tonight.

1103
01:30:42,850 --> 01:30:44,390
Don't wait for me for dinner.

1104
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:48,360
-Why? What happened?
-I took many days off this month.

1105
01:30:48,430 --> 01:30:50,300
So, there's a lot of pending work.

1106
01:30:50,390 --> 01:30:52,680
I thought I'd finish it all tonight.

1107
01:30:52,770 --> 01:30:54,770
I yelled at Siddhu this morning,

1108
01:30:54,850 --> 01:30:56,550
so he isn't answering my call

1109
01:30:56,850 --> 01:30:59,010
Is he home? I was too harsh on him.

1110
01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:01,430
Ladies and gentlemen!
May I have your kind attention, please?

1111
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:03,020
Where are you going by plane?

1112
01:31:04,810 --> 01:31:07,190
-To the head office.
-Oh, the head office!

1113
01:31:12,140 --> 01:31:13,850
-Chintu.
-Yes?

1114
01:31:15,100 --> 01:31:17,850
You don't suspect your dad, right?

1115
01:31:18,060 --> 01:31:20,190
-No.
-Why?

1116
01:31:20,270 --> 01:31:21,900
Because you are my dearest dad.

1117
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:25,110
My dearest kid.

1118
01:31:34,350 --> 01:31:36,010
Hey, it's your dad.

1119
01:31:36,850 --> 01:31:38,140
Siddharth, get in the car!

1120
01:31:42,230 --> 01:31:44,940
-I said get in--
-Let go of my hand!

1121
01:31:48,640 --> 01:31:51,970
Uncle, don't force him
if he doesn't want to come.

1122
01:31:52,730 --> 01:31:54,560
What? Are you going to kill him too?

1123
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:03,480
Okay, don't come.

1124
01:32:14,060 --> 01:32:15,610
Who is the villain?

1125
01:32:16,350 --> 01:32:17,850
Who is the hero?

1126
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:20,100
Who is the villain?

1127
01:32:20,890 --> 01:32:22,260
Who is the hero?

1128
01:32:22,350 --> 01:32:25,680
You'd better not be anywhere
near my family from now on!

1129
01:32:27,430 --> 01:32:29,390
Who is the villain here?

1130
01:32:34,100 --> 01:32:37,220
-Sir--
-What are you doing out here in the cold?

1131
01:32:37,430 --> 01:32:38,680
No one will barge in now.

1132
01:32:38,770 --> 01:32:41,650
I don't care who shoots
and who dies anymore. Go to sleep.

1133
01:32:41,730 --> 01:32:43,190
It's okay, sir. I'm good.

1134
01:32:43,310 --> 01:32:46,060
This courier came in today.
It's for your wife.

1135
01:32:47,310 --> 01:32:50,310
Sir, one moment.
I wanted to say something to you.

1136
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:53,510
I understand all your worries and fears.

1137
01:32:53,770 --> 01:32:58,560
I see how much you love your family.

1138
01:32:58,770 --> 01:33:00,730
You can't see them in pain.

1139
01:33:00,810 --> 01:33:03,110
I will be retiring in 60 days.

1140
01:33:03,180 --> 01:33:08,100
If anyone troubles you or your family
in these 60 days,

1141
01:33:08,180 --> 01:33:09,800
I'll take them down with me!

1142
01:33:09,980 --> 01:33:13,480
Even if my family
is in an emergency back home,

1143
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:15,610
I won't leave this place.

1144
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:20,310
I swear this Napoleon doesn't work
just for money, sir.

1145
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:24,300
I consider my work my God, sir. Trust me.

1146
01:33:31,100 --> 01:33:34,140
Tell me, did you really kill
all those men with such a heavy gun

1147
01:33:34,230 --> 01:33:35,650
at the commissioner's office?

1148
01:33:37,390 --> 01:33:40,390
I just read the manual and told them
how to operate the gun.

1149
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:41,810
Dilli took care of the rest.

1150
01:33:41,890 --> 01:33:44,180
-Dad!
-Please don't tell anyone about this.

1151
01:33:44,270 --> 01:33:45,190
Okay.

1152
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:47,560
Chintu!

1153
01:33:57,890 --> 01:33:59,100
Have a seat.

1154
01:33:59,310 --> 01:34:01,060
-How is he doing now?
-He is fine.

1155
01:34:01,730 --> 01:34:04,150
It's been three weeks
since he last called me.

1156
01:34:04,270 --> 01:34:05,270
All okay, right?

1157
01:34:06,770 --> 01:34:08,730
Why did you come here at this hour?

1158
01:34:08,810 --> 01:34:11,110
If you had told me,
I would've couriered it.

1159
01:34:11,350 --> 01:34:15,180
The government registration is pending
because they don't have certificates.

1160
01:34:15,480 --> 01:34:18,270
So, we thought we would
come here and collect them.

1161
01:34:18,350 --> 01:34:21,180
They're in the attic. Let me get them.

1162
01:34:23,850 --> 01:34:27,890
Sir, this is Hridayaraj D'Souza.
You only have 20 minutes to talk to him.

1163
01:34:27,980 --> 01:34:29,560
I'll wait outside until then.

1164
01:34:35,180 --> 01:34:37,350
You asked for this brand, right?

1165
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:43,050
Hridayaraj D'Souza.

1166
01:34:43,850 --> 01:34:46,180
We don't have much time,
so I'll come straight to the point.

1167
01:34:46,890 --> 01:34:48,680
Das Company Tobacco Factory.

1168
01:34:49,230 --> 01:34:52,310
Its owners, Antony and Harold.

1169
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:56,650
We have some information about them,
but we have no details about Leo.

1170
01:34:56,770 --> 01:34:59,770
Leo's associates died with him.

1171
01:35:00,230 --> 01:35:02,940
Only one of his associates is alive,
and that's you.

1172
01:35:03,770 --> 01:35:05,190
Just tell me one thing.

1173
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:11,800
Is this Leo? Remember,
it's a matter of four lives.

1174
01:35:15,310 --> 01:35:18,110
I can see the fear of death in your eyes.

1175
01:35:18,350 --> 01:35:20,430
I know you will be hanged in three days.

1176
01:35:20,810 --> 01:35:24,060
If you tell me the truth,
I will send a petition now

1177
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:27,550
and appeal for a review
of your death sentence. So, tell me.

1178
01:35:30,230 --> 01:35:32,270
Tell me everything from the beginning.

1179
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:43,350
Hridayaraj, this is your last chance.

1180
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:54,140
If you're here for a fair and just cause,

1181
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:58,440
why did you come in from the back door
and sit near the toilet?

1182
01:35:58,850 --> 01:36:01,220
Whatever I had to say,
I said in the court.

1183
01:36:01,480 --> 01:36:04,810
No one can stop my hanging now.

1184
01:36:05,020 --> 01:36:05,860
Anything else?

1185
01:36:05,930 --> 01:36:07,850
What happened in that tobacco factory?

1186
01:36:08,230 --> 01:36:10,980
Is Leo alive or dead? If he's dead,
how did he die?

1187
01:36:11,100 --> 01:36:14,100
I'm not giving you this information
'cause you gave me booze.

1188
01:36:14,180 --> 01:36:16,100
I'll die in three days anyway.

1189
01:36:16,310 --> 01:36:20,230
No one is going to come
and question me then. So, I'll tell you.

1190
01:36:23,140 --> 01:36:26,600
In 1999, Das Company
was the most flourishing tobacco factory

1191
01:36:26,770 --> 01:36:29,230
in Andhra Pradesh.

1192
01:36:29,560 --> 01:36:32,650
The one who built
and ruled that empire was Antony.

1193
01:36:33,180 --> 01:36:34,510
Antony Das.

1194
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:39,440
It was pictured to be
a tobacco business,

1195
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:45,020
but Das Company used to run
many illegal businesses in their factory.

1196
01:36:45,230 --> 01:36:46,810
First, it was a local business.

1197
01:36:46,890 --> 01:36:50,640
But soon, they started
doing business internationally.

1198
01:36:51,060 --> 01:36:54,060
Antony used to never forgive
those who betrayed him.

1199
01:36:54,140 --> 01:36:56,760
He would kill them mercilessly.

1200
01:36:56,850 --> 01:37:01,390
He was someone who could
even scare the death angel.

1201
01:37:05,350 --> 01:37:10,010
Before starting any business,
he'd always sacrifice an animal.

1202
01:37:10,140 --> 01:37:12,890
He believed his empire would grow

1203
01:37:12,980 --> 01:37:15,560
if he sacrificed an animal.

1204
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:18,470
Initially, he used to sacrifice animals…

1205
01:37:18,810 --> 01:37:21,230
but soon, he started
sacrificing humans too.

1206
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:29,390
He was very superstitious.

1207
01:37:29,890 --> 01:37:32,140
Harold Das was his younger brother.

1208
01:37:33,980 --> 01:37:37,310
Harold was the only one
whom Antony trusted completely.

1209
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:38,550
Harold.

1210
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:43,050
Harold!

1211
01:37:43,640 --> 01:37:45,470
He went to Canada to study

1212
01:37:45,560 --> 01:37:48,190
but got acquainted with international
drug cartels over there.

1213
01:37:48,270 --> 01:37:50,940
He expanded their business
on foreign soil.

1214
01:37:51,270 --> 01:37:55,810
His dream was to make Das Company
the number one drug cartel in the world.

1215
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:58,690
So, he created a drug called datura.

1216
01:38:00,730 --> 01:38:04,440
It was a new drug on the market.
Nobody had heard about it.

1217
01:38:04,520 --> 01:38:06,940
They grew datura
amid their tobacco plants.

1218
01:38:07,020 --> 01:38:08,980
They began to manufacture it
in their factory.

1219
01:38:09,060 --> 01:38:11,810
Datura was more lethal than cocaine.

1220
01:38:11,980 --> 01:38:13,400
Gradually, its demand
increased in the market.

1221
01:38:13,480 --> 01:38:16,610
That's when some
of his men gave this news

1222
01:38:16,680 --> 01:38:18,300
to the Narcotics Control Bureau.

1223
01:38:18,390 --> 01:38:22,100
He threw datura on the faces
of those whom he suspected

1224
01:38:22,180 --> 01:38:25,930
He killed them all so ruthlessly
that even today,

1225
01:38:26,020 --> 01:38:28,980
people in the mafia world
have not forgotten about it.

1226
01:38:29,980 --> 01:38:32,190
None of his men betrayed him after that.

1227
01:38:32,270 --> 01:38:36,190
Even if Antony and Harold were
managing the business at the top level…

1228
01:38:37,810 --> 01:38:42,060
they still needed someone trustworthy
working at the grass-root level.

1229
01:38:42,390 --> 01:38:44,390
Antony had a son.

1230
01:38:45,140 --> 01:38:47,850
I have seen him grow up
in front of my eyes.

1231
01:38:49,140 --> 01:38:52,550
Das. Leo Das.

1232
01:38:54,730 --> 01:38:57,900
All this hassle is because one of your men
leaked the information to NCB.

1233
01:38:58,310 --> 01:39:00,610
Have you ever faced a problem
because of me to date?

1234
01:39:00,680 --> 01:39:03,350
I'm helpless, sir.
It's almost 200 kgs of drugs.

1235
01:39:03,430 --> 01:39:05,890
I can't show a wrong count
and dismiss the case.

1236
01:39:05,980 --> 01:39:07,440
It's not possible.

1237
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:09,610
One of you has to surrender.

1238
01:39:09,680 --> 01:39:12,600
Ask Leo to surrender.
Then you'll get your stash.

1239
01:39:12,770 --> 01:39:15,110
I can't do anything
if my seniors find out about this.

1240
01:39:15,180 --> 01:39:17,350
Don't worry.
I'll release him in a week.

1241
01:39:17,480 --> 01:39:20,310
What's the guarantee
that you'll release him in a week?

1242
01:39:20,390 --> 01:39:22,970
If you want your stash,
you have to trust me.

1243
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:28,480
-Yes, Antony?
-Is Leo there?

1244
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:29,650
He isn't here.

1245
01:39:30,020 --> 01:39:32,310
He said he'd cross the border
with the drugs.

1246
01:39:32,390 --> 01:39:35,390
He must be at the checkpoint.
I think he's outwitting them.

1247
01:39:36,100 --> 01:39:38,140
Hey, who is smoking over there?

1248
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:40,350
Hit him and get him here!

1249
01:39:41,480 --> 01:39:42,360
Tell me, sir.

1250
01:39:42,980 --> 01:39:44,020
Yes. I'm here.

1251
01:39:44,350 --> 01:39:45,720
Hey, move!

1252
01:39:48,430 --> 01:39:49,760
-Move!
-Rest in peace!

1253
01:40:15,430 --> 01:40:16,260
Get him!

1254
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:24,560
-Gabby! Start the vehicle!
-Hey! Go!

1255
01:40:25,270 --> 01:40:27,310
Load the stash! Hurry up!

1256
01:40:28,390 --> 01:40:29,300
Take this!

1257
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:53,400
POLICE

1258
01:41:12,430 --> 01:41:14,890
Hey! I worked for you risking my job,

1259
01:41:15,060 --> 01:41:17,730
and you're outwitting me
and getting me into trouble?!

1260
01:41:17,810 --> 01:41:19,270
Let me see
how you take your stash…

1261
01:41:19,350 --> 01:41:22,890
Leo!

1262
01:41:26,390 --> 01:41:27,300
Don't!

1263
01:41:27,850 --> 01:41:31,760
Leo!

1264
01:41:35,640 --> 01:41:36,890
Rest in peace!

1265
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:42,770
Leo found out

1266
01:41:42,850 --> 01:41:46,510
who ratted us out to the NCB
from within our camp.

1267
01:41:49,230 --> 01:41:51,060
-Gabby!
-Yes, boss.

1268
01:41:51,140 --> 01:41:54,140
I had told you not to stop the truck
anywhere, come what may!

1269
01:41:54,230 --> 01:41:58,060
Then why the hell did you stop there
with all our stash loaded in the truck?

1270
01:41:58,390 --> 01:42:00,470
Why are you asking me this? Ask Daniel!

1271
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:02,400
Every time I instructed him,
he said, "Call Leo.

1272
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:05,690
This load won't move an inch
until he comes here and settles my share."

1273
01:42:05,770 --> 01:42:07,230
That smart-ass threatened me.

1274
01:42:07,310 --> 01:42:09,400
You call him a friend,
so he takes advantage of you.

1275
01:42:09,480 --> 01:42:10,360
Summon him.

1276
01:42:10,980 --> 01:42:11,860
Hey!

1277
01:42:16,230 --> 01:42:17,810
You think you're a smart-ass!

1278
01:42:17,890 --> 01:42:20,390
What is your problem?
Why can't you work with him?

1279
01:42:20,480 --> 01:42:21,940
He is my problem!

1280
01:42:28,140 --> 01:42:30,260
Until yesterday, he used to work under me.

1281
01:42:30,390 --> 01:42:32,430
Today, I am working under him.

1282
01:42:32,770 --> 01:42:34,900
If you don't stop all this,

1283
01:42:35,140 --> 01:42:36,930
I'll put a halt to your business!

1284
01:42:39,390 --> 01:42:42,510
-What now?
-I don't want him butting in, that's all.

1285
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:44,390
If he does, we can't work together.

1286
01:42:56,680 --> 01:42:58,350
He was being a pain in the neck.

1287
01:42:58,980 --> 01:42:59,900
Right?

1288
01:43:20,310 --> 01:43:23,520
I don't about anything else but the stash!

1289
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:24,930
I'll do as you say.

1290
01:43:25,980 --> 01:43:28,520
Hey, let go of him!

1291
01:43:29,020 --> 01:43:30,110
-Hey!
-Hey!

1292
01:43:31,140 --> 01:43:32,510
Remove the damn knife!

1293
01:43:32,600 --> 01:43:34,640
I know who your next target is.

1294
01:43:34,890 --> 01:43:36,470
Put the gun down and leave!

1295
01:43:47,180 --> 01:43:48,890
Have you watched the movie Judwaa?

1296
01:43:48,980 --> 01:43:51,310
The one in which Salman plays
the role of twin brothers, right?

1297
01:43:51,390 --> 01:43:52,930
There is a tiny change here.

1298
01:43:53,020 --> 01:43:56,400
Both the twins in the film were men.
Here, it's a man and a woman.

1299
01:43:57,230 --> 01:43:59,860
Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass

1300
01:44:01,680 --> 01:44:04,260
Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass

1301
01:44:04,890 --> 01:44:06,010
Rest in peace

1302
01:44:07,020 --> 01:44:07,900
Leo.

1303
01:44:07,980 --> 01:44:12,060
It isn't easy to cross all the checkpoints
with 2000 kgs of datura overnight.

1304
01:44:12,230 --> 01:44:14,440
The police target our men
as if they're shooting mongrels.

1305
01:44:14,520 --> 01:44:17,650
It's too risky to transfer it overnight.
Tell me what to do.

1306
01:44:17,850 --> 01:44:19,800
Even though it was
an impossible task,

1307
01:44:19,890 --> 01:44:22,140
Leo decided to transfer
the stash overnight.

1308
01:44:22,230 --> 01:44:26,190
Leo took it as a challenge
to transfer 2000 kgs of datura

1309
01:44:26,270 --> 01:44:29,230
by crossing two inter-state borders.

1310
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:31,800
Imagine! Two thousand kilos of datura!

1311
01:44:31,930 --> 01:44:34,350
It was worth millions at that time.

1312
01:44:34,430 --> 01:44:36,970
He kept his word
and completed the task.

1313
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:41,220
Later, he took matters into his own hands
for his dad's sake.

1314
01:44:41,310 --> 01:44:45,560
Amid all this, Antony's quest
for human sacrifices didn't stop.

1315
01:44:46,430 --> 01:44:50,050
For two years, he was searching
for a unique horoscope.

1316
01:44:50,270 --> 01:44:54,190
He believed that if such a person
was found and sacrificed,

1317
01:44:54,640 --> 01:44:57,390
his tobacco factory
and business would flourish.

1318
01:45:01,270 --> 01:45:03,560
We couldn't care less about it.

1319
01:45:03,640 --> 01:45:07,470
We were just happy that the drugs reached
the godown safely. We partied hard.

1320
01:45:11,810 --> 01:45:13,520
Bro, listen!

1321
01:45:14,180 --> 01:45:16,220
Bro, come here!

1322
01:45:16,890 --> 01:45:19,550
Please come here, brother! For our sake!

1323
01:45:19,640 --> 01:45:22,470
Yes! Come on!

1324
01:45:27,680 --> 01:45:30,100
I'm ready, come on!

1325
01:45:30,310 --> 01:45:32,810
I'm ready and fresh

1326
01:45:33,100 --> 01:45:35,760
My grasp is like that of a lion's

1327
01:45:35,850 --> 01:45:38,470
No matter who tries to come in my way
I won't budge

1328
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:40,900
I'm ready, come on!

1329
01:45:40,980 --> 01:45:43,690
-Bro!
-Come on, dear! Try me!

1330
01:45:44,020 --> 01:45:48,980
Beat the drum
I'll make everyone dance to my tunes

1331
01:45:54,770 --> 01:45:59,520
A little bit of everything
Gets me going

1332
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:31,230
If God promises you to shower you

1333
01:46:31,310 --> 01:46:32,690
with everything you want,

1334
01:46:33,390 --> 01:46:36,100
he snatches something
from you in return.

1335
01:46:38,230 --> 01:46:41,020
I have good news and bad news for you.

1336
01:46:41,270 --> 01:46:43,900
Out of all the horoscopes
I have checked to date,

1337
01:46:44,680 --> 01:46:47,430
only these two horoscopes are of our use.

1338
01:46:47,930 --> 01:46:49,800
Please take a look and decide.

1339
01:46:51,060 --> 01:46:54,230
I'm ready to harvest
And weed out my opponent

1340
01:46:54,310 --> 01:46:56,360
It is our fate at stake
To get rid of this headache

1341
01:46:56,430 --> 01:46:58,970
If he acts like Smart Alec
We will tie him in a sack

1342
01:46:59,100 --> 01:47:01,800
Dump him in a lorry
To get dissected in the factory

1343
01:47:01,890 --> 01:47:04,890
Hey, we know all the blueprints
Our mission will be a success

1344
01:47:04,980 --> 01:47:07,440
If you interfere, you'll also be akin
To a lamb offered to our family deity

1345
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:10,560
Lamb for offering booze, cigarette, bidi
Everybody in our gang is trustworthy

1346
01:47:10,640 --> 01:47:13,300
As a team we work and think
Sharing a worldwide link

1347
01:47:13,390 --> 01:47:16,010
Our rules hold well in every city
Don't flick our tools to play dirty

1348
01:47:16,100 --> 01:47:18,600
We move and groove in unity
Our sync is our identity

1349
01:47:18,680 --> 01:47:21,550
I fight world wars not just a battle
Tired of winning every match I wrestle

1350
01:47:21,640 --> 01:47:24,430
Just one drum beat quick
Sure-shot power kick

1351
01:47:45,850 --> 01:47:48,800
I shouldn't have shown Elisa
and Leo's horoscopes to you,

1352
01:47:48,890 --> 01:47:50,220
but I had no other option.

1353
01:47:50,310 --> 01:47:53,150
I'm not sure
if we can find a similar horoscope

1354
01:47:53,430 --> 01:47:55,970
with the same star and date of birth, Das.

1355
01:48:07,640 --> 01:48:10,970
Hey! This cannot happen!

1356
01:48:11,100 --> 01:48:12,850
This cannot happen!

1357
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:31,060
Both Leo and Elisa are like my own kids.

1358
01:48:31,980 --> 01:48:33,520
But if you ask for my opinion,

1359
01:48:35,180 --> 01:48:36,430
I'll choose Leo.

1360
01:48:39,100 --> 01:48:40,010
No.

1361
01:48:40,310 --> 01:48:43,520
The decision… the decision is all yours.

1362
01:48:43,930 --> 01:48:47,010
Even a lion is nothing in front of me

1363
01:48:47,480 --> 01:48:49,310
I am great at hunting

1364
01:48:49,390 --> 01:48:52,390
If I really want

1365
01:48:52,930 --> 01:48:54,470
Even my eyes can start firing

1366
01:48:54,560 --> 01:48:57,860
My sword is more dangerous than a bullet

1367
01:48:58,390 --> 01:49:00,050
I know, I am great

1368
01:49:00,140 --> 01:49:03,260
But I can also be the reason
For someone's death

1369
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:05,730
-Do you get it, mister?
-Yes, master!

1370
01:49:16,350 --> 01:49:18,760
I'm known by another name too

1371
01:49:18,850 --> 01:49:21,510
You'll tremble in fear
Upon hearing it, dude

1372
01:49:21,890 --> 01:49:24,430
Print out the poster
All ready is your brother

1373
01:49:24,640 --> 01:49:26,850
Celebrate and how
Set it ablaze now

1374
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:30,110
Hey, make way for our bro!

1375
01:49:36,680 --> 01:49:39,510
I'm ready and fresh

1376
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:42,050
My grasp is like that of a lion's

1377
01:49:42,140 --> 01:49:44,850
No matter who tries to come in my way
I won't budge

1378
01:49:44,930 --> 01:49:47,350
I'm ready, come on!

1379
01:49:47,430 --> 01:49:49,890
-Bro!
-Come on, dear! Try me!

1380
01:49:49,980 --> 01:49:55,440
Beat the drum
I will make everyone dance to my tunes

1381
01:50:01,350 --> 01:50:06,050
A little bit of everything
Gets me going

1382
01:50:58,430 --> 01:51:00,470
Forgive me.

1383
01:51:01,230 --> 01:51:03,770
Between you and your sister,

1384
01:51:04,640 --> 01:51:07,600
all of them chose you to be sacrificed.

1385
01:51:07,680 --> 01:51:10,180
Even your uncle chose you.

1386
01:51:11,270 --> 01:51:14,190
I was the one who saved you!

1387
01:51:15,730 --> 01:51:17,900
You need not thank me for that.

1388
01:51:20,140 --> 01:51:21,550
Just forgive me.

1389
01:51:23,020 --> 01:51:25,230
Since I started managing our business,

1390
01:51:25,310 --> 01:51:28,980
I've killed countless people
for your sake.

1391
01:51:29,350 --> 01:51:32,510
I took your word as gospel

1392
01:51:34,310 --> 01:51:36,770
and killed my friend too.

1393
01:51:38,020 --> 01:51:41,400
But not anymore!
Enough with these superstitions!

1394
01:51:41,770 --> 01:51:43,520
Let go of Elisa!

1395
01:51:43,850 --> 01:51:45,300
Leo!

1396
01:51:46,020 --> 01:51:48,270
This is not just about our business!

1397
01:51:49,480 --> 01:51:51,810
-Why don't you understand?
-Hey!

1398
01:51:55,020 --> 01:51:57,310
She isn't just my sister.

1399
01:51:58,600 --> 01:52:02,140
She is my twin. She is a part of me.

1400
01:52:02,520 --> 01:52:04,980
If you do anything to her,

1401
01:52:05,560 --> 01:52:07,730
no matter how many births you take,

1402
01:52:08,140 --> 01:52:12,550
the day I see you, I will kill you!

1403
01:52:13,020 --> 01:52:15,060
The day I see you

1404
01:52:15,140 --> 01:52:17,640
will be your last day on Earth!

1405
01:52:19,600 --> 01:52:20,930
You're begging him?!

1406
01:52:23,230 --> 01:52:25,230
The day our mother died,

1407
01:52:25,640 --> 01:52:27,930
he didn't shed a single tear.

1408
01:52:28,350 --> 01:52:31,140
If he has decided
to sacrifice his children,

1409
01:52:31,810 --> 01:52:35,480
I don't consider him my dad anymore!
None of them are my kith and kin!

1410
01:52:36,980 --> 01:52:38,480
Will you do me a favor, Leo?

1411
01:52:40,480 --> 01:52:42,980
Don't spare any of them!

1412
01:52:57,850 --> 01:52:58,760
Hey!

1413
01:53:00,140 --> 01:53:01,550
Don't even think about it.

1414
01:53:04,890 --> 01:53:05,800
Hey!

1415
01:53:07,640 --> 01:53:09,890
Hey! Don't you dare!

1416
01:53:10,810 --> 01:53:11,900
Let her go!

1417
01:53:12,640 --> 01:53:13,640
Dad!

1418
01:53:14,480 --> 01:53:15,480
Dad!

1419
01:53:17,020 --> 01:53:17,980
Hey!

1420
01:53:18,730 --> 01:53:21,060
Let her go! Hey!

1421
01:53:38,980 --> 01:53:41,020
Elisa, try to understand!

1422
01:53:41,520 --> 01:53:43,020
You will be fine!

1423
01:53:57,770 --> 01:54:00,690
-Leo, burn down the entire factory!
-Elisa, stop!

1424
01:54:03,390 --> 01:54:07,010
Harold! Kill both of them!

1425
01:54:17,060 --> 01:54:17,900
Leo!

1426
01:54:23,020 --> 01:54:24,650
-Come on!
-Hurry up!

1427
01:54:28,390 --> 01:54:32,180
-Come on!
-Run!

1428
01:54:34,890 --> 01:54:38,550
-Come on!
-Catch them!

1429
01:54:42,980 --> 01:54:45,060
Hey! Don't spare anyone!

1430
01:55:09,350 --> 01:55:11,800
Don't leave anything out!
Burn everything down!

1431
01:55:12,140 --> 01:55:13,140
Everything!

1432
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:51,520
Hey!

1433
01:55:52,020 --> 01:55:52,980
Hey!

1434
01:55:54,390 --> 01:55:57,390
You wanted to sacrifice
your children for this, right?

1435
01:55:58,930 --> 01:55:59,800
Hey, Leo!

1436
01:55:59,890 --> 01:56:01,510
This shouldn't exist anymore!

1437
01:56:01,850 --> 01:56:02,930
I will…

1438
01:56:05,020 --> 01:56:07,860
-burn all of this down!
-Leo, stop it!

1439
01:56:11,430 --> 01:56:13,010
Hey! Give me the knife!

1440
01:56:19,230 --> 01:56:22,110
Elisa!

1441
01:56:31,350 --> 01:56:34,100
Elisa…

1442
01:56:35,640 --> 01:56:38,010
-Elisa…
-Leo.

1443
01:56:38,930 --> 01:56:41,640
Don't be with them, Leo.

1444
01:56:42,140 --> 01:56:43,050
Elisa!

1445
01:56:43,810 --> 01:56:45,900
-Elisa--
-Go somewhere far away.

1446
01:57:48,230 --> 01:57:49,230
Elisa!

1447
01:57:50,430 --> 01:57:51,600
Elisa!

1448
01:58:18,520 --> 01:58:20,110
That day, I saw the dead body

1449
01:58:20,390 --> 01:58:23,300
of the person whom I raised
with my own hands.

1450
01:58:31,180 --> 01:58:33,510
Tell me if this is Leo.

1451
01:58:36,480 --> 01:58:39,520
If you identify him,
all the problems will be solved.

1452
01:58:44,230 --> 01:58:46,270
Even if Leo stands among 1000 people,

1453
01:58:46,350 --> 01:58:48,850
I can identify him from his eyes.

1454
01:58:49,390 --> 01:58:50,470
This isn't him.

1455
01:58:50,930 --> 01:58:53,600
Don't play unnecessarily
with an innocent man's life.

1456
01:58:53,680 --> 01:58:56,100
Warden! Take me back!

1457
01:58:56,180 --> 01:59:00,050
I am feeling sleepy. Let me go.

1458
01:59:00,140 --> 01:59:02,180
Come on, get going!

1459
01:59:10,480 --> 01:59:12,730
We clicked this
when we were in third grade

1460
01:59:13,140 --> 01:59:14,600
and this in fourth grade.

1461
01:59:14,680 --> 01:59:16,390
And this in fifth grade.

1462
01:59:16,770 --> 01:59:19,440
This is the letter he sent me
when he was in college.

1463
01:59:19,520 --> 01:59:21,110
A NEW AND SCARY EXPERIENCE
TO STEP OUT

1464
01:59:21,180 --> 01:59:22,800
OF OUR SHELTERED EXISTENCE
FOR THE FIRST TIME

1465
01:59:26,060 --> 01:59:27,560
Can you do me a favor?

1466
01:59:27,770 --> 01:59:29,980
I'm asking you this as my brother.

1467
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:34,230
I know what's on your mind.
I won't tell him you were here.

1468
01:59:34,680 --> 01:59:36,350
Make sure he doesn't find out.

1469
01:59:36,560 --> 01:59:37,980
Or he'll be devastated.

1470
01:59:43,270 --> 01:59:45,150
-Hello?
-Sir, is this Parthiban?

1471
01:59:45,430 --> 01:59:47,720
-Yes.
-Sir, come to the coffee shop at once.

1472
01:59:47,810 --> 01:59:48,860
It's an emergency.

1473
01:59:51,060 --> 01:59:53,480
He was drinking with us, sir.

1474
01:59:54,310 --> 01:59:57,650
He kept saying he saw his friend.
He was very happy.

1475
01:59:58,480 --> 02:00:00,270
He even paid for everyone's booze.

1476
02:00:00,980 --> 02:00:02,900
Then he left in an inebriated state.

1477
02:00:02,980 --> 02:00:05,520
He was talking to someone over
the phone in the middle of the road.

1478
02:00:05,600 --> 02:00:07,930
Then some people arrived in a car
and took him away.

1479
02:00:08,020 --> 02:00:09,730
-Was it a black car?
-Yes, sir.

1480
02:00:17,270 --> 02:00:18,230
Hey!

1481
02:00:21,560 --> 02:00:25,400
He claimed to be your friend
and came to your cafe.

1482
02:00:25,480 --> 02:00:26,980
He even took your picture.

1483
02:00:27,060 --> 02:00:29,810
How do you know him? Tell me!

1484
02:00:32,730 --> 02:00:37,400
Sir, if I see my customer in this state,

1485
02:00:37,480 --> 02:00:39,810
I will be upset, right?

1486
02:00:40,890 --> 02:00:43,220
Look into my eyes. Do I seem upset?

1487
02:00:44,890 --> 02:00:46,430
I don't know him, sir.

1488
02:00:46,810 --> 02:00:50,310
Even though he died here at my cafe,
I have nothing to do with him.

1489
02:00:50,390 --> 02:00:54,050
I'll come to the station when you call me.
You can interrogate me there.

1490
02:00:54,230 --> 02:00:57,810
I've left my daughter alone at home.
I'm worried about her. I'm leaving.

1491
02:00:57,890 --> 02:00:59,680
-Okay, go.
-All right.

1492
02:01:29,180 --> 02:01:32,800
I don't know whether to feel sorry
for Parthiban or be suspicious of him.

1493
02:01:32,890 --> 02:01:33,930
Listen.

1494
02:01:34,230 --> 02:01:38,150
Every human being
can lie only up to a limit.

1495
02:01:38,680 --> 02:01:40,550
He won't be able to lie
after a certain point.

1496
02:01:40,640 --> 02:01:44,800
He can't continue to put on an act
beyond that point.

1497
02:01:45,430 --> 02:01:47,890
Because no one is that mentally strong.

1498
02:01:47,980 --> 02:01:51,190
I think he is not lying.

1499
02:01:51,480 --> 02:01:52,810
He really is Parthiban.

1500
02:01:53,890 --> 02:01:56,010
Only Leo can tell us

1501
02:01:56,560 --> 02:01:59,020
what the truth is.

1502
02:02:01,310 --> 02:02:02,480
Parthi, when did you come back?

1503
02:02:02,560 --> 02:02:05,980
Chintu said you had gone out
somewhere in a hurry. Where did you go?

1504
02:02:06,100 --> 02:02:07,930
I had so much work today.

1505
02:02:08,230 --> 02:02:10,400
Why didn't you have dinner yet?

1506
02:02:11,020 --> 02:02:14,730
Parthi, what happened?
Why do you seem so down?

1507
02:02:30,600 --> 02:02:34,760
From now onward, I have nothing to lose.

1508
02:02:36,060 --> 02:02:39,190
I'm a loser.

1509
02:02:43,230 --> 02:02:45,270
You can tell what the truth is

1510
02:02:45,350 --> 02:02:47,800
-Please…
-just by looking into my eyes, Sathya.

1511
02:02:47,890 --> 02:02:49,640
-Parthi--
-Don't touch me!

1512
02:02:50,270 --> 02:02:51,270
Don't touch me.

1513
02:02:54,730 --> 02:02:57,730
I don't care even if
the whole world suspects me,

1514
02:02:57,810 --> 02:03:02,020
but how could you suspect me?
How could you think I am someone else?

1515
02:03:02,310 --> 02:03:03,270
Sathya!

1516
02:03:09,520 --> 02:03:13,150
Everything's over. No matter what
justification you give me now,

1517
02:03:14,390 --> 02:03:16,430
the fact that you suspected me

1518
02:03:16,850 --> 02:03:18,720
will haunt me forever.

1519
02:03:20,480 --> 02:03:21,860
What did you do?

1520
02:03:22,480 --> 02:03:25,980
You broke the trust we had built
over the years in a minute!

1521
02:03:30,850 --> 02:03:32,970
I am not Leo!

1522
02:03:33,430 --> 02:03:35,550
I'm tired of telling everyone

1523
02:03:35,640 --> 02:03:38,640
that I am Parthiban! I am Parthiban!

1524
02:03:39,230 --> 02:03:41,650
What can I do if somebody looks like me?

1525
02:03:44,270 --> 02:03:45,860
-Sweetie…
-What happened?

1526
02:03:45,930 --> 02:03:49,800
I was not feeling well. That's it.
Go to sleep.

1527
02:03:50,060 --> 02:03:52,900
Dance for me…

1528
02:03:53,140 --> 02:03:56,720
I've never seen anybody
Do the things you do before

1529
02:03:56,980 --> 02:04:00,310
They say, move for me

1530
02:04:01,060 --> 02:04:04,860
And when you're done
I'll make you do it all again

1531
02:04:07,640 --> 02:04:08,800
Tell me something.

1532
02:04:10,060 --> 02:04:11,310
Just because

1533
02:04:12,680 --> 02:04:15,220
some random fellow,
some goon looks like me,

1534
02:04:15,310 --> 02:04:18,020
you'll blindly believe it's me?!

1535
02:04:18,680 --> 02:04:21,600
You've broken my trust!

1536
02:04:21,680 --> 02:04:23,850
Just because that man
said he was my father,

1537
02:04:23,930 --> 02:04:27,390
you started suspecting if I am
really your husband?! Why?

1538
02:04:31,100 --> 02:04:31,930
All right.

1539
02:04:32,560 --> 02:04:36,060
I don't know who my parents are
or what my place of birth is.

1540
02:04:36,390 --> 02:04:37,390
I'm an orphan.

1541
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:41,220
Maybe if my parents were alive,
no one would've suspected me.

1542
02:04:41,310 --> 02:04:43,980
-I'm an orphan, after all.
-Don't say that.

1543
02:04:44,140 --> 02:04:46,930
Parthi, you're not an orphan. Look at me.

1544
02:04:47,930 --> 02:04:49,300
Look into my eyes.

1545
02:04:50,100 --> 02:04:52,970
I didn't do this
because I didn't trust you,

1546
02:04:53,310 --> 02:04:57,020
I did this so that I could give people
answers when they questioned me.

1547
02:04:57,680 --> 02:04:59,050
"No. He is not that man."

1548
02:04:59,140 --> 02:05:01,970
I want to say confidently
that this is Parthiban!

1549
02:05:02,310 --> 02:05:03,810
Why don't you understand?

1550
02:05:05,930 --> 02:05:06,800
Sathya!

1551
02:05:08,270 --> 02:05:11,190
I want to ask you just one question.

1552
02:05:11,810 --> 02:05:15,190
How would you stay with me now

1553
02:05:15,890 --> 02:05:18,970
despite having a doubt
that I could be someone else?

1554
02:05:19,390 --> 02:05:20,760
Won't you feel disgusted?

1555
02:05:21,060 --> 02:05:24,360
Won't you feel like you're
staying with a stranger--

1556
02:05:32,850 --> 02:05:34,430
Trust me.

1557
02:05:35,980 --> 02:05:37,150
Sathya.

1558
02:05:40,600 --> 02:05:42,390
Please trust me.

1559
02:05:43,600 --> 02:05:46,760
I'm your Parthi. Trust me.

1560
02:05:59,100 --> 02:06:02,050
Leo, the time I gave you is over.

1561
02:06:02,140 --> 02:06:05,220
You didn't come to me.
So, I am here to see you.

1562
02:06:05,430 --> 02:06:06,350
Look outside.

1563
02:06:10,850 --> 02:06:12,890
Hey, who the hell are you guys?

1564
02:06:12,980 --> 02:06:14,560
What are you doing here?

1565
02:06:16,020 --> 02:06:19,440
Get lost from here,
or I'll kill all of you!

1566
02:06:19,520 --> 02:06:21,190
You won't leave this place alive!

1567
02:06:23,430 --> 02:06:25,430
You took it too far.

1568
02:06:26,180 --> 02:06:30,140
If you had come to me of your own accord
and admitted that you are Leo,

1569
02:06:30,560 --> 02:06:33,270
I wouldn't have come here.

1570
02:06:33,560 --> 02:06:37,110
Sir, don't come down at any cost!
I'll deal with them!

1571
02:06:37,600 --> 02:06:39,640
I just came to see you…

1572
02:06:40,020 --> 02:06:42,900
I don't know why
this mongrel is barking over here!

1573
02:06:44,890 --> 02:06:45,800
Okay.

1574
02:06:46,230 --> 02:06:49,520
Just tell me, where is your son?

1575
02:06:51,350 --> 02:06:53,260
Sathya, where is Siddharth?

1576
02:06:53,980 --> 02:06:55,360
-What happened?
-Where is Siddhu?

1577
02:06:55,430 --> 02:06:56,930
-Where is he?
-Do you see all these cars?

1578
02:06:57,020 --> 02:07:00,230
-Your son is in one of them.
-He isn't here!

1579
02:07:00,310 --> 02:07:01,270
Siddharth!

1580
02:07:01,980 --> 02:07:03,520
Get our daughter!

1581
02:07:03,980 --> 02:07:07,610
But your son is damn cute.

1582
02:07:07,850 --> 02:07:10,300
He came out to smoke
and got stuck in our trap.

1583
02:07:11,640 --> 02:07:12,720
You won't find him.

1584
02:07:13,390 --> 02:07:15,970
Parthiban, what is happening here?
Where is Siddhu?

1585
02:07:17,350 --> 02:07:18,550
Who are you talking to?

1586
02:07:18,890 --> 02:07:22,010
If anyone other than me
comes here, kill them. Just kill them.

1587
02:07:22,100 --> 02:07:24,390
-I can't do it--
-Don't let them go. Here.

1588
02:07:26,100 --> 02:07:27,720
Go.

1589
02:07:28,270 --> 02:07:30,020
Lock the door from inside, Sathya.

1590
02:07:30,850 --> 02:07:35,260
Okay, let's say you are not Leo.
But just think about it.

1591
02:07:35,600 --> 02:07:37,600
Why would I kidnap your son?

1592
02:07:38,230 --> 02:07:42,310
Today, 22 years ago,
your sister died.

1593
02:07:43,270 --> 02:07:44,690
On this day.

1594
02:07:45,020 --> 02:07:47,900
And now, I kidnapped your son.

1595
02:07:48,310 --> 02:07:50,440
Just imagine what I would do to him.

1596
02:07:51,890 --> 02:07:55,220
Don't you understand?
I do not have a sister!

1597
02:07:55,310 --> 02:07:57,310
Let go of my son! Tell me where he is!

1598
02:07:57,730 --> 02:08:00,610
Hey, step back! Get lost from here!

1599
02:08:00,730 --> 02:08:04,480
-Get lost!
-You'll definitely come, Leo!

1600
02:08:05,310 --> 02:08:07,900
Napoleon, open the door!

1601
02:08:09,600 --> 02:08:10,550
Hey!

1602
02:08:18,270 --> 02:08:21,980
-Napoleon, they've kidnapped Siddhu.
-I don't know when they took him.

1603
02:08:23,850 --> 02:08:24,930
Hey!

1604
02:08:26,890 --> 02:08:27,850
I'm also coming.

1605
02:08:36,770 --> 02:08:38,520
Here, sir! Shoot at them!

1606
02:08:45,930 --> 02:08:47,050
Load your gun.

1607
02:09:23,310 --> 02:09:24,690
Napoleon, handle the bike!

1608
02:09:25,850 --> 02:09:27,010
Watch out!

1609
02:11:07,560 --> 02:11:09,150
Where is my son?

1610
02:11:09,390 --> 02:11:11,260
Answer me, or I'll kill you!

1611
02:11:28,730 --> 02:11:30,020
Hey!

1612
02:11:37,310 --> 02:11:39,110
Siddhu?

1613
02:11:41,310 --> 02:11:42,400
Siddhu!

1614
02:12:20,140 --> 02:12:21,300
Where is my son?

1615
02:12:32,430 --> 02:12:33,720
I failed to kill you, Leo.

1616
02:12:35,140 --> 02:12:37,180
But I won't fail to kill your son.

1617
02:12:50,930 --> 02:12:53,010
I'm not the man you're looking for!

1618
02:12:53,100 --> 02:12:55,430
I told you so many times!

1619
02:12:58,770 --> 02:13:00,940
Where is my son? Come on, tell me.

1620
02:13:01,270 --> 02:13:03,940
Speak up! Where is my son? Tell me!

1621
02:13:06,270 --> 02:13:08,440
Accept that you're my son.

1622
02:13:11,060 --> 02:13:12,940
And I'll let your son go.

1623
02:13:13,230 --> 02:13:15,900
Oh, God! I'm not your son!

1624
02:13:15,980 --> 02:13:18,360
I'm not!

1625
02:14:04,850 --> 02:14:05,850
Tell me.

1626
02:14:06,230 --> 02:14:07,310
Who are you?

1627
02:14:13,850 --> 02:14:17,890
Harold, Leo killed Antony.

1628
02:14:19,600 --> 02:14:21,300
I'm coming there with his son.

1629
02:14:23,270 --> 02:14:26,110
The doctor said Napoleon needed bed rest.

1630
02:14:26,930 --> 02:14:30,350
They won't stop here.
They will come looking for you.

1631
02:14:30,520 --> 02:14:31,860
Your son will be safe.

1632
02:14:32,520 --> 02:14:34,810
The entire police force
is looking for him.

1633
02:14:35,600 --> 02:14:39,010
But you shouldn't stay here.
Your life is in grave danger.

1634
02:14:40,390 --> 02:14:41,680
Please listen to me.

1635
02:14:42,430 --> 02:14:45,140
I've arranged a car.
It's parked outside your house.

1636
02:14:45,480 --> 02:14:47,980
Collect your essentials and leave. Now!

1637
02:14:52,930 --> 02:14:53,850
Who is this?

1638
02:15:00,390 --> 02:15:03,390
Leo, no matter where you hide,

1639
02:15:03,480 --> 02:15:06,020
I'll come and find you.

1640
02:15:06,350 --> 02:15:10,100
Don't play with my ego
just to fan your ego.

1641
02:15:10,560 --> 02:15:12,110
If you want your son back,

1642
02:15:13,100 --> 02:15:14,850
hand over my brother to me.

1643
02:15:15,730 --> 02:15:18,480
Bring him here and take your son.

1644
02:15:30,060 --> 02:15:33,150
Here, Parthiban.
Go and save your son.

1645
02:15:44,930 --> 02:15:45,800
Hands up.

1646
02:15:49,270 --> 02:15:50,150
Keep walking.

1647
02:15:56,060 --> 02:15:58,150
Das, I've sent the boss' body.

1648
02:15:58,480 --> 02:16:01,610
We have boarded the train.
We'll be there in an hour.

1649
02:16:59,770 --> 02:17:03,150
Sir, as per your request,
I've given you your brother's body.

1650
02:17:03,980 --> 02:17:06,360
Please give me my son back.

1651
02:17:09,430 --> 02:17:12,680
I know, you won't believe me
no matter what I say.

1652
02:17:13,180 --> 02:17:14,680
-That's why I--
-Hey!

1653
02:17:18,680 --> 02:17:21,640
Don't be scared.
This is just my son's school bag.

1654
02:17:21,810 --> 02:17:24,400
Sir, this is my birth certificate,
and these are my educational certificates.

1655
02:17:24,480 --> 02:17:26,270
This is my ration card, Aadhar card,
and wedding photos.

1656
02:17:26,350 --> 02:17:28,100
This was clicked
when my daughter was born.

1657
02:17:28,180 --> 02:17:29,760
This was clicked
on my son's first birthday.

1658
02:17:29,850 --> 02:17:30,760
Look at this.

1659
02:17:30,850 --> 02:17:34,930
This was clicked when I first sang
a patriotic song on the stage.

1660
02:17:35,140 --> 02:17:38,220
You don't believe me? See,
my name is here on the certificate.

1661
02:17:44,980 --> 02:17:50,020
Look. This is you
and your sister on your birthday.

1662
02:17:50,100 --> 02:17:53,390
This is the honey badger
that had entered our tobacco field.

1663
02:17:53,680 --> 02:17:55,640
This photo was clicked
after it was killed.

1664
02:17:55,730 --> 02:17:57,810
Look how smart you look
with that blood-stained face!

1665
02:17:57,890 --> 02:17:58,890
I understand, sir.

1666
02:17:59,980 --> 02:18:03,440
It's not your fault
that you mistook me for Leo, sir.

1667
02:18:03,520 --> 02:18:05,480
He looks just like me.

1668
02:18:09,730 --> 02:18:11,980
Do you think I'm a fool?

1669
02:18:13,310 --> 02:18:15,940
-Sir…
-Do you think you're too smart?

1670
02:18:18,430 --> 02:18:19,510
Leo.

1671
02:18:19,930 --> 02:18:22,930
You know what I did to your twin sister.

1672
02:18:23,270 --> 02:18:25,150
I'm sure you haven't forgotten that.

1673
02:18:26,310 --> 02:18:28,270
You'd better accept that you are Leo.

1674
02:18:31,430 --> 02:18:35,300
Sir, I don't have a sister.
How do I make you understand?

1675
02:18:35,390 --> 02:18:36,300
Siddhu?

1676
02:18:45,020 --> 02:18:45,860
Sir.

1677
02:18:48,560 --> 02:18:51,230
In all these years,
he is scrutinizing someone

1678
02:18:51,680 --> 02:18:53,350
for the first time.

1679
02:18:53,810 --> 02:18:57,560
Human beings can lie.
Certificates can be fake.

1680
02:18:58,140 --> 02:19:00,680
But birds and animals never lie.

1681
02:19:00,770 --> 02:19:04,480
I've never seen an eagle
so closely in my life, sir.

1682
02:19:04,980 --> 02:19:07,150
Get it away from me. I'm scared.

1683
02:19:14,230 --> 02:19:18,360
Hey. You're putting up this act
just to protect your family, right?

1684
02:19:18,560 --> 02:19:20,690
But you committed a blunder there.

1685
02:19:21,100 --> 02:19:23,260
You came here to save your son

1686
02:19:23,390 --> 02:19:27,970
but left your wife and your daughter
all alone at home. You're not that smart.

1687
02:19:28,770 --> 02:19:30,060
How would you feel

1688
02:19:30,140 --> 02:19:34,970
if I asked my men
to kill your wife and daughter?

1689
02:19:35,850 --> 02:19:36,800
Hey!

1690
02:19:37,060 --> 02:19:38,810
-Get started.
-Okay, boss.

1691
02:19:49,230 --> 02:19:51,360
Sir, don't harm them.

1692
02:19:51,810 --> 02:19:52,860
Please, sir.

1693
02:19:57,390 --> 02:19:59,930
Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass

1694
02:20:01,770 --> 02:20:03,940
Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass

1695
02:20:04,350 --> 02:20:05,470
Hey!

1696
02:20:05,560 --> 02:20:08,770
-What happened?
-Ask them not to harm my family, sir.

1697
02:20:33,020 --> 02:20:35,560
-What is it, Mom?
-Nothing, dear. Go back to sleep.

1698
02:20:35,810 --> 02:20:38,610
Sir, ask them not to go in.

1699
02:20:38,680 --> 02:20:40,600
-What's happening there?
-Sir, please.

1700
02:20:40,850 --> 02:20:41,760
Keep moving.

1701
02:20:57,980 --> 02:20:58,980
Come with me.

1702
02:21:01,770 --> 02:21:03,400
Hey, you, climb up.

1703
02:21:06,270 --> 02:21:07,940
-Hey!
-Sir…

1704
02:21:08,020 --> 02:21:10,440
-Hey!
-Someone, please tell him.

1705
02:21:10,680 --> 02:21:12,760
Tell them not to go in, sir. Please.

1706
02:21:12,850 --> 02:21:14,720
I am Parthiban, sir. I told you.

1707
02:21:22,850 --> 02:21:25,260
Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass

1708
02:21:27,180 --> 02:21:29,760
Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass

1709
02:21:37,350 --> 02:21:39,430
-You climb up.
-I'm scared of heights.

1710
02:21:39,520 --> 02:21:40,440
Hey! Just go!

1711
02:21:51,480 --> 02:21:52,560
My side is all clear.

1712
02:21:53,100 --> 02:21:55,510
Some of them are entering
through the main door.

1713
02:22:29,350 --> 02:22:30,260
Hey!

1714
02:23:08,230 --> 02:23:09,110
Hey--

1715
02:23:12,600 --> 02:23:13,550
Sir.

1716
02:23:13,640 --> 02:23:17,890
I killed all those who barged in
except for one guy.

1717
02:23:18,020 --> 02:23:19,900
He came in from a window.

1718
02:23:19,980 --> 02:23:22,020
Okay, Napoleon. I'll handle them.

1719
02:23:35,560 --> 02:23:36,560
Hey!

1720
02:23:36,640 --> 02:23:39,850
Are you playing the fool with me?
I won't spare you!

1721
02:23:42,850 --> 02:23:44,890
-Sir, please…
-Hey!

1722
02:23:44,980 --> 02:23:47,190
-Sir.
-Why are you hanging up on me?

1723
02:23:47,270 --> 02:23:49,020
-Sir.
-What is going on there?

1724
02:23:49,100 --> 02:23:51,970
He's very smart.
He's set up traps all around the house.

1725
02:23:52,060 --> 02:23:53,440
All our men are dead.

1726
02:23:53,980 --> 02:23:57,360
Believe me. He is definitely Leo.

1727
02:23:57,730 --> 02:23:58,940
Who is in front of you?

1728
02:23:59,020 --> 02:24:01,110
His wife and daughter.
Shall I kill them?

1729
02:24:01,930 --> 02:24:04,220
No need. Put the phone on speakerphone.

1730
02:24:04,480 --> 02:24:06,190
Point the phone towards his wife.

1731
02:24:09,140 --> 02:24:12,010
You still have time.
Accept that you are Leo.

1732
02:24:12,310 --> 02:24:13,610
Then I'll let them go.

1733
02:24:15,180 --> 02:24:16,220
Parthi!

1734
02:24:19,640 --> 02:24:21,220
Sathya, don't panic.

1735
02:24:24,770 --> 02:24:25,810
Accept it.

1736
02:24:31,680 --> 02:24:32,850
Chakadbangadu.

1737
02:24:57,560 --> 02:24:58,480
Hey!

1738
02:24:58,560 --> 02:25:00,520
Did I make a joke?
Why are you laughing?

1739
02:25:00,680 --> 02:25:01,680
Me?

1740
02:25:02,680 --> 02:25:04,100
I think it's some rabid dog.

1741
02:25:20,730 --> 02:25:21,610
Hello?

1742
02:25:26,480 --> 02:25:29,730
I'd told you to instruct your men
not to go in, sir.

1743
02:25:29,810 --> 02:25:31,310
The poor fellows are all dead.

1744
02:26:00,730 --> 02:26:02,520
Now, the Leo we know will emerge.

1745
02:26:34,520 --> 02:26:37,940
Chittu, he has to accept that he's Leo.

1746
02:27:08,060 --> 02:27:09,650
Don't let go of him!

1747
02:28:13,730 --> 02:28:15,060
Chop him into pieces!

1748
02:29:16,350 --> 02:29:18,180
Hey, keep an eye on his son.

1749
02:31:20,850 --> 02:31:21,970
Hey, Leo!

1750
02:31:22,100 --> 02:31:24,800
Remember? I used this to kill your sister.

1751
02:32:07,560 --> 02:32:08,730
Now, I am sure…

1752
02:32:10,140 --> 02:32:11,180
that you are not Leo.

1753
02:32:11,850 --> 02:32:13,010
You are Parthiban.

1754
02:32:14,430 --> 02:32:17,760
You are not the person…

1755
02:32:20,310 --> 02:32:21,310
I was looking for.

1756
02:32:22,230 --> 02:32:23,480
Let's call it quits.

1757
02:32:24,020 --> 02:32:25,060
What do you say?

1758
02:32:26,230 --> 02:32:27,400
Drop your gun.

1759
02:32:28,520 --> 02:32:29,480
Hey!

1760
02:32:30,230 --> 02:32:32,770
Lower your gun.
Didn't you hear it? Lower it.

1761
02:32:33,930 --> 02:32:36,140
Hey, either shoot at me or drop it!

1762
02:32:36,520 --> 02:32:37,520
Come on!

1763
02:33:01,520 --> 02:33:05,770
Leo!

1764
02:33:07,850 --> 02:33:10,720
Leo!

1765
02:33:15,430 --> 02:33:19,470
-If I'm sweet, you're bloody sweet, Uncle.
-Hey!

1766
02:33:21,270 --> 02:33:24,900
I should've killed you
that day itself!

1767
02:33:25,890 --> 02:33:27,140
I made a mistake.

1768
02:33:29,390 --> 02:33:34,970
-Go to hell!
-Leo!

1769
02:33:35,680 --> 02:33:37,550
You dug your own grave!

1770
02:33:37,890 --> 02:33:40,260
"I want to see Leo. I want to find Leo."

1771
02:33:41,810 --> 02:33:43,190
You called me here!

1772
02:33:44,140 --> 02:33:45,140
Happy now?

1773
02:33:45,230 --> 02:33:50,190
Leo!

1774
02:34:01,640 --> 02:34:02,890
Drop your gun.

1775
02:34:15,060 --> 02:34:17,400
Go outside and check
if there are any vehicles.

1776
02:34:22,600 --> 02:34:24,640
When we talk about one's past,

1777
02:34:24,730 --> 02:34:26,940
we get to hear some good things.

1778
02:34:27,810 --> 02:34:29,860
But that's not the case with me.

1779
02:34:30,600 --> 02:34:34,550
Knowingly or unknowingly,
I have made many mistakes in the past.

1780
02:34:34,930 --> 02:34:39,140
The last chance I got to rectify
those mistakes was my family.

1781
02:34:39,560 --> 02:34:44,060
I will go to any extent
to protect this family.

1782
02:34:44,850 --> 02:34:47,350
The man called Leo is dead.

1783
02:34:48,430 --> 02:34:51,760
Now, if I have to convince
everyone that he is dead,

1784
02:34:52,180 --> 02:34:55,140
then first, I have to believe it myself.

1785
02:34:56,060 --> 02:34:58,610
I've accepted that Leo is dead.

1786
02:35:09,180 --> 02:35:10,470
How are you?

1787
02:35:12,520 --> 02:35:14,610
No matter how many people

1788
02:35:15,640 --> 02:35:19,470
come and ask me if I'm Leo,
I'll convince them all.

1789
02:35:20,930 --> 02:35:24,300
Even after all this, if someone
insists on knowing my story,

1790
02:35:24,680 --> 02:35:30,260
I'll tell them, but then
I'll kill them the next minute.

1791
02:35:38,230 --> 02:35:40,150
Of course, I'm Leo.

1792
02:35:41,180 --> 02:35:42,800
Leo Das!

1793
02:35:43,930 --> 02:35:46,300
My life is in this town

1794
02:35:46,390 --> 02:35:48,390
And I ain't going down

1795
02:35:48,480 --> 02:35:53,230
You think that I'm crazy
But I don't want the crown

1796
02:35:53,600 --> 02:35:55,640
My life is in this town

1797
02:35:56,020 --> 02:35:58,060
And I ain't going down

1798
02:35:58,390 --> 02:36:02,680
You think that I'm crazy
But I don't want the crown

1799
02:36:02,810 --> 02:36:06,110
Just an ordinary person

1800
02:36:06,350 --> 02:36:10,350
Yeah, I'm just a peace-loving soul

1801
02:36:11,890 --> 02:36:16,930
I'm just an ordinary person, yeah!

1802
02:36:17,100 --> 02:36:19,970
I'm just a peace-loving soul

1803
02:36:20,890 --> 02:36:22,260
Peace-loving soul

1804
02:36:22,350 --> 02:36:24,720
My life is in this town

1805
02:36:58,520 --> 02:37:01,560
I tried to tell everyone
that I am not Leo.

1806
02:37:01,770 --> 02:37:03,860
But no one believed me. They hit me.

1807
02:37:04,310 --> 02:37:08,810
Finally, they accepted that I'm not Leo.
Other than this, nothing happened.

1808
02:37:08,890 --> 02:37:10,890
Promise me this is
what you'll tell your mom.

1809
02:37:10,980 --> 02:37:13,810
You promise me
you won't tell mom that I smoke.

1810
02:37:13,930 --> 02:37:17,510
I'm just an ordinary person!

1811
02:37:17,770 --> 02:37:21,770
Yeah, I'm just a peace-loving soul

1812
02:37:23,680 --> 02:37:27,260
I'm just an ordinary person!

1813
02:37:27,770 --> 02:37:31,360
Yeah! I'm just a peace-loving soul

1814
02:37:32,140 --> 02:37:33,850
Peace-loving soul

1815
02:37:35,390 --> 02:37:38,430
-What happened to your face, Dad?
-Keep quiet.

1816
02:37:38,890 --> 02:37:40,600
Siddhu, switch on the TV.

1817
02:37:49,730 --> 02:37:53,690
All you crazy people, try to recognize me

1818
02:37:53,770 --> 02:37:57,360
From where I came and who I am

1819
02:37:57,430 --> 02:38:01,050
All you crazy people, try to recognize me

1820
02:38:01,140 --> 02:38:04,550
From where I came and who I am

1821
02:38:05,770 --> 02:38:08,190
I think I forgot to lock the main door.

1822
02:38:08,890 --> 02:38:10,140
Shall I go and lock it?

1823
02:38:31,020 --> 02:38:31,980
Hello.

1824
02:38:32,270 --> 02:38:35,230
Just because you burned down
one datura factory,

1825
02:38:35,310 --> 02:38:39,560
do you think all your problems
will be solved, Parthiban--

1826
02:38:39,810 --> 02:38:41,400
Oh. I'm sorry.

1827
02:38:42,100 --> 02:38:43,140
Leo.

1828
02:38:46,060 --> 02:38:48,810
If you want to make
this society drug-free,

1829
02:38:49,430 --> 02:38:52,640
you will have to burn down
many other factories in India.

1830
02:38:53,520 --> 02:38:56,400
Do you want to know who I am?

1831
02:38:59,680 --> 02:39:01,760
