Absolutely.

135
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,595
Do you or do you not possess
a specialized weapon?

136
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,471
- I do not.
- You do not?

137
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:23,099
I do not. Well, it depends
on how you define the word "weapon."

138
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:26,311
- The Iron Man weapon.
- My device does not fit that description.

139
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,104
Well, how would you describe it?

140
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:31,274
I would describe it by defining it
as what it is, Senator.

141
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:34,277
- As?
- It's a high-tech prosthesis.

142

<font color="#87CEFA">(all laughing)</font>

143
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:36,487
That is... That is...

144
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:38,615
That's actually the most apt description
I can make of it.

145
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,617
It's a weapon. It's a weapon, Mr. Stark.

146
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,786
Please, if your priority was actually
the well-being of the American citizen...

147
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,748
My priority is to get the Iron Man
weapon turned over to the people

148
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:50,210
- of the United States of America.
- Well, you can forget it.

149
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,505
I am Iron Man. The suit and I are one.

150
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:57,091
To turn over the Iron Man suit
would be to turn over myself,

151
00:11:57,175 --> 00:12:00,136
which is tantamount
to indentured servitude or prostitution,

152
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,930
depending on what state you're in.

153
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:04,974
- You can't have it.
- Look, I'm no expert...

154
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,644
In prostitution? Of course not.
You're a senator. Come on.

156
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,190
I'm no expert in weapons.

157
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,150
We have somebody here
who is an expert on weapons.

158
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:19,030
I'd now like to call Justin Hammer,
our current primary weapons contractor.

159
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:23,493
Let the record reflect that I observed
Mr. Hammer entering the chamber,

160
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,911
and I am wondering

161
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:28,331
if and when any actual expert
will also be in attendance.

164
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:38,091
Absolutely. I'm no expert. I defer
to you, Anthony. You're the wonder boy.

165
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:43,304
Senator, if I may.
I may well not be an expert,

166
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:45,848
but you know who was the expert?

167
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:48,559
Your dad. Howard Stark.

168
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:53,106
Really a father to us all,
and to the military-industrial age.

169
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:57,318
Let's just be clear.
He was no flower child. He was a lion.

170
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:00,697
We all know why we're here.
In the last six months,

171
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,909
Anthony Stark has created a sword
with untold possibilities.

172
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:07,704
And yet he insists it's a shield.

173
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:12,542
He asks us to trust him
as we cower behind it.

174
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,920
I wish I were comforted, Anthony,
I really do.

175
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:19,090
I'd love to leave my door unlocked
when I leave the house,

176
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,550
but this ain't Canada.

177
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,385
You know, we live in a world
of grave threats,

178
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:26,264
threats that Mr. Stark
will not always be able to foresee.

179
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:31,602
Thank you.
God bless Iron Man. God bless America.

180
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,772
That is well said, Mr. Hammer.

181
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:36,858
The committee would now like to invite

182
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:40,069
Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes
to the chamber.

183
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,654
Rhodey? What?

184
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:51,247
Hey, buddy.
I didn't expect to see you here.

185
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:53,916
Look, it's me, I'm here.
Deal with it. Let's move on.

186
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,084

report on the Iron Man weapon,

189

compiled by Colonel Rhodes.
And, Colonel, for the record,

190
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:06,137
can you please read page 57,
paragraph four?

191
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,556
You're requesting
that I read specific selections

192
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,932
- from my report, Senator?
- Yes, sir.

193
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,934
It was my understanding
that I was going to be testifying

194
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,145
in a much more comprehensive
and detailed manner.

195
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,897
I understand.
A lot of things have changed today.

196
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,273
- So if you could just read...
- You do understand

197
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,776
that reading a single paragraph
out of context does not reflect

198
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:23,071
- the summary of my final...
- Just read it, Colonel. I do. Thank you.

199
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,531
Very well.

200
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,828

any definable branch of government,

to the security of both the nation

202

"and to her interests."

203
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:41,464
I did, however, go on to summarize
that the benefits of Iron Man

204
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,132
- far outweigh the liabilities.
- Uh... Uh... Uh...

205
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,426
- And that it would be in our interest...
- That's enough, Colonel.

206
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,636
- ...to fold Mr. Stark...
- That's enough.

208

- We can amend the hours a little bit.

the imagery
that's connected to your report.

212
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:01,776
I believe it is somewhat premature
to reveal these images

213
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:04,070
- to the general public at this time.
- <font color="#996633"><b>STERN</b></font>: With all due respect,

for us, we'd be very grateful.

Let's have the images.

217
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:16,165
Intelligence suggests
that the devices seen in these photos

218
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:20,670
are, in fact, attempts at making
manned copies of Mr. Stark's suit.

219
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:25,842
This has been corroborated by our allies
and local intelligence on the ground,

220
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:31,013
indicating that these suits are quite
possibly, at this moment, operational.

- Now, let's see what's really going on.
- What is he doing?

If you will direct your attention
to said screens...

There's nothing more important to me
than the Expo.

- Stark is in complete disarray.

- No. Our stocks have never been higher.

318

- Yes, from a managerial standpoint.
- You are... Well, if it's messy,

- Let's see what I can get going here.
- Okay, fine.

325
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:48,497
My point is,
we have already awarded contracts

326
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,291
- to the wind farm people.
- Yeah. Don't say "wind farm."

327
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,460
- I'm already feeling gassy.
- And to the plastic plantation tree,

328
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:54,670
which was your idea, by the way.
Those people are on payroll...

329
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:56,505
- Everything was my idea.
- ...and you won't make a decision.

330
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,340
I don't care
about the liberal agenda anymore.

331

It's boring. Boring.
I'm giving you a boring alert.

332

- You do it.
- I do what?

333
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,181
Excellent idea. I just figured this out.
You run the company.

- Pepper, I need you to run the company.

335
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:09,560
- Well, stop trying to do it and do it.
- You will not

336
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,353
- give me the information...
- I'm not asking you to try...

337
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:12,521
- ...in order to...
- I'm asking you

338

339
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,691
- I am trying to do it.
- Pepper, you're not listening to me!

340
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,693
- No, you are not listening to me.
- I'm trying to make you CEO.

341
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,612
Why won't you let me?

342
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:23,199
- Have you been drinking?
- Chlorophyll.

343
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:29,371
I hereby irrevocably appoint you
chairman and CEO of Stark Industries,

effective immediately.

345
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:35,461
Yeah, done deal. Okay?

346
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:39,507
I've actually given this
a fair amount of thought,

347
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,635
believe it or not.
Doing a bit of headhunting, so to speak,

348
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:47,431
trying to figure out
who a worthy successor would be.

349
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:49,308
And then I realized...

350
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,313
it's you. It's always been you.

351
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,566
I thought there'd be a legal issue,

352
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:01,111
but actually I'm capable
of appointing my successor.

353
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,823
My successor being you.

354

Pretty decent tech.
Cycles per second were a little low.

573
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:18,296
You could have doubled up
your rotations.

You focused the repulsor energy
through ionized plasma channels.

I don't get it. A little fine tuning,
you could have made a solid paycheck.

578

Speaking of thieves,
where did you get this design?

00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:10,181
My father. Anton Vanko.

Well, I never heard of him.

588

My father is the reason you're alive.

589
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:21,276
The reason I'm alive is 'cause
you had a shot, you took it, you missed.

Did I?

591

If you can make God bleed,

592
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:31,411

And there will be blood in the water.
And the sharks will come.

The truth,
all I have to do is sit here and watch

on that track,

how you stepped up to him
in front of God and everybody,

you know, you don't just go
and try and kill the guy.

we are a lot alike in a lot of ways.

01:06:48,755 --> 01:06:51,466
Good work, Colonel.
You've made your country proud.

994
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:53,927
Thank you, sir.

995
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:03,811
That thing in your chest
is based on unfinished technology.

996
01:07:03,895 --> 01:07:05,813
No, it was finished.

997
01:07:05,897 --> 01:07:09,609
It has never been particularly effective
until I miniaturized it and put it in my...

998
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:11,361
No. Howard said the arc reactor

999
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:13,112
was the stepping-stone
to something greater.

1000
01:07:13,196 --> 01:07:17,742
He was about to kick off an energy race
that was gonna dwarf the arms race.

1001
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:21,037
He was on to something big,
something so big

1002
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,956
that it was gonna make
the nuclear reactor

1003
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:24,874
look like a triple-A battery.

1004
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:27,627
Just him,
or was Anton Vanko in on this, too?

1005
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:30,797
Anton Vanko
is the other side of that coin.

1006
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,924
Anton saw it as a way to get rich.

1007
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:35,260
When your father found out,
he had him deported.

1008
01:07:35,343 --> 01:07:37,220
When the Russians found out
he couldn't deliver,

1009
01:07:37,303 --> 01:07:39,013
they shipped his ass off to Siberia

1010
01:07:39,097 --> 01:07:41,808
and he spent the next 20 years
in a vodka-fueled rage.

1011
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:44,477
Not quite the environment
you want to raise a kid in,

1012
01:07:44,561 --> 01:07:48,731
the son you had the misfortune
of crossing paths with in Monaco.

1013
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:50,400
You told me I hadn't tried everything.

1014
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:52,610
What do you mean I haven't
tried everything? What haven't I tried?

1015
01:07:52,694 --> 01:07:57,073
He said that you were the only person
with the means and knowledge

1016
01:07:57,156 --> 01:07:59,158
to finish what he started.

1017
01:07:59,242 --> 01:08:00,827
- He said that?
- Mm-hmm.

1018
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:03,538
Are you that guy? Hmm? Are you?

1019
01:08:03,621 --> 01:08:08,918
'Cause if you are, then you can solve
the riddle of your heart.

1020
01:08:13,214 --> 01:08:14,674
I don't know
where you get your information,

1021
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:16,843
but he wasn't my biggest fan.

1022
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:18,386
What do you remember about your dad?

1023
01:08:18,469 --> 01:08:20,263
He was cold, he was calculating.

1024
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:23,099
He never told me he loved me.
He never even told me he liked me.

1025
01:08:23,182 --> 01:08:24,767
So it's a little tough for me to digest

1026
01:08:24,851 --> 01:08:27,312
when you're telling me he said
the whole future was riding on me

1027
01:08:27,395 --> 01:08:29,772
and he's passing it down.
I don't get that.

1028
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:31,691
You're talking about a guy
whose happiest day

1029
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:33,276
was when he shipped me off
to boarding school.

1030
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:34,444
That's not true.

1031
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:37,196
Well, then, clearly you knew my dad
better than I did.

1032
01:08:37,614 --> 01:08:41,284
As a matter of fact, I did. He was one of
the founding members of S.H.I.E.L.D.

1033
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:42,535
What?

1034
01:08:43,077 --> 01:08:45,163
- I got a 2:00.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1035
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:46,789
- What's this?
- Okay, you're good, right?

1036
01:08:46,873 --> 01:08:48,625
- No, I'm not good.
- You got this? Right? Right?

1037
01:08:48,708 --> 01:08:50,418
Got what? I don't even know
what I'm supposed to get.

1038
01:08:50,501 --> 01:08:53,921
Natasha will remain a floater at Stark
with her cover intact.

1039
01:08:54,005 --> 01:08:56,924
- You remember Agent Coulson, right?
- Yeah.

1040
01:08:57,342 --> 01:08:58,676
Oh, and Tony,

1041
01:09:00,053 --> 01:09:03,097
remember, I got my eye on you.

1042
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:11,981
We've disabled all communications.
No contact with the outside world.

1043
01:09:12,482 --> 01:09:13,858
Good luck.

1044
01:09:17,945 --> 01:09:19,197
Please.

1045
01:09:19,781 --> 01:09:22,992
First thing, I need a little bodywork.
I'll put in a little time at the lab.

1046
01:09:23,076 --> 01:09:25,244
If we could send one of your goon squad
down to The Coffee Bean,

1047
01:09:25,328 --> 01:09:27,914
Cross Creek, for a Starbucks run,
or something like that, that'd be nice.

1048
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:30,667
I'm not here for that.
I've been authorized by Director Fury

1049
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:33,002
to use any means necessary
to keep you on premises.

1050
01:09:33,086 --> 01:09:35,922
If you attempt to leave
or play any games,

1051
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:39,092
I will tase you and watch <font color="#00FF7F"><i>Supernanny</i></font>
while you drool into the carpet.

1052
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:41,552
- Okay?
- I think I got it, yeah.

1053
01:09:41,636 --> 01:09:43,513
Enjoy your evening's entertainment.

1054
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:14,544
- Think this is the power source?
- Major, this is not a scientific exercise.

1055
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:16,587
Let's just focus on arming it, all right?

1056
01:10:17,505 --> 01:10:18,840
Yes, sir.

1057
01:10:19,257 --> 01:10:20,550
<font color="#996633"><b>HAMMER</b></font>: Oh, yes!

1059
01:10:25,012 --> 01:10:28,266
You got it.

- Yes, it is.

1062
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:37,650
Hammer, I want to know
what you're gonna do for us.

1063
01:10:37,734 --> 01:10:39,235
What am I going to do for you?

1064
01:10:39,318 --> 01:10:42,363
Well, the first thing I'm gonna do for you
is I'm gonna upgrade your software.

1065
01:10:42,447 --> 01:10:45,450
- And then, second, I think I should...
- That's not what I'm talking about.

1066
01:10:45,533 --> 01:10:47,869
I'm talking about firepower.

1067
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:50,455
Well, you're talking to the right guy.

1068

1069

Claridge Hi-Tec,
semi-automatic, 9mm pistol.

1070
01:10:57,336 --> 01:10:59,672
Too downtown? I agree.

1071
01:11:00,214 --> 01:11:02,383
M24 shotgun, pump action.

1072
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:04,427
Five-round magazine.

1073
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:06,679
You know what? You're not a hunter.
What am I talking about?

1074
01:11:06,763 --> 01:11:07,972
I'm getting rid of it.

1075
01:11:08,055 --> 01:11:10,558
This is the FN-2000 from Belgium.

1076
01:11:10,641 --> 01:11:12,351
They do make something
better than waffles.

1077
01:11:13,728 --> 01:11:15,855
It's beautiful, but I can tell
this isn't disco enough for you,

1078
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:17,148
so I'm gonna put it right here.

1079
01:11:17,231 --> 01:11:20,443
You're looking at
a Milkor 40mm grenade launcher.

1080
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:23,362
Tear gas, smoke. Hippie control.

1081
01:11:23,738 --> 01:11:25,072
You're tough.

1082
01:11:25,156 --> 01:11:27,533
Let me tell you something.
Size does matter.

1083
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:29,285
Don't let anyone tell you different.

1084
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:32,955
This is an M1 347.62 Minigun.

1085
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:36,501
Six individual barrels.
The torso taker, powder maker.

1086
01:11:36,584 --> 01:11:38,711
Our boys in uniform call it
Uncle Gazpacho,

1087
01:11:38,795 --> 01:11:41,172
or Puff the Magic Dragon.

1088
01:11:44,175 --> 01:11:45,259
Okay.

1089
01:11:47,178 --> 01:11:50,598
These are the Cubans, baby.
These are the Cohibas, the Montecristos.

1090
01:11:52,642 --> 01:11:54,560
This is a kinetic-kill,
side-winder vehicle

1091
01:11:54,644 --> 01:11:58,815
with a secondary
cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine RDX burst.

1092
01:11:59,524 --> 01:12:03,027
It's capable of busting the bunker
under the bunker you just busted.

1093
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:05,279
If it were any smarter,
it would write a book.

1094
01:12:05,363 --> 01:12:08,699
A book that would make <font color="#00FF7F"><i>Ulysses</i></font>
look like it was written in crayon.

1095
01:12:09,367 --> 01:12:10,660
It would read it to you.

1096
01:12:11,285 --> 01:12:12,787
This is my Eiffel Tower.

1097
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:15,957
This is my Rachmaninoff's <font color="#00FF7F"><i>Third.</i></font>
My <font color="#00FF7F"><i>Pietà.</i></font>

1098
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:19,126
It's completely elegant.
It's bafflingly beautiful.

1099
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:23,923
It's capable of reducing the population
of any standing structure to zero.

1100
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:26,926
I call it the Ex-Wife.

1101
01:12:32,056 --> 01:12:33,975
That's the best I got.

1102
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:40,731
Are we gonna do this?
Give me something here.

1103
01:12:40,815 --> 01:12:44,819

1688
01:55:05,440 --> 01:55:06,566
Agreed.

Okay, here it is. Uh...

"Recruitment assessment
for Avenger Initiative. Iron Man? Yes."

1691
01:55:12,489 --> 01:55:15,075
- I gotta think about it.
- Read on.

"Not recommended"?

1694
01:55:21,832 --> 01:55:23,166
That doesn't make any sense.

Which leads us to believe
at this juncture

1700
01:55:37,639 --> 01:55:40,767
we'd only like to use you
as a consultant.

1701
01:55:47,774 --> 01:55:49,609
You can't afford me.

1702
01:55:51,945 --> 01:55:54,197
Then again,
I will waive my customary retainer

1703
01:55:54,281 --> 01:55:57,159
in exchange for a small favor.

I'll see what I can do.
