1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:03,735
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,835 --> 00:00:05,368
For 5 years, I was stranded

3
00:00:05,419 --> 00:00:07,798
on an island
with only one goal--

4
00:00:07,898 --> 00:00:09,347
survive.

5
00:00:09,349 --> 00:00:11,049
Oliver Queen is alive.

6
00:00:11,051 --> 00:00:13,585
Now I will fulfill
my father's dying wish...

7
00:00:13,587 --> 00:00:15,604
You can survive this.

8
00:00:15,606 --> 00:00:18,690
To use the list
of names he left me

9
00:00:18,692 --> 00:00:21,426
and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

10
00:00:25,097 --> 00:00:27,765
To do this, I must
become someone else.

11
00:00:27,767 --> 00:00:30,439
I must become something else.

12
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,523
<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

13
00:00:32,525 --> 00:00:34,191
How am I supposed
to stay away from you

14
00:00:34,193 --> 00:00:36,160
if you won't stay away from me?

15
00:00:36,162 --> 00:00:38,395
John Diggle. He'll be accompanying
you from now on.

16
00:00:38,397 --> 00:00:39,697
I think I'm just beginning
to understand

17
00:00:39,699 --> 00:00:41,032
the kind of man you are.

18
00:01:32,649 --> 00:01:34,951
Hey.

19
00:01:34,953 --> 00:01:37,086
Oliver?

20
00:01:42,219 --> 00:01:44,170
You're that vigilante.

21
00:01:47,675 --> 00:01:48,875
Easy, Dig.

22
00:01:48,877 --> 00:01:50,226
You were poisoned.

23
00:01:50,228 --> 00:01:51,377
Son of a bitch.

24
00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:53,096
Come on.

25
00:01:53,098 --> 00:01:54,848
Come on.

26
00:01:57,551 --> 00:01:59,352
I could have
taken you anywhere,

27
00:01:59,354 --> 00:02:01,220
could have taken you home.

28
00:02:02,523 --> 00:02:04,023
I brought you here.

29
00:02:04,942 --> 00:02:06,860
You really did lose your mind
on that island.

30
00:02:06,862 --> 00:02:08,411
Found a couple things
along the way.

31
00:02:08,413 --> 00:02:09,445
Like what, archery classes?

32
00:02:09,447 --> 00:02:10,613
Clarity.

33
00:02:12,116 --> 00:02:16,085
Starling City is dying.

34
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:21,624
It is being poisoned
by a criminal elite

35
00:02:21,626 --> 00:02:25,077
who don't care who they hurt,

36
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:27,964
as long as they maintain their
wealth and power.

37
00:02:27,966 --> 00:02:29,549
What are you gonna do,

38
00:02:29,551 --> 00:02:31,718
take 'em all down
by your lonesome?

39
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,936
No.

40
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:37,557
No, I want you to join me.

41
00:02:38,394 --> 00:02:40,427
Special Forces out of Kandahar.
It's perfect.

42
00:02:42,713 --> 00:02:46,550
- You're a fellow soldier.
- Oliver, you're not a soldier.

43
00:02:47,202 --> 00:02:48,618
You're a criminal.

44
00:02:50,621 --> 00:02:52,088
And a murderer.

45
00:02:58,593 --> 00:03:02,593
<font color=#00FF00>1x04</font>
<font color=#00FF00>An Innocent Man</font>

46
00:03:02,594 --> 00:03:04,294
Original Air Date on October 31, 2012
== sync, corrected by <font color="#00FF00">elderman</font> ==

47
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:20,450
Where were you?

48
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:22,935
What?

49
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,122
What are you doing here?

50
00:03:26,124 --> 00:03:27,273
I heard about the shooting,

51
00:03:27,275 --> 00:03:29,342
and I wanted to make sure
you were ok.

52
00:03:29,344 --> 00:03:30,560
You did?

53
00:03:30,562 --> 00:03:32,879
Yeah.

54
00:03:32,881 --> 00:03:34,247
I knocked on the door,

55
00:03:34,249 --> 00:03:36,449
and I found a family
terrified for you.

56
00:03:36,451 --> 00:03:38,284
They had no idea
where you were.

57
00:03:38,286 --> 00:03:39,252
Oh.

58
00:03:39,254 --> 00:03:41,287
Oliver, are you
so self-centered

59
00:03:41,289 --> 00:03:43,840
that you don't think that people
who care about you

60
00:03:43,842 --> 00:03:46,559
are gonna wonder where you
are after you all got shot at?

61
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:47,727
You're right.

62
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:52,265
I made peace with your
selfishness a long time ago,

63
00:03:52,267 --> 00:03:54,934
but Moira, Thea, and Walter,

64
00:03:54,936 --> 00:03:56,603
they don't deserve that.

65
00:03:56,605 --> 00:03:58,688
They deserve better,

66
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:01,524
someone who doesn't care
only about himself.

67
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,814
Laurel...

68
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,003
thank you for coming.

69
00:04:14,005 --> 00:04:17,140
I care about the lives
of other people, Oliver.

70
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:20,660
Maybe you should
try it sometime.

71
00:04:27,384 --> 00:04:29,219
Oh, man.

72
00:04:30,438 --> 00:04:32,188
That was harsh.

73
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:36,159
You ok?

74
00:04:36,161 --> 00:04:37,610
Sure.

75
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:41,681
Second time tonight
that a friend of mine

76
00:04:41,683 --> 00:04:44,250
has taken me to the woodshed.

77
00:04:44,252 --> 00:04:46,369
Kind of tires you out.

78
00:04:46,371 --> 00:04:47,370
Yeah.

79
00:04:47,372 --> 00:04:49,372
Good night.
Good night.

80
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:16,182
Shengcún.

81
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:19,986
What am I supposed
to do with that?

82
00:05:19,988 --> 00:05:21,821
Shengcún.

83
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,657
Does that mean "bird"?

84
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:26,576
Shengcún!

85
00:05:26,578 --> 00:05:28,495
I don't speak Chinese!

86
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:40,056
I'm sorry, Laurel.

87
00:05:40,058 --> 00:05:41,457
I'm so sorry.

88
00:05:47,378 --> 00:05:49,863
There were
no signs of forced entry

89
00:05:49,865 --> 00:05:51,632
or any evidence of a struggle,

90
00:05:51,634 --> 00:05:53,353
but, hours later, the police found
that the bloodstained

91
00:05:53,378 --> 00:05:55,130
kitchen knife in the trunk...

92
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,312
Couldn't sleep, either?

93
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,197
No.
Forensic analysis verified...

94
00:05:58,199 --> 00:05:59,482
What are you watching?

95
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,467
Peter Declan.
Blood on the blade...

96
00:06:01,469 --> 00:06:02,602
Hmm?
Peter Declan's fingerprints...

97
00:06:02,604 --> 00:06:04,520
A guy who killed his wife.

98
00:06:04,522 --> 00:06:06,188
Despite the growing
list of evidence...

99
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,190
Right. This guy
killed his wife

100
00:06:08,192 --> 00:06:11,577
in their baby's room.
Psycho.

101
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,346
Camille was everything to me.

102
00:06:13,348 --> 00:06:16,816
I couldn't kill her any more than I
could kill myself.

103
00:06:16,818 --> 00:06:18,835
So why can't you sleep?

104
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,421
Bad dreams.

105
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:23,089
About?

106
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,174
Laurel.

107
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,727
So why don't you make a play?

108
00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:30,146
I mean, she did come over here

109
00:06:30,148 --> 00:06:32,048
just to make sure
you didn't get shot.

110
00:06:33,383 --> 00:06:34,767
There are reasons.

111
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,319
Mm, what are they?

112
00:06:36,321 --> 00:06:38,988
Besides you sleeping
with her sister

113
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,356
and her sister dying

114
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,358
and her father hating your guts

115
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,160
and you basically being a jerk

116
00:06:44,162 --> 00:06:46,479
to everybody since
you've been back?

117
00:06:46,481 --> 00:06:49,232
Those are the top ones.

118
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:57,040
I know that it might not seem
like it sometimes, but...

119
00:06:59,993 --> 00:07:03,046
I'm not the same person
I used to be.

120
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:04,764
So show her.

121
00:07:04,766 --> 00:07:06,816
Be yourself.

122
00:07:06,818 --> 00:07:09,552
I mean your new self.

123
00:07:20,263 --> 00:07:22,115
How did you sleep?

124
00:07:22,117 --> 00:07:24,367
Just fine.
Thank you.

125
00:07:25,652 --> 00:07:26,769
We have a visitor.

126
00:07:26,771 --> 00:07:29,956
Hmm. Mr. Diggle's
replacement.

127
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:32,992
Replacement?

128
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:37,163
Yes. He tendered
his resignation this morning.

129
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,715
Did he say why?

130
00:07:38,717 --> 00:07:41,801
He said he didn't approve of the way
you spend your evenings,

131
00:07:41,803 --> 00:07:44,604
particularly given that they always begin
with you ditching him.

132
00:07:46,106 --> 00:07:47,256
Hi.

133
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,808
Mr. Queen,
Rob Scott.

134
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,593
I'll be your new body man.

135
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,128
That's a firm grip
you got there, Rob.

136
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:54,647
That's 5 years SWAT
with Monument Point M.C.U.

137
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:56,799
I feel safer already.

138
00:07:56,801 --> 00:07:59,328
Ah, thank God we
don't have to hear about

139
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:01,353
this awful man anymore.

140
00:08:03,023 --> 00:08:07,276
Declan's execution is set for
midnight 2 days from now.

141
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,078
Camille Declan's
former employer,

142
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,382
Jason Brodeur, released
a statement saying, quote,

143
00:08:12,383 --> 00:08:15,892
"I hope this gives Camille
the peace she deserves."

144
00:08:15,893 --> 00:08:17,442
Jason Brodeur?

145
00:08:18,296 --> 00:08:19,462
What?

146
00:08:19,464 --> 00:08:22,449
The dead wife worked
for Jason Brodeur.

147
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:24,504
Apparently so. What--

148
00:08:24,677 --> 00:08:25,676
why?

149
00:08:25,678 --> 00:08:27,177
No reason.

150
00:08:27,179 --> 00:08:28,712
Say, Rob, I want
to go into town.

151
00:08:28,714 --> 00:08:30,264
Could you please
get the car for me?

152
00:08:30,266 --> 00:08:31,298
No offense,
Mr. Queen,

153
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,550
but I have been filled in
on your tendency

154
00:08:33,552 --> 00:08:34,835
to slip the leash.

155
00:08:34,837 --> 00:08:36,336
If it's all the same to you,
I'd prefer

156
00:08:36,338 --> 00:08:37,855
keeping you in my sights
at all times.

157
00:08:39,641 --> 00:08:41,775
We're 20 miles from the city.

158
00:08:41,777 --> 00:08:43,844
If you don't drive me,

159
00:08:43,846 --> 00:08:45,779
how else am I gonna get there?

160
00:08:47,365 --> 00:08:48,616
Right?

161
00:08:54,022 --> 00:08:55,623
I like him.

162
00:09:04,332 --> 00:09:05,833
Hey!

163
00:09:10,588 --> 00:09:14,808
They say Peter Declan
murdered his wife in cold blood.

164
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:17,094
He had no alibi,

165
00:09:17,096 --> 00:09:19,430
and all the evidence
pointed toward him.

166
00:09:19,432 --> 00:09:23,150
He was tried, convicted,
and sentenced to death,

167
00:09:23,152 --> 00:09:24,935
an open-and-shut case,

168
00:09:24,937 --> 00:09:27,054
except for one thing.

169
00:09:27,056 --> 00:09:30,240
Declan's wife Camille
worked for Jason Brodeur.

170
00:09:30,242 --> 00:09:33,661
And Jason Brodeur
is on the list.

171
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,900
Mr. Brodeur.

172
00:09:39,902 --> 00:09:41,201
Admiring your handiwork?

173
00:09:43,237 --> 00:09:46,073
You should have just let me
kill both of 'em.

174
00:09:46,075 --> 00:09:47,758
Peter Declan is
worth more alive.

175
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,594
"Husband kills wife" is
a much better headline

176
00:09:50,596 --> 00:09:54,048
than "whistle-blower uncovers
toxic dumping," don't you think?

177
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:56,300
Either way, 48 hours,

178
00:09:56,302 --> 00:10:02,606
all this'll be over.

179
00:10:02,608 --> 00:10:05,592
The odds are good that
Brodeur is involved in this woman's murder,

180
00:10:05,594 --> 00:10:09,613
which means an innocent man
is facing execution.

181
00:10:09,615 --> 00:10:12,199
He'll need a good attorney.

182
00:10:13,201 --> 00:10:15,202
So I take it there's
absolutely no point

183
00:10:15,204 --> 00:10:17,788
in asking if you'd
like to grab a drink?

184
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:21,291
I can't. I have to go over transcripts
for the Fernands case.

185
00:10:21,293 --> 00:10:24,495
You know, if you go somewhere
that's not work or your home,

186
00:10:24,497 --> 00:10:27,715
your odds of meeting someone
increase by, like, a gazillion percent.

187
00:10:27,717 --> 00:10:28,665
Oh, that's not true.

188
00:10:28,667 --> 00:10:30,951
I could still get mugged
on the way home.

189
00:10:30,953 --> 00:10:33,971
In that case, I hope
he's cute and single.

190
00:10:33,973 --> 00:10:36,306
Good night, Joanna.

191
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,617
Hello, Laurel.

192
00:11:11,318 --> 00:11:12,685
Don't move!

193
00:11:14,738 --> 00:11:15,904
I'm not gonna hurt you.

194
00:11:15,906 --> 00:11:18,273
Stay back.
My father's a cop.

195
00:11:18,275 --> 00:11:19,858
You are making a huge mistake.

196
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,027
I'm not the person
you think I am,

197
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:23,495
and I need your help.

198
00:11:23,497 --> 00:11:25,948
Peter Declan is gonna
be executed in 48 hours.

199
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,333
I think he's innocent.

200
00:11:27,335 --> 00:11:30,619
Declan's wife was gonna blow
the whistle on Jason Brodeur.

201
00:11:30,621 --> 00:11:31,903
Brodeur had her murdered.

202
00:11:31,905 --> 00:11:35,074
There are a thousand lawyers
in Starling City.

203
00:11:35,076 --> 00:11:36,675
Why me?

204
00:11:41,097 --> 00:11:42,931
We're both trying to help.

205
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:46,518
What makes you sure
I'm gonna help you?

206
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,421
Because I know
you'd do anything

207
00:11:49,423 --> 00:11:52,024
to save the life
of an innocent man.

208
00:12:05,573 --> 00:12:08,624
A jury has charged you
as guilty, Mr. Declan.

209
00:12:08,626 --> 00:12:10,492
The evidence was
stacked against me,

210
00:12:10,494 --> 00:12:12,211
but I didn't kill my wife.

211
00:12:12,213 --> 00:12:15,614
I didn't take my daughter's
mother from her.

212
00:12:17,617 --> 00:12:19,802
The murder weapon was a knife

213
00:12:19,804 --> 00:12:23,222
from your kitchen
with your prints on it.

214
00:12:23,224 --> 00:12:25,457
It was found,
along with Camille's blood,

215
00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:27,493
in the trunk of your car.

216
00:12:27,495 --> 00:12:30,229
Your neighbors said they heard
an argument that night.

217
00:12:30,231 --> 00:12:33,899
We had a knockdown fight
over Jason Brodeur.

218
00:12:33,901 --> 00:12:35,317
Camille worked for him,

219
00:12:35,319 --> 00:12:39,071
and his company had been
dumping toxic waste into the Glades.

220
00:12:39,073 --> 00:12:42,341
Now, Camille told me that she'd
gone and told a supervisor about it.

221
00:12:42,343 --> 00:12:44,743
I was afraid for
my family's safety.

222
00:12:44,745 --> 00:12:47,613
And we argued

223
00:12:47,615 --> 00:12:50,482
very loudly, yes.

224
00:12:50,484 --> 00:12:51,467
Izzy started crying,

225
00:12:51,469 --> 00:12:55,003
so Camille went and
stayed in her room.

226
00:13:02,328 --> 00:13:04,480
In the morning,
I went to apologize,

227
00:13:04,482 --> 00:13:08,050
and that's when I found her.

228
00:13:09,335 --> 00:13:11,386
So I just grabbed Izzy,

229
00:13:11,388 --> 00:13:14,640
and I ran outside,
and I called 911.

230
00:13:19,062 --> 00:13:21,730
I'm innocent,
Ms. Lance.

231
00:13:26,035 --> 00:13:27,786
Well, it looks
like someone forgot

232
00:13:27,788 --> 00:13:29,788
a lunch date with his wife.

233
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,073
What do you mean?

234
00:13:31,075 --> 00:13:32,624
Lunch isn't
for another--

235
00:13:34,193 --> 00:13:36,078
45 minutes ago.
I'm so sorry.

236
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,047
It's all right. The restaurant
is holding our table.

237
00:13:39,049 --> 00:13:40,916
Is there something wrong?

238
00:13:40,918 --> 00:13:43,335
Compliance department
has tagged something,

239
00:13:43,337 --> 00:13:44,920
$2.6 million withdrawal

240
00:13:44,922 --> 00:13:47,256
from one of our
Vancouver subsidiaries.

241
00:13:47,258 --> 00:13:49,708
What--you mean--
are you saying that someone

242
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,844
embezzled $2.6 million
from the company?

243
00:13:51,846 --> 00:13:53,679
Well, it's probably
a bookkeeping error,

244
00:13:53,681 --> 00:13:55,147
but compliance
is understandably

245
00:13:55,149 --> 00:13:56,982
worried about an IRS audit.

246
00:13:56,984 --> 00:13:58,233
Hmm.

247
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,487
But don't worry.

248
00:14:01,489 --> 00:14:03,522
I'm sure it's nothing.
Come on.

249
00:14:03,524 --> 00:14:05,807
We're gonna be late.

250
00:14:05,809 --> 00:14:07,225
On our way.

251
00:14:08,661 --> 00:14:10,946
Well, I wasn't
the lead on this,

252
00:14:10,948 --> 00:14:13,615
but from what I recall,
we had fingerprints.

253
00:14:13,617 --> 00:14:16,919
We had blood.
We got motive, everything.

254
00:14:18,621 --> 00:14:20,956
Brodeur seems
like the type of guy

255
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:23,074
with resources
needed to frame someone.

256
00:14:23,076 --> 00:14:26,357
Laurel, in 24 hours,
Peter Declan is lying down

257
00:14:26,358 --> 00:14:28,177
with a needle in his arm,
and he's not getting up.

258
00:14:28,349 --> 00:14:30,098
If I thought for a second we didn't
have the right guy,

259
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,767
do you think there's anything
else I'd be doing right now

260
00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:33,769
except trying to get at
what really happened?

261
00:14:33,771 --> 00:14:36,438
Declan said his wife
went to her supervisor

262
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,408
with allegations that Brodeur was
dumping toxic waste.

263
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:41,760
Yeah, but that supervisor,

264
00:14:41,762 --> 00:14:43,228
he said that never happened.

265
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,147
Let me see.
What was his name?

266
00:14:45,149 --> 00:14:46,815
Here you go.
Istook, Matt Istook.

267
00:14:46,817 --> 00:14:49,234
He said he didn't even
see Camille that day.

268
00:14:50,537 --> 00:14:51,703
Happy now?

269
00:14:51,705 --> 00:14:52,905
Yes.

270
00:14:55,074 --> 00:14:57,743
You know, I thought
it'd be a cold day in hell

271
00:14:57,745 --> 00:14:58,961
before you started
defending criminals.

272
00:14:58,963 --> 00:15:01,713
I'm not so sure
Declan's a criminal.

273
00:15:01,715 --> 00:15:04,115
Like you said, he's on a clock.

274
00:15:04,117 --> 00:15:06,301
Can't leave any stone unturned.

275
00:15:09,005 --> 00:15:10,756
Oh, yeah.

276
00:15:16,496 --> 00:15:17,930
So when are you gonna tell me?

277
00:15:17,932 --> 00:15:18,897
Hmm?

278
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:21,116
About what happened
to your arm.

279
00:15:21,118 --> 00:15:22,935
Oh, it's my shoulder,

280
00:15:22,937 --> 00:15:24,186
and it's--it's fine.

281
00:15:24,188 --> 00:15:26,154
I knew that Queen guy
was trouble.

282
00:15:26,156 --> 00:15:28,590
Hey, I never said this happened
protecting Queen.

283
00:15:30,276 --> 00:15:31,309
Oh, yeah?

284
00:15:31,311 --> 00:15:33,445
Then what's he doing here?

285
00:15:36,783 --> 00:15:38,817
Area is secure, sir.

286
00:15:38,819 --> 00:15:40,652
Thank you very much, Rob.

287
00:15:42,288 --> 00:15:46,208
Hello, Diggle's
sister-in-law Carly.

288
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:48,176
I'm Oliver Queen.
I know who you are.

289
00:15:48,178 --> 00:15:50,879
No, you really don't.

290
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:55,500
Hello.

291
00:15:58,388 --> 00:15:59,805
I couldn't help but notice

292
00:15:59,807 --> 00:16:02,524
a distinct lack of police cars
when I got home.

293
00:16:02,526 --> 00:16:04,910
I knew you wouldn't
drop a dime on me.

294
00:16:04,912 --> 00:16:07,479
So have you
considered my offer?

295
00:16:07,481 --> 00:16:08,680
Offer.

296
00:16:08,682 --> 00:16:10,582
That's one hell
of a way to put it.

297
00:16:10,584 --> 00:16:11,733
It is an offer.

298
00:16:11,735 --> 00:16:14,469
It's a chance to do
the kind of good

299
00:16:14,471 --> 00:16:16,655
that compelled you
to join the military.

300
00:16:16,657 --> 00:16:18,023
Please.

301
00:16:18,025 --> 00:16:21,043
You were born with a platinum spoon
in your mouth, Queen.

302
00:16:21,045 --> 00:16:24,362
What, you spent 5 years on an island
with no room service,

303
00:16:24,364 --> 00:16:26,665
and suddenly you
found religion?

304
00:16:28,868 --> 00:16:30,752
This was my father's.

305
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,427
I found it when I buried him.

306
00:16:39,646 --> 00:16:41,897
I thought you said your father
died when the boat went down.

307
00:16:41,899 --> 00:16:43,398
We both made it to a life raft,

308
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,733
but there wasn't enough
food and water

309
00:16:44,735 --> 00:16:47,102
for both of us,
so he shot himself in the head.

310
00:16:47,987 --> 00:16:50,022
And as much as he was doing it

311
00:16:50,024 --> 00:16:51,740
to give me a chance to survive,

312
00:16:51,742 --> 00:16:54,142
I believe that he
was also atoning for his sins.

313
00:16:54,144 --> 00:16:58,664
I need to right
the wrongs done by my family,

314
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:01,500
and I'm offering you the chance

315
00:17:01,502 --> 00:17:03,835
to right the wrongs
done to yours.

316
00:17:03,837 --> 00:17:05,570
Oliver, what are
you talking about?

317
00:17:05,572 --> 00:17:07,122
The police never caught
your brother's shooter.

318
00:17:07,124 --> 00:17:08,740
Hey, you leave Andy
out of this.

319
00:17:08,742 --> 00:17:10,792
The bullets were laced
with curare.

320
00:17:10,794 --> 00:17:12,110
That's
Floyd Lawton's M.O.

321
00:17:12,112 --> 00:17:16,581
He is the sniper
that I stopped.

322
00:17:17,684 --> 00:17:19,017
Are you trying to tell me

323
00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:20,385
that you took down
Andy's killer?

324
00:17:20,387 --> 00:17:24,156
I'm--I'm giving you
the chance,

325
00:17:24,158 --> 00:17:28,377
a chance to help
other people's families.

326
00:17:28,379 --> 00:17:30,395
Do you remember when the people

327
00:17:30,397 --> 00:17:33,065
in this city helped each other?

328
00:17:33,067 --> 00:17:34,816
They can't do that anymore,

329
00:17:34,818 --> 00:17:37,703
because a group of people,

330
00:17:37,705 --> 00:17:40,222
people like my father,

331
00:17:40,224 --> 00:17:43,441
they see nothing wrong
with raising themselves up

332
00:17:43,443 --> 00:17:46,495
by stepping on
other people's throats.

333
00:17:46,497 --> 00:17:48,246
It does need to stop,

334
00:17:48,248 --> 00:17:50,799
and if it's not
gonna be the courts

335
00:17:50,801 --> 00:17:53,018
and it's not gonna
be the cops...

336
00:17:54,921 --> 00:17:56,838
Then it's gonna be me.

337
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,961
And, I hope, you.

338
00:18:06,733 --> 00:18:09,267
I'm gonna go
to the washroom, Rob.

339
00:18:21,647 --> 00:18:23,749
Oh, that boy's long gone, man.

340
00:18:23,751 --> 00:18:25,417
Phew.

341
00:18:27,286 --> 00:18:29,254
You still following
the money trail?

342
00:18:29,256 --> 00:18:29,846
Mm-hmm.

343
00:18:29,871 --> 00:18:31,674
Don't we have accountants
for that sort of thing?

344
00:18:31,675 --> 00:18:34,325
They're being singularly ineffective
in this instance.

345
00:18:34,327 --> 00:18:36,094
Well, then...

346
00:18:36,096 --> 00:18:38,964
it's fortunate that
I've solved the mystery.

347
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:43,185
I think I'm the culprit.

348
00:18:43,187 --> 00:18:46,271
2.6 million is
a rather specific figure.

349
00:18:46,273 --> 00:18:48,723
That's the exact amount
the company invested

350
00:18:48,725 --> 00:18:51,827
in a friend's start-up venture
3 years ago.

351
00:18:53,363 --> 00:18:55,680
I will call accounting.
They'll clean it all up.

352
00:18:55,682 --> 00:18:57,215
Then there's nothing
to worry about.

353
00:18:57,217 --> 00:18:59,317
Ok.
Heh.

354
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:11,346
You really are putting a lot of hours
into this Declan thing.

355
00:19:11,348 --> 00:19:12,864
You actually think
he's innocent.

356
00:19:12,866 --> 00:19:13,865
Someone does.

357
00:19:13,867 --> 00:19:15,200
So you said,

358
00:19:15,202 --> 00:19:17,803
but you didn't say who.

359
00:19:25,878 --> 00:19:27,646
The guardian angel.

360
00:19:28,547 --> 00:19:31,382
The guy in the hood?

361
00:19:31,384 --> 00:19:32,734
Look, you're--
you're kidding.

362
00:19:32,736 --> 00:19:35,353
He tracked me down and asked me
to look into the Declan case.

363
00:19:35,355 --> 00:19:36,521
But you've met him?

364
00:19:36,523 --> 00:19:38,106
But he goes against everything

365
00:19:38,108 --> 00:19:40,575
that I was ever taught
to believe in.

366
00:19:40,577 --> 00:19:43,328
He breaks the law
and God knows what else.

367
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:45,152
How are you not afraid
that he is gonna do

368
00:19:45,177 --> 00:19:46,365
God knows what to you?

369
00:19:46,366 --> 00:19:47,999
He won't.

370
00:19:48,001 --> 00:19:49,835
I don't know.
I can feel it.

371
00:19:49,837 --> 00:19:52,003
You know, when I told you
to meet someone,

372
00:19:52,005 --> 00:19:54,322
this is far, far away
from what I meant.

373
00:19:58,711 --> 00:20:01,463
I got your message.

374
00:20:01,465 --> 00:20:05,183
Is there a reason
we can't do this face to face?

375
00:20:05,185 --> 00:20:06,885
You've met with Peter Declan.

376
00:20:06,887 --> 00:20:08,803
You were right.

377
00:20:10,139 --> 00:20:12,440
He might be innocent.

378
00:20:12,442 --> 00:20:14,759
Declan said his wife
blew the whistle on Brodeur

379
00:20:14,761 --> 00:20:16,111
the day she was murdered.

380
00:20:16,113 --> 00:20:17,768
Then we need to get whoever

381
00:20:17,793 --> 00:20:19,941
she told about
Brodeur to testify.

382
00:20:21,401 --> 00:20:23,768
He already has.

383
00:20:25,104 --> 00:20:28,273
Matt Istook,
Camille's supervisor.

384
00:20:28,275 --> 00:20:32,110
Only, he says that she didn't say
a word to him.

385
00:20:32,112 --> 00:20:33,211
He could be lying.

386
00:20:33,213 --> 00:20:36,447
Well, if he is,
then he's very convincing.

387
00:20:36,449 --> 00:20:39,084
He had the jury
and police believing him.

388
00:20:39,086 --> 00:20:41,670
He hasn't been
questioned by me.

389
00:20:43,556 --> 00:20:45,223
I didn't become a lawyer

390
00:20:45,225 --> 00:20:47,842
to break the law
or hurt anybody.

391
00:20:47,844 --> 00:20:49,561
I do what's necessary,

392
00:20:49,563 --> 00:20:52,463
what people
like Peter Declan need.

393
00:20:53,766 --> 00:20:56,851
If what you're doing
isn't wrong...

394
00:20:56,853 --> 00:21:00,322
Then why are you
hiding your face with a hood?

395
00:21:01,557 --> 00:21:04,025
To protect the ones
I care about.

396
00:21:05,161 --> 00:21:07,279
That sounds lonely.

397
00:21:07,281 --> 00:21:08,813
It can be.

398
00:21:10,316 --> 00:21:13,084
But not today.

399
00:21:31,495 --> 00:21:33,346
I've got one question.

400
00:21:33,348 --> 00:21:35,048
Why am I being fired?

401
00:21:35,883 --> 00:21:37,183
Ms. Smoak, isn't it?
Yes.

402
00:21:37,185 --> 00:21:39,018
And I am without a doubt

403
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,938
the single most valuable member
of your technical division.

404
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,773
That's including
my so-called "supervisor."

405
00:21:43,775 --> 00:21:47,677
Letting me go would be a major
error for this company.

406
00:21:48,646 --> 00:21:51,731
I agree, which is why you're
not being fired.

407
00:21:51,733 --> 00:21:54,784
Uh, I assumed when
you brought me up here,

408
00:21:54,786 --> 00:21:56,002
it was because...

409
00:21:57,354 --> 00:22:00,106
It's because I wanted
you to look into something for me.

410
00:22:01,709 --> 00:22:04,243
A variance
of $2.6 million

411
00:22:04,245 --> 00:22:06,145
on a failed investment
from 3 years ago.

412
00:22:06,147 --> 00:22:07,597
It was authorized by my wife.

413
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:09,365
I was hoping you could find out

414
00:22:09,367 --> 00:22:11,751
some of the details
of the transaction for me.

415
00:22:11,753 --> 00:22:12,769
Find out...

416
00:22:12,771 --> 00:22:15,371
Dig up discreetly.

417
00:22:16,507 --> 00:22:17,974
I'm your girl.

418
00:22:21,545 --> 00:22:22,845
I mean, I'm not your girl.

419
00:22:22,847 --> 00:22:25,231
I wasn't making a pass at you.

420
00:22:27,267 --> 00:22:29,769
Thank you for not firing me.

421
00:22:38,195 --> 00:22:39,895
Ahh.

422
00:22:42,449 --> 00:22:43,833
What the...

423
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:54,260
Matt Istook.

424
00:22:56,913 --> 00:22:58,765
You're him, that hood guy.

425
00:22:58,767 --> 00:23:01,217
You're the guy
that's been terrorizing the city.

426
00:23:01,219 --> 00:23:02,185
Peter Declan,

427
00:23:02,187 --> 00:23:03,970
your lies helped
put him on death row.

428
00:23:03,972 --> 00:23:06,756
Now, either it's time
to tell me the truth,

429
00:23:06,758 --> 00:23:09,559
or it's time
for the 10:15 to Blüdhaven.

430
00:23:09,561 --> 00:23:11,027
O-ok.

431
00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:13,429
Ok, I--
Brodeur paid me to--

432
00:23:13,431 --> 00:23:15,698
to say that Camille
never spoke to me,

433
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,984
but I didn't have anything to do
with her death.

434
00:23:17,986 --> 00:23:20,536
Oh, God, please.
I'll do anything.

435
00:23:20,538 --> 00:23:21,587
Y-you could
have the file.

436
00:23:21,589 --> 00:23:23,322
What file?
Camille gave me a file

437
00:23:23,324 --> 00:23:25,291
of evidence
against Jason Brodeur.

438
00:23:25,293 --> 00:23:26,743
Where is it?!
Let me go,

439
00:23:26,745 --> 00:23:27,744
and I'll tell you.

440
00:23:30,331 --> 00:23:32,715
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!
Don't go! It's in my desk!

441
00:23:32,717 --> 00:23:34,467
The file, it's in my desk
at the office!

442
00:23:34,469 --> 00:23:36,002
You can have it!
Get me out of here!

443
00:23:48,131 --> 00:23:49,482
What is that?

444
00:23:49,484 --> 00:23:51,967
I'm so hungry.

445
00:23:55,072 --> 00:23:56,989
It smells really good.

446
00:23:58,358 --> 00:23:59,826
Aah!

447
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:04,030
Hey, fine. Don't share.

448
00:24:10,505 --> 00:24:12,705
Shengcún.

449
00:24:20,764 --> 00:24:22,998
I'm not gonna kill the bird.

450
00:24:25,719 --> 00:24:27,386
Shengcún.

451
00:24:44,905 --> 00:24:47,540
Compliments
of Matt Istook.

452
00:24:47,542 --> 00:24:48,941
What's in here?

453
00:24:48,943 --> 00:24:51,911
Leverage on Jason Brodeur,

454
00:24:51,913 --> 00:24:54,196
enough to help save
Peter Declan's life.

455
00:24:54,198 --> 00:24:58,050
As an attorney, I never would have
gotten a file like this.

456
00:24:58,052 --> 00:25:01,721
I always thought the law was sacred,
i-it fixed everything.

457
00:25:01,723 --> 00:25:03,756
And now, Laurel?

458
00:25:03,758 --> 00:25:05,591
Now what do you think?

459
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,544
I think there's
too many people in this city

460
00:25:08,546 --> 00:25:10,479
who only care
about themselves...

461
00:25:12,149 --> 00:25:14,567
people who are selfish.

462
00:25:14,569 --> 00:25:16,903
I think they need
someone who cares

463
00:25:16,905 --> 00:25:19,105
about the lives
of other people...

464
00:25:21,525 --> 00:25:22,742
someone like you.

465
00:25:22,744 --> 00:25:28,047
♪ God, give me your shelter ♪

466
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:45,131
Oh, my God.

467
00:25:45,133 --> 00:25:46,682
What is wrong with your face?

468
00:25:46,684 --> 00:25:47,633
What do you mean?

469
00:25:47,635 --> 00:25:50,169
There's something
really weird on it,

470
00:25:50,171 --> 00:25:52,021
like this thing
with your mouth.

471
00:25:52,023 --> 00:25:55,107
It--it looks like
it's in the shape of a smile.

472
00:25:55,109 --> 00:25:56,893
That's cute.
So why are you grinning?

473
00:25:56,895 --> 00:25:59,528
I took your advice with Laurel

474
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:01,297
to be myself.

475
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:02,949
And...

476
00:26:02,951 --> 00:26:03,983
It's helping.

477
00:26:03,985 --> 00:26:06,619
Got mad relationship
skills, bro.

478
00:26:06,621 --> 00:26:09,322
Let me know if you
need trendy places to propose.

479
00:26:09,324 --> 00:26:11,123
I think you're getting
a little bit ahead of yourself.

480
00:26:11,125 --> 00:26:12,325
Mm.
Little bit.

481
00:26:15,078 --> 00:26:16,545
Rob.

482
00:26:18,048 --> 00:26:19,448
You gotta keep up.

483
00:26:31,345 --> 00:26:32,979
Hey, you look busy.

484
00:26:32,981 --> 00:26:35,064
Is that the Declan case?

485
00:26:35,066 --> 00:26:38,034
You know, it was a funny
development on Matt Istook.

486
00:26:38,036 --> 00:26:39,352
He, uh, filed a police report.

487
00:26:39,354 --> 00:26:41,187
He said the hood
harassed him last night.

488
00:26:41,189 --> 00:26:42,655
And that's funny,

489
00:26:42,657 --> 00:26:44,240
because I gave
my daughter Istook's name.

490
00:26:44,242 --> 00:26:46,575
Dad--
He's a vigilante.

491
00:26:46,577 --> 00:26:47,860
He's a damn criminal,

492
00:26:47,862 --> 00:26:50,529
and you working with him,
that makes you an accessory.

493
00:26:50,531 --> 00:26:52,531
I am trying to save
an innocent man's life.

494
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,534
No.

495
00:26:55,536 --> 00:26:57,370
You're breaking the law.

496
00:26:57,372 --> 00:26:58,921
Well, I wouldn't
have to if the police

497
00:26:58,923 --> 00:27:01,123
would have done
their job right in the first place.

498
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:05,628
I asked you
how you got this case.

499
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:08,514
You lied to me
straight to my face, eh?

500
00:27:10,267 --> 00:27:12,518
I thought you and I
didn't do that.

501
00:27:14,021 --> 00:27:15,771
Guess I was wrong.

502
00:27:19,543 --> 00:27:21,527
The mere existence of the file

503
00:27:21,529 --> 00:27:23,846
proves that Mr. Istook
perjured himself

504
00:27:23,848 --> 00:27:26,115
for Jason Brodeur's benefit.

505
00:27:26,117 --> 00:27:27,349
That's slander.

506
00:27:27,351 --> 00:27:28,651
Jared Swanstrom, Your Honor.

507
00:27:28,653 --> 00:27:31,120
I represent Jason Brodeur
and Brodeur Chemical.

508
00:27:31,122 --> 00:27:34,023
The interest of justice
requires you

509
00:27:34,025 --> 00:27:36,025
to stay the defendant's
execution

510
00:27:36,027 --> 00:27:38,577
pending exploration of the
newly discovered evidence.

511
00:27:38,579 --> 00:27:41,380
Ours isn't a court of justice,
Ms. Lance.

512
00:27:41,382 --> 00:27:42,531
It's a court of law,

513
00:27:42,533 --> 00:27:44,583
and under the law,
I don't think your evidence

514
00:27:44,585 --> 00:27:47,420
is sufficient to warrant
a stay of execution.

515
00:27:47,422 --> 00:27:50,473
Your motion for habeas corpus
is denied.

516
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,560
This isn't over.

517
00:27:54,562 --> 00:27:56,095
I've got the loose end now,

518
00:27:56,097 --> 00:27:57,430
and no matter what happens,

519
00:27:57,432 --> 00:28:00,433
I am going to pull on it until
your whole world unravels.

520
00:28:02,269 --> 00:28:04,854
Declan's lawyer's
pulling me into this.

521
00:28:04,856 --> 00:28:05,988
I'm gonna go to prison,

522
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:07,323
if not for murder,

523
00:28:07,325 --> 00:28:08,824
then this--
this dumping thing.

524
00:28:08,826 --> 00:28:09,792
That won't happen.

525
00:28:09,794 --> 00:28:11,327
There are steps we can take.

526
00:28:11,329 --> 00:28:13,395
You saw her.
She's going after me.

527
00:28:13,397 --> 00:28:15,664
She's gonna want
to meet with her client

528
00:28:15,666 --> 00:28:17,166
after what happened
in court today.

529
00:28:17,168 --> 00:28:19,568
We have friends
up in Iron Heights.

530
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:22,404
Prison can be
a dangerous place.

531
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:31,568
We're not done yet.

532
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:33,069
I'm an attorney.

533
00:28:33,071 --> 00:28:35,572
Trust me.
We're done.

534
00:28:36,674 --> 00:28:39,760
What do you need
to free Peter Declan?

535
00:28:39,762 --> 00:28:41,762
At this point,

536
00:28:41,764 --> 00:28:44,914
nothing short of a signed
confession from Brodeur.

537
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:47,017
Where are you going?

538
00:28:47,019 --> 00:28:48,602
To get a confession.

539
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:51,755
The company Mrs. Queen--

540
00:28:51,757 --> 00:28:53,340
or Steele.

541
00:28:53,342 --> 00:28:54,975
Mrs. Queen-Steele.

542
00:28:54,977 --> 00:28:56,092
She hyphenate?

543
00:28:56,094 --> 00:28:57,861
She seems like a woman
who would hyphenate.

544
00:28:59,949 --> 00:29:01,064
Right.

545
00:29:01,066 --> 00:29:03,667
The company she invested in
doesn't exist.

546
00:29:03,669 --> 00:29:05,035
I don't understand.

547
00:29:05,037 --> 00:29:07,204
There was no investment.
The money was used

548
00:29:07,206 --> 00:29:09,289
to set up an offshore
LLC called Tempest.

549
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:11,792
I don't recall that name being under
the Queen Consolidated banner.

550
00:29:11,794 --> 00:29:13,126
'Cause it's not.

551
00:29:13,128 --> 00:29:15,128
There's nothing registered with
the Secretary of State,

552
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:16,380
no federal tax records,

553
00:29:16,382 --> 00:29:17,948
no patent applications filed.

554
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:22,970
But in 2009, Tempest purchased
a warehouse in Starling City.

555
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,427
Enough moping.

556
00:29:30,429 --> 00:29:31,428
Mm.

557
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:33,480
You quit. It's done.

558
00:29:33,482 --> 00:29:35,816
My advice would be to move on.

559
00:29:35,818 --> 00:29:38,518
Well, if it were
only that easy.

560
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,486
Except it is.

561
00:29:39,488 --> 00:29:41,154
Personal security is dangerous.

562
00:29:41,156 --> 00:29:42,639
Your nephew already
lost his father.

563
00:29:42,641 --> 00:29:45,025
He can't lose his uncle, too.

564
00:29:46,494 --> 00:29:48,128
Does it ever bother you

565
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:50,980
they never caught
the guy who killed Andy?

566
00:29:53,551 --> 00:29:55,652
You know, when I was
in Afghanistan,

567
00:29:55,654 --> 00:29:58,538
I had a job, and I did it.

568
00:29:59,874 --> 00:30:01,008
And when I could,

569
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:02,626
I would help out
the people there

570
00:30:02,628 --> 00:30:04,661
so that, in some small way,
when I left,

571
00:30:04,663 --> 00:30:07,214
I could believe I left it
a better place.

572
00:30:08,549 --> 00:30:10,550
But ever since I've been home,

573
00:30:10,552 --> 00:30:12,552
all I do is protect punks

574
00:30:12,554 --> 00:30:13,937
and spoiled one percenters.

575
00:30:13,939 --> 00:30:15,706
Yeah.

576
00:30:15,708 --> 00:30:18,692
I miss feeling like I'm making
a difference in the world.

577
00:30:18,694 --> 00:30:19,860
Then get out
of personal security

578
00:30:19,862 --> 00:30:21,344
and go do something
you believe in.

579
00:30:21,346 --> 00:30:22,412
Yeah, what if it's wrong?

580
00:30:22,414 --> 00:30:25,132
John, if you
believe in something,

581
00:30:25,134 --> 00:30:27,200
how can it be wrong?

582
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,353
What do you want?

583
00:30:30,355 --> 00:30:31,955
You're gonna confess
that you arranged

584
00:30:31,957 --> 00:30:33,657
to have Peter Declan's wife
murdered.

585
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:35,742
What, so I can
take his place in prison?

586
00:30:35,744 --> 00:30:37,794
So you can avoid
the death penalty.

587
00:30:37,796 --> 00:30:39,179
Except if I'm dead,

588
00:30:39,181 --> 00:30:41,581
well, then, you've got no one
to pin Camille's murder on.

589
00:30:41,583 --> 00:30:44,418
You need me to exonerate
Peter Declan.

590
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,169
Maybe you could try to force me

591
00:30:46,171 --> 00:30:48,037
to sign a confession
or something.

592
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:49,923
Yaah!
That might be difficult.

593
00:30:51,894 --> 00:30:53,810
My hand!

594
00:30:56,264 --> 00:30:59,883
Just answer it.

595
00:31:00,935 --> 00:31:02,069
What?
It's Ankov.

596
00:31:02,071 --> 00:31:04,071
It's going down, one hour.

597
00:31:04,073 --> 00:31:07,324
What's going down in an hour?

598
00:31:08,443 --> 00:31:09,826
What?!

599
00:31:09,828 --> 00:31:11,895
Let's just say...

600
00:31:11,897 --> 00:31:13,780
Peter Declan's execution,

601
00:31:13,782 --> 00:31:16,450
it's getting moved up.

602
00:31:21,556 --> 00:31:22,906
We still have a shot.

603
00:31:22,908 --> 00:31:24,741
Do you remember
the friend that I mentioned,

604
00:31:24,743 --> 00:31:25,959
the one who believes in you?

605
00:31:25,961 --> 00:31:27,961
He is working on something.

606
00:31:34,368 --> 00:31:35,569
I told you,

607
00:31:35,571 --> 00:31:38,472
Jason Brodeur is powerful.

608
00:31:44,362 --> 00:31:46,530
Time to unlock the cages.

609
00:31:46,532 --> 00:31:47,781
I've been here before.

610
00:31:47,783 --> 00:31:51,568
These lawyers holding out
these little nuggets of hope.

611
00:32:02,286 --> 00:32:03,386
What..

612
00:32:09,421 --> 00:32:11,921
Secure all corners
in cell block "C".

613
00:32:11,923 --> 00:32:12,956
The warden's setting up

614
00:32:12,958 --> 00:32:14,240
a secure perimeter
in "C" block.

615
00:32:14,242 --> 00:32:15,425
Stay here,
Ms. Lance.

616
00:32:15,427 --> 00:32:17,577
Wait!

617
00:32:35,946 --> 00:32:37,897
There's Lance.

618
00:32:39,284 --> 00:32:40,533
Let's go.

619
00:33:26,247 --> 00:33:27,414
Stop.

620
00:33:37,508 --> 00:33:39,992
Get down!

621
00:33:39,994 --> 00:33:42,295
Get down!
Get out there!

622
00:33:45,549 --> 00:33:47,684
Stay down!
Stay down!

623
00:33:47,686 --> 00:33:49,269
Don't move!

624
00:33:54,525 --> 00:33:57,277
Laurel.

625
00:33:58,813 --> 00:34:00,897
Sweetie.

626
00:34:00,899 --> 00:34:02,115
What are you--

627
00:34:02,117 --> 00:34:04,067
I'm all right.

628
00:34:04,069 --> 00:34:05,184
You sure?

629
00:34:05,186 --> 00:34:07,120
I'm sorry about
what I said to you.

630
00:34:07,122 --> 00:34:08,354
Yeah, well, you were right.

631
00:34:08,356 --> 00:34:10,189
Ankov just confessed
to Camille Declan's murder.

632
00:34:10,191 --> 00:34:11,858
We got the wrong guy.

633
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,626
Now, listen to me, Laurel.

634
00:34:13,628 --> 00:34:14,911
I'm right, too, about him.

635
00:34:14,913 --> 00:34:16,413
He's dangerous.

636
00:34:16,415 --> 00:34:17,831
He's outside the law.

637
00:34:17,833 --> 00:34:19,382
I know.

638
00:34:21,655 --> 00:34:23,656
He's a killer.

639
00:34:25,264 --> 00:34:27,114
He would have killed that man.

640
00:34:27,592 --> 00:34:29,777
I looked in his eyes,

641
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:32,296
it's like he had no remorse.

642
00:34:39,186 --> 00:34:42,489
Hey, please.

643
00:34:44,408 --> 00:34:46,225
I'm starving.

644
00:34:47,161 --> 00:34:50,229
I never killed anything before.

645
00:35:10,184 --> 00:35:11,935
I'm sorry.

646
00:35:27,619 --> 00:35:29,268
Let's get you home,
sweetie.

647
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:32,322
How'd he get into
that prison, anyway, huh?

648
00:35:32,324 --> 00:35:35,124
A grown man
in an outfit and a hood,

649
00:35:35,126 --> 00:35:38,127
that kind of stands out a little,
doesn't it?

650
00:35:38,129 --> 00:35:40,830
He actually wasn't
wearing the outfit this time.

651
00:35:40,832 --> 00:35:42,832
He was
in a prison guard uniform

652
00:35:42,834 --> 00:35:44,283
and a ski mask.

653
00:35:47,004 --> 00:35:48,755
- What?
- Nothing.

654
00:35:48,757 --> 00:35:50,423
I just had an idea.

655
00:35:50,425 --> 00:35:52,725
Get in the car.

656
00:37:07,217 --> 00:37:09,052
Ok, here's the security footage

657
00:37:09,054 --> 00:37:10,703
from the Exchange
building shooting,

658
00:37:10,705 --> 00:37:12,338
but I've already
scrubbed through all of it.

659
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,973
Yeah? Well,
we're gonna do it again.

660
00:37:15,092 --> 00:37:16,225
So, listen,
when you went through

661
00:37:16,227 --> 00:37:17,627
the camera security tapes,
you were looking for

662
00:37:17,629 --> 00:37:19,562
a guy in a green outfit
and a green hood, right?

663
00:37:19,564 --> 00:37:20,813
What do you want me
to look for,

664
00:37:20,815 --> 00:37:22,231
a man in a wig and a tutu?

665
00:37:22,233 --> 00:37:23,900
I want you to look for anything

666
00:37:23,902 --> 00:37:25,985
that's out of the ordinary,
ok? Just look.

667
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,296
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait. Wait.

668
00:37:34,298 --> 00:37:36,498
Go back 10 seconds.
What is that?

669
00:37:39,252 --> 00:37:41,453
I'll be damned.

670
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:46,396
Play that again.

671
00:37:52,139 --> 00:37:53,739
Thank you, Laurel.

672
00:37:53,741 --> 00:37:55,107
Don't thank me.

673
00:37:55,109 --> 00:37:58,693
Thank Brodeur's bodyguard
Ankov for flipping him.

674
00:38:00,029 --> 00:38:02,664
I think there's someone
that wants to see you.

675
00:38:02,666 --> 00:38:04,482
Izzy.

676
00:38:18,998 --> 00:38:23,001
At least 5 federal, state,
and local agencies

677
00:38:23,003 --> 00:38:24,686
are seeking millions of dollars

678
00:38:24,688 --> 00:38:27,255
in fines and
environmental cleanup costs

679
00:38:27,257 --> 00:38:29,241
from Brodeur Chemical,

680
00:38:29,243 --> 00:38:33,111
new facts have come to light that
Brodeur Chemical employee Camille Declan

681
00:38:33,113 --> 00:38:36,398
had discovered Brodeur
was illegally disposing waste

682
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,700
and had collected
a file of evidence

683
00:38:38,702 --> 00:38:42,120
against her employer
before her murder in 2007.

684
00:38:42,122 --> 00:38:45,690
Peter Declan, who was
convicted of killing his wife,

685
00:38:45,692 --> 00:38:48,877
has been released,
and the case has been reopened.

686
00:39:01,924 --> 00:39:03,809
Shengcún.

687
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,645
Yeah.

688
00:39:06,647 --> 00:39:08,346
Bird. I know.

689
00:39:08,348 --> 00:39:11,817
Shengcún
not mean "bird."

690
00:39:11,819 --> 00:39:14,436
Shengcún
mean "survive."

691
00:39:15,554 --> 00:39:17,072
You speak English.

692
00:39:17,074 --> 00:39:20,525
You want survive this place,

693
00:39:20,527 --> 00:39:23,895
bird not last thing you kill.

694
00:39:28,451 --> 00:39:30,252
And forget her.

695
00:39:30,254 --> 00:39:33,672
You look at that all day,

696
00:39:33,674 --> 00:39:35,957
you not survive this place.

697
00:39:51,891 --> 00:39:53,725
You wanted to see me?

698
00:39:55,278 --> 00:39:56,761
You look nervous, Moira.

699
00:39:56,763 --> 00:39:59,597
Hmm. Do I have
a reason to be?

700
00:40:00,933 --> 00:40:02,534
We all do.

701
00:40:08,708 --> 00:40:11,893
A modern-day Robin Hood.

702
00:40:11,895 --> 00:40:15,630
What, are you worried that your
net worth makes you a target?

703
00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:21,586
Jason Brodeur, Adam Hunt,

704
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:23,088
Warren Patel.

705
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:25,774
Tell me you see
a connection, Moira.

706
00:40:25,776 --> 00:40:27,526
He's not targeting the rich.

707
00:40:27,528 --> 00:40:28,977
No, he's not.

708
00:40:28,979 --> 00:40:31,563
He's targeting the list.

709
00:40:39,005 --> 00:40:41,006
You here
for the bodyguard position?

710
00:40:41,008 --> 00:40:43,191
'Cause the new guy just quit.

711
00:40:43,193 --> 00:40:44,642
No, I'm not.

712
00:40:46,195 --> 00:40:47,996
I'm here about
the other position.

713
00:40:50,483 --> 00:40:52,650
Just to be clear,

714
00:40:52,652 --> 00:40:55,620
I'm not signing on
to be a sidekick.

715
00:40:55,622 --> 00:40:56,988
But you're right.

716
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:58,757
Fighting for this city
needs to be done,

717
00:40:58,759 --> 00:41:00,709
and you're gonna do this
with or without me.

718
00:41:00,711 --> 00:41:02,711
Yeah.
But with me,

719
00:41:02,713 --> 00:41:05,013
there'll be fewer casualties,
including you.

720
00:41:05,015 --> 00:41:07,933
Diggle, I'm not looking
for anybody to save me.

721
00:41:07,935 --> 00:41:10,435
Maybe not,

722
00:41:10,437 --> 00:41:12,771
but you need someone
just the same.

723
00:41:12,773 --> 00:41:14,672
You are fighting a war, Queen,

724
00:41:14,674 --> 00:41:17,842
except you have
no idea what war does to you,

725
00:41:17,844 --> 00:41:21,196
how it scrapes off
little pieces of your soul.

726
00:41:22,798 --> 00:41:25,066
And you need someone
to remind you

727
00:41:25,068 --> 00:41:27,035
of who you are,

728
00:41:27,037 --> 00:41:28,903
not this thing you're becoming.

729
00:41:36,263 --> 00:41:37,862
Oliver Queen.
What is this?

730
00:41:37,864 --> 00:41:39,164
You can't just barge in here.

731
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:41,583
Yeah? Well, I got a badge
and a gun that say different.

732
00:41:41,585 --> 00:41:43,084
Hey, what the hell's going on?!

733
00:41:43,086 --> 00:41:44,252
Detective Lance--

734
00:41:44,254 --> 00:41:46,221
Oliver Queen,
you're under arrest on suspicion

735
00:41:46,223 --> 00:41:47,806
of obstruction of justice,
aggravated assault...

736
00:41:47,808 --> 00:41:49,057
What is going on?
Walter, stop them!

737
00:41:49,059 --> 00:41:50,642
Trespassing,
acting as a vigilante...

738
00:41:50,644 --> 00:41:52,560
Are you out of your mind?!

739
00:41:52,562 --> 00:41:53,728
And murder.

740
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:56,097
You have the right
to remain silent.

741
00:41:56,099 --> 00:41:57,649
Give up that right...

742
00:41:57,674 --> 00:42:02,674
