Tai Lung is free! I must warn Shifu.

495
00:32:08,344 --> 00:32:10,262
You're not going anywhere!
Neither is he!

496
00:32:10,346 --> 00:32:12,181
- Let go of me!
- Bring it up!

497

Wait! Bring it back!

- He won't get far. Archers!

- Can we run now?
- Yes.

507
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:05,688
I'm glad Shifu sent you.

508
00:35:07,982 --> 00:35:10,776
I was beginning to think
I'd been forgotten.

509
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:12,903
Fly back there and tell them

510
00:35:12,987 --> 00:35:16,699
the real Dragon Warrior
is coming home.

(CHUCKLES)

517
00:35:39,513 --> 00:35:40,723
He's quit.

518
00:35:42,725 --> 00:35:45,728
What do we do now, Master,
with the panda gone?

519
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:47,813
Who will be the Dragon Warrior?

520
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:50,983
All we can do is resume our training
and trust that in time,

521
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:53,694
the true Dragon Warrior
will be revealed.

522
00:35:55,195 --> 00:35:56,739
What are you doing here?

523
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:59,658
Hi! Good morning, Master!

524
00:35:59,742 --> 00:36:01,577
I thought I'd warm up a little.

525
00:36:03,746 --> 00:36:04,705
You're stuck.

526
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:07,166
Stuck? No. What? Stuck?

527
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:10,961
No. This is one of my... Yeah, I'm stuck.

528
00:36:11,045 --> 00:36:12,963
- Help him.
- Oh, dear.

529
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:16,592
Maybe on three. One, two,

530
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:18,844
three.

531
00:36:20,596 --> 00:36:22,264
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

532
00:36:22,348 --> 00:36:25,517
- No, really, I appreciate...
- Ever.

533
00:36:25,601 --> 00:36:29,646
You actually thought you could learn
to do a full split in one night?

534
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:32,858
It takes years to develop one's flexibility!

535
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:36,737
And years longer to apply it in combat!

536
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:47,873
Put that down!

537
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:52,419
The only souvenirs we collect here are
bloody knuckles and broken bones.

538
00:36:52,503 --> 00:36:55,464
(CHUCKLING) Yeah! Excellent.

539
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:57,466
Let's get started.

540
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,637
- Are you ready?
- I was born ready...

541
00:37:02,471 --> 00:37:03,472
(GROANS)

542
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:06,642
I'm sorry, brother.
I thought you said you were ready.

543
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:10,020
That was awesome! Let's go again!

544
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:39,299
I've been taking it easy on you, panda.
But no more.

545
00:37:39,383 --> 00:37:41,718
Your next opponent will be me.

546
00:37:41,802 --> 00:37:43,554
All right! Yeah, let's go!

547
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:48,434
Step forth.

548
00:37:48,517 --> 00:37:51,645
The true path to victory is to find
your opponent's weakness

549
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:53,605
and make him suffer for it.

550
00:37:53,689 --> 00:37:54,982
Oh, yeah!

551
00:37:55,065 --> 00:37:58,444
To take his strength
and use it against him

552
00:37:58,527 --> 00:38:00,988
until he finally falls

553
00:38:01,071 --> 00:38:02,072
or quits.

554
00:38:02,156 --> 00:38:04,199
A real warrior never quits.

555
00:38:04,283 --> 00:38:07,494
Don't worry, Master. I will never quit!

(SCREAMS)

557
00:38:17,713 --> 00:38:20,883
If he's smart,
he won't come back up those steps.

558
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:22,301
But he will.

559
00:38:22,384 --> 00:38:24,636
He's not going to quit, is he?

560
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,514
He's not going to quit bouncing,
I'll tell you that.

Guys, guys, I know about Tai Lung.

588
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:52,307
He was a student. The first ever to
master the thousand scrolls of kung fu.

And then he turned bad,
and now he's in jail.

<i>and he raised him as his son.</i>

593

<i>And when the boy showed
talent in kung fu,</i>

594
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,293
<i>Shifu trained him.</i>

595

<i>He believed in him. He told him
he was destined for greatness.</i>

00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:26,967
<i>It was never enough for Tai Lung.</i>

<i>But Oogway saw darkness
in his heart and refused.</i>

<i>Outraged, Tai Lung
laid waste to the valley.</i>

<i>He tried to take the scroll by force.</i>

<i>And Shifu had to destroy
what he had created.</i>

<i>Or since.</i>

00:41:28,654 --> 00:41:31,823
And now he has a chance
to make things right.

To train the true Dragon Warrior.

608

And he's stuck with you.

Shifu.

626
00:42:46,565 --> 00:42:50,318
There is just news.
There is no good or bad.

627
00:42:50,402 --> 00:42:53,697
Master, your vision...
Your vision was right.

628
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:57,159
Tai Lung has broken out of prison.
He's on his way.

629
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:01,371
That is bad news

630
00:43:01,455 --> 00:43:05,834
if you do not believe
that the Dragon Warrior can stop him.

631
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:10,172
The panda? Master,
that panda is not the Dragon Warrior.

632
00:43:10,255 --> 00:43:13,550
He wasn't meant to be here!
It was an accident.

- Twice.
- Well, that was no accident, either.

My old friend,

639
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:32,110
the panda will never fulfill
his destiny, nor you yours,

640
00:43:32,194 --> 00:43:35,739
until you let go of the illusion of control.

Illusion?

642
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:40,243
Yes. Look at this tree, Shifu.

00:43:40,327 --> 00:43:43,330
I cannot make it blossom
when it suits me,

644

nor make it bear fruit before its time.

But there are things we can control.

646
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:53,465
I can control when the fruit will fall.

647
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:56,218
And I can control

648
00:43:57,302 --> 00:43:59,304
where to plant the seed.

649
00:43:59,805 --> 00:44:01,890
That is no illusion, Master.

00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:33,391
After you, panda.

814
00:56:33,474 --> 00:56:35,142
Just like that?

815
00:56:35,226 --> 00:56:38,729
No sit-ups? No 10-mile hike?

816
00:56:38,813 --> 00:56:43,317
I vowed to train you, and you
have been trained. You are free to eat.

817
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:50,324
Enjoy.

818
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:53,327
Hey!

819
00:56:53,411 --> 00:56:56,539
I said you are free to eat.
Have a dumpling.

820
00:56:57,873 --> 00:56:59,333
Hey!

821
00:57:05,548 --> 00:57:07,508
You are free to eat.

822
00:57:07,592 --> 00:57:09,510
- Am I?
- Are you?

823
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:37,473
I'm not hungry.

824
00:58:41,102 --> 00:58:42,269
Master.

(GROWLS)

826
00:59:12,466 --> 00:59:13,801
Cut it!

827
00:59:30,985 --> 00:59:32,778
Where's the Dragon Warrior?

828
00:59:32,862 --> 00:59:34,238
How do you know
you're not looking at her?

829
00:59:34,321 --> 00:59:35,698
(LAUGHING)

830
00:59:35,948 --> 00:59:38,117
You think I'm a fool?

831
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:41,829
I know you're not the Dragon Warrior.
None of you!

832
00:59:41,912 --> 00:59:45,166
I heard how he fell out of the sky
in a ball of fire.

833
00:59:45,249 --> 00:59:49,670
That he's a warrior unlike
anything the world has ever seen.

834
00:59:49,754 --> 00:59:55,342
- Po?
- So that is his name. Po.

835
00:59:55,426 --> 00:59:58,512
Finally, a worthy opponent.

836
00:59:58,596 --> 01:00:01,098
Our battle will be legendary!

837
01:00:21,076 --> 01:00:22,787
We've got this. Help her.

838
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:48,562
Monkey!

839
01:00:48,646 --> 01:00:50,481
Go!

840
01:00:50,564 --> 01:00:51,732
What was I thinking?

841
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:03,244
Mantis!

842
01:01:07,915 --> 01:01:09,375
Now!

(ALL PANTING)

845
01:01:55,296 --> 01:01:57,590
Shifu taught you well.

846
01:01:59,466 --> 01:02:00,467
(GASPS)

847
01:02:00,551 --> 01:02:02,553
But he didn't teach you everything.

848
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,142
SHIFU: You have done well, panda.

849
01:02:08,726 --> 01:02:11,896
Done well? Done well?

850
01:02:11,979 --> 01:02:13,314
I've done awesome!

851
01:02:14,982 --> 01:02:18,777
The mark of a true hero is humility.

852
01:02:18,861 --> 01:02:21,488
But, yes, you have done

853
01:02:21,572 --> 01:02:22,907
awesome.

854
01:02:30,164 --> 01:02:33,459
Guys? Guys? They're dead!

855
01:02:33,542 --> 01:02:36,962
No, they're breathing. They're asleep?
No, their eyes are open.

856
01:02:37,046 --> 01:02:39,048
We were no match for his nerve attack.

857
01:02:39,131 --> 01:02:41,342
He's gotten stronger.

858
01:02:41,425 --> 01:02:43,719
Who? Tai Lung? Stronger?

859
01:02:44,929 --> 01:02:46,472
He's too fast!

860
01:02:46,555 --> 01:02:48,140
MONKEY: Sorry, Po.

861
01:02:48,557 --> 01:02:49,558
(GASPS)

862
01:02:49,642 --> 01:02:51,185
I thought we could stop him.

863
01:02:51,352 --> 01:02:53,103
He could have killed you.

864
01:02:53,187 --> 01:02:54,229
Why didn't he?

865
01:02:54,313 --> 01:02:59,109
So you could come back and strike fear
into our hearts. But it won't work.

866
01:02:59,193 --> 01:03:03,113
It might. I mean, a little.

867
01:03:03,197 --> 01:03:04,448
I'm pretty scared.

868
01:03:04,531 --> 01:03:05,991
You can defeat him, panda!

869
01:03:06,075 --> 01:03:08,994
Are you kidding? If they can't?

870
01:03:09,078 --> 01:03:12,081
They're five masters. I'm just one me.

871
01:03:12,164 --> 01:03:15,542
But you will have
the one thing that no one else does.

872
01:03:20,881 --> 01:03:23,342
You really believe I'm ready?

873
01:03:23,425 --> 01:03:25,094
You are,

874
01:03:25,177 --> 01:03:26,470
Po.

875
01:04:15,769 --> 01:04:19,023
Behold the Dragon Scroll.

876
01:04:19,106 --> 01:04:21,025
It is yours.

877
01:04:21,108 --> 01:04:24,028
Wait. What happens when I read it?

878
01:04:24,111 --> 01:04:25,112
No one knows.

879
01:04:25,195 --> 01:04:28,157
But legend says you will be able
to hear a butterfly's wing beat.

880
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:30,451
Really? That's cool.

881
01:04:30,534 --> 01:04:33,370
Yes. And see light in the deepest cave.

882
01:04:33,454 --> 01:04:36,331
You will feel the universe
in motion around you.

Wow! Can I punch through walls?

884

- Can I do a quadruple back flip?
- Focus.

885

- Will I have invisibility... Huh?
- Focus.

886
01:04:42,546 --> 01:04:43,922
- Focus.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

Okay. Come on, baby. Come on, now.

- Here, look.
- No, I am forbidden to look upon...

I don't understand.

Okay. So, like,

905

Oogway was
just a crazy old turtle after all.

906

No. Oogway was wiser than us all.

Oh, come on! Face it,
he picked me by accident.

Of course I'm not the Dragon Warrior.
Who am I kidding?

and everyone.

No.

Evacuate the valley. You must protect
the villagers from Tai Lung's rage.

913
01:06:12,136 --> 01:06:14,513
- What about you, Master?
- I will fight him.

914
01:06:14,596 --> 01:06:17,307
- What?
- I can hold him off long enough

915
01:06:17,391 --> 01:06:18,809
for everyone to escape.

916
01:06:18,892 --> 01:06:21,353
But, Shifu, he'll kill you.

917
01:06:21,854 --> 01:06:24,690
Then I will finally have paid
for my mistake.

Listen to me, all of you.

your journey without me.

to have been your master.

Come, little one. Let's find your mama.

Let's go, Po.

931
01:07:55,322 --> 01:07:58,116
So for our next shop, it's time to face it,

932
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:01,703
the future of noodles
is dice-cut vegetables,

933

no longer slices.

934
01:08:04,331 --> 01:08:07,584
Also, I was thinking, maybe this time

935
01:08:07,668 --> 01:08:11,088
we'll have a kitchen
you can actually stand up in.

01:08:12,297 --> 01:08:13,507
You like that?

937
01:08:19,721 --> 01:08:24,309
Po, I'm sorry things didn't work out.

938
01:08:24,393 --> 01:08:27,437
It just wasn't meant to be.

939
01:08:30,899 --> 01:08:33,402
Po, forget everything else.

940
01:08:33,485 --> 01:08:35,654
Your destiny still awaits.

941
01:08:35,737 --> 01:08:40,867
We are noodle folk.
Broth runs deep through our veins.

942
01:08:40,951 --> 01:08:42,869
I don't know, Dad.

943
01:08:42,953 --> 01:08:46,957
Honestly, sometimes
I can't believe I'm actually your son.

944
01:08:50,335 --> 01:08:51,420
Po,

945
01:08:51,503 --> 01:08:55,924
I think it's time I told you
something I should have told you

946
01:08:56,008 --> 01:08:58,051
a long time ago.

947
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:00,512
Okay.

948
01:09:01,221 --> 01:09:05,434
The secret ingredient
of my Secret Ingredient Soup.

949
01:09:05,851 --> 01:09:06,852
Oh!

950
01:09:08,186 --> 01:09:12,816
Come here. The secret ingredient is

951
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:13,900
nothing.

952
01:09:14,693 --> 01:09:17,696
- Huh?
- You heard me. Nothing!

953
01:09:17,779 --> 01:09:20,240
There is no secret ingredient!

954
01:09:20,324 --> 01:09:23,368
Wait, wait.
It's just plain old noodle soup?

955
01:09:23,452 --> 01:09:25,954
You don't add some kind of
special sauce or something?

956
01:09:26,038 --> 01:09:28,332
Don't have to.
To make something special,

957
01:09:28,415 --> 01:09:31,418
you just have to believe it's special.

958
01:09:41,470 --> 01:09:43,972
There is no secret ingredient.

959
01:10:06,578 --> 01:10:09,373
I have come home, Master.

960
01:10:09,456 --> 01:10:12,709
This is no longer your home.
And I am no longer your master.

961
01:10:12,793 --> 01:10:16,713
Oh, yes. You have a new favorite.

962
01:10:16,797 --> 01:10:19,883
So where is this Po?

963
01:10:21,301 --> 01:10:22,552
Did I scare him off?

964
01:10:22,636 --> 01:10:24,971
This battle is between you and me.

965
01:10:26,348 --> 01:10:29,476
So, that is how it's going to be.

966
01:10:29,559 --> 01:10:31,603
That is how it must be.

967
01:10:32,020 --> 01:10:33,021
(GROWLING)

968
01:10:46,034 --> 01:10:50,580
I rotted in jail for 20 years
because of your weakness!

969
01:10:50,664 --> 01:10:52,749
Obeying your master is not weakness!

970
01:10:52,833 --> 01:10:55,919
You knew I was the Dragon Warrior.

971
01:10:56,002 --> 01:10:58,171
<i>You always knew.</i>

972
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:03,385
<i>But when Oogway said otherwise,
what did you do?</i>

973
01:11:04,344 --> 01:11:06,888
<i>What did you do?</i>

974
01:11:09,349 --> 01:11:10,434
Nothing!

975
01:11:10,517 --> 01:11:13,353
You were not meant to be the Dragon
Warrior! That was not my fault!

976
01:11:13,437 --> 01:11:15,188
