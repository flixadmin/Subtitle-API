00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:13,970
I adore her. She's always been
so generous with me, so kind.

And the horrors she's had to endure...

her eldest child, and her father.

That's where you grew up.

You always told me
that you liked the people there better.

smelled of horse dung and sour milk.

That it was your real home.

00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:24,739
Do you understand that?

165
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,366
Our pact with the Lannisters protects...

166
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:28,451
I had a pact with Tywin Lannister.

167
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,870
And Tywin Lannister is dead.

168
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,956
The remaining Lannisters are
a thousand miles away dealing with that fact.

169
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,834
They've never once,
in the history of the Seven Kingdoms,

170
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:38,836
sent their army this far north.

171
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,005
If you think they will for us, you're a fool.

172
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:46,386
We've become a great house
by entering into alliances with other houses,

173
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:49,764
and parlaying those alliances
into greater power.

174
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:54,894
The best way to forge a lasting alliance
isn't by peeling a man's skin off.

175
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,437
The best way is marriage.

176
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:01,234
Now that you're a Bolton by royal decree,

177
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:04,028
it's high time you married a suitable bride.

178
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,158
And as it happens,

179
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:12,495
I've found the perfect girl
to solidify our hold on the North.

180
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,102
SANSA: That's Moat Cailin.

181
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:39,647
Yes, a bit shabby, isn't it?

182
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,941
You've been here before?

183
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:46,028
On our way down to King's Landing
with my father and Arya.

184
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:48,030
Where are you taking me?

185
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:49,657
Home.

186
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:53,244
The Boltons have Winterfell.

187
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,292
Your marriage proposal, it wasn't for you.

188
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,627
No.

189
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:07,300
Roose Bolton murdered my brother.
He betrayed my family.

190
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,926
He did.

191
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,887
He serves the Lannisters.

192
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,305
For now.

193
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,682
- I won't go.
- Winterfell is your home.

194
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:17,226
- Not anymore.
- Always.

195
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,313
You're a Stark.
Dying your hair doesn't change that.

196
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:25,234
You're Sansa Stark, eldest surviving child
of Ned and Catelyn Stark.

197
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,652
Your place is in the North.

198
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:30,865
I can't marry him. You can't make me.
He is a traitor. A murderer!

199
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,909
You're not marrying Roose Bolton.

200
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:36,454
No, you'll be marrying
his son and heir, Ramsay.

201
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,372
One day he'll be Warden of the North
and you...

202
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:39,707
- No.
- Sansa.

203
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:44,504
No, you can't make me. I will starve myself.
I will die before I have to go there.

204
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:47,882
I won't force you to do anything.

205
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,551
Don't you know by now
how much I care for you?

206
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,971
Say the word and we turn the horses around,
but listen to me.

207
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:55,640
Listen.

208
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,808
You've been running all your life.

209
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,854
Terrible things happen to your family
and you weep.

210
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:05,024
You sit alone in a darkened room
mourning their fates.

211
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:09,529
You've been a bystander to tragedy
from the day they executed your father.

212
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:12,156
Stop being a bystander. Do you hear me?

213
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,449
Stop running.

214
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,957
There's no justice in the world.

215
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,251
Not unless we make it.

216
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,712
You loved your family.

217
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,466
Avenge them.

218
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:12,425
(HORSE NEIGHS)

219
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,884
MAN: Banners!

220
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,778
PODRICK: How do we get through there?

221
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:33,988
BRIENNE: We don't.

222
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:35,948
We go around.

223
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:38,534
Takes us miles out of the way.

224
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:39,827
We'll lose sight of them.

225
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,955
BRIENNE: Doesn't matter.
I know where they're going.

226
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:49,295
Aren't you getting a bit old to be a squire?

227
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:55,551
How did you end up squiring for the Imp?

228
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,428
He hates that nickname.

229
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,889
Well, he's not here to complain about it,
is he?

230
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:08,230
I squired for a knight named Ser Lorimer
during the War of the Five Kings.

231
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:11,484
One night, he had a bit too much to drink,

232
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,153
and he was famished, so he borrowed a ham.

233
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,321
He borrowed it?

234
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,697
He wasn't a thief.

235
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:19,033
He was drunk, and hungry,
and he wasn't thinking.

236
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,369
I was drunk, too.

237
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:22,495
He gave me half the ham.

238
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:28,626
Next morning,
one of the guards saw him passed out

239
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:31,671
under a wagon
with the hambone still in his hand.

240
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:34,715
They hanged him that afternoon.

241
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,259
They tied the noose for me, too,

242
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,388
but Lord Tywin heard
my family name was Payne,

243
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:41,764
so he pardoned me,

244
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,308
and sent me to King's Landing
to squire for his son.

245
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:47,728
As punishment for both of you.

246
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:49,689
It didn't seem that way.

247
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:51,524
Lord Tyrion was always very good to me.

248
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,901
Yes, all your lords have been very kind to you.

249
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:55,695
All except me.

250
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:58,114
Sorry, you had to squire
for such a nasty person.

251
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,282
I'm not sorry.
You're the best fighter I've ever seen.

252
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:02,827
You beat the Hound.

253
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,996
I'm proud to be your squire.

254
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,295
I'm sorry I'm always snapping at you.

255
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,673
If you didn't snap at me,
I wouldn't learn anything.

256
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:20,553
You want to be a knight, Pod?

257
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:23,723
Yes.

258
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:26,559
Starting tomorrow,
we'll train with the sword twice a day,

259
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:29,228
before we ride in the morning
and after you make camp in the evening.

260
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:32,022
And I'm going to show you
how to ride properly.

261
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:33,107
Thank you.

262
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,609
I can't knight you,
but I can teach you how to fight.

263
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:37,528
I suppose that's more important.

264
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:52,209
You weren't a knight,

265
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:55,045
but you were a Kingsguard
to Renly Baratheon, weren't you?

266
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,590
I was.

267
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,009
Lord Tyrion said he was a good man.

268
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,512
He was.

269
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:06,807
How did you end up serving Renly?

270
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:16,192
When I was a girl, my father held a ball.

271
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:19,945
I'm his only living child,
so he wanted to make a good match for me.

272
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:22,615
He invited dozens of young lords to Tarth.

273
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:25,493
I didn't want to go,
but he dragged me to the ballroom.

274
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,623
And it was wonderful.

275
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:36,587
None of the boys noticed
how mulish and tall I was.

276
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:39,632
They shoved each other
and threatened to duel

277
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,009
when they thought it was their turn to dance.

278
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,429
They whispered in my ear

279
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:49,141
how they wanted to marry me
and take me back to their castles.

280
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:54,522
My father smiled at me, and I smiled at him.

281
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:58,275
I had never been so happy.

282
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,864
Till I saw a few of the boys sniggering.

283
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,368
And then they all started to laugh.

284
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:10,496
They couldn't keep
the game going any longer.

285
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,248
They were toying with me.

286
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:17,294
"Brienne the Beauty," they called me.
Great joke.

287
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:22,508
And I realized I was the ugliest girl alive.

288
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:26,428
A great lumbering beast.

289
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:34,770
I tried to run away,
but Renly Baratheon took me in his arms.

290
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:38,440
"Don't let them see your tears," he told me.

291
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:40,359
"They're nasty little shits,

292
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:43,320
"and nasty little shits
aren't worth crying over."

293
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,866
He danced with me,
and none of the other boys could say a word.

294
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:51,120
Renly was the king's brother after all.

295
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,416
But wasn't he...

296
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,253
Lord Tyrion said he was...

297
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,132
Yes, Pod, he liked men. I'm not an idiot.

298
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,885
He didn't love me. He didn't want me.

299
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:09,680
He danced with me because he was kind,
and didn't want to see me hurt.

300
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:13,642
He saved me from being a joke.

301
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:17,271
From that day until his last day.

302
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:22,234
And I couldn't save him in return.

303
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:29,408
Nothing's more hateful
than failing to protect the one you love.

304
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,662
One day I will avenge King Renly.

305
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,582
But you said a shadow murdered him.

306
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:38,709
How do you fight a shadow?

307
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:41,295
A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon.

308
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,634
I know it was Stannis. I know it in my heart.

309
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,847
Stannis is a man, not a shadow.

310
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:56,518
And a man can be killed.

311
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:01,440
- Lord Commander.
- Your Grace.

312
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,359
I'd like to speak alone.

313
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,694
Olly is my steward now,

314
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:08,030
as I was Lord Commander Mormont's.

315
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:12,534
I want him to attend my meetings
to learn from men with experience.

316
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:16,705
One day he might command.

317
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:21,377
Very well.

318
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,587
Have you considered my offer?

319
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:26,298
I have.

320
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:28,425
And I thank you for it.
You do me great honor.

321
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,971
All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark.

322
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,597
Say the word and you will be.

323
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:37,309
But I have to refuse you.

324
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:41,397
I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.

325
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,107
My place is here.

326
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:46,068
I'm giving you the chance
to avenge your family,

327
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:49,697
to take back the castle where you grew up.

328
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:53,826
To rule the North.

329
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:56,245
I wish I could fight beside you.

330
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,205
Believe me, I do.

331
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:01,417
But I swore a sacred vow at the godswood.

332
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:04,586
I pledged my life to the Night's Watch.

333
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,588
You're as stubborn as your father.

334
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:08,590
And as honorable.

335
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:10,843
I can imagine no higher praise.

336
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,094
I didn't mean it as praise.

337
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,555
Honor got your father killed.

338
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,433
But if your mind's made up,
I won't try and dissuade you.

339
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:20,853
May I ask how long you plan
to stay at Castle Black?

340
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,479
Are you bored of us already?

341
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:27,443
You saved us from Mance Rayder's army.
We will never forget that.

342
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:29,695
But it's a question of survival.

343
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:32,406
The Night's Watch can't continue
to feed your men

344
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:35,200
and the wildling prisoners indefinitely.

345

Winter is coming.

346
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:40,622
I know it.

347
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:44,918
We march on Winterfell within the fortnight,
before the snows trap us here.

348
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:47,379
And the wildlings?

349
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:49,631
If they'd rather burn than fight for me,
so be it.

350
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:50,966
I leave their fate to you.

351
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:55,054
You could execute them.
That's the safest course.

352
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:01,101
Or you could see if this Tormund fellow

353
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:03,854
is more willing to compromise
than Mance ever was.

354
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:07,274
I assume the brothers of the Night's Watch
would rather see the wildlings dead.

Most of the brothers, yes.

The king is a complicated man,

but he wants to do what's right
for the Seven Kingdoms.

As long as he's ruling them.

He's the one true king.

372

He has a blood right to that throne.

373
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:09,920
I've sworn to stay clear of the politics
of the Seven Kingdoms.

might not be sitting in a frozen castle
at the edge of the world.

Because I gave them away

We all do that.

Everyone? Hard enough job
reminding myself.

577
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:24,055
Well, I tell them no one's special,
and they think I'm special for telling them so.

Perhaps they're right.

It would be comforting to believe that,
wouldn't it?

I hope not.

582
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:42,615
I had assumed
you'd only come here to arrest me

583
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:44,533
for that incident with the High Septon.

584
00:45:45,368 --> 00:45:47,870
An unacceptable way
to treat the chosen representative

585
00:45:47,954 --> 00:45:50,581
of the gods in this world, wouldn't you say?

586
00:45:50,665 --> 00:45:53,042
Hypocrisy is a boil.

587

more careful with the blade.

The High Septon came to speak to me today.

590
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:07,598
He doesn't want me to arrest you.
He wants me to execute you.

591
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:13,729
I wouldn't presume
to know your thoughts on the matter.

My thoughts on the matter
are in line with your own.

593
00:46:20,403 --> 00:46:24,240
The High Septon's behavior was corrosive,
as was his attitude.

594
00:46:24,365 --> 00:46:28,369
Having a man like that reside in the sept
eats away at the faith from the inside.

595
00:46:29,704 --> 00:46:32,790
So now he resides
in the Red Keep dungeons instead.

596
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:37,962
The faith and the crown are the two pillars
that hold up this world.

One collapses, so does the other.

He kept his house in power
through sheer will.

643

Without him,
Jaime has one hand and no allies.

644

wanes with each passing day.

A rider arrived from the Eyrie
shortly before dawn.

Lord Baelish.

657
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:18,724
If you receive word in the night
from the Queen Mother,

658
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:22,269
it does make me question our new alliance.

659
00:50:23,187 --> 00:50:25,773
The Lannisters made you
one of the great lords of Westeros,

660
00:50:26,524 --> 00:50:29,068
yet here you are in the North
undermining them.

662

Every ambitious move is a gamble.

663
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:38,619
You gambled when you drove a dagger
into Robb Stark's heart.

It appears that your gamble paid off.

You're Warden of the North.

666

The Eyrie is mine.

669
00:50:52,258 --> 00:50:56,720
The last time the lords of the Eyrie
formed an alliance with the lords of the North,

670
00:50:56,804 --> 00:51:00,015
they brought down the greatest dynasty
this world has ever known.
