1
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,175
Ahh!

2
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:11,777
Grape and cookies.

3
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:12,911
Mmm.

4
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:17,916
Good evening.

5
00:00:17,918 --> 00:00:20,652
Uh, fudge nutty?

6
00:00:20,654 --> 00:00:22,021
If you are on a break...

7
00:00:22,023 --> 00:00:24,323
Perhaps someone else
can assist me.

8
00:00:24,325 --> 00:00:25,858
I am the only one here.

9
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,926
What exactly
are you looking for?

10
00:00:27,928 --> 00:00:29,762
Something like this.

11
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:34,800
Note the unusual filigree.

12
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:43,776
Customer:
Rise and shine, my boy.

13
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:46,445
Where am I?

14
00:00:46,447 --> 00:00:48,881
<i>Who</i> am I?

15
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:50,516
You are tohru,

16
00:00:50,518 --> 00:00:54,086
my most loyal henchman.

17
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:51,143
Uncle: Jackie,
next time you take Jade
to movies by yourself.

18
00:01:51,145 --> 00:01:53,779
Popcorn stale,
sound too loud...

19
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:57,116
And story
unrealistic.

20
00:01:57,118 --> 00:01:59,118
Oh, you expected reality

21
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,654
from <i> brain-draining freaks</i>
<i>from planet medulla?</i>

22
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:04,957
Hey, I'm sleeping
with noseplugs tonight.

23
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,093
No alien's
getting its mitts
on my brain matter.

24
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:11,363
(Gasps)

25
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:14,633
I told tohru never
to leave shop door open!

26
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:17,970
You let mosquitoes in
and the air conditioning out!

27
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:20,539
Hey, t!
You missed a classic.

28
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:22,908
Jade: Tohru?

29
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,378
Hello?

30
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,981
He probably
just stepped out
for a minute.

31
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:34,353
Hmm. Tohru
would never leave
without writing note.

32
00:02:34,355 --> 00:02:38,490
And he would never
leave a cookie uneaten.

33
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:44,730
Customer: I am valmont.

34
00:02:44,732 --> 00:02:46,732
don't you remember me?

35
00:02:46,734 --> 00:02:48,901
I remember nothing.

36
00:02:48,903 --> 00:02:50,936
Jolly good potion.

37
00:02:50,938 --> 00:02:56,208
It would seem you are
the victim of amnesia.

38
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,677
Allow me to fill
in some blanks.

39
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:02,014
I am the leader
of the dark hand,

40
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,950
a premiere
crime syndicate,

41
00:03:04,952 --> 00:03:06,785
and you work for me.

42
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:12,124
Premiere crime syndicate?

43
00:03:12,126 --> 00:03:15,060
Um, a temporary setback,
I assure you,

44
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:16,695
but it was
only yesterday

45
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:20,132
that you and I were
at the top of our game.

46
00:03:20,134 --> 00:03:24,536
See? You made
the FBI's most wanted,

47
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,305
3 years running.

48
00:03:26,307 --> 00:03:30,209
Oh, so it is true.
But how?

49
00:03:30,211 --> 00:03:33,045
Our Nemesis must have
throttled you famously

50
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:36,148
for your entire memory
just to up and vanish.

51
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,449
Nemesis?

52
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,820
Jackie chan.

53
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:45,524
Chan will pay.

54
00:03:45,526 --> 00:03:49,061
In good time,
loyal one,
in good time.

55
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:53,765
First, we have
a very important
flight to catch.

56
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,570
(Chanting)
<i>Yu mo gue guai fi di ziao.</i>

57
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,639
<i>Yu mo gue guai</i>
<i>fi di ziao.</i>

58
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:08,580
Tohru is there.

59
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,515
How did
he get there?

60
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:12,317
Told you
he's been kidnapped.

61
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,353
Let's bring
our boy home.

62
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:22,194
Master, are there
no closer banks
for us to rob?

63
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:24,429
We have not traveled
to Sri Lanka

64
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:27,599
for any run-of-the-mill
heist, tohru.

65
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:31,436
We are here
for the score
of a lifetime.

66
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,038
And the beauty of it?

67
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,607
All we require
is your muscle

68
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:38,443
and the instructions
to a secret location,

69
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,612
which we
are soon to collect.

70
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,681
Now, be on
your best behavior.

71
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:44,149
Yes, master.

72
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,888
Chundi!

73
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:53,725
How my heart soars
to see you again.

74
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:58,797
Master babur,
it pleases me

75
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:02,901
to introduce
my protg tohru.

76
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:05,470
Ah, any brother
to chundi

77
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:08,106
is a brother
to our monastery.

78
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:10,642
Tohru, assume
lotus position

79
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:13,278
while babur
and I catch up.

80
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,813
So, chundi,

81
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,482
could it be you have
finally returned

82
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:20,385
to attain
true enrichment?

83
00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:24,122
You have a way with words,
master babur.

84
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:27,993
Then you shall be among
the privileged few,

85
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:30,162
the purest of spirit,

86
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:33,498
who have communed
at the legendary temple.

87
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,535
Your companion
is also worthy?

88
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:38,036
Uhh!

89
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:41,340
Oh, yes, indeed.

90
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:43,342
Tohru possesses
great strength--

91
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:48,914
uh, inner strength--
of a most spiritual nature.

92
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:54,152
Then come. Allow me
to bestow upon you
the directions

93
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:58,724
to the temple
of the golden elephant.

94
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,027
Uncle...

95
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,195
I'm parched.

96
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:04,863
Can't we
just drink it?

97
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:07,032
We are out of water.

98
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:09,368
Do you want
to find tohru?

99
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,502
Yes?

100
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:16,408
Then we must not
drink locator spell!

101
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,143
Uh, how about now?

102
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:30,288
Unh! Uhh-uhh-uhh!

103
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:33,392
Tohru!

104
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:35,460
Ahh, he is safe.

105
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:36,828
What's he doing?

106
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:40,232
It would seem
my apprentice
seeks inner peace.

107
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:44,503
So I will give him
piece...Of uncle,

108
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:46,405
for making us worry
ourselves sick!

109
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:49,374
And I will fetch us
some water.

110
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,311
Hey, big fella!

111
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:55,614
Remove yourself, child.

112
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:57,249
What's with the 'tude,
dude?

113
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:59,251
I came halfway around
the world to find you.

114
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:01,420
You are
lousy shopkeeper!

115
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:02,921
You leave
without sweeping.

116
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:06,358
Uncle could have
slipped on crumbs
and broken hip!

117
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,994
What are you
jabbering about,
old fool?

118
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:10,195
(Gasps)

119
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:13,999
You speak
to your <i> sensei</i>
that way?

120
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:16,568
Ow! Grrrr!

121
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:20,439
Tohru, what is with you?

122
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:23,575
You...Know my name?

123
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:27,612
Uh, Jackie, I don't think
tohru recognizes us.

124
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:30,582
What? Oh, do not
be silly, Jade.

125
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:32,884
Jackie chan.

126
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:36,655
See? Tohru knows
exactly who I am.

127
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:38,089
My Nemesis!

128
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:45,997
Uhh!
- Uhh!

129
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:48,733
Ayah!

130
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,503
Tohru, it is me, Jackie!

131
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:54,406
Yes, I know. Yaah!

132
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:58,877
Jackie,
don't hurt tohru!

133
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,012
What about me?

134
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:02,347
Rarrgghh!

135
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:08,753
Tohru, whatever I did
to anger you I am sorry!

136
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:13,191
Lastly, you will both emerge
from the bamboo forest

137
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:16,228
to find yourselves
at the lake of riddles.

138
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,562
(Crashing)

139
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:19,364
Ooh, what was that?

140
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,900
Whoa! Oof!

141
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:23,235
Unnnh!

142
00:08:23,237 --> 00:08:25,237
Freak pottery accident.

143
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:27,739
Frightful how they'll
just spontaneously
combust.

144
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,741
Shall we press on then?

145
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:31,776
Tohru: I will crush you!

146
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,478
Uhh!

147
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:37,415
Tohru is not acting
like himself.

148
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:39,184
Oh, yes, he is.

149
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,553
His <i> old</i> self.

150
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:44,723
Chundi,
what are you hiding?

151
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:46,591
This is not
the behavior of one

152
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:49,060
who is prepared
to visit the temple.

153
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:51,796
Which reminds me,
left or right
at the lake?

154
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:53,064
Across.

155
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:54,699
Oop.

156
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:57,102
Thank you, master.

157
00:08:57,104 --> 00:09:00,105
And now that I have
been enlightened,

158
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:02,874
let us forget
that we ever
had this chat.

159
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,252
It's time to jog
tohru's memory!

160
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:22,227
Tohru, remember
all those times

161
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,795
we butt-whupped
the shadowkhan?

162
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:24,996
The who?

163
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:26,631
Uh, ok,
never mind them.

164
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:28,967
Well, how about the time
you helped me get over
the crush I had

165
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:30,969
on the kid in my class
who was a demon?

166
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:33,238
There is no such thing
as demons.

167
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,639
Grrr!

168
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:36,675
Tohru, remember?

169
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:38,009
Your favorite--

170
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:39,878
grape soda.

171
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,313
Grape what?

172
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,648
Ooooh!

173
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,817
(Growls)

174
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:47,519
Uhh!

175
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:50,021
Jade: Tohru, stop this!

176
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:52,357
Why are you acting like you
work for the dark hand?

177
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:55,727
Because I work
for the dark hand.

178
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:57,796
Uncle: Then shame on you!

179
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:05,036
Just like old times.

180
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:08,173
Maybe that will knock
some sense into him.

181
00:10:08,175 --> 00:10:11,376
But how did it
get knocked out of him
in the first place?

182
00:10:11,378 --> 00:10:12,711
He's how!

183
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:16,915
Valmont!
- Valmont!

184
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:24,055
What have you done
to tohru?

185
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:26,858
Last I saw, he was
rolling down a hill.

186
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,860
Your doing, I believe.

187
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:31,196
Tell us the truth,
friar liar!

188
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:33,865
Perhaps tohru had enough
of sweeping floors

189
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:36,468
and decided
to take a better offer.

190
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,902
Mine.

191
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:39,871
Uncle: Sweeping floors
may be dirty work,

192
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:41,406
but it is honest!

193
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:42,540
Tohru is family.

194
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:44,376
He'd never
join you again!

195
00:10:44,378 --> 00:10:46,711
Well, if you
don't believe me...

196
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:48,813
Why don't
you just ask him?

197
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:53,485
(Tohru growls)

198
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,720
Tohru, please.

199
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:57,622
T, don't listen
to valmont!

200
00:10:57,624 --> 00:11:00,959
Uncle: You will
pay for this.

201
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:03,495
Aah!
- Aah!
- Aah!

202
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,001
Uhh! Unh!

203
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:16,908
Dark hand 3,
Jackie chan 0.

204
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,210
Come, tohru.

205
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:20,679
Yes, master.

206
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:26,918
Uncle: Ayah!

207
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,086
We are trapped!

208
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:29,988
And we've lost tohru.

209
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:32,023
For good.

210
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:40,432
(Jackie grunting)

211
00:11:40,434 --> 00:11:41,800
Uhh!

212
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:43,635
It is no use.

213
00:11:43,637 --> 00:11:46,037
Well, if valmont can crawl
out from under a rock,

214
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,473
to steal back tohru,
we can, too.

215
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:51,810
Steal him back,
I mean, er, again.

216
00:11:51,812 --> 00:11:54,179
Uncle: <i> Yu mo gue</i>
<i>guai fi di ziao.</i>

217
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:56,314
<i>Yu mo gue guai</i>
<i>fi di ziao.</i>

218
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:58,383
<i>Yu mo gue guai fi di zi--</i>

219
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:03,855
uncle, you rock!
Levitation spell?

220
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:08,326
Uncle cannot pack
spell ingredients
for every occasion!

221
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,973
Sheesh! Who says
mud baths are relaxing?

222
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:23,908
Did you see
where tohru went?

223
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,076
Big fellow.

224
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,312
Monk: Aieee!

225
00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:30,248
Master babur
has lost his memory.

226
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,716
Who is babur?

227
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:33,184
See?

228
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:35,754
Whoa. This amnesia bug's
really going around.

229
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:40,091
Hotcha!
If babur and tohru
both have amnesia,

230
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:43,228
valmont must have used
a potion on them.

231
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:49,467
And with that potion,
uncle can devise antidote
to bring back tohru's memory.

232
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:51,603
Valmont must still
have it with him.

233
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:52,937
We just
have to find him.

234
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:55,140
Oh, there is
no hope of that.

235
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:58,610
The strangers have
embarked for the temple
of the golden elephant,

236
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:02,113
and only master babur
knows where it is.

237
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,782
Are you my mother?

238
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:08,686
Oh, the temple's location
is lost forever.

239
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:14,526
Oh? Can of grape soda
tells uncle otherwise.

240
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,731
Valmont: Ahh.

241
00:13:19,733 --> 00:13:24,536
The golden elephant
lies within that temple.

242
00:13:24,538 --> 00:13:25,637
Ow!

243
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,672
don't you recognize
boiling water?

244
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:31,976
Oh, now,
how do we get across?

245
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:37,582
A riddle?

246
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:40,151
Perhaps if
we answer it...

247
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:44,422
"What do you call
the life story
of a car?"

248
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:46,658
Uh, cartoon?

249
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,493
Vehicular memoirs?

250
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,328
Jade: Duh!

251
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,896
Autobiography!

252
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:58,503
I was about to say that.

253
00:13:58,505 --> 00:13:59,704
Toodle-oo!

254
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:00,939
Oopsy.

255
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:08,980
Come on,
come on!

256
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:15,620
Aah!

257
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:20,992
Jackie!
Water very hot!

258
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:22,727
I am not soup yet!

259
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,399
Jackie! Huhh!

260
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:36,207
Uhh!

261
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,042
And he spikes
the landing!

262
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,711
How do we
get across now?

263
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,779
Did you not
pay attention?

264
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,884
Uncle: We must
answer riddle.

265
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:47,719
No problemo.

266
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:49,854
"What is the beginning
of eternity...

267
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:51,956
"The end of time and space,

268
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,058
"the beginning
of every end,

269
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,061
and the end
of every place?"

270
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,931
No fair!
We got a brainbuster!

271
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:04,435
Valmont: At last.

272
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:09,007
My ticket
- to a life of luxury!

273
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,913
And so few have seen it,
it will never be missed.

274
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:16,414
Jade: End of every place...

275
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,749
End of every place.

276
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:18,917
The exit?

277
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:21,252
I wish this was
a lake of crosswords.

278
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,887
I am better at those.

279
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:24,856
Uncle: Eeeeeee!

280
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:25,924
Stub your toe?

281
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:27,759
The answer
to the riddle.

282
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:29,928
The end of time
and place.

283
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:34,399
In English, it is
the letter "e."

284
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,137
Well, uncle.

285
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:41,606
Uhh!

286
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:48,079
Just lift with your legs
and pack up that pachyderm!

287
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:49,480
Yes, master.

288
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:51,382
Uhh!

289
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:57,121
Creepy.

290
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:00,325
Uhh!

291
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:03,294
Funny how the guy
who can't remember

292
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,630
is trying to steal
the animal
that never forgets.

293
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,365
Stop, tohru!

294
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:09,300
If you remove
the elephant,

295
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:12,036
something very bad
will happen!

296
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:13,905
Which would be?

297
00:16:13,907 --> 00:16:15,807
Do not recall.

298
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:18,776
I'm expert in Chinese
mythology, not Indian.

299
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:21,312
don't listen.
Our enemies
are just trying

300
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,147
to trick you again.

301
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,382
Uhh!

302
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:25,516
Uhh!

303
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:27,218
Unnnhh!

304
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:30,188
Uh-oh.

305
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,672
Now I remember.

306
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,841
Stone sentinels
will destroy

307
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:52,410
whomever attempts
to steal elephant.

308
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,916
I never
touched it!

309
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:00,818
T!

310
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,033
Oooh!

311
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:21,806
Uncle! Your spell!

312
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:25,576
Do you not listen?

313
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:27,879
Uncle cannot make
amnesia antidote

314
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:29,847
without amnesia potion!

315
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:34,218
The turn-stone-into-mud spell.

316
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,888
Ah, that one
uncle can do.

317
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,257
And while you work
your magic...

318
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:44,929
I'll motion
for some potion.

319
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:55,840
Ha! The artful bungler.

320
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,708
Hand it over!

321
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,911
Say pretty please!

322
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:02,814
Jade, did you see
where uncle put
dried blowfish?

323
00:18:02,816 --> 00:18:04,449
Cannot complete
spell without it.

324
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:06,717
(Sighs)

325
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,287
Uncle, are you ok?

326
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:11,789
Uncle!
Uncle who?

327
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:12,957
Oh, boy.

328
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:15,159
Fare thee well,
you old goat!

329
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:18,062
Ah, I am a goat.

330
00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:20,264
No! You're uncle,

331
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,467
the only one
who can bring back tohru!

332
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:23,601
Baa!

333
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:26,771
Ecch! You're disgusting!

334
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,781
The harder they are...

335
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:38,716
The bigger they break.

336
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:11,082
Valmont: Many thanks
for your help, chan.

337
00:19:11,084 --> 00:19:13,117
A shame tohru must
render you senseless

338
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:16,120
so we may get on with
our crime unhindered.

339
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:18,156
Uh, tohru,
if you please.

340
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:19,757
No.

341
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,060
What do you mean, no?

342
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:26,631
You were not so loyal
to your loyal henchman.

343
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:31,135
Well, I--I was simply
hoping to duck away

344
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:33,938
and find a large mallet
with which to assist.

345
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:37,275
Something inside tells me
that Jackie is my friend.

346
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:41,145
And something inside
tells me

347
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:43,714
that you are forgetting
who is boss.

348
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:45,883
Hyaaah!

349
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:48,452
Bull's-eye!

350
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:50,154
Where am I?

351
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:51,489
The ballet.

352
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:53,958
You're doing
a fabulous <i> swan lake.</i>

353
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:03,067
Valmont can pirouette
all the way to prison.

354
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:04,202
Prison?

355
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:06,470
You need not worry,
tohru.

356
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:08,839
Elephants may remember
with their heads,

357
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:11,342
but you remembered us
with your heart.

358
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:12,543
Jade: Uh, Jackie?

359
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:13,678
Baa!

360
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,513
That's all he's gonna
remember us with

361
00:20:15,515 --> 00:20:18,950
if we don't figure out
how to get uncle's
memory back.

362
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,286
Ta-da!
- Baa!

363
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,690
Then perhaps we
should start doing some...

364
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:27,425
Research.
Research.

365
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:35,032
Hey, Jackie,
what's your favorite food?

366
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:36,200
Anything fast.

367
00:20:36,202 --> 00:20:37,868
I really don't
like to sit there.

368
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:40,238
12 people sit there,
they give you a soup.

369
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,274
You have to wait.
12 people all have a soup.

370
00:20:43,276 --> 00:20:44,809
The soup already cold.

371
00:20:44,811 --> 00:20:46,077
I like everything quick.

372
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,178
Done.
