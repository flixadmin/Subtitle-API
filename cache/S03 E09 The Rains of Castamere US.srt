1
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,585
Are you sure about this?

2
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,255
No.

3
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,258
It's dangerous.

4
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,637
If we take Tywin's castle from him,

5
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:21,140
the lords of Westeros
will realize he's not invincible.

6
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,144
Take his home,
take his gold, take his power.

7
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,604
Why are you telling me?

8
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:33,570
You begged me
not to send Theon to negotiate

9
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:36,739
with his father and I ignored your advice.

10
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:42,996
Now, Winterfell is burnt to the ground,
the North is overrun with ironborn,

11
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:45,248
and Bran and Rickon are gone.

12
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,669
So, Casterly Rock...

13
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,717
I'm asking your advice.

14
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,641
We have enough men?

15
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,981
If Walder Frey cooperates.

16
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,984
If Walder Frey cooperates.

17
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,700
If reinforcements arrive
from King's Landing...

18
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:23,286
before we take the castle...

19
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:28,541
we'll be caught
between Tywin's army and the sea.

20
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:36,132
We'll lose the war
and die the way Father died.

21
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,801
Or worse.

22
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,185
Show them how it feels
to lose what they love.

23
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,677
My honored guests...

24
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:26,641
be welcome
within my walls and at my table.

25
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:32,063
I extend to you
my hospitality and protection

26
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:35,066
in the light of the Seven.

27
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:37,360
We thank you
for your hospitality, my lord.

28
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:46,286
I have come to make my apologies,
my lord, and to beg your forgiveness.

29
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:49,539
Don't beg my forgiveness, Your Grace.

30
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,168
It wasn't me you spurned. It was my girls.

31
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:11,227
One of them was supposed to be queen.
Now, none of them are.

32
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:16,024
This is Arwyen, my daughter.

33
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,650
My daughter Walda,

34
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,194
my daughter Derwa,

35
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,613
my daughter Waldra.

36
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:32,665
My eldest granddaughters Ginia and Neila.

37
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:40,923
Serra and Sarra, granddaughters, twins.
You could have had either.

38
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,426
Could have had both for all I care.

39
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,637
My granddaughter Marianne.

40
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,474
My granddaughter Freya.

41
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:54,812
My granddaughter... Wertha.

42
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,775
W... Waldra.

43
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,529
-Waldina.
-I'm Merry.

44
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:04,572
Fine.

45
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:09,202
And here's my youngest daughter... Shirei,

46
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,913
though she hasn't bled yet.

47
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:14,832
Clearly, you don't have
the patience for all that.

48
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:17,293
My ladies,

49
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,172
all men should keep their word,
kings most of all.

50
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,760
I was pledged
to marry one of you and I broke that vow.

51
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:27,387
The fault is not with you.

52
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:30,556
And any man would be lucky
to have any one of you.

53
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,518
I did what I did not to slight you,

54
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,020
but because I loved another.

55
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:38,231
I know these words
cannot set right the wrong

56
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:40,566
I have done to you and your house.

57
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,777
I beg your forgiveness...

58
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,531
and pledge to do
all I can to make amends

59
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:49,492
so the Freys of the Crossing
and the Starks of Winterfell

60
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,077
may once again be friends.

61
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,086
Very good.

62
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,257
There she is.

63
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,092
Come closer.

64
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:08,678
Let me have a look at you.

65
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,353
Still can't see you.

66
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:19,897
Old eyes.

67
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,289
Love.

68
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,459
That's what
the Starks of Winterfell call it, eh?

69
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:44,881
Very honorable.

70
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:47,216
I call it a pretty face.

71
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:50,803
Very pretty.

72
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:54,807
Prettier than this lot, that's for sure.

73
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,186
Very shapely as well.

74
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:02,773
You try to hide her under that dress.

75
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,067
If you wanted to hide her,

76
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,820
you shouldn't have
brought her here in the first place.

77
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:17,914
I can always see
what's going on beneath a dress.

78
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,958
Been at this a long time.

79
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:27,506
I bet when you take that dress off,
everything stays right where it is.

80
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,467
Doesn't drop an inch.

81
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:34,222
Your king says he betrayed me for love.

82
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:39,393
I say he betrayed me
for firm tits and a tight fit.

83
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,939
And I can respect that.

84
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,192
When I was your age,

85
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:51,405
I'd have broken 50 oaths
to get into that without a second thought.

86
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:58,079
Well, I've enough room
in the hall for you lot.

87
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,374
We'll set up tents outside
with food and ale

88
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,000
for the rest of your men.

89
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:04,919
Thank you, my lord.

90
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,174
Well, let's get ready.

91
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,468
The wine will flow red...

92
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:15,137
and the music will play loud,

93
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:19,433
and we'll put this mess behind us.

94
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,320
-Where?
-There.

95
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:42,331
There. It's a back gate.

96
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,126
My men use it
when they visit Yunkai's bed slaves.

97
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:48,337
-Your men, but not you?
-I have no interest in slaves.

98
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,798
A man cannot make love to property.

99
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:57,179
This is where we enter the city.
Very few guards. They know me.

100
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,848
They let me inside.

101
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,058
We're not gonna sneak an army
through a back gate.

102
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,143
I kill the guards.

103
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,313
I take your two best men
and lead them through the back streets,

104
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:08,649
which I know well,
and open the front gates.

105
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,193
Then comes the army.

106
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,404
Once the walls are breached,
the city will fall in hours.

107
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:16,699
Or perhaps you'll lead
Grey Worm and me to the slaughter,

108
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,201
cutting the head off our army.

109
00:10:19,618 --> 00:10:21,787
The masters of Yunkai
will pay you your fee

110
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,873
and you won't have to split it
three ways 'cause you've already

111
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,416
slaughtered your partners.

112
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,877
You have a very suspicious mind.

113
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,880
In my experience,
only dishonest people think this way.

114
00:10:33,632 --> 00:10:35,301
You command the Unsullied.

115
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,345
What do you think?

116
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:51,817
You leave tonight.

117
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:53,569
Very good.

118
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:55,488
We'll prepare.

119
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,286
Ser Jorah.

120
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,040
You can use an extra sword.

121
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:10,169
You're the Queensguard, Ser Barristan.
Your place is by the queen.

122
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:15,174
If we are truly her loyal servants,
we'll do whatever needs to be done

123
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:18,928
no matter the cost, no matter our pride.

124
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:27,103
We're west of Castle Black,
but the Nightfort's closest to us.

125
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:30,314
It was the first castle on the Wall.

126
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:33,651
The Watch abandoned it
during the reign of King Jaehaerys I.

127
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:37,530
Too big. Impossible to maintain.

128
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:42,535
Other than Castle Black itself,
the Nightfort's the perfect castle for us.

129
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:48,666
It's got a secret sally port,
the Black Gate, as old as the Wall itself.

130
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:52,336
No one's used it in centuries most likely.

131
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:56,966
It leads through the Wall
right down into the Nightfort,

132
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:01,762
if one knows how to find it,
which, it just so happens, I do.

133
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:08,519
How do you know all that?

134
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:13,065
I read about it in a... a very old book.

135
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:22,950
You know all that
from staring at marks on paper?

136
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,411
Yes.

137
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,706
You're like a wizard.

138
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:48,017
Our father
used to tell us that no wildling ever

139
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,810
looked upon the Wall and lived.

140
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:52,271
Here we are.

141
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,107
Alive.

142
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:14,585
Remember what happens to children who run.

143
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,671
I'm your father and I'll do the talking.

144
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,767
Roads have gone right to hell,
haven't they?

145
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,852
Cracked three spokes this morning.

146
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,021
-Need a hand?
-Need about eight hands.

147
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:39,318
Got to get this salt pork
to the Twins in time for the wedding.

148
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,321
Many thanks.

149
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,450
Don't!

150
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,285
Don't kill him.

151
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,579
Dead rats don't squeak.

152
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:54,375
You're so dangerous, aren't you?
Saying scary things to little girls.

153
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,085
Killing little boys and old people.

154
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,254
A real hard man you are.

155
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:02,967
-More than anyone you know.
-You're wrong. I know a killer.

156
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:05,344
-A real killer.
-That so?

157
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:06,929
You'd be like a kitten to him.

158
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,056
He'd kill you with his little finger.

159
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:10,891
That him?

160
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,020
-No.
-Good.

161
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:17,898
Don't kill him.

162
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,608
Please.

163
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:21,902
Please don't.

164
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:29,451
You're very kind.
Someday it'll get you killed.

165
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,220
Where are we?

166
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,389
The Gift, I think.

167
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,642
Brandon the Builder
gave all this land south of the Wall

168
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:57,062
to the Night's Watch
for their sustenance and support.

169
00:14:57,896 --> 00:14:59,732
Maester Luwin taught me that.

170
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,069
Doesn't seem to be supporting
anyone at the moment.

171
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,239
It's good land and there's no war up here.

172
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,576
-Why leave?
-Wildlings.

173
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:12,703
Sorry.

174
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:17,541
But they come over the Wall
and raid, steal, carry off women.

175
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,835
Old Nan said
they turn your skull into a cup

176
00:15:19,918 --> 00:15:21,587
and make you
drink your own blood from it.

177
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,924
That's what Old Nan said.

178
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:27,843
There's a storm coming.

179
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,012
I don't see any...

180
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:36,560
It's as good a place to shelter as any.

181
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,899
We can drink some blood while we wait.

182
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,193
I don't need much.

183
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,957
Only one old man and eight good horses.

184
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:02,086
What's one old man doing
with eight horses?

185
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,587
He breeds them for the Watch.

186
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,631
How's he keep folks from stealing them?

187
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:07,800
The Watch protects him.

188
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,219
Not today they don't.

189
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,222
He's selling horses,
he's got some gold in there.

190
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:16,266
-And proper steel.
-Let's carve him up.

191
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,685
We just take the horses and go.

192
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,020
The old man's no threat.

193
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:24,775
-I keep telling you.
-He's an old man.

194
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:27,111
A spear through the heart's
a better way to die

195
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:30,030
than coughing up your last
with no one but your horses to hear.

196
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:34,618
The Watch might send
a few men looking for a horse thief.

197
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:37,871
They'll send a lot more
to hunt down murderers.

198
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,540
I hope so.

199
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,418
Killing crows in their castle is tough.

200
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:46,422
Killing them out here
in the open, that's what we do.

201
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:50,592
Spread out. Surround the hut and move in.

202
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:34,970
Ygritte!

203
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:38,557
Clear the barn!

204
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,723
No one's going to believe
you're a hog farmer if you eat them all.

205
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,267
Best part of the animal.

206
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,149
Don't worry. They're still there.

207
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:32,402
I know they're still there.

208
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:35,614
You check every five minutes
like you're afraid they're gonna move.

209
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,409
-I'm not afraid.
-Of course you are.

210
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,162
You're almost there...

211
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,582
and you're afraid you won't make it.

212
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,919
The closer you get,
the worse the fear gets.

213
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,297
No point in trying to hide
behind that face.

214
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:54,716
I know fear when I see it.

215
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,802
Seen it a lot.

216
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,639
I knew fear when I saw it in you.

217
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,143
You're afraid of fire.

218
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:09,398
When Beric's sword went up in flames,
you looked like a scared little girl.

219
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,444
And I know why too.

220
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,949
I heard what your brother did to you.

221
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,912
Pressed your face to the fire
like you're a nice juicy mutton chop.

222
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,043
That give you some ideas?

223
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,423
Might do.

224
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:37,217
Go ahead, then.

225
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,928
You might get away.

226
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:43,056
Might even make it there on your own.

227
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,726
They're just over the river.

228
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,688
The closest you've been
to family since Ilyn Payne

229
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,565
snipped your daddy's neck.

230
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:58,238
Someday I'm gonna put
a sword through your eye

231
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,948
and out the back of your skull.

232
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,017
How are we going to get past the Wall?

233
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,395
My uncle said
it's seven hundred feet high.

234
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:36,902
How did you get past it?

235
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,575
Got in a boat
and rowed past the Bay of Seals.

236
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,578
It would take us two months
to get to the Bay of Seals.

237
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:48,747
Some climb straight up the ice.

238
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:52,501
Even Hodor's not strong enough
to climb the Wall with me on his back.

239
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,585
Hodor.

240
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:57,881
Nineteen castles guard the Wall.

241
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,509
-Only three are still manned.
-Hodor!

242
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,804
One of those abandoned fortresses
will give us a way through.

243
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:06,139
My uncle said the gates
were sealed with ice and stone

244
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,599
when the castles were deserted.

245
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,685
Well, we'll have to open them up again.

246
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:15,065
There's a rider out there.

247
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:17,818
Just one?

248
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:20,278
-There's more.
-Hodor!

249
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,826
-It's just thunder, sweet giant.
-Hodor.

250
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,372
-I yield. I yield.
-Wildlings.

251
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:37,796
-Where's Shaggydog and Summer?
-Hunting.

252
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:40,632
Hodor!

253
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,176
-Quiet, Hodor.
-Hodor!

254
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,262
Make him shut up. If they hear us...

255
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:47,639
-Hush, Hodor. No more Hodoring.
-Hodor!

256
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,975
-Hodor!
-Hodor, calm down.

257
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:51,685
-You need to keep quiet.
-They're gonna hear us.

258
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,687
-Hodor.
-Hodor, be quiet.

259
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,398
Hodor!

260
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:57,607
-Hodor!
-Hodor, calm down.

261
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,860
-Hodor! Hodor!
-Hodor, be quiet!

262
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,468
What did you do?

263
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,511
Nothing.

264
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:28,597
I don't know.

265
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:35,228
What's that?

266
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:37,773
That's a horse dying.

267
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:49,868
Bring them over here.

268
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,580
That was the last of them.
The rest are dead.

269
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:56,166
I heard shouting up there.

270
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,085
Thunder.

271
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,630
I know the difference
between shouting and thunder.

272
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,298
Maybe it's ghosts.

273
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,311
That won't help you, Grandpa.

274
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:25,028
-Where you riding?
-Doesn't matter now, does it?

275
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,823
No, it doesn't matter now.

276
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:32,494
Cut his throat
or he'll tell the crows we're here.

277
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:40,418
You understand.

278
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,546
Let me stand at least.

279
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,465
Let me go with a bit of dignity.

280
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:52,597
Make the crow kill him.

281
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:59,062
You're one of us now. Prove it.

282
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,402
The wolves are out there.

283
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:12,617
I can't do it by choice.
I don't know how. It's...

284
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,078
It happens in my dreams.

285
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:18,123
You're a warg, Bran. It's in your blood.

286
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,419
-I can't.
-You just did with him.

287
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,546
A wolf is nothing compared to that.

288
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,431
She looks sharp.

289
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,025
Just do it.

290
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:47,611
Do it.

291
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,239
I told you. He's still one of them.

292
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:54,993
Go on, boy.

293
00:24:58,288 --> 00:24:59,247
Go on!

294
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:14,221
He's a crow. He'll always be a crow.
And here's his crow wife guarding him.

295
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:17,265
He'll stab us in the back
first chance he gets.

296
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:21,686
Kill him.

297
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,996
-He's one of them.
-No!

298
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,373
Do you hear me?

299
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,840
You're not gonna die for one of them.

300
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:54,094
Do it.

301
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:57,055
They'll find us if you don't.

302
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,878
You were right the whole time.

303
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:18,303
When you hear
a songbird's whistle, you come.

304
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,723
I'm a great whistler.
The greatest in the land.

305
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,731
Daario Naharis.

306
00:27:58,718 --> 00:27:59,886
That one was quick.

307
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:05,392
-There may be others.
-I doubt it.

308
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:08,478
The Yunkish prefer to let their slaves
do their fighting for them.

309
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:55,150
That's what you call a few guards?

310
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:21,801
Come on! What have you got, huh?

311
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:37,794
Lord Edmure...

312
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:42,632
I hope I'm not a disappointment to you.

313
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:53,935
You're a delight to me, my lady.

314
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:59,190
You may now cloak the bride
and bring her under your protection.

315
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:29,846
In the sight of the Seven,

316
00:31:30,888 --> 00:31:33,182
I hereby seal these two souls,

317
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:37,186
binding them as one... for eternity.

318
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,522
Look upon each other and say the words.

319
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:46,112
-Father, Smith, Warrior...
-Father, Smith, Warrior...

320
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:50,241
-...Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger...
-...Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger...

321
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:52,869
-...I am hers...
-...I am his...

322
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:54,662
-...and she is mine...
-...and he is mine...

323
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,539
-...from this day...
-...from this day...

324
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:58,666
-...until the end of my days.
-...until the end of my days.

325
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:06,174
-Is that safe?
-They're long gone.

326
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:12,847
You were right.

327
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,642
I can get inside
Summer's mind whenever I want.

328
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:17,602
Of course you can.

329
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:22,774
North of the Wall there are wildlings
who can control all sorts of animals.

330
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:26,110
But you did a lot more than that.

331
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,073
You got inside Hodor's mind.

332
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,535
They can't do that north of the Wall?

333
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:39,582
No one can do that... anywhere.

334
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:49,967
When I was looking
through Summer's eyes, I saw Jon.

335
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:52,095
-Where?
-He was with the wildlings.

336
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:54,555
They tried to kill him, but he got away.

337
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,224
He'll be heading back
to Castle Black, then.

338
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:58,226
That's where we should go.

339
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,728
For all we know,
Castle Black's already under attack.

340
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,271
If this many wildlings got through--

341
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:05,733
I already told you.
I'm not going north of the Wall.

342
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,486
Everything Jojen told me is true.

343
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:14,701
You saw what I did to Hodor.
I have to find the three-eyed raven.

344
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:17,120
-Listen to me, my Little Lord.
-Don't worry.

345
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:20,707
I'm not asking you to come with me.

346
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,293
It won't be safe for Rickon.

347
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:28,339
-Me? I'm coming with you.
-No.

348
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:32,552
You and Osha and Shaggydog
head for the Last Hearth.

349
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:35,304
The Umbers are our bannermen.
They'll protect you.

350
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:37,181
I'm coming with you.

351
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:41,269
I'm your brother. I have to protect you.

352
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,190
Right now I have to protect you.

353
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,986
Robb's at war
and I'm going beyond the Wall.

354
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:54,073
If something happens to us,
you're the heir to Winterfell.

355
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:59,120
Would you know
how to find the Last Hearth?

356
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:02,081
You southerners build
your big castles and you never move.

357
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:04,041
You're easy to find.

358
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,252
We're not southerners.

359
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,839
And I don't want to leave you.

360
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,467
Come here, little soldier.

361
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:16,971
You and me,
we're gonna have some adventures.

362
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:19,849
You don't have to do any of this.

363
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:25,396
Your family took me in and was good to me
when they had no cause to be.

364
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:31,736
We'll be fine, you and me.
The Umbers are great warriors.

365
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,280
Even I heard about them growing up.

366
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,325
They'll teach you how to swing a sword.

367
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:40,244
I know how to swing a sword.

368
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:50,546
You're leaving now?
It's the middle of the night.

369
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,381
I learned to walk in darkness.

370
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:56,677
Say your good-byes, little man.

371
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,187
Keep this one safe.

372
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:10,650
He means the world to me.

373
00:35:32,129 --> 00:35:33,840
We've been waiting a long time.

374
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:37,718
Haven't we?

375
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:43,391
I don't know, you tell me.
How long does it take to sack a city?

376
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:53,526
It was just as you said.

377
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,404
They did not believe
until it was too late.

378
00:35:57,196 --> 00:36:01,951
Their slave soldiers threw down
their spears and surrendered.

379
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:09,083
And Daario Naharis?

380
00:36:30,187 --> 00:36:31,898
The city is yours, My Queen.

381
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,256
They're good, aren't they?

382
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,258
They ought to be
because they cost enough.

383
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:07,892
Look at the crowd there.

384
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:16,859
He complained about this marriage
the entire ride from Riverrun,

385
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:20,863
-and now look at him.
-The gods love to reward a fool.

386
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:23,157
-Uncle...
-What?

387
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,785
He's my nephew. I love him.

388
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:28,579
And he's a damned fool.

389
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,544
Don't you drink, Lord Bolton?

390
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:39,882
-Never do, my lady. Dulls the senses.
-That's the point.

391
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:43,552
-Didn't you marry one of these Frey girls?
-Aye.

392
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:46,555
Lord Walder let me choose
any of his granddaughters

393
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:49,767
and promised me
the girl's weight in silver as a dowry.

394
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:52,144
So I have a fat young bride.

395
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:58,150
-I hope she makes you very happy.
-Well, she's made me very rich.

396
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:02,905
Pardon, my lord, my lady.
I need to find a tree to piss on.

397
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:09,078
My mother's alone with Roose Bolton.
I should rescue her.

398
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:12,665
Your mother is less in need of rescue
than any woman I've ever met.

399
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:16,127
Be kind.
She's finally starting to like you.

400
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,088
And I like her.

401
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:21,340
But if she had her way,

402
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:23,801
I would be
back in Volantis playing my harp

403
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:27,096
and you would be
sitting over there eating blackberries

404
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:29,015
out of Roslin Frey's hand.

405
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:31,559
Perhaps I've made a terrible mistake.

406
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:36,939
Striking your king is an act of treason.

407
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:41,736
No, don't.

408
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:45,156
Don't insult them.

409
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,076
Your Grace.

410
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:59,712
The septon has prayed his prayers,

411
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,548
some words were said,

412
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:07,386
and Lord Edmure has wrapped
my daughter in a cloak.

413
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:11,265
But... they are not yet man and wife.

414
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:14,477
A sword needs a sheath.

415
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:23,444
-And a wedding needs a bedding.
-Yeah!

416
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,280
-What does my sire say?
-Yeah!

417
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:29,366
-To bed! To bed! To bed!
-To bed! To bed! To bed!

418
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,243
-To bed! To bed! To bed!
-To bed! To bed! To bed!

419
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:33,245
-To bed! To bed! To bed!
-To bed! To bed! To bed!

420
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:38,501
If you think the time is right,
Lord Walder, by all means...

421
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:41,378
let us bed them.

422
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:42,797
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

423
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,049
-To bed! To bed! To bed!
-To bed! To bed! To bed!

424
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:47,468
-To bed! To bed! To bed!
-To bed! To bed! To bed!

425
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,470
-To bed! To bed! To bed!
-To bed! To bed! To bed!

426
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:51,472
-To bed! To bed! To bed!
-To bed! To bed! To bed!

427
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:53,390
-To bed! To bed! To bed!
-To bed! To bed! To bed!

428
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:55,935
-To bed! To bed! To bed!
-To bed! To bed! To bed!

429
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:57,561
-To bed! To bed!
-Go on!

430
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:19,750
Careful now, ladies.

431
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:23,295
Once you set that monster free,
there's no caging him again.

432
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,966
-To bed! To bed! To bed!
-To bed! To bed! To bed!

433
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:29,385
-To bed! To bed! To bed!
-To bed! To bed! To bed!

434
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:31,095
-To bed! To bed! To bed!
-To bed! To bed! To bed!

435
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:35,307
-Poor girl.
-Every bride suffers the same.

436
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:40,104
-I'm sure you endured yours with grace.
-Ned forbade it.

437
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,399
He said it wouldn't be right
if he broke a man's jaw

438
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:44,692
on our wedding night.

439
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,536
That is a very strange custom.

440
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,582
I suppose it does seem strange
from a foreigner's perspective.

441
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:01,375
It seems normal to you?

442
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:03,794
It's a tradition.

443
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,423
Without the bedding ceremony,

444
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:10,509
there's no real proof the lord and lady
consummated their marriage.

445
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:14,555
No, but there are
other ways of providing proof.

446
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:18,267
Boy or girl?

447
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:22,646
I don't know.

448
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:26,066
But if it's a boy,
I know what we should name him.

449
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,234
Do you?

450
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,780
It seems to me the father
should have some say in his son's naming.

451
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:32,990
Eddard.

452
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:40,456
Don't you want to teach
little Ned Stark how to ride horses?

453
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:42,666
I do.

454
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:07,251
-Where are you going?
-Got salt pork for the feast.

455
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:08,919
The feast is over.

456
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:14,883
-Doesn't sound like it's over.
-If I tell you it's over, it's over.

457
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:18,262
Turn this cart around
and get the hell out of here.

458
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:20,848
Got pig's feet too.

459
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:26,103
Are you soft in the head?
Turn this cart around.

460
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:40,117
Your Grace...

461
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:51,879
I feel I've been remiss in my duties.

462
00:43:52,629 --> 00:43:56,050
I've given you meat and wine and music,

463
00:43:56,133 --> 00:44:01,388
but I haven't shown you
the hospitality you deserve.

464
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:07,436
My king has married
and I owe my new queen a wedding gift.

465
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:13,901
Robb!

466
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:04,243
Aye, you ready
to head home to Winterfell, right?

467
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:10,666
-Feast over yet, is it?
-Aye, it's over.

468
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:42,948
Follow him.

469
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:47,035
Aim!

470
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:18,108
It's too late.

471
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:03,237
The King in the North arises.

472
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:26,218
Lord Walder!

473
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:28,428
Lord Walder, enough!

474
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:30,847
Let it end!

475
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:34,059
Please.

476
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:36,520
He is my son.

477
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:39,731
My first son.

478
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:42,025
Let him go and I swear
that we will forget this.

479
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:46,530
I swear it by the old gods and new.
We will take no vengeance.

480
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:49,825
You already swore me
one oath right here in my castle.

481
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,870
You swore by all the gods
your son would marry my daughter!

482
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:57,291
Take me for a hostage, but let Robb go.

483
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:59,126
Robb, get up.

484
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:01,253
Get up and walk out.

485
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:03,213
Please!

486
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,633
Please!

487
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:11,638
And why would I let him do that?

488
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:19,980
On my honor as a Tully,
on my honor as a Stark,

489
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:25,736
let him go...
or I will cut your wife's throat.

490
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:36,204
I'll find another.

491
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:41,209
Mother...

492
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:45,464
The Lannisters send their regards.
