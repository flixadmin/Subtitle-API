1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,546
- Where are we?
- At the Dawn of Time.

2
00:00:06,707 --> 00:00:07,708
Ah!

3
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:11,710
Well, look who's finally...

4
00:00:11,712 --> 00:00:13,538
Ah!

5
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,800
- Awake.
- Alex.

6
00:00:15,803 --> 00:00:17,455
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

7
00:00:17,457 --> 00:00:18,891
No, no, no, it's okay. It's okay.

8
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:21,328
Are you okay? Did you have a bad dream?

9
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,765
I don't know. I'm...

10
00:00:23,767 --> 00:00:26,029
How did I get here?

11
00:00:26,031 --> 00:00:28,553
Well, you fell asleep
in front of the TV,

12
00:00:28,555 --> 00:00:30,207
and you just looked so peaceful,

13
00:00:30,209 --> 00:00:32,339
so I didn't have the heart
to move you to the bed.

14
00:00:32,341 --> 00:00:35,473
The... the Dawn of Time.

15
00:00:35,475 --> 00:00:37,388
Dawn of Time.

16
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,275
Is that what you were
watching before you nodded off?

17
00:00:39,277 --> 00:00:42,482
Wait. What is...

18
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:45,178
This isn't right.

19
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,745
Well, I mean, it's
right, but it's not right

20
00:00:46,747 --> 00:00:48,673
- because it's right.
- Uh-huh.

21
00:00:48,676 --> 00:00:50,720
I see the White Martian did
a number on you last night.

22
00:00:50,722 --> 00:00:51,750
White Martian?

23
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:53,621
White Martian.

24
00:00:53,623 --> 00:00:54,816
Listen, I gotta run.

25
00:00:54,819 --> 00:00:56,711
Kelly and I are trying out
a new indoor rowing class

26
00:00:56,713 --> 00:01:00,628
in downtown, so are you...
you sure you're okay?

27
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,543
I'm fine.

28
00:01:02,545 --> 00:01:04,545
I'm fine.

29
00:01:04,547 --> 00:01:05,548
Okay.

30
00:01:07,724 --> 00:01:10,334
- Alex.
- Yeah?

31
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:12,292
I love you.

32
00:01:12,294 --> 00:01:13,989
I love you too.

33
00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:21,493
- Nia.
- Kara.

34
00:01:21,496 --> 00:01:23,042
It's good to hear your voice.

35
00:01:23,044 --> 00:01:24,739
Well, it would be better to see my face.

36
00:01:24,741 --> 00:01:27,006
Where are you? The
ceremony's about to start.

37
00:01:27,009 --> 00:01:28,008
Ceremony?

38
00:01:28,011 --> 00:01:30,528
They're awarding the Nobel
Peace Prize any minute.

39
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,680
Don't worry, I saved you a seat,

40
00:01:32,683 --> 00:01:36,168
but that lady from the gazette
is giving me angry eyes.

41
00:01:37,121 --> 00:01:39,319
If you miss this, Andrea's
gonna blow a gasket.

42
00:01:40,322 --> 00:01:41,582
Please take your seats.

43
00:01:41,584 --> 00:01:43,541
Good timing.

44
00:01:43,543 --> 00:01:46,422
Hey, uh, I had a really
weird dream last night.

45
00:01:46,425 --> 00:01:48,414
Could you maybe help me interpret it?

46
00:01:48,417 --> 00:01:50,113
What happened?

47
00:01:50,115 --> 00:01:53,738
Oh, uh, the world ended,
but, like, all the worlds.

48
00:01:54,858 --> 00:01:56,423
All of them.

49
00:01:56,425 --> 00:01:58,993
That's dramatic even for us.

50
00:01:59,918 --> 00:02:02,386
And now I'm proud to
introduce the winner

51
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:04,602
of this year's Nobel Peace Prize,

52
00:02:04,605 --> 00:02:06,040
Lex Luthor.

53
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:14,615
Nia, Nia, am I still dreaming?

54
00:02:14,617 --> 00:02:15,761
I know, right.

55
00:02:15,764 --> 00:02:17,835
It is so great when this
award goes to someone

56
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:19,446
who actually deserves it.

57

58
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:37,247
We live in dangerous times.

59
00:02:37,249 --> 00:02:40,467
Earth is a dangerous place.

60
00:02:40,469 --> 00:02:44,341
I suppose that's why people
love superheroes so much.

61
00:02:44,343 --> 00:02:48,891
The power, the chutzpah
of someone who can

62
00:02:48,894 --> 00:02:51,175
fly faster than a speeding bullet.

63
00:02:52,307 --> 00:02:55,917
But that's what makes this so special.

64
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:57,441
I don't have any powers.

65
00:02:57,443 --> 00:03:00,139
I can't leap tall
buildings in a single bound,

66
00:03:00,141 --> 00:03:03,907
but I have dedicated my life to fighting

67
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:07,520
on the side of humanity,
and to be recognized for that

68
00:03:07,522 --> 00:03:09,653
is more than I can put into words,

69
00:03:09,655 --> 00:03:12,230
so I will just say

70
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:15,180
I stand with mankind.

71
00:03:20,288 --> 00:03:22,245
I'm gonna throw up.

72
00:03:22,248 --> 00:03:23,682
Are you still feeling weird?

73
00:03:23,685 --> 00:03:24,801
We should get you to the med bay.

74
00:03:24,803 --> 00:03:26,273
You did not seem okay this morning.

75
00:03:26,276 --> 00:03:28,715
Oh, no, no, I'm fine.
I'm just disoriented.

76
00:03:28,717 --> 00:03:32,937
The world is... what
was Lex doing up there?

77
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:34,939
Well, they keep throwing
all these awards at him.

78
00:03:34,941 --> 00:03:36,549
He doesn't usually
accept them in person,

79
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:38,116
but this one meant a lot to him.

80
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:39,900
People think he's a good guy?

81
00:03:39,902 --> 00:03:42,152
Kara, we're talking about Lex Luther.

82
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:43,621
He's the best guy.

83
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:46,689
No, he's not. He's a
psychopathic lunatic.

84
00:03:46,692 --> 00:03:49,867
What? No, he's the boss.

85
00:03:49,869 --> 00:03:52,130
And he's your number one supporter.

86
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:53,527
I mean, besides Lena.

87
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,177
And all the times that they
defended you to the president...

88
00:03:56,179 --> 00:03:57,529
what has gotten into you.

89
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:02,008
Hang on, what-wha... wait,
did you just say "boss"?

90
00:04:08,017 --> 00:04:09,756
I don't...

91
00:04:09,758 --> 00:04:12,106
Oh, no, no, no, no.

92
00:04:12,108 --> 00:04:14,761
Alex, are we...

93
00:04:14,763 --> 00:04:15,893
Supergirl.

94
00:04:15,895 --> 00:04:17,198
J'onn.

95
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,026
I know you must be confused.

96
00:04:19,028 --> 00:04:22,029
I was too, but it happened.

97
00:04:22,031 --> 00:04:25,032
It all happened.

98
00:04:25,034 --> 00:04:26,904
Why are we the only two that remember?

99
00:04:26,906 --> 00:04:28,601
What are we that they are not?

100
00:04:28,603 --> 00:04:30,560
Paragons.

101
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:32,562
We helped Oliver restart the universe.

102
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:35,826
And this is the result.

103
00:04:35,828 --> 00:04:37,697
I suspect there will
be more such changes

104
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:39,569
that are yet to reveal themselves.

105
00:04:40,749 --> 00:04:42,789
Well, there's something
happening downtown.

106
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,791
- I'll send a team.
- No, no, no, it's fine.

107
00:04:44,793 --> 00:04:46,619
I need to punch something.

108
00:05:03,377 --> 00:05:04,378
Hey.

109
00:05:05,932 --> 00:05:07,987
Look who came to join the fun.

110
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:10,208
I'm sorry. Who are you?

111
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,166
Weather Witch.

112
00:05:12,168 --> 00:05:14,821
And you are no match for my wrath.

113
00:05:16,695 --> 00:05:19,402
Oh, look, I'm having not so great a day,

114
00:05:19,405 --> 00:05:20,891
which is actually your bad luck.

115
00:05:21,722 --> 00:05:22,873
Ugh.

116
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,006
Ah!

117
00:05:25,296 --> 00:05:27,616
Sorry, she's one of mine.

118
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:29,880
Well, what's she doing on my Earth?

119
00:05:29,882 --> 00:05:31,347
What?

120
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:34,013
Wait, wait, what are
you doing on my Earth?

121
00:05:34,016 --> 00:05:37,322
Your Earth? This is my Earth.

122
00:05:37,324 --> 00:05:38,978
- I thought...
- I thought...

123
00:05:40,762 --> 00:05:44,851
Supergirl, Flash, I just
love it when you guys team up.

124
00:05:44,853 --> 00:05:47,246
Would you sign this for me please?

125
00:05:47,249 --> 00:05:51,105
- Oh, sure, um...
- Wait, you know both of us?

126
00:05:51,108 --> 00:05:54,469
And it's normal to see us together?

127
00:05:54,471 --> 00:05:56,074
Well, normally you'd also have

128
00:05:56,077 --> 00:05:57,994
Green Arrow and a Legend or two.

129
00:05:57,997 --> 00:05:59,977
Last year, even Batwoman joined in.

130
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,869
Make that out to Marv. M-A-R-V.

131
00:06:02,871 --> 00:06:04,218
- Thank you.
- Marv, M-A-R-V.

132
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,872
You're welcome. Marv,

133
00:06:05,874 --> 00:06:08,199
as far as you know,
how long have Supergirl and I

134
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:12,285
and all the rest of us
been working together

135
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:15,054
on this Earth?

136
00:06:15,057 --> 00:06:17,275
Uh, since forever?

137
00:06:23,148 --> 00:06:25,648
_

138
00:06:36,332 --> 00:06:37,590
The hell?

139
00:06:43,558 --> 00:06:45,908
Call for help. Now!

140
00:06:55,096 --> 00:06:57,307
_

141
00:07:03,794 --> 00:07:05,361
How did I get back here?

142
00:07:18,809 --> 00:07:20,333
Ray, where are you?

143
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,327
- Hey, Cap, over here.
- Ray.

144
00:07:25,338 --> 00:07:27,512
Hey, hey.

145
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:29,427
Hey, you okay?

146
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,799
Not that I'm ever one to question a hug.

147
00:07:30,801 --> 00:07:32,691
What was the last
thing that you remember?

148
00:07:32,693 --> 00:07:35,563
Uh, portaling to this
location on your orders.

149
00:07:35,565 --> 00:07:38,436
You don't remember coming
here for trivia night

150
00:07:38,438 --> 00:07:41,047
and being teleported to
an alternate Waverider

151
00:07:41,049 --> 00:07:42,991
to stop the multiverse
from being destroyed?

152
00:07:42,994 --> 00:07:44,728
Wait, was there a crossover?

153
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:46,531
Were we invited? Did we win?

154
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:48,576
That's certainly how it looks.

155
00:07:48,578 --> 00:07:49,981
Did you just hear...

156
00:07:52,365 --> 00:07:54,060
It's good to see you're both safe.

157
00:07:54,062 --> 00:07:56,497
J'onn, that's a neat trick.

158
00:07:56,499 --> 00:07:59,587
Wait, you know J'onn Jonnz
from Supergirl's Earth?

159
00:07:59,589 --> 00:08:00,915
Of course I know J'onn.

160
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:02,590
Wait, go back.

161
00:08:02,592 --> 00:08:04,592
Supergirl has her own Earth?

162
00:08:04,594 --> 00:08:06,292
Not anymore.

163
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:10,554
When we restarted the
universe, our worlds combined,

164
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:13,168
and only we Paragons know
it was ever any different.

165
00:08:14,387 --> 00:08:16,154
Okay, sorry, guy, I'm
a little lost here.

166
00:08:16,157 --> 00:08:17,985
Here, this'll be faster.

167
00:08:21,871 --> 00:08:25,220
Whoa, there was a multiverse.

168
00:08:25,223 --> 00:08:26,397
It all got destroyed.

169
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:27,441
There's an evil Batman,

170
00:08:27,443 --> 00:08:29,205
and there's a me that's a super me?

171
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,424
It'll take him some time

172
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,011
to assimilate to this new paradigm.

173
00:08:32,013 --> 00:08:34,020
I have been going from city to city

174
00:08:34,023 --> 00:08:36,894
restoring the memories of
our compatriots as best I can.

175
00:08:36,897 --> 00:08:38,507
And what about Oliver?

176
00:08:39,629 --> 00:08:41,586
There's been no sign of him.

177
00:08:44,504 --> 00:08:45,749
Hey, where are you going?

178
00:08:45,752 --> 00:08:47,461
To find my friend.

179
00:08:51,772 --> 00:08:52,947
Oliver!

180
00:08:57,255 --> 00:08:58,517
Oliver!

181
00:09:11,226 --> 00:09:12,227
Sara.

182
00:09:14,447 --> 00:09:15,837
I need to talk to you guys...

183
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:16,840
We already know.

184
00:09:18,581 --> 00:09:20,538
We already know.

185
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,843
Martian J'onn came by

186
00:09:21,845 --> 00:09:23,891
and gave us a splitting headache.

187
00:09:25,675 --> 00:09:27,460
It all happened, didn't it?

188
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:31,592
He died twice, Sara.

189
00:09:31,594 --> 00:09:34,508
Yeah.

190
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:38,384
I wasn't there both times.

191
00:09:40,516 --> 00:09:42,647
Both times I failed him.

192
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:45,301
- Dig, you...
- I'm so sorry.

193
00:09:45,303 --> 00:09:46,304
It's okay.

194
00:09:48,481 --> 00:09:50,047
I wasn't there.

195
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,443
He was my brother.

196
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:57,575
I know.

197
00:09:57,577 --> 00:09:59,533
Listen to me.

198
00:09:59,535 --> 00:10:02,493
Look, we all... we all died,

199
00:10:02,495 --> 00:10:06,279
the entire universe, the multiverse.

200
00:10:06,281 --> 00:10:08,499
Now we're back

201
00:10:08,501 --> 00:10:11,373
that means, Oliver,
he might be back too.

202
00:10:15,551 --> 00:10:16,987
After the brain dump...

203
00:10:18,728 --> 00:10:21,337
We had Felicity run a global search.

204
00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:23,644
I mean, nobody's better
at finding people,

205
00:10:23,646 --> 00:10:26,081
but they've got to be here to be found.

206
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,735
You don't know.

207
00:10:27,737 --> 00:10:31,347
Look, when Oliver died,
he became something else.

208
00:10:31,349 --> 00:10:33,833
He... he called it the Spectre.

209
00:10:33,836 --> 00:10:36,622
Then maybe, Felicity, she just
can't find him in that form.

210
00:10:39,314 --> 00:10:41,133
Dig, she just can't
find him in this form...

211
00:10:41,136 --> 00:10:42,573
Sara...

212
00:10:47,929 --> 00:10:49,539
Sara, gone is gone.

213
00:10:50,586 --> 00:10:51,778
He's gone.

214
00:11:20,573 --> 00:11:23,051
J'onn, what are you doing here?

215
00:11:23,053 --> 00:11:24,270
Is something wrong?

216
00:11:24,272 --> 00:11:28,056
Not anymore, no thanks to him.

217
00:11:28,058 --> 00:11:29,936
Do you know why he's like this?

218
00:11:31,714 --> 00:11:33,396
And now so do you.

219
00:11:34,674 --> 00:11:35,760
Oliver!

220
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,030
This is all his fault.

221
00:11:45,032 --> 00:11:47,249
He's the one who
released the Anti-Monitor.

222
00:11:47,251 --> 00:11:49,948
He paid dearly for his misjudgment,

223
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,733
but not as much as some others.

224
00:11:52,735 --> 00:11:54,607
Ah! Ah.

225
00:11:56,391 --> 00:11:58,522
What happened? Where am I?

226
00:11:58,524 --> 00:12:00,436
How did I get here?

227
00:12:00,438 --> 00:12:03,572
You nearly damned us
all to hell, Nash Wells!

228
00:12:05,531 --> 00:12:06,841
Well, that's an introduction.

229
00:12:06,844 --> 00:12:08,690
Who the hell are you and
what are you talking about?

230
00:12:08,692 --> 00:12:09,794
You need to stay calm.

231
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:11,404
Your system's still recovering.

232
00:12:11,406 --> 00:12:13,798
You... you need to calm down.

233
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,277
I'm not gonna stay here,

234
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,075
get lectured by some
government suit who...

235
00:12:24,637 --> 00:12:25,638
God.

236
00:12:28,858 --> 00:12:31,816
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

237
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:35,622
And so you should be.
This is all your fault!

238
00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:38,823
It is my fault.

239
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:41,826
But you... you solved it.

240
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:43,809
You and the others,
you saved the universe.

241
00:12:43,812 --> 00:12:45,248
You fixed my mistake.

242
00:12:46,489 --> 00:12:47,794
Right?

243
00:12:48,661 --> 00:12:50,574
Not entirely.

244
00:12:55,015 --> 00:12:56,318
It's true.

245
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,756
We all live on the same Earth now.

246
00:12:58,758 --> 00:13:00,018
Our Earths must have merged

247
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,367
when we helped Oliver
reboot the universe.

248
00:13:01,369 --> 00:13:02,716
I can't believe it.

249
00:13:02,718 --> 00:13:04,109
What are you guys doing here?

250
00:13:04,111 --> 00:13:05,763
I had to see if it was true.

251
00:13:05,765 --> 00:13:08,461
The DEO, CatCo, all of National City

252
00:13:08,463 --> 00:13:10,681
is on this Earth now.
Even Argo's up there.

253
00:13:10,683 --> 00:13:13,727
We did it. We saved everyone.

254
00:13:13,729 --> 00:13:15,555
Not everyone.

255
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,520
Oliver.

256
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:26,394
He didn't make it.

257
00:13:28,788 --> 00:13:30,701
Guess we just have to face facts.

258
00:13:30,703 --> 00:13:34,139
No, that's not... that's...

259
00:13:34,141 --> 00:13:37,187
Why did he give everyone else
a fresh start but not himself?

260
00:13:38,754 --> 00:13:41,276
Maybe this was the only way, Kara.

261
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:43,716
Maybe his sacrifice made
all of this possible.

262
00:13:47,067 --> 00:13:48,895
Him for us.

263
00:13:53,304 --> 00:13:55,072
- What is that?
- We're being attacked.

264
00:13:55,075 --> 00:13:56,074
By who?

265
00:14:01,647 --> 00:14:03,951
You wouldn't believe it if I told you.

266
00:14:13,963 --> 00:14:16,398
It's a giant Beebo.

267
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,793
Beebo hungry.

268
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:28,347
How the hell did Beebo get here?

269
00:14:28,349 --> 00:14:29,419
Isn't the more pressing question

270
00:14:29,421 --> 00:14:31,704
why is there a giant Beebo
walking down the street?

271
00:14:31,707 --> 00:14:33,917
Well, this wouldn't be the first time.

272
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:35,699
- It's a long story.
- That's right.

273
00:14:35,702 --> 00:14:37,387
Wally told us about
the time you guys used

274
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,345
those totems to turn
yourselves into a giant Beebo

275
00:14:39,347 --> 00:14:40,663
to fight a time demon.

276
00:14:40,665 --> 00:14:41,977
I guess it's not a long story.

277
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,023
Could that be what's happening here?

278
00:14:44,026 --> 00:14:45,330
Ava, Nate, you there?

279
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,521
I need a twenty on Behrad and his totem.

280
00:14:47,524 --> 00:14:49,055
Sara, are you okay?

281
00:14:49,058 --> 00:14:51,561
Ray called us to tell us you
were on some special mission.

282
00:14:51,564 --> 00:14:52,694
But he's a little flimsy with the deets,

283
00:14:52,696 --> 00:14:54,086
so what's the haps, Cap?

284
00:14:54,089 --> 00:14:56,490
Yeah, we've been busy
saving the multiverse.

285
00:14:56,493 --> 00:14:58,943
You got shanghaied into
another crossover, didn't you?

286
00:14:58,946 --> 00:15:02,076
Hmm, yeah, kind of.

287
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:03,382
Whoa, whoa. Did they kidnap you?

288
00:15:03,384 --> 00:15:05,029
This is a classic crossover move.

289
00:15:05,032 --> 00:15:07,443
We tell 'em we're too
busy, they commit a felony.

290
00:15:07,446 --> 00:15:10,716
Guys, Beebo is rampaging
through Star City.

291
00:15:10,719 --> 00:15:12,110
Does Behrad have his totem?

292
00:15:12,113 --> 00:15:13,852
Beebo? That doesn't make any sense.

293
00:15:13,855 --> 00:15:15,594
You would need all six
totems to make that happen,

294
00:15:15,596 --> 00:15:17,117
and Behrad's definitely
still on the ship.

295
00:15:17,119 --> 00:15:18,118
All right, I gotta go.

296
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,190
Wait, do you need help?

297
00:15:19,193 --> 00:15:20,409
No, stay in DC.

298
00:15:20,412 --> 00:15:21,409
I don't want any more of my people

299
00:15:21,411 --> 00:15:23,078
getting roped into this mess.

300
00:15:23,081 --> 00:15:24,516
Well, here's the thing.

301
00:15:24,518 --> 00:15:27,997
One of us is kind of already there.

302
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,521
Who?

303
00:15:29,523 --> 00:15:32,219
And who should I make this out to?

304
00:15:32,221 --> 00:15:33,394
Doris.

305
00:15:33,396 --> 00:15:35,875
I'm such a huge fan, Rebecca.

306
00:15:35,877 --> 00:15:37,877
I mean, what should I call you?

307
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:39,531
Rebecca's fine.

308
00:15:39,533 --> 00:15:41,707
To Doris.

309
00:15:41,709 --> 00:15:45,229
Thanks for the passion, love...

310
00:15:59,596 --> 00:16:00,943
Fur ball.

311
00:16:00,945 --> 00:16:02,771
Oh my.

312
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:09,604
Oh, man, I can't believe
Nate's gonna miss seeing Beebo.

313
00:16:09,606 --> 00:16:11,388
He's gonna be so jealous.

314
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,607
Here he comes.

315
00:16:12,609 --> 00:16:13,788
What's the plan?

316
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:16,112
Smile, Beebo.

317
00:16:16,115 --> 00:16:17,264
What?

318
00:16:17,266 --> 00:16:18,252
Are you...

319
00:16:18,255 --> 00:16:19,832
Oh, sorry, you guys
don't wanna be in it?

320
00:16:19,834 --> 00:16:21,198
Oh, bad timing.

321
00:16:21,201 --> 00:16:23,052
Is this seriously happening right now?

322
00:16:23,054 --> 00:16:24,401
Well, maybe it's a good thing.

323
00:16:24,404 --> 00:16:25,917
Guess we could all use the distraction.

324
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:28,565
Right, compartmentalize,
focus on the work, good idea.

325
00:16:28,568 --> 00:16:30,151
Guys, Beebo's still on the warpath.

326
00:16:30,154 --> 00:16:32,763
Any suggestions on how we take him down?

327
00:16:32,766 --> 00:16:34,338
Hey, what is that?

328
00:16:34,341 --> 00:16:36,341
That's a utility truck. Why?

329
00:16:36,344 --> 00:16:39,049
Are you guys ready to
do a tag team trip up?

330
00:16:39,052 --> 00:16:40,573
Yeah. What do you have in mind?

331
00:16:40,576 --> 00:16:42,958
All right, Supergirl,
Atom, keep him contained.

332
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:44,613
Flash, use those cables to your left.

333
00:16:44,615 --> 00:16:45,788
- Got it.
- All right.

334
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:47,050
Can do.

335
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,577
Beebo want cuddles!

336
00:16:53,276 --> 00:16:54,580
Is this actually happening?

337
00:16:54,582 --> 00:16:56,233
Is this what all the
crossovers are like?

338
00:16:56,235 --> 00:16:57,518
Yes and not exactly.

339
00:16:57,521 --> 00:16:59,671
I'm never letting my child
watch that show again.

340
00:16:59,674 --> 00:17:00,971
Done.

341
00:17:00,974 --> 00:17:02,283
All right, now get him moving.

342
00:17:02,285 --> 00:17:04,143
Die, fur ball!

343
00:17:04,154 --> 00:17:05,299
Mick?

344
00:17:05,302 --> 00:17:08,166
That blue bastard
ruined my book signing!

345
00:17:09,248 --> 00:17:11,854
Okay, everybody get ready to pull.

346
00:17:11,857 --> 00:17:13,161
Here, take it. Take it.

347
00:17:13,164 --> 00:17:15,034
Ow.

348
00:17:15,037 --> 00:17:17,690
- The bigger they are...
- The harder they...

349
00:17:17,692 --> 00:17:19,126
Fall!

350
00:17:19,128 --> 00:17:20,257
Ah!

351
00:17:20,259 --> 00:17:21,433
- Ugh.
- Whoa, whoa.

352
00:17:21,435 --> 00:17:24,479
Oh, thanks Supergirl.

353
00:17:24,481 --> 00:17:26,438
What the hell?

354
00:17:29,356 --> 00:17:30,833
Guys, something's off.

355
00:17:30,835 --> 00:17:32,444
I'm not reading any known elements,

356
00:17:32,446 --> 00:17:33,662
nothing off the periodic table.

357
00:17:37,712 --> 00:17:38,885
I don't think the rules apply

358
00:17:38,887 --> 00:17:40,487
to 50-foot talking plush toy.

359
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,496
Hey, hey, Kate's here too.

360
00:17:42,499 --> 00:17:44,718
That's... uh, sorry.
What were you saying?

361
00:17:46,503 --> 00:17:48,634
It's unnatural.

362
00:17:48,636 --> 00:17:49,679
Alien?

363
00:17:49,682 --> 00:17:51,114
- Hey.
- Or magic?

364
00:17:51,116 --> 00:17:52,507
Sara, don't you and
the Legends deal with

365
00:17:52,509 --> 00:17:53,943
that kind of stuff all the time?

366
00:17:53,945 --> 00:17:55,968
Or maybe it's just
here to keep us talking.

367
00:17:55,971 --> 00:17:57,643
A diversion.

368
00:17:57,645 --> 00:17:59,079
But for what?

369
00:17:59,081 --> 00:18:00,646
I know what I'd do.

370
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:07,696
It is finally time
for Sargon the Sorcerer

371
00:18:07,698 --> 00:18:10,656
to claim his reward!

372
00:18:10,658 --> 00:18:13,702
Oh, and buy that beautiful
timeshare in Bogota.

373
00:18:16,751 --> 00:18:18,925
Come on, man, Beebo?

374
00:18:18,927 --> 00:18:20,317
Is nothing sacred?

375
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,734
You know, it's a smart move.

376
00:18:21,737 --> 00:18:23,205
Distracting all the fuzz

377
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:26,411
with giant fuzz, but
someone should have told you.

378
00:18:26,413 --> 00:18:29,196
Beebo, he's off limits.

379
00:18:33,966 --> 00:18:36,359
Beebo!

380
00:18:36,362 --> 00:18:37,726
Oh!

381
00:18:38,729 --> 00:18:39,946
Got him again.

382
00:18:39,948 --> 00:18:41,991
Pee-ew.

383
00:18:43,517 --> 00:18:45,694
So how normal was that for everyone?

384
00:18:45,697 --> 00:18:46,947
And don't say very.

385
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:49,085
Oh, well, with this
new Earth, just may be.

386
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:51,525
Well, dear God, I hope not.

387
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:55,701
What is that?

388
00:18:55,703 --> 00:18:56,869
Alcohol.

389
00:19:00,142 --> 00:19:01,143
Mm.

390
00:19:02,405 --> 00:19:03,883
Rory, huh?

391
00:19:03,885 --> 00:19:06,538
We had a Rory once on our team.

392
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,322
We did.

393
00:19:09,586 --> 00:19:11,020
What's this?

394
00:19:11,022 --> 00:19:12,544
Was there a memo that went out

395
00:19:12,546 --> 00:19:14,197
on how to infiltrate our secret bunker?

396
00:19:14,199 --> 00:19:15,547
Why are you here?

397
00:19:15,549 --> 00:19:17,679
I'm here to warn you. You see this?

398
00:19:17,681 --> 00:19:19,899
This gauntlet is primed
to detect antimatter

399
00:19:19,901 --> 00:19:22,380
of which there has been a massive surge

400
00:19:22,383 --> 00:19:24,338
in the Star City area.

401
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,162
Okay, well, you're
about two hours too late.

402
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,602
Yeah, already took care of it.

403
00:19:27,604 --> 00:19:30,277
Did you really? My
readings say different.

404
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,802
This thing ain't over.

405
00:19:31,805 --> 00:19:35,000
As a matter of fact,
it's just beginning.

406
00:19:38,922 --> 00:19:40,791
Something's not right.

407
00:19:40,794 --> 00:19:42,838
- That thing still working?
- Yeah, it's working.

408
00:19:42,841 --> 00:19:44,406
I built it myself. It's infallible.

409
00:19:44,409 --> 00:19:47,280
Yeah, but you're still
detecting traces of antimatter.

410
00:19:47,282 --> 00:19:48,826
Then our fight isn't done, is it?

411
00:19:48,829 --> 00:19:50,283
No.

412
00:19:50,285 --> 00:19:53,503
Or worse, it's starting
up all over again.

413
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,513
Hey.

414
00:20:03,515 --> 00:20:04,891
How'd you find me?

415
00:20:06,254 --> 00:20:08,645
You feel that gust of
wind a few seconds ago?

416
00:20:08,648 --> 00:20:09,821
That was me.

417
00:20:09,824 --> 00:20:11,922
I did a quick search of
the whole city for you.

418
00:20:13,656 --> 00:20:16,091
When you didn't come back for
the post-Beebo celebration,

419
00:20:16,093 --> 00:20:17,312
I got a little worried.

420
00:20:18,352 --> 00:20:19,488
Yeah.

421
00:20:22,317 --> 00:20:24,099
See that tree over there?

422
00:20:24,101 --> 00:20:26,362
My sister and I, we
used to race to the top

423
00:20:26,364 --> 00:20:27,581
when we were little.

424
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:29,324
I'd win every time.

425
00:20:31,717 --> 00:20:33,935
I used to think it was
because I was a better climber,

426
00:20:33,937 --> 00:20:38,331
but now I think Laurel let me win

427
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,291
'cause she knew I was a sore loser.

428
00:20:43,338 --> 00:20:45,253
A lot has changed since then.

429
00:20:46,602 --> 00:20:49,472
I was an assassin.

430
00:20:49,474 --> 00:20:54,564
I was dead, now I'm the
captain of a friggin' time ship.

431
00:20:54,566 --> 00:20:58,829
One thing remains the same.
I'm still a sore loser.

432
00:21:01,834 --> 00:21:05,227
I know it's... it's hard

433
00:21:05,229 --> 00:21:08,535
not having Oliver here with us.

434
00:21:08,537 --> 00:21:11,061
But look at what his
sacrifice made possible.

435
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,239
Our world is... it's different...

436
00:21:17,241 --> 00:21:18,849
But at least it's safe.

437
00:21:21,941 --> 00:21:26,424
He was just the last tether
to my old life, you know?

438
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:31,558
And he was the only
person left who knew me

439
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:35,433
when I was just... me.

440
00:21:36,521 --> 00:21:39,847
With him gone, my
connection to this world,

441
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:43,549
this place, to that tree...

442
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,663
It's gone.

443
00:21:49,795 --> 00:21:52,668
I know what it's like to lose family.

444
00:21:54,757 --> 00:21:57,410
My mom, my dad,

445
00:21:57,412 --> 00:22:00,500
each death felt like

446
00:22:00,502 --> 00:22:04,634
there was no moving forward, like life

447
00:22:04,636 --> 00:22:06,596
- would never be the same.
- Yeah.

448
00:22:08,031 --> 00:22:10,031
And I was right it's not the same,

449
00:22:10,033 --> 00:22:14,385
but... somehow it's okay.

450
00:22:15,821 --> 00:22:17,821
Family isn't just the
people that you grew up with.

451
00:22:17,823 --> 00:22:21,307
It's the people you
find, the ones you love,

452
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,877
ones that make you crazy....

453
00:22:24,439 --> 00:22:25,570
Make you smile.

454
00:22:27,703 --> 00:22:29,574
When did you get so wise?

455
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,014
The Legends, they are my family.

456
00:22:37,016 --> 00:22:39,060
They have been for a while.

457
00:22:39,062 --> 00:22:43,281
I guess I just... I always
thought there would be

458
00:22:43,283 --> 00:22:46,598
at least someone who
remembered what I was like

459
00:22:46,601 --> 00:22:48,461
before I got on that boat.

460
00:23:05,305 --> 00:23:06,957
I thought we got rid
of all those things.

461
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:10,178
Barry, Sara, the shadow demons are back.

462
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,746
I believe we are being hunted.

463
00:23:12,748 --> 00:23:15,162
If they're hunting the
Paragons, that means...

464
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,490
Ryan.

465
00:23:32,071 --> 00:23:35,159
Sara? What the hell's going on?

466
00:23:35,161 --> 00:23:37,074
You have to come with me now.

467
00:23:38,774 --> 00:23:41,339
All right, Barry, J'onn,
Supergirl, and Batlady

468
00:23:41,341 --> 00:23:42,732
are gathering the troops.

469
00:23:42,735 --> 00:23:44,951
Those attacks were probably
just the first wave.

470
00:23:44,954 --> 00:23:47,389
Assassins sent to pick us off in pairs.

471
00:23:47,391 --> 00:23:49,609
How are the shadow
demons even still here?

472
00:23:49,611 --> 00:23:51,611
Didn't Oliver destroy
the guy who controls them?

473
00:23:51,613 --> 00:23:53,134
Well, not according to the surge

474
00:23:53,136 --> 00:23:55,136
in antimatter energy I'm reading.

475
00:23:55,138 --> 00:23:57,009
The Anti-Monitor is alive?

476
00:23:58,097 --> 00:24:00,663
But you said Oliver sacrificed himself

477
00:24:00,665 --> 00:24:02,364
to create this new world.

478
00:24:02,367 --> 00:24:05,357
Apparently, his sacrifice
didn't kill the Anti-Monitor.

479
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,104
Well, then how do we do that?

480
00:24:07,106 --> 00:24:09,542
Well, let's just throw him into the sun

481
00:24:09,544 --> 00:24:11,369
and let the bastard burn.

482
00:24:11,371 --> 00:24:12,893
Oh yeah, let's throw him in the sun

483
00:24:12,895 --> 00:24:14,938
and cause an antimatter explosion

484
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,418
that obliterates the solar system.

485
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:17,741
You know what, let's not do that.

486
00:24:17,743 --> 00:24:19,595
At least he's trying
to offer up a solution

487
00:24:19,597 --> 00:24:21,641
instead of being the
cause of the problem.

488
00:24:21,643 --> 00:24:23,686
That's the solution?
Blow up the solar system?

489
00:24:23,688 --> 00:24:27,560
Guys, guys, we're all
on the same team, okay?

490
00:24:27,562 --> 00:24:29,466
No, Scrappy's right.

491
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:31,041
It's my fault we're in this mess.

492
00:24:31,043 --> 00:24:33,000
We gotta fix it. Gotta fix it.

493
00:24:33,002 --> 00:24:34,958
It's just a little tricky.

494
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,352
The Anti-Monitor is made of antimatter,

495
00:24:37,354 --> 00:24:38,571
and, like its opposite,

496
00:24:38,573 --> 00:24:40,181
it can neither be created nor destroyed.

497
00:24:40,183 --> 00:24:41,617
It can only...

498
00:24:41,619 --> 00:24:43,271
Change form and move
from place to place.

499
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:45,403
So what if we do just that?

500
00:24:45,405 --> 00:24:47,580
What if we could set
off a chain reaction

501
00:24:47,582 --> 00:24:48,972
that will destabilize his form?

502
00:24:48,974 --> 00:24:51,431
Compressing his molecules
so he's essentially

503
00:24:51,434 --> 00:24:53,237
shrinking for eternity.

504
00:24:53,239 --> 00:24:54,939
Is that kind of reaction even possible?

505
00:24:54,942 --> 00:24:55,927
Sure it is.

506
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,503
I did it a bunch of times by accident

507
00:24:57,505 --> 00:24:59,287
when I was developing my ATOM exosuit.

508
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:01,190
So you think you can keep
him shrinking indefinitely?

509
00:25:01,192 --> 00:25:04,031
Essentially, we'd be sending
him to the "atomverse."

510
00:25:04,033 --> 00:25:05,989
I like to call it the Microverse.

511
00:25:05,991 --> 00:25:07,302
Ah, that's better.

512
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:09,036
Possible trademark
issues, but that's better.

513
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:11,647
He could get stuck
there for, like, ever.

514
00:25:11,649 --> 00:25:13,431
In theory it could totally work.

515
00:25:13,433 --> 00:25:15,608
But developing a device in time...

516
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:17,087
Leave that to me, D-League.

517
00:25:17,089 --> 00:25:19,483
I just gotta get to STAR Labs. Scrappy.

518
00:25:21,963 --> 00:25:23,789
Look, if this goes down
anything like it did

519
00:25:23,792 --> 00:25:27,837
on Earth-38, then things
are gonna get messy.

520
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:30,187
Geek team, get on it.

521
00:25:30,189 --> 00:25:32,538
Mick, go with 'em, keep 'em safe.

522
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:36,498
The rest of us, we'll need to
hold back this incoming army.

523
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,071
Hey, this can work, Sara.

524
00:25:44,073 --> 00:25:46,073
I know it can.

525
00:25:46,075 --> 00:25:49,206
That's what we thought
back at the Dawn of Time.

526
00:25:49,208 --> 00:25:51,818
Here we are back at square one.

527
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:54,342
This new Earth isn't square one.

528
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:57,345
It's what Oliver gave
up his life to create.

529
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:59,523
We have to protect it.

530
00:26:00,829 --> 00:26:02,159
If we're gonna go down...

531
00:26:04,267 --> 00:26:05,832
We go down fighting.

532
00:26:13,512 --> 00:26:14,713
All right, listen up.

533
00:26:14,716 --> 00:26:16,513
I got a ton of those
shadow things descending

534
00:26:16,515 --> 00:26:18,689
- on Gardner Pier.
- Copy, we're en route.

535
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:21,953
This is new.

536
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,651
New world, new look.

537
00:26:23,653 --> 00:26:25,130
Cut the chatter, they're here.

538
00:26:52,943 --> 00:26:54,943
What the hell?

539
00:26:54,945 --> 00:26:56,510
Was that it?

540
00:26:59,515 --> 00:27:02,080
It's not over yet.

541
00:27:08,741 --> 00:27:14,617
Paragons, the universal
safeguard meant to thwart me.

542
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,968
It is time to meet your end!

543
00:27:19,534 --> 00:27:21,925
We'll need a reinforced
core to contain the reaction.

544
00:27:21,928 --> 00:27:23,663
- Titanium?
- No, that's too heavy.

545
00:27:23,666 --> 00:27:25,729
What we need... what we need is...

546
00:27:28,155 --> 00:27:29,588
Depleted promethium.

547
00:27:30,393 --> 00:27:33,197
STAR Labs, I've got shadows
advancing on your position.

548
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,358
On it.

549
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,549
It's been a while,
Frosty. You look good.

550
00:27:36,552 --> 00:27:39,358
Thanks. I read your book, Rebecca.

551
00:27:39,361 --> 00:27:41,711
Which one? I'm very prolific.

552
00:27:44,995 --> 00:27:46,821
Whoa.

553
00:27:46,823 --> 00:27:48,475
Do you wanna take this guy, or should I?

554
00:27:48,477 --> 00:27:49,563
Ladies first.

555
00:27:49,565 --> 00:27:50,999
Age before beauty.

556
00:27:51,001 --> 00:27:52,566
Mm.

557
00:27:57,834 --> 00:27:59,268
Who the hell are you?

558
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:00,922
Guy who just saved your ass.

559
00:28:00,924 --> 00:28:02,489
We had that covered.

560
00:28:02,491 --> 00:28:03,490
Sure you did.

561
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:06,623
Company's coming. You ready?

562
00:28:06,625 --> 00:28:08,671
I stay ready.

563
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:13,587
I am destiny incarnate,

564
00:28:13,589 --> 00:28:17,591
inexorable and inescapable.

565
00:28:17,593 --> 00:28:19,593
You are nothing.

566
00:28:19,595 --> 00:28:23,831
Insects fated to be
crushed beneath my heel

567
00:28:23,834 --> 00:28:26,295
without a moment's thought.

568
00:28:26,297 --> 00:28:28,013
Fighting is useless.

569
00:28:28,995 --> 00:28:30,691
Surrender.

570
00:28:33,696 --> 00:28:36,612
Not today. Not ever.

571
00:28:37,787 --> 00:28:41,223
Oliver died so that we
could continue to fight.

572
00:28:41,225 --> 00:28:44,269
He sacrificed everything
for this new world,

573
00:28:44,271 --> 00:28:46,794
and we will not fail him.

574
00:28:46,796 --> 00:28:49,233
We will not fail this world.

575
00:28:50,451 --> 00:28:51,842
For Oliver.

576
00:28:51,844 --> 00:28:53,757
- For Oliver.
- For Oliver.

577
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:54,751
For Oliver!

578
00:28:54,754 --> 00:28:56,194
For Oliver!

579
00:29:53,863 --> 00:29:58,737
The age of heroes ends now!

580
00:30:00,739 --> 00:30:03,784
Guys, we're gonna need a bigger bomb.

581
00:30:03,786 --> 00:30:05,744
Sky team, with me.

582
00:30:22,152 --> 00:30:24,935
Ray, how's that shrink bomb coming?

583
00:30:24,937 --> 00:30:26,850
Well, we could really
use some fast hands.

584
00:30:26,852 --> 00:30:28,093
Could we ever.

585
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,097
Barry.

586
00:30:42,781 --> 00:30:44,696
Supergirl, look out!

587
00:30:46,393 --> 00:30:47,394
J'onn!

588
00:30:52,922 --> 00:30:54,726
Where are you from, Sparkles?

589
00:30:54,729 --> 00:30:57,140
Don't call me Sparkles.
I'm from Freeland.

590
00:30:57,143 --> 00:31:00,449
Martian came, got in my head,
told me y'all were caught up.

591
00:31:00,451 --> 00:31:02,843
It's been a weird day.

592
00:31:06,578 --> 00:31:08,047
That's an understatement.

593
00:31:10,548 --> 00:31:11,982
All right, what are we making?

594
00:31:11,984 --> 00:31:13,767
- All right, so plans, right?
- Yep.

595
00:31:13,769 --> 00:31:15,159
Now, this is what we have to build.

596
00:31:15,161 --> 00:31:16,944
Now, these pieces are all very volatile.

597
00:31:16,946 --> 00:31:18,772
Be...

598
00:31:18,774 --> 00:31:20,338
- How's this look?
- Okay, that's good.

599
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,949
- Whoa.
- Love when he does that.

600
00:31:21,951 --> 00:31:23,077
That's perfect, actually.

601
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,908
Okay, so now all we have to do
is get it into direct contact

602
00:31:25,911 --> 00:31:27,508
with the Anti-Monitor
once we've activated it.

603
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,956
Okay, and to activate it
I just press this button?

604
00:31:28,958 --> 00:31:30,392
- No don't touch that!
- Are you crazy?

605
00:31:30,394 --> 00:31:32,023
All right, okay, relax, relax.

606
00:31:32,026 --> 00:31:33,612
All right, Ray, you're coming with me.

607
00:31:33,614 --> 00:31:34,746
Oh, cool.

608
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:47,562
No!

609
00:31:47,569 --> 00:31:49,019
Shadows are on the move again.

610
00:31:49,021 --> 00:31:50,066
Pérez Landing.

611
00:31:52,765 --> 00:31:54,374
Yeah, we know. We're here.

612
00:32:09,389 --> 00:32:10,519
Barry.

613
00:32:10,521 --> 00:32:11,738
Bomb's ready.

614
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,261
Ray's running it to the sky team.

615
00:32:13,263 --> 00:32:14,828
We're running out of time here, Ray.

616
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:16,655
- Hurry!
- Hurrying.

617
00:32:45,425 --> 00:32:46,949
Hope I'm not too late.

618
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,907
- Ray?
- Hang on, Superman.

619
00:32:58,090 --> 00:32:59,135
Throw it like a girl.

620
00:33:01,572 --> 00:33:02,878
Always.

621
00:33:09,885 --> 00:33:14,365
How did you... no!

622
00:33:23,899 --> 00:33:25,812
We did it. We did it!

623
00:33:25,814 --> 00:33:27,335
Wait, but where's Kal?

624
00:33:27,337 --> 00:33:28,572
I'm right here.

625
00:33:28,575 --> 00:33:29,837
Whoa.

626
00:33:31,297 --> 00:33:33,778
Sorry about that, Superman. Here you go.

627
00:33:38,548 --> 00:33:40,452
Thank you, Ollie.

628
00:33:43,858 --> 00:33:45,480
My fellow Americans,

629
00:33:45,483 --> 00:33:50,466
today our way of life, our world,

630
00:33:50,469 --> 00:33:52,774
almost came to an end.

631
00:33:52,776 --> 00:33:56,604
An entity known as the Anti-Monitor

632
00:33:56,606 --> 00:34:01,086
attacked Earth intent
on its destruction.

633
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:03,480
Thankfully, we were saved

634
00:34:03,482 --> 00:34:06,614
by Earth's greatest heroes...

635
00:34:06,616 --> 00:34:09,039
- Hey, Sara.
- Hey, sweetie.

636
00:34:09,042 --> 00:34:10,235
Baby, come over here.

637
00:34:10,238 --> 00:34:12,110
Your brother wants to play with you.

638
00:34:12,113 --> 00:34:14,070
Their unity and strength

639
00:34:14,073 --> 00:34:16,696
should be an example for us all.

640
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:22,151
I'm told this assembly was
led by Star City's Oliver Queen

641
00:34:22,153 --> 00:34:25,459
otherwise known as the Green Arrow.

642
00:34:25,461 --> 00:34:29,255
We give thanks to these
brave women and men

643
00:34:29,258 --> 00:34:32,856
who, with great tenacity, tireless work,

644
00:34:32,859 --> 00:34:37,296
and the utmost courage,
put their lives on the line

645
00:34:37,298 --> 00:34:41,300
for our country, our planet.

646
00:34:43,651 --> 00:34:45,052
Hey, Lois.

647
00:34:45,055 --> 00:34:46,957
Clark, I need you to
get to Metropolis now.

648
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,048
It's the boys.

649
00:34:49,211 --> 00:34:50,466
The boys?

650
00:34:50,469 --> 00:34:52,560
Yeah, honey, your sons.

651
00:34:56,143 --> 00:34:58,857
While in a hard-fought battle,

652
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,929
loss is expected.

653
00:35:00,931 --> 00:35:03,061
It never gets any easier,

654
00:35:03,063 --> 00:35:06,500
so it is with great sadness

655
00:35:06,502 --> 00:35:10,199
that I must inform you that Oliver Queen

656
00:35:10,201 --> 00:35:14,682
sacrificed his life for
our world's survival.

657
00:35:14,684 --> 00:35:16,510
He is known to us

658
00:35:16,512 --> 00:35:19,556
as the first of our heroes,

659
00:35:19,558 --> 00:35:23,560
and while this is a devastating loss,

660
00:35:23,562 --> 00:35:25,997
we can take solace in knowing

661
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:28,652
that he lived as he died,

662
00:35:28,654 --> 00:35:31,002
with honor.

663
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:34,214
I ask all of you to join me

664
00:35:34,217 --> 00:35:37,095
in a moment of silence to honor him now.

665
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:57,986
A grateful nation thanks you, Mr. Queen.

666
00:35:57,988 --> 00:36:02,599
May you finally find
rest in the hereafter.

667
00:36:02,601 --> 00:36:04,601
God bless you,

668
00:36:04,603 --> 00:36:08,394
and God bless the
United States of America.

669
00:36:08,397 --> 00:36:09,702
Good night.

670
00:36:11,828 --> 00:36:15,046
In the end, there was only one,

671
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:16,789
a single black infinitude.

672
00:36:18,269 --> 00:36:20,487
Then the infinitude found release.

673
00:36:25,232 --> 00:36:28,843
And finally, the darkness broke,

674
00:36:28,845 --> 00:36:30,279
filling it with life....

675
00:36:33,549 --> 00:36:35,419
With the multiverse.

676
00:36:37,636 --> 00:36:39,069
_

677
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:42,293
Every existence
multiplied by possibility.

678
00:36:46,836 --> 00:36:51,779
And spread out before space
and time in infinite measure.

679
00:36:56,198 --> 00:36:57,479
_

680
00:36:57,482 --> 00:37:00,922
Civilizations rose and fell....

681
00:37:02,088 --> 00:37:03,659
_

682
00:37:03,662 --> 00:37:07,026
And rose again across
reality's grasping expanse.

683
00:37:09,784 --> 00:37:10,971
_

684
00:37:10,974 --> 00:37:14,456
Life, a precious gift, persevering

685
00:37:14,459 --> 00:37:16,823
in the face of every obstacle...

686
00:37:18,065 --> 00:37:19,909
_

687
00:37:26,532 --> 00:37:29,751
Until, finally,

688
00:37:29,754 --> 00:37:32,237
- _
- the age of heroes was born.

689
00:37:39,381 --> 00:37:42,382
Thanks for saving us, Oliver.

690
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:44,082
The world has hope again.

691
00:37:45,744 --> 00:37:48,005
I have hope again.

692
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:49,628
We'll never forget you.

693
00:37:59,022 --> 00:38:01,799
Thanks for believing in
me even when I didn't.

694
00:38:03,705 --> 00:38:08,100
You had this way of bringing
out the very best in all of us.

695
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,775
I'm gonna miss you, man.

696
00:38:23,573 --> 00:38:25,570
I've lost a lot of people that I love.

697
00:38:26,977 --> 00:38:30,544
But I never imagined my
life without you in it.

698
00:38:30,547 --> 00:38:32,765
You were always there for me.

699
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:34,247
And now...

700
00:38:38,338 --> 00:38:42,284
Ollie, you changed my
fate for the better.

701
00:38:44,253 --> 00:38:45,556
Thank you.

702
00:39:14,563 --> 00:39:19,596
I never met Oliver, but he
must have been a good dude.

703
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:31,401
But why'd you choose
a condemned building?

704
00:39:31,404 --> 00:39:32,751
What?

705
00:39:32,754 --> 00:39:35,065
No, this is not a condemned building.

706
00:39:35,068 --> 00:39:38,678
No, listen, this is an old
STAR Labs Research Facility

707
00:39:38,681 --> 00:39:40,638
that nobody uses, and
what's even better,

708
00:39:40,641 --> 00:39:42,684
no one knows it exists.

709
00:39:42,687 --> 00:39:44,168
- Good for you.
- No, good for us.

710
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:46,257
I figure we could all use this to gather

711
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:49,112
if anything ever happens again.

712
00:39:49,115 --> 00:39:50,414
It's a great idea, Barry.

713
00:39:50,417 --> 00:39:51,370
Thanks, Superman.

714
00:39:51,373 --> 00:39:54,237
It's a better option than
you all dropping by the DEO.

715
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,627
Why do we even need it?

716
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:57,108
I mean, how often does the world

717
00:39:57,111 --> 00:39:59,143
almost come to an end?

718
00:40:02,788 --> 00:40:04,571
Oh, it's like that.

719
00:40:04,574 --> 00:40:06,690
Don't worry, I was
the new kid last year.

720
00:40:06,693 --> 00:40:08,300
All right, listen, I
haven't even shown you guys

721
00:40:08,302 --> 00:40:10,307
the best part yet. You ready?

722
00:40:16,535 --> 00:40:18,921
Oh, nice.

723
00:40:32,001 --> 00:40:33,609
You should have led with that, bro.

724
00:40:33,611 --> 00:40:34,828
Yeah.

725
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:36,483
- Not bad.
- I love it.

726
00:40:40,806 --> 00:40:42,242
It's perfect.

727
00:41:18,898 --> 00:41:21,874
Sounds like we need
to call pest control.

728
00:41:21,877 --> 00:41:23,356
What was that?

729
00:41:31,466 --> 00:41:35,492
_

730
