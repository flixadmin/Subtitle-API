1
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:48,648
<font color=#5feaff><i>You think you know the truth about him?</i></font>

2
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:50,976
<font color=#5feaff><i>You know nothing.</i></font>

3
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:57,420
<font color=#5feaff><i>His father was Zeus.</i></font>

4
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,134
<font color=#5feaff><i>The Zeus.</i></font>

5
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:00,986
<font color=#5feaff><i>King of the gods.</i></font>

6
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:05,720
<font color=#5feaff><i>His mother,</i></font>

7
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,632
<font color=#5feaff><i>Alcmene, a mortal woman.</i></font>

8
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,198
<font color=#5feaff><i>Together they had a boy.</i></font>

9
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,161
<font color=#5feaff><i>Half human,</i></font>

10
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,280
<font color=#5feaff><i>half god.</i></font>

11
00:01:19,998 --> 00:01:21,902
<font color=#5feaff><i>But Zeus' queen, Hera,</i></font>

12
00:01:21,927 --> 00:01:24,589
<font color=#5feaff><i>saw this bastard child as an insult,</i></font>

13
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,488
<font color=#5feaff><i>a living reminder of
her husband's infidelity.</i></font>

14
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,383
<font color=#5feaff><i>Alcmene named the boy Hercules,</i></font>

15
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,639
<font color=#5feaff><i>which means, glory of Hera,</i></font>

16
00:01:33,908 --> 00:01:36,426
<font color=#5feaff><i>but this failed to appease the goddess.</i></font>

17
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,733
<font color=#5feaff><i>She wanted him dead.</i></font>

18
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:01,484
<font color=#5feaff><i>Luckily, he took after his father.</i></font>

19
00:02:03,844 --> 00:02:05,517
<font color=#5feaff><i>Once he reached manhood,</i></font>

20
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:08,546
<font color=#5feaff><i>the gods commanded him
to perform Twelve Labors,</i></font>

21
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:10,648
<font color=#5feaff><i>twelve dangerous missions.</i></font>

22
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:13,343
<font color=#5feaff><i>If he completed them all and survived,</i></font>

23
00:02:13,787 --> 00:02:16,898
<font color=#5feaff><i>Hera agreed to finally
let him live in peace.</i></font>

24
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:37,847
<font color=#5feaff><i>He fought the Lernean Hydra!</i></font>

25
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,997
<font color=#5feaff><i>He battled the Erymanthean Boar!</i></font>

26
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,010
<font color=#5feaff><i>But his greatest Labor,</i></font>

27
00:03:09,331 --> 00:03:10,995
<font color=#5feaff><i>was the Nemean Lion.</i></font>

28
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:18,536
<font color=#5feaff><i>This was no ordinary beast.</i></font>

29
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:23,191
<font color=#5feaff><i>It had a hide so tough,</i></font>

30
00:03:23,215 --> 00:03:25,005
<font color=#5feaff><i>no weapon could penetrate it.</i></font>

31
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,558
<font color=#5feaff><i>But even this monster was no match
for the son of Zeus.</i></font>

32
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,188
What a load of crap!

33
00:03:47,323 --> 00:03:48,825
Every word is true.

34
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,609
You know what I think?

35
00:03:54,143 --> 00:03:56,698
This friend of yours doesn't even exist.

36
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,112
Laugh all you want.

37
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,270
He is coming.

38
00:04:00,294 --> 00:04:02,997
And be warned Gryza,
he despises pirates.

39
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:05,887
Macedonia has been good to us.

40
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:08,893
Plenty of villages ripe for pillaging.

41
00:04:09,098 --> 00:04:10,760
We are here to stay.

42
00:04:10,905 --> 00:04:12,077
Finish him.

43
00:04:14,934 --> 00:04:17,528
The more you struggle,
the faster you drop.

44
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,848
Indeed, your fleet is strong. I...

45
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:25,962
Yet,

46
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:30,078
as I was about to explain
before I was so rudely interrupted,

47
00:04:30,369 --> 00:04:32,337
the Nemean Lion was strong too.

48
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,616
Yet he still destroyed it.

49
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,183
And not with a sword
or a spear or arrows.

50
00:04:38,207 --> 00:04:39,012
No!

51
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,831
I did it with my bare hands!

52
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:49,460
Or so they say.

53
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,214
Hercules.

54
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,924
Is this all the men you have?

55
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:58,966
There is 40 of us. One of you.

56
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:02,725
The king of this land
has offered me gold to dispose of you.

57
00:05:03,405 --> 00:05:04,584
So leave...

58
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:05,938
or die.

59
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:07,770
I get paid either way.

60
00:05:08,667 --> 00:05:11,286
Make him bleed.

61
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:19,721
Five men with a single blow.

62
00:05:20,213 --> 00:05:22,580
Still think you can destroy
the son of Zeus?

63
00:05:23,101 --> 00:05:25,103
Bring me his head!

64
00:05:27,882 --> 00:05:30,055
Seems they need
more convincing, Autolycus.

65
00:05:30,359 --> 00:05:31,702
That's why we are here.

66
00:05:33,804 --> 00:05:35,010
Atalanta.

67
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:39,617
Amphiaraus.

68
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,234
May Zeus forgive you.

69
00:05:44,281 --> 00:05:45,374
Tydeus?

70
00:06:08,912 --> 00:06:10,381
Die, Hercules!

71
00:06:15,995 --> 00:06:16,996
Good man.

72
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,248
Hurry!

73
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,638
Hurry! Uncle!

74
00:06:33,372 --> 00:06:34,357
Uncle, hurry!

75
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,321
Hurry! Hurry!

76
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,589
Any longer, Uncle...

77
00:06:41,614 --> 00:06:44,493
And the girls would finally be safe
from your attentions.

78
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,497
The rest of you may go.

79
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,997
But not you.

80
00:07:05,552 --> 00:07:06,617
Thirteen,

81
00:07:08,203 --> 00:07:09,210
Fiveteen.

82
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:10,375
Sixteen.

83
00:07:11,015 --> 00:07:11,833
Seventeen.

84
00:07:11,858 --> 00:07:13,467
That was fun.
Eighteen.

85
00:07:13,492 --> 00:07:14,764
Nineteen. Twenty.

86
00:07:15,398 --> 00:07:16,535
Twenty pirates,

87
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:18,288
at two gold pieces a head,

88
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:20,648
minus the headless ones. Let's see.

89
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:21,875
Not a bad night.

90
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,514
You see how the pirates ran?

91
00:07:23,905 --> 00:07:25,733
My story softened their resolve.

92
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,048
Their resolve must be broken, Iolaus.

93
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:30,007
When you spread
the legend of Hercules,

94
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:32,226
make it bigger, scarier.

95
00:07:32,335 --> 00:07:35,194
The more they believe
Hercules is truly the son of Zeus,

96
00:07:35,327 --> 00:07:36,895
the less likely they are to fight.

97
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,389
Amphiaraus?

98
00:07:44,911 --> 00:07:46,526
Care to join us here on Earth?

99
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,337
A lion and a crow in strange alliance,

100
00:07:54,361 --> 00:07:56,339
fighting across a sea of corpses.

101
00:08:03,094 --> 00:08:06,094
If you are going to use those herbs,
Amphiaraus, at least share.

102
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,650
Hold it! Hold it!

103
00:08:15,674 --> 00:08:17,955
Hold it! Hold it!

104
00:08:18,151 --> 00:08:19,875
Fight it!

105
00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:22,760
Keep practicing, boys!

106
00:08:23,192 --> 00:08:25,471
So who is next?
You? You?

107
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:30,785
That's a pretty sight.

108
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,099
One more payday Autolycus,
that's all we need.

109
00:08:33,195 --> 00:08:36,074
Then we get to live like
the kings we have served.

110
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,046
Or live...

111
00:08:37,522 --> 00:08:38,370
simply.

112
00:08:40,618 --> 00:08:42,712
You still dreaming of barbarian lands?

113
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,178
Beyond the Aegean.

114
00:08:44,479 --> 00:08:46,135
At the shores of the Black Sea.

115
00:08:46,319 --> 00:08:49,323
That is where I will live out
the rest of my days in solitude.

116
00:08:49,758 --> 00:08:51,258
Boring, if you ask me.

117
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:52,945
Maybe so Autolycus.

118
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,564
But I will never find peace,

119
00:08:54,588 --> 00:08:57,016
unless I move as far away as possible.

120
00:08:57,921 --> 00:08:59,187
What of Tydeus?

121
00:08:59,499 --> 00:09:02,378
Without you to temper his rage,
I fear what he may become.

122
00:09:02,638 --> 00:09:04,021
Tydeus will go with me.

123
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:07,272
Civilization has become
too civilized for us.

124
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,239
Uncle!

125
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,127
Join us.
The girls are eager to welcome you.

126
00:09:21,404 --> 00:09:22,175
See?

127
00:09:22,199 --> 00:09:23,938
I told you I knew Hercules.

128
00:09:25,718 --> 00:09:26,930
Are you his servant?

129
00:09:27,157 --> 00:09:28,305
I am his nephew.

130
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:29,490
Are you really?

131
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,370
I tell of Hercules' Twelve Labors,

132
00:09:31,534 --> 00:09:32,812
like the Nemean Lion,

133
00:09:32,836 --> 00:09:34,090
the Apples of the Hesperides,

134
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,447
the Belt of Hippolyta

135
00:09:35,472 --> 00:09:38,402
with its buxom naked Amazons
and exciting bondage.

136
00:09:38,558 --> 00:09:40,276
I immortalize him...
He talks,

137
00:09:40,459 --> 00:09:42,006
while the rest of us fight.

138
00:09:42,238 --> 00:09:45,194
It is a wonder
you share the same blood as Hercules.

139
00:09:46,632 --> 00:09:47,679
Have fun.

140
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,201
Ladies.

141
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,628
What do you want with Hercules?

142
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:13,326
My words are for him, not you.

143
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,291
Atalanta, it's alright.

144
00:10:22,241 --> 00:10:24,369
You certainly are a hard man to find.

145
00:10:24,676 --> 00:10:26,380
Maybe I don't want anyone to find me.

146
00:10:26,761 --> 00:10:28,269
I am not just anyone.

147
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:29,575
My name is Ergenia,

148
00:10:29,599 --> 00:10:31,047
daughter to Lord Cotys.

149
00:10:31,784 --> 00:10:34,583
Your father is most fortunate
to have such a beautiful heir.

150
00:10:36,623 --> 00:10:38,021
My father is most unfortunate.

151
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,061
He battles a warlord, Rhesus.

152
00:10:41,826 --> 00:10:43,481
Our land is torn by civil war.

153
00:10:43,506 --> 00:10:44,966
Every day, villages are destroyed,

154
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,706
crops ruined, innocents slaughtered.

155
00:10:47,187 --> 00:10:48,655
We all have problems.

156
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,013
Well, perhaps...

157
00:10:51,591 --> 00:10:54,557
I can convince you
to make our problems your own.

158
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,098
Unfortunately, My Lady,

159
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,532
Hercules is fully committed
till the Feast of Dionysus.

160
00:11:00,258 --> 00:11:02,692
We could however, advance you
to the front of the line,

161
00:11:02,716 --> 00:11:03,969
for the right price.

162
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:07,392
I thought heroes fight for glory.

163
00:11:07,518 --> 00:11:09,395
But mercenaries fight for gold.

164
00:11:09,598 --> 00:11:11,271
Lord Cotys is a rich man.

165
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:12,513
I like him already.

166
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:16,267
If you agree to aid him,
he will pay your weight in gold.

167
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:21,516
Eat up.

168
00:11:27,501 --> 00:11:29,799
A lion and crow in strange alliance.

169
00:11:30,534 --> 00:11:31,545
Told you.

170
00:11:37,537 --> 00:11:38,754
Where are we going?

171
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:42,942
It is good to see you safe, My Lady.

172
00:12:46,628 --> 00:12:50,747
This war claims more victims every day.
We were concerned, My Lady.

173
00:12:50,772 --> 00:12:53,671
Thank you, General Sitacles.
I was well protected.

174
00:12:55,444 --> 00:12:56,913
The mighty Hercules.

175
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,642
An honor.

176
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,657
Though not quite as big an honor
as I expected.

177
00:13:03,692 --> 00:13:04,521
General,

178
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,478
go tell my father
Hercules is here.

179
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,320
Uncle?

180
00:13:11,445 --> 00:13:12,321
Hera.

181
00:13:12,633 --> 00:13:13,579
Impressive.

182
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,478
It's meant to be.

183
00:13:15,648 --> 00:13:19,027
It took five years and a thousand men
to build her temple.

184
00:13:19,273 --> 00:13:21,326
Hera is the patron goddess of Thrace.

185
00:13:21,795 --> 00:13:23,040
Everyone knows the legend,

186
00:13:23,064 --> 00:13:25,678
how Hera seeks to destroy Hercules.

187
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:29,467
Perhaps the right cause
might finally reconcile you.

188
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:30,545
Mother!

189
00:13:31,198 --> 00:13:32,186
Arius.

190
00:13:35,991 --> 00:13:37,304
You are Hercules.

191
00:13:37,764 --> 00:13:38,581
That's right.

192
00:13:38,606 --> 00:13:41,061
My name is Arius.
I know all your Labors by heart.

193
00:13:41,295 --> 00:13:44,004
You killed the giant Geryon
with a single blow,

194
00:13:44,204 --> 00:13:46,002
cleaned the Augean stables
in one night.

195
00:13:46,027 --> 00:13:46,926
Hercules is probably tired.

196
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,746
And the Labor of the Hide,
and the Labor of the Mares.

197
00:13:48,771 --> 00:13:50,137
That's enough Arius. Come along.

198
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,297
Stay away from him.

199
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:54,876
Men who deal in violence
attract violence.

200
00:13:55,511 --> 00:13:58,595
But he is Hercules. He is no mere mortal.
He is the greatest!

201
00:14:01,544 --> 00:14:03,243
Lord Cotys will see you now.

202
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,652
Have you ever met royalty, Hercules?

203
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:14,788
Once or twice.

204
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:33,524
Father!

205
00:14:39,354 --> 00:14:40,480
Megara.

206
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,926
Welcome home, my love.

207
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:52,934
Hercules!

208
00:14:56,771 --> 00:15:00,606
Whenever I am here, I imagine
this is what Elysium must look like.

209
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,015
Well, men like us have the means,

210
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:05,278
to create our own paradise on Earth.

211
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:06,827
Look.

212
00:15:07,599 --> 00:15:09,021
Magnificent, are not they?

213
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,608
Well, do not keep us in suspense.
Are we...

214
00:15:13,115 --> 00:15:14,791
safe from the monster Hydra?

215
00:15:17,556 --> 00:15:19,736
The Hydra's heads, Your Majesty.

216
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,061
The masks of serpents.

217
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,913
No wonder men thought
they were monsters.

218
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:35,514
You have done your sovereign
a great service.

219
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,506
Come.

220
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:38,772
Let the people have their hero.

221
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,553
All hail,

222
00:15:40,944 --> 00:15:42,421
King Eurystheus.

223
00:15:43,585 --> 00:15:46,259
And the mighty protector of Athens,

224
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,535
Hercules!

225
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:53,119
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

226
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:57,223
A man faced with such adoration
might be tempted to think himself a god.

227
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,731
I only want to be
a husband and a father.

228
00:16:09,929 --> 00:16:11,351
Lord Cotys awaits.

229
00:16:30,849 --> 00:16:32,477
Hercules.

230
00:16:34,383 --> 00:16:35,594
Welcome.

231
00:16:36,941 --> 00:16:39,625
An honor to host such a legend.

232
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,122
Lord Cotys.

233
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,584
But in legend, you fight alone.

234
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:49,263
My reputation would not exist
without my comrades.

235
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:52,790
Autolycus of Sparta.

236
00:16:54,896 --> 00:16:56,569
Tydeus of Thebes.

237
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:00,702
Atalanta of Scythia.

238
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:03,139
Iolaus of Athens.

239
00:17:04,303 --> 00:17:06,488
And Amphiaraus of Argos.

240
00:17:06,513 --> 00:17:07,765
Amphiaraus?

241
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,114
The famed seer of Argos.

242
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,348
It is said you have glimpsed
your own death,

243
00:17:15,715 --> 00:17:19,293
so you fight each battle knowing that
it is not yet your time to die.

244
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:21,962
What else can you tell of the future?

245
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,099
Only what the gods see fit to reveal.

246
00:17:25,158 --> 00:17:26,159
A shame.

247
00:17:26,603 --> 00:17:29,482
It would have been a great gift
to know the outcome of this war.

248
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:32,936
The gods can be frustrating sometimes,
Lord Cotys.

249
00:17:39,884 --> 00:17:41,131
With respect,

250
00:17:41,522 --> 00:17:44,941
I fear that the task ahead
might not be suitable for a woman,

251
00:17:45,407 --> 00:17:47,980
even if she is an Amazon warrior.

252
00:17:54,497 --> 00:17:56,229
I stand corrected.

253
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,634
When the kings of yesteryear
built this citadel,

254
00:18:02,659 --> 00:18:05,495
it was intended as
the high seat of all Thrace.

255
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:06,949
But now,

256
00:18:06,973 --> 00:18:08,805
Thrace is divided.

257
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,870
This war has depleted our forces.

258
00:18:10,895 --> 00:18:14,394
We are left with nothing but farmers
and merchants to replenish our army.

259
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:17,011
It takes every one of us
to resist Rhesus.

260
00:18:17,374 --> 00:18:20,469
People think that he cannot be killed
by an ordinary mortal.

261
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,589
Only by a god.

262
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,167
Rhesus is a sorcerer.

263
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:28,893
His magic words confuse men,
bend them to his will.

264
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,723
He leads an army of monsters,

265
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,589
half horse, half human.

266
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:35,800
Centaurs?

267
00:18:36,441 --> 00:18:39,175
You have actually seen them?
They have been seen.

268
00:18:42,171 --> 00:18:43,639
Come, Hercules.

269
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:47,214
Let me show you what misery
Rhesus has brought us.

270
00:18:51,184 --> 00:18:55,109
Every week, more refugees arrive
seeking my protection,

271
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,499
most of them covered in blood,

272
00:18:57,523 --> 00:19:00,022
crippled or burnt by Rhesus' men.

273
00:19:00,241 --> 00:19:02,379
I feared nothing could ever
be good again,

274
00:19:02,817 --> 00:19:04,136
till you arrived.

275
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,457
I am just a mercenary fighting for gold.

276
00:19:08,996 --> 00:19:12,368
How we view ourselves
is of little consequence.

277
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:15,012
How others perceive us is important.

278
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:16,560
And your name,

279
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,119
like it or not,

280
00:19:18,363 --> 00:19:20,004
is a rallying cry.

281
00:19:26,764 --> 00:19:30,268
I have seen too much reality
to trust in legends, and I am not alone.

282
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:33,548
Nobody has any faith anymore.

283
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:38,608
The people need a hero.
They need someone to look up to.

284
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,210
My son...

285
00:19:41,452 --> 00:19:43,147
believes in you.

286
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,816
Bring us peace and...

287
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,441
I will believe in you too.

288
00:19:58,627 --> 00:20:00,441
I am convinced these are good people.

289
00:20:00,598 --> 00:20:02,439
I see. And who is more convincing,

290
00:20:02,463 --> 00:20:03,973
Cotys or his daughter?

291
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:07,318
All the gold on Earth is not
as convincing as a pair of breasts.

292
00:20:07,343 --> 00:20:09,393
Maybe but gold never ages.

293
00:20:09,885 --> 00:20:11,690
Which is why
I got them to double our price.

294
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,714
Double your weight in gold?

295
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:15,280
Well done.

296
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,386
Amphiaraus?

297
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,887
If it be the will of Zeus.

298
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,345
Which title sounds more terrifying
to our enemies?

299
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:22,126
Hercules, savior of Thrace,

300
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:24,093
or Hercules, a Legend is Born?

301
00:20:24,168 --> 00:20:26,164
Both sound terrifyingly boring.

302
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,684
What are we supposed to do
with an army of farmers?

303
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:34,166
Train them.

304
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,738
Oh, shit.

305
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:46,166
In war, there is one thing
more important than killing.

306
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,380
Surviving.

307
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,988
My companions and I...

308
00:20:51,012 --> 00:20:52,905
will show you how to stay alive,

309
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:56,741
so that you may return home
to your farms someday.

310
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:01,226
Autolycus.

311
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:03,684
Shield wall! Form!

312
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,242
Corpses! Every last one of you!

313
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:27,086
Because your shield wall was weak.

314
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:28,583
Dead.

315
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:30,377
Dead.

316
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,212
Very dead.

317
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,302
Soldier,

318
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,588
many lives depend on you.

319
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,411
When attacked,

320
00:21:39,693 --> 00:21:41,016
lock your feet in the ground.

321
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:44,808
You understand?

322
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,229
Yes sir.

323
00:21:47,303 --> 00:21:48,930
When a shield wall is strong,

324
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,431
nothing can ever defeat it!

325
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:54,218
You must learn to work together,

326
00:21:54,499 --> 00:21:55,751
react together.

327
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:57,304
When you do,

328
00:21:57,532 --> 00:22:00,002
each individual
will become a link in a chain

329
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:02,371
that will be stronger than iron.

330
00:22:07,229 --> 00:22:09,072
I hope the enemy has a sense of humor.

331
00:22:10,636 --> 00:22:11,360
Right.

332
00:22:11,384 --> 00:22:12,527
Today's lesson,

333
00:22:12,551 --> 00:22:14,266
how not to stab yourselves!

334
00:22:15,852 --> 00:22:18,408
It is imperative that we strike now,

335
00:22:18,658 --> 00:22:20,416
My Lord, given this opportunity.

336
00:22:21,362 --> 00:22:22,494
There you are!

337
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:23,997
Hercules,

338
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:25,916
my scouts have brought news.

339
00:22:25,998 --> 00:22:27,406
Rhesus is on the move.

340
00:22:27,431 --> 00:22:29,535
Archers who shoot lightning
from their bows.

341
00:22:29,707 --> 00:22:32,902
And infantry 4,000 strong,
their minds bewitched.

342
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,714
Demons march with them.

343
00:22:34,739 --> 00:22:36,366
So now we are fighting demons.

344
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:40,141
No stranger than the monsters
I hear you faced, Hercules.

345
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:41,390
My Lord,

346
00:22:41,414 --> 00:22:43,558
Rhesus is preparing
to attack Bessi lands.

347
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:45,774
He will be on them within six days.

348
00:22:45,898 --> 00:22:48,063
If the Bessi fall, we are next.

349
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:49,606
Unless we intercept him.

350
00:22:49,631 --> 00:22:52,805
Your men need weeks, if not months,
of training before they are ready.

351
00:22:52,961 --> 00:22:56,460
The Bessi are a fierce
but primitive tribe.

352
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,657
If we do not protect them,
then...

353
00:22:58,681 --> 00:23:00,243
there will be a bloodbath.

354
00:23:00,268 --> 00:23:01,946
Face Rhesus with an untrained army

355
00:23:01,971 --> 00:23:03,757
and you risk losing
far more than a single battle.

356
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,956
My Lord, Rhesus is coming.

357
00:23:06,495 --> 00:23:08,012
I vouch my life on it.

358
00:23:09,153 --> 00:23:11,004
The longer Rhesus lives,

359
00:23:11,535 --> 00:23:13,672
the more villages will be burnt,

360
00:23:13,696 --> 00:23:15,582
and the more innocents will be killed.

361
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:18,010
Assemble your men.

362
00:23:18,283 --> 00:23:19,744
We march tomorrow.

363
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,265
Hercules,

364
00:23:23,484 --> 00:23:25,462
the gods have offered us a gift.

365
00:23:26,377 --> 00:23:28,129
We must not squander it.

366
00:23:28,675 --> 00:23:30,617
Are your gods going
to be fighting with us?

367
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,411
No.

368
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,906
The son of Zeus will.

369
00:23:50,152 --> 00:23:52,706
I have seen how you watch over Hercules.

370
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:56,612
Tell me,

371
00:23:57,902 --> 00:23:59,242
how did a woman,

372
00:24:00,712 --> 00:24:02,101
beautiful woman,

373
00:24:03,476 --> 00:24:06,117
fall in with these hardened men...

374
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:07,476
killers?

375
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:15,286
Son of Zeus need
a woman is protection?

376
00:24:15,516 --> 00:24:17,028
I don't protect him.

377
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,855
I protect you from him.

378
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:47,748
General, from now on, maybe you
should favor the company of your men.

379
00:24:56,315 --> 00:24:57,204
He pulled a knife?

380
00:24:57,834 --> 00:24:59,597
It was only a small prick.

381
00:25:41,024 --> 00:25:43,246
Your mother told you to stay away.
You should listen.

382
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:45,378
What's wrong with him?

383
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:51,301
Tydeus is my most loyal warrior.

384
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:54,265
He was born in war.

385
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:55,876
When I found him,

386
00:25:56,563 --> 00:25:58,350
he was more animal than human.

387
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:04,249
He never speaks of what he saw.

388
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:06,990
He never speaks at all.

389
00:26:08,426 --> 00:26:10,326
But he relives it every night.

390
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:13,537
Come.

391
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:15,031
Let's find your mother.

392
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:25,209
When I grow up,
I want to be a great hero, like you.

393
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,156
Like me?

394
00:26:26,237 --> 00:26:28,228
No hero is greater than Hercules.

395
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,616
I know all your Labors.

396
00:26:29,678 --> 00:26:30,827
Like the Cretan Bull,

397
00:26:30,851 --> 00:26:33,295
you wrestled it
for seven days and seven nights.

398
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,606
That's a bit exaggerated.

399
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:37,000
And struck it 49 times with your club.

400
00:26:37,273 --> 00:26:38,684
Maybe not quite that many.

401
00:26:38,709 --> 00:26:40,420
Until it fell dead and Crete was saved.

402
00:26:40,623 --> 00:26:42,128
It's my favorite Labor.

403
00:26:42,784 --> 00:26:44,411
Also Queen Hippolyta's Belt,

404
00:26:44,566 --> 00:26:47,313
with its buxom Amazons
and exciting bondage.

405
00:26:48,917 --> 00:26:50,347
Do you even know what that means?

406
00:26:50,628 --> 00:26:51,540
No.

407
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:02,317
Mother.

408
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:03,498
Arius.

409
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:05,256
You are supposed to be in bed.

410
00:27:08,394 --> 00:27:09,753
Why are you in the hospice?

411
00:27:09,901 --> 00:27:11,778
My mother saves people's lives.

412
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,142
Many of our physicians
were killed during battle.

413
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:18,299
So, out of necessity,
I taught myself the art of healing.

414
00:27:20,393 --> 00:27:21,465
If I could be like you,

415
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:24,185
I would protect all of Thrace
and no one would ever get hurt.

416
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:35,162
Here.

417
00:27:37,147 --> 00:27:39,104
I was going to give this
to someone else,

418
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:42,526
but I never got the chance.

419
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,547
Only a hero may wear this.

420
00:27:47,306 --> 00:27:49,900
But to become a hero,
you must grow strong.

421
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:55,095
Is this the Nemean Lion's tooth?

422
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:57,279
It is.
Thank you.

423
00:27:58,858 --> 00:27:59,859
Thank you.

424
00:28:00,306 --> 00:28:01,307
Good night.

425
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:02,927
Good night, Hercules.

426
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,185
Have no fear.

427
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,804
If you fall in the service of a just cause,

428
00:28:13,029 --> 00:28:15,202
your souls will go to Elysium,

429
00:28:15,482 --> 00:28:19,490
where they will dwell forever
among the shades of heroes,

430
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,041
like Theseus.

431
00:28:21,209 --> 00:28:22,301
Odysseus!

432
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:24,328
And the great Achilles.

433
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,401
Or if you are lucky, you will go to Hades,

434
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,406
where all the fun people are.

435
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:37,492
Iolaus.

436
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:40,477
Your place is beside Lord Cotys,
where it's safe.

437
00:28:40,568 --> 00:28:41,938
I have been giving it a lot of thought,

438
00:28:42,066 --> 00:28:43,572
and I really feel I am ready to fight.

439
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:45,157
You are a storyteller, not a warrior.

440
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:46,254
We share the same blood.

441
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:47,589
And I will not see it shed.

442
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,929
Chariot.

443
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:50,587
Now.

444
00:28:58,362 --> 00:28:59,563
Thracians,

445
00:29:00,353 --> 00:29:01,978
the shield wall is your home.

446
00:29:02,467 --> 00:29:03,653
Your shelter.

447
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:04,939
When you sleep,

448
00:29:05,576 --> 00:29:06,871
the wall is your blanket.

449
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:08,693
When you fight,

450
00:29:09,185 --> 00:29:10,645
the wall is your armor.

451
00:29:11,648 --> 00:29:13,901
The shield wall will
never break formation

452
00:29:13,926 --> 00:29:15,965
as long as there is breath in your body.

453
00:29:17,311 --> 00:29:18,918
Remember these words,

454
00:29:20,596 --> 00:29:22,033
and you will taste victory.

455
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:26,415
Move the army out!
Move out!

456
00:30:34,147 --> 00:30:34,975
Halt!

457
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:36,543
Halt!

458
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:37,793
Halt!

459
00:30:38,005 --> 00:30:39,045
Halt!

460
00:31:10,529 --> 00:31:12,014
We are too late.

461
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,803
Rhesus has already been here.

462
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:20,033
Leave the chariots.

463
00:31:20,275 --> 00:31:21,691
We will go down on foot.

464
00:31:50,726 --> 00:31:53,574
The lion and crow
cross a field of corpses.

465
00:31:55,095 --> 00:31:57,348
I hate being right all the time.

466
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:04,009
Halt.

467
00:32:04,094 --> 00:32:04,739
Halt!

468
00:32:05,142 --> 00:32:05,970
Halt!

469
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,065
This head is rotting.

470
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:21,740
A week old, at least.

471
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:26,768
Yet some of these bodies are fresh.

472
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:43,719
Uncle!

473
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:55,413
And we have walked into a trap.

474
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:06,563
Shield wall! Form a single square!
Protect Lord Cotys! Iolaus, go!

475
00:33:06,687 --> 00:33:07,907
Shield wall!

476
00:33:17,874 --> 00:33:20,374
We are here to help them.
Why are they attacking?

477
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,968
This is Rhesus' doing.

478
00:33:22,315 --> 00:33:24,768
They say his spells have
the power to cloud minds.

479
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,151
Turn comrades against each other.

480
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:37,516
King's guards, around Lord Cotys!

481
00:33:46,925 --> 00:33:49,098
Amphiaraus, do we die in this battle?

482
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:51,225
My time is not come yet.

483
00:33:52,033 --> 00:33:53,385
Not sure about yours.

484
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:56,432
That's comforting.

485
00:34:04,894 --> 00:34:06,484
I think he wants a challenge.

486
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:30,160
Hercules' fists have been dipped
in the blood of the Hydra!

487
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,362
Lethal to anyone but him!

488
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:36,312
Watch!

489
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:49,879
Did you see that?

490
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,656
The gods fight on our side!

491
00:34:54,175 --> 00:35:00,243
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

492
00:35:00,281 --> 00:35:02,243
Hercules! Hercules!

493
00:35:02,268 --> 00:35:05,352
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

494
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:20,414
Battle position!

495
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:32,688
Lady Artemis, if I am to fall,
let me be judged...

496
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:08,167
Stand fast!

497
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,399
Hold your position!

498
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:42,618
Do not yield!

499
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:41,783
No retreat! Stay in the wall!

500
00:37:42,971 --> 00:37:44,432
Hold the lines!

501
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:46,642
Do not yield!

502
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:48,869
Defend Lord Cotys!

503
00:38:16,465 --> 00:38:17,842
The wall has been breached!

504
00:38:21,122 --> 00:38:22,788
Seal up the shield wall!

505
00:38:23,046 --> 00:38:24,663
Defend Lord Cotys!

506
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:32,217
Whip!

507
00:38:43,018 --> 00:38:44,486
Hercules!

508
00:38:45,151 --> 00:38:46,368
Bring the chariots!

509
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:55,925
Defend your Lord!

510
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,934
No!

511
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:26,321
Advance!

512
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,263
Advance!

513
00:40:46,386 --> 00:40:47,387
Make way!

514
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,296
Where is Rhesus?

515
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:23,698
Lord Cotys.

516
00:41:25,373 --> 00:41:27,623
We came here to save this village,

517
00:41:27,988 --> 00:41:30,420
but, no, they killed half my army.

518
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:32,725
Rhesus.

519
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,247
This is all his doing.

520
00:41:35,621 --> 00:41:36,793
And yours.

521
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:38,253
I warned you.

522
00:41:38,278 --> 00:41:41,180
Your men are brave,
but untrained, unprepared for battle.

523
00:41:41,389 --> 00:41:43,563
Give me time to make warriors.

524
00:41:46,913 --> 00:41:47,960
Very well.

525
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:55,948
Cover up, before your loyal army
sees you bleed like a mortal.

526
00:42:06,317 --> 00:42:07,482
Phineas.

527
00:42:07,864 --> 00:42:09,403
You plead your life.

528
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,411
And I gladly offer it.

529
00:42:13,799 --> 00:42:15,346
I failed to see this trap.

530
00:42:15,552 --> 00:42:17,552
The fault is mine!
Spare the other scouts.

531
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:19,077
General Sitacles.

532
00:42:20,215 --> 00:42:22,788
I think we have lost enough men
for the day, don't you?

533
00:42:24,234 --> 00:42:26,328
But just to avoid
future misunderstandings,

534
00:42:26,353 --> 00:42:28,681
I will be taking charge
of your scouts from now on.

535
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,863
Is that clear?

536
00:42:37,005 --> 00:42:38,067
Thank you.

537
00:42:38,843 --> 00:42:40,981
Another mistake, I will end you myself.

538
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,289
I am applying a salve of mint,
chamomile and clay

539
00:43:15,313 --> 00:43:16,717
to seal the wound.

540
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:19,376
This is extract of lithops for the pain,

541
00:43:19,749 --> 00:43:21,016
a powerful sedative.

542
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:23,005
It should rest you after consuming it.

543
00:43:23,508 --> 00:43:25,024
It may have certain side effects.

544
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:26,097
I don't need it.

545
00:43:27,001 --> 00:43:28,344
Forgive me, I forgot.

546
00:43:28,368 --> 00:43:30,971
No mortal can harm Hercules.
And...

547
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:33,098
your lion's hide is...

548
00:43:33,122 --> 00:43:34,352
indestructible?

549
00:43:35,893 --> 00:43:36,852
Drink,

550
00:43:37,274 --> 00:43:38,635
son of Zeus.

551
00:43:41,428 --> 00:43:44,523
Arius' father was the same,
he distrusted medicines.

552
00:43:45,396 --> 00:43:46,397
Where is he now?

553
00:43:47,178 --> 00:43:49,975
Taken by the gods
before my son was born.

554
00:43:50,752 --> 00:43:51,799
I am sorry.

555
00:43:52,835 --> 00:43:54,087
I never knew my father.

556
00:43:55,645 --> 00:43:57,206
Well, he must have been very,

557
00:43:57,230 --> 00:43:58,524
very strong.

558
00:44:02,483 --> 00:44:03,902
Tell me about Arius.

559
00:44:05,364 --> 00:44:06,628
He is a good boy.

560
00:44:06,928 --> 00:44:09,372
And someday, he will make a fine king.

561
00:44:10,501 --> 00:44:11,590
Do you have any children?

562
00:44:15,856 --> 00:44:17,090
Do they live in Athens?

563
00:44:17,581 --> 00:44:18,964
Thank you for your care.

564
00:44:29,943 --> 00:44:31,660
The sedative will help you rest.

565
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:07,375
How could you do such a terrible thing?

566
00:45:07,704 --> 00:45:09,587
By law, I should execute you,

567
00:45:09,612 --> 00:45:12,947
but I believe a more fitting punishment
would be to let you live.

568
00:45:13,337 --> 00:45:15,617
So you can walk the earth in torment,

569
00:45:15,876 --> 00:45:17,163
haunted by the knowledge

570
00:45:17,188 --> 00:45:20,805
that you alone are responsible
for the death of your loved ones.

571
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:24,563
The great Hercules.

572
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:29,092
Hands forever stained
with innocent blood.

573
00:45:30,123 --> 00:45:32,271
Get out, you monster.

574
00:45:33,038 --> 00:45:34,039
Get out!

575
00:46:46,309 --> 00:46:48,668
No!

576
00:47:27,714 --> 00:47:29,750
It happened again, didn't it?

577
00:47:31,555 --> 00:47:35,270
Another vision of Cerberus,
the three-headed beast of Hades?

578
00:47:35,491 --> 00:47:38,620
The gods show you things
they don't share with others.

579
00:47:39,114 --> 00:47:40,699
There is a word for that.

580
00:47:41,516 --> 00:47:42,634
Madness.

581
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:44,620
When we were driven from Athens,

582
00:47:44,826 --> 00:47:47,449
I consulted the Oracle of Delphi
on your behalf.

583
00:47:47,474 --> 00:47:49,079
Do you remember her prophecy?

584
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:53,250
Hercules must finish the Labor
that remains unfinished.

585
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:55,809
And what is that, Hercules?

586
00:47:56,325 --> 00:47:59,939
Confront the beast that haunts you.
Only then will you find peace.

587
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:01,774
I speak from experience.

588
00:48:01,799 --> 00:48:05,394
No matter how far you run, no matter
how fast you go, the beast will follow.

589
00:48:05,989 --> 00:48:08,244
Man cannot escape his fate.

590
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:26,663
Room for one more in your company?

591
00:48:27,968 --> 00:48:29,436
It would be a pleasure having...

592
00:48:29,686 --> 00:48:31,592
female companionship for a change.

593
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:33,273
Atalanta doesn't quite count.

594
00:48:33,297 --> 00:48:34,291
No offense.

595
00:48:34,643 --> 00:48:37,146
If only your manhood
was as long as your tongue.

596
00:48:37,854 --> 00:48:39,606
Both can satisfy in different ways.

597
00:48:43,178 --> 00:48:45,410
You are a famed storyteller, Iolaus.

598
00:48:45,434 --> 00:48:46,853
Grace me with a story.

599
00:48:47,752 --> 00:48:49,545
Any particular subject, My Lady?

600
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:51,792
Murder,

601
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:53,768
of a woman
and her three children.

602
00:48:56,526 --> 00:48:57,548
Is it true?

603
00:48:57,713 --> 00:49:00,592
Did Hercules slaughter his own family?
Who said so?

604
00:49:01,049 --> 00:49:02,363
Soldiers talk.

605
00:49:02,879 --> 00:49:05,576
They say if Hercules
ever returns to Athens,

606
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:07,619
King Eurystheus will have him executed.

607
00:49:12,808 --> 00:49:16,187
Hercules had completed his Labors
and returned home. But Hera...

608
00:49:16,212 --> 00:49:17,150
No myths.

609
00:49:17,603 --> 00:49:18,889
I want the truth.

610
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:20,462
No one knows the truth.

611
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:23,227
Not for sure.

612
00:49:23,826 --> 00:49:25,993
We found Hercules alone.

613
00:49:26,162 --> 00:49:28,524
His wife, Megara and the children dead.

614
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:29,892
He remembers nothing.

615
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:32,623
Do you believe he is innocent?

616
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:34,876
We grew up together,

617
00:49:35,294 --> 00:49:36,420
both orphans,

618
00:49:36,669 --> 00:49:38,395
trying to survive in the streets of Athens.

619
00:49:38,824 --> 00:49:40,048
We found a home in the army.

620
00:49:40,754 --> 00:49:42,059
Looked out for each other.

621
00:49:43,194 --> 00:49:45,304
Hercules' strength...

622
00:49:46,139 --> 00:49:47,415
set him apart.

623
00:49:47,881 --> 00:49:51,230
Kings of Athens started to send him
on all the most dangerous missions.

624
00:49:51,255 --> 00:49:52,420
The Twelve Labors.

625
00:49:52,616 --> 00:49:53,823
And he took me with him.

626
00:49:55,097 --> 00:49:56,425
To fight by his side.

627
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:57,816
And with each mission,

628
00:49:58,136 --> 00:49:59,459
our numbers grew.

629
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,028
Scythia,

630
00:50:01,052 --> 00:50:04,051
the Amazon kingdom where
the royal family had been assassinated.

631
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:06,799
My family was gone.
Everyone was gone.

632
00:50:06,879 --> 00:50:09,149
Hercules helped me avenge their murder.

633
00:50:09,902 --> 00:50:11,461
He became my brother-in-arms.

634
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:15,225
Thebes, the city of corpses,

635
00:50:15,725 --> 00:50:17,677
where we found a single child,

636
00:50:18,402 --> 00:50:19,724
still alive.

637
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:22,404
Hercules took Tydeus in when...

638
00:50:22,712 --> 00:50:25,135
everyone else saw
nothing but a wild animal.

639
00:50:26,901 --> 00:50:28,388
You know how a rumor spreads.

640
00:50:28,412 --> 00:50:29,903
How a legend grows.

641
00:50:30,149 --> 00:50:32,675
Hercules' deeds were so incredible,

642
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:35,703
they could not possibly
have been performed by a mere mortal.

643
00:50:36,075 --> 00:50:38,123
So we played along.

644
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:41,111
We encourage people to think
Hercules was the son of Zeus.

645
00:50:41,757 --> 00:50:42,788
It's good.

646
00:50:43,187 --> 00:50:44,289
Scares the enemy.

647
00:50:44,672 --> 00:50:45,912
Iolaus helps.

648
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:47,836
He talks nice.

649
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:51,108
You are very loyal friends.

650
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:53,680
You are avoiding my question.

651
00:50:55,405 --> 00:50:56,979
Hercules is a warrior.

652
00:50:57,226 --> 00:50:58,978
And there is something
that haunts warriors.

653
00:50:59,003 --> 00:51:00,464
It can cloud their minds.

654
00:51:00,489 --> 00:51:01,505
We call it...

655
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:03,388
the Blood Rage.

656
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:06,397
This rage afflicted Hercules.

657
00:51:06,895 --> 00:51:09,489
He made me vow
to keep the world away from him.

658
00:51:09,875 --> 00:51:12,129
To make sure that he would
never harm innocents again.

659
00:51:12,793 --> 00:51:15,567
And that, My Lady, is the truth.

660
00:51:16,229 --> 00:51:17,606
The truth,

661
00:51:19,907 --> 00:51:21,666
whatever the truth,

662
00:51:22,259 --> 00:51:24,673
the death of his loved ones
haunts Hercules.

663
00:51:25,254 --> 00:51:27,290
Only the gods can help him,

664
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:30,162
if he listens.

665
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:38,542
Come! Gather around,

666
00:51:38,566 --> 00:51:40,448
soldiers of Thrace and behold...

667
00:51:40,563 --> 00:51:43,425
when Hercules gives an order,
even the gods listen.

668
00:51:43,957 --> 00:51:45,995
Zeus' master ironsmith,

669
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:48,239
using the forges of your own citadel,

670
00:51:48,392 --> 00:51:52,558
has crafted these divine weapons
that will make you invincible.

671
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:55,527
As steel is hewn into shields,

672
00:51:56,023 --> 00:51:57,436
so, too will you,

673
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:59,156
be hewn into warriors.

674
00:52:01,491 --> 00:52:02,315
You,

675
00:52:02,463 --> 00:52:05,119
shall carry the shield of Hercules!

676
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:14,383
It's lighter.

677
00:52:14,715 --> 00:52:17,639
Infused with the souls
of Stymphalian birds

678
00:52:17,718 --> 00:52:19,561
from Hercules' sixth Labor!

679
00:52:19,586 --> 00:52:21,001
Spirits of birds?

680
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:23,130
How does that work, exactly?

681
00:52:24,339 --> 00:52:26,558
Well, much as birds take flight,

682
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:30,482
so, too, are these shields
lighter than air. It's in the fibers. Here.

683
00:52:31,291 --> 00:52:33,669
Try on the helmet of Hercules.

684
00:52:40,878 --> 00:52:42,326
It covers my whole face.

685
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:45,108
Forged after Hercules' very own helmet,

686
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,237
when he defeated the demon Geryon.

687
00:52:47,262 --> 00:52:49,029
You sure it was not your horseshit,

688
00:52:49,053 --> 00:52:50,766
that frightened Geryon to death?

689
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:53,948
General Sitacles,

690
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:57,635
perhaps you would care to inspect
the armor of Hercules?

691
00:53:12,853 --> 00:53:14,156
Leather armor?

692
00:53:16,779 --> 00:53:18,873
We will be skewered like pigs.

693
00:53:22,832 --> 00:53:24,333
Linothorax.

694
00:53:25,411 --> 00:53:28,388
Hewn from the skin
of the Erymanthean Boar.

695
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:30,545
It's indestructible.

696
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,221
Wait. If it's indestructible,
how did Hercules cut it off the boar?

697
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:40,651
He used an indestructible blade.

698
00:54:11,107 --> 00:54:11,847
Get up.

699
00:54:14,175 --> 00:54:14,894
Next!

700
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:23,532
Again!

701
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:25,813
Both eyes open.

702
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:29,145
Keep practicing.

703
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:32,803
Firmer grip.

704
00:54:33,971 --> 00:54:35,077
Elbow up.

705
00:54:37,163 --> 00:54:37,833
Good.

706
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:39,624
Shield wall! Form!

707
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:46,458
Stand tall.

708
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:50,541
Excellent.

709
00:55:17,178 --> 00:55:19,021
Careful you don't cut yourself, boy.

710
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:22,236
Again!

711
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:31,707
Rhesus is here.

712
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:34,423
Close enough to stick
a blade between his ribs.

713
00:55:34,978 --> 00:55:35,853
What did you see?

714
00:55:35,878 --> 00:55:36,878
Centaurs.

715
00:55:37,039 --> 00:55:39,385
Half man, half horse.
Hundreds of them.

716
00:55:40,379 --> 00:55:41,756
He saw shadows in the night.

717
00:55:41,922 --> 00:55:44,266
My Lord, I will go ahead
into the Rhesus camp.

718
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:46,598
I will bring word of his plans.

719
00:55:51,722 --> 00:55:54,861
If we let them get past Mount Asticus,
Thrace will fall.

720
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:56,588
You want to stop Rhesus?

721
00:55:57,019 --> 00:55:58,942
We will go through the forest
and they will never see us coming.

722
00:55:58,967 --> 00:56:00,734
It will slow down our chariots.

723
00:56:01,018 --> 00:56:02,080
A gamble.

724
00:56:02,943 --> 00:56:04,056
I have a plan.

725
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,141
The scouts have returned.

726
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:13,753
Rhesus has made his camp
in Mount Asticus, 72 leagues away.

727
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,075
Once these men are ready, we march.

728
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:20,302
So, have you seen if we win or lose?

729
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:24,177
The gods have been annoyingly silent
on that matter.

730
00:56:25,196 --> 00:56:26,438
What they have told me

731
00:56:26,463 --> 00:56:29,387
is that I am soon to discover
there truly is a heaven or a hell.

732
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:32,393
When will you die?

733
00:56:32,703 --> 00:56:35,513
Within a week in a place
that looks an awful lot like hell.

734
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:38,632
As always the gods...

735
00:56:39,013 --> 00:56:40,461
are generous with hints,

736
00:56:40,486 --> 00:56:42,060
but cheap on specifics.

737
00:56:44,839 --> 00:56:46,783
Cheer up, Hercules.

738
00:56:46,808 --> 00:56:48,143
I have lived,

739
00:56:48,479 --> 00:56:50,744
not always well, but long enough.

740
00:56:52,618 --> 00:56:54,432
I am ready for what's next.

741
00:57:00,709 --> 00:57:02,490
Thracians,

742
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:03,776
halt!

743
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:06,161
Shield wall!

744
00:57:06,185 --> 00:57:07,011
Form!

745
00:57:11,178 --> 00:57:12,430
Battle positions!

746
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:17,031
Tydeus?

747
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,237
There is no enemy camp.

748
00:58:05,691 --> 00:58:07,198
This is the right place.

749
00:58:25,419 --> 00:58:26,762
Centaurs!

750
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:28,635
They are real.

751
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:54,372
It seems that we are expected.

752
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:10,968
Centaurs?

753
00:59:32,135 --> 00:59:33,432
Rhesus!

754
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:35,143
You have come looking for a fight,

755
00:59:36,090 --> 00:59:37,867
and we are happy to oblige.

756
00:59:39,164 --> 00:59:40,273
Hercules.

757
00:59:40,523 --> 00:59:41,734
The son of Zeus.

758
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:44,247
Your legend ends here.

759
00:59:44,549 --> 00:59:45,550
Look at me.

760
00:59:46,837 --> 00:59:48,009
Do I look afraid?

761
00:59:56,468 --> 00:59:57,685
Phineas.

762
00:59:59,277 --> 01:00:00,433
Traitor!

763
01:00:00,655 --> 01:00:02,449
Hades will have you!

764
01:00:02,996 --> 01:00:05,035
After it has you, My Lord.

765
01:00:05,675 --> 01:00:07,097
It is over, Cotys.

766
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:10,737
Mount Asticus on your front.
The woods at your back.

767
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,509
And my troops outman you three to one.

768
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:15,350
Surrender now,

769
01:00:16,423 --> 01:00:18,477
and we shall consider being merciful.

770
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:21,624
Men die who speak to my lord
in such a manner.

771
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:29,551
You have made your choice.

772
01:00:45,392 --> 01:00:46,393
Go!

773
01:00:57,946 --> 01:00:59,477
In this moment,

774
01:00:59,798 --> 01:01:01,291
on this day,

775
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:03,231
become the man,

776
01:01:03,255 --> 01:01:05,124
you were born to be!

777
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,694
You have it within yourselves,

778
01:01:07,983 --> 01:01:09,858
to write your own legends!

779
01:01:10,628 --> 01:01:11,948
Let it be to death...

780
01:01:12,839 --> 01:01:14,705
or victory!

781
01:01:19,172 --> 01:01:20,750
Charge!

782
01:01:28,989 --> 01:01:30,143
Shield wall!

783
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:32,897
Flanks out!

784
01:01:42,032 --> 01:01:43,625
Maybe today.

785
01:02:05,305 --> 01:02:06,352
Now!

786
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:27,919
Watch as the Amazon
uses the arrows of Artemis...

787
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:29,462
Silence, boy!

788
01:02:34,769 --> 01:02:36,271
Spears forward!

789
01:02:55,237 --> 01:02:56,659
Archers, ready!

790
01:02:57,732 --> 01:02:58,766
Loose!

791
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:51,828
Advance!

792
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:02,589
Set them aflame!

793
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:08,644
Take cover!

794
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:11,397
Defend Lord Cotys!

795
01:04:31,159 --> 01:04:32,251
Maybe not.

796
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:34,333
Shield wall! Attack!

797
01:04:38,251 --> 01:04:39,628
Push forward!

798
01:04:53,223 --> 01:04:55,463
To kill a snake, cut off its head.

799
01:05:12,534 --> 01:05:14,638
Victory is yours, Lord Cotys!

800
01:05:15,653 --> 01:05:17,231
It is not over yet!

801
01:05:51,981 --> 01:05:53,483
Fucking centaurs.

802
01:05:59,706 --> 01:06:03,882
Hail, Lord Cotys! Hail, Lord Cotys!

803
01:06:04,090 --> 01:06:07,640
Hail, Lord Cotys! Hail, Lord Cotys!

804
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:10,383
Hail, Lord Cotys!

805
01:06:37,494 --> 01:06:38,432
Halt!

806
01:06:45,919 --> 01:06:46,862
Get up.

807
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:49,273
Get up.

808
01:06:56,930 --> 01:06:58,273
Up.
Enough!

809
01:07:09,108 --> 01:07:11,526
You helped a tyrant enslave a nation.

810
01:07:12,529 --> 01:07:15,032
All I did was stop you from
burning more villages.

811
01:07:15,114 --> 01:07:16,536
I burned no villages.

812
01:07:17,075 --> 01:07:18,414
Then who did?

813
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:19,899
Ask yourself,

814
01:07:19,923 --> 01:07:21,046
if Cotys is beloved,

815
01:07:21,071 --> 01:07:23,530
why did he need to hire mercenaries
to do his dirty work?

816
01:07:23,555 --> 01:07:24,876
Keep moving, dog.

817
01:07:25,379 --> 01:07:27,329
You have been fighting on the wrong side.

818
01:08:01,475 --> 01:08:02,584
Where are you going?

819
01:08:03,204 --> 01:08:05,206
I am taking some water to the prisoner.

820
01:08:07,584 --> 01:08:08,676
Sit down.

821
01:08:14,257 --> 01:08:15,759
It's time.

822
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:28,859
Thrace is finally united.

823
01:08:31,276 --> 01:08:32,528
One land,

824
01:08:33,276 --> 01:08:34,472
one King,

825
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:37,816
one Thrace.

826
01:08:38,882 --> 01:08:40,384
One land!

827
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:41,704
One King!

828
01:08:41,954 --> 01:08:42,895
One Thrace!

829
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:45,903
Thrace is not a man, a king, or a god!

830
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:47,786
Thrace is her people!

831
01:08:55,060 --> 01:08:57,609
Who cares what Rhesus claims?
Our work is done.

832
01:08:57,907 --> 01:08:59,534
Let's collect our fee and be gone.

833
01:09:11,559 --> 01:09:12,957
Don't do anything foolish.

834
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:17,090
Where are you going?

835
01:09:24,170 --> 01:09:26,334
I saw pity in your eyes for Rhesus.

836
01:09:26,537 --> 01:09:27,514
Why?

837
01:09:28,031 --> 01:09:29,123
Look at me.

838
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:32,159
Cotys is responsible for this war,
isn't he?

839
01:09:36,047 --> 01:09:37,661
You lie very well.

840
01:09:38,068 --> 01:09:40,060
Clearly, your father's daughter.

841
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:42,458
I didn't do it for my father.

842
01:09:42,911 --> 01:09:44,655
I did it for my son.

843
01:09:45,139 --> 01:09:47,630
If I disobeyed Cotys or resisted
in any way,

844
01:09:47,654 --> 01:09:49,485
Arius would be executed.

845
01:09:49,686 --> 01:09:53,031
I did what any mother would.
I protected my child.

846
01:09:54,232 --> 01:09:56,428
My husband was king.

847
01:09:56,950 --> 01:09:59,506
And Cotys poisoned him
to take his place.

848
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:02,465
Rhesus fought back. Civil war broke out.

849
01:10:02,583 --> 01:10:05,302
Arius is the legitimate king.

850
01:10:07,337 --> 01:10:09,300
My father is old.

851
01:10:09,534 --> 01:10:12,651
He will not live forever,
and once he is gone,

852
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:15,720
my son will be a good king.

853
01:10:16,713 --> 01:10:18,932
And he will heal this land.

854
01:10:19,006 --> 01:10:20,579
That's a dream.

855
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:23,423
And you can help.

856
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:25,459
Please, when you leave Thrace,

857
01:10:25,732 --> 01:10:26,973
take Arius with you.

858
01:10:26,998 --> 01:10:28,360
Please keep him safe.

859
01:10:29,517 --> 01:10:31,019
Find another savior.

860
01:10:31,953 --> 01:10:32,954
Hercules?

861
01:10:35,345 --> 01:10:37,018
The King commands your presence.

862
01:10:42,196 --> 01:10:43,354
My Lady.

863
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:56,919
Champion of Thrace!

864
01:10:57,607 --> 01:10:59,471
Something tells me
we are not gonna get paid.

865
01:11:00,047 --> 01:11:02,323
You could be right.
Oh, shit.

866
01:11:05,903 --> 01:11:07,879
You wanted conquerors, not heroes.

867
01:11:08,723 --> 01:11:10,396
You betrayed me, Cotys.

868
01:11:10,873 --> 01:11:12,161
Betrayed?

869
01:11:13,394 --> 01:11:17,439
A mercenary who has long since
sold his conscience for gold

870
01:11:17,464 --> 01:11:20,143
can hardly presume
to judge his employers.

871
01:11:20,544 --> 01:11:22,909
Let's not quibble about details.

872
01:11:27,074 --> 01:11:29,835
We all know your legend, Hercules.

873
01:11:29,859 --> 01:11:31,362
But here is mine.

874
01:11:31,636 --> 01:11:34,098
When I was a general
in the army of Thrace,

875
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:36,797
I had dreams of ruling this kingdom.

876
01:11:37,251 --> 01:11:40,302
But thanks to you,
my dreams have grown.

877
01:11:40,402 --> 01:11:43,107
I now crave an empire.

878
01:11:43,758 --> 01:11:48,389
My thousands will train more thousands,
and they even more.

879
01:11:48,604 --> 01:11:50,698
The lessons of Hercules will spread.

880
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:53,397
What you began here
can never be stopped.

881
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:54,965
And if you fear,

882
01:11:55,708 --> 01:11:57,530
what such an army may do,

883
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:00,337
then lead it.

884
01:12:04,111 --> 01:12:05,392
You want me...

885
01:12:06,251 --> 01:12:07,690
to serve you?

886
01:12:08,423 --> 01:12:10,845
Spare me the moral outrage.

887
01:12:11,773 --> 01:12:13,025
Child killer.

888
01:12:15,706 --> 01:12:17,071
Getting us all killed,

889
01:12:17,985 --> 01:12:19,184
bad idea.

890
01:12:22,864 --> 01:12:25,245
Well, I must take this...

891
01:12:25,471 --> 01:12:26,536
as a no.

892
01:12:27,434 --> 01:12:28,686
In that case,

893
01:12:30,221 --> 01:12:32,599
your services are no longer required.

894
01:12:36,936 --> 01:12:38,384
You will be paid in full.

895
01:12:38,595 --> 01:12:39,842
Bring them the gold.

896
01:13:21,272 --> 01:13:25,072
If we hurry, we can be spending
our fortunes in Macedonia.

897
01:13:28,571 --> 01:13:29,599
Take mine, too.

898
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:35,377
What do you think you are doing?
Let's go.

899
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:38,416
There will be no more innocent blood
on my hands.

900
01:13:38,473 --> 01:13:40,596
I can't leave without setting this right.

901
01:13:42,368 --> 01:13:43,711
I see.

902
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:47,104
And who is gonna be paying us
for this suicidal endeavor?

903
01:13:47,610 --> 01:13:48,736
Thrace needs our help.

904
01:13:48,841 --> 01:13:50,764
To hell with Thrace. We have gold.

905
01:13:51,990 --> 01:13:53,583
You remember the Black Sea.
That...

906
01:13:53,747 --> 01:13:56,968
beach you spoke of is within reach.
Leave now, be free.

907
01:13:59,477 --> 01:14:00,885
I would never be free.

908
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:06,182
In this fight, you are alone.

909
01:14:09,195 --> 01:14:10,800
Never saw that one coming.

910
01:14:11,322 --> 01:14:13,520
How can you just walk away?
You can't just leave.

911
01:14:13,545 --> 01:14:15,323
Why not?
It's alright.

912
01:14:15,952 --> 01:14:17,941
You have sacrificed your lives for me.

913
01:14:18,136 --> 01:14:19,469
Now you can finally be free.

914
01:14:19,494 --> 01:14:21,879
Whatever debt you feel
you owe me is paid.

915
01:14:22,197 --> 01:14:23,251
Debt?

916
01:14:24,897 --> 01:14:27,165
You think we follow you
because we owe you?

917
01:14:28,923 --> 01:14:30,266
Look around, Hercules.

918
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:32,397
We are family.

919
01:14:33,352 --> 01:14:35,104
All we have, is each other.

920
01:14:36,649 --> 01:14:38,003
We will fight for you.

921
01:14:38,027 --> 01:14:40,028
And if it's our time, we will die for you.

922
01:14:40,559 --> 01:14:42,121
Because you would die for us.

923
01:14:45,259 --> 01:14:47,353
Take that, too. I have no need of it.

924
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:49,322
This is madness.

925
01:14:49,402 --> 01:14:50,626
You want madness?

926
01:14:51,073 --> 01:14:54,587
Tonight, a spear of flame
will pierce my heart.

927
01:14:56,356 --> 01:14:59,030
Is that not the most insane death
you have ever heard of?

928
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:10,619
Crazy.

929
01:15:11,372 --> 01:15:12,390
The lot of you.

930
01:15:12,675 --> 01:15:14,018
Autolycus.

931
01:15:14,767 --> 01:15:15,791
Iolaus.

932
01:15:16,143 --> 01:15:17,575
Go with Autolycus.

933
01:15:18,681 --> 01:15:19,824
I think I will stay.

934
01:15:20,051 --> 01:15:21,052
Nephew.

935
01:15:21,077 --> 01:15:22,339
Uncle, all I have ever done,

936
01:15:22,636 --> 01:15:25,827
is tell stories of great deeds
performed by others.

937
01:15:27,651 --> 01:15:29,387
It's time I stopped telling their stories.

938
01:15:30,591 --> 01:15:32,077
Started living my own.

939
01:15:32,601 --> 01:15:35,677
Well, you may have all
completely lost your minds, but not me.

940
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:38,876
Not me.

941
01:15:42,519 --> 01:15:43,520
Autolycus?

942
01:15:46,959 --> 01:15:48,568
Live like a king, my friend.

943
01:15:59,113 --> 01:16:00,410
What about Cotys?

944
01:16:03,473 --> 01:16:05,106
He paid us to save Thrace.

945
01:16:05,815 --> 01:16:07,032
Let's not disappoint him.

946
01:16:36,258 --> 01:16:37,572
Lay down your arms.

947
01:16:39,845 --> 01:16:41,694
Lay down your arms!

948
01:16:42,412 --> 01:16:44,608
Or your nephew dies first.

949
01:17:01,242 --> 01:17:03,223
I invite you to join me.

950
01:17:03,748 --> 01:17:04,987
You refuse.

951
01:17:05,395 --> 01:17:07,141
I order you to leave.

952
01:17:07,225 --> 01:17:08,378
You return.

953
01:17:08,408 --> 01:17:09,252
Go off.

954
01:17:09,277 --> 01:17:10,840
Get your hands off me.

955
01:17:13,173 --> 01:17:15,868
I overheard her
conspiring with Hercules.

956
01:17:16,641 --> 01:17:19,520
They were planning to remove
the young Prince from your protection.

957
01:17:24,974 --> 01:17:25,975
No.

958
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,923
No! No!
Let go of him!

959
01:17:28,251 --> 01:17:29,286
Don't touch him!

960
01:17:32,439 --> 01:17:34,017
Arius! No!

961
01:17:38,863 --> 01:17:40,799
No! You are hurting him! No!

962
01:17:40,824 --> 01:17:43,425
Hercules, no! Help me! Stop!

963
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:45,309
Help! No!
Arius. No.

964
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:48,171
Arius! No!

965
01:18:35,211 --> 01:18:37,377
Magnificent, are not they?

966
01:18:39,198 --> 01:18:41,371
An extraordinary species.

967
01:18:41,879 --> 01:18:43,527
Incredibly loyal.

968
01:18:43,885 --> 01:18:45,471
As long as they are fed.

969
01:18:46,222 --> 01:18:47,377
Remember them?

970
01:18:47,401 --> 01:18:48,350
Eurystheus.

971
01:18:50,059 --> 01:18:51,356
They remember you.

972
01:18:52,832 --> 01:18:54,051
Confused,

973
01:18:54,551 --> 01:18:55,812
Hercules?

974
01:18:56,575 --> 01:19:01,268
Kingdoms are won with armies,
but empires are made by alliances.

975
01:19:02,071 --> 01:19:04,003
King Eurystheus and I,

976
01:19:04,028 --> 01:19:07,198
will now rule all of Greece.

977
01:19:13,616 --> 01:19:16,790
Cerberus only exists in my mind.

978
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:20,482
Speak a little louder, Hercules.

979
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:23,759
I didn't quite catch that.

980
01:19:25,928 --> 01:19:27,271
The wolves.

981
01:19:30,266 --> 01:19:31,859
They were there that night.

982
01:19:32,726 --> 01:19:34,302
The wolves were there.

983
01:19:34,561 --> 01:19:36,279
You drugged me.

984
01:19:52,955 --> 01:19:55,629
The wolves were there
the night my family was murdered.

985
01:19:59,545 --> 01:20:02,139
My men told me
how your children screamed

986
01:20:03,382 --> 01:20:05,851
as my wolves gnawed on their bones.

987
01:20:08,137 --> 01:20:11,745
As their fangs despoiled your daughter's

988
01:20:12,391 --> 01:20:13,438
pure flesh.

989
01:20:14,727 --> 01:20:15,966
When the people...

990
01:20:16,315 --> 01:20:19,261
called out your name louder
than mine, you see when they...

991
01:20:19,285 --> 01:20:21,843
saw you as a god,

992
01:20:21,868 --> 01:20:24,164
how long before
they saw you as their king?

993
01:20:24,189 --> 01:20:25,710
I wanted nothing!

994
01:20:25,735 --> 01:20:29,285
Precisely! Your sin, Hercules,
was that you had no ambition!

995
01:20:29,325 --> 01:20:32,044
I can deal with an ambitious man!
He can be bought!

996
01:20:32,069 --> 01:20:34,528
But a man who wants nothing
has no price!

997
01:20:37,082 --> 01:20:39,225
Killing you would have
turned Athens against me.

998
01:20:40,419 --> 01:20:41,936
I had to ruin your name.

999
01:20:45,924 --> 01:20:47,267
My wife!

1000
01:20:48,702 --> 01:20:50,207
My children!

1001
01:20:50,273 --> 01:20:53,117
Well, you have our permission
to join them in death.

1002
01:20:53,182 --> 01:20:54,629
All of you!

1003
01:20:54,942 --> 01:20:57,647
Starting with my faithless daughter!

1004
01:20:58,103 --> 01:20:59,915
No! Get off me!

1005
01:21:01,004 --> 01:21:03,145
No! No! No!

1006
01:21:03,192 --> 01:21:05,246
Unhand me! No!

1007
01:21:05,988 --> 01:21:07,850
She is your own flesh and blood!

1008
01:21:07,875 --> 01:21:10,516
I will raise Arius to be my worthy successor!

1009
01:21:10,541 --> 01:21:12,647
You stay away from my boy!

1010
01:21:12,781 --> 01:21:15,012
You monster, you bastard!

1011
01:21:15,294 --> 01:21:17,319
You are a monster!

1012
01:21:17,343 --> 01:21:18,764
You are a monster!
No!

1013
01:21:19,166 --> 01:21:20,989
You are not a man!

1014
01:21:21,013 --> 01:21:22,511
You are a demon!

1015
01:21:23,054 --> 01:21:24,148
Who are you?

1016
01:21:25,255 --> 01:21:26,482
Are you a murderer?

1017
01:21:26,507 --> 01:21:29,151
Damn you! I curse you!

1018
01:21:29,176 --> 01:21:31,614
Are you a mercenary
who turns his back on the innocent?

1019
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,347
Stay away from my son!

1020
01:21:33,514 --> 01:21:34,891
Are you only the legend?

1021
01:21:35,057 --> 01:21:38,795
Or are you the truth behind the legend?

1022
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:40,521
No! Father, please, please, please.

1023
01:21:40,604 --> 01:21:41,764
We believe in you.

1024
01:21:42,689 --> 01:21:44,689
We have faith in you.

1025
01:21:44,714 --> 01:21:46,761
Have faith in yourself.

1026
01:21:46,786 --> 01:21:48,003
Save me!

1027
01:21:48,028 --> 01:21:49,868
Remember the man that you are.

1028
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:51,728
Father, the gods will punish you!

1029
01:21:51,908 --> 01:21:53,676
You cannot escape this time!

1030
01:21:53,701 --> 01:21:55,929
Remember the deeds
you have performed,

1031
01:21:55,954 --> 01:21:57,381
the Labors you have accomplished!

1032
01:21:58,053 --> 01:21:59,928
No! No!

1033
01:21:59,953 --> 01:22:01,842
Stop it!
Leave her alone!

1034
01:22:01,928 --> 01:22:03,727
Now, tell me!

1035
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:04,853
Please!

1036
01:22:04,878 --> 01:22:07,597
Who are you?

1037
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:11,761
I am Hercules!

1038
01:22:21,976 --> 01:22:23,920
Unleash the wolves!

1039
01:22:28,819 --> 01:22:29,820
Get away!

1040
01:22:38,704 --> 01:22:41,628
Three wolves should be
more than enough for one lion.

1041
01:22:45,002 --> 01:22:45,978
Hurry!

1042
01:22:52,718 --> 01:22:53,844
Hurry!
Hurry!

1043
01:22:56,638 --> 01:22:57,905
No!

1044
01:23:24,958 --> 01:23:27,256
The gods have revealed your innocence.

1045
01:23:27,419 --> 01:23:29,763
The final Labor is complete.

1046
01:23:30,172 --> 01:23:31,765
But I am just getting started.

1047
01:23:40,084 --> 01:23:42,694
Doesn't take a vision to know
what's waiting for us up there.

1048
01:24:11,755 --> 01:24:13,265
My time.

1049
01:24:24,393 --> 01:24:26,737
Excuse me.
That was my moment, my fate.

1050
01:24:26,895 --> 01:24:28,317
You are welcome.

1051
01:24:41,323 --> 01:24:42,991
I am going after Eurystheus!

1052
01:25:05,306 --> 01:25:06,673
Hercules, listen to me.

1053
01:25:06,884 --> 01:25:07,953
None of this is my fault.

1054
01:25:07,978 --> 01:25:08,591
You see,

1055
01:25:08,841 --> 01:25:10,510
Cotys poisoned my mind.

1056
01:25:10,534 --> 01:25:12,047
Turned me against you.

1057
01:25:12,816 --> 01:25:14,063
I like you.

1058
01:25:14,234 --> 01:25:15,281
No, stop.

1059
01:25:15,902 --> 01:25:19,089
I command you to stop! I am your King!
You took an oath to obey me!

1060
01:25:19,172 --> 01:25:20,835
You swore to Zeus!

1061
01:25:21,653 --> 01:25:22,811
Wait, wait, wait.

1062
01:25:23,702 --> 01:25:24,983
You fight for gold.

1063
01:25:25,296 --> 01:25:27,551
I have plenty of gold.
Name your price.

1064
01:25:27,999 --> 01:25:30,218
Find it in your heart to forgive.

1065
01:25:35,464 --> 01:25:37,160
You want forgiveness?

1066
01:25:53,667 --> 01:25:56,406
Ask my family for forgiveness.

1067
01:26:14,461 --> 01:26:16,555
I have never killed a god before.

1068
01:26:26,681 --> 01:26:28,476
I really think I am ready to fight now.

1069
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:34,565
Well done, warrior.

1070
01:26:46,618 --> 01:26:48,336
Eurystheus?
Dead.

1071
01:26:48,361 --> 01:26:50,409
We need to find Arius.
Follow me.

1072
01:27:05,512 --> 01:27:06,896
Soldiers of Thrace!

1073
01:27:07,349 --> 01:27:09,003
You followed me in battle.

1074
01:27:09,849 --> 01:27:10,969
Follow me now.

1075
01:27:11,402 --> 01:27:13,010
Don't be fools!

1076
01:27:13,035 --> 01:27:14,759
Hercules is mortal!

1077
01:27:15,228 --> 01:27:16,529
Not a god!

1078
01:27:17,065 --> 01:27:19,222
Anyone who sides with him,

1079
01:27:19,604 --> 01:27:21,053
will die!

1080
01:27:21,903 --> 01:27:23,871
And I will show you.

1081
01:27:24,322 --> 01:27:25,574
Bring him.

1082
01:27:29,898 --> 01:27:31,471
Arius!
Mama!

1083
01:27:31,496 --> 01:27:34,391
No! He is your grandson!

1084
01:27:34,416 --> 01:27:37,169
You failed to save
your children, Hercules.

1085
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:39,346
But you may yet save him.

1086
01:27:39,504 --> 01:27:41,022
Please, Father! No!

1087
01:27:41,047 --> 01:27:42,594
Admit defeat!

1088
01:27:43,216 --> 01:27:44,925
Bow to me!

1089
01:27:45,847 --> 01:27:48,574
You have until the count of three!

1090
01:27:51,266 --> 01:27:52,324
One!

1091
01:27:54,297 --> 01:27:55,298
Two!

1092
01:27:58,210 --> 01:28:00,164
Don't just stand there! Kill someone!

1093
01:28:01,610 --> 01:28:03,112
Protect Lord Cotys!

1094
01:28:06,455 --> 01:28:07,627
Arius, run!

1095
01:28:07,652 --> 01:28:08,947
Mother!

1096
01:28:10,302 --> 01:28:11,463
Get the boy!

1097
01:29:04,673 --> 01:29:05,802
Tydeus!

1098
01:29:09,511 --> 01:29:11,362
Attack!

1099
01:29:11,999 --> 01:29:13,251
Hold them back!

1100
01:29:29,155 --> 01:29:30,577
Spears!

1101
01:29:36,079 --> 01:29:37,725
Go through the fire!

1102
01:29:43,295 --> 01:29:45,748
Here! Here! Help! Come on!

1103
01:29:50,254 --> 01:29:51,490
Easy, Tydeus.

1104
01:30:22,292 --> 01:30:23,489
Hercules.

1105
01:30:44,481 --> 01:30:45,824
Lock shields!

1106
01:30:46,983 --> 01:30:48,231
March!

1107
01:30:50,779 --> 01:30:52,684
Find peace, my brother.

1108
01:31:08,674 --> 01:31:10,661
As you said Hercules,

1109
01:31:10,685 --> 01:31:13,823
there is no way to defeat a shield wall!

1110
01:31:14,302 --> 01:31:16,151
There is no way out!

1111
01:31:17,472 --> 01:31:19,395
Come out and face me!

1112
01:31:26,856 --> 01:31:28,971
You are no hero!

1113
01:31:28,995 --> 01:31:30,363
You are no god!

1114
01:31:30,664 --> 01:31:33,463
You are nothing but a mercenary!

1115
01:31:33,488 --> 01:31:36,207
Your wife and children deserved to die!

1116
01:31:58,763 --> 01:31:59,855
What are you doing?

1117
01:32:00,015 --> 01:32:01,733
Get back up there!

1118
01:32:01,891 --> 01:32:04,106
Hercules must die!

1119
01:32:07,313 --> 01:32:08,481
Come on!

1120
01:32:11,026 --> 01:32:13,930
Kill that filthy bastard!

1121
01:33:14,130 --> 01:33:17,155
Hercules! Hercules!

1122
01:33:17,467 --> 01:33:20,937
Hercules! Hercules!

1123
01:33:21,096 --> 01:33:26,398
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

1124
01:33:26,476 --> 01:33:29,943
Hercules! Hercules!

1125
