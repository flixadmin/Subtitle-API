Life's not fair...

48
00:06:04,622 --> 00:06:06,759
is it, my little friend?

49
00:06:07,724 --> 00:06:10,525
While some are born to feast...

50
00:06:10,527 --> 00:06:13,529
others spend their lives
in the dark,

51
00:06:13,531 --> 00:06:15,466
begging for scraps.

52
00:06:17,234 --> 00:06:19,567
The way I see it...

53
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:23,641
you and I are exactly the same.

54
00:06:26,576 --> 00:06:28,543
We both want to find a way out.

55
00:06:28,545 --> 00:06:30,144
The king approaches!

56
00:06:30,146 --> 00:06:31,713
This is not a drill.

57
00:06:31,715 --> 00:06:33,580
His Majesty has requested
an audience.

58
00:06:33,582 --> 00:06:37,150
Upon his entrance,
you will rise and genuflect.

59
00:06:37,152 --> 00:06:39,552
Zazu...

60
00:06:39,554 --> 00:06:41,922
you've made me lose my lunch.

61
00:06:41,924 --> 00:06:43,958
You will answer to Mufasa

62
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,592
for missing the ceremony
this morning.

63
00:06:45,594 --> 00:06:47,964
I answer to no one.

64
00:06:49,096 --> 00:06:51,964
Scar? Scar. Scar. Scar. Scar. Scar.

65
00:06:51,966 --> 00:06:54,233
No, no, no.
Don't look at me like that.

66
00:06:54,235 --> 00:06:56,803
Are you hungry, Zazu?

67
00:06:56,805 --> 00:06:58,704
Perhaps we could have
a bite together!

68
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:02,142
You can't eat me!

69
00:07:02,144 --> 00:07:05,576
It is forbidden to eat a
member of the king's court!

70
00:07:05,578 --> 00:07:08,146
Ow! No, please! Stop it!

71
00:07:08,148 --> 00:07:10,051
Scar!

72
00:07:12,285 --> 00:07:16,821
Well, look who's come down
to mingle with the commoners.

73
00:07:16,823 --> 00:07:20,693
Sarabi and I didn't see you
at the presentation of Simba.

74
00:07:22,127 --> 00:07:23,863
Was that today?

75
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:29,799
Must've slipped my mind.

76
00:07:29,801 --> 00:07:31,702
Of course I meant no disrespect

77
00:07:31,704 --> 00:07:36,007
towards His Majesty or Sarabi.

78
00:07:36,009 --> 00:07:42,682
As you know, I have tremendous
respect for the queen.

79
00:07:43,314 --> 00:07:44,713
As the king's brother,

80
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:46,649
you should've been
first in line.

81
00:07:46,651 --> 00:07:48,785
I was first in line.

82
00:07:48,787 --> 00:07:51,054
Or don't you remember?

83
00:07:51,056 --> 00:07:54,957
That is, until the precious
prince arrived.

84
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:58,227
Don't turn your back
on me, Scar.

85
00:07:58,229 --> 00:07:59,794
Oh, no, Mufasa,

86
00:07:59,796 --> 00:08:02,063
perhaps you shouldn't
turn your back on me.

87
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,768
Is that a challenge?

88
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:10,139
I wouldn't dream
of challenging you again.

89
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,307
A wise decision.

90
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:14,709
You are no match
for His Royalness.

91
00:08:14,711 --> 00:08:18,879
Well, as far as brains go,
I got the lion's share.

92
00:08:18,881 --> 00:08:20,747
But when it comes
to brute strength,

93
00:08:20,749 --> 00:08:23,317
I'm afraid my big brother...

94
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:24,818
will always rule.

95
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,287
Not always, Scar.

96
00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:30,756
One day, it'll be
my son who rules.

97
00:08:30,758 --> 00:08:33,693
Simba will be your king.

98
00:08:33,695 --> 00:08:36,132
Then long live the king.

99
00:08:38,934 --> 00:08:41,701
What am I gonna do with him?
Oh, come on.

100
00:08:41,703 --> 00:08:43,101
We both know he should've been

101
00:08:43,103 --> 00:08:45,370
expelled from the
Pride Lands long ago.

102
00:08:45,372 --> 00:08:47,273
He's my brother, Zazu.

103
00:08:47,275 --> 00:08:48,707
This is his home.

104
00:08:48,709 --> 00:08:52,111
As long as I am king,
that will never change.

105
00:08:52,113 --> 00:08:54,013
Well, there's one
in every family, sire.

106
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,648
I had a cousin who thought
he was a woodpecker.

107
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:59,384
He slammed his head into trees,

108
00:08:59,386 --> 00:09:00,818
and our beaks
aren't built for it.

109
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,754
He was concussed regularly.
Oh, you've gone.

110
00:09:03,756 --> 00:09:05,926
Uh, sire, coming back!

111
00:10:16,725 --> 00:10:18,294
Simba.

112
00:11:02,134 --> 00:11:04,169
Dad, you awake?

113
00:11:06,371 --> 00:11:08,307
Dad, wake up!

114
00:11:09,174 --> 00:11:10,709
Dad!

115
00:11:11,343 --> 00:11:13,477
Dad, Dad, Dad!

116
00:11:13,479 --> 00:11:16,413
Your son's awake.

117
00:11:16,415 --> 00:11:17,481
Before sunrise,

118
00:11:17,483 --> 00:11:18,981
he's your son.

119
00:11:18,983 --> 00:11:20,816
Come on, Dad, let's go.

120
00:11:20,818 --> 00:11:22,418
You said I could
patrol with you today.

121
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,818
And today has started.

122
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,455
You promised!
You up?

123
00:11:36,098 --> 00:11:37,364
Let's do this!

124
00:11:38,501 --> 00:11:40,368
Let's do this.

125
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:42,003
So, what's first?

126
00:11:42,005 --> 00:11:44,875
Give orders for the hunt?
Chase away evil intruders?

127
00:11:46,242 --> 00:11:49,379
Dad! You're going
the wrong way!

128
00:11:59,388 --> 00:12:00,954
Dad?

129
00:12:00,956 --> 00:12:03,326
I'm not supposed to go up here.

130
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:06,126
Look, Simba.

131
00:12:06,128 --> 00:12:10,396
Everything the light touches
is our kingdom.

132
00:12:10,398 --> 00:12:13,131
You rule all of that?

133
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:14,534
Yes.

134
00:12:14,536 --> 00:12:17,069
But a king's time as ruler...

135
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:20,272
rises and falls like the sun.

136
00:12:20,274 --> 00:12:21,973
One day, Simba...

137
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:25,076
the sun will set
on my time here...

138
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,982
and will rise with you
as the new king.

139
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:33,083
All of this will belong to me?

140
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,187
It belongs to no one,

141
00:12:35,189 --> 00:12:37,823
but will be yours to protect.

142
00:12:37,825 --> 00:12:40,124
A great responsibility.

143
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:42,192
Everything the light touches?

144
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:46,263
Those trees?
And the watering hole?

145
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,032
And that mountain?

146
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:50,466
And beyond those shadows?

147
00:12:50,468 --> 00:12:52,436
You must not go there, Simba.

148
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,038
But I thought a king could do
whatever he wants.

149
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,139
Take any territory.

150
00:12:57,141 --> 00:13:00,375
While others search
for what they can take...

151
00:13:00,377 --> 00:13:03,448
a true king searches
for what he can give.

152
00:13:09,587 --> 00:13:12,387
Everything you see
exists together

153
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:15,357
in a delicate balance.

154
00:13:15,359 --> 00:13:18,960
As king, you need to
understand that balance...

155
00:13:18,962 --> 00:13:21,128
and respect all the creatures...

156
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:25,199
from the crawling ant
to the leaping antelope.

157
00:13:25,201 --> 00:13:28,269
But, Dad,
don't we eat the antelope?

158
00:13:28,271 --> 00:13:32,073
Yes, Simba.
But let me explain.

159
00:13:32,075 --> 00:13:36,343
When we die, our bodies
become the grass...

160
00:13:36,345 --> 00:13:39,380
and the antelope
eat the grass...

161
00:13:39,382 --> 00:13:44,583
and so we are all connected
in the great circle of life.

162
00:13:44,585 --> 00:13:46,952
Sire!
Morning, Zazu.

163
00:13:46,954 --> 00:13:48,520
Do you have the morning report?

164
00:13:48,522 --> 00:13:50,122
Yes, sire.

165
00:13:50,124 --> 00:13:52,292
Ten flamingos
are taking a stand.

166
00:13:52,294 --> 00:13:54,026
Two giraffe were caught necking.

167
00:13:54,028 --> 00:13:55,261
The buzz from the bees...

168
00:13:55,263 --> 00:13:56,395
is that the leopards
are in a bit of a spot.

169
00:13:56,397 --> 00:13:57,396
Ready for some fun?

170
00:13:57,398 --> 00:13:59,265
The birds are tweeting
at 4:00 in the morning.

171
00:13:59,267 --> 00:14:01,100
I'm like,
"Birds, we get it."

172
00:14:01,102 --> 00:14:02,668
Stay low to the ground.

173
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,135
I got this.

174
00:14:04,137 --> 00:14:07,273
Check the wind, the shadows...

175
00:14:07,275 --> 00:14:09,942
and wait for
the perfect moment to pounce.

176
00:14:09,944 --> 00:14:11,043
The cheetahs stole
the baboons' dinner,

177
00:14:11,045 --> 00:14:12,365
and now the baboons
are going ape.

178
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:14,513
Of course, as I say,
cheetahs never prosper.

179
00:14:14,515 --> 00:14:15,648
That's what I say.

180
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,047
Do you get...
I'll say it again.

181
00:14:17,049 --> 00:14:18,649
Cheetahs never...

182
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,024
Come on! It's the news!

183
00:14:26,927 --> 00:14:28,625
That's very good!

184
00:14:30,263 --> 00:14:32,396
Sire!

185
00:14:32,398 --> 00:14:34,531
Sire! Hyenas
in the Pride Lands.

186
00:14:34,533 --> 00:14:35,666
They're on the hunt!

187
00:14:35,668 --> 00:14:37,166
Where's Sarabi?

188
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:38,602
She's leading the charge.

189
00:14:38,604 --> 00:14:40,137
Zazu, take Simba home.

190
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:42,204
Dad, let me come! I can help.

191
00:14:42,206 --> 00:14:45,544
No, son. You stay
with the other cubs.

192
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:48,212
I am not a cub.

193
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,314
Come on.

194
00:14:52,316 --> 00:14:53,985
Let's go home.

195
00:15:05,462 --> 00:15:07,127
Here we are.

196
00:15:07,129 --> 00:15:10,731
Now you go along and
play with the other cubs.

197
00:15:14,503 --> 00:15:16,373
Great.

198
00:16:04,451 --> 00:16:06,351
If you wish to kill something...

199
00:16:06,353 --> 00:16:08,552
you might want to stay downwind.

200
00:16:08,554 --> 00:16:10,554
I know how to hunt, Uncle Scar.

201
00:16:10,556 --> 00:16:13,723
Well, let's hope we're never
attacked by a beetle.

202
00:16:13,725 --> 00:16:18,029
Go back to your den, Simba.
I don't babysit.

203
00:16:18,031 --> 00:16:21,034
Babysit? I'm gonna be the king
of Pride Rock.

204
00:16:23,168 --> 00:16:25,101
My dad showed me
the whole kingdom.

205
00:16:25,103 --> 00:16:27,404
Said I'm going to rule it all.

206
00:16:27,406 --> 00:16:29,105
Is that so?

207
00:16:29,107 --> 00:16:30,340
Think about it.

208
00:16:30,342 --> 00:16:33,308
When I'm king,
I'll have to give you orders.

209
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:35,211
Tell you what to do.

210
00:16:35,213 --> 00:16:37,283
How weird is that?

211
00:16:38,215 --> 00:16:40,417
You've no idea.

212
00:16:42,086 --> 00:16:45,586
So, your dad showed you
the whole kingdom?

213
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:49,224
Did he show you the shadows
beyond the northern borders?

214
00:16:49,226 --> 00:16:53,394
No. He said I can't
go there. Ever.

215
00:16:53,396 --> 00:16:57,532
And he's absolutely right.

216
00:16:57,534 --> 00:17:02,637
An elephant graveyard is no
place for a young prince.

217
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,074
An elephant graveyard?
Whoa.

218
00:17:07,076 --> 00:17:09,543
Oh, dear.
I've said too much.

219
00:17:09,545 --> 00:17:11,745
Though I suppose you'd have
found out sooner or later...

220
00:17:11,769 --> 00:17:14,681
you being king and all.

221
00:17:14,683 --> 00:17:16,415
You've been there?

222
00:17:16,417 --> 00:17:19,519
We've all been there.
And it's no place for a cub.

223
00:17:19,521 --> 00:17:22,155
All those rotting bones...

224
00:17:22,157 --> 00:17:25,358
and burning pools of oozing mud.

225
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,725
Rotting bones?
Oozing mud?

226
00:17:27,727 --> 00:17:31,230
Promise me
you'll stay away, Simba.

227
00:17:31,232 --> 00:17:33,135
Now, you run along.

228
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:38,439
And remember...

229
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,710
it's our little secret...

230
00:17:44,243 --> 00:17:46,213
Your Majesty.

231
00:17:53,453 --> 00:17:55,552
Nala! Come on.
We have to go.

232
00:17:55,554 --> 00:17:57,454
Where?
Watering hole.

233
00:17:57,456 --> 00:17:59,722
Simba, she's having her bath.

234
00:17:59,724 --> 00:18:01,724
And it's time for yours.

235
00:18:01,726 --> 00:18:03,626
But, Mom...

236
00:18:03,628 --> 00:18:05,194
I can do it myself.

237
00:18:05,196 --> 00:18:06,430
Hold still.

238
00:18:06,432 --> 00:18:08,332
You're messing up my mane!

239
00:18:08,334 --> 00:18:10,334
Come on.
Behind the ears.

240
00:18:10,336 --> 00:18:12,337
Come on, Mom!

241
00:18:14,607 --> 00:18:17,707
See? All clean. Can we go?

242
00:18:17,709 --> 00:18:19,408
There's no hyenas.

243
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:22,277
You just chased them all off.

244
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:25,451
Just to the watering hole
and no further.

245
00:18:26,651 --> 00:18:28,517
And stay downwind.

246
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:30,553
And one more little thing.

247
00:18:30,555 --> 00:18:32,687
Zazu will be going with you.

248
00:18:32,689 --> 00:18:33,755
Zazu?

249
00:18:33,757 --> 00:18:34,823
Zazu goes...

250
00:18:34,825 --> 00:18:36,561
or you don't.

251
00:18:40,631 --> 00:18:43,832
Come along. Keep up.
Let's move in a unit.

252
00:18:43,834 --> 00:18:45,467
Okay, buddy system.

253
00:18:45,469 --> 00:18:47,369
So, where are we really going?

254
00:18:47,371 --> 00:18:48,669
How did you know?

255
00:18:48,671 --> 00:18:49,469
You hate the water.

256
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,938
I heard about this place, Nala.

257
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,740
The most incredible, amazing...

258
00:18:53,742 --> 00:18:55,642
Just tell me where.

259
00:18:55,644 --> 00:18:58,678
An elephant graveyard.

260
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,781
Whoa. How far is it?

261
00:19:00,783 --> 00:19:02,650
Not far.
Just to the shadows.

262
00:19:02,652 --> 00:19:04,816
But don't worry,
everyone's been there.

263
00:19:04,818 --> 00:19:06,285
We've never been
that far before.

264
00:19:06,287 --> 00:19:07,520
What if we get lost?

265
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:08,787
Relax, Nala.

266
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:11,925
I patrolled the entire kingdom
this morning with my dad.

267
00:19:11,927 --> 00:19:13,525
There's nothing to worry about.

268
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:16,529
Well, there is one thing.

269
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:19,331
We have an imminent threat.
Something is approaching.

270
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,465
Oh, wait, scratch that.
That's my own shadow.

271
00:19:21,467 --> 00:19:23,401
How we getting rid of the dodo?

272
00:19:23,403 --> 00:19:25,270
Trust me, I got this.

273
00:19:25,272 --> 00:19:26,674
Follow me to freedom.

274
00:19:27,941 --> 00:19:29,840
Oh, how lovely it is...

275
00:19:29,842 --> 00:19:33,445
to see the future king
with his future queen.

276
00:19:33,447 --> 00:19:35,379
I could just molt.

277
00:19:35,381 --> 00:19:36,880
What do you mean,
"future queen"?

278
00:19:36,882 --> 00:19:40,251
Well, one day the two of
you will be betrothed.

279
00:19:40,253 --> 00:19:43,290
Intended. Affianced.

280
00:19:43,856 --> 00:19:45,322
Simba, you speak bird?

281
00:19:45,324 --> 00:19:46,490
Married!

282
00:19:46,492 --> 00:19:49,196
Come on. One day
you will be married.

283
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,230
To each other.

284
00:19:53,232 --> 00:19:54,563
Ugh!
Ew!

285
00:19:54,565 --> 00:19:56,299
Mmm-mmm. That's not
gonna happen, Zazu.

286
00:19:56,301 --> 00:19:57,367
Never ever.

287
00:19:57,369 --> 00:19:58,601
Nala and I are friends.

288
00:19:58,603 --> 00:20:00,971
And besides,
she's afraid of rhinos!

289
00:20:00,973 --> 00:20:02,239
And he's never eaten an impala.

290
00:20:02,241 --> 00:20:03,440
I've tried it once.

291
00:20:03,442 --> 00:20:04,840
We are never
getting married, Zazu.

292
00:20:04,842 --> 00:20:06,909
A monarch who ignores tradition?

293
00:20:06,911 --> 00:20:08,543
With an attitude like that,

294
00:20:08,545 --> 00:20:10,846
I'm afraid you'll be
a pretty pathetic king.

295
00:20:10,848 --> 00:20:13,682
Well, I'm not letting
anyone tell me where to go,

296
00:20:13,684 --> 00:20:14,782
what to do...

297
00:20:14,784 --> 00:20:15,884
and even who to marry.

298
00:20:15,886 --> 00:20:17,885
There will never be
a king like me.

299
00:20:17,887 --> 00:20:21,456
Simba, you can't escape
your destiny.

300
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,490

344
00:22:23,438 --> 00:22:24,771
He's a little lion.

00:22:24,773 --> 00:22:26,639

Mufasa's gonna have my feathers.

This is not good!

364
00:23:24,663 --> 00:23:26,595
Simba, we really lost him.

365
00:23:26,597 --> 00:23:27,898
I know what you're thinking.

366
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,565
"The future king
is a genius."

367
00:23:29,567 --> 00:23:31,101
You can't be serious.

368
00:23:31,103 --> 00:23:33,502
You would've never gotten
away without your queen.

369
00:23:33,504 --> 00:23:34,970
Aren't you forgetting something?

370
00:23:34,972 --> 00:23:36,671
There is no queen.

371
00:23:36,673 --> 00:23:37,773
You could say that again.

372
00:23:37,775 --> 00:23:39,475
I'd rather marry an aardvark.

373
00:23:39,477 --> 00:23:41,075
Good luck finding one
that will say yes.

374
00:23:41,077 --> 00:23:43,045
Good luck getting out of here
without a bruising.

375
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:44,950
Give it your best shot.

376
00:23:48,486 --> 00:23:49,584
Pinned ya!

377
00:23:49,586 --> 00:23:51,518
You owe me an apology.

378
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,989
Never!

379
00:24:02,132 --> 00:24:04,032
Pinned ya. Again.

380
00:24:04,034 --> 00:24:05,467
Nala, stop!

381
00:24:05,469 --> 00:24:06,534
What is that?

382
00:24:06,536 --> 00:24:08,001
You're not gonna
trick me, Simba.

383
00:24:08,003 --> 00:24:10,673
I know that there's nothing...

384
00:24:14,008 --> 00:24:15,812
This must be it.

385
00:24:16,946 --> 00:24:18,081
Come on!

386
00:24:38,867 --> 00:24:40,965
Simba, we're way
beyond the Pride Lands.

387
00:24:40,967 --> 00:24:43,667
We found it, Nala.
You know what this means?

388
00:24:43,669 --> 00:24:45,070
It means we can go home.

389
00:24:45,072 --> 00:24:48,642
It means they won't
treat us like cubs anymore.

390
00:25:37,588 --> 00:25:40,021
Simba, get down!
It could be dangerous.

391
00:25:40,023 --> 00:25:40,957
Danger?

392
00:25:40,959 --> 00:25:44,758
I laugh in the face of danger.

393
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,063
Cool!

394
00:25:49,065 --> 00:25:52,066
You hear that, Nala?

395
00:25:52,068 --> 00:25:53,768
Simba, come on!

396
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:55,603
You've proved how brave you are.

397
00:25:55,605 --> 00:25:56,804
Now the sun is going down,

398
00:25:56,806 --> 00:25:58,772
I'm not just
gonna sit here and...

399
00:26:19,626 --> 00:26:23,661
Well, look at this.

400
00:26:23,663 --> 00:26:27,231
We weren't
expecting guests today.

401
00:26:27,233 --> 00:26:30,235
Would you two cubs...

402
00:26:30,237 --> 00:26:31,835
like to stay for dinner?

403
00:26:31,837 --> 00:26:33,838
Yeah, stay for dinner.

404
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,140
'Cause you look
like a midnight snack!

405
00:26:36,142 --> 00:26:37,976
Can you just give me
a little bit of space?

406
00:26:37,978 --> 00:26:39,142
I'm helping.

407
00:26:39,144 --> 00:26:40,844
We have talked
about this before.

408
00:26:40,846 --> 00:26:42,112
I come in alone.

409
00:26:42,114 --> 00:26:44,649
I'm the lead distraction
so everyone can circle.

410
00:26:44,651 --> 00:26:46,883
Okay, okay. Sorry.

411
00:26:46,885 --> 00:26:48,752
Don't be sorry.
Just do it.

412
00:26:48,754 --> 00:26:49,953
Now, this is a meal

413
00:26:49,955 --> 00:26:52,058
I've waited my whole life for.

414
00:26:56,894 --> 00:27:01,831
What an unexpected treat,
to eat the son of a king.

415
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:04,699
Wait a second, the king?
As in you-know-who?

416
00:27:04,701 --> 00:27:06,167
Who rules you-know-where?

417
00:27:06,169 --> 00:27:09,304
Mufasa does not rule me!

418
00:27:09,306 --> 00:27:11,874
You can't do anything to me!

419
00:27:11,876 --> 00:27:13,912
'Cause I'm the future king!

420
00:27:16,747 --> 00:27:18,280
He's telling me what to do.

421
00:27:18,282 --> 00:27:21,152
His father's strength
flickering inside.

422
00:27:22,386 --> 00:27:24,019
I wonder...

423
00:27:24,021 --> 00:27:26,190
how all that bravery will taste.

424
00:27:26,956 --> 00:27:29,156
Let them go, Shenzi!

425
00:27:29,158 --> 00:27:31,925
They made a mistake,
a horrible mistake!

426
00:27:31,927 --> 00:27:35,995
But if you do this, you will
start a war with Mufasa!

427
00:27:35,997 --> 00:27:37,830
Hyenas and lions
have been at war

428
00:27:37,832 --> 00:27:39,767
since the beginning of time.

429
00:27:39,769 --> 00:27:43,136
But Mufasa's bloodline
will end here!

430
00:27:43,138 --> 00:27:44,672
Run!

431
00:27:50,446 --> 00:27:52,814
Don't let them get away!

432
00:28:04,925 --> 00:28:06,060
Come on!

433
00:28:26,878 --> 00:28:28,379
Did you hear that?

434
00:28:28,381 --> 00:28:30,046
The future king!

435
00:28:30,048 --> 00:28:31,716
Oh, don't hurt me!

436
00:28:31,718 --> 00:28:34,017
Do it again!

437
00:29:08,251 --> 00:29:11,218
If you ever come
near my son again...

438
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:14,257
No, Mufasa. Never.

439
00:29:14,958 --> 00:29:16,389
Never again.

440
00:29:16,391 --> 00:29:19,063
You've been warned, Shenzi.

441
00:29:28,003 --> 00:29:30,807
I thought you were very brave.

442
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:07,241
Zazu?

443
00:30:09,109 --> 00:30:11,345
Take Nala back to Pride Rock.

444
00:30:12,579 --> 00:30:14,311
Yes, sire.

445
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:16,413
Don't be too hard on him, sire.

446
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:20,049
I remember a cub,
a certain headstrong cub...

447
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:22,085
who was always getting
into scrapes.

448
00:30:22,087 --> 00:30:24,922
And he achieved some prominence,

449
00:30:24,924 --> 00:30:26,322
did he not, sire?

450
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:29,161
I have to teach my son a lesson.

451
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,502
Nala, come along.

452
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:44,877
Simba?

453
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:06,492
You deliberately disobeyed me.

454
00:31:06,494 --> 00:31:07,928
I know.

455
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:09,462
You could have been killed.

456
00:31:09,464 --> 00:31:13,400
And what's worse,
you put Nala in danger.

457
00:31:13,402 --> 00:31:16,970
Do you understand
what's at stake?

458
00:31:16,972 --> 00:31:20,907
You jeopardized
the future of our pride.

459
00:31:20,909 --> 00:31:24,043
I just wanted to show you
I could do it.

460
00:31:24,045 --> 00:31:26,112
That I could be brave like you.

461
00:31:26,114 --> 00:31:28,281
I'm only brave
when I have to be,

462
00:31:28,283 --> 00:31:30,350
when there's no other choice.

463
00:31:30,352 --> 00:31:33,419
But you're not scared
of anything.

464
00:31:33,421 --> 00:31:35,053
I was today.

465
00:31:35,055 --> 00:31:36,255
You were?

466
00:31:36,257 --> 00:31:40,327
Yes. I thought
I might lose you.

467
00:31:41,996 --> 00:31:45,200
I guess even kings
get scared, huh?

468
00:31:46,267 --> 00:31:48,900
More than you could ever know.

469
00:31:48,902 --> 00:31:50,901
But guess what?
What?

470
00:31:50,903 --> 00:31:54,437
I think those hyenas
were even scareder.

471
00:31:54,439 --> 00:31:57,641
That's 'cause nobody messes
with your dad.

472
00:31:57,643 --> 00:31:59,510
Come here.

473
00:32:11,923 --> 00:32:13,023
Dad?
Uh-huh?

474
00:32:13,025 --> 00:32:14,590
We're pals, right?

475
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:16,126
Right.

476
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:18,360
And we'll always be together...

477
00:32:18,362 --> 00:32:20,664
right?

478
00:32:20,666 --> 00:32:25,701
Simba, let me tell you
something my father told me.

479
00:32:25,703 --> 00:32:27,970
Look at the stars.

480
00:32:27,972 --> 00:32:30,339
The great kings of the past...

481
00:32:30,341 --> 00:32:33,608
look down on us
from those stars.

482
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:36,078
Really?
Yes.

483
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,414
So whenever you feel alone...

484
00:32:38,416 --> 00:32:41,415
just remember
that those kings...

485
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:44,420
will always be up there
to guide you.

486
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:47,355
And so will I.

487
00:32:47,357 --> 00:32:49,624
But I can't see them, Dad.

488
00:32:49,626 --> 00:32:51,960
Keep looking, son.

489
00:32:51,962 --> 00:32:53,564
Keep looking.

490
00:33:28,729 --> 00:33:30,761
Mufasa is strong.

491
00:33:30,763 --> 00:33:32,663
Like, way stronger than us.

492
00:33:32,665 --> 00:33:34,466
Please give me some space.
What?

493
00:33:34,468 --> 00:33:36,401
You could lay anywhere
in this cave.

494
00:33:36,403 --> 00:33:38,737
Where do you want me to...
I need some personal space.

495
00:33:38,739 --> 00:33:40,574
Okay?
Okay.

496
00:33:42,009 --> 00:33:44,274
Not to take anything away
from you. You were great.

497
00:33:44,276 --> 00:33:45,642
But he is...

498
00:33:45,644 --> 00:33:47,510
See, now I know you're
doing this on purpose.

499
00:33:47,512 --> 00:33:50,213
Very brave, too.
Tough, good energy.

500
00:33:50,215 --> 00:33:51,455
Now you're just being spiteful.

501
00:33:51,479 --> 00:33:52,349
Good posture.

502
00:33:52,351 --> 00:33:53,449
Next time I see Mufasa...

503
00:33:53,451 --> 00:33:56,420
I'm gonna teach him a lesson
he will never forget.

504
00:33:56,422 --> 00:33:58,787
Well, you're in luck!
He's right behind ya.

505
00:33:58,789 --> 00:34:00,425
Mufasa?

506
00:34:14,304 --> 00:34:16,440
That's not the king.

507
00:34:18,074 --> 00:34:21,576
You fools have stripped your
land of every living thing.

508
00:34:21,578 --> 00:34:25,047
And yet I send
two little cubs your way...

509
00:34:25,049 --> 00:34:26,580
and they come back alive.

510
00:34:26,582 --> 00:34:29,453
I guess we'll have to
eat you instead.

511
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:32,186
Why eat one meal...

512
00:34:32,188 --> 00:34:35,823
when you can be feasting
the rest of your lives?

513
00:34:35,825 --> 00:34:38,725
What could you possibly
offer us?

514
00:34:38,727 --> 00:34:41,595
A place where you can
fill your bellies.

515
00:34:41,597 --> 00:34:43,696
Where everything
the light touches

516
00:34:43,698 --> 00:34:45,698
is yours for the kill.

517
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:48,268
The Pride Lands
are not yours to give.

518
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:50,672
The king controls
those hunting grounds.

519
00:35:01,116 --> 00:35:03,584
That's why
we're going to kill him.

520
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:09,455
Mufasa has always shown
too much restraint...

521
00:35:09,457 --> 00:35:12,323
when it comes to hunting.

522
00:35:12,325 --> 00:35:14,459
When I am king...

523
00:35:14,461 --> 00:35:17,361
the mighty will be free to
take whatever they want.

524
00:35:17,363 --> 00:35:21,165
Because a hyena's belly
is never full.

525
00:35:21,167 --> 00:35:23,601
Mufasa's far too powerful

552
00:37:17,576 --> 00:37:19,976
My dad was pretty upset with me.

553
00:37:19,978 --> 00:37:21,978
That's why we're here, Simba.

554
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:25,215
I think I know a way for
you to make it up to him.

555
00:37:25,217 --> 00:37:28,718
A gift that will make him
forget it ever happened.

556
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,921
But he's the king.
What could I give him?

557
00:37:31,923 --> 00:37:33,722
Your roar.

558
00:37:33,724 --> 00:37:34,856
My roar?

559
00:37:34,858 --> 00:37:36,461
Yes!

560
00:37:37,262 --> 00:37:38,894
Did you hear that?

561
00:37:38,896 --> 00:37:43,931
This gorge is where all lions
come to find their roar.

562
00:37:43,933 --> 00:37:45,467
All lions?

563
00:37:45,469 --> 00:37:46,902
Even my dad?

564
00:37:46,904 --> 00:37:50,338
Even Mufasa came here
when he was your age.

565
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,739
Refused to leave...

566
00:37:51,741 --> 00:37:55,779
until his roar could
be heard above the rim.

567
00:37:56,513 --> 00:37:58,012
All the way up there?

568
00:37:58,014 --> 00:38:00,247
That's when you know
you've found it.

569
00:38:00,249 --> 00:38:01,848
With a little practice...

570
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:04,887
you'll never be called
a cub again.

571
00:38:05,722 --> 00:38:07,354
Watch this.

572
00:38:09,425 --> 00:38:11,491
You'll get it, Simba.

573
00:38:11,493 --> 00:38:13,894
Just takes time.

574
00:38:13,896 --> 00:38:16,529
I'll check on you later.

575
00:38:16,531 --> 00:38:19,365
Dad will be so proud, won't he?

576
00:38:19,367 --> 00:38:21,938
It's a gift he'll never forget.

577
00:40:07,134 --> 00:40:08,967
Mufasa! Quick!

578
00:40:08,969 --> 00:40:10,737
Stampede in the gorge!

579
00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:12,105
Simba's down there!

580
00:40:12,107 --> 00:40:13,609
Simba?

581
00:40:14,109 --> 00:40:15,744
I'll find him.

582
00:40:42,869 --> 00:40:44,101
Zazu!

583
00:40:44,103 --> 00:40:46,773
Hold on!
Help is coming!

584
00:40:53,645 --> 00:40:56,047
There he is!
On that tree!

585
00:40:59,718 --> 00:41:02,021
I'm coming, Simba!
Hold on!

586
00:41:07,526 --> 00:41:10,192
I'll help them, Zazu!
You get the pride!

587
00:41:10,194 --> 00:41:11,695
Go!

588
00:41:37,153 --> 00:41:38,555
Dad!

589
00:41:39,154 --> 00:41:40,557
Simba!

590
00:41:41,024 --> 00:41:42,858
Come to me, son.

591
00:41:43,157 --> 00:41:44,659
Jump!

592
00:42:03,743 --> 00:42:06,046
Dad!

593
00:43:01,265 --> 00:43:02,732
Scar!

594
00:43:05,302 --> 00:43:06,904
Help me.

595
00:43:14,677 --> 00:43:18,113
Long live the king!

596
00:43:24,854 --> 00:43:27,057
No!

597
00:43:45,674 --> 00:43:46,940
Dad?

598
00:43:55,249 --> 00:43:56,885
Dad?

599
00:44:22,975 --> 00:44:24,243
Dad?

600
00:44:28,346 --> 00:44:30,015
Dad?

601
00:44:41,392 --> 00:44:43,795
Come on, wake up.

602
00:44:49,733 --> 00:44:54,170
Help! Somebody help!

603
00:45:25,367 --> 00:45:27,433
Simba!

604
00:45:27,435 --> 00:45:29,904
What have you done?

605
00:45:31,739 --> 00:45:33,706
It was a stampede.

606
00:45:33,708 --> 00:45:35,206
He tried to save me.

607
00:45:35,208 --> 00:45:37,777
It was an accident.

608
00:45:37,779 --> 00:45:39,244
I didn't mean for it to...

609
00:45:39,246 --> 00:45:40,279
Of course you didn't.

610
00:45:40,281 --> 00:45:44,082
No one ever means
for these things to happen.

611
00:45:44,084 --> 00:45:46,017
But the king is dead...

612
00:45:46,019 --> 00:45:47,921
and if it weren't for you...

613
00:45:49,321 --> 00:45:51,790
he'd still be alive.

614
00:45:51,792 --> 00:45:54,792
Your father had
such hopes for you...

615
00:45:54,794 --> 00:45:57,994
gave you so many chances.

616
00:45:57,996 --> 00:46:00,731
And this is how you repay him.

617
00:46:00,733 --> 00:46:03,233
I didn't know.
I didn't know.

618
00:46:03,235 --> 00:46:05,335
Oh, what will your mother think?

619
00:46:05,337 --> 00:46:08,938
A son who causes
his father's death.

620
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:14,343
A boy who kills a king.

621
00:46:14,345 --> 00:46:16,848
What am I gonna do?

622
00:46:17,781 --> 00:46:19,415
Run.

623
00:46:19,417 --> 00:46:22,785
Run away, Simba.

624
00:46:22,787 --> 00:46:26,225
Run away and never return!

625
00:46:38,202 --> 00:46:40,872
Kill him.

626
00:47:18,172 --> 00:47:21,342
Go down and make sure he's dead.

627
00:47:29,216 --> 00:47:30,482
Seriously?

628
00:47:30,484 --> 00:47:32,319
Oh, I'm sorry.

629
00:47:34,887 --> 00:47:36,287
That's a good distance
right there.

630
00:47:36,289 --> 00:47:37,323
Okay.

631
00:47:39,258 --> 00:47:42,492
No little cub
could survive that fall.

632
00:47:42,494 --> 00:47:44,128
Listen, we're gonna tell her...

633
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:47,164
we went down there
and we ate him.

634
00:47:47,166 --> 00:47:49,166
Uh-huh. That's perfect,
'cause I am starving!

635
00:47:49,168 --> 00:47:50,967
We're not gonna eat him.

636
00:47:50,969 --> 00:47:52,168
Simba is dead.

637
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:54,973
That's all she ever has to know.

638
00:47:56,574 --> 00:47:58,143
Works for me.

639
00:48:52,227 --> 00:48:57,463
Mufasa's death
is a terrible tragedy.

640
00:48:57,465 --> 00:49:01,099
The greatest leader
the pride has ever known.

641
00:49:01,101 --> 00:49:03,436
To lose a brother...

642
00:49:03,438 --> 00:49:09,175
such a deep, personal loss.

643
00:49:09,177 --> 00:49:13,111
And little Simba,
who had barely begun to live.

644
00:49:13,113 --> 00:49:16,915
A cub whose blood
held our future.

645
00:49:16,917 --> 00:49:20,919
It's almost too much to endure.

646
00:49:20,921 --> 00:49:24,256
I only wish I had gotten
to the gorge in time...

647
00:49:24,258 --> 00:49:28,425
been there to save them.

648
00:49:28,427 --> 00:49:33,463
And so it is
with a heavy heart...

649
00:49:33,465 --> 00:49:36,267
that I must assume the throne.

650
00:49:36,269 --> 00:49:39,202
Mufasa and Simba are gone...

651
00:49:39,204 --> 00:49:43,308
which means I am your king.

652
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:47,210
But I must admit...

653
00:49:47,212 --> 00:49:50,216
I cannot bear this burden alone.

654
00:49:51,348 --> 00:49:53,949
And I will need some help...

655
00:49:53,951 --> 00:49:55,652
to ensure

656
00:49:55,654 --> 00:49:58,189
the safety of the pride.

657
00:50:05,496 --> 00:50:08,562
Nala, stay close.

658
00:50:08,564 --> 00:50:12,700
And so, from the ashes
of this tragedy...

659
00:50:12,702 --> 00:50:17,605
we shall welcome
the dawning of a new era.

660
00:50:17,607 --> 00:50:19,176
A great...

661
00:50:19,942 --> 00:50:23,110
and glorious future!

662
00:50:33,454 --> 00:50:36,055
Oh, dear.

663
00:52:20,653 --> 00:52:21,653
I missed 'em!

664
00:52:21,655 --> 00:52:24,057
I'm gonna get one of
those vultures one day.

665
00:52:24,059 --> 00:52:25,390
I'm gonna get one!

666
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:27,032
I don't know why it's
so important to you.

667
00:52:27,056 --> 00:52:29,162
I just feel like it would
make me feel better.

668
00:52:29,164 --> 00:52:31,164
Oh, no.
It's a little lion!

669
00:52:31,166 --> 00:52:33,332
That is not a lion.
Well then, go check it out.

670
00:52:33,334 --> 00:52:34,534
What is it?
That is not a lion,

671
00:52:34,558 --> 00:52:35,501
it's a furry bird!

672
00:52:35,503 --> 00:52:37,202
It looks like a lion!

673
00:52:37,204 --> 00:52:39,603
That's not a lion. Let me get
a closer look. Excuse me.

674
00:52:39,605 --> 00:52:42,641
All right, let me see
what we're dealing with here.

675
00:52:42,643 --> 00:52:44,141
It's a lion!

676
00:52:44,143 --> 00:52:45,863
Run for your life, Pumbaa!
Wait! Hey, Timon.

677
00:52:45,887 --> 00:52:48,179
Wait, Timon, wait!
It's a little lion!

678
00:52:48,181 --> 00:52:49,447
It gets bigger.

679
00:52:49,449 --> 00:52:51,482
Can we keep him?
Can we please keep him?

680
00:52:51,484 --> 00:52:53,485
Oh, oh, okay. I promise
I'll walk him every day!

681
00:52:53,487 --> 00:52:55,207
If he makes a little mess,
I'll clean it up.

682
00:52:55,231 --> 00:52:56,653
You'll be his little mess!

683
00:52:56,655 --> 00:52:58,815
He's gonna eat you and then
use my body as a toothpick!

684
00:52:58,839 --> 00:53:00,490
But one day,
when he's big and strong,

685
00:53:00,492 --> 00:53:01,758
he'll be on our side!

686
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,595
I've got it. What if
he's on our side?

687
00:53:04,597 --> 00:53:05,863
Hear me out!

688
00:53:05,865 --> 00:53:10,099
Having a ferocious lion around
might not be such a bad idea!

689
00:53:10,101 --> 00:53:11,400
Well then, can we keep him?

690
00:53:11,402 --> 00:53:12,735
Yes, of course we can keep him!

691
00:53:12,737 --> 00:53:15,471
My God, who is the brains
of this operation?

692
00:53:15,473 --> 00:53:17,607
♪ We're gonna name him Fred! ♪

693
00:53:17,609 --> 00:53:20,342
Who are you?

694
00:53:20,344 --> 00:53:21,864
Uh, we're the guys
who saved your life.

695
00:53:21,888 --> 00:53:22,779
Yes.

696
00:53:22,781 --> 00:53:25,148
Risked everything.
Fought off angry vultures!

697
00:53:25,150 --> 00:53:26,814
Hordes of them. Flocks.

698
00:53:26,816 --> 00:53:28,350
I'm Pumbaa.

699
00:53:28,352 --> 00:53:29,551
This is Timon.
Did I mention

700
00:53:29,553 --> 00:53:31,220
that we saved your life?

701
00:53:31,222 --> 00:53:33,390
It doesn't matter.

702
00:53:35,126 --> 00:53:37,158
Whoa. How bleak is that?

703
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:39,127
It doesn't even matter?

704
00:53:39,129 --> 00:53:40,629
Like I don't have enough
that I'm dealing with, right?

705
00:53:40,631 --> 00:53:41,911
Now his problems
are my problems?

706
00:53:41,935 --> 00:53:44,565
But we can help him.
We're in a position to help him.

707
00:53:44,567 --> 00:53:49,137
So, how are you,
in as few words as possible?

708
00:53:49,139 --> 00:53:51,172
I did something terrible.

709
00:53:51,174 --> 00:53:53,173
I don't wanna talk about it.

710
00:53:53,175 --> 00:53:55,610
Look, kid, we've all
made mistakes.

711
00:53:55,612 --> 00:53:58,511
Uh, there must be
something we can do, right?

712
00:53:58,513 --> 00:54:00,647
Not unless you can
change the past.

713
00:54:00,649 --> 00:54:02,248
Well, you know,
that's a lot to ask...

714
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:03,650
That's pretty hard.
That's a biggie.

715
00:54:03,674 --> 00:54:04,651
If I'm being honest.

716
00:54:04,653 --> 00:54:06,413
I mean, change the past?
It already happened.

717
00:54:06,437 --> 00:54:07,754
Yeah, so you can't change that.

718
00:54:07,756 --> 00:54:10,290
But you know
what you can change?

719
00:54:10,292 --> 00:54:12,459
The future.
That's our specialty.

720
00:54:12,461 --> 00:54:13,825
Kind of our thing.

721
00:54:13,827 --> 00:54:16,528
How can you change something
that hasn't happened?

722
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:18,630
Well, to change the future,

723
00:54:18,632 --> 00:54:20,398
you gotta put your past
behind you.

724
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,432
Way behind.

725
00:54:21,434 --> 00:54:23,702
Look, kid, bad things happen

726
00:54:23,704 --> 00:54:26,204
and you can't do anything
about it, right?

727
00:54:26,206 --> 00:54:27,472
Right.

728
00:54:27,474 --> 00:54:29,940
Wrong! When the world
turns its back on you...

729
00:54:29,942 --> 00:54:32,377
you turn your back on the world!

730
00:54:32,379 --> 00:54:34,344
And only embrace what's next!

731
00:54:34,346 --> 00:54:36,381
And turn the "what"
into "so what?"

732
00:54:36,383 --> 00:54:38,582
Well, that's not
what I was taught.

733
00:54:38,584 --> 00:54:40,585
Well, then maybe
you need a new lesson.

734
00:54:40,587 --> 00:54:45,588
Repeat after me, kid.
Hakuna matata.

735
00:54:45,590 --> 00:54:47,823
What?
Hakuna matata.

736
00:54:47,825 --> 00:54:49,358
Hakuna matata.

737
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,640
Most people get
a bigger reaction

738
00:54:50,642 --> 00:54:51,876
when we say it the first...

739
00:54:51,878 --> 00:54:53,564
Okay, well anyway.
Hakuna matata.

740
00:54:53,566 --> 00:54:55,086
Some people start
clapping immediately.

741
00:54:55,110 --> 00:54:57,300
It means "no worries."
One and a...

742

I do the counting here.

743
00:54:59,271 --> 00:55:01,437
I wanna count!
Why don't we count together?

744
00:55:01,439 --> 00:55:02,839
Okay, that's a good idea.
All right.

745
00:55:02,863 --> 00:55:04,873

Welcome to our humble home.

00:57:02,953 --> 00:57:03,852
You live here?

787
00:57:03,854 --> 00:57:05,754
Well, we live wherever we want.

788
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:07,355
We do as we please.

789
00:57:07,357 --> 00:57:08,589
It's beautiful.

790
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:11,059
Yeah, it's really nice, huh?

791
00:57:11,061 --> 00:57:14,095
Everyone, this is Simba.

792
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:16,331
That, my friend, is a lion.

793
00:57:16,333 --> 00:57:17,631
What about food?

794
00:57:17,633 --> 00:57:19,273
Have you thought
about feeding that thing?

795
00:57:19,297 --> 00:57:21,369
Yeah, I'm starved!
I could eat a whole zebra.

796
00:57:21,371 --> 00:57:22,736
Here we go.

797
00:57:22,738 --> 00:57:25,504
Uh, no, no, no, kid,
we're fresh out of zebra.

798
00:57:25,506 --> 00:57:26,739
Any antelope?

799
00:57:26,741 --> 00:57:28,674
Uh-oh.
No, listen, kid...

800
00:57:28,676 --> 00:57:30,844
if you want to live with us,
you have to eat like us.

801
00:57:30,846 --> 00:57:34,080
And most importantly,
not eat us!

802
00:57:34,082 --> 00:57:37,653
This looks like a good
spot to rustle up some grub!

803
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:40,687
Yeah!
It's perfect!

804
00:57:40,689 --> 00:57:42,021
Step aside, fellas!

805
00:57:42,023 --> 00:57:43,555
Ugh. What's that?

806
00:57:43,557 --> 00:57:44,689
Ooh. Too chewy.

807
00:57:44,691 --> 00:57:46,392
This one's got some nuttiness!

808
00:57:46,394 --> 00:57:48,760
Mmm. Now that's what
I call umami!

809
00:57:48,762 --> 00:57:51,463
Slimy, yet satisfying.

810
00:57:51,465 --> 00:57:52,765
Mmm. Extra crunchy.

811
00:57:52,767 --> 00:57:54,099
They're local.
Yeah. Oh, are they?

812
00:57:54,101 --> 00:57:55,633
They're from right there.

813
00:57:55,635 --> 00:57:57,902
I'm telling ya, kid,
this is the great life.

814
00:57:57,904 --> 00:57:59,002
No rules.

815
00:57:59,004 --> 00:58:00,804
No responsibilities.

816
00:58:00,806 --> 00:58:03,641
Ooh! The little
cream-filled kind.

817
00:58:03,643 --> 00:58:04,909
I love these!

818
00:58:04,911 --> 00:58:06,043
Those are good.
I love these.

819
00:58:06,045 --> 00:58:06,811
Those are the best.

820

Can I have the head?

821
00:58:08,147 --> 00:58:09,516
Well, kid?

822
00:58:10,449 --> 00:58:12,049
Oh, well.

823
00:58:12,051 --> 00:58:13,786
Hakuna matata.

824
00:58:16,921 --> 00:58:18,657
Slimy...

825
00:58:19,425 --> 00:58:21,925
yet satisfying.

826

That's it!

Oh, no,
I think we did it. Yeah.

I think we got this one.

01:00:31,716 --> 01:00:34,215
Zazu, where have you been?

870
01:00:34,217 --> 01:00:38,086
I'm sorry, Nala.
I came as soon as I could.

871
01:00:42,591 --> 01:00:44,225
The morning report, Zazu.

872
01:00:44,227 --> 01:00:47,562
Your Majesty, the Pride Lands
are in imminent danger.

873
01:00:47,564 --> 01:00:50,798
The hyenas are chasing off
the last of the herds.

874
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:52,002
The bird's back!

875
01:00:53,601 --> 01:00:55,038
Get him!

876
01:00:59,074 --> 01:01:02,045
Don't come here again,
unless you want to be eaten!

877
01:01:25,132 --> 01:01:28,632
We have to do something,
Sarabi. We have to fight!

878
01:01:28,634 --> 01:01:32,269
Nala. Scar is the king.

879
01:01:32,271 --> 01:01:33,972
But you are our queen!

880
01:01:33,974 --> 01:01:36,141
We should leave
before it's too late!

881
01:01:36,143 --> 01:01:40,344
We must all stay together
and protect the Pride Lands.

882
01:01:40,346 --> 01:01:44,113
This is our home.
We must never abandon it.

883
01:01:44,115 --> 01:01:46,584
This isn't the home I remember.

884
01:01:46,586 --> 01:01:49,319
Our time will come, Nala.

885
01:01:49,321 --> 01:01:50,788
Be patient.

886
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:52,192
Sarabi.

887
01:01:53,859 --> 01:01:55,895
The king wishes to see you.

888
01:01:56,629 --> 01:01:58,197
Don't go.

889
01:01:59,331 --> 01:02:01,967
I'm not afraid of him.

890
01:02:16,946 --> 01:02:19,246
Won't you join me, Sarabi?

891
01:02:19,248 --> 01:02:21,716
There's plenty to go around.

892
01:02:21,718 --> 01:02:23,652
You're over-hunting, Scar.

893
01:02:23,654 --> 01:02:26,621
I've simply perfected the kill.

894
01:02:26,623 --> 01:02:28,022
With the help of my army.

895
01:02:28,024 --> 01:02:30,825
You're killing everything.

896
01:02:30,827 --> 01:02:34,028
Don't you see? There is nobody
to challenge me.

897
01:02:34,030 --> 01:02:36,800
We can finally take
whatever we want.

898
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,765
We?

899
01:02:38,767 --> 01:02:42,637
Long ago
you chose Mufasa over me.

900
01:02:42,639 --> 01:02:44,971
But now there is a new king.

901
01:02:44,973 --> 01:02:47,674
So stop being so selfish.

902
01:02:47,676 --> 01:02:49,643
You are the selfish one.

903
01:02:49,645 --> 01:02:51,344
The other lions look to you.

904
01:02:51,346 --> 01:02:55,214
As long as you resist
they will reject me.

905
01:02:55,216 --> 01:03:00,420
Take your place by my side,
and we will feast together.

906
01:03:00,422 --> 01:03:03,591
I will never be your queen!

907
01:03:05,059 --> 01:03:06,959
Then from now on...

908
01:03:06,961 --> 01:03:11,196
the lions will eat
after the hyenas.

909
01:03:11,198 --> 01:03:13,966
And they don't
leave much behind.

910
01:04:43,984 --> 01:04:45,083
Just what do you think

911
01:04:45,085 --> 01:04:47,120
you are doing, young lady?

912
01:04:47,122 --> 01:04:48,788
Go away, Zazu.

913
01:04:48,790 --> 01:04:50,522
I'm going to find help.

914
01:04:50,524 --> 01:04:52,457
I will very much not go away.

915
01:04:52,459 --> 01:04:54,059
I am sworn to protect you

916
01:04:54,061 --> 01:04:56,061
and must order you back to bed.

917
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:59,032
I don't need protecting anymore.

918
01:05:49,112 --> 01:05:52,079
Uh, Scar!
Uh, wonderful to see you.

919
01:05:52,081 --> 01:05:54,081
Uh, sorry to drop in like this!

920
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:55,449
Ah!

921
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:58,352
Have I ever told you
about my brother

922
01:05:58,354 --> 01:06:01,522
who thought he was a woodpecker?

923
01:06:14,402 --> 01:06:16,138
Nala...

924
01:06:39,627 --> 01:06:41,326
Oh, I'm gonna get ya!

925
01:06:41,328 --> 01:06:43,194
I'm gonna get ya!
Oh, I got ya!

926
01:06:43,196 --> 01:06:45,028
Oh.

927
01:06:45,030 --> 01:06:46,998
Simba! It's you!

928
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,298
Did you see that?

929
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:50,001
Man, that butterfly
was right there!

930
01:06:50,003 --> 01:06:51,302
I almost had him.

931
01:06:51,304 --> 01:06:52,637
I thought it was a lion.

932
01:06:52,639 --> 01:06:54,572
You know,
the other kind of lion.

933
01:06:54,574 --> 01:06:55,907
You know, a real lion?

934
01:06:55,909 --> 01:06:57,507
I mean, not that
you're not a real lion.

935
01:06:57,509 --> 01:06:59,878
But you know,
the kind that eats...

936
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:01,944
I'm gonna go.

937
01:07:01,946 --> 01:07:03,614
Hey, where you going?

938
01:07:03,616 --> 01:07:06,216
You wanna get some grubs?

939
01:07:08,654 --> 01:07:10,319
What's up with that guy?

940
01:07:10,321 --> 01:07:12,154
Um, Simba...

941
01:07:12,156 --> 01:07:14,091
How can I say this?

942
01:07:14,093 --> 01:07:15,893
He's prey.
Yeah.

943
01:07:15,895 --> 01:07:20,195
And he is never gonna want to
frolic with a carnivore.

944
01:07:20,197 --> 01:07:22,430
No. You two will
never frolic.

945
01:07:22,432 --> 01:07:23,599
Why not?

946
01:07:23,601 --> 01:07:28,470
You see, in nature
there's a delicate balance.

947
01:07:28,472 --> 01:07:30,472
Oh, yeah. The circle of life.
I know that.

948
01:07:30,474 --> 01:07:32,340
No.
No, no, no.

949
01:07:32,342 --> 01:07:33,540
I don't know where you're
getting "circle" from.

950
01:07:33,542 --> 01:07:34,442
No, yeah.

951
01:07:34,444 --> 01:07:36,176
There's no circle of life.

952
01:07:36,178 --> 01:07:37,645
No, it's no circle.
No, not at all.

953
01:07:37,647 --> 01:07:39,214
In fact, it's the opposite.
Yeah.

954
01:07:39,216 --> 01:07:40,515
It's a line.
Yeah.

955
01:07:40,517 --> 01:07:42,984
It's a meaningless line
of indifference.

956
01:07:42,986 --> 01:07:45,520
And we're all just running
towards the end of the line.

957
01:07:45,522 --> 01:07:49,155
And then one day we'll reach
the end, and that'll be it.

958
01:07:49,157 --> 01:07:50,356
That's it.
Line over!

959
01:07:50,358 --> 01:07:52,258
Nothing.
Nada.

960
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:53,540
And you can really just kinda...

961
01:07:53,564 --> 01:07:55,361
do your own thing
and fend for yourself...

962
01:07:55,363 --> 01:07:57,403
'cause your line doesn't
affect anyone else's lines.

963
01:07:57,427 --> 01:07:59,999
You're alive and then
you're not. Like this guy.

964
01:08:00,001 --> 01:08:01,200
Mmm.

965
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:03,336
You sure it's not a circle?

966
01:08:03,338 --> 01:08:05,203
That we're all connected?

967
01:08:05,205 --> 01:08:07,507
A circle would mean
we're all this.

968
01:08:07,509 --> 01:08:09,976
That would mean
what I do affects him...

969
01:08:09,978 --> 01:08:11,511
affects that thing,
affects that thing.

970
01:08:11,513 --> 01:08:13,279
Yeah. No.
That's not how it goes.

971
01:08:13,281 --> 01:08:15,114
Which would make
doing whatever we wanted

972
01:08:15,116 --> 01:08:16,348
not that cool.

973
01:08:16,350 --> 01:08:17,950
Let me simplify this for you.

974
01:08:17,952 --> 01:08:19,651
Life is meaningless.
Yes.

975
01:08:19,653 --> 01:08:22,020
That's why you just gotta
look out for yourself.

976
01:08:22,022 --> 01:08:23,387
That's why you do you, Simba.

977
01:08:23,389 --> 01:08:25,623
Yeah, Simba,
for the first time...

978
01:08:25,625 --> 01:08:28,126
we're entrusting you to
make a plan for us today.

979
01:08:28,128 --> 01:08:31,128
This is important.
Think about all you've been taught.

980
01:08:31,130 --> 01:08:33,267
What do you wanna do?

981
01:08:34,134 --> 01:08:37,170
Absolutely nothing.

982
01:08:38,370 --> 01:08:40,237
Whoo-hoo!
Exactly! He gets it!

983
01:08:40,239 --> 01:08:42,105
Jackpot!

984
01:08:42,107 --> 01:08:43,506
Out of my way!
Out of my way!

985
01:08:43,508 --> 01:08:45,913
Crunchy!
All right! Time to eat!

986
01:08:56,288 --> 01:08:58,420
Oh.

987
01:08:58,422 --> 01:09:00,724
Hello!

988
01:09:00,726 --> 01:09:02,559
Nice one, Simba.

989
01:09:02,561 --> 01:09:05,394
Oh, thanks.
Must've been the termites.

990
01:09:05,396 --> 01:09:07,397
Or the crickets.

991
01:09:09,033 --> 01:09:11,569
And you wonder why I prefer
to sleep underground.

992
01:09:12,202 --> 01:09:14,169
Hey, Timon.

993
01:09:14,171 --> 01:09:15,470
Do you ever look up there

994
01:09:15,472 --> 01:09:17,705
and wonder what
those sparkly dots are?

995
01:09:17,707 --> 01:09:22,010
Oh, Pumbaa.
I don't wonder. I know.

996
01:09:22,012 --> 01:09:24,213
Really?
What are they?

997
01:09:24,215 --> 01:09:25,680
They're fireflies.

998
01:09:25,682 --> 01:09:30,051
Fireflies that got stuck on that
big, bluish-black thing.

999
01:09:30,053 --> 01:09:31,218
Oh.

1000
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:32,486
I guess that makes sense.

1001
01:09:32,488 --> 01:09:34,521
I always thought
they were balls of gas

1002
01:09:34,523 --> 01:09:36,691
burning billions of miles away.

1003
01:09:36,693 --> 01:09:39,526
Oh, Pumbaa, why is everything
always gas with you?

1004
01:09:39,528 --> 01:09:41,261
I know.

1005
01:09:41,263 --> 01:09:43,096
What do you think, Simba?
Yeah.

1006
01:09:43,098 --> 01:09:45,401
Oh, I don't know.

1007
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:48,401
But somebody once told me...

1008
01:09:48,403 --> 01:09:50,636
the great kings of the past
are up there...

1009
01:09:50,638 --> 01:09:54,043
and they're all
watching over us.

1010
01:09:58,311 --> 01:10:02,081
That's a good one!
That's insane!

1011
01:10:02,083 --> 01:10:04,750
That's insane!

1012
01:10:04,752 --> 01:10:07,053
Royal dead guys
watching over us!

1013
01:10:07,055 --> 01:10:09,287
Well, I hope they don't
fall out of the sky!

1014
01:10:09,289 --> 01:10:12,090
Hang on, Your Majesty!
Don't let go!

1015
01:10:12,092 --> 01:10:13,625
Oh, that would be a mess.

1016
01:10:13,627 --> 01:10:14,591
Oh, man!

1017
01:10:14,593 --> 01:10:16,193
I mean, Simba, think about it.

1018
01:10:16,195 --> 01:10:18,228
Why would a bunch of kings
be looking out for us?

1019
01:10:18,230 --> 01:10:19,330
We're outcasts.

1020
01:10:19,332 --> 01:10:20,397
Royal warthogs!

1021
01:10:20,399 --> 01:10:21,633
I can't! I can't!

1022
01:10:21,635 --> 01:10:23,233
I can't!
I actually can't.

1023
01:10:23,235 --> 01:10:24,268
I can't.

1024
01:10:24,270 --> 01:10:26,838
No, you can.
I can't.

1025
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:31,174
Yeah. Yeah.

1026
01:10:31,176 --> 01:10:33,276
Yeah.

1027
01:10:33,278 --> 01:10:34,745
That's stupid.

1028
01:10:34,747 --> 01:10:39,252
I'm gonna go get some grubs
or something.

1029
01:10:46,090 --> 01:10:47,355
What did you say to him?

1030
01:10:47,357 --> 01:10:48,524
I don't know.

1031
01:10:48,526 --> 01:10:49,758
As you were saying it,

1032
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:51,461
I thought,
"This won't end well."

1033
01:10:51,463 --> 01:10:52,727
You just start laughing.

1034
01:10:52,729 --> 01:10:54,129
You laughed too.

1035
01:10:54,131 --> 01:10:56,199
I did not.
I would never.

1036
01:10:57,434 --> 01:10:59,604
Man, I blew it.

1037
01:14:05,043 --> 01:14:06,813
Simba.

1038
01:14:11,951 --> 01:14:15,688

Move! Move! Move!

1070

No!

1071
01:16:40,822 --> 01:16:42,424
Oh, no! Oh, no!

1072
01:16:42,924 --> 01:16:44,490
No!

1073
01:17:02,509 --> 01:17:03,842
Nala?

1074
01:17:03,844 --> 01:17:06,578
Simba?

1075
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:08,546
Is that really you?

1076
01:17:08,548 --> 01:17:09,781
Yeah.

1077
01:17:09,783 --> 01:17:11,750
It's me, Simba!

1078
01:17:13,854 --> 01:17:15,174
Nala, what're you doing?
Oh, my...

1079
01:17:15,198 --> 01:17:16,188
I don't believe it!

1080
01:17:16,190 --> 01:17:17,621
Look at you!

1081
01:17:17,623 --> 01:17:18,857
Pumbaa...

1082
01:17:18,859 --> 01:17:20,658
I don't think
you're getting eaten.

1083
01:17:20,660 --> 01:17:22,594
Oh, where have you been?

1084
01:17:22,596 --> 01:17:24,161
I thought you were dead!

1085
01:17:24,163 --> 01:17:26,996
You thought he was dead.
I thought I was dead!

1086
01:17:26,998 --> 01:17:29,232
I thought you were gonna eat me.

1087
01:17:29,234 --> 01:17:31,201
What fun!

1088
01:17:31,203 --> 01:17:33,536
I'm so sorry, before we move on,

1089
01:17:33,538 --> 01:17:34,778
how do you two know each other?

1090
01:17:34,802 --> 01:17:36,040
Timon, Pumbaa...

1091
01:17:36,042 --> 01:17:37,974
I want you to meet
my best friend, Nala.

1092
01:17:37,976 --> 01:17:40,743
Best friend?
Well, that hurts.

1093
01:17:40,745 --> 01:17:42,478
Nala, you're gonna love it here!

1094
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:43,745
This place is amazing.

1095
01:17:43,747 --> 01:17:45,615
It's everything
you could ever want.

1096
01:17:45,617 --> 01:17:47,484
Simba, we need to leave.

1097
01:17:47,486 --> 01:17:50,954
Scar has taken over
with the hyenas.

1098
01:17:50,956 --> 01:17:53,890
You have to take
your place as king.

1099
01:17:53,892 --> 01:17:55,491
King? Simba?

1100
01:17:55,493 --> 01:17:57,959
We kneel before you
as loyal servants.

1101
01:17:57,961 --> 01:18:00,061
Pumbaa, relax.
She's wrong.

1102
01:18:00,063 --> 01:18:01,630
Lady, you've got
your lions crossed.

1103
01:18:01,632 --> 01:18:02,698
Nice.

1104
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:04,166
Seeing you again,

1105
01:18:04,168 --> 01:18:06,502
you don't know what this
will mean to everyone.

1106
01:18:06,504 --> 01:18:08,703
What this means to me.

1107
01:18:08,705 --> 01:18:10,838
You have to come home.

1108
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:13,009
This is my home.

1109

1155
01:21:31,161 --> 01:21:33,729
I told you.
Isn't it great here?

1156
01:21:33,731 --> 01:21:35,897
You know, maybe it could be
like this forever.

1157
01:21:35,899 --> 01:21:38,066
It's amazing.

1158
01:21:38,068 --> 01:21:41,301
But there's something
I don't understand.

1159
01:21:41,303 --> 01:21:43,938
If you've been alive
all this time...

1160
01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:46,006
why haven't you come home?

1161
01:21:46,008 --> 01:21:48,141
We've really needed you.

1162
01:21:48,143 --> 01:21:49,877
They're fine, all right?

1163
01:21:49,879 --> 01:21:51,378
Nobody needs me.

1164
01:21:51,380 --> 01:21:53,146
You're the king.

1165
01:21:53,148 --> 01:21:55,982
Nala, Scar is the king.

1166
01:21:55,984 --> 01:21:59,019
Simba, he's decimated
the Pride Lands.

1167
01:21:59,021 --> 01:22:00,987
There's no food, no water...

1168
01:22:00,989 --> 01:22:03,090
There's nothing I can do.

1169
01:22:03,092 --> 01:22:04,890
What about your mother?

1170
01:22:04,892 --> 01:22:07,027
This is your responsibility.

1171
01:22:07,029 --> 01:22:08,495
You need to challenge Scar.

1172
01:22:08,497 --> 01:22:11,497
I can't go back. Ever.

1173
01:22:11,499 --> 01:22:12,932
Why?

1174
01:22:12,934 --> 01:22:14,900
Because of what happened
at the gorge?

1175
01:22:14,902 --> 01:22:16,067
Scar told us that...

1176
01:22:16,069 --> 01:22:17,469
You wouldn't understand!

1177
01:22:17,471 --> 01:22:19,037
None of it matters. Okay?

1178
01:22:19,039 --> 01:22:20,740
Hakuna matata.

1179
01:22:20,742 --> 01:22:21,906
What?

1180
01:22:21,908 --> 01:22:23,468
It's something
I learned out here, okay?

1181
01:22:23,492 --> 01:22:25,244
You see,
sometimes bad things happen,

1182
01:22:25,246 --> 01:22:27,112
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

1183
01:22:27,114 --> 01:22:28,913
So, why worry?

1184
01:22:28,915 --> 01:22:30,949
Why worry?

1185
01:22:30,951 --> 01:22:32,984
What happened to you?

1186
01:22:32,986 --> 01:22:35,320
You're not the Simba I remember.

1187
01:22:35,322 --> 01:22:38,189
And I never will be.
Are you satisfied?

1188
01:22:38,191 --> 01:22:39,958
No, I'm disappointed.

1189
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:42,326
You know, now you're starting
to sound like my father.

1190
01:22:42,328 --> 01:22:45,529
Good. I'm glad
one of us does.

1191
01:22:45,531 --> 01:22:48,265
You have no idea
what I've been through!

1192
01:22:48,267 --> 01:22:51,171
I came here looking for help.

1193
01:22:52,871 --> 01:22:55,307
I guess I made a mistake.

1194
01:22:56,342 --> 01:22:58,178
Goodbye, Simba.

1195
01:23:14,825 --> 01:23:16,892
"Disappointed"?

1196
01:23:16,894 --> 01:23:19,059
She wants me to go home?

1197
01:23:19,061 --> 01:23:21,095
I am home.

1198
01:23:21,097 --> 01:23:23,197
"Best friend"?

1199
01:23:23,199 --> 01:23:26,134
I don't need best friends.
I don't need anybody.

1200
01:23:26,136 --> 01:23:27,739
Never did.

1201
01:23:54,262 --> 01:23:56,428
Go away.

1202
01:23:56,430 --> 01:23:59,265
Going away will not
answer the question.

1203
01:23:59,267 --> 01:24:02,267
What question?
Who are you?

1204
01:24:02,269 --> 01:24:04,368
I know exactly who I am.

1205
01:24:04,370 --> 01:24:07,573
The question is, who are you?

1206
01:24:07,575 --> 01:24:11,577
I'm nobody. So leave me alone.
All right?

1207
01:24:11,579 --> 01:24:16,113
Everybody is somebody.
Even a nobody.

1208
01:24:16,115 --> 01:24:18,152
Yeah, I think you're confused.

1209
01:24:19,085 --> 01:24:21,085
I am confused?

1210
01:24:21,087 --> 01:24:23,554
You don't even know who you are.

1211
01:24:23,556 --> 01:24:25,893
Oh. And I suppose
you do?

1212
01:24:27,894 --> 01:24:30,164
I held the son of Mufasa.

1213
01:24:32,265 --> 01:24:33,865
You knew my father?

1214
01:24:33,867 --> 01:24:34,965
Correction.

1215
01:24:34,967 --> 01:24:36,900
I know your father.

1216
01:24:36,902 --> 01:24:39,134
He died a long time ago.

1217
01:24:39,136 --> 01:24:41,170
He's alive!

1218
01:24:41,172 --> 01:24:43,306
And I can take you to him.

1219
01:24:43,308 --> 01:24:45,208
Follow me.
I will show you!

1220
01:24:45,210 --> 01:24:46,209
Whoa. Hey, hey, hey!

1221
01:24:46,211 --> 01:24:47,445
If you can keep up!

1222
01:24:48,113 --> 01:24:49,612
Wait!

1223
01:24:59,122 --> 01:25:01,155
Follow me!

1224
01:25:07,331 --> 01:25:09,934
Quickly, quickly!
Come through!

1225
01:25:13,937 --> 01:25:15,372
Hey! Slow down!

1226
01:25:17,941 --> 01:25:20,507
Hey, you better hurry.

1227
01:25:20,509 --> 01:25:23,446
Hold on.
I'm coming, I'm coming.

1228
01:25:43,498 --> 01:25:44,900
Come.

1229
01:25:54,374 --> 01:25:57,444
Your father is waiting.

1230
01:26:09,555 --> 01:26:11,458
Do you see him?

1231
01:26:12,491 --> 01:26:14,992
I don't see anything.

1232
01:26:16,996 --> 01:26:18,365
Look closer.

1233
01:26:23,568 --> 01:26:25,437
You see?

1234
01:26:26,438 --> 01:26:29,307
He lives in you.

1235
01:26:31,743 --> 01:26:33,408
Simba.

1236
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:41,684
Dad?

1237
01:26:41,686 --> 01:26:43,418
Simba.

1238
01:26:43,420 --> 01:26:48,458
You must take your place
in the circle of life.

1239
01:26:50,026 --> 01:26:51,292
I can't.

1240
01:26:51,294 --> 01:26:54,196
You must remember who you are.

1241
01:26:54,198 --> 01:26:56,732
The one true king.

1242
01:26:56,734 --> 01:26:57,968
I'm sorry.

1243
01:26:59,003 --> 01:27:01,468
I don't know how to be like you.

1244
01:27:01,470 --> 01:27:05,772
As king, I was most proud
of one thing.

1245
01:27:05,774 --> 01:27:08,478
Having you as my son.

1246
01:27:10,512 --> 01:27:13,214
That was a long time ago.

1247
01:27:13,216 --> 01:27:17,319
No, Simba. That is forever.

1248
01:27:20,188 --> 01:27:21,721
Please.

1249
01:27:21,723 --> 01:27:24,024
Don't leave me again.

1250
01:27:24,026 --> 01:27:26,159
I never left you.

1251
01:27:26,161 --> 01:27:28,397
And never will.

1252
01:27:29,531 --> 01:27:32,467
Remember who you are.

1253
01:27:34,701 --> 01:27:37,071
Remember.

1254
01:27:46,347 --> 01:27:49,247
And so, I ask again.

1255
01:27:49,249 --> 01:27:50,451
Who are you?

1256
01:27:52,752 --> 01:27:55,118
I am Simba.

1257
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:57,458

1266

So, what are you gonna do?

1276
01:29:52,264 --> 01:29:53,797
My father once
told me to protect

1277
01:29:53,799 --> 01:29:55,731
everything the light touches.

1278
01:29:55,733 --> 01:29:58,736
If I don't fight for it,
who will?

1279
01:30:00,205 --> 01:30:01,671
I will.

1280
01:30:01,673 --> 01:30:03,472
It's going to be dangerous.

1281
01:30:03,474 --> 01:30:05,507
Danger? Ha!

1282
01:30:05,509 --> 01:30:08,877
I laugh in the face of danger.

1283
01:30:11,282 --> 01:30:14,582
It can't be!

1284
01:30:14,584 --> 01:30:16,885
Hello, Zazu.

1285
01:30:16,887 --> 01:30:19,354
Your Majesty.

1286
01:30:19,356 --> 01:30:20,656
Welcome home.

1287
01:30:23,792 --> 01:30:24,792
We're here!

1288
01:30:24,794 --> 01:30:26,595
Oh, everyone, calm down.
We're here.

1289
01:30:26,597 --> 01:30:28,528
The backup has arrived!

1290
01:30:28,530 --> 01:30:30,231
What are you guys doing here?

1291
01:30:30,233 --> 01:30:33,567
Um, we were not worried!
Um... No, not worried.

1292
01:30:33,569 --> 01:30:35,402
'Cause no worries.
Nope. Hakuna matata.

1293
01:30:35,404 --> 01:30:37,571
We were concerned, because...

1294
01:30:37,573 --> 01:30:38,939
Because, you know...

1295
01:30:38,941 --> 01:30:40,008
You're our friend.

1296
01:30:40,010 --> 01:30:43,476
What about the meaningless
line of indifference?

1297
01:30:43,478 --> 01:30:44,945
Well, we were thinking...

1298
01:30:44,947 --> 01:30:47,246
maybe it curves a little bit.
That's a good point.

1299
01:30:47,248 --> 01:30:48,514
I mean, Simba, look,

1300
01:30:48,516 --> 01:30:50,482
I'm happy to admit
when Pumbaa's wrong...

1301
01:30:50,484 --> 01:30:51,618
and this is one of
those instances.

1302
01:30:51,620 --> 01:30:52,752
What? That wasn't
my thing.

1303
01:30:52,754 --> 01:30:54,221
You told me about the line.

1304
01:30:54,223 --> 01:30:55,521
Wait, hold on.

1305
01:30:55,523 --> 01:30:57,923
Now, this is the place
you're fighting for?

1306
01:30:57,925 --> 01:31:00,559
Yes, Timon.
This is my home.

1307
01:31:00,561 --> 01:31:02,828
Is it behind
that terrifying rock?

1308
01:31:02,830 --> 01:31:04,829
Talk about your fixer-upper.

1309
01:31:04,831 --> 01:31:06,498
I like what you've done with it,

1310
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:08,434
although a bit heavy
on the carcass.

1311
01:31:08,436 --> 01:31:10,301
Hey, hey, look.
A bird.

1312
01:31:10,303 --> 01:31:13,305
Timon, Pumbaa, this is Zazu.

1313
01:31:13,307 --> 01:31:15,340
Oh, wow!
It's a puffin.

1314
01:31:15,342 --> 01:31:16,710
Charming.

1315
01:31:18,410 --> 01:31:20,778
Simba, we are with you
until the end.

1316
01:31:20,780 --> 01:31:23,547
We are at your service,
my liege!

1317
01:31:23,549 --> 01:31:25,485
Follow me.

1318
01:31:39,530 --> 01:31:41,264
Hyenas everywhere.

1319
01:31:41,266 --> 01:31:42,532
I hope it's a quick death.

1320
01:31:42,534 --> 01:31:43,934
You know, just not
a lot of chewing.

1321
01:31:43,958 --> 01:31:45,301
What's your plan for getting us

1322
01:31:45,303 --> 01:31:46,902
past the slobbering guards?

1323
01:31:46,904 --> 01:31:48,906
Live bait.

1324
01:31:53,344 --> 01:31:54,809
That's a great idea.

1325
01:31:54,811 --> 01:31:57,312
Those guys could never
resist fresh meat.

1326
01:31:57,314 --> 01:32:00,548
So all we need to do is find
something that's, like, big...

1327
01:32:00,550 --> 01:32:02,684
and plump, and juicy.

1328
01:32:02,686 --> 01:32:04,921
Maybe like a gnu?

1329
01:32:05,988 --> 01:32:08,593
Why is everyone looking at me?

1330
01:32:13,929 --> 01:32:16,463
It is with deepest pride

1331
01:32:16,465 --> 01:32:18,600
and greatest pleasure...

1332
01:32:18,602 --> 01:32:21,969
that we proudly present...

1333
01:32:21,971 --> 01:32:23,706
your dinner.

1334
01:32:25,907 --> 01:32:29,842
♪ Be our guest ♪

1335
01:32:33,382 --> 01:32:35,851
It's working, Pumbaa!

1336
01:33:08,413 --> 01:33:11,382
My old friend.

1337
01:33:11,384 --> 01:33:13,817
Sarabi,
why put yourself through this?

1338
01:33:13,819 --> 01:33:16,587
All you have to do
is be my queen.

1339
01:33:16,589 --> 01:33:17,987
You're suffering for what?

1340
01:33:17,989 --> 01:33:20,357
The memory of a life
you once knew?

1341
01:33:20,359 --> 01:33:23,092
A king you once loved?

1342
01:33:23,094 --> 01:33:26,829
I tried to make you understand
what a true king can be.

1343
01:33:26,831 --> 01:33:31,700
Scar, a true king's power
is his compassion.

1344
01:33:31,702 --> 01:33:33,837
I am ten times
the king Mufasa was!

1345
01:33:33,839 --> 01:33:37,140
You are nothing
compared to Mufasa!

1346
01:33:47,951 --> 01:33:49,484
Mufasa?

1347
01:33:49,486 --> 01:33:50,719
It can't be.

1348
01:33:50,721 --> 01:33:52,991
Get away from my mother.

1349
01:33:55,557 --> 01:33:56,993
Simba.

1350
01:33:59,462 --> 01:34:01,562
You're alive?

1351
01:34:01,564 --> 01:34:03,930
How can that be?

1352
01:34:03,932 --> 01:34:06,433
I'm here, Mother.

1353
01:34:06,435 --> 01:34:07,535
I'm home.

1354
01:34:07,537 --> 01:34:09,002
Simba...

1355
01:34:09,004 --> 01:34:11,471
I'm so happy to see you.

1356
01:34:11,473 --> 01:34:12,672
Alive.

1357
01:34:13,876 --> 01:34:15,875
Give me one good reason

1358
01:34:15,877 --> 01:34:17,878
why I shouldn't rip you apart.

1359
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:20,179
I can give you more than one.

1360
01:34:20,181 --> 01:34:21,714
You see...

1361
01:34:21,716 --> 01:34:23,682
they think I'm king.

1362
01:34:25,854 --> 01:34:27,889
Well, we don't.

1363
01:34:28,889 --> 01:34:31,891
Your reign is over, Scar.

1364
01:34:31,893 --> 01:34:34,560
Simba is the rightful king!

1365
01:34:34,562 --> 01:34:38,530
If you wanna get him,
you have to get through us.

1366
01:34:38,532 --> 01:34:40,632
Are you with me, lions?

1367
01:34:43,803 --> 01:34:45,869
The choice is yours, Scar.

1368
01:34:45,871 --> 01:34:47,905
Step down or fight.

1369
01:34:47,907 --> 01:34:52,042
Must this all end in violence?

1370
01:34:52,044 --> 01:34:56,079
I'd hate to be responsible for
the death of a family member.

1371
01:34:56,081 --> 01:34:59,081
To feel the shame of knowing...

1372
01:34:59,083 --> 01:35:01,952
I took the life
of someone I love.

1373
01:35:01,954 --> 01:35:03,786
I put all that behind me.

1374
01:35:03,788 --> 01:35:06,989
But have they
put it behind them?

1375
01:35:06,991 --> 01:35:09,960
Do your faithful subjects
know what you've done?

1376
01:35:09,962 --> 01:35:11,627
What is he talking about?

1377
01:35:11,629 --> 01:35:15,531
So you haven't told them
your little secret?

1378
01:35:15,533 --> 01:35:18,000
Well, Simba...

1379
01:35:18,002 --> 01:35:21,204
now's your chance to confess.

1380
01:35:21,206 --> 01:35:24,976
Tell them who's responsible
for Mufasa's death.

1381
01:35:33,116 --> 01:35:35,217
It was me.

1382
01:35:35,219 --> 01:35:37,121
It's not true.

1383
01:35:37,987 --> 01:35:40,222
Tell me it's not true.

1384
01:35:40,224 --> 01:35:42,156
It's true. I'm sorry.

1385
01:35:42,158 --> 01:35:44,124
He admits it.

1386
01:35:44,126 --> 01:35:45,026
Murderer!

1387
01:35:45,028 --> 01:35:47,093
No, no.
It was an accident.

1388
01:35:47,095 --> 01:35:49,163
If it weren't for you
the king would be alive.

1389
01:35:49,165 --> 01:35:51,966
It's your fault he's dead!
Do you deny it?

1390
01:35:51,968 --> 01:35:53,734
I'm not a murderer.

1391
01:35:53,736 --> 01:35:55,896
We should believe a son who
takes the life of a father?

1392
01:35:55,920 --> 01:35:58,838
We should believe a son who
takes the life of a king?

1393
01:35:58,840 --> 01:36:01,275
A son who abandons his mother?

1394
01:36:01,277 --> 01:36:02,842
No. I'm...

1395
01:36:02,844 --> 01:36:05,879
You're what? Say it!
Are you the king?

1396
01:36:05,881 --> 01:36:07,113
No. No, I'm...

1397
01:36:07,115 --> 01:36:08,715
Are you the king?
No, I'm...

1398
01:36:08,717 --> 01:36:10,518
You're what? Say it!
I'm...

1399
01:36:11,919 --> 01:36:13,552
I'm nothing.

1400
01:36:13,554 --> 01:36:15,522
Then bow to your king!

1401
01:36:17,758 --> 01:36:18,992
Simba!

1402
01:36:34,542 --> 01:36:36,773
This looks familiar.

1403
01:36:36,775 --> 01:36:41,111
Where have I seen this before?

1404
01:36:41,113 --> 01:36:44,949
Oh, yes, I remember.

1405
01:36:44,951 --> 01:36:48,052
This is the way Mufasa
looked before he died.

1406
01:36:48,054 --> 01:36:51,588
I looked down...

1407
01:36:51,590 --> 01:36:54,290
saw the fear in his eyes.

1408
01:36:57,829 --> 01:37:01,030
And here's my little secret.

1409
01:37:01,032 --> 01:37:04,135
I killed Mufasa.

1410
01:37:10,740 --> 01:37:13,511
No!

1411
01:37:18,281 --> 01:37:19,681
My father!

1412
01:37:19,683 --> 01:37:20,748
Your own brother!

1413
01:37:20,750 --> 01:37:22,016
How could you?

1414
01:37:22,018 --> 01:37:24,051
First he kills Mufasa...

1415
01:37:24,053 --> 01:37:25,819
and now he wants to kill me!

1416
01:37:25,821 --> 01:37:27,054
You killed him!

1417
01:37:27,056 --> 01:37:28,689
Tell them the truth!

1418
01:37:28,691 --> 01:37:30,325
Don't believe his lies!

1419
01:37:30,327 --> 01:37:31,393
Scar...

1420
01:37:31,395 --> 01:37:35,330
you told us you didn't get
to the gorge in time.

1421
01:37:35,332 --> 01:37:36,364
That's true!

1422
01:37:36,366 --> 01:37:40,069
Then how did you see
the look in Mufasa's eyes?

1423
01:37:41,804 --> 01:37:43,769
Murderer!

1424
01:37:43,771 --> 01:37:45,104
Kill them all!

1425
01:37:51,947 --> 01:37:53,347
Lions, attack!

1426
01:38:08,395 --> 01:38:10,197
Simba!

1427
01:38:15,802 --> 01:38:17,034
Pumbaa, I think we lost them.

1428
01:38:17,036 --> 01:38:18,802
That was terrifying.

1429
01:38:19,973 --> 01:38:22,306
Do you hear a low growl?

1430
01:38:22,308 --> 01:38:25,142
Looks like we'll be
having pig for dinner.

1431
01:38:25,144 --> 01:38:27,845
Plump and chubby.

1432
01:38:27,847 --> 01:38:29,145
Chubby?

1433
01:38:29,147 --> 01:38:30,381
Did he just call me chubby?

1434
01:38:30,383 --> 01:38:31,381
Uh-oh.

1435
01:38:31,383 --> 01:38:34,083
It sounded a lot like
he just said "chubby".

1436
01:38:34,085 --> 01:38:36,053
Which would be
a mistake because...

1437
01:38:36,055 --> 01:38:38,421
I will not be made to feel
ashamed of who I am!

1438
01:38:38,423 --> 01:38:39,689
Oh, boy.

1439
01:38:39,691 --> 01:38:41,324
I may run from hyenas...

1440
01:38:41,326 --> 01:38:44,126
but I will always fight a bully!

1441
01:38:52,102 --> 01:38:53,402
You feel better, Pumbaa?
I do.

1442
01:38:53,404 --> 01:38:54,836
You got that out of your system?

1443
01:38:54,838 --> 01:38:56,272
I did.

1444
01:39:09,987 --> 01:39:14,423
Now, this is a meal I've
waited my whole life for.

1445
01:39:14,425 --> 01:39:16,923
I've been waiting too.

1446
01:39:16,925 --> 01:39:19,062
And I'm not a cub anymore!

1447
01:39:24,032 --> 01:39:26,303
For king and country!

1448
01:39:28,905 --> 01:39:30,037
It's the bird!

1449
01:39:30,039 --> 01:39:31,641
I got him! I got him!

1450
01:39:33,008 --> 01:39:34,306
Tally-ho!

1451
01:39:34,308 --> 01:39:35,774
Oh! No! He's got me!

1452
01:39:35,776 --> 01:39:37,045
He's got me! Ooh!

1453
01:39:39,815 --> 01:39:41,416
Get that bird!

1454
01:39:46,221 --> 01:39:48,720
Please! Let's discuss this.

1455
01:40:21,053 --> 01:40:23,022
That never gets old!

1456
01:41:35,089 --> 01:41:36,390
It's over, Scar.

1457
01:41:40,259 --> 01:41:42,026
Have mercy.
I beg you.

1458
01:41:42,028 --> 01:41:43,561
Mercy?

1459
01:41:43,563 --> 01:41:45,262
After what you did?

1460
01:41:45,264 --> 01:41:47,231
It was the hyenas.

1461
01:41:47,233 --> 01:41:49,568
Those revolting scavengers
made me do it.

1462
01:41:49,570 --> 01:41:52,070
I was planning
on killing them all.

1463
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:55,506
You fooled the hyenas.

1464
01:41:55,508 --> 01:41:57,410
Just like you fooled me.

1465
01:42:00,245 --> 01:42:01,545
Simba...

1466
01:42:01,547 --> 01:42:04,151
you wouldn't kill
your only uncle.

1467
01:42:05,618 --> 01:42:06,887
No, Scar.

1468
01:42:08,420 --> 01:42:10,257
I'm not like you.

1469
01:42:11,021 --> 01:42:12,956
Oh, Simba...

1470
01:42:12,958 --> 01:42:15,258
you are truly noble.

1471
01:42:15,260 --> 01:42:17,160
And I will make it up to you.

1472
01:42:17,162 --> 01:42:20,196
Just tell me
how I can prove myself.

1473
01:42:20,198 --> 01:42:22,935
Tell me what you want me to do.

1474
01:42:25,102 --> 01:42:26,437
Run.

1475
01:42:28,905 --> 01:42:31,306
Run away, Scar.

1476
01:42:31,308 --> 01:42:34,546
Run away and never return.

1477
01:42:36,113 --> 01:42:37,482
Yes.

1478
01:42:38,181 --> 01:42:40,350
Of course.

1479
01:42:41,018 --> 01:42:43,250
As you wish...

1480
01:42:43,252 --> 01:42:44,918
Your Majesty.

1481
01:42:44,920 --> 01:42:46,189
Aah!

1482
01:42:57,233 --> 01:42:58,998
You can't win, Scar!

1483
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:00,566
This is my kingdom!

1484
01:43:00,568 --> 01:43:01,937
My destiny!

1485
01:43:55,086 --> 01:43:56,386
My friends.

1486
01:43:56,388 --> 01:43:57,687
It will take some time,

1487
01:43:57,689 --> 01:44:00,456
but together
we will build our army.

1488
01:44:00,458 --> 01:44:02,225
"Friends", huh?

1489
01:44:02,227 --> 01:44:06,261
I thought you said we were
"revolting scavengers"?

1490
01:44:06,263 --> 01:44:09,498
Yeah. That you wanted
to kill us?

1491
01:44:09,500 --> 01:44:10,399
No.

1492
01:44:10,401 --> 01:44:12,301
No, let me explain.

1493
01:44:12,303 --> 01:44:15,037
I was trying to fool him.

1494
01:44:15,039 --> 01:44:17,506
We will rule together!

1495
01:44:17,508 --> 01:44:20,911
There's only one true thing
you ever said, Scar.

1496
01:44:23,112 --> 01:44:25,246
"A hyena's belly...

1497
01:44:25,248 --> 01:44:27,215
"is never full."

1498
01:44:33,190 --> 01:44:34,423
No!

1499
01:45:27,306 --> 01:45:29,476
