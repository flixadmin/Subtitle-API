1
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,077
Katie!

2
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,246
Cora!

3
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,039
You love your sister?

4
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,792
You make any noise,
you know what happens.

5
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,757
Good morning, Estelle.

6
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:57,635
-How am I looking, Paul?
-That's better. That's better.

7
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,528
Morning, Mr. Edgecomb.

8
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:16,988
Some Danish this morning?

9
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,408
No, just two pieces of dry toast,
Hector. Thanks.

10
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:21,951
Leftover's fine.

11
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,622
-Dry and cold, same as always.
-Cold is better.

12
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,123
Hmm.

13
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,125
Especially on those long walks.

14
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:31,753
Am I right?

15
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:36,800
Don't let Nurse Godzilla catch you.
She'll raise holy hell.

16
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:39,094
We're not supposed to let you
wander off.

17
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:46,309
Where do you go every day?
What do you do up in those hills?

18
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,395
Just walk.

19
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,563
I like to walk.

20
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,068
You try not to fall down, bust a hip.

21
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:58,363
I don't wanna be in
no damn search party.

22
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:10,059
You want this man
constantly in your life?

23
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,228
Explain the moral basis of that.

24
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:13,521
I've made mistakes.

25
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,940
Tony doesn't admit that
he's not a good father.

26
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:19,986
She can't ask nothing. You can't
ask nothing. I have six kids myself.

27
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,698
Why do we always watch this stuff?

28
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:25,909
It's interesting.

29
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:31,289
Interesting?
Bunch of inbred trailer trash?

30
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:34,083
All they ever talk about is fucking.

31
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,085
...ain't no way in this green earth...

32
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,587
<i>...I'd have a father like that.</i>

33
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:42,467
If what you saying is true--
No, I'm talking now. I'm talking now.

34
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:44,052
What kind of a mother are you?

35
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:45,762
One that causes people more--

36
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:48,348
is going to let you try the bodystrider--

37
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,266
You're dead! You can't come back!

38
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:53,770
It's back. The Popeil Pocket Fisherman.

39
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,855
Take my husband, take my kids...

40
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:59,025
-Are you all right?
-Hmm?

41
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,694
You look tired. You're not yourself.

42
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,572
No, I'm fine. I promise.

43
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:08,660
You're wearing yourself out
with those walks every day, I think.

44
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,787
Not that you asked me.

45
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,957
I just didn't sleep well, is all.

46
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:18,294
I had a few bad dreams. It happens.

47
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,129
I'll be fine.

48
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,307
If Madge doesn't care,
I certainly don't.

49
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,642
Neither do I.

50
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,478
Now, this here is worth a look.

51
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:39,190
<i>I'm in heaven</i>

52
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:46,155
<i>And my heart beats so
That I can hardly speak</i>

53
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,741
<i>And I seem to find</i>

54
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:52,662
<i>The happiness I seek</i>

55
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:59,335
<i>When we're out together
Dancing cheek to cheek</i>

56
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,171
<i>Heaven</i>

57
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:05,216
<i>I'm in heaven</i>

58
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,761
<i>And the cares that hung around me</i>

59
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,764
<i>Through the week</i>

60
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:13,725
<i>Seem to vanish</i>

61
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:17,020
<i>Like a gambler's lucky streak</i>

62
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:22,358
Paul, what is it?

63
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,195
My God.

64
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,745
I've got to get out of here.

65
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:59,228
I guess sometimes the past
just catches up with you...

66
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:02,523
...whether you want it to or not.
It's silly.

67
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:06,235
Was it the film? It was, wasn't it?

68
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:11,908
I haven't spoken of these things
for a long time, Ellie.

69
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,534
Over 60 years.

70
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,537
Paul, I'm your friend.

71
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:24,837
I ever tell you that I was a prison guard
during the Depression?

72
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,923
You've mentioned it.

73
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:30,259
Did I mention that I was
in charge of death row?

74
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,720
That I supervised all the executions?

75
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:41,813
Usually, death row is called
"The Last Mile."

76
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:44,607
We called ours "The Green Mile."

77
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:48,361
The floor was the color
of faded limes.

78
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,864
We had the electric chair.

79
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,117
"Old Sparky," we called it.

80
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:59,330
Oh, I've lived a lot of years, Ellie...

81
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:03,960
...but 1935, that takes the prize.

82
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,130
That year, I had...

83
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:10,550
...the worst urinary infection
of my life.

84
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,678
It was...

85
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,973
It was also the year of...

86
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:19,684
...John Coffey...

87
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,271
...and the two dead girls.

88
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,077
All right, now, hold on!

89
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,209
Up on the tower!

90
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,710
New prisoner's coming in!

91
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:30,838
You men down in the yard,
step off the fence! Clear that gate!

92
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,889
Put me through to E Block.

93
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,279
E Block.

94
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,073
Yeah.

95
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:58,741
Right.

96
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,339
Oh.

97
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,181
Paul? Prisoner.

98
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,975
Christ, give me a minute.

99
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:30,773
You all right in there?

100
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:38,364
For a man pissing razorblades, yeah.
Ahh...

101
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:54,297
You should've took the day off
to see the doctor.

102
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:57,216
With a new arrival?
You know better.

103
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,302
Besides...

104
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:03,306
...it's not as bad as it was.
I think it's clearing up.

105
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,269
-All right. Let's look alive, Dean.
-Yes, sir.

106
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:16,861
Damn.

107
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,156
They're riding on the axle.

108
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,208
What'd they do?

109
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,210
They bust the springs?

110
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:39,759
Ho...

111
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,512
Dead man!

112
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,973
Dead man walking!

113
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:49,685
-Who--?
-We got a dead man walking here!

114
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,022
Jesus, please us,
what is he yelling about?

115
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,526
Paul...

116
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:01,155
...you might reconsider getting
in the cell with this guy.

117
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:02,782
He's enormous.

118
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,951
Can't be bigger than you.

119
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:16,754
Dead man!

120
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,090
Dead man walking!

121
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,758
Dead man!

122
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,510
Dead man walking!

123
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:25,680
Dead man walking here!

124
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,224
Dead man!

125
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,772
We got a dead man walking here!

126
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,565
Dead man walking!

127
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:42,154
-We got a dead man walking here!
-Percy.

128
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,115
That's enough.

129
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:09,765
Am I gonna have any trouble
with you, big boy?

130
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:15,938
Can you talk?

131
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:25,489
Yes, sir, boss. I can talk.

132
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:36,625
Move your ass. Let's go.

133
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,502
Come on.

134
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,676
Percy...

135
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,929
...they're moving house
down in the infirmary.

136
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:52,433
Why don't you go see
if they could use some help.

137
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,810
They got all the men they need.

138
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,146
Why don't you just go
and make sure.

139
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,192
-Uh-uh.
-I don't care where you go...

140
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:03,652
...as long as it's not here
at this very moment.

141
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,241
All right.

142
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,337
Ow!

143
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,507
God, you bust my finger.

144
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:27,093
I wiped that grin off your face,
didn't I?

145
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:30,721
Goddamn it, Percy,
get the hell off my block!

146
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,061
Uh-huh.

147
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:43,692
Fuck you, Percy.

148
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:47,154
We'll get that looked at, Del.
In the meantime, you stay quiet.

149
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:50,241
Yeah. Yeah.

150
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:56,497
I let Harry take those chains off you...

151
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,332
...you gonna be nice?

152
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,017
Your name is John Coffey.

153
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,019
Yes, sir, boss.

154
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:22,731
Like the drink,
only not spelt the same.

155
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,525
Oh, you can spell, can you?

156
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:28,112
Just my name, boss.

157
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:31,240
J-O--

158
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,576
My name is Paul Edgecomb.

159
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:37,288
If I'm not here, you can
ask for Mr. Terwilliger...

160
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:40,583
...Mr. Howell or Mr. Stanton.
These gentlemen right there.

161
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,253
Questions?

162
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,423
Do you leave the light on
after bedtime?

163
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:53,596
Because I get a little scared
in the dark sometime...

164
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,891
...if it's a strange place.

165
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:05,774
It stays pretty bright around here
all night long.

166
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:08,569
We always keep a few lights burning
out in the corridor.

167
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:11,655
The corridor?

168
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,658
Right out there.

169
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:44,396
You can sit.

170
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:09,046
I couldn't help it, boss.

171
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:12,716
I tried to take it back,
but it was too late.

172
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:22,184
Dean, take Delacroix to the infirmary,
see if those fingers are broken.

173
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,852
-Yes, sir.
-Of course they're broken.

174
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,729
I heard the bones crack.

175
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,732
You hear what he was yelling
when we brought the dummy in?

176
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,985
How could I miss it?
The whole prison heard.

177
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:33,028
Goddamn Percy.

178
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:36,699
You'll have to answer
for sending him off the Mile.

179
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,868
I'll chew that food when I have to.

180
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,540
Right now I wanna hear about this new
inmate. Aside from how big he is, okay?

181
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,418
Monstrous big. Damn.

182
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,628
Oh, he seems meek enough.

183
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,588
-Is he retarded, you figure?
-Mm-hmm.

184
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,717
Looks like they sent us
an imbecile to execute.

185
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:58,220
Imbecile or not,
he deserves to fry for what he done.

186
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:03,809
Make your blood curdle.

187
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:31,754
-What?! For God's sake, what?
-The girls! The girls are gone!

188
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:35,424
Papa! Papa, look! There's blood.

189
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,597
Oh, my God.

190
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:50,856
Goddamn it, woman! Get on that phone
now. You tell them we headed west.

191
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:54,151
You mind what I'm saying!
We headed west!

192
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,779
Central! Are you on the line?

193
00:19:56,987 --> 00:20:01,158
Oh, God, please.
Somebody took my little girls.

194
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,296
Katie!

195
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,840
Cora!

196
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:49,415
Jesus.

197
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,875
Jesus.

198
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:04,138
I'll kill you!

199
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:09,560
I'll kill you!

200
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,048
I couldn't help it.

201
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:44,678
I tried to take it back,
but it was too late.

202
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:51,101
Boy, you under arrest for murder.

203
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,063
I interrupt?

204
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:59,276
Well, I'm just about done.

205
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,412
Hey...

206
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,540
...how's that pretty gal of yours?

207
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,752
Melinda's not so well, Paul.

208
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,712
Not so well at all.

209
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:21,924
More headaches?

210
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:25,135
Got laid up
with another one yesterday.

211
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,221
Worst one yet.

212
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:31,892
I'll be taking her over to Vicksburg
next day or so for some tests.

213
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,646
Head x-rays
and who knows what else.

214
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,607
She is scared to death.

215
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,694
Truth to tell, so am I.

216
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:46,823
If it's something they can see
on the x-ray...

217
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,284
...maybe it's something they can fix.

218
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:51,828
Maybe.

219
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,709
This just came in.

220
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,295
DOE on Bitterbuck.

221
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:05,801
You didn't come all the way down here
to hand me a DOE.

222
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:11,265
I had an angry call from
the state capitol about 20 minutes ago.

223
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:13,809
Is it true you ordered Percy Wetmore
off the block?

224
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:15,310
It is.

225
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:19,731
Now, I'm sure you had reason, Paul...

226
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,735
...but like it or not, the wife
of the governor has only one nephew...

227
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,821
...and his name is Percy Wetmore.

228
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,948
Little Percy calls his aunt...

229
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:31,660
...and squeals like a schoolroom sissy.

230
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:37,374
He also mention he assaulted a prisoner
this morning out of sheer petulance?

231
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:40,335
Broke three fingers
on Eduard Delacroix's left hand.

232
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,171
I didn't hear that part.
I'm sure she didn't either.

233
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:45,257
The man is mean and careless
and stupid...

234
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:48,343
...and that's a bad combination
in a place like this.

235
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,013
Sooner or later, he'll get
somebody hurt or worse.

236
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:52,556
Stick with it, Paul.

237
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,516
It may not be much longer.

238
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:59,313
I have it on good authority that Percy
has an application in at Briar Ridge.

239
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:02,024
Briar Ridge? The mental hospital.

240
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,567
Administration job.

241
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,277
Better pay.

242
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:06,737
Hmm.

243
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:08,989
Then why is he still here?

244
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:13,201
He could get that application
pushed through.

245
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:18,707
Hell, with his connections, he could
have any state job he wants.

246
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,168
You know what I think?

247
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:26,757
I think he just wants
to see one cook up close.

248
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:33,722
Well, he'll get his chance, then.
Won't he?

249
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:38,727
Maybe then he'll be satisfied
and move on. In the meantime...

250
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:42,230
-...you'll keep the peace?
-Of course.

251
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:44,858
Of course.

252
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,903
Thank you, Paul.

253
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,408
Hal...

254
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:56,453
...you give Melinda my love, okay?

255
00:24:56,953 --> 00:25:01,208
I'm sure that x-ray will turn out
to be nothing at all.

256
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:03,794
You bet.

257
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,239
Paul.

258
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:34,157
-Hey, you.
-Hey.

259
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:36,243
The music too loud?

260
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,161
No.

261
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:41,915
There's just this empty spot in the bed
where my husband usually sleeps.

262
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:48,130
He said to tell you he's having
a little trouble with that tonight.

263
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:53,760
Worried about Melinda and Hal?

264
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:56,930
Is that what's got you up?

265
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:59,141
Yeah, that...

266
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:01,935
...and things.

267
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,479
Things.

268
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:12,070
We got a new inmate today.

269
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,698
Simple-minded fella.

270
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:18,243
Do I wanna know what he did?

271
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:20,954
-No.
-Mmm.

272
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,332
Things that happen in this world.

273
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,794
It's a wonder God allows it.

274
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:34,050
Why don't you come to bed.

275
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:38,013
I think I have something
that'll help you sleep.

276
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:41,516
You can have all you want.

277
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:45,145
I still got something wrong
with my waterworks.

278
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:47,355
I don't wanna pass it on to you.

279
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:50,484
-Have you seen Doc Bishop yet?
-No.

280
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,569
Paul.

281
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:55,405
He'll just want me
to take sulfa tablets...

282
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:58,074
...and I'll spend the week
puking in my office.

283
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:02,370
It will run its course all by itself.
Thank you very much for your concern.

284
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:06,708
Poor old guy.

285
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,504
-Hmm.

286
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:23,725
Paul. Dean.

287
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:29,439
Yeah?

288
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,191
Come here. Go on.

289
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:37,239
I guess the legislature loosened
up the purse strings enough...

290
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:38,907
...10 hire on a new guard.

291
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:48,875
Look again.

292
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:50,585
He's right...

293
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,295
...there.

294
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:04,057
It ain't normal for a mouse
to come up on people this way.

295
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:07,143
-Maybe it's rabid.
-Oh, my Christ.

296
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:10,146
-Yeah, it could be.
-Oh, the big mouse expert.

297
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,524
The Mouse Man.

298
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:15,652
You see him foaming at the mouth,
Mouse Man?

299
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:18,071
I don't see its mouth at all.

300
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:31,501
-Brutal, no. We'll be hip-deep in mice.
-I just wanna see what he'll do.

301
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,087
In the interest of science, like.

302
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:16,504
He's in the damn restraint room.

303
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:19,174
And you just know he's chewing
the padding out of the walls...

304
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:21,343
...making himself a nice little nest.

305
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:28,183
All right.

306
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:31,019
Let's go get the damn mouse.

307
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,324
Boss.

308
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:46,326
Saw me a mouse go by.

309
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,703
Can't put anything over on you.

310
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:03,843
Just watch your toes. Watch your toes.

311
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,905
You let him get past you.

312
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:26,533
No, I did not.
I been here all the time.

313
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:28,576
Then where the hell is he?

314
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:30,245
Well, I don't know.

315
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:34,582
Three grown men...

316
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,919
...outsmarted by a mouse.

317
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:45,260
Well, bright side is, all this commotion
probably scared him off for good.

318
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:47,762
Yeah, yeah.

319
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:50,765
Yeah, that's the last
we'll see of him.

320
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:44,819
You little son of a bitch.

321
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,323
Well, I'll be damned.

322
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:53,411
There he is, big as Billy-be-frigged.
I thought Brutal was pulling my leg.

323
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,331
-That's a goddamn mouse.
-Yeah.

324
00:31:57,373 --> 00:32:00,502
Brute said he was in here last night...

325
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:02,295
...begging for food.

326
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,964
He come right on up to the desk.

327
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,926
-Give him some room, Percy.
-Huh?

328
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:10,345
-See what he does.
-All right.

329
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:25,193
He's a brave little bastard.
Gotta give him that.

330
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:55,181
Goddamn!

331
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:58,768
You little scurvy! Damn!

332
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:01,938
Percy, are you crazy,
you little son of a bitch?!

333
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,232
I'm gonna kill you!

334
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:09,070
-I'm gonna take you out!
-Percy! Percy!

335
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:12,740
You little vermin!
I'm gonna stomp your life out!

336
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:14,951
It's just a little mouse, dumb merde.

337
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,911
You ugly little piece of sh--

338
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:19,789
-Are you listening to me?
-Fuck!

339
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:23,751
-Percy!
-I'm gonna rip your diseased head off...

340
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:25,378
...you little piece of shit!

341
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:30,425
-Get on out of there!
-I want you to stop this!

342
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:40,435
-Hey, boss!
-What's going on?

343
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,651
Percy met your mouse.

344
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:55,533
It's in here somewhere. I'm gonna
squish the little son of a bitch.

345
00:33:57,911 --> 00:34:00,330
Percy, we already tried that.

346
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:03,541
Huh?

347
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,293
What'd you say?

348
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,961
I said that we--

349
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,968
Knock yourself out.
Hope you nail the bastard.

350
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:16,888
Oh, yeah.

351
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,152
Gosh. He ain't in there, huh?

352
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:34,489
Don't that beat the mousy band?

353
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,701
Percy...

354
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:42,664
...you wanna think about
what you were doing just now?

355
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:46,501
I was trying to get the mouse.
Are you blind?

356
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:50,171
You also scared the living crap
out of me and Bill...

357
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,006
...not to mention the inmates.

358
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:53,591
So what?

359
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,345
They aren't in cradle school,
in case you didn't notice.

360
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,973
Although you treat them that way.

361
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:03,351
We don't scare them
any more than we have to, Percy.

362
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:07,480
-They're under enough strain as it is.
-Men under strain can snap.

363
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:11,192
Hurt themselves and hurt others.
That's why our job is...

364
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,611
...talking...

365
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:15,863
...not yelling.

366
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:19,993
You'd do better to think of this place
like an intensive care ward of a hospital.

367
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:23,705
I think of it as a bucket of piss
to drown rats in.

368
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,581
That's all.

369
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,668
Anybody doesn't like it? Hmm?

370
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:31,087
You can kiss my ass.

371
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,173
Don't. Yeah, you try it. Go on.

372
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:38,052
Try it. You'll be on the bread lines
before the week is out.

373
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:39,887
Okay, Brutal.

374
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:54,610
We all know who
your connections are.

375
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:59,240
You ever threaten a man on this block
again, we all gonna have a go.

376
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,034
Job be damned.

377
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,079
You done?

378
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:12,337
Get all this shit back in the room.
You are cluttering up my Mile.

379
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:35,943
Arlen...

380
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:38,446
...your daughter and her family
are here.

381
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:48,956
Let's move. I want at least two
rehearsals before he gets back.

382
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:54,462
Sitting down, sitting down!

383
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,339
Rehearsing now. Everybody settle!

384
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,466
Arlen Bitterbuck, step forward.

385
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:02,303
Stepping forward, stepping forward,
stepping forward.

386
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:05,807
-Is his head properly shaved?
-Nope. It's all dandruffy, and it smells.

387
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:09,018
I will take that as a yes.
Let's go, Arlen.

388
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:12,897
Walking the Mile, walking the Mile...

389
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:17,443
...walking the Mile, walking the Mile,
walking the Mile...

390
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:18,986
...walking the Mile.

391
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:22,240
I'm getting to my knees.
I'm praying, praying.

392
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:25,159
Lord is my shepherd
and so forth and so on.

393
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:29,831
I'm sorry for all the bad shit
I've done and people I've tramped on.

394
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:32,500
And I hope they forgive me...

395
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:35,503
...and I'll never do it again,
that's for sure.

396
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:39,549
Paul, we're not gonna have some
Cherokee medicine man in here...

397
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,717
...hollering and shaking his dick,
are we?

398
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:44,512
-Well, actually--
-Still praying, still praying.

399
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:48,516
-Getting right with Jesus.
-Do it quietly! You old gink!

400
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:52,770
As I was saying, I don't believe
they actually shake their dicks.

401
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:56,482
Mr. Bitterbuck is a Christian,
so Reverend Schuster's coming in.

402
00:37:56,691 --> 00:38:00,194
He's good. He's fast too.
Doesn't get them all worked-up.

403
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:03,281
On your feet. Come on, Toot.
You prayed enough for one day.

404
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:06,242
Getting to my feet!
Walking the Mile...

405
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:09,787
...walking the Mile,
walking the Green Mile.

406
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,873
Walking the Mile.

407
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,791
Walking in the Mile.

408
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:16,711
Sitting down now.

409
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,756
Sitting down.
I'm taking a seat in Old Sparky.

410
00:38:21,174 --> 00:38:22,216
What do I do?

411
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:26,554
-Watch and learn.
-Watch and learn.

412
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,269
Getting strapped.

413
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:36,063
Getting clamped.

414
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:39,400
Getting wired.

415
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:42,570
All right.

416
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:45,907
Getting all electrode.

417
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:52,705
Roll on one.

418
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:56,584
"Roll on one" means I turn
the generator up full.

419
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,961
The lights go brighter
in half the prison.

420
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,922
Arlen Bitterbuck...

421
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:03,758
...you've been condemned to die
by a jury...

422
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:07,136
...sentence imposed by a judge
in good standing in this state.

423
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:10,139
Anything to say before
your sentence is carried out?

424
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:11,807
Yeah.

425
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:16,938
I want fried chicken with gravy on the
taters, and I want to shit in your hat.

426
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:22,485
I got to have Mae West sit on my face
because I'm one horny motherfucker.

427
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:28,157
You bastard.

428
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:30,785
That's a good one.

429
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:32,370
Quiet.

430
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:33,913
Quiet! Shut up!

431
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:36,624
-Shut up!
-Sorry, boss.

432
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:40,962
Toot, one more remark like that,
I'll have Van Hay roll on two for real.

433
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,673
And I'll have one less
crazy old trustee.

434
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,841
It was pretty funny.

435
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,636
That's why I don't like it.
We'll be doing this for real.

436
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:53,432
I don't want anybody remembering
a stupid joke and getting going again.

437
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,142
Ever try not to laugh in church

438
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:58,104
when something funny gets stuck in your head?
It's the same thing.

439
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:01,190
I'm sorry, Paul. You're right.

440
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:03,025
Let's keep going.

441
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,610
Harry.

442
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,616
Soak the sponge.

443
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:15,871
Putting on the black hood.

444
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,376
And putting on my cap.

445
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:22,628
Why's he putting that sponge
on his head?

446
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,798
Conducts electricity to the brain
fast like a bullet.

447
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:30,011
You don't ever throw the switch
on a man without that.

448
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,765
Hush up there, Toot.

449
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:39,687
Getting screwed.

450
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:42,565
I'm getting the cap.

451
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:48,195
Arlen Bitterbuck...

452
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:51,782
...electricity shall be passed through
your body until you are dead...

453
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:54,243
...in accordance with state law.

454
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:57,038
God have mercy on your soul.

455
00:40:58,372 --> 00:40:59,790
Amen.

456
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:03,336
Roll on two.

457
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:08,883
And that's that.

458
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:15,222
I'm frying! I'm frying!

459
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:20,061
I'm a done tom turkey!

460
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:24,607
This is a shocking experience!

461
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:28,402
One of the witnesses
showed up a day early.

462
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:38,120
Let's do it again,
and let's get it right this time.

463
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,748
Get that idiot out of the chair.

464
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:45,479
Do you think if a man sincerely
repents on what he done wrong...

465
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,984
...that he might get to go back to
the time that was happiest for him...

466
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:52,361
...and live there forever?

467
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,824
Could that be what heaven's like?

468
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,828
I just about believe that very thing.

469
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:05,583
Hmm.

470
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:10,171
Had me a young wife when I was 18.

471
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:15,509
Spent our first summer in the mountains.
Made love every night.

472
00:43:16,177 --> 00:43:19,305
And she'd lie there after...

473
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:22,600
...bare-breasted in the firelight.

474
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:27,062
And we'd talk sometimes
till the sun come up.

475
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:32,610
That was my best time.

476
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,298
It'll be fine.

477
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:57,218
You'll do fine.

478
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:34,547
Arlen Bitterbuck...

479
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:37,049
...electricity shall now be passed
through your body...

480
00:44:37,258 --> 00:44:41,303
...until you are dead,
in accordance with state law.

481
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:43,931
God have mercy on your soul.

482
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:04,827
Roll on two.

483
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:51,165
Again.

484
00:45:57,338 --> 00:45:59,048
Adios, chief.

485
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:04,011
Drop us a card from hell.
Let us know if it's hot enough.

486
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:08,766
He's paid what he owed.

487
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:11,477
He's square with the house again...

488
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:14,355
...So keep your goddamn hands
off him.

489
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:36,377
What's up his ass?

490
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,878
You.

491
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:41,465
Always. You, Percy.

492
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:45,219
You gotta hate the new boy?
That the way it is around here?

493
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:50,516
Why don't you just move on?
Take that job at Briar Ridge?

494
00:46:51,392 --> 00:46:53,894
Oh, yeah. I know all about it.

495
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:57,690
Sounds to me like a pretty good job.

496
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:02,528
I might just take it too,
soon as you put me out front.

497
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,072
Yeah, you heard me.

498
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:08,283
I want Brutal's spot
for the next execution.

499
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:16,125
Seeing a man die, that's not enough.
You gotta smell his nuts cook.

500
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,752
I just wanna be out front, is all.

501
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:22,047
Come on. One time.

502
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:24,758
And then you know what?

503
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:27,886
You'll be rid of me. I swear.

504
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:29,930
And if I say no?

505
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:34,601
Well, I might just stick around
for good.

506
00:47:35,436 --> 00:47:37,312
Make me a career of this...

507
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:39,940
...boss.

508
00:48:32,785 --> 00:48:34,995
You are not gonna believe this.

509
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:45,881
Look.

510
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:50,010
I done tame me that mouse.

511
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:52,387
We see that.

512
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:57,434
Ooh, ooh. Watch this.
Watch what he do.

513
00:49:04,525 --> 00:49:06,443
Ain't he something, now?

514
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:09,655
He's smart, Mr. Jingles.

515
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:12,032
-Mr. Jingles?
-That his name.

516
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:14,576
He whispered in my ear.

517
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:16,203
Hey, captain...

518
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:20,040
...could I have a box for my mouse
so he can sleep in here with me?

519
00:49:20,249 --> 00:49:22,918
Your English gets better
when you want something.

520
00:49:23,127 --> 00:49:25,045
Wanna see what else he can do?

521
00:49:26,547 --> 00:49:28,048
Watch, watch.

522
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:31,260
Mr. Jingle? Mr. Jingle,
wanna play fetch?

523
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:32,553
Wanna play fetch?

524
00:49:34,263 --> 00:49:36,181
Play fetch. Watch, watch.

525
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:58,912
He fetch it every time. Every time.

526
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:03,750
That's some smart mouse, Del.
Like he a circus mouse or something.

527
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:09,131
Correct. That just what he is too.
He's a circus mouse.

528
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:11,383
When I get out,
he'll make me rich.

529
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:14,094
You just watch and see
if he don't do that.

530
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:16,597
Play fetch? We play fetch again?

531
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:19,099
Well, well, well.

532
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:21,768
Looks like you found yourself
a new friend.

533
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:23,770
Don't hurt him.

534
00:50:25,314 --> 00:50:27,774
-Okay?
-Is that the one I chased?

535
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,818
Yeah, that's the one.

536
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:33,614
Only Del says his name is Mr. Jingles.

537
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:35,741
Is that so?

538
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:38,619
Del's been asking for a box.

539
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:43,248
Thinks the mouse will sleep in it,
I guess. Might keep it for a pet.

540
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:46,919
What do you think?

541
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:51,965
You know what?
We ought to find a cigar box...

542
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:57,095
...and get some cotton batting
from the dispensary to line it with.

543
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:59,223
Yeah.

544
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:02,476
Yeah. That should do real nice.

545
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:14,321
Man said get a cigar box.

546
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,374
Morning.

547
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:32,256
Hal, you wanted to see me?

548
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:33,840
Yeah.

549
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:35,884
Close the door.

550
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:44,559
So you know...

551
00:51:46,395 --> 00:51:48,897
...you got a new prisoner
coming in here tomorrow.

552
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:51,692
"William Wharton."

553
00:51:52,401 --> 00:51:54,069
He's what you call...

554
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:56,363
...a problem child.

555
00:51:57,197 --> 00:52:00,909
Got "Billy the Kid" tattooed
on his left arm.

556
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:05,205
Been rambling all over the state
last few years...

557
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:07,833
...causing all kinds of trouble.

558
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:10,544
Finally hit the big time.

559
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,215
Killed three people in a holdup.

560
00:52:15,424 --> 00:52:17,551
One of them a pregnant woman.

561
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:22,055
Bad news all around.

562
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:25,559
Hal?

563
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:37,738
It's a tumor, Paul.

564
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:41,158
A brain tumor.

565
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:44,578
They got...

566
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:46,997
...X-ray pictures of it.

567
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:50,917
It's the size of a lemon, they said.

568
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:54,921
And...

569
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:57,591
...way down...

570
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:01,636
...deep inside,
where they can't operate.

571
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,349
I haven't told her.

572
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,102
I can't think how.

573
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,983
For the life of me, Paul...

574
00:53:16,485 --> 00:53:19,488
...I can't think how
to tell my wife...

575
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:24,951
...she's going to die.

576
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:25,595
Oh.

577
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:31,476
Aah.

578
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:34,271
Aah!

579
00:54:43,864 --> 00:54:46,450
Oh!

580
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:51,705
Oh, God.

581
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:53,915
Oh, God.

582
00:54:57,794 --> 00:54:59,212
I'm going.

583
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:03,383
-What?
-To see Dr. Bishop. I'm going.

584
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:05,218
Today.

585
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:08,638
Soon as we get that new inmate
squared away.

586
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:10,307
That bad?

587
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,142
Oh, yeah.

588
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:36,416
The boy is doped to the gills.

589
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:39,252
Hmm?

590
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:40,629
Hand me them clothes.

591
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:45,592
William Wharton?

592
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:49,221
Hey! You put on these clothes now,
you hear?

593
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:59,439
We're gonna have to do this.

594
00:56:00,649 --> 00:56:02,275
Hellraiser, huh?

595
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:05,028
Look more like a limp noodle to me.

596
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:08,281
Hey. Hey.

597
00:56:08,949 --> 00:56:12,744
You've been declared competent, son.
You know what that means?

598
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:16,164
Means you're gonna ride the lightning.
Yeah.

599
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,918
Percy, could you shut up,
give us a hand here?

600
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:22,462
Hellraiser.

601
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:54,953
You don't look so good.

602
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:58,873
Look like you're running you a fever.

603
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:06,256
Boss Edgecomb?

604
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:09,676
I needs to see you down here, boss.

605
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:15,765
I got things to tend to just now,
John Coffey. You just...

606
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:20,604
You just stay still in your cell.

607
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:33,408
E Block.

608
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:11,154
Come on, let's go.

609
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:14,491
Come on. Look alive, big boy.

610
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,423
Careful.

611
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:37,097
-Careful.
-Step up. Step up.

612
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:13,925
Where you going? Where you going?

613
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:19,139
Ain't this a party now?

614
00:59:19,431 --> 00:59:20,640
-Is it or what?
-Let him go.

615
00:59:20,849 --> 00:59:22,475
-Shoot him.
-See who you hit.

616
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:24,644
-Shoot the son of a bitch.
-Shoot me!

617
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:28,148
-Shoot him!
-Hit him, Percy! Goddamn it! Hit him.

618
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:29,816
Hit me, you limp noodle.

619
00:59:30,024 --> 00:59:32,318
Hit him, Percy!
Goddamn it, hit him!

620
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:35,488
-Come on, Percy. Hit me.
-Wharton, I'm warning you.

621
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:38,533
-You warning me? Warn me now.
-I'm warning you!

622
00:59:38,742 --> 00:59:40,785
-You're warning me?!
-Shoot him!

623
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:42,328
Well, come on--

624
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:50,837
You're a big fucker.

625
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:52,630
Where'd you come from?

626
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:05,727
Come on, Dean. Come on, boy, get up.

627
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:07,520
All right. Now, just breathe.

628
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:10,190
That's it. Just breathe.
Just breathe.

629
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:13,777
Breathe. Breathe, boy.

630
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:16,988
-Didn't see it coming.
-Come on, boy, breathe.

631
01:00:17,197 --> 01:00:19,199
Come on. Just breathe.

632
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:24,204
We thought he was doped.

633
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:28,708
Didn't we? Didn't we, all of us,
think he was doped?

634
01:00:28,917 --> 01:00:30,668
You didn't ask?

635
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:33,880
Well, I guess that's not a mistake...

636
01:00:34,214 --> 01:00:37,425
...you'll be needing to make again
anytime soon, is it?

637
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:55,109
You go get Dean and Harry looked at.
Make sure they're all right.

638
01:00:55,568 --> 01:00:59,072
Percy, you make the report
to the warden for me.

639
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,866
Say the situation's under control.
It's not a story.

640
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:04,744
He won't appreciate you
drawing out the suspense.

641
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:07,163
What about you?
You're about to collapse.

642
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:10,750
I've got the Mile
till you all come back.

643
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:13,461
Go on, now. Go.

644
01:01:21,135 --> 01:01:24,264
Come on, boy. Let's get you looked at.

645
01:01:49,873 --> 01:01:53,293
Boss, I needs to see you down here.

646
01:01:56,838 --> 01:02:00,091
This is not a good time, John Coffey...

647
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:02,260
...not a good time at all.

648
01:02:02,468 --> 01:02:06,598
But I needs to see you, boss.
I needs to talk to you.

649
01:02:28,661 --> 01:02:29,954
Closer.

650
01:02:30,496 --> 01:02:32,540
Boss, you know you ain't
supposed to do that.

651
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:36,169
Mind your business, Del.

652
01:02:45,803 --> 01:02:47,847
What do you want, John Coffey?

653
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:50,016
Just to help it.

654
01:02:53,686 --> 01:02:55,104
Don't be afraid.

655
01:02:55,647 --> 01:02:56,689
Help!

656
01:02:57,523 --> 01:03:00,318
Help! John Coffey's
killing Boss Edgecomb!

657
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:02,028
Help!

658
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:05,448
-What are you doing?
-Help!

659
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:09,869
Boss Howell! Help!

660
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:12,330
Boss Stanton! Somebody, come!

661
01:03:12,664 --> 01:03:14,624
Help!

662
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:24,425
Aah!

663
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:33,267
Help! Boss Howell! Boss Stanton!

664
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:36,437
Somebody, come!
John Coffey's killing Boss Edgecomb!

665
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:39,273
-Del, for christ sakes, shut up!
-Hel--

666
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:28,114
What did you just do to me?

667
01:04:30,074 --> 01:04:31,784
I helped it.

668
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:34,454
Didn't I help it?

669
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:37,790
I just took it back, is all.

670
01:04:38,624 --> 01:04:41,085
Awful tired now, boss.

671
01:04:41,627 --> 01:04:43,296
Dog-tired.

672
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:10,490
Boss, what that man do to you?

673
01:05:50,321 --> 01:05:52,281
Ahh.

674
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:15,721
Hey, honey. How you feeling?

675
01:06:17,515 --> 01:06:20,268
Oh, not too bad.

676
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:23,271
What did the doctor say?

677
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:27,233
Oh, you know doctors.

678
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:29,569
Gobbledygook, mostly.

679
01:06:30,695 --> 01:06:32,071
Gobbledygook.

680
01:06:47,295 --> 01:06:48,921
Having stew tonight.

681
01:06:59,223 --> 01:07:00,933
What are you doing?

682
01:07:07,607 --> 01:07:09,483
What does it feel like?

683
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:12,778
Well, I know what it feels like.

684
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:18,326
It feels great.

685
01:07:52,777 --> 01:07:54,654
-Paul.
-Yeah?

686
01:07:55,112 --> 01:07:57,823
-Not that I'm complaining...
-Uh-huh.

687
01:07:58,991 --> 01:08:02,703
...but we haven't gone four times
in one night since we were 19.

688
01:08:02,954 --> 01:08:05,331
-Yeah, we did, at your mom's.
-Mm-hmm.

689
01:08:06,832 --> 01:08:08,834
Wanna tell me what's going on?

690
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:14,006
Well...

691
01:08:15,299 --> 01:08:17,301
...see, the thing is...

692
01:08:18,511 --> 01:08:22,056
...never actually made it in
to Dr. Bishop's yesterday.

693
01:08:25,351 --> 01:08:28,020
Brutal, Paul. Listen.

694
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:32,692
I'm thinking of taking the morning
off sick. You cover the fort for me?

695
01:08:33,734 --> 01:08:36,028
That's swell. Thanks.

696
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:38,864
Yeah, no, I'm sure I'll feel better.

697
01:08:39,073 --> 01:08:41,701
Okay. Okay.

698
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:49,041
You're sure you ought to do this?

699
01:08:50,668 --> 01:08:52,878
I'm not sure what I'm sure of.

700
01:09:09,729 --> 01:09:12,732
Burt, you got some company.

701
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:14,984
Can I offer you a cold drink?

702
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:18,321
Oh, yes, ma'am. A cold drink
would be fine. Thank you.

703
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:21,741
Mr. Hammersmith, your office said
I might find you at home.

704
01:09:21,949 --> 01:09:23,617
Hope I'm not troubling you.

705
01:09:24,285 --> 01:09:26,412
Well, that depends, Mr...?

706
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:30,624
Paul Edgecomb. I'm E Block supervisor
up on Cold Mountain.

707
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:33,210
The Green Mile.

708
01:09:33,419 --> 01:09:36,547
Yeah, I've heard of it.
Lost a few clients your way.

709
01:09:37,298 --> 01:09:39,925
I'd like to ask you about one of them.

710
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:43,179
-Have a seat.
-Thank you.

711
01:09:47,933 --> 01:09:49,685
Which client?

712
01:09:51,145 --> 01:09:53,939
Now you got my curiosity aroused.

713
01:09:54,148 --> 01:09:56,525
-John Coffey.
-Ah.

714
01:09:56,692 --> 01:09:58,110
Coffey.

715
01:09:58,277 --> 01:09:59,487
He causing you problems?

716
01:09:59,945 --> 01:10:03,532
No. Can't say he is. He doesn't like
the dark and cries on occasion...

717
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:05,618
...but other than that...

718
01:10:05,785 --> 01:10:09,080
He cries, does he?
Well, got a lot to cry about, I'd say.

719
01:10:09,288 --> 01:10:10,831
You know what he did.

720
01:10:11,499 --> 01:10:13,542
I read the court transcript.

721
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:17,213
-Thank you, missus.
-My pleasure.

722
01:10:18,089 --> 01:10:21,384
Kids! Lunch is about ready.
Y'all come on up.

723
01:10:21,634 --> 01:10:22,927
Coming, Mama!

724
01:10:23,135 --> 01:10:26,263
What exactly are you
trying to find out?

725
01:10:26,847 --> 01:10:29,183
I've wondered if he did anything
like that before.

726
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:32,645
Why? Has he said anything?

727
01:10:32,812 --> 01:10:35,981
No, but a man who does
a thing like that...

728
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:40,111
...has often developed a taste for it
over time. It occurred to me...

729
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:44,198
...that it might be easy enough
to follow his back trail. Find out.

730
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:48,786
A man his size, and colored to boot,
can't be that hard to trace.

731
01:10:48,994 --> 01:10:51,997
You'd think so, but you'd be wrong.

732
01:10:52,164 --> 01:10:54,333
Believe me, we tried.

733
01:10:55,167 --> 01:10:57,336
Like he'd dropped out of the sky.

734
01:10:58,170 --> 01:10:59,588
How can that be?

735
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:04,009
We're in a depression.
A third of the country's out of work.

736
01:11:04,218 --> 01:11:08,264
People are drifting by the thousands,
looking for jobs, for greener grass.

737
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:11,642
Even a giant like Coffey
wouldn't get noticed everywhere.

738
01:11:12,393 --> 01:11:14,728
Not until he kills
a couple of little girls.

739
01:11:15,563 --> 01:11:17,189
He is...

740
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:19,567
...strange, I admit.

741
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:24,238
But there doesn't seem to be
any real violence in him.

742
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:27,116
I know violent men, Mr. Hammersmith.

743
01:11:27,366 --> 01:11:30,202
I deal with them day in and day out.

744
01:11:30,995 --> 01:11:33,664
You didn't come to ask me
whether he killed before.

745
01:11:33,873 --> 01:11:36,792
You came to see if I think
he did it at all.

746
01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:39,879
Do you?

747
01:11:41,088 --> 01:11:43,257
One seldom sees
a less ambiguous case.

748
01:11:43,466 --> 01:11:45,551
He was found with the victims
in his arms.

749
01:11:45,718 --> 01:11:47,553
And yet you defended him.

750
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:51,140
Everyone is entitled to a defense.

751
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:53,184
Kids! Lunch!

752
01:11:53,392 --> 01:11:54,685
Y'all listen to your mama

753
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:00,900
I'll tell you something.

754
01:12:01,942 --> 01:12:05,571
And you listen close too, because it
might be something you need to know.

755
01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:07,114
I'm listening.

756
01:12:08,574 --> 01:12:10,493
We had us a dog.

757
01:12:10,659 --> 01:12:12,703
Just a sweet mongrel.

758
01:12:12,912 --> 01:12:14,413
You know the kind.

759
01:12:15,748 --> 01:12:19,210
Well, in many ways,
a good mongrel dog is like a Negro.

760
01:12:20,085 --> 01:12:21,837
You get to know it.

761
01:12:22,046 --> 01:12:26,425
Often, you get to love it.
It is of no particular use...

762
01:12:26,592 --> 01:12:30,137
...but you keep it around
because you think it loves you.

763
01:12:31,639 --> 01:12:35,768
If you're lucky, Mr. Edgecomb, you
never have to find out any different.

764
01:12:36,852 --> 01:12:39,063
My wife and I were not so lucky.

765
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:42,566
Caleb, come here for a second.

766
01:12:43,943 --> 01:12:45,152
Come here.

767
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:47,863
Please, son.

768
01:12:49,448 --> 01:12:51,951
He still has the one good eye.

769
01:12:53,285 --> 01:12:55,579
I suppose he's lucky...

770
01:12:55,788 --> 01:12:58,123
...not to be completely blind.

771
01:13:00,834 --> 01:13:04,630
We get down on our knees
and thank God for that much at least.

772
01:13:05,297 --> 01:13:06,674
Right, Caleb?

773
01:13:09,134 --> 01:13:10,469
Okay, go on in now.

774
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:16,809
That dog attacked my boy
for no reason.

775
01:13:17,434 --> 01:13:19,645
Just got it in his mind one day.

776
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:21,855
The same with John Coffey.

777
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:26,318
He was sorry afterwards.
Of that I have no doubt.

778
01:13:26,986 --> 01:13:28,821
But those little girls...

779
01:13:29,029 --> 01:13:31,490
...Stayed raped and murdered.

780
01:13:32,157 --> 01:13:34,159
Maybe he'd never done it before.

781
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:38,080
My dog never bit before.

782
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:42,543
But I didn't concern myself with that.

783
01:13:43,544 --> 01:13:47,506
I went out with my rifle, grabbed
his collar and blew his brains out.

784
01:13:48,882 --> 01:13:50,050
Is Coffey guilty?

785
01:13:53,012 --> 01:13:54,722
Yes, he is.

786
01:13:55,347 --> 01:13:57,016
Don't you doubt it.

787
01:13:57,349 --> 01:13:59,852
And don't you turn your back on him.

788
01:14:00,686 --> 01:14:04,857
You may get away with it once
or even a hundred times...

789
01:14:05,691 --> 01:14:07,359
...but in the end...

790
01:14:09,361 --> 01:14:10,821
...you'll get bit.

791
01:14:23,375 --> 01:14:25,919
Oh, me! Oh, my!

792
01:14:28,255 --> 01:14:31,216
John. John.

793
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:35,012
I'm smelling me some corn bread.

794
01:14:35,429 --> 01:14:37,348
It's from my missus.

795
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:43,395
She wanted to thank you.

796
01:14:44,772 --> 01:14:46,190
Thank me for what?

797
01:14:46,607 --> 01:14:47,900
Well, you know.

798
01:14:50,611 --> 01:14:52,029
For helping me.

799
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:54,281
Helping you with what?

800
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:56,116
You know.

801
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:00,663
Oh.

802
01:15:02,665 --> 01:15:04,625
Was your missus pleased?

803
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:08,128
Several times.

804
01:15:23,644 --> 01:15:27,147
Oh, John, I can smell that
from over here. I surely can.

805
01:15:30,025 --> 01:15:32,319
Can I give Del and Mr. Jingles some?

806
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:36,490
Well, it's yours, John.
You can do with it as you please.

807
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:43,038
Here. This for Del and Mr. Jingles.

808
01:15:43,789 --> 01:15:47,459
Hey! What about me?
I'm gonna get some too, ain't I?

809
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:52,673
It's yours, John. As you please.

810
01:15:53,298 --> 01:15:55,968
I think I'll just keep the rest, then.

811
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:04,017
Courtesy of the gentleman
across the way.

812
01:16:05,185 --> 01:16:09,064
Oh, John, that's so very fine of you.

813
01:16:10,023 --> 01:16:11,900
I thank you. Mr. Jingle thank you.

814
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:13,944
My mama would thank you too,
but she dead.

815
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:15,779
Welcome.

816
01:16:15,946 --> 01:16:21,326
Hey! What about me? Don't you
hold out on me, you big dummy nigger.

817
01:16:24,371 --> 01:16:26,874
Ooh, here come the boss man.

818
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:30,210
You'll keep a civil tongue
on my block.

819
01:16:41,638 --> 01:16:43,682
You get that one for free.

820
01:16:44,683 --> 01:16:46,310
But that's the last one.

821
01:16:46,518 --> 01:16:50,022
That's it?
Just that little itty-bitty one?

822
01:16:50,564 --> 01:16:53,901
I guess I'm gonna have
to pay you out for the rest.

823
01:17:06,705 --> 01:17:08,081
Yee-haw!

824
01:17:08,248 --> 01:17:10,167
Good shot, weren't it?

825
01:17:11,543 --> 01:17:13,670
The look on your face!

826
01:17:18,008 --> 01:17:19,593
Do you believe this?

827
01:17:19,802 --> 01:17:22,054
That son of a bitch pissed on me.

828
01:17:22,763 --> 01:17:23,931
Did y'all like that?

829
01:17:24,097 --> 01:17:27,226
I'm currently cooking up some turds
to go with it.

830
01:17:27,434 --> 01:17:29,061
Nice soft ones.

831
01:17:30,521 --> 01:17:32,481
Have them out to y'all tomorrow.

832
01:17:33,982 --> 01:17:37,027
We've been meaning to clean out
that room for a while, haven't we?

833
01:17:37,194 --> 01:17:38,403
Oh, yeah.

834
01:17:38,737 --> 01:17:42,241
Hey! Hey!
Be careful with that. That's fragile.

835
01:17:42,407 --> 01:17:46,912
Hey. Hey! What's it now?
What's it now? Moving day?

836
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,248
Y'all wanna come in here
and dust a little?

837
01:17:49,706 --> 01:17:53,627
You can shine my knob for me
while you're at it.

838
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:09,017
You can come in here on your legs...

839
01:18:09,226 --> 01:18:11,603
...but you'll go out on your backs.

840
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:15,065
Billy the Kid gonna
guarantee you that.

841
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:18,777
Come on, fuck-stick.
No sneaking up on me this time.

842
01:18:18,944 --> 01:18:20,946
We'll go man-to-man.

843
01:18:24,408 --> 01:18:25,492
Piss on me?

844
01:18:52,102 --> 01:18:54,771
Come on, Wild Bill.
Little walky-walky.

845
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:59,318
Don't you call me that!
Wild Bill Hickok wasn't no range rider!

846
01:18:59,526 --> 01:19:01,570
He was just some
bushwhacking John Law!

847
01:19:01,778 --> 01:19:04,698
Dumb son of a bitch sat with his back
to the door, killed by a drunk.

848
01:19:04,865 --> 01:19:07,492
Oh, my suds and body.
A history lesson.

849
01:19:08,118 --> 01:19:11,997
You never know what you'll get at work
every day on the Green Mile.

850
01:19:14,124 --> 01:19:15,792
Thank you, Wild Bill.

851
01:19:23,884 --> 01:19:26,720
Not in there. Not in there.
I'll be good.

852
01:19:26,929 --> 01:19:29,514
Honest injun, I will. I will.

853
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:38,315
-Christ, he's pitching a fit.
-He'll be fine, boys. Trust me on this.

854
01:19:38,482 --> 01:19:39,691
One, two, three.

855
01:19:41,568 --> 01:19:43,320
Hey. Hey!

856
01:19:47,824 --> 01:19:49,618
Hey, fellers.

857
01:19:49,868 --> 01:19:52,496
Hey, it's not funny.

858
01:19:55,707 --> 01:19:58,877
All I wanted me was a little
corn bread, you motherfuckers!

859
01:19:59,044 --> 01:20:01,672
All I wanted me was
a little corn bread!

860
01:20:09,554 --> 01:20:11,723
I learned my lesson.

861
01:20:11,932 --> 01:20:13,517
I'll be good.

862
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:26,405
Psst.

863
01:20:26,571 --> 01:20:27,614
Hey, Toot.

864
01:20:29,783 --> 01:20:31,785
Give you a nickel for that Moon Pie.

865
01:21:07,988 --> 01:21:10,323
Ooh, ooh.

866
01:21:10,490 --> 01:21:12,743
Little Black Sambo!

867
01:21:13,827 --> 01:21:17,622
Yes, sir, yes, sir. How do you do?

868
01:21:18,999 --> 01:21:21,251
Hope your bags are packed.

869
01:21:21,626 --> 01:21:23,628
My bags are packed! I'm ready to go!

870
01:21:23,795 --> 01:21:25,797
Where are we going? Let's go!

871
01:21:26,131 --> 01:21:28,675
No! No! No!

872
01:21:36,475 --> 01:21:38,977
Let me out of here!
Let me out of here!

873
01:21:39,144 --> 01:21:43,315
That Moon Pie thing was
pretty original. Gotta give him that.

874
01:21:45,025 --> 01:21:46,818
Oh, yeah.

875
01:22:01,374 --> 01:22:05,045
Del, grab up your things.
It's a big day for you and Mr. Jingles.

876
01:22:05,253 --> 01:22:06,630
What you talking about?

877
01:22:06,838 --> 01:22:10,425
Important folks heard about your mouse.
Wanna see him perform.

878
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:12,094
Not just prison guards either.

879
01:22:12,302 --> 01:22:15,514
One's a politician all the way
from the state capitol.

880
01:22:17,641 --> 01:22:19,101
You fellas coming?

881
01:22:19,309 --> 01:22:22,813
No, we got other fish to fry
just now, Del.

882
01:22:23,897 --> 01:22:26,358
But you knock them for a loop.

883
01:22:26,525 --> 01:22:28,360
You knock them for a loop, Del.

884
01:22:28,735 --> 01:22:30,987
Just like Mr. Harry says.

885
01:22:42,707 --> 01:22:45,043
Let's move briskly.
There's not much time.

886
01:22:45,544 --> 01:22:48,213
All right, rehearsing now!

887
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:50,882
Gotta move our ass.
Ain't got much time.

888
01:22:51,258 --> 01:22:54,553
I been fixing the plumbing here
for ten years.

889
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:57,013
Ain't never had to wear
no damn tie before.

890
01:22:57,222 --> 01:23:00,475
Well, you're the VIP today, Earl,
so just shut up.

891
01:23:02,894 --> 01:23:05,021
All right, everybody have a seat.

892
01:23:20,912 --> 01:23:22,539
This is great.

893
01:23:29,212 --> 01:23:30,755
All right.

894
01:23:31,298 --> 01:23:35,927
Eduard Delacroix, electricity shall
now be passed through your body...

895
01:23:36,094 --> 01:23:37,637
...until you are dead...

896
01:23:37,846 --> 01:23:40,223
...in accordance with state law.

897
01:23:40,557 --> 01:23:43,101
God have mercy on your soul.

898
01:23:51,776 --> 01:23:52,944
Roll on two.

899
01:23:57,115 --> 01:23:58,783
That's that.

900
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:04,623
Very good. Very professional.

901
01:24:07,125 --> 01:24:08,752
Let's do it again.

902
01:24:09,628 --> 01:24:12,339
You got all the words right.
It sounded just fine.

903
01:24:12,547 --> 01:24:13,924
-Thank you.
-Yep.

904
01:24:14,090 --> 01:24:17,010
It's hard to keep a straight face
when Toot's acting the goat.

905
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:20,305
You got that chin strap tight
because his head will buck--

906
01:24:20,805 --> 01:24:22,599
All right, break it up.

907
01:24:26,686 --> 01:24:29,731
-So?
-Oh, they love Mr. Jingles.

908
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:30,941
They laugh over there.

909
01:24:31,149 --> 01:24:35,487
They cheer. They clap their hands.

910
01:24:35,654 --> 01:24:37,614
Well, that's just aces.

911
01:24:38,406 --> 01:24:40,075
Isn't that something?

912
01:24:40,283 --> 01:24:42,452
You done good, old-timer.

913
01:24:42,661 --> 01:24:44,454
We're happy for you.

914
01:24:45,956 --> 01:24:47,791
Yeah, we are.

915
01:24:58,218 --> 01:25:01,346
-Boo!
-Aah!

916
01:25:04,349 --> 01:25:05,684
Percy, you shit.

917
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:10,689
Come on. Del, get up.

918
01:25:10,855 --> 01:25:14,484
Del, you numb-wit.
I didn't mean nothing by it.

919
01:25:14,693 --> 01:25:17,529
I was just playing. Come on, now.

920
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:19,823
I was just having--Aah!

921
01:25:21,866 --> 01:25:23,702
-Ain't you sweet.
-Wharton.

922
01:25:24,494 --> 01:25:26,538
-Soft like a girl.
-Let him go.

923
01:25:26,788 --> 01:25:28,707
I'd rather fuck your asshole...

924
01:25:28,873 --> 01:25:30,917
...than your sister's pussy, I think.

925
01:25:31,293 --> 01:25:32,502
Wharton!

926
01:25:37,841 --> 01:25:41,803
I let him go. I was just playing.
I let him go.

927
01:25:42,012 --> 01:25:44,431
I'd never hurt a hair
on his pretty little head.

928
01:25:45,181 --> 01:25:47,976
Your noodle ain't limp at all,
lover boy.

929
01:25:48,184 --> 01:25:50,895
I think you sweet on
old Billy the Kid.

930
01:25:52,022 --> 01:25:55,400
Ooh, but smell you.

931
01:26:02,115 --> 01:26:03,575
Look.

932
01:26:03,825 --> 01:26:05,243
He done piss his pants.

933
01:26:07,412 --> 01:26:09,247
Oh, my God.

934
01:26:10,707 --> 01:26:12,500
Look what the big man done.

935
01:26:12,709 --> 01:26:16,087
-He bust other people with a stick.
-Come on, get in.

936
01:26:18,214 --> 01:26:22,469
Somebody touch him, he make water
in his pants like a little baby.

937
01:26:23,970 --> 01:26:26,765
Del! Learn when to shut up.

938
01:26:27,974 --> 01:26:29,726
All right, now.

939
01:26:31,186 --> 01:26:32,812
Don't touch me.

940
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:48,870
You...

941
01:26:49,037 --> 01:26:51,748
You talk about this to anyone...

942
01:26:52,123 --> 01:26:54,334
...I'll get you all fired.

943
01:26:56,002 --> 01:26:58,713
I swear that to God.

944
01:26:59,297 --> 01:27:03,843
What happens on the Mile
stays on the Mile. Always has.

945
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:14,479
Yeah, you keep laughing,
you French-fried faggot!

946
01:27:14,979 --> 01:27:17,190
You just keep on laughing!

947
01:27:19,984 --> 01:27:22,612
Wetmore a good name for you!

948
01:27:24,864 --> 01:27:26,783
Percy Wetmore do a dance

949
01:27:26,991 --> 01:27:29,869
Listen to him squishing in his pant

950
01:27:41,214 --> 01:27:42,590
Well, what about Dean?

951
01:27:42,799 --> 01:27:44,342
He's got a little boy.

952
01:27:44,509 --> 01:27:47,137
He'd love to have a pet mouse, I bet.

953
01:27:49,722 --> 01:27:52,559
How could a boy be trusted
with Mr. Jingle?

954
01:27:52,976 --> 01:27:55,353
Maybe forget to feed him.

955
01:27:55,812 --> 01:27:59,524
How he keep up with his training?
I mean, he just a boy, n'est-ce pas?

956
01:27:59,774 --> 01:28:01,317
Mmm.

957
01:28:09,576 --> 01:28:11,870
All right. I'll take him, then.

958
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:14,247
Me.

959
01:28:15,707 --> 01:28:17,500
Thank you kindly, but...

960
01:28:18,877 --> 01:28:20,879
...you live out in the woods.

961
01:28:21,045 --> 01:28:23,047
Mr. Jingle, he be...

962
01:28:23,756 --> 01:28:27,010
He be scared to live
out in the big woods.

963
01:28:31,848 --> 01:28:33,558
How about Mouseville?

964
01:28:34,767 --> 01:28:38,396
-Mouseville?
-Tourist attraction down in Florida.

965
01:28:39,355 --> 01:28:40,899
Tallahassee, I think.

966
01:28:41,274 --> 01:28:45,069
-Is that right, Paul? Tallahassee?
-Yeah. Tallahassee.

967
01:28:45,236 --> 01:28:48,865
It's just down the road a piece
from the dog university.

968
01:28:51,201 --> 01:28:55,079
You think they'd take Mr. Jingles?

969
01:28:56,039 --> 01:28:59,751
-You think he's got the stuff?
-Well, he is pretty smart.

970
01:29:01,085 --> 01:29:02,712
What is Mouseville?

971
01:29:02,962 --> 01:29:04,923
Tourist attraction, I said.

972
01:29:05,256 --> 01:29:06,925
They got this big tent you go into.

973
01:29:07,133 --> 01:29:10,261
-You have to pay?
-Are you shitting me? Course you pay.

974
01:29:10,637 --> 01:29:14,265
-Dime apiece. Two cents for the kids.
-For the kids.

975
01:29:14,474 --> 01:29:16,643
Inside the tent they got this...

976
01:29:17,810 --> 01:29:19,437
...mouse city...

977
01:29:19,604 --> 01:29:21,105
...made out of...

978
01:29:21,314 --> 01:29:25,985
...old boxes and toilet paper rolls,
little windows so you can look in.

979
01:29:26,402 --> 01:29:30,782
Plus, they got
the Mouseville All-Star Circus.

980
01:29:31,950 --> 01:29:34,953
Yeah, there's mice
that swing on trapeze.

981
01:29:35,161 --> 01:29:38,665
Mice that roll barrels.
Mice that stack coins.

982
01:29:42,794 --> 01:29:43,878
Yeah, that's it.

983
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:47,340
That's the place for Mr. Jingles.

984
01:29:52,428 --> 01:29:55,431
You gonna be a circus mouse after all.

985
01:29:55,848 --> 01:29:59,769
You're gonna live in a mouse city
down in Florida.

986
01:30:03,273 --> 01:30:05,233
There he goes.

987
01:30:10,655 --> 01:30:14,450
No! Mr. Jingles!

988
01:30:14,617 --> 01:30:17,537
No! No! No!

989
01:30:23,293 --> 01:30:26,337
-You kill my mouse.
-I knew I'd get him sooner or later.

990
01:30:27,046 --> 01:30:29,465
It was just a matter of time, really.

991
01:30:29,674 --> 01:30:32,802
You fucking cruel bastard!

992
01:30:41,352 --> 01:30:42,895
Give him to me.

993
01:30:43,521 --> 01:30:46,190
Give him to me. Might still be time.

994
01:30:58,870 --> 01:31:00,413
What are you doing?

995
01:31:01,539 --> 01:31:03,124
Paul?

996
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,668
What the hell--?

997
01:31:05,918 --> 01:31:07,670
Please, John.

998
01:31:08,838 --> 01:31:10,048
Help him.

999
01:31:11,424 --> 01:31:13,509
Please, Johnny, help him.

1000
01:31:17,388 --> 01:31:19,974
Oh, dear Jesus.

1001
01:31:20,183 --> 01:31:21,559
The tail.

1002
01:31:22,268 --> 01:31:23,394
Look at the tail.

1003
01:32:53,901 --> 01:32:55,069
What did you do?

1004
01:32:55,528 --> 01:32:58,322
I helped Del's mouse...

1005
01:32:58,656 --> 01:33:00,032
...he's a circus mouse.

1006
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:02,952
Gonna live in a mouse city...

1007
01:33:03,119 --> 01:33:04,662
...down in...

1008
01:33:06,664 --> 01:33:07,874
Florida.

1009
01:33:11,002 --> 01:33:12,920
Boss Percy bad.

1010
01:33:13,171 --> 01:33:17,175
He mean. He step on Del's mouse.

1011
01:33:18,176 --> 01:33:20,011
I took it back, though.

1012
01:33:27,351 --> 01:33:28,686
Brute...

1013
01:33:29,437 --> 01:33:31,522
...you come along with me.

1014
01:33:31,689 --> 01:33:34,901
You fellas go on back
to your cribbage game.

1015
01:33:58,883 --> 01:34:01,344
Now, don't start in on me.

1016
01:34:01,677 --> 01:34:03,721
It was just a mouse.

1017
01:34:03,930 --> 01:34:06,307
Never belonged here
in the first place.

1018
01:34:06,516 --> 01:34:08,267
The mouse is fine.

1019
01:34:09,393 --> 01:34:13,022
Just fine. You're no better
at mouse-killing than you are...

1020
01:34:13,439 --> 01:34:15,483
...at anything else around here.

1021
01:34:17,568 --> 01:34:19,946
Yeah, you expect me to believe that?
Huh?

1022
01:34:21,739 --> 01:34:24,367
I heard the goddamn thing crunch.

1023
01:34:24,575 --> 01:34:26,911
Aren't you glad Mr. Jingles is okay?

1024
01:34:27,954 --> 01:34:30,248
After all those talks we had about...

1025
01:34:30,748 --> 01:34:32,583
...keeping the prisoners calm?

1026
01:34:33,251 --> 01:34:36,212
-Aren't you relieved?
-What kind of game is this?

1027
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:38,047
It's no game.

1028
01:34:38,214 --> 01:34:39,590
See for yourself.

1029
01:34:42,718 --> 01:34:43,928
Go on.

1030
01:34:57,275 --> 01:34:59,318
Don't let nothing happen
to Mr. Jingle.

1031
01:35:04,323 --> 01:35:07,660
You switched them. You switched them
somehow, you bastards.

1032
01:35:08,369 --> 01:35:12,623
I always keep a spare mouse
in my wallet for occasions such as this.

1033
01:35:12,790 --> 01:35:15,543
Yeah, you playing with me, huh?
Both of you.

1034
01:35:15,751 --> 01:35:18,129
Just who the hell you think you are?

1035
01:35:18,629 --> 01:35:20,756
Aah!

1036
01:35:21,048 --> 01:35:22,800
We're the people you work with.

1037
01:35:23,301 --> 01:35:24,969
But not for long.

1038
01:35:26,012 --> 01:35:27,972
Percy, I want your word.

1039
01:35:28,514 --> 01:35:29,974
My word?

1040
01:35:30,141 --> 01:35:32,643
I put you out front for Del...

1041
01:35:33,644 --> 01:35:36,814
...you put in your transfer
to Briar Ridge the very next day.

1042
01:35:37,982 --> 01:35:43,821
Well, what if I just call up certain people
and tell them you're harassing me?

1043
01:35:44,071 --> 01:35:46,324
-Bullying me.
-Go ahead.

1044
01:35:47,158 --> 01:35:50,077
I promise you'll leave your share
of blood on the floor.

1045
01:35:50,286 --> 01:35:52,955
-Over a mouse?
-No.

1046
01:35:53,664 --> 01:35:56,000
But four men
will swear you stood by...

1047
01:35:56,167 --> 01:35:58,127
...while Wild Bill
tried to strangle Dean to death.

1048
01:35:58,336 --> 01:36:02,298
About that, people will care. Even your
uncle the governor will care about that.

1049
01:36:02,506 --> 01:36:05,051
Thing like that goes
on your work record.

1050
01:36:05,551 --> 01:36:09,847
Work record can follow a man around
for a long, long time.

1051
01:36:10,097 --> 01:36:11,974
I put you out front...

1052
01:36:12,350 --> 01:36:14,560
...you put in for that transfer.

1053
01:36:16,145 --> 01:36:17,521
That's the deal.

1054
01:36:21,817 --> 01:36:23,361
All right.

1055
01:36:24,570 --> 01:36:26,072
All right.

1056
01:36:32,703 --> 01:36:35,206
You make a promise to a man,
you shake his hand.

1057
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:39,270
Hey, boys.

1058
01:37:40,604 --> 01:37:43,899
No, now, say hey, Mr. Jingles.

1059
01:37:46,068 --> 01:37:48,654
Eduard Delacroix, will you step forward?

1060
01:38:03,252 --> 01:38:04,545
Boss Edgecomb.

1061
01:38:05,171 --> 01:38:06,672
Yes, Del?

1062
01:38:06,881 --> 01:38:09,467
Don't let nothing happen
to Mr. Jingle, okay?

1063
01:38:11,052 --> 01:38:13,804
Here. You take him.

1064
01:38:19,435 --> 01:38:21,437
Del.

1065
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:25,649
I can't have a mouse
on my shoulder while...

1066
01:38:27,109 --> 01:38:28,903
...you know.

1067
01:38:30,237 --> 01:38:31,989
I'll take him, boss.

1068
01:38:32,656 --> 01:38:35,159
Just for now, if Del don't mind.

1069
01:38:37,995 --> 01:38:39,497
Yeah.

1070
01:38:39,997 --> 01:38:44,335
Yeah, you take him, John. You take him
till this foolishment be done.

1071
01:39:05,481 --> 01:39:08,192
You gonna take him to Florida,
to that Mouseville?

1072
01:39:08,359 --> 01:39:10,528
We'll do it together, most likely.

1073
01:39:11,737 --> 01:39:15,199
-Maybe take a little vacation time.
-Yeah.

1074
01:39:15,491 --> 01:39:18,202
People pay a dime apiece to see him.

1075
01:39:18,536 --> 01:39:21,372
Two cents for the kids.
Ain't that right, Boss Howell?

1076
01:39:21,539 --> 01:39:23,207
That's right, Del.

1077
01:39:25,459 --> 01:39:27,044
You're a good man, Boss Howell.

1078
01:39:30,714 --> 01:39:32,216
You too, Boss Edgecomb.

1079
01:39:36,387 --> 01:39:39,765
I sure wish I could've
met you guys somewheres else.

1080
01:40:18,679 --> 01:40:20,598
Hope he's good and scared.

1081
01:40:20,890 --> 01:40:25,603
Hope he knows the fires are stoked
and that Satan's imps are waiting.

1082
01:40:34,904 --> 01:40:36,697
Del, it's all right.

1083
01:41:19,490 --> 01:41:20,658
Roll on one.

1084
01:41:32,419 --> 01:41:35,256
You be still, Mr. Jingles.

1085
01:41:36,674 --> 01:41:40,094
You be so quiet and so still.

1086
01:41:43,764 --> 01:41:45,182
Eduard Delacroix...

1087
01:41:45,683 --> 01:41:49,019
...you've been condemned to die
by a jury of your peers.

1088
01:41:49,186 --> 01:41:53,023
Sentence imposed by a judge
in good standing in this state.

1089
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:56,360
You have anything to say
before sentence is carried out?

1090
01:42:04,910 --> 01:42:06,912
I sorry for what I--

1091
01:42:14,044 --> 01:42:16,380
I sorry for what I do.

1092
01:42:16,714 --> 01:42:19,133
I give anything to take it back.

1093
01:42:20,175 --> 01:42:21,844
But I can't.

1094
01:42:23,053 --> 01:42:25,222
God have mercy on me.

1095
01:42:26,807 --> 01:42:28,017
Amen.

1096
01:42:36,567 --> 01:42:38,319
Don't forget about Mouseville.

1097
01:42:40,946 --> 01:42:42,448
Hey...

1098
01:42:43,532 --> 01:42:44,950
...there's no such place.

1099
01:42:45,826 --> 01:42:49,371
That's just a fairy tale these guys
told you to keep you quiet.

1100
01:42:52,082 --> 01:42:54,585
Just thought you should know, faggot.

1101
01:43:56,647 --> 01:43:58,565
Eduard Delacroix...

1102
01:43:58,732 --> 01:44:02,319
...electricity shall now be passed
through your body until you are dead...

1103
01:44:02,820 --> 01:44:05,030
...in accordance with state law.

1104
01:44:06,156 --> 01:44:08,742
God have mercy on your soul.

1105
01:44:47,948 --> 01:44:49,158
Roll on two!

1106
01:45:05,883 --> 01:45:07,092
The sponge is dry.

1107
01:45:07,301 --> 01:45:09,178
What?

1108
01:45:13,724 --> 01:45:17,478
-The goddamn sponge is dry!
-Well, don't you stop it!

1109
01:45:17,686 --> 01:45:20,314
Don't you do it!
It's too late for that.

1110
01:45:35,412 --> 01:45:36,914
Is this normal?

1111
01:45:37,164 --> 01:45:39,833
God, the smell.

1112
01:45:41,001 --> 01:45:43,587
He's cooking now!
They cooking him good!

1113
01:45:44,046 --> 01:45:45,672
They're about done, I reckon!

1114
01:45:50,511 --> 01:45:53,013
We're gonna have a hoedown!

1115
01:45:58,018 --> 01:45:59,895
He's cooking now!

1116
01:46:00,145 --> 01:46:02,272
He's cooking now!

1117
01:46:02,439 --> 01:46:04,775
We gonna have a hoedown!

1118
01:46:05,067 --> 01:46:08,028
'Cution gumbo. Give me some!

1119
01:46:08,779 --> 01:46:10,155
Give me some!

1120
01:46:10,364 --> 01:46:12,366
I'm smelling gumbo! I'm smelling--

1121
01:46:13,700 --> 01:46:15,786
I said, give me some!

1122
01:46:19,373 --> 01:46:21,291
I smell it!

1123
01:46:22,793 --> 01:46:24,294
-Aah!
-Smell it!

1124
01:46:32,135 --> 01:46:34,972
-Should I kill the juice?
-No! Roll, for chrisssake, roll!

1125
01:46:58,579 --> 01:47:01,832
He's frying now! He's frying now!
He's frying now!

1126
01:47:04,793 --> 01:47:06,169
Why don't you shut it down?

1127
01:47:06,336 --> 01:47:09,756
He's still alive. You want me to
shut down while he's still alive?

1128
01:47:16,013 --> 01:47:18,765
You watch, you son of a bitch!

1129
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:22,853
It's all right, folks!
It's all under control!

1130
01:47:23,353 --> 01:47:26,231
Everybody stay calm!
Please, stay calm.

1131
01:47:32,195 --> 01:47:33,989
Kill it!

1132
01:47:40,162 --> 01:47:43,290
You do it!
You're running this show, ain't you?

1133
01:48:11,193 --> 01:48:13,779
I didn't know the sponge
is supposed to be wet.

1134
01:48:14,988 --> 01:48:16,073
Aah!

1135
01:48:16,239 --> 01:48:17,324
Brutal!

1136
01:48:17,574 --> 01:48:19,076
Brutal, no!

1137
01:48:19,284 --> 01:48:20,494
-No!
-What do you mean, no?

1138
01:48:20,702 --> 01:48:22,412
How can you say no?
You saw what he did!

1139
01:48:22,579 --> 01:48:23,413
Delacroix's dead!

1140
01:48:23,497 --> 01:48:25,582
Nothing can change that.
Percy's not worth it!

1141
01:48:25,832 --> 01:48:28,293
So he just gets away with it!
Is that how it works?

1142
01:48:36,802 --> 01:48:40,013
What in the blue fuck was that?

1143
01:48:41,014 --> 01:48:42,432
Jesus Christ.

1144
01:48:42,683 --> 01:48:45,560
There's puke
all over the floor up there.

1145
01:48:45,769 --> 01:48:47,521
And the smell.

1146
01:48:48,188 --> 01:48:52,109
I got Van Hay to open both doors, but
that smell won't go out for five years.

1147
01:48:52,317 --> 01:48:53,944
That's what I'm betting.

1148
01:48:54,861 --> 01:48:58,240
And that asshole Wharton
is singing about it!

1149
01:48:58,699 --> 01:49:00,117
You can hear him up there!

1150
01:49:00,701 --> 01:49:02,202
Can he carry a tune, Hal?

1151
01:49:13,964 --> 01:49:16,216
Okay, boys, okay.

1152
01:49:16,717 --> 01:49:19,761
Now, what in the hell happened?

1153
01:49:19,970 --> 01:49:22,931
An execution. A successful one.

1154
01:49:23,348 --> 01:49:27,477
How in the name of Christ
can you call that a success?

1155
01:49:28,270 --> 01:49:30,814
Eduard Delacroix is dead.

1156
01:49:32,482 --> 01:49:34,359
Isn't he?

1157
01:49:37,904 --> 01:49:39,740
Percy...

1158
01:49:40,449 --> 01:49:41,658
...something to say?

1159
01:49:45,662 --> 01:49:48,081
I didn't know the sponge
is supposed to be wet.

1160
01:49:49,458 --> 01:49:52,085
How many years you spend
pissing on a toilet seat...

1161
01:49:52,294 --> 01:49:56,465
-...before someone told you to put it up?
-Percy fucked up, Hal.

1162
01:49:56,673 --> 01:49:58,258
Pure and simple.

1163
01:49:58,842 --> 01:50:00,635
That's your official position?

1164
01:50:00,844 --> 01:50:02,804
Don't you think it should be?

1165
01:50:03,180 --> 01:50:07,184
He's putting in for a transfer request
to Briar Ridge tomorrow.

1166
01:50:07,434 --> 01:50:09,895
Moving on to bigger and better things.

1167
01:50:10,270 --> 01:50:11,688
Isn't that right, Percy?

1168
01:50:13,190 --> 01:50:14,649
Yeah. Yeah.

1169
01:50:14,816 --> 01:50:16,526
Barbecue

1170
01:50:16,693 --> 01:50:20,155
Me and you
Stinky, pinky

1171
01:50:21,198 --> 01:50:24,284
Weren't Billy, Jilly, Hilly or Pa

1172
01:50:24,493 --> 01:50:27,454
It was a French-fried Cajun
Named Delacroix

1173
01:50:27,913 --> 01:50:29,289
Whoo

1174
01:50:29,456 --> 01:50:32,501
Barbecue
Me and you

1175
01:50:32,709 --> 01:50:36,046
Stinky, pinky
Phew phew phew

1176
01:50:36,213 --> 01:50:37,714
Weren't Billy, Jilly--

1177
01:50:38,965 --> 01:50:43,220
You're ten seconds away from spending
the rest of your life in the padded room.

1178
01:51:01,321 --> 01:51:02,447
Poor old Del.

1179
01:51:04,199 --> 01:51:05,742
Yeah.

1180
01:51:06,368 --> 01:51:08,036
Poor old Del.

1181
01:51:10,580 --> 01:51:12,249
John...

1182
01:51:14,084 --> 01:51:15,460
...you okay?

1183
01:51:16,711 --> 01:51:18,964
I could feel it from here.

1184
01:51:19,589 --> 01:51:21,007
What do you mean?

1185
01:51:21,967 --> 01:51:23,552
You could hear it.

1186
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:26,012
Is that what you mean?
You could hear it.

1187
01:51:26,263 --> 01:51:28,181
He out of it now, though.

1188
01:51:29,015 --> 01:51:30,851
He the lucky one.

1189
01:51:31,434 --> 01:51:35,105
No matter how it happened,
Del the lucky one.

1190
01:51:41,903 --> 01:51:43,530
Where's Mr. Jingles?

1191
01:51:44,614 --> 01:51:47,117
He run away under that door.

1192
01:51:48,702 --> 01:51:50,871
Don't think he'll be back.

1193
01:51:52,289 --> 01:51:54,791
He felt it too, through me.

1194
01:51:56,543 --> 01:51:58,628
Didn't mean to hurt him none.

1195
01:51:59,129 --> 01:52:02,132
All that hurt just spill out.

1196
01:52:08,889 --> 01:52:11,224
Awful tired now, boss.

1197
01:52:13,059 --> 01:52:14,769
Dog-tired.

1198
01:52:20,609 --> 01:52:22,235
Me too, John.

1199
01:52:24,988 --> 01:52:26,656
Me too.

1200
01:53:26,091 --> 01:53:27,717
I hate this.

1201
01:53:28,510 --> 01:53:29,844
I know.

1202
01:53:44,859 --> 01:53:47,654
Melinda, hi.

1203
01:53:51,574 --> 01:53:53,243
I am so happy to see you.

1204
01:53:55,161 --> 01:53:56,997
Look at you.

1205
01:53:57,914 --> 01:53:59,916
We missed you at church.

1206
01:54:03,753 --> 01:54:06,131
My hair--

1207
01:54:06,381 --> 01:54:09,217
-You look fine.
-I'm just a mess.

1208
01:54:14,597 --> 01:54:16,891
She's having one of her good days.

1209
01:54:17,434 --> 01:54:19,352
I thank God for that.

1210
01:54:21,896 --> 01:54:23,606
What's a bad day?

1211
01:54:26,943 --> 01:54:28,862
Sometimes she's...

1212
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:31,698
She's not herself anymore.

1213
01:54:32,407 --> 01:54:33,783
She swears.

1214
01:54:34,034 --> 01:54:35,452
She swears?

1215
01:54:35,744 --> 01:54:37,287
It just pops out.

1216
01:54:37,954 --> 01:54:40,623
Most awful language you can imagine.

1217
01:54:40,790 --> 01:54:43,126
She doesn't even know she's doing it.

1218
01:54:44,461 --> 01:54:47,297
I didn't know she'd ever heard
words like that.

1219
01:54:47,547 --> 01:54:50,717
To hear her say them
in her sweet voice...

1220
01:54:54,929 --> 01:54:57,432
I'm glad she's having
a good day, Paul.

1221
01:54:58,558 --> 01:55:00,977
I'm glad for you and Jan.

1222
01:55:17,077 --> 01:55:18,495
Honey...

1223
01:55:18,703 --> 01:55:21,331
...if you don't tell me
what's on your mind...

1224
01:55:21,956 --> 01:55:25,168
...I'm afraid I'll have to smother you
with a pillow.

1225
01:55:34,094 --> 01:55:36,137
I'm thinking I love you.

1226
01:55:38,014 --> 01:55:41,518
I'm thinking I don't know
what I would do if you were gone.

1227
01:55:43,436 --> 01:55:44,854
Oh.

1228
01:55:47,857 --> 01:55:51,277
I'm also thinking I'm gonna
have the boys over tomorrow.

1229
01:55:55,365 --> 01:55:57,992
Well, you sure do know
how to cook chicken.

1230
01:55:58,159 --> 01:55:59,494
Well, thank you.

1231
01:55:59,744 --> 01:56:02,539
This is one delicious treat, ma'am,
before I go to work.

1232
01:56:02,747 --> 01:56:04,207
I'm glad you're enjoying it.

1233
01:56:04,624 --> 01:56:06,876
Hey, Brutal, you gonna hog
all them taters?

1234
01:56:07,043 --> 01:56:09,671
Yes, I am.
Harry, you want some potatoes?

1235
01:56:09,879 --> 01:56:12,048
-Come on, now.
-What?

1236
01:56:12,715 --> 01:56:15,051
Soon we'll just see your feet
sticking out of there, Brutus.

1237
01:56:15,260 --> 01:56:17,554
You all saw what he did to the mouse.

1238
01:56:20,390 --> 01:56:22,809
I could've gone the rest of the day
without you bringing that up.

1239
01:56:23,059 --> 01:56:24,811
I could've gone
the rest of the year.

1240
01:56:25,270 --> 01:56:27,063
He did the same thing to me.

1241
01:56:27,480 --> 01:56:29,566
He put his hands on me.

1242
01:56:30,316 --> 01:56:32,402
He took my bladder infection away.

1243
01:56:37,323 --> 01:56:40,869
It's true. When he came home that day,
he was...

1244
01:56:42,412 --> 01:56:43,788
...all better.

1245
01:56:45,290 --> 01:56:48,251
Oh, now, wait. You're talking about...

1246
01:56:48,418 --> 01:56:50,086
...an authentic healing?

1247
01:56:51,421 --> 01:56:52,797
A praise-Jesus miracle?

1248
01:56:53,548 --> 01:56:54,799
I am.

1249
01:56:55,675 --> 01:56:57,260
Oh, yeah.

1250
01:56:57,427 --> 01:57:00,346
Well, if you say it, I accept it.

1251
01:57:01,306 --> 01:57:03,308
What's it got to do with us?

1252
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:06,769
-You're thinking about Melinda.
-Melinda?

1253
01:57:07,353 --> 01:57:10,106
-Melinda Moores?
-Yeah. So, Paul...

1254
01:57:10,273 --> 01:57:12,609
...you really think you can help her?

1255
01:57:12,859 --> 01:57:17,113
It's not a bladder infection
or even a busted mouse...

1256
01:57:18,114 --> 01:57:20,950
-...but there might be a chance.
-Hold on now.

1257
01:57:21,117 --> 01:57:25,121
You're talking about our jobs.
Sneak a sick woman into a cellblock?

1258
01:57:25,455 --> 01:57:28,291
Oh, no. No, no.
Hal would never stand for that.

1259
01:57:28,458 --> 01:57:31,294
You know him. He wouldn't believe
anything if it fell on him.

1260
01:57:31,461 --> 01:57:33,463
So you're talking about...

1261
01:57:33,630 --> 01:57:35,632
...taking John Coffey to her.

1262
01:57:40,637 --> 01:57:43,306
That's more than just our jobs, Paul.

1263
01:57:44,307 --> 01:57:46,976
-That's prison time, we get caught.
-You're dang right it is.

1264
01:57:47,143 --> 01:57:48,978
No, not for you, Dean.

1265
01:57:49,145 --> 01:57:52,315
The way I figure it,
you stay back on the Mile.

1266
01:57:52,482 --> 01:57:54,150
That way, you can deny everything.

1267
01:57:54,984 --> 01:57:56,486
Why do I have to stay behind?

1268
01:57:57,153 --> 01:58:00,490
Well, our boy's grown up...

1269
01:58:00,657 --> 01:58:01,991
...gone off to school.

1270
01:58:02,158 --> 01:58:04,994
Harry's girls,
they're all married now.

1271
01:58:05,161 --> 01:58:06,412
Brutal's a single man.

1272
01:58:06,663 --> 01:58:09,999
You're the only one here with
two children, another one on the way.

1273
01:58:10,375 --> 01:58:13,461
Let's not discuss this as if
we're thinking of doing it.

1274
01:58:15,672 --> 01:58:18,383
Brutal, help me out here.

1275
01:58:19,676 --> 01:58:23,179
-I'm sure she's a fine woman.
-The finest.

1276
01:58:23,346 --> 01:58:25,682
What is happening to her
is an offense, Brutal...

1277
01:58:25,890 --> 01:58:28,351
...10 the eye and the ear
and to the heart.

1278
01:58:28,518 --> 01:58:30,687
I have no doubt.

1279
01:58:31,646 --> 01:58:33,690
But we don't know her
like you and Jan do.

1280
01:58:33,898 --> 01:58:37,026
And let's not forget,
John Coffey is a murderer.

1281
01:58:38,152 --> 01:58:40,363
Now, what if he escapes?

1282
01:58:40,530 --> 01:58:43,700
I'd hate to lose my job
or go to prison...

1283
01:58:43,950 --> 01:58:47,203
...but I'd hate worse to have
a dead child on my conscience.

1284
01:58:47,453 --> 01:58:49,539
I don't think that's gonna happen.

1285
01:58:50,915 --> 01:58:52,292
In fact...

1286
01:58:54,919 --> 01:58:56,713
...I don't think he did it at all.

1287
01:58:59,882 --> 01:59:03,636
I do not see God putting
a gift like that...

1288
01:59:03,845 --> 01:59:05,930
...in the hands of a man
who'd kill a child.

1289
01:59:06,222 --> 01:59:10,560
That's a very tender notion, but
the man is on death row for the crime.

1290
01:59:12,395 --> 01:59:13,563
And plus...

1291
01:59:13,938 --> 01:59:16,024
...he's huge.

1292
01:59:16,190 --> 01:59:20,862
If he tried to get away, it'd take
a lot of bullets to stop him.

1293
01:59:21,070 --> 01:59:25,241
We'd all have shotguns,
in addition to side arms.

1294
01:59:25,658 --> 01:59:26,951
I'd insist on that.

1295
01:59:28,244 --> 01:59:30,997
If he tried anything,
anything at all...

1296
01:59:31,664 --> 01:59:33,541
...we'd have to take him down.

1297
01:59:34,167 --> 01:59:36,044
You understand?

1298
01:59:47,013 --> 01:59:48,723
So...

1299
01:59:49,098 --> 01:59:51,267
...tell us what you had in mind.

1300
01:59:58,107 --> 02:00:00,902
-Oh, there it is.
-Oh, I see it.

1301
02:00:11,579 --> 02:00:13,581
You think this is enough?

1302
02:00:14,749 --> 02:00:16,292
I don't know.

1303
02:00:53,037 --> 02:00:54,831
You fellas thirsty?

1304
02:00:55,039 --> 02:00:56,541
Fresh out of the icebox.

1305
02:00:56,749 --> 02:01:00,420
-You bet. That's swell, Brutal. Thanks.
-Oh, yeah.

1306
02:01:00,628 --> 02:01:02,839
Hot in here. Boy, howdy.

1307
02:01:03,047 --> 02:01:06,300
Hey, hey. I'm gonna
get some too, ain't I?

1308
02:01:06,509 --> 02:01:09,929
-My ass, you get some too.
-What makes you think you deserve any?

1309
02:01:10,555 --> 02:01:12,682
Because I got a big pecker.

1310
02:01:12,849 --> 02:01:15,685
Well, the day report says
he's been okay.

1311
02:01:16,185 --> 02:01:17,979
Hell, yeah, I been behaved.

1312
02:01:18,146 --> 02:01:20,606
Come on, now.
Don't be stingy hogs.

1313
02:01:23,860 --> 02:01:25,194
Come on.

1314
02:01:26,362 --> 02:01:28,364
Come on now, fellers.

1315
02:01:29,574 --> 02:01:30,783
Come on, boss.

1316
02:01:31,033 --> 02:01:32,869
I been good all day.

1317
02:01:36,080 --> 02:01:37,790
It's hot in here.

1318
02:01:38,040 --> 02:01:41,544
It's hot in this cell, and I'm
dogged to drink. I'm thirsty.

1319
02:01:41,711 --> 02:01:43,629
Why don't you give me some?

1320
02:01:50,386 --> 02:01:51,679
Come on.

1321
02:01:56,726 --> 02:01:58,728
You gonna stay behaved?

1322
02:01:58,895 --> 02:02:02,231
-Come on, you clunk, give me that.
-You promise me...

1323
02:02:02,607 --> 02:02:04,817
...or I'll drink this myself
right here.

1324
02:02:05,067 --> 02:02:07,737
Don't--Come on, now.
Don't be that way.

1325
02:02:08,237 --> 02:02:09,739
I'll be good.

1326
02:02:34,680 --> 02:02:36,057
Cup.

1327
02:03:26,482 --> 02:03:28,985
Anybody wants out, now's the time.

1328
02:03:29,694 --> 02:03:31,487
After this, there's no turning back.

1329
02:03:32,989 --> 02:03:34,198
So?

1330
02:03:35,074 --> 02:03:36,617
We gonna do this?

1331
02:03:36,784 --> 02:03:39,787
Sure. That'd be just fine.

1332
02:03:39,996 --> 02:03:42,206
I'd like to take a ride.

1333
02:03:47,461 --> 02:03:49,505
Guess we're all in.

1334
02:04:00,516 --> 02:04:01,851
What is this?

1335
02:04:04,312 --> 02:04:07,023
-Payback.
-That's right.

1336
02:04:07,940 --> 02:04:08,774
No.

1337
02:04:11,736 --> 02:04:14,614
-No, you let me go! Let go of me!
-Settle down.

1338
02:04:14,822 --> 02:04:15,865
-Let go!
-Settle down.

1339
02:04:16,032 --> 02:04:18,367
-What are you doing?
-Settle down.

1340
02:04:24,790 --> 02:04:25,958
Ooh.

1341
02:04:26,542 --> 02:04:29,378
-"Miss Lotta Leadpipe."
-Oh, Percy.

1342
02:04:29,545 --> 02:04:32,798
-What would your mother say?
-You let go of me, you ignoramus.

1343
02:04:33,007 --> 02:04:35,760
I know people. Big people!

1344
02:04:36,135 --> 02:04:39,221
Percy, stick out your arms
like a good lad.

1345
02:04:39,388 --> 02:04:41,390
No, I won't do it.
You can't make me.

1346
02:04:41,557 --> 02:04:44,226
You're dead wrong about that,
you know.

1347
02:04:49,899 --> 02:04:52,234
You gonna put your arms up?

1348
02:04:53,069 --> 02:04:56,238
A big man is ripping your ears off.
I'd do as he says.

1349
02:04:56,405 --> 02:04:58,199
Aah!

1350
02:04:58,366 --> 02:05:00,034
There you go.

1351
02:05:08,250 --> 02:05:09,669
Please, Paul.

1352
02:05:09,877 --> 02:05:13,673
Please don't put me in with Wild Bill.
Please don't.

1353
02:05:14,924 --> 02:05:16,842
You would think that.

1354
02:05:18,552 --> 02:05:20,930
No, no, you can't do this to me.

1355
02:05:21,097 --> 02:05:23,599
You can't do this to me. You can't.

1356
02:05:23,808 --> 02:05:26,185
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret, Percy.

1357
02:05:26,394 --> 02:05:29,522
We can and we are.

1358
02:05:36,278 --> 02:05:40,908
We'll give you a few hours of quiet time
to reflect on what you did to Del.

1359
02:05:41,117 --> 02:05:44,787
And if you get lonely,
just think about Miss Leadpipe.

1360
02:05:53,629 --> 02:05:55,798
All right, let's go over it
one more time.

1361
02:05:55,965 --> 02:05:58,134
What do you say
if somebody stops by?

1362
02:05:59,969 --> 02:06:01,804
Coffey got upset after lights out...

1363
02:06:01,971 --> 02:06:05,266
...So we put the coat on him,
locked him in the restraint room.

1364
02:06:05,474 --> 02:06:07,351
They hear kicking,
they'll think it's him.

1365
02:06:07,560 --> 02:06:08,602
What about me?

1366
02:06:08,769 --> 02:06:11,647
You're in Admin pulling Del's file,
going over the witnesses...

1367
02:06:11,856 --> 02:06:14,734
...on account of how big a screwup
the execution was.

1368
02:06:16,986 --> 02:06:18,738
We going for the ride now?

1369
02:06:18,988 --> 02:06:21,615
That's right. We going for the ride.

1370
02:06:23,743 --> 02:06:25,161
What about us, Dean?

1371
02:06:25,369 --> 02:06:29,165
You, Harry, Percy, all down
in the laundry doing your wash.

1372
02:06:29,415 --> 02:06:32,001
Probably take a few hours
before you're back.

1373
02:06:35,379 --> 02:06:37,506
Where you think you going?

1374
02:06:44,096 --> 02:06:45,514
You a bad man.

1375
02:06:45,681 --> 02:06:48,017
That's right, nigger.
Bad as you'd want.

1376
02:06:55,816 --> 02:06:57,693
What's wrong? What's wrong?

1377
02:06:58,027 --> 02:06:59,445
What's wrong?

1378
02:07:19,465 --> 02:07:21,884
Whoo!

1379
02:07:23,385 --> 02:07:26,555
Whole room...
Whole room's spinning.

1380
02:07:26,722 --> 02:07:29,016
It's like I'm shitty-ass drunk.

1381
02:07:29,225 --> 02:07:31,560
Had me some shine or...

1382
02:07:32,311 --> 02:07:33,687
Or what?

1383
02:07:35,940 --> 02:07:38,692
Niggers ought to have
their own electric chair.

1384
02:07:38,901 --> 02:07:40,528
White man...

1385
02:07:40,736 --> 02:07:45,324
...ought not to have to sit in
no nigger electric chair. No, sir.

1386
02:07:52,456 --> 02:07:55,209
He a bad man.

1387
02:08:14,770 --> 02:08:15,980
Look, boss.

1388
02:08:20,568 --> 02:08:23,112
-It's Cassie, the lady in the rocking chair.
-Shh!

1389
02:08:23,904 --> 02:08:25,698
John, we have to be quiet now.

1390
02:08:26,240 --> 02:08:28,617
You see her? You see the lady?

1391
02:08:28,868 --> 02:08:30,953
Yeah, we see her, John. Come on.

1392
02:08:42,298 --> 02:08:44,300
Let's go. Go, go!

1393
02:08:48,637 --> 02:08:49,805
Now!

1394
02:09:25,966 --> 02:09:28,969
All right, big boy. Let's get moving.
Come on.

1395
02:10:02,586 --> 02:10:04,004
Upsy-daisy.

1396
02:10:12,221 --> 02:10:15,891
John, do you know
where we're taking you tonight?

1397
02:10:19,228 --> 02:10:20,479
Help a lady?

1398
02:10:22,398 --> 02:10:23,899
That's right.

1399
02:10:24,733 --> 02:10:25,901
But how do you know?

1400
02:10:27,736 --> 02:10:29,113
Don't know.

1401
02:10:31,031 --> 02:10:35,619
Tell the truth, boss,
I don't know much of anything.

1402
02:10:36,912 --> 02:10:38,122
I never have.

1403
02:11:13,449 --> 02:11:15,451
We can still turn back.

1404
02:11:17,369 --> 02:11:19,955
Boss, look. Someone's up.

1405
02:11:22,166 --> 02:11:23,959
This was a mistake.

1406
02:11:24,376 --> 02:11:29,673
-Oh, Christ, what were we thinking?
-It's too late now. John, you stay.

1407
02:11:34,136 --> 02:11:37,139
Harry, you keep John here
till we call you.

1408
02:11:47,316 --> 02:11:49,568
Who the hell goes there at 2:30
in the goddamn morning?

1409
02:11:49,735 --> 02:11:52,488
Hal, it's us. It's Paul and Brutal.

1410
02:11:52,738 --> 02:11:54,156
-It's us.
-Jesus.

1411
02:11:54,323 --> 02:11:56,492
It isn't a lockdown, is it?
Or a riot?

1412
02:11:56,742 --> 02:12:00,329
No. Hal, for God's sakes,
just take your finger off the trigger.

1413
02:12:00,496 --> 02:12:02,331
Are you hostages?

1414
02:12:02,831 --> 02:12:04,208
Who's out there?

1415
02:12:04,583 --> 02:12:06,502
-Who's by that truck?
-Harry, the lights!

1416
02:12:11,006 --> 02:12:12,841
John Coffey.

1417
02:12:13,342 --> 02:12:14,510
-Halt!
-Hal.

1418
02:12:14,718 --> 02:12:16,970
-You stay where you are!
-Relax, now. Take it easy, now.

1419
02:12:17,221 --> 02:12:19,139
-Don't you move!
-Wait!

1420
02:12:19,348 --> 02:12:20,641
-I'm warning you.
-John, wait!

1421
02:12:20,849 --> 02:12:22,351
-Hal, listen!
-Halt or I'll shoot!

1422
02:12:22,601 --> 02:12:24,603
-I said, halt! Halt!
-Hal, put the gun down!

1423
02:12:24,853 --> 02:12:26,688
-Hal.
-Hal!

1424
02:12:28,732 --> 02:12:32,778
Hal, who you talking to down there?

1425
02:12:33,028 --> 02:12:37,366
-Goddamn it!
-Hal, now, nobody is hurt.

1426
02:12:37,533 --> 02:12:38,659
And we are here to help.

1427
02:12:38,867 --> 02:12:42,037
Help what? I don't understand.

1428
02:12:42,287 --> 02:12:45,124
You're just gonna have to trust me.

1429
02:13:01,723 --> 02:13:04,768
-What do you want?
-Hal!

1430
02:13:05,811 --> 02:13:07,813
Make them go away!

1431
02:13:08,689 --> 02:13:10,691
I don't want no salesmen...

1432
02:13:10,899 --> 02:13:14,528
...in the middle of the night.

1433
02:13:15,070 --> 02:13:18,824
Tell them to take a flying fuck
at a rolling...

1434
02:13:19,074 --> 02:13:20,409
Just to help.

1435
02:13:21,160 --> 02:13:23,996
Just to help, boss. That's all.

1436
02:13:24,580 --> 02:13:27,916
You can't. No one can.

1437
02:13:39,261 --> 02:13:41,680
-Stay out of here!
-Don't you go in there!

1438
02:13:41,930 --> 02:13:44,850
-Whoever you are, just stay out!
-Don't you do it!

1439
02:13:45,434 --> 02:13:48,103
I'm not dressed for visitors.

1440
02:13:49,771 --> 02:13:52,316
You stop now. You hear me?

1441
02:13:52,941 --> 02:13:55,611
-Paul, I don't want him up there.
-Boss...

1442
02:13:55,944 --> 02:13:58,113
...you just be quiet now.

1443
02:14:45,869 --> 02:14:48,247
It's all right, Hal. It's all right.

1444
02:14:48,497 --> 02:14:50,999
Hal, watch. Just watch him.

1445
02:14:57,172 --> 02:14:59,758
Don't come near me, pig fucker.

1446
02:15:13,605 --> 02:15:15,899
Why do you have so many scars?

1447
02:15:18,777 --> 02:15:21,029
Who hurt you so badly?

1448
02:15:22,614 --> 02:15:24,950
Don't hardly remember, ma'am.

1449
02:15:27,452 --> 02:15:29,288
What's your name?

1450
02:15:29,871 --> 02:15:33,041
John Coffey, ma'am.
Like the drink...

1451
02:15:33,375 --> 02:15:35,711
...only not spelt the same.

1452
02:15:42,384 --> 02:15:43,468
Ma'am?

1453
02:15:51,476 --> 02:15:53,437
Yes, John Coffey?

1454
02:15:55,147 --> 02:15:56,732
I see it.

1455
02:15:57,399 --> 02:15:58,567
I see it.

1456
02:16:05,741 --> 02:16:08,410
What's happening?

1457
02:16:09,244 --> 02:16:13,915
Shh, you be still now.
You be so quiet and so still.

1458
02:17:40,585 --> 02:17:43,046
Come on, John. Sick it up.

1459
02:17:43,338 --> 02:17:45,590
Come on. Cough it out
like you done before.

1460
02:17:47,175 --> 02:17:50,929
He's choking. Whatever he sucked out
of her, he's choking on it.

1461
02:17:51,555 --> 02:17:52,597
John.

1462
02:17:54,182 --> 02:17:56,768
I'll be fine. Just let me be.

1463
02:18:10,532 --> 02:18:11,783
How did I get here?

1464
02:18:16,204 --> 02:18:19,291
We were going to the hospital
in Vicksburg.

1465
02:18:19,583 --> 02:18:20,876
Remember?

1466
02:18:21,084 --> 02:18:23,795
Shh, Melly...

1467
02:18:23,962 --> 02:18:25,797
...It doesn't matter.

1468
02:18:26,548 --> 02:18:28,049
It doesn't matter anymore.

1469
02:18:28,216 --> 02:18:30,886
Did I have the x-ray?

1470
02:18:31,553 --> 02:18:33,054
Did I?

1471
02:18:35,724 --> 02:18:36,975
Yes.

1472
02:18:37,893 --> 02:18:41,897
Yes. It was clear.
There was no tumor.

1473
02:18:46,693 --> 02:18:47,861
Oh.

1474
02:18:57,913 --> 02:19:02,167
John, can you stand up?
Can you turn around and see this lady?

1475
02:19:15,597 --> 02:19:17,182
What's your name?

1476
02:19:18,433 --> 02:19:20,644
John Coffey, ma'am.

1477
02:19:22,103 --> 02:19:23,772
Like the drink.

1478
02:19:25,190 --> 02:19:27,275
Only not spelt the same.

1479
02:19:27,651 --> 02:19:31,363
No, ma'am, not spelt the same at all.

1480
02:19:34,241 --> 02:19:37,619
Melly... No, you can't.

1481
02:20:02,310 --> 02:20:04,396
I dreamed of you.

1482
02:20:07,190 --> 02:20:10,068
I dreamed you were wandering
in the dark.

1483
02:20:11,570 --> 02:20:13,488
And so was I.

1484
02:20:15,323 --> 02:20:17,492
And we found each other.

1485
02:20:18,410 --> 02:20:20,996
We found each other in the dark.

1486
02:20:40,515 --> 02:20:42,267
Take it, John. It's a present.

1487
02:20:42,684 --> 02:20:44,769
It's St. Christopher.

1488
02:20:46,021 --> 02:20:48,231
I want you to have it, Mr. Coffey.

1489
02:20:49,024 --> 02:20:51,526
And wear it. He'll keep you safe.

1490
02:20:51,943 --> 02:20:53,445
Please.

1491
02:20:53,862 --> 02:20:55,530
Wear it for me.

1492
02:21:10,045 --> 02:21:11,880
Thank you, ma'am.

1493
02:21:13,965 --> 02:21:15,800
Thank you, John.

1494
02:21:22,599 --> 02:21:27,312
Christ, he goes down, it'll take three
mules and a crane to pick him up again.

1495
02:21:27,562 --> 02:21:31,316
Take it easy, John.
You gotta stay on your feet.

1496
02:21:46,998 --> 02:21:50,085
He'll never sit in Old Sparky.
You know that, don't you?

1497
02:21:50,418 --> 02:21:52,587
He swallowed that stuff for a reason.

1498
02:21:53,421 --> 02:21:55,590
I give him a few days.

1499
02:21:55,840 --> 02:21:59,761
One of us will be doing a cell check,
and he'll be dead on his bunk.

1500
02:21:59,928 --> 02:22:02,222
Well, if that's his choice,
he's earned it.

1501
02:22:02,430 --> 02:22:04,683
Let's just get him back on the Mile.

1502
02:22:18,530 --> 02:22:21,116
Am I happy to see you.
You were gone so long.

1503
02:22:21,324 --> 02:22:23,410
Wild Bill's making noise
like he's waking up.

1504
02:22:23,618 --> 02:22:28,123
-What the hell happened to him?
-He's hurting, Dean. He's hurting bad.

1505
02:22:31,584 --> 02:22:34,796
Okay, John. We gonna...

1506
02:22:34,963 --> 02:22:38,633
...set you down on your bed now.
Here we go.

1507
02:22:56,651 --> 02:22:57,819
Well?

1508
02:22:59,654 --> 02:23:01,489
What about Mrs. Moores?

1509
02:23:03,575 --> 02:23:05,493
Was it like the mouse?

1510
02:23:06,828 --> 02:23:07,912
Was it...

1511
02:23:09,998 --> 02:23:14,502
-...you know, a miracle?
-Yes.

1512
02:23:15,670 --> 02:23:17,839
Yes, it was.

1513
02:23:18,381 --> 02:23:19,507
Damn.

1514
02:23:35,190 --> 02:23:36,858
Now...

1515
02:23:37,025 --> 02:23:39,694
...I want to talk, not shout.

1516
02:23:39,944 --> 02:23:42,447
I take that tape off,
you gonna be calm?

1517
02:23:42,906 --> 02:23:44,491
Mm-hmm.

1518
02:23:45,450 --> 02:23:48,620
My mother always says you do it fast,
it won't hurt so much.

1519
02:23:49,287 --> 02:23:52,040
Mmm! Mmm!

1520
02:23:52,415 --> 02:23:54,125
Guess she was wrong.

1521
02:23:57,378 --> 02:23:58,922
Let me out of this nut-coat.

1522
02:23:59,130 --> 02:24:00,465
-In a minute.
-Now!

1523
02:24:00,715 --> 02:24:02,509
Right now! I want out now--! Aah!

1524
02:24:06,971 --> 02:24:08,973
Shut up and listen.

1525
02:24:09,724 --> 02:24:13,645
You deserved to be punished for what
you did to Del. Accept it like a man.

1526
02:24:14,395 --> 02:24:18,024
Or else we'll make you sorry
you were ever born. We'll tell people...

1527
02:24:18,191 --> 02:24:21,820
-...how you sabotaged Del's execution...
-Sabotaged?

1528
02:24:22,028 --> 02:24:26,241
...how you pissed yourself like
a frightened little girl. Yes, we will talk.

1529
02:24:27,408 --> 02:24:28,910
But, Percy...

1530
02:24:29,577 --> 02:24:31,579
...you mind me, now.

1531
02:24:31,996 --> 02:24:36,084
We'll also see you beaten
within an inch of your life.

1532
02:24:37,585 --> 02:24:38,837
We know people too.

1533
02:24:40,338 --> 02:24:42,590
Are you so foolish,
you don't realize that?

1534
02:24:45,176 --> 02:24:48,263
Let bygones be bygones, hmm?

1535
02:24:49,264 --> 02:24:51,933
Nothing's hurt so far but your pride.

1536
02:24:52,350 --> 02:24:56,521
No one ever need know about that,
except the people in this little room.

1537
02:24:56,938 --> 02:25:00,441
What happens on the Mile
stays on the Mile.

1538
02:25:01,484 --> 02:25:02,861
Always has.

1539
02:25:07,198 --> 02:25:08,783
Hmm.

1540
02:25:12,036 --> 02:25:14,539
May I be let out of this coat now?

1541
02:25:34,475 --> 02:25:35,643
My things?

1542
02:25:38,730 --> 02:25:40,815
Think it over, Percy.

1543
02:25:41,566 --> 02:25:43,401
Oh, I intend to.

1544
02:25:44,319 --> 02:25:47,405
I intend to think it over very hard.

1545
02:25:49,157 --> 02:25:51,075
Starting right now.

1546
02:26:00,668 --> 02:26:04,047
He'll talk. Sooner or later.

1547
02:26:18,436 --> 02:26:20,647
-Hey, let him go!
-John, let go!

1548
02:26:20,855 --> 02:26:23,983
-Let go, John!
-John, goddamn it! Let him go!

1549
02:26:24,192 --> 02:26:25,944
Let go, John! No!

1550
02:26:26,986 --> 02:26:28,529
-Aah!
-Back off!

1551
02:26:28,780 --> 02:26:32,450
-John, stop it! Stop it, John!
-Let him go! Back off!

1552
02:26:32,659 --> 02:26:33,701
John, let him go!

1553
02:26:49,717 --> 02:26:51,219
Oh, my God!

1554
02:27:34,679 --> 02:27:37,432
Easy, now. Easy.

1555
02:27:38,683 --> 02:27:40,101
Easy.

1556
02:27:41,352 --> 02:27:42,770
Hey.

1557
02:27:46,524 --> 02:27:47,567
Percy.

1558
02:27:50,570 --> 02:27:51,696
Are you all right?

1559
02:28:24,896 --> 02:28:26,981
Boy, what you looking at?

1560
02:28:34,822 --> 02:28:38,493
What you looking at? You limp noodle.

1561
02:28:38,826 --> 02:28:42,997
You wanna kiss my ass?
You wanna suck my dick?

1562
02:28:55,760 --> 02:28:56,928
No!

1563
02:29:04,477 --> 02:29:06,687
Grab the gun! Grab the gun!

1564
02:29:12,944 --> 02:29:14,695
No, no.

1565
02:29:14,862 --> 02:29:16,864
No, no.

1566
02:29:17,490 --> 02:29:19,200
Oh, no.

1567
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:11,586
I punished them bad men.

1568
02:30:12,086 --> 02:30:13,838
I punished them both.

1569
02:30:14,088 --> 02:30:15,339
Why?

1570
02:30:16,257 --> 02:30:17,508
Why Wild Bill?

1571
02:30:18,843 --> 02:30:23,097
I saw in his heart
when he grabbed my arm.

1572
02:30:24,098 --> 02:30:25,933
I saw what Wild Billy had done.

1573
02:30:26,601 --> 02:30:28,936
Saw it plain as day.

1574
02:30:30,104 --> 02:30:32,940
You can't hide what's in your heart.

1575
02:30:33,274 --> 02:30:34,442
What?

1576
02:30:36,277 --> 02:30:37,445
You saw what?

1577
02:30:41,324 --> 02:30:43,451
Take my hand, boss.

1578
02:30:46,579 --> 02:30:48,331
You see for yourself.

1579
02:30:50,333 --> 02:30:51,876
Paul...

1580
02:30:52,043 --> 02:30:53,127
...NO.

1581
02:30:57,131 --> 02:30:58,549
Please.

1582
02:31:06,974 --> 02:31:08,643
No, no.

1583
02:31:09,936 --> 02:31:12,647
-Please.
-I gots to, boss.

1584
02:31:12,813 --> 02:31:15,316
I gots to give you
a little bit of myself.

1585
02:31:16,984 --> 02:31:18,486
A gift.

1586
02:31:19,820 --> 02:31:23,991
A gift of what's inside of me
SO you can see for yourself.

1587
02:31:37,255 --> 02:31:39,298
Paul!

1588
02:32:18,004 --> 02:32:19,922
Klaus!

1589
02:32:21,882 --> 02:32:23,384
Suppertime!

1590
02:32:23,551 --> 02:32:25,469
Bring the girls.

1591
02:32:28,931 --> 02:32:31,892
Girls! You heard your mama!

1592
02:32:32,727 --> 02:32:35,479
Yes, Papa! We're coming!

1593
02:32:53,831 --> 02:32:57,585
Come on, Billy.
I worked you enough for one day.

1594
02:32:57,752 --> 02:32:59,462
Come get you some supper.

1595
02:33:02,423 --> 02:33:06,594
God is great, God is good,
and we thank you...

1596
02:33:30,993 --> 02:33:32,703
You love your sister?

1597
02:33:32,870 --> 02:33:35,748
You make any noise,
you know what happens?

1598
02:33:35,956 --> 02:33:38,042
I'm gonna kill her instead of you.

1599
02:33:38,292 --> 02:33:41,796
You make any noise,
I'm gonna kill her. You understand?

1600
02:33:42,004 --> 02:33:43,631
You understand?

1601
02:33:44,215 --> 02:33:45,925
Shh.

1602
02:34:02,149 --> 02:34:06,153
He killed them with they love,
they love for each other.

1603
02:34:07,321 --> 02:34:09,657
Now you see how it is.

1604
02:34:11,033 --> 02:34:13,911
That's the way it is every day.

1605
02:34:14,161 --> 02:34:18,332
That's the way it is
all over the world.

1606
02:34:28,551 --> 02:34:29,677
Percy.

1607
02:34:29,844 --> 02:34:31,053
Percy Wetmore.

1608
02:34:32,012 --> 02:34:35,349
-Son?
-Percy. Percy Wetmore.

1609
02:34:36,058 --> 02:34:37,351
Son?

1610
02:34:38,018 --> 02:34:41,021
-Son, can you hear me?
-Speak up if you can hear us.

1611
02:34:42,022 --> 02:34:45,067
I think this boy's cheese
slid off his cracker.

1612
02:34:46,861 --> 02:34:49,780
Percy, I got to ask you
a few questions.

1613
02:34:50,030 --> 02:34:53,284
That's right. One minute,
he was fine, and the next, blammo.

1614
02:34:53,534 --> 02:34:55,870
Dirty bastard grabbed him
through the bars.

1615
02:34:56,120 --> 02:34:58,706
Scared the boy so bad, he wet hisself.

1616
02:34:59,707 --> 02:35:02,585
See, we didn't even see it happen.

1617
02:35:06,547 --> 02:35:09,884
I'll cover for you as much as I can...

1618
02:35:10,092 --> 02:35:12,386
...even if it means my job.

1619
02:35:13,053 --> 02:35:15,055
But I have to know...

1620
02:35:15,222 --> 02:35:18,851
...does this have anything to do
with what happened at my house?

1621
02:35:21,395 --> 02:35:22,897
Does it, Paul?

1622
02:35:24,899 --> 02:35:26,108
No.

1623
02:36:53,487 --> 02:36:57,324
Does Hal know?
That Coffey's innocent, I mean.

1624
02:36:58,576 --> 02:37:00,327
Well, can he help?

1625
02:37:00,828 --> 02:37:03,664
Does he have the influence to do
something about this?

1626
02:37:03,831 --> 02:37:06,667
-Stop the execution?
-No.

1627
02:37:09,837 --> 02:37:11,338
Then don't tell him.

1628
02:37:12,006 --> 02:37:14,258
If it can't help, don't tell him.

1629
02:37:14,592 --> 02:37:15,843
Ever.

1630
02:37:18,220 --> 02:37:19,680
I won't.

1631
02:37:31,358 --> 02:37:33,736
There's no way out of this for you,
is there?

1632
02:37:35,237 --> 02:37:36,530
No.

1633
02:37:37,615 --> 02:37:40,200
And I've been thinking about it,
believe me.

1634
02:37:40,367 --> 02:37:45,039
I've been running it through my head
any number of ways. No.

1635
02:37:46,123 --> 02:37:48,250
I'll tell you the truth, honey.

1636
02:37:49,793 --> 02:37:54,632
I've done some things in my life
that I am not proud of...

1637
02:37:55,215 --> 02:38:00,054
...but this is the first time
I've ever felt real danger of hell.

1638
02:38:01,055 --> 02:38:02,389
Hell?

1639
02:38:04,141 --> 02:38:05,976
Oh, Paul.

1640
02:38:08,312 --> 02:38:09,897
Talk to him.

1641
02:38:11,065 --> 02:38:12,900
Talk to John.

1642
02:38:14,735 --> 02:38:16,779
Find out what he wants.

1643
02:38:33,671 --> 02:38:34,922
Hello, boss.

1644
02:38:35,923 --> 02:38:37,257
Hello, John.

1645
02:38:38,676 --> 02:38:41,553
I guess you know
we're coming down to it now.

1646
02:38:41,845 --> 02:38:43,597
Another couple of days.

1647
02:38:57,111 --> 02:38:59,947
Is there anything special
you wanna eat that night?

1648
02:39:00,322 --> 02:39:02,616
We can rustle you up most anything.

1649
02:39:12,960 --> 02:39:17,631
Meat loaf be nice.
Mashed taters, gravy.

1650
02:39:17,881 --> 02:39:19,299
Okra.

1651
02:39:20,384 --> 02:39:23,220
Maybe some of that fine corn bread
your missus make...

1652
02:39:24,054 --> 02:39:26,140
...if she don't mind.

1653
02:39:28,434 --> 02:39:29,852
Now...

1654
02:39:30,352 --> 02:39:35,274
...what about a preacher?
Someone to say a little prayer with.

1655
02:39:35,482 --> 02:39:37,651
Don't want no preacher.

1656
02:39:38,652 --> 02:39:41,155
You can say a prayer, if you like.

1657
02:39:41,864 --> 02:39:43,157
Me?

1658
02:39:45,993 --> 02:39:48,829
Suppose I could, if it came to that.

1659
02:39:52,916 --> 02:39:54,460
John...

1660
02:39:57,004 --> 02:39:59,840
I have to ask you something
very important now.

1661
02:40:01,508 --> 02:40:03,677
I know what you gonna say.

1662
02:40:04,178 --> 02:40:05,679
You don't have to say it.

1663
02:40:06,013 --> 02:40:09,349
No, I do. I do. I have to say it.

1664
02:40:10,392 --> 02:40:11,810
John...

1665
02:40:13,270 --> 02:40:15,606
...tell me what you want me to do.

1666
02:40:16,523 --> 02:40:18,525
You want me to take you out of here?

1667
02:40:19,693 --> 02:40:23,697
Just let you run away?
See how far you could get?

1668
02:40:25,199 --> 02:40:27,910
Why would you do
such a foolish thing?

1669
02:40:29,912 --> 02:40:32,539
On the day of my judgment...

1670
02:40:32,873 --> 02:40:35,042
...when I stand before God...

1671
02:40:35,209 --> 02:40:39,046
...and he asks me why did I...

1672
02:40:39,296 --> 02:40:41,924
Did I kill one of his true...

1673
02:40:42,800 --> 02:40:44,384
...miracles...

1674
02:40:45,552 --> 02:40:47,721
...what am I going to say?

1675
02:40:48,639 --> 02:40:50,390
That it was my job?

1676
02:40:52,559 --> 02:40:54,561
It's my job.

1677
02:40:54,853 --> 02:40:59,483
You tell God the Father
it was a kindness you done.

1678
02:41:02,569 --> 02:41:05,239
I know you're hurting and worrying.

1679
02:41:05,906 --> 02:41:09,576
I can feel it on you.
But you ought to quit on it now.

1680
02:41:10,744 --> 02:41:13,747
I want it to be over and done with.

1681
02:41:14,414 --> 02:41:15,916
I do.

1682
02:41:20,337 --> 02:41:22,339
I'm tired, boss.

1683
02:41:23,757 --> 02:41:28,095
Tired of being on the road,
lonely as a sparrow in the rain.

1684
02:41:29,263 --> 02:41:32,099
I'm tired of never having me
a buddy to be with...

1685
02:41:32,599 --> 02:41:37,271
...to tell me where we's going to,
coming from, or why.

1686
02:41:38,105 --> 02:41:42,276
Mostly, I'm tired of people
being ugly to each other.

1687
02:41:43,443 --> 02:41:47,406
I'm tired of all the pain
I feel and hear in the world...

1688
02:41:47,614 --> 02:41:49,283
...every day.

1689
02:41:49,616 --> 02:41:51,618
There's too much of it.

1690
02:41:51,952 --> 02:41:55,789
It's like pieces of glass
in my head...

1691
02:41:55,998 --> 02:41:58,292
...all the time.

1692
02:41:59,793 --> 02:42:01,795
Can you understand?

1693
02:42:04,798 --> 02:42:07,759
Yes, John, I think I can.

1694
02:42:10,137 --> 02:42:13,515
Well, there must be something
we can do for you, John.

1695
02:42:15,642 --> 02:42:17,728
There must be something
that you want.

1696
02:42:27,154 --> 02:42:31,658
I ain't never seen me a flicker show.

1697
02:42:32,159 --> 02:42:34,286
Heaven

1698
02:42:34,494 --> 02:42:36,663
I'm in heaven

1699
02:42:37,539 --> 02:42:43,170
And my heart beats so
That I can hardly speak

1700
02:42:44,171 --> 02:42:50,177
And I seem to find
The happiness I seek

1701
02:42:50,677 --> 02:42:56,558
When we're out together
Dancing cheek to cheek

1702
02:43:57,577 --> 02:43:59,997
Why, they's angels.

1703
02:44:00,914 --> 02:44:03,583
Angels, just like up in heaven.

1704
02:45:04,227 --> 02:45:06,229
I'll be all right, fellas.

1705
02:45:07,647 --> 02:45:09,900
This here's the hard part.

1706
02:45:11,193 --> 02:45:12,736
I'll be all right in a while.

1707
02:45:13,820 --> 02:45:18,408
John, I should have this just for now.

1708
02:45:22,412 --> 02:45:24,831
I'll give it back after.

1709
02:45:28,001 --> 02:45:32,506
You know, I fell asleep this afternoon
and had me a dream.

1710
02:45:33,715 --> 02:45:35,842
I dreamed about Del's mouse.

1711
02:45:37,010 --> 02:45:38,220
Did you, John?

1712
02:45:39,012 --> 02:45:43,350
I dreamed Mr. Jingles got down to
that place Boss Howell talked about.

1713
02:45:43,600 --> 02:45:45,852
That Mouseville place.

1714
02:45:46,186 --> 02:45:48,522
I dreamed there's kids.

1715
02:45:49,022 --> 02:45:52,526
And how they laughed
at his tricks. My!

1716
02:45:55,028 --> 02:45:58,824
I dreamed that those two little
blond-headed girls was there.

1717
02:45:59,032 --> 02:46:00,867
They's laughing too.

1718
02:46:01,034 --> 02:46:04,037
I put my arms around them
and set them on my knees.

1719
02:46:04,246 --> 02:46:08,291
And they was no blood coming out
of they hair, and they's just fine.

1720
02:46:08,542 --> 02:46:11,878
We all watched Mr. Jingles
roll that spool.

1721
02:46:13,380 --> 02:46:16,800
How we did laugh.
Fit to bust, we was!

1722
02:46:32,566 --> 02:46:34,401
John.

1723
02:46:35,068 --> 02:46:40,073
They's lots of folks here
that hate me. Lots!

1724
02:46:41,074 --> 02:46:43,076
I can feel it.

1725
02:46:43,326 --> 02:46:45,078
It's like bees stinging me.

1726
02:46:45,412 --> 02:46:47,789
Well, feel how we feel, then.

1727
02:46:49,082 --> 02:46:50,292
We don't hate you.

1728
02:46:51,668 --> 02:46:53,253
Can you feel that?

1729
02:46:55,422 --> 02:46:57,591
Kill him twice, you boys!

1730
02:46:58,425 --> 02:47:02,429
You go on and kill that raping
baby killer twice!

1731
02:47:02,596 --> 02:47:04,431
That'd be fine!

1732
02:47:21,114 --> 02:47:23,617
Wipe your face before
you stand up, Dean.

1733
02:47:23,825 --> 02:47:25,118
Yes, sir.

1734
02:47:37,380 --> 02:47:38,465
Roll on one.

1735
02:47:46,473 --> 02:47:49,976
Does it hurt yet? I hope it does.

1736
02:47:50,810 --> 02:47:53,063
I hope it hurts like hell.

1737
02:47:54,981 --> 02:47:59,069
John Coffey, you've been condemned to
die in the chair by a jury of your peers.

1738
02:47:59,319 --> 02:48:02,864
Sentence imposed by a judge
in good standing in this state.

1739
02:48:03,156 --> 02:48:06,409
Do you have anything to say
before sentence is carried out?

1740
02:48:08,161 --> 02:48:10,664
I'm sorry for what I am.

1741
02:48:22,676 --> 02:48:24,427
Please, boss...

1742
02:48:25,845 --> 02:48:28,515
...don't put that thing over my face.

1743
02:48:29,683 --> 02:48:32,018
Don't put me in the dark.

1744
02:48:32,852 --> 02:48:35,188
I's afraid of the dark.

1745
02:48:44,864 --> 02:48:46,533
All right, John.

1746
02:49:06,720 --> 02:49:09,723
Heaven, I'm in heaven

1747
02:49:09,931 --> 02:49:12,726
Heaven, heaven

1748
02:49:12,976 --> 02:49:14,811
I'm in heaven

1749
02:49:15,395 --> 02:49:17,981
Heaven, heaven

1750
02:49:18,231 --> 02:49:19,941
I'm in heaven

1751
02:49:20,442 --> 02:49:23,820
Heaven, heaven

1752
02:49:23,903 --> 02:49:25,905
I'm in heaven

1753
02:49:25,989 --> 02:49:27,907
I'm in heaven

1754
02:49:27,991 --> 02:49:29,993
I'm in heaven

1755
02:49:30,076 --> 02:49:33,955
Heaven, heaven

1756
02:49:40,837 --> 02:49:42,464
John Coffey...

1757
02:49:43,465 --> 02:49:46,593
...electricity shall pass through
your body until you are dead...

1758
02:49:46,760 --> 02:49:48,970
...in accordance with state law.

1759
02:49:51,348 --> 02:49:55,101
May God have mercy on your soul.

1760
02:50:29,427 --> 02:50:30,637
Paul.

1761
02:50:33,807 --> 02:50:35,725
You have to say it.

1762
02:50:37,394 --> 02:50:39,646
You have to give the order.

1763
02:50:57,664 --> 02:50:59,999
He killed them with they love.

1764
02:51:00,166 --> 02:51:05,046
That's how it is every day
all over the world.

1765
02:51:18,852 --> 02:51:20,270
Roll on two.

1766
02:53:04,958 --> 02:53:08,294
It was the last execution
I ever took part in.

1767
02:53:08,628 --> 02:53:12,298
I just couldn't do it anymore
after that. Brutal either.

1768
02:53:13,466 --> 02:53:18,221
We both transferred out,
took jobs with Boys' Correctional.

1769
02:53:18,471 --> 02:53:20,223
It was all right.

1770
02:53:20,807 --> 02:53:23,810
"Catch them young"
became my motto.

1771
02:53:26,980 --> 02:53:28,189
You don't believe me.

1772
02:53:28,982 --> 02:53:31,568
I don't imagine you'd lie to me, Paul.

1773
02:53:32,318 --> 02:53:34,487
-It's just that--
-It's quite a story.

1774
02:53:34,737 --> 02:53:36,990
It's quite a story.

1775
02:53:37,323 --> 02:53:39,742
One thing I don't understand.

1776
02:53:39,993 --> 02:53:41,744
You said you and Jan...

1777
02:53:41,995 --> 02:53:45,498
...had a grown son in 1935.

1778
02:53:45,832 --> 02:53:47,333
Is that right?

1779
02:53:47,709 --> 02:53:49,669
The math doesn't work, does it?

1780
02:53:55,174 --> 02:53:57,927
Do you feel up to taking a walk?

1781
02:54:18,656 --> 02:54:20,033
Watch your step.

1782
02:54:20,533 --> 02:54:22,869
Now let your eyes adjust.

1783
02:54:34,547 --> 02:54:35,757
There.

1784
02:54:38,384 --> 02:54:41,262
Hey. Wake up, old fella.

1785
02:54:41,554 --> 02:54:42,805
Wake up.

1786
02:54:46,392 --> 02:54:50,271
Paul, it isn't. It can't be.

1787
02:54:54,400 --> 02:54:55,777
Come over here, boy.

1788
02:54:56,277 --> 02:54:58,655
Come on over here and see this lady.

1789
02:55:01,574 --> 02:55:04,577
That can't be Mr. Jingles.

1790
02:55:27,266 --> 02:55:29,852
Go on, you can do it.

1791
02:55:36,943 --> 02:55:41,447
This isn't exactly the Mouseville
we had in mind, is it?

1792
02:55:42,198 --> 02:55:46,119
But we make do. Don't we, old fella?

1793
02:55:52,625 --> 02:55:56,295
I think Mr. Jingles
happened by accident.

1794
02:55:56,713 --> 02:56:01,592
I think when we electrocuted Del,
and it all went so badly...

1795
02:56:01,801 --> 02:56:04,137
...well, John could feel that,
you know.

1796
02:56:04,387 --> 02:56:07,807
And I think a part of...

1797
02:56:07,974 --> 02:56:10,810
...whatever magic was inside of him...

1798
02:56:10,977 --> 02:56:14,313
...just leapt into my tiny friend here.

1799
02:56:15,481 --> 02:56:17,483
As for me...

1800
02:56:18,651 --> 02:56:21,154
...John had to give me
a part of himself...

1801
02:56:21,487 --> 02:56:23,656
...a gift, the way he saw it...

1802
02:56:23,990 --> 02:56:27,410
...So that I could see for myself
what Wild Bill had done.

1803
02:56:29,829 --> 02:56:31,998
When John did that...

1804
02:56:33,499 --> 02:56:35,835
...when he took my hand...

1805
02:56:36,836 --> 02:56:40,673
...a part of the power
that worked through him...

1806
02:56:41,674 --> 02:56:43,509
...Spilled into me.

1807
02:56:43,885 --> 02:56:45,678
He what?

1808
02:56:46,179 --> 02:56:49,682
He infected you with life?

1809
02:56:51,267 --> 02:56:53,603
It's as good a word as any.

1810
02:56:55,104 --> 02:56:58,024
He infected us both,
didn't he, Mr. Jingles?

1811
02:56:58,191 --> 02:56:59,692
With life.

1812
02:57:03,696 --> 02:57:06,866
I'm 108 years old, Elaine.

1813
02:57:07,033 --> 02:57:11,454
I was 44 the year that John Coffey
walked the Green Mile.

1814
02:57:14,373 --> 02:57:18,127
You mustn't blame John.
He couldn't help what happened.

1815
02:57:18,377 --> 02:57:22,924
He was just a force of nature.

1816
02:57:23,382 --> 02:57:27,553
Oh, I've lived to see
some amazing things, Ellie.

1817
02:57:28,554 --> 02:57:31,557
Another century come to pass.

1818
02:57:31,808 --> 02:57:33,684
But I've...

1819
02:57:34,310 --> 02:57:38,731
I've had to see my friends and
loved ones die off through the years.

1820
02:57:39,148 --> 02:57:41,234
Hal and Melinda...

1821
02:57:41,651 --> 02:57:43,069
...Brutus Howell...

1822
02:57:43,236 --> 02:57:45,947
...my wife, my boy.

1823
02:57:48,908 --> 02:57:50,743
And you, Elaine.

1824
02:57:51,744 --> 02:57:53,579
You'll die too.

1825
02:57:55,081 --> 02:57:59,460
And my curse is knowing
that I'll be there to see it.

1826
02:58:00,920 --> 02:58:03,339
It's my atonement, you see.

1827
02:58:03,923 --> 02:58:05,591
It's my punishment...

1828
02:58:05,842 --> 02:58:08,469
...for letting John Coffey
ride the lightning.

1829
02:58:10,179 --> 02:58:12,974
For killing a miracle of God.

1830
02:58:14,475 --> 02:58:17,270
Almighty, everlasting God...

1831
02:58:17,562 --> 02:58:19,939
...the source of all being and life...

1832
02:58:20,106 --> 02:58:22,525
You'll be gone like all the others.

1833
02:58:22,692 --> 02:58:24,485
I'll have to stay.

1834
02:58:26,487 --> 02:58:30,700
Oh, I'll die eventually.
Of that I'm sure.

1835
02:58:31,450 --> 02:58:35,454
I have no illusions of immortality.

1836
02:58:35,788 --> 02:58:38,416
But I will have wished for death...

1837
02:58:38,583 --> 02:58:41,210
...long before death finds me.

1838
02:58:42,295 --> 02:58:46,132
In truth, I wish for it already.

1839
02:58:58,227 --> 02:59:00,229
Mr. Jingles?

1840
02:59:09,155 --> 02:59:11,324
Where you been?

1841
02:59:11,657 --> 02:59:15,077
Been worried about you, boy.
You hungry?

1842
02:59:15,912 --> 02:59:18,331
Let's go see if we can't find you
something to eat.

1843
02:59:19,498 --> 02:59:23,169
A few crumbs anyway.
I know you'd like that.

1844
02:59:24,670 --> 02:59:26,005
Look at you.

1845
02:59:27,673 --> 02:59:31,594
I lie in bed most nights
thinking about it.

1846
02:59:31,802 --> 02:59:33,846
And I wait.

1847
02:59:34,555 --> 02:59:37,475
I think about all the people
I've loved...

1848
02:59:37,683 --> 02:59:39,852
...now long gone.

1849
02:59:40,353 --> 02:59:43,022
I think about my beautiful Jan...

1850
02:59:43,189 --> 02:59:46,192
...how [ lost her so many years ago.

1851
02:59:47,610 --> 02:59:52,198
And I think about all of us walking
our own Green Mile...

1852
02:59:52,448 --> 02:59:55,117
...each in our own time.

1853
02:59:56,202 --> 02:59:59,372
But one thought
more than any other...

1854
02:59:59,580 --> 03:00:02,208
...keeps me awake most nights:

1855
03:00:03,376 --> 03:00:07,380
If he could make a mouse
live so long...

1856
03:00:07,713 --> 03:00:10,883
...how much longer do I have?

1857
03:00:14,220 --> 03:00:17,014
We each owe a death.

1858
03:00:17,223 --> 03:00:19,725
There are no exceptions.

1859
03:00:20,476 --> 03:00:22,478
But, oh, God...

1860
03:00:23,396 --> 03:00:25,189
...sometimes...

1861
03:00:25,731 --> 03:00:29,402
...the Green Mile seems so long.
