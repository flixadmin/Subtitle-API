1
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,371
This story begun since
the abnormal rohit borned..

2
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:27,077
he grew up with the time,
but his brain remain like a kid.

3
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:31,521
and his habits, mischief,
and talking remained like kid..

4
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:36,386
Then rohit's innocence
got punished...

5
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,514
everybody makes fun of me...

6
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:43,481
if you won't help me,
so who else will

7
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:46,828
you've so much power...

8
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:50,448
Oh God give me a little bit power to me..

9
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,083
and one night on the land of kasoli

10
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:58,982
an space ship landed..

11
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,012
rohit got the magic..

12
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:03,717
the life started smiling..

13
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:07,317
the powers from the magic
changed the rohit completely

14
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:10,486
rohit's fame crossed the borders.

15
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:17,434
One day a great scientist called
rohit to singapore sidhant arya

16
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:26,545
then suddenly sonia leaved
the rohit's hand...

17
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,148
they found the cause for
living in rohit's son krishna.

18
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:33,276
but his amazing powers..

19
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:35,486
scared sonia mishra that...

20
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:38,950
she took away krishna
and started living on strange place

21
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,086
but destiny choosed the
way of heart..

22
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:44,426
krishna went to singapore
for meeting priya..

23
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:50,195
where the truth was waiting
the his father rohit is alive.

24
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:54,065
and is host-aged by
the dr. arya..

25
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:58,210
then time sent that son
a new history

26
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:01,469
the fire of a circus
made him wear a mask..

27
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:04,610
like that we got new protector..

28
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,080
new friend..
an super hero..

29
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,001
Kaal's experiment is successful

30
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:45,377
now spreading this virus
in every corner of the world...

31
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:51,247
will start the destruction
of human being..

32
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,597
now i understand the secret of
the powers of sunlight you gets.

33
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:18,910
if my experiment will successful,
so this world will get new beginning.

34
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,512
10 min remaining.

35
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:37,623
father you,
is everything all right?

36
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:40,288
i'm fine...

37
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:43,295
i'm very happy today, father?

38
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,465
sorry l woke you up,
but 9 min are remaining in raising sun

39
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:50,574
so lets go to lab ..

40
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:58,978
whatever lacking was in
formation, l fixed them up.

41
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,057
what's all this father?

42
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:18,931
my hard work for years..

43
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:20,833
an try..

44
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,839
the sunlight gives it a energy.

45
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:28,673
and l think i finally by the mirrors...

46
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:30,915
by reflecting the lights energy..

47
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,646
i've made the perfect
combination for multiply it.

48
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:36,787
there's a natural combination exist.

49
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,387
but we can't see it.

50
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:46,130
its actually a electronic device..

51
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:50,297
if there is magical combination
around this pen..

52
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,170
so this pen will be activate..

53
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:53,931
and will start beeping.

54
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:59,344
then it will gather all the
rays and put them in subject.

55
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:03,409
then we'll be able to see
who the sunlight gives the life.

56
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,212
means, the sunlight will
put the soul in this dead plant?

57
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:10,915
how come it possible?

58
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:15,819
it is possible..

59
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:23,226
sun..

60
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:43,544
pen has been activated.

61
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:47,817
its mean the formation is correct.

62
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,147
energy's power is too high.

63
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,522
have to do something.

64
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:34,764
have to make filter who let
the pass light which is needed

65
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:37,631
and observe the remaining
energy itself..

66
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:47,438
filter with brain..

67
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:51,676
i'll make it..
then see it..

68
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:55,378
my experiment will
change the solar energy direction

69
00:10:58,524 --> 00:10:59,924
now lets go ..
have to go to office.

70
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,218

129
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,019
tall in fight, and then small

130
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:57,522
you can't understand..

131
00:15:58,157 --> 00:15:59,988
this is the style
of we super man people..

132
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,652
you're a common man,
so you do one thing..

133
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:05,128
find the work
which you can do easily

134
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,827
the big news from mumbai.

135
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:13,862
the plane's front wheels
has been jammed.

136
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,102
the pilot's every attempt
was unsuccessful for open it.

137
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:22,209
if the landing would not go properly,
so plane can be crashed.

138
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:26,647
the all passenger are in danger.

139
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:29,550
have to go now..

140
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:32,882
where he's gone?

141
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:52,967
landing without front wheels..

142
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:56,044
plane can be explode..

143
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:57,910
we don’t have another option

144
00:16:58,817 --> 00:16:59,841
fuel is about finish

145
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,434
will something happened to us?

146

the dangerous virus has created
a panic in Namibia...

147
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:32,014
you must have heard
about it..yes we were seeing it.

148
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:34,598
in how much time the virus
starts reacting?

149
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:44,054
after coming in contact,
its symptom shows up in 5 min.

150
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:48,525
this virus is spreading by
the air and water..

151
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:52,803
we've sent the blood sample
of infected people around the world.

152
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:53,702
have sent you too

153
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,231
that you can crack this virus..

154
00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:00,000
therefore you're my last hope.

155
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:03,837
i'll try my best..

156
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:24,194
i want to meet you right now.

00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:11,344
unique..

166
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,948
because i had no past..

167
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:18,456
only present..

168
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:22,319
whoever you are,
came to wrong place..

169
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,756
place is right, and time too

170
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:28,655
intentions are maybe wrong.

171
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,507
first you know me..

172
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:41,211
i'm the answer of your
every question.

173
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:42,671

174
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:45,508
in my eyes..

175
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:47,813
to yourself..

176
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:38,664
that you agree to meet me.

177
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:42,868
you wanted to tell me
something about the virus..

178
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:45,035
take this..

179
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:50,579
it contain the virus sample,
and its anti dot..

180
00:25:56,521 --> 00:26:02,892
this company makes the anti dot..

181
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:09,194
and l recently know that it makes
the anti dot later..

182
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:11,496
first it makes the virus..

183
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:14,161
they've many labs in the world..

184
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:19,505
therefore l've collected the full
proofs against them..

185
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:28,682
you were in-charge for lab no.3

186
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:35,925
were you had to make the different
DNA's fusion..

187
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,194
but you made these files..

188
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:43,923
how'd you know.

189
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:48,134
i'm saying right..

190
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:02,079
you made mistake to cheat with him

191
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:30,178
its a miracle of science.

192
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:37,184
this was made by the person
who's making his strange world.

193
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,428
this is kaal

194
00:27:46,631 --> 00:27:50,397
having wit for get over
on the time and life

195
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:52,665
an secret.

196
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:55,834
science's an genius.

197
00:27:57,409 --> 00:28:01,869
this research can change
the whole world..

198
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:12,312
but he started experiment
for changing himself.

199
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:20,194
we can see it strange
coincidence the who has power in brain

200
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:24,233
his trunk below the neck
is soulless

201
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:28,569
but leaving 2 fingers of hand.

202
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:32,242
its hard to believe...
but its truth

203
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,807
kaal with telekinesis..

204
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,774
means getting his brain
powers in two fingers.

205
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:42,244
can pick up things
and fly them..

206
00:28:42,787 --> 00:28:43,719
and can break them

207
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,219
even then his finding..

208
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:51,558
so he can find that bone marrow
which can put soul in hi body

209
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:59,896
when different DNA kaal
couldn't find the cure in humans..

210
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:03,472
then he selected the animals
for his experiment.

211
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:08,074
and mixing his and
the animal’s blood dna..

212
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:12,274
kaal made the strange creature..

213
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,344
whose soul belongs to kaal.

214
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,044
the face is of human.

215
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:19,816
and habit and strength
is of animals..

216
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:23,321
the kaal named them

217
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:25,054
animal..

218
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:28,594
but kaal couldn't get that
bone marrow from manima..

219
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:30,759
of he's looking for.

220
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:34,204
his struggle is still on.

221
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:37,085
start the final test

222
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:16,791
teach them living here

223
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:20,600
and carry on finding and try

224
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:26,404
you'll find that bone marrow.

225
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:29,473
i'm successful too today.

226
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:34,346
you've not seen my new
manimal strikers tongue strike

227
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:40,983
and kaal was successful yesterday
when he made you

228
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,957
by his and chameleon’s blood

229
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:47,361
that's why you can
change the face and body

230
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,400
anywhere anytime

231
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:55,231
lets see how much people
are breathing in namibia..

232
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:08,082
this red dot shows that 40%
people are infected by this virus.

233
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:12,514
world many genius scientist
face is sad.

234
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:16,584
our scientist are asking,
when to send our anti dot there!

235
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:21,197
let the people die.

236
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:24,962
and let them afraid more.

237
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:35,839
as much people's courage will go down,
and our profit will go up

238
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,321
this virus hasn't born

239
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:47,017
it was made

240
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,527
who can do this!

241
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:52,721
an very sick person

242
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:58,867
we're successful to make
the anti dote of virus

243
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:03,339
an company named kaal pharma

244
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:05,270
anti dote reached to namibia.

245
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:07,074
and situation is under control

246
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:17,586
this antidote proved again,
there're more good people than bad

247
00:34:57,728 --> 00:34:58,854
there's nothing not afraid.

248
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:01,289
you're safe now.

249
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:05,859
now we both are safe

250
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,131

and l kept him away,
and couldn't see all this.

300

how much krishna fall before
he stand up on his feet.

301
00:47:04,721 --> 00:47:06,042
how much time he
could controlled.

302
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:08,070

00:48:58,001 --> 00:49:00,128
my whole body
would be fine so l..

316
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:04,864
you can't think..

317
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:08,171
what'd l do..

318
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,874
l still can't think ..
how can you do all this.

319
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:15,543
from where did you found these powers.

320
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:17,253
what's the secret of it?

321
00:49:18,155 --> 00:49:22,182
at last why having so much power,
this body is stucked in wheel chair

322
00:49:29,433 --> 00:49:30,161
its hurting me.

323
00:49:30,767 --> 00:49:31,529
it should be.

324
00:49:32,903 --> 00:49:34,768
because you hurt me.

325
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,006
after asking the question..

326
00:49:40,377 --> 00:49:41,935
which's answer l don’t know.

327
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:47,678
and still don’t know..

328
00:49:54,024 --> 00:49:55,184
what're you doing son?

329
00:49:57,094 --> 00:49:59,187
don’t miss use your powers.

330
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:02,960
whatever powers you've,
don’t hurt anyone by it..

331
00:50:04,201 --> 00:50:06,897
how many times i told you this.

332
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:10,940
so many times l asked you dad,
how come these powers are in me?

333
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:13,164
why l'm like that?

334
00:50:14,044 --> 00:50:16,877
i don’t know my son,
you always lied to me.

335
00:50:17,748 --> 00:50:19,238
and you're lying right now..

336
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:21,213
no..believe me..

337
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:08,864
spent millions.

338
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:10,996
will spend billions..

339
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:18,406
how much we earned
in namebia by our anti dot sell

340
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:26,408
little bit fear,
and 320 million dollars.

341
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:32,754
fear's business is the best business.

342
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:37,890
now we've to earn in billions.

343
00:51:39,329 --> 00:51:44,596
now we want the country for
our virus where is crores population

344
00:52:02,385 --> 00:52:04,512
india or china..

345
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:07,320
china's population is
more than india.

346
00:52:08,525 --> 00:52:11,085
but there's more population
of Gods in india..

347
00:52:12,362 --> 00:52:14,091
and their belief on them by people.

348
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:18,096
so lets see.

349
00:52:18,568 --> 00:52:24,529
can their only god can save
them from virus..?

350
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:26,364
or not..

351
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:04,499
i heard that you might feel
eating some sour.

352
00:54:05,976 --> 00:54:09,537

i want our baby sweet like you

353
00:54:17,487 --> 00:54:18,568
how you're licking ice cream

354
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:24,219

355
00:54:24,861 --> 00:54:26,954
when you want to eat it,
so why you brought me here.

356
00:54:32,502 --> 00:54:34,299
i couldn't eat mine,
so how can l eat yours..

357
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:36,371
lets buy new ice cream

358
00:54:38,842 --> 00:54:39,831
how're you

359
00:54:40,343 --> 00:54:43,335
i'm in tension,
trying to adjust my anger.

360
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:46,105
because i'm accused of
stealing ice cream

361
00:54:52,756 --> 00:54:53,557
what you want to eat

362
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:03,456
you're giving me empty cone

363
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,592
i had filled it..
so why its empty

364
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:08,366
i'm filling it before you,
okay fill it.

365
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:16,336
now you see l filled before you

366
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:18,644
yes you filled but its empty

367
00:55:20,183 --> 00:55:22,014
my ice cream..
i've just bought you

368
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:30,524
one more cone.

369
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:19,824
kaal, Mumbai’s color will
be change very soon

370
00:57:54,771 --> 00:57:57,205
as you're seeing everywhere is
the fear and tension

371
00:57:58,107 --> 00:58:01,270
its worse situation
is of the hospital.

372
00:58:01,945 --> 00:58:05,381
because of this rapid spreading virus,
people are in critical situation

373
00:58:05,915 --> 00:58:09,681
1 1 7 people died already,
and its number are increasing.

374
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:16,420
please get up papa.

375
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:56,919
my fear was right..

376
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:02,762
this is the same virus who killed
thousands in namebia.

377
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:08,790
but this virus's anti dot
has been created..

378
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:11,137
contact the kaal pharmaceutical..

379
01:00:21,751 --> 01:00:22,951
whatever happened with striker

380
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:26,086
after that it may be need
to try the krish.

381
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:29,456
our virus will test him too

382
01:00:31,694 --> 01:00:34,595
indian government's color
turned to white because of virus

383
01:00:36,032 --> 01:00:38,762
their fear is contacting
our dealers..

384
01:00:46,409 --> 01:00:48,809
the special anti dot decomponent is ready

385
01:00:49,412 --> 01:00:51,607
we should start making
anti dot as soon as possible.

386
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:54,814
how much time will our scientist
take to make it?

387
01:00:55,752 --> 01:00:56,650
10 days..

388
01:00:59,288 --> 01:01:00,889
this city will be destructed in 10 days.

389
01:01:02,558 --> 01:01:05,356
people are dying in front of me.

390
01:01:06,262 --> 01:01:07,354
i can hear their screams

391
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:09,624
and l can't do anything..

392
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:12,065
i can't do anything.

393
01:01:13,369 --> 01:01:14,930
so what's the meaning of
being my krish?

394
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:21,804
it has.

395
01:01:22,879 --> 01:01:26,315
everyone was infected,
but nothing happened to you

396
01:01:28,951 --> 01:01:32,079
priya is alright,
because she has your child in her stomach

397
01:01:34,891 --> 01:01:38,258
my all colleagues are infected

398
01:01:39,762 --> 01:01:40,694
leaving me.

399
01:01:42,832 --> 01:01:46,029
means, this virus can't infect us.

400
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:50,930
maybe there's something
in our blood.

401
01:01:51,474 --> 01:01:52,835
which is fighting with this virus.

402
01:01:53,476 --> 01:01:54,500
and is protecting us

403
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:32,447
you test on me.

404
01:03:42,952 --> 01:03:43,850
i'm all right..

405
01:03:48,357 --> 01:03:50,484
its mean..
the anti dot can be created by your blood.

406
01:03:52,128 --> 01:03:53,356
now we can save people..

407
01:03:54,263 --> 01:03:56,697
just in few hours,
the anti dot will be ready

408
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:03,366
but how fast to everyone..

409
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:05,580
we can send the medicine..

410
01:04:08,044 --> 01:04:09,272
how come its possible..

411
01:05:27,189 --> 01:05:29,885
don’t know how, but our virus
infection is reducing in mumbai.

412
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:39,290
someone in you all have betrayed me.

413
01:05:40,836 --> 01:05:42,428
has cheated kaal.

414
01:05:43,806 --> 01:05:48,140
i told you that anti dot shouldn't
reached to india before 10 days.

415
01:05:49,812 --> 01:05:50,938
so how come it reached there

416
01:05:53,983 --> 01:05:55,314
how sent that..

417
01:05:59,922 --> 01:06:05,019
we got news that an scientist of
mumbai has made the anti dot.

418
01:06:11,067 --> 01:06:15,834
how can a worlds any scientist can
make the kaal's virus anti dot.

419
01:06:22,511 --> 01:06:25,173
my virus's anti dot can be
made by only my dna..

420
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:28,139
by my blood.

421
01:06:29,585 --> 01:06:32,520
so how come they...

422
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:34,448

423
01:06:36,192 --> 01:06:37,591

my blood in someone
else veins.?

425
01:06:45,601 --> 01:06:47,159
how can it shed..

426
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:49,638
how?

427
01:07:10,764 --> 01:07:14,666
Mumbai never stops,
never afraid.. never loose

428
01:07:16,069 --> 01:07:19,800
our mumbai again proved
after defeating this virus.

429
01:07:20,574 --> 01:07:22,132
i'm saluting

430
01:07:22,676 --> 01:07:23,870
the endurance of this city

431
01:07:24,845 --> 01:07:26,210
mumbai and its spirit.

432
01:07:26,747 --> 01:07:28,442
to whom more than it..

433
01:07:29,016 --> 01:07:30,540
who's the real hero of this victory

434
01:07:31,752 --> 01:07:33,049
childs friend.

435
01:07:33,487 --> 01:07:34,385

which will become the new
identity of this city

443
01:07:54,708 --> 01:07:56,573

01:22:31,017 --> 01:22:36,956
you must know your father-in-law
made the anti dot of my virus.

490
01:22:37,890 --> 01:22:41,621
and must be know how he made it

491
01:22:43,362 --> 01:22:44,556
i don’t know it either.

492
01:22:45,097 --> 01:22:51,161
and l know that, l'll get the answer
from you of my every question

493
01:22:55,341 --> 01:22:59,971
my husband is finding me.

494
01:23:00,479 --> 01:23:02,470
who're being find ..
who're not in front.

495
01:23:03,583 --> 01:23:05,244
but you're in front of him

496
01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:09,313
here and there too

497
01:23:29,642 --> 01:23:30,301
lets go

498
01:23:45,157 --> 01:23:46,954
priya are you here
or somewhere else.

499
01:23:48,361 --> 01:23:49,487
i'm here.

500
01:23:50,363 --> 01:23:51,455
in front of you

501
01:23:53,032 --> 01:23:55,466
you're front of me
but not with me

502
01:23:56,535 --> 01:24:01,802
means if you'd with me,
you'd understand that l'm changed.

503
01:24:05,444 --> 01:24:06,706
hence i'm all yours.

504
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:10,415
as your channel entertain you..

505
01:24:11,117 --> 01:24:14,314
as like l'll entertain you

506
01:24:15,187 --> 01:24:18,179
daily list is ready,
from shopping to cinema..

507
01:24:18,958 --> 01:24:21,051
and l won't take any leave
or any promotion

508
01:24:21,494 --> 01:24:24,725
and want only salary..

509
01:24:25,865 --> 01:24:27,298
and some smiles in salary

510
01:24:28,434 --> 01:24:29,628
20 lac hugs.

511
01:24:30,803 --> 01:24:31,963
2 crore kisses.

512
01:24:37,009 --> 01:24:38,090
from where we should start.

513
01:24:39,812 --> 01:24:41,302
i was thinking it too

514
01:24:42,114 --> 01:24:43,195
from where we should start.

515
01:24:46,085 --> 01:24:50,818
forget whatever happened.

516
01:25:18,584 --> 01:25:21,485
his heart is beating once
in every 2 min.

517
01:25:22,321 --> 01:25:25,085
its mean..
he gone to hibernation

518
01:25:27,093 --> 01:25:31,553
in a sleep, he can live alive
as much he want in this heart rate.

519
01:25:33,065 --> 01:25:35,693
but any human can't do this

520
01:25:36,402 --> 01:25:38,029
but animals can do this

521
01:25:38,771 --> 01:25:39,465
they does it

522
01:25:40,072 --> 01:25:42,097
living under the earth,
and takes the breath

523
01:25:42,742 --> 01:25:44,835
and came out on the
right season..

524
01:25:47,179 --> 01:25:49,807
he must have this specialty

525
01:25:51,484 --> 01:25:54,715
as much he's human
is also animal.

526
01:25:56,856 --> 01:26:00,019
i think..
he's manimal.

527
01:26:03,195 --> 01:26:03,991
yes..

528
01:26:43,469 --> 01:26:44,766
are you alright yes why

529
01:26:45,304 --> 01:26:46,236
i'll be late

530
01:26:47,139 --> 01:26:51,007
the person who attacked
on us is gaining conscious

531
01:26:58,584 --> 01:27:04,045
till he regain conscious,
we could help him and he help us.

532
01:27:11,030 --> 01:27:12,497
why you've come here

533
01:27:12,731 --> 01:27:13,629
i was suffocating.

534
01:27:21,707 --> 01:27:23,402
i'm very scared, he'll kill me.

535
01:27:29,748 --> 01:27:30,549
nothing gonna happen

536
01:27:33,385 --> 01:27:34,443
kill him

537
01:28:01,747 --> 01:28:04,375
he attempted to kill me.

538
01:28:05,184 --> 01:28:06,208
did you see?

539
01:28:06,886 --> 01:28:08,615
if you'd not come to save
me on right time.

540
01:28:10,556 --> 01:28:11,921
what l did wrong to them

541
01:28:12,758 --> 01:28:15,386
why they're after me.

542
01:28:16,262 --> 01:28:18,196
its right to be worry but please.

543
01:28:19,899 --> 01:28:20,763
now relax.

544
01:28:22,234 --> 01:28:26,295
maybe we'd know it if
we could keep him alive more days.

545
01:28:28,274 --> 01:28:30,970
but who're they,
and why are attacking us.

546
01:28:34,780 --> 01:28:36,820
maybe for that the father made
the anti dot of virus

547
01:28:39,451 --> 01:28:40,543
yes l was thinking that too

548
01:28:40,986 --> 01:28:42,317
me too

549
01:28:43,822 --> 01:28:45,653
i can't say it surely

550
01:28:46,692 --> 01:28:48,421
but it can be linked.

551
01:28:49,461 --> 01:28:52,123
in virus and anti dot and attack

552
01:28:52,631 --> 01:28:53,461
can be.

553
01:28:56,168 --> 01:28:57,648
that's mean they can come back again?

554
01:28:58,704 --> 01:29:00,069
again can spread the virus

555
01:29:01,140 --> 01:29:04,371
we can save people, but how?

556
01:29:05,277 --> 01:29:06,335
the burnt the lab

557
01:29:11,083 --> 01:29:12,516
but we've anti dot

558
01:29:13,085 --> 01:29:14,643
and it will be created on need.

559
01:29:21,894 --> 01:29:22,952
how

560
01:29:27,433 --> 01:29:30,061
i think till you will not show
her making anti dot.

561
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:32,763
till she will not stop asking questions

562
01:29:35,407 --> 01:29:36,669
because she's not priya..

563
01:29:43,515 --> 01:29:48,009
this time whoever is before us,
is just on journalist.

564
01:29:51,156 --> 01:29:54,421
today our priya just like
a journalist..

565
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:56,985
because she hasn't gone for
office for many days.

566
01:29:57,930 --> 01:29:59,557
inner journalist is trying
to come out.

567
01:30:01,934 --> 01:30:05,028
since tomorrow you're
going to office and now for sleeping

568
01:30:05,537 --> 01:30:06,629
but father..
lets go

569
01:30:17,116 --> 01:30:20,745
if we could know how father
made the virus anti dot so can help him

570
01:30:22,087 --> 01:30:23,213
this is very important.

571
01:30:24,023 --> 01:30:25,547
you can't understand because

572
01:31:01,260 --> 01:31:02,500
this is your appointment later.

573
01:31:07,900 --> 01:31:11,495
its time to announce the name
of the winners.

574
01:32:04,523 --> 01:32:05,490
my child...

575
01:32:22,241 --> 01:32:23,173
from my side.

576
01:32:25,811 --> 01:32:26,743
what's this?

577
01:32:27,279 --> 01:32:31,010
krish symbol,
whoever helps anyone gets this.

578
01:32:32,851 --> 01:32:34,409
where can l find krish!

579
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:36,319
i don’t know this..

580
01:32:36,889 --> 01:32:41,656
we just know that krish
reaches to right time

581
01:32:42,261 --> 01:32:47,665
where it can't reach,
people like you reach on time.

582
01:32:49,301 --> 01:32:50,393
what l did like this

583
01:32:51,003 --> 01:32:51,833
did!

584
01:32:59,445 --> 01:33:00,173
this is for..

585
01:33:01,113 --> 01:33:02,747
who with a mother from
his child..

586
01:33:02,748 --> 01:33:05,273
and mother from her life,
didn't let separate..

587
01:33:14,827 --> 01:33:16,624
and you can't understand.

588
01:38:28,073 --> 01:38:32,339
am l talking to priya
or my kaya..

589
01:38:33,211 --> 01:38:34,735
i want little more time

590
01:38:36,715 --> 01:38:38,580
that is what l don’t have

591
01:38:40,886 --> 01:38:45,255
till tomorrow,
if you'll give me that information

592
01:38:48,360 --> 01:38:54,128
or l'll get it by my way

593
01:39:07,579 --> 01:39:08,841
are all parameters normal

594
01:39:13,885 --> 01:39:15,565
so what he's doing in
his mother's stomach?

595
01:39:17,489 --> 01:39:18,717
bring him out

596
01:39:20,325 --> 01:39:21,257
right now

597
01:39:21,693 --> 01:39:23,456
but why for?

598
01:39:24,529 --> 01:39:32,529
i want to inject my dna
in his and want see

599
01:39:34,039 --> 01:39:35,301
that what will generate.

600
01:39:37,542 --> 01:39:41,535
because until we've not
yet done this experiment.

601
01:39:42,848 --> 01:39:48,411
on any human or animal
before he begot..

602
01:39:51,323 --> 01:39:54,156
if this time he'd be
bring out, so he'll be abort.

603
01:39:54,659 --> 01:39:55,523
he'll die

604
01:39:56,428 --> 01:39:58,293
till this child would not be of 3 month

605
01:39:59,297 --> 01:40:03,199
neither we can bring it out,
nor can do any experiment

606
01:40:04,202 --> 01:40:06,261
till we can't perform its dna test.

607
01:40:08,573 --> 01:40:09,665
how much time?

608
01:40:10,141 --> 01:40:11,233
at least 1 week.

609
01:40:13,612 --> 01:40:15,136
in 7 days.

610
01:40:17,749 --> 01:40:21,241
your 9 month pain will be finish

611
01:40:23,688 --> 01:40:28,148
and maybe my many years waiting too

612
01:40:40,038 --> 01:40:41,096
where are you

613
01:40:42,707 --> 01:40:45,437
shocking truth are appearing Krishna!

614
01:40:46,711 --> 01:40:47,769
first we came to know..

615
01:40:48,446 --> 01:40:50,573
that anti dot kaal pharma made.

616
01:40:51,349 --> 01:40:53,681
and the mutant was in our custody

617
01:40:54,252 --> 01:40:56,049
both dna is same.

618
01:40:59,557 --> 01:41:03,721
and now, the most shocking truth is

619
01:41:05,563 --> 01:41:12,696
and the dna we made is almost same.

620
01:41:14,940 --> 01:41:16,931
i performed test many
times for confirm it.

621
01:41:17,809 --> 01:41:20,369
but the result was same every time

622
01:41:21,179 --> 01:41:24,307
but how come its possible
because that anti dot we...

623
01:41:31,723 --> 01:41:33,486
i think priya woke up

624
01:41:33,925 --> 01:41:36,723
she's fine now.

625
01:41:41,399 --> 01:41:44,232
i'm going to singapore tomorrow,
you take care of yourself and priya

626
01:41:46,471 --> 01:41:47,165
why?

627
01:41:51,576 --> 01:41:55,808
singapore and dr. arya's
wrong intentions.

628
01:41:56,948 --> 01:41:58,916
are the important part
of my past.

629
01:42:01,753 --> 01:42:05,086
and the new truth and questions.

630
01:42:07,058 --> 01:42:12,121
maybe i can get the answers
from my past.

631
01:42:28,079 --> 01:42:29,512

yes

632
01:42:30,048 --> 01:42:31,106

how can l call you from far away

635
01:42:43,695 --> 01:42:45,094

an important research

640
01:42:57,942 --> 01:42:59,603

652
01:46:07,932 --> 01:46:08,956
you aren't priya

653
01:46:11,336 --> 01:46:14,772
if you are..
so must know who's krishna.

654
01:46:16,341 --> 01:46:17,467
and who's krish

655
01:46:21,279 --> 01:46:22,211
who're you?

656
01:46:27,819 --> 01:46:29,286
where's my priya.?

657
01:46:30,021 --> 01:46:31,454
yours?

658
01:46:50,441 --> 01:46:52,602
these tears can betray krishna..

659
01:46:55,246 --> 01:46:56,144
not to krissh

660
01:47:01,653 --> 01:47:02,847
where is my priya

661
01:47:04,022 --> 01:47:05,990
wherever is she..
is alright

662
01:47:07,659 --> 01:47:11,686
your priya and your child.

663
01:47:29,414 --> 01:47:33,009
and this time l'm speaking truth
with krishna and krish..

664
01:47:39,157 --> 01:47:40,317
where's he?

665
01:47:41,459 --> 01:47:44,189
welcome in the kaal's world.

666
01:47:48,399 --> 01:47:56,399
and l'm sorry to bring you
here against your wish

667
01:48:03,848 --> 01:48:04,746
so what did you know.

668
01:48:05,950 --> 01:48:06,746
that..

669
01:48:07,885 --> 01:48:12,254
an human should never
try to become God..

670
01:48:14,592 --> 01:48:15,889
several years ago.

671
01:48:17,095 --> 01:48:19,825
dr. arya made me hostage
in singapore..

672
01:48:22,166 --> 01:48:26,967
and during that, dr. arya did
weird experiment on me.

673
01:48:32,543 --> 01:48:35,671
if my experiment would
be successful

674
01:48:37,715 --> 01:48:40,047
so l'll make a new rohit mehra.

675
01:48:41,919 --> 01:48:43,750
by his blood and dna.

676
01:48:46,190 --> 01:48:49,057
which will have brain like rohit.

677
01:48:50,461 --> 01:48:52,258
and powers too

678
01:48:54,432 --> 01:48:59,961
but he'll walk on my finger tips.

679
01:49:01,105 --> 01:49:04,632
dr. arya created an kid
by using my dna..

680
01:49:07,478 --> 01:49:08,843
but that kid was disable.

681
01:49:10,815 --> 01:49:14,410
dr. arya said to dr. mathur
to kill that child..

682
01:49:15,853 --> 01:49:17,616
but dr. mathur didn't do it ..

683
01:49:18,790 --> 01:49:21,384
he left that kid outside
an orphanage.

684
01:49:22,326 --> 01:49:23,623
after that...

685
01:49:26,931 --> 01:49:31,197
an rich person adopt that child

686
01:49:33,271 --> 01:49:34,829
raised him up..

687
01:49:35,873 --> 01:49:37,101
its means..

688
01:49:38,242 --> 01:49:40,267
to whom i used to think my father.

689
01:49:42,113 --> 01:49:43,512
he wasn't my father.

690
01:49:46,384 --> 01:49:51,515
because that disable child is me.

691
01:49:53,224 --> 01:49:55,886
and you're my father.

692
01:50:07,905 --> 01:50:09,702
now everything will be fine.

693
01:50:11,776 --> 01:50:16,543
i found you...
now i got the answers of my questions.

694
01:50:18,015 --> 01:50:21,678
and now i'll find out my cure.

695
01:50:23,488 --> 01:50:28,585
just i need your help

696
01:50:29,894 --> 01:50:31,259
how can l help you

697
01:50:34,499 --> 01:50:36,694
by giving me your bone marrow.

698
01:50:46,043 --> 01:50:47,476
i'll give you

699
01:50:48,579 --> 01:50:49,876
i'll help you

700
01:50:51,682 --> 01:50:54,879
but you've to stop all this
which you're doing

701
01:50:57,188 --> 01:50:58,951
the world you created.

702
01:50:59,991 --> 01:51:01,390
will have to finish this here.

703
01:51:05,096 --> 01:51:06,791
can i call you dad?

704
01:51:08,099 --> 01:51:09,259
off course i can call you dad.

705
01:51:10,034 --> 01:51:11,194
because you're my dad..

706
01:51:12,537 --> 01:51:13,765
so dad...

707
01:51:17,575 --> 01:51:21,978
if you'll keep the condition...
so you'll hurt a lot..

708
01:51:23,581 --> 01:51:24,741
because then l...

709
01:51:25,516 --> 01:51:32,115
bring out your bone marrow from
that child which is in priya's stomach

710
01:51:34,091 --> 01:51:36,116
your grand child.

711
01:51:44,702 --> 01:51:45,828
he before get born..

712
01:51:47,071 --> 01:51:48,971
no..
he's alive.

713
01:51:50,041 --> 01:51:53,067
because..
i got the priya..

714
01:51:55,246 --> 01:51:56,406
want to see?

715
01:52:07,291 --> 01:52:11,751
but priya was there..

716
01:52:12,330 --> 01:52:14,764
whoever is there is not priya..

717
01:52:16,334 --> 01:52:17,892
is my manimal khaya.

718
01:52:18,970 --> 01:52:23,134
in the face of priya,
real priya is here safe..

719
01:52:24,342 --> 01:52:26,572
and her child health

720
01:52:27,311 --> 01:52:29,176
and his bone marrow too

721
01:52:30,114 --> 01:52:32,344
do you think l'm alone this time..

722
01:52:34,218 --> 01:52:36,914
therefore you can do anything with us.

723
01:52:39,590 --> 01:52:45,222
but you don’t know how powerful are
the tears of a father...

724
01:52:47,398 --> 01:52:49,389
that's why you can't see.

725
01:52:50,835 --> 01:52:52,598
coming toward you

726
01:55:13,978 --> 01:55:14,945
are you alright?

727
01:55:25,089 --> 01:55:26,021
kaal is not here..

728
01:56:05,095 --> 01:56:06,460
come dad.

729
01:56:15,706 --> 01:56:17,571
now l'm stood on my legs..

730
01:56:20,578 --> 01:56:22,773
how're you feeling kaal

731
01:56:26,450 --> 01:56:29,317
i was talking to my dad..

732
01:56:54,845 --> 01:56:56,813
this is just beginning.

733
01:56:58,549 --> 01:57:02,349
now i've to shed a lot of blood

734
01:58:15,893 --> 01:58:19,852
feeling good coming in your world?

735
01:58:25,936 --> 01:58:31,135
look kaya....
now kaal is destruction for all

736
01:58:32,409 --> 01:58:35,901
i'll destroy the humans
and will make new generation

737
01:58:37,114 --> 01:58:38,581
now this world is mine.

738
01:58:41,151 --> 01:58:42,812
would be mine

739
01:58:44,455 --> 01:58:47,515
but you choosed the different path

740
01:58:50,027 --> 01:58:51,790
by breaking my trust.

741
01:58:59,803 --> 01:59:06,333
i knew that kaya would bring
krishh here..

742
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:12,014
and l wanted this too

743
01:59:59,863 --> 02:00:02,661
you're gonna need these tears

744
02:00:04,535 --> 02:00:06,162
keep them safe

745
02:00:13,911 --> 02:00:15,640
sorry... for our father

746
02:00:19,883 --> 02:00:21,077
yes..we're brothers

747
02:00:22,286 --> 02:00:24,948
two son of one father.

748
02:00:26,223 --> 02:00:30,387
the difference is just,
you're because of love.

749
02:03:08,185 --> 02:03:13,714
my victory will be by your
and your childs end.

750
02:03:23,033 --> 02:03:25,934
i won't live the sign
of this generation

751
02:06:17,607 --> 02:06:23,102
you people wanted something
and were habitual

752
02:06:23,880 --> 02:06:25,472
to whom kaal killed

753
02:06:26,850 --> 02:06:29,819
i've finished the krishh

754
02:06:40,430 --> 02:06:43,695
i've made the krishh immortal

755
02:06:45,001 --> 02:06:47,970
and the turn is of priya mehra.

756
02:06:57,981 --> 02:07:01,417
as much time will he take
to come to me

757
02:07:03,019 --> 02:07:08,082
as much pain i'll give you all

758
02:09:15,685 --> 02:09:19,280
please God.

759
02:10:07,170 --> 02:10:09,604
never consider yourself alone.

760
02:10:11,307 --> 02:10:15,107
because an spirit..

761
02:10:16,046 --> 02:10:17,035
energy

762
02:10:17,781 --> 02:10:19,806
is only in body

763
02:10:21,184 --> 02:10:23,652
the past life comes
back becoming new life.

764
02:10:25,822 --> 02:10:26,754
look

765
02:10:27,791 --> 02:10:29,156

i'm alive in you

767
02:10:32,962 --> 02:10:34,486
our powers are merging.

768
02:10:35,699 --> 02:10:37,030

you're like an insects for me.

774
02:11:55,411 --> 02:11:58,437
and inferior ray which i can
crush anytime.

775
02:12:00,016 --> 02:12:02,712
so how come will you save it.

776
02:12:03,353 --> 02:12:04,581
by giving our life.

777
02:12:05,121 --> 02:12:06,179

779
02:12:11,394 --> 02:12:13,988
you're a small..
and you act like that..

780
02:12:14,597 --> 02:12:17,589
i'm small so what..
should mush have courage.

781
02:12:18,434 --> 02:12:19,867
krish told me.

782
02:12:20,837 --> 02:12:22,828
krish was..
kaal is ..

783
02:12:24,140 --> 02:12:25,505
krish is an thought.

784
02:12:27,210 --> 02:12:28,905
which can't be killed
by any kaal

785
02:12:31,781 --> 02:12:34,045
till one will be stay alive
in all of us..

786
02:12:35,985 --> 02:12:37,009
the krish will remain

787
02:13:38,348 --> 02:13:39,838
what kaal...
are you scared

788
02:19:02,538 --> 02:19:03,596

02:19:21,123 --> 02:19:25,287
to father or to child?

794
02:19:31,467 --> 02:19:32,900
look at yourself..

795
02:19:34,070 --> 02:19:37,403
you're an just a ordinary human

796
02:19:38,874 --> 02:19:40,273
an ordinary son

797
02:19:41,644 --> 02:19:43,669
and weak father.

798
02:19:52,622 --> 02:19:56,080
being human is not my weakness,
but its my power..

799
02:19:57,693 --> 02:20:00,127
because l've blessing of my father.

so i can't die too

806
02:23:49,258 --> 02:23:56,130
how much badness has power,
the goodness ends it always.
