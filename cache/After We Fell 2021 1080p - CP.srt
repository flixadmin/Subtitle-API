1
00:01:10,325 --> 00:01:13,094
No. You gotta get out now!
I can't do this anymore.

2
00:01:13,128 --> 00:01:14,962
I will not let her see you
like this.

3
00:01:14,996 --> 00:01:17,564
- You need help!
- I didn't mean it. I'm sorry.

4
00:01:17,598 --> 00:01:19,833
- You're always sorry.
- Come on.

5
00:01:19,867 --> 00:01:21,735
How am I supposed to
believe you?

6
00:01:21,769 --> 00:01:23,771
- Every time!
- You've been trying...

7
00:01:23,804 --> 00:01:26,740
Do you know how many times
you've promised you would stop?

8
00:01:26,774 --> 00:01:28,609
- This is not my fault.
- Not your fault?

9
00:01:28,642 --> 00:01:30,577
You're drunk.
In the middle of the day.

10
00:01:30,611 --> 00:01:33,014
- Of course they fired you.
- Can we please talk about this?

11
00:01:33,048 --> 00:01:36,017
- You don't give a shit about us.
- Please.

12
00:01:36,051 --> 00:01:37,261
- You have to go.
- Don't do this.

13
00:01:37,285 --> 00:01:38,919
Get out and don't come back

14
00:01:38,952 --> 00:01:40,587
till you're sober.

15
00:01:40,621 --> 00:01:41,655
Daddy?

16
00:01:42,856 --> 00:01:44,025
Daddy!

17
00:01:47,262 --> 00:01:49,164
Daddy, don't go!

18
00:01:49,197 --> 00:01:51,232
No! No, no, no. Dad, please!

19
00:01:53,101 --> 00:01:54,868
No, don't go.

20
00:01:54,902 --> 00:01:58,339
- Please don't go, please!
- Tessa! Tessa!

21
00:01:58,373 --> 00:02:03,378
Please, daddy. Don't go.
Daddy, please don't go.

22
00:02:03,411 --> 00:02:06,613
Daddy! No!

23
00:02:18,093 --> 00:02:21,296
I can't tell you how good it is
to see you again, Tessie.

24
00:02:25,266 --> 00:02:29,070
There's towels in the bathroom,
if you want to take a shower.

25
00:02:29,104 --> 00:02:31,905
- I'll make us some food.
- Thanks.

26
00:02:43,251 --> 00:02:44,651
This is good.

27
00:02:46,254 --> 00:02:48,323
I remember you were
quite the cook, Tessie.

28
00:02:48,356 --> 00:02:51,292
- Thanks.
- Just like your mom.

29
00:02:54,395 --> 00:02:56,431
I tried to call you, you know.

30
00:02:56,464 --> 00:03:00,968
Sent you gifts
every birthday, Christmas.

31
00:03:01,002 --> 00:03:02,903
She didn't tell you, did she?

32
00:03:05,373 --> 00:03:06,707
No.

33
00:03:07,774 --> 00:03:09,077
Yeah.

34
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,945
So the prodigal father
has returned.

35
00:03:13,914 --> 00:03:16,050
What for? What do you want?

36
00:03:16,084 --> 00:03:19,254
You can stay, if...
If you want to.

37
00:03:19,287 --> 00:03:22,257
We have room, and I don't
want you out on the street.

38
00:03:27,362 --> 00:03:30,231
- Are you still drinking?
- Can you excuse us for a second?

39
00:03:33,201 --> 00:03:35,470
I know that this isn't
the most convenient,

40
00:03:35,503 --> 00:03:37,472
but you, of all people,
should appreciate me

41
00:03:37,505 --> 00:03:40,308
- giving him a second chance.
- Me, of all people, would know

42
00:03:40,341 --> 00:03:42,143
that he's probably
out there right now

43
00:03:42,177 --> 00:03:44,279
shoving all of our shit
into his pockets.

44
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,348
He's gonna hurt you.

45
00:03:47,382 --> 00:03:49,716
- You don't know him.
- Neither do you.

46
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,253
It's been, what, 10 years
since you last saw him?

47
00:03:54,888 --> 00:03:55,956
Nine.

48
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,927
Look, I'm just trying
to protect you.

49
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,130
I don't need you to protect me.

50
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:16,177
I know exactly why you're here,

51
00:04:16,211 --> 00:04:18,879
so you may as well just
take this and be on your way.

52
00:04:22,417 --> 00:04:24,152
I don't want your money, kid.

53
00:04:25,852 --> 00:04:28,389
All I want is a relationship
with my daughter.

54
00:04:30,992 --> 00:04:34,429
- If you hurt her...
- Hey, whoa, easy.

55
00:04:34,462 --> 00:04:37,031
I know you have no reason
in the world to trust me,

56
00:04:37,065 --> 00:04:39,200
but how about
you give me a shot, huh?

57
00:04:55,049 --> 00:04:57,951
Well, have you found
a place in Seattle yet?

58
00:04:57,986 --> 00:04:59,554
- Nope.
- No?

59
00:04:59,587 --> 00:05:02,923
- Nope.
- I'm gonna miss you, dude.

60
00:05:02,956 --> 00:05:04,568
Gonna have to start watching
<i>the Kardashians</i>

61
00:05:04,592 --> 00:05:06,960
to get my fill of drama
in your absence.

62
00:05:06,995 --> 00:05:10,098
Landon, I'm only going
to Seattle.

63
00:05:10,131 --> 00:05:12,833
You're just a facetime away.
You can always visit.

64
00:05:12,866 --> 00:05:15,503
Between work and school,
you are gonna be swamped.

65
00:05:15,536 --> 00:05:17,904
You're not gonna have
any time for anything,

66
00:05:17,938 --> 00:05:21,209
like friends, family and
especially not people like...

67
00:05:24,612 --> 00:05:27,781
People like who? Me?

68
00:05:30,884 --> 00:05:33,488
Is there something you wanna
tell me, or should I ask Landon?

69
00:05:33,521 --> 00:05:35,290
He seems to know
a lot more than I do.

70
00:05:35,323 --> 00:05:39,260
Not today, Satan. I am
gonna see you both this weekend,

71
00:05:39,294 --> 00:05:41,362
- at the lake house.
- Don't bet on it.

72
00:05:41,396 --> 00:05:42,963
- Okay.
- We'll be there.

73
00:05:48,303 --> 00:05:50,904
- What?
- What do you mean, what?

74
00:05:50,937 --> 00:05:52,939
When was this
supposed to happen?

75
00:05:52,974 --> 00:05:56,544
- A week?
- What? A week?

76
00:05:56,577 --> 00:05:59,280
You're going away in a week,
you haven't even told me?

77
00:05:59,314 --> 00:06:02,450
When was I supposed to tell you?
Because you left.

78
00:06:03,651 --> 00:06:05,520
Yeah, I'm here. I came back.

79
00:06:05,553 --> 00:06:07,422
And I came back for you.

80
00:06:07,455 --> 00:06:09,557
I couldn't get a hold
of you for nine days.

81
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,825
I didn't know
if I'd ever see you again.

82
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:16,564
So, what, is that it then?

83
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:20,867
I mean...

84
00:06:20,901 --> 00:06:25,440
Yeah, this... this job's a huge
opportunity for me. And...

85
00:06:25,473 --> 00:06:29,510
And I'm hoping, I was hoping,
that you would come with me.

86
00:06:33,147 --> 00:06:37,018
I was hoping that we could move
to London after graduation.

87
00:06:40,054 --> 00:06:42,156
And how was I supposed
to know that?

88
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,624
Well, I was gonna tell you.

89
00:06:43,658 --> 00:06:46,294
But it doesn't really matter
anymore, does it?

90
00:06:46,327 --> 00:06:48,429
You've made up your mind,
you've got a plan.

91
00:06:48,463 --> 00:06:50,374
Envisioned your life in a way
that doesn't have me in it.

92
00:06:50,398 --> 00:06:52,633
You are in it,
if you want to be.

93
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:57,938
Look, I get that you're angry.

94
00:06:57,972 --> 00:06:59,507
And we do
need to talk about this,

95
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,609
except I have
to get to class, so...

96
00:07:03,378 --> 00:07:06,981
We will continue
this discussion.

97
00:07:07,014 --> 00:07:08,516
Oh, that's really big of you.

98
00:07:08,549 --> 00:07:11,285
To find time in
your busy schedule. Thank you.

99
00:07:23,564 --> 00:07:24,898
Hey.

100
00:07:43,584 --> 00:07:45,253
Hi, mom, how's London?

101
00:07:45,286 --> 00:07:48,055
Good. I just wanted
to check you're okay.

102
00:07:48,089 --> 00:07:51,526
I heard that Tessa took the job
with Vance, in Seattle.

103
00:07:51,559 --> 00:07:52,994
Where did you hear that?

104
00:07:53,027 --> 00:07:55,096
Christian and I
were talking earlier.

105
00:07:55,129 --> 00:07:56,431
That's kind of weird.

106
00:07:56,464 --> 00:07:58,032
He and I have known each other

107
00:07:58,065 --> 00:07:59,534
since long before you were born.

108
00:07:59,567 --> 00:08:01,569
<i>I'd prefer not everyone
knows my business.</i>

109
00:08:01,602 --> 00:08:03,404
Mom, I'm gonna call you back.

110
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,226
Do you need a ride somewhere?

111
00:08:28,296 --> 00:08:30,665
Uh, yeah. Yeah, sure.

112
00:08:41,209 --> 00:08:43,044
- Thanks.
- Mm-hm.

113
00:08:45,813 --> 00:08:47,482
Hey, you wanna come inside?

114
00:08:51,152 --> 00:08:52,620
Fuck it, why not.

115
00:08:59,293 --> 00:09:00,428
Enjoy.

116
00:09:02,797 --> 00:09:04,465
What are we drinking about?

117
00:09:04,499 --> 00:09:07,201
I didn't know
we needed a reason.

118
00:09:07,235 --> 00:09:08,369
Cheers to that.

119
00:09:14,742 --> 00:09:18,112
Oh, look at her in this one.

120
00:09:18,145 --> 00:09:19,647
Mmm.

121
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:24,218
She looks really happy.

122
00:09:24,252 --> 00:09:28,389
I've really been trying.
Now more than ever.

123
00:09:28,422 --> 00:09:30,191
- Yeah.
- Well...

124
00:09:30,224 --> 00:09:33,694
Clearly not right now.
But I am trying.

125
00:09:33,728 --> 00:09:36,531
You know, you really remind me
of me when I was your age.

126
00:09:36,564 --> 00:09:39,066
- Fuck that.
- Mmm, yeah.

127
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,669
- Seriously?
- Hey. Hey, buddy.

128
00:09:41,702 --> 00:09:43,671
Private conversation,
if you don't mind.

129
00:09:43,704 --> 00:09:46,107
Hey, just trying
to get some ideas.

130
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,276
Whoa!

131
00:09:48,309 --> 00:09:50,611
That is my daughter,
you fucking piece of shit.

132
00:10:01,155 --> 00:10:02,256
Hey.

133
00:10:04,859 --> 00:10:06,561
I'm sorry, who is this?

134
00:10:07,895 --> 00:10:09,830
What are you doing here?

135
00:10:09,864 --> 00:10:12,567
Uh, bonding.

136
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,634
- Hey, Tess.
- Hardin...

137
00:10:15,603 --> 00:10:17,138
What the hell did you do?

138
00:10:17,171 --> 00:10:19,807
- I didn't do any...
- The bartender called me.

139
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,842
Oh, come on.
It wasn't a big deal.

140
00:10:21,876 --> 00:10:25,112
- Look, he's fine.
- You're drunk.

141
00:10:25,146 --> 00:10:27,214
I had a drink. I just...
Look, it was...

142
00:10:27,248 --> 00:10:28,725
- I was backing up your dad.
- Really?

143
00:10:28,749 --> 00:10:31,218
I didn't start...
He started it actually, so...

144
00:10:31,252 --> 00:10:32,587
Somebody called the cops.

145
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,422
You probably called the cops,
you snitch.

146
00:10:34,455 --> 00:10:36,324
Okay, let's go.

147
00:10:36,357 --> 00:10:38,326
Don't be mad at him.

148
00:10:38,359 --> 00:10:39,627
He loves you.

149
00:10:41,162 --> 00:10:42,363
That's all.

150
00:10:43,864 --> 00:10:45,700
Whoa!

151
00:10:45,733 --> 00:10:51,205
Yeah, you see that?
Solid guy right there.

152
00:10:51,238 --> 00:10:53,441
- Why would anyone leave you?
- I don't know.

153
00:10:53,474 --> 00:10:55,543
Yeah, this is just...
It's so enjoyable.

154
00:10:55,576 --> 00:10:57,845
Why wouldn't I stay?

155
00:10:57,878 --> 00:10:59,280
I think we're in trouble.

156
00:10:59,313 --> 00:11:01,449
Hey, hey, hey, easy.

157
00:11:33,614 --> 00:11:36,917
You know, I'm not sure
that I like this new friendship.

158
00:11:36,951 --> 00:11:39,387
I was just trying to be nice.

159
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:42,189
I offered him a ride, and
the bar was actually his idea.

160
00:11:42,223 --> 00:11:45,192
He's an alcoholic,
and so are you.

161
00:11:47,228 --> 00:11:49,530
Two alcoholics walk into a bar.

162
00:11:54,502 --> 00:11:56,637
I'm glad
you think this is funny.

163
00:11:56,671 --> 00:11:59,306
I was showing him some
pictures of you on my phone,

164
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,708
and this asshole leans over

165
00:12:00,741 --> 00:12:03,210
and starts saying
what he'd like to do to you.

166
00:12:05,981 --> 00:12:08,349
So... I mean, so?

167
00:12:08,382 --> 00:12:10,651
So I told him
I've already done that.

168
00:12:32,573 --> 00:12:34,542
- Hardin...
- What?

169
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:40,414
I'm apologizing.

170
00:13:05,306 --> 00:13:06,306
I'm sorry.

171
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,310
I'm so sorry.

172
00:13:14,348 --> 00:13:16,951
- Please forgive me.
- I, that's...

173
00:13:18,486 --> 00:13:21,756
- That's not fair.
- Please forgive me.

174
00:13:21,789 --> 00:13:24,892
- What if...?
- Shh, he's asleep.

175
00:13:56,724 --> 00:13:58,726
Tessa.

176
00:14:00,028 --> 00:14:01,495
Oh, Tessa.

177
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,342
Oh, fuck...

178
00:14:32,693 --> 00:14:36,564
So, uh, I heard
you guys are moving.

179
00:14:36,597 --> 00:14:39,567
Yeah, yeah. I actually need
to start packing.

180
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,936
I'll just finish up
and get out of here.

181
00:14:41,969 --> 00:14:43,804
No, no, no.
No, I didn't mean it like...

182
00:14:43,838 --> 00:14:46,007
Nah, nah.
You don't need me around here.

183
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,676
I'll just... I got
a few errands to run anyway.

184
00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:50,078
Dad...

185
00:14:54,149 --> 00:14:56,017
That feels really weird to say.

186
00:14:59,854 --> 00:15:01,089
Well, that'll be my ride.

187
00:15:03,724 --> 00:15:05,026
You're leaving now?

188
00:15:06,161 --> 00:15:08,163
Yeah.

189
00:15:08,196 --> 00:15:09,396
Come here.

190
00:15:12,033 --> 00:15:14,368
Thank you so much
for letting me stay.

191
00:15:17,005 --> 00:15:18,939
No, stay, stay. He's coming.

192
00:15:21,076 --> 00:15:22,810
Uh, hey, don't...

193
00:15:26,014 --> 00:15:28,549
Don't disappear on me again.

194
00:15:36,557 --> 00:15:37,658
Hardin.

195
00:15:44,932 --> 00:15:46,901
So you shipping me out next?

196
00:15:52,773 --> 00:15:54,808
- You okay?
- You know, it's not like

197
00:15:54,842 --> 00:15:56,144
I want to leave you.

198
00:15:58,046 --> 00:15:59,046
You don't have to.

199
00:16:01,249 --> 00:16:04,685
Vance's offer, it's literally...
It's a dream come true.

200
00:16:04,718 --> 00:16:07,022
I've wanted to live in Seattle
since I was a kid.

201
00:16:07,055 --> 00:16:08,990
The only thing
that would make it better

202
00:16:09,024 --> 00:16:10,858
is if you came with me.

203
00:16:10,891 --> 00:16:13,827
I don't... I don't know
why you want me there.

204
00:16:15,629 --> 00:16:17,898
I don't really fit
into that flashy lifestyle.

205
00:16:17,932 --> 00:16:20,068
It's never been the kind of
thing you've been after...

206
00:16:20,101 --> 00:16:22,170
- I want to make a life together.
- So do I.

207
00:16:22,203 --> 00:16:23,737
So stay here, and we can.

208
00:16:23,771 --> 00:16:25,539
- You're not listening.
- I am listening.

209
00:16:25,572 --> 00:16:27,608
- I've wanted this job since I...
- I know.

210
00:16:27,641 --> 00:16:30,145
You have a great job in Seattle.
That is great.

211
00:16:30,178 --> 00:16:32,981
I'm happy for you. But I don't.
I don't have anything there.

212
00:16:33,014 --> 00:16:35,582
- You'd have me.
- Okay, that's not enough.

213
00:16:40,654 --> 00:16:42,556
You know I didn't mean that.

214
00:16:46,927 --> 00:16:48,829
Well, if I'm...

215
00:16:48,862 --> 00:16:52,499
If I'm not enough, that's...
That's your problem.

216
00:16:52,533 --> 00:16:54,102
But you're not gonna stop me.

217
00:17:40,681 --> 00:17:42,549
Vance publishing, please hold.

218
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,219
No, I can't. I'm swamped.

219
00:17:44,252 --> 00:17:46,087
You're gonna have to speak
to my assistant.

220
00:17:46,121 --> 00:17:47,955
No, the new one.

221
00:17:49,257 --> 00:17:51,259
Um, well, I'll try
and squeeze you in

222
00:17:51,292 --> 00:17:53,228
for 30 minutes this afternoon.

223
00:17:53,261 --> 00:17:55,030
Tessa! Hey, come in.

224
00:17:55,063 --> 00:17:57,332
- I can come back.
- No, no. Come in. I'm just...

225
00:17:57,365 --> 00:17:59,100
- I'm heading out.
- Yeah.

226
00:17:59,134 --> 00:18:03,204
- Um, you have a safe trip.
- Okay. See you.

227
00:18:04,973 --> 00:18:07,875
Are you sure that you're okay
driving up by yourself?

228
00:18:07,908 --> 00:18:10,311
- She's not going by herself.
- I'm taking Smith with me.

229
00:18:13,614 --> 00:18:15,716
Besides, I prefer to get us
settled up there

230
00:18:15,749 --> 00:18:18,685
while Christian
finishes things here.

231
00:18:18,719 --> 00:18:21,056
Have you decided what part
of town you'll be staying in?

232
00:18:21,089 --> 00:18:23,657
No, I'm still deciding
between two places.

233
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:26,094
It's scary trying to pick
somewhere off the Internet.

234
00:18:26,127 --> 00:18:27,928
No, Tessa. Just stay with us.

235
00:18:27,961 --> 00:18:29,297
You know,
until you get situated.

236
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:30,898
No, no. I couldn't ask...

237
00:18:30,931 --> 00:18:34,269
You didn't.
Come on, it'll be fun.

238
00:18:34,302 --> 00:18:35,803
Christian will be thrilled.

239
00:18:35,836 --> 00:18:38,239
He's been dying
to spend time with hardin.

240
00:18:38,273 --> 00:18:41,976
Uh, well, he's actually
not coming with me.

241
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:44,212
Oh.

242
00:18:44,245 --> 00:18:46,580
Well, when he comes
to visit, then.

243
00:18:50,051 --> 00:18:53,388
You know, between us,

244
00:18:53,421 --> 00:18:56,224
Christian was disappointed
hardin turned him down

245
00:18:56,257 --> 00:18:58,126
on his job offer.

246
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:01,795
What... what job was that?

247
00:19:03,131 --> 00:19:05,666
Basically, anything he wanted.

248
00:19:20,814 --> 00:19:22,117
Hey.

249
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:24,252
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't walk away from me.

250
00:19:24,285 --> 00:19:26,753
- Hey, don't follow me.
- Tess, I'm sorry.

251
00:19:26,787 --> 00:19:28,889
I didn't mean it.
I shouldn't have said it.

252
00:19:28,922 --> 00:19:30,958
Can you stop saying things
you don't mean?

253
00:19:30,992 --> 00:19:32,427
I can't tell what's true.

254
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,162
Can you stop making decisions

255
00:19:34,195 --> 00:19:36,097
without talking things
through first?

256
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:39,267
Okay.

257
00:19:41,169 --> 00:19:42,870
Okay.

258
00:19:42,903 --> 00:19:45,906
Kimberly invited me to stay
with them in Seattle,

259
00:19:45,939 --> 00:19:48,076
- if that's not weird?
- Did she?

260
00:19:48,109 --> 00:19:50,078
No, no, no. It's not weird.

261
00:19:50,111 --> 00:19:52,180
It's good. It's great.

262
00:19:52,213 --> 00:19:55,250
Vance is always gone,
so I think it'll be a win-win.

263
00:19:55,283 --> 00:19:56,650
Yeah.

264
00:19:58,819 --> 00:20:01,688
How do you think they make
that work, the long-distance?

265
00:20:01,722 --> 00:20:03,657
I don't know, they communicate?

266
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,163
Heh, wait, wait, wait.
What was that?

267
00:20:08,196 --> 00:20:10,898
- What?
- The thing underneath the thing

268
00:20:10,931 --> 00:20:13,468
that you just said.

269
00:20:13,501 --> 00:20:15,036
Why didn't you tell me

270
00:20:15,069 --> 00:20:17,871
that Vance offered you
a job in Seattle?

271
00:20:17,905 --> 00:20:19,440
Because I wasn't gonna take it.

272
00:20:19,474 --> 00:20:22,343
But why didn't you tell me
that you weren't gonna take it?

273
00:20:22,377 --> 00:20:24,379
Here I am,
begging you to come with me,

274
00:20:24,412 --> 00:20:27,148
- just to find out that...
- He kept on harping on me.

275
00:20:27,182 --> 00:20:29,217
It wasn't something
I wanted to deal with.

276
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:32,120
Remember, at the time,
I had no idea you were going.

277
00:20:33,521 --> 00:20:35,290
We do need to stop

278
00:20:35,323 --> 00:20:37,225
keeping secrets from each other.

279
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,029
Agreed.

280
00:21:00,048 --> 00:21:01,983
We'll have fun
this weekend, okay?

281
00:21:03,051 --> 00:21:04,185
Okay.

282
00:21:22,337 --> 00:21:23,371
You look like popeye.

283
00:21:25,974 --> 00:21:29,444
- A very sexy popeye, come on.
- Get up, we're gonna be late.

284
00:21:34,449 --> 00:21:36,551
We could've just met you there,
couldn't we?

285
00:21:36,584 --> 00:21:38,253
Why did we have to
all come together?

286
00:21:38,286 --> 00:21:40,821
- We could've made our own way.
- It's a long drive.

287
00:21:40,854 --> 00:21:42,190
And this way, we get to have

288
00:21:42,223 --> 00:21:44,791
some very much needed
family time.

289
00:21:44,825 --> 00:21:45,792
Yeah.

290
00:21:45,826 --> 00:21:47,161
Much needed, great.

291
00:21:48,263 --> 00:21:50,064
You're lucky I love you.

292
00:21:51,332 --> 00:21:55,136
Okay, I spy with my little eye

293
00:21:55,169 --> 00:21:56,371
something black.

294
00:21:56,404 --> 00:21:59,540
Black. Easy, hardin's soul.

295
00:21:59,574 --> 00:22:01,209
- Oh, yeah, ha-ha!
- Hey!

296
00:22:01,242 --> 00:22:02,443
- Come on, boys!
- That's why.

297
00:22:02,477 --> 00:22:04,312
- Boys...
- That's why your soul is black.

298
00:22:04,345 --> 00:22:06,180
Hey, don't touch this!

299
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:30,371
Shut up!

300
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:51,292
Are you still going to New York?

301
00:22:51,326 --> 00:22:56,064
Yeah, I've got everything set up
at nyu, so I'm just gonna...

302
00:22:56,097 --> 00:22:58,533
I guess, go with the flow,
you know?

303
00:22:58,566 --> 00:23:02,303
Mmm. I need
to get better at that.

304
00:23:02,337 --> 00:23:05,973
Are you having...
You having second thoughts?

305
00:23:06,007 --> 00:23:09,043
And third and fourth
and fifth and...

306
00:23:09,077 --> 00:23:12,180
I don't know. I'm just worried
that I made the wrong decision.

307
00:23:12,213 --> 00:23:15,916
- Tess...
- It's just, apparently...

308
00:23:15,949 --> 00:23:20,388
Hardin wanted me to go england
with him after graduation.

309
00:23:20,421 --> 00:23:23,224
And I don't know.
Maybe I should.

310
00:23:23,257 --> 00:23:25,959
You've been
gushing about Seattle

311
00:23:25,993 --> 00:23:27,628
since the day I first met you.

312
00:23:27,662 --> 00:23:29,197
Why stray from your path?

313
00:23:30,498 --> 00:23:33,401
- Go with the flow?
- No, no.

314
00:23:33,434 --> 00:23:36,204
Cop-out. That's not you.
That's me.

315
00:23:36,237 --> 00:23:38,039
You have to do you.

316
00:23:38,072 --> 00:23:40,274
Yeah, and what about him?

317
00:23:40,308 --> 00:23:43,478
What about him?
Mr. Grumpy? He's...

318
00:23:43,511 --> 00:23:47,348
If he loves you, he could...

319
00:23:47,382 --> 00:23:49,083
Follow you. I'm just saying.

320
00:23:50,118 --> 00:23:52,320
Ooh! Wow.

321
00:23:52,353 --> 00:23:54,989
Mm, some hard truth.
It's tough love.

322
00:23:55,022 --> 00:23:58,126
- I'm gonna need more wine.
- Good luck.

323
00:24:01,696 --> 00:24:04,098
See? Did you see...?

324
00:24:31,626 --> 00:24:33,428
I don't want to lose this.

325
00:24:36,597 --> 00:24:38,132
I don't either.

326
00:24:41,736 --> 00:24:44,405
But, "if adventures
will not befall"

327
00:24:44,439 --> 00:24:47,508
a young lady in her own village,
she must seek them abroad."

328
00:24:49,076 --> 00:24:50,745
But, "there is nothing
like staying"

329
00:24:50,778 --> 00:24:52,280
at home for real comfort."

330
00:24:53,614 --> 00:24:55,183
"You Pierce my soul.

331
00:24:55,216 --> 00:24:57,452
I'm half agony, half hope."

332
00:24:57,485 --> 00:24:59,454
"We are all fools in love."

333
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,091
I thought you were Darcy.

334
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:06,427
And you've just been
Jane Austen the whole time.

335
00:25:14,802 --> 00:25:17,371
So are you gonna show me
what you're writing there?

336
00:25:17,405 --> 00:25:20,107
I... maybe.

337
00:25:20,141 --> 00:25:21,141
Someday.

338
00:25:24,312 --> 00:25:25,646
Someday.

339
00:25:32,153 --> 00:25:36,591
- Reservation for Scott.
- Yes, Mr. Scott. Right this way.

340
00:25:44,632 --> 00:25:47,702
- Thank you.
- Hardin?

341
00:25:47,735 --> 00:25:51,739
- Ha! Hey, Lilly. How are you?
- Mm!

342
00:25:51,772 --> 00:25:54,075
- How are you?
- No fucking way.

343
00:25:54,108 --> 00:25:56,143
- Long time, huh?
- It's been forever.

344
00:25:56,177 --> 00:25:59,213
- This is Tessa. Tessa, Lillian.
- Hi.

345
00:25:59,247 --> 00:26:00,748
Nice dress.

346
00:26:04,485 --> 00:26:06,187
I'll be over in a second.

347
00:26:12,093 --> 00:26:13,694
I might get something
different, but...

348
00:26:13,728 --> 00:26:15,329
Really?

349
00:26:15,363 --> 00:26:17,164
Crab cakes.

350
00:26:17,198 --> 00:26:19,734
- Good evening, folks.
- Yes. Good evening.

351
00:26:19,767 --> 00:26:21,802
I'm Robert. I'll be
taking care of you tonight.

352
00:26:21,836 --> 00:26:24,171
Can I get you started
with a round of drinks?

353
00:26:24,205 --> 00:26:27,174
Yeah. I think we'll do
a bottle of cab for the table.

354
00:26:27,208 --> 00:26:30,077
- And some water for us.
- I think we're ready to order.

355
00:26:30,111 --> 00:26:33,080
- Great, what'll it be?
- You're gonna get the...

356
00:26:33,114 --> 00:26:35,750
- Crab cakes.
- Yes. And I'm gonna get the...

357
00:26:35,783 --> 00:26:37,485
- Fish and chips.
- Fish and chips.

358
00:26:37,518 --> 00:26:39,820
And also, we would
like to get a sablefish

359
00:26:39,854 --> 00:26:41,656
for after the meal to take home.

360
00:26:41,689 --> 00:26:43,257
That's a good choice.

361
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:47,128
- And for you?
- Um, is there anything

362
00:26:47,161 --> 00:26:48,829
that you'd recommend?

363
00:26:48,863 --> 00:26:52,333
The cedar-planked salmon
is our specialty.

364
00:26:52,366 --> 00:26:56,170
Okay. I'm more into like pasta?

365
00:26:56,203 --> 00:26:58,439
Carbs, yeah. I love carbs.

366
00:26:58,472 --> 00:27:01,676
Um, we have
a squid-ink spaghetti.

367
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:04,412
Um, it was lovely to see you

368
00:27:04,445 --> 00:27:07,415
and to meet you guys,
but I'll have to go. Sorry.

369
00:27:07,448 --> 00:27:10,451
Too fancy. How about we
whip you up something special?

370
00:27:13,287 --> 00:27:15,089
Yeah, okay. Thank you.

371
00:27:16,557 --> 00:27:18,659
Can I get you anything,
or do you need a minute?

372
00:27:18,693 --> 00:27:21,228
Yeah, you can come back.

373
00:27:21,262 --> 00:27:22,496
Robert.

374
00:27:24,565 --> 00:27:26,200
- Thanks, man.
- Thank you, Robert.

375
00:27:26,233 --> 00:27:27,501
Thank you.

376
00:27:33,641 --> 00:27:35,142
Alone at last.

377
00:27:37,311 --> 00:27:38,879
Ooh!

378
00:27:38,913 --> 00:27:40,481
That's good.

379
00:27:44,952 --> 00:27:48,556
Come on, before they get home.

380
00:27:52,827 --> 00:27:54,161
Ow, ow!

381
00:27:59,834 --> 00:28:02,737
I really hope they're having
more than one cocktail.

382
00:28:04,305 --> 00:28:06,907
You do kind of like it, though.

383
00:28:06,941 --> 00:28:08,743
The thrill of being caught.

384
00:28:16,684 --> 00:28:18,419
Oh, that's nice.

385
00:28:53,821 --> 00:28:54,922
Trust me.

386
00:31:10,992 --> 00:31:13,761
I really wish you
were coming to Seattle.

387
00:31:16,964 --> 00:31:20,801
- Can I ask you a question?
- Mmm.

388
00:31:20,835 --> 00:31:23,737
Does your moving to Seattle
have anything to do with Trevor?

389
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:33,647
No. No. I mean...
We barely even talk anymore.

390
00:31:39,486 --> 00:31:41,355
Did you ever
have feelings for him?

391
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,892
- That's two questions.
- Tess, be honest.

392
00:31:54,102 --> 00:31:56,837
Uh, there was a moment when...

393
00:31:58,539 --> 00:32:02,043
Hey! Seriously? That's not fair!

394
00:32:03,577 --> 00:32:04,879
Hardin!

395
00:32:13,021 --> 00:32:14,955
<i>Leave a message.</i>

396
00:32:17,025 --> 00:32:19,827
Hey, where are you?
Can you give me a call back?

397
00:32:56,964 --> 00:33:00,601
- Robert.
- Right. Um, Tessa.

398
00:33:00,634 --> 00:33:02,170
So, what are you doing out here?

399
00:33:03,837 --> 00:33:08,076
I had a fight with my...

400
00:33:08,109 --> 00:33:10,245
It's complicated.

401
00:33:10,278 --> 00:33:13,781
Well, a few of us are doing
after hours, if you wanna join.

402
00:33:13,814 --> 00:33:15,984
- Um, yeah.
- Yeah?

403
00:33:16,017 --> 00:33:17,484
- Yeah.
- Okay.

404
00:33:18,953 --> 00:33:21,222
Heh, you probably
should've worn a coat.

405
00:33:25,693 --> 00:33:28,896
- So you live here, right?
- Born and raised.

406
00:33:28,929 --> 00:33:31,532
But I actually just got
into med school.

407
00:33:31,565 --> 00:33:34,035
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah, so just working here,

408
00:33:34,069 --> 00:33:35,103
saving up till then.

409
00:33:35,136 --> 00:33:36,971
- Wow, congratulations.
- Thanks.

410
00:33:37,005 --> 00:33:38,639
Where are you going?

411
00:33:38,672 --> 00:33:40,075
Uw was my dream,

412
00:33:40,108 --> 00:33:42,177
but mount sinai gave me
a scholarship

413
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:45,546
- I couldn't pass up, so...
- Mount sinai is in...?

414
00:33:45,579 --> 00:33:47,115
- NYC.
- Okay.

415
00:33:47,148 --> 00:33:49,117
New York City.
You've heard of it.

416
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:50,851
The big apple, you know?

417
00:33:50,884 --> 00:33:53,821
And Nora, actually, Nora and I
went to undergrad together

418
00:33:53,854 --> 00:33:56,957
and then she moved out there,
so I'll know someone.

419
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,859
Talking shit? Yeah?

420
00:33:58,892 --> 00:34:00,861
She's already got
the New York attitude.

421
00:34:00,894 --> 00:34:03,630
- Tess. Hey.
- Hey! Hey.

422
00:34:03,664 --> 00:34:05,899
Okay, so this is Robert,
and this is Nora.

423
00:34:05,933 --> 00:34:08,969
Yes, there will be a test
afterwards.

424
00:34:09,004 --> 00:34:11,072
And they both live in New York.

425
00:34:11,106 --> 00:34:13,008
Thank you.

426
00:34:13,041 --> 00:34:15,043
In New York? Pleasure.

427
00:34:15,076 --> 00:34:17,578
Hey! What? Oh, my god!

428
00:34:18,779 --> 00:34:21,116
How are you? It's been...

429
00:34:21,149 --> 00:34:23,851
- You remember Robert, right?
- Yeah.

430
00:34:23,884 --> 00:34:26,687
I remember Robert. I'll do
an old fashioned, actually.

431
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,289
Oh. I'm off, actually.

432
00:34:28,323 --> 00:34:31,059
You're still wearing your
name tag and your uniform, so...

433
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:36,131
So I heard
that you're moving to Seattle.

434
00:34:36,164 --> 00:34:38,899
Yeah, um, I'm actually
transferring for work.

435
00:34:38,932 --> 00:34:40,968
Ah, I'm jealous.

436
00:34:41,002 --> 00:34:42,870
I'd much rather be
in Seattle than New York.

437
00:34:42,903 --> 00:34:44,905
I keep telling hardin
he should give it a shot.

438
00:34:44,938 --> 00:34:47,841
- It's not for me.
- No, it's not for him.

439
00:34:47,875 --> 00:34:48,986
- It's the best.
- It's the best.

440
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:50,644
It is, yeah.
My girlfriend and I,

441
00:34:50,677 --> 00:34:53,048
we've lived in capitol hill
for a few years now.

442
00:34:53,081 --> 00:34:56,617
- Oh, your girlfriend?
- Yeah, my girlfriend, Riley.

443
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:58,952
We should probably leave now.

444
00:34:58,987 --> 00:35:01,922
I don't really
wanna go just yet.

445
00:35:04,658 --> 00:35:06,194
I'm gonna head home.

446
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:12,800
Let me walk you out.

447
00:35:19,207 --> 00:35:22,709
- I'm really sorry about all of...
- You don't have to apologize.

448
00:35:22,743 --> 00:35:24,079
Sorry.

449
00:35:24,112 --> 00:35:26,347
Sorry. Heh!

450
00:35:26,381 --> 00:35:28,216
I don't know why I do that.

451
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,952
I could guess, but I won't.

452
00:35:37,025 --> 00:35:39,260
Um, it was nice meeting you.

453
00:35:39,294 --> 00:35:41,862
You too.

454
00:35:41,895 --> 00:35:43,264
And thanks for...

455
00:35:45,133 --> 00:35:46,134
Mm-hm.

456
00:35:49,237 --> 00:35:51,239
I'm not expecting anything,

457
00:35:51,272 --> 00:35:55,310
but if someday you find
yourself in the city...

458
00:35:58,146 --> 00:36:01,349
Give me a call. Or don't.

459
00:36:01,382 --> 00:36:02,984
It's up to you.

460
00:36:24,305 --> 00:36:26,107
Hey.

461
00:36:26,141 --> 00:36:28,176
Hey.

462
00:36:28,209 --> 00:36:29,310
Morning.

463
00:36:36,985 --> 00:36:39,887
- What's that face?
- How was... how was last night?

464
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,956
Oh, it was good. It was...
It was fine.

465
00:36:42,991 --> 00:36:44,325
Nora's nice. She's, uh...

466
00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:47,095
She's kind of a big deal
on the restaurant scene,

467
00:36:47,128 --> 00:36:49,796
so she's gonna show me around
when I get to New York.

468
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:52,699
- That's really convenient.
- It's all about... heh-heh.

469
00:36:54,835 --> 00:36:58,072
How was... How was the hot tub?

470
00:37:26,234 --> 00:37:27,734
Guess what Landon found.

471
00:37:40,548 --> 00:37:43,951
I thought that we were gonna be
more open with each other.

472
00:37:50,091 --> 00:37:51,993
So did I.

473
00:37:52,026 --> 00:37:54,895
I didn't ask for his number.
He just gave it to me. It...

474
00:37:54,928 --> 00:37:57,831
No. I just found another
guy's number in your things.

475
00:37:59,367 --> 00:38:02,936
You made it look like you were
with Lillian last night.

476
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:04,973
- Lillian's my friend.
- So is he.

477
00:38:05,006 --> 00:38:07,041
You guys just met.
How could you be friends?

478
00:38:07,075 --> 00:38:10,311
You do this. You sabotage
every good moment that we have.

479
00:38:10,345 --> 00:38:12,946
No. If I wanted to try
and sabotage a good moment,

480
00:38:12,981 --> 00:38:14,983
I would have brought
up your moment with Trevor,

481
00:38:15,016 --> 00:38:17,352
- but I'll do one at a time.
- Why can't you let things be?

482
00:38:17,385 --> 00:38:19,886
- Like, let us be happy for once.
- Tess, you must admit,

483
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,523
if I were moving away
with an admitted love interest,

484
00:38:22,557 --> 00:38:25,093
- you'd have feelings about that.
- Love interest?

485
00:38:25,126 --> 00:38:27,061
We're friends. From work.

486
00:38:27,095 --> 00:38:28,997
You don't get to choose
who I have as friends.

487
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:31,232
They don't wanna
be your fucking friends!

488
00:38:31,266 --> 00:38:33,167
Then why can't you
just trust me?

489
00:38:33,201 --> 00:38:35,336
I do trust you.
It's them I don't trust.

490
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:36,903
No, you don't.

491
00:38:36,937 --> 00:38:39,007
You don't trust me.
You don't trust anyone.

492
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,208
You just control them.

493
00:38:45,446 --> 00:38:49,183
Is this really about them,
or is this about me moving?

494
00:38:49,217 --> 00:38:52,186
The irony is, I got you
the damn job in the first place.

495
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:55,922
I mean, I might have had
something to do with it.

496
00:38:55,956 --> 00:38:57,924
Tess, how many freshmen
do you know

497
00:38:57,958 --> 00:38:59,527
with jobs
at top publishing firms,

498
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,829
their transfer's taken care of,
places to live, how many?

499
00:39:04,032 --> 00:39:05,932
Wow.

500
00:39:05,966 --> 00:39:08,303
This honesty thing's
really paying off for us.

501
00:39:08,336 --> 00:39:09,970
So I won't...

502
00:39:10,004 --> 00:39:13,274
I won't give up Seattle for
you, so you just turn on me?

503
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:18,313
There is a big difference
between not being able

504
00:39:18,346 --> 00:39:20,315
to live without someone
and loving them.

505
00:39:36,631 --> 00:39:39,567
He is scared of losing you.
He loves you.

506
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:43,237
He knows you're the best thing
that's ever happened to him.

507
00:39:43,271 --> 00:39:46,474
- Well...
- No, Tessa, it's true.

508
00:39:46,507 --> 00:39:49,977
You've changed his life.
He knows it.

509
00:39:50,011 --> 00:39:51,245
We all know it.

510
00:39:52,447 --> 00:39:55,350
You stay in touch. Okay.

511
00:39:55,383 --> 00:39:56,883
Bye.

512
00:40:57,712 --> 00:41:00,081
She's gonna thrive
up there, man.

513
00:41:00,114 --> 00:41:01,682
What, and that's a bad thing?

514
00:41:03,718 --> 00:41:07,255
This is a big step for her.
You should be happy for her.

515
00:41:07,288 --> 00:41:08,523
I am.

516
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:12,959
I am happy.

517
00:41:20,334 --> 00:41:23,204
You could come with her.
I've got loads of work for you...

518
00:41:23,237 --> 00:41:25,506
- I don't wanna do that.
- You'd get great benefits.

519
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,608
I don't want your handouts.

520
00:41:27,642 --> 00:41:29,444
I'm sorry, I...

521
00:41:29,477 --> 00:41:32,346
They're the reason I'm here,
and I don't want any more help.

522
00:41:33,648 --> 00:41:36,150
Tessa didn't get a favor.

523
00:41:36,184 --> 00:41:37,985
She's excellent.

524
00:41:38,019 --> 00:41:39,454
She earned this position.

525
00:41:42,256 --> 00:41:43,691
She does deserve it.

526
00:41:46,494 --> 00:41:48,629
I'm sure she'll do smashingly.

527
00:42:04,645 --> 00:42:06,113
Tessa?

528
00:42:10,451 --> 00:42:11,652
Tess?

529
00:42:15,356 --> 00:42:17,425
Tess?

530
00:43:29,397 --> 00:43:30,464
<i>Pain.</i>

531
00:43:30,498 --> 00:43:31,632
<i>Lately, I've become</i>

532
00:43:31,666 --> 00:43:33,734
<i>very well acquainted with it.</i>

533
00:43:33,768 --> 00:43:37,171
<i>The slow and steady aching pain,</i>

534
00:43:37,204 --> 00:43:39,674
<i>the type that comes when
you've been hurt repeatedly</i>

535
00:43:39,707 --> 00:43:41,442
<i>by the same person.</i>

536
00:43:48,215 --> 00:43:50,451
<i>You finally breathe,</i>

537
00:43:50,484 --> 00:43:53,220
<i>thinking that yesterday's
problem will stay in the past</i>

538
00:43:53,254 --> 00:43:56,324
<i>when, in fact,
it's today's problem,</i>

539
00:43:56,357 --> 00:43:57,658
<i>tomorrow's problem,</i>

540
00:43:57,692 --> 00:44:00,194
<i>and the problem
of every day after that.</i>

541
00:44:04,632 --> 00:44:08,235
<i>Only in those rare moments
when he pulls me to his chest</i>

542
00:44:08,269 --> 00:44:10,871
<i>and makes promises
he never seems able to keep</i>

543
00:44:10,905 --> 00:44:12,807
<i>does the pain disappear.</i>

544
00:44:22,516 --> 00:44:24,352
Shit. She looks upset.

545
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:27,688
- Hey!
- Hey!

546
00:44:29,357 --> 00:44:30,891
Let me take that
for you upstairs.

547
00:44:30,925 --> 00:44:32,326
Oh, thanks.

548
00:44:34,629 --> 00:44:36,897
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.

549
00:44:38,866 --> 00:44:41,202
Well, you look...

550
00:44:43,638 --> 00:44:44,872
terrible.

551
00:44:46,607 --> 00:44:47,742
Come here.

552
00:45:25,379 --> 00:45:26,647
Oh, uh, excuse me.

553
00:45:26,681 --> 00:45:28,849
Do you guys know
where Bagley hall is?

554
00:46:54,435 --> 00:46:56,604
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey.

555
00:46:56,637 --> 00:46:58,439
<i>Hey. What's going on?</i>

556
00:46:58,472 --> 00:47:00,008
<i>Hardin, come back here!</i>

557
00:47:17,092 --> 00:47:19,527
Tess, wait. Don't hang up.
That was iskra, my trainer.

558
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,595
- I'm at the gym.
- I'm kicking his ass, Tess!

559
00:47:21,629 --> 00:47:23,731
And he is not kicking my ass.

560
00:47:23,764 --> 00:47:26,067
I didn't mean to hang up.

561
00:47:26,101 --> 00:47:28,069
I think you did,
and I know exactly why,

562
00:47:28,103 --> 00:47:31,739
'cause I would have
thought the same thing.

563
00:47:31,772 --> 00:47:34,608
Yeah, I'm a little relieved.

564
00:47:34,642 --> 00:47:36,777
It's nice,
showing Landon the ropes.

565
00:47:38,379 --> 00:47:39,780
<i>Don't take all day.</i>

566
00:47:39,814 --> 00:47:40,814
<i>Okay, one minute.</i>

567
00:47:43,018 --> 00:47:44,351
You okay, though?

568
00:47:44,385 --> 00:47:46,821
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

569
00:47:46,854 --> 00:47:48,622
How was the drive down?
Was it not too long?

570
00:47:48,656 --> 00:47:50,858
<i>It was good, but when
you get in the city,</i>

571
00:47:50,891 --> 00:47:52,793
<i>the traffic's terrible.</i>

572
00:47:52,827 --> 00:47:55,096
It takes like 20 minutes
to go a mile.

573
00:47:56,831 --> 00:47:58,099
And Vance and Kimberly's?

574
00:47:58,133 --> 00:47:59,633
Yeah, yeah, it's great.

575
00:47:59,667 --> 00:48:01,702
The, um... The place is amazing.

576
00:48:01,735 --> 00:48:03,604
It's like...

577
00:48:03,637 --> 00:48:05,840
It's huge. It's like a palace.

578
00:48:05,873 --> 00:48:06,975
Nice.

579
00:48:08,143 --> 00:48:10,744
<i>I'm really glad, Tess.</i>

580
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:15,649
- I'm sorry I hurt you.
- <i>You don't...</i>

581
00:48:15,683 --> 00:48:17,718
No, I...

582
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,156
I just want you to be happy.

583
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:22,656
You deserve to be happy.

584
00:48:24,825 --> 00:48:26,427
It's cool that you're boxing.

585
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:29,164
I know, right?
I really fucking like it.

586
00:48:29,197 --> 00:48:30,999
It's nice to be able
to punch people

587
00:48:31,032 --> 00:48:32,533
and not have anyone
call the police.

588
00:48:34,768 --> 00:48:37,105
I think that
that's a step forward.

589
00:48:38,739 --> 00:48:40,141
Right?

590
00:48:41,475 --> 00:48:42,843
I'm trying a new approach.

591
00:48:42,877 --> 00:48:44,912
Hardin. This is not
leisure hour. Come on.

592
00:48:44,945 --> 00:48:47,615
I really have to go now,
but I'm so glad you called.

593
00:48:47,648 --> 00:48:49,683
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

594
00:48:49,717 --> 00:48:51,152
All right. We'll talk soon.

595
00:48:51,186 --> 00:48:53,520
- <i>Bye, Tess.</i>
- Bye.

596
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:08,435
- Yes.
- He's a pretty boy.

597
00:49:08,469 --> 00:49:11,106
You scared to fight Landon?
You heard... oh, shit!

598
00:49:11,139 --> 00:49:12,773
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

599
00:49:23,084 --> 00:49:25,153
Vance publishing, please hold.

600
00:49:31,226 --> 00:49:33,228
Selfies, huh?

601
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:38,199
No, I was... I was just
showing hardin my new office.

602
00:49:38,233 --> 00:49:39,867
Mm-hm.

603
00:49:42,070 --> 00:49:43,871
Seattle looks good on you.

604
00:49:59,954 --> 00:50:02,589
So how's it going?

605
00:50:04,025 --> 00:50:08,063
Fine. Yeah.
I mean, work, school.

606
00:50:08,096 --> 00:50:10,698
It's a lot, but it's fine.

607
00:50:10,731 --> 00:50:12,933
Give it time. You'll settle in.

608
00:50:12,967 --> 00:50:15,869
You'll find a place.
It's exciting.

609
00:50:15,903 --> 00:50:18,073
Are you sure
that you don't want a glass?

610
00:50:19,807 --> 00:50:23,011
I think she might be
on to us, darling.

611
00:50:23,044 --> 00:50:28,249
Well, we have some news.

612
00:50:28,283 --> 00:50:30,085
We just found out...

613
00:50:30,118 --> 00:50:31,919
We're having a baby.

614
00:50:31,952 --> 00:50:35,556
Are you kidding?
I'm so happy for you guys.

615
00:50:35,589 --> 00:50:37,925
I'm gonna tell hardin though,
if that's all right with you.

616
00:50:37,958 --> 00:50:39,260
Yeah, yeah, of course.

617
00:50:39,294 --> 00:50:40,961
Ken mentioned that he'd managed

618
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:43,630
to get his gpa up to a 4.0.

619
00:50:43,664 --> 00:50:45,733
He must be looking forward
to graduating.

620
00:50:45,766 --> 00:50:50,671
Yeah, that's great.
Um, I didn't even know that.

621
00:50:50,704 --> 00:50:51,805
It's because of you.

622
00:50:53,574 --> 00:50:55,310
I mean,
I didn't write his papers.

623
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:58,946
No, well...
Maybe not, I'm sure he did that.

624
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:01,316
But, well, he has got
a gift, that boy.

625
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:02,816
But he's stubborn as hell.

626
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:04,085
You're one to talk.

627
00:51:05,186 --> 00:51:07,088
Touché.

628
00:51:10,325 --> 00:51:12,193
Well, I should get some sleep,

629
00:51:12,227 --> 00:51:14,029
but I will see
you guys tomorrow?

630
00:51:14,062 --> 00:51:15,997
Yeah, of course.

631
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:18,099
And you should take this.

632
00:51:18,133 --> 00:51:20,068
It's too nice of a bottle
to go to waste.

633
00:51:20,101 --> 00:51:21,835
- Yes, please.
- Don't worry about me.

634
00:51:21,869 --> 00:51:23,238
I won't have any.

635
00:51:23,271 --> 00:51:25,806
- You don't need any more.
- Good night, darling.

636
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:27,775
- Good night.
- You have to suffer like me.

637
00:51:33,014 --> 00:51:36,650
There you are.
I just got back from the gym.

638
00:51:36,683 --> 00:51:38,119
<i>You did?</i>

639
00:51:38,153 --> 00:51:42,856
Wow, you must be getting
pretty good.

640
00:51:45,093 --> 00:51:46,361
Are you drunk?

641
00:51:46,394 --> 00:51:48,629
I was hanging out
with Vance and Kimberly,

642
00:51:48,662 --> 00:51:51,932
and she gave me
the rest of the bottle.

643
00:51:51,965 --> 00:51:53,101
Oh, yeah?

644
00:51:53,134 --> 00:51:55,170
So how much wine have you had?

645
00:51:55,203 --> 00:51:58,306
I'm on my...

646
00:51:58,339 --> 00:51:59,807
Third?

647
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:04,979
<i>You were actually
quite the topic.</i>

648
00:52:05,013 --> 00:52:06,914
You didn't answer
my call earlier.

649
00:52:06,947 --> 00:52:10,784
<i>No, I know. I've been at work
since, like, 8:00.</i>

650
00:52:10,818 --> 00:52:12,287
Except for taking
office selfies.

651
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:15,856
- Which you didn't respond to.
- Tessa.

652
00:52:15,889 --> 00:52:17,891
Hardin Allen Scott.

653
00:52:19,726 --> 00:52:20,995
Why are you laughing?

654
00:52:21,029 --> 00:52:23,264
It's just all so ridiculous.

655
00:52:24,765 --> 00:52:27,001
I think you need
to put that wine down.

656
00:52:27,035 --> 00:52:28,869
Make me.

657
00:52:28,902 --> 00:52:30,771
Well, I would if I was there.

658
00:52:30,804 --> 00:52:33,208
<i>What else would you make me do?</i>

659
00:52:34,409 --> 00:52:35,909
<i>Theresa Lynn young,</i>

660
00:52:35,943 --> 00:52:38,313
are you trying
to have phone sex with me?

661
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:42,984
Tell me what you would do
if you were here.

662
00:52:44,751 --> 00:52:47,955
- Are you lying in your bed?
- <i>Mm-hm.</i>

663
00:52:47,989 --> 00:52:49,357
<i>Close your eyes.</i>

664
00:52:50,891 --> 00:52:52,893
- Are they closed?
- <i>Mm-hm.</i>

665
00:52:52,926 --> 00:52:54,095
Are you sure?

666
00:53:12,913 --> 00:53:15,916
Fuck, I wish I was there
watching you right now.

667
00:53:15,949 --> 00:53:19,420
You like that, don't you?
Watching me?

668
00:53:20,921 --> 00:53:22,423
Fuck, yeah, I do.

669
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:29,063
<i>How'd you sleep?</i>

670
00:53:30,398 --> 00:53:31,432
<i>Good.</i>

671
00:53:32,733 --> 00:53:35,036
Not as good as I do with you.

672
00:53:35,069 --> 00:53:36,937
I know the feeling.

673
00:53:39,207 --> 00:53:42,910
Come here. I miss you.

674
00:53:42,943 --> 00:53:45,113
I miss you too.

675
00:53:45,146 --> 00:53:47,948
Don't say "too." It sounds like
you're just agreeing with me.

676
00:53:53,354 --> 00:53:55,456
I love you.

677
00:53:55,490 --> 00:53:57,091
I love you.

678
00:54:23,784 --> 00:54:26,354
Tessa? Tessa?

679
00:54:27,888 --> 00:54:31,426
Tess! No, no, no, Tessa! Tessa!

680
00:54:33,494 --> 00:54:37,065
Tessa! Tessa!

681
00:54:37,098 --> 00:54:38,299
Tess!

682
00:54:38,333 --> 00:54:40,101
No, no, no!

683
00:54:44,539 --> 00:54:46,441
- I love you.
- I love you too.

684
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:51,279
Fuck you! No, no!

685
00:55:25,346 --> 00:55:27,315
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

686
00:55:29,950 --> 00:55:32,320
What... what are you doing here?

687
00:55:32,353 --> 00:55:35,423
Well, I came to see you.
But I can leave.

688
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:39,394
No.

689
00:55:41,596 --> 00:55:43,331
- I'm gonna get my bags.
- Mm-mm.

690
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:51,039
Give us a hand.

691
00:55:53,041 --> 00:55:55,209
What's the fastest
train you've been on?

692
00:55:55,243 --> 00:55:57,111
- There's this train in Japan.
- Oh, hey!

693
00:55:57,145 --> 00:55:58,413
- Hey, hey.
- Hardin.

694
00:55:58,446 --> 00:55:59,580
Smith, what's up?

695
00:55:59,614 --> 00:56:01,182
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

696
00:56:01,215 --> 00:56:02,517
He asked if he could stay,

697
00:56:02,550 --> 00:56:05,119
and I thought you might
be all right with that.

698
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:07,488
It's a lovely place.
Where should I drop my stuff?

699
00:56:07,522 --> 00:56:09,223
- Uh, let me show you.
- Cool.

700
00:56:09,257 --> 00:56:11,125
I'll call you guys
when dinner's ready.

701
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:13,494
- Sounds good.
- It's this way.

702
00:56:13,528 --> 00:56:15,962
It's nice to see
a smile back on her face.

703
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:16,997
It is.

704
00:56:23,471 --> 00:56:26,240
So, um, I found this.

705
00:56:27,442 --> 00:56:28,942
And I'm really sorry,

706
00:56:28,976 --> 00:56:31,279
but once I picked it up,
I couldn't put it down.

707
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:42,390
You're a brilliant writer, Tess.

708
00:56:42,423 --> 00:56:44,592
And I came across
that page about pain

709
00:56:44,625 --> 00:56:47,161
and I just wanted to apologize.

710
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:49,197
The way I made you feel
is inexcusable.

711
00:56:49,230 --> 00:56:51,499
So I'm sorry.

712
00:56:51,532 --> 00:56:54,469
I didn't mean for you
to read any of this...

713
00:56:54,502 --> 00:56:56,371
- I'm sure you didn't.
- It's pretty raw.

714
00:56:57,572 --> 00:56:59,073
I needed to hear it.

715
00:57:00,408 --> 00:57:02,009
In your words.

716
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:05,046
And I fucking hate myself

717
00:57:05,079 --> 00:57:07,482
for making you feel that way,
but I'm sorry.

718
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:14,155
Thank you.

719
00:57:14,188 --> 00:57:15,656
Hey! Steaks are on!

720
00:57:18,726 --> 00:57:20,261
Be right there!

721
00:57:26,967 --> 00:57:28,703
Oh.

722
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:30,138
Will we?

723
00:57:36,644 --> 00:57:38,646
<i>I love you too.</i>

724
00:57:41,282 --> 00:57:43,551
We shouldn't keep them waiting.

725
00:57:43,584 --> 00:57:46,187
What? I mean,
I'm sure that they're fine.

726
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:47,388
Come on, I'm hungry.

727
00:57:54,495 --> 00:57:56,664
He really wants me to go.
He keeps talking

728
00:57:56,697 --> 00:57:59,233
about me wearing the hat
and the gown and everything.

729
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:02,236
- What's so bad about that?
- It just looks ridiculous.

730
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:04,481
Can you imagine me in the hat
and the gown and everything?

731
00:58:04,505 --> 00:58:06,107
I don't even wanna go
to the ceremony.

732
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:08,176
I can't imagine it,
but I really wanna see it.

733
00:58:09,510 --> 00:58:11,746
You gotta celebrate
your accomplishments.

734
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:13,614
You don't wanna
look back and regret

735
00:58:13,648 --> 00:58:16,083
having not had
those experiences.

736
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:18,519
Trust me, I know firsthand.

737
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:22,690
- I'll give it some thought.
- I think you should.

738
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:25,693
- Hey, buddy.
- Hi.

739
00:58:25,726 --> 00:58:27,562
This needs turning,
do you wanna do it?

740
00:58:27,595 --> 00:58:30,031
- Why not?
- Okay. There you go. Grab that.

741
00:58:30,064 --> 00:58:33,534
- This is really nice.
- Yeah.

742
00:58:33,568 --> 00:58:38,272
You know, all of us
together, under one roof.

743
00:58:39,373 --> 00:58:41,576
- Here we all are.
- Yeah.

744
00:58:43,377 --> 00:58:47,381
- Well, tonight, anyway.
- Oh, come on.

745
00:58:47,415 --> 00:58:49,717
You two will work it out.

746
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:51,652
Sometimes distance is
a good thing.

747
00:58:51,686 --> 00:58:52,987
Mmm.

748
00:58:54,121 --> 00:58:55,121
You think so?

749
00:58:56,724 --> 00:58:58,392
Honestly, I have no idea.

750
00:59:01,529 --> 00:59:04,699
Look, relationships...

751
00:59:07,235 --> 00:59:08,569
They're complicated.

752
01:00:21,309 --> 01:00:22,343
Hey.

753
01:00:40,261 --> 01:00:41,462
Did I do something?

754
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:48,469
You've barely said a word to me
the whole night.

755
01:01:02,283 --> 01:01:04,685
I had this horrible dream
of you and Robert.

756
01:01:07,655 --> 01:01:10,658
I can't get it
out of my fucking head.

757
01:01:16,664 --> 01:01:19,266
But I'm here with you.

758
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:24,705
That's exactly it.

759
01:01:30,244 --> 01:01:33,414
I can't help but think that
you should be with someone else.

760
01:01:36,617 --> 01:01:38,719
Your life would be
so much easier.

761
01:01:44,592 --> 01:01:45,926
There's all this bad shit

762
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:48,329
that I've been trying
to suppress for so long.

763
01:01:48,362 --> 01:01:49,764
It's just all coming up.

764
01:01:50,965 --> 01:01:52,800
And there's nothing I can do.

765
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:57,304
The thought of losing you
is just, heh...

766
01:01:57,338 --> 01:01:59,407
It's pretty fucking dark
in here, Tess.

767
01:02:05,546 --> 01:02:07,314
Why didn't you just tell me?

768
01:02:07,348 --> 01:02:09,483
That's the whole point
of being open...

769
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:12,853
Because it's a burden for me,
and I don't wanna burden you.

770
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:27,702
I don't want to be
with anyone else.

771
01:02:29,837 --> 01:02:31,539
I wanna be with you.

772
01:02:35,743 --> 01:02:36,844
Hey.

773
01:03:02,303 --> 01:03:04,739
Fuck me until
you forget about that dream.

774
01:04:05,699 --> 01:04:07,468
Oh, fuck.

775
01:04:09,537 --> 01:04:13,374
Look in the mirror.

776
01:04:15,743 --> 01:04:17,979
Oh, yes, baby.

777
01:04:18,013 --> 01:04:20,714
- You close?
- Yeah.

778
01:05:00,989 --> 01:05:02,957
We didn't
use protection last night.

779
01:05:05,893 --> 01:05:07,394
Yeah, I know.

780
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:11,832
I'll have to go
to the drugstore tonight.

781
01:05:11,866 --> 01:05:13,968
I should get on the pill anyway.

782
01:05:18,639 --> 01:05:19,639
Yeah.

783
01:05:21,009 --> 01:05:23,577
Yeah, you with no condom,
on a regular basis,

784
01:05:23,611 --> 01:05:25,113
that's gonna work for me.

785
01:05:36,924 --> 01:05:38,392
Here are the kids.

786
01:05:42,463 --> 01:05:43,764
Hey, hey.

787
01:05:43,797 --> 01:05:46,467
You look in better spirits
this morning.

788
01:05:47,968 --> 01:05:51,039
Yeah, think I just needed
a good night's sleep.

789
01:05:55,110 --> 01:05:56,978
Oh, it's mom. One sec, guys.

790
01:05:57,012 --> 01:05:58,980
- Hi, mom.
- <i>Hi, my love.</i>

791
01:05:59,014 --> 01:06:00,148
<i>How are you doing?</i>

792
01:06:00,181 --> 01:06:02,183
Good, thanks. How are you?

793
01:06:02,217 --> 01:06:05,220
That must be about the wedding.

794
01:06:05,253 --> 01:06:06,620
Uh, whose wedding?

795
01:06:08,722 --> 01:06:11,892
- Trish is...? Oh, my god.
- Yeah.

796
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:13,995
- Yeah.
- Oh, that's amazing.

797
01:06:14,029 --> 01:06:15,896
She deserves it.

798
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:20,801
Yeah. And Mike is a good guy.
So he'll look after her.

799
01:06:20,834 --> 01:06:22,903
- Okay, let's go.
- Oh!

800
01:06:22,937 --> 01:06:24,972
- Okay.
- Come on, bud.

801
01:06:26,607 --> 01:06:27,808
- Smith.
- What?

802
01:06:27,841 --> 01:06:29,010
Hey, hey, hey! Backpack.

803
01:06:30,611 --> 01:06:31,812
Hey.

804
01:06:33,114 --> 01:06:36,251
- Bye.
- Bye.

805
01:06:36,284 --> 01:06:38,919
I will, I will, I will.
All right.

806
01:06:38,953 --> 01:06:40,088
Bye.

807
01:06:45,859 --> 01:06:49,130
What? What?

808
01:06:49,164 --> 01:06:50,198
So?

809
01:06:51,966 --> 01:06:55,970
So, what do you wanna do today?

810
01:08:26,361 --> 01:08:29,730
- Got everything?
- Yep.

811
01:08:41,742 --> 01:08:42,943
There's nothing...

812
01:08:42,977 --> 01:08:44,845
There's nothing
you've forgotten?

813
01:08:47,282 --> 01:08:49,950
No, I think I'm good.

814
01:08:54,055 --> 01:08:57,158
What happened to our not keeping
secrets from each other?

815
01:08:57,192 --> 01:08:59,893
- What are you on about?
- You're not gonna tell me

816
01:08:59,927 --> 01:09:01,362
about your mom's wedding?

817
01:09:02,863 --> 01:09:03,863
Tess...

818
01:09:05,699 --> 01:09:07,202
The only reason
I haven't told you

819
01:09:07,235 --> 01:09:09,803
- is because I don't want to go.
- Okay. Why...

820
01:09:09,837 --> 01:09:11,306
Why don't you wanna go?

821
01:09:11,339 --> 01:09:13,640
I thought you wanted
to show me your hometown.

822
01:09:13,674 --> 01:09:18,413
I wanna show you London. I do
not wanna show you my hometown.

823
01:09:18,446 --> 01:09:20,814
If you don't wanna bring me,
I think that that's fine.

824
01:09:20,848 --> 01:09:22,950
But it's her big day.

825
01:09:22,984 --> 01:09:25,253
I really think
you need to be there for her.

826
01:09:25,286 --> 01:09:28,922
If I was going,
I would bring you, but...

827
01:09:28,956 --> 01:09:30,992
Do you know what,
I'll think about it.

828
01:09:31,025 --> 01:09:33,394
- Okay?
- Okay.

829
01:09:33,428 --> 01:09:35,829
Hey, this was a good weekend.

830
01:09:35,863 --> 01:09:38,166
- How good?
- This good.

831
01:09:40,435 --> 01:09:42,403
Better.

832
01:09:42,437 --> 01:09:46,241
Can you come back on Wednesday?
Vance is having an event.

833
01:09:48,176 --> 01:09:49,743
I'll try.

834
01:09:56,017 --> 01:09:57,218
Okay.

835
01:11:02,317 --> 01:11:04,018
Richard?

836
01:11:04,052 --> 01:11:05,886
I nearly smashed
your fucking head in!

837
01:11:07,455 --> 01:11:09,756
What the fuck are you thinking,
breaking in here?

838
01:11:09,790 --> 01:11:12,293
You weren't here, and, uh...

839
01:11:12,327 --> 01:11:14,761
Tess told me
where you keep the key.

840
01:11:14,795 --> 01:11:17,365
You look like shit.

841
01:11:17,398 --> 01:11:20,968
Yeah, well, uh, I owe a guy.

842
01:11:21,002 --> 01:11:23,504
- How much are you in for?
- Five hundred.

843
01:11:45,093 --> 01:11:46,093
You can take this.

844
01:11:50,265 --> 01:11:51,299
Here.

845
01:11:53,834 --> 01:11:55,902
My dad gave me that.

846
01:11:55,936 --> 01:11:56,970
I never wear it.

847
01:11:58,506 --> 01:12:00,941
It's worth a lot more
than what you need, so...

848
01:12:00,975 --> 01:12:01,975
Thanks.

849
01:12:03,244 --> 01:12:05,079
Yeah.

850
01:12:06,614 --> 01:12:08,516
I'm gonna get better for her.

851
01:12:11,386 --> 01:12:12,420
I'm gonna get better.

852
01:12:13,521 --> 01:12:15,056
I promise.

853
01:12:28,036 --> 01:12:30,104
This should protect you
from pregnancy

854
01:12:30,138 --> 01:12:32,173
for the next three months.

855
01:12:32,206 --> 01:12:34,442
My concern is...

856
01:12:34,475 --> 01:12:36,444
You may not need it.

857
01:12:36,477 --> 01:12:39,547
<i>It's your cervix.</i>

858
01:12:39,580 --> 01:12:41,983
<i>You may not be able
to get pregnant.</i>

859
01:12:42,016 --> 01:12:44,319
<i>We need to do more tests
before we know.</i>

860
01:13:05,373 --> 01:13:07,408
Hmm.

861
01:13:07,442 --> 01:13:09,043
As much as I'd like to help,

862
01:13:09,077 --> 01:13:10,978
by the time you apply
for the transfer,

863
01:13:11,012 --> 01:13:13,281
you register and start classes,

864
01:13:13,314 --> 01:13:15,149
I don't think
it's worth the hassle.

865
01:13:15,183 --> 01:13:16,917
And I don't think
you're gonna get

866
01:13:16,950 --> 01:13:18,419
the classes you need
to graduate.

867
01:13:18,453 --> 01:13:20,154
I figured
you were gonna say this.

868
01:13:20,188 --> 01:13:23,057
- Just thought I'd give it a try.
- It's only two months.

869
01:13:23,091 --> 01:13:25,493
And you know, it's been
one of my biggest dreams

870
01:13:25,526 --> 01:13:28,329
to see you graduate.

871
01:13:28,363 --> 01:13:30,531
I guess it hasn't always
been a given, has it?

872
01:13:30,565 --> 01:13:33,034
No, no. It hasn't.

873
01:13:33,067 --> 01:13:36,270
It has been a gift,
having you here.

874
01:13:36,304 --> 01:13:40,408
And I'm grateful that you were
willing to give me a chance

875
01:13:40,441 --> 01:13:41,908
to see me sober.

876
01:13:43,010 --> 01:13:44,178
Yeah.

877
01:13:46,414 --> 01:13:47,415
When was that?

878
01:13:48,683 --> 01:13:51,319
Oh, that was freshman year.

879
01:13:51,352 --> 01:13:53,087
Your mom, Vance and I.

880
01:13:54,555 --> 01:13:56,090
Never seen it before.

881
01:13:57,658 --> 01:13:59,926
You know she's getting married.

882
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:01,396
- To Mike?
- To Mike.

883
01:14:01,429 --> 01:14:04,365
Oh, good for her. He always
seemed like a nice guy.

884
01:14:04,399 --> 01:14:07,668
I've always thought he was a bit
of a wanker, but if she's happy.

885
01:14:08,969 --> 01:14:10,238
Two months!

886
01:14:10,271 --> 01:14:11,506
It's just gonna go like...

887
01:14:44,105 --> 01:14:46,207
- Hey!
- Hello.

888
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:47,675
Don't you two look gorgeous.

889
01:14:47,708 --> 01:14:49,110
Obviously.

890
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:54,215
Relax, it's soda water.

891
01:14:54,248 --> 01:14:57,118
- Did you tell him? Did...?
- Vance called me.

892
01:14:57,151 --> 01:15:00,488
- Oh.
- Well, enjoy.

893
01:15:01,722 --> 01:15:04,091
- I have to go play hostess.
- Okay.

894
01:15:08,496 --> 01:15:11,332
They were ecstatic when
I told them you were coming.

895
01:15:11,365 --> 01:15:12,533
What, just them?

896
01:15:14,068 --> 01:15:17,405
Well, I was... I was happy.

897
01:15:18,539 --> 01:15:20,374
Um...

898
01:15:20,408 --> 01:15:22,543
I do have some bad news.

899
01:15:22,577 --> 01:15:23,978
Oh. Uh, what?

900
01:15:25,646 --> 01:15:28,216
It's not looking like
I'm gonna be able to get here

901
01:15:28,249 --> 01:15:31,018
- for another two months.
- What, uh...?

902
01:15:31,052 --> 01:15:32,687
What do you mean, like visit?

903
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:34,555
Wait, what?

904
01:15:34,589 --> 01:15:37,091
What? What do you mean?

905
01:15:37,124 --> 01:15:39,026
I mean, like, for good.

906
01:15:41,496 --> 01:15:45,066
Like... uh, wait.

907
01:15:45,099 --> 01:15:48,169
- Do you mean like move here?
- It's two months, though.

908
01:15:48,202 --> 01:15:50,171
- I wonder if I should even...
- Are you serious?

909
01:15:50,204 --> 01:15:53,140
Should I call the whole thing
off? Maybe I should cancel it.

910
01:15:53,174 --> 01:15:55,710
- I love you so much.
- I love you.

911
01:15:57,812 --> 01:16:02,283
Hate to break it up,
but I wanna dance!

912
01:16:02,316 --> 01:16:04,151
Come on!

913
01:16:04,185 --> 01:16:06,087
How are you, my boy?

914
01:16:10,725 --> 01:16:12,760
- There's my boy.
- Hey.

915
01:16:12,793 --> 01:16:15,830
- How are you?
- Never better.

916
01:16:23,771 --> 01:16:27,074
- I gotta go to work.
- Go ahead.

917
01:17:39,614 --> 01:17:42,883
- Let's go. Right now. Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

918
01:17:52,893 --> 01:17:54,662
You're moving here.

919
01:17:57,965 --> 01:17:59,934
Yeah.

920
01:18:25,793 --> 01:18:27,662
Right.

921
01:18:27,695 --> 01:18:30,564
- Your elbows are up again.
- Oh, man.

922
01:18:30,598 --> 01:18:31,799
All right, then.

923
01:18:33,534 --> 01:18:35,202
You looking forward
to visiting home?

924
01:18:35,236 --> 01:18:36,504
I know I am.

925
01:18:38,006 --> 01:18:39,707
Oh, I see.

926
01:18:39,740 --> 01:18:42,610
Celebrating your mom's happiness
doesn't sound appealing?

927
01:18:42,643 --> 01:18:44,812
It's not that.

928
01:18:44,845 --> 01:18:46,414
So, what's going on?

929
01:18:49,884 --> 01:18:51,485
I really want to bring Tessa,

930
01:18:51,519 --> 01:18:53,821
but I don't want to bring her
around my old life.

931
01:18:53,854 --> 01:18:55,690
It's just a sad house
in a sad place.

932
01:19:00,261 --> 01:19:03,631
Has she ever made you feel badly
about your past?

933
01:19:03,664 --> 01:19:06,634
- No.
- The only way you can find out

934
01:19:06,667 --> 01:19:10,337
if you trust her
is to trust her.

935
01:19:10,371 --> 01:19:12,907
And it'd mean the world to
Trish, having you both there.

936
01:19:19,613 --> 01:19:21,348
Look. Seriously, mate.

937
01:19:23,451 --> 01:19:26,787
Your wedding is
a moment that's...

938
01:19:28,622 --> 01:19:31,892
Bigger than anything else
that you can possibly imagine.

939
01:19:31,926 --> 01:19:34,695
- Kind of changes you.
- Mm-hm.

940
01:19:34,729 --> 01:19:36,597
And that's why
they all fail, right?

941
01:19:36,630 --> 01:19:37,999
Not all of them.

942
01:19:38,033 --> 01:19:39,900
Not if you find the right one.

943
01:19:42,070 --> 01:19:45,406
You know, I believe

944
01:19:45,439 --> 01:19:48,943
that you have
two real great loves.

945
01:19:48,977 --> 01:19:52,646
So in your case,
that would be Tessa and you.

946
01:19:56,517 --> 01:19:58,753
You gonna show me what you got?

947
01:19:58,786 --> 01:20:00,621
- Yeah. Come on, then.
- Aah!

948
01:20:17,805 --> 01:20:19,774
I got us tickets to england.

949
01:20:23,011 --> 01:20:24,411
Mmm...

950
01:20:42,097 --> 01:20:44,698
- Keep the change.
- Don't worry, mom. I'll get it.

951
01:20:44,732 --> 01:20:46,934
- No, no, no. I've got it.
- Hi.

952
01:20:46,967 --> 01:20:48,969
Oh, it's so good
to see you both.

953
01:20:49,004 --> 01:20:51,539
Jesus, Tessa.
Is there a body in there?

954
01:20:51,572 --> 01:20:53,674
I didn't know how much I'd need.

955
01:20:53,707 --> 01:20:55,043
Here you go.

956
01:20:55,076 --> 01:20:56,410
Thank you.

957
01:20:56,443 --> 01:20:57,945
How was the flight?

958
01:20:57,979 --> 01:20:59,713
Sorry it's not more comfortable.

959
01:20:59,747 --> 01:21:02,516
I didn't expect the house
to sell on the first day.

960
01:21:02,550 --> 01:21:04,385
No, it's great.

961
01:21:04,418 --> 01:21:06,054
I left your bed up, hardin.

962
01:21:07,721 --> 01:21:09,857
I wasn't expecting
to sleep on the floor.

963
01:21:11,092 --> 01:21:13,594
It's perfect. Thank you.

964
01:21:13,627 --> 01:21:15,096
Well, you guys
must be exhausted.

965
01:21:15,130 --> 01:21:16,697
So I'll leave you to it.

966
01:21:16,730 --> 01:21:19,400
I'm staying next door at Mike's.

967
01:21:19,433 --> 01:21:20,534
Okay.

968
01:21:23,038 --> 01:21:24,872
Hey, give me a sec...

969
01:21:24,905 --> 01:21:27,875
- We're really happy for you.
- Thank you.

970
01:21:27,908 --> 01:21:30,045
I'm glad you came.

971
01:21:30,078 --> 01:21:32,479
I've gotta go to
the bridal store in the morning.

972
01:21:32,513 --> 01:21:34,049
I was wondering,
do you wanna come?

973
01:21:34,082 --> 01:21:37,751
- Yeah, I'd love to. That's...
- Great. Great.

974
01:21:37,785 --> 01:21:39,553
- Call me if you need me.
- Okay.

975
01:21:39,587 --> 01:21:40,721
- Bye.
- Bye.

976
01:21:44,025 --> 01:21:46,694
Don't take any of my stuff
or go in my room,

977
01:21:46,727 --> 01:21:48,662
and definitely don't have
any friends over, okay?

978
01:21:48,696 --> 01:21:51,498
<i>Yeah, yeah.
Hey, thanks for letting me stay here.</i>

979
01:21:51,532 --> 01:21:53,734
Yeah, well, don't thank me,
because it's not permanent.

980
01:21:53,767 --> 01:21:55,070
<i>Yeah, yeah. I know.</i>

981
01:21:55,103 --> 01:21:57,038
Make sure you call
if there's a problem.

982
01:21:57,072 --> 01:21:59,107
<i>Sure thing, hardin. Bye.</i>

983
01:22:03,777 --> 01:22:05,846
Who was that?

984
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:07,715
That was a random homeless man

985
01:22:07,748 --> 01:22:09,683
who I've been letting sleep
on my couch.

986
01:22:09,717 --> 01:22:12,020
All the hipsters
are doing it these days.

987
01:22:16,523 --> 01:22:18,926
- Thank you.
- Of course.

988
01:22:33,241 --> 01:22:35,676
- There's nothing to eat.
- What are you looking for?

989
01:22:35,709 --> 01:22:37,511
I don't know. Something edible.

990
01:22:37,544 --> 01:22:39,981
That I don't have to cook,
preferably.

991
01:22:40,015 --> 01:22:42,850
Look, why don't you take
the keys and go to sainsbury's.

992
01:22:42,883 --> 01:22:45,452
It'll give you something to do
when we're gone.

993
01:22:46,654 --> 01:22:47,655
Hi.

994
01:22:47,688 --> 01:22:49,024
- You ready?
- Yep.

995
01:22:53,194 --> 01:22:54,962
Are you sure
you're not jet-lagged?

996
01:22:54,996 --> 01:22:56,773
- I feel fine.
- You don't have to go, you know.

997
01:22:56,797 --> 01:22:57,797
Hardin.

998
01:23:00,668 --> 01:23:03,038
Come on, Tessa. Let's do this.

999
01:23:38,739 --> 01:23:40,817
I really shouldn't. I'm sorry,
guys. Have one for me.

1000
01:23:40,841 --> 01:23:42,210
Hey, man. Come on. Man.

1001
01:23:51,987 --> 01:23:54,488
Yep. That's it.

1002
01:24:00,627 --> 01:24:02,730
You really look amazing.

1003
01:24:04,732 --> 01:24:06,834
It's beginning to feel real.

1004
01:24:10,771 --> 01:24:12,207
What's her dress like?

1005
01:24:13,640 --> 01:24:16,710
Mmm... I can't tell you.

1006
01:24:18,179 --> 01:24:19,913
You're seriously
not gonna tell me?

1007
01:24:19,947 --> 01:24:21,216
Yeah, I can't tell you.

1008
01:24:21,249 --> 01:24:23,284
You're gonna
have to wait and see.

1009
01:24:25,853 --> 01:24:27,721
Don't care that much anyway.

1010
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:34,728
Please tell me.

1011
01:24:34,762 --> 01:24:36,663
No, I won't tell you.

1012
01:24:42,669 --> 01:24:44,105
I'm so glad you came.

1013
01:24:46,241 --> 01:24:49,010
You're my better place, Tess.

1014
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:42,130
- What the fuck?!
- Oh, fu...!

1015
01:25:42,163 --> 01:25:46,000
Vance! Fucking hell!

1016
01:25:46,034 --> 01:25:49,736
- It's not what you think.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

1017
01:25:49,770 --> 01:25:52,173
Well, it clearly fucking is!

1018
01:25:52,207 --> 01:25:53,874
You're getting married tomorrow.

1019
01:25:53,907 --> 01:25:56,743
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1020
01:25:56,777 --> 01:25:58,246
The love of your life, Kimberly,

1021
01:25:58,279 --> 01:26:00,315
is carrying your child
while you're here...

1022
01:26:00,348 --> 01:26:02,150
- That's enough!
- What is wrong with you?

1023
01:26:02,183 --> 01:26:03,884
Hardin?

1024
01:26:03,917 --> 01:26:05,320
- Vance?
- Yeah.

1025
01:26:05,353 --> 01:26:06,954
He's been fucking my mom!

1026
01:26:06,988 --> 01:26:08,789
Please, hardin, just stop it!

1027
01:26:08,822 --> 01:26:10,992
Don't yell at me. You don't
get to tell me what to do.

1028
01:26:11,025 --> 01:26:13,361
You were getting fucked
on the counter like a slag.

1029
01:26:13,394 --> 01:26:14,996
Don't you talk to your mom
like that.

1030
01:26:15,029 --> 01:26:16,663
- Oh, fuck off!
- Hey.

1031
01:26:16,697 --> 01:26:18,899
Who the fuck are you
to tell me what to do, huh?

1032
01:26:18,932 --> 01:26:20,743
- You really want to know?
- No, Christian, don't.

1033
01:26:20,767 --> 01:26:22,836
- Enough, hardin!
- Stop, stop.

1034
01:26:22,870 --> 01:26:25,806
- Hardin, please stop it!
- Stop it! Ugh!

1035
01:26:25,839 --> 01:26:27,808
Please, hardin.

1036
01:26:27,841 --> 01:26:30,145
Hardin, that's enough!

1037
01:26:30,178 --> 01:26:31,379
That's enough!

1038
01:26:32,846 --> 01:26:36,351
Enough. That's enough.

1039
01:26:36,384 --> 01:26:39,187
You're getting married tomorrow.
Did you forget?

1040
01:26:40,921 --> 01:26:43,992
Who the fuck does that?
What are you going to tell Mike?

1041
01:26:44,025 --> 01:26:47,162
Hardin, Christian and I...

1042
01:26:47,195 --> 01:26:48,662
- He's...
- What?

1043
01:26:53,301 --> 01:26:55,236
It's not that simple.

1044
01:27:03,844 --> 01:27:05,413
Okay, let's go.

1045
01:27:05,446 --> 01:27:06,981
- Tessa, don't.
- Let's go.

1046
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:14,788
Are you all right?

1047
01:27:43,051 --> 01:27:44,485
Can you...?

1048
01:28:00,535 --> 01:28:03,804
It's okay. It's okay.

1049
01:28:03,837 --> 01:28:06,374
It is not okay.

1050
01:28:06,407 --> 01:28:08,409
It's not okay.

1051
01:28:22,490 --> 01:28:27,028
- Please, don't ever let me go.
- I won't. I'll never let you go.

1052
01:28:36,970 --> 01:28:41,109
That even though
you're a superhero in my eyes,

1053
01:28:41,142 --> 01:28:43,144
you are still human.

1054
01:28:44,878 --> 01:28:48,483
Mike Richards,
do you take Trish Daniels

1055
01:28:48,516 --> 01:28:50,884
for better or worse?

1056
01:28:53,554 --> 01:28:54,788
I do.

1057
01:28:58,359 --> 01:28:59,994
I really do.

1058
01:29:04,299 --> 01:29:08,036
I'm happy to pronounce
you husband and wife.

1059
01:29:37,931 --> 01:29:39,610
- Hardin...
- I have nothing to say to you.

1060
01:29:39,634 --> 01:29:41,636
- Come on.
- Get the fuck off me!

1061
01:29:41,669 --> 01:29:44,072
Do you wanna go again, old man?

1062
01:29:44,105 --> 01:29:46,307
If that's what it takes, yeah.

1063
01:29:48,409 --> 01:29:52,613
- There's a bar in the hotel.
- A fucking bar?

1064
01:29:52,647 --> 01:29:54,082
It's just down the street.

1065
01:29:55,949 --> 01:29:57,585
I'll wait there for you.

1066
01:30:12,333 --> 01:30:14,335
I can come if you want me to.

1067
01:30:17,238 --> 01:30:20,141
But either way,
I think you should go.

1068
01:30:22,543 --> 01:30:24,945
She looks like
she doesn't need telling.

1069
01:30:24,979 --> 01:30:27,014
Yeah. She definitely knows.

1070
01:30:29,217 --> 01:30:31,952
I'm gonna go sit with her,
but if anything goes wrong,

1071
01:30:31,986 --> 01:30:33,521
just come find me.

1072
01:30:49,003 --> 01:30:52,240
I'm surprised to see you here.

1073
01:30:52,273 --> 01:30:53,474
Yeah.

1074
01:30:58,045 --> 01:31:02,383
I'm afraid I won't be able
to stay as angry as I am.

1075
01:31:04,252 --> 01:31:06,087
Trust me, I am.

1076
01:31:12,226 --> 01:31:16,130
But what do I do? I love him.

1077
01:31:16,164 --> 01:31:20,168
And I love the life we're
building, and I love Smith.

1078
01:31:34,248 --> 01:31:36,250
You wanted to talk, let's talk.

1079
01:31:44,125 --> 01:31:46,594
I know you feel betrayed.

1080
01:31:46,627 --> 01:31:49,030
I want to explain myself.

1081
01:31:49,063 --> 01:31:51,365
But I honestly don't know
where to begin.

1082
01:31:55,336 --> 01:31:58,206
- I guess that makes us done then.
- Look, listen.

1083
01:32:00,741 --> 01:32:02,743
You are so important
to me and your mom.

1084
01:32:02,777 --> 01:32:04,779
Are you serious?

1085
01:32:04,812 --> 01:32:07,448
Now you two want to play
some sort of united front?

1086
01:32:07,482 --> 01:32:09,717
- Fuck off with that.
- You wouldn't be so angry

1087
01:32:09,750 --> 01:32:11,385
if you didn't care.

1088
01:32:13,321 --> 01:32:17,124
You know, I wish I could say
I'm surprised...

1089
01:32:19,260 --> 01:32:20,595
But I'm not.

1090
01:32:22,497 --> 01:32:24,365
They have a history together.

1091
01:32:26,667 --> 01:32:29,437
One that I'm not sure
I can compete with.

1092
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:36,277
I was gonna tell you ages ago,
but your mom didn't want...

1093
01:32:38,813 --> 01:32:40,414
Tell me what?

1094
01:32:43,284 --> 01:32:44,519
Tell me what?

1095
01:32:56,697 --> 01:32:59,367
Hardin is Christian's son.

1096
01:33:11,746 --> 01:33:13,347
Fuck!

1097
01:33:13,381 --> 01:33:17,451
- You... what the fuck!
- I'm so sorry.

1098
01:33:17,485 --> 01:33:19,086
No!

1099
01:33:33,634 --> 01:33:35,136
I'm sorry.

1100
01:33:36,737 --> 01:33:38,339
I have to go.
