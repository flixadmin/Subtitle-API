1
00:00:07,342 --> 00:00:08,760
Nancy!

2
00:00:09,761 --> 00:00:11,304
Nancy!

3
00:00:11,387 --> 00:00:12,764
Come on, come on.

4
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:14,432
Nancy!

5
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:17,644
Where are you?

6
00:00:17,727 --> 00:00:20,772
Jonathan! Jonathan!

7
00:00:21,356 --> 00:00:22,941
Jonathan!

8
00:00:24,651 --> 00:00:26,361
Jonathan, I'm right here!

9
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:28,196
Nancy!

10
00:00:30,615 --> 00:00:31,741
Nancy!

11
00:00:32,617 --> 00:00:34,410
Jonathan, where are you?

12
00:00:34,494 --> 00:00:37,121
Jonathan!

13
00:00:37,205 --> 00:00:38,915
Jonathan!

14
00:00:38,998 --> 00:00:41,125
Jonathan, I'm right...
I'm right here!

15
00:00:41,209 --> 00:00:43,044
- Where are you?

16
00:00:43,127 --> 00:00:44,754
- I'm right here!
- Jonathan!

17
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:47,215
I'm right here! Nancy!

18
00:00:47,298 --> 00:00:51,511
- Just follow my voice!
- Jonathan!

19
00:00:51,594 --> 00:00:54,847
Follow my voice, Nancy, I'm right here!

20
00:00:58,768 --> 00:01:00,186
Nancy!

21
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:31,134
Nancy?

22
00:01:33,553 --> 00:01:34,721
Nancy.

23
00:01:36,973 --> 00:01:39,851
Nancy!
Follow my voice!

24
00:01:45,523 --> 00:01:46,774
Nancy?

25
00:01:53,615 --> 00:01:55,283
- Jonathan!
- Nancy!

26
00:02:10,465 --> 00:02:13,509
I got you.

27
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:37,760
I just don't understand
why we're coming out here.

28
00:03:37,844 --> 00:03:41,097
-She obviously doesn't wanna talk to you.
-That's... that's not it.

29
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,851
Oh, really? Because no girl
would ever blow off King Steve.

30
00:03:44,934 --> 00:03:47,603
She was acting weird.
I mean, something was wrong.

31
00:03:47,687 --> 00:03:49,605
So what?
Like, you're worried about her?

32
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:53,109
-What?
-Aw, you are.

33
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:55,903
-Aw, Steve has a heart.
-Would you just-- Stop.

34
00:03:55,987 --> 00:03:57,572
-Oh, Stevey's in love.
-Would you just shut up?

35
00:03:57,655 --> 00:03:58,990
-Who knew?
-Shut up!

36
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:00,408
Jeez.

37
00:04:01,993 --> 00:04:04,412
- Damn. Sorry.

38
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:12,211
So this is it, huh?
Princess' castle.

39
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,965
I'll just be a minute.

40
00:04:46,913 --> 00:04:48,331
Look, we gotta
go through this again.

41
00:04:48,414 --> 00:04:51,209
-I told you everything that I saw.
-Oh, gosh. Tell me again.

42
00:04:51,292 --> 00:04:53,628
-Upstairs or downstairs?
-Upstairs.

43
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:54,837
There was a laboratory.

44
00:04:54,921 --> 00:04:57,507
It was where they must do experiments
or something, and then there was...

45
00:04:58,716 --> 00:05:00,134
There was this kid's room.

46
00:05:00,218 --> 00:05:03,888
-How do you know it was a kid's room?
-More like a prison.

47
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:06,390
So why would you think
it was a kid's room, then?

48
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:07,850
Because, I told you,

49
00:05:07,934 --> 00:05:10,645
the size of the bed, there was a drawing,
there was a stuffed animal--

50
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:12,355
You didn't say
there was a drawing.

51
00:05:12,438 --> 00:05:14,273
Yeah, there was a drawing of a...
an adult and a child.

52
00:05:14,357 --> 00:05:16,692
-It said "Eleven" on it.
-Was it good?

53
00:05:16,776 --> 00:05:19,028
It was a kid's drawing, Joyce.
It was stick figures.

54
00:05:24,826 --> 00:05:26,786
Wasn't Will.

55
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:36,963
Earl...

56
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:39,840
The night that Benny died,

57
00:05:39,924 --> 00:05:45,221
Earl said he saw some kid
with a shaved head with Benny.

58
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:49,058
Now, I pressed him,
he said it might be Will, but maybe...

59
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:50,935
Wait... Maybe, it wasn't?

60
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:53,354
Look... this woman, Terry Ives,

61
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:55,523
she claims to have lost
her daughter, Jane.

62
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:58,025
She sued Brenner,
she sued the government...

63
00:05:58,109 --> 00:06:00,486
Now, the claims came to nothing,
but what if...

64
00:06:02,238 --> 00:06:04,699
I mean,
what if this whole time I've been...

65
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:06,450
I've been looking for Will...

66
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:09,495
I've been chasing after some other kid?

67
00:06:28,264 --> 00:06:29,265
Nancy!

68
00:06:47,742 --> 00:06:49,243
Better?

69
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:52,204
Yeah.

70
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:57,084
Is this okay?
Uh, I found it in the closet.

71
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:00,713
- I can go home.
- I just figured--

72
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:02,757
- Yeah, no.
- I...

73
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,136
- I don't wanna be alone.

74
00:07:08,054 --> 00:07:11,265
-Do you?
-No. Uh... no.

75
00:07:46,217 --> 00:07:48,219
Can you just come up here?

76
00:07:53,683 --> 00:07:54,809
Yeah.

77
00:08:06,404 --> 00:08:08,656
- Do you want the lights off, or--
- On.

78
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:11,158
Yeah.

79
00:08:14,996 --> 00:08:16,372
You know, it...

80
00:08:17,373 --> 00:08:19,208
it can't get us in here.

81
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:26,173
We don't know that.

82
00:09:31,072 --> 00:09:34,700
Uh, yeah, it's Ives.
Terry Ives. That's with a "Y."

83
00:09:34,784 --> 00:09:37,703
Yeah, I got a pen.
Hang on.

84
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:41,665
Mmm-hmm.

85
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:44,335
Mmm-hmm.

86
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:47,588
Great, thanks.
I really appreciate this, Frank.

87
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:49,673
Say hi to the boys for me, too, would you?

88
00:09:57,056 --> 00:09:58,724
Did you get it?

89
00:09:58,808 --> 00:10:00,726
-I got it.
-Okay.

90
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,706
Oh...

91
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:24,792
Hey.

92
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:27,294
Hey.

93
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,506
Couldn't sleep?

94
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:36,929
Every time I close my eyes, I just...

95
00:10:38,848 --> 00:10:41,559
keep seeing that... thing.

96
00:10:42,393 --> 00:10:46,063
Wherever I was, that place...

97
00:10:47,148 --> 00:10:49,733
I think that it lives there.

98
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:51,652
It was feeding there.

99
00:10:52,987 --> 00:10:54,780
Feeding on that deer.

100
00:10:55,865 --> 00:10:58,242
That means that if...

101
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:00,744
if Will and Barbara...

102
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:05,833
Hey.

103
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,586
My mom said she talked to Will.

104
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:12,006
If he's alive,
there's a chance Barbara is, too.

105
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:14,091
That means that she's trapped...

106
00:11:14,717 --> 00:11:16,510
in that place.

107
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:22,266
We have to find it again.

108
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,310
You wanna go back out there?

109
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:26,186
Maybe we don't have to.

110
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:29,565
When I saw it,
it was feeding on that deer.

111
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:32,776
-Meaning it's... it's a predator, right?
-Right.

112
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:36,947
And it seems to hunt at night, like a...
a lion or a coyote.

113
00:11:37,031 --> 00:11:38,741
But it doesn't hunt in packs like them.

114
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:41,994
It's always alone, like...

115
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:44,121
like a bear.

116
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:47,541
And remember at Steve's,
when Barb cut herself?

117
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:51,211
-And then, last night, the deer...
-Hmm, it was bleeding, too.

118
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:52,504
One sec.

119
00:11:53,464 --> 00:11:55,966
Sharks can detect blood
in one part per million.

120
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:58,010
That's one drop of blood in a million,

121
00:11:58,093 --> 00:12:00,346
and they can smell it
from a quarter mile away.

122
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:03,098
So you're saying it can detect blood?

123
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,185
It's just a theory.

124
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:09,188
We could test it.

125
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:13,400
But if it works...

126
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:16,278
At least we'll know it's coming.

127
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:22,076
--Honey, are you up?

128
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:24,662
Yeah, I'm... I'm getting dressed.

129
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:27,289
I, uh, made
some blueberry pancakes.

130
00:12:27,373 --> 00:12:29,041
I'll be down in a second.

131
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:42,596
--Your mom doesn't knock?

132
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:58,112
-Hi. Scott Clarke?
-Uh, yes.

133
00:12:58,195 --> 00:13:00,239
The same Scott Clarke
who teaches science and AV

134
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:01,490
-at Hawkins Middle?
-The very same.

135
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:02,825
Oh, wonderful.

136
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:06,412
...and we're making a newsletter,
which we'll send out monthly.

137
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:08,414
It'll showcase all the latest equipment,

138
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:11,417
as well as how-to articles,
which the kids write themselves.

139
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,918
Oh, that's neat.

140
00:13:13,002 --> 00:13:14,586
What we're really trying to do here,
Mr. Clarke--

141
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,296
Uh, please, call me Scott.

142
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,923
Scott.

143
00:13:18,007 --> 00:13:21,927
What we're trying to do here, Scott,
is to connect kids from all over the state

144
00:13:22,011 --> 00:13:24,013
and give them
the support and encouragement

145
00:13:24,096 --> 00:13:26,098
to pursue careers in technology.

146
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:28,892
We feel these are the kinds of kids
that are going to make Indiana proud.

147
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:31,520
I agree, yes.
Completely.

148
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:34,606
So, you know any kids
you think might wanna participate?

149
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:37,401
Oh, I have a few in mind.

150
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:50,873
I just...
I can't believe she didn't come back.

151
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:52,958
- She's gotta be close.
- She said it wasn't safe.

152
00:13:53,042 --> 00:13:55,586
She just messed up the compasses
because she wanted to protect us.

153
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:57,838
-She didn't betray us.
-Mike, calm down.

154
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:00,174
I shouldn't have yelled at her.
I never should've done that.

155
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:02,843
-Mike, this isn't your fault.
-Yeah, it's Lucas'.

156
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:04,011
It wasn't his fault, either.

157
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:07,222
-It wasn't his fault?
-No.

158
00:14:07,306 --> 00:14:09,016
So you're saying
he wasn't way out of line?

159
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:10,642
-Totally, but so were you!
-What?

160
00:14:10,726 --> 00:14:12,394
-And so was Eleven.
-Oh, give me a break!

161
00:14:12,478 --> 00:14:13,645
No, Mike, you give me a break!

162
00:14:13,729 --> 00:14:16,190
All three of you were being
a bunch of little assholes!

163
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:17,816
I was the only reasonable one.

164
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,569
But the bottom line is...
you pushed first.

165
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:22,529
And you know the rule.
You draw first blood...

166
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:24,365
No! No way!
I'm not shaking his hand.

167
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:25,991
-You're shaking his hand!
-No, I'm not.

168
00:14:26,075 --> 00:14:29,119
This isn't a discussion.
This is the rule of law.

169
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:32,998
Obey or be banished from the party.
Do you wanna be banished?

170
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:34,958
-No.
-Good.

171
00:14:37,378 --> 00:14:38,587
Where are we going?

172
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,964
Where do you think?
We're going to get Lucas.

173
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:42,966
And then we're gonna find Eleven.

174
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:01,652
Today is a very special day.

175
00:15:03,195 --> 00:15:04,446
Do you know why?

176
00:15:07,408 --> 00:15:10,202
Because today, we make history.

177
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:14,289
Today, we make contact.

178
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,968
Here you go.

179
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:10,095
Ah... yum.

180
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:13,515
Okay.
Now, sweetie, swallow the pancake.

181
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:16,643
Where is Nancy?
I thought she was coming down.

182
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:18,937
She is.

183
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:22,065
Uh, she was.
I don't know.

184
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:24,526
- Nancy, what's taking so long?

185
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,236
Nancy?

186
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,989
--Nancy, come on.

187
00:16:41,627 --> 00:16:43,170
Nan--

188
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:10,155
What do you want?

189
00:17:14,743 --> 00:17:17,287
I drew first blood, so...

190
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:34,388
Okay, I'll shake.

191
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:36,306
On one condition.

192
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,433
We forget the weirdo
and go straight to the gate.

193
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:39,935
-Then the deal's off.
-Fine!

194
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:41,728
- Fine!
- No, no, not fine!

195
00:17:41,812 --> 00:17:43,105
Guys, seriously?

196
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:46,441
Do you even remember
what happened on the Bloodstone Pass?

197
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:53,365
We couldn't agree on what path
to take, so we split up the party

198
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:55,367
and those trolls took us out one by one.

199
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,161
And it all went to shit.
And we were all disabled!

200
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:01,123
So we stick together, no matter what!

201
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:06,128
Yeah, I agree. But this is the party,
right here in this room.

202
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:10,132
-El is one of us now.
-Um, no, she's not. Not even close!

203
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:12,467
Never will be.
She's a liar, a traitor--

204
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:14,344
She was just trying to keep us safe!

205
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:15,971
She didn't mean to hurt you.
It was an accident!

206
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:17,264
An accident?

207
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:19,308
All right, accident or not...

208
00:18:19,391 --> 00:18:21,435
-admit it, it was a little awesome.
-Awesome?

209
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:23,437
Yeah, she threw you in the air
with her mind!

210
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,230
I could have been killed!

211
00:18:25,314 --> 00:18:28,108
Which is exactly why we need her.
She's a weapon!

212
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:30,360
Do you seriously wanna fight
the Demogorgon with your wrist rocket?

213
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:32,738
That's like R2-D2
going to fight Darth Vader.

214
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:34,698
We're no use to Will if we're dead.

215
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:38,869
If you two wanna waste your time
looking for a traitor, go ahead,

216
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:42,247
'cause I'm not spending my time
on her anymore. No way!

217
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:46,710
I'm going to the gate.
I'm gonna find Will.

218
00:19:22,454 --> 00:19:23,497
It's okay, Eleven.

219
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,042
Don't be frightened.
These are all friends.

220
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:30,212
They're just here to watch.

221
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:34,091
Don't focus on them.

222
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:36,718
Stay in here, like before.

223
00:19:37,803 --> 00:19:39,388
Yes, Papa.

224
00:19:44,768 --> 00:19:47,854
Now, remember.
Whatever it is, it can't hurt you.

225
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:51,525
Not from here.
So there's nothing to be frightened of.

226
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:54,736
It's reaching out to you...

227
00:19:55,654 --> 00:19:57,656
'cause it wants you.

228
00:19:57,739 --> 00:19:59,366
Hmm?

229
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:00,659
It's calling you...

230
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:03,495
so don't turn away from it this time.

231
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:05,914
I want you to find it.

232
00:20:06,832 --> 00:20:08,083
Understand?

233
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,085
Yes.

234
00:20:44,745 --> 00:20:45,746
Are you lost?

235
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:50,542
Is your mom here?

236
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:54,212
Your dad?

237
00:20:56,631 --> 00:20:58,175
Mouth breather.

238
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:12,314
-What should we do?
-Uh...

239
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:15,776
Call the police.

240
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:22,824
Excuse me. Young lady!
You know you have to pay for those!

241
00:21:22,908 --> 00:21:24,618
- Hey! Stop right--

242
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:26,119
- Please.

243
00:21:26,203 --> 00:21:28,288
You have to pay for those!

244
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:30,874
Stop right there!
Thief! Thief!

245
00:21:57,442 --> 00:21:58,485
Can I help you?

246
00:21:58,568 --> 00:22:00,612
Hi, we're looking for Terry Ives.
Does she live here?

247
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:03,657
-Who's asking?
-The Hawkins chief of police.

248
00:22:07,536 --> 00:22:10,372
And you want to talk to my sister?

249
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:13,291
Well, if your sister's Terry Ives,
then, yeah, we do.

250
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:16,962
Okay, well, you can come in,

251
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:19,172
but if you want Terry
to tell you anything,

252
00:22:19,256 --> 00:22:21,341
you're about five years too late.

253
00:22:23,927 --> 00:22:25,804
Terry, you have some visitors.

254
00:22:26,972 --> 00:22:30,433
Hello.
My name's Joyce Byers.

255
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:33,562
Uh, this is Hopper.
We drove over from Hawkins.

256
00:22:33,645 --> 00:22:37,023
Um, you see, uh, my son...

257
00:22:37,107 --> 00:22:40,360
he's been missing for almost a week now,

258
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:43,613
and, um, we were wondering
if we could talk to you

259
00:22:43,697 --> 00:22:45,323
about your daughter, Jane?

260
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:49,411
If there's anything that you could tell us
about when she was taken...

261
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,205
What was your relationship
with Dr. Brenner?

262
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:54,499
You guys keep in touch?

263
00:22:57,127 --> 00:22:59,212
This is, uh... this is him.

264
00:22:59,296 --> 00:23:01,756
This is Will.

265
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,593
Uh, you may have seen him on...
on the news.

266
00:23:04,676 --> 00:23:06,928
-Uh...
-What's wrong with her?

267
00:23:07,012 --> 00:23:09,723
I told you, you're wasting your time.

268
00:23:46,051 --> 00:23:47,927
This is weird without Lucas.

269
00:23:48,011 --> 00:23:50,889
-He should've shaken my hand.
-He's just jealous.

270
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:52,932
What are you talking about?

271
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:57,562
Sometimes, your total
obliviousness just blows my mind.

272
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:01,441
He's your best friend, right?

273
00:24:01,524 --> 00:24:05,528
-Yeah... I mean, I don't know.
-It's fine. I get it.

274
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:09,115
I didn't get here until the fourth grade.
He had the advantage of living next door.

275
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:10,533
But none of that matters.

276
00:24:10,617 --> 00:24:13,286
What matters
is that he is your best friend.

277
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:15,705
And then this girl shows up
and starts living in your basement,

278
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:17,666
and all you ever want to do
is pay attention to her.

279
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:20,251
-That's not true.
-Yes, it is. And you know it.

280
00:24:20,335 --> 00:24:22,921
And he knows it.
But no one ever says anything

281
00:24:23,004 --> 00:24:25,465
until you both start punching
and yelling at each other

282
00:24:25,548 --> 00:24:28,009
like goblins
with intelligence scores of zero.

283
00:24:28,093 --> 00:24:30,762
-Now everything's weird.
-He's not my best friend.

284
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:34,516
- Yeah, right.
- I mean, he is, but so are you.

285
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:37,018
-And so is Will.
-Can't have more than one best friend.

286
00:24:37,102 --> 00:24:38,812
-Says who?
-Says logic.

287
00:24:38,895 --> 00:24:42,482
Well, I call bull on your logic,
because you're my best friend, too.

288
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:44,526
Okay.

289
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:50,156
Whoa.

290
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,534
--You don't think...

291
00:24:52,617 --> 00:24:55,036
Uh... definitely.

292
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:10,218
Are you ready?

293
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:13,054
She was a part of some study
in college.

294
00:25:13,138 --> 00:25:15,515
-MK Ultra?
-Yeah, that's the one.

295
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:19,352
Was, uh, started in the '50s.

296
00:25:19,436 --> 00:25:20,854
By the time Terry got involved,

297
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:24,149
it was supposed to be ramping down,
but the drugs just got crazier.

298
00:25:24,232 --> 00:25:25,775
Messed her up good.

299
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:28,194
This was the CIA that ran this?

300
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:33,908
You and Terry would've gotten along.
"The Man," with a big capital "M."

301
00:25:33,992 --> 00:25:35,452
They'd pay... you know,

302
00:25:35,535 --> 00:25:38,496
a couple hundred bucks
to people like my sister,

303
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:42,250
give 'em drugs, psychedelics.
LSD, mostly.

304
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:46,129
And then they'd strip her naked
and put her in these isolation tanks.

305
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:48,047
- Isolation tanks?
- Yeah.

306
00:25:48,131 --> 00:25:50,175
These big bathtubs, basically,

307
00:25:50,258 --> 00:25:52,886
filled with salt water,
so you can float around in there.

308
00:25:52,969 --> 00:25:55,638
You lose any sense of, uh...

309
00:25:55,722 --> 00:25:59,517
sense and feel nothing, see nothing.

310
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:02,896
They wanted to expand
the boundaries of the mind.

311
00:26:02,979 --> 00:26:04,355
Real hippie crap.

312
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:07,025
I... I mean, it's not like they were
forcing her to do any of this stuff.

313
00:26:07,108 --> 00:26:08,359
The thing is, though, is that

314
00:26:08,443 --> 00:26:10,528
she didn't know
she was pregnant at the time.

315
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:12,113
Jane.

316
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,994
Do you have any pictures of her?

317
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:23,082
I don't think you guys understand.

318
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,377
Terry miscarried in the third trimester.

319
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:34,594
She keeps all of this up.
Been doing it for 12 years.

320
00:26:36,721 --> 00:26:40,683
Terry, uh, pretends like Jane is real,

321
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:43,561
- like she's gonna come home someday.

322
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:48,107
Says she's special.
Born with "abilities."

323
00:26:49,442 --> 00:26:50,985
Abilities?

324
00:26:53,947 --> 00:26:55,657
You read any Stephen King?

325
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:03,289
You guys look scared, actually.

326
00:27:03,373 --> 00:27:06,209
I mean, it's all make-believe.

327
00:27:07,085 --> 00:27:09,128
What... what kind of abilities?

328
00:27:09,212 --> 00:27:11,923
Telepathy, telekinesis...

329
00:27:13,716 --> 00:27:15,802
You know, shit you can do with your mind.

330
00:27:16,761 --> 00:27:19,848
That's why the big, bad Man
stole Jane away.

331
00:27:19,931 --> 00:27:21,391
Papa!

332
00:27:21,474 --> 00:27:24,477
Her baby's a weapon,
off fighting the commies.

333
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:28,731
You know, the doctors all say
it's a coping mechanism.

334
00:27:28,815 --> 00:27:30,525
You know, to deal with the guilt.

335
00:27:30,608 --> 00:27:33,570
Do you think there is any chance
she could be telling the truth?

336
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:36,948
About having had the kid.

337
00:27:37,031 --> 00:27:39,826
There is no birth certificate,
nothing from the hospital.

338
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:42,996
Doctors and nurses
all confirm that she miscarried.

339
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:46,249
Yeah, but that could've been covered up.
Right?

340
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:50,253
Like I said, you and Terry
would've gotten along.

341
00:28:12,275 --> 00:28:14,360
Oh, man.

342
00:29:04,035 --> 00:29:07,121
And I'll have four boxes of the .38s.

343
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:17,006
What you kids doin' with all this?

344
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,424
Um...

345
00:29:21,344 --> 00:29:24,305
- Monster hunting.
- Huh.

346
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:28,685
"Monster hunting"?

347
00:29:31,562 --> 00:29:33,064
You know, last week...

348
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:36,985
I was shopping for a new top
I thought Steve might like.

349
00:29:37,068 --> 00:29:38,903
It took me and Barb all weekend.

350
00:29:38,987 --> 00:29:42,865
It seemed like life or death, you know?
And... and now--

351
00:29:42,949 --> 00:29:45,493
You're shopping for bear traps
with Jonathan Byers.

352
00:29:46,411 --> 00:29:47,537
Yeah.

353
00:29:48,746 --> 00:29:50,039
What's the weirdest part?

354
00:29:50,957 --> 00:29:52,375
Me or the bear trap?

355
00:29:53,293 --> 00:29:55,628
You.
It's definitely you.

356
00:29:57,213 --> 00:29:58,965
--Hey, Nance!

357
00:29:59,841 --> 00:30:02,552
Can't wait to see your movie.

358
00:30:02,635 --> 00:30:04,012
What the hell was that?

359
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:06,806
I don't know.

360
00:30:10,435 --> 00:30:11,561
What?

361
00:30:14,147 --> 00:30:15,773
What?

362
00:30:15,857 --> 00:30:17,442
Hey! Where are you going?

363
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:21,779
--Nancy, wait!

364
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:26,659
Nancy!

365
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:36,210
- I can't believe it.
- These kids!

366
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:38,629
- Jesus.

367
00:30:41,716 --> 00:30:43,051
Wow.

368
00:30:48,306 --> 00:30:49,349
Wait!

369
00:30:49,432 --> 00:30:51,017
Tommy,
you write like a three-year-old.

370
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,061
- Shut up!
- I didn't know you could spell.

371
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:02,111
Aw, hey there, princess!

372
00:31:02,904 --> 00:31:04,781
Uh-oh! She looks upset.

373
00:31:07,241 --> 00:31:08,326
- Oh!
- Damn!

374
00:31:08,409 --> 00:31:09,744
What is wrong with you?

375
00:31:09,827 --> 00:31:11,120
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with you?

376
00:31:11,204 --> 00:31:12,747
I was worried about you.

377
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,916
I can't believe that I was
actually worried about you.

378
00:31:14,999 --> 00:31:18,252
-What are you talking about?
-I wouldn't lie if I were you.

379
00:31:18,336 --> 00:31:21,506
You don't want to be known
as the lying slut now, do you?

380
00:31:21,589 --> 00:31:22,799
Speak of the devil.

381
00:31:24,092 --> 00:31:25,134
Hi.

382
00:31:26,803 --> 00:31:27,970
You came by last night?

383
00:31:28,471 --> 00:31:31,557
Ding! Ding! Ding!
Does she get a prize?

384
00:31:31,641 --> 00:31:34,394
Look, I don't know what you think you saw,
but it wasn't like that.

385
00:31:34,477 --> 00:31:37,855
What, you just let him into your room
to... study?

386
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:40,525
Or for another
pervy photo session?

387
00:31:40,608 --> 00:31:42,151
- We were just--
- You were just what?

388
00:31:42,235 --> 00:31:43,820
Finish that sentence.

389
00:31:45,947 --> 00:31:48,783
Finish the sentence.

390
00:31:55,373 --> 00:31:57,291
Go to hell, Nancy.

391
00:31:58,042 --> 00:31:59,502
Come on, Nancy, let's just leave.

392
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:01,129
You know what, Byers?
I'm actually kind of impressed.

393
00:32:01,212 --> 00:32:02,755
I always took you for a queer,
but I guess you're just

394
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:04,841
a little screw-up like your father.

395
00:32:04,924 --> 00:32:07,593
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, that house is full of screw-ups.

396
00:32:07,677 --> 00:32:09,178
You know, I guess I shouldn't
really be surprised.

397
00:32:09,262 --> 00:32:10,471
A bunch of screw-ups in your family.

398
00:32:10,555 --> 00:32:11,722
-Jonathan, leave it.
-I mean, your mom...

399
00:32:11,806 --> 00:32:13,641
I'm not even surprised
what happened to your brother.

400
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:14,767
Steve, shut up!

401
00:32:14,851 --> 00:32:15,852
I'm sorry I have to be
the one to tell you,

402
00:32:15,935 --> 00:32:17,728
but the Byers, their family,
it's a disgrace to the entire--

403
00:32:21,691 --> 00:32:23,276
--Steve!

404
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:25,027
- Oh!

405
00:32:25,111 --> 00:32:26,696
- Steve.

406
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:29,532
Stop! Steve!
Knock it off, you guys!

407
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:31,701
- Get off of him, seriously!
- Kick his ass, man!

408
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:33,161
- Get off! Stop!

409
00:32:34,912 --> 00:32:36,497
-Get in there, he's going to hurt himself!
-Easy, easy!

410
00:32:36,581 --> 00:32:39,333
Hey. Hey! Get out of here!
Get out of here! Get out of here!

411
00:32:43,296 --> 00:32:45,756
Jonathan, stop!
Stop! You're going to hurt him!

412
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,800
- Jonathan, stop!

413
00:32:47,884 --> 00:32:50,011
- Cops!
- Guys-- Jonathan, get off of him!

414
00:32:50,094 --> 00:32:52,263
- Stop it!
- Cops! Come on!

415
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:54,265
-Stop it! Come on!
-Cops!

416
00:32:54,348 --> 00:32:56,517
-You have to stop!
-Just go, Carol!

417
00:32:56,601 --> 00:32:58,060
- Stop it!

418
00:32:58,144 --> 00:32:59,770
Hey, he's had enough, man!
I said he's had enough!

419
00:32:59,854 --> 00:33:01,606
-Kids! All right!
-Stop it!

420
00:33:03,107 --> 00:33:04,692
Oh! My nose!

421
00:33:04,775 --> 00:33:06,569
Calm him down!

422
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:09,238
--Go, go, go, go, go, go!

423
00:33:09,322 --> 00:33:13,201
Hey! Hey, uh-uh. Uh-uh.
Come here, little guys! Come here!

424
00:33:13,284 --> 00:33:14,869
- Get off!
- I got this one!

425
00:33:14,952 --> 00:33:17,872
Get back here!
Get back here, you little punks!

426
00:33:24,504 --> 00:33:26,923
Good gift for a college student...

427
00:33:33,304 --> 00:33:35,056
Well, thank you for your time.
We appreciate it.

428
00:33:35,139 --> 00:33:37,266
Hmm, yeah,
I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help.

429
00:33:40,144 --> 00:33:42,480
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

430
00:33:50,196 --> 00:33:51,280
Hey...

431
00:33:52,365 --> 00:33:53,908
What?

432
00:33:54,575 --> 00:33:56,035
We're gonna find him.

433
00:33:58,162 --> 00:34:01,249
Yeah, like Terry found her daughter?

434
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:04,126
We're close.

435
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:09,215
Twelve years?
Twelve years she's been looking for her--

436
00:34:09,298 --> 00:34:10,967
And then she shows up
at Benny's five nights ago,

437
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,260
which means we've got a chance.

438
00:34:12,343 --> 00:34:14,053
You know what I would give?

439
00:34:15,096 --> 00:34:17,348
For a chance?

440
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:19,141
You know what I would give?

441
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:21,561
Hey, Chief, you there?

442
00:34:21,686 --> 00:34:23,854
-Hey, Chief?
-Yeah, go ahead.

443
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,731
Yeah, a fight broke out here and--

444
00:34:25,815 --> 00:34:29,026
-Cal, I don't have time for this.
-It's Jonathan Byers.

445
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:31,153
You haven't seen Joyce, have you?

446
00:34:43,666 --> 00:34:45,960
Do you think we'll be out of here soon?

447
00:34:46,043 --> 00:34:48,170
You, yes. Him, no.

448
00:34:48,254 --> 00:34:50,506
He assaulted a police officer.

449
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:52,842
--Well, how long are you gonna keep him?

450
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:55,094
You and your boyfriend
have big plans, do you?

451
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:57,388
He's not my boyfriend.

452
00:34:57,471 --> 00:34:59,974
I think you better tell him that.

453
00:35:00,683 --> 00:35:01,726
What?

454
00:35:01,809 --> 00:35:04,562
Only love makes you that crazy,
sweetheart.

455
00:35:05,605 --> 00:35:07,481
And that damn stupid.

456
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:17,325
Found some ice.

457
00:35:19,702 --> 00:35:20,870
Thanks.

458
00:35:34,634 --> 00:35:35,968
Everything okay?

459
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,846
Yeah.

460
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:41,557
Everything's fine.

461
00:35:54,654 --> 00:35:56,489
El!

462
00:35:58,658 --> 00:36:00,409
Eleven!

463
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:05,748
-Eleven! El!
-El!

464
00:36:07,041 --> 00:36:08,626
Eleven!

465
00:36:08,709 --> 00:36:09,919
Eleven!

466
00:36:12,922 --> 00:36:15,800
-Hey, stop. Do you hear that?
-What?

467
00:36:15,883 --> 00:36:16,967
El!

468
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:19,011
El?

469
00:36:23,516 --> 00:36:24,809
Hey, there, Frogface.

470
00:36:25,726 --> 00:36:26,769
Toothless.

471
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:28,729
Shit! Run, Mike!

472
00:36:28,813 --> 00:36:30,856
-What?
-Run! Come on!

473
00:36:31,691 --> 00:36:33,109
You're dead, Wheeler.

474
00:36:33,192 --> 00:36:34,902
Move, Mike!

475
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:36,570
Mike, come on, run!

476
00:37:53,773 --> 00:37:55,733
Cramp!

477
00:37:55,816 --> 00:37:57,485
- Just keep going!

478
00:37:57,568 --> 00:37:58,736
Keep going!

479
00:38:04,867 --> 00:38:06,327
Shit!

480
00:38:08,037 --> 00:38:10,206
-Stay back!
-Don't come any closer!

481
00:38:12,792 --> 00:38:15,419
--Nice throw, numbnuts.

482
00:38:18,756 --> 00:38:20,424
--Get off! Get off me!

483
00:38:20,508 --> 00:38:22,384
Let him go! Let him go!

484
00:38:22,468 --> 00:38:25,429
-Stay back, or I cut him!
-What do you want?

485
00:38:25,513 --> 00:38:26,722
I want to know how you did it!

486
00:38:26,806 --> 00:38:28,098
- How I did what?

487
00:38:28,182 --> 00:38:29,475
I know you did something to me.

488
00:38:29,558 --> 00:38:31,435
Some nerdy science shit
to make me do that.

489
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,770
You mean piss your pants?

490
00:38:33,854 --> 00:38:35,439
Our friend has superpowers,

491
00:38:35,523 --> 00:38:37,942
and she squeezed your tiny bladder
with her mind.

492
00:38:38,025 --> 00:38:39,401
- Shut up!

493
00:38:39,485 --> 00:38:41,821
I think I should save Toothless here
a trip to the dentist.

494
00:38:41,904 --> 00:38:43,614
Help him lose the rest of his baby teeth.

495
00:38:43,697 --> 00:38:45,533
Let him go.
Let him go!

496
00:38:45,616 --> 00:38:47,827
I'll let him go, sure.

497
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:50,204
- But first... it's your turn.

498
00:38:50,287 --> 00:38:51,413
My turn for what?

499
00:38:51,497 --> 00:38:53,123
Wet yourself.

500
00:38:53,958 --> 00:38:55,960
-What?
-Jump...

501
00:38:56,043 --> 00:38:58,504
or Toothless here
gets an early trip to the dentist.

502
00:38:58,587 --> 00:38:59,922
Stop! No!

503
00:39:04,552 --> 00:39:05,719
I'll cut him right now!

504
00:39:08,222 --> 00:39:10,683
All right, just hold on!
Hold on!

505
00:39:10,766 --> 00:39:13,102
Mike, don't do it.
I don't need my baby teeth, Mike!

506
00:39:13,185 --> 00:39:15,062
Mike, seriously, don't!

507
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:34,832
Mike, don't do it!

508
00:39:34,915 --> 00:39:37,751
Seriously, don't do it, man!
Seriously, don't!

509
00:39:37,835 --> 00:39:39,712
Troy, I don't think
this is a good idea, man.

510
00:39:40,588 --> 00:39:42,172
Mike, don't!

511
00:39:42,256 --> 00:39:45,885
- Dentist's office opens in five...

512
00:39:45,968 --> 00:39:48,387
Four! Three!

513
00:39:50,139 --> 00:39:52,266
-Two!
-Mike!

514
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:53,350
One!

515
00:40:02,902 --> 00:40:04,111
Holy shit.

516
00:40:14,163 --> 00:40:17,082
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

517
00:40:45,486 --> 00:40:47,863
She broke my arm! My arm!

518
00:40:47,947 --> 00:40:48,989
Go.

519
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:52,910
- Let's get out of here! Let's go!
- Go!

520
00:40:52,993 --> 00:40:54,912
Yeah, that's right!
You better run!

521
00:40:55,663 --> 00:40:58,123
She's our friend and she's crazy!

522
00:40:58,207 --> 00:41:00,584
You come back here and she'll kill you!

523
00:41:00,668 --> 00:41:04,630
You hear me?
She'll kill you, you sons of bitches!

524
00:41:04,713 --> 00:41:06,757
She'll kill you, you hear me?

525
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:24,168
El, are you okay?

526
00:42:24,251 --> 00:42:25,836
El?

527
00:42:26,879 --> 00:42:29,673
Mike... I'm sorry.

528
00:42:29,757 --> 00:42:32,217
Sorry? What are you sorry for?

529
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:34,678
The gate...

530
00:42:38,557 --> 00:42:39,975
I opened it.

531
00:42:43,645 --> 00:42:45,064
I'm the monster.

532
00:42:46,482 --> 00:42:49,151
No. No, El, you're not the monster.

533
00:42:49,234 --> 00:42:50,819
You saved me.

534
00:42:50,903 --> 00:42:53,781
Do you understand?
You saved me.

535
00:43:33,654 --> 00:43:37,324
I have eyes on 'em now.
They're heading home.
