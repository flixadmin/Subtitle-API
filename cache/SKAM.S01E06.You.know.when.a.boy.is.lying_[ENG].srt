1
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:08,340
He's the hottest guy in all of third-year.
I think we're going to sleep together.

2
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,500
I like it.
I think it's kinda hot.

3
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,940
Hey, don't be such a dick tease!

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:18,340
- Ingrid... I miss you.
- You look like a slut.

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,060
I'm not talking to Ingrid behind your back!

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,500
- Where the hell are you?
- Sorry, but I can't come tonight.

7
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,900
- Who was that?
- That was my sister.

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,620
- Jonas!
- I'm sorry, but I really have to go now. Sorry.

9
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,300
SHAME

10
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,610
SUNDAY, 2:42 P.M.

11
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,740
- Hey!
- Hi.

12
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,860
- Sad?
- No!

13
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,740
- I bought you a coffee.
- Thanks!

14
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,850
What are we talking about?

15
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,980
Nothing.
I just thought it'd be nice with coffee.

16
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,080
What did you do on the weekend?

17
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,150
Nothing.

18
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,200
What did you do on Friday?

19
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:21,900
- Mom had her birthday.
- So you just stayed home?

20
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:27,980
- Yes! Did something happen last Friday?
- No, I was just wondering what you did.

21
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,720
I think that maybe...

22
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,840
- Jonas was with Ingrid.
- Oh.

23
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:48,060
- Do you know anything about it?
- No. Why do you think he was?

24
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:52,060
I was talking to him on the phone,
and heard her voice in the background.

25
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:56,100
- Did you tell him?
- Yeah, but he said it's his sister.

26
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:00,260
- Maybe it was.
- Hey! I think I know Ingrid's voice.

27
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,100
- We were best friends for four years.
- Yeah.

28
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:09,060
But... tell him that, then? Push him a bit.

29
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:14,180
I have told him, but he got really pissed
and said I have to trust him.

30
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,520
Eva...

31
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,100
why are you together with him?

32
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,010
What do you mean?

33
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,870
Jonas is my bro, but...

34
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,520
I don't get why
you're together with someone...

35
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,700
you don't trust.

36
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,220
So...

37
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,260
you think I should trust him, then?

38
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,260
Or, you could go for option three.

39
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,920
You could ask Ingrid.

40
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,700
MONDAY, 2:15 P.M.

41
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,320
I'm going to see William soon again, and...

42
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:09,480
I think we have something going on,
it's just that... there's a big age difference.

43
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,540
I really think there could be
something between us.

44
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:20,980
He said he thinks I'm really special.
And I'm ready for it, even though...

45
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,260
Did I tell you I got an orgasm?

46
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,670
Smile then

47
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,100
Okay. What was it like?

48
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,680
You smile

49
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:32,370
It was a bit like a sneeze. Just down there.

50
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,200
- Like sneezing?
- Mhm.

51
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,400
I am smiling

52
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:43,100
And... I think I know
why everyone got an orgasm with him.

53
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:43,240
You're pissed

54
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:46,740
- Yeah, why is that?
- Because he was really big.

55
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:51,120
You can't go around talking about his dick size.

56
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,820
Why not?

57
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,000
Hello!?!!

58
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,460
You're asking me why you can't go around telling
people about his most vulnerable body part?

59
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:02,450
First of all,
that body part wasn't exactly vulnerable.

60
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:07,590
And secondly, I'm pretty sure
he'll talk about my body with his friends.

61
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:05,290
hello

62
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:14,140
Since guys do it, I think girls can do it too.
Sorry for being for equality and feminism.

63
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:18,540
But Vilde, first of all,
size doesn't have anything to do with orgasm.

64
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:25,120
And secondly, just because guys are idiots,
it doesn't mean we have to be as well.

65
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,540
It's got nothing to do with equality at all.

66
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:28,650
Okay, text me
when you're not pissed

67
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,520
Whatever...

68
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:35,660
But, it was good, then?
That's the important part.

69
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,160
It was really good.

70
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,500
But...

71
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,660
there's just one thing.

72
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:46,660
No one tells you that...
it actually runs out of you again.

73
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,570
Didn't you use a condom?

74
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,580
- No, he said he tends not to use one.
- Vilde...

75
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,260
What the hell is that?

76
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,260
- Where did you get those?
- Sana knows someone.

77
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,340
Someone will pick up the toilet paper tonight.

78
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,580
- But I need payment first.
- That's not how it works.

79
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,060
He needs the toilet paper
to get paid by his people,

80
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,280
and then he pays you,
so you can pay your people.

81
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,860
But I don't have "people".

82
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:38,910
Do you think MasterCard
operates without people?

83
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,460
Hey.

84
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,860
- Hi!
- Hey.

85
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,420
You coming to the Halloween party on Friday?

86
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,040
- Yeah, maybe.
- We're coming!

87
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,140
Good. Talk to you later.

88
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,630
Bye!

89
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,770
TUESDAY, 3:30 P.M.

90
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,100
You smell like smoke.

91
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,100
What's up, Eva?

92
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,300
I can't take this...

93
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:45,580
I think there's something
between you and Ingrid.

94
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,820
Really?

95
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,260
That's still what you're thinking?

96
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,780
What do you want me to think?
I know I heard her voice on the phone!

97
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,420
For the last time,
it was my sister in the background!

98
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:59,440
- What did your sister want with me?
- Because she thought it was my mom!

99
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:02,210
Wasn't your mom at home?

100
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,530
Jonas!

101
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:07,200
You said you couldn't come to me, because you
had to help your mom with something at home.

102
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:13,620
- But your mom wasn't even home?
- No, she came home later. That's why she called.

103
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:19,660
- You're lying! Why are you lying to me?
- I'm not lying!

104
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,700
I can't do this.

105
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,100
Can't do this?

106
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,860
What do you mean you can't do this?

107
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,660
Do you want to take a break or something?

108
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:46,260
- That's what you want.
- No, that's not what I want!

109
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:50,740
Stop being so insecure all the time!

110
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:59,380
What's up with you? Can't you just listen to me?

111
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:14,840
WEDNESDAY, 2:30 P.M.

112
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:20,140
...I got a glass of water and...
he's the kind of guy who sees others--

113
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,080
What about alcohol
for the Halloween party?

114
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:24,680
I texted William and asked
if he could get us some.

115
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,280
Could he?

116
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:31,060
He didn't reply yet, he's really, really busy.
He's in the third year, and he's the bus boss.

117
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,780
He has so much to think about,
I'd be really stressed if I were him.

118
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,190
So we haven't really talked since last.

119
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:40,620
But... we do keep in touch through Snapchat.

120
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,530
You know what I did yesterday?

121
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,820
No.

122
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,980
I sent William a topless picture.

123
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,550
- You did what?
- They're just boobs.

124
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,740
William likes confident girls.

125
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:56,170
What did he reply?

126
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:00,130
He didn't reply directly,
but he took a screenshot.

127
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,650
Listen up... Einstein.

128
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,830
William isn't interested.

129
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:09,460
- He could very well be.
- He didn't even reply to a topless picture.

130
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:12,480
There's a book called "The Game",

131
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:16,350
it says that "not replying is a strategy guys use
to get girls interested".

132
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:21,230
If I were you, I would put down "The Game",
and start reading "He's Just Not That Into You".

133
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,570
Why are you always so mean?

134
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,180
Hello?!

135
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:43,530
We are her friends. If not even we
can tell her the truth, who will?

136
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:49,690
She's sending topless pictures to a guy who is
lying about liking her, just to sleep with her.

137
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:52,890
- That's what's mean!
- You don't know if he's lying!

138
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:57,070
But you agree he doesn't seem like
the most trustworthy guy?

139
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,670
I mean, you can't just claim
that people are lying, without having proof.

140
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,530
- Sometimes you have to trust people.
- You know when guys are lying.

141
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:10,750
- And how do you "know" that?
- Their stories are inconsistent.

142
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,930
When you ask too many questions, they get mad.
Afterwards, they get a bad conscience...

143
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,380
and start drowning you in compliments.

144
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:20,660
Believe me,
just wait and see.

145
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,840
William will break her heart.

146
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,280
FRIDAY, 8:30 P.M.

147
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:29,490
You know you're
the coolest, best, hottest,
funniest, prettiest girl
in the whole world, right?
I love you <3 <3 <3

148
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,740
- Were you with Jonas last Friday?
- Hi, Eva!

149
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,260
Just answer me.

150
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,740
Last Friday?

151
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:00,300
Yes! Yes, I was with Jonas.

152
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,220
Oh. Didn't he tell you?

153
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,380
- Oops...
- Fuck you!

154
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,900
No, fuck you Eva. Fuck you!

155
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,320
I talked to Ingrid

156
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,080
I talked to Ingrid
and she told me

157
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:35,530
I talked to Ingrid
and she told me EVERYTHING!

158
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:36,930
I talked to Ingrid
and she told me EVERYTHING!

159
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,540
You're sitting here?

160
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,700
I'm sitting here.

161
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,740
- Look's like someone is trying to reach you.
- Yeah.

162
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:30,220
- Who is Jonas?
- My boyfriend. Or, well...

163
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:37,860
- You don't know if he's your boyfriend, or?
- He is my boyfriend, it's just that...

164
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,540
We had a fight, so...

165
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,220
Hey, you...

166
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,580
Fuck him.

167
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:59,260
If he can make such a nice girl cry, fuck him.

168
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,420
I can't do this.

169
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,660
There you are.

170
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,570
What are you guys doing?

171
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:43,400
I was comforting Eva,
who had a fight with her guy.

172
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,420
Have you met Eva?

173
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,460
Eva, this is Iben.

174
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:51,450
My girlfriend.

175
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:59,020
I don't know why I'm the one talking to you,
Iben's really good with boyfriend troubles.

176
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:01,290
She had a fight with her boyfriend,
and is a bit down.

177
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,050
Oh, poor you.

178
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,420
I'll give you two some time.

179
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,980
I'm fine, really. You don't need to--

180
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,980
Believe me, I know what it's like.

181
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:23,980
You're a first-year, right? That's when everyone
tries to figure out who they are.

182
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,700
And that leads to people changing a lot.

183
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:31,700
People you thought you knew,
might not be the way you thought they were.

184
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,780
The same goes for boyfriends.

185
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,940
I had a boyfriend in the first year,
who was a complete douchebag.

186
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:42,220
He cheated on me like five times
without me knowing about it.

187
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,420
Oh.

188
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,000
But...

189
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,950
it gets better as you get older.

190
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:53,990
Like with me and Christoffer, it's going really
well, because third-year guys are more mature.

191
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:58,500
We can talk about everything,
and I trust him 110%.

192
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:03,180
You'll get like a more adult relationship,
if you know what I mean.

193
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,300
Are you also in the third year?

194
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:12,980
No, second. But there's so much that happens
between your first and second year.

195
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:17,180
My advice is to
not take relationships so seriously.

196
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:22,220
Think of it as something temporary.
Don't let him stand in your way.

197
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,220
Hey, it's Halloween!
There's a really cool party here.

198
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:29,180
And you're sitting here,
like a sad ballerina.

199
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,900
You agree, right?

200
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:37,360
Come on,
let's go out there and have a great time!

201
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,780
Thanks, you're really kind, but...

202
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:46,310
But I don't feel too good,
so, I think I'll just go home.

203
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,940
Are you sure?

204
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,060
Really sure?

205
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,100
It'll get better.

206
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:35,640
FRIDAY, 9:42 P.M.

207
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,700
Black Swan?

208
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,020
I can't handle us breaking up.

209
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:56,500
The thing is that Ingrid's brother is dealing.

210
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,150
Dealing what?

211
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,760
Weed.

212
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,790
Have you started smoking marijuana?

213
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,660
Why?

214
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:15,780
There's a reason I didn't tell you.
You're reacting as if it was heroin.

215
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,920
Marijuana is a drug.

216
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,880
- So you think it's as dangerous as heroin?
- Yes!

217
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:31,810
That's why I was at Ingrid's brother's
last Friday. To buy some.

218
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:37,260
And then Ingrid showed up. But she lives there,
so I couldn't say anything to you.

219
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:45,940
- Why didn't you say anything to me?
- Really? Did you see your reaction just now?

220
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,550
Anyway.

221
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:57,530
My point is that there's nothing
between me and Ingrid.

222
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:02,740
And there never will be anything, either.

223
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,650
And I... it was really dumb of me to lie.

224
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:10,040
But that you thought there was...

225
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:13,940
That really hurt me. It hurts.

226
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:18,580
Because, I trust you 100%.

227
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,660
You have to start trusting me.

228
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:31,700
Because I would never do anything...

229
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,000
I would never do anything to ruin things for us.

230
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,780
Because it is the two of us.

231
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:47,870
Right?

232
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,630
Don't cry.
