Nothing good about it.

27
00:03:34,782 --> 00:03:35,616
Get up!

28
00:03:41,723 --> 00:03:43,390
Let's go, get up.

29
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:46,794
Let's go boys.
Let's get this show on the road.

30
00:03:46,828 --> 00:03:47,995
Come on! Come on!

31
00:03:48,029 --> 00:03:49,630
Come on, get out of bed.

32
00:03:49,664 --> 00:03:50,565
Let's go, get up.

33
00:03:51,866 --> 00:03:53,467
Clean this fucking mess up.

34
00:03:54,736 --> 00:03:55,903
Hey, Jackie, I need a hand.

35
00:03:57,672 --> 00:03:59,306
Put some clothes on.

36
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:00,775
Diaz, what the fuck?

37
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:11,919
You got a joke for me today?

38
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,654
Move!

39
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:18,492
All right, come on,
let's go, guys.

40
00:04:18,526 --> 00:04:20,762
Move your fucking ass. Move.

41
00:04:23,965 --> 00:04:25,633
Don't test me, Walters.

42
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,034
Come on, boys.

43
00:04:27,802 --> 00:04:29,369
Get him on the ground.

44
00:04:29,871 --> 00:04:31,506
Move your fucking ass, Bullock.

45
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:32,573
Fuck you!

46
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:34,942
Get the fuck out my cell.

47
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:38,713
Leave me alone.

48
00:04:39,013 --> 00:04:40,848
Hey, Arthur, you feelin'
crazy today or what?

49
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:43,684
I don't wanna come out today.

50
00:04:43,718 --> 00:04:44,919
Take him down to F Ward.

51
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:46,687
I don't wanna come out today.

52
00:04:46,721 --> 00:04:49,422
You got a big day today.
You better put on a happy face.

53
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:50,725
Get the fuck off me.

54
00:05:09,844 --> 00:05:11,813
Let's not do this again, Beanie.

55
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:17,785
Shut up!

56
00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:26,561
Let's go, Arthur.

57
00:05:26,594 --> 00:05:28,029
Come on, Fleck.

58
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:30,631
Don't need your fancy lawyer
blaming me if you're late.

59
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:33,034
She knows how much you like me,
right?

60
00:05:34,936 --> 00:05:36,704
Hey, Fleck,
you got a joke for us today?

61
00:05:38,673 --> 00:05:40,440
Yeah,
it's been a while, hasn't it?

62
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:10,805
Move.

63
00:06:24,886 --> 00:06:25,853
Right on the line.

64
00:06:26,921 --> 00:06:28,488
Let's go!

65
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:30,057
Back the fuck up, Ken.

66
00:06:30,091 --> 00:06:32,026
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Go on, front of the line.

67
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:35,863
Fleck. Fleck's next, my dear.

68
00:06:35,897 --> 00:06:38,766
Hey, stay in line.

69
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:39,734
Yeah, you heard him.

70
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:43,905
Hey, hey, hey, back up.

71
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:47,742
Freak bit me!

72
00:06:52,146 --> 00:06:52,980
Go.

73
00:07:01,122 --> 00:07:03,591
All that kid's done
since he got here
is fucking smile.

74
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:06,093
And today, all of a sudden,
he bites Moran?

75
00:07:06,127 --> 00:07:08,029
It's because nobody likes Moran.

76
00:07:08,062 --> 00:07:09,997
He was at Gotham State
for, like, eight years

77
00:07:10,031 --> 00:07:12,533
before he got here,
and he's still a fucking temp.

78
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,677
Hey, Fleck,
you got a joke for us today?

79
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,578
I already asked him.

80
00:07:24,612 --> 00:07:25,813
I got a joke for ya.

81
00:07:28,049 --> 00:07:31,886
This guy's dog dies, right?
And he really loved this dog.

82
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,124
So, he goes down to the church,
and he asks Father Mulcahy

83
00:07:37,158 --> 00:07:39,827
if he'd perform
a funeral for him. Right?

84
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:43,564
And Mulcahy says, "Oh, no.
I'm sorry my son,

85
00:07:43,597 --> 00:07:46,801
we can't have a service
for an animal in our church.

86
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:48,669
Uh, but, I bet if you go down

87
00:07:48,703 --> 00:07:50,871
-to the veterinarian in town..."
-Fuck.

88
00:07:50,905 --> 00:07:52,239
"...he can do it
for you. You see?"

89
00:07:52,273 --> 00:07:54,041
Goddamn it, Arthur.

90
00:07:54,075 --> 00:07:56,577
Uh, so the guy says,
"Oh, thanks very much, Father."

91
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,246
And he says,
"Do you think two grand

92
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,182
would be enough
to cover the service?"

93
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,618
Father Mulcahy looks at him...

94
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:08,589
"Why didn't you tell me
the dog was Catholic?"

95
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,562
Eh?

96
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:15,563
Clean yourself up.

97
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:16,764
You like that one, Arthur?

98
00:08:17,832 --> 00:08:20,868
Let's go.

99
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:22,837
"Why didn't you tell me
the dog was a Catholic?"

100
00:09:20,094 --> 00:09:21,695
Look around, Arthur.

101
00:09:21,729 --> 00:09:23,697
This is how
the other half lives.

102
00:09:23,998 --> 00:09:25,132
Could have been all yours

103
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,100
if you hadn't killed
five people.

104
00:09:27,368 --> 00:09:29,070

Come on. You fucking lunatic.

Jesus Christ, you couldn't
get him a fucking umbrella?

113
00:10:15,216 --> 00:10:17,284
Aw, come on, counselor,

114
00:10:17,318 --> 00:10:19,153
you know we can't
give these boys umbrellas.

115

It's for their own good.

116
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:22,756
Oh, don't give me your shit.
He's soaking wet.

counselor,

118
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:26,994
but I'll break them
if you ask me.

119
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:28,195

120
00:10:28,229 --> 00:10:29,864
Mm-hm.

121
00:10:29,897 --> 00:10:31,398
Oh, you're welcome, by the way,

122
00:10:31,432 --> 00:10:32,900
for getting him
all cleaned up for you.

123
00:10:35,069 --> 00:10:36,036
Sit down.

124
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:39,140
Here, Arthur.

125
00:10:43,811 --> 00:10:45,779
Today,
we're meeting with Dr. Beatty.

126
00:10:45,813 --> 00:10:46,847
Remember her?

127
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:50,017
She's gonna be
videotaping you this time,

128
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:53,220
so we can show it at your
competency hearing next week.

129
00:10:53,254 --> 00:10:55,856
And if they find you competent,

130
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,892
and they will, they always do,

131
00:10:57,925 --> 00:10:59,793
then we're going to trial.

132
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:06,033
You need to be in an actual
hospital with actual doctors.

133
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:09,403
Not this
Department of Corrections...

134
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:11,672
bullshit with these thugs.

135
00:11:13,941 --> 00:11:16,477
Dr. Beatty thinks
that with everything

136
00:11:16,511 --> 00:11:18,946
that happened to you
in your childhood,

137
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:21,048
it caused a split...

138
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:26,120
this fragmentation in you...

139
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:28,022
...to help you cope
with your pain.

140
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:33,427
She believes you have another
person living inside of you.

141
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:38,365
And it was this other person
who committed those crimes.

142
00:11:40,434 --> 00:11:42,870
Do you understand
what that means, Arthur?

143
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:49,210
<i>I'll be asking you</i>
<i>a few questions today, Arthur,</i>
<i>okay?</i>

144
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:56,150
<i>Maybe you don't remember</i>
<i>some things?</i>

145
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:58,953
<i>Or you're confused</i>
<i>about what you did?</i>

146
00:11:59,521 --> 00:12:01,922
<i>I'm here to help you</i>
<i>try and sort out what happened.</i>

147
00:12:10,231 --> 00:12:14,201
Arthur, I'm not here
only to help with your defense.

148
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:17,004
I'm here for you.

149
00:12:18,472 --> 00:12:20,374
<i>But for me to do my job,</i>

150
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:24,211
<i>I need you to be</i>
<i>candid with me.</i>

151
00:12:24,245 --> 00:12:25,446
<i>Does that make sense?</i>

152
00:12:28,082 --> 00:12:29,750
<i>Can I have a cigarette?</i>

153
00:12:30,384 --> 00:12:31,318
<i>Of course you can.</i>

154
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:39,360
<i>Let's start</i>
<i>with the first incident, okay?</i>

155
00:12:40,461 --> 00:12:45,966
<i>The three men who accosted you</i>
<i>on the subway, who bullied you,</i>

156
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,335
<i>did it feel like they</i>
<i>triggered something painful?</i>

157
00:12:48,369 --> 00:12:50,070
<i>From your past? Your childhood?</i>

158
00:12:51,573 --> 00:12:53,374
Do you remember
any of what happened?

159
00:12:57,478 --> 00:13:00,381
Did you... black out?

160
00:13:00,414 --> 00:13:02,016
See bright lights?

161
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,852
Mm...

162
00:13:09,223 --> 00:13:10,057
Okay.

163
00:13:14,028 --> 00:13:15,496
How about Murray Franklin?

164
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:19,900
What, if anything, do you
remember about that night?

165
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:28,475
<i>The music.</i>

166
00:13:31,445 --> 00:13:33,914
<i>That's good.</i>
<i>Arthur, that is good.</i>

167
00:13:36,584 --> 00:13:38,485
Can I tell you what I remember
about that night?

168
00:13:40,254 --> 00:13:44,224
I remember you came out
dressed as Joker.

169
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:49,897
And I remember Joker
was dancing to that music.

170
00:13:50,632 --> 00:13:51,566
<i>Right?</i>

171
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:56,103
<i>I really liked his band.</i>

172
00:13:58,072 --> 00:14:02,343
<i>My mom and I u-- used</i>
<i>to watch the show together.</i>

173
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,012
<i>She liked</i>
<i>Murray Franklin as well?</i>

174
00:14:07,481 --> 00:14:09,551
<i>"He's so handsome.</i>

175
00:14:09,584 --> 00:14:11,452
<i>Look at those</i>
<i>sparkling white teeth."</i>

176
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:16,290
Is that your mother's voice?

177
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:18,325
Mm.

178
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:19,893
Do you often hear her voice
in your head?

179
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:23,330
All the time.

180
00:14:26,367 --> 00:14:28,603
Did it change
at all after she died?

181
00:14:29,704 --> 00:14:31,171
What does that mean?

182
00:14:31,673 --> 00:14:32,906
Did you...

183
00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:36,477
this other part of you...

184
00:14:37,945 --> 00:14:39,413
Joker...

185
00:14:40,147 --> 00:14:42,617
Did it come out more
after she died?

186
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:45,352
You lived together, right?
In a one-bedroom apartment?

187
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,427
Maybe I could talk to Joker
about it.

188
00:14:55,396 --> 00:14:56,930
Would he like to talk to me?

189
00:15:25,727 --> 00:15:26,694
Hey, Arthur.

190
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:28,696
Arthur.

191
00:15:29,831 --> 00:15:30,899
I mean,
he'll do anything. Anything.

192
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:33,100
The guards said you wanted
to show me how to kiss.

193
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,405
But they said Joker's
a really good kisser.

194
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:40,974
Nobody's ever gave me
a kiss before.

195
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:46,514
Twenty bucks
says he chokes him.

196
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:56,290
There you go.

197
00:15:57,324 --> 00:15:59,259
Ricky don't know what hit him.

198
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:00,994
There was no hesitation.

199
00:16:01,028 --> 00:16:02,396
Yeah, yeah.

200
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:03,330
Kinda like...

201
00:16:05,767 --> 00:16:07,602
I gotta be honest with you,
Arthur.

202
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:11,205
I wouldn't have took you
for a hopeless romantic.

203
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:12,439
Can I have a cigarette?

204
00:16:13,808 --> 00:16:15,342
Why not.

205
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,778
Oh, no, no, no.
What are you doing?

206
00:16:16,811 --> 00:16:19,046
He doesn't get a cigarette
unless he tells a joke.

207
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:21,114
No, come on. He still
makes us laugh, doesn't he?

208
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:23,116
Barely.

209
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:23,885
Hey.

210
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:27,154
Remember that music class
we saw?

211
00:16:27,522 --> 00:16:29,791
The other day? B Ward?

212
00:16:29,824 --> 00:16:32,092
Remember, with all the singing?

213
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,995
I got you in.
We're going next week.

214
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:37,231
Bullshit.

215
00:16:37,264 --> 00:16:39,767
-The fuck you do that for?
-Eh, eh. No, no.

216
00:16:39,801 --> 00:16:41,803
Went and saw Kellerman,
I said...

217
00:16:41,836 --> 00:16:44,071
you've been good.
You deserve it.

218
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:46,641
The hell is he thinking?

219
00:16:46,674 --> 00:16:48,510
Yeah.

220
00:16:48,543 --> 00:16:51,044
He knows he can get
some good press for it.

221
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:53,247
Plus, I told him
I'd go along with him.

222
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,549
Oh, ho, there it is.

223
00:16:54,582 --> 00:16:56,618
That explains it.

224
00:16:56,651 --> 00:16:58,720
Count! Let's go.

225
00:16:58,753 --> 00:17:00,087
Line up by two.

226
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,456
Ricky. Come on, Romeo,
line 'em up.

227
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:05,225
Let's go. Twos.
Line up by twos.

228
00:17:05,259 --> 00:17:06,193
Come on, let's go.

229
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:08,262
Are you being serious?

230
00:17:08,295 --> 00:17:09,396
I am being serious.

231
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:11,298
On the Bible.

232
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:13,768
Wasn't that hard, either.

233
00:17:15,837 --> 00:17:18,138
Ever since they made
that TV movie about you,

234
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:20,274
everybody still thinks
you're a star.

235
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:23,745
How about you, Arthur?

236
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:26,413
Do you still think
you're a star?

237
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,618
I bet you do, don't you?

Group, I want you to welcome
Arthur Fleck.

262
00:20:19,954 --> 00:20:23,390
Now, I know it's odd to have
an inmate from E Ward in here,

263
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:26,527
but I have been assured
he's been a model patient

264
00:20:26,561 --> 00:20:28,261
without any incidents.

265
00:20:29,964 --> 00:20:33,634
I know this might feel strange,
Mr. Fleck, a new environment.

266
00:20:33,668 --> 00:20:37,538
You see, we use music
in this class to make us whole,

267
00:20:37,572 --> 00:20:39,874
to balance
the conflicting forces, the...

268
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:44,344
...the fractures
within ourselves.

269
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:47,615
All I ask is that you sing,

270
00:20:47,648 --> 00:20:50,317
if and when
you're ready to sing.

271
00:20:51,986 --> 00:20:53,855

No, no, no, I can't really.

00:21:07,635 --> 00:21:09,670

So, what's a nice guy like you
doing in a place like this?

293
00:21:46,406 --> 00:21:48,075
I killed five people.

294
00:21:48,109 --> 00:21:50,343
One live on national television.

295
00:21:51,512 --> 00:21:52,479
What about you?

296
00:21:54,447 --> 00:21:56,851
I set fire to my parents'
apartment building.

297
00:22:00,855 --> 00:22:01,889
Actually...

298
00:22:03,658 --> 00:22:04,725
...it was six.

299
00:22:06,093 --> 00:22:08,062
Nobody knows,
but also I killed my mother.

300
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:12,800
I should have done that.

301
00:22:13,601 --> 00:22:15,536
My mother had me committed.

302
00:22:15,837 --> 00:22:17,505
She says I'm psychotic.

303
00:22:20,575 --> 00:22:22,375
You know, I must've watched
that TV movie

304
00:22:22,409 --> 00:22:24,011
they made about you,
like, 20 times.

305
00:22:24,846 --> 00:22:26,781
Yeah. Was it good?

306
00:22:27,982 --> 00:22:29,817
They won't let me watch it.

307
00:22:29,851 --> 00:22:30,918
It was good.

308
00:22:32,186 --> 00:22:33,754
It was really good.

309
00:22:34,589 --> 00:22:36,524
I grew up
in the same neighborhood.

310
00:22:36,557 --> 00:22:38,425
Me and my friends
used to take that staircase

311
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,127
to school every day.

312
00:22:40,995 --> 00:22:43,164
My parents didn't
give a fuck about me either.

313
00:22:43,197 --> 00:22:45,099
My father beat the shit
out of me.

314
00:22:48,669 --> 00:22:50,437
Well, guess what?

315
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,939
"Knock, knock."

316
00:22:51,973 --> 00:22:54,575
"Sorry, kid, your dad
was killed in a car accident."

317
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,849
Sorry. That's not funny.

318
00:23:06,821 --> 00:23:09,557
If only those friends
could see me now.

319
00:23:12,593 --> 00:23:15,495
When I first saw Joker,

320
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:18,099
when I saw you
on <i>Murray Franklin,</i>

321
00:23:18,132 --> 00:23:21,468
the whole time I was watching,

Yeah.

523
00:38:03,084 --> 00:38:04,886

Come here.

00:38:13,027 --> 00:38:14,327
What?

527
00:38:14,862 --> 00:38:16,697
Come on. Can you get up?

528
00:38:19,066 --> 00:38:20,635
Come into the light.

529
00:38:29,744 --> 00:38:31,478
They're sending me home.

530
00:38:32,412 --> 00:38:34,916
What? Why?

531
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:37,819
They're saying you're
a bad influence on me.

532
00:38:40,121 --> 00:38:41,354
What?

533
00:38:43,825 --> 00:38:45,960
This is gonna be good for us.

534
00:38:45,993 --> 00:38:47,695
Now, I can be at your trial
every day.

535
00:38:47,728 --> 00:38:49,630
I can see you every day
until you get out.

536
00:38:52,166 --> 00:38:53,568
And then what?

537
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:57,805
We're gonna build a mountain.

538
00:39:02,143 --> 00:39:03,611
Wait, wait.

539
00:39:16,691 --> 00:39:17,992
You brought make-up.

540
00:39:19,426 --> 00:39:21,095
I want to see the real you.

541
00:39:46,453 --> 00:39:48,122
Look what they did to you.

542
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:31,464
It's just us now.

543
00:40:41,509 --> 00:40:43,911
You need to stop
taking your medication.

544
00:40:43,945 --> 00:40:45,713
I already have.

545
00:41:05,933 --> 00:41:07,268
Can you do it?

546
00:41:07,301 --> 00:41:08,703
Yeah.

547
00:41:47,241 --> 00:41:49,543
What's he gonna ask me about?

548
00:41:49,577 --> 00:41:51,879
Besides... you know.

549
00:41:53,147 --> 00:41:55,983
Well, hopefully,
about your life in here,

550
00:41:56,684 --> 00:41:59,186
and what the conditions
are really like in this place.

551
00:42:00,654 --> 00:42:03,257
He might ask you about Lee.

552
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:06,594
She's been out there giving
a lot of interviews about you.

553
00:42:06,627 --> 00:42:07,695
And about herself.

554
00:42:08,362 --> 00:42:09,663
Good.

555
00:42:10,765 --> 00:42:12,133
You know, I love her.

556
00:42:13,934 --> 00:42:15,202
She gets me.

557
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:18,072
Two minutes. Paddy's ready.

558
00:42:19,006 --> 00:42:20,241
Arthur.

559
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:24,145
This is a chance for you to show
a different side of yourself.

560
00:42:25,212 --> 00:42:28,916
So the public can see
who you really are.

561
00:42:28,949 --> 00:42:30,217
And I don't think
you should smoke.

562
00:42:30,251 --> 00:42:32,686
I think it makes you
look cavalier.

563
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,687
Okay.

564
00:42:33,721 --> 00:42:35,823
We need to use this time

565
00:42:35,856 --> 00:42:38,659
to show people
that you're human.

566
00:42:39,727 --> 00:42:42,997
They need to understand
you were sick. Delusional.

567
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:44,365
Mm-hm.

568
00:42:44,398 --> 00:42:48,302
You're not Joker.
You're Arthur Fleck.

569
00:42:48,335 --> 00:42:49,737
Hm?

570
00:42:50,971 --> 00:42:53,007
Don't worry.
You're gonna be great.

571
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:57,611
Arthur.

572
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:04,752
Are you okay? It's--

573
00:43:06,187 --> 00:43:08,022
It's not too late to cancel.

574
00:43:12,927 --> 00:43:18,099
So, uh... you want me
to call you Arthur or The Joker?

575
00:43:18,132 --> 00:43:20,101
Mr. Meyers,
you know we have an agreement.

576
00:43:20,134 --> 00:43:21,969
You can't call him "Joker."

577
00:43:22,002 --> 00:43:24,205
It's Arthur. Arthur Fleck.

578
00:43:26,307 --> 00:43:27,875
When you're ready, Paddy.

579
00:43:28,776 --> 00:43:30,344
She has to leave now.

580
00:43:31,145 --> 00:43:32,179
You can watch
from behind the glass,

581
00:43:32,213 --> 00:43:33,180
but you can't be in here.

582
00:43:34,381 --> 00:43:35,783
Just be yourself.

583
00:43:45,392 --> 00:43:47,228
-We rolling?
-Rolling.

584
00:43:50,297 --> 00:43:51,398
<i>Cameras up.</i>

585
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,236
<i>Two years ago,</i>
<i>the name Arthur Fleck</i>

586
00:43:55,269 --> 00:43:57,738
<i>hit Gotham like a hurricane.</i>

587
00:43:57,771 --> 00:43:59,907
An unassuming part-time
party clown

588
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:02,042
and struggling stand-up comic,

589
00:44:02,076 --> 00:44:04,945
Fleck committed
five horrific murders

590
00:44:04,979 --> 00:44:07,014
in the span of just four weeks.

591
00:44:07,281 --> 00:44:10,951
And now, with hundreds
already lining up to get a seat

592
00:44:10,985 --> 00:44:14,255
at one of the first trials
ever broadcast live on TV,

<i>Arthur Fleck, The Joker,</i>

00:44:19,393 --> 00:44:22,363

596
00:44:22,396 --> 00:44:25,933
<i>And yes, we all know</i>
<i>how that turned out.</i>

597
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:31,739
Arthur Fleck, welcome.

598
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:33,374
Hello.

599
00:44:34,576 --> 00:44:38,212
Take me back to that night
onstage with Murray Franklin.

600
00:44:39,113 --> 00:44:42,116
What was going
through your mind...

601
00:44:42,149 --> 00:44:44,685
when you pulled out that gun
and blew his brains out?

602
00:44:48,455 --> 00:44:51,258
Well, Paddy, um...

603
00:44:54,862 --> 00:44:57,965
I was going through a lot
back then. Um...

604
00:44:57,998 --> 00:45:02,069
I don't really remember much
from that night. I, uh...

605
00:45:02,102 --> 00:45:05,005
blacked out,
I saw bright lights.

606
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:07,441
<i>I was having a hard time</i>

607
00:45:07,474 --> 00:45:10,044
<i>knowing the difference</i>
<i>between what was real or not.</i>

608
00:45:10,077 --> 00:45:11,212
<i>Oh, please.</i>

609
00:45:11,245 --> 00:45:13,480
You did it on live TV, pal.

610
00:45:13,515 --> 00:45:14,982
Doesn't get any more real
than that.

611
00:45:16,417 --> 00:45:18,219
Paddy, all I remember
from that night

612
00:45:18,252 --> 00:45:20,387
is I was gonna kill myself.

613
00:45:20,421 --> 00:45:22,056
On television.

614
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:25,826
I thought Murray
was playing a part in my show.

615
00:45:26,927 --> 00:45:28,495
But he was a bad actor.

616
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:30,898
So he got what he deserved.

617
00:45:31,265 --> 00:45:33,867
Your last joke,
if we can call it a joke,

618
00:45:33,901 --> 00:45:35,537
"You get
what you bleeping deserve."

619
00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:36,837
That's what you said.

620
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:39,440
That's not fun,
that's not funny.

621
00:45:39,473 --> 00:45:42,476
You're right, I...
I should have told a better one.

622
00:45:44,311 --> 00:45:45,879
You're trying to be funny now?

623
00:45:46,447 --> 00:45:47,281
No.

624
00:45:49,917 --> 00:45:52,820
Do you deserve to die?

625
00:45:53,153 --> 00:45:55,022
The DA is calling
for the death penalty.

626
00:45:55,055 --> 00:45:57,358
You just said that you wanted
to kill yourself on TV.

627
00:45:57,391 --> 00:45:58,359
So, tell us...

628
00:45:59,561 --> 00:46:01,529
...you still wanna die?

629
00:46:02,997 --> 00:46:06,267
Well, at the time, it certainly
seemed a lot easier than living.

630
00:46:06,967 --> 00:46:10,237
Um, but that's...
that's not me anymore.

631
00:46:10,271 --> 00:46:11,305
That's not...

632
00:46:12,574 --> 00:46:13,807
That's not who I am.

633
00:46:13,841 --> 00:46:14,975
That wasn't really you.

634
00:46:15,009 --> 00:46:16,143
No, that's not right.

635
00:46:16,176 --> 00:46:17,444
Let me get this straight.

636
00:46:17,478 --> 00:46:19,547
-That's not what I meant.
-So your defense is,

637
00:46:19,581 --> 00:46:21,516
"It was The Joker who did it."

638
00:46:21,549 --> 00:46:23,350
-An insanity defense.
-Okay, I don't--

639
00:46:23,384 --> 00:46:24,885
I don't know about a defense.

640
00:46:24,918 --> 00:46:27,221
That this alternate personality,

641
00:46:27,254 --> 00:46:30,491
this killer clown in you
killed Murray.

642
00:46:30,525 --> 00:46:33,394
Who am I speaking to now?
Which one of you is here?

643
00:46:33,427 --> 00:46:36,463
The poor, low IQ Arthur Fleck?

644
00:46:36,497 --> 00:46:38,932
Or The Joker, who goaded
a bunch of no-good punks--

645
00:46:38,966 --> 00:46:40,501
Do you really care?

646
00:46:41,368 --> 00:46:42,504
You don't.

647
00:46:43,538 --> 00:46:45,339
You're just like Murray.

648
00:46:45,372 --> 00:46:47,975
You're just like everyone.
You want sensationalism.

649
00:46:48,008 --> 00:46:49,209
You don't care about...

650
00:46:49,243 --> 00:46:51,378
You just wanna talk
about my mistakes.

651
00:46:51,412 --> 00:46:52,980
You wanna talk about the things
that I did in the past.

652
00:46:53,013 --> 00:46:54,315
Not about who I am now.

653
00:46:54,348 --> 00:46:56,450
Not how I'm different now.

654
00:46:58,252 --> 00:47:01,288
That's what we should be
talking about, Paddy.

655
00:47:02,956 --> 00:47:04,425
Okay, okay.

656
00:47:05,527 --> 00:47:07,562
-We should take a break.
-We're not taking a break.

657
00:47:07,595 --> 00:47:08,829
<i>All right.</i>

658
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:15,570
Okay, so, tell us...
what's changed, Arthur?

659
00:47:16,571 --> 00:47:19,340
Well, I'll tell you
what's changed, Paddy.

660
00:47:20,441 --> 00:47:22,544
I'm not alone anymore.

661
00:47:23,678 --> 00:47:25,379
Right.

662
00:47:25,412 --> 00:47:29,249
The girl who was singing.
The night you tried to escape.

663
00:47:29,283 --> 00:47:31,385
We weren't trying to escape.

664
00:47:31,418 --> 00:47:32,386
Miss Harley Quinzel.

665
00:47:35,089 --> 00:47:37,291
You two put on
quite a performance that night.

666
00:47:37,324 --> 00:47:38,459
Aww...

667
00:47:40,662 --> 00:47:42,863
She's really something,
isn't she?

668
00:47:43,598 --> 00:47:45,099
You tell me.

669
00:47:45,533 --> 00:47:47,401
I mean,
don't you think it's all...

670
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:51,438
...don't you think
it's a little too much?

671
00:47:53,173 --> 00:47:54,908
A little much?

Everything okay?

Yes, Your Majesty.

It's my view that there is
absolutely no evidence

774
00:56:49,677 --> 00:56:53,214
that Arthur Fleck suffers from
multiple personality disorder.

775
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:57,919
Or that he ever behaved
in the role of "Joker,"

776
00:56:57,952 --> 00:57:02,924
as a separate personality
dissociated from himself.

777
00:57:03,691 --> 00:57:05,793
Doctor, in your opinion,

778
00:57:05,826 --> 00:57:08,596
concerning the work
you did on this case,

779
00:57:08,629 --> 00:57:13,734
do you believe Mr. Fleck suffers
from a mental disease or defect?

780
00:57:13,768 --> 00:57:16,504
No. In my opinion,

781
00:57:16,537 --> 00:57:21,509
he's not psychotic
or unable to test reality.

782
00:57:21,542 --> 00:57:24,512
I think he was sane
when he committed these crimes.

783
00:57:24,912 --> 00:57:28,916
In fact, I believe he fakes
his mental illness.

784
00:57:30,952 --> 00:57:32,019
Quiet.

785
00:57:35,256 --> 00:57:37,825
And... if he's, uh...

786
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:41,494
...faking it, as you say,

787
00:57:42,563 --> 00:57:43,965
then what is your opinion

788
00:57:43,998 --> 00:57:47,535
on the defendant's
mental condition?

789
00:57:47,568 --> 00:57:50,071
I believe he has
four relatively minor

790
00:57:50,104 --> 00:57:52,974
and quite common
mental disorders

791
00:57:53,007 --> 00:57:56,744
that involve
long-standing sadness,

792
00:57:56,777 --> 00:58:00,982
narcissistic self-centeredness,
friendlessness,

793
00:58:01,015 --> 00:58:03,784
an indifference
to the feelings of others.

794
00:58:03,818 --> 00:58:06,287
This is
a very disturbed individual.

795
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:11,525
But I can't give you any kind
of psychiatric defense for him.

796
00:58:11,826 --> 00:58:13,594
Thank you, Doctor Liu.

797
00:58:14,996 --> 00:58:16,263
Nothing further, Your Honor.

798
00:58:18,299 --> 00:58:19,967
Your witness, Ms. Stewart.

799
00:58:20,735 --> 00:58:21,535
Thank you.

800
00:58:24,105 --> 00:58:26,841
Doctor Liu, good morning.

801
00:58:26,874 --> 00:58:27,908
Morning.

802
00:58:29,577 --> 00:58:31,278
How long did you interview
Arthur Fleck for?

803
00:58:31,712 --> 00:58:33,047
About two hours.

804
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:34,615
About two hours.

805
00:58:35,783 --> 00:58:37,585
It was actually 89 minutes.

806
00:58:38,786 --> 00:58:41,822
Tell me,
how can you say for certain,

807
00:58:41,856 --> 00:58:44,058
that Arthur isn't mentally ill?

808
00:58:44,859 --> 00:58:48,129
How can you be so sure
after just 89 minutes,

809
00:58:48,162 --> 00:58:50,698
that this "Joker"

810
00:58:50,731 --> 00:58:54,902
isn't a distinctly separate
and split personality from him?

811
00:58:54,935 --> 00:58:57,271
That that's not who he is.

812
00:58:57,304 --> 00:59:00,808
Well, I also reviewed
all the test results.

813
00:59:00,841 --> 00:59:05,713
Psychological tests,
neurological and medical tests.

814
00:59:05,746 --> 00:59:08,816
And in my view,
it's just a performance.

815
00:59:10,017 --> 00:59:11,585
Did you read the records

816
00:59:11,619 --> 00:59:13,721
from the
Department of Social Services...

817
00:59:14,922 --> 00:59:18,793
...that show that when Arthur
was seven years old,

818
00:59:18,826 --> 00:59:20,895
they returned him
to his abuser's home?

819
00:59:22,897 --> 00:59:25,199
His mother's home.

820
00:59:25,232 --> 00:59:27,234
I did, yes.

821
00:59:28,302 --> 00:59:31,305
And when you
interviewed him for 89 minutes,

822
00:59:32,273 --> 00:59:35,076
did you ask him
why Social Services

823
00:59:35,109 --> 00:59:37,745
didn't believe
the horrific stories

824
00:59:37,778 --> 00:59:40,748
a seven-year-old boy told them

825
00:59:40,781 --> 00:59:43,651
about the physical
and sexual abuse he suffered?

826
00:59:48,022 --> 00:59:51,058
No, I...
I didn't ask him about that.

827
00:59:51,092 --> 00:59:52,927
Hmm.

828
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:55,796
So you want us to believe,

829
00:59:56,797 --> 01:00:02,069
that after spending just
89 minutes with Arthur Fleck,

830
01:00:02,103 --> 01:00:06,273
and reading through
his records and tests

831
01:00:06,307 --> 01:00:09,944
from the same government
agencies that abandoned him,

832
01:00:09,977 --> 01:00:11,779
you want us to believe

833
01:00:11,812 --> 01:00:15,249
that you can say
with absolute certainty

834
01:00:15,282 --> 01:00:19,887
that Arthur doesn't suffer
from any serious mental illness?

835
01:00:20,855 --> 01:00:24,125
That he didn't need
to retreat into fantasy

836
01:00:24,158 --> 01:00:26,827
and create another identity

837
01:00:26,861 --> 01:00:32,933
to protect that scared,
vulnerable, seven-year-old boy

838
01:00:32,967 --> 01:00:35,970
from all the trauma and abuse
he suffered?

839
01:00:36,971 --> 01:00:40,674
And that that identity
didn't come out again,

840
01:00:40,875 --> 01:00:43,878
when he was
attacked and tormented

841
01:00:43,911 --> 01:00:47,148
by three drunk bullies
on the subway?

842
01:00:51,452 --> 01:00:53,387
<i>"After I woke up this morning,</i>

843
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:56,891
<i>I thought,</i>
<i>'Murray, Murray, Murray.'</i>

844
01:00:56,924 --> 01:00:59,393
And then there's Murray.

845
01:00:59,827 --> 01:01:00,961
Funny, right?

846
01:01:01,896 --> 01:01:03,764
Then I remember Sophie.

847
01:01:03,797 --> 01:01:06,200
-I had anoth--"
-Objection. Your Honor...

848
01:01:06,233 --> 01:01:09,136
Again, my client's
personal diary is privileged.

849
01:01:09,170 --> 01:01:10,738
Overruled.

850
01:01:10,771 --> 01:01:13,807
Again, as long as Mrs. Kane
limits her comments

851
01:01:13,841 --> 01:01:15,242
to Mr. Fleck's journals--

852
01:01:15,276 --> 01:01:16,911
But these are my own
personal private jokes.

853
01:01:16,944 --> 01:01:18,045
They weren't meant
to be read out loud.

854
01:01:18,078 --> 01:01:19,780
Mr. Fleck. Quiet!

855
01:01:21,315 --> 01:01:24,118
These are your words
she's reading.

856
01:01:24,151 --> 01:01:25,286
And it's up to the jury

857
01:01:25,319 --> 01:01:27,054
to determine
what to make of them.

858
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:30,991
Please proceed.

859
01:01:32,527 --> 01:01:34,461
Ms. Kane,
please continue reading

860
01:01:34,495 --> 01:01:37,164
from the, uh...
the highlighted portion.

861
01:01:38,232 --> 01:01:40,267
"Then I remember Sophie.

862
01:01:40,868 --> 01:01:43,137
Had another dream about her.
Forgot it.

863
01:01:44,338 --> 01:01:46,473
<i>I almost never dream.</i>

864
01:01:46,508 --> 01:01:49,043
What do I gotta do to remember?"

865
01:01:49,076 --> 01:01:51,478
That's Sophie Dumond,
Mr. Fleck's neighbor,

866
01:01:51,513 --> 01:01:53,847
whom he was obsessed with.

867
01:01:53,881 --> 01:01:54,715
What was that date?

868
01:01:55,517 --> 01:01:57,151
November 17.

869
01:01:58,419 --> 01:02:00,754
Let the record show,

870
01:02:00,788 --> 01:02:03,857
November 17th
is the day that Mr. Fleck

871
01:02:03,891 --> 01:02:06,493
stabbed Randall Kleinmanhoffer
to death.

872
01:02:07,494 --> 01:02:13,467
The very same day that he shot
and killed Murray Franklin.

873
01:02:14,501 --> 01:02:18,806
Now, I know it's not
your area of expertise,

874
01:02:18,839 --> 01:02:20,040
but you have read all of

875
01:02:20,074 --> 01:02:22,076
Mr. Fleck's journal before,
correct?

876
01:02:22,109 --> 01:02:23,410
Yes, I have.

877
01:02:23,444 --> 01:02:26,247
And in your opinion,

878
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:29,817
does this sound
like a different voice?

879
01:02:30,851 --> 01:02:35,189
Like a different, uh...
personality wrote this?

880
01:02:36,991 --> 01:02:38,392
No, it sounds like Arthur.

881
01:02:39,326 --> 01:02:41,128
Go on.

882
01:02:41,161 --> 01:02:44,131
He often wrote about
his fantasies.

883
01:02:45,966 --> 01:02:51,071
And... the... women he had
imaginary relationships with.

884
01:02:52,339 --> 01:02:55,442
<i>And of course, his jokes.</i>

885
01:02:55,476 --> 01:02:59,880
<i>There were always</i>
<i>a lot of... these...</i>

886
01:02:59,913 --> 01:03:02,116
<i>these unfunny jokes.</i>

887
01:03:04,251 --> 01:03:05,486
She's just a social worker.

888
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:07,354
I don't think
she's even qualified--

889
01:03:07,388 --> 01:03:09,356
You know, you're making him out
to be a fucking idiot in there.

890
01:03:10,891 --> 01:03:13,260
He's never gonna get out
if you keep this shit up.

891
01:03:13,294 --> 01:03:15,829
Ask her why she has me
sitting so far away from him.

892
01:03:16,430 --> 01:03:18,232
Let's not do this here. Please?

893
01:03:18,265 --> 01:03:20,134
Do you see
all those people out front?

894
01:03:20,167 --> 01:03:21,869
Who do you think
they're here for?

895
01:03:21,902 --> 01:03:23,837
How many T-shirts
is Arthur Fleck on?

896
01:03:24,905 --> 01:03:26,508
How many signs?

897
01:03:26,541 --> 01:03:28,008
It's the Trial of the Century

898
01:03:28,042 --> 01:03:30,512
and she doesn't even know
who her own client is.

899
01:03:30,545 --> 01:03:33,113
-What do you mean by that?
-Can't you see how sick he is?

900
01:03:33,147 --> 01:03:35,049
How much help he needs?

901
01:03:35,617 --> 01:03:37,217
He's not sick.

902
01:03:38,586 --> 01:03:40,354
He's perfect.

903
01:03:40,387 --> 01:03:41,922
You don't really think
he's just gonna

904
01:03:41,955 --> 01:03:43,924
walk out of here, do you?

905
01:03:43,957 --> 01:03:45,926
Yeah, he's gonna walk
right outta here.

906
01:03:46,427 --> 01:03:48,896
-With me by his side.
-And then what?

907
01:03:50,164 --> 01:03:52,166
Any further statements?

908
01:03:52,199 --> 01:03:54,134
And then we're gonna
build a mountain.

909
01:03:54,168 --> 01:03:56,538
-A what?
-From a little hill.

910
01:03:56,571 --> 01:03:59,340
What does that even mean?

911
01:03:59,373 --> 01:04:00,874
-Are you going to get married?
-Move!

912
01:04:03,143 --> 01:04:04,512
You're not listening.

913
01:04:04,546 --> 01:04:07,081
We can win this case,
and she's gonna fuck it all up.

914
01:04:07,114 --> 01:04:09,416
No, you're not listening.

915
01:04:09,450 --> 01:04:11,185
Lee's looking out for me.

916
01:04:13,287 --> 01:04:15,422
She understands
what I've been through.

917
01:04:15,456 --> 01:04:17,157
What are you talking about?

918
01:04:17,592 --> 01:04:20,127
We're from
the same neighborhood.

919
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:24,331
She lost her father. You know...
her mom was awful to her.

920
01:04:24,365 --> 01:04:25,966
She had her committed.

921
01:04:25,999 --> 01:04:28,335
So just give her a break.

922
01:04:29,671 --> 01:04:32,306
Okay, Lee cares about you, sure.

923
01:04:32,339 --> 01:04:33,907
I know.

924
01:04:34,408 --> 01:04:36,477
But she didn't grow up
in your neighborhood.

925
01:04:36,511 --> 01:04:39,581
She lives on the Upper West Side
with her parents.

926
01:04:39,614 --> 01:04:42,916
Her father is not dead,
he's a doctor.

927
01:04:43,450 --> 01:04:45,252
She voluntarily
committed herself

928
01:04:45,285 --> 01:04:46,453
to the hospital,

929
01:04:46,487 --> 01:04:48,288
and then just
checked herself out

930
01:04:48,322 --> 01:04:49,456
when she wanted to.

931
01:04:49,490 --> 01:04:51,325
She didn't check herself out.

932
01:04:51,358 --> 01:04:53,093
Arthur.

933
01:04:53,127 --> 01:04:55,530
I was a bad influence on her,
so they separated us.

934
01:04:58,332 --> 01:05:01,435
Did she mention she went
to grad school for psychiatry?

935
01:05:01,468 --> 01:05:04,506
You wouldn't get it.

936
01:05:05,339 --> 01:05:09,076
My point is she's playing you
for a fool.

937
01:05:10,512 --> 01:05:12,146
I'm sorry, I just--

938
01:05:13,581 --> 01:05:16,150
I know what it's like
to love somebody.

939
01:05:16,183 --> 01:05:18,586
But I don't think you can
believe a word she says.

962
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:58,285
What happened?

963
01:06:59,152 --> 01:07:01,689
Well, you weren't even looking
at me anymore.

964
01:07:01,723 --> 01:07:03,257
You were making it
all about yourself.

965
01:07:03,290 --> 01:07:05,660
And the song...

966
01:07:05,693 --> 01:07:08,195
is about loving me!

967
01:07:09,831 --> 01:07:12,332
Now look who's making it
all about themselves.

968
01:07:12,366 --> 01:07:13,701
Oh...

969
01:07:14,268 --> 01:07:16,069
So you're saying
it's not about us?

970
01:07:16,403 --> 01:07:19,574
It is, but we're singing
for them.

971
01:07:19,607 --> 01:07:21,709
That's why we're here, honey.

972
01:07:21,743 --> 01:07:25,145
Oh! 'Cause I got
this sneaking suspicion

973
01:07:25,178 --> 01:07:27,582
that we're not giving the people
what they want.

974
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:29,751
It's okay baby, you're right.

975
01:07:32,185 --> 01:07:33,521
Let's give the people
what they want.

976
01:07:35,823 --> 01:07:38,091
Music.
Let's take it from the top.

977
01:07:45,465 --> 01:07:46,834
Is the honeymoon over?

978
01:07:54,876 --> 01:07:56,076
What?

979
01:07:59,446 --> 01:08:00,848
Why'd you-- Why'd you do that?

980
01:08:09,924 --> 01:08:11,526
Pew!

981
01:08:12,426 --> 01:08:13,728
Pew!

982
01:08:15,362 --> 01:08:16,731
-Get Healey.
-Pew!

983
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:20,868
Ba-room!

984
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:28,543
Well, look at you.

985
01:08:28,576 --> 01:08:32,179
Couple of weeks back on TV
and already acting
like you own the joint.

986
01:08:32,212 --> 01:08:34,549
What the fuck are you two doing
sitting on our bleachers?

987
01:08:34,582 --> 01:08:36,483
Who said they're your bleachers?

988
01:08:36,517 --> 01:08:38,886
Ricky, what the fuck
has gotten into you?

989
01:08:39,654 --> 01:08:41,656
You heard me. Up.

990
01:08:42,356 --> 01:08:43,891
Guess who I just saw out front?

991
01:08:45,693 --> 01:08:47,194
Your little lady friend.

992
01:08:48,696 --> 01:08:50,732
All right, enough.
Get up, both of you.

993
01:08:50,765 --> 01:08:52,900
Hey, Fleck, you got a visitor.

994
01:08:56,436 --> 01:08:58,205
See, Arthur? What'd I tell ya?

995
01:09:00,207 --> 01:09:01,341
Move it!

996
01:09:04,444 --> 01:09:05,647
Every day, this asshole.

997
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:15,590
You're a real
fucking whack job, Fleck.

998
01:09:17,992 --> 01:09:19,493
Uh-uh!

999
01:09:33,608 --> 01:09:34,909
Hey.

1000
01:09:34,942 --> 01:09:36,243
Five minutes.

1001
01:09:41,248 --> 01:09:42,517
How are you holding up?

1002
01:09:54,428 --> 01:09:56,229
Is everything okay?

1003
01:10:02,870 --> 01:10:05,205
Did you-- Did you lie to me?

1004
01:10:09,010 --> 01:10:10,645
Sure.

1005
01:10:11,411 --> 01:10:13,280
I mean, everybody lies a little.

1006
01:10:17,552 --> 01:10:20,420
And you're not from
the same neighborhood as me?

1007
01:10:20,454 --> 01:10:22,590
And your...
your dad's a doctor?

1008
01:10:23,691 --> 01:10:24,792
You're rich?

1009
01:10:26,928 --> 01:10:28,830
I just wanted you to like me.

1010
01:10:35,570 --> 01:10:37,471
Did you really
check yourself in here?

1011
01:10:38,940 --> 01:10:40,407
Yeah.

1012
01:10:44,746 --> 01:10:46,413
That's crazy.

1013
01:10:48,816 --> 01:10:52,520
Just... because you wanted
to meet me?

1014
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:54,689
Just to meet you.

1015
01:10:59,326 --> 01:11:01,596
You could have just
wrote me a letter.

1016
01:11:02,997 --> 01:11:06,266
And said what? I'm nobody.

1017
01:11:06,934 --> 01:11:09,137
I haven't done anything
with my life like you have.

1018
01:11:13,007 --> 01:11:14,709
Did you really watch
that TV movie

1019
01:11:14,742 --> 01:11:16,811
they made about me 20 times?

1020
01:11:16,844 --> 01:11:19,747
Um... probably more like
four or five.

1021
01:11:24,819 --> 01:11:26,821
Was it actually good,
or did you lie about that too?

1022
01:11:27,121 --> 01:11:28,723
It was great.

1023
01:11:36,597 --> 01:11:40,601
My lawyer... says you're
playing me for a fool.

1024
01:11:41,869 --> 01:11:43,571
I'm no fool.

1025
01:11:45,106 --> 01:11:47,440
Can't you see what she's doing?

1026
01:11:47,942 --> 01:11:49,710
They're laughing at you
in there.

1027
01:11:52,513 --> 01:11:54,515
She doesn't care about you.

1028
01:11:56,517 --> 01:11:57,718
I do.

1029
01:12:00,054 --> 01:12:02,590
Do you know I moved
into your old apartment building

1030
01:12:02,623 --> 01:12:05,492
to make us a home
for when you get out?

1031
01:12:05,526 --> 01:12:07,662
Did your lawyer tell you that?

1032
01:12:08,428 --> 01:12:11,032
You did?

1033
01:12:11,065 --> 01:12:12,934
I don't want to live there.

1034
01:12:17,772 --> 01:12:18,940
I'm pregnant.

1035
01:12:24,145 --> 01:12:25,580

Did you think
he was gonna hurt you?

1063
01:15:00,968 --> 01:15:01,836
Or your daughter?

1064
01:15:02,870 --> 01:15:04,271
I did, yes.

1065
01:15:07,608 --> 01:15:08,843
You believed he was dangerous.

1066
01:15:10,945 --> 01:15:12,847
Well,
he broke into my apartment.

1067
01:15:14,715 --> 01:15:15,950
You call the police?

1068
01:15:17,351 --> 01:15:18,519
No.

1069
01:15:20,221 --> 01:15:23,057
His mother told me, uh...

1070
01:15:23,090 --> 01:15:25,793
that he'd had problems
his whole life, but that he...

1071
01:15:25,826 --> 01:15:27,628
wouldn't hurt a fly.

1072
01:15:30,264 --> 01:15:31,665
And...

1073
01:15:32,833 --> 01:15:37,304
...was the man who broke
into your apartment that night,

1074
01:15:37,905 --> 01:15:43,177
was he different in any way
from the Arthur Fleck you knew?

1075
01:15:44,612 --> 01:15:46,313
I didn't really know him.

1076
01:15:47,148 --> 01:15:50,818
I saw him in the lobby,
the elevator a few times.

1077
01:15:52,286 --> 01:15:53,988
Like I said,
I knew his mother a little bit.

1078
01:15:54,021 --> 01:15:56,257
She was really sweet
to my daughter.

1079
01:15:57,691 --> 01:15:59,060
And Ms. Dumond,

1080
01:16:00,394 --> 01:16:02,730
why is it that you didn't want
to come here and testify today?

1081
01:16:03,731 --> 01:16:07,001
And why did you initially
ignore our subpoenas?

1082
01:16:07,701 --> 01:16:10,971
Well,
after Arthur did what he did,

1083
01:16:12,306 --> 01:16:14,308
the press wanted
to talk to me about it.

1084
01:16:15,376 --> 01:16:17,244
And then I was a character

1085
01:16:17,278 --> 01:16:20,247
in that awful TV movie
they made, and...

1086
01:16:21,082 --> 01:16:22,016
-It was awful?
-Then all these people...

1087
01:16:22,049 --> 01:16:23,617
No.

1088
01:16:23,651 --> 01:16:26,120
...supporters, I guess,
like the people outside,

1089
01:16:26,153 --> 01:16:30,257
started showing up
at my work and harassing me,

1090
01:16:30,758 --> 01:16:32,660
blaming me for what happened
to Arthur.

1091
01:16:34,829 --> 01:16:37,264
So I was afraid for my safety
and for my daughter's safety.

1092
01:16:37,298 --> 01:16:38,833
We moved out of the city.

1093
01:16:39,266 --> 01:16:42,803
Well, then why did you
finally decide to comply?

1094
01:16:42,837 --> 01:16:44,705
Because I should have
called the police that night.

1095
01:16:47,174 --> 01:16:48,909
Then maybe all those people
wouldn't have been...

1096
01:16:51,078 --> 01:16:52,947
Maybe they wouldn't be
dead now if I did.

1097
01:16:54,849 --> 01:16:57,218
Thank you. No more questions.

1098
01:16:58,853 --> 01:17:00,688
Your witness, Ms. Stewart.

1099
01:17:03,224 --> 01:17:04,291
Ms. Dumond.

1100
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:08,929
What happened
after you asked Arthur

1101
01:17:08,963 --> 01:17:11,232
to leave your apartment
that night?

1102
01:17:11,265 --> 01:17:15,236
He told me he was having
a bad day. And then he left.

1103
01:17:15,269 --> 01:17:17,905
So, he never hurt
or even threatened

1104
01:17:17,938 --> 01:17:19,340
you or your daughter?

1105
01:17:21,108 --> 01:17:22,243
No.

1106
01:17:23,777 --> 01:17:26,347
And did you watch him on TV
on <i>Murray Franklin</i>
the following week?

1107
01:17:27,014 --> 01:17:28,282
I did.

1108
01:17:28,849 --> 01:17:31,218
And did that seem
like the same man

1109
01:17:31,252 --> 01:17:33,320
who was sitting
in your apartment that night?

1110
01:17:34,021 --> 01:17:37,858
Did he sound the same
or even look the same?

1111
01:17:38,292 --> 01:17:41,028
No, I mean, he was...
he was wearing clown make-up.

1112
01:17:42,830 --> 01:17:45,266
And while Arthur's mother

1113
01:17:45,299 --> 01:17:48,469
was being so sweet
to your daughter,

1114
01:17:48,502 --> 01:17:50,704
what was she telling you
about her own son?

1115
01:17:54,942 --> 01:17:56,277
Um...

1116
01:17:58,279 --> 01:18:00,848
She told me that there was
something wrong with Arthur,

1117
01:18:00,881 --> 01:18:03,284
and that he lived
in a fantasy world

1118
01:18:03,317 --> 01:18:06,353
and that he had this laugh.

1119
01:18:06,387 --> 01:18:08,822
She told you
it was a "dumb laugh."

1120
01:18:08,856 --> 01:18:11,025
<i>That's what she called it.</i>

1121
01:18:11,058 --> 01:18:13,127
<i>"His dumb laugh."</i>

1122
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:14,828
Yes.

1123
01:18:15,763 --> 01:18:17,097
What else did she tell you?

1124
01:18:19,099 --> 01:18:23,337
That she made up a story,
when he was a kid.

1125
01:18:24,305 --> 01:18:26,508
So that he would feel
better about it.

1126
01:18:26,541 --> 01:18:27,975
So that he would stop crying,

1127
01:18:28,008 --> 01:18:29,944
so that he wouldn't
kill himself.

1128
01:18:30,878 --> 01:18:32,213
What was the story?

1129
01:18:33,013 --> 01:18:35,983
That he was put
on this earth to bring joy.

1130
01:18:37,451 --> 01:18:39,453
Something like that.
It's why she called him "Happy."

1131
01:18:40,287 --> 01:18:41,222
And?

1132
01:18:41,255 --> 01:18:43,991
And she...

1133
01:18:44,024 --> 01:18:46,060
couldn't believe that
he based his whole life

1134
01:18:46,093 --> 01:18:48,128
around this made-up story.

1135
01:18:48,162 --> 01:18:51,198
He was a street clown,
and he wanted to be a comedian.

1136
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,136
She made fun of him
for doing that?

1137
01:18:56,170 --> 01:18:58,072
She just thought
it was ridiculous

1138
01:18:58,105 --> 01:18:59,406
that he thought
he could make people laugh.

1139
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:01,475
I mean, she said Arthur
wasn't funny at all.

1140
01:19:03,911 --> 01:19:05,212

Hey, no touching.

1193
01:23:05,653 --> 01:23:07,689
I'm so fucking proud of you.

1194
01:23:13,628 --> 01:23:17,565
You should see it out there.
They're all going crazy for you.

I know, but maybe I should read
a law book or something.

You know I never went

<i>Fleck, the accused killer,</i>
<i>also known as Joker,</i>

1207

<i>interrupted testimony</i>

<i>Then he kissed her goodbye.</i>

1210

<i>Afterwards, Fleck</i>
<i>was extensively questioned</i>

<i>by Judge Herman Rothwax.</i>

1212

<i>The right</i>

<i>Yes, sir.</i>

<i>Judge Rothwax reluctantly</i>

1217

<i>It's really tragic.</i>

1223

<i>Arthur believes he has</i>

After reviewing all the case law
that offers precedent,

1264
01:27:01,956 --> 01:27:05,225
<i>Jensen v. Superior Court</i>
being the most relevant,

1265
01:27:06,359 --> 01:27:08,029
I have reluctantly decided

1266
01:27:08,062 --> 01:27:11,032
that Mr. Fleck
does have the right

1267
01:27:11,065 --> 01:27:14,468
as an attorney,
to dress himself how he likes...

1268
01:27:15,703 --> 01:27:17,370
...as long as he doesn't
cause disorder

1269
01:27:17,404 --> 01:27:20,675
or interfere with
the functioning of the Court.

Thank you.

1276
01:27:33,688 --> 01:27:36,557
Mr. Dent,
call your next witness.

1277
01:27:40,561 --> 01:27:42,864
The State calls Gary Puddles.

1278
01:27:43,598 --> 01:27:44,966
Bailiff?

1279
01:27:44,999 --> 01:27:47,068
Will you please escort
Mr. Puddles to the stand?

1280
01:28:08,355 --> 01:28:09,356
Gary.

1281
01:28:12,727 --> 01:28:14,461
Go get 'em.

1282
01:28:41,122 --> 01:28:42,523
Please raise your right hand.

1283
01:28:45,126 --> 01:28:46,761
Do you solemnly swear
that the testimony

1284
01:28:46,794 --> 01:28:48,563
you're about to give
is the whole truth

1285
01:28:48,596 --> 01:28:51,065
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

1286
01:28:51,098 --> 01:28:52,365
I do.

1287
01:28:56,170 --> 01:28:57,738
Good morning, Mr. Puddles.

1288
01:28:57,772 --> 01:28:59,540
Thank you for being here.

1289
01:29:03,978 --> 01:29:05,680
So one last question, sir.

1290
01:29:05,713 --> 01:29:08,516
The person who you saw

1291
01:29:08,549 --> 01:29:10,718
stab Randall Kleinmanhoffer
to death,

1292
01:29:12,653 --> 01:29:14,387
are they in this courtroom
here today?

1293
01:29:14,421 --> 01:29:15,523
Yes.

1294
01:29:16,090 --> 01:29:17,925
Can you point him out
to all of us?

1295
01:29:18,458 --> 01:29:22,029
And... describe his clothing?

1296
01:29:23,931 --> 01:29:26,601
He's... He's sitting right there
at the table.

1297
01:29:27,168 --> 01:29:30,037
Wearing a red suit
and clown make-up.

1298
01:29:31,105 --> 01:29:32,907
May the record reflect

1299
01:29:32,940 --> 01:29:35,475
the identification
of the accused, Your Honor?

1300
01:29:35,977 --> 01:29:36,911
Yes, it will.

1301
01:29:38,045 --> 01:29:39,446
Nothing further, Your Honor.

1302
01:29:42,617 --> 01:29:44,384
Your witness, Mr. Fleck.

1303
01:29:53,027 --> 01:29:55,462
Mr. Puddles.

1304
01:29:57,231 --> 01:29:59,734
Gary Puddles?

1305
01:30:01,535 --> 01:30:04,906
Tell me, sir,
is that your God-given name?

1306
01:30:06,607 --> 01:30:07,474
Yes.

1307
01:30:08,009 --> 01:30:09,409
Really?

1308
01:30:09,977 --> 01:30:12,980
Really?
Your last name is Puddles?

1309
01:30:15,650 --> 01:30:19,452
Why, it sounds like a... a joke.

1310
01:30:20,054 --> 01:30:20,855
Well, it's not.

1311
01:30:22,990 --> 01:30:25,893
You expect us to believe
that your last name is Puddles?

1312
01:30:25,927 --> 01:30:27,228
Puddles?

1313
01:30:27,261 --> 01:30:30,131
Mr. Fleck, where is this going?

1314
01:30:30,164 --> 01:30:34,101
As I said, I'm not gonna let you
turn my courtroom into a circus.

1315
01:30:34,135 --> 01:30:35,670
Okay.

1316
01:30:35,703 --> 01:30:38,873
But, um, with all due respect,
Your Honor,

1317
01:30:38,906 --> 01:30:40,942
don't you think
it's a little late for that?

1318
01:30:41,175 --> 01:30:42,843
-Don't try my patience.
-Okay. Okay.

1319
01:30:45,846 --> 01:30:48,516
Mr. Puddles...

1320
01:30:49,250 --> 01:30:52,553
earlier this afternoon
you testified

1321
01:30:52,586 --> 01:30:55,790
that you saw me stab
Mr. Kliman Manhoff

1322
01:30:55,823 --> 01:30:59,060
in the neck a couple of times.
Correct?

1323
01:30:59,927 --> 01:31:00,861
Kleinmanhoffer.

1324
01:31:01,796 --> 01:31:03,998
Yes, I saw you.

1325
01:31:04,031 --> 01:31:05,633
Mm.

1326
01:31:05,666 --> 01:31:08,936
And what else
did you see that day?

1327
01:31:10,538 --> 01:31:13,541
You stabbing him in the eye,

1328
01:31:13,574 --> 01:31:16,010
and bashing his head
into the wall,

1329
01:31:16,043 --> 01:31:18,746
many, many times.

1330
01:31:19,213 --> 01:31:23,718
Yes, but, uh, Randall
was a bit of a bully, wasn't he?

1331
01:31:24,785 --> 01:31:26,821
He didn't deserve to die.

1332
01:31:28,889 --> 01:31:30,825
I don't know.

1333
01:31:30,858 --> 01:31:32,226
Eh, never mind.

1334
01:31:32,259 --> 01:31:35,129
Gary, did you catch my act

1335
01:31:35,162 --> 01:31:37,598
on <i>The Murray Franklin Show</i>
later that night?

1336
01:31:37,965 --> 01:31:39,266
No, I didn't.

1337
01:31:39,300 --> 01:31:40,167
No?

1338
01:31:41,202 --> 01:31:45,006
Might I remind you
that you are under oath?

1339
01:31:45,039 --> 01:31:47,041
I was locked up
at the police station.

1340
01:31:47,074 --> 01:31:48,743
In an interview room.

1341
01:31:49,710 --> 01:31:51,979
'Cause they thought
you might come and kill me.

1342
01:31:53,314 --> 01:31:54,749
I was the only witness.

1343
01:31:54,782 --> 01:31:56,650
They kept me in there all night.

1344
01:31:57,885 --> 01:32:01,055
Isn't that convenient,
Mr. Puddles?

1345
01:32:01,088 --> 01:32:04,025
That you didn't see the show,
you didn't see anything
I had to say,

1346
01:32:04,058 --> 01:32:05,593
I can't believe it!

1347
01:32:05,893 --> 01:32:06,894
Mr. Fleck.

1348
01:32:07,228 --> 01:32:08,796
Okay.

1349
01:32:10,664 --> 01:32:13,267
Uh, when you were
in my mama's apartment,

1350
01:32:13,300 --> 01:32:15,269
God rest her soul,

1351
01:32:15,302 --> 01:32:19,740
when, as you say, you saw me
bash Mr. Klannonmen--

1352
01:32:19,774 --> 01:32:24,311
whatever's-- head into the wall,
"many, many times,"

1353
01:32:26,047 --> 01:32:27,748
did I seem crazy to you?

1354
01:32:29,050 --> 01:32:32,887
Did I seem
like a different person?

1355
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:39,727
Or was I the same old Joker
that I always been?

1356
01:32:41,195 --> 01:32:44,665
Arthur, don't do this
to yourself, it isn't you.

1357
01:32:44,999 --> 01:32:48,636
It isn't me?
So you don't think this is me?

1358
01:32:48,669 --> 01:32:52,239
Well, maybe... maybe...
you don't know who I really was.

1359
01:32:55,109 --> 01:32:56,744
I never saw that side of you.

1360
01:32:56,777 --> 01:32:58,345
Well, maybe you weren't looking.

1361
01:32:59,146 --> 01:33:00,915
Maybe no one was.

1362
01:33:00,948 --> 01:33:04,852
Because nobody knew I existed.

1363
01:33:04,885 --> 01:33:07,354
But look around,
look at all these people.

1364
01:33:07,388 --> 01:33:11,092
Everyone outside. These cameras.

1365
01:33:11,125 --> 01:33:14,161
Who do you think they see,
Mr. Puddles?

1366
01:33:15,229 --> 01:33:17,031
Joker.

1367
01:33:19,834 --> 01:33:21,869
Oh, sweet child,

1368
01:33:22,937 --> 01:33:27,875
what you have proven here today,
is that you are no different

1369
01:33:27,908 --> 01:33:31,011
than any of those people
that underestimated me.

Gary, I like you.

1380
01:34:00,241 --> 01:34:02,943
I told you I wouldn't hurt you,
and I didn't.

1381
01:34:02,977 --> 01:34:04,345
Not hurt me?

1382
01:34:06,180 --> 01:34:08,149
I couldn't go back to work.

1383
01:34:09,016 --> 01:34:13,020
I still can't sleep,
and I'm scared all the time.

1384
01:34:14,155 --> 01:34:16,090
I never used to be scared.

1385
01:34:17,158 --> 01:34:20,895
I'm scared right now, here.
With you in front of me.

1386
01:34:23,164 --> 01:34:26,000
I couldn't do anything that day.

1387
01:34:26,867 --> 01:34:29,303
I felt so small.

1388
01:34:30,404 --> 01:34:33,674
I was reminded
how powerless I really am.

1389
01:34:35,376 --> 01:34:38,379
Oh... you got
a flair for the dramatic.

1390
01:34:38,412 --> 01:34:41,182
You are tugging at
my heart strings, little Gary.

1391
01:34:45,419 --> 01:34:47,288
No more-- no more questions,
Your Honor.

1392
01:34:48,355 --> 01:34:51,025
Do you know
what that feels like, Arthur?

1393
01:34:51,058 --> 01:34:52,826
Oh, fuck!

1394
01:34:52,860 --> 01:34:56,964
You were the only one at work
who never made fun of me.

1395
01:34:57,865 --> 01:35:00,234
You were the only one
that was nice to me.

1396
01:35:03,003 --> 01:35:06,006
I said, no more questions,
Your Honor!

1397
01:35:10,277 --> 01:35:12,346
Very well, Mr. Puddles.

1398
01:35:12,379 --> 01:35:14,281
The court thanks you
for your testimony.

1399

Please step down,
you're excused.

1400
01:35:33,133 --> 01:35:34,902
Mr. Dent,
call your next witness.

1401
01:35:37,572 --> 01:35:39,507
We're not calling
any more witnesses, Your Honor.

1402
01:35:40,441 --> 01:35:42,443
That is the State's case.

1403
01:35:42,476 --> 01:35:43,777
The State rests.

1404
01:35:44,478 --> 01:35:45,412
Very well.

1405
01:35:46,581 --> 01:35:48,315
All right, Mr. Fleck,

1406
01:35:48,349 --> 01:35:51,118
at this point,
you may mount your defense.

1407
01:35:54,488 --> 01:35:56,490
The defense rests as well,
Your Honor.

1408
01:35:58,058 --> 01:35:59,326
Pardon?

1409
01:36:00,261 --> 01:36:03,864
Mr. Fleck, you don't want
to put on any defense?

1410
01:36:03,897 --> 01:36:06,834
No, Your Honor.
The defense rests.

1411
01:36:07,167 --> 01:36:09,436
"Th-Th-Th-That's all folks."

1412
01:36:09,470 --> 01:36:11,505
All right, all right.

1413
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:14,108
All right.

1414
01:36:16,076 --> 01:36:18,279
<i>That's enough!</i>
<i>This is a court of law!</i>

1415
01:36:21,081 --> 01:36:23,217
<i>With both sides having rested,</i>

1416
01:36:24,184 --> 01:36:28,255
<i>this court will recess</i>
<i>until tomorrow morning at 9:30.</i>

1417
01:36:28,289 --> 01:36:31,025
You made our case
for us, you fucking idiot!

1418
01:36:31,058 --> 01:36:32,459
You're gonna fry
for killing my son!

1419
01:36:32,493 --> 01:36:33,595
Burn in hell!

1420
01:36:33,628 --> 01:36:35,029
Anything you want to say?

1421
01:36:35,062 --> 01:36:36,130
Arthur, will you be convicted?

1422
01:36:36,163 --> 01:36:37,231
Arthur, over here.

1423
01:36:37,264 --> 01:36:38,365
Let's see that smile.

1424
01:36:38,399 --> 01:36:40,067
Where do you think you stand,
Arthur?

1425
01:36:44,872 --> 01:36:46,508
What are you
gonna do if they let you off?

I'm only working
four of these days.

01:41:16,544 --> 01:41:17,579
What?

1492
01:41:18,646 --> 01:41:19,781
Move.

1493
01:41:19,814 --> 01:41:21,148
Easy, darling.

1494
01:41:26,621 --> 01:41:29,389
Why is everyone
so upset with me?

1495
01:41:29,423 --> 01:41:30,658
Move your ass.

1496
01:41:32,225 --> 01:41:33,360
Come on, Arthur.

1497
01:41:35,462 --> 01:41:37,397
I'm an attorney now!

1498
01:41:37,431 --> 01:41:39,466
-I will see you in court.
-Shut the fuck up.

1499
01:41:39,499 --> 01:41:41,134
And I'm the fucking
Queen of Sheba.

1500
01:41:41,168 --> 01:41:42,570
I'm gonna fucking murder you.

1501
01:41:45,339 --> 01:41:46,173
Yeah?

1502
01:41:47,274 --> 01:41:48,375

1503
01:41:48,843 --> 01:41:49,844

1505
01:41:54,515 --> 01:41:57,284
Had to go and be
a big shot on TV.

1506
01:41:57,317 --> 01:41:58,586
I think he knocked himself out.

1507
01:42:01,956 --> 01:42:03,290
Motherfucker.

1508
01:42:05,960 --> 01:42:06,794
Stand him up.

1509
01:42:11,331 --> 01:42:14,501
All right, I get it.
I get it, Jackie.

1510
01:42:14,802 --> 01:42:16,771
You wanna--
You wanna hear a joke, right?

1511
01:42:16,804 --> 01:42:18,573
You really think...

1512
01:42:18,606 --> 01:42:20,340
...fancy red suit

1513
01:42:20,374 --> 01:42:22,677
and muck on your face
makes you better than us?

1514
01:42:23,343 --> 01:42:26,313
You have no fucking idea
what it takes,

1515
01:42:26,346 --> 01:42:29,449
put a little bit of joy
into this fucking place.

1516
01:42:29,483 --> 01:42:32,185
Let me tell you one I used to do
about my mother.

1517
01:42:32,219 --> 01:42:33,521
You can drop the act now.

1518
01:42:33,554 --> 01:42:34,789
-My mother was...
-Because we know

1519
01:42:34,822 --> 01:42:36,824
it's only Arthur in there, okay?

1520
01:42:36,858 --> 01:42:39,393
And she only dated abusive guys.

1521
01:42:39,426 --> 01:42:40,460
Yeah, is that right?

1522
01:42:40,494 --> 01:42:42,697
And, I asked her, I said,

1523
01:42:42,730 --> 01:42:46,734
"Mom, why do you stay
with your abusive boyfriend?"

1524
01:42:47,334 --> 01:42:48,736
And she said...

1525
01:42:48,770 --> 01:42:50,370
"Beats the hell out of me."

1526
01:42:51,839 --> 01:42:53,206
I told you to drop it.

1527
01:42:54,742 --> 01:42:56,243
Oh, he liked it!

1528
01:43:02,482 --> 01:43:04,317
Oh, Jackie...

1529
01:43:04,351 --> 01:43:05,953
aren't you gonna
buy me a drink first?

1530
01:43:08,255 --> 01:43:09,924
Let's go, let's go.

1531
01:43:09,957 --> 01:43:11,793
-Let's fucking go!
-No!

1532
01:43:14,696 --> 01:43:17,632

-No!

1533
01:43:18,365 --> 01:43:20,902

01:59:59,667 --> 02:00:00,835
Is he all right?

1723
02:00:02,837 --> 02:00:05,640
Fuck. Fucking A.
Can you cut around it?

1724
02:00:05,673 --> 02:00:07,809
No, chill out,
it's red. It's okay.

1725
02:00:07,842 --> 02:00:09,944
-Fuck!
-Calm down, man.

1726
02:00:12,613 --> 02:00:14,481
This is just
the beginning, man.

1727
02:00:14,515 --> 02:00:17,819
They're gonna burn
the whole fucking city down now.

1728
02:00:22,724 --> 02:00:25,693
No, no. Wait.
Wait, don't do this, man.

1729
02:00:26,293 --> 02:00:28,328
Come on, man.
Get back inside.

1730
02:00:28,361 --> 02:00:29,530
Get in. Get in.

1731
02:00:33,801 --> 02:00:37,471
-Hey, hey, hey!
-Come back!

1732
02:00:38,305 --> 02:00:40,541
Come back, man. Joker.

1733
02:00:43,310 --> 02:00:44,879
Fuck.

1734
02:00:44,912 --> 02:00:46,379
No!

1735
02:00:46,413 --> 02:00:47,715
Where are you going, man?

1736
02:00:48,348 --> 02:00:49,517
We still love you.

1737
02:00:49,984 --> 02:00:51,519
We love you, Joker.

1738
02:00:51,819 --> 02:00:52,987
Joker!

1739
02:00:56,591 --> 02:00:57,992
Joker!

1740
02:01:30,423 --> 02:01:31,526
Lee?

1741
02:01:36,429 --> 02:01:37,364
Lee!

1742
02:02:03,024 --> 02:02:04,592
Look at you.

1743
02:02:07,628 --> 02:02:08,729
You cut your hair.

1744
02:02:16,971 --> 02:02:20,373
Someone blew up the courthouse,
and I'm free.

1745
02:02:23,578 --> 02:02:24,946
We can go away.

1746
02:02:31,586 --> 02:02:33,020
Lee, you hear me?

1747
02:02:33,888 --> 02:02:35,957
Someone blew up the courthouse.

1748
02:02:35,990 --> 02:02:36,958
We can go.

1749
02:02:39,193 --> 02:02:40,460
I escaped.

1750
02:02:42,797 --> 02:02:44,599
We're not going away, Arthur.

1751
02:02:46,834 --> 02:02:49,904
All we had was the fantasy,
and you gave up.

1752
02:02:52,874 --> 02:02:54,508
We were never going anywhere.

1753
02:03:01,515 --> 02:03:03,150
I'm that same guy
you fell in love with.

1754
02:03:05,452 --> 02:03:08,155
I'm the same guy
that murdered Murray Franklin.

1755
02:03:09,223 --> 02:03:10,390
No.

1756
02:03:11,859 --> 02:03:12,927
No, you're not.

1757
02:03:14,494 --> 02:03:16,063
There is no Joker.

1758
02:03:17,131 --> 02:03:18,699
That's what you said, isn't it?

1759
02:03:26,874 --> 02:03:28,709
I can't--

1760
02:03:29,210 --> 02:03:31,545
I can't--
I can't live without you.

1761
02:03:35,016 --> 02:03:37,685
Please. We're having a baby.

02:05:53,687 --> 02:05:55,322
No fucking cigarettes left.

1786
02:06:10,905 --> 02:06:12,139
Let's go.

1787
02:06:18,312 --> 02:06:20,081
Hey, Arthur. Hold up.

1788
02:06:23,117 --> 02:06:24,718
Can I tell you a joke
I came up with?

1789
02:06:25,286 --> 02:06:26,821
Um...

1790
02:06:26,854 --> 02:06:28,189
Is it quick?

1791
02:06:28,222 --> 02:06:29,657
Yeah, I can make it quick.

Okay.

1793
02:06:32,059 --> 02:06:34,862
So, a psychopath walks
into a bar,

1794
02:06:34,895 --> 02:06:37,698
and sees this famous clown
sitting there all alone.

1795
02:06:38,065 --> 02:06:39,767
Totally drunk, it's pathetic.

1796
02:06:40,668 --> 02:06:42,837
"I can't believe you're here,"
he says.

1797
02:06:43,237 --> 02:06:48,008
"What a disappointment.
I used to watch you on TV.

1798
02:06:49,410 --> 02:06:51,245
What can I get you?"

1799
02:06:51,278 --> 02:06:53,714
And this clown turns and says,

1800
02:06:54,782 --> 02:06:57,751
"Well, if you're buying
you can get me anything."

1801
02:07:00,121 --> 02:07:02,656
"Perfect," the psychopath says.

1802
02:07:02,690 --> 02:07:04,825
"How about I get you
what you fucking deserve?"

1803
02:07:33,420 --> 02:07:36,323
