00:00:01,401 --> 00:00:03,103
My name is Barry Allen,

3
00:00:03,104 --> 00:00:05,938
and I am the fastest man alive.

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,007
When I was a child,
I saw my mother killed

5
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:09,975
- by something impossible.
- <i>Run, Barry, run!</i>

6
00:00:09,977 --> 00:00:12,978
My father went to prison
for her murder.

7
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:17,116
Then an accident made me
the impossible.

8
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:19,651
To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist,

9
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:22,621
but secretly, I use my speed
to fight crime

10
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:24,623
and find others like me.

11
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,825
And one day, I'll find
who killed my mother...

12
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:29,495
- Mom!
- And get justice for my father.

13
00:00:29,497 --> 00:00:32,531
I am The Flash.

14
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:34,299
Previously on<i> The Flash...</i>

15
00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:37,002
You opened your lab after
Nora Allen's murder.

16
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:38,604
Do you mind telling me what
you were doing

17
00:00:38,606 --> 00:00:39,872
in Central City before that?

18
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:41,440
Here I thought we were
just two guys

19
00:00:41,442 --> 00:00:44,376
having a friendly drink.

20
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:45,878
What?

21
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,279
I just noticed you don't
smile too much.

22
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:49,014
The explosion that put you
in a coma

23
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:51,183
also killed my fiancée.

24
00:00:51,185 --> 00:00:52,151
Ronnie!

25
00:00:52,153 --> 00:00:53,452
He was a hero.

26
00:00:53,454 --> 00:00:54,953
I didn't want him to be
a hero.

27
00:00:54,955 --> 00:00:57,756
I wanted him to be my husband.

28
00:00:57,758 --> 00:00:59,992
Don't look for me again.

29
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,497
Everyone has a hero,

30
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:07,566
someone they look up to
or admire,

31
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:11,870
someone they just wish
they could be.

32
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:13,939
It's easy to believe in heroes.

33
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:17,042
What's hard is when our heroes
stop believing in us.

34
00:01:17,044 --> 00:01:19,845
Oh, Barry, there's an
intersection coming up. Hurry!

35
00:01:19,847 --> 00:01:22,047
This should slow 'em down.

36
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:31,323
Guys, which way?

37
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:32,357
- Left.
- Right.

38
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:33,425
- Right.
- Left.

39
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:34,726
Stop! You both hear you're

40
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:36,095
telling me two different things,
right?

41
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:38,163
Barry, listen up.
Listen carefully.

42
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:39,698
Here is what you're going to do.

43
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,700
Now, the Queen is trying to make
it to the bridge,

44
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:43,235
but I have a shortcut...
wait for it...

45
00:01:43,237 --> 00:01:45,938
And left... left...

46
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,406
right...
I see her!

47
00:01:47,408 --> 00:01:48,874
Make her go west
before Fremont.

48
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:50,576
- Okay, how?
- I'd recommend a detour.

49
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:58,851
Now, the King is headed for
the entrance to the interstate.

50
00:01:58,853 --> 00:02:00,719
What entrance?

51
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:02,855
Atta boy.

52
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:07,726
Check...

53
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:10,896
Got the keys.

54
00:02:10,898 --> 00:02:12,331
Mate.

55
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,503
Give me some!

56
00:02:17,505 --> 00:02:18,570
Yeah!

57
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:21,106
Efficiently done, Mr. Allen.

58
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:23,642
- We need a picture.
- Pretty sure rule number one

59
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:26,278
of having a secret identity is
not taking pictures of yourself

60
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,746
in your super suit
without a mask on.

61
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:29,515
Oh, come on, please!

62
00:02:29,517 --> 00:02:31,850
This is just for us.
This is to document all this.

63
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:33,385
Who knows? Maybe people
in the future

64
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:35,220
will want to know how
all this happened.

65
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:36,755
All right, well, if you want
the future to have

66
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:39,424
the whole story, then,
we all need to be in it.

67
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:41,226
First, let me put on
some makeup?

68
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:42,561
The future does not care
about your makeup.

69
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:44,596
Mm-mmm.

70
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:46,298
Okay.

71
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,733
Big smiles.

72
00:02:47,735 --> 00:02:50,502
Three... two... one.

73
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:54,306
Ha!
Does that count as a selfie?

74
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:55,908
Absolutely.

75
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:58,677
Sick.
Came out good.

76
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:01,013
Thanks for talking me through
things out there.

77
00:03:01,015 --> 00:03:02,181
My pleasure.

78
00:03:02,183 --> 00:03:03,849
Well done.

79
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:06,118
I have to say it was a bit
of a rush feeling like a...

80
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,453
- A hero.
- Yeah.

81
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:10,422
You're pretty good at it.

82
00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:17,996
- Hey.
- Hey.

83
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:20,465
You do realize the whole point
of moving out is

84
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:22,034
not being at home anymore,
right?

85
00:03:22,036 --> 00:03:23,735
Ha-ha-ha.

86
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:25,804
I forgot a few things.

87
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:28,507
So... how is it living back
at the house?

88
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:30,876
- Hey, Bar?
- Yo.

89
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:33,712
Babe...
spaghetti a la me.

90
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:34,980
You sure you don't want
to stay for dinner?

91
00:03:34,982 --> 00:03:37,516
Thanks, but Eddie is painting
all day

92
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:39,384
and I swore that I would help.

93
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:40,552
Although, I'm really just going
to do that thing

94
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:41,620
where I get a little paint

95
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:42,621
on my hair and on my nose.

96
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:44,323
Oh, hey,

97
00:03:44,325 --> 00:03:47,192
someone from Central City
Picture News called you

98
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:48,860
the other day... I left the number
on the fridge.

99
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:50,028
What?
Why didn't you tell me?

100
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,797
Chill! Just did.

101
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:56,668
Hey, I heard that some members
of the Royal Flush Gang

102
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,971
are headed to prison.

103
00:03:58,973 --> 00:04:01,139
Is that a good scream or
a bad scream?

104
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:02,908
Good! So good!

105
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,110
I just got offered a job
as a reporter

106
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:07,112
at Central City Picture News.

107
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:09,448
- That's awesome!
- The editor's a fan of my blog!

108
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:12,718
- That is amazing.
- Oh, my God!

109
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,052
Oh, God.

Harrison Wells.

112
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,374
Hello?

113
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:12,044
We both know what you did.

114
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:25,791
It's time to pay the piper!

115
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:53,218
Come in.

116
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:59,324
Look, Joe, I apologize
for all of this.

117
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:02,327
It just... it really feels like a
case of so much for so little.

118
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:04,396
The police should not have
been called.

119
00:06:04,398 --> 00:06:07,232
I got a prank call before
all this happened.

120
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:10,369
This feels like more than just
a prank, Doctor.

121
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:14,206
Well, there are those who feel
I did not suffer enough

122
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,341
for the particle accelerator
explosion of last year,

123
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:18,944
and some of them act on it.

124

Dr. Wells.
Dr. Wells, are you okay?

125
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,617
Dr. Snow, I'm... I'm fine.
A little chilly.

126
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:27,419
Otherwise, I'm fine.
Hello, Cisco.

127
00:06:27,421 --> 00:06:29,087
Make yourselves at home
as best you can.

128
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:31,890
I'm gonna make
a hotel reservation.

129
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:36,428
Oh...
This place is so sick.

130
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:39,231
Yeah... hey, what took you guys
so long?

131
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:40,732
We got lost.

132
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,868
We've never been here before.

133
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,369
Really? Never?

134

He tends to keep his
private life private.

135

A precipice in front,
and wolves behind.

136
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,385
In other words, you're between
a rock and a hard place.

137
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:03,755
Check.

138
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:08,293
The King is dead.

139
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:09,895
Checkmate.

140
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,634
Dr. Wells?

141
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:18,670
There he is.

142
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:23,074
Hartley, allow me to introduce
you to Cisco Ramon.

143
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:25,744
Mr. Ramon here is one of the
finest mechanical engineers

144
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:27,612
I have ever seen.

145
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,314
Wow.

146
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:31,249
I can't believe Harrison Wells
said that about me.

147
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:33,351
I'm sure he'll prove to be an
invaluable member of your team.

148
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:35,654
- Trust me.
- You I trust.

149
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:37,889
I don't foresee myself
trusting someone

150
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:39,257
who showed up to his first day
of work

151
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:41,092
at a billion dollar
research facility

152
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:43,128
wearing a T-shirt that says

153
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,965
"Keep Calm and Han Shot First."

154
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,768
Huh... would you give us
a minute please, Cisco?

155
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:52,170
Yes, sir.

156
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:58,143
I realize you don't have to
explain your hiring decisions

157
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:01,646
to me, but maybe for the sake
of a fun exercise,

158
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,748
we could pretend you did.

159
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,051
I have a good feeling
about him.

160
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:07,652
Just as I did about you.

161
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,121
Oh...

162
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:11,590
Hartley...

163
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,161
You're still my guy.

164
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:21,233
And nothing and no one is ever
going to change that.

165
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:26,505
I canvassed the street.

166
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:28,673
No other reports of vandalism.

167
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,376
No strange cars.

168
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:34,813
Get this... Wells says he's right
there when it happened.

169
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:38,550
All that glass shattering down
around him and he can't walk?

170
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:41,086
And he didn't have a scratch
on him.

171
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:06,144
There's no point of impact.

172
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:09,781
No rock or bat or...
any solid object

173
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:11,383
went through these windows.

174
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:14,853
It's as if they just
shattered themselves.

175
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:19,958
This wasn't some teenage prank?

176
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,094
No, it wasn't.

177
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:24,729
But you don't want our help.

178
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:27,032
Why?

179
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:30,802
Because I already know
who did this.

180
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:33,805
Hartley Rathaway.

181
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:36,808
Who is Hartley Rathaway?

182
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,611
Hartley Rathaway is
the prodigal son.

183
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:42,447
And he has returned.

184
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:50,755
Hartley Rathaway possesses one
of the finest scientific minds

185
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,557
I've ever encountered.

186
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,392
Any ties to
Rathaway Industries?

187
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:56,761
His grandfather founded the
company, his father expanded it,

188
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,930
and Hartley here was set
to inherit the throne.

189
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:01,733
- What happened?
- He came out to his parents.

190
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:03,468
Old money, old values.

191
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,136
They were estranged
when we met,

192
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:07,105
but, brilliant.
I couldn't have built

193
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,640
the particle accelerator
without him.

194
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:11,109
You guys have never even
mentioned his name.

195
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:14,613
That's because Hartley had
a challenging personality.

196
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:17,782
What she means is he was
mostly a jerk.

197
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,485
But, every once in a while,

198
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:21,720
he could be a dick.

199
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:25,590
Let's just say that Hartley,
like many outliers,

200
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:27,292
had trouble relating to
his peers.

201
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:29,894
Yes, but he was always
your favorite.

202
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:32,297
The chosen one.

203
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,032
He referred to himself
like that.

204
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:38,603
So if you two were so close,
why would he target you?

205
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:40,071
Hartley left S.T.A.R. Labs
about a year ago

206
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:42,707
after we had a...

207
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:44,576
a disagreement.

208
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:48,446
About what?

209
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:50,715
Look, don't worry.
We'll stop him.

210
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:53,885
I won't let him hurt you...
any of you.

211
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:56,955
Let's get back to my lab,
all right?

212
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:05,163
I could've gone my whole life
without seeing that jerk again.

213
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:11,703
Yo. This place is so dope.

214
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:13,772
What a coincidence.
We were thinking of making

215
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:17,008
"Yo. This place is so dope"
our new slogan.

216
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,943
If you're so convinced
Dr. Wells made a mistake

217
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:23,048
in hiring me, why don't you try
proving it to him?

218
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,650
Magnetic flux is measured
by what?

219
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:27,185
Hall effect pick up.

220
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,521
The dual of a parallel
R-C circuit?

221
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:32,357
Series R-L circuit.
I can go all day, pal.

222
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,529
Hartley, it looks like you
have met your match.

223
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:40,198
I am Dr. Caitlin Snow.
It's very nice to meet you.

224
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,800
Cisco Ramon.
Nice to meet you.

225
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:44,436
And just ignore Hartley.
We all do.

226
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:46,438
Tell your boyfriend I need his
specs on the synchrotron

227
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,972
by end of day.

228
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:50,975
Actually, it is the end of
Ronnie's day.

229
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:52,377
We are leaving early.

230
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,978
My boyfriend is taking me
out of town

231
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,880
for our one-year anniversary.

232
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,016
- Aw. That's sweet.
- Thanks.

233
00:11:58,018 --> 00:11:59,484
I'll see you guys on Monday.

234
00:11:59,486 --> 00:12:01,519
See ya.

235
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:05,590
She seems nice.

236
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:07,325
You don't.

237
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:09,060
I give you a week.

238
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,429
Max.

239
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:27,112
Hi. I'm Iris West.
It's my first day.

240
00:12:27,114 --> 00:12:28,747
I can see that.

241
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:30,515
Really? Does it show?

242
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:32,350
Uh, the fact that I've never
seen you before shows.

243
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:34,619
Mr. Bridge! Nice of you to
make an appearance

244
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:36,654
at a staff meeting.

245
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:39,023
I do love a good shmear.

246
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:42,527
Everyone, welcome Iris West,
our new cub.

247
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:45,663
Anyone want to volunteer to be
her mama bear?

248
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:49,834
Mason, you picked a bad day
to actually show up.

249
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:52,170
- I don't nanny.
- I lost the ability

250
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:54,506
to make a joke back in '05.
Today, you do.

251
00:12:54,508 --> 00:12:57,375
Deadlines. All new stories
are due on my desk

252
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:58,877
at the end of the day.

253
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:01,579
Oh, actually, I had an idea
for a piece.

254
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:03,414
There's this program in Keystone

255
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,350
that helps battered women get
back on their feet.

256
00:13:05,352 --> 00:13:08,620
Ah, that sounds really great,
West.

257
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:10,922
Actually, any thoughts on
a piece about The Flash,

258
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:14,893
something you haven't written
about yet, something new?

259
00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:16,795
Um, no.

260
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:20,098
Not currently.

261
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,833
All right.
Sally forth, everyone.

262
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:23,535
Sally forth.

263
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,571
Everything has
a natural frequency.

264
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:28,273
And since sound is expressed

265
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:30,108
as a vibration, if the pitch
of the sound

266
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,610
matches the natural vibration
frequency of an object, then...

267
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:40,585
So, you're saying that can
happen to anything,

268
00:13:40,587 --> 00:13:42,287
- not just glass?
- Oh, yeah.

269
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:44,589
I think that's absolutely what
happened to the windows

270
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:46,057
at Wells' house.

271
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:49,627
He's using some kind of
sonic technology.

272
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:53,631
I'm getting this feeling that
Wells is hiding something...

273
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:55,767
about what's going on with
this Rathaway character...

274
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:57,669
Don't touch that!

275
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:01,506
I mean, it sounds like this
Hartley guy was a pill

276
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,374
before he went all
super villain, so I...

277
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:05,176
I get why he never
mentioned him.

278
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:08,313
Like he never mentions his
girlfriend that got killed.

279
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:09,747
No.

280
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:11,649
How do you know about her?

281
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:13,751
He's taking up a big part
of our lives.

282
00:14:13,753 --> 00:14:15,420
I wanted to know more about him.

283
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:17,455
I mean, if you want to know
more about him,

284
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:19,357
you could just ask me.

285
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:24,229
Sounds like you don't know him
as well as you think.

286
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:27,031
Joe. Multiple 911 calls.

287
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,234
Rathaway Industries
is under attack.

288
00:14:29,236 --> 00:14:30,902
Sector cars are en route.

289
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,740
- Hey.
- Barry, it's Caitlin.

290
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:38,042
I think I know why
you're calling.

291
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,194
Get down on the ground!

292
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:03,902
It's over, Rathaway.

293
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:06,137
You know my name.

294
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:08,373
I know some names too.

295
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,874
Caitlin Snow.

296
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:11,709
Cisco Ramon.

297
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:14,312
Harrison Wells.

298
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:16,981
I can hear the radio waves
emanating from your suit.

299
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:18,549
About 1900 megahertz.

300
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:21,052
Is that them on the other end,
listening?

301
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:23,554
Are they gonna hear you die?

302
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:26,190
No. They're going to hear you
get your ass kicked.

303
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:27,759
Okay.

304
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,277
Looks like you're not as smart
as everyone says.

305
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,445
Smart enough to have
figured out

306
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,280
who Harrison Wells really is.

307
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:52,450
You see, I know his secret.

308
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,529
Being scooped up by a guy clad
in head-to-toe leather

309
00:16:04,531 --> 00:16:08,132
is a long-time fantasy of mine,
so thanks.

310
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:11,102
Well, well, well,
the gang's all here.

311
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:13,805
You've lasted a lot longer than
I would've thought, Cisco.

312
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:16,607
And you didn't last
ten seconds against The Flash.

313
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:18,876
I was thinking of calling
myself Pied Piper.

314
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:22,680
Hey! I assign the nicknames
around here.

315
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:25,550
Although that one's not bad.

316
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:27,151
Caitlin...

317
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,886
Never did get
that wedding invite.

318
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:30,421
Shut the hell up!

319
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:33,491
Stay in front of me.

320
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:43,701
The scanner is detecting foreign
metallic objects in your ears.

321
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:45,303
- Take 'em out.
- I can't.

322
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:47,005
I suffered head trauma when
S.T.A.R. Labs exploded.

323
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:48,940
My hearing was severely damaged.

324
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:50,908
Without these, I'm in pain
you can't imagine.

325
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:55,613
We all lost something
that night.

326
00:16:57,449 --> 00:17:01,285
Ha. Very clever re-purposing
the anti-proton cavities

327
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:02,854
into confinement cells.

328
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:04,756
Wells' idea, I'm sure.

329
00:17:04,758 --> 00:17:06,424
It was mine, actually.

330
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:18,102
Hartley, don't make this more
difficult than it has to be.

331
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:25,009
Enough, Hartley.

332
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:29,781
Give us a minute.

333
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,684
See you soon, Cisco.

334
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:35,086
Doubt it!

335
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:48,166
God, I wish I'd taken
a language in high school.

336
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:50,501
How did you know we were
working with The Flash?

337
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:52,703
I wrote a hexagonal algorithm

338
00:17:52,705 --> 00:17:54,105
tracking all of his sightings,

339
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:56,941
extrapolating a theoretical
exit trajectory.

340
00:17:56,943 --> 00:18:01,279
In other words, every time he
ran from the scene of a crime,

341
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:04,315
he ran in this general
direction.

342
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:07,251
You are brilliant.

343
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:11,722
And... any anguish you have been
through because of me

344
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:15,493
was never my intent.

345
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:16,928
Not bad...

346
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:20,398
as far as
heartfelt apologies go.

347
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,568
Except that wasn't for
my benefit.

348
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:26,104
That was for you, Flash.

349
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:29,006
Feels good to have the great
Harrison Wells behind you,

350
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:31,409
doesn't it?
But one day,

351
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:35,346
this man will turn on you...

352
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:37,181
in a flash...

353
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,317
and even you won't
see it coming.

354
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:42,453
I only hope that he leaves you
in better shape than he left me.

355
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:45,623
If you're lucky,
you'll only be dead.

356
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:49,260
Because every day I have to live
with the agonizing,

357
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:51,896
piercing screaming in my ears.

358
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,735
I almost forgot...
I told your pet

359
00:18:57,737 --> 00:19:01,305
I know your deep, dark secret,
Harrison.

360
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:04,542
Have fun letting him in
on that one.

361
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:12,016
I assume you were all
listening.

362
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:15,686
Well, Hartley was telling
the truth.

363
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:18,322
I have not been honest with you.

364
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,057
With any of you.

365
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:30,034
The accelerator...

366
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:32,136
Hartley warned me that there was
indeed a chance

367
00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:35,139
that the accelerator
could explode.

368
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:40,845
His data did not show
100% certainty,

369
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:43,247
just that there was a risk,
but it was a real risk.

370
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:46,918
And yet I made the decision

371
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:52,890
that the reward... that...

372
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:56,561
everything we could learn and
everything we could achieve,

373
00:19:56,563 --> 00:19:59,030
that all of that...

374
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,403
simply outweighed that risk.

375
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:07,638
I'm sorry.

376
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:13,477
Then the next time you choose
to put our lives,

377
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:16,247
and the lives of the people
that we love,

378
00:20:16,249 --> 00:20:18,649
at risk,

379
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:21,719
I'll expect a heads up.

380
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:36,500
After the explosion,
when everyone else left you...

381
00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:41,239
Caitlin and Cisco stood by you.

382
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:43,708
You owe them more than
an apology.

383
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,510
They might soon get more
than that what with Hartley

384
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:49,347
so intent on sending me
to the next world.

385
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:51,048
What are...

386
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:54,118
that wouldn't make it right
with them.

387
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,890
You broke their trust.
Our trust.

388
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,142
Oh! Hi, chief.

389
00:21:18,144 --> 00:21:20,778
- Is that what people call you?
- Uh, no. Not really.

390
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,447
Listen, eyewitnesses say that
The Flash thwarted an attack

391
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:26,083
downtown today.
Look into it.

392
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:28,286
- Uh, yeah, sure.
- Great.

393
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:30,554
Mason, you're looking
particularly rumpled today.

394
00:21:30,556 --> 00:21:31,789
Mm-hmm.

395
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:36,127
So, what are we working on?

396
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:40,097
I am following up on a lead
on corruption at the DWP.

397
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:43,200
You... well, I think you just got
your assignment from Larkin,

398
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:45,636
didn't you?

399
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,204
Look, I'm not stupid, okay?

400
00:21:47,206 --> 00:21:48,706
I know that Larkin hired me
because he thinks

401
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,142
that I have some sort of in
with The Flash.

402
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:53,144
But I am serious about
being a journalist.

403
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:56,213
Why? Because you write a blog?

404
00:21:56,215 --> 00:21:59,917
My mother writes a blog.

405
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,286
I may not have a lot of
experience, but I do have...

406
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:05,489
Spunk? Grit?

407
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:07,291
Gumption?

408
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:09,427
What is this,
a Chick-Lit novel?

409
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:21,339
No, no, no, I am having
the worst day ever.

410
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:24,542
We both can't be having
the worst day ever. Okay?

411
00:22:24,544 --> 00:22:26,110
And I was really looking forward
to getting

412
00:22:26,112 --> 00:22:27,678
some good complaining in.

413
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,480
Well, fire away.

414
00:22:29,482 --> 00:22:32,683
Okay, well, turns out that
the real reason they hired me

415
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,685
is because they think I have
some sort of connection

416
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:37,154
to The Flash, which I don't.

417
00:22:37,156 --> 00:22:38,856
Not anymore.

418
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,925
And I've been teamed up with
Mason Bridge,

419
00:22:40,927 --> 00:22:44,695
who is a legend, who I admired,
before he told me

420
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:47,698
I was a worthless,
talentless millennial.

421
00:22:52,337 --> 00:22:54,705
Well, the people we admire
aren't always

422
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:57,341
who we'd like them to be.

423
00:22:57,343 --> 00:22:58,843
Well said.

424
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:03,214
So, I'm screwed.

425
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:05,683
No, look...

426
00:23:05,685 --> 00:23:09,520
if this Mason guy doesn't see
what a talented journalist

427
00:23:09,522 --> 00:23:11,489
you are, then he's probably
a lousy writer.

428
00:23:11,491 --> 00:23:13,891
He won the Pulitzer.

429
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:16,360
Twice, I think.

430
00:23:16,362 --> 00:23:18,262
Oh. Good for him.

431
00:23:21,534 --> 00:23:23,167
Thanks, Barry.

432
00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:26,737
Having someone believe in me,
it's, um...

433
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:29,807
a small... really,
really big thing.

434
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:34,512
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

435
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:43,087
Where's Dr. Wells?

436
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:46,257
I'm not sure.
Barry was right.

437
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:47,892
Hartley was using sonic
resonance.

438
00:23:47,894 --> 00:23:50,227
The intensity regulator's
measuring decibels.

439
00:23:50,229 --> 00:23:51,562
But you know what's weird?

440
00:23:51,564 --> 00:23:54,198
He had it set to
the lowest setting.

441
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,033
- What do you mean?
- Well...

442
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:58,269
He could've completely destroyed
his father's building

443
00:23:58,271 --> 00:24:00,104
if he wanted to in one blast.

444
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:02,339
So, why not just do it
and leave?

445
00:24:02,341 --> 00:24:07,011
I mean, why stick around and run
the risk of getting caught?

446
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:09,146
Unless he wanted to be caught.

447
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,354
Dr. Wells!

448
00:24:17,356 --> 00:24:19,123
There's been a pipeline breach.

449
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:20,991
Hartley.

450
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:24,795
Stay here.

451
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:38,476
Ah! Not now.

452
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:43,247
Aah!

453
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:21,485
Cisco, can you hear me?

454
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,193
Ugh!

455
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,863
- Hey, what's up?
- Listen to me... Hartley escaped.

456
00:26:05,865 --> 00:26:08,499
- He's loose in the facility.
- Okay.

457
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:14,471
Okay, your turn... why are you
having the worst day...

458
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:26,784
Tell me, Harrison.

459
00:26:26,786 --> 00:26:28,786
Am I still your guy?

460
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,457
Hey! Are you okay?

461
00:26:33,459 --> 00:26:36,594
Yeah, uh, Cisco and Dr. Wells.

462
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,265
He's gone.

463
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,938
Hey.

464
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:51,542
Welcome back, Mr. Ramon.

465
00:26:51,544 --> 00:26:52,643
Ooh.

466
00:26:52,645 --> 00:26:55,479
Oh, man.

467
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:57,581
- Caitlin?
- Hey.

468
00:26:57,583 --> 00:26:59,049
She's fine.

469
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:01,051
You need to rest.
You have a concussion.

470
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:03,354
You're lucky.

471
00:27:03,356 --> 00:27:05,189
Please tell me you got him.

472
00:27:05,191 --> 00:27:08,325
I guess the attack on his
family's company was a fake out

473
00:27:08,327 --> 00:27:09,693
- so we'd catch him.
- And give him...

474
00:27:09,695 --> 00:27:11,862
- direct access to S.T.A.R. Labs.
- Why?

475
00:27:11,864 --> 00:27:13,931
I should've known he was
up to something.

476
00:27:13,933 --> 00:27:15,165
This is my fault.

477
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:16,967
Hey, man.
This is on me, too.

478
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:18,302
I shouldn't have left before...

479
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:20,471
This is no one's fault
but mine.

480
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:23,474
I earned the blame... I'm not
interested in sharing it.

481
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:27,177
Hartley doesn't think I've paid
for my crimes.

482
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:28,545
And he's right.

483
00:27:28,547 --> 00:27:30,614
He won't stop until I do.

484
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:34,852
Where are you going?

485
00:27:34,854 --> 00:27:36,887
To earn back your trust.

486
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:47,765
Hmm... now what were you doing
in my accelerator?

487
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:50,968
Thought it was
our accelerator.

488
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:54,038
Because it will be our fault
if we turn this thing on

489
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,440
and blow a hole in Central City.

490
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:02,446
You are wagering the lives
of everyone in this building.

491
00:28:02,448 --> 00:28:04,348
Everyone in this city.

492
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,949
If you don't have the courage
to admit you could be wrong,

493
00:28:05,951 --> 00:28:08,519
I will do it for you.

494
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:10,320
Hartley Rathaway...

495
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:15,592
your position at S.T.A.R. Labs
is terminated.

496
00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:18,062
If you think you can
shut me up...

497
00:28:18,064 --> 00:28:19,563
Oh, I know I can, Hartley.

498
00:28:19,565 --> 00:28:22,399
Because if you breathe one word
of any kind of

499
00:28:22,401 --> 00:28:24,234
unsubstantiated accusation,

500
00:28:24,236 --> 00:28:26,570
I will make sure the only job
you ever get in physics

501
00:28:26,572 --> 00:28:30,641
is teaching it to
high school juniors.

502
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:47,758
What is going on here?

503
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,294
Press conference.

504
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,167
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

505
00:28:57,169 --> 00:29:00,037
And for those of you that read
the ten-volume report

506
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:02,339
issued by the Norris Commission,

507
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:04,608
well, I commend you on
your tenacity.

508
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:08,612
You already know, then,
the circumstances that led to

509
00:29:08,614 --> 00:29:13,117
the explosion of the S.T.A.R.
Labs particle accelerator.

510
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:15,986
Or rather, you think you do.

511
00:29:15,988 --> 00:29:20,090
Now, the Commission's finding
was that the catastrophe was

512
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:24,128
caused by a chain of events that
nobody could have predicted,

513
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:26,130
including myself.

514
00:29:26,132 --> 00:29:27,664
The truth is...

515
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:29,233
I was warned there was a chance

516
00:29:29,235 --> 00:29:32,669
the particle accelerator
might fail.

517
00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:34,571
I was warned by
a former colleague...

518
00:29:34,573 --> 00:29:36,940
a friend.

519
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:40,177
I chose to ignore the warning
and in so doing,

520
00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:45,349
I let down all of you.

521
00:29:45,351 --> 00:29:47,484
As a new friend pointed out...

522
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,687
I failed this city.

523
00:29:50,689 --> 00:29:55,659
I failed this city and I failed
those who trusted me the most.

524
00:29:55,661 --> 00:29:59,062
By coming forward today...

525
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:02,599
it's my hope I'm taking
the first step toward

526
00:30:02,601 --> 00:30:04,401
regaining that trust.

527
00:30:06,639 --> 00:30:08,238
And your trust as well.

528
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,843
Are there any questions?

529
00:30:12,845 --> 00:30:14,178
Do you have any intention
of rebuilding

530
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,313
the particle accelerator?

531
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:22,319
Miss West, do you have
a question for me?

532
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:27,257
I don't believe you answered
my colleague's question,

533
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:29,159
Dr. Wells,
so I'll ask it again.

534
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:30,961
Do you have any intention
of rebuilding

535
00:30:30,963 --> 00:30:33,330
the particle accelerator,
either now or in the future?

536
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:38,769
Of course not.

537
00:30:38,771 --> 00:30:41,171
Thank you for your answer,
Doctor.

538
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:43,173
It's my pleasure.

539
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:44,875
No further questions.

540
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:48,979
Hey.

541
00:30:48,981 --> 00:30:50,314
What was that?

542
00:30:50,316 --> 00:30:52,349
Gumption.

543
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:55,485
Has Hartley made contact yet?

544
00:30:55,487 --> 00:30:57,120
What makes you so sure
he will?

545
00:30:57,122 --> 00:30:58,589
Because he's Hartley,

546
00:30:58,591 --> 00:31:00,390
and he'll want to have
the last word.

547
00:31:00,392 --> 00:31:02,292
Cisco, you should be resting.

548
00:31:02,294 --> 00:31:04,061
The answer to why Hartley
fooled us into catching him

549
00:31:04,063 --> 00:31:06,230
is in here,
and I'm gonna find it.

550
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:18,742
- You have nothing to prove.
- Not true.

551
00:31:21,412 --> 00:31:25,182
Do you know why I hired you,
Cisco?

552
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:27,718
You said you saw something
in me... I know.

553
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,220
What I saw was humanity.

554
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:32,990
You and Hartley, Cisco,
you're both brilliant.

555
00:31:32,992 --> 00:31:36,193
You both have mental...

556
00:31:36,195 --> 00:31:38,562
sparks.
But his brilliance

557
00:31:38,564 --> 00:31:40,230
subtracted from the experience
of working here,

558
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:41,531
whereas your brilliance,

559
00:31:41,533 --> 00:31:44,067
your heart,

560
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:46,803
your warmth, your humor,

561
00:31:46,805 --> 00:31:48,305
it just adds to it.

562
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:56,413
There is no chosen one,
Cisco.

563
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:59,917
No second or third favorite.
Never was.

564
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,686
It's just us.

565
00:32:06,392 --> 00:32:09,092
What's that?

566
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:11,895
Nice gambit, Harrison.
But this isn't over.

567
00:32:11,897 --> 00:32:13,931
Hartley, what do you want?
What do you want, Hartley?

568
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:15,766
I already gave my mea culpa
today.

569
00:32:15,768 --> 00:32:17,868
The city already hated you.

570
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:19,636
You don't think I noticed
that press conference

571
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:21,738
was a pathetic bishop sacrifice?

572
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:24,775
No, no, no. I've played with you
too many times

573
00:32:24,777 --> 00:32:26,710
to let you get away with that.

574
00:32:26,712 --> 00:32:29,880
This is between you, me,
and The Flash.

575
00:32:29,882 --> 00:32:32,049
You don't want to play
for those kind

576
00:32:32,051 --> 00:32:33,383
of stakes with me, Hartley.

577
00:32:33,385 --> 00:32:36,119
Actually, I really do.

578
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:38,722
What do you say?
One last game of chess?

579
00:32:38,724 --> 00:32:40,590
You and I both know that
the winner of the game

580
00:32:40,592 --> 00:32:42,592
is the one who makes
the next-to-last mistake,

581
00:32:42,594 --> 00:32:44,528
and you clearly have
a move in mind.

582
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:46,063
You're right.

583
00:32:46,065 --> 00:32:48,398
And I'm already at the board.

584
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:52,469
So why don't you move your
precious scarlet knight...

585
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:58,336
While I take out a few pawns.

586
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,857
All right. All right, Cisco,
where do I go?

587
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:17,760
I can't trace the signal. He could be
sending his messages from anywhere.

588
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,100
Cisco,
scan for seismic activity.

589
00:33:20,199 --> 00:33:21,431
If Hartley's using sonic blast,

590
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:22,899
the vibrations could cause
tremors.

591
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:41,651
Look. Over here. Quake
activity but no fault line.

592
00:33:41,653 --> 00:33:43,420
The Keystone Cleveland Dam.

593
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:47,591
Barry! Don't underestimate
him. He's brilliant.

594
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,995
Well, good thing I'll have you
in here.

595
00:33:57,301 --> 00:33:59,036
Rook to knight four.

596
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:02,839
Aah!

597
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:19,389
Barry, you need to disarm
Hartley immediately.

598
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:20,857
Immediately! Do you hear me?

599
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:22,426
He is a master of distraction.

600
00:34:22,428 --> 00:34:24,995
He is a master of hiding his
true endgame.

601
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:35,672
A-ha!

602
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:39,009
Uh-oh.
Aha what?

603
00:34:39,011 --> 00:34:40,777
I figured out what Hartley

604
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:42,746
stole from S.T.A.R. Labs,
why he let himself get caught.

605
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:44,614
Which brings us to
the "uh-oh."

606
00:34:44,616 --> 00:34:47,184
He has all the data on
Barry's molecular scans.

607
00:34:47,186 --> 00:34:48,852
Why would he want that?

608
00:34:48,854 --> 00:34:50,387
He can get Barry's frequency.

609
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:52,189
Barry, you need to get out of
there!

610
00:34:52,191 --> 00:34:54,157
You need to get out of there
immediately!

611
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,734
It's over! You lose!

612
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:07,938
Amazing.
He replaced me with you?

613
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,406
Total moron.

614
00:35:09,408 --> 00:35:12,275
I got you with
the same trick twice.

615
00:35:14,646 --> 00:35:16,746
Ah!

616
00:35:16,748 --> 00:35:18,615
Uhh!

617
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:22,352
I got the idea watching you
and Harrison chit-chat...

618
00:35:22,354 --> 00:35:24,654
to use your suit's own speakers
to kill you.

619
00:35:24,656 --> 00:35:26,356
Gah!

620
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:29,726
That feeling? That's your
organs shearing apart.

621
00:35:29,728 --> 00:35:33,897
And you activated the frequency
when you disarmed me.

622
00:35:33,899 --> 00:35:36,833
In chess, we call that
a discovered attack.

623
00:35:36,835 --> 00:35:39,836
You don't see it
until it's too late.

624
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:42,272
Right, Harrison?
Aah!

625
00:35:42,274 --> 00:35:44,441
Barry's vitals are
bottoming out.

626
00:35:44,443 --> 00:35:46,076
We need to do something.

627
00:35:46,078 --> 00:35:47,844
What are you doing?

628
00:35:47,846 --> 00:35:50,013
Barry's on the travel road
of the dam, at rush hour,

629
00:35:50,015 --> 00:35:51,748
surrounded by cars.

630
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:54,151
Many of those cars are going to
have satellite radio.

631
00:35:54,153 --> 00:35:55,652
Satellite sends a signal to
the car,

632
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:57,187
song comes out the speaker...
Yes! I know

633
00:35:57,189 --> 00:35:58,989
how satellite radio works!
How does that help?

634
00:35:58,991 --> 00:36:00,590
Well, I'm gonna have the
satellite send something

635
00:36:00,592 --> 00:36:01,825
other than a song.

636
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:03,660
Hartley is about to hear
something

637
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:05,061
he was not expecting...

638
00:36:05,063 --> 00:36:06,663
a sound wave that will meet
the frequency of

639
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:08,798
and destroy his weapons.

640
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:16,239
You don't seem so special
anymore.

641
00:36:16,241 --> 00:36:18,408
Given how easy it was to bring
you down,

642
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:21,077
I wonder if Harrison will
even miss you.

643
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:35,091
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no!

644
00:36:36,894 --> 00:36:40,964
No!

645
00:36:40,966 --> 00:36:42,732
Aah!

646
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:52,809
Checkmate.

647
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,649
Barry, can you hear me?

648
00:36:59,651 --> 00:37:01,952
Sort of!

649
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:14,698
- Okay!
- How do you feel?

650
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,267
Fine! I mean there is
a little ringing in my ears,

651
00:37:17,269 --> 00:37:18,935
but other than that I'm good,
so...

652
00:37:18,937 --> 00:37:20,971
You're speaking very loudly.

653
00:37:20,973 --> 00:37:23,240
- Sorry.
- It's okay, it'll pass.

654
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:28,211
- Nice moves.
- Thank you.

655
00:37:28,213 --> 00:37:29,746
Anytime.

656
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:31,648
I think I'm gonna take my
doctor's advice

657
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:32,749
and go lie down.

658
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:34,551
What a great idea!

659
00:37:36,088 --> 00:37:38,755
Man, I feel like I'm hung over
times ten.

660
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:40,523
I'm not surprised.

661
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:48,198
It's difficult for me...

662
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,701
to admit when I'm wrong.

663
00:37:51,703 --> 00:37:54,671
Certainly, in front of
an entire city but also...

664
00:37:57,708 --> 00:38:00,043
Also to my closest friends.

665
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:06,216
So I hope one day

666
00:38:06,218 --> 00:38:09,419
to restore your trust
and faith in me.

667
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:14,190
That day was today.

668
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:26,469
Not every hero wears a mask.

669
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:30,307
Some heroes save the day in
the simplest of ways.

670
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:33,343
By just being there for us...

671
00:38:33,345 --> 00:38:36,313
or letting us know
we're believed in.

672
00:38:36,315 --> 00:38:40,216
If I'm any sort of hero today,
it's not because of my speed.

673
00:38:40,218 --> 00:38:45,288
It's because I learned how from
the people in my life...

674
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:47,624
all of them.

675
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:52,862
Hey.

676
00:38:52,864 --> 00:38:54,831
Hey.

677
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:58,501
Man, that press conference today
was something else.

678
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:02,605
Dr. Wells...
took a lot of guts to do that.

679
00:39:02,607 --> 00:39:04,207
I have to give him that.

680
00:39:04,209 --> 00:39:07,544
He has his moments.

681
00:39:07,546 --> 00:39:09,579
What's up?

682
00:39:09,581 --> 00:39:11,381
Must have been hard for you.

683
00:39:11,383 --> 00:39:13,583
What? To be this handsome?

684
00:39:13,585 --> 00:39:15,185
Raising me.

685
00:39:15,187 --> 00:39:17,520
Oh. No.

686
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:20,857
Well, a kid who loved
math and chemistry,

687
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:22,659
whose idea of
a fun afternoon was

688
00:39:22,661 --> 00:39:24,661
doing experiments in the garage.

689
00:39:24,663 --> 00:39:27,230
Couldn't have been easy.

690
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:29,899
As soon as I started AP classes,
you had

691
00:39:29,901 --> 00:39:32,869
no clue how to help me
with my homework.

692
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:35,038
- No.
- You must have always felt like

693
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:40,910
you were competing with Richard
Dawkins and Neil Tyson and...

694
00:39:40,912 --> 00:39:43,713
Henry Allen too.

695
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:46,015
But, look, none of them...
no one...

696
00:39:46,017 --> 00:39:48,551
could ever replace you.

697
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:50,453
Not even Wells.

698
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:53,556
Aw.

699
00:39:58,497 --> 00:39:59,829
All right,
I'll see you at home.

700
00:39:59,831 --> 00:40:01,664
All right.

701
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:03,733
- Hey, Eddie.
- Hey, Barry.

702
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:06,870
Hey, what'd you find out?

703
00:40:06,872 --> 00:40:10,707
I searched Wells' entire house
like you said.

704
00:40:10,709 --> 00:40:12,809
There was nothing.

705
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:16,045
Are you sure you want to
do this...

706
00:40:16,047 --> 00:40:18,281
Investigate Wells?

707
00:40:18,283 --> 00:40:19,616
100%

708
00:40:37,701 --> 00:40:42,238
Your evil hearing aids won't
help you escape this time.

709
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,274
So I'd get comfy.

710
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:47,277
You must be enjoying this,
Cisco.

711
00:40:47,279 --> 00:40:48,912
- I am.
- Ah, well,

712
00:40:48,914 --> 00:40:50,613
if that scares you,
I can't imagine

713
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:51,714
how you're gonna feel when you
open up these doors

714
00:40:51,716 --> 00:40:53,416
and let me out of here.
Hmm...

715
00:40:53,418 --> 00:40:56,286
maybe I'm going deaf,
'cause I could've sworn

716
00:40:56,288 --> 00:40:58,521
you just said I'm gonna
let you out.

717
00:40:58,523 --> 00:41:00,824
And very soon too.

718
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,395
Why would I ever do that?

719
00:41:05,397 --> 00:41:08,731
Because I know where
Ronnie Raymond is.

720
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:15,572
I know what really happened
to him that night.

721
00:41:15,574 --> 00:41:18,141
And I know how to save him.

722
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:23,913
Warning! Tachyon output
has passed acceptable

723
00:41:23,915 --> 00:41:25,315
tolerance range.

724
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:28,117
Continued exposure is not
recommended.

725
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:30,453
Increase to maximum, Gideon.

726
00:41:30,455 --> 00:41:32,655
Increasing to maximum,
Doctor.

727
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:36,159
Speed Force absorption
at 35% and rising.

728
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:40,096
I'm not stabilizing.
I can't hang on to my speed.

729
00:41:40,098 --> 00:41:42,065
It comes and goes,
and I can not control it.

730
00:41:42,067 --> 00:41:46,836
Gideon, for how much longer is
the Tachyonic device viable?

731
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:49,105
Calculations inconclusive.

732
00:41:49,107 --> 00:41:52,642
- I'm sorry, Doctor.
- Oh, that's okay, Gideon.

733
00:41:52,644 --> 00:41:56,179
This was only meant to be
a temporary fix.

734
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:59,315
The real endgame is almost here.

735
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:27,610
Greg, move your head!
