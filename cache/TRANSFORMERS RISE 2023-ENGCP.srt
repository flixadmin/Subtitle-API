1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,200
<i>There's a legend that precedes</i>

2
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,920
<i>the dawn of our civilization.</i>

3
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,880
<i>A vile god</i>

4
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,680
<i>so large and so powerful</i>

5
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,880
<i>that it consumed entire planets</i>

6
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,960
<i>as fuel.</i>

7
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,480
<i>Few believed such a thing
could be true</i>

8
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,400
<i>until the day we saw Unicron</i>

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,600
<i>with our own eyes.</i>

10
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,920
<i>But he didn't just come
for our planet.</i>

11
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,600
<i>He wanted our greatest technology</i>

12
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,760
<i>the Transwarp Key.</i>

13
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,800
<i>And he sent
his most powerful henchman</i>

14
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,880
<i>to collect it...</i>

15
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,760
<i>Scourge.</i>

16
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,800
More enemies are landing.

17
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,200
We won't be safe for long.

18
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,600
Do we have the key?

19
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,080
You must take it.

20
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,520
Keep it hidden

21
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,000
so that it never falls
into the hands of Unicron.

22
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,560
But, Apelinq, we can fight.

23
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,040
No. Protecting our Transwarp Key

24
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,240
is all that matters!

25
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,240
Go! Use it to escape.

26
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,840
What will you do?

27
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,480
I'll hold him off.

28
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,880
Buy you some time.

29
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,560
Then I'm staying with you.

30
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,520
This is my fight.

31
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,120
Listen

32
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,200
if Unicron were to get the key

33
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,040
he could open a portal
through time and space

34
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,440
with no end to the worlds
he could destroy.

35
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,240
It is now your time
to lead the Maximals

36
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,360
Optimus Primal.

37
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,680
So you're this planet's
great warrior.

38
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,080
You have such a beautiful world...

39
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,240
filled with an abundance of life.

40
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,640
Savory.

41
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,040
My master grows hungry.

42
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,600
Give me the Transwarp Key

43
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,560
and he will spare your home.

44
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,440
We'd rather die
than let him reach other planets.

45
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,840
So be it.

46
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,400
Benefits of serving
the almighty Unicron.

47
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,600
They never learn.

48
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,520
You're too late, Scourge.

49
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,080
Your master will be trapped
in this galaxy

50
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,440
forever.

51
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,680
No!

52
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,360
His sacrifice will be our oath.

53
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,600
To preserve the key

54
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,920
no matter the cost.

55
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,640
You let them slip away

56
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,800
with the Transwarp Key.

57
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,360
Scour the universe

58
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,880
and find where the Maximals
have gone.

59
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,520
When you acquire the key

60
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,400
use it to bring me to you.

61
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,440
Yes, my lord.

62
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,320
Once I have the key

63
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,720
I alone will reign supreme.

64
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,480
All right, baby, come on.

65
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,600
Show me the money. Show me the
money.

66
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,200
Here we go.

67
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,960
There we go.

68
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,720
<i>Yo, Sonic. Breakfast ready yet?</i>

69
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,760
I ain't your butler, Kris.

70
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,560
<i>Come on, man.
No names over the airwaves.</i>

71
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,640
<i>It's Tails.</i>

72
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,640
Oh, my bad.

73
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,080
Kristopher Diaz

74
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,480
from 974 Wilson Avenue,
Apartment 2-C, Brooklyn.

75
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,480
<i>No real names. They're listening.</i>

76
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,200
Ain't no secret government agencies
worried about us, Tails.

77
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,040
Now, get your behind out here
while it's hot.

78
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,640
At least they got that going for 'em.

79
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,280
Here, I ironed this for you.

80
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,480
- I already ironed it.
- Like you cooked those eggs?

81
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,120
What you mean? They're just...

82
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,240
- seasoned.
- Come on.

83
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,320
Come eat, bro.

84
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,680
I can't get past Bowser.

85
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,400
Well, good morning to you too.

86
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,440
Drink this and take your medicine.

87
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,080
- All of it.
- Okay.

88
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,000
Are you sure you can take him?

89
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,320
Yeah, hospital's on the way.
I got time.

90
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,280
And if that lady,
that administrator, is there

91
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,160
and she mentions a bill, just...

92
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,800
tell her we're handling it.

93
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,920
I will.

94
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,840
And after today,
I'll be able to help out more.

95
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,800
Good luck on the interview.

96
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,280
Don't forget to laugh
at all their jokes.

97
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,760
White people love that shit.

98
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,320
- Ma, language.
- Okay!

99
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,136
Remember, I have class tonight
so I'll be home late.

100
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,320
<i>- Los quiero.</i>
- I love you.

101
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,320
Hurry up, man.
We gotta get into the city.

102
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,680
Yo, hold up. Hold up.

103
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,240
Your hand's hurting again?

104
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,640
No, it's nothing.

105
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,680
Then let me see.

106
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,520
Kris.

107
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,120
It's swollen.

108
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,760
The sickle cells must be blocking
the blood flow again.

109
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,120
How long has this been going on?

110
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,280
Couple days.

111
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,000
Yo, look, I told you

112
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,680
you gotta tell me these things.

113
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,200
You fighting this alone
or we fighting it together?

114
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,040
Together.

115
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,960
Home team?

116
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,720
Home team.

117
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,480
Two for ten. Two for...

118
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,760
Stop touching everything.

119
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,160
Oh, hell, no.

120
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,496
Hey, yo, Kris, what'd I tell you
about letting your man

121
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,976
come outta the crib
looking like a whole square?

122
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,200
Only so much I can do.

123
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,800
Yeah, whatever, bro. Look. Here.

124
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,280
My dawg!

125
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,336
When you gonna let me
put your skills to work

126
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,480
and get you some real money?

127
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,400
Yeah, says the dude
who can't even afford cable.

128
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,720
"Says the guy who..."

129
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,080
I choose not to purchase cable.

130
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,560
It's my own personal way
to protest the vampiric nature

131
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,880
of modern-day capitalism!

132
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,000
Hey, good luck with that interview
in that dusty suit!

133
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,480
- I'm coming!
- Look at this.

134
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,560
Hey, guys.

135
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,896
That's a good one,
but the Ankylosaurus

136
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,000
was an armored dinosaur.

137
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,160
Thank you.
Thank you for being patient.

138
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,560
Intern? Intern?

139
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,880
I paged you three times.
Why didn't you call me?

140
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,280
Okay, well,
I figured if I stopped to call

141
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,440
that would make me later.

142
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,640
The police are here.

143
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,520
They busted an art auction.

144
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,080
The owner claims
that everything is authentic

145
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,080
but they want a second opinion.

146
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,280
All right.

147
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,000
The da Vinci sketch is legit.

148
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,240
The painting's a copy.

149
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,600
Real one's at the National Gallery
in London.

150
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,520
Roman vase.

151
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,240
Valuable, but...

152
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,080
you are not gonna retire off of them.

153
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,720
The center's Greek curse tablet

154
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,520
it would be expensive,
but it's a fake.

155
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,160
How can you tell?

156
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,760
See the spelling?

157
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Roman.

158
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,400
Doesn't even show up in that era.

159
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,720
Got it.

160
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,240
Officers, I figured it out.

161
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,960
So, the da Vinci, that is real.

162
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,760
Now, where did you come from?

163
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,120
What are you?

164
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,480
- It's pretty neat, right?
- Yes.

165
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,880
Where is it from?

166
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,640
They just discovered it in Sudan.

167
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,560
The boys say it's Horus

168
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,920
fifth millennia BC, Nubian?

169
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,760
This symbol is definitely
not hieroglyphic.

170
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,440
Well, if it's as exotic as it looks

171
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,160
I'm gonna get a feature in Minerva.

172
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,920
Jillian?

173
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,560
Okay, team, let's do it.

174
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,800
Okay, what are the rules?

175
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,800
Bros before hos.

176
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,440
"Don't be a problem.
Don't go looking for a problem."

177
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,176
- Or else we're gonna have a problem.
- have a problem.

178
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,440
I know. I know.

179
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,240
Okay, I'll be back in a little bit.

180
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,720
Mr. Diaz?

181
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,960
Hey, I know we're a little behind
on the bill...

182
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,040
Three months behind.

183
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,256
And until your account is current,
you can't bring your brother here.

184
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,536
- I've told you that.
- I'm gonna fix it.

185
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,656
I just need a little more time.

186
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,016
You can always take him to the ER.

187
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,440
Well, they won't see him in the ER
unless he's critical.

188
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,840
- Mr. Diaz.
- He's 11!

189
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,080
He's 11 years old.

190
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,600
Come on, Kris, we gotta go.

191
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,096
- What happened?
- I'll tell you later, man.

192
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,120
All right?

193
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,200
Come on. Let's get out of here.

194
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,400
Hey, yo, sit here.

195
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,760
And don't move!

196
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,656
<i>After a conference
with Simpson's attorney</i>

197
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,560
<i>- Howard Weitzman...</i>
- Can I help you?

198
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,240
Yes. Hey, I'm here for an interview

199
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,920
with the head of security,
Mr. Bishop.

200
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I'm Noah Diaz.

201
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,080
- It's been canceled.
- No, that has to be a mistake.

202
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,800
Came right from Mr. Bishop.

203
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,600
- Mr. Bishop!
- Hey! Hey!

204
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,880
It's okay, Walker.

205
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,280
Look, it's me, Noah Diaz.

206
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,960
Sir, I think your boy there
is confused.

207
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,256
He said our interview was canceled.

208
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,280
Because it is.

209
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,560
Wait, why?

210
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,176
On the phone,
you said I was perfect for the job.

211
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,856
- You said this was just a formality.
- It was

212
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,960
until your old commanding officer
called me back.

213
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,240
Said you were brave,
an expert comtech

214
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,440
but unreliable.

215
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,520
Couldn't trust you.

216
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,280
Your head was always somewhere else.

217
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,960
Sir, I can explain all of that.

218
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,280
I had some responsibilities at home.
My brother, he's...

219
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,960
You had a responsibility
to the United States Army.

220
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,560
Mr. Bishop! Sir.

221
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,200
I'm a hard worker, okay? I just...

222
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,320
I just really need a break.

223
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,280
Listen, I can't have someone like you

224
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,800
mess up what I've built.

225
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,560
Someone like me?

226
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,680
You don't know anything about me!

227
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,640
I know you don't know
how to be part of a team.

228
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,920
God.

229
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,160
Hey, look.

230
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,960
Superman went on
a bunch of interviews

231
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,120
before he got his job
on the <i>Daily Planet.</i>

232
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,920
- But he never gave up.
- I'm not Superman, Kris.

233
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,480
- Life ain't a comic book.
- I'm just saying.

234
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,000
You'll get the next one.

235
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,760
Yo, there is no next one.

236
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,640
No one's coming to save us.
We're alone in this.

237
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,520
Yo, man, I'm sorry.

238
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,520
It's all right.

239
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,800
No, it's not.

240
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,520
None of this is.

241
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,880
Know what?

242
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,080
Come on.

243
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,560
Go ahead, bro.

244
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,560
Yo, just head upstairs.
I'll be right there, all right?

245
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,840
So, what was you
talking about earlier?

246
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,280
Hey, yo, you want one?

247
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,320
No. I don't want any candy.

248
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,920
You gotta relax, man.

249
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,320
Your energy
is really affecting my chi.

250
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,560
And I get it.

251
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,920
I was nervous my first time too.

252
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,616
But you might want to do
some breathing exercises.

253
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,640
Look at me.

254
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,480
My man...

255
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,760
It's just I ain't done this before.

256
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,320
I know that.
But them rich cats in there...

257
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,696
they give a ton of paper
to charities every year

258
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,960
to make themselves feel better.

259
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,176
Hell, if you look at it
from a holistic perspective

260
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,520
we doing them a favor.

261
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,280
- Hey, yo, you're welcome!
- Yo, will you stop?

262
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,440
What are you doing?

263
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,680
This ain't about
to affect they pockets at all

264
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,600
and it's about to be easy as hell.

265
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,760
So why you ain't the one
going in there and doing it?

266
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,520
Because, <i>papito,</i> I'm the mastermind.

267
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,520
Now, come on, put this in your ear.

268
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,160
My man, you serious?

269
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,680
Yo, is that even clean?

270
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,080
It's the fourth quarter.

271
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,000
We got about ten seconds
left on the clock

272
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,240
and you got the rock.

273
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,720
- Get rid of this.
- Hey, man!

274
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,720
Don't slam the...

275
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,960
Okay. I am off to my fundraiser.

276
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,720
What do you think?

277
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,120
It's nice.

278
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,280
Can I run something by you?

279
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,520
So I've been doing some research

280
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,360
and I don't think
that the statuette is Horus.

281
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,280
As a matter of fact,
I'm sure it's not.

282
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,680
The boys dated it
around 5000 BC, right?

283
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,640
But the Nubians

284
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,720
they never even had contact
with the Egyptians

285
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,520
until 600 years after that.

286
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,240
The symbol's not hieroglyphic.

287
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,176
I don't even think
it's from that part of the world.

288
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,360
I think it might be Aztec or Inca.

289
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,720
It's not some Egyptian god.

290
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,120
It's something else.

291
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,280
Interesting.

292
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,720
Get those pressed, okay?

293
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,480
<i>Yeah.</i>

294
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,880
There you go.

295
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,840
Let that breath fill you up.

296
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,200
<i>In... out.</i>

297
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,960
Please stop talking.

298
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,280
Okay, alright, I get it.

299
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,816
You don't like to chitchat
back and forth.

300
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,960
But I got something for you.

301
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,040
- You got a robbing mixtape?
<i>- No.</i>

302
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,440
I got a liberating mixtape.

303
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,480
You feeling that, huh?

304
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,560
Yeah, whatever.

305
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,560
<i>All right, there shouldn't be nobody
in this part of the building.</i>

306
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,400
<i>You should be able
to just waltz right on in.</i>

307
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,720
Strike one, mastermind.
This place is packed.

308
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,800
Hey, well, to error is divine.

309
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,440
<i>Just act like you own the place.</i>

310
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,600
Hey, what's up, brother?
Good to see you again.

311
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,800
<i>Try not to look suspicious.</i>

312
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,400
Here you go. Here you go.
Sorry, sorry. That's you, bro.

313
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,656
Nice glasses. I didn't know you...

314
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,736
I didn't know you had glasses.

315
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,160
<i>What are you doing, making friends?</i>

316
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,920
<i>- Everything good?</i>
- We're in the mix.

317
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,240
Hey.

318
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,120
Let's see what you really are.

319
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,840
<i>Now, my man said
it's tucked in the back.</i>

320
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,120
Been there a couple of weeks.

321
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,440
<i>It's like a grayish car</i>

322
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,160
<i>- with, like, a...</i>
- blue stripe.

323
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,840
<i>All right, now just like brother Reek
showed you.</i>

324
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,360
Down the window...

325
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,880
a little wiggle.

326
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,440
Feel that snag and...

327
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,720
<i>Yeah.</i>

328
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,680
Now we making money.

329
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,880
All right, talk to me, homey.

330
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,440
<i>I'm in.</i>

331
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,520
This won't hurt a bit.

332
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,760
Stop...

333
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,480
No...

334
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,560
I'm gonna lose my job.

335
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,080
I'm gonna go to jail.

336
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,520
It's definitely not Nubian.

337
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,120
This cannot be.

338
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,000
Calling all Autobots!

339
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,600
Calling all Autobots!

340
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,320
<i>Yippee-ki-yay, mother...</i>

341
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,360
Prime, this is Arcee.
I have a visual.

342
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,960
What am I looking at?

343
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,680
A way home.

344
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,720
<i>Calling all Autobots!</i>

345
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,200
<i>Calling all Autobots!</i>

346
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,800
- What am I doing?
<i>- Well, the coast is clear out here</i>

347
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,161
<i>so whenever you want to slide
that thing on out, you good.</i>

348
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,200
I can't. I can't.

349
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,680
<i>You can't drive stick or something?</i>

350
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,840
No, it's just...

351
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,400
I ain't no thief.

352
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,680
<i>Are you having
an existential crisis now?</i>

353
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,016
The deadline for that
was when I offered you Twizzlers.

354
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,960
<i>This is an emergency.
Can you hear me, Mirage?</i>

355
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,120
<i>- Roll out!</i>
- Hey, yo, who the hell was that?

356
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,560
Yo, that's the radio, bro.
This car is buggin'. I'm out.

357
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,440
Hey!

358
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,320
Oh, shit...

359
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,560
- Oh, shit...
- Hey, you!

360
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,120
Get out of the car!

361
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,120
I'm trying!
The car started by itself, I promise!

362
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,080
- Look, it's not working!
- Get out now!

363
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,160
No! No! Wait! What you doing?

364
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,360
Noah, what's...

365
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,320
Reek...

366
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,840
Now, that's top-tier manifestation!

367
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,960
Yo, the car's driving by itself!

368
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,880
Noah, you good?

369
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,360
I don't know what's going on!

370
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,640
It won't stop!

371
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,920
Yo, stop! Stop!
Why aren't you listening?

372
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,160
You might want to slow down.

373
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,856
It's not me, it's the car!
It's possessed!

374
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,880
<i>No...</i>

375
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,440
You're just on an adrenaline high.

376
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,680
Let's do some of them
breathing exercises.

377
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,720
Yo, I don't need
no breathing exercises!

378
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,120
The car's driving by itself!

379
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,200
Oh, snap.

380
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,800
Yo, Reek, what do we do?

381
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,960
- Noah, I cannot hear you.
<i>- Reek!</i>

382
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,040
Noah, I can't...

383
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,040
No! No, he did not!
No, he did not just leave me!

384
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,360
Pull over!

385
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,440
Help me!

386
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,200
Are you...

387
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,080
Drive...

388
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,880
The bridge...

389
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,960
Take the Williamsburg!

390
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,240
I got a 10-37 in progress.
Silver Porsche.

391
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,040
You serious, man?

392
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,880
Oh, nah. Oh, nah.

393
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,400
Yo, do something, please!

394
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,720
Yo, nah.

395
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,080
Nah...

396
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,960
<i>Come in.</i>

397
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,360
<i>- Can you hear me, Mirage?</i>
- What?

398
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,240
Mirage.

399
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,040
Yo... slow down! Slow down!

400
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,480
That felt good!

401
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,360
Gets the oil pumping, you know? Damn!

402
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,680
I've been cooped up forever, dude.

403
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,640
I can't tell you how old it gets.

404
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,440
"Mirage, stay hidden."

405
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,520
"Mirage, don't draw any attention
to yourself."

406
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,080
"Mirage, <i>Big</i> is just a movie.

407
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,080
You'll never be a real boy."

408
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,360
But that was fun, man.
You're fun, dude.

409
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,400
Oh, right.

410
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,640
This is probably a lot for you, huh?

411
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,200
- Back up!
- Hey...

412
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,456
What's with the aggression?

413
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,400
I thought after the car chase,
we were boys.

414
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,520
Are you gonna hit me?

415
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,960
Maybe.

416
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,040
It's like that?

417
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,520
Tough guy. I like that.

418
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,360
I like it a lot.

419
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,440
What are you?

420
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,160
Some sort of possessed car
or something?

421
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,400
Nah. That's not real, man.

422
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,000
- I'm an alien.
- Like...

423
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,120
- Like E.T.?
- E.T.?

424
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,680
The little ugly guy in the basket?

425
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,840
Look at this face!

426
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,320
The name's Mirage.

427
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,040
Come on. Give me a little...

428
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,120
Give me a little tap.
Give me a little tap.

429
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,040
There you go. Now we're friends!

430
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,760
Oh, great. The gang's here.

431
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,240
- There are more like you?
- Like me?

432
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,760
Nah. But be cool
so they don't crush you.

433
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,360
- What?
- Yeah, I'd put that pipe down

434
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,440
if I were you.

435
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,880
Well, well.

436
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,280
Who have we got here?

437
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,600
Mirage, what have you done?

438
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,760
You brought a human here?

439
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,200
Optimus! Hey!

440
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,440
Looking good, man!

441
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,200
Wait a second. Are those new rims?

442
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,200
You were told to stay hidden.

443
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,160
Right. Right. Crazy coincidence.

444
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,960
When you called, all Optimus-like

445
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,280
"Autobots, roll out!"

446
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,920
this guy was already in the car.

447
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,800
But he's cool, so it's cool. Cool?

448
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,080
Not cool.

449
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,880
Who are you, human?

450
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,816
I'm nobody.
I ain't even seen nothing.

451
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,360
I'm not even seeing anything
right now.

452
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,320
Arcee.

453
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,840
Private Noah Diaz, US Army.

454
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,400
Multiple commendations.
A wizard with electronics.

455
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,480
He's a soldier.

456
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,800
He does not look like a soldier.

457
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,200
I mean,
you looking pretty rough yourself.

458
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,160
Sorry, sir.

459
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,160
I will deal with your mistake later.

460
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,960
Okay. The energy surge we felt

461
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,960
was in the 4,000 yottahertz range

462
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,880
which is undetectable to humans.

463
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,440
I've reconstructed the source
from the energy echoes.

464
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,160
I cannot believe it.

465
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,640
It exists and it is here.

466
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,280
What the hell am I looking at?

467
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,280
The Transwarp Key.

468
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,600
It was thought to be lost

469
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,080
thousands of years ago.

470
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,840
It was once used to open
space-time portals

471
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,840
to Energon-rich planets

472
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,080
throughout the universe.

473
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,760
You mean Energon-rich planets like...

474
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,840
Cybertron.

475
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,920
After seven long years
stranded on Earth

476
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,280
we've finally found a way home.

477
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,040
Wait 'til I catch you, Reek.

478
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,960
Okay, so where is this
tran... trun...

479
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,600
- Transwarp Key?
- Thank you.

480
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,400
It's in the new museum
on Ellis Island.

481
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,960
Let's blow it up
and get the hell out of Dodge.

482
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,840
No, we can't just go in blasting
and steal it, Bee.

483
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,000
The humans will hunt us down.

484
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,160
What we need is a quiet way in.

485
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,280
How 'bout him?

486
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,520
- No.
- What? Come on, man.

487
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,736
He could slip in right through
one of them little doors

488
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,280
grab the key,
leave a nice IOU and peace out.

489
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,360
He's perfect.

490
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,960
What?

491
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,000
No, it is a bad idea.

492
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,720
I agree with Big Man.

493
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,000
So, it's been real, y'all, but...

494
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,560
Time-out. No...

495
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,200
I know. Just relax.

496
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,000
Let me just talk to my guy
real quick.

497
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,040
Yo, don't leave me
with these tight-asses, bro.

498
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,320
We make a great team.

499
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,280
This is a waste of time.

500
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,760
I'm not breaking into a museum
for some space robots.

501
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,560
But what about for friendship?

502
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,760
Or...

503
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,640
What about for cash?

504
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,000
You help us get this key
so we can get off this rock...

505
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,000
No offense.
Love the neighborhood and all.

506
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,320
And then I let you sell me.

507
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,880
Lambo?

508
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,560
Ferrari?

509
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,320
Indy?

510
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,040
Look, you get paid
and then I'll split.

511
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,400
So all I gotta do is walk in and out?

512
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,960
All you gotta do.
We'll take care of the rest.

513
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,000
Cross my spark and hope to die.

514
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,760
That was corny
when I said it out loud.

515
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,840
What about the big man?

516
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,440
Optimal, or whatever.

517
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,400
You let me worry about him.

518
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,880
Cool?

519
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,440
Got him! He's in, baby!

520
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,760
So, y'all are robots
that transform into cars

521
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,760
even though you're from way out
in space.

522
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,896
But now there's this key
that opens a portal

523
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,920
back to your home?

524
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,440
And you know this because
there's a beacon light in the sky

525
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,200
that I can't see because I'm human.

526
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,720
You say that like it's weird.

527
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,800
- It's super weird.
- You know what's weird?

528
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,840
Marky Mark
is leaving the Funky Bunch!

529
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,000
I heard he's just gonna pursue
acting now.

530
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,160
- That's crazy!
- What?

531
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,640
- How does that...
- What a world.

532
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,520
Whatever, man.

533
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,056
I'm just trying to collect this money

534
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,720
and get your angry-ass boss
off of Earth

535
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,960
before he blows a gasket.

536
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,160
Don't take it personal.

537
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,480
He just misses home.

538
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,840
And I think he blames himself
for us getting stuck here.

539
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,040
Earth was supposed to be a pit stop

540
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,960
you know, a place for us to regroup
and rejoin the war back home.

541
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,840
Prime feels like it's his fault
we've been stranded here

542
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,840
like he has to fix it all on his own.

543
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,800
<i>All right, team, heads up.</i>

544
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,600
<i>- There's security up ahead.</i>
- Nice!

545
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,040
This is gonna be fun, man.

546
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,840
No, bro. You need to switch it up.

547
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,840
You need to turn into a helicopter

548
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,680
or a speedboat or something.

549
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,840
I got something way better than that.

550
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,960
Good call.

551
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,640
I do not like this plan.

552
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,440
Yeah, Mirage isn't really known
for being quiet.

553
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,480
At least Mirage is one of us.

554
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,680
We should not be relying on a human.

555
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
They are my friends.

556
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,400
I know one was good to you, Bee

557
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,080
but this is not our world.

558
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,960
The humans will always protect
what is theirs.

559
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,360
We can only trust our own kind.

560
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,760
You can't handle the truth!

561
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,680
I do not want you going
to that drive-in theater anymore.

562
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,400
Nightbird, search the island.

563
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,080
Finally, the hunt draws to a close.

564
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,440
Hello?

565
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,800
Fudge.

566
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,720
Hey, are you okay?

567
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,840
- Are you okay?
- Back up...

568
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,640
I didn't think anyone was in here.

569
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,760
That's it.

570
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,960
Who are you?

571
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,720
I'm...

572
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,680
the janitor.

573
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,960
Security!

574
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,760
No... You don't have to do that!

575
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,960
It's not what it looks like.

576
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,080
It looks like you're trying to steal
museum property.

577
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,480
Okay,
it's a little what it looks like.

578
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,960
Shit.

579
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,960
Hey, yo...

580
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,760
- It doesn't belong to you anyway.
- No!

581
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,960
Just stop! Just...

582
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,640
Hey! Relax, relax,
and let me explain.

583
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,720
Let me...

584
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,240
It belongs to...

585
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,760
to these...

586
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,080
these giant robots

587
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,800
from space.

588
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,920
Really?

589
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,280
Look, I'm gonna need that...

590
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,720
Damn!

591
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,480
- Damn!
- Hey...

592
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,960
What's going on here? Don't move.

593
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,600
Man, it's about time you showed up!

594
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,280
The key.

595
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,600
- You were telling the truth.
- Yeah.

596
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,800
But those ones aren't with me.

597
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,280
Rip the flesh from their bones

598
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,120
and bring me the key.

599
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,160
It's yours.

600
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,280
Guys, we got company!

601
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,520
Autobots, protect the key!

602
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,280
Catch!

603
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,960
Not so fast!

604
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,360
Oh, they're flying now?
Who the hell are these guys?

605
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,280
Impossible!

606
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,240
I enjoy that look of confusion

607
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,960
when an inferior being
meets a higher power.

608
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,720
What the hell are those things?

609
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,680
Are you okay?

610
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,320
- Hey! Stop following me!
- I'm not following you!

611
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,200
I'm just escaping
in the same direction.

612
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,920
Run!

613
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,680
Go! Go!

614
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,520
Run!

615
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,760
Go!

616
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,400
Watch out! Watch out!

617
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,480
Thanks.

618
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,400
Scourge, I have eyes on the key.

619
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,560
Prime, I don't think
we can hold these guys...

620
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,280
Oh, no!

621
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,680
My God! Put me down!

622
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,080
That was so scary.

623
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,720
Oh, cool, you're still alive.

624
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,600
Get the key!

625
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,800
Noah, get out of here!

626
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,000
Get off me! I hate spiders!

627
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,960
Go!

628
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,360
Don't die...

629
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,880
Go! Get out of here!

630
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,960
Leaving so soon?

631
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,200
Look out!

632
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,720
The key!

633
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,160
Enough of these games.

634
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,400
I'll get it myself.

635
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,280
Not on my watch.

636
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,000
Don't be frightened, humans.

637
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:44,040
This'll all be over soon.

638
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,320
And you call yourself a Prime.

639
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:52,080
Primus would be ashamed.

640
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:08,600
I'm tired of little things
getting in my way.

641
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,320
Bee!

642
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,360
O Captain! My Captain!

643
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,240
No!

644
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,680
Bee.

645
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,200
Now to add a Prime to my collection.

646
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,600
Maximals.

647
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:59,320
Good. Maybe we'll get a real fight.

648
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,720
No.

649
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,000
We got what we came for.

650
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,400
No.

651
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,120
This...

652
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,600
cannot be.

653
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,440
We must go now. Come with me.

654
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,440
This is my fault.

655
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,520
It should've been me.

656
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,120
I'm sorry for your loss.

657
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,920
No offense, lady,
but who are you again?

658
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:09,000
My name is Airazor.

659
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,080
I am a Maximal.

660
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,400
A warrior
from both your past and future.

661
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,960
Oh, right.

662
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,520
That tracks. Yeah.

663
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,160
We fled our home planet

664
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,120
on the eve of its destruction.

665
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,680
We sought refuge

666
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,280
and hid here on Earth.

667
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:27,400
All right, so you're a Maximal.
Y'all are Autobots.

668
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,256
What was those things
that attacked us earlier?

669
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,440
Terrorcons.

670
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:33,040
Servants of a dark, hungry god

671
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,640
who feeds on entire worlds

672
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,080
to sustain himself.

673
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,920
Unicron.

674
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,280
So you're saying this thing Unicron
eats planets to survive?

675
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:42,840
Yes.

676
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,840
And he imbues his servants

677
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,640
like Scourge, with dark energy

678
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:50,080
which makes him all but invincible.

679
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,480
He is entirely beholden to Unicron.

680
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,080
Through his power,
he possesses Scourge's soul.

681
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,480
Awaken, my dark master.

682
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,560
Rise.

683
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:23,000
My hunger is killing me.

684
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,800
What have you found?

685
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,360
Salvation.

686
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:31,040
The galaxy will once again
be yours to feast on, my master.

687
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,120
I should've gotten the key myself.

688
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,600
I should've known better
than to rely on humans.

689
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,600
Yo, hold up. What, you blaming me?

690
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,080
After you conveniently
left out the part

691
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,480
about a planet-eating monster?

692
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,960
Because of you,
Unicron will now use the key

693
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:48,080
to consume every planet
in the universe!

694
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,560
Including my home world.

695
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,080
He doesn't have the key.

696
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,000
At least not all of it.

697
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,880
You fool!

698
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,840
This is only half the key.

699
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,080
Please!

700
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:02,720
The Maximals...

701
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,280
They must have split it.

702
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:06,680
Excuses!

703
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:07,920
Complete the key

704
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,320
or else you will wish you had died
with the rest of your planet.

705
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,440
We broke the key into two pieces
for safekeeping

706
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,080
then splintered and went into hiding.

707
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,640
I do not know
where the other half is.

708
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,080
For all I know

709
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:25,440
I am the last of our kind.

710
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,280
It's in Peru.

711
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:29,440
How you know that?

712
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,920
It's the symbols on the stone.

713
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,000
They were only ever recorded
in one other place in the world.

714
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:36,080
The Inca Temple of the Sun in Cusco.

715
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:39,560
It's one of the oldest buildings
in the western hemisphere, I'm...

716
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,280
I'm guessing that
that can't be a coincidence.

717
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,320
If you can track
those symbols to Peru

718
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,720
so can the Terrorcons.

719
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,360
We need to get there before they do.

720
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:51,320
And then kill Scourge
and take his piece

721
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,800
- to complete the key.
- Yo, hold up.

722
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,200
Hold up.

723
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,920
You want to find this other key

724
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,800
and deliver it to the guy
that just kicked your asses.

725
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,960
The Transwarp Key
is our only way home.

726
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,560
If this dude gets ahold of that thing

727
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,160
it's game over for Earth!

728
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:06,840
Our families, everybody.

729
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,120
- I'm going.
- Out of the question.

730
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,400
No offense

731
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,680
but I'm not trusting my home to a guy
who couldn't even protect his.

732
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,400
This is my planet.

733
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:22,920
I'm going.

734
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,560
What about you?

735
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,240
Me?

736
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:29,680
What is your name?

737
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:31,520
Elena.

738
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,080
Elena,
will you lead us to this temple?

739
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:39,840
Chance to stop the end of the world.

740
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:41,920
Actually...

741
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,400
you'll be saving two worlds.

742
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Yeah.

743
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,160
<i>Yo, is that you, Sonic?</i>

744
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,760
What are you doing up, Tails?

745
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:10,840
<i>I can't sleep.</i>

746
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:22,240
This too hot?

747
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,160
You playing that game too much.

748
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:26,336
Give it a rest, know what I'm saying?

749
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,560
- So your hand can take a break.
- I'm gonna beat it.

750
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,520
My money's on you, bro.

751
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,040
We don't quit.

752
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:35,760
Come on, get some sleep, all right?

753
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:44,920
Yo, listen...

754
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:47,360
I gotta head out for a while.

755
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,640
And I don't know
when I'm gonna be back.

756
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:51,760
Why?

757
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,600
Oh, shit.

758
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:04,160
No! Stop, please!

759
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,240
Turn off! Turn off!

760
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:06,840
I told you to sit tight.

761
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:08,856
- Stop it.
- I can't turn it off. I'm sorry.

762
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,000
Is that a robot?

763
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,680
No... Go back to bed.

764
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:12,760
Shut it off!

765
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:13,896
- Your bad hot-wiring
- I told you to sit tight.

766
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,440
- Messed up my lights.
- I got the bat.

767
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,440
- Yo, chill. Give me that.
- Did he say "bat?"

768
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:18,600
You're gonna wake up Ma.

769
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:26,080
I know you're a robot.

770
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:28,600
Kris?

771
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,680
Yo! You scratched my paint!

772
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:41,320
- What are you doing?
- Man!

773
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,696
They didn't treat E.T. like this.

774
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,880
- You know this thing?
- Yeah, we're just...

775
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:46,760
work friends.

776
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,040
"Work friends?"

777
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:49,640
You've been inside me.

778
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:52,520
Look, that thing I told you
I have to go do?

779
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,360
It's for him and his crew.

780
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,336
We're trying to stop
the end of the world.

781
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:57,440
The world's ending?

782
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,680
- No!
- Maybe. Sixty-forty.

783
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,720
You know I'm not
gonna let that happen.

784
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,640
But that's why I have to leave.

785
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:08,760
I'll go get my things.

786
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,400
- Tough kid.
- What? No.

787
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:12,920
Hold up... Wait.

788
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,200
- You're not coming.
- Why?

789
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,720
You need someone to watch your back.

790
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,640
It's too dangerous, Kris.

791
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,200
And I need you to stay here
and take care of Mom.

792
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:25,360
'Cause you might not come back.

793
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,000
Hey, robot.

794
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:43,120
Me? 'Sup?

795
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:45,520
Watch out for my brother.

796
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:47,560
Okay?

797
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,320
You got it, little man.

798
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:50,600
Nah, I'm serious.

799
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,480
If he gets hurt,
I'm coming after you.

800
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:57,520
Don't worry. I got Noah's back.

801
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:58,800
I promise.

802
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,400
Home team?

803
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:07,440
Home team.

804
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:12,480
Kid's got heart.

805
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,040
<i>Cojones muy grande.</i>

806
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:28,040
Wu-Tang is in the building, baby!

807
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,480
Way to be incognito.

808
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:32,400
Come on, Prime.

809
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,200
Smile a little bit. It won't hurt.

810
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:35,560
Let me see that underbite.

811
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:36,600
All right.

812
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,760
So what kind of jet
we taking to Peru?

813
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,480
Or is it a plane? Either one's fine.

814
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:43,200
I just need first class, okay?
'Cause I got long-ass legs.

815
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,760
Well, he is a plane.

816
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:46,040
No...

817
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:47,880
Don't tell me we're flying on...

818
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:49,440
Oh, no.

819
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,040
My lads!

820
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:11,440
I am Stratosphere, lord of the skies!

821
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:19,920
Yeah, I'm walking to Peru.

822
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:29,080
<i>Chasing waterfalls...</i>

823
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,280
Oh, my gosh.

824
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:36,320
<i>I know that you're gonna have it
Your way or nothing at all</i>

825
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,800
<i>But I think you're moving too fast</i>

826
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:41,800
Sorry.

827
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,120
I sing when I get nervous.
It usually calms me down.

828
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:46,680
First time flying?

829
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,920
Man, this is my first time
leaving New York.

830
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,520
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

831
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:55,120
So the Bronx, huh?

832
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:57,400
Brooklyn, all right?

833
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:58,800
East New York all day.

834
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:00,920
I'm from Bushwick.

835
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,240
Really?

836
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,520
Me and my dad,
we used to go to this...

837
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:08,000
this pizza spot down on
Knickerbocker and Greene.

838
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,080
Tony's Pizza?

839
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,120
So, tell me about him, your pops.

840
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:19,280
- What was he like?
- He was a...

841
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:22,320
He was a cabbie for 40 years.

842
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,360
Smartest guy you ever met.

843
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,800
He could talk to you about anything.

844
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,920
History, science, cricket.

845
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Cricket?

846
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,800
And he ain't never
even go to college either.

847
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,240
He used to always say

848
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:39,240
"If you keep your eyes
and your ears open

849
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:42,320
life will show you
everything you need to know."

850
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:46,960
So that's why you said yes
to all of this.

851
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:50,000
I figured if he is somewhere watching

852
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:52,200
then seeing his daughter do something

853
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:53,880
crazy like this

854
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,200
would definitely make him proud.

855
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,200
You really think this key thing's
in Peru?

856
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:09,760
I think so.

857
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:11,400
The evidence lines up.

858
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:16,040
Well, if it is,
and we get our hands on it...

859
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:17,920
then we got to destroy it.

860
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:19,200
What?

861
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:22,160
They can't unite the key
without both pieces.

862
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:26,040
No key, no Unicron,
no Earth getting eaten.

863
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,560
Yeah, but then they can't get home.

864
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:34,560
We gotta think about us.

865
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,240
Look, all you gotta do is find it.

866
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:42,400
And I'll take care of the rest.

867
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,320
Do you think an Energon infusion
could bring him back?

868
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:51,880
Perhaps.

869
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,960
If we could get him back
to Cybertron.

870
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,880
I never should have taken us
so far from home.

871
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,640
Wheeljack needs to fix
that power steering.

872
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:46,560
Sorry, I'm late.

873
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,560
I was taking in a harmonious moment

874
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:52,000
between a serene butterfly
and an unruffled caterpillar.

875
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,120
Such tranquility.

876
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,240
<i>Oye, papo,</i> where you from?

877
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:57,320
Cybertron.

878
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:58,640
So where'd you get that accent?

879
00:56:58,680 --> 00:56:59,920
Accent? What accent?

880
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,320
You know what I'm saying?
I'm just saying it's cool.

881
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,776
Like, I was about to be like,
<i>"¿Yo, mira, papi, de dónde eres?"</i>

882
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:07,400
<i>Pero</i> I didn't want to assume
that you speak Spanish too

883
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,280
because then... Right?

884
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:12,200
A little racist, <i>Hermano.</i>

885
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:13,456
I'm not trying to be, you know....

886
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:15,000
- Yo.
- But anyway...

887
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:17,120
The mission. Follow me.

888
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,000
But he's a robot, like... so...

889
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:21,120
how's that racist?

890
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:27,080
Okay, you guys, check this out.

891
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,920
The coordinates you gave me
correspond to an old church.

892
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,240
Take a look.

893
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:34,920
That's Santo Domingo.

894
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:37,096
The Spanish built it
on top of an old Inca temple.

895
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:40,000
<i>Correcto.</i> I picked up
some residual energy readings

896
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:41,080
around the courtyard

897
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,280
so I'm guessing
the key's somewhere close by.

898
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:45,880
But we may have some trouble
getting there.

899
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:46,960
Inti Raymi.

900
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:49,680
It's a festival that shuts down
the whole city.

901
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,840
- Guess it's a night mission then.
- No.

902
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:54,440
Scourge could already be here.

903
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:56,240
We must retrieve the other half

904
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:57,480
before he does.

905
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:00,800
Me and Elena will do it.

906
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,520
Y'all would never make it two blocks.

907
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,680
There's human security
all around the church.

908
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,536
- You'll never get through.
- Then we'll have to take a play

909
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:08,560
out of your book.

910
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:10,600
We'll hide in plain sight.

911
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:12,960
We'll blend in with the parade.

912
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:15,920
It is not a bad idea.

913
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,400
We will keep an eye out
for the Terrorcons.

914
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:23,040
On first sign of trouble,
we are going in.

915
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:24,360
Yo, Noah, think fast.

916
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,360
And if you need help, just holler.

917
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:49,600
I am in position.

918
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,760
All right. Coast is clear.

919
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:54,320
<i>Noah, Elena, it's go time.</i>

920
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:57,120
<i>Blend in. Act natural.</i>

921
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:31,240
Autobots must be using their new pets

922
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:32,960
to reach the temple.

923
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:35,280
Lovely.

924
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:38,120
They're doing our work for us.

925
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:40,400
Go fetch.

926
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:46,880
The key's gotta be in here somewhere.

927
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:48,840
Yeah.

928
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:03,960
That stonework is 17th century.

929
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:07,280
What we're looking for is something

930
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:11,000
much, much older.

931
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:20,120
What is it?

932
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:21,840
It's the same insignia on Airazor.

933
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:24,080
But it's not lined up right.

934
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:28,040
Wait, you see that?

935
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,760
I think there's something

936
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:32,360
under here.

937
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:38,280
There's another one.

938
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:44,160
There is.

939
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:53,920
Now what?

940
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:56,200
I thought it would've...

941
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,240
That's some <i>Indiana Jones</i>-type shit.

942
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:15,360
You sure about this?

943
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:17,120
No.

944
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:27,480
Any sign of Scourge?

945
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:28,920
Nope, all clear here.

946
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:31,560
Yeah, it's just groupies over here.

947
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,480
Stay on task, Mirage.

948
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:37,040
Prime, you gotta learn how to relax,
my man.

949
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:01,456
You know, we must be
the first people to walk here

950
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:02,560
in half a millennium.

951
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:06,960
<i>Yo, Sonic. You dead yet?</i>

952
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:10,080
No.

953
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:11,920
Wait, did you just call me Sonic?

954
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:13,840
I think that's a temple.

955
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:21,680
What are we looking for?

956
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:23,880
You see the symbols on that temple?

957
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,920
They match the ones in the courtyard.

958
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:27,320
I think it's up there.

959
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,600
I think we found
what we came here for.

960
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,536
I always wondered
what it would feel like to be there

961
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:47,080
when artifacts were actually found.

962
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:51,760
All right.

963
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:52,960
Now, come on, push.

964
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:02,600
Are you even pushing?

965
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:04,360
Yeah, I'm pushing.

966
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:17,480
- Wait, what?
- Just let me think.

967
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,360
Oh, no. Where is it?

968
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:20,640
Sometimes there's like a...

969
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,160
like a false bottom or something.

970
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:29,720
Look. I think I found something.

971
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:30,800
You see these symbols?

972
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:32,280
I've seen markings like this

973
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:34,120
the Airazor statue at my museum.

974
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:35,680
They're new.

975
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:37,960
They're not on the Transwarp Key.

976
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:39,600
There's two of them.

977
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:50,160
Mirage?

978
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:55,120
Let's keep moving.

979
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:56,320
Just give me a second.

980
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:01,760
Run!

981
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:10,800
Go!

982
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,280
Mirage! We got trouble!

983
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:14,816
<i>One of those things is down here!</i>

984
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:15,840
<i>Where are you guys?</i>

985
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,240
Hang tight! I'm on the way.

986
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,120
The Autobots are moving.

987
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:23,960
They must have found the key.

988
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:36,560
Come on!

989
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:39,520
Airazor, where are the humans?

990
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:41,680
They're underground,
heading towards the jungle.

991
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:00,880
Oh, man, they're tailing us!

992
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,040
- Do something!
- What do you want me to do?

993
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:21,080
You had a gun this whole time?

994
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:40,640
Prime, what the hell are you doing?

995
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:43,360
I'm going to take back Scourge's key

996
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:46,280
and then take off his head.

997
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:58,920
Guys!

998
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:02,000
- I could use a little help!
- Did someone call for backup?

999
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,400
- Brake...
- What?

1000
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:13,960
Brake!

1001
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:27,000
This is for Bee!

1002
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:40,040
Come here.

1003
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:42,040
Hold on!

1004
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:03,240
I love your fire, Prime.

1005
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:07,280
But you're going to die
on this speck of dust.

1006
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:10,720
I can think of no better place
to bury you.

1007
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:39,520
I will end you, Scourge.

1008
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:44,200
That is a promise.

1009
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:46,320
They're getting away.

1010
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:48,240
Not this time.

1011
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:56,800
I hear water.

1012
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Where are we?

1013
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:09,440
What was that?

1014
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:24,080
Who are you?

1015
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:26,440
And why are you hunting for the key?

1016
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:29,200
Yo, Donkey Kong,
stay away from my friends!

1017
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:30,800
- Mirage?
- Don't worry.

1018
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:31,960
Your boy's got this.

1019
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:36,600
Stranger danger! Stranger danger!

1020
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:38,800
Hey!

1021
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:40,440
Not so fast.

1022
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:46,960
Hey.

1023
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,200
Over here, kitty, kitty.

1024
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:50,800
Stand down!

1025
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:56,440
I won't ask a second time.

1026
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:03,200
No! All of you, stop!

1027
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:07,480
Airazor.

1028
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:10,040
Primal. I thought you were lost.

1029
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:11,520
All of you.

1030
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:12,880
The others...

1031
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:14,640
Are they...

1032
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:16,960
I am all that is left.

1033
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:24,000
Prime, these are my fellow Maximals.

1034
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:25,200
Rhinox.

1035
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:27,200
Cheetor.

1036
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:28,920
Sorry about scaring you, brother.

1037
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:31,280
Scared? Please.

1038
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:33,760
I'm not scared.
That's just engine oil.

1039
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,280
And our leader

1040
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,120
Optimus Primal.

1041
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:40,720
Optimus Primal?

1042
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:42,480
Named after you

1043
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:45,000
the legendary warrior of Cybertron.

1044
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:46,680
It's an honor.

1045
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:50,720
Airazor,
I'm happy to see you, old friend

1046
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:53,600
but bringing others here
was not part of our plan.

1047
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:56,200
I fear you bring dark tidings.

1048
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:58,720
Scourge has come to Earth.

1049
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:00,240
He's found us.

1050
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:02,440
And he has half of the key.

1051
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:05,480
We must find the second piece
before he does.

1052
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:06,760
But it wasn't in the cave.

1053
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:08,040
It was.

1054
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:10,360
But we moved it long ago
to keep it safe.

1055
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:12,040
Where is it now?

1056
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:16,680
Come with me.

1057
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:26,360
That doesn't look so good.

1058
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:29,840
When Scourge touches you,
he leaves a mark.

1059
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:31,920
But I'll be all right.

1060
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:47,000
Hey, back there you called me Sonic.

1061
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:48,040
Yeah.

1062
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:50,520
Your little bro's got this thing
about using real names

1063
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:53,080
- over the airwaves, so...
- Wait, you been talking to Kris?

1064
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:56,240
He gave me this to keep tabs on you

1065
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:58,280
make sure I'm keeping my promise.

1066
01:10:58,360 --> 01:10:59,360
Oh, here.

1067
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:01,640
Next time, include warning labels.

1068
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,480
Nah, go ahead. Keep it.

1069
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:06,320
I guess it does look better on me.

1070
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:09,320
Just don't ask
what part of my body it came from.

1071
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:13,440
So, who are you?

1072
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:16,240
We Maximals are an advanced race

1073
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:20,040
dedicated to the expansion of life
throughout the universe.

1074
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:23,520
We use the Transwarp Key
to visit young worlds.

1075
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:26,640
The Nazca Lines,
the Temple at Tikal...

1076
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:28,200
That was you guys, right?

1077
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:29,640
Not us.

1078
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:32,600
We cannot claim credit
for human ingenuity.

1079
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:34,160
But you had the key.

1080
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:35,760
Why stay on this world?

1081
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:38,000
When Unicron destroyed our world

1082
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:41,240
we took an oath
dedicated to the preservation of life

1083
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:43,280
no matter the cost.

1084
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:45,800
And Earth has been a safe refuge.

1085
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:25,120
This is Amaru.

1086
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:28,840
He and his family
are the last descendants of a tribe

1087
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:30,400
that has watched over us

1088
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:32,040
for hundreds of years.

1089
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:33,640
When we arrived

1090
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:35,920
they shared their world with us.

1091
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:38,480
And together, we protected its people

1092
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:41,320
and our secret.

1093
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:49,760
You allied with humans.

1094
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:51,680
We did.

1095
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:55,400
If you give us this key

1096
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:57,760
tomorrow I will light the beacon

1097
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:00,000
and bring Scourge to us.

1098
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:02,760
The Maximals
have already sacrificed one home

1099
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:04,040
to protect the universe.

1100
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:05,880
I won't risk losing another.

1101
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:09,120
As a leader, I know you understand.

1102
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:36,320
He is not the Optimus Prime
I imagined.

1103
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:39,520
Well, he has lost so much.

1104
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:41,320
Many more will perish

1105
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:43,880
if the key falls
into the wrong hands.

1106
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:47,960
If you had another chance
to save our home

1107
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:50,000
would you act any differently?

1108
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:55,120
Optimus, come.

1109
01:13:55,480 --> 01:13:56,720
I want to show you something.

1110
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:03,680
Your friend will find peace here.

1111
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:07,600
This is raw Energon.

1112
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:09,840
The valley is rich with it.

1113
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:11,840
Could this revive Bee?

1114
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:15,160
I'm sorry, but in this state,
it is inert.

1115
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:17,840
It would take a great power
to ignite it.

1116
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:20,080
Greater than anything we have here.

1117
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:26,400
I see that you are surprised
we entrust the key to them.

1118
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:27,800
Yes, I am.

1119
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:30,640
I've been amongst them
a long time now.

1120
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:34,000
There is more to them
than meets the eye.

1121
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:36,000
They are worth saving.

1122
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:11,160
What if we didn't destroy it?

1123
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:16,400
Maybe there's another way to...

1124
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:18,080
to save both our homes.

1125
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:21,120
Elena,
I made a lot of mistakes in my life.

1126
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:24,160
This is different.

1127
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:28,400
I can't fail at this.

1128
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:30,960
I can't let my family down.

1129
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:32,960
You're just like him.

1130
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:34,800
You know that?

1131
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:35,880
Who?

1132
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:37,200
Optimus.

1133
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:39,680
I'm serious.

1134
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:41,480
He feels it too.

1135
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:42,760
Feels what?

1136
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:44,720
Like a beast of burden

1137
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:47,360
just trying to carry

1138
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:49,240
the weight of the world
on his shoulders.

1139
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:51,800
You think he's some...

1140
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:53,960
some general barking orders

1141
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:56,240
but when I look at him

1142
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:58,920
all I see is a big brother
trying to protect his family.

1143
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:55,400
Are you okay?

1144
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:03,040
Airazor?

1145
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:06,040
I can feel Scourge!

1146
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:08,640
He's in my mind.

1147
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:20,240
Run, Elena!

1148
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:24,360
No!

1149
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:28,960
Airazor.

1150
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,000
They found us.

1151
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:35,080
Everyone, defensive positions!

1152
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:37,640
Noah, guard the key.

1153
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:40,440
Take Elena
and find someplace safe to hide.

1154
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:44,160
We must protect the humans.

1155
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:48,040
Miss me?

1156
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:50,680
Noah, Elena, get out of here!

1157
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:08,280
We have to destroy it.

1158
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:11,600
Noah!

1159
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:13,080
No!

1160
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:15,240
Don't.

1161
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:21,040
I know you want to protect
your people...

1162
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:24,000
but if you destroy that key

1163
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:26,480
our home will be lost forever.

1164
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:29,200
We do not have to choose.

1165
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:37,800
Please, Noah.

1166
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:56,320
Elena!

1167
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:02,360
Go!

1168
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:24,480
Elena!

1169
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:31,000
Wait, wait.

1170
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:33,280
Didn't I kill you already?

1171
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:36,280
No! I'm the Maximal

1172
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:38,480
that's going to rip out your spark.

1173
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:41,240
We'll see about that.

1174
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:42,720
Kill them!

1175
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:50,440
Airazor, no!

1176
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:54,560
I can't hold it back much longer.

1177
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,320
Fight it, Airazor.

1178
01:19:58,240 --> 01:19:59,760
Remember our oath...

1179
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:01,480
Primal.

1180
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:03,720
No matter the cost.

1181
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:05,920
I can't hold it back!

1182
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Airazor, no!

1183
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:19,480
Primal!

1184
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,200
It's okay.

1185
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:31,240
Do it.

1186
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:55,360
Primal.

1187
01:20:57,240 --> 01:20:58,760
No matter the cost.

1188
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:09,120
Elena! Elena, look at me.

1189
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:11,360
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

1190
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:15,600
Scourge has the key.

1191
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:01,000
Awaken, almighty Unicron.

1192
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:03,160
Your time has come.

1193
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:05,520
I am sorry, Noah.

1194
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:08,200
You were looking out for your own.

1195
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:12,760
I can't even be angry at you
for that.

1196
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:14,560
On my home world

1197
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:16,640
we believe
that the battle with darkness

1198
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:19,720
will continue 'til all are one.

1199
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:22,760
I lost sight of that.

1200
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:26,560
You fought for yours
as I fought for mine

1201
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:29,920
when we should have been fighting
the darkness together.

1202
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:35,080
Well, I ain't done fighting yet.

1203
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:42,040
All right, everybody, squad up!

1204
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:43,600
Bring it in.

1205
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:46,120
There's gotta be a way
to stop this dude.

1206
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:47,600
It's too late.

1207
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:49,840
The Transwarp
has already been activated.

1208
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:52,280
It has more energy than a supernova.

1209
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:55,680
Any interruption will ignite it
like a bomb.

1210
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:58,240
The only way to stop this process

1211
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:00,800
is an access code installed long ago

1212
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:01,960
as a safeguard.

1213
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:03,360
Okay, what's the code then?

1214
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:05,640
The code was split
along with the key.

1215
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:08,040
Sadly, the second half of that code

1216
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:09,760
died with Airazor.

1217
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:11,440
No, wait... I got it.

1218
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:12,880
The one hiding her half of the key

1219
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:14,440
it had markings in it

1220
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:16,040
just like the ones
I found in the cave

1221
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:17,120
where you hid yours.

1222
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:19,880
Together, they must complete
the access code.

1223
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,320
So we got a chance now, right?

1224
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:24,040
A slim chance.

1225
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:25,880
That is all we need

1226
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:28,800
if you will show us the way, Primal.

1227
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:32,600
All right.

1228
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:34,520
We need to move quickly.

1229
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:36,896
We have a small window
before the portal opens large enough

1230
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:38,120
for Unicron to enter.

1231
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:41,240
The bridge is girded
by a series of tunnels.

1232
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:43,760
They are too small for Maximals,
but...

1233
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:45,120
But not for humans.

1234
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:48,200
If Noah and Elena
reach the central antenna

1235
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,960
they can use the code to shut it down

1236
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:53,080
remove the Transwarp Key

1237
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,000
and close the portal

1238
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:57,400
before Unicron enters our atmosphere.

1239
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:00,000
But Scourge will be watching
our every move.

1240
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:02,040
He'll do anything to stop us
from getting the key.

1241
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:04,320
Then we bring the fight to him.

1242
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:06,480
Autobots and Maximals

1243
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:08,520
will charge the bridge together

1244
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:11,560
and lure Scourge
onto the battlefield.

1245
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:13,720
While me and Elena
sneak in through the back way.

1246
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:19,000
It sounds like
we're all going to die.

1247
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:22,680
If we are to die

1248
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:25,080
then we will die fighting

1249
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:27,040
all as one.

1250
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:42,640
This world is yours, master.

1251
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:44,840
Scourge...

1252
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:46,560
they're back.

1253
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:55,360
Prime.

1254
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:58,360
Protect the key.

1255
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:00,640
Don't let them get to the bridge.

1256
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:21,720
Maximals!

1257
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:23,000
Autobots!

1258
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:24,680
- Roll out!
- Roll out!

1259
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:38,880
Rhinox, Cheetor, maximize!

1260
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:03,256
At least the foot soldiers
took the bait.

1261
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:04,280
Yeah, but Scourge didn't.

1262
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:05,920
- He's guarding the key.
- All right.

1263
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:09,400
This should lead to the bottom
of the Transwarp control panel.

1264
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:11,040
Get the key,
get the hell out of there.

1265
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:12,120
What are you gonna do?

1266
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:14,760
I'm gonna go distract Scourge.

1267
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:16,400
No, you can't take on Scourge alone.

1268
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:18,720
Relax. I'm Mirage, remember?

1269
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:20,560
Hey.

1270
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:56,680
One, two, three!

1271
01:27:57,320 --> 01:27:58,320
There it is!

1272
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:01,480
We gotta hurry up.

1273
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:07,640
Take cover!

1274
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:11,400
Someone give me a real fight!

1275
01:28:14,120 --> 01:28:15,280
It's a fight you want?

1276
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:16,640
You got one.

1277
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:31,680
He was mine.

1278
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:34,920
Nope!

1279
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:36,680
Missed me!

1280
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:41,600
Noah, get to the key.

1281
01:28:42,040 --> 01:28:43,040
Mirage!

1282
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:45,400
What do we have here?

1283
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:47,440
Elena, go!

1284
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:52,520
Brave

1285
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:54,640
but futile.

1286
01:28:58,120 --> 01:29:00,240
Hey! Don't mess with my boy!

1287
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:23,560
Mirage.

1288
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:31,560
No one will remember
this pathetic planet.

1289
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:35,760
And no one will remember you.

1290
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:41,200
Mirage, what are you doing?

1291
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:43,280
Keeping my promise.

1292
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:44,920
Mirage, no!

1293
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:46,440
Come on, you gotta get up!

1294
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:47,680
It's okay, Noah.

1295
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:54,560
Ho... Home team.

1296
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:57,640
Home team.

1297
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:06,440
Mirage?

1298
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:11,280
Mirage.

1299
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:14,000
Kill the other human.

1300
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:51,640
Unicron.

1301
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:53,800
You fought bravely.

1302
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:58,280
But this world is already mine.

1303
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:08,400
We're too late.

1304
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:19,280
- Yo!
- Hey!

1305
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:25,600
Look!

1306
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:39,560
<i>Hey, Knuckles...</i>

1307
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:41,320
<i>are you there?</i>

1308
01:31:41,720 --> 01:31:42,720
<i>Over.</i>

1309
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:44,360
<i>Yo, Sonic.</i>

1310
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:46,520
- Kris!
<i>- Noah?</i>

1311
01:31:47,680 --> 01:31:48,680
What's going on?

1312
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:50,400
Where's Mirage?

1313
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:53,600
He... He's gone.

1314
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:55,240
<i>Gone?</i>

1315
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,000
No.

1316
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:03,320
I'm sorry, Kris.

1317
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:12,400
I'm not gonna win this one.

1318
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:15,040
But you don't lose, right?

1319
01:32:15,880 --> 01:32:17,000
I wish that were true...

1320
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:19,280
but I can't.

1321
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:26,840
<i>Yes, you can.</i>

1322
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:30,240
No.

1323
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:32,840
No, man, I'm not you.

1324
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:35,280
<i>I hate being sick.</i>

1325
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:36,600
<i>Whenever I want to give up</i>

1326
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:38,680
you're always there
telling me to keep going.

1327
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:40,800
<i>But now it's my turn.</i>

1328
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:42,640
Keep going, Noah.

1329
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:47,760
<i>You think you're a nobody
but you're the strongest guy I know.</i>

1330
01:32:49,640 --> 01:32:50,960
You guys are so cute.

1331
01:32:52,280 --> 01:32:53,280
Mirage?

1332
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:54,840
You're alive!

1333
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:57,240
Yeah, but...

1334
01:32:58,200 --> 01:32:59,920
I'm gonna need you to take the wheel.

1335
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:12,040
<i>You can do this.</i>

1336
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:18,160
<i>'Cause you're my brother.</i>

1337
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:19,720
Noah Diaz

1338
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:21,720
from Wilson Avenue

1339
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:24,920
Apartment 2-C, Brooklyn, New York.

1340
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:30,040
No names over the airwaves.

1341
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:32,120
Forget that.

1342
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:34,080
Let 'em know who you are.

1343
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:39,640
Yo, Scourge!

1344
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:45,760
Remember me?

1345
01:34:06,640 --> 01:34:09,720
You think you can take me on alone?

1346
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:14,440
He is not alone.

1347
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:00,080
I'm never leaving Brooklyn again.

1348
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:14,960
Energon.

1349
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:44,960
Prime!

1350
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:48,760
Noah!

1351
01:36:05,320 --> 01:36:07,960
I'm getting really tired
of you humans.

1352
01:36:41,160 --> 01:36:42,160
Bee!

1353
01:36:46,760 --> 01:36:47,760
You again.

1354
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:50,000
You should've stayed dead!

1355
01:37:11,120 --> 01:37:13,920
I have come here to kick ass.

1356
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:15,200
Glad to have you back.

1357
01:37:15,720 --> 01:37:17,480
Everyone guard the bridge!

1358
01:37:17,560 --> 01:37:19,560
Elena, shut it down!

1359
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:27,120
We gotta give her some cover!

1360
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:28,720
We'll clear the way.

1361
01:37:32,240 --> 01:37:33,440
That's what I'm talking about.

1362
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:35,600
Punch in an access code...

1363
01:37:35,640 --> 01:37:36,640
How hard could that be?

1364
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:42,240
Oh, you have got to be kidding me.

1365
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,960
Just you and me, Scourge.

1366
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:57,360
Let's end this once and for all.

1367
01:37:57,960 --> 01:38:00,040
Master, the reinforcements!

1368
01:38:20,280 --> 01:38:21,400
All right, I got this.

1369
01:38:21,720 --> 01:38:22,800
Let's go, Bee!

1370
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:32,400
Say hello to my little friend!

1371
01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:56,280
We gotta hurry!

1372
01:38:57,200 --> 01:38:58,200
Last one.

1373
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:01,120
Die, you ugly mother...

1374
01:39:36,200 --> 01:39:39,720
You will never see Unicron
take this world.

1375
01:39:46,920 --> 01:39:47,920
You did it!

1376
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,080
Brooklyn, baby!

1377
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:51,480
No!

1378
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:54,000
Unicron will prevail!

1379
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:55,080
Elena!

1380
01:39:59,120 --> 01:40:00,840
I've had enough!

1381
01:40:03,640 --> 01:40:07,000
Time to show you
the real power of the Prime!

1382
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:13,600
This belongs to a friend of mine!

1383
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:27,280
The panel...

1384
01:40:28,160 --> 01:40:29,240
it's destroyed.

1385
01:40:30,240 --> 01:40:31,320
I can't stop it.

1386
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:34,680
Autobots, Maximals

1387
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:36,600
retreat to safety.

1388
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:39,360
I will destroy the key myself.

1389
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:41,240
Prime! No!

1390
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:42,720
There's gotta be another way.

1391
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:44,600
Bee, protect them.

1392
01:40:53,160 --> 01:40:56,280
Your sacrifice becomes our oath.

1393
01:40:57,480 --> 01:40:58,480
Thank you...

1394
01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:00,400
my friends.

1395
01:41:05,720 --> 01:41:06,720
Bee!

1396
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:09,040
We can't leave him!

1397
01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:17,400
Everyone, on me!

1398
01:41:29,160 --> 01:41:30,360
Don't, Prime.

1399
01:41:30,680 --> 01:41:33,320
I can give you everything you want.

1400
01:41:33,680 --> 01:41:35,160
Then die.

1401
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:13,040
Noah.

1402
01:42:13,120 --> 01:42:14,160
I got you!

1403
01:42:25,240 --> 01:42:26,560
Let me go, Noah.

1404
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:27,760
Save yourself.

1405
01:42:29,880 --> 01:42:31,520
'Til all are one.

1406
01:42:51,680 --> 01:42:53,200
'Til all are one.

1407
01:43:05,400 --> 01:43:06,560
Punch it, Prime.

1408
01:43:33,080 --> 01:43:34,080
Yeah, baby!

1409
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:05,400
Unicron, is he dead?

1410
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:08,400
Trapped, but not dead.

1411
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:11,520
Evil can never be vanquished
completely.

1412
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:13,720
He could return.

1413
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:15,640
Let him come.

1414
01:44:15,960 --> 01:44:18,880
United, we will destroy him

1415
01:44:19,320 --> 01:44:20,840
once and for all.

1416
01:44:24,520 --> 01:44:26,600
<i>I am Optimus Prime</i>

1417
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:28,480
<i>leader of the Autobots.</i>

1418
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:31,600
<i>We have lost the Transwarp Key</i>

1419
01:44:31,680 --> 01:44:34,280
<i>and with it, our ability to go home.</i>

1420
01:44:37,560 --> 01:44:39,800
<i>But we have gained an ally</i>

1421
01:44:39,880 --> 01:44:42,840
<i>in our battle against
the forces of evil.</i>

1422
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:45,440
<i>Forces too powerful</i>

1423
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:48,040
<i>for any of us to defeat on our own.</i>

1424
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:52,520
<i>But together,
we might just have a chance.</i>

1425
01:45:01,680 --> 01:45:03,640
<i>I am Noah Diaz.</i>

1426
01:45:04,720 --> 01:45:05,960
<i>What is there to know about me?</i>

1427
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:08,360
<i>I was raised out in Brooklyn.</i>

1428
01:45:09,480 --> 01:45:11,200
<i>I got a little bro
who calls me Sonic.</i>

1429
01:45:11,400 --> 01:45:14,680
<i>And if I gotta help save the universe
in order to save the people I love</i>

1430
01:45:15,080 --> 01:45:16,520
<i>well, then that's what I'm gonna do.</i>

1431
01:45:46,280 --> 01:45:47,280
How you doing, sir?

1432
01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:49,440
I'm here for the job interview?

1433
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:50,760
Noah Diaz.

1434
01:45:51,120 --> 01:45:52,160
I'll tell 'em you're here.

1435
01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:55,880
<i>This Sunday on</i> 60 Minutes

1436
01:45:55,960 --> 01:45:57,120
<i>I sit down to talk</i>

1437
01:45:57,200 --> 01:45:58,920
<i>with Elena Wallace.</i>

1438
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,720
<i>She recently discovered
an underground temple</i>

1439
01:46:01,800 --> 01:46:03,600
<i>with a network of catacombs</i>

1440
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:06,440
<i>dating back to 5000 BC.</i>

1441
01:46:06,520 --> 01:46:08,176
<i>I never could've imagined
making a discovery</i>

1442
01:46:08,200 --> 01:46:09,280
<i>of this significance.</i>

1443
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:12,080
<i>So it's definitely a dream come true.</i>

1444
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:14,920
Brooklyn, baby.

1445
01:46:16,920 --> 01:46:18,336
- They're ready for you.
- Thank you, sir.

1446
01:46:18,360 --> 01:46:19,400
Elevator in the back.

1447
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:26,000
Why don't you tell me
about your strengths?

1448
01:46:26,600 --> 01:46:28,480
In addition to my experience
with electronics

1449
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:31,840
I've also been really developing
my team-building skills too.

1450
01:46:33,960 --> 01:46:34,960
Is that so?

1451
01:46:35,440 --> 01:46:37,240
Look, I'm gonna be honest with you.

1452
01:46:39,240 --> 01:46:40,320
Résumé's a little thin.

1453
01:46:40,720 --> 01:46:42,800
Yeah, well, I just recently had a job

1454
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:45,560
working internationally.

1455
01:46:46,120 --> 01:46:47,120
Oh, was that...

1456
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:51,680
- No, I don't think it's on here.
- No, it was...

1457
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
it was a short-term contract.

1458
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:56,320
Oh, well, that's cool.

1459
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:57,720
Why don't you tell me about that?

1460
01:47:01,680 --> 01:47:03,080
It was in South America.

1461
01:47:03,640 --> 01:47:05,120
So I got to work on my Spanish.

1462
01:47:05,200 --> 01:47:06,920
My mom was real happy about that.

1463
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:08,560
You know what I'm saying?
You know moms.

1464
01:47:10,120 --> 01:47:11,680
But while I was out there,
honestly, man

1465
01:47:11,720 --> 01:47:14,280
it was really just work... you know?

1466
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:18,000
That's a shame, because I hear
the food is really good in Peru.

1467
01:47:20,760 --> 01:47:22,840
Wait, I didn't mention
anything about Peru.

1468
01:47:23,400 --> 01:47:25,160
Well, that's where you were, right?

1469
01:47:25,240 --> 01:47:26,880
- I was...
- Down in Cusco?

1470
01:47:27,640 --> 01:47:30,240
With you and Elena

1471
01:47:31,080 --> 01:47:32,080
and your...

1472
01:47:32,720 --> 01:47:34,640
I don't know, call 'em friends?

1473
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:40,880
What's going on in here?

1474
01:47:42,040 --> 01:47:43,840
We know a lot about you, Mr. Diaz.

1475
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:47,080
Who are you?
Like the CIA or FBI or...

1476
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:50,200
We are a secret
government organization.

1477
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:51,520
Strictly off the books.

1478
01:47:52,120 --> 01:47:53,920
We specialize in global threats.

1479
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,240
Planetary loss prevention.
That kind of thing.

1480
01:47:57,240 --> 01:47:58,880
We're in the middle of an ongoing war

1481
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:01,480
and we'd love to have you
join the fight.

1482
01:48:02,320 --> 01:48:03,480
You and your whole team.

1483
01:48:04,720 --> 01:48:05,720
You know...

1484
01:48:06,920 --> 01:48:07,920
the big guys.

1485
01:48:08,160 --> 01:48:09,560
No idea what you're talking about.

1486
01:48:11,440 --> 01:48:12,520
That's a good answer.

1487
01:48:13,120 --> 01:48:14,120
All right.

1488
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:16,800
Either way, I want you to know

1489
01:48:17,400 --> 01:48:19,320
in lieu of the thanks
of a grateful nation

1490
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:22,121
we will be taking care
of your brother Kris's health care.

1491
01:48:22,640 --> 01:48:23,640
All of it.

1492
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:26,160
From now on, he will have 24/7 access

1493
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:27,720
to the greatest doctors in the world.

1494
01:48:27,800 --> 01:48:29,656
And these are doctors
who don't ask their patients

1495
01:48:29,680 --> 01:48:31,160
about account balances.

1496
01:48:36,760 --> 01:48:37,760
Are you serious?

1497
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:40,320
You saved the world, kid.
It's the least we can do.

1498
01:48:40,640 --> 01:48:41,720
I don't know what to say.

1499
01:48:42,160 --> 01:48:43,240
We'll work on that.

1500
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:46,880
Your brother's gonna be just fine.

1501
01:48:54,520 --> 01:48:55,760
Kris was right, by the way.

1502
01:49:05,160 --> 01:49:06,480
No names over the airwaves.

1503
01:49:09,200 --> 01:49:10,920
We could really use
someone like you, Noah.

1504
01:49:11,240 --> 01:49:12,400
Why don't you think about it?

1505
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:35,560
"G.I. Joe?"

1506
01:50:12,120 --> 01:50:14,080
Come on, baby, show me some.
Show me some.

1507
01:50:15,160 --> 01:50:16,160
That ought to do it.

1508
01:50:18,920 --> 01:50:19,920
This?

1509
01:50:20,360 --> 01:50:22,080
This is a complete waste
of your skills

1510
01:50:22,160 --> 01:50:23,480
and my expertise.

1511
01:50:23,640 --> 01:50:24,880
Think it came out pretty good.

1512
01:50:26,840 --> 01:50:28,960
Well, I guess we could call it
modern art

1513
01:50:29,040 --> 01:50:31,440
and sell it to some cats in SoHo.

1514
01:50:31,640 --> 01:50:33,200
- Nah, I'm not selling.
- What?

1515
01:50:34,120 --> 01:50:35,120
Why?

1516
01:50:36,760 --> 01:50:38,080
Is this about the 5-0 thing?

1517
01:50:39,320 --> 01:50:41,640
I told you, I did not ditch you!

1518
01:50:42,040 --> 01:50:44,440
I was running the give-and-go,
I thought you knew the play!

1519
01:50:44,520 --> 01:50:47,320
All right, let's say I did ditch you,
even though I didn't.

1520
01:50:48,080 --> 01:50:50,096
For your sake, I see your face,
let's just say I did.

1521
01:50:50,120 --> 01:50:51,776
I think all the blood, sweat
and dead presidents

1522
01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:53,440
I put into getting
these car parts for you

1523
01:50:53,720 --> 01:50:55,040
make us even Steven.

1524
01:50:55,160 --> 01:50:56,160
It's not that.

1525
01:50:57,080 --> 01:50:58,080
This car is special.

1526
01:50:58,840 --> 01:51:00,760
This car is a jigsaw puzzle

1527
01:51:00,840 --> 01:51:01,840
made of garbage!

1528
01:51:02,120 --> 01:51:03,840
Hey! I bet...

1529
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:06,200
the joint don't even start.

1530
01:51:08,840 --> 01:51:09,840
Bet?

1531
01:51:11,320 --> 01:51:12,360
Yo, Mirage.

1532
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:24,280
Yeah!

1533
01:51:24,360 --> 01:51:26,360
Your boy is back!

1534
01:51:26,440 --> 01:51:28,640
This dude said
I wasn't even gonna start!
