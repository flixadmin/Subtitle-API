1
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:02,759
I've fooled them. Job done.

2
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:06,388
So, how are things back at the Palace?

3
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:10,600
Fine, but guess
who's still living in my guest house?

4
00:46:11,644 --> 00:46:12,644
Ooh, Bin Laden?

5
00:46:14,063 --> 00:46:15,355
Yes, Osama.

6
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:18,066
Bin Laden flooding the bathroom
every time he showers...

7
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:22,028
And how hard is it to put a bath mat
down, Bin Laden?

8
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:27,033
Hey, do you remember
my favorite sports car?

9
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:28,660
You mean your Porsche?

10
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:30,245
Yes... the 911.

11
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:37,335
So I was driving my 911 near the
palace one day...

12
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:39,629
and I totally crashed!

13
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:46,010
It's ok, I've already ordered a new one.

14
00:46:46,095 --> 00:46:49,013
A brand new 9112012.

15
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:54,352
You know, while you are here, you
should try to see some of the sights...

16
00:46:54,437 --> 00:46:57,564
such as the Empire State Building...

17
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:00,525
and Yankee Stadium.

18
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:05,196
And I'd love to see the fireworks
over the Statue of Liberty.

19
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:12,370
Hey, have your old back problems been
bothering you?

20
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:16,166
It's been terrible! It got so bad that
I made myself a back brace.

21
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:20,795
- Really?
- Yes, look, I'm still wearing it.

22
00:47:22,465 --> 00:47:24,841
Hey, my English is getting good...

23
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:28,553
I bet I can count down from five
faster than you can!
