1
00:00:12,889 --> 00:00:14,265
You back off, lady.

2
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:16,683
Oh, Deon.

3
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,437
Past, present or future,
you can't run from me.

4
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:22,148
Who said I'm going to run?

5
00:00:26,277 --> 00:00:28,321
Maybe I could just snap my fingers...

6
00:00:29,906 --> 00:00:31,866
send you back
a thousand years in time.

7
00:00:33,034 --> 00:00:36,871
By the time you get back?
Oh, I'll be long gone.

8
00:00:39,415 --> 00:00:41,793
Now that is no way
to treat your big sister.

9
00:00:42,627 --> 00:00:43,627
I don't have a sister.

10
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:46,421
Yes, you do.

11
00:00:47,507 --> 00:00:48,675
Look inside yourself.

12
00:00:49,425 --> 00:00:52,011
Your stillness knows
my speed, little brother.

13
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,972
We're connected, you and I.

14
00:00:54,764 --> 00:00:55,807
I know you can feel it.

15
00:00:59,352 --> 00:01:01,896
Well, hey, maybe we are the same.

16
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,982
Okay, who cares? I don't know you.

17
00:01:04,107 --> 00:01:07,026
Yes, you do.
We were born at the same time.

18
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:08,987
What? Lady, you're nuts!

19
00:01:09,237 --> 00:01:10,780
First, you show up trying to kill me,

20
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:13,491
now you want to chat
like we're in Sunday school?

21
00:01:13,575 --> 00:01:15,785
Nah. [chuckles]
I ain't falling for that.

22
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,120
Oh, Deon.

23
00:01:18,538 --> 00:01:19,974
We may have come
into this world together,

24
00:01:19,998 --> 00:01:21,791
but this isn't my first time.

25
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:23,960
Which means...

26
00:01:24,085 --> 00:01:25,295
[Deon grunts]

27
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,547
I could kill you at any moment.

28
00:01:28,798 --> 00:01:29,799
And I still might.

29
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:33,094
Then do it or get out of my face.

30
00:01:37,056 --> 00:01:38,656
[Speed Force as Nora Allen]
You're right.

31
00:01:39,475 --> 00:01:40,602
I don't want you dead...

32
00:01:42,395 --> 00:01:43,438
but I do want your help.

33
00:01:47,108 --> 00:01:48,526
You and I have a common enemy.

34
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:51,863
Our father, Barry Allen, rejected me.

35
00:01:53,072 --> 00:01:54,699
Just like he rejected you.

36
00:01:57,952 --> 00:01:58,952
Tell me something.

37
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:04,167
How does that make you feel?

38
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,831
[Alexa] Wait, let me get this straight.

39
00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:27,649
I'm a Force of Nature...

40
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,111
Barry's the Flash
and you two birthed me.

41
00:02:32,195 --> 00:02:35,073
[chuckling] That makes you, what?
My parents?

42
00:02:36,115 --> 00:02:37,659
Something like that.

43
00:02:39,494 --> 00:02:40,662
And I have three siblings,

44
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:43,998
one who just tried to kill me.

45
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:46,417
[Caitlin] Technically, Alexa,
she did kill you,

46
00:02:46,501 --> 00:02:50,004
but your biometrics are stable,
so I think you're fine.

47
00:02:50,505 --> 00:02:52,924
Wait, how did you
bring me back anyway?

48
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:58,888
We don't actually know.

49
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:01,391
But according to my initial tests,

50
00:03:01,516 --> 00:03:05,103
the three of you share the same
bio-kinetic genome sequence.

51
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:08,314
Kind of like how a parent
and their child share the same DNA.

52
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:11,984
Exactly, except we're talking
about cosmic DNA.

53
00:03:12,068 --> 00:03:15,947
So you can sense their cells
on a quantum level, and vice versa.

54
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:19,826
So they can sense one another?
That is so damn cute.

55
00:03:20,535 --> 00:03:22,203
Wait, if we're all connected,

56
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:24,163
can't the other Forces
sense each other, too?

57
00:03:25,415 --> 00:03:28,000
- If Nora finds them before we do...
- She's gonna kill them.

58
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,938
All right, well, where are we
with finding Deon and Psych?

59
00:03:30,962 --> 00:03:33,089
Chester and I are working
on a tracking system

60
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:36,008
to locate Deon's temporal isotopes
across timelines.

61
00:03:36,092 --> 00:03:39,429
I'm monitoring the data while he's
out there setting up the sensors.

62
00:03:39,512 --> 00:03:41,013
And <i>The Citizen</i>
is looking into Psych.

63
00:03:41,097 --> 00:03:43,516
We're going to see if we can ID
his human identity.

64
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,101
If we can do that, we can find him.

65
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:47,186
Well, we better do it fast.

66
00:03:47,854 --> 00:03:49,772
I've been seeing intermittent spikes

67
00:03:49,856 --> 00:03:52,817
of Nora's isotopic signature
all across the city,

68
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,988
and there's been a ton of reports
of spontaneous lightning.

69
00:03:57,572 --> 00:03:59,115
Your firstborn is pissed.

70
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:00,658
She's going to come after me again.

71
00:04:00,742 --> 00:04:02,493
And if she does, we will protect you.

72
00:04:02,577 --> 00:04:04,537
How? You couldn't the last time.

73
00:04:04,662 --> 00:04:06,330
She's not going to this time.

74
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,250
We're gonna train you
to control your powers.

75
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:12,795
Wait, you want me
to control that monster?

76
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,257
Think about it. Nora needed me
to help to take you down.

77
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:19,177
If you could control your powers,

78
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,863
I don't think she'd be able
to hurt you again.

79
00:04:20,887 --> 00:04:25,391
What if I hurt you or kill
someone else during this training?

80
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,062
I can't hurt anyone else.

81
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,523
We'll make sure you don't.

82
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:34,941
Let us help you.

83
00:04:42,742 --> 00:04:43,742
[Cisco] You leaving?

84
00:04:43,785 --> 00:04:45,536
Yeah, Iris put me on Psych duty.

85
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:48,039
It is an all-hands-on-deck
kind of day.

86
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:52,043
Yeah, this whole
fighting Big Bads thing?

87
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:53,286
Definitely not gonna miss it.

88
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:54,754
[laughs]

89
00:04:55,046 --> 00:04:57,340
Hey, what do you think about Miami?

90
00:04:58,216 --> 00:05:01,511
Great mojitos, excellent NBA team.

91
00:05:01,594 --> 00:05:04,096
What, are you thinking about
booking a vacation, like, now?

92
00:05:04,222 --> 00:05:07,099
No, I meant to live
after we leave Central City.

93
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:10,061
I've been submitting my work
to a few art galleries,

94
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:12,355
and this one in South Beach
is interested.

95
00:05:12,438 --> 00:05:14,148
Plus, I do love a good mojito.

96
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,192
You're already job hunting.

97
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:18,069
Yeah. Aren't you?

98
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:21,155
Mm-hm.

99
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:24,659
Okay. Well, we should probably
tell the team soon.

100
00:05:24,742 --> 00:05:27,203
I've got to give Iris enough time
to find a new photographer.

101
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:28,871
- Bye.
- Bye.

102
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:39,423
Fine. Just call me
when the deal's done.

103
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:44,929
[Psych in sing-song voice] Caleb.

104
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:47,265
[chuckles] That's my name, you idiot.

105
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:53,145
[Psych in sing-song voice] Caleb.

106
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:58,650
Who said that?

107
00:06:00,278 --> 00:06:01,278
Who's here?

108
00:06:01,904 --> 00:06:03,239
[Psych] Caleb!

109
00:06:03,698 --> 00:06:05,618
Seems like your short game
still needs some work.

110
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,535
[Psych laughing]

111
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:10,495
Who are you?

112
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:13,040
- And what do you want?
- [Psych] Aw.

113
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,251
You don't remember me?

114
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,460
Well...

115
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:22,675
Let's see if I can't jog your memory.

116
00:06:25,428 --> 00:06:26,428
Bashir?

117
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:28,389
How are you doing this?

118
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:29,724
It's kind of a long story.

119
00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:31,976
To be honest with you,
it's been a bit of a nightmare.

120
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:34,145
How about I share it with you?

121
00:06:38,608 --> 00:06:39,608
[screams]

122
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:59,337
That was Caleb Fairweather,
the billionaire tech guy.

123
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,421
What happened to him?

124
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:01,624
According to the paramedics,

125
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:05,259
mental distress and symptoms
consistent with narcolepsy.

126
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:07,219
That was the mayor's office.

127
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:12,433
It turns out that Caleb
is the fourth billionaire today

128
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:13,516
they found like this.

129
00:07:14,644 --> 00:07:15,644
Hold on.

130
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:21,108
[chiming]

131
00:07:21,192 --> 00:07:24,403
Yeah, I'm picking up a ton
of electrochemical isotopes in here.

132
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,197
Caleb was attacked by Psych?

133
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:27,738
I don't get it.

134
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,284
You both were attacked by Psych
and you didn't end up like that.

135
00:07:30,368 --> 00:07:31,786
- [phone vibrating]
- No.

136
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,455
I'm needed at C.C.P.D.

137
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:36,290
Let me know if you find out anything.

138
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:52,765
What are you thinking?

139
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:56,894
Well, we both assumed Psych
had an axe to grind with the system,

140
00:07:56,978 --> 00:07:59,730
because he was attacking
banks and the stock market.

141
00:07:59,814 --> 00:08:01,607
But now he's going
after individual people.

142
00:08:01,691 --> 00:08:04,235
- Why the change?
- Yeah, I know. Feels personal.

143
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:08,280
Maybe there's something here
that explains the escalation.

144
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:15,705
I'm guessing that's not
Caleb's college chess club.

145
00:08:15,788 --> 00:08:16,788
No.

146
00:08:17,373 --> 00:08:19,166
More like an Ivy League society.

147
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:21,584
Wait.

148
00:08:22,086 --> 00:08:25,840
My dad did say that four other
wealthy targets were attacked today.

149
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,884
If Psych is targeting
people in this group, then...

150
00:08:30,553 --> 00:08:32,304
Start training Alexa
as fast as you can.

151
00:08:32,388 --> 00:08:34,708
I'm going to try and figure out
who's next on Psych's list.

152
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:43,858
[knocking on door]

153
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:46,192
Kramer?

154
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:49,071
I thought you were headed upstate.

155
00:08:49,405 --> 00:08:51,115
As a result of the Frost case,

156
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:53,576
the governor wants me
to stick around a bit longer.

157
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:54,785
Have a seat, Captain.

158
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,084
I'm trying to find
the source of this city's

159
00:09:02,168 --> 00:09:04,086
meta-criminal problem.
And I need your help.

160
00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:06,630
There seem to be a whole lot of cases

161
00:09:06,714 --> 00:09:09,383
where meta-criminals
simply disappear around here.

162
00:09:09,467 --> 00:09:10,968
Like this Rainbow Raider.

163
00:09:12,428 --> 00:09:15,222
One minute he's in C.C.P.D. custody,
the next, missing.

164
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:17,557
Any thoughts?

165
00:09:17,892 --> 00:09:19,268
None whatsoever.

166
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,895
Okay, then.

167
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,356
Who else worked these cases?

168
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:27,443
Patty Spivot. Reassigned.

169
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,447
Julian Albert. Also reassigned.

170
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:37,620
Hm. Barry Allen's still here.

171
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:40,413
Can you do me a favor?

172
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,290
Send him in.

173
00:09:42,792 --> 00:09:44,210
Maybe he knows something we don't.

174
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:46,252
He's on a case.

175
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:53,844
I'll see if I can pull him off.

176
00:09:54,804 --> 00:09:55,804
Thank you.

177
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,660
[Cisco] Don't worry. This force field
can handle just about anything.

178
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:12,363
Speedsters, futuristic meta-villains.

179
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:13,656
You've done this before?

180
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:16,784
[laughs] Oh, yeah.

181
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:18,244
But you should know

182
00:10:18,369 --> 00:10:21,831
I've reinforced this baby
with inverse surge capabilities.

183
00:10:21,914 --> 00:10:25,376
The harder you push against it,
the stronger it's going to get.

184
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,795
Even Fuerza
can't fight herself, right?

185
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:29,462
<i>Fuerza...</i>

186
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:31,465
You named it "Strength"?

187
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:35,970
I guess that makes sense. [sighs]

188
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:39,931
What now?

189
00:10:40,266 --> 00:10:41,517
You initiate a change.

190
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:44,728
The key is to focus,

191
00:10:44,812 --> 00:10:47,231
control the transformation
into Fuerza from the start.

192
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:50,192
So try to stay calm when I change?

193
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:52,653
[scoffs] Are you gonna
teach me to meditate?

194
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,756
I mean, it's really just
about your breathing.

195
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,115
Focus on that while you transform

196
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:58,200
and we'll keep track
of the physiological effects.

197
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:00,119
You sure I'm ready for this?

198
00:11:00,578 --> 00:11:03,098
If Nora shows up again, you need
to be able to protect yourself.

199
00:11:04,707 --> 00:11:05,708
We'll go slow.

200
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:14,049
[whirring]

201
00:11:21,182 --> 00:11:22,933
[sputtering]
I don't think I can do this.

202
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:26,854
Yes, you can. Just try to remember
how you felt the last time.

203
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:28,355
I can't.

204
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,565
Alexa, you have to.

205
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,497
[Iris West] Excuse me, Ms. LaSalle?

206
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:48,125
Hi. I'm Iris West-Allen
with <i>The Central City Citizen...</i>

207
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:50,020
If you're looking for a quote
on our recent merger,

208
00:11:50,044 --> 00:11:51,921
you'll have to contact publicity.

209
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:53,315
[Iris West] No, actually,
we're here because

210
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:55,139
you were the president
of the League of Lions.

211
00:11:57,885 --> 00:11:59,637
Is this for that alumni newsletter?

212
00:12:00,054 --> 00:12:03,849
Here's a quote. I'm wealthier
than the whole League combined now.

213
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:04,975
Ms. LaSalle, please.

214
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:08,020
There is a meta-human that is
targeting members of that League.

215
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:10,898
And four of your Richie Rich friends
have already been attacked.

216
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:13,627
We believe you and the other man
in this photo are the next victims.

217
00:12:13,651 --> 00:12:15,051
If you could just tell us his name.

218
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:16,861
Lucas Sharpe.

219
00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:19,740
He's into apps
and alternative energy sources.

220
00:12:20,074 --> 00:12:21,242
Bit of a do-gooder.

221
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:24,578
[Psych speaking Latin]

222
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:28,540
[in English]
Prosperity equals power.

223
00:12:28,624 --> 00:12:32,002
And judging by this empire
that you've built up for yourself,

224
00:12:32,086 --> 00:12:35,923
it appears you followed
the League's motto to a tee, Naomi.

225
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,258
Congratulations.

226
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:41,971
I know that voice.

227
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:45,474
Smashing costume, Bashir.

228
00:12:48,686 --> 00:12:51,006
It's not working. I don't know
how to bring that thing out.

229
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:52,564
It's because you're holding back.

230
00:12:52,815 --> 00:12:54,233
[alarm blaring]

231
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:56,568
I've got isotopes downtown!

232
00:12:58,988 --> 00:13:00,239
[whooshing]

233
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:02,616
[Psych] So, Naomi...

234
00:13:03,284 --> 00:13:05,286
I've been catching up
with the old gang.

235
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:08,998
Swapping stories.
It's been a lot of fun for me.

236
00:13:09,081 --> 00:13:11,125
And now it's your turn.

237
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:14,586
Last time I saw you, you got
thrown out of the yacht club

238
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,547
because you couldn't pay your dues.

239
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:17,797
[Psych] It's true.

240
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,134
The regatta life was never for me.

241
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:21,677
I was so right about you.

242
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,239
The others thought
you deserved a chance,

243
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:26,265
but I knew you'd never fit in.

244
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:28,766
Let me guess.

245
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,395
You're broke again
and now you want another handout?

246
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:34,898
Sorry, Bashir. You want help?

247
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:37,026
Help yourself.

248
00:13:37,443 --> 00:13:39,945
- [Psych] Don't mind if I do.
- Bashir!

249
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:41,447
You don't have to do this.

250
00:13:41,739 --> 00:13:44,658
[Psych chuckles] Oh, yes, I really do.

251
00:13:49,038 --> 00:13:50,289
[Naomi screaming]

252
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:58,589
[Psych] Whew. Back for another
round, huh, Flash?

253
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:01,008
Psych, you need to listen to me.

254
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:02,676
You're in danger.

255
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,612
There are other Forces
out there who are trying to...

256
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:05,636
[Psych] Boring!

257
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:11,727
[grunts]

258
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:17,691
[Psych] So you're Dad?

259
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,192
[Psych laughs]

260
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:21,987
Life is just full
of little surprises, isn't it?

261
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:27,368
[gasps]

262
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,919
Your scans show pattern bruising
from where Psych...

263
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:39,797
Bashir attacked you.

264
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,257
What did he show you this time?

265
00:14:42,383 --> 00:14:45,302
He didn't show me anything,
but his powers are growing.

266
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:47,012
I mean, somehow he was able to

267
00:14:47,096 --> 00:14:51,892
manifest tentacles
that could move as fast as me.

268
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:57,523
So we've got a fifth comatose
billionaire in the hospital

269
00:14:57,606 --> 00:15:02,027
and an evil magenta
Sage guru with tentacles?

270
00:15:02,111 --> 00:15:04,071
Magentacles, if you will.

271
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:07,658
We're gonna have to
change up our plan, I think.

272
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:10,619
Well, Iris is trying to locate
Bashir's final target.

273
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:11,745
We need to be ready.

274
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:14,456
Right. To do what exactly?

275
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:18,168
I mean, maybe I'm not strong enough
to stop Bashir.

276
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:19,503
But Fuerza is.

277
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:22,464
Wait, you want me to fight him?

278
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:25,426
Hey, uh...

279
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:27,845
Just long enough to subdue Bashir,

280
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:30,139
so hopefully we can
get through to him.

281
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:31,974
What if I accidentally kill him?

282
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:34,893
Well, you won't if you can get
a handle on your powers,

283
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:37,020
which is why we've got
to continue your training.

284
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:40,315
Cisco, are the isotopic
arc radiators still functional?

285
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:43,318
They need a couple tweaks, but yeah.

286
00:15:43,444 --> 00:15:46,113
I'm sorry,
you want to force Fuerza out?

287
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:49,741
Yeah, yeah.
I mean, we're running out of time.

288
00:15:49,825 --> 00:15:52,870
Barry, you can't push Fuerza out
until Alexa's ready.

289
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:54,246
It's too dangerous.

290
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:56,747
Alexa.

291
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:02,171
This is about more than
protecting yourself from Nora now.

292
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:05,924
If Bashir uses these new powers
on the city, people will get hurt.

293
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:09,511
I know you're scared,
but we still need your help.

294
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,390
And this Bashir guy, he's really bad?

295
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:16,351
He's pretty much the worst.

296
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:19,188
[sighs]

297
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:21,022
Okay.

298
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:27,904
[Iris West] Bashir Malik.

299
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:30,574
His name was listed on
the League of Lions' member page.

300
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:35,329
Class of '08. He is the adoptive son
of Adrita and Paul Malik,

301
00:16:35,454 --> 00:16:37,122
owners of Malik Hotels.

302
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:39,500
He was a rich kid, but it says here

303
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:42,419
the Maliks died in a plane crash
13 years ago.

304
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:46,173
He was orphaned twice?
First by his birth parents

305
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:48,133
and then by his adoptive parents.

306
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:49,258
And it gets worse.

307
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:52,638
When the Maliks' plane went down,
there were $50 million in debt.

308
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:54,681
They were fleeing the country
for tax evasion,

309
00:16:54,765 --> 00:16:56,350
and they left Bashir behind.

310
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:59,144
And I thought my family
was messed up.

311
00:16:59,228 --> 00:17:00,812
That's why he hates his parents.

312
00:17:00,896 --> 00:17:04,107
They abandoned him,
and they weren't the only ones.

313
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:06,151
Naomi told him he never belonged.

314
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:08,796
You think when he went broke,
his friends just bailed on him, too?

315
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,572
Yeah, that's why he's targeting them.

316
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:12,616
He felt burned by his parents,
his friends

317
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:13,909
and the system that made him.

318
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:15,661
Now he's out for revenge.

319
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:18,914
[sighs] So who's next on the list?

320
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:21,291
Lucas Sharpe.
I ran his picture and got a hit.

321
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,043
He wasn't at his home or his work,

322
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:25,271
and all of his social media accounts
were recently deleted.

323
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:26,380
He's on the run.

324
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,610
I called Cisco. S.T.A.R.'s
search protocols are up and running.

325
00:17:29,675 --> 00:17:32,678
But, Iris, even if we find Lucas,
what's our plan?

326
00:17:32,803 --> 00:17:34,531
I mean, you've tried talking
to Bashir twice now,

327
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:35,639
and it still hasn't worked.

328
00:17:36,265 --> 00:17:39,309
Well, because
I didn't know what to say.

329
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:41,395
I think I was trying to be
a mother figure

330
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:42,980
when I should have been a journalist.

331
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:45,440
Getting all of the information
before running a story.

332
00:17:45,524 --> 00:17:47,109
And do you think there's more to his?

333
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:49,695
Yeah. We need to dig deeper.

334
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:06,461
[locks clicking]

335
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:12,694
[Kramer] Find what you're looking for?

336
00:18:14,845 --> 00:18:18,807
I checked out the armament delivery
you signed for this morning.

337
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:21,685
Seeing as I didn't authorize it.

338
00:18:23,312 --> 00:18:26,982
These bullets contain
the meta-human cure, don't they?

339
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:29,109
Thirty cc's each, yes.

340
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:32,529
If meta-humans are threatening
the public good,

341
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:34,823
we need to be able to protect
the people of this city.

342
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:35,906
This is illegal.

343
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:39,870
No, there's just
no precedent for them. Yet.

344
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:42,581
You didn't get the results
you wanted in court,

345
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:44,625
so now you're trying to figure out
another way

346
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,335
to eliminate meta-criminals.

347
00:18:46,418 --> 00:18:48,920
Meta-criminals are dangerous,
Captain.

348
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:51,590
The people of this city can see it.
Why can't you?

349
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:54,635
The last time we talked,
I asked you to make sure

350
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:56,261
you're on the right side of the line.

351
00:18:56,345 --> 00:18:58,865
Now you're going to go out there
and shoot up metas with the cure?

352
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:02,517
When it comes to meta-human affairs,
I have full authority

353
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:05,771
to use extreme measures
in emergency combat situations.

354
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:10,692
This is still my precinct.
Around here, we take the time

355
00:19:10,776 --> 00:19:14,905
to deescalate the situation
before it becomes combative.

356
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:16,823
That's what this precinct did,

357
00:19:16,907 --> 00:19:18,575
and your city hasn't been safe.

358
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:20,827
So we're doing things my way now.

359
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:23,246
I don't think so.
I'll contact the Governor's office...

360
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,915
The Governor authorized the order.

361
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,670
I'm still hoping that we can
work together on this, Captain.

362
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:31,713
But this is the new line now.

363
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:34,091
Figure out which side of
it you're on

364
00:19:35,384 --> 00:19:36,384
and let me know.

365
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:47,644
All right, remember,

366
00:19:47,646 --> 00:19:50,148
the radiators release isotopes
that'll bring out Fuerza.

367
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:51,650
So you don't have to do anything.

368
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:54,152
Just try to stay conscious
during the transformation.

369
00:19:54,236 --> 00:19:56,279
That's the first step
to maintaining control.

370
00:19:56,405 --> 00:19:57,485
If I start to lose control,

371
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:59,091
promise me
you'll turn these things off.

372
00:19:59,658 --> 00:20:00,867
Of course we will.

373
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:03,578
Also, I've got backup.

374
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:05,913
You ready?

375
00:20:06,665 --> 00:20:07,791
[whirring]

376
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:11,336
Releasing isotopic waves... now.

377
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:13,505
[groans]

378
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:17,592
Remember, Alexa, you're in control.

379
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:20,345
[voice shaking]
I can't. I don't want to do it.

380
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:21,763
You can.

381
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:27,269
[distorted]
I said, I don't want to do this.

382
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:29,539
- [rapid beeping]
- Guys, her biometrics are spiking,

383
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:31,124
I'm going to reduce
her isotopic exposure.

384
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:34,860
Don't. Alexa, you can do this.

385
00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:50,542
[alarm blaring]

386
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,169
Uh, that's a problem.

387
00:20:58,008 --> 00:20:59,652
[Cisco] Guys,
she's getting blue and angry.

388
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:02,012
It'll take 30 seconds
for the isotopic effects to wear off.

389
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:04,741
[Cisco] We don't have 30 seconds.
She's overloading the force field.

390
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:06,576
If we don't shut it down,
this thing's going to blow

391
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,600
and then we're all toast.

392
00:21:08,894 --> 00:21:10,061
[growling]

393
00:21:11,396 --> 00:21:12,522
I'm shutting it down now.

394
00:21:18,904 --> 00:21:20,280
[roars]

395
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:22,574
[grunts]

396
00:21:29,331 --> 00:21:30,331
Hey.

397
00:21:34,503 --> 00:21:36,296
I told you I couldn't control it.

398
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:47,307
[door opens]

399
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:51,269
Is he gonna be all right?

400
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:53,273
He needs to rest,
but he'll make a full recovery.

401
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:56,024
All right,
we should get back to work.

402
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:00,153
Barry, why don't we take a break
from training?

403
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:06,409
Look, I know this is a setback,
but we can't stop.

404
00:22:06,868 --> 00:22:07,868
Lives are on the line.

405
00:22:08,078 --> 00:22:09,538
Don't you know what just happened?

406
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:12,892
- We can't train that thing.
- Alexa, we don't have a choice...

407
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:16,169
You don't. I do.
And I won't be your weapon.

408
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:20,298
I'm done with this,
and I am done with you.

409
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:21,883
- Wait, Alexa...
- Barry.

410
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:23,260
- What?
- What are you doing?

411
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:24,928
She needs to train.

412
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:28,598
She just found out two days ago that
she has this Force inside of her.

413
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:30,350
She needs time to process that.

414
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:32,310
Look, I'm trying to teach her
how to survive.

415
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:34,563
- Well, she's not ready.
- Well, she has to be.

416
00:22:34,855 --> 00:22:37,148
All right? Look, it's my fault
that Nora wants her dead.

417
00:22:37,232 --> 00:22:39,232
That means it's my responsibility
to keep her safe.

418
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:40,878
Training her is the only way
I know how to do that.

419
00:22:40,902 --> 00:22:43,655
I am not saying that we don't
train her when she's ready.

420
00:22:43,738 --> 00:22:46,700
Right now, what Alexa needs
from you is patience.

421
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:48,285
[sighs in exasperation]

422
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:52,706
When you first got your powers,
Thawne spent months training you.

423
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,375
Your greatest enemy
was more patient with you

424
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:58,044
than your being
with your own... daughter.

425
00:22:59,754 --> 00:23:00,754
Think about that.

426
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:03,499
While I try and stop you
from pushing another kid away.

427
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:12,159
[Joe] Kramer's going to start a war.

428
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:14,227
She's going after
every meta with a record.

429
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:17,105
And she's being smart about it.
She's doing everything by the book.

430
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:19,608
Oh, you almost respect her, don't you?

431
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:21,693
I know that there is a good cop
in there somewhere

432
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:24,863
that cares about the safety
of people. But not like this.

433
00:23:25,614 --> 00:23:26,781
What's all this?

434
00:23:26,865 --> 00:23:30,285
These are all the purchases
made by Kramer on behalf of C.C.P.D.

435
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:35,040
I also have former case files coming
from Keystone, Gotham, Coast City

436
00:23:35,123 --> 00:23:36,249
later today.

437
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:40,003
It's about time
somebody investigated her.

438
00:23:40,295 --> 00:23:44,716
[sighs] Joe, I just
I went up against Kramer.

439
00:23:44,966 --> 00:23:46,551
That woman knows
how to handle herself.

440
00:23:46,635 --> 00:23:48,303
Plus, she's got
the Governor on her side.

441
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:51,222
What are you saying?
I should back down?

442
00:23:51,348 --> 00:23:54,434
Joe, it has got to be her choice.

443
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:56,853
Otherwise, she is never
going to back down.

444
00:23:57,187 --> 00:24:01,191
So until that happens, what are you
gonna do to help her get there?

445
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:08,007
[Kamilla] Should you be
working right now?

446
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:08,949
You're still recovering.

447
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:11,534
I'm just a little sore,
I'll be all right.

448
00:24:14,496 --> 00:24:15,496
[Kamilla] Oh, my gosh.

449
00:24:15,914 --> 00:24:18,333
That gallery in Miami wants
to schedule an interview.

450
00:24:20,085 --> 00:24:22,253
And you don't seem that excited.

451
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:28,885
Did you know that I'm qualified

452
00:24:28,969 --> 00:24:34,766
for 7,685 jobs in the US alone?

453
00:24:35,225 --> 00:24:36,977
Eighty-three of them in Miami.

454
00:24:37,727 --> 00:24:44,067
And trust me, I know how lucky I am
to be able to say that.

455
00:24:46,611 --> 00:24:47,904
[sighs]

456
00:24:47,988 --> 00:24:49,489
But if I'm being honest,

457
00:24:51,408 --> 00:24:54,703
I have no clue what I'm supposed
to be doing right now.

458
00:25:02,085 --> 00:25:05,714
I never told anyone this,
but when we were at Cleary Capital,

459
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:10,260
and Psych whammied me
and Barry and Frost

460
00:25:10,385 --> 00:25:12,929
and he showed us
our worst nightmares,

461
00:25:13,054 --> 00:25:14,597
you know what I saw?

462
00:25:15,473 --> 00:25:20,103
I saw myself 40 years from now,

463
00:25:21,396 --> 00:25:23,648
I was still working at S.T.A.R. Labs.

464
00:25:24,649 --> 00:25:26,568
And that's a bad thing?

465
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,404
No, not entirely.

466
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:35,744
I mean, I've learned a lot here,
and I've made family here.

467
00:25:38,663 --> 00:25:39,914
But in this nightmare...

468
00:25:43,126 --> 00:25:44,669
everybody had moved on.

469
00:25:46,755 --> 00:25:47,755
And I hadn't.

470
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:52,217
It was just me.

471
00:25:53,553 --> 00:25:56,806
And I felt this insane regret,

472
00:25:57,182 --> 00:26:00,393
not even trying to do anything else
with my career.

473
00:26:04,064 --> 00:26:05,482
I don't want that future.

474
00:26:13,907 --> 00:26:18,495
So, what the hell
am I supposed to do?

475
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:22,081
Babe,

476
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:25,085
I know this is a big decision.

477
00:26:26,711 --> 00:26:28,379
But you don't have
to make it right now.

478
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:34,260
Just give it time.
The right job will find you.

479
00:26:50,068 --> 00:26:52,445
I know it seems safer,

480
00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:54,656
but running away
won't solve anything.

481
00:26:54,739 --> 00:26:58,159
I don't have a choice.
When you turned that machine off,

482
00:26:58,243 --> 00:27:00,745
I could feel that monster
fighting against me

483
00:27:00,829 --> 00:27:04,249
as I was changing back.
It wanted to stay out.

484
00:27:06,376 --> 00:27:08,294
What if I never control it?

485
00:27:09,212 --> 00:27:11,256
You will. Just like I did.

486
00:27:12,924 --> 00:27:14,551
Do you know the meta-human Frost?

487
00:27:15,844 --> 00:27:17,846
She and I used to share a body.

488
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:21,641
When Frost first surfaced,
she did horrible things,

489
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:22,724
and I was terrified.

490
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:26,396
I tried to control her
with meta-cuffs.

491
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:29,399
I didn't even try to understand her.

492
00:27:29,941 --> 00:27:33,236
But then, after a while, I realized

493
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:35,989
that there was good
inside that other part of me.

494
00:27:36,698 --> 00:27:38,158
How'd you do that?

495
00:27:38,783 --> 00:27:40,743
By talking to Frost. With this.

496
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:44,455
It's a mental activity dampener.

497
00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:47,667
It uses neural pathways to connect
multiple consciousnesses.

498
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:49,377
It's how we talked to each other.

499
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:52,130
- I could hear that thing in my head?
- Mm-hm.

500
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:57,468
It will take time, but I think
that's just what you two need.

501
00:27:58,761 --> 00:28:01,055
Or maybe you just want me
to start training again.

502
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:04,100
[Barry] Forget the training.

503
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,811
I should have listened to you

504
00:28:07,854 --> 00:28:09,397
when you said you weren't ready.

505
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:12,734
I wanted to say I'm sorry.

506
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:17,155
If you need more time
to process this, you got it.

507
00:28:17,322 --> 00:28:19,073
Whatever you want to do, we'll do it.

508
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:22,869
Thanks for saying that.

509
00:28:24,662 --> 00:28:27,457
I guess what I want to do is...

510
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:32,003
try to get in sync
with my other half.

511
00:28:37,258 --> 00:28:38,718
[alarm blaring]

512
00:28:42,597 --> 00:28:44,700
Satellites are picking up
Lucas Sharpe's license plate.

513
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:46,309
He's headed north on I-95.

514
00:28:46,517 --> 00:28:47,810
[engine revving]

515
00:28:50,188 --> 00:28:51,188
[Allegra] Hang on.

516
00:28:52,649 --> 00:28:55,610
We've got Bashir's Force signal
heading Sharpe's way, and fast.

517
00:29:01,699 --> 00:29:03,243
Fill the jet. I'm ten minutes out.

518
00:29:12,502 --> 00:29:14,379
[tires screeching]

519
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,050
[panting]

520
00:29:29,018 --> 00:29:30,018
Hi, Lucas.

521
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:37,359
Bashir?

522
00:29:38,069 --> 00:29:42,615
Oh, my God,
where have you been all these years?

523
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,243
That's an interesting question.

524
00:29:46,327 --> 00:29:48,121
You know, I guess
I could have been out there

525
00:29:48,204 --> 00:29:49,372
trying to find myself,

526
00:29:49,956 --> 00:29:52,583
traveling to Prague
or the Amalfi Coast.

527
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:55,128
Really living the dream
like all of you did.

528
00:29:56,004 --> 00:29:57,380
But I couldn't do that...

529
00:29:58,298 --> 00:30:02,969
because I couldn't get my friends
out of my mind.

530
00:30:04,178 --> 00:30:06,639
I tried to get in touch.
I was worried about you.

531
00:30:06,764 --> 00:30:08,766
You did? Oh, that's so sweet.

532
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,286
I'm sure you thought
about me every day.

533
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:13,646
Sure, sure, sure. Hey, listen.
Now that I've got you here,

534
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:16,899
could I pick your brain
about something?

535
00:30:17,692 --> 00:30:19,068
[distorted] For old time's sake.

536
00:30:27,785 --> 00:30:30,105
Guys, Lucas Sharpe is the last person
on Bashir's hit list.

537
00:30:30,163 --> 00:30:32,891
- And if Bashir gets to him first...
- [Iris West] There's one more thing.

538
00:30:32,915 --> 00:30:34,751
There's more to Bashir's story
than we knew.

539
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:36,501
If you can get him to listen,

540
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:38,022
then I can tell you
what to say to him.

541
00:30:38,046 --> 00:30:40,131
- Okay, stay on comms.
- I'm coming with you.

542
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:41,716
Alexa, you don't have to.

543
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:43,384
I know. I want to.

544
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:52,727
Look, Bash. Come on. We were friends.

545
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:54,290
Whatever you want,
we can work it out.

546
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:57,607
Oh, Lucas, you always were the optimist

547
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:01,903
in our little cabal
of spoiled rich brats.

548
00:31:02,612 --> 00:31:04,332
Of course, that's not
going to help you now.

549
00:31:04,906 --> 00:31:06,115
No, no, no, please, please.

550
00:31:06,449 --> 00:31:07,992
[Psych] You couldn't stop the others,

551
00:31:08,201 --> 00:31:11,079
so instead you watched them
destroy my life.

552
00:31:11,162 --> 00:31:13,539
That makes you just as guilty.

553
00:31:13,623 --> 00:31:19,170
Now you're going to pay,
just like them!

554
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,716
[in sing-song voice] Flash.

555
00:31:25,009 --> 00:31:27,011
Why don't you come out
and show yourself?

556
00:31:27,762 --> 00:31:29,097
Are you afraid?

557
00:31:29,806 --> 00:31:31,557
Do you fear me, Flash?

558
00:31:33,142 --> 00:31:34,268
Ah.

559
00:31:37,397 --> 00:31:39,482
You know, it doesn't matter
where you stashed him.

560
00:31:39,565 --> 00:31:41,234
I will hunt Lucas down.

561
00:31:41,442 --> 00:31:43,903
No, you won't.
We won't let you hurt him.

562
00:31:44,362 --> 00:31:46,531
[Psych] We? Who's this?

563
00:31:48,241 --> 00:31:51,035
Oh, I have a baby sister.

564
00:31:51,702 --> 00:31:52,702
Don't care.

565
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:57,125
Bashir, listen. Iris and I know
what your parents did to you,

566
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,252
but you can't keep
punishing the world for it.

567
00:31:59,335 --> 00:32:00,795
Actually, yes, I can.

568
00:32:02,797 --> 00:32:03,965
[grunts]

[beeping]

570
00:32:16,978 --> 00:32:18,563
I don't know if you can hear me,

571
00:32:19,397 --> 00:32:20,898
but I'm not afraid of you anymore.

572
00:32:21,649 --> 00:32:22,775
What if Alexa's not ready?

573
00:32:22,859 --> 00:32:24,902
Fuerza might be the muscle,
but after everything

574
00:32:24,986 --> 00:32:27,238
she's been through,
I think Alexa might be stronger.

575
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:30,700
[speaking Spanish]

[Fuerza roaring]

578
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,420
Alexa?

579
00:32:45,047 --> 00:32:47,175
[distorted] And Fuerza, together.

580
00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:50,761
[Psych] You are a very big baby sister.

581
00:32:51,846 --> 00:32:53,306
Not that it's going to matter.

582
00:32:55,183 --> 00:32:56,559
[roaring]

583
00:33:18,331 --> 00:33:20,958
Bashir, you don't have to fight us.

584
00:33:21,042 --> 00:33:22,668
[Psych] Yes, I do, Dad.

585
00:33:22,793 --> 00:33:24,795
Can't you see
we're just trying to help you?

586
00:33:25,505 --> 00:33:26,505
[Psych] Don't bother.

587
00:33:26,589 --> 00:33:29,634
Bashir, listen!

588
00:33:38,643 --> 00:33:40,061
[Fuerza growls]

It doesn't have to be this way.

591
00:33:46,776 --> 00:33:48,402
Tell him that we're
not like his parents,

592
00:33:48,528 --> 00:33:51,948
- and neither were his friends.
- Caleb, Lucas and the others,

593
00:33:52,865 --> 00:33:54,784
they never gave up on you.

594
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:58,621
[Psych] That's a lie.
All they ever cared about was money.

595
00:33:58,746 --> 00:34:00,266
[Flash] No, they cared about you more.

596
00:34:00,331 --> 00:34:02,375
After your parents died,

597
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:05,795
they started a fund
to help you get back on your feet.

598
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,548
Iris found bank statements
and donation receipts

599
00:34:08,631 --> 00:34:09,631
all in your name,

600
00:34:09,674 --> 00:34:11,259
Bashir Adil Malik.

601
00:34:11,425 --> 00:34:14,262
You didn't know because you pushed
them away when they reached out.

602
00:34:14,345 --> 00:34:16,639
[Psych] No. No, no, no.

603
00:34:16,931 --> 00:34:18,724
Naomi would never help me.

604
00:34:18,808 --> 00:34:20,017
You're right about that.

605
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:24,021
Naomi turned her back on you.
So you assumed the others would, too.

606
00:34:24,105 --> 00:34:25,105
But they didn't.

607
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,400
They wanted to help.

608
00:34:29,068 --> 00:34:30,152
So do we.

609
00:34:30,319 --> 00:34:33,823
[Psych] No, no, no. There's no way.
This can't be true.

610
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:37,785
No, it is. Don't push us away
like you have with everyone else.

611
00:34:39,537 --> 00:34:41,122
You always wanted a real family.

612
00:34:41,956 --> 00:34:42,956
Give us a chance.

613
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:45,167
We can be your family.

614
00:34:45,251 --> 00:34:47,628
[Psych] There's no such thing.

615
00:34:48,504 --> 00:34:49,964
<i>You don't know my pain.</i>

616
00:34:51,173 --> 00:34:54,468
You're right, Bashir, they don't.

617
00:34:55,511 --> 00:34:59,307
But I do, because my past
is just as dark as yours.

618
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:02,143
[sighs]

619
00:35:02,977 --> 00:35:05,563
I've been clean for five years.

620
00:35:07,023 --> 00:35:10,276
But when I was at my lowest,
I drove away everyone I ever loved.

621
00:35:11,068 --> 00:35:12,945
My own parents
won't even talk to me anymore.

622
00:35:14,697 --> 00:35:17,408
I know what real loneliness
feels like.

623
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:18,534
<i>But at some point,</i>

624
00:35:18,618 --> 00:35:22,246
<i>the walls we build need to come down
or they will crush us.</i>

625
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:26,375
And when they do, the people
who still want to be there for you,

626
00:35:27,335 --> 00:35:31,339
that's real family. That's us.

627
00:35:41,015 --> 00:35:42,015
Continue.

The choice is yours... brother.

00:36:15,091 --> 00:36:16,425
Okay, thanks.

632
00:36:17,593 --> 00:36:20,179
Bashir's victims are awake.
They're going to be okay.

633
00:36:21,764 --> 00:36:23,474
What are you guys doing?

634
00:36:23,557 --> 00:36:25,976
Barry and Alexa are bringing
a monster into our house.

635
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:28,020
- Two, actually.
- Can't be too careful.

636
00:36:29,063 --> 00:36:30,263
[Bashir] That's probably wise.

637
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:32,942
Oh.

638
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:36,028
There's a lot of fear in this place.

639
00:36:36,112 --> 00:36:37,530
I like it.

640
00:36:38,948 --> 00:36:40,157
It's okay.

641
00:36:40,324 --> 00:36:42,535
He's decided to give family a try.

642
00:36:42,618 --> 00:36:43,828
For now.

643
00:36:44,328 --> 00:36:46,205
I'm not sure if I'm sticking around.

644
00:36:47,873 --> 00:36:49,083
Hey, you know those rifles

645
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:51,544
and whatever those gloves
are supposed to be,

646
00:36:51,627 --> 00:36:53,627
that's not going to help you.
You know that, right?

647
00:36:54,004 --> 00:36:55,004
Just a heads-up.

648
00:36:55,172 --> 00:36:56,966
Don't make me angry.

649
00:37:00,094 --> 00:37:02,179
You got lucky the first time.

650
00:37:02,263 --> 00:37:04,932
You wanna roll the dice on round two?

651
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:08,203
- I think I have to...
- I gotta call Frost.

652
00:37:08,227 --> 00:37:09,687
- I have a thing...
- Sorry.

653
00:37:12,231 --> 00:37:13,566
You guys got this, right?

654
00:37:14,734 --> 00:37:16,444
- Yeah.
- [phone vibrating]

655
00:37:22,408 --> 00:37:23,617
Look, both of you, stand down.

656
00:37:24,201 --> 00:37:25,286
We're on the same team now.

657
00:37:26,412 --> 00:37:27,412
Her first.

658
00:37:33,169 --> 00:37:34,545
Yeah, this is new for all of us,

659
00:37:34,628 --> 00:37:38,174
so let's just take it slow,
all right?

660
00:37:40,593 --> 00:37:41,635
Fine.

661
00:37:53,898 --> 00:37:55,065
You wanted to see me?

662
00:37:56,025 --> 00:37:57,276
[sighs]

663
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:58,359
Yeah.

664
00:37:59,653 --> 00:38:01,533
I need to talk to you
about what happened today.

665
00:38:03,324 --> 00:38:05,451
Okay, I'm listening.

666
00:38:14,001 --> 00:38:18,172
As Captain,
it's hard to watch the ideals

667
00:38:18,297 --> 00:38:23,093
that you built your whole career on
get stripped away.

668
00:38:23,177 --> 00:38:26,430
I know, you're just doing your job.
I respect that.

669
00:38:26,514 --> 00:38:28,057
It's just that I wish...

670
00:38:30,643 --> 00:38:31,685
I wish...

671
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:39,318
that you could try to understand
what this city really needs.

672
00:38:40,778 --> 00:38:44,448
Because, see, it's not just
black and white, or even gray...

673
00:38:45,241 --> 00:38:47,451
I do things by the book, Captain.

674
00:38:47,535 --> 00:38:49,662
Maybe, but it's gonna take

675
00:38:49,745 --> 00:38:52,915
a whole lot more than that
when it comes to protecting

676
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:56,794
the people of Central City.
Only you can't see that.

677
00:38:58,629 --> 00:39:00,631
And since your "by the book"

678
00:39:04,093 --> 00:39:05,803
is nowhere near mine...

679
00:39:19,608 --> 00:39:21,235
Do you realize what you're doing?

680
00:39:22,778 --> 00:39:23,778
Yeah.

681
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,954
I'm staying on
the right side of the line.

682
00:40:04,445 --> 00:40:05,905
So now you know everything we do.

683
00:40:06,614 --> 00:40:08,324
Okay, so you got four kids,

684
00:40:08,407 --> 00:40:10,784
two of which are so pissed off,
they want to kill you.

685
00:40:11,785 --> 00:40:13,513
This is why some people
shouldn't have children.

686
00:40:13,537 --> 00:40:15,623
[scoffs] You are such an ass.

687
00:40:15,748 --> 00:40:18,500
I'm direct, sis.
There's a difference.

688
00:40:18,584 --> 00:40:21,795
Look, the point is,
Nora will come after you, too.

689
00:40:21,921 --> 00:40:24,423
Yeah, only if she's as nuts
as you say she is.

690
00:40:24,548 --> 00:40:26,133
She is. Trust me.

691
00:40:26,216 --> 00:40:29,970
Yeah, well, we'll see.
Either way, I'm not scared of her.

692
00:40:30,054 --> 00:40:31,974
- It's not that simple.
- You're not that simple.

693
00:40:32,473 --> 00:40:36,560
Alexa's right.
We can't underestimate Nora.

694
00:40:36,644 --> 00:40:39,730
As the Speed Force, she is different
than the rest of you.

695
00:40:39,813 --> 00:40:42,650
She's been around since
the dawn of time.

696
00:40:43,525 --> 00:40:45,402
And I thought I was dramatic.

697
00:40:45,778 --> 00:40:49,031
You can't beat her.
Not alone. None of us can.

698
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:51,533
Which is why we need to find Deon
as soon as possible.

699
00:40:58,582 --> 00:40:59,582
You're welcome.

700
00:41:02,044 --> 00:41:03,044
I'm sorry.

701
00:41:05,506 --> 00:41:07,758
Nora, please...

702
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:14,139
You made me do this, Barry.

703
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:30,154
It's done.

704
00:41:44,128 --> 00:41:45,128
No...
