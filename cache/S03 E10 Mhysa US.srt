1
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:44,247
Go, move out!

2
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,207
-King in the North!
-King in the North!

3
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,293
-King in the North!
-King in the North!

4
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:50,420
-King in the North!
-King in the North!

5
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,422
-King in the North!
-King in the North!

6
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:56,175
Here comes the King in the North!

7
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:58,469
-King in the North!
-King in the North!

8
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:00,680
-King in the North!
-King in the North!

9
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:02,724
-King in the North!
-King in the North!

10
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,466
Ser Eldrick Sarsfield
and Lord Desmond Crakehall.

11
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,843
Ser Eldrick Sarsfield
and Lord Desmond Crakehall.

12
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,428
What are you doing?

13
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,138
I have a list.

14
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,683
-A list of people you mean to kill?
-For laughing at me?

15
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,352
Do I look like Joffrey to you?

16
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:51,731
No, death seems a bit extreme.
Fear of death, on the other hand...

17
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,483
You should learn to ignore them.

18
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,902
My Lady, people have been laughing at me

19
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,487
far longer
than they've been laughing at you.

20
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:01,824
I'm the Halfman,
the Demon Monkey, the Imp.

21
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:02,992
You're a Lannister.

22
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:06,704
I am the disgraced daughter
of the traitor Ned Stark.

23
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,374
The disgraced daughter
and the Demon Monkey.

24
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:11,125
We're perfect for each other.

25
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:18,675
-So, how should we punish them?
-Who? Whom?

26
00:04:19,258 --> 00:04:21,844
Ser Eldrick Sarsfield
and Lord Desmond Crakehall.

27
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,599
I could speak to Lord Varys
and learn their perversions.

28
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:30,019
Anyone named Desmond Crakehall
must be a pervert.

29
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:32,772
I hear that you're a pervert.

30
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:36,025
I am the Imp.
I have certain standards to maintain.

31
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:41,239
We could sheep shift Lord Desmond's bed.

32
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:46,286
You cut a little hole in his mattress
and you stuff sheep dung inside.

33
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,871
Then you sew up the hole
and make his bed again.

34
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,749
His room will stink,
but he won't know where it's coming from.

35
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,126
Lady Sansa!

36
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,378
My sister used to do that
when she was angry with me.

37
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,172
And she was always angry with me.

38
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,508
Why sheep shift?

39
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,261
That's the vulgar word for dung.

40
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,390
-My Lady.
-Well, you asked me.

41
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:10,768
That's him!

42
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:13,688
My Lord, My Lady.

43
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,982
Your father has called
a meeting of the small council.

44
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,658
Killed a few puppies today?

45
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:28,411
Show him.

46
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:29,996
Come on, show him.

47
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:39,589
Apologies, My Lord. Old fingers.

48
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:50,349
"Roslin caught a fine fat trout."

49
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:54,562
"Her brothers gave her a pair
of wolf pelts for her wedding."

50
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:57,023
"Signed, Walder Frey."

51
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:03,237
Is that bad poetry
or is it supposed to mean something?

52
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,156
Robb Stark is dead.

53
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:07,909
And his bitch mother.

54
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:14,290
Write back to Lord Frey.
Thank him for his service and command him

55
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:16,834
to send Robb Stark's head.

56
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:20,379
I'm going to serve it to Sansa
at my wedding feast.

57
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:23,800
Your Grace, Lady Sansa
is your aunt by marriage.

58
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,802
A joke. Joffrey did not mean it.

59
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:27,387
Yes, I did.

60
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,890
I'm going to have it served
to Sansa at my wedding feast.

61
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:31,974
No.

62
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:38,147
-She is no longer yours to torment.
-Everyone is mine to torment.

63
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,527
You'd do well to remember that,
you little monster.

64
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:44,779
Oh, I'm a monster.

65
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:48,449
Perhaps you should speak
to me more softly, then.

66
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:54,330
Monsters are dangerous
and just now kings are dying like flies.

67
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:05,800
I could have your tongue out
for saying that.

68
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,177
Let him make his threats.

69
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:14,934
-He's a bitter little man.
-Lord Tyrion should apologize immediately.

70
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:19,981
Unacceptable, disrespectful,
and in very bad taste.

71
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,233
I am the king!

72
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:24,610
I will punish you.

73
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:28,823
Any man who must say,
"I am the king" is no true king.

74
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:33,578
I'll make sure you understand that
when I've won your war for you.

75
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,205
My father won the real war.

76
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:37,999
He killed Prince Rhaegar.

77
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:41,252
He took the crown
while you hid under Casterly Rock!

78
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:58,769
The king is tired.
See him to his chambers.

79
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,230
-Come along.
-I'm not tired.

80
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,232
We have so much to celebrate.

81
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,402
A wedding to plan. You must rest.

82
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:13,117
Grand Maester, perhaps some essence
of nightshade to help him sleep.

83
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:15,536
I'm not...

84
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:17,914
tired!

85
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:20,625
Come.

86
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:42,605
Not you.

87
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:55,159
You just sent the most powerful man
in Westeros to bed without his supper.

88
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:59,163
You're a fool if you believe
he's the most powerful man in Westeros.

89
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:04,627
-A treasonous statement. Joffrey is king.
-You really think a crown gives you power?

90
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:07,964
No.

91
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:11,300
I think armies give you power.

92
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:13,928
Robb Stark had one,

93
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,516
never lost a battle,
and you defeated him all the same.

94
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,394
Oh, I know.

95
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,313
Walder Frey gets all the credit.

96
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,317
Or the blame,
I suppose, depending on your allegiance.

97
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,989
Walder Frey is many things,
but a brave man?

98
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,157
No.

99
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:41,205
He never would have risked such an action
if he didn't have certain assurances.

100
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,581
Which he got from me.

101
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:47,712
-Do you disapprove?
-I'm all for cheating. This is war.

102
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:53,217
-But to slaughter them at a wedding.
-Explain to me why it is more noble

103
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:56,637
to kill 10,000 men in battle
than a dozen at dinner.

104
00:09:57,013 --> 00:10:03,436
-So, that's why you did it? To save lives?
-To end the war. To protect the family.

105
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,272
Do you want to write a song
for the dead Starks?

106
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,190
Go ahead, write one.

107
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,694
I'm in this world a little while longer

108
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:16,449
to defend the Lannisters,
to defend my blood.

109
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:19,285
-The northerners will never forget.
-Good.

110
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:23,664
Let them remember what happens
when they march on the south.

111
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,711
All the Stark men are dead.

112
00:10:29,628 --> 00:10:31,088
Winterfell is a ruin.

113
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,968
Roose Bolton will be named
the Warden of the North

114
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:40,556
until your son by Sansa comes of age.

115
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:47,021
I believe you still have
some work to do on that score.

116
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,567
Do you think she'll open her legs for me

117
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:55,112
after I tell her how we murdered
her mother and brother?

118
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:59,158
One way or another,
you will get that girl pregnant.

119
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,409
I will not rape her.

120
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:06,040
Shall I explain to you in one
easy lesson how the world works?

121
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:08,542
Use small words. I'm not as bright as you.

122
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:12,129
The house
that puts family first will always defeat

123
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:16,217
the house that puts the whims and wishes
of its sons and daughters first.

124
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:21,972
A good man does everything in his power
to better his family's position,

125
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:26,560
regardless of his own selfish desires.

126
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,984
-Does that amuse you?
-No, it's a very good lesson.

127
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:38,406
Only it's easy for you
to preach utter devotion to family

128
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,658
when you're making all the decisions.

129
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,326
Easy for me, is it?

130
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:46,163
When have you ever done something
that wasn't in your interest

131
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:50,668
-but solely for the benefit of the family?
-The day that you were born.

132
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:59,844
I wanted to carry you into the sea
and let the waves wash you away.

133
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,181
Instead, I let you live.

134
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,977
And I brought you up as my son.

135
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:14,150
Because you're a Lannister.

136
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,208
Sansa.

137
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,824
-It's empty.
-Let's find a place to sleep.

138
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,252
Hodor.

139
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:20,424
-Hodor.
-Don't, Hodor.

140
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:29,225
-Maybe we shouldn't stay here.
-You'd rather be out there?

141
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,686
There are a lot of stories
about this place.

142
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,856
Horrible stories.

143
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,816
I always quite liked the horrible stories.

144
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:39,360
So did I.

145
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:41,362
Once.

146
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:47,076
-You ever heard about the Rat Cook?
-No.

147
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,454
-Who's he?
-Just a cook in the Night's Watch.

148
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:55,251
He was angry at the king
for something, I don't remember.

149
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,629
When the king was visiting the Nightfort,

150
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:03,217
the cook killed the king's son,
cooked him into a big pie

151
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:06,053
with onions, carrots, mushrooms and bacon.

152
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:10,307
That night he served the pie to the king.

153
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:15,521
He liked the taste of his son
so much, he asked for a second slice.

154
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,527
The gods turned the cook
into a giant white rat

155
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,737
who could only eat his own young.

156
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,323
He's been roaming
the Nightfort ever since,

157
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,285
devouring his own babies.

158
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,371
But no matter what he does...

159
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,499
he's always hungry.

160
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:40,045
If the gods turned
every killer into a giant white rat--

161
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,881
It wasn't for murder
the gods cursed the Rat Cook

162
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:47,511
or for serving the king's son in a pie.
He killed a guest beneath his roof.

163
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,265
That's something the gods can't forgive.

164
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:03,235
"The late Walder Frey,"
old Tully called me

165
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:06,739
because I didn't get my men
to the Trident in time for battle.

166
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:08,532
He thought he was witty.

167
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,118
Look at us now, Tully.

168
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:16,165
You're dead, your daughter's dead,
your grandson's dead,

169
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:19,418
your son spent
his wedding night in a dungeon

170
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:22,212
and I'm Lord of Riverrun.

171
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:25,299
The Blackfish escaped.

172
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:31,013
An old man on the run with no allies.

173
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:35,142
I have Tywin Lannister backing me.
Who does he have?

174
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:37,019
As you say.

175
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:40,939
They all laughed at me,
all those high lords.

176
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,192
They all thought they were better than me.

177
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,487
Ned Stark, Hoster Tully.

178
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:50,115
People snigger when I marry a young girl,

179
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:53,327
but who said a word when Jon Arryn
married the little Tully bitch?

180
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,288
-You'll be needing a new young girl.
-Yeah.

181
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,917
Got that to look forward to.

182
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,961
And you,

183
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:08,717
the Warden of the North.
No more Starks to bow and scrape to.

184
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:12,930
Must have been torture following
that stupid boy all over the country.

185
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:15,015
He ignored my advice at every turn.

186
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,143
If he'd been a trifle less arrogant.

187
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:22,064
Calling himself the Young Wolf.
How's that for pomposity?

188
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,735
Well, here's to the Young Wolf!

189
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:29,947
Forever young.

190
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:38,288
Will you move to Winterfell
now that the war's over?

191
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:40,082
At some point, perhaps.

192
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,752
-But Winterfell's in ruins.
-Yeah.

193
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:47,548
What happened up there?

194
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:53,429
I heard the Greyjoy boy seized the place.
I heard he killed all the ravens.

195
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,014
And after that, nothing.

196
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,976
I sent my bastard Ramsay to root him out.

197
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:03,772
Robb Stark offered amnesty
for the iron born if they gave us Theon.

198
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,693
-And?
-Ramsay delivered the terms.

199
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,238
The ironborn turned on Theon
as we knew they would.

200
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:14,450
They handed him over trussed and hooded.

201
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,703
But Ramsay... well...

202
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,540
Ramsay has his own way of doing things.

203
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,587
Well, the girls weren't lying.
You had a good-sized cock.

204
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,388
What?

205
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,186
Pork sausage.

206
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,189
You think I'm some sort of savage?

207
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,912
People talk about phantom limbs.

208
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:03,415
An amputee might have an itch
where his foot used to be.

209
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,043
So, I've always wondered...

210
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,424
do eunuchs have a phantom cock?

211
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:18,931
Next time you think about naked girls,
would you feel an itch?

212
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:28,816
Sorry.

213
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:31,777
I shouldn't make jokes.

214
00:18:34,112 --> 00:18:36,740
My mother taught me
not to throw stones at cripples.

215
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:43,872
But my father taught me
to aim for their head.

216
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:45,582
Kill me.

217
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,417
Sorry, what?

218
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:50,546
Kill me.

219
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,258
A little louder.

220
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:56,385
Kill me!

221
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:02,683
You're no good to me dead. We need you.

222
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:27,082
You don't look like
a Theon Greyjoy anymore.

223
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,294
That's a name for a lord.

224
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:35,090
But you're not a lord, are you?

225
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,844
You're just meat.

226
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,932
Stinking meat.

227
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,021
You reek.

228
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,900
Reek!

229
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,027
That's a good name for you.

230
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:57,654
What's your name?

231
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,366
Theon Greyjoy.

232
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,123
What's your name?

233
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,671
Theon Greyjoy.

234
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:27,392
-Please.
-What is your name?

235
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,104
Reek.

236
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,026
My name is...

237
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:39,071
Reek.

238
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,057
Hodor.

239
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,050
-Don't kill me!
-Who are you?

240
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,136
-Sam! Sam!
-Who are you?

241
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,304
Gilly. Don't hurt us.

242
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,767
-Where are you going?
-To Castle Black.

243
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,311
I'm a brother of the Night's Watch.

244
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,438
My brother, he's in the Night's--

245
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:57,107
-Who's your brother?
-Doesn't matter.

246
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:07,534
You're Jon's brother.

247
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,329
-The one who fell from the window.
-No, I'm not.

248
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,917
I've been around Ghost enough
to know a direwolf when I see one.

249
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,129
And I've heard all about Hodor.

250
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:21,173
Hodor.

251
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,594
I'd be dead if it wasn't for Jon.

252
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,346
If you're his brother,
you're my brother, too.

253
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,640
And anything I can do to help you, I will.

254
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,101
Take us north of the Wall.

255
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:39,775
What?

256
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:43,570
-Why in the world would you want to go--
-I don't want to. I have to.

257
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,697
How did you get through the Wall?

258
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,157
Does the well lead
to an underground river?

259
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:48,992
Is that how you came here?

260
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:50,952
Come with us.

261
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:55,123
There are steps carved
into the south side of the Wall.

262
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:58,794
Hodor can carry you to the top.
We'll walk straight to Castle Black.

263
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:01,797
Come with us.
There's nothing north but death.

264
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:06,301
If Jon is alive,
then Castle Black's where he'll be.

265
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,261
It's the safest place for you.

266
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,806
There's nowhere safe any longer.
You know that.

267
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,350
What I know is what I saw.

268
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:16,853
And if you saw it, too,
you'd run the other way.

269
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:19,564
You saw the White Walkers
and the army of the dead.

270
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:24,402
-How do you know that?
-The Night's Watch can't stop them.

271
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:28,073
The kings of Westeros
and all their armies can't stop them.

272
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:39,751
But you're going to stop them?

273
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:41,753
Please, Sam.

274
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:44,673
I have to go north.

275
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:47,843
I have to.

276
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:21,209
"Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands
and invader of the North."

277
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:27,132
"I give you until the full moon to order
all ironborn scum out of the North

278
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:31,386
and back to those shit-stained rocks
you call a home."

279
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:34,764
"On the first night of the full moon,

280
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:39,227
I will hunt down
every islander still in our lands

281
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,605
and flay them living,

282
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:47,444
the way I flayed the 20 ironborn scum
I found at Winterfell."

283
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:51,156
"In the box, you'll find a special gift...

284
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:54,743
Theon's favorite toy."

285
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:58,371
"He cried when I took it away from him."

286
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:22,520
"Leave the North now
or more boxes will follow

287
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:24,898
with more Theon."

288
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:29,903
"Signed Ramsay Snow,
natural-born son of Roose Bolton,

289
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:32,572
Lord of the Dreadfort
and Warden of the North."

290
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:37,494
Get that out of my sight.

291
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:46,586
Theon disobeyed my orders.

292
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,968
The boy is a fool.

293
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:58,431
He cannot further the Greyjoy line.

294
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:03,603
I will not give up
the lands I have seized,

295
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:07,148
the strongholds I have taken.
Get this away from me.

296
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:11,278
-He's your son.
-Son?

297
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:15,031
He's not a man anymore.

298
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:19,119
He's your son. He's my brother.

299
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:23,206
-He's a Greyjoy.
-Watch yourself.

300
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:26,251
I've made my decision.

301
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,216
And I've made mine.

302
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:39,597
I'm going to pick
the fastest ship in our fleet.

303
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:45,395
I'm going to choose the 50
best killers on the Iron Islands.

304
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,188
Get those ropes!

305
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:51,901
I'm going to sail up the Narrow Sea
all the way to the Weeping Water.

306
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,655
I'm going to march on the Dreadfort.

307
00:26:57,115 --> 00:27:02,037
I'm going to find my little brother
and I'm going to bring him home.

308
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:09,419
What is it?

309
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:12,547
-Dragonglass.
-We found them at the Fist.

310
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,633
Someone buried them a long time ago.

311
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:18,553
Someone wanted us to find them.

312
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:20,889
Why?

313
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:22,891
What are they for?

314
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,357
-Killing White Walkers.
-How do you know that?

315
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,901
The walker came for my baby.

316
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:35,403
And Sam...

317
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:38,531
But no one's killed
a White Walker in thousands of years.

318
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:42,452
Well, I suppose
someone had to be the first.

319
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:44,496
Take it, Hodor.

320
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:53,713
And the archer.

321
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:00,553
I got lucky...

322
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:02,931
with one of them.

323
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:05,600
There are more.

324
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:07,894
Many more.

325
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,480
And for every one of them...

326
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,066
the dead men...

327
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:15,944
more than you could count.

328
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:21,449
I wish you'd come with us.

329
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:24,285
I wish I could.

330
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,622
I really do.

331
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:16,838
How are you keeping?

332
00:29:18,756 --> 00:29:19,674
Great.

333
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:23,761
-Never better.
-It was just a bit of blood.

334
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,181
I should have known.

335
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:29,267
Every time a highborn
asks my name, it's trouble.

336
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:32,562
We're not really people to you, are we?

337
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:34,397
Just a million different ways
to get what you want.

338
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,441
-I'm not a highborn.
-She called you Ser.

339
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:38,651
I heard it.

340
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:42,780
A recent state of affairs.

341
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:48,995
I was born in Flea Bottom just like you.

342
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:54,626
Sure, you were.
You're my friend. You're here to help.

343
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:57,670
-I lived below the Street of Flour.
-How far below?

344
00:29:58,546 --> 00:29:59,756
How close to the Red Keep were you?

345
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:04,010
The shit that poured
from their privy pipes

346
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:07,430
flowed down the side of Aegon's Hill

347
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:11,226
along Tanner's Row
and right in front of my front door.

348
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,645
-On Gin Alley.
-Gin Alley.

349
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:20,818
The Street of Steel,
with your armor and your knights?

350
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:23,696
You lived in the fancy part of town.

351
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:29,702
And here we are now.

352
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:34,165
Two boys from Flea Bottom
in the castle of a king.

353
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:36,876
Yeah, we've come a long way.

354
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:39,796
We're all the same, really.

355
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:43,007
She went to great pains
to point that out to me.

356
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:47,971
If you mistrust fancy people so much,
why were you in such a hurry to trust her?

357
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:51,724
You're me.

358
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:56,729
Never been with a woman.
Never talked to a woman, really.

359
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:58,690
And then she comes at you...

360
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:01,359
big words, no clothes.

361
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:03,486
What would you have done?

362
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:08,324
And she does know her way
around a man's head, I'll give her that.

363
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:16,207
So, how'd you become a lord?

364
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:20,086
-That's a long story.
-Better not, then.

365
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,130
I'm a bit busy.

366
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:28,886
Many years ago I helped
King Stannis out of a difficult situation.

367
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:32,015
He rewarded me with a lordship.

368
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,226
And this.

369
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:38,896
You see?

370
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:41,316
Highborns.

371
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:46,904
I didn't want to be a lord.

372
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:49,616
I nearly didn't accept.

373
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:52,327
-Why did you?
-I did it for my son.

374
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,873
I didn't want him
to step over a river of shit

375
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:58,666
every time he stepped
through his front door.

376
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,629
I wanted him to have a better life.

377
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,591
Does he?

378
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:09,260
He's dead.

379
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:16,684
How'd he die?

380
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:19,479
Following me.

381
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:33,368
When did you come to this strange country?

382
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:39,082
-When I was 13.
-You were only a child.

383
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:42,877
I stopped being a child when I was nine.

384
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:45,380
My mother made sure of that.

385
00:32:47,965 --> 00:32:50,968
You've been a good influence
on our mutual friend, you know.

386
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:53,888
He used to drink from sundown to sunup,

387
00:32:53,971 --> 00:32:57,141
visit three brothels a night,
gamble away his father's money.

388
00:32:58,476 --> 00:32:59,811
Now, it's just the drinking.

389
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:03,439
And now, I'm his wife's servant.

390
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:06,859
I brush her hair and clip her nails
and empty her chamber pot.

391
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:09,570
She is a sweet young thing.
None of this is her fault.

392
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:12,407
I love that girl. I would kill for her.

393
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:17,078
-Do you think that makes it easier for me?
-No, I expect not.

394
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:23,876
She's young
and she's beautiful and... highborn.

395
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,963
We break bread with them,
but that doesn't make us family.

396
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:31,592
We've learned their language,
but we'll never be their countrymen.

397
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:39,183
If you let yourself believe
that a foreign girl with no name

398
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,686
could spend her life
with the son of Tywin Lannister.

399
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:43,896
-I have a name.
-You have one name.

400
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:48,192
As do I.
Here, only the family name matters.

401
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,778
What do you want from me, Lord Varys?

402
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:56,117
Diamonds.

403
00:33:57,034 --> 00:33:59,620
I'd tell you to beware
carrying so much wealth,

404
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,622
but you know how to protect yourself.

405
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:04,000
Get on one of those ships.

406
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:07,211
Sail to Pentos or Lys or Myr.

407
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:12,467
You can buy a house with these diamonds,
a very large house.

408
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,051
Hire servants.

409
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:18,181
Start a new life, a good life,
far from here.

410
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:23,186
The mysterious foreign beauty.
You'll have suitors lining up.

411
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:25,688
Why do you want me to leave?

412
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,733
Tyrion Lannister
is one of the few people alive

413
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:30,568
who could make this country
a better place.

414
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:34,447
He has the mind for it, he has the will,
he has the right last name. And you...

415
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:38,534
you are a complication.

416
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:42,455
I know you love him.

417
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:46,375
And I know it's true love,
not bought by gold and silver.

418
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,753
I'm not asking you to leave him for money.

419
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:51,714
I'm asking you to leave

420
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:56,219
because your presence
in the capital endangers him.

421
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,014
This will never be your home, My Lady.

422
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:04,393
Find a true home
somewhere far from here...

423
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:07,814
while there's still time.

424
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:10,274
Lord Varys.

425
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:18,115
If he wants me to leave,
he can tell me himself.

426
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:28,835
Keep up.

427
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,295
I don't think I can, My Lord.

428
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,092
It's not easy being drunk all the time.

429
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:40,596
Everyone would do it if it were easy.

430
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:44,934
Leave.

431
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:57,572
So, enjoying married life?

432
00:36:01,158 --> 00:36:04,579
An unhappy wife
is a wine merchant's best friend.

433
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,457
-She doesn't deserve this.
-Deserve?

434
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:11,002
Be careful with that.

435
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:14,797
Start trying to work out who deserves what

436
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:18,050
and before long,
you'll spend the rest of your days

437
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:21,012
weeping for each
and every person in the world.

438
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:24,307
There's nothing worse
than a late-blooming philosopher.

439
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:28,769
Will you be facing
your marriage to Ser Loras

440
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:33,316
-with the same philosophical spirit?
-I won't be marrying Ser Loras.

441
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:35,985
I seem to remember
saying something similar

442
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:39,030
-about my own marriage.
-You're not me.

443
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:44,493
You want to make things
better for Sansa? Give her a child.

444
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:49,415
So you can tell Father it was you
who finally talked me into it?

445
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:51,792
So she can have
some happiness in her life.

446
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:56,923
You have children.
How happy would you say you are?

447
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:01,844
Not very.

448
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:06,849
But if it weren't for my children,

449
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:09,644
I'd have thrown myself
from the highest window in the Red Keep.

450
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:13,397
They're the reason I'm alive.

451
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:15,858
Even Joffrey?

452
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,986
Even Joffrey.

453
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,700
He was all I had once.

454
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:27,161
Before Myrcella was born.

455
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:35,169
I used to spend hours looking at him.

456
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:38,297
His wisps of hair.

457
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:41,884
His tiny little hands and feet.

458
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,513
He was such a jolly little fellow.

459
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:52,103
You always hear
the terrible ones were terrible babies.

460
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:54,855
"We should have known.
Even then we should have known."

461
00:37:55,272 --> 00:37:56,524
It's nonsense.

462
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,237
Whenever he was with me, he was happy.

463
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,536
And no one can take that away
from me, not even Joffrey,

464
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,955
how it feels to have someone.

465
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:14,250
Someone of your own.

466
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:26,554
How long does it go on?

467
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,184
Until we've dealt with all our enemies.

468
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:38,566
Every time we deal with an enemy,
we create two more.

469
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,404
Then I suppose
it will go on for quite a long time.

470
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:51,370
I'm telling you, that's what she did.

471
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,834
Sounded like a cow in heat.

472
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:58,794
-Aye, not for long.
-That's right.

473
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,130
Black Walder shut her up right quick.

474
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:04,717
None of the Starks had much to say
about the end of that meal.

475
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,177
I'll tell you what, though.

476
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:09,138
The hardest thing was getting
that wolf's head to stay on the body.

477
00:39:10,347 --> 00:39:12,308
-You sewed it on?
-I did.

478
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:15,019
I bet there were a thousand men claiming
they were the one.

479
00:39:15,352 --> 00:39:16,270
It was me.

480
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:19,565
And Malcolm and Talbott.

481
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:22,610
Well, the thing was so heavy,
it fell off the first time.

482
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:26,155
Took the skin right with it.
What we ended up having to do

483
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:28,949
was hook the needle
right under the collarbone.

484
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:31,035
Give it a nice firm mooring and...

485
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:37,625
-What do you want?
-Mind if I keep warm?

486
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:40,753
-Fuck off.
-But I'm hungry.

487
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:45,716
Does "fuck off" mean
something different where you're from?

488
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:47,176
I've got money.

489
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,725
-What kind of coin is that?
-It's worth a lot.

490
00:39:58,312 --> 00:39:59,313
Sorry.

491
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,190
Little shit.

492
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:07,905
Fool!

493
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:24,672
Where did you get the knife?

494
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,091
From you.

495
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:32,513
Is that the first man you've killed?

496
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:34,557
The first man.

497
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:40,271
Next time you're going to do
something like that, tell me first.

498
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:54,410
Valar morghulis.

499
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,525
Ygritte, you know I didn't have a choice.

500
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:31,864
You always knew who I was…

501
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,325
what I am.

502
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:39,079
I have to go home now.

503
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,584
I know you won't hurt me.

504
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,588
You know nothing, Jon Snow.

505
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:53,302
I do know some things.

506
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:56,972
I know I love you.

507
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,518
I know you love me.

508
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:06,482
But I have to go home now.

509
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:50,276
I know how this must look.

510
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:55,531
What I meant was...

511
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:57,783
-I swear to you, My Lord--
-I'm not a lord, my dear.

512
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:01,120
Not for many, many years.

513
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:08,711
Every man who joins the Night's Watch
renounces all former titles.

514
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:12,298
Among other things.

515
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:18,804
-What is your name?
-Gilly.

516
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,308
For the gillyflower.

517
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:26,353
-Lovely.
-Yes, my...

518
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:30,607
Maester.

519
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,819
-Master.
-Maester.

520
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:37,072
And the child?

521
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:42,411
-She hasn't chosen a name yet.
-His name is Sam.

522
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:47,958
Tarly...

523
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:54,757
do you remember the oath you swore
when you joined this order?

524
00:43:55,632 --> 00:43:57,843
He's not my child, Maester Aemon.

525
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:01,180
She's one of Craster's wives.

526
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:09,271
I remember every word of the oath.

527
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:13,484
"Night gathers and my watch begins."

528
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:16,904
"I am the shield
that guards the realms of men."

529
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,617
"The realms of men."

530
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:25,954
That means her as well as us.

531
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:32,669
We didn't build 500 miles of ice walls
700 feet high to keep out men.

532
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:37,966
The night is gathering, Maester Aemon.
I've seen it.

533
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:41,178
It's coming for all of us.

534
00:44:44,681 --> 00:44:50,646
Gilly, you and your son
will be our guests for the time being.

535
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:57,444
We certainly cannot send you back
beyond the Wall.

536
00:44:58,695 --> 00:45:01,365
Thank you, Maester.

537
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:05,119
-I can cook and clean and I can--
-Good.

538
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:07,413
Samwell...

539
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:10,833
fetch a quill and inkwell.

540
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:18,757
I hope your penmanship
is better than your swordplay.

541
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:20,634
Miles better.

542
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:25,931
We had 44 ravens at last count.

543
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:28,725
Make sure they're all fed.

544
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:31,812
Every one of them flies tonight.

545
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:47,035
"To His Grace, King Stannis Baratheon."

546
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:53,375
"Invaded-- invited to the name day...

547
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:56,462
celebration for...

548
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:00,424
Rylene Florent

549
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:03,051
on the first nigit..."

550
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:04,803
Night.

551
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:07,723
"First night of the full moon."

552
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:10,768
-Why is there a G in night?
-I don't know. There just is.

553
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:13,979
Well, your Father's
not going to go to that.

554
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:17,941
My books are better
than these boring scrolls.

555
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,152
You could read about Balerion the Dread.

556
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:23,489
They say you can still see his skull
in the dungeons beneath the Red Keep.

557
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:26,074
I'd like to see that someday.

558
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,869
I've been trying to stay out
of those dungeons my whole life.

559
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:32,789
"His fangs were as long
as bastard swords."

560
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:36,251
Aye, old Balerion's definitely better

561
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:38,670
than anything
your cousin Rylene's got on offer.

562
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:43,800
But now that I'm your father's Hand again,
I have to keep him informed.

563
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:47,763
The king
does not have time for this drudgery.

564
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:53,936
"To all the lords
and knobble men of Westeros."

565
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:56,146
-Noblemen.
-"Noblemen of Westeros,

566
00:46:57,689 --> 00:47:00,400
the Night's Watch...

567
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:05,656
implores..."

568
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:07,908
What is it?

569
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:16,333
Why are they ringing the bells?
Are we being attacked?

570
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:20,212
Stay here. Bar the door.

571
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:43,860
The usurper Robb Stark is dead.
Betrayed by his bannerman.

572
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:49,116
And you take credit
because you dropped a leech into the fire?

573
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:50,200
I take no credit.

574
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:53,412
I have faith
and my faith has been rewarded.

575
00:47:57,124 --> 00:48:01,086
Your Grace, the world has got so far bent.

576
00:48:01,878 --> 00:48:05,424
I've seen things crawl
out of nightmares, but my eyes were open.

577
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:08,802
I don't know if Robb Stark died
because of the Red Woman's sorcery

578
00:48:08,885 --> 00:48:11,054
or because at war men die all the time,

579
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:14,182
but I do know
that uniting the Seven Kingdoms

580
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:18,812
with blood magic is wrong.
It is evil. And you are not an evil man.

581
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:22,107
Do you know who had this table
carved and painted, Ser Davos?

582
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:24,401
Aegon Targaryen.

583
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:27,029
And do you know
how Aegon Targaryen conquered Westeros?

584
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:28,989
On the back of his dragon,
Balerion the Dread.

585
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:33,118
He had a smaller fleet
than the kings he faced

586
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:35,746
and a smaller army,
but he had three dragons.

587
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:37,664
Dragons are magic, Ser Davos.

588
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:40,709
My enemies have made my kingdom bleed.

589
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:44,504
I will not forget that.

590
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:47,591
I will not forgive that.

591
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:53,388
I will punish them
with any arms at my disposal.

592
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:55,724
You do not need to burn the boy.

593
00:48:57,976 --> 00:48:59,061
If what you say is true,

594
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:02,939
a drop of his blood killed Robb Stark--

595
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:05,359
And our king is still
no closer to the Iron Throne.

596
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:10,906
A great gift requires a great sacrifice.

597
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:29,841
His name is Gendry.

598
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:32,302
He's a good lad.

599
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:38,225
A poor lad from Flea Bottom
who happens to be your nephew.

600
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:46,817
What is the life
of one bastard boy against a kingdom?

601
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:50,320
Everything.

602
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:53,198
The boy must die.

603
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:03,000
-What are you doing?
-You're leaving.

604
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:07,629
-Is this some kind of trick?
-Yes, but not on you.

605
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:14,010
Aim for that star.

606
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:17,597
Don't stop.
There's bread and water. Go slow with it.

607
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:22,060
If you finish it off,
no matter how thirsty you get,

608
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:26,773
-don't drink seawater.
-I know not to drink seawater.

609
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:30,193
Row for a full day and night
and you'll reach Rook's Rest.

610
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:32,529
You'll want to stop there. Don't.

611
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:34,740
-She'll find you.
-Where should I go?

612
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:37,743
You must keep the coast on your left side
until you reach King's Landing.

613
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:41,621
-The gold cloaks are looking for me.
-They were looking for me for 20 years.

614
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,331
-Do they know your face?
-No.

615
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:44,708
I'd worry more about the Red Woman.

616
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:53,550
The other way.

617
00:50:58,430 --> 00:50:59,765
You ever been in a boat before?

618
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:02,809
-No.
-You know how to swim?

619
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:06,855
-No.
-Don't fall out. Go on.

620
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:12,903
-Why are you doing this?
-Because it's right.

621
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:15,739
And because I'm a slow learner.

622
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:22,162
When you get to Flea Bottom,
have a bowl of brown for me.

623
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:28,752
Horse approaching!

624
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:31,713
Halt! Halt!

625
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:52,734
Jon! Jon, it's us.

626
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:54,736
I don't think he can see us.

627
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:01,034
Pyp?

628
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:05,664
-Sam?
-Hush, now.

629
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:08,375
You're home.

630
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:12,212
Carry him inside. Gently.

631
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:39,614
Out of the way.

632
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:43,410
Step aside, country boy.
People working here.

633
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:30,916
Cersei.

634
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:51,269
You don't deny it?

635
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:54,147
No.

636
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:56,358
I let him go.

637
00:53:57,943 --> 00:53:59,736
Your mercy saved the boy's life.

638
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:03,573
-You feel good about that?
-Aye, I do.

639
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:05,867
You saved one innocent.

640
00:54:06,868 --> 00:54:09,454
How many tens of thousands
have you doomed?

641
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:15,669
There has got to be another way.

642
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:19,005
What other way?
Tell us about this other way.

643
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:20,215
I don't know, Your Grace.

644
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:22,801
I can't see the future in the fire.

645
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:29,516
Very well, Ser Davos Seaworth.

646
00:54:31,476 --> 00:54:34,479
I, Stannis of the House Baratheon,
First of My Name,

647
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:37,023
Rightful King of the Andals
and the First Men, sentence you to die.

648
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,191
I understand.

649
00:54:38,274 --> 00:54:40,485
But since you haven't yet
unnamed me Hand of the King,

650
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:42,612
it is my duty to advise you against it.

651
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:45,073
-You're gonna need me.
-Take him away.

652
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:48,410
Why am I gonna need you?

653
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:54,040
My King.

654
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:00,547
It's from Maester Aemon
of the Night's Watch.

655
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:02,340
Their Lord Commander is dead.

656
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:04,968
Took a ranging party north
and never made it back.

657
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:06,511
One lad did, though.

658
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:12,225
What he saw beyond the Wall,
it's coming for all of us.

659
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,074
When did you learn to read?

660
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:31,870
Matthos taught me before he died
so I could be of better service to you.

661
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:42,589
This War of Five Kings means nothing.

662
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:47,010
The true war lies to the north, My King.

663
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,305
Death marches on the Wall.

664
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:53,099
Only you can stop him.

665
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:55,268
You can't stop him alone.

666
00:55:56,352 --> 00:55:57,979
You need someone
to rebuild your army for you,

667
00:55:58,938 --> 00:56:01,232
someone to convince this lord
and that lord to fight for you,

668
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:03,943
to bring sellswords
and pirates to your side.

669
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:05,195
I've made my decision.

670
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:08,406
He's right.

671
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:12,535
You need him.
He has a part to play in the war to come.

672
00:56:22,378 --> 00:56:23,588
You see, Ser Davos?

673
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:27,467
You've been saved
by that fire god you like to mock.

674
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:33,014
You're in his army now.

675
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:58,248
They will come, Your Grace.

676
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:00,416
When they're ready.

677
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:02,627
Perhaps they didn't want to be conquered.

678
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:06,798
You didn't conquer them.
You liberated them.

679
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:10,218
People learn to love their chains.

680
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:13,698
No.

681
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:54,989
-Mhysa!
-Mhysa!

682
00:58:55,073 --> 00:59:00,828
-Mhysa! Mhysa!
-Mhysa! Mhysa!

683
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:02,288
What does it mean?

684
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:04,999
It is old Ghiscari, Khaleesi.

685
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:08,336
It means "mother."

686
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:13,675
-Mhysa! Mhysa!
-Mhysa! Mhysa!

687
00:59:13,758 --> 00:59:16,469
-It's all right.
-Mhysa! Mhysa!
