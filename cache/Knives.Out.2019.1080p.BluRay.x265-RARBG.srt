00:01:43,212 --> 00:01:45,114
Morning,
Mr. Thrombey.

3
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,795
Mr. Thrombey? You up there?

4
00:02:01,796 --> 00:02:03,365
Mr. Thrombey,
I'm coming in.

5
00:02:14,543 --> 00:02:15,810
Shit!

6
00:02:36,931 --> 00:02:39,166
<i>You killed him, you bastard!</i>

7
00:02:39,168 --> 00:02:40,267
<i>You murdered him!</i>

8
00:02:40,269 --> 00:02:41,801
<i>I didn't murder nobody!</i>

9
00:02:41,803 --> 00:02:43,136
<i>You slashed
his face open.</i>

10
00:02:43,138 --> 00:02:45,572
<i>You left him bleeding in
the street like a stuck pig,</i>

11
00:02:45,574 --> 00:02:47,807
<i>then you crushed his skull
with a forklift</i>

12
00:02:47,809 --> 00:02:50,210
<i>and burned his hands off
to erase the fingerprints!</i>

13
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:51,545
<i>You'll never prove it.</i>

14
00:02:51,547 --> 00:02:53,879
<i>We have
the nanny-cam footage!</i>

15
00:02:53,881 --> 00:02:55,047
Alice, turn that
off now, please?

16
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:57,016
- <i>You're under arrest for...</i>
- Why? It's almost over.

17
00:02:57,018 --> 00:02:59,018
- Now. Please, just turn it off.
- What? They're finding out who did it

18
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,120
and the WiFi
sucks in my room,

19
00:03:00,122 --> 00:03:01,154
- so give me a break.
- Turn it off, now.

20
00:03:01,156 --> 00:03:02,122
- There's two minutes left.
- Alice!

21
00:03:02,124 --> 00:03:04,258
- What? There isn't even anything bad on.
- Off!

22
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,925
It's just normal TV

23
00:03:05,927 --> 00:03:07,261
- and they're just talking!
- They're talking murder on it!

24
00:03:07,263 --> 00:03:08,161
Normal TV,
and they're just talking!

25
00:03:08,163 --> 00:03:09,263
Your sister just
had a friend she loved...

26
00:03:09,265 --> 00:03:11,265
- Okay, okay! Okay! Whatever.
- ...slit his throat open

27
00:03:11,267 --> 00:03:13,300
and she doesn't need to
be hearing that right now!

28
00:03:13,302 --> 00:03:14,802
Let's be sensitive!

29
00:03:18,607 --> 00:03:21,174
Alice, you can keep watching your
show, it's fine.

30
00:03:21,176 --> 00:03:22,409
No, I guessed
who did it anyway.

31
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:24,344
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry, Marta.

32
00:03:24,346 --> 00:03:25,980
It's okay.

33
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:28,783
It's Harlan's son.

34
00:03:32,488 --> 00:03:33,587
Hi, Walt.

35
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:35,855
- <i>Hi, Marta, it's Walt.</i>
- Mmm-hmm.

36
00:03:35,857 --> 00:03:37,890
<i>Would you mind coming
to the house early?</i>

37
00:03:37,892 --> 00:03:41,060
<i>The police have a few
more questions for everybody.</i>

38
00:03:41,062 --> 00:03:42,197
What?

39
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:03,983
Hey.
Excuse me, ma'am.

40
00:04:03,985 --> 00:04:05,118
You with the help?

41
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,987
Hey! Her name's Marta.
She was Grandad's nurse.

42
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:10,923
She's with us.
"The help"?

43
00:04:10,925 --> 00:04:12,659
It's okay.
I'm sorry.

44
00:04:12,661 --> 00:04:15,197
No, it's not okay.
What the hell?

45
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:18,933
Aw.

46
00:04:24,972 --> 00:04:26,108
How are
you doing?

47
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,443
Not very good.

48
00:04:29,445 --> 00:04:30,446
Alone.

49
00:04:31,413 --> 00:04:35,150
Lots of this and not
knowing what to do next.

50
00:04:36,118 --> 00:04:39,952
Marta, anything
you need...

51
00:04:39,954 --> 00:04:41,457
You're part of
this family.

52
00:04:43,359 --> 00:04:44,626
Thank you.

53
00:04:46,295 --> 00:04:48,428
- How you doing, kiddo?
- Linda.

54
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,630
How are you?

55
00:04:52,568 --> 00:04:56,169
You know, the funeral helped, I guess.
Just seeing him.

56
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,070
I thought you should
have been there.

57
00:04:58,072 --> 00:05:00,039
- I was outvoted.
- Get arrested!

58
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,344
- Die up your own ass for all I care!
- Richard.

59
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:05,080
He's not coming.

60
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,647
Ransom. Little shit.

61
00:05:07,649 --> 00:05:08,650
Missed the funeral.

62
00:05:09,318 --> 00:05:10,983
Excuse me.

63
00:05:10,985 --> 00:05:12,386
Uh, we're ready
for you now.

64
00:05:12,388 --> 00:05:14,121
We'd like to see you
one at a time.

65
00:05:14,123 --> 00:05:16,356
All right.
Uh, I'll go first.

66
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:18,392
I'm assuming this
will all be wrapped up

67
00:05:18,394 --> 00:05:20,193
before the
memorial tonight.

68
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:21,695
We'll do
our best, ma'am.

69
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,099
So...

70
00:05:26,101 --> 00:05:28,702
How you
doing, kiddo?

71
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:31,438
We're just gonna reintroduce
ourselves as a formality.

72
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,206
I am Detective
Lieutenant Elliot,

73
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,741
and this is
Trooper Wagner.

74
00:05:34,743 --> 00:05:38,211
Now, um,
I'm going to record this,

75
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,180
just to make things easier.

76
00:05:40,182 --> 00:05:43,750
All right, we're with
Linda Drysdale nee Thrombey,

77
00:05:43,752 --> 00:05:45,619
Harlan Thrombey's
eldest daughter,

78
00:05:45,621 --> 00:05:47,354
and discussing
the events that took place

79
00:05:47,356 --> 00:05:49,423
the night of his demise
one week ago.

80
00:05:49,425 --> 00:05:50,724
November eighth.

81
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:52,561
We're very sorry
for your loss.

82
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:56,730
Thank you.
That means a lot.

83
00:05:56,732 --> 00:05:58,665
So, we understand
on that night

84
00:05:58,667 --> 00:06:00,100
the family had gathered

85
00:06:00,102 --> 00:06:02,169
to celebrate your
father's 85th birthday?

86
00:06:02,171 --> 00:06:03,437
Yes.

87
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:06,239
- How was it? Uh...
- The party?

88
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:07,476
Pre-my-dad's-death?

89
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:10,210
Oh, it was great.

90
00:06:10,212 --> 00:06:12,479
Did anyone besides
the family show face?

91
00:06:12,481 --> 00:06:15,182
<i>Um, Fran,
the housekeeper.</i>

92
00:06:15,184 --> 00:06:18,151
He was a nice guy,
but he was so hairy.

93
00:06:18,153 --> 00:06:20,220
- Jacob?
- And I've dated Italian guys.

94
00:06:20,222 --> 00:06:22,088
You know what I mean?
It was like...

95
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,524
<i>Marta,
Harlan's caregiver.</i>

96
00:06:24,526 --> 00:06:26,660
<i>Good girl. Hard worker.</i>

97
00:06:26,662 --> 00:06:28,230
Her family's from Ecuador.

98
00:06:29,131 --> 00:06:30,730
And Wanetta.

99
00:06:30,732 --> 00:06:33,099
<i>Great nana. Harlan's mom.</i>

100
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,435
- Hi, Nana.
<i>- His mom?</i>

101
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:37,637
- Nana?
<i>- Wow. How old is she?</i>

102
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:39,439
<i>We have no idea.</i>

103
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,608
Okay, um,
and your son, Ransom,

104
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,410
<i>did he attend as well?</i>

105
00:06:43,412 --> 00:06:45,180
<i>Yes, but he left early.</i>

106
00:06:45,814 --> 00:06:49,318
Ransom, are you leaving?

107
00:06:54,223 --> 00:06:55,489
Right, um...

108
00:06:55,491 --> 00:06:57,224
Would you say that
all three of you showed up

109
00:06:57,226 --> 00:06:58,393
around the same time?

110
00:06:59,394 --> 00:07:00,729
No.

111
00:07:03,064 --> 00:07:06,600
Richard came early
to help the caterers set up.

112
00:07:06,602 --> 00:07:08,568
Okay. And you and
your husband, Richard,

113
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,203
work at a real estate
firm in Boston?

114
00:07:10,205 --> 00:07:12,472
No. It's...
It's my company.

115
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:14,107
Right. Right. Sorry.

116
00:07:14,109 --> 00:07:15,809
I built my business
from the ground up.

117
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:17,777
Oh, just like your father.

118
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:20,447
You two were very close.

119
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:23,817
We... We had our own secret
way of communicating.

120
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:27,187
I mean, you had to
find that with Dad.

121
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:29,222
You had to find a game
to play with him,

122
00:07:29,224 --> 00:07:32,661
and if you did that,
and you played by his rules...

123
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,201
Everyone idolizes
their dad, right?

124
00:07:41,203 --> 00:07:42,704
I don't know.
Do they?

125
00:07:44,106 --> 00:07:45,872
Very much not.

126
00:07:45,874 --> 00:07:47,741
Don't know why
I said that.

127
00:07:47,743 --> 00:07:50,143
<i>But my wife, Linda, does.</i>

128
00:07:50,145 --> 00:07:52,512
<i>Harlan started out
with a rusty Smith Corona</i>

129
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:53,847
<i>and built himself into</i>

130
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:56,783
<i>one of the best-selling
mystery writers of all time.</i>

131
00:07:56,785 --> 00:08:01,156
Wow, seems like all his kids
are self-made overachievers.

132
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:03,957
Sure.

133
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:06,593
For the record,
I'm speaking with Walt Thrombey,

134
00:08:06,595 --> 00:08:09,262
Harlan Thrombey's
youngest son.

135
00:08:09,264 --> 00:08:11,765
So, you run your father's
publishing company?

136
00:08:11,767 --> 00:08:14,301
Yeah. It's my...
It's our...

137
00:08:14,303 --> 00:08:16,369
Uh, it's the family's
publishing company.

138
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:17,606
Dad trusts me to run it.

139
00:08:18,774 --> 00:08:20,440
Thirty languages.

140
00:08:20,442 --> 00:08:24,311
Over 80 million copies sold.
A real legacy.

141
00:08:24,313 --> 00:08:26,179
Mmm-hmm.
- You guys fans?

142
00:08:26,181 --> 00:08:28,715
I mean, I don't do much
fiction reading myself, but...

143
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:30,417
Big fan.
I'm a big fan.

144
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:32,619
I mean,
his plots are just like...

145
00:08:32,621 --> 00:08:33,887
Like, I won't
spoil it for you but...

146
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:35,555
Okay, like
<i>Thousand Knives?</i>

147
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:36,890
<i>The Cow
and the Shotgun?</i>

148
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:39,359
Like, where do you
come up with that?

149
00:08:39,361 --> 00:08:40,894
Well, Dad said
the plots just

150
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:42,896
popped into his head,
fully formed.

151
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:44,464
It was the easy part for him.

152
00:08:46,602 --> 00:08:48,635
Um, so you're
in the area, right?

153
00:08:48,637 --> 00:08:51,338
Uh, you guys probably
arrived around the same time.

154
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,239
Uh...

155
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,675
We all got here
around 8:00.

156
00:08:55,677 --> 00:08:57,844
<i>My wife, Donna, she's my rock.</i>

157
00:08:59,615 --> 00:09:02,382
Jesus, Donna!
Are you all right?

158
00:09:02,384 --> 00:09:05,318
<i>My son, Jacob, he's 16.</i>

159
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,621
<i>Very politically active.</i>

160
00:09:07,623 --> 00:09:09,389
The boy is
literally a Nazi.

161
00:09:09,391 --> 00:09:11,725
He's an alt-right
troll dipshit.

162
00:09:11,727 --> 00:09:14,594
Kids today with the
Internet, it's amazing.

163
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,565
So the night went well?

164
00:09:18,734 --> 00:09:20,700
<i>I mean,
we're all gutted, but, uh,</i>

165
00:09:20,702 --> 00:09:22,936
<i>I was happy to have
that night with him.</i>

166
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:25,472
<i>To be by his side.
To think about our books</i>

167
00:09:25,474 --> 00:09:28,208
<i>and what we've accomplished
with them.</i>

168
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:30,879
It's like I can still feel
his hand on my shoulder.

169
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:34,347
Passing the torch.

170
00:09:34,349 --> 00:09:36,583
So, we're here
with Joni Thrombey,

171
00:09:36,585 --> 00:09:38,618
Harlan Thrombey's
daughter-in-law?

172
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,421
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, I married his son, Neil.

173
00:09:41,423 --> 00:09:43,523
We had one daughter, Meg.

174
00:09:43,525 --> 00:09:47,527
And then Neil passed on
15 years ago.

175
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:49,629
But you remained close
to the Thrombeys?

176
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:52,332
Oh! They're my family.

177
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,338
<i>I feel
simultaneously freed by</i>

178
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:01,408
<i>and supported by them.</i>

179
00:10:04,913 --> 00:10:08,350
It's that balance of opposites
that's the nugget of Flam.

180
00:10:09,017 --> 00:10:10,550
Sorry, the nugget of...

181
00:10:10,552 --> 00:10:11,918
Flam.

182
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,255
Oh. Yeah, Flam,
your skincare company. Sorry.

183
00:10:15,257 --> 00:10:16,458
I forgive you.

184
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:18,324
Yeah, it's skincare,

185
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,527
but it promotes a total
lifestyle.

186
00:10:20,529 --> 00:10:22,796
Self-sufficiency with
an acknowledgement

187
00:10:22,798 --> 00:10:24,030
of human need.

188
00:10:24,032 --> 00:10:25,398
That's Flam.

189
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,333
But it's also Harlan.

190
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,803
He got me and Meg
through some tough times.

191
00:10:29,805 --> 00:10:31,404
Grandad gives my mom
a yearly allowance

192
00:10:31,406 --> 00:10:32,839
and he's never missed wiring

193
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:34,876
a tuition payment
to my schools.

194
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:39,846
He's a genuinely
selfless man.

195
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:41,915
But you left
the party early?

196
00:10:41,917 --> 00:10:42,982
Have fun.

197
00:10:42,984 --> 00:10:44,284
<i>To see some friends at Smith.</i>

198
00:10:44,286 --> 00:10:46,052
You know Dad pays for her

199
00:10:46,054 --> 00:10:49,989
crypto-Marxist-post-
deconstructural-

200
00:10:49,991 --> 00:10:53,293
feminist-poetry-theory-
whatever major?

201
00:10:53,295 --> 00:10:55,595
She could have stuck
around for the cake.

202
00:10:55,597 --> 00:10:57,365
<i>I think Linda was upset.</i>

203
00:10:58,834 --> 00:10:59,935
Hmm.

204
00:11:01,303 --> 00:11:02,738
But Harlan understood.

205
00:11:07,076 --> 00:11:08,374
Right.

206
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:11,845
Um, you two showed up to the
party around the same time...

207
00:11:11,847 --> 00:11:14,013
If I could pause?

208
00:11:14,015 --> 00:11:15,016
Because I just...

209
00:11:15,917 --> 00:11:17,417
Who is that guy?

210
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:19,352
And why are we doing
all this again?

211
00:11:19,354 --> 00:11:20,653
This is just some
follow-up questions.

212
00:11:20,655 --> 00:11:22,089
Um, we're attempting
to be thorough,

213
00:11:22,091 --> 00:11:23,790
so we can figure out
the manner of death.

214
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:25,391
So by "manner of death,"

215
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,860
you mean if
someone killed him?

216
00:11:26,862 --> 00:11:28,895
If one of us killed him?

217
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:31,331
- One of his family killed him?
- No, no, Walt, Walt, no, no...

218
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:32,732
Is that what you're
suggesting, Lieutenant?

219
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:33,800
No one's
saying that, okay?

220
00:11:33,802 --> 00:11:35,470
This is all
pro-forma.

221
00:11:36,004 --> 00:11:37,005
Okay.

222
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:39,708
So who the fuck is that?

223
00:11:40,609 --> 00:11:41,674
Um...

224
00:11:41,676 --> 00:11:43,910
This is
Benoit Blanc.

225
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:46,713
- Benoit Blanc?
- Yes.

226
00:11:46,715 --> 00:11:48,515
Mr. Blanc is
a private investigator

227
00:11:48,517 --> 00:11:49,682
of great renown.

228
00:11:49,684 --> 00:11:50,950
Wait a minute.

229
00:11:50,952 --> 00:11:54,121
I read a tweet about a
<i>New Yorker</i> article about you.

230
00:11:54,123 --> 00:11:56,623
"The Last
of the Gentlemen Sleuths."

231
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,992
You solved that case
with the tennis champ?

232
00:11:58,994 --> 00:12:02,096
You're famous.

233
00:12:02,098 --> 00:12:04,397
Mr. Blanc is not
with the police department

234
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,999
and not officially involved
in the case,

235
00:12:06,001 --> 00:12:07,734
but he's offered to consult.

236
00:12:07,736 --> 00:12:10,069
Now, I happily obliged,
and I can vouch for him.

237
00:12:10,071 --> 00:12:11,971
Mr. Blanc,
I know who you are.

238
00:12:11,973 --> 00:12:13,907
I read your profile
in the <i>New Yorker.</i>

239
00:12:13,909 --> 00:12:16,409
I found it delightful.

240
00:12:16,411 --> 00:12:19,579
I just buried
my 85-year-old father

241
00:12:19,581 --> 00:12:21,548
who committed suicide.

242
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,950
Why are you here?

243
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:27,622
I'm here
at the behest of a client.

244
00:12:28,157 --> 00:12:29,391
Who?

245
00:12:30,659 --> 00:12:32,592
I cannot say.

246
00:12:32,594 --> 00:12:34,627
But let me assure you this.

247
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:38,031
My presence
will be ornamental.

248
00:12:38,033 --> 00:12:40,800
You will find me a respectful,

249
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:43,638
quiet, passive observer

250
00:12:44,739 --> 00:12:46,007
of the truth.

251
00:12:47,676 --> 00:12:49,042
Fine.

252
00:12:49,044 --> 00:12:50,543
Are we getting there?

253
00:12:50,545 --> 00:12:51,778
Nearly. Um...

254
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,047
Harlan's nurse,
she was at the party

255
00:12:54,049 --> 00:12:56,015
in a professional capacity?

256
00:12:56,017 --> 00:12:57,018
Marta?

257
00:12:57,786 --> 00:12:58,952
I guess.

258
00:12:58,954 --> 00:13:01,188
<i>Harlan hired her
to be around to take care</i>

259
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:03,590
<i>of whatever medical needs
popped up.</i>

260
00:13:03,592 --> 00:13:06,628
<i>But really,
she's like part of the family.</i>

261
00:13:07,028 --> 00:13:08,461
<i>Good kid.</i>

262
00:13:08,463 --> 00:13:10,097
<i>Been a good friend to Harlan.</i>

263
00:13:10,099 --> 00:13:12,031
<i>Family's from Paraguay.</i>

264
00:13:12,033 --> 00:13:14,103
Linda really likes
her work ethic.

265
00:13:15,637 --> 00:13:18,373
"Immigrants.
We get the job done."

266
00:13:20,942 --> 00:13:22,842
- I...
- From <i>Hamilton.</i>

267
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:24,510
Oh, <i>Hamilton.</i>

268
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,645
It's so good.
It's so good.

269
00:13:25,647 --> 00:13:27,449
- I saw it at The Public.
- Oh!

270
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,886
May I just, um...

271
00:13:31,653 --> 00:13:33,853
Then I'll recede, but...

272
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:35,924
As a self-made
man myself,

273
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:39,093
I have to express
my admiration

274
00:13:39,095 --> 00:13:41,696
for how you followed
in your father's footsteps.

275
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,899
- Thank you.
- Just marvelous.

276
00:13:45,901 --> 00:13:47,934
You know,
the whole family, too.

277
00:13:47,936 --> 00:13:49,903
And Joni with her thing,

278
00:13:49,905 --> 00:13:52,505
and Walt with his
publishing empire...

279
00:13:52,507 --> 00:13:53,708
It's...

280
00:13:54,643 --> 00:13:55,644
Well...

281
00:13:57,012 --> 00:14:00,080
Yes, I mean, Walt,
he's done well

282
00:14:00,082 --> 00:14:02,582
with what Dad gave him.

283
00:14:02,584 --> 00:14:03,616
Not that it matters.

284
00:14:03,618 --> 00:14:06,686
But really, Dad hands him
a book twice a year

285
00:14:06,688 --> 00:14:07,856
and Walt publishes it.

286
00:14:09,925 --> 00:14:11,057
It's just not the same.

287
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:15,262
But surely Walt runs the
merchandising, adaptations,

288
00:14:15,264 --> 00:14:17,497
film and television rights,
I mean...

289
00:14:17,499 --> 00:14:19,166
Are you baiting me, Detective?

290
00:14:20,702 --> 00:14:22,702
You know he doesn't.

291
00:14:22,704 --> 00:14:24,971
And if you think
I am dumb enough

292
00:14:24,973 --> 00:14:27,974
to be baited into
talking family business,

293
00:14:27,976 --> 00:14:30,543
into shit-talking
my baby brother,

294
00:14:30,545 --> 00:14:32,179
in front of
a police detective,

295
00:14:32,181 --> 00:14:33,713
and a state trooper...

296
00:14:33,715 --> 00:14:35,882
Walt doesn't run shit.

297
00:14:35,884 --> 00:14:38,551
Because there are no TV
and film rights.

298
00:14:38,553 --> 00:14:41,255
Harlan never allowed
any adaptations of his books.

299
00:14:41,257 --> 00:14:42,655
Hated the idea.

300
00:14:42,657 --> 00:14:43,756
No.

301
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,024
Yeah!

302
00:14:45,026 --> 00:14:46,726
Drives Walt nuts.

303
00:14:46,728 --> 00:14:48,828
'Cause that's where
the real money is.

304
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:51,198
When Walt would get
a little Irish courage in him,

305
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,133
- <i>he'd get into it with Harlan.</i>
- The window is...

306
00:14:53,135 --> 00:14:55,603
Did he "get into it"
at the party?

307
00:14:56,071 --> 00:14:57,603
Oh, my God!

308
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:58,771
Come on, Dad!

309
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,573
<i>Wouldn't leave
him alone, the poor guy.</i>

310
00:15:00,575 --> 00:15:02,109
<i>Harlan finally had
to give him the hook.</i>

311
00:15:02,111 --> 00:15:03,743
The Netflix guys,
their business affair guy...

312
00:15:03,745 --> 00:15:05,212
<i>I didn't hear
what he said,</i>

313
00:15:05,214 --> 00:15:07,714
<i>but he must've really
handed him his lunch.</i>

314
00:15:07,716 --> 00:15:11,285
<i>'Cause Walt was like a wounded
puppy the rest of the night.</i>

315
00:15:11,287 --> 00:15:12,819
What? Richard said what?

316
00:15:12,821 --> 00:15:14,821
No. Jesus.
We did not get "into it."

317
00:15:14,823 --> 00:15:18,325
I'm just trying to get
an accurate impression.

318
00:15:18,327 --> 00:15:20,693
Harlan took you aside
at the party.

319
00:15:20,695 --> 00:15:23,765
When you returned,
you were chastened.

320
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,570
What did Harlan say to you?

321
00:15:30,038 --> 00:15:32,272
The Netflix guys,
their business affair guy.

322
00:15:32,274 --> 00:15:34,208
He sent something over.
It's hard numbers this time,

323
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:35,975
and I just think
this is a window

324
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:37,744
that's not
gonna stay open.

325
00:15:37,746 --> 00:15:38,845
We need to take
advantage of it

326
00:15:38,847 --> 00:15:40,847
and then you just need
to look at the numbers!

327
00:15:40,849 --> 00:15:42,882
- Yeah, Walt, look...
- Dad! Dad!

328
00:15:42,884 --> 00:15:45,752
You... You put me
in charge of our books.

329
00:15:45,754 --> 00:15:48,654
Let me be in charge!
Let me do this! Please!

330
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:51,024
They're not
our books, son.

331
00:15:51,026 --> 00:15:53,160
They're my books.

332
00:15:53,162 --> 00:15:56,296
And this is not how I wanted
to have this conversation.

333
00:15:56,298 --> 00:15:58,831
But you're right,
you're right.

334
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:02,869
It's unfair of me
to keep you tethered

335
00:16:02,871 --> 00:16:05,772
to something that
isn't yours to control.

336
00:16:05,774 --> 00:16:06,839
What?

337
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:10,578
No, I've done you
a grave disservice.

338
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,213
All these years,

339
00:16:13,215 --> 00:16:15,882
I've kept you
from building something

340
00:16:15,884 --> 00:16:18,220
of your own
that was yours.

341
00:16:20,156 --> 00:16:22,822
But you're not
going to be running

342
00:16:22,824 --> 00:16:25,161
the publishing house
anymore.

343
00:16:25,927 --> 00:16:27,028
You're free of it.

344
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:29,030
Whoa...

345
00:16:30,732 --> 00:16:32,366
Dad, are you
firing me?

346
00:16:32,368 --> 00:16:34,634
No...

347
00:16:34,636 --> 00:16:36,172
We'll talk
details tomorrow.

348
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:38,640
My mind's made up.

349
00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:41,210
Good boy.

350
00:16:49,385 --> 00:16:52,887
We talked. We had a business
discussion about e-books.

351
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:56,092
Jesus. It was nothing.

352
00:16:57,359 --> 00:16:58,891
You want to talk
about an argument,

353
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:00,793
hell, Ransom had
an argument with him.

354
00:17:00,795 --> 00:17:01,961
Ransom, that's, uh,

355
00:17:01,963 --> 00:17:04,797
- Richard and Linda's son?
- Mmm.

356
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,769
Look, we all love Ransom,
he's a good kid. We love him.

357
00:17:09,871 --> 00:17:10,970
But?

358
00:17:10,972 --> 00:17:13,373
But he's always been
the black sheep of the family.

359
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:14,441
Ah.

360
00:17:14,443 --> 00:17:16,076
And I'm not trying to...

361
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:18,245
I like to keep stuff like this
in the family.

362
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:21,148
But with Ransom,
he's never had a job.

363
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,850
And Dad,
for some unknown reason,

364
00:17:23,852 --> 00:17:25,319
always supported him.

365
00:17:25,321 --> 00:17:28,690
They have this love-hate bond.
They fight.

366
00:17:29,858 --> 00:17:32,228
But that night, God,
they had a blowout.

367
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,094
About what?

368
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:35,928
Are you goddamn insane?

369
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,264
<i>We couldn't
make it out really,</i>

370
00:17:37,266 --> 00:17:39,065
<i>but it was huge.</i>

371
00:17:39,067 --> 00:17:42,169
<i>And it's strange they went
into another room to do it.</i>

372
00:17:42,171 --> 00:17:44,404
<i>Usually they like
to stoke up drama</i>

373
00:17:44,406 --> 00:17:46,706
<i>in front of the whole family.</i>

374
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,142
Speaking of getting into it...

375
00:17:49,545 --> 00:17:54,013
You were at the house early,
to help the caterers set up. Did...

376
00:17:54,015 --> 00:17:57,451
Did you converse with Harlan
at that time?

377
00:17:57,453 --> 00:17:59,919
Well, he was there.
We must have spoke.

378
00:17:59,921 --> 00:18:01,157
In his study?

379
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:05,325
I don't think so.

380
00:18:05,327 --> 00:18:08,395
You see, I spoke
with the caterer this morning,

381
00:18:08,397 --> 00:18:11,165
she didn't see you
helping her staff.

382
00:18:11,167 --> 00:18:13,866
She did hear Harlan
in a screaming match

383
00:18:13,868 --> 00:18:16,238
with somebody that afternoon
in his study.

384
00:18:17,071 --> 00:18:18,405
Yeah, I don't...

385
00:18:18,407 --> 00:18:20,209
- Screaming match?
- Mmm-hmm.

386
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:22,376
No.

387
00:18:22,378 --> 00:18:23,809
Um...

388
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,212
But Joni was here, too.

389
00:18:25,214 --> 00:18:27,813
Um, she was early,
so it might have been her.

390
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:28,948
You can maybe ask her.

391
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:31,118
These were two male voices.

392
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,052
<i>Harlan shouted the phrase...</i>

393
00:18:33,054 --> 00:18:35,257
You tell her or I will!

394
00:18:35,957 --> 00:18:37,226
"You tell her

395
00:18:38,327 --> 00:18:39,727
"or I will!"

396
00:18:41,796 --> 00:18:43,064
Bells ringing?

397
00:18:51,973 --> 00:18:53,407
That's none
of your business.

398
00:18:53,409 --> 00:18:54,408
You stay out
of my marriage.

399
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:57,544
I know my daughter,
and she would want to know.

400
00:18:57,546 --> 00:19:00,280
I've put all of it
in this letter to her.

401
00:19:00,282 --> 00:19:01,948
Tomorrow, she gets it.

402
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,816
Harlan, I'm warning you.

403
00:19:03,818 --> 00:19:05,352
- No, she deserves to know.
- You stay out of my marriage.

404
00:19:05,354 --> 00:19:07,454
She deserves to know,
and you're gonna tell her.

405
00:19:07,456 --> 00:19:10,292
- The hell I am!
- You tell her or I will!

406
00:19:13,262 --> 00:19:15,130
Yes. I know.

407
00:19:16,931 --> 00:19:17,997
Yes.

408
00:19:17,999 --> 00:19:20,866
Uh...

409
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:25,505
Harlan had finally decided to
put his mom in a nursing home

410
00:19:25,507 --> 00:19:27,907
and Linda had
always opposed that.

411
00:19:27,909 --> 00:19:29,276
And I wanted to wait
until we got back

412
00:19:29,278 --> 00:19:31,311
to Boston, uh, to tell Linda,

413
00:19:31,313 --> 00:19:34,181
so, to avoid a whole scene,

414
00:19:34,183 --> 00:19:37,018
and Harlan wanted me
to tell her then.

415
00:19:38,087 --> 00:19:40,153
That was it.

416
00:19:40,155 --> 00:19:41,457
Sorry. Forgot.

417
00:19:42,824 --> 00:19:44,324
The house?

418
00:19:44,326 --> 00:19:47,860
Uh, early.
Richard said you were there.

419
00:19:47,862 --> 00:19:50,031
I was at the house early.

420
00:19:50,965 --> 00:19:52,201
To see Harlan?

421
00:19:53,569 --> 00:19:54,869
To see Harlan.

422
00:19:55,404 --> 00:19:56,804
Yes.

423
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:00,307
What were you
seeing Harlan about?

424
00:20:00,309 --> 00:20:02,942
It was just a mix-up
with the, uh,

425
00:20:02,944 --> 00:20:05,011
the payment for Meg's tuition.

426
00:20:05,013 --> 00:20:06,280
I'm... I'm...

427
00:20:06,282 --> 00:20:07,949
I'm sorry to press,

428
00:20:09,184 --> 00:20:11,086
but what kind of mix-up?

429
00:20:12,887 --> 00:20:14,354
Yeah, the school hasn't
got the check yet.

430
00:20:14,356 --> 00:20:16,390
I don't know why Alan
didn't mail it.

431
00:20:16,392 --> 00:20:18,024
Well,
Alan didn't mail it

432
00:20:18,026 --> 00:20:21,228
because he caught
a discrepancy.

433
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:25,299
Alan's office has been wiring
tuition directly to the school

434
00:20:25,301 --> 00:20:26,999
as per your request.

435
00:20:27,001 --> 00:20:30,337
But Phyllis's office that
handles your yearly allowance

436
00:20:30,339 --> 00:20:34,143
has been wiring tuition monies
directly to you as well.

437
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:38,078
You have been double-dipping
Meg's tuition

438
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,413
and stealing from me.

439
00:20:39,415 --> 00:20:42,382
$100,000 a year,

440
00:20:42,384 --> 00:20:44,251
for the past four years.

441
00:20:44,253 --> 00:20:46,320
Harlan, I don't know
how this mix-up happened,

442
00:20:46,322 --> 00:20:47,953
but I swear to God...

443
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,889
So, now I am writing
this tuition check,

444
00:20:49,891 --> 00:20:52,292
but you must know
that this is the last money

445
00:20:52,294 --> 00:20:55,562
you or Meg will get from me.

446
00:20:55,564 --> 00:20:57,230
Please,
you don't understand...

447
00:20:57,232 --> 00:20:59,031
Joni, I know it'll hurt,

448
00:20:59,033 --> 00:21:00,935
but it's all for the best.

449
00:21:02,471 --> 00:21:04,005
My mind's made up.

450
00:21:07,008 --> 00:21:09,476
It was, uh,
a money wiring issue

451
00:21:09,478 --> 00:21:11,178
with the office at the school.

452
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:14,281
So I had to ask Harlan to cut
a check for the semester.

453
00:21:14,283 --> 00:21:15,584
Mmm. No big deal.

454
00:21:16,518 --> 00:21:17,584
Well...

455
00:21:17,586 --> 00:21:19,286
Why don't we,
uh, just take

456
00:21:19,288 --> 00:21:20,487
a little break
and we'll resu...

457
00:21:20,489 --> 00:21:22,054
Oh, no...

458
00:21:22,056 --> 00:21:23,158
She's gone.

459
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,201
Richard!

460
00:21:33,502 --> 00:21:35,034
Joni, have you
seen Richard?

461
00:21:35,036 --> 00:21:36,570
No, I was, uh,
just done with the, um...

462
00:21:36,572 --> 00:21:37,639
Okay, thanks.

463
00:21:39,408 --> 00:21:40,409
No.

464
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:42,877
Damn it. Richard!

465
00:21:44,979 --> 00:21:46,047
Richard?

466
00:22:15,544 --> 00:22:17,413
Son of a bitch.

467
00:22:27,723 --> 00:22:30,757
See, I might be a victim
of my own expectation here,

468
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:32,992
but when
the great Benoit Blanc

469
00:22:32,994 --> 00:22:34,494
comes knocking
at my door,

470
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,530
I expect it's going
to be about something,

471
00:22:36,532 --> 00:22:38,331
if not extraordinary,

472
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:40,667
then at least interesting.

473
00:22:40,669 --> 00:22:41,635
But... I'm sorry,

474
00:22:41,637 --> 00:22:45,070
this is an open-and-shut
case of suicide

475
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,606
and, uh, quite frankly, Benny,
we're getting to the point

476
00:22:46,608 --> 00:22:48,341
where I need to know
what we're doing here.

477
00:22:48,343 --> 00:22:49,344
The method?

478
00:22:51,045 --> 00:22:52,314
Throat slit?

479
00:22:53,248 --> 00:22:54,714
Typical for
a suicide?

480
00:22:54,716 --> 00:22:56,650
Yes, I mean,
that's dramatic.

481
00:22:56,652 --> 00:22:58,652
But look around.

482
00:22:58,654 --> 00:23:01,356
I mean, the guy practically
lives in a Clue board.

483
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:10,497
<i>Come on, Benny,
talk to me, all right?</i>

484
00:23:10,499 --> 00:23:13,166
<i>Now, you tell me to invite
all of these people back</i>

485
00:23:13,168 --> 00:23:15,735
<i>for questioning
all over again. I get it.</i>

486
00:23:15,737 --> 00:23:17,170
<i>Listen,
I've had boots on the ground</i>

487
00:23:17,172 --> 00:23:18,305
<i>in this county
for a while now.</i>

488
00:23:18,307 --> 00:23:19,573
<i>People are generally
what they seem to be.</i>

489
00:23:19,575 --> 00:23:21,608
<i>You're not gonna find
murderers in this family.</i>

490
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:23,042
<i>This is a pleasant family</i>

491
00:23:23,044 --> 00:23:24,277
<i>with the usual quarrels,</i>

492
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:26,313
<i>but no possible motives
for murder.</i>

493
00:23:26,315 --> 00:23:27,382
<i>Where are you going?</i>

494
00:23:32,354 --> 00:23:35,388
Harlan Thrombey's nurse.
Marta...

495
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:37,123
- Cabrera.
- Marta Cabrera. Please.

496
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:38,592
Miss Cabrera,
you can just wait inside

497
00:23:38,594 --> 00:23:40,262
- and we'll be with you in...
- Miss Cabrera.

498
00:23:43,365 --> 00:23:46,166
I've been doin'
a little pokin'.

499
00:23:46,168 --> 00:23:48,067
You were hired
on a part-time basis

500
00:23:48,069 --> 00:23:49,703
as a registered
nurse, yes?

501
00:23:49,705 --> 00:23:52,372
Uh, yes. I don't work for a VNA.

502
00:23:52,374 --> 00:23:54,140
Harlan hired
me directly.

503
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:56,176
Take a seat, please.

504
00:23:56,178 --> 00:23:58,480
And you're paid
a flat rate

505
00:23:59,781 --> 00:24:01,348
for how many hours a week?

506
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,582
Um...

507
00:24:02,584 --> 00:24:05,587
Well, I started at 15,
and then he...

508
00:24:06,688 --> 00:24:07,854
He needed more help.

509
00:24:07,856 --> 00:24:09,525
Medical help?

510
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,529
He needed a friend.

511
00:24:15,864 --> 00:24:20,567
Does having a kind heart
make you a good nurse?

512
00:24:20,569 --> 00:24:22,402
All right, Blanc,
I mean, this is...

513
00:24:22,404 --> 00:24:24,571
Yeah, yeah. Marta?
We were just discussing

514
00:24:24,573 --> 00:24:26,773
possible motives
in the family.

515
00:24:26,775 --> 00:24:29,309
I suspect that
Harlan has told you

516
00:24:29,311 --> 00:24:31,678
much unfiltered truth
about each of 'em.

517
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:35,115
And a little bird
has told me,

518
00:24:35,117 --> 00:24:37,286
how shall I
put this delicately...

519
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,455
You have
a regurgitative reaction

520
00:24:42,457 --> 00:24:44,326
to mistruthin'.

521
00:24:45,427 --> 00:24:46,860
Who told you that?

522
00:24:46,862 --> 00:24:48,495
Is it true?

523
00:24:48,497 --> 00:24:49,531
Uh...

524
00:24:50,732 --> 00:24:52,299
- Yes.
- Oh.

525
00:24:52,301 --> 00:24:54,801
It's something
I've had since I was a kid.

526
00:24:54,803 --> 00:24:57,170
It's a physical thing
that I...

527
00:24:57,172 --> 00:24:58,605
Just the thought of lying...

528
00:24:58,607 --> 00:25:01,274
Yeah, it makes me puke.

529
00:25:01,276 --> 00:25:02,642
Really?

530
00:25:06,548 --> 00:25:08,717
Is Richard havin' an affair?

531
00:25:13,255 --> 00:25:14,688
Why do men instinctively

532
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:18,260
pull at loose threads
on their parachutes?

533
00:25:19,494 --> 00:25:20,495
What?

534
00:25:28,203 --> 00:25:29,269
Richard?

535
00:25:29,271 --> 00:25:30,405
Mmm-hmm.

536
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:33,508
- An affair?
- Yeah.

537
00:25:34,343 --> 00:25:36,378
A yes or no will do.

538
00:25:38,647 --> 00:25:40,313
Mmm... No.

539
00:25:44,252 --> 00:25:45,819
Oh, shit!

540
00:25:45,821 --> 00:25:47,287
- Oh, my God!
- Dear girl, I'm sorry.

541
00:25:47,289 --> 00:25:49,789
- I assumed you were speaking figuratively.
- Here, have some water.

542
00:25:49,791 --> 00:25:52,192
- I have Wet-Naps in the car.
- All right, here, here.

543
00:25:52,194 --> 00:25:53,660
Just take a
sip of this.

544
00:25:53,662 --> 00:25:54,928
Take that.

545
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:57,230
- That's quite somethin'.
- Hmm?

546
00:25:57,232 --> 00:25:59,599
- Thanks.
- But I was obviously right.

547
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:01,201
Richard is having
an affair.

548
00:26:01,203 --> 00:26:03,436
His father-in-law found
out and confronted him.

549
00:26:03,438 --> 00:26:04,704
"You tell her
or I will."

550
00:26:04,706 --> 00:26:06,373
Okay, but even if
that were the case, he...

551
00:26:06,375 --> 00:26:07,641
You all right?

552
00:26:07,643 --> 00:26:08,708
Yeah.

553
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:09,776
Even if that were
the case, I mean,

554
00:26:09,778 --> 00:26:11,544
protecting a relationship
as a motive,

555
00:26:11,546 --> 00:26:13,279
that's weak sauce.
You know that.

556
00:26:13,281 --> 00:26:15,281
Well, then there
is Joni.

557
00:26:15,283 --> 00:26:16,516
- Joni?
- Joni?

558
00:26:16,518 --> 00:26:17,917
Lifestyle guru Joni?

559
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,519
No, Harlan was supporting
her and her daughter

560
00:26:19,521 --> 00:26:20,720
and that's the
opposite of a motive.

561
00:26:20,722 --> 00:26:22,355
And if that support
was threatened...

562
00:26:22,357 --> 00:26:23,623
Miss Cabrera,
one moment, please.

563
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:24,958
Yes, I just wanna
get some Scope.

564
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,226
Miss Cabrera...

565
00:26:27,396 --> 00:26:30,832
Was Harlan plannin' on
cutting off Joni's allowance?

566
00:26:33,602 --> 00:26:35,337
Oh, Joni.

567
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,739
What's up?

568
00:26:41,243 --> 00:26:42,308
Oh, my God.

569
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,410
All right, don't answer that

570
00:26:43,412 --> 00:26:44,711
if you're gonna
puke again, please.

571
00:26:44,713 --> 00:26:46,613
Meg said he paid
the school directly.

572
00:26:46,615 --> 00:26:48,350
Joni said he sent
the money to her.

573
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:50,483
Both were true.

574
00:26:50,485 --> 00:26:52,452
She was pocketing
the double payment.

575
00:26:52,454 --> 00:26:53,520
Harlan found out,

576
00:26:53,522 --> 00:26:54,988
and cut her off
without a cent.

577
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:55,989
Yes?

578
00:26:55,991 --> 00:26:59,592
So she bumps him off
for the inheritance?

579
00:26:59,594 --> 00:27:01,528
Come on, no,
have you seen her Insta?

580
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:02,662
She's an influencer.

581
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:04,497
No, allowance
as a motive?

582
00:27:04,499 --> 00:27:05,932
Again, more weak sauce.

583
00:27:05,934 --> 00:27:07,734
You're just dumpin' that vat
of weak sauce on me.

584
00:27:07,736 --> 00:27:09,738
Granted. But she
lied to me.

585
00:27:10,505 --> 00:27:11,905
All three of them did.

586
00:27:11,907 --> 00:27:12,908
Three?

587
00:27:14,543 --> 00:27:15,775
Walter.

588
00:27:15,777 --> 00:27:18,278
Ah. I see where you're
going with this.

589
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,980
Harlan had turned Walter down
before regarding film rights,

590
00:27:20,982 --> 00:27:23,583
but that night, somethin'
Harlan said shook him.

591
00:27:23,585 --> 00:27:25,351
Now we look at the pattern.

592
00:27:25,353 --> 00:27:27,222
Harlan was cleanin' house.

593
00:27:28,056 --> 00:27:29,257
No wonder.

594
00:27:30,492 --> 00:27:31,925
Did he plan to fire Walter?

595
00:27:31,927 --> 00:27:33,293
Can I just wait inside?

596
00:27:33,295 --> 00:27:34,360
I feel like
I shouldn't be here.

597
00:27:34,362 --> 00:27:35,562
Yeah, please,
just wait inside.

598
00:27:35,564 --> 00:27:36,898
Stay close, all right?

599
00:27:41,503 --> 00:27:43,805
You have been
very patient, my friend.

600
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,741
And yes,

601
00:27:46,508 --> 00:27:47,574
you are right.

602
00:27:47,576 --> 00:27:49,976
None of these weak alibis
and domestic squibbles

603
00:27:49,978 --> 00:27:51,711
answer your question...

604
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:54,914
"Why is Benoit Blanc here?"

605
00:27:54,916 --> 00:27:56,885
Well, now I will tell you why.

606
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:59,886
I'm here because this mornin',

607
00:27:59,888 --> 00:28:02,591
someone dodged
a very important question.

608
00:28:03,825 --> 00:28:04,826
Who?

609
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,094
Me.

610
00:28:07,096 --> 00:28:09,562
Linda asked
who hired me.

611
00:28:09,564 --> 00:28:10,999
Well, who hired you?

612
00:28:11,767 --> 00:28:14,467
I do not know.

613
00:28:14,469 --> 00:28:17,403
An envelope of cash showed up
at my apartment yesterday

614
00:28:17,405 --> 00:28:19,572
with a news clippin'
of Thrombey's death.

615
00:28:19,574 --> 00:28:20,942
An envelope?
That worked?

616
00:28:22,711 --> 00:28:25,745
- An envelope of cash.
- Hmm.

617
00:28:25,747 --> 00:28:28,082
So somebody
suspects foul play

618
00:28:28,084 --> 00:28:31,417
and goes through this
ha cha dance of hiring me,

619
00:28:31,419 --> 00:28:32,788
of staying anonymous.

620
00:28:33,588 --> 00:28:35,857
It makes no damn sense.

621
00:28:37,726 --> 00:28:39,027
Compels me, though.

622
00:28:40,962 --> 00:28:43,062
Walk me through
everyone's whereabouts

623
00:28:43,064 --> 00:28:44,065
at the time of death.

624
00:28:45,033 --> 00:28:48,835
We know that the party ended
around 11:30.

625
00:28:48,837 --> 00:28:49,769
- Good night, Joni.
- 'Night.

626
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:51,604
<i>Marta took Harlan upstairs</i>

627
00:28:51,606 --> 00:28:52,772
<i>to give him his meds.</i>

628
00:28:54,543 --> 00:28:57,111
<i>The stairs leading
up to Harlan's bedroom</i>

629
00:28:57,113 --> 00:28:59,646
<i>and his attic office
creak horribly</i>

630
00:28:59,648 --> 00:29:01,648
<i>and Linda is a light sleeper.</i>

631
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:02,649
<i>So we know every time</i>

632
00:29:02,651 --> 00:29:04,684
<i>someone took the stairs
that night.</i>

633
00:29:07,522 --> 00:29:09,856
<i>The first was
when Joni heard a ka-thunk</i>

634
00:29:09,858 --> 00:29:11,758
<i>from somewhere above her
in the house.</i>

635
00:29:20,969 --> 00:29:22,569
<i>She's concerned about Harlan,</i>

636
00:29:22,571 --> 00:29:24,737
<i>so she goes up
to investigate...</i>

637
00:29:26,007 --> 00:29:28,007
<i>Waking Linda.</i>

638
00:29:28,009 --> 00:29:30,476
<i>Harlan was in his attic office
with Marta.</i>

639
00:29:30,478 --> 00:29:31,878
- Hi, Joni.
- I just... Hi.

640
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,012
<i>He explained that
they had just</i>

641
00:29:33,014 --> 00:29:33,947
<i>knocked over the Go board.</i>

642
00:29:33,949 --> 00:29:35,316
I just knocked over
the Go board, so...

643
00:29:35,318 --> 00:29:37,684
<i>You know, that game
with the grid and stones?</i>

644
00:29:37,686 --> 00:29:38,918
<i>They play it every night.</i>

645
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,154
<i>He was fine. "Go to bed."</i>

646
00:29:40,156 --> 00:29:41,754
Go to bed, Joni.

647
00:29:41,756 --> 00:29:43,190
- Love you. 'Night.
- Love you.

648
00:29:43,192 --> 00:29:44,826
<i>- So she did.</i>
- Bye.

649
00:29:45,727 --> 00:29:47,060
<i>Ten minutes later,</i>

650
00:29:47,062 --> 00:29:48,995
<i>Linda is awoken
a second time...</i>

651
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,532
<i>By Marta leaving.</i>

652
00:29:52,534 --> 00:29:54,467
Walt, I'm leaving.

653
00:29:54,469 --> 00:29:57,070
<i>Walt was smokin' a cigar
on the porch with his son.</i>

654
00:29:57,072 --> 00:29:59,040
<i>He saw her leave
and drive off.</i>

655
00:30:00,076 --> 00:30:01,541
<i>Noted the time.</i>

656
00:30:01,543 --> 00:30:02,809
<i>Midnight.</i>

657
00:30:09,017 --> 00:30:10,284
<i>Fifteen minutes later,</i>

658
00:30:10,286 --> 00:30:13,052
<i>Linda is awoken for the third
and final time...</i>

659
00:30:15,857 --> 00:30:18,024
<i>By someone coming
down the stairs.</i>

660
00:30:18,026 --> 00:30:20,627
<i>Harlan, who came down
for a midnight snack.</i>

661
00:30:20,629 --> 00:30:22,162
Dad, go back to bed.

662
00:30:22,164 --> 00:30:24,166
<i>Which Walt tried
to discourage.</i>

663
00:30:25,033 --> 00:30:26,300
<i>Based on this,</i>

664
00:30:26,302 --> 00:30:28,102
<i>the medical examiner
determined the time of death</i>

665
00:30:28,104 --> 00:30:31,105
<i>to be between
12:15 and 2.00 a.m.</i>

666
00:30:31,107 --> 00:30:32,906
<i>As Walt was
finishing his cigar</i>

667
00:30:32,908 --> 00:30:35,008
<i>at about 12:30, Meg came home.</i>

668
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:36,743
<i>She went straight to bed.</i>

669
00:30:36,745 --> 00:30:39,646
<i>Walt and Jacob
turned in shortly after that.</i>

670
00:30:41,117 --> 00:30:43,483
<i>And sometime later that night,</i>

671
00:30:43,485 --> 00:30:46,519
<i>it's undetermined,
but possibly near 3:00 a.m.,</i>

672
00:30:46,521 --> 00:30:49,722
<i>Meg woke up because
the dogs were barking outside.</i>

673
00:30:49,724 --> 00:30:52,759
<i>She used the bathroom,
went back to bed.</i>

674
00:30:52,761 --> 00:30:54,661
That's it. All right?

675
00:30:54,663 --> 00:30:56,729
Now, everyone's
stories matched,

676
00:30:56,731 --> 00:30:58,466
every moment
accounted for.

677
00:30:59,168 --> 00:31:01,501
And there is
no other staircase

678
00:31:01,503 --> 00:31:02,702
up to Harlan's room?

679
00:31:02,704 --> 00:31:04,604
None. Just the creaky one.

680
00:31:04,606 --> 00:31:05,605
Interesting.

681
00:31:05,607 --> 00:31:08,708
So, uh, we know that
Ransom didn't do it

682
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:10,009
because he
wasn't there.

683
00:31:10,011 --> 00:31:11,577
Marta couldn't have.

684
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:13,247
Harlan was still alive
when she left.

685
00:31:13,249 --> 00:31:14,881
- Yeah.
- Meg...

686
00:31:14,883 --> 00:31:16,616
Meg came home
during the window

687
00:31:16,618 --> 00:31:17,684
- of the time of death, right?
- Now look, look, it was a...

688
00:31:17,686 --> 00:31:19,719
Except it was a suicide,
all right?

689
00:31:19,721 --> 00:31:21,821
Harlan slit right
through his carotid.

690
00:31:21,823 --> 00:31:23,623
We saw from
the blood splat patterns

691
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:25,024
that they
were uninterrupted,

692
00:31:25,026 --> 00:31:27,060
meaning, it's almost
impossible for anyone

693
00:31:27,062 --> 00:31:29,896
to have been around him
at the time.

694
00:31:29,898 --> 00:31:31,198
He's the one who cut his
own throat, all right?

695
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,765
I don't know why
we keep goin' over this.

696
00:31:32,767 --> 00:31:35,169
Physical evidence
can tell a clear story

697
00:31:35,171 --> 00:31:36,805
with a forked tongue.

698
00:31:37,572 --> 00:31:38,439
What?

699
00:31:38,441 --> 00:31:40,873
And as we can see
from this mornin',

700
00:31:40,875 --> 00:31:42,642
everyone can lie.

701
00:31:44,313 --> 00:31:45,712
Well,

702
00:31:45,714 --> 00:31:47,081
almost everyone.

703
00:31:49,684 --> 00:31:52,186
Miss Cabrera, um...

704
00:31:52,188 --> 00:31:53,953
We kept you waiting
all afternoon,

705
00:31:53,955 --> 00:31:57,191
because I wanted to hear
from you last.

706
00:31:57,193 --> 00:32:01,894
I needed an entire picture
of the evening in my head,

707
00:32:01,896 --> 00:32:05,567
and your piece of it
is at its very center.

708
00:32:06,701 --> 00:32:09,070
So, please
take your time.

709
00:32:11,072 --> 00:32:15,277
You took Mr. Thrombey
upstairs at 11:30

710
00:32:16,011 --> 00:32:18,245
and left at midnight.

711
00:32:18,247 --> 00:32:20,046
Think very carefully

712
00:32:20,048 --> 00:32:24,218
and with as much detail
as possible.

713
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:27,123
Tell us what happened
in that half hour?

714
00:32:32,161 --> 00:32:34,060
- Up, up, up, I got it.
- Yeah, you got it?

715
00:32:34,062 --> 00:32:36,662
Up, up, up, I got it.
Up, up, up, I got it.

716
00:32:36,664 --> 00:32:37,997
- Up, up, up, I got it.
- Okay, that's...

717
00:32:37,999 --> 00:32:39,899
- Up, up, up, I got it.
- Hey, Harlan...

718
00:32:39,901 --> 00:32:41,301
- Up, up, up, I got it.
- Let's...

719
00:32:41,303 --> 00:32:42,635
Up, up, up, I got it.

720
00:32:42,637 --> 00:32:44,637
- Okay.
- No second thoughts.

721
00:32:44,639 --> 00:32:46,273
No. No, no,
no, no.

722
00:32:46,275 --> 00:32:47,974
- Get up here!
- I had a glass of champagne.

723
00:32:47,976 --> 00:32:49,343
- Harlan, listen to me.
- We are...

724
00:32:49,345 --> 00:32:51,145
- It's late. I had...
- You've only had one glass.

725
00:32:51,147 --> 00:32:52,779
Exactly. A glass of champagne.
I don't...

726
00:32:52,781 --> 00:32:55,182
We are not breaking tradition
on my birthday!

727
00:32:55,184 --> 00:32:57,217
Can you just take your goddamn
medicine and go to bed?

728
00:32:57,219 --> 00:32:59,652
If you're gonna put that
vile shit in me,

729
00:32:59,654 --> 00:33:00,820
you have to earn it.

730
00:33:00,822 --> 00:33:02,622
On my birthday.

731
00:33:02,624 --> 00:33:04,023
- Oh, God.
- Eighty-fifth birthday.

732
00:33:04,025 --> 00:33:06,926
- Fine. Jesus!
- I'm so old.

733
00:33:06,928 --> 00:33:09,096
- I'm so old.
- You really love drama, huh?

734
00:33:09,098 --> 00:33:10,297
Oh, Marta.

735
00:33:10,299 --> 00:33:12,199
Okay, let's do this.
Nine-by-nine.

736
00:33:12,201 --> 00:33:13,333
- Right.
- You ready?

737
00:33:13,335 --> 00:33:15,001
- I'll whip your ass.
- Are you sure?

738
00:33:15,003 --> 00:33:16,303
Yeah. Yeah.

739
00:33:16,305 --> 00:33:17,605
How dare you.

740
00:33:20,242 --> 00:33:21,776
I know how this is gonna end.

741
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:24,777
What is that?

742
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:26,879
Why can't I beat you
at this game?

743
00:33:26,881 --> 00:33:28,082
Because I'm not playing
to beat you.

744
00:33:28,084 --> 00:33:29,715
I'm playing to build
a beautiful pattern.

745
00:33:29,717 --> 00:33:31,118
That's elder abuse.

746
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,819
I'm gonna call the AARP.

747
00:33:32,821 --> 00:33:34,421
Don't make me
get the belt, <i>abuelo.</i>

748
00:33:34,423 --> 00:33:36,057
It's basically over.

749
00:33:37,293 --> 00:33:39,295
My only hope is that
an earthquake will strike.

750
00:33:40,695 --> 00:33:41,963
But what are the chances?

751
00:33:42,964 --> 00:33:44,030
Uh-oh.

752
00:33:45,834 --> 00:33:46,899
Hello?

753
00:33:46,901 --> 00:33:48,402
Hello? Hello?

754
00:33:48,404 --> 00:33:49,971
Hello? Get under a door frame!

755
00:33:50,738 --> 00:33:51,739
Yes!

756
00:33:55,944 --> 00:33:58,746
Such a bad loser you are!
Meds, then bed.

757
00:33:59,348 --> 00:34:00,715
I'm done with you.

758
00:34:01,417 --> 00:34:03,119
That's fair.

759
00:34:05,887 --> 00:34:07,787
Walt is smoking
that filthy cigar

760
00:34:07,789 --> 00:34:08,955
out there on the porch.

761
00:34:08,957 --> 00:34:10,925
Dead and nasty things.

762
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,026
How was tonight?

763
00:34:14,028 --> 00:34:16,265
Tonight was, uh, good.

764
00:34:16,965 --> 00:34:18,298
Oh, yeah?

765
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,300
I know you weren't looking
forward to it.

766
00:34:20,302 --> 00:34:21,836
No. But I did it.

767
00:34:22,837 --> 00:34:24,906
I cut the line on
all four of 'em.

768
00:34:26,242 --> 00:34:27,243
Yeah.

769
00:34:27,976 --> 00:34:29,209
Wasn't easy.

770
00:34:29,211 --> 00:34:30,776
Mmm.

771
00:34:30,778 --> 00:34:32,314
This goddamn fortune.

772
00:34:34,416 --> 00:34:35,948
You know, sometimes I think

773
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:37,984
that everything I've
given my family,

774
00:34:37,986 --> 00:34:40,354
I've done maybe

775
00:34:40,356 --> 00:34:43,791
without knowing, or maybe
to keep them beneath me.

776
00:34:44,959 --> 00:34:47,327
I certainly should have...

777
00:34:47,329 --> 00:34:50,464
I don't know,
encouraged Walt

778
00:34:50,466 --> 00:34:52,934
to write his own stories,
not just be

779
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:55,968
a caretaker of mine.

780
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:58,105
Like you said I should.

781
00:34:58,107 --> 00:35:00,940
And then be a father
and not just a provider

782
00:35:00,942 --> 00:35:03,743
for Joni, like you
also said.

783
00:35:03,745 --> 00:35:06,346
And I could have been kinder
to Linda and Ransom...

784
00:35:07,416 --> 00:35:09,483
Jesus! Ransom.

785
00:35:10,952 --> 00:35:14,689
Oh, there's so much of me
in that kid.

786
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:17,393
Confident. Stupid.

787
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:21,195
I don't know, protected.

788
00:35:21,197 --> 00:35:25,700
Playing life like a game,
without consequence.

789
00:35:27,769 --> 00:35:29,837
Until you can't tell
the difference

790
00:35:30,539 --> 00:35:32,374
between a stage prop

791
00:35:33,542 --> 00:35:35,244
and a real knife.

792
00:35:36,378 --> 00:35:38,046
You know, I don't
fear death.

793
00:35:38,913 --> 00:35:40,947
But, oh, God,

794
00:35:40,949 --> 00:35:44,384
I'd like to fix some
of this before I go.

795
00:35:44,386 --> 00:35:46,488
Close the book
with a flourish.

796
00:35:49,558 --> 00:35:52,125
I guess we'll see. Hmm?

797
00:35:52,127 --> 00:35:53,362
I guess we will.

798
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,467
Hey.

799
00:36:00,469 --> 00:36:01,769
You had a long day.

800
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:04,005
You wanna do drugs?

801
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,072
You mean the good stuff?

802
00:36:06,074 --> 00:36:07,507
Yeah?

803
00:36:07,509 --> 00:36:11,411
Oh, come on,
send me to la-la land.

804
00:36:11,413 --> 00:36:13,980
Just a tiny bit, okay?

805
00:36:13,982 --> 00:36:17,184
Why did I wait till my mid-age
to become a morphine user?

806
00:36:17,186 --> 00:36:19,051
What a schmuck.

807
00:36:19,053 --> 00:36:21,321
What a nudnik.
This...

808
00:36:21,323 --> 00:36:23,125
This stuff
is the best.

809
00:36:28,497 --> 00:36:29,831
Oh, my God.

810
00:36:31,065 --> 00:36:32,401
Is there a problem?

811
00:36:35,104 --> 00:36:37,473
This is what I just gave you
100 milligrams of.

812
00:36:39,408 --> 00:36:41,141
I messed up.

813
00:36:41,143 --> 00:36:44,213
You gave me 100 milligrams
of the good stuff?

814
00:36:46,482 --> 00:36:50,584
Excuse me, what is the good
stuff's dosage supposed to be?

815
00:36:50,586 --> 00:36:52,918
Let's not call it that
right now, okay?

816
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,020
Three milligrams.

817
00:36:54,022 --> 00:36:55,190
Oh, that's much less.

818
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:57,524
So what happens?

819
00:36:57,526 --> 00:37:00,160
I'm gonna give you
an emergency shot of Naloxone,

820
00:37:00,162 --> 00:37:01,961
so you don't die
in 10 minutes.

821
00:37:01,963 --> 00:37:03,198
Oh, well, no pressure.

822
00:37:04,932 --> 00:37:06,500
You know, this is
an interesting

823
00:37:06,502 --> 00:37:09,136
and efficient
method of murder.

824
00:37:09,138 --> 00:37:11,171
I need to write this down.

825
00:37:11,173 --> 00:37:14,907
So, if someone switched
the meds on purpose,

826
00:37:14,909 --> 00:37:16,378
I'd be dead in 10 minutes.

827
00:37:17,246 --> 00:37:19,279
- Like stone-cold dead?
- Yes.

828
00:37:19,281 --> 00:37:20,880
You'll feel symptoms in five.

829
00:37:20,882 --> 00:37:23,483
Sweats, disorientation,
and then...

830
00:37:23,485 --> 00:37:27,087
Yes. That big dose injected,
within 10, your...

831
00:37:27,089 --> 00:37:29,323
Your brain...

832
00:37:29,325 --> 00:37:31,124
Yes, 10 minutes.

833
00:37:31,126 --> 00:37:32,526
From the moment of injection?

834
00:37:32,528 --> 00:37:34,561
It's eight-ish now.

835
00:37:34,563 --> 00:37:37,297
And even if the victim called
for an ambulance

836
00:37:37,299 --> 00:37:38,964
when he first
felt the symptoms

837
00:37:38,966 --> 00:37:42,369
and if he lived in a great
big country house like we do,

838
00:37:42,371 --> 00:37:46,340
the ambulance would take
at least 15 minutes to arrive

839
00:37:46,342 --> 00:37:49,008
and it'd be too late.

840
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:52,548
If the victim didn't have
the emergency Naxostuff.

841
00:37:53,981 --> 00:37:55,047
Marta?

842
00:37:56,552 --> 00:37:59,686
- Do you have the Naxostuff?
- Yes, I'm gonna find it.

843
00:37:59,688 --> 00:38:02,054
I have it because
it comes with the kit,

844
00:38:02,056 --> 00:38:03,891
so it should be here.
It has to be.

845
00:38:04,393 --> 00:38:05,394
It's like...

846
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:17,304
It's not here, Harlan.

847
00:38:17,306 --> 00:38:19,339
I don't know why
it's not here.

848
00:38:19,341 --> 00:38:21,008
So, I'm gonna
use the phone, okay?

849
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:23,112
To call an ambulance.

850
00:38:36,558 --> 00:38:38,059
What are you doing?

851
00:38:39,728 --> 00:38:41,130
What are you doing?

852
00:38:43,064 --> 00:38:45,165
Marta, listen to me.

853
00:38:45,167 --> 00:38:46,233
Harlan, I need to call
the ambulance.

854
00:38:46,235 --> 00:38:47,334
Stop this! Stop this, Marta!

855
00:38:47,336 --> 00:38:48,435
- They need to get here.
- There's no time!

856
00:38:48,437 --> 00:38:49,503
- You have to...
- You have to listen!

857
00:38:49,505 --> 00:38:51,003
I'm calling the family!

858
00:38:55,344 --> 00:38:56,676
What are you doing?

859
00:38:56,678 --> 00:38:58,545
- Are you nuts?
- Don't make a noise.

860
00:38:58,547 --> 00:39:00,180
- Harlan, we have to call the ambulance.
- Marta, listen to me!

861
00:39:00,182 --> 00:39:01,248
We don't have time!

862
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:02,449
- What's going on?
- Listen to me!

863
00:39:02,451 --> 00:39:04,418
Now, if what you said
is true, I'm gone.

864
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,552
There's no saving me.

865
00:39:05,554 --> 00:39:06,620
No, no.

866
00:39:06,622 --> 00:39:08,053
We have six minutes.

867
00:39:08,055 --> 00:39:09,289
- No, I can't...
- Wait, no.

868
00:39:09,291 --> 00:39:11,124
We have got to get you
out of this!

869
00:39:11,126 --> 00:39:12,494
Think of your mom.

870
00:39:13,095 --> 00:39:14,161
My mom?

871
00:39:15,431 --> 00:39:17,431
Marta, get behind me,
get behind me.

872
00:39:17,433 --> 00:39:18,567
Don't make a noise.

873
00:39:19,568 --> 00:39:20,569
Harlan?

874
00:39:21,403 --> 00:39:22,636
Marta?

875
00:39:22,638 --> 00:39:24,271
Everything all right?

876
00:39:24,273 --> 00:39:26,773
- Oh, hi, Joni.
- I thought I... Hi.

877
00:39:26,775 --> 00:39:28,775
I thought I heard something.
Is everything okay?

878
00:39:28,777 --> 00:39:30,710
No, no.
We're fine. We're fine.

879
00:39:30,712 --> 00:39:34,681
Well, I just knocked over this Go board.
Sorry about that.

880
00:39:34,683 --> 00:39:36,716
- Everyone's all right?
- Yeah, fine.

881
00:39:36,718 --> 00:39:39,219
No, no.
Go to bed, Joni.

882
00:39:39,221 --> 00:39:40,787
Okay.

883
00:39:40,789 --> 00:39:43,290
Maybe we can talk tomorrow
about the family...

884
00:39:43,292 --> 00:39:44,658
Tomorrow's fine.

885
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:47,596
- Goodnight. Love you. 'Night.
- Love you. Bye.

886
00:39:51,133 --> 00:39:52,134
Come on.

887
00:39:53,502 --> 00:39:54,670
Pay attention, now.

888
00:39:55,437 --> 00:39:57,137
Your mom

889
00:39:57,139 --> 00:39:59,071
is still undocumented.

890
00:39:59,073 --> 00:40:00,507
And if this is your fault,

891
00:40:00,509 --> 00:40:03,210
she'll be found out
and at best deported

892
00:40:03,212 --> 00:40:05,278
and your family
will be broken.

893
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,381
We're not gonna let that
happen, are we, huh?

894
00:40:08,383 --> 00:40:11,384
But you have to do exactly
what I tell you.

895
00:40:11,386 --> 00:40:13,522
Will you do this,
Marta? Hmm?

896
00:40:14,623 --> 00:40:15,990
This last thing

897
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:17,824
for me?

898
00:40:17,826 --> 00:40:19,026
For your family?

899
00:40:22,731 --> 00:40:23,899
What do you want me to do?

900
00:40:26,067 --> 00:40:28,802
<i>Go downstairs
as noisily as you can</i>

901
00:40:28,804 --> 00:40:30,437
<i>and then say goodbye loudly.</i>

902
00:40:30,439 --> 00:40:31,505
Walt, I'm leaving.

903
00:40:31,507 --> 00:40:33,106
<i>Call attention
to the time...</i>

904
00:40:33,108 --> 00:40:34,407
God, it's midnight already.

905
00:40:34,409 --> 00:40:35,477
<i>If you can.</i>

906
00:40:36,845 --> 00:40:38,578
<i>Drive out the gate.</i>

907
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,547
<i>Then to avoid
the security cameras,</i>

908
00:40:40,549 --> 00:40:43,585
<i>pull off the road before
the carved elephant.</i>

909
00:40:44,753 --> 00:40:46,653
Wait.
Was it before or after?

910
00:40:46,655 --> 00:40:48,421
<i>After the carved elephant.</i>

911
00:40:48,423 --> 00:40:50,223
No, he said before.
Was it?

912
00:40:50,225 --> 00:40:52,225
<i>Beafterfore
the carved elephant.</i>

913
00:40:52,227 --> 00:40:53,328
Oh, shit.

914
00:40:56,765 --> 00:41:01,334
<i>Park, and come back
on foot up to the house.</i>

915
00:41:01,336 --> 00:41:05,138
<i>Take the side yard pass
through the little gate.</i>

916
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:07,507
<i>The dogs will know you,
they shouldn't bark.</i>

917
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:11,244
<i>You've got to get up
to the third floor</i>

918
00:41:11,246 --> 00:41:12,445
<i>without being seen.</i>

919
00:41:12,447 --> 00:41:14,848
<i>And the only way
is to climb the side trellis</i>

920
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:17,851
<i>and come in through
the trick hall window.</i>

921
00:41:17,853 --> 00:41:19,252
You gotta be kidding me.

922
00:41:19,254 --> 00:41:21,321
<i>I am not. Do it.</i>

923
00:41:29,765 --> 00:41:32,899
<i>And for God's sake,
don't make any noise!</i>

924
00:41:43,178 --> 00:41:46,179
<i>Once you're inside,
now this is the tricky part...</i>

925
00:41:46,181 --> 00:41:47,614
<i>This is the tricky part?</i>

926
00:41:47,616 --> 00:41:50,850
<i>Get my robe and cap
from my bedroom</i>

927
00:41:50,852 --> 00:41:52,419
<i>and put them on.</i>

928
00:41:52,421 --> 00:41:53,453
<i>Harlan...</i>

929
00:41:53,455 --> 00:41:55,555
This is crazy.
I don't think I can do that.

930
00:41:55,557 --> 00:41:57,357
No, we need to make this
so airtight

931
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:58,291
that the average cop

932
00:41:58,293 --> 00:42:00,827
will entirely dismiss you
as a suspect.

933
00:42:00,829 --> 00:42:03,231
It sounds crazy,
but it'll work.

934
00:42:07,869 --> 00:42:10,606
<i>Walt is smoking outside,
and he'll see you</i>

935
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,273
<i>through the glazed window.</i>

936
00:42:13,275 --> 00:42:15,377
Dad? Go back to bed.

937
00:42:16,678 --> 00:42:18,345
<i>You were seen leaving.</i>

938
00:42:18,347 --> 00:42:21,348
<i>The security cameras
show you driving off.</i>

939
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:22,549
<i>And 20 minutes later,</i>

940
00:42:22,551 --> 00:42:25,552
<i>I'm seen alive and well
by my son.</i>

941
00:42:25,554 --> 00:42:26,586
<i>You see,</i>

942
00:42:26,588 --> 00:42:29,222
<i>you've gone from suspect
number one</i>

943
00:42:29,224 --> 00:42:30,890
<i>to an impossibility.</i>

944
00:42:30,892 --> 00:42:32,792
<i>Leave the way you came</i>

945
00:42:32,794 --> 00:42:35,631
<i>and don't be seen.</i>

946
00:42:46,208 --> 00:42:47,509
Ransom?

947
00:42:48,977 --> 00:42:51,279
Are you back
again already?

948
00:42:54,683 --> 00:42:56,483
<i>Drive home.</i>

949
00:42:56,485 --> 00:42:58,585
<i>And sometime
in the next few days</i>

950
00:42:58,587 --> 00:43:00,720
<i>the police will question you.</i>

951
00:43:00,722 --> 00:43:03,490
No. No, no, no. No!

952
00:43:03,492 --> 00:43:05,425
I can't lie!

953
00:43:05,427 --> 00:43:07,427
You know I can't lie!
I'll puke!

954
00:43:07,429 --> 00:43:10,263
Well, then don't lie.
Tell fragments of the truth.

955
00:43:10,265 --> 00:43:11,698
In this exact order.

956
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,409
I took him upstairs.

957
00:43:21,643 --> 00:43:23,745
We played our nightly
game of Go.

958
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:27,981
At some point,
he knocked the board over

959
00:43:27,983 --> 00:43:31,186
and Joni came up
to check on us.

960
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:32,954
Um...

961
00:43:34,723 --> 00:43:36,458
I gave him pain medication.

962
00:43:37,459 --> 00:43:39,928
He pulled his shoulder
last week.

963
00:43:40,395 --> 00:43:41,528
Um...

964
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:43,865
And I left him
in his study.

965
00:43:44,599 --> 00:43:45,865
At midnight

966
00:43:45,867 --> 00:43:47,269
I said goodbye
to Walt,

967
00:43:49,438 --> 00:43:50,403
went home.

968
00:43:50,405 --> 00:43:52,574
What kind of medication
did you give him?

969
00:43:55,777 --> 00:43:57,711
Since his injury,
I've been giving him

970
00:43:57,713 --> 00:44:00,880
a 100 milligram IV push
of Toradol.

971
00:44:00,882 --> 00:44:03,283
It's a non-narcotic analgesic.

972
00:44:03,285 --> 00:44:05,018
And to help him sleep,

973
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:07,620
three milligrams
of morphine.

974
00:44:07,622 --> 00:44:09,489
And the family
was aware of this?

975
00:44:09,491 --> 00:44:10,824
Yes, of course.

976
00:44:10,826 --> 00:44:12,992
Did you notice
anything strange

977
00:44:12,994 --> 00:44:14,696
or off about his demeanor?

978
00:44:18,567 --> 00:44:19,601
No.

979
00:44:23,472 --> 00:44:25,540
Well, that sounds
about right.

980
00:44:26,875 --> 00:44:28,744
Thank you, Miss Cabrera.

981
00:44:46,962 --> 00:44:49,596
Hey, sis, people are
gonna start getting here

982
00:44:49,598 --> 00:44:50,897
for the memorial pretty soon.

983
00:44:50,899 --> 00:44:51,900
Are you...

984
00:44:54,402 --> 00:44:56,603
Are you all right?

985
00:44:56,605 --> 00:44:58,907
I was just thinking
about Dad's games.

986
00:45:00,642 --> 00:45:02,577
This all feels like one.

987
00:45:03,578 --> 00:45:06,047
Like something he'd write,
not do.

988
00:45:07,116 --> 00:45:09,918
I keep waiting for
the big reveal.

989
00:45:11,787 --> 00:45:14,053
Where it'll make sense.

990
00:45:14,055 --> 00:45:15,624
Wouldn't that be nice?

991
00:45:16,758 --> 00:45:17,893
Oh, Walt.

992
00:45:21,062 --> 00:45:22,898
<i>I don't think
he killed himself.</i>

993
00:45:23,632 --> 00:45:25,698
I don't. I really don't.

994
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:27,367
There's this
Hallmark movie

995
00:45:27,369 --> 00:45:29,669
called <i>Deadly by Surprise</i>
with Danica McKellar.

996
00:45:29,671 --> 00:45:31,105
And in it, she plays
this wife

997
00:45:31,107 --> 00:45:33,540
who's getting poisoned
by her husband,

998
00:45:33,542 --> 00:45:35,142
but he's doing it
little by little,

999
00:45:35,144 --> 00:45:36,110
so she doesn't know it

1000
00:45:36,112 --> 00:45:38,845
and she goes crazy,
and she kills herself.

1001
00:45:38,847 --> 00:45:40,713
And my cousin,
who's a receptionist

1002
00:45:40,715 --> 00:45:42,482
at the medical
examiner's office,

1003
00:45:42,484 --> 00:45:44,517
she says that stuff
totally happens.

1004
00:45:44,519 --> 00:45:46,052
It's not even 3% as crazy

1005
00:45:46,054 --> 00:45:47,720
as the stuff she's seen
come through there.

1006
00:45:47,722 --> 00:45:48,824
So, I'm just like...

1007
00:45:50,392 --> 00:45:51,991
Oh, God, yeah!

1008
00:45:51,993 --> 00:45:54,161
I mean, don't like him
because you love him.

1009
00:45:54,163 --> 00:45:57,030
No, I don't like him,
he's an asshole.

1010
00:45:57,032 --> 00:45:59,432
But maybe an asshole
is what we needed.

1011
00:45:59,434 --> 00:46:01,000
Oh, my God, yeah,

1012
00:46:01,002 --> 00:46:02,735
an asshole is what
Germany needed

1013
00:46:02,737 --> 00:46:04,804
- in 1930-whatever.
- Here we go.

1014
00:46:04,806 --> 00:46:06,773
Come on, Joni, those two
things don't even conflate.

1015
00:46:06,775 --> 00:46:08,474
- There is the problem...
- Oh, Jesus.

1016
00:46:08,476 --> 00:46:09,609
You do not care
about anybody's feelings...

1017
00:46:09,611 --> 00:46:12,112
I'm gonna disappear until
the politics talk is done.

1018
00:46:12,114 --> 00:46:14,514
- You, my friend...
- You want some champers?

1019
00:46:14,516 --> 00:46:16,416
I can't.
I'm technically working.

1020
00:46:16,418 --> 00:46:18,152
Why don't you take off
your red cap, Richard,

1021
00:46:18,154 --> 00:46:19,186
and look around you?

1022
00:46:19,188 --> 00:46:21,654
The streets are literally
flooded with Nazis.

1023
00:46:21,656 --> 00:46:22,689
No, no, no. No, no, no.

1024
00:46:22,691 --> 00:46:25,992
We are losing our way of life
and our culture.

1025
00:46:25,994 --> 00:46:27,026
That's right.

1026
00:46:27,028 --> 00:46:28,728
There are millions
of Mexicans coming.

1027
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:30,130
- Oh, God, really?
- Don't make this a race thing.

1028
00:46:30,132 --> 00:46:31,731
You always make this
a race thing.

1029
00:46:31,733 --> 00:46:33,100
- Yeah, this is not about race.
- I would say the same thing

1030
00:46:33,102 --> 00:46:34,534
if they were
European immigrants.

1031
00:46:34,536 --> 00:46:36,502
Oh, yeah? So, if the
Swiss were, like,

1032
00:46:36,504 --> 00:46:38,538
- clogging in the streets...
- No. No, no, we allow them in

1033
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:40,773
and they think
they own what's ours.

1034
00:46:40,775 --> 00:46:42,976
They're putting children
in cages!

1035
00:46:42,978 --> 00:46:44,144
- I mean, these are camps!
- Yes.

1036
00:46:44,146 --> 00:46:45,511
Come on, Joni,

1037
00:46:45,513 --> 00:46:46,980
nobody's saying that isn't bad,

1038
00:46:46,982 --> 00:46:48,915
but the parents have
some blame here.

1039
00:46:48,917 --> 00:46:51,651
Oh, for what? For wanting
a better life for their kids?

1040
00:46:51,653 --> 00:46:54,221
- Isn't that what America is...
- For breaking the law!

1041
00:46:54,223 --> 00:46:55,155
My God.

1042
00:46:55,157 --> 00:46:56,022
And you're gonna
hate hearing this,

1043
00:46:56,024 --> 00:46:58,725
but it's true,
America is for Americans.

1044
00:46:58,727 --> 00:46:59,959
Don't point at me.

1045
00:46:59,961 --> 00:47:01,128
Where's Marta?
Is she still here?

1046
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:02,662
- Oh, God, don't.
- Marta!

1047
00:47:02,664 --> 00:47:03,963
- Come on over.
- No, Richard.

1048
00:47:03,965 --> 00:47:05,232
Come on over, Marta.
Please, come over.

1049
00:47:05,234 --> 00:47:06,499
You're shitting me.

1050
00:47:06,501 --> 00:47:07,867
Marta,

1051
00:47:07,869 --> 00:47:11,838
your family is from Uruguay,
but you did it right.

1052
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:14,241
I mean, what I'm saying is
they did it legally.

1053
00:47:14,243 --> 00:47:15,610
She did it the right way.

1054
00:47:16,212 --> 00:47:17,677
You work hard,

1055
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:20,480
and you'll earn your share
from the ground up.

1056
00:47:20,482 --> 00:47:22,882
Just like Dad
and like all the rest of us.

1057
00:47:22,884 --> 00:47:24,817
And I'll bet you
agree with me, right?

1058
00:47:24,819 --> 00:47:27,087
Oh, just leave the poor girl
alone, Richard.

1059
00:47:27,089 --> 00:47:29,689
It's okay! I just wanna
hear what she has to say!

1060
00:47:29,691 --> 00:47:30,823
It's okay, Marta,
you can speak.

1061
00:47:30,825 --> 00:47:32,159
Oh, sweetheart,
don't feel pressure to answer.

1062
00:47:32,161 --> 00:47:33,793
- This is just a...
- Look...

1063
00:47:33,795 --> 00:47:34,894
- Please don't.
- If you wanna

1064
00:47:34,896 --> 00:47:36,663
become an American,

1065
00:47:36,665 --> 00:47:39,099
there are legal
ways to do it.

1066
00:47:39,101 --> 00:47:40,633
But if you break the law,

1067
00:47:40,635 --> 00:47:43,069
it doesn't matter
how good your heart is,

1068
00:47:43,071 --> 00:47:45,905
you gotta face
the consequences!

1069
00:47:45,907 --> 00:47:47,540
Are you goddamn insane?

1070
00:47:47,542 --> 00:47:49,744
- It's done.
- Hey! I'm warning you.

1071
00:47:54,883 --> 00:47:56,783
That's when I ask her,
I'm like,

1072
00:47:56,785 --> 00:47:57,951
"Tonya, what is wrong
with people?"

1073
00:47:57,953 --> 00:47:59,652
Literally.

1074
00:47:59,654 --> 00:48:02,021
Oh, my God!
Marta, what?

1075
00:48:02,023 --> 00:48:03,523
Marta?

1076
00:48:03,525 --> 00:48:04,657
What's the matter?

1077
00:48:04,659 --> 00:48:06,859
Whoa, whoa.
Hey. Breathe.

1078
00:48:06,861 --> 00:48:09,862
- Oh, my gosh.
- Marta, are you okay?

1079
00:48:09,864 --> 00:48:12,101
Hey, Fran, do you still
have your stash?

1080
00:48:17,639 --> 00:48:19,072
Take 'em whenever
you need 'em.

1081
00:48:19,074 --> 00:48:21,708
They're just drying out
since you gave me that Juul.

1082
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:23,077
Thanks, Fran.

1083
00:48:23,079 --> 00:48:24,978
- Hey. Hey.
- I'm sorry.

1084
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:26,080
- No, just... No, stop...
- I'm sorry.

1085
00:48:26,082 --> 00:48:27,580
I'm just very, very sorry.

1086
00:48:27,582 --> 00:48:29,183
Stop saying
you're sorry. Jesus!

1087
00:48:29,185 --> 00:48:31,318
I hate this. Oh, God,
my heart won't stop...

1088
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:32,585
I can't...

1089
00:48:33,822 --> 00:48:35,724
It's just everything...
No, thank you.

1090
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:40,660
That's where Fran
keeps her stash?

1091
00:48:42,164 --> 00:48:43,698
Who's gonna
open a clock?

1092
00:48:45,267 --> 00:48:47,301
Do you want
dinner, Nana?

1093
00:48:47,303 --> 00:48:49,635
Dinner? To eat?

1094
00:48:49,637 --> 00:48:51,637
- To eat?
- Walt?

1095
00:48:51,639 --> 00:48:53,107
- Nana?
- Walt, Walt, she's fine.

1096
00:48:53,109 --> 00:48:55,211
She ate the entire
salmon spread already.

1097
00:48:57,079 --> 00:48:59,846
Walt? Did you tell Marta yet,
what we all talked about?

1098
00:48:59,848 --> 00:49:01,748
No, not yet.
Is now a good time?

1099
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:03,950
Yes. Yes, a very good
time, right now.

1100
00:49:03,952 --> 00:49:05,285
Oh, okay.

1101
00:49:05,287 --> 00:49:07,223
All right. Calm down.

1102
00:49:09,624 --> 00:49:11,191
Marta,

1103
00:49:11,193 --> 00:49:13,795
we've been
talking it over and, uh...

1104
00:49:15,264 --> 00:49:18,031
- Have you been smoking grass?
- No.

1105
00:49:18,033 --> 00:49:19,999
- Mmm-hmm.
- Come on.

1106
00:49:20,001 --> 00:49:21,768
Marta, we've been
talking it over,

1107
00:49:21,770 --> 00:49:24,204
and, uh,
the whole family,

1108
00:49:24,206 --> 00:49:26,108
we'd like to take
care of you.

1109
00:49:27,809 --> 00:49:28,910
What does that mean?

1110
00:49:30,112 --> 00:49:32,146
We all think that
you deserve something.

1111
00:49:32,148 --> 00:49:34,747
Financially,
we'd like to help you out.

1112
00:49:34,749 --> 00:49:36,718
You were never anything
but good to Dad

1113
00:49:37,819 --> 00:49:39,554
and because of that we...

1114
00:49:40,222 --> 00:49:41,790
You can count on us.

1115
00:49:42,624 --> 00:49:44,093
- Hmm?
- Yeah.

1116
00:49:46,262 --> 00:49:48,795
I thought you should've been
at the funeral,

1117
00:49:48,797 --> 00:49:50,765
by the way, I was outvoted.

1118
00:50:01,743 --> 00:50:02,744
Detective.

1119
00:50:04,146 --> 00:50:05,147
You're still here?

1120
00:50:06,781 --> 00:50:07,882
Mmm.

1121
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:13,653
Did you know Harlan?

1122
00:50:13,655 --> 00:50:14,921
He knew my father,

1123
00:50:14,923 --> 00:50:16,991
who was a police detective
years ago.

1124
00:50:18,026 --> 00:50:19,126
Oh.

1125
00:50:19,128 --> 00:50:21,062
My father
respected Harlan.

1126
00:50:21,796 --> 00:50:23,729
That says quite a lot.

1127
00:50:23,731 --> 00:50:25,066
Is that why
you're here?

1128
00:50:26,402 --> 00:50:28,202
Here now, here?

1129
00:50:28,204 --> 00:50:30,304
No.

1130
00:50:30,306 --> 00:50:32,640
I stayed hoping to speak
to you a little more.

1131
00:50:38,012 --> 00:50:41,015
Something is afoot
with this whole affair.

1132
00:50:42,351 --> 00:50:44,016
I know it.

1133
00:50:44,018 --> 00:50:46,054
I believe you know it, too.

1134
00:50:47,856 --> 00:50:49,191
So you're gonna keep digging?

1135
00:50:50,459 --> 00:50:53,893
Harlan's detectives,
they dig.

1136
00:50:53,895 --> 00:50:56,096
They riffle and root.

1137
00:50:56,098 --> 00:50:57,333
Truffle pigs.

1138
00:50:59,135 --> 00:51:03,105
I anticipate the terminus
of <i>Gravity's Rainbow.</i>

1139
00:51:03,938 --> 00:51:05,107
<i>Gravity's Rainbow?</i>

1140
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:07,039
It's a novel.

1141
00:51:07,041 --> 00:51:08,875
Yeah, I know.

1142
00:51:08,877 --> 00:51:11,245
- I haven't read it though.
- Neither have I.

1143
00:51:11,247 --> 00:51:12,312
Nobody has.

1144
00:51:12,314 --> 00:51:13,781
But I like the title.

1145
00:51:14,782 --> 00:51:16,916
It describes
the path of a projectile

1146
00:51:16,918 --> 00:51:19,319
determined by natural law.

1147
00:51:19,321 --> 00:51:21,854
<i>Et voila,</i> my method.

1148
00:51:21,856 --> 00:51:23,190
I observe the facts

1149
00:51:23,192 --> 00:51:26,025
without biases
of the head or heart.

1150
00:51:26,027 --> 00:51:28,027
I determine the arc's path,

1151
00:51:28,029 --> 00:51:30,763
stroll leisurely
to its terminus

1152
00:51:30,765 --> 00:51:33,302
and the truth
falls at my feet.

1153
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:39,173
The medical examiner was ready
to rule this a suicide,

1154
00:51:39,175 --> 00:51:42,211
but Elliott agreed to keep it
pending for 48 hours.

1155
00:51:42,877 --> 00:51:43,943
Tomorrow morning,

1156
00:51:43,945 --> 00:51:45,778
I search the grounds
and the house,

1157
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:46,915
begin my investigation.

1158
00:51:47,982 --> 00:51:50,150
I want you to be
by my side for it.

1159
00:51:50,152 --> 00:51:51,751
- What?
- My confidante.

1160
00:51:51,753 --> 00:51:52,852
My eyes and ears.

1161
00:51:52,854 --> 00:51:54,787
Hey. Wait, wait,
Detective. Why me?

1162
00:51:54,789 --> 00:51:57,259
I trust your kind heart.

1163
00:51:59,161 --> 00:52:00,160
Also, you're the only one

1164
00:52:00,162 --> 00:52:02,264
who had nothing to gain
from Harlan's death.

1165
00:52:03,532 --> 00:52:04,999
So how about it, Watson?

1166
00:52:05,934 --> 00:52:07,234
Hey, Detective?

1167
00:52:07,236 --> 00:52:09,438
If you want my insight
into the family...

1168
00:52:10,838 --> 00:52:12,274
None of them are murderers.

1169
00:52:12,974 --> 00:52:14,208
That's my insight.

1170
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:15,442
And yet,

1171
00:52:15,444 --> 00:52:18,512
be it cruel or comforting,

1172
00:52:18,514 --> 00:52:22,151
this machine unerringly
arrives at the truth.

1173
00:52:23,085 --> 00:52:24,786
That's what it does.

1174
00:52:26,054 --> 00:52:27,256
Always?

1175
00:52:28,257 --> 00:52:29,491
Tomorrow at 8:00.

1176
00:53:00,155 --> 00:53:02,054
<i>I know
I've missed something.</i>

1177
00:53:02,056 --> 00:53:03,223
<i>There's gonna be something
I missed.</i>

1178
00:53:03,225 --> 00:53:05,259
<i>- Harlan.
- But I know you can do this.</i>

1179
00:53:05,261 --> 00:53:06,326
<i>No, I can't.</i>

1180
00:53:06,328 --> 00:53:07,893
Without losing your soul,

1181
00:53:07,895 --> 00:53:09,162
you have to do
what you have to do...

1182
00:53:09,164 --> 00:53:10,564
- No.
- To beat this and win.

1183
00:53:10,566 --> 00:53:11,998
Harlan, I can't.

1184
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,002
- You can. And you have to.
- No.

1185
00:53:15,003 --> 00:53:16,037
For me.

1186
00:53:17,139 --> 00:53:18,773
Right now!

1187
00:53:37,559 --> 00:53:39,495
Harlan, I have to
get you help.

1188
00:53:40,928 --> 00:53:42,331
You do as I say

1189
00:53:43,499 --> 00:53:45,933
and everything
will be just fine.

1190
00:53:46,268 --> 00:53:48,168
No. No.

1191
00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:49,305
I promise.

1192
00:53:50,306 --> 00:53:51,371
But...

1193
00:55:00,509 --> 00:55:03,477
Fifty years ago,
I worked this estate.

1194
00:55:03,479 --> 00:55:06,446
You know, security back then
was such that

1195
00:55:06,448 --> 00:55:10,083
you had to make
the rounds with a 94

1196
00:55:10,085 --> 00:55:13,018
and keep your ears open.

1197
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:17,424
Now you've got
all this modern technology.

1198
00:55:17,426 --> 00:55:19,659
Now, that's
the video there.

1199
00:55:19,661 --> 00:55:22,462
I saved the tape
from that night.

1200
00:55:22,464 --> 00:55:26,099
Normally, I erase 'em
with a magnetic degausser,

1201
00:55:26,101 --> 00:55:29,236
but in this case, I thought
I'd just save it, you know?

1202
00:55:29,238 --> 00:55:31,003
For security.

1203
00:55:31,005 --> 00:55:33,475
Now, uh,
that's a live feed there.

1204
00:55:35,277 --> 00:55:37,177
<i>To avoid
the security cameras,</i>

1205
00:55:37,179 --> 00:55:39,979
<i>pull off the road
after the carved elephant.</i>

1206
00:55:39,981 --> 00:55:42,115
All right, well,
can we see the actual tape?

1207
00:55:42,117 --> 00:55:44,049
Well, of course you can.

1208
00:55:44,051 --> 00:55:46,286
I recorded it SSLP.

1209
00:55:46,288 --> 00:55:48,188
There's eight hours
in that tape.

1210
00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:50,325
9:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m.

1211
00:56:00,001 --> 00:56:02,067
Looks like
a Japanese horror movie.

1212
00:56:02,069 --> 00:56:04,371
You think we could
scan forward on that?

1213
00:56:04,373 --> 00:56:05,739
Are we all gonna die
in seven days?

1214
00:56:05,741 --> 00:56:07,140
How can we scan forward?

1215
00:56:07,142 --> 00:56:09,643
Oh, yeah, just hold
the play button down

1216
00:56:09,645 --> 00:56:13,047
and press FF
until you hear it grind.

1217
00:56:19,521 --> 00:56:21,121
All right.
Should be coming up now

1218
00:56:21,123 --> 00:56:22,558
to the time
when the party ended.

1219
00:56:25,727 --> 00:56:27,461
What happened?

1220
00:56:27,463 --> 00:56:30,062
You gotta keep holding it down
or else it'll eject.

1221
00:56:30,064 --> 00:56:32,199
That thing eats tapes
like popcorn.

1222
00:56:32,201 --> 00:56:34,301
You think your guys
can digitize this

1223
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:35,735
so we could scan it properly?

1224
00:56:35,737 --> 00:56:37,105
Yeah,
I think we can do that.

1225
00:56:38,173 --> 00:56:39,274
I got it.

1226
00:56:41,143 --> 00:56:42,742
You know,
all these statues

1227
00:56:42,744 --> 00:56:43,810
that you see around here?

1228
00:56:43,812 --> 00:56:45,345
They're all straight out
of the series,

1229
00:56:45,347 --> 00:56:47,280
<i>The Menagerie Tragedy Trilogy.</i>

1230
00:56:47,282 --> 00:56:49,282
- Pretty cool.
- Awesome.

1231
00:56:49,284 --> 00:56:50,684
Yeah.

1232
00:56:50,686 --> 00:56:53,119
Benny,
it's beautiful out here,

1233
00:56:53,121 --> 00:56:55,054
but do you really think
someone broke into the house

1234
00:56:55,056 --> 00:56:56,723
and murdered Harlan?
Is that why we're out here?

1235
00:56:56,725 --> 00:56:58,592
Oh, it is unlikely,

1236
00:56:58,594 --> 00:57:01,294
but if they did,
there will be traces.

1237
00:57:01,296 --> 00:57:03,465
- Uh, I can hang on to that.
- Yeah.

1238
00:57:11,707 --> 00:57:14,307
Hey, Wagner,
you got any luck on...

1239
00:57:15,377 --> 00:57:17,310
- Uh, what's-his-name?
- Ransom?

1240
00:57:17,312 --> 00:57:19,181
- Yeah.
- No.

1241
00:57:20,449 --> 00:57:21,848
Did get an
address though.

1242
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:24,720
- Yeah?
- 10 Kenoak Street.

1243
00:57:25,654 --> 00:57:27,621
Ken... Kenoak?

1244
00:57:27,623 --> 00:57:29,191
Uh-huh.
- Kenoak.

1245
00:57:30,492 --> 00:57:32,461
It's a pleasant thing
to say, isn't it?

1246
00:57:32,828 --> 00:57:34,327
Kenoak.

1247
00:57:34,329 --> 00:57:36,796
I awoke amid Kenoak.

1248
00:57:36,798 --> 00:57:38,632
That's funny. Ken-oh-kia.

1249
00:57:38,634 --> 00:57:40,333
All these leaves and mud,

1250
00:57:40,335 --> 00:57:42,836
they're really gonna do
a number on my boots, man.

1251
00:57:42,838 --> 00:57:46,172
Mud. Did it rain
the past week?

1252
00:57:46,174 --> 00:57:47,607
- No, stay there!
- What?

1253
00:57:47,609 --> 00:57:48,742
Whoa!

1254
00:57:48,744 --> 00:57:49,876
Okay.

1255
00:57:49,878 --> 00:57:51,811
We got footprints here,
so, uh...

1256
00:57:51,813 --> 00:57:53,282
- Oh.
- I wanna, um...

1257
00:57:53,749 --> 00:57:55,382
Marta...

1258
00:57:55,384 --> 00:57:56,716
- Stop.
- What?

1259
00:57:56,718 --> 00:57:57,884
- Um...
- What?

1260
00:57:57,886 --> 00:57:59,352
Marta, stay there.

1261
00:57:59,354 --> 00:58:01,521
- What?
- No, Marta! Stay there, Marta.

1262
00:58:01,523 --> 00:58:02,889
- No! No!
- I couldn't hear. If you...

1263
00:58:02,891 --> 00:58:04,157
- Did you call me?
- All right.

1264
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:05,225
- All right.
- Excuse me.

1265
00:58:05,227 --> 00:58:06,192
- All right.
- Come here.

1266
00:58:06,194 --> 00:58:07,727
Wagner, we're gonna
need to call the boys,

1267
00:58:07,729 --> 00:58:08,795
have 'em come down here,

1268
00:58:08,797 --> 00:58:09,663
take a look
at all these tracks.

1269
00:58:09,665 --> 00:58:11,498
Get it taped off.
Stay on that side.

1270
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:12,699
- I'm sorry.
- Watch out. Watch out.

1271
00:58:12,701 --> 00:58:14,269
Okay.

1272
00:58:14,903 --> 00:58:16,371
Hey! Yeah!

1273
00:58:17,272 --> 00:58:18,738
Hussie? Hussie, hey.

1274
00:58:20,208 --> 00:58:22,842
Best judge of character
is a dog.

1275
00:58:22,844 --> 00:58:24,811
- Good boy.
- I've found that to be true.

1276
00:58:29,618 --> 00:58:30,619
Yes!

1277
00:58:31,219 --> 00:58:32,819
My puppies!

1278
00:58:32,821 --> 00:58:33,887
- Yes.
- Yeah, well,

1279
00:58:33,889 --> 00:58:37,324
they've got plans to read
the will at around 10:00,

1280
00:58:37,326 --> 00:58:39,194
so, the whole family
will be here soon.

1281
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:43,296
I've never been
to a will reading.

1282
00:58:43,298 --> 00:58:44,698
Oh, well...

1283
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:47,467
You think it'd be
like a game show,

1284
00:58:47,469 --> 00:58:49,636
but think of a community
theater production

1285
00:58:49,638 --> 00:58:51,340
of a tax return.

1286
00:58:52,874 --> 00:58:54,808
So, what are we
looking for?

1287
00:58:54,810 --> 00:58:55,809
Oh, you know,

1288
00:58:55,811 --> 00:58:59,279
anything suspicious
or out of the ordinary.

1289
00:58:59,281 --> 00:59:01,414
You'll know it
when you see it.

1290
00:59:01,416 --> 00:59:02,684
Oh, my God.

1291
00:59:04,186 --> 00:59:05,554
Sweet beans!

1292
00:59:09,625 --> 00:59:10,759
Well...

1293
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:13,362
Good morning, Mrs. Thrombey.

1294
00:59:22,371 --> 00:59:24,239
You think you could
handle the study?

1295
00:59:34,216 --> 00:59:36,549
Where's your medical bag?

1296
00:59:36,551 --> 00:59:38,718
I don't know.
I left it here.

1297
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,420
I always leave it here
with Harlan at night.

1298
00:59:40,422 --> 00:59:41,855
They must have taken
it in as evidence.

1299
00:59:41,857 --> 00:59:43,456
I'll look
into that.

1300
00:59:43,458 --> 00:59:44,591
Mmm.

1301
00:59:48,930 --> 00:59:50,365
Shit.

1302
00:59:52,801 --> 00:59:55,602
How'd the Go board
get knocked over?

1303
00:59:55,604 --> 00:59:57,305
We were just
goofing around.

1304
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:00,242
What are you thinking?

1305
01:00:15,424 --> 01:00:17,225
No! No, no, no!
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1306
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:19,659
Oh, let me guess.

1307
01:00:19,661 --> 01:00:21,730
Hey! Stop. Stop.

1308
01:00:22,497 --> 01:00:23,532
Stop. Stop.

1309
01:00:24,633 --> 01:00:26,833
Hugh Drysdale?

1310
01:00:26,835 --> 01:00:29,736
Ransom. Call me Ransom,
it's my middle name.

1311
01:00:29,738 --> 01:00:31,339
Only the help
calls me Hugh.

1312
01:00:32,307 --> 01:00:33,373
Okay.

1313
01:00:33,375 --> 01:00:34,941
Uh, this is
Trooper Wagner.

1314
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:36,976
I'm Lieutenant Elliott.

1315
01:00:36,978 --> 01:00:38,680
We just wanna ask
a few questions.

1316
01:00:42,784 --> 01:00:43,785
Excuse me?

1317
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:46,352
Sir?

1318
01:00:46,354 --> 01:00:47,821
We're officers
of the law!

1319
01:00:47,823 --> 01:00:49,889
You gonna run me in?
I don't feel like talking.

1320
01:00:49,891 --> 01:00:51,524
I'm distraught.

1321
01:00:51,526 --> 01:00:53,860
Hey, Benny, you wanna ask
this guy some questions?

1322
01:00:53,862 --> 01:00:55,361
All right, what is this?
What's this arrangement?

1323
01:00:55,363 --> 01:00:56,431
Mr. Drysdale.

1324
01:00:57,432 --> 01:00:59,267
CSI KFC?

1325
01:01:04,306 --> 01:01:05,705
Hey, Frannie,

1326
01:01:05,707 --> 01:01:07,373
how about a glass
of cold milk?

1327
01:01:07,375 --> 01:01:08,742
Hey, asshole.

1328
01:01:08,744 --> 01:01:10,443
Not her name,
not her job.

1329
01:01:10,445 --> 01:01:13,780
Hey, Meg.
How's the SJW degree coming?

1330
01:01:13,782 --> 01:01:16,585
- Trust fund prick.
- All right, guys.

1331
01:01:16,918 --> 01:01:18,351
Hey.

1332
01:01:18,353 --> 01:01:20,553
Hey. Everyone...

1333
01:01:20,555 --> 01:01:22,822
I'm just gonna be
in the other room, setting up.

1334
01:01:22,824 --> 01:01:24,326
Be ready in 10 minutes.

1335
01:01:30,398 --> 01:01:32,332
Funny, Ransom,
you skipped the funeral,

1336
01:01:32,334 --> 01:01:33,969
but you're early
for the will reading.

1337
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:38,037
Okay, people grieve
in different ways.

1338
01:01:38,039 --> 01:01:39,038
Let's not...

1339
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:40,740
You know what?
It's funny you're here at all.

1340
01:01:40,742 --> 01:01:42,041
Why are you even bothering?

1341
01:01:42,043 --> 01:01:43,676
That's what
I'm asking myself.

1342
01:01:43,678 --> 01:01:45,345
What's that supposed to mean?

1343
01:01:45,347 --> 01:01:47,447
He knows what it's
supposed to mean.

1344
01:01:47,449 --> 01:01:48,850
Wait... Walt, what?

1345
01:01:50,685 --> 01:01:53,822
Jacob was in that bathroom
the night of the party.

1346
01:01:55,557 --> 01:01:57,557
Oh,
that's where you were all night?

1347
01:01:57,559 --> 01:01:58,858
What the hell
were you doing

1348
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:00,127
in the bathroom all night?

1349
01:02:00,129 --> 01:02:01,995
- Nothing.
- Swatting Syrian refugees?

1350
01:02:01,997 --> 01:02:03,062
No, I was not.

1351
01:02:03,064 --> 01:02:04,364
Alt-right troll.

1352
01:02:04,366 --> 01:02:05,431
Liberal snowflake.

1353
01:02:05,433 --> 01:02:07,101
I don't know what
any of that means.

1354
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:08,868
It means your son's
a little creep.

1355
01:02:08,870 --> 01:02:09,936
Oh!

1356
01:02:09,938 --> 01:02:11,538
My son's a creep?

1357
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:12,839
Guys, just...

1358
01:02:12,841 --> 01:02:14,440
Walt, he was
in the bathroom.

1359
01:02:14,442 --> 01:02:15,875
Yeah, he was
in the bathroom.

1360
01:02:15,877 --> 01:02:18,680
Joylessly masturbating
to pictures of dead deer.

1361
01:02:19,748 --> 01:02:21,481
You know what, Richard?

1362
01:02:21,483 --> 01:02:22,549
You wanna go?

1363
01:02:22,551 --> 01:02:24,151
You bet, skippy, let's go.

1364
01:02:24,153 --> 01:02:25,585
You wanna go?
Come on!

1365
01:02:25,587 --> 01:02:26,953
You better
watch out, man.

1366
01:02:26,955 --> 01:02:28,555
- Walt, stop it right now!
- Son of a bitch!

1367
01:02:28,557 --> 01:02:29,622
- Stop it! Just stop!
- Stop it!

1368
01:02:29,624 --> 01:02:30,657
Let go!
Let go, Richard!

1369
01:02:30,659 --> 01:02:32,525
I have been waiting
for this my whole life!

1370
01:02:32,527 --> 01:02:34,727
- Stop it, right now!
- Donna, I can handle myself!

1371
01:02:34,729 --> 01:02:36,062
- Stop it!
- I can handle it.

1372
01:02:36,064 --> 01:02:37,463
Oh, my God.

1373
01:02:37,465 --> 01:02:39,766
We gotta do this more often.

1374
01:02:39,768 --> 01:02:40,769
Hey!

1375
01:02:41,503 --> 01:02:42,569
Jacob.

1376
01:02:42,571 --> 01:02:44,437
We know
where this is going.

1377
01:02:44,439 --> 01:02:46,539
You were in the bathroom
next to Harlan's office,

1378
01:02:46,541 --> 01:02:48,108
where he had the fight
with Ransom.

1379
01:02:48,110 --> 01:02:49,742
Now, you heard something.

1380
01:02:49,744 --> 01:02:50,879
Spill it.

1381
01:02:52,914 --> 01:02:54,848
I just heard two things.

1382
01:02:58,187 --> 01:02:59,387
...my will.

1383
01:02:59,721 --> 01:03:00,755
"My will."

1384
01:03:01,623 --> 01:03:04,025
And then there was more yelling.

1385
01:03:05,060 --> 01:03:07,062
And then I heard Ransom say...

1386
01:03:08,130 --> 01:03:09,531
"I'm warning you."

1387
01:03:13,568 --> 01:03:15,102
Ransom...

1388
01:03:15,104 --> 01:03:17,003
What's that mean?

1389
01:03:17,005 --> 01:03:19,505
I think it means our father
finally came to his senses

1390
01:03:19,507 --> 01:03:22,876
and cut this worthless
little brat out of his will.

1391
01:03:22,878 --> 01:03:25,478
So I guess you're gonna have
to sell the Beemer

1392
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:27,480
and give your notice
at the country club,

1393
01:03:27,482 --> 01:03:29,782
and kick whatever
fashion drug you're on.

1394
01:03:29,784 --> 01:03:31,017
Because if you think

1395
01:03:31,019 --> 01:03:33,019
that after all the bridges
you've burned,

1396
01:03:33,021 --> 01:03:34,053
after all the
shit you said,

1397
01:03:34,055 --> 01:03:36,823
after everything that
you put this family through

1398
01:03:36,825 --> 01:03:38,057
for the last 10 years,

1399
01:03:38,059 --> 01:03:40,493
that any of us
are gonna support you

1400
01:03:40,495 --> 01:03:42,595
that any of us
are gonna give you,

1401
01:03:42,597 --> 01:03:44,564
like Dad liked to say,

1402
01:03:44,566 --> 01:03:46,866
"a single red dime..."

1403
01:03:46,868 --> 01:03:48,168
you're nuts!

1404
01:03:49,738 --> 01:03:50,839
Wow.

1405
01:03:52,641 --> 01:03:53,742
Son...

1406
01:03:54,776 --> 01:03:56,243
Father.

1407
01:03:56,245 --> 01:03:58,245
Did Harlan tell you

1408
01:03:58,247 --> 01:04:00,048
he was gonna cut you
out of the will?

1409
01:04:01,917 --> 01:04:02,951
Yep.

1410
01:04:06,122 --> 01:04:08,222
Well, then he's done

1411
01:04:08,224 --> 01:04:10,558
what none of us were
strong enough to do.

1412
01:04:12,128 --> 01:04:15,131
Maybe this might finally
make you grow up.

1413
01:04:17,133 --> 01:04:18,998
This might be the best thing

1414
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,733
that could
ever happen to you.

1415
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:23,203
Thank you. My mother,
ladies and gentlemen.

1416
01:04:23,205 --> 01:04:25,905
Look, this is not
gonna be easy for you,

1417
01:04:25,907 --> 01:04:27,507
but it'll be good.

1418
01:04:27,509 --> 01:04:29,178
Nothing good is ever easy.

1419
01:04:29,911 --> 01:04:31,111
Up your ass, Joni.

1420
01:04:31,113 --> 01:04:33,280
You've had your teeth in this
family's tit for a long time.

1421
01:04:33,282 --> 01:04:35,581
"Up your ass"?
Oh, very nice.

1422
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:37,684
- Matter of fact, eat shit.
- Oh, my God, Ransom.

1423
01:04:37,686 --> 01:04:38,751
- What?
- How's that?

1424
01:04:38,753 --> 01:04:40,053
Please do not
use that word

1425
01:04:40,055 --> 01:04:41,554
- in front of my son.
- In fact, eat shit. Eat shit.

1426
01:04:41,556 --> 01:04:42,722
If I wasn't practicing...

1427
01:04:42,724 --> 01:04:43,690
- Eat shit.
- You entitled prick!

1428
01:04:43,692 --> 01:04:45,292
I would slap that
smug smile right off...

1429
01:04:45,294 --> 01:04:47,760
- Definitely eat shit.
- ...of your goddamn face!

1430
01:04:47,762 --> 01:04:49,196
Eat shit.
You can all eat shit.

1431
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:53,802
I'm not eating
one iota of shit!

1432
01:04:55,537 --> 01:04:58,805
What was that about
will readings being boring?

1433
01:04:58,807 --> 01:05:00,907
The exception
that proves the rule.

1434
01:05:02,877 --> 01:05:04,579
Asshole.

1435
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:07,981
"I'm warning you."

1436
01:05:07,983 --> 01:05:10,184
Ransom said,
"I'm warning you."

1437
01:05:10,186 --> 01:05:11,851
Well, you heard
Ransom in there.

1438
01:05:11,853 --> 01:05:14,020
That's the kind of
thing he says.

1439
01:05:14,022 --> 01:05:15,690
You want this?
You want this?

1440
01:05:20,262 --> 01:05:22,098
What do we have here?

1441
01:05:27,969 --> 01:05:31,671
This looks like
a relatively fresh break.

1442
01:05:31,673 --> 01:05:33,074
Yep. Right there.

1443
01:05:34,176 --> 01:05:35,641
Wait a minute.

1444
01:05:35,643 --> 01:05:37,746
Well, that doesn't make sense.

1445
01:05:38,314 --> 01:05:40,314
Where's that window?

1446
01:05:40,316 --> 01:05:42,715
How about some
more cookies, Hugh?

1447
01:05:42,717 --> 01:05:44,619
- You want some more cookies?
- That's great. That's great.

1448
01:05:45,653 --> 01:05:47,121
Hey, maybe Harlan left you

1449
01:05:47,123 --> 01:05:50,025
a cold glass of milk
in his will. Asshole.

1450
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:54,029
Show me.
But stay off the carpet.

1451
01:06:08,943 --> 01:06:10,843
It's the trick window

1452
01:06:10,845 --> 01:06:13,046
from <i>A Kill For All Seasons.</i>

1453
01:06:13,048 --> 01:06:14,749
Trooper, here, will you?
Take this.

1454
01:06:24,926 --> 01:06:26,793
Hmm.

1455
01:06:26,795 --> 01:06:30,029
Traces of dried mud.

1456
01:06:30,031 --> 01:06:33,001
I suspect they go
the length of the hallway.

1457
01:06:34,035 --> 01:06:35,135
Footprints?

1458
01:06:35,137 --> 01:06:37,036
No, just traces.

1459
01:06:37,038 --> 01:06:39,906
Yeah, depending on when
this thing was last cleaned,

1460
01:06:39,908 --> 01:06:43,143
this could have happened
at any time, right?

1461
01:06:43,145 --> 01:06:45,181
No, that would
not explain this.

1462
01:06:46,881 --> 01:06:48,182
Analyze that mud.

1463
01:06:48,184 --> 01:06:49,882
It will match
these traces.

1464
01:06:49,884 --> 01:06:50,850
Take this to Jamie.

1465
01:06:50,852 --> 01:06:51,951
And you will find
similar samples

1466
01:06:51,953 --> 01:06:54,823
leading up the trellis
on the outside of the house.

1467
01:06:55,690 --> 01:06:56,923
On the night of the party,

1468
01:06:56,925 --> 01:06:59,926
somebody who did not want to
be heard climbing those steps,

1469
01:06:59,928 --> 01:07:01,661
went to a great deal of trouble

1470
01:07:01,663 --> 01:07:03,365
to break into
Harlan Thrombey's rooms.

1471
01:07:04,732 --> 01:07:07,203
The game is afoot,
eh, Watson?

1472
01:07:18,046 --> 01:07:21,181
Well, thank you all for
getting together like this.

1473
01:07:21,183 --> 01:07:23,417
It isn't legally necessary,

1474
01:07:23,419 --> 01:07:24,917
but I thought because
you're all in town,

1475
01:07:24,919 --> 01:07:26,719
and some of you
are leaving soon...

1476
01:07:26,721 --> 01:07:27,787
Excuse me.

1477
01:07:27,789 --> 01:07:30,090
Uh, I'm sorry.

1478
01:07:30,092 --> 01:07:33,160
Ladies and gentlemen,
I would like to gently request

1479
01:07:33,162 --> 01:07:34,694
that you all stay in town

1480
01:07:34,696 --> 01:07:37,131
until the investigation
is completed.

1481
01:07:37,133 --> 01:07:39,031
Yeah, well,
he's gently requesting,

1482
01:07:39,033 --> 01:07:40,766
but I'm gonna have
to make that an order.

1483
01:07:40,768 --> 01:07:42,469
No one move until we
figure this all out.

1484
01:07:42,471 --> 01:07:43,736
What?

1485
01:07:43,738 --> 01:07:44,937
Can we ask why?

1486
01:07:44,939 --> 01:07:46,406
- Has something changed?
- No.

1487
01:07:46,408 --> 01:07:48,475
No, it hasn't changed?
Or no, we can't ask?

1488
01:07:48,477 --> 01:07:50,210
Mr. Stevens...

1489
01:07:50,212 --> 01:07:51,944
You may continue.

1490
01:07:51,946 --> 01:07:53,215
Right. Well...

1491
01:07:54,015 --> 01:07:55,282
The other reason I thought

1492
01:07:55,284 --> 01:07:57,717
this gathering
would be, uh, beneficial

1493
01:07:57,719 --> 01:08:01,255
is because
Harlan altered his will

1494
01:08:01,257 --> 01:08:02,889
a week before he died.

1495
01:08:02,891 --> 01:08:04,258
He sealed it.

1496
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:06,859
He asked me not to
submit it to the courts

1497
01:08:06,861 --> 01:08:08,295
for probate
until after his death.

1498
01:08:08,297 --> 01:08:11,231
So, if anyone is confused
about anything,

1499
01:08:11,233 --> 01:08:13,799
we're all together,
we can talk.

1500
01:08:13,801 --> 01:08:15,968
Although I don't imagine
any of it

1501
01:08:15,970 --> 01:08:17,870
is going to be
that complicated.

1502
01:08:17,872 --> 01:08:19,939
Uh, Harlan's
assets included...

1503
01:08:19,941 --> 01:08:21,007
Um...

1504
01:08:21,009 --> 01:08:22,376
- The house.
- The house,

1505
01:08:22,378 --> 01:08:24,043
which he owned outright.

1506
01:08:24,045 --> 01:08:25,112
Um...

1507
01:08:25,114 --> 01:08:26,313
$60 million.

1508
01:08:26,315 --> 01:08:29,116
Yes. $60 million
in various cash accounts

1509
01:08:29,118 --> 01:08:30,484
and investments.

1510
01:08:30,486 --> 01:08:32,087
And of course,

1511
01:08:32,854 --> 01:08:34,121
the real asset,

1512
01:08:34,123 --> 01:08:36,789
sole ownership
of Blood Like Wine,

1513
01:08:36,791 --> 01:08:37,957
his publishing company.

1514
01:08:37,959 --> 01:08:41,528
He also wrote up a statement
when he was making the changes

1515
01:08:41,530 --> 01:08:43,232
and he wanted
that read first.

1516
01:08:46,168 --> 01:08:49,068
"Dearest Linda,
Walter, and Joni...

1517
01:08:49,070 --> 01:08:51,971
"Some of you may be surprised
by the choice I've made here.

1518
01:08:51,973 --> 01:08:54,274
"No pleasure was taken
in the exclusion.

1519
01:08:54,276 --> 01:08:56,076
"And its purpose
was not to sow

1520
01:08:56,078 --> 01:08:57,777
"greater discord in the family,

1521
01:08:57,779 --> 01:08:59,446
"quite the opposite.

1522
01:08:59,448 --> 01:09:02,082
"Please accept it with grace
and without bitterness,

1523
01:09:02,084 --> 01:09:03,483
"but do accept it,

1524
01:09:03,485 --> 01:09:05,421
"it's for the best. Dad."

1525
01:09:18,167 --> 01:09:19,099
Um...

1526
01:09:19,101 --> 01:09:22,835
Wow. Well, yeah,
not too complex at all.

1527
01:09:22,837 --> 01:09:23,903
This will be quick.

1528
01:09:25,274 --> 01:09:28,475
"I, Harlan Thrombey,
being of sound mind and body"

1529
01:09:28,477 --> 01:09:31,511
and yada-yada-yada...

1530
01:09:31,513 --> 01:09:34,181
"I hereby direct
that all my assets,

1531
01:09:34,183 --> 01:09:35,915
"both liquid and otherwise...

1532
01:09:35,917 --> 01:09:39,388
"I leave in their entirety

1533
01:09:41,156 --> 01:09:44,124
"My entire ownership

1534
01:09:44,126 --> 01:09:46,993

1535
01:09:46,995 --> 01:09:49,061

1536
01:09:49,063 --> 01:09:51,899
"I leave in its entirety
to Marta Cabrera."

1537
01:09:56,138 --> 01:09:57,139
What?

1538
01:10:00,175 --> 01:10:01,408
Uh...

1539
01:10:01,410 --> 01:10:02,977
- What?
- No.

1540
01:10:04,012 --> 01:10:06,213
- That's not... That's... No.
- No.

1541
01:10:06,215 --> 01:10:07,281
- That can't be.
- No.

1542
01:10:07,283 --> 01:10:08,382
Can I see that
please, Alan?

1543
01:10:08,384 --> 01:10:09,849
- Yeah. It's right.
- Please.

1544
01:10:09,851 --> 01:10:11,151
This can't be legal.

1545
01:10:11,153 --> 01:10:12,586
It's right.

1546
01:10:12,588 --> 01:10:14,288
- You know, he was...
- Oh, my God.

1547
01:10:14,290 --> 01:10:15,455
Aren't there safeguards...

1548
01:10:15,457 --> 01:10:16,856
Alan, there's a mistake.

1549
01:10:16,858 --> 01:10:18,225
I don't know what to say.

1550
01:10:18,227 --> 01:10:19,526
We're his family, so...

1551
01:10:19,528 --> 01:10:20,993
It's not possible.

1552
01:10:20,995 --> 01:10:23,062
Are there safeguards
against this?

1553
01:10:23,064 --> 01:10:25,865
Right mind.
Something...

1554
01:10:25,867 --> 01:10:27,167
- You know...
- Alan, listen...

1555
01:10:27,169 --> 01:10:28,368
- He was on medication.
- In his final days,

1556
01:10:28,370 --> 01:10:30,002
he was on a great deal
of medication.

1557
01:10:30,004 --> 01:10:31,305
Morphine?
All right, morphine.

1558
01:10:31,307 --> 01:10:32,606
- I mean, I don't know.
- This is confusing.

1559
01:10:32,608 --> 01:10:34,441
- She seems like family...
- Alan, you can take...

1560
01:10:34,443 --> 01:10:36,109
- ...but she's not our family.
- ...this piece of paper

1561
01:10:36,111 --> 01:10:39,179
and shove it right up your
ass, and get out!

1562
01:10:39,181 --> 01:10:40,647
And, you cops, too, out.

1563
01:10:40,649 --> 01:10:42,182
- Linda?
- Out! Right now.

1564
01:10:42,184 --> 01:10:44,551
- Hey, Linda?
- No, Richard, we need to talk.

1565
01:10:44,553 --> 01:10:47,287
We need to fight this thing.
We're not going anywhere.

1566
01:10:47,289 --> 01:10:49,423
I said get out!

1567
01:10:49,425 --> 01:10:52,024
We are the Thrombeys,
God damn it!

1568
01:10:52,026 --> 01:10:53,995
This is still our house!

1569
01:10:59,901 --> 01:11:01,234
Hmm?

1570
01:11:01,236 --> 01:11:03,103
Oh, sorry.

1571
01:11:03,105 --> 01:11:05,439
"Likewise the house
at 2 Deerborn Drive

1572
01:11:05,441 --> 01:11:07,074
"and all
belongings therein,

1573
01:11:07,076 --> 01:11:09,543
"I leave to Marta Cabrera."

1574
01:11:10,646 --> 01:11:13,513
Oh, you little bitch!

1575
01:11:13,515 --> 01:11:16,249
- You little bitch!
- Linda?

1576
01:11:16,251 --> 01:11:17,384
Did you know about this?

1577
01:11:17,386 --> 01:11:18,552
Were you in on this
from the beginning?

1578
01:11:18,554 --> 01:11:19,553
- This is unbelievable!
- Easy.

1579
01:11:19,555 --> 01:11:20,620
No, no, no! I just wanna know.
What were you...

1580
01:11:20,622 --> 01:11:23,956
What were you doing?
Were you boinking my father?

1581
01:11:23,958 --> 01:11:25,525
- "Boinking"?
- No, no, no.

1582
01:11:25,527 --> 01:11:27,594
I think everybody just needs
to cool their jets.

1583
01:11:27,596 --> 01:11:30,197
You had sex with my grandpa,
you dirty anchor baby!

1584
01:11:30,199 --> 01:11:31,365
Now hold your horses.

1585
01:11:31,367 --> 01:11:33,133
And in the meantime,
I'd maybe run.

1586
01:11:33,135 --> 01:11:34,568
Wait, wait, wait, Marta?

1587
01:11:34,570 --> 01:11:36,103
Now,
would you please...

1588
01:11:36,105 --> 01:11:37,437
- Ladies and gentlemen, please.
- Marta, talk to us.

1589
01:11:37,439 --> 01:11:39,272
Marta?

1590
01:11:39,274 --> 01:11:40,374
Wait a minute.

1591
01:11:40,376 --> 01:11:42,142
I totally understand how
you must be feeling right now.

1592
01:11:42,144 --> 01:11:43,510
- You cannot leave!
- You can talk to me.

1593
01:11:43,512 --> 01:11:46,146
I don't know what to say.
I don't know.

1594
01:11:46,148 --> 01:11:48,081
- Calm down. Calm down.
- Marta, please...

1595
01:11:48,083 --> 01:11:49,716
Marta, listen, darling...

1596
01:11:49,718 --> 01:11:53,253
I don't know what's happening.
I don't know why he...

1597
01:11:53,255 --> 01:11:56,356
Guys, I'm also confused.
I need to think!

1598
01:11:56,358 --> 01:11:57,659
Marta! Are you listening?

1599
01:11:58,427 --> 01:11:59,992
I can't catch up!

1600
01:12:01,330 --> 01:12:02,662
- I understand. I understand.
- Richard! Open the door!

1601
01:12:02,664 --> 01:12:04,598
Open up that door!

1602
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:06,233
- You are scaring her!
- I can't open the damn door!

1603
01:12:06,235 --> 01:12:08,168
Marta, go. Marta, go.

1604
01:12:08,170 --> 01:12:10,170
Marta,
you have to understand.

1605
01:12:10,172 --> 01:12:11,971
He is our father!

1606
01:12:11,973 --> 01:12:13,373
Marta, listen to me.

1607
01:12:13,375 --> 01:12:15,275
Marta, don't listen
to them. I'm here.

1608
01:12:15,277 --> 01:12:17,077
I'm not on Twitter anymore.

1609
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:20,213
So DM me
on Instagram, okay?

1610
01:12:20,215 --> 01:12:21,483
I wanna talk to you.

1611
01:12:26,555 --> 01:12:28,053
Ransom!

1612
01:12:28,055 --> 01:12:29,489
What the hell's going on?

1613
01:12:29,491 --> 01:12:30,724
I think this could be
the best thing

1614
01:12:30,726 --> 01:12:32,261
to happen to all of you!

1615
01:12:34,363 --> 01:12:35,963
What does he
mean by that?

1616
01:12:37,466 --> 01:12:39,199
Richard, why didn't
you stop her?

1617
01:12:39,201 --> 01:12:40,434
What am I supposed to do?

1618
01:12:40,436 --> 01:12:42,069
Grab the bumper with my teeth?

1619
01:12:52,581 --> 01:12:54,650
Okay, seriously, though,
what the hell?

1620
01:12:59,655 --> 01:13:01,521
Hey.
I'll take an extra bowl.

1621
01:13:01,523 --> 01:13:02,789
Sure.

1622
01:13:09,231 --> 01:13:11,063
You look like
you're gonna pass out.

1623
01:13:11,065 --> 01:13:12,232
Have you eaten
anything today?

1624
01:13:12,234 --> 01:13:13,235
Eat.

1625
01:13:17,439 --> 01:13:18,738
This is a nightmare.

1626
01:13:18,740 --> 01:13:20,375
Mmm-hmm.

1627
01:13:21,443 --> 01:13:22,511
So why?

1628
01:13:24,213 --> 01:13:26,248
- Why?
- Why?

1629
01:13:27,382 --> 01:13:31,485
Hey. This is everything.

1630
01:13:31,487 --> 01:13:33,520
There's gotta be a bigger reason
why, and you know it.

1631
01:13:33,522 --> 01:13:34,588
Well, how about
it had to do more

1632
01:13:34,590 --> 01:13:36,091
with you guys
than with me?

1633
01:13:38,193 --> 01:13:40,227
Yeah.

1634
01:13:40,229 --> 01:13:42,231
Yeah, it's the only thing
that makes sense.

1635
01:13:47,469 --> 01:13:49,102
Did he tell you anything?

1636
01:13:49,104 --> 01:13:50,704
Only that I wasn't
getting a cent.

1637
01:13:50,706 --> 01:13:51,771
That's because
he wanted you

1638
01:13:51,773 --> 01:13:53,507
to build something from
the ground up like your mom.

1639
01:13:53,509 --> 01:13:54,608
"To build something
from the ground up."

1640
01:13:54,610 --> 01:13:56,510
Yeah, my mother built her
business from the ground up

1641
01:13:56,512 --> 01:13:59,179
with a million-dollar loan
from my grandfather.

1642
01:13:59,181 --> 01:14:02,115
My father owns none of it.
She made him sign a prenup.

1643
01:14:02,117 --> 01:14:03,450
He lives in fear.

1644
01:14:03,452 --> 01:14:05,585
And I know that's what
my grandfather was trying

1645
01:14:05,587 --> 01:14:07,120
to protect me from
by doing this

1646
01:14:07,122 --> 01:14:08,655
and I know I shouldn't say
this out loud,

1647
01:14:08,657 --> 01:14:10,158
but when he told me, I...

1648
01:14:12,227 --> 01:14:13,295
Jesus.

1649
01:14:13,762 --> 01:14:15,130
I coulda killed him.

1650
01:14:17,466 --> 01:14:20,600
After I left the party though,
I was driving.

1651
01:14:20,602 --> 01:14:23,472
Nowhere, just in the night,
and I had this, um...

1652
01:14:25,841 --> 01:14:27,142
Clarity.

1653
01:14:28,110 --> 01:14:29,276
Like, from here on out,

1654
01:14:29,278 --> 01:14:31,079
I was gonna have to
fend for myself.

1655
01:14:31,613 --> 01:14:32,614
And that felt...

1656
01:14:34,616 --> 01:14:35,617
Good.

1657
01:14:37,286 --> 01:14:38,487
The old bastard.

1658
01:14:41,823 --> 01:14:44,658
Marta, I know
three things.

1659
01:14:44,660 --> 01:14:45,725
One...

1660
01:14:45,727 --> 01:14:47,429
I know he didn't
commit suicide.

1661
01:14:49,798 --> 01:14:52,134
- What makes you think that?
- I don't think it.

1662
01:14:52,434 --> 01:14:53,867
I know it.

1663
01:14:53,869 --> 01:14:55,402
Because I knew my granddad.

1664
01:14:55,404 --> 01:14:57,637
Maybe you and I were
the only two who knew him,

1665
01:14:57,639 --> 01:15:00,108
so you're not gonna bullshit me
on this because, two...

1666
01:15:01,143 --> 01:15:03,443
I know lying makes you puke.

1667
01:15:03,445 --> 01:15:06,713
'Cause of that mafia game
last Fourth of July.

1668
01:15:06,715 --> 01:15:08,584
And three...

1669
01:15:10,218 --> 01:15:11,084
I know you just ate

1670
01:15:11,086 --> 01:15:13,322
a full plate of baked beans
and sausage.

1671
01:15:16,358 --> 01:15:17,359
So...

1672
01:15:19,461 --> 01:15:20,796
Look me in the eye

1673
01:15:22,230 --> 01:15:24,333
and tell me what happened
to my grandfather.

1674
01:15:27,703 --> 01:15:29,471
- You asshole.
- Marta,

1675
01:15:30,505 --> 01:15:32,407
tell me everything.

1676
01:15:36,178 --> 01:15:37,944
Alan, there have got
to be options here.

1677
01:15:37,946 --> 01:15:39,245
No.

1678
01:15:39,247 --> 01:15:40,747
I don't know
how many times

1679
01:15:40,749 --> 01:15:43,817
I can repeat the same
two pieces of information.

1680
01:15:43,819 --> 01:15:47,187
If Harlan was of sound mind
when he made the changes,

1681
01:15:47,189 --> 01:15:48,788
and we all
confirmed that he was...

1682
01:15:48,790 --> 01:15:50,390
Would a sound mind do this?

1683
01:15:50,392 --> 01:15:51,625
How... Sound, how?

1684
01:15:51,627 --> 01:15:53,927
The very action
speaks to unsoundness.

1685
01:15:53,929 --> 01:15:55,397
Not legally. No.

1686
01:15:56,231 --> 01:15:57,697
You not liking what he did

1687
01:15:57,699 --> 01:16:00,233
does not speak
to testamentary capacity.

1688
01:16:00,235 --> 01:16:02,636
What about
undue influence?

1689
01:16:02,638 --> 01:16:05,372
Yeah! Undue influence,
how about that? Huh?

1690
01:16:05,374 --> 01:16:06,606
Did you just google that?

1691
01:16:06,608 --> 01:16:08,908
Look, if Marta was
manipulating Dad somehow

1692
01:16:08,910 --> 01:16:10,644
- and if we found out...
- If somehow, she had gotten...

1693
01:16:10,646 --> 01:16:11,845
- ...that somehow she was...
- ...her hooks into him...

1694
01:16:11,847 --> 01:16:14,714
You need a strong
case for that.

1695
01:16:14,716 --> 01:16:17,517
"Your Honor,
she endeared herself to him

1696
01:16:17,519 --> 01:16:19,753
"through hard work
and good humor."

1697
01:16:19,755 --> 01:16:21,621
That won't cut the salami.

1698
01:16:21,623 --> 01:16:23,325
What about
the slayer rule?

1699
01:16:23,959 --> 01:16:26,226
I did just google that.

1700
01:16:26,228 --> 01:16:28,595
The slayer rule obviously
doesn't apply here.

1701
01:16:28,597 --> 01:16:30,530
Well, what the hell
is the slayer rule?

1702
01:16:30,532 --> 01:16:31,865
Well, it's if
someone is convicted

1703
01:16:31,867 --> 01:16:33,266
of killing the person,

1704
01:16:33,268 --> 01:16:34,668
they don't get
their inheritance.

1705
01:16:34,670 --> 01:16:35,735
Not even convicted.

1706
01:16:35,737 --> 01:16:36,903
Even if they're
held responsible

1707
01:16:36,905 --> 01:16:38,306
for their death
in civil court.

1708
01:16:38,874 --> 01:16:39,875
Like O.J.?

1709
01:16:40,776 --> 01:16:43,009
Yes, like O.J.

1710
01:16:43,011 --> 01:16:46,214
But Harlan committed suicide.

1711
01:16:54,956 --> 01:16:56,790
Detective Blanc?

1712
01:16:56,792 --> 01:16:58,792
You said
the investigation is ongoing.

1713
01:16:58,794 --> 01:17:00,326
You made a point of that.

1714
01:17:00,328 --> 01:17:01,628
Do you suspect foul play?

1715
01:17:01,630 --> 01:17:04,633
Mr. Blanc,
if you please...

1716
01:17:06,301 --> 01:17:08,635
There is much
that remains unclear,

1717
01:17:08,637 --> 01:17:10,403
but yes,

1718
01:17:10,405 --> 01:17:13,506
I suspect foul play.

1719
01:17:13,508 --> 01:17:15,809
Marta?

1720
01:17:15,811 --> 01:17:18,714
I have eliminated
no suspects.

1721
01:17:20,449 --> 01:17:21,848
You're full of shit.

1722
01:17:21,850 --> 01:17:23,917
I don't trust this guy
in the tweed suit.

1723
01:17:23,919 --> 01:17:26,254
And, Alan, God bless you,
you're useless.

1724
01:17:26,855 --> 01:17:27,921
Thank you.

1725
01:17:27,923 --> 01:17:29,622
There's only one
answer to this.

1726
01:17:29,624 --> 01:17:31,057
She has to renounce
the inheritance.

1727
01:17:31,059 --> 01:17:32,692
She knows it's
what she should do.

1728
01:17:32,694 --> 01:17:33,760
- That's exactly what she...
- It's the right thing to do.

1729
01:17:33,762 --> 01:17:34,994
- Right?
- No way...

1730
01:17:34,996 --> 01:17:36,629
It's the moral thing.

1731
01:17:36,631 --> 01:17:38,331
- Mom.
- She'll do it.

1732
01:17:38,333 --> 01:17:39,899
If Granddad wanted to give
Marta everything,

1733
01:17:39,901 --> 01:17:41,034
then that's what he wanted.

1734
01:17:41,036 --> 01:17:42,435
No.

1735
01:17:42,437 --> 01:17:44,671
This wasn't him. He loved us.

1736
01:17:44,673 --> 01:17:46,039
He wanted us taken care of.

1737
01:17:46,041 --> 01:17:48,276
He wanted you
to have an education.

1738
01:17:48,643 --> 01:17:50,077
Meg,

1739
01:17:50,079 --> 01:17:52,579
you think I can pay
for your school?

1740
01:18:02,991 --> 01:18:04,091
I know.

1741
01:18:04,093 --> 01:18:05,525
Just saying it,
it sounds insane,

1742
01:18:05,527 --> 01:18:06,760
but it's all true.

1743
01:18:06,762 --> 01:18:09,562
And I think Blanc's been
on to me from the start.

1744
01:18:09,564 --> 01:18:11,767
I don't care if I go to
jail, but my mom,

1745
01:18:12,501 --> 01:18:13,635
my sister?

1746
01:18:13,969 --> 01:18:14,970
We...

1747
01:18:17,539 --> 01:18:18,807
You gonna say something?

1748
01:18:20,442 --> 01:18:22,076
I always thought
I was the only one

1749
01:18:22,078 --> 01:18:23,478
that could beat him at Go.

1750
01:18:24,613 --> 01:18:26,946
Always thought
that meant something.

1751
01:18:26,948 --> 01:18:28,948
Um, yeah, I know you did.

1752
01:18:28,950 --> 01:18:30,650
That night at the party,

1753
01:18:30,652 --> 01:18:32,685
my last
conversation with him...

1754
01:18:32,687 --> 01:18:33,753
My last argument,

1755
01:18:33,755 --> 01:18:36,523
that's what he
told me about you.

1756
01:18:36,525 --> 01:18:39,494
That you beat him at Go more
than I do, and I thought...

1757
01:18:41,463 --> 01:18:43,498
What a strange
thing to tell me.

1758
01:18:45,700 --> 01:18:46,935
Think I get it now.

1759
01:18:49,538 --> 01:18:51,306
Maybe it did mean something.

1760
01:18:56,845 --> 01:18:58,812
I'm not gonna tell
my family shit.

1761
01:18:58,814 --> 01:19:00,147
You're not gonna go to jail.

1762
01:19:00,149 --> 01:19:02,982
That detective is not
gonna catch you.

1763
01:19:02,984 --> 01:19:04,486
And you're not gonna
give up the money.

1764
01:19:05,554 --> 01:19:06,953
This is what Granddad
wanted for you.

1765
01:19:06,955 --> 01:19:08,788
I mean, think about what he
did to go through with this.

1766
01:19:08,790 --> 01:19:12,126
He wanted this for himself,
he wanted this for the family.

1767
01:19:12,128 --> 01:19:13,927
And he wanted it for you.

1768
01:19:13,929 --> 01:19:15,397
You've come this far.

1769
01:19:16,165 --> 01:19:18,464
Let me help you
go all the way.

1770
01:19:18,466 --> 01:19:20,066
What's going on?
This isn't you.

1771
01:19:20,068 --> 01:19:21,935
You could just
turn me in right now

1772
01:19:21,937 --> 01:19:23,870
and still get your cut
of the inheritance.

1773
01:19:23,872 --> 01:19:25,572
Why?

1774
01:19:25,574 --> 01:19:27,042
Because fuck my family.

1775
01:19:28,810 --> 01:19:30,743
I can help you
get away with this.

1776
01:19:30,745 --> 01:19:32,712
And then,

1777
01:19:32,714 --> 01:19:34,783
you're gonna give me
my cut of the inheritance.

1778
01:19:36,651 --> 01:19:39,652
Happy ending. Everybody wins.
You, me...

1779
01:19:39,654 --> 01:19:40,753
Harlan.

1780
01:19:40,755 --> 01:19:41,756
Yeah.

1781
01:19:43,092 --> 01:19:44,392
Deal?

1782
01:19:56,538 --> 01:19:57,637
Meg.

1783
01:19:57,639 --> 01:19:58,640
<i>Marta...</i>

1784
01:19:59,474 --> 01:20:01,007
<i>That was nuts.</i>

1785
01:20:01,009 --> 01:20:02,142
I know.

1786
01:20:02,144 --> 01:20:03,511
<i>Are you okay?</i>

1787
01:20:04,946 --> 01:20:07,081
Yeah. Are you?

1788
01:20:07,083 --> 01:20:08,650
<i>Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine, I...</i>

1789
01:20:10,086 --> 01:20:12,518
<i>Look, no one knows
I'm calling you, I just...</i>

1790
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:13,622
<i>I wanted to...</i>

1791
01:20:16,192 --> 01:20:19,095
<i>I wanted to say sorry
for how everyone was.</i>

1792
01:20:20,229 --> 01:20:22,528
<i>And, uh...</i>

1793
01:20:22,530 --> 01:20:25,767
I guess, I wanted to ask,
what are you gonna do?

1794
01:20:28,803 --> 01:20:30,137
What do you mean?

1795
01:20:30,139 --> 01:20:31,105
<i>Well, the...</i>

1796
01:20:31,107 --> 01:20:33,642
<i>You know, with the will,
what are you gonna do?</i>

1797
01:20:36,611 --> 01:20:39,113
What do you
think I should do?

1798
01:20:39,115 --> 01:20:43,685
<i>You should do
whatever you think is right.</i>

1799
01:20:44,019 --> 01:20:45,187
Mmm-hmm.

1800
01:20:46,621 --> 01:20:47,622
Look, I...

1801
01:20:49,758 --> 01:20:51,593
I think you should
give it back to us.

1802
01:20:53,862 --> 01:20:56,062
<i>Granddad always
took care of us.</i>

1803
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:57,797
<i>You know, we're his family.</i>

1804
01:20:57,799 --> 01:20:59,666
<i>And I know
he was like family to you,</i>

1805
01:20:59,668 --> 01:21:01,203
<i>but we're his actual family.</i>

1806
01:21:01,636 --> 01:21:02,735
Yeah.

1807
01:21:02,737 --> 01:21:04,637
And... Look, Marta,

1808
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:07,141
you know this isn't fair.

1809
01:21:07,143 --> 01:21:08,741
We've always been good to you

1810
01:21:08,743 --> 01:21:11,811
<i>and you're like family,
and we'll take care of you,</i>

1811
01:21:11,813 --> 01:21:13,782
<i>but you have
to make things right.</i>

1812
01:21:14,582 --> 01:21:15,650
<i>You know what's right.</i>

1813
01:21:16,818 --> 01:21:17,819
<i>Marta...</i>

1814
01:21:20,722 --> 01:21:22,256
Mom's broke.

1815
01:21:22,258 --> 01:21:24,824
<i>And she says I'm gonna
have to drop out of school.</i>

1816
01:21:24,826 --> 01:21:26,494
No. No, no, Meg.

1817
01:21:27,896 --> 01:21:29,896
Listen, I won't
let that happen.

1818
01:21:29,898 --> 01:21:32,232
<i>Whatever money you need,
I'll give it to you.</i>

1819
01:21:32,234 --> 01:21:33,466
<i>I'm here for you.</i>

1820
01:21:33,468 --> 01:21:35,235
<i>And I want you to know
I'm gonna take care of you,</i>

1821
01:21:35,237 --> 01:21:36,238
<i>I promise that.</i>

1822
01:21:36,738 --> 01:21:37,804
<i>Okay?</i>

1823
01:21:37,806 --> 01:21:39,239
Thanks.

1824
01:21:39,241 --> 01:21:41,077
<i>And once I...</i>

1825
01:21:59,928 --> 01:22:01,995
Okay then.

1826
01:22:01,997 --> 01:22:04,833
Did Blanc find anything
suspicious at the house?

1827
01:22:06,935 --> 01:22:09,303
Yes, he found mud upstairs.

1828
01:22:09,305 --> 01:22:11,171
Where I broke in
through the window.

1829
01:22:11,173 --> 01:22:12,239
Shit.

1830
01:22:12,241 --> 01:22:13,508
Identifiable prints?

1831
01:22:14,009 --> 01:22:15,075
No.

1832
01:22:15,077 --> 01:22:16,578
Good. Okay.

1833
01:22:17,313 --> 01:22:19,146
Good. Hey...

1834
01:22:19,148 --> 01:22:20,780
You lay low
for a couple days,

1835
01:22:20,782 --> 01:22:22,316
wait for this investigation
to blow over,

1836
01:22:22,318 --> 01:22:23,417
and it will.

1837
01:22:23,419 --> 01:22:25,785
'Cause no matter how good
this Blanc guy thinks he is,

1838
01:22:25,787 --> 01:22:26,955
he's got nothin'.

1839
01:22:27,622 --> 01:22:30,257
Hey, relax.

1840
01:22:31,893 --> 01:22:33,059
Marta, get your ass up!

1841
01:22:33,061 --> 01:22:33,960
What the hell
is happening?

1842
01:22:33,962 --> 01:22:35,695
There's a guy here,
and a bunch of stuff.

1843
01:22:35,697 --> 01:22:37,199
Everything's going crazy.
Are we rich?

1844
01:22:39,067 --> 01:22:40,933
Maybe, Alice.
I don't know.

1845
01:22:40,935 --> 01:22:42,035
I don't even know
what that means,

1846
01:22:42,037 --> 01:22:43,103
but you better get
your ass up, okay?

1847
01:22:45,006 --> 01:22:46,939
<i>We don't know much
about Marta Cabrera,</i>

1848
01:22:46,941 --> 01:22:48,708
- <i>or her exact relationship...</i>
- Oh, my God...

1849
01:22:48,710 --> 01:22:50,144
- <i>...with Harlan Thrombey...</i>
- Marta, what is all this?

1850
01:22:50,146 --> 01:22:52,678
- <i>...beyond being his home nurse.</i>
- What did you do?

1851
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:53,780
Is that here?

1852
01:22:53,782 --> 01:22:55,048
Oh, yeah, it is.

1853
01:22:55,050 --> 01:22:57,750
Wait, so is that true?

1854
01:22:57,752 --> 01:22:58,753
Are we rich?

1855
01:23:00,622 --> 01:23:01,721
<i>This is
a story so compelling...</i>

1856
01:23:01,723 --> 01:23:02,789
Oh, my God.

1857
01:23:02,791 --> 01:23:04,759
<i>...you would think he had
written the story himself.</i>

1858
01:23:17,406 --> 01:23:19,341
Good morning,
Mrs. Thrombey.

1859
01:23:24,879 --> 01:23:27,649
Why is grief
the providence of youth?

1860
01:23:29,050 --> 01:23:30,252
I don't know.

1861
01:23:32,854 --> 01:23:37,093
But I'd imagine that age
deepens all feelings.

1862
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:40,129
Including grief.

1863
01:23:42,997 --> 01:23:47,635
This was a long walk
to offering condolences

1864
01:23:48,370 --> 01:23:50,004
for the loss of your son.

1865
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:53,973
And asking you,
if it isn't presumptuous of me,

1866
01:23:53,975 --> 01:23:58,245
not to think too harshly
of your family,

1867
01:23:58,247 --> 01:24:02,951
if I am, as I suspect,
the first to console you.

1868
01:24:04,420 --> 01:24:07,021
They're young, aren't they?

1869
01:24:12,328 --> 01:24:15,397
One thing I assume of age

1870
01:24:16,030 --> 01:24:18,198
is weariness.

1871
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:21,468
Damned if I don't get
more tired every day.

1872
01:24:21,470 --> 01:24:23,903
Tired of what I do.

1873
01:24:23,905 --> 01:24:26,939
Following arcs
like lobbed rocks,

1874
01:24:26,941 --> 01:24:29,111
the inevitability of truth.

1875
01:24:32,148 --> 01:24:34,183
But the complexity and the gray

1876
01:24:35,317 --> 01:24:37,051
lie not in the truth

1877
01:24:38,454 --> 01:24:41,789
but what you do with the truth
once you have it.

1878
01:24:49,231 --> 01:24:52,201
I think you have something
you wanna tell me.

1879
01:24:54,002 --> 01:24:56,903
I think you're
very perceptive

1880
01:24:56,905 --> 01:25:00,140
and very capable of
telling me what you saw

1881
01:25:00,142 --> 01:25:02,178
the night
of your son's party.

1882
01:25:10,419 --> 01:25:12,221
But I'll happily wait.

1883
01:25:13,054 --> 01:25:14,390
I'm in no rush.

1884
01:25:15,890 --> 01:25:17,023
In fact,

1885
01:25:17,025 --> 01:25:19,126
I find it quiet pleasant

1886
01:25:19,128 --> 01:25:20,795
sitting here with you.

1887
01:25:29,037 --> 01:25:30,204
Lawyers were here.

1888
01:25:30,206 --> 01:25:31,804
Very big lawyers,
it looked like.

1889
01:25:31,806 --> 01:25:33,940
They left all this stuff
and business cards.

1890
01:25:33,942 --> 01:25:35,309
And there was
a pile of other stuff

1891
01:25:35,311 --> 01:25:37,211
when I got home.

1892
01:25:37,213 --> 01:25:39,011
I don't like
any of this, Marta.

1893
01:25:39,881 --> 01:25:41,415
I don't like it either.

1894
01:25:41,417 --> 01:25:43,417
I'm slipping out the back.

1895
01:25:43,419 --> 01:25:45,987
I'll be back later.
Please don't talk to anyone.

1896
01:25:52,561 --> 01:25:53,761
Walt?

1897
01:25:54,530 --> 01:25:57,130
Yeah, I came, uh...

1898
01:25:57,132 --> 01:25:58,432
Hey, how you doin'?

1899
01:26:01,170 --> 01:26:02,369
Walt, I want you to know

1900
01:26:02,371 --> 01:26:03,936
that I didn't know
about any of this.

1901
01:26:03,938 --> 01:26:05,272
- We know you didn't.
- This is...

1902
01:26:05,274 --> 01:26:07,074
We know you didn't.

1903
01:26:07,076 --> 01:26:10,077
Yeah, we all kind of went
a little crazy yesterday.

1904
01:26:10,079 --> 01:26:11,779
- Understandable.
- Yeah.

1905
01:26:13,249 --> 01:26:15,215
I haven't even
looked at all this, yet.

1906
01:26:15,217 --> 01:26:17,984
It must just be
local lawyers and accountants

1907
01:26:17,986 --> 01:26:20,387
who saw the news
and wanna get a jump on it.

1908
01:26:20,389 --> 01:26:22,757
Yeah. I'd be careful
of all of it.

1909
01:26:24,926 --> 01:26:29,098
Marta, is it your intention
to renounce the inheritance?

1910
01:26:32,368 --> 01:26:34,802
This is what Harlan wanted.

1911
01:26:36,572 --> 01:26:38,472
Yeah, but...

1912
01:26:38,474 --> 01:26:41,210
Harlan put you in a very hard
position here. I mean,

1913
01:26:41,976 --> 01:26:43,112
it was unfair of him.

1914
01:26:44,146 --> 01:26:45,845
I mean, you see

1915
01:26:45,847 --> 01:26:48,981
the kind of press and scrutiny
that this kicks up

1916
01:26:48,983 --> 01:26:51,553
and we know,
with your mother...

1917
01:26:53,054 --> 01:26:54,154
My mother?

1918
01:26:54,156 --> 01:26:55,157
Yeah.

1919
01:27:00,529 --> 01:27:03,130
What did Meg tell you?

1920
01:27:03,132 --> 01:27:04,799
Oh, this isn't about...

1921
01:27:06,535 --> 01:27:07,967
You're missing the point.

1922
01:27:07,969 --> 01:27:10,036
We don't wanna
attack you with this,

1923
01:27:10,038 --> 01:27:11,371
but, Marta, if your mother

1924
01:27:11,373 --> 01:27:14,006
came into the
country illegally,

1925
01:27:14,008 --> 01:27:15,208
criminally.

1926
01:27:15,210 --> 01:27:17,144
And you've come
into this inheritance,

1927
01:27:17,146 --> 01:27:18,978
with all the scrutiny
that entails,

1928
01:27:18,980 --> 01:27:21,381
I'd be afraid
that could come to light.

1929
01:27:21,383 --> 01:27:23,450
And that's what
we wanna avoid here.

1930
01:27:23,452 --> 01:27:24,553
We can protect you

1931
01:27:25,487 --> 01:27:26,886
from that happening,

1932
01:27:26,888 --> 01:27:28,888
or if it happens.

1933
01:27:28,890 --> 01:27:33,327
So you're saying that
even if it came to light,

1934
01:27:33,329 --> 01:27:36,096
with your family's resources,
you could help me fix it?

1935
01:27:36,098 --> 01:27:37,397
Yeah.

1936
01:27:37,399 --> 01:27:39,533
Yeah, with the right
lawyers, you know?

1937
01:27:39,535 --> 01:27:41,000
Not these local guys,

1938
01:27:41,002 --> 01:27:43,570
but New York lawyers,
DC lawyers,

1939
01:27:43,572 --> 01:27:46,038
with enough resources
put toward it, yes.

1940
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:49,043
Not that that ever even
needs to come up,

1941
01:27:49,944 --> 01:27:50,945
but, yes.

1942
01:27:52,381 --> 01:27:53,582
Okay, good.

1943
01:27:55,484 --> 01:27:56,485
Okay?

1944
01:27:57,453 --> 01:28:01,521
Because Harlan gave me
all your resources.

1945
01:28:01,523 --> 01:28:03,190
So that means
with my resources,

1946
01:28:03,192 --> 01:28:04,924
I'll be able to fix it.

1947
01:28:04,926 --> 01:28:06,992
So I guess
I will find the right lawyers.

1948
01:28:06,994 --> 01:28:08,230
Uh, Marta, that's...

1949
01:28:10,699 --> 01:28:12,501
You better be sure that's

1950
01:28:13,935 --> 01:28:15,137
what you want.

1951
01:28:53,242 --> 01:28:55,108
I don't know...
What's this?

1952
01:28:55,110 --> 01:28:56,610
It's my
medical bag tag.

1953
01:28:56,612 --> 01:28:59,379
They have my medical bag
for some reason.

1954
01:28:59,381 --> 01:29:01,648
Okay, but this is a photocopy
of just the header

1955
01:29:01,650 --> 01:29:04,584
of a blood toxicology report
on Harlan.

1956
01:29:04,586 --> 01:29:07,320
Marta, this is gonna show
the morphine overdose.

1957
01:29:10,292 --> 01:29:11,293
So I'm screwed?

1958
01:29:13,395 --> 01:29:15,162
How do you know all this stuff?

1959
01:29:15,164 --> 01:29:17,332
I was Harlan's research
assistant for a summer.

1960
01:29:18,467 --> 01:29:20,500
But what kind of
blackmail scheme is this?

1961
01:29:20,502 --> 01:29:22,001
I mean, the actual evidence

1962
01:29:22,003 --> 01:29:24,069
is sitting up the street,
at the crime lab.

1963
01:29:24,071 --> 01:29:26,275
There's no demands,
there's no meeting place.

1964
01:29:28,510 --> 01:29:30,312
What's the point
in sending you this?

1965
01:29:40,622 --> 01:29:41,755
It could be
a half hour.

1966
01:29:41,757 --> 01:29:43,356
It could be an hour.
It depends.

1967
01:29:43,358 --> 01:29:44,526
We wanna make sure...

1968
01:29:51,767 --> 01:29:53,333
So, it could take a while.

1969
01:29:53,335 --> 01:29:54,634
- What's the cheese?
- But I'll let you know.

1970
01:29:54,636 --> 01:29:56,203
- Oh, hey.
- Yeah.

1971
01:29:56,205 --> 01:29:57,637
- Thank you, Chief.
- No problem.

1972
01:29:57,639 --> 01:29:58,572
5:00 a.m.

1973
01:29:58,574 --> 01:30:00,807
Security systems
here are all triggered.

1974
01:30:00,809 --> 01:30:02,709
Now, this thing
went up really quick,

1975
01:30:02,711 --> 01:30:04,611
so that means
blood stores, records,

1976
01:30:04,613 --> 01:30:06,813
anything of that nature,
it's all gone.

1977
01:30:06,815 --> 01:30:08,482
There were no
employees here,

1978
01:30:08,484 --> 01:30:10,684
- so, thank God for that.
- Mmm-hmm.

1979
01:30:10,686 --> 01:30:12,554
What about security cameras?

1980
01:30:13,155 --> 01:30:14,156
Oh, yeah.

1981
01:30:16,558 --> 01:30:18,291
Speaking of security,

1982
01:30:18,293 --> 01:30:19,759
the surveillance tape
at the Thrombey estate

1983
01:30:19,761 --> 01:30:22,063
was all scrambled
for some reason.

1984
01:30:22,331 --> 01:30:24,264
Yeah.

1985
01:30:24,266 --> 01:30:27,066
What's still pending
from the autopsy?

1986
01:30:27,068 --> 01:30:28,537
Just a report
on the blood work.

1987
01:30:30,272 --> 01:30:31,373
Blood work?

1988
01:30:36,378 --> 01:30:37,746
Holy shit.

1989
01:30:41,250 --> 01:30:42,618
This is insane.

1990
01:30:44,253 --> 01:30:46,753
I mean, who would blow up
a whole real building

1991
01:30:46,755 --> 01:30:48,154
just to blackmail me?

1992
01:30:48,156 --> 01:30:49,356
Marta, this means
the blackmailer

1993
01:30:49,358 --> 01:30:50,590
has the only paper copy

1994
01:30:50,592 --> 01:30:52,359
of the thing that
can prove your guilt.

1995
01:30:52,361 --> 01:30:53,793
You didn't get
any other instructions?

1996
01:30:53,795 --> 01:30:55,529
No phone call?
No email? Nothing?

1997
01:30:55,531 --> 01:30:57,497
No.

1998
01:30:57,499 --> 01:30:59,468
Well, I haven't
checked my email.

1999
01:31:04,706 --> 01:31:06,406
There is one.

2000
01:31:06,408 --> 01:31:09,778
Yeah, that's it.
"1209, Columbus Road. 10 a.m."

2001
01:31:16,184 --> 01:31:17,284
You know
what this means, right?

2002
01:31:17,286 --> 01:31:18,818
If you destroy that copy,

2003
01:31:18,820 --> 01:31:20,389
you're totally in the clear.

2004
01:31:21,156 --> 01:31:22,324
Oh, no.

2005
01:31:23,692 --> 01:31:25,360
Marta, did you hear me?

2006
01:31:27,729 --> 01:31:28,730
Yeah.

2007
01:31:36,838 --> 01:31:38,238
Elliott!

2008
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:39,408
We gotta go!
We gotta go!

2009
01:31:42,344 --> 01:31:44,544
- Okay, baby driver.
- Oh, God.

2010
01:31:44,546 --> 01:31:45,879
You regret helping me yet?

2011
01:31:45,881 --> 01:31:47,547
I regret not
taking the Beemer.

2012
01:31:49,618 --> 01:31:51,318
Oh, shit.

2013
01:32:04,833 --> 01:32:05,899
Vehicles in pursuit

2014
01:32:05,901 --> 01:32:06,866
- on Washington Street.
- No force.

2015
01:32:06,868 --> 01:32:08,468
- Make sure you say "no force."
- No force.

2016
01:32:08,470 --> 01:32:09,536
We got a possible
murder suspect.

2017
01:32:09,538 --> 01:32:10,706
I said that. I said that.

2018
01:32:12,708 --> 01:32:14,741
Go. Go! Go!
Are you flooring it?

2019
01:32:14,743 --> 01:32:16,445
I am literally flooring it!

2020
01:32:27,522 --> 01:32:29,356
- This is going well.
- I'm pulling over. I'm...

2021
01:32:29,358 --> 01:32:30,423
If you miss your chance

2022
01:32:30,425 --> 01:32:31,827
to get this tox report,
it's all over.

2023
01:32:32,527 --> 01:32:33,729
Oh, my God.

2024
01:32:36,865 --> 01:32:38,598
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

2025
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:39,966
Why... Why are we stopping?

2026
01:32:39,968 --> 01:32:42,337
Why are you stopping
in the middle of the road?

2027
01:32:55,384 --> 01:32:56,385
Hold on.

2028
01:33:20,375 --> 01:33:22,876
Oh, my God, I'm just
pure adrenaline right now.

2029
01:33:22,878 --> 01:33:24,778
I feel like I swallowed bees.

2030
01:33:24,780 --> 01:33:25,645
Okay...

2031
01:33:25,647 --> 01:33:27,447
So where is it?
What's the address?

2032
01:33:27,449 --> 01:33:28,882
1209, Columbus Road.

2033
01:33:28,884 --> 01:33:30,784
Okay. I mean,
whatever they want,

2034
01:33:30,786 --> 01:33:32,252
- I'll say yes...
- Anything.

2035
01:33:32,254 --> 01:33:33,620
You know, just to get
that report back.

2036
01:33:33,622 --> 01:33:35,789
- Get it back and destroy it.
- Destroy it.

2037
01:33:35,791 --> 01:33:37,359
Holy shit, Ransom.

2038
01:33:38,026 --> 01:33:39,628
Hey, thank you.

2039
01:33:40,562 --> 01:33:42,230
I couldn't do this without you.

2040
01:33:45,367 --> 01:33:47,335
Oh, my God.

2041
01:33:48,804 --> 01:33:49,805
Get out.

2042
01:33:51,606 --> 01:33:54,708
That was the dumbest
car chase of all time.

2043
01:33:54,710 --> 01:33:56,042
Put your hands down.

2044
01:33:56,044 --> 01:33:58,712
I spoke to Wanetta Thrombey,
Greatnana.

2045
01:33:58,714 --> 01:34:00,547
Night of the party,
she saw someone

2046
01:34:00,549 --> 01:34:03,283
climbing the trellis
to the third floor.

2047
01:34:03,285 --> 01:34:05,719
- Mr. Drysdale, come on.
- Let's go.

2048
01:34:05,721 --> 01:34:07,654
Pat him down,
check him out.

2049
01:34:07,656 --> 01:34:09,456
What's going on?

2050
01:34:09,458 --> 01:34:11,357
"Ransom came back,"
she said.

2051
01:34:11,359 --> 01:34:12,592
Hands on the vehicle.

2052
01:34:12,594 --> 01:34:13,827
I don't know
what he came back to do,

2053
01:34:13,829 --> 01:34:14,994
but we'll find out.

2054
01:34:14,996 --> 01:34:17,330
You got anything sharp?

2055
01:34:17,332 --> 01:34:19,299
Watch your head. Thank you.

2056
01:34:19,301 --> 01:34:20,266
Hey, you don't need
to thank him.

2057
01:34:20,268 --> 01:34:23,472
Did he ask you to drive
when he saw me coming?

2058
01:34:25,006 --> 01:34:26,308
Yes.

2059
01:34:33,749 --> 01:34:35,381
Blanc, coming with us?

2060
01:34:35,383 --> 01:34:37,650
I'll drive with Marta.

2061
01:34:37,652 --> 01:34:39,352
Let's go to the
police station.

2062
01:34:39,354 --> 01:34:42,756
I want a full rundown
on everything he said to you.

2063
01:34:42,758 --> 01:34:44,493
I'll catch you up
on where we're at.

2064
01:34:51,533 --> 01:34:54,302
<i>Strange case from the start.</i>

2065
01:34:55,470 --> 01:34:58,507
A case with a hole
in the middle.

2066
01:35:00,509 --> 01:35:01,710
A donut.

2067
01:35:02,744 --> 01:35:05,378
I'm just talking
through my process here,

2068
01:35:05,380 --> 01:35:07,714
let me know
if this is boring.

2069
01:35:07,716 --> 01:35:09,849
I feel the noose tightening.

2070
01:35:09,851 --> 01:35:12,454
The family is
truly desperate.

2071
01:35:12,988 --> 01:35:14,589
Desperate motives,

2072
01:35:15,457 --> 01:35:17,590
the mystery of who hired me,

2073
01:35:17,592 --> 01:35:19,394
the impossibility of the crime,

2074
01:35:20,462 --> 01:35:21,830
and yet...

2075
01:35:22,764 --> 01:35:24,664
A donut.

2076
01:35:24,666 --> 01:35:27,367
One central piece

2077
01:35:27,369 --> 01:35:30,470
and if it reveals itself,
the fog would lift,

2078
01:35:30,472 --> 01:35:34,674
the arc would resolve,
the Slinky become unkinked.

2079
01:35:34,676 --> 01:35:36,676
Do you mind
if I stop for a second?

2080
01:35:36,678 --> 01:35:38,145
I need to pick something up.

2081
01:35:38,147 --> 01:35:39,581
It'll be very quick.

2082
01:35:40,882 --> 01:35:42,050
Sure.

2083
01:35:55,664 --> 01:35:56,996
It'll be just a few minutes.

2084
01:35:56,998 --> 01:35:58,400
Watch the, uh,

2085
01:35:59,034 --> 01:36:00,035
door.

2086
01:36:22,591 --> 01:36:23,625
Hello?

2087
01:36:47,482 --> 01:36:49,484
Listen, I don't know
what you want...

2088
01:36:52,053 --> 01:36:54,053
Whatever it is,
we can work it out.

2089
01:36:54,055 --> 01:36:56,789
But we have to figure it out
right here, right now.

2090
01:36:56,791 --> 01:36:58,660
And I'm leaving
with that report.

2091
01:37:03,099 --> 01:37:04,432
Hello?

2092
01:37:29,624 --> 01:37:30,625
Fran?

2093
01:37:40,635 --> 01:37:43,069
No, no, no, no! Fran?

2094
01:37:43,071 --> 01:37:45,272
Oh, my God, Fran.

2095
01:37:45,274 --> 01:37:47,040
Can you hear me?

2096
01:37:47,042 --> 01:37:49,243
Fran, give me a sign
if you can hear me.

2097
01:37:49,245 --> 01:37:51,678
- You...
- Yes, it's me. It's Marta.

2098
01:37:51,680 --> 01:37:53,680
You called me here,
you sent me an email,

2099
01:37:53,682 --> 01:37:55,815
that's why I'm here.
Did you take something?

2100
01:37:55,817 --> 01:37:58,118
I'm gonna call an ambulance
now, you're gonna be okay.

2101
01:37:58,120 --> 01:37:59,286
You're gonna be fine, okay?

2102
01:37:59,288 --> 01:38:00,720
- Stay with me.
- Copy...

2103
01:38:00,722 --> 01:38:02,124
- What?
- Copy...

2104
01:38:03,225 --> 01:38:04,557
Stashed...

2105
01:38:04,559 --> 01:38:05,827
What? What are you saying?

2106
01:38:07,062 --> 01:38:09,263
You did this.

2107
01:38:09,265 --> 01:38:11,597
Won't get away with this.

2108
01:38:11,599 --> 01:38:12,767
Jesus, stop it!

2109
01:38:34,990 --> 01:38:36,992
<i>911,
what's your emergency?</i>

2110
01:38:38,227 --> 01:38:43,062
<i>♪ The thought of you
stays bright</i>

2111
01:38:44,300 --> 01:38:49,205
<i>♪ Sometimes I stand

2112
01:38:50,839 --> 01:38:54,709
<i>♪ Not going left</i>

2113
01:38:55,910 --> 01:38:57,010
<i>♪ Not going...</i>

2114
01:38:57,012 --> 01:38:58,845
Oh, Lord.

2115
01:39:00,349 --> 01:39:03,018
All right, my friend,
thank you for the update.

2116
01:39:04,120 --> 01:39:05,219
No need for that.

2117
01:39:05,221 --> 01:39:07,053
I'll bring her in
once we get word

2118
01:39:07,055 --> 01:39:08,788
that the housekeeper
is stable.

2119
01:39:08,790 --> 01:39:10,025
It's still
touch and go.

2120
01:39:10,692 --> 01:39:11,693
All right.

2121
01:39:13,095 --> 01:39:14,228
Listen, this is over.

2122
01:39:14,230 --> 01:39:15,864
People are getting hurt.

2123
01:39:18,666 --> 01:39:19,799
So I'm gonna
tell you the truth.

2124
01:39:19,801 --> 01:39:23,605
Young Ransom just told
Lieutenant Elliott everything.

2125
01:39:24,039 --> 01:39:24,904
Good.

2126
01:39:24,906 --> 01:39:27,174
Wait, I hope he
didn't cover for me.

2127
01:39:27,176 --> 01:39:28,841
Did he tell you
the real truth

2128
01:39:28,843 --> 01:39:30,877
- about me switching the...
- Yeah.

2129
01:39:30,879 --> 01:39:32,246
- And the disguise bit?
- Yes.

2130
01:39:32,248 --> 01:39:33,880
And the whole blackmail and...

2131
01:39:33,882 --> 01:39:35,182
Mmm-hmm.

2132
01:39:35,184 --> 01:39:37,650
But why did Fran
take my morphine?

2133
01:39:37,652 --> 01:39:39,952
I mean, obviously she had
swiped the bag from the house,

2134
01:39:39,954 --> 01:39:41,988
but she didn't seem like
a user to me,

2135
01:39:41,990 --> 01:39:44,291
unless that's why she needed
the blackmail money.

2136
01:39:44,293 --> 01:39:46,226
I don't know,
it doesn't matter anyway.

2137
01:39:46,228 --> 01:39:48,128
I have to tell the
Thrombeys myself,

2138
01:39:48,130 --> 01:39:49,196
I feel like I owe that to them.

2139
01:39:49,198 --> 01:39:50,930
I don't think
that's a good idea.

2140
01:39:50,932 --> 01:39:53,034
No, I have to do it.
I need to do it.

2141
01:39:55,003 --> 01:39:56,403
I gave the doctors
my number,

2142
01:39:56,405 --> 01:39:58,205
so they'll call if anything
changes with Fran.

2143
01:39:58,207 --> 01:39:59,173
All right.

2144
01:39:59,175 --> 01:40:01,108
I'll round up the Thrombeys
at the house,

2145
01:40:01,110 --> 01:40:03,210
along with a police escort.

2146
01:40:03,212 --> 01:40:05,412
For the arrest after.

2147
01:40:05,414 --> 01:40:07,949
You can tell me your whole
story on the drive over.

2148
01:40:09,185 --> 01:40:11,120
I don't want
any more surprises.

2149
01:40:26,935 --> 01:40:28,435
Fran said
it was stashed,

2150
01:40:28,437 --> 01:40:29,904
the copy, and then she said,

2151
01:40:31,072 --> 01:40:33,307
"You did this.
You won't get away with it,"

2152
01:40:33,309 --> 01:40:36,010
and I called the ambulance.

2153
01:40:36,778 --> 01:40:37,879
That's it.

2154
01:40:39,081 --> 01:40:40,082
All right.

2155
01:40:42,251 --> 01:40:44,686
You ready?

2156
01:40:49,325 --> 01:40:50,723
Oh!

2157
01:40:50,725 --> 01:40:52,159
Okay.

2158
01:40:52,161 --> 01:40:54,194
Well, has she
come to her senses?

2159
01:40:54,196 --> 01:40:55,828
Well, she's standing
right there, Richard,

2160
01:40:55,830 --> 01:40:56,896
she can speak for herself.

2161
01:40:56,898 --> 01:40:57,964
Is the rest
of the family here?

2162
01:40:57,966 --> 01:40:59,031
In the living room.

2163
01:40:59,033 --> 01:41:00,066
I think that it
would be better

2164
01:41:00,068 --> 01:41:02,371
if we were to gather again
and get this over with.

2165
01:41:08,042 --> 01:41:09,411
- Hey.
- Hey.

2166
01:41:11,813 --> 01:41:13,779
I'm so sorry I told
them about your mom.

2167
01:41:13,781 --> 01:41:16,216
Meg, it's okay.

2168
01:41:16,218 --> 01:41:17,850
I'm sorry. No...
I was scared. I just...

2169
01:41:17,852 --> 01:41:18,951
I didn't wanna tell them.

2170
01:41:18,953 --> 01:41:20,021
I get it.

2171
01:41:20,456 --> 01:41:21,689
Trust me,

2172
01:41:22,458 --> 01:41:24,726
I understand.
It's all right.

2173
01:41:25,294 --> 01:41:26,828
I'm sorry.

2174
01:41:30,031 --> 01:41:32,865
God, I am so raiding
Fran's stash after this.

2175
01:41:32,867 --> 01:41:36,002
I still think
this is a bad idea,

2176
01:41:36,004 --> 01:41:38,140
but the family is assembled.

2177
01:41:41,410 --> 01:41:43,279
I know where
the tox report is.

2178
01:41:50,952 --> 01:41:52,687
She basically told me
where it was.

2179
01:41:55,124 --> 01:41:57,025
Anyways, this will
tie everything up.

2180
01:41:59,261 --> 01:42:00,895
And I just
handed it to you.

2181
01:42:02,364 --> 01:42:04,899
God, you're not much
of a detective, are you?

2182
01:42:05,401 --> 01:42:07,068
Well, to be fair,

2183
01:42:08,937 --> 01:42:11,273
you make
a pretty lousy murderer.

2184
01:42:13,275 --> 01:42:15,043
Perhaps we
deserve each other.

2185
01:42:27,223 --> 01:42:28,923
You've always
been good to me.

2186
01:42:30,892 --> 01:42:33,059
And what I'm about to say
isn't gonna be easy

2187
01:42:33,061 --> 01:42:35,128
and you're gonna
be upset.

2188
01:42:35,130 --> 01:42:37,264
But I thought after
what you've gone through

2189
01:42:37,266 --> 01:42:38,334
the last few days,

2190
01:42:39,501 --> 01:42:42,034
that you deserved
to hear it from me.

2191
01:42:42,036 --> 01:42:43,172
Hmm.

2192
01:42:45,006 --> 01:42:46,275
- I...
- Excuse me!

2193
01:42:50,579 --> 01:42:53,846
You have not been good to her.

2194
01:42:53,848 --> 01:42:56,015
You have all
treated her like shit,

2195
01:42:56,017 --> 01:42:58,452
to steal back a fortune
that you lost,

2196
01:42:58,454 --> 01:43:00,187
and she deserves.

2197
01:43:00,189 --> 01:43:03,190
You're a pack of vultures
at the feast!

2198
01:43:03,192 --> 01:43:05,158
Knives out, beaks bloody!

2199
01:43:05,160 --> 01:43:07,127
Well...

2200
01:43:07,129 --> 01:43:10,497
You're not getting bailed
out, not this time.

2201
01:43:10,499 --> 01:43:13,400
Ms. Cabrera has
decided, definitively,

2202
01:43:13,402 --> 01:43:15,302
not to renounce
the inheritance.

2203
01:43:15,304 --> 01:43:17,137
- What?
- What?

2204
01:43:17,139 --> 01:43:20,140
Furthermore, it will be
my professional recommendation

2205
01:43:20,142 --> 01:43:22,576
to the local authorities
that the manner of death

2206
01:43:22,578 --> 01:43:26,580
in the case of Harlan Thrombey
is ruled as suicide!

2207
01:43:26,582 --> 01:43:28,248
- And the case is closed.
- Blanc?

2208
01:43:28,250 --> 01:43:29,316
What?

2209
01:43:29,318 --> 01:43:31,118
Thank you all for coming.
Goodbye.

2210
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:32,521
What's going on?
Just tell me...

2211
01:43:34,490 --> 01:43:37,157
That's certainly not
what I was expecting.

2212
01:43:37,159 --> 01:43:38,392
No.

2213
01:43:38,394 --> 01:43:39,359
Is anybody else confused?

2214
01:43:39,361 --> 01:43:41,829
Not what I was expecting
to hear at all.

2215
01:43:44,366 --> 01:43:45,965
Are you gonna tell me
what the hell is going on?

2216
01:43:45,967 --> 01:43:47,200
Yes. Yes.

2217
01:43:47,202 --> 01:43:49,068
I just wanna come clean, okay?

2218
01:43:49,070 --> 01:43:50,370
- It's over.
- Almost.

2219
01:43:50,372 --> 01:43:51,871
Blanc, what are we doing?

2220
01:43:51,873 --> 01:43:54,241
- What's going on?
- I'm sorry. Officer Wagner.

2221
01:43:54,243 --> 01:43:55,975
Keep the family
out of this room,

2222
01:43:55,977 --> 01:43:57,377
and get 'em out of
the house if you can.

2223
01:43:57,379 --> 01:43:59,513
But stand by
with your additional officer.

2224
01:43:59,515 --> 01:44:00,547
Get the family out?

2225
01:44:00,549 --> 01:44:02,482
Yes, but not all of them.
Would you...

2226
01:44:02,484 --> 01:44:03,583
Thank you.

2227
01:44:03,585 --> 01:44:04,518
- Blanc...
- Yes, sir.

2228
01:44:04,520 --> 01:44:06,386
Come on, come on,
what's all this drama?

2229
01:44:06,388 --> 01:44:08,221
- Indulge me.
- Blanc,

2230
01:44:08,223 --> 01:44:10,090
I told Ransom, Ransom told you,

2231
01:44:10,092 --> 01:44:11,625
and I'm telling you now,

2232
01:44:11,627 --> 01:44:14,594
it is an immovable fact
that I killed Harlan.

2233
01:44:14,596 --> 01:44:17,264
Yes, you did, yes, he did,
yes, you are.

2234
01:44:17,266 --> 01:44:20,467
But... But, I spoke in the car
about the hole

2235
01:44:20,469 --> 01:44:22,602
at the center of this donut.

2236
01:44:22,604 --> 01:44:25,339
And what you and Harlan did
that fateful night

2237
01:44:25,341 --> 01:44:28,542
seems at first glance
to fill that hole perfectly.

2238
01:44:28,544 --> 01:44:31,944
A donut hole in a donut's hole.

2239
01:44:31,946 --> 01:44:34,548
But we must
look a little closer.

2240
01:44:34,550 --> 01:44:37,584
And when we do,
we see the donut hole

2241
01:44:37,586 --> 01:44:39,985
has a hole in its center.

2242
01:44:39,987 --> 01:44:42,155
It is not a donut hole,

2243
01:44:42,157 --> 01:44:45,125
but a smaller donut
with its own hole

2244
01:44:45,127 --> 01:44:48,095
and our donut
is not whole at all!

2245
01:44:48,097 --> 01:44:50,263
Blanc, look, I understand that
this is amusing for you...

2246
01:44:50,265 --> 01:44:52,468
Why was I hired?

2247
01:44:53,268 --> 01:44:55,000
Why would someone hire me?

2248
01:44:55,002 --> 01:44:56,403
Someone fishing
for a crime

2249
01:44:56,405 --> 01:44:57,704
to reverse the will, Blanc.
Come on.

2250
01:44:57,706 --> 01:45:00,207
But I was hired before
the sealed will was read.

2251
01:45:00,209 --> 01:45:01,508
So, yes,

2252
01:45:01,510 --> 01:45:04,644
the person must have known
the contents of the will.

2253
01:45:04,646 --> 01:45:05,746
But one step further,

2254
01:45:05,748 --> 01:45:09,149
that same person must have
known a crime was committed,

2255
01:45:09,151 --> 01:45:11,084
and further...

2256
01:45:11,086 --> 01:45:16,123
If the intent was to reverse
Marta's inheritance,

2257
01:45:16,125 --> 01:45:19,192
they must have known
that Marta was responsible.

2258
01:45:19,194 --> 01:45:21,561
An intriguing combination
of factors.

2259
01:45:21,563 --> 01:45:23,363
Someone who knew
what Marta did

2260
01:45:23,365 --> 01:45:25,030
wanted to expose it

2261
01:45:25,032 --> 01:45:27,066
but could not reveal
how they knew.

2262
01:45:27,068 --> 01:45:28,435
Fran!

2263
01:45:28,437 --> 01:45:31,271
She was blackmailing me.
She knew what I did.

2264
01:45:31,273 --> 01:45:32,606
Yeah, but Fran wanted money,

2265
01:45:32,608 --> 01:45:35,075
ergo she did not want
the crime exposed.

2266
01:45:35,077 --> 01:45:36,610
What if someone
in the family had observed

2267
01:45:36,612 --> 01:45:37,711
Marta doing
something suspicious?

2268
01:45:37,713 --> 01:45:41,116
But they would have had
no reason not to speak up.

2269
01:45:42,751 --> 01:45:46,753
The answer
is not so simple.

2270
01:45:46,755 --> 01:45:51,324
Now with the entire solution
in my field of view,

2271
01:45:51,326 --> 01:45:54,363
the arc of this case
is a tragedy of errors.

2272
01:45:56,432 --> 01:45:59,168
Marta it will not
be easy for you to hear.

2273
01:45:59,701 --> 01:46:02,335
But there is at least

2274
01:46:02,337 --> 01:46:05,372
one truly guilty party
behind it all,

2275
01:46:05,374 --> 01:46:08,542
guilty in the true sense
of acting with malice

2276
01:46:08,544 --> 01:46:12,214
and committing a heinous crime
with selfish intent.

2277
01:46:15,049 --> 01:46:16,283
Trooper Wagner.

2278
01:46:16,285 --> 01:46:17,719
Trooper Wagner?

2279
01:46:19,053 --> 01:46:20,054
No.

2280
01:46:22,224 --> 01:46:24,424
Marta, I'm so sorry.
I told them everything.

2281
01:46:24,426 --> 01:46:26,092
I figured it was up.
I'm sorry.

2282
01:46:26,094 --> 01:46:28,462
Hey. It's all right, Ransom,
I'm glad you did.

2283
01:46:28,464 --> 01:46:31,063
Not exactly
everything though.

2284
01:46:31,065 --> 01:46:33,366
Is this about
what Greatnana told you?

2285
01:46:33,368 --> 01:46:36,336
She saw me that night.
She mistook me for Ransom.

2286
01:46:36,338 --> 01:46:37,404
We'll get to that.

2287
01:46:37,406 --> 01:46:39,439
In the meanwhile,

2288
01:46:39,441 --> 01:46:42,242
Mr. Hugh Ransom Drysdale,

2289
01:46:42,244 --> 01:46:46,047
you might tell us all
why you hired me.

2290
01:46:49,351 --> 01:46:51,418
Why I hired you?

2291
01:46:51,420 --> 01:46:53,620
You're right,
let's back it up...

2292
01:46:53,622 --> 01:46:55,255
To the night of the party.

2293
01:46:55,257 --> 01:46:57,724
<i>Your argument with Harlan.</i>

2294
01:46:57,726 --> 01:46:59,326
What were the overheard words

2295
01:46:59,328 --> 01:47:02,429
by the Nazi child
masturbating in the bathroom?

2296
01:47:02,431 --> 01:47:06,099
<i>"My will," and
"I'm warning you."</i>

2297
01:47:06,101 --> 01:47:08,535
You and Harlan
were drama mamas,

2298
01:47:08,537 --> 01:47:11,571
you shared a love of twisting
the knife into one another.

2299
01:47:11,573 --> 01:47:13,173
You see, I don't believe

2300
01:47:13,175 --> 01:47:14,674
he would have
slipped it in halfway,

2301
01:47:14,676 --> 01:47:15,677
no, no, no.

2302
01:47:16,512 --> 01:47:18,311
I submit

2303
01:47:18,313 --> 01:47:20,814
Harlan told you everything.

2304
01:47:20,816 --> 01:47:22,282
You can't be serious!

2305
01:47:22,284 --> 01:47:25,685
Not a red dime
or word of my work

2306
01:47:25,687 --> 01:47:28,223
to a single one of them,
you included.

2307
01:47:28,557 --> 01:47:30,090
Marta,

2308
01:47:30,092 --> 01:47:31,491
remind me what Ransom said

2309
01:47:31,493 --> 01:47:34,628
his conversation
with Harlan ended with?

2310
01:47:34,630 --> 01:47:37,230
Harlan told him that
I could beat him at Go.

2311
01:47:37,232 --> 01:47:39,132
And I asked myself,

2312
01:47:39,134 --> 01:47:40,300
"Marta?

2313
01:47:40,302 --> 01:47:42,335
"Why would the topic of the will

2314
01:47:42,337 --> 01:47:44,740
"have steered around
to Marta?"

2315
01:47:45,874 --> 01:47:49,276
There is one
obvious explanation...

2316
01:47:49,278 --> 01:47:50,310
You can't be that crazy.

2317
01:47:50,312 --> 01:47:52,312
You're not just gonna
throw away your fortune.

2318
01:47:52,314 --> 01:47:54,347
No. I'm giving it to Marta.

2319
01:47:54,349 --> 01:47:55,649
All of it.

2320
01:47:56,752 --> 01:47:58,184
Your Brazilian nurse?

2321
01:47:58,186 --> 01:47:59,519
Are you goddamn insane?

2322
01:47:59,521 --> 01:48:02,622
I'm sane for the first time
in my life,

2323
01:48:02,624 --> 01:48:03,690
- and I've done it.
- Harlan, if you think

2324
01:48:03,692 --> 01:48:04,624
I'm gonna let this happen,

2325
01:48:04,626 --> 01:48:05,525
if you think I'm gonna
stand here and...

2326
01:48:05,527 --> 01:48:07,661
I've made the change
to my will. It's done.

2327
01:48:07,663 --> 01:48:08,664
I'm warning you!

2328
01:48:09,898 --> 01:48:11,733
That's some
heavy-duty conjecture.

2329
01:48:12,367 --> 01:48:13,800
Granted.

2330
01:48:13,802 --> 01:48:17,671
But it is the only way
what comes next makes sense.

2331
01:48:17,673 --> 01:48:20,542
So you storm out,
you drive off into the night.

2332
01:48:21,877 --> 01:48:23,577
<i>You tell Marta later...</i>

2333
01:48:23,579 --> 01:48:26,248
What was it?
Feeling an overwhelming sense of...

2334
01:48:26,615 --> 01:48:28,348
Clarity.

2335
01:48:28,350 --> 01:48:31,219
That he had to make do
for himself from here on out.

2336
01:48:31,553 --> 01:48:32,619
Exactly.

2337
01:48:35,557 --> 01:48:38,525
<i>Marta. The will. Harlan.</i>

2338
01:48:38,527 --> 01:48:40,226
<i>"Do for yourself."</i>

2339
01:48:40,228 --> 01:48:42,164
<i>"You won't get away with this."</i>

2340
01:48:42,698 --> 01:48:44,700
<i>And a plan forms.</i>

2341
01:48:53,375 --> 01:48:54,674
<i>You return,</i>

2342
01:48:54,676 --> 01:48:57,744
<i>careful to avoid the gate's
security camera range.</i>

2343
01:48:57,746 --> 01:49:00,313
<i>Then on foot up
towards the house,</i>

2344
01:49:00,315 --> 01:49:02,248
<i>you sneak in up the trellis,</i>

2345
01:49:02,250 --> 01:49:04,651
<i>so as not to be seen
by the rest of the family</i>

2346
01:49:04,653 --> 01:49:07,489
<i>who are still having
their party downstairs.</i>

2347
01:49:08,924 --> 01:49:12,959
<i>What you need to do
will take moments.</i>

2348
01:49:12,961 --> 01:49:17,497
<i>But it is essential that you
are alone and undetected.</i>

2349
01:49:17,499 --> 01:49:20,200
<i>You knew what
medications Harlan took.</i>

2350
01:49:20,202 --> 01:49:22,904
<i>You knew what Marta would be
injecting him with that night.</i>

2351
01:49:23,872 --> 01:49:24,873
<i>And you knew</i>

2352
01:49:25,907 --> 01:49:29,676
if Marta was responsible
for his death,

2353
01:49:29,678 --> 01:49:32,545
<i>even unintentionally,</i>

2354
01:49:32,547 --> 01:49:35,582
the slayer rule would nullify
the changed will

2355
01:49:35,584 --> 01:49:38,718
and you would
get your share back.

2356
01:49:38,720 --> 01:49:40,520
<i>You used
the syringes in the kit</i>

2357
01:49:40,522 --> 01:49:43,525
<i>to switch the liquids
in the two medication vials.</i>

2358
01:49:44,526 --> 01:49:45,827
And as a final precaution...

2359
01:49:47,829 --> 01:49:49,765
<i>you took the Naloxone,</i>

2360
01:49:50,565 --> 01:49:53,667
the lifesaving antidote.

2361
01:49:53,669 --> 01:49:56,002
<i>No. No, no, no,
that's impossible.</i>

2362
01:49:56,004 --> 01:49:57,804
That is the truth.

2363
01:49:57,806 --> 01:50:00,407
Hand me that vial of morphine,
I'll show you.

2364
01:50:00,409 --> 01:50:03,410
If he did that,
if the meds were switched,

2365
01:50:03,412 --> 01:50:05,747
then when I got them
mixed up, I...

2366
01:50:07,382 --> 01:50:09,484
I accidentally
switched them back,

2367
01:50:10,819 --> 01:50:12,018
so I gave Harlan...

2368
01:50:12,020 --> 01:50:13,422
The correct doses.

2369
01:50:13,989 --> 01:50:15,357
Yes.

2370
01:50:17,793 --> 01:50:19,327
But not accidentally.

2371
01:50:20,862 --> 01:50:23,932
I taped over the label
of these two vials.

2372
01:50:25,267 --> 01:50:27,903
The vials themselves
are identical.

2373
01:50:30,639 --> 01:50:33,306
How'd you know
this was the morphine?

2374
01:50:33,308 --> 01:50:34,708
I just knew.

2375
01:50:34,710 --> 01:50:36,676
You knew because
there is the slightest,

2376
01:50:36,678 --> 01:50:37,777
almost imperceptible
differences

2377
01:50:37,779 --> 01:50:40,415
of tincture and viscosity
between the two liquids.

2378
01:50:42,484 --> 01:50:45,754
You knew because you've
done it a hundred times.

2379
01:50:47,355 --> 01:50:49,622
You gave him
the correct medication

2380
01:50:49,624 --> 01:50:51,993
because you are a good nurse.

2381
01:50:53,428 --> 01:50:54,661
Then Harlan was...

2382
01:50:54,663 --> 01:50:56,665
I'm sorry, Marta. But yes.

2383
01:50:58,033 --> 01:51:00,235
- Harlan was perfectly fine.
- Oh, my God.

2384
01:51:01,336 --> 01:51:03,603
His blood was normal.

2385
01:51:03,605 --> 01:51:07,407
The cause of death was truly,
solely suicide,

2386
01:51:07,409 --> 01:51:08,975
and you are guilty

2387
01:51:08,977 --> 01:51:10,977
of nothing but some damage
to the trellis

2388
01:51:10,979 --> 01:51:13,480
and a few amateur theatrics.

2389
01:51:13,482 --> 01:51:15,915
In fact,
if Harlan had listened to you

2390
01:51:15,917 --> 01:51:17,786
and called the ambulance,

2391
01:51:19,621 --> 01:51:20,856
he would be alive today.

2392
01:51:24,893 --> 01:51:25,959
Damn!

2393
01:51:25,961 --> 01:51:27,529
A twisted web

2394
01:51:28,864 --> 01:51:31,030
and we are not finished
untangling it.

2395
01:51:31,032 --> 01:51:32,866
Not yet.

2396
01:51:32,868 --> 01:51:35,034
Marta, when Greatnana
spotted you

2397
01:51:35,036 --> 01:51:36,905
climbing down
the trellis, she said...

2398
01:51:38,440 --> 01:51:42,109
Ransom?
Are you back again already?

2399
01:51:42,111 --> 01:51:45,044
<i>"Are you back
again already?"</i>

2400
01:51:45,046 --> 01:51:46,515
'Cause earlier that night...

2401
01:51:49,651 --> 01:51:52,020
Ransom, you're back?

2402
01:51:53,555 --> 01:51:55,688
Come on, Marta.

2403
01:51:55,690 --> 01:51:57,991
This is stoopid with two o's.

2404
01:51:57,993 --> 01:51:59,459
You don't have
a shred of evidence,

2405
01:51:59,461 --> 01:52:01,060
you're just
spinning a fairy tale.

2406
01:52:01,062 --> 01:52:02,762
Not a shred, no.

2407
01:52:02,764 --> 01:52:05,865
Just as we have no real proof
of Marta mixing up the vials,

2408
01:52:05,867 --> 01:52:07,033
so it's your word...

2409
01:52:07,035 --> 01:52:08,436
You have her confession!

2410
01:52:11,039 --> 01:52:12,541
All right, yeah.

2411
01:52:13,408 --> 01:52:14,808
Yeah, we do have that.

2412
01:52:14,810 --> 01:52:15,875
With your permission,

2413
01:52:15,877 --> 01:52:17,644
I'd like to spin
a little further.

2414
01:52:17,646 --> 01:52:19,079
<i>Much later that night,</i>

2415
01:52:19,081 --> 01:52:21,081
<i>you'd have to come back
to the house...</i>

2416
01:52:21,083 --> 01:52:23,449
<i>to retrieve the incriminating
tampered vials.</i>

2417
01:52:23,451 --> 01:52:26,619
<i>However, this time
the dogs were outside.</i>

2418
01:52:29,057 --> 01:52:31,391
<i>They barked,
waking Meg.</i>

2419
01:52:31,393 --> 01:52:32,559
<i>No matter.</i>

2420
01:52:32,561 --> 01:52:34,527
<i>You'll get the vials tomorrow.</i>

2421
01:52:34,529 --> 01:52:36,163
But tomorrow brings news...

2422
01:52:36,165 --> 01:52:38,998
Not of a medical error
and a guilty nurse,

2423
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,403
but of a slit throat
and a suicide.

2424
01:52:46,142 --> 01:52:48,775
<i>Now the circumstances
are perfect</i>

2425
01:52:48,777 --> 01:52:51,444
<i>for the anonymous hirin' of me.</i>

2426
01:52:51,446 --> 01:52:53,880
<i>You know a crime has been
committed by Miss Cabrera,</i>

2427
01:52:53,882 --> 01:52:55,648
<i>you need her
to be caught for it.</i>

2428
01:52:55,650 --> 01:52:58,120
You cannot reveal
how you know.

2429
01:52:59,921 --> 01:53:01,155
Enter...

2430
01:53:01,157 --> 01:53:02,856
Benoit Blanc.

2431
01:53:02,858 --> 01:53:04,424
Benny, look...

2432
01:53:04,426 --> 01:53:05,558
I hear what you're saying,
but this...

2433
01:53:06,528 --> 01:53:08,728
The body is discovered early
the next morning.

2434
01:53:08,730 --> 01:53:09,762
<i>The police,</i>

2435
01:53:09,764 --> 01:53:11,431
<i>the medical examiner,
the family,</i>

2436
01:53:11,433 --> 01:53:13,600
everyone swarms in

2437
01:53:13,602 --> 01:53:15,468
and there is no possible way

2438
01:53:15,470 --> 01:53:17,070
you can get to
Marta's medical bag

2439
01:53:17,072 --> 01:53:18,538
to retrieve the vials.

2440
01:53:18,540 --> 01:53:20,006
You must wait
for your moment,

2441
01:53:20,008 --> 01:53:21,908
when the investigation
is over

2442
01:53:21,910 --> 01:53:25,145
and you know
the house will be empty.

2443
01:53:25,147 --> 01:53:27,480
And that is why

2444
01:53:27,482 --> 01:53:28,884
you missed the funeral.

2445
01:53:30,119 --> 01:53:31,818
<i>There is no one home to wonder</i>

2446
01:53:31,820 --> 01:53:33,955
<i>why you're going
into Harlan's study.</i>

2447
01:53:35,091 --> 01:53:36,956
<i>Or so you think.</i>

2448
01:53:39,961 --> 01:53:41,494
<i>Poor Fran.</i>

2449
01:53:41,496 --> 01:53:42,695
<i>She witnessed you tampering</i>

2450
01:53:42,697 --> 01:53:45,531
<i>with Harlan's medication
in the medical bag.</i>

2451
01:53:45,533 --> 01:53:49,169
<i>She did not know
what you were doing.</i>

2452
01:53:49,171 --> 01:53:51,804
<i>But she knew
you were up to no good.</i>

2453
01:53:51,806 --> 01:53:53,806
<i>So her mind begins to turn.</i>

2454
01:53:53,808 --> 01:53:55,608
<i>Oh, God.</i>

2455
01:53:55,610 --> 01:53:57,543
That Hallmark movie
she told me about,

2456
01:53:57,545 --> 01:53:58,878
with Danica McKellar...

2457
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:00,080
<i>Deadly by Surprise.</i>

2458
01:54:00,082 --> 01:54:01,681
That's what
she was talking about.

2459
01:54:01,683 --> 01:54:02,884
She loved Harlan.

2460
01:54:03,585 --> 01:54:05,252
She hates Ransom.

2461
01:54:05,254 --> 01:54:07,720
So the poor girl decides
to test her theory,

2462
01:54:07,722 --> 01:54:09,555
and make this asshole pay.

2463
01:54:09,557 --> 01:54:12,592
She gets a copy
of the toxicology report.

2464
01:54:12,594 --> 01:54:15,995
Now, I will be honest,
I have no idea how.

2465
01:54:15,997 --> 01:54:17,597
'Cause she has a cousin.

2466
01:54:17,599 --> 01:54:19,099
She told me,
she has a cousin

2467
01:54:19,101 --> 01:54:21,768
who works as a receptionist
at the examiner's office.

2468
01:54:21,770 --> 01:54:23,036
Well, <i>voila!</i>

2469
01:54:23,038 --> 01:54:26,005
The numbers,
they mean nothing to her,

2470
01:54:26,007 --> 01:54:29,809
but if Ransom is guilty,
its existence is a threat

2471
01:54:29,811 --> 01:54:32,814
so she photocopies the header
and makes her blackmail note.

2472
01:54:33,815 --> 01:54:35,515
So why did she send it to me?

2473
01:54:35,517 --> 01:54:37,050
She didn't.

2474
01:54:37,052 --> 01:54:38,820
She sent it to Ransom.

2475
01:54:43,959 --> 01:54:46,193
<i>And when Mr. Drysdale gets it,</i>

2476
01:54:46,195 --> 01:54:47,762
<i>what is his reaction?</i>

2477
01:54:48,530 --> 01:54:49,562
Elation.

2478
01:54:49,564 --> 01:54:52,166
<i>He still thinks Marta
has given Harlan</i>

2479
01:54:52,168 --> 01:54:53,233
<i>the tampered drugs.</i>

2480
01:54:53,235 --> 01:54:56,203
<i>A blood tox report
will prove her guilt.</i>

2481
01:54:56,205 --> 01:54:58,638
<i>He goes to the will reading
in high spirits,</i>

2482
01:54:58,640 --> 01:55:01,541
ready to see the family
tear itself apart,

2483
01:55:01,543 --> 01:55:03,710
secure in the knowledge
it will be all undone

2484
01:55:03,712 --> 01:55:06,514
when the tox report
comes to light.

2485
01:55:07,716 --> 01:55:09,116
And then...

2486
01:55:10,186 --> 01:55:12,652
<i>Marta's confession.</i>

2487
01:55:12,654 --> 01:55:15,222
<i>And everything
turns on its head.</i>

2488
01:55:15,224 --> 01:55:19,592
<i>He now realizes that Marta
has committed no crime</i>

2489
01:55:19,594 --> 01:55:23,663
<i>and the tox report
will prove her innocence.</i>

2490
01:55:23,665 --> 01:55:25,600
<i>The changed will
is gonna stand.</i>

2491
01:55:26,001 --> 01:55:27,834
<i>He has lost.</i>

2492
01:55:29,637 --> 01:55:30,705
<i>Unless...</i>

2493
01:55:31,740 --> 01:55:33,573
Unless you decide...

2494
01:55:33,575 --> 01:55:34,807
You're not gonna give up
the money.

2495
01:55:34,809 --> 01:55:36,843
You're not gonna give up
the money.

2496
01:55:36,845 --> 01:55:37,977
You've come this far.

2497
01:55:37,979 --> 01:55:39,581
You've come this far.

2498
01:55:40,249 --> 01:55:42,251
Just one step further,

2499
01:55:42,917 --> 01:55:45,752
just one last act.

2500
01:55:45,754 --> 01:55:47,956
In for a penny, in for a pound.

2501
01:55:50,625 --> 01:55:52,560
You decide you are in.

2502
01:55:57,299 --> 01:55:58,765
<i>Step one...</i>

2503
01:55:59,868 --> 01:56:02,871
<i>Destroy all evidence
of Marta's innocence.</i>

2504
01:56:09,245 --> 01:56:10,710
<i>Step two,</i>

2505
01:56:10,712 --> 01:56:13,012
<i>send her the anonymous email</i>

2506
01:56:13,014 --> 01:56:15,617
<i>with a late morning
rendezvous time...</i>

2507
01:56:18,987 --> 01:56:22,057
<i>And deliver her
the blackmail note.</i>

2508
01:56:24,659 --> 01:56:26,393
<i>Step three,</i>

2509
01:56:26,395 --> 01:56:28,963
<i>keep your
appointment with Fran.</i>

2510
01:56:30,665 --> 01:56:32,698
Oh, I knew it.

2511
01:56:32,700 --> 01:56:35,369
I knew you were a no-good
son of a bitch.

2512
01:56:35,371 --> 01:56:37,870
I knew Harlan wouldn't
just kill himself.

2513
01:56:37,872 --> 01:56:39,672
Yes, Fran,
you were right.

2514
01:56:39,674 --> 01:56:41,974
I knew you were
guilty as shit.

2515
01:56:41,976 --> 01:56:44,311
And now
you're gonna pay for it!

2516
01:56:44,313 --> 01:56:45,945
Don't you come near me.

2517
01:56:45,947 --> 01:56:48,648
Don't come near me!
I'm warning you!

2518
01:56:57,959 --> 01:57:00,360
<i>See, now,
now the board is set.</i>

2519
01:57:00,362 --> 01:57:02,229
<i>Marta will get
the blackmail note.</i>

2520
01:57:02,231 --> 01:57:04,264
<i>You'll put the pieces
together for her.</i>

2521
01:57:04,266 --> 01:57:06,200
<i>You'll guide her
to the rendezvous.</i>

2522
01:57:06,202 --> 01:57:08,368
<i>You'll make the anonymous call
to the police,</i>

2523
01:57:08,370 --> 01:57:09,470
<i>they will catch her there</i>

2524
01:57:09,472 --> 01:57:11,438
<i>with the body
and the burned evidence.</i>

2525
01:57:11,440 --> 01:57:14,374
Marta will get arrested
for killing Fran

2526
01:57:14,376 --> 01:57:15,844
and Harlan.

2527
01:57:16,778 --> 01:57:17,910
She said...

2528
01:57:17,912 --> 01:57:19,215
You did this.

2529
01:57:20,715 --> 01:57:22,216
She didn't say...

2530
01:57:22,218 --> 01:57:23,219
"You did this."

2531
01:57:24,686 --> 01:57:26,686
She wasn't talking about me,
she said...

2532
01:57:26,688 --> 01:57:28,921
Hugh did this.

2533
01:57:28,923 --> 01:57:30,823
"Hugh did this."

2534
01:57:30,825 --> 01:57:33,095
'Cause you made the help
call you Hugh.

2535
01:57:34,363 --> 01:57:35,797
'Cause you're an asshole.

2536
01:57:37,166 --> 01:57:39,266
And it would have worked

2537
01:57:39,268 --> 01:57:41,734
if we hadn't have brought you
in for questioning

2538
01:57:41,736 --> 01:57:44,471
<i>so you could not make
your anonymous call.</i>

2539
01:57:44,473 --> 01:57:45,972
<i>And if Fran had not stashed</i>

2540
01:57:45,974 --> 01:57:48,475
a safety copy of the tox report.

2541
01:57:48,477 --> 01:57:52,714
And if Marta had not
outplayed you once again.

2542
01:57:53,715 --> 01:57:55,284
<i>By having a kind heart.</i>

2543
01:57:57,752 --> 01:58:00,187
<i>By saving Fran's life</i>

2544
01:58:00,189 --> 01:58:02,356
<i>though it meant
her losing the inheritance</i>

2545
01:58:02,358 --> 01:58:03,490
<i>and going to jail.</i>

2546
01:58:03,492 --> 01:58:06,493
She didn't play your game.

2547
01:58:06,495 --> 01:58:08,264
She saved Fran's life.

2548
01:58:11,733 --> 01:58:12,734
Fran's alive?

2549
01:58:13,435 --> 01:58:15,034
Oh, yes.

2550
01:58:15,036 --> 01:58:16,769
Fran...

2551
01:58:16,771 --> 01:58:20,340
...who will confirm
this very story

2552
01:58:20,342 --> 01:58:21,709
or something close to it.

2553
01:58:22,911 --> 01:58:26,047
And send you, Hugh,

2554
01:58:26,748 --> 01:58:27,749
to jail.

2555
01:58:32,288 --> 01:58:33,289
Yes?

2556
01:58:37,126 --> 01:58:38,760
Doctor, that's great news.

2557
01:58:39,794 --> 01:58:41,363
We'll be there soon.
Thank you.

2558
01:58:46,135 --> 01:58:47,136
She's okay.

2559
01:58:48,002 --> 01:58:50,002
She's ready to talk.

2560
01:58:50,004 --> 01:58:51,837
Trooper Wagner,
if you could, uh,

2561
01:58:51,839 --> 01:58:53,173
keep Mr. Drysdale in custody

2562
01:58:53,175 --> 01:58:56,176
while Lieutenant Elliott,
Ms. Cabrera and myself,

2563
01:58:56,178 --> 01:58:58,078
we go to the hospital
and take Fran's statement.

2564
01:58:58,080 --> 01:58:59,381
All right.
Up, come on.

2565
01:59:05,820 --> 01:59:07,820
I'm gonna say this
just to you.

2566
01:59:07,822 --> 01:59:09,156
No cameras, no courtroom,

2567
01:59:09,158 --> 01:59:10,892
just you,
'cause you know it's true.

2568
01:59:11,859 --> 01:59:13,826
We allowed you
into our home.

2569
01:59:13,828 --> 01:59:15,262
We let you watch
our granddad,

2570
01:59:15,264 --> 01:59:17,029
we welcomed you
into our family.

2571
01:59:17,031 --> 01:59:19,333
And now you think
you can steal it from us?

2572
01:59:19,335 --> 01:59:22,469
You think I'm not gonna fight
to protect my home,

2573
01:59:22,471 --> 01:59:24,238
our birthright,

2574
01:59:24,240 --> 01:59:27,140
our ancestral family home?

2575
01:59:29,144 --> 01:59:30,577
That is hooey.

2576
01:59:30,579 --> 01:59:32,579
Harlan, he bought
this place in the '80s

2577
01:59:32,581 --> 01:59:34,581
from a Pakistani
real estate billionaire.

2578
01:59:34,583 --> 01:59:36,450
Oh, shut up, Blanc!
Shut up!

2579
01:59:36,452 --> 01:59:40,522
Shut up with that Kentucky
Fried Foghorn Leghorn drawl!

2580
01:59:41,590 --> 01:59:43,856
Yeah, I killed Fran.
But I guess I didn't.

2581
01:59:43,858 --> 01:59:45,425
So what do you have on me?

2582
01:59:45,427 --> 01:59:47,294
Nothing.
What, attempted murder?

2583
01:59:47,296 --> 01:59:49,996
I get arson for the building,
and a few other charges.

2584
01:59:49,998 --> 01:59:52,165
With a good lawyer,
which I have,

2585
01:59:52,167 --> 01:59:53,400
I'll be out in no time.

2586
01:59:53,402 --> 01:59:55,302
And then you'll see
just how much hell

2587
01:59:55,304 --> 01:59:56,969
I can wreak on your life,

2588
01:59:56,971 --> 01:59:59,807
you vicious little bitch.

2589
02:00:07,082 --> 02:00:08,548
What the shit!

2590
02:00:09,618 --> 02:00:11,351
That means
she's lying!

2591
02:00:11,353 --> 02:00:12,918
Yeah, man, we know.

2592
02:00:12,920 --> 02:00:13,921
That's right.

2593
02:00:14,856 --> 02:00:15,857
Fran's dead.

2594
02:00:20,162 --> 02:00:22,331
And you just confessed
to her murder.

2595
02:00:35,043 --> 02:00:36,044
Well...

2596
02:00:37,313 --> 02:00:38,347
In for a penny...

2597
02:01:23,125 --> 02:01:24,126
Shit.

2598
02:02:57,419 --> 02:02:58,420
Linda!

2599
02:02:58,754 --> 02:02:59,853
Linda!

2600
02:02:59,855 --> 02:03:02,424
We've gotta get the attorneys
on the phone right now!

2601
02:03:03,192 --> 02:03:04,193
We...

2602
02:03:10,365 --> 02:03:11,498
<i>Can I ask</i>

2603
02:03:11,500 --> 02:03:13,500
<i>when did you know
I had something to do</i>

2604
02:03:13,502 --> 02:03:15,235
<i>with Harlan's death?</i>

2605
02:03:15,237 --> 02:03:17,237
Oh, from the first moment

2606
02:03:17,239 --> 02:03:18,707
you set foot in front of me.

2607
02:03:24,045 --> 02:03:24,977
Oh, shit.

2608
02:03:24,979 --> 02:03:27,080
I want you
to remember something

2609
02:03:27,082 --> 02:03:28,317
that's very important.

2610
02:03:29,485 --> 02:03:30,684
You won,

2611
02:03:30,686 --> 02:03:33,555
not by playing the game
Harlan's way,

2612
02:03:34,356 --> 02:03:35,424
but yours.

2613
02:03:37,759 --> 02:03:39,161
You're a good person.

2614
02:03:41,363 --> 02:03:42,698
This family.

2615
02:03:49,171 --> 02:03:51,340
I should help them. Right?

2616
02:03:52,207 --> 02:03:54,576
Well, I have my opinion,

2617
02:03:56,211 --> 02:03:58,480
but I have a feeling
you'll follow your heart.
