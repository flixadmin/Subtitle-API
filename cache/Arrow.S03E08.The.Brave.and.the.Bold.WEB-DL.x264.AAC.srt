1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:03,700
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,130
After five years in hell,

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,630
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,370
To save my city.

5
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:10,800
Now others have
joined my crusade.

6
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,670
To them, I am Oliver Queen.

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,380
To the rest
of Starling city,

8
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,340
I am someone else.

9
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,110
I am something else.

10
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,480
Previously,
on "arrow" and "flash"...

11
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,020
Hello?
It's Barry.

12
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,020
I woke up.
I could use some advice.

13
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,990
I don't think that
bolt of lightning
struck you, Barry.

14
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:32,190
I think it chose you.

15
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:34,730
You can inspire people

16
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,330
In a way that
I never could.

17
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,130
So what are you guys doing
in central city?

18
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,500
Working a case.
Suspicious homicide,

19
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,800
In a style where
the murder weapon...

20
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,670
Is a boomerang.

21
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,740
Partners?
Partners.

22
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:52,310
Barry has super
powers, Oliver
has a bow and arrow.

23
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,580
If I had a sample I was unable
to fully break down,

24
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,320
Do you think you could
isolate the genetic
markings for me?

25
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,120
What's the sample from?
Canary's murder.

26
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,670
In position?

27
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,240
In position.

28
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:24,950
In position.

29
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,550
Neighborhood's
clear.

30
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,350
You know, I probably
should have brought
this up before,

31
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,720
But if this place
doesn't belong to the killer

32
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,350
You chased to central city
and back, well,

33
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,620
We're going to have
a lot of explaining to do.

34
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,530
It's his.

35
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,060
Why, because
the residue
s.T.A.R. Labs

36
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,700
Found on the boomerang
says so?

37
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,730
Because the whole
place is rigged.

38
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:52,610
I can see a trip
wire connected
to pressurized gas.

39
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:56,140
Front door
will be the same.

40
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,480
Our new friend doesn't want
any surprise visitors.

41
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:05,850
Well, he's going
to get a surprise.

42
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,150
Looks like
we interrupted his dinner.

43
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,820
We just missed him.

44
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,420
Drop your guns.

45
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,160
Sure thing.
Right when

46
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,590
You learn
how to count.

47
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,760
You're outnumbered,
jerkwad.

48
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,800
You're not scpd.

49
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,700
Unless police
uniforms have gotten

50
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,500
Really interesting,
neither are you.

51
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,040
A.R.G.U.S.

52
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:00,840
Your flanking patterns
haven't changed in years.

53
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,110
Why is a.R.G.U.S.
In on this?

54
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,440
The man who was killed
by the boomerang...

55
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,180
He was an a.R.G.U.S. Agent?

56
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,780
Which makes this
an a.R.G.U.S. Matter.

57
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,250
Bug out.
Target's not here.

58
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,860
Let this go.

59
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,570
Are we going
to let this go?

60
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,630
What do you think?

61
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,680
Oh, well, a.R.G.U.S.
Wiped all evidence
of their agent's death

62
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,980
After he was killed,
or at least they
thought they did.

63
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,920
Our boomerang victim,
kai wu.

64
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,160
The man's profile is so clean,
I should have known it was
an a.R.G.U.S. Cover.

65
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,720
Well, now that we know
wu is a.R.G.U.S.,

66
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,760
If this an a.R.G.U.S. Thing,
Lyla's going to want it
to stay that way.

67
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,900
Then tell her to stop
letting people get
killed in my city.

68
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,500
You really don't care
about my marriage, do you?

69
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,240
Well, I would...

70
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,510
If you and Lyla
were still married.

71
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,750
Thank you
for coming.

72
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,180
Like I had a choice.

73
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,420
I see you made a new friend.

74
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,020
This is katsu cheng.

75
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,520
Mr. Cheng
fancies himself

76
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,020
Something
of a munitions
specialist.

77
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:26,230
Cheng planted
an explosive device
somewhere in Hong Kong,

78
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:29,360
I need you to talk to him,
find out the bomb's location.

79
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,700
So I'm just going
to talk to him

80
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,070
And he's going to
give me information?

81
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,200
It won't be easy.

82
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,610
That's why I brought you
your tools.

83
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,210
What tools?

84
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:44,240
We recovered these
from the freighter

85
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,480
When we recovered you.

86
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,450
You're welcome.

87
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:49,950
You want me
to torture this guy

88
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,250
To find out
where the bomb is?

89
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,650
I want you to find out
where the bomb is.

90
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,960
How you do so
is of little interest to me.

91
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,100
[door opens]

92
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,300
Almost done here,
jerry.

93
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,340
You should have
gone home hours ago.

94
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,310
Caitlin:
Who's jerry?

95
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,510
This place is bigger
than my apartment.

96
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,140
What are you guys
doing here?

97
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,480
You asked us to
analyze the dna
off the arrow

98
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,780
That killed
Sara.

99
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,080
I was just going
to mail you the sample.

100
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,090
We had some vacation
days coming--

101
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,590
We want to see the arrow cave.

102
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:30,660
We don't call it that.

103
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:32,690
Ever.

104
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,960
I want to see
the toys!

105
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,000
I need to see
the toys.

106
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,200
Do you guys have
an arrowmobile?

107
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:47,010
Don't touch that.

108
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,540
Or that.

109
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,650
It's a jettisoning arrow.
Uses compressed co2--

110
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,680
Compressed co2
to jettison
high tensile

111
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,620
Strength
polymer cables.
Yep.

112
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:00,220
Since when did we start
selling admission
the the arrow cave?

113
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,520
It's...

114
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,190
Do you see what you've done?

115
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,130
Incredible.

116
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:11,030
I have so many ideas
for improvements.

117
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,570
And this. Oh, oh, man!

118
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:18,170
And I mean, red is
so much cooler than
green, am I right?

119
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,370
Hmm. I am really starting
to like this guy.

120
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,810
Hey, what's that for?

121
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,850
[sighs]

122
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,480
Distracting me
from work.

123
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,150
So where's Mr. Diggle?

124
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,480
He's running down a lead.

125
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,560
We have this
handled, johnny.

126
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,560
I told Oliver that already.

127
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,890
Seriously.
It's an internal
a.R.G.U.S. Matter.

128
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:41,230
I told him that, too.
Listen, sweetie,

129
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,860
A guy who kills
with boomerangs?

130
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,230
That's a little outside
you guys' wheelhouse.

131
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:48,100
While exotic killers
are more...

132
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,570
Our thing.

133
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:54,240
You only call me
"sweetie" when
you want something.

134
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,080
Is it working?

135
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,930
[beeping]

136
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,860
Hang on a second.

137
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,070
Is there a problem?

138
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,400
Something strange
with your id.

139
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,870
I'm going to have
to detain you
for a minute.

140
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:28,310
If that's a problem,
I really don't care.

141
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,780
You know,

142
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:34,110
You should
how you treat
people, my friend.

143
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,320
After all...

144
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,060
What goes around,
comes around.

145
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:54,570
[beeping]

146
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,740
I appreciate
the offer, johnny,

147
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,240
But really,
we have it handled.

148
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,840
[alarm sounding]

149
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,110
Is that your
"we have it handled" alarm?

150
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,150
[alarm continues]

151
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:20,130
We have a breach.
Initiate lockdown protocols.

152
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,860
[cell phone vibrates]
Diggle.

153
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,530
We have a bit
of a situation here.

154
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:26,500
Our man's
at a.R.G.U.S.
Lyla's here.

155
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,170
Oliver, this guy?
He's the real deal.

156
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:33,440
Our target is
storming a.R.G.U.S.
And Lyla is there.

157
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:37,380
Cisco: Mm-hmm. Bad ass.

158
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,350
So cool!

159
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,280
It'll be over by the time
they get there.

160

161
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:07,570
You only call me
"sweetie" when you
want something.

162
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,680
No, chase, just
because we kiss,

163
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,420
It doesn't mean
anything, ok?

164
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,190
[sirens in distance]

165
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,260
Are you sure
you're ok?

166
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,290
What was that?
A better question--

167
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,460
Who attacked you?

168
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:12,330
And don't tell him
it was an internal
a.R.G.U.S. Matter.

169
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,540
His name is digger harkness.

170
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:20,370
His specialty
is weapons and technology
before he went rogue.

171
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,340
Started selling his services
to the highest bidder.

172
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,180
We caught him three years ago.

173
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,280
Well, looks like
he escaped.

174
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,550
Not exactly.
Harkness' skills

175
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:31,550
Made him an ideal recruit
for task force x.

176
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,150
You mean
the suicide squad.

177
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,520
They had an op in tanzania.

178
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,120
Assassination
of a local warlord.

179
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,160
But the warlord
had bigger guns.

180
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,700
The mission went south...

181
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,360
And the team
had to be sanitized.

182
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,570
You mean killed, Lyla.

183
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:50,770
Waller couldn't be reached.
It was my call.

184
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,340
The micro bomb
in harkness' neck
must have malfunctioned.

185
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:58,010
We need to consider
that every a.R.G.U.S.
Facility is compromised.

186
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:02,720
There's only one place
we can keep you safe.

187
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:07,090
How often does
Oliver do this?

188
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:09,020
Felicity:
At least every Wednesday.

189
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,330
There's a lot of sweating.

190
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:19,730
I don't see what's
so hard about that.

191
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,940
I'm not sure
she should have called you.

192
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,200
Oliver doesn't
play well with others.

193
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:27,540
Ah, come on.
Barry and Oliver
kicked ass last week.

194
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,710
Yeah!

195
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:31,210
They were in, like...
A league of their own.

196
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:33,910
Yeah, that was, like,
a one time thing.

197
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,280
The dude was tossing
around exploding
boomerangs.

198
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,250
They needed
some back-up.

199
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,590
And I need
some dinner.

200
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:42,090
That salmon ladder
made me hungry
for sushi.

201
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:45,590
And I need to get
some paperweights down here!

202
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,590
Caitlin: I should have
warned you about that.

203
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,160
Yeah.

204
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:52,070
Are you ok?

205
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,470
Can't work
for a.R.G.U.S.

206
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,770
Without making
a few enemies.

207
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:58,300
I'm sorry to involve
all of you in this.

208
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:01,110
Is that a.R.G.U.S.
Property?

209
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:04,040
It's evidence.

210
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:08,580
Hey!

211
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,920
Secret identity?

212
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,990
They're married.

213
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,420
Both: We're not married.

214
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,290
Or together.
Whatever.

215
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:18,960
He told her about me.
You didn't?

216
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,660
I keep secrets
for a living, man.

217
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,500
Ah.

218
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,800
My bad.

219
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,930
You're--you're--

220
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,730
The flash. Sushi?

221
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:31,640
We need a location
on the man
who's after Lyla.

222
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,910
His name
is digger harkness.

223
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:34,510
The first step is
to work the evidence--

224
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:38,480
Barry, can I speak
to you for a moment, please?

225
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:45,950
I appreciate
your help back
at a.R.G.U.S.,

226
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,020
But we have
this handled.

227
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,160
You don't want
to team up again?

228
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,460
Things work differently here.

229
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,960
Starling city is meaner.

230
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,990
I seem to remember
helping you pretty
good last year,

231
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,860
And that was
without powers.

232
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,800
I've been practicing

233
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,930
Everything
you taught me.

234
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:59,500
I'm--I'm casing
new environments;

235
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,670
I'm not
running in blind.

236
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,000
[exhales]

237
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,670
We do this my way.

238
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,110
Yes! This is
going to be awesome.

239
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,940
Ok, what's
our first move?

240
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,510
We need to reassemble
the evidence.

241
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:13,910
It will take some time,
but it'll--

242
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:23,890
But it'll be worth it.

243
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:24,990
Rad!

244
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,460
These are a bit more
teched out

245
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,630
Than the one
you guys brought
to central city.

246
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:30,500
3d printed
polymer with
a circuitry weave.

247
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,730
Some of harkness'
boomerangs exploded.

248
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:34,130
Oh, yeah, there are
grooves in here

249
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,700
That could definitely
pack a c4 charge.

250
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,540
Maybe if we figure
out where harkness
got the supplies,

251
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,240
We can use that
to track him.

252
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,310
These weren't made
by ka-boom-boomerang?

253
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:45,710
Yeah, you know, he has
exploding boomerangs?

254
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,650
That's not your best.

255
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,720
Really? It makes
perfect sense--
Cisco.

256
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,490
If harkness didn't make them,
we need to find out who did.

257
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:54,150
And who he made
the buy off of.

258
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,590
Marcos. You see

259
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,590
This collapsible
node design?

260
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:58,560
Dead giveaway.
That's his signature.

261
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,660
We need a location
on this...

262
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:03,400
Klaus marcos.

263
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:07,370
No known home address
or place of employment

264
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,600
For marcos.
But he was arrested

265
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,570
Last year by
an officer quentin lance.

266
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,340
Dad, I absolutely
understand,

267
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,880
But my boss wants answers on
what the department is doing

268
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,850
About the rash of b&es
on the south side.

269
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:21,920
Well, you can tell
'em I got a whole
squad on it,

270
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,950
But it can only
move so fast!

271
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,590
Hey, Laurel,
detective--

272
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,090
Captain. Cap--
captain. Sorry.

273
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,960
Don't worry
about it.
It's been a while.

274
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,120
Is everything ok?

275
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,620
Oh, it's fine.
This is, uh,

276
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:34,560
Ah, Bart Allen,
right? You get hit by
a bus or something?

277
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,530
Barry. It was lightning.

278
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:40,600
Huh. Ow. We worked
together on a case
last year.

279
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,700
Barry's
a friend.
He's in town

280
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,240
With the central
city police
department

281
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,610
And I was hoping
that you could
help with...

282
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,780
He'll explain.

283
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,740
Oliver, can I talk
to you for a moment?

284
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,110
Yeah.

285
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:56,650
The arrow was in central city.

286
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:57,920
This is a follow-up.

287
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,920
Kind of.

288
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,420
I'm looking to
track down a suspect

289
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,720
You apprehended last
year--klaus markos.

290
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,220
You know where
we might be able
to find him?

291
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,490
None of his
last knowns
are checking out.

292
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,100
Well, I don't
really keep up on

293
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,100
On the skels I busted
walking the beat, you know?

294
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,930
I'm not real sentimental
that way.

295
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,130
Ok. Uh,

296
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,670
What did you
arrest him for?

297
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,600
Urmm...

298
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:22,180
He was using some gizmo
to steal credit card numbers

299
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:25,480
For the bratva.
Russian mob.

300
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,010
Ok.

301
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,620
I cannot believe
you're a member
of the Russian mob!

302
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,790
Former member, probably.

303
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,620
We had a falling out last year.

304
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,530
This is where they run
their cyber crime operation.

305
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:40,860
Hey, nice outfit,
by the way.

306
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,530
This place
looks like a fortress.

307
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,030
Kalishnikovs everywhere.

308
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:47,170
Roy, take
the souTheast corner.

309
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:48,800
Barry, scan the perimeter.

310
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,640
Dig--
I've got Northwest.

311
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,440
Are you going to be ok?

312
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,080
You think I'll lose
it because harkness
is after Lyla?

313
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,380
I'm good.

314
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,430
I had eight seconds to kill.

315
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,200
Was that wrong?

316
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,570
What?

317
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:35,250
My friend wants to have
a conversation with you.

00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,980
[groaning
and grunting]

319
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,320
You made this
for digger harkness.

320
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,820
I want to know where he is.

321
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,490
Go to hell.

322
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:45,990
[groaning and grunting]

323
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:50,330
The only thing
that hurts worse
than an arrow going in

324
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:51,760
Is an arrow coming out!

325
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,230
Whoa, hey, what are you doing?!

326
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:55,770
Getting information!
Where is he?!

327
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:56,840
I don't know!

328
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,200
He said he doesn't know!

329
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,210
He's lying. If you want

330
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,770
To be able to raise
your arm again,

331
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,910
Tell me where he is!

332
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:07,350
Here! Harkness
gave it to me.
It's encrypted.

333
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,750
I had an order
ready for him.

334
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,950
I called,
he came.

335
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:13,020
I don't know
where he is,
I swear.

336
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,960
I swear!

337
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,740
Felicity can crack
the encryption.

338
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,780
Use this to track
down harkness.

339
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,910
You tortured that guy.

340
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,820
I interrogated him.

341
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,050
[scoffs]

342
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:47,050
When my friend said
your tactics
made you a criminal,

343
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:50,820
I defended you because
I thought you were
supposed to be a hero.

344
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:54,760
I thought we were
supposed to be
better than them.

345
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,060
Barry...

346
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,930
You live
in central city,

347
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:59,630
Where it's sunny
all the time

348
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:01,830
And your enemies
get cute nicknames.

349
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,840
You're not in
central city.

350
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,940
Yeah.

351
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,740
I live in a city

352
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,070
Where my best friend
was murdered,

353
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,510
Where a woman that
I loved was shot
full of arrows

354
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:12,310
And sent tumbling
off a rooftop.

355
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:14,950
Where my mother
was murdered right
in front of me.

356
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:16,850
So before you--
my mother was murdered

357
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:19,250
In front of me, too.

358
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,420
But I don't use
my personal tragedies

359
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:24,920
As an excuse to just torture
whoever pisses me off.

360
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,330
Well, I'm sorry,
Barry,

361
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:30,000
I'm not as emotionally
healthy as you are.

362
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,860
What's wrong
with you?!

363
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,630
When we agreed
that you were staying,

364
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,940
We decided that
it would be on my terms.

365
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,800
If that is proving
too difficult for you,

366
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:41,070
You know your way
back to central city.

367
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:01,530
Everything
all right between
you and speedy?

368
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:02,860
What? Roy?

369
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,460
Yeah, we're fine.

370
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,870
I meant him.

371
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:06,970
Oh.

372
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:11,900
Difference of opinion
about the way
the world works.

373
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,670
I know what
that's like.

374
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,140
Well, sometimes
they don't see it.

375
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,980
There are people in
the world who deal
only in extremes--

376
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:22,820
And it would be naive
to think that anything
less than extreme measures

377
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,050
Will stop them.

378
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:26,020
Sometimes bravery
isn't enough.

379
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:29,020
Sometimes
the world requires
us to be bold.

380
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,420
Whatever the personal cost.

381
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,760
Felicity: I got him.

382
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,760
He's in a warehouse
at the corner of
infantino and adams.

383
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,730
Is that--
a.R.G.U.S. Spy satellite?

384
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,930
Yeah. Maybe.

385
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,040
Thermographic imaging
shows ten bodies inside.

386
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,670
Harkness knows we're coming.

387
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:47,070
I can track
the cell phone's
position with this.

388
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,010
Cisco, you're
with Diggle and Roy.

389
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,810
I'll race you there.

390
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,720
Where's the bomb?

391
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,290
[speaking Chinese]

392
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:03,860
My Chinese sucks.

393
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,630
But that doesn't
sound like
a location.

394
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:08,930
[grunting]

395
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:14,900
Last chance.

396
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,970
Your hands are shaking.

397
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,040
I knew.

398
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,410
You don't have it in you.

399
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:25,650
You've killed,
but torture is different.

400
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:28,750
For those with a conscience,
inflicting pain

401
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,720
Is more difficult
than inflicting death.

402
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,120
I'll figure it out.
No, you won't.

403
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,290
You don't have
the stomach for it.

404
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:39,030
I do.

405
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:43,960
To save all those
people, I do.

406
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:46,630
Where's the bomb?

407
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:50,140
Where's the bomb?!

408
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:53,070
[explosions]

409
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,860
You ok?

410
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,330
My daughter's
mother tried
to detonate a bomb

411
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:18,160
In a man's head
and now he's
trying to kill her.

412
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,430
So that would be a no.

413
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:21,130
Look, you don't know
me that well.

414
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,800
But I'm the type of guy
who's only thought
about one thing--

415
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:27,010
How do I keep
the people
I love safe?

416
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:29,780
Well, you seem to me
to be pretty good at that.

417
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,880
Maybe before.

418
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,040
I remember a world
where people

419
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:34,550
Didn't kill
each other
with boomerangs.

420
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:36,820
Or walk on water?

421
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,180
Barry can run on water.

422
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,490
You guys, harkness
has been around

423
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:42,150
Long before
people like Barry.

424
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,490
I mean, this world was crazy

425
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:46,730
Before all these meta-humans
and super powers, right?

426
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:48,990
What's--what's your point?

427
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,560
Well, maybe meta-humans

428
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:53,000
And superpowers
were given to us

429
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,030
To deal with the crazy.

430
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,200
You mean by god?

431
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,570
No. By a dark matter wave

432
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:02,040
Released from a failed
particle accelerated reaction.

433
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,680
Either way, I think

434
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:08,080
People like Barry
are the hope

435
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,920
For saving people like us.

436
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,080
People like your wife
and daughter.

437
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,420
She's not his wife.
She's not my wife.

438
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,760
Ok.

439
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,830
Anyway, you see
my point, right?

440
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:22,190
Plus, you got to admit,

441
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,970
It's all pretty
freakin' cool, right?

442
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,180

[men groaning]

444
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,150
You're late.

445
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,790
I knew he was there.

446
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:57,300
He's not dead,
right?

447
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,430
Tranq arrow.

448
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:00,570
Same thing I used
on you in central city.

449
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:02,470
Cisco has the van running.

450
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:04,470
I see you met
harkness' hired muscle.

451
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:06,070
Harkness isn't here.

452
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,640
Hey!

453
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,810
Where's digger harkness?

454
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:11,310
Never met 'em.

455
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:14,850
But he paid us 10 gs
to give you this.

456
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,250
Ten'll get you twenty
this belongs to harkness.

457
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,790
What does that mean?

458
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:23,960
That harkness
played you.

459
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:30,000
[beep]
I swear I turned
that off.

460
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,430
What?
Marko's phone.

461
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:33,170
I shut it down
after I decrypted it.

462
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:35,100
Did someone turn it
back on remotely?

463
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,840
And back trace
the trace?

464
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,470
We have to get
out of here now!

465
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,110
Hello, Lyla.

466
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:49,750
It's been
a long time.

Know what I like most
about boomerangs, Lyla?

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,880
They're proof that things
can come back to haunt you.

You had a bomb in
the back of my head.

I have a little
something special
for the back of yours.

00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:40,370

epinephrine!

479
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,680
That'll work.

480
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,210
Hey, hey, stay with me!

481
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,920
Ok.

482
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,650
Just try and keep her awake.

483
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:02,420
Can you hear me? Lyla?

484
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,190
Lyla! Lyla!

Lyla!
She's not breathing!

486

487
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:22,410

Lyla!

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,410
She's not moving.

490
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:26,750
I've got her
stabilized,

491
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:29,550
But I can't operate
on her here.

492
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:31,620
Barry...

493
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:34,820
Starling general's
at eighth and wilcott.

494
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:52,470
Hkpf ided her
as sumilu kang.

495
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:55,440
She was a student
at the university
of Hong Kong.

496
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,080
A biology textbook
in her backpack.

497
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,310
Apparently she was studying
to become a veterinarian.

498
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,550
He would have told me.
I just needed more time.

499
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:04,420
No, Mr. Queen,
what you needed
was conviction.

500
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,620
And the men who
do things like
this have it.

501
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,620
Tonight you didn't.

502
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,760
I thought I could--
you thought what?

503
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,620
You could
reason with him?

504
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,790
Look around you,
Mr. Queen.

505
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:16,430
Look around
and tell me
that the men

506
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:19,600
Who do this
type of thing
understand reason.

507
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,970
There are people
in this world

508
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:23,670
Who deal only
in extremes.

509
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:26,770
It's naive to think
that anything less

510
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,670
Than extreme
measures
will stop it.

511
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,140
The bomber
was katsu cheng.

512
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,340
But make no
mistake...

513
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,180
This blood
is on your hands.

514
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:37,150
Cheng said I didn't have
the stomach for torture.

515
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:38,350
He was right!

516
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:41,290
Because you need
to practice.

517
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:43,990
Torture
is an art form.

518
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:46,460
It's a skill
one must cultivate.

519
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:49,260
How do I do that?
I think cheng was wrong.

520
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:52,360
I think you not only
have the stomach
for this work;

521
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,700
You have the talent.

Being here,
it feels wrong.

Oliver needed to be alone.
He made that pretty clear.

Three doubles,

You guys ok?

529
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:16,020
We're just having
a tough night.

530
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,120
Anything I can do
to help?

00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:19,790
No. We're--we're good.

00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:22,560
But thanks for the night off.

533
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:28,730
Yo, who was that hottie?

534
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,340
My ex-girlfriend.
Oliver's sister.

She's in surgery.
Mr. Diggle is with her.

537
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:39,140
She going to be ok?
I hope so.

538
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:43,520
How do you guys do it?
How do you guys live like this?

539
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,550
Where anyone you care about
could be struck down?

540
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:52,490
It's all been a game.
We give the bad guys
code names.

541
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:55,160
I think the fact we go
up against meta-humans

542
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,360
Made it all
kind of clean.

543
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,060
Like, the fact that
they've got these powers

544
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:02,530
Makes what
they're doing less...

545
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,470
Real.

546
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:15,710
This is all my fault.

547
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,580
It's really not.

548
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:23,460
I tortured marcos
to give up that phone.

549
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:28,730
None of this would
have happened
if it wasn't for me.

550
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:31,700
I get the feeling you don't
say that very often.

551
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:36,540
To do what I do, Barry,
it takes...Conviction.

552
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,770
But...

553
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:40,870
More often than not,

554
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,540
It's the will
to do what's ugly.

555
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,810
Every time I do
that, I'm...

556
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,480
I'm trading away
little...

557
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:53,620
Pieces of myself.

558
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:57,760
So...You asked
what's wrong with me,

559
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,630
That's--
that's what's wrong,

560
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:04,260
Because the part
that I'm trading away

561
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:07,400
Is Oliver Queen.

562

And lately I've been
feeling like there is...

563

Nothing left
except the arrow.

564
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:22,550
I think you're full of crap.

565
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:26,950
Look,

566
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,860
You've convinced yourself

567
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:32,460
That everything
you've been through

568
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,860
Took away your humanity.

569
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,860
But I think it's because
of your humanity

570
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,330
That you made it through.

571
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:39,530
You wouldn't have survived,

to do that?

You hurt a friend of mine.

583
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:40,530
You really think
there's anywhere

584
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:43,660
In the world
you could run where
we won't find you?

585
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,600
Hmm, probably not.

586
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,470
Which is why I have
a contingency in place.

587

Five bombs planted
throughout Starling.

Now, you can stop me,

589
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:00,380
Or you can stop
the bombs.

590
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:04,780
But you can't do both.

591
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:15,290
Bombs are armed.
In 90 seconds,

592
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,460
This city
will be on fire.

593
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,670
Go.

594
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:26,710
Guys! Harkness just triggered
five bombs throughout the city.

595
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:27,710
We don't know where.

00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:30,240
To blanket the entire city,
he'd have to use--

Radio
controlled ieds.

598
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:33,750
But if we key into
the detonator's
frequency...

599
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:36,780
We can pinpoint
the location of the bombs.

That's not an option.

00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,830

might be linked.

Ok. You see
the secondary trigger?

00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:32,770
It's not just
a receiver...

615
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:33,840
It's a transmitter.

616
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,040
Barry, if you try
to defuse the bomb,

617
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,810
The secondary trigger's
going to transmit a signal

618
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:39,110
And the rest of the bombs
are going to explode.

619
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:40,980
We're running out of time.

620
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,780
You have to defuse
all the bombs
at the same time.

621
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:46,950
You're thinking of
multiplex. I can't be

622
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:49,860
In five places at once.

623
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,690
But I don't have to be.

You'll inflict pain?

Ah, I can tell
you've done it before,
so let me ask you this--

00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:23,010
Screw you,
captain boomerang.

640
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:33,930
You think
you've accomplished
something here?

641
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:37,930
You think you
not killing me
makes you strong?

642
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:40,230
It just means...

643
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:42,830
You're weak.

644
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,210
It means I have
some humanity left.

645
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:55,180
[groaning]

646
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:00,150
You just couldn't
resist, could you?

647
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:29,180
You only call me
"sweetie" when
you want something.

648
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:32,120
I do.

649
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:40,190
I want you
to marry me.

650
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:44,860
I can't believe
I waited this
long to ask.

651
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:47,470
I need you,
Lyla.

652
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:50,540
Now, forever,
official.

653
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,640
I need you.

654
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:54,970
Will you please
stop talking...

655
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,880
So I can say yes?

656
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:05,380
[both moaning]

657
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,690
Some of the str markers
on the dna sample

658
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:15,060
Have degraded,
but I've got a computer
back at the lab

659
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,730
That I think will
help fill in the gaps.

660
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:18,900
Thank you,
Caitlin.

661
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,500
I'll let you know
as soon as I have
the results.

662
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,370
I'll call this time.

663
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:24,370
Roy: It's cool.

664
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:25,940
You guys are fun.
So are you guys.

665
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:28,410
Well, you could be
if you realized

666
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:30,910
You were working
under a nightclub.

667
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:34,180
Oh, did you guys
take care of business?

668
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:36,180
Digger harkness
is now cell mates

669
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,550
With one
Slade Wilson.

670
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:42,050
We've got a pipeline,
he's got a gorgeous
tropical island.

671
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,220
With landmines.

672
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,890
Caitlin: Hmm?
What?

673
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:47,790
It's a long story.

674
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,200
What's this?

675
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,300
Oliver helped me
put that in while

676
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,900
You guys were
at the hospital.

677
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,940
Wait, this
is for me?

678
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,900
For the next time
you're in town.

679
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,910
There'll be
a next time?

680
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:03,410
I'm still calling the shots.

681
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:05,710
We'll talk about that.
Yes, we will.

682
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:08,610
And then I'll call the shots.

683
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,080
We got a gift
for you, too, Oliver.

684
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,450
Early christmas present.

685
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:15,150
Turns out s.T.A.R. Labs'
industrial fabricator

686
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,490
Was based out
of Starling, so...

687
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:19,090
Polymer kevlar weave.

688
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:22,060
It's 25% lighter
and can carry 15% more gear.

689
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:26,800
I've got designs
I'm working up that
I'm really excited by.

690
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,570
It's, uh,
it's subtle.

691
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:30,500
I wanted
to replace the hood,

692
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:35,140
But, uh, Felicity
said it had
sentimental value.

693
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:39,480
Thank you.
Any time.

694
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,680
You guys headed back?

695
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,110
It's possible

696
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,980
That dr. Wells didn't
sign off on us leaving town.

697
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:47,790
Hey, do you still,
like, take the train?

698
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:50,520
Yeah, sure, if I feel
like taking a nap.

699
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:53,290
But Oliver and I have
some unfinished business

700
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:54,430
To take care of first.

701
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:56,030
You guys aren't going

702
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:58,600
To punch each other,
are you?

703
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,140
Why'd you summon me here?

704
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:09,670
No, I summoned you
here to give you
a second chance.

705
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,110
Is this a joke?

706
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:12,810
No.

707
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:15,050
This is
li khuan hui.

708
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:17,380
That name
should sound
familiar to you.

709
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,950
You work for china white.

710
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:21,650
Chien na wei.
Yes, Mr. Hui
is on her payroll.

711
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,020
He's Chinese triad,

712
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:25,990
And he knows
her agenda
here in Hong Kong.

713
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:27,330
Fortunately for you,
Mr. Hui has been

714
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:29,990
Less than
forthcoming
with the details.

715
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,160
Fortunately?

716
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:36,270
You get a stab
at redemption.

717
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,660
Barry: You could have invited
everybody, they'd like this.

718
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:00,660
Oliver: Well,
no, they would
love this,

719
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,430
But this is just
for the two of us.

720
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:05,060
You mean, the one of you.
This was your idea.

721
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:07,000
You can't expect me
to believe

722
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,600
That you don't
want to know,
once and for all,

723
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,240
Who would win--

724
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,270
Me or you.

725
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:14,070
You mean if you don't
shoot me in the back.

726
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:15,440
You got to get
over that, Barry.

727
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,210
Ok, I have super powers.

728
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:19,040
You have arrows that run out.

729
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:21,380
I have strategy
and tactical awareness.

730
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:24,080
When I'm fighting you,
it's literally like
you're standing still.

731
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:27,690
[chuckles]
that's tough talk,
you ready to back it up?

732
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:28,590
Oh, yeah.

733
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:30,790
Hey, by the way...

734
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:32,220
Yeah?

735
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:34,190
You were wrong.

736
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:36,030
When you told me
I could inspire people,

737
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:37,100
You said you couldn't.

738
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:40,130
But you were wrong--
you can inspire.

739
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:43,940
Not as the arrow,
that guy's a douche.

740
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,570
[laughs]

741
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:48,010
But as Oliver Queen.

742
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,410
Thank you.

743
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:52,110
Since we're sharing,

744
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:54,580
You were wrong, too.

745
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,110
When?
Right now.

746
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,720
Because you think
you can kick my ass.

747
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,490
All right, well,
if you think
you can kick mine,

748
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:03,660
You better do it fast.

749
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:07,230
I get it, Barry,
I get it. You're fast.

750
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:16,330
Ready...

751
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,800
Set...
