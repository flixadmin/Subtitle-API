1
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:04,043
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:04,338 --> 00:00:06,250
<i>The infected are being killed
all over the city.</i>

3
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:10,632
<i>I'm the one you seek.</i>

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,585
I am Ra's al Ghul.

5
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:15,679
<i>This man is your past...</i>

6
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:17,553
Now, embrace your future.

7
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:26,228
<i>Use the waters, Bruce.</i>

8
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:30,444
<i>You were the one time
I let love weaken me.</i>

9
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:32,898
<i>I want you around as a constant reminder</i>

10
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:35,074
to never make that mistake again.

11
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:40,739
I heard about Alfred.
Is he gonna be okay?

12
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,745
You don't give a damn about Alfred, and
you sure as hell don't care about me.

13
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:44,871
I know you better than that.

14
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:45,998
I thought you did.

15
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:47,920
<i>Jonathan Crane's father
made a toxin</i>

16
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:49,872
<i>from the adrenal glands of his victims</i>

17
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:51,424
<i>while they experienced terror.</i>

18
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,878
- What do you want?
- I'm tired of just surviving.

19
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,045
I want more.

20
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:01,263
I'm sorry, Alfred.

21
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:03,640
I've been trying to find
who I am for so long.

22
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:05,225
<i>Who am I supposed to be?</i>

23
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,476
Money! Now!

24
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:12,649
<i>You need to find your true north</i>

25
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,023
<i>and let that guide you.</i>

26
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:49,765
Money! Now!

27
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,737
Hurry up. All of it! Give me the ring.

28
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:06,206
You have one chance. Walk away.

29
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:10,536
Who's this?

30
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:25,343
License. I got a license.

31
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,942
<i>Never gonna give you up</i>

32
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,815
<i>Never gonna let you down</i>

33
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,614
<i>Never gonna run around and
desert you</i>

34
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,025
<i>Never gonna make you cry</i>

35
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,658
<i>Never gonna say goodbye</i>

36
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,330
Nobody move!

37
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,719
Jewelry, watches, wallets!

38
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:43,596
You know the drill. Let's go.

39
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:46,095
- We want it all.
- Let's go.

40
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,718
- Hey, you.
- Come on. Nice. Thank you.

41
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:50,636
Ah.

42
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,267
- Jackpot.
- Let me see that.

43
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:53,973
All the money.

44
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:56,813
Cheapskate, huh?

45
00:03:58,613 --> 00:03:59,603
Come on.

46
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,404
Excuse me.

47
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:04,108
Hi.

48
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:20,670
That's Victor Zsasz.

49
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,209
I know who it is.

50
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:24,754
What do you want?

51
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,758
Oh, I was just passing by,
heard the ruckus.

52
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,557
You know you can't
commit a crime in Gotham now

53
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,604
without a license from Penguin, right?

54
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,606
Is that right?

55
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,813
Well, we just started it
so word's still getting out.

56
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:45,317
We ain't kicking half our take
to that little creep.

57
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:50,655
Well, that's a problem.

58
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:54,167
Maybe you ain't noticed,
but there's, uh, four of us

59
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:55,789
and only one of you.

60
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:58,205
My finger!

61
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:04,627
No license, no crime.

62
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:09,428
Now, drop the loot, and blow.

63
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:14,680
You tell Penguin
he hasn't heard the last of this.

64
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,435
And stay out.

65
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:20,897
I can't thank you enough.

66
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:23,688
Don't bother because,
you see, those guys...

67
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,274
They do have a license.

68
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:27,862
<i>Mazel tov.</i>

69
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:31,654
Seriously?

70
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,000
Best wedding ever.

71
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,882
You know, we appreciate all you've done.

72
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:49,255
Do you?

73
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:53,434
Three months ago,
following the Tetch incident,

74
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,561
this city was in flames.

75
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:59,228
I came to you and offered
to cut crime in half,

76
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:01,024
and I delivered.

77
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,983
Violent crime is down 57%.

78
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:10,611
But now you want to, uh, literally
unionize crime.

79
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,696
- But we can't possibly...
- Quiet!

80
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:25,458
I remember when I sat there
in the mayor's chair.

81
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,256
I do not envy you.

82
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,298
Nor you.

83
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:35,183
Commissioner of Police
in a city notorious for crime.

84
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,011
That's why I wanna help.

85
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:38,638
But...

86
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:42,438
We are fully aware of all you've done.

87
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:43,859
Are you?

88
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:48,648
What do you think really happened
to those hordes of criminals

89
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,404
who once prowled our streets?

90
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,450
- I'll tell you. I hunted them down...
- No, no, no...

91
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,574
I made Gotham safe.

92
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:56,822
Me.

93
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:03,587
But this is Gotham City,
there will always be crime.

94
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,839
What I'm offering is crime
in the hands of professionals

95
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,633
and held to agreed-upon terms...

96
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:13,931
From which you'll profit.

97
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,010
God bless America.

98
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:19,849
You have a choice.

99
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:24,396
An era of calm, prosperity,

100
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,774
or a return to the good old days.

101
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:29,939
And they will return

102
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:31,857
with a vengeance.

103
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,737
We deny everything to the press.

104
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:37,196
Mmm.

105
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:40,867
What you need to worry about
is the GCPD.

106
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:45,087
When one of your officers
finds someone committing a crime,

107
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:50,217
if that person has a license,
they walk away.

108
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,722
Three percent each, uh, from the take.

109
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,424
Two to split between you.

110
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:57,508
- Two and a half.
- One!

111
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:00,011
- You...
- Yes, fine. Done.

112
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,137
Excellent.

113
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,183
Well, if you'll excuse me,

114
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:07,359
I have to go prepare
for the grand opening

115
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,937
of my new club, the Iceberg Lounge.

116
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,313
Good luck.

117
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:14,237
Smile, gentlemen, it's a new day.

118
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,254
- Hi, Frank.
- Good morning, Jim.

119
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:33,503
I'll get your coffee in a second.

120
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,504
Sure.

121
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,015
- Mornin'.
- Good morning.

122
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:43,771
Everything okay, Frank?

123
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,431
Everything's fine, copper.

124
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:46,724
I got a license.

125
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:49,143
Penguin-approved.

126
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:54,107
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

127
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,951
I'll take that coffee to go.

128
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:09,413
Come on, man.

129
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,632
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

130
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,800
I got... I got a license!

131
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,503
Yeah, and unless you shut up,

132
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,347
you're also gonna get a fat lip.

133
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:26,305
We got a problem?

134
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,482
<i>Penguin guarantees
these numbers?</i>

135
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:35,318
<i>Mr. Cobblepot has negotiated them</i>

136
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,070
with the Mayor and Commissioner.

137
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:38,443
These are damn good numbers.

138
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,031
But I already heard
from the Commissioner.

139
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,953
We have to play ball.
What the hell are you doing here?

140
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,249
Compliance with the licenses is key.

141
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:48,456
Mr. Cobblepot worries
about Detective Gordon.

142
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,830
- He has a history.
- My men

143
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,415
will honor the licenses.

144
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,634
You let me worry about Gordon.
Now get the hell out of my office.

145
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,850
- Who was that?
- A, uh, dung beetle.

146
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,264
What's up?

147
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,731
I pulled this off of some guy

148
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:14,278
robbing my corner bar.

149
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,022
You're a homicide detective.

150
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:18,858
Isn't a stick-up a little JV?

151
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,322
I'm a cop. I see a crime, I stop it.

152
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,370
This is the second one of these
I've come across,

153
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,493
- and I'm not the only one.
- Yeah.

154
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:27,658
Harvey.

155
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,252
Harvey, we cannot let this slide.

156
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,418
Word's come down from the Commissioner,

157
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,464
you find someone with one of those,
they walk.

158
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,090
And before you get on your high horse,

159
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,547
three months ago,
this city was in a tailspin.

160
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,930
We survived because Penguin
took control of the underworld.

161
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,643
I'm not giving this city over
to Penguin.

162
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:47,765
I don't care what the Commissioner says.

163
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:49,055
What about your fellow cops, huh?

164
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,061
The past month, how many have been shot?
None.

165
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,141
I know the stats.

166
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,936
Jim, we will bust Penguin one day,
I promise you.

167
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,439
But this city has to get back
on her feet, please?

168
00:10:58,783 --> 00:10:59,773
Harvey, I get that,

169
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,240
but every day the citizens
of Gotham look to Penguin

170
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,241
and not the GCPD to keep them safe,

171
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,997
the harder it's gonna be
to win them back.

172
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,665
You want people to trust cops,

173
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:12,669
there are better ways of doing it
than spitting in Penguin's eyes.

174
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,667
You see one of these,

175
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:16,456
you walk.

176
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:32,598
Bloody Penguin.

177
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:35,271
There must be some way
we can turn this against him.

178
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:38,570
Just stop. Stop, right there.

179
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,773
How does this fit into what we're doing?

180
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:45,198
What was the initial reason
that you popped on that mask,

181
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:46,278
and you went out there?

182
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,448
We agreed that I have to be ready
for when Ra's al Ghul returns.

183
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,788
You yourself said there's no substitute
for real world encounters.

184
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:56,043
But my point is, if that is our mission,
we must hold to it.

185
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,880
My finger was on the button
that released the virus.

186
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,258
- Oh, I see.
- I know I didn't press it,

187
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:05,806
but I feel responsible
for what happened.

188
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,518
And more than that, I can make
a difference in Gotham, Alfred.

189
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,553
- I know I can.
- And that is what we call

190
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:13,810
"mission creep," Master Bruce.

191
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:17,439
You're trying to achieve not one
but two objectives.

192
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,276
So, go on then,
which one is your priority?

193
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,238
It's messy, sir.

194
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,404
It's dangerous.

195
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,573
I hear you, Alfred,

196
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:37,171
but I can prepare myself for Ra's,
and make Gotham safer.

197
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:41,041
You have to trust me.

198
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:52,227
<i>All inmates, this is your last call.</i>

199
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,805
<i>In five minutes, be sure
to make your way to your door.</i>

200
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,437
This way.

201
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,277
Hey, Warden Reed.

202
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,321
Warden Reed's the boss here.

203
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,673
- Where is he?
- This way.

204
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,017
Back when I was an orderly in here,

205
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,563
he'd always talk about his dad,
and this formula he'd made.

206
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:44,571
Some sort of scare juice.
Made you see your greatest fear.

207
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:45,738
When we get a hold of that,

208
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,693
we don't got to worry
about Zsasz or Penguin,

209
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:50,944
or nobody.

210
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,035
What's wrong with him, anyway?

211
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:57,001
The toxin his father injected him with

212
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,707
overloaded Jonathan's fear response.

213
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:03,674
His mind created a sort of
bogeyman figure

214
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,717
and now it haunts him.

215
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:11,804
I find it very useful
for controlling him.

216
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,394
Jonathan, you're going with these men.

217
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:24,695
- What? Wait, where are you taking me?
- Just wanna give someone a little scare.

218
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:25,771
Excellent.

219
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,219
Yeah,
that's all my dad's stuff.

220
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,396
But, look, I can't be here
after dark, please.

221
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:01,144
I really... I cannot be here after...

222
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,360
You were your daddy's
little assistant, weren't you?

223
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,187
You helped with the experiments.

224
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,988
Some, but I don't know everything.

225
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,032
Now you're gonna
take your daddy's notebooks,

226
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,322
and make as much of that
fear juice as I say.

227
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:15,366
And so you don't get lonely,

228
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,573
the boys here brought you a friend.

229
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,032
No.

230
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,042
No! Stop!

231
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:23,120
No, you don't understand! Stop!

232
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:25,793
No, you don't understand!

233
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,177
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

234
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,312
May I have your attention, please?

235
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:45,442
All the money, now!

236
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:48,065
Give it to me! All of it!

237
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,148
Hey, you have a license?

238
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,863
Look at me.

239
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,085
Fiery demons. Demons.

240
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:12,878
Fiery demons, demons.

241
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,838
Demons, yeah. We'll catch 'em.

242
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,094
- Get him out of here. Go, go, go.
- Fiery demon.

243
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:20,594
Hey.

244
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:23,563
Did Penguin issue a license for this?

245
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,639
Why are you asking me?

246
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:27,734
Best of my knowledge, no.

247
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,354
Then why do something so public

248
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,192
unless you're trying
to send Penguin a message?

249
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:35,485
I hope the message was, "Please send
Victor Zsasz down here to kill me."

250
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:36,989
Because that's exactly
what's gonna happen.

251
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:38,987
- Not if I find them first.
- Hey.

252
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,540
You asked me to stop
busting crooks with licenses.

253
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,496
This gang didn't have a license.

254
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,168
And you're gonna find them before Zsasz

255
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,336
just to prove that GCPD still matters?

256
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,164
That's not thumbing your nose
at Penguin?

257
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,334
- Fire me.
- Hey, don't tempt me.

258
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:55,678
You got a lead?

259
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,632
The victims, the way they're acting,

260
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:02,310
their terror reminds me
of Crane's formula.

261
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,554
You think someone's using
the fear juice?

262
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:06,682
It ain't him, he's dead, remember,

263
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,813
not that that matters much
in this town anymore.

264
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,107
He's dead, his son isn't.

265
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:17,944
Jonathan Crane's
condition is fragile.

266
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,036
I'm afraid he can't see anyone,

267
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:23,540
certainly not the two men
who killed his father.

268
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,328
Yeah, so, uh, how many loonies you got
in this joint?

269
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:30,669
Four hundred and thirty-six total.
We mustn't call them loonies.

270
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:32,207
Of course not.

271
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:37,004
How about staff
that had access to Crane?

272
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,590
Any of them not show up for work?

273
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,642
All present and accounted for.

274
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,349
- You don't wanna check?
- I don't need to.

275
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:47,685
See, that's impressive,
'cause I run a precinct

276
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,142
and if half of my cops didn't show up,
I'd be none the wiser.

277
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:52,361
- It's true. He wouldn't.
- Clearly we have

278
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,946
different professional standards.

279
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:01,782
Jonathan Crane's father created a toxin

280
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:04,330
that makes people see their
greatest fear.

281
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,208
This morning, it was used to rob a bank.

282
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,210
How is that my problem?

283
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,541
Let me explain it to you.

284
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:15,251
See, whoever robbed the bank,
they challenged Penguin,

285
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:19,797
and all we have to do is tell Penguin
that you're involved,

286
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,925
and he'll send Victor Zsasz
down here to talk to you.

287
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:24,555
Jim, how would you describe Victor?

288
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:25,768
Victor Zsasz...

289
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,972
A homicidal maniac and sadist.

290
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,932
A homicidal maniac and sadist

291
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,898
of the highest professional standards.

292
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:38,904
So you can talk with us here and now
or you can talk to Victor.

293
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,078
They threatened me. I had no choice.

294
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,281
We want a name, putz.

295
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:53,083
I knew it rang a bell.
Grady Harris.

296
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:56,963
Ran a crew a few years back.
Him and his cousin Merton.

297
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:59,090
Couple of cowboys from the sticks.

298
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:04,799
Grady!

299
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:07,348
GCPD!

300
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:15,019
GCPD!

301
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:24,202
Well, well.
Look at what we got here.

302
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:30,624
What's wrong with you pigs?

303
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,702
Harassing honest fellows like us,

304
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:34,754
when there's real criminals out there.

305
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,875
You robbed a bank in broad daylight.
That don't make you a criminal?

306
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:41,553
I'm an outlaw. Outlaws have a code.

307
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,589
Criminals, they'll take everything.

308
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,095
They'll take a man's livelihood.

309
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,303
Like the Penguin and his licenses.

310
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:51,888
But we're gonna show him, you'll see.

311
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:56,401
Penguin wouldn't give you a license
if you begged him

312
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:58,649
till the cows came home,
you stupid hick.

313
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:03,113
You're lucky I'm not the Penguin.
He'd gut you right here.

314
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:04,697
We're better than them!

315
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:06,444
Take care.

316
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:07,987
Pigs.

317
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:22,919
Hey, check it out.

318
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:27,716
Babe, lost?

319
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,431
Ooh.

320
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:31,553
Looking for company?

321
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:36,521
She all by herself.

322
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,150
Just let me go, okay?

323
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:46,568
Not a chance.

324
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,534
Don't say I didn't warn you.

325
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:16,727
Don't turn your back on a guy
unless you're sure he's down.

326
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:20,560
Otherwise, not bad.

327
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:23,025
Does this mean we can get pizza?

328
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,293
I'm just saying,
you steal my pepperoni again,

329
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,415
- I'll break your fingers.
- So you're saying,

330
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,629
do steal your pepperoni again.

331
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:44,876
I come in peace.

332
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,388
You ladies were not easy to track down.

333
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,719
Then again, I can see
why you don't advertise.

334
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:56,972
Didn't you used to be rich?

335
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:58,807
That was before your boss stole my club.

336
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:02,394
Well, you murdered his mom

337
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:04,187
and tried to kill him.

338
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,323
So, call it even?

339
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:08,992
Is there a reason you're here?

340
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:14,197
Know about these?

341
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,911
The boss can't have you
operating on your own.

342
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,539
Now, he could just kill you,

343
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:27,169
but he figures it's time
to let bygones be bygones.

344
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:28,461
How big of him.

345
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,798
Tomorrow night's the opening
of his club,

346
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:35,227
come by, kiss the ring,

347
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,061
get your license.

348
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:39,932
Is that pepperoni?

349
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:46,604
Goes without saying,

350
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:50,655
this is one of those
"or else" kinda deals.

351
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:55,864
Later.

352
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:59,285
- We got to find a new place.
- Why?

353
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,210
If we join Penguin,
we can at least get work.

354
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,421
I came to you
because I wanted to move up.

355
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,249
And look around,

356
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,293
we're barely making it.

357
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:11,342
I'm not working for him.

358
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:13,548
Now, pack.

359
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:25,727
Detective Gordon.

360
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:28,689
Bruce.

361
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:32,817
I didn't hear you.

362
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:34,319
What happened?

363
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,748
Ah. Nothing. Harvey and I
were tracking a gang.

364
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,166
We let ourselves get surprised.

365
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:41,372
What brings you down here?

366
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:43,120
I found this when I was in the city.

367
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:45,622
Wasn't sure what to do with it.

368
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,874
One of Penguin's licenses.

369
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,421
Apparently, crime is legal now.

370
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:50,969
And you're going along with that?

371
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:52,211
Not really.

372
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,508
There's a number on the license.

373
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,761
I was thinking Penguin must have
some sort of master list.

374
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:03,144
Connecting the crime and the criminal
to the license issue.

375
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:05,850
List like that would tell you
not only who committed that crime,

376
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,816
but crimes that haven't even
happened yet.

377
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:11,648
Unfortunately, the judges

378
00:24:11,742 --> 00:24:13,108
are going along with the licenses,

379
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:14,571
and trying to track down

380
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:16,494
who in Penguin's organization
keeps the list

381
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,496
would set off too many alarms.

382
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,116
I see.

383
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,287
But you haven't given up.

384
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,920
You just said
you were out tracking a gang.

385
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,046
It's different.

386
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:32,506
This gang isn't licensed.

387
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:37,219
But Penguin will come after them,
if he hasn't already,

388
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:38,554
and when he catches them,

389
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:41,886
it'll be more proof
that Gotham doesn't need the GCPD.

390
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:45,057
Sorry, it's been a long day.

391
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,690
So, why not use Penguin
to lead you to them?

392
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,112
If I could figure out
how to do that, I would.

393
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:56,276
It was good to see you, Detective.

394
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:58,616
You should come by the house for dinner.

395
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:00,863
Yes.

396
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:03,116
I'd like that.

397
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,036
How about we grab a bite...

398
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:09,956
Tonight.

399
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,132
Exclusive but welcoming.

400
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:17,509
Urbane and edgy.

401
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,382
Tonight's opening

402
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,342
will establish the Iceberg Lounge

403
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:23,144
as Gotham's newest place to see,

404
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:24,887
and be seen.

405
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:27,019
And you say you acquired the club
from Barbara Kean?

406
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:28,691
Is that a question?

407
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,935
It's just no one's seen her
for months, and...

408
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,487
Barbara Kean's whereabouts

409
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:33,780
are not my concern.

410
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:37,200
This was The Sirens club.
It is now mine.

411
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:38,609
Mr. Cobblepot,

412
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:41,325
there's a rumor going around
about criminals being given licenses.

413
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:42,914
The rumor is you're issuing them.

414
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,951
Tell me, what is the crime rate
in Gotham?

415
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:47,786
We're at historic lows.

416
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,295
Historic lows...

417
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,376
You know, Augustus Caesar once presided

418
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:58,714
over the longest period of peace
and prosperity the world has ever known.

419
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,052
It was called the Pax Romana.

420
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:05,637
Perhaps one day, this will be known
as the Pax Penguina.

421
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:07,892
That's not a denial.

422
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:10,733
We're here to talk about my club.

423
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:14,483
Your readers will find this interesting.
Ivy?

424
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:20,485
That's Edward Nygma.

425
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:24,330
Turns out, Ed had
a very rare brain disease,

426
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:26,082
and there was only one option,

427
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:27,875
to freeze him and wait for the cure.

428
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,496
In his final lucid moments,

429
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:36,798
he begged me,
"Oswald, do not hide me away.

430
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:38,673
"Put me out with the people."

431
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:42,591
It was the least I could do.

432
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:45,051
Anyone tell him he was being frozen?

433
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:49,310
I have affidavits from his doctor
if you would like to see them.

434
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:50,389
No, thanks.

435
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:57,939
Well, Jim.

436
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:00,988
I'm rather busy,
so whatever your business is...

437
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:02,944
I came to tell you you're a fraud.

438
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,323
The gang that has Crane's fear toxin,

439
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,452
they're not afraid of you.

440
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:10,535
Others will find out.
That's how it begins.

441
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:15,131
You've had a nice run, Oswald,
but it's over.

442
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:20,428
Oh, Jim, it's so hard to admit
when you've become irrelevant.

443
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:25,008
Let me tell you what's gonna happen.

444
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:26,972
I'm going to find this gang

445
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:28,762
and I'm going to crush them.

446
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:32,649
And everyone will see
that it is Oswald Cobblepot,

447
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,102
the Penguin, who keeps Gotham safe.

448
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,939
Always good to see you, old friend.

449
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:44,487
<i>As he prepares for the opening
of the Iceberg Lounge,</i>

450
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:47,656
<i>Oswald Cobblepot announced
that he would destroy the gang</i>

451
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:51,459
<i>that attacked
Gotham First National Bank yesterday.</i>

452
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:52,785
<i>He described them as</i>

453
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,462
<i>cowards and pond scum.</i>

454
00:27:56,884 --> 00:27:58,876
Penguin's goin' down tonight.

455
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:04,714
- You finish that new batch yet?
- Yes.

456
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:08,510
Now, can you please...
Can you please get rid of that, please?

457
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:12,564
- What, you and him ain't gettin' along?
- Please, just get rid of it.

458
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:15,562
Listen, I got to do some things tonight,

459
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:18,441
but I think you guys should
spend some time together. Huh?

460
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,572
We all have our fears to face.

461
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:25,322
Stop! Stop! Please, stop!

462
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:26,948
Please! No!

463
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:28,863
Stop!

464
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,667
Let me out!

465
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:39,666
Remember how you accused me
of being a slave to my emotions?

466
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:41,792
No more.

467
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,920
I have banished those feelings.

468
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:46,510
And look how I have risen.

469
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:50,468
But at what cost?

470
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:53,354
I wonder which of us is frozen.

471
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:55,973
Him.

472
00:28:57,194 --> 00:28:58,730
He's, like, totally frozen.

473
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:02,446
Ivy, go somewhere else.

474
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:12,865
All right,

475
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,326
I want two unmarked units
at street level

476
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:18,413
and another two teams with me and Harvey
watching the entrances to the club.

477
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,418
The moment that gang arrives, we move.

478
00:29:23,804 --> 00:29:26,512
You heard the man! Suit up, let's go!

479
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:32,806
Can we count on them?

480
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:35,980
Let's see. You tricked Penguin
into baiting the gang to attack his club

481
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:38,479
hoping to arrest them
before they cause mass panic

482
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,861
only so you could embarrass Penguin.
So I would say, yeah, they're about as

483
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,987
dependable as any other part
of this cockamamie plan.

484
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:46,236
Thanks, I'll get the gas masks.

485
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:02,673
Please, let me out!

486
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:06,127
<i>Jonathan.</i>

487
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:14,969
Let me out!

488
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:17,388
<i>Jonathan!</i>

489
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:35,619
- So, you guys work for Penguin, huh?
- It ain't like that.

490
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,700
- Sure.
- Come on, Gordon.

491
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,457
Since Penguin's been cracking down,
life's been good.

492
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:41,663
Why you gotta rock the boat?

493
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:46,418
What happens when he starts giving out
licenses for murders?

494
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:49,508
Huh? What then?

495
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:52,761
- I'm wasting my breath, aren't I?
- Pretty much.

496
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:56,719
All right, then.

497
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,680
Who wants it first?

498
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,532
Mr. Wayne. Mr. Pennyworth.

499
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:20,539
- I am so glad you could make it.
- It's our pleasure.

500
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:22,453
Congratulations.

501
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:25,499
We were just admiring your frozen mate.

502
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,296
Is he still alive in there?

503
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:30,462
I fear we may never know.

504
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,630
But you'll know when
you finally thaw him out,

505
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,557
when they discover
a cure for his disease.

506
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:38,557
Oh, yes, then, of course.

507
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:40,262
I wanted to personally thank you

508
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:41,689
for everything you've done
for this city.

509
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:43,975
Thank you, Mr. Wayne.

510
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:46,394
So...

511
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:49,067
Can I ask about the licenses?

512
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,987
A little discretion, if you would,
Master Bruce?

513
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:53,158
Everybody's talking about it, Alfred,

514
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:54,406
I just want to know how it works.

515
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:57,572
So, does someone come to you and say,

516
00:31:58,667 --> 00:31:59,657
"I want to rob a bank"?

517
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:03,457
Now, Bruce, if I didn't know any better,

518
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:05,630
I would think
that you wanted me to implicate myself.

519
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:07,502
Anything you say stays between us.

520
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,051
First, let me ask,

521
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:15,306
you would be agreeable
to the idea of licensed crime?

522
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:18,058
If crime had been licensed
and controlled three years ago,

523
00:32:18,145 --> 00:32:19,431
my parents would still be alive.

524
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,054
Exactly so.

525
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,558
Well, between us,

526
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,819
I have nothing to do
with the licenses directly.

527
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:32,320
I provide the guidelines while Mr. Penn

528
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,150
handles all of the details.

529
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,487
Now, would you excuse me?

530
00:32:43,837 --> 00:32:45,419
- Well done, sir.
- Thank you.

531
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:47,709
Now we know who has the list.

532
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:49,957
The next step is...

533
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:53,169
Selina.

534
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:03,471
Where's your babysitter?

535
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,190
It's kind of a package deal.

536
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:08,609
Yeah, well, he's got me.

537
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:10,937
Is that good enough or not?

538
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:14,399
Actually, we're both in.

539
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:21,330
- I should pat you down for weapons.
- Sure.

540
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:24,914
- If you wanna lose a hand.
- It was worth a shot.

541
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:27,036
I'll tell the boss.

542
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:30,289
See ya.

543
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,180
You were worried about me.

544
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:50,105
Hey, man,
I've been looking all over for you.

545
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:52,277
Ooh, ouch.

546
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,446
Think we can forget about backup.

547
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:57,404
I see you talked to some of your
fellow officers.

548
00:33:58,161 --> 00:33:59,993
- Probably not a bad thing.
- How's that?

549
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:03,372
Guys get to let off steam,
resentments don't fester.

550
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,707
Next time, you can get punched
in the face.

551
00:34:05,794 --> 00:34:07,660
This beautiful mug, no one would dare.

552
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:08,994
Let's go.

553
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:20,048
All right, once inside,
get Zsasz and Penguin first,

554
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,222
and then go crazy.

555
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:22,717
I still don't see Penguin.

556
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:24,677
Hello!

557
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:29,186
I'm guessing that gas isn't faster
than a bullet, what do you think?

558
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:34,820
Jim Gordon
and his ham-fisted manipulation.

559
00:34:36,283 --> 00:34:37,273
He thought he fooled me.

560
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:39,324
You wanna do 'em here or downstairs?

561
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,610
- Might be a little loud in here.
- Neither.

562
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:46,582
I have something special planned
for them.

563
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:03,637
What do you want, Bruce?

564
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:07,136
You knew I'd follow you.

565
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:09,438
Just like I knew you'd come up here.

566
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:12,103
You don't know anything about me.

567
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:17,780
I wanted to apologize
for what I said at the hospital

568
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:19,107
when you came to visit Alfred.

569
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:21,779
You were making a kind gesture.

570
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,452
You wanna talk to me, come up here.

571
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:42,470
My point is, I'm sorry.

572
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:49,053
Yeah, you were a jerk.

573
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,525
I saw you arrive with Tabitha Galavan.

574
00:35:58,031 --> 00:35:59,647
I'm not sure I'd choose her as a mentor.

575
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:00,898
Wow.

576
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:04,990
That means absolutely nothing to me.

577
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,410
Selina...

578
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:15,954
Oh?

579
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:19,341
You wanna say something?

580
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:26,053
It's a lovely dress
you're wearing tonight.

581
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:30,098
Honestly, you two,

582
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:33,230
why can't you just go to the cinema
like normal teenagers?

583
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:37,436
And, Master Bruce, we got
a bit of a situation downstairs, sir.

584
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:39,853
What sort of situation?

585
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,440
Ms. Kyle.

586
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:51,949
For the past three months,
I have given this city

587
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:54,000
a tranquility it has never known.

588
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:57,956
Now, I would like to ensure that peace
for the future.

589
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:00,124
In the weeks to come,

590
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:01,967
you will hear whispers

591
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,090
about what's happening
on the streets of Gotham.

592
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:06,093
All you need to know is

593
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:09,933
without me, this is what you get.

594
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:13,554
Men who want to bring fear
back to our city.

595
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:16,857
Who promise a return to the old days.

596
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,481
So, tell your families,

597
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,278
tell your friends,

598
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:25,616
it is Oswald Cobblepot
who keeps them safe.

599
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,069
Not the GCPD.

600
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:32,322
You're welcome.

601
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:40,290
I have my things in the car,
we can stop them in the parking garage.

602
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:41,919
Absolutely not, Master Bruce.

603
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:44,510
Alfred, Penguin's gonna take
those men out and kill them.

604
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:45,586
Undoubtedly so.

605
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:48,047
But, as you said before,
you can make a difference.

606
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:52,556
There is time for masks,
and there is a time for Bruce Wayne.

607
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:55,604
Do you know
what's going to be done to you?

608
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:56,680
Wait!

609
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:00,146
I want to know what
you're gonna do with those men.

610
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,732
You need not concern yourself with that.

611
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:04,609
Are those men going to be turned over
to the police?

612
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:13,990
Earlier tonight, you thanked me
for making the city safer.

613
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,200
Now, how do you think that happened?

614
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:19,624
I do the dirty work no one else will.

615
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,790
I understand.

616
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:26,051
But I'm asking you,
turn those men over to the police.

617
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:29,338
You're young.

618
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:32,925
You have a good heart.

619
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:38,388
No.

620
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:44,441
Enjoy your party, Penguin.

621
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:45,896
You little twerp.

622
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:12,422
What's wrong?

623
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:13,715
You scared?

624
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:25,143
No!

625
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,356
Hey!

626
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:33,569
You're under arrest.

627
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:36,740
By order of the Gotham City
Police Department. Cuff him.

628
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,252
Help me. Help me.

629
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:53,884
Penguin
ain't gonna be too happy.

630
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:57,259
Screw him.

631
00:39:58,688 --> 00:40:00,429
I'm just worried
about finding Jonathan Crane.

632
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,103
If he's out there
with access to his father's formula...

633
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,808
Relax, we'll find him.

634
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:07,398
Wouldn't expect too much help
from these parts, though.

635
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:08,980
There's good cops out there.

636
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:10,647
They just need reminding.

637
00:40:28,718 --> 00:40:29,708
You have a list

638
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:33,050
of all the licenses you've given.
I want it.

639
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:35,715
I... I can't.

640
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:39,343
Penguin, he'll...

641
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,807
- What about the alarm?
- Forget it.

642
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,554
We got a license, remember?

643
00:41:31,698 --> 00:41:32,688
Oh, no.

644
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:35,857
What the...

645
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:42,447
GCPD.

646
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:45,493
Gotham Police, you're under arrest.

647
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:49,879
Crane, you got to make more
