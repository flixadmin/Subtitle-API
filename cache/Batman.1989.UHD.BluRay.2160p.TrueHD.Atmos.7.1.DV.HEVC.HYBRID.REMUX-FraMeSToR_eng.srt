1
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,425
I'll get it. Taxi!

2
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,178
Thank you. Hi.

3
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,764
I'd like to go to the Adelphi Hotel,
and that's--

4
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:03,266
- Excuse me. I'm sorry, this is my cab.
- Get inside.

5
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,769
No, listen-- I was here first!

6
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,437
Oh, God.

7
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,898
Taxi! Taxi!

8
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:13,860
Taxi!

9
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:18,448
Let's go across. Come on.

10
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:21,618
We'll get one down the road.
Come on. Hurry.

11
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:29,584
For God's sake, Harold,
can we please just get a taxi?

12
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,294
I'm trying to get a-- Taxi!

13
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,964
We're going the wrong way.

14
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,468
- Put that away. We look like tourists.
- Hi, honey.

15
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,637
We'll never get a cab.
Let's cut to Seventh.

16
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:44,474
- Seventh is that way.
- I know where we are.

17
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:07,330
Hey, mister, give me a dollar.

18
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,833
- Come on.
- Hey, mister, how about it? One dollar.

19
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:13,169
You deaf? You don't speak English?

20
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,171
Come on. Come on. Up here.

21
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,428
Hey, lady, do the kid a favor...

22
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,430
...don't scream.

23
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:45,201
Hey, all right.

24
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:49,205
American Express Card.
"Don't leave home without it."

25
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:52,417
Hey, get out of here.

26
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:59,799
- Let's beat it, man. I don't like it up here.
- What, are you scared of heights?

27
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:03,219
I don't know.
After what happened to Johnny Gobs--

28
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:06,598
Hey, look, man. Johnny Gobs got ripped
and took a walk off a roof.

29
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:08,433
- No big loss.
- No, man.

30
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,061
That ain't what I heard at all.

31
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,523
- I heard that the bat got him.
- The bat?

32
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,817
Oh, man. Give me a break, will you?

33
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:21,905
Five stories, straight down.
There wasn't no blood in the body.

34
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:25,492
No shit.
It was all over the pavement.

35
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:32,123
- I'm getting out of here, man.
- Hey, shut up, man. Listen to me.

36
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,293
There ain't no bat.

37
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,005
Yeah, well, you shouldn't have turned
the gun on that kid, man.

38
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,341
Do you want your cut
of this money or not?

39
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:42,759
Now, shut up.

40
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:45,345
Shut up.

41
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,141
Don't kill me! Don't kill me, man!

42
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,893
Don't kill me! Don't kill me, man!

43
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,813
I'm not going to kill you.
I want you to do me a favor.

44
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,733
- Tell all your friends about me.
- What are you?

45
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,153
I'm Batman.

46
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,425
Across this nation...

47
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:08,094
...the words "Gotham City"
are synonymous with crime.

48
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,973
Our streets are overrun.

49
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,267
Our public officials are helpless.

50
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:18,354
As mayor, I promise to root out
the source of this corruption...

51
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:19,606
...Boss Carl Grissom.

52
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,026
Now, our new district attorney...

53
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:27,197
...Harvey Dent will carry out
that promise. Harvey.

54
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:32,786
Thank you.

55
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:37,499
Thank you, Mayor Borg. Thank you.

56
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,043
People of Gotham City...

57
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,379
...I'm a man of few words.

58
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:47,550
But those words will count,
and so will my actions.

59
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:50,011
Police Commissioner Gordon
has informed me...

60
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,472
...that he has targeted
those businesses...

61
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,434
...suspected of fronting
for the syndicate in this city.

62
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,771
Before the week is out...

63
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:02,899
...we are going to knock down
their doors...

64
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:08,154
...and shed the light of the law
on that nest of vipers.

65
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:14,828
Together, we can make this city
safe for decent people.

66
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,333
Decent people shouldn't live here.

67
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,294
They'd be happier someplace else.

68
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:26,047
Pretty tough talk about Carl.

69
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:28,842
Don't worry about it.

70
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:32,887
If this clown could touch Grissom,
I'd have handed him his lungs by now.

71
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:37,016
If Grissom knew about us...

72
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:40,061
...he might hand you something.

73
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,273
Don't flatter yourself, angel.

74
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,608
He's a tired old man.

75
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,820
He can't run this city without me.

76
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,198
And besides...

77
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:56,035
...he doesn't know.

78
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:02,333
You don't worry about anything,
do you, Jack?

79
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,762
You look fine.

80
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,850
I didn't ask.

81
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,903
- Yeah. Hanging on. Hanging on.
- Coming through.

82
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,487
Get out of the way. Come on.

83
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,662
No, no, no. Let me guess.

84
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:43,041
Giant, menacing, supernatural form.

85
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:45,501
- Kind of like a bat.
- Yeah, that's it.

86
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,462
What are they seeing up there?

87
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:51,549
- They're drinking Drano.
- It's a little weird, lieutenant.

88
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,509
Thanks for the tip, Duane.

89
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,679
Christ. Knox.

90
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,599
Hello, Lt. Eckhardt.
I hear we just had another bat attack.

91
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,435
That's, what, eight sightings now
in under a month?

92
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,854
I hear the commissioner's
opened a file. True?

93
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:08,191
Sorry, Knox,
these two slipped on a banana peel.

94
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,445
I'm telling you, man, a giant bat.

95
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,031
Sure you did. Keep moving.

96
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:18,368
Don't be writing this stuff
in the newspaper, Knox.

97
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,787
It will ruin your
already useless reputation.

98
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:24,248
Lieutenant, every punk
in this town is scared stiff.

99
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:27,418
You know what they say?
They say he can't be killed.

100
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:33,549
- They say he drinks blood. They say--
- I say you're full of shit, Knox.

101
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,554
You can quote me on that.

102
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:42,225
Lieutenant, is there a 6-foot bat
in Gotham City?

103
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:44,560
And if so, is he on the police payroll?

104
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:47,438
And if so, what's he pulling down,
after taxes?

105
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:19,262
Brought you a little snack, Eckhardt.

106
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,180
Why don't you broadcast it?

107
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,350
Shut up and listen.

108
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:29,230
Harvey Dent has been sniffing around
one of our front companies.

109
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:34,277
That's my territory.
If there's a problem, I deal with it.

110
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:36,279
Your problems are our problems.

111
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:41,242
I answer to Grissom, not to psychos.

112
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:44,787
Why, Eckhardt,
you ought to think about the future.

113
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:49,792
You mean when you run the show?
You ain't got no future, Jack.

114
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:53,463
You're an A-1 nut boy,
and Grissom knows it.

115
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,803
Better be sure.

116
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:08,269
See...

117
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:11,898
...you can make a good decision
when you try.

118
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,866
Where you been spending your nights?

119
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:31,000
I don't care how deeply in debt
this festival is, I want a parade.

120
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,503
I want hot dogs, balloons,
the whole schmeer.

121
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:37,173
We are going to celebrate this
200th anniversary proudly and publicly.

122
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,509
Well, we may be celebrating
in bankruptcy court.

123
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:43,179
This festival is $250,000 in the red,
and we haven't seen one balloon.

124
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:46,682
You fill this square with people,
and the businesses will come back here.

125
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,727
A lot of people might stay away, mayor.
They're scared.

126
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:53,022
They won't be scared
when you get Grissom in that courthouse.

127
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:56,317
I promised that, remember?

128
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:02,740
Well, welcome, Count Dracula.
Had any sightings of Big Foot lately?

129
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:07,453
- Knox, they buried your story on Batman.
- That's what they do to garbage.

130
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,747
This is Pulitzer Prize stuff, guys.

131
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:12,875
Hey, Knox.
Knox, I got something for you.

132
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:19,048
Very funny. You should have a little more
gore under the fangs, though, right?

133
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,717
What a dick.

134
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,972
Hello, legs.

135
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,976
I'm reading your stuff.

136
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,311
Well, I'm reading yours.

137
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,397
Hi, I'm Vicki Vale.

138
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:37,483
Vicki Vale. Yeah, yeah. Photographer.
Vogue, Cosmo. Yeah.

139
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,404
Listen, if you want me to pose nude,
you're gonna need a long lens.

140
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:44,282
Actually, I was in the Corto Maltese.

141
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:50,538
A girl could get hurt doing this stuff.
So, what brings you here?

142
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:53,624
I'm here to see some of the wildlife
in Gotham City.

143
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,169
Wildlife? Like what?

144
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,630
Like bats.

145
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,302
- Who sent you?
- No, nobody. Really.

146
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,429
I just loved your story, and I...

147
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,599
I like bats.

148
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:11,767
Yeah?

149
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:15,479
My pictures, your words.
Pulitzer Prize material. Just think--

150
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,190
Okay, you're a visionary.

151
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,442
You're also the only one
who believes me.

152
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,319
I need something tangible.

153
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:24,947
Gordon's got a file on this.
I can't even get him on the phone.

154
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,450
Bruce Wayne's benefit.
He'll be there, right?

155
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:32,121
Yeah. I don't seem to be
on the guest list. No. No.

156
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,458
Yes. Yes.

157
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,627
- Vale, will you marry me?
- Nope.

158
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:40,046
- Will you buy me lunch?
- Maybe.

159
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:41,797
I eat light.

160
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:52,642
Say, this son of a bitch...

161
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:56,312
...makes a connection
with us and with Axis Chemicals.

162
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:58,648
What kind of damage are we looking at?

163
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:02,276
If he ties us in with Axis Chemical,
we're dead and buried.

164
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,487
We should move immediately.

165
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:07,949
I say we break into the place...

166
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,784
...trash the office...

167
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:14,538
...and make off with the records
and say it was industrial espionage.

168
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,332
Jack...

169
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,335
...smart thinking. That's the way to go.

170
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:23,839
In fact, I'd like you to handle
this operation personally.

171
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,510
Me?

172
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:37,770
Hello, sweetheart. I wonder if you'd mind
waiting in the next room?

173
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,745
That's all, gentlemen. Thank you.
Thank you, gentlemen. That's all.

174
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,841
Carl...

175
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,678
...can we get somebody else to do this?

176
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,222
And the fumes in that place...

177
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,100
Jack...

178
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:22,606
...it's an important job.
I need someone I can trust.

179
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:26,652
You are my number one guy.

180
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,364
Now...

181
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,159
...don't forget...

182
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:37,413
...your lucky deck.

183
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,426
My friend...

184
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:53,763
...your luck is about to change.

185
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,310
Police department.

186
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:01,771
Get me Lieutenant Eckhardt.

187
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:45,815
Can I help you, sir?

188
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:49,318
Oh, thanks. Thank you very much.
It's very nice of you.

189
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:51,529
Here you go.

190
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:04,500
- Good evening, ma'am.
- A little crowded.

191
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:14,260
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

192
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:18,389
Could you tell me which of these guys
is Bruce Wayne?

193
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:20,891
Well, I'm not sure.

194
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,309
Thanks anyway.

195
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:24,353
Yeah.

196
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,524
- Thank you.
- Certainly, yeah.

197
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:53,424
Your roll, commissioner.

198
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:56,260
My turn, my turn.
Here we go. Here we go.

199
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,388
- Eight.
- Eight. I can make that eight.

200
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,515
I can make that eight.

201
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,727
Commissioner.
Mrs. Gordon, you look lovely.

202
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:08,397
How about that rumor the commissioner's
got a file on the Batman. True?

203
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,483
Not for the ninth time. There is no bat.

204
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,860
If there were, we'd find him.
We'd arrest him.

205
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:15,237
- Do you confirm him? Be straight.
- Big eight.

206
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,239
- How you making out?
- No good at all.

207
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,908
Mr. Dent, I love that tie.

208
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:22,411
Gordo and I were discussing
the pros and cons of winged vigilantes.

209
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,579
What's your stand?

210
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:25,998
Mr. Knox, we have enough problems
in this city...

211
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,542
...without worrying about ghosts
and goblins.

212
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:31,420
Pardon me, but that's not--
That's not a denial.

213
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,424
Excuse me, dear. I'll be back.

214
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,218
Isn't anybody gonna go on record?

215
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:40,554
- Your Honor, great suit.
- No comment.

216
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:44,600
- Robert, what's up?
- Anonymous tip.

217
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,560
Napier's cleaning out Axis Chemicals.

218
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:56,570
Why wasn't I told about this?
Who's in charge?

219
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:57,780
Eckhardt, sir.

220
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:00,950
Oh, my God. Come on, let's go.
Let's go.

221
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:07,665
Commissioner Gordon?

222
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,792
Vale, I think he went in this room.

223
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:14,588
Commissioner Gordon?

224
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:27,476
Wait, wait, wait.
Living room, dining room, arsenal.

225
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,812
Look at this stuff.

226
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:31,981
Who is this guy?

227
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:37,152
He gives to all these humanitarian causes,
and then collects all this stuff.

228
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:40,864
He probably does it to get chicks.
They like him for his big charity balls.

229
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:44,201
Yeah, and don't leave out
his very large bankroll.

230
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:47,162
Remember, the more they've got,
the less they're worth.

231
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,749
Then this guy must be
the most worthless guy in America.

232
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,167
Check this out.

233
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:55,504
He must have been
king of the wicker people.

234
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:00,884
- Where did this come from?
- I have no idea.

235
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,806
- It's Japanese.
- How do you know?

236
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,726
Because I bought it in Japan.

237
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,895
- Who are you?
- Oh, sorry. Bruce Wayne.

238
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,358
- Alexander Knox.
- Hi.

239
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,861
Oh, I read your work.
I like it. I like it a lot.

240
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:20,738
Oh, thanks. Can I have a grant?

241
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:24,450
- Vicki Vale.
- Hi.

242
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:27,328
- Bruce Wayne.
- Are you sure?

243
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,121
Yeah, this time.

244
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:32,333
I've seen your photographs
from Corto Maltese, haven't I?

245
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:35,252
- Right.
- Yeah, you've got a wonderful eye.

246
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,129
Yeah, some people think she has two.

247
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:41,550
This is an amazing house.
I'd like to shoot it sometime, if you--

248
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,720
Mr. Wayne, we need to open a few more
cases of the champagne.

249
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:47,556
- Will that be all right?
- Oh, sure. Go ahead.

250
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:50,351
Open, what, six?

251
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:52,519
- Six?
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Six is good.

252
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:53,771
Okay. Yeah.

253
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:56,607
That's great, six. Thanks.

254
00:21:56,774 --> 00:22:00,152
- You going to be in Gotham for a while?
- I'd love to.

255
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,739
I'm intrigued by Alex's
giant bat stories, so...

256
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:08,118
Oh, the-- Right.
Bat-- The Batman. Thing.

257
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:12,122
Yeah. That's a little bit light after the war
in Corto Maltese, isn't it?

258
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,500
- And what do you do for a living?
- Well, I'm--

259
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:18,128
Sir, Commissioner Gordon
was compelled to leave.

260
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:21,757
- Okay, thank you.
- Very unexpectedly, sir.

261
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:28,222
- Will you two excuse me?
- I think, perhaps, this way, sir.

262
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,432
Alfred, they need more wine
in the front.

263
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:33,977
And someone named Mrs. Daley
needs a copy of the menu.

264
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:35,688
Oh, and...

265
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,773
...give Knox a grant.

266
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:44,279
Nice talking with you, Wayne.

267
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,864
The rich...

268
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:49,618
You know why they're so odd?
Because they can afford to be.

269
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:53,622
I mean, look at this mirror.
Maybe it should be Bruce Vain.

270
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,872
- Robert, what's up?
- Anonymous tip.

271
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:38,333
- Napier's cleaning out Axis Chemicals.
- Good Lord.

272
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,545
If we can put our hands on him,
we'd have Grissom.

273
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:44,256
Why wasn't I told about this?
Who's in charge?

274
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:47,092
- Eckhardt, sir.
- Oh, my God.

275
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,761
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

276
00:23:58,187 --> 00:24:00,606
All right, take a good look.
This is the guy.

277
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,445
All right, get a good look.

278
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:10,032
Shoot to kill.
Know what I mean?

279
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,035
All right, let's move out.

280
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:49,696
We've been ratted out here, boys.
Watch it.

281
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,663
Freeze!

282
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:18,100
Left. You, take the right.
Move it. Move it.

283
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,810
What the hell's going on?

284
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:22,271
Christ. What're you trying to do,
blow the collar?

285
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:25,440
I'm in charge here, not Carl Grissom.

286
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:27,860
This is Commissioner Gordon.

287
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,445
I want him taken alive.

288
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:36,118
I repeat, any man who opens fire
on Jack Napier will answer to me.

289
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:24,917
Let me down!

290
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,210
Let me down!

291
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,214
Let me down!

292
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:33,759
Oh, my God.

293
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:43,268
Go that way!

294
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:45,247
See if you can get up on the catwalk
on that side.

295
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:47,958
You take that side. Be careful.
Be very careful.

296
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:04,850
Jesus!

297
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:10,522
Let him go, or I'll do Gordon!

298
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:23,493
Nice outfit.

299
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:38,508
Come on, Jack, let's go!

300
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:47,642
- Come on!
- Come on, Jack!

301
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:49,311
Eckhardt.

302
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:52,731
Think about the future.

303
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:38,860
Goddamn it, we had him.

304
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:41,696
Hold it right there!

305
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:56,545
Who is this guy?

306
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,797
I don't know.

307
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:03,009
Until we find out, keep a lid on it.

308
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,617
Wait, wait, wait. If there's no bat...

309
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:30,203
...then who dropped this guy, Napier,
into the acid?

310
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:33,957
Suicide? Wait a minute.
I wanna get this on tape, okay?

311
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:35,417
Hello?

312
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:37,210
He hung up.

313
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:40,213
- Okay, what do you got?
- Okay, here's the inner city.

314
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,132
Axis Chemicals. Here're the sightings.

315
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:45,302
Maybe Batman has some kind of
flight pattern or something.

316
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:47,679
- That's all I can think of.
- This is very good.

317
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,932
Tonight, I'll take you to dinner,
and then we'll walk the trail.

318
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,602
No can do.
I got a date with Bruce Wayne.

319
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:55,437
Wayne? Wayne.

320
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:57,689
- I knew you'd say that.
- The guy's a stiff.

321
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:02,360
- He's a rich stiff, but you could do better.
- Thanks for being so concerned. Bye.

322
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:18,126
How's the soup?

323
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:20,962
Excuse me?

324
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:24,049
The soup...

325
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:27,135
- ...how is it?
- It's great.

326
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,643
Could you pass the salt?

327
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:37,062
Sure.

328
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:43,818
Thanks.

329
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:57,457
Did you have a hard time
finding the house?

330
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:58,792
Oh, no.

331
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:01,002
- No, it was no problem.
- Good.

332
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:08,009
Do you like eating in here?

333
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,971
Oh, yeah.

334
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:18,603
The truth, I don't think I've ever been
in this room before.

335
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:24,985
- Do you wanna get out of here?
- Yes.

336
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:34,869
There was young Master Bruce...

337
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:38,039
...leading his gray pony
with me on its back...

338
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,875
...like a sack of old potatoes
covered in mud...

339
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,752
...and nursing a sprained ankle.

340
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:47,716
That was the first and last time
I gave him a riding lesson.

341
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:52,220
Well, I think I've embarrassed him
for long enough.

342
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:55,223
I'm off to bed.

343
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:58,727
But please leave everything.
I'll tidy up in the morning.

344
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:00,770
- Good night, miss.
- Good night, Alfred.

345
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:03,064
- Good night, sir.
- Night, Alfred.

346
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:12,198
He's really wonderful.
He loves you a lot.

347
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:15,910
Alfred's great.
I couldn't find my socks without him.

348
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:20,123
He sort of reminds me
of my grandfather.

349
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:22,625
Were you close to him?

350
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:25,754
Yeah, I used to spend summers
with he and my grandmother.

351
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:30,091
They had a house on the lake.
Nothing like this, but...

352
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:34,763
- But it was fun.
- That sounds nice.

353
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:36,306
Yeah.

354
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,768
What about your family?

355
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:41,186
Well...

356
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,314
...actually, Alfred is my family.

357
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:51,905
You know, this house and all this stuff
really doesn't seem like you at all.

358
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:57,869
Some of it is very much me.

359
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,789
Some of it isn't.

360
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:06,503
- That dining room is definitely not you.
- No, the dining room isn't.

361
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:32,821
Let's see how we did.

362
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:54,008
Oh, my God.

363
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:56,428
Mirror.

364
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:59,472
Mirror!

365
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:13,027
You understand that the nerves
were completely severed, Mr. Napier.

366
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:20,952
You see what I have to work with here.

367
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:47,353
There are an awful lot of stairs
in this place. My feet are killing me.

368
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,191
Okay.

369
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:53,902
Well...

370
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:59,073
I feel a little drunk,
and you're not anything.

371
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,910
Hey, one drink and I'm flying.

372
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,913
Why are you afraid of flying?

373
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:37,070
That you, sugar bumps?

374
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,949
Who the hell are you?

375
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:44,577
It's me, sugar bumps.

376
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,997
Jack.

377
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,627
Thank God you're alive.
I heard you'd been--

378
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:56,047
Fried? Is that what you heard?

379
00:36:56,798 --> 00:36:58,716
You set me up over a woman.

380
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,970
A woman!

381
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:04,305
Must be insane.

382
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:20,989
Don't bother.

383
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:23,825
Your life won't be worth spit!

384
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,662
I've been dead once already.

385
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:30,206
It's very liberating.

386
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:33,960
You should think of it as therapy.

387
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:38,006
Jack, listen...

388
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:41,718
...maybe we can cut a deal.

389
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:45,096
"Jack"?

390
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,932
Jack is dead, my friend.

391
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:51,227
You can call me "Joker."

392
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:55,857
And as you can see,
I'm a lot happier.

393
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:24,052
What a day.

394
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,608
Gotham City.

395
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:26,948
Always brings a smile to my face.

396
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:32,620
"Winged freak...

397
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,542
...terrorizes..."

398
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:43,965
Wait till they get a load of me.

399
00:39:57,437 --> 00:40:00,148
Hey, I've got an idea.

400
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:03,151
How about lunch at my place?
I'll show you some photos.

401
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:04,777
Sure. Okay.

402
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:06,154
Wait a minute.

403
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,990
No, I can't. I can't make it.

404
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:11,826
Okay, we'll do it later in the day.

405
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:13,995
Hold on. I can't make it then either.

406
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:16,998
I've got a very important meeting today.

407
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:18,916
What's wrong?

408
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:22,128
Nothing's wrong.

409
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:25,089
I've just got to go out of town
on business for a few days.

410
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:28,092
- Okay, we'll do it when you get back.
- All right.

411
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:31,012
I've got to go. I'm late.

412
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,390
- Bye.
- Come here.

413
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:37,351
Bye.

414
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:42,273
Jesus.

415
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:47,945
- Alfred.
- It's nice to see you again, ma'am.

416
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,989
Nice to see you too.

417
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:54,035
Well, I'll talk to you guys
when you get back.

418
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:57,497
Back, Miss Vale?
We're going to be here for quite a while.

419
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:01,417
Well, bye.

420
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:14,472
Honey, you'll never believe
what happened to me today.

421
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:30,279
So gentlemen, that's how it is.

422
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:35,409
Until Grissom resurfaces,
I'm the acting president...

423
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:38,955
...and I say,
starting with this anniversary festival...

424
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:41,249
...we run this city into the ground.

425
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:44,961
- Why don't we hear this from Grissom?
- Yeah.

426
00:41:45,795 --> 00:41:47,922
And what's with that stupid grin?

427
00:41:49,799 --> 00:41:52,760
Life's been good to me.

428
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:57,431
What if we say no?

429
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,602
Well, Tony...

430
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:05,523
...nobody wants a war.

431
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:09,944
If we can't do business, why,
we'll just shake hands, and that'll be it.

432
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:13,030
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

433
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:24,041
Oh, I got a live one here.

434
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:35,636
Oh, there will be a hot time
In the old town tonight

435
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:55,948
Antoine got a little hot under the collar.

436
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:59,076
You're crazy.

437
00:43:01,162 --> 00:43:04,832
Haven't you ever heard
of the healing power of laughter?

438
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:15,426
- Now get out of here!
- You heard him, let's go! Move it!

439
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,678
And think it over.

440
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:20,932
- Come on, let's go!
- Come on, up, up! Faster! Get out of here!

441
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:23,100
Come on, get out of here!

442
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,946
Bob.

443
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:40,201
Go down to the Globe, follow
that reporter, Knox. Take your camera.

444
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:43,371
See what he knows about this Batman.

445
00:43:44,664 --> 00:43:46,082
And, Bob...

446
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:50,878
Remember...

447
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,546
...you...

448
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:57,426
...are my number one guy.

449
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:00,972
Yes, sir.

450
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:19,949
Your pals,
they're not bad people.

451
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:26,372
Maybe we ought to give them
a couple of days to think it over.

452
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:29,208
No?

453
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:36,549
Grease them now?

454
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:40,970
Okay.

455
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:45,349
You are a vicious bastard, Rotelli.

456
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:49,145
I'm glad you're dead.

457
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:58,821
I'm glad you're dead.

458
00:45:02,992 --> 00:45:05,286
I'm glad you're dead!

459
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:12,918
I need that.

460
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:16,672
I'm losing confidence in you.
I thought we were a team.

461
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:20,301
This wouldn't be a personal issue
for you, would it?

462
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:23,637
- I just want you to do your job.
- I am doing my job.

463
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:26,974
- Me too. I'm protecting my partner.
- There's nothing in these files.

464
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:29,810
No photos, no histories, no nothing.
Who is this guy?

465
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:32,021
Who cares?

466
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:36,901
Forget about Bruce Wayne.
I'm on to Batman.

467
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:29,555
They should be out any second.

468
00:47:29,722 --> 00:47:32,433
I can't wait to hear the explanation
for this one.

469
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:38,939
Here he comes, man.

470
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:41,984
So, what's this affidavit you filed?

471
00:47:42,151 --> 00:47:43,944
Grissom gave you all his businesses?

472
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:47,615
Mr. Grissom asked me,
as a personal favor...

473
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:50,784
...to take over the operation
of his businesses until he returns.

474
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:55,080
That's a pretty big favor.
You two must have been very close.

475
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:58,667
- Very close.
- Did you do time together as children?

476
00:48:41,085 --> 00:48:45,381
Our accountants are looking into this.
We assure you the affidavit is legitimate.

477
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:52,471
I smell fresh ink, guys.

478
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:55,391
You can prove all this?
What am I asking? Of course you can.

479
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:58,852
We have witnesses.
Grissom's signature is perfectly legitimate.

480
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:00,354
It is legitimate.

481
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:03,524
I saw it. I was there.

482
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:05,734
I saw it all.

483
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:08,821
He reached up with his dead hand...

484
00:49:08,988 --> 00:49:11,365
...and signed it in his own blood.

485
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:14,618
And he did it with this pen.

486
00:49:15,995 --> 00:49:18,580
Hello, Vinnie. It's your uncle Bingo.

487
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:22,042
Time to pay the check.

488
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:29,717
The pen...

489
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:32,052
...is truly mightier than the sword.

490
00:49:42,563 --> 00:49:43,981
Bruce!

491
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:49,611
- Wait.
- Go, get down.

492
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:13,510
Doesn't this gang war dampen the city's
plans for the 200th anniversary festival?

493
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:17,264
The festival opens. The police
are going to stop these gangsters.

494
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:19,141
What do you think the theory...

495
00:50:19,308 --> 00:50:22,644
...that the mysterious Batman
is a mob enforcer killing these people?

496
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:24,772
I don't have any comment now.

497
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:31,779
Batman.

498
00:50:32,613 --> 00:50:34,281
Batman.

499
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:39,161
Can somebody tell me
what kind of a world we live in...

500
00:50:39,328 --> 00:50:45,000
...where a man dressed up as a bat
gets all of my press?

501
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,338
This town needs an enema!

502
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:58,931
Alfred, may I have a glass of water?

503
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:02,476
I'm relieved that you're home, sir.

504
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:06,897
Miss Vale telephoned.
She was rather concerned.

505
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:10,651
I feel that there's a certain weight
that lifts when she is here.

506
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:15,197
Alfred, why don't you marry her?

507
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:19,034
That's not exactly
what I had in mind, sir.

508
00:51:22,663 --> 00:51:24,581
I know.

509
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:27,376
I can't go over that right now.

510
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:30,003
If not now...

511
00:51:32,673 --> 00:51:34,216
...when?

512
00:51:37,386 --> 00:51:39,513
I don't know.

513
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:44,977
I just found out Jack Napier's still alive.

514
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:52,109
He's running Grissom's men. I need
all the information the police have on him.

515
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:56,071
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

516
00:52:01,702 --> 00:52:03,203
Alfred.

517
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:06,832
She is great, isn't she?

518
00:52:06,999 --> 00:52:08,959
Yes, sir.

519
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,555
- City room, Knox.
- Hi.

520
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:24,099
- I want you to check something out, okay?
- Shoot.

521
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:27,644
Find out what's so special about the alley
at Pearl and Phillips streets.

522
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,771
- Corner of Pearl and Phillips?
- Yeah.

523
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:32,608
- You got it.
- Okay. Okay, bye.

524
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:42,493
Mr. Wayne.

525
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:10,437
- So much to do and so little time.
- The photos.

526
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:15,776
- Who is that loss?
- It's Knox.

527
00:53:15,943 --> 00:53:19,112
Bad tie. No style.

528
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:23,992
Stop the press. Who is that?

529
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:27,663
That's Vicki Vale. She's the photographer
who's working with Knox.

530
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:30,457
Now, that girl has style.

531
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:38,131
A lovely beast like that running around
could put steam in a man's strides.

532
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:40,592
She's dating some guy named Wayne.

533
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:43,136
She's about to trade up.

534
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:46,848
Hard to stay inside the lines.

535
00:53:50,686 --> 00:53:52,604
I'm about...

536
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:55,524
...to get a new girl, Bobby.

537
00:53:57,317 --> 00:54:00,654
I'm of a mind to make some mookie.

538
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:04,199
- Phone book.
- Yes, sir.

539
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:11,373
So much to do and so little time.

540
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:39,526
- Have you shipped a million of those?
- Yes, sir.

541
00:54:40,152 --> 00:54:45,741
Ship them all! We're going to take
them out a whole new door!

542
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:50,704
Ten seconds to transmission.

543
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:54,750
Five, four...

544
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:58,670
...three, two, one.

545
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:00,631
Cue music.

546
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:04,426
Cue Becky.

547
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:10,223
Good evening.
The fashion world was stunned today...

548
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:15,020
...by the sudden deaths of models
Candy Walker and Amanda Keeler.

549
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:19,566
Cause of death has been attributed
to a violent allergic reaction...

550
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:25,280
...although authorities have not
ruled out the possibility of drug use. Peter.

551
00:55:25,614 --> 00:55:28,533
And plans continue
for the city's 200th birthday...

552
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:31,912
...as Mayor Borg announced today
the unveiling--

553
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:34,456
This just in.

554
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:37,751
Three mysterious deaths
at a beauty parlor--

555
00:55:41,922 --> 00:55:45,342
At a beauty parlor in Gotham
were discovered today.

556
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:48,804
Barry, what the hell's going on?

557
00:55:49,221 --> 00:55:51,348
Becky, this is hardly the...

558
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,518
Becky.

559
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:57,604
- Kill the camera.
- This is Renee on the news floor.

560
00:55:57,771 --> 00:56:00,273
- I need paramedics up here now.
- Is she all right?

561
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:08,699
New and improved Joker products!

562
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:10,784
With a new secret ingredient:

563
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:12,911
Smilex.

564
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:14,579
What is this?

565
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:19,793
Now, let's go over
to our blind taste test.

566
00:56:20,544 --> 00:56:21,920
Love that Joker.

567
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:24,256
- Where is it coming from?
- I don't know.

568
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:28,677
He don't look happy.
He's been using brand X.

569
00:56:33,014 --> 00:56:35,684
But with new, improved Joker brand...

570
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:39,688
...I get a grin again and again.

571
00:56:41,273 --> 00:56:43,275
That luscious tan...

572
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:45,068
...those ruby lips...

573
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:49,990
...and hair color so natural,
only your undertaker knows for sure.

574
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:52,993
I know what you're saying:

575
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:56,538
"Where can I get
these fine, new items?"

576
00:56:56,705 --> 00:57:02,252
Well, that's the gag.
Chances are, you bought them already.

577
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:04,087
Love that Joker.

578
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:09,217
So remember, put on a happy face.

579
00:57:13,472 --> 00:57:16,600
- The information you requested, sir.
- Thank you.

580
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:27,110
"Jack Napier.
Assault with a deadly weapon, age 15.

581
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:29,863
Results of psychological profile:

582
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:34,242
Violent mood swings, highly intelligent,
emotionally unstable.

583
00:57:35,035 --> 00:57:38,330
Aptitudes includes science,
chemistry and art."

584
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:42,375
Chemistry.

585
00:57:48,507 --> 00:57:49,758
Alfred, let's go shopping.

586
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:52,219
Yes, sir.

587
00:58:00,685 --> 00:58:04,397
Six new deaths, with no clues
as to the Joker's deadly weapon.

588
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:07,901
And what is the pattern?

589
00:58:08,068 --> 00:58:12,280
Foods, alcohol
or beauty and hygiene products?

590
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:16,284
Cologne, mouthwash,
underarm deodorant?

591
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:19,746
Or worse yet, there may be no pattern.

592
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:24,000
The search goes on
through Gotham's shopping nightmare.

593
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:26,169
We are going to have a festival...

594
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:29,172
...if I have to get a shotgun
and get people there myself.

595
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:33,343
Do you hear the words coming out
of my mouth, Dent? The festival is on.

596
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:36,638
And you find out what this madman
is poisoning us with...

597
00:58:36,805 --> 00:58:39,099
...and fast. Do you read me?

598
00:58:39,808 --> 00:58:42,853
We're working on it.
I need all the help I can get.

599
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:49,276
Bruce? Hi, it's Vicki.

600
00:58:49,442 --> 00:58:52,153
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna be
10 minutes late to the museum.

601
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,948
I'll see you when I get there. Bye.

602
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:03,123
Sir, a message from Miss Vale.

603
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:05,876
She'll be 10 minutes late
in meeting you at the museum.

604
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:09,588
Okay, fine. Thank you.
Wait a minute, Alfred.

605
00:59:09,754 --> 00:59:11,715
I'm not meeting her today.

606
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:26,229
Jack, where are you going?

607
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:30,817
Daddy's going
to make some art, darling.

608
01:00:05,226 --> 01:00:07,354
Excuse me. Mr. Wayne's table?

609
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:10,398
Yes, he hasn't arrived yet.

610
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:12,776
- We have a table waiting.
- Great.

611
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:40,845
Miss Vale, this just arrived for you.

612
01:01:43,324 --> 01:01:44,951
Gentlemen...

613
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:48,747
...let's broaden our minds. Lawrence.

614
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:11,102
Give him a shave.

615
01:02:12,312 --> 01:02:14,314
Terence, brush.

616
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:10,453
The $1 bill.

617
01:03:14,082 --> 01:03:15,625
Hold it.

618
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:19,254
I kind of like this one, Bob. Leave it.

619
01:03:33,434 --> 01:03:36,396
You can take that off now, I think.

620
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:42,068
You're beautiful
in an old-fashioned kind of way.

621
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:45,697
But I'm sure we can
make you more today.

622
01:03:49,409 --> 01:03:51,953
Is that your portfolio?

623
01:03:52,412 --> 01:03:55,707
I'm meeting someone
who wants to see my work.

624
01:03:58,001 --> 01:03:59,252
Crap.

625
01:03:59,419 --> 01:04:02,088
Crap. Crap.

626
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:04,007
Crap. Crap. Crap.

627
01:04:07,594 --> 01:04:09,637
Now, that's good work.

628
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:15,476
The skulls, the bodies.

629
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:19,272
You give it all such a glow.
I don't know if it's art, but I like it.

630
01:04:21,774 --> 01:04:24,444
Let me tell you
what I'm thinking about, sweetie.

631
01:04:24,611 --> 01:04:30,825
I was in the bath one day when I realized
why I was destined for greatness.

632
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:33,953
You know how concerned people are
about appearances.

633
01:04:34,495 --> 01:04:37,207
This is attractive, that is not.

634
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:41,961
Well, that is all behind me. I now do
what other people only dream.

635
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:45,173
I make art until someone dies.

636
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:46,633
See?

637
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:52,639
I am the world's first fully
functioning homicidal artist.

638
01:04:54,474 --> 01:04:55,683
What do you want?

639
01:04:57,602 --> 01:04:59,520
My face on the $1 bill.

640
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:03,358
You must be joking.

641
01:05:04,651 --> 01:05:06,236
Do I look like I'm joking?

642
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:10,156
Listen.

643
01:05:10,323 --> 01:05:14,702
We mustn't compare ourselves
to regular people. We're artists.

644
01:05:15,078 --> 01:05:18,456
For instance, let me challenge you
with a little piece I did.

645
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:21,542
Bob. Alicia.

646
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:24,254
You will take pictures
and record my work.

647
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:28,925
You will join me in the avant-garde
of the new aesthetic.

648
01:05:29,092 --> 01:05:33,554
Jack, you said I could watch you
improve the paintings.

649
01:05:34,681 --> 01:05:36,808
I'm in trouble now.

650
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:39,018
Why is she wearing a mask?

651
01:05:40,144 --> 01:05:41,813
Well, she's just a sketch, really.

652
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:45,817
Alicia, sit down.
Show the lady why you wear the mask.

653
01:05:45,984 --> 01:05:49,862
You see, Miss Vale, Alicia's been
made over in line with my new philosophy.

654
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:54,617
So now, like me,
she is a living work of art.

655
01:05:58,705 --> 01:06:02,542
I'm no Picasso, but do you like it?

656
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:04,502
It's great.

657
01:06:04,669 --> 01:06:07,714
So, what can I do for you?

658
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:11,175
A little song, a little dance.

659
01:06:11,342 --> 01:06:13,720
Batman's head on a lance.

660
01:06:13,886 --> 01:06:16,389
Tell me, what do you know about...?

661
01:06:16,556 --> 01:06:19,726
I don't know anything about Batman.

662
01:06:19,892 --> 01:06:21,519
Really?

663
01:06:21,728 --> 01:06:25,148
Well, how about a little you and me?

664
01:06:27,275 --> 01:06:30,361
- You're insane.
- I thought I was a Pisces. Come on.

665
01:06:30,737 --> 01:06:35,325
Let's make up.
Have a little whiff of my posy.

666
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:42,790
Help me!

667
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:45,626
I'm melting!

668
01:06:45,793 --> 01:06:49,047
I'm melting! Help me! I'm melting!

669
01:06:50,923 --> 01:06:53,134
I'm melting! I'm melting!

670
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:13,696
Hold on.

671
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:25,708
Where does he get
those wonderful toys?

672
01:07:28,836 --> 01:07:30,421
- Get in the car.
- Which one?

673
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:58,092
Let's go.

674
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:14,358
Shields.

675
01:09:38,925 --> 01:09:42,428
- How much do you weigh?
- About 108, I think.

676
01:09:51,521 --> 01:09:53,231
Hold on.

677
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:05,576
See that thing on my belt? Grab it.

678
01:10:05,952 --> 01:10:08,037
Whatever you do, don't let go.

679
01:10:21,968 --> 01:10:24,637
No blood. Hey, who is this guy?

680
01:10:24,804 --> 01:10:27,515
Check his wallet.

681
01:10:27,682 --> 01:10:30,101
- Wait a minute.
- What is that?

682
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:33,980
Some kind of body armor.
He's human after all.

683
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:36,566
Take off the mask.

684
01:10:41,946 --> 01:10:43,656
Shoot her!

685
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:47,219
Shields open.

686
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:14,246
You weigh a little more than 108.

687
01:12:14,413 --> 01:12:16,290
- Oh, really?
- Let's go.

688
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:22,004
Stop.

689
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:52,618
Where are we going?

690
01:14:11,864 --> 01:14:13,616
Be careful.

691
01:14:22,249 --> 01:14:24,126
Bats.

692
01:14:25,044 --> 01:14:26,545
They're great survivors.

693
01:14:51,862 --> 01:14:54,907
- What is all this?
- The police have got it wrong.

694
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:57,743
They're looking for one product.

695
01:14:57,910 --> 01:15:01,580
The Joker's tainted hundreds
of chemicals at the source.

696
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:06,126
Then whole shipments
of products would be poisoned...

697
01:15:06,293 --> 01:15:08,254
...and we'd all be dead.

698
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:10,548
No.

699
01:15:10,756 --> 01:15:14,593
The poison only works when components
are mixed. Hair spray won't do it alone.

700
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:20,599
But hair spray mixed with lipstick and
perfume will be toxic, and then traceable.

701
01:15:20,891 --> 01:15:22,893
How did you figure this out?

702
01:15:28,983 --> 01:15:30,317
Take that to the press.

703
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:34,113
I might have some trouble with that.

704
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:38,325
A lot of people think you're
as dangerous as the Joker.

705
01:15:39,326 --> 01:15:41,245
He's psychotic.

706
01:15:42,037 --> 01:15:45,457
Some people say the same thing
about you.

707
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:47,751
What people?

708
01:15:48,127 --> 01:15:51,505
Well, I mean, let's face it.

709
01:15:51,672 --> 01:15:55,551
You're not exactly normal, are you?

710
01:15:55,718 --> 01:15:57,595
It's not exactly a normal world, is it?

711
01:15:58,012 --> 01:15:59,930
Why did you bring me here?

712
01:16:00,097 --> 01:16:03,642
I mean, you could have sent that stuff
to the press yourself.

713
01:16:04,143 --> 01:16:05,769
You're right.

714
01:16:06,770 --> 01:16:09,481
There is something else
you have that I want.

715
01:16:09,648 --> 01:16:11,150
What?

716
01:16:33,505 --> 01:16:35,925
He took the film.

717
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:41,555
- Yeah.
- Vale, where have you been?

718
01:16:41,722 --> 01:16:43,766
Are you all right?
You want me to come over?

719
01:16:44,183 --> 01:16:46,560
No. No, Allie.

720
01:16:46,727 --> 01:16:50,189
Allie, if I bring something to you,
can we make the evening edition?

721
01:16:51,857 --> 01:16:53,525
Just barely. Is it hot?

722
01:16:54,526 --> 01:16:58,072
Yeah, it's real hot. Yeah, bye.

723
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:00,741
- Copy!
- Yes, sir?

724
01:17:11,961 --> 01:17:14,463
Avoid the following combinations:

725
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:17,967
Deodorants with baby powder,
hair spray and lipstick.

726
01:17:18,801 --> 01:17:23,222
Safe products are flying in as
Gotham City goes on a forced fast.

727
01:17:23,389 --> 01:17:26,517
And all of Gotham is wondering
what to make of Batman.

728
01:17:26,684 --> 01:17:28,644
Friend or foe?

729
01:17:29,561 --> 01:17:33,273
- Meanwhile...
- I have given a name to my pain...

730
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,734
...and it is Batman.

731
01:17:40,364 --> 01:17:43,951
You must possess strength
to inflict pain, Bob.

732
01:17:44,118 --> 01:17:50,457
We've got a flying mouse to kill,
and I wanna clean my claws.

733
01:17:54,461 --> 01:17:57,339
Sir, Miss Vale called again.

734
01:17:57,506 --> 01:17:59,925
Dare I suggest that
your present course of action...

735
01:18:00,092 --> 01:18:02,845
...might simply strengthen her resolve?

736
01:18:03,429 --> 01:18:05,973
She is quite tenacious.

737
01:18:06,432 --> 01:18:07,850
You're right about that.

738
01:18:08,017 --> 01:18:10,144
And if I may say so, quite special.

739
01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:13,397
Perhaps you could try
telling her the truth.

740
01:18:22,990 --> 01:18:24,700
Coming.

741
01:18:30,289 --> 01:18:32,082
Hi.

742
01:18:38,422 --> 01:18:40,299
May I come in?

743
01:18:49,475 --> 01:18:51,643
This is a nice apartment.

744
01:18:53,479 --> 01:18:55,439
Lots of space.

745
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:05,407
- Listen, I came over to clear a few things--
- I don't know who you think you are.

746
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:07,826
- You hurt me.
- I know. Look--

747
01:19:07,993 --> 01:19:09,912
- I called you, and I called you.
- I know.

748
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:12,372
And you lied. You lied to me
about leaving town.

749
01:19:12,539 --> 01:19:14,333
- Let me tell you why.
- Let me tell you!

750
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:17,586
You invited me out. We went to dinner.
I thought we felt something.

751
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:20,506
I trusted you. I even slept with you.
I can't believe I did.

752
01:19:20,672 --> 01:19:24,176
And then you wouldn't return my calls.
You must be some kind of jerk.

753
01:19:24,343 --> 01:19:27,429
Look, you're a real nice girl,
and I like you a lot...

754
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:30,557
...but for right now, shut up.

755
01:19:30,724 --> 01:19:33,519
I have something I have to tell you.

756
01:19:40,818 --> 01:19:45,072
You know how people have
different sides to their personality?

757
01:19:46,907 --> 01:19:53,205
Sometimes a person will have
to actually lead a different life.

758
01:19:53,914 --> 01:19:55,457
Oh, my God, you're married.

759
01:19:56,083 --> 01:20:00,587
No, I'm not married.
No, that's not it.

760
01:20:05,217 --> 01:20:06,802
You see...

761
01:20:07,845 --> 01:20:10,055
...my life is really...

762
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:15,227
...complex.

763
01:20:17,604 --> 01:20:21,567
All right, listen. You know how
a normal person gets up...

764
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:25,904
...and goes downstairs...

765
01:20:26,071 --> 01:20:28,073
...eats breakfast...

766
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:34,079
...and kisses somebody goodbye
and goes to a job and...?

767
01:20:34,246 --> 01:20:36,832
- You know.
- No.

768
01:20:37,124 --> 01:20:38,876
No.

769
01:20:40,794 --> 01:20:42,045
All right, look.

770
01:20:45,757 --> 01:20:48,886
Vicki, what I'm trying to tell you is...

771
01:20:49,928 --> 01:20:54,308
- Hey, it's okay. You can tell me.
- Okay.

772
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:56,393
What?

773
01:20:59,021 --> 01:21:01,440
What I'm trying to tell you is...

774
01:21:01,607 --> 01:21:03,400
See--

775
01:21:04,026 --> 01:21:06,069
I'll be right back.

776
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:10,365
I'm Batman. I'm Batman.

777
01:21:16,788 --> 01:21:18,498
Miss me?

778
01:21:23,503 --> 01:21:27,633
Nice place you've got here.
Lots of space.

779
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:31,428
Vicki, we've really need to have a talk.

780
01:21:31,595 --> 01:21:33,722
I'm very upset.

781
01:21:34,723 --> 01:21:36,975
We were having dinner.

782
01:21:37,643 --> 01:21:41,146
I was a man doing well
with a beautiful woman.

783
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:43,815
And without so much as an apology...

784
01:21:43,982 --> 01:21:48,946
...you ran off with that sideshow phony.

785
01:21:53,325 --> 01:21:55,285
You know, Vick...

786
01:21:56,703 --> 01:21:59,706
...I've recently had a tragedy in my life.

787
01:21:59,873 --> 01:22:04,419
Alicia threw herself out of the window.

788
01:22:04,586 --> 01:22:06,672
Oh, my God.

789
01:22:08,674 --> 01:22:13,428
But you can't make an omelet
without breaking some eggs.

790
01:22:25,107 --> 01:22:26,566
Well, Miss Vale...

791
01:22:27,359 --> 01:22:29,987
...another rooster in the henhouse?

792
01:22:32,739 --> 01:22:36,285
Take thy beak from out of my heart.

793
01:22:39,496 --> 01:22:41,081
Bruce...

794
01:22:42,291 --> 01:22:46,211
Bruce Wayne, n'est-ce pas?

795
01:22:47,713 --> 01:22:49,715
Most of the time.

796
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:57,055
I know who you are.

797
01:23:00,058 --> 01:23:02,561
Let me tell you
about this guy I know, Jack.

798
01:23:03,395 --> 01:23:05,897
Mean kid. Bad seed.

799
01:23:06,064 --> 01:23:08,817
- Hurt people.
- I like him already.

800
01:23:12,529 --> 01:23:14,823
You know what the problem was?

801
01:23:15,157 --> 01:23:18,160
He got sloppy. You know, crazy.

802
01:23:18,327 --> 01:23:20,120
He started to lose it.

803
01:23:20,412 --> 01:23:22,956
He had a head full of bad wiring,
I guess.

804
01:23:23,123 --> 01:23:25,917
Couldn't keep it straight up here.

805
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:29,504
He was the kind of guy...

806
01:23:30,422 --> 01:23:34,259
...who couldn't hear the train
until it was 2 feet from him.

807
01:23:38,430 --> 01:23:40,474
You know what happened
to this guy, Jack?

808
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:44,644
Well...

809
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,731
...he made mistakes.

810
01:23:48,732 --> 01:23:49,941
Then he had his--

811
01:23:50,108 --> 01:23:51,318
His lights out!

812
01:23:51,485 --> 01:23:54,780
Now, you wanna get nuts?
Come on! Let's get nuts.

813
01:23:56,114 --> 01:23:58,450
Tell me something, my friend...

814
01:23:59,451 --> 01:24:02,788
...you ever dance with the devil
in the pale moonlight?

815
01:24:02,954 --> 01:24:06,833
- What?
- I always ask that of all my prey.

816
01:24:07,626 --> 01:24:09,378
I just like the sound of it.

817
01:24:15,634 --> 01:24:18,136
Never rub another man's rhubarb.

818
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:29,689
Why is it every time I come for you...

819
01:24:30,023 --> 01:24:32,484
...somebody always gets in the way?

820
01:24:32,651 --> 01:24:34,945
I'll need a moment alone, boys.

821
01:24:37,489 --> 01:24:40,992
I'm only laughing on the outside.

822
01:24:41,159 --> 01:24:44,663
My smile is just skin deep.

823
01:24:45,414 --> 01:24:49,501
If you could see inside,
I'm really crying.

824
01:24:50,502 --> 01:24:53,171
You might join me for a weep.

825
01:25:08,854 --> 01:25:10,856
Oh, Lord.

826
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:20,866
Oh, God.

827
01:25:37,466 --> 01:25:39,718
You wouldn't believe it.
You really wouldn't.

828
01:25:39,885 --> 01:25:42,220
Well, while you were out entertaining...

829
01:25:42,387 --> 01:25:45,557
...I've been here finding out
about your street corner.

830
01:25:46,349 --> 01:25:51,271
Vale, I think your friend Wayne
is really screwed up.

831
01:25:52,189 --> 01:25:53,940
More good news.

832
01:25:55,192 --> 01:25:56,902
Here.

833
01:26:01,907 --> 01:26:03,575
Oh, my God.

834
01:26:04,075 --> 01:26:06,411
His parents were murdered
in that alley.

835
01:26:07,245 --> 01:26:09,414
That's why he went there.

836
01:26:13,835 --> 01:26:16,838
Poor kid watched the whole thing
happen in front of him.

837
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:18,840
Look at the look on the face.

838
01:26:19,508 --> 01:26:21,760
It was the same in front of City Hall.

839
01:26:23,428 --> 01:26:25,931
What do you suppose something
like this does to a kid?

840
01:26:30,143 --> 01:26:31,770
Vale.

841
01:26:31,937 --> 01:26:33,855
Don't get personal.

842
01:26:45,951 --> 01:26:49,996
Alfred, did you get
the file on my parents?

843
01:26:50,455 --> 01:26:52,040
It's on your table, sir.

844
01:26:52,874 --> 01:26:54,501
Thank you.

845
01:27:00,799 --> 01:27:02,676
What's on your mind, Alfred?

846
01:27:04,553 --> 01:27:08,890
I have no wish to fill
my few remaining years...

847
01:27:09,057 --> 01:27:11,434
...grieving for the loss of old friends.

848
01:27:15,647 --> 01:27:17,107
Or their sons.

849
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:40,630
The 200th anniversary birthday gala
has been indefinitely postponed.

850
01:27:40,797 --> 01:27:43,008
We simply cannot guarantee
public safety--

851
01:27:43,174 --> 01:27:44,718
Joker here.

852
01:27:44,884 --> 01:27:46,636
We got interference.
Call the OB unit.

853
01:27:46,803 --> 01:27:50,265
Now, you fellas have said
some pretty mean things.

854
01:27:50,432 --> 01:27:55,353
Some of which were true
under that fiend, Boss Grissom.

855
01:27:55,770 --> 01:27:58,565
He was a thief and a terrorist.

856
01:27:58,732 --> 01:28:02,360
On the other hand, he had
a tremendous singing voice.

857
01:28:02,611 --> 01:28:06,865
He's dead now,
and he's left me in charge.

858
01:28:07,866 --> 01:28:11,286
Now, I can be theatrical...

859
01:28:11,453 --> 01:28:15,040
...and maybe even a little rough.

860
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:19,753
But one thing I am not is a killer.

861
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:23,006
I'm an artist.

862
01:28:23,214 --> 01:28:25,925
I love a good party.

863
01:28:26,092 --> 01:28:28,345
So truce.

864
01:28:32,724 --> 01:28:36,394
And I've got a surprise
for Gotham City.

865
01:28:36,895 --> 01:28:43,026
At midnight, I will dump 20 million
in cash on the crowd.

866
01:28:45,945 --> 01:28:48,573
Don't worry about me.
I've got enough.

867
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:51,409
We are not prepared
to discuss any deals.

868
01:28:54,037 --> 01:28:56,414
You heard it, folks, 20 million.

869
01:28:57,248 --> 01:28:59,376
And there will be entertainment.

870
01:28:59,834 --> 01:29:04,255
The big duke-a-roo. With me in one corner
and in the other corner...

871
01:29:04,964 --> 01:29:11,221
...the man who has brought real terror
to Gotham City. Batman.

872
01:29:11,721 --> 01:29:13,431
Can you hear me?

873
01:29:13,932 --> 01:29:17,560
Just the two of us, mano a mano.

874
01:29:18,645 --> 01:29:20,939
I have taken off my makeup.

875
01:29:22,023 --> 01:29:27,195
Let's see if you can take off yours.

876
01:31:38,993 --> 01:31:41,037
Tell me, kid...

877
01:31:41,204 --> 01:31:46,000
...you ever dance with the devil
by the pale moonlight?

878
01:31:53,883 --> 01:31:55,635
Man, let's go!

879
01:31:58,263 --> 01:32:00,098
Let's go, Jack!

880
01:32:03,643 --> 01:32:06,020
See you around, kid.

881
01:32:24,622 --> 01:32:25,874
Thanks.

882
01:32:31,796 --> 01:32:33,631
Hi.

883
01:32:34,924 --> 01:32:36,551
Tell me if I'm crazy...

884
01:32:39,053 --> 01:32:42,640
...but that wasn't just another night
for either of us, was it?

885
01:32:44,309 --> 01:32:49,480
I mean, we both got to each other,
didn't we?

886
01:32:51,774 --> 01:32:54,485
Why won't you let me in?

887
01:32:54,652 --> 01:32:56,446
Why?

888
01:32:59,324 --> 01:33:00,992
You got in.

889
01:33:05,705 --> 01:33:08,124
I've loved you since I met you.

890
01:33:09,125 --> 01:33:12,670
But I don't know what to think of all this.
I really don't.

891
01:33:12,837 --> 01:33:15,632
Look, sometimes I don't know what
to think about this.

892
01:33:15,798 --> 01:33:19,177
- It's just something I have to do.
- Why?

893
01:33:19,427 --> 01:33:21,512
Because nobody else can.

894
01:33:22,764 --> 01:33:27,602
Look, I tried to avoid all this,
but I can't.

895
01:33:27,810 --> 01:33:29,854
This is how it is.

896
01:33:30,355 --> 01:33:32,190
It's not a perfect world.

897
01:33:32,690 --> 01:33:35,401
It doesn't have to be a perfect world.

898
01:33:39,405 --> 01:33:43,701
I just gotta know,
are we gonna try to love each other?

899
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:48,581
I'd like to.

900
01:33:50,041 --> 01:33:52,251
But he's out there right now...

901
01:33:52,418 --> 01:33:54,420
...and I've gotta go to work.

902
01:35:36,773 --> 01:35:39,067
Into the air, Junior Birdman!

903
01:35:39,233 --> 01:35:41,277
Missed me!

904
01:35:41,986 --> 01:35:43,988
Yeah! Watch me!

905
01:38:05,213 --> 01:38:07,757
Get them. Take the pictures.

906
01:38:08,966 --> 01:38:10,218
Gotham's greed.

907
01:38:38,871 --> 01:38:40,790
And now, folks...

908
01:38:40,957 --> 01:38:43,376
...it's time for "Who Do You Trust?"

909
01:38:43,542 --> 01:38:46,170
Money, money, money! Who do you trust?

910
01:38:46,337 --> 01:38:49,674
Me? I'm giving away free money.

911
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:53,719
And where is the Batman?

912
01:38:54,345 --> 01:38:57,682
He's at home, washing his tights.

913
01:39:05,481 --> 01:39:09,777
Winged battle flies through the night
and finds me ready.

914
01:39:09,944 --> 01:39:12,280
Bob, mask.

915
01:39:12,947 --> 01:39:15,658
- Mask! Put them on now!
- Right.

916
01:39:15,825 --> 01:39:20,746
And now comes the part...

917
01:39:20,913 --> 01:39:23,541
...where I relieve you, the little people...

918
01:39:23,708 --> 01:39:28,087
...of the burden of your failed
and useless lives.

919
01:39:28,254 --> 01:39:31,090
But as my plastic surgeon always said:

920
01:39:31,257 --> 01:39:35,052
"If you gotta go, go with a smile."

921
01:40:06,417 --> 01:40:09,420
Oh, my God. Smilex gas.

922
01:40:09,879 --> 01:40:11,922
- He's gonna kill everybody!
- Get in the car.

923
01:40:12,089 --> 01:40:14,508
- No, no!
- Get in the car!

924
01:40:22,808 --> 01:40:24,352
Hurry!

925
01:41:34,505 --> 01:41:35,798
Vale!

926
01:41:43,305 --> 01:41:45,224
Hey, hey! No, no, no!

927
01:42:15,463 --> 01:42:16,881
My balloons.

928
01:42:27,391 --> 01:42:28,851
Those are my balloons.

929
01:42:55,878 --> 01:42:58,506
He stole my balloons!

930
01:42:58,923 --> 01:43:03,302
Why didn't somebody tell me
that he had one of those things?

931
01:43:04,678 --> 01:43:06,847
Bob, gun.

932
01:43:13,145 --> 01:43:15,731
Going to need a minute
or two alone, boys.

933
01:43:15,940 --> 01:43:17,942
Come on, get out of here!

934
01:44:10,244 --> 01:44:13,831
Come on, you gruesome son of a bitch.
Come to me.

935
01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:16,834
Come on.

936
01:45:51,261 --> 01:45:52,805
Darling.

937
01:45:54,723 --> 01:45:57,434
I've got to get you to the church
on time.

938
01:46:01,647 --> 01:46:03,190
Yes, sir.

939
01:46:03,357 --> 01:46:06,777
Gotham City Cathedral.
Transportation for two.

940
01:46:06,944 --> 01:46:08,862
- Right away, sir?
- Five minutes.

941
01:46:09,029 --> 01:46:10,447
Five minutes.

942
01:46:14,785 --> 01:46:18,372
- Better make it 10.
- Okay, 10 minutes.

943
01:48:18,242 --> 01:48:20,285
All right, let's go, men. Let's go.

944
01:48:53,068 --> 01:48:55,195
You men go that way. Follow me.

945
01:49:48,123 --> 01:49:49,583
Let's go.

946
01:49:56,965 --> 01:50:00,677
You men point those searchlights
up on the tower right now. Move! Move!

947
01:50:30,916 --> 01:50:35,629
It can be truly said
that I have a bat in my belfry.

948
01:50:44,096 --> 01:50:46,056
Shall we dance?

949
01:52:07,429 --> 01:52:13,351
You know, without you,
I just wouldn't wanna go on.

950
01:53:36,852 --> 01:53:39,729
It's as though we were made
for each other.

951
01:53:39,896 --> 01:53:42,816
Beauty and the beast.

952
01:53:42,983 --> 01:53:48,613
Of course, if anyone else calls you "beast,”
I'll rip their lungs out.

953
01:54:18,977 --> 01:54:20,604
Mr. Joker...

954
01:54:24,107 --> 01:54:26,860
...you say such beautiful things.

955
01:54:28,278 --> 01:54:31,323
And you're so powerful and purple!

956
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:35,785
Oh, I love purple.

957
01:54:37,704 --> 01:54:39,289
Excuse me.

958
01:54:39,456 --> 01:54:42,125
You ever dance with the devil
in the pale moonlight?

959
01:54:46,463 --> 01:54:48,465
I'm going to kill you.

960
01:54:48,632 --> 01:54:50,425
You idiot!

961
01:54:50,592 --> 01:54:52,802
You made me, remember?

962
01:54:52,969 --> 01:54:54,846
You dropped me
into that vat of chemicals.

963
01:54:55,263 --> 01:54:59,392
That wasn't easy to get over.
And don't think that I didn't try.

964
01:54:59,601 --> 01:55:00,894
I know you did.

965
01:55:28,838 --> 01:55:30,215
You killed my parents.

966
01:55:30,548 --> 01:55:31,883
What?

967
01:55:33,843 --> 01:55:35,428
What are you talking about?

968
01:55:35,595 --> 01:55:38,098
I made you. You made me first.

969
01:55:38,265 --> 01:55:41,309
Hey, bat-brain, I mean, I was a kid
when I killed your parents.

970
01:55:41,476 --> 01:55:44,020
When I say, "I made you,"
you gotta say, "You made me."

971
01:55:44,187 --> 01:55:46,731
I mean, how childish can you get?

972
01:55:46,898 --> 01:55:49,484
You wouldn't hit a guy
with glasses on, would you?

973
01:56:05,750 --> 01:56:07,919
What are you laughing at?

974
01:56:14,759 --> 01:56:16,845
Here, let me lend you a hand.

975
01:56:24,936 --> 01:56:26,271
Lend you a hand.

976
01:56:33,862 --> 01:56:36,573
They don't make them like they used to!

977
01:56:38,700 --> 01:56:42,579
Do they, hey? Hey, Batsy?

978
01:56:55,633 --> 01:56:57,385
There he is! Down there!

979
01:56:57,594 --> 01:56:59,262
Go down!

980
01:57:10,315 --> 01:57:12,650
Well, it's time to retire.

981
01:57:14,444 --> 01:57:16,696
Feel free to drop in.

982
01:57:26,081 --> 01:57:29,376
Sometimes I just kill myself!

983
01:57:32,462 --> 01:57:35,256
- Come on. Now.
- Hold on!

984
01:57:55,568 --> 01:57:58,446
Come on! Come on!

985
01:59:46,262 --> 01:59:50,767
Our police have rounded up
all the Joker's men.

986
01:59:50,934 --> 01:59:53,645
The reign of crime is over.

987
01:59:53,811 --> 01:59:57,273
Public safety in Gotham City
is no longer a laughing matter.

988
01:59:57,440 --> 02:00:00,026
Hey, Vale, aren't you covering
this press conference?

989
02:00:00,193 --> 02:00:01,277
Nope.

990
02:00:01,444 --> 02:00:03,780
Well, what about our Pulitzer Prize?

991
02:00:03,947 --> 02:00:05,865
What about us?

992
02:00:06,366 --> 02:00:08,826
What about your picture of Batman?

993
02:00:16,834 --> 02:00:18,753
Take care, Allie.

994
02:00:20,797 --> 02:00:23,466
We've received a letter
from Batman this morning.

995
02:00:25,593 --> 02:00:28,137
"Please inform the citizens of Gotham...

996
02:00:28,304 --> 02:00:31,140
...that Gotham City's earned
a rest from crime.

997
02:00:32,100 --> 02:00:35,603
But if the forces of evil
should rise again...

998
02:00:35,770 --> 02:00:38,648
...to cast a shadow
on the heart of the city...

999
02:00:39,148 --> 02:00:40,483
...call me."

1000
02:00:40,650 --> 02:00:42,110
Question:

1001
02:00:42,318 --> 02:00:44,237
How do we call him?

1002
02:00:48,658 --> 02:00:50,285
He gave us a signal.

1003
02:01:26,112 --> 02:01:29,032
I thought champagne
would be in order, ma'am.

1004
02:01:29,198 --> 02:01:30,867
Hi, Alfred.

1005
02:01:39,667 --> 02:01:43,630
Mr. Wayne told me to tell you
that he might be a little late.

1006
02:01:46,591 --> 02:01:48,760
I'm not a bit surprised.
