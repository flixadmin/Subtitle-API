1
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:06,261
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:09,926
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

3
00:00:10,092 --> 00:00:13,141
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

4
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:16,274
I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.

5
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:18,690
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

6
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:21,775
but in doing so,
I opened up our world to new threats.

7
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:25,242
And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

8
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:27,777
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:28,736 --> 00:00:30,535
Previously, on The Flash...

10
00:00:30,696 --> 00:00:31,743
Why are you here?

11
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:34,706
Because I wanna go faster,
and you're the only one who can teach me.

12
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,962
Everything you need is on this drive.

13
00:00:37,161 --> 00:00:39,164
It means a lot. You looking after Barry.

14
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:41,628
Barry's not the only person here
I want to keep safe.

15
00:00:43,417 --> 00:00:45,261
We found Barry's double,
so where the hell am I?

16
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,093
Reverb.

17
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:49,384
You don't even know how powerful you are.

18
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:51,685
His name is Hunter Zolomon.

19
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:54,517
I thought that if I could
find my doppelganger on this earth,

20
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:57,649
I could replace my damaged cells
with some of his healthy ones.

21
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:58,808
I've been vibing Zoom.

22
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,277
And every time it's happened,
I've been near that thing.

23
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:02,774
I saw Jay.

24
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:04,281
He's Zoom.

25
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:09,078
Sometimes, terrible things
happen to us when we 're children.

26
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:12,993
Things that can define who we become,
whether we want them to or not.

27
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,203
Mom!

28
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:15,659
Run, Barry, run!

29
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:17,585
Some of us become stronger.

30
00:01:17,743 --> 00:01:22,341
The people who took me in helped me heal,
and move past everything that happened.

31
00:01:22,498 --> 00:01:25,093
They're responsible
for who I've become today.

32
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,379
But I know that I'm one of the lucky ones.

33
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:28,546
Come on, Barry.

34
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:30,682
Not everyone gets
that kind of support.

35
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:33,264
Without it, ldon't know
where I would've ended up.

36
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,975
Or what I could have become.

37
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:42,686
James.

38
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:44,400
Who do you think you are?

39
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:47,198
Do you know
what I went through over there?

40
00:01:47,356 --> 00:01:50,360
Do you know the sacrifices I made for you?

41
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:53,992
I come back after years of fighting
for this country

42
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:56,375
and this is my welcome home?

43
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,245
You think you can walk out on me?

44
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:00,753
I'm your husband!

45
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,459
You're not my husband.

46
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,546
I don't know what you are right now.

47
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,378
I am a hero, Ashley!

48
00:02:07,543 --> 00:02:09,921
No, you're a monster.

49
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,723
Run, Hunter. Run!

50
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:14,509
Stay, boy!

51
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,736
Hey, it's okay.

52
00:02:26,687 --> 00:02:27,905
Come on.

53
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:30,783
- Please. Please don't do this...
- Shut up!

54
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:34,537
No, please! No, please! No, no...

55
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:41,829
No, please! No, please! No, no...

56
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,542
You're gonna wanna see this, son.

57
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:46,462
No... No. James!

58
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:50,466
Please. No, James.

59
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:51,754
No.

60
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,885
No. James!

61
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:55,884
ASHLEYI No!

62
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,037
Name?

63
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:21,705
Hunter Zolomon.

64
00:03:21,867 --> 00:03:25,122
Father killed the mother.
Kid saw the whole thing.

65
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,460
Next of kin?

66
00:03:26,622 --> 00:03:28,500
No relatives wanted him.

67
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,294
He is all alone.

68
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,804
Follow me.

69
00:03:34,463 --> 00:03:36,182
And don't dawdle.

70
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,448
Okay, you guys, I'm here.

71
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:00,911
You got my location?

72
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,326
You good? You don't need to,
like, stretch or somethin?

73
00:04:03,492 --> 00:04:04,914
No, no, no, I'm good, I'm good.

74
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,671
Let's take this tachyon enhancer
out for test drive.

75
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,174
All right.

76
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,796
Ooh, yeah, I feel that.

77
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:16,514
That is the tachyon device

78
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,391
powering up the Speed Force in your cells
like a quick-charge battery.

79
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,598
- How do you feel?
- Different.

80
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:24,355
Let's see how long it takes for you
to get back here. On my count.

81
00:04:26,932 --> 00:04:30,062
Three, two, one. Go!

82
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,742
Dang. This thing got you cruisin'.

83
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:38,199
How fast does he normally go?

84
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,362
Not this fast.

85
00:04:39,528 --> 00:04:41,997
Not even close. Are his vitals okay?

86
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:43,249
Yeah, they're perfect.

87
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:48,497
Cool. It's like having a pit-stop
attached to your chest.

88
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,007
Guys. I can go faster.

89
00:04:57,004 --> 00:04:58,221
Do it.

90
00:05:10,726 --> 00:05:14,072
I'm... I'm back. I'm back.

91
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:16,651
What if... How long was I gone?

92
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:19,946
Let's put it this way.
You just annihilated your old record.

93
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:23,240
Yeah, you went four times faster
than you have ever been.

94
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,952
"Four times"?

95
00:05:25,574 --> 00:05:26,997
- That's as...
- As fast as Zoom.

96
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:30,706
Well, faster. Actually.

97
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:35,502
Hey, uh, do we think that
we can get this thing smaller?

98
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:36,716
It kind of sucks.

99
00:05:36,877 --> 00:05:39,471
If it sucks, then yeah.

100
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:46,021
All right, so now all we have to do
is figure out how to get back to Zoom.

101
00:05:46,178 --> 00:05:48,601
Yes, uh, just a minor issue.

102
00:05:48,764 --> 00:05:51,439
We closed all the breaches
and have no idea how to reopen them.

103
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,153
We're... Wells?

104
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,939
Yeah, I have an idea, Allen.
Let's keep the breaches closed forever.

105
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:57,903
Forget about the breaches,
forget about Zoom.

106
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,069
Wait, I'm sorry, lthought that
you were on board with this.

107
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:02,829
No. No.

108
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:05,161
I said I would help you get faster.

109
00:06:05,322 --> 00:06:07,745
I did not say I would help you
give the man who kidnapped my daughter

110
00:06:07,908 --> 00:06:09,627
and tortured her a chance to do it again.

111
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:12,084
Hey, we are not gonna let that happen.

112
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:14,545
Oh, you're not gonna let that happen.

113
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,175
Gosh, lwish I'd known that
the first time.

114
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,927
You don't understand.

115
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,463
Zoom is different than us.

116
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:22,302
Zoom is not tied to anything.

117
00:06:22,464 --> 00:06:25,093
Zoom does not care for anyone.

118
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:26,432
I do.

119
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:28,814
My daughter's out here on
this earth somewhere, I have to find her.

120
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,814
We all have people that we care about.

121
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:33,978
Zoom will use that against us. Believe me.

122
00:06:37,062 --> 00:06:38,439
Maybe we should just leave it be.

123
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,404
No, no. Look, no, look we're...

124
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,444
We're not turning our backs
on another earth.

125
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,240
We're not gonna let Zoom get away
with everything that he's done.

126
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:50,000
Right now, there is no way
to another earth, Allen.

127
00:06:51,827 --> 00:06:53,829
Let's keep it that way.

128
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:59,552
We're getting back to Earth-2.

129
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:01,805
With or without his help.

130
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,589
Let's go to work.

131
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,641
Hey, where you goin?

132
00:07:08,802 --> 00:07:10,555
We could use your help.

133
00:07:10,846 --> 00:07:15,478
Uh, yeah, I would, it'sjust,
I have a date with Scott.

134
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:17,019
That's the editor?

135
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:18,608
Yeah. Yeah.

136
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:21,567
That's good. No, I'm glad that
you're finding a way to move on

137
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,860
without anything holding you back.
You deserve that.

138
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:26,495
Yeah, I... Well, lwouldn't have been
able to do it without your support.

139
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:28,952
- Means a lot to me, so...
- Of course.

140
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,242
- Thanks.
- Yes, for sure.

141
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:36,048
Well, hey, I mean, if you don't get
this breach problem fixed by tonight,

142
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:37,457
pencil me in for tomorrow.

143
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,091
I can do that.

144
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,127
Okay.

145
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,470
Man, I love it when you train

146
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,230
- in Keystone City.
- Mmm-hmm.

147
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:53,560
Hey, you sticking around after dinner?

148
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:56,396
Me and Wally are gonna watch Formula One.

149
00:07:56,558 --> 00:07:57,560
Mmm.

150
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:59,146
No, I can't.

151
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,403
I gotta get back to the lab.

152
00:08:00,562 --> 00:08:02,189
I'm still trying to find
a way back to Earth-2.

153
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:03,653
Can't you just stick Wells on it?

154
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,238
No, he refused.

155
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:08,906
Doesn't want me or anybody
opening the breaches again.

156
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,288
Well, I can't believe I'm saying this

157
00:08:10,447 --> 00:08:12,666
about a man I shot at
and punched in the face,

158
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,543
but I think you should listen to him.

159
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:15,920
Why?

160
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,295
Barry, it worries the hell out of me,

161
00:08:17,454 --> 00:08:19,331
the thought that you wanna
go back to Earth-2.

162
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,718
I'm faster now,
I'm faster than I've ever been.

163
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,595
Faster than Zoom.

164
00:08:25,295 --> 00:08:26,593
I can take him down.

165
00:08:27,214 --> 00:08:29,843
All I'm saying is, you already
escaped the hornet's nest once.

166
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,387
Why go back and kick it again?

167
00:08:33,303 --> 00:08:34,304
Hey.

168
00:08:34,471 --> 00:08:38,442
Wally. We got some pizza here
all the way from Keystone City.

169
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,602
Hope it's cool, I brought my laundry over.

170
00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:42,772
Of course. Barry used to
do his laundry here all the time

171
00:08:42,938 --> 00:08:44,030
when he was in college.

172
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,989
That's 'cause those machines in the dorm
always eat your quarters, right?

173
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:49,404
Actually, I'm not
livin' on campus anymore.

174
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:51,288
What? Since when?

175
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:54,748
Since room and board
became way more expensive than I thought.

176
00:08:54,908 --> 00:08:57,037
Man, I can help you out with that.

177
00:08:57,202 --> 00:08:58,294
I mean, I figured your money

178
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:00,456
must be tight after payin'
all your mother's medical bills.

179
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,715
How much more is it?

180
00:09:04,793 --> 00:09:06,171
No, it's, uh... It's cool.

181
00:09:06,336 --> 00:09:07,589
Come on, Wally, let me help you out.

182
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:10,679
Plus I got that mini-fridge in the garage.
You can use that, too, if you want.

183
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,309
Joe, I'm good, really.

184
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,471
All right.

185
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,767
Uh, let me just put these in real quick.

186
00:09:20,934 --> 00:09:23,984
Man, I can't figure
that kid out sometimes.

187
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,984
I wonder if his doppelganger's
that complicated.

188
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,499
Hey.

189
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,159
Wow. Um...

190
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:38,374
Any ideas?

191
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:41,414
Well, the best plan
we've come up with so far

192
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,835
is to set off a nuclear warhead
next to the city's electrical grid. So...

193
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,466
We're not gonna do that. Um...

194
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,927
I think I thought of something, though.

195
00:09:52,424 --> 00:09:55,269
Tell me everything that you know
about Cisco's doppelganger.

196
00:09:55,427 --> 00:09:56,428
Reverb?

197
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,144
What were Reverb's powers on your earth?

198
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:02,981
Well, he could tap into the
multi-dimensional energies between earths.

199
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,692
He could see through dimensions,
find breachers.

200
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:06,902
Like Ramon.

201
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,317
I mean, we saw Reverb
do more than that, though, right?

202
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:13,205
I mean, we saw him
shoot vibrational bursts out of his hands.

203
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:14,831
Really painful ones.

204
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,036
What do you mean?

205
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,418
I... I mean, Reverb had the ability

206
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:21,705
to somehow manipulate
that multi-dimensional energy.

207
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:22,871
What's your point, Allen?

208
00:10:23,038 --> 00:10:25,667
My point is, if his powers are linked

209
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,837
to the energy
that ties together the multi-verse

210
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,629
and he can manipulate it?

211
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,048
Then he can open a breach

212
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:33,761
- to any earth he wants.
- Exactly.

213
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:37,679
And if Reverb could do it,
I could do it, too.

214
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:42,812
Cisco, lthink that
the way back to Earth-2, is you.

215
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,494
I got nothin'.

216
00:10:56,655 --> 00:10:57,908
Try again. okay?

217
00:10:58,073 --> 00:11:00,418
Barry, what if he can't do it
because he thinks he can't do it?

218
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,671
He can do it, though. You can do it.

219
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:16,721
You... It's gonna work, okay? And it...

220
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,729
Maybe we're just not in the right place.

221
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:23,312
Or maybe I'm just not
the right man for the job, right?

222
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:24,520
Let's go.

223
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:25,775
Cisco.

224
00:11:27,102 --> 00:11:28,775
I'm sorry, Barry.

225
00:11:31,481 --> 00:11:33,109
It's gonna work.

226
00:11:42,534 --> 00:11:43,912
Detective.

227
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,120
Um...

228
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:46,789
I need to ask you a...

229
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,466
You've got company.

230
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:50,842
- Um...
- No, it's cool.

231
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,548
I should be studying anyway.

232
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,182
You know, you kind of look like that guy.

233
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:57,341
I'm not him.

234
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:58,804
Okay.

235
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,187
Later, Joe.

236
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,100
Well.

237
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:17,325
Thank you. Uh, look, I apologize
for droppin' by unannounced.

238
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:18,783
I just...

239
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,995
Have you had any luck
locating my daughter?

240
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:23,326
Not yet.

241
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:26,496
But I've circulated her picture
through every department in the region.

242
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:29,006
And I've reached out
to some friends in Keystone.

243
00:12:29,164 --> 00:12:30,633
She's smart.

244
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,177
She's gonna know
how to stay hidden. She's...

245
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:34,678
We'll find her.

246
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,338
Right.

247
00:12:36,838 --> 00:12:39,638
There's another thing also, Detective.

248
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:41,018
A favor.

249
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:48,186
I would ask you to talk Barry out of
reopening the breaches to my earth.

250
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,482
I can't do that.

251
00:12:55,649 --> 00:13:00,155
No, you can find a way to change his mind.

252
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:02,539
For both our children's sakes.

253
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:07,792
Look, I think it's just as dumb as you do,

254
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,003
but I learned a long time ago,
I can't talk Barry out of anything

255
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,587
once he sets his mind to it.

256
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,345
Zoom is terrorizing
this other world, your world.

257
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:19,552
He can't let it go.

258
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,811
But look, why don't you do me a favor?

259
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:26,306
Go with Barry.

260
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,148
Help him.

261
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,433
Help him?

262
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:32,903
Why would I do that?

263
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:38,114
Because he's got a much better chance
of defeating Zoom if you're involved.

264
00:13:45,073 --> 00:13:47,201
This area has the highest levels

265
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,412
of residual trans-dimensional energy.

266
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:52,081
You should be able to
open the breach that used to be here.

267
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,923
It's right here. This is it.

268
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,346
For real?
In this Patch Adams nightmare, right here?

269
00:13:59,504 --> 00:14:01,052
- Yeah.
- Love it.

270
00:14:01,923 --> 00:14:03,267
All right.

271
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:06,019
Look, dude, if this doesn't work,

272
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:08,852
I'll stop asking you
to do this, all right?

273
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:10,432
Okay.

274
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,571
Yeah.

275
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:23,202
What?

276
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,740
I can't do it.

277
00:14:26,698 --> 00:14:28,167
That's right.

278
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:29,789
You can't.

279
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,080
What are you doing here? You said...

280
00:14:32,245 --> 00:14:33,963
I know what I said.

281
00:14:34,664 --> 00:14:36,042
But you're not gonna stop, are you?

282
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:38,342
No.

283
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,504
Okay, Barry Allen,
then I'm gonna do what I can

284
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,264
to make sure you don't get killed.

285
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:47,682
I recalibrated these to the
electromagnetic frequency of this earth.

286
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,721
It should help you access enough

287
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:53,438
of the trans-dimensional energy
to manipulate it.

288
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,438
Just like Reverb,

289
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:00,448
all I'm missing is the guyliner
and the transformation's complete.

290
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,244
Take 'em out for a spin.

291
00:15:36,184 --> 00:15:37,731
It's working.

292
00:15:53,952 --> 00:15:56,375
Keep coming, Cisco. Keep comin'.

293
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,339
It's working.

294
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,226
Hey, what happened? You were doin' it.

295
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,736
- No, no, no, no. I can't do this.
- What?

296
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,067
I can't. Don't.

297
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,732
Please. Don't ask me to do this.

298
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,116
Please.

299
00:16:31,823 --> 00:16:33,201
Hey, what do we got?

300
00:16:33,366 --> 00:16:35,870
It's your tachyon absorption
enhancer upgrade.

301
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:38,289
Retrofitted for when it was used
to steal your speed

302
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:40,834
to now give you more of it.

303
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:43,090
Almost done.

304
00:16:43,251 --> 00:16:44,423
That's amazing, thank you.

305
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:45,963
You're welcome.

306
00:16:46,129 --> 00:16:47,427
Hey, is Cisco back yet?

307
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,307
- Have we seen him?
- I haven't seen him.

308
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:50,592
Check his workshop.

309
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,511
Yeah, all right.

310
00:16:52,677 --> 00:16:54,100
- Hey.
- Hey.

311
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,063
We just came by to see if you guys
needed some help.

312
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:00,691
- Uh, sure.
- Oh. Yeah.

313
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:02,109
We can always use an extra set of hands.

314
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:04,898
- Do you want to help me in the med bay?
- Yeah.

315
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:06,825
- Some advice?
- Huh.

316
00:17:06,983 --> 00:17:08,611
- This whole Wally thing?
- Uh-huh?

317
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:11,076
He's not letting me help him.

318
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:14,288
It's probably 'cause you're not offering
the right kind of help.

319
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,124
Wally doesn't want your help
payin' for a place to live.

320
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:20,130
He wants you to offer him a place to live.

321
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:23,134
- Why didn't he just say that?
- I don't know.

322
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,420
- So he does wanna live in our house?
- Yeah, man.

323
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,634
Look, Wally's never
lived with his father before,

324
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:30,299
and trust me, that is a big deal.

325
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,851
- You're good with it?
- Mmm-hmm.

326
00:17:33,009 --> 00:17:35,637
I mean, you know it's been you and me
for so long, and I love that.

327
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:37,147
But having Wally around will be cool, too.

328
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,980
Just, we won't get
to have as much pizza from Keystone.

329
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,895
Yeah, it kind of sucks. I'm sorry.

330
00:17:43,061 --> 00:17:44,779
I better get used to that.

331
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:48,785
They really have a special bond,
don't they?

332
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,987
Yeah, they sure do.

333
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,156
Are you okay?

334
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,576
I don't know what I am.

335
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:01,664
Last night I was supposed to go on a date.

336
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,253
My first real date since Eddie died.

337
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,921
But at the last second, I just...
I couldn't do it.

338
00:18:08,336 --> 00:18:10,759
Is that because of Eddie
or because of Barry?

339
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,678
I've noticed the way
you've been looking at him recently.

340
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:16,221
Is it that obvious?

341
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:18,480
Only to a woman who's been through
the same thing.

342
00:18:18,638 --> 00:18:22,269
Everything seems to be telling me
that Barry and I are meant to be together.

343
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,403
I mean, on Earth-2 we're married.

344
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:27,361
In the future, we're supposedly married.

345
00:18:27,522 --> 00:18:29,445
And now that I'm finally ready to move on,

346
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,282
I Just wonder
if that should be with Barry.

347
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:35,073
Everything seems to be
pointing in that direction.

348
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:37,540
D0 you believe in destiny, Caitlin?

349
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,914
Maybe for you.

350
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,590
Hello?

351
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:50,675
Joe?

352
00:18:50,837 --> 00:18:52,556
Wally, I'm up here.

353
00:18:56,551 --> 00:18:58,019
- Hey.
- What are you doin?

354
00:18:58,179 --> 00:18:59,226
It's not done, yet.

355
00:18:59,387 --> 00:19:01,560
I mean, you can decorate it how you like.
Make it your own.

356
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:03,771
Wait, wait, Joe, what is this?

357
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,605
Wally, forgive me.

358
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:10,741
When Barry and Iris went to college,
they couldn't get away fast enough.

359
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,028
They wanted nothing to do
with their old man.

360
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:17,074
It didn't even occur to me
that you might feel differently.

361
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:21,537
It's embarrassing,
but it took Barry to help me see that.

362
00:19:21,701 --> 00:19:26,252
So if you still haven't found
a place to live, live here.

363
00:19:26,539 --> 00:19:30,214
Imean, it's yours. If you want to.

364
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:32,759
You're serious?

365
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,972
Look, I'm not gonna do your laundry,

366
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,599
and I'm not washing dishes after you...

367
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,886
and this bed is gonna be made
every morning before you leave,

368
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:42,102
and there will be no beer in that fridge,
but, yeah.

369
00:19:42,263 --> 00:19:43,516
It's yours.

370
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,439
When can I move in?

371
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,438
Whenever you want.

372
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,740
All right.

373
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,782
Thanks, Dad.

374
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:03,619
Hey, man.

375
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,710
Look, um...

376
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,347
I know what it's like.

377
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:18,009
Zoom, getting in your head.

378
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:21,098
How scary that can be.

379
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:26,683
It's not Zoom.

380
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:29,319
It's me.

381
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,320
What do you mean, it's you?

382
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:35,067
It's like, right now I'm Anakin Skywalker.

383
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:38,238
I've got the midi-chlorians,
I've got the goods,

384
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,247
the Force is strong with me.

385
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,078
That is something I can feel.

386
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,165
But if I start opening breaches
into other worlds,

387
00:20:46,327 --> 00:20:49,457
doing all this other crazy stuff
Reverb was doing, then,

388
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,670
what if this is how I become Vader?

389
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:55,087
Dude, you're never gonna become Vader.

390
00:20:55,253 --> 00:20:56,255
But you don't know that.

391
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:58,015
That is what happened to Reverb.

392
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:02,019
He learned how to use his abilities,
and when he felt that...

393
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:08,109
When he felt that power,
he succumbed to the dark side.

394
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,364
Look, I get it. I... I really do.

395
00:21:13,521 --> 00:21:15,694
Every time I've learned a new ability,

396
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:18,406
I've been terrified about
what it might mean for me,

397
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:20,696
what it could do to me, you know?

398
00:21:21,946 --> 00:21:26,702
But you were there with me
when I learned how to run on water.

399
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:31,333
When I ran up a building
or traveled through time.

400
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:35,339
Just like I'm going to be there
every step of the way with you.

401
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:40,092
You got something that Reverb never had,

402
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:43,727
and that's Caitlin and Joe
and Iris and Wells and me.

403
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:46,138
Friends who are gonna look out for you.

404
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,557
And we're more than just friends.
We're your family.

405
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:51,105
So what do you say?

406
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:55,147
Ready to put those things on again,
go another round?

407
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:00,118
Let's do it.

408
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:02,739
All right.

409
00:22:11,454 --> 00:22:13,833
You're all set.
You won't even know it's there.

410
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,593
Because whoever said
aesthetics aren't important?

411
00:22:16,751 --> 00:22:18,003
Not me.

412
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,259
Let's go.

413
00:22:22,715 --> 00:22:23,887
Hey, Cait.

414
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:27,601
I know how hard this is gonna be for you,
but we have to stop him.

415
00:22:27,762 --> 00:22:29,390
I know, and I wanna be supportive.
I Just...

416
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:31,651
I can't face Jay.

417
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:33,060
Whatever his real name is.

418
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:35,104
What does that mean?

419
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:38,027
Well, you remember when I was
looking for his doppelganger, right?

420
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,157
Yeah, I mean, you couldn't find him.

421
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,318
Because there is no Jay Garrick
on this earth.

422
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:45,079
His doppelganger's name is Hunter Zolomon.

423
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,124
Hunter Zolomon?

424
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,414
Are... Are you sure?

425
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:51,954
Yeah, why?

426
00:22:54,455 --> 00:22:57,460
Well, because on my earth,

427
00:22:57,625 --> 00:23:00,470
Hunter Zolomon
was a convicted serial killer.

428
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,137
That's Jay?

429
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,270
No, that is Hunter.

430
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,855
Last public photo of Hunter Zolomon.

431
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:12,982
Instantly recognizable to people
from my earth.

432
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:16,395
On my earth, serial killers are
an anomaly, so a lot of media attention

433
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,564
to this... There was a podcast.

434
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:23,994
When Hunter was 11, his father
killed his mother right in front of him.

435
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:26,747
Father sent to prison,
Hunter grew up in the foster care system.

436
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:30,751
Years later, he was convicted
on 23 counts of murder?

437
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,207
23?

438
00:23:32,368 --> 00:23:35,838
That's, like, some real
Hannibal Lecter-type level.

439
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,750
After the trial,

440
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:41,837
Hunter was sent to the St. Perez
Mental Asylum for the Criminally Insane.

441
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:48,603
Given daily electroshock therapy
to cure him of his urges,

442
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,262
and then faded from view.

443
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:52,977
Until the night your
particle accelerator exploded.

444
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,186
That's right.

445
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:56,352
The dark matter crept into
the mental asylum.

446
00:23:56,518 --> 00:24:00,864
I'd thought piping the explosion
underground would limit exposure.

447
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:04,242
I was wrong, all it did was create
an unstoppable monster.

448
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,507
He's not unstoppable.

449
00:25:06,212 --> 00:25:08,010
Jay doesn't know
that we know who he really is.

450
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,267
He thinks that his past is a secret.

451
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:12,094
So?

452
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:16,265
I think I have an idea
of how we can stop him.

453
00:25:23,896 --> 00:25:25,022
Are you sure Jay can't get in here?

454
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,442
Pretty sure. Butjust in case...

455
00:25:27,608 --> 00:25:28,861
How do you use this?

456
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:31,622
All right, so you aim it
and then you pull the trigger.

457
00:25:31,779 --> 00:25:32,780
Smart-ass.

458
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,074
Barry and Cisco are in position.

459
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,413
Let's hope this thing works.

460
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:36,955
You ready, buddy?

461
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:38,244
Yeah.

462
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:41,126
You've always believed in me.

463
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:42,666
Thank you.

464
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,544
You got this.

465
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:10,569
Reverb's doppelganger
has increased his powers.

466
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:13,785
Hatred is a strong motivator.

467
00:26:13,946 --> 00:26:18,669
You were unwise to reopen the breach.

468
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:22,001
I'm not gonna let you terrorize
another world anymore.

469
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:28,718
Without your speed,
you won't be able to stop me.

470
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:30,801
Let's see.

471
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:41,023
- Zoom's gaining on Barry.
- He can't catch him.

472
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:42,355
Better not.

473
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:56,705
That was close.

474
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:57,865
Too close.

475
00:26:58,032 --> 00:26:59,285
The tachyon device is working.

476
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,249
Yeah. Here they come.

477
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,218
They're here.

478
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:17,970
Ah.

479
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:21,647
You've gotten faster. Good.

480
00:27:22,473 --> 00:27:25,227
There'll be more for rne to take.

481
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:26,819
You want my speed?

482
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:34,862
Catch me.

483
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:01,601
You're gonna wanna see this, son.

484
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:15,949
- Get him, Barry.
- Lt's working.

485
00:28:25,953 --> 00:28:26,954
No!

486
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:45,473
How did you figure out who I was?

487
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:49,811
You made a mistake.

488
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:55,284
You told Caitlin
who your doppelganger was.

489
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:02,202
I had to do something to get her
to stop trying to fix me.

490
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:04,826
She's a smart girl.

491
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:07,747
And that I was Zoom?

492
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,669
The Velocity-Nine.

493
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:14,007
When you run fast enough,
it turns a speedster's lightning blue.

494
00:29:15,836 --> 00:29:17,338
We would have helped you.

495
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:21,306
We would have done anything we could
to save your life.

496
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:23,015
Not everything.

497
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:26,598
Caitlin found you a cure!

498
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,517
A temporary one!

499
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:30,230
I'm dying, Barry!

500
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:33,192
There's only one thing
that can give me what I need.

501
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:36,984
And you just don't care how many lives
you destroy tryin' to get it?

502
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,697
How many people you kill?

503
00:29:38,859 --> 00:29:40,031
No, I don't!

504
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:44,371
That feeling was taken from me
a long time ago.

505
00:29:49,453 --> 00:29:51,000
We're not so different, you know.

506
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:54,631
What happened to us when we were kids?

507
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:57,636
You could have just as easily become me.

508
00:29:58,005 --> 00:29:59,051
No.

509
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,929
I'd never become like you.

510
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:03,885
I got to say...

511
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:10,650
that was smart
using my parents against me.

512
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:13,773
Family.

513
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:15,940
Such a weakness.

514
00:30:16,647 --> 00:30:17,990
Not for all of us.

515
00:30:18,482 --> 00:30:20,576
Well, that's where you're wrong.

516
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,743
It's time I get what I came for.

517
00:30:26,615 --> 00:30:29,210
You're not getting anything from me.

518
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:33,415
You're not getting anything
from anybody ever again.

519
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:34,753
On any earth.

520
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,179
You can't lock up the darkness.

521
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:42,340
What did you just say?

522
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:47,683
You can't lock up the darkness.

523
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:04,491
No!

524
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:12,170
He was right there.

525
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:13,329
I know.

526
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:14,919
I mean, we had him.

527
00:31:15,082 --> 00:31:17,175
We had him, I can't believe it.

528
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,511
Wally!

529
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:29,804
Up here!

530
00:31:59,875 --> 00:32:01,719
Hey, hey, hey.

531
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:05,015
Where are we? Where are we?

532
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:10,311
Well, help! Somebody please help!

533
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:21,365
There's only one person
who can help you now.

534
00:32:24,608 --> 00:32:26,531
The Flash.

535
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:31,156
The Flash?

536
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:34,202
Why would he help me?
He doesn't even know who I am.

537
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:38,044
Someone he cares about

538
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:43,383
cares about you.

539
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,601
Dad.

540
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:53,763
Dad, coffee?

541
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,604
We're gonna get him back.

542
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,816
What if we could stop Zoom
through a vibe somehow?

543
00:33:04,982 --> 00:33:06,359
We can weaponize the goggles...

544
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:07,617
Not enough time to weaponize, Ramon.

545
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:10,951
Okay, what if we modify the pulse rifle
to emit a low-level EMF?

546
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,082
We don't have the equipment
to modify the pulse levels now.

547
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,038
Then we do another
snatch-and-grab mission.

548
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:16,749
By the time we
scale those cliffs, Zoom could already...

549
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:18,038
I need a minute.

550
00:33:50,569 --> 00:33:54,290
Barry, I know you can't
give up your speed to that monster,

551
00:33:56,451 --> 00:34:01,126
but I also know that I wanna get
my son back, and I don't know what to do.

552
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,707
I do.

553
00:34:06,001 --> 00:34:07,970
Wally, I mean, he's...

554
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,010
He's part of the family.

555
00:34:10,172 --> 00:34:13,222
He's a part of our family.

556
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:19,565
And we do whatever we have to
to keep the ones we care about safe.

557
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:23,315
No, you... You can't give up your speed.

558
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:25,813
That's not your decision.

559
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:32,490
This is the only way, Joe.

560
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:42,335
Barry, are you sure?

561
00:34:42,496 --> 00:34:43,918
I'm sure.

562
00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:46,005
I mean, we don't even know
if he'll be able to hear me.

563
00:34:46,166 --> 00:34:47,668
He'll hear you.

564
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:07,356
Isee him.

565
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:12,530
Wally's alive.

566
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:15,909
Thank God.

567
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,791
Do you see Jay?

568
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:26,875
Isee him.

569
00:35:29,918 --> 00:35:31,592
He can sense me.

570
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,007
Jay.

571
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,054
Vibe.

572
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:42,393
He'll do it.

573
00:35:44,224 --> 00:35:46,648
Barry will give you his speed.

574
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:01,583
Hey.

575
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,416
Dad!

576
00:36:09,583 --> 00:36:11,585
Wally, hold on. Let him go.

577
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:18,101
We had a deal.

578
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:22,768
My speed for Wally's life.

579
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:27,273
Hand him over and it's yours.

580
00:36:29,269 --> 00:36:30,442
- You okay?
- Yeah.

581
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,949
- You need to get out of here now.
- I can't.

582
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:34,530
- Go fast.
- Cisco.

583
00:36:35,275 --> 00:36:36,277
Let's go.

584
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:41,536
Let's get this over with.

585
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:04,978
This thing is how I stole
the Flash's speed the first time.

586
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:08,815
Now all he needs to do is run
and his Speed Force

587
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:11,981
will transfer into this vial.

588
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:14,490
But only as long as I calibrate it.

589
00:37:14,648 --> 00:37:16,400
Get to work.

590
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:19,157
Wells.

591
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:34,677
One day, I'm gonna knock
that smug expression clean off your face.

592
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:44,766
So this was your plan all along, huh?

593
00:37:45,262 --> 00:37:49,860
Ever since the skies parted and showed me
another world with another speedster.

594
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:53,693
Once I saw you, I came here,
figured out what I had to do.

595
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:57,697
How are you still alive?

596
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:59,030
We saw you die.

597
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:00,536
You did.

598
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:03,447
So what was that? Speed mirage?

599
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:06,706
Speed mirage?

600
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:07,869
Uh, no.

601
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:10,003
Even I'm not that fast.

602
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:15,005
I knew that I couldn't be
on two earths at the same time.

603
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:20,516
So I went back in time
and I met another version of myself.

604
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:23,222
You're a time remnant.
Like the Reverse-Flash.

605
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:26,228
I also knew that the only way
to make Barry become faster

606
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:31,233
was if you all witnessed
your old pal, Jay, die.

607
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:33,898
When did you decide to do that?

608
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:37,072
Oh, once you closed all the breaches,
went to Earth-2.

609
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:41,614
Believe me, getting my time remnant
to agree to me murdering him...

610
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:43,324
Took a bit of convincing,

611
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,411
but once he saw the...

612
00:38:45,572 --> 00:38:48,998
Well, the genius in my plan,
he was all for it.

613
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:54,088
Who's the man in the iron mask?

614
00:38:56,166 --> 00:38:58,090
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

615
00:38:59,753 --> 00:39:01,005
Why the charade?

616
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,679
Running around dressed like the Flash?

617
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:05,264
To give people a hope, Detective.

618
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,851
H0pe?

619
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:08,762
So I can rip it away from them.

620
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:14,103
It's so fun pretending to be a hero.

621
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:18,318
You are no hero.

622
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:22,280
You're nothing but a monster.

623
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:24,367
You're nothing but a monster.

624
00:39:25,028 --> 00:39:26,827
You're a monster.

625
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:28,206
No!

626
00:39:36,164 --> 00:39:37,166
Barry?

627
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:39,010
It's all right, Joe.

628
00:40:20,208 --> 00:40:21,460
He's slowing down.

629
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:24,802
The Speed Force is leaving his body.

630
00:40:24,963 --> 00:40:26,965
He's becoming human again.

631
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:42,652
Barry, are you okay?

632
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:45,693
I'm okay.

633
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:10,510
Thank you, Flash!

634
00:41:10,677 --> 00:41:12,054
Jay, stop!

635
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:13,637
Please.

636
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:20,565
If anything you ever said to me was true,

637
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:25,199
or anything we ever shared was real,
then please just let him go.

638
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:29,282
Please. I know some piece of you
did care for me,

639
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:34,291
so if you have any humanity left,
then please, let him go.

640
00:41:48,922 --> 00:41:50,300
Caitlin!
