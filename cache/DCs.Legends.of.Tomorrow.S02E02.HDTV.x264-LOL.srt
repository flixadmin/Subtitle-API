1
00:00:01,201 --> 00:00:02,472
My name is Sara Lance.

2
00:00:02,601 --> 00:00:05,570
Last year, a former Time Master
named Rip Hunter recruited

3
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:08,436
a team of heroes and villains
to save the world, and we did,

4
00:00:08,586 --> 00:00:11,521
but in the process we
destroyed the Time Masters.

5
00:00:11,523 --> 00:00:13,289
Now we've taken up their mantle

6
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:15,859
of protecting the timeline
from time criminals.

7
00:00:15,861 --> 00:00:18,194
We are no longer saving the world.

8
00:00:18,196 --> 00:00:19,429
We are saving history.

9
00:00:20,565 --> 00:00:22,932
But don't call us heroes.

10
00:00:22,934 --> 00:00:25,702
We are legends.

11
00:00:25,704 --> 00:00:27,770
Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...

12
00:00:27,772 --> 00:00:29,205
Heywood. Dr. Nate Heywood.

13
00:00:29,207 --> 00:00:31,441
I need to talk to you about
Sara Lance, Ray Palmer,

14
00:00:31,443 --> 00:00:33,510
and the rest of the Legends.

15
00:00:33,512 --> 00:00:34,744
I think they're all in trouble.

16
00:00:34,746 --> 00:00:36,379
I am piloting us on a collision course

17
00:00:36,381 --> 00:00:37,413
with a torpedo.

18
00:00:40,418 --> 00:00:42,852
- Gideon.
- I'm here, Captain.

19
00:00:44,289 --> 00:00:45,955
Where's Captain Hunter?

20
00:00:45,957 --> 00:00:48,222
I would be happy to play
his final message for you all.

21
00:00:48,223 --> 00:00:49,726
Together, you are the best crew,

22
00:00:49,728 --> 00:00:52,929
the best team a captain
could ever hope for.

23
00:00:52,931 --> 00:00:53,963
Good luck.

24
00:00:53,965 --> 00:00:56,499
What do you guys say we get out of 1942?

25
00:00:56,501 --> 00:00:58,501
Not until you answer a few questions.

26
00:01:02,107 --> 00:01:04,173
We're the Justice Society of America.

27
00:01:04,175 --> 00:01:05,875
And you're coming with us.

28
00:01:05,877 --> 00:01:06,876
Oh, my God.

29
00:01:06,878 --> 00:01:08,478
You're Commander Steel.

30
00:01:11,515 --> 00:01:13,082
Who the hell are you?

31
00:01:13,084 --> 00:01:14,517
- Whoa, whoa.
- Just relax.

32
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:15,852
We're all friends here.

33
00:01:15,854 --> 00:01:17,520
Rex Tyler told us about the JSA.

34
00:01:17,522 --> 00:01:18,721
You guys are awesome.

35
00:01:18,723 --> 00:01:20,823
Hey. The name's Jax.

36
00:01:20,825 --> 00:01:22,825
Rex never mentioned any of you.

37
00:01:22,827 --> 00:01:24,127
Mind telling us what you were doing

38
00:01:24,129 --> 00:01:25,261
impersonating OSS agents?

39
00:01:25,263 --> 00:01:26,763
It's quite simple, actually.

40
00:01:26,765 --> 00:01:29,699
We were protecting Albert
Einstein from Nazi agents

41
00:01:29,701 --> 00:01:31,434
who were attempting to kidnap him

42
00:01:31,436 --> 00:01:33,836
and force him to build an atomic bomb

43
00:01:33,838 --> 00:01:35,371
in the future.

44
00:01:35,373 --> 00:01:37,473
Time travel. It's... it's hard to explain.

45
00:01:37,475 --> 00:01:39,309
You can take all the time you need.

46
00:01:39,311 --> 00:01:40,777
In custody.

47
00:01:40,779 --> 00:01:43,680
Whoa, take it easy.
Let's talk for a minute.

48
00:01:43,682 --> 00:01:44,814
I mean, after all, you're my...

49
00:01:52,457 --> 00:01:54,624
Obsidian, shut off the lights!

50
00:01:56,795 --> 00:01:58,895
Wow, that's pretty neat.

51
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:18,047
She's trying to kill us!

52
00:02:18,049 --> 00:02:19,415
Nah, she's just flirting.

53
00:02:33,298 --> 00:02:35,898
We don't want to fight!

54
00:02:50,215 --> 00:02:51,180
You win!

55
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:23,155

56
00:03:25,783 --> 00:03:28,651
You just had to mention
time travel, didn't you?

57
00:03:28,653 --> 00:03:31,087
Yeah, well, at least he
didn't throw the first punch.

58
00:03:31,089 --> 00:03:33,796
I'm perfectly capable of
defending myself, Raymond.

59
00:03:33,855 --> 00:03:35,254
I'm pretty sure that you got knocked out

60
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:37,389
by a teenager in a star-spangled leotard.

61
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:38,724
Her name's Stargirl.

62
00:03:38,726 --> 00:03:40,626
Did anybody catch her
regular-person name?

63
00:03:40,628 --> 00:03:42,561
I'm surprised you
didn't ask for her number.

64
00:03:42,563 --> 00:03:45,130
Oh, so it's my fault that
we got our asses handed to us?

65
00:03:45,132 --> 00:03:47,066
Look, they're just better
coordinated than us.

66
00:03:47,068 --> 00:03:48,234
You guys, just listen to me for two...

67
00:03:48,236 --> 00:03:49,244
Pretty, shut up.

68
00:03:49,245 --> 00:03:51,136
If I recall, you were late
coming to the party.

69
00:03:51,138 --> 00:03:52,805
Oh, is that right? How did you see that?

70
00:03:52,807 --> 00:03:54,907
Never laid eyes on
them before in my life.

71
00:03:54,909 --> 00:03:57,810
They seemed quite
adamant that they knew you.

72
00:03:57,812 --> 00:04:00,212
Believe me, if I'd met this bunch,

73
00:04:00,214 --> 00:04:01,747
pretty sure I'd remember.

74
00:04:01,749 --> 00:04:02,882
What do you propose we do with 'em?

75
00:04:02,884 --> 00:04:04,850
If I may be so bold, sir,

76
00:04:04,852 --> 00:04:06,485
I say we find the darkest hole

77
00:04:06,487 --> 00:04:08,487
in Leavenworth and throw away the key.

78
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:12,258
I say we ship 'em to the boys in
Bellevue Mental Hospital.

79
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,827
I suppose before we do anything,

80
00:04:14,829 --> 00:04:15,928
we ought to question them.

81
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,596
So far up Mr. Goggle's...

82
00:04:19,432 --> 00:04:21,600
If we can even manage to get a word in.

83
00:04:21,602 --> 00:04:22,735
I don't understand why they were

84
00:04:22,737 --> 00:04:24,303
tracking us in the first place.

85
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,205
Because they're the
Justice Society of America,

86
00:04:26,207 --> 00:04:29,074
the single greatest secret force
this country has ever known.

87
00:04:29,076 --> 00:04:31,710
If it's so secret,
how do you know about them?

88
00:04:31,712 --> 00:04:34,947
Because his Nazi handlers
have briefed him, no doubt.

89
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:37,650
- Look, I'm not a Nazi.
- I'm a historian.

90
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:40,119
Here we go with the time
travel nonsense again.

91
00:04:40,121 --> 00:04:42,054
070233.

92
00:04:43,124 --> 00:04:44,456
What?

93
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,892
Those are numbers on your dog tags.

94
00:04:46,894 --> 00:04:48,494
They're not disclosed on any documents,

95
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,763
military or otherwise.

96
00:04:50,765 --> 00:04:52,398
How do you know that?

97
00:04:58,706 --> 00:05:00,773
You gave these to your wife

98
00:05:00,775 --> 00:05:03,909
after the birth of your son in 1955.

99
00:05:03,911 --> 00:05:06,178
The dent in the front was
from an assassin's bullet

100
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,315
when you saved President
Roosevelt in 1939.

101
00:05:09,317 --> 00:05:12,751
Your son passed them down to his son,

102
00:05:12,753 --> 00:05:14,520
me.

103
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,699
You are late, Herr Thawne.

104
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,233
You'll find that I have

105
00:05:28,235 --> 00:05:32,237
an entirely different
concept of time than most.

106
00:05:32,239 --> 00:05:33,572
Did you located the item?

107
00:05:33,574 --> 00:05:35,607
It's in Berlin.

108
00:05:35,609 --> 00:05:37,710
The Fuehrer refuses to part with it.

109
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:41,046
I have something much
more valuable to offer him.

110
00:05:41,048 --> 00:05:44,917
The JSA are basically a
group of super-soldiers.

111
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:49,054
To win, the Reich will need their own.

112
00:05:49,056 --> 00:05:50,723
This is just a taste.

113
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,392
Enough to dose one person.

114
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:56,028
Proof of concept.

115
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,830
Give me what I want

116
00:05:57,832 --> 00:06:00,699
and your Fuehrer
will be planting his flag

117
00:06:00,701 --> 00:06:04,103
on the White House lawn
within a matter of months.

118
00:06:08,109 --> 00:06:10,809
Do we have an accord?

119
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:17,449
Mr. Tyler.

120
00:06:17,451 --> 00:06:19,118
See? Rex Tyler.

121
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,352
Told you we knew the guy.

122
00:06:20,354 --> 00:06:21,687
I don't know you.

123
00:06:21,689 --> 00:06:22,855
Any of you.

124
00:06:22,857 --> 00:06:24,199
Tell me what the heck is going on here.

125
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,706
- Well, we tried explaining...
- I'm sorry, ma'am,

126
00:06:26,709 --> 00:06:28,676
I was addressing the team leader.

127
00:06:28,678 --> 00:06:29,677
Uh... uh... oh.

128
00:06:29,679 --> 00:06:31,212
Oh, well, simply put,

129
00:06:31,214 --> 00:06:33,381
we've come here as time travelers

130
00:06:33,383 --> 00:06:36,584
to identify aberrations in
history and correct them.

131
00:06:36,586 --> 00:06:38,085
We're superheroes, like you guys.

132
00:06:38,087 --> 00:06:40,621
You think you're just like us?

133
00:06:40,623 --> 00:06:42,289
What are your qualifications?

134
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:43,924
Well, I used my personal fortune

135
00:06:43,926 --> 00:06:45,693
to create an advanced exo-skeleton,

136
00:06:45,695 --> 00:06:47,395
which is powered by dwarf star alloy.

137
00:06:47,397 --> 00:06:50,297
And I'm nothing like you. I'm a criminal.

138
00:06:50,299 --> 00:06:52,900
Are there any other felons on your team?

139
00:06:52,902 --> 00:06:54,368
- No, no...
- Yes.

140
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:58,038
She's an assassin,
but never convicted, right?

141
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,608
We're protecting history.
It's pretty important.

142
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,943
In the future, you risk your own life

143
00:07:02,945 --> 00:07:05,946
to save us, Mr. Tyler.

144
00:07:05,948 --> 00:07:07,448
How do you know my name?

145
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,450
Because you told us your name

146
00:07:09,452 --> 00:07:11,485
in 2016.

147
00:07:11,487 --> 00:07:13,587
My name is Rex Tyler,

148
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:16,524
and I'm a member of the
Justice Society of America.

149
00:07:16,526 --> 00:07:18,359
Never heard of 'em, pal.

150
00:07:18,361 --> 00:07:20,394
That's because I'm from 1942.

151
00:07:20,396 --> 00:07:22,463
The same year in which all of you will...

152
00:07:22,465 --> 00:07:24,064
Bite the bullet?

153
00:07:24,066 --> 00:07:27,268
So if we don't go back to 1942,
we're safe, right?

154
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,536
Not to be rude,

155
00:07:28,538 --> 00:07:30,871
but how do we know you
are who you say you are?

156
00:07:30,873 --> 00:07:33,207
You all have no idea
what you're up against.

157
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:38,078
If you return to 1942,
the consequences will be

158
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,547
catastrophic.

159
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,586
That was weird.

160
00:07:49,292 --> 00:07:51,425
So I crashed your ship,

161
00:07:51,427 --> 00:07:54,061
told you some bunk about
not staying in 1942,

162
00:07:54,063 --> 00:07:56,597
and then I just disappeared?

163
00:07:56,599 --> 00:07:59,733
It was more like "fritzing" out.

164
00:07:59,735 --> 00:08:00,801
You might've been on to something

165
00:08:00,803 --> 00:08:02,169
with the Bellevue idea.

166
00:08:06,675 --> 00:08:07,975
Yes, Mr. President, sir?

167
00:08:07,977 --> 00:08:09,143
FDR?

168
00:08:09,145 --> 00:08:12,980
Oh, tell him I'm a big
fan of the New Deal.

169
00:08:12,982 --> 00:08:15,149
Hey, uh, I'm sorry about earlier.

170
00:08:15,151 --> 00:08:16,584
I just, uh,

171
00:08:16,586 --> 00:08:19,220
I never imagined meeting you like this.

172
00:08:19,222 --> 00:08:21,222
I actually never imagined
meeting you at all

173
00:08:21,224 --> 00:08:24,959
because you're dead.

174
00:08:24,961 --> 00:08:28,362
I mean, where I come from,
you're... you're dead.

175
00:08:28,364 --> 00:08:32,600
My dad used to tell me
bedtime stories about you.

176
00:08:33,769 --> 00:08:35,769
All the battles you fought.

177
00:08:35,771 --> 00:08:37,505
You're a hero to me.

178
00:08:37,507 --> 00:08:39,840
I'm a hero to a lot of people.

179
00:08:39,842 --> 00:08:42,142
That's the job.

180
00:08:42,144 --> 00:08:44,378
Of course. All right.

181
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,947
You can count on us, sir.

182
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:48,349
All right, we have to move out.

183
00:08:48,351 --> 00:08:50,184
Baron Krieger's been spotted in Paris.

184
00:08:50,186 --> 00:08:51,652
If it's permissible, sir,

185
00:08:51,654 --> 00:08:53,787
I'll fly ahead and record
Krieger's movements.

186
00:08:53,789 --> 00:08:55,890
Sensible, as always.

187
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,959
We could help you out with that.

188
00:08:58,961 --> 00:09:00,861
Fighting Nazis is kind of our thing.

189
00:09:00,863 --> 00:09:02,563
Yeah. Last time we tried,

190
00:09:02,565 --> 00:09:04,899
we ended up at the bottom
of the Atlantic Ocean.

191
00:09:04,901 --> 00:09:07,401
We can handle Adolf's buddies.

192
00:09:07,403 --> 00:09:09,803
I think it's best for
the 20th Century if...

193
00:09:09,805 --> 00:09:12,172
For us to leave it?

194
00:09:12,174 --> 00:09:15,075
And that's why you're team leader.

195
00:09:15,077 --> 00:09:18,145
Well, I guess we'll be on our way, then.

196
00:09:20,483 --> 00:09:22,917
Can you believe what we
just saw with our own eyes?

197
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,218
The actual JSA.

198
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,687
And Hourman? That guy's amazing.

199
00:09:26,689 --> 00:09:29,323
Aw, haircut's in love.

200
00:09:29,325 --> 00:09:31,559
Come on.

201
00:09:31,561 --> 00:09:33,694
Those guys were precise, professional,

202
00:09:33,696 --> 00:09:34,995
in constant agreement.

203
00:09:34,997 --> 00:09:36,096
We can't even agree on

204
00:09:36,098 --> 00:09:37,531
whose turn it is to make dinner.

205
00:09:37,533 --> 00:09:38,465
Not it.

206
00:09:38,467 --> 00:09:40,100
I can't argue with you, man.

207
00:09:40,102 --> 00:09:41,468
They got some serious skills.

208
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,736
Big deal.

209
00:09:42,738 --> 00:09:45,806
Apart from the fancy
headquarters, discipline,

210
00:09:45,808 --> 00:09:47,675
and calls from the White House,

211
00:09:47,677 --> 00:09:49,843
I mean, what do they have that we don't?

212
00:09:49,845 --> 00:09:51,745
An actual leader.

213
00:09:51,747 --> 00:09:53,013
Rip's gone,

214
00:09:53,015 --> 00:09:54,615
and who knows when or if

215
00:09:54,617 --> 00:09:56,116
we'll ever find him.

216
00:09:56,118 --> 00:09:57,484
In the meantime,

217
00:09:57,486 --> 00:09:59,520
we need someone who can
make the tough calls.

218
00:09:59,522 --> 00:10:01,855
Let me guess, you're volunteering?

219
00:10:01,857 --> 00:10:03,290
With all due respect, Raymond,

220
00:10:03,292 --> 00:10:05,426
I think there's a reason
Mr. Tyler just naturally

221
00:10:05,428 --> 00:10:08,362
assumed I was in charge.

222
00:10:08,364 --> 00:10:11,932
Yeah, because Mr. Tyler is from 1942

223
00:10:11,934 --> 00:10:14,635
and you're some old white dude.

224
00:10:14,637 --> 00:10:16,437
"Old," meaning

225
00:10:16,439 --> 00:10:17,705
experienced.

226
00:10:17,707 --> 00:10:19,673
- What about...
- Martin's right.

227
00:10:19,675 --> 00:10:22,543
With Rip gone, we could use
some adult supervision.

228
00:10:22,545 --> 00:10:24,311
Congratulations,

229
00:10:24,313 --> 00:10:26,580
Captain.

230
00:10:26,582 --> 00:10:28,048
Well, then.

231
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:29,683
Thank you all for your support.

232
00:10:29,685 --> 00:10:31,752
Now, I believe our first order of business

233
00:10:31,754 --> 00:10:34,922
concerns Dr. Heywood.

234
00:10:41,497 --> 00:10:43,163
Is that Grandpa?

235
00:10:43,165 --> 00:10:44,698
Yeah.

236
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,233
Pictures of him are hard to find.

237
00:10:46,235 --> 00:10:47,601
You just got to know where to look.

238
00:10:47,603 --> 00:10:49,169
Well, that must've been something,

239
00:10:49,171 --> 00:10:52,006
getting the chance to meet him.

240
00:10:52,008 --> 00:10:53,374
You would think so, right?

241
00:10:53,376 --> 00:10:56,810
But... I don't know.

242
00:10:56,812 --> 00:10:59,647
Felt empty somehow.

243
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:02,583
Well, meeting your idols usually does.

244
00:11:02,585 --> 00:11:04,051
Think of it this way.

245
00:11:04,053 --> 00:11:06,086
You are gonna have one hell of a story

246
00:11:06,088 --> 00:11:08,355
to tell your friends when
you get back home.

247
00:11:08,357 --> 00:11:11,258
Back home? 2016 back home?

248
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,660
You can't cut me from the team.

249
00:11:12,662 --> 00:11:13,861
Well, you're right,

250
00:11:13,863 --> 00:11:16,430
because you're not a member of it.

251
00:11:16,432 --> 00:11:20,134
And even if you were,
history can be dangerous,

252
00:11:20,136 --> 00:11:21,535
and it's no place for a...

253
00:11:21,537 --> 00:11:22,670
A historian?

254
00:11:22,672 --> 00:11:25,773
I'm more than...

255
00:11:25,775 --> 00:11:26,874
that's weird.

256
00:11:26,876 --> 00:11:28,175
It's really not so weird.

257
00:11:28,177 --> 00:11:29,309
You don't have any superpowers.

258
00:11:29,311 --> 00:11:30,577
You don't even have training...

259
00:11:30,579 --> 00:11:33,347
Not that. My grandfather's dog tags.

260
00:11:33,349 --> 00:11:34,815
They aren't around my neck.

261
00:11:34,817 --> 00:11:36,316
So?

262
00:11:36,318 --> 00:11:37,751
So I haven't taken
'em off since I was a kid.

263
00:11:37,753 --> 00:11:39,953
They were here a minute ago,
and now they've...

264
00:11:39,955 --> 00:11:41,655
Vanished.

265
00:11:41,657 --> 00:11:43,157
What does that mean?

266
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:44,992
That history has changed.

267
00:11:48,597 --> 00:11:50,130
What are you doing?

268
00:11:50,132 --> 00:11:53,267
Reviewing my notes on the JSA.

269
00:11:55,003 --> 00:11:57,938
We have to go back to 1942.

270
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,174
Nate, the JSA was pretty explicit

271
00:12:00,176 --> 00:12:02,509
on us not going back to 1942.

272
00:12:02,511 --> 00:12:04,011
That mission the JSA went on

273
00:12:04,013 --> 00:12:07,681
to track down Baron Krieger in Paris,

274
00:12:07,683 --> 00:12:09,516
they're all gonna die there tomorrow.

275
00:12:11,754 --> 00:12:13,554
My grandfather too.

276
00:12:17,915 --> 00:12:20,599
_

277
00:12:20,609 --> 00:12:23,077
And this is where the JSA's gonna die?

278
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:24,178
Not unless we save them,

279
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,114
including my grandfather.

280
00:12:26,116 --> 00:12:27,849
Well, first we got to find them.

281
00:12:27,851 --> 00:12:29,751
Fortunately, we know they're looking for

282
00:12:29,753 --> 00:12:32,387
a Nazi named Krieger.

283
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:33,821
A Nazi named Krieger...

284
00:12:33,823 --> 00:12:35,423
can someone please help
me operate this thing?

285
00:12:35,425 --> 00:12:36,524
Oh, God.

286
00:12:36,526 --> 00:12:37,725
Thank you.

287
00:12:37,727 --> 00:12:40,495
Krieger and his men
frequent Folies-Bergère.

288
00:12:40,497 --> 00:12:43,264
We find Krieger, we find the JSA.

289
00:12:43,266 --> 00:12:46,200
So how do we sneak into a Nazi nightclub?

290
00:12:46,202 --> 00:12:48,303
I have a plan.

291
00:12:48,305 --> 00:12:50,605
Are any of you familiar
with Max Suelzenfuss,

292
00:12:50,607 --> 00:12:52,607
better known by his stage name,

293
00:12:52,609 --> 00:12:54,008
Max Lorenz?

294
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:56,811
He was Hitler's favorite
singer and, fortunately,

295
00:12:56,813 --> 00:13:00,982
bears a passing resemblance to moi.

296
00:13:00,984 --> 00:13:02,417
That's French.

297
00:13:02,419 --> 00:13:03,818
Hm.

298
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,620
Grey.

299
00:13:05,622 --> 00:13:07,088
Are you sure about this?

300
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,823
'Cause bluffing at a
card game isn't exactly

301
00:13:08,825 --> 00:13:10,358
the same as bluffing Nazis.

302
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,160
You disapprove of my plan?

303
00:13:12,162 --> 00:13:13,628
I'm just saying, we're
dropping into the middle

304
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:16,030
of World War II here,
and you're not exactly

305
00:13:16,032 --> 00:13:18,132
a wartime consigliere.

306
00:13:18,134 --> 00:13:20,601
- And let me guess, you are?
- I...

307
00:13:20,603 --> 00:13:23,938
Or perhaps you would prefer
the arsonist, the assassin,

308
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,873
or the incredible shrinking man?

309
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,275
I'm just saying,

310
00:13:27,277 --> 00:13:29,978
you're smart and analytical and stuff,

311
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,379
and real deliberate,

312
00:13:31,381 --> 00:13:33,047
but when bullets start flying,

313
00:13:33,049 --> 00:13:34,649
analytical's not gonna cut it.

314
00:13:34,651 --> 00:13:36,851
Well, thank you for pointing
out my inadequacies.

315
00:13:36,853 --> 00:13:37,919
Come on, Grey.

316
00:13:37,921 --> 00:13:41,255
It's Captain Grey now.

317
00:13:41,257 --> 00:13:43,291
Well, I'm glad it hasn't
gone to your head.

318
00:13:46,329 --> 00:13:49,130
Ouch. Where'd you get that?

319
00:13:49,132 --> 00:13:50,798
Uh, it must have happened

320
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,901
when I fell after my
grandfather decked me.

321
00:13:53,903 --> 00:13:56,170
Hey, that fabrication room's pretty cool.

322
00:13:56,172 --> 00:13:58,406
Can it really make clothes from any era?

323
00:13:58,408 --> 00:14:00,141
Yeah, you know, we may not have trophies

324
00:14:00,143 --> 00:14:01,876
or framed letters from former presidents,

325
00:14:01,878 --> 00:14:04,479
but we've got a few cool toys.

326
00:14:04,481 --> 00:14:07,548
Including ingestible translator.

327
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,649
Swallow this,

328
00:14:08,651 --> 00:14:10,218
you'll be able to speak and understand

329
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,053
any language spoken to you.

330
00:14:12,055 --> 00:14:13,521
That's cool, but I already speak

331
00:14:13,523 --> 00:14:16,758
German, French, Japanese,
Italian, and Latin.

332
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,959
What?

333
00:14:17,961 --> 00:14:19,761
You speak six different languages;

334
00:14:19,763 --> 00:14:21,496
you have a tendency to
run towards danger;

335
00:14:21,498 --> 00:14:24,232
and you're related to
a member of the JSA.

336
00:14:24,234 --> 00:14:26,067
Why did you become a historian?

337
00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:27,668
It's a long story.

338
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,836
Um, hey, where do I go

339
00:14:28,838 --> 00:14:31,472
to get a gun?

340
00:14:31,474 --> 00:14:33,041
You ever shoot someone before?

341
00:14:33,043 --> 00:14:34,675
I mean, I may not be trained by

342
00:14:34,677 --> 00:14:35,977
the League of Assassins,

343
00:14:35,979 --> 00:14:37,745
but I can take care of myself.

344
00:14:37,747 --> 00:14:39,380
Not out here you can't.

345
00:14:39,382 --> 00:14:41,282
Out here, even the strongest

346
00:14:41,284 --> 00:14:43,051
and the bravest of us die.

347
00:14:43,053 --> 00:14:46,654
Like Captain Hunter?

348
00:14:46,656 --> 00:14:49,357
I'm just trying to make sure
you get home safe and sound.

349
00:14:52,162 --> 00:14:53,795
So the lady does have a heart.

350
00:14:53,797 --> 00:14:55,396
Don't tell anyone.

351
00:15:02,872 --> 00:15:04,338
Excuse me...

352
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,842
The club is closed tonight
for a private function.

353
00:15:07,844 --> 00:15:10,912
Do you have any idea who I am?

354
00:15:10,914 --> 00:15:13,915
I am Max Lorenz.

355
00:15:13,917 --> 00:15:15,516
- Did you say Max Lorenz?
- Yes.

356
00:15:15,518 --> 00:15:18,920
And I have never been
treated with such rudeness.

357
00:15:18,922 --> 00:15:20,154
Of course not.

358
00:15:20,156 --> 00:15:22,590
You're more than welcome here, Herr Max.

359
00:15:22,592 --> 00:15:24,392
Thank you.

360
00:15:44,446 --> 00:15:46,147
No sign of Krieger or the JSA.

361
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:48,483
Canvass the area and stay on the comms.

362
00:15:51,233 --> 00:15:52,500
Think I got something.

363
00:15:52,502 --> 00:15:54,402
The lady with the animal powers.

364
00:15:54,404 --> 00:15:57,105
But she looks different.

365
00:15:57,107 --> 00:15:58,807
You mean hot.

366
00:16:02,111 --> 00:16:04,479
May I?

367
00:16:07,116 --> 00:16:08,516
What are you doing?

368
00:16:08,518 --> 00:16:10,151
I'm on a covert mission.

369
00:16:10,153 --> 00:16:11,686
Not for long.

370
00:16:11,688 --> 00:16:15,023
You and your team are all 24
hours away from being killed.

371
00:16:15,025 --> 00:16:16,358
What are you talking about?

372
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,160
I'm a time traveler, remember?

373
00:16:19,162 --> 00:16:20,695
Something changes in the future,

374
00:16:20,697 --> 00:16:23,798
and you all die.

375
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,233
But if we do,

376
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:28,470
how do you know it's not
because of your team?

377
00:16:28,472 --> 00:16:30,972
Hadn't thought of that.

378
00:16:30,974 --> 00:16:32,474
Look who I found,

379
00:16:32,476 --> 00:16:33,875
and she's thrilled
we've offered our help.

380
00:16:33,877 --> 00:16:36,244
Herr Lorenz, I must introduce you

381
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:38,847
to General Gerd von Rundstedt.

382
00:16:38,849 --> 00:16:39,814
He's a huge fan.

383
00:16:39,816 --> 00:16:41,983
Oh, lovely to meet you, General.

384
00:16:41,985 --> 00:16:44,619
You are Max Lorenz?

385
00:16:44,621 --> 00:16:47,555
Lorenz is well over 6 feet tall.

386
00:16:47,557 --> 00:16:48,623
Ah.

387
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:51,593
My towering voice often causes people

388
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:54,696
to overestimate my height.

389
00:16:54,698 --> 00:16:58,299
Perhaps you will treat us
to a song, Mr. Lorenz?

390
00:16:58,301 --> 00:17:00,168
Maxie has a concert tomorrow night

391
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:02,871
and needs to rest his pipes.

392
00:17:02,873 --> 00:17:05,273
I insist, Fraulein.

393
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:08,243
And, uh, please,

394
00:17:08,245 --> 00:17:10,879
no Negro music.

395
00:17:10,881 --> 00:17:11,946
- I sw...
- Mm,

396
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,381
not worth it.

397
00:17:13,383 --> 00:17:15,917
It'd be a little worth it.

398
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,954
Heads up. Baron Krieger just arrived.

399
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:22,824
Is this on?

400
00:17:22,826 --> 00:17:26,127
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

401
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:28,663
My name is Max Lorenz,

402
00:17:28,665 --> 00:17:31,132
and, uh, this little waltz

403
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:32,634
I am about to sing for you

404
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:34,502
is an original song.

405
00:17:34,504 --> 00:17:37,238
Uh, very popular in Austria

406
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,641
where... where the hills are alive

407
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:42,444
with the sound of music.

408
00:17:43,913 --> 00:17:45,079
Key of A.

409
00:17:45,081 --> 00:17:46,181
Watch me for the changes

410
00:17:46,183 --> 00:17:47,882
and try to keep up.

411
00:17:49,752 --> 00:17:52,921
One, two, three. One, two, three.

412
00:17:58,128 --> 00:18:04,232
♪ Edelweiss, Edelweiss ♪

413
00:18:04,234 --> 00:18:07,101

414
00:18:07,103 --> 00:18:10,104

♪ You look happy to meet me ♪

418
00:18:22,452 --> 00:18:24,919
No, no, Herr Krieger, please.

419
00:18:24,921 --> 00:18:28,490
The Askaran Amulet is
not degenerate artwork.

420
00:18:28,492 --> 00:18:30,391
It is a masterpiece.

421
00:18:30,393 --> 00:18:32,193
Which you will help my men transport

422
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:35,630
to the exchange tomorrow at 01000.

423
00:18:35,632 --> 00:18:39,000
Refusing would meet with
the Fuehrer's disapproval.

424
00:18:39,002 --> 00:18:40,502
♪ Edelweiss ♪

425
00:18:40,504 --> 00:18:41,836
I know the Baron's plan.

426
00:18:41,838 --> 00:18:43,238
Let's get out of here.

427
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,274
Hey.

428
00:18:46,276 --> 00:18:50,345

429
00:18:50,347 --> 00:18:57,185

Heil Hitler!

431
00:19:05,862 --> 00:19:07,295
Heil Hitler!

432
00:19:09,632 --> 00:19:11,599
You did not salute the Fuehrer.

433
00:19:11,601 --> 00:19:13,101
Oh, yeah. Sure, I did.

434
00:19:13,103 --> 00:19:15,203
I'm all about saluting the Fuehrer.

435
00:19:15,205 --> 00:19:16,538
You're lying.

436
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,406
I was watching you the entire time.

437
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:20,454
Uh, you know what? I... I just...

438
00:19:20,455 --> 00:19:21,276
I have a little crick in my neck,

439
00:19:21,278 --> 00:19:24,946
and it's really hard for
me to straighten my arm.

440
00:19:24,948 --> 00:19:27,949
Heil Hitler.

441
00:19:27,951 --> 00:19:29,817
Heil Hitler!

442
00:19:31,287 --> 00:19:33,087
H...

443
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:34,422
h...

444
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:36,324
Ha...

445
00:19:36,326 --> 00:19:38,059
Ha... aw, hell.

446
00:19:39,563 --> 00:19:41,362
Why do you get to punch him?

447
00:19:44,901 --> 00:19:46,134
Protect Max Lorenz!

448
00:20:10,327 --> 00:20:13,361
What the hell are you doing here?

449
00:20:13,363 --> 00:20:16,831
We came back to...

450
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,099
to rescue you.

451
00:20:28,796 --> 00:20:31,319
If we're meant to be impressed
by all this technology,

452
00:20:31,895 --> 00:20:33,495
it has the opposite effect.

453
00:20:33,497 --> 00:20:35,397
It only makes you that
much more dangerous.

454
00:20:35,399 --> 00:20:37,298
Well, and there's evidence
to support that,

455
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,733
but I think what's important now

456
00:20:38,735 --> 00:20:40,235
is for all us to stop arguing.

457
00:20:40,237 --> 00:20:41,836
Does your team ever stop arguing?

458
00:20:41,838 --> 00:20:43,171
Fair point.

459
00:20:43,173 --> 00:20:44,939
I think what Martin is trying to say

460
00:20:44,941 --> 00:20:47,008
is we're gonna help you
whether you like it or not.

461
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,810
You're going after Krieger.

462
00:20:48,812 --> 00:20:50,478
We know where he's going next.

463
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,314
And given the laws of
temporal mechanics,

464
00:20:53,316 --> 00:20:54,516
if you die,

465
00:20:54,518 --> 00:20:56,217
your grandson ceases to exist.

466
00:20:56,219 --> 00:20:57,819
Well, I don't pretend
to understand any of

467
00:20:57,821 --> 00:21:00,955
this time travel bunk,
but these fellas do have a timeship.

468
00:21:00,957 --> 00:21:02,424
Might come in handy.

469
00:21:02,426 --> 00:21:04,826
And having them as our
back-up might be the only way

470
00:21:04,828 --> 00:21:06,561
to keep them out of trouble.

471
00:21:06,563 --> 00:21:07,696
Let's put it to a vote, then.

472
00:21:10,701 --> 00:21:13,168
The ayes have it.

473
00:21:15,071 --> 00:21:17,739
Did your reconnaissance at the
club yield any usable intel?

474
00:21:17,741 --> 00:21:18,940
Only to map the area.

475
00:21:18,942 --> 00:21:20,508
Bringing one online now.

476
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,943
- What was that?
- AI.

477
00:21:21,945 --> 00:21:23,645
A talking computer.

478
00:21:23,647 --> 00:21:24,979
What's a computer?

479
00:21:24,981 --> 00:21:26,581
There. The Fontainebleau Forest.

480
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:29,050
Now, I saw a few of Krieger's
men studying a map of it.

481
00:21:29,052 --> 00:21:30,552
That must be where Krieger's planning on

482
00:21:30,554 --> 00:21:31,920
making the exchange.

483
00:21:31,922 --> 00:21:34,089
Nate overheard Krieger talking about

484
00:21:34,091 --> 00:21:35,356
making a trade for something

485
00:21:35,358 --> 00:21:36,991
called an Askaran Amulet.

486
00:21:36,993 --> 00:21:38,393
Hitler has long amassed

487
00:21:38,395 --> 00:21:40,061
ancient artifacts such as this one.

488
00:21:40,063 --> 00:21:41,663
He may want the amulet
because it conveys

489
00:21:41,665 --> 00:21:43,198
some sort of occult power.

490
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,866
Our objective should
be to take out the Baron

491
00:21:44,868 --> 00:21:46,501
and stop this exchange at all costs.

492
00:21:46,503 --> 00:21:49,671
I propose we survey all
military activity in the area

493
00:21:49,673 --> 00:21:51,206
to learn what we're up against.

494
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:52,373
We don't have time for that.

495
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:53,408
I concur.

496
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:54,646
We should have both teams gear up while

497
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:56,277
Dr. Stein and I finalize the details.

498
00:21:56,279 --> 00:21:59,114
Be ready to go at first light.

499
00:22:03,252 --> 00:22:05,253
How are things with your grandfather?

500
00:22:05,255 --> 00:22:07,489
You know, I think he's
avoiding me for some reason.

501
00:22:07,491 --> 00:22:10,024
Well, it's hard for people
to look at their future.

502
00:22:10,026 --> 00:22:11,026
Maybe.

503
00:22:12,895 --> 00:22:16,431
Oh, one of the Nazis at
the club had a knife.

504
00:22:16,433 --> 00:22:19,134
Well, that should have
stopped bleeding by now.

505
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:21,369
I'm just gonna get a new bandage.

506
00:22:21,371 --> 00:22:24,439
To go with your bruise?

507
00:22:24,441 --> 00:22:27,342
Well, you know how fragile
we historians can be.

508
00:22:27,344 --> 00:22:28,977
This isn't fragility.

509
00:22:28,979 --> 00:22:32,347
I know my cuts and bruises.

510
00:22:32,349 --> 00:22:34,249
You're a hemophiliac.

511
00:22:34,251 --> 00:22:36,351
Your blood doesn't clot,
wounds can't heal,

512
00:22:36,353 --> 00:22:38,419
and if it's bad, you can bleed to death.

513
00:22:38,421 --> 00:22:40,155
Yeah, well, you don't have
to worry about that.

514
00:22:40,157 --> 00:22:41,055
Too late.

515
00:22:41,057 --> 00:22:42,724
You could've died tonight.

516
00:22:42,726 --> 00:22:44,492
But I didn't. In fact,
it was the opposite.

517
00:22:44,494 --> 00:22:46,828
I never felt more alive.

518
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:49,130
Look, when I was five years
old, I cut my knee,

519
00:22:49,132 --> 00:22:52,033
and my mother wouldn't let me
out of the house till I was 16.

520
00:22:52,035 --> 00:22:54,836
I'm a grown man.
I can make my own decisions.

521
00:22:54,838 --> 00:22:56,404
- Not on this ship, you can't.
- Sara...

522
00:22:56,406 --> 00:22:58,807
Look, I cannot let you
go out there tomorrow,

523
00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:00,608
knowing that you could get killed.

524
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:03,511
I have enough deaths on
my conscience as it is.

525
00:23:03,513 --> 00:23:07,215
Look, I know you don't think
I can add anything to this team,

526
00:23:07,217 --> 00:23:09,684
but out there? Out there is history.

527
00:23:09,686 --> 00:23:12,453
And nobody knows more about it than me.

528
00:23:12,455 --> 00:23:17,659
Well, we've been managing
just fine without you.

529
00:23:17,661 --> 00:23:19,060
Mostly fine.

530
00:23:23,332 --> 00:23:25,967
Your suit looks a bit cumbersome.

531
00:23:25,969 --> 00:23:29,137
Oh, actually, I made it
to fit me perfectly.

532
00:23:29,139 --> 00:23:31,272
It's constructed out
of a proprietary alloy,

533
00:23:31,274 --> 00:23:34,108
and it's been battle-tested quite a bit.

534
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:36,544
I even wore it in space once.

535
00:23:36,546 --> 00:23:37,912
Personal highlight.

536
00:23:37,914 --> 00:23:39,547
So your superpower is

537
00:23:39,549 --> 00:23:41,749
wearing the suit?

538
00:23:41,751 --> 00:23:43,284
Yeah, I guess so,

539
00:23:43,286 --> 00:23:47,188
it's a little more complicated
than that, but yeah.

540
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:48,623
You're still mad at me for punching out

541
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:50,158
that Nazi in the club, huh?

542
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,027
I'm mad because you blew my cover.

543
00:23:53,029 --> 00:23:57,031
I'll never be able to go
undercover in Paris ever again.

544
00:23:57,033 --> 00:23:59,934
Yeah, sorry, I didn't think about that.

545
00:23:59,936 --> 00:24:02,637
I imagine that's a pattern
with you and your group.

546
00:24:02,639 --> 00:24:04,038
But I can't dwell on it.

547
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,673
Getting stuck on past mistakes

548
00:24:05,675 --> 00:24:08,042
only takes focus off the
primary goal at hand.

549
00:24:08,044 --> 00:24:10,111
Well, I got to admit,
watching your team work

550
00:24:10,113 --> 00:24:12,413
like a well-oiled machine
kind of makes me feel

551
00:24:12,415 --> 00:24:14,849
like I'm doing this
whole hero thing wrong.

552
00:24:14,851 --> 00:24:17,385
If it's any consolation, Dr. Palmer,

553
00:24:17,387 --> 00:24:19,354
you're not really a hero.

554
00:24:20,489 --> 00:24:21,990
We better get ready.

555
00:24:31,601 --> 00:24:33,434
We've spotted the Baron's caravan.

556
00:24:33,436 --> 00:24:34,435
ETA five minutes.

557
00:25:08,137 --> 00:25:09,370
I've got eyes on the Baron.

558
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,080
What the hell's going on down there?

559
00:25:19,082 --> 00:25:20,815
Animal Girl and I are
going after Krieger.

560
00:25:20,817 --> 00:25:23,051
In the field, I'm called Vixen.

561
00:25:23,053 --> 00:25:24,085
Negative, Raymond.

562
00:25:24,087 --> 00:25:26,287
Our target is the convoy.

563
00:25:26,289 --> 00:25:28,823
We've got the convoy
covered. Pursue the Baron.

564
00:25:32,429 --> 00:25:34,696
The mission is the amulet.

565
00:25:34,698 --> 00:25:35,863
Our mission is Krieger.

566
00:25:35,865 --> 00:25:37,198
We don't have time for this.

567
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,833
Give me a moment. I... I...

568
00:25:38,835 --> 00:25:40,001
need to assess the situation.

569
00:25:40,003 --> 00:25:42,136
Krieger's getting away, man.

570
00:26:01,758 --> 00:26:03,024
What the hell was that?

571
00:26:05,662 --> 00:26:08,429
We're under attack.

572
00:26:08,431 --> 00:26:09,998
It's Krieger! He turned into a...

573
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,499
We need backup!

574
00:26:12,736 --> 00:26:15,603
Dr. Palmer? Vixen? Do you read?

575
00:26:15,605 --> 00:26:17,138
Their comms are down.

576
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,606
Oh, my God.

577
00:26:33,323 --> 00:26:34,522
I've got the amulet.

578
00:26:34,524 --> 00:26:35,556
Good work.

579
00:26:35,558 --> 00:26:37,058
Dr. Mid-Nite, Stargirl,

580
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,260
Vixen and Dr. Palmer need assistance.

581
00:26:39,262 --> 00:26:40,328
Copy that.

582
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:42,030
But I think we have a new problem.

583
00:26:52,141 --> 00:26:53,841
Grey, you got to get 'em out of there!

584
00:26:53,843 --> 00:26:55,143
I just need a minute.

585
00:27:00,617 --> 00:27:02,650
Come on, Grey! Do something!

586
00:27:02,652 --> 00:27:04,352
Uh...

587
00:27:04,354 --> 00:27:06,287
Fall back. Get Obsidian.

588
00:27:06,289 --> 00:27:08,589
Mick, lay down fire to cover our retreat.

589
00:27:08,591 --> 00:27:12,326
Now you're talking.

590
00:27:14,731 --> 00:27:16,531
Mick! Come on!

591
00:27:16,533 --> 00:27:19,133
Uh... Commander Steel, do...
do you still have the amulet?

592
00:27:19,135 --> 00:27:21,069
Yes, sir! En route to your position.

593
00:27:21,071 --> 00:27:22,570
What about Ray and Amaya?

594
00:27:22,572 --> 00:27:23,704
You just can't leave 'em there.

595
00:27:23,706 --> 00:27:25,073
Nor can we engage this super-Nazi.

596
00:27:25,075 --> 00:27:27,008
Not without compiling
more information first.

597
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:28,743
This is not a science debate, Grey!

598
00:27:28,745 --> 00:27:31,079
Damn it! Jefferson, I know that!

599
00:27:31,081 --> 00:27:33,581
But for now, they're on their own.

600
00:27:44,678 --> 00:27:49,080
I must admit, it's a feat of engineering.

601
00:27:49,082 --> 00:27:51,215
Far beyond anything I have ever seen

602
00:27:51,217 --> 00:27:55,119
or expected from you Americans.

603
00:27:55,121 --> 00:27:56,554
Well, maybe you Germans

604
00:27:56,556 --> 00:27:58,423
should just stick to your luxury cars.

605
00:27:58,425 --> 00:28:01,059
Why should I fear a robot suit

606
00:28:01,061 --> 00:28:03,294
when I have become der Ubermensch?

607
00:28:03,296 --> 00:28:05,129
You really think a single case

608
00:28:05,131 --> 00:28:07,765
of 'roid rage is gonna win you the war?

609
00:28:07,767 --> 00:28:09,767
Yeah.

610
00:28:09,769 --> 00:28:11,903
Once I have replicated the super-serum

611
00:28:11,905 --> 00:28:14,105
for the entire Wehrmacht.

612
00:28:14,107 --> 00:28:16,140
But you haven't replicated the...

613
00:28:16,142 --> 00:28:18,209
what'd you call it? Super-serum?

614
00:28:18,211 --> 00:28:19,711
Kind of on the nose, don't you think?

615
00:28:19,713 --> 00:28:22,180
If all this is just a
preamble to you killing us,

616
00:28:22,182 --> 00:28:23,581
get it over with.

617
00:28:25,251 --> 00:28:29,120
I was hoping to torture
you a little bit first,

618
00:28:29,122 --> 00:28:30,855
but since you're in such a rush,

619
00:28:30,857 --> 00:28:32,223
I will be glad to accommodate you

620
00:28:32,225 --> 00:28:33,524
with your schedule.

621
00:28:33,526 --> 00:28:34,692
Wait, wait.

622
00:28:34,694 --> 00:28:35,893
I'm a scientist.

623
00:28:35,895 --> 00:28:38,229
That exo-suit? I invented it.

624
00:28:38,231 --> 00:28:40,965
I can help you with your little
supply and demand problem.

625
00:28:40,967 --> 00:28:42,500
I'll even improve it.

626
00:28:42,502 --> 00:28:44,836
Just don't shoot her.

627
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,709
I hope you are as
smart as you say you are,

628
00:28:51,711 --> 00:28:53,911
for her sake.

629
00:29:00,887 --> 00:29:02,286
You know he's gonna kill us both

630
00:29:02,288 --> 00:29:05,289
even if you help him.

631
00:29:05,291 --> 00:29:06,691
I have a plan.

632
00:29:06,693 --> 00:29:09,427
That's what I'm afraid of.

633
00:29:09,429 --> 00:29:11,729
We have the amulet. Now what?

634
00:29:11,731 --> 00:29:14,432
First priority is making
sure Ray and Amaya are alive,

635
00:29:14,434 --> 00:29:16,100
and then getting them out of the bunker

636
00:29:16,102 --> 00:29:17,568
where the Nazis are holding them.

637
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:19,370
Actually, our first priority
is destroying the Baron

638
00:29:19,372 --> 00:29:21,806
and whatever serum is
making him indestructible.

639
00:29:21,808 --> 00:29:23,341
Perhaps we could propose a trade.

640
00:29:23,343 --> 00:29:25,143
Their lives for the Amulet.

641
00:29:25,145 --> 00:29:26,778
Unfortunately, the amulet's
not ours to barter with.

642
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,546
We need an extraction plan.

643
00:29:28,548 --> 00:29:30,415
We need to eliminate the threat.

644
00:29:30,417 --> 00:29:32,183
Now, Professor Stein, please, tell us,

645
00:29:32,185 --> 00:29:34,352
what is your plan of action?

646
00:29:34,354 --> 00:29:36,187
How... how am I supposed
to come up with a plan

647
00:29:36,189 --> 00:29:40,191
when I can't even hear myself think?

648
00:29:40,193 --> 00:29:42,060
Would... would you please all just leave?

649
00:29:42,062 --> 00:29:45,196
I... I need a moment
to collect my thoughts.

650
00:29:52,971 --> 00:29:54,439
What the hell, Grey?

651
00:29:54,441 --> 00:29:56,841
I can practically feel you
going crazy inside my head.

652
00:29:56,843 --> 00:29:58,142
I'm fine,

653
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:59,744
Jefferson, I'm trying to determine

654
00:29:59,746 --> 00:30:00,978
the best course of action.

655
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,213
I wouldn't believe that even if

656
00:30:02,215 --> 00:30:03,781
we didn't have a psychic connection,

657
00:30:03,783 --> 00:30:06,217
which... hold on... we do.

658
00:30:06,219 --> 00:30:09,854
I just don't know how Rip
was able to do all this.

659
00:30:09,856 --> 00:30:12,723
So many decisions to make,
consequences to manage,

660
00:30:12,725 --> 00:30:14,199
opinions to consider.

661
00:30:14,388 --> 00:30:16,455
Trying to reach a
consensus with this team

662
00:30:16,457 --> 00:30:18,631
is like something akin to chaos theory.

663
00:30:18,632 --> 00:30:19,619
That's the thing, Grey.

664
00:30:19,621 --> 00:30:21,587
We don't need someone
to reach a consensus.

665
00:30:21,589 --> 00:30:23,656
We just need someone
who can call the shots.

666
00:30:23,658 --> 00:30:25,625
Then you should have put a tactician,

667
00:30:25,627 --> 00:30:27,927
not a theoretician, in charge.

668
00:30:27,929 --> 00:30:30,196
You were right, Jefferson.

669
00:30:30,198 --> 00:30:33,432
I'm not a wartime consigliere.

670
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,875
Are they gonna be okay?

671
00:30:42,877 --> 00:30:44,844
They'll live to fight another day.

672
00:30:44,846 --> 00:30:47,246
It's what we do.

673
00:30:47,248 --> 00:30:49,215
I used to fantasize about meeting you.

674
00:30:50,785 --> 00:30:53,886
Trading stories or having a beer.

675
00:30:55,123 --> 00:30:58,291
Or just making eye contact.

676
00:30:58,293 --> 00:31:01,627
I'm sorry, I, uh,

677
00:31:01,629 --> 00:31:05,498
I guess back at, uh, headquarters,

678
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,667
I was afraid to get too close to you.

679
00:31:07,669 --> 00:31:09,702
Why? You're my grandfather.

680
00:31:09,704 --> 00:31:12,038
You're... you're more than that.
You're a hero to me.

681
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,473
I don't want to be anyone's hero.

682
00:31:14,475 --> 00:31:16,776
That look you gave me
when we first met,

683
00:31:16,778 --> 00:31:18,978
I've seen it before,

684
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:21,547
when people look up to me,

685
00:31:21,549 --> 00:31:23,382
decide that they have
to act a certain way,

686
00:31:23,384 --> 00:31:26,085
a way that's likely to get them killed.

687
00:31:29,157 --> 00:31:31,057
I do what I do

688
00:31:31,059 --> 00:31:33,192
so that others don't have to.

689
00:31:33,194 --> 00:31:34,627
So you wouldn't have to.

690
00:31:34,629 --> 00:31:36,362
My whole life, people
have been trying to

691
00:31:36,364 --> 00:31:41,100
shield me from the
world, your son included.

692
00:31:41,102 --> 00:31:46,138
Meanwhile, all I ever wanted
to be was a soldier, like you.

693
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,140
It's a parent's job

694
00:31:48,142 --> 00:31:50,142
to protect their child,

695
00:31:50,144 --> 00:31:52,011
but it's a child's obligation
to themselves

696
00:31:52,013 --> 00:31:54,213
to live their own life.

697
00:31:54,215 --> 00:31:56,315
You can and should

698
00:31:56,317 --> 00:31:59,318
do whatever you set your mind to.

699
00:32:03,124 --> 00:32:05,291
But you should know,

700
00:32:05,293 --> 00:32:06,892
you don't have to be a soldier

701
00:32:06,894 --> 00:32:09,528
to be a hero.

702
00:32:13,401 --> 00:32:15,468
And we approach from the southwest,

703
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:17,703
destroy the weapons lab
and the Baron in one move.

704
00:32:17,705 --> 00:32:19,238
Except for the last time we faced him,

705
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,539
he took out both of our teams.

706
00:32:20,541 --> 00:32:21,874
The last time, we weren't being backed

707
00:32:21,876 --> 00:32:23,442
by a squadron of B-17s.

708
00:32:23,444 --> 00:32:25,044
Then how do we get Ray and Amaya out

709
00:32:25,046 --> 00:32:26,646
before the bombs start falling?

710
00:32:26,648 --> 00:32:27,880
We don't.

711
00:32:29,317 --> 00:32:31,517
This conflict is bigger
than any one of us.

712
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,452
If it means ending the
war one day sooner,

713
00:32:33,454 --> 00:32:35,855
Amaya would happily make that sacrifice.

714
00:32:35,857 --> 00:32:37,590
But she doesn't have to.

715
00:32:37,592 --> 00:32:39,725
Look, I know you and your team think

716
00:32:39,727 --> 00:32:41,894
we're a group of irresponsible losers,

717
00:32:41,896 --> 00:32:43,195
but I know Ray Palmer,

718
00:32:43,197 --> 00:32:45,431
and he has a plan to
get out of that bunker.

719
00:32:45,433 --> 00:32:47,102
We just need to give him time...

720
00:32:47,103 --> 00:32:49,201
Which means giving the Nazis time.

721
00:32:49,203 --> 00:32:51,070
I'm calling in the strike.

722
00:32:51,072 --> 00:32:52,305
I can't let you do that.

723
00:32:52,307 --> 00:32:53,906
You don't have the authority.

724
00:32:53,908 --> 00:32:57,376
Yes, she does.

725
00:32:57,378 --> 00:32:59,312
Miss Lance speaks for all of us.

726
00:32:59,314 --> 00:33:01,314
I have watched her
become the beating heart

727
00:33:01,316 --> 00:33:04,083
and steady hand of this team.

728
00:33:04,085 --> 00:33:07,186
She is the proper person to lead us.

729
00:33:07,188 --> 00:33:08,287
And if she says that we are

730
00:33:08,289 --> 00:33:11,057
going to rescue our people,

731
00:33:11,059 --> 00:33:13,426
that is what we are going to do.

732
00:33:23,422 --> 00:33:26,356
This would go a lot faster
if I wasn't handcuffed.

733
00:33:26,358 --> 00:33:27,824
I mean, what do you
think, I'm gonna escape

734
00:33:27,826 --> 00:33:30,460
using a microscope?

735
00:33:30,462 --> 00:33:34,064
Are you going to make more serum,

736
00:33:34,066 --> 00:33:36,433
or is your friend going to die?

737
00:33:36,435 --> 00:33:38,535
First off, it's not a serum.

738
00:33:38,537 --> 00:33:40,570
It's a biomolecular enhancer.

739
00:33:40,572 --> 00:33:41,738
By the way, who gave you this?

740
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,840
Because from an engineering standpoint,

741
00:33:43,842 --> 00:33:45,242
it's really rather ama...

742
00:33:45,244 --> 00:33:47,844
Yes. I can make more.

743
00:33:47,846 --> 00:33:51,014
Ray, don't do it.

744
00:33:51,016 --> 00:33:52,115
Don't help him.

745
00:33:58,756 --> 00:34:00,757
Back to work.

746
00:34:07,098 --> 00:34:11,001
Watch them.

747
00:34:11,003 --> 00:34:12,669
How can you do this?

748
00:34:12,671 --> 00:34:16,306
No member of the JSA
would ever help the Nazis.

749
00:34:16,308 --> 00:34:18,842
Neither would a Legend.

750
00:34:24,116 --> 00:34:26,950
Damn, I really wanted to do
it with just the microscope.

751
00:34:26,952 --> 00:34:28,185
Get the handcuff keys.

752
00:34:30,822 --> 00:34:33,390
Alpha-stabilizer's damaged.

753
00:34:33,392 --> 00:34:34,958
Suit's not gonna work.

754
00:34:37,062 --> 00:34:38,495
They took my amulet.

755
00:34:38,497 --> 00:34:40,263
And without it,
I'm guessing you're just...

756
00:34:40,265 --> 00:34:41,464
A 5th-degree black belt,

757
00:34:41,466 --> 00:34:43,200
with training in edged weapons combat.

758
00:34:43,202 --> 00:34:44,901
Nice, but

759
00:34:44,903 --> 00:34:47,404
I think we'll need more than
that to get past super-Krieger.

760
00:34:47,406 --> 00:34:48,572
What are you doing?

761
00:34:48,574 --> 00:34:50,240
I told you I had a plan.

762
00:34:50,242 --> 00:34:52,509
It was to get my hands on this

763
00:34:52,511 --> 00:34:55,178
and enhance it, but not for them.

764
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:57,414
I'm not only a man in a metal suit.

765
00:34:57,416 --> 00:34:59,416
At least not after this.

766
00:35:02,554 --> 00:35:04,321
We are under attack.

767
00:35:04,323 --> 00:35:06,256
Baron Krieger has ordered
us to transport you

768
00:35:06,258 --> 00:35:07,924
to a more secure location.

769
00:35:07,926 --> 00:35:09,392
Who's attacking you?

770
00:35:09,394 --> 00:35:11,561
Sir, the sentries are reporting

771
00:35:11,563 --> 00:35:13,663
a man made of fire flying
through the forest.

772
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,633
Lock down the base.

773
00:35:16,635 --> 00:35:17,734
Now.

774
00:35:41,692 --> 00:35:44,194
Firestorm is drawing the
troops away from the bunker.

775
00:35:44,196 --> 00:35:45,462
Copy that.

776
00:35:45,464 --> 00:35:48,098
We still need to find Ray and Amaya.

777
00:35:50,836 --> 00:35:52,102
Mick, look out!

778
00:35:55,941 --> 00:35:57,474
Thanks, Haircut.

779
00:35:57,476 --> 00:36:00,277
I believe this belongs to you.

780
00:36:02,514 --> 00:36:05,248
Steel, Mid-Nite, we've
recovered the rest of the team.

781
00:36:07,085 --> 00:36:09,786
I suggest you save the
teary reunion for later.

782
00:36:09,788 --> 00:36:12,155
Hourman ordered the bombers to strike.

783
00:36:12,157 --> 00:36:13,890
They're five minutes out.

784
00:36:17,262 --> 00:36:19,396
But Herr Krieger is here right now!

785
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:32,242
Come on, you Nazi bastard.

786
00:36:50,361 --> 00:36:52,362
- Get on!
- What are you doing here?

787
00:36:52,364 --> 00:36:54,497
Saving you! Get on!

788
00:37:09,413 --> 00:37:10,980
Bombing run about to commence.

789
00:37:10,982 --> 00:37:12,382
All points, get clear.

790
00:37:12,384 --> 00:37:13,950
Working on it!

791
00:37:28,933 --> 00:37:30,300
What was that?

792
00:37:30,302 --> 00:37:31,668
He's dead.

793
00:37:32,571 --> 00:37:34,371
You did it. You saved us!

794
00:37:52,706 --> 00:37:55,301
I'm afraid Mr. Heywood's
vitals are dropping.

795
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:57,486
There's got to be something on board
this tub to get him back on his feet.

796
00:37:57,487 --> 00:37:59,093
You people are from the future,
for God's sake!

797
00:37:59,094 --> 00:38:01,521
The bomb blast caused
massive internal bleeding,

798
00:38:01,522 --> 00:38:03,863
and because his body lacks
the normal clotting factor,

799
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:05,598
there's only so much Gideon can do!

800
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:10,269
Were you two close?

801
00:38:10,271 --> 00:38:12,105
No, not really,

802
00:38:12,107 --> 00:38:13,639
but if it wasn't for Nate,
I'd still be trapped

803
00:38:13,641 --> 00:38:14,907
in the Cretaceous period,

804
00:38:14,909 --> 00:38:18,277
being chased by a T. rex.

805
00:38:18,279 --> 00:38:19,812
I'm sorry.

806
00:38:19,814 --> 00:38:22,315
This is our fight, not yours.

807
00:38:22,317 --> 00:38:24,450
- The Nazis are not...
- Nazis.

808
00:38:24,452 --> 00:38:26,686
Nazis.

809
00:38:26,688 --> 00:38:27,854
You kept the serum?

810
00:38:27,856 --> 00:38:29,355
There may be enough.

811
00:38:31,659 --> 00:38:33,793
I think I can save him, with this.

812
00:38:33,795 --> 00:38:35,595
Is that the Nazi serum that created

813
00:38:35,597 --> 00:38:37,864
that hideous berserker? Are you mad?

814
00:38:37,866 --> 00:38:39,732
I did a little tinkering
tothe formula, so...

815
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,267
So what will it do now?

816
00:38:41,269 --> 00:38:43,336
With any luck, save his life.

817
00:38:43,338 --> 00:38:45,204
How do we know if it's working?

818
00:38:45,206 --> 00:38:47,273
He's not dead yet, so that's a good sign.

819
00:38:47,275 --> 00:38:49,775
And he's not turning
into a Nazi berserker.

820
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:52,411
His vitals are improving.

821
00:38:53,515 --> 00:38:56,249
He's stabilizing.

822
00:39:00,121 --> 00:39:03,923
What'd the Nazis want with
a piece of jewelry anyway?

823
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:05,224
No idea.

824
00:39:05,226 --> 00:39:08,394
Hitler's known to be
obsessed with the strange.

825
00:39:08,396 --> 00:39:10,062
We'll keep it safe, in any case.

826
00:39:10,064 --> 00:39:12,865
I guess that's your
way of saying thanks.

827
00:39:12,867 --> 00:39:15,067
Right, well, I think it's time

828
00:39:15,069 --> 00:39:17,170
we got out of 1942.

829
00:39:17,172 --> 00:39:18,504
This was fun.

830
00:39:18,506 --> 00:39:22,041
It was unusual.

831
00:39:22,043 --> 00:39:23,476
Hey,

832
00:39:23,478 --> 00:39:24,744
I wanted to

833
00:39:24,746 --> 00:39:27,680
apologize for what I said.

834
00:39:27,682 --> 00:39:29,682
About me not being a hero?

835
00:39:29,684 --> 00:39:31,651
You're not a superhero,

836
00:39:31,653 --> 00:39:34,253
but what you did for Nate,

837
00:39:34,255 --> 00:39:35,421
giving him the serum,

838
00:39:35,423 --> 00:39:38,357
giving up your chance at real powers,

839
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:39,759
that was heroic.

840
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,903
Oh, it's about time, Sleeping Beauty.

841
00:39:50,905 --> 00:39:52,672
I was afraid you wouldn't wake up in time

842
00:39:52,674 --> 00:39:53,940
for me to say good-bye.

843
00:39:53,942 --> 00:39:57,043
And here I was afraid

844
00:39:57,045 --> 00:40:00,246
I wasn't gonna wake up at all.

845
00:40:00,248 --> 00:40:01,747
I was afraid of that too.

846
00:40:04,585 --> 00:40:06,552
I'm sorry if I didn't

847
00:40:06,554 --> 00:40:09,121
live up to the version
of Commander Steel

848
00:40:09,123 --> 00:40:12,124
you dreamt of meeting.

849
00:40:12,126 --> 00:40:14,627
Nah, I like the real version better.

850
00:40:17,632 --> 00:40:19,198
Well, I'll be damned.

851
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:27,473
Guess this means we're
both gonna make it.

852
00:40:27,475 --> 00:40:30,243
Not bad for a historian.

853
00:40:30,245 --> 00:40:32,178
Not bad for a hero.

854
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:49,762
Hello, Rex.

855
00:40:49,764 --> 00:40:50,730
Who are you?

856
00:40:50,732 --> 00:40:52,031
Oh, we've met before.

857
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:53,833
Quite a number of times, actually.

858
00:40:53,835 --> 00:40:56,369
In fact, after our last go,
you discovered my plan

859
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:58,170
and then traveled through time yourself

860
00:40:58,172 --> 00:41:00,072
to stop the Legends from coming here.

861
00:41:00,074 --> 00:41:02,441
They... they said I disappeared.

862
00:41:02,443 --> 00:41:03,943
Not disappeared.

863
00:41:03,945 --> 00:41:04,777
No.

864
00:41:04,779 --> 00:41:06,779
Erased from the timeline.

865
00:41:08,283 --> 00:41:09,482
Like this.

866
00:41:09,484 --> 00:41:11,083
No.

867
00:41:19,594 --> 00:41:20,593
Rex?

868
00:41:21,596 --> 00:41:23,253
Rex?

869
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:25,598
Rex.

870
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,334
Rex, no.

871
00:41:28,336 --> 00:41:31,003
Time...

872
00:41:31,005 --> 00:41:33,239
time traveler.

873
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:35,508
No.

874
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:36,876
Rex.

875
00:41:43,143 --> 00:41:48,102
