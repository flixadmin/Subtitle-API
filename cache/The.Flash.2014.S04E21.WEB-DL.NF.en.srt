- Council of Wells.

3
00:00:03,044 --> 00:00:04,588
- Some of the brightest minds
in all the multiverse.

4
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:05,673
- There's still another

5
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:07,466
cryogenic anomaly in my DNA.

6
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:08,801
- Killer Frost is still
a part of you.

<i>- The more I try
to use my brain,</i>

8
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,262
the sooner
I'm going to lose it.

9
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:14,389
- I know what DeVoe's doing.
- Separate satellites working

10
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:15,808
together for a single purpose?

11
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,267
- DeVoe wants to remove
the intelligence

12
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:18,268
of everyone on Earth?

13
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:19,311
- Just like mine.

19
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:47,464
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

20
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:49,008
Just one second.
Let me just...

21
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:51,844
let me just get this
last sentence down, okay?

22
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:54,054
- Why...why are you still awake?
What is all this?

23
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:56,139
- This is...

24
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:58,350
every file, every report,
every footnote

25
00:00:58,392 --> 00:00:59,935
that I could find on DeVoe.
I dug it all up

26
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:01,520
when I woke up
in the middle of the night.

27
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,898
I just...I couldn't
stop thinking about DeVoe

28
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:05,816
and his machine.

29
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:07,359
And now that he has
all of the satellites,

30
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,277
I mean, he could turn on
the machine at any point.

31
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,030
And not knowing is maddening,

32
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,365
but at least I know
what he's planned, right?

33
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,826
But everyone else in the city,
they are oblivious.

34
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:19,204
Which is why I decided
that I need to write

35
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,289
a piece about it.

36
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:24,626
- An article?
- Exposing every single detail

37
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:25,878
of his maniacal plan.

38
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,504
- Oh...
- I think that if people

39
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:28,881
in this city knew
what he was up to,

40
00:01:28,923 --> 00:01:30,507
then maybe they could
protect themselves.

41
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:32,009
Barry,
I really think

42
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:33,427
this is exactly
what we need

43
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:34,803
to change the tide
against DeVoe.

44
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:36,430
So I'm gonna go upstairs,

45
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:37,932
I'm gonna take a shower,
and when I come back,

46
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:39,182
I need you to tell me
everything you know about

47
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,726
that flying chair

48
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:42,728
and how he uses it
to body hop and...

49
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,855
- [sighs]

50
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,529
- So last night,
Harry, Cisco, and I

51
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:54,155
were up all night writing
all the different algorithms

52
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,490
we could think of involving

53
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,076
the satellite tech
that DeVoe stole.

54
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,119
- We think DeVoe plans
to position each

55
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,496
of his five satellites
at specifically calculated

56
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,331
points around the globe.
- And when the quantum computers

57
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:04,792
in each satellite
link up...

58
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,586
- He'll use that network
to basically emit

59
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,088
a series
of dark matter bursts.

60
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,172
- That will reboot
the pre-frontal cortex

61
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,759
of every man, woman, and child
on this Earth.

62
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:15,427
- Well, we need
to nip this in the bud.

63
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,220
We can't let him
launch those satellites.

64
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,598
- Yeah, but I mean, how are we
supposed to find him?

65
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,141
I mean, we haven't
been able to register

66
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:23,143
DeVoe's pocket dimension energy
for days.

67
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:25,020
- And with Null's
gravitational powers,

68
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:28,023
he can launch these satellites
from any place at any time.

69
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:29,566
- Yeah, he can.

70
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:31,068
- What are you thinking,
Bar?

71
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,527
- I think we shoot 'em down.

72
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,655
- Whoa.
- There is one small problem.

73
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,991
DeVoe has Kilg%re's powers.

74
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:39,118
- Yeah, he can manipulate
any tech-based weapon

75
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,119
we fire at him.

76
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,370
- So we don't use tech.

77
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,915
We use some kind
of organic matter weapon.

78
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:47,001
- Right, like a...

79
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:49,294
[stammering] Like a...

80
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,505
- You know what?
Let's split up,

81
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,214
see what we can find.

82
00:02:56,135 --> 00:02:58,553
- Ramon.

83
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,599
DeVoe's not acting.
Why is he not acting?

84
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,768
- I don't know,
but it doesn't matter.

85
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,604
- But it does matter, though.
And if I had my intelligence,

86
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:09,314
I could figure that out.
But I don't.

87
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:10,816
I got to get it back.
- No, no, no.

88
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:12,442
What you need to do
is be patient.

89
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:13,735
We're consulting
with, like,

90
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,362
literally
every scientist we know.

91
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:16,530
- Why don't you
consult with me?

92
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:17,990
- No. Harry...

93
00:03:18,032 --> 00:03:21,952
- No, not dumb me,
the other mes.

94
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,164
- The council.

95
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:27,624
- So I must admit,
found your transmission

96
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,044
intriguing,
to say the least.

97
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:31,837
But first...

98
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:35,340
I have a question
for you, Harry Wells.

99
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:38,844
Tell me, Harry,
how does your "hypothetical"

100
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:40,971
thinking cap
account for

101
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:44,516
the resonant inductive coupling
of the dark matter transfer?

102
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:48,645
- Well, the...the inductive...
- Am I speaking to you?

103
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,856
I cannot remember.
Oh, wait. I'm not.

104
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:53,483
The little guy that must be
Cisco, put you in the box.

105
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:54,902
Put the box in the pocket.

106
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,528
Talking to Harry,
a simple question.

107
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:01,783
How does it account
for the resonant coupling?

108
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:04,119
- It, uh...

109
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:05,913
- Ah!

110
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:09,666
Ha! I knew it!
He doesn't know!

111
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,585
He doesn't know!

112
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:16,173
Ah! Simple Harry is truly
Simple Harry now.

113
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:18,299
- No. That's not what's hap...
<i>- Ja,</i> remember,</i>

114
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,843
I put you in the box.
Put the box in the pocket.

115
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:22,679
Crush the box!
In the pocket.

116
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,431
This is very simple
what has happened.

117
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:27,684
Your "hypothetical" thinking cap
has malfunctioned, hmm,

118
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:31,021
and left the world's
once formidable intellect

119
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:33,190
a dum-dum!

120
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:35,234
- That's not what happened.
- Yeah, that's what happened.

121
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,818
- That's what happened.

122
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,238
- Poor Harry.

123
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,614
- Herr Wells...
<i>- Ja.</i>

124
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:44,201
- Are you gonna
help us or not?

125
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:45,744
- Not.
- Why not?

126
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:48,455
- The Council of Wells
is a council

127
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:51,875
of superior intellects
there to accept the challenge

128
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:54,586
of others with
superior intellects.

129
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,213
It's called
the Council of Wells

130
00:04:56,255 --> 00:04:57,923
and not
the Council of Dum-Dums!

131
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,258
- Loot at this man.
- I see him.

132
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,968
- Is he not one of your own?

133
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,928
Are you telling me
you're gonna betray

134
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,513
one of your own because
he doesn't meet some

135
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,724
arbitrary intellectual
standard?

136
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,517
- Ah! So you do understand.

137
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,728
<i>Ja,</i> unlike your simple friend,</i>
here's what you

138
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,898
now must consider.

139
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,234
<i>Auf Wiedersehen!</i>

140
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:20,112
- No, he's right.
I am a dum-dum.

141
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:22,114
- Hey, you are not
a dum-dum.

142
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:24,158
- Ramon, come on.
Let's face facts.

143
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,034
I've lost most of my science,
lost most of my math.

144
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:27,786
Language will be next,
and there's nothing

145
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:30,538
we can do about it.
- On the contrary, "mon frery,"

146
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,041
we're the ones who created
that council of ding-dongs

147
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:36,086
in the first place, so if
they're not gonna help us,

148
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:37,963
that leaves us
with one other option.

149
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:42,259
A new council,
a smarter council.

150
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:43,802
A better council.

151
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,639
- Hey, Caitlin.
- Hmm?

152
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,474
- Do you have
any ibuprofen?

153
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,726
Reading up on
all this organic matter

154
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,645
has given me
an organic migraine.

155
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,647
Oh, thanks.

156
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,358
You have a little...

157
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,986
- Oh! Acupuncture.

158
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,445
Ever since I found out
I still have

159
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,198
a cryogenic anomaly

- Mm. You really do miss her,
don't you?

163
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,580
- Yeah. Killer Frost
was a part of me,

164
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,291
and just as I was starting
to accept her,

165
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,168
she was taken away.

166
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,585
I'm running out of ideas.

- Hmm, well,
I know it's not

168
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:23,175
exactly the same,
but I've had

my fair share
of missing persons cases.

170
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,928

Anyway, thanks.

I mean, she kidnapped you.

183
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,761
She tried to sell me
into meta slavery.

as big of a deal, but you know

187

- Yeah, we can't partner up

She's a criminal.

she'd be willing to help us?

00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:45,249
- Why don't I take you?
- [laughs]

472
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,755
- Boy.

473
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:54,759
- Oh, you prepare food in here?

474
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:56,844
It's not very sanitary.

475
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,763
- I wanted
to talk to you alone.

476
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:01,515
I didn't just bring you here
to help us stop DeVoe.

477
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:06,228
- An ulterior motive.
How furtive and apropos.

478
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,898
After all, why go through
all the hassle

479
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,984
of procuring me
when Killer Frost

480
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:13,277
could quite easily
just ice blast

481
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,446
those satellites down?

482
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:17,406
- Killer Frost is gone.
I haven't been able

483
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:18,908
to get her to appear
ever since DeVoe

484
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,576
used one of his powers on her.

485
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:22,662
Remember last year
when I came to you

486
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:25,205
because Killer Frost
was taking over?

487
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,499
You fixed me.

488
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,417
- Mm.

489
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:32,379
My transmodular
genetic splicer.

490
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,090
- I need to use
that splicer again.

491
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:36,801
- [tsking]
Caitie.

492
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:39,137
One of the reasons why
I was so willing to help

493
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:42,807
you and your friends
with your professor situation

494
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:46,268
is because, well,
quite literally...

495
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,271
it also benefits me.

496
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:54,819
But giving you my splicer,
not as beneficial.

497
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,822
- What if I make you a deal?

498
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:59,740
You give me the splicer.

499
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:03,285
Killer Frost and I
will do you one favor.

500
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:06,539
- Oh, that is a tempting offer.

501
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:10,835
But unfortunately my splicer
was stashed right alongside

502
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:12,211
my additional shards.

503
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,463
- In your
ransacked storage unit.

504
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:16,924
Okay, wherever we find
your shards,

505
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:18,509
we should also find
the splicer.

506
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,720
- Ding, ding, ding.
- So do we have a deal?

507
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:23,556
You'll give me the splicer
as soon as we recover it?

508
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:26,184
- I'll even tie
a little bow on it.

509
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,519
- Ladies and gentlemen,
hang on to your wigs and keys.

510
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:31,522
Here we go. Harry, turn to him,
the guy who must be Cisco.

511
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,983
Express yourself.
- Yes, it is best you commence

512
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:36,694
with the "I feel" statements.
- Mm.

513
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:40,280
- Wow, like "I feel a yearning"
or "I feel aroused."

514
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,033
- Okay, how...

515
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:44,118
how is this gonna make me
smarter than DeVoe?

516
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,536
- 'Ey! Again with DeVoe.

517
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,329
Why you so hung up
on this mamalooch?

518
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,957
- I think that DeVoe, for you,
this is a guy

519
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:52,085
that has...well,
he's like a leech

520
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:54,921
upon you,
sucking and sucking

521
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,923
and sucking and sucking
and sucking.

522
00:20:56,964 --> 00:21:00,093
And all you are left with...
is doubt.

523
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:02,762
- I like that. Nature,
red in tooth and claw.

524
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,722
You know, they say to understand
a man's actions,

525
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,015
you got to understand
his heart.

526
00:21:06,057 --> 00:21:08,226
- Oh, okay, question.

527
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:11,520
How do you understand
the heart

528
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:13,731
of a deranged maniac?

529
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,983
- That guy who must be Cisco
makes a good point here.

530
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:17,985
Let's all close our eyes and...

531
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:20,947
take a moment and imagine
that we are all sociopaths

532
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:24,450
trying to conquer the world.
- Ah, yes.

533
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,035
- [scoffs]
What is...

534
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:31,457
- Oh,<i>mais,</i> Harry.</i>
Go on,<i>allez.</i>

535
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:33,000
Put yourself in DeVoe's shoes.

536
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,585
- Close your eyes, Harry.

537
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:43,052
- Now what do you see?

538
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:45,012
[sniffs]
What do you smell?

539
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:47,098
How do you feel?

540
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,516
- Dumb. Dumb.

541
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,894
This is not
making me any smarter.

542
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:54,605
- But aren't you smarter,
Harry?

543
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:56,356
You must channel
your aggression

544
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:57,775
into love.

545
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,359
- I feel like
you're mocking me.

546
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:02,029
- Oh! An "I Feel" statement!
Winner, winner.

547
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:04,657
- All right, all right,
all right, progress!

548
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:07,451
On that note...
- Wait, wait.

549
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:09,287
We're not done here,
are we?

550
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,164
- Yeah, we're done,
- Yeah, we're done.

551
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:13,373
<i>- Oui, oui, c'est fini.</i>
- No, no, no.

552
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,709
Nothing's<i>fini.</i>
- Now, Harry...[laughs]

553
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,586
You know what they say
about all work and no play.

554
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:19,130
Leaves no time
for making whoopee.

555
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:20,380
[clicks tongue]

556
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,466
- And there he goes.

557
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:24,384
Look, H.P., come on,
we're not done.

558
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:27,013
We haven't done anything.
<i>- Non, non, mon frère, désolé.</i>

559
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:30,348
Parting, such sweet sorrow,
but I must bid you<i>adieu.</i>

560
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,810
Harry from Earth-2,
<i>adieu.</i>

561
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:37,023
- 'Ey, Harry,
everything you need...

562
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,398
you got it right in there.

563
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,320
Remember,
you're unbelievable.

564
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,572
- [sighs]
Ramon, remind me again...

565
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:50,036
what's...what's
another word for "huge"?

566
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,704
- "Colossal."

567
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,371
- Colossal.
Great, thank you.

568
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:58,544
This...was a colossal
waste of time!

569
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:02,840
[trash can rattling]

570
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:10,764
- Here we are.

571
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:13,351
- This is where you
kept your stash?

572
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:16,770
- Well, I got something.

573
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:19,357
Some kind of substance
on the lock pin.

574
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:21,775
Looks like they applied it
to break the door open.

575
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:25,487
- Young man, David Caruso's
got nothing on you.

576
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:26,697
- Thanks.
- [chuckles]

577
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:28,032
- [laughs]

578
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:34,538
- What is it?

579
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,499
Acid? Cyanide?

580
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,252
Oh, oh! Is it anthrax?

581
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:42,004
[gasps]

582
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:43,881
- Hematoxic venom.

583
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:51,138
- Oh, that grotty, manky,
plug-ugly prat dare betray me?

584
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,182
- I take it she knows
who did this.

585
00:23:53,224 --> 00:23:55,768
- Yep, and so do you.

586
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,811
Norvock.
- And I guarantee

587
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:00,773
that snake for brains
will suffer.

588
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:07,154
- If Norvock thinks
he can steal from me

589
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:09,698
and get away with it, he has got
another thing coming.

590
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,284
- I can't believe
this is happening.

591
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:13,286
- Satellite's not picking up
any of your alnico metal

592
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:15,453
anywhere in the city.
- Norvock may be a moron,

593
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:16,914
but he's not
stupid enough to keep

594
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:18,958
the stash out in the open.

595
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,335
- Hey, did you find anything?
- Nope.

596
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:23,296
Norvock and the boxers
weren't at the ring anymore.

597
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:24,838
- Of course not!

598
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,257
Because you and your gang
of heroes tipped him off

599
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:27,967
that something was up.

600
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,302
- Have you expanded
the satellite

601
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:30,552
beyond Central City?

602
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:31,929
- Yeah.
- What about trying

603
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:33,680
facial recognition?
- Yes, of course.

604
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:35,099
- And what about
a geological scan

605
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:36,725
of the metal signature
like last time

606
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:38,769
or having Cisco run another
algorithm to check

607
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,229
the electromagnetic fields
in the city?

608
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:42,064
- Yes, Caitlin.
I've done all that.

609
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:43,690
I've run all the tests.

610
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,359
- Bit testy with that, Frost.
Just...

611
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:46,902
- We're doing everything
we can, all right?

612
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:50,864
We're gonna find Norvock
and the shards.

613
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,699
- Caitlin.

614
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:55,369
Is this about
her stolen shards...

615
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:57,955
or her tech?

616
00:24:57,997 --> 00:24:59,623
- What?
What tech?

617
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:04,837
- Amunet has splicer technology
that she used

618
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,504
to split Killer Frost
last year.

619
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:08,799
I was hoping to use it again
to get Killer Frost

620
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:10,217
to come out, but...

621
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:12,219
it was hidden
with her metal shards

622
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:13,720
in the storage container.

623
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:16,265
- Why wouldn't you
tell us that?

624
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:18,184
- Because I made Amunet
a deal.

625
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:19,726
If she helped me,
Killer Frost would do

626
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,603
another job for her.

I have tried everything

629
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:27,318
that I can think of
to get Killer Frost to appear,

630
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,986

you were gonna...

636
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:52,301
What is this?
What are you doing?

637
00:25:52,343 --> 00:25:54,011
- I am cleaning up
my work station

638
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:55,429
because I'm not gonna
need it anymore since I'm not

639
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:57,014
getting my intelligence back.

Oh, I don't know that?

642

Ramon,
what's done is done.

643
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,855
You spent all this time
bringing this council together

644
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,648
when your time should have
been used helping the team.

645
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:10,236
I wasted your valuable time,
and for that...

646
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,569
I apologize.

647
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:19,036
What are you...
What?

648
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:20,620
Spill some soup on me?
- No, no, no.

649
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:24,750
It's just, that was...
that was very real.

650
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:27,669
That was, like, a very...
very genuine apology.

651
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:29,796
- Well, I meant it.

652
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,215
- Well, I can tell.
There's no snark.

653

You're not throwing anything.

I'm not. Hmm.

655
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:38,972
- The council might not
have helped your intelligence,

656
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:41,225
but I think they...

since I've been concerned

664
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:58,742

though, you know?

665
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:01,495
You know what?

666
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:04,164
Maybe it is time I consider
someone else's feelings.

667

Well, I feel...

668

669
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:10,588
- Right?
Maybe the council had a point.

670
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:14,049
The best way
for me to understand DeVoe...

671
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:16,051
put myself in his shoes.

672
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:17,261

were gonna say?

674
00:27:18,596 --> 00:27:19,930

Hey, anything on Norvock?

It's my finished article.

Barry, look,
I'm just as anxious as you are

681
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:41,701
about DeVoe,
but I really think

682
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,996
that we need to arm the citizens
with information,

683
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:46,957
not shield them from it.
- Iris, I'm just...

684
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:48,792
I'm trying to do what's best
for the city

685
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:50,836

- And look...

686
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:53,547
I think that telling the truth
is what's best.

687
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:55,508
I mean, if we give them
all of the facts to consider,

688

they will do the right thing.

about that?

690

- Look, Barry...

691
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:05,309
I can't deny that you've had
a tough year with DeVoe, but...

692
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:10,772
his entire goal is to take
information away from people.

693
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,149
If we don't publish
this article,

I think it's too risky.

697
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:20,199

you feel...

698
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,909
and I really want us to be
on the same page.

699
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:26,664
So...
it's your decision.

700
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:29,082
- Iris...
- I just want you to remember

701
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,834
that The Flash
is a beacon of hope

702
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:34,463
that the people have always
put their faith in.

703
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:35,964
And now it's time
for The Flash

704
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:38,467
to put his faith
in the people.

705

Ah, there you are.

I couldn't help but notice

Thought your color was blue,
not red.

I've been angry for weeks

709
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:56,902
and still no Killer Frost.

710
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:58,612
And now Norvock's
ruined everything.

711
00:28:58,654 --> 00:29:01,073
- Oh, Caitie.

712
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:04,117
I hate to see you
so torn up like this.

713
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,537
So I'm going
to tell you something

714
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:07,871
that will cheer you up.

rather than tell me that?

00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,608
- Mm!
But just because the splicer

726
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:37,359
didn't technically work
doesn't mean

727
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:38,985
that the results
were not the same.

Norvock is, in the abandoned

00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:04,670
I'm gonna look in a completely
different direction.

942
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:07,632
The key to finding Killer Frost
is not out there.

943
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:08,883
It's in here.

944
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:10,427
- Mm.

945
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:20,686

946
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,563
- Iris, what's happening?
- Barry?

947
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:24,190
- What?
- It's the city.

948
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:25,442
- What?
- I posted my article,

949
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,110
and they're responding.

950
00:41:27,152 --> 00:41:28,569
- What do you mean?
They believed you?

951
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,655
- More than that.
They want to help. Look.

952
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:32,365
- [grunts]

953
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,329
This guy says he saw DeVoe
on 5th and Knoll two days ago.

954
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:39,122
- Yeah, and another guy
on Crescent and 10th.

955
00:41:39,164 --> 00:41:42,417
- This is great.

956
00:41:42,459 --> 00:41:46,587
Iris, this means DeVoe
can't hide from us anymore.

957
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:11,488
- Greg, move your head.
