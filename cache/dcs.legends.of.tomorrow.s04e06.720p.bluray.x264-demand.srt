00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,336
<i>Previously on</i>
Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,396
<i>That's my dad.</i>

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,816
<i>This must be one
of his secret government projects</i>

4
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:06,896
<i>he could never tell me about.</i>

5
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,115
You know, my whole life,

6
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,157
<i>I always believed my power was evil.</i>

7
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,350
Nora Darhk, hands up.

8
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,096
<i>It's time for me to pay
for my past.</i>

9
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,656
<i>I just...
I believe she can be a better person.</i>

10
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,831
<i>- Amaya.
- Itjust looks like her.</i>

11
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,070
<i>She's a shapeshifter.</i>

12
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,816
<i>She's still adjusting
to her new home.</i>

13
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,400
I'm gonna green light
additional funding

14
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,790
<i>to fast track the completion
of your containment facility.</i>

15
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,439
Is that a Kaupe?

16
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,600
I can't believe you guys
have magical creatures here,

17
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,632
this is like the coolest place ever.

18
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,517
Hey, Ava, hope I'm not too early.

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,360
It's Director Sharpe.
You're not early, Mona, you're late.

20
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,035
Oh, no. Are you firing me?
Why does this always happen?

21
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,719
I'm not firing you, Mona.

22
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,918
Awesome, because I cannot wait
to decorate my cubicle.

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,639
There's Rose from <i>Golden Girls.</i>

24
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,792
She's like the OG of girl power.
Am I right?

25
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,917
No. Take that off
and anything else that's metal.

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,096
Leave the toys with these guys.
You do not want to bring anything

27
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,296
into the containment unit
that can be used

28
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,390
as a weapon against you.

29
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,918
But Rose couldn't hurt a fly.

30
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,239
Your job is to feed
our various magical detainees.

31
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,789
Keeping these creatures secure
is the Bureau's newest

32
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,360
and highest priority.

33
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,517
<i>Aloha,</i> Kaupe. Good to see you.

34
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,432
Each cell is encoded
with the captive's genetic signature.

35
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,159
Allowing you to pass them provisions...

36
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,031
all while keeping you safe
from the monsters.

37
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,557
Well, this place
definitely needs decorating.

38
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,476
Now for the Kaupe we're gonna need
a palm tree, some volcanic rock...

39
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,756
This is a prison, Mona, not a home.

40
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,356
Let's go.

41
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,719
And they are our prisoners,
not our friends.

42
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,960
Which is especially true of our most
recent acquisition.

43
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,075
Nora Darhk.

44
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,629
Of all the creatures here,
she's the most despicable.

45
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,230
Hi, I'm Mona.
I'm your magical caretaker.

46
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,552
So if you have
any dietary restrictions

47
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,115
or special requests,
be sure to let me know.

48
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,440
Um...

49
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,840
You should have this.

50
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,594
It just came out.
It's called <i>Uncaged Desire.</i>

51
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,991
Actually, there is something
you can get me, Mona.

52
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,510
Anything, just... You name it.

53
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,520
Some peace...

54
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,629
and quiet. Hmm?

55
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,199
I think you just learned
a very valuable lesson, Mona.

56
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,716
Don't fraternize with the prisoners.

57
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,149
I told you, no interrupt...

58
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,354
Well, you're not Gary.

59
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,510
Perceptive.

60
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,671
And those are not work shoes.

61
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,359
What are you doing here?

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,912
Don't play coy with me.

63
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,389
Happy birthday, Director Sharpe.

64
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,313
Oh, sweet God. Um...

65
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,110
Wow.

66
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,079
You know that I don't normally like
to celebrate my birthday, but...

67
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,198
Well, I am here to fix that,
so close your eyes.

68
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,750
What?

69
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,639
- I said close your eyes.
- Okay. Okay.

70
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,712
Now...

71
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,510
Are you ready
for your birthday present?

72
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,750
Yes.

73
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,636
Are we really doing this?

74
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,758
- Oh!
- Director Sharpe, we need to talk.

75
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,115
Of course, sir, I...

76
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,080
I was just, uh, meditating.
There's this great app that...

77
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,476
Meditate on this.

78
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,910
- Oh, my God!
- Exactly.

79
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,876
These are expenses generated
by the crew of the <i>Waverider.</i>

80
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,475
- The tip of the Time Bureau spear.
- Mmm-hmm.

81
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,233
Your Legends.

82
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,552
You said they were worth
the additional funding.

83
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,991
Let me refer you
to some of my favorite line items.

84
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,113
One hundred and thirty-five million
dollars for a new time core.

85
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,416
What was wrong with the old one?

86
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,671
Oh, well, uh, Rip blew it up

87
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,877
when he sacrificed his life
to save the world.

88
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,631
Sacrifice is right. One point seven
million for historical costumes.

89
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,111
Mmm-hmm. Well, admittedly,
their costumes are flamboyant.

90
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,113
A line item for, and I quote,

91
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,079
"assorted condiments." Assorted?

92
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,470
No one ever accused
the Legends of starving, sir.

93
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,434
If I didn't know any better, I'd say
you were in bed with the Legends.

94
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,518
Either that
or this Captain Sara Lance

95
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,600
is simply screwing you.

96
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,430
Screwing me... Sara Lance?
What are you...

97
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,356
Sir, that is, that is crazy.

98
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,000
Which is exactly what the Pentagon
is going to call me

99
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,754
unless we find a way
to justify these numbers.

100
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,160
Got it, sir.

101
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,679
I know that your team
is worth the money, but I...

102
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,515
I will talk to the team,
see if we can tighten our belts.

103
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,670
Thank you.

104
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,156
I increase their budget

105
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,596
so they can build
magical containment cells

106
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,200
to start capturing these creatures.

107
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,513
Meanwhile, they're running a
nine-figure deficit on a Timeship.

108
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,829
Take a deep breath, Hank.

109
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,336
Hey, if you knew what the Legends did

110
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,496
you'd realize they're, they're
worth every single penny.

111
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,520
Now, how about this?

112
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,876
I'll set up a ride along,
you can meet the gang

113
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,599
and see where I used to live.

114
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,473
I can see where my money is going.

115
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,789
- Sure.
- You're right.

116
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,280
Why don't we go now?

117
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,960
Now?

118
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,296
You know, um, we should
probably give them a chance,

119
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,390
you know, to clean up.

120
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,960
We can't warn them we're coming.
That would defeat the purpose.

121
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,640
Okay. Um, I mean,
I've got to hail the <i>Waverider,</i>

122
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,920
and that's gonna take forever.

123
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,117
Nathaniel, as your boss,

124
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,510
I demand you take me
to the <i>Waverider.</i>

125
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,273
Gonna play the boss card again.

126
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,353
Okay, Dad, sorry, Captain Heywood.

127
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,956
Let's go see what
the Legends are up to.

128
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,680
I can deal with Hank.

129
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,640
And we still have plenty of time to
get things on the ship back in order.

130
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,355
What are they...

131
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,911
- I should probably...
- Go, go, go.

132
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,192
Delivery for...

133
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,596
Damn it!

134
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,950
Sorry!

135
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,114
Wait, don't forget your, uh...

136
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,194
Birthday cake.

137
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,431
Red alert. Nate is on the ship.

138
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,479
<i>And he brought his dad for what's
gotta be a surprise inspection.</i>

139
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,075
We are so not ready
for guests.

140
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,154
Nate's here? I could really use a hug
and get his advice on Nora.

141
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,152
<i>Did you forget
who else is on the ship?</i>

142
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,870
Charlie! You can't let him see her
until we have time to explain

143
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,136
why there's
an Amaya lookalike on board.

144
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,160
<i>Right.</i>

145
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,197
Last time I saw her
she was in the lab.

146
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,236
<i>Everyone keep Nate
away from the lab. I'm on my way.</i>

147
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,517
Any tour of the ship
should start here.

148
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,751
This is where Legends
have team meetings

149
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,117
and hold lively symposiums
of ideas and solutions,

150
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,157
all led by Captain Sara Lance.

151
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,993
And where is this Captain Lance?

152
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,720
Um...

153
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,912
Um, it is a little quiet,
but I assure you Captain Lance is

154
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,390
securing the Legends'
next daring mission.

155
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,480
Next stop,

156
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,512
the parlour,
which we spell with a "U"

157
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,557
because our first captain
was British.

158
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,433
So, why does this ship...

159
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,952
formerly manned by a single person,
now need...

160
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,190
Need a crew of six?

161
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,677
- I can explain. Uh...
- Hey, Ray.

162
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,073
He means five. You mean five.

163
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,400
I mean five. I mean five.
I must have been thinking about

164
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,675
Gideon as a real person.

165
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,559
Are you trying to hurt
my feelings, Dr. Palmer?

166
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,992
Oh, wow, Gideon, hubba hubba.

167
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,713
Love the new look.

168
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,713
Ms. Tomaz gave me,
in her words, a face lift.

169
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,519
This is a talking computer?

170
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,240
Actually, I'm a quantum-enhanced
AI program

171
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,596
capable of operating
completely autonomously...

172
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,720
So, what you're saying is,

173
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,797
you don't need any people
on the ship?

174
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,271
Oh, no, no, no. We do.

175
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,000
Ray, why don't you show Hank
what you do in the...

176
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,400
Not the lab.

177
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,590
Hello, sir.

178
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,992
Uh, you should take him to the library,
it's very impressive

179
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,117
and there are books...

180
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,873
- And bookshelves.
- Bookshelves.

181
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,954
See, Hank, it takes a village.

182
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,190
Follow me.

183
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,869
God.

184
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,554
It was good. It was a good save.

185
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,992
Now, the library is my domain.

186
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,635
I have assembled
quite a collection of...

187
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,438
Nate. It's good to see you,
mate.

188
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,120
You haven't seen the laboratory yet,
have you?

189
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,350
No, why?

190
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,216
Because you should always
save the best for last.

191
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,153
Yeah, you should really put some
clothes on when we have guests.

192
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,592
So, this is your domain?

193
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,953
Why don't we move on. Huh?

194
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,235
Mr. Heywood, welcome aboard.

195
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,198
I see you've already had
the complete tour.

196
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,192
He hasn't seen the lab yet.

197
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,475
That's a great idea.

198
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,835
Wait till you see this.

199
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,351
Hey, so maybe your dad would like
to see the galley.

200
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,272
Or the cargo bay with the crates.

201
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,637
Or the bathroom
is a marvel of efficiency.

202
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,951
Look, you guys need
to pull it together.

203
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,032
Okay, look, I know my dad
sprung this on us,

204
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,680
but we have dealt
with crazier things than...

205
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,675
Amaya?

206
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,480
So this is the ex-girlfriend
you can't shut up about?

207
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,056
Look, I'm sorry,
I should have told you...

208
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,080
She came back.

209
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,958
I knew she'd come back.

210
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,520
You don't understand. It's not...

211
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,000
You look beautiful.

212
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,516
Get your stinking mitts
off of me, you knob!

213
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,550
We should just...

214
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,080
- We're gonna...
- Yeah, just go. Go.

215
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,920
You've changed.

216
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,595
What the hell is going on?

217
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,800
And what's with that accent?
I mean, I dig it, but...

218
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,840
What's going on?

219
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,520
Well, I'm not
your disco-loving ex, mate.

220
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,593
Meet the newest member
of our team.

221
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,990
Charlie.

222
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,800
Charlie here is a shapeshifter.

223
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,476
Except she can no longer shapeshift.
It's actually a pretty crazy...

224
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,034
Let me guess.
She turned into Amaya

225
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,776
and conned you into
not sending her to hell

226
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,936
and Constantine put a spell on her
and now she's stuck like this?

227
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,078
- That is weirdly accurate, yeah.
- Yeah.

228
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,753
I guess it's not such a crazy story.

229
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,069
It's insane, Ray!

230
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,311
I told my dad you guys
were good at your jobs.

231
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,437
And now you're adopting
some magical creature

232
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,874
who's pretending to be Amaya...

233
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,440
Hey, I'm not pretending to be anyone.

234
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,954
That said...

235
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,136
Hank's already looking for ways
to slash our funding,

236
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,949
so maybe it's not the worst idea
to fake it for one mission.

237
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,516
You want me to pretend
to be this wanker's ex?

238
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,437
Sounds like classic
Legends hijinks to me.

239
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,638
We can't let Hank know
that we're harboring a fugitive.

240
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,096
We just need to show him one mission

241
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,200
and send him on his way
before anything can go wrong.

242
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,912
Okay, then maybe
it wasn't the best idea

243
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,719
to leave him with those three.

244
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,754
- We should go.
- Yeah.

245
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,638
All right, team, showtime.

246
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,714
Drinking at work.

247
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,473
Who said anything about work?

248
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,156
Hey, Legends, you hear that?

249
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,754
We got a hit on the magic-ometer.

250
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,036
Oh, where in history are
we gonna end up next?

251
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,595
Where will it be? The wild west?

252
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,195
Medieval China? Or...

253
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,471
Paris in the Roaring Twenties!

254
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,120
- Ooh, la la.
- Gideon, plot a course.

255
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,560
Yes, Captain, right away.

256
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,838
Uh, explain to me how this
magic-ometer of yours works.

257
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,310
- Oh, well...
- Thingy goes beep and we kick ass.

258
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,359
Meaning we investigate
each time period.

259
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,836
- Oh, we find the creature.
- We bring it to the Bureau.

260
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,230
And hopefully learn some
life lessons along the way.

261
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,835
And it takes six of you to do that?

262
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,216
- Seven, if you count Amaya.
- Eight, if you count me.

263
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,357
Sounds a little inefficient.

264
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,794
Which is why we separate
into two very important teams.

265
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:26,193
Z, John, Ray and Amaya
will stay on the ship to quarterback

266
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,556
while the rest of us go in search of

267
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,838
whatever is wreaking havoc
on gay Paree.

268
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,754
I thought that was, uh,
impolitically correct.

269
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,479
Politically incorrect.

270
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,200
Hey, our first mission together.

271
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,960
Don't worry. Anything goes wrong
in the field, I got you covered.

272
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,789
Yeah, well...

273
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,917
I didn't get cold cocked by a girl.

274
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,237
Have you ever been
hit by a girl, Hank?

275
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,155
No, ma'am.

276
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,111
Mmm. We should head out.

277
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,959
Café du Dôme, 1927.
Home to the Lost Generation.

278
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,351
Writers, artists, expats.

279
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,416
- They all...
- All right, so where is this monster?

280
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,750
Yeah, who needs historical context
and wonderment?

281
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,115
I need a drink.

282
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,392
What he means is we need to blend in
with the locals.

283
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,914
This is a recon mission.

284
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,993
Oh, my God, it's him. Salvador Dalí.

285
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,056
What, the creep with the weird mustache?

286
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,356
Don't point.
That's the father of Surrealism.

287
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,989
Look, this is your plan
to catch this creature?

288
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,276
You ask a bunch of
artsy-fartsy fools...

289
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,839
Oh, my God, it's him.

290
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,236
It's Papa.

291
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,870
Papa? What? Your grandfather's here?

292
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,519
Thought he blew up in space.

293
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,519
You are so insensitive.
Not that Papa.

294
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,593
Ernest Hemingway,
he's like my dad's spirit animal.

295
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,672
I say, if we wanna get things done...

296
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,036
we ask the original man of action.

297
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,233
Your dad is totally geeking out
right now.

298
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,791
Mmm-hmm. My entire life my father would
go on and on about Hemingway

299
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,917
and how that was
his idea of a real man.

300
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,912
And that is when I was attacked

301
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,674
by the monstrous man
of the Catacombs.

302
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,955
Well, it's time to talk to
some artsy-fartsy fools.

303
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,551
Uh, you said you saw
a monstrous man? Can you explain?

304
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,359
Of course. Um...

305
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,355
There was a logarithmic curve
to his form...

306
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,674
The drama of his movement
expressing deep personal cosmogony.

307
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,680
Can you draw me a picture?

308
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,554
Okay, let's try one more time.

309
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:51,392
My name is Amaya Jiwe
of the, uh, Justice Society of...

310
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,280
Complete and utter bloody rubbish,
wasn't it?

311
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,840
Yep, it sucks.

312
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,480
Just remember, the Yanks,
they don't say rubbish.

313
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,870
They'd say,
"That was absolute garbage.

314
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,356
"I'm American. Soccer. Yardsticks.

315
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,353
"Ranch dressing. Weasel."

316
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,955
You know what? I quit. Yeah.

317
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,033
I'd rather get some fresh air
than pretend to be this twee old nag.

318
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,157
You can't quit. She can't quit.

319
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,879
Sara needs us to quarterback
the mission.

320
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,350
You don't really think
that's why she left us here, do you?

321
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,319
Uh, she just doesn't want us making
a scene in front of Nate's dad.

322
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,955
Efficiency is the new watchword,
gents.

323
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,351
And while Hank is around,
the three of us...

324
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,635
Four, if you count Charlie.

325
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,439
Five, if you count me.

326
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,113
Are extraneous.

327
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,357
You know, mate, you could just

328
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,913
walk straight off this ship and
no one would even bleeding notice.

329
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,679
Well,
maybe I'll test that theory.

330
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,150
Except I'm not walking.
I'm taking the Jumpship.

331
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,952
The answer is no, Ray.

332
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,838
What? You haven't heard my pitch yet.

333
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,191
You want access to a
secret containment facility

334
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,670
for magical creatures where,
I might add,

335
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,394
there are no conjugal visits.

336
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,636
Wait, what?

337
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,189
You think that I wanna visit Nora
so that we can... We...

338
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,038
I just wanna make sure
that she's okay.

339
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,910
Oh, that is so sweet.

340
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,279
I almost believe that story,
you big, lovable teddy bear, you.

341
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,714
But the answer is still no.

342
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,696
With Nate's dad watching
our each and every move,

343
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,952
there is just no time
for love at the Time Bureau.

344
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,279
There's always time for love.

345
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,797
- Were you eavesdropping?
- Maybe.

346
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,795
Or maybe I was meant
to hear your plight.

347
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,913
Uh, I'm sorry. Who are you again?

348
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,152
Name's Mona, and I know
where they've got Nora locked up.

349
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,789
- You do?
- Mmm-hmm.

350
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,360
And while I can't sneak you in,

351
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,477
I can help you sneak in
the next best thing...

352
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,234
a love letter.

353
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,592
The bull is not the enemy
of the bullfighter.

354
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,594
He is his partner. They are dancers
locked in a dance of death.

355
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,433
Whichever dies, man or bull,

356
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,318
the dance is a thing of beauty.

357
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,400
Hey, we gotta go.

358
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,040
I got a lead on that, uh, thing
we're hunting.

359
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,909
- You're hunters?
- Stay out of this, Hemingway.

360
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,435
Perhaps you'd like to settle
our differences like men.

361
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,360
Oh, I don't have time
for this macho crap, man.

362
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,909
Okay, you two with me.
Rory, keep him busy.

363
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,432
Fine specimen of male vitality.

364
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,513
Fellow pugilist, no doubt.

365
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,875
Author.

366
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,714
Ha! My kind of man. Join me.

367
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,193
Okay, Dalí saw the monster firsthand

368
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,794
when it attacked him
in the Catacombs,

369
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,076
and he drew me this.

370
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,995
- What the hell am I looking at?
- No, no, here.

371
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,160
Yeah, I still don't see it.

372
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,879
All right, ignore the melting clocks.

373
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,429
We got to get this back to the ship
and I have to find a match

374
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,200
to Dalí's drawing
somewhere in the library.

375
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,914
We're supposed to protect history
from the library, Nathaniel?

376
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,636
Okay, I see that
you're really into drinking

377
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,280
the Hemingway Kool-Aid,
and by Kool-Aid I mean scotch,

378
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,319
but we are here to catch a monster.

379
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,995
Of course, but I know we sure as hell

380
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,596
aren't gonna find out what it is
by studying some finger paintings.

381
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,440
We gotta go back to the ship
to figure out what we're doing.

382
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,676
- That's the way we do things, right?
- Yes.

383
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,039
When the mission isn't also
showing Hank a good time.

384
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,555
I'm sorry, but...

385
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,400
You know, I thought this would
be good for the both of us, but...

386
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,315
Hank is at his happiest
when he's telling me

387
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,319
- what I'm doing wrong, so...
- mission accomplished.

388
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,756
Aw, cheer up, bud. You are right,

389
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,833
so Rory and I,
we will keep an eye on Hank,

390
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,513
let him have a few laughs
with Hemingway

391
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,876
while you go figure out
what this thing is.

392
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,520
We bag the creature,
we keep our jobs.

393
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,593
Whoa, where are you all going?

394
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,320
Henry here told me of a creature
hiding in the Catacombs.

395
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,233
Oh, did you, Henry?

396
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,880
- Therefore, we hunt.
- Let's go get our monster.

397
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,037
Nate's right. We have no idea
what this thing is.

398
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,157
A man hunts not to learn
about his prey,

399
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,833
but to learn about himself.

400
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,594
We need to regroup with the team
and get some backup.

401
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,240
What better backup than Hemingway?

402
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,597
I'm finally starting to understand
what it is the Legends do.

403
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,275
Marcel, fetch me my rifles.

404
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,113
Right away, sir.

405
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,719
I need a Marcel.

406
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,680
Yeah, just a little drunk hunting
with Hemingway.

407
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,833
What could go wrong?

408
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,478
Have you ever held a gun before?

409
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,400
Once or twice.

410
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,599
Your friend is much woman.

411
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,149
Have my own.

412
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,760
Signature weapon, I like it.

413
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,200
The drunk painter was right.

414
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,736
The creature is hiding
in the Catacombs.

415
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,830
And it's getting closer.

416
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,957
We need a plan.
We have no idea what this thing is

417
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,117
and if it can even be stopped
with bullets.

418
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,114
I've found that in life the
shortest answer... is doing the thing.

419
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,034
Let's do this thing.

420
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,199
I knew you couldn't resist.

421
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,520
Did you get to the end

422
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,069
where the correctional officer
convinces the judge

423
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,436
to send her to prison,
so he can go free?

424
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,837
Uh, well, I have now.

425
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,158
Sorry, didn't mean to ruin it.

426
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,672
But I brought you an
even a better one.

427
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,675
What the hell is this?

428
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,315
It's a letter from your crush.

429
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,392
Ray left it behind for you.

430
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,837
Don't you see?
Yours is a love no bars can contain.

431
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,240
No, I... I don't want it.

432
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,914
But don't you wanna
at least open it?

433
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Uh, no.

434
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,039
But what if you change your mind,
or your heart?

435
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,080
I'm not gonna change my...
Take the damn letter.

436
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,437
- Look what you made me do!
- Uh-oh.

437
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,160
I'm sorry.

438
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,278
<i>Uh, I swear it's one of these buttons.</i>

439
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,278
What the hell?

440
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,114
Are you okay?

441
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,640
Did she attack you?

442
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,235
It's fine, just...
just a misunderstanding.

443
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,269
What the hell is this?

444
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,269
Where'd you get this?

445
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,194
Did Mona deliver this to you?

446
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,016
Okay, since neither of you
have anything to say,

447
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,599
I'll let the letter speak for itself.

448
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,080
No!

449
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,593
Requesting emergency assistance.

450
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,679
I didn't... I didn't mean to...

451
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,509
We're stuck.

452
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,196
Well, at least
we're all here together, right?

453
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,798
Now I know why
you took my shoelaces.

454
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,720
Lost?

455
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,799
- No, I'm good.
- Uh...

456
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,416
'Cause you're heading
in the wrong direction.

457
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,000
- The <i>Waverider's</i> over there.
- I don't need directions from you.

458
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,273
Listen, sunshine.

459
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,016
I don't know what beef
you had with your ex,

460
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,633
but don't bring it on me.

461
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,873
Zelda, dear, I do believe they're
giving us a run for our money.

462
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,870
You're the Fitzgeralds.

463
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,351
And we pride ourselves the most
quarrelsome couple in Paris.

464
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,512
Don't worry, we're not a couple.

465
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,319
Well, the night is still young.

466
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,800
You should join us for a drink.

467
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:34,391
Besides, no one should be out
on the streets alone tonight.

468
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,240
There is a monster on the loose.

469
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,709
You heard about the monster?

470
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,836
Come with me.

471
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,191
What conversation isn't better
had over a gin rickey?

472
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,320
You hear that?

473
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,278
Dalí's the only one
who's seen the beast.

474
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,480
Take it for what it's worth.

475
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,079
Well, I spoke with him myself.

476
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,273
And according to Dalí,
this is what it looks like.

477
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,434
I can never make heads
or tails of Salvador's work.

478
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,960
That's a minotaur.

479
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,396
A beast, half man, half bull,

480
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,438
spent its whole life lost in a maze?

481
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,239
Oh, now, that's the common myth.

482
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,879
But I heard a different story.

483
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,271
The Minotaur, he's not lost.

484
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,794
He's hiding.

485
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,680
Rejected by his father,

486
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,600
he felt that he had
no place in the real world,

487
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,439
and so he chose to stay in the maze.

488
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,976
If Dalí thinks he's
seen one of these,

489
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,992
I want what he's drinking.

490
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,720
Where are you going?

491
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,360
I am going to figure out a
way to catch a minotaur

492
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,558
and show my father what
a real man of action looks like.

493
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,437
There it is, awaiting the fight.

494
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,159
I got this. Mine's longer.

495
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,990
Fall back!

496
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,753
Wait! I got the shot.

497
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,916
We have to go, now!

498
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,116
I'll never surrender.

499
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,319
But I will strategically retreat.

500
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,474
Get back!

501
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,150
Gideon, Hank's hurt.
Show him what you can do.

502
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,720
- Right away, Captain.
- Dad?

503
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,792
Are you okay?

504
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,736
Please don't blame the Legends,
I should have been there.

505
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,320
Because then you would have
seen me lock eyes with the beast.

506
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,236
And it was in that moment

507
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,789
that I felt a deep
and mutual respect.

508
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,037
- Well, someone's been bonding with Papa.
- Yeah.

509
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,352
Respect that gave way to resolve,
as the beast drew its blade.

510
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,360
The dance had begun.

511
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,716
- Okay. Gideon?
- Initiating scan.

512
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,914
So, CliffNotes.
Big axe, bigger monster.

513
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,800
Knows we're on it.
We need a plan B, quick.

514
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,950
Okay.

515
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,394
Dad, you heal up, we've got this.

516
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,709
No, like hell!

517
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,554
I owe it to him to finish this fight.

518
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,920
Sedative administered.

519
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,719
And you thought a minotaur
was bull-headed?

520
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,792
Ooh, mythology burn.

521
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,594
It's good to have you back.

522
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,696
There has to be a way outta here.

523
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,439
Well, it's a prison cell.

524
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,359
Or an incubator for our
burgeoning friendship.

525
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,279
Isn't breaking out of prison
your thing?

526
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,990
Only reason I escaped last time was
because Ray gave me a time stone.

527
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,352
Tell me everything, because I am
big time shipping you two.

528
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,875
No shipping the inmates.

529
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,200
That's the reason we're
stuck in here in the first place.

530
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,592
I know that getting your
boss locked in a prison

531
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,876
isn't the best way to start a job.

532
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,794
So, if it comes to it,
I'd like you to eat me first.

533
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,480
No one's eating anyone, Mona.

534
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,720
But, when we get out of here,

535
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,077
we do have to talk about your
continued employment at the Bureau.

536
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,830
Wait, no, no, no. You can't fire me.

537
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,434
Give me one good reason why.

538
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,756
Okay, okay.

539
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,956
I was gonna save
this for upstairs but...

540
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,632
Surprise!

541
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,110
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

542
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,760
<i>Happy birthday to...</i>

543
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,957
This isn't making things better,
is it?

544
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,713
No, it's fantastic, keep going.

545
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,830
So that's it.
I finally find a job

546
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,189
where I can use my skills...

547
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,470
Debatable.

548
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:38,073
And I blow it in the first week.

549
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,352
Guess I'm stuck
doing my fallback plan.

550
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,000
Going back to law school.

551
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,600
At least Yale wants me.

552
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,632
Wait! Wait!
That's the "fallback plan"?

553
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,115
Law school?

554
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,998
What are you,
what are you even doing here?

555
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,833
This is my dream job.

556
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,312
It's my mom
who wants me to be a lawyer.

557
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,120
No, you can't give in
to what your parents want.

558
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,159
That's what I did
and look how that ended.

559
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:06,031
Okay, you're not going to
take life advice from Nora Darhk, right?

560
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,976
That's rich.
You should listen to your parents,

561
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
think about your future.

562
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,673
Oh, easy for you to say.

563
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,800
At least you had a future.

564
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,793
When I was a kid, my dad
convinced me to be a demon vessel.

565
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,109
You think it was easy for me?

566
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,520
At least you got to be a kid.

567
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,472
Try being a clone from 2213.

568
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,517
Okay, the only taste
of childhood I ever had

569
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,717
was almost being killed by
a Shtriga at summer camp.

570
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:27,476
Wow. Okay, I need to hear your entire
life stories right now.

571
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,869
- No!
- No!

572
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,360
We might as well get to know
each other if we're stuck here.

573
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,270
Or...

574
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,760
At least have a drink?

575
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,070
What?

576
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,480
We need to bag ourselves a minotaur
before your dad gets himself killed.

577
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,358
Oh, what is that smell?

578
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,896
Did you guys get
a team dog without me?

579
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,360
Because that was my idea.

580
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,110
I bet you guys are having
post-mission pizza parties now, too.

581
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,910
This is the artificial musk
of a female minotaur.

582
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,976
See, minotaurs have
a very sharp sense of smell

583
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,240
when it comes to tracking prey,

584
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,555
but with this little bad boy

585
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,713
I can lure it in by convincing it
that I'm a potential mate.

586
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,917
Then what? You two
gonna ride off together?

587
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,440
Get a nice little flat in Soho?

588
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,592
It's good, but we still need a way to
tame it and get it to the Bureau.

589
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,398
Taming the beast. Taming the beast.
I read about this, I read about this.

590
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,634
Um, let's see, the
<i>Magical Treatise of Solomon.</i>

591
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,235
Here we go.

592
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,039
"To ease the Minotaur's rage

593
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:25,352
"his mother would play him
a lullaby on a lute built by..."

594
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,234
- "Daedalus."
- That's it.

595
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,956
We'll lure it out
and lull it to sleep.

596
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,316
No one gets hurt,
not even the minotaur.

597
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,313
And then we'll have a pizza party.

598
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,640
And that's when I found out
I was from the future.

599
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,235
- Oh, the future?
- Yep.

600
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,595
It was all fake.

601
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,389
My parents, my memories.

602
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,675
Growing up in Fresno.

603
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,336
It's still better than
spending your childhood

604
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,033
with the Order of
the Shrouded Compass.

605
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,751
Is that like
<i>The Sisterhood of Traveling Pants?</i>

606
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,112
Even worse, death cult.

607
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,353
And before that, I just

608
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,274
moved around from one
mental institution to the next.

609
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,551
Point is, you're lucky.

610
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,956
I'm lucky?

611
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,997
I just wish my past was made up.

612
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,656
What, so you can
wake up one day and realize

613
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,797
that you don't have
any family, friends,

614
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,792
or life experiences to hold on to?

615
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,078
Doesn't sound that different
from waking up in a prison cell.

616
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,875
Touché.

617
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,039
Are you two kidding me right now?

618
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,313
Ava, you're a clone from the future.

619
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,753
And you run the Time Travel Bureau.

620
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,914
And you're a witch.

621
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,439
And you escaped a cult.

622
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,793
- And a real-life demon.
- I did.

623
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:42,439
You two are like the two
coolest women I have ever met.

624
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,599
And I once met Gillian Anderson

625
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,991
at an <i>X-Files</i> meet and greet.

626
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,398
Wow. Mona, you are a gem.

627
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,872
You know, we can't have a birthday
without birthday cake.

628
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,320
Yeah.

629
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,797
Back on your feet already, Hank?

630
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,030
Your gal patched me up good,

631
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,634
I'm just running
through our strategy.

632
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,871
Oh, wait, did you let him use our
D&D miniatures?

633
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,350
No, I didn't let him touch Sindra,
Lord of the Dark Elves.

634
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,153
You guys D&D without me too?

635
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,830
Son, why are
you holding a tiny guitar?

636
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,479
Or do I even wanna know?

637
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,758
- Uh, this, this is a lute.
- Someone say, "loot"?

638
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,816
This is what we're gonna use to
put the minotaur to sleep.

639
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,896
- I thought you said that was "loot."
- I don't understand.

640
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,718
Well, I suppose it is more of a lyre.

641
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,990
Everyone's a liar.

642
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,056
This is how we're going
to catch our creature, Dad.

643
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,434
- That's your plan?
- Yeah.

644
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,920
We're facing a literal monster.

645
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,997
You think you
can destroy it with a lute?

646
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,874
Well, in the hands of a master,
a lute is a formidable weapon.

647
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,030
Just look at Sting, mate.

648
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,376
Sorry to interrupt,
but there's a change in the timeline.

649
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,357
An attack at
Café du Dôme is imminent.

650
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,709
There will be no survivors.

651
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,235
The minotaur must be tracking
Hemingway's scent.

652
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,510
Let's move out.

653
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,992
Uh, Nathaniel, get out of my way.

654
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,536
I don't have to do
what you say anymore, Hank.

655
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,631
Really? Because as your superior,

656
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,552
I'm telling you to stand down.

657
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,956
There goes the "superior"
thing again, you know?

658
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,361
You don't wanna listen to me
or understand me, you just...

659
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,557
You just wanna be better than me.

660
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,237
Well, you're one to
talk about listening,

661
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,835
you've ignored every lesson
I've ever tried to teach you.

662
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,754
Because it's the same lesson
over and over again.

663
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,997
You want me to
be more like you, Hank.

664
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,231
But guess what? I'm not like you.

665
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,073
I don't like televised golf

666
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:18,073
or Tom Clancy books
or '70s folk rock.

667
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,031
I don't know if you happened to
notice but I'm a grown-ass superhero.

668
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:28,154
Who's just trying to
play the lute for a minotaur.

669
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,435
Fine.

670
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,190
Don't listen to your old man.
Maybe you'll listen to your captain.

671
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,910
I'm sorry, but I'm with Nate.

672
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,155
I know his idea sounds crazy,
but he's right.

673
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,519
And that's what makes him a Legend.

674
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,394
No matter where he is.

675
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,154
Look, you said you wanted
to see a Legends mission.

676
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,754
Well, you're about to.

677
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,276
And if it goes wrong, well...

678
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,080
You go ahead and fire all of us.

679
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,357
The beast advanced.

680
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,669
I turned on him,

681
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,114
gun raised.

682
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,914
Seeing we'd reached an agreement,

683
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,395
I fired!

684
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,880
So I don't think we'll be seeing
that creature anytime soon.

685
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,309
Yeah? Then what is that?

686
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,073
Back for another go, are you?

687
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,634
Oye, fuzzball, come on.

688
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,519
Have a nice little
whiff of this, will ya?

689
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,991
- All right, that's your cue.
- Okay.

690
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,836
I haven't had
much time to rehearse, but...

691
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,031
- Now, we end this.
- No!

692
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,753
I warn you, I will strike a woman.

693
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,000
That's for being on my
summer eighth grade reading list.

694
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,074
Uh, guys?

695
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,040
Nathaniel!

696
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,997
Always preferred Faulkner.

697
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,800
So, not a bad birthday, huh?

698
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,874
Considering my original plan was
a <i>House Hunters</i> marathon?

699
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,839
That actually sounds pretty great.

700
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,433
You know what?

701
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,195
You should have this.

702
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,517
You know you wanna read it.

703
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,836
Look.

704
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,112
I learned from being
locked up that the

705
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,954
only way to survive is to shut down.

706
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:46,836
If you don't have a future,
it's best not to look forward.

707
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:51,636
Not to meals, or birthdays...

708
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,553
or relationships.

709
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,016
Just because this is your present,

710
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,633
doesn't mean it
has to be your future.

711
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,996
Who knows, maybe some day you can

712
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,037
get outta here
without having to escape.

713
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,270
Yeah.

714
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,359
And aren't you glad
you didn't shut down today?

715
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,639
Well, this cake is pretty good.

716
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,359
Come on! Come on!

717
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,000
Who doesn't wanna see
a Ray Palmer love letter?

718
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,120
You have to open it,
there's probably glitter in it.

719
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,913
- I wanna know.
- Go on.

720
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,316
- Open it. Open it.
- Open it. Open it.

721
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,880
You know what?

722
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:28,030
- Come on.
- No...

723
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,600
Oh, hi there.

724
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,830
- Ray?
- Ray?

725
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,957
Yeah, hi. Uh, could I get some help?

726
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,554
Uh, I'm a little stuck.

727
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,479
- Get behind the bar.
- Good idea.

728
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,794
I meant for cover.

729
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,554
Well, I like your version.

730
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,160
See? He looks just as I drew it.

731
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,039
You leave that weirdo alone!

732
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,679
Your fight is with me.

733
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,354
Come on.

734
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,318
Now, the dance begins.

735
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,896
I needed to make sure she was okay.

736
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,991
I wanted to make sure you were okay.

737
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,117
Uh, actually, I just really
wanted to see her.

738
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,516
And then I thought I'd
deliver the message myself.

739
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,353
But then I got stuck in the glue.

740
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,510
That was sweet.

741
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,111
Stupid, but sweet.

742
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,197
No, it's unacceptable.

743
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,113
But in this case...

744
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,830
Clearly convenient.

745
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,555
So, since you are so
good at getting people out of prison...

746
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,798
let's get the hell outta here,
shall we?

747
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,833
Oh. Yeah. Yeah.

748
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,878
Let's just hope the team
wasn't missing the QB.

749
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,390
That's my boy!

750
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,670
Over here!

751
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:13,634
<i>There is a young cowboy
that lives on the range</i>

752
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:19,516
<i>His horse and his cattle
are his only companions</i>

753
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,875
<i>He works in the saddle
and he sleeps in the canyons</i>

754
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:30,034
<i>Waiting for summer
His pastures to change</i>

755
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,873
What is happening?

756
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,071
James Taylor, and it's good.

757
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:39,236
<i>And as the moon rises
he sits by his fire</i>

758
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:43,758
<i>Thinking about women
and glasses of beer</i>

759
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,951
<i>And closing his eyes
as the dogies retire</i>

760
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:53,876
<i>He sings out a song
which is soft but it's clear</i>

761
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:57,920
<i>As if maybe someone could hear</i>

762
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,634
You got this, Dad.

763
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:05,991
<i>Goodnight, you moonlight ladies</i>

764
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:11,075
<i>Rockabye, sweet baby James</i>

765
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:15,473
<i>Deep greens and blues
are the colors I choose</i>

766
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:20,396
<i>Won't you let me go down in my dreams</i>

767
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,997
<i>And rockabye, sweet baby James</i>

768
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,878
Now, that is how you finish
a Legends mission.

769
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,240
You did good, son.

770
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,437
Well, right back at you, Dad.

771
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,873
I learned it from you, Nathaniel.

772
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,078
<i>Hola,</i> Juni.

773
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,631
<i>Privyet,</i> Baba Yaga.

774
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,159
What's up, Nora?

775
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,232
I thought you were headed to Yale.

776
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,960
After last night, I marched home
and told my parents

777
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,520
I didn't wanna be a lawyer.

778
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,591
And also that I was craving nachos
and wanted to do karaoke.

779
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,195
The rosé had really
kicked in at that point.

780
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,398
Oh, and here, my mom's homemade congee.

781
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,153
Great hangover cure.

782
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,637
Hey, can you do me a favor?

783
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,959
I wrote...

784
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,391
I wrote Ray a letter. Uh...

785
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:34,279
Uh, yeah, it'd be an honor
to deliver it.

786
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,510
Yeah.

787
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,399
Anything for my
generation's Ross and Rachel.

788
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,109
Uh, morning, Director Sharpe.

789
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,554
A word, Mona.

790
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,355
What?

791
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,911
Wait, are you firing me this time?

792
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,400
No, Mona.

793
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,240
After yesterday, I realized...

794
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,760
There is some room for
a little humanity in this place.

795
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,997
<i>Aloha,</i> Kaupe.

796
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,197
Permission to scratch his tummy?

797
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,229
Permission granted.

798
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,599
And you should deliver that letter.

799
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,630
Well.

800
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,880
That was a chaotic, reckless,
wasteful mess.

801
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,278
I think I finally see
the value in the Legends.

802
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,120
Yeah. You could have
led with that last part.

803
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,480
We're glad to have you on board.

804
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,797
Well, this has been fun.

805
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,838
But it's time for me to get back.

806
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,400
Yeah, you know what? Um...

807
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,078
I'll meet you back there,
Dad.

808
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,072
He's right, this was fun.

809
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,790
It's good to be back.

810
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,190
Well, the door is always open.

811
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:56,216
You know, coming back here, I thought
it'd be like the old days.

812
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,913
But, I don't know
what's more surprising,

813
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,077
the fact that so much has changed,

814
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,916
or at some point
this became the old days.

815
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,598
You'd think we of all people would
understand that time makes no sense.

816
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,399
- Yeah.
- But...

817
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,478
I guess it's something
you never accept.

818
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,993
You know I love you guys, right?

819
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,600
But, uh...

820
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,274
I belong over there.

821
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,999
I get it.

822
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,829
I'm proud of you.

823
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,671
Now, go on. Go do your adult thing.

824
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,160
And we'll see you around.

825
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,356
Okay.

826
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,234
Though...

827
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,920
If you're not in a rush?

828
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,296
- It's a pizza party.
- Yeah.

829
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,232
Yeah. Here he is!

830
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,199
- Everybody!
- Hey, welcome back, ugly.

831
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,430
Yes, what other bright ideas

832
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,955
are you gonna leave us with
before you bugger off?

833
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,516
Softball team.

834
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,193
Oh, no, only electronic sports.

835
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,316
Piñata Fridays.

836
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,472
How many times
do I have to say no to that?

837
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,349
Unionizing.

838
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,716
Ooh! Don't let Hank hear you say that.

839
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,037
You know, it's still weird
not having you around.

840
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,752
Oh, man, I'll always
be right there, big guy,

841
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,280
- in that giant heart of yours.
- Aw.

842
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,759
And I'll be at the Bureau.

843
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,880
So you guys can literally
stop by whenever you want.

844
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:14,037
But you know,
before I go, I do wanna say one thing.

845
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,352
When I first stepped onto this ship,

846
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,716
I was, you know,
trying to get away from

847
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:22,072
all my baggage back home and,
I can't believe I'm gonna say this...

848
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,313
Hemingway once wrote,

849
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,030
"You can't get away from yourself
by moving from one place to another."

850
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,631
And thanks to you guys,
I don't have to run anymore.

851
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,720
Being here with you all

852
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,376
has turned me into
the man I need to be.

853
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,199
And, uh, this place is special.

854
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:40,679
And you never know
when it's gonna be over, so...

855
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,351
I say, Legends,
enjoy the ride while it lasts.

856
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,597
- Hear! Hear! Cheers.
- Cheers.

857
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,758
- Cheers.
- Cheers. Cheers.

858
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,479
Uh, you'll find your place here.

859
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,915
I know I did.
