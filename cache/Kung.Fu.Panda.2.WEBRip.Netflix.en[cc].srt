00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:32,755
{\an1}when you have inner peace.

510
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,259
[cheering]

511
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,721
{\an1}Inner peace. Inner peace.

512
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,721
{\an1}Inner peace.

513
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:42,890
[exhales] Peace on.

514
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:44,767
- [Ping] Oh, Po?

515
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:44,767
- Peace!

516
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:47,145
Oh, Po, I got you

517
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:47,145
a travel pack.

518
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:50,773
{\an1}I packed you food for weeks.

519
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:50,773
{\an1}Cookies, buns, vegetables.

520
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,860
I even packed all your

521
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,860
action figures. See?

522
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:55,528
[guffaws]

523
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:58,489
{\an1}Oh, uh... Hey,

524
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:58,489
{\an1}I don't know what those are.

525
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,366
Never seen them before

526
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,366
in my life.

527
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:02,493
Dad, you got scratches

528
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:02,493
on my Tigress.

529
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:05,579
I also packed your paintings

530
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:05,579
of our best time together,

531
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,957
just in case you get lonely.

532
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:09,917
That's me and you

533
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:09,917
making noodles.

534
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:12,003
And that's me and you

535
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:12,003
eating noodles.

536
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:15,631
And that's me giving

537
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:15,631
you a piggyback ride.

538
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:19,468
{\an5}Isn't that cute?

539
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:19,468
On second thought,

540
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:19,468
I'll hang on to this one.

541
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,428
{\an1}Hey, uh...

542
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,428
{\an1}they're waiting for me.

543
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:25,058
Of course, of course.

544
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:25,058
You have a job to do...

545
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:26,934
...far from home,

546
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,187
in a strange city,

547
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,187
filled with strange people,

548
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,437
and strange noodles,

549
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:31,814
facing horrible danger

550
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:34,274
from which you

551
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:34,274
might never return!

552
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,651
Don't go, Po.

553
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,196
{\an1}I gotta go.

554
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,196
{\an1}I'm the Dragon Warrior.

555
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,656
{\an1}It's kind of my job

556
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,656
{\an1}to save kung fu.

557
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,743
{\an1}And if I don't...

558
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,743
{\an1}what am I?

559
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:46,162
You're my son.

560
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:50,124
Right?

561
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,628
{\an1}- [Tigress] Po, it's time.

562
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,628
{\an1}- Um, goodbye.

563
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,298
Don't worry, Mr. Ping.

564
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:00,885
{\an1}He'll be back

565
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:00,885
{\an1}before you can say "noodles".

566
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,559
Noodles.

567
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:16,525
Come on, guys, let's go!

568
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,194
Yeah!

569
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:22,322
[panting and groaning]

570
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,117
Yeah, yeah.

571
00:21:24,242 --> 00:21:25,534
Yeah...

572
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:40,382
[Po] Oh!

[sighs]

[chuckles]

579
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,573
Mama?

580
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:53,247
Mom? Dad?

581
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:54,456
Is that you?

582
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:57,126
Mom! Dad!

583
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,172
Oh, hi. Hey, son.

584
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,172
You're back.

585
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:02,673
{\an1}Huh?

586
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,675
{\an1}Honey, what are you

587
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,675
{\an1}doing here?

588
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,177
But I thought...

589
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:09,138
{\an1}We've replaced you, dear,

590
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:09,138
{\an1}with this lovely radish.

591
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,182
{\an1}Radish?

592
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:13,226
It's quiet, polite,

593
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:13,226
and frankly,

594
00:23:13,351 --> 00:23:15,019
does better kung fu.

595
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:17,771
- [squeaks]

596
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:17,771
- No. No, no, no.

00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:23,861
Wait! [grunting]

Inner peace.

{\an1}Oh. Uh, I'm, uh, training.

618
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:31,220
The mast is not

619
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:31,220
a worthy opponent.

620
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,143
- I am ready.

621
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,143
- OK.

622
00:24:37,268 --> 00:24:39,437
{\an1}So serious.

{\an1}- I think I prefer the mast.

00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:49,447
{\an1}- Apologies.

627
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:53,951
{\an1}I used to punch the ironwood

628
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:53,951
{\an1}trees by the palace to train.

629
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:55,619
Now I feel nothing.

00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:58,622
That's severely cool.

{\an1}how long did you

00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:09,549
{\an1}have to do that?

637
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:13,053
{\an5}- Twenty years.

00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:13,053
- Oh. Twenty...

639
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:13,053
Twenty years? [groans]

{\an1}Is there any, uh,

{\an1}you know, faster way?

642
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:18,225
{\an1}You know, until you, uh,

643
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:18,225
{\an1}you know... don't feel anything?

644
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:19,352
No.

645
00:25:19,477 --> 00:25:21,812
- Besides...

- [shouts]

647
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,651
I don't think hard style

648
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,651
is your thing.

649
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:29,820
Oh.

650
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:34,783
Po, why are you

651
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:34,783
really out here?

652
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:39,497
{\an1}I just found out that my dad...

653
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:39,497
{\an1}isn't really my dad.

654

Your dad? The goose.

655
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:48,088
That must have been

656
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:48,088
quite a shock.

657
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:50,174
Yeah.

00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:53,093
- And this bothers you?

00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:53,093
- Are you kidding me?

660
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:56,222
We're warriors, right?

So hardcore you

665
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,852
don't feel anything.

{\an1}[chuckles] Yeargh!

00:26:03,354 --> 00:26:06,273
{\an1}Yo. Wow.

you guys talking about?

Nothing. Nothing.

I'm so lucky. I don't have

any problems with my dad.

675
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:19,328
Maybe it's because Mom ate

676
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:19,328
his head before I was born.

677
00:26:19,453 --> 00:26:22,331
{\an1}- I don't know.

678
00:26:19,453 --> 00:26:22,331
{\an1}- Mantis, this isn't about you.

679
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:24,542

Oh, good! You found it.

Come on, you guys! Yeah!

Guys, are we going or not?

932

Do you want to

meet us there later?

934
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,600
You do want to take

935
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,600
back your city, right?

936
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:03,435
Of course we do.

937
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,978
But if we stand up to Shen,

938
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,397
{\an1}he will turn the weapon

939
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,397
{\an1}on the city.

940
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:10,859
{\an4}Listen to yourself.

941
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:10,859
{\an1}You're protecting Gongmen City

{\an1}by not protecting Gongmen City?

943
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:16,073
{\an4}- If we all fight together...

944
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:16,073
{\an1}- Then the weapon would kill

945
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:16,073
{\an1}everyone.

946
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:19,659
{\an1}Oh, would it?

947
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:19,659
{\an1}Then we use... a sneak attack!

948
00:35:19,785 --> 00:35:22,996
{\an4}- We get inside and then...

949
00:35:19,785 --> 00:35:22,996
{\an1}- And then you will be

950
00:35:19,785 --> 00:35:22,996

{\an1}...by the unstoppable weapon.

00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:29,920
Nothing's unstoppable

00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:29,920

1185
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:06,436
{\an1}- Nothing else?

1186
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:09,772
{\an4}You probably did some other

1187
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:09,772
{\an1}evil stuff along the way,

1188
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:09,772
{\an1}I don't know.

1189
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:11,524
- What else did you do?

1190
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:11,524
- You don't know?

1191
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,234
- Know what?

1192
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,234
- [laughter]

1193
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,611
{\an1}What's so funny?

1194
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:17,614
The very thing that

1195
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:17,614
you clearly do not know!

1196
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:21,700
{\an1}OK, enough of these riddles!

1197
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:21,700
{\an1}Would you guys spill the beans?

1198
00:44:21,826 --> 00:44:25,204
{\an1}First we come in and the weapon

1199
00:44:21,826 --> 00:44:25,204
{\an1}is tiny. Surprise, it's big.

1200
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:27,748
{\an1}Then the lady over here,

1201
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:27,748
{\an1}I think it's a guy.

1202
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:29,292
'Cause he's got... Whoa!

1203
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:32,378
The only reason

1204
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:32,378
you are still alive

1205
00:44:32,504 --> 00:44:37,216
{\an1}is that I find your stupidity

1206
00:44:32,504 --> 00:44:37,216
{\an1}mildly amusing.

1207
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:40,761
{\an1}Well, thank you. But I find your

1208
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:40,761
{\an1}evilness extremely annoying.

1209
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:42,805
{\an1}Who do you think you are, panda?

1210
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,433
{\an1}Who do you think I am, peacock?

1211
00:44:45,558 --> 00:44:48,019
[both laugh]

1212
00:44:54,317 --> 00:44:57,153
Why are we laughing?

1213
00:44:54,317 --> 00:44:57,153
[sighs]

1214
00:44:57,278 --> 00:44:58,779
Take aim.

1215
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:12,751
Fire. [laughs]

1216
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:15,672
Huh?

1217
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:18,591
Well, light the thing!

1218
00:45:18,715 --> 00:45:20,926
I did!

1219
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:27,266
Fear the bug!

1220
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:31,437
Ha-ha!

1221
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:37,652
[Po] Get the weapon!

1222
00:45:39,529 --> 00:45:41,698
Tigress!

1223
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:51,374
[screams]

1224
00:45:54,544 --> 00:45:56,921
[continues screaming]

1225
00:45:58,381 --> 00:46:00,049
[cheering]

1226
00:46:05,054 --> 00:46:07,223
[crying]

1227
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:15,690
You... you were there.

1228
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:18,901
Yes. Yes, I was.

1229
00:46:26,743 --> 00:46:27,993
{\an1}You just let Shen get away!

1230
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,912
At least we destroyed

1231
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,912
the weapon.

1232
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,419
Fire!

1233
00:46:38,588 --> 00:46:40,757
{\an1}Oh, no, he's got way more.

1234
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:44,176
Aargh, aargh!

1235
00:46:46,638 --> 00:46:48,805
- My wing!

1236
00:46:46,638 --> 00:46:48,805
- Help, Po!

1237
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:50,349
Coming! Aaargh!

1238
00:46:50,475 --> 00:46:52,602
- Watch out!

1239
00:46:50,475 --> 00:46:52,602
- Po!

1240
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:56,063
Whoa. Wow!

1241
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:59,358
- Help me up!

1242
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:59,358
- No. Get him down.

1243
00:46:59,484 --> 00:47:01,235
Use the ropes.

1244
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:06,115
Waaargh!

1245
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:12,204
Run, run, little panda!

1246
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:16,125
Whoa! [screams]

1247
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,543
[screeches]

1248
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:23,132
[panting]

1249
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:25,217
{\an1}Po, come on.

1250
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:25,217
{\an1}We need you to focus!

1251
00:47:25,343 --> 00:47:28,304
- I got it, I got it!

1252
00:47:25,343 --> 00:47:28,304
- Bring it down!

1253
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,810
- We're trapped!

1254
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,810
- This way!

1255
00:47:34,477 --> 00:47:36,562
[rumbling]

1256
00:47:36,688 --> 00:47:39,982
[laughing] Goodbye!

1257
00:47:40,692 --> 00:47:42,067
Yah!

1258
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:44,320
Fire!

1259
00:47:45,488 --> 00:47:47,824
Get back!

1260
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:50,159
Hah! Hah!

1261
00:47:54,747 --> 00:47:57,709
{\an1}- The only way out is up.

1262
00:47:54,747 --> 00:47:57,709
{\an1}- Aaargh!

1263
00:47:57,834 --> 00:48:00,044
[all] What? [screaming]

1264
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:08,093
Yee-hah!

1265
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:10,221
Whoo-hoo!

1266
00:48:10,346 --> 00:48:13,599
Follow me! Come on!

1267
00:48:13,725 --> 00:48:15,601
- Where are they going?

1268
00:48:13,725 --> 00:48:15,601
- To the top!

1269
00:48:15,727 --> 00:48:18,103
Come on! Keep going!

1270
00:48:24,861 --> 00:48:26,612
Here we go!

1271
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:32,368
Whoa-aahh!

1272
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:46,465
You idiot!

1273
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:48,467
Ow! My nose!

1274
00:48:48,593 --> 00:48:52,680
{\an1}Call in the wolves! All of them.

1275
00:48:48,593 --> 00:48:52,680
{\an1}I want them ready to move!

1276
00:48:52,805 --> 00:48:56,768
The Year of the Peacock

1277
00:48:52,805 --> 00:48:56,768
begins now!

1278
00:48:56,893 --> 00:48:58,185
Right now?

1279
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,479
'Cause it's the middle

1280
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,479
of the year,

1281
00:49:00,605 --> 00:49:04,191
{\an5}so you'd only get,

1282
00:49:00,605 --> 00:49:04,191
like, a half of the

1283
00:49:00,605 --> 00:49:04,191
Year of the Peacock.

1284
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:08,195
And this is the Year,

1285
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:08,195
of course, of the Peacock.

1286
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,988
Happy New Year, sir.

1287
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:17,830
{\an1}Get the wolves ready.

1288
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:17,830
{\an1}We're loading the ships now.

1289
00:49:17,954 --> 00:49:19,081
Now!

1290
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:21,250
Now, now, now, now!

1291
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:24,378
{\an1}Move! Move, move, move, move!

1292
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:33,053
[howls]

1293
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:42,772
[Tigress] This way.

1294
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:48,611
- [howling]

1295
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:48,611
- Let's go.

1296
00:49:50,655 --> 00:49:53,282
[grunting]

1297
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:57,161
{\an1}Oh, you! What did you do?

1298
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:57,161
{\an1}It's chaos up there.

1299
00:49:57,286 --> 00:49:59,121
{\an1}What happened to stopping Shen?

1300
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:03,334
Yeah.

1301
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:05,377
Guys, come on.

1302
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:05,377
Give me a little credit.

1303
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:08,380
{\an1}I meant for him to get away

1304
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:08,380
{\an1}because, uh...

1305
00:50:08,506 --> 00:50:10,967
...it was a trick.

1306
00:50:08,506 --> 00:50:10,967
It was a plot.

1307
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:16,848
{\an1}I was thinking...

1308
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:16,848
{\an1}I'll figure out his plot more.

1309
00:50:16,973 --> 00:50:18,516
{\an1}That makes no sense.

1310
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:21,894
{\an5}- What do you mean?

1311
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:21,894
Sure it does.

1312
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:21,894
- Po, the truth.

1313
00:50:22,018 --> 00:50:24,647
{\an1}- You had Shen. What happened?

1314
00:50:22,018 --> 00:50:24,647
{\an1}- What are you talking about?

1315
00:50:24,772 --> 00:50:27,650
{\an1}I don't know what you're talking

1316
00:50:24,772 --> 00:50:27,650
{\an1}about. I... Yeah...

1317
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:29,318
OK, he caught me off guard.

1318
00:50:29,986 --> 00:50:32,154
{\an1}The truth.

1319
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:37,910
{\an1}Fine. They will keep you

1320
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:37,910
{\an1}far from danger.

1321
00:50:38,034 --> 00:50:40,913
- Real far.

1322
00:50:38,034 --> 00:50:40,913
- What?

1323
00:50:41,037 --> 00:50:43,039
{\an1}You're staying here.

1324
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:45,167
W... Wait!

1325
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:47,294
I have to go ba...

1326
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:53,009
{\an1}You're staying here!

1327
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:56,178
I'm going.

1328
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:56,178
And you can't stop me.

1329
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:59,181
Whoa!

1330
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:01,600
{\an1}OK. I wasn't ready that time.

1331
00:51:01,726 --> 00:51:03,435
{\an1}Guys? Don't.

1332
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:05,145
Ready.

1333
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:06,522
Look!

1334
00:51:07,523 --> 00:51:09,525
[screams]

1335
00:51:12,695 --> 00:51:15,155
- Aaaah!

1336
00:51:12,695 --> 00:51:15,155
- [thudding]

1337
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:20,452
{\an1}Stay down.

1338
00:51:21,871 --> 00:51:24,665
- I have to get to him.

1339
00:51:21,871 --> 00:51:24,665
- Then tell me why!

1340
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:29,628
He was there! OK?

1341
00:51:29,754 --> 00:51:33,089
{\an1}The peacock was there

1342
00:51:29,754 --> 00:51:33,089
{\an1}the last time I saw my parents.

1343
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:36,761
He knows what happened.

1344
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:36,761
Where I came from.

1345
00:51:36,886 --> 00:51:39,680
Who I am.

1346
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:45,811
Look, I'm going.

1347
00:51:45,937 --> 00:51:48,230
I have to know.

1348
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:51,483
{\an1}- The hardcore can't understand.

1349
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:51,483
{\an1}- Tigress, no!

1350
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:58,657
The hardcore do understand.
