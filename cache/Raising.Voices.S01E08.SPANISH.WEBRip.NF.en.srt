<i>Don't go to school.</i>

00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,120
You're in time to avoid a real fuckup.

6
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,360
Besides, school's out in a week,
and it'll be forgotten.

7
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,800
Half of them didn't even know.

8
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,880
Soon it won't matter.

9
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,520
And most people will forget
your name and your face.

10
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,840
Alma, stay at home.

11
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,760
Don't do it.

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,840
This isn't working.

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,760
MONDAY

22
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,280
It works perfectly fine.

23
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,520
-This is wild.
-I don't believe it.

24
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,480
-Give me a marker.
-What for?

25
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,720
-Give it here.
-Here.

26
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,280
-Look.
-Like this?

27
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,160
-You're going too far.
-No, look...

28
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,480
-That's it.
-Let's go.

29
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,480
Let's go.

30
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,760
{\an8}HI, I'M ALMA
AND I LIKE TO SUCK DICK.

31
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,080
Alma, don't you know
plastic is bad for the planet?

32
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,280
Natural is better.

33
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,320
Everyone saw him feeling himself up.

34
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,600
-He says it's a joke, a reality TV thing.
-That's a lie.

35
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,880
I'm not so sure either.

36
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,960
See? I don't have to put up with this shit
just because I'm a girl.

37
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,840
-Don't exaggerate.
-I'm not!

38
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,080
You don't get it.

39
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,360
I do get it, Alma.

40
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,080
I won't allow this sort of conduct,
but I can't justify an assault.

41
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,000
What?

42
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,920
<i>Read carefully before you begin.</i>

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You have 45 minutes.

44
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,520
Sorry for interrupting.
I've come for my things.

45
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,440
Is something wrong?

46
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,520
Three-day expulsion.

47
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,360
How are you?

48
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,560
How do you think?

49
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,800
A three-day expulsion
because of that jerk.

50
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,560
Fuck, what a bummer.

51
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,320
I don't know what's going on.
Can you tell me?

52
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,080
You clearly pissed someone off.

53
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,480
Look at this.

54
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,800
Fuck.

55
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,600
How did they get these photos?

56
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,600
-Did they hack my phone or what?
-No.

57
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,800
It's easier than that.
Who took that photo?

58
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,760
Nata.

59
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,320
PutoAlfucking is Alberto's username.

60
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,880
Now you know.

61
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,400
Fuck!

62
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,400
Son of a bitch.

63
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,640
Hello, bitch.

64
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,560
I know you sent the photos to Alberto.

65
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,400
You're a fucking bitch, you know?

66
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,200
What a way to end
12 years of fucking friendship.

67
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,880
<i>I'm never speaking to you again.</i>

68
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,680
<i>But here's a farewell gift, okay?</i>

69
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,160
<i>Your guy's dick,
in case you don't recognize it again.</i>

70
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,960
Can you tell me what the fuck this is?

71
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,880
She was provoked.

72
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,920
I admit that boy behaved inappropriately,
but Alma's reaction was disproportionate.

73
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,440
Maybe a sex education class
would prevent this inappropriate behavior?

74
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,120
We'll discuss it
at the next school board meeting,

75
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,000
as well as
Alma's constant disruptive behavior.

76
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,920
Asshole.

77
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,320
{\an8}THURSDAY

78
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,440
I'll see you in my office after school.

79
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,640
Okay?

80
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,680
Okay.

81
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,640
All right?

82
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,240
Okay. So when calculating,

83
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,920
it's important we make sure to include

84
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,280
all the foreseeable
ordinary and extraordinary expenses.

85
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,440
This way, we can manage
the resulting amount...

86
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,000
Always look me in the eye.

87
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,480
Come in.

88
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,960
Will you tell me what happened?

89
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,720
That jerk felt himself up in my face,
so I kicked him.

90
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,920
It was no big deal. He played the victim.

91
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,800
Do you have a problem with that boy?

92
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,040
No, apart from him being a jerk.
I barely know him.

93
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,040
Goddammit.

94
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,600
You reacted very violently.

95
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,480
I'm sick of them picking on me.

96
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,440
There's graffiti in the bathroom.
They call me "slut."

97
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,760
Besides, I'm getting expelled for good.

98
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,720
The principal spoke to my parents,

99
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,160
and all the effort I put in
won't be worth shit.

100
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,520
No.

101
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,280
That won't happen,

102
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,640
because I'm on the board,

103
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,720
and I'd never allow it.

104
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,960
Do you trust me?

105
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,240
So why not tell me the truth?

106
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,040
The other day,
I caught a student sharing photos.

107
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,320
Photos...

108
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,600
in which you appeared.

109
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,000
You know what I mean, right?

110
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,120
Why?

111
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,320
Why did you take them?

112
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,520
It was one day with my friend.
We were fooling around.

113
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,440
Right.

114
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,720
Do you have more photos like that?

115
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,320
Yes.

116
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,720
Delete them.

117
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,360
All of them.

118
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,920
Want one?

119
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,240
I mean,

120
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,560
what are you trying to do?

121
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,240
Is this a new way to score, or...

122
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,240
I don't know.

123
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,080
To be more popular, maybe?

124
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,360
-Everyone does it.
-Right, sure.

125
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,480
Alma...

126
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,880
That shit will ruin your self-esteem

127
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,440
and attract the eyes of bad people.
Got it? Very bad.

128
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,960
You're different.
You don't have to do what everyone does.

129
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,440
Next week, I can't come
to the orientation classes.

130
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,720
But Andrea will be with you.

131
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,440
Okay?

132
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,800
Are you okay?

133
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,880
Yes.

134
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,160
Right, you can go.

135
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,560
That last photo you posted
is fucking great.

136
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,680
We have double the likes.
You were right to push it.

137
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,400
You know what? I had another idea.

138
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,760
We could take a photo of his car
with some dirty tissues lying around,

139
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,000
like he was cleaning it up.

140
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,000
You get me, right?

141
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,200
I thought it all happened at school.

142
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,840
It did, but some girl could see the car
and recognize it, right?

143
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,560
I don't know.

144
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,880
What's wrong?

145
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,040
Nothing.

146
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,840
The page isn't working as you expected.
You're frustrated and want to stop, right?

147
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,280
No, it's not that.

148
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,920
You're sick of me.

149
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,680
No, Berta. Please don't cry, okay?

150
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,360
So, what's wrong?

151
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,560
I don't know
if we're doing the right thing.

152
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,360
But why?

153
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,640
Why have you suddenly changed...

154
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You spoke to him.

155
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,600
I went to the meetings.

156
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,640
-I asked you not to.
-Nothing happened.

157
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,640
He didn't try anything with you,
so what I told you is a lie, right?

158
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,440
Did you talk about me?

159
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,360
No.

160
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,200
You've taken his side.

161
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,360
Berta, sit down.

162
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,560
No! I knew I shouldn't have told you!

163
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,320
Fucking stop already!

164
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,840
-Stop!
-Berta!

165
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,200
-Fuck!
-Berta, cut it out!

166
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,480
Never fucking speak to me again!

167
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,680
Stop, for fuck's sake!

168
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,000
Please, let her off.
This girl's crazy. She'll hurt herself.

169
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,480
-Stop the fucking bus!
-Berta, please, stop!

170
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,280
Please!

171
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,240
Berta, wait. Talk to me, okay?

172
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,200
-Leave me the fuck alone!
-I believe you, okay?

173
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,040
-No.
-Okay, I'm sorry.

174
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,440
You're a fucking liar.

175
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,880
-A fucking sellout!
-I'm sorry.

176
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,760
I'm sorry, Berta. Listen to me!

177
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,280
No! I hate you!

178
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,080
You've ruined my fucking life!

179
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,880
It's all shit.

180
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,840
No!

181
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,840
TRAFFIC POLICE

182
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,200
Can you stay with me?

183
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,160
Sure.

184
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,560
It wasn't your fault.

185
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,680
Okay?

186
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,920
Let's try to sleep.

187
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,560
Look at this.

188
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,320
-This is our bathroom, isn't it?
-Whose profile is it?

189
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,480
Someone called Coleman Miller.

190
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,200
It says she was raped.

191
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,560
<i>What is it?</i>

192
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,240
Let me through.

193
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,160
Let's go.

194
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,120
What's going on?

195
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,040
A student was raped in the bathroom.

196
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:58,960
Who?

197
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,880
We don't know.

198
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,040
Her username is Iam_colemanmiller.

199
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,280
<i>Let's not get carried away with hysteria.</i>

200
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,560
<i>It may be a joke.</i>

201
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,520
No one jokes about this.

202
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,600
Still, we should treat it discreetly.

203
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,080
You can't stop it now.

204
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,640
Three hundred students are sharing it

205
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,240
and commenting on social media
that a student at this school

206
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,840
suffered sexual abuse.

207
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,880
Even worse.

208
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,920
It says that a student
suffered abuse <i>in</i> this school.

209
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,840
That preposition changes everything.

210
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,480
Natacha, not now.
Whatever it is will have to wait.

211
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,200
Coleman Miller...

212
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,240
is Alma.

213
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,560
How do you know?

214
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,080
I recognize the T-shirt.
She made it herself.

215
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,640
Was Alma raped?

216
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,640
Police central operations unit.
How can I help you?

217
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,960
I'll put you through
to the Female Minor Unit.

218
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,640
I was trying to roll a cigarette, but...

219
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,640
Give it here.

220
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,280
Thanks.

221
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,400
FEMALE MINOR UNIT

222
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,800
Alma?

223
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,720
<i>For the record,
I'm Sergeant Mercedes García,</i>

224
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,080
from the police's Female Minor Unit.

225
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,000
Well,

226
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,800
how are you, Alma?

227
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,400
I'll just ask you some questions, okay?

228
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,200
Who is Coleman Miller?

229
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,520
I am.

230
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,760
I'm Coleman Miller.

231
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,360
Are you the person
in the photos on that profile?

232
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,160
Yes.

233
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,960
I'm going to read your first post.

234
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,240
"This is me before I was raped."

235
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,840
Did you write it?

236
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,520
Yes.

237
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,160
Alma, are you okay?

238
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,880
Just a bit tired.

239
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,000
I understand.

240
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,720
I know it's hard.

241
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,520
But to open an investigation,
I need you to talk to me.

242
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,120
I know that. It's just...

243
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,760
Did you make this story up?

244
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,760
No.

245
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,120
Then tell me what's going on.

246
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,640
Only you know the whole truth.

247
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,880
You promised me.

248
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,120
You mustn't tell anyone.

249
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,280
Two months ago, I was run over by a car,

250
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,520
and I ran into my friend Berta
in the hospital.

251
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,800
She told me...

252
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,200
that a teacher raped her
for almost an entire school year.

253
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,440
STATEMENT FROM THE MINOR B.O.U.

254
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,040
<i>Good morning. Is Alma there?</i>

255
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,840
-Yes.
<i>-I need to talk to her.</i>

256
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,200
Come in.

257
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,320
<i>I spoke to Berta's parents,
and I've looked into it.</i>

258
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,000
Did you know your friend
had psychological issues

259
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,160
and was in treatment?

260
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,680
Yes, she told me that she had
a lot of problems after the abuse.

261
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,160
Actually,

262
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,320
the cause-effect relationship
couldn't be proven.

263
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,360
I don't know what you mean.

264
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:44,960
Well,

265
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,440
Berta was diagnosed
with borderline personality disorder

266
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,000
when she was 12,

267
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,560
long before she reported your teacher.

268
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,480
She reported it?

269
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,040
She told me she'd never told anyone.

270
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Well, she did.

271
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,400
An investigation was opened,

272
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,720
but in the end, it was determined
that the abuse hadn't happened

273
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,480
because she withdrew the accusation.

274
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,120
She lied?

275
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,680
I don't know.

276
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,840
I've spent the night going over the case,

277
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,840
and with no evidence
or a formal complaint,

278
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,480
our hands are tied.

279
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,480
The case is closed.

280
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,840
Alma.

281
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,120
Are you okay?

282
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,320
<i>"This page is fake."</i>

283
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,560
<i>"No one raped that girl."</i>

284
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,360
"<i>She's in my school, and her name's Alma."</i>

285
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,440
<i>"Don't believe a word of what she says."</i>

286
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,280
<i>"She's a liar."</i>

287
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,880
I told you not to tell anyone.

288
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,560
García, I have a girl here
who wants to speak to you.

289
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,400
-Can you deal with it, please?
-It's about Coleman Miller.

290
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,360
Hi.

291
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,280
I'm Sergeant Mercedes García.

292
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,440
How can I help you?

293
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,880
I wanted to talk to you about this.

294
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,840
"The school board hereby informs you
of the decision to suspend your daughter

295
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,920
in response
to the violation of article 19b

296
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,680
of the internal regulations
on student conduct."

297
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,280
What a bummer, Alma.

298
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,600
Right.

299
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,240
At least your cop friend was nice

300
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,080
and didn't make a fuss
about my fake account

301
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,760
about a false rape.

302
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,000
Berta was kind of messed up in the head

303
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,560
and said weird stuff, Alma.

304
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,000
She was so convincing about it all.

305
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,280
Every detail. All of it.

306
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,240
Maybe I'm the crazy one.

307
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,600
What will you do now?

308
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,960
Your brother asked me
to go to the end of the world with him.

309
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,240
I said no, but...

310
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,560
maybe I should rethink it.

311
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,640
Even more so after this.

312
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,040
Have you seen it?

313
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,440
What?

314
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,440
Look.

315
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,920
There are thousands of accounts
saying they want me dead.

316
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,160
What's this?

317
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:49,720
Look, delete the comments
or the whole profile, and that's it.

318
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,280
Good God.

319
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,920
Then there are these,

320
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,200
which are funny.

321
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,080
I feed their creativity.

322
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,360
I'm their muse.

323
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,040
People are crazy.

324
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,960
I screwed up, huh?

325
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,480
I screwed up big time.

326
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,040
I accused the only teacher who helped me
of being a rapist.

327
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,080
Go to school tomorrow and talk to him.

328
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,400
Apologize to him.

329
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,120
Apologize to him.

330
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,320
He'll understand.

331
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,040
Are you okay?

332
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,600
Run, okay?

333
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,600
Go on, run.

334
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,720
I'm going to tell everyone what you do.

335
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,040
I don't know what you mean.

336
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,640
Yes, you do.

337
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,600
What's wrong?

338
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,920
Help us set the table.

339
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,680
We need to talk.

340
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,600
What's wrong?

341
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,360
Berta was right.

342
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,920
My teacher abused her,
and he's abusing another girl right now.

343
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,360
-Alma...
-Mom, please.

344
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,720
Listen to me, okay?

345
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,720
-We have to call the police.
-It won't do any good.

346
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,120
Besides, right now,
I have zero credibility.

347
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,040
You could convince her to report it.

348
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,280
She's terrified. I can't do that to her.

349
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,720
And he'd deny it all.

350
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,760
What do you want to do?

351
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,440
<i>Shall we fight?</i>

352
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,560
Tooth and nail, okay?

353
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,480
Okay.

354
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,640
Alma!

355
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,920
Let's see.

356
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,680
Are you all right?

357
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,440
I'm not crying.

358
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,440
-I'm not giving up.
-Really?

359
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,960
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

360
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:53,880
Let's go.

361
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,960
Technically, I'm not smoking
inside the house.

362
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,400
You could clean up the butts
in the plants someday.

363
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,960
Someday.

364
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,520
You can't sleep.

365
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,400
Dad.

366
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,920
I get that this could cause me problems,

367
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,560
but I have to do it.

368
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,360
-I must do it.
-I know.

369
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,480
It's right.

370
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,520
I want you to know
I'm proud to be your father.

371
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,680
You were always a brave girl.

372
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,320
Tooth and nail, remember?

373
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,080
I forgot that.

374
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,200
I don't know when, but I did, and...

375
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,240
I'm sorry for how I treated you
all this time.

376
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,080
The things I said to you, and...

377
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,360
I'm sorry I hit you.

378
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,960
I didn't make it easy for you.

379
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,880
Don't say that. It's not true.

380
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,840
Please, forgive me.

381
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,600
I'm going to have to repeat my final year.

382
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,120
It's all right.

383
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,560
We'll find another school.

384
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,600
Or not.

385
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,880
Choose your own path.

386
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,840
I'll always be by your side.

387
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:08,680
If you want to run away to sea,
just let me know the dock to say goodbye.

388
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,120
I'll be there.

389
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,160
-<i>You're trash.
-You're a slut.</i>

390
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,640
<i>You've got shit for brains.</i>

391
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,720
<i>Don't go to school.</i>

392
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,600
<i>You're in time to avoid a real fuckup.</i>

393
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,520
<i>Alma, stay at home. Don't do it.</i>

394
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,120
Drop me off here.

395
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,160
This is fine.

396
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,720
Shall I go with you?

397
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,200
No, no need.

398
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,400
I'll be around.

399
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,440
Just in case, okay?

400
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,640
Thanks.

401
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:25,880
Go.

402
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,240
{\an8}MARTIN BAUSSEN PRIVATE SCHOOL

403
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:04,040
Hey, come see this.
Alma is causing trouble again.

404
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,280
Guys, look. It's Alma.

405
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,320
-What's she doing?
-Who knows?

406
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,240
Is she crazy?

407
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,920
Let me see.

408
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
BEWARE! A RAPIST IS HIDING IN THERE!

409
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,200
I don't get why she does it.

410
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,200
Fuck, Mai, she's crazy.

411
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,240
She'll get expelled for this.

412
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,840
Screw her.

413
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,680
-Should I call her parents?
-No.

414
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,640
I'm calling the police.

415
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:14,240
BEWARE! A RAPIST IS HIDING IN THERE!

416
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,240
-It's Alma. She left yesterday.
-Good God.

417
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,920
It's okay. I promise you
it won't happen again.

418
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,360
POSTING

419
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,480
What's wrong?

420
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,880
{\an8}<i>This is the face of a rapist.</i>

421
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,240
{\an8}<i>He's one of the teachers at my school.</i>

422
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,560
Fucking bitch.

423
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,560
<i>I'm sure that right now,
he's abusing another girl</i>.

424
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,760
<i>He's a sexual predator.</i>

425
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:51,920
Alma.

426
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,320
Hi.

427
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,280
I'm shaking.

428
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,600
Don't worry. I'm here, okay?

429
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,600
-Get her out.
-I called the pol...

430
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,600
-Get her out of there!
-There are more.

431
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,840
Shit.

432
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,760
Go back to your classes.

433
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,800
Take down that sheet at once
and get out of the school.

434
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,120
I'm not moving.

435
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,840
We've called the police.
There will be consequences.

436
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,600
I hope so.

437
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,560
Go back to class.

438
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,080
Go back to class!

439
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,560
Go back to your classes, please.

440
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,680
Stay where you are. Go back to class.

441
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,120
What a bunch of sluts and assholes.

442
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,520
Fuck, she's got some ovaries.

443
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,760
Nata, everyone knows
that Alma's a fucking liar.

444
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,600
I believe her.

445
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,600
Alma wouldn't make this up.

446
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,640
And I should've reported all of you.

447
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,480
-What? Shut your mouth.
-Not likely.

448
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,800
Alma's right. You should wear a sign
to warn people what shits you are.

449
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,760
Want us to bring up your fantasies?

450
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,320
No, actually.

451
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,320
We're leaving that subject
in the same place as our relationship.

452
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,600
What does that mean?

453
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,000
It means it's over.

454
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:29,120
I'm leaving you in the same corridor
where I first noticed you.

455
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,520
Nata, you love me.

456
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,560
There's no reason for us to split up.

457
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,640
-No?
-No.

458
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,120
What about sending photos of your dick
to my best friend?

459
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,640
You know sending that kind of porn
is a crime, right?

460
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,280
-What? Are you crazy?
-Totally crazy.

461
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:47,720
So crazy that I'm reporting you
to the school board. They'll expel you.

462
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,280
For fuck's sake, please.

463
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,840
Goodbye, Alberto.

464
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,760
Out of the way, idiot.

465
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,600
Nata!

466
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,440
One more thing.

467
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,960
They'll have to call the police,
so forget fucking Canada.

468
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,520
They don't want pigs like you.

469
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:12,480
I told you to get back to class! Everyone!

470
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,280
Get inside. Stay...

471
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,960
I'm asking you
to go back to your classes now, please.

472
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,080
There will be consequences for everyone.

473
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,840
Go back to class! Now!

474
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,480
Go back to class!
I won't say it again! Please!

475
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,920
Out of the way, please.

476
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,320
Let me through, guys, please.

477
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,600
Guys.

478
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,360
You got here quickly.

479
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,480
We were on the way when you called us.

480
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,560
Come with us.

481
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,560
<i>Get out, bastard!</i>

482
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,280
<i>Get out!</i>

483
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,200
<i>-Son of a bitch!
-Disgusting!</i>

484
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,840
<i>-Get out!
-Get out!</i>

485
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,200
You did it this time, huh?

486
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,600
Why did you arrest him?

487
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,800
A student at another school
saw your Instagram profile.

488
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,800
She reported him.

489
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,120
I'm not ruling out more victims.

490
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:05,040
Maybe you should talk to her.

491
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,880
Thanks.

492
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,560
-What's your name?
-Bambi.

493
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,920
Can we talk for a minute?

494
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,400
Come with me.

495
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,520

<i>Hi, guys. I have incredible news.</i>

498
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,080
<i>I've been hired as a community manager</i>

499
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,760
for DJ Bárbara Lago.

500
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:37,320
I'm going with her
on a three-month European tour.

501
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,720
I can't believe it.

502
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:39,760
Wish me luck.

503
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:50,240
My brother's at the end of the world,
you're leaving, too,

504
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:52,760
and I'm here.

505
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,320
You're abandoning me.

506
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,360
Did he write?

507
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:01,440
And not to you?

508
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,680
Although he doesn't want to admit it,

509
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,760
you broke his heart.

510
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:13,960
I didn't lie to him.

511
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,600
Just a fuck, right?

512
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,560
I'll miss you.

513
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,200
I'll miss you too.

514
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,040
It's just three months.

515
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:42,440
And you'll be super busy
with college and stuff.

516
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:47,280
Besides, I'll write to you and call you,
and it'll be like I was here.

517
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:52,920
Yes.

518
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,680
If I have an off day
and want to kiss you and I can't,

519
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,160
I may get really sad, maybe even die...

520
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,560
You're a great manipulator,
Greta Hernández.

521
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:08,520
Come here.

522
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,240
Did your hair stand on end?

523
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,320
My pussy hair, yes.

524
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,560
Hey, crazy lesbian! Help!

525
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,920
-It's a lot of luggage, isn't it?
-See?

526
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,240
It's three months, Dad.

527
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,400
Are you sure this is what you want to do?

528
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,000
I'll give it a shot.

529
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:45,640
-If anything goes wrong, come right back.
-Don't worry, I'll be fine.

530
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,400
I know. You're a brave girl.

531
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,480
Call me every day.

532
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:50,920
Sure, I will.

533
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,240
Come on, let's go.

534
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,040
Come on.

535
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,240
Get out of my house!

536
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:34,440
