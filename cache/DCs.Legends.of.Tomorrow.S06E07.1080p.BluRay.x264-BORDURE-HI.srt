She's gone, Nate.

- Okay.

If you need anything,

We just need to give her some space.

When I lost Behrad,
that's what I needed.

Speaking of, where's B?

49

Oh, he won't leave the lab.

50
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:38,117
He's taking Sara's death
almost as hard as Ava.

51
00:02:38,451 --> 00:02:40,536
All right, so we'll give Ava space,

Merging alien and human DNA.
I knew that was the answer,

87
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:45,453
but it turns out, that kind of merger

88
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:48,039
requires an awesome degree
of mental fortitude.

89

00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:22,712
Hey, did you think
we wouldn't notice?

166
00:08:22,795 --> 00:08:25,006
There are a million reasons
why I shouldn't do this,

167
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:28,050
but I'll stop Sara from being abducted
and dying and you can't stop me.

168
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:29,468
Stop you?

169
00:08:29,552 --> 00:08:31,012
We're here to help you do it right.

170
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:32,555
[chuckles softly]

171
00:08:32,638 --> 00:08:33,931
Yeah.

172
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:38,394
[people cheering and shouting]

173
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,068
Should we really be strategizing
across from The Hole?

174
00:08:46,152 --> 00:08:47,820
None of us came here
that night, mate.

175
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:50,865
The only other building in the area
was a fireworks factory.

176
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:52,366
Hey, so, what's the plan, bro?

177
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:54,702
All right, we need to get Sara
onto the <i>Waverider</i>

178
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:58,414
before the aliens arrive.
I'm thinking, fire alarm.

179
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:00,541
No, The Hole
doesn't have fire alarms.

180
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:03,669
The place is a death trap.
I felt like I was back in hell.

181
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:06,797
- Why don't we ask Ava for a plan?
- No, no, no, no.

182
00:09:06,881 --> 00:09:09,592
Ava would never allow
something like this. It's too risky.

183
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:11,135
It's up to us to save Sara

184
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:13,345
without interacting
with our former selves.

185
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:15,806
So, at any point during the night,

186
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:17,141
did anyone slip away

187
00:09:17,142 --> 00:09:18,768
that would give us
a window to step in?

188
00:09:18,851 --> 00:09:20,770
Honestly, mate,
that night was a blur.

189
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:21,937
Do you remember anything?

190
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:25,107
Well, I said goodbye forever
to the love of my life,

191
00:09:25,191 --> 00:09:28,444
so, yeah, it went pretty hard. Blur.

192
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:30,696
Look, if we can pull this off,

193
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,073
we not only save Sara,

194
00:09:32,156 --> 00:09:35,034
but we prevent aliens
from scattering across the timeline.

195
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:38,412
Wait, if there are never any aliens,
I never look for Spooner.

196
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:40,706
And I never join you.

197
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,541
[Spooner laughs]

198
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:46,337
I mean, y'all are great,
but there were perks to my old life.

199
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,881
You know, never getting attacked
by alien Amelia Earhart,

200
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:50,674
never getting turned into a fork.

201
00:09:50,758 --> 00:09:52,009
That was one time.

202
00:09:52,093 --> 00:09:53,511
Don't trust you.

203
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:54,594
[jingle plays on watch]

204
00:09:54,637 --> 00:09:57,139
All right. Smoke o'clock.

205
00:09:57,765 --> 00:10:00,976
Wait. That's it.

206
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,270
I smoke every night at midnight

207
00:10:03,354 --> 00:10:06,107
and tonight,
I went on the roof to smoke.

208
00:10:06,816 --> 00:10:08,692
That means the other you
is not involved.

209
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:10,402
And I could get Sara
on the <i>Waverider!</i>

210
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:13,989
"Sara, the Fates are back."

211
00:10:14,073 --> 00:10:15,449
Nah, too obvious.

212
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:18,869
"Sara, your sister and dad called."

213
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:21,247
Are they even alive in this timeline?

214
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:25,708
B?

215
00:10:26,502 --> 00:10:30,005
Yes, it's me,
your current friend, Behrad.

216
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:31,841
[chuckles] Okay.

217
00:10:31,924 --> 00:10:33,968
You're needed
on the <i>Waverider</i> immediately.

218
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:36,345
It's a Timequake wave-mergency.

219
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:38,264
That's the beauty
of having a time machine.

220
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:40,599
I can always
just go back in time and fix it.

221
00:10:40,683 --> 00:10:41,683
But, Sara...

222
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:43,519
B, look, I'm not gonna go, all right?

223
00:10:45,855 --> 00:10:47,773
I'm gonna tell you
a little secret.

224
00:10:47,857 --> 00:10:48,857
Okay.

225
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:50,943
[Sara] I just picked this up,

226
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:54,363
because I am going to propose
to Ava tonight.

227
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:57,741
Where'd you get this?
Versailles? The Romanovs?

228
00:10:57,825 --> 00:10:58,825
My mom.

229
00:10:58,993 --> 00:11:01,871
Go figure.
Sara Lance, old school romantic.

230
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:04,290
Yeah, you know me,
and tonight is the night

231
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:06,208
and nothing,
not even a timeline emergency,

232
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:08,127
is gonna get in my way.

233
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,295
There you are.

234
00:11:09,378 --> 00:11:10,921
- [laughing] Hey.
- Hey.

235
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:14,133
[laughing] What are you two doing?

236
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:15,342
[Behrad] Just talking rings,

237
00:11:15,426 --> 00:11:17,052
- fates, looms...
- Yeah.

238
00:11:17,136 --> 00:11:19,054
- ...you know, recap stuff?
- Mmm.

239
00:11:19,138 --> 00:11:21,432
Whoa. Wasn't that silver streak
in your hair

240
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:22,641
on the other side before?

241
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:25,644
Yeah, actually.

242
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:27,897
Oh. [chuckles]

243
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,398
Babe, Charlie's about to go on.

244
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:30,542
- [Sara] Yes, let's go.
- Come on.

245
00:11:30,566 --> 00:11:32,234
- Come on.
- I'll meet you inside.

246
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,860
You're not coming?

247
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:35,487
Smoke o'clock.

248
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:36,906
Oh.

249
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:39,532
[sighs]

250
00:11:50,628 --> 00:11:51,712
[Gary] Stop!

251
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:53,839
Avas are on our side.

252
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:55,633
They're helping us rescue you.

253
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:56,716
- Us?
- Yeah.

254
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,304
Mick, oh, my God. You're alive.

255
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,431
He flew here with Kayla.

256
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:04,350
Wait, why didn't she try to eat you?

257
00:12:05,351 --> 00:12:07,603
- We gotta go.
- I can't until I stop Bishop.

258
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:09,688
He's got this crazy
intergalactic plan

259
00:12:09,772 --> 00:12:10,772
to try to clone me.

260
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:13,317
A planet of cloned Avas and Saras?

261
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,902
Are we sure we want to stop that?

262
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:16,987
Um, I speak for all the Avas when I say

263
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:19,031
it would be an honor
to help thwart him.

264
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:20,658
Great. How do we do it?

265
00:12:20,783 --> 00:12:22,701
Redundancy is Bishop's religion.

266
00:12:22,785 --> 00:12:25,037
If we take down one generator,
the backup kicks in.

267
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,373
But I guess if we destroy them
all simultaneously,

268
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:28,666
his operation would go down.

269
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:29,989
[Mick] You better make it fast.

270
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:32,586
When those moons set, Kayla's gone.

271
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,880
All right, let's split up.
We can cover more ground.

272
00:12:34,964 --> 00:12:36,215
I'll get some explosives.

273
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:38,676
Thank you for finding me.

274
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:40,469
The ship sucked without you.

275
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,470
Come on.

276
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,059
Sara's not leaving
until she proposes to Ava.

277
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:48,811
Yeah, but Sara never
proposed that night.

278
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:49,936
Why not?

279
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:53,691
No clue.
But if we get Sara to propose,

280
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:55,651
she can get on the ship
before the aliens.

281
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:58,445
Unfortunately, we were all
with Sara the rest of the night.

282
00:12:58,654 --> 00:13:01,073
Not all of us.

283
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:07,705
Do you two have something you want
to share with the rest of the class?

284
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:10,582
There is a 20-minute window

285
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,668
where we'll be
out of the picture.

286
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:14,378
More like a generous ten.

287
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:15,754
- Fifteen.
- Eight.

288
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:18,299
Just go get Sara to propose.

289
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:21,135
[loud rock music playing]

290
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:23,178
Where the bloody hell is Sara, eh?

291
00:13:26,098 --> 00:13:27,433
Hey, girl!

292
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:28,766
Hi.

293
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:31,270
Have you seen Sara?

294
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:32,688
Yeah, she's in the bathroom. Why?

295
00:13:34,398 --> 00:13:36,817
She borrowed my makeup,

296
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,902
and John needs it now.

297
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:42,531
You look great.
So good to see you. [chuckles]

298
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:46,909
[hesitates]

299
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:50,748
[retching]

300
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:53,709
Sara, are you all right?

301
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:55,294
- [toilet flushing]
- Are you pissed?

302
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:58,088
[sighs] No, I think
I just need to drink more,

303
00:13:58,172 --> 00:13:59,214
and a mint.

304
00:14:00,132 --> 00:14:02,343
She's nervous about proposing.

305
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:04,094
Wait, how did you...

306
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:05,386
Ugh!

307
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:06,472
Behrad!

308
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:08,432
Yeah, you listen to me, all right?

309
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:12,019
You are Sara freaking Lance.
Now, who's gonna turn you down, eh?

310
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:13,854
Now, go out there,
get on bended knee,

311
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:14,854
you put a ring on it

312
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:16,815
and you take that lady home
to celebrate, okay?

313
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:18,359
'Cause you deserve it.

314
00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:19,610
What's it to you?

315
00:14:20,069 --> 00:14:21,153
What?

316
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:24,490
I just love love.

317
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:27,409
"You just love love"?

318
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:28,869
Yeah.

319
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,163
Hey, Charlie, is that you?

320
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:33,207
Just stop messing with me,
all right?

321
00:14:33,499 --> 00:14:36,919
I'm gonna do it my way, in my time.

322
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:38,462
[Constantine inhales sharply] God.

323
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:42,049
- Hey, what was that?
- What was what?

324
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:44,718
Willingness to go along
with a crazy plan,

325
00:14:44,802 --> 00:14:47,679
corny lines about love.
This is somehow about you.

326
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:53,185
You don't have your magic,
do you?

327
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:55,437
And before?

328
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,066
- Astra covered for me.
- Yup.

329
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:00,442
Rehab's not working, all right?

330
00:15:00,526 --> 00:15:03,320
I say the words,
but I can't... rekindle the flame.

331
00:15:03,404 --> 00:15:04,488
Resetting the timeline,

332
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,448
it's my only chance
of getting my magic back.

333
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:09,576
Yeah, and you thought telling Sara
you love love would be your best bet?

334
00:15:10,369 --> 00:15:11,745
- Too much?
- Yeah.

335
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:13,287
Right.

336
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,415
- Hey, John.
- Yeah?

337
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:15,790
No more lies.

338
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:20,212
- The words.
- No more lies.

339
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:24,466
Good. Okay.
Now we have to find the team

340
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,427
and come up with a plan C
to save Sara.

341
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,470
Yeah, and a plan D to save me.

342
00:15:28,554 --> 00:15:30,597
[loud rock music continues]

343
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:31,681
Wow.

344
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,532
- She's nervous?
- How do we fix that?

345
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:50,324
[515 Agent Sharpe] Hey!

346
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:52,703
I knew it.

347
00:15:52,704 --> 00:15:54,496
- [clears throat]
- Oh! Hey, girl.

348
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,331
Uh, we were just...

349
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,750
Celebrating the finale.

350
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:01,462
By eating mushroom curry like we do!

351
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:03,088
You and those Shake Weights?

352
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:04,673
Sisqó, am I right?

353
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:07,759
Don't even.
I know you're not my Legends, okay?

354
00:16:07,843 --> 00:16:09,094
And where am I, huh?

355
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:10,596
Nowhere. Which is how I know

356
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:13,682
that whatever you're all doing
is a terrible idea. Okay?

357
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:16,894
[gasps] Am I dead? No, never mind.
Don't answer that, please.

358
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:18,020
Did you nod your head?

359
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:20,272
- [Nate] Hmm?
- Okay, girl, you're right.

360
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:21,690
We are from the future.

361
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:23,192
But we have a really good reason.

362
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:25,944
No, no, stop.
I don't wanna hear any more words.

363
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:27,571
How many missions
is it gonna take

364
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:29,198
for you to realize
that you can't

365
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:30,281
change the past.

366
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:31,992
It always causes millions of ripples.

367
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:33,911
That's the danger
of what you're doing here.

368
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:35,579
It is chaos to the timeline.

369
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,223
- So, you're taking our drinks?
- [Agent Sharpe] No.

370
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:38,457
They're for me, because, now,

371
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,727
I have to get blackout drunk
to forget that this ever happened.

372
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:42,127
Damn it. Mmm!

373
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:44,254
All of you, back to your timelines.

374
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:46,715
- I'm not even kidding. That's an order.
- Oh!

375
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,676
[both sigh]

376
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:55,807
Jeez. I don't think y'all
would be this upset about losing me.

377
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:00,020
This isn't about me, is it?

378
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:01,396
[horn honking]

[tires screeching]

380

Come on! I'm walkin' here.

381
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:11,698
Arriving at the last
generator now, Mick.

[grunts]

Aah!

384
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,291
Oh, no.

385
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:25,379
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. It's just...

386
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:30,132
Wow.

387
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:32,344
Have you always been able to do that?

388
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:33,637
Regeneration.

389
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:35,304
[gasps softly]

390
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:37,474
Bishop. What did he do?

391
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:39,142
I swear I have no idea.

392
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:42,563
[beeps]

393
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:43,813
Finish up here.

394
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:48,694
Stand by on blowing up the generators.

395
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:51,405
There's someone I gotta see first.

396
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:53,782
[soul pop song playing]

397

00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:02,291
<i>You really got me going...</i>

400

[grunts]

401
00:18:08,714 --> 00:18:10,674
What have you done to me?

402
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:18,974
Shouldn't you be... Oh, the Avas.

403
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:21,018
That one's on me.
Should have seen it coming.

404
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:22,311
What did you do?

405
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:24,563
Show-and-tell time.

406
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:25,689
[beeps]

407
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:29,651
What the hell is that?

00:18:29,735 --> 00:18:33,572
That... [grunts] is you.

409
00:18:34,406 --> 00:18:36,992
I merged you with this beauty,

410
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:40,495
making you the Eve
of alien human hybrids.

411
00:18:41,413 --> 00:18:42,831
You're welcome. [grunts]

412
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:48,337
This is getting a bit tiresome.

413
00:18:49,046 --> 00:18:50,088
What's the big plan?

414
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:54,009
You're gonna kill me? Again?
[imitates snoring]

415
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:55,135
Not this time.

[groaning]

No new Bishops.
You're stuck with this one.

418
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:04,186
Now tell me
how to make myself human again.

419
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:07,773
This is just your pain cycle
speaking, Sara.

420
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:11,568
Look past your rage, Sara,

421
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:13,320
and imagine the possibilities.

422
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:14,446
You with wings.

423
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:17,699
You with the ability to live
in sub-zero temperatures.

424
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:19,158
Fun!

425
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:24,456
You've fought so hard
to save the timeline, but for what?

426
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,500
Humanity has no future without me,

427
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,126
without us.

428
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:31,213
[singing] <i>So what do you say?</i>

429
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:32,714
Hard pass.

430
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:33,840
And if you won't fix me,

431
00:19:33,924 --> 00:19:35,884
then I'll make
a clean clone of myself

432
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:38,762
and then,
I'm gonna blow up this place

433
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:40,222
and get the hell off this planet.

434
00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:41,556
Good luck with that.

435
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:44,184
No generators means
no electrostatic barrier,

436
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:47,062
which means, yes, Zagurons.

437
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:49,272
If I were you,
I wouldn't book a venue

438
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:51,024
for your wedding just yet.

439
00:19:52,818 --> 00:19:54,569
Goodbye, Bishop.

440
00:19:56,405 --> 00:19:57,572
[sighs]

441
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:05,455
Behind y'all.

442
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:07,082
Mmm. Thank you.

443
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:08,833
Ew.

444
00:20:09,835 --> 00:20:11,670
[sighs] I mean,
honestly, leave it to Ava

445
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:13,672
to bring up some very valid concerns.

446
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:16,174
Very valid concernitunities.

447
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:19,177
Exactly. We need to get creative.

448
00:20:19,845 --> 00:20:21,430
We need to find a way
to get Sara back

449
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:23,265
and make sure
everything stays the same.

450
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:24,975
So, our present doesn't change.

451
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:26,935
And I still join the Legends.

452
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:29,479
Shh. Okay, so, how?

453
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:30,563
I might have a way.

454
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:33,483
With a mannequin?

455
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:34,735
No!

456
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:37,863
With an exploding mannequin.

457
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:41,241
Ava.

458
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:44,953
- [gasps] There you are.
- Can you make a clean version of me?

459
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:46,997
Me? No.

460
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,458
Bishop does all the cloning.
He's the brilliant scientist.

461
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:53,128
Yeah, but you were
the brilliant nurse who helped him.

462
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:54,379
[nurse Ava] Hmm?

463
00:20:54,463 --> 00:20:55,881
I know that you can do this.

464
00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:58,258
All right? I trust you.

465
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:03,179
[Sara sighs]

466
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:06,142
Sara, the generators
are ready to blow.

467
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:08,727
Give me that.
We have to get to the ship now.

468
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:11,813
You go. I'll meet you there.

469
00:21:11,897 --> 00:21:12,897
[static crackles]

470
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:14,900
Did she just hang up on me?

471
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:21,364
How many bowls is that?

472
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:25,285
What's the point of time travel
if I can't enjoy the local cuisine?

473
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:28,663
B, I love you, and I co-sign your
creativity 100%, but this plan is...

474
00:21:28,747 --> 00:21:29,873
- Is rubbish, mate.
- Yeah.

475
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:31,625
[Astra] Those fireworks need to go off.

476
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,919
at just the right time,
in just the right place

477
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:35,712
with just the right amount of force.

478
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:37,547
I don't like those odds.

479
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:41,426
And that hair is trag.
The alien is definitely gonna know.

480
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,136
Gary is on the ship.

481
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:45,263
He'll pick up
what I'm laying down here.

482
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:48,600
I had Gideon run a reverse model
on the pods' disbursement.

483
00:21:48,683 --> 00:21:52,729
And accounting for temporal drift,
in 12 hours and 14 minutes,

484
00:21:52,813 --> 00:21:55,565
the ship will be
in the exact location it was

485
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:57,776
when Sara sent aliens
into the timeline.

486
00:21:57,859 --> 00:21:59,110
The bomb goes boom,

487
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:00,779
scattering aliens
across the timeline.

488
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:02,906
We get our Sara back.

489
00:22:04,366 --> 00:22:07,077
All I need now
is my woman on the inside.

490
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,995
All right, I'm here. Now what?

491
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:10,413
[Behrad] <i>Keep your eyes peeled.</i>

492
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:12,457
<i>Let me know when the Legends
are on the move.</i>

493
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:13,541
<i>And whatever you do,</i>

494
00:22:13,917 --> 00:22:15,544
don't interact with Sara.

495
00:22:15,836 --> 00:22:18,839
Look, I don't even know the lady.
What would I possibly say to her?

496
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,758
Hey. How's it going?

497
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,561
[rock music playing]

498
00:22:32,894 --> 00:22:33,894
Rough night?

499
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:36,773
I've been having a weird one myself.

500
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:38,649
Cheers.

501
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:45,198
So, lay it on me.

502
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:50,245
Oh, come on. I could use a distraction.

503
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:55,457
What the hell.

504
00:22:57,502 --> 00:23:01,131
Twenty years ago,
I was abducted by aliens.

505
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:04,217
But they did something to me,
and ever since, I, uh...

506
00:23:04,301 --> 00:23:08,638
I feel things,
hear voices from aliens,

507
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:10,348
and it's freaking me out.

508
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:13,143
What if there's something
inside me that I can't control?

509
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:15,854
And the people I live with,

510
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:19,941
well, they're gonna think
I'm some kind of monster.

511
00:23:23,945 --> 00:23:25,405
And now you think I'm crazy.

512
00:23:26,364 --> 00:23:27,532
Crazy is the word people use

513
00:23:27,616 --> 00:23:29,534
when they're afraid
of what you're capable of.

514
00:23:29,618 --> 00:23:32,037
I'm not afraid. I am intrigued.

515
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:36,625
Man, you really are cool.

516
00:23:38,585 --> 00:23:40,837
Look, it sounds like
you're on the beginning

517
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:41,963
of an amazing journey.

518
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:45,467
And if I could give you
one piece of advice from experience,

519
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,843
don't go at it alone.

520
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:48,386
What if I hurt them?

521
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:50,138
What if they help you?

522
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:52,599
What if I can't live up
to their expectations?

523
00:23:53,183 --> 00:23:54,267
Hmm.

524
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:56,144
Yeah, I feel you on that one.

525
00:23:57,187 --> 00:23:58,313
[sighs]

526
00:23:58,396 --> 00:23:59,856
I was supposed to propose

527
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,442
to my girlfriend tonight,
and then I realized

528
00:24:03,735 --> 00:24:05,403
that she's probably gonna say yes.

529
00:24:06,863 --> 00:24:08,949
That's great, right?

530
00:24:09,741 --> 00:24:11,993
I have been
so many different people in my life,

531
00:24:12,077 --> 00:24:15,455
and I'm worried
that this version of me

532
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:18,166
might just be a phase.

533
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,544
And I would get a lifetime
of the woman I love,

534
00:24:22,712 --> 00:24:25,298
but I can't promise
she'd get the same in return.

535
00:24:27,217 --> 00:24:28,969
Look, I just met you,

536
00:24:29,052 --> 00:24:31,888
and I certainly
don't know your girlfriend,

537
00:24:31,972 --> 00:24:34,766
but, uh, my gut tells me
that she can handle change.

538
00:24:35,266 --> 00:24:36,893
It might even be good for her.

539
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,020
And what if I hurt her?

540
00:24:40,689 --> 00:24:41,773
What if you help her?

541
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:42,941
[song ends]

542
00:24:43,024 --> 00:24:44,024
[people cheering]

543
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:46,695
We're The Smell.

544
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:51,199
Welcome to the best show
of your lives, you wankers!

545
00:24:51,282 --> 00:24:52,575
[new song begins]

[all cheering]

547
00:24:55,996 --> 00:24:58,957
She's perfect just the way she is.

548
00:25:01,626 --> 00:25:04,587
Maybe just a cup of coffee
before I propose.

549
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:06,005
Maybe two.

550
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:14,305
<i>You lads are out of this world.</i>

551

<i>David freaking Bowie?</i>

552
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:20,687
- You're a Smell fan?
- They're something else.

553
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:23,273
Wait. I gotta...
I gotta let you in on a little secret,

554
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:25,066
all right, David freaking Bowie?

555
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,401
Because tonight...

556
00:25:26,526 --> 00:25:31,906
Tonight, I am going
to propose to my girlfriend. Ah!

557
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:35,201
Okay. Yes, yes, yes.

558
00:25:36,077 --> 00:25:38,455
Okay. Well, girl, at least
you stand a fighting chance

559
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:40,040
of getting through the door now-ish.

560
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:41,499
[Nate's stomach rumbling]

561
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:44,252
Are bombs
supposed to make that sound?

562
00:25:45,795 --> 00:25:48,131
That's not a bomb. That's not a bomb.

563
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:49,382
- [Zari] Ew!
- [Nate] Ooh!

564

intestines of Play-Doh.

[panting]

[hoarsely] Bring this to the bathroom.

568
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:00,143
I'll need it in 90 seconds.

569
00:26:00,435 --> 00:26:02,312
- No.
- Who are you?

570
00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:05,190
I'm Nate from the timeline
you're currently creating

571

with that blonde bomb again.

Why are you wearing my coat?

Shh. Let it happen.

574
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:11,946
Because of your stupid plan,
this bomb drops the aliens

575
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,698
in New York during the Gilded Age.

They take over Wall Street.

John, you're poisoned
by a califax in the trading pit.

- [loudly] What about her?

and come back and grab her.

I'm really gonna miss you guys.

Get out of here.

00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:11,589
Go and enjoy your vacations.
You've earnt it.

[515 Nate] Whoo!

597
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:14,134
Vacation.

Sara, listen to me.

602
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:22,850
When you...

603
00:27:28,606 --> 00:27:31,985
No!

604
00:27:32,986 --> 00:27:35,655
Ugh! Those idiots are trying to save me.

605
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:38,324
They'll destroy the timeline
if I don't get back there soon.

606
00:27:38,408 --> 00:27:39,993
[sighs] I'm almost done.

607
00:27:40,118 --> 00:27:41,911
What will you do after we print?

608
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:47,625
Human me will go home,
and then this me will stay here.

609
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:48,917
You sure you want...

610
00:27:51,462 --> 00:27:53,715
[sighs] All right.
How long is this gonna take?

611
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,051
With these new specifications,
ten minutes.

612
00:28:00,138 --> 00:28:03,141
Well, let's just hope Rory and Gary
don't get too antsy.

- [Mick] Sara.
- [trooper Ava groaning]

Well, well,
look who I underestimated.

615
00:28:13,067 --> 00:28:14,067
Where's Sara?

616
00:28:14,068 --> 00:28:16,946
I can arrange for you
to see her most expeditiously.

that's much better.</i>

No, no, no. You ruined everything.

620
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:31,794
He's a psychopath.
Now, he's a dead psychopath.

621

He's not dead. He's everywhere.

622
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:38,551
Sara definitely picked the right Ava.
The rest of you are nuts.

Damn it. It doesn't matter.

626
00:28:47,477 --> 00:28:50,605
You won't have time to reprint
before I blow this place up.

[Bishop clicks tongue]
<i>You're thinking too small again, Sara.</i>

[gasps]

631
00:28:59,656 --> 00:29:03,243
Oh, no. His consciousness is digital,
and he's uploading it to the cloud.

632
00:29:03,326 --> 00:29:05,620
Once that upload's complete,
he can print himself

633
00:29:05,703 --> 00:29:07,503
- from anywhere...
- Anywhere in the universe.

634
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,499
- Exactly.
- All right, so we stop it.

635
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:12,585
The only way to do that
is to detonate the generators.

636
00:29:14,879 --> 00:29:16,339
[Sara] How long until he's uploaded?

637
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:17,882
Three minutes.

638
00:29:19,926 --> 00:29:21,206
[Bishop] <i>What will you do, Sara,</i>

639
00:29:21,344 --> 00:29:23,805
<i>save yourself or stop me?</i>

00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,266
<i>What a sticky little wicket.</i>

641
00:29:31,271 --> 00:29:33,189
[Sara] Can't this thing
print any faster?

642

- Shut up.

What is that?

646
00:29:51,749 --> 00:29:52,749
[sighs]

647
00:29:52,792 --> 00:29:53,918
It's me.

648
00:29:54,043 --> 00:29:55,336
What?

649
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,171
- I died.
- Again?

650
00:29:57,463 --> 00:30:00,883
Yeah. But this time,
I didn't make it back.

651
00:30:01,426 --> 00:30:03,594
- So, who am I talking to?
- A monster.

652
00:30:03,886 --> 00:30:05,888
Which is why you need to make sure

653
00:30:05,972 --> 00:30:08,891
that you take this version of me
home with you, all right?

654
00:30:08,975 --> 00:30:10,518
This body, it's not me.

655
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:13,730
Uh, one minute until
Bishop's upload is complete.

656
00:30:13,938 --> 00:30:16,316
- Then blow it.
- No, don't, don't.

657
00:30:16,774 --> 00:30:19,402
I can't go back
to the team half-alien.

658
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:22,071
What if I hurt you guys,
what if I hurt Ava?

659
00:30:22,155 --> 00:30:23,781
Listen, that creep can't get away.

660
00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:26,284
That creep changed me, Rory.

661
00:30:26,534 --> 00:30:29,537
Look, I don't even know
what I am anymore, all right?

662
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:32,582
You cannot see it, but I'm damaged.

663
00:30:33,708 --> 00:30:34,708
Damaged?

664
00:30:35,001 --> 00:30:37,712
No, I see someone
who has been through hell,

665
00:30:37,795 --> 00:30:39,380
but never stopped being herself.

666
00:30:40,006 --> 00:30:41,341
I see Captain Lance.

667
00:30:42,592 --> 00:30:45,303
I see Sara, my oldest friend.

668
00:30:47,347 --> 00:30:48,598
We need you.

669
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:53,227
Please.

670
00:30:53,811 --> 00:30:54,811
[sighs]

671
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,606
Let's get out of here.

672
00:30:56,898 --> 00:30:58,149
[Mick] Hmm.

673
00:30:58,232 --> 00:30:59,232
Come on.

674
00:31:00,318 --> 00:31:03,821
Gary, let's blow this place.

675
00:31:24,425 --> 00:31:27,595
[Bishop] <i>No!</i>

676
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,180
[Gary] Whoo!

677
00:31:29,263 --> 00:31:31,766
We did it! <i>Viva la Avalucion!</i>

678
00:31:31,974 --> 00:31:32,974
Let's move.

679
00:31:35,019 --> 00:31:36,562
Okay. So, once the barrier's gone,

680
00:31:36,646 --> 00:31:38,564
it'll be cold
and you'll need masks to breathe.

681
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,817
You'll need these
to fend off the Zagurons.

682
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,528
They hate light. Okay. Good luck

683
00:31:43,903 --> 00:31:45,029
You sure you won't come?

684
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,073
This is my home.

685
00:31:49,075 --> 00:31:50,451
Are you gonna be okay?

686
00:31:51,035 --> 00:31:54,539
We're a team of trained warriors,
medics, engineers and gourmet chefs.

687
00:31:54,622 --> 00:31:55,873
We'll be fine.

688
00:31:56,374 --> 00:31:57,458
[distant roaring]

689
00:31:57,542 --> 00:31:59,961
[trooper Ava] The Zagurons
have broken past the barrier.

690
00:32:00,044 --> 00:32:01,546
We gotta go.

691
00:32:10,221 --> 00:32:12,640
Mick, you out there?

692
00:32:12,932 --> 00:32:14,725
[Zaguron roaring]

693
00:32:18,354 --> 00:32:21,315
- [Gary] The third moon has set.
- [Mick] She'll wait.

694
00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:23,109
[Sara] How can you be so sure?

695
00:32:23,192 --> 00:32:26,279
[Mick] I just am.
Kayla wouldn't leave without me.

696
00:32:26,362 --> 00:32:28,072
[thunder crashing]

697
00:32:31,367 --> 00:32:32,493
[Sara] Where's the ship?

698
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,038
[Gary] Don't take it personally, Mick.

699
00:32:36,122 --> 00:32:37,122
[growling]

700
00:32:38,833 --> 00:32:39,876
[growling]

701
00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:42,670
[Gary yells in fright]

702
00:32:47,592 --> 00:32:48,592
[Sara] Let's move.

703
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:50,428
[Gary] Ah! Let's go, go, go, go!

704
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:54,765
[Zagurons screeching]

705
00:33:19,749 --> 00:33:21,751
[Mick] She came back for me.

706
00:33:22,293 --> 00:33:24,629
[Sara] Well, I guess
you were right about Kayla.

707
00:33:25,713 --> 00:33:29,133
[Kayla] Those dirt rats were starting
to scratch off the finish,

708
00:33:29,217 --> 00:33:30,885
so I had to get
my ship off the ground.

709
00:33:31,427 --> 00:33:32,470
[Sara] You're Kayla?

710
00:33:33,012 --> 00:33:35,532
[Kayla] And you're still the woman
who almost destroyed my ship.

711
00:33:35,723 --> 00:33:39,185
If we're done standing around,
let's get off this stinking planet.

712
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:42,210
- [Mick grunts]
- [Zaguron screeches]

713
00:33:42,813 --> 00:33:44,023
[Gary] Whoa!

714
00:33:54,283 --> 00:33:55,910
[screeches]

715
00:34:05,753 --> 00:34:07,380
[Mick] Kayla!

716
00:34:10,216 --> 00:34:11,884
[Sara] Help! Help!

717
00:34:11,968 --> 00:34:12,968
[Gary] Mick!

718
00:34:25,022 --> 00:34:27,233
[Gary] Yeah, Sara!

719
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,318
[Mick] Kayla!

720
00:34:29,902 --> 00:34:31,362
Kayla!

721
00:34:31,779 --> 00:34:34,490
[Sara] Mick.
Get Kayla's ship ready to go.

722
00:34:34,574 --> 00:34:36,701
- [Gary] On it.
- [Sara] Mick, we gotta go.

723
00:34:36,784 --> 00:34:40,288
- [Mick] I'm not leaving without her.
- [Sara] We'll wait inside the ship.

724
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:58,055
Guys, we've got incoming.

725
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:08,774
Gary, get this bird in the air.

726
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:10,359
Aye-aye, Captain.

727
00:35:19,744 --> 00:35:21,287
[Zagurons screeching]

728
00:35:36,177 --> 00:35:37,678
[indistinct chatter]

729
00:35:38,429 --> 00:35:39,722
Are you okay?

730
00:35:41,724 --> 00:35:44,810
It's my fault. I got Sara abducted.

731
00:35:46,896 --> 00:35:50,149
If I'd never tried to warn her,
she just would have kept walking.

732
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:52,902
Never would have been
sucked up into space.

733
00:35:53,194 --> 00:35:55,363
I'm sure they would have
gotten her elsewhere,

734
00:35:55,446 --> 00:35:58,074
but, all right, you convinced me.
It's all your fault.

735
00:35:59,367 --> 00:36:01,494
You have
an unorthodox comforting style.

736
00:36:02,036 --> 00:36:05,748
Yeah, we didn't really do a lot
of comforting where I grew up.

737
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:09,126
Look, if you hadn't
tried to save her,

738
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:11,295
you'd have spent
the rest of your life wondering,

739
00:36:11,379 --> 00:36:12,588
"What if I had?"

740
00:36:15,091 --> 00:36:16,133
I should know.

741
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:19,303
You still miss her, your mom?

742
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:21,971
Every day.

743
00:36:22,723 --> 00:36:27,186
But losing her brought me here,
and that's not all bad.

744
00:36:27,937 --> 00:36:29,939
I'd say it's pretty good.

745
00:36:32,108 --> 00:36:33,651
[Zari] Hey, you two.

746
00:36:35,528 --> 00:36:38,406
- I'm sorry, Behrad-<i>jaan.</i>
- I learned the hard way, mate.

747
00:36:41,117 --> 00:36:42,451
Some things can't be changed.

748
00:36:44,829 --> 00:36:47,039
I'm still here.
I'm guessing the plan didn't work.

749
00:36:47,456 --> 00:36:49,583
Well, there's one silver lining.

750
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,585
I just can't believe she's gone.

751
00:36:52,044 --> 00:36:53,838
Legends never die.

752
00:36:55,423 --> 00:36:56,799
I could use a drink.

753
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:58,592
I'll second that, love.

754
00:36:59,009 --> 00:37:01,095
<i>I gotta let you in
on a little secret,</i>

755
00:37:01,178 --> 00:37:04,515
<i>all right, David freaking Bowie?
'Cause tonight, tonight,</i>

756
00:37:04,598 --> 00:37:08,811
<i>I am going to propose
to my girlfriend. Ah!</i>

757
00:37:09,603 --> 00:37:11,188
<i>I am going to propose
to my girlfriend.</i>

758
00:37:11,313 --> 00:37:12,523
Gideon, what's happening?

759
00:37:12,606 --> 00:37:14,316
[Gideon] My apologies, Captain Sharpe.

760
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,193
It appears
the file has been corrupted.

761
00:37:16,485 --> 00:37:18,779
Come on. This can't be happening.

762
00:37:19,363 --> 00:37:20,363
God.

763
00:37:20,698 --> 00:37:21,907
[sighs]

764
00:37:21,991 --> 00:37:22,991
[Sara] Ava.

765
00:37:27,455 --> 00:37:28,455
It's really you?

766
00:37:31,292 --> 00:37:33,294
[sighs] Yeah, babe, it's me.

767
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,299
I don't want to turn around,

768
00:37:38,382 --> 00:37:40,426
because I'm afraid if I do,
you'll disappear.

769
00:37:51,812 --> 00:37:54,565
I'm not going anywhere ever again,
I promise.

770
00:37:54,648 --> 00:37:56,108
Oh, my God.

771
00:38:05,826 --> 00:38:07,077
Are you okay?

772
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:11,332
I am now.

773
00:38:12,082 --> 00:38:13,709
I can't believe this.

774
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,678
- Ava will want to know I'm okay, too.
- No, she won't.

775
00:38:26,806 --> 00:38:28,808
[both sigh]

776
00:38:28,891 --> 00:38:30,976
Do the rest of the Legends
know you're here?

777
00:38:31,185 --> 00:38:32,520
[Sara] Hmm.

778
00:38:32,603 --> 00:38:36,607
Now that you've mentioned it,
it was eerily quiet.

779
00:38:38,108 --> 00:38:39,735
Maybe they went to John's.

780
00:38:40,694 --> 00:38:41,695
Oh.

781
00:38:41,779 --> 00:38:45,324
Nope. I know exactly where they went.

782
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:47,827
Tonight, we talk the best
of Sara Lance.

783
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:49,245
Yep.

784
00:38:50,037 --> 00:38:53,499
The tallest tales.
It's time to write the Legend.

785
00:38:53,582 --> 00:38:55,125
Who wants to go first?

786
00:38:55,459 --> 00:38:57,795
Hey, I will.

787
00:38:58,128 --> 00:38:59,380
[all gasp]

788
00:38:59,463 --> 00:39:01,340
- Yes!
- [laughing]

789
00:39:01,423 --> 00:39:02,883
I knew it in my bones.

790
00:39:02,967 --> 00:39:05,386
[Zari] Oh, my God. Is this really real?

791
00:39:05,886 --> 00:39:07,930
Oh, my God. I missed your hair.

792
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,766
Oh, Mick, you salty, bloody bastard.

793
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:13,185
I can't believe you did it.
You saved her. Well done.

794
00:39:13,269 --> 00:39:15,563
I'm so proud of you.
I never lost faith. [grunts]

795
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,690
Oh, look who it is.

796
00:39:17,773 --> 00:39:20,192
Alien Gary, who kidnapped Sara.

797
00:39:20,776 --> 00:39:22,528
No, I can explain that. That's not...

798
00:39:22,611 --> 00:39:25,531
He didn't kidnap me, he saved me.

799
00:39:27,908 --> 00:39:30,202
Be honest.
Rory flew up to the planet,

800
00:39:30,286 --> 00:39:32,037
but it was really me
that saved you, right?

801
00:39:32,121 --> 00:39:33,706
Yeah, B.
Let's, uh, go with that one.

802
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:35,642
[Agent Sharpe] All right, you guys.
What do you think, huh?

803
00:39:35,666 --> 00:39:36,917
Let's go home.

804
00:39:37,001 --> 00:39:41,630
- Let's go home!
- Yes, please. Let's go. Come on.

805
00:39:44,592 --> 00:39:47,678
Tonight got me thinking,
what if I don't get my magic back?

806
00:39:48,762 --> 00:39:49,762
Okay.

807
00:39:50,347 --> 00:39:51,807
But I've still got you.

808
00:39:52,808 --> 00:39:55,811
You do.
But I know you're gonna try.

809
00:39:55,936 --> 00:39:58,647
I'll turn hell upside down, love.

810
00:39:58,981 --> 00:40:02,067
Well, it's gonna come in handy having
a superhero girlfriend then.

811
00:40:02,151 --> 00:40:04,445
Yeah. [chuckles]

812
00:40:04,528 --> 00:40:05,905
Those two sure got serious.

813
00:40:05,988 --> 00:40:08,407
I have so much to tell you
when we get back to the ship.

814
00:40:08,574 --> 00:40:11,285
- I cannot even...
- Time travel is so weird.

815
00:40:11,911 --> 00:40:14,705
And here we are again.
It's like nothing has changed,

816
00:40:14,788 --> 00:40:16,832
and yet everything's
changed at the same time.

817
00:40:16,999 --> 00:40:19,084
Yes, but tonight,
I'm not leaving you behind.

818
00:40:21,253 --> 00:40:25,341
And tonight,
I want to propose to my girlfriend.

819
00:40:28,135 --> 00:40:29,261
No.

820
00:40:30,262 --> 00:40:31,220
Oh!

821
00:40:31,221 --> 00:40:33,641
Oh, my God. It's happening.

822
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:36,560
Ava...

823
00:40:36,644 --> 00:40:37,728
Yes, I will.

824
00:40:38,812 --> 00:40:41,190
Sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm so excited. Please finish.

825
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:42,775
[Agent Sharpe giggles]

826
00:40:43,692 --> 00:40:45,152
"When I was up there in space,

827
00:40:45,444 --> 00:40:48,948
floating further and further away,
I realized something.

828
00:40:49,573 --> 00:40:52,159
No matter where I go or when I am,

829
00:40:53,285 --> 00:40:57,289
I will never be lost,
because I have you.

830
00:40:58,832 --> 00:41:02,628
You are my North Star,
you are my guiding light.

831
00:41:03,504 --> 00:41:08,133
And wherever you lead me,
that's my home."

832
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:11,136
Do I say yes now?

833
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,180
[chuckling] No, not yet.

834
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:15,557
[Agent Sharpe laughing]

835
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:20,646
Ava Sharpe...

836
00:41:23,607 --> 00:41:24,608
will you marry me?

837
00:41:32,074 --> 00:41:33,200
This is when you say it.

838
00:41:33,283 --> 00:41:35,411
Yes, yes! Yes, baby.

839
00:41:35,494 --> 00:41:38,122
[all cheering]

840
00:41:38,998 --> 00:41:42,334
[sighs] You remembered to take the bomb
out of the mannequin, right?

841
00:41:42,418 --> 00:41:43,418
[beeping]

842
00:41:53,262 --> 00:41:55,681
[all cheering,
wolf whistling and catcalling]

843
00:42:01,562 --> 00:42:03,564
