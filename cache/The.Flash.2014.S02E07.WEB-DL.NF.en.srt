I can't do it right now, all right.

00:00:18,726 --> 00:00:20,312
-Oh, yes you can, Barry.
-No, no, no.

00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:23,690
We were making so much progress.

8
00:00:23,856 --> 00:00:24,941
Yep. Six whole steps.

00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:26,401
Someone get me a Bozo button.

10
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:28,903
(CHUCKLES) Hey, give yourself some credit.
You just broke your back.

11
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:31,906
Yeah. A normal person would've been
paralyzed the rest of his life.

12
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:34,742
Hmm. How long until I'm fully healed?

13
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,704
The initial MRI I took a week ago
showed a complete dislocation

14
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:41,958
at the T-twelve to L-one interspace
of the thoracolumbar junction.

15
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:45,087
But this is the MRI I took this morning.

16
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:47,297
It's remarkable,
but you're almost completely healed.

17
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:49,507
I'm still having trouble breathing.

18
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:51,801
That's totally normal
with a spinal injury.

19
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:53,761
It should clear up soon.

20
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:57,974
JOE: We're gonna get you back
in that suit, Barr.

21
00:00:58,308 --> 00:00:59,392
Real quick. Trust me.

22
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:02,479
What are we gonna do about Zoom?

23
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:06,233
No sign of him since Cisco nailed him
with that tranq dart.

24
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:07,775
And I haven't vibed since then.

25
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:09,777
Maybe Zoom's not coming back.

26
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:11,113
HARRISON: <i>I highly doubt that.</i>

27
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,324
Which is why
I'm gonna go do something about it.

28
00:01:15,032 --> 00:01:16,326
What do you mean go do something about it?

29
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:19,621
I need access to your breach room
and your speed cannon.

30
00:01:20,037 --> 00:01:21,123
Why is that?

31
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:23,583
Because, Barry, it's time to go home.

32
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,302
So, you show up on our Earth,
you screw everything up,

33
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:37,555
and now you want to go home.
Sounds very familiar.

34
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,932
{\an8}Again, that wasn't me.

35
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,270
{\an8}I need to go take care of Zoom
once and for all

36
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,355
{\an8}before anyone else gets killed.

37
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:46,773
{\an8}How do you plan on doing that?

38
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:48,024
{\an8}I'll think of something.

39
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,067
{\an8}Ramon, if you'll escort me
to the speed cannon.

40
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:51,569
{\an8}No, no. You can't go through the breach.

41
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:53,946
{\an8}Yeah, he can.
Jay taught us how to send people.

42
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,282
{\an8}That's not what I mean.

43
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,659
{\an8}Look, if you can figure out
how to stop Zoom on your Earth,

44
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,076
{\an8}you can figure out how to do it here.

45
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:02,372
{\an8}We need you to stay here
until we defeat Zoom, Dr. Wells.

46
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:06,751
{\an8}What I need, Dr. Snow, is to return home.

47
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:10,880
{\an8}I'm gonna do that,
with or without your assistance.

48
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:17,595
{\an8}What are you doing?
If Harry wants to go, bye.

49
00:02:17,845 --> 00:02:20,014
{\an8}Look, like it or not, Cisco,
we need his help.

50
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:22,850
{\an8}I'm not sure another plan
from Wells is what we need.

51
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,020
{\an8}Yeah. I mean, the last bright idea he had
nearly got Barry killed.

52
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:27,855
{\an8}I know. But Jay's gone.

53
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:30,150
{\an8}And Dr. Wells knows Zoom
better than anyone.

54
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:33,653
{\an8}So, until Barry is back on his feet again,

55
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,739
{\an8}we need to keep Wells around
in case Zoom returns.

56
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:39,659
{\an8}Caitlin, if he doesn't want to be here,
then we're better off without him.

57
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:40,952
{\an8}Let him go.

58
00:02:41,118 --> 00:02:42,912
{\an8}I can't do that. Not yet.

That is just an alert for me.

64
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:01,180
{\an8}Oh, with who?

65
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:04,934
{\an8}With the lovely Kendra Saunders,
the barista at Jitters.

Oh, she makes a mean latte.

I think we're gonna go out for dinner,
and a movie.

maybe some breakfast.

106
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:02,635
My plan

107
00:05:04,136 --> 00:05:06,348
was to get The Flash's help
and use that help to stop Zoom.

And my plan failed.

Except to go back home

and face Zoom myself.

111
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:16,232
So, let's say you go back to your Earth
and you fight Zoom.

He will kill you.

how to close all the breaches.

00:16:36,703 --> 00:16:37,871
that's how this happened.

321
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,167

322
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,295

00:16:58,975 --> 00:17:00,061

(CHUCKLES)

334
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:46,565
That was a hell of an idea you had,
bringing Henry here.

335
00:17:48,775 --> 00:17:51,778
Well, he may not have his mother,
but he's got two amazing fathers.

336
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,448
-Seemed like he needed both.
-(BOTH CHUCKLING)

-My girl.
-Mmm.

338
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,124
So, how did Grodd become sentient?

339
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,751
A few years ago, S.T.A.R. Labs
had this contract

340
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,878
with the military to research and awaken

341
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:11,006
latent mind reading capabilities
for interrogation purposes.

342
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:13,967
And I'm guessing Grodd
was one of the test subjects.

343
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,886
Right. But then,
Dr. Wells shut down the program.

344
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,846
And we all thought it was to save Grodd

345
00:18:18,054 --> 00:18:21,308
from all the crazy
mind control experiments.

346
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:25,104
But it was really so that Dr. Wells
could use the accelerator explosion

347
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,148
to create a 1,500 pound
mind-controlling gorilla

348
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,982
that he could manipulate.

349
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:30,776
-Hmm.
-(COMPUTER WHIRRS)

350
00:18:31,818 --> 00:18:32,903
What kind of algorithm is that?

351
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,906
It's an algorithm meant
to extrapolate Grodd's location

352
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,741
from places we know he's already been.

353
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:43,830
HARRISON: Hello.

354
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,333
And there we have it.

355
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:50,671
No spinal cord edema,
I don't see any subacute hemorrhaging,

356
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:52,714

You're all good, Barry.

00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,635

359
00:18:56,843 --> 00:18:58,304
-but you don't need it.
-(CHUCKLES)

360
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:01,640
I'm really glad you're here, Dad.

361
00:19:01,848 --> 00:19:02,933
Me too.

362
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:07,521
I tried to call, but you can't get a cell
in Granite Peak National Park. So...

363
00:19:07,854 --> 00:19:10,399
Granite Peak?
What, you went camping by yourself?

364
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:11,733
Yeah, yeah. I got a tent.

365
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,485
-I went fishing every day.
-(CHUCKLES)

366

Sometimes, you just have to slow down,

369
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,373
to get back to where you want to be.

370
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:29,793
Yeah.

-Dad...
-CISCO: <i>Hey, guys!</i>

372

I think we found them.

00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:34,673
Yeah?

374
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:38,177
Grodd has to be in one of these
three bell towers.

375
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,011
The only reason
we couldn't find them on any cameras

376
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:41,388
underneath the city before is,

377
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:42,931
'cause he upgraded from a bachelor pad

378
00:19:43,139 --> 00:19:45,100
-to a penthouse, like a baller.
-(SIGHS)

379
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,519
Okay. So, we know where he is,
we still don't know how to get her.

380
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:48,812
We got a plan for you.

381
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,105
What's the plan?

382
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,398
We use me.

00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,193
-(GRUNTS)
-(GROANS)

384
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,777
That's Harry! That's the other Wells!

385
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,070
Barry...

386
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:58,947
Let him go. Let him go.

387
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:01,825
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

388
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,410
I found another suit in the Time Vault.

389
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:04,703
I thought he was dead.

390
00:20:04,911 --> 00:20:07,122
He's dead.
This is Harrison Wells, from Earth-2.

391
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:08,665
Earth-2?

392
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:09,958
I'll explain later.

393
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,002
If we can get Harry
to convince Grodd that he's Wells,

394
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,504
that he's his father,

395
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,506
maybe we can convince him
to let Caitlin go.

396
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:21,928
I'm not gonna be able to help
if anything goes wrong.

397
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,681
That's a chance I'm willing to take.

398
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,688
Looks like we're oh-for-two
in the bell towers, huh?

399
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:35,317
I like to think of it more as now,
we know exactly where they are.

400
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,361
Okay, let's do this again.
Give me your best Wells. (SIGHS)

401
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,655
I'm not doing the Wells again, Ramon.
I told you...

402
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:42,491
Look, I just made these
anti-mind control ear buds.

403
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:45,118
They could fail, and if they do,
you're toast.

404
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,828
So, you're gonna need to nail it,
if you wanna live.

00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:03,429
Okay. Let's, let's just try it again.

make it a little more sincere.

but you're gonna have to kill me anyway.

Now, we wait.

423
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,091
So, this is what it's like.

424
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,010
Every time you go after
one of those meta-humans?

425
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,638
Uh... (SIGHS) pretty much.

426
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,682
Only Cisco and Caitlin
are normally the ones in here,

427
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:50,016
and I'm the one out there.

428
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:51,602
There's no reason you shouldn't be.

429
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:56,690
Iris showed me what happened with Zoom.

430
00:21:58,775 --> 00:21:59,818
That was hard to watch.

431
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:03,113
I can only imagine
what that must've been like for you.

432
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,870
He showed everyone in Central City that
their hero wasn't good enough to stop him.

Well, that's certainly
what it looked like.

Your body's healed, Barry.

And yet, here you are,

438
00:22:22,048 --> 00:22:23,717
feeling the shame of losing.

439
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:27,303
I can't stop him.

440
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,015
I know it, he knows it.

441
00:22:31,057 --> 00:22:33,351
And now,
everyone in this city knows it, too.

442
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:36,522
They don't believe in me anymore, Dad.

443
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:40,358
At my trial for your mother's death,
a lot of our family and friends

444
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:41,610
were in the courtroom.

445
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:45,822
They heard awful things about
what I had done to your mother.

446
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,115
It didn't matter that it wasn't true.

447
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:50,452
Every day, I could see it on their faces,
the moment

448
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,203
when I lost them,

449
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:54,748
until everybody had stopped
believing in me.

450
00:22:56,082 --> 00:22:58,168
Well, that was my reality, you know?

451
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:01,755
I was gonna serve a life sentence
for a crime I didn't commit.

452
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,965
But worse than that, every time I looked
at someone in the eye,

453
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:05,634
from that moment forward,
they've got to believe that

454
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:07,969
I had killed the woman I loved,

455
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,723
in front of our son.

456
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:20,941
So, yeah. I do know
what's it's like being destroyed.

457
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:25,696
How did you get past that?

458
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:28,657
I embraced it.

459
00:23:32,243 --> 00:23:34,455
Accepting it was the only way
that I could move forward.

460
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,832
But I knew that if I could survive that,

461
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:42,253
and learn to believe in myself again,
then I could survive anything.

462
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,467
You know what lit that belief in me,
Barry?

463
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,302
You. (CHUCKLES)

464
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:54,683
Eleven-year-old you running around,
believing in me, gave me that hope.

465
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:03,066
And now, I'm giving it back to you, Son.

466
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,986
No more monsters can take that from us.

467
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:19,457
So, one of the main differences
between ape and human brains

468
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:22,919
is the white matter and connectivity
in the brain cells.

469
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:26,422
The chemicals that
you were treated with as an infant

470
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:30,927
were meant to overcome those differences
and cause an explosive growth of both,

471
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:34,640
similar to what humans experience
in their first few years of life.

472
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:38,727
Maybe, these chemicals can be used
to duplicate that growth,

473
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:41,187
then we won't need
a particle accelerator explosion.

No, buddy. I didn't die.

You want to kill him?

Yeah.

533

This isn't Grodd's fault.

534
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:52,045
He's only like this
because Wells made him this way.

535
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:54,840
Yes, but Cait,
he kidnapped you and you could have died.

You didn't see what I saw.

537
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:58,760
Grodd's getting smarter.

538
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:00,846
He's lonely and sad.

539
00:28:01,637 --> 00:28:02,931
He wants more apes like him.

540
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:04,557
What are you saying? He wants kids?

543
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:10,772

What are you talking about?

545
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,735
When the singularity exploded

546
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,195
I discovered the breach in S.T.A.R. Labs,

547
00:28:17,528 --> 00:28:18,571
I ran a similar test,

548
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:22,743
and discovered the same thing.
51 additional breaches.

549
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:25,453
The difference being,
the breaches in Central City

550
00:28:25,661 --> 00:28:28,539
are scattered all throughout the city,
whereas their counterparts in my world,

551
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,250
most definitely are not.

552
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,542
And you know where they lead?

553
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:34,462
Well, I was in the process
of figuring all that out.

When Dr. Snow
so gallantly convinced me to stay.

But if I am correct,

556
00:28:38,674 --> 00:28:40,593
this breach is gonna get Grodd

557
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,428
as close to home
as he's ever likely to get.

00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:47,942
Dr. Allen.

643
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:50,445
Good to see you.

644
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:51,987
Cisco.

645
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,198
-Yeah, let's go.
-Take care.

646
00:33:54,865 --> 00:33:58,119
So, Dr. Wells, this place on your Earth
that we've sent Grodd,

647
00:33:58,578 --> 00:33:59,787
what is it, exactly?

648
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:06,586
It's a refuge where gorillas subjected
to lab experiments, like Grodd,

649
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,963
(WHIRRS)

650
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:11,549
can roam freely.

651
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:16,096
I know it's for the best,
but I still feel like I betrayed him.

652
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:19,099
No, don't say that. You didn't betray him.

653
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:21,559
You gave him a better life.

654
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,271
I still don't understand, though. I...

655
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:30,110
Why do the breaches on our Earth
lead to different places on yours?

656
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:31,944
I don't know yet,

657
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,114
Ramon.

658
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,865
But I do know we have to close them all.

659
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:37,617
And I don't know how to do that.

660
00:34:37,908 --> 00:34:41,079
You don't have to do it alone anymore.
Any of it.

661
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,789
Together, we defeated Grodd.

662
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:45,333
And if we stay that way,

663
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:48,794
we will figure out how to close
the breaches, get Zoom,

664
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,463
and get you your daughter back.

665
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:54,300
Thank you.

666
00:34:58,012 --> 00:35:00,931
Oh, this one is definitely a keeper.

667
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,309
(CHUCKLES) Oh, yeah.

668
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:06,271
He could've done just the standard
baking-soda-and-vinegar volcano,

669
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:07,522
but no.

670
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:10,275
Barry wanted to do a molecular structure

671
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:12,485
-of chocolate and nougat.
-(CHUCKLES)

672
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:13,778
-It's my favorite candy bar.
-(LAUGHS)

673
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:15,196
Who does that in the sixth grade?

674
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:17,240
Well, a true science nerd.

675
00:35:18,824 --> 00:35:20,826
-Like father, like son, I suppose.
-(IRIS WEST CHUCKLES)

676
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:22,120
(CHUCKLES)

677
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:23,621
All right, Dad. We should get going.

678
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:25,623
Yeah. Uh, Joe? Can I?

679
00:35:25,831 --> 00:35:26,957
-Yeah.
-Thanks.

680
00:35:28,834 --> 00:35:29,877
Iris.

681
00:35:30,085 --> 00:35:31,754
Thank you so much for reaching out to me.

682
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:33,673
I am so glad you did.

683
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,341
-Me, too.
-Mmm.

684
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:36,551
(CHUCKLES)

685
00:35:37,092 --> 00:35:38,136
Joe,

686
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:39,929
there are no words, man.

687
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:44,559
Thanks.

688
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:47,645
All right. Um, I'm gonna swing by my lab
before I come home.

689
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:50,523
Which reminds me,
Patty, she's a smart girl.

690
00:35:51,106 --> 00:35:52,317
She's not buying your whole sick story.

691
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:53,609
-FYI.
-All right.

692
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:56,737
Patty? Would this be a new girlfriend?

693
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:58,489
Uh, yeah.

694
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,032
Something like that, yeah.

695
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,202
We'll talk about it on the way
to the bus station.

696
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:03,536
Come on. (LAUGHS)

697
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:07,498
-Bye.
-HENRY: See you.

698
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:15,047
You okay?

699
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:17,258
(SIGHS)

700
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:18,634
It's embarrassing.

701
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:22,722
I love Barry like he's my own son,
but I'm reminded that he isn't.

702
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:26,392
I start to wonder
what it would've been like if, you know...

703
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:30,688
Dad, you would've been just as amazing
with your own son,

704
00:36:30,896 --> 00:36:32,190
just like you were with me and Barry.

705
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:47,622
I hear you've been spending

706
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:49,332
-a lot of time up here.
-(CHUCKLES)

707
00:36:49,915 --> 00:36:51,166
Well, you know what they say.

708
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:53,503
When the CSI's away...

709
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,256
It's good to see you on your feet again.

710
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,800
It must have been
all that canned soup you had.

711
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,678
Or maybe the homemade stuff
Joe brought you.

712
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,933
(STUTTERS) Yeah.
I wasn't actually sick, Patty.

713
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:09,935
Yeah, I figured that out. (CHUCKLES)

714
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:11,979
(SIGHS)

715
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,234
Why did you lie to me?

716
00:37:17,943 --> 00:37:20,946
My dad was in town.
I needed to spend some time with him.

717
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:23,032
You couldn't just tell me that?

718
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:28,621
You gotta understand, Patty.
My dad was convicted of murder.

719
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:31,749
When someone's image
has been tarnished like that,

720
00:37:31,957 --> 00:37:33,793
it's hard for some people to see past it.

721
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,463
And you seriously think
I'm one of those people?

722
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:39,924
No, I know.
I should've given you more credit.

723
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:42,593
No, you should've given yourself
more credit.

724
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:46,389
This isn't about your father, Barry.
This is about you.

725
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:52,270
I need to know that I can trust you,
if we're gonna do this.

726
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:55,856
Okay.

727
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:57,483
I'm serious.

728
00:37:58,984 --> 00:38:00,027
-(CHUCKLES)
-I can tell.

729
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:02,237
You cannot always be a smart ass.

730
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:03,489
Mmm.

731
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:22,717
-Hi.
-Hi.

732
00:38:25,345 --> 00:38:28,514
I didn't know if you liked
flowers or chocolate. So...

733
00:38:30,015 --> 00:38:31,058
I got you both.

734
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:33,143
Well, I'm allergic to chocolate

735
00:38:33,353 --> 00:38:35,730
and I think that flowers
are a waste of money.

736
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:38,358
Um...

737
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,318
I have lollipops in my car?

738
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:42,695
(CHUCKLES) Cisco, I'm joking.

739
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:43,946
-Oh, God.
-(LAUGHS)

740
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:46,324
This is great. Thank you.

741
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,243
Listen, I wanted to come over here

742
00:38:50,035 --> 00:38:51,245
and say I'm sorry

743
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:53,873
for bailing the other night.

744
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,417
I'm a liaison with the C.C.P.D.,

745
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:59,044
and there was an emergency
and I had to be there.

746
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,796
-The C.C.P.D.?
-Yeah.

747
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:02,923
(CHUCKLES) Wow, that's really cool.

748
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:04,800
And very brave.

749
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:06,469
Thank you.

750
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:10,640
And this is very, very sweet, Cisco.
(CHUCKLES)

751
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:12,767
Um...

752
00:39:13,183 --> 00:39:14,226
What is this?

753
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,020
-Oh, see, that right there?
-Mmm-hmm.

754
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:18,188
That's a digital movie projector.

755
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:20,858
I loaded all of <i>Princess Bride</i> on there.

756
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,068
-(CHUCKLES)
-Mmm-hmm. That's right.

757
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:25,530
So, all we need is a wall or, you know,

758
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,114
someplace where we can

759
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:29,409
pick up our date where we left off.

760
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:33,203
Well, if we're going to pick up

761
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:35,623
right where we left it...

762
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:39,710
(CHUCKLES)

763
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:54,308
Whoa.

764
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:57,269
Whoa. What? What's wrong?

765
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:03,233
Nothing.

766
00:40:04,234 --> 00:40:05,695
You're just a really amazing kisser.

767
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:08,906
(CHUCKLES)

768
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:10,866
Okay.

769
00:40:12,367 --> 00:40:14,620
Let's go watch <i>Princess Bride.</i>

770
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:17,707
-Let's.
-There's a great wall up on the roof.

771
00:40:26,131 --> 00:40:27,174
