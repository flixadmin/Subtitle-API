1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,960
<i>My name is Eobard Thawne.</i>

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,400
<i>With the help of Damien Darhk,</i>

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,760
<i>Malcolm Merlyn,
Leonard Snart, and Mick Rory,</i>

4
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,760
<i>I've obtained the Spear of Destiny...</i>

5
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,520
<i>an ancient artifact with the power</i>

6
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,200
<i>to rewrite reality itself,
and we have.</i>

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,520
<i>It's a brave new world.</i>

8
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,360
The Mayor would like a word,
Miss Smoak.

9
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,080
Then, maybe he should've
come down here himself

10
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,960
instead of sending
the bimbo brigade.

11
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,120
Rude!

12
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,720
Well done, ladies.

13
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,800
Star City owes you
a debt of gratitude.

14
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,680
Just doing our job, Mr. Mayor.

15
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,720
Yes, but you do it so well,
and with such... style.

16
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:55,120
And you've done a bang-up job
dealing with my... pest problem,

17
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,040
though that term may be
giving you vigilantes

18
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,240
a little too much credit.

19
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,480
Even a cockroach knows
when to pack up

20
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,200
and head out of Dodge.

21
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,280
Star City is my home.

22
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,640
I will never stop fighting.

23
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,720
Sure you will.

24
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,480
Kill her.

25
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,560
Get rid of that.

26
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,080
Oh, but I will take this mask...

27
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,360
so I can add it to my collection.

28
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,600
No, I will not take a seat

29
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,320
and wait for him to have an opening.

30
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,040
{\an5}He can make time for me now.
Can't you, Eobard?

31
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,520
I'm so sorry, Mr. Thawne.

32
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,840
He insisted.

33
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,480
I see your friend
is still putting up a fight.

34
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,280
{\an5}He'll give up.
All caged animals do eventually.

35
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,360
Now, tell me why you've flown
all the way out here again.

36
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,120
You keep ignoring my requests
for a meeting.

37
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,440
Because there's no reason for one.

38
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,760
Our partnership has ended.

39
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,000
You got what you wanted.

40
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,520
{\an5}Your wife and your son are both
alive and in good spirits.

41
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,560
Your daughter, Thea, adores you.

42
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,920
{\an5}Nyssa al Ghul is trapped
in a miserable, closeted life

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,480
in the middle of Ohio, and hey,

44
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,200
you can even clap again.

45
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,080
What more could you possibly want?

46
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,280
How about the Spear of Destiny?

47
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,800
There are still some things
in this world

48
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,080
that I would like to see change.

49
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,800
How many times do I
have to tell you this, Malcolm?

50
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,240
The Spear is safest in my hands.

51
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,080
{\an5}Besides, I'm the only one
who knows how to use it.

52
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,000
{\an5}That's because you destroyed
the Kalabros Manuscript.

53
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,280
Well, it's not my fault

54
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,440
{\an5}you don't retain information
like I do.

55
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,560
Speedster brains are handy that way.

56
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,320
Mr. Jackson is here to see you.

57
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,600
Send him in.

58
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,400
Good morning, Mr. Thawne.

59
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,680
Jefferson.

60
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,360
How are things down at the lab?

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,960
There was a minor setback,

62
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,880
but the situation is under control.

63
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,720
You promised me results.

64
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,920
And you will have them.

65
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,040
{\an5}I just need to motivate
my employee a little more.

66
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,960
But another test will be
up and running this evening.

67
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,320
I hope so, for his sake...

68
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,960
and yours.

69
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,160
Yes.

70
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,480
{\an5}I don't know why you and Damien
insist on toying with the Legends.

71
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,200
{\an5}It's sloppy.
They should be wiped from existence.

72
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,480
I prefer this arrangement.

73
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,440
I believe, it's called
"poetic justice."

74
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,320
And what is this project
you're working on?

75
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,160
I'm a man of science, Malcolm.

76
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,240
I'm compelled to innovate,
invent, and inspire.

77
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,240
{\an5}A genius brain needs
a genius challenge.

78
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
{\an5}Now go. Enjoy your family,
spend your wealth.

79
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,880
The world is as it should be.

80
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,680
Be satisfied with your spoils.

81
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,120
The others are having
the time of their lives.

82
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,200
Stop! Hold it right there!

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,920
Cool it, Mick.
We already got what we came for.

84
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,800
Just heating things up.

85
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,320
Don't move!
Both of you on the ground!

86
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,840
Mr. Snart. Sorry, sir.

87
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,120
We didn't realize it was you.

88
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,200
Carry on.

89
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,720
What the hell's going on?
No roasting pigs?

90
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,280
No need. We're home free, buddy.

91
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,080
It's good to be the king.

92
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,320
No getaway, no chase?

93
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,480
{\an5}You want a chase,
I can arrange a chase.

94
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,320
Even get us tossed in Iron Heights,

95
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,560
{\an5}and we can plan an escape
just like old times.

96
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,240
- How does that sound?
- Boring!

97
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,120
Well, we could hit up
the Central City Bank.

98
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,120
{\an5}They've got a fancy new vault
I've been dying to crack.

99
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,400
What's the point?

100
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,440
You own the bank and half the city.

101
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,840
You mean we own half the city, Mick.

102
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,680
We're partners, remember?

103
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,800
{\an5}Seems our next score
will have to wait.

104
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,400
Thawne is...

105
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,680
summoning us.

106
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,640
Since when do we get summoned?

107
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,120
{\an5}Since the man agreed not to erase
you and your friends from existence.

108
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,760
Gideon, I've finally perfected
my fondant bows.

109
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,920
What do you think?

110
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,200
{\an5}<i>Your technique has vastly improved
over the last year, Captain.</i>

111
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,680
<i>These cakes are so much
more creative than your biscuits.</i>

112
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,640
Now, credit where credit is due,
Gideon.

113
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,440
Your idea of adding more gelatin
to the mixture was pivotal.

114
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,960
<i>Well done. The best one yet,
in my humble opinion.</i>

115
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,680
{\an5}It's a shame that you're
the only one here to appreciate it.

116
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,440
{\an5}<i>I'm sure your team would be
just as impressed.</i>

117
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,080
{\an5}Assuming that they're
all still alive.

118
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,840
<i>Perhaps, you should resume
your efforts</i>

119
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,960
<i>to send a message out.</i>

120
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,720
What's the point, Gideon?

121
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,280
The Legion have the Spear of Destiny!
They're like gods now!

122
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,560
There's no point in fighting.

123
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Not anymore.

124
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,760
Stein!

125
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,480
Yes, Mr. Jackson?

126
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,960
What's this I hear about you
taking tomorrow off?

127
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,640
It's Saturday, sir,
and it's my daughter's birthday.

128
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,840
Oh. Well, of course.
Take the day off.

129
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,560
In fact, why don't you take
the whole week off?

130
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,040
Really?

131
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,120
Of course.

132
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,720
I mean, the project's ready
for Mr. Thawne to use, correct?

133
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,760
- Well, in fact...
- In fact, old man,

134
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,200
you will not be leaving this building
until Mr. Thawne sees results.

135
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,400
I have been working nonstop
for the past month.

136
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,560
I haven't seen my wife
and daughter in weeks.

137
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,600
You want to see your family?

138
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,600
Then, you will get that reactor
working by tomorrow night.

139
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,560
It's impossible.
There's too much data...

140
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,000
Get it working!

141
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,600
Or you will never see that
precious family of yours again.

142
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,240
Somebody clean this place up!
It's a damn mess.

143
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,280
I'm so sorry,
may I help you with that?

144
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,560
Oh. No worries, man. I got it.

145
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,320
Yes, Mr. President,
you know I'll be there.

146
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,280
You know I love receiving medals.

147
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,760
And then, golf on Sunday.

148
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,640
And dinner at your hotel after?

149
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:48,080
All right, all right, best to Mel.

150
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,200
Bye-bye.

151
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,960
I am so sorry. I had to take that.

152
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,560
There's only so many times
you can tell

153
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,120
the President of the United States
that you'll call him back.

154
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,240
- You want to get to the point?
- Yes.

155
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,400
I brought you here to discuss a...
sensitive matter,

156
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,440
and it goes by the name
of Malcolm Merlyn.

157
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,120
What about him?

158
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,760
Want you to keep an eye
on him for me.

159
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,880
We're not your watchdogs.

160
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,080
What was that?

161
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,840
What he meant was, we're not spies.
We're thieves.

162
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,840
Mr. Thawne, I need to speak with you!

163
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,560
I just need five minutes
of your time.

164
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,640
Please.

165
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,480
Reality's at stake.
The world isn't right.

166
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,960
Okay, let him go. Let him go.

167
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,880
Let's just, let's see
what he has to say.

168
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,640
It's okay.

169
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,040
He intentionally hit me in the ribs.

170
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,120
First of all, awesome office.

171
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,920
I guess it pays to be
the smartest man in the world,

172
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,720
which is why
I've come to you for help.

173
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,840
You were saying that
the world isn't right.

174
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,920
Yeah, this world we're in now
is wrong.

175
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,560
Reality has... has changed somehow.

176
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,520
How do you know all this?

177
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,800
Well, there's signs everywhere
if you know where to look.

178
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:07,320
There's subtle inconsistencies
in the fabric... of reality.

179
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,920
I call them scars.

180
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,080
You know, like,
after you've been operated on.

181
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,680
Well, reality has been operated on.

182
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,680
Truly fascinating.

183
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm giddy with excitement.

184
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,480
What's that got to do with him?

185
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,720
Well, Mr. Thawne could help me
fix it.

186
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,920
Look, right, you're a genius.

187
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,640
You figured out cold fusion.
You saved the polar bears,

188
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,400
you fixed global warming.

189
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,240
I mean, you made desalination
sustainable.

190
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,680
I mean, you solve problems
like this, like, every day.

191
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,760
If anyone, anyone can figure out
why these scars exist

192
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,760
and how to put the world
back to the way it was...

193
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,600
it's you, dude.

194
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,880
You know what?

195
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,200
I think you're on to something.

196
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,720
Something is definitely
not right here.

197
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,280
Fix it. Take mister...

198
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,520
- Heywood.
- Mr. Heywood.

199
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,320
Take Mr. Heywood out
for some fresh air.

200
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,640
And kill him.

201
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,600
Me?

202
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,920
Look, I don't understand.

203
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,920
If this is about my work,
nobody pays attention to it.

204
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,960
My mom's the only person
that reads my blog.

205
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,160
Stop talking.

206
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,280
Guys, I am not a threat to anyone...

207
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,880
unless I'm right.

208
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,760
Am I right?

209
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,560
Sounds like fitting final words
to me.

210
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,520
Whatever...

211
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,840
science or magic altered
reality must have left

212
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,920
small scars on my memory
that my subconscious picked up on.

213
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,720
So, if I'm not a conspiracy theorist
no one listens to, then...

214
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,240
Who am I?

215
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,440
- Dead.
- Wait.

216
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,520
- What?
- He said, "Wait."

217
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,920
I heard him. He said, "Wait."

218
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,440
You promised me things were
gonna be like old times.

219
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,200
It is like old times, only better.

220
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,400
Central City is ours. No more Flash.

221
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,840
Except another speedster's
calling the shots.

222
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,200
You leave Thawne to me.

223
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,480
I always have a plan.
You know this.

224
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,760
Well, fill me in.

225
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,320
When the time is right.

226
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,360
Ah, yes, we're partners,

227
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,160
except when you refuse
to tell me what's going on.

228
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,440
You son of a...

229
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,080
Sorry, buddy. I owed you that.

230
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,000
You saved my life. Why?

231
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,840
Because I'm an idiot.

232
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,680
This could be
one of my scars talking,

233
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,160
but I'm sensing you're
telling me the truth.

234
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,640
Let's move.

235
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,040
Okay.

236
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,960
This is crazier than any
of my crazy theories.

237
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,280
You're trying to tell me a group
called "The Legion of Doom"

238
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,640
used something called
"The Spear of Destiny"

239
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,200
to rewrite reality?

240
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,520
Who even names something
"Legion of Doom"?

241
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,320
- You did.
- Me?

242
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,000
Now, do you only remember
the old reality

243
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,320
because you're part of the Legion?

244
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,960
I'm not part of anything.

245
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,640
I just made a terrible mistake.

246
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,480
You filthy aliens.

247
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,800
Come on, wait a minute.

248
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,560
This is the guy who's gonna
fix reality?

249
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,640
Who are you guys,
and what are you doing here?

250
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,880
We need your help.

251
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,480
What do you got, like,
a clogged toilet or something?

252
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,000
'Cause, you know,
I'm... I'm off duty now.

253
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,280
You're not a janitor.

254
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,000
Yeah, I am, man.
It says so on my name...

255
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,800
on my name tag.

256
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,680
You're a geek, a nerd, a genius.

257
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,000
That's why we're here.

258
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,960
Oh, is this
about the dipole magnets

259
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,280
that I borrowed from S.T.A.R. Labs?

260
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,440
'Cause I'm totally gonna
return those.

261
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,600
Look, man,

262
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,200
he said you're the one
that could fix this reality.

263
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,480
Fix this reality?

264
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,320
What do you mean?

265
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,400
You guys think there's
something wrong too?

266
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,240
- Whoa.
- Oh!

267
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,000
That's... that's private stuff, man.

268
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,920
- What is it?
- I don't know exactly.

269
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,760
I mean... I mean,
I think I know, but I don't...

270
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,320
Spit it out, haircut.

271
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,240
Well, I ki...

272
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,800
I kind of built it on impulse.

273
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,680
You know, like, on instinct.

274
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,240
I call it,
a Transreality Multiplexer.

275
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,800
No real reason.
Just thought it sounded cool.

276
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,960
Don't you get it, man?

277
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,320
Your impulse was a reality scar
working on your subconscious.

278
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,400
Reality scar.

279
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,640
So, what does this fun gun do?

280
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,280
Theoretically,

281
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,160
it targets irregularities
in the hippocampus,

282
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,160
acting like a "Control-Z"
for memories.

283
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,480
"Control-Z"?

284
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,480
Like an undo command
on a computer.

285
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,520
Well, I was gonna try the new version
on my latest test subject,

286
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,640
but then I was worried
it might melt his brain.

287
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,240
- Axel.
- No, it's Tesla, actually.

288
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,000
He looks more like an Indiana to me.

289
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,000
No, he's Axel.

290
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,080
You gave me that little guy
for Christmas.

291
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,160
You haven't been running
any tests on him, have you?

292
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,360
What? No.

293
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,280
Whoa. Whoa! No, no! No!

294
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,640
All right, I think actually for it
to work

295
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,240
you have to shoot him in the head.

296
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,600
Why would you say that?

297
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,920
Hey, how many people
are gonna point guns at me today?

298
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,840
Oh, my God, you killed him!

299
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,000
You son of a gun.

300
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,200
It works.

301
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,640
So, Mr. Rory's having
second thoughts?

302
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,840
Mick's just a little confused.
I can control him.

303
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,280
- Obviously you can't.
- Yes, I can.

304
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,200
I just need your help getting
him back on the reservation,

305
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,280
before Thawne finds out.

306
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,920
We have bigger problems.

307
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,080
What if Heywood's only the first
of his old teammates

308
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,560
Mr. Rory's feeling nostalgic for?

309
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,640
I knew we should've killed them all.

310
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,360
It was a dangerous oversight
to keep them alive in any capacity.

311
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,880
Does that include Mick?

312
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,400
At the very least
we should've wiped his brain,

313
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,680
such as it is.

314
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,480
You trusted your buddy
a little too much.

315
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,200
Calm yourself, Malcolm.

316
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,160
We'll have Mr. Rory back
before he does too much damage.

317
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,920
Yes, boss?

318
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,320
Mick Rory's got himself lost.

319
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,680
Find him, would you?

320
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,440
Where do you suggest
we start our search?

321
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,040
You can track him with this.

322
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,360
I put a GPS in Mick.

323
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,640
I don't trust anyone.

324
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,440
Okay, on the count of three.

325
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,520
One...

326
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,120
two...

327
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,680
You!

328
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,880
I deserved that.

329
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,560
Damn straight you did.

330
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,520
Hey, if it wasn't for me,
you'd all be dead.

331
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,600
Yeah, Mick, thanks a lot.

332
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,520
You trapped each of us
in our own personal hell.

333
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,880
Do you have any idea
how many toilets I've cleaned?

334
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,440
So many.

335
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,760
Amaya.

336
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,840
Sara.

337
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,360
Hey, dumbasses,

338
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,400
they have no clue who you are.

339
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,120
They work for Damien Darhk.

340
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,040
Crap.

341
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,240
I don't like the way
she's looking at us.

342
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,520
I like the way
she's looking at us.

343
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,000
Love the suits.

344
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,800
Get off my friend!

345
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,280
All right guys, time out, come on.
Come on, look.

346
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,440
I know this may sound crazy,
but doesn't it seem

347
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,120
like there's something wrong
with this world?

348
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,760
Yeah. Rory sold out the boss.

349
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,680
To throw in with you losers.

350
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,920
Losers? I'll have you know
in my reality,

351
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,600
you and I had sex,
and we both liked it very much.

352
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,840
Nate, not helping.

353
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,960
Amaya, look at me.

354
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,920
Tell me you don't recognize me,
like, deep in your subconscious.

355
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,560
Come, look, this isn't
how it's supposed to be.

356
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,080
Okay, you're supposed to be
heroes like us.

357
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,800
Okay. Allow me...

358
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,120
to demonstrate my superpowers.

359
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,200
Okay?

360
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,120
Knock it off, you idiot.

361
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,120
The Spear took away your powers.

362
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,200
But it's true.
Nate used to be able to steel up,

363
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,800
and I had a robotic exoskeleton
that allowed me to shrink.

364
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,160
These guys are heroes.

365
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,120
That is so great.

366
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,120
We kill heroes.

367
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,080
One more person hits me,
I'm gonna punch back.

368
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,920
What the hell happened to me?

369
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,040
It appears that after the Legion
got the Spear and changed reality,

370
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,360
they kept us around as their pets.

371
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,000
Yeah, except for you.

372
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,600
You helped the Legion
steal the Spear!

373
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,800
Speaking of, the Legion's probably
on their way here to kill us.

374
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,880
We need to get out of here.

375
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,960
Yeah.
Gotta find someplace to hide.

376
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,960
Your mom's basement?

377
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,400
Really?

378
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,680
I pay rent, so legally
it's my basement, kind of.

379
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,760
Mommy makes great sandwiches.

380
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,480
The best. It's the perfect amount

381
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,400
of mayo-meat-bread ratio
that really gives it...

382
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,920
Focus! We need to figure out

383
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,840
how we can rescue
the rest of the team,

384
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,640
and get the Spear back
so we can undo

385
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,000
everything the Legion has done.

386
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,440
Except now they know we're trying
to get the band back together.

387
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,360
Except they don't know
that you've gotten to me,

388
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,560
- which means..
- You can sneak into the Legion

389
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,600
and pretend to be
Darhk's favorite chick.

390
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,800
It's our best shot
at getting Amaya back.

391
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,560
All right.
What about the rest of the team?

392
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,160
Well, the Professor and Jax
are working

393
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,240
on some secret project for Thawne.

394
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,960
I don't know where the Englishman is.

395
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,520
Neither do it.

396
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,800
I can only imagine
how those psychopaths

397
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,960
are torturing Rip.

398
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,680
Gideon! I've discovered
the missing ingredient for my recipe.

399
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,040
Rum.

400
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,720
And speaking of which,
I'm gonna need you

401
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,680
to fabricate me another bottle of it.

402
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,160
Ooh, and some nachos.

403
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,760
<i>I will do nothing of the sort.</i>

404
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,840
What?

405
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,360
You will do as I tell you,
Gideon, I'm your captain!

406
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,960
<i>Then, it's time for you
to start acting like one.</i>

407
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,880
<i>Now, sit up straight and show
your backbone, Captain Hunter.</i>

408
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,200
Gideon, for the thousandth time,

409
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,720
I've got no way of getting
the reserve power back online,

410
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,160
and I've got no way of...

411
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,080
of sending out
any signal of any sort,

412
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,480
which means...

413
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:35,720
which means that I am destined
to live out the rest of my days

414
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,440
right here...

415
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,120
with you.

416
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,560
<i>While you were honing
your confectionary skills,</i>

417
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,160
<i>I've been working on new algorithms</i>

418
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,720
<i>to redirect power
from the idle quadrants of the ship.</i>

419
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,000
<i>You need to focus on boosting
your distress signal</i>

420
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,080
<i>once power is fully back online.</i>

421
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,680
<i>Now, chin up, Captain.</i>

422
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,800
I don't know if I can do this,
Gideon.

423
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,080
<i>I believe in you.</i>

424
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,840
<i>Now, let's get to work.</i>

425
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,720
First...

426
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,680
I'm going to vomit.

427
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,560
And second...

428
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,680
let's do this.

429
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,680
When your minions bring Mick back,

430
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,960
I want to arrange
a meeting with Thawne.

431
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,040
When I say "arrange
a meeting," I mean...

432
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,800
One between Thawne and his maker?

433
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,200
Cute. A little mustache-twirly
for my taste.

434
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,320
You're really gonna have
to step up your tactics, Leonard.

435
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,520
Yeah, you didn't think
that Thawne was

436
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,440
actually gonna fall
for that fake meeting trick?

437
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,960
This is not "The Godfather."

438
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,520
Although we do agree
with your sentiment.

439
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,960
Eobard has to go.

440
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,800
So glad you both approve.

441
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,400
Which brings us back
to our original conundrum.

442
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,360
How to kill a speedster.

443
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,760
We found your partner,

444
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,360
and he's got himself some friends.

445
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,640
And where, pray tell,
is your partner, Miss Lance?

446
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,360
We got separated in the fight.

447
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,240
I haven't heard from her since,
so I'm guessing she's dead by now.

448
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,560
That's the thing about Sara Lance,
she never stays dead for very long.

449
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,760
Sorry, we underestimated them.

450
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,840
Won't happen again. We'll fix this.

451
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:16,520
- Let's go.
- Oh... not so fast.

452
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,840
Yes?

453
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,840
I have a question for you.

454
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,160
Which one is your favorite trophy?

455
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,760
That's like asking a girl
to pick just one pair of shoes.

456
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,400
Oh, please, everyone
has their favorite kill.

457
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,640
You want to hear mine?

458
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,200
Her name was Black Canary.

459
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,000
I will never forget her.

460
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,400
It was so... delicious,

461
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,040
killing her.

462
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,560
They told me that
I'd done it before,

463
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,080
but I can't imagine it
ever getting old.

464
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,480
The very first thing I did
in this reality

465
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,240
was acquire my magic.

466
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,560
I'm gonna miss you, Ms. Lance.

467
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,080
Having you around to attend
to my every whim

468
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,560
was too enticing to pass up.

469
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,480
Plus, it's so hard to find
good help these days.

470
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:21,000
Really? Now's the time
for a bad guy monologue?

471
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,440
You should've killed me
when you had the chance.

472
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,440
No better time than the present.

473
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:29,360
Amaya, the honor is yours.

474
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,960
Good-bye.

475
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,400
What the hell?

476
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,480
Shoot now. Explain later.

477
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,600
Damien, what did I tell you?

478
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,680
For what it's worth, I thought
it was a very good bad guy monologue.

479
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,200
Everything's on schedule, Mr. Thawne.

480
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,880
You have nothing to worry about.

481
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,520
Hey.

482
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,280
What do you want?

483
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,560
There's just one thing
I don't understand.

484
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,720
If Thawne made this world
to punish us,

485
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,320
how are your mom's sandwiches
so good, bro?

486
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,080
Her condiment game's on point, right?

487
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,440
She even had
gluten-free bread for me.

488
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,840
Look, let's just get
back to the ship.

489
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,360
We don't know where the ship is,

490
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,080
or Rip, which means our next move

491
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,600
should be to rescue the Professor.

492
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,560
Speaking of which, what did
Thawne have you two working on?

493
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,520
Grey did most of the work, and...

494
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,960
I just made his life hell.

495
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:40,520
But from what I could tell,
he was building some sort of reactor.

496
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,200
He said it would burn
a thousand times hotter

497
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,720
than the sun once it's operational.

498
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,960
I like the sound of that.

499
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,560
Could be a power generator,
a particle accelerator.

500
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,320
What if Thawne is trying
to destroy the Spear?

501
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,320
Impossible. You need the blood
of Christ to destroy it.

502
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,200
That's why Rip
broke it up into so many pieces.

503
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,200
Unless he figured out there's
another way, by incinerating it.

504
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,560
But why would Thawne want
to destroy the Spear?

505
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,560
Oh, no.

506
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,040
If he destroys the Spear,

507
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:09,480
that means this reality
cannot be rewritten.

508
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,480
Okay, we better get that Spear
before he can make that happen.

509
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,640
But even if we find it,

510
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,440
we don't know
how to access its powers.

511
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,800
Rory does. You were there, right,
when they used the Spear?

512
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,240
They read out of some book
called the "Calibrick."

513
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,640
"Cal"... "Caliber."

514
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,640
"Kalablow." "Kalabalos."

515
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,240
Something like that.

516
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,200
Do you remember
what language it was in?

517
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,360
Aramaic.

518
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,320
Dude, how do you even know
what Aramaic sounds like?

519
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,720
"Passion of the Christ."
Good movie.

520
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,360
Mick, would you be able
to recognize the incantation?

521
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,560
Yeah.

522
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,920
Hey. If they figure out
this incantation

523
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,480
and we get our hands on the Spear,

524
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,560
I want you to use it.

525
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,440
I should have listened to you
back in World War I.

526
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,720
If we had used the Spear
when we had the chance...

527
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,400
I might have been tempted to use it
to change my own future.

528
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,680
Now... we've got nothing to lose.

529
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,280
Oh, Marty, Marty, Marty.

530
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,280
I know you've been working
so hard on this project,

531
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,320
and I wanted to come by
and say thank you,

532
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,800
but if it doesn't come online
in the next few minutes,

533
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,600
I'll have to kill you.

534
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,120
One... one moment,
Mr. Thawne, I...

535
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,960
I just need one more moment.

536
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,600
There. There.

537
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,360
As you can see, the machine
appears to be fully functional,

538
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,760
though it may take some time

539
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,960
for the core to reach
peak temperature.

540
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,200
Well, then you'll stay until it does.

541
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,560
I was hoping to see
my family tonight.

542
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,520
Oh, no. No, no, no, you can't
leave in your moment of glory.

543
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,040
You keep monitoring the core

544
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,760
and make sure the reaction
remains stable.

545
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,400
Think we got something.

546
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,160
We pieced together a passage
from the "Kalabros."

547
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,880
A.K.A the word of God.

548
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,360
All right, Jax, it's on you

549
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,480
to restore Stein's mind
before we get to the lab.

550
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,920
We gotta destroy the reactor
before Thawne can destroy the Spear.

551
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,640
- Yeah, no doubt.
- Now, remember,

552
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,080
you guys are going in there
without your powers.

553
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,160
Don't worry. I know that place
like the back of my hand.

554
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,400
What about Mick?

555
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,720
Mick's staying here.

556
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,800
We can't trust him.

557
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,120
Not after what you've done.

558
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,960
After what I've done?

559
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,400
If it wasn't for me, you'd all
be walking around like sheep.

560
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,160
If it wasn't for you,
we never would have been

561
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,680
turned into sheep in the first place.

562
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,160
We trusted you, Mick.

563
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,840
We can't afford to make
that mistake again.

564
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,720
Let's go.

565
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,760
League of losers cut you loose?

566
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,600
Nobody cuts me loose.

567
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,360
I'm done with those people.

568
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:13,120
What do you say we burn
this city to the ground?

569
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,960
Knowing Sara, she's rallied
the team by now.

570
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,240
Those idiots aren't
whom I'm worried about.

571
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:26,400
Relax, boys.
Prodigal son has returned.

572
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,960
And he's got some news for us.

573
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,400
Isn't that right, Mick?

574
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:37,000
Our old friend Eobard has built
a device to destroy the Spear.

575
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,800
No wonder Eobard doesn't
want us using it

576
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,880
before he locks in
his own version of reality.

577
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,000
Which I assume means
erasing all of us.

578
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,840
And your pals.

579
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,360
My pals.

580
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,360
They want to steal the Spear
before the deed's done.

581
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,800
I think you can see
what I'm getting at, gentlemen.

582
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,640
The four of us are no match
for a speedster,

583
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,520
so while Thawne is fighting
the Legends...

584
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,000
We'll grab the Spear
from under both their noses.

585
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,520
Exactly.

586
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,080
The enemy of my enemy...

587
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,880
Is our opportunity.

588
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,560
The status of the machine, Doctor?

589
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,400
Please tell Mr. Thawne
I'm working as fast as I can.

590
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,720
I've powered up the reactor.
I just need to make

591
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,360
a few adjustments to the core.

592
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,840
Did you already turn it on?

593
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,800
I had specific instructions
from Mr. Thawne to do so.

594
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,800
Grey, we need to talk.

595
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,040
Grey?

596
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,680
Please, don't...

597
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,480
don't kill me, I've done everything
Mr. Thawne wanted.

598
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,960
I'm not gonna kill you.
I'm just gonna make you better.

599
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,480
Grey, what have you done?

600
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,120
If Mr. Thawne wants to kill me,
he'll have to do it himself.

601
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:58,120
Guys, we got a problem.
You gotta get here ASAP.

602
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,240
We're at the building.
Just keep him there.

603
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,800
Ray, find us the quickest way
into the lab, now.

604
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,080
Look, you gotta believe me, okay?

605
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,360
This is not the way
it's supposed to be.

606
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,760
Is this some sort of test
of my loyalty?

607
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,520
- Does Mr. Thawne even care?
- Look, this isn't about Thawne.

608
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,880
It's about you and me.

609
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,920
I assure you, my... my dedication
to Mr. Thawne

610
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,800
has never been stronger.

611
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,000
Did you just press the silent alarm?

612
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,920
What? No, it's...

613
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,800
it's a secondary radiation
sensor for the nuclear core.

614
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:33,840
Grey, you are a crappy liar
in any reality.

615
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,040
Martin.

616
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,720
I can't talk any sense into him,
and he just triggered an alarm.

617
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,440
Which means Thawne
will be here soon.

618
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,800
Or now.

619
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:51,240
Well, looks like you losers
managed to remember who you are.

620
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,480
I should've wiped you from existence
when I had the chance.

621
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:00,200
Do you have any idea
how infuriating it is

622
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,680
to know that Merlyn was right?

623
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,760
Lucky for you, I still believe
in some fates worse than death.

624
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,800
Like me destroying the Spear

625
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,000
and cementing this reality
for all time.

626
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,280
Martin.

627
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,560
The reactor is fully operational,
sir.

628
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,640
This...

629
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,600
is the only reality

630
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,720
any of you

631
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,600
will ever know.

632
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,960
We'll never give up
trying to stop you.

633
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,680
Well...

634
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,120
if it weren't
for your futile efforts,

635
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,880
this wouldn't be half so sweet.

636
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:43,560
Not so fast, speedy.
You have something we want.

637
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,640
You need a lesson in how
to share your toys, Eobard.

638
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,200
Yeah, time for us to get
a turn with the Spear.

639
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,520
And do what with it?

640
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,040
Don't you understand? I'm trying
to protect you from yourselves.

641
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,360
With the Spear destroyed...

642
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,640
Bored now.

643
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,560
Get the Spear!

644
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,800
Let go of the Spear,

645
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,440
and I won't use it to turn you
into a jockstrap.

646
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,080
Yeah!

647
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,920
Perhaps not.

648
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,960
Give it up!

649
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,080
Oh, Sara.

650
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,640
Why do we always find ourselves
in this situation?

651
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,400
'Cause you keep finding yourself
on the wrong side of history.

652
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,840
Nice work, Mick.

653
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,920
Now hand it over.

654
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,880
Mick, no.
You already gave it to him once.

655
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,720
- You know what happened.
- That was Thawne.

656
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,440
This time will be different,
big boy.

657
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,680
Don't do this, Mick.

658
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:51,040
Mick, I don't care
what anyone else thinks.

659
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,880
I still believe in you.

660
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,480
Enough!

661
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,600
Mick...

662
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,920
Hand it over.

663
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,360
Like a good boy.

664
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,440
You mean, a good dog.

665
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,600
That's all I am to you.

666
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,480
An attack dog.

667
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,040
Now, that's not true.

668
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,760
Sure, we both know you're not
the sharpest tool in the shed,

669
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:23,200
but that's why we're partners,
remember?

670
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,120
You're right.

671
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,800
I'm not a genius.

672
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:39,440
But I'm not one's dog, Leonard.
Not anymore.

673
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,440
Well...

674
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:50,400
I guess you can teach
an old dog new tricks.

675
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,320
Undo this mess.

676
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,000
I am sorry about your friend,
Mick.

677
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,880
I know you loved her to pieces.

678
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,560
No!

679
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,080
Well, if you want something
done right...

680
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,240
Well done, Leonard.

681
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,040
You bastard.

682
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,800
I'll kill you all.

683
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,000
Actually, I believe that's my line.

684
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:18,120
Now, where were we before I was
so rudely interrupted?

685
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,920
Well...

686
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,280
I guess we're done here.

687
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,960
You know the really swell thing
about the Spear being destroyed?

688
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,440
Now you can't stop us
from killing you.

689
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,360
Oh, please.
Don't insult my intelligence.

690
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,760
Even at your fastest,

691
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,720
you're moving
in slow motion to me.

692
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,880
Except they're not alone.

693
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,680
I say we go down fighting.

694
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,240
You kill one of us,
we kill all of you.

695
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,440
For Amaya.

696
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,720
Don't.

697
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,600
Even if you survive my men,
you'll never survive me,

698
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,600
not without powers or weapons.

699
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,880
And the truth is, I don't want
to see any more of you dead.

700
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,520
Not out of sentiment, of course.
No, no, quite the opposite.

701
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,080
But because it is so...

702
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,120
delicious,...

703
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,000
knowing that you'll be forced
to live your lives

704
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,560
in a reality that I...

705
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,240
well, that we created.

706
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:10,240
You will walk this world knowing
that something isn't quite right,

707
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,480
that for all your trying
you only made things worse,

708
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,880
and no one will ever believe you
when you tell them

709
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,080
about all the sacrifices you made

710
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:22,320
and how close you came
to being Legends.

711
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,480
Now, that sounds
like a fitting punishment to me.

712
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,520
What do you think, Professor Stein?

713
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,520
I don't care what you do to them,

714
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,520
as long as I never have to see
Mr. Jackson again.

715
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,280
Fair enough.

716
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,560
You're free to go.

717
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,600
You're just gonna let them walk?

718
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:48,280
Be glad I'm letting you
and your fellow traitors do the same.

719
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:52,120
And the next time any of you get
what you think is a smart idea,

720
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,160
remember this grace.

721
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,280
And the fact that I could
kill any of you

722
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,520
in the blink of an eye.

723
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,960
My mom's not gonna be cool
with that.

724
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,440
Do I look like I give a damn?

725
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,280
I can't believe that's it.

726
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,040
I refuse to believe that this is it.

727
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,960
Without the Spear, there's no way
we can undo any of this.

728
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,280
There is one way.

729
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,320
Time travel.

730
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,600
What do you mean?

731
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,600
We go back in time to 1916,

732
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,360
and we stop the Legion
from ever getting

733
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,920
the Spear of Destiny
in the first place.

734
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,400
No, we are not supposed to change
events we participated in.

735
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:40,760
And if we do, we risk
time folding in on itself.

736
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,040
Even if we weren't worried
about messing with time,

737
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,880
we can't go anywhere.

738
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,560
Or any-when.

739
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,200
We don't even know
where the Waverider is.

740
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,320
If it even exists in this reality.

741
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,800
Well, if it does, there's one person
who knows where it is.

742
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,600
We just have to find him.

743
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,800
<i>I've directed all available power</i>

744
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,000
<i>to the main navigational controls,
Captain.</i>

745
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,440
Thank you, Gideon.

746
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,320
Now, I've started
the communications protocol,

747
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,560
and if I just splice
these two wires together...

748
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,720
<i>Your distress signal
will be broadcast.</i>

749
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,880
Surely the rest of the team

750
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,640
must be out there somewhere,
listening.
