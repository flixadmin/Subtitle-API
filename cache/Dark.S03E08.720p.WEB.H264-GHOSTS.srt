1
00:01:00,944 --> 00:01:03,550
<i>Every journey has a beginning.</i>

2
00:01:12,944 --> 00:01:15,217
<i>But yours has no end.</i>

3
00:01:18,236 --> 00:01:20,550
<i>It goes on forever and ever.</i>

4
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:30,050
I'm here to finally make
your journey come to an end.

5
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:37,300
This is impossible.

6
00:01:40,694 --> 00:01:42,383
You should be dead.

7
00:01:44,444 --> 00:01:46,342
I had you killed.

8
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:50,300
You still have no idea
just how this game is played.

9
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:54,092
You want to destroy the knot,

10
00:01:55,111 --> 00:01:58,633
but every action you take
continues its existence.

11
00:01:59,944 --> 00:02:01,550
This can't be.

12
00:02:06,986 --> 00:02:08,758
I have killed it.

13
00:02:10,861 --> 00:02:14,342
I have killed the origin,
and the origin within her.

14
00:02:20,153 --> 00:02:22,175
Your world and Eve's world,

15
00:02:23,361 --> 00:02:26,008
they both should have never existed.

16
00:02:30,694 --> 00:02:34,675
You thought that the origin
lies in the bindings of both worlds.

17
00:02:35,986 --> 00:02:38,883
But in reality,
it's outside of both worlds.

18
00:02:43,278 --> 00:02:46,050
Our thinking is shaped by dualities.

19
00:02:48,028 --> 00:02:49,592
Black, white.

20
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,842
Light and shadow.

21
00:02:53,944 --> 00:02:56,258
Your world and Eve's world.

22
00:02:57,278 --> 00:02:58,967
But this is false.

23
00:03:01,153 --> 00:03:03,967
You need a third dimension
to fulfill it all.

24
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:10,425
The triqueta.

25
00:03:21,194 --> 00:03:22,383
That means...

26
00:03:24,861 --> 00:03:26,425
a third world?

27
00:03:30,403 --> 00:03:33,800
<i>The world
that gave birth to this knot.</i>

28
00:03:34,153 --> 00:03:36,342
<i>Where everything originates.</i>

29
00:03:38,694 --> 00:03:41,467
<i>Where a single mistake was made.</i>

30
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:50,842
<i>Tannhaus, in the origin world,</i>

31
00:03:51,444 --> 00:03:53,925
<i>like you, he lost someone.</i>

32
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:59,883
<i>And like you, he tried to bring
that person back from the dead.</i>

33
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:11,629
<i>But instead
he divided and destroyed his world...</i>

34
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:16,842
<i>And created our two worlds.</i>

35
00:04:40,444 --> 00:04:43,800
But there is a way to destroy the knot.

36
00:04:45,611 --> 00:04:48,383
Through preventing, in the origin world...

37
00:04:49,111 --> 00:04:52,758
the invention of travel
through space and time in the first place.

PARADISE

55
00:07:04,153 --> 00:07:07,050
I'd have liked
to have spared you all that.

56
00:07:09,778 --> 00:07:12,050
But your path has to remain unchanged.

57
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:16,717
Every step has to be taken as before.

58
00:07:18,486 --> 00:07:20,467
Up until this very moment.

59
00:07:28,611 --> 00:07:29,883
This here...

60
00:07:32,403 --> 00:07:34,383
Has this happened before?

61
00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:40,758
Your trying to destroy the origin
has happened an infinite number of times.

62
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,383
But this here, you and I...

63
00:07:46,028 --> 00:07:47,717
this is the first time.

64
00:07:51,944 --> 00:07:55,925
It's time for you to understand
how everything is really connected.

65
00:07:57,778 --> 00:08:00,342
<i>Everything you have done,</i>

66
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,217
<i>everything Eve has done,</i>

67
00:08:04,194 --> 00:08:09,133
<i>has maintained the knot for eternity,
in both worlds.</i>

68
00:08:10,278 --> 00:08:12,883
<i>You create yourself ever anew.</i>

69
00:08:13,903 --> 00:08:15,550
<i>And she creates herself.</i>

70
00:08:21,944 --> 00:08:23,508
They must die.

71
00:08:25,153 --> 00:08:29,425
They all must die,
so they can be reborn correctly.

72
00:08:36,653 --> 00:08:38,842
You carry both worlds inside you.

73
00:08:39,153 --> 00:08:40,424
What?

74
00:08:40,819 --> 00:08:42,174
Your son.

75
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:44,342
He is the origin.

76
00:08:45,028 --> 00:08:50,175
He gives everyone their lives,
alternately in the two worlds.

77
00:09:07,736 --> 00:09:09,717
He's waited a long time for you.

78
00:09:11,861 --> 00:09:14,383
And he will do so time and again.

79
00:09:26,528 --> 00:09:29,550
<i>You want to destroy your son,</i>

80
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,758
<i>and the knot along with him.</i>

81
00:09:32,153 --> 00:09:34,300
<i>Eve wants him to live.</i>

82
00:09:34,736 --> 00:09:38,092
<i>Therefore, she must maintain the knot.</i>

83
00:09:39,653 --> 00:09:41,717
<i>She can't help it.</i>

84
00:09:42,278 --> 00:09:45,842
<i>She'll do anything she can
to keep her son alive, time and again.</i>

85
00:09:48,819 --> 00:09:53,045
<i>Everything you and Eve
have done in this knot,</i>

86
00:09:53,069 --> 00:09:55,050
<i>and will do again and again,</i>

87
00:09:55,403 --> 00:09:57,342
<i>you have done out of love.</i>

88
00:10:03,194 --> 00:10:06,758
<i>And yet you have brought nothing
but pain and suffering.</i>

89
00:10:21,819 --> 00:10:26,717
If you want Jonas to live,
for them all to ever live,

90
00:10:27,986 --> 00:10:30,675
then we must do what's been done always.

91
00:10:34,486 --> 00:10:35,675
Even you.

92
00:10:46,486 --> 00:10:50,675
<i>Both of you have done
unimaginable things on your journey.</i>

93
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,879
<i>Because you can't let go</i>

94
00:10:54,903 --> 00:10:57,217
<i>of your deepest desire.</i>

95
00:11:05,486 --> 00:11:08,592
Yours ends here and now.

96
00:11:08,986 --> 00:11:10,092
What?

97
00:11:10,486 --> 00:11:15,175
You accomplished what you were sent
to this world to accomplish.

98
00:11:15,778 --> 00:11:17,879
We've accomplished nothing.

99
00:11:17,903 --> 00:11:21,420
She said we have to stop the apocalypse.
The containers in the plant...

100
00:11:21,444 --> 00:11:25,883
You will understand
everything when it's right for you to.

101
00:11:33,028 --> 00:11:36,425
<i>You have been trying
to escape what you will become.</i>

102
00:11:38,653 --> 00:11:40,550
<i>But that's impossible.</i>

103
00:11:42,528 --> 00:11:46,217
<i>You will end up facing yourselves
again and again.</i>

104
00:11:59,611 --> 00:12:01,300
Who are you?

105
00:12:02,694 --> 00:12:04,050
I'm sorry.

106
00:12:06,944 --> 00:12:10,592
Your two worlds
should have never existed.

107
00:12:11,569 --> 00:12:16,967
You and Eve should never have existed.

108
00:12:19,694 --> 00:12:21,300
How do you know all this?

109
00:12:21,694 --> 00:12:24,633
How do you know about the origin world?

110
00:12:26,736 --> 00:12:31,508
I've spent 33 years looking for answers,
in your world and hers.

111
00:12:32,111 --> 00:12:35,342
<i>I tried to put the pieces
of the puzzle together.</i>

112
00:12:35,986 --> 00:12:39,883
<i>To understand how everything</i>

113
00:12:40,278 --> 00:12:43,300
<i>can continually be reborn
from the same family tree.</i>

114
00:12:44,403 --> 00:12:48,925
<i>Until I realized
that we're not all part of the knot.</i>

115
00:12:49,653 --> 00:12:54,092
<i>Both worlds are an ulcer
that must have grown from something else.</i>

116
00:12:55,694 --> 00:13:00,004
<i>If you remove it, you destroy
everything that was born of it,</i>

117
00:13:00,028 --> 00:13:05,175
<i>but you keep everything alive
that already existed in the origin world.</i>

118
00:13:06,194 --> 00:13:08,258
All these years I believed

119
00:13:09,069 --> 00:13:11,008
that she was my daughter.

120
00:13:13,028 --> 00:13:16,133
For a long time,
I wished you were the father.

121
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:25,883
But it's better this way.

122
00:13:27,819 --> 00:13:29,675
She isn't tied to the knot.

123
00:13:32,236 --> 00:13:33,758
She will live.

124
00:13:34,611 --> 00:13:36,800
<i>But just like you and Eve,</i>

125
00:13:37,236 --> 00:13:39,717
<i>I had to preserve everything,</i>

126
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,508
<i>in order to become what I am today.</i>

127
00:13:45,444 --> 00:13:47,133
You know what has to be done.

128
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:50,675
Do it quickly.

129
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:52,592
Don't let her suffer.

130
00:13:54,278 --> 00:13:56,217
What she's living is hardly a life.

131
00:13:57,778 --> 00:13:59,342
It must happen...

132
00:14:00,361 --> 00:14:03,633
so I'll move heaven and earth to avert it.

133
00:14:16,944 --> 00:14:20,550
<i>Just like you,
I've brought pain and suffering to others.</i>

134
00:14:20,653 --> 00:14:22,550
<i>Again and again.</i>

135
00:14:23,069 --> 00:14:26,217
<i>So that my path could lead me
here to you today.</i>

136
00:14:38,403 --> 00:14:40,133
<i>Everything I did</i>

137
00:14:41,361 --> 00:14:43,420
<i>was for Regina.</i>

138
00:14:45,903 --> 00:14:49,629
<i>All these years,
I've searched in both worlds for a way</i>

139
00:14:49,653 --> 00:14:51,592
<i>for her to live.</i>

140
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:57,675
<i>A way to break
the chain of cause and effect.</i>

141
00:15:19,236 --> 00:15:23,425
<i>Both in your world and in Eve's</i>

142
00:15:24,236 --> 00:15:27,842
<i>I've tried to understand
how everything is connected.</i>

143
00:15:28,569 --> 00:15:30,592
<i>Truly connected.</i>

144
00:15:31,403 --> 00:15:32,712
<i>Until I understood</i>

145
00:15:32,736 --> 00:15:36,508
<i>that our two worlds
were created from another.</i>

146
00:15:37,653 --> 00:15:41,008
<i>That Regina will always die
in both of our worlds.</i>

147
00:15:42,278 --> 00:15:46,008
<i>That she can only live in the world
which everything was created from.</i>

148
00:15:47,111 --> 00:15:48,967
<i>The origin world.</i>

149
00:15:50,486 --> 00:15:51,883
<i>I lied to you.</i>

150
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:55,050
<i>And to Eve.</i>

151
00:15:56,778 --> 00:15:59,842
<i>But the knot had to stay tied.</i>

152
00:16:00,778 --> 00:16:04,092
<i>I had to make sure
you were both in the dark.</i>

153
00:16:04,944 --> 00:16:07,967
<i>To keep everyone in this knot in the dark.</i>

154
00:16:09,778 --> 00:16:13,633
<i>Everything had to happen
the way it always has.</i>

155
00:16:14,069 --> 00:16:17,092
<i>In your world and in hers.</i>

156
00:16:29,403 --> 00:16:31,717
<i>Every step in this labyrinth</i>

157
00:16:32,611 --> 00:16:35,008
<i>had to be taken as it was before.</i>

158
00:16:42,361 --> 00:16:46,092
<i>An infinite chain of cause and effect</i>

159
00:16:46,444 --> 00:16:51,842
<i>that repeatedly leads us
to our same fate in both worlds.</i>

160
00:16:56,694 --> 00:16:58,425
Excuse me.

161
00:16:59,444 --> 00:17:02,462
You see someone come by here?

162
00:17:02,486 --> 00:17:04,217
An old man?

163
00:17:05,568 --> 00:17:08,550
<i>We do not have
the free will to act in either world.</i>

164
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:12,467
<i>We will forever do
what we have always done before.</i>

165
00:17:14,486 --> 00:17:15,800
Hey!

166
00:17:25,153 --> 00:17:27,175
You're Helge Doppler, aren't you?

167
00:17:28,611 --> 00:17:30,087
Helge.

168
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:32,717
<i>No fate in one world</i>

169
00:17:33,611 --> 00:17:35,254
<i>is better than the other.</i>

170
00:17:35,278 --> 00:17:36,837
What's today's date?

171
00:17:38,861 --> 00:17:40,133
November 8.

172
00:17:41,486 --> 00:17:42,552
What year?

173
00:17:44,819 --> 00:17:48,175
1986.

174
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,758
1986...

175
00:17:57,361 --> 00:18:00,133
I can change that, you know.

176
00:18:00,653 --> 00:18:04,217
I can change the past, and what's to come.

177
00:18:05,028 --> 00:18:06,920
Help!

178
00:18:06,944 --> 00:18:10,212
If you don't exist,
none of this will happen.

179
00:18:10,236 --> 00:18:11,920
Ah!

180
00:18:11,944 --> 00:18:13,010
No!

181
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:18,342
What's in there? Is he in there?

182
00:18:26,528 --> 00:18:29,175
What did you do to him?

183
00:18:54,986 --> 00:18:57,670
<i>As long as the knot exists</i>

184
00:18:57,694 --> 00:19:00,379
<i>we are condemned in both worlds</i>

185
00:19:00,403 --> 00:19:04,087
<i>to feel and incite
every act of suffering anew.</i>

186
00:19:08,111 --> 00:19:11,883
<i>There is no difference
between the two worlds.</i>

187
00:19:12,278 --> 00:19:15,717
<i>Things may not happen in the same way,</i>

188
00:19:16,236 --> 00:19:18,175
<i>or at the same time,</i>

189
00:19:18,486 --> 00:19:19,842
<i>but they always happen.</i>

190
00:19:28,986 --> 00:19:33,050
<i>No one in this knot can escape their fate.</i>

191
00:19:36,153 --> 00:19:38,217
It was you.

192
00:19:56,611 --> 00:20:00,629
<i>Every piece of the puzzle
always finds its place.</i>

193
00:20:06,361 --> 00:20:09,342
<i>Just like you,
I moved the pieces around the chessboard,</i>

194
00:20:09,903 --> 00:20:13,967
<i>and had to look on as everything happened
over and over again.</i>

195
00:20:25,528 --> 00:20:29,133
<i>But I finally know how to untie the knot.</i>

196
00:20:32,278 --> 00:20:36,175
I know where the loophole
you've searched for all these years is.

197
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:38,467
Time.

198
00:20:40,236 --> 00:20:44,842
During the apocalypse it stood still
for a fraction of a second at that point

199
00:20:45,236 --> 00:20:48,175
and that threw everything out of balance.

200
00:20:48,694 --> 00:20:50,550
But when time stands still,

201
00:20:51,236 --> 00:20:55,217
it also momentarily breaks
the chain of cause and effect.

202
00:20:58,569 --> 00:20:59,800
One can...

203
00:21:00,486 --> 00:21:02,300
change things?

204
00:21:04,569 --> 00:21:06,300
Eve knows that.

205
00:21:07,236 --> 00:21:09,087
She uses the loophole in your world

206
00:21:09,111 --> 00:21:12,633
to send her younger self off
in one direction or another,

207
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:15,925
and in doing so maintains the cycle.

208
00:21:16,778 --> 00:21:21,504
I used it to make myself run
in a different direction too,

209
00:21:21,528 --> 00:21:23,050
to be here today.

210
00:21:24,403 --> 00:21:28,758
You must use it
to send Jonas on a different path.

211
00:21:29,569 --> 00:21:32,342
To break this cycle once and for all.

212
00:21:33,361 --> 00:21:35,129
Jonas and Martha

213
00:21:35,153 --> 00:21:38,587
are to blame for everything happening
over and over again.

214
00:21:38,611 --> 00:21:40,800
You must send them to the origin world,

215
00:21:41,236 --> 00:21:44,050
so they can finally put an end to this.

216
00:22:13,569 --> 00:22:15,842
I promise.

217
00:22:18,153 --> 00:22:19,712
I'll make it right.

218
00:22:35,111 --> 00:22:37,050
What are you doing here?

219
00:22:38,444 --> 00:22:39,550
She'd dead!

220
00:22:44,069 --> 00:22:46,092
What do you want from me?

221
00:22:46,653 --> 00:22:48,925
I'll tell you everything. All of it.

222
00:22:49,778 --> 00:22:51,758
But we have to get out of here first.

223
00:22:55,153 --> 00:22:56,425
What are you doing?

224
00:22:58,694 --> 00:23:00,170
What is that?

225
00:23:03,653 --> 00:23:05,383
What is that?

226
00:23:05,903 --> 00:23:08,175
That is our last hope.

227
00:23:25,444 --> 00:23:27,295
How did you do that?

228
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:29,175
What time is this?

229
00:23:31,194 --> 00:23:33,383
The question isn't what time...

230
00:23:36,444 --> 00:23:38,467
but what world.

231
00:23:46,486 --> 00:23:47,925
What are you saying?

232
00:23:49,736 --> 00:23:51,217
There is a way

233
00:23:52,778 --> 00:23:55,175
that you can avoid becoming me.

234
00:23:55,653 --> 00:23:59,550
A way where all of this
never needs to happen.

235
00:23:59,736 --> 00:24:03,258
But you, Jonas, you must trust me.

236
00:24:33,694 --> 00:24:35,758
You don't have much time left.

237
00:24:36,361 --> 00:24:39,967
The other Martha, you must save her.

238
00:24:43,111 --> 00:24:44,633
The other Martha?

239
00:24:45,944 --> 00:24:48,342
All these years I had thought that...

240
00:24:49,653 --> 00:24:52,592
that I, alone, had to change things.

241
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:55,758
But it's just as much her fault.

242
00:24:57,944 --> 00:25:00,467
You are two parts of the same whole.

243
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:03,967
Only together can you return
to the origin world.

244
00:25:05,444 --> 00:25:07,633
What we know is a drop.

245
00:25:08,611 --> 00:25:10,300
What we do not know...

246
00:25:11,778 --> 00:25:13,300
is an ocean.

247
00:25:16,236 --> 00:25:17,842
What are you saying?

248
00:25:26,153 --> 00:25:27,842
Tick... tock.

249
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,467
Ticktock.

250
00:25:32,153 --> 00:25:33,675
Ticktock.

251
00:25:40,069 --> 00:25:43,967
Today is the day of the apocalypse,
in her world.

252
00:25:47,861 --> 00:25:49,550
The loophole,

253
00:25:50,153 --> 00:25:52,092
it also exists here.

254
00:25:53,528 --> 00:25:57,425
For a moment time will stand still.

255
00:26:01,361 --> 00:26:03,467
You must get Martha...

256
00:26:05,111 --> 00:26:07,758
before Magnus and Franziska get her.

257
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:13,425
And before everything happens again.

258
00:26:20,778 --> 00:26:24,133
You two are our last hope.

259
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:30,967
Adam will send Jonas on his way.

260
00:26:32,444 --> 00:26:33,717
He and Martha,

261
00:26:34,403 --> 00:26:37,883
they will stop
all this from ever happening.

262
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:55,467
Dad.

263
00:26:59,444 --> 00:27:01,342
Tell him that I'm sorry.

264
00:27:21,444 --> 00:27:23,258
If all this works,

265
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:26,967
then Regina will live.

266
00:28:56,028 --> 00:28:57,420
Martha?

267
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:59,592
What's going on here?

268
00:29:02,486 --> 00:29:03,592
Martha?

269
00:29:07,903 --> 00:29:10,967
- You have to come with us.
- Come where?

270
00:29:42,361 --> 00:29:43,883
What's going on?

271
00:29:56,986 --> 00:29:58,092
You're alive.

272
00:30:07,986 --> 00:30:09,883
You look exactly like her.

273
00:30:29,444 --> 00:30:31,467
You don't know who I am.

274
00:30:43,403 --> 00:30:45,092
What time are we in?

275
00:30:53,361 --> 00:30:54,883
When are we?

276
00:30:55,903 --> 00:30:57,675
Why are we here?

277
00:31:04,194 --> 00:31:06,967
Today's the 21st of June 1986.

278
00:31:07,194 --> 00:31:09,800
The day our worlds were created.

279
00:31:10,194 --> 00:31:13,008
Not here, just in his world.

280
00:31:14,736 --> 00:31:16,837
Tannhaus, the clockmaker,

281
00:31:16,861 --> 00:31:19,462
will open the passage
for the first time today.

282
00:31:19,486 --> 00:31:20,633
What?

283
00:31:25,069 --> 00:31:26,508
Our time's running out.

284
00:31:27,736 --> 00:31:29,883
We have to prevent it from ever happening.

285
00:31:30,611 --> 00:31:31,677
Wait!

286
00:31:33,069 --> 00:31:34,633
What does that mean?

287
00:33:17,653 --> 00:33:19,008
Where are we going?

288
00:33:20,861 --> 00:33:23,425
We're returning someone from the dead.

289
00:33:25,819 --> 00:33:27,258
What are you saying?

290
00:33:27,736 --> 00:33:29,883
It's difficult to explain.

291
00:33:31,069 --> 00:33:33,383
We have to get them before they die.

292
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:40,800
What are you trying to do?

293
00:33:52,819 --> 00:33:54,258
You and I...

294
00:33:56,528 --> 00:33:59,342
we're the reason that all of this happens.

295
00:34:01,903 --> 00:34:04,008
Time and time again.

296
00:34:06,569 --> 00:34:09,175
Because you can't let go of what you want.

297
00:34:11,444 --> 00:34:13,467
And I can't let go of what I want.

298
00:34:15,569 --> 00:34:17,508
But we are the glitch.

299
00:34:21,236 --> 00:34:23,133
The glitch in the matrix.

300
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:33,383
You want them to never exist.

301
00:34:36,528 --> 00:34:38,342
Your world and mine.

302
00:34:40,528 --> 00:34:42,550
That we never exist.

303
00:35:56,528 --> 00:35:58,675
I've been expecting you.

304
00:36:04,069 --> 00:36:06,092
I know why you're here.

305
00:36:24,736 --> 00:36:26,425
But in the end

306
00:36:27,569 --> 00:36:31,342
every death is just a new beginning.

307
00:36:45,153 --> 00:36:47,008
You cannot win.

308
00:36:47,944 --> 00:36:49,254
My demise

309
00:36:49,278 --> 00:36:52,092
is only another step in the cycle.

310
00:36:53,028 --> 00:36:55,050
You're going to kill me today.

311
00:36:56,569 --> 00:36:58,383
Martha finds my body.

312
00:37:00,194 --> 00:37:03,050
Just as I once found myself.

313
00:37:05,361 --> 00:37:08,008
It turns her against you once and for all.

314
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:12,675
What are you waiting for?

315
00:37:41,861 --> 00:37:43,217
This isn't right.

316
00:37:45,569 --> 00:37:47,800
It didn't happen like this.

317
00:37:49,361 --> 00:37:52,383
It... It never happened like this.

318
00:37:54,944 --> 00:37:57,508
You have me killed.

319
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:00,883
Every time.

320
00:38:01,444 --> 00:38:03,175
You will die.

321
00:38:06,153 --> 00:38:08,175
I will die.

322
00:38:09,361 --> 00:38:11,967
And everything that has grown out of us.

323
00:38:14,861 --> 00:38:16,550
What have you done?

324
00:38:28,611 --> 00:38:30,967
Life is a labyrinth.

325
00:38:31,278 --> 00:38:34,717
Some wander around until their death

326
00:38:34,903 --> 00:38:36,842
in search of a way out of it.

327
00:38:40,403 --> 00:38:42,717
<i>But there is only one path,</i>

328
00:38:44,153 --> 00:38:46,675
<i>and it leads ever deeper inside.</i>

329
00:38:48,528 --> 00:38:52,300
<i>Only when one reaches the center</i>

330
00:38:52,653 --> 00:38:54,300
<i>will one understand.</i>

331
00:38:57,694 --> 00:39:01,258
Death is incomprehensible.

332
00:39:03,444 --> 00:39:06,008
But one can reconcile oneself with it.

333
00:39:10,153 --> 00:39:12,175
All that we've done...

334
00:39:14,444 --> 00:39:16,383
is ultimately forgotten.

335
00:39:22,653 --> 00:39:24,467
<i>We are responsible...</i>

336
00:39:25,153 --> 00:39:27,967
<i>for this never-ending déjà vu.</i>

337
00:39:31,903 --> 00:39:34,050
<i>And we're the ones</i>

338
00:39:34,403 --> 00:39:36,300
<i>who have to end it.</i>

339
00:39:41,111 --> 00:39:42,383
We...

340
00:39:43,278 --> 00:39:45,550
are the mistake.

341
00:39:47,569 --> 00:39:49,342
You and I.

342
00:40:04,653 --> 00:40:09,592
<i>Both of our fates
are bound together in eternal damnation.</i>

343
00:40:10,486 --> 00:40:12,592
<i>Across both worlds.</i>

344
00:40:14,028 --> 00:40:16,717
<i>All is cause and effect.</i>

345
00:40:17,819 --> 00:40:21,092
<i>Every pain tempts us to act,</i>

346
00:40:21,569 --> 00:40:23,342
<i>forms our will.</i>

347
00:40:24,903 --> 00:40:26,920
<i>Tannhaus lost everything</i>

348
00:40:26,944 --> 00:40:30,675
<i>that ever meant anything to him
in the origin world.</i>

349
00:40:31,778 --> 00:40:34,962
<i>His son, his daughter-in-law
and his granddaughter</i>

350
00:40:34,986 --> 00:40:37,550
<i>died in a car accident.</i>

351
00:40:38,028 --> 00:40:40,467
<i>They were forced off a bridge</i>

352
00:40:40,903 --> 00:40:42,633
<i>and drowned in the river.</i>

353
00:40:44,653 --> 00:40:47,383
<i>He could never let go of his pain.</i>

354
00:40:52,278 --> 00:40:54,092
<i>Jonas and Martha...</i>

355
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:57,550
<i>must take his pain away.</i>

356
00:40:58,986 --> 00:41:01,670
<i>So that he never looks for a way</i>

357
00:41:01,694 --> 00:41:03,883
<i>to undo everything.</i>

358
00:41:07,361 --> 00:41:10,550
<i>They must go to the origin world...</i>

359
00:41:12,028 --> 00:41:14,342
<i>and prevent our two worlds...</i>

360
00:41:14,944 --> 00:41:18,342
<i>from ever being created.</i>

361
00:41:35,861 --> 00:41:39,800
This is the moment
the passage was first opened in any world.

362
00:41:48,694 --> 00:41:53,050
He wanted to travel back to a world
in which his family was still alive.

363
00:41:56,819 --> 00:41:59,633
But instead, his own world was split.

364
00:42:01,486 --> 00:42:03,508
And the knot was created.

365
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:07,925
We were created.

366
00:42:14,194 --> 00:42:18,217
It'll be any time now
when a bridge will come.

367
00:42:21,444 --> 00:42:23,342
Connecting all three worlds.

368
00:42:27,903 --> 00:42:29,842
You're going to his world.

369
00:42:32,486 --> 00:42:36,383
To get to the moment his suffering began,
we'll have to travel back.

370
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:53,260
Jonas...

371
00:42:55,903 --> 00:42:57,300
The one in your world...

372
00:43:00,903 --> 00:43:02,258
Was he different?

373
00:43:52,403 --> 00:43:53,758
It's beginning.

374
00:45:09,028 --> 00:45:11,133
Martha?

375
00:45:29,069 --> 00:45:31,004
Martha!

376
00:45:48,694 --> 00:45:50,550
Jonas?

377
00:46:01,486 --> 00:46:03,212
Jonas!

378
00:46:12,153 --> 00:46:14,383
Martha!

379
00:46:25,319 --> 00:46:26,425
Jonas!

380
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:04,508
Martha?

381
00:47:05,194 --> 00:47:07,133
Oh, there you are!

382
00:47:09,819 --> 00:47:11,842
He looks so sad.

383
00:47:12,903 --> 00:47:16,633
- Who looks so sad?
- The boy standing there.

384
00:47:17,861 --> 00:47:21,508
There's no one there.
It's only the back of your closet.

385
00:47:37,861 --> 00:47:39,425
Jonas.

386
00:47:40,361 --> 00:47:42,092
Is everything okay?

387
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:46,008
What do you want in the basement?

388
00:47:50,694 --> 00:47:51,967
What is it?

389
00:47:52,778 --> 00:47:54,883
There's a girl standing there.

390
00:47:56,653 --> 00:47:59,258
There's no girl there.

391
00:48:04,819 --> 00:48:07,550
Come on,
let's go back to the others, okay?

392
00:48:20,403 --> 00:48:22,092
Come on.

393
00:48:55,819 --> 00:48:57,175
[both gasp

394
00:50:18,361 --> 00:50:22,800
Why do you always have to bring it up?
Can't you just let it go for once?

395
00:50:24,611 --> 00:50:27,175
I just thought you wanted the store.

396
00:50:28,653 --> 00:50:31,592
- Not now, but eventually.
- You never listen.

397
00:50:32,194 --> 00:50:34,717
No wonder Mom couldn't stand it here.

398
00:50:35,444 --> 00:50:38,170
Your endless lecturing,
Big Bang, Big Crunch...

399
00:50:38,194 --> 00:50:40,800
Has Sonja ever been asked
if she's interested?

400
00:50:42,028 --> 00:50:45,129
In all these years
have you ever asked if I'm interested?

401
00:50:45,153 --> 00:50:46,842
Or what I want?

402
00:50:52,361 --> 00:50:53,967
It's raining outside.

403
00:50:58,944 --> 00:51:01,050
Is that all you have to say to us?

404
00:51:06,778 --> 00:51:07,879
Marek, come on.

405
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:10,545
You told me the world outside
is full of secrets.

406
00:51:10,569 --> 00:51:13,925
And what we know is a drop
in an unending ocean, yeah?

407
00:51:14,653 --> 00:51:16,462
At least you were right about that.

408
00:51:16,486 --> 00:51:19,712
You may know everything about
Einstein-Rosen bridges and black holes,

409
00:51:19,736 --> 00:51:21,217
but about me...

410
00:51:22,153 --> 00:51:24,217
You know absolutely nothing about me.

411
00:51:38,653 --> 00:51:41,550
I... I thought you'd be here a bit longer.

412
00:51:42,944 --> 00:51:44,633
He's going to cool off.

413
00:52:10,653 --> 00:52:12,717
Was that really necessary?

414
00:52:13,653 --> 00:52:16,258
We could just as well have left tomorrow.

415
00:52:18,944 --> 00:52:20,550
You're ashamed of him.

416
00:52:22,819 --> 00:52:25,629
You have no idea who he is.
To have to grow up with that...

417
00:52:25,653 --> 00:52:27,883
He lives in his head, in his big ideas.

418
00:52:28,069 --> 00:52:30,092
Have you ever seen the shit he makes?

419
00:52:30,694 --> 00:52:33,670
I can't understand
why people even watch stuff like that.

420
00:52:33,694 --> 00:52:37,212
Moons, theories, stars,
galaxies, stupid universes...

421
00:52:37,236 --> 00:52:39,837
But me? He never saw me.

422
00:52:47,819 --> 00:52:49,883
You can't choose your family.

423
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:55,385
Yeah.

424
00:52:57,653 --> 00:52:59,258
But I chose you.

425
00:53:01,319 --> 00:53:02,385
Yeah.

426
00:53:04,361 --> 00:53:06,175
You chose me.

427
00:53:13,403 --> 00:53:14,758
Look out!

428
00:53:19,319 --> 00:53:21,300
Shh.

429
00:53:23,236 --> 00:53:25,633
Are you okay? Yeah?

430
00:53:30,569 --> 00:53:32,379
What are they doing there?

431
00:53:32,403 --> 00:53:33,717
Wait a second.

432
00:53:35,278 --> 00:53:37,008
Are you both insane?

433
00:53:37,903 --> 00:53:40,717
You can't just hang out here!
I almost ran you over!

434
00:53:54,444 --> 00:53:55,550
Are you guys okay?

435
00:54:00,944 --> 00:54:02,383
Do you need help?

436
00:54:05,194 --> 00:54:07,008
The bridge isn't open.

437
00:54:09,278 --> 00:54:10,344
What?

438
00:54:11,653 --> 00:54:13,133
There's been an accident.

439
00:54:13,403 --> 00:54:15,467
You think this is funny?

440
00:54:17,569 --> 00:54:19,467
Go home, get inside.

441
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:22,092
What we know is a drop.

442
00:54:23,819 --> 00:54:25,633
What we do not know is an ocean.

443
00:54:28,778 --> 00:54:30,592
Your father loves you.

444
00:54:32,944 --> 00:54:34,925
He would do anything for you.

445
00:54:44,153 --> 00:54:45,633
What did you just say?

446
00:54:46,611 --> 00:54:47,758
Marek?

447
00:54:49,028 --> 00:54:50,133
Are they okay?

448
00:55:04,861 --> 00:55:06,592
The bridge isn't open.

449
00:55:11,278 --> 00:55:13,467
Come on. Let's go.

450
00:55:14,028 --> 00:55:15,175
Marek!

451
00:55:28,486 --> 00:55:30,342
What was that?

452
00:55:35,403 --> 00:55:36,758
You were right.

453
00:55:38,778 --> 00:55:40,383
We'll drive back tomorrow.

454
00:56:22,111 --> 00:56:23,837
You returned?

455
00:56:23,861 --> 00:56:25,842
The bridge isn't open.

456
00:56:27,028 --> 00:56:29,837
Your son thinks he saw a pair of angels.

457
00:56:29,861 --> 00:56:31,175
Don't make fun of me.

458
00:56:36,611 --> 00:56:38,050
I don't know why, I...

459
00:56:40,861 --> 00:56:42,592
I suddenly had this...

460
00:56:43,736 --> 00:56:45,217
this feeling.

461
00:57:10,069 --> 00:57:12,008
I'm glad that you're here.

462
00:57:17,069 --> 00:57:19,420
I haven't even stripped the beds.

463
00:57:23,236 --> 00:57:25,092
I'll bring the bags upstairs.

464
00:57:35,444 --> 00:57:36,510
Thanks.

465
00:57:43,028 --> 00:57:44,383
Would you like to hold her?

466
00:57:48,028 --> 00:57:50,133
Take good care of Charlotte.

467
00:57:53,444 --> 00:57:54,967
I'll help Marek.

468
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:37,967
Do you think it worked?

469
00:59:06,444 --> 00:59:08,175
In the light...

470
00:59:11,569 --> 00:59:13,092
I saw you.

471
00:59:16,069 --> 00:59:17,135
As a child.

472
00:59:23,694 --> 00:59:25,550
You were looking in my direction,

473
00:59:29,569 --> 00:59:31,925
as if we could see each other.

474
00:59:37,278 --> 00:59:38,717
The closet?

475
00:59:45,069 --> 00:59:46,342
That was you?

476
00:59:51,861 --> 00:59:53,425
It wasn't a dream.

477
01:00:13,236 --> 01:00:15,508
I wonder if anything of us will remain.

478
01:00:19,819 --> 01:00:21,800
Or is that what we are?

479
01:00:24,778 --> 01:00:25,925
A dream?

480
01:00:29,153 --> 01:00:31,175
And we never really existed?

481
01:00:36,069 --> 01:00:37,550
I don't know.

482
01:01:14,069 --> 01:01:16,133
You and I are perfect for each other.

483
01:01:22,903 --> 01:01:24,758
Never believe anything else.

- Should we reheat the lasagne?
- Yeah.

508
01:04:04,903 --> 01:04:06,295
Let me help you.

509
01:04:06,319 --> 01:04:09,379
- Shall I open another bottle?
- Absolutely!

510
01:04:09,403 --> 01:04:10,795
Hey, do I get some?

511
01:04:10,819 --> 01:04:13,550
- And now, a toast to Regina.
- Yes.

512
01:04:15,569 --> 01:04:17,883
- To you.
- To you.

513
01:04:19,069 --> 01:04:20,675
And thank you for the invitation.

514
01:04:21,069 --> 01:04:22,967
- Of course.
- Here's to you.

515
01:04:33,528 --> 01:04:36,754
Your eye. It looks way better.

516
01:04:36,778 --> 01:04:40,050
You never actually told us
what happened.

517
01:04:40,403 --> 01:04:43,467
- You never told me either.
- Tell us.

518
01:04:44,486 --> 01:04:47,258
- But promise not to tell anyone.
- Tell us!

519
01:04:48,236 --> 01:04:50,129
Last summer...

520
01:04:53,861 --> 01:04:56,420
Shit. That scared me.

521
01:04:57,736 --> 01:04:59,129
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

522
01:04:59,153 --> 01:05:01,879
Is this the apocalypse?

523
01:05:01,903 --> 01:05:04,967
- I'll light some candles.
- Does anyone have a lighter?

524
01:05:08,361 --> 01:05:09,379
Yeah, here.

525
01:05:09,403 --> 01:05:11,092
Hannah?

526
01:05:14,778 --> 01:05:16,383
Are you okay?

527
01:05:22,153 --> 01:05:24,050
Hey? Everything okay?

528
01:05:25,778 --> 01:05:28,842
I'm not sure.
I think I just had déjà vu or something.

529
01:05:33,236 --> 01:05:36,342
This is going to sound
utterly absurd, but...

530
01:05:37,986 --> 01:05:40,467
What happened now, last night...

531
01:05:41,403 --> 01:05:42,967
that's what I dreamed about.

532
01:05:44,611 --> 01:05:46,258
The light was flickering,

533
01:05:46,819 --> 01:05:48,800
loud thunder outside,

534
01:05:49,819 --> 01:05:52,717
and then the place was totally dark.

535
01:05:55,403 --> 01:05:56,508
And somehow...

536
01:05:58,403 --> 01:06:01,008
the world had ended.

537
01:06:01,861 --> 01:06:03,342
The world had ended?

538
01:06:04,694 --> 01:06:06,008
Yeah, I don't know.

539
01:06:07,528 --> 01:06:10,092
It was just dark
and it was never light again.

540
01:06:12,944 --> 01:06:15,467
And the weird thing is...

541
01:06:19,528 --> 01:06:21,258
that it felt really good.

542
01:06:23,194 --> 01:06:24,717
For everything to be over.

543
01:06:26,028 --> 01:06:29,175
Like suddenly being free of everything.

544
01:06:30,528 --> 01:06:31,717
No wants.

545
01:06:33,444 --> 01:06:34,510
No needs.

546
01:06:39,278 --> 01:06:40,633
Unending darkness.

547
01:06:44,486 --> 01:06:45,633
No yesterday.

548
01:06:46,569 --> 01:06:47,675
No today.

549
01:06:49,278 --> 01:06:50,383
No tomorrow.

550
01:06:54,611 --> 01:06:55,758
Nothing.

551
01:07:00,153 --> 01:07:02,967
You really need to get that analyzed.

552
01:07:08,694 --> 01:07:10,508
I'm sure it's just the hormones.

553
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:14,133
If the world were to end today

554
01:07:14,569 --> 01:07:16,717
and you only had one wish,

555
01:07:17,111 --> 01:07:18,800
what would you wish for?

556
01:07:23,736 --> 01:07:25,467
A world without Winden.

557
01:07:28,694 --> 01:07:31,383
- Let's drink to that.
- Yes.

558
01:07:31,944 --> 01:07:36,008
- A world without Winden.
- A world without Winden.

559
01:07:36,444 --> 01:07:37,550
Ah.

560
01:07:38,778 --> 01:07:41,800
Looks like Winden doesn't want
to just disappear.

561
01:07:43,486 --> 01:07:45,383
Maybe it's for the best.

562
01:07:49,028 --> 01:07:50,675
Have you chosen a name?

563
01:07:55,694 --> 01:07:57,467
I don't know.

564
01:08:09,319 --> 01:08:11,592
I always thought "Jonas" was a good name.
