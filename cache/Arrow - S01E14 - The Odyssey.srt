1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,849
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,162
For five years,
I was stranded on an island...

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,243
...with only one goal:

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,611
Survive.

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,921
Oliver Queen is alive.

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,526
Now I will fulfill my father's dying wish:

7
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,842
To use the list of names he left me...

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,401
...and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

9
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,124
To do this,
I must become someone else.

10
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,489
I must become something else.

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,926
Previously on Arrow:

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,209
Slade Wilson.
There's an airfield 'IO clicks from here.

13
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,931
It's key off this island.
I think Yao Fei sent you...

14
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,560
...because he knows
I cannot take the airstrip alone.

15
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,808
- You bugged my mother?
- Just listen.

16
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,128
I made it clear to him persuasively...

17
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,282
...that his plans
endangered the Undertaking.

18
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,609
- What are you gonna do?
- I need another chat with my mom.

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,084
I'll need the Unidac merger
finalized by the end of the week.

20
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,930
We're on something of a clock here.

21
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:12,567
Moira Queen, you have failed this city.

22
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,645
Stand still.

23
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,370
Please don't kill me.

24
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,651
Do you know anything
about your husband's disappearance?

25
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,087
- What?
- Is Walter Steele still alive?

26
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,968
I don't know where my husband is.
I swear.

27
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,966
Do you know anything about the Undertaking?

28
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,088
I said don't move!

29
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,442
L... I'm a mother.

30
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:43,242
I have a son, Oliver. A daughter.
Her name is Thea.

31
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,768
She's just a teenager.
Please don't take me from my children.

32
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,846
They've lost their father.

33
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,688
They can't lose me too.

34
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,048
Please, whoever you are, please.

35
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,406
Okay.

36
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,964
I'm not gonna hurt you.

37
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,402
This is Moira Queen.
I'm on the 39th floor. I need help.

38
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,722
There's an intruder.

39
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,564
Please.

40
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,930
I'm not gonna hurt you, Felicity.

41
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,525
How do you know my name?

42
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,885
Because you know my name.

43
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,366
Mr...

44
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,081
Oliver. Oh. Wow.

45
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,521
Everything about you
just became so unbelievably clear.

46
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,121
- You're bleeding.
- I don't need to be told that.

47
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,009
- You need a hospital.
- My...

48
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,049
My father's old factory in the Glades.

49
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,362
No, you need a doctor,
not a steel worker.

50
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,320
Felicity, you have to promise me
that you are gonna take me...

51
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,847
...to my father's factory
and nowhere else.

52
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,005
Yeah, promise.

53
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,208
Something tells me bloodstains
are not covered under my lease.

54
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,447
So far,
the police are unwilling to comment...

55
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,841
...but unsubstantiated
eyewitness reports claim...

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,685
...the Starling City vigilante
attacked Mrs. Queen...

57
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,128
...in her office earlier tonight.
She was unharmed in the assault.

58
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,163
Excuse me.

59
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,482
Can you help me? He's really heavy.

60
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,131
Oh, damn it. He just missed a carotid.

61
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,768
It's a zone two wound. Press there.

62
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,242
- I should've taken him to a hospital.
- No.

63
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,402
That's why he asked you
to bring him here.

64
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,882
Because he knew the police would wanna know
how and why he got that wound.

65
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,567
I'm guessing "how" and "why" are Oliver
Queen's least favorite questions.

66
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,930
Yeah, well, there's also "when" and
"where," he's not too fond of.

67
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:22,450
- So if we can't bring him to the hospital...
- We are bringing the hospital to him.

68
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,250
- Is that...?
- Yeah.

69
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,724
His blood. He stored it for a rainy day.
And I say right now, it's pouring.

70
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,564
- Mm.
- I got it. Over there.

71
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,131
Do you know what you're doing?

72
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,726
Yeah, I had some medical training
in the Army.

73
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,602
I just hope it's enough.

74
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,086
Remember playing Operation
when you were a kid?

75
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,651
Yes. Heh.

76
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,088
- It never made me want to throw up.
- Hey, Felicity, listen. Trust me.

77
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,323
He'll be fine.
He's been through a lot worse than this.

78
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,970
Dead.

79
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,403
How did you survive here
for six months?

80
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,563
I know Girl Scouts
who have more fight in them.

81
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,245
Fighting Girl Scouts now, Slade, huh?

82
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,811
Aah!

83
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,287
- What the hell?
- Listen, kid.

84
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,046
We have 10 days
until the supply plane lands.

85
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,170
Ten days to turn you
into at least half a soldier.

86
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,369
So start taking it seriously.

87
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,331
Aah! What is the point of this?

88
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,605
These soldiers don't carry bamboo!
They have guns!

89
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,003
So, what am I supposed to do
if one of them jams a gun in my face, huh?

90
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,571
Threaten them with my stick?

91
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,925
Jam this in my face.

92
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,521
Do it.

93
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,285
I give up. I give up.

94
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,968
There is no giving up to these guys!

95
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,681
No crying or buying your way
out of it!

96
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,366
You have two choices.

97
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,724
Escape or die.

98
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,882
So choose.

99
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,560
Escape.

100
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,482
Then let me show you how not to die.

101
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,684
Lian Yu.

102
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,649
It's the name of the island, I know.

103
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,604
It's Mandarin for "purgatory."

104
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,491
It is? Wonderful.

105
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,048
Is that the airstrip?

106
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,680
ASIS took satellite images
of the whole island.

107
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,969
This is Fyers' main camp,
where I was held for almost a year.

108
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,848
Do you think that's where Yao Fei is now?

109
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,400
'Cause we can get a message to him.

110
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,087
- Tell him we found a way off the island.
- Forget about him.

111
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,564
This is the airstrip.

112
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,082
And these infrared images show...

113
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,489
...there are at least 10 soldiers guarding
the perimeter at any given time.

114
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,324
- Too many of them for you?
- No.

115
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,967
My problem is the guy here
in the tower.

116
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,925
It's a PATC.
A portable air traffic control tower.

117
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,771
The U.S. government set up these
for disaster zones...

118
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,645
...like Thailand after the tsunami.

119
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,291
So, what's the problem?

120
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,364
The glass is bulletproof.

121
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,444
I can't take out the tower guard
with my sniper rifle.

122
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,969
And if he suspects anything's wrong,
he'll radio Fyers and we're cancelled.

123
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,162
It'll be up to you to take him out.

124
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,607
Up close and personal.

125
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,966
Are you ready for that?

126
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,768
Do you think I'm ready?

127
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,042
What I think is there is only one
supply plane every three months.

128
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,051
We leave tomorrow,
or we die soon afterwards.

129
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,971
I pick leaving.

130
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,165
So get some sleep.

131
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,890
We leave at 0600.

132
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,368
Don't worry. You'll be back
with your girlfriend soon enough.

133
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,606
Morning.

134
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,485
Please don't hate me.

135
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,643
Why would I hate you?

136
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,647
For cheating on you with Sara.

137
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,210
Did it hurt, Ollie?

138
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,681
- Did what hurt?
- When they killed you.

139
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,843
Rise and shine.

140
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,970
Come on.

141
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,083
We're moving out.

142
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,131
All clear.

143
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,524
Hey, can we, uh...?

144
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,523
Can we rest for a second?

145
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,523
You can rest on the plane.

146
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,082
Yeah, well, really looking forward
to that in-flight movie.

147
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,724
- Oh, God.
- Don't move.

148
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,410
Is it a mine?

149
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,361
- Yeah.
- The soldiers mined the island?

150
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,450
No. It's probably Japanese.
Left over from World War ll.

151
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,090
Still active. Impressive.

152
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,366
Can you disarm it?

153
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,369
Without disarming you?

154
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,522
Soldiers.

155
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,286
They're gonna see us.

156
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,520
They're going to see you.

157
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,603
Wait. Stop.

158
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,330
What are you doing so far from camp?

159
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,204
I got separated from my unit.

160
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,809
Come with us.

161
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,761
I can't.

162
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,163
I'm kind of having a bad day,
you know?

163
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,924
Be still.

164
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,729
Thanks.

165
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,608
Yao Fei. Come in. Sit.

166
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,291
Now, the first time I saw you
with this contraption...

167
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,528
...I thought you looked
utterly ridiculous.

168
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,521
That is, until you took out
three of my best men with it.

169
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,370
Twenty-five compound bows...

170
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,410
...will be arriving
on tomorrow's supply plane.

171
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,046
I'd like you to train a few of my men
on how to use them.

172
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,003
Archery can take years to master.

173
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,688
I trust you will be
a proficient instructor.

174
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,206
That will be all.

175
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,883
I hope you are steadfast in your
commitment to our cause, Yao Fei.

176
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,926
For her sake.

177
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,690
I am.

178
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:01,850
- Obviously you were never a Boy Scout.
- Yeah? What tipped you off?

179
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,401
We better hurry.

180
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,411
The wolves come out at night.

181
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,685
There are wolves here?

182
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,923
Right. Of course there are.

183
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,482
Because what would the worst place
on Earth be without wolves?

184
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,211
Well, the only thing
that will keep them out is fire.

185
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,846
Well, you know,
you're welcome to help.

186
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,809
Seriously?

187
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,728
I've been working on this
for two hours.

188
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,281
I know, I was watching.

189
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,284
Thank you for the entertainment.

190
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,682
You're gonna wear that thing out
just by looking at it.

191
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,886
Don't worry.

192
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,611
She'll be waiting for flowers
when you get back.

193
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,284
I doubt it.

194
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,370
Remember how I told you
I was shipwrecked here?

195
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,325
Her sister was with me
when the boat went down.

196
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,051
That's funny.
I never took you as being the bad boy.

197
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,049
You seem to lack the spine.

198
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,482
That's why I've gotta get home.

199
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,765
To make this right.

200
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,810
Do you think you can sleep
with your girlfriend's sister...

201
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,368
...and still make it right?
You're dumber than I thought.

202
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,649
And believe me when I tell you,
that is saying something.

203
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:29,971
Yeah, well, you don't really strike me as the
type of guy who accepts apologies, so...

204
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,169
Everybody is in this life
for themselves.

205
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,368
Learn that at Australian spy school?

206
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,126
No.

207
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,044
I learned that here.

208
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,927
Do you remember I told you
that I had a partner?

209
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,491
Yeah.

210
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,608
You remember the guy
who tortured you?

211
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,883
That...? That freak show
was your partner?

212
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,850
- His name's Billy Wintergreen.
- Oh, okay.

213
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,883
Our mission was to exfiltrate Yao Fei...

214
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,765
...find out why Fyers and his men
were so interested in him.

215
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,409
Our bird got shot out of the sky
before we even saw the airstrip.

216
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,050
That's where I found you.

217
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,200
When Fyers took us prisoner,
he asked if we would join him and his men.

218
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,648
Billy accepted Fyers' invitation...

219
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,566
...and I declined.

220
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,325
He was the godfather to my son, Joe...

221
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:29,364
...and yet he turned his back on me
without even thinking twice about it.

222
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:35,170
Everybody is in this life
for themselves.

223
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,771
If you let him radio camp, we're done.

224
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,851
- What about the others?
- You worry about your one.

225
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,445
I'll worry about my 10.

226
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,926
Good job.

227
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,851
I think.

228
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,606
His heart rate's elevated,
but at least the bleeding's stopped.

229
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,926
Thanks for your help.

230
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,320
You kept your head on.

231
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,767
Well, I always wondered
how I'd react...

232
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,400
...if I found my boss shot and bleeding
inside my car.

233
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,243
Not that I helped
because he's my boss.

234
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,962
I'd help anyone who was shot
and bleeding in my car.

235
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,849
I was thinking all of this
would be more of a shock.

236
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,882
- What are you saying, you called this all along?
- I'm not saying anything.

237
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,691
Except Oliver brought me a laptop
riddled with bullet holes...

238
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,569
...had me trace a black arrow...

239
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,690
...and research a company
involved in armored car heists.

240
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,602
I may be blond, but I'm not that blond.

241
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,127
Yeah, Oliver's not too great
with cover stories.

242
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,645
Neither are you.

243
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,889
The two of you with that little
energy drink hangover cure?

244
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,371
Please.

245
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,326
What was really in that vial anyway?

246
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,121
Vertigo.

247
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,806
I knew it. I mean, I didn't
know it was Vertigo for sure...

248
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,361
...but I definitely knew it wasn't
something that can cure a hangover.

249
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,769
Yeah, we needed it analyzed
so we could take down the Count.

250
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,966
- That was you and Oliver?
- And you, Felicity.

251
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,566
Without you, we never would've found him.

252
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,843
But why come to me?

253
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:48,566
Hard as it probably is for him to admit,
even Oliver needs help sometimes.

254
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,566
Damn.

255
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,720
- What's happening?
- There's a syringe labeled Ativan.

256
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,564
It should stop the seizure. Go.

257
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,729
His heart stopped.

258
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,245
I'm calling 911.

259
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,004
No. Wait, you can't.

260
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:58,560
- You know how to use one of those?
- We are about to find out.

261
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,050
You didn't say clear.

262
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,085
I heard the charge. That's good news.

263
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,083
- How's that?
- Might not be the machine.

264
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,163
It could be the wiring.

265
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,845
Come on, come on, come on.

266
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,286
Try again.

267
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,081
Clear.

268
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,042
What the hell did you do?

269
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,808
I've been building computers
since I was 7.

270
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,681
Wires are wires.

271
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,849
What do we do now?

272
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,810
Pray we don't have a heart attack
ourselves.

273
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,962
One job to do
and you manage to screw up even that.

274
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,369
I'm gonna make sure
that everything is clear.

275
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,161
Stay here. Keep the door locked.
Do not let anybody in except for me.

276
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,322
- You got that?
- Yeah.

277
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,331
Here. Keep this.

278
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,247
And try not to shoot yourself
by mistake.

279
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,645
Hello?

280
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,885
Hello?

281
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,808
Is anybody there?

282
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,763
Have you lost your mind?
They might be monitoring the calls.

283
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,685
Island Tower.

284
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,729
This is Skyhawk 801 Foxtrot.

285
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,565
We are 700 kilometers
southeast of your position.

286
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,849
ETA, three hours, 22 minutes, over.

287
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:37,044
Island Tower, Skyhawk 801 Foxtrot,
acknowledged.

288
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,928
Skyhawk 801 Foxtrot, acknowledged.

289
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:48,880
Of all creatures that breathe
and move upon the Earth...

290
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,968
- What is that?
- It's a challenge code.

291
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,324
They're trying to verify our identity.

292
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:02,761
Skyhawk 801 Foxtrot, please repeat.

293
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,847
Of all creatures that breathe
and move upon the Earth...

294
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,886
- Wait.
- What?

295
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,644
Wait, I know this.

296
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,450
I know this.

297
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,206
They picked the one book
that I read in college.

298
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,002
- What the hell are you talking about?
- It's a quote from The Odyssey.

299
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,810
Uh...

300
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:27,285
Of all creatures that breathe
and move upon the Earth, nothing...

301
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,445
Nothing is born
that is weaker than man.

302
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,921
Are you sure about this?

303
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,242
Because if you're wrong,
this plane will turn around.

304
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,767
Yes. I'm positive.

305
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:42,244
Nothing is born
that is weaker than man.

306
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,601
Say it.

307
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,731
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
It's... Sorry, sorry, sorry.

308
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,166
Bred.

309
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,691
Not born. Bred.

310
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,446
Nothing is bred
that is weaker than man.

311
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,204
That's it.

312
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,329
Nothing is bred
that is weaker than man.

313
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,409
Roger that. See you in a few hours. Out.

314
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,491
- The Odyssey?
- Yeah. It's a...

315
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,964
Well, it's a story about a guy
who's trying to get home, so...

316
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,169
Well, after a few days
at Landstuhl Air Base...

317
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,810
...you'll be on your way home.

318
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,561
You sound like
you're not coming with me.

319
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,324
I'll be coming with you.

320
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,047
After I radio in an air strike
on this location.

321
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,449
I'm going to send Fyers and all his men
straight back to hell.

322
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,281
Wait.

323
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,211
You can't blow up the island.

324
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,089
Yao Fei is still out there.

325
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,801
- He is not my concern.
- Really?

326
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,521
He's the only reason you came here.
Rescuing him was your mission.

327
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,920
Well, the mission has changed.

328
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:59,761
Edward Fyers is a mercenary
and he is not on this island by mistake.

329
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,890
He has plans for Lian Yu
that involve Yao Fei.

330
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,249
And whatever they are,
they must end.

331
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,321
Yao Fei saved my life.

332
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:15,405
That is your debt to repay, not mine.

333
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,089
Where are you going?

334
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,609
All my life...

335
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,890
...all that I've ever thought about
is myself.

336
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,088
I took my family for granted.

337
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,971
I betrayed people that I loved.

338
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,283
And I'm not gonna be that person
anymore.

339
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,480
I can't leave Yao Fei here to die.

340
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,530
I won't.

341
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,369
The plane leaves in three hours.

342
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:56,889
If you and your friend are not on it,
I am going to leave without you.

343
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,971
If I don't make it back in time...

344
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,641
...and you get out of here...

345
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,400
...I want you to call my family.

346
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,245
Call my family.

347
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,926
Sure, kid.

348
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,485
- He's going into cardiac arrest again.
- No.

349
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,244
Ah, the leads just came loose.

350
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,770
Aah!

351
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:03,481
It's less stressful
when he's jumping off rooftops.

352
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,489
Yeah.

353
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:11,726
This bow has put arrows
in quite a few people.

354
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,600
Yeah, bad people.

355
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,848
That doesn't bother you?

356
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,769
Because...

357
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,169
And I mean this in a good way.

358
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,529
...You seem like the kind of guy
it would bother.

359
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,171
When I was in Afghanistan,
my unit was tasked...

360
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,324
...with protecting this local warlord.

361
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,964
Gholem Qadir.

362
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,487
Qadir was less than human.
He sold opium.

363
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,766
Sold children.

364
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,408
One day, we were accompanying him
to Mosul...

365
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,001
...when my convoy was ambushed
by insurgents.

366
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,603
We had them outgunned.
Firefight didn't last more than a minute.

367
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,285
When the smoke cleared...

368
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,562
...I moved in on their position.

369
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,364
They were all dead.
I knew which one I had killed.

370
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,284
When I pulled off his keffiyeh, I could
see it was just a kid, no more than 18.

371
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,848
Shot him in the throat.

372
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,923
I killed this kid
to protect this human piece of garbage...

373
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,367
...and I thought, "Am I still good?"

374
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,404
Am I still a good man?"

375
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,282
Doing this with Oliver...

376
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:31,010
...doing what we do, I feel good again
for the first time in a long time.

377
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,483
And that's worth
all the collateral damage?

378
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,161
Haven't killed anyone,
if that's what you're asking.

379
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,441
But he has.

380
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,605
Unfortunately,
there are always casualties...

381
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,967
...when you're fighting a war.

382
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,724
- How did you...?
- Let's go. I'll explain on the way.

383
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,844
- Stupid. You should not have come back.
- I found Slade Wilson.

384
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,010
And he has a way off the island.

385
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,924
- But we have to go right now.
- No.

386
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:48,323
- No.
- What? What do you mean, no?

387
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,405
This is our chance. What reason could you
possibly have for staying here?

388
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,364
Not what.

389
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,210
Who.

390
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:05,486
Now, Mr. Queen, I think it's past time
you left this island.

391
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,642
Permanently.

392
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,368
Island Tower, this is Skyhawk 801 Foxtrot.

393
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,444
We are 5000 feet and holding. Over.

394
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:29,686
Skyhawk 801 Foxtrot,
this is Island Tower.

395
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,763
You are clear to land.

396
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,888
Roger that.

397
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:47,962
Simply to satisfy my own curiosity,
why aren't you already dead?

398
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:51,920
- I saw Yao Fei choke you to death.
- I guess he's not as strong as he looks.

399
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,691
Still, you returned for him.

400
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,808
So you're either a fool...

401
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,446
...or is it possible
you now think yourself a hero?

402
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,601
- I'm not a hero.
- No, of course not.

403
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:08,810
It's not possible to be a hero
when there's nobody worthy of saving.

404
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,446
Is this what you want?

405
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,684
- You want me to fight him again?
- Oh, no, Mr. Queen.

406
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,922
I'm sorry, you're mistaken.

407
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,367
This is not a match.

408
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,686
It's an execution.

409
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,444
I'm sorry.

410
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,405
It's Wintergreen, right?

411
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,725
Bill Wintergreen?

412
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,845
I know all about you.

413
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,841
I know you worked
for the Australian government...

414
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,321
...and that you used to fight
for your country.

415
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,084
You used to stand for something.

416
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,681
Whatever he's paying you, I'll triple it.

417
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,691
- How many of them are there?
- Go, go, go!

418
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,246
Slade. Come back to die?

419
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,090
Was it so easy to betray me, Billy?

420
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,807
Well, Billy...

421
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,604
...you always had a good kick.

422
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:37,330
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Aah!

423
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,767
There goes our ride.

424
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,529
I'm impressed.

425
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:24,365
- You didn't puke.
- I swallowed it.

426
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,490
You can untie me now.

427
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,130
Why did you want me to tie you up
in the first place?

428
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,521
A man in pain is unreliable.

429
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:38,206
I was afraid I might kill you.

430
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,081
Thanks.

431
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,126
What?

432
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,290
I'm trapped on an island...

433
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,006
...and my only friend
is named Wilson, so...

434
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,081
What now?

435
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,521
We hope my fireworks show
set Fyers back...

436
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,760
...maybe enough for those who hired
him in the first place to call things off.

437
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,006
Hired him?

438
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,763
Well, Fyers is a merc.
He follows the money.

439
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:09,491
So he's on this island
under someone's employ.

440
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,051
And what do we do?

441
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,046
We have to make sure that neither
of us dies on this godforsaken island.

442
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,931
I thought you said
if we didn't get on the plane...

443
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,010
...we weren't gonna make it.

444
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,328
Well, that dumb kid that I trained...

445
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,369
...he would never have made it.

446
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,971
You?

447
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,164
You might just have a chance.

448
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,051
Yup, it's Fyers.

449
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,727
Satellites show multiple heat blooms on the
island. What the hell is happening there?

450
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,410
There was a complication.

451
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,562
- Slade Wilson?
- I'm handling it.

452
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,724
Handle it better. I've worked
too hard and planned for too long...

453
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,087
...to have complications arrive
so close to the end.

454
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,004
I assure you, it won't happen again.

455
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,050
- What of Yao Fei?
- I've ensured his cooperation.

456
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,281
Good.

457
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:01,526
I've paid you a lot of money, Fyers.
I expect a return on my investment.

458
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,521
You sent for me?

459
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,768
I'm a man of my word.

460
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,651
You made the right call,
turning in your young castaway.

461
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,010
And for that,
I'll grant you five minutes.

462
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,730
Shado?

463
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,770
Shado? Shado?

464
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,445
Shh, Shh, shh.

465
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,241
I guess I didn't die.

466
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,164
Again.

467
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,411
Cool.

468
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,404
It's not bad.

469
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,961
So how am I gonna explain this one?

470
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,246
Hickey gone wrong?

471
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:28,083
The police collected a sample
of your blood at Queen Consolidated.

472
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:32,689
I just hacked the crime lab
and ordered the sample destroyed.

473
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,844
Oops. Heh.

474
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,769
I hope it's all right. Your system
looked like it was from the '80s...

475
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:45,847
...and not the good part of the '80s,
like Madonna and, well, legwarmers.

476
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,002
It's a lot of work.

477
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,324
Does that mean you're in?

478
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,165
You mean "in"
as in I'm going to join your crusade?

479
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:56,130
You're practically an honorary member
of the team already.

480
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,328
Hm, so Mr. Diggle said.

481
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,046
- No.
- Then why'd you upgrade my system?

482
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:08,127
First, because seeing a network
that poorly set up hurts me in my soul.

483
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,406
- Ahem.
- And second...

484
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,405
...I want to find Walter.

485
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,245
My stepfather.

486
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,921
He was nice to me.

487
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,088
And Mr. Diggle told me
the notebook you use...

488
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:23,086
...to fight crime is the same notebook
that got Walter abducted.

489
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,370
I'll help you rescue him, but that's it.

490
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:31,164
Then I want to go back
to my boring life of being an IT girl.

491
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,288
That's my offer.

492
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,650
Okay.

493
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,081
So I've been meaning to ask...

494
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,843
...is there a bathroom?
Because I've had to pee since I got here.

495
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,601
- It's upstairs to the left.
- Great.

496
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,006
Felicity.

497
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,011
Thank you.

498
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,844
Yeah.

499
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,531
Oliver,
I know you don't wanna hurt this girl...

500
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,684
...and you didn't have any choice
in telling her who you really were...

501
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,366
...but we're asking her to get involved
in some pretty dangerous stuff.

502
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,887
- We can protect her.
- How?

503
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:22,527
Your mother just shot you, Oliver.
You can't even keep yourself safe.

504
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,887
She was scared.
She was defending herself.

505
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,042
Or she was hiding something.

506
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,204
Like maybe her involvement
in Walter's disappearance or worse.

507
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:34,445
Diggle, we don't always know
why people do what they do.

508
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,050
But what I do know is that
when I was standing in her office...

509
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,043
...with an arrow aimed at her heart...

510
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:47,209
...she begged me to spare her,
all on behalf of me and Thea.

511
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:50,768
Now, I've taken down a lot
of bad people.

512
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,685
- None of them brought up their kids, Dig.
- Oliver, she had the list.

513
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:57,363
Now, she may not be in charge
of whatever it is...

514
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,842
- ...but she's definitely involved.
- Involved in what?

515
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,289
We don't even know what it is.

516
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,206
And until we do, she is off limits.

517
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,605
Am I clear?

518
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:27,006
But, Oliver, are you saying this
because you truly believe she's innocent...

519
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:31,611
...or because you don't wanna face the fact
that your mother might be guilty?

520
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:51,242
Six-one and a deep voice. I...

521
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,562
Hey. What's going on?

522
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,081
Where have you been?
I've been calling you all night.

523
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,288
I was at the club.
I get zero reception in there.

524
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,568
- Maybe it's time you invest in a landline.
- Thea.

525
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,246
Your mother was attacked last night.

526
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,890
- By the vigilante.
- What?

527
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,849
He came after me at the office.

528
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,241
- Did he hurt you? Are you okay?
- Actually she hurt him.

529
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,170
She shot him point-blank
with a gun hidden in her office.

530
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:17,048
That should help with your investigation. Did
you get any evidence? Like a blood sample...?

531
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:21,286
There was a screw-up at the lab.

532
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,566
That's too bad.

533
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,085
Mm.

534
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,329
We'll be in touch.

535
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,404
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

536
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:40,001
- Oh, sweetheart. I was so scared.
- I'm just glad you're okay.

537
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,561
I thought he was gonna kill me.

538
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,807
I promise you...

539
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,928
...he's never gonna bother you again.
