1
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,303
Yes, sir. I redrafted the contracts
to include the new stipulations.

2
00:02:30,304 --> 00:02:32,938
<i>- Then where are they?</i>
- I'm faxing the revisions now.

3
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:34,574
<i>Did you make all the
changes I asked for?</i>

4
00:02:34,575 --> 00:02:38,043
Yes. I included the four percent
increase and the extra 2 million.

5
00:02:38,044 --> 00:02:40,287
<i>No, no. If it's a four
percent increase then</i>

6
00:02:40,313 --> 00:02:42,281
<i>you have to add at least
3 million dollars.</i>

7
00:02:42,483 --> 00:02:44,950
No. No, that's not what I was told.

8
00:02:44,951 --> 00:02:46,419
<i>- Who told you that?</i>
- Their lawyers.

9
00:02:46,421 --> 00:02:50,423
<i>They're all idiots! I don't understand
this total lack of communication.</i>

10
00:02:50,425 --> 00:02:53,892
You know what? It's okay. I just
had no way of knowing, sir.

11
00:02:53,893 --> 00:02:55,261
<i>Look, this is what
I need you to do.</i>

12
00:02:55,262 --> 00:02:57,262
Sir, could I put you
on hold for a second?

13
00:02:57,288 --> 00:02:59,599
<i>- Okay.</i>
- Thanks. Hi, Jody.

14
00:02:59,825 --> 00:03:02,101
Mr. Harper wants to
see you in his office.

15
00:03:02,102 --> 00:03:04,637
- Great. Of course.
- Still want me to fax those?

16
00:03:04,638 --> 00:03:08,141
It's OK, you don't have to. I'm not
even done yet. You should go home.

17
00:03:08,142 --> 00:03:10,275
- Are you sure?
- It's late.

18
00:03:10,276 --> 00:03:13,212
I don't want your parents
to worry. Get out of here.

19
00:03:13,213 --> 00:03:16,916
- Okay. Merry Christmas, Angela.
- Merry Christmas, Jody.

20
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,231
Hi, Lorraine. Of course
I'm going to make it.

21
00:03:31,231 --> 00:03:33,674
Just let me call you back. Okay?

22
00:03:34,501 --> 00:03:38,515
In a few minutes, I promise. Okay.

23
00:03:38,938 --> 00:03:41,212
Still on the Morgan deal?

24
00:03:42,042 --> 00:03:44,178
What can I do for you, Jim?

25
00:03:44,344 --> 00:03:46,218
I...

26
00:03:48,182 --> 00:03:50,660
I don't know how to...

27
00:03:51,984 --> 00:03:55,188
Angela, I feel terrible
about what happened.

28
00:03:55,189 --> 00:03:58,558
It's OK. It's fine. Let's just
not worry about it, okay?

29
00:03:58,559 --> 00:04:03,403
No, it's not okay.
I acted like a real jerk.

30
00:04:03,496 --> 00:04:08,875
I had too many drinks and... You know
how these Christmas parties can be.

31
00:04:08,968 --> 00:04:11,776
We had a baby last year, and...

32
00:04:13,207 --> 00:04:15,583
It's been a hard year.

33
00:04:15,942 --> 00:04:17,475
I'm sure that it has.

34
00:04:17,476 --> 00:04:22,423
I simply want to tell you that
I'm really, really sorry. Okay?

35
00:04:22,782 --> 00:04:24,726
Apology accepted.

36
00:04:25,085 --> 00:04:29,689
Thanks. Merry Christmas, Angela.

37
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,565
You too, Jim.

38
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:47,206
<i>You calling me from work? Thought
you were going home first.</i>

39
00:04:47,207 --> 00:04:49,975
- I brought everything with me. Don't worry.
<i>- Get over here, Angie.</i>

40
00:04:49,976 --> 00:04:52,078
<i>God, I am so late with this dinner.</i>

41
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:54,714
<i>Did you pick up the Santa Claus
costume? I hope you didn't forget it.</i>

42
00:04:54,715 --> 00:04:57,116
I didn't forget it.
It's in the car.

43
00:04:57,117 --> 00:04:59,619
<i>I think Dad is more
excited than the kids.</i>

44
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,854
I can't wait to get out
of here and see you guys.

45
00:05:02,855 --> 00:05:05,224
<i>Jimmy, put that back.
We're having dinner soon.</i>

46
00:05:05,225 --> 00:05:08,493
<i>- You want Santa to come tonight or not?
- Mommy, I want Santa to come.</i>

47
00:05:08,494 --> 00:05:10,596
<i>Then help me set the table.</i>

48
00:05:10,597 --> 00:05:14,000
<i>- Please don't be late.</i>
- I won't. I promise.

49
00:05:14,001 --> 00:05:16,239
<i>- Okay, bye.</i>
- Bye.

50
00:05:21,108 --> 00:05:22,812
Okay.

51
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,286
- Oh, Jesus!
- My God!

52
00:06:04,951 --> 00:06:07,286
- Sorry, Angela...
- It's okay.

53
00:06:07,287 --> 00:06:10,056
I was just locking up the floors.
I didn't know anybody would be working

54
00:06:10,057 --> 00:06:11,791
this late on Christmas Eve.

55
00:06:11,792 --> 00:06:13,693
- Me neither.
- Sorry.

56
00:06:13,694 --> 00:06:15,828
I'll come back later, all right?

57
00:06:15,829 --> 00:06:18,664
Actually, if you wouldn't mind
waiting, I'll lock my office

58
00:06:18,665 --> 00:06:21,000
- and take the elevator down with you.
- Sure.

59
00:06:21,001 --> 00:06:22,908
Two seconds.

60
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,004
Do you work all night?

61
00:06:25,005 --> 00:06:28,407
Yeah, but they're closing the
building for the next three days.

62
00:06:28,408 --> 00:06:31,010
- Besides, I get New Year's Eve off.
- That's good.

63
00:06:31,011 --> 00:06:34,347
I hope to get home in time for the
girls to open up the presents.

64
00:06:34,348 --> 00:06:36,949
- How are they?
- Great.

65
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:41,253
- Your parents can't stand me.
- You're wrong. They love you.

66
00:06:41,254 --> 00:06:43,080
So, where are you
going this evening?

67
00:06:43,106 --> 00:06:45,291
I'm going to my
sister's house in Jersey.

68
00:06:45,292 --> 00:06:49,237
New Jersey? I thought of you
more as an Upper East Side girl.

69
00:06:49,462 --> 00:06:53,899
Upper east side of Maine,
actually. I grew up on a farm.

70
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,369
Now, I'm having trouble
believing that.

71
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:00,714
Hey, don't let the fancy clothes
fool you. I keep it real.

72
00:07:01,141 --> 00:07:03,776
Is that what you call it?
Keeping it real?

73
00:07:04,911 --> 00:07:07,046
- Goodnight, Karl.
- Merry Christmas, Angela.

74
00:07:07,047 --> 00:07:08,981
You too. I'll see you soon.

75
00:07:19,993 --> 00:07:22,896
I promise you
I'm leaving right now.

76
00:07:22,897 --> 00:07:26,204
I know. I'm sorry,
but I'm in the elevator.

77
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,273
Twenty-five minutes, tops.

78
00:07:29,668 --> 00:07:33,843
I can't hear you. What?
Lorraine, you're breaking up.

79
00:07:34,441 --> 00:07:36,247
Hello?

80
00:08:34,836 --> 00:08:38,143
You have got to be kidding.

81
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,587
Come on.

82
00:08:52,319 --> 00:08:55,092
Oh, God. What am I gonna do?

83
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,105
I'm getting out of the car
is what I'm gonna do.

84
00:09:32,058 --> 00:09:33,797
Oh, shit.

85
00:09:49,142 --> 00:09:50,848
Hello?

86
00:09:52,511 --> 00:09:53,578
Jesus!

87
00:09:53,579 --> 00:09:57,354
Rocky, what are you doing? Heel.

88
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:00,395
Stay. Down.

89
00:10:00,988 --> 00:10:03,822
- Sorry about that.
- It's okay.

90
00:10:03,823 --> 00:10:06,724
Look, can you unlock the
door to the elevator room?

91
00:10:06,725 --> 00:10:09,094
My car won't start, and I need
to get upstairs and get a cab.

92
00:10:09,095 --> 00:10:13,464
Yeah, I can. I've just got
to find my key cards.

93
00:10:13,465 --> 00:10:17,938
Sorry. Where are those darn keys?
I'm about to do my rounds anyway, so...

94
00:10:17,939 --> 00:10:20,605
- Okay, great.
- What happened to your car?

95
00:10:20,606 --> 00:10:23,876
- I have no idea.
- You probably left the lights on.

96
00:10:23,877 --> 00:10:26,879
I don't think so. I'm usually pretty
good about that kind of thing.

97
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,854
People do it all the time.
It's instinctive.

98
00:10:28,855 --> 00:10:31,852
You drive down here,
it's dark... It happens.

99
00:10:32,252 --> 00:10:33,352
Here we go.

100
00:10:33,353 --> 00:10:35,486
- Great.
- You know, actually...

101
00:10:35,487 --> 00:10:40,159
I have a charger in the back, so if it is
your battery probably you could use that.

102
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,730
Thank you, but... I really should
just take a cab. I'm so late as it is.

103
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:48,969
No, no. It would probably take longer
to get a cab. It's Christmas Eve.

104
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:53,074
So... I don't know. Up to you.
Whatever you want.

105
00:10:54,307 --> 00:10:58,048
- How long will it take?
- Just a few minutes.

106
00:11:02,049 --> 00:11:04,649
<i>Now with beautiful Metropolitan
Opera House in the background,</i>

107
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:07,820
<i>let's check out the temperatures
in the Tri-State Area.</i>

108
00:11:07,821 --> 00:11:11,323
- Which way to your car?
- Over there.

109
00:11:11,324 --> 00:11:13,097
Okay.

110
00:11:16,562 --> 00:11:19,110
Working late, huh?
I know how you feel.

111
00:11:20,067 --> 00:11:24,569
These are pretty reliable cars
for the most part, right?

112
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,878
They're supposed to be.

113
00:11:28,042 --> 00:11:31,349
All right. Positive...

114
00:11:32,846 --> 00:11:35,120
Negative.

115
00:11:37,684 --> 00:11:41,087
- All right, try it. Turn her over.
- Okay.

116
00:11:43,223 --> 00:11:44,962
Strange.

117
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:48,663
Hang on. Can you turn
your headlights on?

118
00:11:50,697 --> 00:11:53,835
Weird. Try turning the keys again.

119
00:11:54,934 --> 00:11:55,654
Damn it.

120
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:58,563
All right. I guess
turn the headlights off.

121
00:11:59,205 --> 00:12:00,943
You know what?

122
00:12:00,974 --> 00:12:05,210
That's it. You've been a
great help, but I give up.

123
00:12:05,211 --> 00:12:09,314
Sorry. I don't know what happened.
I thought I could do something.

124
00:12:09,315 --> 00:12:13,652
You've been great. Could you just
let me in the elevator room now?

125
00:12:13,653 --> 00:12:15,756
I was just trying to help.

126
00:12:16,356 --> 00:12:20,335
I know. And I appreciate it.
Thank you.

127
00:12:28,035 --> 00:12:32,014
Hey, I know you're upset about
your car not starting, but...

128
00:12:32,073 --> 00:12:34,940
It's the holidays.
It's time to be thankful.

129
00:12:34,941 --> 00:12:36,541
You know what? You're right.

130
00:12:36,542 --> 00:12:38,748
- Yeah?
- I should be thankful.

131
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,163
I, uh...

132
00:12:49,255 --> 00:12:52,324
I prepared a small
Christmas meal for myself.

133
00:12:52,325 --> 00:12:56,100
You could join me if you want.

134
00:12:58,832 --> 00:13:03,268
- I'm just kidding.
- Oh, sorry. I'm exhausted.

135
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:05,611
But thanks for your help.

136
00:13:05,638 --> 00:13:08,539
You're welcome.
Maybe some other time?

137
00:13:09,642 --> 00:13:11,688
Sure.

138
00:13:11,911 --> 00:13:13,612
All right.

139
00:13:13,613 --> 00:13:16,448
Here you go. You sure you don't
want me to call you a cab?

140
00:13:16,449 --> 00:13:19,852
- No. I've got a number in my bag.
- Suit yourself. Merry Christmas.

141
00:13:19,853 --> 00:13:21,557
Merry Christmas.

142
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,975
Karl?

143
00:14:02,562 --> 00:14:06,405
Hi. Can I get a car at
2370 Park Avenue, please?

144
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,114
Are you sure? No, that's okay.
I'll wait. Thanks.

145
00:14:22,649 --> 00:14:28,256
Lorraine, you won't believe what
happened. No, my car wouldn't start.

146
00:14:28,588 --> 00:14:30,658
Just start without me,

147
00:14:30,784 --> 00:14:34,456
and I'll be there within the hour
and I'll make it up to them.

148
00:14:35,028 --> 00:14:38,507
Okay. I'll see you soon. Bye.

149
00:15:33,387 --> 00:15:38,025
Hello? Oh, great. Thank you!

150
00:15:38,124 --> 00:15:41,102
Okay. Okay.

151
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:48,538
Oh, come on.

152
00:15:49,435 --> 00:15:51,036
What?

153
00:15:52,339 --> 00:15:58,287
This is not happening. Is this a joke?
God, no, you gotta be kidding me.

154
00:15:58,444 --> 00:16:02,720
Karl? Where are you?
Is anybody here?

155
00:16:03,216 --> 00:16:05,694
Come on, come on, come on.

156
00:16:13,693 --> 00:16:15,637
What?

157
00:16:16,996 --> 00:16:20,771
One second, okay? I'll be
right back. Just one second.

158
00:16:39,454 --> 00:16:41,387
<i>Hello, can you hear me?</i>

159
00:16:41,388 --> 00:16:46,060
<i>I've got a cab waiting for me.
Can you open the front gate, please?</i>

160
00:16:46,293 --> 00:16:47,826
<i>Hello?</i>

161
00:16:49,629 --> 00:16:52,267
No... Wait!

162
00:16:54,335 --> 00:16:57,881
No! Damn it! Why would
you leave me here?

163
00:17:05,645 --> 00:17:08,351
Wake up! The cab just left.

164
00:17:29,802 --> 00:17:33,008
Hey! I'm still in here! Wait!

165
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,257
Great.

166
00:17:56,763 --> 00:17:59,537
It's okay.

167
00:18:09,242 --> 00:18:11,048
Hello?

168
00:18:13,646 --> 00:18:16,248
Stop being paranoid.

169
00:18:19,052 --> 00:18:21,531
Go down to the office.

170
00:19:01,027 --> 00:19:02,800
Hello?

171
00:19:18,512 --> 00:19:20,682
Oh, fuck!

172
00:20:44,264 --> 00:20:49,438
Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
You've been a good little girl.

173
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:57,113
Wait. It's okay.
You're all right. Okay?

174
00:20:57,611 --> 00:20:59,417
All right?

175
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:05,125
You're not looking so good. Are
you okay? Take it easy. It's okay.

176
00:21:09,021 --> 00:21:14,001
- What happened to me? What time is it?
- You just fell. You'll be all right.

177
00:21:15,494 --> 00:21:18,463
I don't feel good.
I'm going to be sick.

178
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:21,272
I'll get you some water.

179
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:27,978
Be careful! You're gonna hurt
yourself. Try to stay calm.

180
00:21:29,842 --> 00:21:31,854
Okay.

181
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:37,888
It's okay. Here. Okay?

182
00:21:40,052 --> 00:21:43,689
I'm going to help you up, okay?

183
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:45,736
Here we go.

184
00:21:47,827 --> 00:21:50,462
There you go. It's okay.

185
00:21:50,463 --> 00:21:55,479
All right. Try to relax
while I clean this up.

186
00:21:56,403 --> 00:21:58,174
Okay.

187
00:22:05,845 --> 00:22:09,552
Clean this up. Okay.

188
00:22:17,056 --> 00:22:20,159
All right. I'll be right back.

189
00:22:33,572 --> 00:22:38,349
Hungry? I've got turkey,

190
00:22:38,511 --> 00:22:43,322
mashed potatoes, cranberries,
and I've even got some cornbread.

191
00:22:46,253 --> 00:22:51,199
Oh, man. I'm sorry about this.
I was just teasing.

192
00:22:51,624 --> 00:22:54,227
I didn't mean to scare you.

193
00:22:57,831 --> 00:23:00,967
I hope it's still warm.

194
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:06,444
If not, I have a microwave.

195
00:23:08,709 --> 00:23:11,220
Are you feeling any better?

196
00:23:12,779 --> 00:23:15,154
What happened to my clothes?

197
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:20,921
Like I said, you fell and
your clothes got dirty...

198
00:23:24,924 --> 00:23:28,903
Maybe you'd like some wine.

199
00:23:29,662 --> 00:23:32,131
Help you relax a
little bit, you know?

200
00:23:32,132 --> 00:23:36,145
I don't know what you're doing, but
you'd better just fucking untie me.

201
00:23:40,173 --> 00:23:42,685
This is a California wine.

202
00:23:43,143 --> 00:23:46,314
It's Sonoma County.
That's where I'm from.

203
00:23:46,545 --> 00:23:48,988
It's beautiful up there.

204
00:23:51,951 --> 00:23:54,087
Where are you from?

205
00:23:57,391 --> 00:24:01,234
- What do you want?
- I want to know where you're from.

206
00:24:03,929 --> 00:24:06,271
I'm from Readfield.

207
00:24:07,167 --> 00:24:12,010
- Readfield. Where's that?
- Please, tell me what you want.

208
00:24:13,005 --> 00:24:18,180
I just want to know where Readfield
is. And I want you to relax.

209
00:24:34,527 --> 00:24:36,402
Cheers.

210
00:24:37,864 --> 00:24:42,600
I'll make a toast. Here's to
good friends and hometowns

211
00:24:42,601 --> 00:24:46,206
and Readfield. Wherever that is.

212
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:53,611
- Listen...
- Tom.

213
00:24:53,612 --> 00:24:55,419
Tom.

214
00:24:56,549 --> 00:25:01,353
I have someplace to be.
I have obligations.

215
00:25:01,354 --> 00:25:05,629
Yeah. I know. Way too many.

216
00:25:05,826 --> 00:25:10,568
You need time for yourself. You don't
need to be at everyone's beck and call.

217
00:25:13,732 --> 00:25:17,337
Then maybe we should get
a drink in the new year.

218
00:25:19,272 --> 00:25:24,310
I've already prepared
everything. It's all here.

219
00:25:24,311 --> 00:25:26,979
I know, and it looks really good.

220
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:30,816
Yeah? Great. Well, let's eat.

221
00:25:30,817 --> 00:25:32,318
I'm starving.

222
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:35,321
Tom, this is really sweet
of you, and I mean that.

223
00:25:35,322 --> 00:25:37,890
But my whole family is
expecting me. I have plans.

224
00:25:37,891 --> 00:25:40,698
I guess some plans are
made to be broken.

225
00:25:43,864 --> 00:25:46,740
Do you want to say
grace or should I?

226
00:25:49,302 --> 00:25:54,180
Hell, let's skip it. I've never
been religious anyway.

227
00:25:56,176 --> 00:25:58,050
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

228
00:26:04,184 --> 00:26:06,388
What do you like to do?

229
00:26:09,222 --> 00:26:12,735
After work and stuff?
I guess, hobbies.

230
00:26:12,791 --> 00:26:16,128
That's a mundane question,
but I guess people ask that

231
00:26:16,129 --> 00:26:18,596
just to get to know
each other, right?

232
00:26:18,597 --> 00:26:24,147
I read. Right now I'm reading
Hemingway, The Sun Also Rises.

233
00:26:24,637 --> 00:26:29,984
And you really should eat.
It's gonna get cold.

234
00:26:30,911 --> 00:26:35,948
Anyway, in the book this guy
loves this girl so much

235
00:26:35,949 --> 00:26:40,759
that he's willing to forgive
everything that she does.

236
00:26:40,954 --> 00:26:44,001
Even her infidelities.

237
00:26:44,958 --> 00:26:47,731
That's a pretty
intense story, but...

238
00:26:48,895 --> 00:26:51,668
That's what love is
supposed to be, right?

239
00:26:56,436 --> 00:27:00,882
My boyfriend is gonna get worried
and come looking for me, Tom.

240
00:27:10,783 --> 00:27:12,817
If I don't show up,
he'll come looking for me.

241
00:27:12,818 --> 00:27:14,898
He knows where I work.

242
00:27:18,891 --> 00:27:22,905
How long have you guys been
dating or hanging out?

243
00:27:23,762 --> 00:27:26,274
- Two years.
- Two years?

244
00:27:28,168 --> 00:27:32,443
- Do you live together?
- That's none of your fucking business.

245
00:27:33,872 --> 00:27:36,817
That's not very nice dinner talk.

246
00:27:38,311 --> 00:27:41,017
Yeah, we live together, okay?

247
00:27:45,285 --> 00:27:47,262
Two years...

248
00:27:48,089 --> 00:27:53,926
That's more than a boyfriend.
That sounds like wedding bells.

249
00:27:53,927 --> 00:27:56,098
Do you have any plans?

250
00:27:56,429 --> 00:28:00,909
- Yes.
- What does your fiancé do?

251
00:28:01,533 --> 00:28:02,867
He's a journalist.

252
00:28:02,868 --> 00:28:06,671
I knew he had to be smart.
What kind of journalist?

253
00:28:06,672 --> 00:28:09,341
- Sports.
- What paper?

254
00:28:09,342 --> 00:28:11,343
<i>- Post.</i>
- I read <i>The Post.</i>

255
00:28:11,344 --> 00:28:13,645
- What's his name?
- Mark Clayton.

256
00:28:13,646 --> 00:28:18,320
Clayton. I don't
remember that name.

257
00:28:20,253 --> 00:28:25,427
- I have one over here.
- It's <i>The Post</i> online.

258
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:36,373
It's amazing

259
00:28:36,403 --> 00:28:40,638
that you're able to keep a relationship
with the amount of hours you work.

260
00:28:40,639 --> 00:28:45,121
He must get really lonely when
you have to work late, right?

261
00:28:47,313 --> 00:28:49,324
Do you love him?

262
00:28:50,151 --> 00:28:52,320
Does he love you?

263
00:28:57,158 --> 00:29:02,297
I'm only asking because I'm worried about
how quickly he's going to get here.

264
00:29:03,329 --> 00:29:06,273
I'm sure he's already on his way.

265
00:29:09,903 --> 00:29:14,373
Right. He's probably on the
Harlem River Drive as we speak.

266
00:29:14,374 --> 00:29:16,674
- What kind of car does he drive?
- I don't know.

267
00:29:16,675 --> 00:29:18,911
You don't know what kind
of car your fiancé drives?

268
00:29:18,912 --> 00:29:23,961
- Toyota, I think.
- Toyota. That is a fast car.

269
00:29:24,051 --> 00:29:27,097
He can be here a lot sooner
than I was thinking.

270
00:29:27,586 --> 00:29:30,690
He could be coming down
this ramp right now.

271
00:29:39,631 --> 00:29:43,645
You haven't been very
talkative since we met.

272
00:29:45,671 --> 00:29:50,345
But now you're telling me all about

273
00:29:51,377 --> 00:29:55,084
your boyfriend.
Oh, sorry, your fiancé.

274
00:29:56,217 --> 00:30:01,856
So either we've become best friends
over dinner or you're lying to me.

275
00:30:02,856 --> 00:30:04,764
I'm guessing

276
00:30:05,259 --> 00:30:07,360
you're lying to me.

277
00:30:11,397 --> 00:30:14,307
You don't really have
a boyfriend, do you?

278
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,871
But you want one.

279
00:30:17,971 --> 00:30:22,348
You want somebody who
cares about you...

280
00:30:23,443 --> 00:30:27,645
- Worries about you...
- Please, don't.

281
00:30:27,646 --> 00:30:31,092
You've got a great family.

282
00:30:32,484 --> 00:30:35,087
You've got Lorraine.

283
00:30:35,889 --> 00:30:39,493
Jimmy and Rose. They love you.

284
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,732
They're probably getting
worried about you.

285
00:30:45,865 --> 00:30:48,968
Maybe we should give
them a call. Yeah?

286
00:30:49,601 --> 00:30:51,875
Tell them you're okay.

287
00:30:53,505 --> 00:30:55,744
What do you think?

288
00:31:09,823 --> 00:31:12,165
What should we say?

289
00:31:13,725 --> 00:31:17,695
I know. We should say
you made other plans.

290
00:31:17,696 --> 00:31:20,971
No. You probably
already said that one.

291
00:31:21,168 --> 00:31:24,441
You know what? You should
think of something.

292
00:31:25,206 --> 00:31:27,308
You're a good liar.

293
00:31:28,408 --> 00:31:30,419
Go ahead.

294
00:31:31,911 --> 00:31:33,717
Go!

295
00:31:33,813 --> 00:31:35,585
No.

296
00:31:48,262 --> 00:31:52,030
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

297
00:31:52,031 --> 00:31:56,369
Hey, Rosie. Can you get
your mommy on the phone?

298
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:58,539
<i>Who's calling, please?</i>

299
00:31:59,138 --> 00:32:02,947
- It's Auntie Angie.
<i>- Mommy, it's Aunt Angie.</i>

300
00:32:03,409 --> 00:32:07,115
<i>Give me a second, okay?
Hey, where are you?</i>

301
00:32:07,579 --> 00:32:10,514
<i>- Angela?</i>
- I'm not feeling well.

302
00:32:10,515 --> 00:32:13,353
<i>What do you mean?
We're all waiting for you.</i>

303
00:32:13,354 --> 00:32:14,920
<i>She says she's not feeling well.</i>

304
00:32:14,921 --> 00:32:19,124
<i>- That's what she said the last time.
- Can I talk to my sister, please?</i>

305
00:32:19,125 --> 00:32:20,491
<i>Where are you, Angie?</i>

306
00:32:20,492 --> 00:32:23,073
<i>She's got a real job.
It's not like...</i>

307
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:25,101
<i>Angela?</i>

308
00:32:25,698 --> 00:32:28,700
I went home.

309
00:32:28,701 --> 00:32:30,869
<i>What's wrong? Where is she?</i>

310
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:32,938
<i>I don't understand. Last
time I talked to you,</i>

311
00:32:32,939 --> 00:32:35,807
<i>you were on your way.
What about the costume?</i>

312
00:32:35,808 --> 00:32:39,211
<i>Let's just eat. You should
know your sister by now.</i>

313
00:32:39,212 --> 00:32:40,478
<i>It would be nice if you'd try</i>

314
00:32:40,479 --> 00:32:42,447
<i>and put your family ahead
of your work sometimes.</i>

315
00:32:42,448 --> 00:32:44,750
<i>That's enough. Give me the phone.</i>

316
00:32:44,751 --> 00:32:47,024
<i>Angie, what's wrong?</i>

317
00:32:47,921 --> 00:32:51,455
<i>Hello? I can't hear her.</i>

318
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:54,192
<i>Sweetie? Can you hear me?</i>

319
00:32:54,193 --> 00:32:58,833
- Hi, Mom. I'm here.
<i>- Honey, what happened? Where are you?</i>

320
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,377
I don't know.

321
00:33:02,369 --> 00:33:04,102
I think it's the flu.

322
00:33:04,103 --> 00:33:08,777
<i>You really sound terrible.
Are you sure you're okay?</i>

323
00:33:09,276 --> 00:33:14,153
Yeah. I just need some rest.

324
00:33:14,448 --> 00:33:16,048
<i>Okay.</i>

325
00:33:16,049 --> 00:33:20,118
<i>Rest up and hopefully you'll
feel better for lunch tomorrow.</i>

326
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:23,563
<i>And don't worry about
the costume, okay?</i>

327
00:33:23,622 --> 00:33:28,228
<i>- Merry Christmas, angel. I love you.</i>
- I love you too, Mom.

328
00:33:39,973 --> 00:33:43,520
That was the best Christmas
present anyone's ever given me.

329
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:47,050
Thank you.

330
00:33:47,981 --> 00:33:50,857
And now I have a present for you.

331
00:34:12,604 --> 00:34:14,480
Go ahead.

332
00:34:15,376 --> 00:34:17,045
Open it.

333
00:34:20,347 --> 00:34:22,756
Aren't you even curious?

334
00:34:23,149 --> 00:34:25,524
Open it.

335
00:34:28,187 --> 00:34:30,266
Yes.

336
00:34:40,666 --> 00:34:42,300
Bet you're curious now.

337
00:34:44,203 --> 00:34:46,511
Okay. Enough torture.

338
00:34:51,277 --> 00:34:54,586
Watch. It's all cued up.

339
00:34:59,185 --> 00:35:02,356
- Why are you showing this to me?
- Wait.

340
00:35:29,482 --> 00:35:32,654
You fucked up now, asshole.

341
00:35:35,621 --> 00:35:38,064
Sorry you had to see that.

342
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:46,066
You want to go for a stroll?

343
00:35:51,003 --> 00:35:56,177
These guys always do
whatever they want.

344
00:36:02,181 --> 00:36:04,021
Here we go.

345
00:36:08,455 --> 00:36:10,897
Rocky, sit down!

346
00:36:22,603 --> 00:36:25,011
Why did you do that?

347
00:36:28,941 --> 00:36:31,523
Rocky, shut the fuck up!

348
00:36:34,615 --> 00:36:36,181
- Let me help you up.
- Don't.

349
00:36:36,182 --> 00:36:38,984
- Don't touch me!
- I'm not gonna hurt you. All right?

350
00:36:38,985 --> 00:36:40,085
You're hurting my arm.

351
00:36:40,086 --> 00:36:43,223
That's because you won't
relax your arms. Okay?

352
00:36:46,826 --> 00:36:49,694
- Come on.
- Just let me go. I won't tell anyone.

353
00:36:49,695 --> 00:36:53,709
Yeah, I believe you. I just
need to show you something.

354
00:37:10,517 --> 00:37:13,621
Let's put that all behind us, yeah?

355
00:37:14,287 --> 00:37:16,992
Here we go.

356
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:31,614
Uh-oh.

357
00:37:32,038 --> 00:37:35,050
I think I drank too much wine.

358
00:37:35,775 --> 00:37:38,550
I really shouldn't be driving.

359
00:37:40,513 --> 00:37:42,526
I'm just kidding.

360
00:37:47,454 --> 00:37:50,488
You know, I've seen you drive
out of here so many times.

361
00:37:50,489 --> 00:37:53,662
Strange being in the car with you.

362
00:37:54,994 --> 00:37:56,928
It's great, actually.

363
00:37:56,929 --> 00:37:58,900
I thought you said we
were taking a drive.

364
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:00,528
We are.

365
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,673
Then why are we going down, Tom?

366
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:06,615
It's freezing out there.

367
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,847
Besides, this is gonna
be much better.

368
00:38:20,687 --> 00:38:23,163
Why are we down here, Thomas?

369
00:38:25,124 --> 00:38:26,795
Tom?

370
00:38:45,911 --> 00:38:48,081
Oh, my God, Tom.

371
00:38:48,649 --> 00:38:50,989
What is this?

372
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:53,659
This is my present to you.

373
00:39:03,496 --> 00:39:07,873
I want you to take
this and show him.

374
00:39:09,602 --> 00:39:11,706
Show him what?

375
00:39:12,305 --> 00:39:14,740
Show him you're not a slut.

376
00:39:14,741 --> 00:39:19,345
Take this and teach him he can't
be touching every woman he wants.

377
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,115
Are you talking about what
happened in the elevator?

378
00:39:24,116 --> 00:39:28,353
Oh, Tom, no. You don't
understand. That was a mistake.

379
00:39:28,354 --> 00:39:30,055
A stupid mistake.

380
00:39:30,056 --> 00:39:33,136
- What? He tried to rape you.
- No.

381
00:39:33,259 --> 00:39:36,762
He got a little out of hand at a party,
Tom. He hardly tried to rape me.

382
00:39:36,763 --> 00:39:41,139
Look, he was drunk. He apologized.

383
00:39:41,634 --> 00:39:44,339
Oh, he apologized.

384
00:39:44,438 --> 00:39:46,971
You think you're the first
woman he tried to do this to?

385
00:39:46,972 --> 00:39:49,574
I've seen him try to touch
every woman in the building.

386
00:39:49,575 --> 00:39:53,589
- He's a pervert. A degenerate.
- No.

387
00:39:54,448 --> 00:39:56,782
He's a good man, Tom.

388
00:39:56,783 --> 00:40:01,619
Look at him. He has a family.
He has a wife. Tom, please don't.

389
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:04,923
Tom, Tom... Stop calling
out my name, all right?

390
00:40:04,924 --> 00:40:06,524
I know what you're trying to do.

391
00:40:06,525 --> 00:40:09,127
You're trying to humanize yourself,
like you're some poor victim.

392
00:40:09,128 --> 00:40:12,997
I told you, I'm not gonna
hurt you! All right?

393
00:40:12,998 --> 00:40:15,401
Stop calling out my name!
Enough's enough!

394
00:40:15,402 --> 00:40:18,948
Tom, Tom, Tom! How many
times can you say it?

395
00:40:19,004 --> 00:40:20,778
Okay.

396
00:40:29,648 --> 00:40:33,195
I know you're a person, okay?

397
00:40:33,387 --> 00:40:35,330
I'm a person, too.

398
00:40:35,688 --> 00:40:39,201
I know you have feelings.
I have feelings, too.

399
00:40:40,327 --> 00:40:42,839
I care about your feelings.

400
00:40:43,095 --> 00:40:48,702
He's the one you should be scared of.
He's the one who has no feelings.

401
00:40:49,736 --> 00:40:52,281
So if you want to help him,

402
00:40:53,205 --> 00:40:56,912
take this and teach him a lesson.

403
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:05,719
I told you, he apologized.

404
00:41:05,819 --> 00:41:08,754
What? He can just apologize
and then he can do it again?

405
00:41:08,755 --> 00:41:10,688
And then he's just gonna
apologize again and then...

406
00:41:10,689 --> 00:41:13,091
You've got to stop letting these
assholes have their way with you!

407
00:41:13,092 --> 00:41:18,029
Tom, please believe me. It was
just a misunderstanding, Tom.

408
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:23,136
Tom, Tom! Just stop calling
out my name! I told you!

409
00:41:23,469 --> 00:41:27,073
- Didn't I?
- Yes! Yes.

410
00:41:27,573 --> 00:41:32,212
- I'm sorry, but you're scaring me.
- Jesus! When are you gonna understand?

411
00:41:34,013 --> 00:41:37,618
I'm here to help you.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

412
00:41:50,696 --> 00:41:52,605
Okay.

413
00:41:55,869 --> 00:41:57,709
I'll do it.

414
00:41:59,339 --> 00:42:01,885
You untie me and I'll do it.

415
00:42:07,981 --> 00:42:12,027
No. Oh, no. Whoa.

416
00:42:12,051 --> 00:42:14,723
You're a good person.

417
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,488
You're a good person, too.

418
00:42:16,489 --> 00:42:19,325
I should have never asked
you to do this. I'm sorry.

419
00:42:19,326 --> 00:42:24,363
No. It's okay because I want to.

420
00:42:24,364 --> 00:42:29,709
You just have to untie me
and I'll do it for you.

421
00:42:39,346 --> 00:42:41,914
No, no. It's my job to protect you.

422
00:42:41,915 --> 00:42:46,318
No, Tom, listen to me. It's not.
Please don't do anything.

423
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:48,523
Don't try to run away, okay?

424
00:42:49,054 --> 00:42:50,998
Can I trust you?

425
00:42:52,791 --> 00:42:55,064
- Can I trust you?
- Yes.

426
00:42:55,594 --> 00:42:57,902
You can trust me.

427
00:43:01,301 --> 00:43:05,610
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry.

428
00:43:08,308 --> 00:43:10,012
So...

429
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:13,554
You like to touch girls, do you?

430
00:43:14,113 --> 00:43:17,125
No? Look at her.

431
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:19,623
I said look at her.

432
00:43:21,922 --> 00:43:25,123
Does she look happy to you? Huh?

433
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,265
Yeah.

434
00:43:29,728 --> 00:43:32,536
You messed with the wrong girl.

435
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:37,542
What makes you think
you deserve her? Huh?

436
00:43:37,603 --> 00:43:39,911
What gives you the right?

437
00:43:40,506 --> 00:43:42,908
You're something else,
you know that?

438
00:43:42,909 --> 00:43:48,116
You pretentious Ivy
League piece of shit.

439
00:43:48,681 --> 00:43:51,649
You don't own the world
and everyone in it.

440
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:54,819
What is a guy like you thinking when
he puts his hands all over a girl

441
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:59,494
who obviously is not interested?
Who is obviously not a slut?

442
00:44:00,626 --> 00:44:03,262
Because that's what you
think they are, right?

443
00:44:03,263 --> 00:44:07,032
Yeah? I can't hear you.
What did you say?

444
00:44:07,033 --> 00:44:09,901
What? Can you speak up?

445
00:44:09,902 --> 00:44:14,246
Because you can't talk your
way out of this one, can you?

446
00:44:14,941 --> 00:44:17,224
Why am I even wasting
my time with you?

447
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:18,870
No!

448
00:44:19,112 --> 00:44:23,922
- What? Angela, he deserves it!
- Don't do anything, Thomas, please!

449
00:44:39,832 --> 00:44:41,503
No!

450
00:44:43,569 --> 00:44:46,047
Stop it! Stop it!

451
00:45:04,523 --> 00:45:07,297
Way to ruin Christmas, asshole.

452
00:45:22,941 --> 00:45:26,245
Well, he won't be
bothering you again.

453
00:45:26,246 --> 00:45:28,347
Where are we going?

454
00:45:28,348 --> 00:45:32,118
We can't just leave him here.
You have to get him.

455
00:45:32,119 --> 00:45:34,253
What? Why are you defending him?

456
00:45:34,254 --> 00:45:36,721
I'm not. I'm not.

457
00:45:36,722 --> 00:45:39,391
Do you like this? Do you
like to get touched?

458
00:45:39,392 --> 00:45:41,492
You like it when he touches
you in the parking garage?

459
00:45:41,493 --> 00:45:44,164
- Do you want to get laid here?
- You know that's not true.

460
00:45:44,165 --> 00:45:48,211
So what is it? A career thing?

461
00:45:48,534 --> 00:45:51,978
Did you fuck him to
get a promotion?

462
00:45:52,905 --> 00:45:55,111
We can't leave him here.

463
00:45:57,976 --> 00:46:01,649
You're right. I'm sorry.

464
00:46:02,648 --> 00:46:05,320
We shouldn't leave him here.

465
00:46:05,884 --> 00:46:08,420
Wait! Thomas, stop!

466
00:46:12,791 --> 00:46:13,831
What are you doing?

467
00:46:13,832 --> 00:46:16,728
We're gonna just take
him for a little drive.

468
00:46:16,729 --> 00:46:21,101
What are you doing?
Tom, stop the car! Please!

469
00:46:21,102 --> 00:46:23,873
Please stop! Please!

470
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:28,450
Stop it! What are
you doing, Tom? No!

471
00:46:30,976 --> 00:46:32,817
No! No!

472
00:46:33,746 --> 00:46:36,418
Oh. my God!

473
00:46:38,617 --> 00:46:42,754
No, please! Oh, my God!
Don't do this.

474
00:46:42,755 --> 00:46:46,269
Please don't! No!

475
00:46:53,499 --> 00:46:55,201
Thomas, no.

476
00:46:55,202 --> 00:46:59,181
You're a good person, Thomas.
Please don't do this.

477
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:05,786
No! God, no! Stop it!

478
00:47:09,116 --> 00:47:10,988
Hey! Hey!

479
00:47:12,885 --> 00:47:15,090
Where are you going?

480
00:47:17,090 --> 00:47:20,603
Angela! Come back!

481
00:47:20,659 --> 00:47:24,208
You fucked him, didn't you? Liar!

482
00:47:50,455 --> 00:47:53,468
Hey! Down here!

483
00:47:54,726 --> 00:47:57,932
Can you hear me? Help!

484
00:48:01,867 --> 00:48:04,879
Down here! Can't you hear me?

485
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:36,633
Good boy.

486
00:49:50,009 --> 00:49:53,386
Sit. Good boy.

487
00:49:54,479 --> 00:49:58,290
Stay right there, Rocky.

488
00:50:25,644 --> 00:50:27,350
Stay there.

489
00:50:56,675 --> 00:51:00,850
Help me! Help me, please!

490
00:51:04,217 --> 00:51:09,766
Help me, please! Someone's
trying to kill me! Help me!

491
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:13,724
Help me!

492
00:51:13,725 --> 00:51:17,739
Somebody's trying to kill me!

493
00:51:18,464 --> 00:51:21,101
Oh, Karl. Where are you?

494
00:51:21,868 --> 00:51:23,572
Oh, my God.

495
00:52:23,830 --> 00:52:25,774
Angela?

496
00:52:26,199 --> 00:52:28,934
Please. If anyone can hear me...

497
00:52:28,935 --> 00:52:32,571
I'm trapped in the underground parking
structure of the Arcadia Building.

498
00:52:32,572 --> 00:52:35,507
It's 2370 Park Avenue.

499
00:52:35,508 --> 00:52:36,740
Someone's trying to kill me.

500
00:52:36,741 --> 00:52:38,650
Angela.

501
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:42,716
Angela, come out.

502
00:52:43,082 --> 00:52:44,682
Shit.

503
00:52:44,683 --> 00:52:47,127
Angela?

504
00:52:50,790 --> 00:52:53,097
Can we talk about this?

505
00:52:58,231 --> 00:53:01,779
Looks like somebody's
playing games, huh, Rocky?

506
00:53:09,642 --> 00:53:11,483
Angela?

507
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:16,280
Come on.

508
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:24,583
Come on. Lobby.
Come on. Lobby. Come on.

509
00:54:24,584 --> 00:54:27,027
Why is it fucking locked?

510
00:54:30,488 --> 00:54:32,261
Angela!

511
00:54:38,831 --> 00:54:40,673
Hello?

512
00:54:42,802 --> 00:54:45,576
Hello? Can anyone hear me?

513
00:55:13,833 --> 00:55:16,101
Please, hello?

514
00:55:16,102 --> 00:55:18,443
Answer, please?

515
00:55:19,238 --> 00:55:22,684
<i>Yes? Five Brothers
Security here. Hello?</i>

516
00:55:25,011 --> 00:55:28,280
Yes. I'm here. Can you hear me?

517
00:55:28,281 --> 00:55:30,683
<i>I can hear you fine.
How can I help you?</i>

518
00:55:30,684 --> 00:55:34,219
I'm being kidnapped. I work at
Brieter, Smith and Steinberg.

519
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:35,954
It's 2370 Park Avenue

520
00:55:35,955 --> 00:55:38,356
and I'm hiding in the elevator.
Please can you call 911?

521
00:55:38,357 --> 00:55:41,960
<i>Calm down, miss. Is there
someone with you right now?</i>

522
00:55:41,961 --> 00:55:46,331
No, he's outside in the parking lot.
He already killed someone else.

523
00:55:46,332 --> 00:55:47,633
<i>Did you see him do it?</i>

524
00:55:47,634 --> 00:55:51,036
Yes! His name is Thomas and he's the
parking attendant in my building.

525
00:55:51,037 --> 00:55:53,338
If you'll just please
hurry. I'm in danger.

526
00:55:53,339 --> 00:55:56,473
<i>Ma'am, you have got to relax
and take a deep breath.</i>

527
00:55:56,474 --> 00:55:59,844
How do you fucking expect me to
relax? This man is trying to kill me!

528
00:55:59,845 --> 00:56:03,749
Can you please try to
understand and call the cops?

529
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:06,886
Please just call 911!

530
00:56:08,354 --> 00:56:10,160
<i>The police?</i>

531
00:56:10,623 --> 00:56:14,729
<i>No. I'm sure he's just
trying to help you.</i>

532
00:56:16,494 --> 00:56:18,267
<i>Right?</i>

533
00:56:19,031 --> 00:56:20,737
<i>Angela?</i>

534
00:56:22,467 --> 00:56:24,911
<i>Are you still there?</i>

535
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:29,574
Listen you fuck-face, I called the
cops and I'm gonna stay down here

536
00:56:29,575 --> 00:56:33,912
as long as it takes until they get here,
so I suggest that you get the fuck out!

537
00:56:33,913 --> 00:56:36,314
<i>I just wanna talk to you.</i>

538
00:56:36,315 --> 00:56:41,057
<i>That's why I pretended to be someone
else, okay? So don't be upset.</i>

539
00:56:41,153 --> 00:56:44,356
<i>Will you come out?
I was just kidding.</i>

540
00:56:44,357 --> 00:56:46,424
Just go to hell!

541
00:56:46,425 --> 00:56:52,338
<i>Don't you understand? I did it for you.
That guy showed you no respect.</i>

542
00:56:54,433 --> 00:56:57,206
<i>Why won't you talk to me, Angela?</i>

543
00:56:58,404 --> 00:57:00,643
<i>Just give me a chance.</i>

544
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:06,589
<i>If you just give us a
chance, it can work out.</i>

545
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,080
<i>You'll grow to like me.</i>

546
00:57:09,081 --> 00:57:11,482
<i>That's usually what
happens when two people</i>

547
00:57:11,483 --> 00:57:14,919
<i>are forced to be together
in a stressful situation.</i>

548
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:19,691
<i>They have to depend on one another.
And eventually they support each other.</i>

549
00:57:19,692 --> 00:57:24,138
<i>They like each other. Sometimes
they even fall in love.</i>

550
00:57:27,199 --> 00:57:29,039
<i>Angela.</i>

551
00:57:29,969 --> 00:57:33,642
<i>Please don't do this.</i>

552
00:57:36,242 --> 00:57:38,790
<i>Why won't you talk to me?</i>

553
00:57:41,614 --> 00:57:46,721
<i>You know, I wish you had just a
little bit more respect for yourself.</i>

554
00:59:27,686 --> 00:59:30,961
I'm not coming out! Do you hear me?

555
00:59:31,824 --> 00:59:35,200
I'm not fucking moving, you fuck!

556
01:00:29,782 --> 01:00:33,057
Karl! Oh, no, please.

557
01:00:56,642 --> 01:00:58,517
Karl!

558
01:01:00,779 --> 01:01:04,384
Come on, Karl!

559
01:01:33,779 --> 01:01:35,654
Angela?

560
01:01:39,452 --> 01:01:42,430
You must be freezing out here.

561
01:01:43,089 --> 01:01:44,894
Angela.

562
01:01:56,136 --> 01:01:58,147
What a mess.

563
01:02:03,809 --> 01:02:05,582
Angela.

564
01:02:07,246 --> 01:02:09,690
I think Karl is hurt.

565
01:02:11,117 --> 01:02:15,494
Angela? Should we call
him an ambulance?

566
01:02:17,856 --> 01:02:23,095
That way he can go back to his kids and
family, and you can go to your sister's.

567
01:02:23,096 --> 01:02:26,731
And I could stay here!
In this parking lot!

568
01:02:26,732 --> 01:02:29,168
All by myself!

569
01:02:29,169 --> 01:02:32,807
Because that's obviously
what everybody wants!

570
01:02:36,709 --> 01:02:38,516
Angela?

571
01:02:44,249 --> 01:02:48,423
I just can't keep chasing
you around all night.

572
01:02:49,289 --> 01:02:53,893
Besides, the whole place is locked.

573
01:02:57,297 --> 01:02:59,239
Angela?

574
01:02:59,299 --> 01:03:03,176
Where are you gonna
go if you get away?

575
01:03:04,404 --> 01:03:06,813
It's freezing out there.

576
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:09,441
You can't go out.

577
01:03:10,909 --> 01:03:12,853
Angela?

578
01:03:14,414 --> 01:03:16,048
Angela!

579
01:03:21,121 --> 01:03:22,926
Angela?

580
01:03:32,865 --> 01:03:36,310
Way to ruin Christmas, Karl.

581
01:04:06,665 --> 01:04:10,543
<i>I'll have a blue</i>

582
01:04:11,404 --> 01:04:16,008
<i>Christmas without you</i>

583
01:04:17,377 --> 01:04:21,746
<i>I'll be so blue</i>

584
01:04:21,747 --> 01:04:27,023
<i>Just thinking about you</i>

585
01:04:28,754 --> 01:04:33,958
<i>Decorations of red</i>

586
01:04:33,959 --> 01:04:38,565
<i>On a green Christmas tree</i>

587
01:04:40,465 --> 01:04:44,276
<i>Won't be the same, dear</i>

588
01:04:44,338 --> 01:04:48,680
<i>If you're not here with me</i>

589
01:04:48,807 --> 01:04:52,753
<i>And when those blue</i>

590
01:04:52,911 --> 01:04:57,688
<i>Snowflakes start falling</i>

591
01:04:58,650 --> 01:05:02,596
<i>That's when those blue</i>

592
01:05:02,921 --> 01:05:07,527
<i>Memories start calling</i>

593
01:05:09,661 --> 01:05:14,472
<i>You'll be doing all right</i>

594
01:05:14,867 --> 01:05:19,575
<i>With your Christmas of white</i>

595
01:05:20,241 --> 01:05:24,609
<i>But I'll have a blue</i>

596
01:05:24,610 --> 01:05:28,216
<i>Blue, blue, blue Christmas</i>

597
01:05:49,635 --> 01:05:54,548
<i>You'll be doing all right</i>

598
01:05:54,940 --> 01:05:59,354
<i>With your Christmas of white</i>

599
01:06:00,281 --> 01:06:04,449
<i>But I'll have a blue</i>

600
01:06:04,450 --> 01:06:07,826
<i>Blue, blue, blue Christmas</i>

601
01:06:10,324 --> 01:06:13,164
Thank you. Thank you very much.

602
01:06:18,931 --> 01:06:21,067
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

603
01:07:08,114 --> 01:07:10,751
<i>Do you want makeup?</i>

604
01:07:11,783 --> 01:07:13,885
<i>Okay.</i>

605
01:07:17,358 --> 01:07:20,130
<i>You have the most beautiful lips</i>

606
01:07:20,159 --> 01:07:24,206
<i>I have ever seen in my life.</i>

607
01:07:25,264 --> 01:07:27,503
<i>You're beautiful.</i>

608
01:07:29,135 --> 01:07:32,444
<i>Thank you for accepting
my invitation.</i>

609
01:07:36,541 --> 01:07:39,281
<i>You have a wonderful body.</i>

610
01:07:43,216 --> 01:07:47,093
<i>It was meant to be, babe.</i>

611
01:07:48,954 --> 01:07:50,931
<i>Me and you.</i>

612
01:07:52,024 --> 01:07:54,865
<i>Your skin...</i>

613
01:07:57,063 --> 01:07:59,574
<i>It's soft.</i>

614
01:08:01,368 --> 01:08:03,173
<i>Honey.</i>

615
01:08:04,103 --> 01:08:08,980
<i>I love you. Angela,
you know that, right?</i>

616
01:08:28,294 --> 01:08:29,927
Hello?

617
01:08:29,928 --> 01:08:30,995
Shit.

618
01:08:30,996 --> 01:08:34,305
I'm down here. Hello?
Can you hear me?

619
01:08:39,638 --> 01:08:41,412
It's okay.

620
01:09:07,866 --> 01:09:10,071
Hello, Officer. Can I help you?

621
01:09:10,969 --> 01:09:13,414
<i>Can you open up the gate, please?</i>

622
01:09:15,241 --> 01:09:17,515
Yes, sir. I'll be right up.

623
01:09:22,248 --> 01:09:25,795
I'm sorry. I have to do this.

624
01:09:52,445 --> 01:09:54,183
Hey.

625
01:09:55,181 --> 01:09:59,024
Sorry about that. I was on the
bottom floor doing my rounds.

626
01:10:04,390 --> 01:10:05,657
What's going on tonight?

627
01:10:05,658 --> 01:10:09,995
We got a call about a disturbance at
this address. Know anything about that?

628
01:10:09,996 --> 01:10:12,664
No, it's been real quiet all night.

629
01:10:12,665 --> 01:10:15,404
See anything,
hear anything suspicious?

630
01:10:16,468 --> 01:10:19,845
Like I said,
I was just doing my rounds.

631
01:10:20,173 --> 01:10:22,607
It's been really quiet. I haven't
seen anybody down here.

632
01:10:22,608 --> 01:10:24,586
Any cars in there?

633
01:10:24,709 --> 01:10:27,415
Well, it is a parking garage.

634
01:10:29,348 --> 01:10:32,850
There's a few cars scattered
over here in this level.

635
01:10:32,851 --> 01:10:36,154
On the second level
there's a rental thing.

636
01:10:36,155 --> 01:10:39,857
Like I said, there's been no one around
tonight. Except me and Rocky.

637
01:10:39,858 --> 01:10:41,859
Two of you working here tonight.

638
01:10:41,860 --> 01:10:46,364
Kind of. He's my dog. He's
down in the office right now.

639
01:10:46,365 --> 01:10:49,800
We're gonna take a look around.
Get in the back. We'll give you a ride.

640
01:10:49,801 --> 01:10:51,710
That's a great idea.

641
01:10:52,371 --> 01:10:57,818
I've just gotta close this gate.
A lot of homeless people around here.

642
01:11:40,219 --> 01:11:42,220
Thanks for the ride.

643
01:11:42,221 --> 01:11:45,624
If you guys wanna check
out the other floors,

644
01:11:45,625 --> 01:11:47,359
just keep going around this way.

645
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:50,228
But be careful on P3. There's
a broken water main, okay?

646
01:11:50,229 --> 01:11:53,105
- We'll come back around.
- Okay.

647
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:03,805
What the hell's going on here, man?

648
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:51,960
Help me! Help!

649
01:14:18,576 --> 01:14:21,179
Help me! Help!

650
01:14:34,592 --> 01:14:36,536
Help me!

651
01:14:37,764 --> 01:14:40,464
Sure you haven't seen
anything weird tonight?

652
01:14:40,465 --> 01:14:44,275
No. Everybody left
really early tonight.

653
01:14:44,336 --> 01:14:46,237
You having a party in here?

654
01:14:46,238 --> 01:14:49,444
No, no. It's just me and
Rocky, not a party.

655
01:14:53,611 --> 01:14:57,015
Got anybody coming over to visit?
You know, a little action?

656
01:14:57,016 --> 01:15:01,019
Me? No. The company would fire me
if I had anyone down here tonight.

657
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:03,421
Especially at this hour.

658
01:15:03,422 --> 01:15:07,292
Well, we don't want to break
any rules. Right, partner?

659
01:15:07,293 --> 01:15:09,566
Not on my watch.

660
01:15:10,095 --> 01:15:12,197
Come on, let's go.

661
01:15:14,968 --> 01:15:17,012
Help me!

662
01:15:18,337 --> 01:15:19,905
Help me!

663
01:15:19,906 --> 01:15:23,843
I've got to open the gate,
so I'll just take the stairs.

664
01:15:23,844 --> 01:15:25,649
Let's do it.

665
01:15:45,164 --> 01:15:47,038
Open.

666
01:16:03,282 --> 01:16:05,954
Wait!

667
01:16:15,460 --> 01:16:16,862
You guys stay warm.

668
01:16:16,863 --> 01:16:20,774
- You keep your eyes and ears open, huh?
- You bet.

669
01:16:25,104 --> 01:16:28,116
- Merry Christmas.
- You too, buddy.

670
01:16:35,180 --> 01:16:38,522
Wait! Wait!

671
01:19:44,837 --> 01:19:46,138
<i>911.</i>

672
01:19:46,139 --> 01:19:48,606
- Yes, please, I need your help.
<i>- All our lines are busy at the moment.</i>

673
01:19:48,607 --> 01:19:49,674
<i>Please hold.</i>

674
01:19:49,675 --> 01:19:51,876
<i>- Someone will be with you shortly.</i>
- Hello?

675
01:19:51,877 --> 01:19:53,821
<i>Thank you.</i>

676
01:20:25,410 --> 01:20:28,582
<i>All our lines are busy at
the moment. Please hold.</i>

677
01:20:32,050 --> 01:20:35,689
<i>911. All our lines are
busy at the moment.</i>

678
01:20:43,896 --> 01:20:46,204
Rock? Rocky!

679
01:20:58,010 --> 01:21:02,057
Why would you do that?

680
01:21:05,517 --> 01:21:07,858
He's just an animal.

681
01:21:09,289 --> 01:21:11,232
Angela!

682
01:21:11,557 --> 01:21:14,899
Why would you kill a
defenseless animal?

683
01:21:26,004 --> 01:21:30,485
After all I did for you?
To help you?

684
01:21:31,677 --> 01:21:33,984
This is what I get?

685
01:21:34,947 --> 01:21:37,459
You killed my dog!

686
01:21:38,218 --> 01:21:40,484
Answer. Please answer.

687
01:21:40,485 --> 01:21:42,292
Angela?

688
01:21:42,621 --> 01:21:46,358
You're really starting
to piss me off!

689
01:21:46,359 --> 01:21:48,130
Angela!

690
01:22:37,009 --> 01:22:39,610
<i>Hello? Are you there?</i>

691
01:22:39,611 --> 01:22:43,284
<i>Hello? This is the police.
Is somebody there?</i>

692
01:22:44,082 --> 01:22:48,686
<i>Is this an emergency? If you can
hear me, please say something.</i>

693
01:22:48,687 --> 01:22:52,599
<i>Tap the phone, let me know
if you're there. Hello?</i>

694
01:22:53,091 --> 01:22:59,073
<i>This is the police. This is 911.
Are you okay? Are you there? Hello?</i>

695
01:23:03,835 --> 01:23:06,814
You're trying to get
me fired, aren't you?

696
01:23:09,174 --> 01:23:11,812
Bet you'd really like that.

697
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:28,096
But, honey...

698
01:23:29,795 --> 01:23:32,273
What are we gonna do then?

699
01:23:32,798 --> 01:23:36,038
We couldn't just live
off of your salary.

700
01:25:13,232 --> 01:25:14,499
Angela!

701
01:25:17,769 --> 01:25:19,610
Angela!

702
01:25:23,909 --> 01:25:25,716
Angela!

703
01:25:53,105 --> 01:25:55,414
Shit!

704
01:26:47,759 --> 01:26:49,464
Shit!

705
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:03,473
Let's fucking do this.
You want to fuck with me?

706
01:28:06,105 --> 01:28:07,978
Come on!

707
01:28:17,482 --> 01:28:19,993
Come on, you chicken shit!

708
01:29:34,093 --> 01:29:35,898
Angela?

709
01:29:38,097 --> 01:29:40,267
Let me help you out, okay?

710
01:29:54,579 --> 01:29:56,381
Help me? You're gonna help me?

711
01:29:56,382 --> 01:30:00,726
Why don't you let me help you,
for a change? Motherfucker!

712
01:30:31,717 --> 01:30:34,821
What the fuck are
you doing, Angela?

713
01:30:35,054 --> 01:30:38,692
Come back here, now! Let me go!

714
01:30:39,392 --> 01:30:43,098
Come over here and get
me out of this right now!

715
01:30:44,196 --> 01:30:47,140
Why are you doing this, Angela?

716
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:50,307
Angela.

717
01:30:51,737 --> 01:30:56,376
Angela? I just wanted
us to be friends.

718
01:30:57,942 --> 01:31:00,211
I'm alone.

719
01:31:00,212 --> 01:31:03,383
I'm always alone.

720
01:31:06,051 --> 01:31:09,359
Why can't we just spend
more time together?

721
01:31:10,756 --> 01:31:14,462
Angela? Wait.

722
01:31:14,994 --> 01:31:16,936
Why?

723
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:20,131
Why can't we be friends?

724
01:31:20,132 --> 01:31:24,646
Why can't we just spend
Christmas together?

725
01:31:24,804 --> 01:31:28,613
Do you hear me?
You stupid, fucking cunt!

726
01:31:41,020 --> 01:31:43,622
Angela, wait. I didn't...

727
01:31:43,755 --> 01:31:46,097
Merry Christmas, Thomas.

728
01:31:48,660 --> 01:31:53,131
No! No! No!

729
01:31:53,132 --> 01:31:55,266
No! No!

730
01:33:53,319 --> 01:33:55,626
You all right, lady?

731
01:34:02,062 --> 01:34:06,440
<i>I'll have a blue</i>

732
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:11,405
<i>Christmas without you</i>

733
01:34:12,773 --> 01:34:17,143
<i>I'll be so blue</i>

734
01:34:17,144 --> 01:34:22,420
<i>Just thinking about you</i>

735
01:34:24,151 --> 01:34:29,355
<i>Decorations of red</i>

736
01:34:29,356 --> 01:34:33,962
<i>On a green Christmas tree</i>

737
01:34:35,862 --> 01:34:39,672
<i>Won't be the same, dear</i>

738
01:34:39,734 --> 01:34:43,676
<i>If you're not here with me</i>

739
01:34:43,703 --> 01:34:48,050
<i>And when those blue</i>

740
01:34:48,308 --> 01:34:53,085
<i>Snowflakes start falling</i>

741
01:34:54,047 --> 01:34:57,993
<i>That's when those blue</i>

742
01:34:58,318 --> 01:35:02,924
<i>Memories start calling</i>

743
01:35:05,058 --> 01:35:09,869
<i>You'll be doing all right</i>

744
01:35:10,264 --> 01:35:14,972
<i>With your Christmas of white</i>

745
01:35:15,637 --> 01:35:20,006
<i>But I'll have a blue</i>

746
01:35:20,007 --> 01:35:23,612
<i>Blue, blue, blue Christmas</i>

747
01:35:45,032 --> 01:35:49,945
<i>You'll be doing all right</i>

748
01:35:50,337 --> 01:35:54,751
<i>With your Christmas of white</i>

749
01:35:55,677 --> 01:35:59,846
<i>But I'll have a blue</i>

750
01:35:59,847 --> 01:36:03,223
<i>Blue, blue, blue Christmas</i>
