1
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:35,994
Stay back, stay back.

2
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:37,704
Stay away!

3
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:39,414
No way we're going to heaven now.

4
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,167
We're alive, so this is heaven.

7
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,124
I heard that in some countries,

8
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,668
they mourn adults
more than they do with children.

9
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,714
And in others,
children more than adults.

10
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,967
Which do you think our country is?

11
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:37,806
What do you mean?

12
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,685
When kids die, you lose hope but…

13
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:45,772
when adults die, you lose their wisdom.

14
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:47,941
Hope and wisdom.

15
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,317
Which do we value more?

16
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:53,780
Hmm?

17
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,870
They've been flying
all over the place since yesterday.

18
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:04,124
They would have already saved us
if they really wanted to.

19
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:10,296
But even if they do come to save us,
we won't get out first.

20
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:14,592
We're just not important enough for that.

21
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:21,391
We're students. That's it.

22
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,817
<i>We're coming in.</i>

23
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,319
<i>Set to control, steady.</i>
<i>Prepare for landing.</i>

24
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,780
<i>Okay, roger.</i>

25
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,660
<i>Landing pad is clear.</i>
<i>We're touching down.</i>

<i>We have everyone on board.</i>
<i>Heading to the quarantine camp now.</i>

28
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:12,525
<i>Around 11:00 a.m.</i>
<i>this morning,</i>

29
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:15,069
<i>the government announced</i>
<i>the declaration of martial law</i>

30
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,322
<i>in an effort to control</i>
<i>the crisis in Hyosan.</i>

31
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:21,534
<i>Starting sometime yesterday afternoon,</i>
<i>a strange epidemic began to spread,</i>

32
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:22,619
which lead to an evacuation order

33
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,370
-and a city-wide lockdown.
-<i>And a city-wide lockdown.</i>

34
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:28,666
It's the first time in 41 years
that martial law has been declared.

35
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,919
<i>Last time was</i>
<i>the Democratization Movement</i>

36
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,837
<i>on May 18th, 1980.</i>

37
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:36,591
<i>I repeat. Martial law has been declared</i>
<i>in order to control the Hyosan--</i>

38
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:39,302
<i>The sense of panic</i>
<i>caused by the Hyosan epidemic</i>

39
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,596
<i>has sent markets into a death spiral.</i>

40
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:44,724
<i>Sidecar investments were activated</i>
<i>for both KOSPI and KOSDAQ</i>

41
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:46,726
<i>which came as volatile</i>
<i>market respondent to Covid-19…</i>

42
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:49,646
No refugees from Hyosan!
We don't want them!

43
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,690
We don't want them!
We don't want them!

44
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:56,778
No refugees. Go back!
Go back where you came from.

45
00:03:56,861 --> 00:04:00,448
<i>We are the Lord's people</i>
<i>who receives salvation.</i>

46
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,367
People will die as people,

47
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,328
and demons are going to perish
as all demons must.

48
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,663
Amen.

49
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,498
Get away!

50
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,916
Look out!

51
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,671
You're killing us.

52
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,589
Go home!

53
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,133
Come on, Zuki. It's okay, okay. Thank you.

54
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:21,678
-Why won't you let us in?
-Get the hell of me.

55
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:26,349
Send them back. Go home!

56
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:29,102
Please. You have to help us!

57
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,439
REMOVE THE GOVERNMENT!

58
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,526
<i>Our Lord Jesus Christ</i>

<i>A person</i>

REMOVE THE GOVERNMENT!

SUBWAY ZOMBIE PERFORMANCE
APOLOGY VIDEO

79
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,635
We have to expand
martial law to control the media.

80
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:49,432
There are rumors that radiation
from US nuclear bombs created the zombies.

81
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:53,561
That the heads of Korea's
top 30 corporations fled the country.

82
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,480
Most of the media are spreading fake news

83
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:58,274
and sharing it online
without verifying sources.

84
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,068
It's contributing to all the chaos.

85
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,278
The government
should not control the media.

86
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,114
The people themselves
should control the media.

87
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,950
And our citizens
have enough power to do that.

88
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,952
No expansion in martial law.

89
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,246
Let's focus on containment

90
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,290
and rescuing the uninfected.

91
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,417
Those are our priorities.

92
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,087
-Su-hyeok.
-Hey, Bare-su.

93
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,047
Are you okay?

94
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,048
Where's the phone?

95
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:23,174
And Cheong-san?

96
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,394
Su-hyeok.

97
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,439
Where is he?

98
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,113
We got separated in the teacher's office.

99
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,990
I'm sure he'll be fine.

100
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:51,244
Are you serious? Oh, shit!

101
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:54,080
I'm sorry…

102
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:56,833
for coming back alone.

103
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:11,639
Come here.

104
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:13,558
Come here.

105
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:28,656
Were you bit? You were bit, right?

106
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:29,991
No, I--

107
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:31,761
Cut it out.

108
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,638
Give me the fucking phone.

109
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,306
You killed the principal.
You're a murderer.

110
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,016
You made me kill him. You shit.

111
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,645
-You wanted proof I wasn't a coward.
-You're insane.

112
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:09,173
Get off me.

113
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:21,394
Should I save you?

114
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,729
What do you say?

115
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,733
Beg for your life. Come on.

116
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,193
Screw you.

117
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,363
Damn it.

00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,781

I'll kill you.

124
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:43,225
I will kill you.

125
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,187
Fuck you.

126
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,188
I'll…

127
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,357
I'll kill you.

Oh, shit.

00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:57,711
Oh, shit.

137
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,714
Oh, seriously--

138
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:27,783
Shit.

00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,581
I told you we should just
stay put, didn't I?

How are we gonna find your brother
in the middle of all this?

141
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,377

00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:01,752
all unconfirmed rumors, simultaneously,

164
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,588
in the interest of operational efficiency,

165
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,216
<i>all cell phone services…</i>

166
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,009
<i>…landlines, internet services,</i>

167
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,220
-<i>and all communication originating…</i>
-Why it isn't working?

168
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,847
-<i>…in Hyosan will be terminated…</i>
-Huh?

169
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,140
What's wrong?

170
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,434
…from this point on.

171
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,486
That's so weird.
The internet cable's plugged in.

172
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,113
-I'm trying to refresh it.
-Hey, get the phone over there.

173
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:30,155
Okay.

174
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,664
Shit. Fucking assholes.

175
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,792
They cut off the phones and internet.

176
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,460
We at Martial Law Command,

177
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,921
and its advisory council,
are doing our best

178
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,548
to suppress the continuous spread.

179
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:52,344
<i>Moreover,</i>
<i>we are focusing all of our resources</i>

180
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,431
<i>to rescue the people</i>
<i>who are currently trapped.</i>

181
00:16:56,473 --> 00:17:00,019
<i>If you live in Hyosan,</i>
<i>and you're watching this now,</i>

182
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:04,940

<i>in your location to be rescued.</i>

183
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,316
NO SIGNAL

OCTOBER 21, THURSDAY

185
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,250
WATER FLOW DETECTOR

186
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:14,885
What do we do?
On-jo and Cheong-san are really close.

187
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,179
They're going out.

188
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,139
But On-jo told me they're not.

189
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:21,517
I'm telling you they are.

190
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,769
They're always together.

191
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,189
Really?

192
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:29,399
NAM ON-JO

193
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,776
Poor On-jo.

194
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:48,127
I'm sure Cheong-san is fine.

195
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,380
You know how fast he is.

196
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,134
I don't know why he never listens.

197
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,720
Ever since we were kids,
he's just never listened to me.

198
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,726
I told him not to go,
but, of course, he did.

199
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:07,020
I'm sorry.

200
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,649
I should've brought him back here.

201
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:17,990
Where do you think…

202
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,244
he is now?

203
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,957
I'm pretty sure
he's in a safe hiding spot.

204
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:42,681
Joon-yeong. Didn't you mention
that your science club made a drone?

205
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:46,185
Yeah. You want to look
for Cheong-san with it?

206
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:49,646
-Could we?
-Well, yeah. But it's in the science lab.

207
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,939
We can go get it.

208
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:54,443
How would we get it?
It's crawling with zombies out there.

209
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,446
That.

210
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,951
You want me
to climb up on that?

211
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,245
But there are zombies
in the science lab too.

212
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:08,790
There weren't any
in the supply room. Right?

213
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,083
That's true, but…

214
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,172
We have to find Cheong-san.

215
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,800
There's no one else besides us
to start looking

216
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,344
and rescue people.

217
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,601
Yeah.

218
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:29,519
It would be good if we had the drone.

219
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:32,731
We can find Cheong-san and then
we can see how things are outside.

220
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,777
We might even be able to send
an emergency message and ask for help.

221
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,821
Sure, that would be really great.

222
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,617
But who's gonna go?

223
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,826
I wanna go.

224
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,372
I took a fire rescue class,
and I've climbed ropes before.

225
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:50,749
No, I'll go.

226
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,378
You already went out there.

227
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:57,130
You can't keep
putting yourself in danger.

228
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,424
The drone isn't finished yet,

229
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,260
we need to find
a few more parts to run it.

230
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,595
Do you know what to get?

231
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,102
Then I have to go anyway, I guess.

232
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,021
I'll go with On-jo.

233
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,147
No way.

234
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,028
I'm actually going this time
so stand back.

235
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,154
But you can't.

236
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,407
He can't.

237
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,117
The rope won't hold you.

238
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,329
It was fine when I came down.
But it'll snap if I climb up, right?

239
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:31,873
-Yeah. Right.
-Yeah. It'll snap.

240
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,333
Right. Good boy.

241
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,794
Joon-yeong, come with me.

242
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,171
Mm.

243
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,009
It's too dangerous.

244
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:43,927
I'll go.

245
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:54,521
Thank you.

246
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,398
But I don't want you…

247
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,985
to be put in danger anymore.

248
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:03,572
I'm going.

249
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:12,622
I'm going.

250
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,518
Be careful, On-jo.

251
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,357
Be safe. We'll be watching, okay?

252
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:00,754
Do you think…

253
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:03,256
it's really safe out there?

254
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:05,425
I'm sure it is.

255
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,930
Like you said,
there are soldiers and cops, right?

256
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:17,354
I wanna go to my dad's factory
and my mom's <i>sundae </i>place.

257
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,315
Whatever.

258
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,609
You hate the smell
of leather and <i>sundae</i> anyway.

259
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,404
Yeah, I do.

260
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,823
I just want my mom's <i>sundae </i>soup.

261
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:35,038
So you finally grew up?
You should have said that earlier.

262
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,459
Now, it's too late.

263
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,135
Hey. Hey, look.

264
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:50,846
I bet there's a key in there, right?

265
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,558
I don't think so.

266
00:23:57,018 --> 00:24:00,063
Shouldn't we just hide somewhere safe
and wait to be rescued?

267
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,231
Hey.

268
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:03,358
He said the solution
is on his laptop at the school.

269
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,694
We have to hurry and notify
Fire and Disasters HQ.

270
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:09,698
The people who have important information
need to survive, am I right?

271
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,741
So doesn't our survival come first?

272
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:13,660
Why do you keep acting
better than everyone

273
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:16,329
like some elite leader of society?
You're from Seoul University?

274
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:20,500
-Yeah.
-Huh? Wait?

275
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,252
You really went there? Serious?

276
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:25,130
Well, I haven't graduated yet.
I'm going back.

277
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:26,423
Oh, grad school?

278
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:28,592
-No. I'm a sophomore.
-What?

279
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:32,095
Your exams? You retake?

280
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,513
Uh, few times. Yeah.

281
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:35,724
I went after high school.

282
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:40,645
Oh, wow. I guess you must really
had your nose to the crime stuff, huh?

283
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:42,522
Your face says it all.

284
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:47,277
Hey. Apparently, you're smart,
so I'm gonna say this once.

285
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:49,279
Be quiet and follow me.

286
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,323
Wait.

287
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:53,783
Shit!

288
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,412
Whoa!

289
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:03,084
Shut the door. Shut the door!

290
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,798
Why won't it start?

291
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,344
Hurry up!

292
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:13,595
Please spare me!

293
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:16,181
Come on. This way.

294
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:17,265
Wait.

295
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:20,310
Let's go! Here.

296
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:21,394
Hurry!

297
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:25,190
GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR NEW BUSINESS

298
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,318
Oh, my God.

299
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:30,111
It's a zombie, sir.

300
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,864
There's a zombie in here.

301
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,831
-In there?
-Yeah.

302
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:44,125
Shit!

303
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:55,178
CHEONGSAN CHICKEN

304
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:57,472
It's all right. Come on.

305
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:00,725
Sure?

306
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,186
She's tied up. it's okay.

307
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:08,525
A student should be in school.
Why is she in a chicken place?

308
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:09,985
And why she tied…

309
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,069
Oh, my gosh!

310
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,905
What? What? What?

311
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,156
Right there. There.

312
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,244
What? What is that?

313
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,958
Oh, shit.

314
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,214
Is… is it okay?

315
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:33,425
Is, is the baby a zombie?

316
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,513
No. It's alive.

317
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:02,162
Why don't you go check the fridge
for some milk or something?

318
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:03,788
Why? Are you thirsty?

319
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:06,708
It's for the baby.

320
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:11,004
We need to feed this baby somehow.
It's very dehydrated.

321
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:14,966
What if there's no milk?

322
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,593
Can you just check first?

323
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:18,720
Check the fridge,
and if there's no milk, come back,

324
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:21,139
and we cross that bridge
when we come to it, okay?

325
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:22,932
Uh, yeah. You're right. Yeah.

326
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,312
-If there's no milk, maybe I should bring?
-Just check first. Can you do that?

327
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:30,148
Check. Damn it.

328
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:37,989
What do we do now?

329
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:44,412
What else can we do? Back to HQ.

330
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:47,332
What about that?

331
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,502
It's hard enough with just us.

332
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:52,045
Are you gonna bring it along?

333
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:09,938
Oh, careful.

334
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:12,440
The drone and the bag are right there.

335
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:19,739
Okay. Where was it?

336
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:22,492
Where is the battery?

337
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:42,053
I can't stop thinking
about this one thing.

338
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:43,972
What?

339
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:52,355
If eventually everyone in the world
but us ends up turning in too?

340
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:55,191
No way.

341
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:57,694
But if that were true?

342
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,321
Nah.

343
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:03,408
Then we'd be the minority.

344
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:07,620
And all minorities
have a way of going extinct.

345
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:12,834
We're not the minority.

346
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:16,171
But what if that actually happens?

347
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,507
You think you could make it through this?

348
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,096
I don't know.

349
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:29,058
But I don't wanna be a zombie.

350
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,478
You don't recognize anyone.

351
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,104
And…

352
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:37,358
I won't even recognize you.

353
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,204
In case I do get bitten,
I have a favor to ask.

354
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:51,873
No.

355
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:53,833
Don't get bit.

356
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,462
-If by chance--
-No.

357
00:29:58,379 --> 00:29:59,756
Don't get bit. You can't.

358
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:02,926
Don't even think about dying.

359
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,347
THIS DOOR DOES NOT OPEN FROM THE INSIDE

360
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,932
Shit.

361
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:10,827
-Eat up, I-sak.
-Thanks.

362
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,872
On-jo. Which do you like better?

363
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:17,333
-Mm, they're both good.
-Is that right?

364
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,261
Is it better like this?

365
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:30,471
Or like this?

366
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:40,899
Why?

367
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:08,635
Fuck this.

368
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,405
MUSIC ROOM

369
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:36,955
INSTRUMENT STORAGE

370
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,170
Hey, be careful.

371
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,005
Take your time. Take your time.

372
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:49,092
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

373
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:03,356
HELP, WE'RE IN THE BROADCASTING ROOM
IN HYOSAN HIGH SCHOOL

374
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:13,074
Does it work?

375
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:14,492
Is it working?

376
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:15,660
I think it will.

377
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:24,544
Ooh.

378
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:32,802
Holy crap.

379
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:34,637
That thing's crazy fast.

380
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:37,390
I'll take it outside
after I find Cheong-san.

381
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:39,934
If I find any rescuers out there,
I'll land in front of them.

382
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,185
Okay. Okay, okay.

383
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,940
Wait a second.

384
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,443
They say when people know
their situation is hopeless,

385
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,487
that's when they despair.

386
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:56,701
Sweet saying.

387
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:58,619
But what does that mean?

388
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,753
Even if everyone in the world
but us turned into zombies,

389
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,922
we can't fall in to despair.

390
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:12,717
Ahh. So that's what that means?

391
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:15,511
Nam-ra.

392
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,639
It's best to make a plan
and try to stick to it,

393
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:22,226
but we're not all top students,
and we can't be as smart as you.

394
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:26,064
Being logical isn't part of human nature.

395
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,982
In a crisis, it's better to be logical.

396
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,650
We need hope more than logic.

397
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,071
Don't you think that's best right now?

398
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,992
Hey. I think…

399
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:40,995
flying the drone
is what we need right now.

400
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:45,500
-Okay. Try it.
-Here goes.

401
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,376
Mm.

402
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,818
Oh, no.

403
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:13,861
Everyone's zombie.

404
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:23,830
I shouldn't even bother studying.

405
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:24,747
Shit.

406
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:26,332
I can't take my CSAT anyway.

407
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,585
Shit. I'll never studying again
as long as I live.

408
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:32,463
Can you please be serious
for once in your life?

409
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,340
I'm dead serious right now.

410
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:38,344
What are you gonna do?
Keep looking for your brother?

411
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:42,849
The archery center has an emergency phone.

412
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:45,059
It automatically connects
to emergency services.

413
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,310
-Really?
-Yeah.

414
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,771
We got a hotline installed a while ago
because of some injuries.

415
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:51,899
And if it doesn't connect?
All the phones and internet are dead.

416
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,067
It doesn't matter.

417
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,445
That's where all the arrows are anyway.

418
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,698
I have less than 20 left.

419
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:01,075
We'll need more
if we wanna leave the school alive.

420
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,161
-I think, uh--
-Okay, let's go.

421
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:06,038
Go to the archery center
so we can get your arrows.

422
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:09,292
Then we should probably go home
or maybe go to a supermarket.

423
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,544
You know. In most zombie movies,

424
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:14,714
the ones that go to supermarkets
always manage to survive in the end.

425
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,175
And they have cigs.

426
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:18,384
I think that we--

427
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:20,511
The dumpsters
are right under these windows.

428
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:23,681
I think it's better to jump
than use the stairs.

429
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:27,268
Yeah. Let's jump.

430
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:30,146
Falling from the third floor is way better
than falling your exams, right?

431
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,982
Hey, let me get a word in!

432
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:33,983
Hey, Min-jae.

433
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:36,277
Go down first and shoot any
that come running.

434
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,695
Okay.

435
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:39,989
Then you two go down
and help him out as much as you can.

436
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:41,824
I'll cover you out in the hallway
and bring up the rear.

437
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:42,825
Mm.

438
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:45,203
What do you wanna say?

439
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,163
Uh, I think we should just stay here.

440
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:50,082
The adults will rescue us.

441
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,376
If you wanna stay, be my guest.

442
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,087
But I don't trust adults.

443
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:03,137
Ahh, shit. She's just so my type.

444
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,389
I'm too scared to stay here alone.

445
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:07,266
Hurry up.

446
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:39,799
Look out! Behind you!

447
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:41,008
Move.

448
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,018
Oh, shit. Why are we so high up?

449
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:55,523
-Jump already.
-All right, I'm going.

450
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,695
Shit.

451
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,089
No one in the infirmary.

452
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:22,508
Joon-yeong, go somewhere else.

453
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:28,180
Wait. Hold on. Stop right there.

454
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,308
Is that an arrow?

455
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:31,809
-Where?
-This.

456
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,145
You're right. It is.

457
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:35,646
Why? What?

458
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:38,691
My older sister.

459
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:42,153
She had a competition today.

460
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,090
Where the hell did Cheong-san go?

461
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:43,339
It's Cheong-san!

462
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:45,257
-What room is that?
-Cheong-san!

463
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:46,384
He… He can't hear you.

464
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,386
Be quiet.

465
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:50,721
-Hey, Cheong-san!
-He can't hear you.

466
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:51,764
On-jo, it's okay.

467
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:54,392
Cheong-san is alive!

468
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:56,018
Cheong-san is alive!

469
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:03,567
Ah…

470
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:09,490
What's he doing? Where's he going?

471
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:10,908
Look this way! Over here!

472
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:12,993
Where are you going, you stupid moron?

473
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,203
He can't hear you, Dae-su!

474
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:17,373
Be quiet, will you?
You're so damn loud.

475
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:18,624
My bad. My bad.

476
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,711
Didn't you say the battery was low?

477
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:25,714
Yeah. I couldn't charge it,
so it's almost dead.

478
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:27,967
Now that we know for sure
where Cheong-san is,

479
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,802
let's go look somewhere else.

480
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:31,762
You wanted to check outside
and ask for help?

481
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:34,723
On-jo, is that okay?

482
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:38,394
Mm-hmm. Now that we know he's alive.

483
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:39,979
Okay. Here it goes.

484
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:49,738
<i>Whoa.</i>

485
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:51,615
It's totally Zombieland out there.

486
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,536
I think we should look
outside of the school grounds.

487
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:58,247
Let's take it outside.

488
00:40:58,831 --> 00:40:59,707
Okay.

489
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:14,305
Wait a minute.

490
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,307
What is it?

491
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,684
Wait a sec.

492
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:19,643
Just… wait.

493
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,860
What?

494
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:33,282
Wha, what's wrong, Ji-min?

495
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:34,992
Wait a minute.

496
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:39,371
I-I can't…

497
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,375
What? What is it?

498
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:48,881
This…

499
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:53,802
That's my dad's car.

500
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,056
Which one?

501
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:59,642
The white one? The black one?

502
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:02,228
It's this truck.

503
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,647
It's my dad's car.

504
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:10,069
Don't worry.

505
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:12,821
I'm sure there are lots of cars like that.

506
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:16,450
Hang on. I'll check.

507
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,233
Ji-min.

508
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:22,600
11:47 AM
ABANDONED PRISON IN THE SUBURB OF HYOSAN

509
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:06,226
<i>Attention, citizens of Hyosan.</i>

510
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,645
<i>Please proceed calmly…</i>

511
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:10,981
-Where are we going? Where are we going?
-<i>…to the first quarantine.</i>

512
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:13,400
-Do you see us--
-Don't you!

513
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:14,318
-Hey!
-We're not animals!

514
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:16,195
-We've been waiting here for hours!
-<i>Please cooperate</i>

515
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:18,739
<i>with the tests to determine</i>
<i>whether or not you are infected…</i>

516
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:23,827
<i>…will be returned to you</i>
<i>at the later stage.</i>

517
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:26,163
<i>I repeat.</i>

518
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:31,919
<i>Please proceed calmly</i>
<i>to the first quarantine checkpoint…</i>

519
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:35,089
<i>and surrender your personal belongings.</i>

520
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:40,219
<i>This is for your safety,</i>
<i>and the safety of those around you.</i>

521
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:44,139
<i>We appreciate your continuous cooperation.</i>

522
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:46,475
EXAMINATION ROOM

523
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:50,604
Thank you for your service.
Where's the control room?

524
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:56,235
As per Martial Law,

525
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:59,029
you have to quarantine
until you are examined.

526
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:01,490
Why in the world
would she have to quarantine now?

527
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:02,866
She just came back from a battlefield--

528
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:04,868
-It's okay. That's enough.
-Unbelievable.

529
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:07,579
So, where is the control room?

530
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:09,707
You have to be examined first.

531
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,959
I'm not refusing to be examined.

532
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,961
Please follow the protocols.

533
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:17,381
Hyosan Fire Station.
Rescue Team One, Captain Nam So-ju.

534
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:19,675
I was responsible for them
from mobilization until rescue.

535
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:20,759
Enough!

536
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,095
Does it sound like
I'm asking your opinion?

537
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:26,807
-Take them to the exam room.
-Yes, sir.

538
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:42,531
What is this place?

539
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:45,534
This isn't an examination room.

540
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:48,162
There are lots
of people in line for exams,

541
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:49,163
you have to wait your turn.

542
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:52,332
Then you should've explained the situation
and asked her to wait somewhere else

543
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:53,625
and then escorted her.

544
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:55,419
What the hell is wrong with you?

545
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:57,379
There are plenty
of other people outside

546
00:45:57,463 --> 00:46:00,132
who are sitting on mats
on a concrete floor.

547
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:02,801
We're trying to make you
as comfortable as possible

548
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:04,178
because you're an assemblywoman.

549
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:09,141
The wait time
for an examination is 12 to 72 hours.

550
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:11,101
Wait a minute.

551
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:14,021
My daughter is at her school right now.

552
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:16,565
It may be too late if we keep waiting.

553
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:19,026
Please request a rescue.

554
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:21,862
We're doing the best we can.

555
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:24,239
Wait here for now.

556
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:22,965
Oh, shit.

557
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:25,634
Did I die?

558
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,847
Am I dead?

559
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:51,827
Hey.

560
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:03,088
Aren't, aren't you gonna eat me,
you zombie bastards?

561
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:08,594
I gave them serotonin injections
for a week,

562
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:10,637
but it had no effect whatsoever.

563
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:13,807
The moment an antivirus enters the body,

564
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:16,643
the virus mutates
and stops attacking its target.

565
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:20,480
<i>The only explanation</i>
<i>is that the cells learn and evolve.</i>

566
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:25,152
If this virus…

567
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:28,989
manages to learn human consciousness…

568
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:42,836
…a new species of humankind could be born.

569
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:53,764
Cheong-san, you son of a bitch!

570
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:56,350
I'll kill you.

571
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:46,942
What the fuck?

572
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:52,906
That means…

573
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:58,537
ONE HEART

574
00:49:58,620 --> 00:49:59,788
…I'm God.

575
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:09,715
Hey, Cheong-san!

576
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:12,040
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTIONAL.
