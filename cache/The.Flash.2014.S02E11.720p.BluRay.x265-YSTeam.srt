1
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:05,966
BARRY: My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,381 --> 00:00:10,009
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

3
00:00:10,384 --> 00:00:12,887
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

4
00:00:13,387 --> 00:00:16,062
I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.

5
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:18,643
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

6
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:22,030
but in doing so,
I opened up our world to new threats.

7
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,326
And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

8
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:27,532
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:29,446
JOE: Previously on The Flash...

10
00:00:29,862 --> 00:00:32,536
DR. WELLS: I stabbed your mother
in the heart. And I was free.

11
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:35,786
CISCO: Eddie's his ancestor.
If Eddie dies, he'll never be born.

12
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:37,625
He's being erased from existence!

13
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:39,752
- EOBARD: Gideon.
- Yes, Professor Thawne?

14
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:40,923
Where the hell am I?

15
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:44,094
I was accepted into the forensic science
program at Midway City University.

16
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:45,378
I'm leaving Central City.

17
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,843
BARRY: Joe, you have a son.

18
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:48,765
Hi, I'm Wally. I'm Francine's son.

19
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:51,768
These races, that's the only way that
I can pay for my mom's hospital bills.

20
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:53,679
Jesse's my daughter and Zoom has her.

21
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,223
Daddy! Please help me.
Don't let him take me back.

22
00:00:56,722 --> 00:00:59,100
DR. WELLS:
I would do anything to get you back.

23
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,072
BARRY: There are many reasons why we run.

24
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:07,656
But, usually, it's to avoid
what's right in front of us,

25
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:11,117
a decision to be made,
or a dilemma we have to face.

26
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:14,954
Lately, for me, it feels like
running is all I've been doing.

27
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:17,748
What you got for me, Cisco?

28
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:20,835
You've been playing Good Samaritan
all morning. Take a break.

29
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:24,171
Are you sure you don't wanna
get to CCPD, give Patty your attention?

30
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:25,460
No, I can see her later.

31
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:27,216
'Cause we cannot afford
to waste any more time.

32
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,472
What, 'cause we just been
sipping Mai Tais since you got here?

33
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,302
I don't know what you've been sipping
since I got here,

34
00:01:31,507 --> 00:01:33,180
but Barry needs to get
better, stronger, faster.

35
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,890
We need to train to prepare for Zoom.

36
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:38,897
Oh, I see.
You haven't had your coffee this morning.

37
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,650
I had my coffee this morning.
Don't slurp.

38
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,820
Don't. Don't. Don't.

39
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,152
(COMPUTER TRILLING)

40
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:50,444
Runaway chemical transport truck
heading south on Kester.

41
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:51,736
On it.

42
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:54,490
(SIRENS BLARING)

43
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:11,426
Hey, uh... I can't stop the truck!
Somebody rigged it.

44
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,099
Sorry!

45
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,020
You can't let that truck crash. If you do,
you'll take out a whole city block.

46
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:19,181
Great. Thank you. Thank you for that.

47
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:20,816
(HONKING)

48
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,353
(WHISPERING)
That was close. That was close.

49
00:02:25,853 --> 00:02:28,026
Oh, and the plot thickens.

50
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,533
CISCO: Dead end dump ahead.
You gotta get out of there.

51
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:31,818
Oh, come on.

52
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:34,820
Yes!

53
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:53,844
That one was a little close.

54
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,270
Nice.
Now can you please, please take a break?

55
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,056
- How's that for training?
- Great.

56
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:03,812
Look, we're gonna catch Zoom.

57
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,478
We got Turtle locked up in the pipeline.

58
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:08,405
All we got to do is use him to figure
out how to steal Zoom's speed

59
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,566
And then we'll get your daughter back.

60
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,866
That might take longer than we thought.

61
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,151
Why is that?

62
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,116
Because Turtle's dead.

63
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,247
Barry, we need you back here. Stat.

64
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,831
All right. I'm on my way.

65
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:28,675
Gideon.

66
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,882
Was the trip a success, Professor Thawne?

67
00:03:31,877 --> 00:03:32,878
I believe it was.

68
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:35,890
I've finally figured out
what time period The Flash is from.

69
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,555
Now let's figure out a way to get home.

70
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:47,770
CISCO: He better not be pulling a Juliet.

71
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,697
Yeah, that's right. I see plays.

72
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:52,323
He's dead, Cisco.

73
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:53,734
How'd this happen?

74
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,240
Preliminary brain scan shows
an acute brain aneurysm.

75
00:03:57,027 --> 00:03:59,701
The night we captured him.
How's that for timing?

76
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,617
What does that mean?
You think I did this, Garrick?

77
00:04:02,908 --> 00:04:06,378
This man is the key to us stopping Zoom.
The key to me saving my daughter.

78
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:07,747
Why would I want that?

79
00:04:07,955 --> 00:04:10,003
Never understood why you
do anything, Harrison.

80
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:11,884
That's fine with me, Garrick.

81
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,263
Guys, look.

82
00:04:15,254 --> 00:04:18,303
We need to figure out how to stop Zoom.
Everything we've tried so far has failed.

83
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,310
We need to start thinking outside the box.

84
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,641
I mean, we haven't even figured out
how to close the breaches yet.

85
00:04:22,928 --> 00:04:23,896
Maybe that's where we should start.

86
00:04:24,096 --> 00:04:26,690
That's a good idea.
I'll get on that.

87
00:04:27,057 --> 00:04:28,651
- L'll help.
- (PHONE BUZZES)

88
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,779
I've gotta get to the CCPD.
I'll check in with you guys later.

89
00:04:32,062 --> 00:04:33,110
Okay.

90
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,901
Every time
you think that Wells is on your team,

91
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,788
something happens that makes you doubt it.

92
00:04:41,822 --> 00:04:45,293
Hey. I just wanted to see
if you could run this trace for me.

93
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:47,579
Someone messed with
an ethanol transport truck this morning.

94
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,374
They cut the brake line
and tampered with the gear shafts.

95
00:04:51,415 --> 00:04:52,417
Okay. Yeah.

96
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:56,971
Okay. Wow. You're backed up, huh?

97
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,798
Iam, yeah.

98
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:03,228
Yeah. I guess I'll find out
what that's like once I finish CSI School.

99
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:05,855
- (CHUCKLES) Yeah. You will. I guess.
- Yeah.

100
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,276
Look, Barry, I know that you're upset,

101
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,069
but I was hoping it wouldn't
be like this between us.

102
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,731
(BARRY swans)

103
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:18,072
What did you think it was gonna be like?

104
00:05:19,026 --> 00:05:22,201
(CHUCKLES) I just thought we could
at least talk before I left.

105
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:23,490
You're moving.

106
00:05:23,697 --> 00:05:24,665
I don't know. I mean, it just

107
00:05:24,865 --> 00:05:28,620
doesn't feel like
there's much to talk about now, right?

108
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:31,540
I guess not.

109
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,459
PATTY: Hey.

110
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:38,634
- Hey.
- Hey.

111
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:44,764
I sort of overheard some of that.

112
00:05:45,052 --> 00:05:47,021
Mmm-hmm. Um...

113
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,024
Patty's going to CSI school,
in Midway City.

114
00:05:50,307 --> 00:05:51,810
She is moving in two days.

115
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,024
I mean, you don't have to let her leave.

116
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:57,235
She's wanted to be a CSI her whole life.
I'm not gonna stand in the way of that.

117
00:05:58,233 --> 00:05:59,233
Hey.

118
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:03,654
What's wrong?

119
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,865
Just went to see Francine and, uh...

120
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:08,035
She doesn't have much time.

121
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:11,920
I already said my goodbyes,
if you want to do the same.

122
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,300
CISCO: It's not gonna work.

123
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,521
They're closing the breaches,
that's like solving Einstein's riddle.

124
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,899
Yeah.
I solved Einstein's riddle when I was 10.

125
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,644
Yeah, well, maybe Earth-2 Einstein
wasn't as clever as ours.

126
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,858
You realize this earth
is my Earth-2, right?

127
00:06:38,105 --> 00:06:39,231
Listen to this.

128
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:43,946
What if we can figure out
how to control my powers?

129
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,113
We could find Zoom, get the jump on him.

130
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,408
That's a good idea.
You should get on that.

131
00:06:49,074 --> 00:06:50,201
I need your help, Harry.

132
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:53,959
What you need, Ramon, is to
figure out what triggers your vibes.

133
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,874
Exactly.
And I don't know what triggers them,

134
00:06:56,081 --> 00:06:57,048
It's completely inconsistent.

135
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,218
Sometimes it's when I touch
something that belongs to a breacher,

136
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:00,718
Sometimes it just happens.

137
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,516
There's always a cause. Cause, effect.
Doesn't take Einstein to figure that out.

138
00:07:04,798 --> 00:07:06,516
Okay, so what is the cause?

139
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,771
You saw when I tried to vibe Dr. Light,
when I tried to vibe you.

140
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,518
It took a while to work.

141
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:17,190
Yes. Yes, it did.

142
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,026
Meet me in the Time Vault.

143
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,528
For what?

144
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,115
Hello?

145
00:07:32,534 --> 00:07:33,536
Hello?

146
00:07:36,413 --> 00:07:37,415
Harry?

147
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:43,463
Of course.

148
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:47,468
Now he's gonna make me wait
in this freaky-ass Braille room.

149
00:07:49,843 --> 00:07:51,312
- DR. WELLS: Hi, Cisco.
- (SHRIEKING)

150
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,228
(STUTTERS) Stop! Don't do that!

151
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:55,812
(GROANS)

152
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,106
I figured out your trigger.

153
00:08:00,437 --> 00:08:01,654
The rush of adrenaline.

154
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,076
Dopamine floods the brain.

155
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:10,456
And the quickest way
to achieve that result...

156
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:13,994
Fear!

157
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:17,913
Do not move!

158
00:08:18,872 --> 00:08:19,964
You can't be.

159
00:08:32,177 --> 00:08:33,350
What did you see?

160
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,144
Reverse-Flash.

161
00:08:37,933 --> 00:08:39,059
He's here.

162
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:52,912
Oh, my God!

163
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,163
Christina McGee.

164
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:56,668
Who are you?

165
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,961
You're coming with me.

166
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,005
Flash!

167
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,206
Eobard Thawne.

168
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,251
You know who I am?

169
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,711
You died!

170
00:09:05,544 --> 00:09:06,636
Good to know.

171
00:09:07,337 --> 00:09:11,342
And guess what, Flash?
I know what time period you're from.

172
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:17,140
So that means, very soon, you will die.

173
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,855
(GRUNTING)

174
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,028
No.

175
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:32,868
You okay, Barr?

176
00:09:33,405 --> 00:09:35,408
I'm good. Yeah, it's just a lot.

177
00:09:36,658 --> 00:09:37,534
Eddie Thawne died,

178
00:09:37,826 --> 00:09:42,048
so Eobard Thawne should've
been erased out of existence, right?

179
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,548
Not necessarily.

180
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,336
It is possible
Eobard was in the Speed Force,

181
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:50,724
protecting him like a bomb shelter,
keeping him alive and his time line intact.

182
00:09:51,006 --> 00:09:52,679
It's what's known as a "timeline remnant."

183
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:54,177
A... A what now?

184
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,721
Here, let me... show you.

185
00:09:57,013 --> 00:10:02,269
This, this is now.

186
00:10:02,851 --> 00:10:04,445
Here. Today.

187
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,403
This is the time Thawne comes from.

188
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,995
This is the moment
you all erased him from existence,

189
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:17,408
but since Thawne is from the future,
this is where his timeline begins.

190
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,043
That's why he's still alive.

191
00:10:19,409 --> 00:10:22,629
This Thawne has not yet traveled
back in time to kill Barry's mother,

192
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:25,086
he's here, now,
in this time period, for the first time,

193
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,375
timeline remnant.

194
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,923
Explains why nothing's changed.

195
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,221
Yeah, it also explains why
he didn't know my name

196
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,548
Or that we have met before.

197
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,341
To him, you hadn't. Not until the future.

198
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:38,013
If Thawne dies
before he can time travel again,

199
00:10:38,303 --> 00:10:39,931
will that save Barry's mother?

200
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,937
No. That's not how it works.

201
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,317
In her timeline,
Barry's mother's already dead,

202
00:10:44,601 --> 00:10:46,946
and her death is a fixed point.
Nothing can change that.

203
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:50,817
All right, well, I'm gonna end this.
Him. In this time, once and for all.

204
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:54,158
Let's find Dr. McGee, then we'll
figure out what to do about Thawne.

205
00:10:54,486 --> 00:10:55,488
Okay?

206
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,573
I gotta go check on Iris.

207
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,326
Ramon.

208
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,792
Caitlin, I know you're worried
about Dr. McGee,

209
00:11:07,082 --> 00:11:08,254
but we're gonna get her back.

210
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,508
It's not that. It's Jay.

211
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,839
- What about Jay?
- He's sick.

212
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,974
And it's getting worse.

213
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:19,850
When Zoom stole his speed,
it affected him on a cellular level.

214
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,102
We need to do something about it.

215
00:11:22,472 --> 00:11:23,474
All right. Like what?

216
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:27,149
I think we should replace
his dying cells with healthy ones,

217
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:28,688
indistinguishable from his.

218
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,865
How do we do that?

219
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:33,283
We find his Earth-1 doppelganger.

220
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,321
There.

221
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,371
Tachyons?

222
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:43,500
A man in a yellow suit tried to
steal another tachyon prototype last year.

223
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,003
(CHUCKLES)

224
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:46,789
I must have gotten stuck here once before

225
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,379
and not been able to access
enough of the Speed Force.

226
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:51,673
Tachyons should do it.

227
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:54,756
I want you to isolate and accelerate
their energetic properties for me.

228
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,345
I don't know if I can do that.

229
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:06,559
If you want to stay alive, learn.

230
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,071
Franny...

231
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,240
Hey. (EXHALES)

232
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,740
How you feeling today?

233
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:24,038
Better now.

234
00:12:28,163 --> 00:12:29,586
I'm gonna let you two talk, okay?

235
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,000
Okay.

236
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:36,505
(SOFTLY) Hey.

237
00:12:39,841 --> 00:12:41,094
Can I get you anything?

238
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,971
Oh, just that brother of yours,

239
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,892
so all of us
can be together for the first time.

240
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,186
Yeah, he should be here.

241
00:12:50,602 --> 00:12:52,446
Well, his mother's leaving him.

242
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,529
Can't blame him
for being angry about that.

243
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,864
I just wish he'd get all that anger out
while I'm here to help.

244
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,616
Same thing goes for you, Iris.

245
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:11,048
One thing you learn when you're dying
is not to hold anything back.

246
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:18,764
You want to say something to me,
you need to say it while you can.

247
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:30,894
I have so many great memories
from when I grew up.

248
00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:35,818
Now, when I think about those memories,
I can only wonder

249
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,610
what it would've been like
if you and Wally would've been there.

250
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:44,325
I'm not angry at you anymore
for what happened.

251
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,754
I just wish
you would've come back to us a lot sooner,

252
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:57,091
because I would have forgiven you then,
just like I'm forgiving you now.

253
00:13:58,921 --> 00:13:59,797
Mmm...

254
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,056
Thank you.

255
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:02,341
Thank you.

256
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:18,365
(CRYING)

257
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:22,866
I don't know why this is so hard.
I barely even know her.

258
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,547
The facial recognition software
at S.T.A.R. Labs

259
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,001
didn't find anything either.

260
00:14:34,289 --> 00:14:36,133
No, but there's still
more databases to check.

261
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,509
We'll find his doppelganger.

262
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:38,669
- Thanks, Barry.
- Yeah.

263
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:39,961
PATTY: Hey.

264
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,547
Hi, Caitlin.

265
00:14:41,838 --> 00:14:42,840
Hi.

266
00:14:43,131 --> 00:14:44,929
Uh, can we talk?

267
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,811
Uh, yeah. Yeah, for sure.

268
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,846
Um, I'll let you know what I find.

269
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,309
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

270
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,057
What's up?

271
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,816
I didn't know you were
working with S.T.A.R. Labs.

272
00:14:56,562 --> 00:15:02,318
Yeah... Um, yeah, Joe and I
help out every once in a while.

273
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,028
Really?

274
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:07,787
Yeah, I probably shouldn't tell you this,
but there's a lot of weird stuff

275
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,417
that happens over there. (CHUCKLES)

276
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,543
(CHUCKLES)

277
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,913
Is that what you came to tell me?

278
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:17,837
Um...

279
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:23,514
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) You're just rolling
with the whole me-leaving thing.

280
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,884
Yeah, I mean...
I don't know what to tell you, Patty.

281
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:30,931
Everyone in my life that I love
leaves at some point.

282
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:32,514
Kind of getting used to it.

283
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,852
You never told me you love me.

284
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,902
Yeah. I guess I don't get that chance now.

285
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:45,946
I don't understand. What is it?
What's going on with you?

286
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,621
Why are you being like this?

287
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:51,668
My life... It's complicated.
And I don't want you to have regrets.

288
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:56,297
I don't want you to miss out on something
that you've always wanted to do, and...

289
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:01,885
I wish that things were different
for both of us.

290
00:16:03,962 --> 00:16:07,136
You know, but they're not. Sorry.

291
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,721
Me, too.

292
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,533
So, what did you do to my goggles?

293
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:33,826
I added a wavelength trigger to stimulate
the fear receptors in your brain.

294
00:16:34,659 --> 00:16:37,459
And then, I took what you already had
to induce slow-wave sleep,

295
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:40,169
upgraded it to get you
to stage four sleep.

296
00:16:40,665 --> 00:16:42,463
Now, this is good,
this will give us more control.

297
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,753
- Okay.
- Now, I'll be able

298
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,341
to dictate how
long you vibe for.

299
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:47,423
Put 'em on.

300
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:48,924
What am I gonna see?

301
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,014
I don't know. Never done this before.

302
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:53,600
You'll have to tell me
so I can steer you where you need to be.

303
00:16:55,597 --> 00:17:00,695
Ramon, if you want to find Reverse-Flash,
put on the goggles.

304
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:03,940
Okay.

305
00:17:04,272 --> 00:17:05,365
Atta boy.

306
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:08,781
(SIGHS)

307
00:17:10,153 --> 00:17:11,154
Go ahead.

308
00:17:19,704 --> 00:17:24,050
(LAUGHS) Oh, yeah, man.
I'm in full-on vibe mode right now.

309
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,423
What do you see?

310
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:26,678
It's hard to explain.

311
00:17:26,878 --> 00:17:29,883
It's different events.
Different events in time.

312
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:32,676
Concentrate on the Reverse-Flash.

313
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:33,970
Okay.

314
00:17:37,472 --> 00:17:38,473
I see him.

315
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:40,268
Move toward him.

316
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,653
Okay. Now what?

317
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,989
Try to picture him with Christina McGee.

318
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:52,288
Where the hell am I?

319
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,950
It's charged. You can go now.

320
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:57,955
You said you'd release me.

321
00:17:58,493 --> 00:18:01,212
Yes, I did, didn't I?

322
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,167
No!

323
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,337
(PANTING)

324
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:12,807
Well, what is it?

325
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:14,634
She's dead.

326
00:18:20,807 --> 00:18:22,184
Dr. McGee is dead?

327
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:28,115
Harry and I were trying to hone my powers
to find Zoom.

328
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,777
And then we ended up
using them finding the Reverse-Flash,

329
00:18:31,067 --> 00:18:33,490
and that's when I saw him kill her.

330
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:35,323
And then he left.

331
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,366
He left? What do you mean, he left?

332
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,952
McGee built him
some kind of speed machine,

333
00:18:40,243 --> 00:18:42,541
and he ran into it
and got flung back to the future.

334
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:43,705
(SIGHS)

335
00:18:43,913 --> 00:18:46,587
You'd need superluminal energy
to send someone through time.

336
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,252
- You mean like tachyons?
- Tachyons.

337
00:18:49,377 --> 00:18:52,382
Wait, we can track their location
once they've been activated.

338
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,761
- Anything?
- Nothing.

339
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,596
Cisco, you're sure that's what you saw?

340
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,391
- I'm positive.
- All right.

341
00:19:01,848 --> 00:19:02,895
What else did you see?

342
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:05,528
There was all sorts of weird
tech everywhere. There was a clock.

343
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,233
What time did the clock say?

344
00:19:09,522 --> 00:19:12,241
9:52, I think. How is that relevant?

345
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:13,698
It's 6:00 now.

346
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,830
Are you telling me I can see the future?

347
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,240
That's exactly what I'm telling you.

348
00:19:19,407 --> 00:19:20,910
Those goggles are getting
named immediately.

349
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,749
But that means Dr. McGee's alive.

350
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,079
That's right.

351
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,419
Okay, we have 3 hours,
52 minutes to find her

352
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,424
and stop Reverse-Flash.
Let's do it.

353
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:33,088
JOE: Spivot.

354
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:34,382
Hey.

355
00:19:34,589 --> 00:19:35,967
Can't get away from
those case files, huh?

356
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,181
Ah, just following up on a hunch.

357
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:39,891
You're gonna miss the action, right?

358
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,143
Maybe. A little.

359
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:44,933
I'm gonna miss you.

360
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:46,394
I'll miss you, too.

361
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,612
It's nice to know someone will.

362
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,650
Wait, we talking about Barry? 'Cause it
sounds like we're talking about Barry.

363
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:54,615
He kept telling me there was stuff
he couldn't share with me,

364
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:58,280
and I've been going a little crazy
trying to figure out what that stuff is.

365
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:01,325
Yeah. Barry's not great at sharing.

366
00:20:02,617 --> 00:20:03,618
Neither are you.

367
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:04,787
What do you mean?

368
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:06,296
Barry just told me that, you know,

369
00:20:06,579 --> 00:20:10,174
sometimes he helps you out
with S.T.A.R. Labs stuff.

370
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,678
Yeah, he does,
when he has a few extra minutes.

371
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,131
I didn't know that. I mean,
the whole time I've been working here,

372
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:16,970
you never mentioned it to me.

373
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:20,432
But then I realized why.

374
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:23,640
I went through some of Barry's old cases.

375
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:27,394
All of them involved The Flash
saving the day,

376
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:32,030
with details that Barry
couldn't have possibly even known.

377
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,315
That's weird.

378
00:20:34,607 --> 00:20:37,952
Yeah, it... It is weird.

379
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:42,616
The only thing that does make sense
is that Barry is The Flash.

380
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:45,376
Have you ever seen Barry run?

381
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,837
He waddles. Like a slow-ass duck.

382
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:49,624
There's no way he's The Flash, Patty.

383
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:51,003
You know, when I started this job,

384
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,545
you told me I had to learn
how to lie to do it.

385
00:20:54,377 --> 00:20:55,721
You're a terrible liar, Joe.

386
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,508
See you.

387
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:09,644
Nice nitrous kit.

388
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:12,070
You're gonna get caught one of
these days. You know that, right?

389
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,355
Get thrown in jail?

390
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:16,988
I'll stop racing
when these hospital bills stop coming in.

391
00:21:17,984 --> 00:21:20,407
I saw Mom today.
She says you haven't been by in a while.

392
00:21:20,695 --> 00:21:21,696
Yeah. She knows why.

393
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,537
She thinks it's because
you're angry with her.

394
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,374
I have every right to be angry.
Nothing for 20 years.

395
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:30,084
Then out of nowhere, she tells me
I have a sister. I have a father.

396
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,670
Yeah, the same thing
happened to me, too, remember?

397
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,627
But that shouldn't keep you
from seeing her before you can't anymore.

398
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,594
No, look, that's not what it is.

399
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:40,097
Then what is it, Wally?

400
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,842
I gotta go.

401
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:46,181
Last year, my fiancé died.

402
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:49,057
Unexpectedly.

403
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:54,859
One moment he was here, the next, gone.

404
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:58,241
I didn't get a chance
to say goodbye to him,

405
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,615
to tell him everything
that he meant to me,

406
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,369
that he was my world,

407
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,248
that he was loved.

408
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:10,416
But today, I got to say goodbye
to your mom. My mom.

409
00:22:11,704 --> 00:22:14,878
And it helped us both find peace
with what happened to our family.

410
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,554
Wally, don't make a mistake
you're gonna regret the rest of your life.

411
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:21,720
Go, see your mom, while you still can.

412
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,439
No sign of tachyon activity.

413
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,362
We're running out of time.
We've gotta find them.

414
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:38,444
It'll take a few minutes for the device
to reach full power once it's activated,

415
00:22:38,731 --> 00:22:40,575
but when we find it,
you're gonna have to get there fast.

416
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:42,577
- Hey, Barry.
- (SCOFFS) Yeah.

417
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:45,781
Have you found out anything else
about Jay's doppelganger?

418
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:48,826
There's no Jay Garrick on this earth.

419
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:51,086
It's so weird.
Everyone has a doppelganger.

420
00:22:52,078 --> 00:22:55,628
Maybe just ask Jay. He's a good guy.

421
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,131
Just ask him. I'm sure he'll tell you.

422
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:00,253
Okay.

423
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:02,673
Hey.

424
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:04,133
Hold on. What's up?

425
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:08,728
We got a problem.
Patty knows you're The Flash.

426
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:10,640
- What?
- She caught me off guard,

427
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:12,691
I mean, I played it off, but
come on, she's a smart girl.

428
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:15,648
And, she was going through some case
files, and you were acting all squirrelly.

429
00:23:15,935 --> 00:23:17,858
- This is my fault now?
- No, it's nobody's fault.

430
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:19,147
Oh, my God.

431
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:20,824
Maybe you should tell her.

432
00:23:21,107 --> 00:23:22,484
- No.
- Patty's trustworthy.

433
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:24,028
It's not even about that, Joe. I...

434
00:23:24,819 --> 00:23:27,368
I don't want another person that Zoom,
or Reverse-Flash,

435
00:23:27,655 --> 00:23:31,330
or any of these meta-humans,
can use against me. I don't want it.

436
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:33,537
Patty can't get hurt over this.

474
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:11,319
No, you're not.

475
00:26:12,278 --> 00:26:14,498
The more he learns about you,
the more you will alter the timeline.

476
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:15,953
He killed my mom!

477
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,834
He's from the future,
he hasn't done that yet.

478
00:26:18,117 --> 00:26:20,496
He doesn't even know you're The Flash,
and you need to keep it that way.

479
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:22,961
You already said that his mother's
gonna die no matter what we do.

480
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,875
Ramifications,
any time anybody messes with the timeline.

481
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:28,967
And it's impossible to predict
what those ramifications are gonna be.

482
00:26:29,253 --> 00:26:32,974
Barry, you caught him, and you
stopped him from killing Dr. McGee.

483
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,177
In my book, that's a win.

484
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:37,311
This doesn't feel like a win.

(CELL PHONE VIBRATES)

486
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:41,773
I gotta go.

487
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,449
So, what'd you want to talk to me about?

488
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:02,171
My dad had Multiple Sclerosis.

489
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:08,048
Every day, for years,
I watched this amazingly strong man

490
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:11,305
fight for his life, and lose.

491
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:17,387
So I can't sit by and watch another man
I care about fight for his life

492
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:19,392
and not do something about it.

I tried to find your doppelganger.

494

Same DNA, same cellular structure.

495
00:27:25,059 --> 00:27:28,564
I could replace your dying cells
with his living ones.

496
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:34,746
But you don't have
a doppelganger on this earth.

497
00:27:35,069 --> 00:27:37,367
Caitlin, there is a good explanation.

498
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:40,285
Meet me at Hofherr Park tomorrow,
and I'll show you.

499
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:41,576
Why can't you just tell me?

500
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,496
Because you need to see for yourself.

Who are you?

00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:04,813
My name is Cisco Ramon.

505
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:08,569
And we know each other well, don't we?
We have a history together.

506
00:28:08,936 --> 00:28:10,028
You could say that.

507
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:13,733
And that's all you want to know?
How I got my suit in my ring?

508
00:28:15,067 --> 00:28:19,243
I want you to know that I'm the one
who figured out you were back.

509
00:28:20,531 --> 00:28:23,957
I helped stop you. Me.

510
00:28:25,369 --> 00:28:26,461
And how'd you do that?

511
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:27,913
I have powers.

512
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,798
And I helped track you down
and I put you in here.

513
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:38,343
That's quite the ability
you've been given.

514
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:40,307
And here's what's so ironic about it.

515
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:43,806
You gave me these powers.

516
00:28:46,807 --> 00:28:47,775
Have fun thinking about that

517
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:51,439
while you rot away in this cell
that you helped me build.

518
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:55,400
Bye, Felicia.

- Hey.
- Got your text.

521
00:29:25,763 --> 00:29:27,391
I wasn't sure that you would see me,

522
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:29,902
considering
you've been avoiding me lately.

523
00:29:30,184 --> 00:29:32,653
Patty, I haven't been avoiding you.

524
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:39,487
No. Just, busy, you know,
speeding around Central City.

525
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,249
I know you're The Flash, Barry.

526
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:45,534
Patty, come on.

527
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:48,045
Please don't make me feel any
more stupid than I already do.

528
00:29:48,202 --> 00:29:50,705
Look, I'm a detective and
I should have known.

529
00:29:51,205 --> 00:29:52,833
I was so smitten with you.

530
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:57,172
Okay, look,
what you're saying, it's insane.

531
00:29:57,461 --> 00:29:59,259
Look, you don't have to
lie to me anymore, okay?

532
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:03,097
I understand, I understand why you didn't
want to tell me.

533
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:06,388
I understand why you've been distant.
Look, I understand everything.

534
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:10,020
But just tell me the truth now.
Just be honest with me. Just...

535
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:14,230
Admit to me you're The Flash,
and I'll stay.

536
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:16,523
I can't do that. I'm not him.

537
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:23,701
That's too bad.
It would've been nice to stay.

Fight crime during the day,
and be with you at night,

539
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:31,038
but I was wrong. Take care, Barry.

540
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:47,104
Is that you, Flash?

541
00:30:48,262 --> 00:30:49,935
Why do you hate me so much?

542
00:30:51,098 --> 00:30:52,270
I didn't always.

543
00:30:56,104 --> 00:31:01,280
I was obsessed with you.
For so long, I wanted to be The Flash.

544
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:05,117
I spent years figuring out
how you came to be,

545
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:10,126
duplicated the reaction, and it worked.

(LAUGHS)

547
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,580
I became like you.

548

All right, so what happened?

This ability to travel through time
revealed the truth.

550
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:27,394
My fate was to become your greatest enemy.
I was never going to be The Flash.

551
00:31:28,135 --> 00:31:30,684
So I became the reverse
of everything that you were.

552
00:31:31,263 --> 00:31:34,814
The more people you saved,
the more you were loved,

553
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:37,025
the more I had to take from you.

554
00:31:37,686 --> 00:31:42,989
That is why you killed my mother?
That's why you ruined my life?

555
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,613
Because you couldn't be me?

556
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:48,243

There's no way it'll reach the speed

- You can.
- What?

Your speed coupled with Thawne's speed,

599
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,442
that'll be enough to catapult him
through the time continuum. You can do it.

Don't worry about it.

No. I came up with a different method.

All you have to do is provide him
with enough momentum

617
00:34:54,134 --> 00:34:55,726
to get him past the space-time barrier.

618
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:56,978
All right.

619
00:34:57,177 --> 00:34:59,351
Hey, listen to me.
Thawne knows about you.

Right here, right now.

621
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,938
This is where he learns about you,
all of you.

622
00:35:06,228 --> 00:35:09,072
It's how he knows about S.T.A.R. Labs,
how he knows about me,

623
00:35:09,773 --> 00:35:13,699
the Harrison Wells from this earth.
And there's nothing I can do about it.

624
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:19,246
There's nothing you can do about it.
This is his origin story.

625
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:23,001
And it's going to happen
no matter what you do.

626
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:30,297
But right here, right now,
you can send him back to his time.

627
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:35,016
You can save your friend,
you can save Cisco.

And then move on with your life.

00:35:38,385 --> 00:35:42,106
This could be a good thing.
You can finally let go of him.

630
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:46,027
I could throw him three centuries
from now, he'll always be a part of me.

631
00:35:49,938 --> 00:35:51,782
Time to send you back where you belong.

632
00:35:58,155 --> 00:35:59,873
We'll meet again soon, Flash.

633
00:36:00,532 --> 00:36:03,661
I know. And every time,
I'll be ready for you.

634
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:25,730
Hurry!

635
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:54,086
He did it.

636
00:37:00,592 --> 00:37:01,684
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

637
00:37:15,315 --> 00:37:16,693
He's gonna be okay.

638
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,000
CAITLYN:
I don't understand what we're doing here.

639
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:31,713
Just like you, I thought that if I could
find my doppelganger on this earth,

640
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,173
I could replace my damaged cells
with some of his healthy ones.

641
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:38,222
Believe me, I was just as shocked as you

642
00:37:38,505 --> 00:37:42,010
when I couldn't find
a Jay Garrick anywhere on this planet.

643
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:50,106
Took me a while to figure it out.
But eventually, I found him.

644
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,530
His name is Hunter Zolomon.

645
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:58,735
Hunter Zolomon?
Why doesn't he have the same name as you?

646
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:01,996
From what I could gather,
his mother died during childbirth.

647
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,907
He bounced around from family to family

648
00:38:04,114 --> 00:38:06,867
but eventually was adopted
and raised by the Zolomons.

649
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:12,088
Why does that mean he can't help you?

650
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:15,547
My DNA was mutated
when I became a speedster.

651
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:20,385
There's only one way to reverse
what's happening to me.

652
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:24,603
If we can catch Zoom,
I can get my speed back.

653
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:27,476
Then let's finally figure out
the best way to do that.

654
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:31,016
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

655
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:42,240
- Wally, hi.
- Hey.

656
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:44,405
Um, do you wanna come in?

657
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:46,498
(STUTTERING) No, I can't stay. I Just...

658
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:50,333
I wanted to tell you that I'm gonna
take your advice, go see my mom.

659
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:52,454
Okay.

660
00:38:55,916 --> 00:39:00,764
Iris, I was...
I was wondering if you would come with me?

661
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:04,141
Yeah, yeah, I would love that.

662
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,264
- Yeah?
- Okay. Um...

663
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:08,637
(IRIS WEST SIGHS)

664
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:14,061
(GROANING)

665
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:16,858
My head feels like it's in a vise.

666
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:21,280
What happened?

667
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:25,284
I think you vibed one too many dimensions.

668
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,577
Maybe I should stop doing that.

669
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:28,907
(JOE LAUGHS)

670
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:30,539
Yeah, he's gonna be fine.

671
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:34,289
How did you, um, get the vibing to stop?

672
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:36,750
We sent Thawne back to his time.

673
00:39:39,501 --> 00:39:40,503
You let him go?

674
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:43,007
I couldn't let him take another person
I cared about.

675
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:48,101
Thank you.

676
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:49,304
Of course.

677
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:54,271
Okay. I think I need a Big Belly burger.
Anyone?

678
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:56,652
- I'm good, thank you.
- Yeah, no pickles.

679
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:58,438
Two triple-triples. Please.

680
00:39:58,646 --> 00:39:59,646
You got money?

681
00:40:00,273 --> 00:40:01,525
Mmm-mmm...

682
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:03,612
Rest up, all right? I'll be out here.

683
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:10,246
So, Patty,
she's on a train to Midway City right now?

684
00:40:10,532 --> 00:40:12,751
Mmm-hmm, I had to let her go, too.

685
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:15,835
Mmm, I was thinking about what you said,

686
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:22,630
about part of being The Flash is that you
have the ability to do amazing things

687
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,172
that nobody else can do.

688
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,132
And we see now that a hundred years
from now, you'll still be doing them.

689
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:31,724
But the other part is,
you're gonna be loaded with sacrifices,

690
00:40:32,429 --> 00:40:35,525
and you're gonna have
hard choices to make,

691
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:39,396
And there's gonna be a lot of things
where, eventually,

692
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:41,398
you'll have to let them go.

693
00:40:43,523 --> 00:40:44,570
You gotta be ready for that.

694
00:40:47,402 --> 00:40:49,576
I am. I'm ready.

695
00:40:51,114 --> 00:40:52,115
That's my boy.

696
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:54,494
(CHUCKLES)

697
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:56,420
(PHONE BUZZING)

698
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:00,000
That's weird.

699
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:02,717
Hey.

700
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:05,297
Barry, I'm on the train.
There's a... there's a man with a gun.

701
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:07,965
All right, hold on. I'll get you help.

702
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:16,807
Is everyone okay?

703
00:41:17,182 --> 00:41:18,309
PATTY: Everyone's fine.

704
00:41:20,143 --> 00:41:25,570
It was a false alarm.
But thanks for coming so fast, Flash.

705
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:34,076
I just want to make sure
everything's okay before I go.

706
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:39,206
Don't worry. Everything's good.

707
00:41:41,456 --> 00:41:42,753
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

708
00:41:55,929 --> 00:41:57,351
Goodbye, Barry.
