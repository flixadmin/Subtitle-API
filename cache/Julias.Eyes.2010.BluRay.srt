1
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:45,020
Listen to me.

2
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:47,981
OK, you win.

3
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:53,028
At least you could stop that song.
You know I hate it.

4
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:56,782
Why are you so quiet?

5
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:02,746
Say something!

6
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,118
You're there.

7
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,037
And you're looking at me.

8
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:28,415
Do you think you can fool me?

9
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,710
No, no, you can't fool me,

10
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:34,630
because I can feel your presence.

11
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:37,799
And your movements.

12
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:40,010
I can even smell you.

13
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,054
If you think...

14
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,640
If you think, son of a bitch,

15
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:47,476
that I'll hang myself
while you watch, you...

16
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,501
- What's wrong?
- What happened?

17
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,795
Julia, what's wrong?

18
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:18,006
Julia, can you hear me?
Bring some water.

19
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,883
Take it easy, Julia.

20
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:22,844
Julia, are you OK?

21
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,304
- What happened?
- She fell.

22
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:27,683
- Call a doctor, quick!
- No, I'm OK.

23
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,977
I'm OK.

24
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:38,986
This is Sara. I can't take your call
at the moment. Please...

25
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,950
Do you think it's a good idea
to show up after six months?

26
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:47,536
I just need to know
that she is all right.

27
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:55,127
Sara?

28
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,506
Maybe they have gone out.

29
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:00,966
No...

30
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,343
I know something's happened to her.

31
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,106
The power is out.

32
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:22,321
- The fuses seem to be OK.
- I'll look upstairs.

33
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:28,804
Sara?

34
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:05,739
Isaac, she's nowhere to be found.
We'll ask the neighbours.

35
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:08,241
- Don't come down.
- Why?

36
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,913
What's wrong?

37
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,585
Isaac, tell me what's wrong.

38
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,671
- What's wrong?
- Julia...

39
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,174
- What's wrong?
- Come with me.

40
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,146
Inspector...

41
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:40,816
I'm sorry about what happened.

42
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,734
No, thanks.

43
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:47,531
The forensics say Sara took her own life
last night, during the blackout.

44
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:49,783
But we need to find out why.

45
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:53,370
I have been informed that she suffered
a degenerative disease.

46
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:58,250
Yes, a progressive vision loss,
the same as my wife.

47
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,753
But Sara went blind a year ago.

48
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,089
And how did she cope with that?

49
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:08,301
My sister wasn't depressed,
if that's what you mean.

50
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,595
In fact, she was...

51
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:13,390
She was going to have surgery, right?

52
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,727
She was waiting for a donor,
but she hoped to get her vision back.

53
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:27,362
Maybe she got tired of waiting.

54
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:00,729
All right.

55
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,400
Yes, thank you.

56
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:13,158
Dr Román can't come to the funeral,
and he sends his condolences.

57
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,912
He also wants to check your eyes
before you go back home.

58
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:20,123
Isaac, the power is back.

59
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,711
Darling, are you listening?

60
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,797
And the CD started playing.
Did you hear it?

61
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,968
- Yes.
- Don't you think it's strange

62
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:35,222
that Sara was listening
to music before...?

63
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:37,682
Besides, she hated that song.

64
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,393
- Julia...
- What if she wasn't alone?

65
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:43,313
- What if she was with somebody?
- Julia, please.

66
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:47,692
We may never find out her reasons.
We hadn't heard from her in months.

67
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:50,320
It's strange.
I need to know what happened.

68
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:54,032
- It's not good for you to get upset.
- I'm not worried about myself.

69
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,578
Well, I am.
Stress can turn you blind.

70
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:01,581
It's only happened to me
twice in five years.

71
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:04,626
And you've lost 20% of your vision.

72
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:17,097
Oh, no... Again.

73
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,198
Did you find anything?

74
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,159
Nothing, not even a candle.

75
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:42,289
- It's time to meet the neighbours.
- OK, hurry up.

76
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:07,814
Isaac?

77
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,213
Julia.

78
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:10,418
Excuse me.

79
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,593
I'm sorry for your loss.
I'm Blasco, her next-door neighbour.

80
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,554
I didn't know your sister very well,

81
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:26,768
but Lía loved her very much
and she wanted me to bring you this.

82
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:28,645
Lía?

83
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:32,816
My daughter.
Sara used to lend her books.

84
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:38,113
The poor girl is so upset she didn't
want to come out of the car.

85
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,241
Anyway...

86
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:46,955
Sorry... Lía would like to know
if Sara left any note.

87
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:51,960
- We don't know.
- I understand.

88
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:55,755
Anyway, I won't bother you any longer.

89
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,722
Shall we continue?

90
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,182
Only a neighbour and his daughter?

91
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:11,104
I didn't know she was so lonely.

92
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,492
But I forgave her.

93
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:30,123
And I also forgave you.

94
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:38,840
Now I only need to forgive myself
for not being by her side.

95
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:51,102
But I did everything I could,
didn't I, Isaac?

96
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,246
The autopsy doesn't reveal
anything strange.

97
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:15,168
- Have you searched for fingerprints?
- We only found ours and hers.

98
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,170
OK, but...

99
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,255
That song...

100
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,841
And what about what happened
in the cemetery?

101
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:26,805
Julia, there's no evidence
of anyone being with your sister.

102
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:30,350
And nobody has seen or heard
anything suspicious.

103
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:35,688
You can speak with Soledad if you wish.

104
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:38,942
- With whom?
- An old lady who lives nearby.

105
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:43,279
Apparently, she helped your sister
when she went blind.

106
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,907
Don't be long.

107
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,581
Where does she live?

108
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:56,751
Follow the rope in the yard.

109
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,253
What rope?

110
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:12,934
I'm sure the old woman
doesn't know anything.

111
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:16,229
Nobody else knew apart from you.

112
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:21,192
But you have to speak with your wife.
She'll find out sooner or later.

113
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:24,904
I'll wait for the right moment.

114
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:56,185
Mrs Soledad?

115
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:04,402
Hello?

116
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,157
Who is it?

117
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,284
It's Julia, Sara's sister.

118
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,119
I'll be right out.

119
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:22,921
Sorry about the mess.
The house must be quite disgusting.

120
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,508
Hello...

121
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:32,722
- Are you there?
- Yes. Sorry, I didn't know you were...

122
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:37,894
I am sorry too. I wanted to come
to your sister's funeral, but...

123
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:41,105
it took me an hour to find
a pair of matching shoes.

124
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,774
It's OK.

125
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,818
Were you a good friend of Sara?

126
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:49,781
Well, when she started
losing her eyesight,

127
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:54,827
a year ago,
we used to have long conversations.

128
00:15:56,872 --> 00:16:00,375
But lately she hardly spoke with me.

129
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,877
She had made new friends.

130
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:07,465
- What new friends?
- You know, younger people.

131
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:11,844
- From the Baumann Centre.
- Baumann Centre. What's that?

132
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,681
A centre for blind people,
not far from here.

133
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:21,062
One of those places where they make you
believe you can live a normal life.

134
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:25,900
If you can't hear, you are deaf.
If you lost an arm, you are a cripple.

135
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,861
And if you can't see, you are blind.

136
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,948
And nothing can ever be
how it used to be.

137
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:36,244
Mrs Soledad, where can I take a taxi?

138
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,079
Thank you.

139
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:46,421
Go straight ahead,
down the stairs and turn right.

140
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,652
Poor Sara.

141
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:13,156
- Why would she hang herself?
- Stop thinking about it.

142
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:16,117
- Shall we have a moment of silence?
- Don't be cruel.

143
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,995
None of us could stand her.

144
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:21,748
Don't you find it strange?

145
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,291
No.

146
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,501
We've all thought
of doing it at some time.

147
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:28,629
Dela...

148
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:32,258
Nora is right. I once thought
of slitting my wrists.

149
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:35,803
With candles and opera music.

150
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:38,598
Me too, I thought of jumping
out of the window.

151
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:41,809
Well, we thought about it
but didn't do it.

152
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:44,979
There's a reason to live.

153
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,940
Maybe Sara didn't find any.

154
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:52,528
And a boyfriend doesn't seem like
a good reason?

155
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,906
Sara had a boyfriend?

156
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,033
She told me she met a boy.

157
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,243
- Who?
- No idea.

158
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:02,955
They had been going out together
for a couple of months.

159
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:06,375
They even went to Bellavista
together for a week.

160
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,547
- What's in Bellavista?
- Rooms for sex.

161
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,343
Quiet!

162
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:26,562
How weird! Shit!

163
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,397
What is it?

164
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:31,025
There's someone here.

165
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:34,862
- I would say it's Sara.
- That's not funny!

166
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:39,575
- I can smell her too.
- Something is moving.

167
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:44,122
- I've got her! Call security!
- I'm Sara's sister.

168
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,873
Julia?

169
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,917
Yes.

170
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:52,130
- Why were you spying on us?
- I just didn't want to interrupt.

171
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,133
- And who is he?
- Who?

172
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,552
- The man who came with you.
- I came alone.

173
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,888
There's someone else here.

174
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:03,850
A man, and he's right behind you.

175
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,288
Wait!

176
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:55,962
Who are you?

177
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:01,634
Turn around.

178
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,344
I said turn around!

179
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:42,300
No, no!

180
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,169
Isaac?

181
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:31,599
Hotel Romeo, Bellavista.

182
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:35,770
What happened to you?

183
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:38,397
You are soaking wet.

184
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:41,317
It started raining
when I left Soledad's house.

185
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:44,487
Have you been with her all this time?

186
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:49,116
She invited me for tea.
I couldn't say no.

187
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:54,455
Julia, I went to look for you.
You left her place an hour ago.

188
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:57,166
Where have you been?

189
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,502
Why are you so controlling?

190
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:02,338
I could also ask you
what you're looking for.

191
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:09,970
Fine.

192
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,808
Now I'm certain there was
something strange in Sara's suicide.

193
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:18,646
- There's someone watching us.
- Julia, Julia, please.

194
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,106
Who?

195
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:25,277
Her boyfriend.

196
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,488
- Sara had a boyfriend?
- Yes.

197
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:28,656
Who told you?

198
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:31,200
A group of blind girls told me
at the Baumann Centre

199
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,160
and someone was spying on us.

200
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:35,955
- How do you know?
- Because I ran after him.

201
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:39,166
- You ran after him?
- Yes, I did.

202
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:40,918
Isaac.

203
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:45,005
- Isaac! What are you doing?
- We're leaving this house.

204
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:48,759
Listen to me. If I have to be
a controlling husband, I will be.

205
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:51,137
And if I have to drag you out of here,
I will too.

206
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:54,098
But I won't let you have a seizure.

207
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:57,143
You know I would never
forgive myself.

208
00:23:57,602 --> 00:24:00,229
Your sister's death has hurt us enough.

209
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:10,072
You're right.

210
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:13,659
But I don't feel like
going back home.

211
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:18,038
Why don't we go somewhere,
you and me, alone?

212
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:30,801
Where would you like to go?

213
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:59,663
- Are you sure you want to stay there?
- The guide says it's the cosiest hotel.

214
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:10,799
Nice view, isn't it?

215
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:15,429
- Julia.
- Yes, yes. It's beautiful.

216
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:16,972
Thank you.

217
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:19,517
Julia...

218
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:22,937
- I'll park the car.
- Yes, OK.

219
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:29,151
You don't remember my sister,
a blind woman?

220
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,987
Yes, a colleague talked to me about her.

221
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:33,739
This may sound weird,

222
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:37,076
but could you find out
the name of the man who was with her?

223
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:41,956
- There's no name on the receipt.
- Sorry, but I don't remember any man.

224
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,290
The thing is...

225
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:46,377
my sister is dead,
and I need to find this man.

226
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:49,505
Let me see... I don't understand.

227
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:52,258
Her booking is not registered.

228
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:55,970
It's as if all the information
was deleted.

229
00:25:56,137 --> 00:26:00,599
- Are you sure?
- Sorry. It must be a computer problem.

230
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:06,272
You could try El Arlequín. It's the
restaurant we recommend to our guests.

231
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:07,385
Thank you.

232
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:21,328
I don't understand how they can
recommend this restaurant.

233
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:23,414
I like it.

234
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:28,460
It's not your style at all.

235
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:35,593
And that waiter
won't stop staring at you.

236
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,469
Really?

237
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:46,312
- It's your imagination.
- Maybe.

238
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:54,653
- My reading glasses...
- In your coat? How weird.

239
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:59,325
I'll go and get them,
and I'll go to the toilet too.

240
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:04,038
If he hits on you, just yell.

241
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:16,759
What a change!

242
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:21,972
I like it. It highlights your eyes.
By the way, I knew they were green.

243
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:26,435
You're confusing me with my twin sister.
She was here last week.

244
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,562
With her boyfriend.

245
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:30,189
Her boyfriend?

246
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:32,733
She came with a man, didn't she?

247
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:35,819
Yes, I think so.

248
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:40,074
- Do you remember his name?
- No, no idea.

249
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:43,160
He was very quiet, very sad.

250
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:47,539
- Could you describe him?
- Sure, he was...

251
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,251
He was very plain,
like any other man.

252
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:54,588
But was he tall, short,
blond hair, dark hair?

253
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,802
I can't remember right now.

254
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:02,846
How can you remember my sister
but nothing about the man?

255
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:07,142
She drew a bit of attention
with that blindfold.

256
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:10,437
Blindfold?

257
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:13,732
She was bandaged after the operation.

258
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:20,447
- Did she have an operation?
- Of course.

259
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:22,616
Hence the bet over her eye colour.

260
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,910
She said she'd come
once she'd recovered,

261
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:27,246
and if I guessed her eye colour,
I could...

262
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:30,124
- Pablo, can you come for a second?
- Yes, sure.

263
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,543
Excuse me.
My greetings to her.

264
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:42,094
I couldn't find them.

265
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,306
Let's see how I manage.

266
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,981
Is something wrong?

267
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:01,989
Sara was here last week.

268
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:09,163
Julia... what are we doing here?

269
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:13,667
Isaac, the waiter told me
she had her eyes bandaged.

270
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,127
Do you realise?

271
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:20,507
If she had the operation and had
a chance to regain her sight,

272
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:23,719
why would she commit suicide?

273
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:26,680
Tell me why.

274
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,857
Because the operation didn't work.

275
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,611
What?

276
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,322
It didn't work.

277
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:48,160
Dr Román told me yesterday.

278
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:57,294
I was waiting for the right moment
to tell you.

279
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,900
That man exists.

280
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:22,778
Julia, Julia.

281
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:25,823
- Anything else I should know?
- I was only trying to protect you.

282
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:28,867
- From what?
- From the truth.

283
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:30,577
What's the truth?

284
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:35,874
Sara committed suicide because
she couldn't stand being blind.

285
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:48,637
Julia.

286
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,518
Did you know she came here
with her boyfriend?

287
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,270
That doesn't prove anything.

288
00:30:56,437 --> 00:31:01,942
And why is he hiding?
Why didn't he show up at the funeral?

289
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:04,820
Maybe he wasn't with her by then.

290
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:10,826
Maybe he left her when he found out
she'd never recover her sight.

291
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,706
That easy?

292
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,583
That easy, right?

293
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,127
- Well...
- I can't believe you're a psychologist.

294
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,421
Julia!

295
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:26,300
God!

296
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:32,139
What are you doing?

297
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,682
Julia, Julia.

298
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:35,601
Didn't you see the car?

299
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:44,318
You didn't see it, did you?

300
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:52,576
How many seizures have you had?

301
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:53,827
Two.

302
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:56,121
Shit!

303
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,166
Shit.

304
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:08,508
If...

305
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:14,056
- If I go blind... When I go blind...
- No, no. That won't happen.

306
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:19,269
Not wanting it
doesn't mean it won't happen.

307
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,694
Isaac...

308
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:33,492
One time you told me that...

309
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:39,456
...when you looked into my eyes,
you could see the entire universe.

310
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:45,712
- I still can.
- What if the universe shuts down?

311
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:53,261
Close your eyes.

312
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:56,139
What?

313
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:58,308
Close your eyes.

314
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,275
Can you see me?

315
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:10,904
Of course I can't.

316
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:15,575
Then how do you know
I'm still here with you?

317
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:18,245
Because I can hear you.

318
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:23,000
What if I remain silent?

319
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:25,836
How do you know I'm still here?

320
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:42,769
I can touch you.

321
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:48,066
And you can smell me.

322
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:52,779
And kiss you.

323
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:19,931
Promise me that when the day comes,
we will go back to the desert.

324
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:22,601
What?

325
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,770
You know?

326
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:29,274
The last thing I'd like to see
is that sky, with you.

327
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:33,320
- Julia...
- Promise me.

328
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:36,031
Promise me.

329
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,493
I promise you.

330
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,246
But...

331
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,999
But you have to promise me...

332
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,545
...that you will stop chasing ghosts.

333
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:54,382
And that we will go and see Dr Román.

334
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,177
Tomorrow.

335
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,806
OK.

336
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:22,035
I'll bring the luggage to the car.
I'll wait for you outside.

337
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:23,537
In 15 minutes.

338
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:38,927
Ms Levin.

339
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:42,556
I'm really sorry for your loss.

340
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:46,309
My name is Créspulo.

341
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:49,938
I read about your sister
in the obituaries section of the newspaper.

342
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,648
Thank you.

343
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:54,067
I have something of hers.

344
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:59,489
A few hours after your sister left,

345
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:05,162
I found a key in her room,
under the bed.

346
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,082
I think I put it here somewhere.

347
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,926
Thank you.

348
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:34,107
Mr Créspulo.

349
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,276
I'm sorry.

350
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:40,280
Mr Créspulo...

351
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,866
My sister came here with a man,
didn't she?

352
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,452
The invisible man.

353
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,123
I beg your pardon?

354
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:56,671
Nobody remembers the man
who came with your sister, right?

355
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:01,468
Well...

356
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,929
That doesn't mean he is invisible.

357
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,723
There are people with no light.

358
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:11,186
Do you know what it's like to walk in
somewhere and not be noticed?

359
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:17,567
Or to walk on the street
and have people stumble against you?

360
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:24,824
Or to ask something for the third time
and have no one answer your question?

361
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:27,494
That's the man you're looking for.

362
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:31,081
A pause, a vacuum.

363
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,000
An absence.

364
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:37,796
That's why nobody remembers him.

365
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,674
Nobody except you.

366
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:46,972
In a way, I am also invisible.

367
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:52,310
It's been many years since the last time
someone remembered me.

368
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:56,189
This man...

369
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:59,192
do you know where I can find him?

370
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,739
What are you afraid of?

371
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:10,662
He parked his van in a car park
two blocks down the street.

372
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:16,710
There's a CCTV camera
recording 24 hours a day.

373
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,005
Thank you.

374
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,965
Wait!

375
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:23,508
Be careful.

376
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:29,097
The man who was with your sister
had very angry eyes.

377
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,017
He knows how to be a shadow.

378
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:36,563
If someone feels invisible
and is angry at the world,

379
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,732
he can be dangerous.

380
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:41,318
He has no light.
Nobody looks at him.

381
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:44,946
He could sneak up on you and...

382
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,724
- Where have you been?
- Did you see anyone?

383
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:16,603
- I've been waiting for 10 minutes.
- Wait a moment.

384
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:19,856
He's here.
And I know how to find him.

385
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:26,237
- No!
- What are you doing?

386
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:29,032
- Let me talk to the guard.
- Will you calm down?

387
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,659
- Calm down!
- Wait here.

388
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:33,953
Don't be so rude!

389
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:37,290
I remind you
that you made a promise last night.

390
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:39,000
- Enough.
- I can't take it any more!

391
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:41,503
- I said don't yell at me!
- I've had it!

392
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,797
There's no mystery in Sara's death!

393
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:47,217
Do you want the footage?
You'll have it.

394
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:51,054
But this shit ends
right here, right now, all right?

395
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:15,662
You've reached...

396
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:42,564
Excuse me.

397
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:46,234
Has anyone been here
asking about security videos?

398
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:49,654
Look... I don't want any trouble, OK?

399
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,907
That guy came, gave me some money
and I promised to keep my mouth shut.

400
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:56,202
He is my husband.
I've been waiting for a while.

401
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,913
Do you know which way he went out?

402
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:04,210
He left as soon as my little friend
made the copies he wanted.

403
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:06,045
And...

404
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:08,214
Was there anyone else here?

405
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:10,300
- Are you sure?
- Nobody.

406
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:14,262
We can check the monitors
in case we see something.

407
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,848
What the hell?

408
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:24,898
I'll be right back.

409
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,696
Goddammit!

410
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,407
What's wrong?

411
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,166
Calm down. It's me.

412
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:45,376
Someone has switched off the power.

413
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:53,426
It's impossible.

414
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:21,579
My husband has been kidnapped.
He's in danger.

415
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:25,458
OK, the only thing we know is that
someone stole some CCTV footage.

416
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:30,838
No, I've already told you.
It was the man who was with my sister.

417
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:33,967
You have to find him
before it's too late.

418
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:39,180
How can we find someone
that nobody has seen, not even you?

419
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:45,728
Créspulo.

420
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:36,904
- He killed him because he was...
- No evidence of violence.

421
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:39,907
...the only who could recognise
the invisible man.

422
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:42,994
- He's erasing his tracks.
- What do you mean?

423
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:45,496
My husband is in danger!

424
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:48,041
- Calm down, madam!
- Isaac!

425
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:50,543
Call a doctor, quick.

426
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:53,546
We need a doctor down here.

427
00:43:57,676 --> 00:43:58,718
Isaac.

428
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:17,403
The process is irreversible.

429
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:19,280
How long do I have?

430
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:23,660
I don't know...
Perhaps a few hours, days.

431
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:26,746
Maybe a few weeks.
Definitely less than a month.

432
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:29,791
We have to find a donor
and operate as soon as possible.

433
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:31,751
Did you know Sara's boyfriend?

434
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,464
No, I didn't know him.

435
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:41,386
Julia, I know you're going through
a hard time,

436
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:44,514
but you have to think about yourself.

437
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:48,726
So, please,
try to avoid emotional stress.

438
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:52,313
And don't force your eyes. OK?

439
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,911
Iván. Iván.

440
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:23,469
A boyfriend?

441
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:26,931
Sara never told me
about any boyfriends.

442
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:29,726
She didn't trust men.

443
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:31,936
Unlike me.

444
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:34,897
- Or you.
- Isaac hasn't left me, I'm sure.

445
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:38,025
That's what all women think.

446
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:42,447
I also came up with a story
when my husband left me.

447
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:46,576
He couldn't stand my son Ángel.

448
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:50,163
And my son was more important
than anything else.

449
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:55,793
Then my eyes started to degenerate
and I went blind.

450
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:59,380
Luckily, Ángel looked after me
for 10 years,

451
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:03,426
until I woke up one morning...

452
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,636
and he was gone.

453
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:07,847
My son was gone.

454
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:12,643
What kind of son abandons
a blind mother?

455
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:16,022
I had to come up with a story.

456
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:18,858
And I still keep to it.

457
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:23,070
Such humiliation!
I'm sorry.

458
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:34,207
Hello?

459
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:37,710
The hotel is fully automated.
There are no staff.

460
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:40,546
Guests check in through a machine.

461
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:44,217
They called from the bank this morning
to inform me about a transaction

462
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:46,552
with your husband's credit card.

463
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:51,557
I searched the room
and found this on the bedside table.

464
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:55,895
Julia, there's things about your husband
you don't know.

465
00:46:57,105 --> 00:47:01,359
- He kept Sara's surgery from you.
- To protect me. The doctor told me...

466
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:05,279
The doctor didn't talk to anybody
about the surgery.

467
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:09,408
How did your husband know?

468
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:15,706
Inspector, a patrol just drove by
Sara's house and saw light inside.

469
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,256
Isaac?

470
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:27,301
Wait here. Don't move.

471
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:01,127
Isaac?

472
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:23,149
Hello?

473
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:26,596
Isaac?

474
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,840
Julia!

475
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:51,928
Shit! I have to get out of here.

476
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:55,139
Where is it? Stay calm.

477
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:59,185
Where is the door? Stay calm.

478
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:03,147
Julia? Julia?

479
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:10,321
Inspector! There's somebody
down here. Inspector!

480
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:15,952
Julia, calm down. It's me.

481
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:25,044
There's somebody here.

482
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:39,058
What's wrong?

483
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:43,896
Turn on the torch.
I hate darkness.

484
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:48,693
Please, say something.
Why aren't you saying anything?

485
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,377
Thank you.

486
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:11,090
Hi.

487
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:18,014
There's something
you should know, Julia.

488
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,434
Your husband left a letter.

489
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:26,439
We checked the handwriting
and there is no doubt it's his.

490
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:29,233
Listen...

491
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:34,155
Sara and Isaac
had been lovers for six months.

492
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:37,616
He apologises in the letter.

493
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:44,123
That explains the numerous calls to her
we found on his mobile phone.

494
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:49,253
Did you know
they were in touch lately?

495
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:01,432
Think, Julia.

496
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:05,644
Did Isaac insist on getting the video?

497
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:10,316
Probably because he didn't want you
to see him on it.

498
00:51:11,526 --> 00:51:17,323
Then he went back to the motel and
decided he couldn't live without Sara.

499
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:23,662
I'm sorry, but everything makes sense.

500
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:40,596
We found a donor.
We can operate tomorrow.

501
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:43,099
You just have to sign here.

502
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:51,816
Thank you.

503
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:14,672
Calm down, Julia!

504
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:19,135
Calm down. Sleep a bit more.

505
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:25,683
OK, Julia... Everything went well.

506
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:29,228
But we have to be careful now.

507
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:33,649
You eyes must be protected
from the light for two weeks.

508
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:36,402
And don't manipulate
the bandages yourself.

509
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:40,698
If you remove them too soon,
there won't be a solution.

510
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:44,368
But don't worry,
you will be taken care of.

511
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:46,328
No.

512
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:49,415
I'd rather go home.
I hate hospitals.

513
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:52,334
I know,
but I'm afraid that's impossible.

514
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:57,381
- You need supervision.
- I could... go to my sister's house.

515
00:52:57,549 --> 00:53:00,259
I know my way around it very well.

516
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:05,097
Julia, honestly,
I don't think it's a good idea.

517
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:09,059
Right, but if I can't see, I can't feel.

518
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:16,192
All right, let's do this.
You can go to your sister's house.

519
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:20,571
But a care worker will visit you
every day, OK?

520
00:53:26,077 --> 00:53:29,538
Julia, there's something else.

521
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:34,793
Your husband's body is still here.
I can take care of it if you want.

522
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,754
No.

523
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:41,467
I'd rather do it myself.

524
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:45,804
Could you keep the body
until I can see again?

525
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:48,807
I need to say goodbye to him.

526
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:01,987
Let's sit on the sofa. Slowly.

527
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:04,073
Keep walking...

528
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:07,243
- Here are your things.
- Thank you.

529
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:11,997
- Careful. Don't worry.
- No problem.

530
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:18,921
Shall we wait here
until the care worker arrives?

531
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:21,882
- Can you do me a favour?
- Sure. What is it?

532
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:24,551
I'd like to know what this key opens.

533
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:38,816
Whatever it is this key opens,
it's not here.

534
00:54:38,984 --> 00:54:42,194
- Did you try every lock?
- I did.

535
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:44,697
Do you need anything else?

536
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:46,573
No, thank you.

537
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:49,368
- You can go.
- All right.

538
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:01,106
- Hello?
- Hi.

539
00:56:01,274 --> 00:56:04,485
You must be Julia.
I'm Iván, the care worker.

540
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:08,614
Sorry I'm late. The traffic was bad.
I phoned you, but it got cut off.

541
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:14,453
I would have preferred a woman.

542
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:19,500
If you want to call Dr Román...
What happened to your hand?

543
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:28,217
It's just a scratch. You won't
feel anything tomorrow morning.

544
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:33,639
I will make you dinner
and clean up a bit. You stay here.

545
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:36,266
By the way...

546
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:40,687
What should I do with the glasses?

547
00:56:40,855 --> 00:56:42,439
Throw them out.

548
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:50,197
While you ate,
I familiarised myself with the house.

549
00:56:51,157 --> 00:56:52,658
Julia.

550
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:58,622
- What are you doing?
- Sorry. I have to go.

551
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:00,624
What time is it?

552
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,835
It's nine o'clock.

553
00:57:03,002 --> 00:57:05,462
On the first days,
we lose track of time.

554
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:10,175
I'll give you a couple
of sleeping pills, just in case.

555
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:13,220
And also a pager.

556
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:17,182
If you want to contact me,
press this button. Give me your hand.

557
00:57:17,642 --> 00:57:20,436
Look, here's the button.

558
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:30,237
Let's go.

559
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:33,198
- What are you doing?
- I have to put you to bed.

560
00:57:33,741 --> 00:57:37,619
- Sorry, but I can do it myself.
- Are you sure?

561
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,380
Are you OK?

562
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:51,884
OK, you win.

563
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:54,136
Put me to bed and then you can go.

564
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,997
Who's there?

565
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:29,671
Calm down.
Calm down, darling.

566
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:32,341
It's me.

567
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:37,387
Isaac?

568
00:58:38,431 --> 00:58:40,682
How can this be?

569
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:48,732
Don't say anything.

570
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:51,818
Thank you.

571
00:58:53,279 --> 00:58:58,492
- What are you doing?
- Taking this dirty bandage off.

572
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:02,162
- So you can see me better.
- No!

573
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:05,999
That's it, that's it.

574
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:10,128
Leave me alone.
Get off me! Get off me!

575
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:16,385
Don't resist, little sister.
We're two against one.

576
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:22,891
Don't move.

577
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:25,060
No, stop!

578
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:28,647
Get off me!

579
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:07,352
Iván. Iván.

580
01:00:07,478 --> 01:00:09,688
Julia, is everything OK?

581
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:13,525
- I think there's someone in the house.
- What?

582
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:15,944
In the room next door.

583
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:20,365
- Don't move. I'll call the police.
- No, Iván, Iván.

584
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:36,506
Are you still there?

585
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:41,553
You have to get me out of here
right now.

586
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:45,057
- Where are you?
- In the guest room.

587
01:00:45,224 --> 01:00:47,976
That's good.
Find the door and get out of the room.

588
01:00:49,854 --> 01:00:52,439
Find the door to your right.

589
01:00:54,567 --> 01:00:56,109
- He's there.
- Calm down.

590
01:00:56,277 --> 01:00:59,112
The handrail is in front of you.
Look for it.

591
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,781
OK, yes.

592
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:03,241
Hold onto the handrail.

593
01:01:03,409 --> 01:01:06,411
Go down the six steps
to the first landing.

594
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,793
Then there's nine more.

595
01:01:15,254 --> 01:01:16,797
Julia...

596
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:23,095
- I'm downstairs. What now?
- Follow the wall to the door.

597
01:01:30,436 --> 01:01:32,312
Who are you?
Who are you?

598
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,272
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

599
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:37,109
Get out of the house! Quick!

600
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:57,129
There is no indication
that someone entered the house.

601
01:01:57,296 --> 01:02:00,966
There was someone there.
And he was looking for something.

602
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:04,636
Sorry, but there's nothing else
I can do.

603
01:02:08,474 --> 01:02:10,726
- Do you want me to call the hospital?
- Why?

604
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:14,646
Maybe you shouldn't recover here,
considering what you've been through.

605
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:16,648
You don't believe me either.

606
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:22,279
I'm just saying that in your situation,
it's normal if your senses deceive you.

607
01:02:22,488 --> 01:02:25,657
Don't open your eyes now.

608
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:29,578
You can let go now.

609
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:32,998
What's the matter?

610
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:36,877
My eyes could get damaged, right?

611
01:02:37,044 --> 01:02:41,840
No, I only want to change the bandage,
and I took precautions.

612
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:45,093
I've done this a hundred times.
Don't worry.

613
01:02:49,515 --> 01:02:52,267
You know, when I was 20 years old,

614
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:55,520
I had a car accident
and I was blind for two months.

615
01:02:57,523 --> 01:03:03,528
And like you now,
I imagined things and had nightmares.

616
01:03:03,696 --> 01:03:06,156
And I rejected the care worker's help.

617
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:11,536
I couldn't stand the idea
of going blind.

618
01:03:17,752 --> 01:03:20,212
In the end, I recovered my sight.

619
01:03:23,090 --> 01:03:25,717
But during those months...

620
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:30,263
...I understood what it was like
to live in the dark.

621
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:36,728
That's why I became a care worker.

622
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:40,273
You made that up
to make me feel better.

623
01:03:40,441 --> 01:03:43,985
No, no. Call the hospital
if you don't believe me.

624
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:50,158
Julia, I know you're scared,
but the only way to lose that fear

625
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:52,244
is to fight it.

626
01:03:58,918 --> 01:04:00,836
What do you say?

627
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:05,257
Will you let me help you?

628
01:04:14,725 --> 01:04:16,476
- What happened?
- You spilled it.

629
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:20,355
Try to get to the door.
Follow the wall with your hand...

630
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:26,111
And after the glass cabinet...

631
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:53,305
Well, I have my ups and downs.

632
01:04:53,472 --> 01:04:55,724
But I slept very well
the last few nights.

633
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:59,144
Iván has been
very patient with me all week.

634
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:01,354
Yes, he takes good care of me.

635
01:05:01,522 --> 01:05:04,649
I will. I will, yes.

636
01:05:04,817 --> 01:05:06,902
Thanks a lot for calling. Bye.

637
01:05:08,696 --> 01:05:12,282
- Are you leaving?
- Yes. It's a little late.

638
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:14,492
Why don't stay a bit longer?

639
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:17,829
A little while.

640
01:05:17,955 --> 01:05:20,248
- Are you still afraid?
- No.

641
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:22,167
No, it's not that.

642
01:05:23,044 --> 01:05:24,794
Never mind.

643
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:29,382
OK, should I make
a special dinner for two?

644
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:34,596
- Go and watch TV. I'll cook.
- That's a little difficult.

645
01:05:57,244 --> 01:05:59,287
Aren't you drinking too much?

646
01:05:59,914 --> 01:06:02,040
I'm celebrating.

647
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:03,708
What?

648
01:06:03,876 --> 01:06:07,545
That in four days,

649
01:06:07,713 --> 01:06:10,966
I will have the bandages removed
and I will see again.

650
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:14,719
Everything will be all right, Julia.

651
01:06:16,055 --> 01:06:18,139
You know,

652
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:22,477
if the operation doesn't work,
I couldn't complain.

653
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:26,231
I have seen everything I wanted to see.

654
01:06:27,733 --> 01:06:31,069
What's the most beautiful thing
you've ever seen?

655
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:34,197
Funny!

656
01:06:34,323 --> 01:06:36,783
How ironic that you ask me that.

657
01:06:36,951 --> 01:06:38,618
Why?

658
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:45,125
Because I spent my whole life
looking for invisible planets.

659
01:06:45,292 --> 01:06:48,503
My eyes have seen amazing things.

660
01:06:49,213 --> 01:06:55,260
But nothing can compare
to the sky in the Sahara.

661
01:06:58,014 --> 01:07:00,765
That's where I met Isaac.

662
01:07:00,933 --> 01:07:06,187
We were on the same excursion
and we spent the whole night...

663
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:09,858
...staring at the sky.

664
01:07:10,818 --> 01:07:15,238
I asked him, "Is that not the most
beautiful thing you've ever seen?"

665
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:18,408
And he said, "Yes. "

666
01:07:24,165 --> 01:07:26,458
When I turned my head,

667
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:31,212
I realised that he'd been watching me
for a while and I got nervous.

668
01:07:32,339 --> 01:07:34,299
And I asked him...

669
01:07:36,969 --> 01:07:39,971
..."Why aren't you watching
the universe?"

670
01:07:40,639 --> 01:07:45,769
And he said,
"I don't have to look up to do it. "

671
01:07:47,104 --> 01:07:50,440
"I can see the universe in your eyes. "

672
01:07:52,651 --> 01:07:54,569
And what happened?

673
01:07:57,364 --> 01:07:59,282
I came close.

674
01:08:00,534 --> 01:08:02,160
I touched him.

675
01:08:03,162 --> 01:08:06,456
And I realised that he was nervous too.

676
01:08:06,999 --> 01:08:11,211
In that moment it was as if
we became one person.

677
01:08:11,378 --> 01:08:14,255
And I wanted to know
if he felt the same.

678
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:16,674
What did he say?

679
01:08:17,718 --> 01:08:19,385
Nothing.

680
01:08:21,055 --> 01:08:23,598
He replied with his gaze.

681
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:25,391
Why?

682
01:08:25,559 --> 01:08:29,229
Why did he look at me that way? Why?

683
01:08:30,689 --> 01:08:34,692
- Do you prefer I hadn't done it?
- I don't know.

684
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:40,865
When you had the affair with Sara,
I thought it was just an indiscretion,

685
01:08:41,033 --> 01:08:44,327
but I swear I don't know
what to think any more.

686
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:47,413
I don't know what to think.

687
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:53,545
Everything will be all right, Julia.

688
01:08:55,673 --> 01:08:57,549
You promise?

689
01:08:59,218 --> 01:09:01,219
I promise.

690
01:09:19,405 --> 01:09:21,030
No, I can't.

691
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:23,283
I can't do it.

692
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:25,910
It's not right.

693
01:09:32,126 --> 01:09:34,085
- Iván.
- Don't say anything.

694
01:09:34,295 --> 01:09:37,714
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be. Don't say anything.

695
01:09:37,882 --> 01:09:40,258
I'll call the hospital
and ask to be replaced.

696
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:42,177
Is that what you want?

697
01:09:43,888 --> 01:09:45,597
And you?

698
01:09:53,355 --> 01:09:56,524
OK, I'll come back tomorrow and...

699
01:09:57,401 --> 01:10:00,361
If not, just contact me on my pager.

700
01:11:30,869 --> 01:11:33,371
Help! Help!

701
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:37,166
Help!

702
01:11:38,877 --> 01:11:43,047
Calm down!
I'm Blasco, the neighbour! Lía's father!

703
01:11:43,215 --> 01:11:45,675
Call the police, please!

704
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:49,429
Calm down!
You need a drink.

705
01:11:49,596 --> 01:11:53,266
No, no.
Call the police, please.

706
01:11:53,392 --> 01:11:57,478
Why do you want to call the police?
To tell another one of your nightmares?

707
01:11:57,646 --> 01:12:01,774
- The last time they didn't believe you.
- No. There was someone by my bed.

708
01:12:01,942 --> 01:12:03,776
I swear, this time it's true.

709
01:12:03,902 --> 01:12:06,738
And what did he want?
To rape you?

710
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:10,366
It's my daughter.
Don't be afraid.

711
01:12:10,534 --> 01:12:12,702
I told you not to sneak up on people!

712
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:14,912
Go back to your bed!

713
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:17,749
And close the door!

714
01:12:17,958 --> 01:12:20,084
Mr Blasco...

715
01:12:21,253 --> 01:12:23,421
Can you call now, please?

716
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:30,303
Of course, of course.
Don't worry.

717
01:12:32,514 --> 01:12:35,433
How strange.
There's no line.

718
01:12:37,978 --> 01:12:39,937
Calm down.

719
01:12:40,105 --> 01:12:42,231
I'll get the mobile phone.

720
01:13:18,519 --> 01:13:23,815
The mobile is out of battery.
It will take a few minutes to charge.

721
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:30,071
Sit down, sit down.

722
01:13:30,489 --> 01:13:32,448
Sit down.

723
01:13:33,325 --> 01:13:34,534
What do you say?

724
01:13:34,701 --> 01:13:40,540
Do you want something to drink
while we wait?

725
01:13:41,291 --> 01:13:44,627
- What do you say?
- Could I have a glass of water?

726
01:13:44,795 --> 01:13:49,757
- Water?
- Yes, my throat is a bit dry.

727
01:14:06,984 --> 01:14:10,153
Julia, where are you going?

728
01:14:11,029 --> 01:14:14,949
Hey!

729
01:14:15,409 --> 01:14:18,828
Madam!
Where are you, madam?

730
01:14:19,079 --> 01:14:20,830
Madam!

731
01:14:22,166 --> 01:14:24,709
Please, pick up.

732
01:14:25,502 --> 01:14:27,170
Iván.

733
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:29,255
Pick up, please.

734
01:14:29,423 --> 01:14:30,465
Julia, what's wrong?

735
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:45,813
- Julia!
- Iván!

736
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:49,358
- Let's go to your house.
- Not my house.

737
01:14:49,568 --> 01:14:51,861
- Julia, calm down.
- No, my house is not safe.

738
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:54,697
Please. Take me to your place.

739
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:58,117
OK.

740
01:14:58,243 --> 01:15:01,537
OK, thanks. Bye.

741
01:15:03,790 --> 01:15:05,583
What did they say?

742
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:09,879
Inspector Dimas
won't be on duty until seven.

743
01:15:11,006 --> 01:15:15,593
You should get some rest
and I'll go with you tomorrow morning.

744
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:19,680
Julia, I won't let anyone hurt you.

745
01:15:21,433 --> 01:15:22,850
You can sleep in my bed.

746
01:15:23,018 --> 01:15:25,811
- And you?
- I have a mattress. I'll be right back.

747
01:15:25,938 --> 01:15:30,274
- No, no.
- I'll be right back. You're safe here.

748
01:15:30,442 --> 01:15:32,151
I'll be back in a minute.

749
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,585
Iván?

750
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:32,169
- Who are you?
- I'm Lía.

751
01:16:32,337 --> 01:16:33,921
- Who are you?
- Lía Blasco.

752
01:16:34,089 --> 01:16:35,965
Don't get close.
How did you find me?

753
01:16:36,133 --> 01:16:39,427
- I followed you. I was Sara's friend.
- I said don't come close.

754
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:43,347
Listen, my father
has nothing to do with all this.

755
01:16:43,515 --> 01:16:47,435
- Your father lied to me.
- My father is lonely, and you're hot.

756
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:48,853
I don't believe you.

757
01:16:49,021 --> 01:16:52,607
I was the one who took the key
and have been spying on you.

758
01:16:52,774 --> 01:16:54,650
- You?
- Do you have nightmares?

759
01:16:54,818 --> 01:16:57,612
- What?
- Sara also had them.

760
01:16:57,779 --> 01:17:02,408
She dreamt of someone taking the bandage
off and piercing her eyes with needles.

761
01:17:02,576 --> 01:17:04,035
There's a monster on the street,

762
01:17:04,202 --> 01:17:06,787
but no one can see him
because he hides in the darkness.

763
01:17:06,955 --> 01:17:09,165
He made Sara go blind
and will do the same with you.

764
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:10,875
- Stop!
- It's him.

765
01:17:11,043 --> 01:17:14,712
I followed him and tried the key.
And today I saw the needles again.

766
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:18,049
- It's him, Julia. It's the care worker.
- No.

767
01:17:19,551 --> 01:17:21,927
Listen to me!

768
01:17:23,347 --> 01:17:26,515
Do you really think Isaac
killed himself? He loved you.

769
01:17:26,683 --> 01:17:31,062
- He loved Sara more.
- They didn't want to worry you.

770
01:17:31,229 --> 01:17:33,856
That's why they kept you in the dark.
Sara told me.

771
01:17:34,024 --> 01:17:36,567
Isaac wrote a suicide note.
Leave me alone.

772
01:17:36,693 --> 01:17:40,655
- The monster forced him to write it.
- Monsters don't exist. Enough!

773
01:17:40,822 --> 01:17:42,615
This one does.

774
01:17:44,242 --> 01:17:46,410
He collects pictures.

775
01:17:46,828 --> 01:17:50,998
His wall is covered
with pictures of you and Sara.

776
01:17:51,708 --> 01:17:55,336
- He removed your eyes.
- Lía, that's enough!

777
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:56,921
Leave me alone!

778
01:17:59,216 --> 01:18:00,758
What are you doing?

779
01:18:03,637 --> 01:18:06,013
Use the key if you don't believe me.

780
01:18:07,766 --> 01:18:10,226
The key. Where's the key?

781
01:18:10,394 --> 01:18:12,561
- He took it.
- No, you took it.

782
01:18:12,729 --> 01:18:16,524
- Why me?
- I don't know. To protect your father.

783
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:20,236
- It's him. Don't tell him I'm here.
- Lía. Lía.

784
01:18:24,199 --> 01:18:25,449
Iván?

785
01:18:25,575 --> 01:18:28,202
Julia, what are you doing?

786
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:30,663
I'm really nervous.

787
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:34,125
I'll make you a cup of tea.

788
01:18:34,292 --> 01:18:36,127
It will help you relax.

789
01:18:36,962 --> 01:18:39,463
- Iván...
- Yes?

790
01:18:40,507 --> 01:18:45,219
I can't find the key. It's the only
evidence to incriminate Blasco.

791
01:18:45,887 --> 01:18:48,139
Did you take it?

792
01:19:00,944 --> 01:19:03,738
- You must have dropped it.
- Please, give it to me.

793
01:19:03,905 --> 01:19:06,115
I'll keep it for you.
You are very nervous.

794
01:19:06,283 --> 01:19:09,869
I'll make you a cup of tea.
You sit down and relax.

795
01:19:18,670 --> 01:19:21,422
He's lying. He had the key.

796
01:19:21,548 --> 01:19:24,091
- We have to get out of here.
- I don't want to.

797
01:19:24,259 --> 01:19:27,845
- You don't believe me now?
- It's impossible. He is a care worker.

798
01:19:30,474 --> 01:19:33,225
Shit! It's locked.

799
01:19:34,561 --> 01:19:36,437
- Julia!
- Yes?

800
01:19:37,564 --> 01:19:40,274
- Do you want sugar?
- Two teaspoons, thanks.

801
01:19:44,404 --> 01:19:46,530
He wants to drug you and make you blind.

802
01:19:46,698 --> 01:19:47,823
What are you saying?

803
01:19:47,991 --> 01:19:50,326
- Can you take this off?
- No. Why?

804
01:19:50,494 --> 01:19:55,039
Then we can't get out of the window.
I need to get the key.

805
01:19:55,207 --> 01:19:58,417
Get rid of him
and wait for me in the bathroom.

806
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:02,880
Here you go.

807
01:20:03,715 --> 01:20:07,384
I'll take you to bed
and wait until you fall asleep.

808
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:15,017
I need to go to the bathroom.

809
01:20:16,603 --> 01:20:18,145
OK.

810
01:20:22,359 --> 01:20:23,651
Thank you.

811
01:21:01,022 --> 01:21:04,692
- Julia, is everything all right?
- Yes. What was that noise?

812
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:06,944
I don't know. I heard it too.

813
01:21:07,112 --> 01:21:09,530
I thought something had happened to you.

814
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:13,701
- Hurry up, or your tea will get cold.
- I'll be right out.

815
01:21:18,373 --> 01:21:21,667
Lía, please.

816
01:21:24,170 --> 01:21:26,630
Four days left. Only four days.

817
01:21:28,884 --> 01:21:31,302
Four days, four days.

818
01:21:45,650 --> 01:21:48,485
Julia, I have to go down again.
Are you OK?

819
01:21:48,653 --> 01:21:51,196
Yes, I'll be right out.

820
01:23:11,778 --> 01:23:16,073
Lía.

821
01:23:48,398 --> 01:23:50,607
What are you doing here?

822
01:23:53,653 --> 01:23:55,821
Why are you crying?

823
01:23:58,450 --> 01:24:00,534
Please, answer me.

824
01:24:02,328 --> 01:24:06,248
A girl called Lía came to see me.

825
01:24:06,416 --> 01:24:08,667
Blasco's daughter.

826
01:24:08,835 --> 01:24:10,961
And she made me very nervous.

827
01:24:11,087 --> 01:24:15,049
- Why did you take the bandage off?
- I couldn't see anything.

828
01:24:15,216 --> 01:24:19,762
She told me horrible things about you
and I was afraid.

829
01:24:20,221 --> 01:24:22,056
About me?

830
01:24:22,974 --> 01:24:25,726
You would never hurt me, would you?

831
01:24:26,978 --> 01:24:28,479
No.

832
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:30,981
I had to...

833
01:24:31,149 --> 01:24:34,318
I had to see your face to know it.

834
01:24:35,779 --> 01:24:37,988
And what did you see?

835
01:24:43,661 --> 01:24:46,830
Nothing. I can't see anything.

836
01:25:11,689 --> 01:25:13,482
Are you sure you can't see anything?

837
01:25:23,034 --> 01:25:25,369
Sometimes the eyes
take time to adjust.

838
01:25:38,842 --> 01:25:41,426
The operation didn't work.

839
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:51,395
I'm really sorry, Julia.

840
01:25:55,525 --> 01:25:59,194
Probably the girl lied to you
in order to protect her father.

841
01:26:01,364 --> 01:26:05,242
Tomorrow... we'll speak with
the inspector and all this will be over.

842
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:08,412
No. No.

843
01:26:09,205 --> 01:26:11,707
No, please.
Take me to the hospital now.

844
01:26:11,875 --> 01:26:15,419
- Now, please.
- We'll call Dr Román.

845
01:26:16,004 --> 01:26:19,631
- Now.
- Julia, listen to me.

846
01:26:21,843 --> 01:26:23,594
Dr Román?

847
01:26:23,761 --> 01:26:27,764
It's Iván. Sorry to wake you
at this time of night.

848
01:26:27,891 --> 01:26:30,601
I have a problem with Julia Levin.

849
01:26:32,437 --> 01:26:35,480
She took the bandage off by accident.

850
01:26:43,656 --> 01:26:48,827
I understand. I will tell her right now.
Thanks, and sorry to bother you.

851
01:26:50,288 --> 01:26:51,288
What did he say?

852
01:26:51,497 --> 01:26:54,416
He's at a conference.
We can't do anything until next week.

853
01:26:54,584 --> 01:26:58,795
- Then take me to a different hospital.
- No. Román said you have to rest.

854
01:26:58,963 --> 01:27:04,343
- I need a second opinion.
- Julia, the damage is done.

855
01:27:04,552 --> 01:27:07,512
But if you don't do as I say,
it will be irreversible.

856
01:27:15,980 --> 01:27:17,314
OK.

857
01:27:50,056 --> 01:27:51,765
Why did you get up?

858
01:27:51,933 --> 01:27:56,812
- The kettle was whistling.
- I'll do it. You sit down.

859
01:27:57,605 --> 01:27:59,231
Be careful.

860
01:28:01,901 --> 01:28:03,527
Very good.

861
01:28:14,622 --> 01:28:16,039
This is nearly ready.

862
01:28:32,515 --> 01:28:34,391
Here you are.

863
01:28:35,184 --> 01:28:36,768
Thank you.

864
01:28:53,578 --> 01:28:54,995
What's the matter?

865
01:29:00,376 --> 01:29:02,210
Why are you doing all this, Iván?

866
01:29:09,218 --> 01:29:10,886
What do you mean?

867
01:29:11,054 --> 01:29:13,472
Why all this attention?

868
01:29:16,809 --> 01:29:18,643
What do you want from me?

869
01:29:20,605 --> 01:29:22,731
Well, Julia...

870
01:29:26,611 --> 01:29:28,570
When...

871
01:29:29,405 --> 01:29:30,906
When you kissed me...

872
01:29:33,910 --> 01:29:36,620
I didn't expect it.

873
01:29:36,788 --> 01:29:41,583
I didn't expect it, but don't think
I don't like you because...

874
01:29:41,751 --> 01:29:43,043
because that's not true.

875
01:29:46,005 --> 01:29:49,883
I only wanted to give you some time.
You've suffered a lot.

876
01:29:50,051 --> 01:29:53,929
And some wounds need to heal.

877
01:29:55,890 --> 01:29:58,392
What I'm trying to say is...

878
01:29:59,977 --> 01:30:02,062
...I want to be with you.

879
01:30:07,652 --> 01:30:09,569
Drink your tea.

880
01:30:26,712 --> 01:30:28,505
Did you put sugar in it?

881
01:30:32,844 --> 01:30:34,886
I'll bring some.

882
01:31:02,665 --> 01:31:04,332
Two teaspoons, right?

883
01:31:05,543 --> 01:31:07,043
As usual.

884
01:31:14,427 --> 01:31:15,510
Done?

885
01:31:30,276 --> 01:31:32,360
Can you come with me, please?

886
01:31:35,781 --> 01:31:39,201
- Why?
- I need your help with the freezer.

887
01:31:40,161 --> 01:31:43,747
Come. Let's go. Leave this here.

888
01:32:09,690 --> 01:32:11,441
Open the freezer.

889
01:32:11,651 --> 01:32:13,193
Why?

890
01:32:13,402 --> 01:32:15,445
Just do it.

891
01:32:17,657 --> 01:32:20,283
Open the freezer, I said.

892
01:32:50,648 --> 01:32:52,357
Liar.

893
01:33:14,463 --> 01:33:16,464
Are you afraid?

894
01:33:26,726 --> 01:33:31,021
You don't know what fear is!

895
01:33:33,316 --> 01:33:37,360
You have no idea what fear is!

896
01:33:37,528 --> 01:33:38,820
Real fear.

897
01:33:38,988 --> 01:33:41,281
Fear of being ignored and rejected.

898
01:33:41,449 --> 01:33:44,367
Look at me. Look at me!

899
01:33:44,577 --> 01:33:48,079
You don't know what it's like to live
in the dark and hide in another world.

900
01:33:48,205 --> 01:33:54,294
A world full of silence,
getting used to measuring your steps.

901
01:33:55,046 --> 01:33:58,089
Always wearing
the appropriate clothes.

902
01:33:58,257 --> 01:34:01,509
Making your voice one voice and none.

903
01:34:01,677 --> 01:34:05,388
And your eyes, two eyes and none.

904
01:34:05,556 --> 01:34:09,601
It takes so long that eventually
you become a shadow.

905
01:34:09,810 --> 01:34:14,147
But one day you find out that
blind girls realise that you're there,

906
01:34:14,315 --> 01:34:18,360
that you're breathing,
that you are still alive.

907
01:34:18,527 --> 01:34:24,074
That you can offer them your eyes
for theirs, your hands for theirs...

908
01:34:24,533 --> 01:34:27,535
That's why our relationship
is so perfect.

909
01:34:28,412 --> 01:34:29,496
That's why...

910
01:34:30,706 --> 01:34:32,832
...we have to continue this way.

911
01:34:38,339 --> 01:34:40,882
If you are not Iván, who are you?

912
01:34:41,717 --> 01:34:43,718
Where are you taking me?

913
01:34:44,762 --> 01:34:47,347
My eyes hurt.
Something is wrong.

914
01:34:47,932 --> 01:34:50,684
Take the bandage off, please.

915
01:34:51,477 --> 01:34:53,269
Please.

916
01:34:54,230 --> 01:34:56,106
Please, take it off.

917
01:34:56,273 --> 01:34:59,567
Please, my eyes hurt.
Take the bandage off.

918
01:34:59,735 --> 01:35:01,611
Shut up!

919
01:35:03,948 --> 01:35:05,782
I beg you.

920
01:35:20,673 --> 01:35:25,468
Let me see.

921
01:35:29,014 --> 01:35:31,975
It's started again, right?

922
01:35:38,274 --> 01:35:40,275
This time...

923
01:35:41,068 --> 01:35:43,486
...it will be more intense.

924
01:35:58,294 --> 01:36:01,337
Get out of the car.
You have to pack your bags.

925
01:36:03,466 --> 01:36:04,841
Open the door, Julia.

926
01:36:09,847 --> 01:36:13,808
Open the fucking door!
Open the door!

927
01:36:14,643 --> 01:36:16,936
Open the fucking door!

928
01:36:17,354 --> 01:36:18,893
Julia!

929
01:37:46,277 --> 01:37:48,444
Who's there?

930
01:37:48,612 --> 01:37:50,947
Is the main door locked?

931
01:37:51,115 --> 01:37:54,117
- Is that you, Julia? You scared me.
- Is it locked?

932
01:37:54,285 --> 01:37:56,995
Yes, of course.
What's wrong?

933
01:37:57,204 --> 01:37:59,873
- There's a murderer in the area.
- A murderer?

934
01:37:59,999 --> 01:38:02,292
We have to call the police.
Where's the phone?

935
01:38:02,459 --> 01:38:06,796
There, in the corner.
Under the painting.

936
01:38:06,964 --> 01:38:08,923
Don't move.

937
01:38:09,091 --> 01:38:10,925
Be quiet.

938
01:38:11,427 --> 01:38:13,177
- What's wrong?
- Don't move.

939
01:38:20,227 --> 01:38:23,146
- It's him. He's here.
- Who?

940
01:38:23,814 --> 01:38:26,316
Don't come any closer,
you son of a bitch.

941
01:38:26,483 --> 01:38:30,194
- Who are you talking to?
- To a man who thinks he's invisible.

942
01:38:30,362 --> 01:38:33,489
He made Sara go blind
and he wants to do the same to me.

943
01:38:33,991 --> 01:38:37,285
- You're scaring me.
- Stay away.

944
01:38:37,453 --> 01:38:39,412
Soledad, call the police.

945
01:38:39,622 --> 01:38:42,498
- Call the police, quick!
- Don't do it, Mum.

946
01:38:44,001 --> 01:38:45,710
Ángel...

947
01:38:46,462 --> 01:38:48,296
Is that you, son?

948
01:38:51,467 --> 01:38:53,009
Yes.

949
01:38:53,177 --> 01:38:54,761
I'm back home.

950
01:38:55,512 --> 01:38:58,264
This woman says you're chasing her.

951
01:38:58,432 --> 01:39:00,350
This woman is crazy.

952
01:39:02,603 --> 01:39:05,772
- Your son is a murderer.
- Shut up. Don't listen to her, Mum.

953
01:39:05,940 --> 01:39:07,690
- He killed my husband.
- She's lying.

954
01:39:07,858 --> 01:39:10,610
- He killed my husband and Sara too.
- Shut up.

955
01:39:10,778 --> 01:39:14,614
- It must have been easy to hang her.
- I loved Sara.

956
01:39:15,407 --> 01:39:18,409
She killed herself because she wasn't
capable of living in darkness.

957
01:39:18,619 --> 01:39:20,411
Capable?

958
01:39:20,537 --> 01:39:24,540
No one is capable of getting used to it.
You made her go blind.

959
01:39:24,708 --> 01:39:25,875
You killed her.

960
01:39:26,043 --> 01:39:30,380
- Is that true, son?
- Mum, mum. You know me.

961
01:39:30,547 --> 01:39:33,424
I said don't move.

962
01:39:33,550 --> 01:39:36,844
Make the call. Make it.

963
01:40:03,497 --> 01:40:05,915
I knew you'd come back.

964
01:40:07,418 --> 01:40:11,587
I knew you'd realise
that you can only be happy here.

965
01:40:12,131 --> 01:40:15,258
I told you that without me,
you'd be nothing.

966
01:40:15,426 --> 01:40:17,760
Less than nothing.

967
01:40:17,928 --> 01:40:20,013
Invisible.

968
01:40:27,604 --> 01:40:29,313
Since when can you see, Mum?

969
01:40:29,523 --> 01:40:34,610
But you're still my son, and I won't let
anybody take you away from me.

970
01:40:34,778 --> 01:40:37,697
Mum, I asked you a question.

971
01:40:38,991 --> 01:40:42,702
Since when can you see?

972
01:40:42,870 --> 01:40:46,456
Ángel, what are you doing, son?

973
01:40:46,790 --> 01:40:50,501
What are you doing, son? No, no.

974
01:40:51,086 --> 01:40:53,379
No, no.

975
01:40:54,631 --> 01:40:55,923
Calm down, Mum.

976
01:41:00,095 --> 01:41:02,138
- It's me.
- Mum, calm down.

977
01:41:03,057 --> 01:41:09,312
Look, Mum, this liquid attacks the optic
nerve without causing any pain.

978
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:14,400
Don't worry.
And these needles are very useful too.

979
01:41:14,568 --> 01:41:18,654
- Don't do it, please.
- Mum, I have to do it.

980
01:41:19,156 --> 01:41:21,657
- Oh, my boy!
- Don't worry.

981
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:54,857
What are we doing here?

982
01:41:58,320 --> 01:42:00,571
I won't use it on you.

983
01:42:05,619 --> 01:42:10,623
Your optic nerve must be very damaged
by now. It won't take long.

984
01:42:10,791 --> 01:42:16,379
- This can't end like this.
- Don't worry. Don't worry.

985
01:42:16,547 --> 01:42:22,593
Don't worry. When the darkness comes,
I'll be by your side.

986
01:42:23,554 --> 01:42:25,805
I've packed your bags.

987
01:42:26,014 --> 01:42:30,309
We will go far away
and nobody will find us.

988
01:42:31,145 --> 01:42:32,728
We will start from scratch.

989
01:42:32,896 --> 01:42:34,480
Don't touch me!

990
01:42:35,357 --> 01:42:37,233
Don't touch me, son of a bitch.

991
01:42:38,569 --> 01:42:41,028
I will never love you. Never.

992
01:42:41,196 --> 01:42:42,905
I would die first.

993
01:42:44,032 --> 01:42:45,741
- Don't touch me!
- Is that what you want?

994
01:42:45,909 --> 01:42:48,828
Don't touch me!

995
01:42:49,913 --> 01:42:52,415
Let go of me!

996
01:42:52,583 --> 01:42:55,918
- Let go of me!
- Come on, do it!

997
01:42:58,422 --> 01:43:00,256
Stay with me.

998
01:43:31,788 --> 01:43:34,624
Do it. Do it.

999
01:43:35,209 --> 01:43:37,960
Do it! Do it!

1000
01:43:38,128 --> 01:43:41,130
- Do it.
- I can't! I can't!

1001
01:43:46,428 --> 01:43:47,845
Of course you can't.

1002
01:43:48,013 --> 01:43:51,641
Although you don't know it...
you love me.

1003
01:43:52,226 --> 01:43:55,937
Because you know that without me,
you are nothing.

1004
01:43:56,104 --> 01:43:58,606
And I am only a shadow without you.

1005
01:45:13,974 --> 01:45:16,517
Julia, why did you lock the door?

1006
01:45:20,689 --> 01:45:22,606
- Hello?
- Inspector. It's Julia.

1007
01:45:22,816 --> 01:45:23,858
Julia, it's you.

1008
01:45:24,026 --> 01:45:27,737
Listen to me, because this is
the last time I'll call you.

1009
01:45:27,904 --> 01:45:31,574
- Calm down.
- He's locked me in my house.

1010
01:45:31,742 --> 01:45:33,909
- Calm down, Julia.
- He's going to kill me.

1011
01:45:34,077 --> 01:45:38,497
If you don't come, it will be too late.
You have to believe me. Please.

1012
01:45:38,623 --> 01:45:41,083
- Julia, please, calm down.
- Are you listening to me?

1013
01:45:43,211 --> 01:45:44,670
Inspector?

1014
01:45:51,595 --> 01:45:52,970
Julia!

1015
01:47:58,054 --> 01:48:01,056
Julia, police!
Cover the stairs and the hallway.

1016
01:48:01,224 --> 01:48:03,058
Julia, are you there?

1017
01:48:03,226 --> 01:48:06,061
It's Dimas. Can you hear me?

1018
01:48:06,730 --> 01:48:08,772
- Julia, what are you doing?
- Shut up!

1019
01:48:08,982 --> 01:48:11,901
- What's going on?
- I said shut up!

1020
01:48:22,913 --> 01:48:25,414
Can you see him?
Can you see him, Inspector?

1021
01:48:25,582 --> 01:48:29,251
Police! Put the knife down!
Put your hands above your head!

1022
01:48:43,016 --> 01:48:45,100
Don't look at me.

1023
01:48:47,771 --> 01:48:50,940
Don't look at me, please.

1024
01:48:52,776 --> 01:48:56,529
- Don't look at me!
- Put the knife down!

1025
01:48:59,282 --> 01:49:01,075
Put it down!

1026
01:49:01,785 --> 01:49:05,287
What are you doing?
Put the knife down!

1027
01:49:46,746 --> 01:49:48,998
I will go blind, won't I?

1028
01:49:54,254 --> 01:49:56,338
How long do I have?

1029
01:49:58,300 --> 01:50:00,634
You'll go blind before dawn.

1030
01:50:09,227 --> 01:50:11,729
I need you to do me a favour.

1031
01:50:44,054 --> 01:50:45,888
Can we have a moment?

1032
01:50:55,732 --> 01:50:57,274
What happened to his eyes?

1033
01:50:59,819 --> 01:51:01,904
He donated them.

1034
01:51:08,411 --> 01:51:09,953
And where are they?

1035
01:51:10,705 --> 01:51:12,998
Where he would have wanted.

1036
01:51:21,591 --> 01:51:24,134
Isaac, why?

1037
01:51:25,970 --> 01:51:29,264
My God, I miss you so much.

1038
01:51:34,187 --> 01:51:40,067
You promised me.

1039
01:52:23,236 --> 01:52:26,822
You told me
that when you looked into my eyes...

1040
01:52:27,657 --> 01:52:29,783
...you could see the entire universe.

1041
01:52:30,827 --> 01:52:32,828
I still can.

1042
01:53:28,760 --> 01:53:30,469
JULIA'S EYES
