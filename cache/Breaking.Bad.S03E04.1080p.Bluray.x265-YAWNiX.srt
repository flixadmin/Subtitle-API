1
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:47,422
80 cigarettes and gas is $79.70.

2
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:50,884
Crap.

3
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,095
There's an atm right outside.

4
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:56,682
Yeah, I don't have a card.

5
00:00:57,266 --> 00:01:00,769
Well, you can write a personal check
with ID.

6
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:04,690
Kind of in between banks right now.

7
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:08,610
You think I could just
come back later?

8
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:11,822
I'm totally good for it.
I'd come back, I swear.

9
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,953
If it were me, I'd be totally,
you know, "no problem."

10
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,998
But my dad is
this ginormous hard-ass.

11
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,584
He was in fallujah for a year.

12
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,296
And he always checks the receipts.
I mean, like, always.

13
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:29,590
I gotta call him. I'm sorry.

14
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,133
Wait, wait, wait.

15
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,511
Hold on a second.

16
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,973
Maybe we could...

17
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:40,642
Trade.

18
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:48,150
Ever try it?

19
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:53,113
I mean, I smoke pot a lot sometimes.

20
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:55,157
I party.

21
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:59,870
- But that stuff's really addictive, right?
- Not really.

22
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:03,498
It's just a media thing. You know?

23
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,463
What's it like?

24
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,053
It's awesome.

25
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:23,018
Everything's maximum interesting.

26
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:30,400
You get these really cold
and sharp-like action dagger feelings.

27
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,864
It's awesome.

28
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:40,494
Come on. What do you say?

29
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,237
Have a nice day.

30
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,611
So how does it feel?

31
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:58,405
Does it hurt?

32
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,949
Yeah, it's tight.

33
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:04,453
- Yeah, but is it painful?
- It's hard to breathe.

34
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:07,956
Well, you need your breathing.

35
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,835
Although let's not lose sight
of the fact...

36
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:15,464
That you were the victim
of a terrible accident, Antonio...

37
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,175
So some discomfort is
to be expected.

38
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:26,683
Let's go with that one.

39
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:33,148
A cashier's check, por favor.

40
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:37,360
Oh, and spread the word.
I'm building a class-action, flight 515.

41
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,154
Victims' families would be great.

42
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:41,990
I'll take anyone on the ground
who suffered emotionally.

43
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:45,368
Anxiety, sleeplessness.
You get the picture.

44
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,953
Trouble?

45
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,499
Ted beneke? You cannot be serious.

46
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:54,002
- That guy is a joke.
- You know what? You called my bluff.

47
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:55,462
What does that even mean?

48
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,799
You dared me to tell the police
and I couldn't do it, so you win.

49
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:02,385
If you want to stay in this house, fine,
but we are not married anymore.

50
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:05,972
I told you that
I was done cooking meth, Skyler.

51
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,682
- I promised you that.
- So what?

52
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:10,352
You know what?
At least I didn't run off to go...

53
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,814
Jesus! I mean, everything that I did,
I did for this family.

54
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,067
- Just keep telling yourself that.
- What is that supposed to mean?

55
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:18,985
You don't like it, then leave.

56
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,489
- And take your drug money with you.
- That's what you want.

57
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:27,828
- Jesus.
- Garbage disposal.

58
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,830
You think this will get me
to move out?

59
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,749
You can screw Ted. You can screw
the butcher, the mailman.

60
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,376
- God, Walt.
- Whoever you want.

61
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:37,254
Screw them all.
I'm not going anywhere.

62
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,214
Suit yourself.

63
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:42,008
Is this a good or bad thing?

64
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,720
Suit myself.
You want me to suit myself?

65
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,722
I'll suit myself to his face!

66
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:50,058
It's a bad thing.

67
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,407
Walter white to see Ted beneke.

68
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:09,578
I'm sorry.
Mr. Beneke's on a conference call.

69
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:13,582
Okay. I will wait.

70
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,709
It could be a while.

71
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:18,879
I have all the time in the world.

72
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:45,530
Okay.

73
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,284
- Here we go. Okay.
- Excuse me.

74
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:51,620
- Mr. Beneke's not available.
- Ted? Come on.

75
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,538
Sir, excuse me.

76
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,124
Excuse me.

77
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,959
Ted, I can see you.

78
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,629
I can see you standing right there
in your office.

79
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:01,838
Now, come on.

80
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:06,927
Open the door. Come on, let's talk.
I just want to talk. That's all.

81
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,679
Come on, let's be men about this.
Okay? How about that?

82
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,351
Hey, Walt. I'm kind of in the middle
of something now.

83
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,269
Oh, yes, you are.

84
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:18,146
80 open the door.

85
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:20,649
You're damn right.
You're right in the middle.

86
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,318
Just open the door
and let's talk about it, okay?

87
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,654
Open the door, Ted, right now.

88
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:30,825
You don't want to be a man about it?
Plan b. How do you like that? Plan b.

89
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:33,828
We have a situation.

90
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:41,503
Walt. Walt. Walt.

91
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,964
What are you doing?

92
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,840
I'm talking with Ted.

93
00:07:57,102 --> 00:08:01,564
Next time, you'll open the door.

94
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:05,402
- Freeze! Come on.
- Oh, damn it.

95
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,987
No, I'm just here to talk.

96
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,406
- I just want to talk to him.
- Outside. Let's go.

97
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:13,201
God. Can I just talk?
I just want to talk to him.

98
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,370
- Calm down.
- I'm just... okay, all right.

99
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:18,832
All right, all right, all right.
I'm calm. I'm calm.

100
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,334
Asshole.

101
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:42,188
What do you want?
What do you want?

102
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,233
Hey! Hey, come on.

103
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:49,112
What the hell is wrong with you?

104
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,740
You act like you're the first guy
this happened to.

105
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:55,577
I caught my second wife screwing
my stepdad, okay?

106
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:59,039
It's a cruel world, Walt. Grow up.

107
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:03,251
- I just wanted to talk to him.
- Yeah, well, now I'm talking to you.

108
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:05,378
Consider this an intervention.

109
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,298
You could have been arrested
back there. You understand.

110
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:11,551
Speaking as your lawyer,
I'm always looking for billable hours.

111
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,928
But speaking as
your business associate...

112
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,931
I'm strongly advising
that you get your shit together.

113
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:22,437
Just cool it with this beneke guy,
at least for now. Okay?

114
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:27,442
Let's talk shop, because
I think this is a great opportunity...

115
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:31,321
To channel some of that negative
energy into something positive.

116
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:34,574
- How did you know?
- Sorry?

117
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,285
About Skyler.
About where to find me just now.

118
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:39,454
How did you know?

119
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:43,500
That's just my meticulousness.
Don't bog down in detail, Walt.

120
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,795
- The lesson here should be...
- Did you bug my house?

121
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,510
Yeah, but I didn't know it was
your house, did I?

122
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:56,304
You'd moved out.
Besides, you basically told me to.

123
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:59,474
- I told you to?
- You strongly hinted that I should.

124
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:03,686
You were worried your wife might say
something to the police.

125
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:08,483
What? No, no, that's not true.
When the hell did I say that?

126
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,277
Let's not get lost in the who,
what and whens.

127
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:15,657
The point is we did our due diligence
and she didn't talk.

128
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,867
She kept quiet.
She stood by you, Walt...

129
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:21,996
Which, if you ask me,
is the ironical silver lining here.

130
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,998
I mean, on the one hand...

131
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:29,003
Sure, she snuck off the reservation
to get some dirty, damp and deep.

132
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,463
On the other hand...

133
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,523
You're fired!

134
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,150
- You're done!
- Good!

135
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,068
"Oh, boohoo,
I won't cook meth anymore."

136
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:54,154
You're a crybaby. Who needs you?

137
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,031
I'm unplugging the website,
so no more money laundering.

138
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,199
How do you like that?

139
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:01,077
I want those bugs
out of my house today.

140
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:03,538
I want them out now!

141
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:07,500
You just bought a $300 suit, psycho!

142
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,887
Great, drilled right into the stucco.

143
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,225
A little bit of putty, you'll be fine.

144
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:28,438
Just make sure
you get all of those things.

145
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:32,942
A, these things cost $800 apiece.

146
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,694
B, you're not that interesting.

147
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:37,906
So yeah, I'll get all of them, Walter.

148
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:43,578
Great line of work, by the way.
Real upstanding field.

149
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,622
Yeah, well...

150
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,375
I enjoy it.

151
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:01,429
You're free to leave now. Anytime.

152
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,767
You know, Walter...

153
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:10,271
Sometimes it doesn't hurt
to have someone watching your back.

154
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,935
Mr. White?

155
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,654
What's up?

156
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:49,579
I can't begin to understand
what you're going through, Walt...

157
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:54,751
With all of your health concerns
and the stresses you've been under.

158
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,544
But still, as educators...

159
00:13:56,711 --> 00:14:00,757
There are certain responsibilities
we need to be meeting here...

160
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,718
To the school
and to the students themselves.

161
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:05,470
Of course.

162
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:10,266
Is this a wheaten terrier?

163
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,895
Norfolk.

164
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:15,897
Norfolk?

165
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,566
That's surprising.

166
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,404
Walt, could you come back over here
and have a seat, please?

167
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,740
Sure.

168
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:40,088
You've been absent a lot recently.

169
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:45,385
And when you are here at school, there
have been some behavioral questions.

170
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,054
And frankly I'm concerned.

171
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,558
Thank you.

172
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,236
Are you feeling okay?

173
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:07,448
Do you think maybe
I should call Skyler?

174
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:21,003
Let's just keep this...

175
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,839
What...?

176
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:30,096
Walt, what's wrong with you?

177
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:15,516
You know, look, you're the one
always talking about D.C., okay?

178
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,351
This is how you get there.

179
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:20,521
You answer the bell.
You pay your dues.

180
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:28,196
Besides, you know,
it's a big deal to get picked for this.

181
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:33,367
El Paso's like the super bowl.

182
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:37,705
I could get killed crossing the street,
okay?

183
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:41,125
Whatever. You know, I want to go.

184
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:43,544
What about last time?

185
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:45,755
What about last time?

186
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:10,446
Schrader.

187
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:13,533
Hey, sheriff. Yeah.

188
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:17,036
Blue, huh?

189
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:22,291
Yeah, yeah. Thing is...

190
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:26,087
Thing is I'm supposed to be getting
on a plane right now.

191
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:34,095
The stuff this guy had was blue.
You sure about that?

192
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:41,769
Yeah, I want to talk to him.

193
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,440
Taxi.

194
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,773
- Hi.
- Man, I'm sorry.

195
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,277
I needed to talk to you,
but you weren't at your apartment.

196
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,821
No, I moved back home.

197
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:35,990
That's good, right?

198
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:41,495
- Yo, did you just get fired?
- No.

199
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,165
No, no, no.

200
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,751
It's more like a sabbatical.

201
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,837
Indefinite. Yeah.

202
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:07,021
So, what's up?

203
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:09,690
Should we go somewhere?

204
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:13,069
No, this is fine.

205
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:18,991
So I want an intro to your guy.

206
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,576
What guy?

207
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:25,164
Your guy. Your distribution guy.
The guy Saul hooked you up with.

208
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,500
No, no, no. Come on, Jesse.

209
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:32,213
- I thought about it and I want to.
- God.

210
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,173
It's the one thing I'm good at.

211
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,051
No, that is just not true.

212
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:39,762
You're good at a lot of things, son.

213
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,347
Like what?

214
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,435
What about your sobriety?

215
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:49,689
I told you, I'm not using.

216
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:51,732
Ever.

217
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:55,611
I just want back into the business.

218
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:03,119
Well, I don't. I'm sorry.

219
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,454
I know, and that's cool.

220
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:09,250
I'm not asking you to cook.

221
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,254
What's this?

222
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:18,259
In the end, I just went with
two reflux condensers.

223
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:20,928
I didn't want to lose track
of my ph levels.

224
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:25,099
But I did everything else
just like you taught me.

225
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:28,769
Super careful in my amounts...

226
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:32,440
And watched the numbers
every step of the way.

227
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:36,861
So, what do you think?
It's good, right?

228
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:44,785
What in the hell is this?

229
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:47,163
- What?
- What?

230
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:50,833
This. This. This is my product.

231
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,502
This is my formula. This is mine.

232
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:58,007
It's our product,
but yeah, I was gonna cut you in.

233
00:20:58,174 --> 00:20:59,884
Oh, you were gonna cut me in?

234
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:02,470
No, no, no. I cut you in.

235
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:06,474
What the hell is your problem?
All I'm asking is for you to set a meet.

236
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,602
-Absolutely not. —why?

237
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:14,607
Because I am not gonna lend my name
to an inferior product.

238
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:17,151
I mean, look at the diameters here.

239
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:19,111
What did you use for reduction?

240
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,156
Don't tell me. Platinum dioxide, right?

241
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:25,493
No. Mercury-aluminum amalgam.

242
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,828
The dioxide's too hard to keep wet.

243
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,290
All right, well,
you must've done it wrong, then.

244
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:35,294
Your color is all cloudy, so you were
struggling with distillation too.

245
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:38,172
Now, this is very shoddy work,
Pinkman.

246
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:40,341
I'm actually embarrassed for you.

247
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,134
What?

248
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:46,847
No way. I gave out samples
and everyone said it was the bomb.

249
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,476
Oh, they said it was the bomb.

250
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:53,646
And who were they, I wonder?
A bunch of meth heads?

251
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:57,691
- They should know, right?
- Yeah, well, sorry.

252
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:00,194
- I can't help you.
- Fine, ass-wad.

253
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:03,364
- I'll contact the guy myself.
- Oh, yeah? Well, good luck.

254
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:06,867
Because my guy is a pro
and he doesn't deal with junkies.

255
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:09,745
- You know what? Eat me.
- Anytime, loser.

256
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:11,038
Hey, hey, hey!

257
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:14,250
Wait. Hey!

258
00:22:14,274 --> 00:22:22,274
http://hiqve.com/

259
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:56,000
I can't believe it's only 4:00.

260
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:00,421
This day is dragging.

261
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:10,764
Okay.

262
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:39,960
I wish I could stay.

263
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,755
So stay.

264
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:47,676
What's stopping you?

265
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:53,265
What, like everything, you mean?

266
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:57,478
How about my lunatic husband
refusing to leave the house?

267
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:01,941
80 move in here.

268
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:07,821
And then my son hating me
even more.

269
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:11,784
That'll pass.
I went through that with the girls.

270
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:13,369
They adapt.

271
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:18,332
And now everyone at work thinks
I'm an evil ladder-climbing whore.

272
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:21,210
They're all fired,
effective immediately.

273
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:23,003
What else?

274
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,466
Oh, aren't you the answer man?

275
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,681
Where did it...?

276
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:39,812
Where did it go wrong, exactly,
with you and Walt?

277
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:47,486
I mean, I always saw him as kind of...

278
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:52,032
Mild-mannered.

279
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:56,912
Something, I don't know,
change when he got sick or...?

280
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,666
I don't know what changed, Ted.

281
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:05,004
And I just don't feel really comfortable
talking about it.

282
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:07,131
Sorry.

283
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,551
Just asking out of self-interest.

284
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:13,387
Gotta make sure
I don't make the same mistake.

285
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:17,683
I would be amazed.

286
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:23,022
Just let me see if
I'm following you here, Russell.

287
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:27,943
You got this stuff from some guy
at gasparza's...

288
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:29,945
Who was wearing tan pants...

289
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:34,283
And who you're 80 percent sure
had a mustache.

290
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:35,909
That's it, right?

291
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:39,913
That's your brain
working at maximum capacity?

292
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:48,422
Russell.

293
00:25:49,423 --> 00:25:51,759
Everything all right in there?

294
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:56,680
Mel. The dude's name was Mel.

295
00:25:57,097 --> 00:26:01,310
Well, there you go. See?
You served an actual earthly function.

296
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:03,395
I can't believe I remembered that.

297
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:07,608
Mel who?
Does he have a last name?

298
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,985
Yeah, Mel.

299
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:13,072
Wait.

300
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:18,285
Or Mark?

301
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:21,497
It was definitely an m name.

302
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,791
Oh, man, I'm losing it.

303
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:26,460
Wait, wait.

304
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,133
It's gone.

305
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,635
It's gone.

306
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:37,096
- It was an m name though.
- Yeah.

307
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:40,140
I remember the... sound.

308
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:46,146
All right, well,
we'll go with the... sound.

309
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:47,981
- Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.
- Yeah.

310
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,234
He definitely had tan pants.

311
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:55,364
Remind me to get a vasectomy.

312
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:58,283
Okay, it's after 9,
so this bar that girl George is at...

313
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,369
Probably wall-to-wall dirtbags
by now.

314
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:05,999
Let's go have a little iooky-loo,
see if we can't find this m-named clown.

315
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:12,005
What? It's a lead.

316
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:15,008
- Lead to what?
- To Heisenberg.

317
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:18,637
I told you it was only a matter of time
before this guy booted up again.

318
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:20,722
Here we go, my friend.

319
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,975
Don't hate me because I'm beautiful,
gomey.

320
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:26,061
Just apologize and buy me a beer.

321
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,148
Man, you're reaching.

322
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:33,402
This stuff could be a knockoff
or left over from an older cook.

323
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:36,196
How do you know Heisenberg's
gearing up again?

324
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,991
How do I know?

325
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:41,869
Because I know.

326
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,412
I don't get it.

327
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:46,915
This is the reason why
you're blowing off the task force?

328
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:49,001
Chase down teeners?

329
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:52,838
I'm getting tired
of all the second-guessing.

330
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:56,717
If you're not sufficiently stimulated
by this investigation...

331
00:27:56,884 --> 00:27:59,178
Do us both a favor
and ask for a transfer.

332
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,722
What is up with you lately?

333
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:05,601
Starting bar fights,
turning down El Paso...

334
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,186
And now this bullshit?

335
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:10,314
Do you need to talk to someone
or what?

336
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:12,733
Talk to someone?

337
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,194
Talk to who?

338
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:22,576
I'm not trying to step on your toes,
bro. Okay?

339
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:25,412
I'm just worried about you.
That's all.

340
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:28,916
Appreciate that, bro.

341
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:32,336
Now take your hand off my shoulder.

342
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,769
Yeah, yeah, the one that was on TV.

343
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:51,939
Did any little piece
fall on your property?

344
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:55,108
I'm not looking for an entire wing here,
Mr. Linkas.

345
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,320
It could be a nut or a bolt.
It could be a bag of peanuts...

346
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:01,657
Just so long as it caused you
pain and suffering.

347
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:04,409
Oh, no, no, no. Closed.
Calling you back.

348
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:07,829
You had your chance.
I told you to get him cooking again.

349
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:11,917
You blew it off and now it's too late.
The guy's gone mass maniac on us!

350
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:14,419
All I wanted was to show you two
your potential.

351
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,838
And what do I get in return?
A bone contusion.

352
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:20,384
You wanna see the scar?
I wish you two had...

353
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,261
Hi, there.

354
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:27,015
- How in the hell did you get Walt to...?
- I made it.

355
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:30,477
You know the guy
who knows the guy, right?

356
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,345
Well, good news is...

357
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:09,850
For a stage-three cancer,
the guy's doing well physically.

358
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:12,144
Mentally, the guy's a disaster.

359
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:15,856
He's gone off the rails
over this thing with his wife.

360
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:20,986
My opinion, he's not coming back.
Not on his own.

361
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:27,701
Your friends were at his place again,
by the way.

362
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:31,038
They drew something on the street
outside his house.

363
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:35,250
- The scythe.
- Animals.

364
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:37,085
- Does the lawyer know?
- Should he?

365
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:45,052
If you want this guy to produce again,
why not just tell him?

366
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,596
You stand between him
and an ax in the head.

367
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:50,349
I don't believe fear
to be an effective motivator.

368
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,392
I want investment.

369
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:56,229
For now, I'm simply interested
in time frame.

370
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:59,358
He will live for the foreseeable future,
yes?

371
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:05,113
Foreseeable. Couple years at least,
barring acts of god and men with axes.

372
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:08,909
From the lawyer,
I'm supposed to let you know...

373
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:11,787
The Pinkman kid is looking to sell.

374
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:15,582
- I don't work with junkies.
- That's what I thought you'd say.

375
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:17,584
Probably for the best.

376
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:20,087
What I hear,
he and Walter are splitsville.

377
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:23,256
Really?

378
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:26,885
That's what Goodman says.
Cats and dogs.

379
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:31,098
Do the deal.

380
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:01,480
You have one unheard message.

381
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:05,400
Agent schrader, you need
to be calling me back asap.

382
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:09,237
I've got Texas breathing down
my neck and I'm not about...

383
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:34,554
No, I haven't seen Matt since my dad
fired him, like, a while ago.

384
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,598
Where can I find him, you think?

385
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:39,768
- No idea. Haven't seen him.
- I know. You said that a few times.

386
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:44,564
Yeah, because I haven't seen him.
I don't know what else to say.

387
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:51,905
- What's your name, darling?
- Cara.

388
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:00,372
Where did this come from, Cara?

389
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:03,416
I don't know.

390
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,586
What is it? Drugs?

391
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:12,217
Look, I'm just gonna come right out
and say it.

392
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:15,262
You're a bad liar, Cara.

393
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:19,808
Don't get me wrong.
Not the worst I've ever seen.

394
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:24,938
Once had a guy try to explain the dope
balloon up his butt on bad Thai food.

395
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:30,193
Still, you're not a very good liar.

396
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,947
- I honestly don't know...
- Stop.

397
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:37,284
You look like a good kid.
I'm not here to get you in trouble.

398
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:41,329
But you need to tell me
where this came from right now!

399
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:49,462
I never do stuff like this.
I swear to god.

400
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:52,966
I tried it and I hated it,
so I just gave it to Matt.

401
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:55,135
- Okay, and who gave it to you?
- Some guy.

402
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:59,431
He came in a couple days ago
and wanted to trade it for gas.

403
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:02,642
Some guy? What's his name?

404
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:07,105
Okay, what...? What did he look like?

405
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:10,859
I don't know.

406
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:13,028
He looked pretty normal.

407
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:15,655
You know, white.

408
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:22,662
I think his hair was iightish brown.

409
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:25,832
He had really blue eyes.

410
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:28,335
They were really, really blue.

411
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:31,296
Yeah, yeah, yeah, dreamy.
Okay, what else?

412
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:36,384
Piercings, jewelry, distinctive
articles of clothing. Come on.

413
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,012
Come on.

414
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:42,015
Listen to me.

415
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:46,019
It's real important that I find the person
that had these drugs.

416
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:49,522
So if you can remember
anything else...

417
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:55,779
Come on, think.
Come on, now. Come on.

418
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:59,282
He drove an rv.

419
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,493
Okay, good, good.

420
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:03,870
What can you remember?
What kind of rv?

421
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:06,915
What color?
Did you spot a license plate?

422
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:12,712
I don't know the kinds
and I didn't see the license.

423
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:18,885
But the color was,
I think, white, brownish color.

424
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,681
I'm sorry.

425
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:25,058
I know I'm not helping you...

426
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,688
But, please, don't tell my dad.

427
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,615
Cara.

428
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:47,330
Please, tell me that
that camera works.

429
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:02,387
Damn it.

430
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:00,987
Bingo.

431
00:38:21,174 --> 00:38:23,343
These eggs are good, mom.

432
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:30,683
Hey, you know what's weird?
Dad's website.

433
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,686
It's been three days
since the last donation.

434
00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:41,319
Yeah, well, people lose interest.

435
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:58,169
So how long are you off for?

436
00:39:02,382 --> 00:39:04,092
A few weeks.

437
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:07,095
I'll play it by ear.

438
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:15,895
I probably pushed it, you know,
going back to work too soon.

439
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:29,409
Think I can get a ride today?
Louis has a doctor's appointment.

440
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:43,089
Hey, so, dad can babysit now, right?

441
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:48,094
You won't have to take Holly
to work every day.

442
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,397
Sometime, maybe.

443
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:03,234
Yeah, we'll see.

444
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,320
What's up?

445
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:54,953
I think you'll seriously enjoy, yo.

446
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:15,348
Wait. No, no. No way.

447
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:20,853
Hey! Hey!

448
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:26,067
Hey. What the hell? This is only half.

449
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:29,028
That's right. It's your half.

450
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:35,827
Yo, where's the other half, bitch?

451
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:41,165
I mean, the whole thing was crazy.
Poor bastard. I felt sorry for him.

452
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:45,253
I think he actually thought
we were the cable guys, you know.

453
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:51,009
Anyway, sorry about
those missed calls, chief.

454
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,344
I'm changing providers.
It won't happen again.

455
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:57,390
Are you going to El Paso, Hank?

456
00:41:57,557 --> 00:42:00,893
Hell, yes.
With pointy boots and bells on.

457
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,895
Got this break in the Heisenberg case.

458
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:06,024
The blue meth, you mean?
The teenth?

459
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,735
Yeah, well,
that teenth got things rolling.

460
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:12,238
I traced it to a gas station in cibola.
That's where I got these.

461
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:16,075
The station's closed-circuit was down...
Surprise, surprise.

462
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:21,205
But I was able to pull some of these
snapshots off an atm security camera.

463
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,875
We always thought these guys
might be camper-cooking.

464
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:26,544
First off, your typical class c
motor home...

465
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:29,589
Is gonna grunt at least 5000 pounds
of interior fixtures.

466
00:42:29,756 --> 00:42:33,426
Appliances, furniture, built-ins,
5000 pounds at least, okay?

467
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,220
See how high
that suspension's riding?

468
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:39,932
No way, no how, this thing's carrying
that kind of weight.

469
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:43,936
This thing has been cleared out and
stripped down to its tight-and-curlies.

470
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:47,482
For what? Blood bank?

471
00:42:47,774 --> 00:42:49,776
Maybe a bookmobile?

472
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:53,780
There's no clear view of the plates.

473
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:56,282
Yeah, well, you can only get
so lucky, right?

474
00:42:56,449 --> 00:43:00,119
But there's no front plate. Tells me
it's likely new Mexico registration.

475
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:01,412
I check with dmv.

476
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:05,958
There are only 29 of these early-'80s
bounders registered in the state.

477
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:14,717
So I gotta go, you know,
knock on some doors.

478
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:24,227
They need you in El Paso, Hank.

479
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:28,147
You bet. I'm just gonna wrap up
this Heisenberg thing first.

480
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:30,775
- You're refusing the assignment.
- I'm not. I'll go.

481
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:32,819
It's just I need some more time.

482
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:35,822
You're not hearing me,
agent schrader.

483
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:37,865
You're out of time.

484
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:43,496
Are you going to El Paso now,
tonight?

485
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,877
It's a simple yes or no.

486
00:43:56,509 --> 00:44:01,180
No. I can't.

487
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:09,355
But that's only because
I'm really close to something big here.

488
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,701
Better get to it, then.

489
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:50,062
This is keca 480,
Albuquerque's news radio.

490
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:52,398
Keca news time, 10:13.

491
00:44:52,565 --> 00:44:55,026
Our top story this hour,
Donald margo/is...

492
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:59,197
The air-traffic controller criticized
for his role in the recent air disaster...

493
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:01,407
In which 167 persons died...

494
00:45:01,574 --> 00:45:04,202
Was rushed to an area hospital
early this morning...

495
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:07,205
Apparently the victim of
a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

496
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,916
Police won't say whether or not...

497
00:45:58,798 --> 00:46:00,466
Your half.

498
00:46:13,646 --> 00:46:15,273
Okay, okay.

499
00:46:15,297 --> 00:46:17,297
