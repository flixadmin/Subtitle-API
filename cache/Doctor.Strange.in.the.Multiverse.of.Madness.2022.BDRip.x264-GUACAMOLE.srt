1
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:04,565
- Did that kill it?
- No.

2
00:01:04,649 --> 00:01:05,858
That's how we kill it.

3
00:01:10,655 --> 00:01:12,156
The Book of Vishanti!

4
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:17,119
We can't let it take your power.

5
00:01:17,203 --> 00:01:18,204
Get to the book.

6
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:20,373
- How do we get across?
- Jump.

7
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:24,710
Hold on!

8
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:29,048
No, no, no!

9
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:10,548
It's too strong.

10
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,258
I can't hold it.

11
00:02:38,451 --> 00:02:39,452
I'm so sorry.

12
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:41,287
This is the only way.

13
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:45,499
What're you doing?

14
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,543
I can't let that thing take your power.

15
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,587
You can't control it.

16
00:02:50,713 --> 00:02:52,131
But I can.

17
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,966
But we're friends.

18
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:56,510
You're killing me.

19
00:02:56,594 --> 00:02:57,678
I know.

20
00:02:58,763 --> 00:03:01,724
But in the grand calculus
of the Multiverse,

21
00:03:01,891 --> 00:03:03,851
your sacrifice
is worth more than your...

22
00:04:28,394 --> 00:04:30,187
Excuse me. May I?

23
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:31,355
Thanks.

24
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,002
Doctor Strange.

25
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:54,253
Doctor West.

26
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:57,214
Haven't seen you in a while.

27
00:04:57,381 --> 00:05:01,427
Yeah, I was a little preoccupied
being dust there for five years, so...

28
00:05:01,594 --> 00:05:03,095
So were a lot of us.

29
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:07,516
While I was gone,

30
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:09,852
thank you for asking,

31
00:05:10,895 --> 00:05:12,688
I lost both my cats...

32
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,234
and my brother.

33
00:05:20,488 --> 00:05:21,947
I'm very sorry.

34
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,241
Thank you.

35
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:27,870
I...

36
00:05:29,914 --> 00:05:32,917
I guess what keeps me up
at night is wondering,

37
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:35,669
did it have to happen that way?

38
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,757
Was there any other path?

39
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:44,637
No.

40
00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:48,682
No, I made the only play we had.

41
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,809
Well, of course you did.

42
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:54,563
The best surgeon and the best superhero.

43
00:05:58,359 --> 00:06:00,653
But you still didn't get the girl.

44
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,161
Glass of red, please.

45
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:53,247
Oh, allow me, miss.

46
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:56,333
Little too on the nose?

47
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,168
What? For you, at my wedding?

48
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,421
Nah. I think it was perfect.

49
00:07:00,713 --> 00:07:01,839
Congratulations.

50
00:07:02,006 --> 00:07:03,173
Thank you.

51
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:05,134
There's Charlie.

52
00:07:05,301 --> 00:07:07,511
I have to introduce you
because he's kind of...

53
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:10,764
It's embarrassing,
but he's a big fan, so...

54
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:12,391
Hey, Christine...

55
00:07:14,018 --> 00:07:15,019
I should've...

56
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:19,064
I wish I'd have been different.

57
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:22,151
I never stopped caring about us.

58
00:07:22,318 --> 00:07:24,403
But I had to make sacrifices

59
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:26,697
to protect you.

60
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:28,407
I'm sorry.

61
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,913
It was never gonna work out
between us.

62
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:38,584
Why not?

63
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,586
Because, Stephen,

64
00:07:40,753 --> 00:07:43,047
you have to be the one
holding the knife.

65
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,299
And I always respected you for it,

66
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,176
but I couldn't love you for it.

67
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:53,807
How long you had that one
in the barrel?

68
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:57,311
Long time.

69
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:59,313
Yeah. I bet.

70
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,481
Look...

71
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,693
Truly, I'm just glad that you're happy.

72
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:08,030
I am.

73
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:10,282
I really, really am.

74
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:11,825
Good.

75
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:13,911
Are you?

76
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:15,871
I'm happy.

77
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:17,456
Good.

78
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:19,249
You deserve it.

79
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:30,886
Oh, man.
Look out! What is that?

80
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:33,889
Dude!

81
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:42,564
Thank you.

82
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,321
No, no.

83
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:46,253
Look out!

84
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:58,307
Do I know you?

85
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:42,452
Help!

86
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:50,168
You're welcome.

87
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:52,045
You know it's ancient custom

88
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:54,214
to bow in the presence
of the Sorcerer Supreme?

89
00:11:54,298 --> 00:11:56,383
Yeah, I'm aware of the customs.

90
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:04,808
Hold it, hold it!

91
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,376
That's incredible.

92
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:32,794
Yeah.

93
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:39,134
Oh, God!

94
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:35,816
Who's this?

95
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:37,150
Yeah, I was gonna ask the same question.

96
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:38,568
Hey, kid.

97
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:40,153
What did that creature want with you?

98
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:41,321
Where're your parents?

99
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:42,572
We'll take her back to the Sanc...

100
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:47,119
She took my Slingie.

101
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:48,870
She took your Slingie.

102
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,627
Yeah, it was crazy, man.

103
00:13:55,711 --> 00:13:56,878
Oh, my God!

104
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,257
I'm not gonna kill you, kid.

105
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,926
I just bust my ass
trying to save your life, remember?

106
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,347
Giant monsters I can clearly handle,

107
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:10,684
but what bothers me is that last night,
you were in my dream.

108
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:14,396
That wasn't a dream.

109
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:16,440
It was another universe.

110
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,737
How much experience do you guys have
with the Multiverse?

111
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:23,864
We have experience of the Multiverse.

112
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:26,033
Most recently, there was
an incident with Spider-Man.

113
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:27,409
What man?

114
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,703
Spider-Man.
He has the powers of a spider.

115
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,830
- Hence the name.
- Gross.

116
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:34,082
- Does he look like a spider?
- No. No, more like a man.

117
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,292
Climbs walls, shoots webs.

118
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,835
- Yeah. Bingo.
- Out of his butt?

119
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:38,170
- No.
- No.

120
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:39,671
Well, maybe, I don't know.

121
00:14:39,755 --> 00:14:40,881
Honestly, I hope not.

122
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:42,049
Super weird.

123
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,135
You're gonna get a stomach ache.

124
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,845
I'm from another universe.

125
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:48,680
How do you know my stomach
works the same as yours?

126
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:49,973
I don't.

127
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:52,476
I don't even know
if you're from another universe,

128
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,519
which is why I'm still sitting here,
waiting for you

129
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:55,771
to enlighten us.

130
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:56,855
Gotta say,

131
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:59,066
of the two Doctor Stranges
I've met so far...

132
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:00,692
you're not my favourite.

133
00:15:00,776 --> 00:15:02,319
Which means?

134
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:04,988
Does he not know Spanish?

135
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,866
I'm not sure
he even enjoys speaking English.

136
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:10,577
Look,
I left a very nice wedding

137
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,497
to save a smart-ass kid
from getting eaten by an octopus.

138
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,581
- Whose wedding?
- Now tell me...

139
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:15,707
- Christine's.
- You went?

140
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:16,875
Holy shit, you married Christine?

141
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:17,959
- Do you mind?
- Yes, I do.

142
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:19,211
No, I didn't. Yes.

143
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:21,463
You need to explain to me
what's going on.

144
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:23,715
Why was that octopus trying to eat you?

145
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:25,675
That thing was trying to kidnap me.

146
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:29,096
It's like a henchman
who works for a demon.

147
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:32,057
All we knew is that they wanted
to take my power for themselves.

148
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,308
What power?

149
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:36,353
I can travel the Multiverse.

150
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:37,938
What?

151
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:40,315
You can physically move
from one universe to another?

152
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:41,566
How?

153
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,610
That's the problem.
I don't know how.

154
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:45,028
Can't control it.

155
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:47,197
Only happens when
I'm really, really afraid.

156
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:51,493
Okay. And did Other Me know
how to defeat this demon?

157
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,828
Well, you guys knew

158
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:54,663
of this magical book of pure good

159
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:57,874
that gives a sorcerer whatever they need
to defeat their enemy.

160
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,085
The Book of Vishanti?

161
00:16:00,544 --> 00:16:01,670
It's not real.

162
00:16:01,837 --> 00:16:04,131
It's a fairy tale.
It doesn't exist.

163
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:05,298
Actually, it does.

164
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:08,927
I found out in the secret book you get
when you become Sorcerer Supreme.

165
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,220
Unbelievable.

166
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:11,638
You're not the Sorcerer Supreme?

167
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,473
No, I'm not the Sorcerer Supreme.

168
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:15,225
Other You was Sorcerer Supreme
of his universe.

169
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:16,351
Right. Yeah.

170
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:18,061
Although it does exist,

171
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:20,480
The Book of Vishanti
is said to be unreachable.

172
00:16:21,565 --> 00:16:22,899
It is. Except...

173
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,068
we reached it.

174
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:28,822
Then the demon caught up with us.

175
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,658
I thought you'd protect me...

176
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:35,579
but you didn't.

177
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,164
That was the fight in my dream.

178
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:40,083
That wasn't a dream.

179
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:42,127
Prove it.

180
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:51,928
It wasn't a dream.

181
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:00,437
That means...

182
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:05,025
dreams are windows into the lives
of our Multiversal selves.

183
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:08,904
That was his theory.

184
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,948
So, that recurring nightmare
where I'm running naked from a clown...

185
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,576
Somewhere out there, it's real.

186
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,495
Somewhere out there I had a ponytail.

187
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,124
There could be
more creatures coming for her.

188
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,501
The power is dangerous enough
in the hands of a kid.

189
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:24,961
Imagine if a real threat acquired it?

190
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:30,050
It occurs to me, young one,
we don't know your name.

191
00:17:33,637 --> 00:17:34,763
America Chavez.

192
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:38,058
Miss Chavez, will you come
with us to Kamar-Taj?

193
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:39,434
You'll be safe there.

194
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:42,312
How do I know you won't
betray me like he did?

195
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:45,440
I guess you're just
gonna have to trust me.

196
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:50,737
What do we do with him?

197
00:17:59,496 --> 00:18:00,956
That's gotta violate an ordinance.

198
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,582
Ah, I've buried worse.

199
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:07,045
The creature that killed him, did...

200
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:09,798
did it have the same markings
as the octopus?

201
00:18:09,965 --> 00:18:11,007
Runes.

202
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,301
This isn't sorcery.

203
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:15,637
It's witchcraft.

204
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:18,640
Do we know anyone
who's faced such a thing?

205
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:22,811
I think I might.

206
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:28,066
- Chocolate!
- Hey! What did I say?

207
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:29,276
But we couldn't wait.

208
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:30,610
But what did I say?

209
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:36,116
Go wash your hands.

210
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,914
Mom, come on.
We're too old for that.

211
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:45,250
Oh, okay.

212
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:46,501
You can tuck me in, Mom.

213
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:48,336
I will.

214
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:55,385
You know, a family is forever.

215
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:59,347
We could never truly leave each other,
even if we tried.

216
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:01,433
Mom, I changed my mind.

217
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:03,685
You can come tuck me in if you want.

218
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:05,020
Okay.

219
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:10,233
Love you.

220
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:42,599
Apples, right?

221
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:45,310
Eventually.

222
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,401
- Smells...
- Sweet.

223
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,528
I was gonna say real.

224
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:58,198
Oh, it's all very real, thanks.

225
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,242
I've put the magic behind me.

226
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:02,535
So I can see.

227
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:05,789
Well, I knew sooner or later
you'd show up,

228
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:07,957
wanting to discuss
what happened at Westview.

229
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:12,837
I made mistakes,
and people were hurt...

230
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:16,674
But you put things right in the end,
and that was never in doubt.

231
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:19,719
I'm not here to talk about Westview.

232
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:20,929
Then what are you here for?

233
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:22,263
We need your help.

234
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:26,309
With what?

235
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:28,478
What do you know about the Multiverse?

236
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:30,271
The Multiverse.

237
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:31,523
Vis had his theories.

238
00:20:31,606 --> 00:20:35,610
He believed it was real,
and dangerous.

239
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:37,278
Well, he was right about both.

240
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:40,657
We found a girl
who can somehow travel across it,

241
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,283
but she's being pursued.

242
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,993
- Pursued by who?
- Some kind of demon.

243
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:46,079
One that covets her power for itself.

244
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:50,583
We've taken her to Kamar-Taj,
and we've got our defences,

245
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:52,460
but we could use an Avenger.

246
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:54,337
There are other Avengers.

247
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:57,090
Yeah, but given the choice
between the archer with the mohawk

248
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:59,342
and several bug-themed crime fighters,

249
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:04,347
or one of the most powerful
magic-wielders on the planet...

250
00:21:04,514 --> 00:21:05,849
it's an easy call.

251
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,101
Come to Kamar-Taj.

252
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:11,479
It'll get you back on the lunch box.

253
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:16,609
What if you brought America here?

254
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:18,695
Here?

255
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:22,115
Yeah. I know what it's like
to be on your own,

256
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:24,784
hunted for abilities you never wanted,

257
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:27,370
and I can protect her.

258
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:34,836
You never told me her name, did you?

259
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:35,962
No.

260
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:38,756
No, I didn't.

261
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:45,555
You know, the Hex was the easy part.

262
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:49,267
The lying, not so much.

263
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:17,420
The Darkhold.

264
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:18,963
You're familiar with the Darkhold?

265
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,965
I know it's the Book of the Damned,

266
00:22:21,132 --> 00:22:24,552
and that it corrupts everything
and everyone that it touches.

267
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:26,346
I wonder what it's done to you.

268
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:28,890
The Darkhold only showed me the truth.

269
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:32,685
Everything I lost can be mine again.

270
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:34,395
What do you want with America?

271
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:36,439
What do you want with the Multiverse?

272
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:38,900
I'm going to leave this reality

273
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:42,153
and go to one where I can be
with my children.

274
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,614
Wanda, your children aren't real.

275
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:46,824
You created them using magic.

276
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:48,618
That's what every mother does.

277
00:22:51,412 --> 00:22:53,164
If you knew

278
00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:56,167
there was a universe

279
00:22:56,334 --> 00:22:58,044
where you were happy,

280
00:22:58,211 --> 00:23:00,171
wouldn't you want to go there?

281
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,173
I am happy.

282
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:05,093
I know better than most
what self-deception looks like.

283
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:09,430
What you're doing is a flagrant
violation of every natural law,

284
00:23:09,514 --> 00:23:11,307
and if you take that child's power,

285
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:12,392
she won't survive.

286
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,686
I don't relish hurting anyone, Stephen.

287
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,021
But she's not a child.

288
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:19,357
She's a supernatural being.

289
00:23:19,524 --> 00:23:22,110
Such raw power could wreak havoc on this

290
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:23,403
and other worlds.

291
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:24,988
Her sacrifice

292
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:27,282
would be for the greater good.

293
00:23:27,365 --> 00:23:28,908
Well, you can kiss
the lunch box goodbye,

294
00:23:28,992 --> 00:23:31,744
'cause that's the kind of justification
our enemies use.

295
00:23:31,828 --> 00:23:33,329
Is it the one you used

296
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:36,416
when you gave Thanos the Time Stone?

297
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,631
That was a war,
and I did what I had to do.

298
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:46,092
You break the rules and become a hero.

299
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:48,177
I do it, and I become the enemy.

300
00:23:49,512 --> 00:23:51,097
That doesn't seem fair.

301
00:23:52,724 --> 00:23:54,142
What happens now?

302
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,935
Return to Kamar-Taj

303
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:59,230
and prepare to hand over
America Chavez by sundown.

304
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:01,566
Peacefully.

305
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:03,985
After that...

306
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:08,448
You'll never see me again.

307
00:24:12,243 --> 00:24:13,745
And if we don't?

308
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:20,543
Then it won't be Wanda
who comes for her.

309
00:24:21,753 --> 00:24:23,755
It will be the Scarlet Witch.

310
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:35,892
The Scarlet Witch.

311
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:40,229
Wanda's gone.

312
00:24:40,897 --> 00:24:43,566
She's got the Darkhold,
and the Darkhold has her.

313
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:50,323
The Scarlet Witch is
a being of unfathomable magic.

314
00:24:51,366 --> 00:24:53,701
She can rewrite reality as she chooses,

315
00:24:55,203 --> 00:24:57,664
and is prophesised to either rule

316
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,832
or annihilate the cosmos.

317
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:03,169
She took over a whole town
using her mind.

318
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:07,131
If she gets America's power,

319
00:25:07,298 --> 00:25:09,634
she could enslave the entire Multiverse.

320
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:14,347
So, the person you went to ask for help,

321
00:25:14,514 --> 00:25:16,724
and told exactly where I am,

322
00:25:16,891 --> 00:25:18,351
is the person that's trying to kill me?

323
00:25:19,811 --> 00:25:20,853
Yeah.

324
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:25,149
Suspend teaching at once
and arm the students.

325
00:25:25,316 --> 00:25:27,860
Kamar-Taj must now become a fortress.

326
00:26:04,355 --> 00:26:06,816
It's the masters of the Hong Kong
and London Sanctums.

327
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:11,112
It's an honour to court death
alongside you once again.

328
00:26:11,446 --> 00:26:12,447
The honour is ours.

329
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:15,032
Whatever the
Sorcerer Supreme asks of us,

330
00:26:15,116 --> 00:26:16,534
it shall be done.

331
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:18,703
Extra duty men,
follow me.

332
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,913
It's ancient custom.

333
00:27:23,601 --> 00:27:25,603
Choose your words wisely.

334
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:28,064
The fate of the Multiverse
may depend on it.

335
00:27:28,231 --> 00:27:29,273
Got it.

336
00:27:30,525 --> 00:27:31,984
No pressure then.

337
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:48,292
All this for a child you met yesterday.

338
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:51,212
Wanda, you are justifiably angry.

339
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,381
You had to make terrible sacrifices.

340
00:27:53,464 --> 00:27:56,175
I blew a hole through the head
of the man I loved,

341
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:00,304
and it meant nothing.

342
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:04,433
Do not speak to me of sacrifice,
Stephen Strange.

343
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:15,486
If you give me what I want,

344
00:28:15,653 --> 00:28:18,322
I'll send you to a world where
you can be with Christine.

345
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:24,245
The full might of Kamar-Taj
stands against you.

346
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:28,165
Defensive positions, now!

347
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:37,091
Do not dare to enter
these sacred grounds.

348
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:40,678
You have no idea
just how reasonable I have been.

349
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:41,762
Yeah.

350
00:28:41,846 --> 00:28:43,514
Book of the Damned,
calling yourself a witch,

351
00:28:43,598 --> 00:28:45,057
conjuring creatures to abduct a kid,

352
00:28:45,141 --> 00:28:47,476
I don't exactly call that
being reasonable.

353
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,104
Sending those creatures
after her instead of myself

354
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:51,689
was mercy.

355
00:28:52,523 --> 00:28:56,569
And in spite of your hypocrisies,
and insults,

356
00:28:56,652 --> 00:29:00,740
I have begged you
to safely get out of my way.

357
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:04,201
You have exhausted my patience,

358
00:29:05,828 --> 00:29:09,790
but I do hope you understand
that even now,

359
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:11,459
what's about to happen,

360
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:14,503
this is me

361
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,340
being reasonable.

362
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:28,643
Hold!

363
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:31,896
Hold!

364
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:47,578
Nailed it.

365
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:53,250
Reinforce the shield.

366
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:54,961
Reinforce the shield!

367
00:29:55,044 --> 00:29:56,420
Reinforce the shield!

368
00:30:16,607 --> 00:30:18,025
She's trying to get in their heads.

369
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:21,404
Sorcerers, fortify your mind!

370
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:35,501
Run.

371
00:30:58,441 --> 00:31:00,234
The shield is down!

372
00:31:05,072 --> 00:31:06,198
Fire!

373
00:31:09,744 --> 00:31:10,745
Yes!

374
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:23,132
Take cover!

375
00:31:26,302 --> 00:31:27,928
Fire at will!

376
00:31:40,066 --> 00:31:41,108
Fall back.

377
00:31:42,318 --> 00:31:43,319
Wong!

378
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:44,612
Get out of here!

379
00:31:50,493 --> 00:31:51,577
Go, go.

380
00:31:51,869 --> 00:31:52,912
Go!

381
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:34,537
America...

382
00:32:42,211 --> 00:32:45,214
You want the girl,
you'll have to go through me.

383
00:32:45,965 --> 00:32:46,966
Fine.

384
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:58,204
We gotta get you out of here. Now.

385
00:33:58,662 --> 00:33:59,872
Wong, what happened?

386
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:01,624
Kamar-Taj has fallen.

387
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:17,097
Reflections.

388
00:34:17,264 --> 00:34:19,099
She's using the reflections.
Cover them.

389
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,050
You gave all those lives

390
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:55,844
just to keep me from my children.

391
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:57,429
You took those lives.

392
00:34:57,805 --> 00:35:00,474
You cannot be allowed
to cross into the Multiverse.

393
00:35:00,975 --> 00:35:02,726
I'm not a monster, Stephen.

394
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:04,478
I'm a mother.

395
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:06,438
Wanda, you have no children.

396
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:08,691
They don't exist.

397
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:10,567
Oh, but they do.

398
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:12,861
In every other universe.

399
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:15,281
I know they do.

400
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:17,783
Because I dream of them

401
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:21,453
every night.

402
00:35:27,835 --> 00:35:28,919
We're gonna show it.

403
00:35:29,086 --> 00:35:30,337
Mom, watch us. Mom!

404
00:35:30,421 --> 00:35:31,672
Go long. Got it!

405
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:33,173
All right, go on back, go on back.

406
00:35:33,257 --> 00:35:34,466
All right, yeah. Don't...

407
00:35:35,217 --> 00:35:36,302
Of my boys.

408
00:35:36,385 --> 00:35:37,636
Billy, don't you dare! No!

409
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,513
Of our life together.

410
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:40,889
- Here.
- Yes!

411
00:35:40,973 --> 00:35:42,516
And then back to front.

412
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:43,934
Back to front.

413
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:45,602
Can I have some?

414
00:35:45,686 --> 00:35:46,687
Please?

415
00:35:48,105 --> 00:35:49,106
- Are you guys ready?
- It's okay.

416
00:35:49,189 --> 00:35:50,232
I love you, Mom.

417
00:35:50,316 --> 00:35:51,442
Every night...

418
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:55,237
the same dream.

419
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:58,532
And every morning...

420
00:36:01,452 --> 00:36:04,621
the same nightmare.

421
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:09,209
What if you reach them?

422
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:12,629
What happens to the other you?

423
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:16,133
What happens to their mother?

424
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:04,533
You okay?

425
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:07,494
You saved me.

426
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:09,788
I hope so.

427
00:38:13,542 --> 00:38:14,543
Surprised you didn't puke.

428
00:38:15,085 --> 00:38:17,463
It's not my first weird trip, kid.

429
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:20,674
So, this is New York
in the Multi...

430
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:23,469
Yep.

431
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:24,970
There it is.

432
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:32,769
Crap.

433
00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:36,356
Cut it out.

434
00:38:39,151 --> 00:38:41,612
Yeah, you got pretty dinged up.

435
00:38:42,988 --> 00:38:44,406
We'll get you fixed.

436
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:46,116
All right, America.

437
00:38:46,909 --> 00:38:49,077
You gotta open a portal
and get us back there right now.

438
00:38:49,161 --> 00:38:50,245
I don't know how.

439
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:51,455
You just did it.

440
00:38:51,538 --> 00:38:52,539
Not on purpose.

441
00:38:52,623 --> 00:38:55,584
Wong is back there alone with Wanda,
and I'm the only hope he has.

442
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:56,835
I can't control my powers...

443
00:38:56,919 --> 00:38:58,378
You must be able to control it somehow.

444
00:38:58,462 --> 00:38:59,505
Even I could...

445
00:39:02,299 --> 00:39:03,467
Sorry.

446
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:07,179
Well, what about this
universe's version of you?

447
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:09,139
Maybe she could
control her powers.

448
00:39:09,223 --> 00:39:11,141
This universe doesn't have a me.

449
00:39:11,225 --> 00:39:13,018
- What?
- None of them do.

450
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:14,144
But how do you know that?

451
00:39:14,228 --> 00:39:15,771
'Cause I've looked.

452
00:39:17,231 --> 00:39:19,358
And 'cause I never dream.

453
00:39:26,448 --> 00:39:28,158
That's okay, kid.

454
00:39:28,325 --> 00:39:31,411
And even if you could get me back there,
I have no way of fighting Wanda.

455
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:33,080
What about The Book of Vishanti?

456
00:39:33,163 --> 00:39:34,164
What about it?

457
00:39:34,248 --> 00:39:35,499
Other You thought it could stop

458
00:39:35,582 --> 00:39:36,583
whoever was after me.

459
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,752
Yeah, well, good for Other Me.
He's not here, is he?

460
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:41,880
I don't know where it is,
so unless there's another Other Me...

461
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:45,467
We need to go find...

462
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:48,762
Other Other Me.

463
00:40:20,627 --> 00:40:21,628
We go on red?

464
00:40:21,712 --> 00:40:24,381
Rule number one of Multiversal travel,

465
00:40:24,548 --> 00:40:25,966
you don't know anything.

466
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:27,634
Right.

467
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:32,222
It's red.

468
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:36,226
So, what's rule number two?

469
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:40,647
America?

470
00:40:43,442 --> 00:40:44,526
America!

471
00:40:45,569 --> 00:40:46,570
Rule number two,

472
00:40:46,737 --> 00:40:48,030
find food.

473
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:50,157
Preferably pizza. Pizza balls.

474
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:52,284
How'd you pay for that?

475
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:53,368
It was free.

476
00:40:53,535 --> 00:40:55,787
Food's free
in most universes actually.

477
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:57,831
It's weird you guys have to pay for it.

478
00:40:57,998 --> 00:40:59,791
- Hey! You didn't pay for that.
- Right.

479
00:41:00,042 --> 00:41:01,084
Crap.

480
00:41:01,251 --> 00:41:02,461
Maybe it's not free here.

481
00:41:02,628 --> 00:41:04,588
Pizza Poppa always gets paid.

482
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:06,590
All right, Pizza Poppa, relax.
She's just a kid...

483
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:07,924
- She was hungry.
- Relax yourself there,

484
00:41:08,008 --> 00:41:09,134
Doctor Strange.

485
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:12,262
Where'd you get
this cape from anyway?

486
00:41:12,346 --> 00:41:14,056
Oh, that feels authentic.

487
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:16,058
It's not a cape, it's a cloak,
and I suggest you let go.

488
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:19,519
You took this whole suit
from the Strange Museum, didn't you?

489
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:21,480
- Strange Museum?
- You're a taker.

490
00:41:21,647 --> 00:41:23,190
Why don't you take some mustard, huh?

491
00:41:32,741 --> 00:41:34,076
Come on. It's not permanent.

492
00:41:35,285 --> 00:41:36,912
Like he'll stop in a few minutes?

493
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:39,831
About three weeks.

494
00:41:42,876 --> 00:41:45,003
Those universes we went through,

495
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:47,339
were we paint in one of them?

496
00:41:47,506 --> 00:41:49,841
Yeah, you don't wanna
get stuck in there.

497
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:51,551
It's really hard to eat.

498
00:41:52,803 --> 00:41:54,638
How many universes have you been to?

499
00:41:56,765 --> 00:41:57,849
Seventy-two.

500
00:41:58,433 --> 00:41:59,768
Seventy-three, counting this one.

501
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:00,936
That's...

502
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:02,646
That's a lot.

503
00:42:02,813 --> 00:42:04,022
Memory Lane.

504
00:42:04,106 --> 00:42:05,732
Replay your significant memories,

505
00:42:05,816 --> 00:42:07,526
now at a discounted price.

506
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:10,070
We remember so you don't forget.

507
00:42:16,493 --> 00:42:18,328
This is pretty fancy.

508
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:21,039
Did you have to take out
another student loan?

509
00:42:21,123 --> 00:42:25,001
Nah. I just sold one of those kidneys
that we operated on last week.

510
00:42:27,629 --> 00:42:30,507
So got you a little something.

511
00:42:33,135 --> 00:42:34,886
Congratulations.

512
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:36,680
What is it?

513
00:42:37,013 --> 00:42:38,348
Open it and see.

514
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:44,980
Christine, this is...

515
00:42:46,273 --> 00:42:47,941
This is amazing. Thank you.

516
00:42:49,568 --> 00:42:51,027
We don't have time for this.

517
00:42:53,864 --> 00:42:55,031
Memory Lane.

518
00:42:55,115 --> 00:42:56,867
Replay your significant memories,

519
00:42:57,033 --> 00:42:58,702
now at a discounted price.

520
00:42:58,785 --> 00:43:00,787
We remember so you don't forget.

521
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:09,337
Where's this?

522
00:43:11,298 --> 00:43:12,674
Home.

523
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,093
My moms.

524
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,096
Son mis madres.

525
00:43:18,597 --> 00:43:21,725
¿Para mí? Ay, qué linda.

526
00:43:22,726 --> 00:43:23,727
Gracias.

527
00:43:24,895 --> 00:43:26,730
A ver, te la pongo.

528
00:43:28,023 --> 00:43:29,608
Tan hermosa.

529
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:31,860
Te ves bella.

530
00:43:33,236 --> 00:43:35,322
Ándale, nos van a dar otra flor.

531
00:43:41,995 --> 00:43:43,455
America!

532
00:44:02,098 --> 00:44:04,267
You know, you were right.
This is just a waste of time.

533
00:44:04,434 --> 00:44:05,477
Hey, kid.

534
00:44:06,186 --> 00:44:09,147
That was the first time
that you opened a portal, right?

535
00:44:09,314 --> 00:44:10,315
Doesn't matter.

536
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,025
It does matter.
You lost your parents.

537
00:44:12,192 --> 00:44:14,486
I didn't lose them.
I killed them.

538
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:16,571
No. No, you did not.
Don't even think that.

539
00:44:16,738 --> 00:44:19,491
Okay, I opened a portal
with the powers I can't control

540
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:21,535
and sent them to a random,
probably deadly universe,

541
00:44:21,618 --> 00:44:22,702
- with no way to escape.
- Listen,

542
00:44:22,786 --> 00:44:25,288
if your moms are
anything like their daughter,

543
00:44:25,455 --> 00:44:26,623
they survived.

544
00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:29,543
I'm sure you'll meet them again someday.

545
00:44:33,755 --> 00:44:34,798
Not bad.

546
00:44:36,049 --> 00:44:37,509
Thanks.

547
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,971
That woman in your memory bank thing,

548
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:42,430
that was Christine, right?

549
00:44:43,682 --> 00:44:45,934
Yes, that was Christine.

550
00:44:46,101 --> 00:44:47,894
- How do you know her?
- From Other You.

551
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,688
Were they together?

552
00:44:49,771 --> 00:44:51,314
No, they didn't talk any more.

553
00:44:51,398 --> 00:44:52,482
He blew it.

554
00:44:52,566 --> 00:44:53,567
Of course.

555
00:44:54,693 --> 00:44:56,486
Did you blow it with your Christine?

556
00:44:57,988 --> 00:44:59,865
Yes, I guess I did.

557
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,032
Why?

558
00:45:01,616 --> 00:45:03,451
Complicated.

559
00:45:03,535 --> 00:45:05,036
More complicated
than being chased by a witch

560
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,121
through the Multiverse?

561
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:08,164
Yes, actually it is.

562
00:45:48,788 --> 00:45:50,248
Gave his life defeating Thanos?

563
00:45:50,332 --> 00:45:52,292
Yeah. See? We're not all bad.

564
00:45:53,543 --> 00:45:55,420
If Other You's dead,

565
00:45:55,629 --> 00:45:57,380
who's Master of the Sanctum?

566
00:46:03,386 --> 00:46:05,347
Oh, shit.

567
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:17,609
- You know him?
- Yeah. Mordo.

568
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:19,736
He was actually the first guy
who let me into Kamar-Taj.

569
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:20,820
Oh, great.

570
00:46:20,904 --> 00:46:21,905
And then he snapped

571
00:46:21,988 --> 00:46:24,074
and dedicated his life
to trying to kill me.

572
00:46:25,784 --> 00:46:27,035
Great.

573
00:46:31,665 --> 00:46:34,000
I always suspected
this day would come.

574
00:46:34,084 --> 00:46:35,085
You did?

575
00:46:35,502 --> 00:46:36,503
Yes.

576
00:46:37,337 --> 00:46:41,132
Because you always suspected
this day would come.

577
00:46:49,349 --> 00:46:51,351
My brother.

578
00:46:54,854 --> 00:46:55,855
All right.

579
00:46:57,941 --> 00:46:59,317
Come in,

580
00:46:59,401 --> 00:47:03,655
and tell me everything
about your universe.

581
00:47:08,994 --> 00:47:10,620
You go on red.

582
00:47:13,289 --> 00:47:15,250
And you're quite
formidable too, it seems.

583
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:18,253
A Multiversal traveller.

584
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:21,673
Well, thank the stars
you brought Doctor Strange to safety.

585
00:47:21,756 --> 00:47:24,509
Well, just 'cause we jumped ship
doesn't mean we're safe.

586
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:27,762
Our Wanda has the ability
to conjure demons and monsters

587
00:47:27,846 --> 00:47:30,265
to attack America in other universes.

588
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:31,891
So she has the Darkhold?

589
00:47:31,975 --> 00:47:33,476
Oh, you know of the Darkhold?

590
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:36,271
Oh, yes. We have a Darkhold
in this universe too.

591
00:47:36,438 --> 00:47:38,523
I guard it here in this Sanctum.

592
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:41,026
We would never
risk a weapon that dangerous

593
00:47:41,109 --> 00:47:42,485
falling into the wrong hands.

594
00:47:42,569 --> 00:47:43,695
Damn right.

595
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:45,572
But if your Darkhold
is anything like ours,

596
00:47:45,655 --> 00:47:47,198
I'm afraid she can do far worse

597
00:47:47,282 --> 00:47:50,827
than just summon monsters
to come after you here.

598
00:47:51,411 --> 00:47:52,412
What do you mean?

599
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:56,750
There is a spell contained
within those pages...

600
00:47:58,334 --> 00:48:00,170
corrosive to the soul,

601
00:48:01,796 --> 00:48:04,299
a desecration of reality itself.

602
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:07,218
Dreamwalking.

603
00:48:09,262 --> 00:48:12,432
A Dreamwalking sorcerer
projects their own consciousness

604
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:15,143
from their universe into another,

605
00:48:16,144 --> 00:48:19,064
possessing the body
of an alternate self.

606
00:48:21,983 --> 00:48:24,778
They may puppeteer
this unholy doppelganger

607
00:48:24,861 --> 00:48:27,238
and pursue their enemies from afar.

608
00:48:30,658 --> 00:48:33,036
The possession is not a permanent link

609
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:34,871
between realities.

610
00:48:35,038 --> 00:48:37,624
But in the fleeting time they Dreamwalk,

611
00:48:37,791 --> 00:48:41,669
they can do irreparable damage
to the universe they invade.

612
00:48:44,464 --> 00:48:47,383
So it may not be a demon that you face.

613
00:48:49,636 --> 00:48:52,430
It may be the Scarlet Witch.

614
00:48:54,516 --> 00:48:56,017
Why didn't she do that to begin with?

615
00:48:56,101 --> 00:48:58,436
Because that
was her being reasonable.

616
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:01,231
What do you know of
The Book of Vishanti?

617
00:49:01,397 --> 00:49:02,941
The Darkhold's antithesis?

618
00:49:04,067 --> 00:49:05,318
It can give a sorcerer

619
00:49:05,401 --> 00:49:08,363
whatever power they need
to vanquish their enemy.

620
00:49:10,156 --> 00:49:12,700
I need your help
to get me to it.

621
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,539
I'm sorry, Stephen.

622
00:49:19,082 --> 00:49:22,794
But I hope you,
of all people, understand

623
00:49:23,211 --> 00:49:25,338
that it is not Wanda Maximoff

624
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:27,674
who threatens our reality,

625
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,261
it's the two of you.

626
00:49:31,344 --> 00:49:33,513
- Oh, God.
- What was in that tea?

627
00:49:37,392 --> 00:49:41,104
You son of a bitch.

628
00:49:51,823 --> 00:49:53,867
The Sands of Nisanti.

629
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:57,829
I'm only acting as you would.

630
00:50:00,665 --> 00:50:02,709
She's coming.

631
00:50:25,773 --> 00:50:26,900
Boys, it's time for bed.

632
00:50:26,983 --> 00:50:28,610
Can we have
a little more ice cream?

633
00:50:28,693 --> 00:50:29,986
- Please.
- Please, please, please!

634
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:31,070
A little more, please!

635
00:50:31,154 --> 00:50:32,530
Hey, don't make Mom
out to be the bad guy.

636
00:50:32,614 --> 00:50:33,698
You know who's the best?

637
00:50:33,781 --> 00:50:36,159
- Who?
- 2003 Tigers.

638
00:50:36,242 --> 00:50:37,243
They suck.

639
00:50:37,327 --> 00:50:39,370
They're so bad they suck egg.

640
00:50:39,454 --> 00:50:41,206
No, they don't.
They're the best.

641
00:50:41,289 --> 00:50:43,082
- Doofus.
- Doofus 2.

642
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:45,084
Triple infinity doofus.

643
00:50:45,168 --> 00:50:48,463
Infinity infinity
googolplex quadruple doofus.

644
00:50:48,630 --> 00:50:52,050
Quintuple infinity...
Crazy doofus.

645
00:50:52,217 --> 00:50:53,843
Googolplex doofus.

646
00:51:45,061 --> 00:51:46,104
Mom?

647
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:53,194
Yes, sweetheart?

648
00:51:53,278 --> 00:51:54,696
Where are you going?

649
00:51:58,408 --> 00:52:00,868
Just to take out the trash.

650
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,788
Can we show you something?

651
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:08,293
Mom, hurry, come on!

652
00:52:08,376 --> 00:52:09,794
Come on, it's important.

653
00:52:09,877 --> 00:52:10,878
Mom.

654
00:52:10,962 --> 00:52:12,714
You'll like it.

655
00:52:12,797 --> 00:52:15,425
Come on. Hurry up.

656
00:52:15,508 --> 00:52:16,634
It's important.

657
00:52:17,593 --> 00:52:20,430
Okay, so, Mom, listen to this...

658
00:52:20,513 --> 00:52:21,514
I'm gonna start it.

659
00:52:21,597 --> 00:52:22,849
- No, I wanna start it.
- I wanna start it.

660
00:52:22,932 --> 00:52:23,933
- I want to start!
- No, I want to start!

661
00:52:24,017 --> 00:52:25,059
- No! I want to start.
- I want to start.

662
00:52:25,143 --> 00:52:29,647
Why don't you both start it,

663
00:52:29,731 --> 00:52:33,026
whatever it is, together?

664
00:52:34,193 --> 00:52:35,486
- Okay.
- Okay.

665
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:36,821
- You ready?
- Yeah.

666
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:39,615
Three, two, one, go.

667
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:43,161
We like ice cream

668
00:52:43,244 --> 00:52:46,664
Like every child should

669
00:52:46,748 --> 00:52:50,418
And if we get some ice cream

670
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:55,840
We promise to be good

671
00:53:23,868 --> 00:53:24,869
You're alive.

672
00:53:25,578 --> 00:53:26,579
Yes.

673
00:53:27,205 --> 00:53:29,123
But so many others were lost.

674
00:53:31,042 --> 00:53:32,418
Set me free.

675
00:53:32,585 --> 00:53:34,087
I need to destroy the book.

676
00:53:34,253 --> 00:53:37,048
No. It cannot be you.

677
00:53:44,847 --> 00:53:47,100
Sara. No, no!

678
00:54:05,785 --> 00:54:07,203
Mom!

679
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:08,579
What happened?

680
00:54:10,957 --> 00:54:12,250
- What?
- Are you okay?

681
00:54:15,086 --> 00:54:17,380
Okay. Billy, Tommy.

682
00:54:18,965 --> 00:54:19,966
What?

683
00:54:25,805 --> 00:54:29,684
No, no, no.

684
00:54:49,829 --> 00:54:51,831
I need the Darkhold's spells.

685
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:54,459
You are the Sorcerer Supreme.

686
00:54:54,667 --> 00:54:55,877
Tell me what you know.

687
00:54:57,670 --> 00:54:59,464
You're gonna have to kill me, witch.

688
00:55:00,173 --> 00:55:01,340
Not you.

689
00:55:02,758 --> 00:55:04,010
Them.

690
00:55:10,141 --> 00:55:11,309
Wanda, stop.

691
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:15,313
Wanda, please!

692
00:55:20,318 --> 00:55:22,320
The Darkhold was a copy!

693
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:26,282
A copy?

694
00:55:26,449 --> 00:55:27,742
Legend speaks of a mountain

695
00:55:27,909 --> 00:55:30,578
with the wretched spells you seek
carved into its walls.

696
00:55:31,913 --> 00:55:34,582
It's there the Darkhold was transcribed.

697
00:55:35,541 --> 00:55:36,792
Mount Wundagore.

698
00:55:37,793 --> 00:55:39,128
Wundagore?

699
00:55:39,921 --> 00:55:41,797
No one has survived the journey.

700
00:55:46,177 --> 00:55:48,888
Perhaps we will be the exception.

701
00:55:56,229 --> 00:55:57,605
Hey!

702
00:55:57,688 --> 00:55:59,649
Hey!

703
00:56:12,161 --> 00:56:13,955
This universe sucks.

704
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:17,959
Cloak?

705
00:56:29,428 --> 00:56:30,429
Hey.

706
00:56:32,223 --> 00:56:33,474
Hey, lab coat.

707
00:56:34,225 --> 00:56:35,309
Where the hell are we?

708
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:37,728
Look, I don't know who you are,

709
00:56:37,812 --> 00:56:39,689
or what you think
you're trying to do here,

710
00:56:39,772 --> 00:56:41,190
but these situations don't usually

711
00:56:41,274 --> 00:56:42,316
work out well

712
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,569
for the nameless scientists, so just...

713
00:56:49,156 --> 00:56:50,449
Christine?

714
00:56:52,285 --> 00:56:53,369
Hello, Stephen.

715
00:56:53,869 --> 00:56:55,037
Ay Dios.

716
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:57,039
Miss Chavez.

717
00:56:58,499 --> 00:57:00,001
To answer your question,

718
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:02,628
you are in a highly secure
research facility.

719
00:57:02,795 --> 00:57:05,006
The two of you,
along with your sentient cloak,

720
00:57:05,089 --> 00:57:07,049
are here for surveillance and testing.

721
00:57:07,133 --> 00:57:09,260
Testing?

722
00:57:09,343 --> 00:57:11,929
Well, yes.
You're visitors from another universe.

723
00:57:12,096 --> 00:57:15,641
Your magnetic signatures
could be radioactive,

724
00:57:15,808 --> 00:57:18,436
you may be carrying diseases
we just don't have treatments for.

725
00:57:19,228 --> 00:57:22,148
Hence, these amazing
polycarbonate fish bowls.

726
00:57:23,608 --> 00:57:26,235
I assume I have you
to thank for these then?

727
00:57:26,736 --> 00:57:29,947
Yes. I developed those
using the Sands of Nisanti.

728
00:57:30,114 --> 00:57:32,408
One of 838 Stephen's magical relics.

729
00:57:32,575 --> 00:57:33,618
838 Stephen?

730
00:57:33,701 --> 00:57:35,286
Is that some kind of cyborg me, or...

731
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:37,288
Our universe is 838,

732
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:39,749
and we've designated yours 616.

733
00:57:39,999 --> 00:57:42,752
You guys sure must know
a lot about the Multiverse

734
00:57:42,918 --> 00:57:45,087
if you got someone
going around naming realities.

735
00:57:45,254 --> 00:57:46,255
Yes.

736
00:57:47,006 --> 00:57:48,257
Me.

737
00:57:48,424 --> 00:57:50,426
I'm a senior fellow
with the Baxter Foundation,

738
00:57:50,509 --> 00:57:52,553
and I specialise
in Multiversal research.

739
00:57:54,889 --> 00:57:57,016
So, how'd you end up working here?

740
00:57:57,099 --> 00:57:59,060
Wherever here is.

741
00:57:59,226 --> 00:58:00,561
Well, I volunteered.

742
00:58:01,145 --> 00:58:02,521
At your funeral.

743
00:58:03,731 --> 00:58:05,066
Thank you for going.

744
00:58:05,566 --> 00:58:07,610
Your injuries, they're similar,

745
00:58:07,693 --> 00:58:08,861
but they're not identical.

746
00:58:08,944 --> 00:58:10,154
It's fascinating.

747
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:20,247
What were we to each other
in this universe?

748
00:58:23,918 --> 00:58:25,920
We never quite figured that out.

749
00:58:26,212 --> 00:58:27,338
Yeah?

750
00:58:28,964 --> 00:58:31,050
Well, that's something we got in common.

751
00:58:33,844 --> 00:58:37,098
Christine, you gotta let us out of here.

752
00:58:37,932 --> 00:58:39,642
Everyone's in real danger.

753
00:58:39,725 --> 00:58:41,769
Look, I know you don't know me...

754
00:58:41,894 --> 00:58:42,895
And I don't want to.

755
00:58:43,437 --> 00:58:45,940
Whatever I was to you in your universe

756
00:58:46,023 --> 00:58:47,233
does not matter.

757
00:58:48,484 --> 00:58:49,568
Why not?

758
00:58:54,532 --> 00:58:56,242
Because you're dangerous, Stephen.

759
00:58:58,035 --> 00:59:00,579
Someone from my universe
wants that girl,

760
00:59:00,663 --> 00:59:03,457
and she's gonna rip this place
apart atom-by-atom

761
00:59:03,541 --> 00:59:05,167
until she gets what she wants.

762
00:59:05,251 --> 00:59:07,628
So I don't care
if you're from the Avengers

763
00:59:07,712 --> 00:59:08,713
or S.H.I.E.L.D.

764
00:59:08,796 --> 00:59:09,839
We're neither.

765
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:16,929
Well, what then?

766
00:59:17,096 --> 00:59:18,139
HYDRA?

767
00:59:18,222 --> 00:59:22,393
The Illuminati will see you now.

768
00:59:22,476 --> 00:59:23,769
The Illumi-what-y?

769
00:59:31,861 --> 00:59:33,487
Don't let anyone hurt that kid.

770
00:59:37,783 --> 00:59:39,160
It's gonna be okay.

771
01:00:08,773 --> 01:00:11,358
You couldn't portal us up there?

772
01:00:11,525 --> 01:00:13,944
My magic can only take us so far.

773
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:16,614
Masters of the Mystic Arts
weren't meant to tread

774
01:00:16,781 --> 01:00:19,158
upon the forbidden grounds of Wundagore.

775
01:00:44,308 --> 01:00:48,854
Eons ago, the first demon, Chthon,

776
01:00:48,938 --> 01:00:52,650
carved his dark magic into this tomb.

777
01:00:52,817 --> 01:00:57,571
These same spells were later transcribed
into the Darkhold.

778
01:01:13,003 --> 01:01:16,549
There's no telling
what soulless monstrosities lie within.

779
01:01:59,258 --> 01:02:00,968
They've been waiting for me.

780
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:10,978
This isn't a tomb.

781
01:02:15,149 --> 01:02:16,734
It's a throne.

782
01:02:51,769 --> 01:02:53,479
Stephen Strange,

783
01:02:54,146 --> 01:02:56,774
you are now called
before the Illuminati.

784
01:02:56,982 --> 01:02:59,234
I, Baron Karl Mordo,

785
01:02:59,318 --> 01:03:00,819
the Sorcerer Supreme, do hereby...

786
01:03:00,903 --> 01:03:02,029
Karl?

787
01:03:06,325 --> 01:03:08,452
Captain Carter.

788
01:03:08,535 --> 01:03:09,745
The first Avenger.

789
01:03:10,788 --> 01:03:12,122
Blackagar Boltagon.

790
01:03:12,206 --> 01:03:15,125
Keeper of the Terrigen Mists,
the Inhuman king.

791
01:03:15,292 --> 01:03:17,419
Blackagar Boltagard?

792
01:03:17,836 --> 01:03:19,046
Hidigy hidithere.

793
01:03:20,839 --> 01:03:23,384
Captain Marvel.
Defender of the cosmos.

794
01:03:25,427 --> 01:03:27,471
And the smartest man alive,

795
01:03:27,638 --> 01:03:30,224
Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four.

796
01:03:31,558 --> 01:03:32,559
Hello, Stephen.

797
01:03:32,643 --> 01:03:35,145
Fantastic Four.
Didn't you guys chart in the '60s?

798
01:03:35,229 --> 01:03:37,398
I'm sorry, is this a joke to you?

799
01:03:37,481 --> 01:03:38,899
Well, there's a guy over there
with a fork on his head,

800
01:03:38,983 --> 01:03:40,275
so, yeah, a little bit.

801
01:03:41,735 --> 01:03:44,279
Be grateful Black Bolt doesn't
engage you in conversation.

802
01:03:44,363 --> 01:03:46,115
Why? Does he have bad breath?

803
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:48,325
This Strange is even
more arrogant than ours.

804
01:03:48,575 --> 01:03:50,536
No, just more alive.

805
01:03:50,703 --> 01:03:51,829
For now.

806
01:03:53,414 --> 01:03:54,790
Stephen, your arrival here

807
01:03:54,873 --> 01:03:57,292
confuses and destabilises reality.

808
01:03:58,127 --> 01:03:59,712
The larger the footprint
you leave behind,

809
01:03:59,795 --> 01:04:01,588
the greater the risk of an Incursion.

810
01:04:01,672 --> 01:04:02,673
Incursion?

811
01:04:02,756 --> 01:04:03,841
An Incursion occurs

812
01:04:03,924 --> 01:04:07,011
when the boundary
between two universes erodes

813
01:04:07,177 --> 01:04:08,387
and they collide,

814
01:04:09,138 --> 01:04:13,142
destroying one or both entirely.

815
01:04:13,809 --> 01:04:16,562
Your alternate self
created the Illuminati

816
01:04:16,645 --> 01:04:19,189
to make difficult decisions
that no one else could.

817
01:04:19,273 --> 01:04:23,068
Today, we're here to determine
what to do with you and the child.

818
01:04:23,235 --> 01:04:24,987
So, before we vote,

819
01:04:25,070 --> 01:04:28,824
if you got anything serious to say,
now's the time.

820
01:04:28,907 --> 01:04:30,200
Yeah, I do.

821
01:04:30,284 --> 01:04:31,660
If it's Incursions you're worried about,

822
01:04:31,744 --> 01:04:34,455
do you seriously think I'm a bigger
threat than the Scarlet Witch?

823
01:04:34,538 --> 01:04:37,666
Oh, we can handle your little witch
if she decides to Dreamwalk.

824
01:04:37,833 --> 01:04:39,084
No. No, you cannot.

825
01:04:39,168 --> 01:04:41,253
Not unless you give me
The Book of Vishanti.

826
01:04:41,336 --> 01:04:42,796
We appreciate your concern, Stephen,

827
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:45,049
but it's not the Scarlet Witch
that we fear.

828
01:04:45,132 --> 01:04:46,884
From our experience, the greatest danger

829
01:04:46,967 --> 01:04:48,927
to the Multiverse, it turns out,

830
01:04:49,094 --> 01:04:50,721
is Doctor Strange.

831
01:04:51,597 --> 01:04:53,640
Wait. Your Doctor Strange?

832
01:04:53,724 --> 01:04:56,310
Earth's mightiest hero
who died defeating Thanos?

833
01:04:56,393 --> 01:04:58,187
We should tell him the truth.

834
01:05:06,278 --> 01:05:07,529
Our final member,

835
01:05:08,781 --> 01:05:10,616
Professor Charles Xavier.

836
01:05:12,493 --> 01:05:13,494
What truth?

837
01:05:13,577 --> 01:05:16,246
That's not how our Strange died.

838
01:05:34,014 --> 01:05:36,016
You're wondering what happens now.

839
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:38,018
No.

840
01:05:38,185 --> 01:05:39,812
That I've already accepted.

841
01:05:40,479 --> 01:05:41,688
But I do wonder

842
01:05:43,190 --> 01:05:46,735
when you could force America
to send you to any universe you want,

843
01:05:46,902 --> 01:05:48,779
why take her power for your own?

844
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:50,697
You know it would kill her.

845
01:05:50,781 --> 01:05:52,616
For Billy and Tommy, to protect them.

846
01:05:53,826 --> 01:05:55,160
What if they get sick?

847
01:05:56,286 --> 01:05:59,373
In the infinite Multiverse,
there's a cure for every illness.

848
01:06:00,666 --> 01:06:04,002
A solution to every problem.

849
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:08,340
I won't lose them again.

850
01:06:08,423 --> 01:06:11,510
Try as you might, Wanda,
you cannot control everything.

851
01:06:11,593 --> 01:06:13,220
But I can.

852
01:06:13,387 --> 01:06:15,013
Look around you.

853
01:06:15,639 --> 01:06:17,891
It's carved in stone.

854
01:06:19,935 --> 01:06:22,271
I was meant to rule everything.

855
01:06:27,025 --> 01:06:28,986
But that's not what I want.

856
01:06:29,695 --> 01:06:30,946
I just want my boys.

857
01:06:31,029 --> 01:06:33,073
At the cost of a child's life?

858
01:06:34,283 --> 01:06:35,826
Is there no peace in knowing

859
01:06:35,909 --> 01:06:38,287
that even though you can't be
with the ones you love,

860
01:06:38,370 --> 01:06:40,581
there are worlds
where you are together?

861
01:06:40,747 --> 01:06:41,748
Is that not enough?

862
01:06:42,291 --> 01:06:43,542
No.

863
01:07:21,288 --> 01:07:24,082
Our Strange did not die
defeating Thanos.

864
01:07:24,708 --> 01:07:26,418
We were at war.

865
01:07:26,585 --> 01:07:30,297
While the rest of us banded together
to try to stop Thanos,

866
01:07:30,464 --> 01:07:34,426
Stephen, as always,
chose to go it alone.

867
01:07:34,593 --> 01:07:36,303
He turned to the Darkhold,

868
01:07:36,470 --> 01:07:38,055
began Dreamwalking,

869
01:07:38,222 --> 01:07:40,766
in hopes that our salvation
might lie in the Multiverse.

870
01:07:41,141 --> 01:07:42,351
And guess what?

871
01:07:42,517 --> 01:07:45,103
It didn't.
But he kept doing it anyway.

872
01:07:45,312 --> 01:07:47,272
One night,
you called us all together,

873
01:07:47,356 --> 01:07:49,399
confessed that
you had been Dreamwalking,

874
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:52,861
and in your words,
things had gotten out of hand.

875
01:07:53,028 --> 01:07:55,322
You never told us the details
of what had happened,

876
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:57,324
only that you had
inadvertently triggered

877
01:07:57,407 --> 01:07:58,575
an Incursion.

878
01:07:59,076 --> 01:08:00,452
You, our friend,

879
01:08:00,994 --> 01:08:04,456
had caused the annihilation
of another universe.

880
01:08:04,831 --> 01:08:07,251
Everyone in that reality died.

881
01:08:07,417 --> 01:08:08,418
Everyone.

882
01:08:08,585 --> 01:08:10,754
Stephen renounced the Darkhold's evil

883
01:08:10,921 --> 01:08:13,048
and helped us find
The Book of Vishanti,

884
01:08:13,215 --> 01:08:17,344
a weapon we did use together
to defeat Thanos.

885
01:08:17,511 --> 01:08:19,680
But one final threat remained.

886
01:08:47,666 --> 01:08:50,085
I shall miss you, my friend.

887
01:08:53,964 --> 01:08:55,340
I'm ready.

888
01:09:03,432 --> 01:09:05,642
I'm sorry.

889
01:09:27,331 --> 01:09:28,957
Did you tell Christine?

890
01:09:30,208 --> 01:09:31,293
Yes.

891
01:09:36,965 --> 01:09:37,966
The statue...

892
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:39,509
What about the statue?

893
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:43,764
You built a statue.

894
01:09:43,847 --> 01:09:45,557
The world needs heroes.

895
01:09:46,350 --> 01:09:47,351
We made the difficult choice

896
01:09:47,434 --> 01:09:49,436
because we knew what
our Strange was capable of.

897
01:09:51,063 --> 01:09:52,439
What, perhaps,

898
01:09:52,522 --> 01:09:55,233
every Doctor Strange is capable of.

899
01:09:59,071 --> 01:10:00,364
The building's been breached.

900
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:02,491
No shit, genius.

901
01:10:02,991 --> 01:10:04,576
Status report on sentries.

902
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:07,996
Stop where you...

903
01:10:08,538 --> 01:10:10,540
Get back!

904
01:10:15,087 --> 01:10:17,130
Stop where you are...

905
01:10:17,214 --> 01:10:18,507
She's heading for the child.

906
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:20,384
Watch him.
We'll vote on our return.

907
01:10:22,135 --> 01:10:24,930
Stephen, should you manage
to escape this chamber,

908
01:10:25,097 --> 01:10:27,099
you must guide America Chavez.

909
01:10:27,265 --> 01:10:28,558
What the hell are you saying?

910
01:10:28,683 --> 01:10:31,019
Save the girl
and get to The Book of Vishanti.

911
01:10:31,186 --> 01:10:32,646
What? You have the book here?

912
01:10:32,729 --> 01:10:35,065
Yes. You built a waypoint.

913
01:10:35,148 --> 01:10:37,317
Charles, we cannot trust him.

914
01:10:37,484 --> 01:10:39,444
I believe we can.

915
01:10:40,195 --> 01:10:42,739
Just because someone stumbles
and loses their way

916
01:10:42,823 --> 01:10:44,658
doesn't mean they're lost forever.

917
01:10:45,367 --> 01:10:49,121
We will see what kind
of Doctor Strange you are.

918
01:10:49,913 --> 01:10:50,914
Thank you.

919
01:10:51,790 --> 01:10:53,458
Perimeter breakdown.

920
01:10:53,542 --> 01:10:56,628
All sentries engage.

921
01:10:58,296 --> 01:10:59,297
Everybody out.

922
01:10:59,381 --> 01:11:00,924
- Intruder approaching.
- Now!

923
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:04,386
It's Wanda.

924
01:11:17,399 --> 01:11:19,860
Ultron commands you to halt.

925
01:11:21,987 --> 01:11:24,030
Ultron commands...

926
01:11:27,159 --> 01:11:28,702
Hurry, hurry! She's coming!

927
01:11:33,248 --> 01:11:34,416
Oh, no.

928
01:11:55,937 --> 01:11:57,189
Wanda, stop.

929
01:11:58,023 --> 01:12:00,817
You've possessed an innocent woman,
but you can still do the right thing.

930
01:12:01,735 --> 01:12:02,903
Let her go.

931
01:12:06,072 --> 01:12:07,073
Please.

932
01:12:07,741 --> 01:12:10,785
I have children of my own.
I understand your pain.

933
01:12:10,952 --> 01:12:13,288
Is their mother still alive?

934
01:12:14,498 --> 01:12:15,499
Yes.

935
01:12:15,665 --> 01:12:19,878
Good. There will be
someone left to raise them.

936
01:12:22,506 --> 01:12:26,510
Wanda, Black Bolt could destroy you
with one whisper from his mouth.

937
01:12:28,428 --> 01:12:29,429
What mouth?

938
01:13:27,279 --> 01:13:30,615
Take me to The Book of Vishanti,
so that we can fight her together.

939
01:13:30,782 --> 01:13:32,742
You are in no position to give orders.

940
01:13:34,077 --> 01:13:37,080
My vote will conclude these proceedings
when they return.

941
01:13:49,509 --> 01:13:50,635
Haven't you had enough?

942
01:13:51,845 --> 01:13:53,263
Oh, I could do this all day.

943
01:14:29,633 --> 01:14:32,260
Get the hell out of my universe!

944
01:15:06,211 --> 01:15:07,837
They're not coming back.

945
01:15:08,004 --> 01:15:11,216
And you just cast your vote now
to kill your friends.

946
01:15:15,095 --> 01:15:16,721
Not that that ever bothered you before.

947
01:15:19,808 --> 01:15:22,018
You know, you hated me
where I came from.

948
01:15:22,185 --> 01:15:23,853
And I bet secretly, my brother,

949
01:15:23,937 --> 01:15:25,188
you hated me here.

950
01:15:25,271 --> 01:15:27,232
You must've been so jealous.

951
01:15:27,732 --> 01:15:28,733
Do you know what?

952
01:15:28,817 --> 01:15:30,944
I bet you were thrilled
when you heard I'd been corrupted.

953
01:15:31,027 --> 01:15:32,862
Hell, you probably gave me
the Darkhold to begin with...

954
01:15:32,946 --> 01:15:34,781
You know nothing of this universe!

955
01:15:34,864 --> 01:15:38,576
I know that killing Stephen Strange
was your ticket to getting the Sanctum,

956
01:15:38,743 --> 01:15:40,203
to becoming Sorcerer Supreme,

957
01:15:40,370 --> 01:15:42,038
and to joining
your little circus of clowns,

958
01:15:42,122 --> 01:15:43,123
the Illuminati.

959
01:15:43,206 --> 01:15:44,666
I'm ready...

960
01:15:47,711 --> 01:15:50,630
to cast my vote now.

961
01:16:55,779 --> 01:16:57,572
I think I'm beginning to understand

962
01:16:57,989 --> 01:17:01,618
why your Mordo
didn't like you very much!

963
01:17:04,245 --> 01:17:05,246
You're sealed shut!

964
01:17:15,131 --> 01:17:16,800
Okay. Get back.

965
01:17:34,734 --> 01:17:35,819
Enough!

966
01:18:30,915 --> 01:18:32,959
Help me. Please.

967
01:18:33,126 --> 01:18:35,753
Wanda Maximoff,
your mind is being held hostage

968
01:18:35,837 --> 01:18:36,921
by your alternate self.

969
01:18:40,633 --> 01:18:41,759
Grab my hand.

970
01:18:42,635 --> 01:18:45,013
Perhaps, if I can pull you
from under the rubble,

971
01:18:45,430 --> 01:18:46,681
the spell will break.

972
01:19:33,311 --> 01:19:35,480
Hey! You all right?

973
01:19:36,940 --> 01:19:37,941
You okay?

974
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:40,401
Hey.

975
01:19:41,945 --> 01:19:43,696
- You all right?
- Yeah.

976
01:19:45,448 --> 01:19:46,449
Hey.

977
01:19:47,951 --> 01:19:49,369
She fixed him.

978
01:19:49,452 --> 01:19:50,745
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

979
01:19:50,828 --> 01:19:52,872
Xavier said I built a waypoint
to The Book of Vishanti.

980
01:19:52,956 --> 01:19:53,998
Can you take us there?

981
01:19:54,082 --> 01:19:55,083
How am I supposed to trust you?

982
01:19:55,166 --> 01:19:57,293
I know what happened,
and I'm sorry for what he did,

983
01:19:57,377 --> 01:19:59,545
but believe me,
The Book of Vishanti is the only way.

984
01:19:59,629 --> 01:20:00,755
Yeah. Your way.

985
01:20:00,838 --> 01:20:03,132
You sound a lot
like my Stephen right now.

986
01:20:03,216 --> 01:20:04,634
He had to be the one holding the knife,

987
01:20:04,717 --> 01:20:07,011
and then that knife
killed a trillion people.

988
01:20:07,095 --> 01:20:08,763
This Stephen is different.

989
01:20:09,597 --> 01:20:10,598
He is.

990
01:20:10,765 --> 01:20:12,558
It doesn't matter
about all the other Stephens.

991
01:20:13,935 --> 01:20:15,311
You're not like them.

992
01:20:19,273 --> 01:20:20,400
Smart kid.

993
01:20:24,946 --> 01:20:25,947
Give me your hand.

994
01:20:29,742 --> 01:20:32,412
Do not make me regret this.

995
01:20:32,578 --> 01:20:33,663
I won't.

996
01:20:35,123 --> 01:20:36,874
- Okay, can we go now?
- Yeah, follow me.

997
01:20:51,472 --> 01:20:52,473
Where's that tunnel go?

998
01:20:52,765 --> 01:20:54,183
Under the river.

999
01:21:01,983 --> 01:21:03,359
Go, go, go, go, go!

1000
01:22:07,799 --> 01:22:09,801
Where did she go?

1001
01:22:20,812 --> 01:22:22,021
I warned you.

1002
01:22:23,022 --> 01:22:25,316
Other Wanda, if you're in there,

1003
01:22:25,483 --> 01:22:26,526
hold your breath.

1004
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:38,204
- Did you kill her?
- No, just bought us some time.

1005
01:22:40,331 --> 01:22:41,624
The Book's through here.

1006
01:22:41,707 --> 01:22:42,959
But only Stephen's ever opened it.

1007
01:22:53,344 --> 01:22:54,512
Shit.

1008
01:22:55,471 --> 01:22:56,973
An enchantment
that's specific to me,

1009
01:22:57,056 --> 01:22:58,057
something only I would know.

1010
01:22:58,141 --> 01:22:59,892
- Wait. Stephen.
- Come on.

1011
01:23:00,393 --> 01:23:02,645
Come on.

1012
01:23:02,812 --> 01:23:04,313
Stephen.

1013
01:23:12,697 --> 01:23:13,698
Yeah.

1014
01:23:16,659 --> 01:23:17,660
Thank you.

1015
01:23:18,286 --> 01:23:19,745
Sure.

1016
01:23:25,209 --> 01:23:26,544
Open sesame.

1017
01:23:59,202 --> 01:24:00,203
Come on, kid.

1018
01:24:00,828 --> 01:24:02,038
You got this.

1019
01:24:03,789 --> 01:24:05,082
We got this.

1020
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:08,544
Yeah.

1021
01:24:16,552 --> 01:24:17,553
You all right?

1022
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:18,846
Yeah.

1023
01:24:21,224 --> 01:24:24,435
This is the Gap Junction,
the space between universes.

1024
01:24:37,657 --> 01:24:39,116
All right, Book.

1025
01:24:42,411 --> 01:24:43,788
Give me what I need.

1026
01:25:02,306 --> 01:25:03,307
- No!
- No!

1027
01:25:56,861 --> 01:25:58,154
My boys.

1028
01:26:09,874 --> 01:26:11,375
This isn't what your children
would want.

1029
01:26:27,516 --> 01:26:28,934
They'll never know.

1030
01:26:29,101 --> 01:26:30,186
Maybe not.

1031
01:26:30,770 --> 01:26:31,771
But you will.

1032
01:26:35,733 --> 01:26:36,984
Oh, no.

1033
01:26:37,151 --> 01:26:38,486
Oh, crap.

1034
01:26:40,196 --> 01:26:42,990
It's like this reality
collapsed in on itself.

1035
01:26:43,074 --> 01:26:44,116
Yeah.

1036
01:26:44,617 --> 01:26:47,370
Or two realities collided.

1037
01:26:47,453 --> 01:26:48,621
Come on.

1038
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:50,790
America doesn't have long.

1039
01:26:51,207 --> 01:26:52,583
So where are we going?

1040
01:26:52,666 --> 01:26:54,835
Well,
if there's still a sanctum

1041
01:26:54,919 --> 01:26:55,961
in this universe,

1042
01:26:57,088 --> 01:27:00,633
then there might be
another Other Other Me,

1043
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:03,302
and that's our best shot
of getting back to her.

1044
01:27:15,773 --> 01:27:19,110
Well, I can see why you guys
were so worried about Incursions.

1045
01:27:21,237 --> 01:27:22,655
Whatever happened,

1046
01:27:23,739 --> 01:27:25,908
this universe's you
didn't do a very good job

1047
01:27:25,991 --> 01:27:27,201
of stopping it.

1048
01:27:37,628 --> 01:27:39,463
I'll tell him you said that.

1049
01:28:39,857 --> 01:28:40,983
Hello?

1050
01:28:48,824 --> 01:28:50,075
Stop where you are.

1051
01:28:52,495 --> 01:28:54,246
How did you get here?

1052
01:28:55,414 --> 01:28:56,582
By accident.

1053
01:28:58,584 --> 01:28:59,585
Who are you?

1054
01:29:00,628 --> 01:29:01,629
What are you?

1055
01:29:01,712 --> 01:29:03,797
I'm just one of us.

1056
01:29:04,048 --> 01:29:05,549
From the Multiverse?

1057
01:29:05,633 --> 01:29:06,842
That's right.

1058
01:29:08,761 --> 01:29:09,762
Prove it.

1059
01:29:13,182 --> 01:29:14,517
We had a sister.

1060
01:29:15,059 --> 01:29:16,060
Donna.

1061
01:29:18,896 --> 01:29:19,939
But she...

1062
01:29:21,524 --> 01:29:23,484
She died when we were kids.

1063
01:29:25,611 --> 01:29:26,654
How?

1064
01:29:28,072 --> 01:29:33,827
We were playing
on a frozen lake and...

1065
01:29:37,915 --> 01:29:39,833
she fell through the ice.

1066
01:29:46,131 --> 01:29:47,967
I couldn't save her.

1067
01:29:50,177 --> 01:29:51,845
Sounds about right.

1068
01:29:54,515 --> 01:29:56,976
But we don't talk about that, do we?

1069
01:29:58,310 --> 01:29:59,478
No, we don't.

1070
01:30:01,105 --> 01:30:03,816
Suppose your reality
wasn't always like this.

1071
01:30:03,899 --> 01:30:06,443
I suspect it was
somewhat like yours until...

1072
01:30:06,527 --> 01:30:07,528
Until?

1073
01:30:09,488 --> 01:30:10,906
Until I lost.

1074
01:30:12,324 --> 01:30:13,951
To whom?

1075
01:30:17,496 --> 01:30:18,831
What do you want?

1076
01:30:19,582 --> 01:30:22,084
I just want to get home.

1077
01:30:22,293 --> 01:30:23,836
Yeah? Believe me,

1078
01:30:24,003 --> 01:30:26,880
I've been trying to leave
this place for a long time.

1079
01:30:28,048 --> 01:30:29,383
Darkhold.

1080
01:30:29,550 --> 01:30:32,303
You guard the Darkhold in this universe?

1081
01:30:32,469 --> 01:30:33,512
Yeah.

1082
01:30:34,138 --> 01:30:35,180
For good reason.

1083
01:30:35,389 --> 01:30:36,432
That's a start.

1084
01:30:36,515 --> 01:30:37,683
I could use it.

1085
01:30:37,766 --> 01:30:39,643
It could help me to communicate
with my universe.

1086
01:30:39,727 --> 01:30:40,894
Careful.

1087
01:30:41,812 --> 01:30:44,398
The Darkhold exacts a heavy toll.

1088
01:30:44,481 --> 01:30:47,401
I don't mean to be callous,

1089
01:30:47,484 --> 01:30:50,446
but how much of a heavier toll
is there left to exact?

1090
01:30:50,529 --> 01:30:52,781
Not just on its reality.

1091
01:30:53,157 --> 01:30:54,408
On its reader.

1092
01:30:55,492 --> 01:30:57,494
Look, I'm sorry you couldn't
save your universe,

1093
01:30:57,578 --> 01:31:00,122
but maybe you could help
to save mine.

1094
01:31:03,208 --> 01:31:05,085
Are you happy, Stephen?

1095
01:31:06,003 --> 01:31:07,046
What?

1096
01:31:07,671 --> 01:31:12,301
Are you happy, Stephen?

1097
01:31:14,219 --> 01:31:16,555
It's the question that...

1098
01:31:18,057 --> 01:31:19,725
Christine Palmer

1099
01:31:20,434 --> 01:31:22,186
asked me at her wedding.

1100
01:31:25,189 --> 01:31:27,691
I said, yes, of course I'm happy.

1101
01:31:27,858 --> 01:31:30,069
I'm a sorcerer with the power of gods.

1102
01:31:30,152 --> 01:31:32,946
What man wouldn't be happy?

1103
01:31:33,697 --> 01:31:38,869
And then I came back
to this goddamn haunted house,

1104
01:31:39,036 --> 01:31:40,454
sat down,

1105
01:31:42,122 --> 01:31:44,333
and wondered why I'd lied.

1106
01:31:46,627 --> 01:31:49,338
I never meant for any of this to happen.

1107
01:31:51,173 --> 01:31:54,176
I was looking for a world
where things were different.

1108
01:31:56,345 --> 01:31:59,848
Where I had Christine,
where I was happy.

1109
01:32:01,975 --> 01:32:03,435
But I didn't find it.

1110
01:32:05,062 --> 01:32:07,231
All I found were more of us.

1111
01:32:09,191 --> 01:32:11,568
So I did those Stephens a favour.

1112
01:32:13,195 --> 01:32:15,948
You ever had that dream
where you're falling

1113
01:32:16,031 --> 01:32:19,743
as if you've been pushed off
a tall building?

1114
01:32:22,788 --> 01:32:24,623
That was probably me.

1115
01:32:33,132 --> 01:32:35,718
The Darkhold exacts a heavy toll.

1116
01:32:35,884 --> 01:32:37,344
Okay.

1117
01:32:38,262 --> 01:32:40,848
All the more reason to give it a rest
and let me have it.

1118
01:32:41,014 --> 01:32:42,433
Here's the deal.

1119
01:32:42,599 --> 01:32:45,394
I'll let you use the Darkhold

1120
01:32:45,477 --> 01:32:47,396
if you give me your Christine.

1121
01:32:48,147 --> 01:32:49,440
Yeah.

1122
01:32:49,606 --> 01:32:51,608
I don't think she's gonna go for that.

1123
01:32:51,775 --> 01:32:52,776
No?

1124
01:32:52,985 --> 01:32:55,237
Didn't think so.

1125
01:36:23,195 --> 01:36:24,488
Hang on, we're coming.

1126
01:36:31,119 --> 01:36:32,871
What are you doing with the Darkhold?

1127
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:36,959
Are you going to Dreamwalk?

1128
01:36:37,125 --> 01:36:39,378
It's a little bit more
than just Dreamwalking.

1129
01:36:39,544 --> 01:36:41,838
All you Stranges, you're the same.

1130
01:36:42,005 --> 01:36:43,048
I know.

1131
01:36:45,133 --> 01:36:46,218
You're right.

1132
01:36:47,052 --> 01:36:48,387
We are all the same.

1133
01:36:49,429 --> 01:36:50,931
But right now, that kid needs me.

1134
01:36:51,014 --> 01:36:54,685
And I can't do any of this
without your help.

1135
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:56,645
While I'm under,

1136
01:36:56,728 --> 01:36:58,188
I need you to protect my body

1137
01:36:58,271 --> 01:37:00,273
in case they attack me for trespassing.

1138
01:37:00,607 --> 01:37:01,775
Who's they?

1139
01:37:03,485 --> 01:37:05,737
The souls of the damned.

1140
01:37:27,968 --> 01:37:28,969
Okay.

1141
01:37:29,136 --> 01:37:33,140
But doesn't a version of you
need to live in that universe,

1142
01:37:33,306 --> 01:37:35,100
so that you can Dreamwalk into them?

1143
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:38,395
Who said they had to be living?

1144
01:38:52,427 --> 01:38:54,221
Stephen Strange,

1145
01:38:54,387 --> 01:38:57,099
possessing a dead body is forbidden.

1146
01:38:57,265 --> 01:38:58,892
Forbidden.

1147
01:38:58,975 --> 01:39:00,477
Trespasser!

1148
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:02,104
Trespasser!

1149
01:39:03,522 --> 01:39:07,734
Cease your Dreamwalk,
or face the eternal consequences.

1150
01:39:16,618 --> 01:39:17,744
Stephen!

1151
01:39:18,411 --> 01:39:20,247
They're pulling me down.

1152
01:39:21,748 --> 01:39:22,958
Stephen!

1153
01:39:30,715 --> 01:39:32,217
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

1154
01:39:33,009 --> 01:39:34,010
Where are you?

1155
01:40:00,704 --> 01:40:02,622
The Brazier of Bom'Galiath.

1156
01:40:13,300 --> 01:40:14,301
Go back to hell.

1157
01:40:26,855 --> 01:40:28,064
Stephen.

1158
01:40:29,566 --> 01:40:30,859
I've got you.

1159
01:40:32,068 --> 01:40:34,446
You're a Master of the Mystic Arts.

1160
01:40:34,863 --> 01:40:36,323
They're spirits.

1161
01:40:36,406 --> 01:40:37,449
Use them.

1162
01:40:42,746 --> 01:40:43,747
Use them.

1163
01:40:46,166 --> 01:40:47,167
Use them.

1164
01:41:03,892 --> 01:41:05,185
No!

1165
01:41:59,114 --> 01:42:00,115
Come on!

1166
01:42:35,025 --> 01:42:37,235
Strange!

1167
01:42:45,660 --> 01:42:47,495
Dreamwalking. You hypocrite!

1168
01:42:54,252 --> 01:42:56,212
This time, it's gonna take
more than killing me

1169
01:42:56,296 --> 01:42:57,547
to kill me.

1170
01:43:05,889 --> 01:43:08,433
Murderer! Murderer!

1171
01:43:21,154 --> 01:43:22,906
I don't even wanna know.

1172
01:43:36,252 --> 01:43:38,254
No!

1173
01:43:38,338 --> 01:43:39,506
- No!
- No!

1174
01:43:39,589 --> 01:43:41,383
She's breaking free!

1175
01:43:41,549 --> 01:43:42,884
Hold her!

1176
01:43:43,051 --> 01:43:45,470
Strange, take America's power!

1177
01:43:51,309 --> 01:43:53,019
There's no other way.

1178
01:43:53,978 --> 01:43:54,979
Yeah.

1179
01:43:55,313 --> 01:43:56,773
This is the only way.

1180
01:44:09,869 --> 01:44:12,497
It's me in Other Me's body.

1181
01:44:16,251 --> 01:44:19,254
You're here to take my power,
aren't you?

1182
01:44:20,255 --> 01:44:21,756
Before Wanda can.

1183
01:44:23,675 --> 01:44:24,801
It's okay.

1184
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:27,137
I understand now.

1185
01:44:31,933 --> 01:44:34,144
No, America.

1186
01:44:34,853 --> 01:44:37,313
I've come here to tell you
to trust yourself.

1187
01:44:37,480 --> 01:44:39,065
Trust your power.

1188
01:44:39,232 --> 01:44:41,234
That's how we stop her.

1189
01:44:41,901 --> 01:44:43,486
I can't control it. I...

1190
01:44:43,570 --> 01:44:45,572
Yes, you can.

1191
01:44:45,738 --> 01:44:47,198
You have been all along.

1192
01:44:48,074 --> 01:44:49,993
Every time you opened a portal,

1193
01:44:50,076 --> 01:44:52,620
you sent us
exactly where we needed to go.

1194
01:44:54,456 --> 01:44:56,082
What about the first time?

1195
01:44:56,249 --> 01:44:58,751
Even that led you to this moment...

1196
01:45:00,753 --> 01:45:03,423
when you're gonna kick that witch's ass.

1197
01:45:25,987 --> 01:45:27,071
I've got you.

1198
01:46:17,121 --> 01:46:18,498
I can't beat you.

1199
01:46:20,542 --> 01:46:22,043
So I'll give you what you want.

1200
01:46:36,349 --> 01:46:38,434
Billy. Tommy.

1201
01:46:38,893 --> 01:46:41,229
Mommy!
It's the witch!

1202
01:46:41,312 --> 01:46:42,855
What have you done?

1203
01:46:43,106 --> 01:46:44,107
- Mom!
- Mommy!

1204
01:46:44,190 --> 01:46:45,400
Wait! Boys!

1205
01:46:45,483 --> 01:46:46,901
It's okay, it's okay. It's okay.

1206
01:46:47,068 --> 01:46:48,194
I'm your mother!

1207
01:46:50,613 --> 01:46:52,198
Get away from them.

1208
01:46:53,074 --> 01:46:54,742
Mom!

1209
01:46:55,201 --> 01:46:56,452
No.

1210
01:46:56,536 --> 01:46:57,579
Not yet.

1211
01:46:58,079 --> 01:46:59,289
Mommy!

1212
01:46:59,372 --> 01:47:01,207
- Get away from our mom!
- You're not our real mom!

1213
01:47:01,291 --> 01:47:03,042
Hey, boys. Stop. Please.

1214
01:47:03,126 --> 01:47:04,919
- Please. Boys, stop it.
- Get out of our house!

1215
01:47:05,003 --> 01:47:06,588
- You're not our mom!
- Get out!

1216
01:47:06,754 --> 01:47:07,964
- Go away!
- Go!

1217
01:47:08,047 --> 01:47:09,424
Stop it!

1218
01:47:17,724 --> 01:47:19,767
Please don't hurt us.

1219
01:47:20,143 --> 01:47:21,185
Please.

1220
01:47:22,145 --> 01:47:23,938
I would never hurt you.

1221
01:47:24,105 --> 01:47:25,106
Never.

1222
01:47:26,858 --> 01:47:29,068
I would never hurt anyone.

1223
01:47:29,235 --> 01:47:30,903
I'm not a monster.

1224
01:47:31,070 --> 01:47:32,322
I'm a...

1225
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:37,243
I'm...

1226
01:47:44,167 --> 01:47:46,377
I'm sorry.

1227
01:47:54,427 --> 01:47:55,511
Mom!

1228
01:47:55,678 --> 01:47:57,305
- Are you okay?
- Hi.

1229
01:47:58,264 --> 01:47:59,599
Hi. Okay.

1230
01:47:59,766 --> 01:48:00,767
I'm okay.

1231
01:48:01,643 --> 01:48:04,270
I'm okay. I'm okay.

1232
01:48:15,990 --> 01:48:17,950
- Mom, don't go. Don't go.
- No, Mom. Don't.

1233
01:48:18,034 --> 01:48:19,160
- It's okay.
- Mom.

1234
01:48:19,243 --> 01:48:21,037
It's okay. It's okay.

1235
01:49:01,994 --> 01:49:04,205
Know that they'll be loved.

1236
01:49:45,163 --> 01:49:46,164
What now?

1237
01:49:46,330 --> 01:49:47,665
Get out of here.

1238
01:49:48,416 --> 01:49:49,459
I'll find you.

1239
01:49:58,384 --> 01:50:00,136
We have to go. Now!

1240
01:50:12,607 --> 01:50:14,442
I opened the Darkhold.

1241
01:50:15,276 --> 01:50:17,445
I have to close it.

1242
01:50:20,239 --> 01:50:23,242
No one will ever be tempted
by the Darkhold again.

1243
01:51:07,995 --> 01:51:09,539
You all right?

1244
01:51:10,206 --> 01:51:11,833
- Is it over?
- Yeah.

1245
01:51:12,416 --> 01:51:13,751
Is America okay?

1246
01:51:13,835 --> 01:51:15,753
She's on her way here to get us.

1247
01:51:18,214 --> 01:51:19,215
Wanda?

1248
01:51:21,008 --> 01:51:22,009
No.

1249
01:51:30,434 --> 01:51:33,855
So she destroyed the Darkhold
in every universe.

1250
01:51:36,816 --> 01:51:38,401
She did the right thing.

1251
01:51:40,361 --> 01:51:41,362
Yeah, she did.

1252
01:51:49,328 --> 01:51:51,205
What's your universe like?

1253
01:51:53,249 --> 01:51:55,459
It's very beautiful.

1254
01:51:59,755 --> 01:52:01,424
I wish I could show you.

1255
01:52:05,511 --> 01:52:06,846
I'd really like that.

1256
01:52:11,934 --> 01:52:14,437
- But I have to go.
- Yeah.

1257
01:52:15,646 --> 01:52:16,898
Yeah, I know.

1258
01:52:20,651 --> 01:52:22,111
It's too bad though.

1259
01:52:24,363 --> 01:52:26,324
Could've been one hell of an Incursion.

1260
01:52:29,994 --> 01:52:31,203
I love you.

1261
01:52:34,290 --> 01:52:37,001
I love you in every universe.

1262
01:52:41,047 --> 01:52:42,798
It's not that
I don't wanna care for someone

1263
01:52:42,882 --> 01:52:44,342
or have someone care for me.

1264
01:52:44,508 --> 01:52:45,718
It's just...

1265
01:52:49,055 --> 01:52:50,431
I get scared.

1266
01:52:50,598 --> 01:52:51,599
Yeah.

1267
01:52:54,685 --> 01:52:56,103
Yeah.

1268
01:53:07,198 --> 01:53:08,407
Face your fears...

1269
01:53:11,160 --> 01:53:13,079
Doctor Strange.

1270
01:53:43,025 --> 01:53:45,152
How is this so much harder

1271
01:53:45,236 --> 01:53:46,779
than a Multiversal portal?

1272
01:53:48,948 --> 01:53:51,283
She needs to slow down
and be more patient.

1273
01:53:53,035 --> 01:53:55,121
Reminds me of another student I knew.

1274
01:53:57,623 --> 01:53:58,958
How you feeling?

1275
01:53:59,583 --> 01:54:00,584
Why do you ask?

1276
01:54:02,461 --> 01:54:05,506
You used the Darkhold
to Dreamwalk into your own corpse.

1277
01:54:06,841 --> 01:54:08,175
Yeah, right, that.

1278
01:54:09,176 --> 01:54:10,177
Fine.

1279
01:54:12,513 --> 01:54:14,306
But I do wanna ask you something.

1280
01:54:15,766 --> 01:54:17,226
Are you happy?

1281
01:54:18,644 --> 01:54:20,396
That's a...

1282
01:54:20,479 --> 01:54:21,689
interesting question.

1283
01:54:23,357 --> 01:54:26,110
You'd think that saving the world
would get you there,

1284
01:54:26,777 --> 01:54:27,987
but it doesn't.

1285
01:54:31,365 --> 01:54:35,453
Sometimes, I do wonder
about my other lives.

1286
01:54:36,829 --> 01:54:39,290
Yet I remain grateful in this one.

1287
01:54:40,291 --> 01:54:42,084
Even with its tribulations.

1288
01:54:44,086 --> 01:54:46,756
At least we don't have to
go through it alone, huh?

1289
01:54:46,922 --> 01:54:48,007
No, we don't.

1290
01:54:59,268 --> 01:55:01,145
Wait.

1291
01:55:03,481 --> 01:55:04,523
'Sup?

1292
01:55:04,690 --> 01:55:05,691
'Sup.

1293
01:55:07,318 --> 01:55:08,319
Made some sparks.

1294
01:55:08,944 --> 01:55:09,945
Great.

1295
01:55:10,571 --> 01:55:12,073
Your parents would be proud.

1296
01:55:12,156 --> 01:55:14,241
I hope you'll get to show 'em one day.

1297
01:55:15,367 --> 01:55:16,410
Stephen.

1298
01:55:21,040 --> 01:55:23,334
I'm glad I fell into your universe.

1299
01:55:25,294 --> 01:55:26,587
So am I, kid.

1300
01:55:28,255 --> 01:55:29,965
So am I.

1301
01:58:55,671 --> 01:58:57,006
Doctor Strange?

1302
01:59:00,426 --> 01:59:01,593
Can I help you?

1303
01:59:02,261 --> 01:59:03,721
You caused an Incursion,

1304
01:59:03,887 --> 01:59:05,514
and we're gonna fix it.

1305
01:59:14,189 --> 01:59:15,649
Unless you're afraid.

1306
01:59:20,529 --> 01:59:21,822
Not in the least.

1307
02:06:13,358 --> 02:06:14,568
It's over!
