1
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:26,229
<i>This is the Asgardian
refugee vessel Statesman.</i>

2
00:00:29,891 --> 00:00:33,539
<i>We are under assault. I
repeat, we are under assault.</i>

3
00:00:33,813 --> 00:00:36,578
<i>The engines are dead. Life support failing.</i>

4
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,821
<i>Requesting aid from any
vessel within range.</i>

5
00:00:40,845 --> 00:00:44,245
<i>We are 22 jump points
out of Asgard.</i>

6
00:00:44,555 --> 00:00:49,300
<i>Our crew is made up of Asgardian
families, we have very few soldiers here.</i>

7
00:00:49,301 --> 00:00:53,302
<i>This is not a warcraft, I
repeat, this is not a warcraft.</i>

8
00:01:06,365 --> 00:01:09,583
Hear me... and rejoice.

9
00:01:13,169 --> 00:01:15,371
You have had the privilege

10
00:01:15,571 --> 00:01:18,450
of being saved
by the Great Titan.

11
00:01:21,143 --> 00:01:23,697
You may think this is suffering.

12
00:01:24,581 --> 00:01:26,102
No.

13
00:01:26,302 --> 00:01:28,855
It is salvation.

14
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:34,963
The universal scales

15
00:01:35,163 --> 00:01:38,750
tip toward balance
because of your sacrifice.

16
00:01:40,165 --> 00:01:41,592
Smile.

17
00:01:41,792 --> 00:01:44,436
For even in death

18
00:01:44,736 --> 00:01:47,673
you have become
Children of Thanos.

19
00:02:02,674 --> 00:02:05,579
I know what it's like to lose.

20
00:02:06,615 --> 00:02:10,531
To feel so desperately
that you're right,

21
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:13,179
yet to fail nonetheless.

22
00:02:21,178 --> 00:02:23,306
As lightning

23
00:02:23,506 --> 00:02:26,524
turns the legs to jelly.

24
00:02:28,601 --> 00:02:31,655
I ask you
to what end?

25
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:35,491
Dread it, run from it...

26
00:02:35,753 --> 00:02:38,315
Destiny arrives all the same.

27
00:02:39,378 --> 00:02:41,344
And now, it's here.

28
00:02:41,654 --> 00:02:43,620
Or should I say...

29
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,651
I am.

30
00:02:51,789 --> 00:02:53,984
You talk too much.

31
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:56,156
The Tesseract.

32
00:02:56,356 --> 00:02:58,843
Or, your brother's head.

33
00:03:03,256 --> 00:03:05,498
I assume you have a preference?

34
00:03:06,638 --> 00:03:08,263
Oh, I do.

35
00:03:10,685 --> 00:03:12,020
Kill away.

36
00:03:26,867 --> 00:03:28,515
All right, stop!

37
00:03:31,632 --> 00:03:35,842
We don't have the Tesseract.
It was destroyed on Asgard.

38
00:03:47,366 --> 00:03:50,022
You really are the worst, brother.

39
00:03:54,195 --> 00:03:58,554
I assure you, brother. The
sun will shine on us again.

40
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:03,437
Your optimism is
misplaced, Asgardian.

41
00:04:03,491 --> 00:04:07,748
Well, for one thing,
I'm not Asgardian.

42
00:04:07,822 --> 00:04:09,260
And for another...

43
00:04:10,808 --> 00:04:12,792
we have the Hulk.

44
00:04:24,672 --> 00:04:26,570
Let him have his fun.

45
00:05:18,467 --> 00:05:20,217
Forefathers...

46
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:26,641
Let the dark magic, flow
through me one last... time.

47
00:05:41,786 --> 00:05:43,700
That was a mistake.

48
00:05:49,118 --> 00:05:50,391
No!

49
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:02,980
You are going to die for that!

50
00:06:13,893 --> 00:06:16,299
My humble personage...

51
00:06:17,151 --> 00:06:20,940
bows before your grandeur.

52
00:06:22,612 --> 00:06:25,879
No other being has
ever had the might,

53
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:27,948
nay, the nobility,

54
00:06:28,593 --> 00:06:33,588
to wield not one,
but two Infinity Stones.

55
00:06:36,418 --> 00:06:38,180
The Universe,

56
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,496
lies within your grasp.

57
00:07:20,163 --> 00:07:23,850
There are two more
Stones on Earth.

58
00:07:24,373 --> 00:07:28,145
Find them, my Children, and
bring them to me on Titan.

59
00:07:28,177 --> 00:07:32,372
- Father, we will not fail you.
- If I might, interject...

60
00:07:32,404 --> 00:07:33,857
If you're going to Earth,

61
00:07:34,024 --> 00:07:36,482
you might want a guide.

62
00:07:36,483 --> 00:07:39,202
I do have a bit of
experience in that arena.

63
00:07:39,249 --> 00:07:41,686
If you consider failure experience.

64
00:07:41,886 --> 00:07:44,389
I consider experience, experience.

65
00:07:45,686 --> 00:07:47,357
Almighty Thanos.

66
00:07:47,636 --> 00:07:52,624
I, Loki, Prince of Asgard...

67
00:07:55,944 --> 00:07:58,217
Odin-son...

68
00:08:01,092 --> 00:08:03,468
The rightful king of Jotunheim,

69
00:08:03,732 --> 00:08:06,256
God of Mischief...

70
00:08:06,303 --> 00:08:08,554
Do hereby pledge to you,

71
00:08:09,253 --> 00:08:13,114
my undying fidelity.

72
00:08:23,988 --> 00:08:25,894
"Undying"?

73
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:32,261
You should choose your
words more carefully.

74
00:08:52,995 --> 00:08:54,159
You...

75
00:08:55,136 --> 00:08:57,854
will never be...

76
00:08:59,417 --> 00:09:00,979
a god.

77
00:09:26,763 --> 00:09:29,966
No resurrections this time.

78
00:09:52,704 --> 00:09:55,524
No... Loki...

79
00:10:33,932 --> 00:10:36,955
Seriously? You don't
have any money?

80
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:40,284
Attachment to the material is
detachment from the spiritual.

81
00:10:40,309 --> 00:10:41,668
I'll tell the guys at the deli.

82
00:10:41,704 --> 00:10:44,269
Maybe they'll make you a
metaphysical ham on rye.

83
00:10:44,294 --> 00:10:46,806
- Wait, wait. I think I have 200.
- Dollars?

84
00:10:46,831 --> 00:10:48,777
- Rupees.
- Which is?

85
00:10:48,803 --> 00:10:52,103
- Uh, a buck and a half.
- What do you want?

86
00:10:52,256 --> 00:10:54,646
I wouldn't say no
to a tuna melt.

87
00:11:06,848 --> 00:11:08,598
Thanos is coming.

88
00:11:09,176 --> 00:11:10,777
He's coming.

89
00:11:14,868 --> 00:11:15,994
Who?

90
00:11:25,299 --> 00:11:27,002
- Slow down and I'll spell it out for you.
- You're totally rambling.

91
00:11:27,027 --> 00:11:28,292
- No, I'm not.
- You lost me.

92
00:11:28,316 --> 00:11:31,161
- Look, you know how you're having a dream,
and in the dream you gotta pee? - Yeah.

93
00:11:31,238 --> 00:11:33,693
Okay, and then you're like, Oh my God,
there's no bathrooms, what am I gonna do?

94
00:11:33,718 --> 00:11:35,847
- Right. - Oh, Someone's watching!
I'm gonna go in my pants, and...

95
00:11:35,871 --> 00:11:38,842
And then you wake up, and in
real life you actually have to pee.

96
00:11:38,867 --> 00:11:40,207
- Yes.
- Yeah.

97
00:11:40,234 --> 00:11:41,291
Everybody has that.

98
00:11:41,303 --> 00:11:43,695
Right. That's the point
I'm trying to make.

99
00:11:43,711 --> 00:11:47,538
Apropos of that. Last night,
I dreamt, we had a kid.

100
00:11:47,758 --> 00:11:49,157
It was so real.

101
00:11:49,357 --> 00:11:51,226
We named him after
your eccentric uncle, uh,

102
00:11:51,258 --> 00:11:54,226
- What was his name? - Right.
- Morgan. Morgan.

103
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:58,134
- So you woke up, and...
- Naturally. - ...thought that we were...

104
00:11:58,159 --> 00:11:59,409
- Expecting.
- Yeah.

105
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:00,324
- Yes?
- No.

106
00:12:00,349 --> 00:12:03,802
- I had a dream about it. It was so real.
- If you wanted to have a kid...

107
00:12:03,841 --> 00:12:05,870
You wouldn't have done that.

108
00:12:05,895 --> 00:12:07,100
I'm glad you brought this up

109
00:12:07,177 --> 00:12:09,809
cause it's nothing, it's
just a housing unit for nano-parts.

110
00:12:09,834 --> 00:12:12,532
- You're just not helping your case. OK?
- It's just an attachment. It's not a...

111
00:12:12,556 --> 00:12:15,141
- You don't need that.
- I know, I had the surgery.

112
00:12:15,165 --> 00:12:18,214
I'm just trying to protect us, and
the future us-es, and that's it.

113
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:20,926
Just in case there's a monster in
the closet. Instead of, you know...

114
00:12:20,957 --> 00:12:22,544
Shirts.

115
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:25,363
You know me so well.

116
00:12:25,762 --> 00:12:27,617
You finish all my sentences.

117
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:30,738
You should have shirts
in your closet.

118
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:33,537
Yeah. You know what
there should be?

119
00:12:33,562 --> 00:12:36,176
No more surprises. We're gonna
have a nice dinner tonight.

120
00:12:36,178 --> 00:12:38,578
Show off this Harry Win-stone.
Right?

121
00:12:38,749 --> 00:12:41,758
And we should have no more surprises.
Ever. I should promise you.

122
00:12:41,783 --> 00:12:43,439
- Yeah.
- I will.

123
00:12:45,283 --> 00:12:46,118
I think you...

124
00:12:46,142 --> 00:12:49,317
Tony Stark,
I'm Dr. Stephen Strange.

125
00:12:49,517 --> 00:12:51,899
I need you to come with me.

126
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:55,664
Oh, uh. Congratulations on
the wedding, by the way.

127
00:12:55,689 --> 00:12:57,747
I'm sorry, are you giving
out tickets or something?

128
00:12:57,757 --> 00:12:59,073
We need your help.

129
00:12:59,657 --> 00:13:03,117
Look, it's not overselling it to say that
the fate of the Universe is at stake.

130
00:13:03,134 --> 00:13:05,672
And who's "we"?

131
00:13:06,258 --> 00:13:08,841
- Hey, Tony.
- Bruce!

132
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,147
- Pepper.
- Hi.

133
00:13:13,266 --> 00:13:15,484
You okay?

134
00:13:16,577 --> 00:13:18,627
At the dawn of the Universe,

135
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:22,483
there was nothing.
Then, boom!

136
00:13:23,107 --> 00:13:26,553
The Big Bang sends
six elemental crystals,

137
00:13:26,753 --> 00:13:29,706
hurtling across the virgin Universe.

138
00:13:30,628 --> 00:13:32,102
These Infinity Stones

139
00:13:32,202 --> 00:13:35,095
each control an essential
aspect of existence.

140
00:13:36,097 --> 00:13:37,596
Space.

141
00:13:38,448 --> 00:13:40,135
Reality.

142
00:13:41,189 --> 00:13:42,759
Power.

143
00:13:43,369 --> 00:13:44,962
Soul.

144
00:13:45,846 --> 00:13:47,580
Mind.

145
00:13:48,979 --> 00:13:50,986
And Time.

146
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:02,491
- Tell me his name again.
- Thanos.

147
00:14:02,531 --> 00:14:05,945
He's a plague, Tony. He invades planets.
He takes what he wants.

148
00:14:05,969 --> 00:14:09,851
He wipes out half the population.
He sent Loki.

149
00:14:10,609 --> 00:14:13,281
The attack on New York. That's him.

150
00:14:13,624 --> 00:14:15,624
This is it.

151
00:14:16,426 --> 00:14:18,285
- What's our time line?
- No telling.

152
00:14:18,293 --> 00:14:19,960
He has the Power and Space Stones,

153
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,636
that already makes him the strongest
creature in the whole Universe.

154
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:25,560
If he gets his hands on
all six Stones, Tony...

155
00:14:25,585 --> 00:14:29,466
He could destroy life on a scale
hitherto undreamt of.

156
00:14:29,491 --> 00:14:31,342
Did you seriously just say
"hitherto undreamt of"?

157
00:14:31,366 --> 00:14:33,699
Are you seriously leaning on
the Cauldron of the Cosmos?

158
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:34,810
Is that what that is?

159
00:14:37,718 --> 00:14:39,757
I'm going to allow that.

160
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:42,980
If Thanos needs all six,

161
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,113
why don't we just stick this
one down the garbage disposal?

162
00:14:45,213 --> 00:14:46,248
No can do.

163
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,325
We swore an oath to protect
the Time Stone with our lives.

164
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:52,700
And I swore off dairy, but then Ben &
Jerry's named a flavor after me, so...

165
00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:54,488
- Stark Raving Hazelnuts.
- It's not bad.

166
00:14:54,513 --> 00:14:55,764
A bit chalky.

167
00:14:55,964 --> 00:14:57,763
"A Hunka-Hulka Burning
Fudge" is our favorite.

168
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:00,450
- That's a thing?
- Whatever. Point is, things change.

169
00:15:00,459 --> 00:15:03,131
Our oath to protect the
Time Stone cannot change.

170
00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:05,346
This Stone may be the best
chance we have against Thanos.

171
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:08,405
Yeah, so, conversely, it may also be
his best chance against us!

172
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:10,075
Only if we don't do our jobs.

173
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,225
What is your job exactly,
besides making balloon animals?

174
00:15:13,581 --> 00:15:16,353
Protecting your
reality, douche bag.

175
00:15:16,378 --> 00:15:19,518
Okay guys, can we, can we table
this discussion right now?

176
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:22,917
The fact is, is that we have this stone.
We know where it is.

177
00:15:22,934 --> 00:15:25,402
Vision is out there somewhere
with the Mind Stone.

178
00:15:25,405 --> 00:15:27,434
And we have to find him now.

179
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:30,527
- Yeah, that's the thing.
- What do you mean?

180
00:15:30,551 --> 00:15:33,988
Two weeks ago, Vision turned off
his transponder. He's offline.

181
00:15:33,997 --> 00:15:35,176
What?

182
00:15:35,349 --> 00:15:38,972
- Tony, you lost another super bot?
- I didn't lose him. He's more than that.

183
00:15:38,997 --> 00:15:41,895
- He's evolving.
- Who could find Vision, then?

184
00:15:46,119 --> 00:15:48,720
- Probably Steve Rogers.
- Oh, great.

185
00:15:48,744 --> 00:15:51,517
Maybe. But...

186
00:15:55,057 --> 00:15:56,682
Call him.

187
00:15:56,877 --> 00:15:58,642
It's not that easy.

188
00:15:59,182 --> 00:16:01,559
- God, we haven't caught up in a spell,
have we?  - No.

189
00:16:02,266 --> 00:16:04,573
The Avengers broke up.
We're toast.

190
00:16:04,721 --> 00:16:06,314
Broke up?

191
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:12,080
- Like a band? Like The Beatles?
- Cap and I fell out hard.

192
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:14,908
We're not on speaking terms.

193
00:16:15,401 --> 00:16:18,205
Tony, listen to me.

194
00:16:18,909 --> 00:16:21,236
Thor's gone.

195
00:16:21,971 --> 00:16:25,791
Thanos is coming. It doesn't matter
who you're talking to or not.

196
00:16:44,758 --> 00:16:45,758
It's...

197
00:17:04,021 --> 00:17:07,505
Say, Doc, you wouldn't happen to
be moving your hair, would you?

198
00:17:07,598 --> 00:17:10,020
Not at the moment, no.

199
00:17:42,154 --> 00:17:43,614
You okay?

200
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,107
- Help him. Wong, Doc.
- Got it.

201
00:17:48,132 --> 00:17:51,139
- Friday, what am I looking at?
- Not sure. I'm working on it.

202
00:17:51,164 --> 00:17:54,585
Hey! You better not have put that Time
Stone in your back pocket, Doc!

203
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,507
I might wanna use it.

204
00:18:23,008 --> 00:18:25,727
Ned, hey. I need you
to cause a distraction.

205
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:27,047
Holy shit!

206
00:18:27,117 --> 00:18:31,577
We're all gonna die!
There's a spaceship!

207
00:18:39,928 --> 00:18:41,480
What's the matter with you kids?

208
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:44,029
You never seen a spaceship before?

209
00:18:55,485 --> 00:18:59,531
Friday, evac anyone south of 43rd
Street. Notify first responders.

210
00:18:59,547 --> 00:19:00,711
Will do.

211
00:19:28,765 --> 00:19:32,202
Hear me, and rejoice!

212
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:37,359
- You are about to die at the hands
of the Children of Thanos. - Us.

213
00:19:37,663 --> 00:19:42,280
Be thankful, that your meaningless
lives are now contributing to the balance...

214
00:19:42,296 --> 00:19:45,327
I'm sorry, Earth is closed today.

215
00:19:45,343 --> 00:19:48,174
You better pack it up
and get outta here.

216
00:19:48,274 --> 00:19:49,686
Stone keeper...

217
00:19:50,077 --> 00:19:52,399
Does this chattering
animal speak for you?

218
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:54,355
Certainly not. I speak for myself.

219
00:19:54,633 --> 00:19:57,884
You're trespassing in
this city and on this planet.

220
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:01,302
- That means get lost, Squidward!
- They exhaust me.

221
00:20:01,372 --> 00:20:04,476
- ([I can tell.])
- Bring me the Stone.
- ([Yes I will.])

222
00:20:04,713 --> 00:20:06,767
Banner, you want a piece?

223
00:20:07,509 --> 00:20:10,748
No, not really. But when
do I ever get what I want.

224
00:20:10,755 --> 00:20:12,155
That's right.

225
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:16,766
Been a while. It's gonna be
good to have you, buddy.

226
00:20:17,233 --> 00:20:20,617
Shh. I just... I need to
concentrate here for a second.

227
00:20:20,642 --> 00:20:22,600
Come on, come on, (Max).

228
00:20:25,269 --> 00:20:27,479
Where's your guy?

229
00:20:27,949 --> 00:20:29,722
I don't know. We've sorta
been having a thing.

230
00:20:29,747 --> 00:20:33,372
- There's no time for a thing. - I know.
- That's the thing right there. Let's go.

231
00:20:39,052 --> 00:20:42,170
- Dude, you're embarrassing me
in front of the wizards. - I'm sorry.

232
00:20:42,202 --> 00:20:44,670
- I can't...or he won't...I don't...
- It's okay. Stand down.

233
00:20:44,695 --> 00:20:46,937
- Keep an eye on him? Thank you.
- I have him.

234
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:19,999
- Where'd that come from?
- It's nano-tech, you like it? A little something I...

235
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:26,341
Dr. Banner, if the rest of your
green friend won't be joining us...

236
00:21:35,589 --> 00:21:38,698
- You gotta get that Stone outta here, now.
- It stays with me.

237
00:21:38,723 --> 00:21:40,355
Exactly. Bye!

238
00:21:49,326 --> 00:21:52,122
Tony, you okay? How we doing?
Good, bad?

239
00:21:52,147 --> 00:21:54,428
Really, really good.  Really good.
Do you plan on helping out?

240
00:21:54,428 --> 00:21:56,341
I'm trying. He won't come out.

241
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:57,990
Hang on!

242
00:22:05,997 --> 00:22:08,880
Come on, Hulk. What
are you doing to me?

243
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:11,325
Come out. Come out! Come out!

244
00:22:11,356 --> 00:22:13,793
No!

245
00:22:17,356 --> 00:22:20,270
What do you mean, "no"?

246
00:22:25,005 --> 00:22:28,153
- Hey, man! What's up, Mr. Stark?
- Kid, where'd you come from?

247
00:22:28,177 --> 00:22:30,372
The field trip.  (Yer Moma!)

248
00:22:31,357 --> 00:22:34,062
Uh, what is this guy's
problem, Mr. Stark?

249
00:22:34,087 --> 00:22:37,688
Uh, he's from space. He came here to
steal a necklace from a wizard.

250
00:22:39,137 --> 00:22:40,537
Oh, yeah?

251
00:23:03,838 --> 00:23:08,533
Your powers are quaint. You
must be popular with children.

252
00:23:10,361 --> 00:23:13,039
It's a simple spell
but quite unbreakable.

253
00:23:13,051 --> 00:23:15,262
Then I'll take it
off your corpse.

254
00:23:27,297 --> 00:23:33,078
You'll find...removing...a dead
man's spell...is troublesome.

255
00:23:33,094 --> 00:23:35,476
You'll only wish you were dead.

256
00:23:45,095 --> 00:23:46,517
No!

257
00:23:49,892 --> 00:23:52,485
- Kid, that's the wizard. Get on it.
- On it!

258
00:24:00,628 --> 00:24:02,187
Not cool.

259
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:07,130
Gotcha!

260
00:24:08,354 --> 00:24:09,354
Hey!

261
00:24:17,121 --> 00:24:22,011
- Uh, Mr. Stark? I'm being beamed up.
- Hang on, kid.

262
00:24:41,136 --> 00:24:43,964
Wong, you're invited
to my wedding.

263
00:24:50,577 --> 00:24:52,725
Give me a little juice, Friday.

264
00:25:00,641 --> 00:25:02,820
Unlock 17-A.

265
00:25:15,045 --> 00:25:17,677
Pete, you gotta let go.
I'm gonna catch you.

266
00:25:17,689 --> 00:25:19,529
But you said save the wizard!

267
00:25:19,576 --> 00:25:21,350
I can't breathe!

268
00:25:21,375 --> 00:25:24,115
We're too high up. You're
running out of air.

269
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,536
That makes sense.

270
00:25:43,644 --> 00:25:45,920
Mr. Stark, it smells
like a new car in here.

271
00:25:45,945 --> 00:25:49,218
- Happy trails, kid. Friday, send him home.
- Yup.

272
00:25:49,226 --> 00:25:50,835
Oh, come on!

273
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:01,055
Boss, incoming call
from Miss Potts.

274
00:26:01,081 --> 00:26:03,581
Tony? Oh, my God. Are you all right?
What's going on?

275
00:26:03,606 --> 00:26:06,612
Yeah, I'm fine. I just think we
might have to push our 8:30 res.

276
00:26:06,628 --> 00:26:07,731
Why?

277
00:26:07,743 --> 00:26:11,088
Just 'cause I'll probably
not make it back for awhile.

278
00:26:11,511 --> 00:26:13,893
- Tell me you're not on that ship.
- Yeah.

279
00:26:13,918 --> 00:26:16,243
God, no. Please tell me
you're not on that ship.

280
00:26:16,255 --> 00:26:17,675
Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

281
00:26:17,691 --> 00:26:19,138
I don't know how to say this. Pep...

282
00:26:19,238 --> 00:26:21,066
Come back here, Tony. I swear to God...
Come back here right now!

283
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,354
Come back!

284
00:26:23,355 --> 00:26:27,901
Boss, we're losing her.
I'm going, too...

285
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:38,675
Oh, my God.

286
00:26:42,082 --> 00:26:44,887
I should have stayed on the bus.

287
00:26:58,373 --> 00:27:01,802
- Where you going?
- The Time Stone's been taken.

288
00:27:01,827 --> 00:27:04,117
The Sanctum remains unguarded.

289
00:27:04,317 --> 00:27:05,615
What will you do?

290
00:27:06,307 --> 00:27:09,228
I'm gonna make a call.

291
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:33,884
Got his feet to movin'

292
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:35,752
and that rubberband off the ground

293
00:27:36,141 --> 00:27:38,641
He lifted it way up high, ha

294
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,287
In the sky, 'y'all

295
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,550
And then he

296
00:27:42,213 --> 00:27:43,480
Oh get with it, y’all

297
00:27:43,643 --> 00:27:47,443
Hey, y’all prepare yourself
for The Rubberband...yeaaah

298
00:27:48,348 --> 00:27:50,394
Sing it, Drax!

299
00:27:53,744 --> 00:27:57,944
You’re bound to lose control when
The Rubberband starts to jam

300
00:28:02,206 --> 00:28:03,760
Why are we doing this again?

301
00:28:03,785 --> 00:28:06,480
It's a distress signal, Rocket.
Someone could be dying.

302
00:28:06,505 --> 00:28:10,488
- I get that, but why are we doing it?
- 'Cause we're nice.

303
00:28:10,652 --> 00:28:13,436
And maybe whoever it is will give us a
little cheddar cheese for our help...

304
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:17,051
- Which isn't the point.
- Which isn't the point... I mean...

305
00:28:17,076 --> 00:28:19,211
- If he doesn't pony up...
- We'll take his ship.

306
00:28:19,236 --> 00:28:23,185
- Exactly!
- B-b-b-bingo!
- Alright!

307
00:28:25,231 --> 00:28:27,364
We are arriving.

308
00:28:27,389 --> 00:28:29,855
All right, Guardians.
Don't forget, this might

309
00:28:29,867 --> 00:28:32,293
be dangerous, so let's
put on our mean faces.

310
00:28:37,072 --> 00:28:40,888
Groot, put that thing away. Now.
I don't wanna tell you again. Groot.

311
00:28:40,897 --> 00:28:42,568
I am Groot!

312
00:28:42,592 --> 00:28:44,873
- Whoa! Language!
- Hey! - Wow!

313
00:28:44,898 --> 00:28:46,717
You got some acorns on you, kid.

314
00:28:46,742 --> 00:28:50,226
Ever since you got little
sap, you're a total d-hole.

315
00:28:50,258 --> 00:28:53,961
Keep it up, and I'm gonna
smash that thing to pieces!

316
00:29:00,703 --> 00:29:03,406
What happened?

317
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:08,449
Oh, my God.

318
00:29:13,371 --> 00:29:15,902
Looks like we're
not getting paid.

319
00:29:17,613 --> 00:29:20,956
Wipers! Wipers! Get it off.

320
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,334
How the hell is this
dude still alive?

321
00:29:30,358 --> 00:29:33,983
He is not a dude. You're a dude.

322
00:29:34,085 --> 00:29:37,600
This... This is a man.

323
00:29:37,671 --> 00:29:41,296
- A handsome, muscular man.
- I'm muscular.

324
00:29:41,304 --> 00:29:44,296
Who are you kidding, Quill? You're
one sandwich away from fat.

325
00:29:44,304 --> 00:29:48,373
- Yeah, right. What?
- It's true. You have a little weight...

326
00:29:49,991 --> 00:29:52,334
Gamora, do you think I'm...

327
00:29:54,483 --> 00:29:57,438
He is anxious. Angry.

328
00:29:57,638 --> 00:30:01,584
He feels tremendous
loss and guilt.

329
00:30:01,774 --> 00:30:04,766
It's like a pirate had
a baby with an angel.

330
00:30:04,791 --> 00:30:07,557
Wow. This is a real wake-up
call for me. Okay.

331
00:30:07,582 --> 00:30:08,827
I'm gonna get a Bowflex.

332
00:30:09,051 --> 00:30:11,536
I'm gonna commit.
I'm gonna get some dumbbells.

333
00:30:11,632 --> 00:30:13,192
You know you can't eat
dumbbells, right?

334
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:17,080
It's like his muscles are
made of Cotati metal fiber.

335
00:30:17,092 --> 00:30:19,106
Stop massaging his muscles.

336
00:30:20,394 --> 00:30:22,229
Wake him up.

337
00:30:24,217 --> 00:30:25,460
Wake.

338
00:30:42,862 --> 00:30:45,502
Who the hell are you guys?

339
00:30:47,768 --> 00:30:51,635
The entire time I knew Thanos,
he only ever had one goal:

340
00:30:51,643 --> 00:30:55,439
To bring balance to the Universe
by wiping out half of all life.

341
00:30:55,837 --> 00:31:00,518
He used to kill people planet by
planet, massacre by massacre.

342
00:31:00,534 --> 00:31:03,601
- Including my own.
- If he gets all six Infinity Stones,

343
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,546
he can do it with the snap
of his fingers, like this.

344
00:31:06,863 --> 00:31:10,905
You seem to know a
great deal about Thanos.

345
00:31:10,917 --> 00:31:14,355
Gamora... is the
daughter of Thanos.

346
00:31:17,513 --> 00:31:20,926
- Your father killed my brother.
- Oh, boy.

347
00:31:20,927 --> 00:31:25,591
Stepfather, technically.  She
hates him as much as you do.

348
00:31:28,217 --> 00:31:29,546
Families can be tough.

349
00:31:29,746 --> 00:31:33,467
Well, before my father died,
he told me that I had a half-sister...

350
00:31:33,492 --> 00:31:36,619
that he imprisoned in Hel.
Then she returned

351
00:31:36,631 --> 00:31:40,280
home, and stabbed me in the eye,
so... I had to kill her.

352
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,283
There's life, there was nothingness.

353
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,067
Round and round and...

354
00:31:44,852 --> 00:31:48,236
- I feel your pain.
- I feel your pain, as well.

355
00:31:48,261 --> 00:31:50,816
Because, I mean it's not a competition,
but I've been through a lot.

356
00:31:50,841 --> 00:31:55,872
My father killed my mother, and then I had
to kill my father. And that was hard.

357
00:31:55,888 --> 00:31:58,836
Probably even harder than
having to kill a sister.

358
00:31:58,861 --> 00:32:02,095
Plus, I, came out
with both of my eyes.

359
00:32:02,111 --> 00:32:04,868
I need a hammer, not a spoon.

360
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:06,811
How do I open this thing?

361
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:10,893
Is there some sort of a
four-digit code maybe...

362
00:32:11,093 --> 00:32:13,940
- Like a birth date or something...
- What are you doing?

363
00:32:13,941 --> 00:32:15,188
Taking your pod.

364
00:32:15,284 --> 00:32:18,888
Ahem.  No, you're not!

365
00:32:19,602 --> 00:32:24,562
You will not be taking
our pod today, sir.

366
00:32:25,094 --> 00:32:28,209
Quill. Are you making your voice deeper?

367
00:32:29,777 --> 00:32:31,158
- No.
- You are.

368
00:32:31,358 --> 00:32:34,127
You're imitating the god-man.
It's weird.

369
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:36,462
- No I'm not.
- He just did it again!

370
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:39,441
This is my voice!

371
00:32:43,523 --> 00:32:46,726
- Are you mocking me?
- Are you mocking me?

372
00:32:46,751 --> 00:32:48,829
Please just stop.
Just don't do it again.

373
00:32:48,876 --> 00:32:51,122
- He's trying to copy me.
- Yeah, just stop doing that.

374
00:32:51,147 --> 00:32:54,205
- Enough! - He's doing it first.
- We need to stop Thanos.

375
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:57,125
Which means we need to find
out where he's going next.

376
00:32:57,137 --> 00:32:58,157
Knowhere.

377
00:32:58,338 --> 00:33:02,923
- He must be going somewhere.
- No, no. Knowhere? It's a place.

378
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,597
We've been there. It sucks.

379
00:33:04,797 --> 00:33:06,455
Excuse me, that's our food.

380
00:33:06,471 --> 00:33:08,760
- Not anymore.
- Thor...

381
00:33:08,785 --> 00:33:11,337
Why would he go to Knowhere?

382
00:33:11,362 --> 00:33:14,209
Because for years, the
Reality Stone has been safely stored

383
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:16,480
there with a man
called the Collector.

384
00:33:16,704 --> 00:33:18,459
If it's with the Collector,
then it's not safe.

385
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:20,284
Only an idiot would
give that man a stone.

386
00:33:20,327 --> 00:33:21,336
Or a genius.

387
00:33:21,436 --> 00:33:24,147
How do you know he's not going
for one of the other stones?

388
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:27,108
There're six stones out there.

389
00:33:27,124 --> 00:33:30,968
Thanos already has the Power Stone
because he stole it last week,

390
00:33:30,993 --> 00:33:32,912
when he decimated Xandar.

391
00:33:33,112 --> 00:33:35,237
He stole the Space Stone from me.

392
00:33:35,252 --> 00:33:38,197
When he destroyed my ship and
slaughtered half my people.

393
00:33:38,222 --> 00:33:41,206
The Time and Mind Stones are safe on Earth.
They're with the Avengers.

394
00:33:41,231 --> 00:33:43,552
- The Avengers?
- The Earth's Mightiest Heroes.

395
00:33:43,577 --> 00:33:46,554
- Like Kevin Bacon?
- He may be on the team. I don't know.

396
00:33:46,754 --> 00:33:47,786
I haven't been there in a while.

397
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,077
As for the Soul Stone, well
no one's ever seen that.

398
00:33:50,277 --> 00:33:51,582
No one even knows where it is.

399
00:33:51,653 --> 00:33:55,160
Therefore, Thanos can't get it.
Therefore, he's going to Knowhere.

400
00:33:55,169 --> 00:33:58,582
Hence, he'll be getting the Reality Stone.
You're welcome.

401
00:33:58,598 --> 00:34:01,613
- Then we have to go to Knowhere now.
- Wrong.

402
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:05,224
- Where we have to go, is Nivadellir.
- That's a made up word.

403
00:34:05,249 --> 00:34:09,288
- Oh what's made up?
- Nidavellir is real? Seriously?

404
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:12,371
I mean, that place is a legend. They
make the most powerful,

405
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,788
horrific weapons to ever
torment the Universe.

406
00:34:14,813 --> 00:34:16,963
I would very much like
to go there, please.

407
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:19,243
The rabbit is correct, and
clearly the smartest one.

408
00:34:19,663 --> 00:34:20,564
Rabbit?

409
00:34:20,587 --> 00:34:23,097
Only Eitri the dwarf king can
make me the weapon I need.

410
00:34:23,121 --> 00:34:25,539
- I assume you're the captain, sir?
- You're very perceptive.

411
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:28,782
You seem like a noble leader. Will you
join me on my quest to Nivadellir?

412
00:34:28,807 --> 00:34:32,585
Lemme just ask the captain. Oh wait a
second, it's me! Yeah, I'll go.

413
00:34:32,785 --> 00:34:35,228
- Wonderful.
- Except that I'm the captain.

414
00:34:35,253 --> 00:34:36,784
- Quiet!
- And that's my backpack.

415
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:39,385
- Go sit down.
- Look, this is my ship.

416
00:34:39,401 --> 00:34:41,119
And I'm not going to...

417
00:34:42,111 --> 00:34:44,525
Wait, what kind of weapon
are we talking about here?

418
00:34:44,534 --> 00:34:46,541
The Thanos killing kind.

419
00:34:46,566 --> 00:34:48,412
Don't you think that we should
all have a weapon like that?

420
00:34:48,436 --> 00:34:50,607
No. You simply lack the
strength to wield them.

421
00:34:50,624 --> 00:34:53,167
Your bodies would crumble as your
minds collapsed into madness.

422
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:55,076
Is it weird that I wanna
do it even more now?

423
00:34:55,088 --> 00:34:56,211
A little bit. Yeah.

424
00:34:56,411 --> 00:34:59,060
If we don't go to Knowhere and
Thanos retrieves another stone,

425
00:34:59,084 --> 00:35:01,630
- he'll be too powerful to stop.
- He already is.

426
00:35:01,654 --> 00:35:03,441
I got it figured out.

427
00:35:03,466 --> 00:35:06,958
We got two ships, and a
large assortment of morons.

428
00:35:06,975 --> 00:35:09,282
So me and Groot will go
with the pirate-angel here,

429
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:12,627
and the morons will go to
Knowhere to try to stop Thanos.

430
00:35:12,955 --> 00:35:15,221
- Cool? Cool.
- So cool.

431
00:35:15,245 --> 00:35:16,994
For the record...

432
00:35:17,041 --> 00:35:19,714
I know that you're only going with
him because it's where Thanos isn't.

433
00:35:19,738 --> 00:35:24,089
You know, you really shouldn't talk
that way to your captain, Quill.

434
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,299
Come on, Groot.

435
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,956
Put that game down.
You'll rot your brain.

436
00:35:33,279 --> 00:35:36,857
I bid you farewell and
good luck, morons. Bye.

437
00:35:51,573 --> 00:35:52,706
Vis?

438
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:55,008
Is it the stone again?

439
00:35:55,054 --> 00:35:57,291
It's as if it's speaking to me.

440
00:35:57,542 --> 00:35:59,534
What does it say?

441
00:36:00,183 --> 00:36:03,472
I don't... I don't know.
Something.

442
00:36:15,824 --> 00:36:18,199
Tell me what you feel.

443
00:36:25,312 --> 00:36:28,678
I just feel you.

444
00:36:36,504 --> 00:36:38,456
So there's a 10 AM to Glasgow

445
00:36:38,656 --> 00:36:40,800
to give us more time together
before you went back.

446
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:43,824
- What if I miss that train?
- There is an 11.

447
00:36:43,855 --> 00:36:46,605
What if I missed all the trains?

448
00:36:47,504 --> 00:36:49,597
What if this time,
I didn't go back?

449
00:36:49,622 --> 00:36:52,247
- You gave Stark your word.
- I would rather give it to you.

450
00:36:52,272 --> 00:36:55,717
Well there are people expecting me too,
you know. We both made promises.

451
00:36:55,725 --> 00:36:57,412
Not to each other.

452
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,693
Wanda...

453
00:36:59,844 --> 00:37:03,632
For two years, we've stolen these moments,
trying to see if this could work, and,

454
00:37:03,657 --> 00:37:08,218
I don't know, I, but, eh, ah, first...
you know what, I'm just gonna speak for myself.

455
00:37:08,243 --> 00:37:12,735
- I, I... I think...I think...
- It works. - It works. - It works.

456
00:37:15,173 --> 00:37:18,677
Stay.
Stay with me.

457
00:37:23,935 --> 00:37:27,130
Or not. If I'm overstepping...

458
00:37:34,106 --> 00:37:36,168
What are they?

459
00:37:36,278 --> 00:37:39,465
What the stone was
warning me about.

460
00:37:48,515 --> 00:37:53,233
- I have to go.
- No, Vision. Vision, if that's true...

461
00:37:53,406 --> 00:37:56,343
Then maybe going isn't
the best idea.

462
00:37:56,937 --> 00:37:59,823
- Wanda, I...
- Vision!

463
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:31,397
The blade. It stopped
me from phasing.

464
00:38:31,781 --> 00:38:35,181
- Is that even possible?
- It isn't supposed to be.

465
00:38:35,254 --> 00:38:36,854
My systems are failing.

466
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:38,670
I'm beginning to think...

467
00:38:39,121 --> 00:38:41,821
We should've stayed in bed.

468
00:38:42,619 --> 00:38:44,103
Vis!

469
00:38:52,751 --> 00:38:56,813
Give up the Stone,
and she lives.

470
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,506
Hands off.

471
00:39:52,544 --> 00:39:56,536
Come on. You gotta get up.
You gotta get up. Come on.

472
00:39:58,223 --> 00:40:00,605
We have to go.

473
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:05,933
- Please leave.
- You asked me to stay.

474
00:40:06,848 --> 00:40:09,098
I'm staying.

475
00:41:19,383 --> 00:41:21,109
- Get up.
- I can't.

476
00:41:21,156 --> 00:41:23,953
We don't wanna kill you.
But we will.

477
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,078
You'll never get
the chance again.

478
00:41:42,035 --> 00:41:43,738
Can you stand?

479
00:41:48,495 --> 00:41:51,323
Thank you, Captain.

480
00:41:52,436 --> 00:41:55,034
Let's get you on the jet.

481
00:41:57,861 --> 00:42:01,302
I thought
we had a deal.

482
00:42:01,457 --> 00:42:05,316
Stay close, check in.
Don't take any chances.

483
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:09,417
Sorry. We just wanted time.

484
00:42:11,605 --> 00:42:13,699
Where to, Cap?

485
00:42:15,832 --> 00:42:17,472
Home.

486
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:22,921
Shh. We'll be safe.
We'll be safe.

487
00:42:47,257 --> 00:42:49,937
- Zehoberians...
- Mother!

488
00:42:49,977 --> 00:42:53,250
- Choose a side, or die.
- Mother!  Mother!

489
00:42:53,741 --> 00:42:58,842
One side is a reservation.
The other, an honor known only to the wheat.

490
00:42:59,889 --> 00:43:02,192
What's wrong, little one?

491
00:43:02,217 --> 00:43:06,185
My mother. Where is my mother?

492
00:43:09,981 --> 00:43:12,219
What's your name?

493
00:43:12,587 --> 00:43:14,735
Gamora.

494
00:43:14,868 --> 00:43:18,188
You're quite the
fighter, Gamora.

495
00:43:18,586 --> 00:43:22,484
Come. Let me help you.

496
00:43:34,313 --> 00:43:36,203
Look.

497
00:43:39,157 --> 00:43:43,281
Pretty, isn't it?
Perfectly balanced.

498
00:43:43,313 --> 00:43:45,422
As all things should be.

499
00:43:45,454 --> 00:43:50,398
Too much to one side,
or the other...

500
00:43:52,699 --> 00:43:56,620
Here. You try.

501
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:04,076
Now go in peace, and
meet your maker.

502
00:44:07,870 --> 00:44:10,408
Concentrate.

503
00:44:12,401 --> 00:44:16,532
There! You've got it.

504
00:44:24,733 --> 00:44:26,420
Gamora.

505
00:44:26,753 --> 00:44:30,889
Do you know if these grenades are the
"blow off your junk" kind or the gas kind?

506
00:44:30,912 --> 00:44:33,591
'Cause I was thinking about hanging
a couple on my belt right here.

507
00:44:33,615 --> 00:44:36,638
- But I don't want to...
- I need to ask a favor.

508
00:44:36,662 --> 00:44:38,568
Yeah, sure.

509
00:44:39,482 --> 00:44:43,415
One way or another, the path
that we're on leads to Thanos.

510
00:44:44,615 --> 00:44:47,341
Which is what the
grenades are for.

511
00:44:47,568 --> 00:44:49,768
I'm sorry. What's the favor?

512
00:44:51,332 --> 00:44:53,871
If things go wrong...

513
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,730
If Thanos gets me...

514
00:45:00,825 --> 00:45:05,317
I want you to promise me...
you'll kill me.

515
00:45:05,395 --> 00:45:07,106
What?

516
00:45:09,755 --> 00:45:12,723
I know something he doesn't.

517
00:45:14,724 --> 00:45:16,895
If he finds it out...

518
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:20,216
- The entire Universe could be at risk.
- What do you know?

519
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,146
If I tell you, you'd know, too.

520
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:28,854
If it's so important,
shouldn't I?

521
00:45:28,879 --> 00:45:30,047
Only if you wanna die.

522
00:45:30,059 --> 00:45:32,910
Why does somebody always
have to die in this scenario?

523
00:45:32,988 --> 00:45:34,418
Just...

524
00:45:36,122 --> 00:45:39,418
trust me. And
possibly, kill me.

525
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:43,762
I mean, I'd like to.
I really would...

526
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:46,121
Swear to me.

527
00:45:48,691 --> 00:45:51,576
Swear to me on your mother.

528
00:45:58,485 --> 00:46:00,297
Okay.

529
00:46:04,791 --> 00:46:06,591
Okay.

530
00:46:22,756 --> 00:46:25,498
Dude! How long have you
been standing there?

531
00:46:25,522 --> 00:46:28,264
- An hour.
- An hour?

532
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:29,982
Are you serious?

533
00:46:29,999 --> 00:46:35,803
I've mastered the ability, of
standing so incredibly still...

534
00:46:36,194 --> 00:46:40,802
That I've become invisible
to the eye. Watch.

535
00:46:44,183 --> 00:46:48,260
- You're eating a zarg nut.
- But my movement...

536
00:46:48,386 --> 00:46:50,682
So slow...

537
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:55,018
- That it's imperceptible.
- No.

538
00:46:55,073 --> 00:46:57,987
- I'm sure I'm invisible.
- Hi, Drax.

539
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:02,065
Damn it.

540
00:47:21,219 --> 00:47:24,835
- This place looks deserted.
- I'm reading movement.

541
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:28,602
- In the third quadrant.
- Yeah. I'm picking that up, too.

542
00:47:29,548 --> 00:47:32,314
Let's put down over here.

543
00:47:46,588 --> 00:47:49,468
Everyone in the galaxy knows you
would sell your own brother if

544
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:53,070
you thought it would add even the
slightest trinket to your pathetic collection.

545
00:48:00,969 --> 00:48:03,649
I know you have the Reality Stone, Tivan.

546
00:48:03,879 --> 00:48:08,484
Giving it to me will spare you
a great deal of suffering.

547
00:48:11,284 --> 00:48:15,494
I told you. I sold it.

548
00:48:17,428 --> 00:48:22,662
- Why would I lie?
- I imagine it's like breathing for you.

549
00:48:23,076 --> 00:48:26,966
- Like suicide.
- So you do understand.

550
00:48:27,006 --> 00:48:29,849
Not even you will surrender
something so precious.

551
00:48:29,881 --> 00:48:32,013
I didn't know what it was.

552
00:48:32,021 --> 00:48:35,154
Then you're more of a
fool than I took you for.

553
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:38,216
- That's him.
- Last chance, charlatan.

554
00:48:39,026 --> 00:48:41,026
Where's the Stone?

555
00:48:41,143 --> 00:48:46,127
Today, he pays for the deaths
of my wife and daughter.

556
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:47,775
Drax, wait!

557
00:48:48,284 --> 00:48:50,518
Whoa, not yet!
Not yet!

558
00:48:55,704 --> 00:48:57,104
Listen to me.

559
00:48:57,173 --> 00:48:59,985
He doesn't have the Stone yet.

560
00:49:00,017 --> 00:49:02,321
We get it, and then
we can stop him.

561
00:49:02,362 --> 00:49:05,205
We have to get the Stone first.
Yeah.

562
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:10,635
No. No. For Ovette.
For Camaria.

563
00:49:10,667 --> 00:49:12,549
Sleep.

564
00:49:23,773 --> 00:49:28,991
Okay. Gamora, Mantis,
you go right.

565
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:32,311
I'm... The other right!

566
00:49:55,589 --> 00:49:58,167
Why?

567
00:50:07,143 --> 00:50:11,596
Why you? Daughter...

568
00:50:30,073 --> 00:50:32,260
That was quick.

569
00:50:36,796 --> 00:50:40,133
Magnificent! Magnificent!

570
00:50:40,137 --> 00:50:42,037
Magnificent!

571
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:47,741
<i>Is that sadness I sense
in you, daughter?</i>

572
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:53,538
<i>In my heart, I knew
you still cared.</i>

573
00:50:59,744 --> 00:51:02,923
<i>But one never knows for sure.</i>

574
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:15,886
<i>Reality is often disappointing.</i>

575
00:51:18,349 --> 00:51:21,591
That is, it was.

576
00:51:22,583 --> 00:51:24,169
Now...

577
00:51:26,018 --> 00:51:29,471
Reality can be whatever I want.

578
00:51:30,135 --> 00:51:33,736
- You knew I'd come.
- I counted on it.

579
00:51:34,162 --> 00:51:37,990
There's something we need
to discuss, little one.

580
00:51:41,778 --> 00:51:43,793
Thanos!

581
00:51:56,723 --> 00:52:00,449
- Let her go, Grimace!
- Peter...

582
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:03,973
- I told you to go right.
- Now? Really?

583
00:52:04,012 --> 00:52:08,504
- You let her go!
- Ah, the boyfriend.

584
00:52:09,207 --> 00:52:13,425
I like to think of myself more as a
Titan-killing long-term booty call.

585
00:52:13,449 --> 00:52:15,410
- Let her go.
- Peter...

586
00:52:15,434 --> 00:52:20,082
Or I'm gonna blow that nut-sack
of a chin right off your face!

587
00:52:20,481 --> 00:52:23,402
Not him.

588
00:52:32,585 --> 00:52:35,514
You promised!

589
00:52:40,642 --> 00:52:45,071
Oh, daughter. You expect
too much from him.

590
00:52:48,358 --> 00:52:51,295
She's asked, hasn't she?

591
00:52:53,796 --> 00:52:55,373
Do it.

592
00:53:01,108 --> 00:53:02,943
Do it!

593
00:53:09,521 --> 00:53:12,146
I told you to go right!

594
00:53:12,842 --> 00:53:16,013
I love you, more than anything.

595
00:53:18,919 --> 00:53:21,561
I love you, too.

596
00:53:34,547 --> 00:53:36,476
I like you.

597
00:54:06,570 --> 00:54:08,303
Still no word from Vision?

598
00:54:08,336 --> 00:54:10,992
Satellites lost him
somewhere over Edinburgh.

599
00:54:11,008 --> 00:54:14,976
On a stolen quinjet with four of
the world's most wanted criminals.

600
00:54:14,992 --> 00:54:16,198
You know they're only criminals

601
00:54:16,398 --> 00:54:18,422
because you've chosen to call them that,
right, sir?

602
00:54:18,447 --> 00:54:22,862
My God, Rhodes, your talent
for horseshit rivals my own.

603
00:54:22,885 --> 00:54:26,329
If it weren't for those Accords,
Vision would've been right here.

604
00:54:26,337 --> 00:54:29,837
I remember your signature
on those papers, Colonel.

605
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:31,694
That's right.

606
00:54:33,341 --> 00:54:35,094
And I'm pretty sure
I've paid for that.

607
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:38,423
- Do you have second thoughts?
- Not anymore.

608
00:54:44,069 --> 00:54:47,342
Mr. Secretary.

609
00:54:50,015 --> 00:54:53,733
You got some nerve.
I'll give you that.

610
00:54:54,189 --> 00:54:56,702
You could use some
of that right now.

611
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:59,733
The world's on fire.

612
00:54:59,812 --> 00:55:03,390
And you think, all is forgiven?

613
00:55:03,484 --> 00:55:08,249
I'm not looking for forgiveness. And
I'm way past asking permission.

614
00:55:09,367 --> 00:55:14,350
Earth just lost her best defender.
So we're here to fight.

615
00:55:14,663 --> 00:55:17,272
And if you wanna
stand in our way...

616
00:55:17,859 --> 00:55:20,015
We'll fight you, too.

617
00:55:23,074 --> 00:55:26,636
- Arrest them.
- All over it.

618
00:55:31,792 --> 00:55:34,002
That's a court-martial.

619
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:39,464
- It's great to see you, Cap.
- You too, Rhodey.

620
00:55:39,489 --> 00:55:40,818
Hey.

621
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:47,129
Well. You guys, really
look like crap.

622
00:55:47,184 --> 00:55:48,949
Must've been a rough
couple of years.

623
00:55:48,965 --> 00:55:52,097
Yeah, well, the hotels
weren't exactly five star.

624
00:55:52,106 --> 00:55:54,410
I think you look great.

625
00:56:01,236 --> 00:56:03,571
Yeah. I'm back.

626
00:56:04,845 --> 00:56:06,454
Hi, Bruce.

627
00:56:11,372 --> 00:56:12,950
Nat.

628
00:56:15,770 --> 00:56:18,340
This is awkward.

629
00:56:19,804 --> 00:56:21,705
So we gotta assume they're
coming back, right?

630
00:56:21,717 --> 00:56:23,047
And they can clearly find us.

631
00:56:23,062 --> 00:56:25,491
We need all hands on deck.
Where's Clint?

632
00:56:25,499 --> 00:56:27,867
After the whole Accords
situation, he and Scott

633
00:56:27,879 --> 00:56:30,209
took a deal. It was too tough on their
families, they're on house arrest.

634
00:56:30,234 --> 00:56:31,780
- Who's Scott?
- Ant-Man.

635
00:56:31,804 --> 00:56:34,202
There's an Ant-Man
and a Spider-Man?

636
00:56:34,226 --> 00:56:35,226
Okay, look...

637
00:56:35,249 --> 00:56:38,249
Thanos has the biggest
army in the Universe.

638
00:56:38,265 --> 00:56:42,209
And he is not gonna
stop until he... He gets...

639
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:44,907
Vision's stone.

640
00:56:44,932 --> 00:56:48,884
- Well then, we have to protect it.
- No, we have to destroy it.

641
00:56:50,225 --> 00:56:54,678
I've been giving a good deal of thought to
this entity in my head about its nature.

642
00:56:54,694 --> 00:56:56,959
But also, its composition.

643
00:56:57,002 --> 00:56:59,653
I think if it were exposed
to a sufficiently

644
00:56:59,665 --> 00:57:01,736
powerful energy
source, something,

645
00:57:01,761 --> 00:57:05,526
very similar to its own
signature, perhaps...

646
00:57:06,534 --> 00:57:09,456
Its molecular
integrity could fail.

647
00:57:09,589 --> 00:57:11,909
And you, with it.

648
00:57:12,003 --> 00:57:13,659
We're not having
this conversation.

649
00:57:13,671 --> 00:57:16,260
Eliminating the stone is the
only way to be certain that

650
00:57:16,285 --> 00:57:20,853
- Thanos can't get it.
- That's too high a price.

651
00:57:24,789 --> 00:57:28,320
Only you have the
power to pay it.

652
00:57:31,469 --> 00:57:33,611
Thanos threatens
half the Universe.

653
00:57:33,636 --> 00:57:37,067
One life cannot stand in
the way of defeating him.

654
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:38,226
But it should.

655
00:57:40,031 --> 00:57:41,462
We don't trade lives, Vision.

656
00:57:41,487 --> 00:57:45,845
Captain, 70 years ago, you laid down your
life to save how many millions of people.

657
00:57:45,870 --> 00:57:47,979
Tell me, why is
this any different?

658
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:51,346
Because you might have a choice.

659
00:57:51,612 --> 00:57:55,658
Your mind is made up of a
complex construct of overlays.

660
00:57:55,667 --> 00:57:59,403
Jarvis, Ultron, Tony,
me, the stone.

661
00:57:59,442 --> 00:58:03,236
All of them mixed together. All of
them learning from one another.

662
00:58:03,261 --> 00:58:06,431
- You're saying Vision isn't just the stone?
- I'm saying that...

663
00:58:06,456 --> 00:58:10,166
If we take out the stone, there's
still a whole lot of Vision left.

664
00:58:10,175 --> 00:58:13,362
- Perhaps the best parts.
- Can we do that?

665
00:58:13,681 --> 00:58:15,415
Not me. Not here.

666
00:58:15,741 --> 00:58:18,759
Well you better find someone
and somewhere fast.

667
00:58:18,801 --> 00:58:22,676
Ross isn't just gonna let you
guys have your old rooms back.

668
00:58:24,184 --> 00:58:26,894
I know somewhere.

669
00:58:40,602 --> 00:58:43,443
The Kingsguard and the Dora
Milaje have been alerted.

670
00:58:43,468 --> 00:58:45,287
And the Border Tribe?

671
00:58:45,312 --> 00:58:49,499
- Those that are left.
- Send word to the Jabari as well.

672
00:58:49,539 --> 00:58:52,101
M'Baku likes a good fight.

673
00:58:52,215 --> 00:58:53,480
Ewe Kunga.
[Yes my King.]

674
00:58:53,484 --> 00:58:55,882
And what of this one?

675
00:58:56,131 --> 00:58:58,662
This one may be tired of war.

676
00:58:58,687 --> 00:59:02,608
But the White Wolf has
rested long enough.

677
00:59:24,433 --> 00:59:26,183
Where's the fight?

678
00:59:26,863 --> 00:59:28,651
On its way.

679
00:59:46,804 --> 00:59:50,311
In all the time I
have served Thanos...

680
00:59:51,238 --> 00:59:53,714
I have never failed him.

681
00:59:58,017 --> 01:00:01,415
If I were to reach our
rendezvous on Titan,

682
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:05,197
with the Time Stone still attached
to your vaguely irritating person...

683
01:00:05,222 --> 01:00:08,104
There would be judgment.

684
01:00:16,545 --> 01:00:18,466
Give me...

685
01:00:22,312 --> 01:00:24,279
the Stone.

686
01:00:35,634 --> 01:00:38,571
Wow. You are a seriously loyal
piece of head-o-ware, aren't you.

687
01:00:38,587 --> 01:00:40,688
Yeah, uh...
Speaking of loyalty...

688
01:00:41,048 --> 01:00:43,780
- What the...!
- I know what you're gonna say.
- You should not be here.

689
01:00:43,805 --> 01:00:44,805
- I was gonna go home.
- I don't wanna hear it!

690
01:00:44,821 --> 01:00:47,519
But it was such a long way down
and I just thought about you...

691
01:00:47,531 --> 01:00:48,711
- And now I gotta hear it.
- ...and I kinda stuck to the side of the ship.

692
01:00:48,735 --> 01:00:51,867
And this suit is, ridiculously
intuitive, by the way.

693
01:00:51,881 --> 01:00:54,992
So, if anything, its kind of
your fault that I'm here.

694
01:00:55,017 --> 01:00:56,618
- What did you just say?
- I take that back.

695
01:00:56,634 --> 01:00:58,181
And now I'm here in space.

696
01:00:58,193 --> 01:01:00,755
Yeah. Right where I
didn't want you to be.

697
01:01:00,802 --> 01:01:03,053
This isn't Coney Island,
or some field trip.

698
01:01:03,065 --> 01:01:04,977
This is a one-way ticket.
Do you hear me?

699
01:01:05,001 --> 01:01:06,845
- Don't pretend you thought this through.
- I did think this through.

700
01:01:06,850 --> 01:01:08,651
- I did think this through.
- You could not have possibly thought this through.

701
01:01:08,670 --> 01:01:12,982
You can't be a friendly neighborhood
Spider-Man if there's no neighborhood.

702
01:01:14,134 --> 01:01:17,680
Okay, that didn't really make sense but
you know what I'm trying to say.

703
01:01:19,335 --> 01:01:22,378
Come on. We got a situation.

704
01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:26,061
See him down there? He's in trouble.
What's your plan? Go.

705
01:01:26,585 --> 01:01:28,412
Um. Okay, okay. Uh...

706
01:01:28,725 --> 01:01:31,553
OK, did you ever see this
really old movie Aliens?

707
01:01:35,021 --> 01:01:37,740
Painful, aren't they?

708
01:01:38,145 --> 01:01:41,560
They were originally
designed for microsurgery.

709
01:01:41,684 --> 01:01:43,902
And any one of them...

710
01:01:48,332 --> 01:01:51,378
...could end your friend's
life in an instant.

711
01:01:51,410 --> 01:01:53,527
I gotta tell you, he's
not really my friend.

712
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:57,136
Saving his life is more of
a professional courtesy.

713
01:01:57,855 --> 01:01:59,707
You'll save nothing.

714
01:02:00,668 --> 01:02:04,261
Your powers are inconsequential
compared to mine.

715
01:02:04,277 --> 01:02:06,933
Yeah, but the kid's
seen more movies.

716
01:02:19,210 --> 01:02:20,842
Yes!

717
01:02:21,302 --> 01:02:23,365
Wait, what are those?

718
01:02:37,775 --> 01:02:40,150
Hey, we haven't officially met.

719
01:02:40,853 --> 01:02:41,986
Cool.

720
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:47,399
- We gotta turn this ship around.
- Yeah. Now he wants to run.

721
01:02:47,415 --> 01:02:49,229
- Great.
- I want to protect the stone.

722
01:02:49,254 --> 01:02:52,027
And I want you to thank me now.
Go ahead, I'm listening.

723
01:02:52,043 --> 01:02:55,011
For what? Nearly
blasting me into space?

724
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:57,800
Who just saved your magical ass?
Me.

725
01:02:57,809 --> 01:03:00,052
I seriously don't know how you
fit your head into that helmet.

726
01:03:00,076 --> 01:03:02,395
Admit it. You should've ducked
out when I told you to.

727
01:03:02,403 --> 01:03:04,223
I tried to bench
you, you refused.

728
01:03:04,248 --> 01:03:06,481
Unlike everyone else in your
life, I don't work for you.

729
01:03:06,506 --> 01:03:09,024
And due to that fact,
we're now in a flying doughnut,

730
01:03:09,224 --> 01:03:10,377
billions of miles from Earth,

731
01:03:10,437 --> 01:03:11,601
- with no back-up.
- I'm back-up!

732
01:03:11,626 --> 01:03:14,604
No. You're a stowaway.
The adults are talking.

733
01:03:14,629 --> 01:03:18,870
I'm sorry, I'm confused as to the relationship
here, I mean, what is he? Your ward?

734
01:03:18,895 --> 01:03:22,605
- No. I'm Peter, by the way.
- Doctor Strange.

735
01:03:22,630 --> 01:03:25,051
Oh, you're using your
made-up names. Um,

736
01:03:25,076 --> 01:03:26,888
I'm Spider-Man, then.

737
01:03:27,107 --> 01:03:29,865
This ship is self-correcting its course.
The thing's on autopilot.

738
01:03:29,890 --> 01:03:33,474
Can we control it? Fly us home?

739
01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:37,822
- Stark.
- Yeah?

740
01:03:37,846 --> 01:03:40,627
- Can you get us home?
- Yeah. I heard you.

741
01:03:41,877 --> 01:03:44,908
I'm not so sure we should.

742
01:03:45,018 --> 01:03:49,212
Under no circumstances can we
bring the Time Stone to Thanos.

743
01:03:49,283 --> 01:03:51,845
I don't think you quite
understand what's at stake here.

744
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:54,204
What? No. It's you who doesn't
understand that

745
01:03:54,216 --> 01:03:56,791
Thanos has been inside
my head for six years

746
01:03:56,823 --> 01:04:00,166
since he sent an army to New
York, and now he's back!

747
01:04:00,191 --> 01:04:02,261
And I don't know what to do.

748
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:05,897
So I'm not so sure if it's a better
plan to fight him on our turf or his.

749
01:04:05,922 --> 01:04:09,351
But you saw what they
did, what they can do.

750
01:04:09,472 --> 01:04:12,003
At least, on his turf
he's not expecting it.

751
01:04:12,039 --> 01:04:16,111
So I say we take the
fight to him, Doctor.

752
01:04:17,469 --> 01:04:19,601
Do you concur?

753
01:04:21,619 --> 01:04:24,861
All right, Stark. We go to him.

754
01:04:25,127 --> 01:04:27,314
But you have to understand...

755
01:04:27,487 --> 01:04:31,987
If it comes to saving you, or
the kid, or the Time Stone...

756
01:04:32,042 --> 01:04:35,637
I will not hesitate to
let either of you die.

757
01:04:35,662 --> 01:04:39,818
I can't. Because the
Universe depends on it.

758
01:04:39,843 --> 01:04:43,319
Nice. Good, moral compass.

759
01:04:43,866 --> 01:04:45,466
We're straight.

760
01:04:46,169 --> 01:04:48,887
All right, kid...

761
01:04:49,771 --> 01:04:52,386
You're an Avenger now.

762
01:05:26,984 --> 01:05:29,687
I thought you might be hungry.

763
01:05:41,407 --> 01:05:43,648
I always hated that chair.

764
01:05:43,663 --> 01:05:45,461
So I've been told.

765
01:05:45,737 --> 01:05:50,112
Even so, I hoped you'd
sit in it one day.

766
01:05:50,545 --> 01:05:54,326
I hated this room, this ship...

767
01:05:54,472 --> 01:05:57,136
I hated my life.

768
01:06:00,385 --> 01:06:03,133
You told me that, too.

769
01:06:06,032 --> 01:06:08,274
Every day.

770
01:06:10,239 --> 01:06:12,957
For almost twenty years.

771
01:06:14,462 --> 01:06:16,938
I was a child when you took me.

772
01:06:18,085 --> 01:06:20,460
I saved you.

773
01:06:22,929 --> 01:06:28,965
No. No. We were happy
on my home planet.

774
01:06:29,013 --> 01:06:32,879
Going to bed hungry?
Scrounging for scraps?

775
01:06:32,904 --> 01:06:37,794
Your planet was on the brink of collapse.
I'm the one who stopped that.

776
01:06:38,230 --> 01:06:40,394
You know what's happened since then?

777
01:06:40,427 --> 01:06:44,466
The children born have
known nothing but full

778
01:06:44,478 --> 01:06:48,098
bellies and clear skies.
It's a paradise.

779
01:06:49,678 --> 01:06:52,092
Because you murdered
half the planet.

780
01:06:52,117 --> 01:06:54,898
A small price to
pay for salvation.

781
01:06:55,015 --> 01:06:58,312
- You're insane.
- Little one, it's a simple calculus.

782
01:06:58,337 --> 01:07:01,547
This universe is finite.
Its resources, finite.

783
01:07:01,572 --> 01:07:05,806
If life is left unchecked,
life will cease to exist.

784
01:07:06,077 --> 01:07:10,069
- It needs correction.
- You don't know that!

785
01:07:10,241 --> 01:07:13,116
I'm the only one who knows that.

786
01:07:13,124 --> 01:07:17,811
At least, I'm the only one
with the will to act on it.

787
01:07:19,086 --> 01:07:21,757
For a time...

788
01:07:22,461 --> 01:07:23,601
You...

789
01:07:24,890 --> 01:07:27,116
had that same will,

790
01:07:28,356 --> 01:07:32,789
as you fought by my side,
daughter.

791
01:07:33,425 --> 01:07:36,182
I'm not your daughter.

792
01:07:37,605 --> 01:07:40,862
Everything I hate about
myself, you taught me.

793
01:07:41,066 --> 01:07:45,154
And in doing so, made you the
fiercest woman in the galaxy.

794
01:07:47,737 --> 01:07:51,354
It's why I trusted you
to find the Soul Stone.

795
01:07:53,917 --> 01:07:57,377
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

796
01:07:57,862 --> 01:07:59,862
I am disappointed.

797
01:08:00,062 --> 01:08:02,909
But not because
you didn't find it.

798
01:08:06,726 --> 01:08:09,265
But because you did.

799
01:08:09,837 --> 01:08:12,061
And you lied.

800
01:08:28,714 --> 01:08:30,417
Nebula!

801
01:08:36,978 --> 01:08:38,494
Don't do this.

802
01:08:38,622 --> 01:08:42,926
Some time ago, your sister snuck
aboard this ship to kill me.

803
01:08:42,951 --> 01:08:46,356
- Please, don't do this.
- She very nearly succeeded.

804
01:08:46,854 --> 01:08:51,541
So, I brought her here...
to talk.

805
01:08:58,419 --> 01:09:01,559
Stop. Stop it.

806
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:09,441
I swear to you, on my life...

807
01:09:09,516 --> 01:09:13,368
I never found the Soul Stone.

808
01:09:16,169 --> 01:09:17,700
Accessing memory files.

809
01:09:17,725 --> 01:09:19,568
You know what he's about to do.

810
01:09:19,584 --> 01:09:22,646
He's finally ready, and he's going
for the stones. All of them.

811
01:09:22,655 --> 01:09:26,756
- He'll never get them all.
- He will.  - He can't, Nebula.

812
01:09:26,781 --> 01:09:30,874
Because I found the map to the Soul
Stone, and I burned it to ash.

813
01:09:30,907 --> 01:09:33,555
I burned it.

814
01:09:37,024 --> 01:09:39,844
You're strong.

815
01:09:40,664 --> 01:09:42,703
Me.

816
01:09:44,555 --> 01:09:48,359
The generous... me.

817
01:09:50,378 --> 01:09:53,034
I never taught you to lie.

818
01:09:53,050 --> 01:09:55,971
That's why you're so bad at it.

819
01:09:57,753 --> 01:10:02,159
Where is the Soul Stone?

820
01:10:19,573 --> 01:10:21,494
Vormir.

821
01:10:38,756 --> 01:10:40,959
The stone is on Vormir.

822
01:10:43,569 --> 01:10:46,490
Show me.

823
01:10:47,975 --> 01:10:49,201
I am Groot.

824
01:10:49,401 --> 01:10:51,619
Tinkle in the cup.
We're not looking, what's there to see?

825
01:10:51,819 --> 01:10:54,326
What's a twig?
Everybody's seen a twig.

826
01:10:54,330 --> 01:10:55,587
I am Groot!

827
01:10:55,687 --> 01:10:57,354
You can pour what's
in the cup out in space

828
01:10:57,379 --> 01:10:58,611
then go in the cup again.

829
01:10:58,636 --> 01:10:59,771
You speak Groot?

830
01:10:59,971 --> 01:11:01,909
Yes, they toured on Asgard,
it was an elective.

831
01:11:01,925 --> 01:11:05,034
- I am Groot.
- You'll know when we're close.

832
01:11:05,038 --> 01:11:09,741
Nivadellir's forge harnesses the
blazing power of the Neutron star.

833
01:11:12,169 --> 01:11:13,871
It's the birthplace of my hammer.

834
01:11:14,823 --> 01:11:16,233
It's truly awesome.

835
01:11:22,530 --> 01:11:25,874
Okay. Time to be the captain.

836
01:11:30,779 --> 01:11:34,747
So dead brother, huh? Yeah,
that could be annoying.

837
01:11:35,170 --> 01:11:38,272
Well, he's been dead before.

838
01:11:38,311 --> 01:11:41,631
Now this time, I think
it really might be true.

839
01:11:41,639 --> 01:11:45,537
- And you said your sister and your dad...
- Both dead.

840
01:11:45,868 --> 01:11:49,532
- But still got a mom, though?
- Killed by a Dark Elf.

841
01:11:49,579 --> 01:11:53,258
- A best friend?
- Stabbed through the heart.

842
01:11:55,428 --> 01:11:59,068
Are you sure you're up to
this particular murder mission?

843
01:12:00,861 --> 01:12:02,221
Absolutely!

844
01:12:02,421 --> 01:12:05,181
Oh, rage and, uh,
vengeance, anger...

845
01:12:05,189 --> 01:12:08,088
Loss, regret, they're all
tremendous motivators.

846
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:10,892
They really clear the mind,
so I'm, uh, good to go.

847
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:14,010
Yeah, but, I mean, this
Thanos we're talking about,

848
01:12:14,210 --> 01:12:16,033
he's the toughest there is.

849
01:12:16,058 --> 01:12:18,253
- Well, he's never fought me.
- Yeah, he has.

850
01:12:18,278 --> 01:12:19,925
He's never fought me twice.

851
01:12:20,256 --> 01:12:22,824
And I'm getting a new
hammer, don't forget.

852
01:12:22,849 --> 01:12:25,599
Well, it better be some hammer.

853
01:12:29,002 --> 01:12:32,087
You know, I'm 1,500 years old.

854
01:12:32,111 --> 01:12:34,225
I've killed twice as many
enemies as that, and

855
01:12:34,237 --> 01:12:36,228
every one of them
would've rather killed me

856
01:12:36,253 --> 01:12:37,878
but none succeeded.

857
01:12:37,903 --> 01:12:40,871
I'm only alive because
fate wants me alive.

858
01:12:40,892 --> 01:12:44,065
Thanos is just the latest
in a long line of bastards

859
01:12:44,090 --> 01:12:48,274
and he will be the latest to feel
my vengeance. Fate wills it so.

860
01:12:49,268 --> 01:12:52,111
And what if you're wrong?

861
01:12:54,533 --> 01:12:57,048
Well, if I'm wrong, then...

862
01:12:57,430 --> 01:13:00,868
What more could I lose?

863
01:13:12,266 --> 01:13:16,726
I could lose a lot. Me
personally, I could lose a lot.

864
01:13:20,361 --> 01:13:21,923
Okay.

865
01:13:22,845 --> 01:13:26,648
Well, if fate does want you
to kill that crapsack,

866
01:13:26,673 --> 01:13:29,212
- you're gonna need more than one stupid eyeball.
- What's this?

867
01:13:29,237 --> 01:13:30,373
What's it look like?

868
01:13:30,796 --> 01:13:33,651
Some jerk lost a bet
with me on Contraxia.

869
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:36,080
- And he gave you his eye?
- No, he gave me 100 credits.

870
01:13:36,104 --> 01:13:39,627
I snuck into his room later
that night and stole his eye.

871
01:13:40,893 --> 01:13:43,721
Thank you, sweet rabbit.

872
01:13:49,025 --> 01:13:50,025
Ooh!

873
01:13:50,355 --> 01:13:52,793
I would've washed that. Ahem.

874
01:13:52,818 --> 01:13:55,839
The only way I could sneak it
off Contraxia was up my a--

875
01:13:56,351 --> 01:13:58,044
Hey, we're here.

876
01:14:02,237 --> 01:14:05,729
I don't think this thing works.
Everything seems dark.

877
01:14:06,866 --> 01:14:09,436
But it ain't the eye.

878
01:14:21,991 --> 01:14:26,772
Something's wrong.
The star's gone out.

879
01:14:26,803 --> 01:14:30,326
And the rings are frozen.

880
01:14:49,262 --> 01:14:53,589
I hope these dwarfs are better at
forging than they are cleaning.

881
01:14:57,799 --> 01:15:01,290
Maybe they realized that they live in a
junk pile in the middle of space.

882
01:15:01,306 --> 01:15:04,728
This forge hasn't gone
dark in centuries.

883
01:15:06,346 --> 01:15:10,595
- You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right?
- Yes. Why?

884
01:15:10,611 --> 01:15:13,642
Did it look anything like that?

885
01:15:15,931 --> 01:15:20,243
- I am Groot.
- Get back to the pod.

886
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:26,828
Eitri, wait! Stop!

887
01:15:29,387 --> 01:15:30,879
Thor?

888
01:15:33,179 --> 01:15:38,163
- What happened here?
- You were supposed to protect us.

889
01:15:38,366 --> 01:15:44,258
- Asgard was supposed to protect us.
- Asgard is destroyed.

890
01:15:45,786 --> 01:15:49,661
Eitri, the glove... What did you do?

891
01:16:02,267 --> 01:16:06,212
300 dwarfs lived on this ring.

892
01:16:06,391 --> 01:16:09,985
I thought if I did what
he asked, they'd be safe.

893
01:16:12,016 --> 01:16:14,836
I made what he wanted.

894
01:16:15,173 --> 01:16:20,227
A device capable of harnessing
the power of the stones.

895
01:16:21,871 --> 01:16:26,700
And he...and he killed everyone anyway.

896
01:16:28,882 --> 01:16:31,413
All except me.

897
01:16:31,537 --> 01:16:34,818
"Your life is yours," he said.

898
01:16:34,843 --> 01:16:39,577
"But your hands. Your
hands are mine alone."

899
01:16:39,655 --> 01:16:42,366
Eitri, this isn't
about your hands.

900
01:16:42,686 --> 01:16:44,585
Every weapon you've
ever designed,

901
01:16:44,610 --> 01:16:48,765
every axe, hammer, sword,
it's all inside your head.

902
01:16:49,116 --> 01:16:52,905
Now I know it feels like all hope is lost.
Trust me, I know.

903
01:16:53,194 --> 01:16:59,093
But together, you and
I, we can kill Thanos.

904
01:17:38,366 --> 01:17:40,951
Mantis, listen very carefully.

905
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:43,741
I need you to meet me on Titan.

906
01:17:49,792 --> 01:17:52,315
- Hey, what's going on?
- I think we're here.

907
01:17:52,340 --> 01:17:55,316
I don't think this rig has
a self-park function.

908
01:17:56,183 --> 01:17:58,831
Get your hand inside the steering gimble.
Close those around it.

909
01:18:00,048 --> 01:18:00,588
Okay. Yeah.

910
01:18:00,612 --> 01:18:04,377
Understand? Now we gotta be one big guy, so we
gotta move at the same time.

911
01:18:04,383 --> 01:18:05,383
Okay. Ready?

912
01:18:09,644 --> 01:18:13,651
We might, uh, wanna turn, turn, turn.
Turn!

913
01:18:41,627 --> 01:18:43,650
You all right?

914
01:18:44,846 --> 01:18:47,439
That was close.

915
01:18:47,635 --> 01:18:49,478
I owe you one.

916
01:18:49,510 --> 01:18:53,822
Let me just say, if aliens wind up
implanting eggs in my chest or something,

917
01:18:53,860 --> 01:18:56,525
- and I eat one of you, I'm sorry.
- I don't want another single,

918
01:18:56,550 --> 01:18:58,830
pop-culture reference outta you for
the rest of the trip. You understand?

919
01:18:58,854 --> 01:19:01,252
I'm trying to say that,
something is coming.

920
01:19:07,530 --> 01:19:09,358
Thanos!

921
01:19:29,433 --> 01:19:32,245
Whoa whoa whoa please don't
put your eggs in me!

922
01:19:33,065 --> 01:19:34,698
Stay down, clown!

923
01:19:40,628 --> 01:19:43,737
Die, Blanket of Death!

924
01:19:48,612 --> 01:19:52,252
Everybody stay where you
are, chill the F out...

925
01:19:52,870 --> 01:19:55,549
I'm gonna ask you
this one time...

926
01:19:55,574 --> 01:19:56,930
Where is Gamora?

927
01:19:56,955 --> 01:19:59,689
Yeah, I'll do you one better.
Who's Gamora?

928
01:19:59,714 --> 01:20:02,931
I'll do you one better!
Why is Gamora?

929
01:20:02,956 --> 01:20:05,954
Tell me where the girl is, or I swear to you, I'm
gonna french fry this little freak.

930
01:20:05,979 --> 01:20:09,621
Let's do it. Just shoot my guy and
I'll blast him. Let's go!

931
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:13,311
- Do it, Quill. I can take it.
- No, he can't take it.

932
01:20:13,336 --> 01:20:14,295
She's right. You can't.

933
01:20:14,395 --> 01:20:16,149
Oh yeah? You don't wanna
tell me where she is?

934
01:20:16,173 --> 01:20:20,087
That's fine. I'll kill all three of you
and I'll beat it out of Thanos myself!

935
01:20:20,112 --> 01:20:22,446
- Starting with you.
- Wait what, Thanos? All right...

936
01:20:22,462 --> 01:20:24,688
Let me ask you this one time...

937
01:20:24,713 --> 01:20:26,814
What master do you serve?

938
01:20:26,838 --> 01:20:30,238
What master do I serve? What,
am I supposed to say "Jesus"?

939
01:20:30,315 --> 01:20:32,504
- You're from Earth.
- I'm not from Earth. I'm from Missouri.

940
01:20:32,528 --> 01:20:35,113
Yeah, that's on Earth, dipshit.
What are you hassling us for?

941
01:20:35,138 --> 01:20:39,707
- So you're not with Thanos?
- With Thanos?

942
01:20:39,831 --> 01:20:42,580
No! I'm here to kill Thanos.

943
01:20:42,612 --> 01:20:44,407
He took my girl. Wait, who are you?

944
01:20:44,999 --> 01:20:46,712
We're the Avengers, man.

945
01:20:46,912 --> 01:20:50,434
- You're the ones Thor told us about!
- You know Thor?

946
01:20:50,808 --> 01:20:54,526
Yeah. Tall guy, not that
good-looking. Needed saving.

947
01:20:54,690 --> 01:20:57,533
Where is he now?

948
01:21:11,173 --> 01:21:13,065
This is the plan? We're gonna
hit him with a brick?

949
01:21:13,168 --> 01:21:14,884
It's a mold.

950
01:21:15,514 --> 01:21:19,835
A king's weapon. Meant to
be the greatest in Asgard.

951
01:21:20,429 --> 01:21:22,747
In theory, it could
even summon the Bifrost.

952
01:21:23,008 --> 01:21:24,687
Does it have a name?

953
01:21:25,972 --> 01:21:27,290
Stormbreaker.

954
01:21:27,455 --> 01:21:30,503
That's a bit much.

955
01:21:30,832 --> 01:21:33,152
So how do we make it?

956
01:21:33,913 --> 01:21:35,746
You'll have to restart the forge.

957
01:21:37,204 --> 01:21:40,483
Awaken the heart of a dying star.

958
01:21:41,824 --> 01:21:45,784
Rabbit, fire up the pod.

959
01:21:47,589 --> 01:21:50,128
What the hell happened
to this planet?

960
01:21:50,153 --> 01:21:51,914
It's 8 degrees off its axis.

961
01:21:52,005 --> 01:21:54,918
Gravitational pull is
all over the place.

962
01:21:55,589 --> 01:21:59,276
Yeah, we got one advantage.
He's coming to us.

963
01:21:59,316 --> 01:22:02,099
We'll use it. Alright,
I have a plan.

964
01:22:02,153 --> 01:22:03,453
Or at least the beginnings of one.

965
01:22:03,547 --> 01:22:06,187
It's pretty simple. We draw him in,
pin him down, get what we need.

966
01:22:06,394 --> 01:22:09,893
We definitely don't want to dance with
this guy, we just want the gauntlet.

967
01:22:09,918 --> 01:22:11,264
Are you yawning?

968
01:22:12,369 --> 01:22:14,549
In the middle of this, while
I'm breaking it down? Huh?

969
01:22:14,574 --> 01:22:16,285
Did you hear what I said?

970
01:22:16,371 --> 01:22:18,996
I stopped listening after you
said "we need a plan."

971
01:22:19,004 --> 01:22:20,029
Okay, Mr. Clean's
on his own page.

972
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:22,527
See, not winging it isn't
really what they do.

973
01:22:22,552 --> 01:22:24,723
What exactly is it that they do?

974
01:22:24,748 --> 01:22:27,919
- Kick names, take ass.
- Yeah. That's right.

975
01:22:34,277 --> 01:22:35,842
All right, just get over here, please?

976
01:22:36,391 --> 01:22:38,708
Mr. Lord,
can you get your folks to circle up?

977
01:22:38,733 --> 01:22:41,920
Mr. Lord?
Star-Lord is fine.

978
01:22:43,078 --> 01:22:44,255
We've gotta coalesce.

979
01:22:44,455 --> 01:22:46,328
Because if all we come at him
with is a plucky attitude...

980
01:22:46,336 --> 01:22:50,351
Dude, don't call us plucky.
We don't know what it means.

981
01:22:50,367 --> 01:22:54,226
All right, we're optimistic, yes.
I like your plan, except it sucks.

982
01:22:54,251 --> 01:22:57,665
So let me do the plan, and that
way, it might be really good.

983
01:22:57,690 --> 01:22:59,720
Tell him about the dance-off
to save the Universe.

984
01:22:59,732 --> 01:23:00,789
What dance-off?

985
01:23:00,889 --> 01:23:03,534
- It's not a, it's not a...
- Like in Footloose? The movie?

986
01:23:03,558 --> 01:23:07,237
Exactly like Footloose! Is it still
the greatest movie in history?

987
01:23:07,262 --> 01:23:09,580
- It never was.
- Don't encourage this, alright?

988
01:23:09,629 --> 01:23:12,410
- We're getting no help from Flash Gordon here.
- Flash Gordon?

989
01:23:12,435 --> 01:23:15,044
By the way? That's a compliment.
Don't forget.

990
01:23:15,075 --> 01:23:18,176
I'm half-human. So that
50% of me that's stupid,

991
01:23:18,378 --> 01:23:21,331
- That's 100% you.
- Your math is blowing my mind.

992
01:23:21,372 --> 01:23:22,784
Excuse me?

993
01:23:23,441 --> 01:23:27,628
But does your friend
often do that?

994
01:23:28,097 --> 01:23:31,112
Strange! We all right?

995
01:23:40,647 --> 01:23:44,217
- You're back. You all right? - I am.
- Hey, what was that?

996
01:23:44,242 --> 01:23:48,398
I went forward in time, to
view alternate futures.

997
01:23:48,703 --> 01:23:52,578
To see all the possible
outcomes of the coming conflict.

998
01:23:52,812 --> 01:23:56,687
- How many did you see?
- 14,000,605.

999
01:23:58,133 --> 01:24:00,953
How many do we win?

1000
01:24:04,561 --> 01:24:06,053
One.

1001
01:24:27,602 --> 01:24:30,860
The Stone had
better be up there.

1002
01:24:32,376 --> 01:24:35,946
For your sister's sake.

1003
01:24:55,322 --> 01:25:00,728
Welcome, Thanos, son of A'lars.

1004
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:05,517
Gamora, daughter of Thanos.

1005
01:25:05,641 --> 01:25:06,992
You know us?

1006
01:25:07,024 --> 01:25:11,828
It is my curse to know
all who journey here.

1007
01:25:11,915 --> 01:25:14,336
Where is the Soul Stone?

1008
01:25:14,361 --> 01:25:16,470
You should know,

1009
01:25:16,670 --> 01:25:20,142
it extracts a terrible price.

1010
01:25:21,032 --> 01:25:23,602
I'm prepared.

1011
01:25:25,266 --> 01:25:28,977
We all think that at first.

1012
01:25:32,079 --> 01:25:35,094
We are all wrong.

1013
01:25:45,865 --> 01:25:48,607
How is it you know
this place so well?

1014
01:25:48,632 --> 01:25:53,225
A lifetime ago, I, too,
sought the stones.

1015
01:25:53,257 --> 01:25:58,296
I even held one in my hand.
But it cast me out.

1016
01:25:58,351 --> 01:26:00,569
Banished me here.

1017
01:26:00,577 --> 01:26:04,827
Guiding others to a
treasure I cannot possess.

1018
01:26:12,973 --> 01:26:16,605
What you seek lies
in front of you.

1019
01:26:16,762 --> 01:26:19,964
As does what you fear.

1020
01:26:20,090 --> 01:26:23,441
- What's this?
- The price.

1021
01:26:23,527 --> 01:26:28,433
Soul holds a special place
among the Infinity Stones.

1022
01:26:29,094 --> 01:26:33,730
You might say it has
a certain wisdom.

1023
01:26:34,765 --> 01:26:36,505
Tell me what it needs.

1024
01:26:37,014 --> 01:26:40,273
To ensure that
whoever possesses it,

1025
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:43,781
understands its power...

1026
01:26:43,820 --> 01:26:47,711
The Stone demands a sacrifice.

1027
01:26:47,795 --> 01:26:49,335
Of what?

1028
01:26:49,535 --> 01:26:51,654
In order to take the Stone...

1029
01:26:51,686 --> 01:26:55,021
You must lose that
which you love.

1030
01:26:57,115 --> 01:27:01,654
A soul, for a soul.

1031
01:27:16,118 --> 01:27:19,297
All my life, I
dreamed of a day...

1032
01:27:19,352 --> 01:27:21,860
a moment...

1033
01:27:22,097 --> 01:27:24,949
when you got
what you deserved.

1034
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:29,659
And I was always
so disappointed.

1035
01:27:32,065 --> 01:27:34,197
But, now...

1036
01:27:37,432 --> 01:27:40,877
You kill, and torture,

1037
01:27:42,479 --> 01:27:45,642
and you call it mercy.

1038
01:27:48,424 --> 01:27:51,455
The Universe has judged you.

1039
01:27:52,391 --> 01:27:55,487
You asked it for a prize and

1040
01:27:55,687 --> 01:27:57,898
and it told you, no.

1041
01:27:58,469 --> 01:28:00,726
You failed.

1042
01:28:01,282 --> 01:28:03,891
And do you wanna know why?

1043
01:28:04,125 --> 01:28:06,105
Because you love nothing.

1044
01:28:06,741 --> 01:28:08,166
No one.

1045
01:28:19,338 --> 01:28:23,478
Really? Tears?

1046
01:28:23,635 --> 01:28:26,025
They are not for him.

1047
01:28:39,732 --> 01:28:41,810
No.

1048
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:44,957
This isn't love.

1049
01:28:44,982 --> 01:28:48,466
I ignored my destiny once.

1050
01:28:49,724 --> 01:28:51,998
I cannot do that again.

1051
01:28:52,653 --> 01:28:54,342
Even...

1052
01:28:54,602 --> 01:28:56,600
for you.

1053
01:29:20,062 --> 01:29:22,913
I'm sorry, little one.

1054
01:31:04,289 --> 01:31:07,664
Drop to 2,600. Heading 030.

1055
01:31:07,734 --> 01:31:09,489
I hope you're right about this,

1056
01:31:09,511 --> 01:31:12,578
or we're gonna land a lot
faster than you want to.

1057
01:31:27,956 --> 01:31:30,618
When you said we were going
to open Wakanda to the

1058
01:31:30,630 --> 01:31:33,198
rest of the world, this
is not what I imagined.

1059
01:31:33,206 --> 01:31:35,182
And what did you imagine?

1060
01:31:35,207 --> 01:31:38,963
The Olympics. Even a Starbucks.

1061
01:31:52,510 --> 01:31:55,838
- Should we bow?
- Yeah, he's a king.

1062
01:31:55,869 --> 01:31:58,994
Seems like I'm always
thanking you for something.

1063
01:31:59,673 --> 01:32:03,548
- What are you doing?
- We don't do that here.

1064
01:32:03,573 --> 01:32:06,145
So how big of an assault
should we expect?

1065
01:32:06,157 --> 01:32:08,799
Uh, sir. Sir, I think you should expect
quite a big assault.

1066
01:32:08,815 --> 01:32:11,580
- How are we looking?
- You will have my Kingsguard.

1067
01:32:11,620 --> 01:32:15,494
The Border Tribe, the Dora Milaje.
And...

1068
01:32:15,854 --> 01:32:19,463
A semi-stable 100-year old man.

1069
01:32:21,581 --> 01:32:23,260
How have you been, Buck?

1070
01:32:23,285 --> 01:32:26,749
Not bad, for the
end of the world.

1071
01:32:39,326 --> 01:32:41,896
The structure is polymorphic.

1072
01:32:41,935 --> 01:32:45,099
Right. We, we had to attach each
neuron non-sequentially.

1073
01:32:45,115 --> 01:32:50,185
Why didn't you just reprogram the
synapses to work collectively?

1074
01:32:50,294 --> 01:32:53,989
Because... we didn't think of it?

1075
01:32:54,005 --> 01:32:57,372
- I'm sure you did your best.
- Can you do it?

1076
01:32:57,551 --> 01:33:00,933
Yes, but there are more than
2 trillion neurons here.

1077
01:33:00,973 --> 01:33:04,597
One misalignment could cause a
cascade of circuit failures.

1078
01:33:04,668 --> 01:33:08,269
- It will take time, brother.
- How long?

1079
01:33:08,294 --> 01:33:11,340
As long as you can give me.

1080
01:33:14,380 --> 01:33:18,762
Something's entered
the atmosphere.

1081
01:33:33,304 --> 01:33:35,866
Hey Cap, we got a
situation here.

1082
01:33:45,039 --> 01:33:47,484
God, I love this place.

1083
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:52,155
Don't start celebrating yet, guys. We
got more incoming outside the dome.

1084
01:34:10,149 --> 01:34:13,854
It's too late. We need to
destroy the Stone now.

1085
01:34:13,879 --> 01:34:17,479
- Vision, get your ass back on the table.
- We will hold them off.

1086
01:34:17,481 --> 01:34:22,230
Wanda, as soon as that stone's out
of his head, you blow it to hell.

1087
01:34:22,255 --> 01:34:23,324
I will.

1088
01:34:23,371 --> 01:34:26,925
Evacuate the city,
engage all defenses...

1089
01:34:26,942 --> 01:34:30,433
and get this man a shield!

1090
01:34:38,821 --> 01:34:41,455
I don't think you get
the scientifics here.

1091
01:34:41,480 --> 01:34:44,270
These rings are gigantic.
You wanna get them moving,

1092
01:34:44,282 --> 01:34:46,714
you're gonna need something a
lot bigger to yank them loose!

1093
01:34:46,730 --> 01:34:48,847
- Leave that to me.
- Leave it to you?

1094
01:34:48,855 --> 01:34:52,909
Buddy, you're in space. All
you got is a rope and a...

1095
01:35:00,339 --> 01:35:02,908
Fire the engines!

1096
01:35:18,865 --> 01:35:22,341
More power, rabbit!

1097
01:35:53,028 --> 01:35:55,488
Well done, boy.

1098
01:35:56,122 --> 01:35:59,911
That's Nidavellir!

1099
01:36:18,688 --> 01:36:21,734
- Damn it.
- Damn it? What's damn it?

1100
01:36:21,759 --> 01:36:23,821
- The mechanism is crippled.
- What?

1101
01:36:23,836 --> 01:36:26,058
With the iris closed, I
can't heat the metal.

1102
01:36:26,083 --> 01:36:30,098
- How long will it take to heat it?
- A few minutes, maybe more. Why?

1103
01:36:32,011 --> 01:36:34,675
- I'm gonna hold it open.
- That's suicide.

1104
01:36:34,700 --> 01:36:37,817
So is facing Thanos
without that axe.

1105
01:36:46,577 --> 01:36:50,592
- How are we looking, Bruce?
- Yeah, I think I'm getting the hang of it.

1106
01:36:52,989 --> 01:36:57,895
Whoa, this is amazing, Nat! It's like
being the Hulk without actually...

1107
01:37:00,718 --> 01:37:02,499
I'm okay.
I'm okay!

1108
01:37:04,225 --> 01:37:07,959
I've got two heat signatures
breaking through the treeline.

1109
01:37:19,224 --> 01:37:22,224
- ([Now!])
- ([Yes!])

1110
01:37:25,001 --> 01:37:28,601
- Ya hoo hoo! Bafa! ([Fight to the death!])
- Ya hoo hoo! Bafa! ([Fight to the death!])

1111
01:37:28,716 --> 01:37:32,716
- Ya hoo hoo! Bafa! ([Fight to the death!])
- Ya hoo hoo! Bafa! ([Fight to the death!])
- Ya hoo hoo!

1112
01:37:34,892 --> 01:37:37,368
Thank you for standing with us.

1113
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:39,384
[Of course, brother.]

1114
01:37:59,075 --> 01:38:01,512
Where's the other friend?

1115
01:38:01,536 --> 01:38:04,395
You will pay for his
life with yours.

1116
01:38:04,809 --> 01:38:07,660
Thanos will have that stone.

1117
01:38:07,731 --> 01:38:09,198
That's not gonna happen.

1118
01:38:09,223 --> 01:38:11,754
You are in Wakanda now.

1119
01:38:11,794 --> 01:38:16,293
Thanos will have nothing
but dust, and blood.

1120
01:38:16,419 --> 01:38:18,093
We,

1121
01:38:18,293 --> 01:38:21,043
have blood to spare.

1122
01:38:31,793 --> 01:38:36,019
- Did they surrender?
- Not exactly.

1123
01:38:46,040 --> 01:38:48,371
- Yibambe! [Hold!]
- Yibambe! [Hold!]

1124
01:38:48,701 --> 01:38:50,978
- Yibambe! [Hold!]
- Yibambe! [Hold!]

1125
01:38:51,068 --> 01:38:53,268
- Yibambe! [Hold!]
- Yibambe! [Hold!]

1126
01:38:53,382 --> 01:38:54,882
- Yibambe! [Hold!]
- Yibambe! [Hold!]

1127
01:39:02,021 --> 01:39:04,809
What the hell?

1128
01:39:06,527 --> 01:39:09,261
Looks like we pissed her off.

1129
01:39:19,192 --> 01:39:21,840
They're killing themselves.

1130
01:39:31,981 --> 01:39:34,881
- [Shields!]
- [Shields!]

1131
01:39:38,487 --> 01:39:40,287
[Fire!]

1132
01:39:57,020 --> 01:39:58,533
You see the teeth on those things?

1133
01:39:58,545 --> 01:40:01,262
Alright, back up, Sam, or you're
gonna get your wings singed.

1134
01:40:13,117 --> 01:40:15,673
Cap, if these things circle the
perimeter and get in behind us,

1135
01:40:15,842 --> 01:40:17,593
there's nothing between
them and Vision.

1136
01:40:17,793 --> 01:40:19,719
Then we better keep
them in front of us.

1137
01:40:19,744 --> 01:40:22,140
How do we do that?

1138
01:40:23,388 --> 01:40:25,576
We open the barrier.

1139
01:40:27,188 --> 01:40:31,634
On my signal, open
northwest section 17.

1140
01:40:31,682 --> 01:40:33,961
<i>Requesting confirmation, my King.</i>

1141
01:40:33,971 --> 01:40:35,853
<i>You said open the barrier?</i>

1142
01:40:35,862 --> 01:40:39,494
- On my signal.
- This will be the end of Wakanda.

1143
01:40:40,088 --> 01:40:44,470
Then it will be the noblest
ending in history.

1144
01:40:45,087 --> 01:40:48,287
Foola! [Drop shields!]

1145
01:40:56,588 --> 01:40:58,416
Wakanda forever!

1146
01:40:58,627 --> 01:41:00,525
Wakanda forever!

1147
01:41:10,775 --> 01:41:11,818
Now!

1148
01:41:42,108 --> 01:41:45,081
- How much longer, Shuri?
- I've barely begun, brother.

1149
01:41:45,239 --> 01:41:47,831
You might want to
pick up the pace.

1150
01:41:54,099 --> 01:41:56,216
All fathers, give me strength.

1151
01:41:56,241 --> 01:41:57,618
You understand, boy?

1152
01:41:57,933 --> 01:42:01,366
You're about to take the
full force of a star.

1153
01:42:02,022 --> 01:42:04,022
It'll kill you.

1154
01:42:04,241 --> 01:42:06,733
Only if I die.

1155
01:42:06,772 --> 01:42:11,811
Yes, that's what
killing you means.

1156
01:42:38,722 --> 01:42:41,511
Hold it, hold it, Thor!

1157
01:43:30,904 --> 01:43:33,997
Thor? Say something, come on.

1158
01:43:34,256 --> 01:43:36,950
Thor, you okay?

1159
01:43:40,466 --> 01:43:44,801
- I think he's dying.
- He needs the axe.

1160
01:43:45,535 --> 01:43:48,253
Where's the handle?

1161
01:43:49,855 --> 01:43:53,527
Tree! Help me find the handle.

1162
01:45:01,170 --> 01:45:03,154
There's too many of them!

1163
01:45:30,656 --> 01:45:33,352
You guys are so screwed now!

1164
01:45:36,594 --> 01:45:39,820
Bring me Thanos!

1165
01:46:11,297 --> 01:46:13,133
Oh, yeah.

1166
01:46:15,752 --> 01:46:19,065
You're much more of a Thanos.

1167
01:46:20,197 --> 01:46:23,205
I take it the Maw is dead?

1168
01:46:24,306 --> 01:46:27,680
This day extracts a heavy toll.

1169
01:46:28,822 --> 01:46:31,501
Still, he accomplished
his mission.

1170
01:46:31,509 --> 01:46:33,047
You may regret that.

1171
01:46:33,247 --> 01:46:37,298
He brought you face-to-face with
the Master of the Mystic Arts.

1172
01:46:39,821 --> 01:46:42,954
Where do you think
he brought you?

1173
01:46:42,998 --> 01:46:47,208
Let me guess.
Your home?

1174
01:46:50,483 --> 01:46:52,382
It was.

1175
01:46:54,382 --> 01:46:57,382
And it was beautiful.

1176
01:46:58,374 --> 01:47:00,573
Titan was like most planets.

1177
01:47:00,773 --> 01:47:03,882
Too many mouths,
not enough to go around.

1178
01:47:03,905 --> 01:47:08,022
And when we faced extinction,
I offered a solution.

1179
01:47:08,108 --> 01:47:10,272
Genocide?

1180
01:47:10,297 --> 01:47:14,617
At random. Dispassionate, fair.
The rich and poor alike.

1181
01:47:15,273 --> 01:47:18,093
And they called me a madman.

1182
01:47:18,235 --> 01:47:22,437
And what I predicted,
came to pass.

1183
01:47:23,423 --> 01:47:25,768
Congratulations. You're a prophet.

1184
01:47:26,111 --> 01:47:27,501
I'm a survivor.

1185
01:47:27,517 --> 01:47:29,946
Who wants to murder trillions.

1186
01:47:30,025 --> 01:47:34,032
With all six Stones, I could
simply snap my fingers.

1187
01:47:34,095 --> 01:47:39,230
And they would all cease to exist.
I call that mercy.

1188
01:47:40,582 --> 01:47:43,371
And then what?

1189
01:47:43,660 --> 01:47:45,408
I finally rest.

1190
01:47:45,608 --> 01:47:49,488
And watch the sun rise
on a grateful universe.

1191
01:47:50,137 --> 01:47:54,355
The hardest choices require
the strongest wills.

1192
01:47:54,645 --> 01:48:00,504
I think you'll find our
will equal to yours.

1193
01:48:00,824 --> 01:48:02,753
"Our"?

1194
01:48:07,696 --> 01:48:12,399
- Piece of cake, Quill.
- Yeah, if your goal was to piss him off!

1195
01:48:49,745 --> 01:48:51,674
Boom!

1196
01:48:52,143 --> 01:48:54,643
Don't let him close his fist.

1197
01:48:58,229 --> 01:49:01,494
Magic! More magic!

1198
01:49:01,729 --> 01:49:02,864
Magic with a kick!

1199
01:49:03,186 --> 01:49:05,217
Magic with a...

1200
01:49:05,458 --> 01:49:07,239
Insect.

1201
01:49:44,387 --> 01:49:46,815
- Well, well.
- You should have killed me.

1202
01:49:46,977 --> 01:49:50,125
It would've been a
waste of parts!

1203
01:49:54,056 --> 01:49:56,603
Where's Gamora?

1204
01:50:36,256 --> 01:50:37,716
Is he under? Don't let up.

1205
01:50:37,741 --> 01:50:40,553
Be quick. He is very strong.

1206
01:50:40,569 --> 01:50:44,478
Parker, help. Get over here. She
can't hold him much longer. Let's go.

1207
01:50:50,047 --> 01:50:51,703
We gotta open his
fist to get it off.

1208
01:50:51,727 --> 01:50:54,447
I thought you'd be hard to catch.
For the record, this was my plan.

1209
01:50:55,365 --> 01:50:57,146
Not so strong now, huh?

1210
01:50:57,584 --> 01:51:00,083
Where's Gamora?

1211
01:51:00,278 --> 01:51:03,801
- My Gamora!
- No, bullshit!

1212
01:51:03,833 --> 01:51:06,223
Where is she?

1213
01:51:06,270 --> 01:51:09,496
- He is in anguish.
- Good.

1214
01:51:10,402 --> 01:51:11,402
He...

1215
01:51:11,427 --> 01:51:13,150
He mourns.

1216
01:51:13,174 --> 01:51:17,549
What does this monster
have to mourn?

1217
01:51:17,822 --> 01:51:19,783
Gamora...

1218
01:51:22,369 --> 01:51:23,837
What?

1219
01:51:23,861 --> 01:51:30,790
He took her to Vormir. He came back
with the Soul Stone. She didn't.

1220
01:51:31,906 --> 01:51:35,913
Okay, Quill? You gotta cool
it right now, understand?

1221
01:51:36,382 --> 01:51:39,772
Don't, don't. Don't engage.
We almost got this off!

1222
01:51:40,905 --> 01:51:44,186
Tell me she's lying.

1223
01:51:44,350 --> 01:51:47,780
Asshole! Tell me
you didn't do it.

1224
01:51:48,834 --> 01:51:52,513
I had to.

1225
01:51:52,715 --> 01:51:55,716
No you didn't.

1226
01:51:58,669 --> 01:52:02,130
- No! No, you didn't!
- Quill!

1227
01:52:02,279 --> 01:52:04,292
Kid, stop! Stop, stop!
Stop, stop!

1228
01:52:04,292 --> 01:52:07,657
It's coming, it's coming!
I got it, I got it!

1229
01:52:10,175 --> 01:52:12,253
Oh, God.

1230
01:53:10,339 --> 01:53:13,870
Come and get some, space-dogs!

1231
01:53:15,964 --> 01:53:20,401
Come on! Get some, get some!
Get some, come on, get some!

1232
01:53:21,151 --> 01:53:23,924
- How much for the gun?
- Not for sale.

1233
01:53:23,971 --> 01:53:26,674
Okay, how much for the arm?

1234
01:53:27,565 --> 01:53:30,127
Oh, I'll get that arm.

1235
01:53:38,438 --> 01:53:42,031
- New haircut?
- I notice you've copied my beard.

1236
01:53:43,750 --> 01:53:46,195
Oh, by the way, this is a
friend of mine. A tree.

1237
01:53:46,220 --> 01:53:48,774
I am Groot!

1238
01:53:49,384 --> 01:53:51,774
I am Steve Rogers.

1239
01:54:10,958 --> 01:54:13,949
Fall back! Fall back now!

1240
01:54:22,314 --> 01:54:24,899
Focus that fire on the
left flank, Sam.

1241
01:54:24,924 --> 01:54:27,040
I'm doing it.

1242
01:54:49,709 --> 01:54:51,974
Why was she up there
all this time?

1243
01:54:52,029 --> 01:54:55,490
She's on the field. Take it.

1244
01:55:26,297 --> 01:55:29,734
Guys, we got a Vision
situation here.

1245
01:55:31,633 --> 01:55:34,750
- Somebody get to Vision!
- I got him.

1246
01:55:34,775 --> 01:55:36,282
On my way.

1247
01:55:41,031 --> 01:55:43,968
He'll die alone. As will you.

1248
01:55:43,976 --> 01:55:45,937
She's not alone.

1249
01:56:11,328 --> 01:56:13,335
Oh, no. Oh, no, you don't.

1250
01:56:13,360 --> 01:56:15,507
This isn't gonna be like
New York, pal. This

1251
01:56:15,519 --> 01:56:17,774
suit's already kicked the
crap outta the Hulk.

1252
01:56:22,198 --> 01:56:25,526
Guys. Vision needs back-up now.

1253
01:56:26,736 --> 01:56:30,462
Hulk? Hulk? I know you like making your
entrance at the last second.

1254
01:56:30,470 --> 01:56:34,501
Well this is it, man. This is
the last, last second.

1255
01:56:37,657 --> 01:56:41,407
Hulk! Hulk!
Shit, Hulk!

1256
01:56:42,001 --> 01:56:47,735
- No!
- Oh, screw you, you big, green asshole!

1257
01:56:47,743 --> 01:56:51,305
I'll do it myself. Come on.

1258
01:57:03,980 --> 01:57:06,151
See ya!

1259
01:57:16,779 --> 01:57:19,677
Hulk, we got a lot
to figure out, pal.

1260
01:57:30,367 --> 01:57:32,687
I thought you were formidable, machine.

1261
01:57:33,547 --> 01:57:36,197
But you're dying like any man.

1262
01:57:44,479 --> 01:57:46,564
Get outta here!

1263
01:57:49,276 --> 01:57:51,205
Go!

1264
01:58:08,760 --> 01:58:10,939
That was really gross.

1265
01:58:37,527 --> 01:58:40,269
I thought I told you to go.

1266
01:58:40,347 --> 01:58:43,042
We don't trade lives, Captain.

1267
01:58:53,186 --> 01:58:55,889
I got you, I got you!

1268
01:58:55,920 --> 01:58:58,670
Sorry I can't remember
anybody's names.

1269
01:59:43,095 --> 01:59:45,946
You're full of tricks, wizard.

1270
01:59:46,439 --> 01:59:51,228
But you never once used
your greatest weapon.

1271
01:59:52,738 --> 01:59:54,933
A fake.

1272
02:00:01,887 --> 02:00:05,676
You throw another moon at
me, and I'm gonna lose it.

1273
02:00:05,746 --> 02:00:08,168
- Stark.
- You know me?

1274
02:00:08,644 --> 02:00:13,472
I do. You're not the only
one cursed with knowledge.

1275
02:00:14,222 --> 02:00:16,370
My only curse is you.

1276
02:00:46,826 --> 02:00:50,216
All that for a drop of blood.

1277
02:01:32,881 --> 02:01:35,450
You have my respect, Stark.

1278
02:01:36,412 --> 02:01:40,466
When I'm done, half of
humanity will still be alive.

1279
02:01:45,161 --> 02:01:48,309
I hope they remember you.

1280
02:01:57,311 --> 02:01:59,303
Stop.

1281
02:02:04,694 --> 02:02:09,654
Spare his life, and I
will give you the Stone.

1282
02:02:12,253 --> 02:02:14,768
No tricks.

1283
02:02:18,526 --> 02:02:20,588
Don't!

1284
02:03:11,049 --> 02:03:13,314
One to go.

1285
02:03:22,540 --> 02:03:24,969
Where is he?

1286
02:03:32,817 --> 02:03:35,918
Did we just lose?

1287
02:03:38,255 --> 02:03:41,363
Why would you do that?

1288
02:03:43,040 --> 02:03:46,438
We're in the endgame now.

1289
02:03:50,168 --> 02:03:52,768
Ooo! Bafa!

1290
02:03:53,310 --> 02:03:56,877
- Ya hoo hoo ([We come!])
- Bafa! ([To die!]) - Ya hoo hoo!

1291
02:04:11,488 --> 02:04:13,808
Are you okay?

1292
02:04:14,730 --> 02:04:17,948
What? What is it?

1293
02:04:19,003 --> 02:04:21,433
He's here.

1294
02:04:31,370 --> 02:04:36,112
Everyone on my position.
We have incoming.

1295
02:04:36,971 --> 02:04:40,002
What the hell?

1296
02:05:05,143 --> 02:05:08,432
Cap. That's him.

1297
02:05:09,931 --> 02:05:13,665
Eyes up. Stay sharp.

1298
02:05:37,323 --> 02:05:40,401
Wanda. It's time.

1299
02:05:40,440 --> 02:05:41,534
No.

1300
02:05:41,734 --> 02:05:43,846
They can't stop him,
Wanda. But we can.

1301
02:05:43,893 --> 02:05:47,128
Look at me. You have the
power to destroy the stone.

1302
02:05:47,153 --> 02:05:50,041
- Don't.
- You must do it Wanda. Please...

1303
02:05:51,208 --> 02:05:54,560
We are out of time.

1304
02:05:54,585 --> 02:05:59,194
- I can't.
- Yes, you can. You can.

1305
02:06:00,493 --> 02:06:04,524
If he gets this stone,
half the Universe dies.

1306
02:06:05,055 --> 02:06:06,441
It's not fair.

1307
02:06:07,895 --> 02:06:10,711
It shouldn't be you,
but it is.

1308
02:06:11,438 --> 02:06:12,960
It's all right.

1309
02:06:13,919 --> 02:06:16,633
You could never hurt me.

1310
02:06:25,069 --> 02:06:28,420
I just feel you.

1311
02:08:06,135 --> 02:08:08,345
I love you.

1312
02:08:37,104 --> 02:08:39,900
I understand, my child.

1313
02:08:40,581 --> 02:08:43,550
Better than anyone.

1314
02:08:43,847 --> 02:08:46,206
You could never.

1315
02:08:50,633 --> 02:08:54,515
Today, I lost more
than you can know.

1316
02:08:55,359 --> 02:08:58,944
But now is no time to mourn.

1317
02:09:00,211 --> 02:09:02,140
Now...

1318
02:09:02,211 --> 02:09:05,781
is no time at all.

1319
02:09:27,727 --> 02:09:30,492
No!

1320
02:10:26,587 --> 02:10:29,149
I told you...

1321
02:10:29,368 --> 02:10:33,094
You'd die for that.

1322
02:10:45,865 --> 02:10:48,256
You should have...

1323
02:10:49,919 --> 02:10:52,574
You...

1324
02:10:53,684 --> 02:10:57,785
You should have
gone for the head!

1325
02:10:59,170 --> 02:11:01,560
No!

1326
02:11:33,245 --> 02:11:35,682
Daughter?

1327
02:11:42,168 --> 02:11:44,410
Did you do it?

1328
02:11:45,502 --> 02:11:47,908
Yes.

1329
02:11:54,919 --> 02:11:57,817
What did it cost?

1330
02:12:00,011 --> 02:12:03,136
Everything.

1331
02:12:11,990 --> 02:12:13,958
What did you do?

1332
02:12:14,888 --> 02:12:17,512
What did you do?!

1333
02:12:29,966 --> 02:12:32,153
Where did he go?

1334
02:12:34,544 --> 02:12:36,591
Thor...

1335
02:12:38,654 --> 02:12:40,263
Where did he go?

1336
02:12:40,365 --> 02:12:42,622
Steve?

1337
02:13:16,331 --> 02:13:18,501
Up, General, up!

1338
02:13:19,294 --> 02:13:20,830
This is no place to die.

1339
02:13:32,821 --> 02:13:34,921
Wakan? ([Great Spirit?])

1340
02:13:35,772 --> 02:13:37,842
I am Groot.

1341
02:13:37,866 --> 02:13:39,123
No.

1342
02:13:39,936 --> 02:13:44,279
No. No. No. No! Groot...

1343
02:13:44,567 --> 02:13:46,535
No...

1344
02:13:59,015 --> 02:14:01,741
Sam?

1345
02:14:04,273 --> 02:14:07,780
Sam, where you at?

1346
02:14:15,120 --> 02:14:18,635
Something's happening.

1347
02:14:29,415 --> 02:14:31,899
Quill?

1348
02:14:38,004 --> 02:14:41,511
- Steady, Quill.
- Oh, man.

1349
02:14:44,707 --> 02:14:46,402
Tony.

1350
02:14:49,184 --> 02:14:53,246
There was no other way.

1351
02:14:57,573 --> 02:14:59,682
Mr. Stark?

1352
02:15:02,831 --> 02:15:06,377
I don't feel so good.

1353
02:15:06,557 --> 02:15:10,479
- You're all right.
- I don't, I don't know what's happening...

1354
02:15:11,697 --> 02:15:15,103
I don't wanna go. I don't wanna go.
Sir, please...

1355
02:15:15,128 --> 02:15:17,861
Please. I don't wanna go.
I don't wanna go.

1356
02:15:21,929 --> 02:15:25,093
I'm sorry.

1357
02:15:38,247 --> 02:15:40,716
He did it.

1358
02:16:04,481 --> 02:16:08,372
What is this? What the
hell is happening?

1359
02:16:24,640 --> 02:16:27,499
Oh, God.
