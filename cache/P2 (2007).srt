(Song "Santa Baby")

2
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:31,442
(Angela) Yes. I redrafted the contracts
to include the new stipulations.

3
00:02:31,525 --> 00:02:34,027
(Man on phone) Then where are they?
- I'm faxing the revisions now.

4
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:37,572
Did you make all the changes I asked for?
- Yes, II included the 4 % increase...

5
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:41,243
and the extra two million.
- No. If it's a 4 % increase,

6
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,704
then you have to add
at least three million dollars.

7
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:46,916
No. That's not what I was told.
- And who told you that?

8
00:02:46,999 --> 00:02:49,084
Their lawyers.
- They're all idiots.

9
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:53,422
This is a total lack of communication.
- You know what? It's ok.

10
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:56,592
I had no way of knowing, sir.
- Ok, look. This is what I need you to do.

11
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,803
Sir, can I put you on hold for a second?
- Ok.

12
00:02:58,886 --> 00:03:00,888
Thanks. Hi, Jody.

13
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:04,265
Mr. Harper wants to see you in his office.
- Great. Of course.

14
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,644
You still want me to fax those?
- It's ok. You don't have to.

15
00:03:07,728 --> 00:03:10,063
I'm not even done yet. You should go home.
- Are you sure?

16
00:03:10,147 --> 00:03:13,733
Yeah. It's late. I don't want your parents
to worry. Get out of here.

17
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:18,197
Ok. Merry Christmas, Angela.
- Merry Christmas, Jody.

18
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:27,039
(Cell phone)

19
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:32,169
Hi, Lorraine.
Yeah, of course I'm going to make it.

20
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:35,256
Just let me call you back. Ok?

21
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:38,676
In a few minutes. I promise. OK.

22
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:44,594
Still on the Morgan deal, hm?
- What can I do for you, Jim?

23
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:46,684
I...

24
00:03:49,353 --> 00:03:52,356
I don't know how to...

25
00:03:53,065 --> 00:03:56,318
Angela,
I feel terrible about what happened.

26
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:59,696
It's ok. It's fine.
Let's just not worry about it, ok?

27
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,657
No, no, no. It's not ok.

28
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:06,912
I acted like a real jerk.
I'd had too many drinks and...

29
00:04:07,246 --> 00:04:10,415
you know
how these Christmas party's can be.

30
00:04:10,499 --> 00:04:13,627
You know we had a baby last year.

31
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:18,507
And it's been a hard year.
- I'm sure that it has.

32
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:23,091
I simply want to tell you
that I'm just really, really sorry. Ok?

33
00:04:23,929 --> 00:04:26,097
Apology accepted.

34
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:28,893
Ok. Thanks.

35
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:32,271
Merry Christmas, Angela.
- You too, Jim.

36
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:48,245
(Lorraine) You calling me from work?
I thought you were going home first.

37
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:52,829
I brought everything with me. Don't worry.
- God, I am so late with this dinner.

38
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,752
Did you pick up the Santa Claus costume?
I hope you didn't forget it.

39
00:04:55,836 --> 00:04:58,296
I didn't forget it. It's in the car.

40
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,632
I think Dad is more excited than the kids.

41
00:05:00,716 --> 00:05:03,969
Believe me, I can't wait
to get out of here and see you guys.

42
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:07,806
(Lorraine) Jimmy, Put that back.
Do you want Santa to come tonight or not?

43
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:11,727
(Jimmy) Hey, Mommy. I want Santa to come.
- Well, then help me set the table.

44
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,980
Ok. Please don't be late.
- I won't. I promise. I won't.

45
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,775
Ok, bye.
- Bye.

46
00:05:22,404 --> 00:05:23,571
Ok.

47
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,720
(Music)

48
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,531
Jesus!
- My God.

49
00:06:06,073 --> 00:06:08,200
Sorry, Angela.

50
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:11,411
I was just locking up the floors.
I didn't know anybody would be working...

51
00:06:11,495 --> 00:06:13,705
this late on Christmas Eve.
- Yeah, me neither.

52
00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:18,001
Sorry. I'll come back later, alright?
- Actually, if you wouldn't mind waiting,

53
00:06:18,085 --> 00:06:21,129
I'll lock up my office
and I'll take the elevator down with you.

54
00:06:21,213 --> 00:06:23,506
Ok. Sure.
- Ok. Two seconds.

55
00:06:25,092 --> 00:06:27,094
Do you work all night?
- Yeah.

56
00:06:27,177 --> 00:06:30,221
But they're closing the building
for the next three days.

57
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,391
Besides, I get New Year's Eve off.
- Oh, that's good.

58
00:06:32,474 --> 00:06:35,518
Yeah, I hope to get home in time
for the girls to open up the presents.

59
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,688
How are they?
- Great.

60
00:06:38,105 --> 00:06:42,317
Come on, your parents can't stand me.
- You're wrong, Doug. They love you.

61
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:46,446
So, where are you going this evening?
- To my sister's house in Jersey.

62
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:50,575
Jersey? I thought of you more
as an Upper East Side girl.

63
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:55,080
Yeah, upper east side of Maine, actually.
I grew up on a farm, Karl.

64
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:59,084
Now I'm having trouble believing that.
- Don't let the fancy clothes fool you.

65
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:03,255
I keep it real. Come on.
(Karl) If that's what you call it, ok.

66
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:06,800
Keeping it real.
- Good night, Karl.

67
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:09,261
Merry Christmas, Angela.
- You too. I'll see you soon.

68
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:10,471
Yeah.

69
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,848
(Cell phone)

70
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:24,818
Yes. No. I promise you.
I'm leaving right now. I know. I know.

71
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:29,402
I'm sorry, but I'm in the elevator.
25 minutes tops.

72
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:34,911
I can't hear you. What?
Lorraine, you're breaking up.

73
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:36,871
Hello?

74
00:08:36,223 --> 00:08:40,393
You've got to be kidding me.
You've got to be kidding. Ok.

75
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,605
(Car does not get started)

76
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,696
Come on. Come on. Come on!

77
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:56,577
Oh God. What am I going to do?

78
00:08:57,327 --> 00:08:59,412
(Door is being closed)

79
00:09:07,546 --> 00:09:11,716
I'm going to get out of the car.
That's what I'm going to do.

80
00:09:33,989 --> 00:09:35,031
Shit.

81
00:09:50,297 --> 00:09:51,589
Hello?

82
00:09:53,842 --> 00:09:56,678
Jesus.
- Rocky. Rocky. Rocky.

83
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:59,431
What are you doing? Heel. Stay.

84
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:00,599
Down. Down.

85
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:04,811
Sorry about that.
- That's ok.

86
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:08,607
Look, can you unlock the door
to the elevator room? My car won't start.

87
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:12,443
And I need to get upstairs and get a cab.
- Yeah, I can.

88
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:15,989
I just have to find my key cards. Sorry.

89
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:19,159
Where are those darn keys?
I was about to do my rounds, anyway. So...

90
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:21,662
Ok.
- What happened to your car?

91
00:10:21,745 --> 00:10:24,831
I have no idea.
- You probably left the lights on.

92
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:27,918
No, I don't think so. I'm usually
pretty good about that kind of thing.

93
00:10:28,001 --> 00:10:30,128
People do it all the time.
It's instinctive.

94
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:34,424
I mean, you drive down here and it's dark.
It happens. Ah. Here we go.

95
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,593
Great.
- You know, actually, I just thought.

96
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:40,430
I have a charger in the back, so if it is
your battery we could probably...

97
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:43,183
You could use that.
- Oh, thank you.

98
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:47,187
But I really should just take a cab.
I'm so late as it is. - I don't know.

99
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:51,358
It'll probably take longer to get a cab.
It's Christmas Eve, so, I don't know.

100
00:10:51,441 --> 00:10:55,941
It's up to you. Whatever you want.
- How long will it take?

101
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:59,908
Just a few minutes. Give me one second.
(Reporter on TV) It doesn't look...

102
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,828
like New Yorkers are actually going to be
able to celebrate a white Christmas.

103
00:11:02,911 --> 00:11:05,955
Maybe next year. Now, with the beautiful
metropolitan opera in the background,

104
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:09,000
let's check out the temperatures
for the tri-state area...

105
00:11:09,084 --> 00:11:12,504
Alright. Which way to your car?
- Over there.

106
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:13,755
Ok.

107
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:20,470
(Thomas) Working late, hm?
Yeah, I know how you feel.

108
00:11:21,221 --> 00:11:25,433
Yeah, these are pretty reliable cars
for the most part, right?

109
00:11:25,809 --> 00:11:28,812
They're supposed to be.

110
00:11:29,354 --> 00:11:31,606
Right. Positive.

111
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,360
Negative.

112
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:42,617
Ok, alright. Try it. Turn her over.
- Ok.

113
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:45,829
Strange.

114
00:11:46,246 --> 00:11:49,999
Ok. Hang on.
Can you turn your headlights on?

115
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:54,880
Weird. Try turning the keys again.

116
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,968
Damned.
- Ok. I guess turn the headlights off.

117
00:12:00,385 --> 00:12:02,470
You know what? That's it.

118
00:12:02,554 --> 00:12:06,015
I...
You've been a great help, but I give up.

119
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,394
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
I don't know what happened.

120
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:12,647
I thought I could do something about it.
- That's ok. You've been great.

121
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:17,231
Can you just let me in the elevator room?
- I was just trying to help.

122
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:20,864
I know, and I appreciate it. Thank you.

123
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:33,126
Hey, listen, I know you're upset
about your car not starting,

124
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:36,087
but it's the holidays, you know?
It's time to be thankful.

125
00:12:36,171 --> 00:12:40,341
No. You know what? You're right.
I should be thankful.

126
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:48,558
I...

127
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,563
I prepared
a small Christmas meal for myself.

128
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:56,858
You could join me if you want.

129
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:04,282
I'm just kidding.
- Oh, yeah. Sorry. I'm exhausted.

130
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,910
But really, thanks for your help.

131
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:10,872
Oh, you're welcome.
Maybe some other time, yeah?

132
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,248
Yeah, sure.

133
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,460
Alright. Here you go.

134
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:18,838
You don't want me to call you a cab?
- No. I've got a number in my bag.

135
00:13:18,922 --> 00:13:22,050
Alright, suit yourself. Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

136
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,185
(Song "Silent Night")

137
00:13:41,653 --> 00:13:42,695
Karl?

138
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:07,929
Hi. Can I get a car
at 2370 Park Avenue, please?

139
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:12,767
Are you sure? No, that's ok.
I'll wait. Thanks.

140
00:14:23,862 --> 00:14:26,823
Hey, Lorraine.
You're not going to believe what happened.

141
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:31,407
No. Actually, my car wouldn't start.
Look, just start without me.

142
00:14:32,871 --> 00:14:36,082
I'll be there within the hour
and I'll make it up to them.

143
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,960
Ok. I'll see you soon. Bye.

144

(Music)

145
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:33,056
(Cell phone)

146
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:35,808
Hello?

147
00:15:36,309 --> 00:15:39,312
Oh, oh, great. Thank you. Thank you.

148
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,356
Ok. Ok.

149
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,324
Oh, come on. What?

150
00:15:53,618 --> 00:15:56,746
This is not happening. Is this a joke?

151
00:15:56,955 --> 00:16:01,455
No, no. You've got to be kidding me.
Karl? Karl, where are you?

152
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:05,880
Is anybody here?
Come on, come on, come on.

153
00:16:14,806 --> 00:16:16,057
What?

154
00:16:17,392 --> 00:16:21,562
Just one second. Ok?
I'll be right back. One second.

155
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:44,710
Hello. Can you hear me? Look,
I've got a cab waiting for me out front.

156
00:16:44,794 --> 00:16:48,047
Can you open the front gate, please?
Hello?

157
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,675
(Horn is honking)

158
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,762
No. No. No, no, no, no. No.

159
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,932
No. Damned.

160
00:16:57,015 --> 00:17:00,018
Why would you leave me here?

161
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:09,903
Wake up, damned. The cab just left.

162
00:17:31,132 --> 00:17:34,135
Hey! I'm still in here. Wait!

163
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:48,983
Great.

164
00:17:57,909 --> 00:17:59,702
It's ok. Just...

165
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,631
Hello?

166
00:18:14,926 --> 00:18:17,762
Ok. Stop being paranoid.

167
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:21,599
Just go down to the office.

168
00:19:02,223 --> 00:19:03,307
Hello?

169
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:21,159
Ah. Oh, fuck!

170
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,453
Goddamned!

171
00:19:52,607 --> 00:19:54,692
(Angela is screaming)

172
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,280
(Angela)
No!

173
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:30,311
(Song "I like you for Christmas")

174
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:49,581
Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.
You've been a good little girl.

175
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:58,714
Oh, it's ok. It's ok. You're alright.
You're alright. You're alright. Ok?

176
00:20:58,798 --> 00:20:59,965
Alright?

177
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:05,926
You're not looking so good. Are you ok?
Take it easy. It's ok.

178
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:12,937
What happened to me? What time is it?

179
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:16,149
You just fell. You'll be alright.

180
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:20,486
I don't feel good. I'm going to be sick.
- I'll get some water.

181
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:25,070
I'll get you some water.
- Watch out! Be careful!

182
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:30,951
You're going to hurt yourself.
Try and stay calm. Oh, oh.

183
00:21:31,539 --> 00:21:32,581
Ok.

184
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:37,754
It's ok. It's ok. Here. Here.

185
00:21:38,296 --> 00:21:40,381
Ok? Alright?

186
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:44,927
I'm going to help you up. Ok, now?
I'm going to help you up.

187
00:21:45,011 --> 00:21:47,722
Here you go. Ready?

188
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:51,684
Alright. Here you go. It's ok.

189
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:54,979
Alright. Ok. Try to relax.

190
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:58,233
I'm going to clean this up. Ok.

191
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:10,244
Clean this up. Ok. Ok.

192
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:21,381
Alright. I'll be right back.

193
00:22:34,769 --> 00:22:35,936
Hungry?

194
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:38,731
I got turkey,

195
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:44,316
mashed potatoes. I got cranberries
and I even got some cornbread.

196
00:22:47,448 --> 00:22:50,576
Oh man. I am... I'm sorry about this.

197
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:54,997
I was just teasing.
I didn't mean to scare you.

198
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:57,458
Oh man.

199
00:22:59,043 --> 00:23:02,046
I hope it's still warm.

200
00:23:05,466 --> 00:23:08,594
If not I have the microwave, so...

201
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:12,849
Are you feeling any better?

202
00:23:13,933 --> 00:23:16,936
What happened to my clothes?

203
00:23:18,354 --> 00:23:22,524
Like I said, you fell,
and your clothes got dirty, so...

204
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:29,574
Maybe you'd like some wine.

205
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:34,412
It'll help you relax a little, you know?
- Look, I don't know what you're doing,

206
00:23:34,495 --> 00:23:37,623
but you'd better just fucking untie me.

207
00:23:41,252 --> 00:23:45,464
This is a California wine.
It's a Sonoma County.

208
00:23:45,965 --> 00:23:50,010
That's where I'm from.
It's beautiful up there.

209
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:55,892
Where are you from?

210
00:23:58,561 --> 00:24:02,731
What do you want?
- I want to know where you're from.

211
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:07,779
I'm from Readfield.

212
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:13,617
Where's that?
- Why don't you tell me what you want?

213
00:24:14,118 --> 00:24:18,618
I just want to know where Readfield is.
And I want you to relax.

214
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:37,141
Cheers.

215
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:41,229
Ok. I'll make a toast.

216
00:24:41,312 --> 00:24:45,812
Here's to good friends and hometowns
and Readfield, wherever that is.

217
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,116
Listen.

218
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:56,077
Tom.
- Tom.

219
00:24:57,578 --> 00:25:01,999
I have some place to be.
You know, I have obligations.

220
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:05,211
Yeah. I know.

221
00:25:05,294 --> 00:25:09,131
Way too many. You don't make time
for yourself, you know?

222
00:25:09,215 --> 00:25:13,260
You don't need
to be at everyone's beck and call.

223
00:25:14,929 --> 00:25:19,099
So, then maybe we should get a drink
in the new year.

224
00:25:20,476 --> 00:25:24,229
Now, look.
I've already prepared everything.

225
00:25:24,313 --> 00:25:28,108
It's all here.
- I know, and it looks really good.

226
00:25:28,192 --> 00:25:31,195
Yeah? Great. Well let's eat.

227
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,700
I'm starving.
- Tom, this is really sweet of you.

228
00:25:35,783 --> 00:25:39,077
And I mean that, but my whole family's
expecting me. I have plans.

229
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:42,915
I guess some plans are made to be broken.

230
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:48,129
Do you want to say grace, or should 1?

231
00:25:50,673 --> 00:25:54,802
Hell, skip it.
I've never been religious, anyway.

232
00:25:57,346 --> 00:26:00,057
Bon appetit.

233
00:26:05,396 --> 00:26:08,399
What do you like to do?

234
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:14,447
You know, I have to work and stuff.
It's hobbies.

235
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:17,950
That's a mundane question, but I guess
people ask that just to get...

236
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:21,162
to know each other, right? I read.

237
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:25,749
Right now I'm reading Hemmingway,
"The Sun Also Rises".

238
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,126
And...

239
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:31,964
You really should eat.
It's going to get cold.

240
00:26:32,131 --> 00:26:34,341
Anyway, so, in the book,

241
00:26:34,425 --> 00:26:37,094
this guy, he loves this girl so much...

242
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:41,182
that he's willing to forgive
everything that she does.

243
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:45,186
Even her infidelities.

244
00:26:46,145 --> 00:26:49,273
That's a pretty intense story, but...

245
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:53,819
that's what love is supposed to be, right?

246
00:26:57,615 --> 00:27:02,115
My boyfriend's going to get worried and
he's going to come looking for me, Tom.

247
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:16,421
If I don't show up he's going to come
looking for me. He knows where I work.

248
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:24,308
How long have you guys
been dating or hanging out?

249
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:27,937
Two years.
- Two years?

250
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:33,772
Do you guys live together?
- It's none of your fucking business.

251
00:27:34,902 --> 00:27:38,030
That's not very nice dinner talk.

252
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:42,410
Yeah, we live together. Ok?

253
00:27:46,372 --> 00:27:47,706
Two years.

254
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:52,962
That's more than a boyfriend, that's a...

255
00:27:53,045 --> 00:27:57,215
It sounds like wedding bells.
Do you guys have any plans?

256
00:27:57,633 --> 00:28:01,345
Yes.
- What does your fiancé do?

257
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:05,349
He's a journalist.
- Journalist.

258
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:08,477
See, I knew he had to be smart.
What kind of journalist? - Sports.

259
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:11,063
Sports? What paper?
- "The Post".

260
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:13,774
"The Post"? I read "The Post".
What's his name?

261
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:16,986
Mark Clayton.
- Clayton? Clayton.

262
00:28:17,653 --> 00:28:20,656
I don't remember that name.

263
00:28:21,532 --> 00:28:26,032
You know, I have one over here.
- It's online. It's "The Post online".

264
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:38,799
You know, it is amazing that you're able
to keep a relationship...

265
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:42,011
with the amount of hours that you work.

266
00:28:42,845 --> 00:28:47,015
He must get really lonely
when you have to work late, right?

267
00:28:48,517 --> 00:28:51,186
Do you love him?

268
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:53,981
Does he love you?

269
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:02,819
I'm only asking, because I'm worried
about how quickly he's going to get here.

270
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:07,495
I'm sure he's already on his way.

271
00:29:10,998 --> 00:29:12,082
Right.

272
00:29:13,167 --> 00:29:15,544
He's probably on the Harlem River Drive
as we speak.

273
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:17,796
What kind of a car does he drive?
- I don't know.

274
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,048
You don't know? You don't know
what kind of car your fiancé drives?

275
00:29:20,132 --> 00:29:24,302
Toyota, I think. I don't know.
- Toyota, what a fast car.

276
00:29:25,179 --> 00:29:28,640
He could be here a lot sooner
than I was thinking.

277
00:29:28,724 --> 00:29:32,894
He could be coming down this ramp
right now as we speak.

278
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:44,906
You know, you haven't been
very talkative since we met,

279
00:29:46,867 --> 00:29:48,493
but now...

280
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:53,582
you're telling me all
about your boyfriend.

281
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:56,669
Oh, sorry, your fiance.

282
00:29:57,128 --> 00:30:01,628
So either we've become best friends
over dinner or you're lying to me.

283
00:30:04,051 --> 00:30:06,261
I'm going to guess.

284
00:30:06,345 --> 00:30:09,056
You're lying to me.

285
00:30:12,518 --> 00:30:16,647
You don't really have a boyfriend, do you?
But you want one.

286
00:30:19,191 --> 00:30:22,819
You want somebody who cares about you,

287
00:30:24,613 --> 00:30:28,199
worries about you.
- Please, don't.

288
00:30:28,826 --> 00:30:31,829
You've got a great family.

289
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:36,959
You know, you've got Lorraine.

290
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:40,254
And Jimmy and Rose. They love you.

291
00:30:42,631 --> 00:30:46,384
They're probably
getting worried about you.

292
00:30:46,927 --> 00:30:48,929
Maybe we should give them a call.

293
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,347
Yeah?

294
00:30:50,681 --> 00:30:53,392
Tell them you're ok.

295
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:57,438
What do you think?

296
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,913
But what shall we say?

297
00:31:14,955 --> 00:31:18,625
I know, I know.
We should say you made other plans.

298
00:31:18,709 --> 00:31:21,837
No. You probably already said that one.

299
00:31:22,254 --> 00:31:26,007
You know what?
You should think of something.

300
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:29,011
You're a good liar.

301
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:31,388
Go ahead.

302
00:31:33,015 --> 00:31:34,141
Go!

303
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,185
No.

304
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:51,450
(Rose)
Hello.

305
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:52,785
Hello?

306
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:57,248
Hey, Rosie.
Can you get your mommy on the phone?

307
00:31:57,456 --> 00:32:01,460
Who's calling, please?
- It's Auntie Angie.

308
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:04,630
Mommy, it's Aunt Angie.

309
00:32:04,713 --> 00:32:08,174
(Lorraine) Give me a second. It's Angela.
Hey. Where are you?

310
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,052
- Angela?

311
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:13,180
I'm not feeling well.
- What do you mean?

312
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:16,100
We're all waiting for you.
She says she's not feeling well.

313
00:32:16,183 --> 00:32:20,103
(Man) That's what she said the last time.
(Lorraine) Can I talk to my sister?

314
00:32:20,187 --> 00:32:23,190
So, where are you, Angie?

315
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,777
(Lorraine)
Angela?

316
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:29,822
I'm home. I went home.

317
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:33,200
(Mom) What's wrong? Where is she?
(Lorraine) I really don't understand.

318
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:35,744
Last time I talked to you,
you said you were on your way.

319
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:39,998
What about the costume?
(Man) You know what? Let's just eat.

320
00:32:40,332 --> 00:32:43,376
(Lorraine) Angela, you know it would
be nice if you tried to put your family...

321
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,921
ahead of your work sometimes.
(Mom) That's enough. Give me the phone.

322
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:48,716
Angie, what's wrong?

323
00:32:49,091 --> 00:32:52,344
Hello? I can't hear her.

324
00:32:52,678 --> 00:32:56,807
Hello, Sweetie. Can you hear me?
- Hi, Mom. I'm here.

325
00:32:57,266 --> 00:33:00,310
Honey, what happened? Where are you?

326
00:33:00,394 --> 00:33:03,105
I don't know.

327
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:06,442
I think it's the flu.
- You really sound terrible.

328
00:33:06,525 --> 00:33:09,528
Are you sure you're ok? Honey?

329
00:33:10,404 --> 00:33:11,530
Yeah.

330
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:15,493
I just need some rest.

331
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:20,118
Ok, well, rest up and hopefully
you'll feel better for lunch tomorrow.

332
00:33:21,123 --> 00:33:24,668
And Sweetie,
don't worry about the costume. OK?

333
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:27,838
Merry Christmas, Angel. I love you.

334
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:30,925
I love you, too, Mom.

335
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:39,725
Hey.

336
00:33:41,018 --> 00:33:45,188
That's the best Christmas present
anyone's ever given me.

337
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,649
Thank you.

338
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:52,321
Now, I have a present for you.

339
00:34:13,759 --> 00:34:14,968
Go ahead.

340
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:17,805
Open it.

341
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,227
Aren't you even curious?

342
00:34:24,311 --> 00:34:27,022
Come on. Open it.

343
00:34:29,483 --> 00:34:32,194
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

344
00:34:41,787 --> 00:34:45,248
I bet you're curious now, yeah?
(Thomas is laughing)

345
00:34:45,332 --> 00:34:48,043
Ok, enough torture.

346
00:34:52,464 --> 00:34:55,467
Watch. It's all cued up.

347
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:03,434
Why are you showing this to me?
- Wait.

348
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:33,756
You fucked up now, asshole.

349
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,803
Sorry you had to see that.

350
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,728
(Thomas)
You want to go for a stroll?

351
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:56,691
These guys always do whatever they want.

352
00:36:03,535 --> 00:36:04,911
Here we go.

353
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:12,252
(Angela is screaming)
Rocky, sit! Stay down.

354
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:18,550
Stay still. Stay still. Give me your arm.

355
00:36:19,426 --> 00:36:20,677
Give it.

356
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:24,682
Why? Why? Why did you do that?

357
00:36:30,437 --> 00:36:33,440
Rocky, shut the fuck up!

358
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:40,322
Let me help you up. Don't be silly.
I'm not going to hurt you, alright?

359
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:44,906
You're hurting my arm.
- That's because you won't relax your arm.

360
00:36:48,163 --> 00:36:50,790
Come on now.
- Just let me go. I won't tell anyone.

361
00:36:50,874 --> 00:36:54,002
Oh, yeah. I believe you.
I will show you something.

362
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,273
Alright.
Let's put that all behind us, yeah?

363
00:37:15,649 --> 00:37:17,692
Here we go.

364
00:37:31,331 --> 00:37:35,418
I think I drank too much wine.

365
00:37:37,045 --> 00:37:40,048
I shouldn't be driving.

366
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,511
I'm just kidding.

367
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,601
You know, I've seen you drive
out of here so many times.

368
00:37:51,685 --> 00:37:55,730
It's strange actually
being in the car with you.

369
00:37:56,148 --> 00:38:00,318
It's great, actually.
(Angela) You said we were taking a drive.

370
00:38:00,402 --> 00:38:01,486
We are.

371
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:06,366
Then why are we going down, Tom?
- It's freezing out there.

372
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:11,455
Besides, this is going to be much better.

373
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:24,885
Why are we down here, Thomas?

374
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:27,262
Tom.

375
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,825
Oh, my God.

376
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:52,495
Oh, my God, Tom. What is this?

377
00:38:52,579 --> 00:38:55,582
This is my present to you.

378
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:08,470
Take this and show him.

379
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:13,350
Show him what?

380
00:39:13,433 --> 00:39:15,768
Show him you're not a slut.

381
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:20,353
Take this and teach him he can't
be touching every woman that he wants.

382
00:39:22,609 --> 00:39:25,320
Are you talking about
what happened in the elevator?

383
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:29,491
Oh, Tom. No. No, no, no.
You don't understand. That was a mistake.

384
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:33,287
That was a stupid mistake.
- What? What? He tried to rape you.

385
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:37,870
No. No, he got a little out of hand at
a party, Tom. He hardly tried to rape me.

386
00:39:38,083 --> 00:39:40,543
Look, he was drunk.

387
00:39:40,627 --> 00:39:42,962
He apologized.

388
00:39:43,046 --> 00:39:47,546
Oh, he apologized. Oh, you think you're
the first woman he tried to do this to?

389
00:39:48,051 --> 00:39:52,180
I've seen him trying to touch every woman
in the building. He's a pervert.

390
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:55,392
He's a degenerate.
- No. No. He's not.

391
00:39:55,642 --> 00:39:57,852
He's a good man, Tom.

392
00:39:57,936 --> 00:40:01,981
He's a good man. Just look at him.
He has a family. He has a wife. Tom.

393
00:40:02,065 --> 00:40:06,027
Please, Tom, just...
- Tom. Stop calling out my name, alright?

394
00:40:06,111 --> 00:40:09,155
I know what you're trying to do.
You're trying to humanize yourself...

395
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:11,324
like you're some poor victim. I told you.

396
00:40:11,408 --> 00:40:14,077
I'm not going to hurt you. Alright?

397
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:17,706
Stop calling out my name, alright?
Enough is enough. Tom. Tom. Tom.

398
00:40:17,789 --> 00:40:19,874
Every time just the same.

399
00:40:20,417 --> 00:40:21,835
Ok.

400
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:26,798
Oh.

401
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:29,676
Oh.

402
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:34,514
I know you're a person, ok?
I know you're a person. Ok?

403
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,850
I'm a person, too.

404
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:40,979
I know you have feelings.
I have feelings, too.

405
00:40:41,521 --> 00:40:44,190
I care about your feelings.

406
00:40:44,274 --> 00:40:48,774
He's the one you should be scared of.
He's the one who has no feelings.

407
00:40:50,864 --> 00:40:53,867
So, if you want to help him,

408
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:57,621
take this and teach him a lesson.

409
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:05,086
I told you.

410
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:07,046
He apologized.

411
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:10,091
What? He can just apologize and then
he can do it again?

412
00:41:10,175 --> 00:41:12,177
And he's just going to apologize again.

413
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:14,303
You've got to stop letting these assholes
have their way with you.

414
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:18,888
Tom, just please believe me.
It was just a misunderstanding, Tom.

415
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:23,726
Tom. Tom. Stop calling out my name.
I told you.

416
00:41:24,189 --> 00:41:25,315
Ok.
- Didn't I?

417
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:28,110
Yes. Yes. Yes.

418
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:32,322
I'm sorry, but you're scaring me.
- Jesus. When are you going to understand?

419
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:33,490
I'm...

420
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,245
I'm here to help you.
I'm not going to hurt you.

421
00:41:42,207 --> 00:41:44,292
(Jim is screaming)

422
00:41:51,925 --> 00:41:53,051
Ok.

423
00:41:57,222 --> 00:41:59,933
I'll do it.

424
00:42:00,642 --> 00:42:03,645
You untie me and I'll do it.

425
00:42:09,317 --> 00:42:11,986
No, no, no.

426
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:16,570
Whoa. You're a good person.
- You're a good person, too.

427
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:22,201
I should have never asked you to do this.
I'm sorry. - No. No, it's ok.

428
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:26,668
It's ok, because I want to, I just...

429
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:29,588
You just have to untie me and I'll do it.

430
00:42:29,671 --> 00:42:30,797
For you.

431
00:42:40,515 --> 00:42:44,644
It's my job. It's my job to protect you.
- No, Tom. Listen to me. It's not.

432
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:49,228
It's not. Please don't do anything.
- Don't try to run away, ok?

433
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:52,861
Can I trust you?

434
00:42:53,987 --> 00:42:56,698
Can I trust you?
-Yes.

435
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:59,493
You can trust me.

436
00:43:02,537 --> 00:43:06,082
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

437
00:43:09,586 --> 00:43:10,628
So.

438
00:43:12,297 --> 00:43:15,383
You like to touch girls, do you?

439
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:18,178
No? No? Look at her.

440
00:43:18,595 --> 00:43:21,306
I said look at here.

441
00:43:23,266 --> 00:43:25,559
Does she look happy to you?

442
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:26,811
Hm?

443
00:43:28,855 --> 00:43:29,939
Yeah.

444
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:34,694
Yeah. You messed with the wrong girl, hm?

445
00:43:35,403 --> 00:43:37,530
What makes you think you deserve her?

446
00:43:37,614 --> 00:43:40,617
Hm? What gives you the right?

447
00:43:41,743 --> 00:43:43,995
You're something else, you know that?

448
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:47,082
You pretentious, Ivy League,

449
00:43:47,415 --> 00:43:49,792
piece of shit.

450
00:43:49,876 --> 00:43:53,045
You don't own the world
and everyone in it.

451
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:56,258
I mean, what is a guy like you thinking
when he puts his hands all over a girl...

452
00:43:56,341 --> 00:44:00,511
who obviously is not interested,
who is obviously not a slut?

453
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:05,725
Because that's what you think they are,
right? Yeah?

454
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:09,312
I can't hear you. What did you say? What?
Hm?

455
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:13,896
Can you speak up, because you can't talk
your way out of this one, can you?

456
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:19,281
Why am I even wasting my time with you?
- No!

457
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:24,782
What the hell? He deserves it.
- Don't do anything, Thomas. Please.

458
00:44:41,052 --> 00:44:42,136
No!

459
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:46,933
Thomas, stop it.

460
00:44:50,937 --> 00:44:51,979
No.

461
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:08,830
Way to ruin Christmas, asshole.

462
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:28,265
Well, he won't be bothering you again.
- Where are we going?

463
00:45:29,726 --> 00:45:34,226
We can't just leave him there?
- Why? Why are you defending him?

464
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:36,732
I'm not.

465
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,402
I'm not.
- Why? Did you like this?

466
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:42,489
Do like to get touched? Hm? You like it
when he touches you in the parking garage?

467
00:45:42,572 --> 00:45:45,324
You want to get laid here?
- No. You know that's not true.

468
00:45:45,408 --> 00:45:49,161
So what? What is it?
Is it a career thing?

469
00:45:49,579 --> 00:45:53,332
Did you fuck him to get a promotion? Hm?

470
00:45:54,167 --> 00:45:57,170
You can't leave him here.

471
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:03,092
You're right. You're right. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

472
00:46:03,843 --> 00:46:06,846
We shouldn't leave him here.

473
00:46:08,223 --> 00:46:09,557
Thomas, stop!

474
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:17,774
What are you doing?
- We're going to take him for a drive.

475
00:46:17,857 --> 00:46:21,485
What are you doing? No, Thomas.
Stop the car. Stop.

476
00:46:21,569 --> 00:46:24,154
Please, stop. Please.

477
00:46:25,573 --> 00:46:29,702
Stop it. Stop it.
What are you doing, Tom? No! No!

478
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:36,710
No. No. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

479
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:43,921
Don't do this. Please. Don't. Don't. No.
Thomas, please don't do this.

480
00:46:45,885 --> 00:46:47,011
No.

481
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:48,512
No.

482
00:46:54,602 --> 00:46:55,644
Thomas. No.

483
00:46:56,938 --> 00:47:00,608
Please, don't do this. No.

484
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:04,904
No. No!

485
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:13,413
Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey.

486
00:47:14,372 --> 00:47:17,083
Where are you going?

487
00:47:18,376 --> 00:47:19,418
Angela.

488
00:47:20,086 --> 00:47:23,839
Angela. Come back.
You're fucking a great liar.

489
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,174
Liar.

490
00:47:47,697 --> 00:47:49,782
(Police siren)

491
00:47:51,951 --> 00:47:54,620
Hey! Down here!

492
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:58,541
Hey, can you hear me? Help!

493
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:06,216
Down hear. Can't you hear me?

494
00:49:29,215 --> 00:49:30,674
Oh shit.

495
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,431
Good boy.

496
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:54,073
Good boy.

497
00:49:55,992 --> 00:49:58,077
I just take my bag.

498
00:49:58,161 --> 00:50:00,413
Stay right there.

499
00:50:57,971 --> 00:50:59,639
Help me!

500
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:02,517
Help me, please. Help!

501
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:10,145
Help me, please. Help! Someone's trying
to kill me. Please help me.

502
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:14,737
Help me.

503
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:17,949
Somebody's trying to Kill.

504
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:21,703
Please somebody help.
- Where are you?

505
00:51:30,878 --> 00:51:32,921
Come on. Please.

506
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:50,648
(Dog is barking)

507
00:51:51,899 --> 00:51:52,941
Oh no.

508
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:26,684
(Thomas)
Angela.

509
00:52:27,602 --> 00:52:31,689
Please. Please. If anyone can hear me,
I'm trapped in the underground parking...

510
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:36,152
of the Arcadia building.
It's 2370 Park Avenue.

511
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:40,656
Someone's trying to kill me.
(Thomas) Angela.

512
00:52:41,866 --> 00:52:44,451
Angela, come out.

513
00:52:44,535 --> 00:52:45,577
Shit.

514
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:48,455
Angela. Angela.

515
00:52:48,539 --> 00:52:49,790
No.

516
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:55,213
Can we talk about this?

517
00:52:59,759 --> 00:53:03,512
Looks like somebody's playing game,
hm, Rocky?

518
00:53:10,895 --> 00:53:12,229
Angela?

519
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,712
Come on. Close. Come on.

520
00:54:20,631 --> 00:54:21,882
Lobby.

521
00:54:22,258 --> 00:54:25,386
Come on. Lobby. Lobby. Come on.

522
00:54:25,970 --> 00:54:28,973
Why is it fucking locked?

523
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:32,977
Angela.

524
00:54:33,811 --> 00:54:35,896
(Dog is barking)

525
00:54:40,234 --> 00:54:41,276
Hello.

526
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:47,325
Hello. Can anyone hear me?

527
00:55:14,977 --> 00:55:18,897
Please, hello? Please answer.
Please. Please.

528
00:55:20,441 --> 00:55:23,569
(Man)
Yes, 5 Buroughs Security. Hello.

529
00:55:26,447 --> 00:55:29,533
Hello?
- Yes,. I'm here. Can you hear me?

530
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:32,828
I can hear you fine. How can I help you?
- I'm being kidnapped.

531
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:37,041
I work at Brighter, Smith and Steinberg.
It's 2370 Park Avenue.

532
00:55:37,124 --> 00:55:41,211
And I'm hiding in the elevator.
Please can you call 911? - Calm down.

533
00:55:41,295 --> 00:55:44,881
Is there someone with you right now?
- No, he's outside.

534
00:55:44,966 --> 00:55:47,718
He's in the parking lot.
He already killed someone else.

535
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:50,721
Did you see him do it?
- Yes, his name is Thomas.

536
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:54,600
He's the parking attendant in my building.
If you'll please hurry. I'm in danger.

537
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:59,184
Ma'am, you have got to relax.
- How do you fucking expect me to relax?

538
00:55:59,647 --> 00:56:03,442
This man is trying to kill me. Can you
just please try to understand...

539
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:07,238
and call the cops? Please, just call 911.

540
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:12,576
The police? No.

541
00:56:13,494 --> 00:56:16,622
I'm sure he's just trying to help you.

542
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:19,083
Right?

543
00:56:20,334 --> 00:56:21,460
Angela.

544
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:26,841
Angela, are you still there?

545
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:30,845
Listen, you fuck face, I called the cops
and I'm going to stay down here...

546
00:56:30,928 --> 00:56:35,057
as long as it takes until they get here
so I suggest you get the fuck out.

547
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:37,726
(Thomas)
I just want to talk to you, Angela.

548
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:42,310
That's why I pretended to be someone else.
Ok? So don't be upset.

549
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:45,609
Will you come out? I was just kidding.

550
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:48,946
Just go to hell.
- Angela, don't you understand?

551
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:53,075
I did it for you.
That guy showed you no respect.

552
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:58,873
Why won't you talk to me, Angela?

553
00:56:59,665 --> 00:57:02,668
Just give me a chance.

554
00:57:04,045 --> 00:57:08,215
You know, if you just give us a chance,
it can work out.

555
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:10,384
You'll grow to like me.

556
00:57:10,468 --> 00:57:14,180
You know, that's usually what happens
when 2 people are forced to be together...

557
00:57:14,263 --> 00:57:18,433
in a stressful situation.
They have to depend on one another,

558
00:57:18,684 --> 00:57:22,771
and eventually they support each other,
and like each other.

559
00:57:22,855 --> 00:57:25,983
Sometimes they even fall in love.

560
00:57:28,527 --> 00:57:29,736
Angela.

561
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:34,492
Angela, please, please don't do this.

562
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:38,954
Hm? Why won't you talk to me?

563
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:47,296
You know, I wish you had just
a little bit more respect for yourself.

564
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:58,766
(Music)

565
00:58:26,585 --> 00:58:28,670
(Door is being opened)

566
00:59:29,106 --> 00:59:32,234
I want to go out. Do you hear me?

567
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:36,071
What are you doing? You fuck!

568
00:59:54,131 --> 00:59:55,257
No.

569
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:24,870
(Angela is screaming)

570
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:32,545
Oh, what did he do? Karl.

571
01:00:58,112 --> 01:00:59,780
Karl. Karl.

572
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:03,450
Karl.

573
01:01:04,368 --> 01:01:05,994
Oh my God.

574
01:01:08,914 --> 01:01:09,998
Karl.

575
01:01:35,149 --> 01:01:37,151
(Thomas)
Angela.

576
01:01:40,654 --> 01:01:43,657
You must be freezing out here.

577
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:45,742
Angela!

578
01:01:57,546 --> 01:01:59,631
What a mess.

579
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:06,346
Angela.

580
01:02:08,682 --> 01:02:11,685
I think Karl is hurt.

581
01:02:12,436 --> 01:02:13,520
Angela.

582
01:02:14,772 --> 01:02:17,441
Should we call him an ambulance?

583
01:02:17,524 --> 01:02:18,608
Hm?

584
01:02:19,193 --> 01:02:22,070
Yeah, that way he can go back
to his kids and his family.

585
01:02:22,154 --> 01:02:25,740
And you can go to your sister's
and I can stay here,

586
01:02:26,283 --> 01:02:30,036
in this parking lot, all by myself,

587
01:02:30,496 --> 01:02:34,249
because that's obviously
what everybody wants!

588
01:02:38,045 --> 01:02:39,087
Angela.

589
01:02:45,469 --> 01:02:49,639
I just can't keep chasing
you around all night, Angela.

590
01:02:50,557 --> 01:02:51,766
Besides,

591
01:02:52,977 --> 01:02:55,980
the whole place is locked.

592
01:02:58,649 --> 01:02:59,858
Angela.

593
01:03:00,693 --> 01:03:01,735
Angela.

594
01:03:02,319 --> 01:03:05,739
Where are you going to go if you get away?

595
01:03:05,823 --> 01:03:08,826
It's freezing out there.

596
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:10,327
Angela.

597
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:13,664
Angela?

598
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:17,126
Angela?

599
01:03:22,423 --> 01:03:23,715
Angela.

600
01:03:25,175 --> 01:03:26,301
Angela.

601
01:03:34,226 --> 01:03:36,937
Way to ruin Christmas, Karl.

602
01:04:08,093 --> 01:04:12,593
(Song)
I'll have a blue Christmas

603
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:17,102
without you.

604
01:04:18,937 --> 01:04:22,732
I'll be so blue

605
01:04:22,816 --> 01:04:27,316
just thinking about you.

606
01:04:30,115 --> 01:04:34,536
Decorations of red

607
01:04:35,329 --> 01:04:39,333
on a green christmas tree.

608
01:04:41,835 --> 01:04:45,129
Won't be the same dear,

609
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:49,301
if you're not here with me.

610
01:04:49,718 --> 01:04:53,346
And when those blue

611
01:04:54,348 --> 01:04:58,018
snowflakes start falling,

612
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:03,690
That's when those blue

613
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:08,362
memories start calling.

614
01:05:11,031 --> 01:05:15,243
You'll be doin' alright,

615
01:05:16,203 --> 01:05:20,248
with your Christmas of white.

616
01:05:21,708 --> 01:05:24,919
But I'll have a blue,

617
01:05:26,004 --> 01:05:28,089
blue blue blue Christmas.

618
01:05:50,988 --> 01:05:55,488
You'll be doin' alright,

619
01:05:56,201 --> 01:06:00,288
with your Christmas of white,

620
01:06:01,623 --> 01:06:04,917
But I'll have a blue,

621
01:06:05,711 --> 01:06:08,255
blue blue blue Christmas.

622
01:06:11,717 --> 01:06:14,010
Thank you. Thank you very much.

623
01:06:20,517 --> 01:06:23,228
(Thomas)
I love you.

624
01:06:23,896 --> 01:06:26,607
I'm so fond you.

625
01:06:36,825 --> 01:06:39,828
...to find a way out.

626
01:06:40,996 --> 01:06:43,707
He will pay for it.

627
01:06:52,299 --> 01:06:54,592
So, what do you think?

628
01:06:54,676 --> 01:06:57,387
That's so easy.

629
01:06:59,139 --> 01:07:01,850
That's very good.

630
01:07:02,226 --> 01:07:04,353
Oh, I think...

631
01:07:09,441 --> 01:07:11,818
So, you want make-up?

632
01:07:11,902 --> 01:07:14,195
Hm? Ok.

633
01:07:18,659 --> 01:07:23,159
You have the most beautiful lips
I have ever seen in my life.

634
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,711
You're beautiful.

635
01:07:30,337 --> 01:07:33,465
Thank you for accepting my invitation.

636
01:07:37,928 --> 01:07:40,931
You have a wonderful body.

637
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:47,563
It was meant to be, baby.

638
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:52,191
Me and you.

639
01:07:53,277 --> 01:07:56,280
Angela, your skin is...

640
01:07:57,531 --> 01:08:00,242
It's so soft.

641
01:08:02,661 --> 01:08:03,703
Honey.

642
01:08:05,539 --> 01:08:07,749
I love you. I love you.

643
01:08:07,833 --> 01:08:10,836
Angela, you know that, right?

644
01:08:29,646 --> 01:08:30,688
Hello.

645
01:08:31,231 --> 01:08:33,399
Shit, shit. I'm here. Hello.

646
01:08:33,483 --> 01:08:36,194
Can you hear me?

647
01:08:41,033 --> 01:08:42,451
It's ok.

648
01:08:55,464 --> 01:08:57,549
(Bell ringing)

649
01:09:09,144 --> 01:09:11,896
Hello, officer. Can I help you?

650
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:15,108
Can you open up the gate, please?

651
01:09:16,693 --> 01:09:19,696
Yes, sir. I'll be right up.

652
01:09:23,575 --> 01:09:26,703
Sorry. I'm sorry. I have to do this.

653
01:09:53,772 --> 01:09:54,856
Hey.

654
01:09:56,483 --> 01:10:00,653
Sorry about that.
I was on the bottom floor doing my rounds.

655
01:10:05,367 --> 01:10:08,620
What's going on tonight?
- We got a call of a disturbance...

656
01:10:08,704 --> 01:10:11,331
at this address.
Do you know anything about that?

657
01:10:11,415 --> 01:10:15,915
No. It's been real quiet all night.
- See anything, hear anything suspicious?

658
01:10:18,004 --> 01:10:22,504
No. Like I said, I was just doing
my rounds and it's been real quiet.

659
01:10:22,634 --> 01:10:25,928
I haven't seen anybody down here.
- Any cars in there?

660
01:10:26,012 --> 01:10:29,015
Well, it is a parking garage.

661
01:10:30,684 --> 01:10:33,812
Well, there's a few cars scattered
over here on this level,

662
01:10:33,895 --> 01:10:37,398
but on the second level,
there's a rental thing and then a...

663
01:10:37,482 --> 01:10:41,235
I mean, like I said, there's been no one
around tonight, except me and Rocky.

664
01:10:41,319 --> 01:10:45,406
Two of you working here tonight?
- Yeah, kind of. He's my dog.

665
01:10:45,490 --> 01:10:48,784
He's down in the office right now.
- We're going to take a look around, man.

666
01:10:48,869 --> 01:10:53,369
Get in the back. We'll give you a ride.
- Yeah, that's a great idea.

667
01:10:54,458 --> 01:10:56,877
Yeah. I've just got to close this gate.

668
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:01,130
You know, there's a lot
of homeless people around here.

669
01:11:41,421 --> 01:11:43,423
Ok, thanks for the ride.

670
01:11:43,507 --> 01:11:46,968
Oh, if you guys want to check out
the other floors,

671
01:11:47,052 --> 01:11:49,721
just keep going around this way,
but be careful on P3.

672
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:52,766
There's broken water main. Ok?
- We'll come back around.

673
01:11:52,849 --> 01:11:53,891
Ok.

674
01:13:02,168 --> 01:13:04,420
What the hell's going on here, man?

675
01:13:49,633 --> 01:13:52,844
Help me! Help! Help!

676
01:13:59,225 --> 01:14:01,310
(Song "Santa Baby")

677
01:14:19,829 --> 01:14:21,831
Help me! Help!

678
01:14:36,096 --> 01:14:37,138
Help me!

679
01:14:39,057 --> 01:14:41,809
You sure
you haven't seen anything weird tonight?

680
01:14:41,893 --> 01:14:45,646
No. Everybody left really early tonight.

681
01:14:45,855 --> 01:14:50,109
Are you having a party in there?
- It's just me and Rocky. Not a party.

682
01:14:54,948 --> 01:14:58,284
Got anybody coming over to visit?
You know, a little action?

683
01:14:58,368 --> 01:15:02,288
Me? No, no, no. The company would fire me,
if I had anyone down here in the night.

684
01:15:02,372 --> 01:15:04,540
Especially at this hour.

685
01:15:04,624 --> 01:15:08,586
Yeah, well, we don't want
to break any rules, right, partner?

686
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:12,590
Not on my watch.
- Come on. Come on. Let's go.

687
01:15:16,219 --> 01:15:17,428
(Angela)
Help me!

688
01:15:19,639 --> 01:15:20,681
Help me.

689
01:15:21,224 --> 01:15:25,019
Alright. Well, I've got to open the gate,
so I'll just take the stairs.

690
01:15:25,103 --> 01:15:26,270
Let's do it.

691
01:15:46,082 --> 01:15:47,124
Open.

692
01:16:04,517 --> 01:16:06,810
Wait! Wait!

693
01:16:16,488 --> 01:16:19,866
You guys stay warm.
- You keep your eyes and ears open. Hm?

694
01:16:19,949 --> 01:16:20,991
Oh yeah. You bet.

695
01:16:26,498 --> 01:16:28,625
Merry Christmas.
- Yeah, you too, buddy.

696
01:16:36,633 --> 01:16:38,885
(Angela)
Wait. Wait!

697
01:17:12,794 --> 01:17:14,879
(Rocky is barking)

698
01:19:46,114 --> 01:19:48,116
(Operator) 911.
- Yes. Yes, please. I need your help.

699
01:19:48,199 --> 01:19:52,494
All of our lines are busy at the moment.
Someone will be with you shortly.

700
01:19:52,578 --> 01:19:55,289
Hello?
- Thank you.

701
01:20:25,778 --> 01:20:28,864
911. All our lines are busy at the moment.
Please hold...

702
01:20:33,369 --> 01:20:36,121
911. All our lines are busy at the moment.

703
01:20:45,256 --> 01:20:46,590
Rock? Rocky!

704
01:20:59,437 --> 01:21:00,563
Why?

705
01:21:01,522 --> 01:21:04,525
Why would you do that?

706
01:21:04,650 --> 01:21:08,111
Hm? He's just an animal.

707
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:11,907
Angela?

708
01:21:12,867 --> 01:21:16,620
Why would you kill a defenseless animal?

709
01:21:27,340 --> 01:21:30,134
After all I did for you,

710
01:21:30,218 --> 01:21:32,845
to help you,

711
01:21:32,929 --> 01:21:35,640
this is what I get?

712
01:21:36,224 --> 01:21:38,309
You kill my dog?

713
01:21:39,727 --> 01:21:42,521
Answer. Answer. Please answer.
(Thomas) Angela!

714
01:21:43,022 --> 01:21:47,109
Please.
- You're really starting to piss me off!

715
01:21:47,610 --> 01:21:48,861
Angela.

716
01:22:38,369 --> 01:22:42,869
(Operator) Hello. Hello. Are you there?
Hello. This is the police.

717
01:22:43,082 --> 01:22:46,001
Is somebody there?

718
01:22:46,085 --> 01:22:49,922
Is this an emergency? If you can hear me,
please say something.

719
01:22:50,006 --> 01:22:52,675
Tap the phone.
Let me know if you're there.

720
01:22:52,758 --> 01:22:56,928
Hello. Hello. This is the police.
This is 911.

721
01:22:57,096 --> 01:23:00,265
Are you ok? Are you there? Hello?

722
01:23:05,021 --> 01:23:08,774
You're trying to get me fired, aren't you?

723
01:23:10,401 --> 01:23:13,404
I bet you'd really liked that.

724
01:23:25,541 --> 01:23:27,417
But...

725
01:23:27,752 --> 01:23:31,005
But honey,

726
01:23:31,088 --> 01:23:33,965
what are we going to do then?

727
01:23:34,050 --> 01:23:37,803
We couldn't just live off of your salary.

728
01:23:55,947 --> 01:23:58,032
(Taser is buzzing)

729
01:25:14,692 --> 01:25:15,818
Angela.

730
01:25:19,196 --> 01:25:20,488
Angela.

01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:55,649
Shit. Shit.

734
01:26:49,161 --> 01:26:50,203
Shit.

735
01:28:00,691 --> 01:28:04,236
Let's fucking do this. You want to fuck
with me, let's fucking do this.

736
01:28:07,490 --> 01:28:08,532
Come on!

737
01:28:19,001 --> 01:28:20,460
Come on, you chicken shit. Come on!

738
01:28:53,369 --> 01:28:55,454
(Horn is honking)

739
01:29:35,411 --> 01:29:36,662
Angela.

740
01:29:39,331 --> 01:29:41,416
<i>Let me help you out. OK?</i>

741
01:29:55,806 --> 01:30:00,227
You're going to help me? Why don't you
let me help you for a change?

742
01:30:00,311 --> 01:30:01,562
Mother fucker.

743
01:30:33,177 --> 01:30:37,677
What the fuck are you doing?
- Angela. Come back. You hear? Let me go.

744
01:30:40,726 --> 01:30:44,479
Come over here and give me that right now.

745
01:30:45,564 --> 01:30:48,692
Why are you doing this, Angela? Why?

746
01:30:49,610 --> 01:30:50,902
Angela.

747
01:30:53,197 --> 01:30:57,117
Angela, I just wanted to be friends.

748
01:30:59,244 --> 01:31:01,120
I'm alone.

749
01:31:01,747 --> 01:31:03,957
I'm always alone.

750
01:31:07,544 --> 01:31:11,297
Why can't we just
spend more time together?

751
01:31:12,174 --> 01:31:13,216
Angela.

752
01:31:13,384 --> 01:31:16,095
Wait. Wait. Why?

753
01:31:16,387 --> 01:31:17,554
Why?

754
01:31:18,764 --> 01:31:21,475
Why can't we be friends?

755
01:31:21,558 --> 01:31:25,603
Hm? Why can't we just spend
Christmas together?

756
01:31:26,021 --> 01:31:29,024
Do you hear me? You stupid fucking cunt!

757
01:31:42,413 --> 01:31:46,913
Angela, wait. Wait, wait, I didn't...
- Merry Christmas, Thomas.

758
01:31:50,045 --> 01:31:53,631
No. No. No. No. No.

You alright, lady?
