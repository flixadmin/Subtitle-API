1
00:00:02,461 --> 00:00:04,141
<i>How will we be remembered?</i>

2
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:06,872
<i>Will it be for saving the world, twice?</i>

3
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:10,125
<i>No. We're the team who broke time.</i>

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,003
<i>That's right.
History has been torn to shreds.</i>

5
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:15,964
<i>Which means it's up to us
to put it back together again.</i>

6
00:00:16,058 --> 00:00:19,472
<i>Piece by piece,
fixing the so-called anachronisms</i>

7
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:21,427
<i>before we get torn to shreds.</i>

8
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:24,602
<i>So please, don't call us heroes,</i>

9
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,148
<i>we're Legends.</i>

10
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:27,735
<i>Zari Tomaz?</i>

11
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:29,459
<i>Previously
on</i> Legends Of Tomorrow...

12
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:30,854
Come with us if you want to live.

13
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:32,564
<i>That's enough, Zari!</i>

14
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:34,320
You're not going anywhere without us.

15
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:39,787
My brother had powers
because he wielded this.

16
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:43,116
He fought against A.R.G.U.S.'
injustices, so he was hunted.

17
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,210
We all were.

18
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:46,022
- Come with us.
<i>- What would you rather do?</i>

19
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,914
Hide from A.R.G.U.S. your whole life
or time travel?

20
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:50,543
- Whoa, Lily!
- I'm pregnant.

21
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:52,091
Congratulations.

22
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:53,177
Hello?

23
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:55,345
What's your name?

24
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:57,839
Mine's Ray Palmer.

25
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:04,141
5219! I repeat, we have a 5219!

26
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:06,473
Subject on the move,
lock down all exits!

27
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:09,355
<i>Code Red! Engaging lockdown protocol!</i>

28
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,570
He went this way.

29
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,119
Got him.

30
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,791
He's headed for the lab!

31
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,772
<i>Can't let you go in there, Raymond.</i>

32
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:38,162
<i>You're not gonna hurt me.</i>

33
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,089
I'm just a kid.

34
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,723
And if you want to make it to adulthood,

35
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,930
you'll start seeing
the reality of the situation.

36
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,895
So, why don't you calm down,

37
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:52,393
and we'll have ourselves a nice chat?

38
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:58,525
There you go.

39
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:01,737
Now come with us.

40
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,871
What makes a hero?

41
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:10,954
Is it powers? Strength? Bravery?

42
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:12,673
No.

43
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:15,250
A hero is forged
by his or her relationships.

44
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:18,257
Our bonds of brotherhood or sisterhood.

45
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:19,971
That is why I'm taking you all

46
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:22,094
through the 10-step
team-building process

47
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:23,846
I perfected at Palmer Tech.

48
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:26,427
Step one. Part one, icebreakers.

49
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:29,013
Dude, we've stuck on a ship
that has one bathroom.

50
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,667
I think we know each other well enough.

51
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,100
And your timing couldn't be worse,

52
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:34,652
given that we are being chased
by a water-wielding assassin

53
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:36,070
and the Time Bureau.

54
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,317
We need to grow as a team.

55
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,319
First up is "Two Truths and a Lie."

56
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:40,910
It's gonna be fun.

57
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:41,994
Lie.

58
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:43,703
I haven't started yet.

59
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:46,532
Look, I know you guys
probably think this is lame...

60
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:47,625
Truth.

61
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:50,998
But we have a new crew member, and it
is important for Zari to bond with us

62
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:53,796
not only as team members,
but as individuals.

63
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:58,252
Yeah, well, I'm no hero,
and I'm not a member of any team.

64
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,803
Besides, I already
have you all figured out

65
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:04,344
The old guy wants to be anywhere
but on this ship.

66
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:08,094
These two have some
will-they-won't-they thing going on.

67
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,938
Rory's been drunk since breakfast,
Jax is wondering if I'm single,

68
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,265
<i>and your ship's still mad at me</i>

69
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,225
for doing a teeny hack
on her subsystems.

70
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,527
Now, what's this about one bathroom?

71
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,824
<i>I've informed her repeatedly my
subsystems do not require an upgrade.</i>

72
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,245
- Guys...
- You're right, Haircut.

73
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:27,454
This is gonna be fun.

74
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,955
Let's just skip to step two.
Trust Falls.

75
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:34,587
Now, to demonstrate,
Mick, who hated me when we first met,

76
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:36,915
will fall trustingly into my arms.

77
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,792
All right. You promised me good coin
for doing this.

78
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,848
And you said you weren't
gonna say that out loud.

79
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:46,132
Well, just lean back and let go.
'Cause I'm not going anywhere, buddy.

80
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,062
What the hell?

81
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:52,104
Gideon! What happened to Ray?

82
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,558
<i>According to public record,
Mr. Palmer died in 1988.</i>

83
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,356
Wait. Ray's dead?

84
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:00,237
He better be.

85
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:08,579
How could Ray be dead?
He was just right here.

86
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:11,491
And, well, he owes me money.

87
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,669
Gideon, you said Ray died in 1988?

88
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,919
<i>Mr. Palmer went missing
on October 31, 1988.</i>

89
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,462
<i>They recovered the body two days later.</i>

90
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:22,214
He was found in the woods, dead.

91
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,468
Only eight years old.

92
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:24,841
If Ray disappeared on Halloween,

93
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,639
then we'll just go back
before whatever happens happens.

94
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:32,186
Gideon, get us to October 30, 1988.

95
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,226
Wait, are we time traveling?

96
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,440
You better buckle up.

97
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:47,360
<i>Arriving in 1988.</i>

98
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:53,116
I should've said, there're
some really strange side effects.

99
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:57,958
Buddy! Hey! You're alive!

100
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:01,291
Aw, man. I Love you, man.

101
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:02,593
Me, too.

102
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,760
And always ready for a bro-hug.

103
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:07,339
<i>I'm in the paper.</i>

104
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,514
And I'm dead?

105
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:10,726
Not yet.

106
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:13,144
We're in 1988,
the day before you disappeared.

107
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,230
Okay.

108
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,976
Well, I guess the fact
that I'm still here

109
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:17,932
means temporal permanence hasn't set in.

110
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,643
Which means we can still save my life

111
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,645
and enjoy 1988 while we're at it.

112
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:25,656
Trust Ray to find
the bright side to dying.

113
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,323
Uh, are you sure this is right?

114
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:31,824
That sweater's totally awesome.

115
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,123
How do I look?

116
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,201
Honestly, like you're being
strangled by a Muppet.

117
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:38,244
I can't believe
people used to wear this stuff.

118
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:41,501
Hey, speak for yourself.
I look good in any era.

119
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,709
I can't wait to show
you guys my home.

120
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:47,591
First, we have to go to Pizza Master,
best slice in town.

121
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,388
Then we have to go to Video Village.

122
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,410
I can't tell you how much
of my allowance I spent there.

123
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:55,269
So you're always this positive,
even when you're dead.

124
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:58,014
How can you pretend
like everything's okay?

125
00:05:58,108 --> 00:05:59,644
I'm not pretending, I believe it.

126
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,588
I've found that if I can trust in myself
I can believe everything's okay.

127
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,023
And it usually is.

128
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:05,984
It's called positive thinking.

129
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:07,283
Give it a shot.

130
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:08,858
Is he for real?

131
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,948
School's almost out. You ready, kids?

132
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:13,247
Yeah, let's motor.

133
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:18,368
Mmm. This is amazing.

134
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:22,546
Blue skies, smiling kids,
an actual white picket fence.

135
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,776
I think it's actually a trellis, but...

136
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:26,216
Yeah, same thing.

137
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:28,762
Oh.

138
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,380
Wow. There I am.

139
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,339
Thanks for the pop quiz, Mrs. Garvin.

140
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:34,642
It really reinforced some fundamentals.

141
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:37,061
Yeah, that's definitely you.

142
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:41,270
Oh. Okay, now whoever's targeting me
could be anywhere,

143
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:42,959
so keep a look out for anything unusual.

144
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,815
Hey, guys, here I come.

145
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,026
I mean, little me's coming at you.

146
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:49,611
Catch up with me on Main Street?

147
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:52,531
And, um... Keep me alive.

148
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,454
Got eyes-on. Ready to make a move.

149
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,162
Though it looks like
you're taking a detour.

150
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,416
Did you frequent the Ivy Town
Newsstand as a boy?

151
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,109
<i>Yeah, I must be picking up
the new issue of</i> Scientific American.

152
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:08,342
I was more of a <i>National
Geographic</i> boy, myself.

153
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,010
Once a geek, always a geek.

154
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,555
Well, whoever's after me
could be there, so...

155
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:15,762
Yeah, we'll stick on him.

156
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,850
Okay, I got somebody
checking out magazines

157
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,182
<i>and one shopkeeper.</i>

158
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,232
I could knock this place off
with a water pistol.

159
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,356
Okay, new mission,
keep me away from Mick.

160
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,063
I don't want today to be the day
I descend into a life of crime.

161
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:38,827
Well, Haircut, looks like it's too late.

162
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,407
<i>Wait, what does that mean?</i>

163
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,118
You're by the candy bars...

164
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,374
Well, get me away from there.
That stuff's poison!

165
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,504
- Yeah, that's not all.
<i>- Wait, what does that mean?</i>

166
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,924
You're shoplifting.

167
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,046
Wait. What?

168
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,378
Damn, Haircut, you had balls.

169
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,824
I've never stolen a thing in my life.

170
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

171
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:01,308
Well, you have now.

172
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:02,976
I'm proud of you.

173
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:05,892
Little you's on the move.

174
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,484
Well, stop him! Me.

175
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,731
Stop both of us!

176
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,362
I'm no rat.

177
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,068
Ready at the home front.

178
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:19,076
See, now, this? This is a time machine.

179
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,991
I got eyes on little Ray.

180
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:24,793
We've got a hostile incoming.

181
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,417
What is it? Assassin? Time Bureau?

182
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,041
Almost as bad.

183
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:31,504
Bullies.

184
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,336
Hey, Palmer. Let's play.

185
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:36,301
No, that's just Gus and Ty.
We were friends.

186
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:37,552
Very funny, guys.

187
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,054
You want me to rough 'em up?

188
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:42,182
Nah, they were just kidding.

189
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,480
Give that back! Come on!

190
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,273
- Give that back!
- Here.

191
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,351
I'm beginning to think
maybe they weren't kidding.

192
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,689
Boring. Let's go, Ty.

193
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,613
I can't believe
he thinks we're actually friends.

194
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,069
<i>Bye, guys.</i>

195
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,367
Guess kids are mean in any time period.

196
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,706
We circled the neighborhood,
checked the yard. It seems normal.

197
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:06,795
Scary normal.

198
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,287
Maybe young Ray died of boredom.

199
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,338
No, something's up. Something's wrong.

200
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,500
Look, maybe it's the candy.

201
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:15,337
Maybe I overdose on high fructose
corn syrup and food coloring.

202
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,298
Or maybe your killer aborted
when we showed up.

203
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,920
Let's get back to the ship
and check the historical record.

204
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:22,802
Give me a minute.

205
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:29,687
Dinner time.

206
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,359
Got you gummy bears,
licorice, Nougat Nummies.

207
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,157
Wait till we go
trick-or-treating tomorrow.

208
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,284
There's a whole lot more
where that came from.

209
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,033
I'm talking to someone in my room.

210
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,049
Knew you were hungry!

211
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,804
Coast is clear, Gumball.
You can come on out.

212
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:16,238
Guys? I think I know what kills me.

213
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:19,158
It's a Dominator.

214
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,958
So... Aliens are real.

215
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,910
Yup. And those ones
are called Dominators.

216
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,004
They're nasty, too.

217
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:33,206
Capable of telepathy,
advanced technology,

218
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,299
and the fun one,

219
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:35,945
- tearing people limb-from-limb.
- Great.

220
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:38,757
The last time we faced them,
they almost wiped out meta-humans

221
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:40,304
and made us to fight each other.

222
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,006
And worse, fight together.

223
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,093
And now little-me kidnapped one
and is treating it like a house pet,

224
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,927
which would be cool if it wasn't deadly.

225
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,855
Maybe the baby Dominator hasn't
developed all of its abilities yet?

226
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:52,253
<i>The infant of the species
has the strength of the adult</i>

227
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:53,438
<i>with none of its discretion.</i>

228
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:56,362
<i>It can also
mind-control subjects at will.</i>

229
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,856
How can you not remember
befriending an alien?

230
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,191
Because I didn't.

231
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:01,867
It never happened to me.

232
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,741
The Dominator is an anachronism.

233
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,975
<i>- It's time-displaced.</i>
- Right.

234
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,286
So we have to get that baby Dominator
out of Ray's bedroom

235
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,958
and back to where it belongs.

236
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,660
And how are we supposed to do that?

237
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,461
Uh, well, it should be easy.

238
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:15,151
All we have to do is
sneak into my house tomorrow,

239
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,652
when my mom's at work and I'm at school,

240
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,508
and kidnap the Dominator.

241
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,328
I even know where the spare key is.

242
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,092
Like stealing candy from a baby.

243
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,298
But not as fun.

244
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,475
Yo. Where were you, man?
You missed the team meeting.

245
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:28,848
Oh, you finished already?

246
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,726
I was just on my way,
but I can ask Gideon to debrief me.

247
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,979
Uh, psychic connection, so I know
you're hiding something.

248
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,608
I have no idea what you're referring to.

249
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,360
Zari was right.

250
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,136
You don't actually want to be
on the <i>Waverider,</i> do you?

251
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,160
Don't be ridiculous.

252
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,827
I am as committed to this mission
as I've ever been.

253
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:55,797
What's going on?

254
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,423
Grey's keeping some sort of secret.

255
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,383
You want to know what's going on?

256
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,655
Well, do you know
what's going on with him?

257
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,170
I have my suspicions, yeah.

258
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:06,132
And, uh, I have my ways
of extracting information.

259
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,731
Home sweet home.

260
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,018
- Wait.
- What? What is it?

261
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:19,437
No shoes on the carpet.

262
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,135
I guess we can probably
let go of that now.

263
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,570
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

264
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:28,613
Oh, man, never thought
I'd be here again.

265
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,912
My brother Sydney and I
used to fight over this thing.

266
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,452
He always wanted to play <i>Tecmo Bowl</i>

267
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,502
and all I wanted to do
was play <i>Legend of Zelda.</i>

268
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:40,420
Yeah, the only video games we had
were military training simulations,

269
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,033
but, yeah, that sounds hard for you.

270
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,012
Our record player.

271
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,508
Hey, who's "Billy Joel"?

272
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,136
What? <i>Piano Man? River of Dreams?</i>

273
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,601
Really? Wow.

274
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,347
You really did live in a dystopia.

275
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,516
<i>No time to waltz down
memory lane, Ray.</i>

276
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,166
Find the Dominator and get out of there

277
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:56,690
before anyone sees you all grown up.

278
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,754
<i>Dude, I didn't know
you were a Billy Joel fan.</i>

279
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,270
What's your favorite album?
Everyone says <i>The Stranger,</i>

280
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:04,357
but for my money <i>Nylon Curtain,</i>
his Beatles tribute album,

281
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,157
is super-ambitious.

282
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:07,684
Let us know when you're heading out.

283
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,411
We're ready for retrieval.

284
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:12,456
Whoa. I never thought
I'd be back in my room.

285
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,325
Guys, we're in my room.

286
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,213
It's in the closet.

287
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,956
Okay, no sudden movements.

288
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:32,389
Ugh. Leave it to young you
to see the best in that thing.

289
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,015
Though you were pretty lonely.

290
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:35,888
What? I wasn't lonely.

291
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,857
I was just choosing
to focus on my studies.

292
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:41,204
<i>This is probably
just my scientific curiosity</i>

293
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,650
- getting the better of me. Again.
- Great.

294
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,071
<i>Popcorn's ready.</i>

295
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,240
Aren't you supposed to be in school?

296
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,193
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, this is a problem.

297
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:51,995
No. Yesterday shoplifting,
today I'm a truant.

298
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,538
This thing is turning me into Rory.

299
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:54,624
Young you is on the way.

300
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,090
Hey! No! Get off me!

301
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,086
No. I am not a toy.

302
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:11,265
Stop that. Toys are our friends.

303
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,635
I don't remember you.

304
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,099
Hmm.

305
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,227
Come on, this is my favorite.

306
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:25,354
<i>It's 1:30 already. It's morning!</i>

307
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:29,067
<i>Yes. And what a lovely morning!</i>

308
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,119
<i>Good mornin'</i>

309
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,491
<i>Good mornin'</i>

310
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,288
<i>We've talked the whole night through</i>

311
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,411
<i>Good mornin'...</i>

312
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:37,501
Is that music?

313
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:38,746
Yeah, <i>Singin' in the Rain.</i>

314
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,414
Only the best musical ever.

315
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,712
Not as good as <i>Fiddler on the Roof.</i>

316
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,711
I loved that show.

317
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:48,718
What?

318
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,306
We got a new problem.

319
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,562
You know anyone
who owns a green station wagon

320
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:00,649
with fake wood-paneling?

321
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:01,975
<i>What's my mom doing home?</i>

322
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,561
Dude, you never mentioned
your mom was hot.

323
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,272
<i>Why would I ever mention that?</i>

324
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:15,116
<i>Good mornin'
Good mornin'</i>

325
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:16,947
<i>We've gabbed the whole night through</i>

326
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,291
<i>Good mornin'
Good mornin' to you</i>

327
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:21,188
<i>Nothing could be grander
Than to be in Louisiana</i>

328
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:22,544
<i>In the mornin'...</i>

329
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,337
<i>Raymond Coswell Palmer!</i>

330
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,335
You have to hide.

331
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:28,042
<i>Where are you, Raymond?</i>

332
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,745
Why did I get a call saying that you
didn't show up to school today?

333
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,056
- Mom?
- I'm sorry, Mom. I was sick.

334
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,805
Sick.

335
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:43,182
No kidding. Of course you're sick.

336
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,892
Sick from eating all of this candy.

337
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,352
You can forget
about trick-or-treating tonight.

338
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,564
Guys, the Dominator's getting angry.

339
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,115
Somebody needs to distract my mom.

340
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,452
Fine. I'll take one for the team.

341
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,726
Raymond, this is
the second time this month

342
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,537
that I've had to leave work for you.

343
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:05,333
First you're starting a fire
in the science lab, and then what?

344
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:08,086
Now you're sitting at home,
skipping school?

345
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:09,383
School is boring.

346
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,134
I already know all the answers.

347
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,301
Too bad. You're going back.

348
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,175
So, grab your stuff. Let's go. Come on.

349
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:18,894
What was that?

350
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,719
Yeah, now would be great, guys.

351
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:29,736
What now?

352
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,160
Is there a cougar on the premises?

353
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:39,033
Excuse me?

354
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,621
Animal Control.

355
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,270
One of the neighbors said
that they heard some strange noises

356
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:44,535
coming from your home.

357
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,023
So that's what he's been up to.

358
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:48,790
Yeah, we just got done wrestling a bear

359
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:50,590
and saving, like, a bus-load of kids.

360
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:51,676
They were super cute.

361
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:53,627
We just need to come in
and take a look around.

362
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,630
Sure. Come on in. Whatever you need.

363
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,056
- Thanks.
- Whatever.

364
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:00,468
It's my son.

365
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,641
He's always sneaking out
into the woods, bringing back strays.

366
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,460
<i>Don't worry. We've seen it all.</i>

367
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:09,560
Yeah. I just wish Ray would
make normal friends, you know?

368
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:13,022
I mean, he would rather
spend his time with his animals

369
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:16,324
and movies or his weird inventions.

370
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:21,243
Sometimes I worry that he just
gets lost in his own head.

371
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:26,911
Hey, I hope kid-you
didn't hear all that.

372
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:29,417
She always said she liked my inventions.

373
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:30,964
<i>- Captain Lance?</i>
- What's up?

374
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,417
<i>I am detecting the approach
of another Timeship.</i>

375
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:35,173
What if the assassin followed us here?

376
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:38,176
We need to plead for clemency with
the Time Bureau and ask for help.

377
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:40,202
Whoever's here could be tracking us.
Stay off the comms.

378
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:41,967
I'm gonna check it out.
You keep watch here.

379
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:45,971
I'll be watching very, very closely.

380
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,313
They know about you.

381
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:55,657
We need to go.

382
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:57,699
No one cares about me anyway.

383
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,574
Oh. You need a friend.

384
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,581
Uh-oh.

385
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,504
Whoa! No!

386
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:13,758
Come on.

387
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,630
<i>Oh, no. I've got a play date.</i>

388
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,382
Zari, stay with me.

389
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,848
I don't want to spook the Dominator
or traumatize my younger self.

390
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,727
I should've stayed in 2042.

391
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:37,072
<i>Ray, hold on.</i>

392
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:38,365
How do you know my name?

393
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:41,034
It's a long, mostly-irritating story.

394
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,321
The only thing that matters is,
I'm here to save your life.

395
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:46,532
No. You want Gumball.

396
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,333
Well, you can't have him.

397
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,500
And I thought grown-up Ray was annoying.

398
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,159
Listen to me, kid. You don't want
to be alone with that thing.

399
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:04,391
You don't know him. We're friends.

400
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:08,637
Your friend is gonna kill you!

401
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,278
If I don't do it first.

402
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,610
What's going on? This about Grey?

403
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:27,288
You said the Professor's been acting
all squirrelly about where he's been.

404
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,375
Squirrelly?

405
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:30,792
Yeah, when you're on the run,
someone usually cracks.

406
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,995
Burns the crew to save themselves.

407
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:34,330
Burns the crew how?

408
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,880
Cutting a deal with the Time Bureau.

409
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:38,253
You think Grey's ratting us out
to the Time Bureau?

410
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:41,090
The old man wants off the boat.
Thinks we're in too deep.

411
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:43,506
- Yeah, but he wouldn't do that.
- Really?

412
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:46,926
Then who's been boosting the Jumpship
while we sleep?

413
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,019
Gideon.

414
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:49,873
<i>I believe Mr. Rory
is alluding to the fact</i>

415
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:52,310
<i>that someone has erased
the Jumpship's travel log.</i>

416
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:55,563
Someone's been sneaking off the ship
and snitching to the Time Bureau.

417
00:19:55,653 --> 00:20:00,068
And if there's one thing
I hate more than pigs, it's a rat.

418
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:02,408
How far could he have gone?
He's just a little kid.

419
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:05,110
Maybe if you hadn't stayed
to flirt with Ray's mother...

420
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,328
First of all,
I didn't flirt with Ray's mother,

421
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:09,077
I merely charmed her.

422
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,452
Can't help that I'm charming.

423
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:13,502
Wait. Are you jealous?

424
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:17,380
Nathaniel, I just think
we should keep it simple.

425
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:19,253
Friends.

426
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,460
Like we were
before all of this happened.

427
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:23,345
And that was still fun, right?

428
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:26,219
Right, if we just had a Timeship.

429
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,846
We could go back to where
we never even lived together.

430
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:29,936
Nate, don't.

431
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,748
And that Swedish bed
we never quite assembled.

432
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,479
I believe it was called a Doubledroff.

433
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:35,057
- Just erase their...
- Shh. Nate!

434
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,756
I'm getting something this way.

435
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,285
The mobile team
is setting up a lab now.

436
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:45,863
We need to find the Dominator
before it finds us.

437
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:48,199
- What about the kid?
- He comes with us.

438
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:49,575
We can't have this getting out.

439
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:57,913
Looks like a false alarm.

440
00:20:58,007 --> 00:20:59,589
No sign of the Time Bureau here.

441
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:12,936
Gideon says the Professor's been
spending a lot of time down here.

442
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,229
Whoa.

443
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,108
The last time I was down here
this place was just a storage room.

444
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:26,028
Looks like the Professor has been
busy behind our backs.

445
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:29,202
So what? He's a professor, man.
That's what professors do.

446
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,237
They invent stuff. Stuff like...

447
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:32,413
Like what?

448
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:35,043
Like this.

449
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:39,914
Best bet is this is some sort
of radio transmitter

450
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:42,082
that communicates through time.

451
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:43,758
With the Time Bureau.

452
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:46,136
Can't believe it.

453
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:47,633
Grey really is a traitor.

454
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,096
Kid, I know you're in there.

455
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:55,266
Oh, good. You found us.

456
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:57,605
You shall not pass!

457
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:00,479
There's no time for make-believe.

458
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,185
You are in actual danger.

459
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,854
Step down, you knave.

460
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:06,861
<i>Zari, think like a kid.</i>

461
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,872
<i>You just have to play along.</i>

462
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:11,699
I'm...

463
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,495
I'm here from a neighboring kingdom

464
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,202
to speak to Sir Galahad.

465
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:20,628
And?

466
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,289
<i>Sir Gumball.</i>

467
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:24,500
And Sir Gumball.

468
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,551
<i>Yeah, good. That's good. Keep going.</i>

469
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:30,631
It's an honor, my lieges.

470
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,226
<i>Got him! I repeat,
subject has been located.</i>

471
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:36,553
You lied to me!

472
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:38,266
No, I didn't.

473
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,210
- Hey! Let him go!
- You're coming with us.

474
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:42,396
Leave me alone! Leave us alone!

475
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,357
No!

476
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:57,081
Careful. The Dominator's sedation
is wearing off.

477
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,938
Don't worry. This little fellow's
not going anywhere.

478
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:01,203
It doesn't need to go anywhere.

479
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:03,213
<i>Using its telepathic powers,</i>

480
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,666
even a juvenile could control us
at its will.

481
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,502
Force us to set it free
or do each other in.

482
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,132
I've seen it before.

483
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:12,969
This will suppress its neural impulses,

484
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,424
neutralizing its powers...

485
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,707
As well as preventing it
from communicating with its mother,

486
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:19,731
the Queen.

487
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,601
We have the girl in a storage room.

488
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:23,183
And the boy is in questioning now.

489
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,087
Get him to tell us everything he knows.

490
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:27,234
Where he found the creature
and how long he's had it.

491
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:28,341
Then what do we do with him?

492
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:30,106
Make it so he can't tell anybody else.

493
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:32,737
- You mean...
- Mmm-hmm.

494
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:39,495
This Queen, if the baby
can control our minds,

495
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:40,996
what is she capable of doing?

496
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:42,536
Mental projection,

497
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:45,543
supplanting thoughts and sensations
into its victim's mind.

498
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:48,879
Also known to protect their young
at any cost.

499
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:03,640
You know what I'm looking for.

500
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:07,227
A breath mint?
Dermatologist recommendation?

501
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:09,608
Reese's Pieces?

502
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:12,236
All right! Your kid!
You're looking for your kid.

503
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,575
If you let me go, I'll help you.

504
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:18,531
Your species cannot be trusted.

505
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:20,991
Look, I want to help you. I do.

506
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:22,871
You can't find him without me.

507
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:24,169
Agreed.

508
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,767
Going somewhere, Professor?

509
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:43,053
I don't have time to explain. I'm taking
the Jumpship whether you like it or not.

510
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,565
Mick, come on, man.

511
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:48,143
I just souped this baby up.

512
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:50,862
Jefferson, please, I need you
to help me get out of 1988.

513
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:51,948
Help you?

514
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,690
After you've been lying to me.

515
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:56,861
You've been sneaking out on us,
you erased the jump logs.

516
00:24:56,954 --> 00:24:58,264
You're working with the Time Bureau.

517
00:24:58,288 --> 00:24:59,824
What? Never!

518
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:01,956
What's in your back pocket, Professor?

519
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:07,962
It's a trans-temporal communicator.

520
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:10,290
So you can talk
to your Time Bureau friends.

521
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:12,922
No, so I can talk to my...

522
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,220
<i>Hey, Dad!</i>

523
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:15,471
My daughter.

524
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:18,389
<i>Oh. And all you guys.</i>

525
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,683
Hey, Lily.

526
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:24,103
<i>Dad, I think it's time.
We're heading to the hospital now.</i>

527
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,600
<i>And you're gonna be here, right?</i>

528
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:28,395
How can I miss the birth
of my first grandchild?

529
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:29,601
<i>Good.</i>

530
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:31,279
<i>This baby's coming.</i>

531
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,195
<i>Okay, I will see you there. Bye, Dad.</i>

532
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,823
I took the Jumpship back to 2017

533
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:41,404
so I could give Lily
the other communicator.

534
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:43,239
And you wiped the jump-logs. Why?

535
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:46,201
Because I wanted you to know
that I was committed to you

536
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:47,295
and to the team.

537
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,120
I made the decision to stay,

538
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,955
and I needed you to know
that I meant it.

539
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:55,255
Clearly, my subterfuge has robbed me

540
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:58,213
of the chance to be
at the birth of my grandchild.

541
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:01,933
No. We can take the <i>Waverider.</i>

542
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:03,351
What about the rest of the team?

543
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:04,894
I'm sure they'll manage.

544
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:06,481
You're serious?

545
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:09,432
Grey, it's your first grandkid.

546
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:11,985
Why would you think
I'd want you to miss that?

547
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:14,404
Come on, man. Let's go.

548
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:20,530
What's going on? Where's kid Ray?

549
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:22,032
They're interrogating me. Him.

550
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:24,059
<i>Code Red! Engaging lockdown protocols!</i>

551
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,619
Let's go.

552
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:30,541
So why don't you calm down, and we'll
have ourselves a nice little chat?

553
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,048
<i>There you go.</i>

554
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:36,803
Come with us.

555
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,091
You're real.

556
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:46,896
Fire!

557
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,980
Go, go, go!

558
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,069
We gotta move.
They won't stay down long.

559
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,526
We can't leave without Gumball.

560
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:03,153
Look, that thing is not your friend.

561
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:04,454
It may be cute and cuddly now,

562
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,142
but sooner or later,
it's gonna turn on you.

563
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,452
Gumball wouldn't do that!

564
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:09,120
We can save him, I know it.

565
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:11,087
Look, Raymond,

566
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:14,707
I get that you're lonely,
and that you're just trying to cope,

567
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,293
but, buddy, you can't live
in a fantasy world forever.

568
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:20,504
- Ray...
- Look, trust me.

569
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,839
I understand that it hurts
to learn that the world

570
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:24,549
isn't as perfect as you want it to be.

571
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,093
But sooner or later,

572
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:29,729
you have to start facing reality,

573
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:32,307
otherwise, you're going to end up
getting yourself killed.

574
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,485
Hey.

575
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,941
Listen to us.

576
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:41,821
We're going to save your friend
and make it out of here together.

577
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:44,618
All right?

578
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:47,201
Because that's what brave knights do.

579
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,228
Right, Sir Galahad?

580
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,039
Let's do it.

581
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:15,062
Ugh.

582
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:18,023
Where are you, guys?

583
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,194
<i>Not sure exactly.</i>

584
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:20,508
Looks like they turned the rec center

585
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,010
into some kind
of government research facility.

586
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:23,775
We're on our way to save
the baby Dominator.

587
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:25,781
<i>- What?</i>
- It's a long story.

588
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:28,534
Well, that story's about to get
a lot more interesting

589
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:31,116
because its mom just landed,
and she's looking for him.

590
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,701
Wait. The Dominator has a Mominator?

591
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:34,001
<i>And it gets worse.</i>

592
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:36,733
I think she might have read my mind.

593
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:38,123
Wait. What did she see?

594
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:40,083
Well, she was looking for her baby.

595
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:42,089
The last time I saw him was...

596
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:43,548
At my house.

597
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:45,509
My mom's home. If the Queen finds her...

598
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:47,181
Don't worry. We won't let that happen.

599
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,621
I'll keep watch for the Queen,
you check on Ray's mom.

600
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:50,886
Okay. How do I look?

601
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,480
Kidding.

602
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,986
Animal Control. Again.

603
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:02,564
Back to check out my crawl space?

604
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:03,699
Your who?

605
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:05,284
Oh.

606
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:07,819
So, what's your excuse this time?

607
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,488
Family of possums?

608
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,706
Come to wrestle a bear?

609
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:16,536
How did you make a family of possums
sound so sexy?

610
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,747
Well, you found your animal right here,

611
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:20,965
but good luck controlling her.

612
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:26,133
Who's there?

613
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,564
Mrs. Palmer?

614
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,157
But if you're here, then...

615
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:52,155
Wow. You are very powerful.

616
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:57,285
You have no idea.

617
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:08,846
Trick or treat!

618
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:14,636
Ray's Mom, it is an honor
just to be nominated...

619
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,562
We both know it's too late to stop this.

620
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,528
Well, maybe if we just
get to know each other...

621
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:21,855
Get away from him, you bitch!

622
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,152
I knew it! You're jealous!

623
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:25,480
No. She's messing with your mind.

624
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:27,569
She's making you see things.

625
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,567
Nate, that is not Ray's mother.

626
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,461
Don't be ridiculous.
Of course it's Ray's mom.

627
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:32,538
Who else would it be?

628
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,164
Oh! I kissed a Dominator.

629
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:38,002
And I liked it.

630
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:41,955
What's the matter?
Don't you think I'm pretty?

631
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:50,880
Hey! Over here!

632
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:56,094
Super-ambitious album.

633
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,232
Sara, we found the Queen.

634
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:08,780
Whoa!

635
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:11,902
Awesome costume.

636
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:13,490
I'm almost back to the ship.

637
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,697
I'll fly to you,
try to lure her onto the brig.

638
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:18,249
Oh, crap.

639
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:20,622
"Oh, crap" what?

640
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:25,005
All right, on to Plan B.

641
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:27,675
Let's say somebody stole the <i>Waverider.</i>

642
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:29,548
What if we give the Queen
what she wants

643
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:31,254
and just hope she goes in peace?

644
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:33,339
You mean the baby? I'm already on it.

645
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:35,600
Gumball!

646
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:38,938
Don't move.

647
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:42,899
Step away. You have no idea
what that thing is capable of.

648
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,560
We're taking it with us,
no one needs to get hurt.

649
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:49,105
Can't let you do that.

650
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:51,987
I don't think you want to do that.

651
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:54,444
You should really lower your weapons.

652
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:58,666
I...

653
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:00,537
I can't...

654
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:03,286
He's controlling them.

655
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,873
- Ray, turn it back on.
- No.

656
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:08,253
No? What do you mean "no"?

657
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,504
<i>It'll hurt him.</i>

658
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:10,675
He'll hurt all of us.

659
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:12,011
He wouldn't do that.

660
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:13,457
Can't believe I was this stubborn.

661
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:16,049
Look, if you don't listen to me,
we're all gonna die.

662
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,347
<i>Good mornin'</i>

663
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:24,895
<i>Good mornin'</i>

664
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:28,444
<i>We've talked the whole night through</i>

665
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:31,064
<i>Good mornin'
Good mornin'</i>

666
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:32,690
<i>To you</i>

667
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,868
<i>Good mornin'
Good mornin'</i>

668
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,287
<i>Sunbeams will soon shine through</i>

669
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:41,491
<i>Good mornin'
Good mornin' to you</i>

670
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:45,336
<i>Good mornin'</i>

671
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:47,288
<i>It's great to stay up late</i>

672
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:49,465
<i>Good mornin'
Good mornin' to you...</i>

673
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:51,254
So we should go, right?

674
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:54,305
Yeah.

675
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:56,969
I told you he wouldn't hurt anyone.

676
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:00,847
You're right. I should have trusted you.

677
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:02,937
I'm sorry for the tough love.

678
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:06,224
<i>Good mornin'
Good mornin' to you...</i>

679
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:07,318
Let's go.

680
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:11,146
<i>...the movie show
the future wasn't bright</i>

681
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:13,401
<i>But came the dawn
The show goes on</i>

682
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,358
<i>And I don't wanna say good night...</i>

683
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:17,743
Man, you guys are really good.

684
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,036
- Ray!
- Yeah, but they were...

685
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,242
<i>- Good morning!</i>
- Yup.

686
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:21,823
<i>Good mornin'...</i>

687
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,621
Quick. I'm sure those agents
are already coming to their senses.

688
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:25,792
Hey, we can use those.

689
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:27,962
Those aren't ours. We can't steal.

690
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:29,630
Ha! I knew you were a good kid.

691
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,777
But, uh, let's just make an exception
just this once.

692
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:33,008
Guys, we've got the baby.

693
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:35,381
And we've got the Queen,
and she's trying to kill us!

694
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,138
Let's hope everyone gets here
at the same time.

695
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:40,592
Or else, we're gonna have
one angry alien momma.

696
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:41,852
We're gonna make it.

697
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:44,805
- It's okay we borrowed the <i>Waverider?</i>
- They'll be fine.

698
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:47,310
We're never gonna make it!

699
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:48,808
<i>It went this way.</i>

700
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,352
God, I hope this works.

701
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:07,876
Hey, Gumball.

702
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:23,183
Mominator incoming!

703
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,353
I'll take her. This one's personal.

704
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:27,222
She put me in a cocoon.

705
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:34,771
Just like <i>E. T.</i>

706
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,822
- What's <i>E. T.?</i>
- "What's <i>E. T.?"</i>

707
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:55,462
Go ahead.

708
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,648
You have to go now. You need your mom.

709
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:21,154
But we'll still be friends.

710
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:25,238
I'll be all right.

711
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:28,073
I have people here to take care of me.

712
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:36,381
And I wouldn't have found them
without you.

713
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:43,090
Go on, go on, little buddy.
Go to your mama.

714
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:13,703
See you later, Gumball.

715
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:32,139
I'm not crying.
I just have, uh, alien goo in my eye.

716
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:33,565
Yeah, me, too.

717
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,687
Now I'm gonna go brush my teeth forever.

718
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:38,773
Wait. Why?

719
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,572
I'm so glad

720
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:47,995
I could be here
to welcome you into this world.

721
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:50,663
I'm sure it's overwhelming,

722
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:54,414
and I'm sorry to say,
it doesn't really ever go away.

723
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:56,037
But this place

724
00:36:57,298 --> 00:37:00,917
is also full of wonders.

725
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:05,797
Wonders that I'm discovering even now.

726
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,060
Hey.

727
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:13,304
I'm sorry, man.

728
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:16,857
You almost missed this because of me,
because I didn't trust you...

729
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:18,354
No, I should have been...

730
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:21,028
I should've been honest with you
from the beginning.

731
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:24,490
You're as much a part of this family
as Lily and Clarissa

732
00:37:25,452 --> 00:37:26,784
and now, this little guy, Ronnie.

733
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:29,991
It's perfect that you're here
with us right now.

734
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,075
Mr. Rory, on the other hand,
is inexplicable.

735
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:37,997
- I thought we should celebrate.
<i>- Oh.</i>

736
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,205
One for you.

737
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,832
- One for you.
- Thank you.

738
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:44,756
- And one for you.
- Mick, dude, come on, man. Not the baby.

739
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,012
Cute.

740
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:54,141
- What happened?
- Possums.

741
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:57,732
It's mating season.
They got all in your vents.

742
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:00,104
So, um, we got rid of them.

743
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:04,363
So you're saying
one of Ray's strays didn't do this?

744
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,116
Your son?

745
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:07,576
No, no, no.

746
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:12,405
And, uh, don't worry, I'm sure he'll
grow out of that eventually, you know.

747
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:15,663
And I think you're doing
a really good job with him.

748
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:19,245
Yeah. So, can we go now, please?

749
00:38:19,339 --> 00:38:20,339
Yep.

750
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:23,587
I can't believe
you made out with my mom.

751
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:25,258
Look, man, it was the '80s.

752
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:37,562
You did the right thing, you know.
Letting him go.

753
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:40,774
He was my only real friend.

754
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,102
We were supposed
to watch the movie together.

755
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:48,820
I felt alone for a long time.

756
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:54,955
So long that I just figured
that's how things were gonna be.

757
00:38:56,543 --> 00:38:58,705
But turns out there were people
out there for me

758
00:38:58,795 --> 00:39:00,957
that I didn't even know I wanted.

759
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:06,209
You'll find your people, too. I promise.

760
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:09,219
You just have to keep believing

761
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:11,843
that things will be okay,
even when it's hard.

762
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:14,721
Will you watch the movie with me?

763
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:19,772
My ride's here, but maybe next time.

764
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,907
Besides, shouldn't you be out
trick-or-treating?

765
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:26,938
Me and Gumball were gonna go together.

766
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,694
Besides, I can't eat
all that candy anyway.

767
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:37,539
Hey, look at Palmer.

768
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:40,876
- What are you supposed to be?
- I'm the Atom.

769
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:42,999
That's like, the coolest superhero ever.

770
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:45,001
The Atom? That's a stupid name.

771
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:47,378
Actually, I think it's pretty clever.

772
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:56,018
Cool costume.

773
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,469
I can't believe you guys talked me
into wearing this.

774
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:00,020
How do you fight in these things?

775
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:01,604
Who are you guys?

776
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:03,391
We're his friends.

777
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:06,860
These guys are your friends?

778
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:09,281
Cool.

779
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,024
Hand the candy over.

780
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:14,784
And your allowance.

781
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:27,839
You know, in my time,
the FDA outlawed all of this.

782
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:29,963
Guess they got my letters.

783
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,138
Hey, do your missions
always go this poorly?

784
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:36,682
No. No.

785
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:39,309
There was this one time where we...

786
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:42,099
You know, actually, yes, they do.

787
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:45,440
Well, can't wait for the next one.

788
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,904
Which means we should probably get
to know each other.

789
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:54,233
So, Two Truths and a Lie.

790
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:55,780
Seriously?

791
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,281
Are we team-building right now?

792
00:40:57,372 --> 00:40:58,533
Number one.

793
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:01,866
Back home, my friends
used to called me "Z."

794
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:05,787
Number two. I got a copy of <i>Zelda</i>
on the black market

795
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,247
and never beat that final boss.

796
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:09,457
Ganon.

797
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,128
And number three.

798
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:14,882
I love musicals.

799
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:21,135
Z, we're watching <i>Singin' in the Rain.</i>

800
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,061
I'll go get the popcorn.

801
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,975
Hey. Movie night! Wanna join us?

802
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,773
Man, I got some work to do.

803
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:34,653
Actually, I want to ask you something.

804
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:35,993
Yeah, shoot.

805
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:40,367
It's just seeing Stein
with his grandkid earlier,

806
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:43,537
I mean, we're his family,
but this isn't his home.

807
00:41:44,085 --> 00:41:45,997
- Not anymore.
- Yeah.

808
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:48,912
But you two are inseparable.

809
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,547
Like, literally.

810
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:52,911
That's what I need your help with.

811
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:56,753
I want to break up Firestorm.
