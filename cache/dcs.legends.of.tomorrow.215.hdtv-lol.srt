1
00:00:00,742 --> 00:00:02,414
Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...

2
00:00:02,416 --> 00:00:05,468
Oh, how the mighty have fallen.

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:08,270
Leonard. I must be losing my mind.

4
00:00:08,272 --> 00:00:10,473
The reason why Snart and I got on so well

5
00:00:10,475 --> 00:00:11,941
was we trusted one another.

6
00:00:11,943 --> 00:00:13,692
We were friends.

7
00:00:13,694 --> 00:00:16,362
Have either of you gentlemen
heard of the Spear of Destiny?

8
00:00:16,364 --> 00:00:18,230
The spear could alter reality itself.

9
00:00:18,232 --> 00:00:19,565
We broke it into four separate pieces.

10
00:00:19,567 --> 00:00:21,450
Mr. Hunter took one...

11
00:00:21,452 --> 00:00:23,652
And took the rest of you to
three different time periods,

12
00:00:23,654 --> 00:00:25,070
which means the last piece unaccounted for

13
00:00:25,072 --> 00:00:26,572
must be with your grandfather.

14
00:00:26,574 --> 00:00:28,407
Waverider crew, we are now the proud owners

15
00:00:28,409 --> 00:00:30,576
of the last fragment
of the Spear of Destiny.

16
00:00:30,578 --> 00:00:32,912
Back in 1942, you have a
destiny waiting for you.

17
00:00:32,914 --> 00:00:34,630
Ask Grey what happens
to your village, ask him

18
00:00:34,632 --> 00:00:36,799
what happens to your daughter
and your granddaughter,

19
00:00:36,801 --> 00:00:40,219
and tell me you'll choose
history over your own family.

20
00:00:42,256 --> 00:00:43,255
Watch out, lads!

21
00:00:43,257 --> 00:00:44,757
- _
- Incoming!

22
00:00:49,147 --> 00:00:51,430
Coming through! Coming through!

23
00:00:51,432 --> 00:00:56,652
According to this map, Jesus'
blood is somewhere over there.

24
00:00:56,654 --> 00:00:58,487
The spear is sensing the blood.

25
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:01,240
We won't last five minutes out there.

26
00:01:01,242 --> 00:01:02,942
It's not too late to use it.

27
00:01:11,536 --> 00:01:15,421
_

28
00:01:15,423 --> 00:01:17,790
It's hard to imagine that,
when joined with their siblings,

29
00:01:17,792 --> 00:01:19,959
they're as powerful as God.

30
00:01:19,961 --> 00:01:23,095
But right now, that's just
a useless piece of wood.

31
00:01:23,097 --> 00:01:24,597
It's not useless.

32
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:26,932
I know ten different ways
to kill somebody with this.

33
00:01:26,934 --> 00:01:29,718
Not to mention,

34
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,054
it's great for scratching in
those hard-to-reach places.

35
00:01:32,056 --> 00:01:33,973
Please don't tell me you
used the Spear of Destiny

36
00:01:33,975 --> 00:01:35,307
as a back scratcher.

37
00:01:35,309 --> 00:01:37,776
Who said anything about my back?

38
00:01:37,778 --> 00:01:39,812
Well, as Mr. Rory has demonstrated,

39
00:01:39,814 --> 00:01:41,063
in the wrong hands,

40
00:01:41,065 --> 00:01:43,148
this divine artifact can be

41
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,367
- put to truly horrific use.
- Yeah.

42
00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:48,237
Which is why I called this meeting,

43
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:52,324
to figure out how to keep
it out the Legion's hands.

44
00:01:52,326 --> 00:01:54,743
Where's Nate?

45
00:01:54,745 --> 00:01:58,998
Nathaniel said he wasn't
feeling up to socializing.

46
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,833
He said he'll go along
with whatever we decide.

47
00:02:00,835 --> 00:02:02,635
What is there to decide?

48
00:02:02,637 --> 00:02:05,221
We find the Legion, and we steal
back their pieces of the spear.

49
00:02:05,223 --> 00:02:08,557
There's no need to find the Legion.

50
00:02:08,559 --> 00:02:10,476
I know where they've been operating out of.

51
00:02:10,478 --> 00:02:12,978
Why keep it a secret?
Let's just go get them.

52
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,930
The reason why you've been
unable to locate Mr. Thawne

53
00:02:14,932 --> 00:02:16,932
and his partners all this
time is because they've

54
00:02:16,934 --> 00:02:19,852
- been operating outside of it.
- You lost me.

55
00:02:19,854 --> 00:02:21,520
- Yeah, me too.
- Three.

56
00:02:21,522 --> 00:02:24,690
What's the one place that
exists outside of time?

57
00:02:24,692 --> 00:02:26,825
- No way.
- Yes way.

58
00:02:26,827 --> 00:02:32,031
We must return to the Vanishing Point.

59
00:02:43,094 --> 00:02:44,460
We're in position. Ray?

60
00:02:44,462 --> 00:02:45,761
- Ready.
- Mick?

61
00:02:45,763 --> 00:02:47,880
- Yeah.
- Standby.

62
00:02:47,882 --> 00:02:50,099
Here.

63
00:02:50,101 --> 00:02:51,800
The pieces of the spear call to each other.

64
00:02:51,802 --> 00:02:53,886
We will be able to use
these to locate the pieces

65
00:02:53,888 --> 00:02:55,521
in the Legion's possession.

66
00:02:55,523 --> 00:02:57,723
That's why we're separating into two teams.

67
00:02:57,725 --> 00:03:00,859
Mr. Jackson, shall we?

68
00:03:00,861 --> 00:03:02,645
Are you sure bringing
out pieces of the spear

69
00:03:02,647 --> 00:03:04,730
was a good idea? If this goes wrong...

70
00:03:04,732 --> 00:03:06,982
Then the Legion has the entire spear.

71
00:03:06,984 --> 00:03:08,567
So we have to be careful.

72
00:03:13,457 --> 00:03:15,240
On my way for Legion-watching.

73
00:03:15,242 --> 00:03:16,825
20 seconds.

74
00:03:19,797 --> 00:03:22,498
Well, I thought I'd seen
the last of this place.

75
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,583
Let's not make it a habit.

76
00:03:30,308 --> 00:03:32,057
Well, I appear to be getting considerable

77
00:03:32,059 --> 00:03:34,093
vibrational energy from this.

78
00:03:41,018 --> 00:03:44,520
My old friend, please, forgive me.

79
00:03:44,522 --> 00:03:46,071
Oof!

80
00:03:46,073 --> 00:03:48,991
Mick. Mick!

81
00:03:50,745 --> 00:03:52,361
Are you okay?

82
00:03:52,363 --> 00:03:55,280
Am I okay?

83
00:03:55,282 --> 00:04:00,252
Why wouldn't I be okay?

84
00:04:00,254 --> 00:04:02,621
I miss him too.

85
00:04:02,623 --> 00:04:08,427
He blew himself up. For what?

86
00:04:08,429 --> 00:04:11,180
So the rest of us could live.

87
00:04:11,182 --> 00:04:13,015
Idiot.

88
00:04:13,017 --> 00:04:15,134
Mick, we gotta go.

89
00:04:15,136 --> 00:04:17,019
Look, this is a heist.

90
00:04:17,021 --> 00:04:18,804
We have to steal the
other pieces of the spear

91
00:04:18,806 --> 00:04:21,724
and get out of here.

92
00:04:21,726 --> 00:04:23,609
You think this is what Snart wants?

93
00:04:23,611 --> 00:04:28,147
You waiting around so
that you can get caught?

94
00:04:28,149 --> 00:04:30,566
Probably not.

95
00:04:40,661 --> 00:04:42,244
Hold on a sec.

96
00:04:42,246 --> 00:04:44,380
That looks like something
you might hide something in.

97
00:04:47,885 --> 00:04:49,752
Yes, it does.

98
00:04:49,754 --> 00:04:52,304
Jax and I may have found the
other pieces of the spear.

99
00:04:52,306 --> 00:04:54,089
Standby.

100
00:04:54,091 --> 00:04:56,308
Copy that.

101
00:04:57,812 --> 00:04:59,895
And I've got eyes on Thawne.

102
00:05:03,517 --> 00:05:07,186
He doesn't know we're here.

103
00:05:12,526 --> 00:05:14,610
Your try, Mr. Jackson.

104
00:05:14,612 --> 00:05:17,496
Oh.

105
00:05:17,498 --> 00:05:19,031
What's your favorite candy?

106
00:05:19,033 --> 00:05:21,033
Jelly beans. Why?

107
00:05:35,766 --> 00:05:37,382
A little transmutation trick me and Grey

108
00:05:37,384 --> 00:05:39,101
have been working on.

109
00:05:46,193 --> 00:05:50,562
Both delicious and impressive, Mr. Jackson.

110
00:05:50,564 --> 00:05:51,730
We have the rest of the spear.

111
00:05:51,732 --> 00:05:52,981
Get back to the ship.

112
00:05:54,285 --> 00:05:55,901
We better hurry. He's on to us.

113
00:05:55,903 --> 00:05:57,369
- On my way.
- Everyone, get the hell

114
00:05:57,371 --> 00:05:59,371
- out of here.
- This can't be happening.

115
00:05:59,373 --> 00:06:01,573
They're not smart enough
for this to be happening.

116
00:06:01,575 --> 00:06:03,242
- You get it?
- Indeed.

117
00:06:03,244 --> 00:06:05,077
Gideon, get us out of here.

118
00:06:17,591 --> 00:06:20,592
No!

119
00:06:20,594 --> 00:06:22,177
Piece of cake.

120
00:06:22,179 --> 00:06:23,645
Whoa, you thought that was easy?

121
00:06:23,647 --> 00:06:25,981
No, I want a piece of cake and a beer.

122
00:06:25,983 --> 00:06:28,984
Later, where's the spear?

123
00:06:30,771 --> 00:06:35,190
There we go.

124
00:06:36,443 --> 00:06:37,743
What is that?

125
00:06:37,745 --> 00:06:39,361
That's power.

126
00:06:39,363 --> 00:06:41,246
The pieces of the spear
are calling to each other.

127
00:06:41,248 --> 00:06:43,782
They long to be whole.

128
00:06:47,705 --> 00:06:49,254
Yep, that just happened.

129
00:06:49,256 --> 00:06:50,455
Well, that's remarkable.

130
00:06:50,457 --> 00:06:52,124
The spear must be composed of some kind

131
00:06:52,126 --> 00:06:54,526
of magnetized compound which
acts as its own sealant.

132
00:06:54,528 --> 00:06:56,261
No, no, no, don't, don't, don't.

133
00:06:56,263 --> 00:06:57,713
Don't touch it.

134
00:06:57,715 --> 00:06:59,882
Now that the spear is
whole, it will try and lure

135
00:06:59,884 --> 00:07:01,550
each of us to use it.

136
00:07:01,552 --> 00:07:06,722
It will draw on our weaknesses,
our desires, our regrets.

137
00:07:06,724 --> 00:07:09,892
It will promise each of us
that we can remake the world

138
00:07:09,894 --> 00:07:12,477
just as we want it.

139
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,396
Well, what's wrong with that?

140
00:07:14,398 --> 00:07:16,148
What? Oh, come on.

141
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,399
You're all thinking it.

142
00:07:17,401 --> 00:07:19,985
Absolute power corrupts, Mr. Rory.

143
00:07:19,987 --> 00:07:21,620
Even when used with the best intentions,

144
00:07:21,622 --> 00:07:24,323
which is why I'd attempted to destroy it.

145
00:07:24,325 --> 00:07:26,491
Well, maybe you didn't try hard enough.

146
00:07:26,493 --> 00:07:28,994
No, no, no, no, no!

147
00:07:28,996 --> 00:07:30,412
Not on the ship, bro!

148
00:07:30,414 --> 00:07:33,498
You said destroy, so I destroyed.

149
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,751
It's not destroyed. It's not even charred.

150
00:07:35,753 --> 00:07:37,419
Any harm brought upon
the spear is temporary.

151
00:07:37,421 --> 00:07:39,087
It will always heal itself.

152
00:07:39,089 --> 00:07:41,173
That's why you had to
keep the pieces separated.

153
00:07:41,175 --> 00:07:44,476
Yes, accomplished with much
effort and numerous explosives.

154
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:45,677
Wait a sec.

155
00:07:45,679 --> 00:07:48,180
There's something written on it.

156
00:07:48,182 --> 00:07:50,682
That's odd.

157
00:07:50,684 --> 00:07:52,351
That wasn't there before.

158
00:07:52,353 --> 00:07:54,519
It must have been revealed by the flames.

159
00:07:54,521 --> 00:07:57,105
Hmm, see, I did help.

160
00:07:57,107 --> 00:08:02,327
"Natum de sanguine, perditus a sanguine."

161
00:08:02,329 --> 00:08:04,529
Anyone know Latin?

162
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:10,035
"Natum de sanguine, perditus a sanguine."

163
00:08:10,037 --> 00:08:12,454
Yes, but what does that mean?

164
00:08:12,456 --> 00:08:15,040
"Born of blood, undone by blood."

165
00:08:15,042 --> 00:08:16,592
And what does that mean?

166
00:08:16,594 --> 00:08:18,460
- It...
- Look, we finally

167
00:08:18,462 --> 00:08:19,928
have the spear.

168
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,546
We just need to figure
out what to do with it.

169
00:08:21,548 --> 00:08:23,682
We need to determine a way to protect it.

170
00:08:23,684 --> 00:08:25,684
You don't.

171
00:08:25,686 --> 00:08:27,102
You destroy it.

172
00:08:27,104 --> 00:08:28,887
Yes, well, I've tried that, Dr. Heywood.

173
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:30,272
It is impervious to destruction.

174
00:08:30,274 --> 00:08:33,058
No, it's not.

175
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:36,395
"Born of blood, undone by blood."

176
00:08:36,397 --> 00:08:38,447
Pretend we're not historians.

177
00:08:38,449 --> 00:08:40,532
"Born of blood" because the blood of Christ

178
00:08:40,534 --> 00:08:41,783
gave the spear power.

179
00:08:41,785 --> 00:08:44,736
"Undone by blood" because
the blood of Christ

180
00:08:44,738 --> 00:08:46,538
is the only thing that can destroy it.

181
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,740
Now you're talking.

182
00:08:48,742 --> 00:08:50,792
Gideon, plot a course for the Crucifixion.

183
00:08:50,794 --> 00:08:52,744
- Yes, Cap...
- Don't you dare, Gideon.

184
00:08:52,746 --> 00:08:55,747
Look, throughout history,
there are certain moments

185
00:08:55,749 --> 00:08:58,550
whose integrity are crucial.

186
00:08:58,552 --> 00:09:00,252
The birth, life, and death of Jesus Christ

187
00:09:00,254 --> 00:09:01,753
are all such moments.

188
00:09:01,755 --> 00:09:04,423
Any interference, no matter
how miniscule, could have

189
00:09:04,425 --> 00:09:06,892
disastrous consequences
for the time stream.

190
00:09:06,894 --> 00:09:09,478
We cannot go there. Ever.

191
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,763
Look, I understand that,
but if this is the only way

192
00:09:11,765 --> 00:09:12,931
to destroy the spear...

193
00:09:12,933 --> 00:09:14,433
It's not.

194
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,186
It's not the only way.

195
00:09:18,188 --> 00:09:21,073
Now, I'm not a historian,
but I can't imagine

196
00:09:21,075 --> 00:09:23,358
it's possible to obtain the blood of Christ

197
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,110
without Christ.

198
00:09:25,112 --> 00:09:28,447
Actually, it is.

199
00:09:30,534 --> 00:09:34,202
I did a year abroad at Oxford
while working on my Masters,

200
00:09:34,204 --> 00:09:37,789
and in between dating this
girl, Wendy, I remember reading

201
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,926
this unpublished paper
by this classics scholar

202
00:09:40,928 --> 00:09:42,461
from early 20th century.

203
00:09:42,463 --> 00:09:46,014
Now, this scholar had
this far-fetched theory

204
00:09:46,016 --> 00:09:48,350
about Sir Gawain, that the knight returned

205
00:09:48,352 --> 00:09:51,353
from the Crusades not with the Holy Grail,

206
00:09:51,355 --> 00:09:54,856
but with something far more valuable.

207
00:09:54,858 --> 00:09:56,942
- The blood of Christ.
- Exactly.

208
00:09:56,944 --> 00:09:59,945
Now, the paper went on to
theorize that Gawain had

209
00:09:59,947 --> 00:10:02,230
a vial of this precious substance on him

210
00:10:02,232 --> 00:10:04,232
up to his death and was buried with it

211
00:10:04,234 --> 00:10:06,985
somewhere in the North of France.

212
00:10:06,987 --> 00:10:08,870
Just somewhere in the North of France?

213
00:10:08,872 --> 00:10:10,205
That's a big area.

214
00:10:10,207 --> 00:10:12,124
I know, but if anyone, and I mean anyone,

215
00:10:12,126 --> 00:10:14,576
knows where to start looking,

216
00:10:14,578 --> 00:10:17,662
it's this guy.

217
00:10:17,664 --> 00:10:19,881
"The Burden of the Purest Heart:

218
00:10:19,883 --> 00:10:25,387
Sir Gawain's Secret
Treasure," written by...

219
00:10:25,389 --> 00:10:30,308
- John Ronald Reuel Tolkien.
- You're kidding.

220
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:33,011
The guy who wrote "The Hobbit"
and "The Lord of the Rings."

221
00:10:33,013 --> 00:10:35,764
John Tolkien was in the
North of France in 1916

222
00:10:35,766 --> 00:10:37,766
during the Battle of the
Somme as a Second Lieutenant

223
00:10:37,768 --> 00:10:39,518
in World War I.

224
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:43,021
Well, looks like we're going back to war.

225
00:10:49,781 --> 00:10:52,115
Temper, temper.

226
00:10:52,117 --> 00:10:53,817
Don't test me, Damien!

227
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,485
Shouldn't it be the other way around?

228
00:10:55,487 --> 00:10:58,738
You sent me and Malcolm off
to find the Kalabros Manuscript

229
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,207
while the Legends managed to abscond

230
00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:01,992
with the Spear of Destiny.

231
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,743
I should have that zombie Speedster

232
00:11:03,745 --> 00:11:06,663
you're so afraid of eat your brain.

233
00:11:06,665 --> 00:11:08,331
No.

234
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:11,885
No, this is actually
a positive development.

235
00:11:11,887 --> 00:11:13,753
Or maybe he already has.

236
00:11:13,755 --> 00:11:16,473
With the entire spear in
the Legends' possession,

237
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:18,842
we no longer have to keep
going after it piecemeal.

238
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,261
Yeah, I'm a glass half-full kind of guy...

239
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:23,179
The legendary idiots
won't be able to use it.

240
00:11:23,181 --> 00:11:25,015
They'll either try to
hide it or destroy it,

241
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:29,519
and when they do, we'll be there, waiting.

242
00:11:29,521 --> 00:11:31,571
- No.
- Excuse me?

243
00:11:31,573 --> 00:11:33,189
Not just us.

244
00:11:33,191 --> 00:11:35,408
I'm not sure if you're
keeping score, Eobard,

245
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,776
but we're losing.

246
00:11:36,778 --> 00:11:40,196
So it's time to change the game.

247
00:11:47,539 --> 00:11:49,623
All right, we gotta be careful.

248
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,875
The Battle of the Somme was
one of the bloodiest conflicts

249
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,176
in human history.

250
00:11:53,178 --> 00:11:54,711
Sounds terrible. I'm in.

251
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:56,296
We're all in.

252
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:57,964
It's not gonna be easy
finding Tolkien in this mess.

253
00:11:57,966 --> 00:11:59,716
According to military records,

254
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:02,135
Second Lieutenant Tolkien
contracted trench fever

255
00:12:02,137 --> 00:12:04,437
and was transferred to a
first aid outpost to await

256
00:12:04,439 --> 00:12:05,939
transportation back to Britain.

257
00:12:05,941 --> 00:12:08,558
Perfect. Amaya, take the Backstreet Boys,

258
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,727
intercept Tolkien, find out what he knows,

259
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:11,861
send him on his way.

260
00:12:11,863 --> 00:12:13,229
So what'd you want us to do?

261
00:12:13,231 --> 00:12:14,981
Guard the spear.

262
00:12:14,983 --> 00:12:17,067
Somebody has to be with
the spear at all times.

263
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,235
Indeed, now that the spear
has been reconstituted,

264
00:12:19,237 --> 00:12:21,237
the stakes have never been greater.

265
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:24,741
Which is why I should stay on the ship too.

266
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:27,043
You okay?

267
00:12:27,045 --> 00:12:28,745
I'm fine.

268
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:31,414
All right, in that case, go with the guys.

269
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:34,167
They could use the adult supervision.

270
00:12:42,177 --> 00:12:46,479
We're at the outpost. God, it's a madhouse.

271
00:12:46,481 --> 00:12:47,647
Fan out to cover more ground.

272
00:12:47,649 --> 00:12:50,016
Stay on the coms and be careful.

273
00:12:50,018 --> 00:12:51,901
Yeah, Gideon said Tolkien was ill.

274
00:12:51,903 --> 00:12:54,237
We should search amongst the injured.

275
00:12:54,239 --> 00:12:58,441
Mr. Rory, Ms. Jiwe, you go look in triage.

276
00:12:58,443 --> 00:13:01,244
Let me guess. We get the fun part?

277
00:13:01,246 --> 00:13:03,246
I've always wanted to visit the Somme.

278
00:13:03,248 --> 00:13:07,117
Just without, you know,
all the warfare going on.

279
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:10,420
Amaya, any sign of Tolkien?

280
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,540
I... I don't know.

281
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:16,292
There's so much suffering.

282
00:13:16,294 --> 00:13:18,845
So many injured.

283
00:13:24,936 --> 00:13:27,804
Miss, please, help me.

284
00:13:31,226 --> 00:13:33,610
Just try to stay still.

285
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,528
Let me see what we're dealing with.

286
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:37,781
Nurse, change these bandages, will you?

287
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:42,235
I don't want to die alone.

288
00:13:42,237 --> 00:13:43,737
You won't.

289
00:13:48,326 --> 00:13:50,577
Here.

290
00:13:54,299 --> 00:13:57,250
Hey, those are for them.

291
00:14:22,694 --> 00:14:27,664
My, my, my, how the mighty have fallen.

292
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,283
You said that the last time you appeared.

293
00:14:30,285 --> 00:14:32,836
Huh, you pick a hell of a time to show up.

294
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:34,454
I'm kind of in the middle of something.

295
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:36,539
Yeah, in the middle of
being a good little doggie

296
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:40,210
to those insufferable wannabes.

297
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,512
Stay on mission, now.

298
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:44,380
Gotta find this hobbit guy.

299
00:14:44,382 --> 00:14:46,599
J.R.R. Tolkien, why?

300
00:14:46,601 --> 00:14:47,884
Hoping for an autograph?

301
00:14:47,886 --> 00:14:49,552
I don't even know who that guy is.

302
00:14:49,554 --> 00:14:51,638
All I know is I gotta find
this hobbit guy who knows

303
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,973
the guy who's buried with Jesus' blood.

304
00:14:53,975 --> 00:14:57,227
Then we can destroy the Spear of Destiny.

305
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:00,396
Mick, Mick, Mick, when have
we ever destroyed anything

306
00:15:00,398 --> 00:15:03,533
we've ever stolen, let
alone the most valuable score

307
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:04,534
in the universe?

308
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:06,786
What have they done to you?

309
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,573
How the hell are we supposed
to find anyone in here?

310
00:15:10,575 --> 00:15:12,075
- What?
- I said, how the hell

311
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,543
are we sup...

312
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:15,662
On your feet, you
lazy good-for-nothings,

313
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:17,831
or I'll have you shot!

314
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,833
Did you hear me, Lieutenant?

315
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:23,052
- Yes, sir.
- On your feet with your weapon,

316
00:15:23,054 --> 00:15:25,755
you fool of a Tolkien! On your feet!

317
00:15:25,757 --> 00:15:28,808
Tolkien, Lieutenant Tolkien?

318
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:31,060
Yes, yes, that's me.

319
00:15:31,062 --> 00:15:34,597
He's very ill. He's gotta come with us.

320
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:36,983
Nonsense, I... I'm perfectly fine.

321
00:15:36,985 --> 00:15:38,985
- Whoa.
- Oh.

322
00:15:38,987 --> 00:15:41,070
This man is burning with a fever.

323
00:15:41,072 --> 00:15:42,405
We're taking him out of here now!

324
00:15:42,407 --> 00:15:44,073
Well, get him to the field hospital.

325
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,861
Come on, you trench rats!

326
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:50,280
The boys have a date
with your bitter steel!

327
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,415
We have him, but he's
in no condition to talk.

328
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:54,367
All right, get him to the extraction point.

329
00:15:54,369 --> 00:15:56,452
- We'll meet you there.
- Mr. Rory?

330
00:15:56,454 --> 00:15:58,171
Steal us an ambulance, will you?

331
00:15:58,173 --> 00:15:59,422
On it.

332
00:15:59,424 --> 00:16:00,957
What happened to the man who never

333
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,459
took orders from anyone?

334
00:16:03,461 --> 00:16:05,461
I respected the hell out of that guy.

335
00:16:05,463 --> 00:16:08,131
Now you're just their trained pet.

336
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,632
Sit, Mick. Fetch, Mick.

337
00:16:09,634 --> 00:16:11,935
Good boy, Mick. Woof!

338
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:14,137
I'm no one's... pet.

339
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,139
Sure you are.

340
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,107
They may act all friendly to you,

341
00:16:18,109 --> 00:16:19,976
but they'll never trust you, never.

342
00:16:19,978 --> 00:16:21,611
When the chips are
down, they'll look at you

343
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:26,616
the same way they always have: as a thug.

344
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:30,320
But you and me? We're partners.

345
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:34,073
At least, we were, and could be again.

346
00:16:34,075 --> 00:16:36,376
Take the Spear of Destiny,
Mick. Use it for yourself.

347
00:16:36,378 --> 00:16:38,161
- Use it for us.
- There is no us.

348
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,913
- You're dead.
- I don't have to be, Mick.

349
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:43,082
With the spear, it'd be
so easy to bring me back.

350
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,502
You're in my head. You're a...

351
00:16:46,504 --> 00:16:48,471
you're an illumination.

352
00:16:48,473 --> 00:16:51,808
- A hallucination.
- That's it.

353
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,097
Now, did that feel like a hallucination?

354
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,238
I must be hallucinating.

355
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,761
Actually, we took the liberty of curing

356
00:17:12,763 --> 00:17:15,276
your typhoid fever, Lieutenant Tolkien.

357
00:17:15,278 --> 00:17:16,657
You.

358
00:17:16,659 --> 00:17:18,787
I knew you weren't volunteers.

359
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:20,873
Your accent alone was horrendous.

360
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,508
I'll have you know I played Bert

361
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,960
in my middle school production
of "Mary Poppins," thank you.

362
00:17:24,962 --> 00:17:27,546
Who are you, then? German?

363
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:29,381
Ottoman? And where on God's Earth

364
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:30,716
have you brought me?

365
00:17:30,718 --> 00:17:32,518
Somewhere the less
talked about, the better,

366
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,186
- for your sake.
- But we're on your side,

367
00:17:34,188 --> 00:17:35,471
and we need your help.

368
00:17:35,473 --> 00:17:37,389
In your paper, "The Burden
of the Purest Heart,"

369
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:40,192
you described the final
resting place of Sir Gawain.

370
00:17:40,194 --> 00:17:42,528
I never actually published
that paper... how did you...?

371
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,229
It's hard to explain,
but we need to know where

372
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:45,698
the knight is buried.

373
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,399
You abducted me from the
middle of a battlefield

374
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:49,034
to ask about an old myth?

375
00:17:49,036 --> 00:17:50,569
There is a war on, you fools!

376
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:52,621
And I imagine that the
view from the trenches

377
00:17:52,623 --> 00:17:54,490
is pretty bleak.

378
00:17:54,492 --> 00:17:56,125
It looks to me like the end of the world.

379
00:17:56,127 --> 00:17:58,077
But it's not. Believe me,

380
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:00,879
this darkness will pass.

381
00:18:00,881 --> 00:18:03,549
You speak as someone who's seen the future.

382
00:18:03,551 --> 00:18:05,751
Haven't all students of history?

383
00:18:05,753 --> 00:18:07,052
Those who suffer heal.

384
00:18:07,054 --> 00:18:09,054
Everything destroyed gets rebuilt.

385
00:18:09,056 --> 00:18:12,257
And our towers grow a
little taller every time.

386
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:14,093
I should like to believe you.

387
00:18:14,095 --> 00:18:17,396
Tell me, why do you
seek the grave of Gawain?

388
00:18:17,398 --> 00:18:20,566
Eh... it's a long story.

389
00:18:20,568 --> 00:18:21,934
I enjoy long stories.

390
00:18:21,936 --> 00:18:24,369
Yeah, he does.

391
00:18:24,371 --> 00:18:25,938
In short, my fellow travelers and I...

392
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,406
Fellowship, if you will.

393
00:18:27,408 --> 00:18:30,192
We're on a journey to destroy an object.

394
00:18:30,194 --> 00:18:33,979
One which would bring the
bearer unimaginable power.

395
00:18:33,981 --> 00:18:36,532
Have you heard of the Spear of Destiny?

396
00:18:36,534 --> 00:18:40,702
I came across numerous obscure
references to it in my studies.

397
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:42,421
Of course, such a divine artifact

398
00:18:42,423 --> 00:18:43,455
could never actually exist.

399
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:44,923
But it does.

400
00:18:44,925 --> 00:18:48,177
And we need your help to end its threat.

401
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:50,512
I left all my research at Oxford.

402
00:18:50,514 --> 00:18:53,766
To help you, I would need a vast library.

403
00:18:53,768 --> 00:18:56,718
Well, lucky for you, we brought one.

404
00:19:06,781 --> 00:19:08,730
How'd it go out there?

405
00:19:11,986 --> 00:19:13,152
Amaya?

406
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:17,539
It was worse than any nightmare.

407
00:19:22,213 --> 00:19:24,830
You've seen this before.

408
00:19:24,832 --> 00:19:28,300
In World War II, it's definitely
a situation where the sequel

409
00:19:28,302 --> 00:19:30,302
was worse than the original.

410
00:19:30,304 --> 00:19:32,254
What changed?

411
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:36,758
I had Gideon show me the historical record.

412
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,645
My future.

413
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:42,147
How much did you see?

414
00:19:42,149 --> 00:19:45,767
My village burned to the ground.

415
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:47,820
My daughter turned into a refugee.

416
00:19:47,822 --> 00:19:52,157
And her daughter turned into an orphan.

417
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:57,830
Seeing the battlefield today,
it just made it so real.

418
00:19:57,832 --> 00:20:00,115
I'm so sorry.

419
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:08,507
But, if it helps, from
what my sister told me,

420
00:20:08,509 --> 00:20:11,710
despite all the pain and
suffering your granddaughter

421
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:13,212
will endure...

422
00:20:15,216 --> 00:20:19,101
She turns out to be a
pretty remarkable person.

423
00:20:19,103 --> 00:20:20,302
A hero.

424
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:37,903
Don't even think about it!

425
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:41,123
That is not a scratcher of any variety.

426
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,574
What happened to your face?

427
00:20:42,576 --> 00:20:44,576
I saw Snart again.

428
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:47,412
More likely, you took a
nasty blow on the battlefield.

429
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:50,249
Perhaps you're suffering
some minor brain damage or,

430
00:20:50,251 --> 00:20:52,251
at least, more brain damage.

431
00:20:52,253 --> 00:20:53,969
Snart did this!

432
00:20:53,971 --> 00:20:56,171
I believe you.

433
00:20:56,173 --> 00:20:57,890
- You do?
- Of course not.

434
00:20:57,892 --> 00:21:00,058
I just don't want you to hurt me.

435
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,927
But, given our trip to the Vanishing Point,

436
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:05,264
it would make sense that
he'd be in your thoughts.

437
00:21:05,266 --> 00:21:08,600
Mick, let him go.

438
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:10,185
You're going to church.

439
00:21:10,187 --> 00:21:11,770
I'm not the religious type.

440
00:21:11,772 --> 00:21:13,772
Tolkien's located Gawain's burial place.

441
00:21:13,774 --> 00:21:15,607
It's in a cathedral in Amiens.

442
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:16,909
If it's still there.

443
00:21:16,911 --> 00:21:19,244
The war's already passed through.

444
00:21:19,246 --> 00:21:20,529
Are you sure you're up for this?

445
00:21:20,531 --> 00:21:22,164
Yes.

446
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:27,619
Snart, he... he's in my head, right?

447
00:21:34,261 --> 00:21:35,928
The Church of Amiens.

448
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:38,547
Built in the 1600s, for centuries,

449
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:40,716
it was a shelter, a refuge.

450
00:21:40,718 --> 00:21:43,602
Now just a place for
marauding armies to squat.

451
00:21:43,604 --> 00:21:45,354
Look closely, but be careful.

452
00:21:45,356 --> 00:21:47,105
Returning knights of
the Crusades were known

453
00:21:47,107 --> 00:21:49,858
to hide their relics so only
the worthy could find them.

454
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:54,146
They set traps for those
who aren't so worthy.

455
00:21:54,148 --> 00:21:55,480
Aw, they're so close,

456
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:57,649
finishing each others' dire warnings.

457
00:21:57,651 --> 00:22:00,202
- Ha.
- Think I found something.

458
00:22:03,157 --> 00:22:05,907
It's gotta be worth a fortune.

459
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:07,960
- Gold.
- Yeah, don't bite the relics.

460
00:22:07,962 --> 00:22:10,495
- Give me that.
- And don't steal the relics.

461
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:12,798
Now, if I'm not mistaken,

462
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,666
the inscription's written in...

463
00:22:16,837 --> 00:22:19,671
Proto-Celtic.

464
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:23,892
It says, "Follow the outlier,
then push further still."

465
00:22:23,894 --> 00:22:25,761
But what is the outlier?

466
00:22:31,602 --> 00:22:34,936
Three rubies, one emerald.

467
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:36,855
I think I found our outlier.

468
00:22:36,857 --> 00:22:38,774
"Then push further still."

469
00:22:41,862 --> 00:22:44,780
This structure's been
damaged from all the fighting.

470
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:55,707
Sir Gawain, I presume.

471
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:58,927
Hey, look, on his
shield, it's an engraving.

472
00:22:58,929 --> 00:23:03,348
Pretty pathetic, if you ask me.

473
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,387
Mr. Snart?

474
00:23:08,389 --> 00:23:11,773
Wait, you can see him?

475
00:23:11,775 --> 00:23:13,308
You're supposed to be dead.

476
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:15,644
Yeah, they told me all about how I get soft

477
00:23:15,646 --> 00:23:19,231
and die for you losers.
I didn't believe them.

478
00:23:19,233 --> 00:23:20,699
Believe who?

479
00:23:20,701 --> 00:23:23,568
Well, if that's not an entrance line,

480
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:25,570
I don't know what is.

481
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:27,873
What is going on here?

482
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:30,242
The Legion must have traveled back in time

483
00:23:30,244 --> 00:23:33,912
and picked up Mr. Snart
before he joined the Legends.

484
00:23:33,914 --> 00:23:35,747
He told us all about
your plan on how you're

485
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:37,582
going to destroy the spear.

486
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:39,418
Thanks for the tip, Mick.

487
00:23:41,255 --> 00:23:42,721
I didn't think he was real.

488
00:23:42,723 --> 00:23:45,340
No, no, no, no. No need to defend yourself.

489
00:23:45,342 --> 00:23:46,975
Actually, there is.

490
00:23:46,977 --> 00:23:48,060
Angriff!

491
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:50,896
Get behind me!

492
00:23:53,484 --> 00:23:54,933
What is this madness?

493
00:23:56,236 --> 00:23:57,486
Aah!

494
00:23:57,488 --> 00:23:58,937
What are you?

495
00:24:00,441 --> 00:24:01,656
Aah!

496
00:24:06,947 --> 00:24:08,447
What are you doing? We gotta go!

497
00:24:08,449 --> 00:24:10,198
Not without the engraving!

498
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:20,792
You actually care about these losers.

499
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:23,345
Mick, come on, let's go!

500
00:24:23,347 --> 00:24:26,681
Because I guarantee they
don't care about you, Mick.

501
00:24:30,634 --> 00:24:32,483
So Snart's alive.

502
00:24:32,485 --> 00:24:34,126
And he's working with the Legion.

503
00:24:34,128 --> 00:24:36,103
Well, it's not just the Legion,

504
00:24:36,105 --> 00:24:37,321
is it, Mick?

505
00:24:37,323 --> 00:24:38,906
You got something to say to me?

506
00:24:38,908 --> 00:24:41,192
You told him about our
plan to destroy the spear.

507
00:24:41,194 --> 00:24:43,327
Well, I thought I was seeing things.

508
00:24:43,329 --> 00:24:45,746
Whether Mr. Snart was
a hallucination or not,

509
00:24:45,748 --> 00:24:48,533
the fact that you told him
about our plan speaks volumes.

510
00:24:48,535 --> 00:24:50,501
Volumes of what, Professor?

511
00:24:50,503 --> 00:24:53,504
I think what Martin is trying
to say is that he's worried

512
00:24:53,506 --> 00:24:55,039
that, if it came down to a decision

513
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:56,374
between Leonard and us...

514
00:24:56,376 --> 00:24:58,543
You would choose Snart in a heartbeat.

515
00:24:58,545 --> 00:25:00,761
Yeah, I would. He's a friend,

516
00:25:00,763 --> 00:25:03,714
and you guys ain't exactly
being friendly right now.

517
00:25:03,716 --> 00:25:05,433
Can you blame us?

518
00:25:05,435 --> 00:25:08,553
We're concerned that your
blunder with Mr. Snart

519
00:25:08,555 --> 00:25:10,521
confirms that you haven't truly given up

520
00:25:10,523 --> 00:25:14,058
your roots as a... thug.

521
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,527
Oh.

522
00:25:16,529 --> 00:25:19,730
That what you think, Captain?

523
00:25:19,732 --> 00:25:21,983
Mick, we just need you to be careful.

524
00:25:21,985 --> 00:25:23,150
Why?

525
00:25:26,239 --> 00:25:28,956
Oh, I see.

526
00:25:28,958 --> 00:25:32,660
In your eyes, I'm always
gonna be a... criminal.

527
00:25:35,715 --> 00:25:38,883
This is fascinating.

528
00:25:38,885 --> 00:25:42,887
Apparently the spear will glow
in the presence of divine blood.

529
00:25:42,889 --> 00:25:44,589
Yeah, and it also revealed
the message when Mick

530
00:25:44,591 --> 00:25:45,756
lit it on fire.

531
00:25:45,758 --> 00:25:47,508
A secret only fire can tell.

532
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:49,427
How marvelous.

533
00:25:49,429 --> 00:25:51,062
So, unless you wanna wander all over France

534
00:25:51,064 --> 00:25:52,897
waiting for this thing
to light up, I suggest

535
00:25:52,899 --> 00:25:54,232
we figure out this map.

536
00:25:58,238 --> 00:25:59,570
You okay?

537
00:25:59,572 --> 00:26:00,605
I'm afraid I suffer from what is known

538
00:26:00,607 --> 00:26:03,357
in the trenches as "shell shock,"

539
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:06,827
although some would prefer
to call it "common cowardice."

540
00:26:06,829 --> 00:26:09,413
Said the guy who dodged
bullets to get a grave rubbing.

541
00:26:09,415 --> 00:26:10,948
Give me a break.

542
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:15,620
Proof I belong in a
library, and not on a...

543
00:26:15,622 --> 00:26:18,789
battlefield.

544
00:26:18,791 --> 00:26:21,626
I know where we have to
go to destroy the spear.

545
00:26:21,628 --> 00:26:23,961
Where?

546
00:26:23,963 --> 00:26:26,464
The middle of hell on Earth.

547
00:26:37,477 --> 00:26:39,560
You hear them too, huh?

548
00:26:39,562 --> 00:26:42,280
I'm sorry?

549
00:26:42,282 --> 00:26:44,398
The voices.

550
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,817
What's the spear saying to you?

551
00:26:46,819 --> 00:26:49,537
It's not the spear. It's my mother.

552
00:26:49,539 --> 00:26:51,822
Her voice, at least.

553
00:26:51,824 --> 00:26:55,242
She's begging me to help our people.

554
00:26:55,244 --> 00:26:59,497
To keep our family and our legacy safe.

555
00:26:59,499 --> 00:27:02,249
She wants me to change my destiny.

556
00:27:02,251 --> 00:27:06,971
Maybe the spear can do that for her.

557
00:27:06,973 --> 00:27:08,839
The chance to rewrite reality.

558
00:27:08,841 --> 00:27:11,842
Who wouldn't be tempted?

559
00:27:11,844 --> 00:27:13,844
What do you hear?

560
00:27:15,848 --> 00:27:17,848
My parents.

561
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:19,984
What are they saying?

562
00:27:19,986 --> 00:27:23,604
"Don't play with fire, Mick."

563
00:27:23,606 --> 00:27:26,857
Mick, Amaya, I need you in here.

564
00:27:29,954 --> 00:27:31,236
So, it looks like our historians

565
00:27:31,238 --> 00:27:32,988
have made a discovery.

566
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:35,074
According to this map, the blood of Christ

567
00:27:35,076 --> 00:27:37,710
is hidden right smack in
the middle of no-man's land.

568
00:27:37,712 --> 00:27:39,828
Great, right at the center
of the bloodiest battle

569
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,547
in human history.

570
00:27:41,549 --> 00:27:43,415
Even if we were to make it
through the terrain unscathed,

571
00:27:43,417 --> 00:27:45,718
there's still the issue of
the blood's precise location.

572
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,302
That's the good news.

573
00:27:47,304 --> 00:27:50,672
Just as the spear acted as
a diving rod for its pieces,

574
00:27:50,674 --> 00:27:53,258
it glows when it's close to Jesus' blood.

575
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:56,512
But one cannot simply walk
into the middle of a war zone.

576
00:27:56,514 --> 00:27:58,897
What if we convinced both
sides to stop fighting

577
00:27:58,899 --> 00:28:00,599
long enough for us to get in there?

578
00:28:00,601 --> 00:28:03,602
That'll never work.

579
00:28:03,604 --> 00:28:05,437
But there is another way.

580
00:28:05,439 --> 00:28:07,439
We can rewrite reality.

581
00:28:07,441 --> 00:28:08,941
Eliminate the threat of the Legion

582
00:28:08,943 --> 00:28:10,492
once and for all time.

583
00:28:10,494 --> 00:28:11,527
No, we can't.

584
00:28:11,529 --> 00:28:12,945
This is just a tool.

585
00:28:12,947 --> 00:28:14,530
In the right hands, in our hands,

586
00:28:14,532 --> 00:28:17,199
- we can use it for good.
- But the spear has more power

587
00:28:17,201 --> 00:28:19,284
than any of us could possibly wield.

588
00:28:19,286 --> 00:28:23,789
I know a thing or two about
wielding mystical artifacts.

589
00:28:23,791 --> 00:28:25,257
I can control it.

590
00:28:25,259 --> 00:28:26,759
Look, a totem is one thing,

591
00:28:26,761 --> 00:28:30,212
but that... that is more powerful

592
00:28:30,214 --> 00:28:32,631
than anything any of us have seen.

593
00:28:32,633 --> 00:28:34,183
She said she can handle it.

594
00:28:34,185 --> 00:28:35,968
Mick, not now.

595
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:38,937
Amaya, look, you don't know
what the spear can do to you.

596
00:28:38,939 --> 00:28:42,024
Having the ability to
rewrite your own reality...

597
00:28:42,026 --> 00:28:44,610
it's too much temptation for anyone.

598
00:28:44,612 --> 00:28:48,230
That's why we have to do this the hard way.

599
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:53,786
All right, hard way it is.

600
00:28:53,788 --> 00:28:55,988
I'm in.

601
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:59,041
Yeah, I'm down.

602
00:28:59,043 --> 00:29:00,993
It's the right thing to do.

603
00:29:04,381 --> 00:29:06,999
Obviously, I've been outvoted.

604
00:29:07,001 --> 00:29:10,335
I will help you in whatever way I can.

605
00:29:10,337 --> 00:29:13,672
But I think you're making a huge mistake.

606
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,846
Incoming!

607
00:29:20,848 --> 00:29:22,264
Aah!

608
00:29:25,269 --> 00:29:27,269
Coming through! Coming through!

609
00:29:27,271 --> 00:29:30,790
According to this map, Jesus' blood

610
00:29:30,792 --> 00:29:32,441
is somewhere over there.

611
00:29:32,443 --> 00:29:34,360
The spear is sensing the blood.

612
00:29:34,362 --> 00:29:37,113
We won't last five minutes out there.

613
00:29:37,115 --> 00:29:39,031
It's not too late to use it.

614
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:42,418
Loser.

615
00:29:47,208 --> 00:29:50,459
Commander, we may request
a moment of your time.

616
00:29:50,461 --> 00:29:51,794
We are in the midst of battle.

617
00:29:51,796 --> 00:29:55,014
There are no moments... Lieutenant Tolkien.

618
00:29:55,016 --> 00:29:57,183
I was told you were
suffering from trench fever,

619
00:29:57,185 --> 00:29:59,769
and you better be, or else
I report you as a deserter.

620
00:29:59,771 --> 00:30:02,638
Captain Hunter, Royal Army Medical Corps.

621
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,058
Now, I can assure you that
this man is no deserter.

622
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,943
As such, we have an urgent entreaty.

623
00:30:07,945 --> 00:30:09,361
We need you to contact German command

624
00:30:09,363 --> 00:30:10,479
and request a ceasefire.

625
00:30:10,481 --> 00:30:12,064
How dare you waste my time?

626
00:30:12,066 --> 00:30:13,315
We're on the verge of taking Guillemont.

627
00:30:13,317 --> 00:30:14,733
Guillemont can wait.

628
00:30:14,735 --> 00:30:15,985
There is a greater battle at hand,

629
00:30:15,987 --> 00:30:18,070
one that concerns all of humanity.

630
00:30:18,072 --> 00:30:19,655
Both sides must lay down their arms,

631
00:30:19,657 --> 00:30:22,491
or all shall be lost.

632
00:30:22,493 --> 00:30:26,796
Sir, latest casualty report.

633
00:30:26,798 --> 00:30:28,831
2,300 dead.

634
00:30:28,833 --> 00:30:32,802
Nearly 8,000 wounded.

635
00:30:32,804 --> 00:30:35,971
All has already been lost.

636
00:30:38,976 --> 00:30:40,176
Mm.

637
00:30:42,847 --> 00:30:44,847
Perhaps our friends on the Germans' side

638
00:30:44,849 --> 00:30:47,483
are having more luck.

639
00:30:49,237 --> 00:30:51,320
You wish for me to order our artillery

640
00:30:51,322 --> 00:30:53,105
to stop shelling the enemy?

641
00:30:53,107 --> 00:30:55,157
Just long enough for
us to rescue the wounded

642
00:30:55,159 --> 00:30:56,442
from the battlefield.

643
00:30:56,444 --> 00:30:58,194
And so the British can rescue theirs.

644
00:31:02,366 --> 00:31:04,867
I will order our batteries to stop firing

645
00:31:04,869 --> 00:31:08,337
when they stop firing on us.

646
00:31:08,339 --> 00:31:11,173
It seems neither side
wants to give up the fight.

647
00:31:11,175 --> 00:31:13,342
We don't have time, not
with the Legion on our tails.

648
00:31:13,344 --> 00:31:14,293
We have to push forward.

649
00:31:14,295 --> 00:31:16,178
Advance, soldiers!

650
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:19,215
Up the ladders, over the top, let's go!

651
00:31:21,052 --> 00:31:22,718
The British are advancing.

652
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,020
Now's our best chance to move.

653
00:31:25,022 --> 00:31:26,889
It's all on us now.

654
00:31:26,891 --> 00:31:29,608
Watch each others' backs, and
we'll make it to the ship alive.

655
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:31,393
Understood?

656
00:31:52,917 --> 00:31:54,416
Oh!

657
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:00,839
We're getting closer!

658
00:32:03,261 --> 00:32:06,478
What is it with me and Nazis?

659
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,013
Wrong World War, Mick!

660
00:32:08,015 --> 00:32:09,598
These are Huns, not Nazis!

661
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,151
I don't care what you wanna call them,

662
00:32:12,153 --> 00:32:14,320
just take them out, now!

663
00:32:14,322 --> 00:32:15,771
I'm on it.

664
00:32:32,089 --> 00:32:33,789
_

665
00:32:36,043 --> 00:32:37,793
We must be almost on top of it.

666
00:32:37,795 --> 00:32:39,378
That way.

667
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,597
Sir, you need to understand
that this is one problem

668
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:43,599
that cannot be solved with violence.

669
00:32:45,353 --> 00:32:47,219
Okay, maybe a spot of violence.

670
00:32:47,221 --> 00:32:49,555
Well, if he's not gonna give
the order for the ceasefire,

671
00:32:49,557 --> 00:32:50,940
we'll have to.

672
00:32:50,942 --> 00:32:52,524
What frequency are we on?

673
00:32:52,526 --> 00:32:54,560
Um, three megahertz.

674
00:32:54,562 --> 00:32:57,029
Jax, set the Waverider
to receive the signal

675
00:32:57,031 --> 00:33:01,150
and hijack all communication
on the battlefield.

676
00:33:01,152 --> 00:33:02,985
Copy that, pumping the volume.

677
00:33:08,209 --> 00:33:10,409
Attention all combatants.

678
00:33:10,411 --> 00:33:13,329
May I have your attention, please?

679
00:33:14,882 --> 00:33:18,050
There are casualties on the battlefield.

680
00:33:20,838 --> 00:33:23,839
Brave men on both sides
who are in urgent need

681
00:33:23,841 --> 00:33:26,342
of medical attention.

682
00:33:26,344 --> 00:33:29,728
I know that the divisions
between us run deep,

683
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:33,182
that they may very well be insurmountable.

684
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:36,568
But I implore both of our armies

685
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:39,772
for this one moment

686
00:33:39,774 --> 00:33:43,609
to come together as allies
and honor a ceasefire

687
00:33:43,611 --> 00:33:45,444
so that the injured may be removed

688
00:33:45,446 --> 00:33:48,113
from the field of battle.

689
00:33:48,115 --> 00:33:53,419
There may come a day
when our courage fails us,

690
00:33:53,421 --> 00:33:56,171
when we forsake our friendships

691
00:33:56,173 --> 00:33:58,957
and break the bonds of fellowship,

692
00:33:58,959 --> 00:34:03,045
but today is not that day.

693
00:34:03,047 --> 00:34:06,215
And perhaps in showing our humanity...

694
00:34:09,353 --> 00:34:11,470
We might just save it.

695
00:34:26,987 --> 00:34:29,321
It worked.

696
00:34:29,323 --> 00:34:32,241
I can't believe they fell for it.

697
00:34:32,243 --> 00:34:33,992
Let's keep moving.

698
00:34:36,997 --> 00:34:38,914
That's gotta be it.

699
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:02,688
Tolkien was right.

700
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:04,189
The legend's real.

701
00:35:04,191 --> 00:35:05,407
It's the blood of...

702
00:35:05,409 --> 00:35:08,610
Christ, you are so predictable.

703
00:35:08,612 --> 00:35:11,113
Though, I have to admit,
negotiating a ceasefire

704
00:35:11,115 --> 00:35:13,699
in the middle of a World
War? Pretty impressive.

705
00:35:13,701 --> 00:35:16,452
Maybe they'd like to hear our peace terms.

706
00:35:16,454 --> 00:35:18,203
It's quite simple, really.

707
00:35:18,205 --> 00:35:21,673
Hand over the spear, or we kill you.

708
00:35:29,547 --> 00:35:30,763
Sorry, Captain,

709
00:35:30,765 --> 00:35:33,441
but you've reached the end of your quest.

710
00:35:33,443 --> 00:35:35,827
You're right. I'm gonna end this now.

711
00:35:35,829 --> 00:35:39,781
Mick, give me the spear.

712
00:35:39,783 --> 00:35:40,782
Mick.

713
00:35:40,784 --> 00:35:41,906
What are you doing?

714
00:35:41,908 --> 00:35:44,452
Hey, man, we're your friends.

715
00:35:44,454 --> 00:35:45,787
I don't have friends.

716
00:35:45,789 --> 00:35:49,457
But he does have partners.

717
00:35:49,459 --> 00:35:52,844
So what do you say, partner?

718
00:35:52,846 --> 00:35:55,346
Mick, you're better than this.

719
00:35:55,348 --> 00:35:57,098
No, actually, you're not.

720
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:00,468
They may pretend to believe in
you as long as they can use you,

721
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:02,603
but they'll just as soon let you die,

722
00:36:02,605 --> 00:36:04,272
same as they did me.

723
00:36:04,274 --> 00:36:06,641
He's messing with your head, man.

724
00:36:06,643 --> 00:36:08,109
Ever since I've been on that ship,

725
00:36:08,111 --> 00:36:09,644
you people have been trying to change me.

726
00:36:09,646 --> 00:36:11,779
That's not true, Mick.

727
00:36:11,781 --> 00:36:13,314
But guess what?

728
00:36:13,316 --> 00:36:16,451
There are things about
me I wanna change too.

729
00:36:18,405 --> 00:36:20,038
Steel up, Nate. Stop him.

730
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,156
He does, you and animal chick die,

731
00:36:22,158 --> 00:36:23,741
but we still keep the spear.

732
00:36:23,743 --> 00:36:27,161
And we're gonna make
all kinds of fun changes.

733
00:36:27,163 --> 00:36:28,713
You bastard.

734
00:36:28,715 --> 00:36:31,799
Come with me.

735
00:36:31,801 --> 00:36:35,086
The spear can help us
fix your messed up future

736
00:36:35,088 --> 00:36:37,171
and my past.

737
00:36:39,342 --> 00:36:41,592
Never.

738
00:36:41,594 --> 00:36:43,344
If you think we're gonna
let you walk out of here

739
00:36:43,346 --> 00:36:44,645
- with the spear...
- You're right.

740
00:36:44,647 --> 00:36:46,147
You know, we could use a distraction.

741
00:36:46,149 --> 00:36:50,518
I hereby declare that
the armistice is over.

742
00:36:55,108 --> 00:36:56,190
Get down!

743
00:37:01,748 --> 00:37:03,081
Oh, that's just great.

744
00:37:03,083 --> 00:37:04,749
Now we're all gonna die.

745
00:37:04,751 --> 00:37:09,420
Mick, have I ever pulled a
heist without a getaway plan?

746
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:18,679
I wish things could've
been different, Sara.

747
00:37:20,767 --> 00:37:22,550
Get down!

748
00:37:22,552 --> 00:37:24,218
Jax, we need an extraction.

749
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:26,220
Go!

750
00:37:26,222 --> 00:37:27,805
Copy that, I'm in bound.

751
00:37:36,232 --> 00:37:37,615
Aah!

752
00:37:43,156 --> 00:37:44,288
Ah.

753
00:38:02,642 --> 00:38:04,976
Okay, opening the cargo bay doors.

754
00:38:08,097 --> 00:38:09,597
Let's go!

755
00:38:12,819 --> 00:38:14,101
Amaya!

756
00:38:16,439 --> 00:38:18,322
Mick's gone. It's over.

757
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:30,618
We never should have set
foot on that battlefield.

758
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:32,703
We didn't have a choice.

759
00:38:32,705 --> 00:38:34,288
That's not true.

760
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:37,008
There was a choice, and
you made the wrong one,

761
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:39,877
and now the Spear of Destiny,
the most powerful weapon

762
00:38:39,879 --> 00:38:42,597
in all of history, is
in the hands of not one,

763
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:44,298
but four psychopaths.

764
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:47,301
- Don't forget Mr. Rory.
- That's right.

765
00:38:47,303 --> 00:38:50,221
We trusted him, and he screwed us over.

766
00:38:50,223 --> 00:38:52,857
Did we trust him?

767
00:38:52,859 --> 00:38:55,943
I mean, admit it, we never really did,

768
00:38:55,945 --> 00:38:57,528
and he picked up on it.

769
00:38:57,530 --> 00:39:02,283
Yeah, apparently Mr.
Rory's not entirely stupid.

770
00:39:02,285 --> 00:39:04,652
We lied to him.

771
00:39:04,654 --> 00:39:05,653
Not Mick, Tolkien.

772
00:39:05,655 --> 00:39:08,656
We told him there was hope.

773
00:39:08,658 --> 00:39:11,993
That humanity will light its way, but...

774
00:39:11,995 --> 00:39:15,830
we just ended up dumping
him back in the trenches.

775
00:39:15,832 --> 00:39:17,915
We had to restore time.

776
00:39:17,917 --> 00:39:19,584
Although I suppose it
doesn't really much matter

777
00:39:19,586 --> 00:39:21,636
now that reality itself is threatened.

778
00:39:25,508 --> 00:39:27,225
Maybe not.

779
00:39:30,063 --> 00:39:32,513
Last time I checked, there
was not an on/off button

780
00:39:32,515 --> 00:39:35,850
on the spear.

781
00:39:35,852 --> 00:39:39,854
What if... what if they
don't know how to use it?

782
00:39:39,856 --> 00:39:41,022
Oh.

783
00:39:41,024 --> 00:39:44,575
I have to say, well done.

784
00:39:44,577 --> 00:39:46,777
I've heard of your
skills as a thief before,

785
00:39:46,779 --> 00:39:50,164
but this has taken it to a whole new level.

786
00:39:50,166 --> 00:39:54,001
Truly masterful, getting one
of them to steal it for us.

787
00:39:54,003 --> 00:39:55,953
He was never really one of them.

788
00:39:55,955 --> 00:39:58,456
Were you, Mick?

789
00:39:58,458 --> 00:40:00,875
I thought you said the
spear belonged to us.

790
00:40:00,877 --> 00:40:03,010
There's plenty of power to go around.

791
00:40:03,012 --> 00:40:05,129
Thanks for waiting for me.

792
00:40:05,131 --> 00:40:07,214
Seems like I missed a few things.

793
00:40:07,216 --> 00:40:08,299
You found the Kalabros.

794
00:40:08,301 --> 00:40:10,551
The word of God himself.

795
00:40:10,553 --> 00:40:13,554
It's like the owner's manual
for the Spear of Destiny.

796
00:40:13,556 --> 00:40:15,306
It wasn't easy to find.

797
00:40:15,308 --> 00:40:17,141
Now what?

798
00:40:20,947 --> 00:40:22,813
Grab hold.

799
00:40:32,659 --> 00:40:35,409
"B'khi-eel.
