<font color="#27ff24">That is, if he's not already dead.</font>

267
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,365
<font color="#27ff24">Out.</font>

268
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,616
<font color="#27ff24">Everyone out.</font>

269
00:17:57,366 --> 00:17:59,619
<font color="#27ff24">Let's go! Move it!</font>

270
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,344
<font color="#27ff24">This is it, American.</font>

271
00:18:15,426 --> 00:18:16,761
<font color="#27ff24">I hope you're ready.</font>

272
00:18:30,858 --> 00:18:32,486
<font color="#27ff24">What are you all waiting for?</font>

273
00:18:32,568 --> 00:18:33,569
<font color="#27ff24">Move!</font>

274
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,030
<font color="#27ff24">Let's go!</font>

275
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,075
<font color="#27ff24">Move!</font>

276
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,943
<font color="#27ff24">Am I dreaming, American?</font>

277
00:19:14,819 --> 00:19:18,406
<font color="#27ff24">Or is this real?</font>

278
00:19:32,628 --> 00:19:35,298
<font color="#27ff24">What is wrong
with your American friend?</font>

279
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,595
<font color="#27ff24">He has lost his spirit to live.</font>

280
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,138
<font color="#27ff24">And he is not my friend.</font>

281
00:19:43,097 --> 00:19:45,474
<font color="#27ff24">Isn't that right, Cursed One?</font>

282
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,978
<font color="#27ff24">You have lost your spirit to live.</font>

283
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,271
<font color="#27ff24">Yeah. Yeah, something like that.</font>

284
00:19:52,857 --> 00:19:53,901
<font color="#27ff24">No…</font>

285
00:19:57,945 --> 00:19:59,906
<font color="#27ff24">He is American after all.</font>

286
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,660
<font color="#27ff24">Big talk, but weak inside.</font>

287
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:06,078
<font color="#27ff24">Tell him to eat.</font>

288
00:20:07,413 --> 00:20:09,415
<font color="#27ff24">Or he endangers us all.</font>

289
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,377
<font color="#27ff24">We have a big fight ahead of us.</font>

290
00:20:13,961 --> 00:20:15,130
<font color="#27ff24">What are you talking about? Fight?</font>

291
00:20:15,963 --> 00:20:19,134
<font color="#27ff24">I have been in this place one week.</font>

292
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,596
<font color="#27ff24">My first night,</font>

293
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,597
<font color="#27ff24">I saw six men enter this room.</font>

294
00:20:25,348 --> 00:20:26,432
<font color="#27ff24">Six.</font>

295
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,101
<font color="#27ff24">Just like us.</font>

296
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:29,728
<font color="#27ff24">They came out</font>

297
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:34,357
<font color="#27ff24">happy and fat, faces smothered in grease.</font>

298
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,987
<font color="#27ff24">But when night fell,
they were thrown into that pit out there.</font>

299
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:40,739
<font color="#27ff24">But not alone.</font>

300
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,825
<font color="#27ff24">You heard those roars, yes?</font>

301
00:20:46,953 --> 00:20:48,038
<font color="#27ff24">That is a monster.</font>

302
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,749
<font color="#27ff24">Not from this world.</font>

303
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:58,089
<font color="#27ff24">Thirty seconds it took! Thirty seconds...</font>

304
00:20:58,173 --> 00:20:59,883
<font color="#27ff24">And all six men…</font>

305
00:21:00,424 --> 00:21:01,884
<font color="#27ff24">You speak no sense.</font>

306
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,637
<font color="#27ff24">If they plan to kill us tonight,
why waste this food on us?</font>

307
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,390
<font color="#27ff24">They want us strong.</font>

308
00:21:06,472 --> 00:21:08,557
<font color="#27ff24">So we can fight it.</font>

309
00:21:09,433 --> 00:21:10,852
<font color="#27ff24">To test its strength.</font>

310
00:21:10,935 --> 00:21:13,105
<font color="#27ff24">To train this monster for war.</font>

311
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:16,566
<font color="#27ff24">But last week, the men got their weapons...</font>

312
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,611
<font color="#27ff24">then scattered like fools.</font>

313
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:21,904
<font color="#27ff24">We stick together...</font>

314
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:23,781
<font color="#27ff24">Perhaps we stand a chance!</font>

315
00:21:24,365 --> 00:21:26,410
<font color="#27ff24">Perhaps we live to see another day.</font>

316
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,872
<font color="#27ff24">Till tomorrow!</font>

317
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,458
<font color="#27ff24">Let me guess.</font>

318
00:21:34,917 --> 00:21:35,919
<font color="#27ff24">This…</font>

319
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,339
<font color="#27ff24">…it's about nine feet tall?</font>

320
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:42,425
<font color="#27ff24">Thin, white skin?</font>

321
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,135
<font color="#27ff24">No face?</font>

322
00:21:45,761 --> 00:21:46,846
<font color="#27ff24">No eyes?</font>

323
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:50,308
<font color="#27ff24">Come on, come on, come on. Translate!</font>

324
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,155
<font color="#27ff24">How do you know this?</font>

325
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,450
<font color="#27ff24">'Cause I've seen one.</font>

326
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:08,492
<font color="#27ff24">And I've fought one.</font>

327
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:11,371
<font color="#27ff24">And all your theories about it,</font>

328
00:22:12,955 --> 00:22:14,040
<font color="#27ff24">they're all wrong.</font>

329
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:19,211
<font color="#27ff24">You know why they feed
captive predators live prey?</font>

330
00:22:20,463 --> 00:22:24,675
<font color="#27ff24">Because if they don't, the predator
gets bored and it stops eating.</font>

331
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,471
<font color="#27ff24">It needs the thrill of the hunt.</font>

332
00:22:31,807 --> 00:22:37,021
<font color="#27ff24">We're not here to train this monster
with swords and axes.</font>

333
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:39,941
<font color="#27ff24">We're here to entertain it.</font>

334
00:22:41,817 --> 00:22:42,943
<font color="#27ff24">And this food…</font>

335
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,740
<font color="#27ff24">This food isn't to make us strong.</font>

336
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:51,161
<font color="#27ff24">It's to, uh, make us plump.</font>

337
00:22:53,913 --> 00:22:58,250
<font color="#27ff24">So we're full of the nutrients and protein
that a growing monster might need.</font>

338
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:04,924
<font color="#27ff24">So eat up, boys.</font>

339
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:06,634
<font color="#27ff24">Enjoy.</font>

340
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,512
<font color="#27ff24">This is your last meal.</font>

341
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,756
<font color="#27ff24">Which number are you aiming for?</font>

342
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,220
<font color="#27ff24">Three.</font>

343
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,059
<font color="#27ff24">You know,</font>

344
00:23:58,603 --> 00:23:59,688
<font color="#27ff24">sometimes</font>

345
00:24:01,105 --> 00:24:03,357
<font color="#27ff24">it's helpful to take a step away
for a moment.</font>

346
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:05,734
<font color="#27ff24">Let the mind clear.</font>

347
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:21,084
<font color="#27ff24">Determined, aren't we?</font>

348
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:23,336
<font color="#27ff24">You know…</font>

349
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:27,048
<font color="#27ff24">…you remind me of someone.
Someone I used to know really well.</font>

350
00:24:27,965 --> 00:24:29,509
<font color="#27ff24">Can you guess who that is?</font>

351
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:40,854
<font color="#27ff24">One?</font>

352
00:24:43,397 --> 00:24:45,608
<font color="#27ff24">- Papa said that he doesn't...
- Exist? I know.</font>

353
00:24:50,654 --> 00:24:52,615
<font color="#27ff24">But can I tell you a secret?</font>

354
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:53,950
<font color="#27ff24">Sometimes,</font>

355
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,744
<font color="#27ff24">Papa doesn't tell the truth.</font>

356
00:24:58,329 --> 00:25:00,123
<font color="#27ff24">I spent years with One.</font>

357
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:02,250
<font color="#27ff24">Right here.</font>

358
00:25:03,417 --> 00:25:04,794
<font color="#27ff24">In this very room.</font>

359
00:25:04,877 --> 00:25:05,921
<font color="#27ff24">Where is he?</font>

360
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,465
<font color="#27ff24">Maybe we'll save that story
for another day.</font>

361
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:13,094
<font color="#27ff24">It doesn't have a happy ending,
I'm afraid.</font>

362
00:25:14,011 --> 00:25:15,555
<font color="#27ff24">But he was a lot like you.</font>

363
00:25:15,638 --> 00:25:17,641
<font color="#27ff24">Everything was hard for him.</font>

364
00:25:17,723 --> 00:25:21,228
<font color="#27ff24">Then, out of nowhere,
he walked in here and it was like</font>

365
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:23,355
<font color="#27ff24">something had changed.</font>

366
00:25:24,772 --> 00:25:27,150
<font color="#27ff24">And I asked him what's different,
and he said…</font>

367
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:32,948
<font color="#27ff24">He said he had figured it out.</font>

368
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,576
<font color="#27ff24">He had found his strength
in a memory from his past.</font>

369
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,871
<font color="#27ff24">Something that made him sad.</font>

370
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,665
<font color="#27ff24">But also angry.</font>

371
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:44,917
<font color="#27ff24">Do you</font>

372
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,336
<font color="#27ff24">maybe have a memory like that?</font>

373
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:54,134
<font color="#27ff24">Do you remember the day
a strange woman came to see you?</font>

374
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:58,138
<font color="#27ff24">This would've been
when Eight was still here.</font>

375
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:02,769
<font color="#27ff24">The woman,</font>

376
00:26:04,395 --> 00:26:06,230
<font color="#27ff24">she was calling a name to you.</font>

377
00:26:06,855 --> 00:26:09,150
<font color="#27ff24">Jane. No! No!</font>

378
00:26:09,233 --> 00:26:10,777
<font color="#27ff24">No! Jane!</font>

379
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:12,653
<font color="#27ff24">That</font>

380
00:26:13,696 --> 00:26:14,948
<font color="#27ff24">was your mother.</font>

381
00:26:17,616 --> 00:26:18,951
<font color="#27ff24">Mama is dead.</font>

382
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:20,869
<font color="#27ff24">She died making me.</font>

383
00:26:20,953 --> 00:26:22,079
<font color="#27ff24">And who told you that?</font>

384
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:23,163
<font color="#27ff24">Papa.</font>

385
00:26:27,751 --> 00:26:29,837
<font color="#27ff24">Who doesn't always tell the truth.</font>

386
00:26:32,089 --> 00:26:33,424
<font color="#27ff24">This place…</font>

387
00:26:35,426 --> 00:26:36,760
<font color="#27ff24">And the people here…</font>

388
00:26:39,138 --> 00:26:40,848
<font color="#27ff24">Are not what you think.</font>

389
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:47,980
<font color="#27ff24">- Good morning, children.
- Good morning, Papa.</font>

390
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:52,027
<font color="#27ff24">I've got something very special
planned for you today.</font>

391
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:53,778
<font color="#27ff24">Are you ready?</font>

392
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,572
<font color="#27ff24">Yes, Papa.</font>

393
00:26:55,654 --> 00:26:56,865
<font color="#27ff24">Good.</font>

394
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,950
<font color="#27ff24">Seventeen, would you open the door?</font>

395
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,785
<font color="#27ff24">- Yes, Papa.
- Off you go.</font>

396
00:27:09,877 --> 00:27:10,795
<font color="#27ff24">After you.</font>

397
00:27:24,099 --> 00:27:26,310
<font color="#27ff24">We should've just told her the truth.</font>

398
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:27,686
<font color="#27ff24">And risk everything?</font>

399
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,480
<font color="#27ff24">No.</font>

400
00:27:30,481 --> 00:27:32,192
<font color="#27ff24">She'll find out soon enough.</font>

401
00:27:53,003 --> 00:27:55,382
<font color="#27ff24">Dude, I'm telling you,
you're taking us the wrong way.</font>

402
00:27:55,464 --> 00:27:57,717
<font color="#27ff24">It's north. I'm positive.
I checked the map.</font>

403
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,428
<font color="#27ff24">You do realize Skull Rock,
it's a super popular make-out spot?</font>

404
00:28:00,511 --> 00:28:01,429
<font color="#27ff24">Yeah. So?</font>

405
00:28:01,512 --> 00:28:04,307
<font color="#27ff24">Yeah, well, it wasn't popular
until I made it popular.</font>

406
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:06,101
<font color="#27ff24">All right? I practically invented it.</font>

407
00:28:06,183 --> 00:28:08,435
<font color="#27ff24">- We're heading in the wrong direction.
- Steve.</font>

408
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:12,523
<font color="#27ff24">- Where are you going? Steve!
- Stop whining. Let's go. Trust me.</font>

409
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:16,361
<font color="#27ff24">Okay, so apparently
we're going this way now?</font>

410
00:28:16,443 --> 00:28:18,613
<font color="#27ff24">I swear to God, if they get us lost…</font>

411
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:22,909
<font color="#27ff24">Hey.</font>

412
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:24,536
<font color="#27ff24">You okay?</font>

413
00:28:24,618 --> 00:28:25,662
<font color="#27ff24">Uh, yeah.</font>

414
00:28:27,579 --> 00:28:28,748
<font color="#27ff24">I'm fine. Just…</font>

415
00:28:29,665 --> 00:28:31,667
<font color="#27ff24">Thinking about Patrick. You know?</font>

416
00:28:32,376 --> 00:28:33,252
<font color="#27ff24">Yeah.</font>

417
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,922
<font color="#27ff24">I mean, it's… it's like,</font>

418
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:38,298
<font color="#27ff24">why him?</font>

419
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:41,845
<font color="#27ff24">But then, I remember this one day,</font>

420
00:28:41,927 --> 00:28:44,012
<font color="#27ff24">he… he came to practice with a black eye.</font>

421
00:28:44,513 --> 00:28:47,517
<font color="#27ff24">He said he fell, but clearly he was lying.</font>

422
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,646
<font color="#27ff24">It's like everyone Vecna targets</font>

423
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,732
<font color="#27ff24">has something in their life.</font>

424
00:28:56,483 --> 00:28:58,444
<font color="#27ff24">- Something that's...
- Hurting them.</font>

425
00:29:00,946 --> 00:29:01,865
<font color="#27ff24">Haunting them.</font>

426
00:29:03,031 --> 00:29:03,950
<font color="#27ff24">Yeah.</font>

427
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:07,453
<font color="#27ff24">I… I didn't really know Patrick,</font>

428
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:10,080
<font color="#27ff24">so it was easy to just</font>

429
00:29:10,789 --> 00:29:12,791
<font color="#27ff24">look the other way, I guess.</font>

430
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:16,336
<font color="#27ff24">But I did know you.</font>

431
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:21,384
<font color="#27ff24">And I'm sorry I wasn't there.</font>

432
00:29:21,925 --> 00:29:22,844
<font color="#27ff24">It's not your fault.</font>

433
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,012
<font color="#27ff24">- No.
- I disappeared.</font>

434
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,847
<font color="#27ff24">No, no, you didn't.</font>

435
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,476
<font color="#27ff24">I just didn't look hard enough.</font>

436
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:31,478
<font color="#27ff24">Okay?</font>

437
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,480
<font color="#27ff24">But I see you now.</font>

438
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:35,856
<font color="#27ff24">I see you.</font>

439
00:29:41,445 --> 00:29:45,157
<font color="#27ff24">Oh my God, they're so adorable.
I just wanna squeeze 'em, you know?</font>

440
00:29:45,741 --> 00:29:49,996
<font color="#27ff24">If I'm permitted to see a silver lining
in this end-of-the-world doom and gloom,</font>

441
00:29:50,078 --> 00:29:54,875
<font color="#27ff24">it would be the rekindling of old flames
that never should've been snuffed out.</font>

442
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:58,378
<font color="#27ff24">I didn't mean that as a hint or anything.</font>

443
00:29:58,462 --> 00:29:59,463
<font color="#27ff24">Right.</font>

444
00:30:00,339 --> 00:30:03,509
<font color="#27ff24">But if I did mean it as a hint,
would that be so terrible?</font>

445
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:05,470
<font color="#27ff24">To wish for happiness for my friends?</font>

446
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:07,596
<font color="#27ff24">You think I'm not happy?</font>

447
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,681
<font color="#27ff24">I… I'm sure you are.</font>

448
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,849
<font color="#27ff24">It's just, the other day,
I mentioned Jonathan</font>

449
00:30:10,933 --> 00:30:13,185
<font color="#27ff24">and you flinched
or winced or something like...</font>

450
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:15,395
<font color="#27ff24">I didn't flinch or wince.</font>

451
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,315
<font color="#27ff24">- Okay.
- Jonathan and I are fine.</font>

452
00:30:17,397 --> 00:30:18,357
<font color="#27ff24">- Got it.
- We're good.</font>

453
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:19,817
<font color="#27ff24">Right.</font>

454
00:30:20,943 --> 00:30:22,111
<font color="#27ff24">It's just…</font>

455
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,367
<font color="#27ff24">He was supposed to be here for the break,</font>

456
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:33,789
<font color="#27ff24">and then he backed out at the last minute
for some vague, mumbly Jonathan reason.</font>

457
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:36,084
<font color="#27ff24">And, to be honest, I'm not that surprised</font>

458
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:38,294
<font color="#27ff24">because I've been
feeling him pulling away.</font>

459
00:30:38,377 --> 00:30:41,130
<font color="#27ff24">And I don't know
if it's because we're 2,000 miles away</font>

460
00:30:41,213 --> 00:30:43,549
<font color="#27ff24">or if he met someone new or what.</font>

461
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:45,343
<font color="#27ff24">And now I can't find out why</font>

462
00:30:45,425 --> 00:30:48,637
<font color="#27ff24">because apparently he's blown up
his family's house phone or something.</font>

463
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:53,518
<font color="#27ff24">So, yeah, if… if the mention of his name
caused a slight muscle spasm on my face,</font>

464
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:56,311
<font color="#27ff24">that's… probably why.</font>

465
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:01,358
<font color="#27ff24">Seems like a perfectly reasonable reason
to flinch, wince, or something.</font>

466
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:07,824
<font color="#27ff24">You said, "the happiness of your friends."</font>

467
00:31:07,906 --> 00:31:10,660
<font color="#27ff24">So does that make us friends?</font>

468
00:31:10,742 --> 00:31:12,537
<font color="#27ff24">As in, officially?</font>

469
00:31:12,619 --> 00:31:15,455
<font color="#27ff24">Uh, yeah. I… I mean, right?</font>

470
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:17,208
<font color="#27ff24">Right.</font>

471
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:20,670
<font color="#27ff24">Oh, boom!</font>

472
00:31:20,752 --> 00:31:23,088
<font color="#27ff24">Bada bing, bada boom.
There she is, Henderson.</font>

473
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:24,382
<font color="#27ff24">Skull Rock.</font>

474
00:31:24,464 --> 00:31:27,343
<font color="#27ff24">In your face, man.
In your stupid, cocky little face.</font>

475
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:29,386
<font color="#27ff24">Doesn't make sense.</font>

476
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:32,097
<font color="#27ff24">Yeah, yeah. Even with it staring you
in the face, you can't admit it.</font>

477
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:34,182
<font color="#27ff24">Can't admit you're wrong, you butthead.</font>

478
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,184
<font color="#27ff24">I concur.</font>

479
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:38,479
<font color="#27ff24">You, Dustin Henderson, are a…</font>

480
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,148
<font color="#27ff24">Total butthead.</font>

481
00:31:41,231 --> 00:31:43,026
<font color="#27ff24">Jesus, we thought you were a goner.</font>

482
00:31:44,318 --> 00:31:45,528
<font color="#27ff24">Yeah, me too, man.</font>

483
00:31:46,445 --> 00:31:47,447
<font color="#27ff24">Me too.</font>

484
00:31:51,867 --> 00:31:54,578
<font color="#27ff24">How long have you known
Eddie was killing these kids?</font>

485
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:56,663
<font color="#27ff24">It was his trailer
where Chrissy was killed,</font>

486
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:59,834
<font color="#27ff24">and you expect us to believe
he was made a suspect just this morning?</font>

487
00:31:59,917 --> 00:32:03,128
<font color="#27ff24">The truth is we've been
following several leads,</font>

488
00:32:03,211 --> 00:32:05,757
<font color="#27ff24">and, yes, Eddie Munson was one of them.</font>

489
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:09,635
<font color="#27ff24">And we are now doing everything
in our power to find him.</font>

490
00:32:10,886 --> 00:32:13,347
<font color="#27ff24">In the meantime, for your safety,</font>

491
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,557
<font color="#27ff24">we will be enforcing a strict curfew.</font>

492
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:17,727
<font color="#27ff24">- What?
- That's your solution?</font>

493
00:32:17,809 --> 00:32:20,688
<font color="#27ff24">- Hide from him?
- We're already doing that.</font>

494
00:32:20,771 --> 00:32:22,522
<font color="#27ff24">It's been days. Days!</font>

495
00:32:22,606 --> 00:32:25,151
<font color="#27ff24">So you tell me why
he's not behind bars right now.</font>

496
00:32:25,233 --> 00:32:28,863
<font color="#27ff24">I understand you all are upset,
but I promise you,</font>

497
00:32:28,946 --> 00:32:30,530
<font color="#27ff24">we will find him.</font>

498
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,657
<font color="#27ff24">No.</font>

499
00:32:35,619 --> 00:32:36,453
<font color="#27ff24">You won't.</font>

500
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:37,955
<font color="#27ff24">Jason?</font>

501
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,916
<font color="#27ff24">Son, how about
we talk about this in private?</font>

502
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,670
<font color="#27ff24">Why? So you can keep me quiet?</font>

503
00:32:43,752 --> 00:32:46,130
<font color="#27ff24">So you can keep the truth from coming out?</font>

504
00:32:46,213 --> 00:32:47,965
<font color="#27ff24">I don't know about the rest of you,</font>

505
00:32:48,048 --> 00:32:50,801
<font color="#27ff24">but I can't bear to listen
to any more excuses and lies.</font>

506
00:32:50,884 --> 00:32:53,136
<font color="#27ff24">- That's enough.
- I agree, I've had enough!</font>

507
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,223
<font color="#27ff24">In fact, I think we've all had enough.</font>

508
00:33:07,109 --> 00:33:08,111
<font color="#27ff24">Last night…</font>

509
00:33:14,241 --> 00:33:16,743
<font color="#27ff24">Last night, I saw things,
things I can't explain.</font>

510
00:33:18,453 --> 00:33:22,290
<font color="#27ff24">Things the police don't wanna believe.</font>

511
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,045
<font color="#27ff24">And things that
I don't wanna believe myself.</font>

512
00:33:26,128 --> 00:33:28,172
<font color="#27ff24">But I know what I saw. I know.</font>

513
00:33:29,589 --> 00:33:31,968
<font color="#27ff24">And I've come to accept an awful truth.</font>

514
00:33:33,301 --> 00:33:36,681
<font color="#27ff24">These murders are ritualistic sacrifices.</font>

515
00:33:36,763 --> 00:33:40,143
<font color="#27ff24">We've all heard how satanic cults
are spreading through our country</font>

516
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:41,769
<font color="#27ff24">like some… some disease.</font>

517
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,186
<font color="#27ff24">And Eddie Munson</font>

518
00:33:44,021 --> 00:33:45,981
<font color="#27ff24">is the leader of one of these cults.</font>

519
00:33:46,481 --> 00:33:48,483
<font color="#27ff24">A cult that operates here in Hawkins.</font>

520
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,278
<font color="#27ff24">The mall fire.</font>

521
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,530
<font color="#27ff24">All those unexplained deaths
over the years.</font>

522
00:33:54,156 --> 00:33:57,326
<font color="#27ff24">Some people say our town is cursed.
They just don't know why.</font>

523
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,037
<font color="#27ff24">Now… Now we do.</font>

524
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:00,579
<font color="#27ff24">Now we know.</font>

525
00:34:04,666 --> 00:34:05,876
<font color="#27ff24">They call themselves Hellfire.</font>

526
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,461
<font color="#27ff24">That's bullshit!</font>

527
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:10,840
<font color="#27ff24">The Hellfire isn't a cult.
It's a club for nerds.</font>

528
00:34:10,922 --> 00:34:12,884
<font color="#27ff24">- Erica!
- Just the facts.</font>

529
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:13,800
<font color="#27ff24">A club.</font>

530

<font color="#27ff24">Cursed? No, no. He's fine.</font>

658
00:40:40,311 --> 00:40:42,981
<font color="#27ff24">Mental? Absolutely.</font>

659
00:40:43,606 --> 00:40:44,817
<font color="#27ff24">Boom!</font>

660
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:49,612
<font color="#27ff24">Bada… bada… boom.</font>

661
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:51,990
<font color="#27ff24">I was right.</font>

662
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:54,492
<font color="#27ff24">Skull Rock was north.</font>

663
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:56,704
<font color="#27ff24">- Seriously? You're serious?
- Mm-hmm.</font>

664
00:40:56,786 --> 00:40:58,456
<font color="#27ff24">- This is Skull Rock. Okay?
- Mm-hmm.</font>

665
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:01,876
<font color="#27ff24">You're totally, absolutely,
100% wrong. Right now.</font>

666
00:41:01,958 --> 00:41:02,918
<font color="#27ff24">Yes.</font>

667
00:41:03,793 --> 00:41:05,253
<font color="#27ff24">And no.</font>

668
00:41:05,336 --> 00:41:06,422
<font color="#27ff24">Oh my God.</font>

669
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:09,257
<font color="#27ff24">This worked correctly
when we left the Wheelers'.</font>

670
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,469
<font color="#27ff24">Correct when we got in the car on Curly.</font>

671
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,512
<font color="#27ff24">But it started to slip
the further east we went.</font>

672
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:16,097
<font color="#27ff24">Now it's way off.</font>

673
00:41:16,181 --> 00:41:18,684
<font color="#27ff24">When I was leading us here,
I wasn't wrong.</font>

674
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:20,728
<font color="#27ff24">The compass was.</font>

675
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:22,896
<font color="#27ff24">So you're using faulty equipment.
You're still wrong.</font>

676
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,898
<font color="#27ff24">Except it isn't faulty.</font>

677
00:41:24,981 --> 00:41:27,233
<font color="#27ff24">Lucas, remember what can affect a compass?</font>

678
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,777
<font color="#27ff24">- An electromagnetic field.
- Yep.</font>

679
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,780
<font color="#27ff24">Sorry. I must've skipped that class.</font>

680
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:34,699
<font color="#27ff24">In the presence
of a stronger electromagnetic field,</font>

681
00:41:34,782 --> 00:41:37,577
<font color="#27ff24">the needle will deflect
towards that power.</font>

682
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:41,164
<font color="#27ff24">So either there's some
super big magnet around here, or…</font>

683
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:42,081
<font color="#27ff24">There's a gate.</font>

684
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:44,751
<font color="#27ff24">But we're nowhere near the lab.</font>

685
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:48,255
<font color="#27ff24">But what if, somehow,
there's another gate?</font>

686
00:41:48,338 --> 00:41:50,007
<font color="#27ff24">A gate that we don't know about.</font>

687
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,300
<font color="#27ff24">It'd have to be smaller.
Way less powerful.</font>

688
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:54,010
<font color="#27ff24">- Snack-size gate.
- How? Why?</font>

689
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:58,056
<font color="#27ff24">No idea. All I know is that something
is causing this disturbance,</font>

690
00:41:58,139 --> 00:42:00,893
<font color="#27ff24">and the last time we've seen
anything like it, it was a gate.</font>

691
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:03,771
<font color="#27ff24">And I hope it is
because then we'd have a way to Vecna.</font>

692
00:42:03,853 --> 00:42:06,148
<font color="#27ff24">And a shot at freeing Max from this curse.</font>

693
00:42:07,065 --> 00:42:09,818
<font color="#27ff24">Where are you going?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.</font>

694
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:13,239
<font color="#27ff24">Eddie's still a wanted man.
We can't just go hike in the woods.</font>

695
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:18,827
<font color="#27ff24">This little steel capsule might be the key
to saving both Max and Eddie.</font>

696
00:42:20,161 --> 00:42:22,164
<font color="#27ff24">What say you, Eddie the Banished?</font>

697
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:28,628
<font color="#27ff24">I say you're asking me
to follow you into Mordor,</font>

698
00:42:28,711 --> 00:42:31,673
<font color="#27ff24">which, if I'm totally straight with you,</font>

699
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:33,759
<font color="#27ff24">I think is a really bad idea.</font>

700
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:36,177
<font color="#27ff24">But, uh, the Shire…</font>

701
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:39,014
<font color="#27ff24">The Shire is burning.</font>

702
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:45,813
<font color="#27ff24">So Mordor it is.</font>

703
00:42:51,985 --> 00:42:53,528
<font color="#27ff24">What is Mordor?</font>

704
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:56,990
<font color="#27ff24">Get your stuff, dude. Let's go.</font>

705
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:01,829

706

707
00:43:06,291 --> 00:43:08,626

00:48:04,338 --> 00:48:06,257
<font color="#27ff24">Oh.</font>

753
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:13,639

- Hey. Not in a church.</font>

756

<font color="#27ff24">You like all this?
Wait until you see my flamethrower.</font>

757
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:32,034
<font color="#27ff24">We don't have time for show-and-tell.
We need to get going.</font>

758
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:34,036
<font color="#27ff24">She's always this bossy?</font>

759

760
00:48:37,246 --> 00:48:38,916

762
00:48:43,586 --> 00:48:46,172
<font color="#27ff24">So, prison is here.</font>

763
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:49,009
<font color="#27ff24">Between these two mountains.</font>

764
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:50,927
<font color="#27ff24">Approximately two-hour drive.</font>

765
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:52,094
<font color="#27ff24">I don't see anything.</font>

766
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:55,264

but it is there.</font>

767
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:57,934
<font color="#27ff24">How do we know
you're not leading us into some trap?</font>

768
00:48:58,018 --> 00:48:59,978
<font color="#27ff24">Because I do not need to.</font>

769
00:49:00,061 --> 00:49:05,108
<font color="#27ff24">You want to break into
deadliest prison in all motherland.</font>

770
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:07,360
<font color="#27ff24">It is suicide.</font>

771
00:49:07,443 --> 00:49:09,780
<font color="#27ff24">Who said anything about breaking in?</font>

772
00:49:09,862 --> 00:49:12,407
<font color="#27ff24">Oh. You just expect to knock?</font>

773
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:16,036
<font color="#27ff24">"Oh hello, let me in.
I'm friendly American with a big beard."</font>

774
00:49:18,454 --> 00:49:21,083
<font color="#27ff24">Something like that, actually, yes.</font>

775
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:23,418
<font color="#27ff24">You were planning
to turn us over to the warden.</font>

776
00:49:23,501 --> 00:49:25,963
<font color="#27ff24">Today, if I'm not mistaken.</font>

777
00:49:26,045 --> 00:49:29,090
<font color="#27ff24">Ah, I see now.</font>

778
00:49:29,173 --> 00:49:30,967
<font color="#27ff24">I bring you in as prisoners</font>

779
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:33,052
<font color="#27ff24">and then set you free inside walls.</font>

780
00:49:33,135 --> 00:49:35,681
<font color="#27ff24">It is risky, crazy,</font>

781
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:37,891
<font color="#27ff24">you will still probably die,</font>

782
00:49:37,974 --> 00:49:39,393
<font color="#27ff24">yet I like it.</font>

783
00:49:40,476 --> 00:49:42,853
<font color="#27ff24">But for this to work, Yuri cannot be tied.</font>

784
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:45,231
<font color="#27ff24">Hey, it's hard to turn over prisoners</font>

785
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:46,983
<font color="#27ff24">when I'm a prisoner myself.</font>

786
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:50,612
<font color="#27ff24">Hey, I think the warden
might find that suspicious.</font>

787
00:49:50,695 --> 00:49:53,197
<font color="#27ff24">Which is why, from here on out,</font>

788
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,449
<font color="#27ff24">you're gonna be Murray.</font>
