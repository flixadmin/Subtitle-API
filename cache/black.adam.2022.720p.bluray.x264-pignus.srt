1
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,256
Eternium.

2
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:18,045
Eternium.

3
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:19,056
Eternium.

4
00:02:19,338 --> 00:02:20,547
Eternium.

5
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:33,820
Get off him!

6
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,030
Get off him!

7
00:02:35,468 --> 00:02:36,907
Get off him!

8
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:43,038
Why are we fighting each other?

9
00:02:43,517 --> 00:02:44,873
Remember who our real enemy is!

10
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:46,291
Come with me.

11
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,671
Look! Eternium.

12
00:02:52,151 --> 00:02:53,048
Let me see that.

13
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,430
The King thanks you.

14
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,889
He's supposed to reward him.

15
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:03,725
Is that right?

16
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:05,560
I want what I'm owed.

17
00:03:11,427 --> 00:03:12,974
You want a reward?

18
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,531
The King thanks you for your service.

19
00:03:26,227 --> 00:03:28,500
You want the King's reward too?

20
00:03:30,298 --> 00:03:33,468
No, but my son accepts the King's mercy.

21
00:03:39,289 --> 00:03:41,888
I won't always be here to protect you.

22
00:03:42,441 --> 00:03:45,225
I don't need protection.
I want to be free.

23
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,961
If we fight together,
we could overthrow the King.

24
00:03:47,963 --> 00:03:49,646
Let someone else be the hero...

25
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:51,898
...the graveyards are full of them.

26
00:03:51,963 --> 00:03:55,007
Stop dreaming and go back to work.

27
00:04:08,436 --> 00:04:10,586
If we had more heroes...

28
00:04:11,192 --> 00:04:14,050
...then maybe our freedom
wouldn't be a dream.

29
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,342
Freedom! Freedom!

30
00:05:13,111 --> 00:05:14,689
You have been chosen.

31
00:05:16,429 --> 00:05:17,575
The stamina of Shu!

32
00:05:17,577 --> 00:05:18,620
The swiftness of Heru!

33
00:05:18,622 --> 00:05:19,801
The strength of Amon!

34
00:05:19,803 --> 00:05:21,899
The wisdom of Zehuti!

35
00:05:21,901 --> 00:05:22,779
The power of Aten!

36
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:24,032
The courage of Mehen!

37
00:05:24,805 --> 00:05:25,994
S-H-A-Z-A-M!

38
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,371
Hurry.

39
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:30,288
Give it to me!

40
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:32,833
Give it to me!

41
00:18:00,225 --> 00:18:01,622
Your magic is weak.

42
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,437
Forgive me.

43
00:54:08,829 --> 00:54:09,621
Hurry.

44
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:11,165
Give it to me!

45
00:54:36,489 --> 00:54:40,444
Don't kill me.
I can give you anything you want.

46
00:54:42,217 --> 00:54:44,114
This is what I want.

47
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:01,546
We have chosen recklessly...

48
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:03,425
...and humanity has paid the price.

49
00:55:03,966 --> 00:55:05,509
And now, Teth Adam...

50
00:55:05,511 --> 00:55:07,226
...you must pay.

51
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:37,213
Death is the only path to life.

52
01:21:32,700 --> 01:21:34,973
I won't always be here to protect you.

53
01:21:35,578 --> 01:21:38,310
I don't need protection.
I want to be free.

54
01:21:39,957 --> 01:21:41,313
Freedom is for the birds.

55
01:21:41,522 --> 01:21:43,440
Let someone else be the hero...

56
01:21:44,443 --> 01:21:46,777
...the graveyards are full of them.

57
01:22:41,251 --> 01:22:42,503
Hold on, Father.

58
01:22:44,012 --> 01:22:45,055
Stay with me.

59
01:22:52,614 --> 01:22:53,677
With my powers...

60
01:22:54,845 --> 01:22:56,180
...you'll be safe.

61
01:22:57,306 --> 01:22:59,016
I couldn't protect your mother.

62
01:23:00,259 --> 01:23:02,686
Repeat what I say.

63
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:33,867
Some men are not meant... to be heroes.

64
01:32:50,586 --> 01:32:52,776
The King has returned!

65
01:32:53,777 --> 01:32:55,904
The throne will be mine!

66
01:43:52,534 --> 01:43:55,433
The Gods have brought us together again.

67
01:43:57,481 --> 01:44:00,234
It's not your time, Father.

68
01:44:24,425 --> 01:44:26,177
The people need a hero.

69
01:44:27,929 --> 01:44:28,971
No, Father.

70
01:44:30,137 --> 01:44:32,224
They need to be free.

71
01:45:00,611 --> 01:45:02,755
Say the word.
