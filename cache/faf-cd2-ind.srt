1
00:00:09,191 --> 00:00:10,497
yeah, corona

2
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,898
its too bad about Dwight, having the Feds infiltrate your house the
same night before we make the team

3
00:00:18,322 --> 00:00:19,154
it’s a little unfortunate

4
00:00:20,435 --> 00:00:22,897
I wish I could say I was a surprise to see you here

5
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:27,651
whats to stop selling and telling people you’re a cop

6
00:00:27,651 --> 00:00:31,034
probably the same thing that is
keeping me from telling why you're really here

7
00:00:31,043 --> 00:00:33,487
-what up fellas
-hey, how you doing?

8
00:00:33,487 --> 00:00:36,289
Having a good time, - yep a good time

9
00:00:36,289 --> 00:00:38,268
yeah, great time

10
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,333
hows your car?
it took a nasty bump

11
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:43,881
it would be ready

12
00:00:43,881 --> 00:00:47,033
I also heard that you just got out of county

13
00:00:47,033 --> 00:00:48,626
yeah

14
00:00:49,844 --> 00:00:51,186
you know a guy called Jim Garcia

15
00:00:51,186 --> 00:00:55,278
no, big place, there’s lots of names lots of faces

16
00:00:56,907 --> 00:00:59,539
and you ? you want to buy a lot
of people homes

17
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:01,688
well that kind of heat isn’t good for business

18
00:01:01,688 --> 00:01:04,365
yeah, well that depend on how you look at things

19
00:01:04,365 --> 00:01:07,453
I go down, I do time

20
00:01:09,226 --> 00:01:10,094
I do REAL time

21
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:12,332
I don’t know about the other drivers

22
00:01:12,332 --> 00:01:14,937
but when I see flashing lights in my mirror

23
00:01:14,937 --> 00:01:16,826
I don’t stop

24
00:01:22,036 --> 00:01:23,505
Do you know each other?

25
00:01:27,892 --> 00:01:30,166
He used to date my sister

26
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:31,992
I see

27
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:36,970
-you're lucky man
- how's that ?

28
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:40,013
- you're still breathing

29
00:01:45,985 --> 00:01:49,798
to the ladies we loved and the ladies we lost

30
00:01:49,798 --> 00:01:51,625
salute

31
00:01:58,295 --> 00:01:59,977
so, what's Braga "about"?

32
00:02:01,831 --> 00:02:03,550
You know, he just one of us

33
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:06,593
you know, he's just one of us
came out from the streets down for albarrio

34
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:09,234
Now, he's shot caller

35
00:02:09,234 --> 00:02:11,957
Boss of bosses

36
00:02:11,957 --> 00:02:14,149
see all these cats in here?

37
00:02:14,158 --> 00:02:17,578
Anyone of them will die for Braga

38
00:02:17,578 --> 00:02:19,011
including you?

39
00:02:21,455 --> 00:02:22,959
Especially me

40
00:02:32,332 --> 00:02:33,863
enjoy the party fellows

41
00:02:33,863 --> 00:02:36,343
the clubs is yours, what ever you want,
booze, broads, its all there

42
00:02:40,488 --> 00:02:41,705
Braga's mine

43
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:47,193
I’m taking the whole house down

44
00:02:47,193 --> 00:02:49,798
Good luck

45
00:04:52,617 --> 00:04:54,704
something interest you about this car?

46
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,990
Just admiring the body work

47
00:04:59,269 --> 00:05:03,415
are you one of those boys who prefer cars to women?

48
00:05:06,387 --> 00:05:09,108
I'm one of those boys who'd appreciates

49
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:10,863
the fine body regardless to the "mink!"

50
00:05:14,632 --> 00:05:16,019
Is it your car?

51
00:05:19,905 --> 00:05:21,687
It's Phoenix's car

52
00:05:21,687 --> 00:05:24,417
you'll meet him at the rendevous

53
00:05:24,417 --> 00:05:26,575
He will be leading you

54
00:05:28,043 --> 00:05:29,126
so now

55
00:05:30,505 --> 00:05:32,653
that I know your taste in cars

56
00:05:32,653 --> 00:05:35,697
tell me, what about your women

57
00:05:37,693 --> 00:05:39,547
well starts with the eyes

58
00:05:41,785 --> 00:05:45,850
she got have those kind of eyes that
can look right through the bull shit

59
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:48,643
to the good in someone

60
00:05:53,396 --> 00:05:56,583
20% angel, 80% devil

61
00:05:57,944 --> 00:05:59,726
down to earth

62
00:06:01,409 --> 00:06:05,241
ain't afraid to get a little
engine grease under her fingers nails

63
00:06:12,313 --> 00:06:14,292
that doesn’t sound anything like me

64
00:06:17,174 --> 00:06:18,786
it ain't

65
00:06:27,165 --> 00:06:28,473
-hey
- I got a gift for you
-Alright

66
00:06:30,235 --> 00:06:32,752
a dirty shot glass, just what I always wanted

67
00:06:32,752 --> 00:06:34,121
I got these from the club last night

68
00:06:34,121 --> 00:06:36,154
there’s two set of prints
here run it both

69
00:06:36,154 --> 00:06:39,340
I know that one of these is
Campos and I think that the other might be Braga's

70
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,507
and you have to go beyond the interpol

71
00:06:41,507 --> 00:06:45,491
so that means I have to contact
individual agencies that could take weeks

72
00:06:46,717 --> 00:06:47,568
ok

73
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:54,157
DOWNLOADING DATA COORDINATES

74
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,510
Yeah

75
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:05,491
that’s your third traffic violation in less than three blocks

76
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:07,075
slow it down, O'Conner

77
00:07:08,464 --> 00:07:09,600
sure thing dad

78
00:07:16,082 --> 00:07:17,281
( tracking system transmitting)

79
00:07:37,863 --> 00:07:39,027
He stopped

80
00:08:31,175 --> 00:08:32,366
we lost him

81
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,291
-he killed the tracker
- We don’t know that

82
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:36,377
-l’m telling you he killed the tracker
-We don’t know that yet

83
00:08:36,377 --> 00:08:37,925
get the bird overhead

84
00:08:39,823 --> 00:08:42,285
I’m heading to the north
33 56

85
00:08:46,556 --> 00:08:47,549
All clear

86
00:09:09,662 --> 00:09:11,740
[base : black night, I'm angel 5]

87
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,950
I don’t have a tally on the target, repeat

88
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:16,887
-l don’t have a tally on the target
-there’s no one down there

89
00:09:16,887 --> 00:09:18,256
-damn it

90
00:09:25,517 --> 00:09:27,692
( dialling numbers )

91
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,449
They said nothing about being locked in the trunk

92
00:09:33,449 --> 00:09:34,568
tell me about it

93
00:09:41,157 --> 00:09:43,127
-where do you think that they're taking us?

94
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,750
Don’t matter

95
00:09:48,758 --> 00:09:51,524
we're all just along for the ride now

96
00:10:02,178 --> 00:10:04,112
Welcome to Mexico, boys

97
00:10:09,501 --> 00:10:13,789
there're helicopters and surveillance cameras
that scans for heat signature of the border

98
00:10:13,789 --> 00:10:17,844
but there are blind spots that I
can guide you through the satellite

99
00:10:17,844 --> 00:10:19,644
there can be no margin of error

100
00:10:19,644 --> 00:10:22,204
so you must follow my every direction

101
00:10:23,252 --> 00:10:24,469
Any questions?

102
00:10:26,591 --> 00:10:28,588
I thought that Phoenix is gonna be here

103
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,323
He will meet you out there

104
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:40,638
Alright everybody, sync up

105
00:10:43,538 --> 00:10:45,194
Good luck gentlemen

106
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,730
( Speaking Spanish)

107
00:10:58,346 --> 00:11:00,458
Satellite link up engaged

108
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:03,762
keep proceeding north bound at current speed

109
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:09,670
stay close to Phoeniix

110
00:11:10,781 --> 00:11:12,302
he'll lead you across

111
00:11:12,302 --> 00:11:14,496
( satellite blinking )

112
00:11:25,776 --> 00:11:28,336
I got a heat signature north bound along Regarda Ravine....

113
00:11:31,031 --> 00:11:35,203
thermal imageing window on the Mexico side
is gonna be down for about 45 seconds?

114
00:11:35,203 --> 00:11:36,770
Get the camera on it

115
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,704
manual over-ride

116
00:11:38,704 --> 00:11:41,148
re-routing camera to designated coordinate

117
00:11:44,648 --> 00:11:46,466
Hurry up, you guys been tagged

118
00:11:56,778 --> 00:11:57,988
SHIT..

119
00:11:59,106 --> 00:12:01,031
Toretto, we got bad information

120
00:12:04,352 --> 00:12:05,901
reimaging commensing

121
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:15,248
I don't see anything

122
00:12:15,248 --> 00:12:16,681
they're gone

123
00:12:18,927 --> 00:12:20,771
get the helicopters to cover it

124
00:12:24,934 --> 00:12:27,504
34.7 sec from regardo ravine

125
00:12:28,668 --> 00:12:30,064
they're sending a helicopter

126
00:12:31,873 --> 00:12:33,431
you have 30 seconds

127
00:12:41,971 --> 00:12:44,782
its on 32.33 +01.64

128
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:52,786
The window's closing fast, you need..

129
00:12:52,786 --> 00:12:56,017
you need to get out of there
before they send the ground to floor

130
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:03,439
15 seconds

131
00:13:08,945 --> 00:13:11,255
target is at 2 miles

132
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:25,659
your running out of time

133
00:13:28,801 --> 00:13:30,440
you need to get out, NOW

134
00:13:42,266 --> 00:13:46,160
there is 116 to 49

135
00:13:46,169 --> 00:13:49,402
There’s no visual contact,
there’s no-one round here to serve confirmation

136
00:14:09,956 --> 00:14:11,102
sloppy

137
00:14:12,158 --> 00:14:13,394

138
00:14:18,756 --> 00:14:20,207

00:14:23,054 --> 00:14:24,128

156
00:15:24,405 --> 00:15:26,509
Somebody wrecked the car

157
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,569
I wrecked the car

158
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,299

159
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:49,373

00:17:20,725 --> 00:17:22,220
what have you got Trin?

168
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,503
We're contacting agencies in multiple countries

169
00:17:24,503 --> 00:17:28,755
unfortunately most of them have to
manually scan their prints for us to upload

170
00:17:30,457 --> 00:17:32,068
O'Conner is on line 5

171
00:17:32,068 --> 00:17:34,118
Sir you should see this

172
00:17:34,127 --> 00:17:35,712
thank you

173
00:17:45,935 --> 00:17:47,269
talk to me, O'Conner

174
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:49,418
-where the hell have
you been?

175
00:17:49,418 --> 00:17:53,285
- I got the shipment?
or we got the shipment?

176
00:17:52,653 --> 00:17:54,335
What are you talking about?

177
00:17:55,335 --> 00:17:57,189
Traffic cams in the area picked up

178
00:17:57,189 --> 00:17:59,391
pictures of you and Toretto together

179
00:18:00,021 --> 00:18:01,712
listen to me O'Conner

180
00:18:02,712 --> 00:18:05,515
bring in the shipment and bring in Toretto

181
00:18:05,515 --> 00:18:08,066
I thought the point was to get La Braga
we got the opportunity here

182
00:18:08,066 --> 00:18:10,653
Brain, the clock stopped ticking

183
00:18:10,969 --> 00:18:13,216
bring them in, are we clear?

184
00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:18,776
Conner?

185
00:18:28,221 --> 00:18:31,041
So this's what sixty million dollars looks like

186
00:18:32,589 --> 00:18:34,317
hey, you need a doctor

187
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:36,958
we have to find a place to hide this

188
00:18:40,155 --> 00:18:41,587
I got a spot

189
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:51,575
( breaks squeaking)

190
00:18:51,575 --> 00:18:54,914
5021 wreckless I need a 48 hour hope

191
00:18:55,857 --> 00:18:58,158
out back, any spot you can find

192
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:03,879
are you sure about this?

193
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:07,862
Yeah, the last place they'll check

194
00:19:07,862 --> 00:19:11,086
their own impound yard
trust me

195
00:19:17,405 --> 00:19:21,157
you know, I'm thinking when you blew up
your car back there, you blew up mine too?

196
00:19:21,157 --> 00:19:22,456
Yeah

197
00:19:23,467 --> 00:19:24,290
yeah

198
00:19:24,326 --> 00:19:26,063
now you owe me a 10 second car

199
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:29,232
is that right?

200
00:19:29,232 --> 00:19:30,208
Yeah

201
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:42,553
now we're even?

202
00:19:57,513 --> 00:19:59,787
-is this you're way of keeping me
away from him?

203
00:19:59,787 --> 00:20:03,028
-Your answering his calls
-he's my brother of course

204
00:20:11,246 --> 00:20:12,858
bullet's not in there

205
00:20:20,897 --> 00:20:24,003
-I'm gonna clean it, and stitch it up
it's gonna hurt

206
00:20:24,003 --> 00:20:26,143
I bet you're gonna enjoy this

207
00:20:27,531 --> 00:20:28,265
a little

208
00:20:32,927 --> 00:20:34,896
Do you want this?
yeah

209
00:20:34,896 --> 00:20:37,188
Spicy

210
00:20:39,184 --> 00:20:40,429
Hmmm

211
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:41,658
Dom, what are you doing?

212
00:20:42,714 --> 00:20:45,221
- you eat first! you should say grace

213
00:20:55,266 --> 00:20:57,298
thank you lord

214
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:59,598
for blessing this table

215
00:21:01,112 --> 00:21:03,430
with food and family

216
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,194
and friendship

217
00:21:37,414 --> 00:21:39,491
You asked me why I let Dom go?

218
00:21:41,568 --> 00:21:43,913
I think because at that moment

219
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:48,005
I respected him more than I did myself

220
00:21:55,444 --> 00:21:57,128
one think that I learnt from Dom is that

221
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:00,798
nothing really matters unless you have a code

222
00:22:03,421 --> 00:22:05,453
And what’s your code, Brian?

223
00:22:07,834 --> 00:22:09,670
I’m working on it

224
00:22:17,268 --> 00:22:19,148
(Evidence envelope)

225
00:22:30,025 --> 00:22:31,512
( Mobile dialling)

226
00:22:37,465 --> 00:22:38,996
( Mobile ringing)

227
00:22:42,937 --> 00:22:44,594
Oh, Shit

228
00:22:44,594 --> 00:22:46,223
Hey Dom,
- when you were gonna tell me?

229
00:22:46,223 --> 00:22:49,035
-Dom what you doing
- when you were gonna tell me
that you were running Letty?

230
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:50,690
- let me explain this - when would you tell me!?

231
00:22:56,716 --> 00:22:57,897
Stop, Stop

232
00:22:57,897 --> 00:23:00,010
- You don’t understand
- I don’t want to understand

233
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:01,129
Stop!

234
00:23:10,869 --> 00:23:12,741
Stop, Stop it, please Stop!

235
00:23:22,168 --> 00:23:23,653
She did it for you Dom

236
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,426
She did it for you

237
00:23:29,858 --> 00:23:32,722
Letty came to me to clear your name
in exchange for bringing down La Braga

238
00:23:36,885 --> 00:23:39,088
she just wanted you to come home

239
00:23:55,838 --> 00:23:58,882
I’m sorry Dom, I'm sorry

240
00:24:23,573 --> 00:24:26,295
you better have one hell of an explanation

241
00:24:26,295 --> 00:24:28,542
you disobeyed the direct order

242
00:24:28,542 --> 00:24:31,254
-where’s the shipment?
-its safe

243
00:24:31,254 --> 00:24:32,901
it’s safe

244
00:24:32,901 --> 00:24:35,784
look, we could use the shipment to parade in front of the media

245
00:24:35,784 --> 00:24:37,565
that you get a few hudred pounds of heroins off the streets

246
00:24:37,574 --> 00:24:39,597
but La Braga's gonna send another shipment
next week

247
00:24:39,597 --> 00:24:40,976
and the week after that

248
00:24:40,976 --> 00:24:45,238
let's use the shipment to lure La Braga out
and lop the head off of a multi-billion dollar Cartel

249
00:24:45,238 --> 00:24:47,575
and how do you suggest we do that?

250
00:24:47,575 --> 00:24:49,391
A hand to hand exchange with La Braga

251
00:24:49,391 --> 00:24:50,824
he'll never show up

252
00:24:50,842 --> 00:24:52,669
he can't afford not to

253
00:25:02,239 --> 00:25:03,295
You got a plan?

254
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:05,998
There’s a price

255
00:25:09,284 --> 00:25:11,791
we bag La Braga, you let Toretto walk

256
00:25:21,385 --> 00:25:23,131
- Yes
-hey star

257
00:25:23,913 --> 00:25:25,319
I was just thinking about you

258
00:25:26,527 --> 00:25:28,944
you know when I gave you my number
l was hoping that you'll call

259
00:25:31,368 --> 00:25:33,892
but not under these circumstances

260
00:25:33,892 --> 00:25:35,512
what circumstances?

261
00:25:35,512 --> 00:25:37,705
Me, being alive!

262
00:25:37,705 --> 00:25:39,899
Don’t take it personally

263
00:25:39,899 --> 00:25:42,146
... it’s just business

264
00:25:42,146 --> 00:25:44,438
I got some business of my own

265
00:25:44,438 --> 00:25:46,533
get Campos

266
00:25:49,075 --> 00:25:50,302
is for you

267
00:25:55,709 --> 00:25:58,055
was that how La Braga inspires loyalty

268
00:25:58,055 --> 00:26:00,016
killing his drivers?

269
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:02,361
One can always find more drivers

270
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:04,106
its just good for business

271
00:26:04,106 --> 00:26:05,977
I want to trade

272
00:26:05,977 --> 00:26:07,652
La Braga does not negotiate

273
00:26:07,652 --> 00:26:09,353
Fine

274
00:26:09,353 --> 00:26:13,794
fine how can you explain to him how
all of the sudden 60 million dollar
worth of product disappeared

275
00:26:13,794 --> 00:26:16,784
I know that can't be good for business

276
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:18,923
what do you want?

277
00:26:18,923 --> 00:26:23,919
6 million cash, delivered by Braga himself

278
00:26:26,202 --> 00:26:28,010
I don’t like being shot at

279
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:31,090
I ain't gonna put my neck out again
unless he has got something to loose to

280
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,934
he'll never go for it

281
00:26:32,934 --> 00:26:36,944
either I deal with Braga or you do

282
00:26:40,445 --> 00:26:41,948
when and where?

283
00:26:56,443 --> 00:27:00,015
Sir, clear's are on site
holding positions at a perimeter

284
00:27:00,024 --> 00:27:02,790
alright, listen up every body stay frosty

285
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:05,583
we don't move a muscle until conner gives the signal

286
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:07,472
when we get some money you know what to do

287
00:27:08,995 --> 00:27:10,821
well, the good news is that when we get this guy

288
00:27:10,821 --> 00:27:12,817
you walk out here a free man

289
00:27:12,817 --> 00:27:16,327
-is that what they told you?
- yeah that’s the deal

290
00:27:16,327 --> 00:27:20,239
you still put milk and cookies out for Santa Claus?

291
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:22,092
Yeah

292
00:27:27,186 --> 00:27:30,060
here, incase things go shitty

293
00:27:35,181 --> 00:27:37,839
-Just like old times
-Yeah

294
00:27:41,985 --> 00:27:43,130
oy, you dropped something

295
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:45,180
-That’s what you wanted right?
- Hold on

296
00:27:59,791 --> 00:28:01,760
he's harmless don’t worry about him

297
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:06,308
and he's really sorry about, Letty

298
00:28:08,833 --> 00:28:09,638
where’s our stuff?

299
00:28:12,611 --> 00:28:15,172
You mean the stuff that used to be in here right?

300
00:28:17,106 --> 00:28:20,534
-well, you'll see it when we see Braga
that was the deal

301
00:28:21,985 --> 00:28:22,835
No worries

302
00:28:22,835 --> 00:28:25,064
Braga keeps his word

303
00:28:59,325 --> 00:29:00,784
( Fingermatch identical)

304
00:29:07,436 --> 00:29:08,832
2 million

305
00:29:10,292 --> 00:29:11,886
you get the rest when I get my property

306
00:29:16,666 --> 00:29:18,385
- it's Stasiak
- we got a match

307
00:29:18,385 --> 00:29:20,220
fingerprint's La Braga
is a hundred percent

308
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,396
just waiting a facial confirmation via fax

309
00:29:22,396 --> 00:29:24,535
I got a question for you

310
00:29:24,535 --> 00:29:28,000
I got a question for you, you were in peak
when your clawing your way out of la barrio

311
00:29:30,005 --> 00:29:31,196
tell all the agents to move in

312
00:29:31,196 --> 00:29:33,980
we got a confirmation
primary suspect is wearing gray suit

313
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,368
let's move

314
00:29:35,368 --> 00:29:37,095
- sir, O'Conner hasn't given us the signal yet

315
00:29:37,095 --> 00:29:39,933
- what part of that didn't you understand,
we just get confirmation, do it

316
00:29:39,933 --> 00:29:42,987
secure primary suspect in gray suit, repeat

317
00:29:42,987 --> 00:29:45,941
secure primary suspect wearing a grey suite

318
00:29:59,227 --> 00:30:01,195
your thinking what I’m thinking, right?

319
00:30:04,401 --> 00:30:06,067
He ain’t Braga

320
00:30:10,766 --> 00:30:11,661
oh shit

321
00:30:11,661 --> 00:30:13,443
-Drop your weapon
-FBl

322
00:30:14,454 --> 00:30:15,421
look out

323
00:30:18,832 --> 00:30:20,005
get out of here

324
00:30:24,436 --> 00:30:25,789
get out of here, Dom

325
00:30:30,184 --> 00:30:31,912
run him down

326
00:30:34,338 --> 00:30:35,189
Campos is Braga

327
00:30:42,753 --> 00:30:43,818
come on

328
00:30:50,962 --> 00:30:52,798
found primary target

329
00:30:53,882 --> 00:30:55,161
primary suspect is secure

330
00:30:55,161 --> 00:30:56,728
let’s go

331
00:30:56,728 --> 00:30:58,026
get up

332
00:30:58,035 --> 00:31:00,210
he was under your nose the whole time

333
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:01,733
Braga's escaped

334
00:31:01,733 --> 00:31:04,651
tried exiting south
be long across the border right now

335
00:31:04,651 --> 00:31:07,328
-you have any idea what kind of touble
you are in, now, O'Conner

336
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:09,065
I was doing my job

337
00:31:09,646 --> 00:31:12,700
-this ain't the first bad guy you helped
escape the law's grasp

338
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:16,638
as of now you’re being taken off active duty
untill we make a formal inquiry

339
00:31:19,047 --> 00:31:20,497
- what about Braga?

340
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,201
- that's not one of your concerns

341
00:31:34,231 --> 00:31:35,519
- we now know where Braga is, right ?

342
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,564
- customs checked him via satellite
his home base is in Mexico

343
00:31:38,564 --> 00:31:40,963
- Mexico is out of our jurisdiction

344
00:31:44,257 --> 00:31:45,161
... the fact is

345
00:31:45,161 --> 00:31:48,743
the press will be so busy
holding press conferences over the seizure

346
00:31:48,743 --> 00:31:51,187
-we'll skate under the radar

347
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,747
- I thought we signed on to do the right thing

348
00:32:31,643 --> 00:32:33,380
- everyone's looking for you

349
00:32:34,373 --> 00:32:35,475
I’m right here

350
00:32:37,095 --> 00:32:41,025
-is nice to see you've gone with the times, and Switched to an electronic fuel injection
-it looks good

351
00:32:42,789 --> 00:32:44,974
possibly, it can look good

352
00:32:48,751 --> 00:32:50,076
I’m going with you

353
00:32:54,149 --> 00:32:56,791
I don't plan on bringing anyone back

354
00:32:58,652 --> 00:32:59,888
I know

355
00:33:07,598 --> 00:33:09,586
hit that throttle

356
00:34:16,208 --> 00:34:18,840
-hate to say goodbye to my only brother

357
00:34:21,275 --> 00:34:22,484
you don’t

358
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:58,545
( U. S MEXICO BOADER)

359
00:35:28,769 --> 00:35:30,469
I thought you wasn’t going to show up

360
00:35:30,469 --> 00:35:32,591
you saved my life

361
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:35,357
I’m willing to return the favour

362
00:35:39,493 --> 00:35:42,000
this will help get you to Braga

363
00:35:46,091 --> 00:35:47,103
Dom

364
00:35:47,927 --> 00:35:50,899
going in there is suicide

365
00:35:57,714 --> 00:35:59,496
I have no choice

366
00:36:04,032 --> 00:36:06,127
you must have loved her very much

367

( Speaking Spanish)

368
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:24,724
So this's where my jurisdiction ends?

369
00:36:30,785 --> 00:36:33,130
This, is where mine begins

you ain't forgiven

380
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,840
you boys want to arrest me?

( Speaking Spanish)

382
00:38:48,018 --> 00:38:49,826
No it's beyond that

383
00:38:51,428 --> 00:38:53,711
you can't buy your way in this one

384
00:38:54,893 --> 00:38:56,290
you and me

385
00:38:58,026 --> 00:39:00,444
you and me, we are not so different

386
00:39:02,485 --> 00:39:03,308
you're no hero

387
00:39:14,249 --> 00:39:15,476
you're right

388
00:39:18,868 --> 00:39:21,795
and that's why you're going back across the border

389
00:39:27,472 --> 00:39:29,351
but Phoenix's mine

390
00:39:30,351 --> 00:39:32,249

00:39:52,386 --> 00:39:53,685

we'll make couple of miles out if you're lucky

393
00:40:52,404 --> 00:40:54,042
you know where you’re going?

394
00:40:55,394 --> 00:40:57,292
You want to borrow my GPS?

395
00:41:01,106 --> 00:41:04,042
Where you're boys at?
Are they going to show up or what?

396
00:41:07,937 --> 00:41:09,521
Be careful what you ask for

397
00:41:25,206 --> 00:41:27,283
just stop, just stop the car

398
00:41:46,575 --> 00:41:48,080
right behind you

402
00:42:45,009 --> 00:42:45,832
Yeah, hold on

403
00:42:49,172 --> 00:42:50,684
this might hurt

404
00:43:03,898 --> 00:43:05,340
it’s now or never baby

405
00:43:33,298 --> 00:43:35,160

406
00:43:35,169 --> 00:43:36,790

you'll be alright

414
00:47:29,072 --> 00:47:30,934
you have to get out of here

415
00:47:33,853 --> 00:47:35,822
I ain't running anymore

416
00:47:42,328 --> 00:47:44,065
-can I ask you something
-yeah

417
00:47:45,786 --> 00:47:49,725
you know I would of won that race if you didn’t cheat, right?

418
00:47:52,402 --> 00:47:54,156
You did hit your head hard

419
00:47:59,134 --> 00:48:00,728
don’t make me laugh

420
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,411
All rise

421
00:48:17,317 --> 00:48:19,358
please be seated

422
00:48:23,011 --> 00:48:24,774
please rise, Mr Toretto

423
00:48:27,263 --> 00:48:28,919
I've listened to the Testimony

424
00:48:28,919 --> 00:48:31,873
... and taken into special consideration
agent O'Conner's

425
00:48:32,873 --> 00:48:36,580
appeal of clemency on behalf
of Mr Toretto

426
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:39,833
his action directly resulted in
the apprehention to known drug trafficer

427
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:42,411
Arturo Braga

428
00:48:43,413 --> 00:48:44,363
however

429
00:48:45,616 --> 00:48:47,755
this Judiciory finds

430
00:48:47,755 --> 00:48:52,581
one right does not make up for
a life time worth of wrongs

431
00:48:53,581 --> 00:48:55,282
... and as such

432
00:48:55,282 --> 00:49:00,134
I find that I'm forced to
level the maximum sentence under California law

433
00:49:01,927 --> 00:49:03,449
Dominic Torretto

434
00:49:04,449 --> 00:49:12,560
you are here by sentenced to serve 25 years to life
at the lamppon maximum security prison system

435
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:15,613
