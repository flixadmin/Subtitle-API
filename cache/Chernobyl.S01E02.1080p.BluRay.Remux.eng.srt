That number's been bothering me

(HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING)

00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:42,966
How does a nuclear reactor work?

192

- SHCHERBINA: It's a simple question.

193
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:49,181
It's hardly a simple answer.

194
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:52,517
Of course, you presume
I'm too stupid to understand.

195
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:56,646

or I'll have one of these soldiers
throw you out of the helicopter.

197
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:13,121
A nuclear reactor makes
electricity with steam.

198
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,583
The steam turns a turbine
which generates electricity.

199
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,543
Where a typical power plant

200
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:20,879
makes steam by burning coal,

201
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,923
a nuclear plant...

202
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:32,516
In a nuclear plant,
we use something called fission.

203
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:38,814
We take an unstable element
like uranium-235,

204
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:41,566
which has too many neutrons.

205
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,568
- A neutron is, uh...
- The bullet.

206
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:47,614
Yes, the bullet.

207
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,576
So, bullets are flying off
of uranium.

208
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,661
Now,

209
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:57,374
if we put enough uranium atoms
close together,

210
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,670
the bullets from one atom
will eventually strike another atom.

211
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:05,590
The force of this impact
splits that atom apart,

212
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:08,760
releasing a tremendous
amount of energy, fission.

213
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:11,763
- And the graphite?
- Ah... Yes.

214
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:15,934
The neutrons are actually traveling
so fast, we call this "flux."

215
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,812
It's relatively unlikely
that the uranium atoms

216
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:20,188
will ever hit one another.

217
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:25,694
In RBMK reactors, we surround
the fuel rods with graphite

218
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:29,948
to moderate, slow down,
the neutron flux.

219
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:35,036

you've been saying dangerous things.

Why did I see graphite on the roof?

335
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:15,723
Graphite is only found in the core,

336
00:25:15,807 --> 00:25:18,726
where it's used as
a neutron flux moderator.

Well, that can't be.

Comrade Shcherbina,
my apologies, but graphite...

That's not possible.

342

Perhaps you saw burnt concrete.

343
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:36,577
Now there you made a mistake,

344
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:39,622
because I may not know much
about nuclear reactors,

345

- I understand.

Our high-range dosimeter just arrived.

350
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:57,223
We could cover one of our trucks
with lead shielding,

mount the dosimeter on the front.

352

Have one of your men
get as close to the fire as he can.

353

Give him every bit
of protection you have.

354
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,824
But understand that even with
lead shielding, it may not be enough.

363
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:04,827
It means the core is open.

It means the fire
we're watching with our own eyes

is giving off nearly
twice the radiation

The Soviet version is this,

One of the atomic reactors

521
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:01,627
at the Chernobyl Atomic Power Plant
near the city of Kiev was damaged,

that people were injured
and may have died.

The Soviets may have been fairly quick
to acknowledge the accident

Yes,

But first...

569
00:46:58,483 --> 00:47:01,695
it's going to burn through
the biological shield here by Tuesday.

570
00:47:01,778 --> 00:47:03,238
And when it does,

571
00:47:03,321 --> 00:47:06,241
it's going to hit these tanks,
bubbler pools, reservoirs...

Nuclear fuel doesn't turn cold

simply because it is not on fire.

606
00:49:13,368 --> 00:49:14,661
In fact, the temperature
will likely rise

607
00:49:14,744 --> 00:49:17,664
as a result of the blanket of sand
we've dropped.

608
00:49:17,747 --> 00:49:20,583
The uranium will melt the sand,

609

00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:56,054
as well as a portion of Minsk.

640
00:50:56,638 --> 00:50:59,474
The release of radiation
will be severe

641
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:01,100
and will impact

642
00:51:01,184 --> 00:51:05,438
all of Soviet Ukraine,
Latvia, Lithuania,

643
00:51:05,521 --> 00:51:09,943
Byelorussia, as well as Poland,
Czechoslovakia, Hungary,

644
00:51:10,026 --> 00:51:12,320
Romania, and most of East Germany.

645
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:18,993
What do you mean "impact?"

646
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:22,580
For much of the area,
a nearly permanent disruption

647
00:51:22,664 --> 00:51:24,374
of the food and water supply,

648
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:28,294
a steep increase in the rates
of cancer and birth defects.

649
00:51:28,378 --> 00:51:30,880
I don't know how many deaths
there will be, but many.

650
00:51:31,798 --> 00:51:33,633
For Byelorussia and the Ukraine,

651
00:51:33,716 --> 00:51:36,386
"impact" means
completely uninhabitable

652
00:51:36,469 --> 00:51:38,972
for a minimum of 100 years.

653
00:51:43,476 --> 00:51:46,813
There are more than 50 million people

654
00:51:46,896 --> 00:51:49,607
living in Byelorussia and Ukraine.

655
00:51:49,691 --> 00:51:51,651
Sixty, yes.

656
00:51:55,989 --> 00:51:57,740
And how long before this happens?

657
00:51:58,241 --> 00:52:00,618
Approximately 48 to 72 hours.

658
00:52:05,373 --> 00:52:07,625
But we may have a solution.

659
00:52:07,709 --> 00:52:09,669
We can pump the water from the tanks.

660
00:52:09,752 --> 00:52:12,922
Unfortunately, the tanks are
sealed shut by a sluice gate,

661
00:52:13,006 --> 00:52:14,632
and the gate can only be opened

662
00:52:14,716 --> 00:52:16,676
manually from within
the duct system itself.

663
00:52:16,759 --> 00:52:20,054
So, we need to find
three plant workers

664
00:52:20,138 --> 00:52:22,557
who know the facility well enough
to enter the basement,

665
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:27,478
here, find their way through
all these duct ways,

666
00:52:27,562 --> 00:52:29,939
get to the sluice gate valve here,

667
00:52:30,023 --> 00:52:34,277
and give us the access we need
to pump out the tanks.

668
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:37,238
Of course, we will need
your permission.

669
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:39,365
My permission for what?

670
00:52:39,449 --> 00:52:42,035
LEGASOV: Uh, the water in these ducts,

671
00:52:42,118 --> 00:52:44,912
the level of
radioactive contamination...

672
00:52:44,996 --> 00:52:46,789
They'll likely be dead in a week.

673
00:52:49,125 --> 00:52:52,670
We're asking for your permission
to kill three men.

674
00:53:00,803 --> 00:53:02,472
Well...

675
00:53:02,555 --> 00:53:05,725
Comrade Legasov, (CLEARS THROAT)

676
00:53:05,808 --> 00:53:08,478
all victories inevitably
come at a cost.

677

(WATER DRIPPING)

678
00:54:34,105 --> 00:54:37,150
And open the sluice gate valve, here.

679
00:54:37,942 --> 00:54:41,946
The valve will be difficult
to operate, so we'll need three men

680
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:45,616
who will need to know
the basement layout.

681
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:49,495
And, of course, any volunteers
will be rewarded.

682
00:54:49,996 --> 00:54:53,332
A yearly stipend of 400 rubles.

683
00:55:00,298 --> 00:55:05,052
And, uh, for those of you working
in reactors one and two, promotions.

684
00:55:05,136 --> 00:55:08,931
(CLEARS THROAT) Why are reactors
one and two still operating at all?

685
00:55:09,474 --> 00:55:12,768
My friend was a security guard
that night, and, uh, she's now dying.

686
00:55:13,352 --> 00:55:15,605
And we've all heard about the firemen.

687
00:55:15,688 --> 00:55:19,650
And now you want us to swim
underneath a burning reactor?

688
00:55:20,318 --> 00:55:22,361
Do you even know
how contaminated it is?

689
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:24,071
(CLEARS THROAT)

690
00:55:24,697 --> 00:55:26,532
I don't have an exact number.

691
00:55:26,616 --> 00:55:29,827
You don't need an exact number
to know if it will kill us.

692
00:55:29,911 --> 00:55:31,162
But you can't even tell us that.

693
00:55:33,289 --> 00:55:35,625
Why should we do this?
For what, 400 rubles?

694
00:55:35,708 --> 00:55:37,335
(SOFT MURMURING)

695
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:41,380
You'll do it because it must be done.

696
00:55:46,552 --> 00:55:49,096
You'll do it because nobody else can.

697
00:55:52,225 --> 00:55:55,811
And if you don't, millions will die.

698
00:55:57,063 --> 00:55:59,398
If you tell me that's not enough,
I won't believe you.

699
00:56:01,234 --> 00:56:05,363
This is what has always
set our people apart.

700
00:56:05,446 --> 00:56:08,366
A thousand years of sacrifice
in our veins.

701
00:56:09,408 --> 00:56:11,869
And every generation
must know its own suffering.

702
00:56:12,912 --> 00:56:15,998
I spit on the people who did this,

703
00:56:16,082 --> 00:56:18,000
and I curse the price I have to pay.

704
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:25,091
But I'm making my peace with it,
now you make yours.

705
00:56:25,633 --> 00:56:27,301
And go into that water.
