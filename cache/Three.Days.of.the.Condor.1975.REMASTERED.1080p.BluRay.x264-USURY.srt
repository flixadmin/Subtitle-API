1
00:01:46,834 --> 00:01:48,042
So tell her what you got.

2
00:01:48,167 --> 00:01:51,667
Male, Caucasian, mid-40s,
appears to have been shot.

3
00:01:51,792 --> 00:01:53,251
- Where?
- In his room.

4
00:01:53,376 --> 00:01:55,542
- Very funny, Harold.
- OK, OK.

5
00:01:55,667 --> 00:01:57,084
The wound is just below the heart.

6
00:01:57,209 --> 00:01:59,126
- Was he shot once?
- Seems to have been, yeah.

7
00:01:59,251 --> 00:02:01,792
First you said,
"Appears to have been shot..."

8
00:02:01,917 --> 00:02:03,418
Mr Turner.

9
00:02:08,834 --> 00:02:11,500
Dr Lappe, I'm sure he's gonna be here
any second now.

10
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:12,917
Really?

11
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:16,834
Mr Turner's late again.

12
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:35,625
Just get back to work.

13
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,126
Come on. We can dope it out
in five minutes and get back to work.

14
00:02:38,251 --> 00:02:40,084
If Joey were here,
you know what he would say...

15
00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:44,583
- Joey isn't the only mind in this place.
- Come on. What calibre slug?

16
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:46,917
- You're missing the point, Ray.
- What do you mean?

17
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:49,418
The machine will come back
with a "Rephrase"

18
00:02:49,542 --> 00:02:51,418
or "Please express in other words."

19
00:02:51,542 --> 00:02:52,959
Well, so what do you want to feed in?

20
00:03:55,084 --> 00:03:57,625
- Turner, Joseph. No middle initial.
- You're 17 minutes late.

21
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,917
Make it 12, will you?
I was bucking headwinds.

22
00:04:00,042 --> 00:04:03,084
Dr Lappe,
anything in the early pouch for me?

23
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,251
- Dr Lappe. Is there anything...
- Yes?

24
00:04:06,376 --> 00:04:08,500
Nothing in response to your report.

25
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:11,459
And please have the book
I left on your desk analysed

26
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,625
- and on the computer by four o'clock.
- Yes, sir.

27
00:04:15,042 --> 00:04:17,376
Better get the <i>tolmieas</i>
moved closer to the light, Doctor.

28
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,834
You're getting a blight on the leaf.

29
00:04:22,167 --> 00:04:24,209
At ease, Sarge. At ease.

30
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,418
Going to rain today. 10:20.

31
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:33,792
- There's got to be more details.
- I only read two chapters.

32
00:04:33,917 --> 00:04:35,750
- No other clues?
- Not so far.

33
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,334
What time did they find him?

34
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:39,750
Just the same afternoon,
just early evening.

35
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:42,334
They never said
what the calibre of the bullet was.

36
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:45,209
- Apparently a .38.
- There it is again, "apparently."

37
00:04:45,334 --> 00:04:48,542
Well, it made an entry wound
characteristic of a .38,

38
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:50,500
but they couldn't recover
the slug itself.

39
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,917
Hey, we're getting somewhere.

40
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:56,750
You guys figure it out.
I have <i>Far East</i> journals to read.

41
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:58,583
Hey, was the slug
smashed against the wall?

42
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:01,959
No. As a matter of fact,
there was no exit wound.

43
00:05:02,084 --> 00:05:05,167
We're not getting anywhere.
Finish the book, Harold.

44
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:13,042
- Hi. What we've got so far is...
- Ice.

45
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:16,042
Instead of lead. Ice.

46
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,167
The murderer pours water
into a .38 calibre mould

47
00:05:19,292 --> 00:05:21,583
and freezes it
and keeps it solid until the crime.

48
00:05:21,709 --> 00:05:22,959
- Great.
- Then he shoots the guy

49
00:05:23,084 --> 00:05:24,126
with the ice bullet.

50
00:05:24,251 --> 00:05:27,500
Cops show up in a half an hour,
and there's just a few drops of water.

51
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:30,376
- No bullet, no ballistics.
- That's great.

52
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,834
- Hey.
- Yeah?

53
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:36,042
What is this?

54
00:05:38,084 --> 00:05:40,834
- Calligraphy's getting beautiful.
- What is it?

55
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:43,875
- That means heaven.
- That's it? Nothing else?

56
00:05:44,001 --> 00:05:47,959
Well, it can mean "the best."
"Tops" sometimes. Why?

57
00:05:50,126 --> 00:05:51,792
I'm not sure.

58
00:05:51,917 --> 00:05:53,667
We're going to Sam
and Mae's tonight, right?

59
00:05:53,792 --> 00:05:54,834
Mmm-hmm.

60
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,625
Well, why don't you talk
to Sam about it?

61
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,084
- About this? I did.
- Mmm-hmm.

62
00:05:59,209 --> 00:06:02,376
He says, "Well, that's interesting,
but it's not my department."

63
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,625
Which means he doesn't think
there's anything, just like Dr Lappe.

64
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:10,667
- And you.
- Well, there's not much.

65
00:06:10,792 --> 00:06:13,792
- A mystery that's been translated?
- A mystery that didn't sell,

66
00:06:13,917 --> 00:06:16,625
that's been translated into
a very odd assortment of languages.

67
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:20,542
Turkish, but not French.
Arabic, but not Russian or German.

68
00:06:21,209 --> 00:06:22,542
Dutch.

69
00:06:22,667 --> 00:06:25,500
- Spanish?
- Yes.

70
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,792
Yes.

71
00:06:28,917 --> 00:06:30,750
Hey, where'd you get that thing
about the ice?

72
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,667
- Dashiell Hammett?
- Dick Tracy.

73
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:35,292
Are you sure about this ideogram?

74
00:06:36,418 --> 00:06:40,084
Look at this face.
Could I be wrong about an ideogram?

75
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:45,709
It's a great face,
but it's never been to China.

76
00:06:55,709 --> 00:06:57,625
Ray, when can I get
some computer time?

77
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,625
- Dick Tracy?
- He was a very underrated detective.

78
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,334
There's some free time at 2:45.

79
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:04,292
Morning pickup.

80
00:07:04,418 --> 00:07:07,625
No, no, no, no.
Stay on schedule. I'll get it.

81
00:07:10,376 --> 00:07:11,750
- Four pieces, right?
- Right.

82
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,917
- Hold it. Hold it.
- Five.

83
00:07:14,042 --> 00:07:17,001
- Affirmative. Fiver.
- Where is Mr Heidegger?

84
00:07:17,126 --> 00:07:18,834
He called in sick, Dr Lappe.

85
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:20,209
He's probably hungover again.

86
00:07:20,334 --> 00:07:22,750
This is extraordinary.
I was just checking the files

87
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,959
and I came across this carbon copy

88
00:07:25,084 --> 00:07:27,500
of an inquiry he sent
to Persian Gulf command.

89
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,292
He did that for me.

90
00:07:30,834 --> 00:07:32,334
It never went through my office.

91
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:33,917
I asked him to do
some research for me.

92
00:07:34,042 --> 00:07:35,834
I guess he didn't feel
it was that important.

93
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:39,334
I wish you people
would go through channels.

94
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:50,167
What's on your mind?

95
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:52,042
OK.

96
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:41,251
This was in the pouch
from New York Center.

97
00:08:41,376 --> 00:08:44,583
HQ at Langley said there's nothing
from any other intelligence source

98
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:47,418
- to support your theory.
- Gentlemen.

99
00:08:47,542 --> 00:08:49,251
Is this your idea
of working on that book?

100
00:08:49,376 --> 00:08:50,792
I'll have it on the computer by 4:00.

101
00:08:50,917 --> 00:08:53,292
We have people
to service these machines.

102
00:08:53,418 --> 00:08:56,084
These things are really pretty simple.
They just look complicated.

103
00:08:56,209 --> 00:09:01,709
Mr Turner, I wonder if
you're entirely happy here.

104
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:05,042
- Within obvious limits, yes, sir.
- Obvious limits?

105
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:07,583
It bothers me
that I can't tell people what I do.

106
00:09:07,709 --> 00:09:10,418
Why is it taking you so long
to accept that?

107
00:09:10,542 --> 00:09:16,042
Well, I actually trust a few people.
That's a problem.

108
00:09:16,792 --> 00:09:19,959
Well, I believe it's your turn
to bring in lunch.

109
00:09:20,084 --> 00:09:21,959
What time is it?

110
00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:26,709
- 11:22.
- The rain's gonna stop by 11:30.

111
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:29,292
You can wait eight minutes.

112
00:09:30,376 --> 00:09:31,792
Yes, yes.

113
00:10:12,376 --> 00:10:14,667
Mr Turner? Hey! Hey!

114
00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:18,292
Damn it. It's not a proper exit.

115
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:21,167
He always goes out that way
when it rains. Saves him a block.

116
00:10:21,292 --> 00:10:25,625
Personnel should enter and exit
the premises by authorised means only.

117
00:11:13,126 --> 00:11:14,834
Jimmy.

118
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,542
- Hey, Shakespeare, how's it going?
- Terrific.

119
00:11:17,667 --> 00:11:19,875
I'm building up a great collection
of rejection slips.

120
00:11:20,001 --> 00:11:23,792
Yeah, I know the feeling.
I always wanted to be Escoffier.

121
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:26,209
Well, maybe it's not too late.
You know, Van Gogh was 30

122
00:11:26,334 --> 00:11:28,167
- before he started to paint.
- No kidding?

123
00:11:28,292 --> 00:11:30,667
There's no mayonnaise on Dr Lappe's.

124
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:34,334
On the other hand, Mozart was three
when he started to play the piano,

125
00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:37,376
- and he was composing at six.
- Fast starter. It's probably better.

126
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,500
I don't know.

127
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,875
Van Gogh never sold a painting
in a whole lifetime.

128
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:43,667
Mozart died a pauper.

129
00:11:43,792 --> 00:11:45,625
Where am I,
the New York Public Library?

130
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,292
Hey, that's a very bright man.

131
00:11:47,418 --> 00:11:49,792
It's very educational.
That's why I come in here.

132
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:52,251
You come in here to get sick,
just like everybody else.

133
00:11:52,376 --> 00:11:53,875
Hey, come on.

134
00:11:54,001 --> 00:11:56,959
Hey, no butter on Ray's sandwich.
He gets very panicky about butter.

135
00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:20,959
Give it to Jennings in the back.
He'll sign for it. Just...

136
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:23,709
Edwina Rose...

137
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,834
Mrs Russell,
was the Kirkus report in this...

138
00:14:18,042 --> 00:14:19,209
Wait, wait, wait!

139
00:14:52,667 --> 00:14:55,459
Would you move
from the window, please?

140
00:14:57,792 --> 00:14:58,834
Pardon?

141
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,750
Would you move
from the window, please?

142
00:15:13,251 --> 00:15:15,209
I won't scream.

143
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:18,709
I know.

144
00:16:01,834 --> 00:16:04,542
A little breakdown
in the security there?

145
00:16:05,334 --> 00:16:07,750
Well, what... What are you doing?

146
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:17,917
What...

147
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:12,792
Come on, now.
Now, come on.

148
00:17:38,209 --> 00:17:39,418
Harold.

149
00:20:00,792 --> 00:20:02,792
For Christ's sake!
What the hell you doing, Mac?

150
00:20:02,917 --> 00:20:04,542
Do your sleeping at night, will you?

151
00:20:29,834 --> 00:20:32,418
- This is the Major.
- This is Joe Turner. Listen...

152
00:20:32,542 --> 00:20:33,875
- Identification.
- What?

153
00:20:34,001 --> 00:20:35,376
'Identification.'

154
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,376
My name is Turner.
I work for you. Now listen...

155
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,875
- Identify yourself.
- I... I don't...

156
00:20:40,001 --> 00:20:41,625
'What is your designation?'

157
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,084
Condor.

158
00:20:43,834 --> 00:20:46,418
Section 9, department 17.
The section's been hit.

159
00:20:46,542 --> 00:20:47,917
- What level?
- What level?

160
00:20:48,042 --> 00:20:50,500
- Level of damage.
- Everybody.

161
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:54,334
Dr Lappe, Janice, Ray, Harold.
Harold was in the...

162
00:20:54,459 --> 00:20:56,084
'Are you on a company line?'

163
00:20:56,209 --> 00:20:59,209
No, no. I'm in a phone booth.
I'm just a block away. I'm in the street.

164
00:20:59,334 --> 00:21:02,042
You're in violation of secure
communication procedures, Condor.

165
00:21:02,167 --> 00:21:04,750
Listen, you son of a bitch!
I'm telling you, I came back with lunch,

166
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:07,750
and it was raining, and the whole house
was murdered. Everybody is dead.

167
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:11,625
'Right. Has the incident been discovered
by anyone outside the company?'

168
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,959
I don't... I don't know.
I don't think so.

169
00:21:14,084 --> 00:21:15,834
'Are you damaged?'

170
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,834
Damaged?

171
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,126
- No.
- Are you armed?

172
00:21:22,667 --> 00:21:25,917
I don't... I have Mrs... I don't...
I can't remember her code name.

173
00:21:26,042 --> 00:21:27,084
Nightingale.

174
00:21:27,209 --> 00:21:29,625
She was afraid of being raped.
She kept a gun. I've got the gun.

175
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:30,792
Identify the armament.

176
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,625
It's a .45 automatic.
Will you guys bring me in, please?

177
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,834
I'm not a field agent.
I just read books.

178
00:21:37,959 --> 00:21:40,418
- Leave the area.
- All right. Well...

179
00:21:40,542 --> 00:21:42,209
Well, do I come in
to headquarters now?

180
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:44,792
'Negative. Find a secure location.'

181
00:21:45,792 --> 00:21:47,583
- Where?
- Avoid any place you're known.

182
00:21:47,709 --> 00:21:48,792
Do not go home.

183
00:21:48,917 --> 00:21:51,001
Do not go home.

184
00:21:51,126 --> 00:21:54,376
Surface again in two hours,
and call the Major.

185
00:21:56,042 --> 00:21:58,418
That'll be 14:30, your time.

186
00:21:58,542 --> 00:22:00,959
Wait a minute.
All right. 2:30, right?

187
00:22:01,084 --> 00:22:04,001
'Now, walk away from the phone.
Don't hang it up.'

188
00:22:04,126 --> 00:22:05,459
Don't...

189
00:22:18,042 --> 00:22:20,126
This is the panic officer.

190
00:22:20,251 --> 00:22:22,167
Section 9-17 may have been hit.

191
00:22:22,292 --> 00:22:28,750
'Activate following procedures:
NY 127, DC 469er.

192
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:31,001
'Replay of the report upcoming.
Stand by.'

193
00:23:23,667 --> 00:23:25,209
'Augie One to New York Center.'

194
00:23:25,334 --> 00:23:27,542
This is New York Center.
Go ahead, Augie One.

195
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:29,667
- 'Who am I talking to?'
- Higgins, Deputy Director.

196
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,792
- I'm holding the baby, go ahead.
- Hit confirmed.

197
00:23:31,917 --> 00:23:33,959
Maximum as reported. Six cold items.

198
00:23:34,084 --> 00:23:36,834
- What was the quality of work?
- Clean, fast, first-rate.

199
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:39,251
Did you say six?

200
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:41,126
'Excepting Condor,
there should be seven.'

201
00:23:41,251 --> 00:23:44,084
Repeat. Six.
Here's a rundown on those items.

202
00:23:44,209 --> 00:23:48,500
Lappe, Chong, Russell,
Jennings, Martin, Mitchell.

203
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:51,251
All right, Augie One. Find seven.

204
00:23:56,042 --> 00:23:57,500
Thank you.

205
00:24:01,667 --> 00:24:03,084
Condor.

206
00:24:05,667 --> 00:24:09,583
Researcher type
who likes to read comic strips.

207
00:25:10,792 --> 00:25:12,167
Who is it?

208
00:25:33,126 --> 00:25:34,583
Jesus.

209
00:25:50,126 --> 00:25:52,084
Hey, you. You ring my buzzer?

210
00:25:53,209 --> 00:25:56,251
- It was a mistake, buddy.
- Not you guys.

211
00:26:02,001 --> 00:26:03,500
Hey. Hey!

212
00:26:03,625 --> 00:26:05,750
Hey, who are you?

213
00:26:06,292 --> 00:26:07,959
Hey, who the hell are you?

214
00:26:09,126 --> 00:26:12,334
'Augie Three here.
We found item seven, Ralph Heidegger.

215
00:26:12,459 --> 00:26:13,500
'He bought it at home.'

216
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:16,334
'OK. Button it up, Augie.
I'll send you more janitors.'

217
00:26:17,625 --> 00:26:20,709
- 'Yes, sir.'
- 'I need Langley right away.'

218
00:26:22,126 --> 00:26:23,167
'Garber speaking.'

219
00:26:23,292 --> 00:26:27,500
'This is Higgins, Deputy Director,
New York. Let me have department 17.'

220
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:35,500
Somebody took out
one of your sections.

221
00:26:35,625 --> 00:26:37,500
- What?
- 9-17.

222
00:26:37,625 --> 00:26:40,251
That's New York.
Somebody got mugged, maybe.

223
00:26:40,376 --> 00:26:42,167
They were hit.

224
00:26:42,292 --> 00:26:45,042
- They're bookworms, for Christ's sake.
- They got seven out of eight.

225
00:26:45,167 --> 00:26:47,334
We're on the shuttle to LaGuardia side.
30 minutes.

226
00:26:47,459 --> 00:26:49,042
You say one of my people is still OK?

227
00:26:49,167 --> 00:26:50,750
- Condor. You know him?
- No.

228
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:52,292
Is he OK enough
to say what happened?

229
00:26:52,418 --> 00:26:55,001
They didn't touch him.
He was literally out to lunch.

230
00:26:55,126 --> 00:26:57,583
- What does he say happened?
- He's not in yet.

231
00:26:57,709 --> 00:26:59,834
First call was a little wild, scared.

232
00:26:59,959 --> 00:27:01,709
- Who's bringing him in?
- Higgins.

233
00:27:01,834 --> 00:27:03,334
- Higgins.
- 'Transportation.'

234
00:27:03,459 --> 00:27:06,334
- We're already booked on the shuttle.
- This is Wicks, OIC department 17.

235
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:09,542
I want a chopper on the pad,
fuelled for New York, now.

236
00:27:25,084 --> 00:27:27,792
- Hey, Lois.
- They're waiting for you.

237
00:27:27,917 --> 00:27:29,334
- What?
- Your two friends.

238
00:27:33,292 --> 00:27:34,875
They said you'd be home early.

239
00:27:35,001 --> 00:27:38,251
They just got here.
Said you gave them the keys.

240
00:27:41,209 --> 00:27:42,709
Mr Turner?

241
00:28:15,334 --> 00:28:17,709
- This is the Major.
- 'This is Condor.'

242
00:28:17,834 --> 00:28:21,376
Stand by, Condor.
I'm routing you to New York Center.

243
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:25,834
'Condor 1-1, Mr Higgins.'

244
00:28:27,042 --> 00:28:28,709
Hello, Condor.

245
00:28:28,834 --> 00:28:29,917
'Who is this?'

246
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,750
Deputy Director Higgins,
New York Center.

247
00:28:31,875 --> 00:28:33,917
I'm controlling now, Condor.
Where are you?

248
00:28:34,042 --> 00:28:36,042
How come I need a code name
and you don't?

249
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,750
Where are you, Turner?

250
00:28:41,167 --> 00:28:42,209
Here.

251
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:47,459
- You all right?
- Are you insane? Everybody's dead.

252
00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:51,334
Take it easy. Just take it easy,
and we'll bring you home.

253
00:28:51,459 --> 00:28:54,167
Now, here's how we'll do it.
Do you know the Ansonia Hotel?

254
00:28:54,292 --> 00:28:58,292
- 'Broadway and 71st.'
- Broadway and 73rd.

255
00:28:59,042 --> 00:29:01,792
There's an alley behind the hotel.

256
00:29:01,917 --> 00:29:04,500
One hour from now at exactly 15:30,

257
00:29:04,625 --> 00:29:07,875
I want you to enter that alley
from the 73rd Street side.

258
00:29:08,001 --> 00:29:09,459
Will you be there?

259
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:14,625
The head of your department
just came here from DC.

260
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:15,834
He's gonna bring you home.

261
00:29:16,625 --> 00:29:18,709
- I've never met him.
- 'Don't worry.'

262
00:29:18,834 --> 00:29:21,126
'He's studying your photos now.'

263
00:29:23,209 --> 00:29:24,459
Turner?

264
00:29:26,667 --> 00:29:27,834
Turner.

265
00:29:31,834 --> 00:29:33,209
I don't know you, either.

266
00:29:33,334 --> 00:29:35,001
We'll meet.

267
00:29:36,334 --> 00:29:39,667
He'll be carrying a <i>Wall Street Journal</i>
in his left hand.

268
00:29:39,792 --> 00:29:42,334
- There were two guys at my house.
- What were you doing there?

269
00:29:42,459 --> 00:29:45,500
- You were told not to go there.
- I was homesick. Who were they?

270
00:29:46,292 --> 00:29:48,709
- They were ours.
- What were they doing in my house?

271
00:29:50,959 --> 00:29:53,167
I'm not going into any alley
with you or anybody,

272
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:54,709
and fuck <i>The Wall Street Journal.</i>

273
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:57,418
Turner, it's been a long, bad day.
You've been under...

274
00:29:57,542 --> 00:29:59,126
You're damn right I've been under.

275
00:30:04,292 --> 00:30:06,084
All right, Turner.

276
00:30:06,959 --> 00:30:09,126
We'll bring along a familiar face,
somebody you know.

277
00:30:10,459 --> 00:30:11,792
Who's left?

278
00:30:11,917 --> 00:30:14,917
'You got a friend in statistics
named Sam Barber.'

279
00:30:16,334 --> 00:30:17,459
Sam...

280
00:30:18,709 --> 00:30:21,792
- You guys are something.
- 'Will he do?'

281
00:30:23,334 --> 00:30:24,667
Yes, Sam will do.

282
00:30:26,418 --> 00:30:27,542
All right, Turner.

283
00:30:27,667 --> 00:30:30,625
Stay well for 60 minutes,
and you're home.

284
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:33,667
- Can I ask a question?
- 'Sure.'

285
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:36,418
What is happening?

286
00:30:37,334 --> 00:30:39,625
I'll talk to you in 60 minutes.

287
00:30:43,251 --> 00:30:44,459
You've got 55.

288
00:30:45,542 --> 00:30:47,334
This is ridiculous.

289
00:30:47,459 --> 00:30:49,583
You're not a field agent.
It's standard procedure.

290
00:30:49,709 --> 00:30:51,001
To pick up a friend?

291
00:30:51,126 --> 00:30:53,667
- What about you, Mr Wicks?
- No, thanks.

292
00:30:53,792 --> 00:30:56,334
- Side arm?
- I don't know. Have you got a .45?

293
00:30:56,459 --> 00:31:00,084
- You bet.
- Here, let me help you with that.

294
00:31:03,167 --> 00:31:04,834
How long have you known Condor?

295
00:31:04,959 --> 00:31:08,251
Who, Joey?
I knew him before he was a bird even.

296
00:31:08,376 --> 00:31:12,042
- We went to CCNY. My wife Mae, too.
- Yeah?

297
00:31:12,167 --> 00:31:15,334
- She ever Condor's girl?
- Here you go, Mr Wicks.

298
00:31:20,376 --> 00:31:23,376
Hey, can you tell me anything
about what happened today?

299
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,500
- When?
- This morning.

300
00:31:25,625 --> 00:31:27,001
All those murders.

301
00:31:28,376 --> 00:31:29,583
What murders?

302
00:32:29,292 --> 00:32:30,542
Sam?

303
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:36,834
Sam.

304
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,001
Here he is. Joe!

305
00:32:55,583 --> 00:32:56,959
Hey, Sam,

306
00:32:59,042 --> 00:33:01,376
where's that other...

307
00:33:07,209 --> 00:33:09,959
What are you doing?
It's him! It's him!

308
00:33:11,084 --> 00:33:12,251
Joe!

309
00:34:23,001 --> 00:34:25,167
Katherine Hale. H-A-L-E.

310
00:34:25,792 --> 00:34:31,542
O8, 1156, 172, 208, 875.

311
00:34:31,667 --> 00:34:34,167
Amount, $51.86.

312
00:34:34,292 --> 00:34:36,001
Where's there enough snow this early?

313
00:34:36,126 --> 00:34:39,542
- Vermont, I hope.
- What's open now, Sugarbush?

314
00:34:39,667 --> 00:34:42,001
No, I don't do downhill.
This is for cross-country.

315
00:34:42,126 --> 00:34:44,418
Don't like the lift lines, huh?

316
00:34:45,251 --> 00:34:46,875
474? Thank you.

317
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,875
Kathy!

318
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:03,750
Kathy. Where have you been?
Here, let me give you a hand.

319
00:35:03,875 --> 00:35:08,167
- Wait a minute, I don't know...
- Don't do anything. Be quiet.

320
00:35:08,292 --> 00:35:10,583
Get in the car.
Don't make a sound. Don't be dumb.

321
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:13,292
Come on. Hurry up.

322
00:35:13,418 --> 00:35:14,709
Get in.

323
00:35:19,001 --> 00:35:21,001
Listen, please don't hurt me.

324
00:35:21,126 --> 00:35:22,583
Where do you live?
Where do you live?

325
00:35:22,709 --> 00:35:24,709
- Brooklyn Heights.
- Alone?

326
00:35:24,834 --> 00:35:27,500
I live with a friend.

327
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,334
You live alone.
Come on, let's go.

328
00:38:00,418 --> 00:38:02,459
Leave the stuff.

329
00:38:09,792 --> 00:38:11,292
Hey, Kathy.

330
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:16,209
You should have said hello.

331
00:38:17,292 --> 00:38:19,251
- Where is it?
- Here.

332
00:38:25,459 --> 00:38:27,583
"Condor shot us both."

333
00:38:27,709 --> 00:38:29,834
Evidently, that was
the only statement he could make

334
00:38:29,959 --> 00:38:31,792
before they took him
into the operating room.

335
00:38:31,917 --> 00:38:34,583
And the other man,
Barber, he's dead?

336
00:38:34,709 --> 00:38:36,542
Before he hit the ground,
Mr Atwood.

337
00:38:36,667 --> 00:38:39,792
You should add that
it was a remarkable shot,

338
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:41,542
a half inch above his flak jacket.

339
00:38:41,667 --> 00:38:43,959
- I thought this guy was...
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

340
00:38:44,084 --> 00:38:46,542
Was Condor qualified with a handgun?

341
00:38:49,667 --> 00:38:52,834
Two years military service,
Signal Corps.

342
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,917
Telephone lineman, long lines,
switchboard maintenance.

343
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:57,251
Six months overseas.

344
00:38:57,376 --> 00:39:00,875
Separated 9/'61. Worked at
Bell Labs Communication Research.

345
00:39:01,001 --> 00:39:02,167
College on the GI Bill.

346
00:39:02,292 --> 00:39:05,792
The question was, Mr Higgins,
is he qualified with a handgun?

347
00:39:05,917 --> 00:39:08,251
No handgun, sir.
M1 rifle and carbine.

348
00:39:09,167 --> 00:39:11,376
Evidently, it was sheer luck.

349
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:14,126
Or else...

350
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:16,834
- Yes?
- Or else what, Mr Higgins?

351
00:39:16,959 --> 00:39:19,292
This Condor isn't the man
his file says he is.

352
00:39:19,418 --> 00:39:21,209
Then where did he learn
evasive moves?

353
00:39:21,334 --> 00:39:22,959
- He reads.
- He...

354
00:39:23,667 --> 00:39:27,376
- What the hell does that mean?
- It means, sir, that he reads everything.

355
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:31,001
- I don't understand.
- Yes. Very good.

356
00:39:31,792 --> 00:39:35,251
- Has Operations got anything?
- Absolutely nothing, sir.

357
00:39:35,376 --> 00:39:38,418
- Extraordinary.
- It was very well executed.

358
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:42,084
Which requires planning,
communications, tracks.

359
00:39:42,209 --> 00:39:44,625
I'm not asking for footprints,

360
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:48,251
but a blade of grass, a broken twig,
something disturbed.

361
00:39:48,376 --> 00:39:49,792
Yes, sir.

362
00:39:49,917 --> 00:39:53,084
- Wicks seems to be all we've got.
- Where do we have him?

363
00:39:53,209 --> 00:39:54,334
We don't.

364
00:39:58,334 --> 00:40:01,292
They rushed him to Gouverneur
Emergency before we got word.

365
00:40:01,418 --> 00:40:03,792
Maybe we should leak
the name of the hospital,

366
00:40:03,917 --> 00:40:05,792
try to get Condor to make his move.

367
00:40:05,917 --> 00:40:09,583
Of course, Len, don't expect
too many mistakes from this man.

368
00:40:09,709 --> 00:40:11,583
After all, he does seem
rather more interesting

369
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:14,709
than just another
of our reader-researchers.

370
00:40:14,834 --> 00:40:18,750
For example,
has he gone into business for himself?

371
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:23,126
Was he turned around?
Does someone operate him?

372
00:40:23,251 --> 00:40:27,500
Is he homosexual?
Broke? Vulnerable?

373
00:40:28,126 --> 00:40:31,042
Could he be a soldier of fortune?

374
00:40:31,167 --> 00:40:33,084
Did he arrange the hit?

375
00:40:33,917 --> 00:40:36,126
Is that why he's still in flight?

376
00:40:36,251 --> 00:40:40,084
Still, he may be an innocent.

377
00:40:40,209 --> 00:40:45,084
But then, why didn't he come in gently
with Mr Wicks?

378
00:40:49,376 --> 00:40:51,251
- Tentrex Industries.
- It's a cover.

379
00:40:51,376 --> 00:40:53,084
- For what?
- I work for the CIA.

380
00:40:53,709 --> 00:40:55,042
Oh, Jesus.

381
00:40:56,042 --> 00:40:59,334
Your assignment for today
was to go out and kidnap a girl.

382
00:40:59,459 --> 00:41:02,667
Look it up. Look it up.
Tentrex Industries.

383
00:41:05,917 --> 00:41:07,917
Then look up the number
for the CIA in New York.

384
00:41:08,042 --> 00:41:10,126
You mean they're listed,
like my Aunt Gladys?

385
00:41:10,251 --> 00:41:12,001
It's under "US Government Agencies."
Go on.

386
00:41:17,042 --> 00:41:20,167
Is this what you do?
This photography?

387
00:41:21,959 --> 00:41:23,042
OK.

388
00:41:24,292 --> 00:41:25,709
It's the same number.

389
00:41:25,834 --> 00:41:27,418
You could have had the card made.

390
00:41:27,542 --> 00:41:30,709
Yes, I could've made the card
in a machine, but I didn't.

391
00:41:30,834 --> 00:41:32,792
You really get into it, don't you?

392
00:41:32,917 --> 00:41:34,251
Sit down!

393
00:41:38,334 --> 00:41:39,959
I told you I had a friend.

394
00:41:42,084 --> 00:41:43,709
15 and a half, 34.

395
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,959
I dig 15 and a half 34s.
What size are you?

396
00:41:46,084 --> 00:41:47,583
- What are you, a clown?
- I'm scared!

397
00:41:47,709 --> 00:41:49,042
- So am I!
- What are you scared for?

398
00:41:49,167 --> 00:41:50,459
- You've got the gun!
- Yes!

399
00:41:54,167 --> 00:41:55,959
Yeah, and it's not enough.

400
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,834
Listen.

401
00:42:14,792 --> 00:42:17,709
I work for the CIA.
I am not a spy.

402
00:42:22,167 --> 00:42:24,167
I just read books.

403
00:42:31,625 --> 00:42:34,750
We read everything
that's published in the world.

404
00:42:35,709 --> 00:42:41,042
And we... We feed the plots,
dirty tricks, codes... into a computer,

405
00:42:41,167 --> 00:42:46,459
and the computer... checks against
actual CIA plans and operations.

406
00:42:46,917 --> 00:42:48,709
I look for leaks.
I look for new ideas.

407
00:42:50,376 --> 00:42:54,084
We read adventures
and novels and journals.

408
00:42:58,126 --> 00:42:59,542
I...

409
00:43:00,251 --> 00:43:01,959
Who'd invent a job like that?

410
00:43:04,251 --> 00:43:05,542
I... Listen!

411
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:09,084
- People are trying to kill me!
- Who?

412
00:43:09,209 --> 00:43:11,625
I don't know, but there's a reason.

413
00:43:13,334 --> 00:43:15,042
There is a reason!

414
00:43:16,667 --> 00:43:18,376
And I just need

415
00:43:19,542 --> 00:43:22,667
some safe, quiet time
to pull things together.

416
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:26,251
- Here.
- Here.

417
00:43:28,709 --> 00:43:31,500
That's only fair.

418
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:48,500
Where is the guy with the shirts?

419
00:43:49,542 --> 00:43:53,084
He's at a ski place,
in the Green Mountains.

420
00:43:55,167 --> 00:43:57,625
We just want to go
cross-country skiing

421
00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:01,583
for a couple of weeks,
away from everything.

422
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:08,709
- What time does the news go on, six?
- Six o'clock.

423
00:44:08,834 --> 00:44:10,209
40 minutes.

424
00:44:26,792 --> 00:44:30,084
- Come here.
- No, please. Please don't.

425
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:31,459
Lie down.

426
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:35,251
Lie down. Against the wall.

427
00:44:36,625 --> 00:44:39,418
Put this arm behind you,
and keep it there.

428
00:44:41,334 --> 00:44:45,292
Now you listen to me.
I am tired.

429
00:44:46,667 --> 00:44:49,292
I've got to close my eyes for a while.

430
00:44:49,834 --> 00:44:51,750
I can't think straight.

431
00:44:54,084 --> 00:44:57,042
If you try and move,
or climb off the bed,

432
00:44:58,251 --> 00:45:00,418
I'll know it. I'll feel it,

433
00:45:00,959 --> 00:45:03,209
and I promise you I'll hurt you.

434
00:45:06,001 --> 00:45:07,959
Couldn't you let me stay
in the other room?

435
00:45:08,084 --> 00:45:09,376
No.

436
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:14,542
I believe what you told me.

437
00:45:16,167 --> 00:45:17,625
No, you don't.

438
00:45:19,167 --> 00:45:20,959
I don't know if I do.

439
00:45:22,209 --> 00:45:24,500
That includes Condor, of course.

440
00:45:24,625 --> 00:45:26,542
Yes, I owe you Condor.

441
00:45:27,042 --> 00:45:29,750
- Otherwise...
- Otherwise does not exist.

442
00:45:32,167 --> 00:45:33,917
Will Condor take long?

443
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:37,209
- Do you want an estimate?
- There is a time factor.

444
00:45:37,334 --> 00:45:39,209
Always with you people.

445
00:45:41,625 --> 00:45:43,583
Condor is an amateur.

446
00:45:43,709 --> 00:45:46,167
He's lost, unpredictable,

447
00:45:47,084 --> 00:45:49,126
perhaps even sentimental.

448
00:45:50,376 --> 00:45:52,542
He could fool a professional.

449
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:57,542
Not deliberately,
but precisely because he is lost.

450
00:45:58,209 --> 00:46:00,251
He doesn't know what to do.

451
00:46:00,875 --> 00:46:02,292
Unlike Wicks,

452
00:46:03,126 --> 00:46:05,792
who has always been
entirely predictable.

453
00:46:09,376 --> 00:46:12,750
The man Condor killed in the alley.

454
00:46:13,292 --> 00:46:15,001
Some friend of his.

455
00:46:16,126 --> 00:46:18,834
- Close friend?
- I suppose so. Why?

456
00:46:18,959 --> 00:46:21,001
It interests me.
What was his name?

457
00:46:21,126 --> 00:46:23,042
I don't know.
He was nobody. He was...

458
00:46:31,459 --> 00:46:32,542
Right.

459
00:46:33,042 --> 00:46:34,750
What about Wicks?

460
00:46:39,542 --> 00:46:42,001
You want the firm to question him?

461
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:44,959
They will, you know.

462
00:46:46,625 --> 00:46:48,376
We don't want that.

463
00:46:50,292 --> 00:46:51,875
Cost you nothing.

464
00:46:52,459 --> 00:46:54,542
I was careless with Condor.

465
00:46:56,126 --> 00:46:58,459
Wicks will be done for nothing.

466
00:47:02,167 --> 00:47:05,167
- What time is it? What time is it?
- It's news time.

467
00:47:07,667 --> 00:47:08,875
Get up.

468
00:47:54,834 --> 00:47:56,418
Lonely pictures.

469
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:00,251
So?

470
00:48:03,959 --> 00:48:05,500
You're funny.

471
00:48:07,709 --> 00:48:13,001
You take pictures of... empty streets
and trees with no leaves on them.

472
00:48:14,917 --> 00:48:16,084
It's winter.

473
00:48:16,834 --> 00:48:18,500
Not quite winter.

474
00:48:20,667 --> 00:48:22,292
They look like

475
00:48:24,001 --> 00:48:25,334
November.

476
00:48:26,209 --> 00:48:28,583
Not autumn, not winter.
In-between.

477
00:48:34,126 --> 00:48:35,376
I like them.

478
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:39,792

was coming in, the section chief...

512
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:16,959
Wait a minute. He's...

513
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:19,542
Section chief would be coming in
from Washington.

514
00:50:19,667 --> 00:50:22,667
He'd have to reach Sam.
Sam would have to call me.

515
00:50:30,709 --> 00:50:31,917
'Hello?

516
00:50:34,667 --> 00:50:35,792
'Hello?'

517
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,917
- I need your car.
- That's called grand theft.

518
00:50:53,042 --> 00:50:55,625
You don't want to get in trouble
with the police.

519
00:50:58,001 --> 00:51:01,418
This guy in Vermont, what's
he gonna do when you don't show up?

520
00:51:01,542 --> 00:51:03,292
Probably call very soon now.

521
00:51:03,418 --> 00:51:05,167
Call, or do I have to worry
about him showing up here?

522
00:51:05,292 --> 00:51:06,667
You're not entitled
to personal questions.

523
00:51:06,792 --> 00:51:08,167
That gun gives you the right
to rough me up,

524
00:51:08,292 --> 00:51:10,292
- it doesn't give you the right to ask me...
- Rough you up?

525
00:51:10,418 --> 00:51:12,709
- Have I roughed you up?
- Yes! What are you doing in my house?

526
00:51:12,834 --> 00:51:14,251
Have I? Have I? Have I raped you?

527
00:51:15,376 --> 00:51:16,792
The night is young.

528
00:51:34,126 --> 00:51:36,126
You don't believe
anything I've said, do you?

529
00:51:39,459 --> 00:51:43,001
I believe you're in trouble, danger,

530
00:51:45,042 --> 00:51:47,167
but I don't know what kind,

531
00:51:47,875 --> 00:51:51,251
and I'm not sure
how much of it is made up,

532
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:53,625
real, but...

533
00:51:54,126 --> 00:51:55,959
Doesn't make any difference.
Doesn't matter.

534
00:51:56,084 --> 00:51:57,709
- Just wait a minute. Will you...
- Forget it.

535
00:51:57,834 --> 00:51:59,376
I'm trying to understand
what you're saying to me!

536
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:01,292
Go on in.

537
00:52:02,834 --> 00:52:04,209
Ow!

538
00:52:04,334 --> 00:52:06,500
What are you doing? Let me go!

539
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:12,500
You're hurting me. Wait a minute.

540
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:16,126
You bully!

541
00:52:17,042 --> 00:52:18,792
Don't tie me up! Come on, please!

542
00:52:23,084 --> 00:52:24,376
This is...

543
00:52:25,625 --> 00:52:26,792
...unfair.

544
00:52:27,959 --> 00:52:30,042
I know.

545
00:53:41,126 --> 00:53:43,959
Hi, Joey. You're early. Come on in.

546
00:53:47,084 --> 00:53:49,334
Hey, is Janice working late?

547
00:53:52,542 --> 00:53:54,126
So is Sam.

548
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:01,251
Hey, pour one for me, too,
will you, Joey?

549
00:54:02,875 --> 00:54:06,418
It's their own fault if we're zonked
when they get here.

550
00:54:09,834 --> 00:54:11,418
Hey, I've got it.

551
00:54:12,001 --> 00:54:13,875
We'll give them an hour,
and if they're not here,

552
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:17,001
then it's you and me, babe,
just like old times.

553
00:54:21,251 --> 00:54:22,418
Joey.

554
00:54:23,084 --> 00:54:24,418
What is it?

555
00:54:24,542 --> 00:54:27,126
- Hey, what is it, Joey? What?
- Mae.

556
00:54:27,917 --> 00:54:29,792
- What's wrong?
- Mae.

557
00:54:30,292 --> 00:54:32,625
How do you know Sam's working late?

558
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:35,625
- What do you think he's doing?
- When did he call?

559
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:37,750
I don't know.
Two or two-thirty.

560
00:54:37,875 --> 00:54:39,418
What did he say? Exactly.

561
00:54:39,542 --> 00:54:42,834
He didn't exactly.
He had the Center call.

562
00:54:42,959 --> 00:54:46,001
- Who at the Center?
- I didn't recognise his voice.

563
00:54:46,126 --> 00:54:49,126
It wasn't that lady that usually...

564
00:54:58,750 --> 00:54:59,917
Hello?

565
00:55:02,959 --> 00:55:04,542
- What is it?
- Third damn time tonight.

566
00:55:04,667 --> 00:55:05,709
Third time?

567
00:55:05,834 --> 00:55:07,542
It's some creepy burglar
casing the joint.

568
00:55:07,667 --> 00:55:08,917
Mae, I want you to get out of here.

569
00:55:09,042 --> 00:55:11,792
- Well, I can't, Joey. I'm cooking.
- Right now. Just do what I tell you, Mae.

570
00:55:11,917 --> 00:55:14,126
- What about dinner?
- Don't ask me. Go to Bill and Eileen's.

571
00:55:14,251 --> 00:55:16,917
- Stay there until I call.
- Joey, what's going on?

572
00:55:17,042 --> 00:55:18,084
Please.

573
00:55:18,209 --> 00:55:21,667
- Joey, you...
- Don't argue. Move! Move!

574
00:55:21,792 --> 00:55:24,334
- Joey, this is crazy.
- Go upstairs and stay there.

575
00:55:24,459 --> 00:55:27,750
Do what I'm telling you.
I'll call you. And stay there.

576
00:55:27,875 --> 00:55:30,209
- Joey. Joey, you're scaring me.
- I'll call you.

577
00:55:30,334 --> 00:55:33,500
- Do what I'm telling you, please!
- What about Sam?

578
00:56:26,792 --> 00:56:28,251
Yours?

579
00:56:32,292 --> 00:56:33,376
No.

580
00:56:40,625 --> 00:56:44,418
♪ Happy birthday to Grandpa

581
00:56:48,126 --> 00:56:50,251
You're always pushing the buttons.

582
00:56:50,376 --> 00:56:53,209
- Would you stop it, would you?
- That's nice.

583
00:56:56,959 --> 00:56:59,792
Fifth floor, ladies' underwear.

584
00:57:05,459 --> 00:57:07,167
Kids.

585
00:57:07,792 --> 00:57:10,126
Probably the same everywhere.

586
00:57:32,126 --> 00:57:34,126
This is the second floor.

587
00:57:36,917 --> 00:57:38,292
I do it all the time.

588
00:57:51,084 --> 00:57:53,209
- After you.
- No. Go ahead.

589
00:57:57,459 --> 00:57:58,875
OK.

590
00:58:37,875 --> 00:58:40,042
- Anybody here good with a coat hanger?
- What?

591
00:58:40,167 --> 00:58:41,792
I locked my keys in my car.
I need to get in.

592
00:58:41,917 --> 00:58:43,376
I'll give you some money,
couple of bucks, OK?

593
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:44,792
Anybody can get in the car?

594
00:58:44,917 --> 00:58:46,917
Come on, you can't tell me
you've never busted into a car before.

595
00:58:47,042 --> 00:58:48,709
- OK. I've busted a car. But how much?
- No, come on.

596
00:58:48,834 --> 00:58:50,917
Five bucks.
Five bucks if you help me get in my car.

597
00:58:51,042 --> 00:58:52,750
- Five bucks? Why not? Yeah.
- I don't have much time.

598
00:58:52,875 --> 00:58:54,167
- Can you give me a break?
- Yeah.

599
00:58:54,292 --> 00:58:57,167
- Do you mind?
- All right. Five bucks. Five bucks.

600
00:58:57,292 --> 00:58:59,418
- I'll be right back. Come on, man.
- You can all come.

601
00:58:59,542 --> 00:59:01,834
Have some fun.

602
00:59:19,625 --> 00:59:21,126
Damn.

603
00:59:25,376 --> 00:59:26,834
Wait a minute.

604
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,126
Give me the money.

605
00:59:31,625 --> 00:59:33,292
Hey!

606
01:00:51,418 --> 01:00:55,126
- I want you to answer the phone.
- I'm not going to answer the...

607
01:00:56,459 --> 01:00:59,709
- I'm not answering any phone!
- Answer it. Answer it.

608
01:00:59,834 --> 01:01:02,418
You answer this phone! Tell him
what a brave son of a bitch you are.

609
01:01:02,542 --> 01:01:04,542
Get in there and answer.

610
01:01:06,084 --> 01:01:08,709
I want you to be casual and nice.

611
01:01:13,917 --> 01:01:16,376
- Hello?
- 'Where the hell are you?'

612
01:01:17,126 --> 01:01:19,418
- Ben?
- 'Who do you think it is?'

613
01:01:20,542 --> 01:01:21,750
Ben.

614
01:01:22,542 --> 01:01:24,917
'You were supposed to
be up here by now.'

615
01:01:25,042 --> 01:01:27,792
- I know.
- 'You haven't even left yet.'

616
01:01:28,542 --> 01:01:30,001
I was held up.

617
01:01:31,042 --> 01:01:34,418
'Held up? That's no excuse.

618
01:01:34,542 --> 01:01:37,959
'Come on, what's going on?
Doesn't this trip matter to you?'

619
01:01:38,084 --> 01:01:40,625
- It matters.
- 'Yeah, sure.'

620
01:01:41,084 --> 01:01:42,959
- No, it does.
- 'Ah, come on. Come on.

621
01:01:43,084 --> 01:01:46,418
'This has happened over and over again.
The last minute, some excuse.'

622
01:01:46,542 --> 01:01:48,418
No, this is different.

623
01:01:48,542 --> 01:01:50,292
'What's the hold up?'

624
01:01:52,251 --> 01:01:55,334
- The car.
- 'What about it?'

625
01:01:55,459 --> 01:01:59,042
- Broke down.
- 'What do you mean? What broke down?'

626
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:02,667
- The generator went.
- 'Oh, Christ, the generator.

627
01:02:02,792 --> 01:02:05,542
- 'That's going to take forever.'
- Maybe not.

628
01:02:06,875 --> 01:02:09,334
I tried to call you before, but...

629
01:02:09,459 --> 01:02:11,750
'The generator... It's...
Look, it's gonna take too long.

630
01:02:11,875 --> 01:02:13,875
'Why don't you just...
Look, forget about the car.

631
01:02:14,001 --> 01:02:16,834
'Just take the bus up
first thing in the morning.'

632
01:02:16,959 --> 01:02:18,459
I'll try.

633
01:02:19,667 --> 01:02:21,126
'Try?

634
01:02:21,917 --> 01:02:25,625
'What's... What the hell's going on?
Are you OK? What... What's...'

635
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:28,167
No, I'm OK. I'm fine.

636
01:02:29,542 --> 01:02:31,251
'You don't sound so fine.'

637
01:02:31,376 --> 01:02:34,126
I... I wish you would understand.

638
01:02:35,334 --> 01:02:37,792
'I do. I do, I do. It's just...

639
01:02:37,917 --> 01:02:41,209
'God damn it,
I'm just disappointed, that's all.

640
01:02:42,126 --> 01:02:44,042
'I really...

641
01:02:44,167 --> 01:02:49,209
'I really wanted to be with you up here,
tonight, babe, you know?'

642
01:02:50,459 --> 01:02:51,625
I know.

643
01:02:54,334 --> 01:02:56,625
- We'll have time.
- 'Yeah.

644
01:02:57,750 --> 01:02:59,376
'Look, get...

645
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:02,667
'Get the very first bus out
in the morning, OK?'

646
01:03:03,292 --> 01:03:04,875
All right.

647
01:03:07,042 --> 01:03:09,709
- Good night, sweetheart.
- 'Good night, babe.'

648
01:03:48,376 --> 01:03:52,459
Listen, I'll be going... in the morning.

649
01:03:58,084 --> 01:03:59,334
Where?

650
01:04:09,292 --> 01:04:10,875
Was it all right?

651
01:04:13,459 --> 01:04:14,750
All right?

652
01:04:15,376 --> 01:04:18,334
Outside, was it safe?
Wherever you went.

653
01:04:20,376 --> 01:04:22,167
Oh...

654
01:04:24,126 --> 01:04:25,583
I'm not sure.

655
01:04:34,334 --> 01:04:35,542
Oh, God.

656
01:04:38,292 --> 01:04:39,792
I wish I knew more.

657
01:04:42,667 --> 01:04:44,042
About you.

658
01:04:46,459 --> 01:04:47,834
Yesterday.

659
01:04:48,917 --> 01:04:50,167
Today.

660
01:04:51,834 --> 01:04:53,917
I don't remember yesterday.

661
01:04:56,834 --> 01:04:58,459
Today it rained.

662
01:05:02,542 --> 01:05:04,917
Why did you have to
tie me up like that?

663
01:05:08,376 --> 01:05:10,709
You thought I'd call the police.

664
01:05:14,001 --> 01:05:15,625
I wouldn't have.

665
01:05:18,459 --> 01:05:19,500
Why?

666
01:05:21,917 --> 01:05:26,376
Sometimes I take a picture that

667
01:05:27,542 --> 01:05:31,376
isn't like me, but I took it,
so it is like me.

668
01:05:32,126 --> 01:05:33,542
It has to be.

669
01:05:39,126 --> 01:05:41,167
I put those pictures away.

670
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:45,001
I'd like to see those pictures.

671
01:05:45,126 --> 01:05:47,667
We don't know each other that well.

672
01:05:56,959 --> 01:05:59,500
Do you know anybody that well?

673
01:05:59,625 --> 01:06:02,126
I don't think
I want to know you very well.

674
01:06:04,792 --> 01:06:07,459
I don't think
you're gonna live much longer.

675
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:13,500
Well, I may surprise you.

676
01:06:16,376 --> 01:06:18,251
Anyway, you're not telling the truth.

677
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:21,667
- What do you mean?
- You'd rather be with somebody

678
01:06:21,792 --> 01:06:23,750
who's not going to live much longer,

679
01:06:23,875 --> 01:06:27,209
at least somebody
who would be on his way.

680
01:06:29,084 --> 01:06:31,084
- I'm not...
- You take pictures,

681
01:06:32,542 --> 01:06:34,334
beautiful pictures,

682
01:06:35,376 --> 01:06:37,251
but of empty streets

683
01:06:38,084 --> 01:06:40,459
and trees with no leaves, November.

684
01:06:41,459 --> 01:06:44,334
Why haven't you asked me
to untie your hands?

685
01:06:51,334 --> 01:06:53,500
How much do you want?

686
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:03,251
I just want to stop it.

687
01:07:10,792 --> 01:07:12,459
For a few hours.

688
01:07:15,042 --> 01:07:17,084
For the rest of the night.

689
01:07:20,792 --> 01:07:22,418
And then I'll go.

690
01:10:01,542 --> 01:10:03,209
'Joe!'

691
01:10:36,292 --> 01:10:38,334
What was his name?

692
01:10:39,126 --> 01:10:40,834
What is it Higgins said? Was it...

693
01:10:40,959 --> 01:10:43,167
'The head of your department
just came here from DC.

694
01:10:43,292 --> 01:10:45,209
- 'He's gonna bring you home.'
- 'I've never met him.'

695
01:10:54,001 --> 01:10:55,292
'Anything in the early pouch?'

696
01:10:57,583 --> 01:10:59,834
'Headquarters at Langley
says there's nothing

697
01:10:59,959 --> 01:11:03,459
'from any other intelligence source
to support your theory.'

698
01:11:06,209 --> 01:11:08,625
'Headquarters at Langley
says there's nothing

699
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:12,126
'from any other intelligence source
to support your theory.'

700
01:11:44,376 --> 01:11:45,625
Wicks.

701
01:12:11,376 --> 01:12:13,959
- You didn't sleep well.
- You didn't?

702
01:12:15,251 --> 01:12:16,750
No, you didn't.

703
01:12:18,292 --> 01:12:19,917
You're up early.

704
01:12:20,709 --> 01:12:23,042
Well, I had some thoughts.

705
01:12:25,459 --> 01:12:26,917
I've got a plan.

706
01:12:28,251 --> 01:12:31,001
I don't know if it'll work or not, but...

707
01:12:33,667 --> 01:12:35,209
I'll need your help.

708
01:12:36,126 --> 01:12:37,834
Have I ever denied you anything?

709
01:12:37,959 --> 01:12:39,334
Hey.

710
01:12:44,167 --> 01:12:46,376
Well, when things quiet down,

711
01:12:48,209 --> 01:12:51,042
you're really a very sweet man
to be with.

712
01:12:54,792 --> 01:12:56,500
You had bad dreams.

713
01:12:57,292 --> 01:12:59,167
Talked in your sleep.

714
01:13:00,834 --> 01:13:02,334
What did I say?

715
01:13:03,334 --> 01:13:04,542
Who's Janice?

716
01:13:10,126 --> 01:13:12,251
Was she a volunteer
or a draftee like me?

717
01:13:16,917 --> 01:13:20,959
She was... a friend.

718
01:13:21,917 --> 01:13:23,251
She's dead.

719
01:13:29,292 --> 01:13:31,209
Do I have permission to take a shower?

720
01:13:31,334 --> 01:13:34,792
- You don't have to help, you know.
- No, no. I'll help.

721
01:13:34,917 --> 01:13:36,959
You can always depend
on the old spy-fucker.

722
01:13:43,292 --> 01:13:45,167
OK.

723
01:13:45,292 --> 01:13:46,500
- I'm sorry.
- No.

724
01:13:46,625 --> 01:13:48,334
No, I didn't mean...

725
01:13:50,750 --> 01:13:52,959
I didn't mean to say that.

726
01:13:53,084 --> 01:13:54,750
I'm really sorry.

727
01:13:56,834 --> 01:13:58,667
I'd like to help you.

728
01:14:23,251 --> 01:14:25,500
- Eighteen, isn't that...
- Yes.

729
01:14:28,042 --> 01:14:30,750
AID in ICU, 10-9-8.

730
01:14:39,792 --> 01:14:41,001
Yeah?

731
01:14:41,834 --> 01:14:43,959
Insured package for Katherine Hale.

732
01:14:49,251 --> 01:14:50,709
Could you leave it out on the stoop?

733
01:14:50,834 --> 01:14:53,001
Somebody's got to sign for it.

734
01:14:54,001 --> 01:14:56,167
Well, she's... She's not here.

735
01:14:56,292 --> 01:14:58,126
It's OK, you can sign.

736
01:15:05,875 --> 01:15:09,001
- Yeah?
- Her name on top, yours on the bottom.

737
01:15:09,542 --> 01:15:11,209
All right.

738
01:15:11,334 --> 01:15:13,750
- Wonderful.
- Government pens.

739
01:15:13,875 --> 01:15:15,583
Look, I don't have another pen.

740
01:15:17,667 --> 01:15:19,084
I'll get one.

741
01:16:45,583 --> 01:16:47,959
Don't... Don't... No, no.

742
01:16:48,084 --> 01:16:49,583
No, no. No.

743
01:16:49,709 --> 01:16:52,292
Now listen. You're OK. You're OK.

744
01:16:52,418 --> 01:16:54,459
Now listen to me. You're OK.

745
01:16:54,583 --> 01:16:59,459
Can you get dressed? You're OK.
Can you get dressed? Please, hurry.

746
01:17:43,292 --> 01:17:44,750
'Stella Boutique.'

747
01:17:46,418 --> 01:17:48,292
Extension 1891, please.

748
01:17:49,625 --> 01:17:51,042
'Pardon me?'

749
01:17:53,084 --> 01:17:57,418
Is this 662-3799?

750
01:17:58,084 --> 01:18:00,750
- 'Yes. Who's this?'
- There's no extension 1891?

751
01:18:00,875 --> 01:18:03,709
'Are you kidding? We're lucky
if we have any phone service at all.'

752
01:18:03,834 --> 01:18:05,042
Sorry.

753
01:18:14,542 --> 01:18:16,251
- 'Operator.'
- Operator.

754
01:18:16,834 --> 01:18:20,001
What's the area code
for Washington? DC.

755
01:18:20,126 --> 01:18:21,834
'That's 202.'

756
01:18:24,292 --> 01:18:25,459
Kathy.

757
01:18:32,042 --> 01:18:33,418
'6311.'

758
01:18:35,376 --> 01:18:36,875
CIA? Langley?

759
01:18:37,459 --> 01:18:38,875
'6311.'

760
01:18:40,834 --> 01:18:42,334
Extension 1891.

761
01:18:44,126 --> 01:18:45,667
'1891.'

762
01:18:47,042 --> 01:18:49,126
Let me speak to Mr Wicks.

763
01:18:51,334 --> 01:18:54,126
'He's not here just now.
May I ask who's calling, please?'

764
01:18:54,875 --> 01:18:58,917
- How do you feel? You OK?
- What did you do to those people?

765
01:18:59,459 --> 01:19:02,834
What people?
I don't know who they are anymore.

766
01:19:02,959 --> 01:19:05,459
I file a report,
and a guy in Washington reads it.

767
01:19:05,583 --> 01:19:07,542
He's supposed to read it.
He's my section chief,

768
01:19:07,667 --> 01:19:09,542
and he comes to New York to shoot me.

769
01:19:09,667 --> 01:19:11,625
- Did you know him?
- No.

770
01:19:12,709 --> 01:19:14,750
Did you know the mailman?

771
01:19:15,542 --> 01:19:18,042
No, but the guy in Washington did.

772
01:19:18,667 --> 01:19:20,376
Then you won't know
the next one, either.

773
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:22,126
I'm not gonna wait
for the next one.

774
01:19:22,251 --> 01:19:25,667
- 'Has he gone double or dirty?'
- I don't know, sir.

775
01:19:25,792 --> 01:19:29,667
- 'You think he's still in New York City?'
- I wouldn't be.

776
01:19:29,792 --> 01:19:30,834
Question.

777
01:19:30,959 --> 01:19:34,167
Is there an intelligence network,
undetected by CIA,

778
01:19:34,292 --> 01:19:37,625
linking certain Arabic-speaking countries
with Dutch and Spanish-speaking?

779
01:19:37,750 --> 01:19:40,875
'We're already visible.
Let's not become conspicuous.'

780
01:19:41,001 --> 01:19:44,209
If company agents aren't enough,
use freelance.

781
01:19:44,334 --> 01:19:47,001
Use whatever it requires, but end it.

782
01:19:57,542 --> 01:19:58,834
OK.

783
01:20:09,750 --> 01:20:11,792
Let's get it over with, OK?

784
01:20:14,875 --> 01:20:16,042
Kathy.

785
01:20:18,042 --> 01:20:19,209
Thanks.

786
01:20:41,625 --> 01:20:43,292
Applications here.

787
01:20:47,251 --> 01:20:48,334
OK.

788
01:20:50,209 --> 01:20:53,917
See Mr Addison.
Turn right, first door on your left.

789
01:20:55,167 --> 01:20:56,542
Mr Marcus.

790
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:24,209
- Mr Addison?
- No.

791
01:21:25,792 --> 01:21:28,334
He's in Clearance.
You passed it. It's on your left.

792
01:21:29,292 --> 01:21:33,209
Oh, sorry. Thank you.

793
01:22:29,542 --> 01:22:31,709
Yep. I didn't get the job.

794
01:22:36,376 --> 01:22:37,750
Looks good,

795
01:22:37,875 --> 01:22:41,500
but I have this friend,

796
01:22:41,625 --> 01:22:43,583
and he asked me
to give you a message.

797
01:22:43,709 --> 01:22:46,667
Quote, "Dear Mr Higgins,

798
01:22:46,792 --> 01:22:50,334
"this will introduce a friend of mine,
Sparrow Hawk.

799
01:22:51,418 --> 01:22:56,376
"Please accompany her to
the Nassau Street exit of this place.

800
01:22:56,500 --> 01:22:57,542
"Now."

801
01:23:00,418 --> 01:23:02,292
Personally, I'd do it,

802
01:23:02,418 --> 01:23:07,126
because he has this huge gun,
and he's looking at us right now.

803
01:23:09,084 --> 01:23:11,001
I'll save this for you.

804
01:23:11,834 --> 01:23:13,001
Shall we?

805
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:19,334
To your left, please.

806
01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:42,209
OK, sit up. Sit up!

807
01:23:42,334 --> 01:23:45,042
All the way up.
Back up against the panel.

808
01:23:45,750 --> 01:23:48,709
Take it easy. Take it easy.
I'm not armed.

809
01:23:48,834 --> 01:23:50,750
They could be DF-ing us
if you have a transmitter

810
01:23:50,875 --> 01:23:52,750
hidden somewhere on your clothes.
What's this?

811
01:23:52,875 --> 01:23:55,001
DF, huh?
You do read everything, don't you?

812
01:23:55,126 --> 01:23:58,001
This is no goddamn book. Somebody
or something is rotten in the company.

813
01:23:58,126 --> 01:23:59,625
You never complained till yesterday.

814
01:23:59,750 --> 01:24:01,875
You didn't start killing my friends
till yesterday.

815
01:24:02,001 --> 01:24:04,167
- Who's she?
- Who hit the Lit Society?

816
01:24:04,292 --> 01:24:07,959
We had a big meeting about that.
Your name came up.

817
01:24:08,084 --> 01:24:10,667
Five Continents Imports. Ring a bell?

818
01:24:13,542 --> 01:24:15,500
- Where'd you get that?
- The mailman.

819
01:24:15,625 --> 01:24:16,834
- Mailman?
- The one you sent.

820
01:24:16,959 --> 01:24:20,001
You know, the one with the uniform,
cute little leather pouch, automatic gun.

821
01:24:20,126 --> 01:24:22,667
- We never use mailmen.
- Would you also happen to be familiar

822
01:24:22,792 --> 01:24:25,625
with a very tall gentleman,
about 6'4", blond hair,

823
01:24:25,750 --> 01:24:27,917
strong like a farmer, not American?

824
01:24:28,042 --> 01:24:31,251
Accent. Country, near Germany.
Maybe Alsace-Lorraine?

825
01:24:58,209 --> 01:25:00,583
- Yes?
- 'Was the letter delivered?'

826
01:25:00,709 --> 01:25:03,667
The return receipt has not arrived.

827
01:25:03,792 --> 01:25:06,459
'You should've delivered it yourself.'

828
01:25:06,583 --> 01:25:09,542
A more complicated package
had to be handled.

829
01:25:10,334 --> 01:25:13,042
But I might have
underestimated this one.

830
01:25:13,167 --> 01:25:16,167
'I was told you never make
that kind of mistake.

831
01:25:17,376 --> 01:25:19,500
- 'What will you do?'
- Wait.

832
01:25:20,126 --> 01:25:21,376
'For what?'

833
01:25:22,334 --> 01:25:26,376
People who move
leave word of change-of-address.

834
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:28,875
- I wanna see that report, Turner.
- No, no, Higgins, come on.

835
01:25:29,001 --> 01:25:30,625
- Do you know him?
- Professionally, yes.

836
01:25:30,750 --> 01:25:32,792
- Professionally, he kills people.
- Yes.

837
01:25:33,376 --> 01:25:34,418
Yes.

838
01:25:34,542 --> 01:25:36,042
He works for the company?

839
01:25:36,167 --> 01:25:38,292
He did once. He's a contract agent.

840
01:25:38,418 --> 01:25:40,542
- Contract agent.
- Freelance.

841
01:25:41,583 --> 01:25:42,750
Where did you see him?

842
01:25:45,542 --> 01:25:47,042
Uh-uh.

843
01:25:47,792 --> 01:25:49,667
- It would help if I knew.
- Who would it help?

844
01:25:50,667 --> 01:25:52,251
- Who'd hire him now?
- Anybody.

845
01:25:52,376 --> 01:25:53,500
Terrific answer!

846
01:25:55,209 --> 01:25:57,418
- I wouldn't accept it, either.
- What's his name?

847
01:25:57,542 --> 01:26:01,126
- When I knew him, Joubert.
- Come on, Higgins. Who'd hire him?

848
01:26:01,251 --> 01:26:03,042
You don't look up Joubert
in the Yellow Pages.

849
01:26:03,167 --> 01:26:04,292
That's right.

850
01:26:05,167 --> 01:26:07,792
It would have to be
somebody in the community.

851
01:26:07,917 --> 01:26:10,084
- Community?
- Intelligence field.

852
01:26:10,209 --> 01:26:14,251
Community! Jesus, you guys are
kind to yourselves. Community.

853
01:26:16,167 --> 01:26:17,709
I want to see that report, Turner.

854
01:26:17,834 --> 01:26:20,126
That report was sent to headquarters
and disappeared.

855
01:26:20,834 --> 01:26:23,500
- Who read it?
- You mean besides Wicks?

856
01:26:25,418 --> 01:26:26,834
You tell me.

857
01:26:30,583 --> 01:26:33,334
I pick up traces of what
I think's an intelligence network

858
01:26:33,459 --> 01:26:35,667
the company doesn't know about,

859
01:26:35,792 --> 01:26:37,126
and I report it.

860
01:26:37,251 --> 01:26:40,917
Now, why is that going to
make anybody mad, Higgins?

861
01:26:41,042 --> 01:26:43,583
Unless it was the company's network
and you didn't want it blown,

862
01:26:43,709 --> 01:26:45,750
not even to your own guys.

863
01:26:46,792 --> 01:26:49,583
Now, somebody is lying, Higgins.

864
01:26:49,709 --> 01:26:50,917
Come on.

865
01:26:51,959 --> 01:26:53,917
Why is everybody so shy?

866
01:26:55,334 --> 01:26:56,709
I'm not shy.

867
01:26:59,126 --> 01:27:01,542
I don't know. That's what worries me.

868
01:27:03,418 --> 01:27:05,750
- I don't know.
- Ask Wicks.

869
01:27:05,875 --> 01:27:07,126
Wicks died.

870
01:27:11,292 --> 01:27:14,792
Someone yanked him off the life
support system at Gouverneur Hospital.

871
01:27:25,583 --> 01:27:27,084
Get me in, Higgins.

872
01:27:29,334 --> 01:27:32,042
What good would that do
if you're right, and they are inside?

873
01:27:32,167 --> 01:27:34,126
What good would it do to bring you in?

874
01:27:36,418 --> 01:27:37,875
What am I supposed to do?

875
01:27:40,834 --> 01:27:42,042
I'm sorry.

876
01:27:43,542 --> 01:27:44,875
You're sorry?

877
01:27:52,251 --> 01:27:53,709
You're sorry.

878
01:27:57,542 --> 01:27:58,834
Oh, I get it.

879
01:28:00,750 --> 01:28:03,292
I get it. You expect me to draw fire,

880
01:28:04,334 --> 01:28:06,251
like one of those penny arcade bears

881
01:28:06,376 --> 01:28:08,542
that parades back and forth,
waiting for somebody,

882
01:28:08,667 --> 01:28:10,750
somebody very good,
just to take another shot.

883
01:28:10,875 --> 01:28:12,209
And you're just gonna hang around

884
01:28:12,334 --> 01:28:14,334
and pick him up before he does it,
or just after?

885
01:28:14,459 --> 01:28:16,126
I'm gonna try
and find out what's going on.

886
01:28:16,251 --> 01:28:18,709
- I'm gonna cross-check all those names.
- Nice talking to you, Higgins.

887
01:28:18,834 --> 01:28:20,251
- Now wait a minute.
- Have a nice day.

888
01:28:20,376 --> 01:28:22,292
Where are you going?
Where will I find you?

889
01:28:22,418 --> 01:28:23,625
I'll find you.

890
01:28:32,583 --> 01:28:34,500
Do you trust him?

891
01:28:34,625 --> 01:28:36,209
Trust.

892
01:28:36,334 --> 01:28:38,209
Does he trust you?

893
01:28:38,334 --> 01:28:40,542
He's in the suspicion business.
He can't trust anybody.

894
01:28:40,667 --> 01:28:43,167
But they all are. How could
anybody sneak in and fool them?

895
01:28:43,292 --> 01:28:45,126
Maybe nobody did.

896
01:28:45,251 --> 01:28:48,542
- Then...
- Maybe there's another CIA

897
01:28:49,917 --> 01:28:51,542
inside the CIA.

898
01:29:15,376 --> 01:29:16,583
Hey, Sal.

899
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:20,209
The lights went off.
Come on over here.

900
01:29:22,042 --> 01:29:23,875
The generator went off.

901
01:29:27,418 --> 01:29:30,334
- It's a hotel room.
- What hotel?

902
01:29:30,459 --> 01:29:33,667
There's no tag.
It's Room 819, City of New York.

903
01:29:33,792 --> 01:29:36,042
There's a code number cut in the edge.

904
01:29:36,167 --> 01:29:37,750
You in the trade?

905
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:41,709
- I read about it in a story.
- Was the story about locksmiths?

906
01:29:41,834 --> 01:29:45,542
It's the lock manufacturer's code.
He can give you the name of the hotel.

907
01:29:45,667 --> 01:29:48,750
Look, I don't want to read
about you in the paper, sonny.

908
01:29:48,875 --> 01:29:50,792
Will you make the call?

909
01:30:28,792 --> 01:30:29,959
Yes?

910
01:30:31,667 --> 01:30:33,459
I'm doing a survey.

911
01:30:34,542 --> 01:30:37,500
Do you believe the Condor is
really an endangered species?

912
01:30:58,959 --> 01:31:01,418
'Your room number, please.'
'819.'

913
01:31:07,042 --> 01:31:08,459
- 'Hello?'
- Yes.

914
01:31:08,583 --> 01:31:11,084
- I just had an interesting call.
- 'Who is this?'

915
01:31:11,209 --> 01:31:14,542
In reference to an all but extinct bird,
the condor.

916
01:31:14,667 --> 01:31:17,875
'Have you had such a call?'
'You're a fool to call me here.'

917
01:31:18,001 --> 01:31:21,126
- You had no such call?
- 'No.'

918
01:31:21,251 --> 01:31:23,292
Must have been the Audubon Society.

919
01:31:23,418 --> 01:31:25,792
I assume they're still located
in New York City.

920
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:33,334
'Langley Computer.
State your program at the tone.'

921
01:31:33,459 --> 01:31:35,459
G.

922
01:31:36,209 --> 01:31:37,792
Carriage return.

923
01:31:38,709 --> 01:31:40,209
TRS. Tone.

924
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:43,167
Symbol for number.

925
01:31:44,334 --> 01:31:46,500
'Computer is ready.'

926
01:31:55,834 --> 01:32:00,292
'That number is 202-227-0098.'

927
01:32:17,292 --> 01:32:20,875
- 'CNA, Mrs Coleman speaking.'
- This is Harold Thomas, Mrs Coleman.

928
01:32:21,001 --> 01:32:29,625
Customer service,
requesting a CNA on 202-227-0098.

929
01:32:29,750 --> 01:32:31,542
'One moment, please.

930
01:32:34,126 --> 01:32:37,001
'That would be a Mr Leonard Atwood.

931
01:32:37,126 --> 01:32:40,542
'365 Mackenzie Place,
Chevy Chase, Maryland.

932
01:33:17,042 --> 01:33:18,334
All right.

933
01:33:18,459 --> 01:33:22,251
Cross-check this tape against Wicks
and hold any intersects.

934
01:33:33,792 --> 01:33:35,042
Hat size.

935
01:33:41,418 --> 01:33:42,667
"Lucifer."

936
01:33:43,709 --> 01:33:45,709
All right, run Lucifer.

937
01:33:45,834 --> 01:33:47,126
Coming up.

938
01:34:08,792 --> 01:34:12,042
I'll be damned. I'll be damned.

939
01:35:04,334 --> 01:35:08,542
- This is the Major.
- 'Condor. Find me Higgins.'

940
01:35:09,042 --> 01:35:11,625
Routing you, Condor. Stand by.

941
01:35:17,167 --> 01:35:18,709
Hello, Condor.

942
01:35:18,834 --> 01:35:22,709
- The Holiday Inn, 57th Street.
- 'Is that where you are now?'

943
01:35:22,834 --> 01:35:26,709
Room 819. If you move it, you'll find
the Alsatian gentleman we spoke of.

944
01:35:26,834 --> 01:35:28,251
'Where are you, Condor?'

945
01:35:29,042 --> 01:35:32,834
- Where are you?
- Quiet down.

946
01:35:34,251 --> 01:35:35,376
Hey, Higgins?

947
01:35:35,500 --> 01:35:37,792
Yeah, I'm right here.

948
01:35:39,126 --> 01:35:40,625
Who is Leonard Atwood?

949
01:35:50,334 --> 01:35:51,792
Where are you, Higgins?

950
01:35:56,834 --> 01:35:58,667
Ain't we pals anymore?

951
01:36:02,084 --> 01:36:04,334
- Something?
- Major?

952
01:36:04,459 --> 01:36:06,959
- Got him.
- Let me see that.

953
01:36:10,001 --> 01:36:11,750
What's he doing in Brooklyn?

954
01:36:12,334 --> 01:36:13,959
Condor.

955
01:36:14,084 --> 01:36:16,542
- We can get a unit...
- Wait.

956
01:36:24,418 --> 01:36:28,500
- What's going on, Major?
- Son of a bitch wired together 50 phones.

957
01:36:28,625 --> 01:36:29,667
What?

958
01:36:29,792 --> 01:36:32,917
Everybody in Brooklyn's
talking to each other.

959
01:36:50,667 --> 01:36:53,834
- I didn't know you smoked.
- I quit three years ago.

960
01:36:56,209 --> 01:36:59,042
- You're so pale.
- It's the light in here.

961
01:37:03,875 --> 01:37:05,959
What are you gonna do there?

962
01:37:06,959 --> 01:37:09,042
- See a guy.
- More secrets.

963
01:37:09,792 --> 01:37:12,001
Like those pictures you hide.

964
01:37:13,209 --> 01:37:14,334
Yes.

965
01:37:15,542 --> 01:37:18,709
Someday, I'd like to show them to you,

966
01:37:20,334 --> 01:37:22,334
if you live through this.

967
01:37:23,917 --> 01:37:26,292
You could drive me to Washington.

968
01:37:32,418 --> 01:37:34,167
No, I couldn't.

969
01:37:37,792 --> 01:37:42,376
You...
You have a lot of very fine qualities,

970
01:37:44,709 --> 01:37:47,667
- but...
- What fine qualities?

971
01:37:56,334 --> 01:37:58,084
You have good eyes.

972
01:37:59,959 --> 01:38:05,834
Not kind, but they don't lie,
and they don't look away much,

973
01:38:07,126 --> 01:38:09,334
and they don't miss anything.

974
01:38:11,418 --> 01:38:13,542
I could use eyes like that.

975
01:38:15,875 --> 01:38:17,667
But you're overdue in Vermont.

976
01:38:24,667 --> 01:38:26,418
Is he a tough guy?

977
01:38:27,875 --> 01:38:29,542
He's pretty tough.

978
01:38:31,459 --> 01:38:33,084
What will he do?

979
01:38:34,209 --> 01:38:36,042
Understand, probably.

980
01:38:38,542 --> 01:38:41,418
Boy, that is tough.

981
01:38:41,917 --> 01:38:43,792
'Last call, track six,

982
01:38:43,917 --> 01:38:48,251
'Newark connection passengers destined
for Washington DC, all aboard.'

983
01:38:51,542 --> 01:38:54,042
Kathy, I need time.

984
01:38:55,917 --> 01:38:57,875
Eight hours or so, that's all.
Just till noon.

985
01:38:58,001 --> 01:38:59,917
To do what I have to do.

986
01:39:01,001 --> 01:39:04,625
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- No.

987
01:39:04,750 --> 01:39:06,625
Are you going right to Vermont?

988
01:39:08,875 --> 01:39:10,167
Yes.

989
01:39:11,084 --> 01:39:14,292
What I mean is don't call anyone.

990
01:39:16,376 --> 01:39:18,084
Don't stop, please.

991
01:39:19,667 --> 01:39:21,750
Don't tell anyone about...

992
01:39:31,418 --> 01:39:32,917
- Jesus.
- What?

993
01:39:33,875 --> 01:39:35,042
Jesus.

994
01:39:35,542 --> 01:39:37,084
I... I didn't...

995
01:39:37,209 --> 01:39:38,709
'All aboard!'

996
01:39:40,167 --> 01:39:41,209
Hey.

997
01:39:42,875 --> 01:39:46,917
- You take care of yourself.
- I'll do my best.

998
01:39:48,917 --> 01:39:50,376
Do your best.

999
01:39:59,750 --> 01:40:02,251
Why aren't you further along,
Mr Higgins?

1000
01:40:02,376 --> 01:40:04,042
You mean
with the company, sir?

1001
01:40:04,167 --> 01:40:06,042
You seem perfect for it.

1002
01:40:08,917 --> 01:40:11,542
Are you perfect for it, Mr Higgins?

1003
01:40:13,126 --> 01:40:14,667
I have tried to be, sir.

1004
01:40:15,500 --> 01:40:18,418
- You were recruited out of school?
- No, sir.

1005
01:40:18,542 --> 01:40:20,709
Company interviewed
a few of us in Korea.

1006
01:40:21,542 --> 01:40:24,834
You served with Colonel Donovan
in the OSS, didn't you, sir?

1007
01:40:24,959 --> 01:40:28,709
I sailed the Adriatic
with a movie star at the helm.

1008
01:40:30,542 --> 01:40:34,292
Doesn't seem like much of a war now,
but it was.

1009
01:40:35,709 --> 01:40:38,042
I go even further back than that.

1010
01:40:38,167 --> 01:40:41,875
Ten years after the Great War,
as we used to call it,

1011
01:40:43,292 --> 01:40:45,667
before we knew enough
to number them.

1012
01:40:46,792 --> 01:40:49,709
- You miss that kind of action, sir?
- No.

1013
01:40:51,167 --> 01:40:53,376
I miss that kind of clarity.

1014
01:40:57,875 --> 01:40:58,917
Yes?

1015
01:41:01,418 --> 01:41:02,667
Thank you.

1016
01:41:04,500 --> 01:41:06,750
He's being held at New York Center.

1017
01:41:13,542 --> 01:41:16,917
Mr Higgins, you do understand
the company's position.

1018
01:41:19,750 --> 01:41:23,209
There's nothing in the way
of your doing this, is there?

1019
01:42:05,917 --> 01:42:09,126
What is this? What's going on?

1020
01:42:28,001 --> 01:42:29,542
Who are you?

1021
01:42:39,001 --> 01:42:40,418
Who are you?

1022
01:42:41,418 --> 01:42:43,376
What are you doing here?

1023
01:42:44,750 --> 01:42:46,167
I'm Condor.

1024
01:42:50,126 --> 01:42:51,625
Sit down.

1025
01:42:53,292 --> 01:42:55,376
What do you do for a living?

1026
01:42:55,959 --> 01:42:58,292
- Don't be ridiculous.
- No.

1027
01:42:59,542 --> 01:43:03,334
What do you do exactly?

1028
01:43:06,209 --> 01:43:08,459
Deputy Director of Operations.

1029
01:43:10,209 --> 01:43:11,583
What section?

1030
01:43:12,209 --> 01:43:13,459
Middle East.

1031
01:43:16,001 --> 01:43:18,001
What are you working on?

1032
01:43:20,542 --> 01:43:22,251
What are you doing?

1033
01:43:23,917 --> 01:43:27,959
What's the secret worth murdering
everybody at the ALHS house?

1034
01:43:28,667 --> 01:43:31,209
- There's no secret.
- Wicks showed you my report.

1035
01:43:31,334 --> 01:43:33,042
What report? Yes.

1036
01:43:38,917 --> 01:43:41,084
It was your network I turned up.

1037
01:43:44,292 --> 01:43:45,542
Doing what?

1038
01:43:47,251 --> 01:43:48,583
Doing what?

1039
01:43:50,251 --> 01:43:53,251
What does Operations care
about a bunch of goddamn books?

1040
01:43:53,376 --> 01:43:54,917
A book in Dutch.

1041
01:43:56,583 --> 01:43:58,459
A book out of Venezuela.

1042
01:43:58,583 --> 01:44:00,875
- Mystery stories in Arabic.
- Wait.

1043
01:44:01,001 --> 01:44:03,209
What the hell is so important about...

1044
01:44:09,292 --> 01:44:10,583
Oil fields.

1045
01:44:15,209 --> 01:44:16,334
Oil.

1046
01:44:28,834 --> 01:44:30,583
That's it, isn't it?

1047
01:44:35,792 --> 01:44:38,292
This whole damn thing was about oil.

1048
01:44:40,418 --> 01:44:42,376
Wasn't it? Wasn't it?

1049
01:44:43,959 --> 01:44:45,376
Yes, it was.

1050
01:44:47,084 --> 01:44:48,459
Don't turn for a moment.

1051
01:44:49,709 --> 01:44:51,959
Put your thumb in front of the hammer.

1052
01:44:57,917 --> 01:44:59,500
Release it slowly.

1053
01:45:03,376 --> 01:45:05,209
Set down the gun on the desk.

1054
01:45:11,542 --> 01:45:13,292
And don't move.

1055
01:45:24,959 --> 01:45:26,167
Back up.

1056
01:45:32,792 --> 01:45:35,042
You were quite good, Condor, until this.

1057
01:45:38,667 --> 01:45:39,917
This move was predictable.

1058
01:45:43,376 --> 01:45:44,542
Hey!

1059
01:46:05,667 --> 01:46:06,875
What?

1060
01:46:08,583 --> 01:46:09,750
What?

1061
01:46:10,376 --> 01:46:12,376
Did you touch anything
except the chair?

1062
01:46:14,709 --> 01:46:16,750
You're working for the company again.

1063
01:46:17,709 --> 01:46:20,459
The desk? The lamp?

1064
01:46:22,001 --> 01:46:24,042
Jesus. They took you back.

1065
01:46:25,750 --> 01:46:28,583
Just for this. For Atwood.

1066
01:46:30,500 --> 01:46:33,959
How... He's with the company. Why?

1067
01:46:34,959 --> 01:46:36,625
I don't interest myself in why.

1068
01:46:36,750 --> 01:46:42,542
I think more often in terms of when,
sometimes where, always how much.

1069
01:46:44,084 --> 01:46:47,251
I suspect he was about to
become an embarrassment,

1070
01:46:48,917 --> 01:46:50,042
as you are.

1071
01:46:58,084 --> 01:46:59,459
So you're not finished.

1072
01:46:59,583 --> 01:47:00,875
Pardon?

1073
01:47:01,001 --> 01:47:04,750
Oh, no. I have no arrangement
with the company concerning you.

1074
01:47:04,875 --> 01:47:08,292
They didn't know you'd be here.
I knew you'd be here.

1075
01:47:13,459 --> 01:47:15,209
But didn't you send the mailman?

1076
01:47:16,209 --> 01:47:19,126
That was a business arrangement
with Atwood.

1077
01:47:19,251 --> 01:47:20,834
But you see...

1078
01:47:28,126 --> 01:47:29,500
Come on.

1079
01:47:37,418 --> 01:47:38,750
Come.

1080
01:48:12,542 --> 01:48:14,459
Tell me about the girl.

1081
01:48:18,001 --> 01:48:19,750
What about the girl?

1082
01:48:21,209 --> 01:48:23,625
She was chosen how?

1083
01:48:24,959 --> 01:48:26,292
By age?

1084
01:48:26,418 --> 01:48:30,418
- Her car? Appearance?
- At random.

1085
01:48:31,834 --> 01:48:34,418
- Chance.
- Really?

1086
01:48:38,084 --> 01:48:39,667
Can I drop you?

1087
01:48:45,500 --> 01:48:47,834
I'd like to go back to New York.

1088
01:48:50,834 --> 01:48:52,667
You have not much future there.

1089
01:48:59,001 --> 01:49:01,167
It would happen this way.

1090
01:49:02,126 --> 01:49:03,750
You may be walking.

1091
01:49:05,334 --> 01:49:08,542
Maybe the first sunny day
of the spring,

1092
01:49:09,750 --> 01:49:12,126
and a car will slow beside you,

1093
01:49:12,959 --> 01:49:14,209
and the door will open,

1094
01:49:14,334 --> 01:49:17,376
and someone you know,
maybe even trust,

1095
01:49:18,126 --> 01:49:19,792
will get out of the car.

1096
01:49:21,834 --> 01:49:24,959
And he will smile, a becoming smile,

1097
01:49:27,167 --> 01:49:29,917
but he will leave open
the door of the car

1098
01:49:31,792 --> 01:49:34,126
and offer to give you a lift.

1099
01:49:40,167 --> 01:49:42,667
You seem to understand it all so well.

1100
01:49:45,583 --> 01:49:47,292
What would you suggest?

1101
01:49:48,500 --> 01:49:50,542
Personally, I prefer Europe.

1102
01:49:51,209 --> 01:49:53,583
- Europe?
- Yes.

1103
01:49:54,167 --> 01:49:58,542
Well, the fact is,
what I do is not a bad occupation.

1104
01:49:59,917 --> 01:50:01,875
Someone is always willing to pay.

1105
01:50:06,667 --> 01:50:11,334
I would find it... tiring.

1106
01:50:11,459 --> 01:50:15,625
Oh, no. It's quite restful.
It's almost peaceful.

1107
01:50:15,750 --> 01:50:18,750
No need to believe in either side
or any side.

1108
01:50:19,667 --> 01:50:21,209
There is no cause.

1109
01:50:21,750 --> 01:50:23,667
There's only yourself.

1110
01:50:24,583 --> 01:50:26,875
The belief is in your own precision.

1111
01:50:32,959 --> 01:50:35,709
I was born in the United States, Joubert.

1112
01:50:37,959 --> 01:50:40,334
I miss it when I'm away too long.

1113
01:50:41,376 --> 01:50:42,750
A pity.

1114
01:50:45,750 --> 01:50:47,376
I don't think so.

1115
01:50:51,126 --> 01:50:53,500
Is it any trouble to drop me
at the Union Station?

1116
01:50:53,625 --> 01:50:57,209
Oh, no. It would be my pleasure.

1117
01:51:05,792 --> 01:51:07,126
For that day.

1118
01:51:27,583 --> 01:51:28,834
Higgins!

1119
01:51:32,167 --> 01:51:33,459
Higgins!

1120
01:51:51,167 --> 01:51:53,709
Turner. Why'd you call so late?
We were worried about you.

1121
01:51:53,834 --> 01:51:55,750
Likewise. The car for me?

1122
01:51:55,875 --> 01:51:59,001
Yeah, it's all right. It's safe.
You have a few hours of debriefing.

1123
01:51:59,126 --> 01:52:01,001
- Hey, Higgins?
- Yeah?

1124
01:52:02,459 --> 01:52:08,292
Let's say for the purposes of argument,
I had a .45 in one of my pockets.

1125
01:52:10,376 --> 01:52:13,001
And I wanted you to take a walk
with me. You'd do it, right?

1126
01:52:14,875 --> 01:52:16,209
Which way?

1127
01:52:17,251 --> 01:52:18,376
West.

1128
01:52:19,251 --> 01:52:20,376
Slowly.

1129
01:52:20,500 --> 01:52:23,583
Stay in front of me about three
or four steps.

1130
01:52:32,042 --> 01:52:33,792
Where are we going?

1131
01:52:35,167 --> 01:52:37,167
Wave them on ahead, Higgins.

1132
01:52:47,209 --> 01:52:50,001
Do we have plans
to invade the Middle East?

1133
01:52:50,542 --> 01:52:52,834
- Are you crazy?
- Am I?

1134
01:52:52,959 --> 01:52:55,001
- Look, Turner...
- Do we have plans?

1135
01:52:55,126 --> 01:52:57,418
No. Absolutely not.

1136
01:52:57,542 --> 01:53:00,334
We have games. That's all.

1137
01:53:00,459 --> 01:53:02,500
We play games. What if?

1138
01:53:03,209 --> 01:53:05,542
How many men?
What would it take?

1139
01:53:06,209 --> 01:53:09,292
Is there a cheaper way
to destabilise a regime?

1140
01:53:09,418 --> 01:53:13,084
- That's what we're paid to do.
- Walk on.

1141
01:53:13,209 --> 01:53:14,542
Go on.

1142
01:53:19,084 --> 01:53:21,542
So Atwood just took
the games too seriously.

1143
01:53:21,667 --> 01:53:24,251
He was really going to do it, wasn't he?

1144
01:53:24,376 --> 01:53:26,418
A renegade operation.

1145
01:53:26,542 --> 01:53:29,042
Atwood knew 54/12
would never authorise it.

1146
01:53:29,167 --> 01:53:31,126
There was no way,
not with the heat on the company.

1147
01:53:31,251 --> 01:53:32,750
What if there hadn't been any heat?

1148
01:53:32,875 --> 01:53:36,126
Supposing I hadn't stumbled
on their plan, say nobody had.

1149
01:53:37,251 --> 01:53:39,292
Different ballgame.

1150
01:53:39,418 --> 01:53:42,251
Fact is,
there was nothing wrong with the plan.

1151
01:53:42,376 --> 01:53:45,709
The plan was all right.
The plan would've worked.

1152
01:53:47,459 --> 01:53:49,792
Boy, what is it with you people?

1153
01:53:49,917 --> 01:53:53,418
Do you think not getting caught on a lie
is the same thing as telling the truth?

1154
01:53:53,542 --> 01:53:56,459
No. It's simple economics.

1155
01:53:56,583 --> 01:53:58,459
Today it's oil, right?

1156
01:53:58,583 --> 01:54:03,334
In 10 or 15 years, food, plutonium,
and maybe even sooner.

1157
01:54:03,459 --> 01:54:06,709
Now, what do you think the people
are going to want us to do then?

1158
01:54:07,875 --> 01:54:08,917
Ask them.

1159
01:54:09,042 --> 01:54:12,334
Not now. Then.
Ask them when they're running out.

1160
01:54:12,459 --> 01:54:15,292
Ask them when there's no heat
in their homes, and they're cold.

1161
01:54:15,418 --> 01:54:17,292
Ask them when their engines stop.

1162
01:54:17,418 --> 01:54:20,875
Ask them when people who've never
known hunger start going hungry.

1163
01:54:21,001 --> 01:54:22,583
You want to know something?

1164
01:54:22,709 --> 01:54:26,167
They won't want us to ask them.
They'll just want us to get it for them.

1165
01:54:27,542 --> 01:54:31,418
Boy, have you found a home?

1166
01:54:33,583 --> 01:54:35,583
Seven people killed, Higgins.

1167
01:54:35,709 --> 01:54:38,625
- The company didn't order it.
- Atwood did.

1168
01:54:38,750 --> 01:54:40,126
Atwood did.

1169
01:54:40,959 --> 01:54:44,042
And who the hell is Atwood?
He's you. He's all you guys.

1170
01:54:44,167 --> 01:54:45,959
Seven people killed!

1171
01:54:46,084 --> 01:54:50,001
- And you play fucking games!
- Right.

1172
01:54:50,126 --> 01:54:52,583
And the other side does, too.

1173
01:54:52,709 --> 01:54:55,376
That's why we can't let you stay outside.

1174
01:54:55,500 --> 01:54:58,959
Well, go on home, Higgins.
Go on. They've got it.

1175
01:55:00,542 --> 01:55:02,126
- What?
- You know where we are.

1176
01:55:02,251 --> 01:55:05,792
Just look around. They've got it.
That's where they ship from.

1177
01:55:05,917 --> 01:55:07,750
They've got all of it.

1178
01:55:17,834 --> 01:55:21,750
- What? What did you do?
- I told them a story.

1179
01:55:21,875 --> 01:55:25,542
You play games,
I told them a story.

1180
01:55:33,750 --> 01:55:35,126
Oh you...

1181
01:55:35,959 --> 01:55:42,251
You poor, dumb son of a bitch.
You done more damage than you know.

1182
01:55:44,209 --> 01:55:45,709
I hope so.

1183
01:55:54,126 --> 01:55:56,292
You're about to be a very lonely man.

1184
01:56:00,376 --> 01:56:02,042
It didn't have to end this way.

1185
01:56:02,583 --> 01:56:04,209
Of course it did.

1186
01:56:06,542 --> 01:56:08,042
Hey, Turner.

1187
01:56:10,084 --> 01:56:11,500
How do you know they'll print it?

1188
01:56:14,251 --> 01:56:15,542
You can take a walk,

1189
01:56:16,959 --> 01:56:19,292
but how far if they don't print it?

1190
01:56:20,001 --> 01:56:21,459
They'll print it.

1191
01:56:23,167 --> 01:56:24,709
How do you know?
