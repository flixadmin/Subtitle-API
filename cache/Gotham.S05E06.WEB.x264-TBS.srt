1
00:00:00,922 --> 00:00:02,773
- <i>Previously on</i> Gotham...
- Everybody,

2
00:00:02,828 --> 00:00:05,554
raise your glasses to the killer

3
00:00:05,625 --> 00:00:08,760
of Jeremiah Valeska.

4
00:00:08,812 --> 00:00:11,860
- A lead on a guy selling RPGs.
- Get out of here, Barbara.

5
00:00:25,537 --> 00:00:26,848
Eduardo?

6
00:00:26,924 --> 00:00:29,659
Nice shot, right?

7
00:00:29,867 --> 00:00:31,535
Tell me what you did!

8
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:33,326
I put a chip in your brain.

9
00:00:33,394 --> 00:00:34,394
Better talk, now.

10
00:00:34,462 --> 00:00:36,096
A contract came along.

11
00:00:36,163 --> 00:00:38,131
A contract from who?

12
00:00:39,533 --> 00:00:42,202
Walker wants Ed Nygma taken out now.

13
00:00:42,269 --> 00:00:43,414
Walker was behind this?

14
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:45,945
She's been controlling Nygma
the whole time?

15
00:00:49,977 --> 00:00:51,444
Ouch.

16
00:00:51,512 --> 00:00:52,946
Stitches still sore, huh?

17
00:00:53,013 --> 00:00:56,149
I told you I had to let
Selina thrust the knife

18
00:00:56,217 --> 00:00:58,785
into my flesh at least once.

19
00:00:58,853 --> 00:01:00,956
You know Jim Gordon.

20
00:01:01,011 --> 00:01:02,122
You know this city.

21
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:03,957
Find him. And kill him.

22
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:51,788
Your chances of survival
are astronomically low, James.

23
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:56,663
Continuing to run is ill-advised.

24

25
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:05,612
Hope you're well rested, Edward.

26
00:03:06,241 --> 00:03:09,444
We have a lot of work ahead of us.

27
00:03:12,715 --> 00:03:14,821
Edward?

28
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:20,894
Edward, what is it?

29
00:03:21,456 --> 00:03:23,296
Is someone down there, boy?

30
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,425

Ooh, pretty, pretty.

35
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:39,832
I'll call you Charlotte.

36
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,336
Ooh, you're a handsome devil.
What's your name?

37
00:03:43,404 --> 00:03:45,872
Oswald Cobblepot.

38
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:48,760
But I'm guessing you already knew that.

39
00:03:57,615 --> 00:03:58,949
Stop!

40
00:04:03,754 --> 00:04:06,824
Penguin. Didn't think
you'd miss a couple things.

41
00:04:06,894 --> 00:04:08,528
Couple things go missing all the time.

42
00:04:08,595 --> 00:04:10,563
How did you know about this place?

43
00:04:10,631 --> 00:04:13,004
All of the thieves I used are dead.

44
00:04:13,074 --> 00:04:14,887
Yep, yep.

45
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:16,346
Was on a job.

46
00:04:16,433 --> 00:04:18,150
Someone got there first.

47
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,745
Followed them back here.

48
00:04:19,808 --> 00:04:21,761
Saw you. Bang, bang.

49
00:04:23,065 --> 00:04:25,431
Then you know what is in store.

50
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:29,268
I do hope whatever you came
here for was worth your life.

51
00:04:33,299 --> 00:04:35,099
The Russifer Diamond.

52
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:38,878
Not Russifer. Charlotte.

53
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:41,214
What's in your other hand?

54
00:04:44,063 --> 00:04:46,219
Wait, how did you...

55
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:53,329
Bye-bye.

56
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:06,575
Who the hell was that?

57
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:10,989
Oh, God...

58
00:05:11,052 --> 00:05:12,739
Oh!

59
00:05:12,793 --> 00:05:15,528
Oh, God. It happened again, didn't it?

60
00:05:15,595 --> 00:05:17,163
What did I do?

61
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,664
You tried to kill me.

62
00:05:18,732 --> 00:05:21,582
Oh. Is that all?

63
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,289
I need answers, Ed.

64
00:05:23,357 --> 00:05:25,879
I know Walker gave the orders
to destroy Haven

65
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,848
and the supply helicopter.

66
00:05:27,934 --> 00:05:29,362
What is she planning next?

67
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,097
I don't know.

68
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:35,851
Jim, I don't remember anything
once I go under.

69
00:05:35,925 --> 00:05:38,559
You're bleeding.

70
00:05:40,724 --> 00:05:43,724
You have to let me go.
I'm not responsible for this.

71
00:05:44,264 --> 00:05:45,978
That chip in your head
could be evidence.

72
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:48,045
So unless you want me to rip it out,

73
00:05:48,107 --> 00:05:50,592
- you're coming with me.
- Okay.

74
00:06:03,234 --> 00:06:04,668
Bruce.

75
00:06:04,761 --> 00:06:06,866
There you are.

76
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:09,535
So, go on, then.

77
00:06:10,324 --> 00:06:11,694
How'd it go with Selina?

78
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:14,051
Oh, dear.

79
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,592
Well, I am sorry, Master Bruce,
but perhaps it's for the best.

80
00:06:16,654 --> 00:06:19,882
Maybe. That's not why I called
you here. You see this?

81
00:06:19,933 --> 00:06:22,421
Yeah, I know, right?
Looks like Captain Gordon's

82
00:06:22,489 --> 00:06:25,144
finally getting the help
this city so desperately needs.

83
00:06:25,212 --> 00:06:26,846
Is he?

84
00:06:26,913 --> 00:06:29,181
What the people desperately
need is food and medicine.

85
00:06:29,249 --> 00:06:30,716
Not just more guns.

86
00:06:31,985 --> 00:06:33,686
What is it?

87
00:06:34,211 --> 00:06:38,664
No, it's just this unit.
Their motto is "Born of Blood."

88
00:06:41,097 --> 00:06:43,396
You know them?

89
00:06:43,463 --> 00:06:44,806
Yeah, by reputation only.

90
00:06:44,831 --> 00:06:46,132
They're a horrible bunch of bastards.

91
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:49,602
They specialize in military
coups, assassinations.

92
00:06:49,669 --> 00:06:50,836
They're certainly not the vanguard

93
00:06:50,904 --> 00:06:53,211
for humanitarian relief.

94
00:06:55,008 --> 00:06:56,142
Excuse me.

95
00:06:56,209 --> 00:06:59,245
When's the supply
shipment gonna be here?

96
00:06:59,312 --> 00:07:00,613
Supplies?

97
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,415
These people are desperate for food,

98
00:07:02,482 --> 00:07:04,750
clean water, medicine.

99
00:07:04,818 --> 00:07:07,277
Oh, yeah. It's on its way.

100
00:07:08,935 --> 00:07:11,837
Where's Captain Gordon?

101
00:07:13,226 --> 00:07:14,960
We lost sight of Gordon.

102
00:07:15,028 --> 00:07:17,830
But don't worry. Eduardo's out
there looking for him right now.

103
00:07:17,898 --> 00:07:20,833
Unless you know where we might find him?

104
00:07:20,901 --> 00:07:23,936
Logically, he'd come here.

105
00:07:24,004 --> 00:07:26,405
Unless there's some reason he can't.

106
00:07:27,556 --> 00:07:29,900
Tell you what, kiddo.

107
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,931
I'm gonna find you and your
friend a quiet place in the back

108
00:07:31,956 --> 00:07:32,979
where you can wait for Gordon.

109
00:07:33,004 --> 00:07:34,046
Ah, don't you worry about it, mate.

110
00:07:34,114 --> 00:07:35,581
We'll just catch up with him later.

111
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,229
I insist.

112
00:07:54,386 --> 00:07:56,302
We need to find Jim.

113
00:07:56,565 --> 00:07:59,620
So the government is behind
Haven and the supply helicopter,

114
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,841
and they did it with a chip
in this one's head?

115
00:08:01,931 --> 00:08:04,276
Is that really the craziest thing
you've ever heard, Barbara?

116
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,751
Bruce hit me up on the radio

117
00:08:05,796 --> 00:08:07,029
a little while ago, looking for you.

118
00:08:07,126 --> 00:08:09,483
Said things are amiss in the GCPD.

119
00:08:09,513 --> 00:08:11,784
I'll reach out, see if we
can meet up somewhere safe.

120
00:08:11,852 --> 00:08:14,249
Can you pull in some of your
people, see if they can help?

121
00:08:14,296 --> 00:08:16,625
No. I need them guarding my territory.

122
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:18,781
- But you have me.
- And me.

123
00:08:18,858 --> 00:08:20,656
I don't trust you.

124
00:08:20,711 --> 00:08:22,294
With or without that chip in your head.

125
00:08:22,362 --> 00:08:23,662
Jim.

126
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:26,876
They used me as a pawn
to murder innocent people.

127
00:08:26,915 --> 00:08:29,251
They messed with my brain.

128
00:08:29,313 --> 00:08:31,720
The thing that I want is revenge.

129
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,040
How do I know that chip
can't be reactivated?

130
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:37,395
Well, when you found
me at Strange's lab,

131
00:08:37,457 --> 00:08:40,053
he was fixing it after a...

132
00:08:40,113 --> 00:08:42,051
car battery mishap...

133
00:08:42,106 --> 00:08:44,750
I-It's safe to say
that I think you shorted it out.

134
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:46,996
Let me look at that.

135
00:08:47,095 --> 00:08:48,899
- What?
- Your neck.

136
00:08:53,893 --> 00:08:56,562
That's gonna need stitches.
I have a first aid kit.

137
00:08:56,629 --> 00:08:59,859
I need to keep moving.
Just name your fee.

138
00:08:59,929 --> 00:09:01,600
Can't I just want to help?

139
00:09:01,668 --> 00:09:03,802
Not you, not usually.

140
00:09:04,703 --> 00:09:06,017
Friend of mine just tried to kill me.

141
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:07,541
I don't want anyone else
waiting for an excuse

142
00:09:07,599 --> 00:09:09,533
- to stab me in the back.
- I gave you Gerry the Jerkwad,

143
00:09:09,611 --> 00:09:11,494
and I'm letting you hide out in my club.

144
00:09:11,533 --> 00:09:14,179
If I wanted to betray you,
I would have done it earlier.

145
00:09:14,213 --> 00:09:15,929
So, where's that first aid kit?

146
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:20,484
Gonna make myself useful.

147
00:09:21,374 --> 00:09:23,489
What's it gonna take
for you to trust me?

148
00:09:23,749 --> 00:09:28,560
After everything you've done,
I honestly don't know.

149
00:09:29,049 --> 00:09:31,403
I'd listen to her, Jim.

150
00:09:33,466 --> 00:09:36,924
I hear trust is in short supply.

151
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:47,238
You forget your PSYOPS training, Jim?

152
00:09:47,308 --> 00:09:50,210
Lesson one: when a person is in trouble,

153
00:09:50,287 --> 00:09:52,249
they go to a familiar place.

154
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:55,990
Your ex-fiancée's bar was
just a stone's throw away,

155
00:09:56,076 --> 00:09:58,928
so it's nice to finally
meet you, Barbara.

156
00:09:58,975 --> 00:10:00,442
Screw you.

157
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,244
Hmm.

158
00:10:02,947 --> 00:10:05,447
It seems you've lost your tail.

159
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:09,685
You mean the psychopath
you ordered to kill me?

160
00:10:09,753 --> 00:10:12,221
You had your chance.

161
00:10:12,288 --> 00:10:14,823
It could have been
like old times, buddy.

162
00:10:14,891 --> 00:10:16,492
You, me, together,

163
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:19,161
making the world a better place.

164
00:10:19,229 --> 00:10:22,309
- By murdering civilians?
- Civilians?

165
00:10:22,358 --> 00:10:26,268
This hellhole is infested
with criminals and terrorists.

166
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:28,636
Sometimes you just have
to clean house, you know?

167
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:30,104
I won't let you.

168
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,034
It's not your call, Jim.

169
00:10:33,677 --> 00:10:35,873
I'm not dead yet.

170
00:10:38,342 --> 00:10:41,011
James Gordon,
I've been ordered to kill you.

171
00:10:41,097 --> 00:10:43,620
Well, looks like you haven't
lost that tail after all.

172
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,350
If I die,

173
00:10:53,398 --> 00:10:56,925
you'll never get the evidence!

174
00:10:56,993 --> 00:10:59,257
Stand down.

175
00:11:03,566 --> 00:11:09,104
I have evidence that you
and Walker are behind Haven.

176
00:11:09,172 --> 00:11:13,108
If I die, it gets out
to the entire country.

177
00:11:13,176 --> 00:11:15,310
It's time to make a deal.

178
00:11:15,378 --> 00:11:17,813
You don't have any evidence.

179
00:11:17,881 --> 00:11:20,549
Is that a risk you're willing to take?

180
00:11:21,584 --> 00:11:23,519
It is.

181
00:11:23,586 --> 00:11:26,421
Nygma, kill them both.

182
00:12:10,293 --> 00:12:12,067
Bad time?

183
00:12:14,003 --> 00:12:16,271
What do you want?

184
00:12:22,211 --> 00:12:23,812
Depends.

185
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,414
What did <i>they</i> want?

186
00:12:26,065 --> 00:12:28,987
Oh. A shot at me.

187
00:12:29,831 --> 00:12:32,054
I killed Jeremiah Valeska.

188
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,757
So the rumors are true.

189
00:12:35,825 --> 00:12:37,426
Yeah.

190
00:12:37,571 --> 00:12:40,573
And now, every scumbag in town
wants to take me down

191
00:12:40,641 --> 00:12:42,671
to make a name for themselves.

192
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,561
So I got to find a new squat.

193
00:12:48,474 --> 00:12:53,035
How about, in exchange
for helping me find someone,

194
00:12:53,881 --> 00:12:56,078
I let you crash in my citadel?

195
00:12:56,145 --> 00:12:57,946
It's seen better days, but...

196
00:12:58,622 --> 00:13:01,416
- ...then again, right?
- Who?

197
00:13:01,851 --> 00:13:04,996
A miscreant I caught in the act
of stealing from me.

198
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,998
She was going to replace the stolen item

199
00:13:07,068 --> 00:13:10,912
with an exact replica,
except the replica was a bomb.

200
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,154
Ring any bells?

201
00:13:13,224 --> 00:13:14,998
White hair, feathered collar,

202
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,732
kind of of resembles a goth chicken?

203
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:18,567
You do know her.

204
00:13:19,902 --> 00:13:22,971
She goes by the name Magpie.

205
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:25,073
What'd she steal?

206
00:13:25,141 --> 00:13:27,776
The Russifer Diamond.

207
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:31,894
What makes you think I would help you

208
00:13:33,034 --> 00:13:36,018
after you killed Tabitha in cold blood?

209
00:13:36,085 --> 00:13:39,210
Because you believe
in an eye for an eye.

210
00:13:40,089 --> 00:13:42,391
Hard as it may be to swallow,

211
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:45,859
Tabitha made her bed
when she killed my mother.

212
00:13:50,066 --> 00:13:52,000
Tell you what.

213
00:13:52,068 --> 00:13:55,003
I will help you

214
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:58,573
if I get to keep the diamond.

215
00:14:02,512 --> 00:14:04,012
What?

216
00:14:07,184 --> 00:14:09,219
Not a chance.

217
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,020
Ha, ha, ha. Then you'll never find her.

218
00:14:12,088 --> 00:14:17,293
And every person in Gotham
will think it's okay

219
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,628
to steal from Penguin.

220
00:14:19,907 --> 00:14:21,457
Is that what you want?

221
00:14:23,733 --> 00:14:25,701
You know me too well.

222
00:14:26,845 --> 00:14:28,203
Fine.

223
00:14:29,405 --> 00:14:30,772
Good.

224
00:14:31,293 --> 00:14:32,960
- What happened?
- I want every soldier

225
00:14:33,023 --> 00:14:34,929
in the field looking for Jim Gordon.

226
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,403
Sir, we maxed out the holding cells.

227
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:40,028
We may need to keep men here
to control the overflow.

228
00:14:41,038 --> 00:14:43,247
Ethan, Sumiko.

229
00:14:43,319 --> 00:14:45,287
We're moving to phase two.

230
00:14:50,151 --> 00:14:51,852
What in the hell's going on?

231
00:14:51,937 --> 00:14:54,029
Listen up.

232
00:14:54,081 --> 00:14:56,633
I am not here to play nice.

233
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:59,267
I am not here to hold anyone's hand.

234
00:14:59,335 --> 00:15:01,970
I am here on a simple mission.

235
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,808
Any questions about the nature
of that mission?

236
00:15:06,901 --> 00:15:10,440
Are you insane?
You can't just execute people.

237
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,095
Do not question me.

238
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,016
This is the mission.
If you don't like it,

239
00:15:14,063 --> 00:15:15,985
you'll be locked up,
you'll remain locked up,

240
00:15:16,047 --> 00:15:17,790
until we purge the criminal element

241
00:15:17,844 --> 00:15:19,195
from the streets of Gotham.

242
00:15:20,032 --> 00:15:22,837
Sir, Secretary Walker's on the radio.

243
00:15:25,345 --> 00:15:28,055
We've moved on to phase two,
but we've lost track

244
00:15:28,111 --> 00:15:29,751
of Gordon and Nygma.

245
00:15:29,806 --> 00:15:32,051
I think Gordon found a way
to fry the chip.

246
00:15:32,106 --> 00:15:33,622
<i>We can't have Nygma</i>

247
00:15:33,676 --> 00:15:35,903
<i>in the wind with all that
evidence in his head.</i>

248
00:15:35,934 --> 00:15:38,129
Just trust me. Once we find them...

249
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:39,479
<i>Don't bother.</i>

250
00:15:39,575 --> 00:15:43,651
<i>I have an idea that will bring
Jim Gordon and Nygma to us.</i>

251
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:47,658
Thanks for getting everyone here.

252
00:15:47,769 --> 00:15:49,303
And for the Wayne R and D.

253
00:15:49,392 --> 00:15:52,754
Are you sure about including
Barbara Kean and Ed Nygma?

254
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:54,962
War makes for strange bedfellows.

255
00:15:55,025 --> 00:15:57,314
It's good to have
a friend nearby, Bruce.

256
00:15:57,377 --> 00:15:59,819
Ow! Would you be careful?

257
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,643
If you'll stop moving,
this will go a lot faster.

258
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:03,328
Well, if you would be
more careful, I wouldn't potato

259
00:16:03,412 --> 00:16:05,880
all the long legs from the hidden spoon.

260
00:16:05,948 --> 00:16:08,149
What just happened?

261
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,711
I believe the chip is installed
against his speech center.

262
00:16:10,812 --> 00:16:12,921
Huh. Do it again.

263
00:16:12,988 --> 00:16:15,523
The human brain is not
a plaything, Ms. Kean.

264
00:16:16,659 --> 00:16:19,423
Please don't habituate the curtain rod.

265
00:16:20,768 --> 00:16:23,486
And... ah.

266
00:16:23,655 --> 00:16:25,656
Stay.

267
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,471
There. How does that feel?

268
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,541
Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers.

269
00:16:33,609 --> 00:16:36,549
Oh, God. Thank you, Lucius.

270
00:16:37,546 --> 00:16:39,747
So what exactly are we looking for?

271
00:16:39,815 --> 00:16:42,783
Anything tying Walker or Eduardo
to the destruction of Haven.

272
00:16:42,849 --> 00:16:44,850
Why would Walker kill all those people?

273
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:47,214
That's what we have to find out.

274
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:49,315
Oh, yes.

275
00:16:52,269 --> 00:16:54,103
It appears the chip retains an audio log

276
00:16:54,163 --> 00:16:56,984
of every verbal communication
with Nygma while he was under.

277
00:16:57,052 --> 00:16:59,453
There's some damage, but...

278
00:16:59,515 --> 00:17:01,287
if the command to attack
Haven is still here,

279
00:17:01,335 --> 00:17:02,660
I can trace it back to the computer

280
00:17:02,705 --> 00:17:03,796
from which it originated.

281
00:17:03,835 --> 00:17:05,302
It has to be Walker.

282
00:17:05,382 --> 00:17:09,003
They won't be able to sweep
this under the rug anymore.

283
00:17:12,584 --> 00:17:14,386
Are you out there, Jim?

284
00:17:16,986 --> 00:17:18,658
What do you want?

285
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:22,173
We have someone here...

286
00:17:22,538 --> 00:17:24,728
...who wants to say hello.

287
00:17:28,704 --> 00:17:31,354
<i>J-Jim? What's happening?</i>

288
00:17:33,638 --> 00:17:35,086
Lee?

289
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,668
We found the Queen of the Narrows

290
00:17:43,742 --> 00:17:46,746
in a run-down hidey-hole
on the north side. Tell me,

291
00:17:46,794 --> 00:17:50,363
<i>how many ex-fiancées
do you have, anyway?</i>

292
00:17:50,431 --> 00:17:52,151
Leave her out of this.
She's not involved.

293
00:17:52,276 --> 00:17:55,068
<i>Ah, but she's a criminal,
and all criminals in Gotham</i>

294
00:17:55,136 --> 00:17:56,904
are now under a death sentence.

295
00:17:57,482 --> 00:18:00,441
<i>But what happens next is up to you.</i>

296
00:18:00,521 --> 00:18:02,288
A trade, perhaps.

297
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:05,971
Lee Thompkins for Ed Nygma.

298
00:18:07,737 --> 00:18:09,300
Fine.

299
00:18:10,033 --> 00:18:13,425
Good. Bring Nygma to the GCPD now.

300
00:18:13,501 --> 00:18:15,031
No, we meet at Haven.

301
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,170
I want you to see
the carnage you've caused.

302
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,051
<i>Always so emotional.</i>

303
00:18:19,094 --> 00:18:21,330
That's not how wars are won, Jim.

304
00:18:21,378 --> 00:18:23,212
Those are my terms. Take it or leave it.

305
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:29,398
Okay. I'll play your game.

306
00:18:31,546 --> 00:18:32,913
What are you doing?

307
00:18:32,981 --> 00:18:34,960
He's never gonna
let you walk out of there.

308
00:18:35,023 --> 00:18:38,285
I don't recall volunteering
as a trading chit!

309
00:18:38,353 --> 00:18:40,321
He doesn't want Ed. He wants the chip.

310
00:18:40,389 --> 00:18:41,946
So I'll give him the chip.

311
00:18:41,993 --> 00:18:44,735
Bruce, do you have any contacts
in the mainland press?

312
00:18:44,797 --> 00:18:46,321
Several.

313
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,462
What would it take to broadcast
the information from the chip

314
00:18:48,537 --> 00:18:50,717
- to the mainland?
- A transmitter, which I have,

315
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,014
and a very large antenna,
which I do not.

316
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:57,343
I know where there's an antenna
in the Green Zone,

317
00:18:57,398 --> 00:18:58,481
but you're not gonna like it.

318
00:18:58,514 --> 00:19:00,715
The roof of the GCPD.

319
00:19:06,055 --> 00:19:07,744
Lee.

320
00:19:12,314 --> 00:19:13,986
- Harvey.
- Where the hell have you been?

321
00:19:14,072 --> 00:19:15,363
You've been gone for months.

322
00:19:15,431 --> 00:19:16,598
I don't know.

323
00:19:17,603 --> 00:19:20,068
I can't remember anything.

324
00:19:20,136 --> 00:19:21,669
What happened to me?

325
00:19:21,737 --> 00:19:25,073
I don't know. We're gonna figure it out.

326
00:19:25,141 --> 00:19:26,307
I promise.

327
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:27,709
Let's go.

328
00:19:29,557 --> 00:19:31,625
It's gonna be okay.

329
00:19:38,909 --> 00:19:40,276
<i>Eduardo just arrived.</i>

330
00:19:40,315 --> 00:19:42,261
<i>He brought backup, like we expected.</i>

331
00:19:42,323 --> 00:19:43,862
- <i>Time to move.</i>
- Copy that.

332
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,931
Let's go.

333
00:20:00,007 --> 00:20:02,411
Jim! Who are these people?

334
00:20:02,959 --> 00:20:04,803
I'm gonna get you out of here, Lee.

335
00:20:05,498 --> 00:20:07,319
I'm not sure that's true, Jim.

336
00:20:07,779 --> 00:20:10,020
It seems you forgot to bring someone.

337
00:20:10,045 --> 00:20:12,591
It's hard to make a swap
when you have nothing to trade.

338
00:20:14,037 --> 00:20:16,662
We both know this
is really what you want.

339
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:19,848
Proof that you and Walker
are responsible

340
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:21,382
for the destruction of Haven

341
00:20:21,441 --> 00:20:24,277
and the murder of hundreds
of innocent people.

342
00:20:28,082 --> 00:20:29,816
Now let her go.

343
00:20:29,884 --> 00:20:33,048
Let me guess, you made a copy

344
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:35,497
so you can do this little bit
of theatrics for me.

345
00:20:35,564 --> 00:20:37,394
I expected more from you, Jim.

346
00:20:37,472 --> 00:20:42,097
Three soldiers against one man
without a gun.

347
00:20:43,905 --> 00:20:46,140
You sure you brought enough help?

348
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,775
I don't need any help.

349
00:20:47,842 --> 00:20:51,678
Is that why you sent Nygma
to do your dirty work?

350
00:20:51,746 --> 00:20:54,455
So he could pick up your slack
like I used to?

351
00:20:54,494 --> 00:20:58,668
Still dining out on pulling me
from that burning truck.

352
00:20:58,738 --> 00:21:00,770
I carried more than my fair share.

353
00:21:00,824 --> 00:21:02,423
I was always the first man in.

354
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:04,395
Your recklessness got people killed.

355
00:21:04,449 --> 00:21:06,712
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

356
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:07,767
Ramirez?

357
00:21:07,806 --> 00:21:08,829
No.

358
00:21:08,855 --> 00:21:10,329
Johnson.

359
00:21:10,411 --> 00:21:11,645
Bolton.

360
00:21:11,714 --> 00:21:13,228
Their deaths were not on me.

361
00:21:14,157 --> 00:21:16,268
Yeah.

362
00:21:16,638 --> 00:21:19,448
Put a bullet in my mouth and shut me up.

363
00:21:20,815 --> 00:21:22,910
No.

364
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:25,846
Not a bullet.

365
00:21:25,914 --> 00:21:27,875
But I am gonna shut your mouth.

366
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:29,765
Once and for all.

367
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:31,562
Come try.

368
00:21:38,349 --> 00:21:40,761
- You sure this is the place?
- Yep.

369
00:21:40,858 --> 00:21:43,120
This is the place.

370
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:57,797
Stop her!

371
00:21:59,457 --> 00:22:02,214
Ouchie. You're quick.

372
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:09,335
I know you?

373
00:22:09,497 --> 00:22:11,963
- Doubt it.
- Uh-huh.

374
00:22:12,104 --> 00:22:15,408
You killed Jeremiah. You're famous.

375
00:22:15,471 --> 00:22:17,697
Not so scary.

376
00:22:17,768 --> 00:22:19,169
I could be famous.

377
00:22:19,236 --> 00:22:20,916
You want a shot at me, too?

378
00:22:20,978 --> 00:22:24,307
Unfortunately, you won't
have the opportunity.

379
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:25,842
Careful.

380
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,811
This is my workshop

381
00:22:27,878 --> 00:22:29,846
where I make my boom-booms.

382
00:22:29,914 --> 00:22:32,782
Anything here, boom, boom.
Then more boom

383
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,818
and more boom, then the whole room...

384
00:22:34,885 --> 00:22:38,409
- Boom, boom. We get it.
- You're bluffing.

385
00:22:38,464 --> 00:22:39,489
Catch.

386
00:22:39,557 --> 00:22:42,092
Ooh! No, no!

387
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:47,609
Whoops!

388
00:22:47,634 --> 00:22:50,700
That watch must have been an original,

389
00:22:50,768 --> 00:22:53,269
but other stuff in there, boom, boom.

390
00:22:53,337 --> 00:22:54,904
Good luck.

391
00:23:05,616 --> 00:23:07,051
We tie our shoelaces together,

392
00:23:07,113 --> 00:23:09,085
then we lasso the keys off the desk.

393
00:23:09,153 --> 00:23:12,789
And then what, Roy Rogers, huh?
They surrender in awe?

394
00:23:12,857 --> 00:23:16,359
No harebrained scheme is
gonna get us out of this.

395
00:23:16,427 --> 00:23:18,228
Hello!

396
00:23:19,597 --> 00:23:21,731
Hope you don't mind, I...

397
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:24,946
borrowed some cop stuff from the garage.

398
00:23:25,008 --> 00:23:27,370
Oh, boy, you can put your guns down.

399
00:23:27,453 --> 00:23:30,355
Kevlar in this thing
is designed to withstand a blast

400
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:33,109
that can tear down a building
twice this size.

401
00:23:33,177 --> 00:23:34,177
What is that?

402
00:23:35,579 --> 00:23:37,514
Is it not obvious?

403
00:23:37,581 --> 00:23:39,199
It's a bomb!

404
00:23:39,316 --> 00:23:41,894
Okay.

405
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:44,667
Let's play a game.

406
00:23:48,554 --> 00:23:52,094
- Clear out.
- Ah, ah, ah, ah.

407
00:23:52,171 --> 00:23:55,006
If anyone leaves this building,
this thing blows.

408
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:59,677
You gomers messed with
the wrong super genius,

409
00:23:59,752 --> 00:24:02,015
and now it's time for a little payback.

410
00:24:02,132 --> 00:24:04,374
Nygma, you're a son of a bitch!

411
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:07,892
Oh, not now, Bullock.

412
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,013
The body count at Haven
wasn't big enough for you, huh?

413
00:24:11,076 --> 00:24:12,476
Shut up!

414
00:24:12,501 --> 00:24:14,268
What's your game?

415
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:16,695
The only way to deactivate this bomb

416
00:24:16,781 --> 00:24:19,672
is to put a four-digit code
on the keypad there.

417
00:24:19,726 --> 00:24:21,260
What's the code?

418
00:24:24,264 --> 00:24:29,201
The pallid beach mouse
can give birth every four weeks.

419
00:24:30,306 --> 00:24:32,603
Assuming we start with two mice,

420
00:24:32,665 --> 00:24:36,556
and that the size
of an average litter is 12 mice,

421
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:40,245
and that they are equally
split male to female,

422
00:24:40,313 --> 00:24:43,217
how many pallid beach mice

423
00:24:43,291 --> 00:24:47,811
would we have at the end of one year?

424
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:53,993
The answer to that question is the code.

425
00:24:54,138 --> 00:24:56,006
Oh, I almost forgot.

426
00:24:56,093 --> 00:24:58,393
You have two minutes.

427
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:02,808
After that, everyone in here goes splat.

428
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:05,582
Except for me, of course.

429
00:25:21,567 --> 00:25:23,168
I'm in position.

430
00:25:25,071 --> 00:25:27,105
Copy. Plug the recorder
to the transmitter.

431
00:25:27,173 --> 00:25:29,107
Next, you'll connect
the transmitter to the radio.

432
00:25:29,175 --> 00:25:31,217
There should be a black box
at the base of the antenna.

433
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,655
Let me know when you get it open.

434
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,741
Nygma's bomb ploy won't last forever.

435
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:38,416
We just have to wait for
the exhaust fans to come

436
00:25:38,484 --> 00:25:41,316
to a complete stop before
you can use the gas.

437
00:25:57,018 --> 00:25:58,652
What are you doing?

438
00:26:15,521 --> 00:26:20,191
You want to take responsibility
for people dying?

439
00:26:20,259 --> 00:26:22,494
Look around.

440
00:26:22,561 --> 00:26:24,029
This is all on you.

441
00:26:24,096 --> 00:26:25,664
What the hell does that mean?

442
00:26:25,731 --> 00:26:27,399
Walker spent months

443
00:26:27,466 --> 00:26:30,001
trying to convince
her superiors that Gotham

444
00:26:30,069 --> 00:26:32,237
was overrun by criminals.

445
00:26:32,305 --> 00:26:35,373
We were this close to being sent in

446
00:26:35,441 --> 00:26:37,609
when you set up Haven.

447
00:26:37,677 --> 00:26:40,545
The fact that one man was able

448
00:26:40,613 --> 00:26:42,280
to safely house and rescue hundreds

449
00:26:42,348 --> 00:26:44,716
of innocent civilians
showed the military higher-ups

450
00:26:44,784 --> 00:26:46,818
that the criminal element of Gotham

451
00:26:46,886 --> 00:26:50,088
must not be so big and scary after all.

452
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:53,591
They were ready to send in relief,

453
00:26:53,659 --> 00:26:56,594
so it had to come down.

454
00:26:56,662 --> 00:27:00,699
Why? What the hell does she want?

455
00:27:00,766 --> 00:27:03,802
They were innocent people, children.

456
00:27:03,869 --> 00:27:07,405
They were an acceptable loss
for the mission.

457
00:27:08,152 --> 00:27:09,848
What mission, damn it?

458
00:27:24,657 --> 00:27:26,224
That's enough.

459
00:27:29,684 --> 00:27:32,656
Take her out back and shoot her.

460
00:27:35,312 --> 00:27:37,932
He doesn't need to see this.

461
00:27:39,987 --> 00:27:41,506
It's my gift to you,

462
00:27:41,574 --> 00:27:43,557
a small mercy.

463
00:27:50,211 --> 00:27:52,617
You never should have
brought her into this, Eduardo.

464
00:28:07,658 --> 00:28:09,626
Can we speed things along,
please, Mr. Fox?

465
00:28:09,694 --> 00:28:11,475
The exhaust fans have to wind down

466
00:28:11,553 --> 00:28:13,236
before they can change directions.

467
00:28:13,311 --> 00:28:16,014
If you throw the canisters in
now, the gas will blow outside.

468
00:28:16,077 --> 00:28:18,043
Bruce, status?

469
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:21,451
One second.

470
00:28:28,754 --> 00:28:30,989
I'm here. The box is open.

471
00:28:31,056 --> 00:28:32,767
<i>Two dark green wires right in front.</i>

472
00:28:32,837 --> 00:28:35,064
<i>Attach those to the transmitter.
The message will send.</i>

473
00:28:44,437 --> 00:28:46,404
It's done.

474
00:28:50,743 --> 00:28:52,644
One minute left.

475
00:28:53,446 --> 00:28:55,272
Everybody hear that?

476
00:28:55,357 --> 00:28:58,936
One minute before this thing explodes.

477
00:28:59,459 --> 00:29:00,861
I know the answer.

478
00:29:01,548 --> 00:29:05,056
Uh... Nope, don't think you do, Bullock.

479
00:29:05,142 --> 00:29:08,077
My high school zoology class is
still rattling around up here.

480
00:29:08,147 --> 00:29:09,861
High school was a long time ago,

481
00:29:09,929 --> 00:29:12,530
so let's just take
the full minute, shall we?

482
00:29:12,598 --> 00:29:14,132
Really think about it.

483
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,538
I don't need to.

484
00:29:15,616 --> 00:29:18,392
The pallid beach mouse is extinct.

485
00:29:19,472 --> 00:29:22,860
It disappeared in 1959.

486
00:29:22,907 --> 00:29:25,869
The number you'll have at
the end of the year is zero.

487
00:29:25,947 --> 00:29:28,916
The number is zero. Trust me on this.

488
00:29:28,979 --> 00:29:31,182
I got in trouble. I had to
write an essay about it.

489
00:29:31,245 --> 00:29:32,579
I swear to God.

490
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,900
Oh, dear.

491
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,564
I got a math problem for you.

492
00:30:02,612 --> 00:30:04,313
Count these bullets.

493
00:30:21,996 --> 00:30:23,096
Yes!

494
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,295
You want to know why

495
00:30:25,362 --> 00:30:28,156
Ramirez and the rest didn't make it out?

496
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,135
After your tour of duty was up,

497
00:30:32,203 --> 00:30:34,003
we were caught behind enemy lines,

498
00:30:34,071 --> 00:30:36,239
taken to the darkest hell on Earth...

499
00:30:37,908 --> 00:30:39,642
Peña Duro.

500
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:40,877
Have you heard of it?

501
00:30:40,945 --> 00:30:44,380
Prison? I didn't know.

502
00:30:44,448 --> 00:30:46,783
No one did,

503
00:30:46,851 --> 00:30:51,120
'cause it's where we were
left to die by our government.

504
00:30:51,188 --> 00:30:53,790
I was the only one that survived.

505
00:30:53,858 --> 00:30:55,091
Walker...

506
00:30:55,159 --> 00:30:57,138
Walker, she found me in that place.

507
00:30:57,234 --> 00:30:58,368
She pulled me out.

508
00:30:58,424 --> 00:31:00,763
She gave me a new purpose.

509
00:31:00,831 --> 00:31:02,365
She made you her killer.

510
00:31:02,416 --> 00:31:04,396
No, no, Jim.

511
00:31:05,607 --> 00:31:07,275
She's the killer.

512
00:31:07,506 --> 00:31:10,042
And you have no idea.

513
00:31:26,931 --> 00:31:28,627
Lee?

514
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:51,619
You and your stupid revenge.

515
00:31:51,657 --> 00:31:54,718
The diamond isn't even worth
anything in Gotham anyway.

516
00:31:57,722 --> 00:31:59,741
Unless...

517
00:32:02,626 --> 00:32:06,116
The diamond is worth
something on the mainland.

518
00:32:06,186 --> 00:32:09,631
And I bet you have

519
00:32:09,662 --> 00:32:13,269
way more where that came from.

520
00:32:16,907 --> 00:32:19,162
You're leaving Gotham.

521
00:32:22,031 --> 00:32:25,367
Congratulations, you're a genius.

522
00:32:25,435 --> 00:32:27,135
Why?

523
00:32:27,841 --> 00:32:30,072
"Alexander the Great

524
00:32:30,139 --> 00:32:32,574
"then looked upon his land

525
00:32:32,642 --> 00:32:34,209
"and wept.

526
00:32:34,277 --> 00:32:37,346
For there was nothing left to conquer."

527
00:32:40,216 --> 00:32:42,584
I've done all I can in Gotham.

528
00:32:43,791 --> 00:32:45,491
Some things twice.

529
00:32:47,156 --> 00:32:49,224
There's nothing left
for me here anymore.

530
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:53,395
I want in.

531
00:32:54,864 --> 00:32:58,187
I can't even walk around the city

532
00:32:58,248 --> 00:33:00,507
without some lowlife
trying to take me out.

533
00:33:00,593 --> 00:33:02,604
Just so he can up his cred.

534
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:06,276
I don't want to be the person
who killed Jeremiah Valeska.

535
00:33:08,011 --> 00:33:10,212
I just want to be myself.

536
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:14,897
And I can't do that in Gotham anymore.

537
00:33:16,052 --> 00:33:17,999
My heart weeps for you.

538
00:33:18,855 --> 00:33:21,023
But no.

539
00:33:22,659 --> 00:33:24,926
What if I could get us out of here?

540
00:33:25,072 --> 00:33:27,507
You do that, I will cut you in.

541
00:33:27,568 --> 00:33:28,968
50-50.

542
00:33:29,036 --> 00:33:33,272
Ten percent, and I won't murder you

543
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:36,175
- once we reach the mainland.
- Deal.

544
00:33:37,244 --> 00:33:38,544
Selina, wait!

545
00:33:42,716 --> 00:33:48,621
She said, "Anything in the room
could be a bomb."

546
00:33:48,689 --> 00:33:50,523
Not the room itself.

547
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:55,235
- Did you know that the whole time?
- Just thought of it.

548
00:33:55,438 --> 00:33:56,628
We should hurry before

549
00:33:56,706 --> 00:33:58,173
she gets away with all our stuff.

550
00:33:58,261 --> 00:34:00,099
Don't worry.

551
00:34:00,167 --> 00:34:02,435
She won't get far.

552
00:34:04,071 --> 00:34:06,973
Alvarez, take Lee to my office.

553
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,841
Be right there.

554
00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:11,223
I got to be honest with you, man.

555
00:34:11,248 --> 00:34:13,212
I don't know how many more
of these close calls

556
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,692
this old heart can take.

557
00:34:14,717 --> 00:34:16,215
We were able to transmit the audio logs,

558
00:34:16,283 --> 00:34:17,826
but until I hear back from my contacts,

559
00:34:17,888 --> 00:34:19,318
I won't know if they received them.

560
00:34:19,386 --> 00:34:20,686
Well, if they did,

561
00:34:20,754 --> 00:34:22,288
probably have a lot of questions.

562
00:34:22,356 --> 00:34:24,232
We'll spend the night and help out.

563
00:34:24,294 --> 00:34:26,185
Alfred can go back to the
apartment and grab what you can?

564
00:34:26,274 --> 00:34:28,108
Certainly, Master Bruce.

565
00:34:28,762 --> 00:34:30,129
Thanks, Bruce.

566
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:34,846
The next time I get a short straw,

567
00:34:34,927 --> 00:34:36,569
I'm just gonna walk into traffic.

568
00:34:36,637 --> 00:34:39,572
Where has Lee been this whole time?

569
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,174
I don't know.

570
00:34:41,241 --> 00:34:42,976
I'm not gonna wait around

571
00:34:43,051 --> 00:34:45,593
to watch their touching reunion.

572
00:34:53,921 --> 00:34:56,062
What is happening here?

573
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:59,258
I don't know where to start.

574
00:35:00,163 --> 00:35:01,765
When I didn't hear from you,

575
00:35:02,463 --> 00:35:04,788
I'd hoped you'd gotten out of Gotham.

576
00:35:05,799 --> 00:35:08,334
The last thing that I remember

577
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,304
is Jeremiah destroying the bridges.

578
00:35:11,793 --> 00:35:13,528
That was over three months ago.

579
00:35:13,598 --> 00:35:16,075
Three months? Oh, my God.

580
00:35:16,143 --> 00:35:17,910
You don't remember anything?

581
00:35:17,978 --> 00:35:20,213
I'm trying, and...

582
00:35:21,315 --> 00:35:23,983
Right before the bridges came down,

583
00:35:24,051 --> 00:35:25,985
you said you were leaving the city.

584
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:28,488
- Why didn't you?
- I don't know, Jim.

585
00:35:28,555 --> 00:35:30,756
None of this is making any sense.

586
00:35:32,626 --> 00:35:34,494
We're still cut off.

587
00:35:35,562 --> 00:35:37,196
There's no help.

588
00:35:37,264 --> 00:35:39,265
It's been hard.

589
00:35:40,834 --> 00:35:43,402
Actually, that's not true.

590
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:45,705
It's been hell.

591
00:35:46,391 --> 00:35:47,962
People needed hope,

592
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:50,009
so I put on a brave face.

593
00:35:50,854 --> 00:35:53,039
Pretended I knew what to do.

594
00:35:53,213 --> 00:35:55,381
But you know me, Lee.

595
00:35:55,449 --> 00:35:57,149
I'm just a cop.

596
00:36:00,747 --> 00:36:03,278
And now I'm really lost.

597
00:36:03,867 --> 00:36:05,801
Hey, it's okay.

598
00:36:07,728 --> 00:36:09,962
We're here now.

599
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:14,700
We'll just try to put
the pieces back together again.

600
00:36:15,127 --> 00:36:16,969
Maybe we can help each other.

601
00:36:19,444 --> 00:36:21,574
Let's start with my memory.

602
00:36:23,777 --> 00:36:26,312
I went back to the Narrows.

603
00:36:27,173 --> 00:36:29,315
I saw Ed.

604
00:36:29,383 --> 00:36:32,118
We fought. We...

605
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:34,490
Oh.

606
00:36:35,255 --> 00:36:36,856
He stabbed me.

607
00:36:36,924 --> 00:36:39,605
- What?
- Wait, let me remember.

608
00:36:39,688 --> 00:36:42,056
I stabbed him.

609
00:36:42,429 --> 00:36:44,797
There was so much blood.

610
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,768
Then I was...

611
00:36:49,969 --> 00:36:51,870
somewhere...

612
00:36:53,407 --> 00:36:55,174
A hospital, maybe?

613
00:37:19,454 --> 00:37:22,702
Eduardo.

614
00:37:22,769 --> 00:37:24,704
So much potential,

615
00:37:24,771 --> 00:37:27,073
but not quite up to the task.

616
00:37:28,141 --> 00:37:29,075
Walker.

617
00:37:30,439 --> 00:37:32,106
How?

618
00:37:32,171 --> 00:37:34,013
We've been burned.

619
00:37:34,081 --> 00:37:35,681
The press have recordings of me

620
00:37:35,749 --> 00:37:38,718
instructing Nygma to take down Haven.

621
00:37:38,785 --> 00:37:40,703
I thought I might accomplish my task

622
00:37:40,804 --> 00:37:42,946
without setting foot in this foul city,

623
00:37:43,025 --> 00:37:45,860
but that's not to be.

624
00:37:47,227 --> 00:37:50,463
You won't die yet, my warrior.

625
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:53,733
There is so much more for you to do.

626
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,203
Professor Strange will have you
fixed up in no time.

627
00:38:07,181 --> 00:38:09,616
Jim Gordon.

628
00:38:09,816 --> 00:38:12,251
Don't worry about Gordon.

629
00:38:12,319 --> 00:38:14,720
Nygma was never alone.

630
00:38:15,514 --> 00:38:17,888
There was a second operative.

631
00:38:23,664 --> 00:38:24,664
You okay?

632
00:38:24,731 --> 00:38:26,732
You cold?

633
00:38:30,671 --> 00:38:33,079
The hospitals were
all out of commission.

634
00:38:33,165 --> 00:38:35,782
Just the one clinic in the green zone.

635
00:38:40,549 --> 00:38:41,820
Lee?

636
00:38:41,894 --> 00:38:43,662
Time to die, Jim Gordon.

637
00:39:49,984 --> 00:39:52,052
Ah...

638
00:39:56,524 --> 00:39:59,838
Wanted: one butler.

639
00:40:00,502 --> 00:40:02,929
Military background a plus.

640
00:40:02,997 --> 00:40:05,338
References required.

641
00:40:06,369 --> 00:40:09,569
Yes, Mr. Pennyworth.

642
00:40:10,072 --> 00:40:12,572
I have a job for you.

643
00:40:21,137 --> 00:40:22,649
Well, you weren't lying when you said

644
00:40:22,717 --> 00:40:24,050
she wouldn't get far.

645
00:40:26,025 --> 00:40:30,190
Pretty crown's... booby-trapped.

646
00:40:30,257 --> 00:40:32,158
Ouch.

647
00:40:32,226 --> 00:40:33,793
Ouch, indeed.

648
00:40:34,243 --> 00:40:36,377
I couldn't have you coming back here

649
00:40:36,459 --> 00:40:38,725
and making off with
all of my belongings.

650
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:41,746
Our belongings.

651
00:40:41,832 --> 00:40:45,356
Cut my wings, let me go?

652
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,667
Bang, bang.

653
00:40:49,805 --> 00:40:50,961
What the hell?

654
00:40:51,016 --> 00:40:53,480
The buckshot in her gut
wasn't enough punishment?

655
00:40:53,547 --> 00:40:55,348
Just a little reminder of what happens

656
00:40:55,416 --> 00:40:57,484
when people try to steal from me.

657
00:40:59,406 --> 00:41:01,125
Good to know.

658
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:04,090
Partner.

659
00:41:08,525 --> 00:41:10,697
So Lee has a chip, too?

660
00:41:11,088 --> 00:41:13,400
I don't know how, but it seems that way.

661
00:41:13,814 --> 00:41:15,568
Walker must have been holding onto her

662
00:41:15,636 --> 00:41:17,337
as some sort of plan B this whole time.

663
00:41:17,405 --> 00:41:20,214
Three months? That's a hell
of a long game she's playing.

664
00:41:20,284 --> 00:41:23,410
Which means she probably has
other tricks up her sleeve.

665
00:41:26,046 --> 00:41:27,414
Hey.

666
00:41:31,118 --> 00:41:32,698
- Welcome back.
- Oh, hell.

667
00:41:32,776 --> 00:41:35,422
This is gonna keep happening.

668
00:41:35,567 --> 00:41:37,301
What's wrong with me?

669
00:41:38,407 --> 00:41:41,063
The good news is, I think
I can actually answer that.

670
00:41:43,111 --> 00:41:45,045
Jim.

671
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,354
I need to talk to you.

672
00:41:46,414 --> 00:41:48,616
Now is not a good time, Barbara.

673
00:41:49,802 --> 00:41:52,059
Don't you remember the good time
we had the other night?

674
00:41:52,145 --> 00:41:53,677
- Over there?
- Say what?

675
00:41:53,747 --> 00:41:55,356
You need to leave now.

676
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,591
I'm pregnant.

677
00:42:00,262 --> 00:42:02,363
Good to see you, Lee.

678
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:04,098
Long time.

679
00:42:12,073 --> 00:42:13,774
Congratulations?

680
00:42:24,185 --> 00:42:25,553
You.

681
00:42:26,056 --> 00:42:28,088
You're supposed to be dead, mate.

682
00:42:28,189 --> 00:42:30,848
Sorry to disappoint.

683
00:42:31,126 --> 00:42:33,794
You hurt my boy...

684
00:42:34,348 --> 00:42:36,897
and I will bite your face off.

685
00:42:39,059 --> 00:42:40,868
Yeah. Yeah.

686
00:42:41,823 --> 00:42:45,940
Ah... Bruce will be along shortly.

687
00:42:46,436 --> 00:42:48,537
In the meantime...

688
00:42:50,936 --> 00:42:52,970
This place is in desperate need

689
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:56,062
of some good, old-fashioned butlering.

690
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:01,664
How did you even find a way off
the bloody island anyway?

691
00:43:01,867 --> 00:43:03,390
How?

692
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:06,601
One if by land, two if by sea,

693
00:43:06,921 --> 00:43:09,663
three if by digging
a tunnel under the river.

694
00:43:09,731 --> 00:43:12,664
But enough questions.

695
00:43:15,865 --> 00:43:18,648
Today is the big day.

696
00:43:20,457 --> 00:43:25,457
