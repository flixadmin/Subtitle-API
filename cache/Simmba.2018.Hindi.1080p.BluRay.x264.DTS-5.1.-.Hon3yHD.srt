1
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:04,000
'Miramar Police station.'

2
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,208
'There's just
been an encounter here.'

3
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:09,833
"Although this encounter
is off records...'

4
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:12,250
'...but, this is the
first honest deed by the

5
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:14,250
officer-in-charge of this Station.'

6
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,125
'The story begins from
the same place I once did.'

7
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:20,625
'Shivgadh.'

8
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:25,583
“While I was striving
to be an honest cop...'

9
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:29,125
'...there was a kid who
wanted to be just like me.'

10
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:33,750
“But, his intentions
were completely different.'

11
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:45,333
What...

12
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:46,333
What...

13
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:49,875
Picking pockets at your age.

14
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:51,500
What...

15
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,166
Don't you feel ashamed?

16
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:56,875
Hey, anywhere is fine,
but not on my head.

17
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:57,750
What?

18
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:58,625
Who are you?

19
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:00,250
- Simmba!
- Simmba?

20
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:01,916
What kind of a name is that?

21
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:05,958
Shortform Simmba, full name;
Sangram Bhalerao.

22
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:09,375
You guys have no clue who I work for.

23
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:11,375
- Who
- Lokhande.

24
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:14,083
When he gets here,
you will all be shaking in your boots.

25
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,125
Deshpande sir, hello.

26
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:20,375
Hello, Gaikwad sir.

27
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:22,625
- How are you, Lokhande?
- All well, sir.

28
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:25,000
Sir, he's one of my boys.

29
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,875
Let him go.

30
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,750
Is he Lokhande?

31
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:33,750
How dare you make orphans pickpocket.

32
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:35,666
Sir...sir...

33
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:36,625
You bloody...

34
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:39,375
Sir...sir...sir, let it go now.

35
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,750
Stop humiliating
me in front of the kid.

36
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:45,125
Sir...take this.

37
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:50,625
Get lost!

38
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,125
What are you staring at me for?

39
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,000
You always said you're a powerful guy.

40
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:08,291
But he snatched your money.

41
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,125
Because he's more powerful than I am.

42
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,250
And do you know why?

43
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:14,083
Because he's got a uniform.

44
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:18,375
And anyone who dons this
uniform controls everything.

45
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,250
What are you looking at?

46
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:32,000
Just that picking pockets for a loser like
you won't do any wonders for my career.

47
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,000
Now even I want to be powerful.

48
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:37,208
- And there's only one thing I want.
- What?

49
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:40,625
Uniform! Police Uniform!

50
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:42,125
Understand!

51
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:55,000
Since that day,
Simmba made up his mind...

52
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:57,875
...that he'll become a Police
Officer when he grows up.

53
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,375
Simmba was an orphan.

54
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:11,250
But studying,
and getting a degree was very crucial.

55
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:15,500
And a night school teacher
Gayatri helped Simmba with it.

56
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,625
Andaz Apna Apna Showing now.

57
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:34,916
Only for 40. 40...40...

58
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,125
Buy one, it's a fantastic movie.

59
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:37,875
Only 40...40...40...

60
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:41,250
Hey Shortie,
go sell your tickets someplace else.

61
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,250
This is Durva Ranade's area.

62
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:44,708
You know what...

63
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:46,333
...tell your Durva Ranade...

64
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:48,500
...to meet me after 5.

65
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,916
I'll see what I can do.

66
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,125
He speaks a bit too much.

67
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,958
You bloody...

68
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:13,000
There's five of you,
and I am all alone.

69
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:16,958
But whoever strikes first...

70
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:19,000
...I will definitely break his bone.

71
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:26,750
What...

72
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:29,875
Size medium, and guts extra-large.

73
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:33,750
Go on...from today this
theatre's your area.

74
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:36,958
Boss, you're giving the
entire area to this little kid.

75
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:39,958
Then why didn't you step up?

76
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:42,500
You thought he will kill you.

77
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:45,833
You thought right.

78
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:47,750
He would've killed you.

79
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:51,583
He's like a little cracker
waiting to explode one day.

80
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,208
Will you work for me?

81
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:01,250
I've already decided my future.

82
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:07,125
I see...what will you
do when you grow up?

83
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,833
POLICE!

84
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:13,458
"Police!"

85
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:16,750
"Police!"

86
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:19,875
"Police!"

87
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,875
"Here comes Police."

88
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,625
"Here...Here...Here..."

89
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,458
"Here comes Simmba."

90
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:52,750
"Here comes Simmba."

91
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:02,333
"Thief..."

92
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:05,500
"...Police."

93
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:08,708
"Catch...thief..."

94
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:11,875
"Here comes Simmba."

95
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,208
- "Simmba... Simmba..."
- Take them down.

96
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:14,875
- "He's going to...“
- "Beat you down."

97
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,500
- "It's true..."
- "Every word."

98
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,458
- “But if you lie..."
- "You're dead."

99
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:26,375
"Hey Simmba...
Hey Simmba... Hey Simmba..."

100
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:29,708
"Simmba... Simmba... Simmba..."

101
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:38,750
"Take him down."

102
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:41,875
"Take him down."

103
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,125
"Take him down."

104
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:50,875
"Here comes Simmba."

105
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,250
"Take him down."

106
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,458
"Take him down."

107
00:08:58,541 --> 00:08:59,500
"Take him down."

108
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,583
"Take him down."

109
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:08,083
"Here comes Simmba."

110
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:10,125
You fool...

111
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:13,500
First of all, you commit a
crime in Inspector Bhalerao's area.

112
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:15,833
Plus you stole Five million.

113
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:17,708
Bloody thief...

114
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,500
No, sir. We haven't done anything.

115
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,958
Dagdu...don't pamper me.

116
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,583
Otherwise, my temper will hamper you.

117
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,125
- Mhatre.
- Yes, sir.

118
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:31,583
These days everyone's
running after gold.

119
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,666
Even Aamir Khan wanted
Gold in "Dangal"...

120
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,791
...but, he wanted to win it,
and not steal it.

121
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,708
You made a big mistake.

122
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:39,416
You won't be seeing
daylight anytime soon.

123
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:44,375
According to my calculation, you'll
be serving time for at least 10 years.

124
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:49,458
I was saying, let's arrive on some
kind of mutual understanding on this.

125
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:50,791
And, we're prepared
to pay some money...

126
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:54,375
Hey...l am only hung-y for love.
not money.

127
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:57,125
And I love only money.

128
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:58,250
Meaning?

129
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,750
Meaning, it's against my principles,
but imagine that I agree...

130
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:07,625
...and take some money from you,
then how much cash do you guys have?

131
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:09,125
100,000, sir!

132
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:13,833
And, if you're willing to give
something, then how much can you give?

133
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,166
25,000

134
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:19,250
- How much?
- Sir, 25,000.

135
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:20,750
- How much?
- Sir, 25,000.

136
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:24,125
So 25+25+25 meaning I get 75,000.

137
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,125
Mind blowing, done.

138
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,500
- Hey...
- Hey...

139
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,125
Open your mouth again,
and I'll look you all up.

140
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,125
- Mhatre.
- Yes, sir.

141
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:34,416
I was saying, the guy whose store they stole
from we'll have to take from him also.

142
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:38,250
- You mean 'give'.
- Not give, 'take'.

143
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:40,208
- What's his name?
- Hashmukh Parekh.

144
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:43,250
Ohh, Hashmukh.

145
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:46,750
Superb. Superb. Superb.

146
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:49,625
Brother, you've completely
changed that saying.

147
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:54,333
One knockout is better
than 100 punches.

148
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:57,375
Honestly speaking,
I had stopped expecting.

149
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,500
Don't lie, Hasmukh.

150
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,625
You look like you're expecting.

151
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,125
- Mhatre.
- Yes, sir.

152
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:06,750
Collect the receipt of all
the things and hand them over.

153
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,375
What?

154
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,000
All this belongs to you,
doesn't it, Hashmukh.

155
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:11,416
So we need receipts
for Police records.

156
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:13,291
- It is a formula.
- Sir, formality.

157
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:14,333
Yes, a formality.

158
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:20,625
You see, brother, I have a receipt
for 50% of the stuff, but the rest...

159
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:26,500
- Meaning...” rest of it Is Illegal.
- No.

160
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,541
- Meaning betraying your own country.
- No.

161
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:30,500
No! No!

162
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,125
One who troubles me
doesn't escape my wrath.

163
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,375
Mhatre, arrest him.

164
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:36,125
- Arrest him.
- No. No.

165
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:38,541
No, please let him go.

166
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:40,833
What“ the point in screaming
aloud now, sister-in-law Laxmi?

167
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,958
He's committed such a big
Crime, now he's in big trouble.

168
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:49,625
Once you get arrested my sister-in-law will
go crazy strolling in these halls all alone.

169
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:53,541
Mhatre, he didn't even think
what will happen to the kid...

170
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:54,875
...and sister-in-law
when he's in jail.

171
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:55,875
You're there.

172
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:01,333
I mean...you're there to
save us from this trouble.

173
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:04,125
Take my advice, sir.

174
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,375
You should settle this matter
right here with some money.

175
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:11,208
Brother, just a minute.

176
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,666
I was saying...let's settle this...

177
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,875
- Hey...
- Brother,

178
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:22,208
think about my son Kalpesh.

179
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:25,250
Or, just listen to
your sister-in-law Laxmi.

180
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:29,708
Please!

181
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:33,750
I can never say no to Laxmi.

182
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,333
Don't mind sir,
but can I say something?

183
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:43,291
We're thugs, thieves, and cons.

184
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:47,500
But I've never come across
a notorious thug like you.

185
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:52,375
Dagdu, tell me something I don't know.

186
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,208
This is the 21st century.

187
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,250
People have only one interest.

188
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:00,875
Their own.

189
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:04,000
"Here comes Simmba."

190
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:33,458
"Simmba..."

191
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:35,500
"Machinga-Machinga..."

192
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:37,125
"Listen to the drums beat."

193
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:40,250
"Watch me groove to the beat.

194
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:41,875
"Groove..."

195
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:43,541
"Groove to the beat."

196
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:45,166
"Machinga-Machinga..."

197
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,875
"Listen to the drums beat."

198
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:49,875
"Watch me groove to the beat.

199
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,750
"Here comes your sweetheart."

200
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,166
"Come dance with me."

201
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,125
"Forgetting about the rest."

202
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:57,166
"Here comes..."

203
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,500
"Here comes Simmba
to take you on a ride."

204
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:03,666
"Here comes..."

205
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:06,458
"Here comes Simmba
to drive you up the tree."

206
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:22,125
"Melody."

207
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,916
"One is to two...two is to four..."

208
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:40,958
"...everyone's going to shake
a leg with my sweetheart."

209
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:47,375
"Three is to nine...nice
is to twelve."

210
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:50,625
"He's the apple of everyone's eye.“

211
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,541
"Here comes your sweetheart."

212
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:53,916
"Come dance with me."

213
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:56,583
"Forgetting about the rest."

214
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:04,250
"Here comes..."

215
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,500
"Here comes Simmba
to drive you up the tree."

216
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:21,708
"Here comes Simmba."

217
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:32,583
Neha.

218
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,000
- Brother.
- How are you?

219
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,750
I am fine.
How about you?

220
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:36,666
Where's your father?

221
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:37,875
Father will be here shortly.

222
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:39,083
Take a seat until then.

223
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:41,208
What do you keep studying all day?

224
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:42,875
My exams are around the corner.

225
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,125
I'll have to study.

226
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,000
Why didn't you say that before?

227
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:48,125
I'll oust your exam papers.

228
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:49,833
Brother, oust my papers?

229
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:53,625
- Simmba, what are you saying?
- Brother...it was just a joke.

230
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,125
You say, why call me so urgently?

231
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,125
Neha, tell your mother to serve food.

232
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,250
I wanted to speak with you urgently.

233
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,375
I am transferring you from
Shivgadh to Miramar Police Station.

234
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:05,000
Miramar.

235
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,875
Mind blowing, brother.
Miramar is a gold mine.

236
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:11,708
Yes, yes, do as you please,
but you must listen to me carefully.

237
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:16,500
You must stay wary of the man who got
the previous inspector transferred.

238
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:17,750
You must be careful.

239
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:19,000
He's an important man.

240
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,250
Durva Ranade.

241
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:25,000
You can say that Goa's pretty much
know for him, and not the other way.

242
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:29,250
He runs an illegal business
but never crosses anyone's path.

243
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:32,250
But if someone crosses his path,
he doesn't live to tell.

244
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:36,125
80 never cross Durva Ranade's path.

245
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:39,625
Durva Ranade, my God.

246
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,750
I exist because he does.

247
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:43,583
Miramar.

248
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:14,625
Sir...

249
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,625
Sir...

250
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:16,750
Sir...

251
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,750
- Sir. Inspector Santos!"- Tawde.
- Tawde.

252
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:20,750
- Sir, AIok Borkar.
- Borkar.

253
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,500
Very good, very good.

254
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:22,500
I have a question.

255
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:23,875
Who is she?

256
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:27,625
Her?

257
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,833
<i>That's Net Aunty.</i>

258
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,500
65 complete, 66 running.

259
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:31,625
Not on your left,

260
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,125
who is that on the right?

261
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,625
You mean her.

262
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:37,500
That's Shagun.

263
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:39,125
She runs the Good
Food Catering Service.

264
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:44,541
Man, Miramar is already mind-blowing.

265
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:45,375
Thank you, sir.

266
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,500
Well, now that I am here,
We might as well do some work.

267
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:49,083
Sir...

268
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:50,083
That's the control room.

269
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:51,375
Your cabin's right in front.

270
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:54,625
From Dona Paula to Panjim, five
beat-stations come under our Police Station.

271
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,583
- How many cameras?
- Just one?

272
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,000
- And in my cabin?
- None.

273
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,375
- Mind-blowing.
- Thank you, sir.

274
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,625
Head Constable Nityanand Mohile.

275
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,083
Won't you salute your senior?

276
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:19,583
My hands hurting.

277
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,875
I know where it's really hurting you.

278
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,750
I've heard a lot about you, Mohile.

279
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,500
Even I ...have heard
a lot about you, sir.

280
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:32,083
Ohh...taunt.

281
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:34,125
But...

282
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,750
"The day shall come..."

283
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,333
"...when you'll raise your hand."

284
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:43,458
"Salute me."

285
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:48,875
“And...salute me every
time I come and go."

286
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,750
Mohile, since you're
giving me such a dry look...

287
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:54,625
...you're now my driver.

288
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:55,750
You will drive my car.

289
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:58,458
You see...even my hands hurting.

290
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:01,458
Honestly.

291
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,250
Sir, this way.

292
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:05,916
- Tawde.
- Yes, sir.

293
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:09,125
- Anything to eat?
- Well, sir, that's up to you.

294
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,000
I was talking about food.

295
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:15,750
Sir, I'll treat you to some great food,
and you won't stop licking your fingers.

296
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:19,000
Come on, lunch break.

297
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,916
Tawde brother. Wash your hands.

298
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:22,500
Of course. Of course.

299
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:23,541
Enough, Mohile uncle.

300
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:24,375
Work later.

301
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:25,125
It's a lunch break.

302
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:28,125
- How are you, Shagun?
- All well.

303
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,000
Your lunch box.

304
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:33,750
By the way, there's good news for you.

305
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:34,500
What?

306
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,083
No sweets for you anymore.

307
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:36,958
Why?

308
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,458
Why? because Nandini called me.

309
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:43,000
She was saying that the doctor has
increased your dosage for diabetes.

310
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:44,333
And you didn't tell me.

311
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:45,958
And so, no more sweets for you.

312
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:50,125
That Nandini is more like
my mother than my daughter.

313
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,125
Are you complaining?

314
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,000
Eat your lunch.

315
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:58,750
Iyer aunty, you forgot to
put fish in the fish curry again.

316
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,833
I forgot.

317
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:02,750
Look carefully, it must be in there.

318
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:06,208
Aunty, this is my lunch box and not the
ocean where I'll have to find the fish.

319
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:11,250
Borkar uncle, why are you laughing?

320
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:13,875
Aunty called me too.

321
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:17,208
And she said that you're
on a strict diet from today.

322
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,500
80 only salad for you.

323
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,250
This is not fair.

324
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:22,500
Only salad.

325
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,125
- Your bloody aunty...
- Uncle.

326
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:26,166
Please don't do this.

327
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:27,625
I'll get you an iPhone.

328
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:31,375
Borkar uncle, are you bribing me?

329
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,083
Borkar?

330
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,083
What did you just say?

331
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:40,625
Never talk about bribe's in this
Police Station again, understand?

332
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,625
- Hello.

333
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:46,250
I am Sangram Bhalerao,
the new Station In-charge.

334
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:49,250
But you can call me Simmba.

335
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:53,416
Well, I run the Good
Food Catering Service.

336
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:55,250
I know...l was looking you.

337
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:57,875
- What?
- I mean I saw you. I did.

338
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:00,625
So then, let us worry
about your food as well.

339
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:01,500
That's good.

340
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,750
Because our sir has a good appetite.

341
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:06,750
That's a good thing.

342
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,083
Don't you want to eat?

343
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,000
- Your name?
- Shagun.

344
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:16,625
- Tell me when.
- What?

345
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:19,541
I mean you don't need permission.

346
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:22,000
If you have any problem,
come directly to me.

347
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:25,625
And anyway...I'll be
indebted to you from today.

348
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:28,541
Okay.

349
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:30,000
- See you.
- Okay.

350
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:33,208
Uncle...no sweets.

351
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:35,041
<i>Jaws.
- Yes.</i>

352
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:36,125
What is this going on?

353
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,500
Dabbang Meets Hum Aapke Hain Kaun.

354
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:40,583
Sir, it's a 25-year-old story.

355
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:44,625
Shagun's father, Vishwash Sathe,
was a dashing encounter specialist.

356
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:47,000
He was posted in our Police Station.

357
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,375
Shagun's mother started a new
catering business right next to us.

358
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:51,083
She used to get lunch
for sir every day.

359
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:54,000
They fell in love,
then got married, and Shagun happened.

360
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:57,083
But sister-in-law passed away
when Shagun was only 4-years-old.

361
00:22:58,375 --> 00:22:59,750
And Vishwas Sathe,
did he get transferred?

362
00:22:59,916 --> 00:23:00,625
No, sir.

363
00:23:01,416 --> 00:23:03,833
Sir died in a shootout
three years ago.

364
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,375
Ohh...meaning Shagun
and I are same to same.

365
00:23:08,791 --> 00:23:09,625
We are both orphans.

366
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:10,750
That's great, sir.

367
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:13,583
Tawde, this is mind-blowing.

368
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:16,083
I think history is
going to repeat itself.

369
00:23:16,416 --> 00:23:20,333
Shagun will someday
lose her heart to me.

370
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:23,750
<i>Abba-D abba-Chabba...</i>

371
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:25,750
Definitely, sir.

372
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:28,083
And, I am made-to-order for Shagun.

373
00:23:28,291 --> 00:23:30,166
I am dashing like her father.

374
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:30,791
Daring.

375
00:23:30,791 --> 00:23:32,250
And a Police Officer.

376
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:33,333
Correct, sir.

377
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:36,875
And her father even laid
down his life in the line of duty.

378
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,708
Why did you spoil my mood, Mohile?

379
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:41,250
Anyway.

380
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:43,375
<i>Jaws.</i>

381
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:45,125
- Food's been arranged.
- Sir.

382
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:47,083
- Evan found a lilb-parlner.
- Slr.

383
00:23:47,416 --> 00:23:49,000
- And a Police Station too.
- Sir.

384
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:51,125
This is nothing short of a gold mine.

385
00:23:51,791 --> 00:23:54,375
And now all the gold will be mine.

386
00:23:54,541 --> 00:23:55,500
Definitely, sir.

387
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:58,458
Do one thing...bring me
all the files of Durva Ranade.

388
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:00,500
Why Durva Ranade, sir?

389
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:04,500
Because in the next 24 hours we're
going to shut down all his pubs...

390
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:10,208
...illegal construction sites,
and unofficial business.

391
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:16,125
Durva Ranade should know
that Sangram Bhalerao has arrived...

392
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:19,000
...in Miramar Police Station.

393
00:24:52,916 --> 00:24:55,000
Boss. The kids.

394
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:56,125
Hey...

395
00:25:56,916 --> 00:25:59,375
Go directly to where I told you to go.

396
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,333
Don't stop if anyone
tries to stop you.

397
00:26:01,916 --> 00:26:03,541
And no need to worry, it's okay.

398
00:26:03,541 --> 00:26:04,083
Understand.

399
00:26:04,291 --> 00:26:05,125
Boss.

400
00:26:05,625 --> 00:26:06,083
Police.

401
00:26:06,916 --> 00:26:07,625
What the...

402
00:26:07,916 --> 00:26:09,125
Vicky, get the kids out of here.

403
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,500
Sada, let's go.

404
00:26:14,291 --> 00:26:16,500
My dear brothers and their sisters.

405
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,958
You see, the clock's struck 12.

406
00:26:19,125 --> 00:26:24,708
And before Simmba loses his temper,
make yourself scarce.

407
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,750
Sir...what a dialogue.

408
00:26:26,916 --> 00:26:28,000
Talent, man.

409
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:29,125
Excuse me, sir.

410
00:26:29,125 --> 00:26:30,416
Why did you turn off the music?

411
00:26:30,416 --> 00:26:31,708
What seems to be the problem?

412
00:26:32,666 --> 00:26:34,000
English.

413
00:26:38,791 --> 00:26:40,000
Yeah, what did you say?

414
00:26:40,416 --> 00:26:41,500
Why did you turn off the music?

415
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:46,208
Because...l didn't like your face.

416
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,500
Hey...have you lost your mind,
Inspector.

417
00:26:49,916 --> 00:26:51,125
You don't who we are.

418
00:26:52,541 --> 00:26:55,083
This Pub belongs to Durva
Ranade and we are his brothers.

419
00:26:55,541 --> 00:26:56,250
So?

420
00:26:57,041 --> 00:26:58,500
Should I look excited?

421
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:02,000
Don't you know its illegal
to keep the pubs open after 12?

422
00:27:03,041 --> 00:27:03,958
Are you new around here?

423
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:06,333
We made a deal with
the local area in charge.

424
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,125
You will regret this, inspector.

425
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:10,125
Don't look horns with us.

426
00:27:10,291 --> 00:27:11,625
Tell me something I don't know.

427
00:27:12,541 --> 00:27:14,000
Tell me something I don't know.

428
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:19,375
And yes, don't forget
to tell your brother Durva...

429
00:27:20,541 --> 00:27:21,875
What?

430
00:27:22,041 --> 00:27:23,125
"Here comes..."

431
00:27:23,291 --> 00:27:25,000
"Here comes Simmba."

432
00:27:28,541 --> 00:27:31,833
Gandhiji saved this country
using truth and honesty.

433
00:27:32,625 --> 00:27:36,500
Gandhiji's full name as
Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.

434
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:38,833
What are you doing nitin?

435
00:27:39,166 --> 00:27:41,833
Gandhiji spells with 'hi'.

436
00:27:42,666 --> 00:27:43,375
That's correct.

437
00:27:43,541 --> 00:27:45,625
No one dared to shut
down our business.

438
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:46,875
And that blood cop...

439
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:48,833
God knows who he thinks he is.

440
00:27:49,041 --> 00:27:50,375
You should've been there brother...

441
00:27:53,791 --> 00:27:55,125
We should break that bloody cops legs!

442
00:27:56,791 --> 00:27:58,875
Next time I see him around,
I will bash him.

443
00:27:58,875 --> 00:28:00,125


444
00:28:01,541 --> 00:28:03,125
Don't talk like that
in front of the child.

445
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,625
I've said it a thousand times before.

446
00:28:07,041 --> 00:28:08,375
Nitin, come here son.

447
00:28:08,375 --> 00:28:09,500
Come to me, son.

448
00:28:11,916 --> 00:28:14,250
Brother, he has closed
down all our other business.

449
00:28:14,541 --> 00:28:17,958
Dutta sir said he's
sending someone useful, but...

450
00:28:24,041 --> 00:28:24,875
Call Dutta...

451
00:28:25,125 --> 00:28:26,750
No need to call.

452
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Sangram Bhalerao aka Simmba,
reporting.

453
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:33,041
Look what I brought for you, Bhau.

454
00:28:33,041 --> 00:28:34,125
Can I call you Bhau?

455
00:28:34,416 --> 00:28:38,291
There are more than 5000
evergreen songs on this.

456
00:28:38,291 --> 00:28:38,958
Look.

457
00:28:39,666 --> 00:28:40,875
Hold it, Bhau.

458
00:28:43,166 --> 00:28:45,333
Hello, brother from another mother.

459
00:28:45,916 --> 00:28:47,208
Why so serious?

460
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,541
Don't stress.

461
00:28:48,541 --> 00:28:50,000
Have a chewing gum instead.

462
00:28:51,041 --> 00:28:52,000
You too.

463
00:28:52,166 --> 00:28:54,250
I am all out of it.

464
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:59,041
Nitin! Look what Simmba
uncle got for you.

465
00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:01,625
Imported SmartWatch for a smart boy.

466
00:29:01,791 --> 00:29:03,291
Isn't it? mind-blowing.

467
00:29:03,291 --> 00:29:07,125
Sister-in-law,
brand new Paitani sari for you.

468
00:29:07,291 --> 00:29:10,083
A cup of tea, less milk, more cream.

469
00:29:12,291 --> 00:29:14,583
Aunty, greetings.

470
00:29:14,875 --> 00:29:17,333
I heard that you're
suffering from knee pain.

471
00:29:17,666 --> 00:29:18,875
It goes like...

472
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,125
"There's a pain in the knee..."

473
00:29:21,541 --> 00:29:23,583
"There's a pain in the knee..."

474
00:29:23,916 --> 00:29:25,250
"...and I have a problem getting up."

475
00:29:26,541 --> 00:29:27,875
Aunty, this is what I got for you.

476
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:29,000
Latest Ayurvedic oil.

477
00:29:29,166 --> 00:29:30,375
Massage two times
a day for 11 minutes...

478
00:29:30,375 --> 00:29:32,750
...and you'll walk as fast as I talk.

479
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:38,000
- What a lovely family, God bless them...
- Are you done with your drama

480
00:29:39,166 --> 00:29:40,375
This is not a Charade.

481
00:29:40,916 --> 00:29:42,500
This is a family after all,
and I am an orphan...

482
00:29:42,666 --> 00:29:44,375
...so I showed some brotherly love.

483
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:45,750
And closed down your
brother's business.

484
00:29:45,916 --> 00:29:47,250
No...I'll tell you why.

485
00:29:47,416 --> 00:29:51,458
Sister-in-law, what was the
price of onions three months ago?

486
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:53,000
70 rupees.

487
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,000
And what is it now?

488
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:54,875
100 rupees.

489
00:29:55,166 --> 00:29:55,625
See...

490
00:29:56,416 --> 00:29:57,875
Inflation is touching the sky.

491
00:29:58,041 --> 00:30:00,625
If you look at it percentage wise,
the price of onions has gone up 30%.

492
00:30:00,625 --> 00:30:03,208
So even we deserve an
uplifiment in our rate card.

493
00:30:04,041 --> 00:30:05,625
Day-to-day expenses
are getting hard to handle.

494
00:30:05,791 --> 00:30:07,625
I only did it to grab your attention.

495
00:30:07,791 --> 00:30:10,041
I'll open it...I'll open
everything back again.

496
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:11,250
I'm your younger brother.

497
00:30:11,416 --> 00:30:14,875
From today...you have three brothers,
and not two.

498
00:30:15,041 --> 00:30:17,250
Tell me, sister-in-law, how
many brothers-in-law do you have now?

499
00:30:17,666 --> 00:30:18,250
Three.

500
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,583
Three. See, Bhau.

501
00:30:19,791 --> 00:30:21,250
You're a big rascal.

502
00:30:21,791 --> 00:30:24,708
Bhau, tell me something I don't know.

503
00:30:24,875 --> 00:30:26,125
Tell me something I don't know.

504
00:30:26,916 --> 00:30:27,708
You're like a fire-cracker.

505
00:30:28,291 --> 00:30:29,583
Someday you'll cause a big explosion.

506
00:30:29,916 --> 00:30:32,375
Someone said this to me long ago.

507
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:33,750
Who?

508
00:30:36,625 --> 00:30:37,625
I'll tell you some other day.

509
00:30:38,666 --> 00:30:39,333
Bhalerao.

510
00:30:40,291 --> 00:30:42,625
Even you remind me of someone.

511
00:30:43,125 --> 00:30:44,208
Really? Who?

512
00:30:44,541 --> 00:30:46,708
Your sister-in-law's brother.

513
00:30:47,041 --> 00:30:47,625
Keshav.

514
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:48,750
Really?

515
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,625
<i>Same</i> to same.

516
00:30:49,791 --> 00:30:50,833
Exactly same to same.

517
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:52,333
He was a good kid.

518
00:30:52,791 --> 00:30:55,708
But...he died.

519
00:30:56,541 --> 00:30:58,125
- How?
- I killed him.

520
00:31:02,791 --> 00:31:06,375
You see, he tried to
double-cross me in business.

521
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:10,750
You won't do it, will you?

522
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:14,375
No Bhau, why will I do such a thing?

523
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:18,750
Look Bhalerao, I have a rule.

524
00:31:19,916 --> 00:31:21,458
I never cross anyone's path.

525
00:31:22,375 --> 00:31:25,208
But if someone crosses mine,
they don't live to tell.

526
00:31:27,291 --> 00:31:28,625
You have a service revolver,
don't you?

527
00:31:29,416 --> 00:31:31,250
If someday you think
about double crossing me...

528
00:31:32,125 --> 00:31:33,333
...you can shoot yourself.

529
00:31:33,875 --> 00:31:35,000
Don't bother me.

530
00:31:37,416 --> 00:31:38,125
Scared?

531
00:31:40,291 --> 00:31:42,375
You're a mischievous kid.

532
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,958
You know what, don't forget to drink tea
your sister-in-law's prepared for you.

533
00:31:47,541 --> 00:31:48,125
Go on.

534
00:31:56,291 --> 00:31:59,583
Did he see you two
in the pub with drugs?

535
00:32:00,291 --> 00:32:00,875
No, brother.

536
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,250
- Do we tell him?
- Not yet.

537
00:32:07,791 --> 00:32:08,875
He's a bloody rascal.

538
00:32:10,041 --> 00:32:11,333
We can't trust him yet.

539
00:32:16,416 --> 00:32:17,125
Find anything?

540
00:32:19,666 --> 00:32:20,375
Nothing.

541
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:24,000
Look, Arjun, don't lie to me.

542
00:32:24,166 --> 00:32:26,500
Chotu saw you guys carrying
drugs in your school bags.

543
00:32:27,416 --> 00:32:29,125
Are they paying you for doing this?

544
00:32:29,291 --> 00:32:30,625
It's not what you think, sister.

545
00:32:30,791 --> 00:32:31,875
Chotu is lying.

546
00:32:34,875 --> 00:32:37,375
- Are you two doing drugs?
- No, sister.

547
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:40,625
Look, don't be scared.

548
00:32:40,916 --> 00:32:43,125
Tell me who is making you do this.

549
00:32:43,125 --> 00:32:44,625
I don't know anything, sister.

550
00:32:46,291 --> 00:32:49,125
Akriti, Chotu could
be mistaken as well.

551
00:32:49,541 --> 00:32:50,750
What's wrong, Akriti?

552
00:32:52,916 --> 00:32:54,333
Nothing, father.

553
00:32:54,875 --> 00:32:55,875
Where's my dinner?

554
00:32:56,791 --> 00:32:58,083
Dinner is ready at home.

555
00:32:58,291 --> 00:32:59,875
You two 90 home and eat.

556
00:33:00,166 --> 00:33:02,625
- But father...
- You two have completely forgotten...

557
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:04,708
...about your own studies
while tutoring these kids.

558
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,125
Go home and eat your dinner,
and focus on your own studies.

559
00:33:08,416 --> 00:33:09,875
I'll tutor the kids.

560
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,583
Akriti, I think you're overreacting.

561
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:20,125
Don't stress yourself.

562
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,875
Kavya, I know these kids are lying.

563
00:33:23,791 --> 00:33:26,083
And, I think I know
who is behind all this.

564
00:33:26,416 --> 00:33:29,625
The people behind all
this can be very dangerous.

565
00:33:30,416 --> 00:33:32,833
I really don't think
you should get into this mess.

566
00:33:33,041 --> 00:33:35,500
No. I won't let them ruin their lives.

567
00:33:36,666 --> 00:33:39,583
In fact, I'll go down to the Police
Station tomorrow and file a complaint.

568
00:33:46,041 --> 00:33:47,375
I am off to the check-post.

569
00:33:48,541 --> 00:33:51,083
Excuse me,
I wanted to file a complaint.

570
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,500
<i>Jaws.
- Yes.</i>

571
00:33:52,666 --> 00:33:53,500
Please assist her.

572
00:33:55,416 --> 00:33:57,458
Come. Sit.

573
00:33:58,041 --> 00:33:59,375
Borkar, I am hungry.

574
00:33:59,375 --> 00:34:01,750
Go check what my Shagun
made for breakfast.

575
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:02,708
Yes, sir.

576
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:05,500
Sir, I wanted to file a complaint.

577
00:34:06,375 --> 00:34:07,916
Sir, my name is Akriti Dave.

578
00:34:07,916 --> 00:34:09,625
- I wanted to file a complaint...
- Aren't you a teacher?

579
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:11,250
Sir.

580
00:34:11,541 --> 00:34:13,750
- No, sir, I am a medical student.
- Sit.

581
00:34:14,041 --> 00:34:16,000
And, I practice at
the government hospital.

582
00:34:16,166 --> 00:34:18,875
But whenever I get some spare time,
I tutor orphans too.

583
00:34:18,875 --> 00:34:21,625
Yes, I saw you the other
day tutoring the kids.

584
00:34:22,041 --> 00:34:22,791
Do you have a complaint?

585
00:34:22,791 --> 00:34:24,000
- Tell me about it.
- Yes, sir.

586
00:34:24,291 --> 00:34:28,375
Actually, some of the children that I tutor
have been turned into drug carriers.

587
00:34:28,916 --> 00:34:31,750
They smuggle drugs by putting
them into children's school bag.

588
00:34:33,416 --> 00:34:34,458
Drugs in my area?

589
00:34:35,791 --> 00:34:36,750
Who is doing it?

590
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:37,875
I've no idea, sir.

591
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:41,833
Sir, I think Durva Ranade's brothers
Sadashiv and Gaurav Ranade are behind it.

592
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,875
There are often late
night parties in their pub.

593
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:47,208
And I have a doubt that they
carry out their drug business there.

594
00:34:47,916 --> 00:34:51,375
When I ask my students, they
don't tell me anything out of fear.

595
00:34:51,666 --> 00:34:53,916
And yes,
the hospital where I practice...

596
00:34:53,916 --> 00:34:56,875
...we often treat young
people addicted to drugs.

597
00:34:57,166 --> 00:35:00,208
These drugs are easily
available everywhere.

598
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:03,500
Sir, please help me out.

599
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,208
Okay, I'll start an inquiry,
I'll look into it.

600
00:35:07,916 --> 00:35:09,125
Okay, sir. Thank you.

601
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,083
- What is your name?
- Akriti Dave.

602
00:35:12,375 --> 00:35:13,250
Akriti...

603
00:35:13,791 --> 00:35:15,833
You remind me of my own teacher.

604
00:35:16,041 --> 00:35:16,875
Gayatri Devi.

605
00:35:17,291 --> 00:35:19,500
She used to tutor me on the footpath,
just like you do.

606
00:35:19,791 --> 00:35:21,375
She was like an older sister to me.

607
00:35:22,541 --> 00:35:26,083
Well, I can't be your older sister sir,
but think of me as your younger sister.

608
00:35:28,291 --> 00:35:29,750
I'll look into your matter.

609
00:35:29,916 --> 00:35:30,875
Don't worry. Go.

610
00:35:31,166 --> 00:35:32,000
Thank you, sir.

611
00:35:36,666 --> 00:35:42,000
Listen, Akriti. If you ever have
any problem in life, then call me.

612
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:44,000
Okay.

613
00:35:44,166 --> 00:35:47,375
If I ever have any problem in life,
I will call you first.

614
00:35:50,416 --> 00:35:51,000
Pawar.

615
00:35:51,666 --> 00:35:52,750
Give her my number.

616
00:35:53,291 --> 00:35:53,875
Yes, sir.

617
00:35:54,916 --> 00:35:56,250
<i>Jaws.</i>

618
00:35:56,541 --> 00:35:58,500
- What is the lesson in all this?
- What, sir.

619
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,458
Durva Ranade is playing
hide-n-seek with us.

620
00:36:01,666 --> 00:36:02,625
Yes, sir.

621
00:36:02,625 --> 00:36:04,791
He didn't tell us
about his main business.

622
00:36:04,791 --> 00:36:05,625
- Sir...
- Yes.

623
00:36:05,625 --> 00:36:07,000
Trouble in Good Food.

624
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:09,375
- Hit him. Hit him.
- Don't be scared.

625
00:36:10,666 --> 00:36:12,458
Wait. Wait.

626
00:36:12,625 --> 00:36:13,750
I said wait!

627
00:36:13,916 --> 00:36:16,000
Stop beating him to a pulp, man.

628
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,791
Shagun. Shagun. wait.

629
00:36:17,791 --> 00:36:18,583
What are you doing?

630
00:36:18,791 --> 00:36:19,458
I am there.

631
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:21,875
Tell me what is a problem.

632
00:36:21,875 --> 00:36:26,750
This guy here stares at Purnima,
stalks her and troubles here.

633
00:36:26,916 --> 00:36:28,833
You bloody...

634
00:36:31,416 --> 00:36:32,750
Hey...

635
00:36:33,541 --> 00:36:35,333
I truly love Purnima.

636
00:36:35,666 --> 00:36:36,750
What is he saying?

637
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:38,250
My love for her is so true
that I can even give my life for her.

638
00:36:42,125 --> 00:36:42,833
Shagun...

639
00:36:43,166 --> 00:36:45,125
You relax, I'll deal with him.

640
00:36:45,125 --> 00:36:46,791
Uncle, your cutlery.

641
00:36:46,791 --> 00:36:48,375
You go, I'll deal with him.

642
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,333
Bye, Shagun. I'll deal with him.

643
00:36:52,291 --> 00:36:53,500
So, what is your name?

644
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:54,666
Purab, sir.

645
00:36:54,666 --> 00:36:56,000
Why do you trouble girls?

646
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,375
You bloody...

647
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:00,250
Sir, I had no "I
intentions towards her, sir.

648
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:03,250
An intention is just another intention,
there's nothing good or bad about it.

649
00:37:03,416 --> 00:37:06,541
Intentions don't carry a plaque
saying today I am good or bad.

650
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:07,375
They don't.

651
00:37:07,916 --> 00:37:09,458
We'll have to make a case against you.

652
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:10,250
Sir...

653
00:37:10,416 --> 00:37:11,958
You'll be doing time
in jail for pretty long.

654
00:37:12,541 --> 00:37:14,375
Sir, isn't there a
way to get out of this?

655
00:37:14,375 --> 00:37:15,041
Look at that.

656
00:37:15,041 --> 00:37:16,916
You're the driver and
you're asking me for the way.

657
00:37:16,916 --> 00:37:18,333
You bloody...

658
00:37:19,166 --> 00:37:22,458
Even if I listen to you,
and don't file a case against you...

659
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,333
- ...then will you help me.
- Of course, I will, sir.

660
00:37:25,666 --> 00:37:26,375
Look Purab.

661
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:28,500
Not the East Look at me.

662
00:37:29,375 --> 00:37:30,500
Actually...

663
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:33,375
I also love her.

664
00:37:34,375 --> 00:37:35,541
Don't you dare set
eyes on my Purnima...

665
00:37:35,541 --> 00:37:37,250
Not Purnima,
I mean my Shagun.

666
00:37:37,416 --> 00:37:38,500
You bloody...

667
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,750
Her friend Shagun.

668
00:37:40,041 --> 00:37:42,625
And only you can bring us together.

669
00:37:43,375 --> 00:37:44,083
How is that?

670
00:37:44,541 --> 00:37:47,375
Looking at your actions,
I can sniff the rascal inside you.

671
00:37:47,916 --> 00:37:50,208
Come, I'll tell you what to do.

672
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,625
- Hello.
- Purab speaking.

673
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,750
Purab.

674
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:01,333
You must be wondering how I
got from in the cell to on the cell.

675
00:38:04,291 --> 00:38:05,250
I broke out.

676
00:38:05,666 --> 00:38:06,708
Do you know why?

677
00:38:07,041 --> 00:38:10,875
Because whoever comes between
Purnima and me deserves to die.

678
00:38:11,541 --> 00:38:14,000
And if you don't believe me,
then look outside your window.

679
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,625
Right now!

680
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,500
What happened, Shagun?

681
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:25,750
Aunty, that Purab's standing
outside the house and threatening me.

682
00:38:26,041 --> 00:38:27,333
I'll deal with him.

683
00:38:28,041 --> 00:38:28,833
Wait. Wait.

684
00:38:29,291 --> 00:38:30,208
Don't go outside.

685
00:38:30,416 --> 00:38:32,375
You know what, call Simmba.

686
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:35,625
It's ringing. It's ringing.

687
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,541
- Hello.
- HI Simmba. Shagun here.

688
00:38:39,541 --> 00:38:41,500
Hi Shagun, how you are?

689
00:38:41,666 --> 00:38:46,500
Simmba, that Purab's broken out of jail
and is outside my house threatening me.

690
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:47,500
Pu rab?

691
00:38:47,791 --> 00:38:48,583
Purab who?

692
00:38:48,916 --> 00:38:50,583
That rickshaw driver?

693
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:52,625
Yes, that rickshaw driver.

694
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:54,750
Don't worry, Shagun.

695
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:57,625
Simmba is on the way.
I am there.

696
00:38:57,625 --> 00:38:58,750
Ting-tong.

697
00:39:01,166 --> 00:39:03,500
- Simmba?
- Shagun, here I am.

698
00:39:03,666 --> 00:39:05,000
You came over so quickly.

699
00:39:05,166 --> 00:39:07,250
What...this is unbelievable.

700
00:39:07,791 --> 00:39:09,500
If the Police come's before time,
people still complain.

701
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:11,625
If the Police arrives late,
people complain.

702
00:39:11,625 --> 00:39:13,875
I don't know what to do?

703
00:39:13,875 --> 00:39:15,833
By the way, there is no one outside.

704
00:39:16,791 --> 00:39:18,833
He must have seen you and hidden.

705
00:39:19,416 --> 00:39:21,375
Nice house. Very decent.

706
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:23,083


707
00:39:23,291 --> 00:39:25,500
- I'll cook something.
- Shagun. Shagun.

708
00:39:25,916 --> 00:39:27,375
That's all you do all day.

709
00:39:27,666 --> 00:39:29,208
I'll cook dinner tonight.

710
00:39:30,625 --> 00:39:35,000
- Wow...you make perfect mound Rofls (bread).
- Obviously.

711
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,458
I have a masters
degree in making rotis.

712
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,875
There was a Gurdwara
(Shrine) back in Shivgadh.

713
00:39:39,041 --> 00:39:41,125
And they used to distribute
free food every Sunday.

714
00:39:41,125 --> 00:39:42,833
And cooking Rotis was my duty.

715
00:39:43,041 --> 00:39:44,125
100 rotis in one hour.

716
00:39:44,291 --> 00:39:46,291
All the aunties were impressed.

717
00:39:46,291 --> 00:39:47,083
I see...

718
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:48,125
What about the girls?

719
00:39:48,666 --> 00:39:50,583
Weren't they impressed?

720
00:39:51,291 --> 00:39:53,875
- I used to feel...
- What?

721
00:39:54,791 --> 00:39:56,041
...feel coy to talk to girls.

722
00:39:56,041 --> 00:39:58,375
I see...but you're
quite brazen with me.

723
00:39:59,791 --> 00:40:01,000
You are completely different.

724
00:40:03,791 --> 00:40:04,958
Sir, how is it going?

725
00:40:05,166 --> 00:40:06,000
All well.

726
00:40:06,166 --> 00:40:09,375
Sir, I feel you won't come out before
getting married and having some kids.

727
00:40:09,541 --> 00:40:11,000
Should I look for school admissions?

728
00:40:11,291 --> 00:40:12,000
What?

729
00:40:12,416 --> 00:40:13,833
He got scared and ran away.

730
00:40:14,291 --> 00:40:15,083
Exactly.

731
00:40:15,666 --> 00:40:17,625
Even if I have to
stay awake all night,

732
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:20,208
Shagun is absolutely
safe as long as I am here.

733
00:40:21,916 --> 00:40:24,041
Ohh...how cute.

734
00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:25,125
Tawde, hang up.

735
00:40:26,666 --> 00:40:27,833
Cute...

736
00:40:29,416 --> 00:40:31,250
- HI, Shagun.
- HI...

737
00:40:32,916 --> 00:40:35,541
Dhiraj, your new haircut
is looking really cute.

738
00:40:35,541 --> 00:40:36,500
- You like it.
- Love it.

739
00:40:36,666 --> 00:40:37,625
I just got it yesterday.

740
00:40:37,791 --> 00:40:40,625
Simmba, this is Dhiraj.
He's my best friend.

741
00:40:40,625 --> 00:40:42,958
And Dhiraj,
this is inspector Bhalerao.

742
00:40:43,166 --> 00:40:44,000
- Hello.

743
00:40:44,166 --> 00:40:47,375
Some stalker rickshaw driver
called Purab was bothering me.

744
00:40:47,375 --> 00:40:49,083
That's why Simmba came to help.

745
00:40:49,666 --> 00:40:52,125
- That's really sweet.
- Okay, okay.

746
00:40:52,791 --> 00:40:54,750
- Remember our picture on the roller coaster.
- Yeah...

747
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:55,833
Do you know how many 'Likes' it got?

748
00:40:57,125 --> 00:40:58,583
250 Likes and you're happy.

749
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,125
She is such a coward.

750
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:03,125
As soon as she got on the roller
coaster, she grabbed my arm like this...

751
00:41:03,291 --> 00:41:04,125
...and closed her eyes.

752
00:41:04,125 --> 00:41:05,125
I can't tell you.

753
00:41:11,666 --> 00:41:15,458
And after we came out, she
was so scared that she wasn't eating.

754
00:41:15,916 --> 00:41:18,333
I had to feed her with my hands.

755
00:41:18,666 --> 00:41:20,250
And finally, she agreed.

756
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:26,250
Nin...Ja!

757
00:41:27,291 --> 00:41:30,875
My mom's always been saying that
only we can look after each other.

758
00:41:31,125 --> 00:41:32,250
And we should get married.

759
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:33,208
Nonsense.

760
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:34,750
That's what she says.

761
00:41:35,541 --> 00:41:36,208
Not me.

762
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:42,750
- It's getting late, I should go.
- You're leaving.

763
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,333
Yeah.

764
00:41:43,791 --> 00:41:44,208
Well, see you.

765
00:41:44,416 --> 00:41:45,291


766
00:41:45,291 --> 00:41:46,125
Nice time.

767
00:41:46,291 --> 00:41:48,083
Come on. Come on, it's getting late.

768
00:41:49,541 --> 00:41:51,125
- Bye, Shagun.
- Bye, Dhiraj.

769
00:41:51,791 --> 00:41:52,750
Will you be able to go on your own?

770
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:53,458
Or will you be scared?

771
00:41:53,625 --> 00:41:54,958
Should I send a Police team with you?

772
00:41:56,166 --> 00:41:57,875
No, I am good. but you're a funny guy.

773
00:41:58,291 --> 00:41:59,333
Funny chap.

774
00:42:01,541 --> 00:42:03,375
Don't stick your hand
out of the window, son.

775
00:42:04,916 --> 00:42:07,000
- Dhiraj is so cute, isn't he?
- Yes.

776
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,500
Cute like little puppies.

777
00:42:10,666 --> 00:42:11,750
Simmba.

778
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,833
- Tell me something, Shagun.
- What?

779
00:42:15,291 --> 00:42:17,958
Is there anything
between you and Dhiraj?

780
00:42:20,041 --> 00:42:21,000
I am thinking about it.

781
00:42:27,416 --> 00:42:29,625
Even I am thinking about you.

782
00:42:30,666 --> 00:42:34,250
I am thinking a lot of things.

783
00:42:35,625 --> 00:42:37,125
Mind-blowing.

784
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,875
"Oh, God... One more remix."

785
00:43:06,791 --> 00:43:09,500
"Makes my heart skip a beat..."

786
00:43:09,875 --> 00:43:12,625
"Whistles all the while..."

787
00:43:13,916 --> 00:43:15,916
"Makes my heart skip a beat..."

788
00:43:15,916 --> 00:43:17,625
"Whistles all the while..."

789
00:43:17,791 --> 00:43:22,125
"Shows attitude in
the middle of the street."

790
00:43:22,291 --> 00:43:24,125
"Making gestures..."

791
00:43:24,125 --> 00:43:26,083
"That Gal...

792
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:29,375
"That Gal...

793
00:43:31,416 --> 00:43:33,875
"That gal winks at me."

794
00:43:33,875 --> 00:43:35,000
"Winks at me..."

795
00:43:35,166 --> 00:43:37,500
"That gal winks at me."

796
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,875
"Winks at me..."

797
00:43:38,875 --> 00:43:41,500
"That gal winks at me."

798
00:43:56,416 --> 00:44:00,125
"Follows me wherever I go."

799
00:44:00,291 --> 00:44:03,375
"Everyone wants to be my lover."

800
00:44:11,291 --> 00:44:14,625
"Follows you wherever you go."

801
00:44:15,041 --> 00:44:18,208
"I am crazy,
I want to be yours forever."

802
00:44:18,625 --> 00:44:20,875
"Whistles all the while..."

803
00:44:22,375 --> 00:44:24,208
"Shows attitude"

804
00:44:25,916 --> 00:44:27,750
"Whistles all the while,
Shows attitude ..."

805
00:44:27,916 --> 00:44:34,166
" ...calls my name out in the open."

806
00:44:34,166 --> 00:44:35,750
"Making gestures..."

807
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,375
"That guy...

808
00:44:39,666 --> 00:44:41,250
"That guy...

809
00:44:43,375 --> 00:44:45,625
"That guy winks at me."

810
00:44:45,791 --> 00:44:47,125
"Winks at me..."

811
00:44:47,125 --> 00:44:49,375
"That gal winks at me."

812
00:44:49,375 --> 00:44:50,750
"Winks at me..."

813
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:53,291
"That gal winks at me."

814
00:44:53,291 --> 00:44:55,000
"In the voice of Tusshar Kapoor..."

815
00:45:07,041 --> 00:45:09,250
"In the voice of Kumar Sanu..."

816
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:11,541
"That gal winks at me."

817
00:45:11,541 --> 00:45:12,750
"Winks at me..."

818
00:45:12,916 --> 00:45:15,250
"That gal winks at me."

819
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:16,625
"Winks at me..."

820
00:45:16,625 --> 00:45:19,333
"That gal winks at me."

821
00:45:22,125 --> 00:45:23,333
"That guy...

822
00:45:25,791 --> 00:45:26,958
"That Gal...

823
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,625
"That guy...

824
00:45:50,916 --> 00:45:53,458
Bhalerao, meet Mr. Choksi.

825
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,333
He's a close friend.

826
00:45:55,541 --> 00:45:57,125
We want an old man to vacate his land.

827
00:45:57,916 --> 00:45:58,750
In Calangute.

828
00:46:00,541 --> 00:46:02,500
Even I can get rid of him.

829
00:46:02,875 --> 00:46:08,833
But...Mr. Joshi here, the lawyer,
and Cameron sir, the Corporator...

830
00:46:09,541 --> 00:46:13,000
...said Bhalerao's there,
he'll handle the situation.

831
00:46:14,375 --> 00:46:17,125
No, how can I handle
the situation like this?

832
00:46:18,291 --> 00:46:19,666
I just got in Miramar recently.

833
00:46:19,666 --> 00:46:22,125
If the word gets out,
I'll be in trouble.

834
00:46:22,541 --> 00:46:24,833
It's a risky job, <i>can't</i> be done.

835
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:26,875
You'll get 5 million, Bhalerao.

836
00:46:27,666 --> 00:46:28,291
Done.

837
00:46:28,291 --> 00:46:29,750
Consider it done.

838
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:31,291
I didn't mean anything I said.

839
00:46:31,291 --> 00:46:35,250
Bhau, this is my first time with Mr.
Choksi and Mr. Cameron.

840
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:37,250
We just got to know each other.

841
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:38,500
Anything is possible these days.

842
00:46:38,666 --> 00:46:42,125
Secret recordings,
sting operations, etcetera.

843
00:46:42,291 --> 00:46:43,875
That's why.
Otherwise, you know...

844
00:46:46,041 --> 00:46:49,083
You know Bhalerao,
you're a big rascal.

845
00:46:49,291 --> 00:46:52,250
Bhau, tell me something I don't know.

846
00:46:52,625 --> 00:46:54,208
Tell me something I don't know.

847
00:46:54,541 --> 00:46:56,750
Mr. Waman Rao,
there's a serious problem.

848
00:46:57,625 --> 00:46:59,708
We've received a
complaint against you.

849
00:47:00,416 --> 00:47:03,375
Durva Ranade says that he has
the original documents of this land.

850
00:47:03,625 --> 00:47:06,791
And claims he owns this land and he's
going to sell it to Choksi.

851
00:47:06,791 --> 00:47:08,125
He's falsely accusing me.

852
00:47:08,541 --> 00:47:11,750
He threatened me earlier
to sell the land.

853
00:47:11,916 --> 00:47:13,250
But I didn't agree.

854
00:47:13,416 --> 00:47:15,625
And he's falsely accusing
me with fake documents.

855
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:16,875
I don't care what he did...

856
00:47:17,041 --> 00:47:20,250
...but what about the fact that there's
going to be an arrest warrant in your name?

857
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:22,958
Why have such an emotional
attachment to the land?

858
00:47:23,291 --> 00:47:25,750
But I've safe-kept that
land for my granddaughter.

859
00:47:25,916 --> 00:47:28,208
Waman Rao, try to understand.

860
00:47:28,666 --> 00:47:31,916
Once the court proceedings begin,
then you'll be long gone...

861
00:47:31,916 --> 00:47:34,750
...and your granddaughter
will be as old as you are.

862
00:47:34,916 --> 00:47:37,083
A court case means gone <i>case.</i>

863
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,666
Do you want to go to jail at this age?

864
00:47:39,666 --> 00:47:40,791
Or keep going to hearing dates.

865
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:41,500
You don't, do you?

866
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:44,625
Durva Ranade is
offering you 5 million.

867
00:47:45,041 --> 00:47:47,458
5 million is not a small amount.

868
00:47:47,666 --> 00:47:49,291
I've brought an MOU with me, sign it.

869
00:47:49,291 --> 00:47:50,208
That's the best.

870
00:47:50,916 --> 00:47:52,125
How can...l...

871
00:47:52,291 --> 00:47:55,291
Don't look horns with Durva Ranade,
Waman Rao.

872
00:47:55,291 --> 00:47:56,625
He's a dangerous man.

873
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,625
You're doing this for
your granddaughter, aren't you?

874
00:47:58,791 --> 00:48:00,375
- Yes...
- What if he abducts your granddaughter,

875
00:48:00,541 --> 00:48:02,250
...or does something unearthly.
Then what?

876
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:03,750
What's the point of this land,
and this property.

877
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:07,000
- But you're the Police...
- Even the Police can't help you then.

878
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:13,875
- Hello.
- Hello.

879
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:15,958
Someone's kidnapped
your granddaughter.

880
00:48:16,875 --> 00:48:17,750
What happened?

881
00:48:18,541 --> 00:48:19,833
She's been kidnapped, isn't she?

882
00:48:20,041 --> 00:48:21,333
I told you.

883
00:48:21,541 --> 00:48:25,416
If the heir of the property is no more,
then What's the point of this property.

884
00:48:25,416 --> 00:48:27,250
Seal the deal, and sign the papers.

885
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:29,666
I've brought the MOU. Sign the papers.

886
00:48:29,666 --> 00:48:32,041
Don't you want to
save your granddaughter?

887
00:48:32,041 --> 00:48:33,125
I've brought the papers.

888
00:48:33,125 --> 00:48:34,750
Seal the deal,
take your 5 million and be happy.

889
00:49:31,916 --> 00:49:34,500
4...5...

890
00:49:36,125 --> 00:49:37,958
What? What are you staring at, Mohile?

891
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,083
You can keep 10%.

892
00:49:40,541 --> 00:49:41,750
Enjoy.

893
00:49:42,791 --> 00:49:43,750
You're doing the wrong thing.

894
00:49:45,041 --> 00:49:46,250
Very wrong.

895
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,625
You took everything from that old man.

896
00:49:49,041 --> 00:49:52,500
He couldn't control his tears,
and you are busy counting money.

897
00:49:53,125 --> 00:49:54,250
You have no feeling.

898
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:58,375
Mohile, I became a
cop to make a fast buck...

899
00:49:58,375 --> 00:50:00,791
...and not to help others
like some Robin Hood.

900
00:50:00,791 --> 00:50:02,250
That old man got 5 million.

901
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:04,250
Do you know how much 5 million is?

902
00:50:04,541 --> 00:50:07,125
So mind your own business,
and let me do mine.

903
00:50:07,416 --> 00:50:10,125
Go ahead, sir. Yell louder.

904
00:50:11,166 --> 00:50:15,625
When a person is wrong he often
yells aloud to prove himself right.

905
00:50:15,791 --> 00:50:18,375
Mind your language, Mohile,
don't forget that I am your senior.

906
00:50:18,375 --> 00:50:21,625
And you don't forget that
you're Inspector Sangram Bhalerao...

907
00:50:21,625 --> 00:50:25,750
...who's betraying his duty
for a criminal like Durva Ranade.

908
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:29,625
What did you achieve with
your honesty in the last 25 years?

909
00:50:30,125 --> 00:50:31,958
You guys are just show offs.

910
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:34,750
And if you feel really bad,
then go and shoot Durva...

911
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:35,750
...and do some good to your country.

912
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:38,291
Otherwise, come over to my side,
make some money...

913
00:50:38,291 --> 00:50:39,750
...and do some good for your family.

914
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:44,041
Turn your attention from the
hooliganism around and focus on money.

915
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,000
You'll benefit more.

916
00:50:45,166 --> 00:50:47,250
I spit on your illegal money.

917
00:50:48,666 --> 00:50:51,000
I never wanted anything
bad for anyone yet.

918
00:50:51,416 --> 00:50:56,750
But today I pray to God
to bring about a storm, a Tsunami...

919
00:50:56,916 --> 00:51:00,000
...that sweeps you away,
and you drown in it.

920
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:03,125
Go ahead, Pray right now.

921
00:51:03,541 --> 00:51:04,958
You want a Tsunami,
then make it come now.

922
00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:07,375
Start praying. I am right here.

923
00:51:07,541 --> 00:51:10,000
Where will it come from?
From the left or the right?

924
00:51:10,166 --> 00:51:11,500
Listen carefully, Mohile.

925
00:51:11,916 --> 00:51:14,125
Tsunami won't come for me alone.

926
00:51:14,291 --> 00:51:17,500
It will come for you, Durva, that old
man and his granddaughter everyone!

927
00:51:17,916 --> 00:51:19,250
Tsunami.

928
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:21,750
You're accusing me
like I raped someone.

929
00:51:24,291 --> 00:51:25,875
He's spoiled my mood.

930
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:28,375
I am leaving the car and money behind.

931
00:51:28,791 --> 00:51:30,000
I'll take it tomorrow.

932
00:51:30,791 --> 00:51:33,125
And in case you need any money,
then you can take it from the bag.

933
00:51:39,166 --> 00:51:40,000
Father.

934
00:51:41,041 --> 00:51:43,250
Father, tomorrow is
the last date for admission.

935
00:51:43,541 --> 00:51:46,875
If I don't pay the fee in full,
they will cancel my admission.

936
00:51:48,875 --> 00:51:49,625
How much is it?

937
00:51:50,541 --> 00:51:52,458
We've only paid 25,000 till now.

938
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:54,000
We'll need 125,000 more.

939
00:51:57,666 --> 00:51:59,000
I don't have that kind of money, dear.

940
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:04,375
You know what, you should drop
out before they cancel your admission.

941
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:07,125
Great.

942
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:09,000
That's all one can expect from you.

943
00:52:09,291 --> 00:52:12,750
Have you seen the other
Police officers in your own area?

944
00:52:13,291 --> 00:52:16,125
Look at their lifestyle, their status.

945
00:52:16,666 --> 00:52:18,250
Shinde, yourjunior.

946
00:52:18,666 --> 00:52:20,750
His sister just finished
her computer studies.

947
00:52:21,041 --> 00:52:25,833
And sub-inspector Rajesh bought
two pieces of land in Sawantwadi.

948
00:52:26,291 --> 00:52:27,500
And look at you.

949
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,583
No good to yourself, or your family.

950
00:52:30,875 --> 00:52:31,458
Come on.

951
00:52:31,791 --> 00:52:35,583
I'll call your uncle,
he'll arrange the money.

952
00:52:35,791 --> 00:52:36,250
Come on.

953
00:52:45,416 --> 00:52:46,083
What?

954
00:52:46,875 --> 00:52:48,458
I came to pick you up.

955
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:52,875
And, also to say sorry.

956
00:52:54,875 --> 00:52:56,250
I went a little overboard last night.

957
00:52:58,625 --> 00:53:00,125
But your wife's absolutely right.

958
00:53:00,541 --> 00:53:02,125
Don't mind.
but you can still change your mind.

959
00:53:02,291 --> 00:53:04,166
- If you need money...
- Stay out of my family...

960
00:53:04,166 --> 00:53:07,125
Cool, cool, Mohile.

961
00:53:07,875 --> 00:53:08,750
What?

962
00:53:10,666 --> 00:53:12,125
Salute me, today.

963
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:14,625
Come on, make it a nice, crisp one.

964
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,500
Come on, just one.

965
00:53:16,791 --> 00:53:18,750
And no excuses that
your hand's paining and all.

966
00:53:18,916 --> 00:53:21,958
Sir, the salute is not for the man,
but the uniform he dons.

967
00:53:22,416 --> 00:53:24,250
- Meaning.
- You won't understand, sir.

968
00:53:24,875 --> 00:53:25,583
Let's go.

969
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:30,208
Everyone wants to
be Singham these days.

970
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:34,125
Happy Birthday!

971
00:53:35,666 --> 00:53:37,458
Simmba, there you are.

972
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:41,500
Why are you so shy?

973
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:45,583
It's Shagun's birthday,
so why are you so dressed up.

974
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:47,000
What's the matter.

975
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:49,000
Let it be, aunty.

976
00:53:49,666 --> 00:53:52,375
Stop it. Stop troubling him.

977
00:53:54,166 --> 00:53:56,250
- Happy birthday, Shagun.
- Thank you.

978
00:53:56,416 --> 00:53:57,791
- Isn't It nice?
- Yes.

979
00:53:57,791 --> 00:53:59,750
It's straight from the graveyard.

980
00:53:59,916 --> 00:54:00,750
What?

981
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:02,916
Joke. They are absolutely fresh.

982
00:54:02,916 --> 00:54:03,625
Excuse me.

983
00:54:04,416 --> 00:54:05,375
Shagun, come with me for a minute.

984
00:54:05,541 --> 00:54:06,375
See you.

985
00:54:07,041 --> 00:54:08,666
Hello, I am Suchitra.

986
00:54:08,666 --> 00:54:10,916
- Yes. Mrs. Mobile.
- Yes.

987
00:54:10,916 --> 00:54:12,250
And daughter Nandini.

988
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:13,625
I know.

989
00:54:13,791 --> 00:54:16,250
I saw your mother giving
an earful to that grump...

990
00:54:19,416 --> 00:54:20,125
Shagun.

991
00:54:20,125 --> 00:54:21,000
Yes, coming.

992
00:54:23,041 --> 00:54:25,500
The party's really
truly mind-blowing, Shagun.

993
00:54:25,666 --> 00:54:28,625
The cake, gift, balloons.
Everything's fantastic.

994
00:54:28,791 --> 00:54:29,583
Isn't it?

995
00:54:30,291 --> 00:54:31,833
You know,
as long as my father was alive

996
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:34,750
my birthday parties
used to be much grander.

997
00:54:35,041 --> 00:54:37,750
But, after he passed away,
these guys took over.

998
00:54:39,166 --> 00:54:40,458
Now they are my family.

999
00:54:41,666 --> 00:54:43,250
You miss your father, don't you.

1000
00:54:45,291 --> 00:54:47,500
Although we were father and daughter,

1001
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:51,083
But he was my best friend.

1002
00:54:51,541 --> 00:54:53,583
I was only four-years-old
when mom passed away.

1003
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:59,583
But, even after she was gone, papa took
care of me, Good Food, and everything else.

1004
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:03,000
Other parents sing
a lullaby to their kids.

1005
00:55:03,541 --> 00:55:06,125
But my father used to tell
me about his encounters and shootouts.

1006
00:55:06,416 --> 00:55:07,125
Wow...

1007
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:09,791
He must have told me
over 50 encounter tales.

1008
00:55:09,791 --> 00:55:11,000
Oh, God.

1009
00:55:12,916 --> 00:55:13,750
By the way, Bhalerao.

1010
00:55:15,041 --> 00:55:18,500
If you ever want to execute an
encounter, you can take tips from me.

1011
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,000
You're dangerous.

1012
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:29,875
By the way,
even my father died in a shootout.

1013
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:34,208
But, even today this Police
Station is famous because of him.

1014
00:55:37,291 --> 00:55:39,000
I am so proud of my papa.

1015
00:55:40,791 --> 00:55:42,500
- Hi, Shagun.
- Dhiraj.

1016
00:55:42,875 --> 00:55:45,125
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

1017
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:47,375
Come on. Come inside.

1018
00:55:48,166 --> 00:55:49,541
Simmba, how are you?

1019
00:55:49,541 --> 00:55:51,458
Tip-top. First class.

1020
00:55:51,916 --> 00:55:52,916
By the way, the cake has been cut,

1021
00:55:52,916 --> 00:55:54,000
so go help yourself

1022
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:55,250
You already cut the cake.

1023
00:55:55,416 --> 00:55:56,750
Yes... now go on.

1024
00:55:56,750 --> 00:55:57,375
Did you have a piece
of the cake, Simmba?

1025
00:55:57,541 --> 00:55:58,750
I did, you worry about yourself.

1026
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:00,250
I'll go get a piece too.

1027
00:56:06,291 --> 00:56:07,458
- What is your problem?
- What?

1028
00:56:08,666 --> 00:56:12,125
I've noticed that you
don't like Dhiraj particularly.

1029
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:13,333
Isn't it?

1030
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:15,375
It's not what you think.

1031
00:56:15,541 --> 00:56:17,500
He's a good boy but
has some bad habits.

1032
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:19,375
He gets a little touchy,
gets too close for comfort.

1033
00:56:19,541 --> 00:56:20,458
But the rest is fine.

1034
00:56:21,416 --> 00:56:26,208
Simmba, Dhiraj is my friend,
and there's nothing between us.

1035
00:56:27,375 --> 00:56:28,000
Really?

1036
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:30,125
Very good.

1037
00:56:31,541 --> 00:56:33,875
By the way, what kind of a guy
are you looking for to get married?

1038
00:56:34,041 --> 00:56:35,291
Just a general question.

1039
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:36,125
Me?

1040
00:56:37,291 --> 00:56:41,875
- I want someone smart and dashing.
- Yes.

1041
00:56:42,166 --> 00:56:48,125
And he should be at least...this tall.

1042
00:56:48,291 --> 00:56:49,125
Like me.

1043
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:52,875
And he should have...a
long Maratha mustache.

1044
00:56:53,041 --> 00:56:54,416
Like me.

1045
00:56:54,416 --> 00:56:57,625
And if he's a Police officer, then
that would be a icing on the cake.

1046
00:56:57,916 --> 00:56:58,833
Like me.

1047
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:06,500
Simmba...do you have any friend
who is a cop and looks like that?

1048
00:57:07,791 --> 00:57:10,583
No, I don't have any friend,
who looks like that.

1049
00:57:11,041 --> 00:57:14,000
But let's find one. Me and...Tawde!

1050
00:57:14,666 --> 00:57:15,458
Come on.

1051
00:57:17,291 --> 00:57:21,125
You can say all sorts of crap,
but not the one thing that matters.

1052
00:57:22,291 --> 00:57:22,875
Huh!

1053
00:57:23,166 --> 00:57:28,375
Instead of twisting your words,
if you had just said: "I Love You“...

1054
00:57:29,166 --> 00:57:30,750
...then we wouldn't
have wasted so much time.

1055
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:31,875
Right?

1056
00:57:32,791 --> 00:57:36,458
- Meaning?
- Meaning, Bhalerao...

1057
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:39,750
that you and me...

1058
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:42,750
Mind-blowing couple!

1059
00:57:45,166 --> 00:57:46,208
Shagun...

1060
00:57:48,916 --> 00:57:50,125
I feel shy.

1061
00:58:03,541 --> 00:58:05,375
"O sweetheart..."

1062
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:13,458
"...I can stay away
all night for you."

1063
00:58:14,541 --> 00:58:19,250
"My heart follows
you...wherever you go."

1064
00:58:20,041 --> 00:58:24,208
"Tell me what to do."

1065
00:58:25,041 --> 00:58:30,500
"If you ever get sad,
I'll be heartbroken."

1066
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:36,000
"My paths will be
easier with you in tow."

1067
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:38,875
"I'm going to be always with you..."

1068
00:58:39,041 --> 00:58:41,791
"All my heart says..."

1069
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:46,750
"...never go away from my sights."

1070
00:58:47,041 --> 00:58:47,875
"Without you..."

1071
00:58:50,041 --> 00:58:50,625
"Without you..."

1072
00:58:52,666 --> 00:58:57,625
"Without you...I've no reason to live,
sweetheart."

1073
00:58:58,375 --> 00:59:02,250
"Without you...I've no reason to live,
sweetheart."

1074
00:59:03,625 --> 00:59:08,500
"Don't leave me ever, sweetheart."

1075
00:59:09,375 --> 00:59:13,250
"Without you...I've no reason to live,
sweetheart."

1076
00:59:15,166 --> 00:59:18,875
"I've no reason...

1077
00:59:20,666 --> 00:59:23,750
"I've no reason...

1078
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:42,375
"When you're around,
I feel overwhelmed."

1079
00:59:42,666 --> 00:59:46,875
"Make my dreams yours too."

1080
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:53,125
"When you're not with me,
I can't take another step."

1081
00:59:53,666 --> 00:59:57,625
"I'll make my paths merge with yours."

1082
00:59:59,875 --> 01:00:05,125
"Even if the world forgets me,
but you don't."

1083
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:09,791
"You're my life,
and you're my salvation."

1084
01:00:09,791 --> 01:00:15,250
"True love is invaluable."

1085
01:00:15,416 --> 01:00:17,208
"Without you..."

1086
01:00:18,125 --> 01:00:19,458
"Without you..."

1087
01:00:20,875 --> 01:00:26,000
"Without you...I've no reason to live,
sweetheart."

1088
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:30,208
"Without you...I've no reason to live,
sweetheart."

1089
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:36,625
"Don't leave me ever, sweetheart."

1090
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:42,083
"Without you...I've no reason to live,
sweetheart."

1091
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:45,333
"O, beloved..."

1092
01:00:45,916 --> 01:00:48,375
"O companion..."

1093
01:00:53,875 --> 01:00:59,125
"Without you...I've no reason to live,
sweetheart."

1094
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:03,708
"Without you...I've no reason to live,
sweetheart."

1095
01:01:04,916 --> 01:01:09,708
"Don't leave me ever, sweetheart."

1096
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:15,250
"Without you...I've no reason to live,
sweetheart."

1097
01:01:16,291 --> 01:01:19,583
"I've no reason...

1098
01:01:21,666 --> 01:01:25,208
"I've no reason...

1099
01:01:27,291 --> 01:01:30,875
"I've no reason...

1100
01:01:36,541 --> 01:01:37,750
- Hello.
- Where are you, sir?

1101
01:01:38,291 --> 01:01:40,291
I want to meet you right now.

1102
01:01:40,291 --> 01:01:41,583
Are you getting fits?

1103
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:43,458
I am coming.

1104
01:01:48,041 --> 01:01:52,250
Mohile, I am here.
Why were you screaming...

1105
01:01:55,041 --> 01:01:57,000
How dare you do such a thing?

1106
01:01:58,416 --> 01:02:01,000
Who gave you a right to
interfere in our family matter?

1107
01:02:01,166 --> 01:02:02,333
What have I done?

1108
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:05,708
You used your dirty money
to pay my daughter's fee.

1109
01:02:06,291 --> 01:02:07,375
What did you think?

1110
01:02:07,541 --> 01:02:10,625
- Why are you yelling.
- Don't interrupt.

1111
01:02:10,625 --> 01:02:11,708
I Will.

1112
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:14,125
- He is my son.
- Right.

1113
01:02:14,541 --> 01:02:16,250
- He's my brother.
- Exactly.

1114
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:19,208
You've turned my wife
and my daughter on your side.

1115
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:21,750
You two have lost your mind.

1116
01:02:22,166 --> 01:02:25,375
Nandini, you will cancel
your admission tomorrow.

1117
01:02:25,541 --> 01:02:27,000
- Otherwise...
- Hey...

1118
01:02:27,916 --> 01:02:31,250
Don't you dare scream
at my mother and my sister?

1119
01:02:31,416 --> 01:02:32,250
Understand.

1120
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:36,250
Come on, Mohile, cool down.

1121
01:02:38,791 --> 01:02:41,500
I paid Nandini's fee with my salary.

1122
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:42,916
I was saving it.

1123
01:02:42,916 --> 01:02:43,750
Understand.

1124
01:02:43,916 --> 01:02:44,625
Nonsense...

1125
01:02:45,416 --> 01:02:46,250
You two 90.

1126
01:02:46,250 --> 01:02:47,375
Don't listen to this old man.

1127
01:02:47,541 --> 01:02:49,208
Who listens to him anyway.

1128
01:02:50,541 --> 01:02:53,833
Listen...l am in a good mood today.

1129
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:55,250
Let's drink.

1130
01:02:55,875 --> 01:02:57,375
I have a bottle, in the car.

1131
01:02:57,375 --> 01:02:59,375
I don't eat to drink anything
bought with dirty money.

1132
01:03:00,375 --> 01:03:01,666
It's an imported brand.

1133
01:03:01,666 --> 01:03:03,625
- You still don't want to drink?
- I do...

1134
01:03:04,250 --> 01:03:06,000
But I'll pay for my drink.

1135
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:16,000
You know Mohile, scientists
have found water and ice on the moon.

1136
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:19,250
- So?
- So what? We just have to take liquor.

1137
01:03:26,666 --> 01:03:29,500
Mohile, can I share
something with you?

1138
01:03:30,916 --> 01:03:35,375
I...love Shagun.

1139
01:03:36,916 --> 01:03:40,000
But do you know what's even better?

1140
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:44,333
She loves me too.

1141
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:51,458
And when she confessed
this...i...l mean...

1142
01:03:52,791 --> 01:03:55,500
It touched me.

1143
01:03:55,791 --> 01:04:00,125
Its called...feelings, emotions.

1144
01:04:00,791 --> 01:04:03,458
And a man like you
can never understand that.

1145
01:04:04,916 --> 01:04:09,166
Why? Whenever I say something
nice to you, you always spoil my mood.

1146
01:04:09,166 --> 01:04:10,750
What is your problem with me, Mohile?

1147
01:04:13,791 --> 01:04:18,375
Sir, Shagun is like a daughter to me.

1148
01:04:18,916 --> 01:04:24,000
If you cheat on her,
then I will shoot you.

1149
01:04:24,375 --> 01:04:28,375
Sorry. But I won't
give you that happiness.

1150
01:04:29,375 --> 01:04:33,458
Because I really love Shagun.

1151
01:04:35,041 --> 01:04:36,250
True love.

1152
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:40,458
"Mohile. Mohile.

1153
01:04:41,291 --> 01:04:45,000
There's no way I
can drink without you."

1154
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:49,375
Come on, Mohile, salute me just once.

1155
01:04:50,041 --> 01:04:52,500
Sir, you're drunk and so am I?

1156
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:55,875
Sometimes you have a pain in your
hand, other times you want the uniform...

1157
01:04:56,041 --> 01:04:57,375
...and now we're drunk.

1158
01:04:57,541 --> 01:05:00,208
You know, the problem is not with me.

1159
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:02,000
The problem is with you.

1160
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:05,250
Come on. Come on.

1161
01:05:05,416 --> 01:05:06,625
Sir...

1162
01:05:08,041 --> 01:05:10,333
I won't let you drive today.

1163
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:13,708
You're drunk.

1164
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:19,083
This old man won't forget
his character even after he's drunk.

1165
01:05:19,666 --> 01:05:21,000
Stop.

1166
01:05:22,041 --> 01:05:23,750
Hey wise guy, where's your helmet.

1167
01:05:23,916 --> 01:05:25,125
You'll have to pay fine.

1168
01:05:25,125 --> 01:05:25,750
Come on, take me home.

1169
01:05:25,916 --> 01:05:26,708
I am a cop.
Come on.

1170
01:05:27,916 --> 01:05:31,625
Take me home. Take me home.

1171
01:05:31,791 --> 01:05:33,750
Bye, bro.

1172
01:05:40,375 --> 01:05:41,625
Look, Akriti.

1173
01:05:43,416 --> 01:05:45,458
Stop. Stop. I said stop.

1174
01:05:45,666 --> 01:05:49,500
Don't go anywhere.
I am a cop. Save fuel.

1175
01:05:50,416 --> 01:05:52,333
- Akriti.
- Sir.

1176
01:05:53,125 --> 01:05:56,500
Remember I told you that even I used
to study like this, in night school.

1177
01:05:56,916 --> 01:05:59,000
How long have you
been teaching these kids?

1178
01:05:59,916 --> 01:06:01,250
Its been two years now.

1179
01:06:01,541 --> 01:06:02,500
What sir?

1180
01:06:03,291 --> 01:06:06,125
I have a headache
hearing "Sir" all day.

1181
01:06:06,541 --> 01:06:08,125
You're my younger sister, aren't you?

1182
01:06:08,625 --> 01:06:10,208
And I am your brother.

1183
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:13,625
- So call me brother.
- Okay, brother.

1184
01:06:13,625 --> 01:06:15,000
See...

1185
01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:18,250
Brother, can I ask you a question?

1186
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:19,375
Are you drunk?

1187
01:06:19,541 --> 01:06:23,458
See...already you have
a long list of complaints.

1188
01:06:23,625 --> 01:06:25,375
Are all sisters like this?

1189
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:28,708
If the brother makes a mistake,
then the sister has got to interfere.

1190
01:06:28,875 --> 01:06:32,125
Yes, sister has to say.

1191
01:06:33,416 --> 01:06:35,375
Okay, go. Go and tutor the kids.

1192
01:06:35,541 --> 01:06:36,583
I am going.

1193
01:06:37,041 --> 01:06:40,125
And remember what I said.

1194
01:06:40,416 --> 01:06:45,333
If you ever have a problem in life,
think of your brother.

1195
01:06:46,875 --> 01:06:47,875
See you.

1196
01:06:50,625 --> 01:06:53,458
Kids, study properly.

1197
01:06:54,166 --> 01:06:55,625
Don't trouble the teacher.

1198
01:06:56,166 --> 01:06:59,500
And whoever does, I will lock him up.
- I am the ice-cream man.

1199
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,750
- Policeman.
- I am a Policeman.

1200
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:03,166
You know everything, don't you?

1201
01:07:03,166 --> 01:07:03,875
Let's go.

1202
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:06,125
Bye, kids.
Bye, Akriti.

1203
01:07:08,666 --> 01:07:10,125
<i>Chem, where were you?</i>

1204
01:07:11,791 --> 01:07:12,875
What happened?

1205
01:07:14,166 --> 01:07:15,291
Deepak and Nitin?

1206
01:07:15,291 --> 01:07:16,125
What about them?

1207
01:07:17,666 --> 01:07:18,875
Drugs?

1208
01:07:19,166 --> 01:07:19,875
In the bag.

1209
01:07:20,125 --> 01:07:20,750
Did you see them somewhere?

1210
01:07:20,916 --> 01:07:21,625
Where?

1211
01:07:22,041 --> 01:07:22,875
In the pub?

1212
01:07:23,916 --> 01:07:25,250
Come on, let's go.

1213
01:08:51,666 --> 01:08:53,833
Hey, ...how did you get in here?

1214
01:08:56,416 --> 01:08:57,125
Who are you?

1215
01:08:57,416 --> 01:08:59,083
Come on. Come on.

1216
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:01,958
Sada sir.

1217
01:09:05,041 --> 01:09:06,250
I don't know how these two got in.

1218
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:16,875
What is this girl doing here?

1219
01:09:17,041 --> 01:09:18,583
She's the <i>same</i> girl
who tutors those kids.

1220
01:09:18,791 --> 01:09:20,625
And filed a complaint
against us to Bhalerao.

1221
01:09:22,416 --> 01:09:23,000
Bloody...

1222
01:09:26,041 --> 01:09:27,083
What is your problem?

1223
01:09:27,375 --> 01:09:28,375
My problem.

1224
01:09:29,166 --> 01:09:30,750
You two should be ashamed.

1225
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,000
You sell drugs.

1226
01:09:32,416 --> 01:09:34,000
Toying with the lives of children.

1227
01:09:35,416 --> 01:09:37,250
I'll tell the Police everything.

1228
01:10:02,250 --> 01:10:03,875
Chotu, run.

1229
01:10:03,875 --> 01:10:06,500
Give the phone to Kavya.

1230
01:10:15,875 --> 01:10:17,708
Catch him!

1231
01:12:27,791 --> 01:12:29,625
You think you can do anything
because I gave you a free hand.

1232
01:12:29,916 --> 01:12:31,125
Did you lose your mind?

1233
01:12:32,166 --> 01:12:33,000
Any news about the kid.

1234
01:12:33,291 --> 01:12:34,666
Our boys are looking for him.

1235
01:12:34,666 --> 01:12:36,208
If you can't find the kid,
find that Kavya.

1236
01:12:36,375 --> 01:12:37,875
Her home, college, every detail.

1237
01:12:38,041 --> 01:12:38,750
Find out everything.

1238
01:12:38,916 --> 01:12:40,750
- And send our boys to her.
- Okay, Bhau.

1239
01:12:58,666 --> 01:13:01,875
- Hello, uncle.
- Kavya, is Akriti with you?

1240
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:03,583
No, why?

1241
01:13:03,791 --> 01:13:05,833
She didn't come home last night,

1242
01:13:06,041 --> 01:13:07,625
so I thought she might be with you.

1243
01:13:09,666 --> 01:13:11,375
Maybe she left for the
library before you got up.

1244
01:13:11,916 --> 01:13:13,958
Don't worry, uncle.

1245
01:13:14,166 --> 01:13:14,750
Okay, dear.

1246
01:13:17,041 --> 01:13:17,916
Chotu.

1247
01:13:17,916 --> 01:13:19,250
That's the same kid.

1248
01:13:20,916 --> 01:13:21,708
Akriti's phone.

1249
01:13:23,125 --> 01:13:24,000
Where is Akriti?

1250
01:13:24,416 --> 01:13:25,958
Come on, show me. Come.

1251
01:13:27,291 --> 01:13:30,375
Boss, that kid's taking
the girl somewhere.

1252
01:13:30,666 --> 01:13:31,458
Then follow them.

1253
01:13:31,916 --> 01:13:32,625
And run over them.

1254
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,750
And bring that phone to me,
understand.

1255
01:14:12,625 --> 01:14:15,458
Boss, that girl went
inside Miramar Police Station.

1256
01:14:16,125 --> 01:14:17,625
And Bhalerao is the in-charge.

1257
01:14:22,166 --> 01:14:25,625
Sir, some goons are following us.
- Umakant, take a look.

1258
01:14:25,875 --> 01:14:26,875
- Yes, sir.
- What happened?

1259
01:14:29,041 --> 01:14:31,125
Sir, my friend Akriti
is missing since last night.

1260
01:14:31,541 --> 01:14:33,500
We set out to look
for her and these goons...

1261
01:14:33,875 --> 01:14:36,250
- Akriti Dave?
- Yes.

1262
01:14:37,166 --> 01:14:38,333
We are college friends.

1263
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:42,375
Sir, Chotu gave me her
Phone, which is broken.

1264
01:14:43,916 --> 01:14:46,583
Sir, there is no one outside.

1265
01:14:48,541 --> 01:14:52,375
- Do you know where Akriti is?
- Sir, he cannot speak.

1266
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:54,750
Can you take me there?

1267
01:14:55,791 --> 01:14:57,500
Borkar, get the phone repaired.

1268
01:14:57,916 --> 01:14:59,250
Come, Gauri madam.

1269
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:07,250
Bhalerao, our fates are intertwined.

1270
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,583
The one I've been looking
for land in your station.

1271
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:14,833
That child and girl are with you,
aren't they?

1272
01:15:18,041 --> 01:15:20,625
Now do as I say,
take the phone from that child

1273
01:15:21,416 --> 01:15:23,000
and bring those two to me.

1274
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:25,500
I am waiting for you.

1275
01:15:26,125 --> 01:15:29,250
One more thing, don't let anyone
else get their hands on the phone.

1276
01:15:29,666 --> 01:15:30,625
It's very important.

1277
01:16:03,541 --> 01:16:05,250
Who was here? Akriti?

1278
01:16:39,375 --> 01:16:41,250
Something's fishy,
something is definitely wrong.

1279
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:44,250
Something definitely happened
between Akriti and Sada-Gin“.

1280
01:16:44,916 --> 01:16:47,000
Why don't you ask Dhurva yourself?

1281
01:16:48,375 --> 01:16:49,625
So you're going to do as you wish.

1282
01:16:50,666 --> 01:16:52,083
I told you to get the phone.

1283
01:16:53,416 --> 01:16:54,125
Why did you go to the pub?

1284
01:16:54,291 --> 01:16:56,375
One thing is pretty clear,
Bhau, you're hiding something from me.

1285
01:16:57,625 --> 01:17:00,041
That girl Akriti went
missing from your pub,

1286
01:17:00,041 --> 01:17:01,125
there's definitely a connection here.

1287
01:17:01,291 --> 01:17:03,791
And she came to me last week
with a complaint against your brother.

1288
01:17:03,791 --> 01:17:05,791
I know what goes on in the pub.

1289
01:17:05,791 --> 01:17:07,375
And yet I ignored it, just for you.

1290
01:17:07,791 --> 01:17:09,166
But you hid it from me.

1291
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:10,375
There's nothing to hide.

1292
01:17:11,250 --> 01:17:13,500
We got into this business because
my brothers saw some potential in it.

1293
01:17:13,916 --> 01:17:15,875
You're not the only one
who wants to move up in life.

1294
01:17:17,166 --> 01:17:19,500
And she made a video of our business,
What's her name...

1295
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:20,375
Akriti.

1296
01:17:21,416 --> 01:17:22,125
Where is she?

1297
01:17:22,125 --> 01:17:23,000
Maybe she got scared and ran away.

1298
01:17:23,166 --> 01:17:24,125
Do you see her here?

1299
01:17:24,291 --> 01:17:28,208
Let me make one thing clear if Sada
and Giri did anything wrong with her...

1300
01:17:29,541 --> 01:17:31,250
...then I will drag
those two out of here...

1301
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:33,250
Shut up!

1302
01:17:35,166 --> 01:17:36,625
Not a word against my brothers.

1303
01:17:37,666 --> 01:17:39,333
If you say another
word against my brothers,

1304
01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:42,125
means crossing Dhurva Ranade's path.

1305
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,250
I've three dogs,
I feed them Pedigree (dog food).

1306
01:17:46,416 --> 01:17:47,625
And you're the fourth one.

1307
01:17:47,916 --> 01:17:49,125
I feed you money.

1308
01:17:49,625 --> 01:17:52,208
If you shoot your mouth again,
I will bury you alive.

1309
01:18:01,041 --> 01:18:04,250
Look, Bhalerao. Who is that girl?

1310
01:18:04,875 --> 01:18:06,375
<i>Sada and Gm are your brothers.</i>

1311
01:18:07,541 --> 01:18:09,208
We need you right now.

1312
01:18:10,125 --> 01:18:11,500
I'll give you anything you want.

1313
01:18:11,666 --> 01:18:12,750
Just bring that phone for me.

1314
01:18:13,541 --> 01:18:15,500
And, I really don't
know where that girl is.

1315
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:16,750
Swear on you.

1316
01:18:17,041 --> 01:18:18,083
You think I will lie to you.

1317
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,708
Go get the phone.

1318
01:18:22,416 --> 01:18:23,083
Go on.

1319
01:18:31,291 --> 01:18:32,208
Where are you going, sir?

1320
01:18:32,666 --> 01:18:33,583
Akriti is missing, sir.

1321
01:18:34,416 --> 01:18:38,125
It's quite clear that Durva
is trying to protect Sada and Giri.

1322
01:18:38,416 --> 01:18:39,625
And you let him go.

1323
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,750
Come, sir. let's arrest these rascals.

1324
01:18:41,916 --> 01:18:43,000
Wait, let me think.

1325
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:44,750
Think? Think about what, sir.

1326
01:18:45,541 --> 01:18:47,625
- Your money.
- It's not about money.

1327
01:18:48,666 --> 01:18:49,875
I am like a brother to Durva.

1328
01:18:49,875 --> 01:18:50,833
He won't lie to me.

1329
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,625
Even Akriti considers
you as her brother.

1330
01:18:53,166 --> 01:18:55,708
But instead of looking for her,
you're worried about your money.

1331
01:18:56,416 --> 01:18:58,750
I've never seen such a sleazy...

1332
01:18:59,041 --> 01:19:00,291
Alerting all Units.

1333
01:19:00,291 --> 01:19:01,208
Alerting all Units.

1334
01:19:02,416 --> 01:19:04,458
A girl has been found
in Serious condition.

1335
01:19:06,166 --> 01:19:07,250
There's no identification.

1336
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,375
- Tawde.
- Sir, Akriti has been found.

1337
01:19:13,041 --> 01:19:13,833
She is in the hospital.

1338
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:14,791
She is very serious.

1339
01:19:14,791 --> 01:19:15,625
Please come quickly.

1340
01:19:43,291 --> 01:19:46,000
Sir, the victim was brutally
raped again and again.

1341
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:49,625
She's lost excessive blood.

1342
01:19:50,916 --> 01:19:52,833
And even her intestines are damaged.

1343
01:19:54,416 --> 01:19:59,250
And the damage is to such an extent that
even DNA reports cannot prove anything.

1344
01:20:03,166 --> 01:20:05,375
I am afraid she won't survive.

1345
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:29,375
Akriti.

1346
01:20:33,125 --> 01:20:34,333
Your brother's here.

1347
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:40,625
Child.

1348
01:20:49,791 --> 01:20:50,625
Akriti.

1349
01:20:55,666 --> 01:20:56,500
Child.

1350
01:21:02,041 --> 01:21:03,000
Brother.

1351
01:21:06,916 --> 01:21:08,083
Who did this?

1352
01:21:12,166 --> 01:21:13,125
Tell me.

1353
01:24:12,041 --> 01:24:14,000
What have they done with my child?

1354
01:24:21,125 --> 01:24:22,583
She wanted to be a doctor.

1355
01:24:24,791 --> 01:24:26,000
She always said...

1356
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,500
Once I become a doctor...

1357
01:24:32,041 --> 01:24:33,375
I will tutor orphan children,

1358
01:24:33,750 --> 01:24:35,250
and treat them for free.

1359
01:24:38,250 --> 01:24:39,875
Money was never her main agenda.

1360
01:24:40,166 --> 01:24:40,875
Never.

1361
01:24:42,541 --> 01:24:44,750
She always cared for others.

1362
01:24:47,291 --> 01:24:48,791
And they did such
a horrific thing to her.

1363
01:24:48,791 --> 01:24:49,625
So horrific.

1364
01:24:54,166 --> 01:24:55,750
They killed my daughter.

1365
01:24:59,250 --> 01:25:02,375
I want to kill those bas***

1366
01:25:03,291 --> 01:25:04,708
Find out who they are.

1367
01:25:05,166 --> 01:25:06,375
You're a cop, aren't you?

1368
01:25:06,750 --> 01:25:08,833
And even she called you brother.

1369
01:25:09,291 --> 01:25:13,375
Don't you want to kill those
bas*** who did this to your sister?

1370
01:25:14,750 --> 01:25:15,875
Why are you quiet?

1371
01:25:16,541 --> 01:25:18,166
Don't you want to punish them?

1372
01:25:18,166 --> 01:25:19,958
Don't you want to punish them?

1373
01:25:32,541 --> 01:25:35,625
They killed my daughter.
Killed her

1374
01:25:41,291 --> 01:25:45,000
Sir, I just received a
call from the Police Station.

1375
01:25:46,541 --> 01:25:48,208
Akriti's phone has been repaired.

1376
01:25:50,750 --> 01:25:52,583
She made the last call to you, sir.

1377
01:25:56,791 --> 01:26:01,208
Sir, Borkar was saying that there's
a video of Akriti on the phone.

1378
01:26:07,750 --> 01:26:10,500
Bhau. Bhalerao isn't
answering his phone.

1379
01:26:15,666 --> 01:26:20,125
Shiva, go to the Police Station
and get the phone from Bhalerao.

1380
01:26:46,416 --> 01:26:47,958
There's your proof, sir.

1381
01:26:48,791 --> 01:26:50,333
But you still won't arrest them,
will you?

1382
01:26:52,750 --> 01:26:53,375
Forget it!

1383
01:26:53,916 --> 01:26:55,708
I don't want to work with you!

1384
01:26:56,041 --> 01:26:57,958
I've had enough of this bootlicking.

1385
01:26:59,166 --> 01:27:00,958
Have some shame all of you!

1386
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:05,250
And Tawde sir,
don't you have a sister as well.

1387
01:27:06,125 --> 01:27:09,875
Would you have kept quiet if
she had gone through the same ordeal?

1388
01:27:11,916 --> 01:27:13,500
I can't vouch for others, sir.

1389
01:27:14,375 --> 01:27:18,000
But I will do whatever I can alone.

1390
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:24,458
I cannot stoop as
low as you for money.

1391
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:58,583
'I am not as old as your sister,

1392
01:27:58,916 --> 01:28:00,000
but I can be your younger sister.'

1393
01:28:05,416 --> 01:28:08,125
'If brother makes a mistake,
then sister's going to stop her.'

1394
01:28:13,291 --> 01:28:14,333
Isn't that the phone?

1395
01:29:26,250 --> 01:29:26,708
"Here comes..."

1396
01:29:26,875 --> 01:29:29,125
"Here comes Simmba!"

1397
01:29:31,541 --> 01:29:32,875
"Here comes Police."

1398
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,375
"Here comes Police."

1399
01:29:45,375 --> 01:29:46,041
"Here comes..."

1400
01:29:46,041 --> 01:29:48,250
"Here comes Simmba!"

1401
01:29:51,875 --> 01:29:52,250
"Here comes..."

1402
01:29:52,416 --> 01:29:54,625
"Here comes Simmba!"

1403
01:29:54,791 --> 01:29:57,833
"Here comes Simmba!"

1404
01:30:01,166 --> 01:30:02,583
"Take them down."

1405
01:30:04,291 --> 01:30:05,625
"Take them down."

1406
01:30:35,291 --> 01:30:36,125
"Police!"

1407
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:39,500
"Police!"

1408
01:30:41,750 --> 01:30:42,958
"Police!"

1409
01:30:44,916 --> 01:30:46,250
"Police!"

1410
01:30:51,291 --> 01:30:52,583
"Take them down."

1411
01:30:53,625 --> 01:30:54,250
"Police!"

1412
01:30:54,416 --> 01:30:55,500
"Take them down."

1413
01:30:56,875 --> 01:30:57,541
"Police!"

1414
01:30:57,541 --> 01:30:58,333
"Take them down."

1415
01:31:00,041 --> 01:31:00,708
"Police!"

1416
01:31:00,875 --> 01:31:01,625
"Here comes..."

1417
01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:03,875
"Here comes..."

1418
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:10,375
"Here comes Simmba!"

1419
01:31:14,041 --> 01:31:16,708
"Here comes Simmba!"

1420
01:32:32,875 --> 01:32:34,583
Inspector Bhalerao,

1421
01:32:35,541 --> 01:32:39,833
welcome to Miramar
Police Station, sir.

1422
01:32:57,041 --> 01:32:58,125
"Police!"

1423
01:32:59,250 --> 01:32:59,958
"Police!"

1424
01:33:01,541 --> 01:33:02,250
"Police!"

1425
01:33:03,750 --> 01:33:04,500
"Police!"

1426
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:06,625
"Police!"

1427
01:33:07,291 --> 01:33:10,000
Mohile, get the jeep and
let's go to Durva Ranade's home.

1428
01:33:10,625 --> 01:33:14,375
His brothers Sadashiv and Gaurav
Ranade raped and murdered Akriti Dave.

1429
01:33:14,375 --> 01:33:15,958
Police have evidence against them.

1430
01:33:17,291 --> 01:33:18,708
Now even I've lost it.

1431
01:33:33,416 --> 01:33:35,250
Search the entire premises.

1432
01:33:35,541 --> 01:33:37,666
Search every nook and
corner and find Sada and Giri.

1433
01:33:37,666 --> 01:33:38,833
Don't let them escape.

1434
01:33:39,041 --> 01:33:41,250
They must be hiding somewhere in here.

1435
01:33:41,625 --> 01:33:43,250
Find them.

1436
01:33:43,916 --> 01:33:47,375
- Have you lost your mind?
- Durva Yashwant Ranade.

1437
01:33:48,291 --> 01:33:51,458
If you dare lay a finger
on an on duty police officer

1438
01:33:51,916 --> 01:33:54,458
...then I will arrest
you before your brothers.

1439
01:33:54,875 --> 01:33:56,250
Stay in your limits, Simba.

1440
01:33:56,416 --> 01:33:59,500
Inspector Sangram Bhaleroa.

1441
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:03,041
I am a senior police
officer and not your butler.

1442
01:34:03,041 --> 01:34:04,333
Show some respect.

1443
01:34:06,666 --> 01:34:07,500
Brother!

1444
01:34:10,291 --> 01:34:13,666
You think you can get out of here alive
because you're wearing that uniform.

1445
01:34:13,666 --> 01:34:15,125
- Tawde.
- Yes, sir.

1446
01:34:15,125 --> 01:34:18,125
If anyone tries to interfere,
then shoot to kill.

1447
01:34:18,291 --> 01:34:19,250
Straight in the middle.

1448
01:34:19,416 --> 01:34:20,750
Those are my orders, understand.

1449
01:34:20,916 --> 01:34:21,708
Okay, sir.

1450
01:34:23,375 --> 01:34:25,500
Don't try an intimidate me,
with your goons.

1451
01:34:26,166 --> 01:34:29,000
When I was a kid,
I shook everyone by breaking a bottle.

1452
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,125
Remember anything.

1453
01:34:31,541 --> 01:34:33,583
Shivgadh. Sangam Talkies.

1454
01:34:34,375 --> 01:34:37,708
Yes...l am the same
kid who you told, that...

1455
01:34:38,041 --> 01:34:39,625
Someday he'll cause a big explosion.

1456
01:34:41,041 --> 01:34:43,000
I don't have a bottle today, but...

1457
01:34:46,416 --> 01:34:47,875
...i can cause a big explosion.

1458
01:34:48,291 --> 01:34:50,375
Back then I let you
go because you were a kid.

1459
01:34:50,375 --> 01:34:51,625
That was my mistake.

1460
01:34:52,666 --> 01:34:54,250
But, I won't repeat my mistake again.

1461
01:34:59,166 --> 01:35:00,458
Bhalerao.

1462
01:35:02,291 --> 01:35:04,500
Don't come between a mother and son.

1463
01:35:07,250 --> 01:35:10,375
Aunty, do you know
what Sada and Giri...

1464
01:35:14,041 --> 01:35:15,458
Just a minute, aunty.

1465
01:35:28,041 --> 01:35:31,833
When you became a mother, it
must have been a happy moment for you.

1466
01:35:32,041 --> 01:35:35,000
Three sons. You gave birth to men.

1467
01:35:36,291 --> 01:35:38,250
You must have also thought
thank God I didn't have any daughters.

1468
01:35:38,250 --> 01:35:39,000
What's the point in having daughters?

1469
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:39,583
Sons.

1470
01:35:40,416 --> 01:35:42,000
They will make you
proud when they grow up.

1471
01:35:43,916 --> 01:35:47,875
See, aunty.
your sons have unaligned you- name.

1472
01:35:53,291 --> 01:35:56,625
Aunty, they raped a girl.

1473
01:36:00,916 --> 01:36:02,833
And then they murdered her.

1474
01:36:07,250 --> 01:36:10,208
She was innocent, only 19 years old.

1475
01:36:12,166 --> 01:36:16,458
But don't worry,
I am like your son too.

1476
01:36:17,291 --> 01:36:19,000
I will make you proud.

1477
01:36:20,666 --> 01:36:26,875
I swear I will
bring them to justice.

1478
01:36:30,291 --> 01:36:31,125
<i>Jaws.</i>

1479
01:36:31,291 --> 01:36:32,416
- Put those two in the van.
- Sir.

1480
01:36:32,416 --> 01:36:33,375
Let's go.

1481
01:36:33,375 --> 01:36:37,000
You should be made to run all the way
to the Police Station, you bloody...

1482
01:36:37,166 --> 01:36:38,333
Take them away, Shinde.

1483
01:36:38,541 --> 01:36:39,875
Come on, quickly.

1484
01:36:49,291 --> 01:36:50,375
Let's go and take care of this.

1485
01:37:05,750 --> 01:37:10,375
Durva was Bhalerao telling the truth.

1486
01:37:10,541 --> 01:37:12,833
No, mother. He's just being greedy.

1487
01:37:13,625 --> 01:37:15,125
He's falsely accusing Sada and Giri.

1488
01:37:16,541 --> 01:37:17,750
You don't worry.

1489
01:37:19,541 --> 01:37:20,833
I am here.

1490
01:37:26,791 --> 01:37:27,625
Lock them up.

1491
01:37:27,625 --> 01:37:28,250
Wait, Simmba.

1492
01:37:28,416 --> 01:37:29,375
Just wait.

1493
01:37:30,041 --> 01:37:30,750
We need to talk.

1494
01:37:31,416 --> 01:37:32,208
Let go.

1495
01:37:39,041 --> 01:37:41,250
That girl was making
a video at our pub.

1496
01:37:42,791 --> 01:37:43,750
We caught her.

1497
01:37:44,291 --> 01:37:45,625
We had nothing to do with her.

1498
01:37:46,125 --> 01:37:47,875
But later she started
talking nonsense.

1499
01:37:48,791 --> 01:37:51,083
She slapped me and
smashed a bottle on him.

1500
01:37:52,541 --> 01:37:55,125
A petite girl like
her raised her hand on us.

1501
01:37:56,291 --> 01:37:57,375
She hurt our ego.

1502
01:37:57,541 --> 01:37:59,000
She hurt your ego.

1503
01:37:59,916 --> 01:38:03,125
So, you rape the girl and murder her.

1504
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:05,750
Ego!

1505
01:38:06,916 --> 01:38:08,250
I'll take care of your ego.

1506
01:38:17,875 --> 01:38:18,750
She was my sister.

1507
01:38:18,916 --> 01:38:19,750
She was my sister.

1508
01:38:19,916 --> 01:38:20,875
She was my sister.

1509
01:38:21,125 --> 01:38:22,166
She was my sister.

1510
01:38:22,166 --> 01:38:25,000
She was my sister.

1511
01:38:25,250 --> 01:38:27,125
She was my sister.

1512
01:38:27,416 --> 01:38:28,250
You...

1513
01:38:28,250 --> 01:38:29,291
Sir, sir, sir.

1514
01:38:29,291 --> 01:38:30,250
No, sir.

1515
01:38:31,166 --> 01:38:31,791
No, sir.

1516
01:38:31,791 --> 01:38:32,500
Sir...
No.

1517
01:38:32,666 --> 01:38:33,750
Leave me. Leave me.

1518
01:38:33,916 --> 01:38:35,458
Tawde, I said leave me.

1519
01:38:35,875 --> 01:38:36,500
Leave me.

1520
01:38:39,291 --> 01:38:41,375
If any girl raises a hand on you,
you got to rape her.

1521
01:38:43,166 --> 01:38:44,666
I'll take care of your ego.

1522
01:38:44,666 --> 01:38:47,125
Jaya1Varsha! Deepti! Gauri Madam.

1523
01:38:47,625 --> 01:38:49,208
Take care of their ego.

1524
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,500
If I don't get rid
of your ego for good,

1525
01:38:54,791 --> 01:38:56,333
then I am not a Police officer.

1526
01:39:02,791 --> 01:39:04,250
Shove your ego up your...

1527
01:39:04,416 --> 01:39:06,000
Show me. You want to prove
your masculinity, don't you?

1528
01:39:06,166 --> 01:39:06,750
Show me.

1529
01:39:08,541 --> 01:39:10,000
Let him have it. Yes...

1530
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,250
What happened to your manhood now?

1531
01:39:12,250 --> 01:39:13,583
Come on.

1532
01:39:21,875 --> 01:39:23,041
You're a man, aren't you?

1533
01:39:23,041 --> 01:39:24,500
Show me, come on.

1534
01:39:24,666 --> 01:39:25,250
Show me.

1535
01:39:48,166 --> 01:39:50,250
"Hey man..."

1536
01:39:50,250 --> 01:39:52,166
"Hey man..."

1537
01:39:52,166 --> 01:39:55,583
"Walk down the path, man."

1538
01:39:55,916 --> 01:40:02,375
"Wait, 0 traveler,
this night isn't too long."

1539
01:40:03,541 --> 01:40:10,250
"Try to understand,
only a few more hours to go."

1540
01:40:11,541 --> 01:40:18,500
"Have faith,
the clouds will clear away."

1541
01:40:19,375 --> 01:40:25,333
"Your eyes shall
glitter like the moon."

1542
01:40:42,541 --> 01:40:43,625
Hello.

1543
01:40:44,166 --> 01:40:47,000
- Hello.Waman Rao.

1544
01:40:48,166 --> 01:40:54,250
I've heard you have a plot in the calungute
area, and I am interested in buying.

1545
01:40:54,416 --> 01:40:55,916
So, can we meet?

1546
01:40:55,916 --> 01:40:57,250
There's no point.

1547
01:40:57,791 --> 01:40:59,875
Goons have taken possession over it.

1548
01:41:00,125 --> 01:41:01,250
What do you mean by taken possession?

1549
01:41:01,750 --> 01:41:02,625
Who did it?

1550
01:41:02,625 --> 01:41:04,125
Goons are not the point.

1551
01:41:05,375 --> 01:41:07,625
Hooliganism is their job.

1552
01:41:09,916 --> 01:41:16,125
What I really regret that
a ba*** Police officer helped them.

1553
01:41:20,750 --> 01:41:22,125
What did you feel, Mr. Waman Rao?

1554
01:41:22,291 --> 01:41:23,750
Didn't you feel angry?

1555
01:41:24,875 --> 01:41:27,250
Didn't you feel like doing
something to that Police officer?

1556
01:41:27,250 --> 01:41:29,833
I did... I really did.

1557
01:41:31,791 --> 01:41:34,583
I wanted to give him a tight slap.

1558
01:41:36,041 --> 01:41:37,500
But I was helpless.

1559
01:41:37,791 --> 01:41:39,875
I am old, there's nothing I could do.

1560
01:41:42,125 --> 01:41:47,000
If that Police officer's father had
set him straight when he was a kid...

1561
01:41:47,916 --> 01:41:50,708
...then, he would've
never stooped so low.

1562
01:41:50,916 --> 01:41:51,875
I am an orphan, sir.

1563
01:41:56,750 --> 01:41:58,125
I don't have a father.

1564
01:41:59,416 --> 01:42:01,083
I've been alone since childhood.

1565
01:42:02,750 --> 01:42:04,583
I didn't have a mother who fed me.

1566
01:42:04,750 --> 01:42:10,125
So...whenever I was hungry, I did what
I thought was right to douse my hunger.

1567
01:42:12,166 --> 01:42:16,125
Actually...l never knew
What was right or wrong.

1568
01:42:17,250 --> 01:42:20,250
I had no one to teach
me right or wrong.

1569
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,416
But that doesn't mean
what I did to you was right.

1570
01:42:24,416 --> 01:42:26,000
That was wrong. Completely wrong.

1571
01:42:26,291 --> 01:42:27,333
And I admit it.

1572
01:42:27,916 --> 01:42:30,250
You said that you wanted to hit me.

1573
01:42:32,125 --> 01:42:34,000
80 hit me. Hit me hard.

1574
01:42:34,166 --> 01:42:35,333
Vent out your anger.

1575
01:42:37,166 --> 01:42:40,250
You said that my father
would've set me straight.

1576
01:42:41,416 --> 01:42:43,083
I never had a father.

1577
01:42:44,375 --> 01:42:45,708
So you hit me.

1578
01:42:46,166 --> 01:42:47,375
And then you watch...

1579
01:42:49,541 --> 01:42:54,125
I will right all the wrongs.

1580
01:42:54,375 --> 01:42:58,708
"I know the journey is difficult,
0 traveler."

1581
01:42:58,916 --> 01:43:01,458
Honestly, I will change.

1582
01:43:01,791 --> 01:43:02,750
I never had a father.

1583
01:43:02,916 --> 01:43:04,708
So you hit me, I will change.

1584
01:43:05,125 --> 01:43:07,333
Hit me. Hit me.

1585
01:43:09,375 --> 01:43:16,500
"March ahead...make the skies bow."

1586
01:43:16,666 --> 01:43:20,541
"Have faith, and make a resolution..."

1587
01:43:20,541 --> 01:43:24,208
"...you have to change your fate."

1588
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:26,791
"Don't be scared, 0 man."

1589
01:43:26,791 --> 01:43:28,583
"Don't stop, 0 man."

1590
01:43:28,791 --> 01:43:31,750
"Walk down the path, man."

1591
01:43:53,916 --> 01:43:55,125
Sir, Chotu is nowhere to be found.

1592
01:43:56,875 --> 01:43:58,125
What do you mean not found?

1593
01:43:58,125 --> 01:43:59,375
I've been calling
his father since morning.

1594
01:43:59,541 --> 01:44:00,375
But his phone is switched off.

1595
01:44:00,875 --> 01:44:02,208
And there's no one at home either.

1596
01:44:03,416 --> 01:44:04,875
What do we do now?

1597
01:44:05,416 --> 01:44:06,125
Sawalkar.

1598
01:44:25,291 --> 01:44:28,250
- Joshi. how are you?
- Fine.

1599
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:30,291
You're on the front page these days.

1600
01:44:30,291 --> 01:44:31,875
It's just...

1601
01:44:32,125 --> 01:44:33,916
The prosecution has
submitted to the court...

1602
01:44:33,916 --> 01:44:37,208
...medical reports of the
victim Akriti Dave, now deceased.

1603
01:44:38,791 --> 01:44:41,958
And Aniket More, aka Chotu.

1604
01:44:42,166 --> 01:44:43,625
Age 11-years, as the witness.

1605
01:44:43,916 --> 01:44:44,625
Please call him.

1606
01:44:44,791 --> 01:44:47,250
Madam, he's been
missing since morning.

1607
01:44:47,791 --> 01:44:48,875
We're looking for him.

1608
01:44:49,041 --> 01:44:50,833
Looking? Meaning?

1609
01:44:51,166 --> 01:44:52,375
Has the witness turned hostile?

1610
01:44:55,291 --> 01:44:56,500
What is this, Bhalerao?

1611
01:44:56,500 --> 01:44:58,125
What are you guys doing?

1612
01:45:00,166 --> 01:45:02,333
The witness in the...

1613
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:04,875
Sneha, wake up.

1614
01:45:06,250 --> 01:45:13,166
The witness in the case Aniket More,
aka (Chotu), age 11-years, turned hostile...

1615
01:45:13,166 --> 01:45:14,875
...before the first
hearing of the case.

1616
01:45:15,791 --> 01:45:19,750
The Police report states that there's a
video recording of the assault on Akriti.

1617
01:45:20,166 --> 01:45:20,750
Show it.

1618
01:45:33,125 --> 01:45:34,416
This CD can't be trusted.

1619
01:45:34,416 --> 01:45:36,125
- Do you have a pen-drive?
- Yes, madam.

1620
01:45:36,291 --> 01:45:37,125
Play it.

1621
01:45:48,791 --> 01:45:49,875
Is this a joke?

1622
01:45:51,666 --> 01:45:53,500
Didn't you check the CD
and pen-drive before submitting?

1623
01:45:53,666 --> 01:45:55,166
There was data on it, madam.

1624
01:45:55,166 --> 01:45:56,125
What do you mean?

1625
01:45:57,041 --> 01:45:58,166
Did it get erased on its own?

1626
01:45:58,166 --> 01:46:00,041
Someone's tampered
with the evidence, madam.

1627
01:46:00,041 --> 01:46:01,125
I see...nice.

1628
01:46:02,041 --> 01:46:03,250
And who do you think will do it?

1629
01:46:03,500 --> 01:46:05,750
The evidence is kept
in the Police record room.

1630
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:07,375
So who is going to tamper with it?

1631
01:46:08,291 --> 01:46:11,875
Inspector Bhalerao, this is
a heinous crime of rape and murder.

1632
01:46:12,166 --> 01:46:14,500
Please be serious, yeah...

1633
01:46:15,625 --> 01:46:16,250
Joshi.

1634
01:46:17,166 --> 01:46:19,125
According to the post-mortem reports,

1635
01:46:19,291 --> 01:46:22,041
...the rape was committed
on the night of 22nd September.

1636
01:46:22,041 --> 01:46:27,000
But Sadashiv and Gaurav Ranade were
not in the pub on that night, madam.

1637
01:46:27,791 --> 01:46:32,583
Both the brother was with Corporator
David Cameron at their farmhouse.

1638
01:46:33,291 --> 01:46:37,750
As a witness, can I call
the Corporator to the witness box?

1639
01:46:38,541 --> 01:46:39,166
Thank you.

1640
01:46:39,166 --> 01:46:43,500
On the night of 22nd September, these
two were with me at my farmhouse.

1641
01:46:44,125 --> 01:46:45,375
We met after a long time.

1642
01:46:45,375 --> 01:46:47,833
We talked till wee hours in the night.

1643
01:46:48,166 --> 01:46:50,000
In fact, I dropped them home.

1644
01:46:50,166 --> 01:46:51,500
Thank you

1645
01:46:51,750 --> 01:46:52,875
That's a lie, madam.

1646
01:46:53,166 --> 01:46:56,625
On the night of 22nd,
they were in their club Divine...

1647
01:46:56,791 --> 01:46:58,625
...where they host rave parties.

1648
01:46:58,625 --> 01:47:01,625
And during the day they
indulge in drug smuggling...

1649
01:47:01,625 --> 01:47:03,375
...by stowing them away
in children's school bags.

1650
01:47:03,916 --> 01:47:07,583
That night, when Akriti arrived at the
club with Chotu, she saw everything.

1651
01:47:07,791 --> 01:47:12,125
And when they saw Akriti
recording everything on her phone...

1652
01:47:12,375 --> 01:47:14,375
...then they got into a quarrel.

1653
01:47:14,875 --> 01:47:19,000
When Akriti threatened them to go to
the Police, then these two lost their temper...

1654
01:47:19,166 --> 01:47:21,750
...and in a fit of rage,
they raped her.

1655
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:23,916
They raped her in
a fit of rage, madam.

1656
01:47:23,916 --> 01:47:26,375
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1657
01:47:26,541 --> 01:47:31,708
The Police found no traces of drugs...

1658
01:47:31,875 --> 01:47:33,583
...and there is no evidence
supporting the fact

1659
01:47:33,750 --> 01:47:35,708
that the rape was conducted
on Divine's premises.

1660
01:47:35,916 --> 01:47:37,000
Here's the Police Report.

1661
01:47:37,166 --> 01:47:39,208
On what grounds are
you arguing with me?

1662
01:47:39,541 --> 01:47:44,166
Madam, my client is being
falsely accused as an easy target.

1663
01:47:44,166 --> 01:47:45,166
That's all.

1664
01:47:45,166 --> 01:47:50,625
Madam, they admitted to
the Police of raping Akriti Dave.

1665
01:47:50,625 --> 01:47:52,625
Hello Inspector Sangram Bhalerao.

1666
01:47:53,166 --> 01:47:54,791
For your kind information.

1667
01:47:54,791 --> 01:47:59,125
Any statement given to the
Police is not admissible in the court.

1668
01:47:59,500 --> 01:48:02,500
Madam, I know he's not
too serious towards his job.

1669
01:48:02,500 --> 01:48:03,125
I know.

1670
01:48:03,291 --> 01:48:06,750
But you should at least know...

1671
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:08,750
...that the court needs evidence.

1672
01:48:09,291 --> 01:48:12,375
Madam, I would like to request
the court to give us another date.

1673
01:48:13,541 --> 01:48:14,916
We'll get new evidence, madam.

1674
01:48:14,916 --> 01:48:16,625
On what basis are you asking
for another hearing date?

1675
01:48:17,166 --> 01:48:20,958
You have no CCTV footage, nor witness.

1676
01:48:21,166 --> 01:48:22,250
Nor any proof.

1677
01:48:22,500 --> 01:48:25,375
Then on what basis is Sangram
Bhalerao accusing my client.

1678
01:48:25,791 --> 01:48:26,750
I will tell you why?

1679
01:48:27,291 --> 01:48:28,208
It's nothing.

1680
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:33,041
He's just venting his
personal frustration, madam.

1681
01:48:33,041 --> 01:48:34,000
Nothing more.

1682
01:48:34,166 --> 01:48:36,125
On the first day of his
duty in Miramar Police station...

1683
01:48:36,125 --> 01:48:40,166
...he went straight to Sadashiv
and Gaurav Ranade's pub.

1684
01:48:40,166 --> 01:48:43,125
Even though that pub isn't
under his jurisdiction, madam.

1685
01:48:43,291 --> 01:48:45,625
Extortion, madam. Extortion.

1686
01:48:45,916 --> 01:48:52,166
When Sadashiv and Gaurav Ranade refused
to pay protection money to Sangram Bhalerao...

1687
01:48:52,166 --> 01:48:55,000
...then this man here
couldn't digest it.

1688
01:48:56,041 --> 01:48:58,500
And when Akriti Dave was raped,

1689
01:48:58,791 --> 01:49:00,916
then Inspector Sangram Bhalerao...

1690
01:49:00,916 --> 01:49:06,500
...falsely accused my client
of rape and murder, madam.

1691
01:49:06,791 --> 01:49:09,375
Why? Just for revenge.

1692
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:15,375
Madam, I would request the
court to suspend such officers.

1693
01:49:16,041 --> 01:49:21,125
I wish, madam, that instead
of falsely accusing my clients...

1694
01:49:21,500 --> 01:49:24,583
...Sangram Bhalerao had used his
efforts in finding the real rapists...

1695
01:49:24,791 --> 01:49:28,166
...then he wouldn't be
wasting the court's time.

1696
01:49:28,166 --> 01:49:29,000
That's all.

1697
01:49:41,166 --> 01:49:42,000
Wait a minute, madam.

1698
01:49:43,166 --> 01:49:44,125
I have something to say.

1699
01:49:46,166 --> 01:49:49,000
I am sure you remember
Delhi's Nirbhaya case.

1700
01:49:49,166 --> 01:49:50,000
You all do.

1701
01:49:51,791 --> 01:49:54,583
That rape was committed
on 16th December 2012.

1702
01:49:57,541 --> 01:49:59,375
The entire country had united.

1703
01:49:59,541 --> 01:50:01,125
Everyone raised their
voice for justice.

1704
01:50:02,500 --> 01:50:03,750
But what happened after that?

1705
01:50:05,791 --> 01:50:08,208
The very next year, in 2013...

1706
01:50:09,291 --> 01:50:12,333
...there was 33,707
rapes in our country.

1707
01:50:12,791 --> 01:50:16,000
In 2014, 36,735 rapes.

1708
01:50:16,166 --> 01:50:19,000
In '15, 34,651 rapes.

1709
01:50:19,166 --> 01:50:22,125
In 2016, 38, 937 rapes.

1710
01:50:22,916 --> 01:50:25,875
And the records of
2017 and 2018 is yet to come.

1711
01:50:29,291 --> 01:50:36,625
More than 180,000 rapes in
our country in the last 5 years.

1712
01:50:37,416 --> 01:50:38,250
I am not making it up, madam.

1713
01:50:38,416 --> 01:50:39,833
National Crime Bureau.

1714
01:50:40,375 --> 01:50:41,750
The entire information is available,

1715
01:50:41,750 --> 01:50:42,625
you can all take a look.

1716
01:50:42,625 --> 01:50:43,625
You too, Mr. Joshi.

1717
01:50:45,791 --> 01:50:48,625
Madam, there are many other cases...

1718
01:50:48,916 --> 01:50:52,625
...which don't get registered
out of fear, or embarrassment.

1719
01:50:57,166 --> 01:51:01,250
Last year...an 8-month-old
child was raped.

1720
01:51:04,541 --> 01:51:05,750
8-month-old.

1721
01:51:09,375 --> 01:51:12,125
When Nirbhaya incident happened,
the country was awoken.

1722
01:51:12,291 --> 01:51:15,750
But these bloody rapists are monsters.

1723
01:51:15,916 --> 01:51:18,083
Their conscience will never awaken.

1724
01:51:18,375 --> 01:51:19,708
They have no fear, madam.

1725
01:51:20,291 --> 01:51:22,875
They think what's the
most that will happen.

1726
01:51:22,875 --> 01:51:23,875
We'll go to court

1727
01:51:24,041 --> 01:51:25,250
Then, from session
court to higher court.

1728
01:51:25,416 --> 01:51:26,750
From higher court to supreme court.

1729
01:51:26,750 --> 01:51:27,625
And, even if they get sentenced...

1730
01:51:27,791 --> 01:51:28,666
...they will be out on parole.

1731
01:51:28,666 --> 01:51:31,625
But every time they get free,
it will only encourage them further.

1732
01:51:32,791 --> 01:51:34,000
Then there's no saying...

1733
01:51:34,541 --> 01:51:38,000
...some 16-year-old girl studying in
National College can be raped too...

1734
01:51:38,625 --> 01:51:40,000
...whose name maybe Sandhya.

1735
01:51:42,666 --> 01:51:44,125
Isn't your daughter's name Sandhya?

1736
01:51:44,125 --> 01:51:46,833
Bhalerao! How dare you?

1737
01:51:47,791 --> 01:51:50,416
How dare you bring up my daughter?

1738
01:51:50,416 --> 01:51:52,750
I am sorry, madam. I am sorry.

1739
01:51:53,416 --> 01:51:54,583
That's not what I meant.

1740
01:51:56,791 --> 01:51:59,333
You're a judge, with power.

1741
01:52:00,875 --> 01:52:03,625
And yet you lost your temper
hearing your daughter's name.

1742
01:52:06,291 --> 01:52:08,000
Imagine that helpless father's plight.

1743
01:52:10,541 --> 01:52:11,708
How does he feel?

1744
01:52:14,291 --> 01:52:16,250
He's got the same
rage inside him, madam.

1745
01:52:17,041 --> 01:52:20,000
But unfortunately, he's not powerful.

1746
01:52:22,291 --> 01:52:27,958
But he believes that you
have the power to give him justice.

1747
01:52:30,791 --> 01:52:32,125
Just one more hearing, madam.

1748
01:52:37,416 --> 01:52:40,708
It's the least a daughter
of this country can do for another.

1749
01:52:51,750 --> 01:52:56,083
Madam. He's confusing
the court with his lectures.

1750
01:52:56,291 --> 01:52:59,125
His demand for an extension
is completely baseless.

1751
01:53:10,791 --> 01:53:13,125
Today is Friday when
the court opens on Monday...

1752
01:53:13,291 --> 01:53:14,625
Madam, you cannot...

1753
01:53:14,625 --> 01:53:20,125
Joshi. Please don't teach me my job.

1754
01:53:20,625 --> 01:53:21,375
Understand.

1755
01:53:22,791 --> 01:53:25,958
The court will announce
its judgment on Monday morning.

1756
01:53:27,791 --> 01:53:29,583
The Police has two days.

1757
01:53:30,375 --> 01:53:35,833
Until then Sadashiv Ranade and Gaurav
Ranade will stay in Police custody.

1758
01:53:56,291 --> 01:53:57,833
Who is the in-charge here?

1759
01:54:01,916 --> 01:54:03,458
Are you the in-charge here?

1760
01:54:04,291 --> 01:54:04,875
Yes, sir.

1761
01:54:04,875 --> 01:54:07,250
How did the evidence in
Akriti Dave case get erased?

1762
01:54:08,041 --> 01:54:09,000
I don't know, sir.

1763
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:10,625
- You're lying.
- Not at all.

1764
01:54:10,791 --> 01:54:13,750
- How much did Durva Ranade pay you?
- Not at all, sir.

1765
01:54:23,541 --> 01:54:25,625
Does he remind you of anyone, Mohile?

1766
01:54:26,666 --> 01:54:28,583
There was a time when I was like this.

1767
01:54:30,291 --> 01:54:34,083
Now I understand why
you were so angry with me?

1768
01:54:35,791 --> 01:54:36,750
What's the point in hitting him?

1769
01:54:36,750 --> 01:54:38,250
You should be hitting me instead.

1770
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,250
Afew men arrived in a car, sir.

1771
01:54:44,750 --> 01:54:46,625
They gave Chotu's father some money.

1772
01:54:46,916 --> 01:54:48,875
And he left in an hour.

1773
01:54:49,416 --> 01:54:50,958
He was a bloody drunkard.

1774
01:54:52,291 --> 01:54:54,500
No trace of the other children
who used to go to the club.

1775
01:54:54,666 --> 01:54:57,083
Sir. We checked at the pub.

1776
01:54:57,375 --> 01:54:58,958
There was no CCTV camera there.

1777
01:55:00,500 --> 01:55:01,250
I told you...

1778
01:55:01,916 --> 01:55:03,125
It's been three months.

1779
01:55:07,041 --> 01:55:08,083
Inspector, just a minute.

1780
01:55:09,291 --> 01:55:10,125
Take your shoes off first.

1781
01:55:11,291 --> 01:55:12,833
If the floor gets dirty,
my Wife will get angry.

1782
01:55:17,916 --> 01:55:21,791
You testified in the court
that Sadashiv and Gaurav Ranade

1783
01:55:21,791 --> 01:55:23,250
were at your farmhouse
on the night of 22nd September.

1784
01:55:23,416 --> 01:55:23,958
Yes.

1785
01:55:24,166 --> 01:55:26,166
We want to check the CCTV
footage of your farmhouse.

1786
01:55:26,166 --> 01:55:27,500
CCTV?

1787
01:55:28,166 --> 01:55:31,375
Inspector,
who installs CCTV in the farmhouse.

1788
01:55:31,541 --> 01:55:33,708
The farmhouse is to relax, you know.

1789
01:55:35,166 --> 01:55:39,750
But your servant said that just two days
ago you took down all the CCTV cameras.

1790
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:41,875
Don't listen to him.

1791
01:55:41,875 --> 01:55:42,916
He's stupid.

1792
01:55:42,916 --> 01:55:45,708
I am sure he doesn't even
know what CCTV stands for.

1793
01:55:45,916 --> 01:55:48,000
To be very honest with you,
I don't know either.

1794
01:55:50,041 --> 01:55:52,958
Is he stupid or are
you being extra-smart, sir?

1795
01:55:53,500 --> 01:55:55,916
Bhalerao,
I'll come straight to the point.

1796
01:55:55,916 --> 01:55:58,041
I've known them since their childhood.

1797
01:55:58,041 --> 01:55:59,375
They are not bad kids.

1798
01:55:59,750 --> 01:56:02,375
It's just their hormones.

1799
01:56:02,541 --> 01:56:03,583
It's very natural.

1800
01:56:05,416 --> 01:56:07,375
Dhurva is completely prepared.

1801
01:56:07,541 --> 01:56:10,458
You know. You work for him as well.

1802
01:56:10,791 --> 01:56:14,458
Durva is prepared to give 4-5
million rupees to the girl's father.

1803
01:56:14,666 --> 01:56:19,375
Even the girl couldn't have earned
that kind of money if she was alive.

1804
01:56:19,875 --> 01:56:21,125
It's a good thing for the father.

1805
01:56:32,666 --> 01:56:33,750
Stay...

1806
01:56:34,916 --> 01:56:35,500
Stay...

1807
01:56:35,666 --> 01:56:37,500
He's getting what he deserves.

1808
01:56:37,666 --> 01:56:38,750
Stay back.

1809
01:56:38,750 --> 01:56:40,500
Hit him.

1810
01:56:41,750 --> 01:56:43,625
Maria. Maria.

1811
01:56:43,791 --> 01:56:45,125
Coming, darling, coming.

1812
01:56:46,291 --> 01:56:47,375
Why are you hitting him?

1813
01:56:47,375 --> 01:56:48,625
Make a video. Make a video.

1814
01:56:49,291 --> 01:56:50,083
Okay, okay.

1815
01:56:50,500 --> 01:56:51,708
Make a video.

1816
01:56:52,125 --> 01:56:55,125
Shoot it. Shoot it.

1817
01:56:55,666 --> 01:56:57,625
Shoot it. Maria Shoot it.

1818
01:56:59,750 --> 01:57:00,833
In today's top 10 news.

1819
01:57:01,041 --> 01:57:05,625
Inspector Sangram Bhalerao forcefully
barged in Corporator David Cameron's house...

1820
01:57:05,625 --> 01:57:08,750
...who is the prime witness
in Akriti Dave Case, and thrashed him.

1821
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:09,958
The video's gone viral.

1822
01:57:10,625 --> 01:57:12,041
The Ministry has
expressed their anger...

1823
01:57:12,041 --> 01:57:14,500
...over the misconduct
by Inspector Sangram Bhalerao.

1824
01:57:14,750 --> 01:57:15,875
Only the time will tell...

1825
01:57:16,041 --> 01:57:18,583
...whether any action will
be taken against him or not.

1826
01:57:18,916 --> 01:57:22,500
The Police department has
no answers to our questions.

1827
01:57:22,791 --> 01:57:25,250
Can this is carelessness
on the Police's behalf.

1828
01:57:25,416 --> 01:57:26,500
Or their hooliganism?

1829
01:57:33,166 --> 01:57:34,583
You're suspending me, sir.

1830
01:57:35,791 --> 01:57:37,666
You know that Corporator is lying.

1831
01:57:37,666 --> 01:57:39,125
Is not about the truth or lies.

1832
01:57:39,500 --> 01:57:41,708
You clobbered him with a
shoe and sent him to the hospital.

1833
01:57:42,125 --> 01:57:44,000
He's an important part of our party.

1834
01:57:44,541 --> 01:57:45,750
The party's pressurizing me.

1835
01:57:46,416 --> 01:57:47,750
I will have to suspend you.

1836
01:57:48,791 --> 01:57:50,250
Even I have to answer to my superiors.

1837
01:57:53,791 --> 01:57:55,125
How much money did
Durva give you, sir?

1838
01:57:58,916 --> 01:57:59,583
Bhalerao.

1839
01:58:01,750 --> 01:58:02,333
Slow down.

1840
01:58:04,125 --> 01:58:05,833
You've already made many enemies.

1841
01:58:06,541 --> 01:58:07,833
You don't need one more.

1842
01:58:14,875 --> 01:58:17,250
Look. I understand...

1843
01:58:19,291 --> 01:58:20,125
You should too.

1844
01:58:21,541 --> 01:58:22,750
Things have really heated up.

1845
01:58:23,041 --> 01:58:24,458
As soon as everything cools down,

1846
01:58:25,166 --> 01:58:26,708
I will appoint you on a better post.

1847
01:58:27,041 --> 01:58:28,458
And Sadashiv and Gaurav.

1848
01:58:29,916 --> 01:58:31,125
They will be released tomorrow.

1849
01:58:33,291 --> 01:58:35,458
It's no longer about post or money.

1850
01:58:37,625 --> 01:58:38,625
It's about Akriti.

1851
01:58:47,250 --> 01:58:48,625
Suspend you.

1852
01:58:48,916 --> 01:58:50,500
How can they just suspend you?

1853
01:58:52,166 --> 01:58:56,125
Brother, you will leave tomorrow.

1854
01:58:58,375 --> 01:59:01,625
And even they will
be released tomorrow.

1855
01:59:06,875 --> 01:59:09,250
My father is the head-constable.

1856
01:59:10,500 --> 01:59:14,250
And my brother, Sangram Bhalerao,
is a three-star officer.

1857
01:59:17,250 --> 01:59:20,875
But...l am still scared.

1858
01:59:22,416 --> 01:59:24,250
Whenever I hear such things.

1859
01:59:27,041 --> 01:59:31,375
I am scared to go
anywhere alone at night.

1860
01:59:33,791 --> 01:59:36,500
Akruti was a topper of her class.

1861
01:59:37,791 --> 01:59:39,375
She wanted to be a doctor.

1862
01:59:41,666 --> 01:59:47,750
And these people shattered
her dreams in a single day.

1863
01:59:55,041 --> 01:59:58,500
Brother, the daughters of
this country are getting educated.

1864
01:59:59,916 --> 02:00:04,750
But who will save
them from these monsters?

1865
02:00:11,916 --> 02:00:12,750
Uncle.

1866
02:00:30,250 --> 02:00:31,625
Can I get a cup of tea, dear?

1867
02:00:32,666 --> 02:00:33,208
Yes.

1868
02:00:34,041 --> 02:00:34,750
Tea.

1869
02:00:37,416 --> 02:00:42,833
I just returned from Nasik,
after performing Akruti's final rites.

1870
02:00:46,666 --> 02:00:51,250
It's said that when you disperse
the ashes, the soul rests in peace.

1871
02:00:55,666 --> 02:00:56,625
I know...

1872
02:01:00,791 --> 02:01:01,708
...she is sad.

1873
02:01:05,250 --> 02:01:06,875
Her soul is not in peace.

1874
02:01:10,166 --> 02:01:14,125
And she won't rest in peace
until she doesn't get justice.

1875
02:01:21,250 --> 02:01:23,083
You couldn't do anything right.
Bhalerao.

1876
02:01:26,416 --> 02:01:28,583
They will be released tomorrow,
won't they?

1877
02:01:35,750 --> 02:01:36,833
Do one thing.

1878
02:01:37,666 --> 02:01:38,625
Give me this gun.

1879
02:01:38,625 --> 02:01:39,875
I will kill them.

1880
02:01:39,875 --> 02:01:40,916
What are you doing, uncle?

1881
02:01:40,916 --> 02:01:41,625
No, uncle.

1882
02:01:41,625 --> 02:01:43,916
Just say that the old man
went crazy mourning for his daughter.

1883
02:01:43,916 --> 02:01:44,666
Let go,

1884
02:01:44,666 --> 02:01:45,875
Please give it.

1885
02:01:45,875 --> 02:01:48,625
I beg you, please shoot me instead.

1886
02:01:48,791 --> 02:01:51,916
Take pity on me. Please.

1887
02:01:51,916 --> 02:01:54,000
Uncle. Uncle...

1888
02:01:54,250 --> 02:01:55,625
We understand your pain.

1889
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,750
But we cannot shoot
someone in a fit of rage.

1890
02:01:59,041 --> 02:02:00,000
We're still inquiring.

1891
02:02:00,416 --> 02:02:01,250
Come with me.

1892
02:02:01,875 --> 02:02:03,125
Dear, send the tea over.

1893
02:02:03,291 --> 02:02:04,000
Borkar.

1894
02:02:04,750 --> 02:02:05,625
Come with me.

1895
02:02:19,125 --> 02:02:20,750
What a day, isn't it?

1896
02:02:23,416 --> 02:02:25,875
I am sure he never harmed
a single soul in his life.

1897
02:02:27,666 --> 02:02:31,833
But he's willing to commit
murder for the sake of his daughter.

1898
02:02:34,625 --> 02:02:36,833
Sir, there must be many
other fathers in our country...

1899
02:02:38,291 --> 02:02:40,583
...who will only shed tears
for the rest of their lives.

1900
02:02:41,291 --> 02:02:43,208
Sometimes these things
really make me angry.

1901
02:02:45,291 --> 02:02:51,208
Honestly speaking, sir, until the cops
don't start eliminating these rapists...

1902
02:02:52,666 --> 02:02:54,000
...nothing around
here will change, sir.

1903
02:03:09,916 --> 02:03:11,375
I have a question, Shagun.

1904
02:03:12,250 --> 02:03:14,125
What would your father
have done in situation like this?

1905
02:03:14,291 --> 02:03:16,375
After what they did to Akruti...

1906
02:03:17,875 --> 02:03:19,958
...father would've shot them.

1907
02:03:22,875 --> 02:03:24,250
Direct encounter.

1908
02:03:24,541 --> 02:03:25,458
Direct!

1909
02:03:29,250 --> 02:03:30,750
And you ladies...

1910
02:03:30,750 --> 02:03:33,750
When you hear about rapes,
what comes to your mind?

1911
02:03:33,750 --> 02:03:37,500
- Pumima.
- That those rapists deserve to die.

1912
02:03:37,750 --> 02:03:39,875
You mean once and for all.

1913
02:03:46,291 --> 02:03:49,541
- What do you think, Supriya?
- They don't deserve to live.

1914
02:03:49,541 --> 02:03:50,500
Just kill them.

1915
02:03:53,666 --> 02:03:54,541
And you?

1916
02:03:54,541 --> 02:03:57,708
Hack them publicly.

1917
02:03:59,291 --> 02:04:01,083
What do you think, Nandini?

1918
02:04:03,250 --> 02:04:05,000
Don't be scared.

1919
02:04:06,041 --> 02:04:07,208
Your brother is right here.

1920
02:04:08,291 --> 02:04:10,250
Forget about the court
and Durva and everything else.

1921
02:04:10,416 --> 02:04:12,375
Just tell me what you think?

1922
02:04:15,875 --> 02:04:17,833
They should be killed, brother.

1923
02:04:31,166 --> 02:04:34,458
Bhalerao, what are you going to do?

1924
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:39,125
Your father made this Police Station
famous with more than 50 encounters.

1925
02:04:42,875 --> 02:04:47,833
Now before I leave, I'll
make this a historic Police Station.

1926
02:04:53,166 --> 02:04:55,500
You've heard many encounter stories,
haven't you?

1927
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:58,125
Now you get to see one.

1928
02:05:00,166 --> 02:05:04,833
Tawde, nothing will change until
we don't eliminate them, isn't it?

1929
02:05:06,666 --> 02:05:08,958
Come on, let's show them.

1930
02:05:13,791 --> 02:05:16,958
Come on, gang, prepare the tiff ins.

1931
02:05:18,166 --> 02:05:20,625
Its time for Sada
and Girt's last supper.

1932
02:05:21,541 --> 02:05:23,208
You're a policeman's daughter.

1933
02:05:24,250 --> 02:05:25,125
Don't be scared.

1934
02:05:26,416 --> 02:05:30,208
Protect the good,
and eliminate the bad.

1935
02:05:31,875 --> 02:05:36,833
Protect the good,
and eliminate the bad.

1936
02:05:40,541 --> 02:05:43,666
"Simmba..."

1937
02:05:43,666 --> 02:05:46,875
"Simmba..."

1938
02:05:46,875 --> 02:05:49,875
"Simmba..."

1939
02:05:50,041 --> 02:05:52,833
"Simmba..."

1940
02:06:41,791 --> 02:06:42,875
Sir...

1941
02:06:44,416 --> 02:06:45,375
CCTV.

1942
02:06:48,416 --> 02:06:53,125
Come on, then let's make
a superhit film on the CCTV.

1943
02:07:23,250 --> 02:07:24,958
Come, aunty. Come in, everyone.

1944
02:07:25,166 --> 02:07:26,083
Brought my dinner. Very good.

1945
02:07:51,791 --> 02:07:52,625
- Tawde.
- Yes, sir.

1946
02:07:52,791 --> 02:07:53,833
- Come, sit, let's eat.
- Yes, sir.

1947
02:08:01,875 --> 02:08:02,833
- Tawde,
- Yes, sir.

1948
02:08:03,916 --> 02:08:06,250
- I don't think they committed the rape.
- Why, sir?

1949
02:08:06,416 --> 02:08:08,875
Look at them.
They look like they are impotent.

1950
02:08:10,666 --> 02:08:11,625
<i>Look at Gm.</i>

1951
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:13,500
He's highly addicted to drugs.

1952
02:08:13,791 --> 02:08:15,000
Bloody junkie.

1953
02:08:15,291 --> 02:08:17,000
I don't think his thing works.

1954
02:08:22,125 --> 02:08:23,125
And that Sada.

1955
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:25,625
Arrested on murder charges.

1956
02:08:25,875 --> 02:08:27,750
Fresh out of the shell
and already in jail.

1957
02:08:27,916 --> 02:08:29,291
Sir, I've got some delicious
egg-curry, Do you want some?

1958
02:08:29,291 --> 02:08:31,500
Of course. Of course.

1959
02:08:33,250 --> 02:08:35,250
You need guts to kill someone.

1960
02:08:35,500 --> 02:08:39,291
These bloody leaches
are taking free credit.

1961
02:08:39,291 --> 02:08:42,375
- Bhalerao.
- Calm down.

1962
02:08:43,750 --> 02:08:45,250
- Gauri madam.
- Yes, sir.

1963
02:08:46,041 --> 02:08:49,625
- I think Durva's lawyer ls stupid.
- Why, sin?

1964
02:08:49,791 --> 02:08:51,958
If he had sent these boys for a test,

1965
02:08:52,166 --> 02:08:53,250
then we wouldn't
have gone to court.

1966
02:08:53,416 --> 02:08:56,375
They would've been let off
with a certificate of impotence.

1967
02:08:56,666 --> 02:08:58,250
You're absolutely right, sir.

1968
02:08:58,541 --> 02:09:00,000
They look like they are impotent.

1969
02:09:03,750 --> 02:09:04,750
Who are you calling impotent?

1970
02:09:06,625 --> 02:09:09,625
Bhalerao, do you want
to know how I raped that girl?

1971
02:09:09,875 --> 02:09:10,625
Huh...

1972
02:09:11,541 --> 02:09:13,500
First, we had our fun with her.

1973
02:09:15,666 --> 02:09:17,625
Then we made her suffer to death.

1974
02:09:23,666 --> 02:09:26,250
I don't know how she was still alive.

1975
02:09:28,875 --> 02:09:32,875
If you don't believe me, then we can
give you a demonstration on that girl.

1976
02:09:38,125 --> 02:09:40,375
She's like a sister to you, isn't she?

1977
02:09:41,166 --> 02:09:42,125
Send her inside.

1978
02:09:42,291 --> 02:09:43,875
And we'll show you
if we're men or not.

1979
02:09:44,250 --> 02:09:44,875
Send her in.

1980
02:09:56,750 --> 02:09:57,875
What kind of a father are you?

1981
02:09:58,416 --> 02:10:02,375
He's talking nonsense about
your daughter and how can you listen.

1982
02:10:03,416 --> 02:10:07,000
Anyone else in your place would've
gone straight inside the lockup.

1983
02:10:12,250 --> 02:10:13,375
Give me the keys, Borkar.

1984
02:10:17,750 --> 02:10:18,583
Give me the keys, Borkar.

1985
02:10:22,041 --> 02:10:23,083
Give me the keys, Borkar!

1986
02:10:25,750 --> 02:10:28,375
How dare you say such
things about my daughter?

1987
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,250
How dare you say such
things about my daughter?

1988
02:10:37,166 --> 02:10:38,125
Old man.

1989
02:10:39,666 --> 02:10:40,833
You want to fight with me.

1990
02:10:58,625 --> 02:11:00,500
How dare you say such
things about my daughter?

1991
02:11:06,916 --> 02:11:09,083
Umakant,
Tawde, listen to me carefully.

1992
02:11:09,500 --> 02:11:11,083
Unclip your holsters and move ahead.

1993
02:11:11,291 --> 02:11:13,500
Take your guns out
and give it in their hand.

1994
02:11:20,500 --> 02:11:22,125
Borkar, cover us.

1995
02:11:25,916 --> 02:11:27,000
Leave him.

1996
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:28,291
Leave him.

1997
02:11:28,291 --> 02:11:30,250
How dare he hit you, Mohile sir.

1998
02:11:30,250 --> 02:11:31,875
How dare you?

1999
02:11:58,291 --> 02:12:00,208
Sir!

2000
02:13:10,791 --> 02:13:11,875
There you go, uncle.

2001
02:13:13,500 --> 02:13:14,125
Justice has been served.

2002
02:13:25,416 --> 02:13:26,625
<i>Jaws.</i>

2003
02:13:27,041 --> 02:13:29,375
Get the CCTV footage and call IG sir.

2004
02:13:30,166 --> 02:13:33,500
Tell him Sadashiv and Gaurav
Ranade were killed in an encounter...

2005
02:13:34,041 --> 02:13:35,125
...at Miramar Police Station.

2006
02:13:52,041 --> 02:13:54,708
- So you had to kill them in self-defense.
- Yes, sir.

2007
02:13:55,041 --> 02:13:57,208
Sangram, I've been
in service for 30 years.

2008
02:13:57,750 --> 02:13:58,708
Do you take me for a fool?

2009
02:13:58,875 --> 02:13:59,833
We've proof, sir.

2010
02:14:00,166 --> 02:14:00,958
CCTV footage.

2011
02:14:02,916 --> 02:14:04,125
Increase security at the hospital.

2012
02:14:06,875 --> 02:14:08,208
Durva Ranade won't stay quiet.

2013
02:14:36,041 --> 02:14:36,625
<i>Banker.</i>

2014
02:14:39,541 --> 02:14:42,375
what...will we tell mother?

2015
02:14:47,750 --> 02:14:51,375
Durva, Inspector Bhalerao
had to shoot them in self-defense.

2016
02:14:52,166 --> 02:14:53,375
We've proof and witnesses.

2017
02:14:54,166 --> 02:14:56,083
Do you think I am crazy, IG?

2018
02:14:56,875 --> 02:14:58,083
He killed my brothers.

2019
02:14:58,666 --> 02:14:59,625
Murdered them.

2020
02:15:00,166 --> 02:15:01,750
Where is that Bhalerao?

2021
02:15:01,750 --> 02:15:02,208
Stop him.

2022
02:15:08,416 --> 02:15:09,625
Bhalerao!

2023
02:15:09,916 --> 02:15:10,916
Catch him.

2024
02:15:10,916 --> 02:15:12,833
You killed my brothers.

2025
02:15:13,041 --> 02:15:14,083
Simmba.

2026
02:15:35,041 --> 02:15:36,958
You're a dog.

2027
02:15:37,291 --> 02:15:38,083
You will die too.

2028
02:15:38,291 --> 02:15:39,458
I will kill you.

2029
02:15:39,750 --> 02:15:41,375
You're a dog.

2030
02:15:41,666 --> 02:15:43,166
You lived off our money.

2031
02:15:43,166 --> 02:15:44,958
And now you did this.

2032
02:15:45,541 --> 02:15:46,625
You're an orphan, aren't you?

2033
02:15:46,791 --> 02:15:48,458
You don't know what a family is.

2034
02:15:48,875 --> 02:15:50,458
You don't know what a father means.

2035
02:15:50,750 --> 02:15:52,458
You don't know what a mother means.

2036
02:15:52,875 --> 02:15:54,666
A brother or a sister.

2037
02:15:54,666 --> 02:15:56,250
You're a bloody insect.

2038
02:15:56,416 --> 02:15:57,250
Wrong!

2039
02:15:58,250 --> 02:16:00,375
Wrong again, Durva.

2040
02:16:00,625 --> 02:16:01,750
I have a family.

2041
02:16:01,916 --> 02:16:03,208
A complete family.

2042
02:16:04,666 --> 02:16:05,833
I have a father.

2043
02:16:09,541 --> 02:16:10,875
A mother.

2044
02:16:14,041 --> 02:16:15,833
I have a sister as well.

2045
02:16:18,666 --> 02:16:20,125
Yes! I don't have a brother.

2046
02:16:21,166 --> 02:16:22,708
But, now nor do you.

2047
02:16:22,875 --> 02:16:25,125
Bhalerao!

2048
02:16:25,291 --> 02:16:28,125
"Here comes Simmba."

2049
02:16:31,875 --> 02:16:34,750
"Here comes Simmba."

2050
02:16:37,916 --> 02:16:39,000
"Take him down."

2051
02:16:40,291 --> 02:16:40,958
"Police!"

2052
02:16:41,125 --> 02:16:42,750
"Take him down."

2053
02:16:43,541 --> 02:16:44,125
"Police!"

2054
02:16:45,541 --> 02:16:46,666
Sir. Sir...

2055
02:16:46,666 --> 02:16:47,291
Sir...

2056
02:16:47,291 --> 02:16:48,125
Just a minute.

2057
02:16:48,500 --> 02:16:49,500
What are you doing?

2058
02:16:49,666 --> 02:16:51,958
The Police,
public, and media are all out there.

2059
02:16:52,875 --> 02:16:54,583
- I'll see him it count...
- No.

2060
02:16:54,875 --> 02:16:56,291
No more courts.

2061
02:16:56,291 --> 02:16:57,500
No more case.

2062
02:16:57,500 --> 02:16:58,125
I want to kill that rascal...

2063
02:16:58,291 --> 02:16:59,500
Calm down.

2064
02:16:59,500 --> 02:17:00,291
Calm down, Bhau

2065
02:17:00,291 --> 02:17:00,916
Sit down.

2066
02:17:00,916 --> 02:17:02,833
Please calm down.

2067
02:17:04,666 --> 02:17:06,625
Right now just take
care of your mother.

2068
02:17:10,541 --> 02:17:11,208
Please.

2069
02:17:21,041 --> 02:17:21,875
Papa.

2070
02:17:22,875 --> 02:17:26,583
Even you know what brother
Simmba did was right.

2071
02:17:28,416 --> 02:17:30,125
But now you must do what I say.

2072
02:17:32,041 --> 02:17:34,375
Please stop brother
Simmba's suspension.

2073
02:17:39,916 --> 02:17:41,875
What if it was me instead of Akruti?

2074
02:17:51,125 --> 02:17:53,750
This CCTV footage is staged.

2075
02:17:54,125 --> 02:17:55,291
It's just drama.

2076
02:17:55,291 --> 02:18:00,666
I am completely sure that my clients
Sadashiv and Gaurav Ranade...

2077
02:18:00,666 --> 02:18:02,625
...weren't killed in self defense.

2078
02:18:04,041 --> 02:18:07,833
They were cunningly drawn
out of their cell and murdered.

2079
02:18:08,916 --> 02:18:13,500
For the further investigation of this
case, I would request the panel...

2080
02:18:14,791 --> 02:18:16,375
...for an SIT Committee.

2081
02:18:16,791 --> 02:18:19,625
These allegations are baseless, madam.
You saw it yourself...

2082
02:18:20,416 --> 02:18:22,458
There were nine
witnesses present there.

2083
02:18:22,666 --> 02:18:24,083
And they have given their statements.

2084
02:18:24,541 --> 02:18:25,750
So why this inquiry now?

2085
02:18:25,916 --> 02:18:30,458
Sadashiv and Gaurav Ranade were accused rapists,
Mr. Sawalkar, but not proven.

2086
02:18:32,250 --> 02:18:34,125
They were to be released
from jail the next day.

2087
02:18:35,750 --> 02:18:38,625
And ma'am,
while they were in Police demand...

2088
02:18:38,625 --> 02:18:41,000
...why would they
misbehave with any girl?

2089
02:18:41,541 --> 02:18:44,625
Why will they snatch the
guns from the Police officers...

2090
02:18:44,625 --> 02:18:47,375
...and attack Inspector
Sangram Bhalerao.

2091
02:18:47,875 --> 02:18:49,458
And most importantly...

2092
02:18:50,041 --> 02:18:53,750
The footage we saw, only had video...

2093
02:18:54,416 --> 02:18:55,500
...there was no audio.

2094
02:18:56,291 --> 02:18:57,208
Think about it.

2095
02:19:00,125 --> 02:19:01,541
- But.madam.

2096
02:19:01,541 --> 02:19:02,708
Sawalkar.

2097
02:19:03,500 --> 02:19:05,250
Your witnesses are telling
the truth correct?

2098
02:19:05,666 --> 02:19:07,500
- Yes, madam.
- Then what is the problem?

2099
02:19:09,791 --> 02:19:12,583
We'll appoint an SIT
Committee for further inquiry.

2100
02:19:13,666 --> 02:19:14,750
Ma'am.

2101
02:19:15,625 --> 02:19:18,625
This murder was committed inside
the Police Station very cunningly.

2102
02:19:21,541 --> 02:19:23,250
The inquiry can be doctored.

2103
02:19:25,541 --> 02:19:28,500
This inquiry has to
be fair and impartial.

2104
02:19:29,041 --> 02:19:32,000
Madam, I will solve Mr.
Joshi's problem.

2105
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:36,833
The state will appoint a neutral
officer for this special inquiry.

2106
02:19:37,750 --> 02:19:38,458
Okay.

2107
02:20:04,166 --> 02:20:09,458
Bhau, we still have a card left up our sleeve,
The SIT Committee. Don't stress

2108
02:20:09,916 --> 02:20:13,250
Once the SIT Committee
officer has done his investigation,

2109
02:20:13,416 --> 02:20:15,041
and Simmba loses his job...

2110
02:20:15,041 --> 02:20:16,458
...later you can...

2111
02:20:18,041 --> 02:20:20,000
I am done with the court and Law.

2112
02:20:20,416 --> 02:20:21,375
No more SIT.

2113
02:20:21,541 --> 02:20:23,750
He killed my brothers, Joshi.

2114
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:27,000
Now Durva Ranade will
do what needs to be done.

2115
02:21:21,166 --> 02:21:24,458
You must be wondering
what's happening to you.

2116
02:21:24,791 --> 02:21:26,000
You guys are the cops.

2117
02:21:26,541 --> 02:21:28,000
You make reports.

2118
02:21:29,416 --> 02:21:31,750
Tomorrow morning there
will be a report on you.

2119
02:21:32,125 --> 02:21:34,250
That will say that Bhalerao
was traveling in his car...

2120
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:36,875
...which was rammed
off the road by a truck.

2121
02:21:37,125 --> 02:21:38,458
The car plunged into the water.

2122
02:21:38,666 --> 02:21:39,875
And Bhalerao drowned to death.

2123
02:21:45,166 --> 02:21:47,000
You shot my brothers in an Encounter.

2124
02:21:47,541 --> 02:21:48,958
You killed them.

2125
02:21:49,166 --> 02:21:50,708
You killed them.

2126
02:21:57,541 --> 02:22:01,500
No! I didn't kill them.
I didn't kill them.

2127
02:22:05,041 --> 02:22:05,958
I exterminated them!

2128
02:22:06,541 --> 02:22:08,958
I exterminated your brothers!

2129
02:22:09,166 --> 02:22:10,208
Bhalerao!

2130
02:22:43,666 --> 02:22:44,625
"The heart trembles,

2131
02:22:44,791 --> 02:22:45,750
And the body quivers..."

2132
02:22:45,916 --> 02:22:49,750
"...when you know <i>he's</i> coming!

2133
02:22:50,041 --> 02:22:53,000
"Singham! Singham!“

2134
02:23:00,125 --> 02:23:01,250
"Take him down."

2135
02:23:05,416 --> 02:23:07,000
"Here comes Police."

2136
02:23:07,791 --> 02:23:09,250
"Police."

2137
02:23:14,166 --> 02:23:15,750
"Here comes Police."

2138
02:23:16,416 --> 02:23:18,000
"Police."

2139
02:23:27,125 --> 02:23:27,958
"Singham!"

2140
02:23:33,791 --> 02:23:35,458
"Here comes Police."

2141
02:23:37,916 --> 02:23:38,875
"Singham!"

2142
02:24:02,416 --> 02:24:06,750
"Here comes...Simmba!"

2143
02:24:07,666 --> 02:24:09,000
"Take him down."

2144
02:25:13,416 --> 02:25:16,125
"Here comes...Simmba!"

2145
02:25:19,875 --> 02:25:22,625
"Here comes...Simmba!"

2146
02:25:25,875 --> 02:25:26,875
"Singham!"

2147
02:25:29,041 --> 02:25:30,000
"Singham!"

2148
02:25:32,166 --> 02:25:33,333
"Police."

2149
02:25:35,500 --> 02:25:36,375
"Police."

2150
02:25:38,750 --> 02:25:39,625
"Police."

2151
02:25:41,916 --> 02:25:42,833
"Police."

2152
02:26:21,291 --> 02:26:22,333
"Police."

2153
02:26:24,625 --> 02:26:25,625
"Police."

2154
02:26:27,791 --> 02:26:28,750
"Police."

2155
02:26:56,541 --> 02:26:58,958
Bhalerao,
I'm here to investigate your case.

2156
02:26:59,666 --> 02:27:02,875
And I will soon find out the truth.

2157
02:27:05,166 --> 02:27:06,750
I know all about you.

2158
02:27:08,291 --> 02:27:09,375
You know what, sir.

2159
02:27:09,625 --> 02:27:13,750
Whenever anyone watches the news
or reads a story on rape

2160
02:27:13,916 --> 02:27:15,833
...whether young or old, male-female.

2161
02:27:18,250 --> 02:27:22,125
Every Indian has only one opinion.

2162
02:27:22,125 --> 02:27:25,625
These rapists should be shot dead.

2163
02:27:27,666 --> 02:27:29,875
It's such a horrific crime, sir.

2164
02:27:30,375 --> 02:27:31,958
Takes only a few minutes to commit.

2165
02:27:32,916 --> 02:27:36,208
But it takes a life time to get
justice against this crime.

2166
02:27:36,875 --> 02:27:39,625
Do you think that
your method was right?

2167
02:27:41,875 --> 02:27:43,375
That wasn't my method, sir.

2168
02:27:45,041 --> 02:27:46,750
It was Bajirao Singham's method.

2169
02:28:02,125 --> 02:28:04,250
This is my team's
complete and final report.

2170
02:28:04,750 --> 02:28:09,083
Office Sangram Bhalerao did not murder
Sadashiv Ranade and Gaurav Ranade.

2171
02:28:09,791 --> 02:28:11,375
He only shot them in self-defense.

2172
02:28:13,750 --> 02:28:14,708
And that's not all.

2173
02:28:14,916 --> 02:28:19,458
We can also prove that Sadashiv
and Gaurav Ranade raped Akriti Dave.

2174
02:28:20,416 --> 02:28:23,208
I want to call Durva
Ranade's wife and mother.

2175
02:28:25,666 --> 02:28:26,333
Please.

2176
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:56,250
That Akriti was raped by my husband's
brothers Sadashiv and Gaurav.

2177
02:28:57,375 --> 02:29:00,583
And yes, they also ran
a drug business in that club.

2178
02:29:00,791 --> 02:29:01,333
Varsha!

2179
02:29:04,750 --> 02:29:06,000
Do you know what you're saying!

2180
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:06,833
Enough!

2181
02:29:07,625 --> 02:29:10,375
What's wrong is wrong.

2182
02:29:10,875 --> 02:29:13,250
A girl's been raped, Durva.

2183
02:29:14,416 --> 02:29:18,083
Madam whether Bhalerao killed them
or was compelled to kill them...

2184
02:29:19,041 --> 02:29:20,208
...that's up to you to decide.

2185
02:29:20,750 --> 02:29:24,750
But my sons committed the rape.

2186
02:29:27,500 --> 02:29:29,625
Mr. Joshl,
would you like to question them?

2187
02:29:29,625 --> 02:29:30,250
Yes, madam.

2188
02:29:30,416 --> 02:29:30,875
No, Joshi.

2189
02:29:34,916 --> 02:29:36,083
You won't question mum!

2190
02:29:40,041 --> 02:29:41,500
Mum is telling the truth, madam.

2191
02:29:42,125 --> 02:29:42,750
Wow, Durva.

2192
02:29:44,541 --> 02:29:46,625
You really respect your mother a lot.

2193
02:29:48,416 --> 02:29:52,375
But you didn't teach your brothers
to respect other women.

2194
02:29:55,541 --> 02:29:59,250
Mrs. Bharti Ranade,
you deserve an applaud.

2195
02:29:59,875 --> 02:30:01,083
But I regret.

2196
02:30:01,541 --> 02:30:03,375
If only you had taken
this step earlier,

2197
02:30:03,375 --> 02:30:05,875
then a girl would've never
gone through such an ordeal.

2198
02:30:08,541 --> 02:30:09,625
I have a question, Mrs. Bharti.

2199
02:30:10,166 --> 02:30:13,500
What if you had three daughters,
instead of three sons?

2200
02:30:13,791 --> 02:30:17,625
Would you have still given them
the same liberty to do as they please?

2201
02:30:17,791 --> 02:30:22,375
Mrs. Bharti, you gave them the
liberty because they were your sons.

2202
02:30:24,541 --> 02:30:29,375
Pardon me,
you're as guilty as your sons are.

2203
02:30:30,625 --> 02:30:38,458
As well as all those parents who don't
teach their sons to respect women.

2204
02:30:40,666 --> 02:30:43,958
Mr. Joshi, you can appeal
in the higher court if you wish.

2205
02:30:44,541 --> 02:30:49,500
But this court is of the judgment that
Sadashiv Ranade and Gaurav Ranade...

2206
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:53,083
...raped and murdered Akriti Dave.

2207
02:30:59,375 --> 02:31:03,500
And Bajirao Singham's report
from the SIT Committed proves...

2208
02:31:03,791 --> 02:31:06,750
...the Sangram Bhalerao
fired in self-defense.

2209
02:31:12,250 --> 02:31:16,666
And under section 186 IPC,

2210
02:31:16,666 --> 02:31:20,750
assaulting an on-duty Police officer,
section 307 IPC,

2211
02:31:21,291 --> 02:31:22,375
...attempt of murder...

2212
02:31:22,625 --> 02:31:25,416
...section 22 of NDPS Act,

2213
02:31:25,416 --> 02:31:29,458
...the court sentences Durva Ranade
to 7 years of rigorous imprisonment.

2214
02:31:30,791 --> 02:31:33,125
And the written judgment
would be followed.

2215
02:31:51,041 --> 02:31:54,750
Bloody Bhalerao,
you are very talented.

2216
02:31:56,041 --> 02:31:59,375
You make any family your own.

2217
02:32:01,041 --> 02:32:06,125
You made my mother and
my wife, testify against me in court.

2218
02:32:07,250 --> 02:32:09,000
You really have an alt

2219
02:32:10,500 --> 02:32:11,458
What to do, Durva?

2220
02:32:12,750 --> 02:32:14,750
I was an orphan when
I was a kid.

2221
02:32:15,541 --> 02:32:18,000
And now he's showering
me with family.

2222
02:32:20,166 --> 02:32:23,000
I will be back... Soon!

2223
02:32:23,750 --> 02:32:25,333
You'll find me standing right here.

2224
02:32:27,041 --> 02:32:28,750
WhatsApp me when you get out.

2225
02:32:38,916 --> 02:32:41,625
Thank you,
sir, for handling everything

2226
02:32:44,041 --> 02:32:45,416
If it wasn't for you, then...

2227
02:32:45,416 --> 02:32:48,625
Mummiesneedbfeelmefear.

2228
02:32:49,916 --> 02:32:52,333
Right now this fear exists
only in the hearts of the parents

2229
02:32:52,666 --> 02:32:54,958
whose daughters come
home late at night.

2230
02:32:56,750 --> 02:32:59,125
Even if she's returning
from a party with her friends,

2231
02:32:59,541 --> 02:33:03,875
...or from her job, or moved
to a different city to make a career.

2232
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:09,750
I only helped you because
I wanted to instill this fear

2233
02:33:10,541 --> 02:33:12,458
in those monsters...

2234
02:33:13,041 --> 02:33:15,750
...who don't hesitate to
commit horrible crimes like rape.

2235
02:33:18,125 --> 02:33:21,500
Whenever they will have
ill-intentions for a woman...

2236
02:33:22,041 --> 02:33:25,375
...they must have this
fear in their mind.

2237
02:33:27,125 --> 02:33:31,750
That a few insane cops
will come and shoot them dead.

2238
02:33:33,500 --> 02:33:35,500
No arrest. No long court cases.

2239
02:33:36,291 --> 02:33:37,708
Justice on the Spot.

2240
02:33:37,875 --> 02:33:38,708
"Police."

2241
02:33:41,250 --> 02:33:42,625
"Police."

2242
02:33:43,541 --> 02:33:44,750
"Take them down."

2243
02:33:48,875 --> 02:33:50,083
"Here comes Police."

2244
02:33:50,291 --> 02:33:51,000
"Singham."

2245
02:33:51,166 --> 02:33:52,416
"Police."

2246
02:33:52,416 --> 02:33:53,333
"Singham."

2247
02:33:57,416 --> 02:33:58,375
"The heart trembles,

2248
02:33:58,541 --> 02:33:59,500
And the body quivers..."

2249
02:33:59,666 --> 02:34:03,500
"...when you know he's coming.!

2250
02:34:03,791 --> 02:34:04,625
"Singham!

2251
02:34:04,625 --> 02:34:05,125
"Here comes..."

2252
02:34:05,291 --> 02:34:08,625
"Here comes Simmba."

2253
02:34:21,750 --> 02:34:24,250
So you managed to save Bhalerao
after all, Bajirao.

2254
02:34:24,666 --> 02:34:26,708
He was leading a life of lies.

2255
02:34:27,500 --> 02:34:29,125
But truth finally caught up with him.

2256
02:34:30,666 --> 02:34:32,208
Truth is like the sun.

2257
02:34:33,125 --> 02:34:34,750
It might stay hidden for a while...

2258
02:34:34,916 --> 02:34:36,375
...but will come forth eventually.

2259
02:34:36,875 --> 02:34:38,958
Congrats on becoming
the new ATS chief.

2260
02:34:39,666 --> 02:34:40,458
See you soon.

2261
02:34:40,666 --> 02:34:41,458
Thank you.

2262
02:34:41,916 --> 02:34:43,333
See you soon.
