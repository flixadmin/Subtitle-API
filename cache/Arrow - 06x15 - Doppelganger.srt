1
00:00:00,159 --> 00:00:02,189
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:02,361 --> 00:00:04,514
After 5 years in Hell,
I returned home

3
00:00:04,515 --> 00:00:07,049
with only one goal--
to save my city.

4
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:09,817
Today, I fight that war
on two fronts.

5
00:00:09,819 --> 00:00:12,220
By day, I lead Star City
as its mayor,

6
00:00:12,222 --> 00:00:14,122
but by night, I am someone else.

7
00:00:14,124 --> 00:00:16,724
I am...Something else.

8
00:00:16,726 --> 00:00:19,160
I am the Green Arrow.

9
00:00:19,162 --> 00:00:20,762
Previously on "Arrow"...

10
00:00:20,764 --> 00:00:22,830
The new police captain--
she's on my payroll

11
00:00:22,832 --> 00:00:24,866
along with a few other
city officials.

12
00:00:24,868 --> 00:00:27,001
See, guys like you
never understand.

13
00:00:27,003 --> 00:00:29,971
Why destroy a city
when you can take it over?

14
00:00:32,008 --> 00:00:33,207
Mr. Ramirez suffered

15
00:00:33,209 --> 00:00:35,109
a traumatic
hemothorax.

16
00:00:35,111 --> 00:00:36,377
The injury caused his
lung to re-collapse.

17
00:00:36,379 --> 00:00:37,845
Oliver Queen,
you're under arrest.

18
00:00:37,847 --> 00:00:39,380
On what charges?

19
00:00:39,382 --> 00:00:41,382
Murder, assault,
burglary, and kidnapping,

20
00:00:41,384 --> 00:00:44,051
all stemming from your
activity as the Green Arrow.

21
00:00:44,053 --> 00:00:44,823
I think I just
found something.

22
00:00:44,824 --> 00:00:46,657
There's a record on how Watson
found out you were Wild Dog.

23
00:00:46,658 --> 00:00:48,057
There's
an audio recording.

24
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:49,959
The FBI's provided
definitive proof

25
00:00:49,961 --> 00:00:51,494
that Oliver Queen
is the Green Arrow.

26
00:00:51,496 --> 00:00:52,762
I'm gonna release
the defendant on bail.

27
00:00:54,939 --> 00:00:56,505
What's your name?

28
00:00:56,507 --> 00:00:58,307
Laurel Lance.

29
00:01:02,947 --> 00:01:05,114
- Ollie?
- Yeah.

30
00:01:05,116 --> 00:01:07,917
Jean here has
some good news for you.

31
00:01:07,919 --> 00:01:10,007
I'm only used to good news
if it's accompanied by bad news.

32
00:01:10,008 --> 00:01:11,841
Well, this news is unequivocal,
Oliver.

33
00:01:11,843 --> 00:01:14,744
I can get the case
against you dismissed.

34
00:01:16,096 --> 00:01:19,620
Uh, have--have a seat.
Tell me--tell me more.

35
00:01:19,622 --> 00:01:21,322
I pored over
the discovery documents

36
00:01:21,324 --> 00:01:23,490
produced
by the district attorney.

37
00:01:23,492 --> 00:01:26,460
Apparently, the FBI
leveraged Rene Ramirez

38
00:01:26,462 --> 00:01:29,396
to testify against you based
on surveillance that was leaked

39
00:01:29,398 --> 00:01:30,764
by a known criminal.

40
00:01:30,766 --> 00:01:33,467
- Cayden James.
- Fruit of the poisonous tree.

41
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:35,469
It's a legal metaphor
positing that

42
00:01:35,471 --> 00:01:37,304
if the source
of the evidence is tainted,

43
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:39,340
the evidence itself
is tainted.

44
00:01:39,342 --> 00:01:41,475
Mr. James' actions
were not only illegal,

45
00:01:41,477 --> 00:01:43,344
but his death makes it
impossible

46
00:01:43,346 --> 00:01:45,145
to corroborate the evidence
against Mr. Ramirez.

47
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:46,614
So if there's no
case against Rene,

48
00:01:46,616 --> 00:01:48,182
there's no
case against me?

49
00:01:48,184 --> 00:01:49,550
We're going before
Judge McGarvey

50
00:01:49,552 --> 00:01:51,185
on my motion
to dismiss this afternoon.

51
00:01:51,187 --> 00:01:52,686
Jean, are you sure?

52
00:01:52,688 --> 00:01:54,855
You--you can just
make this go away?

53
00:01:54,857 --> 00:01:56,790
Ollie, she's positive.

54
00:01:56,792 --> 00:01:58,892
Ok. I know you're not
used to getting good news,

55
00:01:58,894 --> 00:02:01,395
but this is
what it sounds like.

56
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,502
Mr. Mayor, we
got an emergency at SCPD.

57
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:10,571
Like I said, it was accompanied
by some bad news.

58
00:02:10,573 --> 00:02:12,640
Jean, this is
wonderful.

59
00:02:12,642 --> 00:02:14,108
I will see you
at the courthouse this afternoon.

60
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,409
Ok.

61
00:02:15,411 --> 00:02:17,811
What's up?

62
00:02:17,813 --> 00:02:19,146
Laurel just walked
into police headquarters.

63
00:02:19,148 --> 00:02:20,981
- What, to surrender?
- Not exactly.

64
00:02:20,983 --> 00:02:23,584
She told them
she's Laurel Lance,

65
00:02:23,586 --> 00:02:25,285
our Laurel Lance!

66
00:02:27,023 --> 00:02:29,590
Ok. Why is she claiming
to be Laurel Lance?

67
00:02:29,592 --> 00:02:31,325
Well, Dinah's out
for blood,

68
00:02:31,327 --> 00:02:33,160
and Laurel Lance,
public figure, is

69
00:02:33,162 --> 00:02:36,063
a much more difficult
target than...Black Siren.

70
00:02:36,065 --> 00:02:38,565
Except it's a lie.

71
00:02:38,567 --> 00:02:40,401
It's all
one big lie.

72
00:02:40,403 --> 00:02:43,070
Well, we need to get
to her before she gets to the press.

73
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:45,539
I woke up
in a cell...

74
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,975
And I managed
to break down the door,

75
00:02:47,977 --> 00:02:50,177
and I just--I ran.

76
00:02:50,179 --> 00:02:51,712
They held you
for two years?

77
00:02:51,714 --> 00:02:53,547
I don't remember.

78
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:55,315
They kept me drugged.

79
00:02:55,317 --> 00:02:56,784
The Black Canary
was reported dead,

80
00:02:56,786 --> 00:02:58,385
killed
in a prison riot.

81
00:02:58,387 --> 00:02:59,953
Damien Darhk--
he stabbed me,

82
00:02:59,955 --> 00:03:01,755
and the next thing I knew,
I was--

83
00:03:01,757 --> 00:03:04,058
I was in--
I was in that cell.

84
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,559
I don't know how,
but this is really, really bad.

85
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:07,461
Bad that we should
have seen this coming.

86
00:03:07,463 --> 00:03:08,696
Should have known
that she'd eventually try

87
00:03:08,698 --> 00:03:10,197
to pull something
like this.

88
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:11,665
Why would Damien Darhk
do this to you?

89
00:03:11,667 --> 00:03:13,634
Why would he fake
your death?

90
00:03:13,636 --> 00:03:16,103
I don't know why he would
want to fake my death.

91
00:03:16,105 --> 00:03:18,972
Maybe--maybe
to torture the Green Arrow.

92
00:03:18,974 --> 00:03:22,076
So you know who
the Green Arrow is?

93
00:03:22,078 --> 00:03:25,279
Ollie! Ollie! Ohh!

94
00:03:25,281 --> 00:03:28,115
I never thought I'd
see you again.

95
00:03:31,487 --> 00:03:33,587
Daddy.

96
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:35,422
Daddy! Oh, Dad.

97
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:37,658
Can you tell us any more information
on where you've been?

98
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,159
You notably
outed Ms. Lance

99
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:40,928
as the Black Canary
at her funeral.

100
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,496
That now seems
a little suspicious

101
00:03:42,498 --> 00:03:44,098
in light of the recent
allegations

102
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,499
that you are
the Green Arrow.

103
00:03:45,501 --> 00:03:47,434
It doesn't,
and it's not.

104
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:49,336
I have made no secret
of the fact

105
00:03:49,338 --> 00:03:51,672
that when necessary
I have been in contact

106
00:03:51,674 --> 00:03:54,007
with Green Arrow
and his team.

107
00:03:54,009 --> 00:03:56,343
He told me
about Laurel Lance.

108
00:03:56,345 --> 00:03:57,945
Well, I wasn't
talking to myself.

109
00:03:57,947 --> 00:03:59,446
Is that true,
Ms. Lance?

110
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:01,682
Ms. Lance, is Oliver Queen
the Green Arrow?

111
00:04:05,154 --> 00:04:08,455
I really do think that
Ms. Lance could--

112
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:10,057
could use some time
with her family

113
00:04:10,059 --> 00:04:11,725
and some privacy.

114
00:04:11,727 --> 00:04:12,693
Let's go.

115
00:04:12,695 --> 00:04:14,628
- Ms. Lance...
- Ms. Lance...

116
00:04:17,155 --> 00:04:21,155

118
00:04:28,844 --> 00:04:30,511
What do you think
you're doing?

119
00:04:30,513 --> 00:04:32,946
What? You said you
wanted me to be more like Laurel,

120
00:04:32,948 --> 00:04:34,481
so I thought I'd
give it a try.

121
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:36,183
Ohh. I really wish
I believed that.

122
00:04:36,185 --> 00:04:38,952
Where's the money you stole
from the city?

123
00:04:38,954 --> 00:04:41,955
Yeah. About that,
slight hiccup.

124
00:04:41,957 --> 00:04:44,992
So I went to where
I stashed it,

125
00:04:44,994 --> 00:04:46,894
and it's been
cleaned out.

126
00:04:46,896 --> 00:04:49,062
It's gone. Poof.

127
00:04:49,064 --> 00:04:50,731
So without the money,
you what--

128
00:04:50,733 --> 00:04:52,399
decided to become
Laurel Lance

129
00:04:52,401 --> 00:04:54,001
because she's
a public figure

130
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:55,736
and harder to kill?

131
00:04:55,738 --> 00:04:59,173
You're really that afraid
of Dinah Drake, aren't you?

132
00:04:59,175 --> 00:05:01,675
Not just afraid
of Dinah.

133
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:03,477
Afraid of whoever
manipulated Cayden James

134
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:05,279
into thinking
I killed his son.

135
00:05:05,281 --> 00:05:07,748
Because that's probably who
killed James, too.

136
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,218
Who did it--
Anatoly or Diaz?

137
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,520
Or you.

138
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:15,355
I mean, she could
have just easily killed

139
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:16,890
both of them.

140
00:05:16,892 --> 00:05:18,559
While I don't exactly
have an airtight alibi

141
00:05:18,561 --> 00:05:20,861
for Cayden,
I believe his son

142
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:23,697
was killed when I
was incarcerated at A.R.G.U.S.

143
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,365
Who did it?

144
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:28,202
Anatoly or Diaz?

145
00:05:28,204 --> 00:05:30,204
Talking out of school
will get me in trouble.

146
00:05:30,206 --> 00:05:32,039
Look. Whoever went
after James

147
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,374
is clearly coming
for you next,

148
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:36,076
so why don't you
cooperate with us?

149
00:05:36,078 --> 00:05:38,245
Help us find the money,
and maybe we can

150
00:05:38,247 --> 00:05:39,813
just protect you.

151
00:05:39,815 --> 00:05:42,249
Little trivia.

152
00:05:42,251 --> 00:05:43,917
There's a Thea Queen
on the earth

153
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,220
that I come
from, too,

154
00:05:46,222 --> 00:05:48,989
only she's not as pathetically
naive as you.

155
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:53,260
Look.
This is a lot simpler

156
00:05:53,262 --> 00:05:54,828
than you're making it.

157
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,129
You're gonna protect me,

158
00:05:56,131 --> 00:05:57,631
and you're going to
help protect me

159
00:05:57,633 --> 00:05:59,867
by going along
with this story that

160
00:05:59,869 --> 00:06:01,902
I'm the real
Laurel Lance.

161
00:06:01,904 --> 00:06:03,871
Yeah?

162
00:06:03,873 --> 00:06:05,405
Why would we
do that?

163
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:06,607
I don't know.

164
00:06:06,609 --> 00:06:08,375
Maybe because

165
00:06:08,377 --> 00:06:11,078
of all the reporters that
are just in the next room,

166
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,779
you know it's only
a matter of time

167
00:06:12,781 --> 00:06:16,884
before they ask me who
the Green Arrow is again.

168
00:06:16,886 --> 00:06:19,586
What would you like
me to tell them?

169
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,857
We're done here.

170
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:34,501
Mr. Mayor, may
I speak to you for a minute?

171
00:06:34,503 --> 00:06:36,203
Yes.

172
00:06:37,206 --> 00:06:38,672
What's all the fuss?

173
00:06:38,674 --> 00:06:40,908
Laurel Lance just
turned up...Alive.

174
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:43,010
Believe it or not,
she's actually--

175
00:06:43,012 --> 00:06:45,279
I know who she is.

176
00:06:45,281 --> 00:06:47,614
Sorry to pull you away,
but payday's Friday,

177
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:49,783
and my officers
aren't gonna get their checks.

178
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:51,285
Captain Hill,
I'm still working

179
00:06:51,287 --> 00:06:52,853
on recovering the money
that was extorted.

180
00:06:52,855 --> 00:06:54,187
And I have an idea
to buy us time

181
00:06:54,189 --> 00:06:55,822
that I wanted to
run past you.

182
00:06:55,824 --> 00:06:57,090
Let's hear it.

183
00:06:57,092 --> 00:06:58,692
The department has years
of seized assets--

184
00:06:58,694 --> 00:07:00,294
sports cars, mansions,

185
00:07:00,296 --> 00:07:01,862
even a stuffed polar bear,
if you can believe it.

186
00:07:01,864 --> 00:07:04,097
- Mm-hmm.
- At least 2/3 of the property

187
00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:06,199
has cleared
the court process for sale.

188
00:07:06,201 --> 00:07:08,135
If we auction it off,
we can raise

189
00:07:08,137 --> 00:07:09,870
as much as 30 million.

190
00:07:09,872 --> 00:07:13,040
30? Set that
in motion.

191
00:07:13,042 --> 00:07:16,043
That's--thank you.

192
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,880
- Hello.
- Don't talk to me.

193
00:07:19,882 --> 00:07:21,315
- Captain Hill.
- Mm-hmm.

194
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:22,849
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

195
00:07:22,851 --> 00:07:24,284
It's about Laurel Lance.

196
00:07:24,286 --> 00:07:25,452
That's a hell of a thing,
isn't it?

197
00:07:25,454 --> 00:07:27,054
She said they faked
her death

198
00:07:27,056 --> 00:07:28,255
and then she was held
captive for two years.

199
00:07:28,257 --> 00:07:29,856
Yeah, it sure is.

200
00:07:29,858 --> 00:07:31,525
Anyone catch
that case yet?

201
00:07:31,527 --> 00:07:33,627
You want it,
it's yours,

202
00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:35,662
but right now, she's
going to the hospital for a GSW.

203
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,431
I'm patient.

204
00:07:44,206 --> 00:07:46,740
- C-dawg!
- Hey, Zoe!

205
00:07:46,742 --> 00:07:48,275
Great. Love that that
name's sticking around.

206
00:07:48,277 --> 00:07:50,110
That's amazing!

207
00:07:50,112 --> 00:07:52,946
The babysitter had to go home
two hours ago.

208
00:07:52,948 --> 00:07:54,681
Where's my dad?

209
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:56,350
Have a seat.

210
00:07:57,953 --> 00:07:59,953
Something happened.

211
00:07:59,955 --> 00:08:01,488
He's gonna be ok,

212
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,590
but I need to
tell you about it.

213
00:08:05,928 --> 00:08:07,928
This is
inappropriate.

214
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:10,097
My motion should be
heard in open court.

215
00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:11,832
I requested
it be heard in chambers.

216
00:08:11,834 --> 00:08:13,333
Oh, to what,
hide the embarrassment

217
00:08:13,335 --> 00:08:15,535
of having your
case dismissed?

218
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:17,170
Actually, we're taking
Mr. Ramirez off our witness list.

219
00:08:17,172 --> 00:08:18,905
Considering he was
your sole witness

220
00:08:18,907 --> 00:08:21,608
against Mr. Queen, I renew my motion
to have this case--

221
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,011
- He's not our sole witness.
- What? No, no, no, no.

222
00:08:24,013 --> 00:08:26,179
Discovery on this case
is closed.

223
00:08:26,181 --> 00:08:28,048
This is newly discovered
information, your honor.

224
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,083
We'll make the witness'
proffer available to the defense

225
00:08:30,085 --> 00:08:31,985
in accordance
with "Brady v. Maryland."

226
00:08:31,987 --> 00:08:33,453
Who is the witness?

227
00:08:33,455 --> 00:08:35,422
Someone with enemies
on both sides of the law.

228
00:08:35,424 --> 00:08:36,957
That's why we're
doing this in chambers

229
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:38,425
and why I granted
the district attorney's

230
00:08:38,427 --> 00:08:40,260
request for
a suppression order.

231
00:08:40,262 --> 00:08:41,528
Right. I get it.
It's sensitive.

232
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:43,930
What is
the witness' name?

233
00:08:43,932 --> 00:08:45,732
Roy Harper.

234
00:08:49,926 --> 00:08:52,409
How did they
even find Roy?

235
00:08:52,509 --> 00:08:54,342
We didn't know
where he was.

236
00:08:54,344 --> 00:08:56,177
We didn't even know
what name he was working under.

237
00:08:56,179 --> 00:08:58,379
I didn't think
anybody did. Did--

238
00:08:58,381 --> 00:09:00,348
- Did you?
- No, no.

239
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:02,283
God. I couldn't even find him
for you guys' wedding reception.

240
00:09:02,285 --> 00:09:03,785
Doesn't matter
how they did it. They did.

241
00:09:03,787 --> 00:09:05,954
Now we have to figure out
what to do next.

242
00:09:05,956 --> 00:09:07,789
He's definitely not
cooperating voluntarily.

243
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,390
Well, it's been two years.
I mean, there might be

244
00:09:09,392 --> 00:09:11,025
some pressure points
that we don't know about,

245
00:09:11,027 --> 00:09:13,361
some people
he cares about, some--

246
00:09:13,363 --> 00:09:14,796
it's been a long time.

247
00:09:14,798 --> 00:09:16,431
Either way,
we need to know what Roy

248
00:09:16,433 --> 00:09:18,099
is going to say in court,

249
00:09:18,101 --> 00:09:20,335
which means we need
to know where he is right now.

250
00:09:20,337 --> 00:09:21,970
Oliver, he's
a state witness.

251
00:09:21,972 --> 00:09:23,938
I know our whole
thing is extralegal,

252
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,940
but maybe we should
let your lawyer deal with this.

253
00:09:25,942 --> 00:09:28,409
The DA's office does not
have the capabilities of finding Roy,

254
00:09:28,411 --> 00:09:32,447
which means this was
either Diaz or Anatoly.

255
00:09:32,449 --> 00:09:34,682
You think whoever's pulling strings
on this is still tugging them?

256
00:09:34,684 --> 00:09:36,518
Well, if you're
in the mood for some witness tampering,

257
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,520
I think I have a line
on where the DA is holding Roy.

258
00:09:38,522 --> 00:09:40,188
They've rented out
several rooms of the top floor

259
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,356
of a hotel downtown.

260
00:09:41,358 --> 00:09:42,991
Hotel--easily
guarded position

261
00:09:42,993 --> 00:09:44,526
with lots
of civilians.

262
00:09:44,528 --> 00:09:45,827
We break in,
get spotted, Oliver,

263
00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:47,662
we make their
case for them.

264
00:09:47,664 --> 00:09:49,430
Guys, if Ollie is right
and Roy is in trouble

265
00:09:49,432 --> 00:09:54,035
with Diaz or Anatoly,
we need to be protecting him.

266
00:09:54,037 --> 00:09:56,004
So we wait until dark
to do recon

267
00:09:56,006 --> 00:10:00,108
and then find
possible points of entry.

268
00:10:02,445 --> 00:10:04,279
No exertion
or sudden movements.

269
00:10:04,281 --> 00:10:07,148
Don't want
to risk reopening the wound.

270
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,750
Ahem.

271
00:10:08,752 --> 00:10:11,886
Hey. Uh, could--could you
give us a minute, please?

272
00:10:14,624 --> 00:10:16,424
What, is mom coming
to visit or something?

273
00:10:16,426 --> 00:10:20,228
Ok. Firstly, she's not your
mom, and second, no.

274
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,330
I caught her right
after your little performance

275
00:10:22,332 --> 00:10:24,032
for the cameras and told her to
hold off for a bit

276
00:10:24,034 --> 00:10:25,767
while I checked
you out.

277
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:28,503
That poor woman's been burned enough
by this sort of thing.

278
00:10:28,505 --> 00:10:31,072
More of Laurel's stuff.

279
00:10:31,074 --> 00:10:33,775
And I was just getting
used to the last outfit.

280
00:10:33,777 --> 00:10:35,310
Well, forensics
has that one.

281
00:10:35,312 --> 00:10:38,780
Anyway, you want to
pass for the real Laurel,

282
00:10:38,782 --> 00:10:40,648
you better get used
to her style.

283
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:43,218
You call this...Style?

284
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,819
Look. Are you here
just to make sure

285
00:10:44,821 --> 00:10:46,588
my health insurance
is up to date,

286
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,690
or are you here to
protect me from her?

287
00:10:51,528 --> 00:10:53,628
Just get dressed.

288
00:11:00,103 --> 00:11:02,003
Hey.

289
00:11:02,005 --> 00:11:05,273
Laurel Lance--she died
in this hospital.

290
00:11:05,275 --> 00:11:08,443
I pronounced her.
There was an autopsy.

291
00:11:08,445 --> 00:11:10,778
Of course, I've seen
my share of things

292
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:13,281
I once would have
considered miraculous.

293
00:11:13,283 --> 00:11:16,451
I mean, in a world where a man
can run faster than light,

294
00:11:16,453 --> 00:11:18,419
I suppose anything's
possible.

295
00:11:18,421 --> 00:11:19,988
That's why I need
to rule out the chance

296
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,522
that this person
could be an imposter.

297
00:11:21,524 --> 00:11:22,857
The DNA test
will tell us that.

298
00:11:22,859 --> 00:11:24,659
Code blue,
room 317.

299
00:11:24,661 --> 00:11:26,728
Excuse me.

300
00:11:28,665 --> 00:11:30,832
- Hey.
- Hey.

301
00:11:30,834 --> 00:11:33,067
Look. I know what
you're doing here, all right?

302
00:11:33,069 --> 00:11:34,702
You're going after Laurel
because of what happened to your friend,

303
00:11:34,704 --> 00:11:36,137
and I get that, ok?

304
00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:37,672
It's what I would do

305
00:11:37,674 --> 00:11:39,907
if someone I loved
was dead.

306
00:11:39,909 --> 00:11:41,442
You mean, it's just
what you'd do with a criminal, Quentin,

307
00:11:41,444 --> 00:11:42,977
which, by the way,
is what she is.

308
00:11:42,979 --> 00:11:45,079
Yeah. Well, you and I
both know that,

309
00:11:45,081 --> 00:11:48,082
but, you know, she's turned herself into
a beloved public figure.

310
00:11:48,084 --> 00:11:51,552
She's also said
that she's got no compunctions

311
00:11:51,554 --> 00:11:53,488
about outing
Oliver, and...

312
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,491
I don't think she'll
stop with him.

313
00:11:56,493 --> 00:11:57,659
Oh. So you're doing this
for my sake?

314
00:11:57,661 --> 00:11:59,527
No. For all
of our sakes.

315
00:11:59,529 --> 00:12:01,663
I've been making
progress with her, Dinah, ok?

316
00:12:01,665 --> 00:12:05,500
I'm not finished,
but if she lives as my Laurel--

317
00:12:05,502 --> 00:12:08,469
she is not your Laurel.

318
00:12:08,471 --> 00:12:11,506
Your Laurel wouldn't
have murdered Vince or anyone else.

319
00:12:11,508 --> 00:12:14,609
She did,
and you are delusional

320
00:12:14,611 --> 00:12:15,743
if you think
you can change her.

321
00:12:15,745 --> 00:12:17,078
No. I'm telling you

322
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,913
I've been changing
her, ok?

323
00:12:18,915 --> 00:12:21,616
All I'm asking from you
is just a chance.

324
00:12:21,618 --> 00:12:23,618
Please.

325
00:12:25,088 --> 00:12:26,921
What's taking her so long?

326
00:12:33,196 --> 00:12:34,362
Where'd she go?

327
00:12:34,364 --> 00:12:35,863
The police officer
took her,

328
00:12:35,865 --> 00:12:37,565
said something
about a safe house.

329
00:12:37,567 --> 00:12:40,301
No, no. I am
the lead detective on this case.

330
00:12:45,308 --> 00:12:46,674
You did this.

331
00:12:46,676 --> 00:12:48,343
What are you
talking about?

332
00:12:48,345 --> 00:12:50,378
I want to know
where she is, too, you know.

333
00:12:57,987 --> 00:13:00,221
Is my father not coming?

334
00:13:03,393 --> 00:13:04,992
Where are you
taking me?

335
00:13:04,994 --> 00:13:06,761
To see Mr. Diaz.

336
00:13:17,607 --> 00:13:20,675
Guessing Roy's
in the room with the police outside.

337
00:13:20,677 --> 00:13:25,646
Yeah, reading the wrong
end of a phone book.

338
00:13:25,648 --> 00:13:27,148
It's risky terrain.

339
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,716
You just told me he's
getting beaten on.

340
00:13:28,718 --> 00:13:30,385
You still not sure
we should do this?

341
00:13:30,387 --> 00:13:32,253
Two-man team
on the balcony.

342
00:13:32,255 --> 00:13:34,288
If we can get
past them, that's our best bet.

343
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:36,157
John, he's in there
because of me.

344
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:37,658
He's been on the run
for 3 years.

345
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,427
Oliver, that's
his choice.

346
00:13:39,429 --> 00:13:41,796
I know that, but did I learn
anything from it?

347
00:13:41,798 --> 00:13:43,664
Roy put on the hood.

348
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:47,001
He sacrificed himself
for me,

349
00:13:47,003 --> 00:13:48,636
and I asked you to do
the same thing

350
00:13:48,638 --> 00:13:51,005
at the expense of your safety
and your family.

351
00:13:51,007 --> 00:13:52,807
Difference was
I wanted

352
00:13:52,809 --> 00:13:54,609
to put on the hood,
Oliver.

353
00:13:54,611 --> 00:13:56,411
Listen. I've been good
for the past two months--

354
00:13:56,413 --> 00:13:59,013
good--but instead
of giving me back the hood,

355
00:13:59,015 --> 00:14:00,681
you've had Cisco
make me a new suit.

356
00:14:00,683 --> 00:14:02,717
There it is.
There's a 15-second opening.

357
00:14:02,719 --> 00:14:04,619
That is our window.

358
00:14:18,735 --> 00:14:20,468
We got her from here.

359
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:22,870
Head back to SCPD
before you're missed.

360
00:14:22,872 --> 00:14:25,706
Laurel,
s vozvrashcheniyem.

361
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:28,876
Is it Laurel
or Laurel these days?

362
00:14:28,878 --> 00:14:31,646
So confusing this
doppelganger business,

363
00:14:31,648 --> 00:14:33,648
but you seem to
figure it out.

364
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:37,218
- Diaz killed Cayden.
- He told me.

365
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,053
No honor
among thieves

366
00:14:39,055 --> 00:14:41,088
or crime lords,
I guess.

367
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,690
Oh, well.

368
00:14:42,692 --> 00:14:44,058
Diaz manipulated

369
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,860
the both of us,
lied to the both of us.

370
00:14:45,862 --> 00:14:47,695
This whole time,
he's had his own agenda.

371
00:14:47,697 --> 00:14:49,664
That doesn't bother you?

372
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:51,432
I'm not sentimental.

373
00:14:51,434 --> 00:14:52,800
I am Russian.

374
00:14:52,802 --> 00:14:55,336
I am in this city
for two reasons only.

375
00:14:55,338 --> 00:14:59,841
One is revenge
against Oliver Queen,

376
00:14:59,843 --> 00:15:02,376
and two is money.

377
00:15:02,378 --> 00:15:04,979
I'm happy to work
with whoever can get me either.

378
00:15:04,981 --> 00:15:08,382
You're in this city
because the Bratva cast you out.

379
00:15:08,384 --> 00:15:10,518
Well, there's
that, too.

380
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,757
There is a 15-second window
where neither roof guard

381
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:18,326
is watching
the HVAC vent.

382
00:15:18,328 --> 00:15:19,760
- We can get in that way.
- All right.

383
00:15:19,762 --> 00:15:21,229
Well, did you see him?
Is he ok?

384
00:15:21,231 --> 00:15:22,864
We can get
him out.

385
00:15:22,866 --> 00:15:25,466
I know,
and I'm coming with you.

386
00:15:26,769 --> 00:15:28,302
I thought you didn't
do this anymore.

387
00:15:28,304 --> 00:15:29,904
Ollie, it's Roy.

388
00:15:29,906 --> 00:15:31,739
Right, but, Thea,
you shouldn't do this,

389
00:15:31,741 --> 00:15:33,674
and I understand it's hypocritical
pointing out that

390
00:15:33,676 --> 00:15:35,276
you have a personal
involvement.

391
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:37,578
Doesn't make me
wrong.

392
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,046
More importantly,

393
00:15:39,048 --> 00:15:40,548
you have not
been field ready

394
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,983
since you got out
of your coma.

395
00:15:41,985 --> 00:15:43,784
I'll be fine, ok,

396
00:15:43,786 --> 00:15:45,753
and did you guys even
measure the vents?

397
00:15:45,755 --> 00:15:47,588
Because you should be
asking if I'm the right size

398
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,123
to fit through them.

399
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:50,691
Don't think either
of you two can.

400
00:15:50,693 --> 00:15:52,793
Where are you guys
keeping my suit?

401
00:15:55,465 --> 00:15:57,064
You ok?

402
00:15:57,066 --> 00:15:58,966
It's just like
riding a bike.

403
00:15:58,968 --> 00:16:00,735
It really isn't.

404
00:16:00,737 --> 00:16:03,104
I can buy you
a few extra seconds.

405
00:16:03,106 --> 00:16:06,340
- I'm ready.
- All right.

406
00:16:11,981 --> 00:16:13,481
What's that for?

407
00:16:13,483 --> 00:16:15,950
There's not a home game
tonight, is there?

408
00:16:38,141 --> 00:16:40,174
Unh! Agh!

409
00:16:40,176 --> 00:16:41,842
Want to keep
going,

410
00:16:41,844 --> 00:16:44,245
or you gonna
testify?

411
00:16:44,247 --> 00:16:45,813
You know, I'm not
a lawyer,

412
00:16:45,815 --> 00:16:47,648
but I'm pretty sure
torturing your witness

413
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:49,750
isn't gonna be great
for your case.

414
00:16:49,752 --> 00:16:52,853
You don't think we know how to
put you in a world of hurt

415
00:16:52,855 --> 00:16:54,989
without leaving
a mark?

416
00:16:58,895 --> 00:17:00,561
No. Ohh!

417
00:17:00,563 --> 00:17:01,862
Unh!

418
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:07,301
Ugh! Agh!

419
00:17:08,871 --> 00:17:10,471
Are you getting this?

420
00:17:10,473 --> 00:17:12,607
I'm enhancing
their badge numbers.

421
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:15,610
Just when you thought Oliver took down
all the crooked cops last year.

422
00:17:15,612 --> 00:17:17,345
- I'm going in.
- I wouldn't.

423
00:17:17,347 --> 00:17:18,946
They got 6 more guys
in the hall.

424
00:17:18,948 --> 00:17:20,514
Stand down.
I know it's hard,

425
00:17:20,516 --> 00:17:22,016
but you have to wait.

426
00:17:22,018 --> 00:17:23,985
Unh!

427
00:17:23,987 --> 00:17:25,086
Ugh!

428
00:17:26,823 --> 00:17:29,690
I'm working up
an appetite here.

429
00:17:29,692 --> 00:17:33,761
Hey. We're gonna get
some Big Belly Burger.

430
00:17:33,763 --> 00:17:36,364
You decide to play nice,
I might give you the fries.

431
00:17:50,013 --> 00:17:52,947
Is that my hood?

432
00:17:52,949 --> 00:17:54,782
It looks good on you.

433
00:18:01,924 --> 00:18:04,925
I--I'm sorry if
you're seeing someone--

434
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,694
I'm not. I didn't
take your advice.

435
00:18:06,696 --> 00:18:11,399
No kids, no wife,
and I really, really hate minivans.

436
00:18:11,401 --> 00:18:13,501
How did they find you?

437
00:18:13,503 --> 00:18:16,470
I was in St. Roche,
and the Star City cops,

438
00:18:16,472 --> 00:18:18,439
they tased me, and they threw me
in the back of a Van.

439
00:18:18,441 --> 00:18:20,408
They knew everything.
They knew about Oliver,

440
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:21,776
they knew about me
faking my death,

441
00:18:21,778 --> 00:18:22,977
they--they knew it all.

442
00:18:22,979 --> 00:18:25,546
SCPD SWAT incoming.

443
00:18:25,548 --> 00:18:26,981
Speedy, you want to
get out of there now.

444
00:18:26,983 --> 00:18:28,816
Speedy, move!

445
00:18:29,986 --> 00:18:32,286
Ok. We're leaving.

446
00:18:32,288 --> 00:18:33,854
No.
You're leaving.

447
00:18:33,856 --> 00:18:35,389
I'm in no shape to be
swinging from rooftops.

448
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,991
- Ohh.
- I'm not leaving without you.

449
00:18:36,993 --> 00:18:38,559
Agh.

450
00:18:38,561 --> 00:18:39,593
They're coming in hot!

451
00:18:39,595 --> 00:18:41,195
You got to go
right now.

452
00:18:41,197 --> 00:18:42,963
Damn it, Speedy!
Get out of there!

453
00:18:42,965 --> 00:18:44,865
- I'm getting you out of here.
- No, no, you can't.

454
00:18:44,867 --> 00:18:46,867
- You have to go.
- No. I'm not leaving you.

455
00:18:46,869 --> 00:18:48,002
Speedy, they're
right outside the door!

456
00:18:49,539 --> 00:18:52,006
I'm not losing
you again.

457
00:18:52,008 --> 00:18:53,708
SWAT team in position.

458
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:54,975
- Just go sit.
- Thea!

459
00:19:05,922 --> 00:19:07,955
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

460
00:19:07,957 --> 00:19:09,590
I needed some air.

461
00:19:09,592 --> 00:19:11,959
You're gonna need air.

462
00:19:13,262 --> 00:19:14,962
What the hell did you
just do?

463
00:19:14,964 --> 00:19:16,430
I just saved
your life!

464
00:19:16,432 --> 00:19:17,965
There was too many
of them in there.

465
00:19:17,967 --> 00:19:19,700
They would have
killed you both.

466
00:19:19,702 --> 00:19:23,304
Look. We will
get Roy back.

467
00:19:23,306 --> 00:19:25,072
I am promising you.

468
00:19:25,074 --> 00:19:27,108
We will get him back.

469
00:19:34,638 --> 00:19:36,170
They're really circling
the wagons now.

470
00:19:36,172 --> 00:19:38,039
They've
upped security tenfold.

471
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,874
He was bleeding internally,
so if we don't get to him soon,

472
00:19:39,876 --> 00:19:41,743
- they're going to kill him.
- They will not

473
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:44,498
because they need him alive
to testify against me.

474
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,467
- Not they. Diaz.
- I pulled financials

475
00:19:46,469 --> 00:19:48,514
on both the police officers
that were torturing Roy.

476
00:19:48,516 --> 00:19:50,649
They both receive
generous dividend payments

477
00:19:50,651 --> 00:19:53,051
from stocks in a Corto Maltese-based
shell corporation.

478
00:19:53,053 --> 00:19:54,787
It financed a company
that was manufacturing

479
00:19:54,789 --> 00:19:57,489
the drug I used
to treat my injury,

480
00:19:57,491 --> 00:19:59,758
Ricardo Diaz's
company.

481
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,393
Both officers were
on duty when Cayden James was killed,

482
00:20:01,395 --> 00:20:03,061
and all the officers
that were there tonight,

483
00:20:03,063 --> 00:20:05,597
we have reason to believe,
are working with Diaz, too.

484
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:07,466
So Diaz has been
playing us since the beginning.

485
00:20:07,468 --> 00:20:09,835
Or he's just been
playing you.

486
00:20:14,341 --> 00:20:16,909
She's upset.
She's worried about Roy.

487
00:20:16,911 --> 00:20:18,677
Yeah. So am I.

488
00:20:21,682 --> 00:20:23,415
I had to pull
you out of there.

489
00:20:23,417 --> 00:20:25,150
No. You--you could
have come in.

490
00:20:25,152 --> 00:20:27,019
I come in there,
and it's you and me

491
00:20:27,021 --> 00:20:29,087
against a SWAT team
in a tight space.

492
00:20:29,089 --> 00:20:31,156
Nobody comes out
of there,

493
00:20:31,158 --> 00:20:32,791
especially not Roy.

494
00:20:34,428 --> 00:20:37,029
You know, there are times

495
00:20:37,031 --> 00:20:40,299
that I feel like my life
completely fell apart

496
00:20:40,301 --> 00:20:41,934
when Roy left--

497
00:20:41,936 --> 00:20:47,339
from my bloodlust
to Malcolm to the coma.

498
00:20:47,341 --> 00:20:51,410
Knowing he was
out there, that he was ok,

499
00:20:51,412 --> 00:20:55,113
it made my life just
a little bit easier.

500
00:20:55,115 --> 00:20:57,449
Ever since mom died,
I haven't known much

501
00:20:57,451 --> 00:20:59,585
of anything other than
the fact that I want to

502
00:20:59,587 --> 00:21:01,520
make sure he is safe,
and I will do

503
00:21:01,522 --> 00:21:04,056
whatever it takes
to make sure that happens.

504
00:21:04,058 --> 00:21:06,058
We all will, Speedy.

505
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,926
Felicity may
have just found something.

506
00:21:07,928 --> 00:21:10,896
SCPD just requisitioned
a transport prison Van.

507
00:21:10,898 --> 00:21:12,497
They're moving Roy
to a new safe house.

508
00:21:12,499 --> 00:21:14,166
We just don't know when.

509
00:21:14,168 --> 00:21:15,634
That's it.

510
00:21:15,636 --> 00:21:17,402
That's when
we get him.

511
00:21:17,404 --> 00:21:19,271
There's something else.

512
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:22,541
No, no, no, no.
Ok. You know what?

513
00:21:22,543 --> 00:21:24,343
Who can tell me
where Laurel Lance is?

514
00:21:24,345 --> 00:21:26,378
Can you tell me that?

515
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:29,248
And when will he
be available?

516
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,183
No, no, no, no.
No, thank you.

517
00:21:31,185 --> 00:21:32,384
I'll call back.

518
00:21:32,386 --> 00:21:34,720
I swear this isn't
me, all right?

519
00:21:34,722 --> 00:21:37,189
I need to speak
with you.

520
00:21:37,191 --> 00:21:39,091
You, too.

521
00:21:50,037 --> 00:21:51,837
Turn the cameras off.

522
00:21:56,810 --> 00:22:01,914
Cayden James was murdered
right there by Ricardo Diaz.

523
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:03,348
Oh, my God.

524
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,817
And it was covered up
by the SCPD.

525
00:22:05,819 --> 00:22:08,153
I thought Cayden James
was killed

526
00:22:08,155 --> 00:22:10,822
by another inmate
on his transfer to Iron Heights.

527
00:22:10,824 --> 00:22:13,191
Felicity found out
what actually happened.

528
00:22:13,193 --> 00:22:15,127
Never made it
to Iron Heights.

529
00:22:15,129 --> 00:22:18,297
The cops on duty
are on Diaz's payroll.

530
00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:20,032
They faked
the transfer.

531
00:22:20,034 --> 00:22:22,634
- Doing that would take--
- A systemic breach

532
00:22:22,636 --> 00:22:25,037
of the police
department,

533
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,605
worse than last year's
corruption.

534
00:22:26,607 --> 00:22:28,240
I didn't think that
was even possible.

535
00:22:28,242 --> 00:22:30,108
Neither did I.

536
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:32,911
Dinah, I know that you
don't believe in me right now,

537
00:22:32,913 --> 00:22:35,213
and I know the two
of you don't trust each other

538
00:22:35,215 --> 00:22:38,984
for good reason,
but the both of you believe

539
00:22:38,986 --> 00:22:40,285
in the badge.

540
00:22:40,287 --> 00:22:41,987
I need you working
together.

541
00:22:41,989 --> 00:22:43,855
I need
to know how deep this goes.

542
00:22:43,857 --> 00:22:48,160
I need to know who
in that room we can trust,

543
00:22:48,162 --> 00:22:50,429
which means you got to
put your vendetta on hold.

544
00:22:54,134 --> 00:22:57,269
- Ok.
- We can work out of my place.

545
00:22:57,271 --> 00:22:59,237
Walls here got ears.

546
00:22:59,239 --> 00:23:01,173
And this is why
I couldn't find Laurel

547
00:23:01,175 --> 00:23:02,975
because those
bent cops sprung her.

548
00:23:02,977 --> 00:23:05,210
Or they took her
someplace worse.

549
00:23:07,448 --> 00:23:11,149
Diaz's feelings
were so hurt when you tried to run.

550
00:23:11,151 --> 00:23:13,018
It's as if you don't
trust him or something.

551
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,253
I'm still trying to
figure out why you do.

552
00:23:15,255 --> 00:23:18,290
Hmm. For me, it's more
matter of money than trust.

553
00:23:18,292 --> 00:23:20,225
Either way, Diaz better.

554
00:23:20,227 --> 00:23:23,261
Why blow up city
when you can, uh, control it, yes?

555
00:23:53,527 --> 00:23:55,627
You're as good
as they said you were.

556
00:23:57,965 --> 00:24:00,932
But you know that
fighting for trophies--

557
00:24:00,934 --> 00:24:04,636
not the same as fighting
for your life.

558
00:24:04,638 --> 00:24:07,406
We'll break you
of your bad habits.

559
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:12,077
Welcome to the team.

560
00:24:13,714 --> 00:24:16,681
That's a lot of money
for man with bad foot.

561
00:24:16,683 --> 00:24:18,750
I didn't break it.

562
00:24:18,752 --> 00:24:20,986
I just had to
break him.

563
00:24:26,994 --> 00:24:29,628
Building a family,
Anatoly.

564
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:33,498
Family. Isn't that what,

565
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,367
uh, Bratva means,

566
00:24:35,369 --> 00:24:36,601
brotherhood?

567
00:24:36,603 --> 00:24:38,737
Da.

568
00:24:38,739 --> 00:24:43,008
See, family, they
rely on one another.

569
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:46,311
Family trust each other.

570
00:24:46,313 --> 00:24:48,113
See, when the family
does well,

571
00:24:48,115 --> 00:24:51,716
each member
prospers,

572
00:24:51,718 --> 00:24:55,387
but if just one person

573
00:24:55,389 --> 00:24:58,690
betrays that family...

574
00:25:01,495 --> 00:25:04,463
Give us the room! Move!

575
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:08,166
Udachi.

576
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:16,174
The money that you
stole from Cayden

577
00:25:16,176 --> 00:25:18,310
was also my money.

578
00:25:18,312 --> 00:25:21,346
I earned it
just like you

579
00:25:21,348 --> 00:25:23,615
except I didn't take
more than my share.

580
00:25:23,617 --> 00:25:25,750
Well, you've got it
all back, obviously,

581
00:25:25,752 --> 00:25:27,385
so why am I here?

582
00:25:27,387 --> 00:25:28,887
It's because our business
has not concluded.

583
00:25:28,889 --> 00:25:30,622
You might have
convinced Anatoly

584
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:32,157
that you're worth
staying in bed with,

585
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:33,825
but I have
a psycho vigilante

586
00:25:33,827 --> 00:25:35,427
coming after me.

587
00:25:35,429 --> 00:25:38,396
Dinah Drake. Hmm?

588
00:25:38,398 --> 00:25:41,733
I see all.
I know all.

589
00:25:41,735 --> 00:25:43,735
I control it all.

590
00:25:43,737 --> 00:25:46,204
I've been working
on this for months.

591
00:25:46,206 --> 00:25:48,673
See, Cayden, he's just
a small piece

592
00:25:48,675 --> 00:25:53,445
of a much larger puzzle,
and so are you.

593
00:25:53,447 --> 00:25:55,046
I just want to get
the hell out of this city.

594
00:25:55,048 --> 00:25:57,782
Where do you want
to go?

595
00:25:57,784 --> 00:25:59,484
Hmm? Do what?

596
00:25:59,486 --> 00:26:05,190
Live without always
having to look over my shoulder.

597
00:26:07,694 --> 00:26:10,395
I don't want you to worry
about Dinah Drake.

598
00:26:10,397 --> 00:26:15,267
I don't want you to worry about
Oliver Queen or any of those chumps

599
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:18,403
who can't see two inches
past their face.

600
00:26:18,405 --> 00:26:23,475
Anatoly said that you
had a plan to take control of this city.

601
00:26:23,477 --> 00:26:25,377
Now, isn't that something...

602
00:26:29,716 --> 00:26:32,250
Worth staying in bed for?

603
00:26:37,324 --> 00:26:39,925
I don't know, Felicity.

604
00:26:39,927 --> 00:26:43,061
Maybe it's a little soon bringing up
taking back the mantle from Oliver,

605
00:26:43,063 --> 00:26:44,596
but it's been two months.

606
00:26:44,598 --> 00:26:46,364
A hell of a two
months, though,

607
00:26:46,366 --> 00:26:48,033
and Oliver's just not
ready to step down,

608
00:26:48,035 --> 00:26:49,568
not with everything
that's going on.

609
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:51,670
It's too much.
It's crazy--

610
00:26:53,207 --> 00:26:55,407
They're moving Roy
in 10 minutes.

611
00:27:07,854 --> 00:27:09,120
Don't move.

612
00:27:09,122 --> 00:27:11,823
Roy, back away
from the door!

613
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:20,732
It's a decoy.

614
00:27:20,734 --> 00:27:22,400
They faked Cayden
James' transfer.

615
00:27:22,402 --> 00:27:23,802
They faked
this one, too!

616
00:27:23,804 --> 00:27:25,604
So where is Roy?

617
00:27:28,609 --> 00:27:32,944
Mr. Harper, it's
good to meet you.

618
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:41,875
You said that they
were moving him.

619
00:27:41,877 --> 00:27:43,677
Yeah. They must have put Roy
into a different vehicle

620
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:44,401
when they were
in the underground

621
00:27:44,402 --> 00:27:45,578
and I didn't have
eyes on them.

622
00:27:45,579 --> 00:27:47,538
Which means he could have
been picked up at any point last night.

623
00:27:47,562 --> 00:27:49,362
How many cars
left the hotel in that timeframe?

624
00:27:49,364 --> 00:27:51,887
Nearly 300. I'm tracking license
plate numbers,

625
00:27:51,889 --> 00:27:53,855
but it's gonna
take some time.

626
00:27:53,857 --> 00:27:55,924
If it takes more than an hour,
I'm gonna start breaking fingers.

627
00:27:55,926 --> 00:27:58,881
There's that Queen temper.
I'll contact Lyla,

628
00:27:58,882 --> 00:28:01,616
see if A.R.G.U.S. can
help with finding Roy.

629
00:28:05,088 --> 00:28:06,988
How are you
holding up?

630
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:09,124
- I've been better.
- Yeah, I know.

631
00:28:09,126 --> 00:28:11,226
It's because you're blaming yourself
for Roy's situation

632
00:28:11,228 --> 00:28:13,342
instead of accurately
blaming Ricardo Diaz.

633
00:28:13,343 --> 00:28:15,143
Well, Roy wouldn't be
in this situation

634
00:28:15,145 --> 00:28:17,612
if he didn't fall
on his sword for me 3 years ago.

635
00:28:17,614 --> 00:28:19,481
That was his choice,
Oliver,

636
00:28:19,483 --> 00:28:22,150
and I believed then--
and I still believe-- it was the right one.

637
00:28:22,152 --> 00:28:25,431
I'm worried that I didn't rescue him
from that hotel room

638
00:28:25,433 --> 00:28:27,833
because I wouldn't have been able
to bear the responsibility

639
00:28:27,835 --> 00:28:29,335
if things went bad.

640
00:28:29,337 --> 00:28:31,003
You didn't go
into that hotel room

641
00:28:31,005 --> 00:28:32,571
because your gut
told you

642
00:28:32,573 --> 00:28:33,806
things would go bad,
and that gut's

643
00:28:33,808 --> 00:28:35,407
kept you alive
for 11 years,

644
00:28:35,409 --> 00:28:36,809
and it kept Roy
alive last night.

645
00:28:36,811 --> 00:28:38,644
Maybe. How do I know?

646
00:28:38,646 --> 00:28:41,780
I could ask Cisco to find a parallel
universe in which you did,

647
00:28:41,782 --> 00:28:45,250
but in the meantime,
if you could just stop finding ways

648
00:28:45,252 --> 00:28:49,054
to blame yourself,
that would be so great.

649
00:28:49,056 --> 00:28:50,623
Is that what I'm doing?

650
00:28:50,625 --> 00:28:52,324
That's what you're
always doing.

651
00:28:52,326 --> 00:28:54,293
- Well, maybe you have a point.
- Hmm.

652
00:28:54,295 --> 00:28:56,695
Last night, John
basically asked me

653
00:28:56,697 --> 00:28:58,664
why I haven't given
him the hood back.

654
00:28:58,666 --> 00:29:00,699
Yeah, I know. He told me.
I told him you probably

655
00:29:00,701 --> 00:29:02,635
just thought it
wasn't the right time.

656
00:29:02,637 --> 00:29:04,737
Am I on the money?

657
00:29:04,739 --> 00:29:06,672
I don't know.

658
00:29:09,944 --> 00:29:14,313
You have a strength
one doesn't see much.

659
00:29:17,284 --> 00:29:19,485
You want to
join my team?

660
00:29:19,487 --> 00:29:23,822
Sure. Do you offer
medical and dental?

661
00:29:23,824 --> 00:29:28,861
You know, my police friends are
telling me you're not cooperating.

662
00:29:28,863 --> 00:29:30,729
You're not playing ball!

663
00:29:30,731 --> 00:29:32,998
You won't testify
against Queen.

664
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,435
If you actually think
that I would do that, you're an idiot.

665
00:29:36,437 --> 00:29:38,937
Yeah. One of us is.

666
00:29:38,939 --> 00:29:41,006
See, but I'm not
the type of guy that believes

667
00:29:41,008 --> 00:29:43,275
giving a beating...

668
00:29:44,879 --> 00:29:48,781
is the only way
to cause some pain.

669
00:29:53,554 --> 00:29:55,354
How's Speedy?

670
00:29:57,091 --> 00:30:00,059
She came out
of retirement.

671
00:30:00,061 --> 00:30:02,327
Why would she do that?

672
00:30:02,329 --> 00:30:06,532
Why the hell would Queen
let his baby sister

673
00:30:06,534 --> 00:30:09,802
dress up like
will Scarlet?

674
00:30:09,804 --> 00:30:12,805
I mean, I got to ask--

675
00:30:12,807 --> 00:30:14,740
eh, it's a moot point.

676
00:30:17,878 --> 00:30:20,412
You see, the real
question is...

677
00:30:23,918 --> 00:30:27,519
Who do I got to bring
the pain to?

678
00:30:27,521 --> 00:30:29,755
Do I got to bring
it to you...

679
00:30:32,827 --> 00:30:34,560
Or her?

680
00:30:42,369 --> 00:30:43,969
Shift sergeant was
definitely in on it.

681
00:30:43,971 --> 00:30:45,437
Look at this.

682
00:30:45,439 --> 00:30:48,340
Diaz has got
his fingers in deep.

683
00:30:48,342 --> 00:30:51,810
Listen. Thanks
for doing this, all right,

684
00:30:51,812 --> 00:30:53,345
backing off Laurel.

685
00:30:53,347 --> 00:30:54,913
It's temporary

686
00:30:54,915 --> 00:30:56,849
until we can get the department back
under control.

687
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:05,357
- Hi, daddy.
- Hi.

688
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:08,026
Speak of the devil.

689
00:31:08,028 --> 00:31:09,394
Can I talk to you?

690
00:31:09,396 --> 00:31:10,996
Yeah. I've got a lot
I'd like to say.

691
00:31:10,998 --> 00:31:13,232
Can we not do
the whole screaming thing?

692
00:31:13,234 --> 00:31:14,833
Because the only thing
that's gonna happen is

693
00:31:14,835 --> 00:31:16,802
my father's gonna have to
renovate his apartment,

694
00:31:16,804 --> 00:31:19,772
plus I'm here
about Ricardo Diaz.

695
00:31:24,345 --> 00:31:26,612
I'd ask how you're
doing, but...

696
00:31:28,015 --> 00:31:30,182
Felicity and A.R.G.U.S.
are working

697
00:31:30,184 --> 00:31:32,184
on locating Roy.

698
00:31:34,822 --> 00:31:36,622
You know, it's been a while
since I offered you

699
00:31:36,624 --> 00:31:39,658
a little
big brother advice.

700
00:31:40,895 --> 00:31:42,961
Do you mind?

701
00:31:44,665 --> 00:31:46,832
This should be good.

702
00:31:46,834 --> 00:31:48,801
When we find Roy--

703
00:31:48,803 --> 00:31:52,638
not if but when
we find Roy...

704
00:31:54,341 --> 00:31:56,875
I think maybe you
should go with him.

705
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,514
- Where?
- Wherever he's going.

706
00:32:02,516 --> 00:32:06,785
I mean, I-- Thea, I'd miss you
like--like crazy,

707
00:32:06,787 --> 00:32:10,823
but you said that you haven't been
the same without him,

708
00:32:10,825 --> 00:32:13,392
so maybe you shouldn't
be without him.

709
00:32:13,394 --> 00:32:15,294
You really think
I should go?

710
00:32:15,296 --> 00:32:17,529
I don't want you
to go, obviously,

711
00:32:17,531 --> 00:32:20,899
but you've seen what--
what having Felicity

712
00:32:20,901 --> 00:32:23,001
in my life
has done for me.

713
00:32:23,003 --> 00:32:27,706
You deserve that same kind of
happiness, Speedy,

714
00:32:27,708 --> 00:32:29,374
wherever it is.

715
00:32:30,678 --> 00:32:32,044
Got news!

716
00:32:32,046 --> 00:32:34,213
Location on Roy?

717
00:32:34,215 --> 00:32:35,414
Laurel. She showed up
at Lance's apartment

718
00:32:35,416 --> 00:32:37,716
with Intel
on Ricardo Diaz.

719
00:32:45,226 --> 00:32:48,026
He has some plan
to take over the city,

720
00:32:48,028 --> 00:32:49,494
whatever that means.

721
00:32:49,496 --> 00:32:51,530
I don't exactly
have details.

722
00:32:51,532 --> 00:32:54,233
No. He just let you leave
after you stole all that money,

723
00:32:54,235 --> 00:32:57,936
let you come over here and tell
us all of this.

724
00:32:57,938 --> 00:33:01,473
Well, I'm rather charming,
don't you think?

725
00:33:01,475 --> 00:33:03,342
So where's Roy?

726
00:33:03,344 --> 00:33:05,911
They had him brought
to some run-down casino.

727
00:33:05,913 --> 00:33:07,913
I heard some guys
talking about it on my way out.

728
00:33:07,915 --> 00:33:09,448
I can take you there.

729
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:11,049
So Diaz can take
these guys out?

730
00:33:11,051 --> 00:33:12,851
Is that part
of the plan?

731
00:33:12,853 --> 00:33:14,353
Look. We really
don't have a choice, ok?

732
00:33:14,355 --> 00:33:15,954
We need to take
this chance.

733
00:33:15,956 --> 00:33:17,322
All right.
Why are you doing this, huh,

734
00:33:17,324 --> 00:33:19,057
going against Diaz?

735
00:33:19,059 --> 00:33:22,895
Because it occurred to me
that if I'm gonna be Laurel,

736
00:33:22,897 --> 00:33:25,597
I should probably start
acting like it.

737
00:33:32,473 --> 00:33:35,140
Yeah. John, we have
a location on Roy.

738
00:33:35,142 --> 00:33:36,975
Let's get ready
to move.

739
00:33:36,977 --> 00:33:39,311
All right. Fine.
Just this once.

740
00:33:39,313 --> 00:33:42,347
No. You don't
trust me,

741
00:33:42,349 --> 00:33:44,449
I don't trust you,

742
00:33:44,451 --> 00:33:46,752
so I'd rather be in the field
short-handed.

743
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,667
Only two guards.

744
00:33:59,669 --> 00:34:01,869
Diaz clearly
wasn't expecting us.

745
00:34:01,871 --> 00:34:03,504
Black Siren
didn't warn him.

746
00:34:03,506 --> 00:34:05,105
- Let's go.
- Wait. If we go in there

747
00:34:05,107 --> 00:34:06,640
without knowing our
primary objective,

748
00:34:06,642 --> 00:34:08,208
no one is coming out.

749
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:09,977
Our primary objective's
to get Roy.

750
00:34:09,979 --> 00:34:11,612
What about Diaz?
He's in there, too,

751
00:34:11,614 --> 00:34:13,547
and we just found out
that he's the one

752
00:34:13,549 --> 00:34:14,949
that's behind everything
bad that's been happening

753
00:34:14,951 --> 00:34:17,084
in the city
for the past 6 months.

754
00:34:17,086 --> 00:34:19,053
So let's get them both.

755
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:23,157
Overwatch,
you in yet?

756
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:25,025
Uplinking...Now.

757
00:34:25,027 --> 00:34:27,061
Huffing and puffing
and blowing all those firewalls down,

758
00:34:27,063 --> 00:34:28,495
but before I finish,
if he's a smart guy--

759
00:34:28,497 --> 00:34:30,130
and we know that he is--

760
00:34:30,132 --> 00:34:32,366
this will definitely tip him
off that you're there.

761
00:34:32,368 --> 00:34:34,134
- We need to know where Roy is.
- Copy that.

762
00:34:34,136 --> 00:34:36,070
I pulled up the blueprints
of the casino from the city.

763
00:34:36,072 --> 00:34:38,539
I'll guide you through.
Head up the escalator.

764
00:34:41,844 --> 00:34:45,913
3 vigilantes, including
your red girlfriend, just showed up.

765
00:34:45,915 --> 00:34:47,615
It's time for a change
of scenery.

766
00:34:47,617 --> 00:34:49,516
You know what to do.

767
00:34:58,527 --> 00:35:01,128
4 hostiles with full autos
right in front of you.

768
00:35:19,048 --> 00:35:21,081
- Which way?
- According to thermals,

769
00:35:21,083 --> 00:35:24,318
Diaz has Roy through the door
on the north wall.

770
00:35:27,556 --> 00:35:31,191
Unit 545 requesting backup.
Shots fired.

771
00:35:31,193 --> 00:35:35,262
Arrows. Make that
arrows fired.

772
00:35:35,264 --> 00:35:36,463
Get away from him!

773
00:35:38,167 --> 00:35:41,135
On the ground! Now!

774
00:35:43,739 --> 00:35:46,807
I love it when you
visit me, Mr. Mayor.

775
00:35:46,809 --> 00:35:50,310
I love it even more
when you leave.

776
00:35:50,312 --> 00:35:53,947
No kill shots.
I need him alive.

777
00:36:01,257 --> 00:36:03,791
Speedy, no!

778
00:36:03,793 --> 00:36:04,858
Unh!

779
00:36:22,845 --> 00:36:24,511
Agh!

780
00:36:47,336 --> 00:36:49,236
We have a problem.
One of Diaz's cops alerted

781
00:36:49,238 --> 00:36:51,038
the legitimate cavalry.

782
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,540
The SCPD is headed
your way en masse.

783
00:37:05,254 --> 00:37:06,854
Agh!

784
00:37:10,793 --> 00:37:13,193
So you're just
a hired hand?

785
00:37:13,195 --> 00:37:16,830
I used to be Pakhan.
You cost me that.

786
00:37:16,832 --> 00:37:18,899
I've got him.
Go help Speedy.

787
00:37:30,412 --> 00:37:32,379
Ergh!

788
00:37:35,918 --> 00:37:37,284
You ok?

789
00:37:39,021 --> 00:37:40,254
Don't move.

790
00:37:40,256 --> 00:37:44,324
Not all those guys are
on my payroll...Yet,

791
00:37:44,326 --> 00:37:46,593
but even the ones
who aren't,

792
00:37:46,595 --> 00:37:49,296
they find
the antivigilante bill

793
00:37:49,298 --> 00:37:51,064
very motivating.

794
00:37:51,066 --> 00:37:55,435
Speedy, get in the van
and drive Roy away.

795
00:37:55,437 --> 00:37:58,472
- What about Diaz?
- I got Diaz.

796
00:37:59,942 --> 00:38:02,476
No, you don't.

797
00:38:02,478 --> 00:38:04,244
You know that, right?

798
00:38:04,246 --> 00:38:08,882
You stay here, you're gonna get
yourself a collar,

799
00:38:08,884 --> 00:38:12,486
and it's not like you could just take me
away with you, right?

800
00:38:12,488 --> 00:38:14,454
But you already knew that.

801
00:38:14,456 --> 00:38:17,424
That's why you let
your sister drive off.

802
00:38:17,426 --> 00:38:19,126
You made your choice.

803
00:38:22,431 --> 00:38:24,431
Freeze!

804
00:38:34,252 --> 00:38:36,789
- How do you feel?
- Ugh. Like I've been beaten

805
00:38:36,791 --> 00:38:38,504
within an inch of my life
with a telephone book.

806
00:38:38,506 --> 00:38:40,406
Two broken ribs,
pulmonary contusion.

807
00:38:40,408 --> 00:38:41,739
You'll have to take it easy
for a few days, Roy.

808
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,807
Well, that's the good part
about being a fugitive.

809
00:38:43,809 --> 00:38:47,277
There's nowhere else
I have to be.

810
00:38:47,279 --> 00:38:48,745
How's Anatoly?

811
00:38:48,747 --> 00:38:53,016
SCPD. I had to bail.
What about Diaz?

812
00:38:53,018 --> 00:38:55,786
Same. How are Quentin
and Dinah doing

813
00:38:55,788 --> 00:38:58,221
with their investigation
into the SCPD?

814
00:38:58,223 --> 00:38:59,756
They're working on it.

815
00:38:59,758 --> 00:39:01,491
I'm not a lawyer,
but what are the effects

816
00:39:01,493 --> 00:39:03,293
of us having the government's
star witness

817
00:39:03,295 --> 00:39:04,761
in our protection
instead of theirs?

818
00:39:04,763 --> 00:39:06,630
- Not as much as you would think.
- Oh.

819
00:39:06,632 --> 00:39:09,666
They'll add witness tampering
and obstruction

820
00:39:09,668 --> 00:39:12,235
to their very long
list of charges.

821
00:39:12,237 --> 00:39:15,172
Hmm. Cherry on top. Heh.

822
00:39:15,174 --> 00:39:17,174
Well, you did it
all for Thea.

823
00:39:19,745 --> 00:39:22,512
And for Roy.

824
00:39:22,514 --> 00:39:24,881
I would have done it
for any of you guys.

825
00:39:36,161 --> 00:39:37,861
My father's asleep.

826
00:39:37,863 --> 00:39:39,596
I came to see you.

827
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,166
Ok.

828
00:39:53,212 --> 00:39:55,212
You didn't set us up.

829
00:39:55,214 --> 00:39:56,847
Gee, Ollie,
you sound surprised.

830
00:39:56,849 --> 00:39:59,182
So I came by to say
thank you.

831
00:39:59,184 --> 00:40:01,385
And yet still
unconvinced.

832
00:40:01,547 --> 00:40:05,382
You're not Laurel,
not our Laurel,

833
00:40:05,384 --> 00:40:09,986
and saying that you are
to a bunch of press, no,

834
00:40:09,988 --> 00:40:12,189
that does not
make it so.

835
00:40:13,225 --> 00:40:14,858
You're right.

836
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:17,694
I'm not,

837
00:40:17,696 --> 00:40:19,196
but I'm willing
to try,

838
00:40:19,198 --> 00:40:21,264
and I can't make
any promises.

839
00:40:21,266 --> 00:40:24,234
I am who I am, but
I'm willing to try

840
00:40:24,236 --> 00:40:27,137
if you're willing
to give me the space to.

841
00:40:27,139 --> 00:40:29,873
That sounds fair.

842
00:40:31,376 --> 00:40:33,143
You're staying here.

843
00:40:33,145 --> 00:40:37,714
Quentin--he--
my father offered me his couch.

844
00:40:37,716 --> 00:40:39,349
He was pretty on
point with the whole

845
00:40:39,351 --> 00:40:41,418
rescue Laurel Lance
story, so...

846
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:43,320
Yeah.

847
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:47,457
I'll be checking in.

848
00:40:47,459 --> 00:40:49,492
Looking forward to it.

849
00:40:58,236 --> 00:41:00,286
_

850
00:41:03,775 --> 00:41:07,277
- Home, sweet home.
- Nice. Heh.

851
00:41:07,279 --> 00:41:10,313
For the past 3 years,
I've been sleeping with the cockroaches.

852
00:41:10,315 --> 00:41:13,316
- Heh.
- Heh.

853
00:41:13,318 --> 00:41:16,586
I--I feel like I should have been
there with you.

854
00:41:16,588 --> 00:41:19,256
Is that too presumptuous
or confusing?

855
00:41:19,258 --> 00:41:21,258
I--I know that last time
we saw each other, I said

856
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,425
that we should probably
see other--

857
00:41:22,427 --> 00:41:24,127
No.

858
00:41:35,741 --> 00:41:40,677
Master, I've located
the heir of Ra's al Ghul.
