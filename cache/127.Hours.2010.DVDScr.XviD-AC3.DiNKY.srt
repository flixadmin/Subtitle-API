1
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,691
<i>Hey, Aron here.</i>

2
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,050
<i>Leave a message.</i>

3
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,330
<i>Hey Aron.</i>

4
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,130
<i>Sonja here... again.</i>

5
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:17,490
<i>I know that you're probably gonna do
ways this week-end,</i>

6
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,529
<i>but listen, just think about
what we're gonna play, please,</i>

7
00:01:20,559 --> 00:01:23,569
<i>'coz we have to decide
and we really need to practice, okay?</i>

8
00:01:23,639 --> 00:01:25,570
<i>Anyway, it'll be fun, I promise.</i>

9
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,008
<i>And, oh! Please call mom,
please 'coz she worries.</i>

10
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:30,649
<i>Which, you know, all right...</i>

11
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:32,969
<i>Later, A. Bye!</i>

12
00:03:20,815 --> 00:03:22,404
It's Friday night!

13
00:03:23,134 --> 00:03:25,885
April 25th, 2003.

14
00:03:26,495 --> 00:03:29,564
I'm just heading to Canyonlands...

15
00:03:29,695 --> 00:03:32,404
Just me, the music...

16
00:03:32,495 --> 00:03:33,884
and the night!

17
00:03:34,694 --> 00:03:35,844
Love it!

18
00:05:01,651 --> 00:05:03,281
Blue John Canyon,

19
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:05,041
guide book says:

20
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:07,721
"One and half hour
to the Big Dropper".

21
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,721
I am to take 45 mins of that.

22
00:07:31,845 --> 00:07:34,115
You're doing Blue John, too, huh?

23
00:07:34,526 --> 00:07:37,115
No. Actually,
we're headed for the Dome.

24
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:38,875
- But I think we're lost.
- She's lost.

25
00:07:39,285 --> 00:07:40,436
Hang on.

26
00:07:41,525 --> 00:07:42,715
Oh, my God!

27
00:07:46,725 --> 00:07:48,115
Let's see this.

28
00:07:49,324 --> 00:07:51,715
You are... here.

29
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,395
We are?

30
00:07:53,605 --> 00:07:55,355
- And...
- I knew that.

31
00:07:56,325 --> 00:07:59,954
And, the Dome, is there.

32
00:08:02,964 --> 00:08:05,474
I can take you that way if you like.

33
00:08:07,804 --> 00:08:10,193
Sorry the...
Friday the 13th there.

34
00:08:10,564 --> 00:08:12,113
Child killer look.

35
00:08:13,564 --> 00:08:17,394
I'm only a psychopath on week days
and today is saturday, so...

36
00:08:19,443 --> 00:08:21,833
Can't take this off... My face.

37
00:08:22,923 --> 00:08:24,074
Nice!

38
00:08:26,084 --> 00:08:27,202
Aron.

39
00:08:27,203 --> 00:08:28,353
Kristi.

40
00:08:28,483 --> 00:08:31,473
Allow me to introduce you
to my friend Megan.

41
00:08:31,723 --> 00:08:34,232
- Nice to meet you.
- It's an honor.

42
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:36,473
What do you say?

43
00:08:36,564 --> 00:08:38,513
You're lost, I'm a guide...

44
00:08:39,442 --> 00:08:40,593
Feel good.

45
00:08:43,043 --> 00:08:44,162
Why not.

46
00:08:44,163 --> 00:08:45,473
- Sure.
- All right.

47
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,232
This way.

48
00:08:48,082 --> 00:08:49,873
So you bike from Horseshoe.

49
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:52,232
Is that like 20 miles?

50
00:08:52,562 --> 00:08:54,473
17 on the odometer.

51
00:08:55,443 --> 00:08:57,232
I thought it was 17.2!

52
00:08:58,242 --> 00:08:59,871
17.3, actually.

53
00:09:00,682 --> 00:09:02,392
Ahh, you're one of those...

54
00:09:02,922 --> 00:09:06,591
- I'm not one of those.
- You spend a lotta time out here?

55
00:09:06,682 --> 00:09:08,392
That's my second home.

56
00:09:09,442 --> 00:09:10,632
See?

57
00:09:11,322 --> 00:09:13,351
There's the fork, right there.

58
00:09:14,201 --> 00:09:15,512
We totally missed that.

59
00:09:16,082 --> 00:09:17,831
Glad we bumped into you.

60
00:09:17,922 --> 00:09:19,981
What are the odds,
considering we're all the way out here?

61
00:09:19,982 --> 00:09:20,940
Exactly.

62
00:09:20,941 --> 00:09:25,311
You go to the one place in America
you guaranteed not to run into a weirdo.

63
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,951
And what happen?!

64
00:09:28,681 --> 00:09:29,751
All right.

65
00:09:30,081 --> 00:09:31,711
So the guide book says

66
00:09:32,561 --> 00:09:34,351
that the route's through here.

67
00:09:35,081 --> 00:09:36,471
But I know a better way.

68
00:09:37,361 --> 00:09:38,591
The cool way.

69
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,110
Guaranteed, best time you can have
with your clothes on.

70
00:09:44,201 --> 00:09:46,349
Although, it's better
with your clothes off.

71
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,229
It is a bit of a climb.

72
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,350
- We climb!
- And a bit of a squeeze.

73
00:09:53,681 --> 00:09:55,070
We squeeze.

74
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,190
So you get us

75
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:02,310
all the way back in here,

76
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,509
and then you tell us
that you're not a guide.

77
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,229
Well no, I'm an engineer.
But this is what I really wanna do.

78
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,349
That's wonderful to hear.

79
00:10:11,439 --> 00:10:13,829
I've always wanted to be a supermodel

80
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:17,069
but I don't think that's actually
gonna workout, you know?

81
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:19,109
Jesus!
What if these things move?

82
00:10:19,199 --> 00:10:22,109
They've been here for millions of years.
They're not gonna move.

83
00:10:22,199 --> 00:10:24,390
- Sure they will!
- What?!

84
00:10:25,318 --> 00:10:28,949
Everything is moving all the time.
Let's just hope not today!

85
00:10:29,479 --> 00:10:30,629
Great.

86
00:10:34,479 --> 00:10:35,629
All right.

87
00:10:36,158 --> 00:10:37,868
Now, all you got to remember...

88
00:10:38,439 --> 00:10:40,588
is that everything will be okay.

89
00:10:40,718 --> 00:10:42,708
Oh, my God!

90
00:10:45,598 --> 00:10:47,588
- Oh, my God!
- Aron?

91
00:10:47,718 --> 00:10:49,228
Are you okay?

92
00:10:49,317 --> 00:10:50,387
Aron?

93
00:11:06,838 --> 00:11:09,867
Listen to the guy, he is fine.

94
00:11:09,957 --> 00:11:11,466
Yeah.

95
00:11:11,557 --> 00:11:12,747
He's bad shit.

96
00:11:12,837 --> 00:11:14,986
You're bad shit!

97
00:11:16,157 --> 00:11:17,227
Come on!

98
00:11:17,317 --> 00:11:18,707
You've got to come down here!

99
00:11:18,917 --> 00:11:20,307
Trust me!

100
00:11:20,357 --> 00:11:23,747
- Trust you? We'll kill you Aron!
- Oh, please.

101
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:25,347
You love this.

102
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:43,786
Nice job!

103
00:11:44,756 --> 00:11:48,226
- Megan, you're missing it!
- Come on, it's amazing!

104
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:51,626
- Oh, fuck, fuck.
- Just jump, Megan.

105
00:11:52,095 --> 00:11:53,286
Oh, fuck!

106
00:12:00,355 --> 00:12:01,505
You okay?

107
00:12:02,115 --> 00:12:04,865
- Nice job!
- I can't believe you did it!

108
00:12:06,234 --> 00:12:09,145
- Okay, we have to do it again!
- Again?

109
00:12:09,635 --> 00:12:11,105
Camera, camera!

110
00:12:28,394 --> 00:12:30,223
So, Blue John,

111
00:12:31,193 --> 00:12:33,744
is actually named after
this guy Blue John...

112
00:12:33,874 --> 00:12:36,263
who was Butch Cassidy's cook.

113
00:12:36,713 --> 00:12:40,264
<i>From Butch Cassidy
and the Sundace Kid.</i>

114
00:12:40,474 --> 00:12:43,863
And they would hide out
in these Canyons, I guess.

115
00:12:44,114 --> 00:12:47,863
But also what they do
is they run wild horses into here

116
00:12:47,953 --> 00:12:50,263
and they trap them
at the end of the Canyon.

117
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:52,743
That's how they caught the horses.

118
00:12:52,874 --> 00:12:55,142
- One more picture before I go?
- Yeah!

119
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:56,272
Okay, cool.

120
00:12:56,273 --> 00:12:57,423
Ready?

121
00:12:58,752 --> 00:13:01,383
One, two, three...

122
00:13:01,474 --> 00:13:05,384
Blue John, blue cheese...
Well, will I ever see you again?

123
00:13:05,472 --> 00:13:07,502
That depends. Do you party?

124
00:13:08,272 --> 00:13:11,143
Do I party? Yeah, sometimes.

125
00:13:11,512 --> 00:13:14,542
Tomorrow night, we're throwing a party
if you wanna come.

126
00:13:14,633 --> 00:13:16,623
You should come by
and have a bear. Kick back.

127
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,022
Okay, where am I going?

128
00:13:18,112 --> 00:13:21,502
It's about 20 miles away,
near Green River behind the old motel.

129
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:25,501
It's behind that. There's gonna be
a huge inflatable Scooby-Doo.

130
00:13:25,592 --> 00:13:26,742
Really? Okay.

131
00:13:26,992 --> 00:13:28,102
- Cool!
- Okay!

132
00:13:28,831 --> 00:13:30,042
It was good to met ya.

133
00:13:30,472 --> 00:13:32,022
- See ya!
- Bye!

134
00:13:32,232 --> 00:13:33,421
Scooby-Doo!

135
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:36,862
Rock on!

136
00:13:40,351 --> 00:13:42,141
You think he's gonna show up?

137
00:13:43,071 --> 00:13:45,901
I don't think
we figured in his day at all.

138
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,861
You liked him!

139
00:17:34,742 --> 00:17:36,132
This is insane!

140
00:18:00,781 --> 00:18:03,612
Move this fucking rock!

141
00:18:16,781 --> 00:18:17,871
Please.

142
00:18:58,499 --> 00:18:59,610
Oh, God.

143
00:19:18,978 --> 00:19:20,927
Kristi!

144
00:19:21,778 --> 00:19:23,168
Megan!

145
00:19:26,018 --> 00:19:27,568
Is there anyone?!

146
00:19:56,177 --> 00:19:57,327
Think.

147
00:20:00,497 --> 00:20:01,647
Just think.

148
00:22:17,051 --> 00:22:18,202
Fuck!

149
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,641
Sssshit!

150
00:22:24,292 --> 00:22:25,361
Shit!

151
00:22:25,971 --> 00:22:27,121
Fucker!

152
00:23:47,048 --> 00:23:48,358
Sweet!

153
00:24:06,807 --> 00:24:07,997
Knife is dull.

154
00:26:29,681 --> 00:26:33,671
Look at the size of this one, man.
How the fuck did this get here?

155
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:38,949
Okay.

156
00:30:40,792 --> 00:30:41,982
Hey, buddy.

157
00:30:42,793 --> 00:30:43,943
Here we go.

158
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:34,020
It's 3:05,

159
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:37,340
on Sunday, April 26th,

160
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:39,660
2003.

161
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:42,459
This marks,

162
00:31:43,229 --> 00:31:45,140
24 hours

163
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:48,940
of being stuck in Blue John Canyon.

164
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:53,220
Right where it slots up
before the Big Drop.

165
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:57,579
My name is Aron Ralston,

166
00:31:57,669 --> 00:32:01,979
my parents are Donna and Larry Ralston
of Englewood, Colorado,

167
00:32:02,829 --> 00:32:03,940
and...

168
00:32:05,269 --> 00:32:08,619
Whoever find this
can keep the recorder.

169
00:32:09,029 --> 00:32:10,179
Just...

170
00:32:10,509 --> 00:32:14,660
Please try and get in touch
with my parents and give them this tape.

171
00:32:15,229 --> 00:32:16,738
I'd appreciate it.

172
00:32:19,269 --> 00:32:22,019
I was descending Blue John,

173
00:32:22,508 --> 00:32:25,019
yesterday, when this...

174
00:32:25,828 --> 00:32:26,979
chockstone...

175
00:32:28,749 --> 00:32:32,138
came loose
and rolled onto my arm...

176
00:32:33,028 --> 00:32:36,138
and now it's stuck and...

177
00:32:36,747 --> 00:32:40,378
my thumb has this kind
of this gray-blue color.

178
00:32:42,667 --> 00:32:46,177
It's been without circulation
for 24 hours.

179
00:32:47,267 --> 00:32:48,417
So...

180
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:51,217
I think it's pretty well gone.

181
00:32:52,747 --> 00:32:54,298
I'm low on food.

182
00:32:57,547 --> 00:33:01,258
That's about... 300-400 ml.

183
00:33:02,386 --> 00:33:04,218
And that's it for water.

184
00:33:09,106 --> 00:33:12,216
I'm in pretty deep doo here.

185
00:33:19,107 --> 00:33:20,177
Please!

186
00:33:20,306 --> 00:33:22,416
There's someone down here!

187
00:33:23,186 --> 00:33:24,576
Help!

188
00:33:24,707 --> 00:33:26,656
I'm in the Canyon!

189
00:34:07,305 --> 00:34:08,454
<i>Help!</i>

190
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:11,814
<i>Help!</i>

191
00:34:12,703 --> 00:34:14,574
<i>Down here!</i>

192
00:34:14,944 --> 00:34:16,535
<i>Help!</i>

193
00:34:30,304 --> 00:34:31,734
Don't loose it.

194
00:34:37,863 --> 00:34:39,014
Aron,

195
00:34:42,383 --> 00:34:44,292
do not loose it.

196
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,811
Not bad.

197
00:35:48,781 --> 00:35:49,931
Dinner.

198
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:03,130
<i>Tomorrow night, we're throwing a party
if you wanna come.</i>

199
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,409
<i>You should come by
and have a bear. Kick back.</i>

200
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,770
<i>There's gonna be
a huge inflatable Scooby-Doo.</i>

201
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,370
Scooby-Doo...

202
00:36:33,299 --> 00:36:34,649
Mountain Dew?

203
00:36:37,618 --> 00:36:39,089
Plastic cup.

204
00:36:41,498 --> 00:36:42,849
Thank you.

205
00:36:46,258 --> 00:36:47,649
Might take a beer as well.

206
00:36:49,978 --> 00:36:51,288
Don't mind if I do?

207
00:37:52,656 --> 00:37:53,766
<i>Aron here.</i>

208
00:37:54,576 --> 00:37:55,965
<i>Leave a message.</i>

209
00:37:59,856 --> 00:38:01,285
<i>Aron, it's mom.</i>

210
00:38:02,176 --> 00:38:03,845
<i>I was hoping to catch you.</i>

211
00:38:05,015 --> 00:38:06,404
<i>Are you there?</i>

212
00:38:06,655 --> 00:38:07,846
<i>Hello?</i>

213
00:38:09,255 --> 00:38:10,365
<i>Okay.</i>

214
00:38:10,656 --> 00:38:12,005
<i>Nothing urgent.</i>

215
00:38:13,616 --> 00:38:16,766
<i>Dad is in New York,
so it'll be a quiet week-end.</i>

216
00:38:17,296 --> 00:38:18,566
<i>Call me, okay?</i>

217
00:38:19,456 --> 00:38:20,526
<i>Lost of love.</i>

218
00:38:39,014 --> 00:38:40,723
Where are you going?

219
00:38:40,814 --> 00:38:42,244
Don't know yet.

220
00:38:42,814 --> 00:38:44,364
Right there, Brian.

221
00:38:44,414 --> 00:38:47,443
Maybe you tell me
and I'll be somewhere else.

222
00:38:47,493 --> 00:38:48,724
Have a good one.

223
00:38:48,814 --> 00:38:49,923
Always do.

224
00:38:50,013 --> 00:38:51,523
<i>Always do.</i>

225
00:39:18,972 --> 00:39:20,323
Let's go.

226
00:41:35,807 --> 00:41:36,956
Crap.

227
00:41:50,486 --> 00:41:53,596
This is freaking me out
looking at myself like that.

228
00:41:53,767 --> 00:41:56,116
Sorry, I hope that's okay.

229
00:42:00,327 --> 00:42:01,557
It's Monday.

230
00:42:04,686 --> 00:42:06,117
Bummer, all day.

231
00:42:07,207 --> 00:42:09,157
I tried to set up this pulley

232
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:11,876
all morning, but it didn't work.

233
00:42:12,646 --> 00:42:14,155
It was worth a try

234
00:42:14,766 --> 00:42:17,636
but there is too much friction
and it's...

235
00:42:18,486 --> 00:42:21,395
a climbing rope,
so there's too much stretch.

236
00:42:22,366 --> 00:42:27,276
What I could really use is
about 20 meters of static rap rope,

237
00:42:27,365 --> 00:42:28,676
9.8 mm.

238
00:42:30,725 --> 00:42:32,076
3 or 4 pulleys,

239
00:42:32,205 --> 00:42:34,555
A rack of carabiners, a sling,

240
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:36,114
power drill,

241
00:42:36,485 --> 00:42:38,154
and a pull kit.

242
00:42:41,485 --> 00:42:44,074
And 8 burly men
to do all the hawling.

243
00:42:46,645 --> 00:42:48,674
That should just about do it.

244
00:42:52,124 --> 00:42:53,274
I have...

245
00:42:56,044 --> 00:42:58,474
150 ml of water left.

246
00:43:00,644 --> 00:43:03,914
What should keep me alive till...

247
00:43:03,964 --> 00:43:05,154
Tomorrow night.

248
00:43:06,325 --> 00:43:07,634
If I'm lucky.

249
00:43:08,284 --> 00:43:09,554
I peed twice.

250
00:43:11,323 --> 00:43:13,593
I almost piss my pants.

251
00:43:16,323 --> 00:43:18,794
My body is actually
acting really weird.

252
00:43:19,843 --> 00:43:20,953
The second time,

253
00:43:22,123 --> 00:43:23,953
I did it in the camelback.

254
00:43:27,843 --> 00:43:29,513
It smells really bad.

255
00:43:30,163 --> 00:43:31,313
But...

256
00:43:31,843 --> 00:43:33,593
I'm sure it'll settle.

257
00:43:36,002 --> 00:43:39,313
It's got to be chilled,
like Sauvignon Blanc.

258
00:43:43,123 --> 00:43:44,313
No number twos.

259
00:43:45,363 --> 00:43:48,393
Which should disappoint
my insect friends.

260
00:43:48,923 --> 00:43:50,913
They'll just have to wait.

261
00:43:51,442 --> 00:43:53,912
Let's, see.
What else could I tell you?

262
00:43:56,961 --> 00:43:58,872
There is this raven

263
00:43:58,962 --> 00:44:00,911
that comes every morning.

264
00:44:05,841 --> 00:44:07,951
I clocked it at 8:17.

265
00:44:10,922 --> 00:44:13,311
I'll film it for you tomorrow.

266
00:44:13,641 --> 00:44:15,072
Every morning at

267
00:44:15,961 --> 00:44:17,071
9:30.

268
00:44:18,321 --> 00:44:20,951
I get fifteen minutes of sunlight.

269
00:44:21,361 --> 00:44:22,631
Really nice.

270
00:44:27,881 --> 00:44:29,431
I've been chipping away.

271
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:31,151
More to...

272
00:44:31,841 --> 00:44:33,431
More to keep warm than anything.

273
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,590
And I'm beginning to think
that my hand is...

274
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,591
supporting the rock.

275
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:44,390
So when I chip away a little bit,
it actually settles more.

276
00:44:49,001 --> 00:44:50,150
So...

277
00:44:52,881 --> 00:44:55,030
I found this great tourniquet.

278
00:45:30,678 --> 00:45:31,749
It hurts.

279
00:46:17,837 --> 00:46:19,866
It hasn't been very useful.

280
00:46:24,396 --> 00:46:25,466
Listen.

281
00:46:25,836 --> 00:46:27,906
Don't buy the cheap

282
00:46:27,997 --> 00:46:30,746
made-in-China multi-tool.

283
00:46:31,355 --> 00:46:34,345
I tried to find
my Swiss Army knife, but...

284
00:46:34,396 --> 00:46:37,305
This thing came free
with a flashlight.

285
00:46:37,356 --> 00:46:40,026
The flashlight
was a piece of shit too.

286
00:46:40,276 --> 00:46:42,866
I kept it in my truck
for emergencies.

287
00:46:44,715 --> 00:46:46,865
Not that I'm blaming you, mom.

288
00:46:47,595 --> 00:46:48,985
It was a...

289
00:46:49,756 --> 00:46:52,986
perfectly great stocking stuffer.

290
00:46:56,155 --> 00:47:00,305
There is no way you could have known
that I'd get in this kind of trouble.

291
00:47:04,476 --> 00:47:07,984
So you have to leave the camera to us
if we want to watch what you've made.

292
00:47:08,034 --> 00:47:10,024
- Yeah.
- Good job, hon.

293
00:47:14,234 --> 00:47:16,985
So he's filming her now.

294
00:47:17,274 --> 00:47:19,504
And we see it there, live.

295
00:47:36,874 --> 00:47:38,864
Well done, okay.

296
00:47:42,953 --> 00:47:44,423
Way to go, sis.

297
00:47:45,393 --> 00:47:48,144
<i>- Keep playing?
- Yes, honey, keep going.</i>

298
00:48:39,671 --> 00:48:40,821
Fuck!

299
00:50:16,627 --> 00:50:17,777
So...

300
00:50:20,067 --> 00:50:21,498
How do I get in?

301
00:50:25,348 --> 00:50:26,657
What's the...

302
00:50:32,227 --> 00:50:33,457
you know...

303
00:50:33,507 --> 00:50:34,577
combination?

304
00:50:37,346 --> 00:50:38,697
If I told you,

305
00:50:41,226 --> 00:50:42,937
I'd have to kill you.

306
00:50:44,347 --> 00:50:46,136
You've already kill me.

307
00:50:59,867 --> 00:51:01,056
Combination?

308
00:51:03,346 --> 00:51:04,935
I think I have it.

309
00:52:09,344 --> 00:52:10,414
Fuck.

310
00:54:04,058 --> 00:54:05,249
Who's there?

311
00:54:13,979 --> 00:54:15,128
Aron?

312
00:54:49,458 --> 00:54:50,608
Please!

313
00:54:51,417 --> 00:54:52,847
Please!

314
00:55:05,336 --> 00:55:07,047
Please!

315
00:55:17,217 --> 00:55:20,525
<i>- Good morning every body...
- It's the morning show...</i>

316
00:55:28,576 --> 00:55:30,366
Good morning everyone!

317
00:55:30,655 --> 00:55:35,685
It is seven o'clock here,
in Canyonlands, U.S.A.

318
00:55:36,095 --> 00:55:38,805
And this morning, on the boulder,

319
00:55:38,896 --> 00:55:41,364
we have a very special guest,

320
00:55:41,536 --> 00:55:45,965
self-proclaimed American super hero...

321
00:55:46,335 --> 00:55:48,924
Aron Ralston!

322
00:55:48,974 --> 00:55:51,205
Let's hear it for Aron!

323
00:55:53,734 --> 00:55:55,364
Hi, oh, gosh, it's...

324
00:55:55,694 --> 00:55:58,205
It's a real pleasure to be here,
thank you.

325
00:55:58,374 --> 00:55:59,524
Thank you.

326
00:56:00,574 --> 00:56:03,484
Hey, can I say "hi"
to my mom and dad?

327
00:56:03,534 --> 00:56:08,004
Mom and dad?
Mustn't forget mom and dad, right Aron?

328
00:56:08,054 --> 00:56:09,644
Yeah, that's right.

329
00:56:10,894 --> 00:56:13,244
Hey mom. I'm really sorry I...

330
00:56:13,934 --> 00:56:16,644
I didn't answered the phone
the other night...

331
00:56:16,773 --> 00:56:20,443
If I had I would have told you
where I was going an then...

332
00:56:21,533 --> 00:56:23,523
I probably
wouldn't be here right now.

333
00:56:23,654 --> 00:56:25,204
That's for sure!

334
00:56:25,333 --> 00:56:27,523
But like I always say:

335
00:56:27,973 --> 00:56:30,802
"Your supreme selfishness...

336
00:56:30,973 --> 00:56:32,923
"is our gain".

337
00:56:32,973 --> 00:56:35,523
Thank you Aron.
Anyone else you'd like to say "hi" to?

338
00:56:37,214 --> 00:56:39,163
- Brian, at work.
- Hi, Aron.

339
00:56:40,853 --> 00:56:43,162
I probably won't be making it
in to work today.

340
00:56:45,252 --> 00:56:47,883
Get a load of this guy!
Oh, wait, hold on.

341
00:56:48,413 --> 00:56:50,522
We've got a question coming in...

342
00:56:50,652 --> 00:56:53,362
from another Aron,

343
00:56:53,973 --> 00:56:57,362
in Loser Canyon, Utah.

344
00:56:57,412 --> 00:56:58,882
Aron asks:

345
00:56:59,093 --> 00:57:01,042
Am I right in thinking...

346
00:57:01,172 --> 00:57:03,962
even if Brian from work...

347
00:57:04,332 --> 00:57:08,362
notifies the police,
they'll put a 24-hour hold on it...

348
00:57:08,412 --> 00:57:11,442
before they file
a missing persons report,

349
00:57:11,652 --> 00:57:15,721
which means
you won't become officially missing...

350
00:57:15,852 --> 00:57:20,041
until midday Wednesday
at the earliest?

351
00:57:20,852 --> 00:57:23,441
Yeah, you're right
on the money there, Aron.

352
00:57:23,491 --> 00:57:28,401
Which means,
I'll probably be dead by then.

353
00:57:28,451 --> 00:57:32,120
Aron, from Loser Canyon, Utah,
how do you know so much?

354
00:57:32,291 --> 00:57:34,881
Well, I'll tell you
how I know so much.

355
00:57:35,730 --> 00:57:37,881
I volunteer
for the rescue service.

356
00:57:38,971 --> 00:57:41,121
You see, I'm some kind of a...

357
00:57:42,770 --> 00:57:45,320
well, a big fucking heart hero.

358
00:57:45,730 --> 00:57:47,000
And I can do

359
00:57:47,690 --> 00:57:50,360
everything on my own, you see?

360
00:57:50,410 --> 00:57:52,719
I do see!

361
00:57:52,890 --> 00:57:53,960
Now...

362
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:56,599
Is it true

363
00:57:57,010 --> 00:57:58,520
that despite,

364
00:57:59,690 --> 00:58:04,320
or maybe because
you're a big fucking heart hero,

365
00:58:04,370 --> 00:58:07,680
you didn't tell anyone
where you were going?

366
00:58:10,210 --> 00:58:11,959
Yeah, that's absolutely correct.

367
00:58:15,649 --> 00:58:16,758
Anyone?

368
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:18,239
Anyone.

369
00:58:20,990 --> 00:58:22,640
Oops...

370
00:58:48,928 --> 00:58:50,718
Mom, dad,

371
00:58:53,687 --> 00:58:56,597
I just wanna take this time
to tell you that

372
00:58:57,088 --> 00:58:59,637
the time we spent together
was awesome.

373
00:59:01,847 --> 00:59:05,197
And I haven't appreciated you
in my heart as I know that I could.

374
00:59:07,886 --> 00:59:09,037
Mom,

375
00:59:09,448 --> 00:59:10,718
I love you.

376
00:59:11,327 --> 00:59:14,598
And I wish that I had returned
all your calls, ever.

377
00:59:19,927 --> 00:59:21,436
I love you, guys.

378
00:59:23,406 --> 00:59:25,476
And I'll always be with you.

379
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:22,230
This is no Slurpee.

380
01:02:25,799 --> 01:02:27,669
It's like a bag of piss.

381
01:03:03,039 --> 01:03:04,868
<i>I'm going again!</i>

382
01:03:08,598 --> 01:03:10,748
<i>With clothes on.</i>

383
01:03:11,398 --> 01:03:15,987
<i>- Megan, tell him.
- We're very worried about you.</i>

384
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:19,947
<i>We're worried
about your musical choices.</i>

385
01:03:19,998 --> 01:03:23,268
<i>If you keep singing Phish
you'll never get a girlfriend.</i>

386
01:03:23,397 --> 01:03:25,628
<i>You might have one,
but I really don't think you do.</i>

387
01:03:25,757 --> 01:03:28,627
<i>- You may be sort of cute.
- Occasions are scarce for you.</i>

388
01:03:28,957 --> 01:03:30,067
<i>Okay.</i>

389
01:03:30,197 --> 01:03:32,146
<i>This canon ball is for you.</i>

390
01:03:42,396 --> 01:03:43,546
<i>I'm going to...</i>

391
01:03:43,956 --> 01:03:47,746
<i>I'm going to test your theory
about whether or not it's better...</i>

392
01:03:49,036 --> 01:03:51,387
<i>to do it without your clothes on.</i>

393
01:04:16,715 --> 01:04:17,865
Don't...

394
01:04:25,036 --> 01:04:26,185
Don't...

395
01:04:29,595 --> 01:04:31,905
<i>Ralston, rock on.</i>

396
01:06:26,910 --> 01:06:29,420
You don't even want me here, do you?

397
01:06:32,190 --> 01:06:34,020
I'm gonna go, Aron.

398
01:06:37,070 --> 01:06:38,860
Is that what you want?

399
01:06:42,389 --> 01:06:43,899
It is, isn't it?

400
01:06:48,309 --> 01:06:49,419
Okay.

401
01:06:51,910 --> 01:06:53,059
Come back.

402
01:06:57,510 --> 01:06:59,819
You're gonna be so lonely, Aron.

403
01:07:16,189 --> 01:07:19,098
<i>46, 47, 48...</i>

404
01:07:19,708 --> 01:07:24,338
<i>49, 50! Aron, I'm coming!</i>

405
01:07:28,148 --> 01:07:29,578
I'm holding on.

406
01:07:31,508 --> 01:07:33,899
Time is moving really slowly.

407
01:07:35,348 --> 01:07:37,857
My heart is beating really fast.

408
01:07:37,907 --> 01:07:39,977
I swear to God, it feels like...

409
01:07:40,627 --> 01:07:44,338
it's beating like three times faster
than it should be.

410
01:07:52,868 --> 01:07:54,657
So cold...

411
01:07:59,866 --> 01:08:01,016
Blue John?

412
01:08:10,226 --> 01:08:11,377
<i>You...</i>

413
01:08:13,866 --> 01:08:14,936
Rana,

414
01:08:15,946 --> 01:08:19,176
<i>- I've been thinking about you girl.
- I've been thinking about you girl.</i>

415
01:08:25,106 --> 01:08:27,416
<i>I know how I am.
I tried to do everything.</i>

416
01:08:27,545 --> 01:08:29,056
<i>How I was...</i>

417
01:08:29,107 --> 01:08:30,296
<i>I tried.</i>

418
01:08:45,945 --> 01:08:48,056
What you guys are doing here?

419
01:08:48,665 --> 01:08:49,715
Eddy?

420
01:08:50,565 --> 01:08:51,655
Tom?

421
01:08:51,865 --> 01:08:54,095
Hey, guys. What's going on?

422
01:08:55,065 --> 01:08:56,214
Eric?

423
01:08:56,684 --> 01:08:57,775
Hey.

424
01:08:59,904 --> 01:09:01,734
You look like the Hole
in the Wall Gang.

425
01:09:05,504 --> 01:09:06,654
Dorks.

426
01:09:09,985 --> 01:09:11,775
Found you, Aron.

427
01:09:19,104 --> 01:09:20,254
Sis,

428
01:09:20,663 --> 01:09:23,093
I'm sorry
that I won't be at your wedding.

429
01:09:23,184 --> 01:09:25,174
I know that I promised to play.

430
01:09:25,504 --> 01:09:26,774
That we play.

431
01:09:27,984 --> 01:09:29,134
I'm sorry.

432
01:09:29,704 --> 01:09:31,733
I know it'll be a good one.

433
01:09:33,743 --> 01:09:35,093
8:15.

434
01:09:35,503 --> 01:09:36,773
there's no raven.

435
01:09:36,903 --> 01:09:38,053
8:20.

436
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:41,053
I didn't tell you
my raven didn't come.

437
01:09:45,943 --> 01:09:47,413
I've been thinking,

438
01:09:47,983 --> 01:09:49,412
everything is...

439
01:09:51,623 --> 01:09:53,093
It just comes together.

440
01:09:53,142 --> 01:09:55,332
<i>You're gonna be so lonely, Aron.</i>

441
01:09:55,743 --> 01:09:56,853
<i>Always do.</i>

442
01:09:56,942 --> 01:09:58,092
Later!

443
01:09:58,182 --> 01:09:59,373
It's me.

444
01:09:59,502 --> 01:10:02,092
<i>Aron, it's mom.
I was hoping to catch you.</i>

445
01:10:02,183 --> 01:10:03,493
I chose this.

446
01:10:03,622 --> 01:10:05,972
<i>Dad's in New-York,
so it'll be a quiet week-end.</i>

447
01:10:06,022 --> 01:10:07,373
I chose all of this.

448
01:10:07,502 --> 01:10:09,972
Call me, okay?
Lots of love!

449
01:10:12,982 --> 01:10:14,131
This rock,

450
01:10:15,702 --> 01:10:18,251
This rock has been waiting for me
my entire life.

451
01:10:18,342 --> 01:10:22,011
I hate this rock!

452
01:10:23,462 --> 01:10:27,450
In it's entire life.
Ever since it was a bit of meteorite.

453
01:10:27,901 --> 01:10:29,932
A million billion years ago.

454
01:10:31,061 --> 01:10:33,851
Up there in space.
It's been waiting...

455
01:10:35,781 --> 01:10:37,331
to come here.

456
01:10:38,221 --> 01:10:40,371
Right, right here.

457
01:10:43,981 --> 01:10:46,050
I've been moving towards it
my hole life.

458
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:47,730
The minute I was born...

459
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:49,450
every breath I've taken...

460
01:10:49,821 --> 01:10:51,091
every action...

461
01:10:51,140 --> 01:10:53,931
has been leading me to this...

462
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:56,250
crack on the out surface.

463
01:15:11,771 --> 01:15:13,121
Come on.

464
01:15:48,289 --> 01:15:50,239
Don't pass out.

465
01:18:50,962 --> 01:18:52,112
Thank you.

466
01:21:00,958 --> 01:21:02,106
Easy.

467
01:24:35,989 --> 01:24:37,299
Help!

468
01:24:41,308 --> 01:24:42,499
Please!

469
01:24:43,348 --> 01:24:44,818
Help me!

470
01:24:50,828 --> 01:24:52,738
I need help!

471
01:25:05,028 --> 01:25:06,538
I need agua...

472
01:25:06,828 --> 01:25:09,578
I'm Aron Ralston.
Since Saturday I was trapped...

473
01:25:09,747 --> 01:25:12,338
by a boulder.

474
01:25:12,428 --> 01:25:14,097
No water for 5 days.

475
01:25:15,587 --> 01:25:17,258
I cut my arm off.

476
01:25:19,987 --> 01:25:22,416
Please, some water.

477
01:25:24,667 --> 01:25:25,977
Thank you.

478
01:25:35,426 --> 01:25:38,817
- You've got a phone?
- Yes, but no signal.

479
01:25:38,906 --> 01:25:40,737
You should stop and rest.

480
01:25:41,586 --> 01:25:43,897
No, I better keep going.

481
01:25:44,907 --> 01:25:46,256
Can one of you run?

482
01:25:46,827 --> 01:25:48,376
Can one of you run ahead?

483
01:27:59,721 --> 01:28:02,871
Arons premonition
came true.

484
01:28:04,022 --> 01:28:07,290
He met his wife Jessica
three years later.

485
01:28:09,541 --> 01:28:13,591
Their son, Leo,
was born in February 2010.

486
01:28:17,221 --> 01:28:21,409
Aron continues to be a climber
and Canyoneer.

487
01:28:28,780 --> 01:28:34,049
He always leaves a note
to say where he has gone.
