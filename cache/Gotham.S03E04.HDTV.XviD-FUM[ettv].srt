1
00:00:00,985 --> 00:00:02,868
- Previously on Gotham...
- Listen to the watch.

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:06,597
It's ticking. Synchronizes
with your heartbeat.

3
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:08,646
Stand upon the back of the chair.

4
00:00:08,681 --> 00:00:10,998
So you could get him to
do anything you wanted?

5
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,167
I want you to find my sister.

6
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:16,504
Her condition, some poison in her blood.

7
00:00:16,506 --> 00:00:18,639
I announce my candidacy for mayor.

8
00:00:20,176 --> 00:00:22,143
Hugo Strange made another you.

9
00:00:22,178 --> 00:00:23,227
- He's gone.
- He cut his hair.

10
00:00:23,262 --> 00:00:24,729
To look more like you.

11
00:00:24,764 --> 00:00:26,297
Does Alfred know you have his car?

12
00:00:26,332 --> 00:00:28,265
Would you like to go for a ride?

13
00:00:29,485 --> 00:00:31,435
The ticking synchronizes
with your heartbeat.

14
00:00:31,471 --> 00:00:34,071
Deep down, you want to die, Jim.

15
00:00:34,107 --> 00:00:35,189
Step off the ledge.

16
00:00:35,191 --> 00:00:36,574
Stop!

17
00:00:42,665 --> 00:00:44,615
You don't understand.

18
00:00:44,667 --> 00:00:48,536
My-my brother will find out I'm
here, and he'll come for me.

19
00:00:48,538 --> 00:00:50,037
Nothing will stop him.

20
00:00:50,072 --> 00:00:51,956
This is the brother
that took you to Strange

21
00:00:52,008 --> 00:00:53,124
to try and fix you?

22
00:00:53,176 --> 00:00:54,675
What? No.

23
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,294
Jervis kept me a
prisoner most of my life,

24
00:00:57,346 --> 00:00:59,680
and when I finally managed to escape,

25
00:00:59,715 --> 00:01:01,849
I ran as far away from him as I could.

26
00:01:01,884 --> 00:01:03,217
Mm-hmm, and landed in Gotham.

27
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:06,220
It seemed like a good place to hide.

28
00:01:06,222 --> 00:01:09,523
Until Strange found me and
locked me in Indian Hill.

29
00:01:09,559 --> 00:01:12,943
I'll admit, not the best luck
for you or your future landlord.

30
00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:14,812
That was an accident.

31
00:01:14,864 --> 00:01:17,398
The infecting part or the
lighting him on fire part?

32
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,366
I'm not a monster!

33
00:01:19,402 --> 00:01:21,819
But if you want to see one,

34
00:01:21,871 --> 00:01:24,889
just wait until my brother comes for me.

35
00:01:26,442 --> 00:01:28,442
You don't know what he's capable of.

36
00:01:29,962 --> 00:01:32,379
This isn't over.

37
00:01:34,217 --> 00:01:36,784
For either of us.

38
00:01:41,257 --> 00:01:43,591
It's perfect!

39
00:01:43,593 --> 00:01:45,759
Oh, my sister used to
love amusement parks.

40
00:01:45,761 --> 00:01:49,396
The rides, the food, the
tents with amazing acts.

41
00:01:49,432 --> 00:01:51,816
That's why I became a performer.

42
00:01:51,851 --> 00:01:54,168
Are you a family man?

43
00:01:54,203 --> 00:01:55,686
Yes.

44
00:01:55,738 --> 00:01:57,354
I am a family man.

45
00:01:59,809 --> 00:02:03,861
The day I lost her was
the saddest of my life.

46
00:02:03,913 --> 00:02:06,747
The only thing that got me through,

47
00:02:06,782 --> 00:02:09,366
that kept me sane,

48
00:02:09,418 --> 00:02:12,586
was the hope of one day
being together again.

49
00:02:14,624 --> 00:02:16,240
Reunited.

50
00:02:16,275 --> 00:02:18,692
And if all goes well,

51
00:02:18,728 --> 00:02:22,379
that day is today.

52
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:30,855
Of course, a reunion like this

53
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,591
needs to be a private affair.

54
00:02:33,626 --> 00:02:35,476
You understand.

56
00:02:43,486 --> 00:02:46,654
It's Election Day in Gotham,
with former mayor Aubrey James

57
00:02:46,706 --> 00:02:49,874
and former criminal
kingpin Oswald Cobblepot

58
00:02:49,909 --> 00:02:51,208
running toe to toe...

59
00:02:51,244 --> 00:02:52,710
Why don't you take care of it.

60
00:02:52,745 --> 00:02:54,211
Appreciate it.

61
00:02:54,247 --> 00:02:55,329
Thank you.

62
00:02:58,501 --> 00:03:00,417
I must say, you are looking

63
00:03:00,453 --> 00:03:02,136
quite the dapper fellow.

64
00:03:03,339 --> 00:03:05,506
I had to guess on the jacket size.

65
00:03:05,558 --> 00:03:08,776
- I hope it fits.
- Perfectly.

66
00:03:08,811 --> 00:03:10,261
I cannot thank you enough.

67
00:03:10,313 --> 00:03:11,629
It's just a suit.

68
00:03:11,664 --> 00:03:13,480
No. No, if it weren't for you,

69
00:03:13,516 --> 00:03:16,967
I would still be falling asleep
to the screams of the insane.

70
00:03:17,003 --> 00:03:19,486
It becomes almost a white noise
after a while, doesn't it?

71
00:03:19,522 --> 00:03:20,905
It does.

72
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,274
I do believe, Oswald,

73
00:03:23,326 --> 00:03:27,044
Arkham has made us both stronger.

74
00:03:28,864 --> 00:03:30,531
I couldn't agree more.

75
00:03:30,533 --> 00:03:33,834
Which is why I had

76
00:03:33,869 --> 00:03:35,202
our release certificates framed.

77
00:03:35,204 --> 00:03:38,038
A reminder of past struggles

78
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,374
and new beginnings.

79
00:03:40,376 --> 00:03:41,842
If I didn't know better,

80
00:03:41,877 --> 00:03:43,677
I'd accuse you of
being a sentimentalist.

81
00:03:43,713 --> 00:03:45,212
Guilty.

82
00:03:46,515 --> 00:03:48,716
You all set, boss? Busy day today.

83
00:03:48,718 --> 00:03:50,351
Who were those people
you were speaking with?

84
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,637
Don't worry about it.

85
00:03:53,689 --> 00:03:55,272
Come now, Butch. Play nice.

86
00:03:55,308 --> 00:03:57,355
We're all on the same team here.

87
00:03:57,393 --> 00:03:59,059
Right?

88
00:03:59,061 --> 00:04:01,028
My team.

89
00:04:01,063 --> 00:04:02,563
Yeah. Sure.

90
00:04:02,565 --> 00:04:03,731
Whatever you say.

91
00:04:05,804 --> 00:04:08,202
You keep your nose out of my business.

92
00:04:08,237 --> 00:04:09,570
Yeah.

93
00:04:09,572 --> 00:04:10,654
Sure.

94
00:04:12,008 --> 00:04:13,874
Whatever you say.

95
00:04:21,667 --> 00:04:24,001
Why is it that every time

96
00:04:24,053 --> 00:04:25,419
something hits the fan around here,

97
00:04:25,421 --> 00:04:27,721
I inevitably find you
at the center of it?

98
00:04:27,757 --> 00:04:29,039
I was just working a job.

99
00:04:29,075 --> 00:04:30,557
Her brother asked me to find her.

100
00:04:30,593 --> 00:04:32,843
Yeah. You're some sort
of P.I. now? Is that it?

101
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,928
I'm whatever pays the bills. Great.

102
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,081
What do we know about this girl's blood?

103
00:04:37,116 --> 00:04:39,817
Not much. She claims infecting
the landlord was an accident.

104
00:04:39,852 --> 00:04:41,518
Have Thompkins draw some samples,

105
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:43,604
see if she can find out what
we're dealing with here.

106
00:04:43,606 --> 00:04:44,989
And pick up the brother for questioning.

107
00:04:45,024 --> 00:04:47,691
Any idea where we might find him?

108
00:04:47,727 --> 00:04:49,943
No. But when I do, I'll let you know.

109
00:04:49,945 --> 00:04:51,362
We have some unfinished business.

110
00:04:51,397 --> 00:04:52,329
Not anymore.

111
00:04:52,365 --> 00:04:53,947
This is an active investigation.

112
00:04:53,983 --> 00:04:56,250
You go anywhere near him,
I'll have you arrested.

113
00:04:56,285 --> 00:04:58,118
For what?

114
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,121
No law against two private
citizens having a chat.

115
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:05,738
I'll come by later to pick up my check.

116
00:05:09,369 --> 00:05:12,249
I bet I'd make a kick-ass P.I.

117
00:05:12,284 --> 00:05:14,101
Get out.

118
00:05:24,563 --> 00:05:26,647
Have you had this condition since birth?

119
00:05:28,484 --> 00:05:29,888
Tell me about it.

120
00:05:30,974 --> 00:05:32,820
If a person comes into
contact with my blood,

121
00:05:32,822 --> 00:05:34,271
it changes them.

122
00:05:35,574 --> 00:05:37,694
It affects every person differently.

123
00:05:38,052 --> 00:05:42,596
My brother believes it brings
out a person's true nature.

124
00:05:42,631 --> 00:05:45,766
Is your brother infected?

125
00:05:45,801 --> 00:05:48,435
Is that why you're so terrified of him?

126
00:05:48,471 --> 00:05:50,471
Jervis isn't infected.

127
00:05:50,506 --> 00:05:53,757
He believes we're connected.

128
00:05:54,543 --> 00:05:56,560
Two sides of the same coin.

129
00:05:57,424 --> 00:06:01,014
My way is the blood, and his, the mind.

130
00:06:01,016 --> 00:06:03,033
Hypnosis.

131
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,603
It goes way beyond that.

132
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,656
He preys on fear,

133
00:06:09,692 --> 00:06:11,992
anger, regret.

134
00:06:12,027 --> 00:06:15,012
And if he gets in your mind...

135
00:06:17,032 --> 00:06:19,149
you're doomed.

136
00:06:21,704 --> 00:06:24,421
Vote for Oswald Cobblepot,

137
00:06:24,457 --> 00:06:26,290
your next mayor of Gotham!
Vote for Cobblepot.

138
00:06:26,342 --> 00:06:28,709
Here you go. Cobblepot for mayor.

139
00:06:28,711 --> 00:06:32,463
And Make Gotham Safe Again!

140
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:38,719
Vote for Oswald Cobblepot,
your next mayor of Gotham!

141
00:06:40,272 --> 00:06:44,224
You are so very tired
of life, aren't you?

142
00:06:44,276 --> 00:06:46,810
Do you hear my watch ticking?

143
00:06:52,568 --> 00:06:56,236
Hard road for you, Jim Gordon.

144
00:06:56,238 --> 00:06:57,704
Listen closer.

145
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:04,995
You are so very tired
of life, aren't you?

146
00:07:05,047 --> 00:07:07,047
Now you can rest, Jim.

147
00:07:20,646 --> 00:07:21,929
Hey, pal!

148
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,766
You got a death wish or something?

149
00:07:32,848 --> 00:07:35,232
Right, yes. Well, will
do. Thank you very much.

150
00:07:35,267 --> 00:07:36,433
Good-bye.

151
00:07:38,187 --> 00:07:40,103
Well, that was the impound
yard from downtown.

152
00:07:40,105 --> 00:07:41,504
It appears the Rolls

153
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,573
was towed only this
morning, Master Bruce.

154
00:07:43,609 --> 00:07:45,775
This doesn't make any sense.

155
00:07:45,827 --> 00:07:48,445
- Why would he leave?
- Well, he cut his hair

156
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,364
to look more like you,
if that's even possible.

157
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:52,782
You think he went to the
city to pretend to be me.

158
00:07:52,834 --> 00:07:55,986
- Yeah, absolutely. Bloody yes.
- So where would he go?

159
00:07:56,021 --> 00:07:58,455
Take in a show, do a little
bit of shopping, have a facial?

160
00:07:58,457 --> 00:08:00,957
I mean, where do pain-resistant clones

161
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:03,076
of multibillionaire
teenagers normally go?

162
00:08:03,111 --> 00:08:05,028
- Alfred.
- Well, I don't know.

163
00:08:05,063 --> 00:08:07,464
The car was found at 11th
and Dillon, wasn't it?

164
00:08:07,499 --> 00:08:08,932
That's in the Narrows.

165
00:08:08,967 --> 00:08:12,371
So I suppose we should be thankful
there's anything left to tow.

166
00:08:16,108 --> 00:08:19,142
What in the dickens was he doing
down there in the first place?

167
00:08:20,195 --> 00:08:22,279
Selina.

168
00:08:25,345 --> 00:08:27,817
11th and Dillon is near her apartment.

169
00:08:27,869 --> 00:08:29,319
Sorry, again, for the way I acted

170
00:08:29,371 --> 00:08:30,954
when you came by yesterday.

171
00:08:30,989 --> 00:08:32,372
Any word on your friend Ivy?

172
00:08:32,407 --> 00:08:34,074
No.

173
00:08:34,126 --> 00:08:36,042
I even braved a beat-down
from Sonny to see

174
00:08:36,078 --> 00:08:38,871
if she was growing magic
mushrooms for him again.

175
00:08:38,896 --> 00:08:41,464
- Magic what?
- Mushrooms.

176
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,500
Sonny Gilzean.

177
00:08:43,502 --> 00:08:46,136
Pounded you to within
an inch of your life.

178
00:08:46,171 --> 00:08:48,338
Yeah. Sonny, right.

179
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,307
Well, this is it.

180
00:08:50,342 --> 00:08:52,592
Time to earn a living.

181
00:08:52,644 --> 00:08:54,177
- You work here?
- No.

182
00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:55,679
I rob here.

183
00:08:55,681 --> 00:08:56,980
What?

184
00:08:57,015 --> 00:08:58,815
The Bang Bang Room is a betting parlor.

185
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:00,600
Should be flush today
with the mayor's race.

186
00:09:00,652 --> 00:09:03,186
Meet me around back in five minutes.

187
00:09:05,322 --> 00:09:06,461
Selina.

188
00:09:07,526 --> 00:09:09,826
Yeah! Pay up!

189
00:09:19,456 --> 00:09:21,623
Hey, that guy at the end of the bar

190
00:09:21,675 --> 00:09:23,341
said you're buying the place a round.

191
00:09:23,376 --> 00:09:24,209
What?

192
00:09:24,211 --> 00:09:26,878
Mm-hmm. Oh, and your mom sucks.

193
00:09:27,714 --> 00:09:29,130
Or something.

194
00:09:29,182 --> 00:09:30,882
Really?

195
00:09:36,223 --> 00:09:37,722
Hey, wise guy!

196
00:09:37,724 --> 00:09:39,140
Here's your drink!

197
00:09:44,564 --> 00:09:46,064
Get him off me! That's enough!

198
00:10:01,915 --> 00:10:03,414
Who the hell are you?

199
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,333
Sorry.

200
00:10:05,385 --> 00:10:06,501
My first day.

201
00:10:06,553 --> 00:10:07,752
Uh...

202
00:10:07,754 --> 00:10:09,470
can you help me find the cherries?

203
00:10:09,506 --> 00:10:10,922
No?

204
00:10:10,924 --> 00:10:13,141
Probably behind the bar. Right.

205
00:10:13,176 --> 00:10:14,259
Uh, I'll go check.

206
00:10:14,261 --> 00:10:16,010
Hey, Squirrel,

207
00:10:16,062 --> 00:10:18,246
what's the odds of a
person getting out of here

208
00:10:18,281 --> 00:10:19,581
in one piece?

209
00:10:19,616 --> 00:10:21,099
Not good, boss.

210
00:10:25,522 --> 00:10:29,157
My beloved mother

211
00:10:29,192 --> 00:10:31,492
always believed in me.

212
00:10:31,528 --> 00:10:36,130
Even when I doubted
myself, she held firm.

213
00:10:38,806 --> 00:10:41,586
Seeing all of your bright
faces reminds me that

214
00:10:41,621 --> 00:10:46,541
there is nothing you cannot
do if you put your mind to it.

215
00:10:46,593 --> 00:10:51,379
And when I am mayor, I believe...

216
00:10:51,431 --> 00:10:56,134
no... I know that together,

217
00:10:56,186 --> 00:10:59,053
we will Make Gotham Safe Again!

218
00:11:06,446 --> 00:11:07,896
Excuse me.

219
00:11:08,782 --> 00:11:10,448
Are you on the election board?

220
00:11:10,483 --> 00:11:11,983
Yeah.

221
00:11:11,985 --> 00:11:13,368
I work for Mr. Cobblepot.

222
00:11:13,403 --> 00:11:15,820
He just wanted me to confirm
what Butch gave you. May I?

223
00:11:15,822 --> 00:11:17,322
Thank you.

224
00:11:21,912 --> 00:11:23,161
It's all there.

225
00:11:23,163 --> 00:11:24,162
Thank you.

226
00:11:26,672 --> 00:11:29,417
Follow him for the rest of the day.

227
00:11:29,469 --> 00:11:31,586
Don't let him leave your sight.

228
00:11:38,561 --> 00:11:41,729
Well, look who's back.

229
00:11:43,767 --> 00:11:45,566
I saw you last night.

230
00:11:45,602 --> 00:11:47,685
You didn't even say hi. Rude.

231
00:11:47,737 --> 00:11:50,388
- I need to find Jervis Tetch.
- Oh, you mean

232
00:11:50,423 --> 00:11:53,441
"The Great Jervis Tetch,
Hypnotist Extraordinaire"?

233
00:11:53,493 --> 00:11:56,661
You believe it actually says
that on his business card?

234
00:11:56,696 --> 00:11:58,446
Number's been disconnected. Where is he?

235
00:11:58,498 --> 00:11:59,864
I don't know.

236
00:11:59,866 --> 00:12:01,532
Magic shop, bunny farm...

237
00:12:01,584 --> 00:12:04,502
Someplace where everyone
wears top hats and drinks tea?

238
00:12:04,537 --> 00:12:06,120
Barbara.

239
00:12:06,172 --> 00:12:08,373
You know, I'm not sure
I like this new thing

240
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,842
of you storming in here every time

241
00:12:10,877 --> 00:12:11,876
you need something.

242
00:12:11,928 --> 00:12:13,711
It's almost like we're married.

243
00:12:13,713 --> 00:12:14,712
Scary thought.

244
00:12:18,885 --> 00:12:21,052
I need a favor.

245
00:12:21,104 --> 00:12:23,304
Oh...

246
00:12:23,356 --> 00:12:27,475
Then you must be monumentally screwed.

247
00:12:27,527 --> 00:12:31,312
What happened? Did he hypnotize you?

248
00:12:31,364 --> 00:12:33,564
Make you bark like a dog?

249
00:12:33,616 --> 00:12:35,900
He's dangerous, Barbara.

250
00:12:35,952 --> 00:12:38,403
Don't say I didn't warn you.

251
00:12:39,656 --> 00:12:41,155
Okay.

252
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:45,994
He came in here earlier.

253
00:12:46,046 --> 00:12:48,046
Said he wanted to hire some muscle.

254
00:12:48,081 --> 00:12:49,881
- Muscle?
- Yeah.

255
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:50,999
For some performance he's planning.

256
00:12:51,051 --> 00:12:52,867
Said he needed them to have flair.

257
00:12:52,902 --> 00:12:54,085
What'd you tell him?

258
00:12:54,087 --> 00:12:56,170
It's Gotham, baby.

259
00:12:56,222 --> 00:12:59,390
We've all got flair.

260
00:12:59,426 --> 00:13:01,592
Thanks.

261
00:13:01,594 --> 00:13:04,262
Always a help.

262
00:13:04,264 --> 00:13:05,763
Ugh!

263
00:13:25,168 --> 00:13:26,951
Excellent!

264
00:13:29,422 --> 00:13:32,623
Deever and Dumfree, I presume.

265
00:13:32,675 --> 00:13:34,292
The Terrible Tweeds.

266
00:13:34,344 --> 00:13:37,128
Your reputation precedes you.

267
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,963
And you are?

268
00:13:38,965 --> 00:13:40,798
Jervis Tetch.

269
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,602
I have a job that might
suit your particular skills.

270
00:13:44,637 --> 00:13:47,472
My sister's been taken by the GCPD.

271
00:13:47,524 --> 00:13:50,058
I need to get her back.

272
00:13:51,811 --> 00:13:55,313
You want to break
someone out of the GCPD?

273
00:13:55,365 --> 00:13:56,914
Not "someone."

274
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:58,900
My sister.

275
00:13:58,935 --> 00:14:02,620
I assumed men like yourselves
understood the bond

276
00:14:02,655 --> 00:14:04,122
of family.

277
00:14:06,359 --> 00:14:08,159
What's in it for us?

278
00:14:08,161 --> 00:14:10,578
Does he... ever speak?

279
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:14,999
Regardless, if you'll do the courtesy

280
00:14:15,034 --> 00:14:18,669
of listening to me, I think you'll find

281
00:14:18,671 --> 00:14:21,005
I can be quite persuasive.

282
00:14:32,136 --> 00:14:34,803
Place is packed to the gills.

283
00:14:34,838 --> 00:14:37,656
It's running two to one, for Penguin.

284
00:14:37,691 --> 00:14:39,758
Mm. Sounds like you're busy.

285
00:14:40,319 --> 00:14:41,902
Maybe I should go, huh?

286
00:14:41,937 --> 00:14:43,570
No. This won't take long.

287
00:14:43,622 --> 00:14:45,405
I hate people with sticky fingers.

288
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,411
Okay, wait.

289
00:14:47,424 --> 00:14:48,840
W-What do you... what do you need?

290
00:14:48,892 --> 00:14:51,843
Huh? Money? Information?

291
00:14:51,895 --> 00:14:53,594
I could be useful.

292
00:14:53,646 --> 00:14:55,897
Oh, you will be.

293
00:14:55,932 --> 00:14:57,432
You'll send a message.

294
00:14:59,069 --> 00:15:00,518
But maybe...

295
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,820
I don't got to do this.

296
00:15:02,856 --> 00:15:04,455
I mean, maybe...

297
00:15:04,491 --> 00:15:06,524
you learned your lesson.

298
00:15:06,576 --> 00:15:07,992
Yeah, totally. I...

299
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,496
You're screwing with me, aren't you?

300
00:15:11,531 --> 00:15:12,613
Yeah.

301
00:15:12,615 --> 00:15:14,198
Do it.

302
00:15:27,597 --> 00:15:28,679
Bruce?

303
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:58,493
Let's go.

304
00:16:01,831 --> 00:16:03,748
And although some have
criticized Mr. Cobblepot

305
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,584
for running a campaign based
largely on name-calling

306
00:16:06,586 --> 00:16:07,919
and fear-mongering...

307
00:16:07,971 --> 00:16:09,888
His simple message of

308
00:16:09,923 --> 00:16:11,890
"Make Gotham Safe Again" has...

309
00:16:11,925 --> 00:16:14,425
Can you believe Penguin
might win this thing?

310
00:16:14,427 --> 00:16:16,094
Whole city's going to hell

311
00:16:16,146 --> 00:16:17,262
in a handbasket.

312
00:16:18,815 --> 00:16:20,565
You okay?

313
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,350
Fine.

314
00:16:22,402 --> 00:16:23,735
I assume

315
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:25,904
you didn't come here
to ask about my health.

316
00:16:27,284 --> 00:16:29,440
I need to speak with Alice Tetch.

317
00:16:29,442 --> 00:16:30,858
No.

318
00:16:30,911 --> 00:16:32,310
Five minutes, that's all I'm asking.

319
00:16:32,345 --> 00:16:34,212
She's scheduled to be moved
to a facility upstate.

320
00:16:34,247 --> 00:16:35,613
I'm sure she'll have
plenty of time then.

321
00:16:35,615 --> 00:16:36,998
This can't wait.

322
00:16:37,761 --> 00:16:39,217
What's going on?

323
00:16:43,006 --> 00:16:44,706
You can talk to me, son.

324
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,392
Her brother.

325
00:16:47,427 --> 00:16:49,460
I had a run-in with him last night.

326
00:16:49,512 --> 00:16:52,380
Think he may have done something to me.

327
00:16:52,432 --> 00:16:53,881
Like what?

328
00:16:53,934 --> 00:16:55,300
I don't know.

329
00:16:57,604 --> 00:16:59,587
I'm having thoughts.

330
00:17:01,691 --> 00:17:04,058
Look...

331
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,660
you've caught some bad breaks.

332
00:17:05,695 --> 00:17:07,829
Blackgate. Lee.

333
00:17:07,864 --> 00:17:09,781
I don't know what happened
when you went to see her,

334
00:17:09,816 --> 00:17:11,316
but I can take a pretty good guess.

335
00:17:13,253 --> 00:17:15,436
But at some point, you're
gonna have to make peace

336
00:17:15,472 --> 00:17:17,755
with the decisions you've made.

337
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:19,924
And what if I can't?

338
00:17:21,945 --> 00:17:24,128
Take it from me,

339
00:17:24,164 --> 00:17:26,381
you don't want to wake
up one day and realize

340
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:29,083
that 20 years has gone by.

341
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:34,339
We're keeping Alice in interrogation.

342
00:17:34,391 --> 00:17:36,341
Five minutes.

343
00:17:43,566 --> 00:17:45,683
What was that back there?

344
00:17:45,735 --> 00:17:47,769
- What?
- You.

345
00:17:47,821 --> 00:17:51,689
Remind me to give props
to Alfred on his training.

346
00:17:51,691 --> 00:17:54,242
I did not think you had that in you.

347
00:17:54,277 --> 00:17:56,327
Me neither.

348
00:17:56,363 --> 00:17:57,612
You okay?

349
00:17:57,664 --> 00:17:59,113
You?

350
00:17:59,165 --> 00:18:01,199
A little lightheaded.

351
00:18:02,552 --> 00:18:03,753
Bruce.

352
00:18:04,929 --> 00:18:07,538
- Oh... You need a hospital.
- No.

353
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,123
No hospitals.

354
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:13,878
- Are those scars?
- Nothing, they're nothing.

355
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,630
You're not Bruce.

356
00:18:15,682 --> 00:18:17,215
Selina, just...

357
00:18:17,217 --> 00:18:19,133
- You're not Bruce.
- Just-just listen...

358
00:18:19,185 --> 00:18:21,719
- What the hell are you?!
- I won't hurt you. Just let me...

359
00:18:21,771 --> 00:18:23,938
Just let me explain.

360
00:18:26,776 --> 00:18:30,561
I assume you know Butch is
paying campaign officials

361
00:18:30,563 --> 00:18:31,562
to buy the election?

362
00:18:31,564 --> 00:18:33,064
You don't approve?

363
00:18:34,067 --> 00:18:35,700
My dear Ed, this is Gotham.

364
00:18:35,735 --> 00:18:37,118
This is how things are done.

365
00:18:37,153 --> 00:18:38,953
And in theory, I support that.

366
00:18:38,988 --> 00:18:40,405
But, Oswald,

367
00:18:40,457 --> 00:18:43,291
Do you see how these people
are cheering for you?

368
00:18:43,326 --> 00:18:46,411
Yes, they... do seem very excited.

369
00:18:46,463 --> 00:18:48,746
You can win this on your own.

370
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:51,499
Why risk it? There is no upside.

371
00:18:51,551 --> 00:18:53,835
I want this, Ed. I want this
like I've never wanted anything.

372
00:18:53,887 --> 00:18:55,086
I know.

373
00:18:55,088 --> 00:18:58,339
Which is why you need to call off Butch.

374
00:19:02,178 --> 00:19:03,678
Mr. Penguin?

375
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:05,146
Hello, there.

376
00:19:05,181 --> 00:19:08,483
I wanted to thank you for
getting rid of all the monsters.

377
00:19:12,655 --> 00:19:14,572
Do you see?

378
00:19:14,607 --> 00:19:16,607
People look at me differently now.

379
00:19:16,609 --> 00:19:18,943
For the first time in my life,

380
00:19:18,945 --> 00:19:20,328
I feel wanted.

381
00:19:20,363 --> 00:19:22,029
Nice doing business with you.

382
00:19:28,621 --> 00:19:31,038
And how do you feel now?

383
00:19:31,091 --> 00:19:32,507
I feel like I've misjudged someone

384
00:19:32,542 --> 00:19:34,008
who was supposed to be my friend.

385
00:19:34,043 --> 00:19:35,460
I am your friend.

386
00:19:35,512 --> 00:19:38,546
I can't be bought, but I
can be stolen with a glance.

387
00:19:38,598 --> 00:19:40,515
I'm worthless to one,
but priceless to two.

388
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,300
- What am I?
- I don't care.

389
00:19:42,352 --> 00:19:44,802
I do not need a stupid riddle right now.

390
00:19:44,854 --> 00:19:47,305
I know what I want.

391
00:19:47,307 --> 00:19:49,640
I want to be mayor.

392
00:19:49,692 --> 00:19:51,442
Stay out of it, Ed.

393
00:19:51,478 --> 00:19:53,478
I'm warning you.

394
00:19:58,318 --> 00:20:00,151
I need to find your brother.

395
00:20:01,955 --> 00:20:04,238
You turn me in, and
now you want my help.

396
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:07,408
I was hoping we could help each other.

397
00:20:08,711 --> 00:20:11,329
He's still in your head, isn't he?

398
00:20:17,777 --> 00:20:19,887
How do I stop it?

399
00:20:19,923 --> 00:20:20,988
I don't know.

400
00:20:21,024 --> 00:20:22,223
Most of the time,

401
00:20:22,258 --> 00:20:24,509
once the trance is broken, that's it.

402
00:20:24,511 --> 00:20:25,560
You should've been fine

403
00:20:25,595 --> 00:20:26,677
the moment you stepped off the ledge.

404
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:28,179
Then why is it still happening?

405
00:20:28,181 --> 00:20:31,682
Jervis has tapped into something
you're struggling with.

406
00:20:31,734 --> 00:20:34,101
Something a part of
you would do anything

407
00:20:34,154 --> 00:20:35,736
not to face.

408
00:20:35,772 --> 00:20:38,189
Then give me something to
fight this until I find him.

409
00:20:38,191 --> 00:20:41,542
There's usually a trigger that
brings on the hypnotic state.

410
00:20:41,578 --> 00:20:43,528
What's the last thing you remember?

411
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:46,364
He pulled out his watch.

412
00:20:46,366 --> 00:20:47,882
Asked if I could hear it ticking.

413
00:20:47,917 --> 00:20:49,333
That's it, then.

414
00:20:49,369 --> 00:20:50,751
His watch.

415
00:20:50,787 --> 00:20:54,288
Anything resembling the ticking
will trigger the impulse.

416
00:20:55,508 --> 00:20:58,159
He's made you a prisoner
in your own skin.

417
00:21:00,463 --> 00:21:02,296
He did it to you.

418
00:21:02,348 --> 00:21:04,348
When we were kids.

419
00:21:06,352 --> 00:21:10,254
At first, he did it to control me.

420
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:12,590
Keep me with him.

421
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:13,908
But then he started

422
00:21:13,943 --> 00:21:17,178
putting other thoughts in my head.

423
00:21:17,213 --> 00:21:19,614
Thoughts a...

424
00:21:19,649 --> 00:21:22,483
Thoughts a brother should never have.

425
00:21:24,487 --> 00:21:27,238
That's why I wanted to kill him.

426
00:21:29,492 --> 00:21:31,659
I won't go back to him.

427
00:21:33,663 --> 00:21:35,329
Not ever.

428
00:21:47,927 --> 00:21:49,143
Yeah!

429
00:21:49,178 --> 00:21:50,645
Everybody!

430
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,481
Come on! Huh?

431
00:21:53,516 --> 00:21:55,366
Ladies and gentlemen!

432
00:21:55,401 --> 00:21:57,101
It is with great excitement

433
00:21:57,103 --> 00:21:58,402
that we welcome you to our show.

434
00:21:58,438 --> 00:21:59,937
It's him.

435
00:21:59,939 --> 00:22:01,606
He's come for me.

436
00:22:01,658 --> 00:22:03,274
Getting you out of here.

437
00:22:03,276 --> 00:22:04,942
To wrestling's most notorious family,

438
00:22:04,944 --> 00:22:08,696
here to entertain and amaze!

439
00:22:08,748 --> 00:22:10,281
The Terrible Tweeds.

440
00:22:10,283 --> 00:22:12,883
Let the show begin!

441
00:22:26,215 --> 00:22:27,465
Harvey, look out behind you!

442
00:22:36,526 --> 00:22:38,059
Hello, sis.

443
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:41,312
We both know you can't kill me.

444
00:22:41,364 --> 00:22:43,931
Not until I remove that nagging

445
00:22:43,967 --> 00:22:46,150
little impulse I planted.

446
00:22:46,202 --> 00:22:48,152
Turn around, hands in the air.

447
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:02,166
Alice, go.

448
00:23:02,218 --> 00:23:04,085
Now.

449
00:23:04,137 --> 00:23:06,170
Good-bye, Mr. Gordon.

450
00:23:06,222 --> 00:23:07,588
No!

451
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,674
I doubt I'll be seeing you again.

452
00:23:09,726 --> 00:23:11,809
Get off me! Let go!

453
00:23:11,844 --> 00:23:13,594
Mr. Gordon!

454
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,194
Ugh.

455
00:23:26,894 --> 00:23:28,427
It really doesn't hurt?

456
00:23:28,429 --> 00:23:29,762
No.

457
00:23:29,814 --> 00:23:33,516
Whatever they did to me at
Indian Hill, I don't feel pain.

458
00:23:33,872 --> 00:23:36,222
So why'd they make a Bruce
Wayne look-alike anyhow?

459
00:23:36,258 --> 00:23:38,224
I don't know.

460
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,593
I didn't even know I looked
like him until a few days ago.

461
00:23:40,645 --> 00:23:43,179
I went to his house thinking
he might have some answers

462
00:23:43,231 --> 00:23:45,181
about who I am.

463
00:23:45,233 --> 00:23:46,232
He didn't.

464
00:23:46,268 --> 00:23:48,184
So you ran off and pretended to be him.

465
00:23:48,236 --> 00:23:50,120
Why?

466
00:23:50,155 --> 00:23:52,155
You'll laugh.

467
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,239
I doubt it.

468
00:23:53,275 --> 00:23:55,642
Neither of you has a sense of humor.

469
00:23:55,677 --> 00:23:57,360
When you came to see
him the other night,

470
00:23:57,412 --> 00:23:59,612
I was watching from the hall.

471
00:23:59,614 --> 00:24:01,581
I saw the way you looked at him.

472
00:24:01,616 --> 00:24:04,450
No one's ever looked at me like that.

473
00:24:04,452 --> 00:24:06,703
I wanted to know how it felt.

474
00:24:06,738 --> 00:24:08,454
You should have your eyes checked.

475
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:11,124
I didn't look at him like anything.

476
00:24:11,126 --> 00:24:13,276
All I mean is that I've
never had a friend.

477
00:24:13,311 --> 00:24:16,763
I've never had anyone.

478
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:20,934
You have no idea what it's like
to spend your whole life alone.

479
00:24:20,969 --> 00:24:23,803
You're actually better off.

480
00:24:23,855 --> 00:24:25,488
People are overrated.

481
00:24:25,524 --> 00:24:27,223
You don't believe that.

482
00:24:27,275 --> 00:24:30,293
My mom left before I could ride a bike.

483
00:24:30,328 --> 00:24:31,861
Never knew my dad.

484
00:24:31,897 --> 00:24:32,979
I had two friends.

485
00:24:32,981 --> 00:24:34,781
One ended up barbecued,

486
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:36,933
and the other's at the
bottom of the river.

487
00:24:36,968 --> 00:24:39,068
What about Bruce Wayne?

488
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,820
Forget about him.

489
00:24:40,872 --> 00:24:42,745
He's even more screwed-up than you.

490
00:24:43,408 --> 00:24:45,427
You're more normal than you think.

491
00:25:09,401 --> 00:25:11,351
Hey. You're up.

492
00:25:14,739 --> 00:25:16,489
What's going on?

493
00:25:16,524 --> 00:25:18,858
Barnes told me what
happened during the attack.

494
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,326
Nothing happened.

495
00:25:20,362 --> 00:25:22,528
I heard the tape from the
interrogation room with Alice.

496
00:25:22,581 --> 00:25:24,030
Listen to me...

497
00:25:24,032 --> 00:25:25,281
Whatever Jervis is doing to you...

498
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:26,666
You need to uncuff me.

499
00:25:27,615 --> 00:25:28,952
I can't do that.

500
00:25:31,773 --> 00:25:34,374
I don't know what I would do
if something happened to you.

501
00:25:36,678 --> 00:25:38,117
You'd be fine.

502
00:25:39,421 --> 00:25:41,047
Do you really believe that?

503
00:25:41,099 --> 00:25:43,466
You seemed to have moved on okay.

504
00:25:44,729 --> 00:25:47,053
Yes, I moved on, Jim.

505
00:25:47,105 --> 00:25:48,354
What choice did I have?

506
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,689
I went through the most

507
00:25:49,724 --> 00:25:52,191
painful period of my life alone.

508
00:25:52,227 --> 00:25:54,527
I cried myself to sleep every night.

509
00:25:54,562 --> 00:25:58,314
And like an idiot, I would
wake up thinking, hoping that

510
00:25:58,366 --> 00:26:01,868
the next day, you would
show up at my door.

511
00:26:01,903 --> 00:26:03,486
But you never did.

512
00:26:04,912 --> 00:26:08,157
Mario was there for me
when I needed someone.

513
00:26:08,209 --> 00:26:12,829
He was there as I tried to
put myself back together.

514
00:26:12,881 --> 00:26:15,481
But I'm the one who doesn't care.

515
00:26:19,653 --> 00:26:22,255
After everything that's happened,

516
00:26:22,257 --> 00:26:24,173
you really have nothing to say to me?

517
00:26:29,431 --> 00:26:31,431
The past is the past.

518
00:26:31,483 --> 00:26:34,284
There's nothing I can do to change that.

519
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:42,661
Alice told me that her brother
preys on anger and regret.

520
00:26:43,696 --> 00:26:46,195
I really don't want that to
be all that's left of us.

521
00:26:47,916 --> 00:26:50,867
You mean all that's left of me.

522
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:54,203
Barnes asked me to put you
on a 48-hour suicide watch.

523
00:26:54,255 --> 00:26:56,273
I've already signed off on it.

524
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:01,427
I know that we can't change the past,

525
00:27:01,463 --> 00:27:04,630
but there's a difference between
moving on and letting go.

526
00:27:13,308 --> 00:27:16,776
Most of you guys have
been with me for a while.

527
00:27:16,811 --> 00:27:18,561
You know me.

528
00:27:19,647 --> 00:27:20,780
And I know Gotham

529
00:27:20,815 --> 00:27:22,648
like the back of my hand.

530
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:26,302
Penguin,

531
00:27:26,338 --> 00:27:30,656
when he's mayor, boys, I promise you,

532
00:27:30,658 --> 00:27:34,660
we are gonna run this city, huh?

533
00:27:34,662 --> 00:27:36,662
- To Butch!
- To Butch!

534
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,499
I...

535
00:27:39,501 --> 00:27:40,917
What?

536
00:27:40,969 --> 00:27:42,919
I lost track of the guy in the glasses.

537
00:27:42,971 --> 00:27:44,003
Nygma?

538
00:27:44,005 --> 00:27:46,839
That skinny loon gave you the slip?!

539
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,842
Yeah?

540
00:27:49,844 --> 00:27:51,978
No.

541
00:27:52,013 --> 00:27:55,014
No, no, that's not possible.

542
00:27:55,066 --> 00:27:56,015
Let's go!

543
00:27:56,067 --> 00:27:57,767
We got to go, guys! Come on!

544
00:28:03,691 --> 00:28:05,992
Two of your brothers are dead.

545
00:28:06,027 --> 00:28:09,295
The other two escaped
with Alice and Jervis.

546
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:12,048
And I need to know where
they're taking her.

547
00:28:18,957 --> 00:28:21,507
Jervis gains a sister and
you lose two brothers?

548
00:28:21,543 --> 00:28:24,043
That don't seem too fair.

549
00:28:24,045 --> 00:28:26,028
Hmm?

550
00:28:26,064 --> 00:28:29,198
I bet you were close growing up, huh?

551
00:28:29,234 --> 00:28:32,552
Wrestling around the house,
driving your mom crazy.

552
00:28:32,554 --> 00:28:35,304
Five little kids all
dreaming of stardom.

553
00:28:36,357 --> 00:28:39,192
Yeah, I'm a fan.

554
00:28:39,227 --> 00:28:41,394
My dad used to always take me down

555
00:28:41,446 --> 00:28:43,563
to the rassling matches at the Garden.

556
00:28:44,465 --> 00:28:47,200
I also happen to know most luchadores...

557
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:51,237
request to be buried in their masks

558
00:28:51,289 --> 00:28:53,039
as a sign of honor...

559
00:28:54,075 --> 00:28:56,042
and respect.

560
00:28:56,077 --> 00:28:57,577
I really, really hope
that wasn't the case

561
00:28:57,629 --> 00:28:59,495
with your brothers.

562
00:29:00,965 --> 00:29:03,499
This freak Jervis did
something to my friend,

563
00:29:03,551 --> 00:29:05,635
and I need him to undo it.

564
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:07,587
Where are they taking her?

565
00:29:10,592 --> 00:29:12,592
Okay, okay, I'll tell you!

566
00:29:28,576 --> 00:29:30,443
Well?

567
00:29:30,478 --> 00:29:33,212
You like it?

568
00:29:42,423 --> 00:29:45,291
I know you were surprised
to see me last night...

569
00:29:47,295 --> 00:29:50,179
and I want you to know
that I forgive you.

570
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:53,733
For everything.

571
00:29:53,768 --> 00:29:56,052
But...

572
00:29:56,087 --> 00:29:59,889
I want you to understand consequences

573
00:29:59,941 --> 00:30:02,742
if you ever leave me again.

574
00:30:02,777 --> 00:30:08,164
I need you to understand
how important you are to me.

575
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:17,990
Don't. Please.

576
00:30:18,042 --> 00:30:19,959
Now...

577
00:30:19,994 --> 00:30:21,827
you might feel

578
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,163
a little prick.

579
00:30:50,976 --> 00:30:52,609
Your escorts agreed

580
00:30:52,644 --> 00:30:53,977
to take a long lunch.

581
00:30:55,313 --> 00:30:57,981
- You know where they took Alice?
- Yeah.

582
00:30:58,033 --> 00:30:59,899
But it's only a matter of
time until Barnes finds out

583
00:30:59,951 --> 00:31:01,568
and sends in the cavalry.

584
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,152
How'd you find me?

585
00:31:03,204 --> 00:31:04,904
Lee.

586
00:31:04,956 --> 00:31:06,906
- Lee?
- Yeah.

587
00:31:06,958 --> 00:31:08,074
She also told me

588
00:31:08,126 --> 00:31:10,410
if you check out on my
watch, it's my head.

589
00:31:10,462 --> 00:31:12,662
Guess you're gonna have to trust me.

590
00:31:12,664 --> 00:31:15,081
Remember to chisel
that into my tombstone.

591
00:31:16,134 --> 00:31:17,467
Let's go.

592
00:31:17,502 --> 00:31:19,218
Thanks, Francisco.

593
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:27,360
Took you long enough.

594
00:31:27,395 --> 00:31:28,478
Where's Selina?

595
00:31:28,513 --> 00:31:29,712
She's not at her squat.

596
00:31:29,748 --> 00:31:31,097
- If you did anything...
- She's fine.

597
00:31:31,149 --> 00:31:33,182
- Where is she?
- She left a little while ago.

598
00:31:33,184 --> 00:31:34,634
I don't know where she went.

599
00:31:34,669 --> 00:31:36,185
I take you in and this
is the thanks I get?

600
00:31:36,187 --> 00:31:38,302
You run around with Selina,
pretending to be me?

601
00:31:38,353 --> 00:31:40,073
Is that why you're angry?

602
00:31:40,108 --> 00:31:41,441
Because I was pretending to be you

603
00:31:41,476 --> 00:31:43,026
or that I spent the day with Selina?

604
00:31:45,668 --> 00:31:46,946
For someone who has everything,

605
00:31:46,998 --> 00:31:49,749
you have no idea what you actually want.

606
00:31:51,036 --> 00:31:53,369
Or maybe you're just
too scared to take it.

607
00:31:53,371 --> 00:31:55,004
At least I know who I am.

608
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,339
Cool your boots, Master Bruce.

609
00:31:56,374 --> 00:31:58,291
Let's all just take a breath, shall we?

610
00:31:58,343 --> 00:31:59,676
Don't worry.

611
00:31:59,711 --> 00:32:01,711
You won't be seeing me anymore.

612
00:32:01,746 --> 00:32:03,162
Neither will she.

613
00:32:03,198 --> 00:32:05,515
I don't know why I was created,

614
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:08,551
but I know I don't belong in Gotham.

615
00:32:12,557 --> 00:32:14,546
Say good-bye to Selina for me.

616
00:32:17,562 --> 00:32:19,312
And thank her for the kiss.

617
00:32:43,138 --> 00:32:45,755
What are you going to use that for?

618
00:32:45,807 --> 00:32:48,891
Oh, I imagine I'll...

619
00:32:48,927 --> 00:32:50,977
mix it into

620
00:32:51,012 --> 00:32:53,112
some public drinking fountain.

621
00:32:53,148 --> 00:32:56,933
Create a few dozen monsters.

622
00:32:56,935 --> 00:32:58,518
Please, Jervis.

623
00:32:58,570 --> 00:32:59,919
Please.

624
00:32:59,954 --> 00:33:02,822
- I'll do whatever you want.
- You will now.

625
00:33:02,857 --> 00:33:04,157
Because you know the price

626
00:33:04,192 --> 00:33:07,326
other people will pay if you don't.

627
00:33:08,947 --> 00:33:12,031
I don't know what I would
ever do if I lost you.

628
00:33:14,035 --> 00:33:16,119
That connection.

629
00:33:16,121 --> 00:33:18,154
It keeps me sane.

630
00:33:19,758 --> 00:33:22,008
It always has.

631
00:33:23,094 --> 00:33:24,127
Tetch?

632
00:33:24,129 --> 00:33:26,262
Jervis?

633
00:33:26,297 --> 00:33:28,131
Don't move!

634
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:33,352
Mr. Gordon. I can't say
I'm entirely surprised.

635
00:33:33,388 --> 00:33:34,937
So stubborn.

636
00:33:34,973 --> 00:33:37,306
- Let her go now.
- You know I can't do that.

637
00:33:37,308 --> 00:33:40,860
But if you let me leave

638
00:33:40,895 --> 00:33:42,195
with my dear sister,

639
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:45,948
my dear Alice...

640
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:50,536
then I'll free you from
that nasty little impulse.

641
00:33:50,572 --> 00:33:53,539
Maybe you can live a long, happy...

642
00:33:53,575 --> 00:33:56,325
Well, a long life.

643
00:34:00,131 --> 00:34:01,864
Let her go and you live.

644
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,132
That's the deal.

645
00:34:04,335 --> 00:34:05,384
One question.

646
00:34:13,645 --> 00:34:15,178
Do you hear that?

647
00:34:23,688 --> 00:34:24,520
Jim!

648
00:34:29,994 --> 00:34:31,944
We both know what you really want.

649
00:34:31,996 --> 00:34:34,747
I saw it in your eyes the first time

650
00:34:34,783 --> 00:34:36,449
we met.

651
00:34:36,501 --> 00:34:38,334
You want to be free.

652
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,370
Free from the pain.

653
00:34:43,675 --> 00:34:44,674
And you can be.

654
00:34:48,513 --> 00:34:50,129
Stop fighting

655
00:34:50,181 --> 00:34:51,881
and let go.

656
00:34:55,153 --> 00:34:57,353
The past is the past.

657
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,056
There's nothing I can do to change that.

658
00:35:04,395 --> 00:35:06,729
There's a difference between
moving on and letting go.

659
00:35:06,731 --> 00:35:08,114
No!

660
00:35:18,743 --> 00:35:21,043
Well, well, Mr. Gordon breaks my spell!

661
00:35:23,581 --> 00:35:25,748
I daresay it's time we bid
this foul city our good-bye.

662
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,749
- No!
- Alice!

663
00:35:26,751 --> 00:35:28,084
I'll never go with you!

664
00:35:28,086 --> 00:35:29,385
Why do you say such things?!

665
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,721
We belong together. You know that.

666
00:35:31,756 --> 00:35:32,972
I love you.

667
00:35:33,007 --> 00:35:34,674
- You're insane!
- No, no!

668
00:35:36,928 --> 00:35:38,477
No!

669
00:35:38,513 --> 00:35:41,347
No!

670
00:35:41,399 --> 00:35:44,100
You killed her!

671
00:36:04,572 --> 00:36:07,123
You want to explain yourself?

672
00:36:07,158 --> 00:36:09,042
I was following a lead.

673
00:36:09,077 --> 00:36:10,576
You were following some misguided notion

674
00:36:10,629 --> 00:36:11,828
about friendship.

675
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,579
James Gordon is gonna get you killed

676
00:36:13,632 --> 00:36:15,915
one day, you get that?

677
00:36:15,967 --> 00:36:17,166
Maybe.

678
00:36:17,218 --> 00:36:18,584
But until that day,

679
00:36:18,586 --> 00:36:21,554
I will never turn my back on him.

680
00:36:29,931 --> 00:36:31,264
The night that all of Gotham

681
00:36:31,316 --> 00:36:32,565
has been waiting for.

682
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,067
The final results should
be coming in shortly.

683
00:36:34,102 --> 00:36:35,818
This is it.

684
00:36:35,854 --> 00:36:37,820
The moment I've been waiting for.

685
00:36:37,856 --> 00:36:38,988
Indeed.

686
00:36:39,024 --> 00:36:39,939
You!

687
00:36:39,991 --> 00:36:41,941
You, you ruined everything!

688
00:36:41,993 --> 00:36:43,276
Butch, release him this instant!

689
00:36:43,328 --> 00:36:44,527
What is going on?!

690
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:45,828
I'll tell you what's going on.

691
00:36:45,864 --> 00:36:47,330
He just cost you the election.

692
00:36:47,365 --> 00:36:49,449
He went to every district official

693
00:36:49,451 --> 00:36:50,583
and took the money back.

694
00:36:50,618 --> 00:36:52,669
Said you wanted to run a clean election.

695
00:36:52,704 --> 00:36:55,254
Tell me this is not true.

696
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:57,674
I'm afraid Butch is right. For once.

697
00:36:57,709 --> 00:37:00,593
Why?

698
00:37:00,628 --> 00:37:03,018
After everything I've done for you.

699
00:37:03,094 --> 00:37:05,478
Everything we could've done together.

700
00:37:05,513 --> 00:37:07,680
You betrayed me.

701
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:09,648
Butch!

702
00:37:11,986 --> 00:37:13,402
Give me one reason why I shouldn't

703
00:37:13,438 --> 00:37:15,354
let Butch kill you where you stand.

704
00:37:15,406 --> 00:37:16,989
Well, there are about 30 witnesses...

705
00:37:17,024 --> 00:37:18,491
I don't care!

706
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:21,277
And there's that.

707
00:37:21,329 --> 00:37:22,828
In what can only be viewed

708
00:37:22,864 --> 00:37:25,531
as a seismic shift even
by Gotham standards,

709
00:37:25,533 --> 00:37:28,751
former underworld
kingpin Oswald Cobblepot

710
00:37:28,786 --> 00:37:32,171
has won the mayor's
office by a landslide.

711
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,793
momentum based largely on
his outspoken criticism...

712
00:37:37,845 --> 00:37:39,345
I still won.

713
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:42,131
Of how city officials and
the GCPD mishandled...

714
00:37:42,183 --> 00:37:44,683
They really want me as mayor.

715
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:46,185
Yes.

716
00:37:48,556 --> 00:37:49,939
I can't be bought,

717
00:37:49,974 --> 00:37:52,654
but I can be stolen with one glance.

718
00:37:54,028 --> 00:37:57,446
I'm worthless to one,
but priceless to two.

719
00:37:59,066 --> 00:38:01,400
Love.

720
00:38:04,705 --> 00:38:06,739
Cobblepot! Cobblepot!

721
00:38:08,826 --> 00:38:11,127
They love me.

722
00:38:11,162 --> 00:38:12,661
If you would've bought the election,

723
00:38:12,713 --> 00:38:13,963
you would've never known.

724
00:38:13,998 --> 00:38:16,081
But now you do.

725
00:38:17,235 --> 00:38:19,385
Feels good, doesn't it?

726
00:38:20,805 --> 00:38:22,505
How did you know I would win?

727
00:38:22,557 --> 00:38:25,591
I believe in you, Oswald.

728
00:38:25,593 --> 00:38:28,010
Even when you don't believe in yourself.

729
00:38:30,565 --> 00:38:32,765
You.

730
00:38:32,817 --> 00:38:34,984
You never believed I could
win this election on my own.

731
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:38,487
I think maybe you're not
cut out for this after all.

732
00:38:38,523 --> 00:38:39,655
What?! You got to be kidding me.

733
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:40,739
- This guy...
- Don't worry.

734
00:38:40,775 --> 00:38:43,108
I still need someone to crack skulls.

735
00:38:44,612 --> 00:38:45,945
Come, Ed.

736
00:38:45,997 --> 00:38:47,863
We have plans to make.

737
00:38:57,542 --> 00:38:58,624
You think we'll ever see him again?

738
00:38:58,626 --> 00:39:00,626
Well, that I very much
doubt, Master Bruce.

739
00:39:00,628 --> 00:39:04,096
I reckon he's gonna try and
get as far away from Gotham

740
00:39:04,131 --> 00:39:05,130
as he possibly can.

741
00:39:05,183 --> 00:39:06,882
I still wonder why
Hugo Strange made him.

742
00:39:06,918 --> 00:39:08,133
Long lonely nights

743
00:39:08,186 --> 00:39:10,486
in the laboratory, but
wanted someone to talk to.

744
00:39:10,521 --> 00:39:14,857
Or some other nefarious reason.

745
00:39:14,892 --> 00:39:16,775
Perhaps.

746
00:39:21,315 --> 00:39:22,898
There is one thing.

747
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:25,568
Yes, Master Bruce?

748
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:28,537
Do you think Selina really kissed him?

749
00:39:28,573 --> 00:39:30,406
- Aw, bloody hell.
- I mean, you've had

750
00:39:30,458 --> 00:39:31,490
training in interrogation, right?

751
00:39:31,542 --> 00:39:33,158
You can tell when someone's lying.

752
00:39:33,211 --> 00:39:34,751
No, I'm not gonna have
this conversation.

753
00:39:34,815 --> 00:39:36,655
And if she did kiss him, do you
think she thought he was me?

754
00:39:36,834 --> 00:39:38,713
Good night, Master Bruce.

755
00:39:39,383 --> 00:39:41,450
I bet she thought he was me.

756
00:39:49,844 --> 00:39:51,310
Hey.

757
00:39:51,345 --> 00:39:52,895
Hey.

758
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:54,847
You're here late.

759
00:39:54,899 --> 00:39:57,349
Tweeds really did a
number on this place.

760
00:39:57,351 --> 00:40:00,352
Guess I'm medical examiner-slash-medic.

761
00:40:00,404 --> 00:40:03,355
Slash-resident therapist.

762
00:40:04,859 --> 00:40:07,326
I wanted to thank you

763
00:40:07,361 --> 00:40:09,745
for telling Bullock where to find me.

764
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:12,331
Heard about what happened
with Alice. You okay?

765
00:40:12,366 --> 00:40:14,116
- Yeah.
- No.

766
00:40:14,168 --> 00:40:15,534
I mean are you okay?

767
00:40:15,586 --> 00:40:18,254
Whatever Jervis did to me...

768
00:40:18,289 --> 00:40:20,539
it's over now.

769
00:40:21,626 --> 00:40:23,042
I'm glad.

770
00:40:23,094 --> 00:40:24,877
Guess I should get going.

771
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,012
Lee.

772
00:40:28,716 --> 00:40:31,767
There's something I... need to tell you.

773
00:40:31,802 --> 00:40:33,185
Something I should have told you

774
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,137
the moment I saw you back in Gotham.

775
00:40:35,189 --> 00:40:37,356
Everything you said today...
I'm sorry about that.

776
00:40:37,391 --> 00:40:39,608
Don't...

777
00:40:39,644 --> 00:40:41,293
You were right.

778
00:40:41,329 --> 00:40:43,896
And after everything
that happened today...

779
00:40:47,485 --> 00:40:49,835
This is harder than I thought.

780
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:52,237
What is it, Jim?

781
00:40:54,392 --> 00:40:56,408
I'm happy for you.

782
00:40:58,829 --> 00:41:00,546
You are?

783
00:41:00,581 --> 00:41:02,514
Trying to be.

784
00:41:03,968 --> 00:41:06,135
Maybe we can start there.

785
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:07,920
Yeah.

786
00:41:07,972 --> 00:41:10,255
I think we can do that.

787
00:41:31,412 --> 00:41:33,112
Bruce Wayne?

788
00:41:34,115 --> 00:41:35,364
No.

789
00:41:35,416 --> 00:41:37,333
But you could be.

790
00:41:37,368 --> 00:41:39,952
In fact, you could be so much more.

791
00:41:40,004 --> 00:41:42,154
Who are you?

792
00:41:42,189 --> 00:41:44,873
You might think of us as your parents.

793
00:41:44,925 --> 00:41:49,011
We've been looking for
you for a long time.

794
00:41:55,302 --> 00:41:58,103
It is with a humble heart

795
00:41:58,139 --> 00:42:01,890
that I accept the trust placed
in me by this great city

796
00:42:01,942 --> 00:42:04,360
to become your mayor.

797
00:42:04,395 --> 00:42:07,980
The people have spoken, and
I have heard their call.

798
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:11,533
And as my first act as mayor,

799
00:42:11,569 --> 00:42:15,237
I would like to introduce
you to my chief of staff,

800
00:42:15,289 --> 00:42:18,424
Mr. Edward Nygma!

801
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,887
No.
