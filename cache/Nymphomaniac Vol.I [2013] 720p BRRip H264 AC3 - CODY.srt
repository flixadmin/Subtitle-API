1
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:26,271
Hello?

2
00:05:31,256 --> 00:05:33,457
You've had an accident.

3
00:05:35,616 --> 00:05:39,117
You need an ambulance. I'll call
for one. I'll be right back.

4
00:05:40,053 --> 00:05:41,396
Lie still here.

5
00:05:41,462 --> 00:05:42,828
No.

6
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:44,734
No.

7
00:05:45,126 --> 00:05:47,160
No what?

8
00:05:47,161 --> 00:05:50,047
I don't need an ambulance.

9
00:05:50,073 --> 00:05:53,841
I can clearly see you do.
I'll call for one.

10
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:56,459
In that case, I'll be up and gone

11
00:05:56,498 --> 00:05:58,697
before you have the
time to come back.

12
00:06:01,474 --> 00:06:03,243
That will hurt.

13
00:06:03,244 --> 00:06:07,412
That's possible, but it
doesn't matter to me.

14
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:14,003
I assume you don't want me
to call the police either.

15
00:06:15,448 --> 00:06:18,016
Yes, that's exactly right.

16
00:06:23,763 --> 00:06:26,031
Is there anything you want?

17
00:06:34,741 --> 00:06:38,810
I'd like a cup of
tea with some milk.

18
00:06:41,491 --> 00:06:43,215
Well...

19
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:46,372
You have to come with me.

20
00:06:48,388 --> 00:06:51,156
I don't serve tea in the street.

21
00:06:53,944 --> 00:06:55,945
Can you walk?

22
00:06:56,635 --> 00:06:58,335
Yeah.

23
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,728
I've even bought a cake.

24
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,398
I'll wash your clothes.

25
00:07:12,554 --> 00:07:15,590
- Not my coat.
- It smells rather badly.

26
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,983
It's my coat.

27
00:07:18,911 --> 00:07:20,545
It's your coat.

28
00:07:23,156 --> 00:07:25,191
So what happened?

29
00:07:25,574 --> 00:07:27,941
Were you robbed?

30
00:07:31,538 --> 00:07:34,099
It's my own fault.

31
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:38,052
I'm just a bad human being.

32
00:07:38,995 --> 00:07:40,818
I've never met a bad human being.

33
00:07:40,903 --> 00:07:42,303
Well, you have now.

34
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,782
Do you want to talk about it?

35
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,871
You wouldn't understand.

36
00:07:52,285 --> 00:07:54,485
Well, try me.

37
00:07:56,548 --> 00:07:59,183
But I wouldn't know where to start.

38
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:12,172
Why is that ridiculous
fishhook hanging there?

39
00:08:12,504 --> 00:08:14,941
It's a fly.

40
00:08:14,942 --> 00:08:18,011
I caught a fish with it once,
a rather big one,

41
00:08:18,054 --> 00:08:20,054
strangely enough.

42
00:08:23,082 --> 00:08:28,354
<i>Fly-fishing is about tying feathers
and other things to a hook</i>

43
00:08:28,355 --> 00:08:32,158
so it resembles something
the fish likes to eat.

44
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,961
And then because the
fly is very light,

45
00:08:34,962 --> 00:08:37,462
you have to have a
line that is heavy.

46
00:08:38,292 --> 00:08:41,027
It creates the velocity
when you cast.

47
00:08:46,707 --> 00:08:48,409
You fish a lot?

48
00:08:48,809 --> 00:08:51,577
Well, some...

49
00:08:52,397 --> 00:08:54,197
But I don't catch much.

50
00:08:56,094 --> 00:08:57,618
<i>When I was young, I...</i>

51
00:08:57,646 --> 00:09:00,447
<i>I had a book I... I worshipped.</i>

52
00:09:01,882 --> 00:09:03,984
<i>It was an old book by Izaak Walton</i>

53
00:09:04,164 --> 00:09:06,831
<i>called "The Complete Angler".</i>

54
00:09:09,229 --> 00:09:13,031
<i>It was like a romantic
nature Bible to me.</i>

55
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,529
Maybe I know where to start.

56
00:09:24,077 --> 00:09:26,880
But if you're to
understand, I'll...

57
00:09:26,881 --> 00:09:30,250
I'll have to tell you
the whole story,

58
00:09:30,414 --> 00:09:32,646
and it'll be long.

59
00:09:33,605 --> 00:09:36,508
Long... is good.

60
00:09:37,142 --> 00:09:40,376
And moral, I'm afraid.

61
00:09:49,065 --> 00:09:51,000
<i>To begin with the bait,</i>

62
00:09:51,696 --> 00:09:54,440
<i>I discovered my cunt
as a two-year-old.</i>

63
00:09:57,409 --> 00:10:01,046
<i>At an early age,
I was mechanically inclined.</i>

64
00:10:01,312 --> 00:10:03,883
<i>Kinetic energy, for example,</i>

65
00:10:03,884 --> 00:10:06,586
<i>has always fascinated me.</i>

66
00:10:06,612 --> 00:10:09,714
<i>And my friend...
let's call her B...</i>

67
00:10:10,091 --> 00:10:12,758
<i>Always came up with the ideas.</i>

68
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:17,508
<i>Playing frogs was one
of B's classics.</i>

69
00:10:42,177 --> 00:10:43,661
<i>Joe, are you all right?</i>

70
00:10:43,761 --> 00:10:45,395
Just a moment!

71
00:10:47,571 --> 00:10:49,238
Are you done?

72
00:10:59,795 --> 00:11:03,009
For Christ's sakes,
leave them alone.

73
00:11:03,443 --> 00:11:05,889
<i>I loved my father very much.</i>

74
00:11:05,967 --> 00:11:07,701
<i>He was a doctor.</i>

75
00:11:08,147 --> 00:11:10,693
<i>My mother's name was Katherine.</i>

76
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:13,003
<i>My father called her Kay.</i>

77
00:11:14,354 --> 00:11:18,490
<i>I suppose she was what you'd call
a cold bitch.</i>

78
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:22,604
<i>She always had her back turned
when she played solitaire.</i>

79
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:25,331
<i>I hated solitaire.</i>

80
00:11:31,251 --> 00:11:35,845
<i>When we had P.E., I'd climb up into
the ropes and hang there for ages</i>

81
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,037
<i>with the rope between my legs.</i>

82
00:11:39,477 --> 00:11:42,115
<i>"The sensation" we called it.</i>

83
00:11:42,116 --> 00:11:47,085
<i>I remember very distinctly
this word, "sensation."</i>

84
00:11:52,621 --> 00:11:56,857
<i>Perhaps the only difference
between me and other people</i>

85
00:11:57,163 --> 00:12:01,166
<i>was that I've always demanded
more from the sunset.</i>

86
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:06,338
<i>More spectacular colours when
the sun hit the horizon.</i>

87
00:12:08,525 --> 00:12:11,492
That's perhaps my only sin.

88
00:12:14,147 --> 00:12:17,050
Why are you insisting
that children are sinful?

89
00:12:17,618 --> 00:12:20,751
Not children. Me.

90
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:24,162
I don't see sin anywhere,

91
00:12:24,172 --> 00:12:26,238
but then I'm not religious.

92
00:12:26,261 --> 00:12:29,123
That's because you don't
know the rest of the story.

93
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:31,783
And by the way, I'm
not religious either.

94
00:12:32,433 --> 00:12:36,425
Why would you take the most unsympathetic
aspect of religion such as

95
00:12:36,612 --> 00:12:38,537
the concept of sin,

96
00:12:39,372 --> 00:12:42,274
and let it survive beyond religion?

97
00:12:45,445 --> 00:12:48,948
I don't understand
this self-hatred.

98
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:50,734
That's what I said...

99
00:12:50,754 --> 00:12:53,387
- You wouldn't understand.
- No, I'm...

100
00:12:54,402 --> 00:12:56,403
I'm sorry, I'll shut up.

101
00:12:57,878 --> 00:12:59,713
Please continue.

102
00:13:11,171 --> 00:13:15,174
Nervus pudendus.

103
00:13:15,904 --> 00:13:21,008
Nervus dorsalis clitoridis.

104
00:13:51,411 --> 00:13:55,415
<i>My dad loved telling me about
the trees and their leaves</i>

105
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:59,283
<i>and considered it part
of a good education.</i>

106
00:13:59,676 --> 00:14:02,113
When the ash tree was created,

107
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:05,958
it made all the other trees
in the forest jealous.

108
00:14:06,986 --> 00:14:09,319
It was the most beautiful tree.

109
00:14:12,165 --> 00:14:14,932
You couldn't say
anything bad about it.

110
00:14:17,293 --> 00:14:19,460
Then in the winter...

111
00:14:21,408 --> 00:14:24,310
When the ash tree lost
all of its leaves...

112
00:14:26,995 --> 00:14:31,032
All the trees noticed its black
buds and started laughing.

113
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:33,720
"Oh, look...

114
00:14:33,721 --> 00:14:37,923
"The ash tree's had its
fingers in the ashes."

115
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,660
See?

116
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:47,598
You can always tell the ash tree
in winter by the black buds.

117
00:14:49,302 --> 00:14:53,573
<i>He especially loved the childish
educational stories he told</i>

118
00:14:53,574 --> 00:14:56,642
<i>to help me remember
what I had learned.</i>

119
00:14:57,517 --> 00:14:59,754
<i>I knew how much he loved
telling those stories,</i>

120
00:14:59,838 --> 00:15:04,016
<i>so sometimes I pretended
I had forgotten them.</i>

121
00:15:12,774 --> 00:15:14,665
Am I boring you?

122
00:15:14,758 --> 00:15:19,965
No, I'm just looking forward to how you
will get fishing weaved into your tale.

123
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,094
You could start with the
fly on the wall there.

124
00:15:24,147 --> 00:15:26,215
It's called a nymph.

125
00:15:26,474 --> 00:15:29,959
It would tie in elegantly with
your discussion about nymphomania.

126
00:15:30,033 --> 00:15:35,913
A nymph is an early stage
in the life of an insect.

127
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:40,396
<i>As a quite young nymph,</i>

128
00:15:40,475 --> 00:15:44,076
it was imperative for me to
get rid of my virginity.

129
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,023
Hopla.

130
00:15:46,834 --> 00:15:49,071
I kind of knew this boy J,

131
00:15:49,619 --> 00:15:51,970
who had a moped.

132
00:15:52,058 --> 00:15:54,593
So in my eyes, he was
rather sophisticated.

133
00:15:55,955 --> 00:16:01,804
I was 15, and perhaps my girlish
romantic expectations were a bit high.

134
00:16:04,952 --> 00:16:08,715
<i>But he had good strong hands.</i>

135
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:11,616
<i>I liked his hands.</i>

136
00:16:13,771 --> 00:16:15,171
Hello?

137
00:16:16,456 --> 00:16:18,689
- Hi.
- Hi.

138
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:36,041
If I asked you to take my
virginity, would that be a problem?

139
00:16:37,097 --> 00:16:38,931
No, I don't see a problem.

140
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,613
So, um...

141
00:16:47,252 --> 00:16:50,322
Where shall I go?

142
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,772
It's the fucking carburator.

143
00:17:08,308 --> 00:17:10,644
I just can't work it out.
Can you imagine that?

144
00:17:12,712 --> 00:17:14,113
That's not very good.

145
00:17:14,152 --> 00:17:16,254
- Hmm?
- That's not very good.

146
00:17:16,297 --> 00:17:19,733
No, it bloody isn't. It ruins the
whole idea of having a moped.

147
00:17:22,934 --> 00:17:25,467
You should probably take
off your knickers, yeah?

148
00:18:10,616 --> 00:18:14,673
<i>He shoved his cock inside me
and humped me three times.</i>

149
00:18:22,347 --> 00:18:27,052
<i>Then he turned me over
like a sack of potatoes...</i>

150
00:18:33,792 --> 00:18:36,794
<i>Then he humped me five
times in the ass.</i>

151
00:19:43,663 --> 00:19:47,766
<i>I never forgot those two
humiliating numbers.</i>

152
00:19:48,763 --> 00:19:50,597
<i>Three and five?</i>

153
00:19:50,613 --> 00:19:52,546
Those are Fibonacci numbers.

154
00:19:55,908 --> 00:19:57,310
That may be.

155
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:00,412
In any case, it hurt like hell.

156
00:20:00,413 --> 00:20:03,916
I swore I'd never sleep
with anyone again.

157
00:20:03,917 --> 00:20:06,751
But of course, that only
lasted a short while.

158
00:20:07,786 --> 00:20:10,556
And now to get back
to your fishing...

159
00:20:11,028 --> 00:20:15,364
<i>A couple of years later
I was at my friend B's.</i>

160
00:20:15,437 --> 00:20:18,572
<i>And as always,
she had a new idea...</i>

161
00:20:18,698 --> 00:20:21,643
<i>Financed by her younger
brother's piggy banks,</i>

162
00:20:21,686 --> 00:20:24,454
<i>which she regularly emptied.</i>

163
00:20:28,807 --> 00:20:34,613
<i>We put on clothes later known
as the fuck-me-now clothes.</i>

164
00:20:35,432 --> 00:20:38,083
<i>The idea was a competition.</i>

165
00:20:38,084 --> 00:20:40,787
<i>We were to go on a train trip.</i>

166
00:20:41,155 --> 00:20:44,791
<i>B said there was no
need for tickets.</i>

167
00:20:44,792 --> 00:20:49,116
<i>The one who had fucked the most men
when we reached the destination</i>

168
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,599
<i>would win the chocolate sweets.</i>

169
00:20:59,055 --> 00:21:01,156
<i>♪ Get your motor running ♪</i>

174
00:21:14,854 --> 00:21:16,821
<i>May I interrupt here?</i>

175
00:21:17,557 --> 00:21:20,959
What you were doing when you
walked down that corridor...

176
00:21:21,124 --> 00:21:23,892
You were reading the river.

177
00:21:28,066 --> 00:21:31,869
<i>♪ Born to be wild ♪</i>

178
00:21:35,842 --> 00:21:41,047
<i>Most of the large fish stay sheltered
from the current to save energy</i>

179
00:21:41,048 --> 00:21:42,883
<i>and to hide from the prey.</i>

180
00:21:42,941 --> 00:21:47,452
<i>Where the fish hides in the stream
entails a very complicated hierarchy.</i>

181
00:21:48,848 --> 00:21:52,274
<i>The topography decides where the
most attractive places are,</i>

182
00:21:52,326 --> 00:21:55,361
<i>and the biggest fish
choose the best positions.</i>

183
00:21:59,788 --> 00:22:02,047
<i>Smile and make eye contact.</i>

184
00:22:02,078 --> 00:22:05,054
If you have to talk, remember
to ask a lot of wh-questions

185
00:22:05,082 --> 00:22:07,015
if you want more than
a yes-or-no answer.

186
00:22:07,048 --> 00:22:08,359
Then it'll just happen on its own.

187
00:22:08,417 --> 00:22:11,094
You just take them to the lavatory
and you have sex with them.

188
00:22:11,578 --> 00:22:15,180
Oh. But what if it's nasty?

189
00:22:15,181 --> 00:22:18,783
Then you just think of the
bag of chocolate sweeties.

190
00:22:49,815 --> 00:22:53,384
What... what time is it?

191
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:56,903
10:00

192
00:23:11,286 --> 00:23:13,754
Where do you come from?

193
00:23:15,274 --> 00:23:17,208
From home.

194
00:23:23,864 --> 00:23:26,867
Who knows where the lavatory is?

195
00:23:26,954 --> 00:23:28,688
Well, if you take a right,

196
00:23:28,689 --> 00:23:32,257
you will arrive at a lavatory
at the end of the car.

197
00:23:32,258 --> 00:23:34,884
At the same time, it is
so cleverly arranged

198
00:23:34,891 --> 00:23:39,231
that if you take a left turn,
you will also arrive at a lavatory,

199
00:23:39,356 --> 00:23:42,924
since at the end of the
next car there is also one.

200
00:23:45,571 --> 00:23:47,905
I'll show you where
the lavatory is.

201
00:24:14,368 --> 00:24:17,454
<i>It turned out to be
shockingly easy.</i>

202
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:20,489
<i>In no time, B was
ahead, five to three.</i>

203
00:24:21,311 --> 00:24:22,993
And it was exactly right.

204
00:24:23,031 --> 00:24:25,264
Look them in the eye and smile.

205
00:24:26,652 --> 00:24:28,520
But then suddenly it stopped.

206
00:24:28,966 --> 00:24:33,168
That's a very clear parallel
to fishing in the stream.

207
00:24:33,373 --> 00:24:36,589
As it happens,
either none of the fish are feeding

208
00:24:36,589 --> 00:24:38,393
or they all feed at the same time.

209
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,621
They go into feeding frenzy.

210
00:24:40,927 --> 00:24:42,448
All bite.

211
00:24:42,475 --> 00:24:45,542
And then just as suddenly
as it started, it stops.

212
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,650
The fish most readily bite at
the beginning of a light rain,

213
00:24:48,658 --> 00:24:51,454
and I think that's
because they feel safe

214
00:24:51,487 --> 00:24:53,155
when they swim in the stream.

215
00:24:53,595 --> 00:24:55,587
Because they can't
be seen from above

216
00:24:55,634 --> 00:24:58,501
if the water's surface is disturbed.

217
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,600
But then it started again,

218
00:25:02,687 --> 00:25:05,054
although a bit more slowly.

219
00:25:05,133 --> 00:25:07,635
Yeah, and I think I know how.

220
00:25:07,793 --> 00:25:10,695
Because fly-fishing can
be done in several phases.

221
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:15,553
And if the fish stop biting,
you move on to phase two.

222
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,243
And in phase two, you not
only imitate an insect

223
00:25:19,275 --> 00:25:21,743
but an insect in trouble.

224
00:25:22,127 --> 00:25:24,408
You pull... You pull the line.

225
00:25:24,442 --> 00:25:27,410
You tug it... Irregularly,

226
00:25:27,451 --> 00:25:29,260
<i>so the fish gets the
impression that</i>

227
00:25:29,332 --> 00:25:31,967
it's dealing with an
injured and easy prey.

228
00:25:32,545 --> 00:25:34,194
And then helplessly

229
00:25:34,226 --> 00:25:36,710
<i>let the fly float
down the river again.</i>

230
00:25:36,757 --> 00:25:38,625
Then half-heartedly

231
00:25:38,696 --> 00:25:40,896
<i>make a few jumps forward again.</i>

232
00:25:43,155 --> 00:25:44,240
It can be done...

233
00:25:44,298 --> 00:25:46,465
It can be done very elegantly.

234
00:25:59,785 --> 00:26:01,753
Are you all right?

235
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,203
It's Betty.

236
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:07,590
I was just told that
she's very ill.

237
00:26:07,631 --> 00:26:10,398
Is Betty a close family member?

238
00:26:13,285 --> 00:26:15,652
You could say that.

239
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:18,191
She's my dwarf hamster.

240
00:26:18,211 --> 00:26:20,045
<i>Dwarf hamster?</i>

241
00:26:20,226 --> 00:26:21,714
<i>You can't be serious.</i>

242
00:26:21,751 --> 00:26:23,752
<i>Well, what was I to do?</i>

243
00:26:24,027 --> 00:26:27,527
<i>And then I did have a dwarf
hamster when I was young.</i>

244
00:26:27,594 --> 00:26:29,620
<i>That you were very close to?</i>

245
00:26:29,834 --> 00:26:31,968
<i>Not at all. A bloody nuisance.</i>

246
00:26:32,722 --> 00:26:34,306
<i>Dwarf hamster.</i>

247
00:26:34,377 --> 00:26:37,042
It would've been worse
if it were a person.

248
00:26:37,424 --> 00:26:39,211
Don't say that.

249
00:26:39,736 --> 00:26:42,915
I'm extremely fond of my hamster.

250
00:26:42,916 --> 00:26:46,985
Yes, I think that's a rather
cynical thing to say about Betty.

251
00:26:47,181 --> 00:26:51,291
Yes, I had made the cage nice
and cosy for her when...

252
00:26:51,342 --> 00:26:54,008
- When I got her.
- And Betty liked that?

253
00:26:55,294 --> 00:26:57,830
Betty was excited.

254
00:26:58,229 --> 00:27:02,234
<i>One of nature's most
meaningless creatures.</i>

255
00:27:02,235 --> 00:27:05,103
<i>You're aware that the
choice of a dwarf hamster</i>

256
00:27:05,104 --> 00:27:08,207
<i>possibly suggests certain
sexual connotations.</i>

257
00:27:08,208 --> 00:27:09,842
<i>I can see that now, but</i>

258
00:27:09,843 --> 00:27:13,144
<i>it was really not
a conscious choice.</i>

259
00:27:21,999 --> 00:27:25,301
Can you show me where
the lavatory is?

260
00:27:26,082 --> 00:27:29,319
I... have to blow my nose.

261
00:27:41,616 --> 00:27:43,918
<i>We were running out of subjects,</i>

262
00:27:43,974 --> 00:27:46,242
<i>and B was ahead on points,</i>

263
00:27:46,803 --> 00:27:50,648
<i>which led us to S's
first-class compartment.</i>

264
00:27:54,621 --> 00:27:56,556
Tickets, please!

265
00:28:02,126 --> 00:28:03,207
Thank you.

266
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:04,866
Ladies?

267
00:28:06,365 --> 00:28:07,732
Tickets?

268
00:28:13,266 --> 00:28:14,967
Well...

269
00:28:16,441 --> 00:28:18,727
I think I might've lost it.

270
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:20,213
Perhaps.

271
00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:23,904
Dropped yours as well, did ya?

272
00:28:23,976 --> 00:28:27,979
I haven't bought a ticket
for your shitty train.

273
00:28:28,089 --> 00:28:31,784
It's so bloody slow, we should've been at
the end of the track half an hour ago.

274
00:28:31,815 --> 00:28:34,983
Regardless of delays, you still
need a ticket, sweetheart.

275
00:28:35,774 --> 00:28:38,508
£8 each, please.

276
00:28:39,974 --> 00:28:41,373
Oh!

277
00:28:41,945 --> 00:28:45,014
I accidentally tore it up.

278
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:48,215
You can't expect me to
pay for scraps of paper.

279
00:28:48,483 --> 00:28:50,312
- Have another one.
- Oh, great idea.

280
00:28:50,382 --> 00:28:53,218
Oh, that one's disappeared too.

281
00:28:53,358 --> 00:28:56,374
I can always just get the police to
collect your payment at the next station.

282
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:59,218
- How about that?
- Now let's just take it easy here, shall we?

283
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:01,976
Apparently the young ladies
have left without any money.

284
00:29:02,019 --> 00:29:04,031
If it's okay with you, I'd
like to pay for their tickets.

285
00:29:04,062 --> 00:29:06,964
No sir, it's not. Just leave
your money where it is.

286
00:29:06,989 --> 00:29:08,856
- We'll let the police deal with these two.
- Actually,

287
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,288
we did have sort of an
agreement that I was to pay.

288
00:29:11,335 --> 00:29:12,868
I just forgot about it.

289
00:29:16,183 --> 00:29:17,618
I see.

290
00:29:17,668 --> 00:29:20,236
Two first-class tickets...

291
00:29:20,708 --> 00:29:23,241
For two first-class ladies.

292
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,301
Enjoy the rest of your journey.

293
00:29:28,568 --> 00:29:30,736
Tickets, please!

294
00:29:32,161 --> 00:29:36,029
Now that you've been
so nice to us...

295
00:29:37,389 --> 00:29:39,820
We'd like to be nice to you too.

296
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:43,326
Oh, that's very kind of you,
but there's no need.

297
00:29:47,332 --> 00:29:49,400
I mean that.

298
00:29:53,066 --> 00:29:54,867
Well, I've already lost anyway.

299
00:29:57,376 --> 00:30:01,746
I'm willing to give you
five extra points...

300
00:30:03,858 --> 00:30:06,159
If you can get that one in there.

301
00:30:08,688 --> 00:30:11,467
<i>I decided, perhaps
a bit desperately,</i>

302
00:30:11,517 --> 00:30:15,856
<i>that the only thing standing between
me and the bag of chocolate sweets</i>

303
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:20,280
<i>was an unequivocal
provocation of this man.</i>

304
00:30:20,321 --> 00:30:23,024
<i>Excellent. An induced take.</i>

305
00:30:23,387 --> 00:30:25,332
<i>When all other attempts fail,</i>

306
00:30:25,395 --> 00:30:29,526
<i>a dramatic provocation can get an otherwise
completely passive fish to bite.</i>

307
00:30:29,565 --> 00:30:33,378
<i>They will react instinctively
to the right provocation,</i>

308
00:30:33,745 --> 00:30:39,362
<i>which would not be a fly, but, for instance,
a brightly-coloured wobbler, preferably red.</i>

309
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,104
<i>The very best is one we
call "the Finnish Weapon,"</i>

310
00:30:42,615 --> 00:30:45,516
<i>the so-called rapala.</i>

311
00:30:47,326 --> 00:30:49,759
<i>You've bought a gift.</i>

312
00:30:51,295 --> 00:30:52,964
Yes.

313
00:30:53,737 --> 00:30:56,405
- It's for my wife.
- Oh.

314
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:02,024
You travel first-class
and even bought us our tickets.

315
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:06,512
Why then not buy a decent
gift for your wife?

316
00:31:06,778 --> 00:31:10,044
I can see it comes
from the station.

317
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:19,191
Of course, I should have...
bought her something...

318
00:31:19,761 --> 00:31:22,126
Something better, but...

319
00:31:22,417 --> 00:31:25,730
Let's just say I was suddenly
in a hurry to get home.

320
00:31:26,212 --> 00:31:29,550
Why would a man like you

321
00:31:29,567 --> 00:31:32,867
with such an orderly life
suddenly have to hurry?

322
00:31:36,507 --> 00:31:38,776
It has to do with family.

323
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:43,499
My wife and I have
decided that we...

324
00:31:46,451 --> 00:31:49,404
We miss having children after all,

325
00:31:49,463 --> 00:31:52,464
and that if we are to have
children, it has to be now.

326
00:31:54,625 --> 00:31:58,230
So my wife called yesterday
to say that she...

327
00:31:58,387 --> 00:32:00,954
<i>She started ovulating.</i>

328
00:32:02,121 --> 00:32:07,012
<i>And all signs point to maximum
fertility precisely tonight.</i>

329
00:32:07,082 --> 00:32:09,273
You see...

330
00:32:09,274 --> 00:32:11,928
That's why I bought her
a gift at the station.

331
00:32:11,959 --> 00:32:15,094
I had to get a ticket home
as quickly as possible.

332
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:18,826
Well, I understand now.

333
00:32:19,753 --> 00:32:21,156
What is it you understand?

334
00:32:21,588 --> 00:32:24,487
Why you didn't have sex with us.

335
00:32:27,558 --> 00:32:30,995
It wasn't because I didn't want to.

336
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:49,675
Please.

337
00:32:53,349 --> 00:32:55,985
I'm begging you, please don't.

338
00:32:56,481 --> 00:32:58,131
It's okay.

339
00:32:59,358 --> 00:33:01,092
Please don't.

340
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:05,383
You've been as horny as hell...

341
00:33:06,293 --> 00:33:08,494
But you wouldn't give up your load.

342
00:33:08,983 --> 00:33:11,016
Please stop.

343
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:38,279
Oh God.

344
00:33:39,287 --> 00:33:40,654
Oh God.

345
00:33:58,417 --> 00:34:00,116
Wow.

346
00:34:12,531 --> 00:34:14,565
So oral sex

347
00:34:14,808 --> 00:34:17,411
became, in the eye of the angler, your...

348
00:34:17,724 --> 00:34:19,444
<i>your Finnish weapon.</i>

349
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:24,008
<i>Is that your only comment?</i>

350
00:34:25,103 --> 00:34:27,937
What else... what else
do you want me to say?

351
00:34:29,294 --> 00:34:32,065
That I behaved reprehensibly,

352
00:34:32,833 --> 00:34:36,288
that already my actions
exemplify that I'm a...

353
00:34:36,289 --> 00:34:38,656
I'm a terrible human being.

354
00:34:39,711 --> 00:34:41,594
That's not the way I see it.

355
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:43,726
On the contrary, I saw it as a...

356
00:34:43,962 --> 00:34:47,023
As a very pleasurable
and humorous story.

357
00:34:47,074 --> 00:34:50,809
I've consciously used
and hurt others...

358
00:34:51,502 --> 00:34:54,539
For the sake of my
own satisfaction.

359
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:57,509
And what I've told you so far
only begins to suggest that.

360
00:34:57,539 --> 00:34:59,073
But when you told the
story, you were...

361
00:34:59,105 --> 00:35:02,539
You were cheerful, full of humour.

362
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:05,045
The only thing you've done...

363
00:35:05,218 --> 00:35:09,087
Except giving a few people
an experience to remember is that you...

364
00:35:09,297 --> 00:35:12,088
You relieved S from his load

365
00:35:12,198 --> 00:35:15,599
in some... some youthful hubris.

366
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:21,784
And I read somewhere that if you keep
the load too long, the sperm will die.

367
00:35:21,851 --> 00:35:24,118
Or worse, degenerate.

368
00:35:25,292 --> 00:35:30,595
Maybe thanks to you, Mr. S and his wife now
have a healthy and well-functioning child.

369
00:35:31,728 --> 00:35:34,329
I discovered my power as woman

370
00:35:34,479 --> 00:35:37,616
and used it without any
concern for others.

371
00:35:37,837 --> 00:35:40,319
That's completely unacceptable.

372
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,841
Oh, little darling.

373
00:35:41,888 --> 00:35:43,755
Don't you "little darling" me.

374
00:35:46,403 --> 00:35:48,036
No.

375
00:35:50,433 --> 00:35:52,535
What I wanted to say was that

376
00:35:53,029 --> 00:35:55,966
if you have wings, why not fly?

377
00:36:29,074 --> 00:36:30,840
No more stories.

378
00:36:32,771 --> 00:36:34,605
You need to sleep.

379
00:36:35,129 --> 00:36:36,606
No no.

380
00:36:37,068 --> 00:36:39,336
This is beginning to amuse me.

381
00:36:45,951 --> 00:36:48,618
I don't even know your name.

382
00:36:49,488 --> 00:36:51,689
My name is Joe.

383
00:36:52,268 --> 00:36:53,868
I'm Seligman.

384
00:36:55,396 --> 00:36:58,544
What a fucking ridiculous name.

385
00:36:59,562 --> 00:37:01,794
It's Jewish.

386
00:37:02,147 --> 00:37:04,115
You said you weren't religious.

387
00:37:04,187 --> 00:37:06,454
No, but my great-grandfather was.

388
00:37:06,604 --> 00:37:10,409
And my parents gave me the name
as a sort of...

389
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:14,175
sentimental association to Judaism.

390
00:37:14,261 --> 00:37:17,914
But we've always been
anti-Zionists...

391
00:37:18,912 --> 00:37:22,349
Which is not the same
as being anti-Semitic,

392
00:37:22,678 --> 00:37:26,278
as certain political
powers try to convince us.

393
00:37:26,318 --> 00:37:28,355
Seligman...

394
00:37:28,777 --> 00:37:31,710
Means "the happy one".

395
00:37:34,736 --> 00:37:36,905
So are you happy then?

396
00:37:39,365 --> 00:37:41,665
Well, I suppose I am...

397
00:37:42,867 --> 00:37:44,633
In my own way.

398
00:37:45,407 --> 00:37:49,133
Even if I'm the kind of person who cut
the nails of the right hand first.

399
00:37:49,229 --> 00:37:50,560
What does that mean?

400
00:37:51,437 --> 00:37:53,639
Well, I divide humanity
into two groups:

401
00:37:53,703 --> 00:37:56,505
The people who cut the nails
on the left hand first

402
00:37:56,599 --> 00:38:00,226
and the people who cut the nails
of the right hand first.

403
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:03,597
My theory is that the people who cut the
nails of the left hand first,

404
00:38:03,613 --> 00:38:06,148
they... they... they're
more light-hearted.

405
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,517
They have a tendency
to enjoy life more

406
00:38:09,074 --> 00:38:12,537
because they go straight for
the easiest task and...

407
00:38:12,709 --> 00:38:16,277
Save their difficulties for later.

408
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,634
So what do you do?

409
00:38:23,227 --> 00:38:25,363
Always the left hand first.

410
00:38:25,442 --> 00:38:27,708
I don't think there's a choice.

411
00:38:28,594 --> 00:38:31,196
Go for the pleasure first, always.

412
00:38:31,963 --> 00:38:34,625
And then once you've
done the left hand,

413
00:38:34,626 --> 00:38:37,062
only the right hand remains,

414
00:38:37,063 --> 00:38:40,463
and that's the easiest one left.

415
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,316
I've never thought of it like that.

416
00:38:51,611 --> 00:38:54,514
Well, you... you're
never too old...

417
00:38:54,538 --> 00:38:56,237
Never too old to learn.

418
00:39:04,386 --> 00:39:05,921
That's Rugelach.

419
00:39:06,339 --> 00:39:09,238
Mm-hmm. It's a Jewish cake.

420
00:39:09,252 --> 00:39:11,021
There's that sentimentality again.

421
00:39:11,069 --> 00:39:13,002
No, but it's more than Rugelach.

422
00:39:13,105 --> 00:39:15,906
It's Rugelach served
with a cake fork.

423
00:39:17,768 --> 00:39:20,025
Rugelach, in my opinion, is pastry,

424
00:39:20,095 --> 00:39:23,330
which there is no excuse for
eating with a cake fork.

425
00:39:23,384 --> 00:39:27,361
To serve it with a cake fork
is irritatingly unmanly,

426
00:39:27,647 --> 00:39:30,447
not to say downright feminine.

427
00:39:32,183 --> 00:39:36,319
However it can bring us
further with the story.

428
00:39:37,563 --> 00:39:42,536
I also knew someone who
consumed Rugelach every day,

429
00:39:42,632 --> 00:39:45,634
almost ritually, with a cake fork.

430
00:39:45,932 --> 00:39:49,199
And although we'll be
jumping a bit in time...

431
00:39:50,485 --> 00:39:53,322
I have to tell you about Jerôme.

432
00:39:53,573 --> 00:39:56,450
As far as I can see, the
next chapter doesn't contain

433
00:39:56,497 --> 00:39:59,965
as direct an accusation
against my person as

434
00:40:00,208 --> 00:40:02,179
the rest of the story.

435
00:40:02,181 --> 00:40:06,782
The chapter will also make a
sentimental soul like you happy, as

436
00:40:06,829 --> 00:40:11,789
it contains observations
on the subject of love.

437
00:41:15,354 --> 00:41:17,688
Can I tell you something?

438
00:41:19,489 --> 00:41:20,590
Sure.

439
00:41:20,771 --> 00:41:22,638
Sure.

440
00:41:22,694 --> 00:41:23,385
Yeah.

441
00:41:23,454 --> 00:41:24,587
Yeah sure.

442
00:41:24,963 --> 00:41:26,263
It might not be important to you...

443
00:41:26,302 --> 00:41:27,502
...but it is to me.

444
00:41:27,605 --> 00:41:29,473
...but it is to me.

445
00:41:30,396 --> 00:41:33,136
I've never had an orgasm before.

446
00:41:36,374 --> 00:41:38,275
Really?

447
00:41:42,272 --> 00:41:44,574
You're my first one.

448
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,988
You don't know how
happy that makes me.

449
00:41:53,086 --> 00:41:55,558
I love you.

450
00:42:00,031 --> 00:42:02,399
You're my first.

451
00:42:05,836 --> 00:42:08,005
Well, I have to admit:

452
00:42:08,169 --> 00:42:10,737
Quite a lot of girls say that.

453
00:42:13,134 --> 00:42:16,180
<i>The train trip had
increased my appetite,</i>

454
00:42:16,273 --> 00:42:18,575
<i>and soon B and I started a club</i>

455
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:22,301
<i>that we called the little flock.</i>

456
00:42:22,317 --> 00:42:25,887
Mea vulva, mea maxima vulva.

457
00:42:26,225 --> 00:42:30,428
<i>B, of course, took the lead,
as she was the most daring of us.</i>

458
00:42:30,429 --> 00:42:32,137
<i>She was raised catholic.</i>

459
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:36,041
<i>I'm sure you're familiar with the
practices of the catholic church.</i>

460
00:42:36,213 --> 00:42:38,681
Mea maxima vulva.

461
00:42:38,737 --> 00:42:40,690
Mea vulva, mea...

462
00:42:40,718 --> 00:42:42,518
<i>That's interesting.</i>

463
00:42:43,111 --> 00:42:45,446
Blasphemic, satanic.

464
00:42:46,661 --> 00:42:47,796
The music...

465
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:50,314
The interval between B and F...

466
00:42:50,572 --> 00:42:54,252
It's a tritone,
the devil's interval.

467
00:42:54,253 --> 00:42:57,420
It was banned from music
in the middle ages.

468
00:42:58,486 --> 00:43:00,922
Well, the vacuum
cleaner invented it.

469
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,361
She took piano lessons.

470
00:43:03,526 --> 00:43:05,197
The vacuum cleaner?

471
00:43:05,213 --> 00:43:10,234
The vacuum cleaner possessed
a special talent for floppy cocks.

472
00:43:10,235 --> 00:43:13,436
She had some kind of
vacuum in her cunt.

473
00:43:13,506 --> 00:43:17,334
I... I was imagining
something like that.

474
00:43:17,397 --> 00:43:22,079
It was about fucking and about
having the right to be horny.

475
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:26,349
We masturbated together,
that kind of thing.

476
00:43:26,758 --> 00:43:28,825
But it was rebellious.

477
00:43:30,936 --> 00:43:32,838
We weren't allowed
to have boyfriends.

478
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:35,599
No fucking the same
guy more than once.

479
00:43:35,651 --> 00:43:37,719
What did you rebel against?

480
00:43:37,744 --> 00:43:39,409
Love.

481
00:43:40,485 --> 00:43:41,753
Love?

482
00:43:41,918 --> 00:43:46,736
We were committed to combat
the love-fixated society.

483
00:44:00,357 --> 00:44:05,323
<i>I really believed in our little flock,
but of course, that was naive of me.</i>

484
00:44:05,708 --> 00:44:10,778
<i>Over time, even the strongest
couldn't stay true to our manifest.</i>

485
00:44:10,916 --> 00:44:12,316
Third of the fifth.

486
00:44:12,498 --> 00:44:14,942
My third intercourse this week,

487
00:44:14,969 --> 00:44:17,403
- again with Alex.
- Third.

488
00:44:19,622 --> 00:44:22,457
Haven't we stated that
we fuck each guy once?

489
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:27,812
I don't think you can
understand Alex.

490
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,177
I don't want to.

491
00:44:29,241 --> 00:44:31,826
- Our relationship...
- Relationship?

492
00:44:32,084 --> 00:44:33,918
There you are.

493
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:38,587
Do you think you know
everything about sex?

494
00:44:42,193 --> 00:44:46,663
The secret ingredient
to sex... is love.

495
00:44:52,368 --> 00:44:56,639
For me, love was just
lust with jealousy added.

496
00:44:57,109 --> 00:45:00,311
Everything else was total nonsense.

497
00:45:00,312 --> 00:45:04,733
For every hundred crimes
committed in the name of love,

498
00:45:04,796 --> 00:45:08,098
only one is committed
in the name of sex.

499
00:45:08,718 --> 00:45:10,240
That's quite a statement.

500
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:15,458
Well, it all strengthened my wish
for a serious education.

501
00:45:27,494 --> 00:45:29,193
Glasgow.

502
00:45:33,244 --> 00:45:34,743
Aberdeen.

503
00:45:36,027 --> 00:45:37,662
Why are you smiling?

504
00:45:38,116 --> 00:45:44,321
Oh, I just pictured how an education
would be conveyed in your storytelling.

505
00:45:44,874 --> 00:45:46,810
Well, that's nothing
to smile about.

506
00:45:47,631 --> 00:45:49,726
I understand that.

507
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:53,410
So what kind of
education did you get?

508
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:57,602
I began studying
medicine like my father.

509
00:45:57,603 --> 00:46:00,548
<i>But it was harder and harder
for me to concentrate,</i>

510
00:46:00,588 --> 00:46:05,224
<i>so I studied less and less
till finally I dropped out.</i>

511
00:46:07,244 --> 00:46:10,178
So instead I began
to look for a job.

512
00:46:12,382 --> 00:46:16,997
<i>It turned out it was hard to get a
job that paid even halfway decently.</i>

513
00:46:18,446 --> 00:46:20,615
<i>I didn't really know
how to do anything,</i>

514
00:46:21,758 --> 00:46:24,657
<i>so I didn't have high hopes
when I applied for a position</i>

515
00:46:24,685 --> 00:46:27,086
<i>as an assistant at
a printing house.</i>

516
00:46:28,196 --> 00:46:33,971
So could you tell me a little
bit more about your background?

517
00:46:34,448 --> 00:46:37,831
- Um...
- Education-wise.

518
00:46:37,932 --> 00:46:41,345
Oh. Well, I finished high school

519
00:46:41,776 --> 00:46:45,215
and decided to study medicine...

520
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,836
But I didn't finish.

521
00:46:48,001 --> 00:46:50,381
I know it sounds a bit
pointless coming here.

522
00:46:50,418 --> 00:46:53,061
- Right.
- I just really need a job

523
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:54,787
and I've tried everywhere.

524
00:46:54,834 --> 00:46:59,430
I don't usually give jobs to people
just because they need one.

525
00:47:00,044 --> 00:47:02,841
What about secretarial skills?

526
00:47:02,905 --> 00:47:07,642
- Do you have any of those?
- No, I didn't think you needed skills.

527
00:47:08,994 --> 00:47:13,307
You didn't think you needed skills
for this position as a secretary?

528
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,948
No.

529
00:47:15,009 --> 00:47:16,643
Can you open an envelope?

530
00:47:17,487 --> 00:47:20,283
Yeah, I... yes, I think
I can open an envelope.

531
00:47:20,307 --> 00:47:22,909
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

532
00:47:23,729 --> 00:47:29,291
I shall discuss this conversation
with Mr. Jerôme, my boss.

533
00:47:30,694 --> 00:47:34,296
Do you think there's a chance?

534
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:36,400
I doubt it.

535
00:47:36,663 --> 00:47:38,261
Oh.

536
00:47:57,555 --> 00:48:00,223
Well, apparently

537
00:48:00,224 --> 00:48:02,760
having absolutely no experience

538
00:48:02,906 --> 00:48:04,996
is absolutely fine for this job.

539
00:48:04,997 --> 00:48:07,164
You've got it.

540
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:09,259
Oh.

541
00:48:09,279 --> 00:48:11,815
Does that mean
I should start tomorrow?

542
00:48:12,137 --> 00:48:14,571
Yeah, I suppose it does.

543
00:48:16,077 --> 00:48:18,907
- Good morning.
- Right.

544
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:28,112
Yes?

545
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:32,497
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

546
00:48:32,524 --> 00:48:36,002
I just wanted to introduce you
to our new junior secretary. Joe?

547
00:48:36,072 --> 00:48:38,073
I believe you wanted to
explain her work duties.

548
00:48:38,152 --> 00:48:39,924
- Hi.
- This is the new junior secretary, sir.

549
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,293
Liz, can I have another coffee?

550
00:48:41,466 --> 00:48:43,667
- Yes, of course, sir.
- Thank you.

551
00:48:46,194 --> 00:48:47,694
Hi.

552
00:48:51,215 --> 00:48:52,715
Jerôme?

553
00:48:53,343 --> 00:48:55,412
Your first love.

554
00:49:00,173 --> 00:49:02,677
I bet you didn't think I'd make
something of myself, right?

555
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:04,789
And now here I sit,

556
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:08,023
the director's chair of M&J Morris Ltd.

557
00:49:10,749 --> 00:49:12,284
Yes, quite surprising.

558
00:49:12,308 --> 00:49:13,942
Surprising?

559
00:49:14,108 --> 00:49:16,208
It's a sign from God.

560
00:49:20,316 --> 00:49:22,618
You know, I've thought about
you often since then.

561
00:49:23,968 --> 00:49:25,534
Have you thought of me?

562
00:49:28,505 --> 00:49:31,241
- Well...
- Ah.

563
00:49:31,492 --> 00:49:33,383
Usually, you know,
my uncle sits here.

564
00:49:33,406 --> 00:49:34,226
Mm-hmm.

565
00:49:34,243 --> 00:49:37,773
But he's developed a bit of a tummy problem,
so he's at the spa, taking long baths,

566
00:49:37,855 --> 00:49:39,554
drinking lots of water. Poor guy.

567
00:49:39,641 --> 00:49:41,093
And no one knows for how long,

568
00:49:41,134 --> 00:49:44,269
so now I'm the J in M&J Morris Ltd.

569
00:49:44,882 --> 00:49:46,398
How about that?

570
00:49:46,449 --> 00:49:50,015
We print cards and envelopes
and nonsense like that.

571
00:49:50,021 --> 00:49:52,135
It's a bloody complicated
business, you know.

572
00:49:52,198 --> 00:49:53,732
I don't understand a word of it.

573
00:49:54,815 --> 00:49:57,319
Come on, I'll show you around. Yes?

574
00:49:57,702 --> 00:49:58,971
- Liz?
- Yes sir?

575
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:01,222
Oh, look, there you are. Good job.

576
00:50:01,317 --> 00:50:03,786
Every time you do a good job,
I say, "Good job, Liz."

577
00:50:03,826 --> 00:50:05,361
- Thank you, sir.
- What's her name?

578
00:50:05,417 --> 00:50:07,285
- Liz.
- "Good job, Liz."

579
00:50:07,308 --> 00:50:09,277
- Good job, Liz.
- Good job, Liz!

580
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:11,488
This is Bobby. Bobby,
say hello. This is Joe.

581
00:50:11,499 --> 00:50:14,233
- Hello.
- He does the business cards.

582
00:50:28,267 --> 00:50:29,734
It stopped.

583
00:50:30,056 --> 00:50:32,096
Fuck.

584
00:50:34,903 --> 00:50:36,238
Yes.

585
00:50:37,648 --> 00:50:39,351
Well, isn't there an alarm?

586
00:50:39,399 --> 00:50:41,100
To which?

587
00:50:41,124 --> 00:50:43,609
- Isn't there an alarm?
- Alarm, all right, yes.

588
00:50:43,671 --> 00:50:47,039
- Good thinking.
- I'll press this.

589
00:50:49,585 --> 00:50:51,487
Imagine...

590
00:50:51,762 --> 00:50:54,465
You look just as great
all these years later.

591
00:50:54,653 --> 00:50:56,620
Oh no.

592
00:51:00,645 --> 00:51:01,645
No.

593
00:51:01,713 --> 00:51:03,346
No?

594
00:51:04,642 --> 00:51:06,246
- Wha...?
- No, Jerôme, this won't work.

595
00:51:06,299 --> 00:51:09,333
- Which won't work?
- This.

596
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:12,964
Why not?

597
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:15,469
You're not really my type.

598
00:51:17,715 --> 00:51:19,617
That's how it's gonna be?

599
00:51:19,790 --> 00:51:22,625
- Yes.
- All right.

600
00:51:28,528 --> 00:51:30,162
Fuck's sake.

601
00:51:39,473 --> 00:51:41,342
Okay.

602
00:51:50,839 --> 00:51:53,373
<i>- Umm...</i>
- Give me your hand.

603
00:51:54,859 --> 00:51:56,992
In a fireman's grip.

604
00:51:57,601 --> 00:51:58,323
Ooh!

605
00:51:58,373 --> 00:52:00,139
- You okay?
- Yeah.

606
00:52:03,259 --> 00:52:05,567
Why didn't you have sex with him?

607
00:52:05,899 --> 00:52:07,234
I'm not quite sure.

608
00:52:07,798 --> 00:52:10,308
I've shagged lots of idiots.

609
00:52:10,684 --> 00:52:12,434
I suppose he fired you then.

610
00:52:12,505 --> 00:52:16,578
No. If he had fired me,
then he would've lost.

611
00:52:19,410 --> 00:52:22,880
<i>As I didn't recall anyone
having defined my work duties,</i>

612
00:52:22,898 --> 00:52:26,765
<i>I decided to clean up in
order to smooth the waters.</i>

613
00:52:34,899 --> 00:52:36,969
- Good morning, Mister.
- Any calls?

614
00:52:36,998 --> 00:52:38,498
No sir.

615
00:52:44,459 --> 00:52:45,793
What have you done?

616
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:48,716
Oh. I cleaned up.

617
00:52:48,751 --> 00:52:50,285
You cleaned up?

618
00:52:50,481 --> 00:52:52,584
It... it was quite messy and...

619
00:52:52,615 --> 00:52:54,618
- Liz?
- Yes sir?

620
00:52:54,912 --> 00:52:56,679
She cleaned up.

621
00:52:57,458 --> 00:52:59,888
I know... I didn't know, sir.
I was away from my desk.

622
00:52:59,904 --> 00:53:02,025
Are you completely mad?

623
00:53:08,095 --> 00:53:10,197
What is the tea and
pastry doing here?

624
00:53:10,535 --> 00:53:11,915
I thought that's what you
wanted for breakfast.

625
00:53:11,962 --> 00:53:13,602
You thought? Mmm!

626
00:53:13,634 --> 00:53:15,102
You're not supposed to think.

627
00:53:15,165 --> 00:53:16,313
I don't pay you to think, do I?

628
00:53:16,327 --> 00:53:17,493
This is a do-over.

629
00:53:17,722 --> 00:53:19,072
- A do-over?
- Right.

630
00:53:19,104 --> 00:53:23,580
Pick it up, take it outside,
and do it again.

631
00:53:35,592 --> 00:53:37,094
One moment.

632
00:53:45,603 --> 00:53:47,903
Come in.

633
00:53:49,649 --> 00:53:51,774
Would now be a good time
for some tea and cake?

634
00:53:51,803 --> 00:53:53,502
Sure, why not.

635
00:53:56,019 --> 00:53:57,558
Where the fuck is my cake fork?

636
00:53:57,590 --> 00:53:58,757
Cake fork?

637
00:53:58,789 --> 00:54:00,491
- Right.
- Well...

638
00:54:00,789 --> 00:54:04,821
I would've got you one,
but it just... feels inappropriate.

639
00:54:21,962 --> 00:54:23,978
Unmanly.

640
00:54:24,024 --> 00:54:25,323
Feminine.

641
00:54:26,384 --> 00:54:29,298
On the other hand,
you must say that a cake fork is...

642
00:54:29,405 --> 00:54:31,772
Is a rather practical tool.

643
00:54:33,465 --> 00:54:37,302
It's like a cross between
a knife and a fork.

644
00:54:37,389 --> 00:54:41,091
The point is that you're supposed to be
able to hold the cake dish with one hand,

645
00:54:41,092 --> 00:54:43,258
and then cut it with the other...

646
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:47,305
And then eat it with the fork.

647
00:54:47,541 --> 00:54:50,241
It's not feminine.
It's at least bourgeois.

648
00:54:51,016 --> 00:54:53,453
It's said that the...
The Bolsheviks

649
00:54:53,614 --> 00:54:55,619
<i>during their rampage
through Russia,</i>

650
00:54:55,730 --> 00:54:58,159
<i>to separate the men from the boys,
or rather the...</i>

651
00:54:58,362 --> 00:55:01,928
<i>The bourgeoisie from the
proletariat, they brought a boy,</i>

652
00:55:01,983 --> 00:55:03,511
<i>and before burning down a house</i>

653
00:55:03,521 --> 00:55:07,324
<i>they sent him in to make
sure they had cake forks.</i>

654
00:55:11,789 --> 00:55:13,956
That's not true.

655
00:55:17,093 --> 00:55:19,663
I don't have the story first-hand.

656
00:55:19,664 --> 00:55:22,835
- Hello.
- Hi.

657
00:55:22,885 --> 00:55:26,155
Hi, I was wondering
if you could help me.

658
00:55:26,196 --> 00:55:28,463
It's suddenly gone very dirty.

659
00:55:30,513 --> 00:55:33,115
See, you put your dirty
fingers on there.

660
00:55:33,171 --> 00:55:35,138
Maybe we should wash your hands.

661
00:55:35,194 --> 00:55:36,961
Yeah, better.

662
00:55:39,111 --> 00:55:40,590
Mm-hmm.

663
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:42,556
You must be very talented.

664
00:55:42,595 --> 00:55:44,729
- Yeah sure.
- Mmm.

665
00:55:52,796 --> 00:55:56,870
<i>If you had asked Jerôme, he would've said
that I was the one who had declared war.</i>

666
00:55:59,170 --> 00:56:01,340
<i>Many times he'd take me into town,</i>

667
00:56:01,645 --> 00:56:04,513
<i>just so I could hold his coat.</i>

668
00:56:04,609 --> 00:56:06,576
- There.
- Where?

669
00:56:06,577 --> 00:56:09,244
There, behind the green car.

670
00:56:11,181 --> 00:56:12,100
It's not big enough.

671
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:14,141
It is, there's plenty of space.

672
00:56:15,694 --> 00:56:17,834
I saw it.
It's not enough space.

673
00:56:17,904 --> 00:56:20,205
I'm telling you there's
plenty of space.

674
00:56:26,936 --> 00:56:28,302
No.

675
00:56:32,039 --> 00:56:33,908
Can I try?

676
00:56:35,156 --> 00:56:36,941
Can you try?

677
00:56:37,121 --> 00:56:38,387
I'm a wizard at this.

678
00:56:38,457 --> 00:56:40,067
I just tried it. There's
not enough space, Joe.

679
00:56:40,099 --> 00:56:42,234
You just saw me do it.
There's not enough space.

680
00:56:42,282 --> 00:56:43,481
Okay?

681
00:56:43,513 --> 00:56:46,481
- Can I try?
- You wanna try?

682
00:56:48,927 --> 00:56:50,862
Why not?

683
00:57:37,948 --> 00:57:39,455
<i>It was about this time</i>

684
00:57:39,488 --> 00:57:43,656
<i>that a dramatic change
happened inside of me.</i>

685
00:57:45,213 --> 00:57:47,065
<i>I could suddenly see</i>

686
00:57:47,075 --> 00:57:50,209
<i>a kind of order in the mess.</i>

687
00:57:50,679 --> 00:57:53,247
It was all very very wrong.

688
00:57:54,099 --> 00:57:56,668
I wanted to be one
of Jerôme's things.

689
00:57:57,241 --> 00:57:59,796
I wanted to be picked up

690
00:57:59,908 --> 00:58:03,224
and put down again and again.

691
00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:05,744
<i>I wanted to be treated
by his hands,</i>

692
00:58:06,201 --> 00:58:11,810
according to some sophisticated
principle that I didn't understand.

693
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:13,628
His strong hands?

694
00:58:14,005 --> 00:58:17,645
Yes, but now it was
no longer just about his hands.

695
00:58:17,714 --> 00:58:21,116
It's as if everything
about him was different,

696
00:58:21,590 --> 00:58:24,785
which of course it wasn't,
and I knew that in my head.

697
00:58:24,851 --> 00:58:28,982
And I scolded myself for seeing him
in this new light.

698
00:58:29,616 --> 00:58:31,550
Love is blind.

699
00:58:31,989 --> 00:58:34,323
No no no, it's worse.

700
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:37,213
Love distorts things.

701
00:58:37,370 --> 00:58:42,703
Or even worse, love is something
you've never asked for.

702
00:58:43,391 --> 00:58:48,004
The erotic was something I asked
for, or even demanded of men.

703
00:58:48,005 --> 00:58:50,973
But this idiotic love...

704
00:58:52,218 --> 00:58:54,753
I felt humiliated by it...

705
00:58:55,451 --> 00:58:58,086
And all the dishonesty
that follows.

706
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:03,062
The erotic is about saying yes.

707
00:59:04,589 --> 00:59:07,492
Love appeals to the
lowest instincts,

708
00:59:07,821 --> 00:59:10,155
wrapped up in lies.

709
00:59:10,228 --> 00:59:15,130
How do you say yes when you
mean no, and vice versa?

710
00:59:18,219 --> 00:59:21,089
I'm ashamed of what I became,

711
00:59:21,434 --> 00:59:24,268
but it was beyond my control.

712
00:59:25,524 --> 00:59:27,658
You know what you're doing now?

713
00:59:28,349 --> 00:59:30,185
No, what am I doing?

714
00:59:30,327 --> 00:59:32,994
You're defending your personality.

715
00:59:33,284 --> 00:59:36,486
I thought the point
was to reveal it.

716
00:59:42,317 --> 00:59:45,302
<i>At this time I took
up walking again.</i>

717
00:59:45,372 --> 00:59:47,405
<i>I walked in the forest.</i>

718
00:59:52,302 --> 00:59:55,004
<i>The forest of my childhood.</i>

719
00:59:56,140 --> 01:00:00,042
<i>I took the same walk
again and again.</i>

720
01:00:00,749 --> 01:00:03,686
<i>Right turn after the gatehouse,</i>

721
01:00:03,882 --> 01:00:06,498
<i>and right again by the ash tree,</i>

722
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:09,431
<i>which has the most beautiful
leaves in the forest.</i>

723
01:00:10,635 --> 01:00:14,339
<i>And further on past the
lady with her poodle</i>

724
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:17,109
<i>and the old man on the bench.</i>

725
01:00:24,434 --> 01:00:26,152
<i>I couldn't free myself</i>

726
01:00:26,194 --> 01:00:30,163
<i>of the image of Jerôme and
his careless elegance.</i>

727
01:00:37,371 --> 01:00:40,374
<i>And during this time, when
I was with other men,</i>

728
01:00:40,625 --> 01:00:44,561
<i>I forbade them to touch
my body with their hands.</i>

729
01:00:47,326 --> 01:00:51,862
<i>And soon I stopped
having sex altogether.</i>

730
01:00:53,347 --> 01:00:56,272
<i>I tried to meet him all the time.</i>

731
01:00:56,313 --> 01:00:59,015
<i>I found out where he lived,</i>

732
01:00:59,470 --> 01:01:02,638
<i>but of course never dared
ring his doorbell.</i>

733
01:01:05,089 --> 01:01:07,876
<i>I worked for a long
time on a letter</i>

734
01:01:07,945 --> 01:01:11,480
<i>in which I told him about
my feelings for him.</i>

735
01:01:12,117 --> 01:01:13,446
<i>A month would pass</i>

736
01:01:13,502 --> 01:01:16,032
<i>before I had built
up enough courage</i>

737
01:01:16,247 --> 01:01:18,647
<i>to deliver it.</i>

738
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:31,283
I'm sorry. Isn't this
Jerôme's office?

739
01:01:32,153 --> 01:01:37,941
I'm happy to say that this never has
been and never will be Jerôme's office.

740
01:01:37,942 --> 01:01:42,545
But my nephew has been standing
in for me while I've been unwell.

741
01:01:42,961 --> 01:01:46,696
Was that a letter for him?

742
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:47,375
Yes.

743
01:01:47,409 --> 01:01:50,765
Give it to me and I will
make sure he gets it.

744
01:01:55,231 --> 01:01:57,293
I can't promise when that might be,

745
01:01:57,384 --> 01:02:00,090
as he's long gone.

746
01:02:00,582 --> 01:02:06,968
How the young finance their irrepressible
desire for travel is a mystery to me.

747
01:02:06,971 --> 01:02:08,302
So he's gone?

748
01:02:08,325 --> 01:02:10,158
Deserted us, yes.

749
01:02:11,317 --> 01:02:13,651
Raving about a trip
around the world

750
01:02:13,683 --> 01:02:16,020
- and married and all.
- Married?

751
01:02:16,728 --> 01:02:18,348
Married, yes.

752
01:02:19,114 --> 01:02:21,817
Flown the coop with my secretary.

753
01:02:22,276 --> 01:02:23,743
Liz.

754
01:02:31,387 --> 01:02:33,296
And your job?

755
01:02:33,473 --> 01:02:36,606
It turned out that
Jerôme's uncle demanded

756
01:02:36,657 --> 01:02:39,025
a bit more knowledge about
the business, so...

757
01:02:39,244 --> 01:02:41,643
That was the end of love then?

758
01:02:43,293 --> 01:02:46,363
Well, maybe it's not
quite as simple.

759
01:02:47,473 --> 01:02:50,770
But more about that later,

760
01:02:50,811 --> 01:02:52,811
as they say in the novels.

761
01:02:52,884 --> 01:02:56,253
And Jerôme just disappeared?

762
01:02:56,254 --> 01:02:59,256
Yes, though I tried to keep him,

763
01:02:59,257 --> 01:03:01,992
in my own way, mentally,

764
01:03:01,993 --> 01:03:05,894
as I masturbated on the
train amongst other people.

765
01:03:07,664 --> 01:03:08,984
You masturbated on the train?

766
01:03:09,032 --> 01:03:11,265
- On the seat?
- Yes, of course.

767
01:03:17,239 --> 01:03:19,544
<i>I did a jigsaw puzzle.</i>

768
01:03:19,575 --> 01:03:21,108
<i>A jigsaw puzzle?</i>

769
01:03:25,750 --> 01:03:28,637
<i>I found details in
the other passengers</i>

770
01:03:28,787 --> 01:03:31,554
<i>that reminded me of Jerôme.</i>

771
01:04:11,892 --> 01:04:13,524
<i>But in the long run,</i>

772
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:15,848
<i>I couldn't hold on to
the details of him,</i>

773
01:04:16,045 --> 01:04:18,278
<i>no matter how hard I tried.</i>

774
01:04:19,362 --> 01:04:21,594
Maybe that's how it is with memory. You...

775
01:04:21,665 --> 01:04:24,641
You remember silhouettes,

776
01:04:24,649 --> 01:04:26,461
the essentials.

777
01:04:26,527 --> 01:04:30,230
But that's not
necessarily a bad thing.

778
01:04:32,149 --> 01:04:34,384
<i>Of course, as silhouettes
in the winter,</i>

779
01:04:34,673 --> 01:04:38,148
- <i>the trees are difficult to tell apart.</i>
- See these buds?

780
01:04:38,251 --> 01:04:43,481
<i>My father wrestled courageously with
his flora and tree type guides.</i>

781
01:04:45,116 --> 01:04:46,816
It's actually...

782
01:04:48,393 --> 01:04:52,565
The souls of the trees
we see in the winter.

783
01:04:52,590 --> 01:04:56,718
In the summer, everything is green
and idyllic, but in the winter,

784
01:04:56,750 --> 01:04:59,752
the branches and the trunks,
they all stand out.

785
01:04:59,792 --> 01:05:01,624
Just look at how
crooked they all are.

786
01:05:03,626 --> 01:05:07,416
<i>The branches have to carry all
of the leaves into the sunlight.</i>

787
01:05:08,210 --> 01:05:11,145
<i>It's one long struggle
for survival.</i>

788
01:05:14,417 --> 01:05:20,463
<i>My father surprised me by calling the
naked trunks the souls of the trees.</i>

789
01:05:20,464 --> 01:05:23,233
<i>A poetic thought that
was rare for him,</i>

790
01:05:23,562 --> 01:05:27,935
<i>as by his own account he preferred
the empirical sciences.</i>

791
01:05:30,703 --> 01:05:32,872
<i>And after Jerôme?</i>

792
01:05:33,311 --> 01:05:35,711
I reacted...

793
01:05:36,214 --> 01:05:38,344
Well, let's just say,

794
01:05:38,820 --> 01:05:40,250
aggressively.

795
01:05:40,704 --> 01:05:41,836
How?

796
01:05:42,885 --> 01:05:46,219
By intensifying my hunt for men.

797
01:05:48,022 --> 01:05:49,763
<i>You know these supermarket doors</i>

798
01:05:49,812 --> 01:05:53,281
<i>that open and close by way
of some kind of sensor?</i>

799
01:05:54,037 --> 01:05:56,832
<i>Now compare these doors to my cunt</i>

800
01:05:56,833 --> 01:06:00,935
<i>and add an extraordinarily
sensitive sensor.</i>

801
01:06:02,487 --> 01:06:04,643
<i>My sensitive door opening</i>

802
01:06:04,692 --> 01:06:08,986
<i>gave me an opportunity to develop
my morphological studies</i>

803
01:06:09,074 --> 01:06:11,406
<i>from leaves to genitals.</i>

804
01:06:16,035 --> 01:06:18,074
<i>I embarked on a trip through</i>

805
01:06:18,141 --> 01:06:20,676
<i>what, in the lingo
of children's books,</i>

806
01:06:20,755 --> 01:06:25,057
<i>one might call the country
of the big black cocks...</i>

807
01:06:27,451 --> 01:06:32,021
<i>The country of the small
yellow cocks, and so on.</i>

808
01:06:32,051 --> 01:06:37,285
<i>And most of all, I battled my way through
an untold number of circumcised cocks.</i>

809
01:06:39,468 --> 01:06:41,889
<i>By the way, did you know
that if you combine</i>

810
01:06:41,922 --> 01:06:44,425
<i>all the foreskin cut
off through history</i>

811
01:06:44,482 --> 01:06:47,683
it would reach to
Mars and back again?

812
01:07:07,954 --> 01:07:09,822
Mrs. H.

813
01:07:24,772 --> 01:07:28,319
<i>By now I had built up a
sizeable circle of men...</i>

814
01:07:28,615 --> 01:07:31,740
<i>And was starting to have trouble
remembering who was who.</i>

815
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:33,725
<i>Hello, sweetheart. Want to meet?</i>

816
01:07:34,625 --> 01:07:35,459
<i>It's fisher.</i>

817
01:07:35,544 --> 01:07:38,613
<i>I'm lying here, thinking
of you and what you said.</i>

818
01:07:38,661 --> 01:07:40,662
<i>I'm not angry at all if
that's what you think.</i>

819
01:07:41,406 --> 01:07:43,265
<i>Hi, Joe, it's rob again.</i>

820
01:07:43,334 --> 01:07:45,268
<i>I had a really good
time seeing you.</i>

821
01:07:45,308 --> 01:07:47,187
<i>Give me... Give me a call.</i>

822
01:07:47,252 --> 01:07:50,387
<i>Hi, Joe, I left a
couple of messages.</i>

823
01:07:50,419 --> 01:07:52,705
<i>- Is everything all right?
- I quickly gave up</i>

824
01:07:52,745 --> 01:07:55,882
<i>trying to remember the
individual relationships.</i>

825
01:07:56,721 --> 01:07:58,424
<i>It was impossible,</i>

826
01:07:58,513 --> 01:08:02,148
<i>and impossible to predict
what they wanted to hear.</i>

827
01:08:03,073 --> 01:08:05,608
<i>So I invented a method.</i>

828
01:08:08,761 --> 01:08:11,229
<i>It was all based on chance.</i>

829
01:08:14,373 --> 01:08:17,941
<i>A one meant an overly
loving answer.</i>

830
01:08:21,055 --> 01:08:24,961
<i>A two, not quite as passionate
but still positive.</i>

831
01:08:24,981 --> 01:08:28,221
<i>And so on up to five,
which was a complete rejection.</i>

832
01:08:28,653 --> 01:08:31,520
<i>And six, no answer at all.</i>

833
01:08:40,388 --> 01:08:42,122
Hey, Eddie, it's me.

834
01:08:42,481 --> 01:08:46,669
Listen, I've given it a lot of thought and
I've come to the conclusion that we're done.

835
01:08:46,722 --> 01:08:48,289
Bye.

836
01:08:48,517 --> 01:08:49,954
<i>The trick with this method</i>

837
01:08:49,976 --> 01:08:53,946
<i>was that I didn't have to worry about
the individual relationships...</i>

838
01:08:54,010 --> 01:08:56,423
Hi, Patrick, it's Joe.

839
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:59,307
<i>...but instead became
completely unpredictable,</i>

840
01:08:59,417 --> 01:09:02,718
<i>which of course drove
the men even wilder.</i>

841
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:05,291
You're quite annoying,

842
01:09:05,683 --> 01:09:08,159
so I don't want to see you anymore.

843
01:09:08,194 --> 01:09:09,760
Please don't call back.

844
01:09:10,433 --> 01:09:12,488
<i>That sounds rather stressful.</i>

845
01:09:12,635 --> 01:09:14,771
<i>Yes, actually it was.</i>

846
01:09:14,999 --> 01:09:18,901
<i>But fortunately I had my
little book of comfort.</i>

847
01:09:20,555 --> 01:09:23,156
<i>When I needed comfort or peace,</i>

848
01:09:23,306 --> 01:09:25,642
<i>I took out my herbarium</i>

849
01:09:25,643 --> 01:09:28,445
<i>and looked at my favourite leaves...</i>

850
01:09:28,610 --> 01:09:33,345
<i>Ash, trembling Aspen and Lime.</i>

851
01:09:40,271 --> 01:09:43,974
<i>When you're dealing with a larger
group of lovers, as I was,</i>

852
01:09:44,327 --> 01:09:47,771
<i>there will typically be a
difference in their qualities.</i>

853
01:09:47,828 --> 01:09:50,594
<i>H was a sticky bastard.</i>

854
01:09:51,924 --> 01:09:54,401
You have to leave. I've
got guests for dinner.

855
01:09:54,428 --> 01:09:56,494
But he's not coming until 7:00.

856
01:09:57,019 --> 01:09:58,722
No.

857
01:09:59,052 --> 01:10:00,885
But 7:00 isn't that far away.

858
01:10:08,752 --> 01:10:10,752
Do you love me?

859
01:10:13,105 --> 01:10:15,689
<i>A was to arrive at 7:00,</i>

860
01:10:15,747 --> 01:10:18,180
<i>and I needed to get H out of there.</i>

861
01:10:21,343 --> 01:10:23,411
I love you too much.

862
01:10:24,477 --> 01:10:27,577
You keep promising,
but I understand now

863
01:10:27,604 --> 01:10:31,841
that you'll never leave
your family for my sake.

864
01:10:33,348 --> 01:10:35,384
It's sad, but...

865
01:10:36,995 --> 01:10:38,763
It's your choice.

866
01:10:39,928 --> 01:10:43,856
It's not satisfying for me
that I can't have you completely.

867
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:50,249
Which is why we can't see
each other any longer.

868
01:10:54,306 --> 01:10:56,073
Goodbye.

869
01:10:59,935 --> 01:11:02,070
Look, I...

870
01:11:06,188 --> 01:11:08,556
And have a nice life.

871
01:11:09,619 --> 01:11:11,620
Oh. Ugh. Wow.

872
01:11:34,333 --> 01:11:37,171
My darling, I'm yours.

873
01:11:38,062 --> 01:11:40,029
I've left her.

874
01:11:47,333 --> 01:11:50,028
- Has he gone inside?
- Yes.

875
01:11:51,590 --> 01:11:53,591
Is the door closed?

876
01:12:05,908 --> 01:12:07,924
- Uh, hello.
- Hello.

877
01:12:07,970 --> 01:12:09,069
Apologize.

878
01:12:09,671 --> 01:12:14,073
We... had promised not to come up.

879
01:12:14,901 --> 01:12:17,323
We just wanted to make sure

880
01:12:17,354 --> 01:12:21,657
he got here safely, now that
he's made the big decision.

881
01:12:22,874 --> 01:12:26,542
May the children see him inside?

882
01:12:43,285 --> 01:12:44,985
What a nice place.

883
01:12:46,247 --> 01:12:49,583
It's... so bohemian.

884
01:12:53,105 --> 01:12:55,442
Oh, that's right.

885
01:12:55,521 --> 01:12:58,322
- You need the car key.
- Uh, no, I don't need the car.

886
01:12:58,401 --> 01:13:00,168
Oh yes, you do.

887
01:13:00,490 --> 01:13:02,524
He likes the car.

888
01:13:02,939 --> 01:13:04,472
Here.

889
01:13:05,304 --> 01:13:07,124
- No, please. Just take it.
- I don't want it.

890
01:13:07,190 --> 01:13:09,230
- Just take it.
- I don't want the fucking car!

891
01:13:13,747 --> 01:13:14,983
It's all right.

892
01:13:15,585 --> 01:13:17,574
We'll get the bus home.

893
01:13:17,897 --> 01:13:21,543
The children might as well get used
to public transport now, right?

894
01:13:22,319 --> 01:13:26,515
Of course, their standard of living
won't be the same anymore, but...

895
01:13:30,545 --> 01:13:31,764
Hey.

896
01:13:33,811 --> 01:13:34,975
What's this?

897
01:13:35,225 --> 01:13:36,865
It's a present.

898
01:13:38,053 --> 01:13:41,496
A pillow he has
embroidered himself.

899
01:13:42,430 --> 01:13:44,598
- And who's it for?
- Daddy.

900
01:13:46,826 --> 01:13:50,974
I do hope it's all right if the children
call their father "daddy" here.

901
01:13:50,975 --> 01:13:55,130
If you prefer,
they can call him "him"

902
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:58,428
or simply "the man".

903
01:13:58,882 --> 01:14:01,311
To be honest, my first
thought was never ever

904
01:14:01,345 --> 01:14:05,389
to let either of you see the children,
but then I changed my mind.

905
01:14:05,420 --> 01:14:07,982
I thought it only right that
their father be confronted

906
01:14:08,011 --> 01:14:10,712
by the little people whose
lives he has destroyed.

907
01:14:12,290 --> 01:14:14,279
Give daddy your present.

908
01:14:18,145 --> 01:14:21,348
It's a car the little
dear has embroidered.

909
01:14:21,957 --> 01:14:25,174
I'm aware that not
everyone can see it, but

910
01:14:26,106 --> 01:14:28,711
but with the heart
one can see much,

911
01:14:28,712 --> 01:14:32,313
however unimportant that
information may be to you.

912
01:14:34,035 --> 01:14:38,286
Would it be all right if I showed
the children the whoring bed?

913
01:14:38,756 --> 01:14:43,225
After all, they also have
a stake in this event.

914
01:14:46,810 --> 01:14:49,193
You need to see it, right?

915
01:14:49,558 --> 01:14:52,310
Let's go see daddy's
favourite place.

916
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:55,179
Come on, boys.

917
01:14:56,466 --> 01:14:58,468
Oh!

918
01:15:01,796 --> 01:15:05,230
So this is where it all happened.

919
01:15:11,287 --> 01:15:14,623
You should try to
memorize this room,

920
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:16,825
especially the bed.

921
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:20,965
It'll stand you in good
stead later in therapy.

922
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:26,636
Here I sit, rambling on about therapy
without a thought of what it might cost.

923
01:15:26,973 --> 01:15:29,940
I do hope you don't think
we're here to beg.

924
01:15:33,165 --> 01:15:36,302
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

925
01:15:37,522 --> 01:15:40,381
I'm being silly.
Mommy's being silly.

926
01:15:40,952 --> 01:15:43,262
Let's have a cup of tea.

927
01:16:00,668 --> 01:16:03,910
The children's father likes
two lumps of sugar in his tea.

928
01:16:23,933 --> 01:16:24,935
- I'll get it.
- Hm-mmm.

929
01:16:24,956 --> 01:16:27,255
- No no no, please please please.
- Mmm.

930
01:16:29,116 --> 01:16:31,050
- Hello.
- Hello.

931
01:16:31,598 --> 01:16:33,123
- Yes?
- Uh...

932
01:16:33,384 --> 01:16:36,022
Oh, how nice! Lovely.

933
01:16:36,058 --> 01:16:39,194
- Boys. Come here.
- Is Joe here?

934
01:16:39,337 --> 01:16:41,403
This might be interesting.

935
01:16:42,821 --> 01:16:44,141
- This is my son.
- Yes.

936
01:16:44,212 --> 01:16:45,595
- Yes.
- Hello hello.

937
01:16:45,719 --> 01:16:47,446
Good boy. Look him in the eyes.

938
01:16:47,521 --> 01:16:48,788
I'm Andy. Hello.

939
01:16:48,836 --> 01:16:50,303
Friend of Joe's then?

940
01:16:50,335 --> 01:16:52,037
- Yeah.
- You known each other long?

941
01:16:52,156 --> 01:16:55,468
- Um, not that long, no.
- Not terribly long?

942
01:16:55,607 --> 01:16:57,073
- No.
- Oh.

943
01:17:04,973 --> 01:17:07,809
A ménage a trois.

944
01:17:09,146 --> 01:17:11,282
It's all so exotic.

945
01:17:11,353 --> 01:17:14,654
So... broad-minded.

946
01:17:16,038 --> 01:17:17,973
On that point...

947
01:17:18,754 --> 01:17:20,522
I failed.

948
01:17:20,710 --> 01:17:22,744
No doubt about it.

949
01:17:24,393 --> 01:17:28,130
Boys, now is the time to be alert

950
01:17:28,799 --> 01:17:33,127
and ask all the questions
your hearts desire,

951
01:17:33,536 --> 01:17:34,903
because...

952
01:17:36,092 --> 01:17:39,302
I hope that you shall
never have to encounter

953
01:17:39,330 --> 01:17:42,799
such people or be in such
a situation ever again.

954
01:17:44,743 --> 01:17:46,211
Well? Hmm?

955
01:17:46,276 --> 01:17:48,343
You don't have any questions?

956
01:17:49,178 --> 01:17:51,379
No?

957
01:17:52,810 --> 01:17:54,378
Well, I'll start, shall I?

958
01:17:55,976 --> 01:17:58,312
Approximately how many lives

959
01:17:58,516 --> 01:18:01,819
do you think she has time
to destroy in one day?

960
01:18:01,882 --> 01:18:03,630
Five?

961
01:18:03,713 --> 01:18:05,313
Fifty?

962
01:18:05,971 --> 01:18:07,805
Or several hundreds?

963
01:18:10,833 --> 01:18:14,836
Look, this is just a
big misunderstanding.

964
01:18:19,370 --> 01:18:20,903
Boys...

965
01:18:23,018 --> 01:18:26,922
- I don't...
- I don't love your father.

966
01:18:26,946 --> 01:18:29,110
She's just saying that
to make us feel better.

967
01:18:29,150 --> 01:18:32,172
I'm sure you understand that.

968
01:18:32,397 --> 01:18:34,264
Because if it were
a joke, I mean...

969
01:18:35,302 --> 01:18:38,096
If... this were really a joke,

970
01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:40,526
then it would be a joke so cruel.

971
01:18:45,627 --> 01:18:49,397
No one can be that cruel.

972
01:18:50,509 --> 01:18:58,054
To destroy a mesh of feelings woven over
20 years is no joke, I can assure you.

973
01:19:07,683 --> 01:19:09,590
Well...

974
01:19:10,321 --> 01:19:15,697
If three's a crowd, then seven must be a
bit of a challenge for the pretty miss.

975
01:19:18,236 --> 01:19:23,171
I must say I have a hard time
picturing her enjoying loneliness.

976
01:19:24,952 --> 01:19:28,222
I think we'd better grab
the chance to get away,

977
01:19:28,639 --> 01:19:31,311
before things become grotesque.

978
01:19:31,735 --> 01:19:33,318
Come on.

979
01:19:33,928 --> 01:19:37,146
- No, dad!
- No. No. No.

980
01:19:37,175 --> 01:19:38,732
Get back.

981
01:19:39,654 --> 01:19:43,089
You wouldn't want to give your father
a guilty conscience now, would you?

982
01:20:02,259 --> 01:20:04,727
So how did this episode
affect your life?

983
01:20:05,868 --> 01:20:07,569
Not at all.

984
01:20:09,289 --> 01:20:12,224
- Not at all?
- No.

985
01:20:13,254 --> 01:20:16,356
You can't make an omelet
without breaking a few eggs.

986
01:20:20,729 --> 01:20:22,696
Oh, that's true.

987
01:20:25,855 --> 01:20:27,322
Some people...

988
01:20:28,472 --> 01:20:29,637
blame the addict.

989
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:33,442
Other people feel
sorry for the addict.

990
01:20:33,443 --> 01:20:37,844
But I was an addict out
of lust, not out of need.

991
01:20:38,867 --> 01:20:40,669
You would say that, wouldn't you?

992
01:20:41,421 --> 01:20:44,859
And lust that led to
destruction around me,

993
01:20:44,893 --> 01:20:47,060
everywhere I went.

994
01:20:48,202 --> 01:20:52,606
Well, addiction
sometimes leads to an

995
01:20:52,818 --> 01:20:54,518
absence of empathy.

996
01:20:56,661 --> 01:21:01,436
You can't fight a lion and blow the noses
of your children at the same time.

997
01:21:03,074 --> 01:21:06,342
For me, nymphomania
was callousness.

998
01:21:09,519 --> 01:21:11,687
You're very stubborn.

999
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:14,634
But what about yourself?

1000
01:21:15,284 --> 01:21:17,719
How did you feel during all this?

1001
01:21:27,730 --> 01:21:29,465
Did you feel good,

1002
01:21:29,707 --> 01:21:31,707
or did you feel bad?

1003
01:21:38,326 --> 01:21:41,695
Mrs. H was right about
the loneliness.

1004
01:21:42,297 --> 01:21:46,079
I'd be lying if I said it hadn't
been my constant companion.

1005
01:21:49,383 --> 01:21:54,117
So you were with all these men
and you still felt alone?

1006
01:22:00,402 --> 01:22:03,237
I didn't want to
tell you about it,

1007
01:22:04,507 --> 01:22:06,943
but you've led me into a trap.

1008
01:22:10,406 --> 01:22:12,974
It was a certain feeling.

1009
01:22:17,777 --> 01:22:21,980
Oh, how awful that everything
has to be so trivial.

1010
01:22:31,579 --> 01:22:34,530
<i>When I was seven,
I had to have an operation.</i>

1011
01:22:34,531 --> 01:22:38,965
<i>Nothing serious, but it
did require anaesthesia.</i>

1012
01:22:40,089 --> 01:22:42,525
<i>I had already been pre-medicated</i>

1013
01:22:42,932 --> 01:22:45,441
<i>and was feeling all right.</i>

1014
01:22:45,690 --> 01:22:51,112
<i>But when I looked into the room where the doctors
and nurses were preparing for the operation</i>

1015
01:22:52,169 --> 01:22:59,052
<i>it was as if I had to pass through
an impenetrable gate all by myself.</i>

1016
01:23:00,884 --> 01:23:03,431
<i>It wasn't just that
I missed my mom.</i>

1017
01:23:03,736 --> 01:23:07,920
<i>I don't think I missed my dad,
even though he was the nice one.</i>

1018
01:23:08,919 --> 01:23:13,468
<i>It was as if I was completely alone
in the universe.</i>

1019
01:23:15,542 --> 01:23:20,179
<i>As if my whole body was filled
with loneliness and tears.</i>

1020
01:23:43,965 --> 01:23:47,034
And I'm still not allowed
to feel sorry for you?

1021
01:23:48,934 --> 01:23:51,069
Shall we go on?

1022
01:23:57,615 --> 01:23:59,717
What are you reading?

1023
01:23:59,883 --> 01:24:02,420
I'm not reading really. I'm just

1024
01:24:02,468 --> 01:24:05,569
reacquainting myself
with Edgar Allan Poe.

1025
01:24:06,445 --> 01:24:07,780
I don't know him.

1026
01:24:07,891 --> 01:24:11,058
No. Well, he was a

1027
01:24:12,695 --> 01:24:15,297
very anxiety-ridden man.

1028
01:24:21,203 --> 01:24:24,840
He died in the most fearful
way you can imagine,

1029
01:24:24,934 --> 01:24:28,536
in something called
delirium tremens.

1030
01:24:30,041 --> 01:24:33,411
It occurs when a long time abuse
of alcohol is followed by...

1031
01:24:35,118 --> 01:24:37,617
by a sudden abstinence.

1032
01:24:39,009 --> 01:24:42,644
And your body goes into some
kind of a hypersensitive shock.

1033
01:24:43,976 --> 01:24:47,838
You can see the most
horrifying hallucinations, like

1034
01:24:48,235 --> 01:24:51,016
<i>rats and snakes
and cockroaches</i>

1035
01:24:51,047 --> 01:24:55,581
<i>coming out of the floor and
worms slithering in the walls.</i>

1036
01:24:58,806 --> 01:25:01,744
One's entire nervous
system is on high alert

1037
01:25:02,079 --> 01:25:05,388
and you have a constant
panic and paranoia.

1038
01:25:06,949 --> 01:25:09,983
And then the circulatory
system fails.

1039
01:25:10,616 --> 01:25:12,485
But the panic and horror

1040
01:25:13,147 --> 01:25:16,084
remains until the moment of death.

1041
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:34,753
I know what delirium is.

1042
01:25:38,573 --> 01:25:43,870
<i>"During the whole of a dull, dark, and
soundless day in the autumn of the year,</i>

1043
01:25:43,910 --> 01:25:47,112
<i>"when the clouds hung
oppressively low in the heavens,</i>

1044
01:25:47,838 --> 01:25:54,263
<i>"I had been passing alone, on horseback,
"through a singularly dreary tract of country,</i>

1045
01:25:54,689 --> 01:25:56,728
<i>"and at length found myself,</i>

1046
01:25:56,813 --> 01:25:59,413
<i>"as the shades of the
evening drew on,</i>

1047
01:25:59,501 --> 01:26:03,638
<i>"within view of the
melancholy House of Usher."</i>

1048
01:26:33,660 --> 01:26:36,127
Hey, dad.

1049
01:26:46,953 --> 01:26:48,648
Hey, love.

1050
01:26:50,551 --> 01:26:52,484
How are you?

1051
01:26:53,552 --> 01:26:55,319
I fought with mom.

1052
01:26:57,375 --> 01:26:59,807
She's... She's not coming.

1053
01:27:04,232 --> 01:27:06,701
You ought not to fight with her.

1054
01:27:06,740 --> 01:27:09,669
You know Kay's fear of hospitals.

1055
01:27:12,682 --> 01:27:14,783
I know she's not coming.

1056
01:27:14,839 --> 01:27:18,008
We already said everything
we needed to say.

1057
01:27:20,429 --> 01:27:22,730
Kay and I said goodbye at home.

1058
01:27:23,943 --> 01:27:25,776
I don't want her here at all.

1059
01:27:29,425 --> 01:27:31,392
I can't accept that.

1060
01:27:32,287 --> 01:27:34,271
You'll have to.

1061
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:37,495
She's a cowardly stupid bitch.

1062
01:27:38,837 --> 01:27:41,174
No, she's not.

1063
01:27:41,214 --> 01:27:43,347
- Yes.
- No, she's not.

1064
01:27:43,449 --> 01:27:44,644
- Yes.
- No, she's not.

1065
01:27:44,679 --> 01:27:47,381
Yes, she is, and you've
never understood that.

1066
01:27:59,785 --> 01:28:01,688
Mmm.

1067
01:28:02,503 --> 01:28:04,270
Doesn't it scare you?

1068
01:28:06,277 --> 01:28:07,894
No.

1069
01:28:10,536 --> 01:28:12,069
No.

1070
01:28:15,337 --> 01:28:17,672
How can you not be afraid?

1071
01:28:22,308 --> 01:28:24,776
I've seen so many die.

1072
01:28:26,768 --> 01:28:28,804
Then there's that...

1073
01:28:28,891 --> 01:28:32,026
Epicurus quote about
not fearing death.

1074
01:28:33,257 --> 01:28:36,159
"When we are, death has not come.

1075
01:28:37,398 --> 01:28:39,533
"When death has come...

1076
01:28:40,435 --> 01:28:41,901
"We are not."

1077
01:28:45,901 --> 01:28:48,604
We know what's going to happen.

1078
01:28:48,605 --> 01:28:51,673
I also know all of the drugs
the doctors have to offer.

1079
01:28:51,978 --> 01:28:53,284
So no...

1080
01:28:54,539 --> 01:28:55,706
I am not...

1081
01:28:56,698 --> 01:28:58,845
I am not afraid.

1082
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:04,183
Hmm. A beautiful girl.

1083
01:29:05,243 --> 01:29:07,944
Beautiful dad.

1084
01:29:29,713 --> 01:29:31,337
K-Kay!

1085
01:29:31,365 --> 01:29:34,351
Daddy, it's okay.

1086
01:29:34,781 --> 01:29:36,214
Kay?

1087
01:29:43,430 --> 01:29:45,296
Daddy.

1088
01:29:49,998 --> 01:29:51,146
Hey.

1089
01:29:55,191 --> 01:29:56,925
It's gonna be okay.

1090
01:30:17,147 --> 01:30:19,124
Don't you want to
take a little walk?

1091
01:30:19,546 --> 01:30:22,664
I'll stay with your
father in the meantime.

1092
01:30:22,665 --> 01:30:24,532
You'll stay?

1093
01:30:24,533 --> 01:30:27,168
- You'll stay here?
- Yes.

1094
01:31:09,620 --> 01:31:11,922
Ash tree leaves.

1095
01:31:13,892 --> 01:31:16,214
Where did you find them?

1096
01:31:16,273 --> 01:31:18,407
They were in the park.

1097
01:31:26,108 --> 01:31:29,711
It truly is the most beautiful
tree in the forest.

1098
01:31:33,620 --> 01:31:35,053
But, dad...

1099
01:31:35,805 --> 01:31:38,540
How do you recognize it in winter?

1100
01:31:39,666 --> 01:31:41,766
I've told you a hundred times.

1101
01:31:43,502 --> 01:31:45,669
But I can't remember.

1102
01:31:50,259 --> 01:31:52,193
When the ash tree was created...

1103
01:31:55,824 --> 01:31:58,994
It made all the other trees
in the forest jealous...

1104
01:31:59,991 --> 01:32:02,226
'Cause it was...

1105
01:32:03,962 --> 01:32:07,097
It was the most beautiful
tree in the forest.

1106
01:32:09,709 --> 01:32:11,810
It had the strongest wood.

1107
01:32:13,241 --> 01:32:18,111
It was the world tree
in Norse mythology.

1108
01:32:18,881 --> 01:32:21,983
You couldn't say
anything bad about it.

1109
01:32:26,287 --> 01:32:28,856
And when all the other trees...

1110
01:32:28,857 --> 01:32:31,669
saw the ash tree with its...

1111
01:32:31,719 --> 01:32:33,787
black buds...

1112
01:32:34,762 --> 01:32:37,131
They all started laughing.

1113
01:32:37,419 --> 01:32:39,433
"Oh, look...

1114
01:32:40,434 --> 01:32:44,003
"The ash tree's had its
fingers in the ashes."

1115
01:33:01,608 --> 01:33:04,359
Dad. Daddy!

1116
01:33:04,483 --> 01:33:08,029
Dad. Daddy, what's wrong?
Daddy, what's wrong?

1117
01:33:08,733 --> 01:33:10,031
Come on, what's wrong?

1118
01:33:10,561 --> 01:33:11,787
Daddy, it's me!

1119
01:33:11,846 --> 01:33:14,013
It's me, daddy. It's me!

1120
01:33:14,547 --> 01:33:17,383
Help! Help!

1121
01:33:17,928 --> 01:33:20,708
- Daddy, it's okay.
- Okay.

1122
01:33:21,451 --> 01:33:22,710
Okay.

1123
01:33:23,334 --> 01:33:25,833
- It's okay. Okay.
- Help me!

1124
01:33:25,881 --> 01:33:29,249
It's okay. It's all right.

1125
01:33:31,937 --> 01:33:33,370
It's all right.

1126
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:46,139
We have to fixate him.

1127
01:33:46,198 --> 01:33:47,698
What are you doing?

1128
01:33:48,168 --> 01:33:50,302
What are you doing to me?

1129
01:33:54,966 --> 01:33:58,401
Joe! What are you doing to me?

1130
01:34:08,256 --> 01:34:12,359
Joe! Help! Joe!

1131
01:34:20,401 --> 01:34:22,569
You should take a break.

1132
01:34:25,229 --> 01:34:26,502
Help!

1133
01:35:25,949 --> 01:35:27,517
Excuse me.

1134
01:35:27,753 --> 01:35:31,455
Can you help me to clean... um...

1135
01:35:32,537 --> 01:35:34,137
Oh.

1136
01:35:34,587 --> 01:35:36,322
Okay, mister... Don't worry.

1137
01:35:36,542 --> 01:35:39,408
Just... I need some help.

1138
01:36:13,238 --> 01:36:16,039
We're going to have
to change the sheets.

1139
01:36:26,181 --> 01:36:27,915
Ready?

1140
01:37:30,816 --> 01:37:32,717
<i>When he died,</i>

1141
01:37:32,962 --> 01:37:36,331
<i>I had no feelings left.</i>

1142
01:37:36,434 --> 01:37:39,000
<i>Well, that's certainly
understandable.</i>

1143
01:37:39,309 --> 01:37:42,490
<i>No. I don't know
what happened to me.</i>

1144
01:37:43,565 --> 01:37:45,768
<i>It was very shameful.</i>

1145
01:37:46,346 --> 01:37:48,509
<i>Shameful?</i>

1146
01:37:48,510 --> 01:37:50,911
<i>I don't understand.</i>

1147
01:38:16,166 --> 01:38:18,534
<i>I lubricated.</i>

1148
01:38:33,997 --> 01:38:36,372
I know you like to present
yourself in a negative way

1149
01:38:36,418 --> 01:38:41,551
and that you have this kind of dark bias
that you're worse than everyone else.

1150
01:38:41,578 --> 01:38:44,477
But this story doesn't
add to that belief.

1151
01:38:46,045 --> 01:38:49,717
It's extremely common to
react sexually in a crisis.

1152
01:38:50,343 --> 01:38:52,477
It may be shameful to you, but

1153
01:38:52,991 --> 01:38:56,913
in literature there's
many worse examples.

1154
01:39:24,875 --> 01:39:26,945
You listen to music, I see?

1155
01:39:27,102 --> 01:39:30,502
Yes. I like it a lot.

1156
01:39:31,452 --> 01:39:33,087
Shall I find a tape?

1157
01:39:33,182 --> 01:39:35,850
No, if there's a tape
already in the machine,

1158
01:39:35,851 --> 01:39:37,166
I'd like to hear that.

1159
01:39:37,390 --> 01:39:39,854
It's something I've been
listening to a lot lately,

1160
01:39:39,855 --> 01:39:43,799
though it's not an entirely
complete recording, unfortunately.

1161
01:39:43,848 --> 01:39:46,351
- What is it?
- It's Bach,

1162
01:39:46,743 --> 01:39:49,609
from his little organ book.

1163
01:39:50,679 --> 01:39:53,881
"Ich ruf zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ."

1164
01:39:56,133 --> 01:39:58,669
The theme is originally a hymn,

1165
01:39:59,093 --> 01:40:03,411
but Bach rearranged it and
embellished it a little.

1166
01:40:03,803 --> 01:40:06,960
He was the master of polyphony,
if you know what that is.

1167
01:40:07,025 --> 01:40:09,328
No. Yet another thing I don't know.

1168
01:40:09,752 --> 01:40:12,736
Well, polyphony is
from the middle ages.

1169
01:40:12,775 --> 01:40:15,311
It's an entirely
European phenomenon.

1170
01:40:16,072 --> 01:40:17,470
It's distinguished by...

1171
01:40:17,524 --> 01:40:20,705
By the idea that every voice

1172
01:40:20,966 --> 01:40:23,431
is its own melody

1173
01:40:23,432 --> 01:40:26,533
but together in harmony.

1174
01:40:27,734 --> 01:40:30,171
Bach's forerunner Palestrina, he...

1175
01:40:30,198 --> 01:40:37,544
He wrote many works for several choirs at
the same time, wallowing in... in polyphony.

1176
01:40:46,788 --> 01:40:52,491
But in my eyes, Bach perfected the
melodic expression and the harmony.

1177
01:40:52,685 --> 01:40:55,320
And also... Also mixed
up with some...

1178
01:40:55,431 --> 01:40:59,734
rather incomprehensible
mystique regarding numbers,

1179
01:40:59,891 --> 01:41:03,925
most likely based on the
Fibonacci sequence.

1180
01:41:05,032 --> 01:41:09,477
You know, the one that starts with
a zero, and then comes the one.

1181
01:41:09,478 --> 01:41:13,032
The sequence is created by
adding the two previous numbers

1182
01:41:13,053 --> 01:41:16,415
to create the new one, so
it's zero plus one makes one,

1183
01:41:16,450 --> 01:41:19,330
and one plus one makes two,
and two plus one makes three,

1184
01:41:19,367 --> 01:41:22,836
and three plus two makes five,
and five plus three makes eight,

1185
01:41:22,921 --> 01:41:24,764
and eight plus five makes 13.

1186
01:41:24,788 --> 01:41:29,963
The sequence has an interesting connection to
Pythagoras' theorem and the golden section.

1187
01:41:31,266 --> 01:41:36,415
<i>It was all about finding a divine
methodology in art and architecture.</i>

1188
01:41:36,469 --> 01:41:38,298
<i>A bit like the way a tritone,</i>

1189
01:41:38,353 --> 01:41:40,921
<i>which was played on the
piano in your little club was</i>

1190
01:41:40,961 --> 01:41:44,262
<i>supposed to be a
satanic interval.</i>

1191
01:41:44,435 --> 01:41:47,435
<i>The sum of the numeric values
represented in Bach's name</i>

1192
01:41:47,491 --> 01:41:51,459
<i>is 14, a number he often
used in his compositions.</i>

1193
01:41:51,592 --> 01:41:53,728
<i>The clever thing about Bach's name</i>

1194
01:41:53,768 --> 01:41:57,037
is that the numeric value
of the individual letters

1195
01:41:57,061 --> 01:41:59,594
are all Fibonacci numbers.

1196
01:42:02,212 --> 01:42:04,516
This piece has three voices:

1197
01:42:04,658 --> 01:42:06,391
A bass voice...

1198
01:42:11,827 --> 01:42:14,063
The second voice played
with the left hand...

1199
01:42:18,361 --> 01:42:20,929
The first voice played
with the right hand.

1200
01:42:20,992 --> 01:42:24,158
<i>That is called cantus firmus
or "can-toos feer-mus".</i>

1201
01:42:24,185 --> 01:42:28,494
And together, these three
voices create the polyphony.

1202
01:42:31,481 --> 01:42:35,317
Normally, a nymphomaniac is seen as

1203
01:42:35,624 --> 01:42:38,661
someone who can't get enough

1204
01:42:38,701 --> 01:42:41,372
and therefore has sex with
many different people.

1205
01:42:41,434 --> 01:42:45,388
Well, that of course is true,
but if I'm to be honest,

1206
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:47,817
I see it precisely as

1207
01:42:48,010 --> 01:42:53,179
the sum of all these different
sexual experiences.

1208
01:42:54,216 --> 01:42:58,885
So in that way,
I have only one lover.

1209
01:43:03,056 --> 01:43:05,509
<i>Since the music has three voices,</i>

1210
01:43:05,549 --> 01:43:09,183
<i>I will limit myself to
talking about three lovers.</i>

1211
01:43:10,466 --> 01:43:13,903
<i>The bass is easy. That's F.</i>

1212
01:43:14,139 --> 01:43:18,441
<i>F had a red car that
he'd bought used.</i>

1213
01:43:20,438 --> 01:43:25,780
<i>As I was having sex with seven or
eight men every night at the time,</i>

1214
01:43:25,868 --> 01:43:28,047
<i>scheduling was tricky</i>

1215
01:43:28,090 --> 01:43:31,459
<i>and they all had to have
precise appointments.</i>

1216
01:43:31,687 --> 01:43:34,322
<i>F was a good man.</i>

1217
01:43:34,323 --> 01:43:37,108
<i>If he was scheduled for 10:00,</i>

1218
01:43:37,162 --> 01:43:39,330
<i>he always showed up around 9:00</i>

1219
01:43:39,362 --> 01:43:41,304
<i>and parked down in the street.</i>

1220
01:43:41,383 --> 01:43:44,184
<i>I always smiled when I saw him.</i>

1221
01:43:45,166 --> 01:43:48,937
<i>Often I took pity on him
and gave him a cup of coffee</i>

1222
01:43:48,975 --> 01:43:51,874
<i>while I was finishing
with the one before.</i>

1223
01:43:54,197 --> 01:43:57,353
<i>It's hard to say why I'm
choosing to talk about F,</i>

1224
01:43:57,400 --> 01:43:59,377
<i>but he was reassuring,</i>

1225
01:43:59,512 --> 01:44:03,380
<i>and he knew exactly what
I wanted when we had sex.</i>

1226
01:44:03,741 --> 01:44:06,255
<i>No, I'd go even further</i>

1227
01:44:06,281 --> 01:44:10,893
<i>and say that there was a kind of
telepathy going on when we had sex.</i>

1228
01:44:11,830 --> 01:44:15,962
<i>Without words,
he knew exactly what I wanted,</i>

1229
01:44:15,963 --> 01:44:20,032
<i>where he should touch me
and what he should do.</i>

1230
01:44:21,022 --> 01:44:26,027
<i>The most sacred goal
for F was my orgasm.</i>

1231
01:44:26,340 --> 01:44:29,307
Well, and then...

1232
01:44:29,410 --> 01:44:33,445
the swans answered
in the same voice.

1233
01:44:33,469 --> 01:44:37,603
<i>And granted him privileges
none of the others received.</i>

1234
01:44:43,991 --> 01:44:46,179
<i>F was the bass voice.</i>

1235
01:44:46,263 --> 01:44:50,166
<i>Monotone, predictable
and ritualistic.</i>

1236
01:44:50,207 --> 01:44:52,141
<i>No doubt about it.</i>

1237
01:44:52,197 --> 01:44:56,300
<i>But also the foundation
that is so important</i>

1238
01:44:56,332 --> 01:45:00,401
<i>even if, on its own,
it doesn't mean much.</i>

1239
01:45:31,772 --> 01:45:34,074
<i>G was quite different.</i>

1240
01:45:35,096 --> 01:45:39,133
<i>The only one I had to
and wanted to wait for.</i>

1241
01:45:39,732 --> 01:45:43,116
<i>When he finally turned up
and I opened the door,</i>

1242
01:45:43,411 --> 01:45:45,700
<i>he didn't immediately enter,</i>

1243
01:45:45,786 --> 01:45:48,455
<i>the way a cat doesn't
when you let it in,</i>

1244
01:45:48,824 --> 01:45:51,459
<i>as if once the door is open,</i>

1245
01:45:51,460 --> 01:45:54,326
<i>it has all the time in the world.</i>

1246
01:46:00,298 --> 01:46:02,467
<i>But he was more than a cat.</i>

1247
01:46:02,522 --> 01:46:06,357
<i>He was like some kind
of jaguar or leopard.</i>

1248
01:46:08,042 --> 01:46:09,810
<i>He moved like them,</i>

1249
01:46:09,944 --> 01:46:13,379
<i>which turned me on no end.</i>

1250
01:46:23,095 --> 01:46:24,845
<i>He was in charge.</i>

1251
01:46:24,926 --> 01:46:27,694
<i>That's the way it was.</i>

1252
01:47:22,871 --> 01:47:28,434
<i>Despite my success in managing the
complicated logistics involved in arranging</i>

1253
01:47:28,488 --> 01:47:31,723
<i>up to 10 daily sexual satisfactions,</i>

1254
01:47:32,060 --> 01:47:34,849
<i>while also having a full-time job,</i>

1255
01:47:34,912 --> 01:47:37,980
<i>I was still prone to
a certain sadness.</i>

1256
01:47:38,216 --> 01:47:41,083
<i>So when my busy life
allowed a few breaks,</i>

1257
01:47:41,117 --> 01:47:43,585
<i>I used them to take my walks.</i>

1258
01:47:44,448 --> 01:47:48,988
<i>These repeated walks became
a kind of metaphor for my life,</i>

1259
01:47:49,067 --> 01:47:51,238
<i>monotonous and pointless.</i>

1260
01:47:53,530 --> 01:47:57,951
<i>Yes, precisely like
the movements of a caged animal.</i>

1261
01:47:59,048 --> 01:48:02,082
<i>Basically, we're all waiting
for permission to die.</i>

1262
01:49:09,602 --> 01:49:11,470
<i>No.</i>

1263
01:49:11,672 --> 01:49:13,165
<i>No no no.</i>

1264
01:49:13,230 --> 01:49:14,631
No, there...

1265
01:49:14,719 --> 01:49:19,933
There are some completely unrealistic
coincidences in your story about Jerôme.

1266
01:49:21,334 --> 01:49:24,004
First, by chance he hires you as...

1267
01:49:24,005 --> 01:49:26,709
As an assistant and then you
take a walk in a forest

1268
01:49:26,748 --> 01:49:28,521
that is littered with
photographs of him.

1269
01:49:28,563 --> 01:49:31,898
And not only that, he's present.

1270
01:49:32,803 --> 01:49:37,014
And then like a god, pulls you
up to him through the clouds.

1271
01:49:37,652 --> 01:49:39,953
<i>Goodness gracious.</i>

1272
01:49:41,137 --> 01:49:44,129
<i>Jerôme was there because he had
just had a fight with his wife,</i>

1273
01:49:44,197 --> 01:49:48,352
<i>who, in anger, tore up the photographs they
just had developed from their travels.</i>

1274
01:49:48,525 --> 01:49:51,093
<i>Oh, I don't know if
I can believe this.</i>

1275
01:49:51,133 --> 01:49:54,335
<i>Which way do you think you'd
get the most out of my story?</i>

1276
01:49:54,475 --> 01:49:57,411
<i>By believing in it or
by not believing in it?</i>

1277
01:49:58,312 --> 01:49:59,757
<i>No, you're right.</i>

1278
01:49:59,794 --> 01:50:02,028
<i>You might have a
point with all this.</i>

1279
01:50:05,713 --> 01:50:10,349
The secret ingredient
to sex is love.

1280
01:50:13,661 --> 01:50:16,997
The third voice: The secret ingredient.

1281
01:50:17,420 --> 01:50:20,254
Cantus firmus.

1282
01:51:02,698 --> 01:51:04,065
Ah.

1283
01:51:38,865 --> 01:51:41,834
Fill all my holes.

1284
01:52:41,017 --> 01:52:44,286
What's wrong? Hmm?

1285
01:52:45,667 --> 01:52:47,541
I can't feel anything.

1286
01:52:47,587 --> 01:52:49,787
- Huh?
- I can't feel anything.

1287
01:52:52,699 --> 01:52:55,281
I can't feel anything.

1288
01:52:56,935 --> 01:52:59,570
I can't... anything.
