I could shave a spider's arse if I wanted to.

56

Or... I could nick this artery in your leg.

And once it's nicked,

58

there's no one around here

I'm not Ned Stark.
I understand the way this game is played.

Ned Stark was a man of honor.

And I am not.

Somewhat less wild these days.

136
00:09:21,729 --> 00:09:23,939
Seems they've stopped killing each other

137
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:26,734
and started following
this king-beyond-the-Wall.

138
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,236
Another king? How many is that now?

139
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,405
Five? (LAUGHS) I've lost count.

140
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:35,075
The Lord Commander asks
that we send more men to man the Wall.

141
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:38,620

one of these dead men
attacked him in his chambers.

153
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:15,157
that separates us from
what lies beyond the Wall.

160

333
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:14,060
A very wealthy patron,
he offered me a tremendous amount of money

334
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:15,979
to let him transform

To use her in ways

337
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:24,862
that would never occur to most men.

But you know what occurs to most men.

I would not say he succeeded
in making her happy,

- Had to be done.

consider Robert's bastards

00:30:45,803 --> 00:30:47,346
Do you think I'm as stupid
as the rest of them?

486
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,472
Stupider.

487
00:30:48,556 --> 00:30:50,474
The Night's Watch doesn't take girls,
everyone knows that.

488
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:53,019
- Yeah, that's true, but you're still a girl.
- I am not!

489
00:30:53,102 --> 00:30:55,688
Yeah? Well, pull your cock out
and take a piss, then.

490
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:58,357
I don't need to take a piss.

491
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,782
Lommy and Hot Pie can't know.

492
00:31:06,866 --> 00:31:08,284
No one can know.

493
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:11,954
Well, they won't. Not from me.

494
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:16,459
My name's not Arry.

495
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:20,046
It's Arya, of House Stark.

496
00:31:22,173 --> 00:31:24,300
Yoren is taking me home to Winterfell.

497
00:31:25,593 --> 00:31:28,763
He was your father, the Hand, the traitor.

498
00:31:28,846 --> 00:31:30,347
He was never a traitor.

499
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:32,349
Joffrey is a liar.

500
00:31:33,434 --> 00:31:35,227
So you're a highborn, then. You're a lady.

501
00:31:35,311 --> 00:31:37,188
No. I mean, yes.

502
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:38,814
My mother was a lady and my sister...

503
00:31:38,898 --> 00:31:42,443
Yeah, but you were a lord's daughter,
and you lived in a castle and you...

504
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:45,237
Look, all that about cocks,
I should never have said...

505
00:31:45,321 --> 00:31:47,865
And I've been pissing
in front of you and everything.

506
00:31:48,991 --> 00:31:50,367
I should be calling you "my lady."

507
00:31:50,451 --> 00:31:53,245
- Do not call me "my lady."
- As my lady commands.

508
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:55,206
Well, that was unladylike.

509
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:56,791
Oh!

510
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:59,001
(LAUGHS)

511
00:32:24,527 --> 00:32:26,278
What's she carrying?

512
00:32:27,655 --> 00:32:29,240
Myrish oranges,

513
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:30,991
wine from the Arbor...

514
00:32:32,326 --> 00:32:34,870
and the heir to Pyke and the Iron Islands.

515
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:41,293
The only living son of Balon Greyjoy.

516
00:32:45,047 --> 00:32:46,048
Me.

517
00:32:47,925 --> 00:32:49,468
I don't like wine.

518
00:32:50,219 --> 00:32:51,512
Woman's drink.

519
00:32:55,057 --> 00:32:56,433
I need to get to Pyke.

520
00:33:06,402 --> 00:33:08,195
I'll find you a horse.

521
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:22,293
I'm heading that way. I can take you there.

522
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:24,753
I bet you can.

523
00:33:25,087 --> 00:33:26,922
Have you been at sea long?

524
00:33:27,173 --> 00:33:29,550
Or were there just no women
where you came from?

525
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:31,802
- None like you.
- You don't know what I'm like.

526
00:33:32,553 --> 00:33:34,513
Maybe you don't know what you're like.

527
00:33:34,597 --> 00:33:36,724
Maybe you need someone to teach you.

528
00:33:38,184 --> 00:33:39,685
Do you know who I am?

529
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:43,063
You think I offer free rides
to every man in jewelry,

530
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,608
Lord Greyjoy?

531
00:33:48,402 --> 00:33:50,988
Have my things sent up to the castle.

532
00:34:08,172 --> 00:34:09,590
You should give me the reins.

533
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:11,300
I'm a better rider than you.

534
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,302
I've been on horseback
for the past nine years.

535
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:14,887
Nine years?

536
00:34:15,012 --> 00:34:17,765
Do you still know your way around a ship?

537
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:19,808
Have these hands ever touched a rope?

538
00:34:20,017 --> 00:34:22,311
Don't you worry about my hands.

539
00:34:24,063 --> 00:34:26,357
The sea is in my blood.

540
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,443
Your blood will be in the sea
if I don't watch where I'm going.

541
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:31,987
I have a proposal for my father,

542
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:35,407
one that will make him king again,

543
00:34:35,491 --> 00:34:37,117
and me after him.

544
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:42,331
You may get to stay
in a castle tonight if you're lucky.

545
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:44,541
Is that an offer from my future king?

546
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:46,752
An order from your future king.

547
00:34:49,338 --> 00:34:51,966
You can tell your grandchildren
about this night.

548
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:55,427
I don't imagine it will be
a story fit for children.

549
00:35:02,393 --> 00:35:04,436
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

550
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:09,441
THEON: Father.

551
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:12,528
BALON: Nine years, is it?

552
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:15,781
They took a frightened boy.

553
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:18,200
What have they given back?

554
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:21,161
A man.

555
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:24,373
- Your blood and your heir.
- We shall see.

556
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,794
Stark had you longer than I did.

557
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:31,588
Lord Stark is gone.

558
00:35:33,424 --> 00:35:35,884
And how do you feel about that?

559
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:41,056
What's done is done.

560
00:35:42,391 --> 00:35:44,143
I've brought you a proposal from Robb Stark.

561
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:45,728
Who gave you those clothes?

562
00:35:47,146 --> 00:35:50,733
Was it Ned Stark's pleasure
to make you his daughter?

563
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:53,652
If my clothes offend you, I will change them.

564
00:35:53,736 --> 00:35:54,862
You will.

565
00:35:56,322 --> 00:35:58,699
That bauble round your neck,

566
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:01,952
did you pay the iron price for it, or the gold?

567
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:04,830
I asked a question.

568
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:07,458
Did you pull it from the neck
of a corpse you made

569
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:11,795
or did you buy it to match your fine clothes?

570
00:36:13,964 --> 00:36:16,425
Iron or gold?

571
00:36:19,553 --> 00:36:20,596
Gold.

572
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:28,270
I'll not have my son dressed as a whore.

573
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:33,734
My fears have come true,

574
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:36,111
the Starks have made you theirs.

575
00:36:36,195 --> 00:36:39,239
- My blood is salt and iron.
- Yet the Stark boy sends you to me

576
00:36:39,323 --> 00:36:42,618
like a trained raven clutching his message.

577
00:36:42,743 --> 00:36:44,536
The offer he makes is one I proposed.

578
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:47,247
- He heeds your counsel?
- I've lived with him,

579
00:36:47,373 --> 00:36:48,874
hunted with him, fought at his side.

580
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:50,459
He thinks of me as a brother.

581
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:53,295
No, not here, not in my hearing.

582
00:36:53,379 --> 00:36:55,672
You will not name him brother,

583
00:36:55,756 --> 00:36:59,718
this son of the man who put
your true brothers to the sword.

584
00:36:59,802 --> 00:37:02,596
Or have you forgotten your own blood?

585
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:04,598
I forget nothing.

586
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:06,517
I remember my brothers.

587
00:37:07,601 --> 00:37:10,020
And I remember when my father was a king.

588
00:37:26,829 --> 00:37:27,830
I see.

589
00:37:28,539 --> 00:37:31,250
I destroy Robb Stark's enemies for him

590
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:34,628
and he will make me
king of the Iron Islands once again.

591
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:37,381
- I will lead the attack myself.
- Oh, you will?

592
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:41,176
I'm your son, your only living heir.

593
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,178
- Who else?
- (DOOR OPENS)

594
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:47,558
I told you to wait outside.

595
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:50,853
How did you get past the guards?

596
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:53,313
Anything with a cock is easy to fool.

597
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:55,524
My dear.

598
00:37:59,653 --> 00:38:00,737
Yara?

599
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:03,198
So good to see you, brother.

600
00:38:04,116 --> 00:38:07,619
This is a homecoming
I'll tell my grandchildren about.

601
00:38:10,456 --> 00:38:12,749
- She can't lead an attack!
- BALON: And why not?

602
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:14,793
You're a woman!

603
00:38:14,877 --> 00:38:18,297
- You're the one in skirts.
- This isn't Winterfell, boy.

604
00:38:18,464 --> 00:38:20,966
Your sister took over command
of your eldest brother's ship

605
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:23,802
after your new father killed him.

606
00:38:23,886 --> 00:38:26,847
- What's dead may never die.
- ...dead may never die.

607
00:38:27,723 --> 00:38:31,560
The only nights she's spent off these islands
have been spent on the sea.

608
00:38:32,686 --> 00:38:34,605
She's commanded men.

609
00:38:34,688 --> 00:38:36,190
She's killed men.

610
00:38:36,899 --> 00:38:38,901
She knows who she is.

611
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,989
No man gives me a crown.

612
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:46,825
I pay the iron price.

613
00:38:47,326 --> 00:38:49,244
I will take my crown,

614
00:38:49,786 --> 00:38:51,955
for that is who I am.

615
00:38:52,748 --> 00:38:54,791
That is who we have always been.

616
00:38:59,713 --> 00:39:01,965
You won't stand a chance
against the Lannisters on your own.

617
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:04,760
Who said anything about the Lannisters?

618
00:39:12,518 --> 00:39:15,354
DAVOS: You'll have your gold
when we take the treasury at King's Landing.

619
00:39:15,437 --> 00:39:17,272
SALLADHOR:
All these kings fighting for the throne,

620
00:39:17,356 --> 00:39:20,192
and this Stannis has the smallest army.

621
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:22,694
Why would I bet on the man
with the worst chance?

622
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,738
Because you're a smart gambler.

623
00:39:25,572 --> 00:39:28,492
Stannis has proved himself in war twice.

624
00:39:28,575 --> 00:39:31,745
His baby brother has never set foot
on a battlefield.

625
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:33,580
Neither has the false King Joffrey.

626
00:39:33,664 --> 00:39:35,624
And yet they both have larger armies.

627
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:37,543
Stannis has just begun the fight.

628
00:39:37,626 --> 00:39:40,587
His bannermen will rally to his cause.

629
00:39:41,421 --> 00:39:45,592
There's no man in the Seven Kingdoms
more honorable than Stannis Baratheon

630
00:39:45,676 --> 00:39:47,094
or more worthy of loyalty.

631
00:39:47,177 --> 00:39:48,595
What is the world coming to

632
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:51,223
when smugglers must vouch
for the honor of kings?

633
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:53,642
- Mind your words, pirate.
- Matthos.

634
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:55,435
You think I'm insulted?

635
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:58,397
I am a pirate. I'm an excellent pirate.

636
00:39:58,772 --> 00:40:00,440
I don't sail for promises.

637
00:40:00,524 --> 00:40:01,984
Of course you do.

638
00:40:02,484 --> 00:40:05,070
Every time you leave harbor,
you're leaving on a promise,

639
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:06,613
a promise that somewhere on the sea,

640
00:40:06,697 --> 00:40:09,032
somebody's got some gold
and you can take it from him.

641
00:40:09,116 --> 00:40:11,660
- That's a promise that always comes true.
- As is mine.

642
00:40:12,286 --> 00:40:14,121
You're not a young man, Salladhor.

643
00:40:14,204 --> 00:40:17,666
And correct me if I'm wrong,
most pirates don't grow old.

644
00:40:18,584 --> 00:40:19,876
Only the clever ones.

645
00:40:20,669 --> 00:40:22,754
You want to spend
your last few years on the sea

646
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:26,592
stealing from Pentoshi cheesemongers
and Myrenese silk merchants, then go.

647
00:40:26,675 --> 00:40:29,845
They're out there waiting for you. That's easy.

648
00:40:30,304 --> 00:40:32,139
What I'm offering you is hard.

649
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:37,144
Come with me and plunder
the greatest city in Westeros.

650
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:40,897
You'll be the richest man in Lys,
and the most famous.

651
00:40:40,981 --> 00:40:44,818
They'll be singing songs about you
as long as men have voices to sing.

652
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:48,864
"Salladhor Saan" is a good name for songs.

653
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:52,367
- It is.
- One thing, I want the queen.

654
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:55,329
- The queen?
- Cersei, I want her.

655
00:40:55,412 --> 00:40:57,914
I'll sail with your fleet, all 30 of my ships.

656
00:40:57,998 --> 00:41:00,167
And if we don't drown at the bottom
of Blackwater Bay,

657
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:03,462
I will fuck this blonde queen
and I'll fuck her well.

658
00:41:03,545 --> 00:41:05,380
MATTHOS: This war isn't about you.

659
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:09,134
We're not attacking King's Landing
so that you can rape the queen.

660
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:11,720
I'm not going to rape her.
I'm going to fuck her.

661
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,513
As if she would just let you.

662
00:41:13,597 --> 00:41:15,432
You don't know how persuasive I am.

663
00:41:16,183 --> 00:41:17,893
I've never tried to fuck you.

664
00:41:20,062 --> 00:41:22,856
Stannis is the rightful king
and the Lord of Light,

665
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:24,399
the one true god...

666
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:25,984
I've been all over the world, my boy,

667
00:41:26,068 --> 00:41:29,029
and everywhere I go,
people tell me about the true gods.

668
00:41:29,112 --> 00:41:30,864
They all think they found the right one.

669
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:34,117
The one true god
is what's between a woman's legs,

670
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:36,745
and better yet, a queen's legs.

671
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:40,499
I never thought you'd have
a true believer for a son.

672
00:41:40,582 --> 00:41:41,875
He's young yet.

673
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:46,129
I promise you the gold.
I promise you the glory.

674
00:41:46,213 --> 00:41:47,714
I cannot promise you the queen.

675
00:41:51,677 --> 00:41:53,095
You believe your king can win?

676
00:41:53,762 --> 00:41:55,430
He is the one true king.

677
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:57,307
You Westerosi are funny people.

678
00:41:57,724 --> 00:42:00,602
A man chops off your fingers
and you fall in love with him.

679
00:42:02,896 --> 00:42:05,065
I'll sail with you, Davos Seaworth.

680
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:07,901
You're the most honest smuggler I ever met.

681
00:42:08,735 --> 00:42:11,029
Make me rich.

682
00:42:11,113 --> 00:42:14,241
Get me to the gates
of King's Landing and I will.

683
00:42:26,253 --> 00:42:27,921
MATTHOS: When will the king have us sail?

684
00:42:28,004 --> 00:42:30,048
As soon as his god wills it.

685
00:42:30,132 --> 00:42:32,759
He's my god, too, and yours,

686
00:42:32,843 --> 00:42:35,262
but you are too blind to see.

687
00:42:37,514 --> 00:42:39,641
- Let me teach you how to read.
- Oh, you and your mother.

688
00:42:39,725 --> 00:42:41,268
It won't take long.
You already know the letters.

689
00:42:41,351 --> 00:42:43,562
The holy books are
much more persuasive than I can be.

690
00:42:43,645 --> 00:42:45,397
I wish I had a god, truly.

691
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,233
I'm not mocking you,
but I've seen men pray to every god there is,

692
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:50,569
pray for wind, pray for rain, pray for home.

693
00:42:50,652 --> 00:42:53,363
- None of it works.
- But you always came home.

694
00:42:53,447 --> 00:42:54,990
I wasn't praying.

695
00:42:55,949 --> 00:42:57,743
But I was.

696
00:42:58,827 --> 00:43:00,412
Every night that you were at sea,

697
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:03,331
I lit a candle and I prayed for you.

698
00:43:04,833 --> 00:43:06,293
You want me to have a god?

699
00:43:06,376 --> 00:43:09,463
Fine. King Stannis is my god.

700
00:43:09,546 --> 00:43:11,965
He raised me up
and blessed me with his trust.

701
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:14,718
He gave you a future
I could never have imagined.

702
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:16,678
You know how to read.
You'll be a knight someday.

703
00:43:16,762 --> 00:43:19,973
You think a fire god commanded all that?

704
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:23,351
It was Stannis, only Stannis.

705
00:43:23,852 --> 00:43:26,396
Stannis is my king, but he's only a man.

706
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,232
Don't tell him that. (LAUGHS)

707
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:33,236
CERSEI: Lord Janos Slynt
was commander of the City Watch.

708
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,738
You had no right to exile him.

709
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:36,364
I have every right. I am the King's Hand.

710
00:43:36,448 --> 00:43:39,159
You're serving as the King's Hand
till Father gets here.

711
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:40,577
I am Queen Regent.

712
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,287
Listen to me, Queen Regent.

713
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:43,830
You're losing the people.

714
00:43:44,706 --> 00:43:46,833
- Do you hear me?
- (LAUGHS) The people.

715
00:43:47,209 --> 00:43:48,627
You think I care?

716
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:52,547
You might find it difficult
to rule over millions who want you dead.

717
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:57,469
Half the city will starve when winter comes.
The other half will plot to overthrow you.

718
00:43:57,552 --> 00:44:01,139
And your gold-plated thugs
just gave them their rallying cry,

719
00:44:01,723 --> 00:44:03,975
"The Queen slaughters babies."

720
00:44:06,645 --> 00:44:09,189
You don't even have the decency to deny it.

721
00:44:19,741 --> 00:44:21,910
It wasn't you who gave the order, was it?

722
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:24,579
Joffrey didn't even tell you.

723
00:44:27,457 --> 00:44:29,000
Did he tell you?

724
00:44:29,084 --> 00:44:30,919
I imagine that would be even worse.

725
00:44:31,211 --> 00:44:33,380
He did what needed to be done.

726
00:44:33,463 --> 00:44:36,508
You want to be Hand of the King?
You want to rule?

727
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:39,970
This is what ruling is,
lying on a bed of weeds,

728
00:44:40,053 --> 00:44:41,847
ripping them out by the root, one by one,

729
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:43,640
before they strangle you in your sleep.

730
00:44:43,723 --> 00:44:46,142
I'm no king,
but I think there's more to ruling than that.

731
00:44:46,226 --> 00:44:47,769
I don't care what you think!

732
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:49,604
You've never taken it seriously.

733
00:44:49,688 --> 00:44:51,398
You haven't, Jaime hasn't.

734
00:44:55,569 --> 00:44:57,070
It's all fallen on me.

735
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:05,161
As has Jaime, repeatedly,
according to Stannis Baratheon.

736
00:45:10,667 --> 00:45:12,127
You're funny.

737
00:45:15,964 --> 00:45:18,049
You've always been funny...

738
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:22,345
but none of your jokes will ever match
the first one, will they?

739
00:45:24,139 --> 00:45:25,807
You remember?

740
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:29,227
Back when you ripped my mother open
on your way out of her

741
00:45:29,311 --> 00:45:31,187
and she bled to death?

742
00:45:33,189 --> 00:45:35,275
She was my mother, too.

743
00:45:35,483 --> 00:45:36,943
Mother gone...

744
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:40,989
for the sake of you.

745
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:46,745
There's no bigger joke in the world than that.

746
00:46:06,598 --> 00:46:08,141
(DOOR OPENS)

747
00:46:09,017 --> 00:46:11,937
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

748
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:14,064
STANNIS: How did you fare with your pirate?

749
00:46:14,147 --> 00:46:17,567
Salladhor Saan will join our fleet, 30 ships.

750
00:46:17,651 --> 00:46:19,569
His men know how to fight.

751
00:46:19,653 --> 00:46:23,114
In my experience,
pirates prefer fighting unarmed men.

752
00:46:23,198 --> 00:46:24,616
It does seem the wiser choice.

753
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:27,035
There won't be a choice this time.

754
00:46:28,328 --> 00:46:29,412
Do you trust him?

755
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:33,667
Salladhor Saan is an old friend.
I've known him 30 years.

756
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:35,669
I've never trusted him.

757
00:46:36,252 --> 00:46:39,547
Now, once he gets the smell of gold
he never stops.

758
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:43,218
Well, if he does his job, he'll have his share.

759
00:46:46,972 --> 00:46:48,014
Leave us.

760
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:55,730
At once, Your Grace.

761
00:47:03,029 --> 00:47:06,074
The Lord of Light shines through you,
young warrior.

762

(WHISPERING)

763
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:12,956
Come.

764
00:47:20,547 --> 00:47:21,798
What did you say to him?

765
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:24,801
I told him death by fire is the purest death.

766
00:47:25,802 --> 00:47:27,804
- Why?
- Because it is true.

767
00:47:29,848 --> 00:47:31,266
You're troubled, my king.

768
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:33,435
Yeah.

769
00:47:33,601 --> 00:47:36,104
These armies are toys for the Lord of Light.

770
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:39,190
Tell your lord to burn them, then.

771
00:47:39,274 --> 00:47:40,692
I tell him nothing.

772
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:43,778
I pray for his commands and I obey.

773
00:47:45,822 --> 00:47:49,617
My little brother has 100,000 men,
according to the scouts,

774
00:47:49,701 --> 00:47:52,537
men whose allegiance rightly belongs to me.

775
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,456
You must have faith.

776
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:55,957
Faith?

777
00:47:57,625 --> 00:48:00,253
In a real war, the side with
the greater number wins,

778
00:48:00,336 --> 00:48:01,963
nine times out of ten.

779
00:48:02,464 --> 00:48:03,882
Then we must be the 10th.

780
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:07,093
I cannot defeat my brother in the field.

781
00:48:08,428 --> 00:48:11,806
And I can't take King's Landing
without the men he's stolen.

782
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:16,978
I have seen the path to victory in the flames.

783
00:48:18,688 --> 00:48:21,858
But first, you must give yourself
to the Lord of Light.

784
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:24,652
I've said the words, damn you.

785
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:30,575
I burned the idols.

786
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:37,373
You must give all of yourself.

787
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:43,755
I have a wife.

788
00:48:46,049 --> 00:48:47,300
I took a vow.

789
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:52,514
She's sickly, weak...

790
00:48:54,641 --> 00:48:56,434
Shut away in a tower.

791
00:48:57,769 --> 00:48:59,771
She disgusts you.

792
00:49:03,191 --> 00:49:05,985
And she's given you nothing,

793
00:49:06,194 --> 00:49:09,781
no sons, only stillborns,

794
00:49:11,032 --> 00:49:12,575
only death.

795
00:49:18,998 --> 00:49:23,044
(WHISPERING) I will give you a son, my king.

796
00:49:26,047 --> 00:49:27,090
