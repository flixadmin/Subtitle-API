1
00:00:03,713 --> 00:00:06,174
Come on, Cap,
can't we just roll one more?

2
00:00:06,257 --> 00:00:07,509
- No!
- No!

3
00:00:07,592 --> 00:00:09,719
Sorry. We'll have a rematch
at our next date night.

4
00:00:10,178 --> 00:00:13,097
I don't know about all of y'all,
but I'm done with space.

5
00:00:13,181 --> 00:00:15,058
Get these shoes on solid ground.

6
00:00:15,141 --> 00:00:16,768
Agreed, but not in those shoes.

7
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:18,353
We need to talk about your footwear.

8
00:00:18,436 --> 00:00:20,748
Try to put a heel on me
and I'll show you where to stick it.

9
00:00:20,772 --> 00:00:22,190
Oh, I'm with Miss Cruz on this one.

10
00:00:22,273 --> 00:00:25,151
I think it's about time
that we all return to where we belong.

11
00:00:25,235 --> 00:00:26,611
- Don't you think?
- Right.

12
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:28,154
Okay, message received.

13
00:00:28,238 --> 00:00:31,908
You are correct.
It is time for us to swap back.

14
00:00:31,991 --> 00:00:33,701
- It's not forever.
- I know.

15
00:00:33,785 --> 00:00:35,203
- We got this.
- Yeah.

16
00:00:39,832 --> 00:00:43,127
Okay, fancy Z, time to come out.

17
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,924
Oh, B, I... [sighs]

18
00:00:48,258 --> 00:00:51,386
- John, I missed your face so much.
- I missed you so much.

19
00:00:53,513 --> 00:00:57,767
- Wait, are we in actual space?
- [Nate] Yup.

20
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,103
- Uh... Do I wanna know why?
- Desperate times.

21
00:01:00,186 --> 00:01:02,272
The world was at stake.
All that malarkey.

22
00:01:02,355 --> 00:01:05,525
Let me explain it to you
over a nice cuppa cha,

23
00:01:05,608 --> 00:01:06,985
maybe a foot massage, yeah?

24
00:01:07,068 --> 00:01:09,237
Talk later, Z. Boos before bros.

25
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,823
- Unless your other bro is a time bro.
- Time bro.

26
00:01:13,992 --> 00:01:15,243
Hey, babe, something's wrong.

27
00:01:15,326 --> 00:01:17,412
I can't set jump coordinates. Can you...

28
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:19,455
[Gideon] I'm afraid my jump drive
was damaged

29
00:01:19,539 --> 00:01:22,083
when Mr. Constantine
magicked us across the universe.

30
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:24,270
Well, I guess we're going
to have to take the long way.

31
00:01:24,294 --> 00:01:26,094
[Gideon] Calculating the most
efficient route.

32
00:01:26,379 --> 00:01:29,549
Taking into consideration the
Waverider's fuel and energy reserves,

33
00:01:29,632 --> 00:01:33,177
we should arrive safely in three weeks,
two days and 21 hours.

34
00:01:33,261 --> 00:01:34,762
Stuck on the ship for three weeks?

35
00:01:34,846 --> 00:01:36,139
[Mick] I'll be in my room.

36
00:01:36,639 --> 00:01:38,891
When we land on Earth, wake me up.

37
00:01:39,309 --> 00:01:41,936
These damn eggs
are making my head itchy.

38
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:45,857
I'll bring you
some cocoa butter for that.

39
00:01:46,691 --> 00:01:48,943
And I have a great way to pass the time.

40
00:01:49,027 --> 00:01:50,862
It's this super fun role-playing game.

41
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:52,864
It's called <i>Beast/Slayers.</i>

42
00:01:53,573 --> 00:01:55,700
A Gothic mystery adventure awaits.

43
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:57,910
Well, we have a wedding
we have to plan.

44
00:01:57,994 --> 00:01:59,996
Yeah, we've so much to plan.
We just...

45
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,789
We're very busy.

46
00:02:01,873 --> 00:02:05,835
Okay. I'll just set it up
in case you guys change your mind.

47
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:12,800
[theme music playing]

48
00:02:27,357 --> 00:02:28,483
[Agent Sharpe] Okay.

49
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:30,735
I have everything organized by category.

50
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,403
Hmm. Wow.

51
00:02:32,487 --> 00:02:34,614
Yep. This is... This is thorough.

52
00:02:34,697 --> 00:02:37,575
We've got group A,
those who need to come, obviously.

53
00:02:38,368 --> 00:02:41,829
Group B, those who we would love
to come, but if they can't, it's okay.

54
00:02:41,913 --> 00:02:43,247
And... Come on.

55
00:02:43,331 --> 00:02:45,976
Group C are the people that we should
definitely send an invitation to

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,835
and pray that they RSVP "no."

57
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:51,631
What about Group D?

58
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:55,760
Yeah, well, those are the people
who it might be better that

59
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:58,513
they don't know we're getting married
until it's too late.

60
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,974
Why is Barry Allen on this list?
I love Barry.

61
00:03:02,058 --> 00:03:03,434
I know you do, babe,

62
00:03:03,518 --> 00:03:05,079
but you know that
if Barry and Iris show up,

63
00:03:05,103 --> 00:03:06,479
there is a 100% chance

64
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:09,232
that our special day will be blown up
by a super-villain, so,

65
00:03:09,315 --> 00:03:10,650
- Group D.
- Okay.

66
00:03:11,317 --> 00:03:13,778
- [monitor trilling]
- Hold on a second.

67
00:03:14,529 --> 00:03:16,823
Gideon, why is our trip getting longer?

68
00:03:17,156 --> 00:03:18,825
[Gideon] I've recalculated the duration

69
00:03:18,908 --> 00:03:21,119
based on our current level
of power consumption.

70
00:03:22,078 --> 00:03:23,579
Power consumption?

71
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,207
[grunting on video game]

72
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,209
No, you will not survive this.

73
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:29,460
Oh, I'll survive.

74
00:03:29,544 --> 00:03:31,587
- Deadly combo coming at you.
- No. No.

75
00:03:31,671 --> 00:03:32,629
Ha!

76
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:35,026
[Nate] Wait, wait. No, no, I'm not out.
I'm not out. I'm not...

77
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:36,342
Hey!

78
00:03:36,426 --> 00:03:38,821
Sorry, kiddos. We gotta conserve power
or we're never gonna get home.

79
00:03:38,845 --> 00:03:40,096
So no screen time?

80
00:03:41,514 --> 00:03:42,514
Afraid so.

81
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:43,975
I got you, Captain.

82
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:45,643
No power, no problem.

83
00:03:46,185 --> 00:03:47,895
Right, who's next?

84
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:51,399
Gideon, I would like a prime rib,

85
00:03:51,482 --> 00:03:53,985
medium rare, with shoestring fries
and béarnaise and...

86
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,611
Ah, ah, ah. Gideon, scrap that order.

87
00:03:55,695 --> 00:03:57,905
Sorry, you can't use
the food fabricator anymore.

88
00:03:57,989 --> 00:03:59,741
How are we supposed to feed ourselves?

89
00:03:59,824 --> 00:04:01,451
I don't know.

90
00:04:01,534 --> 00:04:02,618
Oh, look.

91
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:04,662
Food.

92
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:08,291
Cook it the old-fashioned way. Yummy.

93
00:04:10,418 --> 00:04:11,418
[sighs]

94
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:14,130
How does that robe fit you, love?

95
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:16,841
- [Zari] Actually, it's a little bit big.
- Oh, right.

96
00:04:19,844 --> 00:04:21,971
- [chanting]
- [Zari] Oh.

97
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:23,556
Wow, it's perfect now.

98
00:04:26,684 --> 00:04:27,852
[groans]

99
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:40,698
[sighs]

100
00:04:47,413 --> 00:04:48,664
[Behrad] You all right, man?

101
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:53,628
Aces all round, squire. Aces all round.

102
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:55,880
I feel magnificent.

103
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:57,381
How do you feel, good?

104
00:04:57,465 --> 00:04:59,008
Oh... [shudders]

105
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:02,136
- [Zari] Mmm.
- Oh, wow.

106
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,971
- Yeah.
- Oh, hello, Brother.

107
00:05:04,055 --> 00:05:05,681
John is taking me on a spa date.

108
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:07,350
Ah, on the ship?

109
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:08,935
Oh, ye of little faith.

110
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:11,687
You see, I've finally got my magic back
and no occasion to use it

111
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:14,232
save for doting on
that delightful deity.

112
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:17,985
Relaxation awaits.

113
00:05:27,537 --> 00:05:30,498
Deep breaths as you fire up
that back leg.

114
00:05:30,957 --> 00:05:33,334
[groans] Steel is not flexible.

115
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:35,294
Inhale, extend.

116
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:39,173
Exhale, goddess pose.

117
00:05:39,966 --> 00:05:41,259
Oh, I missed this.

118
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:45,888
I'll take the positivity
into my energy sphere with gratitude.

119
00:05:46,973 --> 00:05:48,391
Room for an English one?

120
00:05:48,975 --> 00:05:50,911
- We're kind of in the middle of a...
- Of course.

121
00:05:50,935 --> 00:05:53,354
Prepare yourself for total relaxation.

122
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:57,483
Yeah. [inhales sharply]

123
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,779
The atmosphere could do with
a bit of upgrade, though, couldn't it?

124
00:06:02,238 --> 00:06:04,574
[chanting]

125
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:15,126
Wow. Now that is how you set the mood.

126
00:06:15,835 --> 00:06:19,171
Whew! What, did you raise it 20 degrees
in here? I'm beginning to schvitz.

127
00:06:19,964 --> 00:06:22,633
- [exhales]
- Guess we're doing hot yoga.

128
00:06:23,551 --> 00:06:26,554
But in the interest of preserving
the sanctity of this practice,

129
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:27,948
I ask that you keep your pants on.

130
00:06:27,972 --> 00:06:30,612
Well, in the interest of achieving
a higher state of consciousness,

131
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:32,852
I must bare myself to the elements.

132
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:34,186
Come on, B, you know how he is.

133
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:37,148
Sure, but I'd rather not know
all of him right now, okay?

134
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:40,902
I thought that you, of all people,
would, you know, go with the flow.

135
00:06:40,985 --> 00:06:43,779
The flow was my flow
till you came and hijacked it.

136
00:06:43,863 --> 00:06:45,948
Hijacked it? Improved it, you mean.

137
00:06:46,032 --> 00:06:47,617
Do you know what? This is bollocks.

138
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,745
Well, I'm gonna go practice
somewhere more welcoming.

139
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:51,913
- Cheers.
- [Zari] Behrad.

140
00:06:51,996 --> 00:06:52,912
[speaking in Arabic]

141
00:06:52,914 --> 00:06:56,334
- Don't Mom voice me, Zari.
- Guys, guys, just take a breath.

142
00:06:56,584 --> 00:06:57,710
[inhales slowly]

143
00:06:57,793 --> 00:06:59,795
You're right. This is a safe space.

144
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:02,048
- John, you can stay.
- No, no.

145
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:04,884
No, the mood's all wrong now, mate.

146
00:07:08,638 --> 00:07:09,638
[Zari] John?

147
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:13,559
Well, if that is the issue

148
00:07:13,643 --> 00:07:15,829
then why did you put your fake
actor parents in Group A?

149
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:19,065
Whoa, whoa, I have very fond memories
of them that feel real and I...

150
00:07:19,148 --> 00:07:21,609
Well, Black Siren
is my sister Laurel from another...

151
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:23,003
[Constantine]...a prick in
a dartboard, all right?

152
00:07:23,027 --> 00:07:25,905
I know when I'm not wanted,
and I'm not going to outstay my welcome.

153
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:28,091
John, don't be so dramatic.
Go back there and make amends.

154
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:30,218
- He didn't mean what he said.
- [Sara] Whoa, hold on.

155
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:31,242
What is the drama?

156
00:07:31,619 --> 00:07:32,954
[sighs] Tensions are very high.

157
00:07:33,037 --> 00:07:34,538
People are feeling very prickly.

158
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,874
How is this already happening?
It's day three.

159
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:39,043
It is very stressful
being cooped up on a Timeship.

160
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:40,962
Worse. It's bloody boring.

161
00:07:41,045 --> 00:07:42,481
Yeah. Without technology to distract us

162
00:07:42,505 --> 00:07:44,385
it's only gonna get worse
before it gets better.

163
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:45,716
We need an activity.

164
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:48,302
Something to bring us together,

165
00:07:48,386 --> 00:07:49,595
like a mission,

166
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:50,930
but not a mission.

167
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,849
Like a game.

168
00:07:58,187 --> 00:08:03,401
Welcome to the world of <i>Beast/Slayers.</i>

169
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:06,946
In this Gothic adventure, you will
enter a mansion for a dinner party,

170
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:10,574
only to be hunted by a horrendous beast.

171
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:11,885
Oh, I see what's happening here.

172
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:14,286
It's like <i>Mafia.</i>
One of us is secretly the Beast,

173
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:17,307
and it's up to the rest of us to figure
it out before it's too late. Go ahead.

174
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:19,041
After each kill, you will deliberate

175
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:21,752
on who to accuse
of being the horrendous monster.

176
00:08:21,836 --> 00:08:22,752
[both mouthing]

177
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:26,465
Accuse correctly,
the Beast dies and the humans win.

178
00:08:26,549 --> 00:08:28,551
And if we accuse incorrectly?

179
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:33,681
Well, then the game continues
and it's the Beast's turn to strike!

180
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:36,934
[laughs]

181
00:08:37,018 --> 00:08:39,854
I'll be the all-knowing narrator
who will usher the game along.

182
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:44,025
Meanwhile, you will each need
to select a character and a card.

183
00:08:44,108 --> 00:08:45,234
Ooh, can I go first?

184
00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:49,113
Mmm... Eccentric Detective.

185
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,284
Hmm. Black Widow.

186
00:08:54,452 --> 00:08:55,494
[all chuckling]

187
00:08:56,037 --> 00:08:57,496
Starving Artist.

188
00:08:57,913 --> 00:08:59,498
Wealthy Foreigner.

189
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:04,003
[clears throat] "Reluctant Soothsayer."
Typecast much?

190
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:06,088
Big Game Hunter. I'll take it.

191
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,007
Hmm. Prima Donna. Obvious.

192
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:11,969
A Consumptive Doctor. Original.

193
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:13,095
Oh.

194
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:18,184
All right. Now, keep each
of these cards secret.

195
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:22,188
They either say "Human"
or they say "Beast."

196
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:24,315
Know who and what you are...

197
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:27,026
as we begin.

198
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:29,820
[imitates wind howling]

199
00:09:32,907 --> 00:09:36,035
[in Dracula voice]
It's a dark and stormy night,

200
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:41,957
as a group of strangers are summoned
to the home of a rich and powerful Lord.

201
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,335
All right, enough of this. [sighs]

202
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,296
All right, so everybody
wants to go on an adventure, right?

203
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:49,965
Well, let's go on a real adventure,
shall we?

204
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,344
[chanting]

205
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:05,397
Now that's more like it.

206
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:12,488
Game on. Let's hunt this Beast.

207
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:17,785
[thunder cracks]

208
00:10:18,077 --> 00:10:19,245
What?

209
00:10:19,912 --> 00:10:22,998
You have got to teach me
the spell, John.

210
00:10:23,082 --> 00:10:26,335
Yeah, well, it takes the bored
out of board game, doesn't it?

211
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:28,003
This is so incredibly realistic

212
00:10:28,087 --> 00:10:31,841
and I cannot wait to win...
[in British accent] this entire game.

213
00:10:32,383 --> 00:10:36,262
Well, I, for one, did not consent
to be magicked into a game.

214
00:10:36,345 --> 00:10:39,849
Oh, come on. Would you really rather
play with Gary making sound effects?

215
00:10:39,932 --> 00:10:41,100
[Gary imitating wind howling]

216
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:44,019
Okay, I got to admit, John,
this is pretty impressive.

217
00:10:44,103 --> 00:10:45,771
But why does it look like your house?

218
00:10:45,855 --> 00:10:48,399
Well, the spell is linked
to the rules of the game,

219
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:51,569
but the rest of the gaps
are filled in by my imagination.

220
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:53,487
It's easy to make a place
I know so well.

221
00:10:53,571 --> 00:10:56,740
Now, once we win and the game ends...

222
00:10:57,074 --> 00:10:58,325
Poof!

223
00:10:58,409 --> 00:11:00,703
...we'll all be back in the ship,
right as rain.

224
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:02,037
[thunder cracks]

225
00:11:02,121 --> 00:11:03,122
Hello?

226
00:11:04,874 --> 00:11:05,875
Guys?

227
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:10,671
You all right in there?

228
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:15,092
All right, Gary,
they're counting on you to narrate.

229
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:20,222
[suspenseful music playing]

230
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:23,475
[in Dracula voice] Okay, everyone,

231
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:28,230
[echoing] <i>dinner is served.</i>

232
00:11:30,274 --> 00:11:32,735
- [tense classical music playing]
- Whew!

233
00:11:44,455 --> 00:11:47,875
So, Detective,
could we figure out who this Beast is?

234
00:11:48,334 --> 00:11:49,960
It's all about the first kill.

235
00:11:50,044 --> 00:11:52,129
Once the Beast strikes,
there will be a clear line

236
00:11:52,213 --> 00:11:54,173
from who's chosen to who's guilty.

237
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:56,926
I've already mapped out who it could be
based on who dies first.

238
00:11:58,469 --> 00:11:59,511
Hey, John.

239
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:01,388
This chicken smells delicious.

240
00:12:01,764 --> 00:12:03,909
But seriously, babe,
do you think he'd cater at the wedding?

241
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:05,267
- There's no wedding talk.
- What?

242
00:12:05,351 --> 00:12:09,521
[in French accent] I do not know
what you're talking about, Detective,

243
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:13,567
because I am just
a heartbroken, sad widow.

244
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:16,069
You know I don't drink.

245
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:18,280
Yeah, but this isn't real, mate.

246
00:12:18,364 --> 00:12:19,925
This may be your
one and only opportunity

247
00:12:19,949 --> 00:12:23,035
to try a truly exquisite Bordeaux.

248
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:24,679
[in sing-song voice] I'll have some.

249
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,997
- No, she won't.
- Yes, she will. It's not real.

250
00:12:36,048 --> 00:12:37,716
Don't be jealous, Gare.

251
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:40,386
You're a vital part of this adventure.

252
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:42,388
[alarm blaring]

253
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:44,974
Gideon, what's that?

254
00:12:45,057 --> 00:12:47,977
[Gideon] I'm receiving a distress beacon
from an approaching vessel.

255
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:50,688
[alarm continues]

256
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:57,736
Who the hell's making that racket?
I'm trying to concentrate on my puzzles.

257
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,155
We're being hailed by someone
who's lost out in space.

258
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:02,950
Oh, my God, your hair.

259
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:05,661
It grew overnight.

260
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:07,997
Well, don't tuck it in. It's beautiful.

261
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,766
It's a sign
you're in your fourth quadmester.

262
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,458
It means the babies are healthy.

263
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:13,085
I recognize that ship.

264
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:16,171
Bishop the psycho might be on board
and those damn lizard people.

265
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:18,048
Gideon, blast.

266
00:13:18,132 --> 00:13:20,592
[Gideon] I'm under Captains' orders
not to use any systems

267
00:13:20,676 --> 00:13:22,469
not vital for our transport to Earth.

268
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,763
- Where are the captains?
- They're in my game.

269
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:27,850
Well, if the captains aren't here,
it makes me captain.

270
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:29,977
Well, I don't think
that's how that works.

271
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,731
[Gideon] The ship is maneuvering into
docking position on our starboard side.

272
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:35,941
Damn it. We missed our shot.

273
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:39,653
[Gideon] Docking complete.

274
00:13:39,737 --> 00:13:42,865
I urge you to reserve judgment until
we know exactly who's behind that door.

275
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:44,325
- Shut up!
- [door rattles]

276
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:46,660
Whatever comes through that door,
I'm killing.

277
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,874
[dramatic music playing]

278
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:01,550
Kayla!

279
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:03,594
Hey, dummies.

280
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:05,220
You miss me?

281
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:14,897
- [thunder cracks]
- [all exclaiming]

282
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:16,398
[Spooner] What is happening?

283
00:14:16,482 --> 00:14:20,069
[Nate] Ooh, it's time.
The Beast will choose its first victim.

284
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:24,447
Ooh!

285
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:25,616
- [all exclaiming]
- [gasps]

286
00:14:26,367 --> 00:14:27,826
- No.
- Dead.

287
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,203
[inaudible]

288
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,914
- What?
- [inaudible]

289
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:34,249
The dead have no voice. How poetic.

290
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:36,502
Well, that was pretty tame.

291
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:40,172
Oh, well, Behrad, see? It's all pretend.

292
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:45,302
I'm sorry, babe, but you're out.
You got to go.

293
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:47,471
I know.

294
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:49,890
[in French accent] I will miss you
and mourn you.

295
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:52,559
So we lost the detective.

296
00:14:52,643 --> 00:14:55,145
She was the only one
who could figure this whole thing out.

297
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:58,190
And now, well, she's gone.

298
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,984
[thunder cracks]

299
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:06,490
All right, y'all, the Beast had
their fun, and now it's our turn.

300
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:07,884
All right, take it easy, Spooner.

301
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:09,576
Games like these, it's up to the group

302
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,703
to deliberate on
who we think the Beast is.

303
00:15:11,787 --> 00:15:15,416
And then it's up to all of us
to vote on someone to accuse.

304
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:18,377
- Well, I accuse you!
- [Nate] No.

305
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:22,589
I think that you were so impressed
with Ava's methodology

306
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:26,802
that you wanted to eliminate
the competition right from the start.

307
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:27,802
[gasps and spits]

308
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:30,889
Or it's you and you're quick
to accuse others

309
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:32,558
to deflect any suspicion.

310
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:34,518
Just pick me.
I'll gladly go hang with Ava

311
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,162
and be exempt from decisions like these.

312
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:37,938
No, no, no. I agree with Sara.

313
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:39,416
I think it's...
[in sing-song voice] Nate.

314
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,817
- Thank you.
- What? Guys, besides Gary,

315
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,611
who has been very quiet, by the way,

316
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:47,531
I'm the only one who has any idea
how to play this game.

317
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,783
Yeah, not exactly, mate.

318
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:51,994
We'll be fine without you,
don't you worry.

319
00:15:52,077 --> 00:15:54,329
All right, so do we vote on Nate?

320
00:15:54,413 --> 00:15:56,248
- All in favor?
- [Sara] Mmm-hmm.

321
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:57,958
I abstain.

322
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,043
Doesn't matter. We don't need him.

323
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:02,337
You have been accused!

324
00:16:03,422 --> 00:16:05,090
[wolf howling]

325
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:06,216
[knife whooshing]

326
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,219
- [screams]
- [gasps]

327
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:12,764
[thunder cracks]

328
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:16,726
He's dead.

329
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:21,857
No, no, trust me, he is fine.
All right? Nate is fine.

330
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,860
Dude, he literally just got
stabbed in the back. He's not fine.

331
00:16:26,445 --> 00:16:27,645
- [Astra grunts]
- [Zari gasps]

332
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:31,700
Oh, that is awful. Is that supposed
to happen? It's really graphic.

333
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,702
John, what has changed?

334
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:36,455
Why is Nate's death
so different from Ava's?

335
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:37,538
Why are you asking me?

336
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:39,935
If you got a problem with the game,
you go talk to that geek, Gary.

337
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,460
He's the one who picked it.

338
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:43,795
I just made it into a proper experience.

339
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:46,006
[stifling a cough]

340
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,509
- [coughs]
- [Zari] John.

341
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:53,055
- [gasps] Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

342
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:55,265
No, he's becoming his character.

343
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:56,683
Consumptive doctor.

344
00:16:56,767 --> 00:17:01,063
What if the longer the game goes on,
the more realistic it becomes?

345
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:04,149
And is anyone else starting
to feel more like their character?

346
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:06,693
I feel like shooting something,
but that's normal.

347
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:08,338
Yeah, I wouldn't be able to tell either.

348
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:10,572
Prima Donna... [gasps]

349
00:17:10,906 --> 00:17:14,451
I do feel extra dramatic
and quite squeamish.

350
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:17,162
What about you?
Are you hungry, Starving Artist?

351
00:17:17,246 --> 00:17:20,290
Turns out seeing my best friend's
dead body is an appetite killer, so...

352
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:22,542
I'm gonna be sick.

353
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:28,298
All right, well, I am definitely feeling
the loss of my beloved Ava...

354
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:31,718
If we all are becoming
more like our characters

355
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:33,512
and Ava was the first one to die, then...

356
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:34,595
[Behrad screams]

357
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:36,557
Ava!

358
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:39,142
No, no, no.

359
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:41,270
Ava!

360
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,022
Ava? No, no, no. This is wrong.

361
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:46,108
This is... Damn it, John!

362
00:17:46,525 --> 00:17:49,403
This has gone too far.
I'm putting an end to this.

363
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:50,737
Look, I'm the...

364
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:52,656
[thunder cracks]

365
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:55,158
[blood squelching]

366
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:08,922
- [gasps and screams]
- [coughing]

367
00:18:09,214 --> 00:18:10,382
Was Sara about to confess?

368
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:12,443
- No. She was gonna take out her card.
- [Behrad] That's it.

369
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:13,677
Everyone, show your card.

370
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:16,888
- Blank.
- Blank.

371
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:18,932
- Blank.
- [sobbing] Blank.

372
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:20,683
Blank.

373
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,275
Is hers blank as well?

374
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:29,359
No.

375
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:31,152
It's worse.

376
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:37,451
I don't think that putting a Band-Aid
on my wound makes us even.

377
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:39,286
I'm just trying to help.

378
00:18:40,037 --> 00:18:42,331
[laughs] Oh, now you care
about my well-being.

379
00:18:42,414 --> 00:18:44,041
- I'll be fine.
- You don't look fine.

380
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,335
I mean, you always look fine.

381
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:48,545
We have a machine that can fix that.

382
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:50,297
I'm just here for my ship.

383
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,757
Well, your ship's not here.

384
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:53,634
Then where is it?

385
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:56,345
I reverse-tracked my pod detector
and it led me here.

386
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:58,930
That tech should have been on my ship.

387
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,850
But I guess you guys are thieves
as well as deserters.

388
00:19:02,351 --> 00:19:04,162
So what did you do
with the rest of my ship, huh?

389
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:05,186
It's on Earth.

390
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:07,481
And funny enough,
we're traveling there now.

391
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:08,815
We can give you a lift.

392
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:12,110
But in the meantime,
let us patch that up, hmm?

393
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:22,663
What happened to her tentacle?

394
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:24,748
[Kayla clicking]

395
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:26,500
Zaguron stung her.

396
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,461
She had to amputate
to prevent the poison from spreading.

397
00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:33,507
Poor Lefty.

398
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,550
Lefty? The tentacle has a name?

399
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:37,010
Sure it does.

400
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:38,637
Our tentacles are regenerative,

401
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,040
so they're part of us
but they're also their own creatures.

402
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:43,642
Kind of like starfish arms
or earthworms.

403
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:45,936
[speaking alien language]

404
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:47,979
Uh, she wants to know what you're doing.

405
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:49,773
[beeps]

406
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,608
Starting up the meat printer.

407
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:53,485
She'll have a new Lefty in no time.

408
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:00,575
[speaking alien language]

409
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:05,122
- Oh, that's the time to destination.
- [speaking alien language]

410
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:07,290
Because we printed you a new tentacle.

411
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:09,394
- [speaking alien language]
- The jump drive is broken.

412
00:20:09,418 --> 00:20:11,354
Why do you think we're
traveling the old-fashioned way?

413
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:13,880
[beeping]

414
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:26,184
All fixed. Time to go back to your ship.

415
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:28,145
Or you could show me
where your mainframe is

416
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:29,813
and I'll fix your jump drive.

417
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:32,774
And then we can all get what we want
a hell of a lot quicker.

418
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:33,859
Deal?

419
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:35,484
[Mick] Deal.

420
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:41,158
How did you get off the planet?

421
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:43,034
I thought you were dead.

422
00:20:43,118 --> 00:20:44,745
- If I...
- [Kayla] If what?

423
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:46,830
You thought I was alive?

424
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:48,832
You didn't stick around
long enough to find out.

425
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:52,085
In fact, you bolted
the second you got onto my ship.

426
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:54,963
Yes, you're right.

427
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:57,215
I'm sorry.

428
00:20:58,383 --> 00:20:59,384
Oh, wow.

429
00:20:59,468 --> 00:21:00,552
An apology.

430
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:03,472
That sounded like that took some effort.

431
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:05,932
You know what else took some effort?

432
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:08,643
Battling my way through
a Zaguron-infested planet.

433
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:11,146
You know Zagurons are carrion creatures?

434
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:14,441
They will swarm a dying planet
and pick it to pieces like that.

435
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:15,524
[snaps fingers]

436
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:16,942
They were relentless,

437
00:21:17,652 --> 00:21:19,571
but I was stronger.

438
00:21:21,531 --> 00:21:24,451
With some time, I finally got
Bishop's habitat airborne again.

439
00:21:25,035 --> 00:21:27,078
Never imagined I'd run into you bozos.

440
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:30,457
As soon as I get my ship back,
I'll be a dozen galaxies away from here

441
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,334
and forget that any of you ever existed.

442
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:35,170
- Kayla, there's something I have to...
- [Gary] Hey, Mick. Uh...

443
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:38,632
Can I please get your hand
over here with something?

444
00:21:43,762 --> 00:21:44,762
[Mick] What?

445
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:47,814
[whispering] Don't tell Kayla
you're pregnant.

446
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:51,311
If she finds out, she may perform
the Necrian love grip.

447
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:52,394
[Mick] What?

448
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:55,857
[Gary] Males in my species
are subservient.

449
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:57,025
[Mick] Of course they are.

450
00:21:57,108 --> 00:21:59,903
If she finds that you're an
unfit parent, or she doesn't like you,

451
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:03,156
she could knock you out
and eat your eggy brains.

452
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:08,078
Please keep an eye on her and...

453
00:22:09,538 --> 00:22:13,208
remember, do not trust her.

454
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,970
- [thunder cracking]
- [gun cocks]

455
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:26,137
All right.

456
00:22:26,221 --> 00:22:27,889
Hunt's on. One of you did this.

457
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:31,768
What are you gonna do, shoot us all
till one of us is the Beast?

458
00:22:31,852 --> 00:22:34,354
How do you even know
one of us is the Beast? [whimpers]

459
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:35,981
What if it was Sara?

460
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:37,440
Then what killed her?

461
00:22:37,524 --> 00:22:40,652
And if Sara was the Beast,
this game should be over.

462
00:22:40,735 --> 00:22:42,529
What step are we even on anymore?

463
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:43,612
[coughing]

464
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:46,701
That's a Gary question, love.
The rules are all bloody rubbish to me.

465
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:49,828
Maybe you should have learned them
before trapping us in this nightmare.

466
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:53,206
You think I'm enjoying this, squire?

467
00:22:54,124 --> 00:22:56,459
You know, if the Beast doesn't off me,
the bloody TB will.

468
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:59,355
But you know what? I'm the one that's
gonna get us all out of here, all right?

469
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:00,379
So, sit back.

470
00:23:02,507 --> 00:23:03,507
Next.

471
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:05,635
Deadly nitrate.

472
00:23:06,511 --> 00:23:07,679
In you go.

473
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,224
Pulverized whale bone.

474
00:23:11,683 --> 00:23:12,683
Mmm.

475
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:15,979
And just a little booze
to make it all sing.

476
00:23:18,732 --> 00:23:19,983
[inhales sharply]

477
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:23,402
Bottoms up.

478
00:23:26,656 --> 00:23:27,657
Ugh.

479
00:23:29,784 --> 00:23:32,203
[chanting]

480
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:39,044
[groaning]

481
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,170
- [Zari] John, are you okay?
- [Constantine] Yeah.

482
00:23:41,254 --> 00:23:42,422
[Zari] There you go.

483
00:23:42,756 --> 00:23:43,840
[coughs]

484
00:23:44,716 --> 00:23:46,635
I'm fine. [groans]

485
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:51,056
I guess the game won't allow us
to take a shortcut, so...

486
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:53,350
we just have to play.

487
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:55,727
- And win.
- And if we lose?

488
00:23:57,562 --> 00:23:59,105
What do you mean "if we lose"?

489
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:01,107
There are two outcomes to this game.

490
00:24:01,566 --> 00:24:04,569
And one, the humans win
by killing the Beast.

491
00:24:04,653 --> 00:24:06,696
And the other,
the Beast kills all the humans

492
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,156
and the game keeps going.

493
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:11,952
Characters get redealt
and the game goes on and on and on.

494
00:24:12,577 --> 00:24:15,830
You mean we could be
trapped in here forever.

495
00:24:20,335 --> 00:24:21,962
Time to play offense.

496
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:25,340
If we're all becoming our characters,
then maybe I can use my powers

497
00:24:25,423 --> 00:24:27,884
as a soothsayer
to figure out who the Beast is.

498
00:24:27,968 --> 00:24:29,636
Everyone, circle up.

499
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:40,271
With my power as the oracle,
I demand to know.

500
00:24:41,982 --> 00:24:44,234
Beast, where are you?

501
00:24:45,318 --> 00:24:46,444
Speak through me.

502
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:51,282
[wind howling]

503
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:57,205
[as The Beast] I am here.

504
00:24:57,288 --> 00:24:59,165
I am one of you.

505
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:01,668
I will win.

506
00:25:02,377 --> 00:25:05,130
Your blood will smear the walls.

507
00:25:05,213 --> 00:25:07,590
Your screams will fill the air.

508
00:25:08,591 --> 00:25:10,593
Forever here,

509
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:12,554
forever mine.

510
00:25:13,096 --> 00:25:14,639
Forever!

511
00:25:15,306 --> 00:25:16,433
[Astra gasps]

512
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:20,770
Oh, to hell with this!

513
00:25:28,486 --> 00:25:30,864
I'm finding another way
out of this dumpster fire.

514
00:25:30,947 --> 00:25:34,200
And if any of you all come after me,
I'll blow your head off.

515
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:36,578
Except you. I trust you.

516
00:25:37,412 --> 00:25:39,080
[in normal voice] Likewise. Let's go.

517
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:42,666
[Behrad] Wait.

518
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:44,169
Where are you going?

519
00:25:44,252 --> 00:25:46,588
Splitting up is a cardinal
sin to survival.

520
00:25:46,671 --> 00:25:48,381
And creativity!

521
00:25:52,844 --> 00:25:54,054
Let's try this door.

522
00:25:58,558 --> 00:25:59,559
[door opens]

523
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:03,563
Okay, so we're passing
the conservatory now.

524
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:07,901
- Into the dining room?
- This is exhausting.

525
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:10,070
All these doors circle back
into the house.

526
00:26:11,613 --> 00:26:12,739
[thunder cracks]

527
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:17,160
[clears throat]

528
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:19,953
Ahem!

529
00:26:26,461 --> 00:26:28,439
- [whispering] What?
- I'm worried about Astra and Spooner.

530
00:26:28,463 --> 00:26:29,774
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna bring them back here.

531
00:26:29,798 --> 00:26:30,900
- Okay.
- Keep an eye on John.

532
00:26:30,924 --> 00:26:31,840
Yeah, that's what I'm doing.

533
00:26:31,841 --> 00:26:34,261
I mean, keep an eye on him
in a defensive way.

534
00:26:34,344 --> 00:26:37,514
- Here.
- You can't be serious.

535
00:26:37,597 --> 00:26:39,766
I'm a starving artist.
I'm nothing but serious.

536
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:42,078
He can barely walk. I'm more
of a danger to him than he is to me.

537
00:26:42,102 --> 00:26:43,102
Just take it!

538
00:26:48,608 --> 00:26:49,859
[coughing]

539
00:26:50,318 --> 00:26:51,402
Hey. Hey.

540
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:53,339
- It's all right. It's gonna be okay.
- [groans]

541
00:26:53,363 --> 00:26:55,281
I'm sorry I got you into this, love.

542
00:26:55,365 --> 00:26:57,408
Hey, you didn't know
this was gonna happen.

543
00:26:57,492 --> 00:26:58,618
[coughing]

544
00:26:58,701 --> 00:27:00,203
I'm gonna get you some water, okay?

545
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,001
[groans]

546
00:27:24,018 --> 00:27:25,145
[ice clinks]

547
00:27:31,192 --> 00:27:32,986
[wind whooshes]

548
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:37,699
Behrad? Is that you?

549
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,493
[floorboard creaks softly]

550
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:51,421
[tense music playing]

551
00:28:01,389 --> 00:28:02,849
A kitchen. That's new.

552
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:05,018
Yes, we could try the back door.

553
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:07,979
[Spooner] Come on, come on!

554
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:11,149
You've got to be kidding me.

555
00:28:11,232 --> 00:28:13,568
No, no, no.
This cannot be happening!

556
00:28:14,235 --> 00:28:15,445
[Spooner] Screw this.

557
00:28:15,862 --> 00:28:17,697
- [yells]
- [The Beast growls]

558
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,705
[Astra and Spooner screaming]

559
00:28:26,915 --> 00:28:28,875
[thunder cracks]

560
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:32,879
- What happened?
- Don't go in there.

561
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:35,715
Spooner and Astra...

562
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:38,467
[door creaks]

563
00:28:40,345 --> 00:28:41,429
Oh!

564
00:28:42,305 --> 00:28:43,932
[thunder cracks]

565
00:28:48,978 --> 00:28:50,021
Where's John?

566
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:57,946
Spooner and Astra are dead.

567
00:28:58,029 --> 00:28:59,072
I know it was you.

568
00:28:59,155 --> 00:29:00,782
Nice tactic, sunshine.

569
00:29:00,865 --> 00:29:02,784
But I lost track of you
just before the attack.

570
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:04,953
So did Zari. Didn't you, love?

571
00:29:05,036 --> 00:29:07,372
I actually saw Behrad find them.

572
00:29:08,122 --> 00:29:09,749
You saw him find them?
Or you saw him

573
00:29:09,832 --> 00:29:11,602
after he found them,
maybe after he killed them?

574
00:29:11,626 --> 00:29:13,086
All of this is your fault.

575
00:29:13,169 --> 00:29:15,171
There you go again,
blaming the bloody magic.

576
00:29:15,255 --> 00:29:17,048
I'm not blaming the bloody magic,
John.

577
00:29:17,131 --> 00:29:18,549
I'm blaming you for abusing it.

578
00:29:18,633 --> 00:29:21,219
You just had to go and show off
your fancy new Fountain powers...

579
00:29:21,302 --> 00:29:22,302
Jealous, are we?

580
00:29:22,303 --> 00:29:24,515
Well, add that
to your petulant brattiness...

581
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:26,933
[vocalizing operatically]

582
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:28,726
Stop acting like children.

583
00:29:30,103 --> 00:29:31,271
I think he's the Beast.

584
00:29:31,354 --> 00:29:33,540
I've been coughing my bloody lungs up
for the last two hours.

585
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:35,834
How can you still think that
I'm the one that killed our friends?

586
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:38,653
I'm not saying how you did it.
I'm saying I know you did it.

587
00:29:38,736 --> 00:29:39,694
Okay, so let's vote.

588
00:29:39,696 --> 00:29:41,948
- I vote that it's you.
- And I vote it's you.

589
00:29:43,491 --> 00:29:45,159
Don't make me choose between you.

590
00:29:45,994 --> 00:29:48,746
All right. Do you know what?
I will do you both a favor.

591
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,665
I'm gonna go
and lock myself in the attic

592
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:54,836
because clearly I am some unhinged,
egotistical bloody maniac!

593
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:57,213
- John, just... [groans in frustration]
- [coughing]

594
00:29:58,464 --> 00:29:59,464
Thanks.

595
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:16,774
[sniffs]

596
00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:23,906
[Gary] Gideon, what's with
all the energy usage?

597
00:30:24,282 --> 00:30:27,160
[Gideon] The device that Mr. Rory
refers to as the "meat printer"

598
00:30:27,243 --> 00:30:29,579
is drawing a considerable
amount of power.

599
00:30:47,472 --> 00:30:49,390
Lefty, no!

600
00:30:49,474 --> 00:30:50,600
[beeps]

601
00:30:50,725 --> 00:30:52,101
What are you printing?

602
00:30:52,643 --> 00:30:53,728
[gasps]

603
00:30:54,145 --> 00:30:55,188
Lefty.

604
00:30:55,271 --> 00:30:57,023
Calm down, Lefty. Don't... [grunts]

605
00:30:59,108 --> 00:31:00,360
[beeps]

606
00:31:01,652 --> 00:31:03,613
Gideon, is the ship ready to jump?

607
00:31:03,696 --> 00:31:05,948
[Gideon] The jump drive
is fully operational, Mr. Rory.

608
00:31:06,032 --> 00:31:07,158
But there is trouble.

609
00:31:07,241 --> 00:31:09,369
Mr. Green is under attack
in the Med Bay.

610
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:11,245
Attack? By who?

611
00:31:17,251 --> 00:31:19,253
[straining] Gotcha!

612
00:31:19,337 --> 00:31:20,380
[exclaims]

613
00:31:22,382 --> 00:31:23,382
[grunts]

614
00:31:23,674 --> 00:31:24,674
What are you doing?

615
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:27,178
Why are you doing this?

616
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,763
Because you left me.

617
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:30,639
And he got me out.

618
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:32,517
I owe him.

619
00:31:33,851 --> 00:31:34,851
Him?

620
00:31:36,854 --> 00:31:37,897
[groans]

621
00:31:52,912 --> 00:31:53,996
I'm pregnant.

622
00:32:21,065 --> 00:32:22,442
Not the love grip!

623
00:32:35,913 --> 00:32:37,415
I don't want to die in here.

624
00:32:37,498 --> 00:32:39,500
<i>Maman</i> and <i>Baba</i> will never
know the truth about me.

625
00:32:39,876 --> 00:32:40,877
About us.

626
00:32:41,377 --> 00:32:42,420
If we get out of here,

627
00:32:42,503 --> 00:32:44,297
- I'm coming clean with them.
- Oh, please.

628
00:32:45,006 --> 00:32:47,592
Like you'd ever risk damaging
<i>Maman's</i> view of her...

629
00:32:47,717 --> 00:32:48,717
[speaking in Arabic]

630
00:32:49,093 --> 00:32:50,636
Oh. Maybe I should tell her how your

631
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,597
magician boyfriend
got you to drink wine.

632
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,680
You would not.

633
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:55,933
You're right. I wouldn't.

634
00:32:56,392 --> 00:32:58,561
But how can you not see
what John's doing here?

635
00:32:58,644 --> 00:32:59,562
He told us himself,

636
00:32:59,563 --> 00:33:01,707
he filled in the gaps of this illusion
with his own imagination.

637
00:33:01,731 --> 00:33:04,066
I mean, this is some
new level of a bad trip.

638
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,651
What is your problem with him?

639
00:33:05,735 --> 00:33:08,196
My problem is that he's being a jerk
and you're not seeing it.

640
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:10,257
Ever since he came back
from the Fountain,

641
00:33:10,281 --> 00:33:12,867
he's been acting
like an asshat jock on steroids.

642
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:15,244
Oh, working out your issues
from high school much?

643
00:33:15,328 --> 00:33:17,872
If by that you mean worrying
about your choice in men,

644
00:33:17,955 --> 00:33:18,998
then yeah, I am.

645
00:33:19,081 --> 00:33:20,291
We need to call him out.

646
00:33:20,374 --> 00:33:23,211
He's the Beast. If we vote
to accuse him, we can end this.

647
00:33:23,294 --> 00:33:24,295
- I can't.
- Why not?

648
00:33:24,378 --> 00:33:25,378
I love him.

649
00:33:29,342 --> 00:33:31,511
I've never heard you say that
about anybody before.

650
00:33:34,013 --> 00:33:36,766
Well, I've never felt it.

651
00:33:39,185 --> 00:33:40,937
I can be myself with him,

652
00:33:41,938 --> 00:33:43,940
you know, no games,
no pretense.

653
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,485
He makes me happy.

654
00:33:52,865 --> 00:33:54,283
Have you told him how you feel?

655
00:33:54,992 --> 00:33:57,245
No. No, that feels...

656
00:33:58,621 --> 00:34:03,000
very scary to be vulnerable to...

657
00:34:04,085 --> 00:34:05,836
to another person like that.

658
00:34:08,214 --> 00:34:10,758
I mean, can it even last, you know?

659
00:34:10,841 --> 00:34:12,009
You know how John is.

660
00:34:13,427 --> 00:34:14,427
Yeah, but...

661
00:34:16,305 --> 00:34:17,598
You gotta take that leap.

662
00:34:18,766 --> 00:34:20,434
Okay, now you like him again?

663
00:34:20,518 --> 00:34:21,936
I never disliked him.

664
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:25,314
I love the guy, but something
is definitely off about him.

667

[The Beast] You can end the game.

668
00:34:47,336 --> 00:34:50,339
You know how. You just can't do it.

669
00:34:51,465 --> 00:34:53,092
You won't do it.

670
00:34:54,135 --> 00:34:55,428
I've tried it.

671
00:34:55,511 --> 00:34:58,973
[The Beast] By shooting back
some magic potion No. 9?

672
00:34:59,056 --> 00:35:00,600
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

673
00:35:00,933 --> 00:35:05,605
With every sip, you make
this prison and me stronger.

674
00:35:06,564 --> 00:35:09,734
You're not in control
of the magic, John.

675
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:12,987
It's in control of you.

676
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:15,823
Just do me a favor, eh, and...

677
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:19,118
You kill me or piss off,

678
00:35:19,201 --> 00:35:20,661
because I am done playing games.

679
00:35:21,746 --> 00:35:22,955
[The Beast] No, you're not.

680
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:26,167
You love this world.

681
00:35:27,001 --> 00:35:28,544
You love the power.

682
00:35:29,712 --> 00:35:31,339
You love me.

Oh, don't look so surprised, John.

686
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:43,517
I've always been here.

687
00:35:43,601 --> 00:35:46,228
You just never looked me
in the eye before.

688
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,149
You never wanted
to confront the part of you

689
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:52,151
that sabotaged all your relationships.

690
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:55,529
Doomed your lovers.

691
00:35:56,405 --> 00:35:58,074
The game made that possible.

692
00:35:58,991 --> 00:36:01,285
It made me possible.

693
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:07,166
Gave me a playground to sow
destruction before your very eyes.

694

[The Beast growls]

Here I am.

Fueled by your new addiction

697
00:36:19,345 --> 00:36:22,598
and loving every moment of it.

698
00:36:23,015 --> 00:36:25,059
It's all tricks, lies.

699

I'll kill you, you bastard!

Or more like look at yourself.

who was none of us, somehow...

715

Bloody Gary. You know you can't give
him a lick of responsibility

00:37:21,782 --> 00:37:23,117
without him buggering it all up.

717
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,660
Okay, well, let's play again.

718

- [all] No!
- Why?

719
00:37:26,996 --> 00:37:28,372
Do you really want to die again?

720
00:37:28,456 --> 00:37:30,833
I'm not gonna die this time
because this time I'm gonna win.

721
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:34,795
Wait. You guys, are we home?

722

[Constantine] Oh, good,
because I am bloody knackered.

How long were we in that game?

What is that?

725

I got it.

729
00:38:07,995 --> 00:38:09,473
[Agent Sharpe] So someone
shut down the entire ship?

730
00:38:09,497 --> 00:38:11,373
Yeah, and we have to do
a complete reboot

731
00:38:11,457 --> 00:38:12,809
in order to get Gideon back online

732
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:14,478
so we can figure out
what the hell happened.

733
00:38:14,502 --> 00:38:16,128
Where are Mick and Gary?

734
00:38:16,212 --> 00:38:17,379
John, have you seen them?

735
00:38:17,463 --> 00:38:18,672
No. No, I haven't.

736
00:38:19,215 --> 00:38:21,443
No, that spell's left me
with the mother of all hangovers.

I'll see you guys later.

Hey, you want some company?

739
00:38:26,305 --> 00:38:29,099
Oh, I'm just gonna chill
back at the house. I'll be all right.

740
00:38:29,683 --> 00:38:34,313
Hmm. Well, then I will come over later
and bring you your favorite tea.

What's a busted up old codger like me
done to deserve a woman like you?

742
00:38:38,567 --> 00:38:39,902
I don't know. Must be magic.

743
00:38:42,947 --> 00:38:44,490
- I'll see you later.
- Bye.

- Yeah.
- Good.

Look, Z, I'm sorry.

747
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:56,937
For everything I said before,
for pinning everything on John.

748

I went into overprotective brother mode.

Hey, I protect you.

750

Not the other way around, okay?

You don't worry about me.

752
00:39:03,968 --> 00:39:06,303
Besides, have you ever met
someone I can't handle?

753
00:39:06,387 --> 00:39:07,763
- Mom?
- Mmm.

754
00:39:07,847 --> 00:39:09,849
I'd argue she can't handle me, but...

- Oh.

what happened to this family heirloom.

You're gonna tell them the truth?

On second thought,

760
00:39:20,484 --> 00:39:22,587
maybe I'll just take it easy
and enjoy <i>Maman's</i> cooking.
