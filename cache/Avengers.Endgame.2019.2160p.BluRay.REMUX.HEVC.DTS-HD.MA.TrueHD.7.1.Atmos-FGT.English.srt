where Thanos is.

209

Thanos spent a long time
trying to perfect me.

210
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:04,784
And when he worked, he talked
about his Great Plan.

211

Even disassembled,
I wanted to please him.

where would we go
once his plan was complete?

214
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,336
And his answer
was always the same.

215
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:20,550
"To the Garden."

216

That's cute.
Thanos has a retirement plan.

217

So, where is he?

218
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,057
When Thanos snapped
his fingers...

219
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,226
Earth became ground zero
for a power surge

00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:22,357
but then exit
the quantum realm

493
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:23,608
at another point in time?

494
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,110
Like...

495
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:27,946
- Like before Thanos.
- STEVE: Wait.

496
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:29,698
Are you talking
about a time machine?

497
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:32,617
No. No, of course not.
No, not a time machine.

498
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:33,827
This is more like a...

499
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:37,789
Yeah. Like a time machine.

500
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,749
I know, it's crazy.
It's crazy.

501
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:41,960
(STAMMERS) But I can't stop
thinking about it.

502
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,295
There's gotta be...

503
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,422
some way... (SIGHS)

504
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,299
- It's crazy.
- NATASHA: Scott.

505
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:48,758
I get emails from a raccoon...

506
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:50,927
so nothing
sounds crazy anymore.

507
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,763
So, who do we talk to
about this?

508
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:13,116
Chow time!

509
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:16,620
Maguna.

510
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:22,292
Morgan H. Stark,
you want some lunch?

511
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:24,336
<i>Define "lunch"</i>

512
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:25,670
<i>- or be disintegrated.</i>
- Okay.

513
00:33:27,047 --> 00:33:28,548
You should not be
wearing that, okay?

514
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,050
That is part of
a special anniversary gift

515
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,218
I'm making for Mom.

516
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:37,557
There you go.
You thinking about lunch?

517
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,643
I can give you a handful of
crickets on a bed of lettuce.

518
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:41,520
- No.
- That's what you want.

519
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,813
How did you find this?

520
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,815
- Garage.
- Really?

521
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,984
- Were you looking for it?
- No.

522
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,737
- I found it, though.
- Hmm.

523
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:52,656
You like
going in the garage, huh?

524
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:54,741
So does Daddy. (GRUNTS)

525
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:57,661
It's fine, actually. Mom never
wears anything I buy her.

526
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:01,623
So, I'm gonna...

527
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,685
(STAMMERS) No.
We know what it sounds like.

528
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:22,811
Tony, after everything
you've seen,

529
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:23,895
is anything really impossible?

530
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:26,189
Quantum fluctuation messes
with the Planck scale...

531
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:28,024
which then triggers
the Deutsch Proposition.

532
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:29,150
Can we agree on that?

533
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:30,402
Thank you.

534
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:32,696
In layman's terms, it means
you're not coming home.

535
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:34,281
- I did.
- No.

536
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,324
You accidentally survived.
(SIGHS)

537
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:38,577
It's a billion-to-one
cosmic fluke.

538
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,830
And now you wanna pull a...
What do you call it?

539
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:45,208
A time heist?

540
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:47,502
Yeah, a time heist. Of course.

541
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:48,795
Why didn't we think
of this before?

542
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:51,423
Oh, because it's laughable.
Because it's a pipe dream.

543
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,675
The stones are in the past.

544
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,093
We could go back,
we could get them.

545
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,554
We can snap our own fingers.
We can bring everybody back.

546
00:34:57,721 --> 00:34:59,639
Or screw it up worse than
he already has, right?

547
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:00,807
I don't believe we would.

548
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:03,935
Gotta say it. I sometimes miss
that giddy optimism.

549
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,521
However, high hopes
won't help...

550
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:08,648
if there's no logical,
tangible way

551
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:12,193
for me to safely execute
said time heist.

552
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,237
I believe
the most likely outcome

553
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:15,322
will be our collective demise.

554
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:18,241
Not if we strictly follow
the rules of time travel.

555
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:21,077
All right? It means no talking
to our past selves...

556
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:22,704
no betting on sporting events.

557
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:24,623
I'm gonna stop you
right there, Scott.

558
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,916
Are you seriously telling me

559
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,793
that your plan
to save the universe...

560
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,629
is based on
<i>Back to the Future?</i>

561
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:33,506
- Is it?
- No.

562
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:34,716
Good. You had me
worried there.

563
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:35,842
'Cause that would be
horseshit.

564
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:38,303
That's not how
quantum physics works.

565
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,638
Tony.

566
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:43,058
We have to take a stand.

567
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:45,602
We did stand.
And yet, here we are.

568
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:49,230
SCOTT: I know you got
a lot on the line.

569
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:52,275
You got a wife, a daughter.

570
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:54,944
But I lost someone
very important to me.

571
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,696
A lotta people did.

572
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:59,866
And now, now we have a chance
to bring her back...

573
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:01,201
to bring everyone back,

574
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:02,786
and you're telling me
that you won't even...

575
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,663
That's right, Scott.
I won't even.

576
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:07,707
- I can't.
- (DOOR CLOSES)

577
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:09,125
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

578
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:12,212
MORGAN STARK: Mommy told me
to come and save you.

579
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:14,714
Good job. I'm saved.

580
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:17,509
I wish you were coming here
to ask me something else.

581
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:18,718
Anything else.

582
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:20,595
I'm honestly happy
to see you guys, I just...

583
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,055
Oh, look,
the table's set for six.

584
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,640
Tony. I get it.

585
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:26,101
And I'm happy for you.
I really am.

586
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:28,395
But this is a second chance.

587
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:31,523
I got my second chance
right here, Cap.

588
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,233
Can't roll the dice on it.

589
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:37,237
If you don't talk shop,
you can stay for lunch.

590
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:41,700
Well, he's scared.

591
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:43,493
STEVE: He's not wrong.

592
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,662
SCOTT: Yeah, but, I mean,
what are we gonna do?

593
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,038
We need him.
What, are we gonna stop?

594
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:49,958
No, I wanna do it right.

595
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:54,838
We're gonna need
a really big brain.

596
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:57,090
Bigger than his?

597
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:59,384
Come on, I feel like
I'm the only one eating here.

598
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:00,510
Try some of that.

599
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:01,594
Have some eggs.

600
00:37:02,095 --> 00:37:03,430
I'm so confused.

601
00:37:03,513 --> 00:37:05,265
These are confusing times.
(CHUCKLES)

602
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,267
Right, no, no.
That's not what I meant.

603
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:09,936
Nah, I get it. I'm kidding!

604
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,313
I know, it's crazy.

605
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,690
I'm wearing shirts now.

606
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:16,693
Yeah. What? How? Why?

607
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:19,487
Five years ago,
we got our asses beat.

608
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:21,740
Except it was worse for me...

609
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,116
'cause I lost twice.

610
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:25,076
First, Hulk lost,
then Banner lost...

611
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:27,287
and then, we all lost.

612
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,621
No one blamed you, Bruce.

613
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,165
I did.

614
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,168
For years,
I've been treating the Hulk

615
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,377
like he's
some kind of disease...

616
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:35,920
something to get rid of.

617
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:39,340
But then, I start looking
at him as the cure.

618
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,051
Eighteen months
in the gamma lab.

619
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:44,804
I put the brains
and the brawn together...

620
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,222
and now, look at me.

621
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,600
Best of both worlds.

622
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,685
- Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?
- Yes.

623
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:52,187
Can we get a photo?

624
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,606
100%, little person.

625
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:56,816
Come on, step on up.
Do you mind?

626
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,277
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- SMART HULK: Thanks.

627
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,945
Say "green."

628
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,364
- FANS: Green.
- Green.

629
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:04,449
Did you get that?

630
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:05,867
That's a good one.

631
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,912
Did you want to grab one
with me? I'm Ant-Man.

632
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:14,501
They're Hulk fans.
They don't know Ant-Man.

633
00:38:14,584 --> 00:38:15,752
- Nobody does.
- No, he wants you to take

634
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,545
- a picture with him.
- I don't want a picture.

635
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:18,713
BOY 1: Stranger danger.

636
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,340
Yeah, look, he's even
saying no, he doesn't.

637
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:21,424
I get it.
I don't want it, either.

638
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:22,634
But come on. The kid...

639
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,135
I don't want a picture
with them.

640
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,303
- He's gonna feel bad.
- Sorry.

641
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:26,721
They're happy to do it.
They said they'll do it.

642
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:28,348
SCOTT: I don't want to do it.
BOY 2: We can do it.

643
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:30,475
- SMART HULK: No, you feel bad.
- Take the goddamn phone.

644
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:31,768
SMART HULK: Okay.

645
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:32,852
GIRL: Thank you, Mr. Hulk.

646
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:34,604
SMART HULK: No, it was great,
kids. Thank you very much.

647
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:36,439
ALL: Hulk out!

648
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:37,649
STEVE: Bruce.

649
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:39,067

Hey, hey, hey!

980
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:07,317
I'm being very careful.

981
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:08,902
No, you're being very Hulky.

982
00:58:08,986 --> 00:58:09,987
I'm being careful.

983
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:11,530
These are Pym Particles,
all right?

984
00:58:11,697 --> 00:58:12,948
And ever since
Hank Pym got snapped

985
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:14,282
out of existence, this is it.

986
00:58:14,366 --> 00:58:16,118
This is what we have.
We're not making any more.

- SCOTT: Sorry.

988

998
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:41,810
a little discombobulated
from the chronoshift.

999
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:42,894
Don't worry about that.

RHODES: Wait a second.
Let me ask you something.

1001
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:45,897
If we can do this, you know...

1002
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:48,400
go back in time, why don't
we just find baby Thanos?

1003
00:58:48,567 --> 00:58:49,735
You know, and...

1004
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:54,823
First of all, that's horrible.

1005
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:55,907
It's Thanos.

1006
00:58:55,991 --> 00:58:58,076
And secondly,
time doesn't work that way.

1007
00:58:58,243 --> 00:59:00,412
Changing the past
doesn't change the future.

1008
00:59:00,579 --> 00:59:01,955
Look, we go back,
we get the stones

1009
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:03,290
before Thanos gets them...

1010
00:59:03,457 --> 00:59:06,209
Thanos doesn't have
the stones. Problem solved.

1011
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:08,211
- Bingo.
- That's not how it works.

1012
00:59:08,295 --> 00:59:09,296
Well, that's what I heard.

1013
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:10,505
Wait, but who?
Who told you that?

1014
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:12,466
<i>Star Trek,
Terminator, Timecop...</i>

1015

1021
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:23,226
<i>Die Hard.</i>
No, that's not one.

1022
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:24,436
This is known.

1023
00:59:24,603 --> 00:59:25,812
I don't know
why everyone believes that,

1024
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:26,938
but that isn't true.

1025
00:59:27,022 --> 00:59:29,024
Think about it.
If you travel to the past...

1026
00:59:29,191 --> 00:59:31,526
that past becomes
your future...

1027
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:34,654
and your former present
becomes the past...

1028
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:37,449
which can't now be changed
by your new future.

1029
00:59:37,616 --> 00:59:38,825
Exactly.

1030
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:42,287
So <i>Back to the Future</i>
is a bunch of bullshit?

Yeah. Yeah. (PANTING)

1054
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:49,623
It worked.

STEVE: Okay, so the how works.

1056
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:58,298
Now, we gotta figure out
the when and the where.

1057
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:00,926
Almost everyone in this room
has had an encounter...

1058
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:02,761
with at least one of
the six Infinity Stones.

1059
01:02:02,928 --> 01:02:04,429
Or substitute
the word "encounter"...

1060
01:02:04,596 --> 01:02:05,680
for "damn near been killed"

1061
01:02:05,764 --> 01:02:07,182
by one of
the six Infinity Stones.

1062
01:02:07,349 --> 01:02:08,516
Well, I haven't...

1063
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:09,601
but I don't even know

1064
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:11,019
what the hell
you're all talking about.

1065
01:02:11,186 --> 01:02:14,064
Regardless, we only have
enough Pym Particles

1066
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:15,941
for one round-trip each.

1067
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:17,317
And these stones have been

1068
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,319
in a lot of different places
throughout history.

1069
01:02:19,486 --> 01:02:20,779
Our history.

1070
01:02:20,946 --> 01:02:23,949
So, not a lot of convenient
spots to just drop in, yeah?

1071
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:25,909
Which means we have to
pick our targets.

1072
01:02:26,368 --> 01:02:27,619
Correct.

1073
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:30,580
So, let's start
with the Aether.

1074
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:31,957
Thor, what do you know?

1075
01:02:37,545 --> 01:02:38,755
NATASHA: Is he asleep?

1076
01:02:38,922 --> 01:02:41,466
RHODES: No, no.
I'm pretty sure he's dead.

1077
01:02:44,552 --> 01:02:46,221
Uh, where to start? Um...

1078
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:50,433
The Aether, firstly,
is not a stone.

1079
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:52,727
Someone called it
a stone before.

1080
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:58,108
Um, it's more of an angry
sludge sort of a thing...

1081
01:02:58,275 --> 01:02:59,901
so someone's gonna need
to amend that

1082
01:02:59,985 --> 01:03:01,152
and stop saying that.

1083
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:04,155
Here's an interesting story,
though, about the Aether.

1084
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:06,199
My grandfather,
many years ago...

1085
01:03:06,366 --> 01:03:09,869
had to hide the stone
from the Dark Elves.

1086
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:12,747
Ooh. (CHUCKLES) Scary beings.

1087
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:14,624
So, Jane, actually...

1088
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:16,751
Oh, there she is.

1089
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:20,588
Yeah, so Jane was
an old flame of mine.

1090
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:24,801
You know, she stuck her hand
inside a rock this one time...

1091
01:03:24,968 --> 01:03:27,804
and then the Aether
stuck itself inside her...

1092
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:30,015
and she became
very, very sick.

1093
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:32,058
And so I had to
take her to Asgard,

1094
01:03:32,142 --> 01:03:33,310
which is where I'm from...

1095
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:35,437
and we had to try and fix her.

1096
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:37,230
We were dating at the time,
you see...

1097
01:03:37,397 --> 01:03:40,775
and I got to introduce her
to my mother...

1098
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:44,154
(SIGHS) who's dead and, um...

1099
01:03:45,572 --> 01:03:47,073
Oh, you know, Jane and I

1100
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:49,075
aren't even
dating anymore, so...

1101
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:50,160
(MOUTHING)

1102
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:51,411
Yes, these things happen,
though. You know?

1103
01:03:51,536 --> 01:03:52,871
Nothing lasts forever.
The only thing that...

1104
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:54,789
- Why don't you come sit down?
- I'm not done yet.

1105
01:03:54,956 --> 01:03:56,499
The only thing
that is permanent in life

1106
01:03:56,583 --> 01:03:58,001
is impermanence. (LAUGHS)

1107
01:03:58,752 --> 01:04:01,046
Awesome.
Eggs? Breakfast?

1108
01:04:01,212 --> 01:04:03,256
No. I'd like a Bloody Mary.

1109
01:04:03,423 --> 01:04:05,550
ROCKET: Quill said he stole
the Power Stone from Morag.

1110
01:04:06,634 --> 01:04:09,346
- SMART HULK: Is that a person?
- No, Morag's a planet.

1111
01:04:10,055 --> 01:04:11,431
Quill was a person.

1112
01:04:12,182 --> 01:04:14,517
Like a planet?
Like in outer space?

1113
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:16,102
Oh, look.

1114
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:18,897
It's like a little puppy,
all happy and everything.

1115
01:04:19,064 --> 01:04:22,233
Do you wanna go to space?
You wanna go to space, puppy?

1116
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,526
I'll take you to space.

1117

the Soul Stone on Vormir.

What is Vormir?

1119
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:30,283

at the very center
of celestial existence.

1121
01:04:34,788 --> 01:04:38,792
It's where
Thanos murdered my sister.

1122
01:04:42,921 --> 01:04:44,047

in the Village, though.

1128
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:56,935
TONY: Yeah,
on Sullivan Street?

1129
01:04:57,102 --> 01:04:58,144
SMART HULK:
Mm... Bleecker Street.

1130
01:04:58,269 --> 01:04:59,354
Wait, he lived in New York?

1131
01:04:59,938 --> 01:05:00,980
TONY: No, he lived in Toronto.

1132

Remove one of the stones...

01:24:24,977 --> 01:24:27,145
Can your science
prevent all that?

1512

No...

1513
01:24:29,314 --> 01:24:30,440
but we can erase it.

1514
01:24:30,607 --> 01:24:32,317
Because once we're done
with the stones...

1515
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:34,653
we can return each one
to its own timeline...

you have to survive.

I can't risk this reality

It's the duty

to protect the Time Stone.

You wanna know
what he does to you?

1926
01:47:26,899 --> 01:47:27,900
That's enough.

You disgust me.

But that doesn't mean
you're useless.

1931
01:48:10,025 --> 01:48:11,735
How do I look?

1932
01:48:18,325 --> 01:48:19,326
Wow.

Under different

1934
01:48:23,622 --> 01:48:25,624
this would be totally awesome.

I bet the raccoon

didn't have to climb
a mountain.

1937

Technically he's not
a raccoon, you know?

1938
01:48:42,766 --> 01:48:44,393
Oh, whatever.
He eats garbage.

In order to take the stone...

1958
01:49:55,506 --> 01:49:58,509
you must lose
that which you love.

1959

this shit up.

No.

1965
01:50:22,032 --> 01:50:23,033
I don't think so.

1966
01:50:23,742 --> 01:50:25,911
Why? 'Cause he knows
your daddy's name?

1967
01:50:27,412 --> 01:50:28,455
I didn't.

1968
01:50:29,957 --> 01:50:32,334
Thanos left here
with the stone...

without his daughter.

That's not a coincidence.

01:50:37,881 --> 01:50:39,508
Yeah.

1972
01:50:41,218 --> 01:50:43,095
Whatever it takes.

1973
01:50:47,599 --> 01:50:49,101
Whatever it takes.

If we don't get that stone...

1975
01:50:55,607 --> 01:50:57,276
billions of people stay dead.

1976
01:50:58,152 --> 01:50:59,319
Yeah.

1977
01:51:01,196 --> 01:51:03,323
Then I guess we both know
who it's gotta be.

1978
01:51:04,074 --> 01:51:05,242
I guess we do.

1979
01:51:13,667 --> 01:51:15,794
I'm starting to think we mean

different people here,
Natasha.

1981

For the last five years, I've
been trying to do one thing.

1982
01:51:20,883 --> 01:51:22,134
Get to right here.

1983
01:51:22,301 --> 01:51:24,303
That's all it's been about.
Bringing everybody back.

1984
01:51:24,469 --> 01:51:26,680
No, don't you get
all decent on me now.

1985
01:51:26,847 --> 01:51:28,849
What, you think I wanna do it?

1986
01:51:29,433 --> 01:51:31,185
I'm trying to save your life,
you idiot.

1987
01:51:31,351 --> 01:51:33,687
Yeah, well, I don't
want you to. How's that?

01:51:34,605 --> 01:51:36,815
Natasha, you know
what I've done.

You know what I've become.

Oh, I don't judge people
on their worst mistakes.

1991
01:51:49,161 --> 01:51:50,412
Maybe you should.

1992
01:51:51,288 --> 01:51:52,831
You didn't.

1993
01:51:59,004 --> 01:52:01,215
You're a pain in my ass,
you know that?

1994
01:52:12,309 --> 01:52:13,518
Okay.

Let me go.

No.

No. Please, no.

this actually worked?

Yeah.

Huh?

- What are you doing?
- Just asked him a question.

2024
01:56:09,171 --> 01:56:10,422
Yeah, no, you're acting
like she's dead.

Why are we acting
like she's dead?

We have the stones, right?

2027
01:56:13,216 --> 01:56:14,217
As long as we have
the stones...

2028
01:56:14,384 --> 01:56:16,136
Cap, we can bring her back.
Isn't that right?

2029
01:56:16,303 --> 01:56:18,305
So, stop this shit. We're the

Look, I'm sorry, no offense,

01:56:31,568 --> 01:56:33,236
but you're a very
earthly being, okay?

And we're talking
about space magic.

definitive. Don't you think?

It can't be undone.

Or that's at least

2045

what the red,
floating guy had to say.

Maybe you wanna go
talk to him, okay?

Go grab your hammer and you
go fly and you talk to him.

It was supposed to be me.

She sacrificed her life
for that goddamn stone.

2050

We have to make it worth it.

We have to.

We will.

All right, the glove's ready.

01:58:00,282 --> 01:58:02,867
Question is, who's gonna
snap their freakin' fingers?

2060
01:58:03,034 --> 01:58:05,120
- I'll do it.
- TONY: Excuse me?

Thor. Just wait.

2064
01:58:09,124 --> 01:58:10,959
We haven't decided
who's gonna put that on yet.

2065
01:58:11,334 --> 01:58:12,919
I'm sorry. What,
we're all just sitting around

2066
01:58:13,003 --> 01:58:14,254
waiting for
the right opportunity?

2067
01:58:14,421 --> 01:58:15,547
We should at least discuss it.

2068
01:58:15,714 --> 01:58:17,674
Look, sitting here
staring at the thing

2069
01:58:17,757 --> 01:58:19,551
is not gonna bring
everybody back.

I'm the strongest Avenger,
okay?

So, this responsibility
falls upon me.

- Normally, you're right.
- It's my duty.

- It's not about that.
- It's not that. (SHUSHES)

Just let me do it.

2076

Just let me do something good.
Something right.

2077
01:58:36,151 --> 01:58:37,152
Look, it's not
just the fact...

2078
01:58:37,319 --> 01:58:38,445
that that glove is channeling
enough energy

2079
01:58:38,528 --> 01:58:39,446
to light up a continent.

You're in no condition.

02:43:41,812 --> 02:43:43,355
This one's on me, though.

2579
02:43:47,818 --> 02:43:49,737
Don't do anything stupid
till I get back.

2580
02:43:51,572 --> 02:43:52,823
How can I?

2581
02:43:52,990 --> 02:43:54,783
You're taking
all the stupid with you.

2582
02:44:02,374 --> 02:44:04,168
Gonna miss you, buddy.

2583
02:44:04,543 --> 02:44:06,045
It's gonna be okay, Buck.

How long is this gonna take?

2586
02:44:15,471 --> 02:44:18,223
For him, as long as he needs.
For us, five seconds.

2587
02:44:23,312 --> 02:44:24,563
You ready, Cap?

2588
02:44:24,730 --> 02:44:27,149
All right, we'll meet you
back here, okay?

Where is he?

2598
02:44:52,299 --> 02:44:54,051
I don't know. He blew
right by his time stamp.

2599
02:44:54,218 --> 02:44:55,677
He should be here.

Hi, Sam.

2606
02:45:56,822 --> 02:45:59,867
So, did something go wrong
or did something go right?

2607
02:46:01,994 --> 02:46:05,831
Well, after I put
the stones back, I thought...

2608
02:46:06,957 --> 02:46:08,292
maybe...

2609
02:46:08,792 --> 02:46:13,589
I'll try some of that life
Tony was telling me to get.

How'd that work out for ya?

Only thing bumming me out...

2616
02:46:30,689 --> 02:46:32,274
is the fact
I have to live in a world
