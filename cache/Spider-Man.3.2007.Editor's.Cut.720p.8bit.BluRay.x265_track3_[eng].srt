1
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:18,990
It's me, Peter Parker.
Your friendly neighborhood...

2
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,200
...you know.

3
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:23,370
I've come a long way from being
the boy who was bit by a spider.

4
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:26,415
Back then, nothing seemed
to go right for me. Now--

5
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:27,958
Wow, look, it's Spider-Man!

6
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,793
- Super cool!
- Spider-man!

7
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,962
People really like me.

8
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:34,881
Hey, stick around. It's gonna start again
in a couple minutes.

9
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,634
- Nah.
- That's okay.

10
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:40,554
The city is safe and sound.

11
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,681
I guess I've had something
to do with that.

12
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,641
My Uncle Ben would be proud.

13
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,607
I still get to school.
Top of my class.

14
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,651
Now, the Hamiltonian shows us...

15
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:59,072
...that the energy levels are
perturbed by the electric field.

16
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:05,996
From the form of this matrix,
we can see...?

17
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,165
Miss Stacy?

18
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:11,626
That only the "m equals zero
quantum states" are affected.

19
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:14,880
Correct. Good work, Miss Stacy.

20
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:22,262
Parker? You got something to add?

21
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,765
No, sir.

22
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:31,313
And I'm in love
with the girl of my dreams.

23
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:48,205
Hi.

24
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:52,793
Miss Watson left a ticket for me.
Peter Parker.

25
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:55,337
Excuse me. Sorry.

26
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:57,923
Thank you. Sorry.

27
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:06,306
Oh. I'm so nervous.

- I thought she was good.
- Yeah.

44
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:51,745
Harry?

45
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:53,330
Harry!

46
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:55,206
I need to talk to you.

47
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,918
Explain things.

48
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:03,548
Tell it to my father.
Raise him from the dead.

49
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:09,095
I'm your friend, Harry.
I cared about your father.

50
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:19,230
M.J.!

51
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,691
- Peter!
- Congrats!

52
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:24,152
- Was I good?
- Good? You were great.

53
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,655
- You were--
- You said great.

54
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:30,367
I love my flowers, they're beautiful.
And those are from Harry.

55
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:34,454
- Was he here tonight?
- Yeah, I ran into him outside.

56
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:37,749
- What's with you guys anyway?
- It's complicated.

57
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,960
Tell me again.
Was I really good?

58
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,504
I was so nervous.
My knees were shaking.

59
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:45,173
- Your knees were ﬁne.
- The applause wasn't very loud.

60
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,258
Yes, it was.
Well, it's the acoustics.

61
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:50,595
It's all about diffusion. It keeps
the sound waves from grouping.

62
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:53,598
You see, when the sound waves,
they propagate, then it's like an--

63
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,767
You are such a nerd.

64
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,399
- Wow.
- Ooh.

65
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,530
Did you see that one?

66
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:02,584
- You know what?
- Mm.

67
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:06,504
I'd like to sing on-stage
for the rest of my life...

68
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,090
...with you in the first row.

69
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,260
I'll be there.

70
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,473
Tell me you love me.

71
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,602
I love you.

72
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,313
I love you so much.

73
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,149
I always have.

74
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,323
- Ready?
- Yep.

75
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,274
You can't hide here, Flint.

76
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:17,820
- I'm just here to see my daughter.
- You are an escaped convict.

77
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:21,783
The cops are looking for you.
You're not getting near her.

78
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,453
You're nothing but a common thief.

79
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,123
- You maybe even killed a man?
- It wasn't like that.

80
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,668
It wasn't.

81
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,003
I had good reason for what I was doing.

82
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,380
And that's the truth.

83
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:39,759
You and the truth, sitting in prison,
having three meals a day together.

84
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,512
I live in the presence of great truth...

85
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:45,014
...and that is the truth
that you left behind...

86
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,724
...right there in that bedroom.

87
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,865
Penny.

88
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,535
I missed you.

89
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:09,247
I miss you too, Daddy.

90
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:23,761
I promise I'll make you healthy again.

91
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,889
Whatever it takes, I'll get the money.

92
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:30,143
You get out of here. Now.

93
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,822
I'm not a bad person.

94
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:47,368
Just had bad luck.

95
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,888
Peter, what is it?

96
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,475
It's M.J.

97
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:16,647
- I'm gonna ask her to marry me.
- Oh, Peter. Oh!

98
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:21,569
The day your Uncle Ben asked me
to marry him, we were so scared.

99
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:23,571
And excited.

100
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:25,531
And very young.

101
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,618
And I loved him so fiercely.

102
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:30,828
- And you said yes, right?
- No.

103
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,414
I wanted to say yes,
but I said no.

104
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:36,292
I wasn't ready. Neither was he.

105
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,795
So we took our time.

106
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,339
Looked forward to it.

107
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:45,134
Didn't want to run into something
with nothing to count on but love.

108
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,347
A man has to be understanding...

109
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:52,600
...and put his wife before himself.

110
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:55,895
Can you do that, Peter?

111
00:14:57,522 --> 00:15:00,316
Yeah, I think I can.

112
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:03,820
Then you have my blessing.

113
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:08,991
Oh. I hope you've considered
a proper proposal.

114
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:12,495
Your uncle had it all planned.

115
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:14,622
He took me to the beach
one Sunday.

116
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:17,583
Oh, he was a knockout
in his bathing suit. Heh.

117
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,253
And I didn't look too bad myself.

118
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,422
We were very good swimmers.

119
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,133
And it was a beautiful day
and he said:

120
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,218
"Let's swim to the island."

121
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:32,807
And at the island, we found
a perfect spot by an old tree...

122
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:36,519
...and we lay down
and looked up at the sky.

123
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:39,939
And then he said,
"Close your eyes, May."

124
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,859
And I did. And then
he said, "Open them."

125
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,861
And I did.

126
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,905
And he was holding this ring.

127
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,700
Dazzling...

128
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,618
...in front of me.

129
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,373
I thought it was the sun.

130
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,628
We'd be married 50 years...

131
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:06,382
...come August, if...

132
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:14,390
So...

133
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:21,397
I hope you'll make it
very special for Mary Jane.

134
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:25,276
Do something she'll never forget.

135
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,906
Give her this.

136
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:34,285
Go on. Take it.

137
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,948
- Harry.
- You knew this was coming, Pete.

138
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,162
Listen to me. I didn't kill your father.

139
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:04,000
He was trying to kill me.
He killed himself.

140
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,918
Shut up!

141
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:50,272
I'm still here, Peter.

142
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,382
Hate those things.

143
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,134
Oh!

144
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:16,525
Harry?

145
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:21,947
Harry.

146
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,533
Harry!

147
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,498
Oh, my God.

148
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,465
Harry!

149
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:43,219
Come on!

150
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:47,556
God.

151
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:52,436
- Deﬁb.
- TWO hundred.

152
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:54,396
And clear.

153
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:55,773
No response.

154
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,733
- Recharge, let's go again.
- Go ahead.

155
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,277
- Charging.
- And clear.

156
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,487
No response.

157
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:04,865
Let's recharge and do it
one more time. And clear.

158
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:12,081
Captain Stacy.

159
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,124
- What's this?
- Flint Marko.

160
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,418
The guy we tied to
the Ben Parker homicide.

161
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,420
- What about him?
- He just broke out of Rikers.

162
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:19,922
- And?
- He's on the run.

163
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:22,258
He's in the marshlands.
I think we got him.

164
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,180
There he is!

165
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:49,785
You two, take
the west side. Tommy, take the east.

166
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:55,833
Where did he go?

167
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,648
- Capacitors charged.
- Right.

168
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,817
Donnie, we got a little fluctuation on one.

169
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:23,569
There's a change in the silicon mass.

170
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,905
Yeah, it's probably a bird.
It'll fly away when we fire it up.

171
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,656
Initiating demolecularization.

172
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,665
- How is he?
- He's gonna be okay.

173
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:02,251
But there's been some
memory impairment.

174
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:04,086
Particularly his short-term memory.

175
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:06,296
Right now he can't
remember the accident...

176
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,590
...or anything that happened
to him recently.

177
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,009
Is it permanent?

178
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:13,220
It could be. Only time will tell.

179
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:14,972
He's awake if you wanna see him.

180
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:17,266
Oh. Maybe I should wait.

181
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:20,769
No, it's fine. Just keep it brief.
I want him to rest.

182
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,206
Hey, buddy.

183
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:43,292
Hey.

184
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:45,586
Hit my head.

185
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:47,254
Yeah.

186
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:49,798
Doctor said I was in an accident.

187
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,050
Hit-and-run.

188
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:54,303
I don't remember much of anything.

189
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,473
My father...

190
00:25:58,098 --> 00:25:59,558
...he died, right?

191
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:04,313
This is all so weird.

192
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:09,026
Hi. I got here as fast as I could.

193
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:10,235
I know that face.

194
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:11,945
How you doing?

195
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,614
I don't know.

196
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:15,824
Last thing I remember, I was fine.

197
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,159
Somewhere.

198
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,119
You're still fine.

199
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,498
We love you, Harry.

200
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:25,167
It feels like...

201
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:29,463
...somehow I've been gone
for a really long time.

202
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,758
And now I'm back home.

203
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,594
It's good to have you back.

204
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:39,681
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to ask you guys
to scoot, okay?

205
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:42,184
- Okay.
- All right. Thank you.

206
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:44,311
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

207
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:46,522
Yeah. Great.

208
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:48,857
Get some sleep.

209
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,822
- I think he's gonna be ﬁne.
- I think so.

210
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:57,616
- And you guys seem great.
- Yeah.

211
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:02,371
You have lovely friends.

212
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:04,665
My best friends.

213
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:09,503
I'd give my life for them.

214
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:20,986
- Yeah?
- It's me.

215
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:23,113
Oh! Hey.

216
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,241
Peter, you know I can't open the door.

217
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:27,826
It's stuck again?

218
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:30,412
Just come on and help me.

219
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:32,164
I'm coming.

220
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:39,755
- Hey.
- The review.

221
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:41,131
Oh!

222
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:44,426
- They hated it. They hated me.
- Well, they can't hate you.

223
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:46,845
"The young Miss Watson
is a pretty girl...

224
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:49,139
...easy on the eyes,
but not on the ears.

225
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:51,600
Her small voice didn't carry
past the first row."

226
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:53,852
That's ridiculous, I was right there.

227
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:55,604
You were in the first row.

228
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:59,107
Yeah, this--
Listen, you were great.

229
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:03,695
That's a critic. This is something
you're gonna have to get used to.

230
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:07,366
Believe me, I know.
Spider-Man gets attacked all the time.

231
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:11,536
This isn't about you. This is about me.
It's about my career.

232
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:15,165
I know, and I'm just saying
you can't let it bring you down.

233
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:18,126
You just gotta believe in yourself
and you pull yourself together.

234
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:19,961
You get right back
on the horse and--

235
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:21,963
Don't give me the horse thing.

236
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,549
Try and understand how I feel.

237
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:31,181
It's just...

238
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,311
I look at these words...

239
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,606
...and it's like my father wrote them.

240
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:41,817
All cars.

241
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:44,861
All cars in the vicinity of 54th
and Sixth Avenue, please report.

242
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:47,697
Crane out of control,
approach with caution.

243
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:52,661
"Go get them, tiger"?

244
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:56,540
I'm sorry.

245
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:32,033
Oh, my God. 7-Adam to Central.

246
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,036
That crane job you sent us on?
It's bigger than we thought.

247
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,706
We're gonna need
a major mobilization right away.

248
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:48,341
Shut it down at the generator. Now!

249
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:55,056
Okay, Gwen, I've got a secret:
It's my copier.

250
00:32:58,268 --> 00:33:01,062
What is that thing
doing in my background?

251
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:29,508
Captain Stacy, they got some kind of short
up there. They can't shut down the crane.

252
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:32,511
Get Edison on the phone. Have them
kill the power to the whole block.

253
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:37,265
Are you all right?

254
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:39,059
It's coming back.

255
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,187
Oh, no.

256
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:08,922
- Oh, my God. That's Gwen.
- What?

257
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:15,470
What's she doing up there?

258
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:18,431
I don't know, I just saw her last night.
She said she had a modeling gig.

259
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:21,560
- Who are you?
- It's Brock, sir. Edward Brock Jr.

260
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,478
And I work at the Daily Bugle.

261
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:26,606
And I'm dating your daughter.

262
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:23,330
You Okay?

263
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:25,874
Yeah, I'm fine.

264
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:27,083
Thank you.

265
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,628
Hey, Spidey, hold on.
Bugle needs a photo.

266
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,630
- Thank God you're okay.
- Daddy.

267
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,715
Hey. I'm the new guy.

268
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:35,342
- New guy?
- Sweetie.

269
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:37,677
You Okay?

270
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:40,722
From now on, I am gonna be
taking shots of you for the Bugle.

271
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:43,725
So smile. Are you smiling?
Just kidding.

272
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:45,935
- They got a guy.
- Who, Parker?

273
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:51,024
Um, yeah, look, just between you
and me, guy's kind of an amateur.

274
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:53,902
Have you noticed his stuff
makes you look a little bloated?

275
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:56,363
Just-- Yeah, a little chunky.

276
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:58,365
Okay.

277
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:02,160
But you don't have to worry
about that anymore, buddy.

278
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:11,419
Dazzle me.

279
00:36:15,632 --> 00:36:18,009
Pow. Zap.

280
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:21,930
Just a little something the boys
in the Ad Department and I whipped up.

281
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:25,016
As you know, circulation at
the Bugle's been pretty good.

282
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,102
Though not as good
as The New York Times.

283
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,729
Or the Daily News, or the Post,
or several other smaller--

284
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:30,980
Get on with it, you moron--!

285
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:34,317
- What?
- Your blood pressure.

286
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:36,236
Your wife told me
to tell you to watch the anger.

287
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:37,696
You tell my wife--

288
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:43,118
Thank you.

289
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:47,956
So I propose this campaign.

290
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:50,583
"Daily Bugle." That's obvious.

291
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,878
"It's hip, it's now."
I came up with that one.

292
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:57,465
"It's wow." That's actually Erickson.
He goes crazy.

293
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:00,051
We gave him a couple lattes,
he's like, phew!

294
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,845
"And how." That's me again.

295
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,432
Time to take your pill.

296
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:08,101
Not that one.

297
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:10,770
Not that one.

298
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:21,322
Drink plenty of water.

299
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,661
Thank you.

300
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:29,998
Continue.

301
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:33,334
♪ Betty, Betty, bo-Betty, banana-nana
Fo-fetty ♪♪

- He's busy.
- Oh, no.

303
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:37,922
- I'm just here to talk to you, beautiful.
- What's that smell?

304
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:41,384
That's a little something called
Nice and Easy. What's on you?

305
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:43,178
It's called Go Away.

306
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:45,305
Get out! That is the dumbest idea
you've ever had...

307
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:48,349
- ...and you have had some doozies.
- Blood pressure.

308
00:37:48,725 --> 00:37:50,518
Hey, where are you going?

309
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,731
- Who are you?
- You hired him last week. Freelance.

310
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:57,817
- I did? What's that smell?
- It's Brock, sir. Edward Brock Jr.

311
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:00,028
- Who? What--?
- Can I just say I really like that shirt?

312
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:01,321
Here, it's the crane accident.

313
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:03,364
- Check out the light source.
- He likes my shirt.

314
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:04,657
- Hey, Betty.
- Hey, Pete.

315
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:06,534
You better get in there. New guy.

316
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,703
He's trying to sell some Spidey photos.

317
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,371
Oh.

318
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,665
Thanks.

319
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:15,794
Parker. You're late, maybe too late.
Bruckner here beat you to it.

320
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,545
It's Brock, sir. Edward Brock Jr.

321
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:20,048
- But I got you this.
- But he got me this.

322
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:22,717
Wait, how'd you get that? I didn't see
you there. How'd you get that high?

323
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:25,595
- Climbed. Nearly fell off a flagpole.
- A flagpole?

324
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:28,640
- Which one do we use?
- I like Bernstein's.

325
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:30,058
- It's better.
- Cheaper too.

326
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:32,894
Congratulations, son, we'll use your shot.
I'll pay you 50 bucks.

327
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:34,521
All right, J.J., I'm your man.

328
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:37,398
I know more about what makes a good
picture than any photographer in this town.

329
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:41,277
See, photography, it's not just about,
no offense, uh, flagpoles or whatever.

330
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,696
It's about lighting.
Composition. Drama.

331
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:45,990
I want a staff job, sir.

332
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:49,327
I have a girl that
I intend to marry...

333
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:52,413
...and I guess, I don't know,
I have this stupid little dream...

334
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:56,042
...of working with one of the greatest
newspaper editors of our time.

335
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:58,002
J. Jonah Jameson.

336
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:04,217
Well, we do have an opening.
Johnson quit, remember?

337
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:05,552
- You fired him.
- Whatever.

338
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:08,638
Wait a minute. I know what makes a good
picture and I've been here a long time.

339
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:10,932
If there's a staff job, Mr. Jameson,
I think I deserve it.

340
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:14,853
He's right, Jonah. Peter's been with us
for years. He's done a great job.

341
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,980
You want a staff job,
and you want a staff job.

342
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:18,982
- Anybody care about what I want?
- I do.

343
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:20,942
Shut up. Get out.

344
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:24,571
I want the public to see Spider-Man
for the two-bit criminal he really is.

345
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:28,950
He's a fake, he's full of stickum.
Catch him in the act.

346
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:31,411
Spider-Man with his hand
in a cookie jar.

347
00:39:31,578 --> 00:39:33,538
Whoever brings me
that photo gets a job.

348
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:35,623
What are you waiting for,
Chinese New Year? Go, go, go.

349
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,208
I'm on it, boss.

350
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:39,961
You'll never get that shot.

351
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:41,462
Oh, we'll see.

352
00:39:55,977 --> 00:40:00,982
You know, I guess one person
can make a difference.

353
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:04,319
Enough said.

354
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,993
Welcome home, Harry.

355
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:16,164
- Thank God you're all right.
- Thanks, Bernard.

356
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:18,499
- Bernard.
- Sir.

357
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:23,004
Got you a little
homecoming present.

358
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,798
- It's your old ball.
- Yeah.

359
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:27,091
Thanks, buddy.

360
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:30,094
Hey, we were pretty good
in the back yard, weren't we?

361
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:33,932
We were terrible. And we tried out
for the varsity team.

362
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,142
- For the cheerleaders.
- Right.

363
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:38,853
- Hey, do I have any girlfriends?
- I don't know.

364
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,188
You don't?

365
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:43,358
Hey, Bernard.
Do I have any girlfriends?

366
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:46,027
Not that I know of, sir.

367
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:53,201
It's a pretty cool pad, huh?

368
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:55,036
It's okay.

369
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:58,164
- Looks like I'm not hurting for money.
- No.

370
00:40:58,331 --> 00:41:01,501
Well, maybe I can turn this
no-girlfriend thing around.

371
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:14,555
You know, he always appreciated
how you helped me through high school.

372
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,892
Just wish I could remember
more about him.

373
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:22,897
Well, he loved you.
That's the main thing.

374
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:28,403
Hey, let's watch a game in the kitchen.
Get something to eat.

375
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:29,737
Okay.

376
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:32,240
Whoa, heads up.

377
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:36,911
Did you see that?

378
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:39,914
- Still got the moves.
- Yeah.

379
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:54,053
♪ They say ♪

380
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:59,684
♪ And with a moon up above ♪

381
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:03,062
♪ It's wonderful ♪

382
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:07,150
♪ It's wonderful ♪

383
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:09,944
♪ So they tell me ♪♪

384
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:14,699
Why are we stopping?

385
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:19,871
What is she doing here?

386
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:21,956
Well, Gary
was supposed to call her agent.

387
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:27,211
Hi, honey.
We tried to reach you.

388
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:28,921
I'm sorry.

389
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:30,214
One critic?

390
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,591
No, all the papers, dear.

391
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,969
Mary Jane, honey, sit down.
Let us explain it to you.

392
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:37,764
Listen, if you'd like,
we could say you became ill.

393
00:42:48,775 --> 00:42:50,735
That was so poorly handled.

394
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:52,403
Yeah.

395
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:54,781
Let's just rehearse.

396
00:43:00,453 --> 00:43:02,789
All right, Spidey!

397
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,393
Go, Spidey!

398
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,646
All right!

399
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,278
Yeah, Spidey!

400
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:35,947
- Spidey!
- Yeah!

401
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:43,037
Spidey! Spidey! Spidey!

402
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:46,833
Excuse me, miss? Could I please see
that gorgeous smile?

403
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:48,751
Hi, Eddie. Ha, ha.

404
00:43:48,918 --> 00:43:52,046
You're so beautiful.
This is front-page stuff.

405
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:53,840
Okay, I've gotta practice.
I'll see you later, okay?

406
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:55,883
- How about tonight?
- Not tonight.

407
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,510
Why not?

408
00:43:57,677 --> 00:44:01,556
What about that amazing,
amazing night that we had?

409
00:44:02,974 --> 00:44:05,810
We had coffee, Eddie.

410
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:07,019
Hey, beautiful.

411
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:09,814
One more.

412
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:15,444
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

413
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:19,740
- You're not still mad at me, are you?
- No, Peter, I'm proud of you.

414
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,034
Hey, I'm gonna be
swinging in from over there.

415
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:24,287
- Oh, yeah?
- So you know where to look.

416
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:27,248
Give them a good show.

417
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:29,458
Don't worry about that review.

418
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:33,087
We're gonna be laughing about it
tomorrow night, I promise.

419
00:44:33,254 --> 00:44:34,839
Yeah.

420
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,150
Isn't that that guy from that prison break?

421
00:44:54,442 --> 00:44:55,860
He fits.

422
00:44:56,027 --> 00:44:58,571
Hey, you. Halt!

423
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:00,990
Cover the back.

424
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:07,330
- Hon, be careful.
- Come on, let's go.

425
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:56,254
He's in the truck.

426
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,422
Round the front.

427
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:12,979
Fire.

428
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:38,671
People of the city of New York...

429
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:42,341
...I am here today
because I fell 62 stories...

430
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:44,135
...and someone caught me.

431
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:47,305
Someone who never asks
for anything in return.

432
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:51,142
Someone who doesn't even
want us to know who he is.

433
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:52,393
Hey, M.J.

434
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,895
- Harry.
- Hey.

435
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:57,064
- Where's Pete?
- Um...

436
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:59,400
- Taking somebody's picture, I guess.
- Right.

437
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:02,361
I'm so happy to see you.
You look so good, Harry.

438
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:03,863
I've never felt better.

439
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:06,157
It's a weird feeling
not knowing who you are.

440
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:09,076
Bump on the head,
I'm as free as a bird.

441
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:11,579
- Will you bump me on the head?
- Bop.

442
00:47:13,748 --> 00:47:16,000
Hey, Pete said you're in a play.

443
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:18,878
You came. You sent me flowers.

444
00:47:19,045 --> 00:47:21,547
I did? I'll come again tonight.

445
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:25,259
You can't. I was let go.

446
00:47:25,426 --> 00:47:27,136
What happened?

447
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:30,264
I wasn't very good.

448
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:33,768
You know, this is embarrassing...

449
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:36,228
...but I once wrote you
a play in high school. Heh.

450
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:38,064
- You wrote me a play?
- Yeah.

451
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,815
Harry, that's the sweetest thing.

452
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:43,194
When you're
dropping without a parachute...

453
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:46,781
...or your store's being robbed
or your house is on fire...

454
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:49,033
...who is it that breaks your fall...

455
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,870
...puts out the flames
and saves your children?

456
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:54,705
Spider-Man!

457
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:55,956
They love me.

458
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:59,460
Then let's hear it
for your one and only...

459
00:47:59,627 --> 00:48:03,005
- ...friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.
- Spider-man!

460
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:19,355
Hey.
What's up? All right. How you doing?

461
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:22,942
Shazam!

462
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:25,986
Woo-hoo! Hey, GUYS-

463
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:27,780
Spider-Man. Spider-Man.

464
00:48:27,947 --> 00:48:30,157
Hey there. Hi.

465
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:33,244
- Kiss him.
- Kiss him.

466
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:36,163
Kiss him. Kiss him. Kiss him.

467
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:38,749
Go ahead, lay one on me.

468
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:40,668
- Really?
- Yeah, they'll love it.

469
00:48:40,835 --> 00:48:42,336
- Kiss her.
- Kiss him.

470
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:43,838
No, Spider-Man, no.

471
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,881
All right.

472
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:57,351
Hope Pete's getting a shot of this.

473
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:02,648
Ack!

474
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:06,277
- Hey, hey, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

475
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:54,241
Hey, man, we got something on the roof.

476
00:49:58,329 --> 00:49:59,788
Oh!

477
00:50:16,931 --> 00:50:18,098
Jig's up, pal.

478
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:21,727
I don't wanna hurt you.
Leave now.

479
00:50:21,894 --> 00:50:25,105
I guess you haven't heard.
I'm the sheriff around these parts.

480
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:26,357
Okay.

481
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:31,570
Uh-oh.

482
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:06,522
Help!

483
00:51:40,973 --> 00:51:43,517
Where do all these guys come from?

484
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:38,405
I'm sorry, I don't speak--

485
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:41,909
But this is a French restaurant, non?

486
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:44,745
- Oui?
- Ha, ha!

487
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:47,122
- Name, please?
- Parker, Peter.

488
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:53,045
Ah. Here we are.

489
00:52:53,212 --> 00:52:55,422
Table for two. Parker.

490
00:52:56,590 --> 00:53:00,636
- Parker.
- That is what I said: Parker.

491
00:53:03,055 --> 00:53:05,015
Um, I have a request.

492
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:08,227
My girlfriend will be coming
and I have this ring.

493
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:10,688
Ah!

494
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,485
Hello.

495
00:53:16,652 --> 00:53:19,530
Oh, so you want to
pop the question tonight, huh?

496
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:22,533
Yes, and I wanna do
something very special.

497
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:25,160
I love it. Romance.

498
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:26,912
I am French.

499
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:32,459
When I signal you, if you'd bring
some champagne with the ring--

500
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:34,962
- In the bottom of her glass?
- Perfect.

501
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:38,173
Also, I thought
at the same time...

502
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:41,927
...if the musicians
would play this song...

503
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:45,097
Their favorite.

504
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:47,891
And take good care of the ring.

505
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:50,602
Oui, with my life, monsieur.

506
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:54,898
I like you.

507
00:53:58,444 --> 00:53:59,945
Thank you.

508
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:09,246
Oh.

509
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:13,417
Okay, so...

510
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:16,253
Oh, would you like some champagne?

511
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:22,885
How'd that get in there? Heh.

512
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:25,596
Oh, don't cry.

513
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:31,769
Hi.

514
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:34,897
Look at you.
Wow, beautiful.

515
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:36,648
Thanks.

516
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:42,446
This place in your budget?

517
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:44,823
Oh, well, it's a special occasion.

518
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:47,034
You're on Broadway.

519
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:50,412
I don't feel like
much of a star tonight.

520
00:54:50,579 --> 00:54:53,874
Well, you are a star.
And you've earned it.

521
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:55,667
Peter...

522
00:54:57,211 --> 00:54:59,171
...you have no idea
how I feel right now.

523
00:54:59,338 --> 00:55:02,382
Oh, no, I know
exactly how you feel.

524
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:07,221
Listen, I have been through this.
It happens to me all the time.

525
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:09,389
I see Spider-Man posters
in the window...

526
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:11,892
...kids running around
with me on their sweaters--

527
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:13,727
Big Halloween item.

528
00:55:13,894 --> 00:55:16,730
I don't know, I guess I've
become something of an icon.

529
00:55:16,897 --> 00:55:21,568
Like yesterday, they kept screaming,
"Spider-Man, Spider-Man."

530
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:25,823
I don't know, you know,
I mean, I'm thinking to myself:

531
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:29,910
"I'm just a nerdy kid from Queens.
Do I deserve this?"

532
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:33,330
Hi, Pete. Ha, ha.

533
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:34,748
Hi.

534
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:45,551
Hi, my parents and I
were just having dinner here.

535
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:48,428
- Hello. I'm Gwen Stacy.
- Hi.

536
00:55:48,637 --> 00:55:51,014
This is Mary Jane Watson.

537
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:56,395
Oh! Oh, it's so nice to finally meet you.
Pete talks about you all the time.

538
00:55:56,562 --> 00:55:58,272
Oh?

539
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:02,442
Gwen is my lab partner
in Dr. Connors' class.

540
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:05,779
Pete's something of a genius.
I'd be completely lost without him.

541
00:56:05,946 --> 00:56:07,865
Which actually reminds me...

542
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:11,201
...Pete, if you've got a picture
of my kiss with Spider-Man...

543
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:13,620
...could you bring it to class?

544
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:17,958
I'd really love it. Heh.
For my portfolio.

545
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:21,086
After all, who gets
kissed by Spider-Man, right?

546
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:23,589
I can't imagine.

547
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:27,467
Well, it was lovely to meet you.

548
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:29,928
- Good night.
- Good night.

549
00:56:41,148 --> 00:56:43,108
Oh, she's in my science class.

550
00:56:43,275 --> 00:56:45,152
It's not her best subject.

551
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:48,739
What?

552
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:51,158
How come you
never mentioned her?

553
00:56:52,576 --> 00:56:54,995
She's your lab partner?

554
00:56:55,162 --> 00:56:57,289
You saved her life?

555
00:56:57,456 --> 00:56:58,790
She thinks you're a genius...

556
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:02,336
...and she had her polished
fingernails all over you?

557
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:04,004
Or didn't you notice?

558
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:08,717
And she gave Spider-Man
the key to the city.

559
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:12,012
I'll never forget that.

560
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:17,100
She's just a girl in my class.

561
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:19,019
Let me ask you something.

562
00:57:19,186 --> 00:57:21,188
When you kissed her...

563
00:57:21,355 --> 00:57:23,774
...who was kissing her?

564
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:26,652
Spider-Man or Peter?

565
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:29,738
- What do you mean?
- You know exactly what I mean.

566
00:57:29,905 --> 00:57:32,240
That was our kiss.

567
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:33,951
Why would you do that?

568
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:37,996
You must have known
how it'd make me feel.

569
00:57:38,497 --> 00:57:42,000
- Do you wanna push me away?
- Push you away?

570
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:44,711
Why would I wanna push
you away? I love you.

571
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:48,840
You're my girlfriend.
She's a girl in my class, M.J.

572
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,469
I don't feel very well.
I'm sorry, I have to go.

573
00:57:52,636 --> 00:57:53,720
No, w--

574
00:57:55,347 --> 00:57:57,975
- Where are you going?
- Please, don't follow me.

575
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,063
Here we are.

576
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:42,602
Hi, it's
M.J. Sing your song at the beep. Beep.

577
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:46,523
Hello. Uh...

578
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:51,862
I wish you'd pick up the phone.
I don't know what's going on or...

579
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:55,032
I don't know
if you got the messages or what.

580
00:58:55,574 --> 00:58:56,742
But, uh...

581
00:58:57,951 --> 00:59:00,746
I just wanna talk to you.

582
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:04,291
Okay, call me. Bye.

583
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:17,179
- Hello?
- Mr. Parker?

584
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:18,472
Yeah?

585
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:21,141
This is Detective Neil Garrett
from the 32nd Precinct.

586
00:59:21,308 --> 00:59:23,060
I'm calling on behalf
of Captain Stacy.

587
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:25,645
He would like you to come down
to the station to speak with him.

588
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:29,316
Originally, we thought
that this man, Dennis Carradine...

589
00:59:29,483 --> 00:59:31,359
...was your husband's killer.

590
00:59:31,735 --> 00:59:33,403
We were wrong.

591
00:59:33,904 --> 00:59:34,988
What?

592
00:59:35,155 --> 00:59:37,991
Turns out Mr. Carradine
was only an accomplice.

593
00:59:38,158 --> 00:59:40,577
The actual killer is still at large.

594
00:59:40,744 --> 00:59:42,454
What are you talking about?

595
00:59:42,621 --> 00:59:44,414
This is the man
who killed your husband.

596
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:51,171
His name is Flint Marko.

597
00:59:51,338 --> 00:59:54,341
He's a small-time crook
who's been in and out of prison.

598
00:59:54,508 --> 00:59:55,967
You got this wrong.

599
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:57,344
Two days ago he escaped.

600
00:59:58,303 --> 01:00:00,847
Evidently, he confessed
his guilt to a cellmate...

601
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:04,851
...and we have a couple of witnesses
who will corroborate the story.

602
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:18,949
No, wait, son.
You don't wanna do this.

603
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:24,121
No!

604
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:35,841
Hey, get in!
What are you doing?

605
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:56,528
Would you put these
photos away, please?

606
01:00:56,695 --> 01:00:58,947
I'm sorry, Mrs. Parker.
I know this isn't easy...

607
01:00:59,114 --> 01:01:01,575
...but, please, be patient with us.

608
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:03,577
We're doing ourjob.
We will catch him.

609
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:05,412
No, you're not doing your job.

610
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:08,373
I watched my uncle die,
and we chased down the wrong man.

611
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:11,585
Now you're telling me you had suspicions
for two years? Witnesses?

612
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:13,920
- Why weren't we told about this?
- Settle down.

613
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:15,839
I have no intention of settling down.

614
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:18,592
This man killed my uncle,
and he's still out there!

615
01:01:27,601 --> 01:01:29,102
L-20 Parkway.

616
01:01:29,269 --> 01:01:31,730
All officers in the vicinity,
please report.

617
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:33,565
We have an abandoned vehicle...

618
01:01:33,732 --> 01:01:36,026
...and an elderly man
in the middle of the street.

619
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:38,486
Sorry, Wabash Avenue.

620
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:42,782
Peter, it's M.J.

621
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:46,244
I'm not here about
what happened at dinner.

622
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:47,621
Just please open up.

623
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:57,631
Aunt May called me.
She told me about what happened.

624
01:01:57,797 --> 01:01:59,466
She's worried about you.

625
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:01,635
I'm worried about you.

626
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:03,303
Don't be. I'm ﬁne.

627
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:05,847
I don't want you
to do something stupid.

628
01:02:06,014 --> 01:02:08,475
Like try to find my uncle's killer?

629
01:02:08,642 --> 01:02:11,102
And do something you'll regret.

630
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:14,147
Like with that other guy.

631
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:18,026
He had a gun on me.
I made a move and he fell. I told you that.

632
01:02:18,193 --> 01:02:19,527
I'm not accusing you
of anything.

633
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:21,446
10-22, auto at 556--

634
01:02:21,613 --> 01:02:25,533
- Will you turn that thing off?
- Crossing 5-6 to 5-7.

635
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:30,538
Yeah, Central, this is Car 3-9
responding to your Sixth Avenue call.

636
01:02:30,705 --> 01:02:34,125
Peter, I'm here
because I care about you.

637
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:37,837
And I know that you made a mistake
and that you feel guilty...

638
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:41,508
...but I wanna be here for you.

639
01:02:41,675 --> 01:02:44,844
Okay. I get it. Thank you.

640
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:47,639
But I'm fine. I--

641
01:02:47,806 --> 01:02:49,641
I don't need your help.

642
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:59,901
Everybody needs help
sometimes, Peter.

643
01:03:00,068 --> 01:03:01,903
Even Spider-Man.

644
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:12,455
Ninety X-ray, 98.

645
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:19,296
Two-four King, respond
to 1031 at 642 Madison Ave.

646
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:24,384
One-three Thomas,
respond to 1020 at 540 East 107.

647
01:03:24,551 --> 01:03:28,388
Male complainant inside apartment.
May be on first floor.

648
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:35,729
Three Henry 10-11,
I have a residence. 73818...

649
01:04:35,622 --> 01:04:37,290
Don't hurt me.
Just give me a chance!

650
01:04:37,457 --> 01:04:40,418
What about my uncle?
Did you give him a chance?

651
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:41,711
Did you?

652
01:04:53,932 --> 01:04:55,767
Where am I?

653
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:13,660
What is this?

654
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:17,497
I feel...

655
01:05:20,083 --> 01:05:22,001
Wow.

656
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:24,337
This feels good.

657
01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:35,390
Whoo!

658
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:38,143
Yeah!

659
01:05:44,399 --> 01:05:46,067
Whoo!

660
01:05:54,367 --> 01:05:55,994
This is something else.

661
01:05:58,079 --> 01:05:59,372
What do you think?

662
01:05:59,539 --> 01:06:01,624
I've never seen anything like it.

663
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:03,626
I'm a physicist, not a biologist...

664
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:06,504
...but let me look at it in the morning.
Run some tests.

665
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:07,881
Can we do that now?

666
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:15,013
It seems to like you.

667
01:06:17,515 --> 01:06:20,101
- Don't let any of that get on you.
- Why not?

668
01:06:20,268 --> 01:06:22,854
It has the characteristics
of a symbiote...

669
01:06:23,021 --> 01:06:26,149
...which needs to bond
to a host to survive.

670
01:06:26,316 --> 01:06:29,903
And sometimes these things
in nature, when they bind...

671
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:32,489
...they can be hard to unbind.

672
01:06:33,698 --> 01:06:35,867
Bank robbery in progress...

673
01:06:36,034 --> 01:06:37,744
...First Eastern Bank at 202 Bismark.

674
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:41,706
Another sandstorm is reported in the
vicinity. All cars proceed with caution.

675
01:06:41,873 --> 01:06:43,541
Marko.

676
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:38,304
Whoa.

677
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:40,974
Buddy, love the new outfit.

678
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:43,142
This is exactly what I need
to scoop Parker.

679
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:45,103
Give me some of that web action.

680
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:48,982
See you, chump.

681
01:07:50,525 --> 01:07:52,318
What the hell?

682
01:08:32,066 --> 01:08:33,151
Flint Marko.

683
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:38,990
- What do you want from me?
- Remember Ben Parker?

684
01:08:39,741 --> 01:08:42,785
The old man you shot
down in cold blood?

685
01:08:44,245 --> 01:08:46,039
What does it matter to you,
anyway?

686
01:08:47,749 --> 01:08:49,167
Everything!

687
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:29,207
It's time to pay, Marko!

688
01:10:39,193 --> 01:10:41,154
Good riddance.

689
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:04,719
- Rent.
- Not now.

690
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:07,722
Listen, it's a free country.
It's not rent-free country.

691
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:10,057
- Leave me alone.
- Give me rent.

692
01:11:10,224 --> 01:11:13,227
You'll get your rent
when you fix this damn door!

693
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:26,324
That wasn't cool.

694
01:11:26,657 --> 01:11:30,745
He is a good boy.

695
01:11:32,413 --> 01:11:34,373
He must be in some
kind of trouble.

696
01:12:22,463 --> 01:12:25,800
Flint Marko,
the man who killed Uncle Ben...

697
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:29,136
...he was killed last night.

698
01:12:29,303 --> 01:12:30,805
Oh, my.

699
01:12:31,597 --> 01:12:32,640
What happened?

700
01:12:33,266 --> 01:12:34,725
Spider-Man killed him.

701
01:12:36,435 --> 01:12:37,812
Spider-Man?

702
01:12:38,646 --> 01:12:40,731
I don't understand.

703
01:12:40,898 --> 01:12:43,609
Spider-Man doesn't kill people.

704
01:12:45,152 --> 01:12:47,071
What happened?

705
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:51,492
I, uh...

706
01:12:52,326 --> 01:12:53,703
He--

707
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:56,038
He was...

708
01:13:00,167 --> 01:13:03,087
I thought that you'd feel...

709
01:13:05,673 --> 01:13:07,633
He deserved it, didn't he?

710
01:13:08,301 --> 01:13:10,011
I don't think it's for us to say...

711
01:13:10,177 --> 01:13:14,181
...whether a person deserves
to live or die.

712
01:13:14,765 --> 01:13:17,476
But, Aunt May,
he killed Uncle Ben.

713
01:13:17,643 --> 01:13:20,187
Uncle Ben meant the world to us.

714
01:13:20,354 --> 01:13:23,733
But he wouldn't want us
living one second...

715
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:26,611
...with revenge in our hearts.

716
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:31,490
It's like a poison. It can--

717
01:13:32,283 --> 01:13:34,410
It can take you over.

718
01:13:36,287 --> 01:13:41,292
Before you know it,
turn us into something ugly.

719
01:13:55,222 --> 01:13:57,975
- He said it was a good idea.
- Yeah.

720
01:14:42,937 --> 01:14:44,105
Hello?

721
01:14:44,271 --> 01:14:45,815
Hey, Harry, it's M.J.

722
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:47,066
Hi.

723
01:14:47,233 --> 01:14:48,651
I need some company.

724
01:14:48,818 --> 01:14:51,278
Are you doing anything?
Can I stop by?

725
01:14:51,445 --> 01:14:53,489
Yeah, sure, come on over.

726
01:14:53,656 --> 01:14:55,950
Okay. Are you sure it's okay?

727
01:14:56,117 --> 01:14:58,744
No, I'm not doing anything.
Please, come over.

728
01:14:58,911 --> 01:15:01,580
- Okay, I'll see you soon.
- Great.

729
01:15:01,747 --> 01:15:03,165
Bye.

730
01:15:04,125 --> 01:15:06,335
- Bernard.
- Yes, Mr. Osborn?

731
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:08,754
We're having a guest.
Can you get some food?

732
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:11,132
- A guest?
- Yeah, a guest.

733
01:15:11,298 --> 01:15:14,635
- A "guest" guest?
- Will you just get some food?

734
01:15:14,802 --> 01:15:16,470
Right away, sir.

735
01:15:28,065 --> 01:15:29,233
Hi.

736
01:15:32,403 --> 01:15:34,864
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

737
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:37,491
Come on.

738
01:16:01,265 --> 01:16:03,559
- I hope you like peppers.

- Well, we can use that part.
- Um, right.

757
01:17:12,002 --> 01:17:13,963
You've been dreaming.

758
01:17:14,130 --> 01:17:17,341
Nothing like a little self-deception
to get you through the night.

759
01:17:17,508 --> 01:17:20,344
- All right.
- When did you write that?

760
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:23,305
- Twelfth grade.
- It's intense.

761

- So you want the part?
- I'd love to be in your play.

It's yours.

763
01:17:30,938 --> 01:17:34,275
You know, there's not even a scar.

764
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:37,528
Barely.

765
01:17:55,004 --> 01:17:56,547
- Sorry.
- Me too.

766
01:17:56,714 --> 01:18:00,843
- I didn't mean to do that.
- No, it's okay. Please, forgive me.

767
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:03,220
Mary Jane.

Mary Jane.

769
01:18:07,349 --> 01:18:10,102
- Mary Jane, please.
- I'm sorry.

770
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:11,854
Just--

771
01:18:23,908 --> 01:18:27,244
You've taken your eye off the ball.

772
01:18:33,584 --> 01:18:35,044
Harry.

773
01:18:48,057 --> 01:18:49,350
What have you done?

774
01:18:52,061 --> 01:18:53,562
Avenge me!

775
01:18:56,732 --> 01:19:00,819
- My father, he died, right?
- Yeah.

776
01:19:00,986 --> 01:19:03,197
Just Wish I could
remember more about him.

777
01:19:03,364 --> 01:19:06,408
Well, he loved you.
That's the main thing.

778
01:19:06,575 --> 01:19:09,662
I swear on my father's grave,
Spider-Man will pay.

779
01:19:10,496 --> 01:19:12,164
Harry.

780
01:19:13,958 --> 01:19:15,918
Remember me?

781
01:19:17,795 --> 01:19:20,673
Yes, Father. I remember.

782
01:19:20,839 --> 01:19:24,134
I was right about her.
About Peter.

783
01:19:24,301 --> 01:19:26,512
About everything.

784
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:30,683
You know what you must do.

785
01:19:48,284 --> 01:19:50,786
Hi, it's me. Sing your song at the beep.

786
01:19:52,121 --> 01:19:54,498
Hey, M.J. It's Peter.

787
01:19:54,665 --> 01:19:56,375
Uh...

788
01:19:56,542 --> 01:19:59,461
I wanna talk to you
about last night.

789
01:20:00,212 --> 01:20:02,339
I don't know what I was thinking.

790
01:20:02,506 --> 01:20:07,303
I know you were just there
to help and I, uh...

791
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:10,472
I don't know. I wanna see you.

792
01:20:14,977 --> 01:20:18,731
If you want Peter to live,
you're gonna do something for me.

793
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:24,695
Yeah?

794
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:30,868
Hi, Pete.
There's a phone call.

795
01:20:32,036 --> 01:20:34,747
Ursula. Hey.

796
01:20:34,913 --> 01:20:38,125
- Listen, I really shouldn't have spoken--
- Don't worry about it.

797
01:20:38,292 --> 01:20:40,002
You're a good boy.

798
01:20:41,253 --> 01:20:43,672
- It's Mary Jane.
- Thanks.

799
01:20:45,632 --> 01:20:47,968
I put the phone on top of the thing.

800
01:20:48,135 --> 01:20:51,138
Thanks. Okay.

801
01:20:53,223 --> 01:20:54,808
- Hey.
- Hi.

802
01:20:54,975 --> 01:20:57,644
Oh, I'm so glad you called.
I've been trying to--

803
01:20:57,811 --> 01:21:00,606
- Can you meet me?
- You bet.

804
01:21:00,773 --> 01:21:03,192
- Now?
- Okay. Where?

805
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:05,194
At the bridge in the park.

806
01:21:05,361 --> 01:21:06,695
-On my Way-
-Okay.

807
01:21:06,862 --> 01:21:09,156
Okay. Hey. I love you.

808
01:21:29,218 --> 01:21:31,220
You look beautiful.

809
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:34,098
Peonies.

810
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:39,228
- You okay?
- No.

811
01:21:40,229 --> 01:21:42,231
There's something
I have to tell you, Pete.

812
01:21:42,773 --> 01:21:44,233
Okay.

813
01:21:45,484 --> 01:21:47,111
It's not working.

814
01:21:48,195 --> 01:21:49,780
You and me.

815
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:52,282
What?

816
01:21:52,658 --> 01:21:54,993
I don't wanna see you anymore.

817
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:57,413
What are you talking about?

818
01:21:57,579 --> 01:21:59,623
I don't know.

819
01:22:02,376 --> 01:22:04,128
I'm lonely.

820
01:22:05,379 --> 01:22:07,589
You aren't there for me.

821
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:11,176
I can't do this.

822
01:22:11,343 --> 01:22:17,099
- It's over.
- No. Please. Please don't say that.

823
01:22:17,599 --> 01:22:20,436
I know I've been selfish,
but I can do better. I can change.

824
01:22:20,602 --> 01:22:24,273
- It's not that simple.
- We love each other. I love you.

825
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:26,567
We have problems.
When people have problems...

826
01:22:26,733 --> 01:22:29,445
...they work it out.
They talk to each other.

827
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:35,451
Look, you see?

828
01:22:35,617 --> 01:22:36,994
Oh...

829
01:22:37,494 --> 01:22:39,538
You know what this is?

830
01:22:40,747 --> 01:22:43,959
- You know what I want for us?
- There's someone else.

831
01:22:44,126 --> 01:22:46,920
I've fallen in love with someone else.

832
01:23:08,609 --> 01:23:10,152
Bravo.

833
01:24:45,497 --> 01:24:47,708
Spider-Man used to make me feel safe.

834
01:24:47,874 --> 01:24:49,793
Now I'm afraid
to walk home from work.

835
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:51,420
My son thought
the world of this guy.

836
01:24:51,587 --> 01:24:53,672
I have a 9-year-old daughter,
loves Spider-Man.

837
01:24:53,839 --> 01:24:55,465
Who's she supposed to look up to?

838
01:24:55,632 --> 01:24:58,218
This is the guy
they gave the key to the city to?

839
01:24:58,385 --> 01:25:01,221
I'm gonna put some dirt
in your eye.

840
01:25:03,223 --> 01:25:04,850
Cheers to the new staff photographer.

841
01:25:05,017 --> 01:25:06,393
Hey, I just got lucky.

842
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:08,312
This is so wonderful for you.

843
01:25:08,478 --> 01:25:12,107
Well, you might wanna tell J.J.
to make a little more wall space.

844
01:25:17,195 --> 01:25:20,616
Wow, good morning.
It's a beautiful day, huh?

845
01:25:20,782 --> 01:25:23,243
What was it you said?
I'll never get that picture?

846
01:25:23,994 --> 01:25:26,330
- There's your hero.
- Huh.

847
01:25:27,331 --> 01:25:30,876
- I never thought he'd really do that.
- See? Right there.

848
01:25:31,043 --> 01:25:33,670
You made a judgment call.
You gotta see it as it is.

849
01:25:33,837 --> 01:25:35,213
It's funny you should say that...

850
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:41,637
...because I was looking through some
old photos and it looks very, uh, similar.

851
01:25:42,763 --> 01:25:45,682
Okay. Ha-ha-ha.
Well, I gotta get back to work.

852
01:25:46,892 --> 01:25:49,853
- You're trash, Brock.
- Excuse me?

853
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:51,980
Your picture's a fake.

854
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:57,110
Oh, Parker,
you are such a boy scout.

855
01:25:57,277 --> 01:25:59,279
When are you gonna
give a guy a break?

856
01:26:01,365 --> 01:26:03,533
You want forgiveness?
Get religion.

857
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:07,287
- What's going on here?
- Are you guys all right?

858
01:26:09,790 --> 01:26:14,002
Heh. Yeah. No, we--
We're just horsing around.

859
01:26:14,461 --> 01:26:18,507
Look, I'm begging you.
If you do this, I will lose everything.

860
01:26:18,674 --> 01:26:20,926
There's not a paper in town
that will hire me.

861
01:26:21,093 --> 01:26:23,428
You should've
thought of that earlier.

862
01:26:24,137 --> 01:26:26,390
What are you doing, Peter?

863
01:26:26,556 --> 01:26:30,769
Show this to your editor.
Tell him to check his source next time.

864
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:38,527
It's a fake.

865
01:26:38,694 --> 01:26:42,656
Empire State Photographic
Department confirms it.

866
01:26:46,284 --> 01:26:48,161
Pack your things.
Get out of my building.

867
01:26:48,662 --> 01:26:50,789
- I was just trying--
- You're fired.

868
01:26:52,332 --> 01:26:54,668
You know we're gonna
have to print a retraction now.

869
01:26:54,835 --> 01:26:56,920
I haven't printed
a retraction in 20 years.

870
01:27:27,617 --> 01:27:31,913
She says that she's lonely,
that I'm not there for her.

871
01:27:33,415 --> 01:27:35,667
There's another guy.

872
01:27:38,628 --> 01:27:40,422
Well, how you holding up?

873
01:27:41,173 --> 01:27:42,883
Not good.

874
01:27:44,926 --> 01:27:47,846
Harry, I was gonna propose to her.

875
01:27:48,513 --> 01:27:50,015
Really?

876
01:27:52,267 --> 01:27:56,229
Well, she's been going through
a tough time lately. Career.

877
01:27:56,396 --> 01:27:59,232
I mean, a singing waitress
at a jazz club?

878
01:27:59,399 --> 01:28:02,402
It's not exactly what
she had in mind for herself.

879
01:28:02,569 --> 01:28:05,655
Singing waitress? What are you--?
What are you talking about?

880
01:28:05,822 --> 01:28:10,368
Well, she was fired from the show.
Didn't she tell you?

881
01:28:10,744 --> 01:28:12,120
She was fired?

882
01:28:13,789 --> 01:28:18,960
She was ﬁred and she told you?
She didn't tell me?

883
01:28:20,587 --> 01:28:23,048
Well, that's why
I asked you here, Pete.

884
01:28:24,299 --> 01:28:26,301
I'm the other guy.

885
01:28:28,136 --> 01:28:29,888
What?

886
01:28:30,055 --> 01:28:33,058
Look, she came to me
one afternoon, troubled.

887
01:28:33,225 --> 01:28:36,144
She needed someone
and I was there for her.

888
01:28:36,978 --> 01:28:40,065
I've always loved her, Pete.
You know that.

889
01:28:40,232 --> 01:28:42,025
It just...

890
01:28:42,192 --> 01:28:44,236
...started.

891
01:28:51,618 --> 01:28:54,913
I don't believe this.
I don't-- Ahem. I don't believe you.

892
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:57,457
Look, I'm really sorry.

893
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,336
I just thought you should know.

894
01:29:09,511 --> 01:29:12,889
- Can I warm you up?
- Yes, please.

895
01:29:14,516 --> 01:29:16,017
How's the pie?

896
01:29:17,060 --> 01:29:18,728
So good.

897
01:29:48,008 --> 01:29:49,634
What took you so long?

898
01:29:50,552 --> 01:29:52,262
That was quite a performance today.

899
01:29:52,429 --> 01:29:55,682
Ha, ha, ha.
Well, it wasn't all a show.

900
01:29:55,849 --> 01:29:57,058
She did come to me.

901
01:29:57,434 --> 01:29:59,936
Yeah, I got the story.

902
01:30:00,103 --> 01:30:02,314
I am really gonna enjoy this.

903
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:05,734
Not as much as I enjoyed it
when Mary Jane kissed me.

904
01:30:08,111 --> 01:30:10,614
It was just like she used to kiss me.

905
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:12,490
That taste...

906
01:30:14,117 --> 01:30:15,410
Strawberries.

907
01:30:51,029 --> 01:30:52,614
How'd you like that, Spidey?

908
01:30:56,451 --> 01:30:57,786
That all you got?

909
01:31:05,043 --> 01:31:07,587
- Stings, doesn't it?
- I protected you in high school.

910
01:31:07,754 --> 01:31:09,965
- Now I'm gonna kick your little ass.
- Ooh!

911
01:31:57,262 --> 01:31:59,180
Gonna kill me
like you killed my father?

912
01:31:59,347 --> 01:32:01,516
I'm done trying to convince you.

913
01:32:02,308 --> 01:32:05,770
You took him from me.
He loved me.

914
01:32:05,937 --> 01:32:09,858
No. He despised you.

915
01:32:10,025 --> 01:32:12,235
You were an embarrassment
to him.

916
01:32:13,903 --> 01:32:15,196
Oh.

917
01:32:16,031 --> 01:32:19,826
Look at little Goblin Junior.
Gonna cry?

918
01:32:49,064 --> 01:32:50,106
Hello.

919
01:32:50,273 --> 01:32:51,900
Mr. Parker, Dr. Connors here.

920
01:32:52,067 --> 01:32:55,153
Oh, Dr. Connors. How are you?

921
01:32:56,529 --> 01:32:59,574
Quite a specimen you left me, Parker.

922
01:32:59,991 --> 01:33:04,496
Its chemistry is not unlike
the chondritic meteorites of the '70s.

923
01:33:04,662 --> 01:33:05,872
Thanks.

924
01:33:06,039 --> 01:33:08,583
- Mmm. That's good.
- You know what, Parker?

925
01:33:10,502 --> 01:33:13,296
- Parker?
- Get me some milk.

926
01:33:14,089 --> 01:33:17,634
- It amplifies characteristics of its host.
- Mmm.

927
01:33:17,801 --> 01:33:21,387
- Hey, give me another cookie.
- Especially aggression.

928
01:33:21,721 --> 01:33:24,432
- Mm.
- This could be dangerous.

929
01:33:24,599 --> 01:33:28,103
Peter, you didn't keep any,
did you?

930
01:33:28,269 --> 01:33:29,312
You got any with nuts?

931
01:33:29,479 --> 01:33:31,981
Um, I have some nuts.
I could make some.

932
01:33:32,148 --> 01:33:33,858
- Go make me some.
- Peter?

933
01:33:34,025 --> 01:33:36,569
No, no, no. Course not.

934
01:33:50,959 --> 01:33:52,836
These shots are so good.

935
01:33:53,002 --> 01:33:55,547
I'd love to shoot you sometime.

936
01:33:56,047 --> 01:33:59,467
Peter Parker. Peter.

937
01:33:59,634 --> 01:34:03,930
Parker! Miss Brant, that's not
the position I hired you for.

938
01:34:04,097 --> 01:34:05,640
Black-suit Spider-Man.

939
01:34:07,100 --> 01:34:09,269
Peter, these are incredible.

940
01:34:09,435 --> 01:34:12,313
- We gotta have these, Jonah.
- I'll pay you the usual rate.

941
01:34:14,232 --> 01:34:16,860
If you want the shots,
I'll take the staff job...

942
01:34:17,026 --> 01:34:18,862
...double the money.

Penny.

Honey, look at me.

958
01:35:55,250 --> 01:35:57,961
I know your father's
made promises to you.

959
01:35:59,295 --> 01:36:02,715
But sometimes he makes promises
that he can't always keep.

960
01:36:03,716 --> 01:36:07,220
I don't know. Something seems
to always get in his way I guess.

961
01:36:09,764 --> 01:36:11,975
I just don't want you
to get your hopes up.

962
01:36:14,894 --> 01:36:16,980
He'll only break your heart.

963
01:36:19,774 --> 01:36:21,859
Go get your things, okay?

964
01:37:22,837 --> 01:37:26,132
- Penny, come on.
- Coming.

965
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:54,600
I swear to you...

966
01:37:55,370 --> 01:37:57,080
He won't stop me again.

967
01:37:58,664 --> 01:38:01,334
You are really gonna dig this joint.

968
01:38:02,627 --> 01:38:04,670
Do you think I'm--?
I'm dressed all right?

969
01:38:04,837 --> 01:38:06,422
Too fancy or too...?

970
01:38:06,589 --> 01:38:09,300
Are you kidding me?
You're looking fine, babe.

971
01:38:09,467 --> 01:38:12,178
Heh. Thank you. Ha, ha.

972
01:38:12,345 --> 01:38:14,847
Love that little giggle.

973
01:38:17,308 --> 01:38:19,227

Oh, I hope we can get a table.

- Yeah.

- Oh, no, no. I'll-- I'll be okay.

Oh!

Yeah!

999
01:41:13,985 --> 01:41:15,695
That was all for her?

1000
01:41:24,370 --> 01:41:25,871
I'm so sorry.

1001
01:41:38,342 --> 01:41:40,803
- You all right, Mary Jane?
- I'm fine.

1002
01:41:40,970 --> 01:41:42,388
Okay.

Hey-

1004
01:41:49,020 --> 01:41:50,313
What's wrong with you?

1005
01:41:51,606 --> 01:41:53,024
You.

1006
01:41:53,524 --> 01:41:56,527
- Can I help you, sir?
- No.

1007
01:41:56,694 --> 01:41:58,779
Is everything okay here, Paul?

1008
01:41:58,946 --> 01:42:01,198
Yeah, is everything okay here,
Paul?

1009
01:42:01,365 --> 01:42:03,743
- Take him out of here.
- Let's go, sir.

1010
01:42:03,909 --> 01:42:06,704
- Take your hand off of me.
- Now.

1011
01:42:06,871 --> 01:42:10,333
- Okay.
- Hey, get off. Let go.

1012
01:42:12,877 --> 01:42:15,421
- Peter, stop it! Aah.
- Unh!

1013
01:42:26,057 --> 01:42:27,475
Who are you?

1014
01:42:30,019 --> 01:42:31,562
I don't know.

1015
01:44:04,238 --> 01:44:06,157
It's Brock, sir.

1016
01:44:06,323 --> 01:44:08,784
Edward Brock Jr.

1017
01:44:10,453 --> 01:44:13,080
I come before you today...

1018
01:44:14,623 --> 01:44:16,250
...humbled...

1019
01:44:18,127 --> 01:44:20,254
...and humiliated...

1020
01:44:23,090 --> 01:44:25,301
...to ask you for one thing.

1021
01:44:30,973 --> 01:44:32,767
I want you to kill Peter Parker.

1022
01:45:23,776 --> 01:45:24,819
Parker.

1023
01:46:52,156 --> 01:46:54,575
End of the line, Spider-Man.

1024
01:46:58,621 --> 01:47:00,915
I want him dead too, Flint.

1025
01:47:01,457 --> 01:47:03,792
That's why I've been
looking for you.

1026
01:47:03,959 --> 01:47:07,212
Oh, yeah.
I know all about you.

1027
01:47:07,379 --> 01:47:11,634
Like the fact that Spider-Man
won't let you help your poor daughter.

1028
01:47:11,800 --> 01:47:15,095
It's just-- That doesn't
seem right to me.

1029
01:47:15,262 --> 01:47:20,184
Look, I wanna kill the spider,
you wanna kill the spider.

1030
01:47:20,351 --> 01:47:23,646
Together, he doesn't
stand a chance.

1031
01:47:24,647 --> 01:47:26,732
Interested?

1032
01:47:28,108 --> 01:47:29,652
Yeah.

1033
01:48:31,505 --> 01:48:32,548
So...

1034
01:48:34,091 --> 01:48:35,384
...where to?

1035
01:48:36,510 --> 01:48:38,220
All New York is holding its breath...

1036
01:48:38,387 --> 01:48:41,056
...as the hostage crisis
continues to unfold.

1037
01:48:42,766 --> 01:48:44,059
Just 30 minutes ago...

1038
01:48:44,226 --> 01:48:46,311
...police came across
this startling sight:

1039
01:48:46,478 --> 01:48:48,605
A young woman,
held hostage in a taxi...

1040
01:48:48,772 --> 01:48:51,066
...suspended 80 stories
above the ground...

1041
01:48:51,233 --> 01:48:54,111
...in what appears to be a giant web.

1042
01:48:54,278 --> 01:48:56,905
Every attempt
by the police to rescue the hostage...

1043
01:48:57,072 --> 01:48:58,907
...has been thwarted by the Sandman.

1044
01:49:02,327 --> 01:49:03,579
Compounding the danger...

1045
01:49:03,746 --> 01:49:06,665
...is the appearance
of a strange black-suited ﬁgure.

1046
01:49:06,832 --> 01:49:10,502
Early reports had believed him
to be the black-suited Spider-Man...

1047
01:49:10,669 --> 01:49:14,256
...but he has now been identified
as something entirely different.

1048
01:49:15,883 --> 01:49:19,428
The hostage has been identified
as Mary Jane Watson...

1049
01:49:19,595 --> 01:49:23,682
...an actress recently seen
in a brief stint on Broadway.

1050
01:49:49,374 --> 01:49:51,794
We're now going to take you
live to the scene...

1051
01:49:51,960 --> 01:49:53,629
...with Jennifer Dugan. Jennifer?

1052
01:49:53,796 --> 01:49:56,340
We're only about a hundred
feet away now, Hal, and--

1053
01:49:56,507 --> 01:50:00,302
Wait. There seems to be some
kind of activity in the web.

1054
01:50:00,469 --> 01:50:04,056
They seem to be creating
some kind of gigantic lettering.

1055
01:50:07,059 --> 01:50:09,895
Apparently, Spider-Man's being
challenged to some sort of confrontation.

1056
01:50:10,062 --> 01:50:11,688
And that raises serious questions...

1057
01:50:11,855 --> 01:50:15,275
...about what kind of chance he'd
stand against such overwhelming--

1058
01:50:25,577 --> 01:50:26,954
Harry?

1059
01:50:30,499 --> 01:50:32,501
I need your help.

1060
01:50:32,918 --> 01:50:36,296
I can't take them both,
not by myself.

1061
01:50:42,803 --> 01:50:45,597
You don't deserve my help.

1062
01:50:48,475 --> 01:50:49,977
Harry...

1063
01:50:50,686 --> 01:50:52,688
...she needs us.

1064
01:50:57,276 --> 01:50:58,861
Get out.

1065
01:52:01,882 --> 01:52:03,133
Look.

1066
01:52:24,029 --> 01:52:27,532
Spider-Man! Spider-Man! Spider-Man!

1067
01:52:33,080 --> 01:52:35,040
He seems to have
come out of nowhere...

1068
01:52:35,207 --> 01:52:37,209
...to answer the prayers of the city...

1069
01:52:37,376 --> 01:52:39,419
...just when all hope seemed to be lost.

1070
01:52:45,342 --> 01:52:48,262
Peter. They're gonna kill us both.

1071
01:52:48,428 --> 01:52:50,806
- I'm gonna get you out of this.
- Watch out.

1072
01:53:01,358 --> 01:53:02,776
Hey, Parker.

1073
01:53:02,943 --> 01:53:04,236
My God. Eddie.

1074
01:53:04,444 --> 01:53:06,613
Ooh, my spider-sense is tingling...

1075
01:53:08,282 --> 01:53:11,034
...if you know what I'm talking about.
Heh, heh.

1076
01:53:30,095 --> 01:53:31,972
We can find a way to settle this.

1077
01:53:32,139 --> 01:53:33,598
You're so right.

1078
01:53:33,765 --> 01:53:37,269
I'm thinking humiliation.

1079
01:53:37,978 --> 01:53:40,314
Kind of like how
you humiliated me.

1080
01:53:41,148 --> 01:53:42,899
Do you remember?

1081
01:53:44,735 --> 01:53:47,529
Do you remember
what you did to me?

1082
01:54:03,003 --> 01:54:06,673
You made me lose my girl.
Now I'm gonna make you lose yours.

1083
01:54:08,508 --> 01:54:10,469
How's that sound, tiger?

1084
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:12,030
Hold on, Mary Jane!

1085
01:55:42,185 --> 01:55:44,521
Mary Jane!

1086
01:56:44,998 --> 01:56:48,752
It's hard to believe what's happening.

1087
01:56:48,919 --> 01:56:51,254
The brutality of it.

1088
01:56:52,005 --> 01:56:53,798
I don't know how
he can take any more.

1089
01:56:53,965 --> 01:56:57,511
This could be a tragic day
for the people of New York.

1090
01:56:57,677 --> 01:56:59,679
It could be the end of Spider-Man.

1091
01:57:15,195 --> 01:57:17,072
Hm?

1092
01:57:26,081 --> 01:57:28,333
- Awesome.
- Wicked cool.

1093
01:57:53,358 --> 01:57:54,818
You came.

1094
01:58:02,742 --> 01:58:04,828
Looks like just in the nick of time.

1095
01:58:04,995 --> 01:58:07,497
A couple minutes ago
wouldn't have been so bad either.

1096
01:58:07,664 --> 01:58:09,249
What are you gonna do?

1097
01:58:12,794 --> 01:58:14,671
I may need some help over here.

1098
01:58:14,838 --> 01:58:17,257
I'm a little busy right now.

1099
01:58:18,425 --> 01:58:20,176
Give me your hand.

1100
01:58:34,608 --> 01:58:37,485
Parker! Parker, where--?

1101
01:58:37,652 --> 01:58:39,237
I need a photographer.

1102
01:58:39,404 --> 01:58:40,697
Hey, kid, you want a job?

1103
01:58:40,864 --> 01:58:44,200
Why would I want a job?
I'm just a kid.

1104
01:58:44,367 --> 01:58:47,287
- All right, how much for the camera?
- One hundred bucks.

1105
01:58:47,454 --> 01:58:48,913
A hundred bucks?

1106
01:58:50,790 --> 01:58:54,544
All right, you little crook. Here.

1107
01:58:56,296 --> 01:58:57,631
What the--?

1108
01:58:59,591 --> 01:59:01,217
Film's extra.

1109
01:59:07,057 --> 01:59:08,850
Gotcha.

1110
01:59:16,858 --> 01:59:18,151
Pete, up top.

1111
01:59:38,004 --> 01:59:40,006
Mary Jane.

1112
01:59:42,175 --> 01:59:44,010
- This thing got any more?
- Hang on.

1113
01:59:44,177 --> 01:59:45,345
To what?

1114
01:59:49,724 --> 01:59:51,559
- Go, buddy.
- Got her.

1115
02:00:02,904 --> 02:00:03,947
You Okay?

1116
02:00:06,074 --> 02:00:07,617
Yeah.

1117
02:00:10,370 --> 02:00:12,747
- Good.
- Hey, Pete.

1118
02:00:15,041 --> 02:00:16,876
Am I interrupting?

1119
02:01:33,119 --> 02:01:34,954
Never wound...

1120
02:01:35,789 --> 02:01:37,832
...what you can't kill.

1121
02:01:41,628 --> 02:01:45,131
Eddie, the suit, you gotta take it off.

1122
02:01:45,298 --> 02:01:47,008
Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

1123
02:01:47,801 --> 02:01:49,552
Ah.

1124
02:01:49,928 --> 02:01:51,679
I know what it feels like.

1125
02:01:52,305 --> 02:01:53,932
It feels good.

1126
02:01:54,098 --> 02:01:56,643
The power. Everything.

1127
02:01:56,810 --> 02:01:59,312
But you'll lose yourself.

1128
02:01:59,854 --> 02:02:01,773
Let it go.

1129
02:02:01,940 --> 02:02:03,983
I like being bad.

1130
02:02:05,109 --> 02:02:06,861
It makes me happy.

1131
02:02:56,369 --> 02:02:57,453
Harry!

1132
02:04:10,485 --> 02:04:12,820
Peter. What are you doing?

1133
02:04:13,780 --> 02:04:15,615
No!

1134
02:04:17,367 --> 02:04:18,409
Eddie!

1135
02:04:37,887 --> 02:04:39,847
- Harry.
- Mary Jane.

1136
02:04:40,014 --> 02:04:41,849
- I'm gonna get help.
- No.

1137
02:04:42,684 --> 02:04:44,102
Stay.

1138
02:04:52,819 --> 02:04:55,113
I didn't want this.

1139
02:04:59,367 --> 02:05:01,619
But I had no choice.

1140
02:05:05,331 --> 02:05:07,458
We always have a choice.

1141
02:05:07,625 --> 02:05:09,836
You had a choice
when you killed my uncle.

1142
02:05:12,338 --> 02:05:13,923
My daughter was dying.

1143
02:05:16,509 --> 02:05:18,386
I needed money.

1144
02:05:23,182 --> 02:05:25,143
I was scared.

1145
02:05:32,650 --> 02:05:35,737
I told your uncle
all l wanted was the car.

1146
02:05:35,903 --> 02:05:37,864
- What is it?
- I need your car.

1147
02:05:38,364 --> 02:05:40,867
He said to me:

1148
02:05:41,034 --> 02:05:43,786
"Why don't you just put
down the gun and go home?"

1149
02:05:47,874 --> 02:05:50,877
I realize now
he was just trying to help me.

1150
02:05:57,592 --> 02:06:00,553
Then I saw my partner
running over with the cash.

1151
02:06:00,720 --> 02:06:01,888
And the gun was in my hand.

1152
02:06:13,566 --> 02:06:14,984
Get in!

1153
02:06:16,903 --> 02:06:19,238
Did a terrible thing to you...

1154
02:06:20,615 --> 02:06:24,035
...and I spent a lot of nights
wishing I could take it back.

1155
02:06:29,290 --> 02:06:31,876
I'm not asking you to forgive me.

1156
02:06:32,794 --> 02:06:35,129
I just want you to understand.

1157
02:06:44,931 --> 02:06:47,558
I've done terrible things too.

1158
02:07:03,825 --> 02:07:06,619
I didn't choose to be this.

1159
02:07:15,336 --> 02:07:17,839
The only thing left of me now...

1160
02:07:20,007 --> 02:07:21,926
...is my daughter.

1161
02:07:34,147 --> 02:07:36,107
I forgive you.

1162
02:08:19,483 --> 02:08:22,403
Hey, Pal How you doing?

1163
02:08:22,570 --> 02:08:24,197
Been better.

1164
02:08:25,740 --> 02:08:27,700
We'll get you through this.

1165
02:08:31,412 --> 02:08:32,914
No.

1166
02:08:40,588 --> 02:08:42,757
I should never have hurt you...

1167
02:08:44,634 --> 02:08:46,928
...said those things.

1168
02:08:48,596 --> 02:08:51,140
None of that matters, Peter.

1169
02:08:53,226 --> 02:08:54,977
You're my friend.

1170
02:08:59,732 --> 02:09:01,525
Best friend.

1171
02:09:20,419 --> 02:09:22,088
Harry.

1172
02:10:08,092 --> 02:10:10,261
Whatever comes our way...

1173
02:10:11,304 --> 02:10:15,516
...whatever battle we have raging
inside us, we always have a choice.

1174
02:10:17,643 --> 02:10:19,729
My friend Harry taught me that.

1175
02:10:19,895 --> 02:10:23,149
He chose to be the best of himself.

1176
02:10:23,983 --> 02:10:26,986
It's the choices
that make us who we are...

1177
02:10:27,153 --> 02:10:30,573
...and we can always choose
to do what's right.
