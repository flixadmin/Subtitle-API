I made a deal for you
to keep your ungrateful head

7
00:01:55,561 --> 00:01:57,495
on your ungrateful neck
a little while longer.

what am I grateful for?</i>

9
00:01:59,398 --> 00:02:01,165
The opportunity to live
and die at the Wall

10
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,167
as punishment for a crime
I did not commit?

11
00:02:03,202 --> 00:02:05,403
You threw your life away.
You threw it away.

12
00:02:05,437 --> 00:02:08,139
It's not a joke.
You understand that, don't you?

13
00:02:08,173 --> 00:02:10,875
Of course it's a joke,
just not a very funny one.

14

I couldn't...

15
00:02:15,614 --> 00:02:17,515
I couldn't listen to her

16
00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:19,951
standing there
telling her lies.

17
00:02:19,985 --> 00:02:21,352
I couldn't do it.

18
00:02:21,387 --> 00:02:23,955
You fell in love
with a whore.

19
00:02:23,989 --> 00:02:26,057
Yes, I fell in love
with a whore.

20
00:02:26,091 --> 00:02:29,827
And I was stupid enough to think
that she had fallen in love with me.

21
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:36,234
That deal you made,

22
00:02:36,268 --> 00:02:39,037
it was everything
Father wanted.

23

<i>You do see that?</i>

24

as his heir.</i>

25

<i>The future
Lord of the Rock.</i>

26
00:02:44,543 --> 00:02:47,211
And he ships me off
to Castle Black,

27
00:02:47,246 --> 00:02:49,047
out of sight at last.

28
00:02:50,482 --> 00:02:52,517
All so perfect.

29
00:02:54,553 --> 00:02:56,988
It felt good
to take that from him.

30
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:02,427
He knows I'm innocent and he's
willing to sacrifice me anyway.

31
00:03:02,461 --> 00:03:04,395
He's willing
to sacrifice any of us.

32
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,164
Not you.

33
00:03:06,198 --> 00:03:08,332
You're the golden son.

34
00:03:08,367 --> 00:03:10,701
You could kill a king,
lose a hand,

35
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:12,970
fuck your own sister,
you'll always be the golden son.

36
00:03:13,005 --> 00:03:14,439
Careful.

37
00:03:14,473 --> 00:03:16,841
I'm the last friend
you've got.

38
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,881
At least I got to tell
them what they really are.

39
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:26,050
Yes, brilliant speech.

40
00:03:26,085 --> 00:03:28,419
They'll be talking
about it for days to come.

41
00:03:28,454 --> 00:03:30,855
<i>I thought you were
a realist.</i>

42
00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:33,524
Didn't realize
you'd die for pride.

43
00:03:33,559 --> 00:03:36,294
Don't give up on me
just yet.

44
00:03:36,328 --> 00:03:38,863
I survived one
trial by combat,

45
00:03:38,897 --> 00:03:40,965
even though you weren't
there to save me.

46
00:03:40,999 --> 00:03:43,468
I can't save you
this time either.

47
00:03:44,803 --> 00:03:47,171
<i>My training has proved</i>

48
00:03:47,206 --> 00:03:50,041
that I can't beat
a stable boy with my left hand.

49
00:03:50,075 --> 00:03:53,177
Where's your sense
of adventure?

50
00:03:54,413 --> 00:03:56,447
Even if you lose,
imagine the look

51
00:03:56,482 --> 00:03:57,715
on Father's face
when you fall.

- Our family name snuffed out

53
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:02,854
with a single swing
of the sword.

54
00:04:02,888 --> 00:04:04,489
It is tempting.

Well...

57
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:25,143
Bronn fought for me once,
he'll do it again.

58
00:04:26,512 --> 00:04:28,646
If he wins,

59
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,681
I expect I'll be
in his debt

Will you find him for me?

63
00:04:38,557 --> 00:04:41,659
Who does Cersei plan
on naming as a champion?

64
00:04:41,693 --> 00:04:44,428
I hope it's Ser Meryn Trant.

65
00:04:44,463 --> 00:04:47,932
I'd enjoy watching Bronn
disembowel that pompous child beater.

66

No.

67

89
00:06:48,553 --> 00:06:51,355
Tried to walk back
to my hut,

00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,858
hurt too much.

Then I remembered
they burned my hut down.

So why go on?

I'm to wed

Lollys Stokeworth?

<i>She doesn't strike me
as your sort of girl.</i>

227

I wouldn't say I had
a single sort of girl.

She's dim-witted.

229

If I wanted wits,
I'd marry you.

230

When my sister arranged
this love match,

231
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:48,265
did she mention that Lollys
has an older sister?

233
00:14:49,734 --> 00:14:52,102

And you understand

Falyse is 40

Unless she happens
to perish before her father.

239
00:15:02,514 --> 00:15:04,381
Then Lollys gets the castle.

240

from their horses

242
00:15:10,622 --> 00:15:13,056

<i>Why did you bother
to come here?</i>

244

me to sell you out,

245
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,237
you'd double their price.

Is it two wives you want
or two castles?

247
00:15:29,641 --> 00:15:31,341
One of each will do.

248
00:15:31,376 --> 00:15:34,912
But if you want me
to kill the Mountain for you,

249
00:15:34,946 --> 00:15:36,713
it'd better be
a damn big castle.

252
00:15:40,985 --> 00:15:42,653
I have gold.

253

Your sister's

you so much?

I cannot pursue my talents.

315
00:19:12,897 --> 00:19:15,532
I've ordered the Second Sons
to patrol the streets

316
00:19:15,566 --> 00:19:17,300
to stop
the revenge killing.

317
00:19:17,335 --> 00:19:18,602
You've ordered us
to be night watchmen.

318
00:19:18,636 --> 00:19:20,570
And as for women,

319
00:19:20,605 --> 00:19:24,341
there are thousands
in Meereen you can pursue.

320
00:19:25,343 --> 00:19:27,144
There is only one,

321
00:19:27,178 --> 00:19:29,813
and she does not
want me.

322
00:19:31,349 --> 00:19:32,649
You swore me your sword.

323
00:19:32,683 --> 00:19:35,252
My sword is yours
till the day I die.

324
00:19:35,286 --> 00:19:37,454
So if I command you
to stay in Meereen

325
00:19:37,488 --> 00:19:38,922
and patrol the streets?

326
00:19:38,956 --> 00:19:41,658
I'll stay in Meereen
and patrol the streets.

327
00:19:41,692 --> 00:19:44,161
Send me to kill
your enemies.

328
00:19:44,195 --> 00:19:46,496
Any enemy anywhere.

329
00:19:47,565 --> 00:19:50,067
Let me do
what I do best.

330
00:19:51,469 --> 00:19:53,270
Very well.

331
00:19:59,277 --> 00:20:01,311
Do what you do best.

332
00:20:12,156 --> 00:20:14,357
Take off your clothes.

Oh.

335
00:20:46,324 --> 00:20:48,358
Come in, my queen.
Please.

336
00:20:48,392 --> 00:20:50,327
I didn't mean
to disturb you, my lady.

337
00:20:50,361 --> 00:20:51,862
You could never
disturb me.

338
00:20:51,896 --> 00:20:54,264
I just wanted to speak
with you before we left.

339
00:20:54,298 --> 00:20:57,134
Could you bring me
that vial over there?

340
00:21:00,004 --> 00:21:01,605
The blue one.

341
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:06,143
<i>No, no, no.
Not that one.</i>

342
00:21:06,177 --> 00:21:08,378
You don't even want
to touch that one.

343
00:21:08,412 --> 00:21:10,580
<i>Next to it.</i>

344
00:21:10,615 --> 00:21:12,616
<i>That's the one.</i>

346
00:21:31,269 --> 00:21:33,303
When I looked into
the flames this morning,

347
00:21:33,337 --> 00:21:35,572
the Lord spoke to me.

348
00:21:35,606 --> 00:21:37,474
He said,

349
00:21:37,508 --> 00:21:41,978
"Tonight, you will have your
last good bath in a long while.

350
00:21:42,013 --> 00:21:44,247
Make it count."

351
00:21:47,518 --> 00:21:48,852
A joke.

352
00:21:50,788 --> 00:21:52,656
Not a very good one,
I'm afraid.

353
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:54,524
It was. I...

354
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,160
humor isn't my strength.

355
00:21:57,195 --> 00:21:58,828
That's because
st jokes are lies

356
00:21:58,863 --> 00:22:01,565
and you're devoted
to the truth.

357
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:04,834
If they're lies, my lady,
aren't they best avoided?

358
00:22:04,869 --> 00:22:07,337
Not always.

359
00:22:16,714 --> 00:22:18,915
Most of these powders
and potions

360
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:20,550
are lies.

361
00:22:20,585 --> 00:22:25,121
<i>Deceptions to make men
think they witnessed our Lord's power.</i>

362
00:22:25,156 --> 00:22:28,625
Once they step into his light,
they will see the lie for what it was...

363
00:22:28,659 --> 00:22:31,962
a trick that led them
to the truth.

364
00:22:31,996 --> 00:22:34,764
<i>A pinch of this powder
in a bonfire</i>

365
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:38,034
will send a flaming column
screaming towards the sky.

366
00:22:38,069 --> 00:22:40,837
And this one creates
a black smoke

367
00:22:40,871 --> 00:22:43,306
that will make the bravest
man piss himself with fear.

368
00:22:43,341 --> 00:22:46,776
And a drop of this
in any man's wine

369
00:22:46,811 --> 00:22:49,112
will drive him
wild with lust.

370
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:54,551
Did you use it
with Stannis?

371
00:22:54,585 --> 00:22:55,952
No.

372
00:22:58,656 --> 00:23:00,223
Don't be upset.

373
00:23:00,258 --> 00:23:03,460
Men never crave
what they already have.

374
00:23:05,296 --> 00:23:07,230
It's only flesh.

375
00:23:07,265 --> 00:23:09,899
It needs
what it needs.

376
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:16,106
No act done in service
of the Lord

377
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,942
can ever be called a sin.

378
00:23:18,976 --> 00:23:22,412
I thank God every day
for bringing you to us.

379
00:23:22,446 --> 00:23:25,015
And Stannis to you.

380
00:23:25,049 --> 00:23:29,552
He wants to bring
Shireen with us.

381
00:23:30,821 --> 00:23:34,024
I think that would be
ill-advised.

382
00:23:34,058 --> 00:23:37,694
<i>My daughter has heretical tendencies,
as you're well aware.</i>

383
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:41,531
I don't know if her doubt is real
or simply meant to spite me,

384
00:23:41,565 --> 00:23:44,968
but whichever the case,
she should stay home.

385
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,274
I understand
how you feel.

386
00:23:51,309 --> 00:23:52,676
Hmm.

387
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:54,911
But that
is impossible.

388
00:23:57,715 --> 00:23:59,749
Why?

389
00:23:59,784 --> 00:24:03,620
You don't need powders
and potions, my queen.

390
00:24:03,654 --> 00:24:05,789
You don't need lies.

391
00:24:05,823 --> 00:24:09,292
You are strong enough to look into
the Lord's light

392
00:24:09,327 --> 00:24:11,661
and see his truth
for yourself.

393
00:24:17,401 --> 00:24:19,602
However harsh it is.

394
00:24:19,637 --> 00:24:22,138
However hard for us
to understand.

395
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,208
<i>You don't need my help,</i>

396
00:24:25,242 --> 00:24:28,044
<i>but I will need yours soon.</i>

397
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:31,114
When we set sail,
your daughter must be with us.

398
00:24:34,652 --> 00:24:36,820
The Lord needs her.

399
00:24:44,128 --> 00:24:46,529
Jorah the Andal.

400
00:24:47,665 --> 00:24:49,866
Are you here
to see our queen?

401
00:24:51,602 --> 00:24:53,703
She's in a good mood.

402
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:10,653
Khaleesi.

403
00:25:10,688 --> 00:25:13,089
- You're here early.
- Later than some.

404
00:25:15,393 --> 00:25:16,860
You don't approve?

405
00:25:16,894 --> 00:25:19,295
It's not a question of approval,
it's a question of trust.

406
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:21,664
You neither
approve nor trust.

407
00:25:21,699 --> 00:25:23,299
Why would I?
The man's a sellsword.

408
00:25:23,334 --> 00:25:24,868
Didn't you fight for
the Golden Company

409
00:25:24,902 --> 00:25:26,436
before pledging
your sword to my brother?

410
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:28,138
I did.

411
00:25:28,172 --> 00:25:29,606
I trust you.

412
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,108
Daario Naharis
killed his captains

413
00:25:32,143 --> 00:25:35,311
and dumped their heads at your feet
when he grew tired of their commands.

414
00:25:35,346 --> 00:25:37,847
How could you ever have
faith in a man like that?

415
00:25:37,882 --> 00:25:41,251
I could never have faith
in a man like Daario.

416
00:25:42,787 --> 00:25:45,422
That's why I've sent him and
the Second Sons to retake Yunkai.

417
00:25:47,558 --> 00:25:49,659
- You have?
- I have.

418
00:25:49,693 --> 00:25:51,761
Without you there
to rule, Khaleesi,

419
00:25:51,796 --> 00:25:54,063
I fear the masters
will simply bide their time,

420
00:25:54,098 --> 00:25:56,332
wait for the invaders
to leave and reassert control.

421
00:25:56,367 --> 00:26:00,503
That is why I've ordered Daario
to execute every master in Yunkai.

422
00:26:01,939 --> 00:26:04,507
The masters tear babies
from their mothers' arms.

423
00:26:04,542 --> 00:26:07,010
They mutilate little boys
by the thousands.

424
00:26:07,044 --> 00:26:09,446
They train little girls
in the art of pleasuring old men.

425
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,582
They treat men like beasts,
as you said yourself.

426
00:26:12,616 --> 00:26:16,152
Herding the masters into pens
and slaughtering them by the thousands

427
00:26:16,187 --> 00:26:18,188
is also treating men
like beasts.

428
00:26:18,222 --> 00:26:20,390
The slaves you freed,

429
00:26:20,424 --> 00:26:22,525
brutality is all
they've ever known.

430
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,661
If you want them to know
something else,

431
00:26:24,695 --> 00:26:26,062
you'll have
to show it to them.

432
00:26:26,096 --> 00:26:28,164
And repay the slavers
with what? Kindness?

433
00:26:28,199 --> 00:26:29,699
A fine?
A stern warning?

434
00:26:29,733 --> 00:26:32,869
It's tempting to see
your enemies as evil, all of them,

435
00:26:32,903 --> 00:26:35,638
but there's good and evil
on both sides in every war ever fought.

436
00:26:35,673 --> 00:26:38,141
Let the priests argue
over good and evil.

437
00:26:38,175 --> 00:26:39,709
Slavery is real.

438
00:26:39,743 --> 00:26:41,978
I can end it.
I will end it.

439
00:26:42,012 --> 00:26:44,314
<i>And I will end
those behind it.</i>

440
00:26:44,348 --> 00:26:46,549
I sold men
into slavery, Khaleesi.

441
00:26:46,584 --> 00:26:51,421
And now you are helping me
show them to freedom.

442
00:26:51,455 --> 00:26:54,824
I wouldn't be here to help you
if Ned Stark had done to me

443
00:26:54,859 --> 00:26:57,694
what you want to do
to the masters of Yunkai.

444
00:27:02,233 --> 00:27:05,134
The man who came to me
the other day about burying his father.

445
00:27:05,169 --> 00:27:07,237
Hizdahr zo Loraq?

446
00:27:07,271 --> 00:27:09,973
He will accompany
the Second Sons

447
00:27:10,007 --> 00:27:11,941
and serve as my ambassador
to Yunkai.

448
00:27:11,976 --> 00:27:14,944
He will tell the masters
what has happened in Meereen.

449
00:27:14,979 --> 00:27:18,548
He will explain the choice
they have before them.

450
00:27:18,582 --> 00:27:20,517
They can live
in my new world

451
00:27:20,551 --> 00:27:23,586
or they can die
in their old one.

452
00:27:27,725 --> 00:27:30,193
Well, go and catch Daario
before he leaves.

453
00:27:30,227 --> 00:27:32,095
Tell him
I changed my mind.

454
00:27:32,129 --> 00:27:34,497
Yes, Khaleesi.

455
00:27:39,737 --> 00:27:41,471
No.

456
00:27:44,341 --> 00:27:47,043
Tell him <i>you</i>
changed my mind.

457
00:27:57,788 --> 00:28:00,690
<font color="#808080">(HOUND GRUNTS)</font>
Rat cunts.

458
00:28:02,126 --> 00:28:04,427
Fucking whore.

459
00:28:06,297 --> 00:28:07,964
<i>You're doing it wrong.</i>

460
00:28:07,998 --> 00:28:10,934
You need to burn away
that horrible bit there.

461
00:28:10,968 --> 00:28:13,703
<i>Otherwise it's gonna
get infected and fester.</i>

462
00:28:16,173 --> 00:28:19,142
I know you don't like fire,
but if you don't do it right...

463
00:28:19,176 --> 00:28:21,110
No fire.

464
00:28:22,212 --> 00:28:24,414
It'll only take a second.

465
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:26,849
- It won't hurt that much.
- No fire!

466
00:28:41,532 --> 00:28:43,533
Shut up about it.

467
00:28:46,236 --> 00:28:48,271
Shut up about everything.

468
00:28:48,305 --> 00:28:50,974
Thanks to you,
I'm a walking bag of silver

469
00:28:51,008 --> 00:28:53,276
anywhere the Lannisters
hold sway.

470
00:28:54,979 --> 00:28:56,813
Which is everywhere
between where we are now

471
00:28:56,847 --> 00:28:58,848
and where we're going.

472
00:29:01,385 --> 00:29:04,520
I'm as stupid as that hog
you stuck back in the village,

473
00:29:04,555 --> 00:29:08,725
getting myself cut
and stabbed and bitten.

474
00:29:11,261 --> 00:29:13,630
No reward is worth
this much trouble.

475
00:29:13,664 --> 00:29:16,599
<i>Wish I'd never
laid eyes on you.</i>

476
00:29:26,844 --> 00:29:29,846
You say your brother
gave you that sword.

477
00:29:32,216 --> 00:29:34,283
My brother gave me this.

478
00:29:36,286 --> 00:29:38,521
It was just like you said
a while back.

479
00:29:38,555 --> 00:29:40,356
<i>Pressed me to the fire</i>

480
00:29:40,391 --> 00:29:43,292
like I was a nice
juicy mutton chop.

481
00:29:46,363 --> 00:29:48,064
Why?

482
00:29:48,098 --> 00:29:49,966
Thought I stole
one of his toys.

483
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,568
I didn't steal it.
I was just playing with it.

484
00:29:57,474 --> 00:29:59,442
The pain was bad.

485
00:29:59,476 --> 00:30:01,511
The smell was worse.

486
00:30:04,581 --> 00:30:08,851
But the worst thing
was that it was my brother who did it.

487
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:15,925
My father,
who protected him...

488
00:30:17,895 --> 00:30:20,596
told everyone my bedding
caught fire.

489
00:30:33,277 --> 00:30:35,712
You think
you're on your own?

490
00:30:38,615 --> 00:30:40,316
Let me wash it out

491
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:42,585
and help you
sew it up at least.

492
00:31:09,213 --> 00:31:11,481
<font color="#804040">BRIENNE</font>: Bit of comfort
never hurt anyone.

493
00:31:11,515 --> 00:31:13,716
We've been sleeping in
ditches the last few weeks.

494
00:31:13,751 --> 00:31:16,586
I think we can treat
ourselves to a featherbed for the night

495
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:19,489
and a hot meal
not cooked by you.

496
00:31:19,556 --> 00:31:20,990
Couldn't agree
more, my lady.

497
00:31:21,024 --> 00:31:22,925
Just don't start expecting
silk underclothes.

498
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,194
Not working for your
former lord any longer.

499
00:31:25,229 --> 00:31:27,530
- Yes, my lady.
- Don't get drunk.

500
00:31:29,233 --> 00:31:30,333
No, my lady.

501
00:31:30,367 --> 00:31:31,834
<font color="#804040">HOT PIE</font>: <i>Can I get you
anything else?</i>

502
00:31:31,869 --> 00:31:33,636
No, this will do
nicely, thank you.

503
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:35,204
Kidney pie is wonderful.

504
00:31:35,239 --> 00:31:37,173
Thanks.

505
00:31:37,207 --> 00:31:39,408
I do my best.

506
00:31:41,044 --> 00:31:43,613
A good kidney pie is all
about the ingredients.

507
00:31:43,647 --> 00:31:46,616
<i>Flour, lard, water,
eggs, milk.</i>

508
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:48,451
Easy enough.
But the meat,

509
00:31:48,485 --> 00:31:51,454
peacetime or not, getting your hands on
a good bottom round steak

510
00:31:51,488 --> 00:31:53,156
and calves' kidneys
is not easy.

511
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:55,758
I mean, some people settle
for plain old beef kidneys.

512
00:31:55,793 --> 00:31:58,060
Got no right to cook
anything, them.

513
00:31:58,095 --> 00:31:59,662
Oh, and the gravy.

514
00:31:59,696 --> 00:32:01,531
Don't get me started
on the gravy.

515
00:32:01,565 --> 00:32:02,932
<i>Very difficult
to get right.</i>

516
00:32:02,966 --> 00:32:04,767
<i>See, a lot of people
give up on the gravy.</i>

517
00:32:04,802 --> 00:32:07,003
You cannot give up
on the gravy.

518
00:32:07,037 --> 00:32:08,604
No gravy, no pie.

519
00:32:08,639 --> 00:32:11,040
Simple as that.

520
00:32:11,074 --> 00:32:14,410
That's nice armor.
Are you a knight?

521
00:32:16,513 --> 00:32:17,980
No.

522
00:32:18,015 --> 00:32:21,150
Oh, it's just people with
armor are usually knights.

523
00:32:21,185 --> 00:32:23,853
<i>Generally speaking.
From King's Landing, though, aren't you?</i>

524
00:32:23,887 --> 00:32:26,722
<i>From there myself originally.
Flea Bottom born and bred.</i>

525
00:32:26,757 --> 00:32:28,558
<i>What brings you
to these parts?</i>

526
00:32:28,592 --> 00:32:30,593
We're looking
for someone.

527
00:32:30,627 --> 00:32:33,062
Someone in particular?
Maybe they came in here.

528
00:32:33,096 --> 00:32:35,456
A lot of people come in here.
Just the other day we had 17...

529
00:32:35,465 --> 00:32:37,400
A girl, tall, red hair,
very pretty.

530
00:32:37,434 --> 00:32:40,937
Her name is Sansa Stark,
but she may be using a different name.

531
00:32:40,971 --> 00:32:42,905
Starks?

532
00:32:46,043 --> 00:32:48,911
What, like them lot
from "Winterhell"?

533
00:32:52,349 --> 00:32:54,483
No, ain't seen
anyone like that.

534
00:32:54,518 --> 00:32:56,252
I heard they was
all traitors.

535
00:32:56,286 --> 00:32:58,588
Don't need
no traitors in here.

536
00:32:58,622 --> 00:33:01,958
<i>I pledged my life to
their mother Catelyn Stark.</i>

537
00:33:01,992 --> 00:33:04,193
I swore to her I'd bring
her daughters home.

538
00:33:08,632 --> 00:33:11,167
Sure I can't get you
a bit more kidney pie?

539
00:33:25,315 --> 00:33:26,449
What?

540
00:33:26,483 --> 00:33:28,084
It's nothing, my lady.

541
00:33:28,118 --> 00:33:31,454
You wouldn't be screwing
your face up like that if it was nothing.

542
00:33:31,488 --> 00:33:33,956
Don't want to offend, my lady.
Truly, I don't.

543
00:33:33,991 --> 00:33:35,792
You're not interesting
enough to be offensive.

544
00:33:37,594 --> 00:33:39,896
The Lannisters
want Lady Sansa.

545
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:42,598
The Lannisters
have money.

546
00:33:42,633 --> 00:33:44,433
People kill for money.

547
00:33:45,669 --> 00:33:47,536
I don't think we should
be telling people

548
00:33:47,571 --> 00:33:49,138
we're searching
for Lady Sansa.

549
00:33:58,916 --> 00:34:01,851
My lady. My lord.
Could I have a word?

550
00:34:01,885 --> 00:34:03,819
What about?
Not kidney pie.

551
00:34:03,854 --> 00:34:05,421
<i>You seem
like a proper lady.</i>

552
00:34:05,455 --> 00:34:07,890
<i>Someone who could
be trusted.</i>

553
00:34:09,893 --> 00:34:12,028
I never met no Sansa Stark.

554
00:34:12,062 --> 00:34:14,130
But I know her sister...

555
00:34:14,164 --> 00:34:15,998
Arya.

556
00:34:18,135 --> 00:34:21,771
No one's seen Arya Stark
since her father was beheaded.

557
00:34:21,805 --> 00:34:24,607
She's presumed dead.

558
00:34:24,641 --> 00:34:26,575
She weren't when I last
spoke to her.

559
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:27,433
When was that?

560
00:34:27,458 --> 00:34:29,011
<i>Heading up north with
the Night's Watch.</i>

561
00:34:29,012 --> 00:34:30,513
She was all dressed up
as a boy.

562
00:34:30,547 --> 00:34:33,382
Like your ladyship,
only without the armor.

563
00:34:33,417 --> 00:34:35,251
<i>Going by the name Arry.</i>

564
00:34:35,285 --> 00:34:37,053
- So what happened to her?
- Well...

565
00:34:37,087 --> 00:34:39,255
The quick version.

566
00:34:39,289 --> 00:34:41,123
The Lannisters
took us prisoner.

567
00:34:41,158 --> 00:34:42,992
We escaped.

568
00:34:43,026 --> 00:34:45,227
The Brotherhood took
us prisoner.

569
00:34:45,262 --> 00:34:46,729
They sold me
to the innkeep.

570
00:34:46,763 --> 00:34:49,332
<i>They were gonna sell Arya
to her mother at Riverrun</i>

571
00:34:49,366 --> 00:34:50,666
<i>along with another prisoner.</i>

572
00:34:50,701 --> 00:34:52,601
Big ugly fellow.
Foul mouth

573
00:34:52,636 --> 00:34:54,637
and a face like
a half-burnt ham.

574
00:34:54,671 --> 00:34:56,605
- <i>Not friendly.</i>
- The Hound.

575
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,407
That's the one.

576
00:34:58,442 --> 00:35:01,744
If you find her,
could you give her this?

577
00:35:01,778 --> 00:35:03,579
She liked the last one
I gave her,

578
00:35:03,613 --> 00:35:05,948
but, well, this one
turned out better.

579
00:35:15,525 --> 00:35:18,260
Um, you were saying?

the new lord of Riverrun.

582
00:35:27,437 --> 00:35:29,305
The Brotherhood
isn't going to Riverrun.

583
00:35:29,339 --> 00:35:31,273
They'll take her
to the Eyrie, my lady.

584
00:35:31,308 --> 00:35:33,109
Why the Eyrie?

585
00:35:33,143 --> 00:35:35,611
Her aunt, Lysa Arryn.

586
00:35:35,645 --> 00:35:37,713
Catelyn Stark's sister.

587
00:35:37,748 --> 00:35:40,783
She's Arya's last living
relative with money.

588
00:35:40,817 --> 00:35:43,552
She hates the Lannisters.

589
00:35:45,655 --> 00:35:47,857
Lord Tyrion
made sure I knew

590
00:35:47,891 --> 00:35:50,993
which house married which
and who hated who.

591
00:35:51,028 --> 00:35:52,728
Sansa could
be there, too.

592
00:35:52,763 --> 00:35:55,231
Aye, my lady.

593
00:35:55,265 --> 00:35:56,966
Could be.

594
00:36:03,373 --> 00:36:05,274
You sure about this?

595
00:36:08,578 --> 00:36:10,179
No.

I imagined you'd be back
at the brothel at this hour.

598
00:36:44,147 --> 00:36:47,414
I did spend some time
with an absolutely stunning

599
00:36:47,439 --> 00:36:48,918
blonde the other day.

600
00:36:48,919 --> 00:36:51,720
Mm, do tell.

601
00:36:51,755 --> 00:36:55,157
I've got every kind
of filth down here

602
00:36:55,192 --> 00:36:56,725
except the kind I like.

603
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,761
Your sister.

604
00:36:58,795 --> 00:37:00,996
Oh.

605
00:37:06,837 --> 00:37:09,605
Cersei approached me.

606
00:37:10,907 --> 00:37:12,942
<i>We spoke a great deal
about her daughter.</i>

607
00:37:12,976 --> 00:37:16,078
How worried your sister
is about her.

608
00:37:16,113 --> 00:37:19,014
<i>She was trying
very hard to pretend</i>

609
00:37:19,049 --> 00:37:21,050
<i>she had not come
to sway me against you.</i>

610
00:37:21,084 --> 00:37:23,385
<i>I think she may have even
believed it herself.</i>

611
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:26,455
Making honest feelings
do dishonest work

612
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:28,924
is one of her many gifts.

613
00:37:28,959 --> 00:37:31,961
It was difficult for her
to hide her true intentions.

614
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:36,765
It is rare
to meet a Lannister

615
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,803
who shares my enthusiasm
for dead Lannisters.

616
00:37:43,273 --> 00:37:45,374
She desperately wants
to see you killed.

617
00:37:45,408 --> 00:37:47,610
She didn't need
to bother you.

618
00:37:47,644 --> 00:37:51,447
It looks as though
I've taken care of that myself.

619
00:37:51,481 --> 00:37:54,049
<i>The joy she will feel</i>

<i>when my head

621

She's wanted this
for a long time.

622
00:37:59,956 --> 00:38:02,758
Yes, I know.

623
00:38:02,792 --> 00:38:05,794
<i>We met, you and I.</i>

00:38:05,829 --> 00:38:07,429
Many years ago.

625
00:38:07,464 --> 00:38:10,399
I think I would
have remembered that.

626
00:38:10,433 --> 00:38:13,769
Unlikely.
You had just been born.

627
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:18,707
Our father brought me
and my sister Elia with him

628
00:38:18,742 --> 00:38:20,442
on a visit
to Casterly Rock.

629
00:38:20,477 --> 00:38:22,444
<i>My first time
away from Dorne.</i>

630
00:38:22,479 --> 00:38:24,847
I didn't like anything
about the Rock.

631
00:38:26,383 --> 00:38:28,817
Not the food,
not the weather,

632
00:38:28,852 --> 00:38:30,519
not your accents.

633
00:38:30,554 --> 00:38:32,188
Nothing.

634
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:36,125
But the biggest
disappointment...

635
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:38,460
you.

636
00:38:40,297 --> 00:38:43,265
You and my family have more
in common than you might admit.

637
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,501
<i>The whole way from Dorne</i>

638
00:38:45,535 --> 00:38:48,370
all anyone talked about
was the monster

639
00:38:48,405 --> 00:38:51,373
that had been born
to Tywin Lannister.

640
00:38:51,408 --> 00:38:54,276
<i>A head twice
the size of his body,</i>

641
00:38:54,311 --> 00:38:56,212
<i>a tail between his legs,</i>

642
00:38:56,246 --> 00:38:58,347
claws, one red eye,

643
00:38:58,381 --> 00:39:01,283
the privates of both
a girl and a boy.

644
00:39:01,318 --> 00:39:03,252
That would have made
things so much easier.

645
00:39:03,286 --> 00:39:07,156
<i>When we met your sister, she promised
she would show you to us.</i>

646
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:08,824
Every day we would ask.

647
00:39:08,858 --> 00:39:11,293
Every day she would
say, "Soon."

648
00:39:11,328 --> 00:39:14,630
Then she and your brother

649
00:39:14,664 --> 00:39:18,033
took us
to your nursery and...

650
00:39:19,469 --> 00:39:22,404
she unveiled the freak.

651
00:39:24,608 --> 00:39:26,442
<i>Your head
was a bit large.</i>

652
00:39:26,476 --> 00:39:28,377
<i>Your arms and legs
were a bit small,</i>

653
00:39:28,411 --> 00:39:30,079
but no claw.

654
00:39:30,113 --> 00:39:33,415
No red eye.
No tail between your legs.

655
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:35,784
Just a tiny pink cock.

656
00:39:35,819 --> 00:39:38,587
<i>We didn't try to hide
our disappointment.</i>

657
00:39:38,655 --> 00:39:41,056
<i>"That's not a monster,"
I told Cersei.</i>

658
00:39:41,091 --> 00:39:44,093
"That's just a baby."

659
00:39:45,595 --> 00:39:48,230
<i>And she said,
"He killed my mother."</i>

660
00:39:48,265 --> 00:39:50,766
<i>And she pinched
your little cock so hard,</i>

661
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,801
<i>I thought she might
pull it off.</i>

662
00:39:52,836 --> 00:39:54,937
<i>Until your brother
made her stop.</i>

663
00:39:54,971 --> 00:39:57,039
<i>"It doesn't matter,"
she told us.</i>

664
00:39:57,073 --> 00:40:00,042
<i>"Everyone says
he will die soon.</i>

665
00:40:00,076 --> 00:40:01,710
<i>I hope they are right.</i>

666
00:40:01,745 --> 00:40:04,413
<i>He should not
have lived this long."</i>

667
00:40:07,951 --> 00:40:09,618
Well...

668
00:40:12,222 --> 00:40:16,892
sooner or later, Cersei always gets
what she wants.

669
00:40:18,962 --> 00:40:21,930
And what about
what I want?

670
00:40:24,267 --> 00:40:26,502
Justice

671
00:40:26,536 --> 00:40:30,139
for my sister
and her children.

672
00:40:30,173 --> 00:40:32,174
If you want justice,

673
00:40:32,208 --> 00:40:35,110
you've come
to the wrong place.

674
00:40:35,145 --> 00:40:37,379
I disagree.

675
00:40:44,888 --> 00:40:47,923
I've come to
the perfect place.

676
00:40:49,659 --> 00:40:51,994
I want to bring those
who have wronged me to justice.

677
00:40:52,028 --> 00:40:55,130
And all those who have
wronged me are right here.

678
00:40:57,467 --> 00:40:59,668
I will begin with
Ser Gregor Clegane,

679
00:40:59,703 --> 00:41:02,471
<i>who killed
my sister's children</i>

680
00:41:02,505 --> 00:41:05,874
and then raped her
with their blood still on his hands

681
00:41:05,909 --> 00:41:08,644
before killing her, too.

682
00:41:17,153 --> 00:41:19,421
I will be your champion.

683
00:41:20,423 --> 00:41:23,192
<font color="#808080">(EXHALES)</font>

684
00:42:13,576 --> 00:42:15,477
Hello, Robin.

685
00:42:18,047 --> 00:42:19,381
What are you doing?

686
00:42:19,416 --> 00:42:21,350
I'm building my home,
Winterfell.

687
00:42:21,384 --> 00:42:23,419
At least I think I am.

688
00:42:23,453 --> 00:42:26,121
I haven't been back there
in a very long time.

689
00:42:26,156 --> 00:42:28,524
Why did you leave?

690
00:42:28,558 --> 00:42:30,926
It's a long story.

691
00:42:32,595 --> 00:42:34,163
I stay here in the Eyrie.

692
00:42:34,197 --> 00:42:36,965
Mother says it's dangerous on the roads
and I have to keep myself safe

693
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,634
because I'm the Lord
of the Vale

694
00:42:38,668 --> 00:42:40,969
and the Lord of the Vale
is a very important person.

695
00:42:41,004 --> 00:42:43,305
Yes, you certainly are.

696
00:42:43,339 --> 00:42:45,574
When will you go back?

697
00:42:45,608 --> 00:42:48,310
Probably never.

698
00:42:48,344 --> 00:42:50,446
My family doesn't
live there anymore

699
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,948
and someone
burned it down.

700
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:55,818
Oh.

701
00:42:55,852 --> 00:42:58,620
Does Winterfell
have a Moon Door?

702
00:42:58,655 --> 00:43:00,422
No, I'm afraid not.

703
00:43:00,457 --> 00:43:02,591
It's not high up in the mountains.
It's down on the ground.

704
00:43:02,625 --> 00:43:04,460
- That sounds dangerous.
- <font color="#808080">(CHUCKLES)</font>

705
00:43:04,494 --> 00:43:07,296
- How do you make people fly?
- We don't.

706
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:08,730
What do you do with
all the bad people

707
00:43:08,765 --> 00:43:11,233
and the scary people
and the people you don't like?

708
00:43:11,267 --> 00:43:12,801
I never did anything
with them at all.

709
00:43:12,836 --> 00:43:15,471
Girls didn't take part
in that where I came from.

710
00:43:15,505 --> 00:43:18,807
Well, I'm Lord
of the Vale.

711
00:43:18,842 --> 00:43:22,144
When I grow up, I'll be able to fly
anybody who bothers me.

712
00:43:22,178 --> 00:43:24,513
Or you.
When we get married,

713
00:43:24,547 --> 00:43:26,315
you can tell me
if you don't like somebody

714
00:43:26,349 --> 00:43:28,617
and then we can bring them
back here and, whoosh!

715
00:43:28,651 --> 00:43:30,486
Right through
the Moon Door.

716
00:43:32,188 --> 00:43:34,122
I like the sound of that.

717
00:43:34,157 --> 00:43:35,891
Let's put a Moon Door
in your Winterfell.

718
00:43:35,925 --> 00:43:37,359
All right.

719
00:43:37,393 --> 00:43:39,361
It can go in here
in this big tower.

720
00:43:39,395 --> 00:43:41,463
Careful.
You've ruined it.

721
00:43:41,498 --> 00:43:42,931
Now I'm going to have
to rebuild the whole thing.

722
00:43:42,966 --> 00:43:44,500
- I didn't ruin it.
- You did.

723
00:43:44,534 --> 00:43:46,502
It was already ruined
because it didn't have a Moon Door.

724
00:43:46,536 --> 00:43:47,870
I was fixing it.

725
00:43:47,904 --> 00:43:49,238
Knocking things down
isn't fixing them.

726
00:43:49,272 --> 00:43:51,039
- It's ruining them.
- I didn't ruin it!

727
00:43:51,074 --> 00:43:53,542
- You're being stupid.
- I didn't ruin it!

No, his mother

a long time ago.

If he tells Aunt Lysa...

Let me worry about
Aunt Lysa.

739
00:44:32,482 --> 00:44:35,217
I was trying to remember
what everything looked like.

740
00:44:36,486 --> 00:44:38,520
I'll never see it again.

741
00:44:40,256 --> 00:44:43,325
A lot can happen
between now and never.

742
00:44:45,461 --> 00:44:47,629
If you want to build
a better home,

743
00:44:47,664 --> 00:44:50,499
first you must
demolish the old one.

744
00:44:52,468 --> 00:44:55,537
Why did you really
kill Joffrey?

745
00:44:59,642 --> 00:45:01,743
Tell me why.

746
00:45:06,015 --> 00:45:09,585
I loved your mother more
than you could ever know.

747
00:45:12,221 --> 00:45:14,923
Given the opportunity,
what do we do to those

748
00:45:14,991 --> 00:45:16,992
who've hurt
the ones we love?

749

In a better world,

750
00:45:26,769 --> 00:45:29,137
one where love

751
00:45:29,172 --> 00:45:33,108
could overcome
strength and duty,

752
00:45:33,142 --> 00:45:36,878
you might have been
my child.

753
00:45:39,882 --> 00:45:42,417
But we don't live
in that world.

It's fascinating

what happens to bodies when they
hit the rocks from such a height.

766
00:47:05,268 --> 00:47:07,302
The impact breaks them
right apart.

Like eggs dropped

Sometimes pieces

Every hair in place.

and now they're all dead.

783
00:47:58,755 --> 00:48:02,824
That's what happens to people
who stand between Petyr and me.

784
00:48:02,859 --> 00:48:04,526
Look down!

785
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,962
Look down!
Look down! Look down!

787
00:48:09,899 --> 00:48:12,534
Let her go.

788
00:48:15,438 --> 00:48:17,572
You want her?

789
00:48:17,607 --> 00:48:21,243
This empty-headed child?

790
00:48:21,277 --> 00:48:22,778
Let her go.

791
00:48:22,812 --> 00:48:25,614
She's just like her mother.
She'll never love you.

792
00:48:25,648 --> 00:48:28,183
I lied for you.

793
00:48:28,217 --> 00:48:30,218
<i>I killed for you.</i>

794
00:48:30,253 --> 00:48:32,587
Why did you bring
her here? Why?

795
00:48:32,622 --> 00:48:34,556
I'll send her away.

796
00:48:35,858 --> 00:48:38,426
I swear on my life.

797
00:48:39,395 --> 00:48:41,930
I swear to all the gods.

798
00:48:43,299 --> 00:48:44,833
Let her go, Lysa.
