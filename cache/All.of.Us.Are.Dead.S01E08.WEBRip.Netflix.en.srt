1
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,962
The ones who get bullied
have a problem too.

2
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,715
The kids must have
a reason for bullying you.

3
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,303
Look.

4
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:56,222
It's okay.

5
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:58,349
Fuck off.

6
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:06,566
You did nothing wrong?

7
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:12,072
There's nothing you're sorry about?

8
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:16,743
The kids must have
a reason for bullying you.

9
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:21,122
PROVIDING AN EDUCATION
THAT WARMS AND STRENGTHENS LIVES

10
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:31,633
I wish the school would burn down.

11
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:34,385
So that nothing remains.

12
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,805
So that everything disappears.

13
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,197
Hey, Dae-su!

14
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,291
What about the others?
Is it really just you?

15
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,085
It's just me.

16
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,170
Downstairs? In the classrooms?

17
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,256
There's no one down there. It's just me!

18
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,311
Hold tight!

19
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,231
You're sure there's no one else, right?

20
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,567
They're all zombies.

21
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,444
They all died.

22
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:36,948
Pull it tighter, guys.

23
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,148
Give me your eye.

24
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,198
What the hell? Fuck!

25
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,951
Why didn't you die?

26
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,081
DOOR WILL OPEN AUTOMATICALLY
IN CASE OF FIRE

27
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:09,707
Guys!

28
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,417
The door's open.

29
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:17,507
-Let's go!
-One, two, three!

30
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:22,804
-Look! A chopper!
-Over here!

31
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,597
-Hey!
-Over here!

32
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:25,556
Here!

33
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,599
We're here!

34
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,268
Help!

35
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,852
Come back!

36
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,229
-Help!
-Come back!

37
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,982
-Help!
-Come back here!

38
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,704
-Over here!
-Hey!

39
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,247
-Where are you going?
-Over here!

40
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,540
-Hey!
-Come back!

41
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,542
-Over here!
-Help!

42
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,966
-Hey!
-Why are you leaving?

43
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,178
-Hey!
-We're still here!

44
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,263
Where are you going?

45
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,642
We're here…

46
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:13,980
Fuck! Damn it.

47
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:22,071
HYOSAN HIGH SCHOOL

48
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:40,757
Mom…

49
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,065
Mom…

50
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:38,439
Fuck.

51
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,240
He's gone.

52
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,450
What the hell?

53
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:53,246
-Who's gone?
-Gwi-nam.

54
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:56,999
It's his smell.

55
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,419
I hear his breathing too.

56
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,615
HYOSAN HIGH SCHOOL

57
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:04,692
What happened?
Didn't Gwi-nam fall from the fourth floor?

58
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:05,902
He did. I threw him.

59
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,737
So how did he survive?

60
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,530
Look for ones with colors.

61
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:14,118
Maybe he doesn't die.
Or maybe he dies and comes back to life.

62
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:18,122
-It has to be visible from the sky.
-He's neither human nor zombie.

63
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,543
Do you remember
that girl in the teachers' office?

64
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:23,836
I'll kill you!

65
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,339
Give it to me, fucker! I'll kill you!

66
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:31,427
-She was weird too.
-Gwi-nam's like her, isn't he?

67
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:33,638
I think so.

68
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,391
Maybe Nam-ra is the same.

69
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,852
What are you doing, Dae-su?

70
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:40,937
Look I found an "O."

71
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:44,774
That's what you found?

72
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:45,816
She'll be fine.

73
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:48,152
You can't guarantee what will happen.

74
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,031
There's nothing we can guarantee
right now.

75
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,909
We don't know if we'll live or die.

76
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:56,869
Let's go make the SOS sign.

77
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,498
Bare-su.

78
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:06,003
If On-jo were like that,
could you just dump her?

79
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:08,381
It's totally visible from up there.

80
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:17,265
It came and left, didn't it? A chopper?

81
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:18,808
Yes.

82
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:22,186
Maybe they started the rescues.
Let's get to the rooftop.

83
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,564
What if that's the end of the rescue?

84
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:25,815
But it only came once.

85
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,818
We don't know
whether or not it'll come back.

86
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,736
I don't think we should go to the roof.

87
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,406
If it comes back, will you take the blame?
What will you do then?

88
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:34,615
-Nothing.
-Hey.

89
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:38,160
We can't make it to the roof anyway.

90
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:40,871
How can we carry him up there?

91
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,291
Hey.

92
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,752
-Just leave me and go.
-For real?

93
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,380
Yes. You should just go.

94
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,049
You mean it? You know how I am, don't you?

95
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,552
I'll leave you.

96
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,512
Should we?

97
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:57,930
Should we not?

98
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,683
Don't act tough.

99
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,352
There's a ton of tough bastards outside.

100
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,605
I won't die from this, will I?

101
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,649
Fuck, I don't know.

102
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,819
Anyway, we should put up
a sign or something.

103
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:14,155
How would anyone know
we're in here and save us?

104
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:17,199
Doesn't this building have a rooftop?
There's no way up there?

105
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,744
They'll see us up there.

106
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:22,538
Well, there is a ladder
that leads to the roof, but--

107
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,415
Right? There is, right? Where is it?

108
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:25,750
-Outside.
-Outside?

109
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:26,792
Yes, outside.

110
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,297
You fucker. Come here.

111
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,257
-What? Why?
-You bastard.

112
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,009
-What? Outside?
-Sorry!

113
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:36,344
Get back here. Fuck.

114
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:37,803
Stay back!

115
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,473
-Let me throw you out for five seconds!
-Help!

116
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:41,432
This is too big.

117
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:42,558
How about this?

118
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,685
-Break it apart.
-Here's a big one.

119
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,020
How's this?

120
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:47,813
Not that one. Put it down.

121
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:48,981
Not this?

122
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,442
-Gather anything big and colorful.
-Can I take this?

123
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:53,778
Joon-yeong, go up there and look.

124
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:55,613
Hey, be careful.

125
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:58,866
How does it look?

126
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,910
-First…
-Yes.

127
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,286
The "O" is a bit narrow.

128
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,122
He said the "O" is too narrow.
Dae-su, hand me that long one.

129
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:08,084
It should be much bigger than this.

130
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,419
Nam-ra, can you carry this?

131
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:14,382
-Guys, keep it up.
-That goes over there.

132
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,341
It goes like this.

133
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,176
And the "S" is too short.

134
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,928
-Get more of these.
-Is this enough?

135
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,430
Fill that spot too. That's it.

136
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,807
I got this part.

137
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,309
They're too tight.

138
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,727
Spread them out.

139
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,104
Let's put it all away.

140
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,523
Come take a look. We did a good job.

141
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,610
-Look.
-You can't miss it.

142
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,279
-We did do a good job.
-Right?

143
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,953
It seems a little crooked.

144
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,538
And the "S" is kind of short.

145
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:46,497
Hope is…

146
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:51,794
the cruelest torture
that prevents you from giving up on life.

147
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:06,434
REALTY

148
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:18,195
WOOGYEONG GIRLS' MIDDLE SCHOOL

149
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,280
HYOSAN ARTS CENTER

150
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,243
I can't think of anything else,
but I can't stop either.

151
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,123
MYEONHAK-DONG

152
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:32,168
HYOSAN HIGH SCHOOL

153
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:47,016
Once body temperature rose,
the white blood cells were activated.

154
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:51,103
But they were absorbed by the virus
and turned into a different virus.

155
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:10,331
Gently.

156
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:16,587
You'll draw the zombies.

157
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,301
Bite down.

158
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:25,429
Good job. All done.

159
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,939
It isn't broken,

160
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,609
so it'll get better soon
if you leave it like this.

161
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,028
Thank you, detective.

162
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:45,157
No need for formalities.
Just call me Jae-ik.

163
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:46,617
Okay, Jae-ik.

164
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,662
Since we're comfortable
with each other now,

165
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,372
may I speak frankly?

166
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,082
Yes, of course. Speak freely.

167
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,250
Okay.

168
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,502
-You crazy idiot. You stupid moron.
-What…

169
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,463
You fucking came here
just to shoot some Internet show?

170
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,715
You're a total moron.

171
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,885
What? Subscribe and like?
Do you like that more than your life?

172
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,929
You're a crazy asshole.

173
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,306
I'm sorry, detective.

174
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,142
Don't call me detective.
I said to call me by my name.

175
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,269
It's fine, detective.

176
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:16,647
If you were my brother,
you wouldn't need to worry about zombies.

177
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,357
I'd beat you to death right here.

178
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:22,945
But someone must uncover the truth
and let the world know, detective.

179
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,697
What? The truth?

180
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:27,700
Hey. Are you a journalist?

181
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:28,659
Come on.

182
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,996
Journalists don't dig to find the truth.

183
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,081
That's why people like me
must step in, detective.

184
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:36,458
Seriously. You and that mouth of yours.

185
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,252
Right.

186
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:42,464
It looked like your colleague dumped you
and took off.

187
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,425
Should I blast him on my show?

188
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,385
I can even interview you if you want.

189
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,972
-Forget it.
-You should take revenge on traitors.

190
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:50,931
Look.

191
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,059
I learned from
my long experience as a detective.

192
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,853
Assholes fighting to stay alive

193
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:58,647
and coming at you
hoping to die are impossible to beat.

194
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,025
I'm just worried about the kids.

195
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:06,030
I have a pretty good number of followers.
I can end him socially for good.

196
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,281
Oysterubbish.

197
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:08,866
Orangibberish. Not Oysterubbish.

198
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:12,953
Who gives a shit? Stop gibberishing
and gather everything we can throw.

199
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:14,663
What? Why?

200
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,207
Why else? It's crazy hot up here.

201
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,043
You want to become human jerky?

202
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:21,754
Why is everyone I meet like this?

203
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:29,845
They're not moving.

204
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,932
No. They follow sounds.

205
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:34,725
Keep handing them over.

206
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:45,611
What are you doing?

207
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:48,280
You said you'd clear them out,
not lure them.

208
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:51,200
They followed sounds earlier.

209
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,535
What the hell? Give me one more.

210
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,329
Stop it. More keep coming.

211
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:56,914
I said to give it to me, asshole.

212
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:59,291
-I ought to just…
-It's weird.

213
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,926
MUNPYEONG DAYCARE

214
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,472
Oh God.

215
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:16,266
Oh my God.

216
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:19,937
Sir!

217
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,772
-You traitor!
-Traitor.

218
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:26,110
Jump! Jump on top of the bus!

219
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,569
Jump down!

220
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,988
I got it, asshole. Shut up.

221
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,364
-Let's go.
-What?

222
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,200
-I said let's go!
-But…

223
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,082
Goddamn it.

224
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,670
Fuck. That was close.

225
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,338
Hey. Jump.

226
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,507
What? I can't jump.

227
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,342
Don't give me that bullshit. Jump.

228
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,760
I hurt my leg!

229
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:52,886
I know. Jump!

230
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,931
You should've taken me with you.
Why did you jump first?

231
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,851
-How would I do that, you moron? Jump!
-My leg hurts.

232
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:01,186
Do you want to die there
or break your leg here?

233
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,813
This is nuts.

234
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,064
-Jump!
-But my leg hurts.

235
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,983
-You want to die?
-What about my leg?

236
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,818
-Se-bin.
-Yes?

237
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,820
Close your eyes and keep them shut.

238
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:11,280
Hurry up, will you?

239
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,239
Let's just go!

240
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:13,991
-I'll catch you.
-No, I can't!

241
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:15,868
Hey! Wait! Hold on!

242
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,078
Jump, asshole!

243
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,122
Damn it. Hold on. Okay.

244
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,331
Hold on. Wait.

245
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:24,376
Just leave him!
Can we get going, for God's sake?

246
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,335
Aim for here.

247
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,588
-Shit.
-What the hell are you doing?

248
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:32,134
Oh no! Wait! Help me, detective!

249
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:35,471
I mean, Jae-ik. Pull me up.
Please save me. Please.

250
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:38,849
All clear!

251
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:40,434
Here we go, sir!

252
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,061
Let's go, Ho-seong!

253
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,440
Wait. Okay, go.

254
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,410
-What does SOS mean?
-It's a distress signal.

255
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:01,080
I know that. But what does it stand for?

256
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:04,291
It doesn't stand for anything.
SOS is just SOS.

257
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:05,918
That makes no sense.

258
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,587
That's just how it is. It has no meaning.

259
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,881
Wait. Rescue quickly…

260
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,512
Why'd you ask
if you don't even believe me?

261
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,097
I thought you'd know.

262
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,016
I do know.
Look it up. You'll see I'm right.

263
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:24,061
Whatever. How can I look it up?
I don't have my phone.

264
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,729
What's wrong?

265
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:30,109
I asked On-jo what SOS meant,

266
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,319
but she said it has no meaning.

267
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:34,905
Just say you don't know.

268
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,198
It's true.

269
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,741
It's true.

270
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,327
-It is?
-Yes. She's right.

271
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,538
Why don't you believe her?

272
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,206
Hey, Prez.

273
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,333
What does SOS mean?

274
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,001
Why, that--

275
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,086
Forget it. Let him be.

276
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:51,588
No meaning?

277
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:52,756
Is it true?

278
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:55,259
What?

279
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:59,179
SOS doesn't mean anything?
It's not an acronym?

280
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,474
-You don't believe me?
-No.

281
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,354
The sun's about to set.
Let's start a fire.

282
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,107
Hey.

283
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,195
The sun's going to set.

284
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,781
I think it's working.

285
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,326
Next.

286
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,245
-Already?
-Next.

287
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:24,997
Let's do this.

288
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,797
You'll get tired. Slow down.

289
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,008
The fire won't start if he does it slowly.

290
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:39,261
Do it faster.
Come on. Faster. Twist it faster.

291
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,637
-Faster!
-Please.

292
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:42,806
Did it cramp up?

293
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:46,185
-My palms. I can't do it.
-I'll do it. Step back.

294
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:00,699
Should we kill him?

295
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:02,701
Are you praying?

296
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:05,829
Don't pray. Rub…

297
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:06,747
Get lost.

298
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:08,957
It's hard. It won't work.

299
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,713
Isn't that smoke?

300
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:16,048
-Hey. Smoke.
-Smoke!

301
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,090
-Su-hyeok.
-Hold on.

302
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,133
-Please. Come on.
-Blow.

303
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,302
Blow. Blow on it already!

304
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,887
-Be careful.
-Blow.

305
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,889
Did it catch on fire? Su-hyeok?

306
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,767
-Please. I'm begging you.
-Fuck.

307
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,185
Shit.

308
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:32,231
I'll do it.

309
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,031
-Hey.
-Do it faster.

310
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:42,950
Hey.

311
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,747
Use this.

312
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,087
I smoke.

313
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:02,844
You had that all along…

314
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,348
You don't want it?

315
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:10,894
Light it.

316
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,689
MUNPYEONG DAYCARE

317
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,242
Traitor.

318
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:26,326
Traitor.

319
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,370
I came back and saved you.

320
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:31,039
You abandoned me and fled by yourself.

321
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,250
I found this bus and came back for you.

322
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,003
Seriously, man.
You need to use your brain.

323
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,129
What did you…

324
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,674
-Do you have a license to drive a bus?
-No.

325
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:41,758
I have a regular license.

326
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:46,054
I'll bust you once we get there.
Starting with driving without a license--

327
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:53,103
What was that? It's a zombie, isn't it?

328
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:55,480
Since when do zombies ride bikes?

329
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,524
-Dumbass. Hey, Oyster.
-Orange.

330
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:58,650
Take the baby.

331
00:21:58,734 --> 00:21:59,860
Careful.

332
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:00,986
Be careful.

333
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:02,779
Open the door.

334
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,740
Seriously?

335
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:10,620
You're dead if you betray me again.

336
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,164
If I turn, I'll only go after you.

337
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:14,708
-I'll bite only your neck. Got it?
-Okay.

338
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:20,422
Oh my goodness.

339
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,301
Hey.

340
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:26,636
Are you okay?

341
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:32,017
You weren't bitten or anything, right?

342
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:34,644
You're okay, right?

343
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,481
I'm fine.

344
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,777
Come with us. I'm a cop.

345
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:45,947
Hey!

346
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:49,951
Mister!

347
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:50,952
It's okay!

348
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,954
The soldiers are here. They're soldiers.

349
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:55,582
We're saved!

350
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:57,709
What was that?

351
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:03,924
Hey!

352
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:04,883
Don't shoot!

353
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:07,469
I'm a cop. Hold on. I'm a cop.

354
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:09,805
Don't shoot! Here!

355
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:15,727
Chin down. Extend your left arm.
Don't stick out your chest too much.

356
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:18,897
This is so damn sexy.

357
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:24,778
-What's with the face?
-Don't bother if that's your mindset.

358
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:27,239
Stop being cocky
about shooting some stupid arrows.

359
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:32,869
Hey. Why did I miss?

360
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,287
Did you think it was easy?

361
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,790
Anything is easier than studying.

362
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:39,584
You get into Seoul University
if you're in the top 100.

363
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,503
But if we're 100th in the country,

364
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:43,505
we can't go anywhere.

365
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:47,634
We can't make the national team,
get into college or a corporate team.

366
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,679
There's nothing we can do.

367
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,348
Everyone knows
you'll make the national team.

368
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:56,435
You'll go to college
just by shooting arrows so stop whining.

369
00:23:58,353 --> 00:23:59,688
Damn it.

370
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:07,696
Did you not?

371
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:11,032
You didn't make the national team?
You can't go to college?

372
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:28,049
You won't die if you don't go to college.

373
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:32,888
I really like shooting arrows.

374
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,058
All I did was archery.

375
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,604
I don't know how to do anything else.

376
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:43,398
As long I can keep doing it,

377
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,193
I don't care whether I go to college
or join a corporate team.

378
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,070
But now

379
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,782
there's nowhere for me to shoot arrows.

380
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:58,371
I'm only 19.

381
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:01,708
But I have no hope.

382
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:06,838
If the zombies kill all the archers,

383
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:08,673
you'll automatically make
the national team.

384
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:12,719
Crazy bitch. You call that a consolation?

385
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:14,054
It's hope.

386
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,473
At least you have possibilities.

387
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:20,018
It's impossible for me
to get into college even if I live.

388
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:21,228
The CSAT? Fuck it.

389
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:24,064
My answers are always C or D.

390
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,066
Why C or D?

391
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:29,319
I pick C if I'm not sure
and D if I'm clueless.

392
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:33,073
I swear it's like
I avoid all the right answers.

393
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:39,162
Enough whining.
Teach me how to shoot arrows.

394
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:42,582
Even if I suck,
it's better than you shooting alone.

395
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:58,515
Dae-su.

396
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,267
Yes?

397
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:02,435
How was your audition?

398
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,355
They told me to lose weight.

399
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:09,442
You're a good singer.

400
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,029
Sing for us. I want to hear it.

401
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,824
Forget it. I don't want to sing.

402
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,618
I really like that song.

403
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:21,329
You do?

404
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,581
Yes.

405
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:23,665
Really?

406
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:24,666
It's really nice.

407
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:27,377
You sing well.

408
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:29,254
It'll cheer us up.

409
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,468
Let's go once it's over

410
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:41,016
Let's go anywhere

411
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:45,186
Once we're done studying 12 hours a day

412
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,523
Once the annoying sounds are over

413
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:52,861
Let's go hand in hand

414
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:57,324
Let's not run

415
00:26:57,907 --> 00:27:01,661
Let's try walking slowly

416
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:09,628
Is that drool or sweat pooled on the book?

417
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:11,463
No one notices the plop, plop

418
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:13,673
The plop, plop

419
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:17,594
The falling rain drops

420
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:22,015
What is boiling? Simmer, simmer

421
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:26,102
It's Mom's doenjang stew

422
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:30,398
A bowl of instant noodles

423
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:34,611
In front of the TV
Which plays nothing but static

424
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:40,867
Let's go anywhere together

425
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:05,809
I have to get to the rooftop, damn it.

426
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:50,580
…but the cops

427
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:53,583
and firefighters never came.

428
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,377
If anyone sees this later,

429
00:29:58,254 --> 00:29:59,214
please punish

430
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,258
everyone who should have come.

431
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:05,553
I'm fine. The kids are really good to me.

432
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,555
Want to see them?

433
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,060
Mom.

434
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:14,145
I want a raise in my allowance.

435
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,856
Here.

436
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:18,942
-Is it ready to go?
-Yes.

437
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:24,864
Music and lyrics
by intergalactic superstar Yang Dae-su.

438
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:30,078
Chicken tastes better fried in olive oil

439
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:33,832
Pork tastes better than soy meat

440
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:37,418
What makes me laugh, laugh, laugh

441
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:41,297
Is trans fat

442
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:42,340
I'm hungry.

443
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:45,134
How can you sing right now?

444
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:48,596
Isn't everyone leaving a final message?

445
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:51,140
Why is it final? Are we dying?

446
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,395
Hello.

447
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:58,064
I'm Oh Joon-yeong, class of '23
at Seoul University Business School.

448
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:00,149
I'll meet you soon, upperclassmen.

449
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:04,320
And once I'm there,
I want to get a girlfriend.

450
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:05,613
No, you can't.

451
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,323
What the hell?

452
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:10,743
Mom.

453
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:12,745
It's me.

454
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,248
Dad, you're okay too, right?

455
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:20,461
Mom. Listen. Don't freak out, okay?

456
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:24,966
You're the only person
I can share this with.

457
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,760
Gyeong-su's dead, Mom.

458
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:31,973
Because I called him over.

459
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:37,854
I did it
in case he'd bite the others, but…

460
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:41,691
it's my fault he died.

461
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:50,450
Please let his grandma know.

462
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:55,413
Put it gently so it doesn't shock her…

463
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:58,207
too much.

464
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:06,716
Gyeong-su wanted to work part-time
at our restaurant.

465
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:13,264
But I said no because he'd try
to eat free chicken every day.

466
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,062
I should have just let him.

467
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:37,413
PTA DONATIONS

468
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:44,837
You killed him.

469
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:47,548
You wiped that blood
with your handkerchief.

470
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,884
You rubbed that
on Gyeong-su's wound, right?

471
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,053
Like his blood is clean?

472
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:54,055
He became a zombie.

473
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:57,308
Nam-ra, that's enough.

474
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:01,437
It's true. Na-yeon killed Gyeong-su.

475
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:03,690
-Calm down.
-How could you--

476
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:05,108
Why did you kill him?

477
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:09,612
You're… a murderer.

478
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:29,132
-Leave.
-You killed me.

479
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:31,676
Leave.

480
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,094
Please leave.

481
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:35,304
You killed me.

482
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:05,376
What a nice song.

483
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:07,587
You said it sucked.

484
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,340
Now that I actually listened to it,
I think it's nice.

485
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,760
That was encouraging, Dae-su.

486
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,057
When did you

487
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:21,893
start smoking?

488
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,730
Since the eighth grade.

489
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:29,400
I had no friends
and no outlet to relieve stress.

490
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:37,241
Did you ever need a friend?

491
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:39,285
I'm not sure.

492
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:41,871
I can't tell.

493
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:46,626
You always put up a wall.

494
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:51,589
You always wore earphones
and never said a word.

495
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,302
Wasn't it because you didn't like us?

496
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,565
I never disliked you guys.

497
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,778
I just…

498
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,241
didn't have any friends.

499
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,618
To be honest,

500
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:24,497
I didn't like you.

501
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:32,088
Because I thought you didn't talk to us
because we were beneath you.

502
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,048
To be honest,

503
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:38,177
there were times
when I wished you weren't around.

504
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:43,683
Aren't you two close?
You're the top two students in our school.

505
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:45,143
That's why I hated her.

506
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:47,645
No matter how hard I tried,
I was always second.

507
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:50,690
But it's okay now.

508
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:55,111
I think I was able
to come in second thanks to Nam-ra.

509
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:59,949
Hey. Second place is good too.

510
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:04,495
I can't even come in 20th
in our class. Right?

511
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,873
Hey.

512
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:09,625
Don't compare yourself to Joon-yeong.

513
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,961
I was just saying.

514
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:14,714
Why do you always jump down my throat
when I say something?

515
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:19,260
Do you like me?

516
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,346
Screw you.

517
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:25,975
I'll put it out there
so you don't get hurt.

518
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,603
I like someone else.

519
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,396
So don't like me.

520
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:32,899
I don't like you.

521
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:35,151
I'm not interested at all.

522
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:37,445
Dae-su. Who do you like?

523
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,488
He's a total freak.

524
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,743
-His sister.
-Ha-ri from Archery?

525
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:45,912
You're insane.

526
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:47,622
I go crazy when I'm in love.

527
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:51,125
She's like Cupid in my eyes.

528
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,752
Stop it.

529
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:55,755
If we get out of here alive,
I'll tell my sister.

530
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:57,590
Will you really?

531
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:58,591
-Yes.
-About what?

532
00:36:58,674 --> 00:36:59,800
To shoot and kill you.

533
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:01,761
I said not to like my sister.

534
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:05,681
-Brother-in-law. You can't do that to me.
-You hog.

535
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,225
-Will you tell her?
-To kill you.

536
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:10,478
-Don't do that. Seriously. I love her.
-Stop it.

537
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:22,198
Gyeong-su…

538
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,840
Ms. Park.

539
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:22,758
It's Gyeong-su.

540
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,470
They're all Gyeong-su.

541
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,180
Na-yeon.

542
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:34,478
You were scared.
So were the others. That's all.

543
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:38,482
So make sure you go back to them later.

544
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:44,405
Go to them and tell them…

545
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:47,908
and tell Gyeong-su

546
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:50,536
that you're sorry.

547
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:54,790
Na-yeon.

548
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:57,293
Stay alive.

549
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:00,212
Stay alive…

550
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:06,302
and help your friends.

551
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:12,183
Do anything you can to help them--

552
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:32,787
Na-yeon.

553
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:36,791
It wasn't your fault.

554
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,043
It was my fault.

555
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:43,714
I'm sorry for cornering you.

556
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:58,145
You…

557
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:03,234
Na-yeon, you have to live.

558
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:16,432
INSTRUMENT STORAGE

559
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,906
My mom and dad
prepared everything for my transfer.

560
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:34,992
They said to just go to Seoul.

561
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:39,038
But I really didn't want to go.

562
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,587
I wouldn't have any friends,
and I was afraid of Seoul kids.

563
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,049
I didn't know what to do.

564
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:54,595
Then On-jo gave me a great idea.

565
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:59,391
She said to cut school for five days.

566
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:04,063
Then the principal couldn't write
a recommendation.

567
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:07,274
That's why I cut school.

568
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:11,904
It's all thanks to On-jo…

569
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,199
that I didn't transfer.

570
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,746
But I should've just gone.

571
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,335
Then this wouldn't have happened to me.

572
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:30,089
My sister was told

573
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:34,051
she was an archery prodigy
ever since she was a child.

574
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:37,972
So our family only cared about

575
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:41,350
whether or not she made it
onto the national team.

576
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:45,062
They gave me no attention.

577
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,191
I give you attention, brother-in-law.

578
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:51,527
Don't be sad. You have me--

579
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,365
Thank God I have Dae-su.

580
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:03,664
I don't really have anything to say.

581
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:07,793
I wouldn't really know…

582
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,256
but I feel like I made friends.

583
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:30,608
On-jo

584
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:33,319
and I…

585
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:10,064
What's that?

586
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:12,566
-What are you doing here?
-Me?

587
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:16,570
I have to go to the rooftop,

588
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:19,156
but the door's locked.

589
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:23,827
So I'm going to go that way.

590
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:30,542
-You're not a zombie, right?
-Zombie? Fuck that.

591
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:36,799
Is that food?

592
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:41,804
Are you hungry?

593
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:45,849
Are you?

594
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:48,394
Are you hungry?

595
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:55,859
Me too.

596
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:16,922
I just…

597
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:19,591
I just want some water.

598
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:21,677
Not things like that.

599
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:24,263
Be completely honest.

600
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:28,767
Be completely honest. Do you like someone?

601
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:37,568
-Yes.
-Really? You do?

602
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:44,867
Yes.

603
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:49,621
Why are you stalling? Is it a crush?

604
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:52,708
Pretty much.

605
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:54,793
Pretty much? What does that mean?

606
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:58,464
Who is she?

607
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:09,683
No one.

608
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:11,435
Who is she?

609
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:13,187
Do I know her?

610
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:16,231
Who?

611
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:18,734
You.

612
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:21,487
You, On-jo.

613
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:24,531
I like you.

614
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:30,245
Hey. Stop that.

615
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:35,501
He doesn't mean it. He's just kidding.

616
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,298
We were friends and neighbors
since kindergarten, that's all.

617
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:45,636
Stop joking.

618
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:48,680
I'm not joking.

619
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:52,559
I've liked you every day
for the past 12 years

620
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,437
since we were six years old.

621
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:59,149
And I'll continue to.

622
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:05,697
Shocking.

623
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:27,386
Cheong-san.

624
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:46,780
-Did you know? I had no idea.
-You're the only one who didn't know.

625
00:47:47,614 --> 00:47:49,283
-Everyone knew?
-Yes.

626
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:51,577
Why didn't I know?

627
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,370
-I didn't either.
-Because you're you.

628
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:54,621
Cheong-san's so cool.

629
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:03,171
On-jo.

630
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:09,636
I'm sorry.

631
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:14,016
You don't have to like me.

632
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:15,100
Stop.

633
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:16,184
I'm done.

634
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:20,063
I said it all, so it's all good.

635
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,399
How is it all good? You jerk.

636
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:25,235
You were my best friend.

637
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:30,324
I-sak's gone, and you're gone.

638
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:35,537
What do you want me to do?

639
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:15,035
Have you… never liked me?

640
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:23,669
Not even by mistake?

641
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:28,006
Not even once?

642
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:34,012
Would you please go away?

643
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,183
I want to be alone.

644
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,355
You don't have to like me.

645
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:04,561
On-jo!

646
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:11,568
-Cheong-san!
-What the hell?

647
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:19,284
Give me your eye, asshole.

648
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,652
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCATIONS, INSTITUTIONS,

649
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:25,071
AND EVENTS IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTIONAL.
