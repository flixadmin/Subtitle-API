166
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,560
there would have been
double the casualties.

167
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,200
My best friend
would've been a treasured memory.

168
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,880
You know,
sometimes exactly what I want to hear

169
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,800
isn't exactly what I want to hear.

170
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,880
How long before you trust me?

171
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,600
It's not you I don't trust.

172
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,200
Thor, report on the Hulk.

173
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,280
The gates of Hel are filled with
the screams of his victims.

174
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,160
(GROANS SOFTLY)

175
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,280
But not the screams of the dead,
of course. No, no, wounded screams.

176
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,600
Mainly whimpering,
a great deal of complaining

177
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,720
and tales of sprained deltoids and gout.

178
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,080
Hey, Banner,
Dr. Cho is on her way in from Seoul.

179
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,680
Is it okay if she sets up in your lab?

180
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,720
Uh, yeah, she knows her way around.

181
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,120
Thanks. Tell her to prep everything.

182
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,560
Barton's gonna need the full treatment.

183
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,600
-JARVIS: <i>Very good, sir.</i>
-Jarvis, take the wheel.

184
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,040
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

185
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,040
<i>Approach vector is locked.</i>

186
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,600
STARK: Feels good, yeah?

187
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,800
I mean, you've been after this thing
since S.H.I.E.L.D. collapsed.

188
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,960
Not that I haven't enjoyed
our little raiding parties, but...

189
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,480
No, but this... This brings it to a close.

190
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,080
As soon as we find out
what else this has been used for.

191
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,440
I don't just mean weapons.

192
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,280
Since when is Strucker capable
of human enhancement?

193
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,680
Banner and I will give it the once over
before it goes back to Asgard.

194
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,840
Is that cool with you?

195
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,960
Just a few days till the farewell party.

196
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,240
You're staying, right?

197
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,080
Yes, yes, of course.
A victory should be honored with revels.

198
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,960
Yeah, who doesn't love revels? Captain?

199
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,000
Hopefully this puts an end
to the Chitauri and Hydra.

200
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,760
So, yes, revels.

201
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,400
(SPEAKING KOREAN)

202
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,880
Lab's all set up, boss.

203
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,120
Oh, actually, he's the boss.

204
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,640
I just pay for everything
and design everything

205
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,320
and make everyone look cooler.

206
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,840
What's the word on Strucker?

207
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,000
-NATO's got him.
-The two Enhanced?

208
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,720
Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. Twins.

209
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,680
Orphaned at 10 when a shell
collapsed their apartment building.

210
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,320
Sokovia's had a rough history.

211
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,880
It's nowhere special, but it's
on the way to everywhere special.

212
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,160
Their abilities?

213
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,320
He's got increased metabolism

214
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,120
and improved thermal homeostasis.

215
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,360
Her thing is neuroelectric interfacing,

216
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,560
telekinesis, mental manipulation.

217
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,800
He's fast and she's weird.

218
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,720
-Well, they're gonna show up again.
-(BEEPING)

219
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,760
Agreed. File says they volunteered

220
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,680
for Strucker's experiments.

221
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,680
-It's nuts.
-Right.

222
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,000
What kind of monster would let
a German scientist experiment on them

223
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,360
to protect their country?

224
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,240
We're not at war, Captain.

225
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,080
They are.

226
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,000
(WHIRRING)

227
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,520
How's he doing?

228
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,880
Unfortunately, he's still Barton.

229
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,360
That's terrible.

230
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,080
He's fine. He's thirsty.

231
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,080
All right. Look alive, Jarvis. It's playtime.

232
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,200
We've only got
a couple of days with this joystick,

233
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,240
so let's make the most of it.

234
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,920
Update me on the structural
and compositional analysis.

235
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,080
JARVIS: <i>The scepter is alien.</i>

236
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,240
<i>There are elements I can't quantify.</i>

237
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,760
So there's elements you can?

238
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,920
<i>The jewel appears to be</i>
<i>a protective housing</i>

239
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,480
<i>for something inside,</i>

240
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,920
<i>something powerful.</i>

241
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,120
Like a reactor?

242
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,480
<i>Like a computer.</i>

243
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,760
<i>I believe I'm deciphering code.</i>

244
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,640
Are you sure he's gonna be okay?

245
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,280
Pretending to need this guy
really brings the team together.

246
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,920
DR. CHO: There's
no possibility of deterioration.

247
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,200
The nano-molecular functionality
is instantaneous.

248
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,280
His cells don't know
they're bonding with simulacra.

249
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,320
She's creating tissue.

250
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,840
If you brought him to my lab,

251
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,560
the Regeneration Cradle
could do this in 20 minutes.

252
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,600
Oh, he's flat-lining. Call it. Time?

253
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,160
BARTON: No, no, no,
I'm gonna live forever.

254
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,840
(LAUGHS) I'm gonna be made of plastic.

255
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,280
STARK: Here's your beverage.

256
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,120
You'll be made of you, Mr. Barton.

257
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,840
Your own girlfriend
won't be able to tell the difference.

258
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,080
I don't have a girlfriend.

259
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,480
That I can't fix.

260
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,320
This is the next thing, Tony.

261
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,480
Your clunky metal suits
are gonna be left in the dust.

262
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,360
That is exactly the plan.

263
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,160
And, Helen, I expect to see you
at the party on Saturday.

264
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,720
Unlike you,
I don't have a lot of time for parties.

265
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,000
Will Thor be there?

266
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,480
-BANNER: What's the rumpus?
-Well, the scepter.

267
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:57,280
You see, we were wondering
how Strucker got so inventive.

268
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,320
So I've been analyzing the gem inside.

269
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,840
You may recognize...

270
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,680
-Jarvis.
-JARVIS: <i>Doctor.</i>

271
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,760
Started out,
Jarvis was just a natural language UI.

272
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,920
Now he runs the Iron Legion.

273
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,680
He runs more of the business

274
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,160
-than anyone besides Pepper.
-Oh.

275
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,400
-Top of the line.
-Yes.

276
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,800
JARVIS: <i>I suspect not for long.</i>

277
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,120
Meet the competition.

278
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,360
-It's beautiful.
-If you had to guess,

279
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,480
-what's it look like it's doing?
-Like it's thinking.

280
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,040
I mean, this could be...

281
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,560
-It's not a human mind.
-Mmm-mmm.

282
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,720
I mean, look at this.

283
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,040
They're like neurons firing.

284
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,720
Down in Strucker's lab, I saw
some fairly advanced robotics work.

285
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,400
They deep-sixed the data,

286
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,640
but I gotta guess he was
knocking on a very particular door.

287
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,920
Artificial intelligence.

288
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,800
This could be it, Bruce.
This could be the key to creating Ultron.

289
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,320
(BOTH CHUCKLE SOFTLY)

290
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,760
I thought Ultron was a fantasy.

291
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,160
Yesterday it was.

292
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,320
If we can harness this power,

293
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,480
apply it to my Iron Legion protocol?

294
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,240
That's a man-sized "if."

295
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,720
Our job is "if."

296
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,440
What if you were sipping margaritas
on a sun-drenched beach,

297
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,080
turning brown instead of green?

298
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,560
Not looking
over your shoulder for Veronica.

299
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,280
Don't hate. I helped design Veronica.

300
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,200
As a worst-case measure, right?

301
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,920
How about a best case?

302
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,960
What if the world was safe?

303
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,880
What if, next time aliens roll up
to the club, and they will,

304
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,920
they couldn't get past the bouncer?

305
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,480
The only people threatening the planet
would be people.

306
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,240
I want to apply this
to the Ultron program.

307
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,760
But Jarvis can't download
a data schematic this dense.

308
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,760
We can only do it
while we have the scepter here.

309
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,440
That's three days. Give me three days.

310
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,160
So you're going for artificial intelligence,

311
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,600
and you don't want to tell the team?

312
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,160
Right. That's right. You know why?

313
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,920
Because we don't have time
for a city hall debate.

314
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,640
I don't want to hear "the man was
not meant to meddle" medley.

315
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,880
I see a suit of armor around the world.

316
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,920
Sounds like a cold world, Tony.

317
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,760
I've seen colder.

318
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,480
This one, this very vulnerable blue one,

319
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,080
it needs Ultron.

320
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,400
Peace in our time.

321
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,440
Imagine that.

322

Then we'll do that together, too.

Thor's right. Ultron's calling us out.

641

why you can't look inside my head.

Sometimes it's hard.

643

But sooner or later,
every man shows himself.

644

Oh, I'm sure they do.

645
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,120
But you needed
something more than a man.

646
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,480
That's why you let
Stark take the scepter.

647
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,880
I didn't expect,

648
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,320
but I saw Stark's fear.

649
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,200
I knew it would control him.

650
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,160
Make him self-destruct.

655
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
smaller people? Uh...

656
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:29,200
"Children." (CHUCKLES)
I lost the word, there.

657
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,680
Children

658
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,080
designed to supplant them,

659
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,000
to help them end.

660
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,800
Is that why you've come,

661
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,040
to end the Avengers?

662
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,480
I've come to save the world.

663
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,800
But also... Yeah.

664
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,680
We'll move out right away.

665
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,320
This is a start, but there's something

666
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,960
we need to begin the real work.

667

-All of these are...
-ULTRON: Me.

668

I have what the Avengers
never will. Harmony.

669
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,520
They're discordant. Disconnected.

670
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,480
Stark's already got them
turning on each other.

671
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,040
And when you get inside
the rest of their heads...

672
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,320
Everyone's plan is not to kill them.

673
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,920
And make them martyrs?

674
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,120
You need patience.

675
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,960

676
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:19,360
I don't see the big picture.
I have a little picture.

677
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,160
I take it out and look at it,

678
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,120
every day.

679
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,080
You lost your parents in the
bombings. I've seen the records.

680
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,360

We were 10 years old.
Having dinner, the four of us.

683
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,560
When the first shell hits,
two floors below,

684
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,720
it makes a hole in the floor.

685
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,400
It's big.

686
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,600
Our parents go in

687
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,800
and the whole building
starts coming apart.

688
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,040
I grab her,

689
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,840
roll under the bed,
and the second shell hits.

690
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,120
But it doesn't go off.

691
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,800
It just

692
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,240
sits there in the rubble.

693
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,520
Three feet from our faces.

694
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,600
And on the side of the shell

695
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,080
is painted one word.

696
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,920
"Stark."

697

I think, "This will set it off."

701
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,040
We wait for two days

702
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,440

01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:38,680
I think you're being hard on yourself.

1134
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:43,240
Here I was hoping that was your job.

1135
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:47,760
What are you doing?

1136
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:51,200
I'm running with it.

1137
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:54,120
With you.

1138
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:57,240
If running is the plan,

1139
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:00,080
as far as you want.

1140
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,720
Are you out of your mind?

1141
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:10,480
I want you to understand that, um...

1142
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:12,000
Natasha,

1143
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:14,560
where can I go?

1144
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:17,960
Where in the world am I not a threat?

1145
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:20,400
-You're not a threat to me.
-Are you sure?

1146
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:23,120
Even if I didn't just...

1147
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:26,120
There's no future with me.

1148
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:28,800
I can't ever...

1149
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:31,280
I can't have this.

1150
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,120
Kids.

1151
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:36,160
Do the math. I physically can't.

1152
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:39,360
Neither can I.

1153
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:47,560
In the Red Room where I was trained...

1154
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:50,520
Where I was raised, um,

1155
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:54,120
they have a graduation ceremony.

1156
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:57,560
They sterilize you.

1157
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:02,200
It's efficient.

1158
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:06,480
One less thing to worry about.

1159
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:11,960
The one thing
that might matter more than a mission.

1160
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:16,240
Makes everything easier.

1161
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:18,840
Even killing.

1162
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:27,040
You still think
you're the only monster on the team?

1163
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:35,280
So, we disappear?

1164
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:43,600
Thor didn't say
where he was going for answers?

1165
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:47,160
Sometimes my teammates
don't tell me things.

1166
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:50,320
I was kind of hoping
Thor would be the exception.

1167
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:52,480
Yeah, give him time.

1168
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:54,520
We don't know
what the Maximoff kid showed him.

1169
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:58,360
"Earth's mightiest heroes."

1170
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:00,080
Pulled us apart like cotton candy.

1171
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:01,680
Seems like you walked away all right.

1172
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:05,360
Is that a problem?

1173
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:07,640
I don't trust a guy without a dark side.

1174
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:09,920
Call me old-fashioned.

1175
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:12,560
Well, let's just say
you haven't seen it yet.

1176
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:15,080
You know Ultron is trying
to tear us apart, right?

1177
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:17,560
Well, I guess you'd know.

1178
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:18,960
Whether you'd tell us
is a bit of a question.

1179
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:20,240
Banner and I were doing research.

1180
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:22,480
-That would affect the team.
-That would end the team!

1181
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:23,920
Isn't that the mission?

1182
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:25,360
Isn't that the "Why We Fight"?

1183
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:27,720
So we can end the fight.
So we get to go home!

1184
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:33,360
Every time someone tries
to win a war before it starts,

1185
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:35,000
innocent people die.

1186
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:36,120
Every time.

1187
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:41,000
I'm sorry. Mr. Stark...

1188
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:42,960
Clint said you wouldn't mind,

1189
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:45,600
but our tractor doesn't seem
to want to start at all.

1190
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:48,120
-I thought maybe you might...
-Yeah, I'll give her a kick.

1191
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:53,280
Don't take from my pile.

1192
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:55,440
(DOOR OPENS)

1193
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:04,720
Hello, Deere.

1194
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:08,960
Tell me everything.

1195
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:11,600
What ails you?

1196
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:12,800
FURY: Do me a favor.

1197
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:16,960
Try not to bring it to life.

1198
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:18,640
Why, Ms. Barton, you little minx.

1199
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,520
I get it. Maria Hill called you, right?

1200
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:22,920
Was she ever not working for you?

1201
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:24,520
Artificial intelligence.

1202
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:27,240
You never even hesitated.

1203
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:28,800
Look, it's been a really long day,

1204
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:30,560
like Eugene O'Neill long,

1205
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:32,640
so how's about
we skip to the part where you're useful.

1206
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,120
Look me in the eye and tell me

1207
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:35,480
you're going to shut him down.

1208
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:37,200
You're not the director of me.

1209
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:39,160
I'm not the director of anybody.

1210
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:41,080
I'm just an old man

1211
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:43,320
who cares very much about you.

1212
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:48,000
And I'm the man
who killed the Avengers.

1213
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:50,960
I saw it.

1214
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:52,720
I didn't tell the team. How could I?

1215
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,840
I saw them all dead, Nick. I felt it.

1216
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:57,720
The whole world, too.

1217
01:10:58,160 --> 01:10:59,160
Because of me.

1218
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:01,840
I wasn't ready.

1219
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:04,720
I didn't do all I could.

1220
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:07,840
Maximoff girl, she's working you, Stark.

1221
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:12,000
-Playing on your fear.
-I wasn't tricked, I was shown.

1222
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:14,360
Wasn't a nightmare, it was my legacy.

1223
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:16,880
The end of the path I started us on.

1224
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:19,840
You come up with some pretty
impressive inventions, Tony.

1225
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:23,520
War isn't one of them.

1226
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:28,560
I watched my friends die.

1227
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:30,840
You'd think that'd be
as bad as it gets, right?

1228
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:32,040
(SCOFFS)

1229
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:33,720
Nope.

1230
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:37,240
-It wasn't the worst part.
-The worst part

1231
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:39,560
is that you didn't.

1232
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:47,360
SELVIG: I'll see you tonight.

1233
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:51,400
I like the look.

1234
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:55,120
If you're going for inconspicuous,
though, near miss.

1235
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:56,480
I need your help.

1236
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:57,720
It's nice to be needed.

1237
01:11:58,120 --> 01:11:59,480
It's dangerous.

1238
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:01,880
I'd be disappointed if it wasn't.

1239
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:08,080
FURY: Ultron took you folks out of play
to buy himself time.

1240
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:11,400
My contacts all say
he's building something.

1241
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:14,120
The amount of vibranium
he made off with,

1242
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:15,720
I don't think it's just one thing.

1243
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,160
What about Ultron himself?

1244
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:19,640
FURY: Oh, he's easy to track.
He's everywhere.

1245
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:22,480
The guy is multiplying faster
than a Catholic rabbit.

1246
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:25,920
It still doesn't help us get an angle
on any of his plans, though.

1247
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:27,280
Is he still going after launch codes?

1248
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:28,880
FURY: Yes, he is.

1249
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,480
But he's not making any headway.

1250
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:32,680
I cracked the Pentagon's firewall
in high school on a dare.

1251
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:35,400
Well, I contacted our friends
at the Nexus about that.

1252
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:36,480
Nexus?

1253
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:38,240
BANNER: It's the world
Internet hub in Oslo.

1254
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:40,440
Every byte of data flows through there.

1255
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:41,720
Fastest access on Earth.

1256
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:42,960
So, what did they say?

1257
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:44,960
FURY: He's fixated on the missiles.

1258
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:46,800
But the codes
are constantly being changed.

1259
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:48,320
By whom?

1260
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:50,800
Parties unknown.

1261
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:52,080
Do we have an ally?

1262
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:54,560
Ultron's got an enemy.
That's not the same thing.

1263
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:56,720
Still, I'd pay folding money
to know who it is.

1264
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:58,000
I might need to visit Oslo.

1265
01:12:58,520 --> 01:12:59,640
Find our unknown.

1266
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:01,240
Well, this is good times, boss,

1267
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:02,640
but I was kind of hoping when I saw you,

1268
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:03,760
you'd have more than that.

1269
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:06,040
I do. I have you.

1270
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:08,680
Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere.

1271
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:10,160
Ears, everywhere else.

1272
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:13,480
You kids had all the tech
you could dream up.

1273
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:16,480
Here we all are, back on Earth,

1274
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:18,480
with nothing but our wit

1275
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:20,200
and our will to save the world.

1276
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:24,000
Ultron says the Avengers
are the only thing

1277
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:25,600
between him and his mission.

1278
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:27,920
And whether or not he admits it,

1279
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:30,800
his mission is global destruction.

1280
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,160
All this, laid in a grave.

1281
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:37,880
So stand.

1282
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:40,400
Outwit the platinum bastard.

1283
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:42,280
Steve doesn't like that kind of talk.

1284
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:43,800
You know what, Romanoff?

1285
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,320
So, what does he want?

1286
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:49,760
To become better.

1287
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:51,280
Better than us.

1288
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:54,000
-He keeps building bodies.
-Person bodies.

1289
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:56,240
The human form is inefficient.

1290
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:58,520
Biologically speaking, we're outmoded.

1291
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:00,600
But he keeps coming back to it.

1292

02:07:57,920 --> 02:07:59,640
"Wish you were here."

2096
02:08:01,600 --> 02:08:04,880
You sent me to recruit him
way back when.

2097
02:08:06,720 --> 02:08:09,280
Did you know then
what was gonna happen?

2098
02:08:11,480 --> 02:08:13,400
You never know.

2099
02:08:13,600 --> 02:08:17,120
You hope for the best,
then make do with what you get.

2100
02:08:17,600 --> 02:08:19,080
I got a great team.

2101
02:08:20,200 --> 02:08:22,160
Nothing lasts forever.

2102
02:08:22,440 --> 02:08:24,480
Trouble, Ms. Romanoff.

2103
02:08:24,760 --> 02:08:28,080
No matter who wins or loses,
trouble still comes around.

2104
02:08:31,960 --> 02:08:33,160
ROGERS: <i>The rules have changed.</i>

2105
02:08:33,360 --> 02:08:34,960
STARK: We're dealing
with something new.

2106
02:08:35,120 --> 02:08:36,440
Oh, the Vision is artificial intelligence.

2107
02:08:36,560 --> 02:08:38,480
-A machine.
-So, it doesn't count?

2108
02:08:38,640 --> 02:08:40,480
No, it's not like
a person lifting the hammer.

2109
02:08:40,720 --> 02:08:42,400
Right, different rules for us.

2110
02:08:42,600 --> 02:08:43,640
-Nice guy. Artificial.
-ROGERS: Thank you.

2111
02:08:43,840 --> 02:08:46,720
He can wield the hammer,
he can keep the Mind Stone.

2112
02:08:47,640 --> 02:08:49,720
It's safe with the Vision.

2113
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,480
And these days, safe is in short supply.

2114
02:08:54,520 --> 02:08:56,480
But if you put the hammer
in an elevator...

2115
02:08:56,600 --> 02:08:58,400
-It would still go up.
-Elevator's not worthy.

2116
02:08:58,520 --> 02:09:00,320
I'm gonna miss these little talks of ours.

2117
02:09:00,480 --> 02:09:02,000
Not if you don't leave.

2118
02:09:02,240 --> 02:09:03,960
I have no choice.

2119
02:09:04,200 --> 02:09:06,360
The Mind Stone
is the fourth of the Infinity Stones

2120
02:09:06,480 --> 02:09:07,880
to show up in the last few years.

2121
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:09,600
It's not a coincidence.

2122
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:12,160
Someone has been playing
an intricate game

2123
02:09:12,320 --> 02:09:13,960
and has made pawns of us.

2124
02:09:14,080 --> 02:09:15,960
And once all these pieces
are in position...

2125
02:09:16,080 --> 02:09:17,520
Triple Yahtzee.

2126
02:09:17,720 --> 02:09:19,160
You think you can find out
what's coming?

2127
02:09:19,280 --> 02:09:20,400
I do.

2128
02:09:21,200 --> 02:09:22,680
Besides this one,

2129
02:09:22,800 --> 02:09:25,200
there's nothing that can't be explained.

2130
02:09:32,480 --> 02:09:35,040
That man has no regard
for lawn maintenance.

2131
02:09:38,160 --> 02:09:40,800
I'm gonna miss him, though.
And you're gonna miss me.

2132
02:09:40,920 --> 02:09:42,440
There's gonna be a lot of manful tears.

2133
02:09:42,600 --> 02:09:44,160
-(CAR LOCK BEEPS)
-(ENGINE STARTS)

2134
02:09:44,640 --> 02:09:46,280
I will miss you, Tony.

2135
02:09:46,520 --> 02:09:47,520
Yeah?

2136
02:09:47,720 --> 02:09:50,120
Well, it's time for me to tap out.

2137
02:09:50,360 --> 02:09:52,560
Maybe I should
take a page out of Barton's book.

2138
02:09:52,720 --> 02:09:55,640
Build Pepper a farm,
hope nobody blows it up.

2139
02:09:56,400 --> 02:09:57,600
The simple life.

2140
02:09:57,840 --> 02:10:00,120
-You'll get there one day.
-I don't know.

2141
02:10:00,400 --> 02:10:02,760
Family, stability...

2142
02:10:03,920 --> 02:10:07,040
The guy who wanted all that
went in the ice 75 years ago.

2143
02:10:08,560 --> 02:10:10,400
I think someone else came out.

2144
02:10:14,360 --> 02:10:15,440
You all right?

2145
02:10:15,640 --> 02:10:18,040
(SOLDIERS SHOUTING IN DISTANCE)

2146
02:10:18,160 --> 02:10:19,560
I'm home.

2147
02:10:27,480 --> 02:10:30,240
You wanna keep staring at the wall,
or do you wanna go to work?

2148
02:10:30,400 --> 02:10:31,760
I mean, it's a pretty interesting wall.

2149
02:10:31,920 --> 02:10:34,920
I thought you and Tony
were still gazing into each other's eyes.

2150
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:36,040
How do we look?

2151
02:10:36,280 --> 02:10:38,600
Well, we're not the '27 Yankees.

2152
02:10:38,720 --> 02:10:40,440
We got some hitters.

2153
02:10:40,600 --> 02:10:42,960
They're good. They're not a team.

2154
02:10:43,120 --> 02:10:44,760
Let's beat them into shape.

2155
02:11:03,240 --> 02:11:04,800
Avengers...

2156
02:13:23,640 --> 02:13:25,040
THANOS: Fine.

2157
02:13:26,520 --> 02:13:28,320
I'll do it myself.
