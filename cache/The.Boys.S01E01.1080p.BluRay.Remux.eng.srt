1
00:00:17,268 --> 00:00:20,146
Yo, I am so psyched for Invisible Force 2.

2
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:22,773
Please. Invisible Force 1 was lame.

3
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:24,192
I'm all about Rising Tide.

4
00:00:24,275 --> 00:00:26,360
Rising Tide? The Deep?

5
00:00:26,444 --> 00:00:28,446
Translucent could kick the Deep's ass.

6
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:31,657
How? He's invisible.
That's, like, all he's got. That's it.

7
00:00:31,741 --> 00:00:35,620
Exactly. He sneaks up on the Deep,
and then boom, motherfucker!

8
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:37,371
- Sit down.
- Until the Deep makes a shark

9
00:00:37,455 --> 00:00:39,290
bite Translucent's dick off.

10
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,292
How's he gonna find his dick? It's invisible.

11
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:51,427
Holy shit.

12
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:00,519
Benjy!

13
00:01:07,485 --> 00:01:09,070
Get up. Get up, get up, get up.

14
00:01:09,153 --> 00:01:11,489
Come on, Benjy. Come on, come on.

15
00:01:40,977 --> 00:01:42,270
Stay back.

16
00:01:42,353 --> 00:01:45,439
Just stay the fuck back.

17
00:01:45,523 --> 00:01:47,024
What are you smiling at?

18
00:02:06,419 --> 00:02:08,170
Homelander?

19
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,757
You boys okay?

20
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,887
Can I... can I get a selfie?

21
00:02:18,014 --> 00:02:19,348
Course you can.

22
00:02:21,434 --> 00:02:25,021
The Seven's Queen Maeve
and Homelander made another heroic save today,

23
00:02:25,104 --> 00:02:27,898
stopping a hijacked armoured truck
on the streets of Brooklyn,

24
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:29,442
then staying behind for a photo op

25
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:31,444
- with some very lucky fans.
- Nice to meet you.

26
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:33,070
- Jean?
- Thanks, Jennifer. And now...

27
00:02:33,154 --> 00:02:36,782
So, this is pretty much everything in one.
Bluetooth speakers.

28
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:38,284
It's in stereo, so you can put it

29
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:40,494
all around your living room,
have some fun with it.

30
00:02:40,578 --> 00:02:42,913
You said you have a standard cable box, right?

31
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:46,375
Okay, then I need to get you an audio transmitter,
aptX Low Latency.

32
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:49,795
It makes it so there's less audio lag,
and it's got a standard optical in.

33
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:52,548
And let's hook you up
with thousand-meg HDMI.

34
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:53,799
Let's go with this one.

35
00:02:53,883 --> 00:02:56,969
It costs a little bit more,
but the carbon's way more conductive.

36
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:14,195
Hey, Gary.
I really need to talk to you about something.

37
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:16,572
- Later, kid.
- Okay. Cool.

38
00:03:17,156 --> 00:03:19,909
Later... You want, like...
Want, like, 30... 30 minutes?

39
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:21,202
Like, a solid 45?

40
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:26,374
Excuse me, sir?

41
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:31,462
Hi. I'd like to make an appointment
for you to come over and...

42
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,298
lay some cable.

43
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:37,134
Okay. Oh, Robin.

44
00:03:37,218 --> 00:03:38,803
Oh, dear, dear, Robin.

45
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:42,014
That doesn't mean
what you think it means.

46
00:03:42,098 --> 00:03:44,934
"Laying cable" means sex.

47
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:46,811
No, "laying pipe" means sex.

48
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:49,980
"Laying cable" means you want me
to come over to your house

49
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:51,899
and just take a big, old shit.

50
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:53,734
- That's disgusting.
- Well, okay.

51
00:03:53,818 --> 00:03:55,194
But you... Who said it, though?

52
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:59,824
Okay. Are you ready? Despite your best efforts,
I'm actually still hungry.

53
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:02,076
I'm actually more hungry now.

54
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,204
- Where are we gonna go after all this hot talk?
- I don't know.

55
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:07,415
- You know?
- More importantly, where are we gonna go

56
00:04:07,498 --> 00:04:09,166
to lay some cable afterwards?

57
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,084
Geez.

58
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:12,211
So, did you ask him?

59
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:14,338
- Who?
- Gary.

60
00:04:14,422 --> 00:04:17,550
Did you ask Gary for the raise?

61
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:19,593
Yeah. Yeah. It was... It was a...

62
00:04:19,677 --> 00:04:22,012
Look, it was a crazy day,
and-and he was super busy,

63
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:24,723
but tomorrow for sure. Yes.

64
00:04:24,807 --> 00:04:26,725
Okay.

65
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:29,311
What was I supposed to do, kick his door down?

66
00:04:29,395 --> 00:04:31,313
Like Homelander?

67
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:32,690
I said "okay."

68
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,608
Yeah, but you didn't mean it.

69
00:04:34,692 --> 00:04:36,193
Hey, I see the look.

70
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:37,778
I see it. Come on.

71
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:43,409
This is like when we started dating.

72
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:45,828
I don't think that's... I don't think that's true.

73
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,997
Dude, I had to ask you out.

74
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,374
Well, excuse me for waiting.

75
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,251
You ever hear of chivalry?

76
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:55,546
Listen, this is about you
getting what you deserve.

77
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:56,922
I'm killing myself at school

78
00:04:57,006 --> 00:05:00,217
because I think it's gonna be
worth it for both of us.

79
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:02,845
You know, if we move in together.

80
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:06,182
Wait, what? What? Wait. Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey. What was that?

81
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:08,142
What'd you just say?

82
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:11,020
Well, I mean, we can't keep,
you know, laying pipe

83
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:12,771
at your dad's place.

84
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:14,440
Trying to be all quiet.

85
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:18,527
Staring up at that dumb
Billy Joel post...

86
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:25,743
- Poster.
- Hey.

87
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,830
Don't you ever besmirch Billy Jo...

88
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,282
I can't stop. I can't stop.
I can't stop. I can't stop.

89
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:07,409
Can't stop. Can't stop.

90
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:12,289
Robin?

91
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:18,629
Robin?

92
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:23,133
Robin!

93
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,595
Robin!

94
00:06:53,706 --> 00:06:56,083
Let the energy go through the wall.

95
00:07:05,301 --> 00:07:06,969
I am Starlight.

96
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:10,139
I'm 110 pounds, and I'm five foot six.

97
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:12,808
Turn around, please.

98
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:21,358
Okay. Let's see it, dear.

99
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:23,777
- You should look away.
- Sorry?

100
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:25,529
You should turn away from the camera,

101
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:28,824
and you should close your eyes,
or else I'll blind you.

102
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:30,451
All right.

103
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:32,745
Okay, go ahead.

104
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,130
I am so sorry.

105
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,798
Are you all right?

106
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:49,720
I was born Super-Abled.

107
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,097
My mom was thrilled.

108
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:56,060
She took me to all
the Little Miss Hero pageants,

109
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:57,686
but I hated it.

110
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:00,522
I mean, I can still...

111
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:02,858
smell the hairspray.

112
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:06,070
But...

113
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:11,492
...at the Q and A, they always
asked me what my wish was,

114
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:15,245
and I always said, "to save the world."

115
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:20,376
And the judges just chuckled like it was cute.

116
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:24,463
But it wasn't a joke to me.

117
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:32,846
Since when did "hopeful" and "naive"
become the same thing?

118
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:38,852
I mean, why would you get into this business
if not to save the world?

119
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:42,022
That's all I have ever wanted.

120
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:49,405
And that's why I've always wanted
to be in the Seven.

121
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,294
Thanks, Jennifer.

122
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:06,672
Thought Robin's service was nice.

123
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,509
Did you see how many people came?

124
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:18,142
Lot of respect for that girl.
Lot of love in the room.

125
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:20,811
And the spread. What a spread.

126
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,229
Just really nice.

127
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:27,609
- That does not begin to convey the terrible regret...
- Geez. Maybe there's a movie on.

128
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:29,194
- No, keep it.
- No, we can switch it.

129
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:30,779
Keep it.

130
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:33,490
...awful, tragic loss.

131
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:37,578
My deepest condolences to Robin Ward's family.

132
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:41,415
I was chasing these bank robbers.

133
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:45,419
She just stepped in the middle of the street,
and I couldn't...

134
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:49,506
Middle of the...
She was a half-step off the fucking curb.

135
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,676
Oh, now, come on, Hughie.
Just don't get upset, okay? Just...

136
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,261
He knows.

137
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,263
...swift, thoughtful attention...

138
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:01,560
Now I think that A-Train
would like to get back to work.

139
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:04,229
Everyone at Vought is just...

140
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:06,482
just wrecked about Robin.

141
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:10,986
Now, you two weren't married and, look...

142
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,739
technically, there's no legal claim.

143
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:17,201
But, Vought wants to do the right thing:

144
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:21,872
offer you $45,000 in restitution.

145
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:25,876
All you have to do is sign right here,

146
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,836
and I'll offer you the cheque.

147
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:32,174
This is a confidentiality agreement.

148
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:34,092
It's a boilerplate NDA.

149
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:37,429
I sign this, and...

150
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:39,598
I can't talk about it?

151
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:45,062
Have to pretend like it didn't happen,
like I wasn't holding Robin's arms in my hands?

152
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,022
Look, I know you're upset,

153
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:49,024
but we're just trying to help.

154
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:51,860
Then say you're sorry.

155
00:10:51,944 --> 00:10:53,320
Excuse me?

156
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:57,866
I mean, you people say "our condolences"
and "my sympathies" and "our regrets,"

157
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:02,496
but nobody can look me in the fucking eye
and say "I'm sorry."

158
00:11:03,247 --> 00:11:05,874
I'm not signing anything. Get out.

159
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:09,586
I said get the hell out!

160
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,469
You okay?

161
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:22,683
As I said, boilerplate NDA, really.

162
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:25,018
Pretty standard stuff.

163
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:27,354
Can I think about it?

164
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:34,403
If you have any questions at all, just...

165
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:48,375
Unit 44, code 20.
Address is 142063rd Street. Possible 10-71.

166
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:50,586
Any maniacs out there?

167
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:52,838
Quiet night.

168
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:54,131
Like every night.

169
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:55,841
That's too bad.

170
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:59,011
We could really use the press right now.

171
00:12:00,596 --> 00:12:01,889
Oh, Annie.

172
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:03,891
I'm hungry.

173
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:06,018
Don't worry. I didn't get the job.

174
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:08,145
You don't know that.

175
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:11,356
They're auditioning girls nationwide.

176
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,233
Besides, Countess probably got it.

177
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:15,068
She's so good in a room.

178
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:18,947
If you're negative, negative things happen to you.

179
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:20,741
Hello?

180
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:23,118
Yes, I'm her mother.

181
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,413
Yes.

182
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,123
One moment.

183
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:29,708
It's them.

184
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:30,959
It's them.

185
00:12:31,043 --> 00:12:33,128
Hello?

186
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:35,797
Yes, this is she.

187
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:39,760
I got it?

188
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:41,303
You got it!

189
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:42,346
You got it!

190
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:46,975
Oh, my God.

191
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:48,685
I'm so... I'm so sorry.

192
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:50,562
It's a weird connection.

193
00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:54,274
I don't know what that was, actually.

194
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:57,069
Oh, shit.

195
00:12:57,152 --> 00:12:58,278
Yeah?

196
00:12:58,362 --> 00:12:59,947
I think she was an addict.

197
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,323
Needle tracks?

198
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:03,617
12 marks on one arm.

199
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,244
More dope coming in.

200
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:07,746
More pushers at work.

201
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:09,456
What you doing?

202
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:12,209
Can't file a criminal case against A-Train.
Supes are like cops.

203
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,836
They can't be charged for damages
while they're on the job.

204
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,339
- Okay.
- But maybe we can file a wrongful death.

205
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:20,300
I just got to get Robin's
parents to sign off on it.

206
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:23,345
- Hughie, come sit with me.
- Dad, I'm not...

207
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,764
I'm right...

208
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,307
Okay.

209
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,274
Good for you.

210
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:38,986
You want to make this right,
what happened to Robin.

211
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,156
But you can't.

212
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:46,201
So sign this.

213
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,579
What?

214
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:51,581
This is a lot of money, Hughie.

215
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:53,208
We could really use it.

216
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:58,046
I can't... Dad, they killed her.

217
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,756
Be realistic, okay?

218
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,635
Even if we could pay for a lawyer...
And that's a big if... there's no case.

219
00:14:04,136 --> 00:14:08,598
- She was in the street. Be like if a bus hit her.
- Dad, she was one step off the curb.

220
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:11,059
- I saw it!
- I... Hughie, look. Look.

221
00:14:11,143 --> 00:14:13,437
- You can't do this.
- Why not?

222
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,857
- Dad, I have...
- You don't have the fight. You never have.

223
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,572
I'm sorry, but it's... It's true.

224
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,616
Neither do I.

225
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:33,582
Now, come and...
Come and sit with me, okay?

226
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:36,209
Remington Steele's on.

227
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:38,879
Hughie! Where you going?

228
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:50,307
...The red carpet outside of Vought headquarters,
here for the annual shareholders presentation...

229
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:54,102
There she is.

230
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:55,812
Welcome to New York.

231
00:14:55,896 --> 00:15:00,984
- I'm Ashley Barrett, director of talent relations.
- So are all these people here for me?

232
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:02,027
Oh, honey.

233
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,363
Who else would they be here for?

234
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:07,574
Come on. We're running late.

235
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:08,742
Oh, my God.

236
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:18,168
Ladies and gentlemen,

237
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:23,715
it is without a doubt a good time
to be in the Superhero business.

238
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:26,802
Our net income is up 14 percent.

239
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:30,305
Our latest film, G-Men: World War,

240
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:35,644
just grossed shy of $1 .7 billion world-wide.

241
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:39,773
And this fall, we break ground
on our newest theme park outside of Paris.

242
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:43,151
The branding opportunities are limitless.

243
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:48,615
But, you know, none of that really matters.

244
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:53,829
Because job one is managing, supporting,

245
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:57,124
and advising the brave heroes

246
00:15:57,207 --> 00:16:01,628
who put themselves in harm's way
each and every day...

247
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:03,839
for us.

248
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:05,465
Let's take a look.

249
00:16:12,264 --> 00:16:14,432
A world without crime,

250
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:16,768
with liberty and justice for all,

251
00:16:16,852 --> 00:16:19,229
that's within our reach,

252
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:24,151
thanks to the 200-plus Superheroes
in the Vought Family.

253
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:26,194
We see a bright future ahead,

254
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:29,990
where there is a Vought Hero in every town.

255
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:33,660
You're doing really well, by the way, so far.

256
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:36,580
- I... I haven't done anything yet.
- Yeah, exactly.

257
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:39,082
You're already up two-and-a-half points
with Midwesterners

258
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,042
and conservative Christians in 18 to 49.

259
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:43,503
That speech, by the way, your audition...

260
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:46,298
It was modest, it was humble.

261
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:48,550
Really fucking smart choice.

262
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:51,261
I... I meant it.

263
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,471
Yeah, that's why we love you.

264
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:56,391
So you ready for your life to change?

265
00:16:58,602 --> 00:17:01,188
...Including the jewel in Vought's crown,

266
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:04,816
the greatest superhero team
the world's ever seen:

267
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,610
The Seven.

268
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:09,404
That is our job, our honour.

269
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:10,739
We are Vought.

270
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:13,366
We make heroes super.

271
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:22,292
I have a very exciting surprise for you.

272
00:17:23,335 --> 00:17:25,629
Both a member of the Seven,

273
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:28,632
and Lord of the Seven Seas,

274
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:31,259
live and in person, the Deep.

275
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:47,984
Thank you.

276
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,948
Thank you, everybody.

277
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:57,035
After a long...

278
00:17:57,118 --> 00:18:00,455
distinguished career with the Seven...

279
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:04,292
my good friend, the Lamplighter, has retired.

280
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:08,713
Let's give him a big "thank you." What do you say?

281
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:10,465
Thank you, Lamplighter!

282
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:14,344
But now...

283
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:18,348
as we turn towards the future...

284
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:22,394
I'd like to introduce someone very special.

285
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:25,272
And I, for one, can't wait to work with her.

286
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:28,275
Please welcome Starlight.

287
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:29,859
Go. Go. That's you.

288
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:43,039
- Ooh, look at that.
- Ladies and gentlemen,

289
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:45,208
Starlight and the Deep.

290
00:18:51,423 --> 00:18:52,590
Hi.

291
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:54,426
I love you, Starlight!

292
00:18:57,012 --> 00:18:58,096
We love you!

293
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:42,891
Hey, buddy, you okay?

294
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:48,730
Hey, buddy!

295
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:05,497
Wow.

296
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:10,668
Pretty cool, huh? Oh, hey, check this out.

297
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:14,923
We have two World View-4 satellites
in geocentric orbit.

298
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:18,968
We can essentially read
a getaway car's licence plate from 380 miles up.

299
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:21,429
That is just...

300
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:23,056
I mean...

301
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:26,810
I was working with a police scanner
that I bought on eBay.

302
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:29,396
Yeah, well, not anymore you're not.

303
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:32,524
Oh, and wait until you
check out the dining room.

304
00:20:32,607 --> 00:20:36,903
We may or may not have stolen Miro
from Gramercy Tavern.

305
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:39,823
Yeah, he's fan-fucking-tastic.

306
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:43,410
That's his, isn't it?

307
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:45,954
Homelander's? Yeah.

308
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:48,289
But you'll have your own soon.

309
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:50,667
Here. Come on. Give it a test drive.

310
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,628
Come on.

311
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:55,755
Oh, you... You okay?

312
00:20:56,631 --> 00:20:58,174
It's just...

313
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,556
I used to stand in the mirror,

314
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:08,518
pretending to be where I am right now.

315
00:21:09,644 --> 00:21:10,979
You know something?

316
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:14,524
On my first day, I...

317
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:18,153
Well, I... I felt like a fraud.

318
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:22,615
Yeah. But the good news is,
everybody feels that way.

319
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:26,786
Thank you.

320
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:32,500
And, hey, we're a team now.

321
00:21:32,584 --> 00:21:34,669
We'll help each other out.

322
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:38,673
I bet growing up you had
a poster of Homelander on your wall, huh?

323
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:42,552
No, actually, I...

324
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:45,763
I don't know, Homelander's so...

325
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:48,600
He's like Jesus or something.

326
00:21:49,851 --> 00:21:52,645
If you want to know the truth...

327
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:54,772
I actually had a poster of you.

328
00:21:54,856 --> 00:21:56,941
Really?

329
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:59,277
Yeah. Yeah. I kind of...

330
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,739
I kind of had a schoolgirl crush on you.

331
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:05,158
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

332
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:07,702
I hope that's not inappropriate to say.

333
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:12,457
No, no, no, no, no. It's not inappropriate at all.
It's just, it's kind of wild.

334
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:21,758
What?

335
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:24,719
I mean, you said you had a crush on me.
I figured that, you know...

336
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:26,846
- That is...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.

337
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,264
Look, you're gorgeous.

338
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:32,101
I'm not... I'm not talking about sex,
just a little bit of pole-smoking.

339
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:34,354
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

340
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:37,982
It's just a question of how bad
you want to be in the Seven.

341
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:48,034
Excuse me?

342
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:50,495
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

343
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:53,665
Take it easy.

344
00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:57,043
Settle down. We're just... We're just talking.

345
00:22:57,126 --> 00:23:02,382
And look, I know that you're powerful.
I get it. Your powers are no joke.

346
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,134
The thing is...

347
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:07,345
I am number two around here.

348
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:11,015
So, like, if I say so,
you know, you'd be out of here.

349
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:14,811
Especially since you attacked me.

350
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:16,104
I what?

351
00:23:16,187 --> 00:23:18,565
Yeah. Look.

352
00:23:19,524 --> 00:23:22,694
I mean, Iowa's sweetheart,
the Defender of Des Moines,

353
00:23:22,777 --> 00:23:25,321
just went psycho on the Deep.

354
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:28,032
I mean, that...

355
00:23:28,116 --> 00:23:29,784
that could put you out of the business.

356
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:32,328
Yeah.

357
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:35,665
I mean, home to Mommy,
tail tucked between your legs.

358
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:37,500
Just think of all those kids.

359
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:39,627
I mean, the kids.

360
00:23:39,711 --> 00:23:41,713
Those kids who look up to you,

361
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:44,465
they'd just be shattered.

362
00:23:46,301 --> 00:23:50,096
I mean, that's not what you really want, right?

363
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:53,308
Or we come together as a team.

364
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:57,186
You and me, we just roll with the punches,

365
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:59,981
for, like, three minutes, maybe.

366
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:01,983
It's not a big deal.

367
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,445
And then you know what happens?

368
00:24:05,528 --> 00:24:07,780
All your dreams come true.

369
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:16,581
I'm sure you guys have all heard
that Translucent stopped a home invasion

370
00:24:16,664 --> 00:24:18,666
in Yonkers last night, a young, single mother

371
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,501
and her two kids.

372
00:24:20,585 --> 00:24:22,754
Just incredible. Just...

373
00:24:22,837 --> 00:24:25,757
So tell us, how are you able to vanish?

374
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,216
No, I don't actually vanish.

375
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:32,513
My skin turns into this carbon meta-material
that bends the light.

376
00:24:32,597 --> 00:24:34,223
Like an invisibility cloak.

377
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:38,061
All right, but just to be clear,
you have to be completely naked, right?

378
00:24:39,896 --> 00:24:42,482
I appreciate you coming on the show, my man.
I love you.

379
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:44,525
Stay tuned for a behind-the-scenes look

380
00:24:44,609 --> 00:24:46,944
at Invisible Force 2,
and later, Translucent himself...

381
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:53,368
You interested in a nanny cam?
Because we're actually running a special on that.

382
00:24:53,451 --> 00:24:55,953
It's a pretty popular bear.
There's cameras in the eyes.

383
00:24:56,037 --> 00:25:00,041
Tell me,
how many nannies shake their babies?

384
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:02,502
I'm sorry?

385
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:07,006
You know, a good, hard shake, like...

386
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:10,510
like trying to get ketchup out of a bottle.

387
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:12,470
One percent? Less?

388
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:14,430
I... I don't really know.

389
00:25:14,514 --> 00:25:16,557
Funny, that.

390
00:25:16,641 --> 00:25:20,019
They sell a billion dollars' worth
of that shit worldwide.

391
00:25:20,103 --> 00:25:22,271
Goes to show you, doesn't it?

392
00:25:22,355 --> 00:25:26,776
The bollocks people will believe
if you get them scared enough.

393
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:30,488
Cool.

394
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:33,199
Cool, cool.

395
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:35,743
Is there anything I can
help you with today, or...?

396
00:25:35,827 --> 00:25:38,454
I'm not gonna piss you about, Hughie.

397
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:40,873
I heard what happened to Robin.

398
00:25:40,957 --> 00:25:43,418
- I'm... I'm sorry, who are you?
- She wasn't in the street.

399
00:25:43,501 --> 00:25:45,253
She was one step off the fucking curb.

400
00:25:45,336 --> 00:25:48,589
- And you didn't take the pay-off.
- Yeah. I said, who the hell are you?

401
00:25:48,673 --> 00:25:51,634
- How do you know that?
- Name's Butcher.

402
00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:53,261
Billy Butcher.

403
00:25:55,138 --> 00:26:00,268
Listen, I was thinking that
you and me should have a little bit of a chat.

404
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,689
You're a fed?

405
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:06,274
You don't sound like a fed.

406
00:26:06,357 --> 00:26:07,400
What, I can't immigrate?

407
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:10,737
There's a giant green slapper
with her ass in the harbour that says different.

408
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,781
- You don't really look like one, either.
- No? What do I look like?

409
00:26:13,865 --> 00:26:17,076
Like you're starring in a porn version
of The Matrix.

410
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,120
Well, it's all right there in black and white.

411
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:21,998
Okay. What exactly can I do for you?

412
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:25,710
No, you got it all wrong, Hughie.
It's what I can do for you.

413
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:27,587
You see, you ain't alone, son.

414
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:29,338
It happens a lot more than you think.

415
00:26:29,422 --> 00:26:33,176
Supes lose hundreds of people each year
to collateral damage.

416
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:36,679
No. Come on, that'd be all over the news.
People would be screaming bloody murder.

417
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:40,099
Yeah, look, there might be the odd mention of it
now and again, like with Robin,

418
00:26:40,183 --> 00:26:44,645
but there's a fuck-sight more that happens
that just gets swept right under the rug.

419
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:46,105
Why?

420
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:50,568
Ain't it obvious?

421
00:26:50,651 --> 00:26:55,364
Movie tickets, merchandising,
theme parks, video games.

422
00:26:55,448 --> 00:27:00,119
A multi-billion dollar global industry
supported by corporate lobbyists

423
00:27:00,203 --> 00:27:02,914
and politicians on both sides.

424
00:27:02,997 --> 00:27:06,459
But the main reason
that you won't hear about it

425
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:09,337
is because the public
don't want to know about it.

426
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:13,007
See, people love that cosy feeling
that Supes give them.

427
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:17,136
Some golden cunt
to swoop out of the sky and save the day

428
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,722
so you don't got to do it yourself.

429
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:23,184
But if you knew half the shit they get up to...

430
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:27,563
Fucking diabolical.

431
00:27:27,647 --> 00:27:31,734
But then... that's where I come in.

432
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:34,612
Come in to... To do what?

433
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:38,157
Spank the bastards when they get out of line.

434
00:27:38,783 --> 00:27:40,409
How do you spank a Supe?

435
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,495
Come on, son.

436
00:27:43,371 --> 00:27:44,872
Where?

437
00:27:44,956 --> 00:27:46,249
You'll love it.

438
00:27:46,332 --> 00:27:50,878
Not likely.
Listen, I think this is good. I'm good.

439
00:27:50,962 --> 00:27:53,881
Thank you for
an extremely weird conversation,

440
00:27:53,965 --> 00:27:56,759
but I don't want to go
to a second location with you.

441
00:27:56,843 --> 00:27:58,970
So, I'm gonna get back to work.

442
00:27:59,053 --> 00:28:00,429
Thank you.

443
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:03,683
Hughie! Hughie.

444
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:09,063
This is your one and only, mate.

445
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:11,524
Once I go, I'm gone.

446
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:17,113
I'm offering you the opportunity
to get them that got your girl.

447
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:25,037
What have you got to lose
that you ain't already lost?

448
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:47,310
Where are we?

449
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:49,061
Keep your mouth shut.

450
00:28:51,689 --> 00:28:56,235
Harry. Got your message.
Thank you for being an upstanding citizen.

451
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:58,738
You know this is fucking police brutality, man.

452
00:28:58,821 --> 00:29:02,366
You know what they'll do to me,
they catch me letting you in?

453
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:05,328
Not half of what I'll do if you don't.

454
00:29:07,163 --> 00:29:10,499
Did he just say you were police?

455
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:14,045
Yeah, you know, cop, fed,
all the same to twats like that.

456
00:29:25,723 --> 00:29:27,266
Holy shit.

457
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:30,853
Pick your jaw up off the
floor and try to blend in.

458
00:29:31,854 --> 00:29:36,233
This is the only place where the Supes
can scratch their filthy little itch

459
00:29:36,317 --> 00:29:38,361
without the paps taking snaps.

460
00:29:42,823 --> 00:29:44,450
Wait, wait, wait. That's Ezekiel.

461
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:50,373
The "Capes for Christ" guy...

462
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:54,585
preaches all that "pray the gay away" shit.

463
00:29:54,669 --> 00:29:57,088
And now he's the meat in the Manwich.

464
00:29:57,171 --> 00:29:59,048
Fucking hypocrite.

465
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:07,682
Keep going forward.

466
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:11,394
That's it. Further.

467
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:12,979
Further.

468
00:30:13,062 --> 00:30:14,939
There. There. Stop.

469
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:18,609
Wait, wait, wait.
A-Train's... A-Train's here right now?

470
00:30:18,693 --> 00:30:20,987
Was. This is from last night.

471
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:23,406
Turn it up.

472
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:25,908
I cannot believe you ran through a bitch.

473
00:30:25,992 --> 00:30:29,161
You want to hear something crazy?

474
00:30:29,245 --> 00:30:34,083
I ran so fast through this bitch
that I swallowed one of her molars.

475
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:37,420
Like a bug on the fucking freeway.

476
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:39,547
Dude, that's nasty.

477
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:44,468
They're laughing.

478
00:30:44,552 --> 00:30:47,763
Just... Like she's a joke.

479
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:51,350
They're fucking laughing.

480
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:01,110
So, what are you gonna do about it?

481
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:41,317
Oh, for Chrissakes.

482
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,944
Clean yourself up.

483
00:31:44,028 --> 00:31:46,864
Never let them see you like this.

484
00:31:49,742 --> 00:31:52,745
Translucent, you're a goddamn pervert.

485
00:32:01,128 --> 00:32:02,713
I'll just go.

486
00:32:05,216 --> 00:32:06,759
They're all like that?

487
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:10,721
All of them? Even Homelander?

488
00:32:10,805 --> 00:32:12,640
Homelander's the exception.

489
00:32:12,723 --> 00:32:15,059
He doesn't drink, doesn't smoke.

490
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:17,186
Man's a saint.

491
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:18,896
But the rest of them, yeah.

492
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:21,607
Pardon my French, fuck those fuckers.

493
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:25,027
Here. Have a shufti of that.

494
00:32:25,111 --> 00:32:26,362
What are these?

495
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:29,782
That's the police log
the day that Robin got murdered.

496
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:33,369
Couple of bar fights. A few cars got nicked.

497
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:35,871
But you know what's not in there?

498
00:32:35,955 --> 00:32:38,124
No bank alarms going off.

499
00:32:38,207 --> 00:32:40,793
No one charged at Central Booking.

500
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:45,673
A-Train stopped two bank robbers, my arse.
Someone's fucking hiding something.

501
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:47,007
Hiding what?

502
00:32:47,091 --> 00:32:50,052
Well, I don't know,
whatever dodgy shit he was up to that night.

503
00:32:50,136 --> 00:32:53,013
Why couldn't he stop?
I mean, what was in that bag?

504
00:32:53,097 --> 00:32:55,141
You know? Who was he running from?

505
00:32:55,224 --> 00:32:57,685
- Or where was he running to?
- Bingo.

506
00:32:57,768 --> 00:33:01,564
Work that out, and we'll have the fucker,
I can smell it.

507
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:03,440
Okay.

508
00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:06,944
Okay, so...

509
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:08,529
what can I do to help?

510
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,157
Here's what you do.

511
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,326
Ring Vought, tell them you'll take the money,
sign the NDA,

512
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:16,996
but only if A-Train's there
in person when you do it.

513
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:20,166
- Why does A-Train need to be there?
- They'll take you into the Seven Tower,

514
00:33:20,291 --> 00:33:22,877
- through security, mate, and then you'll plant a bug.
- A bug?

515
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,671
A bug. And we'll have a little listen.

516
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:27,464
See what's really going on.

517
00:33:27,548 --> 00:33:29,925
Okay, let me just...
Sorry, let me just get this straight.

518
00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:33,512
You want me to...
You want me to go to Seven Tower by myself,

519
00:33:33,596 --> 00:33:38,517
and... And you want me to plant a bug,
like I'm... What, like I'm fucking James Bond?

520
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:41,145
- Yeah, exactly. You got it.
- You're FBI.

521
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:44,356
If you're FBI, then get a warrant.
Why do you... Why do you even need me?

522
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,985
Hughie, Hughie, look, mate,
I got a warrant, all right?

523
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:52,489
But that place is firewalled, untappable,
and locked up tighter than a nun's knickers.

524
00:33:52,573 --> 00:33:55,951
I couldn't get myself in there in a million years.
But you, son, you could do it.

525
00:33:56,035 --> 00:33:57,745
- No, no, I can't, okay?
- Yeah.

526
00:33:57,828 --> 00:34:00,164
I can't. No. You didn't see A-Train covered in...

527
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:04,919
And I'm, what, I'm just supposed to go in there,
and I'm supposed to shake his hand?

528
00:34:05,002 --> 00:34:06,462
- And smile?
- Yeah.

529
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:08,881
I'm not...
Do you know who my favourite musician is?

530
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:10,966
- Who?
- James Taylor.

531
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:13,886
Number two, Simon & Garfunkel.
Number three, Billy Joel.

532
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:16,972
Any of those guys, they don't infiltrate.

533
00:34:17,056 --> 00:34:20,100
- Okay? I'm not an infiltrator.
- Hughie, Hughie, fucking grow a pair.

534
00:34:20,184 --> 00:34:23,646
- You heard that cunt laughing at your girl.
- No. No. No.

535
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:26,440
No, I can't. I can't do that.

536
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:29,985
I'm sorry, I'm just gonna fuck it up,
and you're not gonna have your bug...

537
00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:32,696
...and I'll be dead.

538
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:35,324
I'm not... I'm not like you.

539
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:43,457
This is amazing, Madelyn.

540
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,751
Thank you for this. My kid is gonna lose his mind.

541
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:48,087
It is our pleasure.

542
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:49,838
Just do not sell it online.

543
00:34:51,632 --> 00:34:53,592
All right. What are you thinking?

544
00:34:53,676 --> 00:34:58,097
Baltimore is a beautiful town,
but you've got a problem.

545
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:02,017
Your homicide rates are up, what, 62 percent?

546
00:35:02,101 --> 00:35:05,646
The police are not closing cases.
You're on the verge of needing a federal lifeline.

547
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:08,023
Cut to the chase, Madelyn.

548
00:35:08,107 --> 00:35:10,276
Who are you proposing?

549
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:12,361
Nubian Prince.

550
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:15,739
Fits your population's demo, but not too militant.

551
00:35:15,823 --> 00:35:20,077
Caucasians love him, too,
with a 59 percent approval rate.

552
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:25,082
I am willing to give you
a three-year exclusive contract

553
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:26,583
with full PR support,

554
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:31,130
and I'm gonna give you nine and a half points
of the merchandising.

555
00:35:31,213 --> 00:35:32,965
I thought he was in Detroit.

556
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:35,134
Well, we're thinking about making a move.

557
00:35:35,217 --> 00:35:36,927
How much?

558
00:35:37,011 --> 00:35:39,471
$300 million a year.

559
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:45,602
I know, I know, it's a tough swallow.

560
00:35:45,686 --> 00:35:49,356
But we both know that your city needs a hero.

561
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:53,485
$200 million for Nubian Prince.

562
00:35:53,569 --> 00:35:56,113
I can sell that.

563
00:35:56,196 --> 00:35:58,615
I'm sorry, Steve, I can't do it.

564
00:35:58,699 --> 00:36:01,035
We've got Atlanta waiting in the wings.

565
00:36:01,118 --> 00:36:03,620
I think maybe you can.

566
00:36:03,704 --> 00:36:05,289
And why is that?

567
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,754
I happen to know about Compound V.

568
00:36:14,423 --> 00:36:16,550
What is Compound V?

569
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:20,429
It's the type of rumour that could
really tarnish those heroes of yours.

570
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:21,805
Nobody wants that.

571
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:23,223
People need heroes.

572
00:36:23,307 --> 00:36:26,018
Now, I can make sure
that that stays a rumour,

573
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:28,020
because I'm a friend.

574
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:31,774
But friendship does cut both ways.

575
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:35,611
I'm sorry, Steve,
I don't know what you're talking about.

576
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:38,655
$300 million is the price...

577
00:36:38,739 --> 00:36:41,158
or we go to Atlanta.

578
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,536
So, how amazing is it?

579
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,080
What's Homelander like?

580
00:36:46,163 --> 00:36:48,165
He's busy.

581
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:51,627
I haven't really met him yet, but...

582
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:56,340
- Mom, I got to tell you what happened.
- Oh, I forgot.

583
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:58,384
I was playing mah-jongg with Patty and Trish,

584
00:36:58,467 --> 00:37:01,887
and Patty is going on and on
about how her daughter got into med school,

585
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,639
and I'm thinking, so what?

586
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:06,100
My daughter got into the Seven!

587
00:37:06,183 --> 00:37:09,144
Anyway, so, what did you want to tell me?

588
00:37:11,105 --> 00:37:13,524
Everything's great.

589
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:15,526
Just how we dreamed.

590
00:37:17,027 --> 00:37:19,571
Mom, actually, you know what? I have to go.

591
00:37:19,655 --> 00:37:21,573
All right. Bye, honey.

592
00:37:44,555 --> 00:37:45,889
Excuse me.

593
00:37:45,973 --> 00:37:47,641
I'm sorry, are you okay?

594
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:50,227
Just seemed like a...

595
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:51,645
tough call.

596
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,898
- Sorry. I don't mean to bother you.
- No, no, it's okay.

597
00:37:56,567 --> 00:37:59,027
I'm fine. I'm just...

598
00:37:59,111 --> 00:38:01,155
I'm just having a bad day.

599
00:38:01,238 --> 00:38:04,158
Yeah, me too.

600
00:38:04,241 --> 00:38:08,036
Is it, like, a work thing, or...

601
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,997
a life thing?

602
00:38:11,165 --> 00:38:13,417
It's a work thing.

603
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:15,836
You?

604
00:38:17,713 --> 00:38:19,631
Life thing.

605
00:38:21,675 --> 00:38:25,637
You know how you have this...

606
00:38:25,721 --> 00:38:28,182
image of yourself?

607
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:31,727
Like, I thought I was strong.

608
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:34,104
You know? Like, made of steel.

609
00:38:34,188 --> 00:38:35,105
A fighter.

610
00:38:35,189 --> 00:38:36,356
And...

611
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:41,361
then I was faced with this horrible situation
with this asshole...

612
00:38:42,196 --> 00:38:44,156
and...

613
00:38:45,157 --> 00:38:48,702
I just heard my mom's voice in my head,

614
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:52,915
"Keep smiling, the show must go on,"

615
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:56,084
and... I didn't fight.

616
00:38:56,168 --> 00:38:59,838
And now I just feel sick.

617
00:38:59,922 --> 00:39:02,966
Partly because I did it, but...

618
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:05,677
mostly because...

619
00:39:06,929 --> 00:39:11,183
turns out I'm not who I thought I was.

620
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:18,190
Oh, I'm sorry.

621
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:24,738
- I... I didn't mean to just dump all of that onto you.
- No, no, it's totally fine that you dumped.

622
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:30,953
Listen, do you like your job?

623
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:34,456
It's the only thing I've ever wanted.

624
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,375
And it's a good job?

625
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:39,211
Like, you're not selling kids smack?

626
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:41,713
No, it's a great job.

627
00:39:41,797 --> 00:39:44,258
I could help a lot of people.

628
00:39:45,092 --> 00:39:47,094
Thing is, I...

629
00:39:47,803 --> 00:39:50,347
used to know this girl...

630
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:54,393
and we used to go skating at Rockefeller,

631
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:58,021
and I'd be on the side
with this death grip on the rails.

632
00:39:58,105 --> 00:40:01,608
She would just charge headfirst
into the middle of the rink.

633
00:40:01,692 --> 00:40:04,319
And she wasn't... good.

634
00:40:04,403 --> 00:40:06,613
Like, she fell...

635
00:40:06,697 --> 00:40:08,574
a lot...

636
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:11,201
but she was never scared.

637
00:40:15,622 --> 00:40:18,166
And she always used to say:

638
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:22,379
"Just because you fall on your ass
doesn't mean you have to stay there."

639
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:25,382
So you fell on your ass, you know?

640
00:40:26,425 --> 00:40:28,510
That's not who you are.

641
00:40:30,596 --> 00:40:32,347
So who are you?

642
00:40:38,145 --> 00:40:40,147
I'm a fighter.

643
00:40:41,982 --> 00:40:43,567
I'm gonna fight.

644
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:46,403
Yeah.

645
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:51,116
I'm gonna take that son of a bitch's head
clean off his body.

646
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:53,285
Okay. Wow, that was...

647
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:54,995
Okay.

648
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:57,039
Cool.

649
00:40:57,122 --> 00:40:58,332
Little scary, but...

650
00:40:58,415 --> 00:41:00,417
but cool.

651
00:41:02,544 --> 00:41:04,796
I'm... I'm Hughie, by the way.

652
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,590
Annie.

653
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:24,775
Okay, man. I'm in.

654
00:41:28,487 --> 00:41:32,199
Okay, it's ringing.

655
00:41:32,741 --> 00:41:34,076
Yeah, hello?

656
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:36,995
Hi. Hi. Yes, hello. Hello, Mr. Friedman.

657
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:38,997
It's Hughie Campbell. I got your message,

658
00:41:39,081 --> 00:41:44,002
and $45K, it's just...
it's just... it's bingo, like, life-changing.

659
00:41:44,086 --> 00:41:48,048
But I just need one thing
before I sign anything.

660
00:41:48,131 --> 00:41:52,094
- I need an apology from A-Train.
- He already apologised.

661
00:41:52,177 --> 00:41:53,762
Well, no, no, no.

662
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:55,389
No, he hasn't. Yes, he sent his...

663
00:41:55,472 --> 00:42:00,811
He sent his regrets and his sympathies on...
on TV, but I...

664
00:42:00,894 --> 00:42:06,149
if I could just get an apology face-to-face,
that would be fantastic.

665
00:42:06,233 --> 00:42:07,859
Just to... Just for closure,

666
00:42:07,943 --> 00:42:09,945
just to put... Just to put a b-button on it.

667
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:11,947
Okay, yeah. But...

668
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:14,074
Hugh, I'm telling you, the answer's gonna be no.

669
00:42:14,157 --> 00:42:17,285
All right, in that case,
can you just give me... Hello?

670
00:42:17,369 --> 00:42:21,039
I think... They hung up.
I don't think they're gonna go for it.

671
00:42:21,123 --> 00:42:25,001
Oh, yes, they will.

672
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:43,353
Starlight.

673
00:42:43,437 --> 00:42:46,732
Don't want to be late to
your first official meeting.

674
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:50,277
I had a whole welcome speech planned.

675
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,778
Sorry, sir.

676
00:42:51,862 --> 00:42:53,572
Please, Homelander's fine.

677
00:42:53,655 --> 00:42:56,533
Beginning to wonder if you'd even show up.

678
00:42:56,616 --> 00:43:00,370
I mean, all that pressure,
it's a lot for anyone to swallow.

679
00:43:00,454 --> 00:43:03,498
Yeah. Don't worry, I'll be fine.

680
00:43:03,582 --> 00:43:05,167
I'm here...

681
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:08,003
and I'm not going anywhere.

682
00:43:10,714 --> 00:43:14,259
Can we get back to this, please?
This is a serious crime.

683
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:17,971
These assholes pirated my movie
three weeks before release,

684
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:19,556
and you can't walk down 5th Avenue

685
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:22,601
without bumping into a table
of unlicensed Homelander shirts.

686
00:43:22,684 --> 00:43:26,813
Copyright infringement is costing Vought
$1 .2 billion per year.

687
00:43:26,897 --> 00:43:28,523
That's money out of our pockets.

688
00:43:28,607 --> 00:43:30,358
We've all got, what, four points each?

689
00:43:30,442 --> 00:43:32,068
What the fuck?

690
00:43:32,152 --> 00:43:34,571
You got four points?

691
00:43:34,863 --> 00:43:36,490
And clearly better lawyers.

692
00:43:36,573 --> 00:43:39,242
Hey, hey, hey, guys, come on.

693
00:43:39,326 --> 00:43:40,619
Stop.

694
00:43:40,702 --> 00:43:42,454
What's Starlight gonna think?

695
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:45,457
Listening to us haggling over nickels.

696
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:48,585
We're the Seven, for God's sake.

697
00:43:48,668 --> 00:43:51,671
Whether we're out there or we're in here.

698
00:43:51,755 --> 00:43:54,007
Now, what I do want to hear...

699
00:43:54,716 --> 00:43:57,344
is who you saved this week.

700
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:00,305
Who's up for that?

701
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:04,476
Black Noir.

702
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:05,894
Let's start with you, man.

703
00:44:12,526 --> 00:44:13,819
Do you have a dog?

704
00:44:13,902 --> 00:44:15,487
No.

705
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,364
All right, give us your phone.

706
00:44:17,447 --> 00:44:19,574
There's fuck-all security to worry about.

707
00:44:19,658 --> 00:44:21,409
In fact, they're a bunch of muppets.

708
00:44:21,493 --> 00:44:24,079
And the metal detector won't pick this up. Right?

709
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:26,706
And what they'll probably do
is take you through the security

710
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:28,124
and then up into the boardroom.

711
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:31,127
Sit down. Be nice, congenial.

712
00:44:31,211 --> 00:44:34,089
Then, real polite-like, tell them
you're gonna take a fat shit.

713
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:38,468
Go into the bog, take the bug out. Peel back
the plastic bit to reveal the sticky side.

714
00:44:38,552 --> 00:44:41,596
Put the plastic bit in the bog. Flush it.

715
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:45,976
Then go back into the boardroom,
sit down, big smiles,

716
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:48,144
plant the bug underneath the table.

717
00:44:48,228 --> 00:44:49,813
Easy-peasy Japanese-y.

718
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:52,065
Bob's your uncle. That's that.

719
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:53,400
- That's that?
- Yeah.

720
00:44:53,483 --> 00:44:56,903
That was... That was a lot. I've...
Hold on, can you just... Can you repeat it again?

721
00:44:56,987 --> 00:45:00,031
- Just a little bit slower? Because I...
- Listen.

722
00:45:00,115 --> 00:45:02,659
Fuck. Hughie, calm down, all right?

723
00:45:02,742 --> 00:45:05,996
This is like that scene in The Matrix.

724
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:08,915
Now, you could take the fucking red pill, right?

725
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:15,338
Spend the rest of your life jacking off, crying
into your chai tea green latte, what the fuck.

726
00:45:15,422 --> 00:45:18,925
Or you could take the blue pill.

727
00:45:19,009 --> 00:45:22,512
Or is it the red pill?
Anyway, take the other pill and quit being a cunt.

728
00:45:22,596 --> 00:45:26,683
- Which pill do you want me to take?
- Just quit being a cunt. That's what I'm saying.

729
00:45:27,893 --> 00:45:29,561
Fuck me. Okay.

730
00:46:13,563 --> 00:46:16,358
Sir, could you empty your pockets, please?

731
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:46,137
Thank you.

732
00:47:14,791 --> 00:47:17,377
Excuse me, can I...

733
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:19,629
can I use your bathroom?

734
00:47:20,797 --> 00:47:22,590
Just to be clear, A-Train's apology

735
00:47:22,674 --> 00:47:25,301
isn't an admission of any sort
of culpability whatsoever.

736
00:47:25,385 --> 00:47:28,346
Do you understand?

737
00:47:31,182 --> 00:47:34,144
I'm sorry about what happened
to your girlfriend, all right?

738
00:47:37,981 --> 00:47:39,774
Hey, dude, are you okay?

739
00:47:52,328 --> 00:47:53,246
Fine.

740
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:57,542
I appreciate the apology.

741
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:59,878
Accidents happen, right?

742
00:47:59,961 --> 00:48:03,173
After all, I mean,
you were saving the world.

743
00:48:03,256 --> 00:48:06,593
Okay, great. Thank you so much.
As you know, a crimefighter's work is never done.

744
00:48:06,718 --> 00:48:10,430
Douglas here will handle the rest of the paperwork
for you, okay? Thank you.

745
00:48:10,513 --> 00:48:12,599
I told you, you have to be better.

746
00:48:15,477 --> 00:48:17,103
Can I use your bathroom?

747
00:49:12,075 --> 00:49:14,494
What the fuck?

748
00:49:31,594 --> 00:49:34,264
And I look him right in the eye, and I smile.

749
00:49:34,347 --> 00:49:38,226
And that was awesome, man,
just getting to stare that asshole down.

750
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:40,103
I get why you dig this job.

751
00:49:40,186 --> 00:49:42,647
Yeah, you know,
it has its moments, doesn't it?

752
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:45,733
You were right. Fuck A-Train.

753
00:49:45,817 --> 00:49:48,945
Fuck A-Train. Fuck... Fuck the Seven.

754
00:49:49,028 --> 00:49:52,740
Fuck all... Seven.

755
00:49:52,824 --> 00:49:54,659
What are we...?

756
00:49:54,742 --> 00:49:56,703
What are we doing here?

757
00:49:56,786 --> 00:49:59,706
Well, you got to go to work, don't you?

758
00:49:59,789 --> 00:50:03,293
Yeah, but I don't...

759
00:50:03,376 --> 00:50:07,338
Well, I mean,
that's all I need you for right now, Hughie.

760
00:50:08,548 --> 00:50:10,175
Yeah, I mean, but I can...

761
00:50:10,258 --> 00:50:13,720
I can help with other stuff, you know?
I could... I could be, like, your tech guy.

762
00:50:13,845 --> 00:50:18,516
You know? Like, I could be in the van with the thing
and, like, you know, "He's down the hall to the left."

763
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,768
- Like, I can...
- Yeah, look, son, I...

764
00:50:20,852 --> 00:50:23,563
I think it's best that I take it from here.
You know what I mean?

765
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:26,024
Yeah, but I can... I can really help.

766
00:50:26,107 --> 00:50:28,985
I know you can help, but I got it.

767
00:50:41,206 --> 00:50:43,124
Oh, w... Oh, hey, wait.

768
00:50:45,126 --> 00:50:48,463
You ever see an asshole tear up $45K?

769
00:50:51,633 --> 00:50:53,301
Hughie.

770
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:57,472
You're a good lad.

771
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:16,074
Ms. Stillwell, I wasn't sure you'd call.

772
00:51:16,157 --> 00:51:19,035
This fucking chafes, but...

773
00:51:19,118 --> 00:51:22,580
I'm willing to come down
to $230 million for Nubian Prince.

774
00:51:22,664 --> 00:51:25,166
That's very reasonable, Maddie. Thank you.

775
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:28,711
And, Steve, this Compound V...

776
00:51:28,795 --> 00:51:32,382
any rumours you may have heard
about my heroes...

777
00:51:32,465 --> 00:51:35,176
libellous and completely untrue.

778
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:40,515
But we all know how rumours spread,
so... I'd appreciate your discretion.

779
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:41,599
Of course.

780
00:51:41,683 --> 00:51:43,184
You have my word.

781
00:51:43,268 --> 00:51:44,852
Thank you.

782
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:47,480
Have a safe flight home.

783
00:51:50,233 --> 00:51:55,947
Policing cities is a thorny enough issue as it is,
but allowing superheroes into national defence?

784
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:58,491
We'd basically be privatizing war.

785
00:52:00,285 --> 00:52:02,120
Good night, Hughie.

786
00:52:02,203 --> 00:52:03,913
You'll lock up?

787
00:52:03,997 --> 00:52:05,123
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

788
00:52:05,206 --> 00:52:06,791
Thanks, Gary.

789
00:52:18,761 --> 00:52:20,930
Sorry, we're closing up.

790
00:52:28,146 --> 00:52:29,272
Hello?

791
00:52:31,816 --> 00:52:33,276
Who are you?

792
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:34,527
The fuck?

793
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:37,113
Right in front of you, prick.

794
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,826
You think I wouldn't find this thing?

795
00:52:46,539 --> 00:52:48,207
Hughie.

796
00:52:51,878 --> 00:52:54,380
You pussy, I followed you from the fucking Tower.

797
00:52:54,464 --> 00:52:56,841
No, no, no!

798
00:52:59,844 --> 00:53:02,263
Who's that guy you were with, in the car?

799
00:53:02,347 --> 00:53:03,639
- Who was he?
- I don't...

800
00:53:03,723 --> 00:53:05,308
- He put you up to this?
- I don't know!

801
00:53:05,391 --> 00:53:08,895
- He was just some Uber driver, okay?
- Don't give me some bullshit! Uber driver!

802
00:53:08,978 --> 00:53:11,189
Do you think I'm a fucking idiot?

803
00:53:11,939 --> 00:53:14,901
- Why'd you plant the bug?
- Please.

804
00:53:14,984 --> 00:53:17,362
Please, please, please. No, please.

805
00:53:17,445 --> 00:53:18,946
We're the Seven,

806
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:20,907
Earth's most mighty,

807
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:23,826
champions of the innocent,

808
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:25,703
motherfucker!

809
00:53:33,378 --> 00:53:35,963
Sorry about the mess.

810
00:53:38,174 --> 00:53:39,967
You should fuck off, Hughie.

811
00:53:45,723 --> 00:53:48,184
Hughie, run!

812
00:53:48,851 --> 00:53:51,062
Well, well, well,

813
00:53:51,187 --> 00:53:53,856
if it ain't the invisible cunt.

814
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:24,429
There you are.

815
00:54:53,124 --> 00:54:55,168
So who are you?

816
00:54:55,251 --> 00:54:56,794
Fucking spy?

817
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:59,380
For who?

818
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,259
You're gonna fucking tell me,

819
00:55:03,342 --> 00:55:06,012
or I'm gonna smash your fucking scalp off!

820
00:55:06,095 --> 00:55:07,889
Who the fuck are you?!

821
00:55:07,972 --> 00:55:09,932
I'll tell you who you are.

822
00:55:10,016 --> 00:55:12,435
A fucking moron.

823
00:55:12,518 --> 00:55:16,397
"Translucent" doesn't even mean "invisible."

824
00:55:16,481 --> 00:55:19,192
It means "semi-transparent."

825
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:46,260
Is he... is he dead?

826
00:55:46,969 --> 00:55:48,304
Is he...?

827
00:55:49,889 --> 00:55:51,474
Well, he ain't moving.

828
00:55:51,557 --> 00:55:55,728
- Oh, fuck. Oh, shit.
- How'd you know the electric would do the job?

829
00:55:55,811 --> 00:55:57,563
Skin's carbon.

830
00:55:57,647 --> 00:55:59,607
Highly conductive.

831
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:02,527
Saw it on Jimmy Fallon.

832
00:56:04,445 --> 00:56:07,281
Would've taken me forever
to work that one out.

833
00:56:07,365 --> 00:56:08,699
Good job.

834
00:56:08,783 --> 00:56:10,034
Let's get him in the boot.

835
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:12,245
Wait, wait, what? Wait, what? What?

836
00:56:12,328 --> 00:56:14,288
The trunk.

837
00:56:14,372 --> 00:56:17,166
No, no, I mean, what are we...?
What are we doing with him?

838
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:19,669
Well, Hughie, you just offed
one of the Seven, mate.

839
00:56:19,752 --> 00:56:21,045
Me? I...

840
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:23,923
You... You hit him with a fucking car!

841
00:56:24,006 --> 00:56:26,300
Look, potato, fucking po-tah-to.

842
00:56:26,384 --> 00:56:28,094
We're both in a shitload of trouble.

843
00:56:28,177 --> 00:56:32,223
No, no, no, we're not! It's... It...
He... He attacked us, okay?

844
00:56:32,306 --> 00:56:37,728
And you're a federal officer, you know?
Just... Just call the fucking FBI.

845
00:56:37,812 --> 00:56:42,066
Yeah. Okay, so, look, technically, I'm not a fed.

846
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:45,570
What?!

847
00:56:46,779 --> 00:56:49,657
Then who the fuck are you?!

848
00:56:59,584 --> 00:57:02,169
Don't worry about it, kiddo.
It's just a little turbulence.

849
00:57:02,253 --> 00:57:03,713
It'll be okay.

850
00:57:21,397 --> 00:57:25,359
Dad. Dad. Dad!

851
00:57:28,279 --> 00:57:30,781
What's he doing out here?

852
00:57:30,865 --> 00:57:32,617
Aren't you guys friends?

853
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:38,456
Oh, my God.
