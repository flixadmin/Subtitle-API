1
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,558
- Hello to you.
- Hello to you.

2
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:15,984
I hope you're fine.

3
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:22,365
<i>Who knows the
electron wave functions</i>

4
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,944
<i>for Kryptonian covalent bonding?</i>

5
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,330
Sorry.

6
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:29,535
Leah.

7
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,412
<i>The cube root
of the wavelength...</i>

8
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,412
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

9
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:37,377
- Hello, Kara.
- Hello to you.

10
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,052
<i>Oh, it is beautiful.</i>

11
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,520
What's that gonna be, Zaltar?

12
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,520
I think... a tree.

13
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,600
A tree.

14
00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:58,690
What is a tree?

15
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,146
A lovely thing
which grows on Earth.

16
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,698
Earth? You mean
where my cousin went?

17
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,821
Hmm, and to where,
one day soon perhaps

18
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,948
I might venture as well.

19
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,747
I don't believe you. How?

20
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:15,120
- In that. Through there.
- The binary chute?

21
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,316
But you'd never survive
the pressure. It'll destroy...

22
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,672
In that I can.
Zip-zap and I'm gone.

23
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,671
But you'd never
leave us, Zaltar.

24
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,504
- <i>You'd never leave Argo City.
- Indeed,</i> I <i>might,</i> Kara.

25
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:26,179
Too much of a good thing here.

26
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:31,010
Perhaps I'll try Saturn instead.
Yes, I think I might.

27
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:34,517
Saturn is... is that
further away than Earth?

28
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:35,733
Silly question.

29
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:38,146
Didn't you study six-dimensional
geometry at school?

30
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,726
Do they not teach
anything anymore?

31
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:43,189
Well, of course they do.
I know the equations.

32
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,944
I just can't see
them in my head.

33
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:53,161
Most great artists find
mathematics troublesome, Kara.

34
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:56,660
- Only use your imagination.
- Mm-hm.

35
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,791
Saturn and Earth
are in outer space

36
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:02,545
but we, we are in inner space.

37
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:05,423
Our city has two great
power sources.

38
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,671
This is one of them. Look.

39
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,471
An omegahedron.

40
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,644
The Guardians let you have it?

41
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:21,068
Not exactly. I borrowed it.

42
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,487
You stole it. Oh, Zaltar,
they're gonna...

43
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:27,692
No, borrowed it...
for the afternoon.

44
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:32,997
- For inspiration.
- Inspiration.

45
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:57,138
But I think that
I shall never see

46
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,268
the branches of a living tree.

47
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:03,022
Why? An omegahedron
can create life, can't it?

48
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:06,856
It can't, child, it can't.
Just the illusion of life.

49
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,282
That's a fancy shadow
of the real thing

50
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:12,282
which is the most we can hope
for on this lonely old rock.

51
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,862
Kara.

52
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,827
Kara, I've been looking
for you for ages.

53
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,078
Oh, I'm sorry, mother.

54
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:20,411
- Zaltar.
- Alura, join us.

55
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,088
We're just inventing miracles.

56
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,293
Put your fingers here,
Kara, and press hard.

57
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:31,221
Good. Now try it.

58
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:35,427
Let your imagination explode
and give it a try. Go on.

59
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,972
Zaltar, my-my husband
tells me you talk

60
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,308
of leaving Argo City.
For where?

61
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,643
Parts unknown.
It is, alas, a fact.

62
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,796
You and Zor-El
have a life here.

63
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,279
<i>You've each other and Kara.</i>

64
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:52,155
<i>But, Zaltar, you
founded this city. It's yours.</i>

65
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,704
As far as the eye can see,
right to the veil, smack

66
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,536
and then what?
What is beyond?

67
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,244
<i>Alura, I cannot contain
myself to Argo City only.</i>

68
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:03,579
<i>My head is boiling with ideas.</i>

69
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,506
<i>My imagination is too vast,
it's uncontrollable.</i>

70
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,210
If you want my opinion, Zaltar,
you're starting to repeat

71
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:13,218
yourself here with
all this airy, glittery stuff.

72
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:17,010
Exactly. That's why
I'm going to Venus.

73
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,554
Venus? When?

74
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:23,808
Tomorrow or the next day,
at the latest.

75
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,147
Zaltar, have you
thought about this <i>?</i>

76
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,195
<i>It doesn't make sense to me.</i>

77
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:32,525
<i>I have thought intensely.
My mind is made up.</i>

78
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,828
Kara! The power source!

79
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:30,591
Oh, Zaltar!
Save me. Please! Help!

80
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,335
- No!
- Kara!

81
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:38,390
Zaltar!
Help! No!

82
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,063
You took the omegahedron.

83
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,406
That's not correct,
I lost the omegahedron.

84
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,317
- No, father, I did...
- Shh, Kara.

85
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,743
No matter who.

86
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,367
Without it this city can't
survive more than a few days.

87
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,746
Our lights will grow dim and
the very air <i>we</i> breathe so thin.

88
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,747
I know. So I shall find it.

89
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,921
I shall go right to the end of
inner space and I'll return it.

90
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:14,001
Impossible. How? No one can
leave Argo City and you know it.

91
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,837
This is our universe and
you've destroyed it with a game.

92
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:20,595
- A childish game.
- I think it can be done.

93
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:25,312
Through there, the binary chute,
in the traveler.

94
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:28,770
<i>Rot-E“ Like a coward you
choose instant destruction</i>

95
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,067
<i>while the rest of us
are doomed to stay here...</i>

96
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:57,215
Kara!

97
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:58,928
Kara, no!

98
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:17,155
- You lunatic!
- She'll be killed.

99
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:18,945
Oh, no, she won't.

100
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,285
She will be safe,
through the binary

101
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:24,579
through the warp,
into another register.

102
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:25,572
Another what?

103
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,453
<i>Gravitational radiation</i>

104
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:31,124
a pathway from inner space
to outer space.

105
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,043
Then she'll never
be the same, ever.

106
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,128
At least she'll be alive.

107
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,382
And my fate is sealed.

108
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:42,180
I've lost the omegahedron

109
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,758
I must be sent
to the Phantom Zone.

110
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:47,553
<i>Your suffering will be short,</i>

111
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:51,227
mine... forever.

112
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,456
Some more
champagne, my dear Selena?

113
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,008
What are you thinking about?

114
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,306
It's such a pretty world.

115
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,937
I can't wait until
it's all mine.

116
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,147
The only way you
can rule the world

117
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:16,726
is to become invisible,
my pumpkin.

118
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:19,065
Invisible?

119
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,073
You'd almost know
how to make me invisible.

120
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,615
Oh, I do know.

121
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:27,866
<i>Take five black beans
and the head of a dead man,</i>

122
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:31,577
place one bean in his mouth,
two beans in his eyes, then...

123
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,617
Nigel, enough.

124
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:37,416
But it works. Then you can
get anywhere, do anything.

125
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:41,091
Nigel, how long have
we been together?

126
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,509
Ooh. Months, darling.

127
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,672
Then why does
it seem like years?

128
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:51,602
Because you're so impatient.
You want everything yesterday.

129
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:54,100
It's a lifetime
to discover the secrets

130
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:57,103
of black magic from
the ancient grimoires.

131
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,941
Holy cow.

132
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,548
I wonder.

133
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:41,485
Immortality be upon this one.

134
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:47,074
She is a sharer
of the sun's everlasting life.

135
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:50,786
There will now
be no danger of death.

136
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:55,574
This world will
keep her forever.

137
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:58,462
What is it?

138
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,087
What's going on?
Hey, what's going on?

139
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,924
I've just outgrown you, Nigel.

140
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:05,717
These things happen.

141
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,378
You can't treat me
like this, Selena.

142
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,888
Without me you'd
still be reading tea leaves

143
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:12,720
at Lake Tahoe.

144
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:21,772
<i>Amsterdam and more. That's
TWA. Never has flying been easier.</i>

145
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:26,484
You can't run out on me, Selena.

146
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,986
I've got the keys, sweetheart.

147
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,972
<i>The president confirmed

<i>Wha-at?</i>

00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:53,352
I have a surprise for you.

161
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,110
<i>They've turned
off the hot water again.</i>

162
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:06,160
I'm really gonna have to kill
somebody down at the DWP.

163
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:08,826
The only way we're gonna
pay our bills next month

164
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,579
in this dump, is to just go
ahead and start our own coven.

165
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:14,578
No longer necessary.

166
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:16,754
I was reading in this book

167
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:18,548
"The Witches Guide
to Heaven and Hell"

168
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,296
if you start your
own coven all you've to do

169
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:23,912
is charge five bucks a head,
minimal admission. That's great.

170
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:26,260
- Chicken feed.
- That's better than goose egg.

171
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,137
What's in the Coffer of Shadow
there? Where's little Nigel?

172
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,560
Nigel, my dear Bianca,
is history.

173
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,012
Oh, yeah? How so?

174
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,725
The water department is history.
The car payments are history.

175
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,526
The mortgage
payments are history.

176
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,854
- How are the property taxes?
- History.

177
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:44,570
The world is at last my oyster.

178
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:52,151
Now, this I like.

179
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:55,826
- Hello.
- "Hello," she says.

180
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,578
- Well, hello to you, honeybun.
- Hello.

181
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:01,328
I was wondering if you could
tell me where I am?

182
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:04,710
What do they call this place,
Eddie? Lovers' Lane, isn't it?

183
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:08,168
You got it in one,
Billy boy. Lovers' Lane.

184
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:11,129
Oh, no, you see,
what I meant was is

185
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,510
well, those lights over there.
What are they called?

186
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:16,514
Check out the view
from back here, Eduardo.

187
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:17,812
Ah!

188
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,265
Stop that.

189
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:23,649
You're, uh, Superman's
best friend, huh?

190
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:28,863
No. His cousin. I've come here
to search for the omegahedron.

191
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:32,533
It's a power source vital to
Argo City. That's where I live.

192
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,110
No kidding.

193
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:36,867
Eddie and me here

194
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,414
we're on a secret mission also.

195
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,076
We're out looking
for a good time.

196
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:45,922
And you just won
the brass ring, baby.

197
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:04,982
Oh, she works out, huh?

198
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:06,525
Why are you doing this?

199
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:09,524
It's just the way we are.

200
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,363
You shouldn't have
done that, baby.

201
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,208
Come on.

202
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,838
Oh, <i>I</i> see.

203
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:36,055
You really wanna play games,
eh, sweetheart?

204
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:38,674
Come on. Come...

205
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:39,894
Ow!

206
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:46,769
Huh?

207
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:52,147
Eddie, I think maybe we should

208
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:56,234
kinda keep this to ourselves.
What do you think?

209
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:04,534
Freddie, you little
devil. How are you?

210
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,416
Fresh ammunition, everybody.

211
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:19,181
Try telling your wife.
I need another.

212
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:21,593
Where is it? Where's
the little mystery ball?

213
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:24,395
Let me have a peek.
Maybe I can shed some light.

214
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:25,391
I hate light.

215
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:27,894
Is it electrical?
Is it hot to the touch?

216
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,192
- Where is it?
- Safe and sound.

217
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:33,154
Go mix.
Leave me to my thoughts.

218
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,606
Go mix? With these people?
You must be mad.

219
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:37,863
Who are they?
Wrinkly little wretches.

220
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:40,779
These are my
foot soldiers, Nigel.

221
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:43,410
My army of the night.

222
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:48,036
I'm considering nothing
less than world... domination.

223
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:49,836
After you left me in the lurch

224
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:52,040
I saw something that should
worry you greatly

225
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,717
<i>if you're serious about
taking over this planet.</i>

226
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:59,548
My secret was blue and red
and it knew how to fly.

227
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,341
I've a secret too, Nigel.

228
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:05,220
I have the power.

229
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:07,309
Get that through your head.

230
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:10,479
Oh, I bet they're
in for it now, eh?

231
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:12,484
Count on it.

232
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:20,527
I have in my time seen
a great number of things

233
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:22,032
even more impressive

234
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:25,035
than a human cigarette
lighter, dear lady.

235
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,412
To wit.

236
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:34,214
What is that?

237
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,885
Overreaching ambition.

238
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:39,097
Take heed.

239
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,973
Touched a little
nerve, didn't I?

240
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,305
Hello.

241
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,022
Hello.

242
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:50,223
The red toad
that lurks in the briars

243
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,479
and brambles
is full of sorceries.

244
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,477
There's a little bone
on the left side.

245
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:55,310
A little bone?

246
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:58,273
A little bone, which
if bound to a man stirs up

247
00:26:58,492 --> 00:27:00,074
the greatest lust.

248
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:03,487
- I wanna be rich and famous.
- Then stick with me.

249
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:07,577
I was put on this earth
to thrill millions.

250
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:10,956
Mmm, this is scrumptious.

251
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:14,584
Why don't we go somewhere
else and <i>dance</i> cheek to cheek?

252
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:26,343
Stop it, Selena!
That's not fair.

253
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:28,052
<i>Pick on me.</i>

254
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:38,271
- Thanks.
- Hey, no sweat.

255
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,948
- What happened?
- Oh, nothing much.

256
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:43,863
Get out of my house, Nigel

257
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:47,454
and don't come slithering back.

258
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,907
I'm warning you, Selena

259
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:52,084
don't be so shortsighted.

260
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,016
Good morning.

261
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:20,730
Have you got it, <i>Lucy?</i>
Must be near that oak tree.

262
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:23,065
<i>- Hurry up.</i>
- <i>Found it,</i> guys.

263
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:26,949
<i>What are you doing?
You're supposed to find the ball.</i>

264
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,375
<i>Come on, don't take all day.
You're holding up the game.</i>

265
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:36,875
- Hey, it's your turn to bat.
- Let's go. Let's go.

266
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:38,956
<i>Okay. Okay.
Let's play ball.</i>

267
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:40,883
Alright, batter.

268
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:52,762
I couldn't make it.
I have to finish my...

269
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,576
<i>Hey, toss the
ball back, will you?</i>

270
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,007
<i>Come on,
make it two in</i> a <i>row.</i>

271
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:32,309
Play ball.

272
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,769
- <i>Where have you been?
- With the principal.</i>

273
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,329
Danvers is doing
his usual number.

274
00:29:56,545 --> 00:29:58,331
Jeez, another barfy new student.

275
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:01,255
They're really scraping the
bottom of the barrel these days.

276
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:04,337
Hang in there, Danvers.

277
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:05,968
Don't let them get to you.

278
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:10,674
Thirty days. Semester
just started. You'll be...

279
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:13,846
- Hello, I...
- Didn't knock.

280
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:16,349
Don't we teach you
manners around here?

281
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:18,245
Don't we try to impress
on our young ladies

282
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:20,149
that animals
in the jungle never knock

283
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,478
but Midvale girls always do.
Where you going? Come back here.

284
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:25,573
Come in.

285
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:28,775
I forgot, I'm just not used to...

286
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:30,447
Wait a minute.

287
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:33,366
Wait just one second.

288
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:37,458
I have never before
in my life laid eyes on you

289
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:38,669
have I, young lady?

290
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,498
- No, sir, I'm new here.
- New here?

291
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:43,297
Obviously you're new if I've
never laid eyes on you before.

292
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:46,046
The question remains,
just who on earth are you?

293
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:48,596
Umm...

294
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:52,844
On Earth, I'm Lee.

295
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:54,435
Linda Lee.

296
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,269
Where's your letter
of recommendation?

297
00:30:57,481 --> 00:30:58,481
Letter?

298
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,389
I must talk to you, principal.

299
00:31:01,068 --> 00:31:03,560
- I am busy now.
- So are they, them.

300
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:05,941
All the little monsters
you admit to the place.

301
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:09,069
<i>They have nailed
my desk drawers shut.</i>

302
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:12,072
Never in all my years
as a school teacher...

303
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,287
Come, Danvers.

304
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:14,703
I will not be provoked.

305
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:17,282
I will not let him
get to me this semester.

306
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:18,912
I'll be strong.
Be strong.

307
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,538
Be like a rock.

308
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:35,703
What did you say your name was?

309
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:38,685
Oh, yes.
Linda Lee, huh?

310
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:40,604
Yes, my cousin
probably wrote you.

311
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:43,524
Umm, maybe you got
his letter under K for Kent?

312
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:44,975
In your files.

313
00:31:45,195 --> 00:31:46,195
Kent?

314
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:47,486
Kent?

315
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,989
It doesn't ring any bells.

316
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,818
Doesn't even ring a...

317
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:58,079
Oh, here it is.
Big as life.

318
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,138
<i>"My dear Mr. Danvers,
I'm writing on behalf</i>

319
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:02,000
<i>of a very
special young lady."</i>

320
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:03,587
An orphan?

321
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:05,942
Don't expect to be treated
any differently

322
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:07,047
on that account, Miss Lee.

323
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:08,624
Oh, no, sir, I won't.

324
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:10,426
One way or another,
we're all alone

325
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:13,675
on this... miserable
little planet.

326
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:15,714
Yes, sir, I know.

327
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:18,746
<i>Since your school records
were obviously lost in the mail</i>

328
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,602
you'll have to start
at the bottom.

329
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:22,396
It's only fair
to the other girls.

330
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:26,271
You'll have English, Latin,
math, biology, computing...

331
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:27,647
All at once?

332
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:28,978
...and chemistry.

333
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:32,360
Idle hands are the
devil's playground. This way.

334
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,911
- Man on the floor!
- Man on the floor!

335
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,508
Open up, Lane, I know
you're in there.

336
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,845
I'm not decent,
Mr. Danvers sir.

337
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:05,598
And you never will be either.
You little liar.

338
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:10,819
Come on in. Come on in.
I haven't got all year.

339
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:12,271
No.

340
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,364
I'm supposed to have
a single this term.

341
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:16,613
We don't always get
what we want, Miss Lane.

342
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,865
Disappointments
thicken our skins.

343
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,991
Who wants thick skin?

344
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:24,454
I'm Linda Lee.

345
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:29,080
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

346
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:31,710
I'm Lucy Lane.

347
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:33,634
Lucy Lee, this is Linda Lane.

348
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:35,468
- No, it isn't.
- <i>What?</i>

349
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,842
- She's Linda Lee and I'm...
- Lucy Lane.

350
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,806
You two know each other.

351
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:41,679
Oh, no. We just met.

352
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:44,015
- When?
- Just now.

353
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:46,643
But we've known each other
for years, haven't we, Linda?

354
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,940
- Oh, gee, I don't think I...
- Oh, of course.

355
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:51,314
The Daily Planet, of course.

356
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:55,068
Linda's cousin works there. And
your sister, what's her name?

357
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:57,490
The one that's always
calling me and bothering me?

358
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,194
- Lois.
- Ah, yes, that's the one.

359
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:04,077
Anyway, show our new
Miss Lee around, Miss Lane.

360
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,709
Oh, by the way, she's an orphan

361
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:10,288
but don't let her play
on your sympathies, hmm?

362
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,346
So, who's your cousin?

363
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:29,567
Clark Kent.

364
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:32,809
You're kidding me.

365
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,729
Clark Kent's your cousin?
You're putting me on.

366
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:38,111
- You know him?
- Do I know him?

367
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:39,782
Does my sister know him?

368
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:43,579
- Now, that's the big question.
- Oh, I see.

369
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,518
I guess, if they worked
at the same newspaper

370
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:46,703
they must know each other.

371
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,535
- Well...
- ls this where I'll sleep?

372
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:52,246
Well, this is your bed,
but we don't sleep around here.

373
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:55,040
Nonstop excitement in this dorm.

374
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,215
All the real dementals
are sent here.

375
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,847
So, when's the rest
of your stuff arriving?

376
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:05,684
I don't have any other stuff.

377
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,556
What? It's all
in that little bag?

378
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:13,726
Oh, well, you see, I have the
means to buy more, it's just...

379
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,061
Well, I just haven't
had the chance since...

380
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,668
- Do you know him?
- Superman? Sure.

381
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:39,051
<i>My sister's got something
goin' with the big guy.</i>

382
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:40,822
Listen, you can borrow
any of my clothes

383
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:44,093
any time you want.
Just dig in and help yourself.

384
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:46,599
Thank you.
You're very kind.

385
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:52,059
He's a real character.
A real hunk.

386
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,640
<i>I'll introduce you
to him someday</i>

387
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:56,101
<i>if we wind up getting along.</i>

388
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:04,360
Now, then, focus your tiny minds

389
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,695
on the kind of problem
that it used to take

390
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:09,623
weeks of thought
before the computer.

391
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:11,742
Even now it can take a long time

392
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:14,077
without certain algorithms

393
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:17,710
which... if you behave
for two seconds

394
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:20,213
I might reveal to you.

395
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:30,682
Love, hate, love, hate.

396
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:32,645
Love.

397
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:34,852
<i>The cards have decided</i>

398
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:38,026
<i>people will do
anything for love.</i>

399
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,983
They'll jump off
cliffs for love.

400
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:43,698
<i>They'll drown themselves
like lemmings.</i>

401
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:49,405
So... I'll make
everybody love me.

402
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:51,286
Oh, no chance.

403
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:53,788
You're an awful person,
honey, remember? Forget it.

404
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:57,416
Use your imagination, pinhead.
That's what magic is all about.

405
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,213
Why are we not moving?

406
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,637
Because I'm in love.

407
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:09,717
<i>Come here,
you beautiful thing.</i>

408
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,553
He's cute.

409
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,351
Hell, what's going on?

410
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:22,654
<i>Here's an exercise in big
numbers I want you to try...</i>

411
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,358
<i>It's trying
to tell</i> me <i>something.</i>

412
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,781
Well, what?
That we're near danger?

413
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:30,613
I don't know.
How do I know?

414
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:39,755
- I know.
- Well, tell me.

415
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:42,165
My prince has come.

416
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:44,626
Oh, no.

417
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:46,132
I saw him first, Selena.

418
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:48,463
That's not fair.
I copied his number first.

419
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:51,015
Well done.
Now, let's get out of here.

420
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,375
<i>...average size
of</i> a <i>Chinese family</i>

421
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:59,983
<i>average age of death
and marriage and pregnancy.</i>

422
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:02,562
<i>Use this equation to
compute the population of China</i>

423
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:04,488
<i>in the year 2040.</i>

424
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:07,528
Linda... are you with us?

425
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:12,158
Umm...

426
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,623
- Yes, sir, I am.
- Oh, are you?

427
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,041
Where, might I ask?

428
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,828
W-well, here, sir.
On Earth... sir.

429
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,794
How fortunate
for the rest of us.

430
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,752
May I presume that whilst
you were staring at the wall

431
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:30,555
and not at your terminal like
your other little friends here

432
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:32,883
you were in fact, hard at work

433
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:36,140
solving this little equation?

434
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:38,347
Oh, yes, sir, I was.

435
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,227
- I mean, I was...
- Excellent.

436
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:41,645
The answer, please.

437
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:45,479
Pay attention, class, Miss Lee
is about to enlighten us.

438
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:48,531
Five billion, two hundred
and seventy one million

439
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:49,778
nine thousand and ten.

440
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:57,874
Come on, let's get outta here
before he makes you stay.

441
00:38:58,545 --> 00:38:59,910
<i>Come on, hurry.</i>

442
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:07,084
Miss Lee.

443
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:09,340
- Oh, shit.
- Yes, sir?

444
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:11,634
Have you been going
through my papers?

445
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:13,723
Of course not, sir.

446
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:15,972
Then how do you know
the correct answer?

447
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,178
- How?
- I guess, I just...

448
00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:20,514
It's all this crazy weather
we've been having, sir.

449
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:23,647
<i>All the storms, shock
waves, electromagnetism.</i>

450
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:25,899
It makes people smarter
than they are for a second.

451
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:27,354
We gotta go, sir.

452
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:32,258
Oh, boy, thanks.
You know I gotta learn...

453
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:33,948
How did you know the answer?

454
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:37,118
I don't know.
Six-dimensional geometry.

455
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,244
- I never could do it before.
- Yeah.

456
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,371
Well, you want some
friendly advice?

457
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:44,421
Don't go showing it off
'cause nobody's gonna like you.

458
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,039
I'll see you later.

459
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,392
Ah!

460
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,476
Nice going.

461
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:01,350
You know she tripped
you on purpose?

462
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:04,976
Absolutely.
She's retarded.

463
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,612
<i>There's not much time left.
Come on, let's go.</i>

464
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:13,616
You take it, Myra.

465
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:17,746
Hey, Myra, see if you can
put Lane out for good.

466
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:23,827
<i>Come on, team. Come on.</i>

467
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,670
Hey, you guys alright?

468
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,859
- Oh, God. What happened?
- Yes. You alright?

469
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,266
Myra, how'd she do that?

470
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:40,185
- It hit her shoulder.
- I don't know.

471
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:43,354
Hey, you guys, did you see that
cute guy in the softball field?

472
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:44,647
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

473
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,442
With the black
hair and the big muscles?

474
00:40:47,654 --> 00:40:48,654
He was something else.

475
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,363
- <i>Did you talk to him?
- No, but I'm gonna.</i>

476
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:52,905
<i>Talk? Who'd
waste time talking?</i>

477
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:56,030
<i>He's working on the trees,
could be around for a while.</i>

478
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:00,538
- Are they in?
- Yes.

479
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:07,003
<i>Myra, you sure you
wanna go through with this?</i>

480
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:09,331
<i>Hey, what's with you?
Chicken?</i>

481
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:12,466
<i>Oh, boy, I'm really
gonna enjoy this.</i>

482
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:14,966
<i>I can't wait to hear
them scream.</i>

483
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:18,344
Why don't you shut off the hot
and give them an ice bath?

484
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:20,675
<i>Are you kidding me?
That's nowheresville.</i>

485
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:23,011
If you shut off the cold
you'll scald them.

486
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:25,598
So they lose a little skin.
Serves them right.

487
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:28,145
<i>I want to see them suffer.</i>

488
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:31,363
A-ah!

489
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,031
I am wet!

490
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:40,372
Ow!

491
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:43,915
Don't leave me. Don't leave me!

492
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:48,044
I hate you!

493
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:49,712
You never looked better!

494
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,665
We'll get you all!

495
00:41:58,599 --> 00:41:59,839
What do you think?

496
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:02,676
It looks the same to me.
It's kinda dull.

497
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:07,480
All you need is a couple of
streaks and your ears pierced.

498
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:09,274
I can do it free of charge.

499
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:10,983
My ears what?

500
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,061
Pierced. Like in you know,
I take a needle

501
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:16,649
I heat it up and then I dab it
with some alcohol and zap.

502
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:18,279
All the guys go crazy.

503
00:42:18,828 --> 00:42:20,944
Because I've holes in my ears?

504
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:22,746
What are you, putting me on?

505
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:25,328
Sometimes I can't
figure you out, Linda.

506
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:30,253
So, where are you
going this weekend?

507
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:31,465
<i>Nowhere.</i>

508
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:33,381
Nowhere? Well, you can't
stay around here.

509
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:35,049
This place is depressing.

510
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,002
<i>I mean, like the tombs.</i>

511
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,757
<i>- Why'?
- Why?</i>

512
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:40,839
<i>What, were you born yesterday?</i>

513
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,099
This is a three-day weekend.

514
00:42:43,603 --> 00:42:45,139
A three-day weekend.

515
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:48,647
So, listen. Why don't
you come home with me?

516
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:51,559
<i>I only live about five miles
from here and I got this guy</i>

517
00:42:51,778 --> 00:42:53,143
<i>coming up from Metropolis.</i>

518
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:55,479
I think he knows
your cousin Clark.

519
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:57,605
<i>His name's Jimmy Olsen.</i>

520
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,241
<i>I think he's real stuck on me.</i>

521
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:04,078
Anyways, I could ask him
to bring a friend along.

522
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:07,950
- What are you doing?
- Oh, nothing.

523
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:09,169
<i>Nothing.</i>

524
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:12,662
No, I think I'm gonna
stay here and study

525
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:14,623
get things organized.

526
00:43:16,219 --> 00:43:18,051
Don't forget to
call me Saturday.

527
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:19,885
Just a sec.

528
00:43:21,808 --> 00:43:22,808
- Hey, Linda.
- Hi.

529
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:24,761
I'll see you later
at Popeye's then, okay?

530
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:28,015
- Alright, I'll try. I promise.
- You better. It's gonna be fun.

531
00:43:28,231 --> 00:43:29,231
<i>'</i> Bye-bye.
- Bye.

532
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:30,315
Have a good time.

533
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:32,682
<i>Come along now, Lucy.</i>

534
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:37,070
<i>- Oh, mom, how are you doing?
- I've had a terrible week.</i>

535
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:48,467
"Take a spider off his web...

536
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:53,604
"...and shut him up inside...

537
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:57,768
"...two shells of a nut.

538
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:03,110
"Now, boil the nut in oil

"into some water.

Right.

547
00:45:28,601 --> 00:45:32,014
"Uh, so long as the spider
is shut up in the nutshell.

548
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:35,063
"Or one day goes by...

549
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:37,731
...whichever comes first."

550
00:45:37,944 --> 00:45:39,776
Big deal, one day.

551
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:41,853
Why don't you just use,
you know.

552
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:43,939
I'm saving it for bigger things.

553
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:46,779
<i>Hi, folks,
you're missing the big sale.</i>

554
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:49,782
<i>Country and western boys
from the Chicago area.</i>

555
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:52,238
<i>Now to start off the hour.</i>

556
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:11,303
Bianca, get the door.

557
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:14,935
Bianca!

558
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:21,772
You rang?

559
00:46:21,988 --> 00:46:22,988
Hey, you!

560
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:26,700
I said...

561
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:28,858
...you rang?

562
00:46:29,078 --> 00:46:30,078
Oh, yeah.

563
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:31,490
How you doing?

564
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,999
Uh, I'm looking for some person
called Mrs. Selena?

565
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:40,749
- Madame Selena.
- Oh.

566
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:44,587
And you found her, lucky boy.

567
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:47,050
<i>Entrer.</i>

568
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:52,848
You must be very popular
in the neighborhood.

569
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,971
I always see your truck
parked around.

570
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:56,473
Oh, yeah.

571
00:46:56,689 --> 00:46:59,977
Yeah, I get a lot of repeat
business. People like my work.

572
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:03,401
Yes, I'm sure they do.

573
00:47:07,116 --> 00:47:08,948
- Wet your whistle?
- Huh?

574
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:12,653
Oh, yeah, yeah, as a matter
of fact, I don't mind if I do.

575
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:44,817
So, uh, where's
the one... ha-ha at?

576
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:46,029
It dropped dead.

577
00:47:46,155 --> 00:47:47,566
Where at exactly?
Uh, out back?

578
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:50,194
We might get to know each other
a little more

579
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:55,279
before we dig in
and talk real turkey.

580
00:47:57,166 --> 00:47:59,874
Well, uh, see, I'm kind of
a private person, you know.

581
00:48:00,086 --> 00:48:02,578
I mean, I do my work, I go home.

582
00:48:03,172 --> 00:48:04,583
- To your wife?
- No.

583
00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:06,915
At the present moment in time
I'm currently enjoying

584
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:08,966
a single status in
my personal life.

585
00:48:09,178 --> 00:48:10,213
Cheers.

586
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:12,387
Bottoms up, huh?

587
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:13,598
Bottoms up.

588
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:22,184
I, I noticed you got a pretty
alkaline-looking soil out there.

589
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:24,098
What I want...

590
00:48:24,777 --> 00:48:27,815
...are some houseplants
inside here.

591
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:32,114
Something that goes well
with the house.

592
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:34,317
This is a house?

593
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:36,577
Of course, it's a house.

594
00:48:37,123 --> 00:48:39,740
There's the bedroom over there.

595
00:48:42,962 --> 00:48:45,078
I think it's getting
dark in here.

596
00:48:47,133 --> 00:48:51,047
You know, what kind of plant
is gonna wanna...

597
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:53,378
...grow in this dump?

598
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:56,047
I don't know.

599
00:48:56,809 --> 00:48:58,470
Shade plants.

600
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:00,385
- To us.
- Hm?

601
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:04,431
And to the seeds
we'll plant together.

602
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:07,312
Yeah, I'll-I'll drink...

603
00:49:07,528 --> 00:49:08,814
...to that.

604
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:15,324
Hm, you probably killed him,
you know.

605
00:49:19,415 --> 00:49:21,782
Sleep well.

606
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:23,579
And when you wake...

607
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:27,913
...drown in my eyes
and be all mine.

608
00:49:30,468 --> 00:49:33,836
If that's the goddamn
Jehovah's witnesses again.

609
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:35,590
I'll get it.

610
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:44,687
Oh, hello, Nigel.
It's you.

611
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:46,639
<i>Nice suit.</i>

612
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:48,860
Subtle.

613
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:50,647
I want to see Selena.

614
00:49:50,863 --> 00:49:53,070
She's indisposed at the moment.

615
00:49:53,282 --> 00:49:56,445
<i>Whoever it is,
we don't want any.</i>

616
00:49:56,744 --> 00:49:58,985
It's Nigel and
he's not going away

617
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:01,037
until he talks to you.

618
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,786
What the devil do you want?

619
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:07,118
I want to make
a very serious proposal.

620
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:08,338
In that outfit?

621
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:12,082
This is a leisure suit.
I've got three days off

622
00:50:12,301 --> 00:50:13,712
from those little beasts
at Midvale

623
00:50:13,928 --> 00:50:15,919
and I intend to let
my hair down.

624
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:24,093
Uh-oh.

625
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:10,060
That ball will not operate
at it's fullest

626
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:13,485
until you internalize
your power, Selena.

627
00:51:13,696 --> 00:51:16,529
Some mosaic invocations.

628
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,196
- Some what?
- Come again?

629
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:20,320
<i>Exactly, that's my point.</i>

630
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:23,570
You girls are rank amateurs
playing with fire.

631
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:26,577
Because we own the matches.

632
00:51:27,251 --> 00:51:30,585
I, of all people,
know a hustle when I hear one.

633
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:31,831
Now, goodbye, Nigel.

634
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:34,254
- It was nice talking to you.
- No, it wasn't.

635
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:38,004
I hate to seem pushy,
my fairest of the <i>fair</i> but...

636
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:39,631
A word of advice, Nigel.

637
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:41,804
If I had your skin problems,

638
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:44,508
I'd stop bothering people,
put a bag over my head,

639
00:51:44,727 --> 00:51:46,217
and go live under a bridge!

640
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:47,437
<i>Ouch!</i>

641
00:51:49,398 --> 00:51:51,309
There's nothing wrong
with my skin.

642
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:55,317
That bitch.

643
00:51:57,865 --> 00:52:00,072
You know, some people.

644
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:03,067
Where is he?

645
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:05,744
Where is he?

646
00:52:14,757 --> 00:52:16,623
Where is he?

647
00:52:17,593 --> 00:52:19,755
Whoever he sees first,
he'll love with all his heart.

648
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,552
What?
For a day tops, right?

649
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:23,825
He was too young
for you anyway, you know.

650
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:26,887
No, I do not know.
Where is he?

651
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:35,808
<i>Hey, I know that guy.</i>

652
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:45,280
- Oh, the cable's out.
- Oh, what cable?

653
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:47,453
This is a mirror.

654
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:50,998
So, how come we could...

655
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:52,666
...ever see him in it?

656
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:55,165
That was magic, dammit.

657
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:57,084
The power.

658
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:59,836
Oh, so make it happen again,
you know?

659
00:53:00,052 --> 00:53:03,920
I... can't make it happen again.
I don't know how I did it.

660
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:05,174
Oh.

661
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:08,136
Maybe, you should let
that thing out of it's box.

662
00:53:08,644 --> 00:53:11,056
Maybe, it's more powerful
if you let it out of it's box.

663
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:12,271
- The box.
- The box.

664
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:14,100
- Where is it?
- The box?

665
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:16,148
It's underneath the rug,
where you left it.

666
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:17,771
Go ahead.

667
00:53:24,993 --> 00:53:26,279
It's stuck.

668
00:53:29,998 --> 00:53:31,659
This is not my day.

669
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:33,876
It's stuck?

670
00:53:33,961 --> 00:53:35,167
How could it be stuck?

671
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:37,996
It's growing.

672
00:53:38,841 --> 00:53:41,299
<i>How could it be growing?
It's made out of lead.</i>

673
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:54,605
Oh.

674
00:53:54,732 --> 00:53:56,097
Too bad, there's no sound.

675
00:53:57,276 --> 00:53:59,267
How come there's no sound?

676
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:02,148
Get off the road, turkey!

677
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:05,234
<i>(make it“ Hey, dummy,
you wanna die?</i>

Smoking, stupid?

679
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:09,273
You wanna kill yourself?

681

every cent, clean him out.</i>

682
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:27,302
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

683
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:35,765
Here you go, everybody.
Who wants onion rings?

684
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:37,016
- Yeah, here.
- Thanks.

685
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:39,314
<i>- Some French fries?
- French fries are mine.</i>

686
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,688
Chicken for myself.
Thank you.

687
00:54:41,904 --> 00:54:43,486
<i>- Thanks.
- Side order tomatoes?</i>

688
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,028
Thanks for inviting me, Lucy.

689
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,571
I'm glad you could come, Jimmy.

690
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:49,025
- <i>You want</i> a <i>root beer?
- Yeah, thanks.</i>

691
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:52,070
Oh, there's Linda.

692
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:56,077
Hey, Linda!

693
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:58,584
- Hi.
- Oh, hello.

694
00:54:58,796 --> 00:55:00,127
That's Clark Kent's cousin?

695
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:01,754
<i>Who's Clark Kent?</i>

696
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:02,840
<i>Is</i> that Linda?

697
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:07,459
- Guess what.
- What?

698
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:09,559
There's this all-night party
tonight at Eddie's.

699
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,051
He's the guy with the tattoo.

700
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:12,631
His folks are out of town.

701
00:55:12,935 --> 00:55:15,927
And the guy with the bow tie,
that's Jimmy.

702
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:17,928
So, you wanna come?

703
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:20,515
I don't know. I'm not
signed out for an overnight.

704
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:23,351
So what? Go back, sign in
and climb out the window.

705
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:25,527
Mrs. Murphy's drunk
as a skunk by now.

706
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:27,229
Totally on another planet.

707
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:29,565
Oh, I don't know.
It just doesn't seem right.

708
00:55:29,785 --> 00:55:31,571
But that's why it'll be fun.

709

<i>'</i> Okay?
<i>'</i> Okay,

710

<i>Hey, stupid.</i>

712
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:40,534
Look at that dingleberry.

713
00:55:40,921 --> 00:55:42,411
What's a dingleberry?

714
00:55:42,631 --> 00:55:46,090
Hey, you, space cadet!
Get out of the street!

715
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:50,799
- What is wrong with him?
- I don't know.

716
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:52,425
He's probably on drugs.

717
00:55:52,641 --> 00:55:54,973
And he's gonna get creamed
if he's not too careful.

718
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:57,802
- Hi. Jimmy Olsen, photographer.
- Oh, I-I'm Kara.

719
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,182
- Who?
- Who?

720
00:55:59,398 --> 00:56:00,479
Oh, I'm...

721
00:56:01,233 --> 00:56:02,394
...concerned.

722
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:04,525
Well, that if
we don't do something.

723
00:56:04,736 --> 00:56:07,319
You go out there, try to help
a guy like that and he's

724
00:56:07,573 --> 00:56:09,439
<i>probably got a gun or a knife.</i>

725

<i>It's not too safe.</i>

726

Hey, I'm starving.
Let's eat.

727
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:14,618
Come on, Linda.

728
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:22,000
Power of shadow.

<i>Bring him to me.</i>

730
00:57:01,585 --> 00:57:02,791
Whoa.

731
00:57:06,632 --> 00:57:09,090
Look at that.

732
00:57:14,723 --> 00:57:16,213
<i>Hey, get out.</i>

00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:23,387

<i>MY Car!</i>

00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:43,976
You've never seen a tattoo
before, Linda?

00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:45,848
<i>- Look'.
- What's that?</i>

737
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:47,646
<i>There's somebody hanging

738
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:49,519
<i>Doesn't look like
there's anybody driving.</i>

739
00:58:50,736 --> 00:58:53,273
Oh, my God.
It's a runaway.

740
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:00,304
- Somebody's gotta do something.
- Hey, what's she doing?

741
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:02,285
Lucy, be careful.
Lucy!

742
00:59:03,415 --> 00:59:05,372
- Come on.
- Lucy!

743
00:59:39,493 --> 00:59:40,949
God, there's the pump?

744
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:13,649
<i>She's still in there.</i>

745
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:22,783
- Oh, excuse me. I'm in a rush.
- I know the feeling.

746
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,831
Are you okay?

747
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:32,626
<i>It's gasoline!

- Hey, look at that.
- What?

749
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:50,028
A storm dragon?

750
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:54,078
A Supergirl.

751
01:02:43,969 --> 01:02:45,630
Oh, my God!

752
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:52,845
Don't. Don't look at her.

753
01:02:59,526 --> 01:03:01,016
You're gonna be alright.

754
01:03:01,236 --> 01:03:03,318
There's no broken bones.

755
01:03:09,995 --> 01:03:11,030
I love you.

756
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:14,412
What did he say?

757
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:16,247
What did he say?

758
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:18,534
Looked like "I love you", to me.

759
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:21,586
No! No!

760
01:03:22,507 --> 01:03:23,872
You love me?

With all my heart, forever.

762
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:29,882
A bird of free and careless wing

763
01:03:30,098 --> 01:03:32,055
was I through many
a smiling spring.

764
01:03:32,434 --> 01:03:33,799
The cold repulse,
the look askance.

765
01:03:34,019 --> 01:03:36,761
The lightning of
love's angry glance, stay.

766
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:39,847
Let me behold you.

767
01:03:54,873 --> 01:03:56,784
L-I have to go.

768
01:04:00,295 --> 01:04:02,127
Oh, I-l have to go.

769
01:04:05,133 --> 01:04:06,527
<i>Everything's under control.</i>

01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:07,712
Lucy!

771
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:10,043
<i>Just go on,

772
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:11,263
Lucy!

773
01:04:12,015 --> 01:04:13,346
- Oh.
- Thank God.

774
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:18,142
- You alright?
- I think so.

775
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:19,598
I hit my head.

776
01:04:20,357 --> 01:04:21,688
Nigel must know her.

777
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:25,150
She must be one of his students.
He must have put her up to it.

778
01:04:25,362 --> 01:04:27,603
No. I don't think that at all.

779
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:29,984
Oh, she just happened
to be in the wrong place

780
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,941
at the wrong time, right?

781
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:35,528
Materializing
in a bulldozer, huh?

782
01:04:35,747 --> 01:04:36,908
She's a wimpy little thing.

783
01:04:37,165 --> 01:04:39,045
I don't know why you care
what she does, anyway.

784
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:42,668
Because nobody gets in my way.

785
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:44,357
Why don't you just leave
this poor kid alone

786
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:46,292
and worry about the
other one that flies?

787
01:04:46,758 --> 01:04:50,251
I worry about everything.
It's my job. Stand back.

788
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:54,054
Oh, come on now.
She's just a teenager.

789
01:04:54,265 --> 01:04:58,805
What good is a sword
if it's not unleashed?

790
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:01,512
But she's a total zero.
You don't even know her name.

791
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:05,224
The naming of names
is not necessary.

792
01:05:05,693 --> 01:05:08,526
Let us concentrate on her face.

793
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:12,023
And my Shadow will do the rest.

794
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:13,610
Your what?

795
01:05:14,202 --> 01:05:15,943
Power of Shadow...

796
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:18,700
...take shape.

797
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:23,246
Look like a vicious dark star.

798
01:05:23,962 --> 01:05:27,671
Seek out, that
wretched young creature.

799
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:31,216
And destroy her wherever she...

800
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:34,930
...are.

801
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:36,676
Oh, God.
That's awful.

802
01:05:36,891 --> 01:05:38,347
That's never gonna work.

803
01:05:58,121 --> 01:05:59,156
Oh, my God!

804
01:06:00,748 --> 01:06:01,988
I'm scared.

805
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:29,057
Next time...

806
01:06:30,695 --> 01:06:32,606
...remind me to
do this outside.

807
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:19,361
Leave this place and do no harm.

808
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:23,151
There she is again.

809
01:09:25,078 --> 01:09:26,078
What did she say?

810
01:09:26,913 --> 01:09:28,324
No, this is not possible.

811
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:30,906
This is not right.

812
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:32,490
Where's the wimp?

813
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:34,127
Ah!

814
01:09:35,338 --> 01:09:36,453
Ah!

815
01:09:45,932 --> 01:09:47,013
Ah!

816
01:09:48,685 --> 01:09:50,596
I think he can take care of her.

817
01:09:50,812 --> 01:09:51,812
Ah!

818
01:09:53,064 --> 01:09:54,395
Ah!

819
01:10:13,793 --> 01:10:16,080
See?
What did I tell you?

820
01:10:16,963 --> 01:10:18,545
She quit, right?

821
01:10:18,756 --> 01:10:19,756
Wrong.

822
01:11:25,573 --> 01:11:27,405
Every time!

823
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:29,483
Every time!

824
01:11:29,702 --> 01:11:32,660
Send a man to do a woman's job
and that's what you get.

825
01:11:33,498 --> 01:11:37,082
Damn her eyes.
Who is she?

826
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:40,331
- Are you asking me?
- I'm telling you.

827
01:11:41,047 --> 01:11:42,253
Find out!

828
01:11:42,465 --> 01:11:46,299
Well, sure. But, you know,
I think I recognize the costume.

829
01:11:51,599 --> 01:11:53,340
<i>Leave him alone. Let him.</i>

830
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:55,300
Where have you been?

831
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,181
- Outside...
- Look at you.

832
01:11:58,022 --> 01:11:59,387
Look at those clothes.

833
01:11:59,607 --> 01:12:00,938
Oh, I'll go change.
I-I'm sorry.

834
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:04,438
And you'll put on
your proper school uniform.

835
01:12:04,654 --> 01:12:07,146
And get out of that
ridiculous costume.

836
01:12:07,365 --> 01:12:08,365
Yes, ma'am.

837
01:12:08,533 --> 01:12:10,615
- And cover your legs.
- Yes, ma'am.

838
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:13,659
Don't you "yes, ma'am" me.

839
01:12:13,871 --> 01:12:15,111
No, ma'am.

840
01:12:17,792 --> 01:12:19,792
I think you're blowing
this thing out of proportion

841
01:12:19,877 --> 01:12:20,877
if you want my opinion.

842
01:12:21,128 --> 01:12:24,462
Oh, no. This box is
definitely getting bigger...

843
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:26,881
...and uglier.

844
01:12:27,093 --> 01:12:29,004
All I'm saying is
you can't go nuts

845
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:31,882
over a landscape guy and a
teenager in a blue suit.

846
01:12:32,098 --> 01:12:33,509
She flies.

847
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:36,261
Can you get that through
your thick skull

848
01:12:36,477 --> 01:12:38,969
and into your
tiny brain, Bianca?

849
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:41,600
The girl can fly.

850
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:00,077
Okay-

851
01:13:00,459 --> 01:13:01,540
Now.

852
01:13:01,961 --> 01:13:04,498
Let's get serious.

853
01:13:05,548 --> 01:13:08,290
Come to mama.

854
01:13:10,136 --> 01:13:11,718
<i>- Oh.
- Oh.</i>

855
01:13:14,765 --> 01:13:16,005
Oh.

856
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:17,225
Whoa.

857
01:13:34,201 --> 01:13:37,569
- Selena, cut it out.
- I'm not doing it.

858
01:14:06,984 --> 01:14:08,941
I think we're venturing where

859
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:12,111
you know, fools rush in
and angels fear to tread.

860
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:15,440
I'm no angel.

861
01:15:04,792 --> 01:15:06,203
It's the wimp again.

862
01:15:07,128 --> 01:15:09,210
And she's trespassing.

863
01:15:27,732 --> 01:15:29,097
Hello.

864
01:15:29,316 --> 01:15:31,648
Oh, no. Not now.

865
01:15:31,861 --> 01:15:34,023
'Tis only but me, my love.

866
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:35,979
Please, you'll let
everyone know.

867
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:37,529
What?
That I love you?

868
01:15:37,742 --> 01:15:39,278
I'd shout it from
the highest hill.

869
01:15:39,493 --> 01:15:41,109
Please don't.

870
01:15:41,328 --> 01:15:44,070
I know you think me the fool,
at least tell me your name.

871
01:15:44,331 --> 01:15:45,662
Linda. Linda Lee.

872
01:15:46,167 --> 01:15:47,167
Linda.

873
01:15:47,835 --> 01:15:49,325
Lovely Linda Lee.

874
01:15:50,337 --> 01:15:52,453
These roses pale beside thee.

875
01:15:54,675 --> 01:15:55,675
Oh.

876
01:15:56,886 --> 01:15:57,946
Well, thank you, but I'm...

877
01:15:57,970 --> 01:16:00,302
And sweet chocolates
for my sweet Linda.

878
01:16:01,932 --> 01:16:03,013
Hm.

879
01:16:12,526 --> 01:16:13,526
What are you doing?

880
01:16:16,030 --> 01:16:17,145
Please?

881
01:16:19,283 --> 01:16:20,364
Oh, no, I...

882
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:21,576
Please.

883
01:16:21,869 --> 01:16:23,530
Well, alright.
But just for a minute.

884
01:16:37,676 --> 01:16:39,212
You hate me, don't you?

885
01:16:40,304 --> 01:16:42,762
Hate you?
I don't even know you.

886
01:16:42,973 --> 01:16:44,259
I don't even know your name.

887
01:16:45,142 --> 01:16:46,142
Ethan.

888
01:16:46,894 --> 01:16:50,603
Say my name aloud but once
and I shall die the happy fool.

889
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:52,055
- Look, Ethan...
- Huh!

890
01:16:55,319 --> 01:16:56,605
Ethan.

891
01:16:58,489 --> 01:16:59,489
Ethan.

892
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:03,611
Your soft caress
did at once renew

893
01:17:03,828 --> 01:17:05,444
the beating of
this broken heart.

894
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:07,911
Are you crazy?

895
01:17:11,252 --> 01:17:12,367
Marry me?

896
01:17:23,597 --> 01:17:24,712
Marry you?

897
01:17:25,724 --> 01:17:27,840
- I don't...
- Don't say it. Don't, please.

898
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:29,060
I know.

899
01:17:29,395 --> 01:17:30,395
What?

900
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:32,933
We're from different worlds.

901
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:36,433
- You mean, you know where I'm...
- Just give me a chance, Linda.

902
01:17:36,944 --> 01:17:39,185
Love makes everything possible.

903
01:17:39,864 --> 01:17:43,448
A poor uneducated gardener can
indeed worship a rich debutante

904
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:45,445
and make her happy
if she'd just...

905
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:47,117
Oh, Ethan.

906
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:49,446
I'm not rich.
I'm just...

907
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:51,906
Well, then I'll support us both.

908
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:55,497
You're nuts, you know that?

909
01:17:55,713 --> 01:17:58,751
You're so sweet,
but you're out of your mind.

910
01:18:00,718 --> 01:18:01,879
Over you.

911
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:12,893
What a touching scene.

912
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:45,718
Round and round they go.

913
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:49,054
Where they stop.

914
01:18:59,777 --> 01:19:02,644
Boy, you're really getting
the hang of this.

915
01:19:04,365 --> 01:19:05,605
Oh.

916
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:12,616
Where is she?

917
01:19:16,543 --> 01:19:18,033
Jesus.

918
01:19:19,046 --> 01:19:20,502
Who are you?

919
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:23,377
I am Selena.

920
01:19:24,218 --> 01:19:26,050
Diadanus of Catania.

921
01:19:26,262 --> 01:19:30,176
Priestess of Sechnid.
I am the ultimate Siren of Endor

922
01:19:30,391 --> 01:19:36,182
and you, little lady, are
trespassing on private property.

923
01:19:36,772 --> 01:19:38,103
She means him.

924
01:19:38,732 --> 01:19:40,814
I am Kara of Argo City.

925
01:19:41,026 --> 01:19:42,937
Daughter of Alura and Zor-El.

926
01:19:43,696 --> 01:19:46,028
And I don't scare easily.

927
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:47,240
No?

928
01:19:47,866 --> 01:19:48,866
<i>No.</i>

929
01:19:49,743 --> 01:19:51,074
Try...

930
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:53,782
...this.

931
01:20:11,307 --> 01:20:14,845
This lady is improving by leaps
and bounds, I gotta tell you.

932
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:39,516
You okay?

933
01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:41,385
No.

934
01:21:43,482 --> 01:21:46,019
You want a hacksaw or somethin'?

935
01:21:58,497 --> 01:22:02,582
Now I am really upset.

936
01:22:50,966 --> 01:22:52,206
What's going on?

937
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:54,760
Oh.

938
01:22:55,304 --> 01:22:56,544
Put me down.

939
01:23:05,689 --> 01:23:07,430
<i>- Where am I?
- You're safe.</i>

940
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:09,686
Safe? Where's Linda?

941
01:23:09,902 --> 01:23:11,518
Put me down.

942
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:18,736
- Where's my Linda?
- Take it easy.

943
01:23:26,668 --> 01:23:27,668
Ethan.

944
01:23:27,794 --> 01:23:29,751
Ha-ha. Very clever.

945
01:23:30,130 --> 01:23:32,337
That ought to keep her out
of your hair for a few hours.

946
01:23:32,674 --> 01:23:35,291
Clever?
A cheap trick.

947
01:23:39,431 --> 01:23:41,547
Power of Shadow.

948
01:23:41,767 --> 01:23:45,351
Bring him to me.

949
01:23:51,276 --> 01:23:56,021
Bring him... to me.

950
01:23:58,784 --> 01:23:59,784
Ugh!

951
01:23:59,910 --> 01:24:00,945
Didn't work, huh?

952
01:24:01,161 --> 01:24:02,492
Maybe they're too far away.

953
01:24:02,704 --> 01:24:05,537
I can make the sky rain coconuts
with pinpoint accuracy.

954
01:24:05,749 --> 01:24:09,538
But I still can't control
men's minds.

955
01:24:10,379 --> 01:24:11,995
Not with her around.

956
01:24:12,214 --> 01:24:13,249
So maybe...

957
01:24:13,465 --> 01:24:15,456
Now, don't go through the roof.

958
01:24:15,676 --> 01:24:17,292
But maybe we ought to back down

959
01:24:17,511 --> 01:24:20,299
and give old
you-know-who a call.

960
01:24:20,973 --> 01:24:22,304
You-know-who.

961
01:24:22,516 --> 01:24:24,177
- Spit it out.
- Nigel.

962
01:24:24,393 --> 01:24:25,975
I shall pretend
you didn't say that.

963
01:24:26,186 --> 01:24:27,347
<i>But I did.</i>

964
01:24:27,563 --> 01:24:29,099
All I'm thinking and forgive me

965
01:24:29,314 --> 01:24:31,271
for thinking out of turn here...

966
01:24:31,733 --> 01:24:33,690
...is that
he's been around.

967
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:36,311
He knows things we don't.

968
01:24:36,863 --> 01:24:38,979
<i>Plus, the way you wrap
him around your little finger</i>

969
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:40,985
<i>I'm always amazed.</i>

970
01:25:20,782 --> 01:25:22,318
What's in it for me?

971
01:25:23,410 --> 01:25:24,445
Me.

972
01:25:24,661 --> 01:25:25,901
Ah-ha.

973
01:25:26,204 --> 01:25:29,117
My dear Nigel, the way to
a woman's heart is through

974
01:25:29,333 --> 01:25:31,415
the elimination of her rivals.

975
01:25:31,752 --> 01:25:33,032
Murder?
Are you proposing that...

976
01:25:33,211 --> 01:25:36,454
Oh, certainly not.
Leave that to me.

977
01:25:36,673 --> 01:25:39,882
You deliver the goods.
Her.

978
01:25:40,218 --> 01:25:41,629
Her? How?

979
01:25:42,346 --> 01:25:43,757
By getting me...

980
01:25:43,972 --> 01:25:45,337
...him.

981
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:48,181
- She'll follow.
- Well, I don't.

982
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:51,184
- Follow any of this, I mean...
- Put that down.

983
01:25:54,608 --> 01:25:56,565
Nigel, I want one thing.

984
01:25:57,027 --> 01:25:59,485
Time to master my new toy.

985
01:25:59,696 --> 01:26:02,233
<i>So, we can rule the world?</i>

986
01:26:02,741 --> 01:26:04,573
And you want him here?

987
01:26:04,785 --> 01:26:06,275
Johnny Appleseed
in your living room?

988
01:26:06,495 --> 01:26:08,452
Yes. In the flesh.

989
01:26:08,664 --> 01:26:10,029
So, she'll follow?

990
01:26:10,415 --> 01:26:13,077
- No other reason?
- None.

991
01:26:13,543 --> 01:26:15,580
You're sure of that?

992
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:20,839
<i>Whoops, I'm sorry.
The little spider got out.</i>

993
01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:22,716
What?

994
01:26:24,846 --> 01:26:26,211
Where am I?

995
01:26:28,141 --> 01:26:30,678
- Who are you?
- Kara.

996
01:26:31,269 --> 01:26:32,269
Kara?

997
01:26:34,564 --> 01:26:35,645
What happened?

998
01:26:35,857 --> 01:26:38,019
You got hit on the head
by a coconut.

999
01:26:38,694 --> 01:26:40,276
- Huh?
- Hm.

1000
01:26:41,029 --> 01:26:42,440
What's with
the Halloween costume?

1001
01:26:44,449 --> 01:26:47,441
This is not a costume.
These are my clothes.

1002
01:26:47,744 --> 01:26:48,744
What do you mean?

1003
01:26:48,995 --> 01:26:50,986
Look, I-I have to go now.

1004
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:53,447
I'll come back for you later.
I've just gotta get back to

1005
01:26:53,709 --> 01:26:54,744
the amusement park.

1006
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:57,076
Amusement park?
Linda!

1007
01:26:59,131 --> 01:27:01,213
I gotta find Linda,
she was in trouble.

1008
01:27:01,925 --> 01:27:05,168
Well, Linda's alright.
She can take care of herself.

1009
01:27:05,387 --> 01:27:06,739
<i>No, no. She can't.
Something's wrong.</i>

1010
01:27:06,763 --> 01:27:08,629
She's in big trouble
and I love her.

1011
01:27:09,599 --> 01:27:11,010
I love her.

1012
01:27:12,853 --> 01:27:14,469
Yeah, I do love her.

1013
01:27:17,649 --> 01:27:19,356
I have to go, Ethan.
Goodbye.

1014
01:27:19,818 --> 01:27:21,149
Yes, so do I.

1015
01:27:22,487 --> 01:27:23,852
Hey!

1016
01:27:28,994 --> 01:27:31,156
I told you Linda can
take care of herself.

1017
01:27:31,371 --> 01:27:34,409
- You just flew over my head.
- I'll take care of everything.

1018
01:27:34,624 --> 01:27:37,286
I said you just flew over
my head. True or false?

1019
01:27:38,462 --> 01:27:39,462
True.

1020
01:27:40,881 --> 01:27:42,246
Like Superman.

1021
01:27:42,632 --> 01:27:43,793
He's my cousin.

1022
01:27:44,593 --> 01:27:46,880
- He's your cousin?
- Yes.

1023
01:27:47,137 --> 01:27:48,798
I shouldn't be telling you
this though...

1024
01:27:49,014 --> 01:27:51,284
Wait one minute. I mean you can
do the whole number, leap tall

1025
01:27:51,308 --> 01:27:53,703
buildings with a single bound?
And look right through things?

1026
01:27:53,727 --> 01:27:56,014
- Yes
- Bend steel bars?

1027
01:27:56,563 --> 01:27:58,679
- Yes.
- Whoa!

1028
01:28:00,609 --> 01:28:02,816
- Oh, Selena. I have to go.
- Wait a minute.

1029
01:28:03,028 --> 01:28:04,464
- Selena has the Omegahedron.
- Please take me with you.

1030
01:28:04,488 --> 01:28:05,978
I have to find Linda.

1031
01:28:09,659 --> 01:28:10,774
What is it?

1032
01:28:11,036 --> 01:28:12,447
The Burundi Wand.

1033
01:28:12,829 --> 01:28:15,787
Pure, unadulterated evil.

1034
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:18,244
Ready?

1035
01:28:47,197 --> 01:28:48,653
But how can you love her?

1036
01:28:48,865 --> 01:28:51,152
- You don't even know her.
- Oh, yeah, I do.

1037
01:28:51,993 --> 01:28:53,638
And she's in trouble,
then I got no business

1038
01:28:53,662 --> 01:28:55,528
standing here, talking with you.

1039
01:28:56,122 --> 01:28:57,783
Even if you are
what you say you are.

1040
01:28:58,041 --> 01:29:00,248
Linda is not in trouble.

1041
01:29:00,627 --> 01:29:03,540
Look, uh, don't make me
get rough, okay?

1042
01:29:03,755 --> 01:29:05,917
You wouldn't stand a chance.

1043
01:29:06,466 --> 01:29:08,048
Please trust me.

1044
01:29:08,718 --> 01:29:10,425
Linda is alright.

1045
01:29:11,763 --> 01:29:13,049
How do you know?

1046
01:29:13,849 --> 01:29:15,260
I just...

1047
01:29:16,726 --> 01:29:17,807
...know.

1048
01:29:29,990 --> 01:29:31,401
Linda.

1049
01:29:41,793 --> 01:29:43,454
Oh, my God.

1050
01:29:44,129 --> 01:29:45,415
How did you do that?

1051
01:29:50,927 --> 01:29:51,962
Ethan.

1052
01:29:54,764 --> 01:29:55,799
Ethan!

1053
01:29:59,477 --> 01:30:03,015
Nigel, you are wonderful.

1054
01:30:03,690 --> 01:30:06,102
Pure genius.

1055
01:30:07,485 --> 01:30:09,101
You deserve...

1056
01:30:09,738 --> 01:30:10,978
...me.

1057
01:30:34,346 --> 01:30:36,212
And something else.

1058
01:30:42,312 --> 01:30:46,146
Now, let's get out of this dump.

1059
01:30:48,026 --> 01:30:49,866
Did you see this thing?
Look at this!</i>

1060
01:30:50,362 --> 01:30:52,148
Hey, what's the matter?
Catchin' flies?

1061
01:30:52,364 --> 01:30:54,071
Lucy, look.

1062
01:30:56,701 --> 01:30:58,701
<i>One minute nothing.
The next minute this.</i>

1063
01:30:58,870 --> 01:31:00,201
<i>What is it?</i>

1064
01:31:02,082 --> 01:31:04,198
<i>It's</i> a <i>mountain, Lucy.
Isn't it?</i>

1065
01:31:04,417 --> 01:31:06,033
<i>Tell me I'm not seeing things.</i>

1066
01:31:06,252 --> 01:31:07,521
<i>How did it get there, Jimmy?</i>

1067
01:31:07,545 --> 01:31:09,206
<i>I</i> don't <i>know.</i>
It just appeared.

1068
01:31:09,464 --> 01:31:11,375
<i>How can a
mountain just appear?</i>

1069
01:31:11,967 --> 01:31:13,924
<i>Hey, there's something
on the top.</i>

1070
01:31:14,678 --> 01:31:16,385
<i>Looks like a castle.</i>

1071
01:31:16,596 --> 01:31:18,257
<i>Looks more like a fortress.</i>

1072
01:32:07,397 --> 01:32:08,397
Ethan?

1073
01:32:15,739 --> 01:32:16,739
Ethan.

1074
01:32:48,980 --> 01:32:50,186
Ethan!

1075
01:32:50,899 --> 01:32:52,139
Ah.

1076
01:33:17,717 --> 01:33:20,550
Enjoy your prison, Supergirl...

1077
01:33:21,721 --> 01:33:25,259
...forever and ever.

1078
01:33:28,853 --> 01:33:30,764
No, Ethan!

1079
01:33:31,064 --> 01:33:32,725
Don't do it!

1080
01:33:33,358 --> 01:33:34,564
<i>Ethan!</i>

1081
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:06,986
Where am I?

1082
01:36:28,032 --> 01:36:30,023
<i>You can't arrest
me without a warrant.</i>

1083
01:36:31,369 --> 01:36:32,780
I'm calling my lawyer.

1084
01:36:41,504 --> 01:36:42,504
Slow down.

1085
01:36:42,547 --> 01:36:44,083
<i>We want Selena out.</i>

1086
01:36:45,758 --> 01:36:47,749
Smile, lunkhead.
You're not a gardener anymore.

1087
01:36:47,969 --> 01:36:49,676
You're Prince Ethan, now.

1088
01:36:49,929 --> 01:36:51,886
Are we gonna stand up
to her or not?

1089
01:36:52,098 --> 01:36:53,098
Yes.

1090
01:36:53,224 --> 01:36:54,339
Selena must go!

1091
01:36:54,559 --> 01:36:56,175
Who's this little twerpette?

1092
01:36:56,394 --> 01:36:58,055
She's someone
who believes in freedom.

1093
01:36:58,313 --> 01:37:00,153
Lucy, it's not a good time
to express yourself.

1094
01:37:00,315 --> 01:37:02,101
<i>I don't know, who you are.</i>

1095
01:37:02,317 --> 01:37:03,899
Or what evil force
you represent.

1096
01:37:04,110 --> 01:37:07,228
But if you think you can get rid
of anybody who stands up to you.

1097
01:37:07,447 --> 01:37:10,280
Just make them disappear.
Like my friend Linda.

1098
01:37:10,950 --> 01:37:11,950
Who?

1099
01:37:12,076 --> 01:37:13,111
Linda, my roommate.

1100
01:37:13,328 --> 01:37:15,365
She disappeared the day
that mountain showed up.

1101
01:37:17,707 --> 01:37:19,573
The wimp.

1102
01:37:21,294 --> 01:37:22,876
Seize them!

1103
01:37:25,548 --> 01:37:26,754
<i>Leave her alone!</i>

1104
01:37:26,966 --> 01:37:28,127
<i>Drive off.</i>

1105
01:37:28,384 --> 01:37:29,874
Leave her alone.

1106
01:37:30,219 --> 01:37:32,051
Nobody messes around
with Jimmy Olsen!

1107
01:37:32,263 --> 01:37:34,880
Now, let go of me.
I'm with the press!

1108
01:38:49,799 --> 01:38:51,039
Zaltar.

1109
01:38:51,259 --> 01:38:52,259
Squirt.

1110
01:38:55,096 --> 01:38:57,884
- Zaltar?
- Squirt.

1111
01:39:00,143 --> 01:39:02,931
Zaltar, it's me.
It's-it's Kara.

1112
01:39:03,146 --> 01:39:04,352
I know.

1113
01:39:06,607 --> 01:39:08,018
Squirt.

1114
01:39:13,197 --> 01:39:14,733
What is that?

1115
01:39:16,033 --> 01:39:17,489
Where are we?

1116
01:39:17,702 --> 01:39:19,238
Nowhere.

1117
01:39:22,290 --> 01:39:23,655
The Phantom Zone?

1118
01:39:23,958 --> 01:39:26,245
It's lonely here, my Kara.

1119
01:39:27,545 --> 01:39:28,831
So sad.

1120
01:39:31,549 --> 01:39:35,258
I've been here forever
and I shall stay here forever.

1121
01:39:38,139 --> 01:39:39,800
<i>- Ethan'?
- Yes, my damn'.</i>

1122
01:39:40,016 --> 01:39:42,758
Don't call me your "darling."
You despise me.

1123
01:39:42,977 --> 01:39:45,184
- Get me the coffer of shadow.
- Yes, my darling.

1124
01:39:46,105 --> 01:39:47,105
Now...

1125
01:39:48,900 --> 01:39:52,018
...I think we need something.

1126
01:39:54,489 --> 01:39:55,489
<i>There.</i>

1127
01:40:00,578 --> 01:40:01,578
Oh, Jimmy.

1128
01:40:02,955 --> 01:40:04,491
Oh, terrific.

1129
01:40:04,707 --> 01:40:08,041
The old dangling-in-a-cage
routine.

1130
01:40:08,252 --> 01:40:10,334
Pathetic, Selena.

1131
01:40:12,131 --> 01:40:14,839
- Who's that guy?
- He's my math teacher, I think.

1132
01:40:15,051 --> 01:40:16,337
What are they for?

1133
01:40:17,094 --> 01:40:18,801
Insurance.

1134
01:40:24,477 --> 01:40:26,013
But you can't just give up.

1135
01:40:26,229 --> 01:40:28,266
You founded a whole city.

1136
01:40:28,481 --> 01:40:31,189
I did, and then
I doomed it to destruction.

1137
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:33,641
That was an error.
A tragic one.

1138
01:40:34,445 --> 01:40:35,981
When you're my age
and you make as many

1139
01:40:36,197 --> 01:40:38,985
tragic errors as I do,
it is a different tune

1140
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:40,200
that you will sing.

1141
01:40:40,368 --> 01:40:42,234
I will not.
I'll never give up.

1142
01:40:42,453 --> 01:40:44,990
I will never spend my entire
life in a place like this.

1143
01:40:45,248 --> 01:40:47,615
- I would die first!
- Strong words.

1144
01:40:47,833 --> 01:40:51,542
There are worse things than
dying and I deserve every one.

1145
01:41:08,521 --> 01:41:12,185
- What is this?
- A horse... I think.

1146
01:41:13,317 --> 01:41:17,276
On earth I think
it's called a horse.

1147
01:41:17,989 --> 01:41:20,151
- And you made this here?
- Mm.

1148
01:41:23,077 --> 01:41:25,535
- Then you haven't given up.
- Don't be ridiculous.

1149
01:41:25,788 --> 01:41:28,029
Earth, Zaltar.
Earth, a tree, a horse.

1150
01:41:28,249 --> 01:41:29,660
You keep making things
from earth.

1151
01:41:29,875 --> 01:41:32,082
- The place intrigues me.
- Well, then, let's go there.

1152
01:41:32,295 --> 01:41:34,627
Certainly.
When is the next train?

1153
01:41:36,132 --> 01:41:37,463
What is a train?

1154
01:41:40,761 --> 01:41:43,924
What's so funny?
Don't laugh at me, Zaltar.

1155
01:41:45,224 --> 01:41:46,931
I'm only laughing at myself.

1156
01:41:47,143 --> 01:41:49,805
For you, I weep.

1157
01:41:51,063 --> 01:41:52,849
Is this train a way out of here?

1158
01:41:53,065 --> 01:41:55,477
There is no way out of here.

1159
01:41:56,152 --> 01:41:58,644
That is the point
of the Phantom Zone.

1160
01:41:59,071 --> 01:42:02,029
My neighbors now: The criminals,
the corrupt, the evil...

1161
01:42:02,241 --> 01:42:03,276
...they're here.

1162
01:42:03,492 --> 01:42:05,074
Over the hill there.

1163
01:42:05,286 --> 01:42:06,947
With no way out.

1164
01:42:07,830 --> 01:42:11,323
But, there's always a way out.

1165
01:42:11,542 --> 01:42:14,204
<i>If there's a way in,
there's a way out.</i>

1166
01:42:17,298 --> 01:42:18,959
There is a way.

1167
01:42:20,301 --> 01:42:22,713
- But it's impossible.
- Why?

1168
01:42:22,928 --> 01:42:24,919
No, it wouldn't work.

1169
01:42:25,139 --> 01:42:26,504
<i>You'd be swept into
a singularity</i>

1170
01:42:26,724 --> 01:42:28,010
if it didn't work. No.

1171
01:42:28,768 --> 01:42:31,385
Forget I mentioned it.
Have a squirt instead.

1172
01:42:36,609 --> 01:42:38,316
I could do it.

1173
01:42:41,447 --> 01:42:44,155
Then, please.
At least teach me how.

1174
01:42:44,367 --> 01:42:46,278
There's nothing to teach.
You can't, as they say

1175
01:42:46,535 --> 01:42:51,075
practice at the rift.
You get one chance only.

1176
01:42:51,791 --> 01:42:54,453
- The rift?
- Sure? You won't have a squirt?

1177
01:42:54,710 --> 01:42:57,828
Once you get used to it,
I think it's delicious.

1178
01:43:04,345 --> 01:43:05,551
You're right.

1179
01:43:06,597 --> 01:43:09,214
You are absolutely right.

1180
01:43:12,228 --> 01:43:15,266
There is enough doom
and gloom in the air already.

1181
01:43:15,481 --> 01:43:17,688
And it is better
to accept defeat

1182
01:43:17,900 --> 01:43:20,392
than to take a chance and try
like fools to redeem ourselves

1183
01:43:20,695 --> 01:43:23,153
<i>and save our city and all those
who we love there.</i>

1184
01:43:23,364 --> 01:43:25,571
Plus all the people on Earth
that this wicked sorceress

1185
01:43:25,825 --> 01:43:28,613
is going to make suffer
just because of us. Cheers!

1186
01:43:33,207 --> 01:43:34,868
We could die trying.

1187
01:43:36,293 --> 01:43:37,875
But we won't.

1188
01:43:38,462 --> 01:43:40,544
We won't. Come on.

1189
01:44:08,784 --> 01:44:10,149
Tomorrow.

1190
01:44:10,578 --> 01:44:13,445
Thursday. Friday.

1191
01:44:13,664 --> 01:44:16,031
Just like here, we go
for the cops first, right?

1192
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:17,911
And the army.

1193
01:44:18,127 --> 01:44:21,085
By Saturday, we have
the continental United States,

1194
01:44:21,297 --> 01:44:23,254
Mexico, Canada.

1195
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:29,548
<i>Oh, my God, Selena.
It's the box.</i>

1196
01:44:29,764 --> 01:44:32,005
- Hush it up.
- No.

1197
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:36,343
What the box wants,
the box gets.

1198
01:44:52,620 --> 01:44:53,951
What is it?

1199
01:44:54,163 --> 01:44:55,824
Fascinating.

1200
01:44:58,667 --> 01:45:00,249
I don't know.

1201
01:45:01,962 --> 01:45:03,373
ls this it?

1202
01:45:03,589 --> 01:45:04,750
Is this the way out?

1203
01:45:04,965 --> 01:45:08,708
Not yet! This
is the Quantum Vortex!

1204
01:45:09,428 --> 01:45:12,341
We must risk
our destruction in it.

1205
01:45:12,890 --> 01:45:17,225
To move mountains,
you must make sacrifices.

1206
01:45:17,436 --> 01:45:19,347
Zaltar, I'm scared!

1207
01:45:19,730 --> 01:45:22,222
Accept your fears.

1208
01:45:22,525 --> 01:45:24,641
Confront your demons.

1209
01:45:24,944 --> 01:45:28,482
Find your destiny
in the maelstrom!

1210
01:46:18,914 --> 01:46:21,121
Zaltar, I can't.
I can't.

1211
01:46:21,333 --> 01:46:24,371
You... can!

1212
01:46:49,194 --> 01:46:51,435
Two specks.
Look!

1213
01:46:57,745 --> 01:46:59,281
What do I do?

1214
01:47:00,331 --> 01:47:03,665
How do you murder someone
in the Phantom Zone?

1215
01:47:07,796 --> 01:47:10,629
She's with some old guy,
it looks like.

1216
01:47:10,841 --> 01:47:13,424
Move, huh.
Come on!

1217
01:47:13,636 --> 01:47:15,218
Calm down, okay.

1218
01:47:15,763 --> 01:47:19,506
Ah. This is what I want.

1219
01:47:20,768 --> 01:47:23,556
The Salian Fireballs.

1220
01:47:23,771 --> 01:47:27,730
<i>Page 321. Chapter 6.</i>

1221
01:47:42,748 --> 01:47:43,748
Whoa!

1222
01:47:44,959 --> 01:47:46,449
What is that?

1223
01:47:50,965 --> 01:47:52,251
Watch out!

1224
01:48:20,244 --> 01:48:21,860
"Power of Rainmaking". No!

1225
01:48:22,079 --> 01:48:23,439
"How to separate
husband and wife."

1226
01:48:23,622 --> 01:48:25,112
No, not now.
Not now!

1227
01:48:25,332 --> 01:48:28,199
Well, you better find something
fast, like an atom bomb.

1228
01:48:40,264 --> 01:48:41,299
I found it.

1229
01:48:43,183 --> 01:48:47,802
"Summoning... the demon storm."

1230
01:48:48,022 --> 01:48:50,354
Hurry... go,

1231
01:48:50,566 --> 01:48:53,900
Higher girl, higher.

1232
01:48:54,111 --> 01:48:58,070
- Come with me!
- I am with you!

1233
01:48:58,282 --> 01:48:59,772
On, girl.

1234
01:49:12,629 --> 01:49:14,495
I am with you.

1235
01:49:18,427 --> 01:49:20,043
Zaltar!

1236
01:50:13,565 --> 01:50:14,930
Oh, thank God.

1237
01:50:18,570 --> 01:50:21,904
You've had your fun, Selena.
The game is finished.

1238
01:50:22,116 --> 01:50:23,402
Hardly.

1239
01:50:23,617 --> 01:50:26,700
One false step, bluebird.

1240
01:50:26,912 --> 01:50:31,076
And even if you don't,
your friends will get the point.

1241
01:50:33,877 --> 01:50:35,242
He)', no!

1242
01:50:42,678 --> 01:50:43,678
I don't like this.

1243
01:50:44,346 --> 01:50:46,553
Don't worry, Lucy.
Don't worry.

1244
01:50:48,559 --> 01:50:50,550
I wouldn't if I were you.

1245
01:50:50,769 --> 01:50:53,136
Well, you're not me.

1246
01:50:59,778 --> 01:51:01,064
- On!
'Ah!

1247
01:51:01,697 --> 01:51:04,405
Quick, get out of the way.
Into the alcove over there.

1248
01:51:04,616 --> 01:51:06,983
- Come on, out.
- Hurry, Jimmy. Hurry.

1249
01:51:10,998 --> 01:51:13,535
The Omegahedron, Selena.

1250
01:51:13,750 --> 01:51:15,161
I want it.

1251
01:51:15,460 --> 01:51:20,079
Well, then, Supergirl.
You shall have it.

1252
01:51:45,199 --> 01:51:46,199
Ah!

1253
01:51:53,332 --> 01:51:54,332
Ah!

1254
01:52:06,053 --> 01:52:07,885
Supergirl, above you.
Look out!

1255
01:52:12,392 --> 01:52:13,392
Ah!

1256
01:52:22,110 --> 01:52:25,523
I think I'll be going.
If you'll excuse me.

1257
01:52:30,786 --> 01:52:33,369
That's what I said.
I'm staying, I'm staying.

1258
01:52:47,386 --> 01:52:49,673
You have no friends, Selena.

1259
01:52:49,888 --> 01:52:52,220
You treat everyone as if
they were put on this earth

1260
01:52:52,432 --> 01:52:53,888
to serve you.

1261
01:52:54,518 --> 01:52:56,509
More or less, I think they were.

1262
01:52:57,604 --> 01:52:59,595
You included.

1263
01:53:02,985 --> 01:53:05,067
Power of shadow.

1264
01:53:05,487 --> 01:53:07,398
Appear!

1265
01:53:28,635 --> 01:53:30,546
Power of shadow...

1266
01:53:33,015 --> 01:53:35,757
...destroy her!

1267
01:54:15,932 --> 01:54:16,967
Ah!

1268
01:54:17,184 --> 01:54:18,184
Oh!

1269
01:54:31,531 --> 01:54:33,898
I... can't.

1270
01:54:35,452 --> 01:54:37,443
I can't!

1271
01:54:37,662 --> 01:54:39,903
<i>You</i> can!

1272
01:54:41,750 --> 01:54:43,991
<i>On, girl.</i>

1273
01:54:53,095 --> 01:54:54,130
Yes!

1274
01:55:04,314 --> 01:55:06,897
Confront her with it!
It's the only way!

1275
01:55:22,624 --> 01:55:23,864
O-oh!

1276
01:55:37,931 --> 01:55:39,547
No! No! No!

1277
01:55:50,193 --> 01:55:51,604
<i>Argh!</i>

1278
01:56:29,524 --> 01:56:30,524
Oh!

1279
01:56:31,151 --> 01:56:32,482
I have to go.

1280
01:56:32,694 --> 01:56:34,480
I have to return this
to where it belongs.

1281
01:56:34,738 --> 01:56:36,228
<i>And I must
ask you all something.</i>

1282
01:56:36,448 --> 01:56:39,406
It's alright, Supergirl.
We never saw you.

1283
01:56:39,618 --> 01:56:41,108
We never even heard of you.

1284
01:56:41,495 --> 01:56:42,610
Thank you.

1285
01:56:43,163 --> 01:56:45,074
<i>Ethan, Linda, she...</i>

1286
01:56:45,290 --> 01:56:47,406
Well, she had to leave
in a hurry, but she...

1287
01:56:47,626 --> 01:56:49,287
You don't have to say a word.

1288
01:56:50,128 --> 01:56:51,368
I know.

1289
01:56:57,427 --> 01:56:59,338
I'll explain about Linda.

1290
01:57:00,931 --> 01:57:02,296
Thank you, Ethan.

1291
01:57:03,725 --> 01:57:05,341
Take care of yourself, kiddo.

1292
01:57:28,708 --> 01:57:31,666
Wow!
That was some kiss.

1293
01:57:31,878 --> 01:57:32,878
Wow!

1294
01:57:35,423 --> 01:57:37,039
Goodbye, Linda.
