[men grunting]

00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:12,470
[man] Go, go!

[triumphant music playing on tape]

[men panting]

5
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:27,110
-Which way?
-Wait.

[rockets whistling]

[men choking]

10
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,853
[Gordon] General, you were the ones
who let Walker operate

11
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:03,271
right under your noses.

12
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:05,690
Now you're telling me
she evaded capture?

13
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,776
[General on radio]
<i>I understand your frustration.</i>

14
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:10,236
[Gordon] Have you at least determined
why she did what she did?

15
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,738
[General] <i>Not yet.</i>

16
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:13,782
Look, bottom line,

17
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:16,201
Walker and Dorrance
are out of the picture.

18
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:18,411
What else is standing
in the way of reunification?

19
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:22,248
<i>Nothing. I'm recommending
we begin the process immediately.</i>

20
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:25,543
There have been a lot of promises
from across the river.

21
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:29,506
<i>But unlike Walker, or whoever she is,
I have the authority to take action.</i>

22
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,425
<i>Unless something happens
to destabilize Gotham again,</i>

23
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,427
<i>this nightmare is about to end.</i>

24
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:36,387
[Harvey]<i>Think he's for real?</i>

25
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:37,931
I'll believe it when it happens.

26
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:40,225
I take it your search party
didn't find Alfred.

27
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:41,726
[Harvey] Neither hide nor hair.

28
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:45,355
Pennyworth vanished five days ago.
It ain't looking good.

29
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:46,689
[Gordon] How's Bruce?

30
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,734
He's been pulling double shifts
on the search parties.

31
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,569
Kid's dead on his feet.

32
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,159
I want to search this area next.

33
00:01:58,243 --> 00:01:59,869
There are whole blocks
of abandoned buildings.

34
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:00,995
I'll get a squad right on it.

35
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,122
Give me five minutes, I'll be ready.

36
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:03,331
No.

37
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:05,291
-You're not going out.
-No, Jim.

38
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,335
You need your rest.
I'm not cutting you out,

39
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,295
but I need you sharp,
not a liability.

40
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,760
I just don't understand
what could've happened.

41
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:17,387
Neither do I.

42
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,849
But I know that Alfred Pennyworth
can take care of himself.

43
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,269
I'll send for you if I hear anything.

44
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,570
-Kid's tough.
-Yeah.

45
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,197
In other goodish news,
Harper radioed.

46
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,199
-Her squad found something.
-What?

47
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,369
It's weird.

48
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,788
-[camera shutter clicks]
-[siren chirps]

49
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:44,998
[Harper] Four men.

50
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,542
Looks like they breathed in
some sort of chemical agent.

51
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:48,877
I'm thinking airborne.

52
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,087
And the Z's on their bodies?

53
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:53,089
Carved into them
before the time of death.

54
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:54,632
Check out the mustache.

55
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,217
[Gordon grunts]

56
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,387
Fake.

57
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,347
Seems like they escaped from here.

58
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,685
[Gordon] A film set.

59
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:06,936
[Harper] I said it was weird.

60
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,731
[Harvey] The Z's on their chest...

61
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,983
You think it could be Zsasz?

62
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:15,153
No, chemicals aren't really his MO.

63
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:17,697
Plus, I never figured Zsasz
for much of a cinephile.

64
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:20,408
But whoever it is,
if they have more of these chemicals

65
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,701
and the will to use them...

66
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,202
It's bye-bye, reunification.

67
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,581
We gotta stop 'em
before news reaches the mainland.

68
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:29,918
The Chessmen.

69
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,754
It's a gang that operates
out of The Narrows.

70
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,048
So what the hell is a Narrows
gang doing way up here?

71
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:37,217
I think we both know
someone we can ask.

72
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,595
-[footsteps approaching]
-[woman laughing]

73
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,583
Can you check on the fever in bed 12?

74
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,169
What's up, Doc?
Heard you were working here.

75
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,378
Interesting.

76
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:38,880
It's what I do, help people.

77
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:41,299
Speaking of which, I've got patients.

78
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:44,635
Oh, you wouldn't kick Jim's baby mama
to the curb, now, would you?

79
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,679
Whatever happened between
you and Jim,

80
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:49,015
it's none of my concern.
So, if you're here to gloat--

81
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:52,393
I'm here for medical assistance,
for my little nugget.

82
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,271
What do you say? Be my OB?

83
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:56,814
You can't be serious.

84
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,399
I know we've had our differences.

85
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,444
You tried to kill me, Barbara. Twice.

86
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,738
-That was years ago.
-[sighs]

87
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:05,114
There are other doctors here.

88
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,616
Not as good as you.

89
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:10,453
Look, whatever you think of me,
my child is innocent

90
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:13,539
and I want the best for it.
And in this place, that means you.

91
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,793
[sighs]

92
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:20,004
-Does Jim know you're here?
-This is none of his business.

93
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:21,506
[Gordon] Lee.

94
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:25,885
Jim.

95
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:28,930
Barbara.

96
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:31,724
You're interrupting.
Doctor-patient. Blow.

97
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,977
-I'm sorry. You're her doctor?
-[Lee] No. I don't know.

98
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,230
Maybe. What are you doing here?

99
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:40,983
Some bodies turned up.
They might have a Narrows connection.

100
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:44,028
-I wouldn't have come, but it's--
-It's important.

101
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,531
You two need to talk.

102
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:49,200
-I'll be outside.
-Uh, I'd rather not.

103
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:53,454
If you want me to your doctor,
you will talk to the baby's father.

104
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,540
Your first appointment is next week.

105
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:57,542
The nurse will give you
all your vitamins when you leave.

106
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:58,918
Deal?

107
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,053
Is she really the only one
you could find?

108
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,347
She's the best doctor
in this hellhole of a city.

109
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,766
-Not everything is about Jim Gordon.
-Pretty sure this one is.

110
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,601
Because we slept together? Yeah.

111
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:18,187
I only told you because
I felt you had a right to know,

112
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,398
but your involvement in this
ended the moment

113
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,567
-you put your pants back on.
-[scoffs]

114
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,737
What?

115
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,323
You don't think I'm fit
to be a mother?

116
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,575
What do you think?

117
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,203
Barbara.

118
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,396
[woman laughing]

119
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,900
[bats squeaking]

120
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,616
[man and woman laughing]

121
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,379
[whispering indistinctly]

122
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,007
[woman laughs]

123
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,012
Who are you?

124
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,182
Well, look who decided to join us.

125
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:37,475
Hello, champ.

126
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,437
[footsteps approaching]

127
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,730
[Alfred] Master Bruce!

128
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:44,524
Alfred, how did you...

129
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:45,900
Look at the state of you.

130
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:48,528
Haven't I told you about
rolling around in the muck?

131
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,990
Alfred, what's going on?
Who are these people?

132
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,534
[man] Whatever do you mean, Bruce?

133
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:56,911
We're your parents.

134
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,706
All right.
Well, let's get you spruced up.

135
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:03,751
After all, we have a guest.

136
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,757
Welcome home, Bruce.

137
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,306
Jeremiah. You're alive.

138
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,392
[laughing]

139
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:23,563
Well, you didn't think Selina could
kill me so easily, did you?

140
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:26,816
[laughing] I just had to
put you off my scent

141
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,735
until I could finalize my project.

142
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,115
Manners, Master Bruce!
Let's not be rude to our guest.

143
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:36,659
Especially when I come bearing gifts.

144
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,870
[Alfred] Oh, Mr. Jeremiah, a cake!

145
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,706
How exceedingly kind of you.

146
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:46,210
-Is it Italian meringue?
-Sure.

147
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,546
-[Alfred] Oh.
-Now, now, Bruce.

148
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:51,132
You come any closer
and I blow up Wayne Manor

149
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:52,550
with all of us inside of it.

150
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:56,596
I have a dozen more
of these, uh, Italian meringues

151
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,848
sprinkled all throughout the house.

152
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,309
What did you do to Alfred?

153
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,686
And who are these people?

154
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,396
I'm glad you asked.

155
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,231
Come. Come, come.

156
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,986
Mommy and Daddy dearest

157
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:15,281
were just an innocent couple
I kidnapped

158
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:18,701
based on bone structure and, um,

159
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,662
build.

160
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:26,292
Just a touch of plastic surgery,
and<i>voilà.</i>

161
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,837
Waynes. [chuckles]

162
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,048
Alfred, I nabbed in the Green Zone.

163
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,258
They're hypnotized.

164
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:37,595
Well, I'm afraid there was
no room for improv in our script.

165
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,099
Today is a very important day, Bruce.

166
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,645
Just look at the way they're dressed.

167
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:51,150
It's the night
my parents were killed.

168
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:56,238
And I'm giving you the chance
to experience it all over again.

169
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,492
Why?

170
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,202
[Jeremiah] Isn't it obvious?

171
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:05,790
Bruce...

172
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:12,171
This... This was the most
important day of your life.

173
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:16,425
And I didn't get to be a part of it.

174
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,471
We need to rectify that.

175
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,807
Alfred, it's time for dinner.

176
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:26,352
Chop-chop, we're on
a very tight schedule.

177
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:28,687
[Alfred] Of course, Mr. Jeremiah.

178
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,746
[explosion]

179
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:49,375
That's zero for three.

180
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:51,544
[Penguin] Yes.

181
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:54,755
Seems the government was quite
thorough when they mined the river.

182
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,966
You didn't have a plan
to get off this rock

183
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,676
before you stole everyone's crap?

184
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,470
I was working on a plan.

185
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,472
[Selina] The river is mined.

186
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:06,183
Everything that flies out
gets blown from...

187
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:08,227
-the sky.
-What?

188
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:12,606
Jeremiah was digging
a tunnel under the river.

189
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:17,611
A tunnel? [scoffs] Really?

190
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,738
Do you have any better ideas?

191
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:22,700
Uh...

192
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,578
Didn't think so.

193
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,663
It's in the Dark Zone.

194
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,874
We should wait until night
to check it out.

195
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,960
Well, I was running out
of guinea pigs anyway.

196
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,174
Oh, look, he's swimming to shore.

197
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,050
[explosion]

198
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,559
[Lee] Are you sure you should be out
in The Narrows alone?

199
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:51,228
[Gordon] When the bridges fell,
this place descended into chaos.

200
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,105
I figure our best bet
of getting out in one piece

201
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,648
is to keep a low profile.

202
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,942
So all the work I did to make
The Narrows better was for nothing.

203
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,777
[clattering]

204
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,655
It's the Leopards,
the rivals of the Chessmen.

205
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:05,451
[indistinct chatter]

206
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:09,288
-About this Barbara thing...
-Jim, just don't.

207
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:11,457
No. It's important to me
that you understand.

208
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:16,378
Okay. So what are you gonna do?

209
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,675
I don't know, but it's my child, too.

210
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,804
Barbara seems to have
a difference in opinion.

211
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,641
Okay, people change.

212
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,184
You don't know her like I do.

213
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,727
You can say that again.

214
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,105
Look.

215
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,442
All clear.

216
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:40,861
The Chessmen moved around.

217
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,905
They used these as signals
for their members.

218
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,449
The rook's a compass needle.
North-northeast.

219
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:46,575
Let's go.

220
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,293
[cutlery clinking]

221
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:06,804
Alfred told me such great tidbits
about your childhood.

222
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,306
How you used to eat here,

223
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:12,309
in the kitchen,
when it was just you and the family.

224
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:16,855
My, how homey and intimate.

225
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:22,945
Grilled cheese and Branston pickle
sandwich, Mr. Jeremiah.

226
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:26,782
Master Bruce's favorite.
My influence, though Thomas did add

227
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:30,077
a dash of aioli for extra flair.

228
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,289
[laughing]

229
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,460
Oh. Come on, Bruce.

230
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:41,380
That's a weird favorite food
for a 12-year-old.

231
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,424
I'm playing your game.

232
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:48,012
Now, let Alfred and these people go.
They're innocent.

233
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,848
I'm sorry, Bruce. It's just...

234
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:56,687
It's very important to me that
I get every detail exactly right.

235
00:14:56,854 --> 00:15:00,190
Speaking of which, the final touch.

236
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,829
What was it like...

237
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,916
losing your parents that night?

238
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:23,047
I lost my family, too, Bruce.

239
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,550
The wound still hasn't healed.

240
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:29,261
I think about it often.

241
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,013
None of this is real.

242
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,851
You're trying to manipulate me.

243
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,439
It will never be real.

244
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:46,070
But you are thinking
about that night...

245
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,989
and that's all I need.

246
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,867
I just want to be connected to you.

247
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:55,120
I offered for you
to be my best friend!

248
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:06,090
But I've realized
if we can't be friends,

249
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:10,844
then we can be connected
in other ways.

250
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:15,432
How?

251
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,603
You'll see...

252
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,481
in time.

253
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,740
Hmm.

254
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,035
I'm sorry to cut tonight short,

255
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:40,374
but your parents and I
have a very important date...

256
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,542
Jeremiah!

257
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,043
-...with destiny.
-[Bruce] Jeremiah!

258
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,338
You might want to find
your faithful butler and leave.

259
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,717
-Quickly.
-[device beeping]

260
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,220
Alfred!

261
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:01,145
[bell tolling in distance]

262
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,275
The signs lead this way.

263
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,569
Look at the smoke.

264
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:10,529
Someone re-started production.

265
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:30,549
[Lee] Oh, my God, Jim.

266
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,303
Look at all of this.

267
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,722
Come on.

268
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,479
Who's in charge here?

269
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:47,483
Ticktock, the chemical stock shall
give our Gotham an aftershock.

270
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:51,195
Ticktock, the chemical stock shall
give our Gotham an aftershock.

271
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:53,113
Ticktock, the chemical stock...

272
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,115
Shall give our Gotham an aftershock.

273
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:57,618
-They've been hypnotized
-It's Tetch.

274
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,995
[clapping]

275
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,251
My, my, what a thrill.

276
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,337
Jim Gordon...

277
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,173
and the woman he told me to kill.

278
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,758
It brings back memories.

279
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,469
That tea party was so long ago.

280
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:19,181
But now, to order
these men to attack my foe.

281
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,307
[Lee grunts]

282
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:24,061
All for one and one for all!

283
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,979
Ain't this a grand old ball?

284
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,148
[men grunting]

285
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,153
[Ecco] Yoo-hoo!

286
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:35,948
Ain't this

287
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,118
some game!

288
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,414
Give it to me again?

289
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,875
[sighs] Penguin has been stealing

290
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,128
everything in the city
that's not nailed down.

291
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,922
And now, he needs a way
of getting it off the island.

292
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:53,257
[Barbara] Hmm.

293
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,218
-And you're helping him?
-Well, that's what he thinks.

294
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,179
Barbara, Tabitha was my friend, too.

295
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:03,183
If anything, I wanna gut the twerp.
And take his loot.

296
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,769
Except you don't actually
have a way of out of Gotham.

297
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:06,937
I'll find one, tonight.

298
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,189
And I'll still need your help
moving the stuff.

299
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,024
We can get out of here, together.

300
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,486
Away from Jim Gordon?

301
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:18,282
Rich as Midas,
Penguin dead in a ditch?

302
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,577
Well, aren't we just
two single ladies and a baby,

303
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,079
about to kill
our sworn enemy together.

304
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,582
What?

305
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,542
It's just, you're pregnant.

306
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,669
-Don't even start.
-[gun clicks]

307
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,090
[Bruce] Alfred!

308
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,675
[beeping]

309
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,218
Alfred!

310
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,138
Alfred!

311
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,140
-We need to get outta here.
-Ah, Master Bruce.

312
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:45,184
I was just taking
a quiet moment to tidy up.

313
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,311
We need to go. The bombs.

314
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:49,396
-What bombs?
-These bombs!

315
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,816
No need for roughhousing, sir.

316
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:56,862
There has to be a way.

317
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,740
Alfred, you would do anything
to protect me, right?

318
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:01,074
Absolutely, sir.

319
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,659
There's a gas leak in the kitchen.

320
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,745
It's only a matter of time
before this whole place goes up.

321
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:06,079
A gas leak?

322
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,623
Where are your parents?
Where's our guests?

323
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:10,209
I've already warned them.
I know a way out. Come on!

324
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,836
[beeping rapidly]

325
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,741
-[Bruce] Alfred!
-[Alfred groans]

326
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,327
Alfred! [grunts]

327
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,914
[grunts] Oh, bloody hell.

328
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,249
Don't move.

329
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,584
-[panting]
-Do you, uh...

330
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,796
Oh, yeah. I remember everything.

331
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,714
Clear as day.

332
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:01,134
Let me tell you, if I ever see
that Jervis Tetch character again,

333
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:04,388
I'll stick that watch
so far up his...

334
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:05,806
His nose.

335
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,058
How about you?

336
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,643
Are you all right?

337
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,104
Yeah, I'm all right.

338
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,523
The manor.

339
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,526
Don't you worry about that now, sir.

340
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:19,653
Come on, help me up.

341
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:21,780
[groaning]

342
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:23,532
Oh, your leg's hurt.

343
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,867
Yes. Well, it's not broken.

344
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:40,048
I thought I lost you.

345
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:41,800
Me?

346
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,220
Never, Master Bruce.

347
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,474
Go on.

348
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,394
You know where he's gonna be at.

349
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,230
Go.

350
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,161
If you're here,

351
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,413
Jeremiah must still be alive.

352
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,917
And if you're here, I'm guessing
you found our test subjects

353
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,879
all boiled and bubbled. [giggling]

354
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:21,548
-What's he planning?
-[Ecco shushing]

355
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:24,051
[Ecco] It's a surprise, don't you know?

356
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,720
A real killer.

357
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:29,973
[Tetch] Shall I hypnotize
our friends here

358
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,600
and have them slit
each other's necks?

359
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,351
[Ecco laughing] Nix.

360
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:34,519
Better check with the boss.

361
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,564
He might have other ideas.

362
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:40,942
[beeps]

363
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,237
I'm sorry I got you involved in this.

364
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,405
Don't be.

365
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,032
I knew what I was
getting myself into.

366
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:49,367
-I know, but, Lee...
-Jim...

367
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:53,622
Whatever you wanna tell me,
save it till we're outta here.

368
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:55,165
Fair enough.

369
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:57,709
I'm gonna find out
what Valeska's planning.

370
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:00,045
Hey, Tetch?

371
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,048
You know, it's funny...

372
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,426
I never figured you
for Jeremiah's errand boy.

373
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,846
Oh, Captain, no errands do I run.

374
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:12,933
This is simply a way
for me to have some fun.

375
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:15,060
[Lee scoffs] Tell yourself that.

376
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:17,854
What are you

377
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,774
when you would take away
your games and your rhymes?

378
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:23,235
Nothing but a second-rater
with a really silly hat.

379
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:25,320
Shut up.

380
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:27,155
[whispering indistinctly]

381
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:30,075
-[laughing]
-Beautiful. Beautiful.

382
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:34,913
[Tetch] Lee Thompkins,
you do intrigue me so.

383
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:38,375
First, you were a doctor.

384
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,919
Then The Narrows' queen.

385
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:43,255
-Tell me, please do.
-[watch ticking]

386
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:45,882
Are you running from your past

387
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,009
when you become someone new?

388
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:56,893
[lock clicking]

389
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:12,242
When I found Jeremiah,

390
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:14,953
he had a bunch of crazies
digging this tunnel for him.

391
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:18,540
[exhales] Well, that certainly
fills me with confidence.

392
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,917
Whoa. You hear that?

393
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:23,211
-[footsteps approaching]
-[gasps]

394
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:26,047
[panting]

395
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,136
-Alfred?
-[Alfred] Selina?

396
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,346
What are you doing here?

397
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:35,348
And with that?

398
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:39,186
I should ask you the same thing.
What's down that tunnel?

399
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:41,479
Well, it was Wayne Manor,
till Jeremiah blew it up.

400
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:44,316
He sealed the only way out of Gotham.

401
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,943
[stammering] No, Jeremiah is not alive.

402
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:49,112
I saw him die, right here.

403
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:50,530
Yeah, well, you're wrong.

404
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,324
We all were.

405
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:54,993
And now, he's embarked
on some madcap scheme,

406
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:57,370
where he's reenacting the night
Bruce's parent's were killed.

407
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:58,705
Where's Bruce?

408
00:24:58,788 --> 00:24:59,998
He's gone after Jeremiah.

409
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:02,959
He could use your help.

410
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,298
-Wait!
-Don't you think

411
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:12,302
that because I did not kill Jeremiah
does not mean that I won't kill you!

412
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:13,678
Selina...

413
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:16,890
You killed my friend Tabitha.

414
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,601
You deserve to die.

415
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,102
[Alfred] Selina.

416
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,813
Just put the knife down.

417
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,275
Bruce needs you.

418
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,113
[gasping]

419
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,168
I suppose I should thank you.

420
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,755
Well, you could help me
to the Green Zone.

421
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:51,883
Of course, it's that way.

422
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,902
Jeremiah!

423
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,655
Show yourself!

424
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,740
[dramatic music playing]

425
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,050
[music continues]

426
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:42,851
Olé!

427
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,020
Hola,<i>Bruce.</i>

428
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:47,564
<i>Well, here we are,</i>

429
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:51,609
<i>the theater where
your mommy and daddy took you to see</i>

430
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:54,404
The Mark of Zorro.

431
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:56,281
<i>Ha-ha!</i>

432
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:58,950
<i>I had heard you were obsessed
with this man as a child.</i>

433
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:01,995
<i>I wonder what it was that
intrigued you so.</i>

434
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:05,498
<i>Was it the fact that he struck fear
into the heart of his enemy?</i>

435
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,212
<i>En garde!</i>

436
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,382
[grunting] <i>Take that!</i>

437
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,510
<i>Vagabond.</i>

438
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,637
-[grunting]
-[screaming]

439
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,894
[screams]

440
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:29,314
<i>But...</i>

441
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:33,610
<i>Perhaps the movie
was a bit too effective.</i>

442
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:38,365
<i>Isn't this the part where
you became frightened?</i>

443
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:41,284
<i>When you asked your parents to leave?</i>

444
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:44,996
<i>I wonder what would have happened
if you hadn't done that.</i>

445
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,249
<i>If you had conquered your fear.</i>

446
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:51,461
<i>Maybe your parents
would still be alive.</i>

447
00:27:57,425 --> 00:28:03,139
<i>Well, on to the last and final stop
down memory lane.</i>

448
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,939
[Bruce] Stop!

449
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,191
Stop!

450
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:14,943
That's far enough, Bruce.

451
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,528
[Bruce] Jeremiah!

452
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:19,406
-You don't have to do this!
-But I...

453
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:22,033
I do.

454
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:26,287
See, I came to this realization.

455
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:31,126
I realized that no matter
what I did to bond us,

456
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,461
some random gunman in an alley

457
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:36,256
would be the man
who you were tied to the most.

458
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:39,884
The man you saw
when you closed your eyes.

459
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:44,139
I want to be the star of the show!

460
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:49,602
So, if I can't have you
as a brother bonded by love...

461
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,688
[gun cocks]

462
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:54,607
Then we'll just have
to be bonded by hatred.

463
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:58,820
And you think killing two people that
look like my parents will do that?

464
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:00,655
It won't.

465
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,240
Well, it's a good thing I already

466
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:05,285
put a bullet in both of
their fraudulent skulls.

467
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:08,705
Oh, you're confused.

468
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:10,874
You're wondering
if I already shot them,

469
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:14,294
then who's this lovely couple?

470
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,839
Thomas, Martha.

471
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:20,842
Why don't you turn around?

472
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,690
-Jim!
-[Jeremiah laughing]

473
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:37,859
I know!

474
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:41,446
See, over the course
of our little adventures,

475
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:43,948
fate brought to me James Gordon

476
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:47,202
and Leslie Thompkins,
and I thought to myself...

477
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:51,039
Why not...

478
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:56,377
Why not kill the man who you think of
as your second father figure?

479
00:29:56,711 --> 00:30:02,008
And your dear, dear,
dear friend, Lee Thompkins.

480
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:05,428
And when I do,

481
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:08,473
finally you and I
will be bound together.

482
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,391
-[vehicle approaching]
-'Cause, you see...

483
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,352
[horn honking rhythmically]

484
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:19,692
Reunification with the mainland
hangs on by a thread.

485
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,611
Those fireworks go off,

486
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:24,572
and toxic chemicals
rain down onto the city

487
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:28,159
and the government [clicks tongue]
cuts us adrift for good.

488
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,793
[Bruce] Jeremiah...

489
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:38,378
don't.

490
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,629
Shhh.

491
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:42,048
And the pièce de résistance.

492
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:44,759
One last thing.

493
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,595
I had Jervis Tetch hypnotize them

494
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,681
so that they'll wake up
the moment these

495
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,809
beautiful pearls hit the ground.

496
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,688
I want you to see them realize
what I've done to them

497
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:59,607
as the life drains from their bodies.

498
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:02,569
Never forget.

499
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,029
This is all for you, Bruce.

500
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:07,448
No!

501
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,910
-[grunts]
-[punching]

502
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:13,371
[beeping]

503
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:15,915
Selina, the pearls!

504
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:26,634
-[Bruce groans]
-No!

505
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:30,013
[Jeremiah] Ecco! Now!

506
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,681
[beeping]

507
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,439
We need to stop the fireworks,
they're gonna--

508
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:40,607
I know.

509
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,942
You go after Jeremiah and Ecco.
I'll take the truck.

510
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:44,485
[beeping]

511
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,282
There's no way to stop them all.

512
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:51,492
Get to Harvey.

513
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:54,829
Warn the people in the Green Zone
to get to cover.

514
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:56,539
[Lee] Jim!

515
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,291
Jim!

516
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:08,051
Jeremiah!

517
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,761
Face me!

518
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:12,096
Here, Bruce!

519
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,290
[beeping rapidly]

520
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:54,597
[Bruce] Jeremiah!

521
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,560
This ends tonight.

522
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:03,898
No, no, Bruce. Now it begins. [laughs]

523
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,985
[both grunting]

524
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,418
[Jeremiah] Yes. [chuckles]

525
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,794
You feel it.

526
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:26,921
-The connection between us.
-[Bruce grunting]

527
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,881
[Jeremiah] You do.

528
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,633
Don't you?

529
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:32,135
Bruce, do you feel it?

530
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,595
Tell me you feel it. [groans]

531
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:39,434
You mean nothing to me.

532
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:46,149
Why don't you understand?

533
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:47,483
[both grunting]

534
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:50,903
You need me!

535
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:54,282
I'm the answer
to your life's question.

536
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:57,744
Without me, you're just a joke...

537
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:02,957
Without a punchline.

538
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,224
-[seagulls squawking]
-[bell tolling in distance]

539
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:07,897
After all this time,
you've come to me for help?

540
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:12,068
After allowing Strange
to put a chip into my brain?

541
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,861
Attempting to sell me out to Gordon?

542
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:19,575
And after naming a dog after me?

543
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:24,288
First of all,
I am very fond of that dog.

544
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:29,627
Secondly, I had Hugo Strange
save your life.

545
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:33,464
Thirdly, do you really think
I didn't have plans

546
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:36,759
to save you from Jim Gordon?

547
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:38,302
[laughing]

548
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,848
You always have an answer
for everything, don't you, Oswald?

549
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:46,602
We have been through
all of this before.

550
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:50,231
I've tried to kill you,
you've tried to kill me.

551
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:55,653
But here we are,
in this room, together.

552
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:59,907
It means fate
has different plans for us.

553
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:06,581
What are these plans?

554
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,667
Haven't you realized
what Gotham is yet?

555
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,545
It is no longer a city.

556
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:14,714
It is a prison.

557
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:18,301
And I think it's time we escaped.

558
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:34,984
You heard the news?

559
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:36,777
Everybody's talking about it.

560
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:39,113
Reunification isn't happening.

561
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:41,699
Word of the chemical spill
reached the mainland.

562
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:45,411
No action until the government
can determine if Gotham is safe.

563
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:47,830
I figure at least a couple of months.

564
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:50,666
You don't sound surprised.

565
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:53,044
'Cause I'm not.

566
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:57,381
Could've been much worse.
You stopped that.

567
00:36:57,757 --> 00:37:00,760
[sighs] Every time I think
we're turning things around,

568
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:02,887
I look up, we're right back
where we started.

569
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:18,277
What were you about to say to me
when, uh, Tetch had us?

570
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:25,368
I don't know.

571
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:29,121
I guess I, uh, would have said...

572
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,042
what I said the last time
we saw each other.

573
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:38,464
I wish I could go back,

574
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:43,803
do things differently, better.

575
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:50,226
That feels like a long time ago.

576
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:51,894
Nothing's changed.

577
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:54,063
But it has, Jim.

578
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:57,650
That was a mistake.

579
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:58,776
A mistake?

580
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,695
Put yourself in my shoes.

581
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,446
After everything you said,

582
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,449
suddenly you're having a baby
with Barbara, of all people.

583
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:11,163
But it's not just that.

584
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:15,376
You talk about doing things
differently and I keep thinking,

585
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,838
what if we hadn't lost ours?

586
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:28,431
What're you doing here, Lee?

587
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:33,269
I don't know.

588
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,731
I know you've taken on so much and...

589
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,568
And I want
to be understanding, but...

590
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:45,031
you let me down, Jim.

591
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:48,909
I'm sorry.

592
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:57,335
What does that mean? For us?

593
00:38:58,294 --> 00:38:59,337
I don't know.

594
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:05,009
Can't change the past, so I guess
we just have to live with it.

595
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,387
[scoffs]

596
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:29,283
[machine beeping]

597
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:35,581
[Selina] I can't believe
he's still alive.

598
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:39,418
[Bruce] They've been doing scans,
and he has no brain activity.

599
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,463
He's no longer a threat.

600
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:46,550
To either of us.

601
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,601
Thank you for coming to help me.

602
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,691
The night your parents were killed,
I should've done something.

603
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:06,737
Selina, you've done enough.

604
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,247
[thunder rumbling]

605
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:20,209
[Penguin] It's not much, but it's home.

606
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,294
[Barbara] I've been looking
through your treasure trove.

607
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,713
You've been a very naughty boy.

608
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:27,091
[Penguin] Barbara? How did you...

609
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:30,052
Selina.

610
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:31,303
Hmm.

611
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:34,223
She and I were gonna go
murder-halvsies

612
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:35,724
to get you back for Tabitha.

613
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:40,187
But it seems I will have to do
the dirty work myself, as usual.

614
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:41,397
[Nygma] Oh, my God.

615
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:44,775
You're pregnant.

616
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,071
How could you possibly know that?

617
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:50,197
Look at you!

618
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,323
She's glowing.

619
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:53,409
You're glowing.

620
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:55,119
How very observant of you.

621
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:56,579
<i>Adieu,</i> Oswald.

622
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:59,665
Wait! Come with us.

623
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:02,376
What?

624
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:06,380
Yes, I killed Tabitha.

625
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:09,592
You're angry. You want revenge.

626
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:15,181
But do you really want to raise
your child in a toxic waste war zone?

627
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,683
Come with us.

628
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:21,896
Are you telling me
you found a way out of Gotham?

629
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:23,564
Ed did.

630
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:27,735
It's a submarine.

631
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:29,445
A submarine?

632
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:31,947
It can track mines in the river
using sonar.

633
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,202
So, where's this submarine?

634
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,375
We have to build it.

635
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:44,752
Yeah, I'm gonna shoot you.

636
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:46,128
[whimpers]

637
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:49,048
God!

638
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:51,175
What is happening to me?

639
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:52,885
Perhaps--

640
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:55,387
[Barbara] Shut up!
That was a rhetorical question.

641
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:59,016
[sighs]

642
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:04,313
Fine. I won't shoot you,
for the sake of my child.

643
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:07,024
But I will never forgive you.

644
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:10,945
Of course. I understand.

645
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:17,243
[Barbara] Call me when it's done.

646
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:18,577
So, who's the lucky father?

647
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:19,954
[Barbara] Shut up!
