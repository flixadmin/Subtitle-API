1
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:52,172
The usurper.

2
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,333
He seems very confident.

3
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,090
Where's Elio?

4
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:36,633
I'll go down.

5
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,486
Darling, come help Oliver
take his things up to his room.

6
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,988
- He's already here?
- Yes!

7
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:28,935
You're leaving?

8
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,024
Nice to meet you.

9
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,443
I'll take care of the tart.

10
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,441
Let me do it.

11
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,460
Thank you.

12
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:10,550
Peaches, cherries, apricots...

13
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,336
Help yourself, darling.

14
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,712
Thanks.

15
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,241
- Ciao, Romano.
- Ciao, Oliver.

16
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,910
- How are you?
- All good.

17
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,709
Ciao, boys!

18
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,627
All good?

19
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,379
All good!

20
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:02,884
- Can you start please?
- Of course!

21
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:24,822
Good morning, gentlemen.

22
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,876
Go, Chiara!

23
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,221
He's better than the guy
who came last year.

24
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,680
Remember?

25
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:51,599
Get in there!

26
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:54,560
Much better!
See how cute he is.

27
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,782
Elio, water!

28
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:04,380
Sweetheart, Auntie Marcella and
the others are coming over for dinner.

29
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:07,884
Is Oliver staying with us or going out?

30
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,302
Don't know.

31
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,679
What a movie star!

32
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,474
Yes, those Americans...

33
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,707
Sparkling wine!

34
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,043
He's late.

35
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:44,712
Don't you think...

36
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,716
Don't you think he's impolite
when he says, "Later"?

37
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:51,511
Arrogant.

38
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:12,657
Oh, no, sweetheart.

39
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,453
- Take his plates away.
- Very well, madam.

40
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,440
I don't want to.

41
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:48,484
Why not?

42
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,027
Because I don't want to.

43
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:52,446
Why don't you go
to Moscazzano with others?

44
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,240
Because I don't want to.

45
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,586
Play well, darling.

46
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:22,771
Have you been to the river?

47
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,454
Mafalda!

48
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:40,372
Isn't she beautiful?

49
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:36,530
Come here.

50
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:40,284
What's going on?

51
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,161
Is he trying to get it on with her?

52
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:44,413
Elio, he already succeeded?

53
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,749
What do I know?

54
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,501
I'd love to be in his shoes.

55
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:51,503
Who wouldn't love to be in her shoes?

56
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:56,216
She wants him, no matter what!

57
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:41,637
Coming?

58
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,307
I'll come later.

59
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:03,593
Are you with me because
you're mad at Chiara?

60
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:05,345
Why would I be mad at Chiara?

61
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:08,056
Because of him.

62
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,599
Because of who?

63
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,019
Of Oliver.

64
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,906
Turn around.

65
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,381
Meet me here tomorrow night?

66
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,557
Wait for me!

67
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,184
Come on.

68
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:05,215
What are you doing?

69
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:07,217
Going to Lake Garda with my dad.

70
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,302
He wants to show Oliver
where he's dredging.

71
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:11,638
Can you tell him I came by?

72
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,474
He's inside with my dad, helping him.

73
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:19,729
You were amazing last night,
on the dance floor.

74
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:21,690
- He's a good dancer.
- A good dancer.

75
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,735
He's good-looking too.

76
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,989
- Want to get us together?
- No.

77
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,409
Come in.

78
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:44,940
I'll drive today!

79
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:56,618
Anchise, take the afternoon off.

80
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,518
Sammy! Come on!

81
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:18,033
Truce?

82
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:31,035
Sorry, Elio.
I brought some clean clothes.

83
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:37,584
Leave the door open.

84
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,378
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

85
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,616
Come here, darling.

86
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:08,140
I straightened the wheels
and inflated the tires.

87
00:46:08,224 --> 00:46:09,642
Perfect. Thanks.

88
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:05,354
Let's go, American!

89
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:20,679
Good morning, ma'am.

90
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:23,557
Excuse me.

91
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:27,186
Could I ask for a glass of water?

92
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:41,075
"People of Italy!"

93
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:49,083
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

94
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:46,421
So we got the government
of Bettino Craxi...

95
00:57:46,505 --> 00:57:49,049
Because we don't do anything
but talk, talk, talk.

96
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:51,051
Let me speak.

97
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:54,638
We have five parties
that do nothing but fight.

98
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:57,474
Smoke and shut up!
Let them speak, him, her.

99
00:57:57,683 --> 00:58:00,477
I'd like to know what they think too.

100
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:03,438
Annella, what do you think?
A five party government!

101
00:58:03,522 --> 00:58:06,692
Darling, I think
it's the historic compromise...

102
00:58:06,775 --> 00:58:10,862
Don't say that. Compromises are tragic.

103
00:58:10,946 --> 00:58:13,740
You've changed
since you inherited this place.

104
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:15,534
What's that got to do with it?

105
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:17,411
What are you saying?

106
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:19,788
You're mad, darling.

107
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:21,832
You asshole!

108
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:25,794
- She's right.
- And you don't say anything to her.

109
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:28,547
Say something.

110
00:58:28,714 --> 00:58:30,340
You're resigned.

111
00:58:30,424 --> 00:58:33,010
Why don't we talk
about the death of Buñuel?

112
00:58:33,093 --> 00:58:36,138
Buñuel was a genius.

113
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:37,848
- Know him?
- Cinema isn't the answer.

114
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:41,226
Cinema is a mirror of reality
and it's a filter.

115
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:45,063
They broadcast <i>The Phantom of Liberty</i>
with constant interr...

116
00:58:45,147 --> 00:58:47,607
Everyone loves Buñuel!

117
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:49,276
Let's hear his opinion.

118
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:51,820
He doesn't know anything about Italy!

119
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:53,864
Say something. Give us your impression.

120
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:55,574
Do you have an impression?

121
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:57,743
Darling, he's American.

122
00:58:57,826 --> 00:58:59,161
That doesn't mean stupid!

123
00:59:05,167 --> 00:59:07,252
Just stop.

124
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:11,256
I don't give an easy ride
to some politicians.

125
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:14,176
She didn't say that.

126
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:16,219
I'm going to go mad.

127
00:59:16,303 --> 00:59:18,138
What's the matter?

128
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:21,183
What's wrong?

129
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:23,268
It's nothing. It happens all the time.

130
00:59:23,435 --> 00:59:26,563
- Mafalda, ice?
- It's in the fridge.

131
00:59:26,772 --> 00:59:29,316
You get used to absolutely everything.

132
01:00:05,811 --> 01:00:08,897
Don't you realise
you're mixing everything up?

133
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:10,649
What are you talking about?

134
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:13,485
There's no more politics, nothing.
He's left too.

135
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:03,845
You okay?

136
01:02:11,645 --> 01:02:12,979
Are we going out?

137
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:18,318
I don't know if I can go out.
If my mom sees, she'll worry.

138
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:20,487
- She will?
- Yeah, she's a pain.

139
01:02:25,909 --> 01:02:27,410
Where's Oliver?

140
01:02:27,494 --> 01:02:29,037
Don't ask me.

141
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:47,973
Where's Oliver?

142
01:02:48,974 --> 01:02:51,685
- Didn't he go out?
- Would you like a smoothie?

143
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:54,437
No, thank you. We're having dinner soon.

144
01:02:54,521 --> 01:02:55,814
All right.

145
01:02:55,939 --> 01:02:57,232
I'm going out tonight.

146
01:02:57,315 --> 01:03:00,652
- Don't make me worry.
- What are you talking about?

147
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:02,404
This is no good, madam.

148
01:03:02,529 --> 01:03:04,656
- Let him do his own thing.
- Fine.

149
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:06,741
Why's she hassling me? I'm 17.

150
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:08,451
She's worried about you.

151
01:03:13,248 --> 01:03:15,750
You like him, don't you? Oliver?

152
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:18,586
Everyone likes Oliver.

153
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:21,089
I think he likes you too.

154
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:22,465
More than you do.

155
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:26,970
Is that your impression?

156
01:03:27,095 --> 01:03:29,931
- No, he told me.
- When did he say that?

157
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:32,309
A while ago.

158
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:59,127
Mafalda, do you know where Oliver is?

159
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:00,670
I have no idea.

160
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:37,368
This is Craxi.
I draw the center of Craxi...

161
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:54,886
- Hey.
<i>-Hi!</i>

162
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:58,723
It's me. Is that Marzia?

163
01:06:58,806 --> 01:07:00,600
<i>Sure it is! Can't you tell?</i>

164
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:01,726
Sorry.

165
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:23,081
Is that for me?

166
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:25,750
Thanks.

167
01:07:42,433 --> 01:07:44,644
Do you really read a lot?

168
01:07:44,811 --> 01:07:47,480
I love reading too,
but I don't tell anyone.

169
01:07:48,147 --> 01:07:49,732
Why not?

170
01:07:49,857 --> 01:07:51,150
I don't know.

171
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:54,571
I think...

172
01:07:55,113 --> 01:07:57,615
people who read are...

173
01:07:58,241 --> 01:07:59,367
kind of secretive.

174
01:08:00,868 --> 01:08:03,204
They hide who they really are.

175
01:08:04,581 --> 01:08:06,416
Do you hide who you really are?

176
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:08,751
No, not with you.

177
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:10,003
Not with me?

178
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:16,301
Well, maybe a bit.

179
01:08:16,384 --> 01:08:17,802
What do you mean?

180
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:21,472
You know exactly what I mean.

181
01:08:21,598 --> 01:08:23,266
Why do you say that?

182
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:25,018
Why?

183
01:08:27,312 --> 01:08:28,521
Because...

184
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:30,857
I think...

185
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:32,900
you're going to hurt me,

186
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:34,777
and I don't want to be hurt.

187
01:08:51,711 --> 01:08:53,546
You're so hard.

188
01:08:59,886 --> 01:09:01,346
Wait.

189
01:09:01,429 --> 01:09:02,805
Kiss me.

190
01:09:10,438 --> 01:09:11,898
- Is that good?
- Yes.

191
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:14,400
Are you lying?

192
01:09:25,745 --> 01:09:28,581
- Oh, fuck, I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

193
01:09:28,748 --> 01:09:30,875
Are you mad at me? Are you angry?

194
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:44,097
What's so funny? Why are you laughing?

195
01:09:44,931 --> 01:09:46,432
Leave me alone.

196
01:09:47,642 --> 01:09:49,268
Fuck, that felt good.

197
01:10:49,454 --> 01:10:50,663
Not really.

198
01:13:44,629 --> 01:13:46,339
I won't be here for dinner.

199
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:48,174
Okay, Mr Oliver.

200
01:14:20,081 --> 01:14:21,832
Hello, Mafalda.

201
01:14:21,916 --> 01:14:22,917
Marzia.

202
01:14:26,003 --> 01:14:27,338
Where are we going?

203
01:14:27,421 --> 01:14:28,673
You'll see.

204
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:44,897
Stop it!

205
01:17:21,011 --> 01:17:23,013
- How are you, buddy?
- Hey!

206
01:17:23,097 --> 01:17:25,057
- It's been ages.
- It has, yes.

207
01:17:25,808 --> 01:17:27,601
- How are you?
- You've grown.

208
01:17:30,521 --> 01:17:32,565
Remember Marzia from last year.

209
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:33,691
Hello.

210
01:17:36,235 --> 01:17:37,611
Good to meet you.

211
01:17:37,695 --> 01:17:39,155
Want to eat with us tonight?

212
01:17:40,614 --> 01:17:42,324
- You're sure?
- Yes.

213
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:45,619
Goodbye.

214
01:33:51,251 --> 01:33:52,919
Times change.

215
01:33:53,086 --> 01:33:54,796
Thank God we had the partisans.

216
01:33:54,963 --> 01:33:59,092
I know, but times have changed.
It's different.

217
01:33:59,175 --> 01:34:01,261
What do you think of Bettino?

218
01:34:01,344 --> 01:34:04,222
- I don't like him.
- I like him.

219
01:34:04,472 --> 01:34:06,766
I'm happy, actually.

220
01:34:09,769 --> 01:34:11,813
I don't know. We'll see.

221
01:34:14,274 --> 01:34:16,818
Anyway, they make the rules.

222
01:34:20,530 --> 01:34:22,031
Pasquina!

223
01:34:22,115 --> 01:34:23,408
Hello.

224
01:34:23,491 --> 01:34:24,826
Hello, ma'am.

225
01:34:25,785 --> 01:34:27,871
- Tortelli cremaschi.
- Yes.

226
01:42:18,090 --> 01:42:20,009
You disappeared for three days.

227
01:42:27,475 --> 01:42:29,769
You completely disappeared.

228
01:42:36,025 --> 01:42:37,568
I had a lot to do.

229
01:44:49,825 --> 01:44:51,952
Come for dinner tonight.

230
01:44:52,036 --> 01:44:53,287
Bring Marzia.

231
01:44:54,872 --> 01:44:56,123
Bye, darling.

232
01:48:46,270 --> 01:48:47,813
If you'll excuse me...

233
01:48:47,896 --> 01:48:49,898
Just one second.

234
01:48:50,816 --> 01:48:52,234
One second!

235
01:49:11,837 --> 01:49:13,839
I saw them last year.

236
01:49:14,673 --> 01:49:17,176
Richard Butler... fantastic!

237
01:49:17,342 --> 01:49:21,013
Really? We saw them in concert too.

238
01:49:21,096 --> 01:49:23,932
We hitchhiked to London.

239
01:53:49,323 --> 01:53:50,532
Mafalda?

240
01:53:51,533 --> 01:53:52,659
Mom?

241
01:53:53,785 --> 01:53:55,203
Yeah, it's me.

242
01:53:56,538 --> 01:53:58,915
Yeah, everything is fine.
I'm at the station...

243
01:53:59,624 --> 01:54:00,959
in Clusone.

244
01:54:02,836 --> 01:54:04,546
Listen, Mom, can you...

245
01:54:06,173 --> 01:54:08,133
Can you come get me, Mom?

246
01:55:06,858 --> 01:55:09,111
I read the book you bought me.

247
01:55:09,820 --> 01:55:11,571
The poems...

248
01:55:11,655 --> 01:55:13,156
They're really beautiful.

249
01:55:13,281 --> 01:55:16,326
I love that... Antonia Pozzi.

250
01:55:19,496 --> 01:55:21,498
I'm sorry, excuse me...

251
01:55:21,623 --> 01:55:23,333
that you're sad.

252
01:55:24,626 --> 01:55:27,546
I'm saying that because
I wanted to tell you

253
01:55:27,671 --> 01:55:29,339
I'm not mad at you.

254
01:55:30,924 --> 01:55:32,259
Not at all.

255
01:55:39,891 --> 01:55:41,184
I love you, Elio.

256
01:55:46,606 --> 01:55:47,941
Stay friends?

257
01:55:49,985 --> 01:55:51,319
For life?

258
01:55:52,112 --> 01:55:53,405
For life?

259
01:58:06,371 --> 01:58:08,290
Because it was him.

260
01:58:09,457 --> 01:58:11,293
Because it was me.

261
02:03:19,309 --> 02:03:21,895
- Have you been to the Gaverine?
- Yes.

262
02:03:31,821 --> 02:03:33,489
- May I?
- Happy Hanukkah!

263
02:03:33,615 --> 02:03:34,699
To you too.

264
02:04:20,662 --> 02:04:21,663
Hello?
