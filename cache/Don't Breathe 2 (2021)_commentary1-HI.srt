1
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:23,729
Hello, everyone. My name is Rodo Sayagues.

2
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:28,059
I am the co-writer and director
of this movie

3
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:31,316
that we're about to see together.

4
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:34,656
This is a...

5
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,909
Logos and more logos

6
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:44,496
of all our producing partners
that helped us make this movie.

7
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:47,877
Ghost House Pictures.

8
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:50,172
That's Rob Tapert's
and Sam Raimi's company.

9
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:52,466
I always love that. That logo's beautiful.

10
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:56,217
And this is our company
with Fede Alvarez, Bad Hombre.

11
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,513
This is the first time that we see this.

12
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:05,267
So, here we go.

13
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:09,608
[siren wailing]

14
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,066
That is Detroit.

15
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:19,452
If you know the city, you would recognize
the skyline in the back.

16
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:29,253
This drone shot refers to the opening
of the first movie.

17
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:33,207
We wanted to open this one
in the same fashion,

18
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:38,138
but, you know, what's happening
is a little bit different this time.

19
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:44,348
This is a three-year-old little girl.

20
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:46,645
Just escaped that fire
walking down the street,

21
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:49,349
and she finally collapses on her knees.

22
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:09,626
We recognize that white lock of hair.

23
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:14,298
Understand that it's the same girl.
She's grown up now.

24
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,715
[bird caws]

25
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,339
[wings flapping]

26
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:22,139
And this was all shot in Serbia, actually.

27
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:26,219
And we discovered this place
in the middle of the woods

28
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:29,476
that had that piece of junk over there.
I'm not sure what it is.

29
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:34,402
No one knew what it was,
but what I liked about it is that,

30
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,946
although we open in the middle--
in the woods,

31
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:40,195
there's still elements that bring you
to a more urban setting.

32
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,696
[dog barking]

33
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:47,658
And we'll soon realize
that this is Detroit still.

34
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:53,997
A dystopian version of Detroit
where nature has claimed back its turf.

35
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,131
So, a basketball court.

36
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:03,556
We understand already
that we are in a city in the US.

37
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,393
[barking continues]

38
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,399
And that dog, actually, is one of the dogs
that we used in the first movie.

39
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:19,481
It's the same one, the same Rottweiler.
Which is crazy, but true.

40
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,319
Here we go. We discover...

41
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:29,949
Norman Nordstrom
for the first time in this movie.

42
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:31,742
You failed.

43
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:32,918
I didn't.

44
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:36,998
The gun is in my hand.

45
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,462
I thought I had it.

46
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,963
Sorry, Father. I'll make it next time.

47
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,594
Never take anything for granted.

48
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:48,926
God will take it from you.

49
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,179
Is God bad?

50
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:56,809
God is fair.

51
00:03:57,446 --> 00:04:00,859
And this, right here, this beat
is something that we talked about.

52
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,360
We gave it a lot of consideration with
Fede and Stephen Lang in the first movie.

53
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,783
We gave it a lot of consideration with
Fede and Stephen Lang in the first movie.

54
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,784
Norman said that there is no God,

55
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:15,836
and you clearly saw that it was a man

56
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:19,631
that was disenchanted with the idea
of a God and he's--

57
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:24,257
He used to believe in a God
and now lost his faith,

58
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:28,136
because he felt that that God failed him.

59
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,591
In this movie--

60
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:32,929
Now, we always thought that he...

61
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:38,392
at one point, thought that God
gave him a second opportunity

62
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:41,354
when he brought Phoenix to him.

63
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:44,315
And so, now he says, "God is fair."

64
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:48,368
In a way, he believes
that God and him are now even,

65
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:55,293
because God owed him something
and then gave him...

66
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,003
a daughter again.

67
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:05,173
So there's already movement in the journey

68
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,630
and the personal journey of Norman.

69
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,432
You failed survival.

70
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,223
It's been three months.

71
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:19,108
Plus, I just gave you a Killer haircut.

72
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:20,776
Trust me.

73
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,563
You need to pass all your tests first.

74
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,241
And this scene--
This is the first scene that we shot.

75
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,863
This was day one.

76
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:34,536
I was, of course, a little bit nervous.
It was my first day directing.

77
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:41,460
And it was also Madelyn's first day
doing a movie of this size.

78
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,668
She had worked in TV,
but not in a movie like this.

79
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:50,882
So, it was a first time for both of us,
and I think she did a great job already,

80
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:56,392
and it was a very demanding scene for her.
She had a lot of lines, and...

81
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:03,269
The drama in the scene
demanded a great performance,

82
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,071
and she came through
and she did a great job.

83
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,037
[door opens]

84
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,000
Go with Hernandez.

85
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,339
Back by sunset!

86
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,465
I will.

87
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,266
Hey, Hernandez.

88
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:36,559
[Hernandez] Hey, gorgeous.

89
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,728
He's not sure
if he did the right thing or not,

90
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:43,434
but it felt like
there was no way around it.

91
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:47,567
Eventually, he's gonna have to
at least give her something

92
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:51,525
and let her have a little bit of fun.

93
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,452
[singing]

94
00:06:56,625 --> 00:07:03,088
This is actually Detroit.
The streets, the houses.

95
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,041
And that's exactly the way it looks.

96
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:11,299
There's these neighborhoods
that are completely abandoned,

97
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:16,384
and they make part of the universe
of Don't Breathe,

98
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:18,890
the setting of Don't Breathe.

99
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,143
That very particular look
is because of this.

100
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,487
[door creaking]

101
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,365
I really enjoyed shooting this scene.

102
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,876
Those ashes flying in the air,

103
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,751
that's something that
we were not planning on doing

104
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,708
until a couple of days before shooting,
and then Fede called me and said,

105
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,044
"Hey, make sure
you have those ashes floating."

106
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,379
And I was like, "Yeah,
but does it really make sense?

107
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:59,560
Because this fire happened
eight years before this scene."

108
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:02,809
And he was like, "It doesn't matter.
It's gonna look great. Trust me."

109
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,230
And he was so right.

110
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:07,435
[footsteps, floorboards creaking]

111
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:18,029
[reporter] Police have issued a statewide
alert for this man, Dr. Thomas Hanniman.

112
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:20,490
He's believed to be running
an organ trafficking ring

113
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,665
operating in the Detroit area.

114
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,995
The alarming number of abductions
has recently risen in the city.

115
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,420
This is a developing story.

116
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,215
We'll update you
as more information comes to light.

117
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,759
Right now, let's take a look
at the weekend forecast.

118
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:35,804
Good morning, everyone.
I'm meteorologist Jerry...

119
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,257
[kids laughing, chattering]

120
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,770
[boy] Everyone, pull. Help me.

121
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,192
It's stuck.

122
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:53,609
Hey, wanna try something?

123
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:55,399
Okay.

124
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:03,332
This scene wasn't originally like this.
This was actually happening.

125
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:06,536
This is something that Phoenix would do,

126
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:09,667
and then she would have a conversation
with these kids.

127
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:12,876
But in the editing process,
we discovered that it was better

128
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:18,135
to play it out as a dream sequence, right?

129
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,589
[bell ringing]

130
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,767
And she's just daydreaming
about mingling with this kid,

131
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:24,720
and having friends and connecting.

132
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,647
And I think it's so much more effective.

133
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:31,944
It gives a window into her character,

134
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:35,568
and we clearly understand
what her hopes are.

135
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:39,826
And it really pays off so much better
at the end of the movie

136
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:45,955
when she finally decides to come in
and talk to them and present herself.

137
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,331
Okay, well, be quick.
I don't wanna anger your father.

138
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,881
[toilet flushes]

139
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,834
[singing]

140
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:07,892
I love this shot. I love how we reveal...

141
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,900
Raylan here, our antagonist.

142
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,323
Wow, you're pretty.

143
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:21,364
Also, this shot is
one of my favorite shots in the movie.

144
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:27,245
I think the idea was that that mirror
would reflect the red wall in the back

145
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,121
and then create some sort of...

146
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:36,880
blood-colored stripe
that links these two characters together.

147
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:43,015
Which is something that we will understand
further down the road in the story,

148
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:45,513
how these two characters are connected.

149
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:50,226
So, we thought it was a nice way
to start presenting that idea.

150
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,149
Well, I'm sorry if I scared you.

151
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,693
Who said you did?

152
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,948
And that is my cameo in the movie.
That hand.

153
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:04,115
The tight shot of that hand,
that's actually me,

154
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:09,750
because, you know,
Brendan had to have his lunch break.

155
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:12,123
And you're always rushing
when you're shooting movies,

156
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,954
so I said, "I'll do it."

157
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,298
[door closes]

158
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,714
You okay?

159
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,387
Yes. Just a weirdo.

160
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,634
Yeah.

161
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,429
No shortage of those around here.

162
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:30,604
If you take a closer look,
Hernandez's hat says "Bad Hombre."

163
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,852
That's the name of our company.

164
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:42,153
Follow them.

165
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:53,869
[Phoenix] Thanks, Hernandez.

166
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:57,248
We had a lot of fun today.

167
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:59,549
I could take her again next week
if you're okay with it.

168
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:02,003
No. Today was enough.

169
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:11,015
-I know it's none of my business, but--
-You're right.

170
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,601
It's not.

171
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:18,102
You're a bad man.

172
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:25,864
She clearly knows how to
push this guy's buttons, for sure.

173
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,908
At least I know you think that.

174
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,992
Just like sometimes I do about myself.

175
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,999
War changes us all.

176
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,628
No soul returns holy from it

177
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,427
But don't make her pay for that.

178
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,515
Thanks.

179
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:56,103
I like it how, throughout the first act,
he is slowly coming to understand

180
00:12:56,192 --> 00:13:00,151
that he's not going to be able
to keep her locked in this house forever.

181
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:01,649
She's growing up.

182
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:08,615
She just wants to go out
and, you know, explore the world,

183
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:10,696
and there's no stopping that.

184
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,624
So he sees-- He can sense and feel
that a storm is coming.

185
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:30,800
Here we introduce that red metal box.

186
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:36,684
I like it how, at this point,
it just raises questions.

187
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:40,187
"What is that thing?
What is he locking inside that thing?"

188
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:43,020
And we'll come to understand
the purpose of that box...

189
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,069
in a few scenes at this point.

You mind moving your vehicle
off the road, please?

193
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:08,469
You know, we're introducing the gang.

194
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,798
This is the only road back to town.

195
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:14,721
You served?

196
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,428
Yeah.

197
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,229
We all did, too.

198
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,062

-Yeah.</i>

[slurping]

201
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:31,694
I'd say that makes us honorable somehow.
Wouldn't you?

202
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,074
No.

203
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:37,623
Can you move your truck off the road now?

204
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:42,795
Sure, baby.

205
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,005
Whatever you want.

I really like this stare down
between the two of them.

211
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:25,084
It's like a standoff.
It makes you feel like we're setting up

212
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:28,132
a fight between the two of them
that will play later on in the movie,

213
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:30,756
but then, we just--

214
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:32,087
[choking]

00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:34,218

[hammer thudding]

221
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,066
That was intense.

222
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:52,320
It was a lot of fun shooting that scene.
It wasn't easy, you know.

223
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,276
The van was actually moving

224
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:59,410
and the actors were playing the scene
with the moving van looking forward.

225
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,207
So we were pushing from behind,

226
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:04,332
and it had to crash
against those containers

227
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:06,834
while Jim-Bob was swinging on her.

228
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:10,508
So, it was complicated,

229
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:12,757
but, you know,
it turned out great, I think.

230
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:14,212
I don't wanna be safe.

231
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:17,015
I wanna be normal. I wanna have friends.

232
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,762
-I wanna live a--
-Enough!

233
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:20,597
Enough.

234
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:25,390
I already lost a daughter once.

235
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,101
I'm not losing you.

236
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:28,856
But I'm lonely.

237
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,277
You have no idea what it is to be alone.

238
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:36,322
You have me.

239
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,406
You're not enough.

240
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:44,914
Oh. She hits him with that line.

241
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:49,752
I always thought it was like a dart
that she spits on to him...

242
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,626
and it hurt.

243
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:54,802
I love this shot, too.

244
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:59,554
How we end up with her
being locked in that tower alone.

245
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,892
After that scene,
I think it's clear what she wants

246
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:09,021
and what Norman fears.

247
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:15,900
And that's the source
of the conflict between them.

248
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,322
[sniffing]

249
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:24,829

"Covenant Shelter.

251
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,890
Your new home awaits you."

252
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:53,565
She's just dreaming
about a different life.

253
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:58,275
If you take a look
at the design of the house,

254
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:02,283
you realize that it's very much
a normal, suburban Detroit home,

255
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:05,911
but there's-- On that corner
where her bedroom is,

256
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:07,743
there's some sort of tower.

257
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:09,623
And that comes out of the idea

258
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:15,585
that there's a lot of elements
of a fairy tale in this story.

259
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:18,090
She's a princess locked in a tower,

260
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,888
and there's this dragon-like figure
that's guarding her

261
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:23,137
and keeping her locked there.

262
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:28,063
Because for him, it's his treasure, right?
His most precious thing.

263
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:32,609
And there's these guys that are coming
to rescue her, in a way.

264
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:36,654
At this point in the movie,
it feels that these guys are...

265
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,281
[rattling]

266
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,154
...you know, a threat to her.

267
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:45,864
But it's gonna be revealed later
that they're actually coming to save her.

268
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:51,203
It's a band of knights
that come to slay the dragon

269
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,038
and save the princess.

270
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,805
Shadow?

271
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,773
Here we start a continuous shot

272
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:15,144
Here we start a continuous shot

273
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:19,401
that is going to go for six minutes.

274
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,451
[whistles]

275
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:31,627
And this is inspired by that shot
in the first Don't Breathe,

276
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:34,454
when the robbers break into the house

277
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:39,793
and the camera goes around the house,
showing us the space

278
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,299
where the story is gonna happen
and pointing out elements

279
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:45,348
that are gonna play out
in the movie later on.

280
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,266
So, we wanted to do
kind of the same thing,

281
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,094
but expand a little bit more,

282
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,806
put some more action in it
and make it even longer.

283
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:56,526
It was complicated for sure.

284
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:59,104
It took us, like,
three weeks to prep this maybe,

285
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,814
and three or four days to shoot.

286
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,070
A lot of rehearsal with the actors.

287
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:09,497
There's pretty complex
choreography happening.

[footsteps]

289
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:18,085
But I think the result is great.

290
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:21,918
It elevates the suspense
and the tension in the scene.

291
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,597
The sound design is also beautiful.

292
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:35,148
It tells you what's happening off-screen

293
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,646
and why characters
are doing what they're doing.

[switch clicks]

295
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,398
It's just a great tool...

296
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,737
that plays phenomenally in this movie.

The guy turned the light on.

300
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:03,046
That's how she is able to tell
that this is not Norman.

301
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:06,095
Norman does not need
to turn the lights on.

302
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,430
And, of course, the footsteps,

303
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,474
she recognizes
that there's something weird.

304
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:12,928
It's just not her father.

305
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,601
And she's trained to react quick.

306
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:23,655
So all of the training that
she's been doing pays off at this moment.

[door opens, closes]

313
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:53,351
And we made a conscious decision
to not use any music during this scene,

314
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,303
because we thought
the sound design was crucial.

315
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:58,935
We just wanted to let it play
and come to the--

316
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,312
And take a front seat
during the whole scene.

317
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:08,775
And I think it works so well.
Just puts you in there.

[footsteps]

328
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:15,884
This is Adam Young.

329
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:18,094
An amazing actor.

330
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:20,646
I think he looks so scary.

331
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:22,940
Total psychopath.

332
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:36,947
This sequence was also shot
during the first week, so it was--

333
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,661
You know, we're--

334
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:41,459
All of us were just warming up,

335
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:44,037
and we had to do
this very complicated scene.

336
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:49,709
Everybody was on top of their game.
The actors did great, and, you know,

337
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:55,594
Adam already had
this very demanding beat to play,

338
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,470
and already close-ups and everything.

339
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:58,892
He just nailed it.

[sobbing]

346
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:50,103
I know there's a rule that says
that you don't kill dogs in movies,

347
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:52,734
and we had to break this rule.

348
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,611
We had to.

349
00:24:54,702 --> 00:24:55,988
But, uh...

350
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:03,704
there's gonna be a reward to this.

351
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:06,001
Some sort of reward.

352
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:09,046
The Blind Man is gonna find
a new companion.

353
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:27,932
[footsteps]

354
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,362
We're back in the house.

355
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,787
And Phoenix is still hiding.

356
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,878
She can hear the guys upstairs,

357
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:00,385
so it makes sense that maybe
she can make a run for the door

358
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:01,716
to get out of there.

359

I love that shot.

362

Here he comes.

363
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,102
[grunting]

364
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:54,485
The box! Now!

365
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:56,862
-[screams]
-Oh, that hurts.

366
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:57,939
Go!

367
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,581
[Phoenix screams]

00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,078
[grunting]

369
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,465
Go get the girl.

370
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:31,268
[grunting]

371
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,557
Open the door.

372
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:38,024
Now we understand
the purpose of that red box.

373
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:42,942
Norman had been preparing for
something like this for quite some time.

374
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:46,120
[panting]

375
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:09,685
Here, I think the prosthetics
did a great job.

376
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:13,139
That looks very real.

377
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,190
Oh, and painful.

378
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,937
And look at these guys, the gang...

379
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:24,650
I like that they are all very unique.

380
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:29,740
Usually in these kind of movies,
the henchmen, they all look the same.

381
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,200
But we made sure
that each one of these guys

382
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:36,003
had a different quality and look.

383
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:38,296
And I think we achieved that,

384
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:44,174
and we made sure that we got
really good actors to play these roles.

385
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:47,256
And Bobby, I love him. He's amazing.

386
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:50,469
There's a certain physicality to his role

387
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:53,145
and the way that--
What he can do with his face.

388
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:57,601
It always amazed me. Very skilled actor.

389
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,466
[squelching]

390
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:43,987
[scream echoing]

391
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:52,947
The glue.

392
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,833
The superglue set piece.

393
00:29:57,546 --> 00:30:01,130
This was an idea that-- One of
the first ideas that we had with Fede.

394
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:05,710
We thought it would be great
if the Blind Man would use superglue

395
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,636
to do something like this
to one of these guys

396
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:10,340
and just let him suffocate.

397
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,927
And [ think it plays great.

398
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:18,514
Bobby did a great job.
He actually couldn't breathe

399
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:23,899
when we were shooting that,
so we could only shoot for a minute or so.

400
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:28,608
So it was challenging to shoot this scene.

401
00:30:28,702 --> 00:30:32,240
He's actually not been able to breathe
at that point.

402
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:34,789
-Breathe, brother.

The guy's a Navy SEAL.

406
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:59,981
We had informed in the first movie
that Norman used to be--

407
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:06,187
He was a war veteran, but we didn't...

408
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:12,326
explain that he was a Navy SEAL,
which ups the game.

409
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,202
This guy's not playing around.

410
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:30,715
[groaning]

411
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:02,709
Now we're in the water tank.

412
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:04,207
This was also...

413
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:08,003
hard work to shoot,

414
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:13,554
but Madelyn, she has so much energy

415
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,177
and she was actually looking forward
to shooting that.

416
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:17,758
Since she read the script, she said,

417
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:22,472
"That's the scene
that I'm most looking forward to shoot,"

418
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:25,934
because she loves swimming
and swimming underwater.

419
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:28,485
Uh, and we spent a couple of days
shooting this scene

420
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:33,408
and she wanted to keep going and shoot
more days inside that water tank,

421
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:36,736
which was very demanding
because she had to perform underwater

422
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:41,370
and, you know, not easy,
but she just killed it.

423
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:49,581
Call Raylan.

424
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:59,591
I love this moment,

425
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:05,807
this standoff between Duke
and the Blind Man

426
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:08,734
and how he comes up with this whole idea,

427
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,812
you know, he's trying to smoke him
out of his hideout

428
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:15,070
and also force the girl to come out
of the box at the same time.

429
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:28,079
Metal box is almost full of water.

430

You prefer to see the kid alive...

431
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:37,050
you come in here.

432
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,391
You think I'm fucking with you?

433
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:47,101
No.

434
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:52,106
There's a live wire
about to reach the water.

435
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:53,983
Come out, or she's fried!

439

But Norman is smart.

440
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:09,454
He knows how to disarm this guy.

441
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:11,004
Clever fuck.

442
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:13,549
No guns, huh?

443
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:16,126
No problem.

444
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:18,462
I love how he's approaching, you know,

445
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:22,596
with this hand forward,
kind of like coming in peace.

446
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:28,022
You know, "Let's just talk things over.
No need to fight."

447
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:32,443
But with his other hand,
he's holding that iron rod...

448
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:39,529
and off we go.

449
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:43,408
[both grunting]

450
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:53,714
I think this fight is so intense and--

451
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:59,212
Most of it was the actors themselves.

452
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:02,924
You know, there's a couple of shots
where it's stunt doubles,

453
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:06,344
but most of the fight is, you know,

454
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:09,772
just Stephen Lang
and Rocci Boy Williams just going at it.

455
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:14,398
And Rocci Boy,
he used to be an MMA fighter,

456
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:18,196
so he's very tough, very, very tough
and he knows how to fight.

457
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:23,369
So he challenged Stephen Lang
who's also a guy that's,

458
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:28,871
you know, is very strong
and likes to train a lot,

459
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,076
so he pushed him to his limits,

460
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:33,663
and they just went at it.

461
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:37,091
I remember after--
And this went on for, like, two days.

462
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:39,009
When we finished--

463
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:43,430
When we finished shooting,
Stephen Lang said to me,

464
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:49,512
"Rodo, that guy is actually
really tough, for real." [laughs]

with bruises all over themselves.

But you're done.

477
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,423
That blast we actually did for real.

478
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:12,933
You know, it was probably the more
Hollywood-like moment on set,

479
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:15,013
having a real explosion.

480
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:20,068
A lot of fun, to be honest,
and we did it, like, two or three times

481
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:26,492
with an actual actor-- an actual
stunt double that was lit on fire.

482
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:30,196
So we had the whole
Hollywood experience on set,

483
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,247
and it looks great, I think.

484
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:44,297
[clanging]

485
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,221
[thud, grunts]

486
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:50,841
[clanging continues]

487
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:59,144
[grunting]

488
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:01,067
That red box is heavy.

489
00:38:01,154 --> 00:38:05,068
It probably weighs a ton
when it's full of water,

490
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:10,324
but, you know,
the Blind Man is really strong,

491
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:13,531
he's a tough guy
and he manages to tip it over.

492
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,707
[grunting]

493
00:38:28,181 --> 00:38:29,546
[sputtering]

494
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:31,006
Breathe.

495
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,558
-[gasping]
-Come on, breathe.

496
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:35,977
Breathe.

497
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:37,270
Breathe.

498
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:45,771
The old blind man did this?

499
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,276
Uh-huh.

500
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:51,409
Let's go.

501
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:53,533
I love the shot

502
00:38:53,623 --> 00:38:59,665
when she sees the aftermath
of the fight that she was only hearing,

503
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:02,746
and now she sees what happened
and is like, "Oh, my God.

504
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:05,173
My dad did that to that guy?"

505
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,421
[laughs]

506
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,628
I can walk.

507
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,338
I said I can walk.

508
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:13,678
[clanging]

509
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:15,596
What's happening?

510
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:28,688
Cover the exits.

511
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:42,748
What the fuck?

512
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:55,098
By the way, that's all real prosthetics.

513
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:59,769
It took, like, five hours
for them to apply that

514
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:02,723
on the actor

515
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,023
and it's great.

516
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:12,278
They're still down here.

517
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:43,930
What's happening?

518
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:47,601
-Who are they?
- I don't know.

519
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:52,488
[gunshot]

520
00:41:09,342 --> 00:41:11,424
I love this scene. I love the lighting.

521
00:41:11,511 --> 00:41:15,505
I think Pedro Luque, our DP,
did an amazing job.

522
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,428
I mean, throughout the whole movie
it looks amazing.

523
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:21,180
But this set...

524
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:25,856
I think is the one
that I like the most, how he lit it.

525
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:29,856
That mix of warms and cools,
it's beautiful.

526
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:34,989
[Raylan] You don't need
to be afraid, little girl.

527
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:39,736
This has all just been
one big misunderstanding.

528
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:53,549
It's not me you need to be scared of...

529
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:58,005
I love Stephen's performances
at this point

530
00:41:58,099 --> 00:42:00,010
and then Madelyn's as well.

531
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:01,933
...but the man standing next to you.

532
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:07,097
Now, I don't know who he is.

533
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:12,189
But I know who he's not.

534
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,897
She's like, "What is he talking about?"
[chuckles]

535
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:19,030
There's some truth
that's about to come out.

536
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:23,117
Should I tell her or you?

537
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:24,663
[Norman screams]

538
00:42:24,751 --> 00:42:25,866
[grunting]

539
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:31,371
Finish him, bro.

540
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,711
No!

541
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:36,919
-Dad! Dad, wake up.
-Aren't you something?

542
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:39,629
[grunting] Let me go!

543
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:42,803
Come on.

544
00:42:43,603 --> 00:42:44,809
No, it's okay.

545
00:42:48,024 --> 00:42:51,517
I love this, and I think Brendan did
an amazing job.

546
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:55,236
You really don't remember me, do you?

547
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:58,607
Maybe this will help.

548
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,954
Now we reveal the true identity
of these guys.

549
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:10,919
And going back to the idea
of the fairy tale,

550
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:14,373
we now realize
that these are actually knights

551
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:17,255
that are coming to save the princess
from the dragon.

552
00:43:19,472 --> 00:43:21,588
Years ago, there was a fire in our house.

553
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:24,512
Cops blamed me.

554
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:28,015
I spent eight years in prison,
wondering if I'd ever see you again.

555
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:34,734
Hell, I didn't even know
if you were dead or alive.

556
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,108
[dog whimpering]

557
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:40,899
This creep here must have...

558
00:43:41,911 --> 00:43:44,027
found you and kept you for himself.

559
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,205
[newscaster] Up next in local news,

560
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:50,829
a meth lab caught fire
in west Detroit this morning.

561
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,708
Police were able
to arrest the primary suspect.

562
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:56,506
The man was taken into custody
and could face charges

563
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:59,835
for a large number of crimes committed
over the past several years.

564
00:43:59,929 --> 00:44:03,012
[Raylan] You have no idea how much
I've been waiting for this moment.

565
00:44:12,108 --> 00:44:14,645
And in a way, she knows this is true.

566
00:44:15,528 --> 00:44:17,064
She knows it.

567
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:19,771
Did he hurt you?

568
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:26,073
But he did steal you away from me,
and now he must die, you understand?

569
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:29,114
Kill him.

570
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,243
[gun cocks]

571
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:31,870
-No.
-Fuck are you doing?

572
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:35,120
Not in front of my kid. Do it outside.

573
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:40,209
[chuckles] I love it how suddenly
he's got a dad's consciousness.

574
00:44:40,303 --> 00:44:42,465
He's a responsible dad.

575
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:44,671
He doesn't want to traumatize her.

576
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:46,760
[groans]

577
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:52,221
But then if he needs to shoot, he does,
and then he'll just go crazy. [laughing]

578
00:44:55,818 --> 00:45:01,063
That tells you already that this guy
is not a more stable person.

579
00:45:02,283 --> 00:45:03,614
[glass shatters]

580
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:07,322
[grunting]

581
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:11,573
Fucking coward.

582
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:21,841
Take her to the truck
while I hunt this motherfucker. Let's go.

583
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:30,058
-Let me go!
-What's wrong with you?

584
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:32,434
Fucking wanna go home?

585
00:45:33,022 --> 00:45:34,353
[both scream]

586
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:38,274
I love this moment.
I love Bobby's performance here.

587
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:42,446
He looks so scary
and frustrated and pissed.

588
00:45:43,324 --> 00:45:44,689
I love it.

589
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:48,447
And because he's such a crazy dude,

590
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:52,990
even though you know
that he should not hurt her,

591
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:58,170
he's so pissed right now
that you feel like he would do it.

592
00:45:58,256 --> 00:46:00,293
I don't care who you are.

593
00:46:00,383 --> 00:46:02,465
I'm gonna teach you
some fucking manners, yo.

594
00:46:03,219 --> 00:46:04,960
You ungrateful little bitch.

595
00:46:05,054 --> 00:46:06,465
[grunting]

596
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:11,137
[screams]

597
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:20,192
And this is moment where Phoenix
sees the monster in Norman.

598
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:25,864
You know, she sees her father
letting out that monster.

599
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:30,861
And she's never seen that side of him,
so she's very shocked and surprised.

600
00:46:32,081 --> 00:46:35,199
Here it comes. Ooh, the head smash.

601
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,542
That was a dummy.

602
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:41,542
We didn't want to do any CG.
We wanted to do everything practical,

603
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:47,719
so we created-- we had a dummy made
after Bobby, the actor.

604
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:53,972
And then we just smashed the dummy
with a real heavy iron shovel,

605
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:55,643
and I think it looks amazing.

606
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:12,573
Now we'll reveal
that these two guys are actually brothers,

607
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,745
so this makes it personal, you know,

608
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:17,540
and that's something that you
always want to see in these movies.

609
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:19,367
You know, make it personal,

610
00:47:19,462 --> 00:47:23,046
SO you know
that we're building up a nice fight

611
00:47:23,132 --> 00:47:25,499
between the Blind Man
and this guy, Jim-Bob.

612
00:47:25,593 --> 00:47:27,300
Move!

613
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:35,884
At this moment,
she's looking at her father--

614
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:38,720
Well, she now knows
that he's not her father,

615
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:42,478
but she's looking at Norman
with different eyes.

616
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:45,185
She just saw that he's also a monster.

617
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:49,981
So she's just, like,
having all of these thoughts

618
00:47:50,076 --> 00:47:54,195
and emotions swirling inside of her.

619
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:58,748
So many questions
and then she decides to confront him.

620
00:48:09,762 --> 00:48:11,252
It's his jacket.

621
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,175
Attaboy.

622
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:15,631
-[sniffing]
-Attaboy.

623
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:19,765
[Phoenix] Wait. Stop.

624
00:48:22,191 --> 00:48:23,556
Is it true?

625
00:48:23,651 --> 00:48:24,766
Move.

626
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,350
What's my real name?

627
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:27,685
Get over here now!

628
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,145
When's my birthday?

629
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,151
-My real one?
-Stop it!

630
00:48:31,242 --> 00:48:32,573
No, you stop it!

631
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:34,947
[barking]

632
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:37,369
She's questioning everything now.

633
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:42,121
She knows that she's going
to have to restructure her whole identity,

634
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:43,997
that she's been living in a lie.

635
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:48,630
[barking continues]

636
00:48:55,433 --> 00:49:00,052
This scene was also a lot of fun
to shoot with that dog.

637
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,438
The animal handlers did an amazing job.

638
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:11,484
The dog did exactly everything
that we needed him to do.

639
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:17,490
We also had a puppet
that looked very realistic.

640
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:20,948
I think that shot was a puppet.

641
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,914
Now she escapes.

642
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:33,668
This was shot on location.
So, with this house we have--

643
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:37,346
We built it on location
to shoot the exteriors of the house

644
00:49:37,433 --> 00:49:42,269
and then we built the interior
of the house on a set.

645
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:44,595
So we had to build it twice.

646
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:46,476
And this is shot on location.

647
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:50,777
But this is on set,
so this is not in the heights.

648
00:49:52,031 --> 00:49:56,525
The closer shots, I mean,
and the wider shots are on location.

649
00:49:58,329 --> 00:50:00,696
That's the puppet right there.
I think it looks great.

650
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:04,248
And then the real dog, of course.

651
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:05,871
-[groans]
-[dog snarling]

652
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:15,463
I love this moment,
I think it's more about

653
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:19,593
whether he's going
to be able to kill a dog or not.

654
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:22,050
This is something
that we talked with Stephen Lang.

655
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:25,432
This scene is not about
whether he's going to survive or not,

656
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:26,888
because he knows he's got a gun

657
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:29,098
and eventually,
he can shoot the dog and kill it.

658
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:34,939
But what's at stake here is his morals,
his ethics, his moral compass,

659
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:36,363
you know, is he going to be--

660
00:50:37,243 --> 00:50:40,452
Is he going to break that code
that he lives by?

661
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:42,404
Because we know how he relates to dogs.

662
00:50:42,498 --> 00:50:45,786
Is he going to break it or not?
And he just can't.

663
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:01,964

665

-Phoenix!

666
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:16,941
-[grunting]
-Calm down, girl.

667
00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:22,986
So they finally capture her.

668
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,581
[dog whining]

669
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:43,761
This is the only way
that we could figure out

670
00:51:43,851 --> 00:51:46,764
for him to be able to--

671
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:52,390
To get away without hurting the dog.

672
00:51:58,616 --> 00:52:00,106
Put her in the truck.

673
00:52:06,415 --> 00:52:09,123
So they got her and now, of course,
what are they going to do?

674
00:52:10,419 --> 00:52:12,285
Set this thing on fire.

675
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:19,301
Now we reveal what was inside this cooler.

676
00:52:20,429 --> 00:52:24,468
The idea that when we reveal--
When we showed it in the first act,

677
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:27,596
the idea is that you connected it
to the organ trafficking ring,

678
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:31,182
but now you would understand
this is not about that...

679
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:34,727
for now, of course.

680
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:42,858
I love how this character, Raul,
is having second thoughts, you know.

681
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:48,242
He's maybe not that okay
with this guy's methods.

682
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:54,744
And he's gonna--
He's gonna have a bigger arc

683
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:56,294
by the end of the movie.

684
00:52:56,382 --> 00:52:58,794
And by the way, that guy Raul

685
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:02,047
is another character
that was in the first movie.

686
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:05,679
In the first movie, the robbers--

687
00:53:05,766 --> 00:53:09,134
You know, there's this guy
in the back of a van

688
00:53:09,228 --> 00:53:15,941
in an empty parking lot
that gives one of the robbers the tip

689
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:18,609
about the Blind Man
that's got this money and all that.

690
00:53:18,696 --> 00:53:24,362
That guy is Raul, who is Christian Zagia,
an actor from Uruguay,

691
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:28,323
who I think did a great job in this movie.

692
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:34,876
So all of this fire that you're seeing
is real, most of it.

693
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:38,921
We set the whole house on fire
on location, it was crazy.

694
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:41,799
[dog barking]

695
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:53,011
I loved how, even though he knows
that the house is catching fire,

696
00:53:53,105 --> 00:53:56,314
he just has to come back
and save that dog.

697
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:02,152
Which eventually is gonna--

698
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:07,780
Is gonna save his life
because the dog is going to repay him.

699
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:12,576
So all of that fire is real.

700
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:15,457
We put Stephen in--

701
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:20,959
In a very harsh position there.

702
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:24,633
It was hot as hell on that set.

703
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:30,177
Of course there's--

704
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:33,635
Those flames are not real, those ones.
There's some that are CG.

705
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:36,637
But 80% of it is real.

706
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:43,691
And this is an homage to the first movie.

707
00:54:44,448 --> 00:54:47,907
We did the same thing
with one of the characters, Alex.

708
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:52,283
But now, you know, the tables are turned
and it's his turn to be there

709
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:53,703
and experience--

710
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:57,662
And experience that ordeal.

711
00:55:00,631 --> 00:55:02,463
[explosion, glass shatters]

712
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:03,960
[grunting]

713
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:18,896
I love this shot of--
The camera pivots around him

714
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:21,349
and we discover the house...

715
00:55:23,362 --> 00:55:26,821
set on fire and, again, this is all real.

716
00:55:26,907 --> 00:55:29,239
We had every fireman in Belgrade...

717
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,198
[chuckles] expecting the worst,
because we were shooting this.

718
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:34,744
This is in the woods,

719
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:37,915
so there's a lot of trees
that could potentially catch fire.

720
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:40,242
So it was risky, but it was worth it.

721
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:18,831
She wakes up in this weird place.

722
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:24,670
And we love the idea of working
with our production designer, Dave Warren.

723
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:27,839
He's an absolute genius.

724
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:30,167
He-- We came up with the idea

725
00:56:30,262 --> 00:56:33,971
that maybe this used to be the bar
at the hotel,

726
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:37,846
but this guy just repurposed it
and made it into his bedroom...

727
00:56:39,855 --> 00:56:42,392
which makes a lot of sense to me.

728
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:45,440
Like, this guy would definitely do that,
you know?

729
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:46,733
You all right?

730
00:56:48,697 --> 00:56:50,028
Wanna sit with me?

731
00:56:51,742 --> 00:56:54,234
Come, sit with me. Come on.

732
00:56:54,328 --> 00:56:57,411
This is a-- I feel like this is
a very intimate scene,

733
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:58,953
and we decided to--

734
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:04,494
To shoot all this
with very tight close-ups.

735
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:10,630
And we actually keep getting tighter
as the conversation unfolds

736
00:57:10,719 --> 00:57:12,926
and she starts asking questions
about her past

737
00:57:13,013 --> 00:57:16,381
and getting more intimate with her father.

738
00:57:16,475 --> 00:57:19,012
And the use of the light,
there's a warmth to it.

739
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:26,099
We wanted to make it feel
like a safe place for her,

740
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:28,059
so you would feel like maybe, you know,

741
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:33,569
she's just going to stay here
and live her life with her family.

742
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:36,783
Do I have any brothers or sisters?

743
00:57:39,206 --> 00:57:40,913
Unfortunately, no.

744
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:44,874
When's my birthday?

745
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:47,249
February 20th.

746
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:51,544
What was my mother's name?

747
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:54,760
Josephine.

748
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:57,262
Do I look like her?

749
00:57:58,976 --> 00:57:59,966
I love this.

750
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:01,967
Yeah.

751
00:58:02,062 --> 00:58:03,302
Because she's been asking--

752
00:58:03,397 --> 00:58:06,105
These are the questions
that she's been asking the Blind Man

753
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:09,149
for her whole life,
and she never got straight-up answers,

754
00:58:09,236 --> 00:58:11,443
especially when
she would mention her mother.

755
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:13,646
And we saw that
at the beginning of the movie,

756
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:16,448
she asked about her mother

757
00:58:16,535 --> 00:58:18,947
and the Blind Man
just doesn't want to go there.

758
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:21,404
And now she's finally being able
to ask that question,

759
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:24,115
"Does she look like me?
Do I look like her?"

760
00:58:24,668 --> 00:58:28,081
And she finally gets the answer that
she wanted, and Raylan just says, "Yes."

761
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:29,753
I'm not sorry.

762
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,751
You shouldn't be, either.

763
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:33,173
I wanna go.

764
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:36,301
Where? Where you gonna go?

765
00:58:36,388 --> 00:58:38,220
There's a shelter I know.

766
00:58:39,975 --> 00:58:43,513
Like I said,
you're not a prisoner anymore.

767
00:58:44,438 --> 00:58:47,601
And this guy is doing
what Norman never did,

768
00:58:47,691 --> 00:58:52,310
which is, you know, "It's your life,
and if you decide to go somewhere else

769
00:58:52,404 --> 00:58:55,942
and whatever you want to do,
it's fine with me.

770
00:58:56,033 --> 00:58:57,523
You're not a prisoner."

771
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:02,827
I love this beat.

772
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:06,327
You know, she walks out and there's
all these dudes outside, just waiting.

773
00:59:06,418 --> 00:59:09,877
And this guy-- And if you remember,
we saw this guy on the TV

774
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:14,002
that was playing that news report
about the organ trafficking ring.

775
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:32,057
I love this shot.

776
00:59:32,152 --> 00:59:34,860
It just creates a lot of tension
because, in a way,

777
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:38,689
you can't believe that these guys are
just going to let her go just like that.

778
00:59:38,784 --> 00:59:41,321
And there's the door.
Is she going to leave?

779
00:59:42,037 --> 00:59:43,744
Is she going to leave or not?

780
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:48,282
So I think it works really well.

781
00:59:48,877 --> 00:59:53,917
But then they have
this card up their sleeves.

782
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:03,471
[woman singing]

783
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:12,064
This is one of my favorite scenes
in the whole movie.

784
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:17,486
This reveal that, actually,
Mother was still alive.

785
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:19,609
[singing]

786
01:00:23,912 --> 01:00:26,950
I love Madelyn's performance here.

787
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:31,159
Her reaction made it feel
like that song that she sang

788
01:00:31,253 --> 01:00:35,918
in the beginning of the movie is, like,
pushing every cell of her body,

789
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:37,964
every memory.

790
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:46,849
It's just tapping into her memories
that were buried

791
01:00:46,935 --> 01:00:48,141
and it's all coming out.

792
01:00:48,228 --> 01:00:52,688
And she knows what this means
and she knows what it is.

793
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:55,641
She's just in deep shock.

794
01:00:59,156 --> 01:01:04,947
This is Fiona O'Shaughnessy,
a wonderful actress from the UK.

795
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:09,993
And I can't imagine anyone better fit
for this role.

796
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:11,949
She just killed it.

797
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:14,910
She got so emotionally invested
in the character.

798
01:01:15,005 --> 01:01:19,044
She just gave an absolutely
astonishing performance, I think.

799
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:22,759
Like I said...

800
01:01:23,555 --> 01:01:25,296
everything he told you was a lie.

801
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,351
It's a family reunion, finally.

802
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:41,524
Now we know her actual name, Tara,

803
01:01:41,615 --> 01:01:44,198
and she-- It's new to her.

804
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:48,694
You... got so big.

805
01:01:52,876 --> 01:01:55,789
[laughs] She looks so creepy.

806
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:01,373
Come here.

807
01:02:01,468 --> 01:02:05,678
And this hug is real, you know?

808
01:02:07,057 --> 01:02:08,889
Phoenix is really feeling it.

809
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:12,218
It's like this is what she always wanted,
you know, her mom,

810
01:02:12,312 --> 01:02:14,303
and finally she's here. She's alive.

811
01:02:15,357 --> 01:02:17,974
Oh, baby, we missed you so much.

812
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:26,573
Mmm. There you are.

813
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:31,871
You were such a beautiful baby.

814
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:36,576
And this scene is also one of the most
important scenes in the whole movie.

815
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:40,254
You know,
we're now gonna reveal what the--

816
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:43,628
What their motivations actually are.

817
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:45,459
-[Raylan] Get it out. Come on.
-[coughing]

818
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:48,136
There you go. There you go.

819
01:02:48,223 --> 01:02:49,384
-There you go.
-Sorry.

820
01:02:49,474 --> 01:02:51,010
[Raylan] Nothing to apologize for.

821
01:02:53,228 --> 01:02:54,889
Are you okay?

822
01:02:58,108 --> 01:03:01,521
The same fire that destroyed our family...

823
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:04,194
I think these two have
a lot of chemistry together.

824
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:09,947
They make a really creepy
and wonderful couple.

825
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:13,779
Mom and Dad used to have a...

826
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:18,158
kitchen...

827
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:24,674
in the basement of our house,
where we used to cook.

828
01:03:28,555 --> 01:03:30,887
It was for our business.

829
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:36,726
Are you thirsty?

830
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:39,100
Phoenix is slowly connecting the dots.

831
01:03:46,448 --> 01:03:47,779
[chuckles]

832
01:03:51,286 --> 01:03:52,617
[Josephine] Tara?

833
01:03:54,414 --> 01:03:55,825
I'm dying.

834
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:56,905
What?

835
01:03:58,585 --> 01:04:01,122
The smoke from the chemicals...

836
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:05,581
poisoned my blood
and badly damaged my heart.

837
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:08,713
I don't think I have much time left.

838
01:04:08,803 --> 01:04:10,464
Is there anything you can do?

839
01:04:10,555 --> 01:04:12,592
[Josephine giggles]

840
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:23,690
I heard you left flowers for me
at our old house.

841
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:32,157
I love it how, the approach, and going
back to the idea of the fairy tale.

842
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:34,735
Right now, we realize that
these knights that saved her

843
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:37,867
were actually working for the evil witch

844
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:42,167
and the evil witch, what she wants,
just like in Snow White,

845
01:04:42,253 --> 01:04:48,920
she wants to absorb the youth
out of Phoenix for herself.

846
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:54,050
It's very, of course, twisted.

847
01:04:55,642 --> 01:04:57,132
I need a new heart, baby.

848
01:04:57,227 --> 01:05:00,390
A very twisted concept,
she being her mother.

849
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:04,644
Her thought process is, you know,
"I gave you life once,

850
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:06,475
and now I need it back.

851
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:09,770
And you should give it to me
gracefully and willingly."

852
01:05:13,827 --> 01:05:15,693
Like a direct relative.

853
01:05:15,787 --> 01:05:17,448
Which is what she's trying to do.

854
01:05:17,539 --> 01:05:22,284
Because she just might as well
just move ahead with the surgery,

855
01:05:22,377 --> 01:05:23,412
and that's it.

856
01:05:23,503 --> 01:05:25,744
But she wants to convince her

857
01:05:26,631 --> 01:05:32,092
to give out her heart willingly
out of love for her.

858
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:33,668
That's what she wants.

859
01:05:35,432 --> 01:05:41,348
So that she can sleep at night
without any sort of remorse.

860
01:05:47,986 --> 01:05:51,900
And this shot, I think,
is very much of a fairy tale,

861
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:57,193
the hand hovering on top of her
as she passes out.

862
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:06,911
Going back to the Blind Man, a light
of hope on the horizon as he wakes up.

863
01:06:07,005 --> 01:06:09,246
[grunting]

864
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:19,344
[groaning]

865
01:06:20,477 --> 01:06:22,218
[dog panting]

866
01:06:26,524 --> 01:06:27,514
[Norman] Go home.

867
01:06:27,609 --> 01:06:28,974
[metal clinking]

868
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:31,400
-[dog whines]
-Shh.

869
01:06:31,488 --> 01:06:33,229
-[whines]
-Shh!

870
01:06:37,577 --> 01:06:39,363
[metal clinking]

871
01:06:51,299 --> 01:06:56,089
I love how the sound design
plays into the story here

872
01:06:56,179 --> 01:07:02,846
and how we get into the Blind Man's head
and experience how he perceives the world

873
01:07:02,936 --> 01:07:06,304
through his hearing.

874
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:13,565
And that guides him to discover
Hernandez's van and her body.

875
01:07:26,251 --> 01:07:27,958
[clinking]

876
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:02,484
[sobs]

877
01:08:06,332 --> 01:08:11,452
At this point, we feel that the Blind Man
is starting to slowly understand

878
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:17,341
all the pain that he has caused,
all the death,

879
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:22,554
the trail of death that he's left behind
because of his actions.

880
01:08:23,224 --> 01:08:26,091
Because Hernandez would be alive
if it wasn't for him.

881
01:08:28,187 --> 01:08:29,803
[dog panting]

882
01:08:33,443 --> 01:08:34,478
Stay.

883
01:08:36,988 --> 01:08:42,028
I love this idea on how he finds a way
to track down these guys...

884
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:49,698
and get to Phoenix using the dog.

885
01:08:50,668 --> 01:08:54,286
He knows dogs and he knows that the dog
is going to go back home,

886
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:55,620
wherever that home is.

887
01:08:55,715 --> 01:09:00,175
So he just has to follow the dog
and that's it.

888
01:09:01,095 --> 01:09:03,211
I think that idea, at a script level,

889
01:09:03,306 --> 01:09:05,923
it took us months
to come up with that idea

890
01:09:06,017 --> 01:09:10,682
and figure out how the hell the Blind Man
was going to find these guys.

891
01:09:10,772 --> 01:09:11,762
Go home.

892
01:09:11,856 --> 01:09:13,472
But at the end, I think it works great.

893
01:09:13,566 --> 01:09:16,274
I think was Fede's idea,
and I think it's genius.

894
01:09:21,115 --> 01:09:22,321
Go home.

895
01:09:24,118 --> 01:09:25,529
[dripping]

896
01:09:32,877 --> 01:09:36,541
I think this is the last shot
that we shot in the movie.

897
01:09:37,548 --> 01:09:38,879
[chuckles]

898
01:09:44,806 --> 01:09:46,717
[drill whirring]

899
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:06,984
I hope you understand
the high risks of this procedure.

900
01:10:08,621 --> 01:10:12,159
[Raylan] I think I pay you enough.
Shut up and do your job.

901
01:10:13,668 --> 01:10:15,454
Why is she still alive?

902
01:10:16,921 --> 01:10:19,253
[surgeon] If she's dead, so is her heart.

903
01:10:20,675 --> 01:10:24,418
And I can't keep it fresh long enough
without the proper equipment.

904
01:10:26,597 --> 01:10:28,964
[laughing] That is so creepy.

905
01:10:30,768 --> 01:10:35,262
And I like this beat,
you know, Mother just calls her

906
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:39,058
and says, "Thank you."

907
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:40,392
I think that is so creepy.

908
01:10:40,486 --> 01:10:45,731
And that is tied to that idea
that the mother convinced herself

909
01:10:45,825 --> 01:10:51,161
that Phoenix was doing this willingly,
you know, and she just thanks her.

910
01:11:01,424 --> 01:11:02,755
What's wrong with you, man?

911
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:10,506
Come back to Raul, and we show how
he is growing a conscience

912
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:13,843
and he's slowly switching sides.

913
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:15,301
You know, he's not--

914
01:11:15,396 --> 01:11:19,264
He probably didn't know exactly what
these guys were going to do to that girl.

915
01:11:19,358 --> 01:11:24,068
And now he just feels like
he can't go with it.

916
01:11:24,155 --> 01:11:25,566
It's just too much.

917
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:30,651
I love it when you give these villains,
these henchmen,

918
01:11:30,745 --> 01:11:34,830
when you give them some depth,
and you get to understand

919
01:11:34,916 --> 01:11:38,580
what their moral compass is
and, you know, what their code is.

920
01:11:38,669 --> 01:11:41,661
There's things that they would do,
but some things they wouldn't.

921
01:11:41,756 --> 01:11:45,670
Of course, Jim-Bob, the other guy,
is a total psychopath. He's cool with it.

922
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:49,298
He just cares about their business
and the money

923
01:11:49,388 --> 01:11:51,470
and they need her and that's it.

924
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:52,968
[drill whirring]

925
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:03,141
Boom.

926
01:12:05,530 --> 01:12:06,861

928
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:13,318
Go check it out.

Rats. Real rats.

932
01:13:02,086 --> 01:13:04,123
I love this next shot.

933
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:07,422
It will reveal the Blind Man.

934
01:13:08,926 --> 01:13:10,337
I think it's beautiful.

935

-[grunting]
-[gunshots]

936
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:30,319
Of course, the sound of the water
pouring down makes it very difficult

937
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:36,152
for the Blind Man to locate Jim-Bob.

938
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:38,156
He's confused.

939
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:39,908
His radar is off.

940
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:42,578
And he just takes a beating.

941
01:13:49,175 --> 01:13:54,511
But he's got his tricks, of course.

Jim-Bob needs to make a run for the gun,
but he's going to make a sound as well.

950
01:14:26,629 --> 01:14:28,916
But he takes a risk. Boom.

That hammer went down really hard.

957
01:15:08,754 --> 01:15:11,792
And it was a heavy hammer,
because it's a one-piece iron hammer.

958
01:15:11,882 --> 01:15:16,592
And Stephen Lang, you know,
just went at it.

959
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:19,842
And Adam was actually there

960
01:15:19,932 --> 01:15:24,472
when Slang was hitting the ground.

961
01:15:24,562 --> 01:15:29,898
So he had to move in order
to avoid getting hit by the hammer.

962
01:15:30,609 --> 01:15:35,604
So it was very stressful for Adam
to shoot that scene.

963
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:42,994
Disloyal fucking animal.

964
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:48,075
I love it how the dog
also has an arc in this movie.

965
01:15:48,169 --> 01:15:51,912
-Everything's okay, I promise.
-Baby, should I be worried?

966
01:15:52,006 --> 01:15:53,417
No, no. Not at all.

967
01:15:53,507 --> 01:15:54,918
I got you. I got you.

968
01:15:55,009 --> 01:15:56,750
I can't work without power.

969
01:15:59,722 --> 01:16:01,258
Change of plans, then.

970
01:16:02,308 --> 01:16:04,219
Pack your things. Bring the girl.

971
01:16:04,310 --> 01:16:05,471
Raul.

972
01:16:07,271 --> 01:16:09,638
-Bring the men. Kill the blind man.
-How many of us?

973
01:16:09,732 --> 01:16:11,894
All of you!

974
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:16,565
Let's go.

975
01:16:20,701 --> 01:16:22,942
I love the scene that's coming up next.

976
01:16:27,875 --> 01:16:30,583
On paper, you know, we made total sense.

977
01:16:30,669 --> 01:16:32,455
We thought of the idea with Fede

978
01:16:32,546 --> 01:16:36,631
that these guys are going to walk
into that pool,

979
01:16:36,717 --> 01:16:41,678
and the water ripples are going
to make contact with the Blind Man's hand

980
01:16:41,764 --> 01:16:44,722
and then he knows where these guys are,
and he shoots.

981
01:16:44,809 --> 01:16:49,929
But then, you know, shooting that on set
was a different story.

982
01:16:50,022 --> 01:16:53,481
You know, being able to capture
those water ripples,

983
01:16:53,567 --> 01:16:58,107
it was a huge challenge
in terms of lighting and camera movement.

984
01:16:58,197 --> 01:17:00,734
It wasn't easy,
but we got very, very lucky.

985
01:17:00,825 --> 01:17:05,114
And our team were such professionals
and so good at what they do.

986
01:17:05,204 --> 01:17:10,870
They were actually able
to pull it off pretty quickly, I think.

987
01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:18,006
I think this next shot, this is the camera
following that actual water ripple.

988
01:17:18,926 --> 01:17:20,382
It was just perfect.

989
01:17:31,188 --> 01:17:32,178
[spluttering]

990
01:17:38,821 --> 01:17:44,567
In this moment, I love it, because
the Blind Man is totally defenseless now.

991
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:47,027
He's at the mercy of this guy.

992
01:17:49,623 --> 01:17:50,784
<i>They're gonna kill her.</i>

993
01:17:56,046 --> 01:17:57,707
And that's not cool with me.

994
01:17:58,799 --> 01:18:00,665
But now he switched sides.

995
01:18:00,759 --> 01:18:04,047
He's grown in consciousness.

996
01:18:04,138 --> 01:18:07,472
And because of that,
you know, he saves the day.

997
01:18:07,558 --> 01:18:09,299
He actually saves the girl.

998
01:18:15,816 --> 01:18:17,227
But he's relieved.

999
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:22,228
Go left.

1000
01:18:24,074 --> 01:18:25,064
That way.

1001
01:18:28,579 --> 01:18:30,161
He'll kill you all.

1002
01:18:40,591 --> 01:18:44,550
Now we enter the biggest scene
in the whole movie.

1003
01:18:45,971 --> 01:18:49,805
This, I think, took, like,
seven or eight days to shoot--

1004
01:18:51,644 --> 01:18:55,137
To shoot the scene,
plus a couple days of second unit.

1005
01:18:56,649 --> 01:18:59,311
And this place is actually--
This is Belgrade.

1006
01:18:59,401 --> 01:19:04,692
And this swimming pool is in--

1007
01:19:04,782 --> 01:19:08,650
Marshal Tito,
who was the leader of Yugoslavia,

1008
01:19:08,744 --> 01:19:10,530
it's his palace.

1009
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:15,823
[Josephine] Baby.

1010
01:19:15,918 --> 01:19:17,625
Shh. It's okay.

1011
01:19:17,711 --> 01:19:19,076
-Stop it.
-[grunts]

1012
01:19:20,339 --> 01:19:25,084
The swimming pool is not that deep,
but we enhanced it in CG

1013
01:19:25,177 --> 01:19:27,839
and we made it to be a diving pool,

1014
01:19:29,014 --> 01:19:31,631
which are usually 20 feet deep
or something.

1015
01:19:31,725 --> 01:19:35,719
Deep enough to where if you fall into it,
you've probably killed yourself.

1016
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:55,325
I love this red smoke scene.

1017
01:19:56,083 --> 01:19:57,164
Very intense.

1018
01:19:57,251 --> 01:19:58,286
[Raylan] I can't see you.

[gun clicking]

1031
01:20:58,896 --> 01:21:02,059
I love this moment.
This is connected to the first movie where

1032
01:21:02,149 --> 01:21:05,858
the Blind Man accidentally shoots Cindy,

1033
01:21:05,944 --> 01:21:09,153
the girl that he trapped in the basement.

1034
01:21:10,074 --> 01:21:14,193
He thinks he shot one of the intruders,
but he ended up killing her.

1035
01:21:14,286 --> 01:21:15,697
And this is the same thing.

1036
01:21:15,788 --> 01:21:21,158
Raylan thinks that he got the Blind Man,
but he just killed his wife.

1037
01:21:23,170 --> 01:21:24,251
No.

1038
01:21:24,338 --> 01:21:25,954
No!

1039
01:21:26,048 --> 01:21:27,755

I love this.

1045
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:56,947
This is one of those "good news, bad news"
action set pieces, you know.

1046
01:21:57,037 --> 01:21:58,903
Good news, Mother is dead.

1047
01:21:58,997 --> 01:22:03,662
Bad news, she's now going to drag
Phoenix into the swimming pool.

1048
01:22:04,461 --> 01:22:06,748
Good news, there's a machete.

1049
01:22:11,218 --> 01:22:15,928
Bad news, I cannot chop the arm in time,

1050
01:22:17,057 --> 01:22:19,799
and I'm dragged into the swimming pool.

1051
01:22:19,893 --> 01:22:23,261
And also the Blind Man
appears to be losing his fight.

And this is the payoff, you know,
because the Blind Man saved this dog,

1057
01:22:40,289 --> 01:22:42,951
now this dog is loyal to him
and saves him.

1058
01:22:43,542 --> 01:22:45,158

01:23:07,357 --> 01:23:08,438
Now...

1063
01:23:09,610 --> 01:23:12,602
you're gonna see what I see.

1064
01:23:12,696 --> 01:23:14,812
Actually, that line
was not in the first movie.

1065
01:23:14,907 --> 01:23:16,693
It was just in the promotional material.

1066
01:23:16,783 --> 01:23:21,198
"Now you're going to see what I see.”
We decided to include it in this movie.

1067
01:23:21,288 --> 01:23:25,828
And [ think it plays great
for the eye-gouge thing.

1068
01:23:47,105 --> 01:23:52,771
The good news, she landed on top
of her mother and she was saved.

1069
01:23:52,861 --> 01:23:54,443
She didn't get hurt.

1070
01:24:00,202 --> 01:24:04,366
Now, this scene is the most important
scene in the whole movie.

1071
01:24:04,456 --> 01:24:08,745
This completes Norman's arc.

1072
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:12,582
To this point, you don't know
what he's going to do

1073
01:24:12,673 --> 01:24:15,290
when he finally gets to Phoenix.

1074
01:24:15,384 --> 01:24:17,250
And this is a surprise.

1075
01:24:17,344 --> 01:24:23,511
He actually sets her free
by confessing his crimes

1076
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:28,219
and his past sins
and telling her who he truly is.

1077
01:24:33,944 --> 01:24:37,938
Everything he said...

1078
01:24:40,867 --> 01:24:42,153
is true.

1079
01:24:48,834 --> 01:24:55,126
He confesses his things to himself
as well, which is the hardest thing to do.

1080
01:24:55,966 --> 01:24:58,253
I have killed.

1081
01:25:03,807 --> 01:25:04,968
I--

1082
01:25:06,101 --> 01:25:11,267
In the first movie, he made it very clear
that he was not doing anything wrong.

1083
01:25:11,356 --> 01:25:13,893
He was just amending things.

1084
01:25:13,984 --> 01:25:17,852
Like he would just come up
with excuses for his behavior.

1085
01:25:18,655 --> 01:25:20,771
He said, "I didn't do this,
I didn't do that,"

1086
01:25:20,866 --> 01:25:25,201
and now he's coming around,
coming to terms with his true nature,

1087
01:25:25,287 --> 01:25:28,405
and with the horrible things
that he's done.

1088
01:25:28,498 --> 01:25:29,863
And I think...

1089
01:25:31,126 --> 01:25:36,872
he's actually feeling, himself,
the pain that he's caused to others.

1090
01:25:36,965 --> 01:25:39,832
The misery that he has caused to others.

1091
01:25:39,926 --> 01:25:43,885
And he feels it. He understands it.

1092
01:25:43,972 --> 01:25:46,714
And only then, he truly repents.

1093
01:25:48,018 --> 01:25:49,258
-Go!
-[gasps]

1094
01:25:51,396 --> 01:25:52,727
And releases her.

1095
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:11,956
"He has integrated his shadow,”
Carl Jung would say.

1096
01:26:13,377 --> 01:26:15,118
And he accepts his destiny.

1097
01:26:18,215 --> 01:26:19,546
He's embarrassed.

1098
01:26:19,633 --> 01:26:23,877
And I think Stephen Lang gave an amazing,
awesome performance here.

1099
01:26:23,970 --> 01:26:26,257
Very honest and very raw.

[thud]

1101
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:35,934
And now, he understands he's going to die.
He's not even fighting.

1102
01:26:37,192 --> 01:26:40,901
He just accepts his fate
and his punishment.

1103
01:26:44,116 --> 01:26:45,527

01:27:33,749 --> 01:27:37,413
The sun is slowly coming out.

that it's his time

01:27:55,353 --> 01:27:57,390
and that he's okay with it.

1115
01:27:58,398 --> 01:27:59,888
Let me help you.

1116
01:28:01,693 --> 01:28:03,309
I can save you.

1117
01:28:07,741 --> 01:28:10,324
And he says that she already saved him

1118
01:28:10,410 --> 01:28:15,996
because she pushed him to confess
and come to terms with his true nature

1119
01:28:16,082 --> 01:28:21,452
and acknowledge the monster
that lives inside of him.

1120
01:28:29,971 --> 01:28:32,087
And to stop living in denial.

1121
01:28:44,486 --> 01:28:49,276
And we decided to keep this scene,
this beat without any music.

1122
01:28:49,366 --> 01:28:52,984
Because, you know, sometimes music--
It only kicks in here at the end,

1123
01:28:53,078 --> 01:28:56,321
but throughout the scene,
there's no music.

1124
01:28:56,414 --> 01:28:58,246
It tells you how you should feel
about a scene,

1125
01:28:58,333 --> 01:29:01,997
and we wanted this
to be very somber and raw.

1126
01:29:02,087 --> 01:29:04,545
You know, the man is dying.

1127
01:29:04,631 --> 01:29:08,625
He deserved to die at that point,

1128
01:29:08,718 --> 01:29:12,052
and we're not giving him a heroic death.

1129
01:29:12,138 --> 01:29:14,095
It's just-- It is what it is.

1130
01:29:14,182 --> 01:29:19,973
We're just witnessing how he slowly
fades away without glorifying anything.

1131
01:29:20,063 --> 01:29:22,930
And I think it works great.

1132
01:29:25,944 --> 01:29:30,359
I love this shot here.
This is a new beginning for her.

1133
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:33,531
Her performance is beautiful, too.

1134
01:29:33,618 --> 01:29:36,861
And what Pedro did with the light
in those shots is also amazing.

1135
01:29:56,099 --> 01:29:57,089
[Phoenix] Hey.

1136
01:29:59,185 --> 01:30:00,596
Hey.

1137
01:30:01,646 --> 01:30:03,557
Think there's room for one more?

1138
01:30:05,108 --> 01:30:06,189
I'm sure there is.

1139
01:30:08,153 --> 01:30:09,268
What's your name?

1140
01:30:13,992 --> 01:30:15,858
My name is Phoenix.

1141
01:30:15,952 --> 01:30:17,442
And there we go.

1142
01:30:17,537 --> 01:30:19,653
[rock music playing]

1143
01:30:21,374 --> 01:30:27,620
These final credits here,
our editing team put this together.

1144
01:30:27,714 --> 01:30:30,376
They did an amazing job.
I think they look beautiful.

1145
01:30:30,467 --> 01:30:32,458
[electric guitar playing]

1146
01:30:43,104 --> 01:30:49,521
By the way, that guitar playing there
in the back, that's me.

1147
01:30:49,611 --> 01:30:52,023
Roque Banos asked me to record it.

1148
01:30:52,113 --> 01:30:54,901
So it was a privilege
to be able to play that.

1149
01:31:00,830 --> 01:31:03,071
I love this one, particularly.

1150
01:31:03,166 --> 01:31:04,702
[rock music continues]

1151
01:31:28,733 --> 01:31:31,395
So there it is.

1152
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:35,605
Thank you guys so much.
I hope you enjoyed the movie.

1153
01:31:35,699 --> 01:31:38,316
Oh, we got this one coming. Yeah, sure.

1154
01:31:39,035 --> 01:31:41,402
The final coda.

1155
01:31:41,496 --> 01:31:44,909
Is he alive, huh? We don't know that.

1156
01:31:46,584 --> 01:31:47,289
Thank you, guys. Thank you, guys.

1157
01:31:47,293 --> 01:31:48,283
Thank you, guys. Thank you, guys.

1158
01:31:48,378 --> 01:31:51,541
I hope you enjoyed the movie
and you enjoyed this commentary.

1159
01:31:51,631 --> 01:31:54,214
And I hope to see you around soon.

1160
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:55,335
Thank you.
