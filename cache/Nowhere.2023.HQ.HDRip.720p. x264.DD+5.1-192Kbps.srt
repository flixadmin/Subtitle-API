
1
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:16,600
<i>It has now been seven months</i>

2
00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:18,975
<i>since Spain
began applying European measures</i>

3
00:00:19,059 --> 00:00:21,642
<i>to tackle the shortage of basic resources.</i>

4
00:00:21,725 --> 00:00:24,350
<i>The plan, called ''Not Enough for All,"</i>

5
00:00:24,434 --> 00:00:26,017
<i>has started to produce results.</i>

6
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,059
<i>But for now, Spain,
as well as its neighboring countries,</i>

7
00:00:29,142 --> 00:00:31,850
<i>won't be able
to sustain dependent citizens until--</i>

8
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:37,309
Get to your positions.
Come on. Same as last time.

9
00:00:37,392 --> 00:00:38,809
- Let's do this.
- Let's go.

10
00:00:38,892 --> 00:00:40,850
Meet back at the trucks.
Be careful, okay?

11
00:00:42,684 --> 00:00:44,326
- Let's go. Quickly and quietly.
- Run fast.

12
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:48,100
Bring your things. Hurry. Come on.
Come on. Move it. Move it. Go, go, go.

13
00:00:49,142 --> 00:00:51,725
- Come on. Come on, quickly.
- Come on, Mia. Let's go.

14
00:00:55,184 --> 00:00:56,767
- Hurry up. Quickly.
- Where?

15
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:57,850
This way.

16
00:01:04,684 --> 00:01:05,684
Move it.
Move it.

17
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,309
You two, follow me.
This way, guys. Come on!

18
00:01:12,934 --> 00:01:13,934
This way.

19
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:17,209
Faster.

20
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,600
Faster. Move it.

21
00:01:21,475 --> 00:01:23,850
Come on. Let's go.

22
00:01:26,517 --> 00:01:27,517
- You okay?
- No.

23
00:01:27,934 --> 00:01:29,100
Don't stop.
Let's go.

24
00:01:33,559 --> 00:01:35,559
That way.
Let's go. Come on. Move. You first.

25
00:01:35,642 --> 00:01:38,059
Okay.

26
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:49,434
- Nico.
- I'm here.

27
00:01:51,642 --> 00:01:53,868
- I don't fit. Fuck, I don't fit!
- You can do it.

28
00:01:53,892 --> 00:01:54,809
- Push me.
- Okay.

29
00:01:54,892 --> 00:01:56,434
Sorry.

30
00:01:58,934 --> 00:02:00,814
- Are you okay? Yeah, you're okay.
- What?

31
00:02:00,892 --> 00:02:02,809
Back up!

32
00:02:06,809 --> 00:02:07,809
Let's go.

33
00:02:08,392 --> 00:02:09,392
Come on.
Follow me.

34
00:02:11,809 --> 00:02:12,809
Hold my hand.

35
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,100
Come on.

36
00:02:17,142 --> 00:02:18,267
Let's go, love.

37
00:02:19,892 --> 00:02:21,392
Stay back, don't move.

38
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,600
Now!

39
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:28,975
Through here.
Almost there.

40
00:02:29,059 --> 00:02:31,410
<i>Attention!
Put your hands in the air!</i>

41
00:02:31,434 --> 00:02:33,017
<i>Stay where you are.</i>

42
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,392
<i>This is the police.
You are under arrest.</i>

43
00:02:36,475 --> 00:02:37,475
Give me the money.

44
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:39,892
You wait here.

45
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,892
- Are you okay?
- Okay.

46
00:02:45,309 --> 00:02:47,149
Didn't tell me about these two.
Bring 'em over.

47
00:02:47,225 --> 00:02:48,225
You, here.

48
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,100
It's fine.

49
00:02:51,892 --> 00:02:54,559
- Is anything wrong?
- The conditions are riskier than expected.

50
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:55,725
I need more money.

51
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:57,892
No, no, no.
We don't have any more money.

52
00:03:01,642 --> 00:03:02,767
I see how this works.

53
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,309
- Babe, give me your ring.
- No.

54
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:10,350
- Yes. You've got to.
- No. We gave them everything. Not my ring!

55
00:03:10,434 --> 00:03:12,392
Mia, we've got to leave now.

56
00:03:12,475 --> 00:03:13,475
Take it.

57
00:03:13,892 --> 00:03:14,892
Come on.

58
00:03:14,934 --> 00:03:17,059
Come on. We don't have all night.
Move it.

59
00:03:17,934 --> 00:03:18,934
Good.
This way.

60
00:03:19,392 --> 00:03:20,392
Safe travels.

61
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,809
We're gonna make it.

62
00:03:26,975 --> 00:03:29,017
There it is.
Our luxury liner.

63
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,100
Move it, asshole!

64
00:03:31,017 --> 00:03:32,160
- Come on.
- Let's go!

65
00:03:32,184 --> 00:03:33,184
Now!

66
00:03:42,725 --> 00:03:43,934
Step to the back.

67
00:03:44,434 --> 00:03:45,434
- Are you okay?
- No.

68
00:03:58,892 --> 00:04:00,059
<i>There's no food!</i>

69
00:04:00,142 --> 00:04:02,184
<i>We accepted
the discourse about shortages.</i>

70
00:04:02,267 --> 00:04:05,059
<i>We accepted that we had to make sacrifices
for the common good.</i>

71
00:04:05,142 --> 00:04:07,600
<i>We accepted
that measures would be temporary.</i>

72
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:08,934
<i>But what now?</i>

73
00:04:09,017 --> 00:04:10,892
<i>Look how far they've pushed us.</i>

74
00:04:10,975 --> 00:04:14,017
<i>First, they exterminated the elderly
to deal with the shortages.</i>

75
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,475
<i>Now they're targeting
pregnant women and kids.</i>

76
00:04:16,559 --> 00:04:19,517
<i>Don't you see it?
Pregnant women and kids!</i>

77
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,642
<i>The regime isn't ending shortages.</i>

78
00:04:21,725 --> 00:04:23,309
Is there anything else on?

79
00:04:23,392 --> 00:04:25,559
<i>There are alternatives
to this massacre.</i>

80
00:04:25,642 --> 00:04:28,559
<i>Countries like Ireland,
Iceland, and Norway have managed to stop...</i>

81
00:04:28,642 --> 00:04:30,475
- Yeah, take it off.
- Okay.

82
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:32,809
<i>Our country
must follow their example and help...</i>

83
00:04:34,392 --> 00:04:35,642
Let me see.

84
00:04:35,725 --> 00:04:37,392
Wow.

85
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,600
That's better.

86
00:04:40,684 --> 00:04:42,017
- Okay? Here.
- Yeah.

87
00:04:51,017 --> 00:04:52,475
Make him shut up.

88
00:05:04,934 --> 00:05:06,059
Where'd you get this?

89
00:05:06,142 --> 00:05:06,975
Ah...

90
00:05:07,059 --> 00:05:08,059
Tell me.

91
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:09,684
It's a secret.

92
00:05:10,934 --> 00:05:12,517
Let's not have it now.

93
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,809
Let's save it
and eat it when we get there.

94
00:05:14,892 --> 00:05:16,809
- To celebrate, right?
- Exactly.

95
00:05:22,017 --> 00:05:24,059
Do you think the regime will go there too?

96
00:05:25,184 --> 00:05:27,100
Ireland has ruled in opposition to it.

97
00:05:27,767 --> 00:05:30,184
Doesn't matter.
Governments are falling everywhere.

98
00:05:30,267 --> 00:05:32,517
- I'll tell you something about the Irish.
- What?

99
00:05:33,017 --> 00:05:34,892
It's impossible to overthrow them.

100
00:05:34,975 --> 00:05:37,267
- They drink dark beer.
- Right.

101
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,809
Ireland won't give in.

102
00:05:40,684 --> 00:05:42,684
You're allowed to be afraid, you know.

103
00:05:43,725 --> 00:05:46,559
Everything will work out, you'll see.
Hmm.

104
00:05:47,434 --> 00:05:49,517
- You don't know for sure.
- The worst part is over.

105
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,642
You don't know that.

106
00:05:52,309 --> 00:05:53,767
There's one thing I do know.

107
00:05:55,059 --> 00:05:56,059
What?

108
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,600
That I love you more than yesterday.

109
00:05:59,642 --> 00:06:00,892
But less than tomorrow.

110
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,184
What's happening?
Are we there?

111
00:06:27,975 --> 00:06:28,975
We're leaving.

112
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:36,684
Turn off the games.

113
00:06:45,434 --> 00:06:48,267
Do you think she's pregnant?
She's all alone.

114
00:06:53,725 --> 00:06:55,809
If she's pregnant, she's not alone.

115
00:07:03,892 --> 00:07:05,309
How's our little Noa doing?

116
00:07:06,809 --> 00:07:08,142
I didn't know we decided yet.

117
00:07:08,225 --> 00:07:10,309
Noa.

118
00:07:10,392 --> 00:07:13,017
- What do you wanna name her?
- I hope it isn't a girl.

119
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:14,725
I mean it.

120
00:07:15,642 --> 00:07:18,100
Well, I think she's a girl, a warrior.

121
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,350
Just like her mother.

122
00:07:20,434 --> 00:07:21,434
I don't feel her.

123
00:07:22,684 --> 00:07:23,684
What?

124
00:07:24,434 --> 00:07:26,600
She hasn't kicked me in two days.

125
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,142
That's not good.

126
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,017
Why didn't you tell me?

127
00:07:33,892 --> 00:07:34,892
Dunno.

128
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,350
What are you doing?

129
00:07:42,142 --> 00:07:43,142
Haven't you noticed?

130
00:07:44,225 --> 00:07:46,184
She always pushes right here.

131
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:48,559
I think this is a foot.

132
00:07:49,934 --> 00:07:50,934
How do you do it?

133
00:07:52,642 --> 00:07:53,642
What?

134
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,809
Act like everything's fine.

135
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,809
Like nothing's happened to us.

136
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:03,642
You know that's not true.

137
00:08:06,684 --> 00:08:08,142
- You know, don't you?
- Mm-hmm.

138
00:08:14,559 --> 00:08:16,142
You brought my duck!

139
00:08:16,225 --> 00:08:18,517
Hi, there.
What's wrong?

140
00:08:20,475 --> 00:08:22,267
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

141
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,350
No, no, no.
Don't cry.

142
00:08:25,309 --> 00:08:28,118
- What does the duck say?
- Shh. Don't cry. You're okay.

143
00:08:28,142 --> 00:08:29,475
- Shh.
- Nico.

144
00:08:29,559 --> 00:08:30,559
Yeah?

145
00:08:33,684 --> 00:08:34,934
What if she's alive,

146
00:08:35,517 --> 00:08:37,059
and we're leaving her behind?

147
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:40,059
All alone.

148
00:08:42,184 --> 00:08:43,184
She's not alive.

149
00:08:44,392 --> 00:08:45,392
They took her away,

150
00:08:46,517 --> 00:08:47,600
and they killed her.

151
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:55,934
Hmm.

152
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,535
Hey! Hey! Hey!

153
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:27,559
Nico! Nico!

154
00:09:28,892 --> 00:09:30,475
Mia!

155
00:09:31,184 --> 00:09:32,642
Come on, now!
Hurry up! Move it!

156
00:09:32,725 --> 00:09:34,142
Move it! Get in there now! Come on!

157
00:09:34,225 --> 00:09:36,725
What are you doin'?
Stop. There's too many. Back out!

158
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:38,434
- Nico! Nico!
- Mia!

159
00:09:40,184 --> 00:09:43,517
Listen up! There's too many of you.

160
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,184
There's another truck coming.

161
00:09:45,267 --> 00:09:47,725
- Half of you get out. Now!
- You heard him! It's too full.

162
00:09:47,809 --> 00:09:50,600
- Get some of 'em out!
- Come on! Come on! Get outta here!

163
00:09:50,684 --> 00:09:53,559
Mia! Mia! Mia!

164
00:09:53,642 --> 00:09:55,142
- Nico!
- Get out!

165
00:09:55,225 --> 00:09:56,951
- Wait! Mia!
- Come on, keep moving. Hey, you!

166
00:09:56,975 --> 00:09:58,684
You can't stay!

167
00:09:58,767 --> 00:10:01,350
Hey. Are you deaf or what?
Get off the truck.

168
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,975
No, no.
I was on this one, with my wife!

169
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:05,184
- Get out!
- Get out!

170
00:10:06,809 --> 00:10:08,725
- Nico!
- The rest move back.

171
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:11,600
- Stay back!
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Please! No!

172
00:10:21,517 --> 00:10:24,517
No. No, no, no.
Nico. No, no, no.

173
00:10:32,434 --> 00:10:34,559
Keep moving! Come on! To the back!

174
00:10:35,059 --> 00:10:37,267
Nico. Nico.

175
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:41,142
Nico.

176
00:10:41,225 --> 00:10:42,350
Nico.
No.

177
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:44,059
Nico, Nico.

178
00:10:44,142 --> 00:10:45,267
One-zero-seven green.

179
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,767
No. No, please. Wait, wait, wait.

180
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,559
<i>- Mia</i>.
- Babe, are you all right?

181
00:10:55,642 --> 00:10:57,100
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm fine.</i>

182
00:10:57,184 --> 00:10:58,809
- Okay, Nico.
- <i>Yeah?</i>

183
00:10:59,434 --> 00:11:02,767
- How will we find each other again?
<i>- We're okay. My truck is behind yours.</i>

184
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,267
- I can't do this alone.
- <i>What?</i>

185
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:06,517
No, no.
I can't do it alone, I really can't.

186
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,642
<i>Listen to me. You can't trust anyone.
Understand? Keep your things tucked away.</i>

187
00:11:10,725 --> 00:11:11,767
<i>Be careful, my love.</i>

188
00:11:12,267 --> 00:11:13,392
Yeah.

189
00:11:14,017 --> 00:11:15,657
<i>Did you hear me?</i>

190
00:11:15,725 --> 00:11:17,684
<i>Mia, are you there?
Mia!</i>

191
00:11:17,767 --> 00:11:19,184
Nico, listen to me.

192
00:11:19,267 --> 00:11:21,475
Are you sure they're taking us
to the same location?

193
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:23,600
<i>Yes, and when they stop, I'll escape.</i>

194
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:25,725
<i>Our ship is the only one
setting sail this week.</i>

195
00:11:25,809 --> 00:11:27,017
- Nico.
- <i>Yes?</i>

196
00:11:28,225 --> 00:11:29,642
I wanna be with you.

197
00:11:29,725 --> 00:11:30,934
<i>Me too.
I love you, Mia.</i>

198
00:11:31,017 --> 00:11:33,017
<i>Don't worry,
everything's gonna be all right.</i>

199
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,475
- Okay.
- <i>We're gonna be okay.</i>

200
00:11:34,975 --> 00:11:36,517
- Okay.
- <i>We'll talk soon, all right?</i>

201
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,434
Don't go yet, don't hang up.

202
00:11:38,517 --> 00:11:40,892
<i>Love, we can't waste our batteries.</i>

203
00:11:40,975 --> 00:11:42,350
Please don't hang up yet.

204
00:11:42,434 --> 00:11:44,517
<i>We'll be together again soon, you'll see.</i>

205
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,725
- Nico.
- <i>Yeah?</i>

206
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:49,850
Come soon.

207
00:11:49,934 --> 00:11:51,892
<i>I will.
As soon as I can.</i>

208
00:11:51,975 --> 00:11:53,017
Okay.

209
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,475
What makes you think
you're better than us?

210
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,309
Little girl, be quiet.

211
00:12:44,934 --> 00:12:45,934
GIVE US OUR CHILDREN BACK

212
00:12:46,017 --> 00:12:47,559
No, please, no!

213
00:12:51,017 --> 00:12:52,017
No...

214
00:12:59,309 --> 00:13:01,475
MURDERERS!
THIS IS NOT THE WAY

215
00:13:58,934 --> 00:14:00,267
What's going on?

216
00:14:02,434 --> 00:14:03,434
Hey.

217
00:14:06,475 --> 00:14:08,434
- What's going on?
- Move to the back.

218
00:14:09,309 --> 00:14:10,309
Don't talk.

219
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,850
How you doin'?

220
00:14:32,934 --> 00:14:33,975
Good, thanks.

221
00:14:34,059 --> 00:14:35,809
Step outside.
Bring your documents.

222
00:14:35,892 --> 00:14:37,184
Do I have to get out?

223
00:14:37,267 --> 00:14:39,267
- Transporting?
- Behind schedule.

224
00:14:40,809 --> 00:14:43,142
Very good.
Come with me to the back, please.

225
00:14:43,225 --> 00:14:44,267
Uh, sure.

226
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,517
This is the entire load?

227
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,600
Yes.

228
00:14:57,517 --> 00:14:59,017
You can't tell me what you're moving?

229
00:14:59,975 --> 00:15:01,767
Small load.
All in the manifest.

230
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,934
I know what it says.

231
00:15:04,475 --> 00:15:06,017
Problem is you don't.

232
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,475
Look, it's been a long week.
I log a lot of miles.

233
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:10,059
Lots of shipments.

234
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:11,142
Stop!

235
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,100
Is there a problem?

236
00:15:20,309 --> 00:15:21,600
Another one's pullin' in.

237
00:15:30,684 --> 00:15:31,684
He can park there.

238
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:35,892
Am I clear?

239
00:15:35,975 --> 00:15:36,975
You in a rush?

240
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:41,142
Uh, it's just if-- if I'm late,
I'll be penalized.

241
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,850
Well, I'm required
to check inside the truck.

242
00:15:44,434 --> 00:15:48,142
But is that necessary?
I'm barely carrying anything.

243
00:15:48,225 --> 00:15:50,725
Don't worry about it.
I'll write you a note.

244
00:16:50,934 --> 00:16:51,975
Travis, back here.

245
00:17:19,642 --> 00:17:20,934
Do it!

246
00:17:35,642 --> 00:17:37,392
Great, thank you.

247
00:17:37,475 --> 00:17:38,475
Well done.

248
00:17:40,475 --> 00:17:41,475
You can come out now.

249
00:17:42,392 --> 00:17:44,559
Don't be afraid.
We won't hurt you.

250
00:17:46,475 --> 00:17:47,892
You won't come out?

251
00:17:58,017 --> 00:18:00,809
I know that the austerity measures
have been cruel.

252
00:18:00,892 --> 00:18:03,392
They're especially hard
on women and children.

253
00:18:03,475 --> 00:18:06,600
I understand
if you don't think you can trust me.

254
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,350
It's hard to know
who to trust, right? Hmm?

255
00:18:10,434 --> 00:18:12,850
Not those who forced you
into this container.

256
00:18:12,934 --> 00:18:15,215
They stuffed you in here
with barely enough air to breathe

257
00:18:15,267 --> 00:18:17,642
and robbed you
of all the money you had left.

258
00:18:17,725 --> 00:18:19,017
And they promised you...

259
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,975
...you could have a better life
in a better place.

260
00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:24,142
They lied.

261
00:18:24,225 --> 00:18:25,975
A better place doesn't exist.

262
00:18:26,059 --> 00:18:27,225
So you should come out.

263
00:18:27,934 --> 00:18:30,142
Because if you don't,
I'll have to shoot.

264
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:34,767
Damn it. Don't make me give that order.
I've had to give it so many times.

265
00:18:35,975 --> 00:18:38,017
I can save your lives.

266
00:18:40,517 --> 00:18:41,517
Well, I tried.

267
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,309
Come.
Take my hand.

268
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,559
Hey! Good for you!

269
00:19:07,392 --> 00:19:09,184
Come on up! Take my hand!

270
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,850
All right, boys.
You know what to do.

271
00:19:42,725 --> 00:19:44,934
Puppy!

272
00:19:58,059 --> 00:20:00,892
Get the bodies out of here
and get rid of all their shit.

273
00:20:15,767 --> 00:20:16,934
Take this one.

274
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,267
Good enough. Let's go.

275
00:20:23,642 --> 00:20:25,267
- All good, boss.
- Great.

276
00:20:50,434 --> 00:20:54,559
Nico. You've gotta hide.
Hide, Nico.

277
00:20:54,642 --> 00:20:55,767
They killed everyone.

278
00:20:56,975 --> 00:21:01,184
You've gotta hide.
They're gonna kill you. Hide, Nico.

279
00:21:57,642 --> 00:22:00,850
<i>Hello, this is Nico.
I can't talk now, but try me again later.</i>

280
00:22:11,225 --> 00:22:12,225
Nico.

281
00:22:13,809 --> 00:22:15,434
I'm okay and I'm at the port.

282
00:22:15,517 --> 00:22:16,767
Where are you?

283
00:22:17,392 --> 00:22:19,309
Where are you?
Why don't you pick up?

284
00:22:20,892 --> 00:22:21,934
Just call me.

285
00:24:05,434 --> 00:24:07,934
- Watch out, it's gonna come loose.
- Help!

286
00:24:09,309 --> 00:24:11,017
I need help!

287
00:24:14,975 --> 00:24:16,642
Come on, let's go!

288
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,892
It's gonna fall!
Watch out!

289
00:24:26,975 --> 00:24:27,975
Please help!

290
00:24:29,392 --> 00:24:32,225
Hey! Hey! I'm in here!

291
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:35,142
Let me out!
Please, I'm here!

292
00:24:35,225 --> 00:24:36,684
Hey!
Hey!

293
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:37,934
I'm in here!

294
00:24:47,934 --> 00:24:48,934
Help!

295
00:24:49,017 --> 00:24:50,975
- Help!
- It's going to fall!

296
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:52,059
Please, help me!

297
00:24:52,142 --> 00:24:55,850
- Is somebody there?
- Yes, I'm here! Help me, please!

298
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:21,850
God.

299
00:25:39,267 --> 00:25:40,267
Help.

300
00:26:44,517 --> 00:26:45,517
What?

301
00:27:05,767 --> 00:27:07,684
No, no, no, no. No.

302
00:27:08,475 --> 00:27:09,475
No way.

303
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,600
Please.

304
00:27:45,142 --> 00:27:47,100
Please.
Please.

305
00:27:47,184 --> 00:27:48,350
Aw, come on.

306
00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:06,517
ENTER PIN NUMBER

307
00:28:12,725 --> 00:28:13,725
INCORRECT PIN

308
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,350
PIN BLOCKED

309
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,350
Okay.

310
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,100
Fuck.

311
00:29:31,475 --> 00:29:32,517
Shit.

312
00:29:39,225 --> 00:29:41,267
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

313
00:30:38,309 --> 00:30:39,309
Oh, no.

314
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:01,725
What?

315
00:31:02,934 --> 00:31:04,142
Hey!

316
00:31:04,934 --> 00:31:05,934
Hey!

317
00:31:08,225 --> 00:31:09,267
Nico, I'm over here!

318
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:10,767
Nico!

319
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:12,475
Over here!

320
00:31:12,975 --> 00:31:14,100
No, no, no!

321
00:31:14,184 --> 00:31:15,184
Hey!

322
00:31:16,017 --> 00:31:18,225
Nico!
Nico!

323
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:20,975
Nico!

324
00:31:22,017 --> 00:31:22,934
Nico!

325
00:31:23,017 --> 00:31:26,100
Where are you?
Hang on! Just hang on! Wait.

326
00:31:27,642 --> 00:31:28,684
Okay.

327
00:31:33,142 --> 00:31:34,142
Nico!

328
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,725
Wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait!

329
00:31:39,934 --> 00:31:41,100
Wait.
Wait!

330
00:31:42,225 --> 00:31:43,225
Nico!

331
00:31:44,017 --> 00:31:45,642
It's me.
Come on, answer the phone.

332
00:31:45,725 --> 00:31:48,475
Please, answer me.
No, no, no, no.

333
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:49,892
No!

334
00:31:49,975 --> 00:31:51,225
No! Please, I'm here!

335
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:53,434
No!

336
00:31:55,684 --> 00:31:58,434
<i>Hello, this is Nico.
I can't talk now, but try me again later.</i>

337
00:32:48,392 --> 00:32:51,142
<i>Hello, this is Nico.
I can't talk now, but try me again later.</i>

338
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:57,684
<i>Hello, this is Nico.
I can't talk now, but try me again later.</i>

339
00:33:03,184 --> 00:33:06,059
<i>Hello, this is Nico.
I can't talk now, but try me again later.</i>

340
00:33:46,517 --> 00:33:47,517
Huh.

341
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:49,059
Huh?

342
00:33:53,767 --> 00:33:54,934
Are you there?

343
00:33:59,475 --> 00:34:00,475
No.

344
00:34:03,725 --> 00:34:04,725
No.

345
00:34:09,892 --> 00:34:10,892
Hello?

346
00:34:18,225 --> 00:34:19,225
Hi.

347
00:35:52,434 --> 00:35:53,934
No! What?

348
00:35:55,309 --> 00:35:56,309
What's happening?

349
00:36:32,684 --> 00:36:33,684
Okay.

350
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:44,434
Come on.

351
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,600
Come on!

352
00:37:03,225 --> 00:37:04,934
Really?
More Tupperware?

353
00:37:06,434 --> 00:37:08,225
Fucking Tupperware!
Shit.

354
00:37:23,767 --> 00:37:24,767
Okay.

355
00:37:28,642 --> 00:37:29,725
Brilliant.

356
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:04,850
DAY 2

357
00:38:12,184 --> 00:38:13,767
MAXIMUM

358
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:14,850
All right.

359
00:38:17,892 --> 00:38:19,767
911

360
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,600
Hello?

361
00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:28,559
No signal.

362
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,975
What? Oh!

363
00:39:09,059 --> 00:39:10,559
UNKNOWN NUMBER

364
00:39:10,642 --> 00:39:13,392
<i>- Mia. Mia, sweetheart.</i>
- Nico?

365
00:39:13,475 --> 00:39:15,475
- <i>Yes.</i>
- Oh! Oh!

366
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:17,017
<i>Oh my God!
Thank God!</i>

367
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:20,184
Nico, I didn't think you were alive.
Love, are you okay?

368
00:39:20,267 --> 00:39:22,100
<i>I'm sorry I couldn't call.
My battery ran out.</i>

369
00:39:22,184 --> 00:39:24,809
<i>The driver fucked us over.
He left us outside the city limits.</i>

370
00:39:24,892 --> 00:39:26,309
<i>It'll take a few days to catch up.</i>

371
00:39:26,392 --> 00:39:28,434
No. Listen to me.
Something's happening to me, Nico.

372
00:39:28,517 --> 00:39:31,267
- <i>What's wrong?</i>
- I'm trapped in here and I can't get out.

373
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:33,517
<i>I'm coming to you.
I'm coming. I'll be there soon.</i>

374
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,975
No, no, no. You've gotta listen to me.
I'm not... You won't...

375
00:39:37,059 --> 00:39:38,267
<i>What?
What's going on?</i>

376
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:39,517
I'm not on the boat.

377
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,559
- <i>What do you mean?</i>
- I'm not on the boat.

378
00:39:41,642 --> 00:39:44,559
- My container's in the ocean.
- <i>Wait. Your-- What? Where are you?</i>

379
00:39:45,142 --> 00:39:48,684
I don't know. I'm floating in the ocean.
I'm drifting. I don't know where.

380
00:39:48,767 --> 00:39:50,809
I'm okay for now,
but the water's seeping in.

381
00:39:50,892 --> 00:39:54,267
<i>Oh my God, Mia.
Can you see anything outside?</i>

382
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,785
Yes, I can see, but all there is is water.
There's just water.

383
00:39:56,809 --> 00:39:58,609
- <i>There's nothing else?</i>
- Nothing. Just water.

384
00:39:58,642 --> 00:40:00,767
- I'm in the middle of the ocean, Nico.
- <i>Fuck!</i>

385
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,434
Say something.
I'm scared.

386
00:40:05,267 --> 00:40:09,059
<i>Just don't worry, Mia.
I'll rescue you. I promise.</i>

387
00:40:09,142 --> 00:40:10,850
- Nico...
- <i>Just try to hang in there.</i>

388
00:40:10,934 --> 00:40:13,142
- I'm trying, but I...
- <i>Do it for the baby.</i>

389
00:40:13,225 --> 00:40:15,184
I don't think I can do this much longer.

390
00:40:15,267 --> 00:40:17,187
- <i>You can do it.</i>
- I just miss her so much, Nico.

391
00:40:17,225 --> 00:40:18,309
<i>No, no, no, no.
No, no.</i>

392
00:40:18,392 --> 00:40:21,142
- <i>My love, don't do this. Not now.</i>
- I messed up again.

393
00:40:21,975 --> 00:40:24,017
<i>It's not your fault.
Do you understand?</i>

394
00:40:24,517 --> 00:40:26,684
<i>What happened to Uma was not your fault.</i>

395
00:40:26,767 --> 00:40:27,975
- <i>Sweetheart.</i>
- It wasn't?

396
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:30,767
<i>You're the strongest person
I've ever known.</i>

397
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:32,642
- <i>Promise you won't give up?</i>
- Yes.

398
00:40:33,475 --> 00:40:34,725
- <i>Mia...</i>
- Yeah?

399
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:37,184
<i>I love you more than yesterday.</i>

400
00:40:38,142 --> 00:40:39,559
But less than tomorrow.

401
00:40:39,642 --> 00:40:42,392
<i>I will call you
as soon as I figure out a plan.</i>

402
00:40:42,475 --> 00:40:44,350
- Find me. Bye.
- <i>Don't lose your phone.</i>

403
00:40:57,392 --> 00:41:00,725
Oh no, no, no, no, no. Not now.
Not now. Don't do this right now.

404
00:41:00,809 --> 00:41:03,350
Just wait.
Help Mommy and wait.

405
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,809
Daddy's on his way.
Wait for Daddy to come.

406
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,934
No. No, no, no.

407
00:41:57,725 --> 00:41:59,767
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

408
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:05,642
Please, please wait. Wait a bit longer.
Please wait, please wait a little longer.

409
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:10,892
I wanted you to wait!

410
00:42:15,559 --> 00:42:16,559
Nico!

411
00:42:19,309 --> 00:42:20,309
No!

412
00:42:23,725 --> 00:42:25,517
Ah! No, no, no!

413
00:42:26,767 --> 00:42:27,767
No!

414
00:44:20,767 --> 00:44:23,142
What? Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

415
00:44:25,309 --> 00:44:29,017
Breathe, please. Please.
Come on.

416
00:44:29,517 --> 00:44:31,892
Come on, breathe.
Breathe. Breathe.

417
00:44:34,225 --> 00:44:35,225
Oh please, breathe.

418
00:45:27,517 --> 00:45:28,559
Mm-hmm.

419
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:38,642
Oh!
Oh!

420
00:46:08,392 --> 00:46:11,809
DAY 2

421
00:46:12,392 --> 00:46:14,184
DAY 3

422
00:46:15,184 --> 00:46:16,892
Honey. Sweetie.

423
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:19,142
What's wrong?

424
00:46:20,517 --> 00:46:22,100
Want a fresh diaper?
Yes?

425
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,684
All right, all right.
It's okay. I can hear you.

426
00:46:27,767 --> 00:46:29,350
You're so loud.
I know, I know.

427
00:46:29,434 --> 00:46:32,934
You're hungry, aren't you?
Okay, it's coming. That's right. Hang on.

428
00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:36,850
It's coming.

429
00:46:38,767 --> 00:46:41,100
Come on, sweetie.
I know you're hungry.

430
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:42,850
Come on, lovie.

431
00:46:43,684 --> 00:46:45,559
You're hungry, but you won't eat.

432
00:46:46,725 --> 00:46:47,559
It's okay.

433
00:46:47,642 --> 00:46:50,600
Okay, okay, okay.
Everything's all right.

434
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:55,392
Mommy needs to eat too.

435
00:46:58,225 --> 00:46:59,309
Mm...

436
00:47:09,809 --> 00:47:12,892
No fucking way.
Fuck.

437
00:47:20,017 --> 00:47:21,767
Yes, I know, I know, it's okay.

438
00:47:23,642 --> 00:47:26,309
All right.
Come on.

439
00:47:29,934 --> 00:47:32,725
Honey, why won't you eat?
Okay...

440
00:47:37,184 --> 00:47:39,059
Hey, listen, listen, listen, listen.

441
00:47:39,142 --> 00:47:42,100
Your job is to eat,
and my job is to take care of you, okay?

442
00:47:42,184 --> 00:47:44,809
We're gonna get out of here, promise.

443
00:47:44,892 --> 00:47:46,684
Please don't be so sad, honey.

444
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:10,725
Hey! That's enough now!

445
00:48:10,809 --> 00:48:14,767
I have to do this so we can get out
of here and get some help. Okay?

446
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:16,100
Be quiet and let me work!

447
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:17,934
Try to be patient for me, please.

448
00:48:27,642 --> 00:48:29,267
Okay.
I'm coming.

449
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:32,850
Okay, my love.
I'm here.

450
00:48:33,517 --> 00:48:34,809
Honey, it's okay.

451
00:48:34,892 --> 00:48:36,725
Okay.
You're starving.

452
00:48:40,267 --> 00:48:41,267
Honey...

453
00:48:42,892 --> 00:48:46,975
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on. Come on.

454
00:48:47,059 --> 00:48:51,100
Be quiet! Stop! Stop this! Enough!

455
00:48:51,184 --> 00:48:53,767
You have to eat or you will die!
You wanna die?

456
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:55,225
Huh?
Is that what you want?

457
00:48:59,267 --> 00:49:01,142
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, baby.

458
00:49:01,225 --> 00:49:04,475
Mommy loves you.
I'm sorry. Forgive me. I didn't mean it.

459
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:05,975
I'm gonna take care of you.

460
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:08,767
I know, I know.

461
00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:10,017
I'm so sorry.

462
00:49:11,267 --> 00:49:12,267
It's all right.

463
00:49:32,267 --> 00:49:33,767
Come here, my little warrior.

464
00:49:35,059 --> 00:49:36,434
Let's try again.
Okay?

465
00:49:36,517 --> 00:49:37,517
Still hungry?

466
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:40,392
I know, and we're gonna try again.

467
00:49:42,767 --> 00:49:46,225
You've been waiting for so long.
I'm sorry it took so long.

468
00:49:46,309 --> 00:49:47,975
I know, I know, I know.

469
00:49:48,892 --> 00:49:49,892
Ready?

470
00:49:51,517 --> 00:49:53,309
Here we go, sweetheart.

471
00:49:53,392 --> 00:49:54,392
That's it.

472
00:49:54,767 --> 00:49:56,642
Latch on for Mommy.

473
00:50:15,725 --> 00:50:17,267
Keep drinking for Mommy.

474
00:50:18,892 --> 00:50:20,059
Mommy's milk came.

475
00:50:21,225 --> 00:50:22,225
Finally.

476
00:50:23,850 --> 00:50:24,850
That's right.

477
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:30,267
Good girl.
We're good, we're good, we're good.

478
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:53,100
Mm...

479
00:50:53,767 --> 00:50:54,767
Mm.

480
00:52:00,975 --> 00:52:02,100
Come on!

481
00:52:16,017 --> 00:52:18,434
All right.
Almost there.

482
00:52:23,392 --> 00:52:25,725
Huh?
What's going on?

483
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:28,559
No. Come on!

484
00:52:29,559 --> 00:52:30,850
Please work.

485
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:32,600
Let's go.

486
00:52:33,517 --> 00:52:34,517
Come on!

487
00:52:36,934 --> 00:52:37,934
No.

488
00:52:38,767 --> 00:52:39,809
No!

489
00:52:53,934 --> 00:52:54,934
No...

490
00:53:27,392 --> 00:53:29,017
Yes!

491
00:53:30,767 --> 00:53:31,767
Come on.

492
00:53:32,934 --> 00:53:34,517
No.
No.

493
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,309
Please work.
Come on, work!

494
00:53:39,059 --> 00:53:40,642
Come back!
Please!

495
00:53:40,725 --> 00:53:42,309
Don't do this to me!

496
00:53:42,392 --> 00:53:45,184
Ugh! Come on!
No! No. no. no. Hey!

497
00:53:45,267 --> 00:53:46,267
Ugh.

498
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:47,350
No!

499
00:54:40,434 --> 00:54:43,809
It's all right.
It's all right, sweetie. I know.

500
00:54:45,267 --> 00:54:48,725
That's better, isn't it?
Shh, there, that's better.

501
00:54:49,517 --> 00:54:50,559
Much, much better.

502
00:55:08,225 --> 00:55:09,225
Mm...

503
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:13,100
Hm...

504
00:55:14,892 --> 00:55:15,892
Mm...

505
00:55:53,267 --> 00:55:54,267
Eh...

506
00:56:56,184 --> 00:56:57,767
I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.

507
00:56:57,850 --> 00:57:01,059
Don't cry. It's okay.
I'm here, sweetie. Mommy's here.

508
00:57:01,767 --> 00:57:03,267
Don't worry.
I'm here.

509
00:57:06,892 --> 00:57:08,809
Don't be afraid.
It's okay, it's okay.

510
00:57:12,309 --> 00:57:13,309
Okay.

511
00:57:18,934 --> 00:57:19,934
Go away!

512
00:57:20,267 --> 00:57:21,517
Get outta here!

513
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:41,475
Okay.
It's gone.

514
00:57:42,934 --> 00:57:44,684
I've got you.
I'm here.

515
00:57:45,975 --> 00:57:46,975
It's gone.

516
00:57:49,059 --> 00:57:50,059
It's gone.

517
00:57:52,059 --> 00:57:53,184
DAY 6

518
00:58:08,017 --> 00:58:09,017
Huh?

519
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:26,600
Mm.

520
01:00:21,684 --> 01:00:24,142
- Mommy?
- Uma, my darling.

521
01:00:25,725 --> 01:00:27,559
Uma, please come here.

522
01:00:28,434 --> 01:00:30,642
Come closer. Please.
I wanna see you.

523
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:38,934
Hi, honey.

524
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:42,475
Mommy, can we go home now, please?

525
01:00:44,017 --> 01:00:46,225
I miss you so much, Uma.

526
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:49,225
Mommy, why did you let them take me away?

527
01:00:50,475 --> 01:00:51,517
I'm sorry.

528
01:00:55,517 --> 01:00:56,517
I'm sorry.

529
01:00:57,725 --> 01:00:58,934
It was my fault.

530
01:01:00,350 --> 01:01:03,475
I just wanted to play with the airplane.

531
01:01:05,517 --> 01:01:07,725
I know, it was a mistake.

532
01:01:20,934 --> 01:01:21,975
No, stay.

533
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:25,559
I'm sorry.

534
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:30,475
It was my fault.
I messed up.

535
01:01:33,850 --> 01:01:34,934
I'm sorry.

536
01:01:39,350 --> 01:01:40,600
It wasn't your fault.

537
01:01:52,642 --> 01:01:53,767
It wasn't your fault.

538
01:02:59,184 --> 01:03:01,225
Mommy will get you out of here, okay?

539
01:05:09,642 --> 01:05:12,267
Sweetheart.
Look at the world.

540
01:05:14,434 --> 01:05:16,184
Up above is the sky.

541
01:05:16,267 --> 01:05:18,100
Down below is the sea.

542
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:21,975
And very far over there
is where we're going.

543
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:28,475
Nico, where are you?

544
01:05:40,142 --> 01:05:41,684
Feels good to be outside, right?

545
01:05:42,184 --> 01:05:44,559
Yeah, you seem much happier.

546
01:05:44,642 --> 01:05:46,350
You like the sun and fresh air.

547
01:06:07,725 --> 01:06:09,184
This way.
Over here.

548
01:06:09,267 --> 01:06:10,267
Here.

549
01:06:10,934 --> 01:06:12,725
Come on. Over here.
This way.

550
01:07:59,392 --> 01:08:00,600
Here.
I'm here.

551
01:08:42,559 --> 01:08:46,142
Shh! It's okay, my love.
I'm here. It's okay. It's okay.

552
01:08:46,225 --> 01:08:47,350
I'm here.
I'm here.

553
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:09,850
Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God.

554
01:09:11,475 --> 01:09:12,517
I've got this.

555
01:09:33,642 --> 01:09:35,475
Oh.

556
01:09:37,350 --> 01:09:38,475
Don't worry, sweetie.

557
01:11:11,392 --> 01:11:12,392
Come on.

558
01:11:12,934 --> 01:11:15,475
Come on, come on.

559
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:19,100
Come on.

560
01:11:20,350 --> 01:11:22,892
Come on, come on.
Come, come, come, come.

561
01:11:25,934 --> 01:11:26,934
Come on.

562
01:11:29,934 --> 01:11:31,225
Come on.

563
01:11:52,184 --> 01:11:55,059
Don't give me that look. I'm desperate.
You know what it feels like.

564
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:08,392
MAXIMUM

565
01:12:08,475 --> 01:12:12,975
DAY 9

566
01:12:48,559 --> 01:12:50,809
Good job.
You're Mommy's big girl.

567
01:12:54,017 --> 01:12:55,184
It's mini bath time.

568
01:13:17,475 --> 01:13:20,475
Where are you? Where are you?
Call me. Come on, Nico. Call me.

569
01:13:20,559 --> 01:13:22,517
Call me, please.
Call me!

570
01:13:46,767 --> 01:13:50,517
DAY 12

571
01:14:09,475 --> 01:14:10,725
Look, this is me.

572
01:14:10,809 --> 01:14:11,809
At school.

573
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:15,725
With one of my students.
Did I tell you I'm a teacher?

574
01:14:16,934 --> 01:14:19,434
This is your daddy.
His name's Nico.

575
01:14:19,517 --> 01:14:21,350
He's at work, in our store.

576
01:14:22,684 --> 01:14:26,309
We were forced to close the store
because there wasn't much food to sell.

577
01:14:26,809 --> 01:14:31,559
At the end, there wasn't anything at all.
But people came to visit him anyway.

578
01:14:32,142 --> 01:14:33,600
Because he cared about them.

579
01:14:33,684 --> 01:14:36,475
I know he'll find a way
to get us out of here

580
01:14:36,559 --> 01:14:39,892
because...
he always knows what to do.

581
01:14:44,767 --> 01:14:47,017
This is your grandma, Noa.

582
01:14:47,975 --> 01:14:50,017
Do you like that name?
Noa.

583
01:14:50,809 --> 01:14:52,017
I think it's beautiful.

584
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:54,642
It means "long life." Spelled with an H.

585
01:14:55,684 --> 01:14:57,225
But it's prettier without it.

586
01:14:57,309 --> 01:14:59,517
In Noah's Ark, that's a story,

587
01:15:00,434 --> 01:15:02,225
they survived and got to land.

588
01:15:04,434 --> 01:15:07,100
There are animals in it.
I'll read it to you some day.

589
01:15:11,767 --> 01:15:12,809
This is Uma.

590
01:15:13,975 --> 01:15:15,850
You wanna know about her, don't you?

591
01:15:20,350 --> 01:15:23,434
Well, you know,
you have the same eyes as she did.

592
01:15:23,517 --> 01:15:24,517
Exactly.

593
01:15:24,892 --> 01:15:27,892
And when she was a baby,
the shape of her face was just like yours.

594
01:15:27,975 --> 01:15:30,350
She wanted to be an airplane pilot.

595
01:15:30,850 --> 01:15:33,059
She liked to say "airplane pilot."

596
01:15:33,642 --> 01:15:35,309
You would've had fun with her.

597
01:15:38,684 --> 01:15:40,309
What happened is that when...

598
01:15:43,517 --> 01:15:45,184
...when the regime took over,

599
01:15:45,267 --> 01:15:47,809
we were forced to lock ourselves
inside the house.

600
01:15:47,892 --> 01:15:50,350
And your daddy would go out
to get us food.

601
01:15:51,184 --> 01:15:53,725
At first, it was fine,
but as time went on...

602
01:15:56,850 --> 01:15:59,392
Uma wanted to go outside because...

603
01:16:01,642 --> 01:16:04,350
because a girl can't stand
being locked up for too long

604
01:16:05,517 --> 01:16:07,184
in her house, you know.

605
01:16:12,684 --> 01:16:14,559
There wasn't enough room to play,

606
01:16:15,934 --> 01:16:17,309
so one day,

607
01:16:18,975 --> 01:16:21,850
she kept begging me
and insisting we go out.

608
01:16:24,017 --> 01:16:25,267
And, um,

609
01:16:25,850 --> 01:16:27,184
I said, "Okay."

610
01:16:28,517 --> 01:16:31,225
We were only outside five minutes,
but they took her.

611
01:16:40,934 --> 01:16:41,934
It was all my fault.

612
01:16:42,725 --> 01:16:43,975
I should've known better.

613
01:16:46,267 --> 01:16:47,350
I messed up.

614
01:17:07,934 --> 01:17:09,684
What's wrong?

615
01:17:10,475 --> 01:17:12,517
What's wrong? Are you okay?

616
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,059
You're freezing.

617
01:17:26,434 --> 01:17:27,434
There we are.

618
01:17:33,934 --> 01:17:36,225
You're snug as a bug in a rug like that.

619
01:17:37,225 --> 01:17:38,684
My beanie looks cute on you.

620
01:17:41,517 --> 01:17:43,559
You'll feel much better tomorrow, okay?

621
01:17:44,725 --> 01:17:45,934
You're all bundled up.

622
01:17:47,350 --> 01:17:48,475
Warm and cozy.

01:20:14,434 --> 01:20:15,559
DAY 12

634
01:20:17,434 --> 01:20:19,100
No, no, no.

635
01:20:19,184 --> 01:20:20,975
MAXIMUM

636
01:21:04,934 --> 01:21:06,600
Nico!
Nico!

637
01:21:06,684 --> 01:21:08,767
Oh, come on, come on, connect.
Please, come on.

638
01:21:08,850 --> 01:21:11,642
Please work.
Come on, connect. Connect.

639
01:21:13,142 --> 01:21:14,767
Nico.
Nico.

640
01:21:14,850 --> 01:21:16,809
<i>- Mia.</i>
- Can you hear me?

641
01:21:16,892 --> 01:21:19,475
- <i>Uh, yes, at last.</i>
- It's finally you, my love.

642
01:21:19,559 --> 01:21:20,934
I'm so sorry I couldn't call you.

643
01:21:21,017 --> 01:21:23,267
I didn't have a signal.
And my cell is broken.

644
01:21:23,350 --> 01:21:25,850
No, no, I mean the screen is broken.
Where are you?

645
01:21:25,934 --> 01:21:28,225
- <i>Listen to me, please, my love.</i>
- What's wrong, Nico?

646
01:21:29,434 --> 01:21:31,100
<i>I won't be able to come for you.</i>

647
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,309
<i>You'll have to make it on your own.</i>

648
01:21:34,559 --> 01:21:35,559
<i>Promise me you will.</i>

649
01:21:37,184 --> 01:21:38,184
<i>Promise.</i>

650
01:21:38,684 --> 01:21:40,392
Nico, what's wrong?

651
01:21:40,975 --> 01:21:43,559
Please, Nico. I'm scared. What's wrong?

652
01:21:43,642 --> 01:21:44,684
My love, tell me.

653
01:21:48,725 --> 01:21:51,517
- Nico...
- <i>I'm... I'm hiding in a container.</i>

654
01:21:52,392 --> 01:21:56,475
<i>I snuck onto a ship, but they found me.</i>

655
01:21:57,142 --> 01:21:59,059
<i>And when I ran, they shot me.</i>

656
01:22:01,059 --> 01:22:02,309
Are you hurt?

657
01:22:03,559 --> 01:22:05,017
<i>I'm losing so much blood.</i>

658
01:22:05,934 --> 01:22:07,434
- What?
- <i>My love...</i>

659
01:22:09,184 --> 01:22:12,392
- Honey?
<i>- I just... I just wanted to say goodbye.</i>

660
01:22:14,809 --> 01:22:17,059
<i>And I want you to know that I fought hard.</i>

661
01:22:17,975 --> 01:22:20,392
<i>I fought hard.
As hard as I could.</i>

662
01:22:21,767 --> 01:22:22,975
<i>I promise I did.</i>

663
01:22:23,059 --> 01:22:25,684
<i>And... you were right.</i>

664
01:22:26,184 --> 01:22:27,559
<i>You were always right.</i>

665
01:22:28,392 --> 01:22:29,642
<i>I'm too optimistic.</i>

666
01:22:30,475 --> 01:22:31,850
<i>We should've stayed.</i>

667
01:22:33,017 --> 01:22:35,767
- No. No. Nico, listen to me.
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>

668
01:22:35,850 --> 01:22:37,130
- Listen to me, Nico.
- <i>So sorry.</i>

669
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:38,475
Please, my love, listen to me.

670
01:22:38,559 --> 01:22:40,684
- You saved our lives.
- <i>How?</i>

671
01:22:40,767 --> 01:22:43,975
- Understand?
- <i>How? You said "our lives"?</i>

672
01:22:44,059 --> 01:22:45,767
Yes, my love, she's here.

673
01:22:48,350 --> 01:22:50,684
She's here, Nico.
She was born.

674
01:22:52,809 --> 01:22:54,517
She's a beautiful little girl.

675
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:56,059
- <i>That's amazing.</i>
- Yeah.

676
01:22:56,142 --> 01:22:58,309
<i>A girl, huh?
See, I knew it.</i>

677
01:22:59,475 --> 01:23:00,559
<i>Are you okay?</i>

678
01:23:00,642 --> 01:23:03,809
- Yeah. We're both fine. We're both fine.
- <i>I wish I were with you.</i>

679
01:23:03,892 --> 01:23:07,142
You're here, Nico.
You are. You've been here the whole time.

680
01:23:07,225 --> 01:23:09,517
You were here during my labor,

681
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:12,309
you were here
when I finally opened the container.

682
01:23:14,225 --> 01:23:16,184
I promised I wouldn't give up
and I fought.

683
01:23:16,267 --> 01:23:20,392
I fought so hard.
And you're here when I sing to her.

684
01:23:20,475 --> 01:23:21,809
You're always here with me.

685
01:23:21,892 --> 01:23:25,392
- <i>What? You, sing?</i>
- Yes.

686
01:23:27,267 --> 01:23:30,392
<i>Sweetheart,</i>
<i>what does she look like?</i>

687
01:23:32,642 --> 01:23:33,642
She looks like you.

688
01:23:33,725 --> 01:23:36,809
She's so beautiful,
she's strong, and funny.

689
01:23:36,892 --> 01:23:39,767
She makes me laugh,
she's caring just like you.

690
01:23:40,475 --> 01:23:42,100
You know what?
She's right here.

691
01:23:42,934 --> 01:23:46,475
I'll put the phone next to her
so she can hear your voice.

692
01:23:46,559 --> 01:23:48,059
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Sweet pea,

693
01:23:48,142 --> 01:23:49,600
your daddy wants to talk to you.

694
01:23:49,684 --> 01:23:51,684
He's on the phone.
Say something.

695
01:23:54,142 --> 01:23:57,725
<i>Hello, how's my princess?
I'm your daddy.</i>

696
01:23:59,059 --> 01:24:02,100
<i>I'm the pesky guy
who pushed your foot all the time</i>

697
01:24:02,184 --> 01:24:04,100
<i>when you were in your mommy's tummy.</i>

698
01:24:05,350 --> 01:24:07,642
<i>Okay.
Now listen.</i>

699
01:24:08,767 --> 01:24:10,267
<i>I'm gonna tell you a secret.</i>

700
01:24:12,017 --> 01:24:14,892
<i>If you ever feel sad
and confused about life,</i>

701
01:24:15,809 --> 01:24:19,809
<i>close your eyes
and sit in your mom's lap for a while.</i>

702
01:24:20,975 --> 01:24:26,184
<i>You'll see that when you're in her arms,
everything's all right. Always.</i>

703
01:24:31,184 --> 01:24:32,934
Did you hear her?
She's brilliant.

704
01:24:34,642 --> 01:24:35,809
Her name is Noa.

705
01:24:36,767 --> 01:24:37,767
<i>Noa?</i>

706
01:24:39,184 --> 01:24:40,184
<i>Are you sure?</i>

707
01:24:42,350 --> 01:24:44,100
She looks like a Noa.

708
01:24:44,184 --> 01:24:47,725
So as it turns out,
Noa was the perfect name for her.

709
01:24:49,725 --> 01:24:50,725
Nico.

710
01:24:51,475 --> 01:24:52,475
<i>Yeah?</i>

711
01:24:53,350 --> 01:24:55,225
Nico, I love you more than yesterday.

712
01:24:56,517 --> 01:24:57,934
<i>But less than tomorrow.</i>

713
01:26:57,225 --> 01:26:58,767
DAY 18
DAY 15

714
01:26:58,850 --> 01:26:59,684
DAY 20

715
01:26:59,767 --> 01:27:01,225
DAY 23

716
01:27:01,309 --> 01:27:02,309
MAXIMUM

717
01:27:02,392 --> 01:27:04,475
DAY 26

718
01:27:15,767 --> 01:27:18,892
DAY 14
I'M SICK OF EATING FISH

719
01:27:18,975 --> 01:27:20,850
DAY 20
SHE'S BEEN SLEEPING ALL DAY

720
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:27,559
DAY 24
I CAN'T STOP THE WATER

721
01:27:27,642 --> 01:27:30,059
I HAVE TO LIVE UP TOP

722
01:28:13,892 --> 01:28:15,267
It's okay.
I gotcha.

723
01:28:26,517 --> 01:28:27,517
Hey!

724
01:28:29,017 --> 01:28:30,017
Noa!

725
01:28:30,517 --> 01:28:32,725
That was a seagull.

726
01:28:32,809 --> 01:28:34,434
You know what that means, honey?

727
01:28:48,684 --> 01:28:51,809
MAXIMUM

728
01:29:06,059 --> 01:29:07,059
Okay.

729
01:29:13,225 --> 01:29:14,392
Huh?

730
01:29:17,684 --> 01:29:18,725
No!

731
01:29:53,434 --> 01:29:54,434
No.

732
01:29:56,184 --> 01:29:57,600
You're fucking kidding.

733
01:30:29,684 --> 01:30:31,059
What's happening?

734
01:30:32,017 --> 01:30:33,017
No!

735
01:31:49,642 --> 01:31:50,809
Noa!

736
01:31:53,434 --> 01:31:54,767
Noa!

737
01:31:54,850 --> 01:31:55,892
Noa!

738
01:31:56,684 --> 01:31:57,809
Noa!

739
01:32:02,642 --> 01:32:03,684
Noa!

740
01:32:09,059 --> 01:32:10,642
No. Go away!

741
01:32:10,725 --> 01:32:12,309
Noa.
Noa!

742
01:32:14,225 --> 01:32:15,225
Noa!

743
01:32:17,142 --> 01:32:18,267
Noa!

744
01:32:40,809 --> 01:32:41,809
Noa!

745
01:32:41,892 --> 01:32:45,434
Noa! Noa! Noa!

746
01:32:46,350 --> 01:32:47,600
Noa!

747
01:33:04,350 --> 01:33:06,559
Noa, I'm coming!

748
01:33:06,642 --> 01:33:08,850
Noa!

749
01:33:13,184 --> 01:33:14,517
Noa!

750
01:33:41,184 --> 01:33:42,684
I'm here.
Don't worry.

751
01:33:42,767 --> 01:33:46,267
I'm here.
Noa. Noa.

752
01:33:57,475 --> 01:33:58,809
Everything's fine.

753
01:34:32,809 --> 01:34:33,809
Hm...

754
01:34:47,642 --> 01:34:48,642
We're almost there.

755
01:34:51,934 --> 01:34:54,309
We've almost made it.
Don't give up now.

756
01:34:54,392 --> 01:34:55,892
Just gotta keep going

757
01:34:56,475 --> 01:34:57,559
for a while longer.

758
01:34:58,434 --> 01:34:59,517
Gotta hold on.

759
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:02,142
We've gotta live to tell our story, Noa.

760
01:35:04,934 --> 01:35:06,975
Yeah, I know.
They'll think we're crazy.

761
01:35:07,850 --> 01:35:09,517
But we know it's true, don't we?

762
01:35:12,434 --> 01:35:13,934
We put up a good fight, honey.

763
01:35:17,725 --> 01:35:19,434
We did everything we could, didn't we?

764
01:35:24,350 --> 01:35:25,934
My love, you saved me.

765
01:35:28,100 --> 01:35:29,350
You saved my life.

766
01:35:34,100 --> 01:35:35,100
Forgive me.

767
01:35:35,809 --> 01:35:37,142
I was so scared.

768
01:35:38,934 --> 01:35:40,809
But you gave me strength.

769
01:35:44,642 --> 01:35:46,184
And I did everything I could...

770
01:35:49,517 --> 01:35:50,809
didn't I?

771
01:35:50,892 --> 01:35:52,309
I did everything I could.

772
01:35:55,975 --> 01:35:57,392
I couldn't have done more.

773
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:03,934
I did everything I could.

774
01:36:50,892 --> 01:36:52,993
- There's no fish, Dad!
- Wanna try this?

775
01:36:53,017 --> 01:36:55,100
Do you wanna say something?
No, no. I'm only joking.

776
01:36:55,184 --> 01:36:56,767
No, we only use the radio...

777
01:36:59,309 --> 01:37:01,975
I told you.
I think you have to move.

778
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:18,684
Do you see those seagulls?

779
01:37:18,767 --> 01:37:20,142
Can we go a little bit closer?

780
01:37:39,350 --> 01:37:40,600
What's that?

781
01:38:04,100 --> 01:38:05,559
Jesus Christ.

782
01:38:07,184 --> 01:38:08,184
Hey.

783
01:38:09,934 --> 01:38:10,975
Where's his family?

784
01:39:53,225 --> 01:39:54,392
Come on!

785
01:40:00,767 --> 01:40:02,559
You can do it! Harder!

786
01:40:06,850 --> 01:40:08,850
That's it.
That's it. Turn her over.

787
01:40:09,434 --> 01:40:11,142
It's okay.

788
01:40:12,142 --> 01:40:14,642
It's okay. It's okay.

789
01:40:14,725 --> 01:40:15,725
It's okay.

790
01:40:16,392 --> 01:40:18,184
It's okay.

791
01:40:22,350 --> 01:40:24,767
Get her over.

792
01:40:25,934 --> 01:40:28,854
- Come on. Sit her up against there.
- Gently. There you go.

793
01:40:29,809 --> 01:40:32,225
- Okay. Just get her over here.
- Hey.

794
01:40:34,309 --> 01:40:37,100
You're okay. You're okay.

795
01:40:40,309 --> 01:40:42,100
My daughter?
My daughter.

796
01:40:42,184 --> 01:40:44,059
- She's here, she's here.
- My daughter.

797
01:40:44,142 --> 01:40:46,142
Mayday, mayday.
We have an emergency here.

798
01:40:46,225 --> 01:40:48,142
We pulled a woman
and a child out of the water.

799
01:40:48,225 --> 01:40:49,309
The woman's okay.

800
01:40:49,392 --> 01:40:51,725
She has--
We've given her CPR and she's alive.

801
01:40:51,809 --> 01:40:53,600
She's okay.
She's not hurt.

802
01:40:58,100 --> 01:40:59,142
Hey.
She's okay.

803
01:41:01,934 --> 01:41:03,854
Yeah, yeah.
We're on our way back now.

804
01:41:04,392 --> 01:41:06,309
We should be back in port
in about 20 minutes.

805
01:41:09,725 --> 01:41:11,565
Your jacket's soaking wet.
Need to take it off.

806
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:13,225
No, no. Please don't.
I want it on.

807
01:41:13,309 --> 01:41:14,909
- Please. Please.
- It's okay. It's okay.

808
01:41:19,309 --> 01:41:20,725
Are you hurt?

809
01:41:22,934 --> 01:41:24,392
