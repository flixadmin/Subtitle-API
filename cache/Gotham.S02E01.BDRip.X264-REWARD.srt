1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,254
<i>Last season on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:03,421 --> 00:00:05,131
It's in here. It's in this room.

3
00:00:05,382 --> 00:00:07,050
My father's secret, it's in this room.

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,095
Going after Loeb is suicide.
Plain and simple.

5
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:12,305
As usual, wrong place, wrong time.

6
00:00:12,514 --> 00:00:13,723
You're a disgrace, Loeb.

7
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,934
What's black and white, and red all over?
Stop talking like that.

8
00:00:18,061 --> 00:00:19,437
Why did you kill your mother, Jerome?

9
00:00:22,232 --> 00:00:24,442
Barbara, Jason Lennon killed your parents.

10
00:00:24,651 --> 00:00:26,444
- You didn't kill them.
- Yes, I did.

11
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:29,781
Goodbye, Fish!

12
00:00:34,452 --> 00:00:36,830
I'm the King of Gotham!

13
00:00:37,163 --> 00:00:38,331
What is it, do you think?

14
00:00:58,476 --> 00:00:59,728
Bloody hell.

15
00:01:04,858 --> 00:01:06,359
No, wait, wait, wait!

16
00:01:25,044 --> 00:01:27,672
There must be a million possible
combinations, Master Bruce.

17
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,642
Drink it all.

18
00:03:02,851 --> 00:03:04,519
Thank you, master.

19
00:03:14,654 --> 00:03:15,947
Now go.

20
00:03:19,784 --> 00:03:22,328
Come on through. Let's go! Let's go.

21
00:03:29,586 --> 00:03:32,297
I am Zaardon,

22
00:03:33,339 --> 00:03:35,800
the Soul Reaper!

23
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:40,054
Foolish slaves! You cannot escape me!

24
00:03:40,263 --> 00:03:41,598
Sir, drop the guns!

25
00:03:48,396 --> 00:03:49,564
You! You!

26
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:56,321
Your primitive weapons cannot hurt me.

27
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:59,657
Prepare to die, insect.

28
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:05,079
Hey, listen.
I don't want to shoot you, man, all right?

29
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:08,291
Too much paperwork.
So why don't you just put the sword down?

30
00:04:22,013 --> 00:04:23,806
Stay down. Relax.

31
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,022
- Yo, Gordon, what's up? Busy shift?
- You're late.

32
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:34,067
Jeez, relax will you?
What's the matter with you, man?

33
00:04:38,905 --> 00:04:41,991
Hey! Bad idea.

34
00:04:47,413 --> 00:04:48,706
How can this be?

35
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:51,459
Zaardon drank dragon's blood
from the master's chalice.

36
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:55,421
- "Zaardon," that spelled how it sounds?
- Two A's.

37
00:04:55,713 --> 00:04:57,048
Close enough.

38
00:04:57,298 --> 00:05:01,511
- You dare send me to prison?
- Oh, no, you're a cinch for Arkham.

39
00:05:02,971 --> 00:05:04,430
Hear me, Gordon.

40
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:08,101
You might have won this battle,
but the war has just begun.

41
00:05:08,643 --> 00:05:11,437
The master will unleash
hell upon you.

42
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:16,401
Dark days are coming.

43
00:05:17,235 --> 00:05:18,861
Thanks for the heads-up.

44
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:29,330
Ed.

45
00:05:30,456 --> 00:05:33,001
- You okay?
- Never better.

46
00:05:33,793 --> 00:05:35,920
<i>Officer Gordon 2-3-6-1-1.</i>

47
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:38,589
<i>Report to
the captain's office immediately.</i>

48
00:05:40,508 --> 00:05:43,136
I'm up. See you.

49
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:50,518
He's gone. Relax.

50
00:05:51,853 --> 00:05:56,107
Holy moley, look at you.
Everyone's gonna think you're going nuts.

51
00:05:56,774 --> 00:05:59,610
I get nervous when you talk to me
with other people around like that.

52
00:06:00,778 --> 00:06:02,238
Stop doing that!

53
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:03,948
- What?
- That!

54
00:06:04,657 --> 00:06:05,783
Copying me.

55
00:06:05,992 --> 00:06:08,161
Dude. It's a mirror.
That's how they work.

56
00:06:10,413 --> 00:06:12,123
<i>You know what I think we need?</i>

57
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:17,795
I think that we need
a little more fun.

58
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:19,630
Some romance.

59
00:06:20,298 --> 00:06:22,800
Stop. I know where this is going.

60
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:26,804
I told you, leave Ms. Kringle alone.

61
00:06:27,055 --> 00:06:28,473
Imagine her in our arms.

62
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:35,396
Those big eyes looking up at us,
and soft, trembling flesh...

63
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:36,981
Be quiet!

64
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:46,365
It's a simple question, Officer Gordon.

65
00:06:46,616 --> 00:06:50,411
Did you or did you not
put your hands on Officer Franks, here?

66
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,206
Yes. I did.

67
00:06:56,834 --> 00:07:00,671
From the first day on the job,
you've been an insubordinate troublemaker.

68
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,342
I hoped demotion to uniform duty
would suffice to make you quit.

69
00:07:04,634 --> 00:07:06,844
It worked for your partner, Bullock.

70
00:07:07,345 --> 00:07:10,223
However, you've now
confessed to violation of section 12.

71
00:07:10,515 --> 00:07:12,391
Immediate dismissal is mandatory.

72
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:17,897
Commissioner, this is not just.

73
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:20,608
Officer Franks sustained no harm,

74
00:07:20,817 --> 00:07:23,027
and Officer Gordon
showed admirable restraint

75
00:07:23,236 --> 00:07:25,530
in defusing a dangerous hostage situation.

76
00:07:25,738 --> 00:07:28,658
Thank you so much for your input, Captain.
The facts speak for themselves.

77
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:32,870
The facts say he deserves
commendation, not dismissal.

78
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:34,705
You're letting gutter politics--

79
00:07:34,956 --> 00:07:38,084
That's enough, young lady.
Take Officer...

80
00:07:39,544 --> 00:07:42,463
Mr. Gordon's badge and gun.
That's an order.

81
00:07:50,012 --> 00:07:52,431
All good. Let it go.

82
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:55,852
Thanks, though.

83
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:01,023
It's been an honor working for you.

84
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,569
This is all for the best, you know.

85
00:08:05,653 --> 00:08:09,282
Some men are just not meant to be cops.

86
00:08:20,418 --> 00:08:22,044
I told you I'd break you.

87
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,840
I will.

88
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:57,914
What did you say to Loeb?
Did you get mad?

89
00:08:58,873 --> 00:09:01,292
Well, I disagreed with his decision.

90
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:05,129
Come on, you know I need the details.

91
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:09,008
I said I'd break him.
Words to that effect.

92
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:11,427
Hey. You went out with a bang.

93
00:09:13,763 --> 00:09:15,640
Maybe it's for the best.

94
00:09:18,142 --> 00:09:19,977
That's what Loeb said.

95
00:09:21,145 --> 00:09:24,607
Should've walked away.
I just hate to quit.

96
00:09:27,235 --> 00:09:30,196
You didn't quit, you were fired.
What can you do?

97
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:33,824
There's things I can do.

98
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:37,119
I thought you said
you didn't have any legal moves left.

99
00:09:37,328 --> 00:09:38,496
I don't.

100
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:46,128
You wanna be a cop so bad,
you're willing to break the law?

101
00:09:46,337 --> 00:09:48,756
Willing to bend it a little, yeah.

102
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:52,718
You're happy I got fired, huh?

103
00:09:54,053 --> 00:09:55,263
You got me.

104
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,393
But only because
I know that you'll never quit.

105
00:10:00,768 --> 00:10:02,812
And I love that about you.

106
00:10:03,771 --> 00:10:06,357
But they have you directing traffic, Jim.

107
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:08,609
Why keep beating your head
against the wall?

108
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:10,653
I'm a cop, Lee.

109
00:10:12,697 --> 00:10:14,282
I'm a cop.

110
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:25,960
Hi, gorgeous. I'm Jerome.

111
00:10:26,252 --> 00:10:27,545
Keep moving, ginger.

112
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:31,257
Just being polite.
So what you in for?

113
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:32,925
Killing my parents.

114
00:10:33,551 --> 00:10:34,552
Oh.

115
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:38,264
Me, too! Well, mom, anyhow.

116
00:10:39,098 --> 00:10:43,311
Liberating, right? Oh, what a rush!

117
00:10:44,395 --> 00:10:45,771
All righty then.

118
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:50,318
You see the big handsome fella
staring at you like you're fried chicken?

119
00:10:50,735 --> 00:10:54,572
Richard Sionis. He's a millionaire.
Got his own airplane.

120
00:10:54,822 --> 00:10:57,325
Got a boat with a hot tub on it.

121
00:10:57,658 --> 00:11:00,786
And he killed 25 people,
just for fun.

122
00:11:01,287 --> 00:11:02,580
So what?

123
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,749
So, he likes you.

124
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:09,003
- He wants to be your friend.
- Hmm. Let me think. No.

125
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,965
A girl needs a good friend in here.

126
00:11:14,467 --> 00:11:16,302
See, the guards, they don't care.

127
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,763
They figure bad things
happen to bad people.

128
00:11:19,013 --> 00:11:23,434
And they happen all the time.
All the time.

129
00:11:25,186 --> 00:11:27,772
Hey, you. Hello!

130
00:11:28,773 --> 00:11:30,816
Baldy! Here, here. Hello, yes.

131
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,943
Hi. Come here.

132
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:44,580
Hi.

133
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:46,749
Hi.

134
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:48,417
My name is Barbara.

135
00:11:50,044 --> 00:11:52,296
- Would you be my friend?
- Yes.

136
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:58,677
Hey. If someone here tries to hurt me,
would you protect me?

137
00:11:58,928 --> 00:12:00,012
Yes.

138
00:12:00,638 --> 00:12:02,306
Thank you so much.

139
00:12:02,807 --> 00:12:04,683
Cutie.

140
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,234
- Now I have a friend.
- You're bad.

141
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:16,028
Yeah, so why don't you
go make me a sandwich?

142
00:12:17,488 --> 00:12:21,283
Your friend is a gorilla.
My friend runs the joint.

143
00:12:21,492 --> 00:12:25,162
And he can get you things
that other people can't get you.

144
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:30,292
- Things like what?
- Anything you need.

145
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:33,003
I need a telephone.

146
00:12:37,842 --> 00:12:41,470
Odgen Barker, in for 70 grand
plus two months' vig,

147
00:12:41,971 --> 00:12:43,848
250 and change.

148
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,935
Says he owes Falcone,
Falcone's gone, so his debt's forfeit.

149
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:50,813
Well, we can't have him saying that.

150
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:54,567
What if everybody started saying that?
There'd be anarchy.

151
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:57,862
What is it?

152
00:12:58,863 --> 00:13:01,991
Oh, splendid.

153
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,578
Jim, come on in.

154
00:13:12,877 --> 00:13:14,670
My dear old friend.

155
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:16,630
We need to talk.

156
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:20,634
Oh. Leave us.

157
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:29,226
Hey, Selina.
Moving on up, huh?

158
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:30,728
Trying.

159
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:35,483
Isn't she darling?
It's like having a cat around the house.

160
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:38,319
But no horrid dead mice.

161
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:43,741
I need a favor.
I figure you owe me one.

162
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:46,202
I do?

163
00:13:47,453 --> 00:13:50,414
I'm always happy to help you, Jim,
but I don't recall--

164
00:13:50,623 --> 00:13:53,250
The hospital.
I saved you from Maroni's men.

165
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:55,794
But I was only there
because you arrested me.

166
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,671
For attempted murder.

167
00:13:58,714 --> 00:14:00,925
Remind me again why I let you go.

168
00:14:01,342 --> 00:14:03,093
Enlightened friendship.

169
00:14:03,761 --> 00:14:07,640
I'd call us even, but let's not quibble.

170
00:14:08,766 --> 00:14:11,352
I'm so happy you came to me for help, Jim.

171
00:14:12,353 --> 00:14:15,314
The answer is yes.
Your wish is granted.

172
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:17,149
You don't know what it is yet.

173
00:14:18,776 --> 00:14:21,946
You want Loeb fired
and your old job back. No?

174
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:25,115
Yes.

175
00:14:25,783 --> 00:14:29,119
For a good friend like you,
it can be done.

176
00:14:29,954 --> 00:14:31,997
If you're sure that's what you want.

177
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:33,958
I'm sure.

178
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,793
May I ask why?

179
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:39,380
Police work in Gotham
is such a thankless job.

180
00:14:39,755 --> 00:14:41,048
Good pension.

181
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,092
What does Lee think?

182
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:45,261
Who?

183
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:52,560
- Are you gonna help me or not?
- Relax. I already said I would help.

184
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:55,479
He is so brusque, isn't he?

185
00:14:56,814 --> 00:15:00,484
Thank you. Oh, while I think on it,

186
00:15:01,193 --> 00:15:04,530
perhaps there's a small favor
you could do for me in return.

187
00:15:04,989 --> 00:15:07,199
I know how you hate to owe favors.

188
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:15,666
I am having a small business dispute
with a friend of mine, Odgen Barker.

189
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:20,504
You have a persuasive personality.
Perhaps you can talk to him.

190
00:15:26,844 --> 00:15:28,596
You want me to collect a debt for you?

191
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:32,641
I want you to prove to me
that our friendship is a real one.

192
00:15:33,017 --> 00:15:35,102
Based on trust and equity.

193
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:37,521
That's fair.

194
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:44,903
No, sorry. Can't help you.
Congratulations on all your success.

195
00:15:45,571 --> 00:15:46,864
Be good, Selina.

196
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:48,324
Always.

197
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:52,202
Don't say no now, Jim. Sleep on it.

198
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:05,382
Screw Penguin,
screw the G.C.P.D., and screw this city.

199
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:08,177
Amen.
You're doing the right thing, brother.

200
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,262
Walk away, Jim, just walk away.

201
00:16:10,554 --> 00:16:12,264
You would do the same thing, right?

202
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:15,726
Me? I'd serve a sandwich to Beelzebub,
but that's just me.

203
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:18,604
You are a moralist.
You could never work for Penguin.

204
00:16:18,854 --> 00:16:20,856
The shame would eat away at your guts.

205
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:22,274
Yeah.

206
00:16:23,067 --> 00:16:24,193
Yeah.

207
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:27,571
- Whoa. Slow down, slurpy.
- Mmm.

208
00:16:28,364 --> 00:16:32,159
- You're not joining me?
- I've been sober 32 days.

209
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:33,911
Thirty-two days, huh?

210
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:37,498
It's no biggy. Once I quit the job,
quitting drinking was easy.

211
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:41,585
It's the job, Jim.
Makes us angry. Makes us hard.

212
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:42,961
Yeah, it does.

213
00:16:43,212 --> 00:16:45,214
<i>It's hard to walk away,
but it can be done.</i>

214
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:47,299
I just couldn't carry that badge anymore.

215
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,803
Look at me now. Hmm?
I'm sober.

216
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:56,392
I have a woman who does not dislike me.
I live in a house. I sleep at night.

217
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,560
I've never been happier in my life.

218
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:01,230
Here's to civilian life.

219
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:14,743
I'm proud of you, bro.

220
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:18,205
Gotta go.

221
00:17:27,965 --> 00:17:32,219
I really am most frightfully sorry it took
so long to answer the door, sir. Strange.

222
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,389
Normally, a buzzer sounds
when a car comes through the gates.

223
00:17:35,723 --> 00:17:36,932
<i>I walked.</i>

224
00:17:37,266 --> 00:17:39,184
You two are dirty.
What have you been doing?

225
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:41,562
I imagine you have
something important to say.

226
00:17:41,812 --> 00:17:42,980
Yes.

227
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:46,567
I've been fired from the G.C.P.D.

228
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:50,738
I won't be able to keep the promise
I made you. I wanted to apologize.

229
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:55,033
Your apology is accepted, of course.
But you didn't need to walk here.

230
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:57,327
A phone call would've been fine.

231
00:17:58,036 --> 00:17:59,204
I needed the air.

232
00:17:59,496 --> 00:18:02,291
- No hope for reinstatement then, sir?
- No.

233
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:08,005
Well, there is a way, but it's too ugly.

234
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:11,717
I would have to collect
a debt for Penguin.

235
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:13,802
To prove our friendship.

236
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:15,053
Ah.

237
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:20,559
But you can't do that,
because he's a bad man.

238
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:25,439
- And the task would be demeaning.
- Well, yes.

239
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:30,736
You were going
to find my parents' killers.

240
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:35,866
You were going to fight for justice.
You were going to clean up the G.C.P.D.

241
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:38,535
- Change Gotham.
- I had hoped to do that.

242
00:18:38,744 --> 00:18:41,872
If you remained at the G.C.P.D., you might
still be able to do all those good things.

243
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,750
But first, you must do something ugly.

244
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,544
And your personal honor forbids that.

245
00:18:47,878 --> 00:18:48,879
Yes.

246
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:53,300
Are you not sacrificing the greater good

247
00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:56,053
for the sake of your dignity
and self-esteem?

248
00:18:57,638 --> 00:19:00,516
- For vanity?
- Steady on, now, Master Bruce.

249
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:02,643
- Manners.
- He walked all the way here

250
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:05,562
to discuss the issue, Alfred.
I'm simply asking a question.

251
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:08,106
Surely, sometimes the right way

252
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:10,400
is also the ugly way.

253
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:13,362
Sometimes a man can't take the right way.

254
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:17,199
He is dealing with all kinds of business
you can't possibly understand yet

255
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:18,617
because you're still a child.

256
00:19:19,368 --> 00:19:22,579
Yes, Alfred, there is still
a great deal I don't understand yet.

257
00:19:23,956 --> 00:19:26,333
Please forgive me
if I've offended you, Jim.

258
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:29,920
No, no.

259
00:19:30,796 --> 00:19:32,256
That's okay.

260
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:34,758
I'll show you out, sir.

261
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:19,261
Screw it.

262
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:38,113
Jerome says you can get me a telephone.

263
00:20:38,322 --> 00:20:39,990
I try and help my friends.

264
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:42,117
What do your friends do for you?

265
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:48,999
Well, that depends on how much you want

266
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,168
a telephone.

267
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:12,856
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold it right there.

268
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,650
Odgen Barker.

269
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:17,361
Penguin asked me to talk to you.

270
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:21,615
Damn, boy!
You had me worried there for a minute.

271
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:27,120
I know you. You're Jim Gordon. Cop.
Supposed to be a cold stone hard-ass.

272
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:31,708
But you're Penguin's bitch, huh?
Who the dickens can you trust anymore?

273
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:33,293
He wants his money.

274
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:35,879
How many times
do I got to tell you people? No.

275
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:39,675
To Don Falcone, I'll pay.
To that fruitcake leprechaun?

276
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:41,843
Nish. Not a penny.

277
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:46,223
Falcone's retired. Times change.
Penguin's boss now.

278
00:21:46,682 --> 00:21:50,686
- Like hell. The freak won't last the year.
- Don't underestimate him.

279
00:21:50,978 --> 00:21:52,187
Advice, now.

280
00:21:52,396 --> 00:21:54,106
I'm trying to be nice here.
Let's work this out.

281
00:21:54,356 --> 00:21:56,400
Yeah? Let's not.

282
00:21:57,567 --> 00:21:58,694
Walk away.

283
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:02,698
Walk away.

284
00:22:02,906 --> 00:22:05,367
Before I kick your ass,
you crooked punk bitch.

285
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:09,579
How much money you got there?
Looks like a lot.

286
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,123
- What is your problem?
- I don't have a problem.

287
00:22:11,415 --> 00:22:12,582
Give me the money you owe.

288
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:14,918
How about I put a hole in your face?

289
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:20,674
- I'm gonna count to three.
- You're crazy.

290
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:22,217
One...

291
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:31,601
Put the money in the bag.
Do it!

292
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,821
Oh, get him, man.

293
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,876
Stop! Thief!

294
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:04,593
Out of the way!

295
00:23:22,486 --> 00:23:23,528
Hey, cop.

296
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:51,807
Fertilizer?
What is your game?

297
00:23:52,974 --> 00:23:56,144
I would have thought that's obvious
to a man of your perception.

298
00:24:00,357 --> 00:24:02,818
It occurred to me
to follow my own advice.

299
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:05,153
Sometimes the ugly way
is also the right way.

300
00:24:05,362 --> 00:24:06,822
I mean, a bomb, inside the house?

301
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,532
I mean, you're a having a laugh, ain't ya?
A bomb?

302
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,576
I was going to tell you.
I wanted to present it as a fait accompli.

303
00:24:11,868 --> 00:24:14,246
Don't start talking French to me.

304
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:17,082
You don't know the first thing
about bomb-making anyway, do you?

305
00:24:17,374 --> 00:24:19,126
I read a book, Alfred.
It seems simple enough.

306
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:20,544
A book.

307
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:24,631
I mean, you're gonna blow your bloody head
off before you put a dent in that thing.

308
00:24:25,423 --> 00:24:28,218
You know, maybe that door is trying
to tell us something.

309
00:24:28,844 --> 00:24:31,763
Maybe you're not ready
to find out what's behind it.

310
00:24:32,139 --> 00:24:34,141
Maybe we should wait until you're older.

311
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:37,853
I mean, who knows what your dear old Dad
was up to down there, anyway?

312
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:45,068
Like what?

313
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:50,073
Like things I wouldn't want to describe
to a child, which is exactly what you are.

314
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:55,662
I'm building a bomb
to blow down that door.

315
00:24:57,122 --> 00:24:58,540
You may assist me...

316
00:24:59,207 --> 00:25:02,836
Or not, as you wish.
But if not, some tea would be nice.

317
00:25:04,045 --> 00:25:08,049
Right, well, you're gonna need 10 more
sacks of that gear for starters,

318
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:12,512
three more jerricans, two lengths
of timber, and a heavy tarpaulin.

319
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:16,349
And I'll put the kettle on.

320
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,864
Excellent. Excellent.

321
00:25:31,656 --> 00:25:33,366
I'm so sorry things got messy.

322
00:25:34,284 --> 00:25:35,827
What a foolish fellow.

323
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:40,790
Never mind. I will make sure that there's
no follow-up from your colleagues.

324
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:42,334
Don't worry about a thing.

325
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:45,754
You knew. You knew Odgen would go off.

326
00:25:46,463 --> 00:25:48,798
What a devious mind you have.
I had no idea.

327
00:25:49,007 --> 00:25:50,175
We have a deal.

328
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:53,386
We do. We do.

329
00:26:05,732 --> 00:26:07,150
You okay, Jim?

330
00:26:08,526 --> 00:26:11,029
Oh, yeah. Daydreaming.

331
00:26:12,197 --> 00:26:14,991
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

332
00:26:20,872 --> 00:26:22,457
- Hello.
<i>- Hello.</i>

333
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:24,042
<i>Jim?</i>

334
00:26:27,003 --> 00:26:29,547
<i>- Hello, are you still there?</i>
- I'm here.

335
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:32,342
<i>Hi! How are you?</i>

336
00:26:32,676 --> 00:26:34,052
How did you get to a phone?

337
00:26:34,386 --> 00:26:38,473
Who cares? We're talking at last.
That's the important thing.

338
00:26:39,015 --> 00:26:40,058
What do you want?

339
00:26:40,308 --> 00:26:42,894
Jim, there's been a terrible mistake.

340
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:47,065
I never told Lee...

341
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:49,401
That I killed my Mom and Dad.

342
00:26:50,193 --> 00:26:52,028
<i>And I never attacked her.</i>

343
00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:54,197
She attacked me, Jim!

344
00:26:54,823 --> 00:26:56,199
She's completely insane!

345
00:26:56,449 --> 00:26:58,868
That's enough. Don't call again.

346
00:26:59,494 --> 00:27:00,620
Who was that?

347
00:27:03,957 --> 00:27:06,668
Sales call.
They can drive you crazy, huh?

348
00:27:06,835 --> 00:27:07,877
Sales call?

349
00:27:14,676 --> 00:27:15,719
Don't!

350
00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:17,846
- What?
- Don't answer it.

351
00:27:18,054 --> 00:27:19,681
- Jim, you're scaring me.
- It's Barbara.

352
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:21,141
<i>Go ahead and leave a message.</i>

353
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:28,106
<i>Hey, girlfriend. Guess who?
Sorry I missed you. Bummer, hey?</i>

354
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:30,734
I just wanted to say...

355
00:27:30,984 --> 00:27:33,445
That I hope you die screaming, bitch.

356
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:36,072
<i>Bye!</i>

357
00:27:38,742 --> 00:27:41,453
- Nice.
- All right, look.

358
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,080
She's safely locked up at Arkham.
She can't hurt you.

359
00:27:44,289 --> 00:27:47,500
I know. I know. She's just a sick person,
spreading sadness.

360
00:27:50,045 --> 00:27:53,715
Screw her. Let's be happy.
Let's go away some place.

361
00:27:54,049 --> 00:27:56,092
We can't let a crazy woman drive us out.

362
00:27:56,343 --> 00:27:59,596
Why not? Pride? Who cares?

363
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:03,433
We could go away and never come back.
What's keeping us here?

364
00:28:05,977 --> 00:28:08,813
- I can't leave.
- Why not?

365
00:28:10,023 --> 00:28:12,984
- Jim.
- I did a bad thing.

366
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:19,783
I did a bad thing.

367
00:28:51,523 --> 00:28:52,607
Hi.

368
00:28:57,737 --> 00:28:59,447
Do you have any peanut butter?

369
00:29:00,949 --> 00:29:02,283
What?

370
00:29:07,705 --> 00:29:10,708
Peanut butter? Smooth, for preference.

371
00:29:11,334 --> 00:29:13,878
Guards! Help! Help!

372
00:29:19,509 --> 00:29:20,802
Oh. Hi, boss.

373
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,347
How about a bottle of beer?

374
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:45,076
Let me share a dilemma with you.
May I?

375
00:29:48,621 --> 00:29:52,709
I need you to do something for me
that I know you won't want to do.

376
00:29:53,251 --> 00:29:54,335
What is it?

377
00:29:54,794 --> 00:29:56,880
With most people, there's no problem.

378
00:29:57,922 --> 00:30:02,844
I find their weak spots and use violence
or blackmail to persuade them.

379
00:30:04,095 --> 00:30:05,138
But you...

380
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:09,476
You are a man of monkish virtue.

381
00:30:10,268 --> 00:30:12,145
You have no vices to expose.

382
00:30:12,604 --> 00:30:16,065
So, threats of personal violence
will only harden your resolve, huh?

383
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:20,570
- No, that--
- Come, sir, don't be modest.

384
00:30:21,738 --> 00:30:24,491
You are a rare animal.

385
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:29,037
But that does lead us to this sad pickle.

386
00:30:30,163 --> 00:30:32,999
Since I can't persuade you to do as I ask,

387
00:30:33,374 --> 00:30:36,419
the only rational option is to kill you,

388
00:30:37,212 --> 00:30:40,590
and negotiate with whomever
replaces you as Commissioner.

389
00:30:40,924 --> 00:30:42,091
Now, chief?

390
00:30:43,051 --> 00:30:44,594
One moment, Victor.

391
00:30:45,094 --> 00:30:47,555
The Commissioner deserves time
to process all this.

392
00:30:48,932 --> 00:30:50,600
Say a prayer or what have you.

393
00:30:50,808 --> 00:30:52,310
What do you want me to do?

394
00:30:53,228 --> 00:30:55,271
It's not worth talking about.

395
00:30:55,772 --> 00:30:58,024
- You wouldn't do it.
- Tell me.

396
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:04,614
I need my friend Jim Gordon
reinstated as a detective.

397
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:08,743
See? You hate that idea.

398
00:31:08,993 --> 00:31:10,954
No, I'll... I'll do it.

399
00:31:11,162 --> 00:31:13,831
Mmm-mmm.
I can tell that you're not sincere.

400
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:16,626
Even if you do as I ask,

401
00:31:16,918 --> 00:31:21,464
someday down the line, you'll change
your mind and you'll turn on him again.

402
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:25,301
You want me to kill him now?

403
00:31:25,468 --> 00:31:28,638
No, make him a nice cheese toastie.
Yes, kill him now, please.

404
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:30,014
Just wanted to be clear.

405
00:31:30,306 --> 00:31:32,642
No, wait! Let's talk about this!

406
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:35,019
Sorry. Least worst option.

407
00:31:36,938 --> 00:31:38,690
Unless, of course--

408
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,276
No. You would never agree.

409
00:31:41,484 --> 00:31:43,194
To what? Agree to what?

410
00:32:08,595 --> 00:32:10,346
Lovely, lovely. Bravo.

411
00:32:11,347 --> 00:32:14,017
Mayor James regrets
he's unable to attend today,

412
00:32:14,434 --> 00:32:16,728
but he's sent a dear friend in his stead.

413
00:32:17,145 --> 00:32:18,354
Please welcome,

414
00:32:18,605 --> 00:32:21,691
distinguished businessman,
visionary scientist,

415
00:32:21,983 --> 00:32:25,778
acclaimed philanthropist,
and new Chairman of Development

416
00:32:26,195 --> 00:32:28,281
at the Gotham Chamber of Commerce,

417
00:32:28,781 --> 00:32:30,450
Mr. Theo Galavan.

418
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,541
Thank you so much. Uh...

419
00:32:39,042 --> 00:32:44,130
What an honor it is to be here today,
to help bid farewell to a great man,

420
00:32:44,589 --> 00:32:46,924
and a faithful servant of this city.

421
00:32:47,342 --> 00:32:51,262
What can I say about Gillian Loeb?

422
00:32:53,556 --> 00:32:56,643
Someone tell me a funny story.

423
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,770
I have a good one.

424
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:01,022
So, when I was in college,

425
00:33:01,397 --> 00:33:05,401
I played for the varsity polo team.
And I had a string of ponies...

426
00:33:05,818 --> 00:33:07,195
Greetings!

427
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:11,240
I am Zaardon the Soul Reaper.

428
00:33:12,742 --> 00:33:14,369
So, I had these ponies...

429
00:33:14,702 --> 00:33:17,121
I'm an adopted son of this city.

430
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:21,918
I haven't lived in Gotham very long,
but I already love her like a native.

431
00:33:23,294 --> 00:33:28,049
It just kind of grabs hold of you,
doesn't it?

432
00:33:30,968 --> 00:33:34,097
There's magic here. Magic.

433
00:33:35,264 --> 00:33:39,060
And that is down
to everyday heroes like Gillian Loeb.

434
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:43,439
Mister Commissioner,
thank you for your service.

435
00:33:54,951 --> 00:33:57,286
Thank you very much, everybody.

436
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,207
My best wishes to...

437
00:34:06,003 --> 00:34:07,505
Commissioner Essen.

438
00:34:15,555 --> 00:34:18,808
And the maître d' says,
"You can't bring them in here..."

439
00:34:19,016 --> 00:34:20,226
Hear me, slaves.

440
00:34:20,643 --> 00:34:24,564
My patience is wearing thin.
Surrender your souls to my mercy,

441
00:34:24,856 --> 00:34:27,233
or I swear by the Master,

442
00:34:27,859 --> 00:34:32,488
I shall feast on your pain!
I shall gorge on your torment!

443
00:34:33,156 --> 00:34:35,533
I shall crush you like a bug.

444
00:35:03,686 --> 00:35:06,022
Backup Area Five. Area Five!

445
00:35:20,912 --> 00:35:22,538
Welcome back, Jim.

446
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:26,959
I don't know how you pulled this off,
but I'm glad you did.

447
00:35:27,627 --> 00:35:29,337
He's a resourceful man.

448
00:35:30,129 --> 00:35:32,590
- Congratulations, to both of you.
- Thank you.

449
00:35:32,924 --> 00:35:36,385
And it is a new day, Jim.
We're going to do great things.

450
00:35:36,636 --> 00:35:37,887
Yes, we are.

451
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,230
It is a new day.

452
00:35:48,481 --> 00:35:50,149
Things are gonna be all right. I promise.

453
00:35:51,234 --> 00:35:53,861
- I hope it was worth it.
- I hope so, too.

454
00:35:54,821 --> 00:35:55,905
Jim.

455
00:35:57,406 --> 00:35:58,574
What's wrong?

456
00:35:58,866 --> 00:36:03,037
There's been an incident at Arkham Asylum.
Six inmates have escaped.

457
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:06,249
- Barbara Kean was one of them.
- Oh, my God.

458
00:36:17,051 --> 00:36:20,221
- What the hell is this place?
- It ain't Arkham, anyhow.

459
00:36:21,305 --> 00:36:22,765
Things are looking up.

460
00:36:23,933 --> 00:36:25,434
Welcome, everyone.

461
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,857
My name is Theo Galavan.
This is my sister, Tabitha.

462
00:36:34,777 --> 00:36:37,947
I understand you're feeling confused...

463
00:36:39,198 --> 00:36:42,702
Scared, a little groggy,
but please, relax.

464
00:36:42,952 --> 00:36:46,956
Today is the first day
of a wonderful future for all of you.

465
00:36:47,874 --> 00:36:50,001
- If you want it.
- Who are you?

466
00:36:51,002 --> 00:36:53,838
Well, now, the question is, who are you?

467
00:36:55,381 --> 00:36:58,467
The world sees criminal lunatics.

468
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:01,137
I see brilliance.

469
00:37:02,847 --> 00:37:04,473
I see charisma.

470
00:37:07,435 --> 00:37:08,728
And power.

471
00:37:10,813 --> 00:37:12,231
I see power.

472
00:37:13,482 --> 00:37:16,652
Yes! Exactly, my man.

473
00:37:16,903 --> 00:37:18,905
That is so spooky. That is me to a T.

474
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,034
These other bozos, I don't know,
but you're singing my song.

475
00:37:23,284 --> 00:37:24,869
Quiet, Jerome.

476
00:37:25,745 --> 00:37:26,871
Keep talking.

477
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:34,837
Imagine a group
of brilliant outlaws like yourselves,

478
00:37:35,212 --> 00:37:37,924
each selected for a unique ability,

479
00:37:38,174 --> 00:37:41,844
all working together as a team.
Imagine the synergy.

480
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,513
Imagine the impact.

481
00:37:45,139 --> 00:37:47,391
Gotham would tremble before you.

482
00:37:48,601 --> 00:37:53,564
Well, that sounds fabulous,
but I'm not a brilliant outlaw.

483
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,608
I just have...

484
00:37:56,734 --> 00:37:59,028
Hmm... Issues.

485
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:05,159
You have ferocity and beauty and desire.
And that's enough.

486
00:38:06,661 --> 00:38:08,412
Come with me, Barbara.

487
00:38:09,872 --> 00:38:12,917
Whatever you want in the world,
it's yours.

488
00:38:14,418 --> 00:38:17,922
Theo? That's your name, right? Theo.

489
00:38:18,339 --> 00:38:20,591
You're getting way
ahead of yourself, here.

490
00:38:20,841 --> 00:38:26,472
First of all, keep your hands off her.
Second, this whole "magic team"?

491
00:38:27,181 --> 00:38:29,976
I gotta pass. I don't take orders.

492
00:38:30,726 --> 00:38:34,063
Good luck on everything, though.
It's an intriguing concept.

493
00:38:36,983 --> 00:38:38,734
This is very disappointing.

494
00:38:39,235 --> 00:38:40,236
Oh.

495
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:47,076
Fair play. You want a reward for
busting us out of Arkham. I'm grateful.

496
00:38:48,411 --> 00:38:50,997
How's a million bucks sound? Pretty good?

497
00:38:51,247 --> 00:38:52,832
I can get it for you today...

498
00:38:53,749 --> 00:38:55,876
As soon as I hit the street.

499
00:38:56,252 --> 00:39:00,840
Money's not the concern.
I had such high hopes for you.

500
00:39:02,508 --> 00:39:05,970
I didn't anticipate sexual jealousy.
That always poisons the well.

501
00:39:06,721 --> 00:39:09,682
You have to go.
Tabitha will see you out.

502
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:16,397
Miss Kean is coming with me.

503
00:39:16,939 --> 00:39:19,316
Oh, She doesn't want
to go where you're going.

504
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,958
Anyone else wanna leave?

505
00:40:04,904 --> 00:40:09,533
There. You're absolutely sure about this,
Master Bruce? I strongly advise--

506
00:40:09,742 --> 00:40:12,161
Alfred, I need to know.

507
00:40:14,538 --> 00:40:16,082
Let's do this.

508
00:40:17,666 --> 00:40:19,001
Right, sir.

509
00:40:32,723 --> 00:40:34,266
Yes!

510
00:40:34,475 --> 00:40:35,768
Great! Yes!

511
00:41:32,074 --> 00:41:33,242
"Dear Bruce...

512
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:36,787
"These last weeks I begin
to feel very mortal,

513
00:41:38,372 --> 00:41:42,001
"which prompts this note to you.
Perhaps I'm being paranoid.

514
00:41:42,459 --> 00:41:46,463
"I hope so. In any case,
if you're reading this, then I'm dead,

515
00:41:47,256 --> 00:41:50,092
"and you figured out
that the entry code is... Bruce.

516
00:41:52,595 --> 00:41:55,514
"I'm sorry I had to hide this part
of my life from you.

517
00:41:55,764 --> 00:41:58,100
"Because this place only exists
because of you.

518
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:01,103
"Becoming a father made me want
to be a better man,

519
00:42:01,353 --> 00:42:04,315
"and I started asking hard questions
about the family business.

520
00:42:04,565 --> 00:42:05,858
"So here we are.

521
00:42:06,442 --> 00:42:10,362
"As I write this, you're 12,
and a fine, good-hearted boy,

522
00:42:11,906 --> 00:42:14,658
"so I'm sure you'll be a fine,
good-hearted man.

523
00:42:15,451 --> 00:42:17,119
"But that's all I know.

524
00:42:17,953 --> 00:42:20,414
"I don't know what happened
to me or your mother,

525
00:42:21,457 --> 00:42:23,250
"or how life has turned out for you.

526
00:42:23,667 --> 00:42:25,961
"I don't even know how old you are.

527
00:42:27,379 --> 00:42:30,674
"So I'll resist giving
you much fatherly advice.

528
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:37,223
"Only this. You can't have both
happiness and the truth.

529
00:42:39,975 --> 00:42:41,101
<i>"You have to choose.</i>

530
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:52,947
"I beg of you my son,
please, choose happiness.

531
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:56,659
"Unless you feel a calling.

532
00:43:02,665 --> 00:43:04,333
"A true calling."

533
00:44:03,183 --> 00:44:04,184
