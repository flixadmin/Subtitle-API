1
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:09,808
Huh?

2
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:13,479
Oni!

3
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:17,816
This antique
looks valuable.

4
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:19,785
Today is my lucky day.

5
00:00:19,787 --> 00:00:21,020
Not!

6
00:00:21,022 --> 00:00:24,957
No!

7
00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:26,992
Demon magic,
here I come.

8
00:00:26,994 --> 00:00:28,494
Finn: Not!

9
00:00:28,496 --> 00:00:31,063
You clowns had your shot
at being ninja masters

10
00:00:31,065 --> 00:00:32,998
and you blew it.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,768
We was doin' ok
till chan showed up.

12
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:38,337
Well, it's
Finn's turn, baby.

13
00:00:38,339 --> 00:00:41,140
Those shadowkhan
are gonna be my slaves,

14
00:00:41,142 --> 00:00:44,943
'cause nobody's taking
this mask from <i> me.</i>

15
00:00:44,945 --> 00:00:46,078
Not!

16
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:48,814
Told ya.

17
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:53,252
Ohh...

18
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:56,355
I hate fish.

19
00:00:56,357 --> 00:00:57,923
Jackie: Tohru!

20
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,527
Go, go, go!

21
00:01:01,529 --> 00:01:02,928
Finn, chow,
and ratso: Not!

22
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,296
Heh heh heh.

23
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:06,298
Look what
washed up on deck.

24
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,867
Jade! What are
you doing here?

25
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:11,770
Heh. It looks like
I'm catch of the day.

26
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:14,440
Give me back
my mask, chan...

27
00:01:14,442 --> 00:01:18,577
Or it's anchors aweigh
for your niece.

28
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:13,699
So, what's it
gonna be, chan...

29
00:02:13,701 --> 00:02:16,969
The kid or the mask?

30
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:18,604
Unh!

31
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:20,105
All: Aah!

32
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:21,607
(Panting)

33
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:24,243
Come here, you!

34
00:02:24,245 --> 00:02:26,044
Hunh! Hah!

35
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:27,212
Hyah!

36
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:35,087
Unh! Unh!

37
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:37,523
Here!

38
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:50,402
Yee-ha!

39
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:51,870
Unh!

40
00:02:51,872 --> 00:02:53,438
Huh?

41
00:02:58,311 --> 00:02:59,578
I...

42
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,712
Hate...

43
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:01,880
Fish.

44
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,583
Tohru, gun it!

45
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:13,091
Ahoy, maties!

46
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:17,229
Oh, man.

47
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:19,264
Tarakudo's gonna
have our heads.

48
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:21,066
That could be arranged.

49
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:23,502
(All gasp)

50
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:25,871
Jade: Uncle, we're back!

51
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:27,306
Jackie: And this time,

52
00:03:27,308 --> 00:03:29,675
the mask did not wind up
on anyone's face.

53
00:03:29,677 --> 00:03:31,843
We rule!

54
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:33,111
Ohh...

55
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:36,848
I will "rule"
after a nice hot bath.

56
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,317
Ow!

57
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,352
No time for rest, tohru.

58
00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:44,523
Uncle has located
Japanese encyclopedia of evil.

59
00:03:44,525 --> 00:03:47,292
You must research way
to defeat tarakudo

60
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:50,162
and put end
to oni mask quest.

61
00:03:50,164 --> 00:03:51,630
Yes, sensei.

62
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:54,433
One more thing:

63
00:03:54,435 --> 00:03:56,101
Do not forget to sweep.

64
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:57,302
Tohru: Yes, sensei.

65
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:58,604
One more thing:

66
00:03:58,606 --> 00:03:59,938
Sink is clogged.

67
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,340
Please plunge!

68
00:04:01,342 --> 00:04:02,975
Yes, sensei.

69
00:04:02,977 --> 00:04:04,409
One <i> more</i> thing...

70
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,078
Pee-ewh!

71
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,546
Rotten fish!

72
00:04:07,548 --> 00:04:09,815
Take a bath!

73
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:11,316
One more thing...

74
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:13,285
No more things!

75
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:15,187
(Gasps)

76
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:19,024
You disrespect uncle?

77
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:20,592
Uncle took you in,

78
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:21,960
put roof over your head,

79
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:23,462
put food in your belly--

80
00:04:23,464 --> 00:04:25,530
<i>lots</i> of food--

81
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:27,966
and this is how
you repay me?!

82
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:29,835
I cook, I clean,

83
00:04:29,837 --> 00:04:32,771
I travel the world
to be smothered in fish,

84
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:36,275
and you thank me
by demanding
many more things?

85
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:39,311
Both: I will never
speak to you again!

86
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:40,379
Oh!

87
00:04:40,381 --> 00:04:41,980
Come on now!

88
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:44,182
You two are like family.

89
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:46,485
You have so much
to talk about.

90
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:47,719
Jade: Tch.

91
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:48,920
Like how come our new buddy

92
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:51,657
has a full-page ad
in <i> demons illustrated?</i>

93
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:55,794
"...and he was known
as ikazuki,

94
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:58,497
the most fearsome
of the oni generals."

95
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,265
(Slurping)

96
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:01,400
Jackie!

97
00:05:01,402 --> 00:05:03,068
Please tell tohru
to refrain

98
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,837
from making
slurping sounds.

99
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,939
Uh, uncle said--

100
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:09,808
Jade, please tell sensei

101
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,277
that I will eat my dinner
however I please.

102
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,412
Uh--

103
00:05:13,414 --> 00:05:14,613
please ask tohru

104
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:18,684
if he would like piece
of uncle for dessert!

105
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:19,951
Jade: Uh...

106
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:21,787
Uncle says
you're doing great.

107
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:23,322
Keep reading.

108
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,426
Tohru: "A natural leader,

109
00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:29,361
"ikazuki
was second in command

110
00:05:29,363 --> 00:05:31,330
"to the lord of all oni,

111
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:34,099
tarakudo, king
of the shadowkhan."

112
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:35,334
And?

113
00:05:35,336 --> 00:05:36,768
The chapter ends.

114
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,070
Well, betcha
he could tell us

115
00:05:38,072 --> 00:05:40,305
how to take down tarakudo
once and for all.

116
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:42,741
Perhaps, but I do not
think it is possible

117
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:44,910
to interrogate
a mask, Jade.

118
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:47,312
Oh?

119
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:50,082
If you wanna talk
to an inanimate mask...

120
00:05:50,084 --> 00:05:54,686
Try the talisman
that brings motion
to the motionless.

121
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,988
Are we sure dabbling
with dark forces

122
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,690
is the best idea?

123
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:06,932
Ikazuki lives!

124
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:11,603
Bow before
my mighty form and--

125
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:13,638
where <i> is</i> my mighty form?

126
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,541
Insolent humans.

127
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,810
You shall pay
for your trickery

128
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:21,113
at the hands
of my shadowkhan!

129
00:06:21,115 --> 00:06:22,414
(Growls)

130
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:27,119
Ahem.

131
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:29,388
At the hands
of my shadowkhan!

132
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:35,861
The masks may only
summon shadowkhan

133
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:37,095
if they are whole,

134
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:39,297
attached
to a human host.

135
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:41,600
Jade, please
tell tohru

136
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:43,935
not to state obvious.

137
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:45,637
Uncle says "duh."

138
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:47,939
Ok, Jackie...

139
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:49,674
Good cop, bad cop.

140
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:54,980
Uh, hello,
Mr. ikazuki-San.

141
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:56,481
We were wondering

142
00:06:56,483 --> 00:07:00,018
if maybe you might
tell us how to defeat
tarakudo?

143
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,820
I shall devour your brains!

144
00:07:01,822 --> 00:07:03,255
Aah!

145
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:05,857
All right, you half-baked
arts and crafts project,

146
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:08,293
start talking or I'll
redecorate your mug

147
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:09,861
with macaroni
and puffy paint!

148
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:12,264
Please,
we just need to know--

149
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:13,365
I have a glue gun

150
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:14,900
and I'm not afraid
to use it.

151
00:07:14,902 --> 00:07:16,668
Your threats do not
interest me,

152
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,904
but he does.

153
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:20,639
M-me?

154
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:24,543
With my magnificent face
atop your mighty form,

155
00:07:24,545 --> 00:07:27,012
we would be unstoppable.

156
00:07:27,014 --> 00:07:30,048
Uh, no, but I--I
do not want, uh...

157
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:34,486
Jade, please tell tohru
to stop quivering like
frightened chihuahua!

158
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:36,555
Please tell the
scowling Billy goat

159
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:38,156
that I am not
frightened.

160
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:41,660
Uh, easy there, boys.

161
00:07:41,662 --> 00:07:44,563
Please tell tohru
that uncle will give him

162
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:46,331
something to be
frightened about!

163
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:49,568
Please tell sensei
that I would like
to see him try!

164
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,904
Stop! We should not be
arguing with each other.

165
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:55,307
We should be questioning
the mask.

166
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:56,875
Um, what mask?

167
00:07:58,444 --> 00:07:59,744
Aiyaa!

168
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:01,246
It is gone!

169
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:03,215
How?! It is a mask!

170
00:08:03,217 --> 00:08:05,817
It did not just get up
and walk away.

171
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:09,354
Did it?

172
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,828
Ollie, Ollie, oxen free?!

173
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:24,402
If ikazuki gets loose,

174
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:27,405
he could wind up
on someone's face.

175
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:30,008
And be able to summon
his shadowkhan.

176
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,522
Finn: Jelly!

177
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:45,957
Mmm. You gonna eat that?

178
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:48,126
Hey, dunk
in our own coffee.

179
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,730
Boo.

180
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:53,298
Pbbt!

181
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,599
Whoa!

182
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:56,568
A cup of talkin' Joe.

183
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:01,072
I sense that that mask
is again within our reach.

184
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,222
Place me upon your face...

185
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:18,857
Now!

186
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:20,158
Aah!
- Aah!

187
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:22,761
Ai! Uhh! Oy!

188
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:27,198
Any sign of masky?

189
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:30,168
Nada.
- Uh-uh.

190
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,772
Well, our psychic leader
says it's around here
somewhere.

191
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:41,146
That's it. I'm tired
of hoofin' it.

192
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:45,684
Let's motor--whoa--ooh!

193
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:51,323
Ikazuki lives!

194
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:54,359
Bow before my mighty form!

195
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:56,595
Uhh! This is not
happening.

196
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:59,531
This is not
happening!

197
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:02,033
No way I'm bowin'
to Finn's tuccus.

198
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:07,939
Jade: So we just go back
to uncle's and use
the Hana fuda cards

199
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,174
to find the mask again.

200
00:10:09,176 --> 00:10:10,408
No biggie, right?

201
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,810
Yes, biggie!

202
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:15,013
Hana fuda cards work
only once per mask.

203
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:18,683
After mask is found,
cards are wiped
clean!

204
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:22,120
Jade, please tell sensei
that we should conjure
a locator spell.

205
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:25,690
Jackie, please tell
tohru that proper
locator spell

206
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:28,460
will take too long
to make,

207
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:30,762
not that
I could hear him.

208
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:32,664
Ooh, please!

209
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:36,234
I am tired of listening
to you two not talk.

210
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:38,803
The mask escaped because
you two were fighting,

211
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:42,407
and if you keep fighting,
it will wind up on an
innocent face

212
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:44,175
before we can find it.

213
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:45,410
Aiyaa!

214
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:51,850
Tell ex-apprentice
he did not give uncle
mask removal potion!

215
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:54,452
Please tell sensei
that his ex-apprentice

216
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:55,754
has it covered.

217
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:04,996
Remove your hands
from my face!

218
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:09,034
Remove your face
from my cheeks!

219
00:11:09,036 --> 00:11:12,137
Uh, Finn, I don't think
he's letting go.

220
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:18,043
Yeah, once the mask
is on, only good magic'll
pull it off, remember?

221
00:11:18,045 --> 00:11:20,979
You need one of them
<i>removal</i> potions.

222
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:22,580
In that case...

223
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:28,420
Whoa!

224
00:11:28,422 --> 00:11:31,289
I will have to make do
for the time being.

225
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:37,562
(Sobs)
Whoa.

226
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:41,900
Lizard says mask
is this way.

227
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:46,671
Blowfish says
the mask is that way.

228
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:49,174
Please tell tohru
uncle's lizard

229
00:11:49,176 --> 00:11:52,343
has seniority
over his blowfish.

230
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:53,945
Ohh, I give up.

231
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:57,749
Please tell sensei...

232
00:11:57,751 --> 00:11:59,250
Ohh...

233
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:01,052
I have the willies.

234
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:04,522
And I'm guessing
they're why.

235
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:10,095
General ikazuki,

236
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:11,863
how good to see you.

237
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:15,633
You're looking rather...
Heinous.

238
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:17,869
Oh, help me out,
tarakudo-mundo.

239
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:20,438
Your guy's really
giving me a wedgie!

240
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,373
Pipe down, wart!

241
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,943
Indeed, lord tarakudo,

242
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:28,113
I must seek a more
suitable host.

243
00:12:28,115 --> 00:12:29,581
Tohru: Raah!

244
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:35,754
It would seem my search
is already over.

245
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:38,857
Huh?

246
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:42,360
Hello? Rude to stare.

247
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:45,463
(Gasps)
Aiyaa.

248
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:47,298
The demon from
planet ura--

249
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,368
Jade!
Er, Neptune.

250
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,170
Shadowkhan, attack!

251
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,242
Huh?

252
00:12:57,244 --> 00:12:58,810
Shadow swords?

253
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:10,855
<i>Dokeru kimen yaaku...</i>

254
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:15,693
Grr...

255
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:18,062
Jade: Look what someone
tossed out, tarakudo.

256
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:21,132
Some perfectly good
<i>oni</i> poison.

257
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:24,736
No, anything but onions!

258
00:13:24,738 --> 00:13:26,905
Aah! Aah! My eyes! My eyes!

259
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:41,519
Hmph!
- Hmph!

260
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,088
Take the giant.

261
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:51,996
Jade, please tell
tohru to look out
behind...

262
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,399
Aiyaa!

263
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:56,034
Tohru?
- Tohru?
Tohru?

264
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:59,604
The giant will make
a most suitable host.

265
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:01,906
Yeah, better "t" than me.

266
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:03,741
Hey, say, Eddie,

267
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:06,311
chance we could swing
by a bathroom?

268
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,680
No!

269
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,683
Huh?

270
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:12,951
Oh, no.

271
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:14,686
Tohru.

272
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,192
Uncle: Ow!

273
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,194
Ow!

274
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:25,864
Ow!

275
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,466
Uncle, please.

276
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:30,435
No, uncle has it coming.

277
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:33,738
Ow! Uncle had opportunity
to warn tohru,

278
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,640
but did he? No!

279
00:14:35,642 --> 00:14:38,009
All because of silly
argument.

280
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:41,946
Now my apprentice
is in danger of
becoming demon.

281
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:43,848
Ow! One more thing:

282
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,016
Tohru was right.

283
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:49,787
Uncle says "one more thing"
too often!

284
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:52,790
Do not worry, uncle.

285
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:55,326
Ikazuki cannot remove
himself from Finn

286
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:58,029
without the mask removal
potion,

287
00:14:58,031 --> 00:15:00,465
and that is safe and sound.

288
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:03,134
In tohru's pocket?

289
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:07,572
Ohh. Bad day.

290
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:10,808
We must find tohru
before ikazuki finds potion

291
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:13,878
and places himself
on tohru's face!

292
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,647
But how do we find
tohru?

293
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:17,482
He got sucked
into the shadows.

294
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:18,783
Exactly.

295
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:30,161
Ikazuki: They tell me
you are a conjurer
of good magic.

296
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:34,198
They tell me you are
the maker of mask
removal potions,

297
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,769
so provide me with
the potion I require!

298
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:42,340
Your breath smells
like Finn's underwear.

299
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:44,909
Dude, let me have
a crack at it.

300
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:48,046
Tohru, t-man, buddy.

301
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:49,881
Look, maybe you haven't
noticed,

302
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:52,583
but I kind of have
a face on my sitting
place,

303
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:55,320
so I was wondering if
you could be a pal and--

304
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:58,323
the potion, or I shall
feast upon your brains!

305
00:15:58,325 --> 00:16:00,658
Ohh, the old
good cop, bad cop.

306
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,260
Come on, "t", help me
out here.

307
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:04,095
I <i> really</i> need
a potty break.

308
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:05,263
Insolent slug!

309
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:08,366
I command you
to produce the--

310
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:09,734
potion.

311
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:11,769
Ohh...

312
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:16,474
And to guide us to him,
a strand of tohru's hair.

313
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:20,778
He never did unclog sink.

314
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:26,918
Uncle are we sure
dabbling with shadow
magic is the best idea?

315
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:33,424
If we are to find where
shadowkhan are keeping tohru,

316
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:35,693
then like shadowkhan,

317
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:38,830
we must travel
through shadow.

318
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:43,334
Uncle!

319
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,037
Jackie!

320
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:49,107
Whoa!
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

321
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:51,209
Bad day! Bad day! Bad day!

322
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:58,783
Remove the wart from me

323
00:16:58,785 --> 00:17:03,254
and place my glorious
face upon the giant's
mighty form.

324
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:06,090
Whoo-hoo! Free
at last, baby.

325
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:07,959
No. Anything but <i> oni.</i>

326
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:18,603
Well, what are you
waiting for?!

327
00:17:18,605 --> 00:17:21,272
Uh, well, this is
kind of awkward.

328
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:22,507
Simpleton!

329
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:23,808
Do as you are told!

330
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,076
What he said.

331
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:29,013
Ok, but we are never
gonna bring this up again.

332
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:30,748
I'm not even here.

333
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:35,620
Attack!

334
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:42,693
Uncle: Tohru!

335
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:43,961
Sensei.

336
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,465
Uh, glad you guys
are talking again,

337
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:49,067
but talk later!

338
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:51,402
Hyah!
- Hyah!

339
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:03,981
Tohru! Where is
the potion?!

340
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:05,416
Uh, Jackie?

341
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,618
Here goes nothing.

342
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,187
Not now, fool!

343
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,690
I would lose control
of my shadowkhan

344
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:15,860
for the brief duration
my face is between hosts!

345
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,898
Tohru! Behind you!

346
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,467
Sensei, watch out!

347
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:23,801
Hyah!
- Aah!

348
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:28,439
Jackie, watch your
behind--er, behind you!

349
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,181
Graah!

350
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:49,694
Whoa! Ohh...

351
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:54,365
Jade: Yo, Finn! Heeyah!

352
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:55,533
Whoa!

353
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:59,804
Talk about your ancient
art of butt whoop--ohh!

354
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,074
Uhh...

355
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:07,945
Ratso, low 5!

356
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:10,815
Yes!

357
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,917
Ohh...

358
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:14,185
No. No!

359
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:17,722
No.

360
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:25,363
No!

361
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,836
End of the line,
wart.

362
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:34,205
Infidel. I will have
my revenge!

363
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,244
Uh...Gotta go.

364
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,448
Heh heh heh heh.
Heh heh heh heh.

365
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:47,585
Fools, I shall claim
a new mighty form

366
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:50,621
and devour your--

367
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,891
blah, blah, blah.

368
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:55,726
Thank you, Jade.

369
00:19:55,728 --> 00:20:00,064
Yes, all that chatter
was giving uncle
headache.

370
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:05,203
Besides, there are
others whom I would
rather hear speak.

371
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:06,904
Likewise, sensei.

372
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:09,574
Chow: Hey, yo, Finn.

373
00:20:09,576 --> 00:20:13,644
What's the big rush?
- Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go!

374
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:23,621
Hey, Jackie,
- do you like to eat raw fish?

375
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:25,489
Yeah, raw fish, yes, I do.

376
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:29,493
When I eat Japanese food,
and the Sushi,

377
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:31,362
I do eat raw fish,

378
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:33,397
but I have to put a lot
of wasabi.

379
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:39,303
Sometimes I ask myself,
"do I like raw fish
or wasabi?" I don't know.

380
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:41,772
But you give me raw fish,
I don't like it,

381
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:44,375
but with wasabi, yes.

382
00:20:44,377 --> 00:20:45,977
I like raw fish.
