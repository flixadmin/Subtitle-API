1
00:00:00,666 --> 00:00:02,893
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:05,148 --> 00:00:07,044
After 5 years in hell...

3
00:00:07,045 --> 00:00:10,074
I returned home with only one goal...

4
00:00:10,075 --> 00:00:11,841
To save my city.

5
00:00:12,797 --> 00:00:16,182
For 8 years, I've fought
alongside brave men and women

6
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:17,965
striving for justice,

7
00:00:17,966 --> 00:00:19,634
but then a Crisis came,

8
00:00:19,635 --> 00:00:22,168
and I had to become someone else.

9
00:00:22,204 --> 00:00:25,471
I had to become something else.

10
00:00:25,507 --> 00:00:27,809
I made the ultimate sacrifice,

11
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,579
which helped birth an
entirely new universe.

12
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,648
Now my friends and family will
have to go on without me,

13
00:00:34,783 --> 00:00:37,151
and although I have become a spectre,

14
00:00:37,152 --> 00:00:39,522
there is a part of me that will always be

15
00:00:39,523 --> 00:00:41,035
the Green Arrow.

Both my children will live.

18
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:59,098
Mom... what are you doing?

19
00:00:59,233 --> 00:01:01,801
- Thea, I love you.
- No.

20
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:03,570
Close your eyes, baby.

21
00:01:03,705 --> 00:01:05,738
No!

22
00:01:05,874 --> 00:01:09,209
You possess true courage, Moira.

23
00:01:13,515 --> 00:01:15,515
I'm truly sorry...

24
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:23,723
You did not pass that on to your son.

25
00:01:34,102 --> 00:01:37,470
It's just such a strange thing to learn

26
00:01:37,606 --> 00:01:40,106
that there's a whole other...

27
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,312
World, I guess...

28
00:01:47,115 --> 00:01:49,215
Where I died.

29
00:01:50,284 --> 00:01:52,952
The people that knew my son best tell me

30
00:01:53,087 --> 00:01:57,355
that when Oliver sacrificed
himself during the Crisis...

31
00:01:57,356 --> 00:01:59,795
OLIVER QUEEN DIES DURING WORLD WIDE CRISIS

32
00:01:59,796 --> 00:02:06,099
that somehow he's the reason
that everything changed,

33
00:02:06,235 --> 00:02:09,002
that the world we're living in right now is

34
00:02:09,137 --> 00:02:11,604
a kind of gift from him.

35
00:02:16,277 --> 00:02:19,078
I don't know. I'm just
trying to process it.

36
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:25,985
I... I think we're all still
trying to process it,

37
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,655
not only Oliver's death...

38
00:02:28,855 --> 00:02:29,855
DINAH DRAKE
SCPD CAPTAIN

39
00:02:31,292 --> 00:02:34,861
but what he leaves behind.

40
00:02:34,996 --> 00:02:36,619
It's a hell of a legacy.

RENE RAMIREZ
"WILD DOG"

42
00:02:37,885 --> 00:02:41,801
not just a city of heroes,

43
00:02:41,936 --> 00:02:45,071
a world of heroes.

44
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:46,639
When I started this project,

45
00:02:46,775 --> 00:02:49,476
it was intended to explore the history

46
00:02:49,611 --> 00:02:52,582
and the pitfalls of
vigilantism in Star City.

47

MARCIA PEDOWITZ
DIRECTOR: EMERALD ARCHER

48
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:58,284
I never thought this documentary
would have to be retooled

49
00:02:58,419 --> 00:03:01,588
to be a memorial.

50
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,657
Nothing really ever... happens

51
00:03:03,792 --> 00:03:06,338
the way you expect it to happen...

JOHN DIGGLE
"SPARTAN"

53
00:03:07,986 --> 00:03:11,898
and that was... certainly the case...

54
00:03:12,033 --> 00:03:15,769
With Oliver and his mission.

55
00:03:16,771 --> 00:03:20,073
He always said he would go it alone

56
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:23,976
and that the mission would never...

57
00:03:24,112 --> 00:03:26,846
Be over.

58
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:30,884
I'm glad he was... wrong
about the first part...

59
00:03:34,523 --> 00:03:37,390
Heartbroken he was wrong about the second.

60
00:03:37,526 --> 00:03:39,926
Thank you.

61
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,730
That was very moving.

62
00:03:46,535 --> 00:03:47,900
Yeah.

63
00:03:53,908 --> 00:03:56,142
- Hey, hey.
- Hey, man.

64
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:57,510
You all right?

65
00:03:57,646 --> 00:03:59,746
Everything good.

66
00:03:59,881 --> 00:04:02,648
Why do I get the sense that
answer disappoints you?

67
00:04:04,446 --> 00:04:06,586
I just can't believe it, you know?

68
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:12,191
Let's go.

69
00:04:16,665 --> 00:04:19,933
When Oliver rebooted the universe,

70
00:04:20,068 --> 00:04:22,001
he fixed things.

71
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:24,804
Ever since the Crisis,

72
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:28,407
crime in Star City disappeared overnight

73
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,042
literally.

74
00:04:33,047 --> 00:04:37,249
Dig, he... he saved this city.

75
00:04:39,588 --> 00:04:41,654
Yeah.

76
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,390
Come on. It's time.

77
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,060
Prochnost.

78
00:04:51,344 --> 00:04:52,699
I didn't know you speak Russian.

79
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,167
No. That's what Oliver used to say

80
00:04:54,302 --> 00:04:55,702
every time he drank this stuff.

81
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,570
- What exactly is this stuff?
- Vodka.

82
00:04:57,706 --> 00:04:59,305
Yeah. It tastes like Turpentine.

83
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,208
With faint hints of nail polish remover.

84
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:04,176
So what's the plan?

85
00:05:04,312 --> 00:05:06,078
I plan on getting as drunk

86
00:05:06,214 --> 00:05:08,247
as humanly possible.

87
00:05:08,382 --> 00:05:11,017
No. I mean after the funeral.

88
00:05:11,152 --> 00:05:12,685
From what Dinah tells me,

89
00:05:12,821 --> 00:05:14,486
there's not much need
for vigilantes anymore.

90
00:05:14,622 --> 00:05:17,223
Lance's term ends in April.

91
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:19,091
He's endorsing me to replace him.

92
00:05:19,227 --> 00:05:21,574
- As mayor?
- No. As a bald guy with an attitude.

93
00:05:21,575 --> 00:05:23,295
Yeah, as mayor.

94
00:05:23,431 --> 00:05:25,064
What about you, D?

95
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,767
Mayor.. for now at
least... Lance actually just

96
00:05:27,903 --> 00:05:31,237
offered me a promotion to Chief of Police.

97
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:33,440
Guys, look. I know how this looks.

98
00:05:33,575 --> 00:05:35,108
I just don't feel like this is over.

99
00:05:35,243 --> 00:05:38,011
Yeah. You're not reading the
same CompStat reports I am.

100
00:05:38,146 --> 00:05:40,913
We're a month out of this Crisis, Dinah,

101
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,149
and there's tons that we don't know,

102
00:05:43,284 --> 00:05:45,184
but what I do know is this.

103
00:05:46,855 --> 00:05:50,322
Though Oliver's gone, his mission

104
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,191
is far from over.

105
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,633
Finally. What the hell happened?

106
00:06:00,769 --> 00:06:03,202
Jimmy Tarallo gave me a few problems.

107
00:06:03,338 --> 00:06:05,571
And by a few, you mean a
dozen men armed with knives?

108
00:06:05,706 --> 00:06:08,241
No. I mean 22 with machetes.

109
00:06:08,376 --> 00:06:10,009
Queen, you shouldn't be doing this alone.

110
00:06:10,144 --> 00:06:11,577
You're not ready to go
into the field, Diggle.

111
00:06:11,712 --> 00:06:12,756
Yeah? Well, when I signed on,

112
00:06:12,757 --> 00:06:15,081
I told you I was here to
keep the body count low.

113
00:06:15,216 --> 00:06:16,716
That includes you.

114
00:06:16,851 --> 00:06:18,017
Well, I'm fine.

115
00:06:18,152 --> 00:06:19,819
And Tarallo?

116
00:06:19,954 --> 00:06:21,654
A little less so.

117
00:06:26,827 --> 00:06:28,027
What's this?

118
00:06:28,162 --> 00:06:29,628
The next name on the list.

119
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:32,431
John Byrne? What's the
CEO of a beer company

120
00:06:32,566 --> 00:06:34,567
have to do to deserve an
arrow between the eyes?

121
00:06:34,703 --> 00:06:36,102
Well, the company's a front.

122
00:06:36,237 --> 00:06:37,670
He's using his trucks to ferry

123
00:06:37,806 --> 00:06:39,939
a very different type of commodity.

124
00:06:40,075 --> 00:06:41,941
Drugs?

125
00:06:42,076 --> 00:06:44,010
People.

126
00:06:44,145 --> 00:06:46,412
Human trafficking? Where does this end?

127
00:06:46,547 --> 00:06:47,846
How many names are on your list?

128
00:06:47,982 --> 00:06:49,482
Too many to cross off. Listen, Diggle.

129
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:52,418
This doesn't end.

130
00:06:52,553 --> 00:06:54,521
The mission is never over.

131
00:07:03,013 --> 00:07:05,012
You can survive this,

132
00:07:05,147 --> 00:07:08,783
make it home, right my wrongs,

133
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:10,951
but you got to live through this first.

134
00:07:19,962 --> 00:07:21,829
Survive.

135
00:07:21,964 --> 00:07:23,030
No!

136
00:07:33,376 --> 00:07:35,676
- Hey.
- What the frak?

137
00:07:35,812 --> 00:07:38,045
Sorry. I... I didn't mean to scare you.

138
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,780
I meant to time portal to your front door,

139
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:43,117
but I guess I... I overshot the mark a bit.

140
00:07:43,253 --> 00:07:45,019
This is a... this is a nice room.

141
00:07:45,155 --> 00:07:47,121
Time portal?

142
00:07:47,257 --> 00:07:49,624
Yeah. I'm a time traveler, remember?

143
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,628
Right. Ok. And why did
you time travel here?

144
00:07:54,764 --> 00:07:57,698
Because I'm here to take you
to your father's funeral.

145
00:08:08,289 --> 00:08:10,044
You know, I actually
should have tried that sooner.

146
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,013
It's not that hard, actually.

147
00:08:12,148 --> 00:08:15,250
That's because your arms are
the size of telephone poles.

148
00:08:15,385 --> 00:08:17,351
You doing ok?

149
00:08:17,487 --> 00:08:18,853
When am I never not ok?

150
00:08:18,988 --> 00:08:21,289
I don't think any of us are really ok,

151
00:08:21,424 --> 00:08:24,692
but it seems to be hitting
you particularly hard.

152
00:08:24,827 --> 00:08:27,195
I'm fine, like always.

153
00:08:28,831 --> 00:08:30,064
You ready?

154
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,733
- Yeah. Let's do this.
- Yeah.

155
00:08:32,835 --> 00:08:35,169
So what did Oliver call this thing?

156
00:08:35,305 --> 00:08:38,306
He called it the Mark of Four.

157
00:08:40,343 --> 00:08:42,510
So how you doing?

158
00:08:43,894 --> 00:08:46,714
I'm just... I'm nervous
about the funeral.

159
00:08:46,849 --> 00:08:48,349
Yeah.

160
00:08:48,485 --> 00:08:50,718
Yeah. You know, Thea's gonna be there.

161
00:08:50,853 --> 00:08:53,821
Imagine both of Oliver's
sisters would be there.

162
00:08:53,957 --> 00:08:56,925
I kind of left Thea abruptly.

163
00:08:57,385 --> 00:08:59,627
You're worried about
an awkward reunion.

164
00:08:59,762 --> 00:09:01,729
I'm worried about any kind of reunion.

165
00:09:01,864 --> 00:09:03,431
Well, hey. Look at it this way.

166
00:09:03,566 --> 00:09:05,366
After fighting the Mirakuru soldiers

167
00:09:05,501 --> 00:09:07,301
and the Thanatos Guild,

168
00:09:07,437 --> 00:09:09,537
seeing your ex-girlfriend should be cake.

169
00:09:09,672 --> 00:09:11,238
That's why I'm scared.

170
00:09:13,109 --> 00:09:15,743
I don't want her to be my ex-girlfriend.

171
00:09:18,548 --> 00:09:21,015
So when's Felicity get to town?

172
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,117
I don't know if she's coming.

173
00:09:23,252 --> 00:09:24,718
It's her husband's funeral, man.

174
00:09:24,854 --> 00:09:27,788
Which is exactly why I
think she might miss it.

175
00:09:27,924 --> 00:09:30,525
I don't know, Rene.

176
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,626
She has a nanny watching Mia right now.

177
00:09:32,762 --> 00:09:36,497
Felicity hasn't even made it out of bed.

178
00:09:36,632 --> 00:09:38,632
I have no idea how to help her.

179
00:09:40,703 --> 00:09:42,337
At least bring me for backup.

180
00:09:42,472 --> 00:09:44,338
How many times are we gonna
go over this, Diggle?

181
00:09:44,474 --> 00:09:45,973
You know, I went through
Byrne's financials.

182
00:09:46,108 --> 00:09:47,641
Every month, he gives over $1 million

183
00:09:47,777 --> 00:09:49,644
to this outfit called Black Armada.

184
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:53,514
- You know who they are?
- Private security firm.

185
00:09:53,649 --> 00:09:55,516
- Former Special Forces.
- That's right,

186
00:09:55,652 --> 00:09:56,985
and you don't think it's
a good idea to bring

187
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,052
a former soldier of your own?

188
00:09:59,188 --> 00:10:00,754
No.

189
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,857
You know what I think?

190
00:10:02,993 --> 00:10:03,931
I don't think you really want me there.

191
00:10:03,932 --> 00:10:05,542
Thanks for finally getting my point.

192
00:10:05,543 --> 00:10:08,195
I don't think you want me
there because you're afraid

193
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:11,298
I will stop you from committing
cold-blooded murder.

194
00:10:16,038 --> 00:10:18,106
You think that your role is
to keep the body count low.

195
00:10:18,241 --> 00:10:20,875
There's a way you can stop him
tonight without killing him.

196
00:10:21,011 --> 00:10:22,643
You could take him to prison,

197
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:24,312
you could see that justice is served.

198
00:10:24,447 --> 00:10:27,781
The man traffics in human beings.

199
00:10:27,917 --> 00:10:31,018
- Killing him is justice.
- But at what cost?

200
00:10:31,153 --> 00:10:32,953
You say your mission will never end.
Well, trust me,

201
00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:35,923
it will end a lot sooner
if you lose who you are.

202
00:10:46,836 --> 00:10:49,270
Mia?

203
00:10:49,405 --> 00:10:51,172
Don't worry. The Monitor didn't drop me off

204
00:10:51,307 --> 00:10:53,040
because there's another Crisis coming.

205
00:10:53,175 --> 00:10:55,476
That still doesn't explain
what you're doing here.

206
00:10:55,612 --> 00:10:57,378
Laurel's sister showed up,

207
00:10:57,514 --> 00:11:01,415
thought I might enjoy going
to my dad's funeral.

208
00:11:01,551 --> 00:11:04,752
And what are you doing with all this stuff?

209
00:11:04,887 --> 00:11:08,556
Trying my best to channel my mom.

210
00:11:08,691 --> 00:11:11,058
Sorry. When Sara dropped me off,

211
00:11:11,193 --> 00:11:13,427
she gave me this whole lecture
about not telling people

212
00:11:13,563 --> 00:11:15,530
about the future, so...

213
00:11:17,967 --> 00:11:20,434
A few weeks before Sara showed up...

214
00:11:22,238 --> 00:11:24,105
Something happened.

215
00:11:26,308 --> 00:11:28,709
William!

216
00:11:28,845 --> 00:11:33,214
Right in front of me. I couldn't
do anything to stop it, and...

217
00:11:35,384 --> 00:11:39,052
I am already failing at
being the Green Arrow.

218
00:11:39,053 --> 00:11:41,302
What we do is not easy.

219
00:11:41,303 --> 00:11:44,037
There are setbacks, there are tragedies,

220
00:11:44,172 --> 00:11:46,006
but, God, Mia, your father,

221
00:11:46,141 --> 00:11:50,443
he would be so, so proud

222
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:53,046
of how you're carrying all of that.

223
00:11:53,181 --> 00:11:55,215
I can't even do the one thing that

224
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:58,751
he risked his entire life to do...

225
00:11:58,887 --> 00:12:01,288
Protect my family.

226
00:12:04,626 --> 00:12:05,859
What's this?

227
00:12:05,995 --> 00:12:08,029
Well, your mother's Archer Protocol scans

228
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,130
news stations for certain key words.

229
00:12:15,237 --> 00:12:17,137
William Clayton, the son

230
00:12:17,272 --> 00:12:19,139
of the late hero Oliver Queen,

231
00:12:19,274 --> 00:12:21,774
was abducted tonight in his
hometown of Central City.

232
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,710
The police have been unable to confirm

233
00:12:23,846 --> 00:12:26,346
any suspects in the kidnapping.

234
00:12:37,895 --> 00:12:41,263
- Hey.
- Hey.

235
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,732
Look. I'm sorry about the way that I left.

236
00:12:43,867 --> 00:12:45,134
I just...

237
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:46,768
Ollie's just passed away,

238
00:12:46,904 --> 00:12:48,570
and William's been kidnapped,

239
00:12:48,706 --> 00:12:51,306
so... as far as apologies go,

240
00:12:51,442 --> 00:12:54,075
your timing's a little not great.

241
00:12:54,211 --> 00:12:56,412
If you still think Oliver's
mission's finished,

242
00:12:56,547 --> 00:12:58,314
tell that to William when we get him back.

243
00:12:58,449 --> 00:13:00,549
We will get him back, but, John, William

244
00:13:00,684 --> 00:13:02,518
was kidnapped outside of Star City.

245
00:13:02,653 --> 00:13:05,087
I'm sure that will make him
feel a whole lot better.

246
00:13:05,222 --> 00:13:07,456
- I reached out to Felicity.
- Yeah. Me, too.

247
00:13:07,591 --> 00:13:09,892
Radio silence.

248
00:13:10,027 --> 00:13:12,628
I asked Sara to check on her.

249
00:13:17,814 --> 00:13:20,202
I haven't seen this many
people down here in a while.

250
00:13:22,306 --> 00:13:23,638
Hey.

251
00:13:28,146 --> 00:13:29,744
Hey.

252
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,616
It's almost like a party.

253
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,100
I tried running a
quad-grid search tasked

254
00:13:45,101 --> 00:13:46,208
to a keyhole satellite array, but...

255
00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:48,666
That array's dark-sided as it
undergoes a firmware upgrade,

256
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:50,442
but fortunately when William
moved to Central City,

257
00:13:50,443 --> 00:13:53,369
his overbearing stepmom implanted
a subdermal tracking device

258
00:13:53,504 --> 00:13:55,777
into his arm. Ethical... debatable.

259
00:13:55,778 --> 00:13:58,240
Which went dark as soon as
he reentered Star City.

260
00:13:58,376 --> 00:14:00,108
Well, that's convenient at least.

261
00:14:00,244 --> 00:14:02,077
Just one second as I work up a
statistically correlated list

262
00:14:02,213 --> 00:14:04,180
of possible locations he could be at.

263
00:14:04,315 --> 00:14:05,647
That is a very long list.

264
00:14:05,782 --> 00:14:08,350
Which is exactly why we called everyone.

265
00:14:08,486 --> 00:14:10,452
Thank you all for coming,

266
00:14:11,922 --> 00:14:14,123
some on very short notice.

267
00:14:15,726 --> 00:14:17,059
Oliver made the ultimate sacrifice

268
00:14:17,194 --> 00:14:20,895
for his friends and his family.

269
00:14:21,031 --> 00:14:23,232
Now a part of his family needs our help.

270
00:14:23,367 --> 00:14:26,535
This is our most important mission.

271
00:14:28,939 --> 00:14:30,305
Suit up.

272
00:14:41,485 --> 00:14:44,119
Ok. Well, he's not here.

273
00:14:44,255 --> 00:14:46,355
What was the next place on Felicity's list?

274
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:47,922
Kord Industries.

275
00:14:48,058 --> 00:14:49,458
All right. Well, let's go.

276
00:14:49,593 --> 00:14:51,693
Hey. Can I talk to you for a second?

277
00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:54,396
You already did back at the Bunker, ok?

278
00:14:54,531 --> 00:14:57,232
I get it. You're sorry.

279
00:14:57,368 --> 00:14:59,034
No. I never told you why I left.

280
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:01,337
And you don't need to.

281
00:15:01,472 --> 00:15:03,772
I understand. You were going through a lot.

282
00:15:03,908 --> 00:15:06,541
Dying, getting resurrected,

283
00:15:06,677 --> 00:15:11,080
it gave me a whole new
perspective on... on everything,

284
00:15:11,215 --> 00:15:13,715
including you.

285
00:15:13,851 --> 00:15:15,617
You know, I got my whole life back,

286
00:15:15,753 --> 00:15:18,420
and I realized that I wanted you in it...

287
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:24,159
Forever and... and always.

288
00:15:24,295 --> 00:15:27,329
And what does that mean?

289
00:15:27,464 --> 00:15:29,698
It means...

290
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:32,301
Will you marry me?

291
00:15:38,075 --> 00:15:41,243
Get out.

292
00:15:41,378 --> 00:15:46,215
Get out!

293
00:15:50,688 --> 00:15:54,222
Nice. I would have some shots in the air.

294
00:15:54,358 --> 00:15:57,326
My way's scarier.

295
00:15:57,428 --> 00:16:00,796
So how are things?

296
00:16:00,965 --> 00:16:02,631
It's been a while.

297
00:16:03,968 --> 00:16:06,768
Yeah. Well, a while is what it took

298
00:16:06,904 --> 00:16:08,737
for these rags to work again.

299
00:16:08,872 --> 00:16:12,708
Since then, I've been fighting for justice.

300
00:16:12,843 --> 00:16:14,843
To honor your father?

301
00:16:14,978 --> 00:16:17,579
To honor Oliver.

302
00:16:17,715 --> 00:16:19,848
We've had our differences over the years.

303
00:16:19,983 --> 00:16:22,284
Yeah, I assumed.

304
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,185
Why?

305
00:16:25,589 --> 00:16:28,524
Of everyone,

306
00:16:28,659 --> 00:16:32,194
you're the most like him.

307
00:16:41,539 --> 00:16:43,939
- Clear!
- Clear!

308
00:16:44,074 --> 00:16:45,340
Damn it!

309
00:16:45,476 --> 00:16:48,009
- What?
- He's not here.

310
00:16:48,145 --> 00:16:49,911
Curtis said there's a bunch
of places he could still be.

311
00:16:50,047 --> 00:16:51,580
- Well, we need to find him.
- We will.

312
00:16:51,715 --> 00:16:53,248
We have to find him, Johnny.

313
00:16:53,384 --> 00:16:55,484
We will, Lyla. Are you ok?

314
00:16:55,619 --> 00:16:58,520
Oliver put our family back together.

315
00:16:58,655 --> 00:17:03,859
What happens if... if we
can't do the same for his?

316
00:17:03,995 --> 00:17:06,996
Lyla, look at me. We can,

317
00:17:07,131 --> 00:17:09,197
and we will, I promise.

318
00:17:25,016 --> 00:17:26,815
Let him go!

319
00:17:32,512 --> 00:17:34,223
Who the hell are you?!

320
00:17:38,856 --> 00:17:40,688
I said, who are you?!

321
00:17:40,824 --> 00:17:43,758
You're wearing his hood. You should know.

322
00:18:39,716 --> 00:18:41,917
No, please, please.

323
00:20:49,312 --> 00:20:50,779
You stay back!

324
00:20:50,914 --> 00:20:52,247
John Byrne...

325
00:20:52,382 --> 00:20:55,916
You have failed this city.

326
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:02,056
Let him go!

327
00:21:02,192 --> 00:21:04,725
I brought him up here to throw him off.

328
00:21:04,861 --> 00:21:06,661
My whole life ended right here!

329
00:21:06,797 --> 00:21:10,298
I don't care! Final warning.

330
00:21:10,433 --> 00:21:12,733
He thought he was saving me.

331
00:21:12,869 --> 00:21:15,536
8 years in Iron Heights never saved anyone.

332
00:21:15,672 --> 00:21:17,071
So you kidnap his son,

333
00:21:17,207 --> 00:21:18,506
the man who spared your life?

334
00:21:18,641 --> 00:21:20,575
I should put this arrow in you right now!

335
00:21:20,711 --> 00:21:22,977
Do it! After 8 years in prison,

336
00:21:23,113 --> 00:21:26,280
I got nothing left to live for anyway!

337
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:28,082
Go ahead!

338
00:21:40,663 --> 00:21:44,399
No. If Oliver Queen didn't kill you,

339
00:21:44,534 --> 00:21:46,600
then neither will I,

340
00:21:46,736 --> 00:21:49,237
but your ass is going back to prison.

341
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:54,175
This is the riser,

342
00:21:54,456 --> 00:21:56,811
this is the arrow shelf,

343
00:21:56,947 --> 00:21:58,579
and this is the fadeout.

344
00:21:58,714 --> 00:22:00,381
That's really cool.

345
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,119
That's...

346
00:22:07,757 --> 00:22:09,790
Mia.

347
00:22:09,926 --> 00:22:12,093
Must be a lot to take in.

348
00:22:12,229 --> 00:22:14,128
Yeah. That's the...

349
00:22:14,264 --> 00:22:17,098
Understatement of the Millennium.

350
00:22:17,233 --> 00:22:19,267
She became a hero.

351
00:22:19,402 --> 00:22:21,469
Well, she had good parents.

352
00:22:23,473 --> 00:22:27,242
Do you... you want to meet her?

353
00:22:27,377 --> 00:22:28,976
I don't know.

354
00:22:30,713 --> 00:22:32,080
She... she might be here,

355
00:22:32,215 --> 00:22:36,784
but she's... she's also at home,

356
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,088
waiting for me,

357
00:22:40,223 --> 00:22:42,757
and I get to see her grow up.

358
00:22:48,999 --> 00:22:51,966
I'm not sure I want to rush that.

359
00:22:54,271 --> 00:22:55,836
- Hey.
- Hey.

360
00:22:55,972 --> 00:22:57,705
Something on the news you should see.

361
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,474
What?

362
00:23:06,616 --> 00:23:08,817
William Clayton was safely recovered

363
00:23:08,952 --> 00:23:10,718
from his kidnapper John Byrne.

364
00:23:10,853 --> 00:23:12,921
Apparently the abduction was revenge

365
00:23:13,056 --> 00:23:16,457
for Oliver Queen bringing
Byrne to justice 8 years ago.

366
00:23:16,592 --> 00:23:19,693
We have exclusive footage of the rescue.

367
00:23:25,968 --> 00:23:28,436
With Oliver Queen confirmed dead,

368
00:23:28,571 --> 00:23:31,239
we can only speculate that he inspired

369
00:23:31,374 --> 00:23:36,010
a new generation of heroes
to carry on his mission.

370
00:23:37,213 --> 00:23:41,716
Like I said... proud.

371
00:23:53,445 --> 00:23:54,445
Diggle?!

372
00:23:56,797 --> 00:23:59,233
Don't use just your arms.

373
00:24:00,769 --> 00:24:02,702
Power's coming from your hips.

374
00:24:08,077 --> 00:24:09,909
Thanks for the tip.

375
00:24:10,045 --> 00:24:11,878
Just get real good at that,

376
00:24:12,014 --> 00:24:14,481
and maybe I'll eventually
take you out in the field.

377
00:24:17,453 --> 00:24:21,054
Byrne didn't really have
a good night, did he?

378
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:23,623
He had a better night than you think.

379
00:24:28,263 --> 00:24:31,297
He's being arraigned in the morning.

380
00:24:33,402 --> 00:24:36,737
Plenty of people in this
book that deserve to die,

381
00:24:36,872 --> 00:24:39,273
plain and simple,

382
00:24:39,408 --> 00:24:41,942
but probably not everyone.

383
00:24:42,077 --> 00:24:46,780
Let's consider Mr. John Byrne to be

384
00:24:46,915 --> 00:24:48,348
proof of concept.

385
00:24:48,484 --> 00:24:50,484
That people can be redeemed?

386
00:24:50,619 --> 00:24:52,953
That one day I'll be able to trust you.

387
00:25:13,275 --> 00:25:15,275
Your mom let me in.

388
00:25:15,411 --> 00:25:17,511
Is it just me, or does the new Moira

389
00:25:17,646 --> 00:25:20,381
seem to like me a lot
more than the old Moira?

390
00:25:20,516 --> 00:25:23,183
Yeah. She never really liked you that much,

391
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:25,519
but in her defense, you were a criminal.

392
00:25:25,654 --> 00:25:27,688
Well, I regret nothing.

393
00:25:27,823 --> 00:25:29,056
If I never stole your purse,

394
00:25:29,191 --> 00:25:31,591
then I never would have met you,

395
00:25:31,727 --> 00:25:33,427
and even if you do say no to my proposal,

396
00:25:33,562 --> 00:25:38,365
which I... I really hope you don't...

397
00:25:38,501 --> 00:25:41,701
Loving you has changed my life, Thea.

398
00:25:41,837 --> 00:25:43,937
If Ollie's death has taught me anything,

399
00:25:44,073 --> 00:25:48,675
it's... that we don't have a
lot of time in this life.

400
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,047
As long as you promise

401
00:25:53,182 --> 00:25:55,649
if you ever freak out
on me like that again,

402
00:25:55,784 --> 00:25:58,618
you tell me instead of just leaving.

403
00:25:58,754 --> 00:26:01,421
Yeah, yeah. I can make that promise.

404
00:26:03,325 --> 00:26:05,392
Then yes.

405
00:26:05,528 --> 00:26:07,260
Yes?

406
00:26:07,395 --> 00:26:09,896
I will marry you, Roy Harper.

407
00:26:23,412 --> 00:26:26,146
Hey. What are you doing here?

408
00:26:26,282 --> 00:26:27,514
Looking for you.

409
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:29,083
Well, I was just looking for Dinah.

410
00:26:29,218 --> 00:26:31,184
I think she's... ghosting me.

411
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:32,786
Do you have a second to talk?

412
00:26:32,921 --> 00:26:35,722
Want to step into not my office?

413
00:26:42,665 --> 00:26:45,766
So... what's up?

414
00:26:45,934 --> 00:26:47,534
It's about Oliver.

415
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:50,970
Well, not exactly him, but...

416
00:26:51,106 --> 00:26:53,273
Who his sacrifice brought back.

417
00:26:53,409 --> 00:26:57,544
- Like me?
- And Tommy and Moira...

418
00:27:00,248 --> 00:27:01,748
But not me

419
00:27:01,884 --> 00:27:07,053
or the other me, yo...

420
00:27:07,188 --> 00:27:08,422
Your Laurel.

421
00:27:08,557 --> 00:27:10,089
Look. We don't exactly know the rules

422
00:27:10,225 --> 00:27:11,391
of this whole resurrection thing.

423
00:27:11,527 --> 00:27:12,759
Yes, we do.

424
00:27:12,895 --> 00:27:14,628
You're all of the people who Oliver

425
00:27:14,763 --> 00:27:17,231
would have wanted his
sacrifice to bring back,

426
00:27:17,366 --> 00:27:21,267
and Laurel, she... she would have been

427
00:27:21,403 --> 00:27:26,440
on that list, too, if it wasn't for me.

428
00:27:26,575 --> 00:27:30,777
Oliver's death, it fixed everything else.

429
00:27:30,913 --> 00:27:33,647
Why didn't it fix this, too?

430
00:27:33,782 --> 00:27:36,783
Because, sweetheart, there
is nothing about you

431
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:38,985
that needed to be fixed.

432
00:27:45,861 --> 00:27:47,361
It's all right.

433
00:27:56,438 --> 00:27:58,171
Dig, what's going on?

434
00:27:58,306 --> 00:28:00,106
The end of the line.

435
00:28:00,242 --> 00:28:02,776
You were right. The mission's over.

436
00:28:02,911 --> 00:28:05,111
Just took me a while to accept that.

437
00:28:07,549 --> 00:28:08,815
I think accepting that meant accepting

438
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:11,151
that Oliver was really gone.

439
00:28:14,557 --> 00:28:17,491
You know, Sara said that before Oliver died

440
00:28:17,626 --> 00:28:19,793
that he became something else.

441
00:28:19,928 --> 00:28:23,630
I'd like to think that somehow, someway,

442
00:28:23,766 --> 00:28:25,298
he's still here.

443
00:28:25,433 --> 00:28:26,866
I'd drink to that.

444
00:28:27,002 --> 00:28:29,703
Just as long as it's no more
of that godawful vodka.

445
00:28:32,241 --> 00:28:35,676
Ok. Cool. So... you're moving on.

446
00:28:35,811 --> 00:28:37,176
So what's next for you?

447
00:28:37,312 --> 00:28:39,413
Lyla accepted a promotion in Metropolis,

448
00:28:39,548 --> 00:28:43,349
so we're all gonna move
there after the funeral.

449
00:28:43,485 --> 00:28:45,452
So am I.

450
00:28:45,587 --> 00:28:48,121
I'm not gonna take the promotion.

451
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:51,291
Just no point being police in a safe city,

452
00:28:51,427 --> 00:28:54,594
and there are lots of cities
that still need saving.

453
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:59,132
Damn, and here I am getting to
be elected in a few months,

454
00:28:59,268 --> 00:29:01,935
and you guys decide to move away.

455
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:04,738
Kind of hard not to take that personally.

456
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,807
Don't worry, Rene. You are
gonna be a great mayor

457
00:29:07,943 --> 00:29:09,976
because you're a great man.

458
00:29:10,111 --> 00:29:12,679
I learned from the best.

459
00:29:12,815 --> 00:29:14,180
Oliver.

460
00:29:14,316 --> 00:29:16,215
And the two of you.

461
00:29:24,793 --> 00:29:26,793
Who's getting the lights?

462
00:29:26,928 --> 00:29:28,227
I will.

463
00:29:50,686 --> 00:29:52,485
I'm gonna miss this place.

464
00:29:54,056 --> 00:29:55,989
We all will.

465
00:30:10,536 --> 00:30:12,369
Thank you for coming.

466
00:30:14,111 --> 00:30:16,312
For a long time...

467
00:30:18,248 --> 00:30:20,616
I hated Oliver Queen.

468
00:30:20,751 --> 00:30:27,255
I blamed him for the death
of my youngest daughter,

469
00:30:27,391 --> 00:30:32,060
I blamed him for the violence in my city,

470
00:30:32,196 --> 00:30:36,298
I interrogated him, I hunted him,

471
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:38,367
persecuted him.

472
00:30:40,771 --> 00:30:44,206
I've never been more wrong in my life.

473
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:47,175
Oliver Queen wasn't just a hero.

474
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:52,348
He was a good man.

475
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:54,950
He was an honorable person.

476
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:56,952
The fact that he didn't start out that way

477
00:30:57,087 --> 00:31:00,188
makes him, in my book,

478
00:31:00,324 --> 00:31:02,958
even more honorable.

479
00:31:03,093 --> 00:31:06,929
He stands as a reminder to all of us

480
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:09,264
that anyone can change.

481
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:14,770
So will this.

482
00:31:18,291 --> 00:31:23,178
HE SAVED THIS CITY - OLIVER QUEEN
GREEN ARROW

483
00:31:56,847 --> 00:31:58,747
I just don't understand.

484
00:31:58,882 --> 00:32:00,415
If Ollie could fix everything,

485
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:04,453
then why couldn't he fix this?

486
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:08,290
I think that Oliver could
only change the things

487
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,859
that didn't change him,

488
00:32:10,994 --> 00:32:14,630
and if not for your father and...

489
00:32:14,765 --> 00:32:18,099
What he did for Oliver,

490
00:32:18,235 --> 00:32:22,104
your brother would never have
become the man that he was.

491
00:32:23,407 --> 00:32:26,375
I still can't believe Ollie's really gone.

492
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:28,511
I know, sweetheart.

493
00:32:33,066 --> 00:32:34,816
I'm sorry to intrude,

494
00:32:34,952 --> 00:32:37,819
but I wanted to meet you.

495
00:32:37,955 --> 00:32:39,955
- I'm...
- My sister.

496
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:41,890
Oliver told me a lot about you.

497
00:32:42,025 --> 00:32:43,859
I'm sorry that it took something like this

498
00:32:43,994 --> 00:32:45,393
for us to finally meet.

499
00:32:45,529 --> 00:32:50,065
Yes. Emiko, you are welcome here anytime.

500
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,767
Thank you.

501
00:32:54,538 --> 00:32:58,607
So you're from another Earth, is that it?

502
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:01,009
I know it's a lot to take in.

503
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:03,311
Well, I just found out there's
a reality where I was dead,

504
00:33:03,447 --> 00:33:06,648
so that's the curve I'm
grading on these days.

505
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:13,855
The Laurel of, well, this Earth...

506
00:33:13,991 --> 00:33:16,158
She was my wife.

507
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:20,763
So it must be strange seeing me.

508
00:33:21,705 --> 00:33:24,866
Yeah. Well, strange
enough to blow the curve...

509
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:28,870
But there's something nice about it, too.

510
00:33:36,346 --> 00:33:38,680
My condolences on your husband's passing.

511
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:41,483
I had our marriage erased.

512
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:43,419
Feelings cannot be erased.

513
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:45,420
I had no feelings for him.

514
00:33:45,555 --> 00:33:48,223
Our marriage was father's perverse joke,

515
00:33:48,358 --> 00:33:50,459
meant to torment me.

516
00:33:50,594 --> 00:33:54,830
Our father only ever meant for
you to have a normal life.

517
00:33:54,965 --> 00:33:56,832
I have lived a life far more normal

518
00:33:56,967 --> 00:34:00,168
than the one father designed for me.

519
00:34:00,303 --> 00:34:03,705
Hey. Thank you for coming.

520
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:05,874
There's nowhere else I'd be.

521
00:34:07,511 --> 00:34:10,779
Sara, this is my sister Talia.

522
00:34:10,914 --> 00:34:12,014
- Hi.
- Hello.

523
00:34:12,149 --> 00:34:14,149
Talia, this is Sara,

524
00:34:14,284 --> 00:34:16,084
my beloved.

525
00:34:18,121 --> 00:34:19,622
Hey, Dad.

526
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:29,565
Hi.

527
00:34:29,912 --> 00:34:31,567
Hi.

528
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:34,403
- I'm...
- I know.

529
00:34:34,538 --> 00:34:38,240
This morning, you were teething,

530
00:34:38,375 --> 00:34:41,810
and now you're... I mean, wow.

531
00:34:41,946 --> 00:34:46,248
Dad had a very similar
reaction when he first saw me.

532
00:34:47,818 --> 00:34:49,385
You met your father.

533
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,421
Yeah. He trained me.

534
00:34:53,557 --> 00:34:56,057
He taught me to be a hero,

535
00:34:56,193 --> 00:34:58,193
how to be like him.

536
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:01,563
I can tell you're a lot like him.

537
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:03,498
I can only hope.

538
00:35:12,542 --> 00:35:14,075
Felicity.

539
00:35:15,343 --> 00:35:16,442
Hey.

540
00:35:16,443 --> 00:35:18,847
I'm so sorry.

541
00:35:18,982 --> 00:35:20,949
- Thank you.
- He was a good man.

542
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:25,020
I was there at the end, and...

543
00:35:25,155 --> 00:35:26,755
Every day, I'm tortured with the thought

544
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:28,524
that I could have done more,

545
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:30,191
should have done more.

546
00:35:30,327 --> 00:35:34,730
No. You did everything
that you could, Barry.

547
00:35:34,865 --> 00:35:36,698
How could you know that?

548
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:38,967
Well, because, you know, I know you.

549
00:35:41,957 --> 00:35:43,237
I'm sorry.

550
00:35:45,312 --> 00:35:47,502
Hey. Hey.

551
00:35:47,503 --> 00:35:48,663
Hey.

552
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,916
Felicity.

553
00:35:55,052 --> 00:35:56,919
I'm so sorry.

554
00:35:57,054 --> 00:35:58,821
There is no body down there, no?

555
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:00,255
No.

556
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:02,958
We buried a casket full of mementos.

557
00:36:03,093 --> 00:36:05,661
Does anybody want to say a few words?

558
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:07,796
I'm barely keeping it together as it is.

559
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:09,597
I think that Oliver would have been worried

560
00:36:09,733 --> 00:36:13,402
that I'd say something
tactless anyway, so...

561
00:36:13,537 --> 00:36:16,672
- I don't know what to say.
- Yeah.

562
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:21,376
Words seem... meaningless.

563
00:36:23,046 --> 00:36:25,447
Hey.

564
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:30,685
Should be you.

565
00:36:40,063 --> 00:36:41,597
The Oliver that I met 8 years ago

566
00:36:41,732 --> 00:36:45,767
is not the one that we
say good-bye to today.

567
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:49,938
Oliver always told me that
in order to save his city,

568
00:36:50,073 --> 00:36:52,007
he had to become someone else,

569
00:36:52,142 --> 00:36:54,943
he had to become something else.

570
00:36:55,078 --> 00:36:57,278
I always thought that meant
becoming the Green Arrow,

571
00:36:57,414 --> 00:37:02,784
but... today, I realized
that meant becoming

572
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,253
a better man,

573
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:08,857
the best man he knew how to be,

574
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:14,262
and he took all of us
with him on that journey.

575
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:17,032
He changed everything.

576
00:37:17,167 --> 00:37:18,666
Oliver brought heroes into the world,

577
00:37:18,802 --> 00:37:20,135
he inspired heroes,

578
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:23,104
he inspired all of us here.

579
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:28,343
I was his brother,

580
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:33,115
and Oliver Queen was mine.

581
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:38,954
Of course, life will go on.

582
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:46,194
It always does,

583
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:50,398
but how, what twists and
turns it will take,

584
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:52,267
I can't say.

585
00:37:54,838 --> 00:37:56,838
I don't know what the future holds...

586
00:38:06,816 --> 00:38:09,450
Except to say to expect the unexpected.

587
00:38:19,848 --> 00:38:21,497
VOTE RAMIREZ 2020
THE FUTURE IS NOW

588
00:38:21,498 --> 00:38:24,232
Oliver may be gone,

589
00:38:24,367 --> 00:38:26,802
but his mission endures.

590
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,239
That mission lives on,

591
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:32,808
Oliver lives on

592
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:34,843
in the people he inspired.

593
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:40,816
Some will take that mission
to the rest of the world...

594
00:38:45,255 --> 00:38:47,024
Maybe even beyond that...

595
00:38:47,025 --> 00:38:48,148
OLIVER QUEEN
MEMORIAL DRIVE

596
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:59,501
because if the past 8 years
has shown us anything...

597
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:05,340
It's that this universe is

598
00:39:05,475 --> 00:39:10,913
far bigger than any of us
could have dared imagine...

599
00:39:16,386 --> 00:39:20,188
Even if it is a little less bright

600
00:39:20,323 --> 00:39:22,858
without him in it.

601
00:39:25,381 --> 00:39:27,325
OLIVER QUEEN
1985-2019

602
00:39:27,326 --> 00:39:30,110
BELOVED SON, BROTHER, HUSBAND, AND FATHER

603
00:39:30,111 --> 00:39:33,969
HERO OF STAR CITY
THE GREEN ARROW

604
00:39:37,407 --> 00:39:39,374
Where I'm taking you,

605
00:39:39,509 --> 00:39:40,842
there is no return.

606
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:45,113
I have waited a very long time to see him.

607
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:46,782
I'm ready.

608
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,888
Hi.

609
00:41:00,023 --> 00:41:02,323
Glad you could finally make it.

610
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:31,252
This is so nice.

611
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:32,720
Not to complain. I just thought

612
00:41:32,856 --> 00:41:36,346
that the afterlife would look
a little less like your old office.

613
00:41:37,194 --> 00:41:40,462
It's my mom's office.

614
00:41:40,597 --> 00:41:42,530
I wanted to be where I first saw you.

615
00:41:42,665 --> 00:41:47,169
Well, that would be in the I.T.
Department 7 floors down.

616
00:41:47,304 --> 00:41:48,669
You sure?

617
00:41:51,674 --> 00:41:53,942
You're cute.

618
00:41:54,077 --> 00:41:57,145
It's too bad you're, you know, dead,

619
00:41:57,281 --> 00:42:01,416
which is obviously a lot worse
for you than it is for me.

620
00:42:01,551 --> 00:42:03,084
It's a long story.

621
00:42:08,258 --> 00:42:10,158
Lucky for us...

622
00:42:12,762 --> 00:42:16,076
We have all the time in the world
for me to tell it to you.

623
00:42:28,949 --> 00:42:38,055
