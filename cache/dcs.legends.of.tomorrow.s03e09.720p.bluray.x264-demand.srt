1
00:00:01,752 --> 00:00:03,744
<i>Previously
on</i> Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:06,107
Thank you for notifying us
of Director Hunter's whereabouts.

3
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:08,168
Now the Legends
are free to fly the skies?

4
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:09,694
The Time Bureau
has bigger things to worry about

5
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:10,718
than a bunch of idiots.

6
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:12,668
Mallus is getting stronger,
Captain Lance.

7
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:15,881
<i>There is a war coming,
and history needs you to be ready.</i>

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,308
- Do I know you?
- No. No.

9
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:20,475
I'm Marty.

10
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,707
<i>So, you're Leonard Snart's
doppelganger?</i>

11
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:24,893
No, I'm Leonard Snart,
but you can call me Leo.

12
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:28,063
I'm asking you
to let me die

13
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:30,190
so that you may live.

14
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,624
This is the last store in town
with the Beebo dolls, Clarissa.

15
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:46,168
I promise I am not leaving
without one for Lily.

16
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:50,169
Professor Stein. Merry Christmas.

17
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:52,216
And a happy Hanukkah to you, Chuck.

18
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:54,590
Every kid needs a Beebo doll, right?

19
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:56,258
So it would seem.

20
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:59,056
I got one. I can't believe I got one!

21
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:04,808
I don't suppose you can tell me
how many Beebos you have back there.

22
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,230
Plenty. Don't worry about it.

23
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:08,137
That was our last one.

24
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,102
Actually, we just ran out of them.

25
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,358
- But you just said...
- I'm sorry, folks.

26
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,940
We are expecting
a new shipment in February.

27
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:17,493
February?

28
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:20,116
Five-year-olds
don't wait until February.

29
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,205
Wait!

30
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,940
There's one more Beebo right there!

31
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,204
Move!

32
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,329
Think, Marty.

33
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:37,845
Distance of about six meters,
allowing for air resistance.

34
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:40,218
Breathe in, hold...

35
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:01,494
- Eureka. I've got it!
<i>- Beebo loves you.</i>

36
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:03,909
Get him!

37
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,002
Barbarians!

38
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,507
Great Scott!

39
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:26,896
Barbarians?

40
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,694
Gideon said that you
wanted to see me.

41
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:45,117
Come in.

42
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:46,580
Have a seat.

43
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:51,248
You comfortable?

44
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,706
I know the Legends lost a friend.

45
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,211
I've been there.

46
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:59,131
I want to help you guys
through the grieving period.

47
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:01,213
Oh, that's very sweet of you.

48
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,790
I want to give you the chance
to get anything off your chest.

49
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,558
Anything at all.
What would you like to say...

50
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,477
To Professor Martin Stein?

51
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:18,522
I think that everyone
copes in their own ways.

52
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,608
It's clear the Legends
are ill-equipped to cope at all.

53
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,151
This way?

54
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,614
This is wrong.

55
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:27,141
Well, actually, there is one question
I never got to ask Marty.

56
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,165
Great.

57
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,957
When I reduce
the <i>Waverider's</i> coefficient

58
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,500
of sinusoidal depleneration,

59
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,870
it seems to inversely hyper-celerate.

60
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,840
Let's hear it again.

61
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,917
What would you like
to say to me, Nathaniel?

62
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:43,550
Still, a little too nasally.
Remember, you speak very precisely.

63
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,383
This is therapy.
Not acting class.

64
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,306
Nice. That's the right level
of frustration.

65
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,513
Very Stein.
Now just do it with the puppet.

66
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:56,142
My goodness, you're really
working out some rage issues

67
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,647
with Professor Stein.

68
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,695
No, I just hate puppets.

69
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:03,449
All right, I am
putting the puppet away.

70
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:05,743
I get it now.
It wasn't the best tactic.

71
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,740
Look, Jax,

72
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,559
I think that you, even more so
than the others,

73
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,040
must be in pain about this.

74
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:14,706
He died so I could live.
End of story.

75
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,253
It wasn't your fault.

76
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,581
I should never have given him
that Firestorm cure.

77
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:21,008
I should've been strong enough
for both of us...

78
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,210
Mmm.

79
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,923
No. We're not doing this.

80
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,353
What was that?

81
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,392
An anachronism caused
a disturbance in a temporal zone

82
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:35,769
which created a Timequake.

83
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,442
And this is where Marty
would've said, "Fascinating."

84
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,022
All right, everybody,
I know you're sad,

85
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,527
<i>so this is what we're gonna do.</i>

86
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:47,486
I want you to take
all of your feelings about Martin

87
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:51,994
and put it in a box, and then I
want you to close the box.

88
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,874
And then you're gonna lock the box.

89
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,201
Well, that sounds healthy.

90
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,249
Maybe not, but we got a job to do.

91
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:58,705
Gideon, the anachronism, please.

92
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,291
<i>A "Level 12"?</i>

93
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,171
<i>"Level 10" didn't do itjustice.</i>

94
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,091
<i>Leif Erikson's Vikings set up
a colony in the New World</i>

95
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:07,968
<i>around 1000 AD.</i>

96
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:13,053
Little known fact, the Vikings
"discovered" the Americas 492 years

97
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:16,810
before Columbus, but due to
Erikson's adoption of Christianity,

98
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,893
the Vikings decided
to pack up their bags and head home.

99
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,652
Sorry, Gideon, you were saying?

100
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,446
<i>In this version of history,
the Vikings stayed and conquered</i>

101
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:28,493
<i>all of North America
or as it's called now, New Valhalla.</i>

102
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:31,492
- Cool hat.
- How many beers is that?

103
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:32,913
It's not even noon yet.

104
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,116
You have a problem, Mickey.

105
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:38,044
I don't have a problem.
Now shut up.

106
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,745
All right. Let's go.

107
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,877
I don't think the Legends
are ready for the field.

108
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:46,132
Listen, Leo, kicking ass
is how we heal.

109
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,183
I don't like it, sister.

110
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,432
This land is bountiful,
but its people,

111
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,184
these Skraelings...

112
00:05:58,275 --> 00:05:59,641
They're skilled warriors.

113
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,146
We should not challenge them.

114
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:03,394
It's time to return home
to Greenland.

115
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:05,529
Brother, this continent is vast.

116
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:09,450
Who knows how far west it goes
and what riches it has to plunder?

117
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:13,492
It is our destiny to conquer
all of New Valhalla.

118
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,407
<i>That's Leif Erikson
and his sister Freydis.</i>

119
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,914
Now, this moment
has huge historical significance.

120
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:21,357
It determines whether or not
the Vikings leave North America

121
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,088
which for me is very exciting...

122
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,674
You okay, man?

123
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,839
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

124
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:29,504
Let's just stay on mission.

125
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:31,557
Okay.

126
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:34,680
The Christian monks
say that endless war

127
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,977
means our people
will never know peace.

128
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,430
It is what the Blue God
has demanded, brother.

129
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:42,441
The anachronism isn't a weapon.

130
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:45,361
<i>Uh, guys, we're dealing
with some kind of Blue God.</i>

131
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:46,608
Found him.

132
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:54,077
<i>Is that Martin?</i>

133
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,451
Martin's the anachronism.

134
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,828
They use his genius
to conquer the New World.

135
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,349
Hey, it's supposed to be
a stealth mission.

136
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,629
Damn it!

137
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,251
<i>Jax, get back into position. Now.</i>

138
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:13,556
Jefferson, what are you doing here?
I haven't seen you since...

139
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:14,849
1987.

140
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,018
Uh, don't worry, Martin.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

141
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,685
Wait! No, no, no, no!

142
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,404
- Hey, you all right?
- Most certainly not!

143
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,606
Look out!

144
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:35,445
I haven't had a bath or a change
of clothes for over a week.

145
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,738
I could've died.

146
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,709
- Was it something I said?
- No, nothing. It's fine.

147
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:45,191
We just gotta get out of here
before the rest of the clan comes.

148
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:46,501
No, no, no. Wait, wait.

149
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,378
- We have to go back.
- Go back for what?

150
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,175
- My Beebo.
- What the hell is a Beebo?

151
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,127
As in "cuddle me" Beebo?

152
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,968
It's a Hanukkah gift for Lily.

153
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,175
We're not going back
for some damn toy!

154
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,429
You don't understand!

155
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,183
That damn toy
is gonna change history!

156
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:03,981
The four-eyed man has escaped.

157
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:05,774
No matter.

158
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,520
We still have our god.

159
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,451
<i>Beebo hungry.</i>

160
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,618
And our God hungers for battle!

161
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:25,203
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

162
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,083
Beebo! Beebo!

163
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,835
Beebo! Beebo!

164
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,633
Beebo! Beebo! Beebo!

165
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,086
<i>Beebo! Beebo!</i>

166
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,536
All right, let me get this straight.

167
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,303
So the Vikings think
that Beebo is a god.

168
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:44,104
Beebo as in,
"Wow, wow, Beebo love you!"

169
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,933
As preposterous as it sounds,
that obnoxious toy

170
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,025
is the only reason I survived.

171
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:50,819
The Vikings who found me in the woods

172
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,897
were about to kill me
when Beebo spoke.

173
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:56,325
It was like a spell
was cast over the barbarians.

174
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,451
Here. This should warm you up.

175
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,076
- Earl Grey?
- With a little bit of brandy.

176
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,953
Oh. My favorite. Thank you, Jefferson.

177
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,204
<i>It does make sense.</i>

178
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,456
<i>Norse mythology is filled
with creatures like Beebo.</i>

179
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,037
Trolls, gnomes, tomtens...

180
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,167
Okay, sure.

181
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,920
But thinking he's a god who wants
them to conquer the New World?

182
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,797
You see, at first,
the Vikings thought

183
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,379
that only I could make Beebo talk.

184
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,840
But, it soon became clear
that my translations

185
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,300
were not what Leif's sister
wanted to hear.

186
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,637
Freydis usurped my position
and twisted Beebo's words

187
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:25,767
for her own agenda.

188
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:28,395
All right, sounds like
we gotta go get that Beebo,

189
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:29,851
and send the Vikings packing.

190
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,277
Zari, can you take young Stein
to get cleaned up?

191
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,363
Come on.

192
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,760
I could help him, it's just,
I've got nothing else...

193
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:38,197
- It's okay. Zari's got it.
- Hmm.

194
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,328
Mart... Marty. Martin.

195
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,577
You're looking young and lively.

196
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,745
- Good to see you.
- You too, Raymond.

197
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,047
One question. Where's me?

198
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,549
- Uh...
- At peace.

199
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,961
With your family
for the holidays.

200
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:58,591
Oh, I almost forgot!

201
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:00,093
Happy Hanukkah.

202
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:02,059
Happy Hanukkah.

203
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,893
I'll drink to that.

204
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:13,069
It's disgusting.
What's wrong with this beer?

205
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,320
<i>Man, can you believe Sara?</i>

206
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,405
She doesn't trust me
around young Stein.

207
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:20,332
So you're saying you weren't planning
on warning Martin about him dying?

208
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:24,034
Okay, fine. But, come on, man.

209
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,161
Grey dies, and then all of a sudden

210
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,038
his younger self
gets displaced in time?

211
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,189
Yeah, I know. It's crazy that we
keep bumping into ourselves.

212
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:31,249
Yeah.

213
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,080
I mean, Ray and the baby Dominator

214
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,006
and Sir Stein and his killer 'stache?

215
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:38,052
Mick's dad. I mean,
this can't just be a coincidence.

216
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:44,058
What if this is fate's way
of saying we should step up?

217
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,431
That we can actually improve things.

218
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:48,228
Martin made his choice, Jax.

219
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:51,644
We should be honoring his sacrifice,
not trying to undo it.

220
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,602
Yeah, but it's Grey.
I mean, how can we not tell him?

221
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,605
Because what if
knowing about his death

222
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:00,191
makes young Marty choose
not to create the Firestorm matrix?

223
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:02,151
Or meet you,
or step foot on the ship?

224
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,500
He never would've wanted you to risk
the present to save him in the past.

225
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,704
And how exactly do you know
what he would've wanted, Ray?

226
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,668
You weren't psychically
connected to him for three years.

227
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,882
Gideon! The beer
tastes like sewage water!

228
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,929
<i>Was that a question, Mr. Rory?</i>

229
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,382
Don't get smart, lady.

230
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,387
I adjusted the fabrication settings.

231
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,969
The <i>Waverider</i> is now a dry ship.

232
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:31,935
No alcohol allowed.

233
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,141
You son of a...

234
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,816
You said your drinking
wasn't a problem.

235
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:36,663
If you can go
a couple of days without booze,

236
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:38,024
you've proven your point.

237
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,948
"A couple of days"? Forty-two hours?

238
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,070
Forty eight.

239
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:47,826
So I checked the lunar calendar,
and today is Yuletide.

240
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,577
Oh. Like Christmas?

241
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,750
Well, before Christians rebranded it,

242
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,829
wreaths, trees, elves were all
Norse traditions first.

243
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:58,166
And tonight, Leif is throwing
a huge Yuletide feast.

244
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,717
Which is the perfect cover for us.

245
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,799
Oh. We could dress up as Norse gods

246
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,722
and order them
to head back to Greenland,

247
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,015
or face our wrath!

248
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:10,122
- Worst idea you've ever had.
- That's a terrible idea.

249
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,227
Mmm-hmm.

250
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:14,148
<i>Incoming transmission
from Agent Sharpe.</i>

251
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,101
Put her on.

252
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:21,902
Agent Sharpe,
it's been a while, thankfully.

253
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,948
<i>- Captain Lance.</i>
- Let me guess.

254
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:25,867
You saw that there's
a Level 12 anachronism

255
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:28,307
and you're calling to lecture me
on everything that we're doing wrong.

256
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:29,331
<i>No.</i>

257
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,161
<i>- Okay, yes.</i>
- Hmm.

258
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,743
<i>But, I also heard about Martin Stein</i>

259
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,498
<i>and I'm calling
to express my condolences.</i>

260
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:38,039
Well, thank you.

261
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:41,672
But, my team and I,
we have it under control.

262
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:45,004
<i>I hope so, because the Legends fixing
a Level 12 under normal circumstances</i>

263
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,964
<i>would be a Beebo Day miracle.</i>

264
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,226
Did you just say "Beebo Day"?

265
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,516
<i>December 25th, Beebo Day?</i>

266
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,563
<i>When families exchange gifts
and sing silly songs</i>

267
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:58,108
<i>and discover that they can
no longer live under the same roof?</i>

268
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,987
<i>Beebo Day is part
of the anachronism, isn't it?</i>

269
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:03,439
- Yeah.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

270
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:04,899
<i>Never felt right.</i>

271
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,151
<i>This anachronism
is cementing fast.</i>

272
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:09,908
And to be honest, my team is still
pretty raw from losing Stein.

273
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:13,116
We could use an outside perspective.

274
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,041
<i>- Are you asking for my help?</i>
- No.

275
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:17,540
Okay, yes.

276
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,418
All right.

277
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,008
What's the plan?

278
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,507
You ready to see
the Legends in action?

279
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,351
The goal is to do this peacefully,
without action.

280
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,331
There's a first time
for everything, I guess.

281
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,971
Hail, Leif, son of Erik.

282
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:37,689
I, Nathaniel Henryson.

283
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,892
Hail, Nathaniel, son of Henry.

284
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:41,648
<i>A Yuletide surprise.</i>

285
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:43,695
You sure this is wise, brother?

286
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:45,822
We know nothing
about these people.

287
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:48,909
We brought booze.

288
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:00,913
Tell me of your clan.

289
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,548
You certainly are
an odd collection.

290
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:06,547
We're from all over, but we
stick together the best we can.

291
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:10,343
Although recently,
we lost a brother.

292
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,549
Ah. That can be difficult.

293
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,181
I've lost far too many men
and women in my own clan.

294
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,354
It has made you soft, brother.

295
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,853
Let's not fight
in front of our guest, sister.

296
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:24,107
As far as strategy goes,
this would not be my first pick.

297
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,563
Why not?

298
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:29,149
They welcomed us in,
we get Beebo and we get out.

299
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,611
The Bureau has rules
about fraternizing with the locals.

300
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,196
And these costumes are ridiculous.

301
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,826
Nah, you look good.

302
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,499
- Give me that.
- No, no, no, no.

303
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,672
"No booze" means no booze, Mickey.

304
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:45,132
Stop calling me that.

305
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:48,131
You have 35 hours left.
Can you handle it?

306
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,429
Are you ready to admit
that you have a problem?

307
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:51,801
You're the problem.

308
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,025
Ah! There you are, you little bastard.

309
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:06,858
<i>Beebo thirsty.</i>

310
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,073
You dare to steal from our god?

311
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,620
He's not gonna drink it.

312
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:18,915
Our gods do not
tolerate such insolence.

313
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,831
Beebo will decide your fate.

314
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:33,951
Anyone have eyes on Beebo?

315
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:35,432
Short, blue, looking for cuddles?

316
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,971
Yeah. We're working on it.

317
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:38,854
Here we go.

318
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,648
By Odin's spear, you bested us!

319
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:49,529
Beautiful. And they can
hold their mead.

320
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:53,776
Tell us, which of these clansmen
are your husbands,

321
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:55,744
and we'll kill them.

322
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,200
Oh. I'm not really the husband kind.

323
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,041
Perfect. Me neither!

324
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:05,121
All right. You guys said if we won,
you'd take us to see your Blue God.

325
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,581
Two out of three!

326
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,418
<i>Fellow warriors.</i>

327
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,757
Our guest has been
stealing mead from the Blue God!

328
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:20,719
And now, our god
will render judgment.

329
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,430
Beebo! Beebo! Beebo!

330
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:31,364
Beebo! Beebo! Beebo!

331
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:33,156
Beebo! Beebo!

332
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,490
How judge you, Beebo?

333
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,245
<i>Beebo hungry.</i>

334
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:46,086
Our God demands justice!

335
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:47,792
To the pyre!

336
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:48,882
Yeah!

337
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:52,968
Nate and Amaya,
you're on Beebo.

338
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:55,797
<i>Everyone else, let's make sure Rory
doesn't get burned alive.</i>

339
00:16:56,933 --> 00:17:00,051
Freydis, it's Yuletide.
Let's not ruin it.

340
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:04,347
More wood. So bright Odin
can see it from Valhalla.

341
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,892
Is it weird
that I find her hot?

342
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,022
Weird, but then again,
not surprising.

343
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,238
Leo, can you
take care of the fire?

344
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:15,486
Copy that, Captain Lance.

345
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:17,679
I thought you said this was
an undercover operation.

346
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,320
Well, blowing your cover
is half the fun.

347
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,034
Into the flames!

348
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,373
Now.

349
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,089
It's a sign!

350
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,634
Beebo does not want
our clansman to be burned!

351
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:47,473
The Blue God has shown mercy.

352
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:52,687
<i>I love you.</i>

353
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:55,968
I accidentally squeezed him.

354
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:57,528
He's so damn huggable.

355
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,901
Unhand him or die!

356
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:14,750
I'm leaving myself wide open
and you can't land a single punch.

357
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:16,051
Yeah, I'm just warming up.

358
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,129
Let's up the stakes, then.

359
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,966
Loser takes the other's chores
for a month.

360
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,967
Deal.

361
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,949
I know what you're
trying to do, by the way.

362
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:28,514
What's that?

363
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:29,940
You're trying to distract me?

364
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,230
I'm also trying to beat you.

365
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,070
The distraction working?

366
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:36,855
I still want to warn Grey.

367
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,315
So do it.

368
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:40,776
I would've warned my brother
if I had the chance.

369
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,077
Yeah, but, Sara...

370
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:44,163
Just 'cause she's the captain
doesn't mean you have

371
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,322
to do everything she says.

372
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,123
Yeah, no, I know. But...

373
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,210
Ah. Jefferson. There you are.

374
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,371
Ah! Game over!

375
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,298
- Oh! Come on.
- I'm scary good at this.

376
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:56,545
You're just okay.

377
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:59,174
Forgive the interruption,
but I would very much

378
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,300
like to return
to my Clarissa and Lily.

379
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,258
With or without
that wretched Beebo.

380
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:06,514
Yeah, sure. I'll take you
in the Jumpship.

381
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:09,597
Yo!

382
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,101
<i>This is your chance.</i>

383
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:14,734
Find some loophole like I did
with Helen of Troy.

384
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:17,062
You could save your friend's life.

385
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:34,042
- Nathaniel!
<i>- Beebo likes to play.</i>

386
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,394
Nate, Nate! I'm open!

387
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:57,148
<i>Whee!</i>

388
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,314
<i>Whee!</i>

389
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:11,829
I hate puppets.

390
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:16,622
<i>Beebo want cuddle.</i>

391
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:33,226
I know how much you
wanted to believe, sister.

392
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,599
But Beebo's a false god.

393
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,771
Full of false promises.

394
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,899
We are Vikings.

395
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,777
This is our land to conquer.

396
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:44,400
It's time to go home.

397
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:46,910
And abandon this colony.

398
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:55,377
It seems the old gods
have abandoned us.

399
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:58,752
Well, looks like the Legends
have saved Odin Day.

400
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:00,214
Odin Day?

401
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:02,300
Well, you mean Christmas.

402
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,343
Doesn't ring a bell.

403
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:07,548
Oh, I thought we fixed
the anachronism.

404
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:16,890
My name is Odin.

405
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,146
Ruler of Asgard.

406
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:21,979
Damien Darhk.

407
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:23,279
<i>You know this guy.</i>

408
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,651
<i>And his daughter.</i>

409
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:28,110
See? I told you the Norse god
costumes would work.

410
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,574
Bow to the king of the true Gods.

411
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:34,123
<i>He has left Valhalla
to lead you into battle.</i>

412
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:37,665
Together, we will
conquer the New World.

413
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:40,501
Mick, no. We're outmatched.

414
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:42,091
Let's go.

415
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,045
Kneel before Odin, brother.

416
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:00,524
That was unexpected.

417
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:03,691
I mean, not the Darhks showing up.
They seem to enjoy altering history.

418
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:05,989
- You retreating.
- Well, Vikings are one thing.

419
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:07,135
If we're gonna
tangle with the Darhks,

420
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,428
we've got to get
our heads on straight.

421
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,785
I, for one, am glad
you're treading cautiously.

422
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,225
<i>We've arrived safely
in the temporal zone.</i>

423
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:14,581
<i>But I'm afraid the anachronism...</i>

424
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:16,784
Let me guess, it's worse.
Thank you, Gideon.

425
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:20,210
Another Timequake.

426
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,547
We are not letting America go Viking.

427
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,420
Ava, can you call
the Time Bureau for backup?

428
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,467
Wait, wait.
Are we really that desperate?

429
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:29,925
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

430
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,348
The last time we faced Nora Darhk,
she put Sara in a coma.

431
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,515
Right.

432
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:36,265
- I'll speak to Director Bennett.
- Thank you.

433
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:42,525
Wow. That's quite the getup.

434
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:43,977
Where's Martin and Jax?

435
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,903
Uh, they're on their way
back to Central City.

436
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,985
Gotta get Martin home
for the holidays.

437
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,128
You've been awfully quiet, Jefferson.

438
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:04,540
Uh, my bad.

439
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,465
I've just had some things on my mind.

440
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:12,931
<i>It's good to be home.</i>

441
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,925
I can't wait
to see Clarissa and Lily.

442
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:17,851
Listen.

443
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:21,272
This is going
to sound crazy, okay?

444
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:23,930
But, you need to open this letter

445
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,903
on November 28th, 2017.

446
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:28,946
I've seen <i>Back to the Future,</i>
Jefferson.

447
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:32,242
That mockery of time travel
that Clarissa adores.

448
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:35,362
I don't suppose this letter
has anything to do with my future.

449
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:36,992
This letter
could save your life.

450
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,449
Then I categorically
refuse to take it.

451
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,535
You know the dangers
of trying to improve history.

452
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:43,336
No, no. This is your future.

453
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,038
And your past.

454
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:46,460
Give me a little credit.

455
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,337
I know the team was lying
when they said

456
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,384
I was visiting family
for the holidays.

457
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:53,839
Then take the damn letter
and stop being so stubborn.

458
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,180
Think about your family.

459
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:02,264
This letter is a loophole.

460
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:06,064
Nothing changes
until November 28th, 2017.

461
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,401
Please.

462
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,366
Okay, Jefferson.

463
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:15,868
Thank you.

464
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:26,959
<i>Hello, friend.</i>

465
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:28,707
Looking for booze?

466
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:29,917
I'm not your friend.

467
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,751
<i>You almost died back there</i>

468
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,507
<i>and I know you're
craving a drink.</i>

469
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,589
That's why it's
so important to resist!

470
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:38,517
You have to stop numbing yourself
to fear and pain.

471
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:41,219
That's when
the true transformation begins!

472
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,429
Mickey!

473
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,601
You're right.

474
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:46,604
You're right. I apologize.

475
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,021
That was his name.

476
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:51,070
Your Earth-X Doppelganger
was my best friend.

477
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:54,274
We grew up together
in the resistance, and when he died,

478
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,819
I was devastated.

479
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,905
<i>Seeing you made me realize</i>

480
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:02,491
I was a long way
from acceptance.

481
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,918
I didn't come on board
just to help you process your loss,

482
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:09,039
I came so I could process mine.

483
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:14,966
Was that guttural sound
your response?

484
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,637
To what?

485
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:18,465
My heartfelt confession.

486
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:20,592
I don't care. I wasn't listening.

487
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:24,387
Well, the Mick Rory I knew did care.

488
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:26,143
And he did listen.

489
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:30,060
He was the kindest,
most selfless person I've ever met.

490
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:33,484
A far cry from the crude alcoholic

491
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:36,487
oafish waste of space before me.

492
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:38,739
I'm a disappointment?

493
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:42,197
The Leonard Snart that I knew
was a cold, ruthless criminal

494
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:44,283
who didn't say "Boo"
about my drinking

495
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,976
because he knew I could
get the job done.

496
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:48,457
I don't like you.
You don't fit in.

497
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:52,090
Why don't you go back
to that Nazi hellhole you call home?

498
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:54,634
If that's how you feel,
then I'll leave

499
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,715
as soon as we return from Vinland.

500
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:57,966
- Good.
- Good.

501
00:25:58,057 --> 00:25:59,468
- Good!
- Good!

502
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,101
<i>Are we clear, Agent Sharpe?</i>

503
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:05,850
Crystal, sir.

504
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:08,022
Please tell me you have good news.

505
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:11,379
I'm afraid Director Bennett
doesn't believe this mission

506
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,689
is the best use
of our resources.

507
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:16,447
So, what, the Time Bureau
is just gonna let the Darhks

508
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:18,195
run around and change history?

509
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,444
The Time Bureau
is in disarray.

510
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:23,951
Ever since Rip
was sentenced to prison...

511
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:26,124
Wait. Rip is in prison?

512
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:28,664
He was hardly convincing
at the tribunal,

513
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:30,962
raving about Mallus,
completely unapologetic.

514
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:34,416
And in his absence, Damien Darhk
has recruited even more allies.

515
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:37,760
Gideon, can you pull up what
Director Bennett showed me, please?

516
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,089
<i>Grodd survived Vietnam.</i>

517
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:43,300
<i>Darhk secured him
a means of time travel.</i>

518
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:44,759
Of course.

519
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:48,726
Darhk and his daughter
are just too powerful.

520
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:50,210
They have magic
that we don't understand.

521
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:52,396
We've lost scores of agents
trying to fight them.

522
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:54,231
So what? What does that mean?

523
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:55,961
That you're just gonna throw
in the towel?

524
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:58,109
We can't afford
to lose anyone else.

525
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:00,442
And I can?

526
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:01,617
No...

527
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:04,821
Do you have any idea
how hard this has been on us?

528
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:07,123
I really am sorry, Sara.

529
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:13,338
Director Bennett has ordered me
to return to the Time Bureau, so...

530
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:14,755
Screw his orders.

531
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:16,500
I need you here.

532
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,836
Look, I know Darhk
is personal for you.

533
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,890
And you're the last person
to back out of a fight,

534
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:24,219
but you asked me
to give you an outside perspective.

535
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:28,219
If you're concerned about the safety
of your team, leave Vinland.

536
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:30,179
This is not a fight
the Legends can win.

537
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:47,955
Hey. You rang?

538
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:52,247
Yes. Heard you took young Stein
back to 1992.

539
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,794
- Yep.
- How did it go?

540
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:55,830
He's just glad to be home.

541
00:27:57,885 --> 00:27:59,968
Okay. Here's the deal.

542
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:02,295
Backup is not coming.

543
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:05,223
The Time Bureau thinks
the Darhks can't be defeated.

544
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,178
And they're probably right.

545
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:10,596
Leo asked us
to talk about our feelings.

546
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:13,898
Well, my feeling is that history
needs us to stop the Darhks,

547
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:15,896
but after losing Stein,

548
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,191
I can't lose anyone else.

549
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:24,451
I need you guys to take
the <i>Waverider</i> and leave.

550
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:25,902
Not without you.

551
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:27,787
You can't face Darhk alone.

552
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,204
I have a plan.

553
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,377
I'm here to speak to Odin.

554
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:39,583
Let her pass.

555
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,511
My father will enjoy killing you.

556
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,803
<i>You've come alone.</i>

557
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:50,476
I'm here to make you an offer.

558
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:53,017
Oh, this ought to be good.

559
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:57,526
Oh.

560
00:28:57,611 --> 00:28:59,398
Leave now
and I'll let you live.

561
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:01,979
No.

562
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:03,489
Hold up.

563
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,199
Your plan sucks.

564
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,155
Pretty's right.

565
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:08,578
Well, I can't do nothing.

566
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:10,433
<i>Yeah, but you can
come up with a better plan</i>

567
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:11,914
that like, doesn't get you killed.

568
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,037
Okay, Z, what's your big plan?

569
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:18,379
Well, first of all, you don't
enter the longhouse by yourself.

570
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:22,591
My father will enjoy killing you.

571
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:25,511
<i>You've come alone.</i>

572
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:27,179
Not exactly.

573
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,939
And then Darhk will
have some sort of quip.

574
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,025
Something evil.

575
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,067
But not too mustache-twirly.

576
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,154
What, are you gonna huff and puff
until you blow my house in?

577
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:55,041
What's the matter?
Performance anxiety?

578
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:03,299
So far this works, but it
doesn't solve our Nora problem.

579
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:05,009
And what about the rest
of the Vikings?

580
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:06,966
Odin is under attack!

581
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,048
Defend him if you
want to see Valhalla!

582
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,933
<i>You're gonna need backup.</i>

583
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:14,973
Listen, Sara.

584
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:17,555
Just don't let Grey's death
teach us the wrong lessons.

585
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,854
Either we do this together
or not at all.

586
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:25,154
Gideon, plot a course to Vinland.

587
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:42,289
What, are you gonna huff and puff
until you blow my house in?

588
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:48,548
What's the matter?
Performance anxiety?

589
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:58,558
Odin is under attack!

590
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,686
Defend him
if you want to see Valhalla.

591
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:09,691
<i>It is I, Beebo,
risen from the grave.</i>

592
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:11,654
Like Christ himself.

593
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:16,990
Yes. Jesus is the one true God.

594
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:20,794
<i>But it doesn't mean science
or evolution isn't real.</i>

595
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:24,214
<i>Anyway, you need
to return to Greenland,</i>

596
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:28,088
<i>hmm, which will soon be melting,
thanks to global warming.</i>

597
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:29,544
<i>Which is also real.</i>

598
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:36,892
Like a little fire?

599
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:38,970
How about a little ice?

600
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:58,249
Nora.

601
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,200
They killed the Valkyrie!

602
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:17,050
Nora!

603
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:30,818
Not this time.

604
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:38,947
<i>Sara Lance.</i>

605
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:41,709
Who's there?

606
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:43,294
Who are you?

607
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,704
What is this place?

608
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,962
<i>I am Mallus.</i>

609
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:54,587
<i>Soon I will be free.</i>

610
00:32:55,307 --> 00:33:01,144
<i>And your world
will know unendurable pain.</i>

611
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:13,235
- You came back.
- It's like you said.

612
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:14,492
You needed me.

613
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,243
Well, your timing is impeccable.

614
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:19,449
It's a Christmas miracle.

615
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:22,702
Yes.

616
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:32,653
<i>There is nothing
physically ailing you, Captain Lance.</i>

617
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,259
Told you, I'm fine.

618
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:37,343
You also told me
you visited an alternate dimension.

619
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,556
Well, it wasn't my first time.

620
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:40,929
Sara.

621
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,348
Tell me exactly
what you saw in there.

622
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,308
I don't know, okay?

623
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:49,017
It wasn't about what I saw,
it was about what I felt.

624
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:53,901
It was an absence of feeling,
no warmth, no love.

625
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,526
Just a void.

626
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:58,075
And the only thing
filling the void was...

627
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:01,032
Mallus.

628
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:06,284
It seems Rip was right
to be obsessed with him.

629
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:07,835
I need to tell the Bureau.

630
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:10,664
Aren't you afraid of getting
in trouble for disobeying orders?

631
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:12,502
It was worth it.

632
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:15,717
I'll see you again.

633
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:23,385
Gideon, how's the old timeline?

634
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:25,891
<i>Records show
that history has been restored.</i>

635
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:28,143
<i>New Valhalla
is North America again.</i>

636
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:30,270
<i>And the only war Beebo has incited</i>

637
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,067
<i>is in shopping malls
across the nation.</i>

638
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:35,442
Sounds like our work here is done.

639
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:38,817
Gideon, you're sure there are
no other changes to the timeline?

640
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,118
<i>If you're referring
to Professor Stein,</i>

641
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:43,161
<i>he still died in 2017.</i>

642
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:44,997
I'm sorry, Jax.

643
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:47,791
I just don't understand.

644
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:49,146
The loophole, it should've worked.

645
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:52,208
That letter told him exactly how to
protect himself on the day he died.

646
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:53,299
What happened?

647
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,917
He must not have read it.

648
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,889
Oh! Hey, Lily.

649
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:13,351
A little birdy told me you
wanted one of these guys.

650
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:16,438
- Beebo! I love him.
- Happy Hanukkah.

651
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:19,360
Clarissa, you remember Jefferson?

652
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:21,534
You haven't aged a day.

653
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,906
Neither have you.

654
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:24,407
Can I get you some Earl Grey?

655
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:26,655
Uh, yeah, sure.

656
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:28,620
Come on.

657
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:31,126
I think I know
why you're here. Come in.

658
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,007
The letter, you never read it.

659
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:38,834
That's because I already burned it.

660
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:40,089
What?

661
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:44,550
I was tempted, to be sure.
I thought a lot about that date.

662
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:47,302
November 28th, 2017?

663
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:49,637
I'll be 67 then.

664
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:51,848
I'll have had adventures.

665
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:54,229
Watched my daughter grow up.

666
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,777
And I'll have made a friend

667
00:35:57,155 --> 00:36:00,239
who is willing to risk far,
far too much for me.

668
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,033
I'm trying to save you.

669
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,031
You need to let me go.

670
00:36:05,622 --> 00:36:07,579
We both know
you shouldn't be here.

671
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:11,037
I may have a life
ahead of me, but to you,

672
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:13,209
I'm a ghost.

673
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:14,755
No, to me...

674
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:17,331
I'm not gonna cheat death, Jefferson.

675
00:36:18,385 --> 00:36:19,842
None of us live forever.

676
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:24,551
And yet I clearly live
a wonderful life with many chapters.

677
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:29,557
And if I had one wish, it wouldn't
be for me to prolong my life,

678
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:31,729
it would be for you

679
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,265
to live yours

680
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:37,769
and to have
all the happiness you deserve.

681
00:36:41,825 --> 00:36:43,066
Okay.

682
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,371
Goodbye, Grey.

683
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:52,120
Goodbye, Jefferson.

684
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:08,682
Did you try to change his fate?

685
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:11,928
It didn't work, so, uh...

686
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:15,143
I'm sorry, Jax.

687
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:16,732
Me too.

688
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:23,694
If I stay on this ship,
I'll never be able to move on.

689
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:25,983
What do you mean?

690
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,323
You want to leave?

691
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,407
You can't leave, Jax.

692
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:36,330
No, you're not leaving.
You're a part of this team.

693
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:38,504
And I always will be.

694
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:41,253
But, right now,
this is something I gotta do.

695
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:44,672
I need a different kind of adventure.

696
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,637
Is this what you really want?

697
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:50,053
Yeah.

698
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:52,263
I would order you to stay,

699
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:55,687
but I know you'd just disobey me

700
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:57,731
and follow your heart
like you always do.

701
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:00,146
Hey.

702
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:05,485
Can you do me a favor?

703
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:08,734
Don't tell the others
until I'm gone.

704
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:11,536
I don't do goodbyes.
It's not my thing.

705
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,123
Yeah, yeah.

706
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:14,619
Totally. I get it.

707
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:16,871
Okay.

708
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,942
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

709
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:51,869
You didn't really think we were
just gonna let you sneak out

710
00:38:51,955 --> 00:38:53,321
of here without saying goodbye.

711
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,683
Yeah, you can't
celebrate the holidays

712
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:55,993
without the whole family.

713
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:57,165
<i>Happy Yuletide!</i>

714
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:04,215
Well, I think we made
an impressive team out there.

715
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,672
It reminded me of old times.

716
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,048
Hmm.

717
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:14,893
Mmm.

718
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:17,061
As you can taste,
I reprogrammed Gideon.

719
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,597
I should not have
tried to change you.

720
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:20,727
I'm sorry, Mick.

721
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,310
To the ones we lost.

722
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:26,320
Or left behind.

723
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,320
- Speech!
- Speech!

724
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:33,528
Speech, speech, speech!

725
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:34,953
Okay, all right.

726
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,454
Uh...

727
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:40,501
When Grey first dragged me
onboard this ship,

728
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:43,204
I thought it was the last place
that I wanted to be.

729
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:45,505
I mean, you were all
a bunch of screw-ups,

730
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:48,630
B-list superheroes,
washed-up bank robbers.

731
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,757
- No offense.
- It's true.

732
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:53,339
But, the thing is,

733
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,595
when you get a bunch of broken pieces

734
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:57,405
and you put them
all together the right way,

735
00:39:57,896 --> 00:39:59,182
<i>they make something new.</i>

736
00:39:59,606 --> 00:40:02,815
And suddenly, they don't
feel so broken anymore.

737
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:07,231
And I'm pretty sure
that's what a family is.

738
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:09,442
So, uh...

739
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:11,573
I don't know what happens next,

740
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,943
but I know I'll always
have a family here.

741
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:15,323
With you guys.

742
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,932
- That's right.
- You're right, little brother.

743
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:18,197
Always.

744
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:22,663
Cheers.

745
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:37,971
Well, it's been an honor, Captain.

746
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,096
Come here.

747
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:43,598
Hey.

748
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,434
I'm sure it's only
gonna be a matter of time

749
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:51,772
before some Aztecs with jetpacks
invade Central City, so...

750
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:56,368
Then the honor's been all mine.

751
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,562
It's been a long time, love.

752
00:41:29,112 --> 00:41:30,112
John?

753
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:34,190
Now, let's see.

754
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:36,859
The last time we met,

755
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:38,948
I saved your soul.

756
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:42,076
Now there's something
you can do for me.

757
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,206
Look, I'd love to help,
but your timing is terrible.

758
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:45,743
But this won't take long, you see.

759
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:47,828
There's a demon out there.

760
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,456
It's possessing a little girl.

761
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:52,758
That demon,

762
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:54,843
he knows your name.

763
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,412
<i>Beebo loves you.</i>
