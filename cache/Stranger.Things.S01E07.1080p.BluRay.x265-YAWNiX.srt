1
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:11,960
That's better.

2
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:21,261
You don't need it.

3
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,518
Still pretty?

4
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:27,396
Yeah!

5
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:29,352
Pretty. Really pretty.

6
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:36,692
El?

7
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:38,987
Yes?

8
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:43,249
Um, I'm happy you're home.

9
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:45,827
Me, too.

10
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,960
Guys!

11
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,670
It's Lucas,
I think he's in trouble.

12
00:00:57,683 --> 00:00:59,549
Do you remember how he said
he was looking for the gate?

13
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:01,225
- Yeah.
- What if he found it?

14
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,350
What's he saying?

15
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,477
I don't know, he's way out of range.

16
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,525
<i>...son of a bitch!</i>

17
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:12,729
Lucas, if you can hear us, slow down.
We can't understand you.

18
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:15,406
Yes, I copy!
Do you?

19
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,233
They know about Eleven!

20
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,364
Get out of there!
They know about Eleven!

21
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,946
The bad men are coming!
All of them!

22
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,703
Do you hear me?
The bad men are coming!

23
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,455
"Mad hen."
Does that mean anything to you?

24
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:27,877
Like a code name or something?

25
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:30,421
<i>- The bad men are coming!
- "Bad men."</i>

26
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,123
Bad men!

27
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:34,129
Stay here.

28
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:44,723
What's that guy doing?

29
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,725
You don't think...

30
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:50,980
Well, I know she and Steve
have been spending some time together,

31
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,230
- so I thought maybe...
- Mom!

32
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:54,108
Well, is he home?

33
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,233
- Maybe you could ask him?
- Mom!

34
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:56,610
I'm sorry,
can you just hold on please?

35
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,817
Michael, I'm on the phone.
I've told you a million times...

36
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,822
- Did you schedule any repairs?
- What?

37
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:03,575
Is there anyone supposed to come
and do repairs on the house?

38
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,292
I don't understand.
Is there something wrong...

39
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,627
- No, Mom, nothing's wrong in the house.
- Mike!

40
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,678
- One second.
- Mike!

41
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:23,679
We need to leave...
right now.

42
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,724
Michael!

43
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:31,600
If anyone asks where I am,
I've left the country.

44
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:32,774
What?

45
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,503
Go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go!

46
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,352
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

47
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,809
<i>- Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Dustin!</i>

48
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,769
<i>Dustin, do you copy?</i>

49
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,695
Yeah, Lucas, they're on us.

50
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,398
<i>- Where are you?
- Cornwallis.</i>

51
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:21,778
<i>Meet me at Elm and Cherry!</i>

52
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,484
Copy. Elm and Cherry!

53
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:24,785
Okay.

54
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:34,208
- Shit!
- This way, come on!

55
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,585
Out of the way!

56
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:42,295
Out of the way!

57
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,012
- Lucas!
- Where are they?

58
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:52,392
- I don't know.
- I think we lost them.

59
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,940
Go, go, go, go, go!

60
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:59,108
Go, go, go, go, go!

61
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,530
- Faster, faster!
- Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

62
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,124
Holy... holy shit!

63
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:56,578
Did... did you see
what she did to that van?

64
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:57,752
No, Dustin, we missed it.

65
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,331
- I mean that was...
- Awesome.

66
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,089
It was awesome.

67
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,812
Everything I said
about you being a traitor and stuff...

68
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,518
I was wrong.

69
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,353
I'm sorry.

70
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,071
Friends...

71
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,865
friends don't lie.

72
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,082
I'm sorry, too.

73
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:37,622
Me, too.

74
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,130
Hey.

75
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,678
Jonathan?
Jesus, what... what happened?

76
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:12,926
- Ma'am...
- I'm fine.

77
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:14,473
Why is he wearing handcuffs?

78
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,676
Well, your boy assaulted a police officer.
That's why.

79
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,057
- Take them off.
- I am afraid I cannot do that.

80
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,230
- Take them off!
- You heard her. Take 'em off.

81
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:26,778
Chief, I get everyone's emotional here,
but there's something you need to see.

82
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:34,784
What is this?

83
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,453
Why don't you ask your son?
We found it in his car.

84
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,155
- What?
- Why are you going through my car?

85
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,036
Is that really the question
you should be asking right now?

86
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,205
I wanna see you in my office.

87
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,627
You won't believe me.

88
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,707
Why don't you give me a try?

89
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,502
Mike? Mike?

90
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:14,818
Yeah, just a minute, please!

91
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,579
Jiminy Christmas.

92
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,956
Hold your horses.

93
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:25,999
Mr. Wheeler?

94
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,705
Yes?

95
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:11,541
<i>I don't understand.</i>

96
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,001
You think my son is hiding this girl?

97
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,211
What happened to her hair?

98
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,843
We just need to know
if you've seen her in the past week.

99
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:21,141
- No, no.
- Absolutely not.

100
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,968
Our son with a girl?

101
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,305
I mean, believe me,

102
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,732
if he had a girl sleeping in this house,
we'd know about it.

103
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,400
Wouldn't we?

104
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,312
This girl...

105
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,442
what has she done?

106
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,273
I'm afraid I can't answer that.

107
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,653
Oh, my God, is she Russian?

108
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:40,862
- You can't treat us like this.
- I need you to stay calm.

109
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,662
You come into my house,

110
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,241
and you tell me that my son
is hiding some girl,

111
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:48,453
and that he's in danger,
but you can't tell us why?

112
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:51,380
And you, what,
you expect me to remain, what, calm?

113
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,098
I understand how upsetting this is.

114
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,348
I wish we could tell you more...

115
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:14,733
but I can tell you that your son,
Michael, is in real danger.

116
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,649
We want to help him.

117
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:21,531
We will help him.
I give you my word.

118
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,490
But in order for me to do that...

119
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,914
you have to trust me.

120
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,043
Will you trust me?

121
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,007
Good.

122
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:41,259
Now...

123
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,642
do you have any idea
where your son might have gone?

124
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:52,976
This is Randolph Road, right here.

125
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:56,608
The fence starts here,
and goes all the way around.

126
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:59,649
And this is the lab right here.

127
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,199
The gate's gotta be in there somewhere.

128
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:02,322
It's gotta be.

129
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,278
Well, who owns Hawkins Lab?

130
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,783
The sign says "Department of Energy."

131
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,991
Department of Energy?
What do you think that means?

132
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,041
It means government. Military.

133
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:12,290
- Then why does it say "Energy"?
- Just trust me, all right?

134
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,837
It's military. My dad's told me before.

135
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,664
Mike's right. There's soldiers out front.

136
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,795
Do they make, like,
lightbulbs or something?

137
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,093
No, weapons...

138
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,670
to fight the Russians,
and commies and stuff.

139
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,299
Weapons.

140
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,761
Oh, Jesus, this is bad.

141
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:28,686
Really bad.
The place is like a fortress.

142
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:29,761
Well, what do we do?

143
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,518
I don't know,
but we can't go home.

144
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,019
We're fugitives now.

145
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:36,727
Guys?

146
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,567
Do you hear that?

147
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,033
- Go, go, go, go!
- Come on, come on!

148
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,785
- It's stuck.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!

149
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,116
- Hurry up! Hurry, come on!
- Come on!

150
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,621
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

151
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,496
Get down!

152
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,254
Mental.

153
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:12,187
You say blood draws this thing?

154
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,605
We don't know.

155
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:15,857
It's just a theory.

156
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,155
<i>I'm sorry, Mom.</i>

157
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:24,234
What, you're sorry?
You're... you're sorry?

158
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:26,114
- That is not good enough, Jonathan.
- I know.

159
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:28,617
That's not even close. That's not even
in the... in the ballpark.

160
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,288
I wanted to tell you, I just...

161
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,617
What if this thing took you, too?

162
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,999
You risked your life... and Nancy's.

163
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:39,548
I thought I could save Will...
I still do.

164
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:42,001
This is not yours to fix alone.

165
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:46,931
You act like you're all alone
out there in the world, but you're not.

166
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,132
You're not alone.

167
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:49,592
I know.

168
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,143
God damn it, Jonathan.

169
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:53,892
- I know.
- Damn it.

170
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:57,979
I want an apology!

171
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,230
An apology for what, exactly?

172
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,061
Where is the chief?
I want to speak to him

173
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,487
- right this instant.
- Stay here.

174
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,405
Ma'am, I need you to calm down.

175
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:05,653
What is your name, Deputy?

176
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,530
Well, I'm an officer...
okay?

177
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,077
Name and badge number,
both of you!

178
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,029
- What the hell is going on here?
- Chief...

179
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,081
These men are humiliating my son.

180
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,159
- No, no, no. Okay, that's not true.
- Yes.

181
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,619
There was some kind of fight, Chief...

182
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:19,376
A psychotic child broke his arm!

183
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,708
- A little girl, Chief. A little one.
- That tone! Do you hear that tone?

184
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,043
Honestly,
I'm just trying to state a fact.

185
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,548
- I don't have time for this.
- It was a little girl...

186
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,221
Will you please take a statement...
and get her out?

187
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,469
- Yes.
- So what's this girl look like?

188
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:32,768
She had no hair
and she was bleeding from her nose.

189
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:34,720
Like a freak.

190
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:35,930
What'd you just say?

191
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,140
I said she's a freak!

192
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:41,022
No, her hair.
What'd you say about her hair?

193
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:43,024
Her head's shaved.

194
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:44,855
She doesn't even look like a girl.

195
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:47,274
And...

196
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:49,117
And what?

197
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:52,196
Tell the man, Troy.

198
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,866
She can...

199
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,415
do things.

200
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,792
What kind of things?

201
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:02,919
Like...

202
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:06,339
make you fly.

203
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:10,639
And piss yourself.

204
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:11,715
What?

205
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:14,347
Was she alone?

206
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,604
She always hangs out with those losers.

207
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,851
"Losers"?

208
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:21,483
What losers?

209
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:26,655
Hey.

210
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,275
You owe me $1.20.

211
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,412
Don't worry, he'll need more than aspirin
when we're done with him.

212
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:36,161
Yeah, if the creep ever gets out.

213
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,832
The cops should just lock him up forever.

214
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:40,502
Did you see the look on his face?

215
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,420
Oh.

216
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:44,840
He probably had that same look
whenever he killed his brother, right?

217
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:49,421
Oh, God, I just got an image
of him making that face

218
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:50,846
while he and Nancy are screwing.

219
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:52,764
Carol, for once in your life,
shut your damn mouth!

220
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,558
- What?
- Hey, what's your problem, man?

221
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,975
You're both assholes.
That's my problem.

222
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,397
- Are you serious right now, man?
- Yeah, I'm serious.

223
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:01,473
You shouldn't have done that.

224
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,853
- Done what?
- You know what.

225
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:04,810
You mean call her out
for what she really is?

226
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,146
Oh, that's funny, because I don't remember
you asking me to stop.

227
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,902
I should've put that spray paint
right down your throat.

228
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,607
- What the hell, Steve?
- You know,

229
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,784
neither of you ever cared about her.
You never even liked her,

230
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,532
because she's not miserable like you two.

231
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,033
She actually cares about other people.

232
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:17,365
The slut with a heart of gold.

233
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,665
I told you to watch your mouth!

234
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,038
Hey! I don't know
what's gotten into you, man,

235
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,416
- but you don't talk to her that way.
- Get out of my face.

236
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:24,997
Or what?

237
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,172
Or what?

238
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,841
You gonna fight me now, too? Huh?

239
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,008
You gonna fight me now, too?

240
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,382
Because you couldn't take
Jonathan Byers...

241
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,224
so I wouldn't recommend that.

242
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,392
Here, let me get the door for you, buddy.

243
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:47,273
That's right.
Run away, Stevie boy!

244
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,855
Run away!
Just like you always do.

245
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:53,283
That Nancy's turning you
into a little pussy!

246
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,661
That's right, Harrington, run away!

247
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:59,364
Run away!

248
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,546
I have to go home.

249
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,127
No, you can't.

250
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,973
- My mom... my dad are there.
- They're gonna be okay.

251
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,555
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Let go.

252
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,227
- Let go!
- Hey! Listen to me. Listen to me.

253
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:22,771
The last thing in the world we need

254
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:24,564
is them knowing
you're mixed up in all this.

255
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,188
- Mike is over there...
- They haven't found him.

256
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:28,564
Not yet, at least.

257
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,902
- For Mike?
- Come on, get in the car.

258
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,365
Look, we need to find them
before they do.

259
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:39,788
Do you have any idea
where he might have gone?

260
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:42,662
- No, I don't.
- I need you to think.

261
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,459
I don't know.
We haven't talked a lot.

262
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,377
I mean, lately...

263
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:47,625
Look, is there any place that your...

264
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,672
your parents don't know
about that he might go?

265
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,876
- I don't know.
- I might.

266
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,050
What?

267
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:57,131
I don't know where he is,
but I think I know how to ask him.

268
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,603
Whoa.

269
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:16,695
I got it.

270
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:28,249
<i>Mike,
are you there? Mike?</i>

271
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:29,671
You guys hear that?

272
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,874
<i>Mike, it's me, Nancy.</i>

273
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,635
<i>Mike, are you there?</i>

274
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,383
<i>Answer.</i>

275
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,135
<i>Mike, we need you to answer.</i>

276
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:40,761
Is that your sister?

277
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,390
This is an emergency, Mike.

278
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,766
Do you copy?

279
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,435
Mike, do you copy?

280
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:50,062
Okay, this is really weird.

281
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,643
Don't answer.

282
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,820
- She said it was an emergency.
- What if it's a trick?

283
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,649
- It's your sister!
- What if the bad people kidnapped her?

284
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,610
<i>- What if they're forcing her to say this?
- I need you to answer.</i>

285
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:02,242
It's like Lando Calrissian.
Don't answer.

286
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,072
<i>We need to know
that you're there, Mike.</i>

287
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,626
Listen, kid, this is the chief.
If you're there, pick up.

288
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,704
We know you're in trouble
and we know about the girl.

289
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,834
Why is she with the chief?

290
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,210
How the hell does he know about...

291
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:17,215
<i>We can protect you,
we can help you, but you gotta pick up.</i>

292
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:19,922
<i>Are you there?
Do you copy? Over.</i>

293
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,851
Anybody got any other ideas?

294
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:31,934
<i>Yeah, I copy.</i>

295
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:34,982
<i>It's Mike.</i>

296
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,404
I'm here.

297
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,025
We're here.

298
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,161
Need a hand?

299
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,414
Did you have something
to do with this?

300
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:56,587
I just...

301
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:58,756
I wanna help.

302
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,478
All yours.

303
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:25,071
They expect us
to just sit here like prisoners.

304
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,780
We should be out there looking for him.

305
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,662
Honey, we have to trust them, okay?

306
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:32,540
This is our government.
They're on our side.

307
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:36,540
That man gives me the creeps.

308
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,256
Nancy.

309
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,804
You don't think
she's involved in this, too, do you?

310
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,301
Nancy with Mike?

311
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:45,849
No.

312
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,931
No.

313
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,781
Will you stop pacing?

314
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,824
It's been way too long.

315
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,824
Do you know what? Maybe you're right.
Maybe this is all a trap

316
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,621
and the bad men
are coming to get us right now!

317
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:09,698
It's not a trap.

318
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,784
Why would the chief set us up?

319
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,039
Nancy, maybe, but the chief?

320
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,496
Lando Calrissian.

321
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,251
Would you shut up about Lando?

322
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,253
I don't feel good about this.
I don't feel good about this!

323
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,175
When do you feel good
about anything?

324
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,226
Shit!

325
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:35,648
Go, go, go, go.

326
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,610
Lando.

327
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:41,438
You think they saw us?

328
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:43,194
Both of you, shut up.

329
00:20:43,218 --> 00:20:45,218
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

330
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:29,445
Hey!

331
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:32,247
What the...

332
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:39,914
All right, let's go.

333
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:43,250
Let's go!

334
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,783
Mike. Oh, my God. Mike!

335
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:14,660
I was so worried about you.

336
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,163
Yeah, uh... me, too.

337
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,882
Is that my dress?

338
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:30,552
Okay, so, in this example,
we're the acrobat.

339
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:33,554
Will and Barbara, and that monster,
they're this flea.

340
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:36,057
And this is the Upside Down,
where Will is hiding.

341
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:39,560
Mr. Clarke said the only way to get there
is through a rip of time and space.

342
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,232
- A gate.
- That we tracked to Hawkins Lab.

343
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,604
With our compasses.

344
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:47,815
Okay, so the gate
has a really strong electromagnetic field,

345
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,116
and that can change
the directions of a compass needle.

346
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,409
Is this gate underground?

347
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,157
Yes.

348
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,239
Near a large water tank?

349
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:58,120
Yes.

350
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:00,460
How do you know all that?

351
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,626
He's seen it.

352
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:05,548
Is there any way that you could...

353
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:09,302
that you could reach Will?
That you could talk to him in this...

354
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:10,469
The Upside Down.

355
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,172
Down. Yeah.

356
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:14,967
And my friend Barbara?

357
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,551
Can you find her, too?

358
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:53,842
I'm sorry.

359
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:54,969
What?

360
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:57,221
What's wrong?
What happened?

361
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:59,928
I can't find them.

362
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,717
<i>Whenever she uses her powers,
she gets weak.</i>

363
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:38,346
The more energy she uses,
the more tired she gets.

364
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:41,052
- Like, she flipped the van earlier.
- It was awesome.

365
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,388
- But she's drained.
- Like a bad battery.

366
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,350
Well...
How do we make her better?

367
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:49,277
We don't.
We just have to wait and try again.

368
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:51,195
Well, how long?

369
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,647
I don't know.

370
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:53,982
The bath.

371
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:55,317
What?

372
00:24:57,955 --> 00:24:59,617
I can find them.

373
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:02,161
In the bath.

374
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:08,542
Oh!

375
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:12,960
Oh. Oh, my...
No, mmm-mmm.

376
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:15,045
Hey, you know how they did that?
You know what that is?

377
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:16,380
No, what?

378
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:19,011
Melted plastic
and microwaved bubble gum.

379
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:21,013
No way. Really?

380
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:22,639
Really.

381
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:27,061
- What in the world?
- Do you want me to pause it?

382
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:28,733
I'm sure it's just a wrong number.

383
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:32,733
Hello?

384
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:34,610
Mr. Clarke? It's Dustin.

385
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,568
Dustin? Is everything okay?

386
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,277
Yeah, yeah. I just, I...

387
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,454
I have a science question.

388
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,908
It's ten o'clock on Saturday.
Why don't we pick this up...

389
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:47,961
Do you know anything
about sensory deprivation tanks?

390
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:49,834
Specifically how to build one?

391
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:52,882
Sensory deprivation?
What is this for?

392
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:55,176
Fun.

393
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,924
Okay. Well...

394
00:25:57,848 --> 00:26:00,181
Why don't we talk about it Monday?
After school, okay?

395
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,759
<i>You always say
we should never stop being curious.</i>

396
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:04,719
To always open any curiosity door we find.

397
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:05,849
Dustin...

398
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:08,556
Why are you keeping
this curiosity door locked?

399
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:12,402
Uh-huh.

400
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:17,444
Uh-huh. How much?

401
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:19,404
Uh-huh.

402
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:23,492
Yep, all right.
Yeah, we'll be careful.

403
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,198
Definitely.
All right, Mr. Clarke.

404
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:27,500
Yeah, I'll see you on Monday.
I'll see you on Monday, Mr. Clarke.

405
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:28,952
Bye.

406
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:31,333
Do you still have that kiddie pool
we bobbed for apples in?

407
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,710
- I think so. Yeah.
- Yeah.

408
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:35,463
Good. Then we just need salt.
Lots of it.

409
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,259
How much is "lots"?

410
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:40,429
1,500 pounds.

411
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,224
Well, where are we gonna
get that much salt?

412
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,316
Hey, wait.

413
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,366
It's not gonna snow next week, is it?

414
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,536
Worst case, no school.

415
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,330
Even if we find Will in there...

416
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,952
what are we gonna do about that thing?

417
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,329
We're not gonna do anything.

418
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:10,830
I don't want you
anywhere near this, all right?

419
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:13,334
- Your mom's been through enough already.
- He's my brother.

420
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:16,757
Listen to me.
I'm gonna find him. All right?

421
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:18,380
You gotta trust me on this.

422
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,177
I am going to find him.

423
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,682
This damn thing is heavy.

424
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:36,644
Come on.
It's upside down.

425
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:37,979
No, this way.

426
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:42,029
- Okay, um...
- How does this even work?

427
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:44,611
- Try that side.
- Son of a bitch!

428
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:46,697
- Pull it back. Pull it back.
- I am!

429
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,407
One, two, three.

430
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,833
Shit!

431
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:00,464
Ah.

432
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:01,635
Stand back.

433
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,102
Whoa.

434
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:21,819
What did she even eat?

435
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:24,526
- What?
- Eleven.

436
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:28,864
Oh.
Candy, leftovers, Eggos...

437
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,207
She really likes Eggos.

438
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,503
I knew you
were acting weird. I just...

439
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:37,626
I thought it was because of Will.

440
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,584
I knew you were acting weird, too.
I thought it was 'cause of Steve.

441
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:43,093
Hey...

442
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:47,011
No more secrets, okay?

443
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,183
From now on we tell each other everything.

444
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:52,262
Okay. Do you like Jonathan now?

445
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:54,313
What? No.

446
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,063
No, it's... it's not...
it's not like that.

447
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:00,896
Do you like Eleven?

448
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:04,323
What? No. Ew. Gross.

449
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:20,503
This will keep it dark for you.

450
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,675
Just like in your bathtub.

451
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:27,513
You're a very brave girl.

452
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,386
You know that, don't you?

453
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:34,395
Everything you're doing
for my boy... for Will...

454
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,481
for my family...

455
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,728
Thank you.

456
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,566
Listen.

457
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,949
I am gonna be there
with you the whole time.

458
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,996
And if it ever gets too scary...

459
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:57,453
in that place,
you just let me know, okay?

460
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:01,543
Yes.

461
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,255
Ready?

462
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,219
Ready.

463
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,200
Colder!

464
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:33,450
Warmer!

465
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:37,249
Right there!

466
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,134
Barb?

467
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:57,465
Barbara?

468
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,877
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

469
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,881
Is Barb okay?
Is she okay?

470
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,963
Gone! Gone!

471
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:38,798
Gone!

472
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:41,600
Gone! Gone!

473
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,928
Gone. Gone.

474
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,513
Gone.

475
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:47,394
It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

476
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:49,771
- Gone. Gone!
- It's okay. It's okay.

477
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,272
Gone!

478
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:53,104
Hey. It's okay.

479
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:55,690
It's okay, we're right here.
We're right here, honey.

480
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:59,027
<i>It's okay. I got you.</i>

481
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,954
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

482
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:06,159
<i>I'm right here with you.</i>

483
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:08,415
It's okay. It's okay.

484
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:10,792
<i>It's okay.</i>

485
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,999
<i>It's okay, you're safe.</i>

486
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:14,459
<i>You're okay, honey.</i>

487
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:16,961
Castle Byers.

488
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:18,922
Castle Byers.

489
00:34:58,346 --> 00:34:59,382
Will.

490
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,304
Will?

491
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,722
You... you tell him...
tell him I'm coming.

492
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,306
<i>Mom is coming.</i>

493
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,517
Your mom...
she's coming for you.

494
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:16,520
Hurry.

495
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,151
<i>Hurry.</i>

496
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:23,611
Okay. Listen, you tell him to...
to stay where he is.

497
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:26,698
We're coming. We're coming, okay?
We're coming, honey.

498
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,033
Just... just hold on a little longer.

499
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,210
Will. Will.

500
00:35:42,432 --> 00:35:43,548
Will?

501
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:45,592
Will!

502
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:54,274
Oh!

503
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:57,069
Oh, okay, okay.

504
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,317
I've got you.

505
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:02,616
It's okay.
I got you. I got you.

506
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:05,861
I got you, honey.
You did so good.

507
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:10,332
Are you okay?

508
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:13,870
So this fort.
Where is it?

509
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:15,750
Uh, it's in the woods
behind our house.

510
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,253
Yeah, he used to go there to hide.

511
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,256
Hey, get back inside.

512
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,466
What, are you insane?

513
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:27,891
- No, I'm...
- Look, if something happens to me,

514
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:29,013
I don't make it back...

515
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,766
Yeah, but then I'll go.
You stay.

516
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:31,971
Are you kidding me?

517
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:35,308
He's my son, Hop. My son.

518
00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:36,483
I'm going!

519
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,319
- Now, listen, I need you to stay here...
- No.

520
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:40,738
- And watch over the kids.
- No, Mom.

521
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:42,656
- I can help.
- Please, I need you to stay, Jonathan.

522
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:43,732
Joyce!

523
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:44,988
- Please.
- Please, be careful.

524
00:36:45,078 --> 00:36:46,614
- Joyce, come on!
- Please. I'm gonna find him.

525
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:48,446
I'm gonna find him.

526
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,819
We have to go back to the station.

527
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:27,322
What?

528
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:33,833
Your mom and Hopper
are just walking in there like bait.

529
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,832
That thing is still in there.

530
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:43,251
And we can't just sit here
and let it get them, too.

531
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:44,630
We can't.

532
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:51,012
You still wanna try it out?

533
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:54,057
I wanna finish what we started.

534
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:57,640
I want to kill it.

535
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:13,701
So this is your plan?

536
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,499
Worked for me before, didn't it?

537
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:17,793
- Well, did it?
- Come on, trust me.

538
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:21,004
<i>I'd like to hear
your thoughts on the war.</i>

539
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:23,082
<i>I think we're dealing with a whole
different environment here.</i>

540
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:24,838
<i>I'll tell you what,
we always planned</i>

541
00:38:24,928 --> 00:38:27,215
<i>on the Russians massing the fire and we...</i>

542
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:45,945
Don't move!

543
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,698
All right, move in.

544
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:50,242
It's all right.

545
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,694
Let me do the talking.

546
00:38:51,718 --> 00:38:59,718
