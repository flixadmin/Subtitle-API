Sorry.

522
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:39,530
So you weren't planning
on a shopping spree?

523
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,326
Then why exactly am I here?

524
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:47,538
I want you to live.

525
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,833
I think you'd like that
compared to being a rat in the lab.

00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:55,546
To liberate you, that's why I did this.

[Sang-wook] Humanity won't give up.

528

They already had you in their hands,

529
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,768
so I figured
they're taking this personally.

It doesn't matter.

[breathes shakily]
That's right.

533
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:21,614
You walked right into their hands,
didn't you?

534
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:24,908
Why was that?

535
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:27,328
I thought I told you

536
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,664
they'll rip you into pieces.

537
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,058
They'll dissect you over and over.

538
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,959
How many more times
do you have to hear that?

539
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:35,628
Is that why you ran away?

540
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:40,341
Because you were afraid of them?

541

I just wanted to live, okay?

Try worrying about something else.

Saving humans, all that shit,
fuck that, forget all that.

starting now.

There's gotta be a reason
you're a neohuman, isn't there?

I'm not going to kill people
