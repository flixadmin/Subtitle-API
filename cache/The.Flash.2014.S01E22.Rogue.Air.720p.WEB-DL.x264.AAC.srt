<i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

3
00:00:05,606 --> 00:00:07,539
<i>When I was a child,
I saw my mother killed</i>

4
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:08,540
<i>by something impossible.</i>

5
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:09,742
Run, Barry, run!

6
00:00:09,744 --> 00:00:12,611
<i>My father went to prison
for her murder.</i>

7
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:16,548
<i>Then an accident made me
the impossible.</i>

8
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,251
<i>To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

9
00:00:19,253 --> 00:00:22,287
<i>but secretly,
I use my speed to fight crime</i>

10
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:23,856
<i>and find others like me.</i>

11
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:26,525
<i>And one day, I'll find
who killed my mother...</i>

12
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:27,559
Mom!

13
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:28,961
<i>And get justice for my father.</i>

14
00:00:28,963 --> 00:00:31,630
<i>I am The Flash.</i>

15
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:33,399
Previously on<i> The Flash...</i>

16
00:00:33,401 --> 00:00:34,800
A man in yellow,
he took Eddie.

17
00:00:34,802 --> 00:00:35,901
Hi, Barry.

18
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:37,469
Or should I say The Flash?

19
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:40,973
Observe. Barry marries Iris,
and not you.

20
00:00:40,975 --> 00:00:43,175
- I've been having these dreams.
- What happens in the dreams?

21
00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:45,044
Dr. Wells is
the Reverse-Flash,

22
00:00:45,046 --> 00:00:47,212
and he kills me.

23
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:48,747
If this is Dr. Wells,

24
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:51,283
then who have we been
working for this whole time?

25
00:00:51,285 --> 00:00:53,552
A completely different person.

26
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:54,753
Oh, my God.

27
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:57,056
I don't want to kill you, Barry.
I need you.

28
00:00:57,058 --> 00:01:00,726
We will face each other again
very soon.

29
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:07,266
I want you to take a moment,

30
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:11,470
and think about all the things
that define your life.

31
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:16,742
All the people you love.

32
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:19,078
Your job.

33
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,047
Your coworkers.

34
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:25,417
Your home.

35
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:29,922
And now imagine if one day,

36
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:32,024
in a flash,

37
00:01:32,026 --> 00:01:35,127
all of that vanished.

38
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,198
Would you simply

39
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,402
accept your new life
and continue on?

40
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,774
Or would you do
whatever it takes...

41
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:58,450
to get back
what was taken from you?

42
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,953
Because...

43
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:03,155
I can assure you.

44
00:02:03,157 --> 00:02:07,559
I will get everything
that was taken...

45
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:11,530
from me.

Hey.

52
00:02:29,884 --> 00:02:33,085
Hey.

53
00:02:33,087 --> 00:02:35,053
What's all this?

54
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:37,422
Return labels
for Eddie and me.

55
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:39,758
I ordered 200 to start,
but this afternoon,

56
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,426
2,000 arrived.

57
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:44,796
I guess I ordered wrong.

58
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:48,367
I have so many now.

59
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:51,637
Iris, we're gonna find Eddie.

60
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:52,971
How?

61
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:54,306
You searched everywhere.

62
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:55,607
More than once.

63
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:57,809
And you haven't
found anything.

64
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:04,183
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:06,485
I'm not mad at you.

66
00:03:06,487 --> 00:03:11,089
- It's just...
- You miss him.

67
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:13,592
Yeah, I do.

68
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:26,238
Wells took my mom from me.

69
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,575
I won't let him take someone
from you, too.

70
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:37,749
Cisco.
I gotta go.

71
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,484
Yeah, go.

72
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,759
I kept asking myself,

73
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:51,463
why would Wells pretend
to need a wheelchair?

74
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:52,631
Sympathy, I suppose.

75
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:54,366
That's what I thought
at first,

76
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:56,168
but he's the man in yellow.
He's the Reverse-Flash.

77
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,336
He's much smarter than that.

78
00:03:57,338 --> 00:03:58,604
Sympathy can't be
the only reason.

79
00:03:58,606 --> 00:03:59,972
Yeah, it was a misdirect.

80
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:01,807
Just like everything else
Wells has done.

81
00:04:01,809 --> 00:04:04,743
I mean, the last person we'd
suspect to be the man in yellow

82
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,478
is someone who lost
the use of their legs.

83
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,113
That's exactly right, Joe.

84
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:11,283
Which is why I started messing
around with the wheelchair.

85
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,886
And that's when I found this.

86
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:21,426
Damn. You can't get that
at Radio Shack.

87
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:24,029
Looks like the tech
inside Gideon.

88
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:25,297
I measured the output,

89
00:04:25,299 --> 00:04:28,200
and this thing is kicking off
serious juice.

90
00:04:28,202 --> 00:04:29,501
I mean, we're talking
enough to power

91
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:30,702
all of Central City.

92
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:32,938
- Seriously?
- Oh, yeah.

93
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,841
What do you think
Wells was using it for?

94
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:38,910
I think this thing
is some kind of battery.

95
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:41,847
- Battery?
- As in, Wells was using it

96
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:43,982
to power himself.

97
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:45,417
To gain more speed.

98
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:48,487
And that's why
he's so much faster than you.

99
00:04:56,497 --> 00:04:58,897
The accelerator,
it's been reactivated.

100
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:00,832
- It can't be.
- How is that possible?

101
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:02,334
It blew up.

102
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:05,203
It had to have been rebuilt.

103
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:06,805
- Wells.
- Even if he did rebuild it,

104
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:10,809
how did Dr. Wells turn
the Particle Accelerator on?

105
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,177
He's here.

106
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:13,645
That's why we couldn't find him.

107
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:17,983
He's been inside S.T.A.R. Labs
the whole time.

108
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:20,052
Stay here.

109
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,907
Cisco, what did you bring in
that orange soda for?

110
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:44,176
Whenever something happens
with the Reverse-Flash,

111
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:45,610
liquid floats in the air.

112
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:49,114
You know, Barry's fish tank,
Wells's champagne,

113
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:51,416
Lance's coffee,
remember that?

114
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:53,485
If this does the same thing,

115
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:57,556
we'll know that Wells
is in there.

116
00:05:57,558 --> 00:05:59,091
Do it.

117
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:20,212
Man... this... is... big.

118
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:28,086
Oh, God.
Guys...

119
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:33,592
Barry!

120
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:37,062
Wha-what do we do now?

121
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:39,564
Prisoner release.
Protocol initiated.

122
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:46,371
Oh, no, no, no, no.

123
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:54,045
No!

124
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:00,919
Peek-a-boo.

125
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:09,361
Do you have any idea
what it's like

126
00:07:09,363 --> 00:07:13,131
to be stuck in that box?

127
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:20,839
Now you're the one
who's gonna go into a box.

128
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:23,041
In the ground.

129
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:24,576
Aah!

130
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,992
Aah!

131
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:59,311
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I will be.

132
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:00,378
Thanks to Iris.

133
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,614
I'm glad you showed up.

134
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:04,483
How do you think
she got out of there?

135
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:06,351
Wells must have released her.

136
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:08,186
- Help.
- Wait a sec.

137
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:09,921
Did you hear that?

138
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:11,756
I checked all
the containment cells.

139
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:13,358
Everyone's accounted for.

140
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,260
No, no. Listen.

141
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:20,198
Help! Down here!

142
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,134
Help!

143
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:27,506
Eddie?

144
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,910
Oh, partner.

145
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:35,046
Oh, my God.
I got you.

146
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:38,717
Oh, my God.

147
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,819
Eddie.
Are you okay?

148
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:42,020
Let's get him out of here.

149
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,021
Come on.

150
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:50,295
There you go.
Go slow.

151
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:21,259
Your vitals are normal,

152
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:23,194
but you're just
a little dehydrated.

153
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:26,731
The IV should help with that,
but drink some fluids

154
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,567
and stay off your feet,
Okay, Eddie?

155
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:31,403
Thanks, Caitlin.

156
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:32,470
Wells got away.

157
00:09:32,472 --> 00:09:33,905
Oh, he was too fast.

158
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,908
He's always too fast.
Eddie.

159
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,743
We found him under that hatch
in the pipeline.

160
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,245
I'm so sorry.

161
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:41,947
I thought I looked
everywhere for you.

162
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:43,281
Hey, it's not your fault.

163
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:45,150
Sometimes you just can't
see the clues.

164
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:48,587
Even if they're right
in front of you.

165
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:50,121
Um, well, you know,

166
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:52,290
all that's important
is that we're all safe,

167
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:54,059
and back together, right?

168
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:57,329
Eddie, why did he take you?

169
00:09:58,665 --> 00:09:59,831
I don't know.

170
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:04,869
He said that
we're... family.

171
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:07,672
Said his real name
was Eobard Thawne.

172
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:11,276
Eobard Thawne?

173
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,178
Just like in my dream.

174
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,546
Did he say anything else?

175
00:10:14,548 --> 00:10:16,548
I mean, anything
that could help us

176
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,416
figure out what
he's really after?

177
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:20,518
I... he didn't say much.

178
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,821
He just kept working
on some tube.

179
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:24,522
A tube?
What did it look like?

180
00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:27,592
Metallic, futuristic.

181
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:29,427
He said it was the key to him

182
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:32,697
getting back everything
that was taken from him.

183
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:34,899
The key?
I don't understand. Wha...

184
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:38,536
Yeah, I don't know.
Look, I just want to go home.

185
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:42,073
- Is that okay?
- Yes, of course.

186
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:44,643
I'll make sure
he gets some rest.

187
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:46,378
Okay.

188
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:53,685
What do you think
Wells was talking about?

189
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:01,559
Oh, no, no, no.

190
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:04,996
What?

191
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,297
What now?

192
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:09,000
Um, are you seeing this?

193
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,869
That's the tube
Eddie was talking about.

194
00:11:10,871 --> 00:11:12,871
It's some sort of
future power source.

195
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:14,706
That's what's charging up
the accelerator.

196
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,007
Can you shut it down?

197
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,776
Do you see a power button

198
00:11:17,778 --> 00:11:19,277
anywhere on this thing?

199
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,980
Dude, this thing
is from the future.

200
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:23,782
It's beyond me.
I press,

201
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:26,017
or touch, or cut
the wrong thing,

202
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,485
I could bring
the whole building down.

203
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:31,423
Okay. How long until
it's fully functional?

204
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:34,693
Best I can tell, 36 hours.

205
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:36,227
That's when Wells
will be back.

206
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:38,430
Why would Wells want
the Particle Accelerator

207
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:39,831
to work again?

208
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:40,999
I don't know.
It's not like it was

209
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:42,967
such a big success
the first time.

210
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:44,502
It made me The Flash.

211
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:47,372
That's not all it did.

212
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:50,241
So what happens if the
Particle Accelerator turns on

213
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:52,444
while the meta-humans are in
their containment cells?

214
00:11:52,446 --> 00:11:53,945
They're toast.

215
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:55,413
We put them down there

216
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:57,415
and now their lives
are in danger because of us.

217
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:58,817
Look, I think you all know

218
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:01,186
I've never been a fan
of this arrangement here.

219
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:03,688
I thought the whole plan
was to rehabilitate them

220
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,056
and set them free.

221
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:08,026
It was.
We've been a little busy.

222
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:09,994
Well, if they stay in there,
they die.

223
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:12,530
And if we let them go,
they destroy the city.

224
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:13,832
We're gonna have to
move them.

225
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:15,233
Move them where?

226
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,001
Iron Heights can't
handle meta-humans.

227
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:21,139
You're right,
but Lian Yu can.

228
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:22,774
What the hell's a "Lian Yu?"

229
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:24,042
Lian Yu is the island
where Oliver

230
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:25,376
was stranded for five years.

231
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:27,679
A.R.G.U.S built
a covert military prison on it.

232
00:12:27,681 --> 00:12:29,314
It's where we sent
Captain Boomerang.

233
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:32,150
Oliver keeps
his worst criminals there.

234
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:33,818
They won't be able to escape,
and more importantly,

235
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,320
they won't be able
to hurt anybody.

236
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:39,324
Great. So we ship them
from one illegal black site

237
00:12:39,326 --> 00:12:40,759
to another?

238
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:43,161
Yeah, I guess so.
Yes.

239
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:47,031
And how do we move them to
Oliver's own private Alcatraz?

240
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:49,167
I'll call him. Maybe he can help
with transport.

241
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:50,468
And Cisco...

242
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:53,705
if we do this,
nobody can get loose.

243
00:12:53,707 --> 00:12:55,907
I might have a way of
getting them out of here safely.

244
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:57,809
All right, get on it.

245
00:12:57,811 --> 00:12:59,878
Barr, this is insane.

246
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,646
Joe, we have to do this.

247
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:03,782
You don't think that
if we start

248
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:05,784
bussing super-villains
through downtown,

249
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:06,885
nobody's gonna notice?

250
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:08,052
Oh, they'll notice.

251
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:09,954
That's where you'll come in.

252
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,392
Oh.

253
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:16,828
Cecile.

254
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:17,996
Aww.

255
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:19,464
How's my favorite DA?

256
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:20,799
Thanks for stopping by.

257
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:23,334
Hey, anything for
my favorite detective.

258
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:27,806
Hey.

259
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:29,107
So what can I do for you?

260
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:30,809
You sounded a little cryptic
on the phone.

261
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:34,245
Yeah, I wanted your opinion
on something.

262
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:37,982
These people with powers,
the meta-humans.

263
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,984
Is that what
they're calling them?

264
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:41,152
People love their labels.

265
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:44,823
Yes.
Let's say, hypothetically,

266
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:47,058
I know a prison of sorts,

267
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,961
a place that can do
what Iron Heights can't.

268
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:52,897
Where these meta-humans,
the bad ones,

269
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:56,034
are being locked up.

270
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:58,269
I would be very concerned.

271
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:00,138
Especially if,
hypothetically,

272
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,308
you had anything
to do with it.

273
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,276
Why are you asking me
about this?

274
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:07,445
Well, because Singh's
on his honeymoon,

275
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:13,051
and you're the only other person
I can trust to know this.

276
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:15,587
Okay, what are you
asking me to do?

277
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:17,555
I need to clear a route

278
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:19,257
through the city.

279
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:20,892
Barricades, police cars,
the works.

280
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:21,993
What am I
supposed to tell people?

281
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:23,428
The President's in town?

282
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,729
I don't know.
You think they'll believe you?

283
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:27,232
No, Joe, no.
They wouldn't.

284
00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:29,234
What you're doing,
it's called

285
00:14:29,236 --> 00:14:31,102
unlawful imprisonment
and human smuggling.

286
00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:33,304
Joe, those are
very bad things.

287
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:37,275
These are some
bad people, Cecile.

288
00:14:37,277 --> 00:14:39,577
But their lives
are in danger.

289
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:41,646
I can't... I can't
get involved in this, Joe.

290
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:45,583
I can't.

291
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:48,253
And as your friend,
and quite possibly the attorney

292
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:50,288
who will one day
be prosecuting you,

293
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:53,992
I'm telling you, get as far
away from this as possible.

294
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:06,170
Okay, so A.R.G.U.S. has
a transport plane

295
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:08,206
that can take the meta-humans
to Lian Yu.

296
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:10,208
We just need to get them
to Ferris Airfield.

297
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,342
So Oliver Queen
came through then?

298
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:13,278
Uh, no.
Actually, it was not him.

299
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,213
Apparently he's in
Nanda Parbat...

300
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:16,614
- What?
- Wherever that is.

301
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:19,684
I don't know.
I called Lyla, Diggle's wife.

302
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:21,286
She's gonna hook us up.

303
00:15:21,288 --> 00:15:24,455
So, what about CCPD
giving us an escort?

304
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:26,157
- Man, it ain't happening.
- What?

305
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,659
You saw me talking to the DA.

306
00:15:27,661 --> 00:15:29,060
She was very clear.

307
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:30,795
I could lose my badge.
I could go to jail.

308
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:34,866
- We could go to jail.
- We... we are protecting people.

309
00:15:34,868 --> 00:15:37,769
We are, Barry,
but... I'm a cop.

310
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:39,871
There's a certain set
of rules I need to follow,

311
00:15:39,873 --> 00:15:41,406
and this year,
I broke all of them.

312
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:43,207
- Lying to my boss...
- I know.

313
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:44,709
Ignoring the law.

314
00:15:44,711 --> 00:15:46,311
I mean, at what point
do we become no different

315
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:48,012
than the people
we're fighting?

316
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:49,814
- We are way different.
- How?

317
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:52,917
We only break the rules
to help people.

318
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:04,395
Give me another one.

319
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:06,798
Ice cold.

320
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:15,406
Well, well, well.

321
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:18,076
If it isn't
the scarlet speedster.

322
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:20,445
We need to talk.

323
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:31,055
You want anything?
Beer, food?

324
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:33,124
Pickled eggs here
are fantastic.

325
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,894
No, I'm good.
I need your help with a problem.

326
00:16:36,896 --> 00:16:40,098
Must be pretty desperate to come
asking for my assistance,

327
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,467
but I'll bite.
What do you need?

328
00:16:42,469 --> 00:16:45,069
Help transporting
some people out of the city.

329
00:16:45,071 --> 00:16:48,106
- How many?
- Five.

330
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:50,208
Five very bad,

331
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:53,144
very angry people

332
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:55,446
who have powers.

333
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:56,848
Powers, hmm?

334
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,550
So you want me to what?
Freeze the problem?

335
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:03,454
Protect you from them
if anything goes wrong?

336
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:07,525
First rule of business:
always protect yourself.

337
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:10,528
I'm not gonna help
usher your enemies out of town.

338
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,929
Hey, they're not just
my enemies.

339
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:13,398
They're your enemies, too.

340
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,732
I doubt it.

341
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,904
They will destroy
Central City.

342
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:22,006
It's not my problem.

343
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:24,575
You said that you love it here.
That this is your home.

344
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:25,810
I do and it is.

345
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:27,345
Well, guess what?

346
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:28,579
These people get loose,

347
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:32,050
there won't be a city
to love anymore.

348
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:33,217
You won't be able to
rob anyone

349
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,086
if everybody's dead.

350
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:40,992
It's a compelling argument.

351
00:17:40,994 --> 00:17:42,994
But if I'm gonna
help you out...

352
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:48,933
I'll need something
in return.

353
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:52,737
- Like what?
- This.

354
00:17:54,941 --> 00:17:57,642
No.
This is impossible.

355
00:17:57,644 --> 00:18:00,011
- I can't do that.
- Then I can't help you.

356
00:18:00,013 --> 00:18:02,213
There has to...

357
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:03,981
Snart, there has to be
something you want

358
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:05,583
that I can get.

359
00:18:08,822 --> 00:18:09,987
Let me think about it.

360
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:13,391
♪ Cold as ice I know ♪

361
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:15,593
♪ As cold as ice ♪

362
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,100
Eddie.

363
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:24,869
- Hey.
- Where have you been?

364
00:18:24,871 --> 00:18:26,404
Here.
Work.

365
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:27,872
You were kidnapped
for nearly two weeks

366
00:18:27,874 --> 00:18:29,674
and your first thought
is to go back to work?

367
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:32,910
I just needed something
constant in my life.

368
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:34,278
I thought that was us.

369
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,814
Eddie, I miss you.

370
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:37,949
I love you.

371
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,684
Hey.

372
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:43,154
I saw this when we found you.

373
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:44,956
This was for me, wasn't it?

374
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,824
When you took me
to the waterfront

375
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:50,394
and Dr. Wells abducted you,
you were going to propose.

376
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:52,763
I was.

377
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:55,333
But now you're not?

378
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:59,137
What did he do to you?

379
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:01,472
He didn't do
anything to me, Iris.

380
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:02,673
It's what he showed me.

381
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:04,375
What could he possibly
have shown you

382
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:06,043
that would make you
change your mind about us?

383
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:08,146
The future.

384
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:11,082
He showed me
the future, Iris.

385
00:19:11,084 --> 00:19:13,217
We don't get married.

386
00:19:13,219 --> 00:19:15,219
You and Barry do.

387
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:18,589
Look, I gotta go.

388
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:26,130
Are you out of your mind?

389
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:28,099
What do you mean
you talked to Leonard Snart?

390
00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:29,367
I asked him for help.

391
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:30,868
Barry, why would you do
something so stupid?

392
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,671
Because, Joe, we have already
tried everyone else.

393
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,374
Look, you tried the CCPD.
I tried Oliver.

394
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:38,276
I even tried Ronnie
and Dr. Stein.

395
00:19:38,278 --> 00:19:40,011
And the Particle Accelerator
goes online in...

396
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:41,112
16 hours.

397
00:19:41,114 --> 00:19:43,481
16 hours, Joe.

398
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:45,283
I'm not willing
to let the metas die,

399
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:46,751
and we can't let them
escape, either.

400
00:19:46,753 --> 00:19:49,620
So, like it or not,
Snart, with his cold gun,

401
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:51,022
is the only one
that can stop them

402
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:53,658
if Cisco's transportation
does not hold.

403
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:57,395
Then lucky for you I figured out
what it is you can get me.

404
00:19:57,397 --> 00:19:59,697
Hello, Detective.
Nice to see you again.

405
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,567
Caitlin, Cisco.

406
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:04,569
I thought about
your proposal.

407
00:20:04,571 --> 00:20:08,239
You want my help,
this is what I want.

408
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:10,441
My fingerprints,
dental records,

409
00:20:10,443 --> 00:20:14,111
DNA, criminal records,
family tree,

410
00:20:14,113 --> 00:20:16,914
everything there is
in this world

411
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,849
concerning Leonard Snart.

412
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:20,785
I want it destroyed.

413
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:22,253
All of it.

414
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:26,457
At CCPD, online, everywhere.

415
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:28,392
The brass on this dude.

416
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:31,362
You really think
we'd do that for you?

417
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:33,397
I'll do it.

418
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,233
If it's the only way, fine.

419
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:37,835
You and me need to talk
right now.

420
00:20:45,511 --> 00:20:46,911
What is wrong with you?

421
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:48,946
You can't just erase
Snart's criminal record.

422
00:20:48,948 --> 00:20:51,515
Yeah, I can. And I'll do
whatever I have to do.

423
00:20:51,517 --> 00:20:53,017
Barry, there's gotta be
a different way to do this.

424
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:54,619
Okay, well, what is it, Joe?

425
00:20:54,621 --> 00:20:56,320
Tell me what it is,
and we'll do it.

426
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:59,156
We're running out of time!

427
00:20:59,158 --> 00:21:01,659
What is going on with you?

428
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:03,294
You working with that killer.

429
00:21:03,296 --> 00:21:05,997
This isn't who you are.

430
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:09,667
Who I am is the guy who's not
fast enough to stop Wells.

431
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:11,869
He... he hasn't been
one step ahead of us, Joe.

432
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:13,871
He's been 1,000.
I can't catch him.

433
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:15,039
I can't beat him.

434
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:18,242
What I can do is save
those people down there.

435
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:19,577
Wells turned them into
what they are,

436
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:21,879
and I'm pretty sure
he does not care

437
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:23,214
if they live or die.

438
00:21:23,216 --> 00:21:24,282
I do.

439
00:21:30,556 --> 00:21:31,722
Oh.

440
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:43,301
Bye-bye, Leonard Snart.

441
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:50,374
I've deleted everything
the CCPD,

442
00:21:50,376 --> 00:21:52,243
A.R.G.U.S., and the FBI
had on you,

443
00:21:52,245 --> 00:21:55,880
and sent a virus to erase every
digital record of you online.

444
00:21:55,882 --> 00:21:58,416
And this is
every single piece

445
00:21:58,418 --> 00:22:01,018
of physical evidence
the police had.

446
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,186
Good.

447
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:11,696
I hear we're all
going to be working together.

448
00:22:11,698 --> 00:22:14,298
That's right, Sis.

449
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,000
Partners.

450
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:26,010
Please tell me
this is a joke.

451
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:28,212
Oh, you were right, Lenny.

452
00:22:28,214 --> 00:22:29,547
She is very uptight.

453
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:31,782
I am not uptight.

454
00:22:34,487 --> 00:22:36,420
You can't call me uptight.

455
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:40,157
Look, guys,

456
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,426
we need their help
if we're gonna pull this off.

457
00:22:42,428 --> 00:22:43,728
Why are you wearing
your mask?

458
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,496
Snart already knows
who you are.

459
00:22:45,498 --> 00:22:47,298
And I promised
I wouldn't tell anyone.

460
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,100
That includes my sister.

461
00:22:49,102 --> 00:22:50,167
Jerk.

462
00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:52,670
Trainwreck.

463
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:55,206
Don't look so surprised,
Detective.

464
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:57,208
I am a man of my word.

465
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,809
Yeah, you better be.

466
00:22:58,811 --> 00:23:01,712
Or I'm gonna make sure
you're on that damn plane, too.

467
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:08,686
Hey, Cisco.

468
00:23:08,688 --> 00:23:12,189
Oh, hey,
Captain Cold's evil sister.

469
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:13,457
Aww.

470
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:15,926
You're not still
mad at me, are you?

471
00:23:15,928 --> 00:23:19,397
I really did enjoy
kissing you.

472
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:20,498
You kissed her?

473
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,967
Under duress.
Calm down.

474
00:23:22,969 --> 00:23:26,570
I've... I've thought a lot
about you.

475
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:28,773
Have you really?

476
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:33,310
Well, stop.

477
00:23:33,312 --> 00:23:37,648
Because this right here,

478
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:40,317
it ain't gonna happen.

479
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:41,986
A girl can hope.

480
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:48,392
Really not enjoying

481
00:23:48,394 --> 00:23:50,327
being one of the good guys
this week.

482
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:51,395
Really not.

483
00:23:51,397 --> 00:23:52,463
Hey, dude.

484
00:23:52,465 --> 00:23:53,664
Have you figured
out a way to get

485
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:55,566
the meta-humans
to the airport?

486
00:23:55,568 --> 00:23:57,468
I have, actually.

487
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,003
And it's pretty dope.

488
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:02,339
This is cool.
Where'd you get this?

489
00:24:02,341 --> 00:24:03,674
My uncle owns it.

490
00:24:03,676 --> 00:24:06,710
His company hauls
frozen food cross country.

491
00:24:06,712 --> 00:24:09,346
Okay, so I retrofitted
the cooling system

492
00:24:09,348 --> 00:24:10,748
with the wheelchair's
power source

493
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:13,184
to create an energy damper.

494
00:24:13,186 --> 00:24:14,885
Which means what, exactly?

495
00:24:14,887 --> 00:24:17,221
Basically, the back of this rig
is being flooded

496
00:24:17,223 --> 00:24:19,723
with so much power
that it's effectively creating

497
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:21,559
a transient pulse
strong enough to disrupt

498
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:23,494
the meta-humans' powers,
so we can get them

499
00:24:23,496 --> 00:24:24,829
to the airport and get them
on a plane

500
00:24:24,831 --> 00:24:26,864
without them getting
fresh on us.

501
00:24:26,866 --> 00:24:28,265
Technically, we need somebody

502
00:24:28,267 --> 00:24:30,067
with a Class A commercial
driver's license

503
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:31,335
to drive this, though.

504
00:24:31,337 --> 00:24:33,871
I can drive it.

505
00:24:33,873 --> 00:24:36,507
What?
I have a Class A CDL.

506
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:38,976
- You do?
- We can't all be doctors.

507
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:40,377
All right, well,
let's do this.

508
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:42,746
Plane's gonna be here
in two hours.

509
00:24:42,748 --> 00:24:45,015
Hey, hey!
What the hell?

510
00:24:45,017 --> 00:24:46,283
Hey!

511
00:24:46,285 --> 00:24:48,419
Hey!

512
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:58,863
It's done.
They're all unconscious.

513
00:25:04,136 --> 00:25:05,636
Dampeners are
fully functional.

514
00:25:05,638 --> 00:25:06,937
All right.

515
00:25:06,939 --> 00:25:08,739
I'll make sure
the roads are clear.

516
00:25:08,741 --> 00:25:10,241
Do not stop for anything.

517
00:25:10,243 --> 00:25:12,409
Let's move out.

518
00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:13,677
After you.

519
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,470
Hey, we got traffic up ahead.

520
00:25:39,472 --> 00:25:41,005
I'm on it.

521
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:46,911
How's our cargo doing?

522
00:25:46,913 --> 00:25:49,313
All quiet so far.

523
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:05,629
Don't bother.

524
00:26:05,631 --> 00:26:08,432
Your powers don't work in here.
None of ours do.

525
00:26:08,434 --> 00:26:09,800
What the hell's going on?

526
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:11,802
- They're moving us.
- Where?

527
00:26:11,804 --> 00:26:14,538
Funny,
I didn't get an itinerary.

528
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,407
Hey!

529
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:19,476
Tall, dark, and handsome,
I said your powers are offline.

530
00:26:19,478 --> 00:26:22,680
All brawn, no brains.

531
00:26:22,682 --> 00:26:25,015
I know you, don't I?

532
00:26:25,017 --> 00:26:26,317
Kyle Nimbus.

533
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:28,619
Used to be a member
of the Darbinyan crime family.

534
00:26:28,621 --> 00:26:29,920
That's right.

535
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:32,156
Weren't you executed
about a year ago?

536
00:26:32,158 --> 00:26:33,190
It didn't take.

537
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:35,059
No.
The Darbinyans weren't known

538
00:26:35,061 --> 00:26:36,760
for hiring
the best and brightest.

539
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:38,128
You couldn't even die right.

540
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,764
So you're so stupid mad
right now, Mardon,

541
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:43,067
you're just going to
pick a fight with anyone?

542
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:44,168
Guess so.

543
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:46,036
If I had my powers right now,

544
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:49,306
I would gas you all
out of existence.

545
00:26:49,308 --> 00:26:51,508
And then you'd be standing
in a container

546
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,410
with four corpses.

547
00:26:53,412 --> 00:26:55,245
What would that get you?

548
00:26:55,247 --> 00:26:56,714
Peace and quiet.

549
00:27:00,186 --> 00:27:01,485
Well, I don't know
about you guys,

550
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:02,653
but I don't need my powers

551
00:27:02,655 --> 00:27:06,056
to fill this rig
full of bodies.

552
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:07,524
Come on.

553
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:18,802
What was that?

554
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:20,704
Wherever they're taking us,

555
00:27:20,706 --> 00:27:22,239
we're here.

556
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:27,077
Ferris Air?

557
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:29,113
I thought this place
got shut down.

558
00:27:29,115 --> 00:27:30,114
It did.

559
00:27:30,116 --> 00:27:32,082
One of their test pilots
disappeared.

560
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:33,951
So what's the plan?
I want to get this over with.

561
00:27:33,953 --> 00:27:35,986
It should be here any minute.

562
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:37,988
Look, Joe, I know
you don't agree with this...

563
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:42,126
Save it, Barr.
I just want to get it done.

564
00:27:42,128 --> 00:27:44,328
How come you haven't
given me a code name?

565
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:47,064
I heard you came up
with Captain Cold.

566
00:27:47,066 --> 00:27:49,400
What do you think
I should be called?

567
00:27:49,402 --> 00:27:51,135
Female inmate.

568
00:27:51,137 --> 00:27:52,936
Oh, come on.

569
00:27:52,938 --> 00:27:54,805
You made my gun.
Least you can do

570
00:27:54,807 --> 00:27:56,707
is give me a badass alias.

571
00:27:58,544 --> 00:28:01,011
Please?

572
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:04,248
Fine.

573
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:07,718
Golden Glider.

574
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,054
Smart is sexy, Cisco.

575
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:16,093
Your A.R.G.U.S. friends
aren't very prompt.

576
00:28:16,095 --> 00:28:19,797
Maybe that's why they've never
been able to catch me.

577
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:21,598
Look, there it is.

578
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:28,172
Turning on each other
won't solve anything.

579
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:31,508
Don't ever touch me.

580
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,477
Wait.

581
00:28:33,479 --> 00:28:35,045
Look.

582
00:28:42,621 --> 00:28:43,854
Oops.

583
00:28:45,925 --> 00:28:47,825
- Uh-oh.
- What's wrong?

584
00:28:47,827 --> 00:28:49,827
That's not good.

585
00:28:53,733 --> 00:28:56,600
Guys, guys, we have a problem.

586
00:28:56,602 --> 00:28:58,035
The damper's fluctuating.

587
00:28:58,037 --> 00:29:00,070
The rig's losing power.
I don't know why.

588
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:02,272
- Wait, can you do something?
- I'm trying.

589
00:29:05,044 --> 00:29:08,479
Oh, God.

590
00:29:08,481 --> 00:29:10,481
Mardon.

591
00:29:21,894 --> 00:29:24,094
Trip's canceled!

592
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:28,465
Take your last breath!

593
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:49,620
I'm outta here.

594
00:29:49,622 --> 00:29:50,788
Aah!

595
00:29:59,598 --> 00:30:01,331
Caitlin, get down!

596
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:08,105
You locked Ronnie
in the pipeline

597
00:30:08,107 --> 00:30:09,540
and you killed Ronnie!

598
00:30:09,542 --> 00:30:11,108
- Caitlin, Caitlin, stop!
- He killed Ronnie!

599
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,710
- He killed Ronnie!
- What are you doing?

600
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:38,168
Finish him, Simmons.

601
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:52,282
How about we call tonight
a tie?

602
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:57,821
I'd power down if you don't want
me to melt your face.

603
00:30:57,823 --> 00:31:01,491
Let's all go
our separate ways.

604
00:31:01,493 --> 00:31:02,926
My name is Leonard Snart.

605
00:31:02,928 --> 00:31:04,127
I know who you are.

606
00:31:04,129 --> 00:31:06,697
Always pleased to meet a fan.

607
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:08,365
Just remember who it was
made sure

608
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:10,434
you didn't get thrown
on that plane

609
00:31:10,436 --> 00:31:12,135
bound for nowhere.

610
00:31:12,137 --> 00:31:15,639
You're just letting us go?

611
00:31:15,641 --> 00:31:17,574
Why'd you shoot that guy?

612
00:31:17,576 --> 00:31:20,310
He owed me money.

613
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:22,412
Mmm.

614
00:31:22,414 --> 00:31:24,414
What?
You want a "thank you?"

615
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:28,752
Who doesn't like
a "thank you?"

616
00:31:28,754 --> 00:31:30,187
Thank you.

617
00:31:30,189 --> 00:31:33,957
You are so very welcome.

618
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:52,809
You sabotaged the truck,
didn't you?

619
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,180
Why did you let them escape?

620
00:31:57,182 --> 00:31:59,416
Because now they all owe me.

621
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:01,919
And something tells me
they'll be a lot more use to me

622
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:03,921
as part of my rogues
than rotting away

623
00:32:03,923 --> 00:32:06,690
in the North China sea.

624
00:32:06,692 --> 00:32:07,958
You gave me your word.

625
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,826
It's true, I did.

626
00:32:09,828 --> 00:32:11,361
But here's the thing.

627
00:32:11,363 --> 00:32:14,164
I'm a criminal and a liar,

628
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:15,899
and I hurt people,

629
00:32:15,901 --> 00:32:17,601
and I rob them.

630
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:20,170
What did you expect me to do?
Not be what I am?

631
00:32:20,172 --> 00:32:23,807
I saw an opportunity
to turn things to my advantage,

632
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:25,008
and I did.

633
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:28,578
Who you're really mad at
is yourself.

634
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:32,215
This is on you, Barry.

635
00:32:32,217 --> 00:32:36,853
Then why don't you
just kill me?

636
00:32:36,855 --> 00:32:40,657
Well, I guess you owe
me one now, too.

637
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:42,659
Good luck with...

638
00:32:42,661 --> 00:32:44,594
all of this.

639
00:32:44,596 --> 00:32:47,497
I'm actually really excited
to see how it all turns out.

640
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:51,034
Hey, hey, hey.

641
00:32:53,605 --> 00:32:55,472
Bye, Cisco.

642
00:33:14,994 --> 00:33:18,228
Hey, Cisco told me
you were in here.

643
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:20,564
How's Caitlin doing?

644
00:33:20,566 --> 00:33:22,532
He used that
light thingie on her.

645
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:23,800
She's fine.

646
00:33:23,802 --> 00:33:25,302
Mostly embarrassed.

647
00:33:25,304 --> 00:33:27,571
Yeah.

648
00:33:27,573 --> 00:33:30,640
Thanks for not saying,
"I told you so."

649
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:33,310
But I did tell you so.

650
00:33:33,312 --> 00:33:34,945
Repeatedly.

651
00:33:34,947 --> 00:33:36,880
I just...

652
00:33:36,882 --> 00:33:39,583
Man, I've seen the way
that Oliver does things,

653
00:33:39,585 --> 00:33:42,686
and he's not afraid to just
do whatever it takes

654
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:45,122
to get what he needs,
and I thought that I could

655
00:33:45,124 --> 00:33:46,123
do that too.

656
00:33:46,125 --> 00:33:48,925
I thought I could just

657
00:33:48,927 --> 00:33:51,028
use Snart,
but instead he used me.

658
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:54,765
You're not the Arrow, Barry.

659
00:33:54,767 --> 00:33:56,199
No.

660
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:58,735
That's not the kind of hero
you are.

661
00:34:02,074 --> 00:34:03,507
What kind am I?

662
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:05,542
The kind that cares about
whether or not

663
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:07,978
those criminals
lived or died.

664
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:12,416
I mean, whatever Mardon
and Nimbus and Shawna did,

665
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:14,618
they're human beings.

666
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:19,222
And you knew letting Wells
use them as pawns was wrong.

667
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:21,625
You know the difference
between right and wrong.

668
00:34:21,627 --> 00:34:23,860
And you weren't willing
to blur the lines

669
00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:25,962
between the two.

670
00:34:25,964 --> 00:34:28,732
That's the kind of man
you are.

671
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:32,135
And that's what makes you
different than the Arrow.

672
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:38,208
So, please...

673
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:42,846
no more walks
on the dark side.

674
00:34:42,848 --> 00:34:44,181
Agreed?

675
00:34:44,183 --> 00:34:46,683
Yeah.

676
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:50,220
- What the hell is that?
- Guys...

677
00:34:50,222 --> 00:34:53,156
The Particle Accelerator
is fully charged and online.

678
00:34:53,158 --> 00:34:55,859
Whatever Wells needs it for,
it's ready.

679
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:07,838
Iris, there really isn't
anything else to say.

680
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,239
Are you kidding me?

681
00:35:09,241 --> 00:35:10,540
You're going to end
this relationship

682
00:35:10,542 --> 00:35:12,509
because some lunatic
from the future

683
00:35:12,511 --> 00:35:15,479
told you that I am destined
to marry Barry?

684
00:35:15,481 --> 00:35:17,114
Well, I don't believe that,
okay?

685
00:35:17,116 --> 00:35:19,716
I believe that we choose
our own destiny.

686
00:35:19,718 --> 00:35:24,020
I decide who I love,
and I love you.

687
00:35:24,022 --> 00:35:26,022
Whatever future
Wells showed you,

688
00:35:26,024 --> 00:35:28,959
it is not my future.

689
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:31,862
It's not our future.

690
00:35:31,864 --> 00:35:34,464
Please let me prove it.

691
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:37,334
This isn't about
the future, Iris.

692
00:35:37,336 --> 00:35:38,902
It's about here.

693
00:35:38,904 --> 00:35:41,071
Now.
Today.

694
00:35:41,073 --> 00:35:42,606
Ever since
the very beginning,

695
00:35:42,608 --> 00:35:45,175
there's been three people
in this relationship.

696
00:35:45,177 --> 00:35:47,944
You, me, and Barry.

697
00:35:47,946 --> 00:35:49,112
That is not true.

698
00:35:49,114 --> 00:35:51,348
You can deny it all you want.

699
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:53,583
But Barry knows it.

700
00:35:53,585 --> 00:35:54,951
Joe knows it.

701
00:35:54,953 --> 00:35:59,122
And if I'm gonna be
completely honest with myself,

702
00:35:59,124 --> 00:36:01,591
I knew.

703
00:36:01,593 --> 00:36:04,394
I always knew.

704
00:36:04,396 --> 00:36:06,062
I guess I just...

705
00:36:06,064 --> 00:36:08,965
thought I could love you enough
to change things.

706
00:36:11,303 --> 00:36:13,003
I'm sorry.

707
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,840
But if you really do love me,

708
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:18,808
you'll let this end.

709
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,477
Fine.

710
00:36:23,916 --> 00:36:26,082
Then it ends.

711
00:36:43,802 --> 00:36:46,736
Barry, don't even
think about it.

712
00:36:46,738 --> 00:36:48,605
Barr, no.

713
00:36:48,607 --> 00:36:51,241
You can't go out there
by yourself.

714
00:36:51,243 --> 00:36:52,943
Yeah, I can.

715
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:02,185
Well, I heard your prison
transfer didn't go so well.

716
00:37:02,187 --> 00:37:03,587
I'm so sorry.

717
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:05,522
All a part of your plan,
I assume?

718
00:37:05,524 --> 00:37:08,825
Actually, that didn't factor
into my plan at all,

719
00:37:08,827 --> 00:37:11,595
but I'm impressed
you went to such great lengths

720
00:37:11,597 --> 00:37:14,664
to keep those people
from harm.

721
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:17,033
Ever the hero, huh, Barry?

722
00:37:17,035 --> 00:37:18,468
You've hurt enough people.

723
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,670
I know.
You see me as the villain,

724
00:37:20,672 --> 00:37:23,940
but, Barry,
if you were to look back,

725
00:37:23,942 --> 00:37:26,076
look back carefully

726
00:37:26,078 --> 00:37:28,211
at everything I've done,

727
00:37:28,213 --> 00:37:31,281
every wheel
I have set in motion,

728
00:37:31,283 --> 00:37:35,018
you would realize
I have only done

729
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,886
what I had to do.

730
00:37:36,888 --> 00:37:39,055
Nothing more.

731
00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:41,424
Nothing less.

732
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:43,059
And the Particle Accelerator?

733
00:37:43,061 --> 00:37:45,262
How does that fit into
your grand plan?

734
00:37:45,264 --> 00:37:47,831
Well, why don't you
go on inside,

735
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:48,932
and let me show you.

736
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:50,900
You know,
I just learned the hard way

737
00:37:50,902 --> 00:37:52,936
not to trust the bad guy.

738
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:54,804
And yet...

739
00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:56,206
I've shown you

740
00:37:56,208 --> 00:37:58,441
time and time again

741
00:37:58,443 --> 00:37:59,843
you can't beat me, Barry.

742
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:05,915
- Ronnie.
- Firestorm.

743
00:38:09,388 --> 00:38:12,922
Wow. You brought yourself
a friend.

744
00:38:18,563 --> 00:38:21,197
Welcome, Mr. Queen.

745
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:22,832
Hope we're not too late.

746
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:23,800
You're just in time.

747
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:26,636
I don't care how fast
you are.

748
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:29,406
You can't fight all three of us
at the same time.

749
00:38:29,408 --> 00:38:32,876
Oh, I can't?

750
00:38:32,878 --> 00:38:34,411
Trust me.

751
00:38:34,413 --> 00:38:37,947
This...
This is gonna be fun.

752
00:38:57,902 --> 00:38:59,803
Move, Barry.

753
00:39:01,073 --> 00:39:02,238
Barry, move!

754
00:39:13,618 --> 00:39:14,951
Come on!

755
00:39:17,255 --> 00:39:18,321
Ronnie.

756

Nanites, courtesy of
Ray Palmer.

757
00:39:23,729 --> 00:39:25,662
They're delivering
a high frequency pulse

758
00:39:25,664 --> 00:39:27,330
that's disabling your speed.

759
00:39:27,332 --> 00:39:30,200
You're not gonna be running
around for quite a while.

760
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,747
Aah!

761
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:09,372
The history books say

762
00:40:09,374 --> 00:40:12,208
you live to be
86 years old, Mr. Queen.

763
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:14,811
Well, I guess
the history books

764
00:40:14,813 --> 00:40:16,813
are wrong.

765
00:40:21,486 --> 00:40:23,586
That's the spirit.

766
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:26,256
You can't stop me, Flash.

767
00:40:26,258 --> 00:40:28,158
And you never will.

768
00:40:44,241 --> 00:40:45,408
Now!

769
00:41:29,054 --> 00:41:30,553
Thanks, fellas.

770
00:41:30,555 --> 00:41:32,922
No problem.

771
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:34,691
Nice haircut.

772
00:41:34,693 --> 00:41:37,694
And I see we've abandoned
our traditional green.

773
00:41:37,696 --> 00:41:39,062
Trying something different.

774
00:41:39,064 --> 00:41:40,463
Look...

775
00:41:40,465 --> 00:41:41,564
I might need
a favor from you.

776
00:41:41,566 --> 00:41:44,100
Wherever, whenever.

777
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:56,946
I got you.

778
00:42:23,807 --> 00:42:25,275
Greg, move your head.
