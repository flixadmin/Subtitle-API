1
00:00:01,303 --> 00:00:03,599
My name
is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,241 --> 00:00:07,242
After five years
on a hellish island,

3
00:00:07,405 --> 00:00:09,805
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:10,107 --> 00:00:12,741
to save my city.

5
00:00:12,743 --> 00:00:16,578
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,781
To honor my friend's memory,

7
00:00:19,783 --> 00:00:22,751
I must be someone else.

8
00:00:22,753 --> 00:00:26,305
I must be...something else.

9
00:00:27,757 --> 00:00:29,158
Previously on "Arrow"...

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,426
It's a hozen.

11
00:00:30,428 --> 00:00:32,845
In Buddhism,
it symbolizes reconnecting.

12
00:00:32,847 --> 00:00:36,014
And now that Malcolm's
dead, there's only one archer left.

13
00:00:36,016 --> 00:00:38,650
And I'm going to help
my boss catch him.

14
00:00:41,905 --> 00:00:44,306
Let the kid go.

15
00:00:44,308 --> 00:00:47,142
It's like you have a death wish.
And guess what?

16
00:00:47,144 --> 00:00:49,077
It's going to come true.

17
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:50,863
Yeah, well, someone
has to do something.

18
00:00:50,865 --> 00:00:53,148
Stand up for what's
right, like he did.

19
00:01:28,952 --> 00:01:31,119
Faster!

20
00:01:31,121 --> 00:01:33,705
Foot's on
the floor, man.

21
00:01:33,707 --> 00:01:36,992
Call it in.
This is FEMA truck 52.

22
00:01:36,994 --> 00:01:39,027
We're being pursued
by two armed bikers.

23
00:01:39,029 --> 00:01:42,498
We're heading south on Third Street,
requesting immediate assistance.

24
00:01:47,086 --> 00:01:49,037
Come on,
get us out of here.

25
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:50,973
Get us out of here!

26
00:02:07,223 --> 00:02:09,575
Who the hell was that?

27
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:17,125
Just so you know,

28
00:03:17,127 --> 00:03:19,461
the real bad guys
are getting away!

29
00:03:21,798 --> 00:03:25,851
♪ Headed for the open door

30
00:03:25,853 --> 00:03:30,088
♪ tell me what
you're waiting for ♪

31
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,808
♪ look across
the great divide ♪

32
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:38,664
♪ soon they're going to hear
the sound, sound, sound ♪

33
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:41,917
♪ when we come running

34
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:44,086
We're going to need
more sparring dummies.

35
00:03:44,088 --> 00:03:46,121
I'll start
ordering them in bulk.

36
00:03:46,123 --> 00:03:48,323
This mean you're ready
to launch crusade 2.0?

37
00:03:48,325 --> 00:03:50,509
I'm ready, I just
don't know where to begin.

38
00:03:50,511 --> 00:03:52,344
Last year, I had the list.

39
00:03:52,346 --> 00:03:54,496
Getting justice was as simple
as crossing names out of a book.

40
00:03:54,498 --> 00:03:56,264
This is Starling City.
You never have to look far

41
00:03:56,266 --> 00:03:59,000
to find someone engaged
in illegal activity.

42
00:03:59,002 --> 00:04:01,136
Yesterday Big Belly
Burger got robbed.

43
00:04:01,138 --> 00:04:03,472
Was Carly there? She ok?

44
00:04:03,474 --> 00:04:05,357
Yeah, she was, um,

45
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:07,842
it was her day off.

46
00:04:07,844 --> 00:04:09,444
Good. Well, the three of us
should get dinner.

47
00:04:09,446 --> 00:04:11,346
I haven't seen her
since I got back.

48
00:04:11,348 --> 00:04:13,098
Why the sudden interest
in my love life?

49
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,350
If it's important to you,
it's important to me.

50
00:04:15,352 --> 00:04:17,202
Hey! I didn't
see you come in.

51
00:04:17,204 --> 00:04:20,439
I had a secret entrance
installed when I ran the club.

52
00:04:21,691 --> 00:04:24,743
Kidding.

53
00:04:24,745 --> 00:04:27,963
Hello?

54
00:04:27,965 --> 00:04:30,632
Yes, yeah,
this is Thea Queen.

55
00:04:33,035 --> 00:04:35,887
Of course
that's where he is.

56
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:41,476
Who is he, Roy?

57
00:04:41,478 --> 00:04:43,979
I already told you,
I don't know.

58
00:04:43,981 --> 00:04:47,983
So you just happen
to have one of his arrows.

59
00:04:47,985 --> 00:04:50,352
I hear he likes
green ones.

60
00:04:50,354 --> 00:04:51,571
Do you think this is funny?

61
00:04:51,596 --> 00:04:54,336
Because I can charge you
with obstruction right now!

62
00:05:00,913 --> 00:05:03,832
Look...

63
00:05:03,834 --> 00:05:07,703
I used to feel
the same way as you.

64
00:05:07,705 --> 00:05:10,372
He has this way of...

65
00:05:10,374 --> 00:05:12,991
seducing you.

66
00:05:12,993 --> 00:05:18,213
Making you feel like
he's some kind of guardian angel.

67
00:05:18,215 --> 00:05:21,433
But he's not.

68
00:05:21,435 --> 00:05:24,102
He causes chaos
and death.

69
00:05:24,104 --> 00:05:26,087
And you trying
to emulate him

70
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:28,223
just makes
the situation worse.

71
00:05:28,225 --> 00:05:30,809
Half the city fell into a hole.

72
00:05:30,811 --> 00:05:32,978
I'd say the situation's
already worse.

73
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,063
Look, some of us
are just trying to make it better.

74
00:05:35,065 --> 00:05:37,032
Who, like you
and the Hood?

75
00:05:37,034 --> 00:05:39,501
Look, there--

76
00:05:39,503 --> 00:05:41,903
There are others.

77
00:05:41,905 --> 00:05:45,307
Others out there who are willing
to do what's right.

78
00:05:45,309 --> 00:05:48,794
I've seen them.
I've seen her.

79
00:05:48,796 --> 00:05:51,329
I'm not interested
in anyone else.

80
00:05:53,132 --> 00:05:56,001
Just him.

81
00:06:03,342 --> 00:06:06,094
What happened?

82
00:06:06,096 --> 00:06:08,129
Are you hurt?
Fender bender.

83
00:06:08,131 --> 00:06:11,316
He totaled his car
playing hood junior.

84
00:06:11,318 --> 00:06:13,101
At least
it wasn't my car.

85
00:06:13,103 --> 00:06:15,821
Don't say anything!
I already called you an attorney.

86
00:06:15,823 --> 00:06:18,356
That won't be necessary,
we're not pressing charges.

87
00:06:18,358 --> 00:06:20,158
So long as he gives up
looking for trouble.

88
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,278
Might as well
tell him to give up breathing.

89
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,247
I'll talk to him.

90
00:06:25,249 --> 00:06:28,333
Ask him if he knows
anything about the Vigilante.

91
00:06:28,335 --> 00:06:32,487
Roy has obviously forged
some sort of connection to him.

92
00:06:32,489 --> 00:06:34,122
Maybe it goes both ways.

93
00:06:34,124 --> 00:06:36,991
Doesn't sound like
the Vigilante to have a groupie.

94
00:06:36,993 --> 00:06:39,211
That's just it--
we don't know anything

95
00:06:39,213 --> 00:06:41,129
about the Vigilante.

96
00:06:41,131 --> 00:06:43,048
Except for every time
that he shows up,

97
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,800
all hell breaks loose.

98
00:06:44,802 --> 00:06:46,852
It has to stop, Ollie.

99
00:06:46,854 --> 00:06:50,188
He has to be stopped.

100
00:06:55,194 --> 00:06:57,445
Thea.

101
00:06:57,447 --> 00:07:00,115
Can you ask Mr. Diggle
to bring the car around, please?

102
00:07:01,351 --> 00:07:04,202
I'll always
think of you fondly.

103
00:07:04,204 --> 00:07:06,071
Save the speeches.

104
00:07:06,073 --> 00:07:08,373
Your ex-girlfriend
already laid one on me.

105
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,692
Still, no effect.

106
00:07:10,694 --> 00:07:12,711
I used to be
a lot like you, Roy.

107
00:07:12,713 --> 00:07:14,296
I doubt that.

108
00:07:14,298 --> 00:07:17,966
I spend more time in the back
of cop cars than limos, so...

109
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,387
The world
doesn't work anymore.

110
00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:23,493
It broke a long time ago,

111
00:07:23,518 --> 00:07:25,424
but it was like you were
the only one who noticed.

112
00:07:25,425 --> 00:07:30,011
That makes you angry.

113
00:07:30,013 --> 00:07:32,013
And you're afraid
that that anger

114
00:07:32,015 --> 00:07:33,398
is going to burn you up inside

115
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,817
if you have to live
in the world one second longer

116
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:40,054
knowing that you could
do something to fix it.

117
00:07:40,056 --> 00:07:44,109
That anger's going
to put you in the hospital, kid.

118
00:07:44,111 --> 00:07:46,444
Or worse.

119
00:07:46,446 --> 00:07:48,780
Well, I'll take worse.

120
00:07:48,782 --> 00:07:51,733
It's better to be dead than
in a hospital these days, right?

121
00:07:51,735 --> 00:07:52,834
What do you mean?

122
00:07:52,836 --> 00:07:54,920
Been to the Glades
Memorial, lately?

123
00:07:54,922 --> 00:07:57,339
No, but I didn't read
that it was damaged by the quake.

124
00:07:57,341 --> 00:07:59,073
It wasn't.

125
00:07:59,075 --> 00:08:01,009
The medicine that FEMA's been
sending the hospital

126
00:08:01,011 --> 00:08:02,127
is being hijacked.

127
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:04,095
So, if they don't
re-supply,

128
00:08:04,097 --> 00:08:06,181
they'll be forced to close.
By who?

129
00:08:06,183 --> 00:08:07,916
I don't know!

130
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:10,268
The doctors and nurses
are already bailing on the place.

131
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,954
And the cops? The cops rarely
venture that deep into the Glades,

132
00:08:12,956 --> 00:08:15,423
so I guess
that leaves only me!

133
00:08:15,425 --> 00:08:19,427
What's it take
to make you angry?

134
00:08:51,894 --> 00:08:53,311
Others will come.

135
00:08:53,313 --> 00:08:55,397
They won't be happy
we killed their men.

136
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:58,850
All the more reason
to figure out why they're here.

137
00:09:02,321 --> 00:09:04,906
It's a map.

138
00:09:04,908 --> 00:09:08,810
Of the island chain,
containing Lian Yu.

139
00:09:08,812 --> 00:09:12,197
This is similar to the recon shots
that A.S.I.S. gave me

140
00:09:12,199 --> 00:09:14,749
before I came here
to rescue your father.

141
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:20,505
Whatever they're looking for,
it must be here, on this island.

142
00:09:24,126 --> 00:09:25,994
I've seen men in war
with that look in their eyes.

143
00:09:25,996 --> 00:09:28,680
What look?

144
00:09:28,682 --> 00:09:32,183
The one that says
he's split into someone else.

145
00:09:32,185 --> 00:09:36,054
Someone
he doesn't even recognize.

146
00:09:36,056 --> 00:09:39,941
If someone doesn't
talk to him, it'll tear him up.

147
00:09:52,705 --> 00:09:54,739
Come on.

148
00:09:54,741 --> 00:09:57,075
Let's get away
from this place.

149
00:10:04,701 --> 00:10:07,168
They survived the quake
and ended up here.

150
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:09,220
From one hell
to the next.

151
00:10:09,222 --> 00:10:12,674
Yeah, whoever's stealing from here,
they won't be for much longer.

152
00:10:15,311 --> 00:10:17,395
This city is failing
on all accounts.

153
00:10:17,397 --> 00:10:19,681
Who's that in the spotlight?

154
00:10:19,683 --> 00:10:23,268
Sebastian Blood, the local alderman
that I told you about.

155
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,887
Not too shy about
sharing his opinions.

156
00:10:25,889 --> 00:10:27,221
Which are?

157
00:10:27,223 --> 00:10:29,390
Which are that the Glades
have been abandoned.

158
00:10:29,392 --> 00:10:31,893
And no one gives a damn
about these people.

159
00:10:31,895 --> 00:10:33,328
He hasn't met us yet.

160
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,246
We cannot stand by
while the doctors

161
00:10:35,248 --> 00:10:37,499
on the other side
of those doors are working with

162
00:10:37,501 --> 00:10:38,900
the bare minimum
of resources

163
00:10:38,902 --> 00:10:39,951
because the police
department

164
00:10:39,953 --> 00:10:41,402
already sees us
as a lost cause.

165
00:10:41,404 --> 00:10:44,456
Meanwhile, thieves are seeking to
make a quick buck

166
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:47,292
off the misery
of the Glades.

167
00:10:47,294 --> 00:10:50,929
Oliver Queen,
isn't it?

168
00:10:50,931 --> 00:10:53,181
Alderman.

169
00:10:53,183 --> 00:10:56,885
What brings you to Glades Memorial,
Mr. Queen?

170
00:10:56,887 --> 00:10:58,720
I assume someone
of your means

171
00:10:58,722 --> 00:11:00,772
can afford the best
medical treatment money can buy.

172
00:11:00,774 --> 00:11:03,191
And I can assure you,
you're not going to find that here.

173
00:11:03,193 --> 00:11:05,193
That's wrong, sir.

174
00:11:05,195 --> 00:11:07,312
The people of the Glades have
suffered too much

175
00:11:07,314 --> 00:11:10,264
not to have access to basic
medical services.

176
00:11:10,266 --> 00:11:12,367
Well, that's very
compassionate of you to say.

177
00:11:12,369 --> 00:11:14,161
Although I wonder

178
00:11:14,186 --> 00:11:16,122
where your family's concern
for its fellow citizens was

179
00:11:16,123 --> 00:11:17,989
when they ordered
the construction

180
00:11:17,991 --> 00:11:20,291
of the earthquake machine
that killed 503 people.

181
00:11:22,445 --> 00:11:24,162
Ladies and gentlemen,
ladies and gentlemen, please!

182
00:11:24,164 --> 00:11:25,997
I will be doing
everything in my power

183
00:11:25,999 --> 00:11:28,466
to atone for my family's
culpability in this tragedy.

184
00:11:28,468 --> 00:11:30,919
Well, I'm sure the people of
the Glades that I represent

185
00:11:30,921 --> 00:11:32,470
will sleep better
knowing that--

186
00:11:32,472 --> 00:11:34,422
if they still had
a place to sleep.

187
00:11:34,424 --> 00:11:36,925
If their homes
hadn't crumbled around them.

188
00:11:36,927 --> 00:11:40,228
If their stores and their businesses
hadn't been condemned.

189
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,346
You did this to us!

190
00:11:41,348 --> 00:11:43,014
Go back to your mansion,
rich boy!

191
00:11:43,016 --> 00:11:45,817
Spare us your mercy
visits, Queen!

192
00:11:45,819 --> 00:11:48,186
You've done enough
for this city already.

193
00:11:48,188 --> 00:11:49,470
Excuse us.
Pardon us.

194
00:12:03,575 --> 00:12:07,575

196
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,804
I quit.

197
00:12:14,806 --> 00:12:16,672
No, you don't.
Yes, I do.

198
00:12:16,674 --> 00:12:18,357
Not my old job in
the I.T. Department,

199
00:12:18,359 --> 00:12:20,643
but my new job
as your executive assistant,

200
00:12:20,645 --> 00:12:22,511
which you think
I'm going to accept.

201
00:12:22,513 --> 00:12:25,481
Your thinking could not be
more wrong in this matter.

202
00:12:25,483 --> 00:12:27,783
I need a girl Wednesday.
It's...Friday,

203
00:12:27,785 --> 00:12:30,286
and the answer is no!

204
00:12:32,072 --> 00:12:34,073
These computers
have been upgraded.

205
00:12:34,075 --> 00:12:37,660
Far more processing power
than your typical secretary.

206
00:12:37,662 --> 00:12:39,662
Did you know
I went to M.I.T.?

207
00:12:39,664 --> 00:12:41,414
Guess what
I majored in. Hint--

208
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:42,865
not the secretarial arts.

209
00:12:42,867 --> 00:12:44,133
Felicity!

210
00:12:44,135 --> 00:12:46,168
We all need to have
secret identities now.

211
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:48,721
If I'm going to be
Oliver Queen CEO,

212
00:12:48,723 --> 00:12:51,507
then I can't very well
travel down 18 floors

213
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:54,093
every time you and I need to discuss
how we spend our nights.

214
00:12:54,095 --> 00:12:56,545
And I love spending
the night with you.

215
00:12:56,547 --> 00:12:59,015
3, 2, 1.

216
00:12:59,017 --> 00:13:01,150
I worked very hard
to get where I am,

217
00:13:01,152 --> 00:13:03,402
and it wasn't
so I could fetch you coffee!

218
00:13:03,404 --> 00:13:05,438
Well, it could be worse...

219
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,774
My secret identity
is his black driver.

220
00:13:10,077 --> 00:13:11,944
Right now...

221
00:13:11,946 --> 00:13:13,729
I need you to figure out
how the hijackers

222
00:13:13,731 --> 00:13:14,728
are getting a line

223
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:16,959
on the goods earmarked
for Glades Memorial.

224
00:13:17,702 --> 00:13:20,069
If we know how
they're picking their targets...

225
00:13:20,071 --> 00:13:23,589
We will know when
and where to stop them.

226
00:13:23,591 --> 00:13:26,042
Fine.

227
00:13:26,044 --> 00:13:27,793
Oh!

228
00:13:27,795 --> 00:13:29,679
May I get you
a cup of coffee?

229
00:13:31,633 --> 00:13:33,966
You're not actually offering to get me
a cup of coffee, are you?

230
00:13:33,968 --> 00:13:35,718
Yeah, no.

231
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,754
That won't be
happening. Ever!

232
00:13:38,756 --> 00:13:40,389
Well, if you can
bring yourself to do it,

233
00:13:40,391 --> 00:13:42,558
can you please make reservations
for Dig, Carly and I

234
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,760
Saturday night at Table Salt?

235
00:13:44,762 --> 00:13:46,862
Sure!

236
00:13:46,864 --> 00:13:49,865
I'll get right on that.
Using the Internet,

237
00:13:49,867 --> 00:13:53,069
which you also happen
to have access to.

238
00:13:54,872 --> 00:13:56,572
Still haven't told him?

239
00:13:56,574 --> 00:13:58,607
He has enough
on his plate.

240
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,965
Last year when Oliver Queen
returned to Starling City,

241
00:14:05,967 --> 00:14:08,117
he was met with flowers
and well-wishes.

242
00:14:08,119 --> 00:14:10,386
However, today down
at Glades Memorial,

243
00:14:10,388 --> 00:14:12,855
he was met with a far less
cordial homecoming.

244
00:14:12,857 --> 00:14:16,125
The question is no longer,
where have you been, Oliver Queen.

245
00:14:16,127 --> 00:14:18,794
Now it's, but what
have you done for me lately?

246
00:14:18,796 --> 00:14:21,230
Mr. Queen was not
available for comment.

247
00:14:31,074 --> 00:14:34,660
You saved my life.

248
00:14:34,662 --> 00:14:38,998
That's what I keep
telling myself.

249
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,918
That I killed that guy because
he was going to kill you.

250
00:14:45,038 --> 00:14:47,707
But what if that's
not the reason?

251
00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:52,494
I just feel like
this island is...

252
00:14:52,496 --> 00:14:56,716
It's turning me into
something terrible.

253
00:15:07,861 --> 00:15:11,030
No island, no place

254
00:15:11,032 --> 00:15:13,616
can make you
something you're not.

255
00:15:13,618 --> 00:15:17,119
So I've always
been a killer?

256
00:15:20,373 --> 00:15:24,710
Everyone has a demon
inside of them.

257
00:15:24,712 --> 00:15:28,547
The "dao de jing" recognizes

258
00:15:28,549 --> 00:15:30,549
the yin and the yang.

259
00:15:30,551 --> 00:15:34,503
Opposing forces
inside all of us.

260
00:15:34,505 --> 00:15:37,539
The darkness.

261
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:40,142
And the light.

262
00:15:40,144 --> 00:15:43,729
The killer...

263
00:15:43,731 --> 00:15:46,182
and the hero.

264
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,109
Never thought I'd say this,
but I'm actually

265
00:16:13,111 --> 00:16:15,077
getting more done
down in the basement

266
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:16,762
of an abandoned steel factory
than in the corner office of a high rise.

267
00:16:16,764 --> 00:16:18,547
What do you have?

268
00:16:18,549 --> 00:16:20,933
FEMA is shipping 100,000 units
of medical grade opiates

269
00:16:20,935 --> 00:16:22,852
to Glades Memorial.
When?

270
00:16:22,854 --> 00:16:25,554
Truck is scheduled to leave
the FEMA depot in 20 minutes.

271
00:16:25,556 --> 00:16:27,139
Not if this motorcycle gang
has anything to say about it.

272
00:16:27,141 --> 00:16:28,974
Bad luck for them.

273
00:16:28,976 --> 00:16:31,227
I have something
to say about it.

274
00:16:50,914 --> 00:16:54,083
No, no, no, please,
please, don't shoot.

275
00:16:54,085 --> 00:16:56,451
Down!

276
00:16:59,556 --> 00:17:00,956
Make your delivery!

277
00:17:07,931 --> 00:17:10,632
Emerald archer.

278
00:17:10,634 --> 00:17:12,768
I feared you had
perished in the quake,

279
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:15,938
denying me the opportunity
to pay you back in full

280
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,691
for your past interference
in my business.

281
00:17:18,693 --> 00:17:21,911
Your business is going under--
permanently!

282
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,949
I don't think my friend
agrees with you.

283
00:17:26,951 --> 00:17:29,535
Our new partnership
was easily cemented.

284
00:17:29,537 --> 00:17:31,153
See, I was eager
to see you dead,

285
00:17:31,155 --> 00:17:33,923
and he was eager
to kill you.

286
00:17:39,546 --> 00:17:41,830
No kill shots?

287
00:17:41,832 --> 00:17:43,599
I was promised a fight.

288
00:17:43,601 --> 00:17:45,301
I hope you haven't
lost your nerve.

289
00:17:45,303 --> 00:17:46,969
Find out.

290
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:09,074
Starling City police!
You're surrounded.

291
00:18:09,076 --> 00:18:11,327
Put down your weapons
or we will open fire.

292
00:18:28,845 --> 00:18:30,879
Cease fire, cease fire!

293
00:18:30,881 --> 00:18:33,382
Find them.

294
00:18:55,656 --> 00:18:58,091
Does it hurt?

295
00:18:58,093 --> 00:19:00,343
Not as much as some things.

296
00:19:00,345 --> 00:19:01,795
I love that we live in
a city where the police

297
00:19:01,797 --> 00:19:03,013
are more interested
in catching you

298
00:19:03,015 --> 00:19:05,265
than the drug-stealing
mobsters.

299
00:19:05,267 --> 00:19:07,500
Our tax dollars at work.

300
00:19:07,502 --> 00:19:09,769
The authorities have always
gone after the Vigilante.

301
00:19:09,771 --> 00:19:12,022
This time was different.

302
00:19:12,024 --> 00:19:14,340
Why, because this
time it's Laurel leading the charge?

303
00:19:14,342 --> 00:19:17,193
Because they got in my way.

304
00:19:17,195 --> 00:19:21,114
I can't make things better
as Oliver Queen,

305
00:19:21,116 --> 00:19:23,349
and now I can't make things
better as the Vigilante.

306
00:19:23,351 --> 00:19:26,019
So what if Laurel's involved?

307
00:19:26,021 --> 00:19:27,822
Hey! Go easy on him.
It's all right, Felicity.

308
00:19:27,823 --> 00:19:28,784
No, it's not.

309
00:19:28,809 --> 00:19:30,291
You don't get to
jump down his throat

310
00:19:30,292 --> 00:19:32,242
just because you happen to be
having a lousy week.

311
00:19:32,244 --> 00:19:34,878
Ok, you're pissed
he invoked the almighty Laurel.

312
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,579
Well, you're not
the only one whose love life

313
00:19:36,581 --> 00:19:38,081
is taking it on the chin!
Felicity...

314
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,717
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about,

315
00:19:40,719 --> 00:19:42,002
you keep
bringing up Carly

316
00:19:42,004 --> 00:19:43,887
but you're so involved
with yourself

317
00:19:43,889 --> 00:19:46,369
that you don't even realize the
look he gets every time you do.

318
00:19:47,224 --> 00:19:49,976
What is she talking about?

319
00:19:49,978 --> 00:19:51,828
Me and Carly
pulling the pin.

320
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:54,781
It happened when
you were gone.

321
00:19:54,783 --> 00:19:56,733
Truth is, it's been happening
for a while now.

322
00:19:56,735 --> 00:19:59,602
Being the Vigilante's
wingman was a strain.

323
00:19:59,604 --> 00:20:02,889
He needs to hear this.

324
00:20:02,891 --> 00:20:05,992
This wasn't just about
what we were doing, Oliver.

325
00:20:05,994 --> 00:20:08,745
This isn't
just about you, man.

326
00:20:08,747 --> 00:20:13,083
I couldn't separate what's going
on with me and Carly, and...

327
00:20:13,085 --> 00:20:15,151
What went on
with my brother.

328
00:20:15,153 --> 00:20:16,736
Deadshot.

329
00:20:16,738 --> 00:20:18,738
He's still out there.

330
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:22,241
My brother's killer.
Still breathing.

331
00:20:22,243 --> 00:20:24,177
And I, uh,

332
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:25,879
guess I couldn't
hate him

333
00:20:25,881 --> 00:20:28,264
and love her
at the same time.

334
00:20:29,717 --> 00:20:31,217
See?

335
00:20:31,219 --> 00:20:34,637
You are not
the only one

336
00:20:34,639 --> 00:20:37,557
having trouble reconciling two
sides of himself.

337
00:20:58,662 --> 00:21:00,947
Great crowd tonight.

338
00:21:00,949 --> 00:21:02,158
Now that we're closed,

339
00:21:02,183 --> 00:21:04,024
are you going to be
starting your second shift?

340
00:21:04,669 --> 00:21:06,285
Suicide by Chinese
street thugs.

341
00:21:06,287 --> 00:21:09,005
Do you really want
to talk about this again?

342
00:21:09,007 --> 00:21:10,723
We never finished
talking about it.

343
00:21:10,725 --> 00:21:14,027
I wanted Laurel
to arrest you.

344
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:18,587
You know,

345
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:20,612
you're not the first
girlfriend to say that to me.

346
00:21:21,069 --> 00:21:23,603
She said I couldn't
change you,

347
00:21:23,605 --> 00:21:25,572
so I'm not going
to try to.

348
00:21:29,994 --> 00:21:32,662
What, so you're giving me
money and a rock?

349
00:21:32,664 --> 00:21:34,330
The check is two weeks'
severance from the club.

350
00:21:34,332 --> 00:21:36,649
Just because
I can't change you

351
00:21:36,651 --> 00:21:38,668
doesn't mean I have to let you
be in my life

352
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,954
until you get
yourself killed.

353
00:21:43,175 --> 00:21:45,675
And my brother gave me that when
he came back from the dead.

354
00:21:45,677 --> 00:21:48,761
He said it was a hozen,

355
00:21:48,763 --> 00:21:52,832
some Buddhist thing that
symbolizes reconnecting.

356
00:21:52,834 --> 00:21:55,001
If you want
to reconnect with me,

357
00:21:55,003 --> 00:21:58,721
keep the hozen
and tear up that check.

358
00:21:58,723 --> 00:22:00,223
I don't do too well
with ultimatums.

359
00:22:00,225 --> 00:22:02,942
And I don't do
all that great

360
00:22:02,944 --> 00:22:05,145
with people I love
getting hurt.

361
00:22:05,147 --> 00:22:07,313
And worse.

362
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:18,097
Your 4:00 is here.

363
00:22:18,099 --> 00:22:19,665
Although I'm not
entirely sure

364
00:22:19,667 --> 00:22:21,501
why you invited him
up to your office.

365
00:22:21,503 --> 00:22:23,336
'Cause I need to fix
this situation,

366
00:22:23,338 --> 00:22:24,971
and there are no
cameras or people

367
00:22:24,973 --> 00:22:26,973
to throw things
at me in here.

368
00:22:26,975 --> 00:22:29,675
Alderman.
Thank you for coming.

369
00:22:29,677 --> 00:22:31,394
Mr. Queen.

370
00:22:31,396 --> 00:22:33,530
This is some view.

371
00:22:33,532 --> 00:22:36,682
How small the rest
of us must all look from up here.

372
00:22:36,684 --> 00:22:38,651
Ms. Smoak.
Yes?

373
00:22:38,653 --> 00:22:41,237
Would you get my guest
and I some coffee?

374
00:22:41,239 --> 00:22:42,688
You know, I would, Mr. Queen,

375
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:45,525
but it seems that someone's
broken our coffeemaker.

376
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:49,028
Violently.

377
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:51,297
I was surprised
that you wanted to meet.

378
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:53,917
As surprised as I was

379
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,202
when you turned
a frenzied mob on me?

380
00:22:56,204 --> 00:22:58,388
Oh, that shouldn't have
been too surprising.

381
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:01,724
My constituents have
a lot of anger towards your family.

382
00:23:01,726 --> 00:23:03,259
They have a right to.

383
00:23:03,261 --> 00:23:05,512
My mother was involved
in something...

384
00:23:05,514 --> 00:23:07,480
Unspeakable.

385
00:23:07,482 --> 00:23:09,599
But I'm my own man.

386
00:23:09,601 --> 00:23:11,985
And I'm not your enemy.

387
00:23:11,987 --> 00:23:14,020
You're not a friend.

388
00:23:14,022 --> 00:23:16,072
To me, or the people
of the Glades.

389
00:23:16,074 --> 00:23:20,660
I am hoping to prove otherwise.

390
00:23:20,662 --> 00:23:22,362
Mr. Queen.

391
00:23:22,364 --> 00:23:25,064
Not every problem
can be solved by money.

392
00:23:25,066 --> 00:23:28,034
Real change
will never happen

393
00:23:28,036 --> 00:23:30,119
until your elitist
friends realize

394
00:23:30,121 --> 00:23:31,504
that it is morally
unacceptable

395
00:23:31,506 --> 00:23:33,406
to allow thousands
of its fellow citizens

396
00:23:33,408 --> 00:23:35,675
to live right down
the street but in a third world.

397
00:23:35,677 --> 00:23:39,279
Then let's show them.
I'll host a benefit.

398
00:23:39,281 --> 00:23:41,464
Invite some
of my "elitist friends,"

399
00:23:41,466 --> 00:23:44,467
and then you and I can help them
see what needs to be done.

400
00:23:46,604 --> 00:23:49,355
People seeing you...

401
00:23:49,357 --> 00:23:51,190
Seeing you stand up,

402
00:23:51,192 --> 00:23:54,644
the CEO of Queen
Consolidated,

403
00:23:54,646 --> 00:23:58,798
taking responsibility and
being this cause's public face.

404
00:24:01,268 --> 00:24:04,654
That would
make a difference.

405
00:24:07,575 --> 00:24:09,709
Then let's make a difference.

406
00:24:13,581 --> 00:24:15,548
Listen.

407
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:19,469
I am truly sorry for what happened
outside that hospital.

408
00:24:19,471 --> 00:24:22,839
Sometimes my emotions
get the better of me.

409
00:24:29,931 --> 00:24:32,965
I don't even know how
long it's been since I laughed.

410
00:24:49,416 --> 00:24:51,651
Hey, kid.

411
00:24:51,653 --> 00:24:53,086
Shado.

412
00:24:53,088 --> 00:24:56,255
Yeah, just, um...

413
00:24:56,257 --> 00:24:59,492
We were just
washing off.

414
00:25:01,178 --> 00:25:03,262
Well, you better prepare
to get dirty again.

415
00:25:03,264 --> 00:25:06,132
I think I figured out
where those men were headed.

416
00:25:06,134 --> 00:25:08,167
It's a couple of clicks
northwest of here.

417
00:25:09,937 --> 00:25:11,837
Well, let's go.

418
00:25:15,893 --> 00:25:17,860
Be careful.

419
00:25:17,862 --> 00:25:20,313
Don't fall too hard.
Why not?

420
00:25:20,315 --> 00:25:23,533
To make sure there isn't part of
this island that doesn't totally suck?

421
00:25:23,535 --> 00:25:25,952
To survive.

422
00:25:25,954 --> 00:25:28,905
She's a distraction,
and in a place like this,

423
00:25:28,907 --> 00:25:30,957
a distraction's going
to cloud your judgment.

424
00:25:30,959 --> 00:25:34,193
And that is what's going
to get you killed.

425
00:25:34,195 --> 00:25:38,081
Look at what this island has
already done to you, kid.

426
00:25:52,563 --> 00:25:55,398
Hello, Laurel.

427
00:25:56,717 --> 00:25:58,685
This seems like
old times.

428
00:25:58,687 --> 00:26:01,554
I figured we should talk.

429
00:26:01,556 --> 00:26:03,322
Fine.

430
00:26:03,324 --> 00:26:06,075
Turn that thing off
and pull back your hood.

431
00:26:06,077 --> 00:26:07,560
I'm not your enemy.

432
00:26:07,562 --> 00:26:09,612
And I thought we understood
each other.

433
00:26:09,614 --> 00:26:11,514
I understand that
you're a criminal.

434
00:26:11,516 --> 00:26:13,466
And you think the law
doesn't apply to you-- it does.

435
00:26:13,468 --> 00:26:16,018
But you didn't always
feel that way.

436
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:19,622
You used to think that I was helping
the people in this city.

437
00:26:19,624 --> 00:26:22,925
And then I saw you.

438
00:26:22,927 --> 00:26:25,211
I don't understand.

439
00:26:25,213 --> 00:26:26,629
The night
of the earthquake.

440
00:26:26,631 --> 00:26:29,031
I saw you at CNRI.

441
00:26:29,033 --> 00:26:32,935
My friend was
inside the building

442
00:26:32,937 --> 00:26:35,054
when it collapsed.

443
00:26:35,056 --> 00:26:37,940
He went there
to rescue me.

444
00:26:37,942 --> 00:26:41,194
And by the time I managed
to climb inside, he was gone.

445
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:45,248
But I saw you.

446
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:49,035
Running away
into the night.

447
00:26:49,037 --> 00:26:51,654
You didn't save him.

448
00:26:58,195 --> 00:27:00,496
You were too busy...

449
00:27:00,498 --> 00:27:03,583
Fighting a meaningless duel
with Malcolm Merlyn.

450
00:27:03,585 --> 00:27:05,618
And when people--

451
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:09,672
people you told me you would
protect needed your help...

452
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:15,511
You weren't there.

453
00:27:17,147 --> 00:27:21,150
I don't think you wear
that hood because you're a hero.

454
00:27:21,152 --> 00:27:24,320
I think you wear it
to hide that you're a coward,

455
00:27:24,322 --> 00:27:27,490
and I promise you,
I will see you unmasked,

456
00:27:27,492 --> 00:27:31,077
prosecuted
and sent to prison.

457
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:33,696
Don't ever speak
to me again.

458
00:28:02,397 --> 00:28:05,199
You look like a woman
who's looking for someone.

459
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:10,421
Friend of mine.
He's throwing this benefit.

460
00:28:10,423 --> 00:28:12,439
Ah. Oliver Queen.

461
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:14,089
Didn't realize
you were friends.

462
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:15,679
Very old friends.

463
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,401
So you can imagine how I feel
about you putting him in the crosshairs

464
00:28:19,515 --> 00:28:21,899
of public opinion,
alderman.

465
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,651
For what it's worth,
I've apologized to Oliver

466
00:28:24,653 --> 00:28:26,236
for my rhetorical excesses.

467
00:28:26,238 --> 00:28:28,205
In fact, it is that détente

468
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:30,874
which brings us
all here tonight.

469
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:33,126
So where is Oliver?

470
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:36,863
That's exactly the question
I'm asking myself.

471
00:28:38,916 --> 00:28:41,551
We're late.

472
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:44,087
The good news is,  at least you
get to make a dramatic entrance.

473
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:46,273
Oh, I'm just lucky
Oliver Queen

474
00:28:46,275 --> 00:28:49,176
has a reputation for not
showing up on time.

475
00:28:49,178 --> 00:28:50,644
You know, I've been
meaning to tell you

476
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:52,245
it really
weirds me out to no end

477
00:28:52,247 --> 00:28:54,714
the way you refer to yourself
in the third person like that.

478
00:28:57,352 --> 00:29:00,187
It's Felicity.

479
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:03,323
Tell me.

480
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:05,725
I've got
good news and bad news.

481
00:29:05,727 --> 00:29:07,060
I hacked into FEMA's server,

482
00:29:07,062 --> 00:29:08,945
yet another federal offense,
thank you very much,

483
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:10,914
and was able to find out
when the next shipment

484
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,115
of pharmaceuticals
is taking place.

485
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:14,534
When?
That's the bad news.

486
00:29:14,536 --> 00:29:16,569
Five minutes ago.

487
00:29:16,571 --> 00:29:20,123
I know this is the definition
of sucky timing,

488
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:23,243
but...which suit are you

489
00:29:23,245 --> 00:29:25,845
planning on wearing tonight?

490
00:29:27,048 --> 00:29:29,966
Doesn't seem Mr. Queen
is going to honor us

491
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:33,103
with his presence
this evening.

492
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:35,772
So where are you going?

493
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,058
To address his guests.

494
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:41,645
It's time they realize
what kind of a man their host is.

495
00:29:41,647 --> 00:29:44,064
You're just going to crucify him
in the media again?

496
00:29:44,066 --> 00:29:48,935
Crucifixion has such...
A bad reputation.

497
00:29:48,937 --> 00:29:51,604
The Romans used it
to punish people

498
00:29:51,606 --> 00:29:54,324
who acted against
the public good.

499
00:29:54,326 --> 00:29:57,210
Alderman...

500
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,879
Ladies and gentlemen.

501
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,665
Thank you.

502
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:05,552
Thank you. But you should hold
your applause for Oliver Queen.

503
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:07,254
This evening's charity
was his brain child.

504
00:30:08,256 --> 00:30:11,124
As such,

505
00:30:11,126 --> 00:30:12,976
you could be forgiven
for wondering why

506
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:16,629
Mr. Queen isn't
with us tonight.

507
00:30:16,631 --> 00:30:19,232
And the answer, I'm afraid,

508
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:22,302
is painfully apparent.

509
00:30:22,304 --> 00:30:24,304
He doesn't care.

510
00:30:24,306 --> 00:30:26,990
I told Mr. Queen
that this city's

511
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:30,143
problems cannot be
solved with his money;

512
00:30:30,145 --> 00:30:31,644
that he needed
to stand up

513
00:30:31,646 --> 00:30:33,697
and be counted
as someone who cares.

514
00:30:33,699 --> 00:30:35,582
So where is he now?
Lieutenant!

515
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:38,668
We got a Hood sighting,
heading down Lemire Avenue.

516
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,170
Let's go!

517
00:30:42,673 --> 00:30:46,159
I don't know where
Oliver Queen is.

518
00:30:46,161 --> 00:30:50,096
All I know is that
he isn't here.

519
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:53,183
This city is dying.

520
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:54,851
And it needs
someone to stand up

521
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,369
and breathe
new hope into it.

522
00:30:56,371 --> 00:30:59,356
And tonight, it is
painfully obvious

523
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:02,442
that that person
is not Oliver Queen.

524
00:31:22,997 --> 00:31:25,215
Go!

525
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:28,501
I told you.
On time to die.

526
00:31:45,738 --> 00:31:48,039
This doesn't make any sense.

527
00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:51,376
This is supposed to be
live surveillance.

528
00:31:51,378 --> 00:31:53,378
What the hell is this
building doing here?

529
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,130
It was destroyed
in the quake.

530
00:31:55,132 --> 00:31:59,084
Who in the hell could be feeding
us year-old surveillance?

531
00:32:12,481 --> 00:32:16,318
Healthcare has enough problems
without you punks.

532
00:32:27,697 --> 00:32:31,566
You're not the only one
allowed to bring a friend!

533
00:32:40,076 --> 00:32:42,844
I'm clear.

534
00:32:46,916 --> 00:32:50,101
That makes one of us.

535
00:33:17,963 --> 00:33:21,082
China!

536
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:30,508
Aaah!

537
00:33:42,071 --> 00:33:44,138
Ahh.

538
00:33:52,832 --> 00:33:55,867
Go ahead,
waste your arrows.

539
00:33:55,869 --> 00:33:58,119
Aah!

540
00:33:58,121 --> 00:34:00,422
That hurt,
but it won't stop me.

541
00:34:06,095 --> 00:34:09,047
That will.

542
00:34:09,049 --> 00:34:11,883
Dig?

543
00:34:11,885 --> 00:34:14,269
Diggle!

544
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:42,914
You've changed.

545
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,552
You would have killed me
by now if you hadn't.

546
00:34:47,554 --> 00:34:50,538
The police can take the shipment
the rest of the way.

547
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:54,843
They still won't see you as anything
more than the enemy.

548
00:34:58,898 --> 00:35:02,767
You'll never be anything
but a criminal to them.

549
00:35:04,052 --> 00:35:06,721
Which means
you'll never be a hero.

550
00:35:06,723 --> 00:35:09,574
As long as
this city is safe,

551
00:35:09,576 --> 00:35:11,943
it doesn't matter.

552
00:35:11,945 --> 00:35:14,846
Those sirens
aren't for you.

553
00:35:20,404 --> 00:35:21,988
After
a prolonged pursuit,

554
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:23,907
police have arrested
Chien Na Wei,

555
00:35:23,909 --> 00:35:26,693
a high-ranking member
of the local Chinese Triad,

556
00:35:26,695 --> 00:35:29,045
which was responsible
for the recent hijackings

557
00:35:29,047 --> 00:35:31,631
of pharmaceuticals
bound for Glades Memorial.

558
00:35:31,633 --> 00:35:34,617
Representatives praise
the efforts of the SCPD

559
00:35:34,619 --> 00:35:37,337
in saving the hospital
from shutting down,

560
00:35:37,339 --> 00:35:41,424
though some sources say the
Vigilante may have been involved.

561
00:35:41,426 --> 00:35:43,693
In other news,
protests continue in...

562
00:35:43,695 --> 00:35:45,595
I was just about to
make my move on her.

563
00:35:45,597 --> 00:35:48,431
I didn't need one of your trick arrows
getting in the way.

564
00:35:48,433 --> 00:35:50,567
Couldn't risk it.

565
00:35:50,569 --> 00:35:53,069
Where would I be
without my black driver?

566
00:35:54,605 --> 00:35:56,890
Diggle!

567
00:35:56,892 --> 00:36:00,743
I'm sorry
about you and Carly.

568
00:36:02,513 --> 00:36:05,031
Yeah, well,
couples break up.

569
00:36:05,033 --> 00:36:08,067
Not everything that
happens in Starling City

570
00:36:08,069 --> 00:36:09,669
is your responsibility.

571
00:36:09,671 --> 00:36:11,504
I'm learning that.

572
00:36:11,506 --> 00:36:12,956
What I meant was,

573
00:36:12,958 --> 00:36:14,924
I'm sorry that
I wasn't there for you,

574
00:36:14,926 --> 00:36:16,843
because I should
have been.

575
00:36:16,845 --> 00:36:18,912
I got wrapped up
in my own suffering,

576
00:36:18,914 --> 00:36:22,382
and I...forgot that
some other people

577
00:36:22,384 --> 00:36:24,250
might be
suffering, too.

578
00:36:26,937 --> 00:36:30,440
You know, we're getting
dangerously close to hug territory,

579
00:36:30,442 --> 00:36:33,042
so I'm going to fall back.
You need a ride?

580
00:36:33,044 --> 00:36:36,563
It turns that being CEO,
I actually have

581
00:36:36,565 --> 00:36:37,997
some work to do.

582
00:36:37,999 --> 00:36:39,866
I'll find my own way.

583
00:36:39,868 --> 00:36:43,636
You always do.

584
00:36:48,942 --> 00:36:51,878
Oliver Queen's
failure to show up to his own benefit

585
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,880
shouldn't surprise anyone.

586
00:36:53,882 --> 00:36:57,317
He's no different than the rest of
the Starling City elite

587
00:36:57,319 --> 00:36:59,669
who have failed to show up when
it comes to ending the suffering

588
00:36:59,671 --> 00:37:02,372
of those left devastated
in the Glades.

589
00:37:02,374 --> 00:37:05,058
Oliver Queen is not a friend

590
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:07,026
to the people of this city.

591
00:37:34,922 --> 00:37:38,925
To those men, this location
could have been

592
00:37:38,927 --> 00:37:40,927
on any one of 150
different islands.

593
00:37:40,929 --> 00:37:44,797
But for somebody who knows
this island like he knows his own name...

594
00:37:44,799 --> 00:37:46,849
So those men were
looking for this place.

595
00:37:46,851 --> 00:37:48,768
Why?

596
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:51,554
- That would be the question.
- Slade.

597
00:37:51,556 --> 00:37:53,973
Over here.

598
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:31,477
What happened to these people?

599
00:38:34,982 --> 00:38:37,883
Whatever did happen to them
was over 60 years ago.

600
00:38:37,885 --> 00:38:42,605
These soldiers belong
to the Japanese Imperial Army.

601
00:38:42,607 --> 00:38:45,825
They've been here
since World War II.

602
00:38:47,611 --> 00:38:49,662
We're missing
something here.

603
00:38:49,664 --> 00:38:52,615
You don't just
come here for corpses.

604
00:39:21,461 --> 00:39:23,445
I've been looking for you.

605
00:39:23,447 --> 00:39:24,896
You need to stop.

606
00:39:24,898 --> 00:39:27,449
You saved my life!

607
00:39:27,451 --> 00:39:30,285
Made me realize it...

608
00:39:30,287 --> 00:39:32,404
wasn't much of a life.

609
00:39:32,406 --> 00:39:35,907
But I could do
what others couldn't,

610
00:39:35,909 --> 00:39:39,277
or too afraid to do.

611
00:39:39,279 --> 00:39:41,713
I could help you
save the city.

612
00:39:41,715 --> 00:39:43,048
You're untrained.
I can fight.

613
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:45,467
You can take a beating.

614
00:39:45,469 --> 00:39:46,918
There's a difference.

615
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,087
Then teach me!

616
00:39:49,089 --> 00:39:51,590
Let me help you.

617
00:39:51,592 --> 00:39:53,558
Ok.

618
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,060
You can help me.

619
00:39:55,062 --> 00:39:59,347
But not by taking on
the Triad or the cops.

620
00:39:59,349 --> 00:40:01,016
Then how?

621
00:40:01,018 --> 00:40:03,018
To do what I do,
I need intel.

622
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:06,822
You can be my eyes
and ears in the Glades.

623
00:40:06,824 --> 00:40:09,357
That's how you
can save the city.

624
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,193
How do I contact you?

625
00:40:13,663 --> 00:40:17,499
Leave that
in the alley wall.

626
00:40:17,501 --> 00:40:19,618
Then I'll know
to contact you.

627
00:40:24,674 --> 00:40:27,292
Are you sure it's all right
that I keep this?

628
00:40:36,669 --> 00:40:40,055
If I want to be with you,
do I keep that or give it back?

629
00:40:40,057 --> 00:40:41,940
You were a little unclear.

630
00:40:41,942 --> 00:40:45,477
You mean it?
No more fighting.

631
00:40:45,479 --> 00:40:47,512
If it's a choice
between life with you

632
00:40:47,514 --> 00:40:49,347
or life without you,

633
00:40:49,349 --> 00:40:52,734
life with you will win
every single time.

634
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:55,954
I'm done trying
to be a hero.

635
00:41:15,641 --> 00:41:18,927
I told you
to stay away from me.

636
00:41:18,929 --> 00:41:21,813
I thought you might have
changed your mind

637
00:41:21,815 --> 00:41:24,549
after I stopped the men
terrorizing our city.

638
00:41:24,551 --> 00:41:27,519
This isn't your city.
It's your killing fields.

639
00:41:27,521 --> 00:41:29,571
The copycats are still alive.

640
00:41:29,573 --> 00:41:31,122
Tommy Merlyn isn't.

641
00:41:31,124 --> 00:41:34,559
I lost a friend that day, too.

642
00:41:34,561 --> 00:41:37,896
And I would gladly

643
00:41:37,898 --> 00:41:40,615
have given my life for his.

644
00:41:40,617 --> 00:41:42,951
Well, don't worry,
your life is over.

645
00:41:42,953 --> 00:41:45,871
Your life as a free man.

646
00:41:52,929 --> 00:41:55,597
I told you to stay away.

647
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:58,633
Somehow I knew
you wouldn't listen.

648
