So we'd fight and I'd put a hole in them.

And then I'd feel terrible,

And she'd fuck him, don't you think?

The way she looks at him.

198
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:34,226
The way all women look at him
is frankly irritating.

I preferred working with the little brother
on that account.

Come on, you're the one with the magic cock.

You must have shown it to her by now.

- She's training me to fight.
- Is she? Oh.

Every day.

Then how come an old cunt like me
can still sneak up and murder you?

Well, that's a different sort of fighting.

All right.

209
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:09,970
All right, let's start with your footwork.

210
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:12,514
Show me your stance.

211
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:15,433
Now listen to me, Pod.

212
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:17,561
See how your feet are about a yard apart?

213
00:16:18,854 --> 00:16:21,106
Lesson number one,
assume everyone wants to hit you.

214
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:24,234
'Cause they do, Pod.
Everyone wants to hit a fucking squire.

215
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:26,736
Do it again.

216
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:28,029
Come on, don't sulk.

217
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:29,656
JAIME: I never thought you'd find her.

218
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:31,158
I just assumed Sansa was dead.

219
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,410
Why would you assume that?

220
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:36,621
In my experience,
girls like her don't live very long.

221
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:40,083
I don't think you know many girls like her.

222
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,169
Well, I'm proud of you.

223
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:47,757
I am. You fulfilled your oath to Catelyn Stark
against all odds.

224
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:49,885
Of course, my sister wants Sansa dead.

225
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:53,555
The girl is still a suspect in Joffrey's murder,

226
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:57,184
so there is that complication.

227
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:00,353
What the hell are you doing here?

228

I've come for the Blackfish.

You're welcome to have him.

230
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:08,361
Lady Sansa desires to take her ancestral seat
back from the Boltons

231
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:11,364
and assume her rightful position
as Lady of Winterfell.

232
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:14,367
With what army
does she plan on taking Winterfell?

233
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:15,869
The Tully army.

234
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:17,746
They're a bit occupied at the moment.

235
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:21,208
I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun
currently defended by the Tully rebels,

236
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,168
so you can see the conundrum.

237
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:25,420
The Tullys are rebels
because they're fighting for their home?

238
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,631
Riverrun was granted to the Freys
by royal decree.

239
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:31,384
As a reward for betraying Robb Stark
and slaughtering his family.

240
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:32,886
Exactly.

241
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:38,600
We shouldn't argue about politics.

242
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:40,310
You're a knight, Ser Jaime.

243
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:43,313
I know there is honor in you.

244
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:46,399
- I've seen it myself.
- I'm a Lannister.

245
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:48,401
Don't ask me to betray my own house.

246
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:50,070
I do no such thing.

247
00:17:50,946 --> 00:17:53,573
Take Riverrun without bloodshed.

248
00:17:53,657 --> 00:17:57,202
Ride south again with your mission complete
and your army intact.

249
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:58,912
What do you propose?

250
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,331
Allow me to enter Riverrun
under a flag of truce.

251
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:05,043
Let me try to persuade the Blackfish
to give up the castle.

252
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:07,254
Why would he abandon his ancestral home?

253
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:10,674
Because you'll allow him
to lead the Tully forces safely north.

(SIGHS)

255
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:15,512
Have you ever met the Blackfish?

256
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:20,475
- No.
- He's even more stubborn than you are.

257
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,061
All right.

258
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:25,355
Try to talk some sense into the old goat.

259
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,816
He won't listen, but his men might.

260

Not everybody wants to die
for someone else's home.

261
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:32,654
I need your word.

262
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:36,658
If I persuade him to abandon the castle,
you'll grant us safe passage north.

263
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:39,869
You have my word.

264
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:42,706
You have until nightfall.

266
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,516
You gave it to me for a purpose.

267
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,020
I've achieved that purpose.

268
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:09,691
It's yours.

269
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:13,403
It will always be yours.

270
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:24,831
One last thing, Ser Jaime.

271
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:26,750
Yes, Lady Brienne?

272
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,628
Should I fail to persuade
the Blackfish to surrender

273
00:19:31,421 --> 00:19:33,256
and if you attack the castle,

274

Of course it does.

276
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:40,930
To fight you.

277
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:48,229
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.

278

BLACKFISH: I've said no three times already.

279
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:02,327
I have a signed letter
from your niece Sansa Stark...

280
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,245
I haven't seen her since she was a child.

281

I don't know her signature. I don't know you.

282
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:09,918
And I will not surrender.
Double the guards tonight.

283
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:13,588
The Kingslayer wants to try us.

284
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:15,215
I can feel it.

285
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:18,343
As I have said, my name is...

286
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:21,471
Yes, Brienne of Tarth. I know your father.
Good man.

287
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:22,931
He always spoke highly of you.

288
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:25,642
And if he were here now,
I'd tell him the same I'm telling you.

289
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:29,396
If you think I'm abandoning my family's seat
on the Kingslayer's word of honor,

290
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:30,730
you're a bloody fool.

291
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:33,483
Riverrun cannot stand against the Lannisters
and the Freys.

292
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:37,070
We can stand longer than
your one-handed friend thinks we can.

293
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:39,531
- He's not my friend.
- No?

294
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:44,369
Who gave you permission
to cross the siege line and enter the castle?

295
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:47,247
Who gave you that sword
with the gold lion on the pommel?

296
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:51,334
Ser Jaime kept his word
to your niece Catelyn Stark.

297
00:20:51,418 --> 00:20:54,421
He sent me to find Sansa,
to help her as Catelyn wanted.

298
00:20:54,504 --> 00:20:56,631
He gave me this sword to protect her.

299
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:58,133
That is what I have done

300
00:20:58,216 --> 00:21:01,511
and I will continue to do until the day I die.

I don't have enough men
to help her take Winterfell.

You have more than she does.

305
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:31,583
She wants her home back. I understand that.

306
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,418
But this is my home.

307
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:35,462
And if Jaime Lannister wants it,

308
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:38,423
he can bloody well take it
the way everyone else does.

Find the maester.

310
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:01,738
We need to get a raven north to Sansa.

311
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:05,074
What should I write?

312
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:09,913
Tell her I failed.

00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:40,253
Lords and ladies,

327
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:45,174
the Faith and the Crown
are the two pillars that hold up this world.

328
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:49,679
One collapses, so does the other.

329
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:54,100
The Father judges us all.

330
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:55,602
If you break his laws,

331
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,565
you will be punished.

332
00:24:02,984 --> 00:24:06,279
After conferring with
His Holiness the High Septon,

333
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:10,575
we have determined that Loras Tyrell
and Cersei Lannister's trial

334
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:14,912
will be held in the Great Sept of Baelor
on the first day of the Festival of the Mother.

335
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:16,331
(INDISTINCT MURMURS)

336
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:25,632
Furthermore, after much prayer
and reflection,

337
00:24:27,175 --> 00:24:30,094
the Crown has decided
that from this day forward,

338
00:24:30,178 --> 00:24:33,348
trial by combat will be forbidden
throughout the Seven Kingdoms.

339
00:24:36,184 --> 00:24:38,478
The tradition is a brutish one,

340
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:40,480
a scheme devised by corrupt rulers

341
00:24:40,563 --> 00:24:43,232
in order to avoid true judgment
from the gods.

342
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:47,820
Cersei Lannister and Loras Tyrell
will stand trial before seven septons

343
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:49,781
as it was in the earliest days of the Faith.

344
00:24:51,074 --> 00:24:52,992
Seven blessings to all.

345
00:24:53,076 --> 00:24:54,869
CROWD: Seven blessings.

346
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:04,420
(DOOR OPENING)

347
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:18,518
Your Grace.

348
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:22,980
That old rumor you told me about.

349
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:27,276
My little birds investigated.

350
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:30,613
And?

351
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:35,118
Was it just a rumor or something more?

352
00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:36,953
More.

353
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:40,707
Much more.

354
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:48,589
MISSANDEI: You seem happy.

355
00:25:49,257 --> 00:25:50,800
I am happy.

356
00:25:52,135 --> 00:25:54,095
You should both be happy as well.

357
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:57,932
Not so long ago,
this city was ready to devour itself.

358
00:25:58,683 --> 00:26:01,102
Now it's like a man reborn.

359
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:03,312
I will be happy when our queen returns.

360
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:06,899
Why don't you drink?
Why don't either of you ever drink?

361
00:26:06,983 --> 00:26:08,234
Unsullied never drink.

362
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:09,402
- Why not?
- Rules.

363
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,988
And who made these rules?

364
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,156
Your former masters?

365
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:17,326
Those miserable old shits
didn't want you to be human.

366
00:26:17,869 --> 00:26:19,996
Have a drink with me.

367
00:26:22,457 --> 00:26:25,668
And you? What's your excuse?

368
00:26:26,753 --> 00:26:30,173
I have tried wine before.
It made me feel funny.

369
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:31,799
That's how you know it's working.

370
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:36,012
Here's to our queen.

371
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,891
Anyone not drinking
is disrespecting our queen.

372
00:26:43,853 --> 00:26:47,315
To Daenerys Stormborn, Mother of Dragons,
Breaker of Chains,

373
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:48,941
long may she reign.

374
00:26:49,025 --> 00:26:51,110
- Long may she reign.
- Long may she reign.

375
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:58,451
TYRION: Do you like it?

376
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:00,578
GREY WORM: Tastes like it has turned.

377
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:03,873
Yes, yes. Fermentation.

378
00:27:07,585 --> 00:27:11,756
One day, after our queen has taken
the Seven Kingdoms,

379
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,635
I'd like to have my own vineyard.

380
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:19,222
Make my own wine.

381
00:27:20,223 --> 00:27:21,933
The Imp's Delight.

382
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:25,144
Only my close friends could drink it.

383
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:30,233
Tell me a joke, Missandei of Naath.

384
00:27:31,943 --> 00:27:33,236
I do not know any jokes.

385
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,071
Grey Worm?

386
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:38,908
Right.

387
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:44,413
Three lords walk into a tavern.

388
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:46,457
A Stark, a Martell and a Lannister.

389
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:48,626
They order ale,

390
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:51,337
but when the barkeep brings them over,

391
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,923
each of them finds a fly in his cup.

392
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:58,386
The Lannister, outraged,
shoves the cup aside and demands another.

393
00:27:58,469 --> 00:28:02,348
The Martell plucks the fly out
and swallows it whole.

394
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:06,435
The Stark reaches into his cup,

395
00:28:07,687 --> 00:28:09,772
pulls out the fly and shouts,

396
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:14,110
"Spit it out, you wee shit. Spit it out."

397
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:22,535
It's funnier in Westeros.

398
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:25,580
The Starks and the Lannisters,
I thought these were enemies.

399
00:28:25,663 --> 00:28:26,831
Yes.

400
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:29,667
A joke is like a story, Torgo Nudho.

401
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:32,670
Not a true story, necessarily.

402
00:28:32,753 --> 00:28:35,298
A story that's supposed
to make you laugh ideally.

403
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:37,925
Not at the moment, perhaps.

404
00:28:38,009 --> 00:28:40,219
Missandei, do you like the wine?

405
00:28:40,803 --> 00:28:41,762
I do.

406
00:28:41,846 --> 00:28:43,139
Tell a joke.

407
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,064
Two translators are on a sinking ship.

408
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:55,818
The first says,

409
00:28:55,902 --> 00:28:57,653
"Do you know how to swim?"

410
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:02,658
The second says, "No, but I can
shout for help in 19 languages."

411
00:29:05,703 --> 00:29:07,663
Ah! (LAUGHS)

412
00:29:12,001 --> 00:29:14,086
That is the worst joke I ever heard.

413
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:15,588
MISSANDEI:
You don't even know what a joke is.

414
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,799
I am soldier all my life.
You think I never hear joke?

415
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:21,177
You lied to us.

416
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:24,180
I make joke.

417
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:26,515

420

I once walked into a brothel
with a honeycomb and a jackass.

I apologize for the way the Freys treated you.

born of a wife that I haven't seen
since our first night together.

You should be with them both.

I can arrange that, you realize?

447

Comfortable rooms for you at Casterly Rock.

A tutor for your boy,
knights to train him to fight and to ride.

449
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:20,963
And when he comes of age,
he'll have a keep of his own.

Kept me in a cell for years.

454
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:35,061
Stolen our lands.

455

I'll remind you that our houses are at war.

I'm sorry if this conflict
has inconvenienced you,

It's not.

You understand. On some level
you understand that you're an evil man.

Tell me, I want to know. I truly do.

469
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:22,316
How do you live with yourself?

470
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:30,825
All of us have to believe
that we're decent, don't we?

471
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:33,661
You have to sleep at night.

472
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:37,915
How do you tell yourself that you're decent

473
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:42,378
after everything that you've done?

474
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:50,553
I was your sister's prisoner once.

475
00:32:54,056 --> 00:32:57,309
She hit me on the head with a rock
if I remember correctly.

476
00:32:58,352 --> 00:32:59,353
(LAUGHS)

477
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:01,647
Yeah.

478
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:04,942
She should have killed you.

479
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:06,861
Perhaps, but she didn't.

480
00:33:08,404 --> 00:33:11,907
Catelyn Stark hated me just like you hate me.

481
00:33:12,408 --> 00:33:14,368
But I didn't hate her.

482
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:15,744
I admired her.

483
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:18,205
Far more than her husband or her son.

484
00:33:18,289 --> 00:33:20,541
Do you think I care whom you admire
and whom you don't?

485
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:22,918
No, I don't, but I'm telling you anyway
because you're my prisoner.

486
00:33:23,002 --> 00:33:24,670
You don't have a choice.

487

The love she had for her children,
I was a little awed by it.

She loved her children.

I suppose all mothers do,

497
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:56,118
but Catelyn and Cersei,

498
00:33:56,202 --> 00:33:58,704

She needs me.

508
00:34:30,861 --> 00:34:33,906
And to get back to her,
I have to take Riverrun.

509

He's the Lord of Riverrun.
I have to obey his commands.

He's been their captive

at the Red Wedding.

Why do you think the people who murdered
his king at the Red Wedding

529
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:04,121
would decide to let him come home?

00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:11,264
But the Lord of Light
gave you the power to defeat me.

649
00:48:11,347 --> 00:48:12,348
Why?

650
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:13,808
(LAUGHS)

651
00:48:14,142 --> 00:48:17,395
I beat you because I'm better than you, Beric.

652
00:48:17,479 --> 00:48:21,566
I was better than you before you started
yammering on about the Lord,

653
00:48:21,649 --> 00:48:24,402
and I'm better than you now.

654
00:48:24,486 --> 00:48:26,279
Aye, you're probably right.

655
00:48:27,238 --> 00:48:29,115
You're a fighter.

656
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:31,743
You were born a fighter.

657
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:34,412
You walked away from the fight.

658
00:48:34,496 --> 00:48:35,705
How did that go?

659
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:42,253
Good and bad, young and old,

660
00:48:42,337 --> 00:48:44,631
the things we're fighting
will destroy them all alike.

661
00:48:46,549 --> 00:48:49,803
You can still help
a lot more than you've harmed, Clegane.

662
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:52,347
It's not too late for you.

Lady Crane?

If you'd have done your job,
she would have died painlessly.

Instead...

670
00:50:24,147 --> 00:50:26,357
The Many-Faced God was promised a name.

671
00:50:27,817 --> 00:50:29,944
He must always receive what is his.

672

You can't change that.

I can't change that.

No one can.

675
00:50:40,288 --> 00:50:42,624
And now he's been promised another name.
