1
00:00:00,318 --> 00:00:01,726
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:01,729 --> 00:00:03,960
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:03,963 --> 00:00:05,130
To the outside world,

4
00:00:05,133 --> 00:00:07,109
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist.

5
00:00:07,112 --> 00:00:08,550
But secretly, with the help

6
00:00:08,553 --> 00:00:09,986
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

7
00:00:09,989 --> 00:00:11,250
I fight crime and find

8
00:00:11,253 --> 00:00:12,867
other meta-humans like me.

9
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,164
But when my daughter came
back from the future to help,

10
00:00:15,167 --> 00:00:17,629
she changed the present...

11
00:00:17,632 --> 00:00:20,299
and now our world is
more dangerous than ever.

12
00:00:20,301 --> 00:00:22,735
And I'm the only one
fast enough to save it.

13
00:00:22,737 --> 00:00:25,039
I am the Flash.

14
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,442
Previously on "The Flash"...

15
00:00:27,445 --> 00:00:28,445
You threw yourself

16
00:00:28,448 --> 00:00:30,984
- off a building to save Dad?
- Yeah.

17
00:00:30,987 --> 00:00:33,044
We all know the sound
of Cicada's breathing.

18
00:00:33,047 --> 00:00:34,359
His lungs are injured.

19
00:00:34,362 --> 00:00:36,296
We can't keep doing
this. It's not healing.

20
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:37,896
Killer Frost has been
gone since the night

21
00:00:37,898 --> 00:00:39,118
the DeVoe took over your body.

22
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:39,916
Is she gone for good?

23
00:00:39,918 --> 00:00:41,165
I've tried everything I can think of

24
00:00:41,167 --> 00:00:42,109
to get her to reappear.

25
00:00:42,112 --> 00:00:43,960
My father told me to come find him.

26
00:00:43,963 --> 00:00:45,257
My dad's been dead for years.

27
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,742
He knew that there were two of you.

28
00:00:46,745 --> 00:00:48,601
He knew the truth about Killer Frost.

29
00:00:49,743 --> 00:00:52,497
- We've got eyes and ears!
- I knew you could do it.

30
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,500
There's only one sure
place somebody could hide.

31
00:00:54,502 --> 00:00:56,202
A Tannhauser black ops site.

32
00:01:00,141 --> 00:01:03,776
Vanilla latte and a
Medium Zoom for Raelene.

33
00:01:03,778 --> 00:01:05,744
Thank you.

34
00:01:59,734 --> 00:02:01,066
Should've left me alone.

35
00:02:10,544 --> 00:02:15,947
And you never should have existed.

36
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:26,158

37
00:02:27,428 --> 00:02:29,695
We are back in business.

38
00:02:29,697 --> 00:02:30,969
And by business, he means

39
00:02:30,972 --> 00:02:32,891
the better-than-Sally
the satellite business.

40
00:02:32,894 --> 00:02:34,337
And what does that mean?

41
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,401
That means we're getting
closer to identifying

42
00:02:36,404 --> 00:02:38,304
the ever-elusive Cicada.

43
00:02:38,306 --> 00:02:40,326
It's Cicada, Sherloque.

44
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:42,808
Once I hacked DeVoe's satellites,

45
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,645
all I had to do was just use an
impact extrapolation algorithm

46
00:02:46,647 --> 00:02:48,948
to predict where the
shrapnel would've fallen

47
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,283
after Barry and Nora
pulled a Johnny Cage

48
00:02:51,285 --> 00:02:52,284
on Sally the satellite.

49
00:02:52,286 --> 00:02:53,519
May God rest her soul.

50
00:02:53,521 --> 00:02:55,688
So now we got 46 locations

51
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,723
where 46 pieces of shrapnel landed.

52
00:02:57,725 --> 00:03:00,192
And once of these
locations is where Cicada

53
00:03:00,194 --> 00:03:01,527
will have been injured.

54
00:03:01,529 --> 00:03:03,128
Except we don't know which one.

55
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,226
Or maybe we do.

56
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:07,265
You see, after my hands got
sliced by Cicada's dagger,

57
00:03:07,268 --> 00:03:09,034
Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman, here

58
00:03:09,036 --> 00:03:11,003
measured the dark matter in my system.

59
00:03:11,005 --> 00:03:13,205
And its levels of
concentration were higher

60
00:03:13,207 --> 00:03:14,611
than any I'd ever seen before.

61
00:03:14,614 --> 00:03:17,177
Insanely high, and the
only part of the satellite

62
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,678
that would have dark
matter levels that high...

63
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,148
Is the core, which is where
Cicada's dagger came from.

64
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,984
So we find the location of the core

65
00:03:24,986 --> 00:03:26,483
and we'll know where
Cicada was that night.

66
00:03:26,485 --> 00:03:27,641
You know, FEMA set up sites

67
00:03:27,644 --> 00:03:29,054
to help people after the Enlightenment.

68
00:03:29,056 --> 00:03:30,210
If Cicada was injured,

69
00:03:30,213 --> 00:03:31,991
maybe he received medical
treatment at one of them.

70
00:03:31,993 --> 00:03:32,921
That's a great idea.

71
00:03:32,924 --> 00:03:35,793
I mean, we could check with
FEMA to see if any fathers

72
00:03:35,796 --> 00:03:38,564
matching Cicada's description
reported any injuries

73
00:03:38,566 --> 00:03:40,679
- near the crash site.
- So, we split up.

74
00:03:40,682 --> 00:03:42,308
Okay, great. I'm good
at tracking things down.

75
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,168
So I will try and find
the satellite core.

76
00:03:44,171 --> 00:03:45,601
I will come with you
and everybody else look

77
00:03:45,603 --> 00:03:46,309
for the names.

78
00:03:46,312 --> 00:03:48,555
Um, do you mind if I
actually come with you too?

79
00:03:48,558 --> 00:03:51,075
It's just that I saw you
jump off a building last week

80
00:03:51,078 --> 00:03:52,378
and that was awesome.

81
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,013
So I thought maybe I'd come with you

82
00:03:54,015 --> 00:03:55,106
while you did some detective work.

83
00:03:55,108 --> 00:03:57,292
Oh, I think that two people
is going to be more than enough

84
00:03:57,294 --> 00:03:59,118
- for what we need...
- What he's trying to say

85
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,430
is that we would love
to have you come with us.

86
00:04:01,433 --> 00:04:03,188
Okay.

87
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,156
All right, well, why
don't I talk to FEMA

88
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:08,441
and see if I can get some names.

89
00:04:08,444 --> 00:04:09,810
Hey, I know Joe's been itching

90
00:04:09,813 --> 00:04:11,264
to get out of the
house, and it might help

91
00:04:11,266 --> 00:04:13,031
to have an actual badge.

92
00:04:13,034 --> 00:04:14,900
Nobody does case snacks like Joe West.

93
00:04:14,902 --> 00:04:16,769
- I'll swing by on the way.
- All right, cool.

94
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:23,942
So, Snow Patrol, what's going on?

95
00:04:23,944 --> 00:04:25,577
You tell me.

96
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:27,913
I'm guessing it's not a coincidence

97
00:04:27,915 --> 00:04:29,915
that we're left here with nothing to do

98
00:04:29,917 --> 00:04:31,347
for the next few hours.

99
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,551
I know we were supposed to
wait until you were ready

100
00:04:33,554 --> 00:04:34,909
to locate your dad.

101
00:04:34,912 --> 00:04:37,622
But I had the satellites track down

102
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:40,125
all the decommissioned
Tannhauser black ops sites

103
00:04:40,127 --> 00:04:41,816
that your dad could possibly be in.

104
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:43,206
Okay.

105
00:04:43,209 --> 00:04:46,844
And... and then I hacked
into their security systems.

106
00:04:46,847 --> 00:04:49,467
He was the last person
to enter one of them.

107
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:50,969
A week after he died.

108
00:04:50,971 --> 00:04:53,672
And he never left.

109
00:04:56,677 --> 00:04:58,343
Where is he?

110
00:05:00,681 --> 00:05:03,816
It's open. Come in.

111
00:05:05,686 --> 00:05:08,787
Hey! Cecile.

112
00:05:08,789 --> 00:05:10,622
- Hey.
- Is... is Joe here?

113
00:05:10,624 --> 00:05:12,511
Uh, no. He's out with Jenna.

114
00:05:12,514 --> 00:05:14,120
Oh, dang. Okay. Bummer.

115
00:05:14,123 --> 00:05:16,722
All right, I'll go get some
falafel and come back in a bit.

116
00:05:16,725 --> 00:05:18,091
Wait, no. Please don't...

117
00:05:18,094 --> 00:05:21,222
Leave me here. Um, what did you need?

118
00:05:21,225 --> 00:05:23,058
Maybe I can help you.

119
00:05:23,061 --> 00:05:26,062
Oh, I need somebody to flash a badge

120
00:05:26,065 --> 00:05:28,261
and generally look intimidating, so.

121
00:05:28,264 --> 00:05:31,966
You don't think that I can be intimidating.

122
00:05:31,969 --> 00:05:33,978
Oh, my God, you don't, do you?

123
00:05:35,983 --> 00:05:37,456
Ralph, I am the district attorney.

124
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:39,093
You know I psychically
teleported the Flash

125
00:05:39,095 --> 00:05:40,895
inside the Thinker's mind

126
00:05:40,898 --> 00:05:43,198
whilst giving birth to my daughter,

127
00:05:43,201 --> 00:05:44,901
sans epidural... it hurt!

128
00:05:44,904 --> 00:05:49,206
I literally saved the
world between contractions,

129
00:05:49,209 --> 00:05:51,743
and you don't think
that I am intimidating?

130
00:05:51,746 --> 00:05:53,679
I'm really intimidated
right now, actually.

131
00:05:53,682 --> 00:05:55,282
You are very intimidating.

132
00:05:55,285 --> 00:05:57,253
Okay, what are we doing?

133
00:05:57,256 --> 00:06:01,091
Uh, we are getting a list
of FEMA recipients treated

134
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:03,361
after the Enlightenment
to hopefully find

135
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:04,472
Cicada's real name.

136
00:06:04,475 --> 00:06:06,691
FEMA, come on. I worked with them a ton.

137
00:06:06,694 --> 00:06:08,427
I know that org inside and out.

138
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,643
Just, uh... oh, give me
five. I gotta go pump first.

139
00:06:10,646 --> 00:06:12,312
What are we pumping?

140
00:06:12,315 --> 00:06:13,623
Oh.

141
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,889
Coordinates are set for the North Pole.

142
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,135
Thank you guys for coming with me.

143
00:06:23,138 --> 00:06:24,604
Ready when you are.

144
00:06:24,607 --> 00:06:26,273
Okay.

145
00:06:27,946 --> 00:06:30,792
Oh! Here we go.

146
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,995
Can't see anything!

147
00:06:35,998 --> 00:06:38,432
My face just went full Weeknd!

148
00:06:38,435 --> 00:06:39,966
Wait, I think I see something.

149
00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:41,335
Over here!

150
00:06:41,338 --> 00:06:43,138
What?

151
00:06:44,644 --> 00:06:46,118
I think it's a building.

152
00:06:48,189 --> 00:06:50,522
Is there a door?

153
00:06:50,524 --> 00:06:52,992
We don't need one.

154
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:01,700
Hello? Anybody here?

155
00:07:01,702 --> 00:07:03,736
There.

156
00:07:18,352 --> 00:07:20,719
Hey.

157
00:07:20,721 --> 00:07:22,821
You okay?

158
00:07:22,823 --> 00:07:24,390
When my father entered this facility

159
00:07:24,392 --> 00:07:25,991
nearly 20 years ago,

160
00:07:25,993 --> 00:07:28,694
he had severe ALS.

161
00:07:28,696 --> 00:07:33,198
Maybe the reason he never
left is 'cause he couldn't.

162
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,467
Look, whatever we find in here,

163
00:07:35,469 --> 00:07:36,969
we'll be right here with you.

164
00:07:47,515 --> 00:07:49,181
Ugh.

165
00:07:49,183 --> 00:07:52,618
It smells like science in here.

166
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,721
What kind of research does
your mom's lab do, exactly?

167
00:07:55,723 --> 00:07:59,224
I honestly don't even know anymore.

168
00:07:59,226 --> 00:08:00,325
Caity?

169
00:08:04,398 --> 00:08:07,666
Dad? Is that you?

170
00:08:07,668 --> 00:08:10,269
Is this really happening?

171
00:08:10,271 --> 00:08:12,271
You're alive.

172
00:08:12,273 --> 00:08:13,639
Are you... you're real?

173
00:08:13,641 --> 00:08:16,408
Yeah, Dad, it's me. I'm real. I'm real.

174
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,946
You found me.

175
00:08:30,035 --> 00:08:31,935
You got my message.

176
00:08:31,937 --> 00:08:34,971
I did in the periodic
table we made together.

177
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:38,942
It took me 20 years to find
it, but it led me to you.

178
00:08:38,944 --> 00:08:40,910
I knew you would come.

179
00:08:40,912 --> 00:08:42,412
Thank you.

180
00:08:42,414 --> 00:08:44,380
I thank all of you.

181
00:08:44,382 --> 00:08:46,488
Dad, these are my friends. This is...

182
00:08:46,491 --> 00:08:50,286
Uh, Barry Allen and Cisco Ramon. I know.

183
00:08:50,288 --> 00:08:52,622
Um, sorry. How do you know us?

184
00:08:52,624 --> 00:08:54,224
Well, when I first came here,

185
00:08:54,226 --> 00:08:55,992
I stayed in contact with scientists.

186
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:59,963
Louise Lincoln, Victor
Fries, and Harrison Wells.

187
00:08:59,965 --> 00:09:03,633
Dr. Wells was able to
give me full access to, uh,

188
00:09:03,635 --> 00:09:06,135
S.T.A.R. Labs video uplink.

189
00:09:06,137 --> 00:09:09,239
Wait a minute. You've... you've
had video lin to S.T.A.R. Labs

190
00:09:09,241 --> 00:09:10,175
this entire time?

191
00:09:10,178 --> 00:09:12,908
Oh, no. God no. I mean, it
hasn't worked until recently.

192
00:09:12,911 --> 00:09:14,744
And unfortunately, since it rebooted,

193
00:09:14,746 --> 00:09:17,780
its capabilities is
only as a one-way video,

194
00:09:17,782 --> 00:09:21,117
so I could see you but
I couldn't reach you.

195
00:09:21,119 --> 00:09:24,120
Well, it looks like you had
plenty of toys around here

196
00:09:24,122 --> 00:09:25,288
to keep you company.

197
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:27,223
This neat little incubator.

198
00:09:27,225 --> 00:09:28,591
What's it for?

199
00:09:28,593 --> 00:09:31,661
Well, that was here when I got here.

200
00:09:31,663 --> 00:09:34,163
Never had any use for that thing.

201
00:09:34,165 --> 00:09:36,532
I don't understand. Why are you here?

202
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,701
I mean, how are you still even alive?

203
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:42,705
ALS is a horrible disease,
and I grew desperate,

204
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:47,176
and I began experimenting with
therapies using cryogenics.

205
00:09:47,178 --> 00:09:49,445
Something went wrong?

206
00:09:49,447 --> 00:09:51,114
Yes.

207
00:09:51,116 --> 00:09:53,616
The, uh, experiments became
more and more dangerous.

208
00:09:53,618 --> 00:09:55,318
And I quarantined myself

209
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,613
for the sake of everyone's safety.

210
00:09:58,616 --> 00:10:03,960
I did manage to freeze the
progression of that disease.

211
00:10:03,962 --> 00:10:07,363
Not before the site
was entirely closed out,

212
00:10:07,365 --> 00:10:09,432
and I have been here ever since.

213
00:10:09,434 --> 00:10:11,532
They shut down this site
while you were still in it

214
00:10:11,535 --> 00:10:13,202
and locked you in.

215
00:10:13,204 --> 00:10:15,605
It was my mother, wasn't it?

216
00:10:15,607 --> 00:10:18,174
She's the only one with
an authority to shut down

217
00:10:18,176 --> 00:10:19,285
a Tannhauser site.

218
00:10:19,288 --> 00:10:20,859
Listen, your mother
thought it would be easier

219
00:10:20,861 --> 00:10:22,386
for you not to see me.

220
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:25,547
But I always had the faith
that I could cure this thing.

221
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:28,484
That's why I sent you the note.

222
00:10:28,486 --> 00:10:31,220
So how... how did you
survive here this whole time?

223
00:10:31,222 --> 00:10:34,424
Water. Rations.

224
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:37,760
Spending months at a time
in that cryogenic chamber.

225
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:40,530
Well, you don't ever
have to do that again,

226
00:10:40,532 --> 00:10:43,399
because we can get you out of here.

227
00:10:43,401 --> 00:10:45,335
We're gonna give you your life back.

228
00:10:50,855 --> 00:10:54,410
Shouldn't this place be
packed to the rafters?

229
00:10:54,412 --> 00:10:58,081
I mean, we had a citywide
disaster not long ago.

230
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,116
Don't worry. I got this.

231
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:02,269
It's time to put the war face on.

232
00:11:04,255 --> 00:11:06,789
Hey, buddy, pull them out.

233
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,659
Lose the music. Hi,
I'm DA Cecile Horton.

234
00:11:09,661 --> 00:11:12,095
This is my associate, Ralph Dibny.

235
00:11:12,097 --> 00:11:13,763
- DA?
- Mm.

236
00:11:13,765 --> 00:11:15,231
How can I help you?

237
00:11:15,233 --> 00:11:16,816
You the field director here?

238
00:11:16,819 --> 00:11:19,601
Assistant. You got a claim or
something I can help you with?

239
00:11:19,604 --> 00:11:22,505
We're trying to ID a suspect
in a criminal investigation

240
00:11:22,507 --> 00:11:23,892
and we're going to need to
take a look at the names of

241
00:11:23,894 --> 00:11:26,608
all the people you've assisted
in the last six months.

242
00:11:26,611 --> 00:11:29,412
I can't give you anyone's names.

243
00:11:29,414 --> 00:11:31,222
You'll need to get a warrant for that.

244
00:11:31,225 --> 00:11:33,358
Listen up, mister!

245
00:11:33,361 --> 00:11:35,218
Bagger Vance!

246
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,486
It's Vance Brandon.

247
00:11:37,922 --> 00:11:40,490
You listen to me when I tell you

248
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:43,126
that this is my town, baby.

249
00:11:43,128 --> 00:11:45,762
Oh, yeah, and I can make some real

250
00:11:45,764 --> 00:11:47,597
bad stuff happen for you.

251
00:11:47,599 --> 00:11:49,332
Like, really, really no bueno.

252
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:52,301
Yeah, well, this is my country,

253
00:11:52,303 --> 00:11:54,404
which is a lot bigger than your town.

254
00:11:54,406 --> 00:11:57,273
- That's true.
- So, until you get a warrant,

255
00:11:57,275 --> 00:11:59,075
you're not getting anything.

256
00:11:59,077 --> 00:12:01,715
But wait, did you... Bagger?
Bagger Va... did you...

257
00:12:01,718 --> 00:12:03,446
But this my war face.

258
00:12:03,448 --> 00:12:05,648
I put my war face on.

259
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,316
That was my war face, Ralph.

260
00:12:07,318 --> 00:12:09,152
It's okay, I... I think you're just...

261
00:12:09,154 --> 00:12:11,020
You're... you're a
little rusty, that's all.

262
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:12,789
Oh, no. That was way more

263
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:15,725
than a little rust, Ralph.

264
00:12:15,727 --> 00:12:17,927
I've lost my mojo.

265
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,501
Oh, that was a... new mode of travel.

266
00:12:25,503 --> 00:12:27,737
That is what we call an interdimensional

267
00:12:27,739 --> 00:12:28,996
space-time breach.

268
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:30,603
It takes a little
while to get used to it.

269
00:12:30,605 --> 00:12:35,445
So, this is S.T.A.R. Labs, IRL.

270
00:12:35,447 --> 00:12:38,019
Look at that view.

271
00:12:38,022 --> 00:12:39,480
I want to run some tests.

272
00:12:39,483 --> 00:12:42,484
Make sure everything
is all right with you.

273
00:12:42,487 --> 00:12:45,988
This city is so beautiful.

274
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:50,393
The sunsets here.

275
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,332
I used to think about them all the time.

276
00:12:52,335 --> 00:12:54,397
Hey, maybe you guys should just

277
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,731
go for a walk or something.

278
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:58,301
Try and reconnect first.

279
00:12:58,303 --> 00:13:00,002
Yeah.

280
00:13:00,004 --> 00:13:02,705
Um, why don't we go for a walk?

281
00:13:02,707 --> 00:13:04,340
Get some fresh air.

282
00:13:04,342 --> 00:13:05,975
I can run my tests later.

283
00:13:05,977 --> 00:13:07,577
I love that plan.

284
00:13:14,686 --> 00:13:15,863
What's up with you?

285
00:13:15,866 --> 00:13:18,153
Dude, this story is full of holes.

286
00:13:18,156 --> 00:13:19,355
I'm just trying to fill them.

287
00:13:19,357 --> 00:13:21,190
Nora's story had holes in them,

288
00:13:21,192 --> 00:13:23,726
and she was only lying to me
'cause she wanted to meet me.

289
00:13:23,728 --> 00:13:26,395
I've appreciated every second
that we've had together so far.

290
00:13:26,397 --> 00:13:29,632
Caitlin just got her dad back.

291
00:13:29,634 --> 00:13:30,733
Let's be happy for her.

292
00:13:30,735 --> 00:13:33,469
Hey, I'm happy.

293
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,947
So what are we doing first?

294
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:48,050
Uh, well, you're a speedster.

295
00:13:48,052 --> 00:13:51,787
So I was thinking you
could run around the site.

296
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,472
See if you can find the core.

297
00:13:53,475 --> 00:13:55,557
I thought, since it's
our first time teaming up,

298
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,528
maybe I could go with you and
we can interview the people

299
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:00,556
who were here the night of
the Enlightenment together.

300
00:14:00,558 --> 00:14:03,366
Oh, um, uh...

301
00:14:03,368 --> 00:14:04,600
- Or no.
- No, no, no.

302
00:14:04,602 --> 00:14:06,302
Yeah, it's just...

303
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:09,405
Normally, I interview people by myself.

304
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:12,082
Oh, oh, my God. No, no. It's fine.

305
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:14,451
It's... I wouldn't ask you
to come speed around the city

306
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:15,920
with me or anything like that.

307
00:14:15,923 --> 00:14:17,398
- It's fine.
- Okay, well, I'll...

308
00:14:17,401 --> 00:14:19,702
- No, no, no. You come with me...
- I'll come with you, okay.

309
00:14:19,704 --> 00:14:21,113
And we'll interview the foreman.

310
00:14:21,116 --> 00:14:22,699
All right, let's not. How about that?

311
00:14:22,702 --> 00:14:25,120
Look, we have 45 more sites to search.

312
00:14:25,123 --> 00:14:27,700
Clearly we don't have the time
and clearly we must split up.

313
00:14:27,703 --> 00:14:30,792
So you go search for the core
and you go talk to the foreman.

314
00:14:30,795 --> 00:14:32,395
I will look for clues.

315
00:14:35,995 --> 00:14:38,196
And this is how investigations collapse.

316
00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:39,855
Hey, babe.

317
00:14:39,858 --> 00:14:42,933
No, the mother-daughter team-up
is kinda off to a rocky start.

318
00:14:42,936 --> 00:14:44,431
But I don't know, I
think we'll get there.

319
00:14:44,433 --> 00:14:45,608
So?

320
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:47,410
- The core's not here.
- Well...

321
00:14:47,412 --> 00:14:48,911
why don't you go search the other sites?

322
00:14:48,913 --> 00:14:50,479
We'll finish up here.

323
00:14:52,317 --> 00:14:54,617
Well, no, you don't want
to do that, do you, no?

324
00:14:54,619 --> 00:14:58,355
Because, um, you're not
here to investigate, are you?

325
00:14:58,358 --> 00:15:00,456
No, you're here to spend
time with your mother, right?

326
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:02,325
Well, I just thought maybe
we would find something

327
00:15:02,327 --> 00:15:04,571
in common if we worked
on a case together.

328
00:15:04,574 --> 00:15:07,830
But she's really good at prying
information out of people.

329
00:15:07,832 --> 00:15:09,966
Believe me, and...

330
00:15:09,968 --> 00:15:13,269
I'm fast on my feet.

331
00:15:13,271 --> 00:15:14,804
I'm gonna go back to S.T.A.R. labs.

332
00:15:14,806 --> 00:15:16,572
Hold on, wait.

333
00:15:16,574 --> 00:15:19,609
I have another plan to
try and find this core.

334
00:15:19,611 --> 00:15:21,944
It involves you and your mother.

335
00:15:26,944 --> 00:15:29,951
So, uh, cherry soda. Popcorn.

336
00:15:29,954 --> 00:15:33,456
I haven't had a cup of Jitters
coffee in quite a while.

337
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:36,959
But the thing that
I miss the most was...

338
00:15:36,961 --> 00:15:39,195
Peanut butter and jelly waffles.

339
00:15:39,197 --> 00:15:41,964
Yeah, Mom used to hate
it when you made those.

340
00:15:41,966 --> 00:15:44,160
Yeah, well, your mom always wanted

341
00:15:44,163 --> 00:15:47,402
the nicer things in life, I guess,

342
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:50,006
and I was happy with simple.

343
00:15:50,008 --> 00:15:53,409
It's a wonder you two ever got together.

344
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:55,402
- How is she?
- The same.

345
00:15:55,405 --> 00:15:56,808
I don't really see her that often,

346
00:15:56,811 --> 00:15:59,214
and when I do, she's cold as ice.

347
00:15:59,217 --> 00:16:01,368
And now, after what she did to you...

348
00:16:01,371 --> 00:16:03,019
Oh, well, look,

349
00:16:03,021 --> 00:16:06,363
she may be a little bit chilly,
but she does love you, Caity.

350
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:08,057
It's been really hard without you.

351
00:16:08,059 --> 00:16:11,027
I mean, just me and her.

352
00:16:11,029 --> 00:16:12,595
It was tough.

353
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:15,031
- Yeah.
- I've been through a lot.

354
00:16:15,033 --> 00:16:17,652
A lot of that has to do with me.

355
00:16:17,655 --> 00:16:19,200
- No.
- No, no, listen,

356
00:16:19,203 --> 00:16:21,203
and... and I wasn't there for you.

357
00:16:21,205 --> 00:16:23,339
All these years... They went by and I...

358
00:16:23,341 --> 00:16:25,074
I want to make it up to you, Caity.

359
00:16:25,076 --> 00:16:27,677
I mean, I really should've
been there for you, right?

360
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:29,774
I mean... and I wish
that I could just...

361
00:16:29,777 --> 00:16:31,681
Dad? Oh, my God.

362
00:16:31,683 --> 00:16:34,016
Dad. Here, sit.

363
00:16:34,018 --> 00:16:35,584
Oh, my God. Dad?

364
00:16:35,586 --> 00:16:38,287
Dad, Dad.

365
00:16:50,084 --> 00:16:51,283
Caity?

366
00:16:51,286 --> 00:16:53,591
Dad? I'm right here.

367
00:16:56,362 --> 00:16:59,764
You saw my disease?

368
00:16:59,766 --> 00:17:04,869
Yeah, uh... the dermis is crystallizing.

369
00:17:04,871 --> 00:17:06,470
And it's spreading.

370
00:17:06,472 --> 00:17:09,106
I ran some tests while
you were unconscious.

371
00:17:09,108 --> 00:17:11,509
You have a cryogenic malignancy

372
00:17:11,511 --> 00:17:13,544
and a somatic mutation.

373
00:17:13,546 --> 00:17:15,219
It's not contagious but...

374
00:17:15,222 --> 00:17:17,014
It's rewriting my genetic code.

375
00:17:17,016 --> 00:17:19,583
And if it continues, you could...

376
00:17:19,585 --> 00:17:20,785
Die.

377
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:25,923
Well, I cured my ALS,

378
00:17:25,925 --> 00:17:29,203
but I created something
even more deadly.

379
00:17:29,206 --> 00:17:32,862
Every time my emotions
spike, my malignancy spreads.

380
00:17:32,865 --> 00:17:35,499
Like when you're angry or scared?

381
00:17:35,501 --> 00:17:37,635
I wish I had just
left well enough alone.

382
00:17:37,637 --> 00:17:39,937
For both of us.

383
00:17:39,939 --> 00:17:44,775
Wait, did I have the
genetic marker for ALS too

384
00:17:44,777 --> 00:17:46,539
and you tried to cure me?

385
00:17:46,542 --> 00:17:50,013
So my powers came from you?

386
00:17:50,016 --> 00:17:51,882
Killer Frost is my cure?

387
00:17:51,884 --> 00:17:53,078
Killer Frost?

388
00:17:53,081 --> 00:17:54,859
You may know her by a different name.

389
00:17:54,862 --> 00:17:56,125
Khione.

390
00:17:56,128 --> 00:17:57,664
Dad, what did you do to me?

391
00:17:57,667 --> 00:18:00,527
I wasn't gonna let
the ALS manifest in you

392
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:01,867
like it did in me.

393
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:05,829
So you used experiments
with cryogenic gene therapy

394
00:18:05,832 --> 00:18:07,098
on your own daughter?

395
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,400
I had already done it on myself.

396
00:18:09,402 --> 00:18:13,371
Caity, I made alterations
to the treatment.

397
00:18:13,373 --> 00:18:15,239
I tried to make it safer, Caity,

398
00:18:15,241 --> 00:18:17,942
and you started to
exhibit dual personality

399
00:18:17,944 --> 00:18:20,586
soon after I treated you.

400
00:18:20,589 --> 00:18:25,849
So is, um, Khione or Killer Frost...

401
00:18:25,852 --> 00:18:27,318
Is she still around?

402
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,254
No, she... she's been
gone for a little while,

403
00:18:30,256 --> 00:18:31,889
but she's still a part of me.

404
00:18:33,493 --> 00:18:36,293
So where's your dual personality?

405
00:18:36,295 --> 00:18:38,496
You and Caitlin carry the same markers,

406
00:18:38,498 --> 00:18:40,698
you took the same cure.

407
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,733
Where your Khione?

408
00:18:42,735 --> 00:18:46,003
I never had one.

409
00:18:46,005 --> 00:18:49,774
That's probably why...

410
00:18:49,776 --> 00:18:51,942
I'm dying and you're not.

411
00:18:51,944 --> 00:18:55,780
Okay, what if we use my
cells to create a serum

412
00:18:55,782 --> 00:18:57,261
to stabilize your body?

413
00:18:57,264 --> 00:18:59,616
Um, we have to stop your
atoms from oscillating.

414
00:18:59,619 --> 00:19:02,453
So get your body to a
temperature of absolute zero.

415
00:19:02,455 --> 00:19:03,888
Caitlin, that could kill him.

416
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,823
My cells can theoretically

417
00:19:05,825 --> 00:19:08,092
withstand subzero temperatures

418
00:19:08,094 --> 00:19:10,327
because of my cryogenic gene therapy.

419
00:19:10,329 --> 00:19:15,065
But the problem is
getting to absolute zero.

420
00:19:15,067 --> 00:19:17,468
We could use a laser cooling array.

421
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:18,983
The DOD just constructed one

422
00:19:18,986 --> 00:19:20,190
at their site outside of town.

423
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:21,520
- I could check it out.
- Okay, great.

424
00:19:21,522 --> 00:19:22,853
I'll get started on the serum.

425
00:19:22,856 --> 00:19:25,608
No, no, wait. Hold on.

426
00:19:25,611 --> 00:19:27,578
We... we can't just hack into

427
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:30,114
the DOD's $5 billion security system.

428
00:19:33,152 --> 00:19:35,619
Cisco.

429
00:19:35,621 --> 00:19:39,156
I just got my dad back.
I can't let him die.

430
00:19:41,727 --> 00:19:43,427
I'll see what I can do.

431
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,100
It's the fifth person to
be sliced up this week.

432
00:19:50,102 --> 00:19:53,604
Take him to OR Three.

433
00:20:09,722 --> 00:20:12,623
Oh, my God. What happened to you?

434
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:15,159
- I'm fine.
- I need to stitch that up.

435
00:20:15,161 --> 00:20:17,528
You've got abrasions,
possible internal injuries.

436
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:18,624
You keep going out there,

437
00:20:18,627 --> 00:20:20,294
you're gonna be back here in a body bag.

438
00:20:20,297 --> 00:20:23,991
You can't be a part of this.

439
00:20:23,994 --> 00:20:25,593
Do you know how many patients I've seen

440
00:20:25,596 --> 00:20:27,171
come in this hospital
the past four years

441
00:20:27,173 --> 00:20:28,819
because of those metas out there?

442
00:20:28,822 --> 00:20:30,290
I just treated a man who was attacked by

443
00:20:30,292 --> 00:20:31,831
a human razor blade, and you wanna say

444
00:20:31,834 --> 00:20:32,796
I'm not a part of this?

445
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,373
Oh, I got that razor meta.

446
00:20:34,376 --> 00:20:36,709
Just like I'll get the rest of them.

447
00:20:36,712 --> 00:20:38,882
I know why you're doing this.

448
00:20:38,885 --> 00:20:40,884
And I know that little
girl laying in a coma

449
00:20:40,887 --> 00:20:43,387
is not my family, but
you are not the only one

450
00:20:43,389 --> 00:20:45,222
whose heart breaks every
day she doesn't wake up.

451
00:20:45,224 --> 00:20:50,499
Grace is the one that
needs help. Not me.

452
00:20:50,502 --> 00:20:53,469
Now, are you gonna
get out of my way, Doc?

453
00:20:53,472 --> 00:20:56,574
Or are you gonna call security?

454
00:21:06,178 --> 00:21:08,522
What the heck happened back there?

455
00:21:08,525 --> 00:21:09,958
I froze up.

456
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,356
Look.

457
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:15,192
When I got canned from CCPD,

458
00:21:15,195 --> 00:21:19,731
I fell in with some legally
questionable individuals.

459
00:21:19,734 --> 00:21:22,257
These are some scary, scary people,

460
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,094
but they all had one thing in common.

461
00:21:25,097 --> 00:21:29,567
They were all terrified of
Ce-Seal-Your-Fate Horton.

462
00:21:29,569 --> 00:21:31,268
And I don't believe for one second that

463
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:33,585
that woman has gone anywhere.

464
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:37,408
Don't ever call me that again.

465
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:40,155
I'm sorry. Geez. I thought
I... I thought we were bonding

466
00:21:40,158 --> 00:21:42,979
and having a moment, but
I think I crossed the line.

467
00:21:42,982 --> 00:21:44,381
I didn't really mean to...

468
00:21:44,383 --> 00:21:47,280
I'm kidding. It's a joke. I was joking.

469
00:21:47,283 --> 00:21:49,252
My gosh, I really got you.

470
00:21:49,255 --> 00:21:51,310
You didn't have to get
so nervous about it.

471
00:21:51,313 --> 00:21:55,452
Nervous. Like the FEMA guy did.

472
00:21:55,455 --> 00:21:59,063
Ralph, I don't think
I froze up back there.

473
00:21:59,065 --> 00:22:02,132
Right. Right, you're...
You're an empath now.

474
00:22:02,134 --> 00:22:04,239
Your powers let you experience his fear.

475
00:22:04,242 --> 00:22:06,462
You're... you're the
Deanna Troi of Team Flash.

476
00:22:06,465 --> 00:22:08,631
I have no idea who that is,
but if he got that scared

477
00:22:08,634 --> 00:22:10,499
when we asked him about
the victims list...

478
00:22:10,502 --> 00:22:12,009
It's because he's hiding something.

479
00:22:12,011 --> 00:22:13,510
Yes.

480
00:22:13,512 --> 00:22:14,708
Whoa, whoa. What's, uh,

481
00:22:14,711 --> 00:22:16,812
what's happening with
your nose right now?

482
00:22:16,815 --> 00:22:19,413
Oh, when I smell a mystery,
that's my thing. I do that.

483
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:21,284
- That's nasty.
- It is? You don't...

484
00:22:21,287 --> 00:22:23,420
- Please stop.
- You don't like it?

485

♪ C'est l'aviron qui nous
mène, qui nous mène ♪

489
00:22:37,336 --> 00:22:40,971
He has been singing that same
song for the last two hours.

490
00:22:40,973 --> 00:22:41,860
I know, I know.

491
00:22:41,863 --> 00:22:44,307
Are you seriously making tea right now?

492
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:46,744
Le thé. Oui. Right, chamomile.

493
00:22:46,746 --> 00:22:49,346
You know, to stimulate the
brain, but also, frankly,

494
00:22:49,348 --> 00:22:51,081
the digestive system.

495
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:53,417
Right, because since
I've arrived at here,

496
00:22:53,419 --> 00:22:55,285
I've been backed up like a traffic jam.

497
00:22:55,287 --> 00:22:57,640
That is so disgusting.
Beyond disgusting.

498
00:22:57,643 --> 00:22:59,522
How are we supposed to investigate

499
00:22:59,525 --> 00:23:01,392
when you're making tea, Sherloque?

500
00:23:01,394 --> 00:23:03,494
Well, you seem very
annoyed, mademoiselle.

501
00:23:03,496 --> 00:23:05,829
- No shrap, Sherlock.
- Sherloque.

502
00:23:05,831 --> 00:23:08,832
Sorry for the language, Mom.

503
00:23:08,834 --> 00:23:10,534
It's okay.

504
00:23:10,536 --> 00:23:12,304
Hey, look.

505
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:15,240
There was a carnival the
night the satellite crashed.

506
00:23:15,243 --> 00:23:17,508
If my dad is right about Cicada
being a father, then maybe...

507
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,809
He might've brought his kid here.

508
00:23:18,811 --> 00:23:21,145
- Exactly.
- But, I mean, I ran all over this place.

509
00:23:21,147 --> 00:23:22,484
There's no core in sight.

510
00:23:22,487 --> 00:23:25,715
♪ C'est l'aviron qui nous
mène, qui nous mène ♪

511
00:23:27,253 --> 00:23:28,812
What if...

512
00:23:28,815 --> 00:23:30,720
The core fell into the water.

513
00:23:30,723 --> 00:23:32,132
How you will retrieve it?

514
00:23:32,135 --> 00:23:34,390
Nora, why don't you create
a vortex like your dad did

515
00:23:34,393 --> 00:23:35,422
when he fought King Shark?

516
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:38,194
Oh, no, or what if we do
what you did with the Hotness?

517
00:23:38,197 --> 00:23:39,445
You know about that?

518
00:23:39,448 --> 00:23:41,798
Yeah, of course. I made Papa
Joe tell me everything about

519
00:23:41,801 --> 00:23:43,534
when my mom was a speedster.

520
00:23:43,536 --> 00:23:45,402
So how do we do it?

521
00:23:45,404 --> 00:23:47,304
Um...

522
00:23:47,306 --> 00:23:51,218
Well, you just, um... you
run back and forth in a...

523
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:52,539
In a really tight formation.

524
00:23:52,542 --> 00:23:54,750
And you want to pull the
water up with your heels.

525
00:23:54,753 --> 00:23:57,081
Okay, right, which will drive
the water away from the shore.

526
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:58,082
Exactly.

527
00:23:58,084 --> 00:24:00,084
- Schway.
- Yeah.

528
00:24:00,086 --> 00:24:01,685
Do you think I can do it?

529
00:24:01,687 --> 00:24:03,787
Yeah, Nora, you got this.

530
00:24:03,789 --> 00:24:04,822
Okay.

531
00:24:10,429 --> 00:24:11,687
Four satellites?

532
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:13,730
Give them to Cisco. He's got 'em.

533
00:24:13,733 --> 00:24:18,102
DOD sites? There you go.
All in a day's work for him.

534
00:24:18,104 --> 00:24:20,604
You all think I can
just hack anything, huh?

535
00:24:29,882 --> 00:24:31,814
Yeah.

536
00:24:31,817 --> 00:24:33,751
I can hack anything.

537
00:24:40,292 --> 00:24:42,760
There you are.

538
00:24:42,762 --> 00:24:45,062
Oh!

539
00:25:15,876 --> 00:25:17,676
Found a path into the DOD base.

540
00:25:17,678 --> 00:25:20,751
As long as Cisco can shut down
the interior alarms, it'll work.

541
00:25:20,754 --> 00:25:22,314
Awesome. I just need
to balance this serum

542
00:25:22,316 --> 00:25:23,648
and we should be good to go.

543
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:25,216
Thank you for this, Caity.

544
00:25:25,218 --> 00:25:27,915
I mean, what you're
doing is beyond the call.

545
00:25:27,918 --> 00:25:29,287
Of course, you're my dad.

546
00:25:29,289 --> 00:25:31,222
I'd do anything for you.

547
00:25:31,224 --> 00:25:33,158
He's not your dad.

548
00:25:35,696 --> 00:25:37,128
Look familiar?

549
00:25:40,167 --> 00:25:42,534
Cisco. What are you talking about?

550
00:25:42,536 --> 00:25:45,670
This is my father.

551
00:25:45,672 --> 00:25:48,506
I went back to the
Tannhauser black ops site,

552
00:25:48,508 --> 00:25:49,941
and I picked up a vibe.

553
00:25:49,943 --> 00:25:51,810
I saw him working in the lab...

554
00:25:51,812 --> 00:25:54,185
Cisco, your vibes have
been a little problematic...

555
00:25:54,188 --> 00:25:57,115
I know what I saw. I saw him
standing over the incubator,

556
00:25:57,117 --> 00:25:58,850
the one he claimed he had no use for,

557
00:25:58,852 --> 00:26:00,219
and he was working on this.

558
00:26:00,222 --> 00:26:02,915
Skin grafts? What does this
have to do with anything?

559
00:26:02,918 --> 00:26:05,516
This is gonna sound whacked-out,

560
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:09,259
but what if, when you
dad tried to cure his ALS,

561
00:26:09,262 --> 00:26:11,696
it didn't just give
him crystallized skin?

562
00:26:11,698 --> 00:26:15,279
What if it really did
create that dual personality?

563
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:18,336
- This Killer Frost?
- That's who you think this is?

564
00:26:18,338 --> 00:26:21,039
Thomas' alter ego
wearing a copy of his face

565
00:26:21,041 --> 00:26:22,258
made out of these skin grafts?

566
00:26:22,261 --> 00:26:25,275
Yes, I know. I know it-it sounds...

567
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:27,912
It sounds absurd, but I can see where

568
00:26:27,914 --> 00:26:30,782
Mr. Ramon is getting his hypothesis.

569
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:36,388
My, uh, cryo-malignancy
spread further than I admitted,

570
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:41,149
and it's afflicted my face,
my hands, my arms, my chest.

571
00:26:41,152 --> 00:26:43,761
And I created those skin
grafts from stem cells

572
00:26:43,764 --> 00:26:44,899
that I found in the lab

573
00:26:44,902 --> 00:26:47,264
in order to cover any further outbreaks.

574
00:26:47,267 --> 00:26:48,440
You're lying to us.

575
00:26:48,443 --> 00:26:50,200
- Cisco...
- Caitlyn, you have to see...

576
00:26:50,203 --> 00:26:52,070
No, you need to leave us alone.

577
00:26:52,072 --> 00:26:54,105
- Please...
- Now!

578
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:03,882
I got it.

579
00:27:03,884 --> 00:27:06,084
Dude. Hey dude, we need to talk.

580
00:27:06,086 --> 00:27:08,987
Why? I thought that dramatic
confrontation worked perfectly.

581
00:27:08,989 --> 00:27:10,899
- We all want to help Caitlin.
- Oh, do you?

582
00:27:10,902 --> 00:27:13,058
Yeah, I want Caitlin to have
a chance to be with her father.

583
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,044
Just like Nora got the
chance to be with you?

584
00:27:15,047 --> 00:27:16,561
See, this is your problem.

585
00:27:16,563 --> 00:27:18,596
You think that this
is just another perfect

586
00:27:18,598 --> 00:27:20,665
father-daughter pairing, reunited.

587
00:27:20,667 --> 00:27:22,329
I'm not blinded by my feelings.

588
00:27:22,332 --> 00:27:24,069
Well, they're not helping
you see any clearer.

589
00:27:24,071 --> 00:27:26,271
You gotta stop thinking
about this like Nora's dad

590
00:27:26,273 --> 00:27:28,506
and start thinking about it like a CSI.

591
00:27:28,508 --> 00:27:30,975
Please?

592
00:27:30,977 --> 00:27:33,445
Don't do it for me. Do it for her.

593
00:27:44,291 --> 00:27:46,391
Didn't I tell you to get lost?

594
00:27:46,394 --> 00:27:48,325
Yes, you did. Thanks for that.

595
00:27:48,328 --> 00:27:50,261
Gave us time to pull your file.

596
00:27:50,263 --> 00:27:53,465
You don't have any priors,
but I did find about

597
00:27:53,467 --> 00:27:55,633
a dozen outstanding
parking tickets, though.

598
00:27:55,635 --> 00:27:56,657
Oh, no.

599
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,902
For, uh, what was it? It was, um...

600
00:27:58,905 --> 00:28:01,106
Oh, yeah, a Lamborghini.

601
00:28:01,108 --> 00:28:03,942
Hmm. Vroom, vroom.

602
00:28:03,944 --> 00:28:08,079
How does a civil servant
afford a $200,000 car?

603
00:28:08,081 --> 00:28:10,540
- Okay, I'm calling security.
- Please do.

604
00:28:10,543 --> 00:28:12,922
I can't wait to report a
case of insurance fraud.

605
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:15,252
You've been telling citizens
their claims have been denied

606
00:28:15,255 --> 00:28:16,855
and then pocketing the cash for yourself

607
00:28:16,857 --> 00:28:18,071
when the government pays up.

608
00:28:18,074 --> 00:28:20,657
That's why this FEMA center's
emptier than Grandma's whiskey

609
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,960
at a Dibny Christmas dinner.

610
00:28:21,962 --> 00:28:24,129
You can't prove any of this.

611
00:28:24,131 --> 00:28:25,630
Try me.

612
00:28:28,835 --> 00:28:30,219
That's everyone.

613
00:28:30,222 --> 00:28:32,971
Names, addresses, location
the night of the crash.

614
00:28:32,973 --> 00:28:36,074
So... this is gonna stay between us?

615
00:28:36,076 --> 00:28:38,843
You've been profiting
off of innocent victims.

616
00:28:38,845 --> 00:28:40,545
You know I put a call
into your superiors

617
00:28:40,547 --> 00:28:42,814
in D.C. 20 minutes ago.

618
00:28:42,816 --> 00:28:44,949
I got my groove back, Vancey.

619
00:28:44,951 --> 00:28:47,819
That's how I know it's you
that's scared and not me.

620
00:28:47,821 --> 00:28:50,155
Now there's the old
Ce-Seal-Your-Fate Horton

621
00:28:50,157 --> 00:28:51,723
- we all know and love.
- Hmm, great.

622
00:28:51,725 --> 00:28:52,991
Hmm.

623
00:29:51,184 --> 00:29:53,017
Hey.

624
00:29:53,019 --> 00:29:55,833
If you came to defend
Cisco, please don't bother.

625
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:57,704
He just cares about you.

626
00:29:57,707 --> 00:29:58,978
Come on, don't you think I wouldn't know

627
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,813
if that wasn't actually my father?

628
00:30:02,896 --> 00:30:04,462
You too? Really?

629
00:30:04,464 --> 00:30:08,099
Listen, I wanted to
believe that that's your dad

630
00:30:08,101 --> 00:30:10,568
and that he's a good guy
because I want you to be happy.

631
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:12,937
But I don't... I don't know.

632
00:30:12,939 --> 00:30:14,906
Maybe I haven't been seeing clearly.

633
00:30:14,908 --> 00:30:17,475
There is a lot about this
guy's story that doesn't add up.

634
00:30:17,477 --> 00:30:20,245
This guy? This guy is my father.

635
00:30:20,247 --> 00:30:22,513
He's the man who held
me when I had chickenpox.

636
00:30:22,515 --> 00:30:24,482
Who told me I could
be anything I wanted to

637
00:30:24,484 --> 00:30:26,484
and made me believe it.

638
00:30:26,486 --> 00:30:29,454
So please stop treating
him like he's a criminal.

639
00:30:29,456 --> 00:30:31,322
Okay.

640
00:30:31,324 --> 00:30:33,691
You know how estranged
I am from my mother

641
00:30:33,693 --> 00:30:37,729
and how empty I felt
without Killer Frost.

642
00:30:37,731 --> 00:30:41,266
He is the only family that I have left.

643
00:30:41,268 --> 00:30:44,836
But Caitlin, that's not
true. We're your family too.

644
00:30:44,838 --> 00:30:48,036
And we're only asking
you to keep an open mind

645
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:49,973
because we care about you.

646
00:30:49,976 --> 00:30:51,676
Especially Cisco.

647
00:30:55,916 --> 00:30:57,315
If it'll make you feel better,

648
00:30:57,317 --> 00:30:58,583
you can ask him your questions,

649
00:30:58,585 --> 00:31:00,852
but only after I give him the serum.

650
00:31:03,823 --> 00:31:05,623
- What's wrong?
- Oh, my God.

651
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:06,858
What?

652
00:31:08,695 --> 00:31:11,429
If I give this serum to a human,

653
00:31:11,431 --> 00:31:13,998
it will suppress their malignant side.

654
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,468
But if I give it to a
cryogenic meta-human,

655
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:19,904
it will permanently
suppress their human side.

656
00:31:19,906 --> 00:31:21,639
If that's your father's alter ego...

657
00:31:21,641 --> 00:31:23,041
He's trying to wipe out my dad.

658
00:31:23,043 --> 00:31:25,376
He needed your cells to make the serum.

659
00:31:27,347 --> 00:31:30,248
"Caitlin, come find me."

660
00:31:33,753 --> 00:31:35,253
Caity.

661
00:31:35,255 --> 00:31:36,421
What's going on?

662
00:31:36,423 --> 00:31:39,424
Dad, why?

663
00:31:39,426 --> 00:31:44,495
Well... I guess, as you're all here...

664
00:31:48,501 --> 00:31:51,703
You have such smart friends, Caity.

665
00:31:55,976 --> 00:31:57,709
That frozen liquid in your lungs

666
00:31:57,711 --> 00:32:00,578
is gonna be turning into tiny icicles.

667
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:03,481
Making it very difficult
for you to breathe.

668
00:32:03,483 --> 00:32:05,984
But no worries.

669
00:32:05,986 --> 00:32:08,353
You'll pass out soon.

670
00:32:23,955 --> 00:32:26,188
Caitlin. Hey!

671
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:28,791
Caitlin, wake up.

672
00:32:28,793 --> 00:32:31,160
- Hey, are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.

673
00:32:31,162 --> 00:32:32,795
Um, is my dad gone?

674
00:32:32,797 --> 00:32:34,296
He took the serum.

675
00:32:34,298 --> 00:32:35,731
This is all my fault.

676
00:32:35,733 --> 00:32:37,500
I was so excited to have my dad back

677
00:32:37,502 --> 00:32:40,136
that I... I couldn't
see who he really was.

678
00:32:40,138 --> 00:32:42,004
I owe you both an apology.

679
00:32:42,006 --> 00:32:45,207
Hey, it's okay.

680
00:32:45,209 --> 00:32:47,176
We'll get him.

681
00:32:47,178 --> 00:32:48,911
Hey, guys, get in here.

682
00:32:48,913 --> 00:32:51,213
Come on.

683
00:32:51,215 --> 00:32:53,682
Eyes, please.

684
00:32:53,684 --> 00:32:55,050
- What?
- He's at the DOD site.

685
00:32:55,052 --> 00:32:56,185
Look.

686
00:32:56,187 --> 00:32:57,376
That building's 7 below?

687
00:32:57,379 --> 00:32:58,846
Look at the temperature.
Look at it drop.

688
00:32:58,848 --> 00:32:59,949
He initiated the negative array

689
00:32:59,951 --> 00:33:00,937
but didn't seal it.

690
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:03,372
The room is -7, but
the array is -100.

691
00:33:03,375 --> 00:33:05,295
That thing's so freaking cold,
it's freezing the whole building.

692
00:33:05,297 --> 00:33:06,903
Wait, at this rate, in 5 minutes,

693
00:33:06,906 --> 00:33:08,897
the temperature will be 460 degrees,

694
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,044
AKA absolute zero.

695
00:33:10,047 --> 00:33:12,283
At which point, he can
inject himself with my serum.

696
00:33:12,286 --> 00:33:14,537
And turn himself into a full-on icicle.

697
00:33:14,539 --> 00:33:16,338
Icicle, that's... Not the time.

698
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,653
- We gotta go.
- Let's do it.

699
00:33:17,656 --> 00:33:20,375
Hey, what... What about your hands?

700
00:33:20,378 --> 00:33:24,413
You're my friend, my family. I'm going.

701
00:33:31,756 --> 00:33:33,255
Almost there.

702
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:41,730
Ugh... Flash.

703
00:33:41,732 --> 00:33:45,234
Don't you realize that
speed and cold don't mix?

704
00:33:45,236 --> 00:33:48,103
This machine is capable
of producing isotopes

705
00:33:48,105 --> 00:33:51,497
that can freeze carbon dioxide.

706
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,508
You can't run in here.

707
00:33:56,547 --> 00:33:58,848
More superheroes to freeze.

708
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:01,525
The array's at -220.
You have one minute.

709
00:34:01,528 --> 00:34:03,752
You people are not
as smart as I thought.

710
00:34:03,754 --> 00:34:04,966
Guys, what's happening?

711
00:34:04,969 --> 00:34:06,212
The temperature in the room is dropping.

712
00:34:06,214 --> 00:34:08,523
Everyone's so cold, their
atoms are hitting near stasis.

713
00:34:08,526 --> 00:34:11,260
Why... why can't I see my breath?

714
00:34:11,262 --> 00:34:14,697
It's too cold. There's
no moisture in the air.

715
00:34:17,101 --> 00:34:18,534
Cisco, are you okay?

716
00:34:18,536 --> 00:34:21,370
No. At least I can't feel anything.

717
00:34:21,372 --> 00:34:23,572
Guys, the array's at -350 degrees.

718
00:34:23,574 --> 00:34:25,341
He's gonna be able to
go full icicle soon.

719
00:34:26,577 --> 00:34:27,762
Come on.

720
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:29,978
- Forty-five seconds.
- What do we do?

721
00:34:29,981 --> 00:34:31,169
Lightning.

722
00:34:31,172 --> 00:34:32,639
Use your lightning to counter the cold

723
00:34:32,641 --> 00:34:34,407
and maybe you can warm
up enough to stop him.

724
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:35,928
We've been trying to
do it this whole time.

725
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:37,162
It's too cold.

726
00:34:37,165 --> 00:34:39,499
I'm literally fr... freezing.

727
00:34:39,502 --> 00:34:41,161
399, you have 30 seconds.

728
00:34:41,164 --> 00:34:42,498
Your temperature is
dropping too quickly.

729
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,292
You're gonna go into
hypothermic shock soon.

730
00:34:44,295 --> 00:34:45,761
But not Caitlin.

731
00:34:45,763 --> 00:34:48,197
Look, Caitlin's body
temperature is normal.

732
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,820
Caitlin, you must be immune.

733
00:34:49,823 --> 00:34:51,423
But Killer Frost is gone.

734
00:34:51,426 --> 00:34:53,636
Well, clearly, she's not.

735
00:34:53,638 --> 00:34:56,405
Guys, 400 degrees. We got 20 seconds.

736
00:34:56,407 --> 00:34:58,908
Caitlin, you can do it.

737
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:00,609
Just concentrate.

738
00:35:03,014 --> 00:35:04,313
Dad!

739
00:35:05,182 --> 00:35:08,083
Please, I know you're in there.

740
00:35:08,085 --> 00:35:09,652
Don't do this.

741
00:35:09,654 --> 00:35:12,454
Do you think Thomas can hear you, Caity?

742
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:18,293
Thomas hasn't been able to hear
anything for a very long time.

743
00:35:23,467 --> 00:35:26,168
- What is that?
- 460 degrees. We're too late.

744
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:28,003
He beat us.

745
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,040
No!

746
00:35:38,583 --> 00:35:42,818
My daughter. You've returned!

747
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:45,231
You're not my family. They are.

748
00:35:45,234 --> 00:35:48,111
You only gave a damn about me
because you wanted that serum.

749
00:35:48,114 --> 00:35:50,326
But I... I can share it with you.

750
00:35:50,328 --> 00:35:51,567
Just imagine.

751
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:54,997
The two of us, free to
be ourselves without fear.

752
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,666
You are strong.

753
00:35:56,669 --> 00:35:59,201
We can be even stronger together.

754
00:35:59,203 --> 00:36:02,275
I'm strong because I
have people in my life

755
00:36:02,278 --> 00:36:04,139
who actually care about me.

756
00:36:04,141 --> 00:36:06,742
Do you?

757
00:36:06,744 --> 00:36:08,210
No!

758
00:36:13,818 --> 00:36:15,028
No!

759
00:36:26,263 --> 00:36:28,430
Caity?

760
00:36:28,432 --> 00:36:30,966
- Dad?
- You found me?

761
00:36:47,148 --> 00:36:48,915
Temperature's rising.

762
00:36:48,918 --> 00:36:50,517
What's happening? Is everyone okay?

763
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,287
- I think so.
- A little help?

764
00:36:52,289 --> 00:36:54,323
Get Cisco.

765
00:36:57,261 --> 00:36:58,927
Oh, yeah. That's good.

766
00:36:58,929 --> 00:37:01,063
Yeah.

767
00:37:01,065 --> 00:37:02,264
Okay.

768
00:37:06,537 --> 00:37:08,470
My dad.

769
00:37:08,472 --> 00:37:09,972
Our dad.

770
00:37:09,974 --> 00:37:15,744
He was here, but... I lost him.

771
00:37:15,746 --> 00:37:18,647
We'll get him back. Together.

772
00:37:18,649 --> 00:37:20,249
You're not alone anymore.

773
00:37:27,158 --> 00:37:28,457
Neither am I.

774
00:37:38,611 --> 00:37:40,544
No cold signatures in the area.

775
00:37:40,547 --> 00:37:42,814
Snow Country for Old
Men must be miles away,

776
00:37:42,816 --> 00:37:44,623
'cause he sure as hell
isn't in Central City.

777
00:37:44,626 --> 00:37:45,743
Well, we have to find him.

778
00:37:45,746 --> 00:37:48,785
I mean, Icicle wouldn't have
gone through all this trouble

779
00:37:48,788 --> 00:37:51,489
to kill my Dad if there wasn't
a piece of him still left.

780
00:37:51,491 --> 00:37:53,958
We'll find him.

781
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:57,228
All the things I vibed, they
weren't memories of your dad.

782
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,963
They were of his alter ego.

783
00:37:58,965 --> 00:38:01,861
My dad was trying to protect me.

784
00:38:01,867 --> 00:38:05,268
You know what? My mom probably was too.

785
00:38:05,271 --> 00:38:07,805
I mean, she was just
trying to keep me safe.

786
00:38:07,807 --> 00:38:10,208
All this time, I thought
she was the villain.

787
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:12,110
How could I not see it was him?

788
00:38:12,112 --> 00:38:14,245
Hey, don't beat yourself up.

789
00:38:14,247 --> 00:38:16,447
Thawne. Zolomon.

790
00:38:16,449 --> 00:38:18,750
We see the good in people.
That's just who we are.

791
00:38:18,752 --> 00:38:21,719
I hope that never changes.

792
00:38:21,721 --> 00:38:23,993
There's something else
you guys should see.

793
00:38:27,594 --> 00:38:29,961
All this time, we've
been trying to figure out

794
00:38:29,963 --> 00:38:31,963
how Killer Frost disappeared,

795
00:38:31,965 --> 00:38:35,366
but we've been looking at it all wrong.

796
00:38:35,368 --> 00:38:38,136
We've been thinking DeVoe
used Melting Point's powers,

797
00:38:38,138 --> 00:38:40,104
that he changed your meta DNA

798
00:38:40,106 --> 00:38:42,473
and removed Killer Frost from you.

799
00:38:42,475 --> 00:38:45,777
But tonight, you proved that
she's still a part of you.

800
00:38:45,779 --> 00:38:48,780
So what caused her to leave?

801
00:38:48,782 --> 00:38:51,682
DeVoe used a different set of powers.

802
00:38:51,684 --> 00:38:54,719
- Brainstorm.
- Brainstorm.

803
00:38:54,721 --> 00:38:56,387
All they did was create a mental block.

804
00:38:56,389 --> 00:38:58,322
One you broke through tonight,
so you can do that again.

805
00:38:58,324 --> 00:39:01,626
You just gotta learn how.

806
00:39:01,628 --> 00:39:04,028
I think it's time we
reintroduce an old friend.

807
00:39:06,266 --> 00:39:08,800
Harry's mental activity dampener.

808
00:39:08,802 --> 00:39:10,802
It'll help me hear her.

809
00:39:10,804 --> 00:39:12,303
That's right.

810
00:39:12,305 --> 00:39:14,639
It's my hope that the more you use it,

811
00:39:14,641 --> 00:39:16,874
the more you connect with her.

812
00:39:16,876 --> 00:39:19,444
Eventually, you won't need it anymore.

813
00:39:19,446 --> 00:39:21,779
Thank you.

814
00:39:21,781 --> 00:39:25,383
Guys, we need you in the Speed Lab.

815
00:39:25,385 --> 00:39:28,853
All right. We'll leave you to it.

816
00:39:39,732 --> 00:39:42,099
Hey, stranger.

817
00:39:42,101 --> 00:39:43,734
Hey.

818
00:39:43,736 --> 00:39:46,437
Well, we sure have a lot to talk about.

819
00:39:50,876 --> 00:39:54,744
Oh! Sally's heart!

820
00:39:54,747 --> 00:39:56,781
You brought it back.

821
00:39:56,783 --> 00:39:59,317
We did, thanks to these two

822
00:39:59,319 --> 00:40:01,196
and their deductive abilities.

823
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:03,693
And our tidal-wave-breaking skills. Right?

824
00:40:03,696 --> 00:40:05,990
- Like mother, like daughter.
- Mm-hmm.

825
00:40:05,992 --> 00:40:08,526
Uh, is it safe for this to be here?

826
00:40:08,528 --> 00:40:10,907
Yeah, a little dark
matter never hurt anybody.

827
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:12,282
What?

828
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:14,431
We've seen this puzzle piece before.

829
00:40:14,434 --> 00:40:18,236
Our satellite giveth, and
now we must taketh away.

830
00:40:18,238 --> 00:40:20,538
I think we can finally do that.

831
00:40:20,541 --> 00:40:22,940
We got a list from FEMA of
everyone who reported injuries

832
00:40:22,942 --> 00:40:24,006
the night of the Enlightenment.

833
00:40:24,008 --> 00:40:25,681
None of them matched
Cicada's description.

834
00:40:25,684 --> 00:40:26,950
But there were three kids

835
00:40:26,953 --> 00:40:29,011
who were hit by pieces of
shrapnel from the satellite.

836
00:40:29,013 --> 00:40:31,248
Two of them are twins
whose father is deceased.

837
00:40:31,251 --> 00:40:32,750
Third is a ten-year-old girl,

838
00:40:32,752 --> 00:40:34,519
by the name of Grace Gibbons.

839
00:40:34,521 --> 00:40:37,121
So if my dad's right and
Cicada's a father, then...

840
00:40:37,123 --> 00:40:40,925
We may have just found his daughter.

841
00:40:46,132 --> 00:40:47,732
Orlin?

842
00:40:54,641 --> 00:40:56,173
Orlin.

843
00:41:08,254 --> 00:41:11,034
After I fix up your side,
I'm gonna patch up your chest.

844
00:41:11,037 --> 00:41:12,623
No.

845
00:41:23,264 --> 00:41:26,337
It's making me stronger.

846
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:32,490
