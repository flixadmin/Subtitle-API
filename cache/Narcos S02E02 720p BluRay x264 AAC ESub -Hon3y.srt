You mentioned making some changes.
What exactly does that mean?

with their kid. He didn't make it.

I am Fernando Duque.

[in Spanish] Mr. Duque...

I believe the whole world
has the right to a fair trial.

226
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:03,171
Pablo Escobar has the same rights
as any other Colombian.

227
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:09,241
If he has committed a crime,
he must be judged and indicted.

228

He can't be hunted and killed

229

Mr. De Greiff,

230
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:21,807
everything you're telling me I find...
fascinating.

231

However, I don't...

232
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:30,170
I don't buckle under the pressure
of the Americans...

233

Then that means that...

you would consider...
making a deal with Pablo.

237
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:47,966
I am saying that Colombia...

238
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,530
has been at war far too long.

239
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,566
Of course.

240
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,971
The Americans are bringing in new people.

241
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,601
Different faces but, ultimately,
with the same motivation.

242
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,724
They are using us
to advance their political agenda.

243
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,770
Perhaps.

244
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,200
But the reality is we have to accept help
wherever it comes from.

245
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,371
And right now,
the gringos are very limited,

That's right.

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,603
- Excuse me?
- Tell me something.

308
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:34,127
Why did you need to be there
that night at La Catedral?

309
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:39,448
Why was the presence of
the vice minister of justice necessary

310
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,885
to transfer a prisoner?

311
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,970
[sighs] Because we're not talking about
any prisoner, Attorney General.

312
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,281
We're talking about Pablo Escobar.

313
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,170
And I was only following the orders
of the president.

314
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,288
I don't think that's true.

315
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,242
Are you insinuating something,
Attorney General?

316
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,928
- Are you accusing me of something?
- No, I'm not accusing you of anything.

317
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,128
At least, not yet.

318
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,565
But I'm going to open up an investigation
about the allegations...

319
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:19,600
that, possibly,
you helped Pablo Escobar escape.

320
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,643
You know what, Attorney General?

321
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,080
Eat shit.

322
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,286
[door closes]

323
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,576
- [Limén] What the hell are we doing here?
- [La Quica] Running an errand, brother.

324
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,922
- What errand?
- For Don Pablo, brother.

325
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,961
Hello, hello.

326
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,327
Hello, gentlemen,
can I help you with something?

327
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,530
Of course, brother, I'm here to pick up
a package, under the name Alvarez.

328
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,728
Ah, yes, sir. Right away, with pleasure.

329
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,131
Go ahead.

330
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:00,322
Brother... let's give up on the girl.
She's not coming back. Hm?

331
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,370
Are you afraid or what, Limén? Huh?

332
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,486
Close your fucking mouth
and do what I say.

333
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,130
- [man] Mr. Alvarez.
- [clears throat, coughs]

334
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,122
Quica!

335
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,761
[man] This is the best toilet they make.
You really know your shit.

336
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,001
Brother!

337
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,643
That's what I'm talking about, brother.

338
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,085
Good.

339
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,004
Boys, put it in the car.
We've got some business to take care of.

340
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:43,607
I am going to take out her eyes
and make her eat them, that rat bitch.

341
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,240
- What number?
- Room three. I already told you.

342
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,320
[buzzing]

343
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,856
Son of a bitch. You told me
that she was going to be here.

344
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,202
[Limén] I don't know, brother.
I think this is where she lives.

345
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,805
[slams door]

346
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,609
[buzzing]

347
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,562
She's not there.
Anyway, tomorrow is better.

348
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,005
We'll come back later.

349
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,208
Fuck that, brother.

350
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,081
Quica!

351
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,925
Over there, brother.

352
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,848
[objects clattering]

353
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,644
[La Quica]
I got something, brother.

354
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:17,088
That bitch. I'm going to rip out her
tongue and shove it up her ass, brother.

355
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,687
I told you she wasn't here.
At this hour, she's already working.

356
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,081
- This is bullshit, brother.
- She's not here.

357
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,049
[La Quica]
We'll come back later, then.

358
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,122
[retreating footsteps]

359
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,442
If the president
doesn't agree with the deal,

360
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,000
then we haven't won anything. Right?

361
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:41,643
Pablo, we have found a very good option.

362
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,165
Definitely.

363
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,289
If you allow me to negotiate
with De Greiff

364
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,409
- and create some dissention in the ranks...
- Oh, Fernando.

365
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,721
That's not why I pay you, Fernando.

366
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,970
You pay me to strategize
and that's exactly what I am doing.

367
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,602
Pablo, you have to understand...

368
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,324
[stammering] The m0ment... The position
that Gaviria is in right now...

369
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:12,043
What happened at La Catedral
was a humiliating failure for him.

370
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,684
Right now, he's thinking
that capturing you is his only option.

371
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,250
And he's not thinking about

372
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:27,043
trying to find some way
to speak with us, but...

373
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,766
De Greiff, he is willing to speak.

374
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,890
And he has the autonomy to make deals.

375
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,444
Fine, okay.

376
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,720
Let's try it.

377
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,846
You're not going to believe it,
but the attorney general

378
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,048
supports the legalization of drugs.

379
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,327
- Don't bullshit me.
- Lt's true.

380
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:05,130
Trust me, Pablo, little by little,
with patience, with time...

381
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,407
What we don't have is time, Fernando.

382
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,726
Fernando, excuse us.

383
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,643
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

384
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,085
- Blackie.
- [Blackie] Yes, sir.

385
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,925
Thank you very much, Fernando.

386
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,842
- Thank you very much.
- Yes.

387
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,081
Excuse me.

388
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,800
What's wrong?

389
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,129
We can't live like this, Pablo.

390
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,049
Running from one place to another, hiding,

391
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,924
hoping the government wants to negotiate.

392
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,162
Gaviria is going to negotiate, Tata.

393
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,526
He's too intelligent and too weak not to.

394
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,163
How are you so calm, huh?

395
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,767
Pablo, if Gaviria doesn't want you in jail
then we know perfectly well what he wants.

396
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,765
I think it's time for us
to leave Colombia.

397
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,889
I know we agreed we would never leave,
but things have changed.

398
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,849
No, nothing has changed.

399
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:34,403
My love, we have everything we need.

400
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,404
Let's get the children
and go to some other place.

401
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,846
A place where we don't have to hide.

402
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,927
We're not going to
spend our lives in hiding.

403
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,609
I promise you that.

404
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,845
Get ready to get your balls snipped.

405
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:20,241
So... your wife left.

406
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,764
You're upset,
knocked a few back to numb the pain

407
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,447
and then decide to take it out
on some Wall Street scumbag.

408
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,649
Yeah, something like that.

409
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,368
Isolated incident?

410
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,766
Yeah.

411
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:44,129
Look, I know I've been in Colombia
for all of about 20 seconds.

412
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,645
Mm.

413
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,850
Before that, you and Pefia had
complete autonomy to call your own shots.

414
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:55,322
It's gonna take you a minute
to get used to the new order.

415
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,528
You don't trust me yet? That's fine.

416
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,290
But if I'm gonna have your back,
I need to know that I can trust you.

417
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,603
Otherwise, I have no problem
sending you back to your wife in Miami.

418
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,688
Am I making myself clear?

419
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,564

out of your sight. Over.

They saw La Quica buying a toilet.

426
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:43,966
[in English]
I got "La Quica" and "toilet."

427
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,122
[in Spanish]
Not just any toilet.

428
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,363

at La Catedral. A Kohler.

All right, well, now, that I got.

We can't take that to Pinzén.
He'll laugh us out of the office.

We need more.

- But what else, Pefia?
- Where did they see him?

433
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,767
Going toward the hills on San Isidro Road.

434
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,120

get Centra Spike to do a flyover,

We're looking for any chatter

What's here is fincas, fincas.

Everything else is just smaller houses
here, here and here, and the outskirts.

458
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,003
You can probably eliminate
the smaller ones, not Escobar's style.

Which of the fincas have road access

This one here.

461

It's rough terrain down the back
of the mountain, but it's drivable.

[Steve]
It's gotta be the one.

463
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,600
We'd have a good chance
if we came at him from both sides.

This is good.

Great. What about Pinzén?

466
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,801
We're gonna need vehicles,
we're gonna need men.

467

Leave Pinzén to me.

[in Spanish] That was based on

473
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:09,323
This is the voice of Velasco.

474

Ms. Messina, apparently
you think my men work for you.

475
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:17,042
You are mistaken. I don't work for you.

I decide how we are going
to work together. ls that clear?

And I already know what happened
to the last man that worked with you,

478
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,088
Colonel Carrillo.

479
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,969
He was exiled to Spain.

480
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,526
What did he say?

481
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,970
He said no.

482

She gives up pretty fuckin' easy.

487

- Pinzén was <i>gettin'</i> a <i>kick in</i> the ass.

488

[in Spanish]
Colonel, General Silva is on the phone.

489

He liked kicking down the front door,</i>

497
