1
00:00:05,439 --> 00:00:06,713
Cactus 1549.

2
00:00:06,874 --> 00:00:08,615
<i>Runway four. Cleared for takeoff.</i>

3
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:11,521
<i>Cactus 1549. Cleared for takeoff.</i>

7
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,304
Mayday, mayday. Cactus 1549.

8
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:32,967
We've lost both engines. Both engines.

10
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:38,981
No relight on one or two.

11
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:40,345
<i>Cactus 1549, 
if we can get it for you,</i>

12
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:42,145
<i>do you wanna try 
to land runway 1-3?</i>

13
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:43,344
Departure control, we can make it.

14
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,751
We're turning back towards LaGuardia.

16
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:04,999
<i>LaGuardia Tower, Cactus 1549,
trying to make 1-3.</i>

17
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:08,369
Sully, we're too low.

19
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:09,741
Come on.

21
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:21,552
Just a little farther.

22
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:24,594
Come on.

25
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:33,364
Lorrie, I love you.

30
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,421
What the hell's the matter with you?

33
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:20,005
<i>The on board count, 150 passengers,</i>

34
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:22,374
<i>three flight attendants
and two pilots, one of whom,</i>

35
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:25,415
<i>the senior pilot, drew on
all of his experience and skill,</i>

36
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:27,984
<i>which combined with
near-miraculous good luck</i>

37
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:29,882
<i>and</i> a result that was,
frankly, astounding.</i>

38
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,852
<i>There were some non-critical injuries,</i>

39
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,081
<i>but everyone, everyone, survived.</i>

40
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:37,353
<i>The first pictures
of US Airways Flight 1549 reveal...</i>

41
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:40,862
<i>You think that you're gonna die.
That's what you think.</i>

42
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:43,558
<i>And then, miraculously, you don't.</i>

43
00:03:44,091 --> 00:04:01,686
Thank you, Captain.
Everybody, thank you.

47
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:03,879
Thank you, Captain Sullenberger,
for being here today.

48
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:06,183
We also wanna welcome
First Officer Skiles.

49
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:07,689
I'm glad you could make it 
this morning.

50
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:09,792
Not as glad as we are.

52
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:14,054
For the record, we had an 
Aircraft Systems Team on this investigation.

54
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:17,933
Also Aircraft Structures, MRT,
Aircraft Performance, ATC,

56
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,072
Wildlife Factors, Survival Factors
and Emergency Response.

57
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:24,869
Today, we begin with our operation
and human performance investigation

58
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:27,272
on the crash 
of US Airways Flight 1549.

59
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,710
- Water landing.
- Captain?

60
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,713
This was not a crash
and it wasn't a ditching.

61
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:34,950
We knew what we're
trying to execute here.

62
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:38,448
It was not a crash.
It was a forced water landing.

64
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:41,450
Why didn't you attempt
to return to LaGuardia?

65
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:45,423
There simply was 
not enough altitude.

66
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:48,225
The Hudson was the only place
that was long enough and smooth enough

67
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:50,732
and wide enough to even attempt
to land the airplane safely.

68
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:55,564
Air Traffic testified that you stated,
you were returning to LaGuardia, but you didn't.

71
00:04:56,463 --> 00:05:02,069
As I began the left turn,
I realized I couldn't make it back.

73
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:04,010
It would have eliminated
all the other options.

74
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:06,082
Returning to LaGuardia
would have been a mistake.

75
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,617
Let's get into how you
calculated all those parameters.

76
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:09,947
There was no time for calculating.

77
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:13,649
I had to rely on my experience
of managing the altitude and speed

78
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,919
of thousands of flights over four decades.

79
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:19,130
You're saying you didn't do any...
- I eyeballed it.

81
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:23,499
You eyeballed it?
- Yes.

83
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,638
The best chance those passengers had
was on that river.

84
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,103
And I'd bet my life on it.
In fact, I did.

86
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,007
And I would do it again.

87
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,974
Aviation engineers are theorizing

88
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:36,171
you had enough energy
to make it back to a runway.

89
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:41,611
Engineers are not pilots.
They're wrong.

91
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:43,521
And they weren't there.

92
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:46,020
Regardless, we have to follow up
on all implications,

93
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,783
as part of our investigation.

94
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:50,451
Our computers will run
return scenario algorithms.

95
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:53,154
It'll generate simulations
with your exact parameters.

96
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,197
The dual engine loss, the altitude.

97
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,631
Everything you faced
when you made your decision.

98
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:00,067
I would like to oversee
those computer simulations.

99
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:01,706
Not possible during an investigation.

100
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,573
You stated that it was
a dual engine failure

101
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:07,041
due to multiple bird strikes?

102
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,043
That would be unprecedented.

103
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:13,517
Everything is unprecedented
until it happens for the first time.

104
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,483
How much sleep did you get
the night before?

105
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:20,056
Eight hours. Enough.

106
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,920
Is it possible your blood sugar was low?

107
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:24,995
I was rested, alert and 
completely aware of my surroundings.

108
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:27,158
When was your last drink,
Captain Sullenberger?

109
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,321
Nine days ago.

110
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:29,489
Drugs?

111
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:30,690
No. Never.

112
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:32,165
First Officer Skiles?

113
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,339
I don't drink. Never have.

114
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:41,607
Captain, have you had
any troubles at home lately?

115
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,772
No more than anyone else.

116
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:47,009
And nothing that affected my work.

117
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,755
It's bullshit.

118
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:57,418
Why are they looking for something
we did wrong when it all turned out right?

119
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:58,688
It didn't turn out all right
for the airline

120
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:00,126
and their insurance company.

121
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:02,028
We should expect some blowback.

122
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:05,067
Come on, Mike. What are they gonna say?
That he shouldn't have saved everybody?

123
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:07,865
It's not personal.
NTSB's just doing its job.

124
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:10,907
Once they have all the facts,
it'll calm down.

125
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:15,471
They should pin on the medal
and send you back to work.

127
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:17,046
Sorry. This mailbox is full.

128
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:20,377
I didn't call Lorrie since this morning.
Apparently everyone else did.

129
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:23,915
Not meaning to bother, but I have to say,

130
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:26,057
it is an honor driving you today.

131
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:27,790
Thank you.

132
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,723
What has it been this year so far?

133
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:33,490
Bernie Madoff, two wars without end.
Many million new people with no work.

134
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:35,894
And that's just the first
two weeks of January.

135
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:39,896
Friday's headline? This is beautiful.

137
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:45,408
Mike, how about we add
the driver as a character witness?

142
00:07:57,444 --> 00:07:58,479
Finally.

143
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,249
Yeah, finally.

144
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:02,689
The NTSB had us tied up all day.

145
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:08,459
I just needed to hear your voice.
Been hearing everybody else's.

148
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:14,301
You'd be amazed how many cousins you have.
- Doesn't feel much like family here.

151
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,541
Pretty quiet here, too.

152
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:25,773
The reporters want me to give an update
inside the mind of Sully.

153
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:27,312
What should I tell them?

154
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:29,044
Tell them you're not
allowed to talk to anybody.

155
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:30,813
I can't hear you.

156
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:32,854
Call me back.
- I'm trying to tell you...

157
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:34,116
...you don't have to talk to anybody.

158
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,953
I can't hear you. Call back.

161
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:46,369
Captain <i>Sully.</i>

165
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,537
How did you pull off the impossible?

170
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:12,190
I'm thinking about
running the press over with the car.

171
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:14,525
Self-defense.
You think a jury would convict?

172
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:15,995
Just do what you have to do.

173
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:19,194
I'm taking that as permission.
The cops will be coming after you.

174
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,032
<i>...Sullenberger couldn't be here.</i>

175
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:23,196
<i>He is not able 
to speak to the media,</i>

176
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:27,004
<i>while the NTSB
is conducting its investigation.</i>

177
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,773
Are you listening to me?
- Maybe we should talk later.

179
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:36,016
It is later.
I've been waiting all day.

180
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:39,717
Are you okay?
- Just tired, that's all.

182
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,415
How are the girls?

183
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:47,461
A little overwhelmed.
It sounds like you are, too.

187
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:51,896
They'll be all right.

188
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,599
It is a lot.
- Yes, it is.

190
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,568
<i>Those missing engines were definitely 
not what investigators wanted...</i>

192
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:04,915
The whole world is talking about you.
I can't believe this.

195
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:09,914
I have to stay here longer
for the NTSB investigation.

197
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:13,888
Did I tell you that already?
I apologize if I didn't.

198
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:18,586
There's no need to apologize.
You're right where you need to be.

199
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:24,058
I want you to know,
I did the best I could.

200
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:29,904
Of course you did. 
You saved everyone.

201
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:35,573
Maybe we should just 
talk in the morning, I'm tired.

202
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:42,777
I'm overwhelmed by all this attention.
- I'm gonna be on TV in the morning.

205
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:44,819
What are they gonna ask me?
What am I gonna say?

206
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,083
Do you want me to come be with you?

207
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:54,254
No. Thanks, but the girls need you.
Tell them I love them.

210
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:59,330
I love you. Get some sleep.

212
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,938
Maybe when I wake up,
it'll be January 14th.

213
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:06,642
Wouldn't that be good?
Love you.

215
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,846
<i>Why Captain Sullenberger
made that fateful decision,</i>

216
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:20,316
<i>to turn the Hudson into a runway?
Only he can answer.</i>

218
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,121
<i>But we now know 
it was the <i>wrong</i> choice.</i>

219
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:28,360
<i>A choice that endangered the lives
of all of those on board.</i>

220
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:32,298
<i>So, while much of the country
hails him as a hero,</i>

221
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,496
<i>this new information will certainly
change everyone's understanding</i>

222
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:40,033
<i>of the so-called
"Miracle on the Hudson."</i>

223
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,149
<i>Sully Sullenberger,
are you a hero or a fraud?</i>

225
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:05,995
- Hello?
- Jeff?

226
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:10,204
Sorry to call so late.
- It's okay. No sleep in this room either.

228
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:14,208
Can you believe they charge
$5 for a Snickers?

229
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:18,038
I could bankrupt the airline
in about four bites.

230
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:21,917
Just thought
maybe you would want to...

231
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,620
Talk? Absolutely.

233
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:29,416
Let's get some air.
- Great.

235
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,230
All right. 
Be down there in 5 minutes.

236
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:42,199
You enjoying the shakes?
The nightmares, rapid heartbeat.

238
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:43,363
A little bit.

239
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:47,533
Union's offering us counseling.
- Yeah. What are they gonna say?

241
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,743
"You were in a plane crash and lived."

242
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:52,280
"It may have a minor impact
on your day-to-day."

243
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:55,720
I don't like not being
in control of the process.

244
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,877
I want my self back.

245
00:12:58,378 --> 00:13:00,415
I'm hoping 6 months from now,
we'll just be laughing,

246
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,719
about how we got to meet David Letterman.

247
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:07,129
We're doing David Letterman?

248
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,392
Yeah, right after 
the next NTSB interview.

250
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,302
I'm guessing Dave
is gonna be slightly funnier.

251
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,764
This is so surreal.
I guess I'm having a little trouble

253
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:19,739
separating reality
from whatever the hell <i>this</i> is.

255
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:23,407
<i>This</i> is two men 
freezing their asses off.

257
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:30,588
Don't worry. 
You did a great thing.

258
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:32,916
It's gonna be remembered
for a very long time.

259
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:34,786
Here's the funny thing:

260
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:38,258
I've delivered a million passengers
over 40 years in the air,

261
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:43,089
but in the end, I'm gonna be 
judged on 208 seconds.

262
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:48,205
Come on.
Tomorrow's gonna be a good day.

263
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:52,174
Computer simulations will prove you were right. 
We can all put our wings back on.

264
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:55,107
Wanna run?
- Let's run.

267
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:00,641
Fucking cold out here.

268
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:04,319
It was obvious.
It was a critical situation,

270
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:08,949
losing thrust in both engines
at a low altitude

271
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:13,287
over one of the most densely
populated areas of the planet.

272
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:18,633
But choosing to land on the Hudson,
that was still a big "if."

273
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,368
I was sure I could do it.

274
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:24,535
You were?
- Yes.

276
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:28,202
How do you feel
when people call you a hero?

277
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:31,478
I don't feel 
like a hero.

278
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:34,982
I'm just a man 
who was doing his job.

279
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:37,879
The right man for the job
at the right time.

280
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:42,824
You've been flying for what,
nearly 40 years?

281
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:46,022
Forty-two. 
It's been my life.

282
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:48,761
My whole life.

284
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:02,536
Your aircraft.
- My aircraft.

286
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:18,517
I'll be busy crop dusting
in the Super Cub rest of the summer.

287
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:21,358
You can take the plane up,
when you please.

288
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:23,592
Still 6 bucks an hour.
I'll consider it lesson time.

289
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,260
A pilot never stops 
acquiring knowledge.

290
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,366
You'll make mistakes, everyone does.
Just learn from them.

291
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,873
Yes, sir.

292
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:34,868
And never forget,
no matter what's happening:

293
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:37,806
Fly the airplane.
- Absolutely, sir.

295
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:42,282
One other thing,
this is important.

296
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,786
- Sir?
- Go ahead and smile.

298
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,417
All right.

299
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:59,625
- I apologize for the perspiration.
- After what you did,

301
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:01,735
I'd think that Katie
couldn't be too intimidating.

302
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:06,243
It wasn't Katie but the lights 
and the camera she brought with her.

304
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:13,742
All done. That was from my mom.
Her name is Brenda,

307
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:16,648
she says to say "thank you".
And that she's single.

308
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:20,250
You tell Brenda, thank you,
but I've got a girl at home.

309
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:23,451
- Lucky woman. 
- Thank you.

311
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:09,204
Sully? Where are you? 
I'm standing here calling your name.

315
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:17,041
Whats up with you?
You need to get focused.

317
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:20,311
Because the media 
request avalanche continues.

319
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:25,154
Larry Rooney volunteered to jump in,

320
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:27,348
and ride shotgun with you
the rest of the way.

321
00:17:28,014 --> 00:17:29,652
Thought you might need a friend.

322
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:31,988
He'll take you to 
today's NTSB meeting.

323
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:35,325
Airbus completed their
computer simulations as well.

324
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:37,399
Good, that'll help.

325
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:42,662
There's something else. 
Arnie Gentile called, He has the ACARS data.

327
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:45,172
The left engine
was still operating at idle.

328
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:48,342
Not possible. 
I felt it go.

329
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:50,242
It was like 
we were stopped in midair.

330
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:54,881
Arnie said there was a chance it was sub-idle,
that it still could've had thrust.

332
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:58,849
I'm just letting you know,
since the NTSB already does.

335
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:13,769
Is retirement next?
What's next for you?

339
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:24,311
Larry. Good to see a friendly face.
- Might be the last one you see today.

341
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:29,476
You've got to be kidding me.
We've been through all this before.

342
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:30,950
I'm sorry if you're frustrated,

343
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,148
but our job is to investigate 
how a plane ended up in the Hudson River.

344
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:35,986
<i>On</i> the Hudson River.

345
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:42,825
Isn't it a little early in the year
to go fishing?

346
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:45,492
Seeking the facts
is hardly "fishing," Mr. Skiles.

347
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:47,137
Okay, then here is 
the most important fact:

348
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,603
There's only two people who know
what happened in the cockpit that day.

349
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:50,796
And I'm one of them.

350
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,169
We appreciate your perspective.

351
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,301
Why do you even think 
we are here today?

352
00:18:56,435 --> 00:19:00,008
It's because Captain Sullenberger
did not head back to LaGuardia.

353
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:04,748
I just finished training 
on the A320 and I can tell you,

354
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,753
the only reason the plane operated
as well as it did,

355
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:08,448
that the aircraft could land anywhere,

356
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:11,251
is because Captain Sullenberger
turned on the Auxiliary Power Unit.

357
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:13,522
He was simply following the QRH.

358
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:17,130
No, he wasn't. He wasn't following
proper procedure at all.

360
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:19,496
I know, because I had 
the QRH in my hands.

361
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:22,606
He switched on the APU immediately
after engine rollback.

362
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:26,535
According to Airbus,
that's the 15th thing on the list to do.

363
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:28,042
Fifteenth.

364
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,871
If he had followed the damn rules,
we'd all be dead.

365
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,814
Maybe that's the part 
you don't like.

366
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:37,011
You're not used to having
answers to your guesses.

367
00:19:38,144 --> 00:19:44,154
Look, Jeff's saying that I know the A320.
What it does and what it doesn't do.

369
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:48,059
I have read countless CUR transcripts
of deceased pilots

370
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,826
and I have significant
accident investigation experience.

371
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:57,668
There's no question that you're a
talented, dedicated, experienced pro.

373
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,367
But all the flights you piloted
before January 15th

374
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:03,878
and every crash you investigated
are not the purview of this investigation.

375
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,041
Only US Airways 1549 matters today.

376
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:09,577
Your union has been advised.

377
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:15,356
ACARS data relayed that the left engine
continued to turn throughout the flight.

379
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,084
Then the ACARS data is <i>wrong.</i>

380
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:18,922
The evidence shows that the left engine

381
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:22,362
was at idle or sub-idle
immediately following the bird strike.

382
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:25,900
You show me the left engine,
I'll show you dead birds and no power.

383
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:30,268
The left engine was lost in the crash
due to excessive damage on touchdown.

384
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:32,670
But we can circle back to that later.

385
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:35,711
Let's just assume that it was,
as you say,

386
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:38,371
a dual engine loss
due to bird strike.

387
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:44,680
Your weight was 151,510 pounds,
wind and temperature north-northwest, 21°.

389
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:48,087
Speed and altitude
200 knots at 2,818 feet.

390
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:50,292
- Agree?
- Correct.

391
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:52,520
We were able to run
all the algorithms concurrently.

392
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:57,134
The resulting computer simulations
of US Airways Flight 1549

393
00:20:57,289 --> 00:21:00,099
show that the aviation engineers
were correct.

394
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:03,434
There was enough altitude and speed
after the bird strike

395
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,974
for a successful return to LaGuardia.

396
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:07,901
Successful?

397
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:10,411
The plane landed at LaGuardia.

398
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,944
Intact. Undamaged.

400
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,143
You got that 
from <i>one</i> computer simulation?

401
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,711
No. From 20.

403
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:25,658
Including attempts made for Teterboro 
runways 1-9 and LaGuardia runways 2-2 and 1-3.

405
00:21:25,818 --> 00:21:29,561
Every computer simulation
with the exact flight parameters

406
00:21:29,722 --> 00:21:33,135
demonstrated that a return
to LaGuardia was possible.

407
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,896
And not just possible, probable.

408
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:42,068
Does anyone need to hear
further computer evidence?

409
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:48,813
Captain Sullenberger?
First Officer Skiles?

411
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,779
Not at this time.

412
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:55,784
I would like to go over
the parameters that we used.

413
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:58,423
We will make them 
available to the union.

414
00:21:58,584 --> 00:21:59,585
Thank you.

415
00:21:59,752 --> 00:22:01,527
Once the investigation is complete,

416
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:04,463
we'll be able lo share
the actual computer simulations.

417
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:06,466
For now, they remain confidential.

418
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,502
We cannot afford a leak to the press.

419
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:12,442
There's been far too much talk
in the press already.

421
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:19,615
When the complete cockpit
voice recording is compiled,

422
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:22,981
along with ATC
and all on board transcripts combined,

423
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:25,144
we will call you back.

424
00:22:26,612 --> 00:22:32,122
Gentlemen. Good day.
- Thank you.

426
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:40,731
They're playing Pacman.

427
00:22:40,893 --> 00:22:43,499
You were flying a plane
full of human beings.

428
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:47,641
Somehow, that's not 
how I remember it.

429
00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:51,737
It just doesn't seem right.
- It's because it's not right.

431
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:54,475
You did everything you could
and it was more than enough.

432
00:22:55,241 --> 00:22:59,186
Ask the passengers.
Ask your wife and kids, ask mine.

436
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:26,576
What was the first thing
you heard from the cockpit?

437
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:28,719
"Brace for impact." 
Yes.

438
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:31,610
No. Ever hear that before
coming out of a cockpit?

439
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:33,222
- No, not ever.

441
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:39,358
Ever hear that in any other
aspect of your lives?

443
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:46,260
I don't know.

445
00:23:50,129 --> 00:23:52,735
They could take 
this show away from me.

446
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:56,571
Jeff was relaxed and funny.

447
00:23:57,136 --> 00:23:58,774
He should be getting
all of our interview requests.

448
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:02,141
Are they paying you for 
all this media stuff at least?

450
00:24:02,308 --> 00:24:05,613
It's news.
No payment is necessary.

452
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:09,157
I wish the bank felt the same way.
- Why, what do you mean?

455
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,323
We got another notice
about the space in Butte County.

456
00:24:18,257 --> 00:24:20,830
We'll find a tenant.
It just takes time.

458
00:24:20,993 --> 00:24:22,631
You've been saying that
for nine months.

459
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:25,736
It's still vacant.
- The economy has to take a turn.

461
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:30,976
It just feels like if we lose that space,
the next domino to fall is the house.

462
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:34,015
We're not gonna lose the house.

463
00:24:34,173 --> 00:24:41,924
I'm sorry. I'm just anxious
and I'm alone and not enough sleep.

467
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:45,622
I know, not a lot of sleep 
going on here either.

469
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:47,627
I'm sorry if I'm 
adding to your stress.

470
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:50,164
Just tell me you'll be 
back in the air soon.

471
00:24:50,756 --> 00:24:53,669
Wel, not until the NTSB
is finished with their investigation.

472
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:58,942
We need you flying.
- If this goes badly,

474
00:24:59,098 --> 00:25:04,104
my career as a safety expert will end 
as a website and a business card.

475
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:06,510
I'm more worried
about your career as a pilot.

476
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:14,650
What if I did blow this?
- What are you saying?

478
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:19,155
What if I did get this wrong,
so close to the end of my career?

479
00:25:19,952 --> 00:25:23,195
If I endangered the lives
of all those passengers?

480
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:28,365
Watch the news. 
You're a hero.

481
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,133
Everyone's gonna have to get used to it,
including the NTSB.

482
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:37,174
Worst case scenario, the NTSB 
lists me as the probable cause.

484
00:25:37,336 --> 00:25:39,976
That's immediate retirement. 
No pension.

485
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:41,674
My life's work gone.

486
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,980
You're scaring me now.
What is going on?

487
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:49,022
The left engine might have
still been idling.

488
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:55,032
And the Airbus simulations say
I could've made it back to LaGuardia safely.

490
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,192
But that doesn't make sense.

491
00:25:57,689 --> 00:26:01,660
Doesn't accord with everything
I felt in the cockpit.

492
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:07,506
Then why did you do it?
Land in the water?

494
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,912
Wasn't that the most 
dangerous thing you could've done?

495
00:26:18,177 --> 00:26:20,680
Good afternoon, Gursimran.

496
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,919
The tuna basil 
or the ham and cheddar?

497
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:27,564
Tuna basil. Very fresh.

498
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,101
- Thank you.
- Be careful up there.

499
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,238
Too cold today. 
Too much cold.

500
00:26:35,394 --> 00:26:40,877
When are you gonna come fly with me?
When US Air starts flights to Hyderabad.

502
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,545
I will talk to the chairman,
see what we can work out.


504
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:50,447
For heaven's sakes, Diane.

505
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:50,447
- It's his birthday.
- No, Mom.

506
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,054
Just a little something.

507
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:54,418
The suitcase is already overstuffed
with gifts for Will.

508
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,491
It's always fun to get
something from the airport.

509
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:58,557
Feels like you've traveled, too.

510
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:00,458
Ma, he's turning 1.

511
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:03,395
Don't think he'll be discerning
what gift came from where.

512
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:06,967
But I will.
Maybe a snow globe?

514
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:09,629
Something he'll remember.
Something "New York."

515
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:12,071
Were you this generous 
when we were kids?

516
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:15,909
Okay, sweetheart.
I'll get you a snow globe.

519
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,077
Fine. Come on.

520
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:32,625
- Good afternoon, Sheila.
- Captain.

521
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,263
- Hello, Donna.
- Captain.

522
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:38,367
- Jeff.
- Hey. How are ya?

523
00:27:43,195 --> 00:27:44,435
Hey guys. Jeff.

524
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:45,768
We're not gonna make it.

525
00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:47,103
I've been waiting for a year
for this trip, Dad.

526
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:49,473
I'm not gonna miss this flight.
Just meet us at the gate, okay?

528
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:55,979
Altimeter is verified. 3-0-2-3.

529
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:58,280
3-0-2-3.

530
00:28:01,547 --> 00:28:03,458
Start checklist complete.

531
00:28:06,952 --> 00:28:08,898
You really think they'll release us?

532
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:10,793
I've checked the latest reports.

533
00:28:10,956 --> 00:28:12,401
We're clear all the way to Charlotte.

534
00:28:14,126 --> 00:28:17,167
Ten steaks.
Del Frisco's. On me.

536
00:28:17,496 --> 00:28:20,303
Never been.
And I hear good things.

539
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:24,238
The rib eye will break your heart.

540
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:29,915
I'm more of a porterhouse man.
- The porterhouse will stop your heart.

542
00:28:30,576 --> 00:28:33,822
We're now closed for US Airways 
flight 1549 service to Charlotte...

544
00:28:33,979 --> 00:28:36,421
- Wait.
- You got it.

546
00:28:36,982 --> 00:28:39,993
- Sorry.
- Spirit sent us.

548
00:28:40,152 --> 00:28:41,995
We got canceled and they said
that we were re-routed.

549
00:28:42,154 --> 00:28:43,428
That you guys had some seats?

550
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:44,659
Flight is closed.

551
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:47,326
See that old guy
limping up right there?

552
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:49,665
That's my dad. It's an emergency.
He's gotta be on this flight.

553
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:51,501
What kind of emergency?

554
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:54,269
- Golf emergency?
- This flight canceled?

555
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:55,844
Oughta be.

556
00:28:56,702 --> 00:28:58,340
- ID's please.
- Oh my God.

557
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:00,775
How many people are traveling?
- Three. Thank you.

559
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:02,509
Nothing together.

560
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:04,347
That's all right.
Hell, I'll fly on the wing.

561
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,849
Here we go.

562
00:29:07,012 --> 00:29:11,121
22A, 6A and 6C.

565
00:29:11,283 --> 00:29:13,852
Thank you so much.

567
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:16,124
- Guess what?
- Happy ending.

568
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:19,024
- She gave me the eye.
- You charming bastard.

569
00:29:19,191 --> 00:29:21,526
Welcome aboard. How's it going?
- Lucky you made it.

571
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:22,967
- Yeah, no kidding.

573
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:26,704
- We're in 6, Jeff.
- No. That's all Jimmy.

574
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:28,538
I was up till 3:00.
I gotta get some sleep.

575
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,940
You can sleep here.

576
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:31,877
Not with you verbally running
the course the whole time.

577
00:29:32,037 --> 00:29:33,778
"I think I'll play
the seven iron on the 9th."

578
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:35,282
- No. Good night.

579
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:39,749
Sorry. Excuse me.

580
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:44,719
Here you go.

581
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:46,556
- Thanks.
- Of course.

583
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:50,566
I'm in here.

584
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:51,792
I'm so sorry.

585
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:53,231
He likes to throw everything.

586
00:29:53,392 --> 00:29:55,394
That's perfect.
I like to catch everything.

587
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:57,638
Hey, little man.

588
00:29:58,096 --> 00:29:59,575
I googled you last night.

589
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:03,306
Read all about your company
on your website.

590
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:07,439
It's impressive.
- Thanks.

593
00:30:09,241 --> 00:30:12,347
I thought I was
a good bullshitter, but you?

594
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:16,918
You could go pro.
I'm only teasing.

597
00:30:17,082 --> 00:30:18,152
The site does make it sound

598
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:20,923
like your air safety consulting business
has got about 100 employees

599
00:30:21,086 --> 00:30:24,124
and headquarters in three states.

600
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:28,270
Then when I dug a little deeper,
I realized it's only you.

602
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:32,609
Go easy.
I'm just getting it going.

604
00:30:33,265 --> 00:30:34,972
I'm not usually accused
of being a bullshitter.

605
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:37,769
Don't get me wrong.
Actually, it's a compliment.

606
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:40,780
Off that website? 
I'd hire you.

607
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:42,941
<i>Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

608
00:30:43,108 --> 00:30:45,315
<i>Welcome on board 
US Airways Flight 1549</i>

609
00:30:45,477 --> 00:30:46,854
<i>with service to Charlotte.</i>

610
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:50,118
<i>Please review the safety instruction card
in the seatback pocket in front of you.</i>

611
00:30:50,282 --> 00:30:52,626
<i>It explains the safety features
of this aircraft</i>

612
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:56,027
<i>as well as the location and operation
of the exit and flotation devices.</i>

613
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:58,794
<i>Your seat cushion serves
as a flotation device.</i>

614
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:02,200
LaGuardia ramp, Cactus 1549.
Ready for pushback at gate 21.

615
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:04,363
Cactus 1549, 
gate 21 cleared to push.

616
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,872
Spot 28, ground for taxi.

618
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:15,147
Be sure you turn that off.

619
00:31:16,475 --> 00:31:17,818
Tray table up.

620
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:38,171
Just once I'd like to
get out of LaGuardia on time.

621
00:31:38,697 --> 00:31:41,177
You know the only way to
get out of LaGuardia on time.

622
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:42,539
Yeah, what's that?

623
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:46,004
Fly out of JFK.
- Funny.

625
00:31:55,547 --> 00:31:57,527
Takeoff minimum fuel quantity verify.

626
00:31:57,682 --> 00:31:58,683
19,000 pounds required.

627
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,193
We got 21.8 on board.

628
00:32:00,352 --> 00:32:03,060
19,000 pounds required. 
21.8 on board.

629
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:06,259
Cactus 1549. Runway 4. 
Cleared for takeoff.

630
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,030
Cactus 1549. 
Cleared for takeoff.

632
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:16,878
TO/GA.

633
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:18,378
TO/GA set.

634
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,164
Positive rate.

635
00:32:43,762 --> 00:32:47,666
Gear up, please.

638
00:32:58,243 --> 00:32:59,916
Nice view of the Hudson.

639
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:03,455
I'll never get over
how beautiful it is up here.

640
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:06,159
Life's easier in the air.

641
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:07,991
I guess it is.

642
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:11,456
Birds.

645
00:33:20,265 --> 00:33:21,938
Shit.

646
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:23,468
Yeah.

648
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,514
Just turbulence, probably.

649
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:32,984
I'll check the cabin.

650
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:34,650
What do you think is going on?

651
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:37,782
It's okay.

652
00:33:38,283 --> 00:33:41,628
Everyone, might be a good idea
just to keep your seat belts on.

653
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:45,863
We got one rolling back.

654
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:50,469
We have both of them rolling back.

655
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,038
Ignition start.

658
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:04,683
Oh my God.

659
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:07,487
I'm starting the APU.

660
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:13,323
Just double-check your seat belts, please.

661
00:34:13,485 --> 00:34:14,486
Seat belt. Relax.

662
00:34:14,653 --> 00:34:15,996
Can I make sure
your seatbelts are fastened?

663
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:17,656
Make sure
your seat belts are fastened.

664
00:34:20,025 --> 00:34:21,402
Seat belts.

665
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:28,074
What do you think that was?
- I think it was a bird strike.

666
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,839
Then we're going back to LaGuardia?
- Yeah.

667
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:32,771
Get out the QRH.

668
00:34:33,038 --> 00:34:35,075
Loss of thrust on both engines.

669
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,679
Mayday, mayday, mayday.
This is Cactus 1549.

670
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:38,843
We hit birds.

671
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,853
Maintain 1-5000, Delta 3-3-1.

672
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:44,425
We've lost thrust on both engines.
We are turning back towards LaGuardia.

673
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:46,392
You need to return to LaGuardia?

674
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:48,888
- Turn left heading 2-2-0.
- 2-2-0.

675
00:34:49,054 --> 00:34:50,533
Which engine did you lose?

676
00:34:50,689 --> 00:34:51,861
Both. Both engines.

677
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:53,024
- Supe?
- Yeah?

678
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:54,636
I have an emergency.

679
00:34:56,895 --> 00:34:57,896
What's the report?

680
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,131
Both engines.

681
00:34:59,364 --> 00:35:01,537
- What?
- <i>Both</i> engines gone. No thrust.

682
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:07,539
All right.
LaGuardia says go to runway 1-3.

684
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:10,318
Tower, stop your departure.
Got an emergency returning.

685
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:12,113
1549, bird strike.

686
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:14,086
He lost both engines.
Returning immediately.

687
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:15,246
Which engine?

688
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:17,757
He lost thrust in both engines, he said.

689
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:21,787
Cactus 1549, if we can get it for you,
do you wanna try to land runway 1-3?

690
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:25,628
We are unable.
We may end up in the Hudson.

692
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:29,766
I got an A320 diving for the river.

693
00:35:29,928 --> 00:35:31,601
Al, stack all the inbounds to LaGuardia.

694
00:35:31,763 --> 00:35:33,401
Let's put a hold on the tower, please.

695
00:35:33,565 --> 00:35:34,771
Come on, guys, stay on point.

696
00:35:34,933 --> 00:35:35,968
<i>What about over to our right?</i>

697
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,410
Anything in New Jersey? Maybe Teterboro?

698
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:39,571
Teterboro tower, I need a runway.

699
00:35:39,738 --> 00:35:41,342
Cactus 1549 needs to go
to the airport right now.

700
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:42,917
Newark tower, what have you got?

701
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:44,678
You have runway 2-9 cleared and ready.

702
00:35:44,843 --> 00:35:46,254
You need emergency landing?
- Yes.

703
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:47,412
Okay, yeah.

704
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:49,592
Off your right side is Teterboro airport.

706
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:54,858
Shit.

707
00:35:55,687 --> 00:35:59,125
This is the Captain.
Brace for impact.

709
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,696
- Oh my God.
- What?

711
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:06,298
Brace, brace, brace.
Heads down, stay down.

715
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,650
Cactus 1549, turn right 2-8-0.

716
00:36:13,805 --> 00:36:15,478
You can land runway one Teterboro.

717
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,477
We can't make it.
We're gonna end up in the Hudson.

719
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:20,623
I'm sorry. Say again, Cactus?

720
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,996
Cactus 1549, radar contact lost.

721
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:29,897
KC, come on over here.

722
00:36:30,055 --> 00:36:33,127
You also got Newark off your two o'clock
in about seven miles.

723
00:36:34,826 --> 00:36:36,362
Don't go in the river.

724
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:38,132
- Sir?
- Plug in.

725
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,202
Cactus 1549, if you can,

726
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:45,814
you got runway 2-9 available at Newark.

727
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,813
It'll be two o'clock in seven miles.

728
00:36:48,473 --> 00:36:51,652
Come on.
Please, God.

730
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,886
I'm sorry, Patrick.

731
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,324
He's inbound to Newark, I know it.
He just went off the box to focus.

732
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:00,518
Patty...

733
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:03,927
He'll come back up.
He's heading to Teterboro.

735
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:06,035
We need other eyes and ears.

736
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:09,061
Attention, all aircraft
in the vicinity of the GW.

737
00:37:11,096 --> 00:37:14,873
When we come up around this bend
we'll see the USS Intrepid.

739
00:37:15,033 --> 00:37:16,944
PWe got an A320 
on emergency descent.

740
00:37:17,102 --> 00:37:20,743
Cactus 1549 is 
low level above the Hudson.

741
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:24,546
This is helicopter 1-6-7, Mike Tango.
I've got eyes on him.

742
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:26,211
Okay. I got a chopper with visuals.

743
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:29,948
I'm staying on this.
He's out there.

745
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:34,763
He's headed to Newark, seven miles.
It's only seven miles.

746
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:41,068
Cactus 1549, this is departure control.
On guard, do you read?

747
00:37:41,793 --> 00:37:43,466
He's going down.

748
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:46,273
Cactus 1549, do you read me?

749
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:50,311
Shit. He's going down.
He's gonna hit the water.

750
00:37:51,703 --> 00:37:54,081
- KC, take his seat.
- Sure.

751
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:00,916
Tester's gonna come down.

752
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:04,250
Breathalyzer, urine samples,
it's standard.

753
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:06,729
His voice was so calm.

754
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:10,232
When he said the Hudson,
I didn't believe it.

755
00:38:11,556 --> 00:38:13,467
This isn't happening.

756
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:16,928
People don't survive
water landings, Henry.

759
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,244
We're gonna brace.

765
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:39,751
I'd better go.

766
00:38:41,286 --> 00:38:44,028
I'm so sorry. 
I love you.

767
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:47,328
I gotta go.

769
00:38:58,102 --> 00:39:00,673
<i>It had just taken off
from New York's LaGuardia Airport,</i>

770
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:04,950
<i>bound for Charlotte, North Carolina,
and then mid-air a disaster</i>

772
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:08,283
<i>struck US Airways Flight 1549.</i>

773
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:12,223
<i>It's possible that birds flew into
both of the aircraft engines.</i>

774
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:16,126
<i>The pilot quickly realized he could not
return to the airport and land.</i>

775
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:18,130
<i>His options severely limited,</i>

776
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:21,236
<i>the only place he could go down
was the Hudson River.</i>

777
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:37,144
<i>Choosing to land on the Hudson, 
that was a big "if"</i>

778
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:39,254
<i>Have you had
any troubles at home lately?</i>

779
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:41,913
<i>Why did you do it?
Land in the water?</i>

780
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,356
<i>You did everything you could. 
It was more than enough.</i>

781
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:48,088
<i>Every computer simulation
demonstrated that a return was possible.</i>

782
00:39:48,253 --> 00:39:50,233
<i>The left engine
was still operating at idle.</i>

783
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:53,926
<i>There was enough altitude and speed
for a successful return to LaGuardia.</i>

784
00:39:54,092 --> 00:39:56,231
<i>Wasn't that the most
dangerous thing you could have done?</i>

786
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,523
<i>This is Tasty 1-1.
<i>Abort test bombing run.</i>

787
00:40:22,687 --> 00:40:24,291
<i>I have an emergency
flight control malfunction.</i>

788
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:25,798
<i>Two, join on me.</i>

789
00:40:25,957 --> 00:40:28,028
<i>Roger that.
Two joining on you.</i>

790
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:31,536
<i>- Feels like hydraulics.</i>
<i>- Sir, do we need to punch out?</i>

791
00:40:31,696 --> 00:40:34,233
<i>No, I can still fly.
I'm running a control test.</i>

792
00:40:34,866 --> 00:40:36,140
<i>Get the checklist.</i>

793
00:40:36,301 --> 00:40:37,541
<i>We have the checklist.</i>

794
00:40:37,702 --> 00:40:39,272
<i>Increasing thrust.
We need altitude.</i>

795
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:40,745
<i>Hold on, we're gonna climb.</i>

796
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:46,050
<i>Nellis Tower, this is Tasty 14</i>

797
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,587
<i>with an emergency
flight control malfunction.</i>

798
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:48,815
<i>We need a straight-in approach.</i>

799
00:40:49,881 --> 00:40:50,951
Roger, Tasty 1-1.

800
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,493
<i>Turn left 2-0-0 to runway 3.</i>

801
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:55,824
<i>Unable. I repeat, 
I need a straight-in approach.</i>

802
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,121
<i>Okay.</i>

803
00:40:57,388 --> 00:40:58,833
<i>Proceed straight ahead to runway 24.</i>

804
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:00,560
<i>24, Tasty 1-1.</i>

805
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:05,135
<i>Two, I'm decreasing speed.</i>

806
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,139
<i>Clear the board for a damage check.</i>

807
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:17,013
<i>One, you look clean and dry,
but you're still trailing smoke.</i>

808
00:41:17,175 --> 00:41:19,416
<i>Roger that, Two.
Approach runway 2-1.</i>

809
00:41:19,944 --> 00:41:22,254
<i>One, I'll maintain chase
and follow you in.</i>

810
00:41:30,755 --> 00:41:31,756
<i>I have visual on the runway.</i>

811
00:41:31,923 --> 00:41:33,095
<i>What's our heading?</i>

812
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:35,601
<i>Heading 0-2-0.
Five miles out.</i>

813
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,830
<i>All right. Gear in. </i>

814
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,207
Tasty 1-1, check air speed.

815
00:41:44,369 --> 00:41:46,212
<i>Looks like you're coming in hat.</i>

816
00:41:46,371 --> 00:41:48,180
<i>Nellis Tower,
I need speed to maintain control.</i>

817
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,285
<i>Avoiding a stall.</i>

818
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:55,890
<i>One, check your heading.
You're not gonna make the runway.</i>

819
00:41:56,047 --> 00:41:57,117
<i>I got it.</i>

820
00:41:57,782 --> 00:41:59,284
<i>I'm bringing her back.</i>

821
00:42:16,968 --> 00:42:19,244
<i>That was a hell of a landing.</i>

822
00:42:19,404 --> 00:42:21,543
<i>I didn't think we were gonna make it.</i>

824
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:52,444
<i>I'm gonna start charging you
for this stuff, all right?</i>

825
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:54,276
<i>get out of here.
- You hear me?</i>

826
00:42:54,605 --> 00:42:55,845
Thanks.

827
00:42:56,007 --> 00:42:57,008
You got any nuts?

828
00:42:57,708 --> 00:43:01,190
Hey. Let me know 
if you need anything.

830
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:06,388
<i>It still seems so hard to believe,
that everyone aboard the plane survived,</i>

832
00:43:06,551 --> 00:43:09,555
<i>including two shivering babies
who were found in a life raft...</i>

834
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:13,897
Is that you?

835
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:18,268
- Are you the pilot, Sully? That's you right?
- Yeah.

837
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:20,540
Pleasure to meet you.

838
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:23,912
That was unreal,
what you did the other day.

839
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:26,378
- That was really something.
- He's a hero.

840
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:28,574
Real pleasure to meet you.

841
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:30,241
We invented a drink after you

842
00:43:30,408 --> 00:43:31,978
as soon as that happened.
Ain't that right, Johnny?

843
00:43:32,143 --> 00:43:33,952
Yeah, you did.
In fact, I'll take one.

844
00:43:34,479 --> 00:43:36,254
The Sully.

845
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:42,287
A shot of Grey Goose
with a splash of water.

847
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,228
Splash of water.

848
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:48,801
Hey, listen.

849
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,967
To January 15th.
Best day of the year.

851
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:54,398
To Sully.

852
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:00,738
Hey, Pete.

853
00:44:00,905 --> 00:44:05,617
Sully's here, and he's there.
Damn, Pete. He's everywhere.

857
00:44:10,915 --> 00:44:13,088
You're like real hero,
you know that?

859
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,265
Keep it coming, Paulie.
I'll see you on One.

861
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:32,674
Twenty-one people on board, Cap.

862
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:34,544
Last report says
there's ice out by the GW.

863
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:36,776
- All right, thanks. Roger that.
- All right.

864
00:44:36,941 --> 00:44:39,353
Twenty-one on the TJ,
departing Midtown, slip Seven.

866
00:44:53,491 --> 00:44:54,993
I cannot believe
you have the sack to say that.

867
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:57,036
That's literally like giving
the entire city the finger.

868
00:44:57,195 --> 00:44:58,196
I'll say it again.

869
00:44:58,396 --> 00:44:59,466
Dennis Eckersley is without question

870
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:01,735
the greatest relief pitcher
in the history of baseball.

871
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:03,310
Are you blinded by the leg kick?

872
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:05,504
Is that what it is? 
Or is it the mustache?

873
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:07,377
You're just jealous 
he was never a Yankee.

874
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:10,144
-Jealous?
-Yeah.

879
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:48,421
Brace, brace, brace...

880
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:49,580
Heads down, stay down...

881
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,249
Let me hold him.

882
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:52,689
- Brace.
- It's okay. Let me hold him.

884
00:45:54,185 --> 00:45:56,062
Heads down, stay down.

887
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,695
- We're not gonna make it.
- It's okay.

889
00:46:03,027 --> 00:46:04,370
I love you, Mom.

890
00:46:04,528 --> 00:46:08,873
To the moon and the stars...
and all the way back.

894
00:46:37,094 --> 00:46:38,471
What do we do, darling?

897
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:54,316
Oh my God.

898
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:03,189
Evacuate.

901
00:47:04,422 --> 00:47:05,799
Grab your life vests, please.

902
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:07,594
<i>Opening forward door.</i>

904
00:47:16,434 --> 00:47:17,845
It's flooding back here.

905
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:19,481
Rob Kolodjay.

907
00:47:23,607 --> 00:47:29,022
Everyone. The aft exits are unusable.
Move forward to the ovenuing exits.

909
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:31,456
Don life vests now.


911
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,532
Exit. Go.

912
00:47:45,162 --> 00:47:47,365
Move forward to the right
or left exit door.

914
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:48,532
Jeff.

915
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:49,871
He's back there, can you see him?

916
00:47:50,301 --> 00:47:51,644
Dad.

917
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,323
- Everyone, come forward.
- Jump.

918
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:07,491
Sir, evacuate the plane right now. Go.

920
00:48:12,523 --> 00:48:14,002
<i>Sheila, the raft didn't deploy.</i>

921
00:48:18,996 --> 00:48:20,498
<i>Come back, sir.</i>

922
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,006
Calm down. You'll be fine.

923
00:48:23,167 --> 00:48:24,510
<i>The rafts are waking.</i>

925
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:32,081
<i>Come on.</i>
<i>Hurry up.</i>

927
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:33,847
It's gonna be bitter out there.
Here you go.

928
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:36,753
Here. Gonna be bitter out there.

929
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:39,950
Slowly.

930
00:48:40,184 --> 00:48:41,424
<i>You need to get off this plane now.</i>

931
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:43,223
<i>Feel first. 
Slide slowly and gently.</i>

932
00:48:43,387 --> 00:48:45,060
<i>- Plenty of room.</i>
- <i>Come on, people.</i>

933
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:52,733
Okay. It's good now. Jump.

935
00:49:08,546 --> 00:49:10,253
Is that gas?

936
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:12,553
We have to jump.

937
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,224
No, wait.

939
00:49:24,895 --> 00:49:26,067
You seeing this?

940
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:28,437
Holy Christ, that's a plane.

941
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:30,943
Deploy that
man overboard ladder right away.

942
00:49:31,101 --> 00:49:32,273
All right, I'm on it.

943
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:33,574
Shit.

944
00:49:34,405 --> 00:49:35,645
Mayday, mayday, mayday-

945
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:38,412
Coast Guard sector New York,
channel 1-6, Thomas Jefferson.

946
00:49:38,576 --> 00:49:41,648
<i>We have a passenger airliner
in the north river.</i>

947
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:44,122
<i>We're on route. 
We will advise.</i>

948
00:49:44,582 --> 00:49:46,994
Let's go.

949
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:04,841
Jimmy, Jeffs still on that plane.

950
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:06,670
We can't leave him there.

951
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,441
Robbie.

952
00:50:08,606 --> 00:50:12,283
- The crew will grab him, okay?
- He's in there.

954
00:50:12,443 --> 00:50:15,014
He'll be okay.

955
00:50:15,346 --> 00:50:18,122
I'm okay, Mom.

957
00:50:21,452 --> 00:50:22,795
- Ma.
- Just leave me.

958
00:50:22,953 --> 00:50:24,796
Keep moving forward.

959
00:50:24,955 --> 00:50:26,628
Follow your instructions.

960
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:28,633
- It's all right.
- There's water in the back.

961
00:50:28,792 --> 00:50:30,169
- We're doing fine.
- Come on. Let's get out.

962
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:32,637
One after another. Keep moving forward.

963
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:34,298
This way. I'll help you out.

964
00:50:34,465 --> 00:50:35,569
You go ahead, sweetheart.

965
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:36,800
Come on. She can't move.

966
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:38,071
- Sir. Can you come help us?
- Yes, ma'am?

967
00:50:38,235 --> 00:50:39,236
Right there.

968
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:41,815
Here's a floatation device.
Take that.

969
00:50:42,673 --> 00:50:44,812
<i>Everyone, keep moving forward.</i>

970
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:46,750
<i>Over the wings.</i>

971
00:50:48,078 --> 00:50:50,422
<i>If you have a life vest, put it on.</i>

972
00:50:50,848 --> 00:50:53,089
<i>All series near the Intrepid,
plane down.</i>

973
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:56,356
<i>We got passengers on the wings.
Approach with caution.</i>

974
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:02,932
<i>Stay calm and you'll all get out.</i>

975
00:51:04,428 --> 00:51:05,429
<i>Thank you.</i>

976
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,210
<i>Move forward.</i>

977
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:18,947
Come on.

980
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:27,920
Put a blanket on her leg.

981
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:29,687
She needs a tourniquet.

982
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:31,799
You're gonna be fine, honey. Go slow.

983
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:33,564
Go slowly. Blanket.

984
00:51:34,391 --> 00:51:36,803
Wrap this around her leg. Make it tight.

985
00:51:38,562 --> 00:51:40,564
It's so cold out here.

986
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:45,380
<i>Get those first-aid kits
up to the bow</i>

987
00:51:45,536 --> 00:51:47,277
<i>and get some 
extra life jackets out there.</i>

988
00:51:47,571 --> 00:51:49,448
We're here.

990
00:51:52,476 --> 00:51:54,285
It's all right. We're here.

991
00:51:59,883 --> 00:52:01,157
<i>Give me a countdown, Victor.</i>

992
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:02,729
All right.

993
00:52:04,154 --> 00:52:05,155
<i>Three</i>

994
00:52:05,823 --> 00:52:07,063
two...

995
00:52:08,392 --> 00:52:10,065
We're good.

996
00:52:11,629 --> 00:52:13,131
Come on, buddy.

997
00:52:15,265 --> 00:52:17,506
Hold it right there, baby.

998
00:52:17,668 --> 00:52:18,908
Easy. Go easy.

999
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:23,619
Come on. One at a time.

1000
00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:27,418
<i>We're gonna get everybody, guys.</i>

1004
00:52:59,777 --> 00:53:02,951
<i>This is Yogi Berra.
We're 30 seconds out.</i>

1005
00:53:03,113 --> 00:53:06,720
With a water temperature of 36°F
and a wind chill of -5°,

1006
00:53:06,884 --> 00:53:09,797
the surviving passengers of Flight 1549

1007
00:53:09,953 --> 00:53:12,297
literally have minutes to live.

1008
00:53:12,456 --> 00:53:15,130
We're five out.
We have visual on aircraft.

1009
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:21,331
<i>All right, give me your hand.</i>

1010
00:53:21,498 --> 00:53:23,842
If anybody's got any problems,
just wait down there.

1011
00:53:24,001 --> 00:53:26,572
We got some really good people
coming on their way, all right'?

1013
00:53:40,317 --> 00:53:41,853
Stand by.

1014
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:50,197
Fifty yards, go.

1015
00:54:04,742 --> 00:54:05,846
You okay?

1016
00:54:06,009 --> 00:54:07,920
I got you. You're gonna be okay.
All right?

1017
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:09,079
Got you.

1018
00:54:11,782 --> 00:54:13,386
Is anyone still here? Come forward.

1019
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:15,086
Captain. Come back.

1020
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:16,731
Come forward.

1021
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:23,360
We need to get off the plane now.

1022
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:37,117
<i>Captain. We have to go.</i>

1024
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:39,276
<i>It's time to 
get off the plane, right now.</i>

1025
00:54:49,987 --> 00:54:53,161
<i>All right, you guys go.
I'll be right behind you.</i>

1026
00:55:06,804 --> 00:55:08,681
We gotta go.

1028
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:23,821
Thank you.

1029
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:30,835
Everybody's okay.
Help is on the way.

1030
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:35,336
<i>Twenty-six passengers
going to Port Imperial.</i>

1031
00:55:35,499 --> 00:55:37,501
<i>Nineteen headed to Pier 81.</i>

1032
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:41,138
<i>We got 24 passengers on board
headed to Port Imperial.</i>

1033
00:55:41,305 --> 00:55:43,285
Whoever has miraculously survived

1034
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,545
this plummet from the skies
into the icy Hudson

1035
00:55:45,709 --> 00:55:48,781
has about 300 of New York's finest
ready to help them.

1036
00:55:48,946 --> 00:55:52,189
The only question remaining
is will it be too late?

1037
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:54,659
In Manhattan, 
Bobby Cuza, New York One.

1038
00:55:54,818 --> 00:55:55,956
Come on, sir. Give me your hand.

1039
00:55:56,119 --> 00:55:57,120
Grab on.

1040
00:55:57,287 --> 00:55:58,891
Give me your hand, sir. It's okay.

1041
00:55:59,122 --> 00:56:00,533
We got you.

1042
00:56:02,226 --> 00:56:03,899
- My hands.
- Gotta warm them up.

1043
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:05,965
Get him a blanket, fast.

1045
00:56:13,704 --> 00:56:15,377
I was sure I was gonna die.

1046
00:56:15,973 --> 00:56:18,180
Hey, no one dies today.

1047
00:56:22,412 --> 00:56:23,720
Give me your hand.

1048
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,666
Here you go, Captain. This way.

1049
00:56:33,991 --> 00:56:35,163
Give us your hand, sir.

1050
00:56:35,325 --> 00:56:36,668
Wrap it around your arms.

1051
00:56:38,161 --> 00:56:39,663
- Climb out now.
- Give me your hand.

1053
00:56:45,335 --> 00:56:47,110
Can we get
a couple more blankets over here?

1054
00:56:47,271 --> 00:56:48,272
<i>Thank you.</i>

1055
00:56:48,505 --> 00:56:50,746
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

1056
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:52,276
Give him some room.

1057
00:56:52,442 --> 00:56:53,716
You're welcome.

1059
00:57:15,299 --> 00:57:16,369
Hello?

1060
00:57:16,533 --> 00:57:18,308
<i>I wanted to call to say I'm okay.</i>

1061
00:57:18,468 --> 00:57:20,379
Good. 
Are you still on the 5:50 home?

1062
00:57:20,537 --> 00:57:21,641
<i>There's been an incident.</i>

1063
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,885
I'm okay, not a scratch somehow.

1064
00:57:25,309 --> 00:57:26,617
Turn on the television.

1065
00:57:26,877 --> 00:57:29,050
What do you mean 
"Turn on the television"?

1066
00:57:29,379 --> 00:57:30,722
Lorrie, I can't talk right now.

1067
00:57:30,881 --> 00:57:33,054
I will call you from the pier
when things quiet down.

1068
00:57:34,551 --> 00:57:37,157
I had to land in the Hudson.

1069
00:57:38,388 --> 00:57:40,561
I don't understand.

1070
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:44,565
I love you, and I'm okay.
Tell the girls I am okay.

1071
00:57:46,396 --> 00:57:48,000
I have to go.

1072
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:51,737
Girls, turn on the TV.

1073
00:57:54,404 --> 00:57:56,509
<i>An extensive rescue effort is underway</i>

1074
00:57:56,673 --> 00:57:59,916
<i>after a US Airways Flight
crashes into the Hudson River,</i>

1075
00:58:00,077 --> 00:58:02,614
<i>sending passengers scrambling for safety.
- Oh my God.</i>

1078
00:58:24,267 --> 00:58:25,541
If you have any wet clothing on,
take it off

1079
00:58:25,702 --> 00:58:27,943
and wrap up in a blanket
from the Red Cross.

1080
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:40,450
You're gonna be okay. Lucille?

1081
00:58:40,617 --> 00:58:43,063
I'm gonna lake you right
to the ambulance, all right?

1082
00:58:45,989 --> 00:58:48,299
Maybe he's here.
Maybe he beat us somehow.

1083
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:51,703
There's lots of boats. Jeff.

1084
00:58:54,231 --> 00:58:56,534
Sully.
- Dan.

1086
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:03,878
I need to know who's hurt
and how badly, and I need a count.

1087
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:06,681
155, that's my number.
That's passengers and crew.

1088
00:59:06,843 --> 00:59:08,345
Okay. How are you?

1089
00:59:08,512 --> 00:59:11,049
I'll answer that question
when we've counted 155.

1090
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:12,318
All right.

1091
00:59:12,482 --> 00:59:14,257
Honey, it's me.

1092
00:59:15,352 --> 00:59:17,525
Sort of. I won't be home tonight.

1094
00:59:19,356 --> 00:59:22,030
Sherri, I cannot believe
l'm talking to you.

1096
00:59:28,532 --> 00:59:31,206
Captain. I'm here to escort you
to meet with Mayor Bloomberg

1097
00:59:31,368 --> 00:59:32,904
and Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly.

1098
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:34,947
If the Mayor wants to say hello,
he'll have to come down here.

1099
00:59:35,105 --> 00:59:36,106
We're still working.

1100
00:59:36,273 --> 00:59:38,412
I can keep assembling the count.

1101
00:59:39,042 --> 00:59:42,212
Jeff, I need a count.
We've gotta have a count.

1103
00:59:42,379 --> 00:59:43,687
There's no way to get
a real count out here.

1104
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:45,248
Jeff's right.

1105
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:47,258
Let's get you in some dry clothes
before you freeze to death.

1106
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:50,023
What if the Mayor and Chief Kelly
come down here to meet with you'?

1107
00:59:50,287 --> 00:59:52,198
Because it was a domestic flight--

1108
00:59:52,355 --> 00:59:53,698
Yeah, we got no manifest.

1109
00:59:53,857 --> 00:59:56,565
We're gonna have to track
the passenger information down one by one.

1110
00:59:56,726 --> 00:59:58,034
- Can you help?
- Yeah.

1111
00:59:58,195 --> 00:59:59,868
I'm gonna call John Carey.
We're gonna get you a count.

1112
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:02,869
Listen. You've done enough.
Let me take it from here.

1114
01:00:14,478 --> 01:00:16,583
Jeff?

1115
01:00:16,746 --> 01:00:17,816
I'm okay.

1116
01:00:17,981 --> 01:00:19,983
I was on the other wing.
They brought us to Jersey.

1117
01:00:20,417 --> 01:00:23,421
I couldn't see you. 
I couldn't find you.

1118
01:00:23,587 --> 01:00:25,396
<i>I could hear you shouting
my name the whole time.</i>

1119
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,398
I shouted back. 
I guess the river...

1120
01:00:28,892 --> 01:00:29,893
<i>Are you okay?</i>

1121
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:31,334
I love you, son.

1122
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:34,939
I love you, too.

1123
01:00:35,899 --> 01:00:37,572
 Can you believe we made it?

1124
01:00:40,003 --> 01:00:43,680
I mean, the plane crashed on the river.

1126
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:45,453
Are you kidding me'?

1128
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:50,647
So unbelievable.

1129
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:11,505
I've never been so happy
to be in New York in my life.

1130
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:24,014
Patty.

1131
01:01:24,314 --> 01:01:25,622
Supe sent me looking for you.

1132
01:01:25,782 --> 01:01:27,227
Everyone's going nuts up top.

1133
01:01:27,384 --> 01:01:29,625
- Aren't you coming?
- I guess you didn't hear.

1134
01:01:29,786 --> 01:01:32,232
I lost Cactus 1549 in the Hudson.

1135
01:01:32,989 --> 01:01:36,163
I guess you haven't heard.
He landed the son of a bitch.

1136
01:01:36,459 --> 01:01:37,699
What?

1137
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:40,307
Everyone's been pulled off.
It's a miracle.

1138
01:01:40,463 --> 01:01:42,340
I thought I lost them all.

1139
01:01:42,499 --> 01:01:44,638
- They've got to get a TV in here.
- Yeah. Seriously.

1140
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:49,243
What is my pulse rate?

1141
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:51,477
It's 110.

1142
01:01:52,175 --> 01:01:54,052
My normal resting is 55.

1143
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:55,417
110...

1144
01:01:56,246 --> 01:02:00,251
That's not good.
You are right. 110 is not good.

1146
01:02:00,417 --> 01:02:03,728
After what you just went through,
110 is extraordinary.

1147
01:02:03,887 --> 01:02:07,266
How is Doreen?
- Fairly severe laceration.

1149
01:02:07,424 --> 01:02:09,062
We'll keep her a day or two
to stem the infection.

1150
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:10,364
But she'll be okay?

1151
01:02:10,527 --> 01:02:12,905
She'll have a scar
and a hell of a story to tell.

1152
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:14,064
Although no one will believe her.

1153
01:02:14,231 --> 01:02:16,541
Hell, I'm standing here with you right now
and I don't believe it.

1154
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:18,373
You landed a <i>plane</i> on the <i>Hudson.</i>
Not a scratch on you.

1155
01:02:18,535 --> 01:02:19,570
Arnie.

1156
01:02:20,937 --> 01:02:23,747
The union is pulling out
all the big guns today?

1157
01:02:25,242 --> 01:02:28,951
Talked to Dan Britt.
Got a count.

1159
01:02:29,946 --> 01:02:31,254
155.

1160
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:35,191
155.

1161
01:02:35,352 --> 01:02:36,524
It's official.

1162
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:44,303
-155.
-155.

1164
01:02:44,928 --> 01:02:46,566
Thank you.

1165
01:03:18,428 --> 01:03:20,305
- Hey, Carl.
- Jeff.

1166
01:03:21,431 --> 01:03:22,808
- Sully.
- Carl.

1167
01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:24,741
Hell of a thing you pulled off
out there today.

1168
01:03:24,901 --> 01:03:25,936
We're here.

1169
01:03:26,102 --> 01:03:27,979
It's about all I know at the moment.

1170
01:03:28,438 --> 01:03:30,076
this is Ms. May, with the hotel.

1171
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,651
Wanted to have a quick word with you.

1172
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:33,082
I won't take your time, gentlemen.

1173
01:03:33,243 --> 01:03:35,751
This is only to say that my staff and I
are committed to protecting your privacy.

1175
01:03:35,912 --> 01:03:38,415
So, if there's anything I can do at all...

1176
01:03:38,581 --> 01:03:41,755
If it's possible, I'd love to have
my uniform dry-cleaned overnight.

1177
01:03:41,918 --> 01:03:43,329
It's the only clothing that I have.

1178
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:44,487
Dry-cleaning?

1179
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:46,258
If it's too much... 
If it's too late...

1180
01:03:46,423 --> 01:03:47,595
Are you kidding?

1181
01:03:47,757 --> 01:03:50,636
Captain Sullenberger,
I'd give you this whole hotel if I could.

1183
01:03:55,465 --> 01:03:57,604
Thank you very much.

1184
01:03:57,767 --> 01:03:59,610
Anything for Sully.

1185
01:03:59,769 --> 01:04:01,180
Have a blessed day.

1186
01:04:03,606 --> 01:04:04,983
What just happened?

1187
01:04:05,141 --> 01:04:07,348
You just got hugged by a total stranger.

1188
01:04:08,778 --> 01:04:10,280
Come on.

1189
01:04:10,447 --> 01:04:12,449
When's the last time you heard of someone

1190
01:04:12,615 --> 01:04:16,461
landing a jet plane on the water
and everybody lived?

1192
01:04:18,955 --> 01:04:19,956
Exactly.

1193
01:04:20,457 --> 01:04:24,132
I got shaving cream,
razor blades, toothpaste.

1194
01:04:25,495 --> 01:04:27,304
And new clothes.

1195
01:04:28,798 --> 01:04:30,835
What, did you think we were ninjas?

1196
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,673
K-mart was the only store open.

1197
01:04:32,836 --> 01:04:36,650
It's Queens. It's 10:00 in the evening.
You find a Brooks Brothers store.

1200
01:04:39,809 --> 01:04:41,550
What are you 
even still doing in uniform?

1201
01:04:41,811 --> 01:04:43,552
I don't know.

1202
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:47,320
It's been a long day.
Why don't you get some rest?

1203
01:04:47,484 --> 01:04:51,330
Mike Cleary will be over in the a.m.
and make sure you're both doing okay.

1204
01:04:52,155 --> 01:04:54,260
- Thank you, Carl.
- Thank you, Captain.

1205
01:04:55,058 --> 01:04:57,504
It's been a while since
New York had news this good.

1206
01:04:59,262 --> 01:05:00,536
Especially with an airplane in it.

1207
01:05:10,373 --> 01:05:11,852
I'll see you later.

1209
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:37,609
<i>The word city officials
keep repeating is "timing."</i>

1210
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:40,907
<i>The perfect timing 
of the NYPD scuba units</i>

1211
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:43,072
<i>and of the ferry boat captains,</i>

1212
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:47,415
<i>and of course, the inexplicably
precise timing of the pilot.</i>

1213
01:05:47,577 --> 01:05:50,956
<i>Captain "Sully" Sullenberger,
who, with almost no time,</i>

1214
01:05:51,114 --> 01:05:53,390
<i>became a man for all time.</i>

1215
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:54,617
<i>This is Kristine Johnson...</i>

1216
01:05:54,818 --> 01:05:55,819
The timing.

1217
01:05:56,052 --> 01:05:57,588
<i>...reporting live 
from the Hudson River.</i>

1218
01:05:57,787 --> 01:05:58,788
<i>New York One Minute.</i>

1219
01:05:58,988 --> 01:06:00,934
<i>The coast guard released this new video
of Flight 1549</i>

1220
01:06:01,157 --> 01:06:03,137
<i>making an emergency landing
on the Hudson.</i>

1221
01:06:03,293 --> 01:06:06,240
<i>Meanwhile, the search is launched
for the engine of the aircraft.</i>

1222
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:10,569
Let me...

1223
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:20,947
Come on. Answer.

1225
01:06:21,778 --> 01:06:25,453
The CUR is in two days.
How fast can you arrange a favor?

1227
01:06:26,950 --> 01:06:30,591
<i>I know that Airbus has simulations
scheduled for the S22 sim at the factory.</i>

1228
01:06:30,753 --> 01:06:34,326
<i>But that's next week in Toulouse.
Can you get them to reschedule?</i>

1229
01:06:34,491 --> 01:06:35,765
It's 1:30 in the morning.

1230
01:06:35,925 --> 01:06:37,029
<i>I need you to make it happen</i>

1231
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:38,637
before we listen to the CUR.

1232
01:06:38,795 --> 01:06:40,775
Before our testimony is complete.

1233
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:42,102
Why?

1234
01:06:42,765 --> 01:06:45,644
I have a right to see the simulations
and I have a feeling that

1235
01:06:45,802 --> 01:06:49,181
with human pilots and not a computer,
the results are going to be different.

1236
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:51,785
What if they show the exact same result?

1237
01:06:53,109 --> 01:06:55,282
If they do,
then I'll hand you my wings myself.

1238
01:06:55,445 --> 01:06:56,822
It's all about the timing.

1239
01:06:56,980 --> 01:06:58,960
You can accomplish anything
if you're never in a hurry.

1240
01:06:59,115 --> 01:07:00,856
I sure as hell agree with that.

1241
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:03,327
The CVR is on Wednesday. 
That's 36 hours.

1242
01:07:03,486 --> 01:07:04,829
Can you make it happen?

1243
01:07:04,988 --> 01:07:07,628
<i>I'll try.
It's a lot of phone calls to make.</i>

1244
01:07:07,790 --> 01:07:09,292
It's already 7:30 
in the morning in France,

1245
01:07:09,459 --> 01:07:10,563
so you better get started.

1246
01:07:10,727 --> 01:07:12,638
Thank you.

1249
01:07:32,582 --> 01:07:35,688
<i>Sorry to bother you
before the hearing.</i>

1250
01:07:35,852 --> 01:07:38,264
What happened?

1251
01:07:39,556 --> 01:07:45,268
I realized just now,
for the first time...

1252
01:07:46,195 --> 01:07:50,200
that there were 155 people
on that plane, and you were one of them.

1253
01:07:51,568 --> 01:07:53,445
We almost lost you.

1254
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:57,074
But you didn't. I'm right here.

1255
01:07:58,708 --> 01:08:00,517
How are you holding up?

1256
01:08:00,677 --> 01:08:02,213
I'm holding up.

1257
01:08:02,378 --> 01:08:04,255
Please tell me this is almost over.

1258
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:06,351
It's almost over.

1259
01:08:06,516 --> 01:08:07,517
Okay.

1260
01:08:07,684 --> 01:08:08,788
I love you.

1261
01:08:08,952 --> 01:08:10,397
I have you, too.

1262
01:08:10,553 --> 01:08:12,726
I'll call you 
when they're done with me.

1265
01:08:41,384 --> 01:08:43,330
Let's go.

1266
01:08:53,997 --> 01:08:56,341
- Good morning.

1267
01:08:56,933 --> 01:08:58,344
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen,
and welcome.

1268
01:08:58,568 --> 01:08:59,740
My name is Charles Porter.

1269
01:08:59,936 --> 01:09:02,576
I've been assigned by the
National Transportation Safety Board

1270
01:09:02,772 --> 01:09:05,116
to conduct this public hearing today.

1271
01:09:05,408 --> 01:09:07,149
We have a lot of material to cover.

1272
01:09:07,744 --> 01:09:10,418
But before we listen to
the cockpit voice recording...

1273
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:12,457
And we will be listening to it
for the first time

1274
01:09:12,615 --> 01:09:14,094
along with you, gentlemen.

1275
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:17,629
Per the request of
Captain Sullenberger and the union,

1276
01:09:17,787 --> 01:09:19,994
Airbus has agreed to 
link us via satellite

1277
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:22,261
to today's piloted simulations.

1278
01:09:22,425 --> 01:09:24,098
Upload link, please.

1279
01:09:24,927 --> 01:09:26,600
They're just simulations.

1280
01:09:26,763 --> 01:09:29,004
Won't change my mind
about what happened up there.

1281
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:31,441
Might change theirs.

1283
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:42,045
Birds.

1284
01:09:43,980 --> 01:09:45,618
Number one's rolling back. 
And number two.

1285
01:09:45,782 --> 01:09:46,954
Auto pilot's off.

1286
01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:49,487
- Pilot off.
- Flight Director's off.

1287
01:09:49,652 --> 01:09:50,824
<i>Flight Director is off.</i>

1288
01:09:50,987 --> 01:09:53,797
All right. LaGuardia, Cactus 1549,
dual engine failure.

1289
01:09:53,956 --> 01:09:55,299
We have to return to the field.

1290
01:09:55,458 --> 01:09:58,132
I'm gonna left turn
back to LaGuardia 1-3.

1291
01:09:58,294 --> 01:10:00,137
I'll activate the approach for you.

1292
01:10:00,830 --> 01:10:02,366
<i>It's activated.</i>

1293
01:10:02,532 --> 01:10:03,977
<i>Runway 1-3.</i>

1294
01:10:06,135 --> 01:10:08,012
<i>Glide slopes coming in nicely.</i>

1295
01:10:08,738 --> 01:10:10,718
- Flaps two.
- Flaps two.

1296
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:13,714
<i>Sink Rate 900.</i>

1298
01:10:16,846 --> 01:10:18,553
<i>Too low, flaps.</i>

1299
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:20,493
<i>Flight slow.</i>

1300
01:10:20,650 --> 01:10:22,152
<i>Too low, flaps.</i>

1301
01:10:22,318 --> 01:10:25,527
40, 20...

1302
01:10:33,029 --> 01:10:36,203
<i>Successful landing
at LaGuardia, runway 1-3.</i>

1303
01:10:37,667 --> 01:10:38,668
For the record,

1304
01:10:38,868 --> 01:10:41,872
the pilots and the computer
sims bear the same result.

1305
01:10:43,172 --> 01:10:45,379
Let's try for Teterboro now, please.

1306
01:10:46,509 --> 01:10:48,182
<i>Upload the second run.</i>

1307
01:10:52,548 --> 01:10:53,856
Birds.

1309
01:10:58,588 --> 01:10:59,965
Give me a heading 3-1-0.

1310
01:11:00,223 --> 01:11:01,759
Heading 3-1-0.

1311
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,296
I'm gonna give you direct to Teterboro.

1312
01:11:05,461 --> 01:11:06,735
Direct Teterboro.

1313
01:11:14,203 --> 01:11:15,204
<i> One thousand.</i>

1314
01:11:15,905 --> 01:11:17,111
Flaps two.

1315
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:18,479
Flaps two.

1316
01:11:23,813 --> 01:11:25,588
Too low, terrain.

1317
01:11:25,815 --> 01:11:27,317
<i>Too low, terrain.</i>

1318
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:28,925
<i>Too low, terrain.</i>

1319
01:11:30,253 --> 01:11:34,292
<i>50, 40, 30, 20...</i>

1320
01:11:37,994 --> 01:11:40,474
Successful landing
at Teterboro, runway 1-9.

1321
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:48,412
<i>Multiple airports, runways,
two successful landings.</i>

1322
01:11:49,939 --> 01:11:53,011
We are simply mimicking
what the computer already told us.

1323
01:11:53,776 --> 01:11:57,155
A lot of toes were stepped on
in order to set this up for today.

1324
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:02,956
And frankly, I really don't know
what you gentlemen plan to gain by it.

1325
01:12:03,486 --> 01:12:05,625
Can we get serious now?

1326
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:08,458
Captain?

1327
01:12:08,624 --> 01:12:10,160
We've all heard about
the computer simulations

1328
01:12:10,359 --> 01:12:12,930
and now we are watching actual sims.

1329
01:12:13,095 --> 01:12:15,268
But I can't quite believe

1330
01:12:16,132 --> 01:12:20,376
you still have not taken
into account the human factor.

1331
01:12:20,703 --> 01:12:22,046
Human piloted simulations

1332
01:12:22,205 --> 01:12:24,048
showed that you could
make it back to the airport.

1333
01:12:24,507 --> 01:12:25,815
No, they don't.

1334
01:12:26,475 --> 01:12:29,149
These pilots were not behaving
like human beings,

1335
01:12:29,312 --> 01:12:31,815
like people who are experiencing this
for the first time.

1336
01:12:31,981 --> 01:12:33,619
They may not be reacting
like you did.

1337
01:12:33,783 --> 01:12:37,054
Immediately after the bird strike
they are turning back for the airport.

1339
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:40,356
Just as in the computer sims, correct?
- That is correct.

1341
01:12:40,523 --> 01:12:43,834
They obviously knew the turn
and exactly what heading to fly.

1342
01:12:43,993 --> 01:12:46,837
They did not run a check.
They did not switch on the APU.

1344
01:12:46,996 --> 01:12:49,306
They had all the same
parameters that you faced.

1345
01:12:49,465 --> 01:12:55,045
No one warned us. No one said,
"You are going to lose both engines..."

1347
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:57,844
"...at a lower altitude
than any jet in history."

1348
01:12:58,507 --> 01:13:02,187
"But be cool, just make 
a left turn for LaGuardia..."

1350
01:13:02,345 --> 01:13:04,586
"like you're going back
to pick up the milk."

1351
01:13:05,248 --> 01:13:10,490
This was dual engine loss at 2,800 feet
followed by an immediate water landing

1353
01:13:10,653 --> 01:13:13,224
with 155 souls on board.

1354
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:18,361
No one has ever trained
for an incident like that. No one.

1356
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:22,706
The Teterboro landing,
with its unrealistic bank angle

1357
01:13:22,932 --> 01:13:25,242
We were not the Thunderbirds up there.

1358
01:13:25,768 --> 01:13:28,078
I'd like to know how many times
the pilot practiced that maneuver,

1359
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:30,342
before he actually pulled it off.

1360
01:13:31,607 --> 01:13:34,787
I'm not questioning the pilots.
They're good pilots.

1362
01:13:35,878 --> 01:13:38,882
But they've clearly been instructed
to head for the airport

1363
01:13:39,048 --> 01:13:40,857
immediately after the bird strike.

1364
01:13:41,384 --> 01:13:44,194
You've allowed no time for analysis
or decision-making.

1365
01:13:44,587 --> 01:13:48,535
In these simulations, you've taken
all of the humanity out of the cockpit.

1366
01:13:49,458 --> 01:13:53,565
How much time did the pilots
spend planning for this event?

1367
01:13:53,729 --> 01:13:55,265
For these simulations?

1368
01:13:58,768 --> 01:14:01,112
You are looking for human error.

1369
01:14:02,538 --> 01:14:04,245
Then make it human.

1370
01:14:09,211 --> 01:14:11,282
This wasn't a video game.

1371
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:13,222
It was life and death.

1372
01:14:13,749 --> 01:14:15,922
Sully's right. 
That's worth a few seconds.

1373
01:14:16,085 --> 01:14:18,565
Please ask how many
practice runs they had.

1374
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:20,934
Seventeen.

1377
01:14:27,096 --> 01:14:28,803
Seventeen?

1378
01:14:30,066 --> 01:14:35,573
The pilot who landed at Teterboro
had 17 practice attempts

1379
01:14:35,738 --> 01:14:38,412
before the simulation we just witnessed.

1380
01:14:43,079 --> 01:14:45,821
Your reaction decision time
will be set at 35 seconds.

1381
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:49,759
Thirty-five seconds.
That's not enough time.

1382
01:14:50,286 --> 01:14:52,960
We only had 208 seconds total,

1383
01:14:53,923 --> 01:14:55,266
so I'll take it.

1384
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:56,932
Upload the link.

1385
01:14:57,093 --> 01:14:58,470
Return to LaGuardia.

1386
01:14:58,627 --> 01:15:01,164
Now with an added
35-second delay in response time.

1387
01:15:06,302 --> 01:15:08,179
Birds.
Okay, I saw them.

1388
01:15:08,437 --> 01:15:10,314
- Give me 35 seconds.
- 35 seconds.

1389
01:15:17,947 --> 01:15:19,017
Time's up.

1390
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:20,353
Here we go.

1391
01:15:21,784 --> 01:15:23,024
Flight path vector.

1392
01:15:28,624 --> 01:15:29,694
Going for 1-3.

1393
01:15:29,859 --> 01:15:30,860
Okay.

1394
01:15:31,327 --> 01:15:32,533
Activate confirm.

1395
01:15:32,695 --> 01:15:34,834
All right. You are confirmed.

1396
01:15:36,999 --> 01:15:38,808
We're heading right for the airport.

1397
01:15:47,476 --> 01:15:48,716
Caution, obstacle.

1398
01:15:49,645 --> 01:15:51,147
Caution, obstacle.

1399
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:53,858
We're about
seven miles from the runway.

1400
01:15:55,818 --> 01:15:57,525
Caution, obstacle.

1401
01:15:57,987 --> 01:15:59,557
Terrain.

1402
01:16:00,656 --> 01:16:09,265
<i>Pull up.</i>

1405
01:16:08,264 --> 01:16:09,265
<i>Pull up.</i>

1406
01:16:09,865 --> 01:16:11,708
<i>Too low, terrain.</i>

1407
01:16:12,168 --> 01:16:13,670
We got a little extra speed.

1408
01:16:13,836 --> 01:16:14,837
You want some flaps?

1409
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:17,016
Too low, terrain.

1410
01:16:17,173 --> 01:16:18,345
No, leave the flaps up.

1411
01:16:20,042 --> 01:16:25,052
Too low, terrain.

1414
01:16:26,215 --> 01:16:30,220
Fifty, 40, 30, 20...

1416
01:16:43,766 --> 01:16:45,439
Let's try Teterboro.

1417
01:16:47,536 --> 01:16:48,776
Upload the link, please.

1418
01:16:52,708 --> 01:16:53,743
Birds.

1419
01:16:53,909 --> 01:16:55,582
Auto pilot off.
Flight Director off.

1420
01:16:55,744 --> 01:16:56,745
Hack the time.

1421
01:16:56,979 --> 01:16:58,617
- 35 seconds.
- 35 seconds.

1422
01:17:00,382 --> 01:17:02,055
Engine one and two fail.

1423
01:17:06,388 --> 01:17:07,389
<i>Turn.</i>

1425
01:17:10,893 --> 01:17:12,736
Let's see if we can make it.

1426
01:17:17,099 --> 01:17:18,305
Heading sub 2-9-8.

1427
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:19,946
You seeing Teterboro out there?

1428
01:17:20,102 --> 01:17:21,274
I do.

1429
01:17:25,574 --> 01:17:27,076
Way too low.

1430
01:17:29,945 --> 01:17:31,754
Obstacle.

1431
01:17:32,581 --> 01:17:42,458
Pull up.

1436
01:17:43,826 --> 01:17:45,965
Not gonna work.

1441
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:09,291
Does anyone need 
to see more simulations?

1442
01:18:13,122 --> 01:18:15,864
Now that we've seen
what could have happened,

1443
01:18:16,025 --> 01:18:18,471
Can we listen to what actually did?

1444
01:18:18,861 --> 01:18:21,842
We will look at all
the results at a later date.

1445
01:18:23,132 --> 01:18:24,338
Elizabeth.

1446
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:32,148
For the record, this is the CVR 
of US Airways Flight 1549, January 15th, 2009.

1449
01:18:32,308 --> 01:18:34,720
Gentlemen, headsets.

1451
01:19:02,004 --> 01:19:03,005
Birds.

1453
01:19:09,878 --> 01:19:11,551
Shit.

1454
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:13,120
Yeah.

1455
01:19:14,683 --> 01:19:16,356
We got one rolling back.

1456
01:19:19,521 --> 01:19:21,797
We have both of them rolling back.

1457
01:19:26,228 --> 01:19:27,229
Ignition start.

1459
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:34,910
I'm starting the APU.

1460
01:19:41,577 --> 01:19:43,147
- My aircraft.
- Your aircraft.

1461
01:19:43,646 --> 01:19:44,886
Get out the QRH.

1462
01:19:45,047 --> 01:19:46,549
Priority left.

1463
01:19:46,715 --> 01:19:48,058
Loss of thrust on both engines.

1464
01:19:48,317 --> 01:19:50,422
Mayday, mayday, mayday.
This is Cactus 1549.

1465
01:19:50,586 --> 01:19:52,566
Hit birds.
We've lost thrust on both engines.

1466
01:19:52,721 --> 01:19:54,394
We are turning back towards LaGuardia.

1467
01:19:54,890 --> 01:19:56,062
Okay, you need to 
return to LaGuardia?

1468
01:19:56,225 --> 01:19:57,898
Turn left heading 2-2-0.
- 2-2-0.

1469
01:19:58,060 --> 01:20:00,472
- Which engine did you lose?
- <i>Both</i> engines.

1470
01:20:10,105 --> 01:20:12,016
"If fuel remaining engine mode,
select your ignition."

1471
01:20:12,241 --> 01:20:13,584
- Ignition.
- Ignition.

1472
01:20:13,742 --> 01:20:16,120
- Thrust levers, confirm idle.
- Idle.

1473
01:20:16,278 --> 01:20:18,690
Airspeed. Optimum relight, 300 knots.

1474
01:20:19,281 --> 01:20:21,693
- We don't have that.
- No, we don't.

1475
01:20:23,285 --> 01:20:24,992
Cactus 1549,
if we can get it for you,

1476
01:20:25,154 --> 01:20:26,633
do you wanna try to land runway 1-3?

1477
01:20:28,691 --> 01:20:31,035
We are unable.
We may end up in the Hudson.

1478
01:20:32,428 --> 01:20:35,204
Emergency electrical power,
emergency generator not online.

1479
01:20:35,364 --> 01:20:36,934
Online.

1480
01:20:37,099 --> 01:20:39,875
ATC notified. Squawk 7700.

1481
01:20:40,035 --> 01:20:41,708
Distress message transmit. 
We did that.

1482
01:20:41,870 --> 01:20:44,783
Cactus 1549,
it's gonna be left traffic, runway 3-1.

1483
01:20:45,274 --> 01:20:46,275
Unable.

1484
01:20:46,442 --> 01:20:47,887
Okay. What do you need to land?

1485
01:20:48,043 --> 01:20:49,147
Wind shear.

1486
01:20:49,445 --> 01:20:51,288
FAC 1 off, then on.

1487
01:21:04,626 --> 01:21:06,799
Been 10 seconds, Captain. 
Come on.

1488
01:21:06,962 --> 01:21:08,168
Talk to me.

1489
01:21:08,330 --> 01:21:12,576
Cactus 1549, runway 4 is available if you 
wanna make left traffic to runway 4.

1491
01:21:12,735 --> 01:21:14,180
I don't think 
we can make any runway.

1492
01:21:14,336 --> 01:21:16,316
What about over to our right?

1493
01:21:16,472 --> 01:21:17,849
Anything in New Jersey? 
Maybe Teterboro?

1494
01:21:18,006 --> 01:21:20,008
Off your right side is Teterboro airport.

1495
01:21:20,676 --> 01:21:23,316
LaGuardia Departure,
got an emergency inbound.

1496
01:21:23,479 --> 01:21:25,015
This is Teterboro tower. 
Go ahead.

1497
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:27,160
Cactus 1549 over the GW Bridge.

1498
01:21:27,316 --> 01:21:28,590
Needs to go 
to the airport right now.

1499
01:21:28,751 --> 01:21:30,025
Check. Does he need assistance?

1500
01:21:30,185 --> 01:21:32,324
Yes. Bird strike.
Can I get him in for runway 1?

1501
01:21:39,495 --> 01:21:41,833
Cactus 1549, you wanna
try and go to Teterboro?

1503
01:21:42,998 --> 01:21:49,706
<i>Obstacle.</i>

1505
01:21:51,173 --> 01:21:52,174
<i>Pull up.</i>

1506
01:21:52,341 --> 01:21:53,684
<i>Clear of conflict.</i>

1507
01:21:53,842 --> 01:21:56,516
"No relight after 30 seconds,
engine master one and two, confirm off.“

1508
01:21:56,678 --> 01:21:57,679
Off.

1509
01:21:58,514 --> 01:22:00,016
"Wait 30 seconds."

1510
01:22:00,182 --> 01:22:07,058
<i>Too low, terrain.</i>

1514
01:22:15,197 --> 01:22:16,699
This is the captain.

1515
01:22:17,299 --> 01:22:18,710
Brace for impact.

1516
01:22:22,037 --> 01:22:23,209
Five hundred.

1517
01:22:30,712 --> 01:22:32,385
Cactus 1549, tum right 2-8-0.

1518
01:22:32,548 --> 01:22:34,084
You can land runway one Teterboro.

1519
01:22:34,249 --> 01:22:35,557
We can't make it.

1520
01:22:35,717 --> 01:22:37,390
Which runway
would you like at Teterboro?

1521
01:22:37,553 --> 01:22:38,827
Go ahead. Try number one.

1522
01:22:38,987 --> 01:22:40,489
Number one.

1523
01:22:40,722 --> 01:22:42,167
No relight.

1524
01:22:43,225 --> 01:22:44,499
We're gonna end up in the Hudson.

1526
01:22:45,828 --> 01:22:47,273
I'm sorry. Say again, Cactus?

1528
01:23:00,909 --> 01:23:03,082
All right, let's put the flaps out.
Put the flaps out.

1529
01:23:03,245 --> 01:23:04,246
Flaps out.

1530
01:23:04,413 --> 01:23:06,017
Cactus 1549, radar contact lost.

1531
01:23:06,181 --> 01:23:08,923
You also got Newark off your two o'clock
in about seven miles.

1532
01:23:09,084 --> 01:23:10,188
Got flaps out.

1533
01:23:10,352 --> 01:23:12,025
Two hundred fifty feet in the air.

1534
01:23:17,659 --> 01:23:19,866
170 knots. Got no power on either one.
Try the other one.

1535
01:23:20,028 --> 01:23:21,029
Try the other one.

1536
01:23:21,263 --> 01:23:22,867
1549? Still up?

1537
01:23:23,098 --> 01:23:24,441
One hundred and fifty knots.

1538
01:23:24,867 --> 01:23:27,279
- Got flaps two. You want more?
- No. Let's stay at two.

1539
01:23:27,436 --> 01:23:28,779
You got runway 2-9 
available at Newark.

1540
01:23:28,937 --> 01:23:30,143
It'll be two o'clock 
in seven miles.

1541
01:23:30,305 --> 01:23:32,114
You got any ideas?

1542
01:23:32,608 --> 01:23:33,609
Actually not.

1550
01:23:50,058 --> 01:23:51,332
We're gonna brace.

1556
01:24:38,674 --> 01:24:41,678
I need to take a quick break.

1558
01:24:55,891 --> 01:24:57,529
What did you think?

1559
01:24:58,627 --> 01:25:01,369
Hearing the CVR just now?

1560
01:25:03,865 --> 01:25:05,708
Let me tell you what I think.

1561
01:25:07,736 --> 01:25:09,306
I'm just so damn proud.

1562
01:25:11,039 --> 01:25:13,883
And you were right there,
through all that distraction.

1563
01:25:14,042 --> 01:25:15,885
With <i>so</i> much at stake.

1564
01:25:18,413 --> 01:25:20,893
We did this together. 
We were a team.

1565
01:25:22,884 --> 01:25:24,090
Thanks.

1566
01:25:24,486 --> 01:25:26,591
We did our job.

1569
01:25:45,674 --> 01:25:49,244
- You did good.
- All right, folks.

1571
01:25:49,411 --> 01:25:50,788
I'd like to call this hearing
back to order.

1572
01:25:50,946 --> 01:25:52,619
If we could settle, please.

1573
01:25:54,583 --> 01:25:56,085
Take your seats.

1574
01:26:02,791 --> 01:26:06,936
That is honestly the first time
that I have listened to a crash recording

1576
01:26:07,996 --> 01:26:11,438
while actually sitting
with the captain and the first officer.

1578
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:15,671
It's extraordinary.

1579
01:26:17,205 --> 01:26:19,708
That was no simulation.

1580
01:26:20,776 --> 01:26:22,153
No, it wasn't.

1581
01:26:23,779 --> 01:26:29,290
Gentlemen, I want to inform you that
the left engine has been recovered.

1583
01:26:30,218 --> 01:26:32,630
We just received a comprehensive report.

1584
01:26:35,290 --> 01:26:36,963
There was extensive damage,

1585
01:26:37,125 --> 01:26:39,628
to both the guide vanes
and fan blades of the engine.

1586
01:26:39,795 --> 01:26:46,812
Five compressor blades were fractured
and eight variable guide vanes missing.

1588
01:26:47,402 --> 01:26:49,211
So, no thrust?

1589
01:26:49,371 --> 01:26:53,312
As you testified,
it was completely destroyed.

1591
01:26:53,475 --> 01:26:55,648
The ACARS data was wrong.

1592
01:27:00,482 --> 01:27:03,258
I'd like to add something
on a personal note.

1593
01:27:03,885 --> 01:27:05,762
I can say with absolute confidence

1594
01:27:05,921 --> 01:27:08,925
that after speaking
with the rest of the flight crew,

1595
01:27:09,691 --> 01:27:15,267
with bird experts, aviation engineers,
after running through every scenario,

1597
01:27:15,430 --> 01:27:20,612
after interviewing each player,
there is still an "X" in this result

1599
01:27:21,503 --> 01:27:24,177
and it's you, Captain Sullenberger.

1600
01:27:24,339 --> 01:27:29,345
Remove you from the equation,
and the math just fails.

1601
01:27:31,012 --> 01:27:32,753
I disagree.

1602
01:27:34,349 --> 01:27:37,193
It wasn't just me. 
It was all of us.

1603
01:27:37,352 --> 01:27:40,128
It was Jeff and Donna
and Sheila and Doreen

1604
01:27:40,956 --> 01:27:44,529
and all of the passengers,
the rescue workers,

1605
01:27:44,693 --> 1:27:49,541
air traffic control,
ferry boat crews and the scuba cops.

1607
01:27:51,633 --> 01:27:53,476
We all did it.

1608
01:27:54,436 --> 01:27:56,541
We survived.

1609
01:27:59,941 --> 01:28:04,048
First Officer Skiles, is there
anything you'd like to add?

1610
01:28:05,547 --> 01:28:07,652
Anything you would have done differently

1611
01:28:08,817 --> 01:28:10,490
if you had to do it again?

1612
01:28:11,553 --> 01:28:12,725
Yes.

1613
01:28:13,321 --> 01:28:14,959
I would have done it in July.

1615
01:29:50,652 --> 01:29:52,325
7F. 11F.

1616
01:29:52,487 --> 01:29:53,488
9D.

1617
01:29:53,688 --> 01:29:54,689
1C.

1618
01:29:54,856 --> 01:29:56,836
-25B.
-26B.

1619
01:29:57,092 --> 01:29:59,163
-10B.
-9A.

1620
01:29:59,327 --> 01:30:02,240
-13C.
-21A and B.

1621
01:30:02,831 --> 01:30:04,504
155 is a number,

1622
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:08,570
but when you can put faces to it

1623
01:30:08,737 --> 01:30:13,083
and not just 155 faces,
but the other faces,

1624
01:30:13,241 --> 01:30:17,189
the wives, the daughters, the sons,
the fathers, the mothers, the brothers,

1625
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:19,625
it gets to be a pretty big
number pretty quickly.

1626
01:30:19,948 --> 01:30:21,757
This is your Captain speaking.

1628
01:30:26,187 --> 01:30:31,364
I think today was as much and as good
for me and my crew as it was for you.

1629
01:30:31,693 --> 01:30:35,971
And because of the events
of January 15, 2009,

1630
01:30:36,131 --> 01:30:41,604
I'm convinced that we will be joined
in our hearts and in our minds forever.

1632
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:39,331
I am the keeper of the mail.

1633
01:31:40,095 --> 01:31:43,542
So I read when people
from across the country write to us.

1634
01:31:43,698 --> 01:31:47,339
And I open the letters
that come to our house from your families.

1635
01:31:47,502 --> 01:31:49,106
<i>And I open the Christmas cards.</i>

1636
01:31:49,270 --> 01:31:50,772
Thank you so much,

1637
01:31:50,939 --> 01:31:54,113
for the gratitude that you've
expressed to our families

1638
01:31:54,275 --> 01:31:56,619
and the letters and the cards

1639
01:31:56,778 --> 01:32:00,385
because they really do make
a difference to us as well.

1640
01:32:00,548 --> 01:32:01,891
Thank you.

1642
01:35:48,676 --> 01:35:49,677
