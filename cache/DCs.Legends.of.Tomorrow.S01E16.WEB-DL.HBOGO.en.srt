1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,800
<i>This season
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:03,640
I've assembled you all
because I need your help.

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,240
The future of the world is in peril
because of Vandal Savage.

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,320
You've turned your back
on the very institution

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,400
you were meant to serve.

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,640
The Time Masters, they refuse
to take action against Savage

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,880
because he didn't pose a threat
to the timeline.

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,640
The Oculus not only
gives us a window into time,

9
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,160
but the ability to shape it.

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,080
If the Oculus is what
they're using to control us,

11
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,840
then we need to destroy it.

12
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,800
Shut it down!

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,880
There are no strings on me.

14
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,440
He traded his life for ours.

15
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,520
He was a hero.

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,760
<i>Unfortunately, Vandal Savage
has already succeeded</i>

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,040
<i>in murdering Miranda and Jonas.</i>

18
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,880
<i>Savage still has Carter and Kendra.</i>

19
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,040
This is a timeship.

20
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,760
A little gift from our friends.

21
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,920
I no longer need to rule the world.

22
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,600
I now have the ability to change it.

23
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,440
What are we doing back here?

24
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,520
Savage has a timeship,
courtesy of the Time Masters.

25
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,560
The timeline is unclear,
due to our destruction

26
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,600
of the Oculus, meaning
Savage is lost to history.

27
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,160
Which is why I brought you all home.

28
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,400
- Mission's not over, man.
- Jax is right.

29
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,520
We've lost Savage before.
We'll find him again.

30
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,720
And then what?
We have no way of killing Savage,

31
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,840
particularly now that Kendra
and Carter are in his possession,

32
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,920
assuming that they're still alive,

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,880
which is highly unlikely.

34
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,000
So, that's it?

35
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,600
- We're... we're just giving up?
- I'm on my way

36
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,280
to the refuge
to retrieve our younger selves

37
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,560
and return them to the timeline.

38
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,560
It will be as if you never left.

39
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,840
What, you think that we can just

40
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,840
return to our old lives,
and then pretend

41
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,400
like none of this ever happened?

42
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,920
That might be a tad difficult.

43
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,000
So, I had to bring you back to
May 2016, not January 2016.

44
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,240
Great, so what you're saying
is for the last five months,

45
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,800
my mom probably thinks that I'm dead.

46
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,560
Thanks a lot, man.

47
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,760
Okay, wait, why?

48
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,960
Why the change of plans, Rip?

49
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,640
If you're getting back on that ship,

50
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,040
we get back on that ship.

51
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,400
In truth, I never left it.

52
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,480
I'm sorry for all
that I've asked of you,

53
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,560
and that it all came to nothing.

54
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,760
I wish you all well.

55
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,280
I never liked that guy.

56
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,760
Hello?

57
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,400
Hello?

58
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,880
Dad.

59
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,280
Hey.

60
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,640
{\an5}- Hi, Daddy.
- Baby.

61
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,480
{\an5}- When'd you get back?
- I just got back.

62
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
{\an5}I tried calling,
but nobody was answering.

63
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,720
{\an5}I was at Laurel's,
but she wasn't there.

64
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,200
Where is everyone?

65
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,880
This Damien Darhk,

66
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,760
- he's causing problems.
- Well, good to know

67
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,280
nothing's changed in five months.

68
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,400
Dad?

69
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,720
What's wrong?

70
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,800
Is everything okay?

71
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,240
No, baby.

72
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,240
You're starting to scare me.

73
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,360
Damien Darhk was in prison,
and he escaped,

74
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,520
and everyone tried to...

75
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,080
stop him.

76
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,800
But your sister, honey, she...

77
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,800
No, Dad. No.

78
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,000
- I'm sorry, baby.
- No, Dad.

79
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,080
No.

80
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,520
I got you.

81
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,680
You idiot. We're in the clear.

82
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,000
He was going after us.

83
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,120
{\an5}On foot. You shot him,
and wasted ammo.

84
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,200
Cops are coming.

85
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,320
You want to yell at me some more,

86
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,440
or should we both get out of here?

87
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,880
Neither.

88
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,280
Hey, Mick.

89
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,480
Oh, it... it's me.

90
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,320
It's Ray.

91
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,880
I... I thought we should talk.

92
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,280
Drive.

93
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,600
Well you didn't waste any time

94
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,000
getting back to your old habits.

95
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,280
I like stealing stuff.

96
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,600
It makes me feel good.

97
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,160
Did you ever think
that maybe you weren't meant

98
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,240
to do this anymore?

99
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,200
What do you want, haircut?

100
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,520
To apologize, sort of.

101
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,760
For Snart.

102
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,880
{\an5}I was the one who
was supposed to die,

103
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,960
{\an5}- and I can't help feeling that...
- It wasn't your fault.

104
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,720
It was his.

105
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,120
{\an5}Son of a bitch never did
anything without a plan.

106
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,600
Maybe you're right.

107
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,440
Maybe he wanted this.

108
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,800
What are you doing with your hand?

109
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,320
Maybe he wanted us to, you know,

110
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,320
be partners.

111
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,440
Think I'm going to be sick.

112
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,720
I think Snart knew.

113
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,600
{\an5}He knew that I'd keep
an eye out for you,

114
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,120
and you'd keep an eye out for me.

115
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,960
While doing what?

116
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,720
What we haven't finished doing.

117
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,560
What was H.G. Wells'
childhood nickname?

118
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,480
Bertie.

119
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,040
Incredible.

120
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,960
{\an5}You've gotten every answer
correct tonight.

121
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,040
{\an5}Since when did you become
such a history buff?

122
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,000
{\an5}I guess I developed
a passion for it recently.

123
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,000
During your sabbatical?

124
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,920
You hardly ever talk about it.

125
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,920
Martin?

126
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,960
I know, I'm sorry.

127
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,000
My sabbatical was...

128
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,640
{\an5}I left some very important
work unfinished.

129
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,000
Ship's not going to be here, Gray.

130
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,720
We saw it take off, remember?

131
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,920
Yes, and in doing so,

132
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,840
it would have left...

133
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,000
Quantum signature.

134
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,960
That's what I've been
trying to tell Mick.

135
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,400
Radio beacon.

136
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,520
Quantum entangler.

137
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,600
Boring.

138
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,000
{\an5}When do we get
in contact with Hunter?

139
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,720
Ms. Lance, are you all right?

140
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,960
{\an5}How do we get the Waverider
back here?

141
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,480
<i>Hi, Daddy, we miss you.
And love you.</i>

142
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,840
<i>And love you.</i>

143
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,640
<i>Captain, I'm sorry to interrupt.</i>

144
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,320
Tell me you've located Savage.

145
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,120
<i>No, but we have received
a transmission</i>

146
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,960
<i>from 2016 Star City.</i>

147
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,200
I don't understand.
This should have worked.

148
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,760
Did you account
for subspace interference?

149
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,320
It's the first thing I thought of.

150
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,960
Did you adjust
for temporal polarity?

151
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,280
Oh, Raymond, you insult me.

152
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,240
Can you reach
the Waverider or not?

153
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,560
We're working on it.

154
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,480
Actually, guys,
I think it just worked.

155
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,720
I thought I made my intentions
perfectly clear.

156
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,000
And we wish to be
equally clear about ours.

157
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,000
- Do you mind?
- Just checking to see

158
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,120
if you're real this time.

159
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,960
You're not ditching us again.

160
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,120
When the mission's over,

161
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,680
then we can all go our separate ways.

162
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,200
And this mission is not over.

163
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,320
Yeah, just curious
how much headway you've had

164
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,080
tracking Savage without all of us.

165
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,160
None.

166
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,360
But neither have I got myself

167
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,600
into bar fights
in 1975 and the Old West,

168
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,040
put dwarf star technology
into the hands of terrorists,

169
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,480
or got myself turned into
a scary bird monster.

170
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,680
We get your point.

171
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,880
Now get ours.

172
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,040
That ship's not taking off
without us.

173
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,920
You got that?

174
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,840
{\an5}- Halt!
- Oh, please don't shoot!

175
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,200
{\an5}- Don't shoot.
- What the hell are you doing

176
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,800
{\an5}- out here, lady?
- I was being held captive.

177
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,480
By Nazis?

178
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,160
No, worse.

179
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,360
- Your helmet.
- What about it?

180
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,520
I've seen it before.

181
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,720
Paper, do you have paper?
Something to write with.

182
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,400
- Lady, I think you're in shock.
- Please!

183
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,960
Yeah.

184
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,680
So, if it wasn't Nazis,
who were you running from?

185
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,760
I need your helmet.

186
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,920
Now!

187
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,200
I'm sorry, my love,

188
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,840
but this game is not over yet.

189
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,880
Despite my wishes
to pursue Savage alone,

190
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,280
it seems that you're all intent

191
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,200
on seeing this thing through
till the bitter...

192
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,080
Speaking of bitter.

193
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,480
You knew.

194
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,440
You dropped us off five months later

195
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,600
- because you knew.
- Knew what?

196
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,600
You knew that Laurel
was going to die,

197
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,080
and now you're going
to take me back,

198
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,840
and I'm going to save my sister.

199
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,600
- I'm afraid that that...
- You should be afraid.

200
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,720
I can't allow you...

201
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,800
I don't care about the timeline.

202
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,240
You're taking me back now.

203
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,520
Look, Sara, I'm sure there's
a valid reason why Rip didn't...

204
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,640
Stay out of this!

205
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,120
What the hell, Rip?

206
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,640
Mr. Rory, take Ms. Lance
to sleep it off.

207
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,040
Not to dismiss what just happened,

208
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,040
but we do have to find Savage,

209
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,120
assuming that Kendra and Carter
are still on his timeship.

210
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,800
He could...
Be anywhere in time and space.

211
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,760
Oh, well that narrows it down a lot.

212
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,600
Sorry.

213
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,960
Was this always over here?

214
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,040
No, it lives over...

215
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,800
Did you put it there?

216
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,880
Nah, man.

217
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,520
Did you?

218
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,400
Dude, it's just a helmet.

219
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,840
- Chronometric repositioning.
- What?

220
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,160
Temporal changes can, on occasion,

221
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,800
reverberate through the timeline,

222
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,960
physically moving an object

223
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,760
from one place to another.

224
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,240
- Gideon?
- <i>Yes, Captain.</i>

225
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,320
Plot a course
for Saint-Lo, France, 1944.

226
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,480
Why then?

227
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,960
Because that's where Kendra is.

228
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,520
How is that possible?

229
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,360
She sent us a message through time.

230
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,440
Go ahead, say it.

231
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,600
Astonishing.

232
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,720
I brought you some company.

233
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,640
Oh, he might be a little disoriented,

234
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,560
after the way he came out of stasis.

235
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,520
- I know you.
- Oh, you remember her?

236
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,840
Well, his mind isn't fully gone.

237
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,200
Hey! Stay away from him!

238
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,520
I'm going to kill you.

239
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,880
You've had 4,000 years to do so,
with no success.

240
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,920
What are you doing?

241
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,880
Your blood is the key to unlocking

242
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,560
the Thanagarian technology.

243
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,400
- Thanagarian?
- The alien species which gave

244
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,400
the three of us our powers.

245
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,520
They sent three meteorites

246
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,720
containing technology
beyond human understanding.

247
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,760
When they are activated
by your blood,

248
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,880
I will be able to erase time itself,

249
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,400
and travel us back to 1700 B.C.

250
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,120
- No. No!
- I will begin

251
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,880
my immortal life anew, only this time

252
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,200
I won't be content to whisper in
the ears of powerful men.

253
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,120
This time I will be the one
with the power.

254
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,320
I will be a god.

255
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,160
Please try very hard not to kill me.

256
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,920
Rip.

257
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,280
Please take me back.

258
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,720
I need your help.

259
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,720
I need to save my sister.

260
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,280
And you know that I would
do this for you, Sara,

261
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,440
but I just can't.

262
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,240
I've never asked you for anything.

263
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,520
And you, of all people,
should understand.

264
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,640
You have tried everything.

265
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,680
We... we have tried everything

266
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,760
to save your family.

267
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:47,120
And I would not wish the pain
of that failure upon anyone.

268
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,320
I would rather live
with that pain than this.

269
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,680
And that's just the thing, Sara.

270
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,880
Look, if you were able
to try to save Laurel,

271
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,520
then you wouldn't be alive at all.

272
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,080
Then, fine. I don't care.

273
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,640
When we left, when I recruited you,

274
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,720
we altered the timeline.

275
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,400
Now had it remained the same,
then Damien Darhk would have...

276
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,200
He would have killed
not only you and...

277
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,440
and your sister,

278
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,240
but your father as well.

279
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,880
But, Rip, if... if we go back,

280
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,200
and we take the team...

281
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,200
The outcome
would be exactly the same.

282
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,680
You don't know that.

283
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,280
- I'm afraid that I do.
- No.

284
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,360
I...

285
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,520
There's got to be a way.

286
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,160
Rip, I have to be
able to do something.

287
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,920
I'm so sorry.

288
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,680
Look, I can't.

289
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,960
Can't do this without my sister.

290
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,320
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

291
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,600
You are one of the strongest
people I have ever met, Sara.

292
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,360
Laurel... Laurel may be
beyond your saving,

293
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,240
but Kendra and Carter,

294
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,920
they might not be.

295
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,960
<i>Captain, we are prepared
to make the time jump to 1944.</i>

296
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,680
We're on our way, Gideon.

297
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,400
<i>We've arrived in Saint-Lo.</i>

298
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,600
<i>No sign of Kendra yet,
but I have located</i>

299
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,160
<i>Vandal Savage, and he does not
seem to be alone.</i>

300
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,240
Get them!

301
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,000
Keep Savage
and our Nazi friends occupied.

302
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,880
Gideon has detected
a temporal signature

303
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,000
consistent with a timeship.

304
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,600
If Kendra and Carter are alive,

305
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,000
<i>that is where they're going to be.</i>

306
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,200
Yeah, I see it.

307
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,080
- Jax.
- You miss me?

308
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,320
Is he still nuts?

309
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,680
No, he's okay.

310
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,640
Take this to the ship.

311
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,760
What the hell was that?

312
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,360
You transmuted the molecular
properties of the rifle.

313
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,000
What does that even mean?

314
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,400
Okay, let's get out of here.

315
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,680
Kendra's down.

316
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,240
Rip, we're kind of outnumbered here.

317
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,200
Fall back.
Staying here to fight Nazis

318
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,520
<i>is exacerbating the damage
that we have already</i>

319
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,760
done to the timeline.

320
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,840
- But Kendra...
<i>- Is alive,</i>

321
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,080
thankfully, and we will rescue her
in due course.

322
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,200
I hope.

323
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,040
So, this is a spaceship?

324
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,160
It's a timeship,

325
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,600
but yes, it does also travel
through space.

326
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,720
You... you've seen it before,
Mr. Hall.

327
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,200
That used to be my name.
Carter Hall.

328
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,760
There really is rather a lot
to fill you in on,

329
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,520
and we really do not have the time.

330
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,640
- What about...
- Kendra, yes,

331
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,920
we need your assistance
in locating her and Savage.

332
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,440
Perhaps we can start
with what Savage

333
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,400
was doing in 1944.

334
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,720
He said something about...

335
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,840
Thanagarian technology.

336
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,040
- Thanagarian...
- The Thanagarians

337
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,720
were a race of extraterrestrials.

338
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,800
He also said that this technology

339
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,800
was actually three meteors.

340
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,440
<i>Captain, I have surveillance footage
which might be relevant.</i>

341
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,560
Thank you, Gideon.

342
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,680
I've seen that rock before.

343
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,720
Savage had one of those in 1958.

344
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,840
He took our blood.
He said he would use it

345
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,040
in a ritual to erase time,

346
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,640
take the blood back to 1700 B.C.

347
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,240
- What are you doing?
- Come on, man.

348
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,320
We got to try it again.

349
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,040
That thing that
we did in World War II.

350
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,280
- It's called transmutation.
- Yeah.

351
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,600
It's a similar process by which

352
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,240
our uniform materializes
when we merge,

353
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,800
but at the moment, we need to focus

354
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,360
on figuring out what
Savage is planning.

355
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,920
Come on, just the once.

356
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,360
Is that Raymond
and Kendra's lucky vase?

357
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,240
I don't know, I just found
this junk lying around.

358
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,200
Oh, come on.

359
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,120
Don't you think that turning
something into something else

360
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,200
might come in handy?

361
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,320
All right, one time only.

362
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,400
Okay, just the once.

363
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,040
All right.

364
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,320
<i>You need to focus, Jefferson.</i>

365
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,720
<i>Why do you always say it
like I'm not focusing?</i>

366
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,800
<i>Just do what you did before.</i>

367
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,760
Oh, before we had a Nazi
trying to kill us.

368
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,240
This is just a vase.

369
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,200
Come on.

370
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,920
I never thought
I'd utter these words,

371
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,560
but I think we need a Nazi.

372
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,280
- Not funny.
- Look, the reason I keep

373
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,800
telling you to focus is because

374
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,640
transmutation is a literal
function of mind over matter.

375
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,840
Dude, this sucks.
Why do I always got to

376
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,680
- be in the driver's seat?
- Oh, don't despair, Jefferson.

377
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,600
This is only our second attempt

378
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,960
at transmutation, and, you know,

379
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,560
they always say,
"The third time's a charm."

380
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,120
What?

381
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,760
Third time. Three rituals.

382
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,000
I... I think I know
what Savage is planning to do.

383
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,200
I figured out how Savage
plans to erase time.

384
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,000
I believe he intends to detonate
each of these meteors

385
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,200
in a different time period.

386
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,920
How can you destroy the world

387
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,640
three times in three different times?

388
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,960
You can't, it would create
a temporal paradox.

389
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,400
Which would result in a time quake

390
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,880
that would return the Earth
to the point

391
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,080
of the first chronothermic reaction,

392
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,640
- Ancient Egypt.
- Okay, it's official.

393
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,400
This is the craziest bad guy plan

394
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,000
in the history of bad guy plans.

395
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,600
I don't think that sanity
is a yardstick

396
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,040
by which Vandal Savage
can be measured.

397
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,640
Okay, so which time periods
are we talking here?

398
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,000
You said Savage was in possession

399
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,680
of one of these meteorites in 1958.

400
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,480
That was a year of a rare alignment,

401
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,120
with the Earth and Thanagar.

402
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,560
Evidently he got hold
of a second meteorite in 1944.

403
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,520
Which would be
useless to him in a year

404
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,280
where Earth and Thanagar
weren't in alignment.

405
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,360
Now, if my math is correct,
and trust me, it is,

406
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,960
the next two years
that Earth and Thanagar

407
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:05,360
are in sync are 1975 and 2021.

408
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,960
But Savage still has to do this

409
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,200
in three different time periods.

410
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:12,520
That's the beauty of
immortality, Jefferson he can.

411
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,040
{\an5}He can literally be
in three places at once.

412
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,520
Can't be.

413
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,160
Can.

414
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,960
Thanks to time travel,
and it's because of time travel

415
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,400
that I know you're here.

416
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,560
You're out here tonight,
because you have felt

417
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,200
an imminent presence of...

418
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,320
something.

419
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,520
A meteorite?

420
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,560
And I'm going to give you a use
for it which will give us the power

421
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,320
to rewrite destiny itself.

422
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,200
Change the course
of the entire world.

423
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,920
So, if Savage plans on blowing
up the world three times,

424
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,040
- how do we stop him?
- We don't.

425
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,480
- We kill him.
- How?

426
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,880
We've always known that only you

427
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,200
or Kendra could kill Savage

428
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,720
using items exposed, as you were,

429
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,120
to the meteor's radiation.

430
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,600
Now, the radiation works both ways.

431
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,360
It gave Savage his immortality,
but...

432
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,320
It also makes him vulnerable.

433
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,120
And Savage is about to unleash

434
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,200
the radiation from three meteorites

435
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,360
in three different time periods.

436
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,480
- Triple the exposure.
- Yes.

437
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:38,000
Which should be sufficient
to render Savage mortal.

438
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,160
And then all we got to do
is kill Savage three times.

439
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,240
Indeed.

440
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,920
Gideon can navigate the Waverider,
and we can split

441
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,120
into teams of two.

442
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,000
One in 1958, one in 1975,

443
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,120
and one in 2021.

444
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,600
Open it.

445
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,840
Did you know that this is one
of the original meteorites

446
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,560
which fell upon the Middle Kingdom?

447
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,480
Drawn from the ground
after a millennia,

448
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,960
straight into Nazi hands.

449
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,960
The object that has bound
the two of us together

450
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,960
for 4,000 years has the power

451
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,920
to take us back
to where it all began.

452
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,760
But this time,
I will be the pharaoh,

453
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,640
- and you...
- Will hate you,

454
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,840
like I've always hated you.

455
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,880
Patience, Mr. Hall.

456
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,840
All our teams need to act
simultaneously.

457
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,200
I think that's a comet or something.

458
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,720
It's a meteorite, in point of fact.

459
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,480
I was drawn to it as well.

460
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,400
When can I kill him?

461
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,000
We have to wait
for the meteor to go critical.

462
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,160
When's that?

463
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,760
When he starts the ritual
in all three time periods.

464
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,880
{\an5}We got a nuclear bomb, here.

465
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,640
Professor, Jax, we need you.

466
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,160
Oh, man, I forgot how much
of a badass I was.

467
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,080
Look.

468
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,640
What do you mean
you don't have the money?

469
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,520
I was going to sell
a nuclear warhead

470
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,440
and pay you out of the profit.

471
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,240
- Things changed.
- You expect me

472
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,000
to just hand
the meteor over for free?

473
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,920
No, I expected
to take it from you by force.

474
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,760
Well...

475
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,520
I think that's our cue.

476
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,400
Really? These guys again?

477
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,320
Now.

478
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,280
Keep them occupied.

479
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,280
You ready to show these fools
what's really good?

480
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,680
You have no idea.

481
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,520
Glad we're past the point
of worrying about the timeline.

482
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,320
Carter!

483
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,720
Oh, you're too late.

484
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,080
Time Master's never late.

485
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,640
Rip!

486
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,160
You can't kill me.

487
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,680
I'm immortal.

488
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,480
Guess you haven't heard the news.

489
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,520
Good-bye, my love.

490
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,600
Oh, you can feel it, can't you?

491
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,040
Things are different this time.

492
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,200
You're mortal.

493
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,320
But yet, my death

494
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,560
does not save the lives
of your family.

495
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,960
I may die, but you'll live

496
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,240
knowing that you failed
to save the lives of...

497
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,760
Never speak their names again.

498
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,400
Do something, Robocop.

499
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,720
- I'm on it.
- Got a little trick

500
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,800
I've been working on.

501
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,280
It's up to you now, Jefferson.

502
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,800
Gray, listen.
If we're going to do this,

503
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,000
we got to do it together.

504
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,840
It's going to take
the two of us, all right?

505
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,960
<i>- You're right.</i>
- Okay.

506
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,640
Come on, Gray!

507
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,720
Oh, man. You got my boots wet.

508
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,040
<i>Jefferson, you did it!</i>

509
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,120
We did it, man.

510
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,600
Gideon, take us back to Rip.

511
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,920
Damn it!

512
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,480
I wanted to be the one to kill him.

513
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,360
Again, I mean.

514
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,440
I don't think
our problems are over yet.

515
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,400
I'm on it.

516
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,960
On what?

517
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,920
It's not working.

518
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,640
<i>The radiation buildup
is too progressive.</i>

519
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,720
I got this.

520
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,720
I don't understand.
I must be all out of power.

521
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,720
What happens if only one
of these goes off?

522
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,240
Oh, time will remain intact.

523
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,960
The world?

524
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,000
Not so much.

525
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,080
Okay, guys, let's fly
this thing out of here.

526
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,640
To where? We would never
get it far enough away.

527
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,480
Maybe the Waverider can.

528
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,600
Rip, we need...

529
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,680
Rip?

530
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,920
Rip! What are you doing?

531
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,280
I'm flying the Waverider
into the sun,

532
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,920
with the meteor on board.

533
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,120
<i>And you on it.</i>

534
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,560
I guess this is good-bye.

535
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,360
It's been a pleasure, Captain.

536
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,640
Likewise, Dr. Palmer.

537
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,640
<i>But you brought us
all into this, man.</i>

538
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,200
Which is why I'm doing this
alone, Mr. Jackson.

539
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,720
I'll have no one else
die for my choices.

540
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,560
This isn't going to bring Snart back.

541
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,960
I don't want to lose another friend.

542
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,640
I appreciate that, Mr. Rory.

543
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,720
<i>I must say, it's been an honor
to serve as your cap...</i>

544
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,800
<i>Rip.</i>

545
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,560
<i>Daddy?</i>

546
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,680
Miranda.

547
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,360
I...

548
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,600
Where...

549
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,000
<i>I'm still here, Captain.</i>

550
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,360
I know you are, Gideon.

551
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,840
<i>May I share something with you?</i>

552
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,320
<i>I'm not ready to die.</i>

553
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,800
Me neither.

554
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,760
Which reminds me...

555
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,400
Is our solar ray still functional?

556
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,360
<i>In fact, it's operating at an
efficiency rate of 12,000 percent.</i>

557
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,480
Transfer all available power
to the time drive.

558
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,800
Get ready to eject the meteor,

559
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:45,400
and pray that we have enough
power for one last jump.

560
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,320
What happens if only one
of these goes off?

561
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,880
Our time will remain intact.

562
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,920
The world, not so much.

563
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,120
Okay, guys, let's fly
this thing out of here.

564
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,200
To where? We'd never get it
far enough away.

565
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,520
Maybe the Waverider can.

566
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,280
Rip, we need where's Rip?

567
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,640
And the meteorite?

568
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,360
Will somebody please tell me
what just happened?

569
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,560
Rip?

570
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,000
Sorry if I gave you all a fright.

571
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,520
What happened to the meteor?

572
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,960
Oh, I flew it into
the heart of the sun.

573
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,920
Well, I angled the ship
to eject the meteorite

574
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,280
before impact, and then...

575
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,320
time jumped away.

576
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,560
You could have been killed.

577
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,680
Should have been.

578
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,760
You're a moron.

579
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,400
Now, who fancies
a return trip to 2016?

580
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,000
I can't believe it's over.

581
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,360
Well, for some of you, yes.

582
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,200
My journey, it seems,
is only just beginning.

583
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,480
How does that work?

584
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,200
Savage is three times dead.

585
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,240
The Time Masters are no longer
of growing concern,

586
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,920
due to our destruction of the Oculus.

587
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,080
Someone needs to be responsible
for protecting the timeline.

588
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,560
Who better than
a former Time Master?

589
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,200
And any of you who'd like to join me.

590
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,600
I should stay
and help you with Darhk.

591
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,600
And get justice for Laurel.

592
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,520
That's happening, honey,
with or without you.

593
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,920
I promise.

594
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,200
Oh, listen, I... I can't pretend

595
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,920
to understand this time travel thing,

596
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,480
but it sounds important.

597
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,520
So is family.

598
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,520
I wasn't going to go the first time.

599
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,280
Then Laurel convinced me.

600
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,040
And now I'm going to do this for her.

601
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,480
Well, she'd be proud of you.

602
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,200
How do you know?

603
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,880
'Cause I am.

604
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,760
What German lone word
literally means

605
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,960
"the desire to hike"?

606
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,840
Wanderlust.

607
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,480
A word which could also be used

608
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,440
to describe that look in your eye.

609
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,840
- What look in my eye?
- Martin, we've been married

610
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:38,000
for 28 years,
and you're still a lousy liar.

611
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,120
Now about this new sabbatical.

612
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,560
I decided to decline the invitation.

613
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,840
But... I think you should.

614
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,600
I... I think... I think
it's important...

615
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,360
Clarissa, I'm not leaving you.
That's final.

616
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,720
Hey, Gray. What are you...

617
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,640
I'm so glad
that you could make it, Jax.

618
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,880
What are you up to?

619
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,800
Well, we had a nice, long talk

620
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,160
- this afternoon, didn't we?
- Yeah.

621
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,680
Oh, my God, this is an intervention!

622
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,760
Yeah, you could kind of call it that.

623
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,760
Listen, Gray, you're meant for more

624
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:13,280
than sitting around answering
trivia questions about history.

625
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,920
Me, you, Firestorm.

626
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,320
We're made for changing history.

627
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,600
- This is my life.
- And your life

628
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,880
will be waiting for you
when you get back.

629
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,200
You really want me to do this?

630
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,800
I could never forgive myself
if I kept you from it,

631
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,080
my husband the superhero.

632
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,480
Why are you looking at me like that?

633
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,080
Wasn't sure you'd make it.

634
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,240
You left me a message, I came.

635
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,680
What of it?

636
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,480
I just wanted to talk.

637
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,560
You and I,
we've done a lot of thieving,

638
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,600
a lot of cool stuff, a lot of fun.

639
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,160
Anyway, I...

640
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,480
I just wanted to make sure
I said something important that

641
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,920
wasn't left unsaid.

642
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,920
Mick, I don't do touchy-feely.

643
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,160
If you got something to say, say it.

644
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,960
This wasn't a good idea.

645
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,880
You're the best guy I ever knew.

646
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,200
You may not think you're a hero,

647
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,280
but you're a hero to me.

648
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,680
You got that?

649
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,720
Yeah, I got it.

650
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,960
See you around.

651
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,440
You okay?

652
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,920
Fine.

653
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,120
So, did you tell him?

654
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,680
That he killed himself
to save our destinies?

655
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,640
If it's any consolation,

656
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,720
I can always bring you back

657
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,240
to this particular time and place.

658
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,320
I'm fine.

659
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Just let it be.

660
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,960
A full compliment.

661
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,080
To be honest, I had my doubts
that all of you would be willing

662
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,760
to throw in with me for a second go.

663
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,920
- Well, actually...
- We're not coming with you.

664
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,920
With Savage gone,
we want to start fresh,

665
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,080
see what happens.

666
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,880
I give it three months, tops.

667
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,120
Look, I just...

668
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,760
I want to say thank you.

669
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,440
To all of you.

670
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,440
- Ray, I...
- No.

671
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,320
This is...

672
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,640
it's meant to be.

673
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,520
I wish both of you nothing
but the best.

674
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:27,920
Be safe.

675
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,480
See you guys around.

676
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,960
Every time they do that,

677
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,360
I get hungry for chicken.

678
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,120
So, shall we?

679
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,720
- Is that...
- The Waverider.

680
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,800
Another Waverider?

681
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,400
Whatever it is,
it's not slowing down.

682
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,160
Get down!

683
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,280
What the hell's going on?

684
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:13,760
To be honest, Mr. Jackson,
I have absolutely no idea.

685
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,720
Is this 2016?

686
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,520
Is this May 2016?

687
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,720
Yeah.

688
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,000
You're exactly
where you said you'd be.

689
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,000
Do not get on that ship.

690
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,160
If you do, you're all dead.

691
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,120
Says who?

692
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,520
Says you, Mr. Rory.

693
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,360
You sent me.

694
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,200
I'm sorry.

695
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,280
Who exactly are you?

696
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,840
My name is Rex Tyler.

697
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,000
I'm a member of the
Justice Society of America.
