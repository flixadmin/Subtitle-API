00:00:01,267 --> 00:00:06,067
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:07,973
When I was a child,
I saw my mother killed

4
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:08,975
By something impossible.

5
00:00:09,076 --> 00:00:10,336
Run, Barry.
Run.

6
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:13,144
My father went to prison
for her murder.

7
00:00:13,147 --> 00:00:17,082
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

8
00:00:17,084 --> 00:00:19,785
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensics scientist,

9
00:00:19,787 --> 00:00:21,787
But secretly, I use my speed

10
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:24,490
To fight crime
and find others like me.

11
00:00:24,492 --> 00:00:26,826
And one day, I'll find
who killed my mother.

12
00:00:26,828 --> 00:00:29,395
- Mom.
- And get justice for my father.

13
00:00:29,397 --> 00:00:31,263
I am the Flash.

14
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:33,999
Previously, on <i>the Flash...</i>

15
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:35,734
Who do you think you are?

16
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:38,337
This is what we talked about,
using my speed to do good.

17
00:00:38,339 --> 00:00:41,106
We talked about you helping
us contain other meta-humans.

18
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:43,442
After all of these journalism
classes, I started a blog.

19
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:44,577
I thought you were taking
journalism,

20
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:46,011
Not science fiction writing.

21
00:00:46,013 --> 00:00:47,346
Ever since I have known you,

22
00:00:47,348 --> 00:00:49,148
You have believed
in the impossible.

23
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,916
What if you were right about
the night that your mom died?

24
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:53,519
Something out there
is saving people.

25
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,591
See you soon, Barry.

26
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,561
How often do you think about

27
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,296
Why your friends came
into your life?

28
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:08,300
Was it random, by design,
or maybe a little of both?

29
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:11,036
Nice.

30
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:14,306
Regardless of the reason,
some friends you just know

31
00:01:14,308 --> 00:01:17,309
Are gonna be by your side
for a while.

32
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:20,579
Others, you're not so sure.

33
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:24,383
And then there's that one
friend who, well, you hope,

34
00:01:24,385 --> 00:01:28,387
Someday becomes something more.

35
00:01:28,389 --> 00:01:31,357
But "friend"
will have to do for now.

36
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:33,459
And that's okay.

37
00:01:33,461 --> 00:01:35,361
I guess.

38
00:01:35,363 --> 00:01:37,663
I'm glad
you invited Caitlin and Cisco.

39
00:01:37,665 --> 00:01:38,797
They're cool, right?

40
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,499
They saved your life, Barry.

41
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:42,668
That makes them the coolest
people I've ever met.

42
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,304
It's nice
that you guys became friends.

43
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:49,508
To friends, old and new.

44
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:55,314
Ooh.
I'm up.

45
00:01:55,316 --> 00:01:59,184
Wish me luck.

46
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:00,953
I'm going to destroy you.

47
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:02,955
Don't get cocky, West.

48
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,296
Guys?
I have a problem.

49
00:02:10,298 --> 00:02:13,232
We all do when guys
like him exist.

50
00:02:13,234 --> 00:02:15,868
Yeah, he's so hot.

51
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,470
Uh, I mean,
genetically speaking.

52
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,306
Because I'm a geneticist,
of course.

53
00:02:20,308 --> 00:02:21,707
Oh, my god,
do I sound like Felicity?

54
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:23,275
I'm not talking about Eddie.

55
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:27,546
I'm talking about this.

56
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:29,381
I can't feel anything.

57
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:32,718
Yeah, that's usually what
happens when you drink too much.

58
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,954
No, the alcohol
is not affecting me.

59
00:02:34,956 --> 00:02:37,189
I mean I literally feel nothing.

60
00:02:37,191 --> 00:02:39,425
It's your hypermetabolism.
I need a sample.

61
00:02:39,427 --> 00:02:40,626
I'll get more shots.

62
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:42,594
I swear,
I had a vacutainer here.

63
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:44,463
Wait, you carry a blood
collection kit in your purse?

64
00:02:44,465 --> 00:02:46,432
You have your hobbies.

65
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:59,078
- 14th floor is secure.
- Roger that.

66
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,421
Hold off on that check.

67
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,364
Lock down the building!

68
00:03:18,366 --> 00:03:20,966
Hold it!

69
00:03:20,968 --> 00:03:22,201
Don't come near me.

70
00:03:22,203 --> 00:03:26,672
You need to come with me.
Come on.

71
00:03:26,674 --> 00:03:28,273
Get down!

72
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,861
- Still nothing?
- I can't get drunk.

73
00:03:48,863 --> 00:03:50,295
I mean, I'm only 25,

74
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:51,663
And my drinking days
are already over.

75
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:52,998
Come on, Allen.
You're up.

76
00:03:56,137 --> 00:03:58,504
There was a bombing
on 8th and pass.

77
00:03:58,506 --> 00:04:00,439
I got to go, babe.
Okay.

78
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:02,274
Sorry, guys.

79
00:04:02,276 --> 00:04:04,243
I've got an early shift
at jitters.

80
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:06,178
Barry, we'll catch up tomorrow.

81
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,947
It's getting late, anyway,
so I'm just gonna...

82
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:18,424
Help! Help!

83
00:04:18,426 --> 00:04:20,325
Somebody!

84
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:22,861
Guys, there's a window washer,
and he's gonna fall.

85
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:23,996
Don't try and catch him.

86
00:04:23,998 --> 00:04:25,564
You don't have super strength.

87
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:27,232
Well, is there,
like, a bed store near here?

88
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:29,201
What if I get a bunch
of mattresses and stack them?

89
00:04:29,203 --> 00:04:31,570
Barry,
this isn't a roadrunner cartoon.

90
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:33,372
Help! Help!

91
00:04:33,374 --> 00:04:36,075
How fast would I need to go to
run up the side of a building?

92
00:04:36,077 --> 00:04:38,577
How far up do you need to go?

93
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:41,880
Hurry, somebody!

94
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:43,916
I don't know.
50 meters, give or take.

95
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:46,418
32.56...

96
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:51,490
- Guys, hurry!
- Help!

97
00:04:51,492 --> 00:04:53,425
Just run really fast
and you'll be fine.

98
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:56,428
But you need to maintain your
velocity on the way down, or...

99
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,697
Or what?

100
00:04:58,699 --> 00:04:59,898
Splat.

101
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,667
- Great.
- Help!

102
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:05,904
All right.
All right, all right, all right.

103
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:09,007
Here goes.

104
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,480
Barry?
What do you got?

105
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:52,317
Bombers typically have
their own unique signatures.

106
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:54,486
Crimped wires, fragmentation.

107
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:57,789
The level of sophistication is
telling once I've analyzed it.

108
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:00,292
You show me a bomb,
I can usually find a clue in it.

109
00:06:00,294 --> 00:06:01,994
It sounds like
there's a "but" coming.

110
00:06:01,996 --> 00:06:04,530
Yeah, I haven't found any sign
of an oxidizing agent.

111
00:06:04,532 --> 00:06:06,465
It's as if the floor
just blew itself up.

112
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:08,066
Things don't just blow up.

113
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:11,570
Security guard said our bomber
was a woman, red hair.

114
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:13,505
Must've cut
the security camera's feed.

115
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:16,575
There's no footage, but
there might be something else.

116
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:20,812
Some kind of small charge
blasted the doorknob off.

117
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,182
Any idea what's missing?

118
00:06:23,184 --> 00:06:24,917
My guess is one
of these files.

119
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:27,152
It's gonna take days
to figure out which one.

120
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:31,823
Let's let Barry do his thing.

121
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:59,084
- What's going on?
- I have no idea.

122
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,153
But they came in here
like they own the place.

123
00:07:01,155 --> 00:07:04,223
Been talking to Singh
for the last half hour.

124
00:07:04,225 --> 00:07:06,024
This can't be good.

125
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:14,032
General Eiling,
this is Detective West.

126
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:16,802
Detective.

127
00:07:16,804 --> 00:07:18,470
What's this all about?

128
00:07:18,472 --> 00:07:21,406
The army's taking over
the bombing investigation.

129
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:23,108
I'll need everything you have.

130
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,043
Physical evidence,
photographs, witness interviews,

131
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:26,411
And all your personal notes.

132
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:28,146
I've been on the job
nearly 20 years

133
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:30,282
And never heard of the army
investigating anything civilian.

134
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:34,953
Well, it's not civilian.
She's one of ours.

135
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,588
We'll send over
everything we got.

136
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,423
Very kind of you.

137
00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:42,427
I think we'll take it now,
though.

138
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:46,064
Give them what they want, Joe.

139
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:49,401
You heard him, Joe.
Give me what I want.

140
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:02,047
Hey, what's going on?

141
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:04,883
General Eiling is relieving us
from the bombing case.

142
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:09,354
Give these men everything
that's relevant.

143
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:11,089
Sure thing, yeah.

144
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,631
You and a few civilians
from S.T.A.R. Labs

145
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:21,800
Might want to check into that.

146
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:23,535
I think we might.

147
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:25,871
Can I talk to you for
a minute, Joe?

148
00:08:25,873 --> 00:08:27,472
It's about Iris.

149
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:30,676
Hey, dad.
You're home early.

150
00:08:30,678 --> 00:08:33,645
What were you doing
at the bomb site last night?

151
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:37,482
Don't deny you were there.
Officer Vukuvich saw you.

152
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:39,785
It's... complicated.

153
00:08:39,787 --> 00:08:41,687
You can't be coming
to every crime scene

154
00:08:41,689 --> 00:08:42,754
Because you're worried
about Eddie.

155
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:44,122
He's a big boy, Iris.

156
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:45,691
I didn't go there
to see Eddie.

157
00:08:45,693 --> 00:08:49,194
I went there to see the streak.

158
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:57,169
The streak.
Hmm, why is that?

159
00:08:57,171 --> 00:08:58,537
My blog.

160
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:00,138
I've been collecting
internet posts

161
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:04,543
About the streak sightings,
and writing about them.

162
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:06,244
Baby, there's no streak.

163
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:07,846
Yes, there is.

164
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:11,116
I saw him last night, dad.
I looked right at him.

165
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:13,685
Something incredible
is happening in Central City.

166
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:15,320
And I am gonna write about it.

167
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:17,255
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to get to work.

168
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:22,761
Blogging about supernatural
events doesn't really pay well.

169
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:31,269
A VA file number is all
the info you have on the bomber?

170
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:33,205
CCPD's been ordered
off the case.

171
00:09:33,207 --> 00:09:34,673
Well, who has the power
to do that?

172
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:37,342
The army.
Some general.

173
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:39,344
His name was Eiling, I think.

174
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:41,179
General Wade Eiling.

175
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:43,382
- You know him?
- Yeah, I know him.

176
00:09:43,384 --> 00:09:45,283
About ten years ago,
General Wade Eiling

177
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:46,952
Contracted S.T.A.R. Labs
to develop

178
00:09:46,954 --> 00:09:48,987
enhanced gene therapies
for soldiers.

179
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:50,188
I was interested
in the potential

180
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,023
medical benefits for civilians.

181
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:54,159
General Eiling really wanted
to develop

182
00:09:54,161 --> 00:09:57,696
Mind reading capabilities
for interrogation purposes.

183
00:09:57,698 --> 00:09:59,765
I stopped the study when I
saw his techniques up close,

184
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:02,367
But our split
was less than amicable.

185
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:04,736
He took all the evidence
I collected on the bombing.

186
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:06,905
Everything but the folder.

187
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:09,741
Well... lucky for us,
the VA finally

188
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:13,345
Joined the new millennium
and digitized their records.

189
00:10:13,347 --> 00:10:14,946
A lot of redacted info.

190
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,516
But our girl's name
is Bette Sans Souci,

191
00:10:17,518 --> 00:10:19,518
An EOD specialist for the army.

192
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,353
- EOD?
- Bombs.

193
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:22,487
Is there an address?

194
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:23,755
Hold on.
Here, we go.

195
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:25,857
One person in case of emergency.

196
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:28,860
Cameron Scott.
Inglewood.

197
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:51,883
Bette Sans Souci?

198
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:52,918
I need you to come with me.

199
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,221
Don't touch me.

200
00:10:56,223 --> 00:10:57,923
Get whatever you're wearing
off of you.

201
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:01,059
Hurry.

202
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:16,775
Barry, can you hear me?
Barry?

203
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:18,610
There must be a perfectly
reasonable explanation

204
00:11:18,612 --> 00:11:20,812
For why he's not answering.

205
00:11:20,814 --> 00:11:24,349
Barry?

206
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:25,584
Uh...

207
00:11:25,586 --> 00:11:28,086
Don't ask.

208
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:31,089
I'm gonna ask.
Where's my suit?

209
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:34,559
It's... Gone.

210
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:36,161
What do you mean, it's gone?

211
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:37,562
What did you do with my suit?

212
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:39,231
It blew up, dude.

213
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:42,467
I managed to get out of it
before it went, "kaboom."

214
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:44,970
My suit went "kaboom"?

215
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:46,838
Fun fact about
Bette Sans Souci.

216
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,173
She's not carrying bombs.

217
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:49,674
She touched the emblem
on the suit

218
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:52,143
And turned it into a bomb.

219
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:53,678
She's a meta-human.

220
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,947
With the ability
to cause spontaneous combustion

221
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:58,450
Upon tactile contact.

222
00:11:58,452 --> 00:12:00,619
- She blew up my suit.
- You have, like, three more.

223
00:12:00,621 --> 00:12:03,522
Okay, I have two.
And I loved that one.

224
00:12:03,524 --> 00:12:05,123
All right,
what else do we know about her?

225
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,859
Oh, I don't know.
She's pure evil.

226
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:09,327
We're gonna find this girl

227
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:11,830
And send her butt
into the pipeline.

228
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:13,498
No one blows my tech
to smithereens

229
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,968
And gets away with it...

230
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:20,906
Unless she looks like that.

231
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:22,574
I don't think
she meant to hurt me.

232
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:24,042
Well, her being a meta-human

233
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:26,978
Explains General Eiling's
interest in her.

234
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,548
And why he stole the case
from us.

235
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:33,818
He didn't want anyone
to know what she could do.

236
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,220
- Detective.
- Doctor.

237
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:38,290
So... Human bomb.

238
00:12:38,292 --> 00:12:39,858
Must be Tuesday in Central City.

239
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,793
Yes, and General Eiling's

240
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:44,963
Not one to give up a potential
asset without a fight.

241
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:46,731
We have to find her
before he does.

242
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:49,634
Barry?
Can I see you for a second?

243
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,242
When were you planning
on telling me

244
00:12:57,244 --> 00:12:58,910
That Iris saw the streak?

245
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:01,079
That was not planned.
She caught me off guard.

246
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:02,948
We had a deal.

247
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,649
You keep her in the dark
about the meta-humans,

248
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:06,885
And I don't go Floyd Mayweather
on you.

249
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:08,153
Okay, Joe, I know.

250
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:10,055
And she's writing a blog now.

251
00:13:10,057 --> 00:13:11,456
I already talked to her
about that.

252
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:14,626
Talk to her again.
And be more convincing.

253
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:19,364
Okay.

254
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:21,066
- You mean, right now?
- Yes, I do.

255
00:13:21,068 --> 00:13:23,134
All right.

256
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,537
You've got
to stop writing about this guy.

257
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:27,539
He doesn't even exist.
I saw him, Barry.

258
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,908
He wears a red suit,
like, a uniform or something,

259
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:32,544
with a lightning bolt
on his chest.

260
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:33,945
I mean, Iris, come on.

261
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:36,214
You were drinking last night
at the bar.

262
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:38,783
I was not drunk,
and I know what I saw.

263
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:40,752
He wears a mask.

264
00:13:40,754 --> 00:13:44,389
I think he smiled at me.

265
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:47,092
Okay, first of all,
if he is wearing a mask,

266
00:13:47,094 --> 00:13:49,227
That probably means he doesn't
want people to know who he is.

267
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:51,029
It doesn't matter who he is.

268
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:54,799
What matters is that people
know that he's out there.

269
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:56,935
What is wrong with you?
This is important to me.

270
00:13:56,937 --> 00:13:59,604
Why can't you be more
supportive?

271
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:02,874
I'm just... you haven't even
put your name on it.

272
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:07,212
How serious can you be
about an anonymous blog?

273
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:10,982
Okay, you know what?
Our entire lives,

274
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:13,652
You couldn't scream loud enough
that the impossible existed.

275
00:14:13,654 --> 00:14:16,154
And now it's actually happening
in Central City.

276
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:19,524
I have proof of it, and you
don't want to know about it?

277
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:21,760
That doesn't make sense, Barry.

278
00:14:21,762 --> 00:14:23,461
So when you're ready to tell me
what this whole routine

279
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:27,032
Is really about, then we can
talk.

280
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:31,803
Yeah.

281
00:14:31,805 --> 00:14:33,772
We've piggybacked onto General
Eiling's own surveillance.

282
00:14:33,774 --> 00:14:35,507
According to what they're
saying,

283
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:39,044
The lovely Ms. Sans Souci
was just spotted in Inglewood.

284
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:41,880
The same neighborhood
as Dr. Harold Hadley's office,

285
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:43,181
The military surgeon
who performed

286
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:44,683
Several procedures on her.

287
00:14:44,685 --> 00:14:46,217
That's why she was looking
for the folder.

288
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,453
You got to get to her
before Eiling does.

289
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:49,721
Okay.

290
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:06,738
- Sgt. Sans Souci.
- You remember me.

291
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:10,408
Good.
Because I remember you, doctor.

292
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,210
I remember waking up
from a coma.

293
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:13,778
You started cutting me open.

294
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,681
I was only trying
to help ease your condition.

295
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:18,049
You couldn't control it.

296
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:21,686
You did this to me.
You and Eiling.

297
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,172
Go bring me my asset.

298
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,713
You okay?

299
00:15:48,715 --> 00:15:50,281
Look, I can get you out of here.

300
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,716
I can help you understand
what happened to you.

301
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:54,052
- How?
- Because it happened to me too.

302
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:55,854
Please.

303
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:12,637
Target is gone.

304
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:22,113
As the detonation dispersed
throughout Central City,

305
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:23,948
A number of people were exposed
to a wave

306
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,316
Of unquantifiable energy.

307
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:28,119
One of those people... was you.

308
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:31,022
You were in Central City
ten months ago.

309
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:35,627
I had just returned
from Afghanistan.

310
00:16:35,629 --> 00:16:37,061
I was there
defusing roadside bombs

311
00:16:37,063 --> 00:16:41,733
And... shrapnel ripped
through me.

312
00:16:41,735 --> 00:16:43,134
I was flown back state side.

313
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:44,769
Spent months
at the base recuperating

314
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:48,306
And next thing I know,

315
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:50,975
I became the thing that almost
killed me.

316
00:16:50,977 --> 00:16:54,312
And Eiling's favorite,
new lab rat.

317
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:55,814
The dark matter must have
combined

318
00:16:55,816 --> 00:16:59,117
With the bomb particulate
inside your body.

319
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:01,786
I thought Eiling
did this to me.

320
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:06,724
Eiling is not smart enough
to create someone like you.

321
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:08,960
Clever enough to see your value.

322
00:17:08,962 --> 00:17:11,863
Do you know of any others
who were changed?

323
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:13,364
There've been a few.

324
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:18,503
But no one
that looks like you.

325
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:22,674
I'm sorry.
That was inappropriate.

326
00:17:22,676 --> 00:17:24,008
Please don't leave.

327
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,978
I know how to perform
a lobotomy.

328
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,147
Her cellular structure's
unlike anything I've ever seen.

329
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:32,650
Her nitrogen levels
are off the charts.

330
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,455
Do you think we can help her?

331
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:38,723
To answer that question,
we have to understand

332
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:40,458
How she works,
and to understand that,

333
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,327
First we have to study her
in action.

334
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:44,295
You want her to blow stuff up.

335
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:46,164
Yes, now we're talking.
Not in here.

336
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,166
She's too unstable.
I know.

337
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:49,534
I know you know.

338
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:51,169
So this is your life now, huh?

339
00:17:51,171 --> 00:17:53,504
Testing people like me?

340
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:56,241
Stopping people like you.

341
00:17:56,243 --> 00:18:00,245
It's not what I thought
I'd be doing.

342
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:01,980
Actually, aside from Barry,

343
00:18:01,982 --> 00:18:04,649
You're the first meta-human
that we've tested.

344
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:09,587
- "Meta-human"?
- It's just a term.

345
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:13,091
Oh, my god, what happened?

346
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:15,193
Why didn't you say
that you were shot?

347
00:18:15,195 --> 00:18:17,528
It just grazed me.

348
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:20,064
There's something in there.

349
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:29,274
A tracker.

350
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,246
Lock down the pipeline.
Get Bette out of here.

351
00:18:35,248 --> 00:18:37,415
I'll take care of Eiling.

352
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:46,791
Harrison Wells.
How the mighty have fallen.

353
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:48,359
General.

354
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:51,429
S.T.A.R. Labs.

355
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:54,599
This place used to be
so important.

356
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:55,967
Tell me, what does one do

357
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:58,469
After such a spectacular,
public failure?

358
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:02,540
One adapts.
One evolves.

359
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:05,043
One becomes intent
on reversing one's fortune.

360
00:19:05,045 --> 00:19:07,445
Always the idealist.

361
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:10,315
- What do you want, Wade?
- Where's my asset?

362
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:11,983
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

363
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:13,785
We tracked her here, Harrison.

364
00:19:13,787 --> 00:19:15,386
Turn her over to me
before you see the rest

365
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:16,988
Of your precious palace crumble.

366
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:20,558
Oh, Wade, Wade, Wade.

367
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:28,533
We could've changed
the world, you and I.

368
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,947
427 kPa's.

369
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:45,049
Her Trauzl rating is around 45.

370
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:47,381
That's the same
as any plastique.

371
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:50,387
Plastique.
Ha... first try!

372
00:19:50,457 --> 00:19:53,257
Didn't really think
this one through, did you?

373
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:59,864
Downrange, insurgents
started booby trapping cars.

374
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,499
The rest of my tour,
I was terrified

375
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:05,303
to touch another vehicle.

376
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:06,935
Now, I'm gonna spend the rest

377
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,940
of my life terrified
to touch another human being.

378
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,700
Have they tried to help you?

379
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:20,551
Yeah, they've helped me learn
how to use my powers.

380
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,387
Not reverse them.

381
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:26,824
If they could reverse it
so you weren't a meta-human,

382
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:30,094
Would you?

383
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:34,098
A friend told me I was
given my speed for a reason.

384
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,702
That I was chosen.

385
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:39,303
I don't know if I believe that,

386
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:43,508
But I always wanted
to help people.

387
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,443
Now I can.

388
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:51,716
Sorry.
Hey, Joe.

389
00:20:51,718 --> 00:20:55,053
I see your little conversation
with Iris was a rousing success.

390
00:20:55,055 --> 00:20:58,089
She just posted another story
about the streak.

391
00:20:58,091 --> 00:20:59,924
Joe, I tried.
I really tried.

392
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:01,859
She's got her name on it now,
Barry.

393
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:03,828
What?
Joe...

394
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,663
It's my fault, I shouldn't
have asked you to say anything.

395
00:21:05,665 --> 00:21:06,864
I just wanted you to know.

396
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:08,666
Okay?
Bye.

397
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:14,739
What was that about?

398
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:17,375
Iris posted about the streak
again.

399
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:19,243
She signed her name to it.

400
00:21:19,245 --> 00:21:21,879
- Oh, that's not good.
- No.

401
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:23,581
If one of these bad
meta-humans

402
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,216
We're dealing with
figures she knows something...

403
00:21:25,218 --> 00:21:28,886
Then they may target her,
I know.

404
00:21:36,262 --> 00:21:38,262
Sorry, we're closed.

405
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:43,101
Oh, my god, it's you.

406
00:21:43,103 --> 00:21:44,569
Iris West,

407
00:21:44,571 --> 00:21:45,971
I hear you've been
writing about me.

408
00:21:53,112 --> 00:21:56,380
You <i>are</i> real.

409
00:21:56,382 --> 00:22:00,585
I should, um...
Let me just clean up...

410
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:06,457
Meet me on the roof.

411
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:08,126
I'll give you a head start.

412
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:20,972
I need you to
stop writing about me.

413
00:22:20,974 --> 00:22:22,673
There are a lot
of people who need someone

414
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:24,642
Like you right now.

415
00:22:24,644 --> 00:22:27,845
To know that you're out there.

416
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:30,114
I have so many questions.

417
00:22:30,116 --> 00:22:32,817
Where are you from?

418
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:35,153
I can't say.

419
00:22:35,155 --> 00:22:37,321
Who are you?

420
00:22:37,323 --> 00:22:40,091
I can't tell you that, either.

421
00:22:40,093 --> 00:22:44,328
How can you do what you do?

422
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:50,234
You're a terrible interview.

423
00:22:50,236 --> 00:22:52,670
There's more to this
than you can understand.

424
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,438
Just trust me, please.

425
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,275
I need you to stop.

426
00:22:57,277 --> 00:22:59,310
Can you stop?

427
00:22:59,312 --> 00:23:01,279
Running into buildings
and rescuing people

428
00:23:01,281 --> 00:23:03,214
Without them
even knowing that you're there?

429
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:04,916
I don't do this for the glory.

430
00:23:04,918 --> 00:23:06,384
So why do you?

431
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:15,826
Look, I have this friend,

432
00:23:15,828 --> 00:23:20,731
And he had something terrible
happen to him when he was a kid.

433
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:23,167
His whole life,
he's been telling stories

434
00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:26,971
About this impossible thing.

435
00:23:26,973 --> 00:23:32,076
And people laughed at him.
And shrinks analyzed him.

436
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:36,347
And he's been searching
for an explanation ever since.

437
00:23:36,349 --> 00:23:41,185
But now, suddenly,
it's like he's lost his faith.

438
00:23:41,187 --> 00:23:44,722
But you... you are proof
that he wasn't crazy.

439
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:51,462
Help me save my friend.

440
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:58,502
He's a lucky guy.

441
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:19,290
Hey, what's wrong?

442
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:20,958
Did Eiling find out you're here?

443
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,927
No.

444
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:27,531
Caitlin was about to give me
the not-so-good news.

445
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:29,734
The shrapnel in your body

446
00:24:29,736 --> 00:24:33,971
Has merged with you
on a cellular level.

447
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:39,644
And the technology required
to unsplice your DNA...

448
00:24:39,646 --> 00:24:41,445
It hasn't been invented yet.

449
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:49,487
Bette.

450
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:54,358
It's okay.
Roger that.

451
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,395
I just need a minute.
Don't worry.

452
00:24:57,397 --> 00:24:59,597
Pretty sure I can cry
without blowing stuff up.

453
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:12,476
- What now?
- She joins us.

454
00:25:12,478 --> 00:25:14,645
- Becomes a part of the team.
- Barry...

455
00:25:14,647 --> 00:25:17,982
You have an amazing
ability to help people.

456
00:25:17,984 --> 00:25:21,786
She makes things explode.

457
00:25:21,788 --> 00:25:23,688
She's the first meta-human
not hell-bent

458
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,056
On destroying this city.

459
00:25:25,058 --> 00:25:26,791
It's too dangerous.

460
00:25:26,793 --> 00:25:28,292
Well, she's not going
in the pipeline.

461
00:25:28,294 --> 00:25:29,694
I'm not suggesting
she go in the pipeline,

462
00:25:29,696 --> 00:25:30,996
But were she to remain
at S.T.A.R. Labs,

463
00:25:30,997 --> 00:25:33,297
It would put all of us at risk.

464
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:35,533
From who?
Eiling?

465
00:25:35,535 --> 00:25:36,935
Eiling is a dangerous man,
Barry.

466
00:25:36,936 --> 00:25:39,936
We do not want him as an enemy.

467
00:25:41,808 --> 00:25:45,142
After the lightning bolt,
what if you hadn't found me?

468
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:46,877
It could've been me.

469
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:51,682
Hunted, on the run, cut off from
everyone I know and care about.

470
00:25:51,684 --> 00:25:53,317
You guys saved me.

471
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:56,620
And I want to save her
just as bad as you do, Barry.

472
00:25:56,622 --> 00:25:58,789
We all do.

473
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:10,601
Joe.
What are you doing here?

474
00:26:10,603 --> 00:26:14,238
Going over the materials
in your mom's case.

475
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,741
How's it going with you?

476
00:26:16,743 --> 00:26:20,111
Stellar... I made friends
with a human bomb

477
00:26:20,113 --> 00:26:24,014
Who I promised I could help,
and then, I couldn't.

478
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:29,620
And I finally diagnosed why Iris
is writing about the streak.

479
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:34,692
She's doing it for me.

480
00:26:34,694 --> 00:26:38,829
To prove the impossible
is possible.

481
00:26:38,831 --> 00:26:42,199
How do you know that?

482
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:44,034
The streak may have talked
to her.

483
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:47,438
Barry, don't you think
Iris would recognize your voice?

484
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,207
No, I can do this cool thing
with my vocal cords,

485
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:54,078
Where I vibrate them
so I sound like this.

486
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,782
I know.
It's cool, it's cool.

487
00:26:57,784 --> 00:27:00,785
Whoa.

488
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:05,122
Well, you put that
out there now, so.

489
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:09,560
I want to keep her safe.

490
00:27:09,562 --> 00:27:11,228
You know the only real way
to get her to stop

491
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,630
Is to tell her the truth.

492
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:16,300
Man, you really want
to tell her.

493
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:20,004
- I tell her everything.
- Mm...

494
00:27:20,006 --> 00:27:23,007
Not everything.

495
00:27:33,452 --> 00:27:37,188
Is it that obvious?

496
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:40,958
Not to her.

497
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,727
But how long
have you known for?

498
00:27:43,729 --> 00:27:46,163
I have watched
you be in love with Iris

499
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:48,666
Since you were old enough
to know what love is.

500
00:27:48,668 --> 00:27:52,803
And I've been waiting years
for you to tell her.

501
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:59,076
But you haven't.

502
00:27:59,078 --> 00:28:01,979
Guess I was too slow.

503
00:28:01,981 --> 00:28:04,682
Now, she's happy
and with someone else, so...

504
00:28:04,684 --> 00:28:06,750
When the universe
wants to make something happen,

505
00:28:06,752 --> 00:28:09,653
Whether it be giving a young man
lightning speed

506
00:28:09,655 --> 00:28:12,256
Or putting two people together,

507
00:28:12,258 --> 00:28:17,161
It has a way
of figuring those things out.

508
00:28:17,163 --> 00:28:19,563
And I got to get home.

509
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:26,403
Thanks.

510
00:28:35,247 --> 00:28:37,047
Cisco?

511
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:39,383
He went home.

512
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:42,720
I think our Cisco's developing
a little bit of a crush on you.

513
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:45,723
Not sure I'm prize winning
date material anymore.

514
00:28:45,725 --> 00:28:48,726
Change is hard.

515
00:28:48,728 --> 00:28:52,463
The same accident that changed
you put me in this chair.

516
00:28:52,465 --> 00:28:54,331
Sorry.
I didn't know.

517
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:56,901
I don't share that story
with you to garner sympathy.

518
00:28:56,903 --> 00:28:58,669
I tell it to you
to illustrate a larger point.

519
00:28:58,671 --> 00:29:00,204
And what point is that?

520
00:29:00,206 --> 00:29:05,042
That I would do anything
to get back what I lost.

521
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:10,808
- As would you.
- I would.

522
00:29:10,816 --> 00:29:12,383
I just don't know how.

523
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:20,558
You soldiers, you call
yourselves sheep dogs.

524
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,092
Am I right?

525
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:24,461
Happy and normal until someone
attacks our flock.

526
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:26,430
Every good person
who was changed that night,

527
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:29,133
People like you,
people like Barry Allen,

528
00:29:29,135 --> 00:29:32,436
Those people
are your flock now, Bette.

529
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:36,140
And General Eiling will never
stop attacking that flock,

530
00:29:36,142 --> 00:29:40,878
And he always gets his target.

531
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,247
Unless you stop him.

532
00:29:47,586 --> 00:29:51,288
You know your duty, sergeant.

533
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:54,525
Kill Eiling.

534
00:29:54,527 --> 00:29:58,529
One last mission.
And then you go home.

535
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,947
Where's Bette?

536
00:30:16,949 --> 00:30:18,382
- She left.
- What do you mean?

537
00:30:18,384 --> 00:30:20,384
- Where did she go?
- She didn't say.

538
00:30:20,386 --> 00:30:22,519
Well, where the hell
could she be?

539
00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:32,129
- Go, go!
- Go, go!

540
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:37,668
On me.

541
00:30:42,474 --> 00:30:44,108
I'm ready to give myself up.

542
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:47,811
Oh, I highly doubt that.

543
00:30:47,813 --> 00:30:52,516
You think you can pull one
over on me?

544
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:54,885
You can't.

545
00:30:54,887 --> 00:30:56,186
Stand down, soldier.

546
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:57,655
I got back
on the military feed.

547
00:30:57,657 --> 00:30:58,789
Looks like they've gone
to the waterfront

548
00:30:58,791 --> 00:31:01,091
To rendezvous with Bette.

549
00:31:01,093 --> 00:31:02,926
She's turning herself in.

550
00:31:02,928 --> 00:31:05,095
She's not turning herself in.

551
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:09,733
Please, let him get to her
in time.

552
00:31:09,735 --> 00:31:13,237
All over the world, people are
plotting to destroy our country.

553
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:16,173
To end our lives.

554
00:31:16,175 --> 00:31:18,275
Brave American soldiers
are gonna die in that fight,

555
00:31:18,277 --> 00:31:19,677
But they don't have to.

556
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:23,747
Because of you,
we could have victory.

557
00:31:23,749 --> 00:31:26,684
All I've ever wanted was
to make the world a safer place.

558
00:31:26,686 --> 00:31:29,620
And it will be
when you're not in it.

559
00:31:29,622 --> 00:31:31,255
Take cover!

560
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,267
What are you doing here?

561
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:45,669
Being a soldier
doesn't mean you're a murderer.

562
00:31:45,671 --> 00:31:48,238
Don't become one now.

563
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:53,010
I'm sorry.
I didn't see him.

564
00:31:53,012 --> 00:31:55,679
Don't be.
It's not your fault.

565
00:31:55,681 --> 00:31:57,114
I'm glad you stopped me.

566
00:31:57,116 --> 00:31:58,549
I'm gonna get you back
to S.T.A.R. Labs.

567
00:31:58,551 --> 00:32:04,621
Barry, Dr. Wells.
He... he...

568
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,102
Guys, we have a problem.

569
00:32:18,104 --> 00:32:20,804
Is Bette okay?

570
00:32:20,806 --> 00:32:24,508
No.
Eiling killed her.

571
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:27,177
She's glowing.
She's gonna detonate.

572
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:29,113
Oh, my god, a mass that size,
the explosion, it would be...

573
00:32:29,115 --> 00:32:30,681
Devastating.

574
00:32:30,683 --> 00:32:33,183
Barry, you have to get her
away from the city.

575
00:32:33,185 --> 00:32:37,287
But there's no time.

576
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:39,757
Can I run on water?

577
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:41,391
I built up enough speed
to run up a building.

578
00:32:41,393 --> 00:32:44,094
How fast do I need to go
to run on water?

579
00:32:44,096 --> 00:32:46,130
Assuming your weight...

580
00:32:46,132 --> 00:32:49,733
450 pounds of force per step
for vertical suspension.

581
00:32:49,735 --> 00:32:50,968
Accounting for fluid drag.

582
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:53,730
Approximately 650 miles
an hour.

583
00:32:53,739 --> 00:32:58,039
You have to outrun
the blast or you'll die too.

584
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,000
Nothing out of the ordinary
occurred.

585
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,599
The military was
simply conducting

586
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,200
an underwater weapons test.

587
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:32,269
There is no need
for panic or alarm.

588
00:34:32,271 --> 00:34:35,272
Central city is safe.
I guarantee you.

589
00:34:35,274 --> 00:34:38,509
He murdered Bette right
in front of me.

590
00:34:38,511 --> 00:34:40,344
And there's nothing
we can do to him.

591
00:34:40,346 --> 00:34:44,381
Powerful men have a way
of avoiding consequences.

592
00:34:44,383 --> 00:34:47,718
- You gonna be okay?
- Yeah.

593
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,686
You can walk on water.

594
00:34:49,688 --> 00:34:52,656
Puts you in pretty interesting
company.

595
00:35:05,904 --> 00:35:10,841
If you came to do laundry,
I already have a load in.

596
00:35:10,843 --> 00:35:14,678
Uh, no.
I-I came to talk.

597
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:31,762
I was working a case.

598
00:35:31,764 --> 00:35:35,232
Someone I really thought
I could help befriend.

599
00:35:35,234 --> 00:35:38,202
But they died.

600
00:35:38,204 --> 00:35:39,937
Barry, I'm really sorry.

601
00:35:39,939 --> 00:35:44,741
I didn't know her that well.
But it still hurts.

602
00:35:44,743 --> 00:35:48,078
And as bad as I feel right now,

603
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:53,083
I know how much worse it is
to lose someone who's family.

604
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:59,923
Iris... Writing about this stuff,
putting your name out there,

605
00:35:59,925 --> 00:36:02,059
It's dangerous.

606
00:36:02,061 --> 00:36:07,831
So I'm asking you one last time,
please, stop.

607
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:10,300
And I am asking you
one last time

608
00:36:10,302 --> 00:36:14,104
To tell me what is really
going on with you.

609
00:36:14,106 --> 00:36:18,108
Why am I the only one of us
who's interested in this?

610
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:33,757
I guess, just,
all this stuff with my family,

611
00:36:33,759 --> 00:36:38,795
I finally just put it behind me.

612
00:36:38,797 --> 00:36:43,734
I'm asking you to also.

613
00:36:43,736 --> 00:36:45,569
That may have been
how this started,

614
00:36:45,571 --> 00:36:49,406
But it's about something more
than that for me now.

615
00:36:49,408 --> 00:36:53,243
Whoever this streak is,
wherever he comes from,

616
00:36:53,245 --> 00:36:57,414
I am not stopping until the rest
of the world believes in him.

617
00:37:08,126 --> 00:37:10,994
Maybe we shouldn't
see each other for a while.

618
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:17,868
Yeah.

619
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:38,555
Can I get another club
soda, please?

620
00:37:43,628 --> 00:37:45,228
Hey.

621
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:47,164
Hey, what are you guys
doing here?

622
00:37:47,166 --> 00:37:49,633
We thought we
should have a toast.

623
00:37:49,635 --> 00:37:51,635
Doesn't work on me, remember?

624
00:37:51,637 --> 00:37:53,403
Barry Allen, you of all people

625
00:37:53,405 --> 00:37:57,040
Should know
that nothing is impossible.

626
00:37:57,042 --> 00:38:01,144
I distilled a highly fermented,
potent suspension.

627
00:38:01,146 --> 00:38:03,647
It's basically 500 proof.

628
00:38:03,649 --> 00:38:08,151
I figured if anybody could use
a drink tonight, it was you.

629
00:38:08,153 --> 00:38:09,753
So here's to Bette.

630
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:15,092
Bette.

631
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:22,699
Whoa, oh.

632
00:38:22,701 --> 00:38:24,434
That hit too quick.

633
00:38:24,436 --> 00:38:26,803
Are you buzzed?

634
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:30,540
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm buzzed for sure.

635
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:34,945
Whoa.
Whoa, that is good stuff.

636
00:38:36,748 --> 00:38:39,783
And it's gone.

637
00:38:39,785 --> 00:38:41,551
Work in progress.

638
00:38:41,553 --> 00:38:44,921
For a guy who has experienced
his fair share of mysteries,

639
00:38:44,923 --> 00:38:46,890
One mystery
I still can't figure out

640
00:38:46,892 --> 00:38:49,926
Is why some people
come into our lives.

641
00:38:49,928 --> 00:38:51,728
Why some people go,

642
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:54,264
And others become a part of you.

643
00:38:54,266 --> 00:38:57,901
Some friendships
feel like they'll last forever.

644
00:38:57,903 --> 00:38:59,936
- Hey, sweetheart.
- Hey.

645
00:38:59,938 --> 00:39:03,140
There's dinner in the fridge.

646
00:39:03,142 --> 00:39:04,674
Okay, thanks.

647
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:06,043
Iris, about your blog...

648
00:39:06,045 --> 00:39:08,111
I don't want
to talk about it, okay?

649
00:39:08,113 --> 00:39:11,948
And others end far too soon.

650
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:15,619
Not every friendship
is meant to last a lifetime.

651
00:39:15,621 --> 00:39:21,024
What does last forever is the
pain when that person is gone.

652
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,514
I was wrong about you,
Harrison.

653
00:39:44,516 --> 00:39:46,817
You're still one step ahead.

654
00:39:46,819 --> 00:39:50,220
Impressive for a man
without the use of his legs.

655
00:39:50,222 --> 00:39:52,823
I'm afraid I don't know
what you're talking about, Wade.

656
00:39:52,825 --> 00:39:54,791
A girl who can transform
ordinary objects

657
00:39:54,793 --> 00:39:57,294
Into explosives with the touch
of her hand.

658
00:39:57,296 --> 00:40:00,297
Today I saw a man who can move
faster than the blink of an eye.

659
00:40:00,299 --> 00:40:02,199
Extraordinary.

660
00:40:02,201 --> 00:40:04,868
The night your particle
accelerator died

661
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:07,204
Was the night
the impossible was born.

662
00:40:07,206 --> 00:40:09,940
I think we should start working
together again, Harrison.

663
00:40:09,942 --> 00:40:11,342
I think you should leave.

664
00:40:11,343 --> 00:40:13,043
You know, I can have
a squadron of soldiers here

665
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:14,050
in minutes.

666
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,300
You know, I can have an army
of press here like that.

667
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,400
Believe me, general,
I'd be more than happy

668
00:40:18,617 --> 00:40:20,017
to testify to your involvement

669
00:40:20,052 --> 00:40:24,554
in activities
that were less than humane.

670
00:40:24,556 --> 00:40:27,524
Threaten me again
and I will end you, General.

671
00:40:27,526 --> 00:40:30,994
And I am not talking
about your career.

672
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:39,436
You know, I figured out
your little secret, Wells.

673
00:40:39,438 --> 00:40:42,005
Won't be long before the public
catches on as well.

674
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:57,154
This is everything
we've been working to achieve.

675
00:40:57,156 --> 00:41:00,357
We may have the same goals,
general, but not the same means.

676
00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:03,660
I will not have this project
end before it even begins.

677
00:41:03,662 --> 00:41:05,996
And as long
as he's on my premises,

678
00:41:05,998 --> 00:41:08,999
I will not have him subjected
to that kind of cruelty anymore.

679
00:41:09,001 --> 00:41:12,435
We're done.

680
00:41:12,437 --> 00:41:16,740
We're done.
General.

681
00:41:16,742 --> 00:41:20,010
Get out.

682
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:42,365
Hey.

683
00:41:42,367 --> 00:41:45,268
It's okay.

684
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:46,736
It's okay, boy.

685
00:41:46,738 --> 00:41:48,905
It's okay.

686
00:41:48,907 --> 00:41:51,208
He's gone.

687
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:54,544
Don't you worry.

688
00:41:54,546 --> 00:41:57,547
I have a whole different future
in mind for you.

689
00:42:25,977 --> 00:42:27,510
Greg, move your head.
