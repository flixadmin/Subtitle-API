1
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:24,710
I got nothing, sir.
No sign of Niobe or Ghost.

2
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:26,420
Nothing but blue pills.

3
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,255
Should we try to contact them?

4
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:30,382
Won't matter.
My gut says they're down.

5
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:33,635
- We should start back.
- If that ship can fly, we need it.

6
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:35,262
I was afraid you'd say that.

7
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:38,098
ROLAND: Search every pipe, every hole,
every crack we know.

8
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,726
Sweep as wide as possible,
as fast as possible.

9
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:44,605
- Lines are crawling with calamari.
- Then the sooner we find them the better.

10
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,779
Thought you could use
something to eat.

11
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,656
Thank you.

12
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,367
Any change?

13
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,245
No.

14
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:05,125
- How is he?
- He's gonna be fine.

15
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,919
At least until he wakes up.

16
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:12,257
- What do you mean?
- Captain has some questions for him.

17
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:14,593
He'd better have some good answers.

18
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,929
You see these cuts?
I think they're self-inflicted.

19
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:22,184
- Why?
- VDTs maybe. I don't know.

20
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:25,646
But like I said,
the answer better be good.

21
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:31,985
MORPHEUS: Roland, I'd like to run
another search through the Matrix.

22
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,404
- For what?
- For Neo.

23
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:37,783
How could he be in the Matrix, sir?
He's not plugged in.

24
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,284
Please, for me.

25
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,506
This is what keeps bothering me.

26
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,675
What?

27
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:58,553
MAGGIE: His neural patterns don't read
like someone who's in a coma.

28
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,640
The strange thing is,
I see these patterns all the time.

29
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:05,143
- Where?
- On someone jacked in.

30
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:20,158
The big <i>bupkes</i>. Nada. 
He's not in there.

31
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:22,536
COLT: Sir, I got the projections.
ROLAND: How long?

32
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:27,249
Based on point of entry and past speed,
the machines will be in Zion in 20 hours.

33
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:30,043
Jesus H. Christ.

34
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:34,840
All right, let's move with a purpose.
AK, I want you on holographics.

35
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:38,176
Mauser, I want forward and aft guns
manned at all times.

36
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,470
Make sure we're running
on as few pads as possible.

37
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,514
- Yes, sir.
- Hey.

38
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:45,809
-Hey! You got a call.
ROLAND: What?

39
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,354
Operator.

40
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:52,107
It's Seraph.

41
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:56,528
I bring word from the Oracle.
You must come at once.

42
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,001
Good morning.

43
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:15,756
- Who are you?
- My name is Sati. Your name is Neo.

44
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:20,010
My papa says you're not supposed
to be here. He says you must be lost.

45
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,180
Are you lost, Neo?

46
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:30,395
- Where am I?
- This is the train station.

47
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,485
- This isn't the Matrix?
- That's where the train goes.

48
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:39,946
That's where we're going,
but you cannot go with us.

49
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:44,075
- Why not?
- He won't let you.

50
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:48,789
- Who won't?
- The Trainman. I don't like him.

51
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:52,292
But my papa says we have to do
what the Trainman says...

52
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:56,379
...or else he will leave us here
forever and ever.

53
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:15,607
Morpheus, Trinity,
thank you for coming.

54
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:18,568
One thing I've learned in all my years...

55
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,822
...is that nothing ever works out
the way you want it to.

56
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:25,075
- Who are you?
- I'm the Oracle.

57
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:32,082
I wish there was an easy way to get
through this, but there ain't.

58
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,126
I'm sorry this had to happen.

59
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:38,880
I'm sorry I couldn't be sitting here
like you remember me...

60
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,967
- ...but it wasn't meant to be.
- What happened?

61
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:47,097
I made a choice, and that choice
cost me more than I wanted it to.

62
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,640
What choice?

63
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:51,935
To help you, to guide Neo.

64
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:57,023
Now, since the real test for any choice is
having to make the same choice again...

65
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:01,027
...knowing full well
what it might cost...

66
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,780
...I guess I feel pretty good
about that choice...

67
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:08,243
...because here I am, at it again.

68
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:12,289
- Do you know what happened to Neo?
- Yes.

69
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:17,168
He is trapped in a place between
this world and the machine world.

70
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:21,673
The link is controlled by a program
called the Trainman.

71
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,386
He uses it to smuggle programs
in and out of the Matrix.

72
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:29,723
If he finds out where Neo is
before you get to him...

73
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:33,351
...then I'm afraid our choices
are going to become difficult.

74
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:36,688
- Why?
- Because of who the Trainman works for.

75
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:38,690
The Merovingian.

76
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:43,403
He has placed a bounty on your lives.
You must be careful at all times.

77
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:48,158
Seraph knows how to find the Trainman.
He'll go with you.

78
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:52,078
For years he has protected me.

79
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,748
I hope he can do the same for you.

80
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:58,585
Please, follow me.

81
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,216
Oracle...

82
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,594
I know, Morpheus.

83
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:11,514
I can see you're filled with doubt,
clouded by uncertainty.

84
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:16,311
After everything that has happened,
how can you expect me to believe you?

85
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:18,229
I don't.

86
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:21,066
I expect just what I've always expected:

87
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:25,528
For you to make up your own
damn mind. Believe me or don't.

88
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:31,117
All I can do is tell you that your friend
is in trouble, and he needs your help.

89
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,704
He needs all our help.

90
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,791
- Are you from the Matrix?
- Yes.

91
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,292
No.

92
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:43,380
- I mean, I was.
- Why did you leave?

93
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:47,550
- I had to.
- I had to leave my home too.

94
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:51,471
Sati! Come here, darling.
Leave the poor man in peace.

95
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,139
Yes, Papa.

96
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:01,648
I am sorry. She is still very curious.

97
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:05,610
- I know you.
- Yes, in the restaurant of the Frenchman.

98
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:10,490
I am Rama-Kandra. This is my wife,
Kamala. My daughter, Sati.

99
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,659
We are most honored to meet you.

100
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:15,453
- You are programs.
- Oh, yes.

101
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:20,083
I am the power-plant systems manager
for recycling operations.

102
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:24,337
My wife is an interactive software
programmer. She is highly creative.

103
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,007
What are you doing here?
You do not belong here.

104
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:32,095
Kamala! Goodness, I apologize.
My wife can be very direct.

105
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,848
It's okay.

106
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,683
I don't have an answer.

107
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:40,395
-I don't even know where "here" is.
RAMA: This place is nowhere.

108
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,356
It is between your world and our world.

109
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,861
- Who's the Trainman?
- He works for the Frenchman.

110
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,238
Why did I know
you were going to say that?

111
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:54,367
The Frenchman does not forget,
and he does not forgive.

112
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,412
- You know him?
- I know only what I need to know.

113
00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:01,541
I know if you want to take something
from our world into your world...

114
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,961
...that does not belong there,
you must go to the Frenchman.

115
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:06,755
Is that what you're doing here?

116
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:10,884
- Rama, please.
- I do not want to be cruel, Kamala.

117
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,636
He may never see another face
for the rest of his life.

118
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,847
I'm sorry.

119
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:19,309
- You don't have to answer that question.
- No, I don't mind.

120
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,228
The answer is simple.

121
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,195
I love my daughter very much.

122
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:33,907
I find her to be the most beautiful thing
I have ever seen.

123
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,785
But where we are from,
that is not enough.

124
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:39,621
Every program that is created
must have a purpose.

125
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:43,166
If it does not, it is deleted.

126
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:47,003
I went to the Frenchman
to save my daughter.

127
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,925
- You do not understand.
- I just have never...

128
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,469
Heard a program speak of love.

129
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:59,599
- It is a human emotion.
- No, it is a word.

130
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:04,145
What matters is the connection
the word implies.

131
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:09,567
I see that you are in love.

132
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:14,114
Can you tell me what you would give
to hold on to that connection?

133
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,615
Anything.

134
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:17,784
Then perhaps the reason you are here...

135
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:21,246
...is not so different
than the reason I am here.

136
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,880
That's him.

137
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,884
- Get away! Get away from me!
- We don't want trouble.

138
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,971
- Get the hell away from me!
- We need your help.

139
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:41,724
I can't help you!
No one can help you!

140
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:58,908
[GUN SHOOTING]

141
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,194
Oh, no!

142
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,166
Damn it!

143
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:55,215
- When is the train due?
- It is already late.

144
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,592
It's not like the Trainman to be late.

145
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,220
You think it has something
to do with me?

146
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,721
I cannot say.

147
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:04,724
Who knows such things?
Only the Oracle.

148
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:07,769
- You know the Oracle?
- Everyone knows the Oracle.

149
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,688
I consulted with her
before I met with the Frenchman.

150
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,399
She promised she'd look after Sati
after we said goodbye.

151
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,568
Goodbye?

152
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,404
-You're not staying with her?
RAMA: It is not possible.

153
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:22,617
Our arrangement with the Frenchman
was for our daughter only.

154
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:26,246
- My wife and I must return to our world.

00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:08,961
Then I think it's time for me to know
a few more things.

313
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:10,879
So do I.

314
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:14,967
Tell me how I separated my mind
from my body without jacking in.

315
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:17,886
Tell me how I stopped four sentinels
by thinking it.

316
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:22,141
Tell me just what the hell
is happening to me.

317
00:27:24,268 --> 00:27:27,813
The power of the One
extends beyond this world.

318
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:31,525
It reaches from here all the way back
to where it came from.

319
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:33,944
- Where?
- The source.

320
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:38,782
That's what you felt when you touched
those sentinels, but you weren't ready.

321
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:44,913
You should be dead, but apparently
you weren't ready for that either.

322
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:49,668
The Architect told me that
if I didn't return to the source...

323
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:51,670
...Zion would be destroyed tonight.

324
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:56,175
Please. You and I may not be able
to see beyond our own choices...

325
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:59,094
...but that man can't see
past any choice.

326
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:03,348
- Why not?
- He doesn't understand them. He can't.

327
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:06,185
To him, they are variables
in an equation.

328
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:10,397
One at a time, each variable
must be solved, then countered.

329
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:14,276
That's his purpose.
To balance the equation.

330
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,820
What's your purpose?

331
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:19,031

Why? What do you want?

333

I want the same thing you want, Neo.

334
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:28,457
And I'm willing to go
as far as you are to get it.

335
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,460
The end of the war.

336
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:33,503
Is it going to end?

337
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:36,381
One way or another.

338
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:40,344
Can Zion be saved?

339
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:45,557
I'm sorry, I don't have the answer
to that question, but...

340
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:51,271
If there is an answer, there's only
one place you're going to find it.

341
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,149
- Where?
- You know where.

342
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:59,238
And if you can't find the answer...

343
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:02,908
...then I'm afraid there may be
no tomorrow for any of us.

344
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:07,246
What does that mean?

345
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:14,878
Everything that has a beginning...

00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:17,506
...has an end.

00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:20,592

But I believe he won't stop there.
He can't.

354

He won't stop until
there's nothing left at all.

from the <i>Nebuchadnezzar?</i>

467
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:44,692
None, and at this point there's no reason
to expect there will be.

468
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,861
Perhaps.

469
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:48,446
But we can hope.

470
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:52,033
I'm afraid hope is an indulgence
I don't have time for.

471
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,881
- Zee, what are you doing?
- Making shells.

472
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:09,717
They're evacuating our level.
We have to go.

473
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:12,220
- I'm not going with you.
- What?

474
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,890
They've called for volunteers
to hold the dock.

475
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,980
Kids, you stay here.

476
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:26,317
I know how you feel,
but you can't do this.

477
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,486
-I have to.
CAS: Why?

478
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:30,822
Because I love him.

479
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,866
I love him the same as he loves me.

480
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:37,370
And if I were out there and he
were here, I know what he'd do.

481
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:41,833
But you're gonna get yourself killed.
It's crazy, Zee.

482
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:47,171
Maybe it is. But ask yourself,
if it were Dozer...

483
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:51,217
...and you knew the only chance you had
to see him was to hold the dock...

484
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:53,511
...what would you do?

485
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,560
Make shells.

486
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:14,198
What the shit is going on over here?

487
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:17,910
An accident, sir. I didn't see...

488
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:20,204
- I'm sorry.
- Who the hell are you?

489
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:22,665
A unit volunteer, sir.

490
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:27,045
What's a pod-born pencil-neck like you
doing volunteering for my Corps?

491
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:31,215
I want to do my part, sir.
We gotta hold the dock.

492
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,677
- How old are you, kid?
- Eighteen.

493
00:42:34,844 --> 00:42:37,972
Should have said 16,
I might have believed that.

494
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,557
Okay, I'm 16.

495
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:43,311
Minimum age for the Corps is 18.
Sixteen's too young.

496
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:48,316
The machines don't care how old I am.
They'll kill me just the same.

497
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:50,818
Ain't that the goddamn truth.

498
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:54,614
Give me a chance, sir.
I won't let you down.

499
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:56,699
You do...

500
00:42:56,908 --> 00:43:00,495
...and you'll find me and the machines
have got something in common.

501
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:16,094
Okay, charge the igniter.

502
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,143
She lives again.

503
00:43:24,477 --> 00:43:27,605
Want us to patch an uplink to reload
the operations software, Sparky?

504
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:31,109
That'd be swell. Could you clean
the windshield while you're at it?

505
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:38,533
SPARKS: Uplinks in place.
I'm bringing her back online.

506
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:41,452
Looking good, except, uh...

507
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:45,331
Something's wrong
with the Matrix feed.

508
00:43:45,498 --> 00:43:48,709
No, there's not. You're looking
at what we're looking at.

509
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:52,380
SPARKS: <i>What's going on in there?</i>
- Whatever it is, it can't be good.

510
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:55,383
ROLAND:
The machines have taken Junction 21.

511
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,428
The way I see it, if we drop down
from broadcast here...

512
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:02,223
...intersect 153, we might surprise them.

513
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:06,978
We'll go first, hammer as deep
as we can, then blow our EMP.

514
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:11,149
Hopefully we can punch a hole
big enough for you to get through.

515
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:17,488
It ain't pretty, but the way I see it,
it's the only way back.

516
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,157
No, it's not.

517
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:22,410
There's another way. A support line.

518
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:26,330
It drops down right here,
1000 meters short of 21.

519
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:30,543
If we're lucky, we may be able to
slip down without them ever knowing.

520
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:33,129
That's a mechanical line.
It's impossible.

521
00:44:33,296 --> 00:44:35,339
- No one can pilot mechanical.
- I can.

522
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,508
- Bullshit.
- I've done it.

523
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:40,928
- That was a long time ago, Niobe.
- I said I can do it.

524
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:45,725
So what? You'll be the only one that can.
There's no way we can follow you.

525
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:49,812
Hi.

526
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:56,027
I know time is always against us.
I'm sorry that I took so long.

527
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:59,989
- But I wanted to be sure.
- Sure of what?

528
00:45:00,156 --> 00:45:02,283
- I know what I have to do.
- What?

529
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:05,703
There's no easy way to say this,
so I'll just say it.

530
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:08,539
- I have to take one of the ships.
- What?

531
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,458
To go where?

532
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:12,752
To the machine city.

533
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,256
[LAUGHS]

534
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:19,550
I know it's difficult to understand.

535
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:22,261
No, it's not. You're out
of your goddamn mind.

536
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:23,888
I still have to go.

537
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:27,266
In 100 years, no ship has been
within 100 kilometers of it.

538
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:30,144
- You'll never make it.
- I have to try.

539
00:45:30,311 --> 00:45:33,314
- Is this what the Oracle has told you?
- No.

540
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:36,817
This is asinine. If you want
to kill yourself, do it...

541
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:39,070
...but do it without
wasting our ships.

542
00:45:39,237 --> 00:45:42,198
- You have to believe me. I have to go.
- Bullshit!

543
00:45:42,365 --> 00:45:45,576
I am the captain of this ship.
I say where it has to go!

544
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:49,580
And this ship will go to hell
long before I let you take it anywhere.

545
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:57,255
- He can take mine.
- You can't do that.

546
00:45:58,256 --> 00:46:01,217
Don't try to tell me
what I can or cannot do...

547
00:46:01,384 --> 00:46:03,678
...with my ship
after that little speech.

548
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:08,266
- But for christ sake, Niobe...
- I'll pilot this ship, he can take mine.

549
00:46:08,808 --> 00:46:12,436
If we leave inside the hour,
we'll reach Zion as the machines do.

550
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:15,147
That's as good a plan as any.

551
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:19,068
It's a waste. A goddamn waste.

552
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:27,785
Two ships, two directions.

553
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:31,122
Sounds like providence,
doesn't it, Morpheus?

554
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,959
- You've never believed in the One.
- I still don't.

555
00:46:35,126 --> 00:46:36,836
Then why are you doing this?

556
00:46:38,421 --> 00:46:40,047
I believe in him.

557
00:46:41,841 --> 00:46:43,884
Thank you.

558
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:51,809
- What's that for?
- To help you relax.

559
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:54,812
To make it easier for you to remember.

560
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,648
What if I don't want to remember?

561
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,735
Why would you want that?

562
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:03,988
What if I blew that EMP?

563
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:06,991
What if I did destroy those ships...

564
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:11,954
...and I am responsible
for the deaths of all those men?

565
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:17,001
If I did that...

566
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:20,921
...it wouldn't be very safe
for me here, would it?

567
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:30,598
[GROANING]

568
00:47:30,765 --> 00:47:35,019
Of course, it might not be
very safe for you either.

569
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:45,029
I'm ready.

570
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:48,115
NEO:
Trinity...

571
00:47:49,033 --> 00:47:51,702
...there's something I have to say.

572
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:57,625
Something you need to understand.

573
00:47:58,793 --> 00:48:01,670
I know I'm supposed to go.

574
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:04,131
But beyond that...

575
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:07,551
...I don't know. I...

576
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:11,639
I know. You don't think
you're coming back.

577
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:18,270
I knew it the moment you said you had
to leave. I could see it in your face.

578
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:21,107
Just like you knew the moment
you looked at me...

579
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:23,651
...that I was coming with you.

580
00:48:25,778 --> 00:48:27,488
I'm scared, Trin.

So am I.

It took me 10 minutes
to buckle up one boot.

583
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:37,331
But I'll tell you something.

584
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:40,418
Six hours ago, I told the Merovingian...

585
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:43,587
...I was ready to give anything
and everything for you.

586
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:48,717
Do you know what's changed
in the last six hours?

587
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:50,428
No.

588
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:52,304
Nothing.

No one ever got away from me
as many times as you did.

Every time, I thought it was the last.

610

Every time, I was sure we had you,
but you'd slip through our fingers.

I really can't express
just how aggravating that can be.

as much as killing him.
