1
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:27,569
Whoa!

2
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,962
The kids getting bullied
are a problem too.

3
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,715
Honestly, the kids must have
a reason for bullying you.

4
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:54,763
Look.

5
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:56,615
It's okay. Take it off.

6
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:58,391
- Hands off.
- Don't you dare move.

7
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:06,607
You did nothing wrong?

8
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:12,072
Nothing you feel bad about?

9
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:16,993
Honestly, the kids must have
a reason for bullying you.

10
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:21,122
PROVIDING AN EDUCATION
THAT WARMS AND STRENGTHENS LIVES

11
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:31,633
You know, I really wish the school
would burn down.

12
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:34,385
<i>Till nothing's left.</i>

13
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,805
So that everything will be gone.

14
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,197
Hey, Dae-su!

15
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:06,126
What about others? Is it really just you?

16
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,085
I'm by myself.

17
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:09,170
What about downstairs? In the classrooms?

18
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,256
There's no one down there. It's just me!

19
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:25,311
Hold tight!

20
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,439
You're sure? There's no one else, right?

21
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,567
They're all zombies.

22
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:33,444
There are no survivors.

23
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,990
Pull it tighter, guys.

24
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:10,148
Give me your eye, huh?

25
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:17,947
What the hell?

26
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,951
Why didn't you die?

27
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,081
DOOR WILL OPEN AUTOMATICALLY
IN CASE OF FIRE

28
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,124
Guys!

29
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,376
The door's unlocked.

30
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,507
- Let's go!
- One, two, three!

31
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,804
- Look! A chopper!
- Over here!

32
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,597
- Help!
- Hey!

33
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:25,556
Over here!

34
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,766
We're here!

35
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,268
Help!

36
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,852
Come back!

37
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,229
- Help!
- Come back!

38
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,957
Where are you going?

39
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,542
Help!

40
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:03,594
Hey!

41
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,263
Over here!

42
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,726
We're here!

43
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,716
Mom...

44
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:57,355
Mom...

45
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,480
Fuck it.

46
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,240
He's gone.

47
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,450
What the actual fuck?

48
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:53,246
- Who's gone?
- Gwi-nam.

49
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,999
It's his smell.

50
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,418
<i>I hear his breathing.</i>

51
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,615
HYOSAN HIGH SCHOOL

52
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:04,692
What happened?
Didn't Gwi-nam fall from the fourth floor?

53
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:05,902
Yeah, I threw him off.

54
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,737
So how did he manage to survive?

55
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,951
Maybe he doesn't die.
He comes back to life.

56
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,663
He's not a human or a zombie.

57
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,543
Do you remember that girl
in the teachers' office?

58
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:23,836
I'm gonna kill you!

59
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,339
Give it to me, you fucker! I'll kill you!

60
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:31,427
- Yeah, she was weird.
- He's like her, isn't he?

61
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:33,762
You could be right.

62
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:37,391
Maybe Nam-ra is the same.

63
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,145
Look, I found an "O."

64
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,940
That's what you've got?

65
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:45,816
She'll be okay.

66
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:48,152
You can't guarantee that'll happen.

67
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,031
We can't guarantee
anything right now, can we?

68
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,909
We don't even know if we're gonna live.

69
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:56,744
Let's go make the SOS sign.

70
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,539
Bare-su.

71
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:06,003
What if it were On-jo,
could you just abandon her?

72
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:17,223
It came and left, huh? The helicopter?

73
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:18,932
Mm-hm.

74
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:22,019
Maybe they started the rescues.
Let's get to the roof.

75
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,522
What if that's the end of the rescue?

76
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:25,815
Maybe it's only the beginning.

77
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,776
We don't even know if it'll come back.

78
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:30,779
I don't think we should try
to go up to the roof.

79
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,281
What if it does come back?
What then?

80
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,615
- Nothing.
- Yeah, right.

81
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,827
We can't make it to the roof, anyway.

82
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:40,893
How are we gonna carry him up there?

83
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:43,082
Yep.

84
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,752
- Just leave me and go.
- For real?

85
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,380
Yeah. You should just go.

86
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,049
You mean it? You know me, right?

87
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,552
I'll do it.

88
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,512
Should we?

89
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,054
Shouldn't we?

90
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,683
Don't act all tough.

91
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,560
There are enough crazy tough guys outside.

92
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:05,605
I'm not gonna die from this, am I?

93
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,649
How would I know if you'll die?

94
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:11,878
Anyway, I think we should put up
a sign or something outside.

95
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:14,155
How's anyone going to know
if we're in here and save us?

96
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:17,199
Doesn't this place have a roof?
Can't you just get there?

97
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,744
They'll see us on the roof.

98
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:22,538
Well, there is a ladder
that leads to the roof, but...

99
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,415
There is, right? Where is it?

100
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:25,750
- It's outside.
- Outside?

101
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:26,833
Yeah, outside.

102
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:33,257
- Motherfucker. Get over here!
- Wait, wait, wait. Why?

103
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,759
- Outside? Outside?
- Oh.

104
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:35,718
- Sorry!
- Get back here.

105
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,136
Stay back.

106
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,299
Get your ass here.

107
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,532
- I'll put you outside for five seconds!
- Help!

108
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:41,432
This is too big.

109
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:42,558
How about this?

110
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,685
- Break it apart.
- Here's a big one.

111
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,020
How's this?

112
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:47,813
Not that one. Put it down.

113
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:48,981
Not this?

114
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,501
- Grab anything big and colorful.
- Can I use this?

115
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:53,778
Joon-yeong, go up there and look.

116
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:55,821
Careful. Careful.

117
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:58,866
How does it look?

118
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,660
- First...
- Yes.

119
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,286
The "O," it's just too narrow.

120
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,122
He said the "O" is too narrow.
Dae-su, hand me that long one.

121
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,917
It should be
much bigger than this.

122
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,419
Nam-ra, could you carry this?

123
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,047
Guys, keep it up.

124
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,382
That goes over there.

125
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,341
It goes like this.

126
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:18,219
- And the "S" is way too short.
- We need one more of these.

127
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:21,430
- Is this enough?
- Fill that spot in too. That's it.

128
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,140
Oh, I, I got this part.

129
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,142
They're too close.

130
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,727
Hey, spread that out a little bit.

131
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,104
Let's clean it up a bit.

132
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,523
Come take a look. We did a good job, guys.

133
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,316
Look.

134
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,610
Yeah, well, there's no way
anyone can miss that.

135
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,381
- Right?
- We did do a good job.

136
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,953
It's a little crooked, though.

137
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:46,497
<i>Hope is...</i>

138
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:51,836
the cruelest torture that prevents you
from giving up on life entirely.

139
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:06,434
REALTY

WOOGYEONG GIRL'S MIDDLE SCHOOL

HYOSAN ARTS CENTER

142
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:24,243
I can't think of anything else,
but I also can't stop trying.

00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,123
MYEONHAK-DONG

00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:32,168
HYOSAN HIGH SCHOOL

145
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,849
Once the temperature went up,
the white blood cells were activated.

146
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:51,103
But they were absorbed by the virus
and transformed into a different one.

147
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:10,372
Careful now.

148
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:16,587
The zombies...

149
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,301
Get a bite down.

150
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:26,430
You're doing great.

151
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,855
No, it's not broken.

152
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,609
So it'll get better soon,
just leave it like this.

153
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:40,986
Thanks, detective.

154
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:45,157
No need for formalities
in the middle of all this. Call me Jae-ik.

155
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:46,783
Okay.

156
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,721
Since we're stuck up here,
and we're getting to know each other,

157
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,372
can I be completely frank with you?

158
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,082
Yes, of course. Say anything you want.

159
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,250
Mm, okay.

160
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,502
- Dumbass. You're such an idiot.
- Aah! Ow!

161
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:59,463
You came all the way here just to shoot
some stupid Internet show?

162
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,715
You're unbelievably dumb.

163
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,885
What? Like and subscribe?
You like that more than your life?

164
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,929
You're one crazy stupid motherfucker.

165
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,347
I'm sorry, detective.

166
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,142
Don't call me detective.
I said to call me by my name.

167
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,269
It's fine, detective.

168
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:16,105
If you were my brother,
you wouldn't need to worry about zombies.

169
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,357
I would just beat you to death myself.

170
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:22,945
But someone has to uncover the real truth
and let the world know what's happening.

171
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,572
What? The truth?

172
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:27,700
Hey. Are you a journalist?

173
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:28,783
I...

174
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,871
Well, journalists don't dig hard enough
for the truth, you know?

175
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,081
That's where people like me come in.

176
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:36,458
Your excuses.

177
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,293
Oh.

178
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:42,464
It looked like your colleague
totally dumped you and took off.

179
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,258
Should I blast him on my show?

180
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,051
I can even interview you if you want.

181
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,972
- Forget it.
- You should take revenge on traitors.

182
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,055
Look.

183
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,059
I learned from my many years
as a detective.

184
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,853
The assholes fighting to stay alive,

185
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:58,647
and assholes coming at you
hoping to die can't be beaten.

186
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,025
I'm worried for the kids.

187
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,194
I have a pretty good number of followers.

188
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,030
I can cancel him socially for good.

189
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,866
- Oysterubbish.
- Orangibberish. Not Oysterubbish.

190
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:10,784
Who even cares? Just shut up, would you?

191
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,028
And just go pick up
everything we can throw, all right?

192
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,306
- What are you talking about?
- Why else? It's crazy hot up here.

193
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:19,043
You're gonna stay here
until you become human jerky and die?

194
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:21,754
Why is everyone I meet like this?

195
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:29,845
They're not moving.

196
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,806
No. The zombies follow sounds.

197
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:34,725
Another.

198
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:46,320
What are you doing?

199
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:48,323
You said you'd get rid of them,
not lure them in.

200
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,908
They followed sounds earlier.

201
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,535
Shit. Give me that.

202
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,329
Stop it. More keep coming.

203
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:56,789
I said you give it to me, asshole.

204
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,291
- I swear you're weird...
- Quick!

205
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,926
MUNPYEONG DAYCARE

206
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,513
Oh, my God.

207
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:16,432
Oh, my God.

208
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:19,937
Hey, sergeant!

209
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,772
- You traitor!
- Traitor.

210
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,110
Jump! Jump on top of the bus!

211
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:27,569
Jump down!

212
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,506
- I got it, asshole. Shh...
- Come on, jump!

213
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,530
- Let's go.
- What?

214
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,200
- I said let's go!
- What... But...

215
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,498
This is freaking me out.

216
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,670
Shit. That was close.

217
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,338
Hey. Jump.

218
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,507
What? I can't jump.

219
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,342
Don't give me that bullshit. Jump.

220
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,760
But I hurt my leg!

221
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:52,886
I know. Jump!

222
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,931
You should've just taken me with you.
Why did you jump first, huh?

223
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,851
- That's because you're slow! Come on!
- My leg is injured!

224
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:01,215
You want to die there,
or you want to break your leg here?

225
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,872
This is nuts.

226
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:05,983
But my leg hurts. What about my leg, huh?

227
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,818
- Se-bin.
- Yes?

228
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,820
Close your eyes, keep them shut.

229
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,364
Let's just go!

230
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,908
- I'll catch you... Hey, wait, wait!
- No, I can't!

231
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,493
Hold on! Stop! Stop! Stop!

232
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,078
Jump right now, asshole!

233
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,306
Damn it! Hold on. Okay. Hold on.
Just give me a second.

234
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,891
- I'll jump. Wait!
- Just leave him!

235
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:24,376
Can we just get going for God's sake?

236
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,335
Aim for here.

237
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,588
- Shit.
- What the hell are you doing?

238
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:32,134
Whoa! No! Help me! Help me, detective!

239
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:35,471
I mean, Jae-ik. Pull me up.
Please save me. Please.

240
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:38,849
All clear!

241
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:40,434
Here we go! Hold on tight!

242
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,061
Let's go, Ho-seong!

243
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,440
Ooh! Wait!

244
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:58,410
- What does SOS mean?
- It's a distress signal.

245
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:01,080
I know that. What does it stand for?

246
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:04,291
It doesn't stand for anything.
SOS is just SOS.

247
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:05,918
That makes no sense.

248
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,646
That's just how it is.
It doesn't mean anything.

249
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,672
Then rescue quickly...

250
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:14,259
Speed of save... Save?

251
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,571
Why'd you ask
if you're not gonna believe me?

252
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,097
I thought you'd know.

253
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,016
I do know. Look it up.
You'll see I'm right.

254
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:24,061
Whatever. How can I look it up?
I don't have a phone.

255
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,895
What?

256
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:29,525
I asked On-jo what SOS mean,

257
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,319
and she said it doesn't mean anything.

258
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,930
Just say you don't know next time.

259
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,198
Well, it's true.

260
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,741
It's true.

261
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,327
- Really?
- Mm-hm. She's totally right.

262
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,538
Why don't you believe her?

263
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,330
Hey, prez.

264
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,333
What does SOS mean?

265
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:47,876
That jerk!

266
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,086
Forget him. Let him be.

267
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:52,756
Is it true, though?

268
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:55,424
What?

269
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:59,179
Are you sure SOS doesn't mean anything?
Isn't it supposed to be an acronym?

270
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,307
- You don't believe me, either?
- Mm.

271
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,354
The sun's setting. Let's start a fire.

272
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:15,195
It's setting.

273
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,365
I think it's working.

274
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,326
I'm done.

275
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,245
- Already?
- Next.

276
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:24,997
All right. Let's do this.

277
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,714
You'll get tired. Slow down.

278
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:35,716
The fire won't start if he goes slowly.

279
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:37,342
Do it faster.

280
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,261
Faster. Faster. I said come on, faster!

281
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,054
Rub it faster!

282
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:42,806
What is it, cramps?

283
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:46,185
- My hands. I can't do it.
- I'll do it. Step back.

284
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,699
Hey, should we kill him?

285
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:02,784
Are you praying?

286
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,662
Stop praying. Try... Stop it.

287
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:08,957
It's hard. It won't work.

288
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,713
Isn't that smoke?

289
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:16,048
- Hey. Smoke.
- Smoke!

290
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,131
Hold on.

291
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,842
- Please. Come on.
- Blow.

292
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,446
Come on, blow.

293
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,887
- Be careful.
- Blow.

294
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,889
Did it work? Su-hyeok?

295
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:25,849
Come on, come on.

296
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:26,767
Damn it.

297
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,185
Shit.

298
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:32,313
Let me try.

299
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,031
- Hey.
- You're getting there.

300
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:42,950
Hey.

301
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,747
Just use this.

302
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,087
Well, I smoke sometimes.

303
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,844
You had it this whole time.

304
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,348
You don't want it?

305
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:10,894
Light it.

306
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,689
MUNPYEONG DAYCARE

307
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,242
Hey, traitor.

308
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:26,326
A traitor.

309
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,370
I went back and saved you.

310
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:31,039
You took the children
and abandoned me with this freak.

311
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,625
I found this bus and came back.

312
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,128
Seriously, man, use your head.

313
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,211
Asshole.

314
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,632
- Do you have a license to drive a bus?
- Uh, no.

315
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,092
I have a regular license.

316
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:44,094
I swear I'll kill you once we get there.

317
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:46,179
Starting with driving without a license...

318
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:47,889
- Stop, stop, stop the bus!
- Whoa!

319
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:53,395
What? What was that? It's a zombie, right?

320
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,355
Since when do zombies ride bikes?

321
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,524
- Dumbass. Hey, Oyster.
- It's Orange.

322
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:58,650
Take the baby.

323
00:21:58,734 --> 00:21:59,774
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Careful.

324
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,111
Be careful. Careful, careful.

325
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,113
Open the door.

326
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:10,412
You pull any shit, I'll fucking kill you.

327
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,255
If I become a zombie,
I'll go only after you.

328
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,708
- I'll bite your neck only. Got it?
- Yeah.

329
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,171
Oh, shit.

330
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:24,383
Excuse me.

331
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:26,385
Are you okay?

332
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:32,017
You weren't bitten or anything.

333
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:34,393
You're okay, right?

334
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,481
Yes, I'm okay.

335
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,568
Come with us. I'm a cop.

336
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:45,822
Sergeant!

337
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:49,951
Mr. Detective!

338
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:50,952
No, no, it's okay!

339
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,954
The soldiers are here. They're soldiers.

340
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:55,582
We're saved!

341
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,750
What was that?

342
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:03,924
Hey!

343
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:04,883
Don't shoot!

344
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:07,469
I'm a cop. Wait. I'm a cop.

345
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:10,305
Don't shoot! Here! Huh?

346
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:15,727
Chin down. Extend your left arm.
Don't stick out your chest too much.

347
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,479
Ooh.

348
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:18,897
This is so sexy, ooh.

349
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,819
- What's with the face?
- Take this seriously,

350
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:24,778
or don't do it at all.

351
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:27,239
Stop being so stuck up
about shooting arrows.

352
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:32,869
Yeah. Didn't work.

353
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,204
You thought it was easy?

354
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,790
Anything is easier than studying.

355
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:39,584
You can get into Seoul University
with good grades.

356
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,503
But if you're just good in archery...

357
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:43,505
you can't go anywhere.

358
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:47,551
We can't make the national team,
or get a scholarship to college.

359
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,679
There's nothing left to do.

360
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,348
Stop whining. Everyone knows
you'll make the national team.

361
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:56,309
You'll go to college
just by shooting arrows.

362
00:23:58,353 --> 00:23:59,353
Damn it.

363
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:07,696
Are you not?

364
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:11,032
You didn't make the national team?
No college?

365
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:28,008
You won't die
if you don't go to college, you know.

366
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:32,888
I really love shooting arrows.

367
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,058
All I ever knew was archery.

368
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,270
I don't know what else to do.

369
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:43,425
As long as I could keep doing it,

370
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:45,901
I didn't care about colleges
or corporate teams.

371
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,196
But now I...

372
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:52,657
I've nowhere to go shoot my arrows.

373
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:58,079
I'm only 19.

374
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:01,737
But I feel like there's no hope.

375
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:06,630
If the zombies were to kill
all the archers in the country,

376
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:08,673
you'll automatically make
the national team.

377
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:10,925
You're nuts.

378
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:12,719
That's a good thing?

379
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:14,054
Hey, it's hope.

380
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:16,518
At least you have potential
to become something.

381
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:20,018
Even if I survive,
I'm not getting into college.

382
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:21,353
CSAT? Fuck.

383
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,064
My answers are always C or D.

384
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,066
Why are they C or D?

385
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:29,319
C if I'm not sure about it,
and D if I'm clueless.

386
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:32,948
I swear it's like
I avoid all the right answers.

387
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:39,162
All right. That's enough of that.
It's time to teach me how to shoot arrows.

388
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:42,469
'Cause even if I totally suck,
it's better than you shooting alone.

389
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:58,597
Dae-su.

390
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:00,349
Yeah?

391
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:02,394
How was your audition?

392
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:05,438
They said I have to lose weight.

393
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,442
Well, you're a good singer.

394
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,029
Sing for us. I wanna hear it.

395
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,824
Just forget it. I don't want it.

396
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,618
I actually really like that song.

397
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:21,329
Is that so?

398
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,580
Mm-hm.

399
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:23,665
Really?

400
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:24,791
It's really nice.

401
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:27,377
You sing well.

402
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,300
It'll cheer us up.

You wiped that blood

You wiped that on the scratches

Like his blood is so clean?

00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:29,233
I had no friends
and a lot of stress back then.

486
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:37,241
Did you ever need a friend, though?

487
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,285
I'm not sure.

488
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:41,746
I can't really tell.

489
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,542
You always put up a wall.

490
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:51,547
You'd wear your headphones all day,
and you never said anything.

491
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,219
Wasn't it because you hated us?

492
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:09,565
I never hated you guys.

493
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,860
I just...

494
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:18,074
didn't have any friends.

495
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,700
Well...

496
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:23,913
I never really liked you.

497
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:31,879
I thought you didn't talk to us,
because we were beneath you.

498
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:34,173
I kind of hated you.

499
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,177
There were times that I wished
you just disappear.

500
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:43,558
Aren't you close?
You're the top two students.

501
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,143
That's why I hated her.

502
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:47,520
No matter how hard I worked,
I was always second.

503
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:50,690
But it's okay now.

504
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:55,111
I think I was able to come in second,
because of Nam-ra.

505
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:59,949
Hey. Second's good too.

506
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:04,453
I can't even be 20th. Right?

507
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,998
Hey.

508
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:09,625
Don't compare yourself to Joon-yeong.

509
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,085
I was just saying.

510
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:14,714
Why do you always get on my case
whenever I say something?

511
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,510
Wait a second. Do you like me?

512
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,847
Shut up, you moron!

513
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:25,933
I'm going to put it out there,
so you don't get hurt.

514
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,603
I like somebody else.

515
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,396
So don't like me.

516
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:32,773
I don't like you!

517
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:35,151
I'm not interested in you at all.

518
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:37,445
Dae-su. Who do you like, then?

519
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,488
He's, he's a total freak.

520
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:43,743
- His sister.
- Ha-ri from Archery?

521
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:45,912
You're insane.

522
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:48,080
I go crazy when I'm in love.

523
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:50,833
She's like my little Cupid.

524
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,752
Stop it.

525
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:55,755
If we get out of here alive,
I'm gonna tell my sister.

526
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:57,590
Will you really tell her?

527
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:58,591
- Yeah.
- What?

528
00:36:58,674 --> 00:36:59,800
To shoot and kill you.

529
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:01,636
I said not to like my sister.

530
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:04,680
You can't do that to me,
future brother-in-law.

531
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:05,598
You... Hey!

532
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:07,743
- Will you tell her? Promise?
- Yeah. To kill you.

533
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:10,478
Stop it. Seriously. I love her.

534
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:22,198
Gyeong-su...

535
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,412
No!

536
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,880
Ms. Park.

537
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:22,883
It's Gyeong-su.

538
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,470
They're all... Gyeong-su.

539
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,180
Na-yeon.

540
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:34,437
You were scared.
So were the others. That's all.

541
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:38,482
So make sure you go back to them later.

542
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:44,196
Go to them and tell them...

543
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:47,783
and tell Gyeong-su

544
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:50,453
that you're sorry.

545
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:54,831
Na-yeon.

546
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:57,375
Stay alive.

547
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:00,253
You have to stay alive.

548
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:06,302
And you're gonna help them
this time. Okay?

549
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:12,058
Do at least one thing to help them,
you understand?

550
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,079
Na-yeon.

551
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:36,791
It wasn't your fault.

552
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,043
It was my fault.

553
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:43,881
I'm sorry for cornering you.

554
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:58,186
You...

555
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:03,234
Na-yeon, you have to stay alive.

556
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:16,432
INSTRUMENT STORAGE

557
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,906
My mom and dad prepped
everything for my transfer.

558
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:34,867
They said to just go to Seoul.

559
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:39,038
But I really didn't want to go there.

560
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:46,587
I wouldn't have had any friends,
and I was afraid of the Seoul kids.

561
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,840
I didn't know what to do.

562
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:54,345
Then On-jo gave me a great idea.

563
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:00,100
She said I just had to cut school
for five days.

564
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:04,063
Then the principal can't write you
a recommendation.

565
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,274
So that's what I did.

566
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,904
It's all thanks to On-jo...

567
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:15,783
that I didn't have to transfer.

568
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,746
I should've just gone to Seoul.

569
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,960
Then none of this
would have happened to me.

570
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:29,612
People have always said...

571
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:33,801
my sister was an archery prodigy
ever since she was little.

572
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:37,972
So our parents only cared about

573
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:41,141
trying to get my sister
onto the national team.

574
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:45,187
They've never paid attention to me at all.

575
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,191
I'll give you all my attention,
brother-in-law.

576
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:52,528
Don't be sad. You have me.

577
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,365
Thank God that I have Dae-su.

578
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:03,664
I don't really have anything to say.

579
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:07,793
I wouldn't really know...

580
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:12,131
but I feel like I made friends.

581
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:30,608
Me and...

582
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:33,319
On-jo...

583
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:10,064
What's that?

584
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:12,566
- It's... nothing.
- Well...

585
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:16,570
I have to go to the roof.

586
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,156
But the door's locked.

587
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:23,827
So I'm going that way.

588
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:30,542
- You're not a zombie, are you?
- Zombie? Fuck that.

589
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:36,799
Is that food?

590
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:41,844
Are you hungry?

591
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:45,724
Are you, huh?

592
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:48,394
Are you hungry?

593
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:55,859
Me too.

594
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:16,922
I just, well...

595
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:19,591
I just want some water, really.

596
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:21,677
Not stuff like that.

597
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:24,138
Be completely honest.

598
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:28,767
Be completely honest. Do you like someone?

599
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:37,568
- Mm-hm.
- You do? For real?

600
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:44,907
Yeah.

601
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:49,788
Why do you keep on stalling?
Do you have a crush?

602
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:52,708
Uh, pretty much.

603
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:54,793
Pretty much? What does that mean?

604
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:58,464
Who is she?

605
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:09,683
No one.

606
00:46:09,766 --> 00:46:10,851
Who is she?

607
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:13,187
Do I know her?

608
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:16,397
Who is it?

609
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:18,734
You.

610
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:21,487
It's you, On-jo.

611
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:24,531
I like you.

612
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:30,204
Hey. Stop that.

613
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:35,083
He doesn't mean it. He's just kidding.

614
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:41,298
I mean, we were friends and neighbors
since kindergarten, that's all.

615
00:46:44,801 --> 00:46:45,801
Stop joking.

616
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:48,680
I'm not joking.

617
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:51,934
Ever since I was six years old,

618
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,270
I've always liked you, On-jo.

619
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:59,149
And I always will.

620
00:47:04,821 --> 00:47:05,821
Awesome.

621
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:27,386
Cheong-san.

622
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:44,903
Did you know? I had no idea.

623
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:46,947
You're the only one
who didn't know.

624
00:47:47,614 --> 00:47:49,374
- Everyone knew?
- Yes.

625
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:52,679
- Why didn't I know?
- I didn't, either.

626
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:55,343
- Because you're you.
- Cheong-san's so cool.

627
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:03,171
On-jo.

628
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:09,719
I'm sorry.

629
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:14,046
You don't have to like me back.

630
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:15,100
Please don't.

631
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:16,184
I did it.

632
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:19,508
I said it all, so it's all good.

633
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:22,399
How is it all good? You're a jerk.

634
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:24,860
You were my best friend.

635
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:30,157
I-sak's gone and now you're gone too.

636
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:35,537
What is it that you want from me?

637
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:12,281
Did you...

638
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:15,035
Did you ever like me?

639
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:23,627
Not even a little bit?

640
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:27,881
You never liked me?

641
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:34,012
Would you please leave?

642
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:38,058
I just want to be alone.

643
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,271
You don't have to like me back.

644
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:04,561
On-jo!

645
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:12,068
Cheong-san!

646
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:19,284
Give me your eye, asshole.

647
