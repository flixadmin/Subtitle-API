1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:03,930
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:05,730
After five years in hell,

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:08,070
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:10,170
To save my city.

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,910
Now others have
joined my crusade.

6
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:15,610
To them, I am Oliver Queen.

7
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:17,780
But to the rest
of starling city,

8
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,410
I am someone else.

9
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,920
I am something else.

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,580
Previously, on "arrow"...

11
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:24,920
Man: Hello, Sara.

12
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,890
What are you doing here?

13
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,390
Oliver: Whoever did this,
I'm going to find them.

14
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,960
Apparently there's
another bidder for the company.

15
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,130
Who?

16
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,360
Ray palmer.

17
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,070
Yes, I am your boss now.

18
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,100
No! [sobbing]

19
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,240
Thea: Roy, I don't
trust you, or anyone.

20
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,810
Don't try to find me.
I am never coming back.

21
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,210
Now I've got
to go get Thea.

22
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,450
It's long past time
she came home.

23
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,480
Well done.

24
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,160
Thanks, dad.

25
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,670
[engine starts]

26
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,180
So, where are we going?

27
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,440
Wherever you want.

28
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,380
It's up to me?
Why not?

29
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,550
I'm a well-traveled man.
I've been every place
in the world there is.

30
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,350
But you want
to get out of here.

31
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:33,820
Because if the police
know you're alive,
they come after you.

32
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,090
The arrow, too.

33
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,560
You're very
perceptive, Thea.

34
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,730
Knowing when people
are hiding something
behind their smiles.

35
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,630
Your mother
had that talent.

36
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,870
Yes.

37
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,070
If someone knew
where I was,

38
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,510
It would be
unfortunate--

39
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,210
For both of us.

40
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:58,480
So why did you
reach out to me?

41
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,010
You reached first.

42
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,650
Still.

43
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:05,720
I don't want to feel
this pain again.

44
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,820
I don't want to hurt

45
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,790
Or get hurt

46
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:12,630
Ever again.

47
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:16,960
And you seem like someone
who can teach me how not to.

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,330
I didn't do it!

52
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,130
A woman was killed
on a rooftop last week.

53
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,070
Black leather,
blonde hair, wore a mask!

54
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,870
I didn't kill her.
You were there!

55
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,670
I don't know
anything about it!

56
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,670
Your fingerprints
are on this.

57
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,040
From a fifth I drank
up there, but I--

58
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,610
What did you see?

59
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,080
Nothing!

60
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,910
I was up on the roof
with some buddies.

61
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,510
This lady,
she showed up

62
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,150
And she--
she told us to go!

63
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,190
Looked like
she could handle
herself, you know?

64
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,960
Whoever it is
you're looking for,

65
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,390
I wouldn't want
to be him.

66
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,930
Another dead end.

67
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:23,960
It took me a week to get
a hit off that print.

68
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,370
I had to reconstruct
the partial

69
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,230
Using a predictive
indexing algorithm.

70
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,140
Appropriate,
since it was
his index finger...

71
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:33,410
Not particularly
relevant now.

72
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,050
Don't worry, Oliver,
we'll find him.
He's out there somewhere.

73
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,650
No, he's not.

74
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,650
Trail's gone cold.

75
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,280
I hate to do this,
but I have to
head off to work.

76
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,190
Tech village
is open this early?

77
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:49,360
Have you figured out
where in Italy Thea's staying?

78
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,160
Yeah, about that--
she's not in Italy.
Hmm?

79
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,430
Or europe.
Or, well, she's--

80
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,830
Where is she?

81
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,130
I had to ping
her cell phone
to find out

82
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,700
Where in Italy she
was texting from.

83
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,570
Turns out, came back
Corto Maltese.

84
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,340
Corto's an island
off of South America.

85
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,670
What's up with your family
and islands?

86
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,510
Wait, Oliver.

87
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,510
Thea's letter said
not to come find her.

88
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,650
That letter
was addressed
to you, not to me.

89
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:21,390
I'm watching Laurel
go through losing Sara.

90
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,930
It's time
for my sister
to come home.

91
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,700
What are you doing?

92
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,400
Thea's gone because of me.

93
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,100
Because the lies
that I told her.

94
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,970
So I owe this to both
of you to make things right.

95
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,970
No. What are
you...Doing?

96
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,940
You can't travel
with that.

97

I've actually never
been on a plane before.

I know. You're not
doing anything

100
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,960
And I could literally
watch you forever.

101

Oh, yeah?

102
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,460
What about once
she discovers boys?

103
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,830
Well, that's what my glock
is for, right, baby?

104
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,040
Right. It's my glock.

105
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,410
I'm going to enjoy some
quality time with her
for the next few days.

106
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,020
I'm even looking forward
to changing a few diapers.

107
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,420
And I'm looking
forward to believing
that when I see it.

108
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:29,360
Why the time off?

109
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,330
You quit
the team again?

110
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,930
No, Oliver's going
to Corto Maltese

111
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,660
For a couple of days.

112
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,370
Could you
go with him?

113
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:42,540
Like I don't already
spend enough time
with Oliver as it is?

114
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,570
Team arrow may
have starling city
purring like a kitten,

115
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:49,540
But the rest
of the world is still
a very dangerous place.

00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,750
Including Corto Maltese.

117
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,610
Lyla, I already don't like
where this is headed.

118
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,580
We have a field
operative down there
who's gone dark.

119
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,220
All right, so send an agent.
Send a task force.

120
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,050
He's not in any
kind of trouble.

121
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,890
He hasn't touched
his panic button.

122
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:04,620
He's probably just drunk
in some belleza's villa.

123
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,730
Mark Shaw's been known
to miss a few days

Will you just
do me a favor...

00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,200
And see if he's ok?

127
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,870
Tell him to check in.

128
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,740
Two more days
and I'm going to have
to call in the cavalry.

129
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,910
And I don't want
to get him into
trouble with Waller.

130
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:22,810
Mark's an old friend.

She better not do
anything interesting
while I'm gone.

keep your hands up.

Well, I guess
that badge means
you're not here

For a self defense

No, I've already had
my fair share.

I'm here about one
of your students,
tom bronson.

A witness places him

Of a break-in last night.

141
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:02,180
Well, that's not possible.
See, because tom and I
were sparring last night.

142
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,950
Mr. Grant, do you
know that lying

143
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,190
To the district
attorney

144
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,590
Is against the law?

145
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,590
If by that, you mean
am I willing to lie

146
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,860
In order to keep
a good kid who just happened
to make a stupid mistake

147
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,960
Out of this system?
I think you know my answer.

148
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,930
Are you admitting
to perjury, mr. Grant?

149
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:20,700
Now that's a big word.

150

I'm just a dumb fighter.

151
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,370
Right?

Look, tom was here
with me last night.

We worked on his
uppercut combinations.

154
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:30,410
Like I said, in this city,
there's a lot of good people

155
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,110
Who get dealt bad hands.

156

They lose someone,
they lose themselves,
which is why they

Come in here
to work off that rage.

00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,690
I've gotten good
at picking out the types.

Types just like you.

00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:42,620
If I'm angry,
it's because I'm dealing

161
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,990
With someone who's
willing to lie to a d.A.

162
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,530
To protect a punk kid.

163
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:47,230
I don't think
that's the case.

164
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:50,730
Either way,

165
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:53,630
If you do have something
you want to work off...

166
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:15,260
So what's the play
with Thea?

167
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,720
Do you mind if I talk
to her alone first?

168
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,960
It's been a while.

169
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,290
Felicity able
to pin her down?

170
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,200
She gave me an address.

171
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,780
Thea!

172
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:46,150
Señor.

173
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,420
Cómo puedo ayudarlo?

174
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,220
Estoy buscando
a mi hermana.

175
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,890
You must be mia's brother.

176
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:53,690
I see the resemblance.

177
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,160
Is "mia" around?

178
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,460
She works. At the cafe.

179
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,570
Where's the cafe?

180
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:00,730
I'll show you.
Thank you.

181
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,710
[exhales]

182
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,450
I didn't come all the way
to south america

183
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,580
To have you poison me, did I?

184
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,250
[laughs]

185
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,550
It's a meditative tea.

186
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,120
It will activate
your mind and body.

187
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:26,390
I think I'm going to need
a little bit more than tea

188
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,730
To learn how
to use one of those.

189
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:32,170
The sohei buddhist
warriors believed that

190
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,800
First you fight
with the mind...

191
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,940
Then your sword.

192
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:41,410
I remember when
I was training

193
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,080
To be a warrior.

194
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,480
I began
just like you--

195
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,850
Devastated
by my wife's death.

196
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:49,150
I was...Angry,

197
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,380
And hurt.

198
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:55,990
The pain
was unbearable.

199
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,970
Like this.

200
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,770
You're out of your mind!
Put your hand in here!

201
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:15,310
Every warrior
must learn
the simple truth--

202
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:17,110
That pain
is inevitable,

203
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:19,980
And suffering
is optional.

204
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,780
[gasping]

205
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,080
Please, don't--

206
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,480
Don't do what I think
you're going to do!

207
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:27,420
You asked me
to teach you.

208
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,360
No.

209
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,900
Aquí tienes.

210
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,880
Thea.

211
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,750
Good to see you.

212
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,120
You, too.

213
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,490
How--how did you--

214
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:01,860
Well, it's not exactly
the amalfi coast.

215
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,960
[sighs]

216
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,560
Voy a cerrar, earnesto.

217
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,630
Didn't you flunk
spanish?

218
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:10,430
More like
skipped it altogether.

219
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,900
Well, you look good.

220
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,000
I like
your hair cut.

221
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,370
Thank you. Yeah,
wanted it short, you know.

222
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,010
It gets hot down here.

223
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:23,940
I'm sorry I lied to you

224
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,510
About it, Ollie.

225
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:28,550
I just needed some space.

226
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:31,620
It's ok. You've had
five months of it.

227
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:35,490
This isn't just a visit.

228
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:42,300
Got one
for you, too.

229
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,200
After mom,

230
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,070
I understood why
you left starling.

231
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:50,370
But Thea,

232
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:51,970
I miss you.

233
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:58,410
And I would
really like it
if you came home.

234
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:01,110
I miss you, too.

235
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,880
And I love you...So much.

236
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:08,760
But I'm never coming back
to starling city.

237
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:15,660
[Thea gasping]

238
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,230
Ahh!

239
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:23,200
I can't. Sorry.

240
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,770
There is strength
in you, Thea.

241
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:27,640
I see it, even
if you can't
see it yourself.

242
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,840
I'm sorry, this--

243
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:34,380
This just isn't me.
I'm not like you.
I can't do this!

244
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,550
It's all right.

245
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:41,090
It's not your fault.

246
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:43,390
It's mine.

247
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:47,330
Q.C. Stock up 10 bucks
at the open.

248
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:49,130
That is love, ha!

249
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:51,700
Ah, miss smoak,
good morning--

250
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,630
I think. I've been
here all night.

251
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,600
My predecessor left
things a little, um,

252
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,000
What's the polite way
to say this? Little wonky.

253
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,210
Sorry if I'm rambling.
I'm a little
over-caffeinated.

254
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,810
I just had
three espressos.

255
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:03,410
Speaking of coffee--
let me stop you right there!

256
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:05,310
I told myself
that I would stand firm

257
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:08,550
On a few points.
No late night emails,
no personal errands,

258
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:11,220
And definitely no coffee.

259
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,890
There'll be no espressos
brought to you by me.

260
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:17,390
I stand very firm
on that last point.

261
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:20,960
And I admire
your conviction.

262
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,330
This is jerry conway,
your executive
assistant.

263
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:26,930
And I wanted to know
if you'd like him
to get you a coffee.

264
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,170
Or are you just
anti-latte in general?

265
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:32,110
Um...Executive assistant?

266
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:36,080
I think that's
a yes on the latte.

267
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,080
Thank you, jerry.

268
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,310
Thank you, jerry.

269
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:40,610
Should we get to
work? Excellent.

270
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,150
Applied sciences.

271
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,880
Q.C.'s bleeding edge
research division,

272
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,320
Till some wacko
blew it up last year.

273
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,390
I'm sure they had
their reasons.

274
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,760
The point is,
it's the cornerstone
for my plan

275
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,460
To rebuild
Queen consolidated

276
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,790
And thus the city.
I've had my people

277
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,560
Working day and night
salvaging what they can,

278
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,430
Including this--
a file server

279
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:59,730
Containing applied
science's design work.

280
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,230
It's not working,
unfortunately,

281
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,200
On account
of being caught
in a massive explosion.

282
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,000
You want me to access the data.

283
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,840
A brilliant mind
at work already.

284
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,380
Speaking of, I got
to get back to work.

285
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:12,350
Then why are you
leaving your office?

286
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:14,850
Oh, I'm not.
I'm leaving yours.

287
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,130
This is Lyla's busy
work, man, you didn't
have to tag along.

288
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:32,600
Well, I don't know how
to vacation like
a normal person, Diggle.

289
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,770
What's the plan?

290
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:35,370
This spot's his
usual dead drop.

291
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,640
Lyla sent me over
this file photo.

292
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,210
Just make sure
he's all right.

293
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,740
Got him.
I got you.

294
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,710
He's a friendly,
Oliver.

295
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,450
Shaw.

296
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:55,860
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey!

297
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,660
Listen! I'm with
Lyla Michaels.

298
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,660
Have you seen any
capuchins today?

299
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,730
If that's a challenge
code, I got to tell you,
I'm not with a.R.G.U.S.

300
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:03,200
I'm just Lyla's
baby daddy.

301
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,960
Now, you didn't
check in, Shaw.
She was worried,

302
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,670
So she sent me
to find you.

303
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,740
If you're lyin',
you'll be picking
your intestines up

304
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,300
Off this sidewalk.

305
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,670
That's fair enough.

306
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:18,880
Lyla gave me a security
transcoder in my right
jacket pocket.

307
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,320
Pretty jumpy, Shaw.

308
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,430
Better jumpy than dead.

309
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,160
Copy that.
What's going on?

310
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,330
Not here.

311
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,270
Sorry, I had--

312
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,740
I had eyes on me
all week,

313
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,140
A whole
follow team.

314
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:47,070
Wait, Shaw. What makes
you so important?

315
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,340
I have hard intel.

316
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,910
Someone from Corto Maltese
hacked into the server

317
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,510
And acquired
the a.R.G.U.S. Actual.

318
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,880
They want to sell it.

319
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,280
Did I mention I don't
work for a.R.G.U.S.?

320
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,320
The actual
is an encrypted
data omnibus.

321
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,990
It's a complete record
of agent covers,

322
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:01,390
Personal details,
affiliated soft targets--

323
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:05,460
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
soft targets...
As in family members?

324
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,890
Yeah, as in women
and children.

325
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,800
You get why
this is so important?

326
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,130
Hi, my name is Laurel,
I'm an alcoholic.

327
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,670
All: Hi, Laurel.

328
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:18,870
A week ago, I...

329
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:21,980
Something happened.

330
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:25,580
Something that
I can't share
with anyone

331
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:29,750
For several
complicated reasons.

332
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:36,320
I thought that
I was going
to want to drink...

333
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,490
But I didn't.

334
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:39,930
Not even tempted,
really.

335
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:42,260
[inhales and exhales]

336
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:45,470
But what I am is...

337
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:48,530
Is I'm angry.

338
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,640
And I don't know
what to do with it

339
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,110
Or--or where to put
it. I just...

340
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:02,620
Thank you for
letting me share.

341
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:06,790
Are there any other
burning desires?

342
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:12,660
Erica. Alcoholic.

343
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,790
All: Hi, erica.

344
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,660
My boyfriend and me

345
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,160
Got into another
fight last night.

346
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:20,630
Some of you know,
he still drinks, a lot.

347
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,840
And I said something.

348
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,840
I know I should have
just kept my mouth shut.

349
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:33,380
I know I should
just leave him,
but...I can't.

350
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,750
Maybe there's a meeting

351
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,280
I should be
going to for that.

352
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,650
Laurel: Once a month, erica
gives a share like that

353
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,120
And it's getting worse.
Quentin: Yeah.

354
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,690
Do you know
the boyfriend has

355
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:43,990
Eight assault charges
against him?

356
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,460
And not just
in starling.

357
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,630
He's got warrants
out on him

358
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,090
As far off
as coast city.

359
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,700
And it takes everything in me
not to go after

360
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,160
A dirtbag like that,
but the day the cops

361
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,100
Start bringing their badges
into aa meetings,

362
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,100
That's the day that
the drunks stop coming.

363
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,680
I'm in position.

364
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,110
The sale of the actual
is going down here.

365
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:10,080
Only two of us.
You didn't want
to call for back up?

366
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:12,090
Hey.

367
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,320
That's the only insurance
policy you're going to need.

368
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,860
They're here.

369
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,130
You're not worried about them
seeing our ride?

370
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,600
How did you know
the buy was happening?

371
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,940
I've been a station agent
in Corto Maltese
for three years now.

372
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:36,510
I got this third-world
garbage dump wired.

373
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,180
What's wrong?

374
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,280
There's no buy,
is there, Shaw?

375
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,120
[groaning]

376
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,370
Sorry for lyin' to you,
John. Well, partially lyin'.

377
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:09,180
There is a buy going down,
just not till tomorrow.

378
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,140
I needed to get this first.

379
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,550
Thanks for helping me
decode the actual.

380
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:16,950
Oliver: Diggle!

381
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:36,140
[Thea sighs]

382
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:42,610
Should have got
the heavy duty ones.

383
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:44,310
I like your hair.

384
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:47,980
Are you and my brother
like travel buddies now?

385
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:50,220
No, we're just
worried about you.

386
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,590
[grunting]

387
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:56,390
Oliver said you weren't
going to come back, so...

388
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:59,690
I figured I'd come here
and try to convince you to.

389
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:00,960
Well, you can't.

390
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,300
Look, I get it, you're hurt.

391
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,460
I lied to you,
I lied right to your face.

392
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:08,000
But I--I need you to know
that when I said I wanted
to leave starling with you,

393
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,500
That wasn't a lie.

394
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,910
I didn't just leave
because of you, Roy.

395
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:16,240
My mother lied to me,

396
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,510
My brother.

397
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:22,150
I had to get away
from starling city
and all the secrets.

398
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:25,120
And I found
myself here.

399
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,950
Isn't it lonely here?

400
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,690
That's kind of what
I like about it.

401
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:33,630
There's no one here
who knows me

402
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:37,000
Or thinks of me
as Thea Queen

403
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,330
Or Thea Merlyn.

404
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,800
No one who lies
to me, or...

405
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:47,110
Tries to protect me
with secrets.

406
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:49,880
All I ever wanted
was for you to be happy, Thea.

407
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,310
I'm sorry I got
in the way of that.

408
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:54,650
I'm sorry that I hurt you.

409
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:57,780
If being here instead of home
makes you happy, then--

410
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,150
Then you should stay.

411
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,160
Roy?

412
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,930
Are you ok?

413
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:12,670
You look
a little tired.

414
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:15,640
I just haven't been
sleeping much lately.

415
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,340
You take care.

416
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,420
What do you mean?

417
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:38,490
It's not your fault,
it's mine.

418
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,430
I thought I could
do this differently,

419
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:43,530
But I can't.

420
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:46,600
I need to train you
as I was trained.

421
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,370
Treat you
as my student,

422
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:51,700
Not my daughter.

423
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,170
[gasping]

424
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,840
What are you doing?!

425
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,980
The only way to
forge steel is to
temper it with fire.

426
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:03,080
[gasping and groaning]

427
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,620
Stay away from me,
you sick son of a bitch!

428
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,120
Now we can begin.

429
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:14,530
Lyla: Why didn't you
call me sooner?
I could have helped.

430
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:15,960
I didn't want you
to worry, Lyla.

431
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,230
Besides, I thought
we could handle it.

432
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,560
Well, we've hacked
his email traffic.

433
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,600
He's got a buyer en route
to Corto Maltese.

434
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,300
Who?
The tech boys
are still working on that.

435
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,470
But Waller's dispatched
a wet team to your position.

436
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,070
They're not going
to get here in time.

437
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,780
They might.
Keep your powder dry.

438
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,480
Copy that.

439
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,480
We're not going to
keep our powder dry.

440
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,650
Hell no.

441
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,790
Hey.

442
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:45,390
Any luck raising
our digital lazarus
from the dead?

443
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:47,260
The hard drive
is toast.

444
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,930
And the power
supply.

445
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:51,230
And...The actuator.

446
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,900
Ah, I'm sensing
a pattern.

447
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:57,040
[cell phone vibrates]
sorry, one second.

448
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,170
Hello?

449
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:01,240
Hey, felicity,
this is John.
Where are you?

450
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,480
You wouldn't
believe me
if I told you.

451
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,280
Are you near a computer?
Kind of.

452
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,250
I'm looking for somebody
in Corto Maltese.

453
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,080
I'm actually a little bit
in the middle of a...

454
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,880
I need to know where
he is. I've emailed you
everything I have on him.

455
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,590
...Meeting right now.

456
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:16,120
I am so sorry.
It's a friend.

457
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,420
Um, well,
a few friends...

458
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:21,590
Actually. You know what,
it's a long story.

459
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,700
Heh. Why am I under
the impression that
you have a lot of stories,

460
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,270
All of which are long?

461
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,270
You want me
to come back later?

462
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:30,340
What? Sorry.
[beep]

463
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,900
Hello?

464
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,140
Felicity, I need a favor.

465
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,340
Are we favor
friends now?

466
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,480
Are we friends?
What?

467
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,310
Never mind, sorry.
[telephone rings]

468
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:41,980
Oh, dear god.
One second.
One more second. Hello?

469
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,220
We got cut off.

470
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,450
According to the file
you sent me,

471
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:46,690
This guy is somewhat
of a hacker.

472
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:48,690
Let me guess--long story?

473
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:50,790
Yeah, the guy
I'm looking for broke
into a.R.G.U.S's system.

474
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:52,690
And he left a trail.
It's faint--hacking-wise--

475
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:55,490
But with a little bit
of luck, I will find him,

476
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,900
Or his laptop. I will email
you when I have something.

477
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,230
I'm having
a bit of a day.

478
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,040
I need you to help me
find someone by googling
his phone or something.

479
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,970
Pinging his gps.

480
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:08,710
Can I call you back?

481
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:10,840
Is this what a typical day
looks like for you?

482
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:14,350
Believe it
or not, this is
better than most.

483
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:17,120
When felicity has Shaw's
location, I want you
to text me and I'll be there.

484
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,550
Thea?
Yeah.

485
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,190
Oliver, I don't
think she's going

486
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:22,720
To change
her mind on this.
She doesn't want

487
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,120
To hear from anyone,
and I don't blame her.

488
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,560
I mean, we both
lied to her. A lot.

489
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,560
I know, it's why it's time
to tell her the truth.

490
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,300
Oliver, when you say
"the truth"...

491
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,960
What happened
the five years
I was away,

492
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,730
Everything
we've done since
I've been back,

493
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:35,670
All of it.

494
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:37,270
Well, you might want
to think about that
for a second.

495
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:38,740
Lies are what drove Thea
away from starling city

496
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,470
In the first place.

497
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,740
The truth is the only
thing that's going
to bring her back.

498
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,880
Except you won't be
telling her the truth, will you?

499
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,910
You'll be telling her
that her brother has been
lying to her to her face,

500
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,220
With almost
pathological sincerity

501
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,520
For the past two years.

502
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,750
She won't believe
another word you say.

503
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:56,060
And you will lose her,
Oliver, forever.

504
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:59,530
Well, look around.

505
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:01,990
I've already
lost her.

506
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,530
I don't have
any other choice.

507
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,450
I hear you like
to hit women.

508
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:26,750
How about one
who likes to hit back?

509
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,750
[grunting]

510
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:37,600
You're right.
It's better when
they hit back.

511
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:42,770
[starts engine]

512
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:44,770
[tires squealing]

513
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:56,750
[sighs]

514
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,320
Baby, baby,
are you ok?

515
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,790
I'm so sorry.

516
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:05,960
I'm too relieved
to be mad at you,
I really am.

517
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:10,300
But, sweeTheart...

518
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,500
This is crazy.

519
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,770
What the hell
were you thinking

520
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:15,900
Going after that
girl's boyfriend?

521
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,770
There's just something
I needed to work out.

522
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:21,840
I know that the world
isn't fair.

523
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,680
I know that it's
a terrible place where...

524
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,980
Where people deserve
to get punished.

525
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:32,180
And they don't. I just...

526
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:35,890
[sighs]

527
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:38,420
For one night,

528
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,460
I needed the world
to be different.

529
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:44,130
Ok, Laurel,
Laurel...

530
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:45,800
What's going on
with you, huh?

531
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,430
You're not being
yourself lately.

532
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,930
And now you're
running around,

533
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,610
You're tuning
this guy up.
What are you doin'?!

534
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,610
Baby, you can
talk to me
about anything.

535
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:56,810
You know that,
right? You know that.

536
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:59,350
I know.

537
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,320
Talk to me, then.

538
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,950
[sighs]

539
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:20,270
Laurel, you're not
the arrow.

540
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:22,670
Or your sister.

541
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:28,310
You promise me
you'll never do anything
like this again, ever!

542
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:31,480
I promise.

543
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,510
It was a mistake;
I wasn't thinking.

544
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:49,090
If you want to stay
in Corto Maltese,
it's fine,

545
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,300
But there's not much
here in the way
of sightseeing.

546
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,870
I need to talk to you.

547
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:55,170
Look, between you
and your new
best friend Roy,

548
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:57,070
I'm pretty sure
you guys have
said everything.

549
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:59,370
I haven't.

550
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:01,810
Not yet, anyway.

551
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:04,080
[sighs]

552
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:08,210
Roy showed me
the note
you left him.

553
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,280
And you were right
about everything.

554
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,290
I have lied,
I have kept secrets.

555
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:15,920
The truth is that

556
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,890
If I tell you...

557
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:20,590
All the things
that you don't
know about me,

558
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:23,860
That I might
lose you forever.

559
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:27,370
I spent five years
in the worst
kind of hell,

560
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:30,340
And there were
things that happened,

561
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:35,240
There were things
that I did...

562
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,010
That if--

563
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:39,210
If you knew,

564
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:41,080
You would see me
differently.

565
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:44,850
No, I'll always
see you as my big brother.

566
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:47,390
I mean, no matter
what happened

567
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:51,460
To you on that island,
or who you became,

568
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:56,030
It's the secrets you kept
about my own life.

569
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:01,270
I mean, you lied to me

570
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:04,170
About who my father was.

571
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:11,740
Malcolm may have
been your blood.

572
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,580
Robert was
your father.

573
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:21,320
I lied to you
about him, too.

574
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,490
Dad wasn't the man
we thought he was.

575
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:27,260
He was better.

576
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:31,160
And I've kept
something from you
because I just...

577
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,570
Never wanted you
to know.

578
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:41,740
Dad made it off
"the gambit" with me.

579
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:44,980
You told me he drowned.

580
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:48,650
We made it to
a life boat
together.

581
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:51,850
There wasn't enough
food and water
for both of us...

582
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:56,090
So he killed
himself.

583
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:02,830
And that is one secret
that I'm telling you now

584
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:06,230
Because I need you
to realize...

585
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:09,540
Mom and dad,

586
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:12,400
They sacrificed
themselves

587
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:14,840
So that
we could live.

588
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:18,640
But if we're not
together, then...

589
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,180
We're not even
really alive.

590
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,780
You're my family.

591
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,590
And even if you
don't need me...

592
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:30,490
I need you.

593
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:36,130
Please just consider
what I'm saying.

594
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:51,140
John: He's here.

595
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,740
So's his buyer.

596
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:04,160
I was expecting
Armitage.

597
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:07,490
This country's soil
is not worthy
of mr. Armitage.

598
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,230
Do you have the item?

599
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:12,700
Where's the money?

600
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,100
And the transcoder?

601
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,920
We better go.

602
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,230
Where'd you get this?

603
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,800
Our hotel room.

604
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:55,640
Who are they?

605
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,740
Could be a.R.G.U.S.

606
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,710
That's not a.R.G.U.S.

607
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,620
Suelten sus armas!
Let's go.

608
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,260
Go!

609
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:28,270
A.R.G.U.S., they
know we're here.

610
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,380
Which is why I got a bunch
of Renta-soldiers

611
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,310
To secure the perimeter.
It's amazing how cheap
you can buy an army

612
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:33,910
For in this country.

613
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,360
Diggle!
Behind you!

614
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:54,230
I never said I didn't know
how to use a gun.

615
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:18,420
[all grunting]

616
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,670
[both grunting]

617
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,700
Lyla was your friend!

618
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,900
And you endangered
her and her daughter

619
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,070
For what, for a lousy payday!

620
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:04,440
Not a payday.
It's my ticket out.

621
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,940
Of what?
A.R.G.U.S.!

622
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:09,780
You don't know
the things Waller's
made me do.

623
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:12,610
The person
she turns you into.

624
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:14,210
That still gives you no right

625
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:16,820
To put a bulls-eye
on my family's back!

626
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,680
I had no choice.

627
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:20,920
But you do, John.

628
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,460
Tell Waller I died.

629
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,390
Tell her you put
a bullet in me.

630
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:31,730
If only.

631
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:33,570
Thea: I've been thinking.

632
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:37,470
I want to go home.
To my brother.

633
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:39,170
And all his lies
and secrets?

634
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:41,540
Maybe you haven't come
as far as I thought.

635
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,440
Let me prove it to you.

636
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:49,850
[both grunting]

637
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:08,470
Impressive.

638
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:10,470
[both grunting]

639
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:13,870
I had a good teacher.

640
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:21,510
[laughs]

641
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,620
Looks like
you're going home.

642
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,980
[both breathing heavily]

643
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:35,860
You let me win,
didn't you?

644
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:38,500
I'll be seeing you soon.

645
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,400
Safe flight.

646
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,440
Thank you.
Yeah.

647
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,250
You ok?

648
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:03,190
She's not coming.

649
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:09,190
I'm sorry, Oliver.
You did everything
you could, man.

650
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:13,570
Oliver...

651
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,510
I'm glad
you changed
your mind.

652
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:28,110
Still not sure
about flying
commercial, though.

653
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,120
Oh!

654
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:37,320
Thea,
are you ok?

655
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,130
Yeah. I'm fine.

656
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,410
Laurel?

657
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:56,840
I didn't know
the arrow
took vacations.

658
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,880
Hey! What happened?

659
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,450
I'm fine. Please.

660
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:03,050
What happened?

661
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:05,850
I tried to do good.

662
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:07,820
It didn't work out.

663
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,190
Oh, Laurel.

664
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:12,990
I know that
it probably
sounds insane.

665
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:16,230
It probably is, but...

666
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,630
Sara.

667
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:22,100
She gave me this.

668
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,340
And when I wear it,
it makes me want

669
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:26,200
To help people
like she did.

670
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:28,440
Like she's alive again.

671
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,340
I get it.

672
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,780
Sara had training.

673
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:36,480
She had years--

674
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,650
Oliver, I know.

675
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:42,490
Which is why
I need to start,

676
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:44,660
And I need
your help.

677
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,520
[sighs]

678
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,330
No.

679
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:53,800
Oliver!

680
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,230
No!

681
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,500
No.

682
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,670
I...

683
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:05,010
I want you
to consider

684
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:08,280
What would happen
to your father

685
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,980
If something
happened to you.

686
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:13,890
Oliver, ever sense
it happened,

687
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:15,690
I have had this fire
inside of me

688
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:19,160
That I can't get rid of
with booze or pills.

689
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,690
I need another way!

690
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:24,100
And the other night,
even though it went wrong

691
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,830
It was the first time
since Sara died

692
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:27,730
Where I haven't felt that fire.

693
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:30,300
I'm sorry,
but I can't.

694
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:34,740
And even if I could,

695
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:37,710
Sara would never
forgive me.

696
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:58,130
Yeah.

697
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:04,370
Hey.

698
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:06,600
Love you.
I love you both.

699
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:09,040
The two of you
were all I could
think about.

700
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:14,910
I'm just trying
to put her down.

701
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:18,550
That's ok, I just
want to look at her
for a while.

702
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,720
Ok.

703
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,050
I have to head
into the office.

704
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,590
So late?

705
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:27,560
I do whatever amanda Waller
asks, remember?

706
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:34,770
You ok?

707
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,300
Yeah.
Just hurry back.

708
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:43,010
What's with this guy?

709
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:46,310
Outstanding warrants
for assault and battery
in coast city.

710
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:49,250
Got an anonymous tip
he was in starling.

711
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:51,980
Anonymous tip, huh?

712
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:55,290
That's a bad break,
buddy.

713
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:14,640
All right.
When can I start?

714
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,910
Do you know how many
of qc's techs

715
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,820
Said this data
was unrecoverable?

716
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,620
Only all of them.

717
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:31,820
Seems like this would be
a good time to ask
for a few days off, then.

718
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:33,160
[scoffs] you
just started.

719
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:36,160
I know. But...My friend
was struck by lightning

720
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,100
And is in a coma.

721
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,330
Well, was.

722
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:43,070
I don't know. Um, it's--

723
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:44,500
A long story.

724
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,810
See ya.

725
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:49,840
Thanks.

726
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:18,700
You did good
over there.

727
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:21,310
I had a good teacher.

728
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:24,740
A judgmental, occasionally
temperamental one, but...

729
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:27,780
Those are
the best kind.

730
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:30,110
[chuckles]

731
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:33,920
Did Thea seem...
Different to you?

732
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,450
Her hair's a lot shorter.

733
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:38,360
But that's not what you mean.

734
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,890
What do you mean?

735
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:41,660
I don't know.

736
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:43,830
She say anything?

737
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:45,060
She may be...

738
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:47,700
Seeing somebody in
Corto Maltese, or...

739
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,470
If Thea was with anybody else,
I've got a feeling

740
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:51,970
I'd be the last one to know.

741
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:54,070
[footsteps]

742
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:56,940
Where is she?

743
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,510
Where is Sara?
