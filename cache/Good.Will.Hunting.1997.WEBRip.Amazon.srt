"Why shouldn't you?"

1391
01:32:48,214 --> 01:32:52,392
Why shouldn't
I work for the N.S.A.?

1392
01:32:52,436 --> 01:32:56,396
That's a tough one,
but I'll take a shot.

1393
01:32:56,440 --> 01:32:59,138
Say I'm workin' at the N.S.A.
and somebody puts
a code on my desk.

1394
01:32:59,182 --> 01:33:01,140
Something no one else
can break.

1395
01:33:01,184 --> 01:33:03,229
Maybe I take a shot at it
and maybe I break it.

1396
01:33:03,273 --> 01:33:05,971
I'm real happy with myself
because I did my job well.

1397
01:33:06,015 --> 01:33:09,540
But maybe that code was
the location of some rebel army
in North Africa or Middle East.

1398
01:33:09,584 --> 01:33:12,674
Once they have that location,
they bomb the village where
the rebels are hidin'.

1399
01:33:12,717 --> 01:33:17,069
Fifteen hundred people
that I never met, never had
no problem with, get killed.

1400
01:33:17,113 --> 01:33:19,855
Now the politicians are saying,
"Send in the Marines
 to secure the area,"

1401
01:33:19,898 --> 01:33:21,857
'cause they don't give a shit.

1402
01:33:21,900 --> 01:33:24,163
It won't be their kid
over there gettin' shot,

1403
01:33:24,207 --> 01:33:26,862
just like it wasn't them when
their number got called 'cause
they were in the National Guard.

1404
01:33:26,905 --> 01:33:29,778
It'll be some kid from Southie
over there takin' shrapnel
in the ass.

1405
01:33:29,821 --> 01:33:31,867
He comes back to find the plant
 he used to work at...

1406
01:33:31,910 --> 01:33:34,565
got exported to the country
he got back from,

1407
01:33:34,609 --> 01:33:36,785
and the guy who put
the shrapnel in his ass
got his old job...

1408
01:33:36,828 --> 01:33:39,962
'cause he'll work for 15 cents
a day and no bathroom breaks.

1409
01:33:40,005 --> 01:33:42,573
Meanwhile, he realizes the
only reason he was over there
in the first place...

1410
01:33:42,617 --> 01:33:45,794
was so we could install
a government that would
sell us oil at a good price.

1411
01:33:45,837 --> 01:33:49,928
Of course, the oil companies
used a skirmish over there
to scare up domestic oil prices.

1412
01:33:49,972 --> 01:33:53,889
A cute little ancillary benefit
for them, but it ain't helpin'
my buddy at 2.50 a gallon.

1413
01:33:53,932 --> 01:33:56,413
They're takin' their sweet time
bringin' the oil, of course.

1414
01:33:56,456 --> 01:33:58,676
Maybe they even took
the liberty to hire
an alcoholic skipper,

1415
01:33:58,720 --> 01:34:01,810
who likes to drink martinis
and fuckin' play slalom
with the icebergs.

1416
01:34:01,853 --> 01:34:04,247
It ain't too long till
he hits one, spills the oil...

1417
01:34:04,290 --> 01:34:06,641
and kills all the sea life
in the North Atlantic.

1418
01:34:06,684 --> 01:34:09,078
So now my buddy's out of work,
he can't afford to drive,

1419
01:34:09,121 --> 01:34:11,080
so he's walkin' to
the fuckin' job interviews...

1420
01:34:11,123 --> 01:34:14,126
which sucks because
the shrapnel in his ass is
givin' him chronic hemorrhoids.

1421
01:34:14,170 --> 01:34:16,389
Meanwhile, he's starvin',
'cause every time he tries
to get a bite to eat,

1422
01:34:16,433 --> 01:34:18,391
the only blue plate special
they're servin'...

1423
01:34:18,435 --> 01:34:21,656
is North Atlantic scrod
with Quaker State.

1424
01:34:21,699 --> 01:34:26,748
So what did I think?
I'm holdin' out
for somethin' better.

1425
01:34:26,791 --> 01:34:30,403
I figure, fuck it.
While I'm at it, why not
just shoot my buddy,

1426
01:34:30,447 --> 01:34:32,405
take his job,
give it to his sworn enemy,

1427
01:34:32,449 --> 01:34:35,147
hike up gas prices, bomb
a village, club a baby seal,

1428
01:34:35,191 --> 01:34:37,802
hit the hash pipe
and join the National Guard?

1429
01:34:37,846 --> 01:34:40,370
I can be
elected president.

1430

- What?

1431
01:34:43,808 --> 01:34:47,377

1433

Uh, Chuckie. <i>No, Chuckie's family. He'd lie </i>

1443

You'll never have that kind
of relationship in a world...

where you're always afraid
to take the first step,

1445

because all you see
is every negative thing
10 miles down the road.
