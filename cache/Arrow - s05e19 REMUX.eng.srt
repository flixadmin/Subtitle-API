1
00:00:02,253 --> 00:00:03,796
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,088 --> 00:00:05,339
After five years in hell,

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:09,093
I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,429
Today, I fight that war on two fronts.

5
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:13,848
By day, I lead Star City as its mayor.

6
00:00:14,098 --> 00:00:15,850
But by night, I am someone else.

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,102
I am something else.

8
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,855
I am the Green Arrow.

9
00:00:22,106 --> 00:00:23,106
Previously on Arrow...

10
00:00:23,274 --> 00:00:25,693
Zoe's in a foster home.
A good one, it looks like.

11
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:27,887
She shouldn't be anywhere near me.

12
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:30,424
I don't agree with that. I have
a lawyer friend who doesn't, either.

13
00:00:30,448 --> 00:00:31,449
I'm worried about you.

14
00:00:31,616 --> 00:00:32,801
Because you're into something,

15
00:00:32,825 --> 00:00:34,261
and you don't want to
tell anyone about it.

16
00:00:34,285 --> 00:00:36,329
You just have to trust me on this one.

17
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:39,540
If we can produce video
that Chase is Prometheus,

18
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:40,791
that's game over for him.

19
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:41,959
That is what we needed.

20
00:00:42,126 --> 00:00:44,006
Please let me be the one
to walk this into SCPD.

21
00:00:44,212 --> 00:00:45,532
I'm gonna throw it up on YouTube.

22
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,670
There won't be anywhere
that son of a bitch can run.

23
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:09,070
Delta Team in position.

24
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:11,405
Seems our friends are here, too.

25
00:01:11,656 --> 00:01:12,698
We're on site.

26
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,078
An A.R.G.U.S. drone confirms Adrian Chase
walked into the arcade at 0900.

27
00:01:17,328 --> 00:01:19,830
Sixteen hours ago.
That's a lifetime for Chase.

28
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:22,083
Yeah, but no one has entered
or exited since.

29
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:23,501
We got the bastard.

30
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:38,099
We have to move right now.

31
00:01:38,349 --> 00:01:39,349
See something?

32
00:01:39,517 --> 00:01:44,397
Yes. This is Maximum Force. It's vintage.

33
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,607
We cannot let anything happen to this.

34
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:48,859
I'm more worried about
something happening to me.

35
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:50,569
Will you two focus?

36
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:56,742
Incoming!

37
00:02:14,552 --> 00:02:15,886
Is everybody okay?

38
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:19,390
It was vintage.

39
00:02:33,738 --> 00:02:35,531
Looks like we found our guy.

40
00:02:43,748 --> 00:02:47,126
Chase escaped the arcade by using
a secret tunnel that led to Port Newark.

41
00:02:47,752 --> 00:02:50,129
Homeland Security's placed him
on a no-fly list.

42
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:53,424
No, he's not gonna leave the country.
He isn't done yet.

43
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,384
How do you know?

44
00:02:58,637 --> 00:02:59,637
Call it a hunch.

45
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:03,893
"A hunch"? Mayor Queen,
this city deserves better than a hunch.

46
00:03:06,437 --> 00:03:07,438
Excuse the interruption.

47
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:10,274
I can't hold them off any longer.

48
00:03:16,447 --> 00:03:19,784
All right, I will take a few questions.
Yes?

49
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,411
You worked side-by-side
with Adrian Chase for months.

50
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,831
How could you not know that you had
a serial killer in your administration?

51
00:03:26,082 --> 00:03:30,795
Well, Mr. Chase's secret life
came as a surprise to us all.

52
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:33,803
I can say that we are currently
following up some very promising leads.

53
00:03:33,923 --> 00:03:36,425
Are you saying
you have no idea where he is?

54
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:40,596
No, I'm saying that the details of
an ongoing investigation are confidential.

55
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,139
Yes?

56
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:46,143
I spent the afternoon
speaking with Gay Eked's father.

57
00:03:46,352 --> 00:03:47,552
What do you have to say to him

58
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:49,522
and the families
of all of Prometheus' victims?

59
00:03:49,814 --> 00:03:51,982
Well, I would say to them
what I'm saying to you.

60
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:54,693
We are doing everything
that we possibly can

61
00:03:54,944 --> 00:03:56,445
to bring Mr. Chase to justice.

62
00:03:56,654 --> 00:03:58,894
Do you have anything for us
other than canned platitudes?

63
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,468
Better question is, do we have anything?

64
00:04:04,495 --> 00:04:06,997
Manhunts aren't exactly
in Helix's wheelhouse, Felicity.

65
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:08,526
Yeah, you helped me unmask Chase.

66
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,587
Now I need your help
trying to find the bastard.

67
00:04:10,793 --> 00:04:11,978
Well, from what you've told me,

68
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:14,964
they've got Homeland Security,
the FBI, and A.R.G.U.S. working on this.

69
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:17,484
Yeah, and last night,
Chase played them like Maximum Force.

70
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:18,509
I used to love that game.

71
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:20,612
I know, I did, too.
Apparently, it's seen better days.

72
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:23,532
Point being, I was expecting you and Helix
to come up with a fresh perspective.

73
00:04:23,556 --> 00:04:25,992
Maybe pull out some new trick,
something Chase isn't gonna anticipate.

74
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:28,656
Well, it would help not having to
waste time reinventing the wheel.

75
00:04:28,853 --> 00:04:30,372
You wanna know what intel
they're working with?

76
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:32,523
Getting into Homeland Security
and the FBI is easy.

77
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:34,859
Their cyber sec is a bad joke.

78
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:36,902
But breaking into A.R.G.U.S.' network...

79
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:38,696
Allow me.

80
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:48,372
The intel of Chase being in New Jersey
came from an A.R.G.U.S. drone.

81
00:04:48,831 --> 00:04:49,831
Okay. So?

82
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:53,752
So, the information was then sent
to an unsecured phone.

83
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:57,339
Seems like a big-time breach
in operational security.

84
00:04:57,673 --> 00:04:59,091
- Wait.
- "Wait," what?

85
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:01,552
What if Chase has a buddy
inside A.R.G.U.S.?

86
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,555
Someone who tipped him off,
who pinged the unsecured cell phone?

87
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:10,102
Yeah.

88
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:55,439
- Mr. Mayor.
- Hi.

89
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,566
Could you give us some space?

90
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,611
Let's go.

91
00:06:00,778 --> 00:06:03,498
Chase probably knew Agent Pierce
was part of our operation in Jersey.

92
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:04,782
This could be payback.

93
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:06,283
Okay, Lyla, what killed him?

94
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:08,953
Cause of death
looks like blunt force trauma.

95
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:14,792
Felicity, Curtis, we have a camera.

96
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:20,422
Roger, Roger. We have clearance, Clarence.

97
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:21,799
What is our vector, Victor?

98
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,259
Guys, focus, please.

99
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,304
That's evidence.

100
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:28,681
A.R.G.U.S. evidence.

101
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:32,476
All right, I got the video.
Streaming back to your phone now.

102
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:38,023
- Here we go.
- You guys seeing this?

103
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:41,944
Well, we're seeing it.
It looks like a meta.

104
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:43,279
An invisible meta?

105
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:45,614
Or psychokinesis.
Though, some prefer telekinesis.

106
00:06:45,823 --> 00:06:47,926
I don't think so.
Check out what the elevator's doing.

107
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,070
Yeah, guys, Curtis is right.

108
00:06:49,118 --> 00:06:51,805
According to the elevator activity logs,
the car accelerated upwards at...

109
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:53,163
Oh, my God, nine Gs.

110
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,666
And then it just dropped into a free fall
for 40 stories.

111
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:57,001
Death by elevator.

112
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:59,003
This doesn't feel like Chase.

113
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:01,648
No. At first, I thought Chase was
trying to tie up loose ends,

114
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:03,275
but I couldn't find
any connections between them.

115
00:07:03,299 --> 00:07:05,179
He had his A.R.G.U.S.
security key still on him.

116
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,011
Why enter the elevator if not to take it?

117
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,054
Maybe to confirm the Kill.

118
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:11,682
Guys, how do we manipulate
an elevator like that?

119
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:14,310
Remotely. I mean,
everything's computer-controlled.

120
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:18,063
All right. However this happened,
let's just find whoever did it.

121
00:07:18,314 --> 00:07:20,524
We are on it.

122
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,730
Huh. Looks like the elevator
was hacked in real time.

123
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:24,941
Pulling up the rootkit now.

124
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:29,116
Oh, my God.

125
00:07:29,325 --> 00:07:30,492
"Oh, my God," what?

126
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,346
Nothing. There's a line of code here
I'm not quite getting.

127
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,290
But I think I know someone at Helix
who can help.

128
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,459
Hey, don't you need to show them the code?

129
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:42,171
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Yes, thank you. Very helpful, Curtis.

130
00:07:49,053 --> 00:07:53,140
I'm sorry, Mr. Eked, but the specifics
of the investigation into Adrian Chase,

131
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:55,059
they're just not open to the public.

132
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:00,230
The mother of my children is dead,
and you can't tell me anything?

133
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:04,068
I can assure you that the SCPD
and the Mayor's office

134
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:06,570
are doing everything in their power
to apprehend him.

135
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:08,030
We're gonna catch that scumbag.

136
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:11,367
Oh. Instead of working
shoulder-to-shoulder with him? Huh?

137
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,168
Sorry. It's just...

138
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,923
Things may not have worked out
between Gay and me,

139
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,092
but she was always there for the kids.

140
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:31,428
She loved them and they loved her.

141
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:33,597
And now she's gone.

142
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:51,448
Please find him.

143
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:54,451
Gay didn't deserve dying like that.

144
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:58,580
And no other family deserves this pain.

145
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:01,917
We will find him.

146
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,628
And he'll know
the true meaning of justice.

147
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:12,386
Thank you.

148
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:19,810
How many other victims' relatives
do we have today?

149
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:21,812
He was the last.

150
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,939
God, I don't think I could handle another.

151
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:26,942
These people are grieving, Rene.

152
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,557
I'm not saying they're not
entitled to their grief, hoss.

153
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:32,656
I'm saying hearing about it
all day long's a real buzzkill.

154
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,659
You know, I'd have thought
someone in your situation

155
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:38,454
would've been a little more...
Sympathetic?

156
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:40,831
- My situation?
- Yeah.

157
00:09:41,165 --> 00:09:45,252
Curtis might've told me about your wife
and your daughter.

158
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:49,006
Curtis talks too much.

159
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:50,507
I don't disagree.

160
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:54,011
But while he was talking,

161
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:58,098
he also mentioned that he offered
to set you up with a lawyer

162
00:09:58,307 --> 00:09:59,641
to help get your daughter back.

163
00:10:01,185 --> 00:10:03,020
And that was over two months ago.

164
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:07,357
I'm just not ready, hoss.

165
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,699
A polymorphous worm
concealed by a kernel rootkit.

166
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:17,177
Are you trying to talk dirty to me?

167
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:19,161
I have the code, Alena. I know your work.

168
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,306
You hacked that elevator,
you killed that A.R.G.U.S. agent...

169
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,040
- Just slow down.
- Yes or no?

170
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:24,500
- Kind of.
- "Kind of"?

171
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,835
I didn't mean to kill him, I swear.

172
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:29,355
I'd never knocked anyone out
with an elevator before,

173
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,191
- and apparently, there's a learning curve.
- Alena.

174
00:10:31,215 --> 00:10:32,855
I need you to hear me out for one second.

175
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,718
You murdered someone.

176
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,970
Accidentally, and for a good cause.

177
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:38,499
I can't believe I'm hearing this.

178
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,057
Cayden James.

179
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,660
He's the most skilled hacker
the world has ever known.

180
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:44,037
If he was, I would've heard of him.

181
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:45,622
No, you wouldn't have,
because he's just that good.

182
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:46,855
He's a ghost.

183
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:49,124
He's also the person that formed Helix.

184
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,293
What does that have to do with...

185
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,003
Eight months ago,
he was scooped up by A.R.G.U.S.

186
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:53,904
Not arrested, not charged, just taken.

187
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:58,158
And now he's being held without cause.
Being tortured, who knows what else.

188
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:00,970
And I had to take this off
that A.R.G.U.S. agent so we can free him.

189
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,914
Alena, you killed someone.

190
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,000
Before you get too judgmental,

191
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:10,146
know you're gonna help me free Cayden
from where A.R.G.U.S. is holding him.

192
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,170
Why would I do that?

193
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:14,174
Because before he was taken,
Cayden was working on a biometric tracker

194
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:15,703
that could recognize a heartbeat.

195
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:17,886
Powerful enough to scan
anywhere in the world.

196
00:11:18,262 --> 00:11:19,847
Anywhere Adrian Chase is.

197
00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:24,101
We have a problem.

198
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:25,936
- What is it?
- The problem.

199
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:28,897
After Damien Darhk
took my security implant last year,

200
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:32,401
I instituted new protocols to prevent
any sensitive A.R.G.U.S. information,

201
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:35,028
or location
from being accessed by a single person.

202
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:37,531
Access now requires
two of these security keys.

203
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:40,450
But Agent Pierce's key wasn't taken.
You found it on him.

204
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:43,036
- I found a very sophisticated copy.
- Smart.

205
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:44,788
Extremely. I almost didn't catch it.

206
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:47,916
If those keys have been compromised,
then they have to be reprogrammed.

207
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,645
The whole point of having the keys
is for them to be unhackable.

208
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:52,754
Reprogramming takes about 24 hours.

209
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:56,341
Lyla, clearly,
A.R.G.U.S. security is under attack.

210
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,553
But this doesn't feel like Chase.

211
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:02,681
And, quite frankly,
that is where we have to keep our focus.

212
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,182
And I sympathize.

213
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:07,436
But I've got almost all personnel
with keys in lockdown at A.R.G.U.S.

214
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,938
- "Almost"?
- Agent Ditkoff is 20 miles out,

215
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:11,356
near Port Talbert.

216
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:14,096
I was hoping your team
could escort her back to A.R.G.U.S.

217
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:16,820
Oliver, I know you wanna get Chase.
So doll.

218
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:19,615
But A.R.G.U.S. has always had our backs.

219
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:21,033
Yes, they have.

220
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,910
Let's call Curtis and Dinah.

221
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:24,828
Please let Felicity know
where we're going.

222
00:12:25,037 --> 00:12:26,038
Copy that.

223
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:28,683
Just let me talk
to my friends at A.R.G.U.S.

224
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:30,918
Maybe we can negotiate
for Cayden's release.

225
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:32,961
Sorry. It's just funny, you know?

226
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:34,331
"Negotiate with A. R.G.U.S."

227
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:37,317
Seriously, I really think they will.
Just hold off on taking the second key.

228
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:39,509
A.R.G.U.S. won't even admit
they have Cayden.

229
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:41,261
Besides, plan's already in motion.

230
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:42,554
What did you do?

231
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:44,981
Don't worry.
I hired professionals this time.

232
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:46,099
"Professionals"?

233
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:48,119
One casualty was enough
for this girl's conscience.

234
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:49,143
Like mercenaries?

235
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:51,031
You really can buy anything
on the Internet.

236
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:54,691
Well, are your Internet thugs
headed to Port Talbert?

237
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:57,497
Because they're about to
have some company.

238
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:14,169
Over Terrific here. Or Mr. Watch.
Or Watch Terrific.

239
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:15,379
Anyway, it'll come to me.

240
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:16,587
We're on our way.

241
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:19,758
Right. Seven-hundred feet ahead,
three bogies. Please hurry.

242
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:35,607
Dinah and I
are a few blocks away.

243
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:07,057
Hey, John,
I know you have to protect that agent.

244
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,180
We're on our way.

245
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:09,492
I know you have to protect her,

246
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,661
but I need you to let those guys
get away with her security key.

247
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:13,020
Wait, what? What?

248
00:14:15,147 --> 00:14:17,232
Hey! Don't move!

249
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:22,279
Oliver, we have a situation.

250
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,687
I need you to let tango
get away with that security key.

251
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:26,158
- Why?
- Felicity has information

252
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:29,036
that we don't have.
Oliver, I need you to stand down.

253
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:39,254
What the hell was that?

254
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:40,629
Felicity said we had to.

255
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:41,798
Why?

256
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:44,217
To catch Prometheus.

257
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:51,641
It's the only way to catch Chase.

258
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,101
No, it's not.

259
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:55,687
But even if it were, at what cost?

260
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,337
Agent Ditkoff could've been killed.

261
00:14:57,481 --> 00:14:58,624
No, the team was there to make sure.

262
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:01,234
She could've been killed,
just like Agent Pierce.

263
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:02,628
I told you, that was an accident.

264
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:05,280
And now, two keys are in the wind,
and A.R.G.U.S. is vulnerable.

265
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:06,632
What the hell were you thinking?

266
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:09,326
That we need to catch
this son of a bitch, no matter what.

267
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:13,997
Guys, a little support here.

268
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:16,541
Might be crossing a line, Felicity.

269
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,337
Well, you're the last person on Earth
that gets to give that lecture, Oliver.

270
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:22,964
Or second to last.

271
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:26,277
And don't tell me that you don't make
morally questionable choices

272
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:28,011
so that I don't have to. I have to.

273
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,864
No, you don't, Felicity,
you don't have to.

274
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:32,265
Lyla's right. There are better ways
for us to find Chase.

275
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:34,309
Chase has been in the wind for a week.

276
00:15:35,227 --> 00:15:37,580
He was trained by Talia al Ghul.
He knows how to stay in the wind.

277
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:38,724
What other leads do we have?

278
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:41,542
How else are we gonna
bring Adrian Chase to justice,

279
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:43,610
unless A.R.G.U.S. lets go of Cayden James?

280
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:46,404
- Not a chance.
- Then my only choice is to help Helix.

281
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:48,365
Your only choice?

282
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:49,759
Felicity, I thought
we're on the same side.

283
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,886
No, John, I'm on the side
that's gonna put Chase away,

284
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,387
so that he can't hurt anyone ever again.

285
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:54,454
Hey, Felicity.

286
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:57,499
Let her go, man. Now is not the time.

287
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:06,842
You wanted to see me, hoss?

288
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:08,635
Yeah. First, close the door.

289
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:15,392
Second, what have I told you
about calling me "hoss"?

290
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,435
- Don't.
- Right.

291
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:18,979
Yeah.

292
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,273
Just sit down.

293
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:27,612
Are you firing me?

294
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:32,209
Rene, there was a time when
I would've loved to hear you ask me that.

295
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:33,577
But no, I am not firing you.

296
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:35,579
I wanna talk to you about...

297
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:37,539
Zoe.

298
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:40,416
Yeah, your daughter.

299
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:42,210
Yeah, I know her name, hoss.

300
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:45,547
I thought I told you
I don't wanna talk about her.

301
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,007
Well, that's too bad,

302
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,986
'cause you happen to be working
for a guy who would give anything

303
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,469
to be with his daughter again.

304
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:55,640
What do you want from me, man?

305
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:56,975
An explanation.

306
00:16:58,268 --> 00:16:59,519
I looked into your case.

307
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:01,605
You have full visitation rights

308
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:04,691
as long as you're accompanied
by a court-appointed guardian.

309
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:08,528
And there's no record
of you ever visiting.

310
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:09,905
Please...

311
00:17:10,614 --> 00:17:12,157
Just leave this alone, man.

312
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:14,326
I think we both know I'm not gonna.

313
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,470
So why don't we just skip to the part
where you tell me

314
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:18,371
why you do not wanna see your daughter?

315
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:22,125
Okay.

316
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:26,004
When Curtis told me about
his lawyer friend, I got excited, okay?

317
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:28,381
Yeah, yeah, all right.
And then what happened?

318
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:31,509
I remembered why they took Zoe
away from me in the first place.

319
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:36,014
Yeah, sure, I could visit her

320
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:38,308
with a court-appointed guardian,
like you said.

321
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:39,596
You wanna know why that is?

322
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:42,436
'Cause I'm bad news.

323
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:44,856
- Yeah, you're an acquired taste, for sure.
- I hurt her!

324
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:48,474
What do you mean, you hurt her?

325
00:17:57,369 --> 00:17:59,496
I was reheating some soup for her.

326
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,085
It's just about all I could make her.

327
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:12,008
And it was on the stove,
and I passed out drunk.

328
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:18,390
Poor Zoe, she's trying to grab it,
and pulls it down,

329
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,475
and it burns her hand real bad.

330
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:24,646
And it was her crying that woke me up.

331
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,775
Zoe deserves better than me.

332
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:30,777
End of story.

333
00:18:31,987 --> 00:18:33,905
Rene. Rene. Get back...

334
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:43,081
Meet prisoner 38085, aka Cayden James.

335
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:45,250
What are you holding him on?

336
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,918
He's a person of interest.

337
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:49,796
So, no crime,
I'm guessing no trial, either.

338
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:52,338
Do you have something
you wanna say to me, Johnnie?

339
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,134
Not right now, Lyla.

340
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:55,986
There's something
we're not considering.

341
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,054
What if Felicity is right?

342
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,390
She might be right.

343
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:03,560
We give James a terminal,
we make him find Chase,

344
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:06,229
and then we hand him back to Helix.

345
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,898
I know you want Chase
off the board, Oliver,

346
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:11,776
but Cayden James
is as dangerous as a loose nuke.

347
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:13,486
I can't put him back in play.

348
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:15,822
Helix has compromised your security.

349
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:18,950
And now they have hired mercenaries
that are gonna go after A. R.G.U.S.

350
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:20,160
to get James out.

351
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:21,810
Which means we go after them first.

352
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:23,973
Curtis has intel as to where
their base of operations is.

353
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:25,790
And we'd be going in completely blind.

354
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:29,169
We have a greater chance of success
if we let Helix come to us.

355
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:31,588
Wait, Lyla.

356
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:35,675
You wanna set a trap for Helix
and use James as the bait?

357
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:39,568
I don't think I need to tell either of you
how dangerous Helix is.

358
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:41,264
This is our chance to take them down.

359
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:45,101
This is happening
with or without your help.

360
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:48,938
I'll let you boys
wrap your head around that.

361
00:19:56,488 --> 00:19:57,965
We have to get Felicity out of Helix.

362
00:19:57,989 --> 00:19:59,300
We can't let her get involved in this.

363
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:00,658
You mean any more involved.

364
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:02,619
We knew she was into something.

365
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,496
We knew it was bad.

366
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:08,291
We just let her get in deeper.

367
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,169
Oliver, grief can make people
do crazy things.

368
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:13,018
No one knows that better than you and me.

369
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:16,716
But I'm not the one she was gonna marry.

370
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:24,057
What's your point?

371
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:25,392
My point is...

372
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:30,551
Oliver, look. Maybe we should've
talked her out of Helix.

373
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,316
Maybe not. I don't know.
But the point is, we're here now.

374
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:35,360
And you're the only one
she will listen to.

375
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:42,742
I'm not sure how much credibility
I have with her.

376
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:46,329
You both wanna catch Chase, right?
You have that in common.

377
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,708
Which tells me you are the only one
who can pull her back from the brink.

378
00:20:58,174 --> 00:20:59,175
Oh.

379
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:01,344
- Hi.
- Hey.

380
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:03,691
Nice of you to use
the front door for once.

381
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:06,057
May I come in, please?

382
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:07,551
Actually, I was just leaving.

383
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:08,852
I can see that.

384
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:12,856
Sure.

385
00:21:17,569 --> 00:21:20,196
Looks like you're not sitting
behind a keyboard for this one.

386
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,199
- Can you blame me?
- No.

387
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:28,538
I, more than probably anyone else,
understand what it's like

388
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:30,915
to be willing to do whatever it takes
to stop Chase.

389
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:32,208
Then let me do it.

390
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:34,097
Let me just tell you
how I'm seeing things.

391
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:37,797
You're willing to do whatever it takes
to stop Chase

392
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:42,093
because I was willing to do
whatever it takes to save this city...

393
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:45,263
And that created him.

394
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:47,390
Okay, so it's ironic. That's what it is.

395
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:48,725
It doesn't have to be.

396
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:51,978
You see, we can think of
another way to find him,

397
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:54,564
and then we can find
another way to stop him.

398
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:56,733
Okay, how? The SCPD tip line?

399
00:21:56,941 --> 00:22:00,069
No, that's not gonna work this time,
Oliver. We both know that.

400
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:02,614
Look, this is our only chance.

401
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:04,949
And this is me asking you.

402
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:08,453
Don't do this.

403
00:22:10,413 --> 00:22:13,750
For the past four years, I have
watched you do whatever you had to,

404
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:16,586
whatever it took,
to stop the people threatening this city.

405
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:19,154
How can you stand there
and not ask me to do the same thing?

406
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:23,259
Because over the past four years,
you, more than anyone else,

407
00:22:24,594 --> 00:22:26,763
has seen the toll that it has taken on me.

408
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:29,098
- And I told you...
- And I understand, I agree

409
00:22:29,307 --> 00:22:31,547
that I should not shelter you
from making hard decisions.

410
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:33,603
But you wanna talk irony? Fine.

411
00:22:35,313 --> 00:22:37,607
You are willing to sell your soul

412
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:42,487
to destroy a threat that I created.

413
00:22:44,656 --> 00:22:45,657
How did...

414
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:49,672
One of the reasons I fell in love with you

415
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:52,664
is because you're always willing
to do what was right,

416
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,958
no matter what the cost.

417
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,127
Even if it's unbearably hard.

418
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:02,507
It's what makes you, you.

419
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:07,011
So how can I be any different?

420
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:14,561
You have sacrificed your soul
for the team, for the city, and for me.

421
00:23:16,521 --> 00:23:21,067
You don't have to
carry that burden any longer.

422
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:25,488
Let me do it.

423
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:28,908
Felicity, I...

424
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:34,998
I can't.

425
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:39,502
Then you'll have to stop me.

426
00:23:49,721 --> 00:23:51,723
This facility has eight ingress points.

427
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:54,225
I've got six-man teams stationed at each,

428
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:57,371
perimeter squads keeping watch,
and drones flying surveillance.

429
00:23:57,395 --> 00:23:58,915
Helix has to be ready for all of that.

430
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:03,526
That's why we're here.
Added support and the element of surprise.

431
00:24:03,693 --> 00:24:06,362
You think Felicity will be surprised
that we're trying to stop her?

432
00:24:06,571 --> 00:24:09,866
Actually, I am kind of surprised.
I mean, you and her have a history.

433
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:11,760
Just kind of like,
"We're against each other."

434
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:13,584
Let's have you and Dinah
patrol the southwest.

435
00:24:13,703 --> 00:24:14,746
Stay on comms, okay?

436
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:16,289
- Quick question.
- Mmm-hmm.

437
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:18,458
What do we do if she shows up tonight?

438
00:24:22,587 --> 00:24:23,588
We stop her.

439
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:34,223
Logistics calculates a 46% likelihood
they'll try to breach through here.

440
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:37,268
Okay. Then we'll be ready for them.

441
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,314
We're not expecting Helix
for another seven minutes,

442
00:24:41,564 --> 00:24:42,924
so would you like to use that time

443
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:45,568
to tell me what I've done
that's got you so pissed off?

444
00:24:49,072 --> 00:24:50,573
Lyla, I'm not pissed off.

445
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:53,117
But I am concerned.

446
00:24:54,077 --> 00:24:56,579
What did Felicity mean
when she made that crack

447
00:24:56,746 --> 00:24:57,914
about you crossing a line?

448
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:01,417
I can't even begin to fathom
the amount of crap

449
00:25:01,626 --> 00:25:03,670
that Helix has put
into Felicity's head, Johnnie.

450
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:06,756
But Lyla,
holding Cayden James without due process,

451
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:08,341
that's not a bunch of crap.

452
00:25:08,591 --> 00:25:11,469
Cayden James is 20 times
more dangerous than Snowden.

453
00:25:11,678 --> 00:25:13,838
We caught him trying to hack
an A.R.G.U.S. transponder.

454
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:16,432
If he got in, every NOC agent we have
could be at risk.

455
00:25:16,641 --> 00:25:18,810
That sounds a whole lot
like Amanda Waller.

456
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:22,855
Waller's decisions seem a lot less wrong
from this side of the desk, Johnnie.

457
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:24,315
You can't judge me for that.

458
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:26,943
I'm not judging.

459
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,321
I'm just worried.

460
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:34,927
Felicity Smoak is one of
the best people I've ever known,

461
00:25:34,951 --> 00:25:37,620
and she's gone over to the dark side.

462
00:25:39,706 --> 00:25:42,041
I don't want that to happen to my wife.

463
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:55,972
I've done a lot of illegal things,

464
00:25:56,139 --> 00:25:58,141
but none of them
ever required heavy weaponry.

465
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:00,309
Or any weaponry.

466
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:03,479
You know, I found the transition
between hacker to vigilante

467
00:26:03,688 --> 00:26:05,148
to be surprisingly straightforward.

468
00:26:05,857 --> 00:26:07,024
You're gonna do great.

469
00:26:07,358 --> 00:26:09,294
Besides, you have enough
firepower here to invade Russia.

470
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:10,695
Well, hopefully, we won't have to.

471
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:12,155
I think we might.

472
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:14,240
They know we're coming.

473
00:26:15,158 --> 00:26:16,159
I'm not worried.

474
00:26:16,868 --> 00:26:18,077
In case you need them.

475
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:19,871
No.

476
00:26:20,872 --> 00:26:22,665
I mean, even if we do, I'm not using that.

477
00:26:22,874 --> 00:26:23,914
A.R.G.U.S. will have guns.

478
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:25,644
I thought you said
no one was gonna get hurt.

479
00:26:25,668 --> 00:26:28,379
If we do this right, no one will.

480
00:26:30,006 --> 00:26:31,424
Wait for my signal.

481
00:26:38,723 --> 00:26:41,017
What's so important, hoss?
I was gonna call it a night.

482
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:44,353
Daddy!

483
00:26:45,188 --> 00:26:46,189
Sweetheart.

484
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:48,064
I told you.

485
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:51,032
Hey, you're not the only one around here
that doesn't listen to orders.

486
00:26:53,863 --> 00:26:54,947
Who's he?

487
00:26:55,782 --> 00:26:59,202
This is Quentin, Quentin Lance,
Daddy's friend.

488
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:00,953
But I call him "hoss."

489
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:04,123
He arranged this little visit.

490
00:27:04,707 --> 00:27:05,958
Thank you, hoss.

491
00:27:07,418 --> 00:27:09,962
- I missed you.
- I missed you so much.

492
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,423
I missed you more.

493
00:27:12,924 --> 00:27:16,219
Dang, girl, you're getting so big.
Look at you.

494
00:27:16,928 --> 00:27:19,388
Pretty soon you're gonna be
driving Pops to the games.

495
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:20,890
Isn't that right?

496
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:23,345
Tell your daddy what you're doing
at school now, Zoe.

497
00:27:24,894 --> 00:27:25,937
I made the hockey team.

498
00:27:26,229 --> 00:27:28,940
What? No way. What position you playing?

499
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:31,275
- Goalie.
- That's my girl.

500
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:33,069
Just like your pops.

501
00:27:33,486 --> 00:27:34,487
Oh...

502
00:27:34,904 --> 00:27:36,447
That's so good. I'm proud of you.

503
00:27:38,449 --> 00:27:39,784
Can we go home now?

504
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,585
I'm sorry, sweetheart, but not today.

505
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:51,629
Why?

506
00:27:54,966 --> 00:27:58,427
Sweetheart, last time you were with me,
you got hurt, baby.

507
00:27:58,761 --> 00:28:00,012
It was an accident.

508
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,682
When can I go home to Daddy?

509
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:07,478
I don't know, sweetheart.

510
00:28:08,771 --> 00:28:09,981
Soon, peanut.

511
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:13,818
There's a lawyer friend
Daddy's friend knows.

512
00:28:14,652 --> 00:28:17,113
And Daddy's decided
he's gonna talk to him,

513
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:18,721
and you're gonna come home with me.

514
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:23,369
I promise. Okay? I promise.

515
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:36,811
I thought you were
standing post with Lyla.

516
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:39,218
Seemed like a good idea
to put some space between us.

517
00:28:39,844 --> 00:28:43,180
Felicity isn't the only lady
who thinks the ends justifies the means.

518
00:28:43,514 --> 00:28:46,309
When Lyla and Felicity Smoak
are willing to cross the line...

519
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,352
Makes you wonder
if there even is one, right?

520
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,146
We got incoming.

521
00:28:50,897 --> 00:28:52,148
Tango's in the field.

522
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:53,524
Copy that.

523
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:57,528
What's that?

524
00:28:58,529 --> 00:29:00,656
Think of it as a weaponized tablet,

525
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:03,409
preloaded with Address Resolution
Protocol Spoofing.

526
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:06,829
The A.R.G.U.S. site is protected
by microchipped gun turrets.

527
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:09,165
Right. This will shut them down?

528
00:29:12,335 --> 00:29:13,575
You sure you're ready for this?

529
00:29:13,878 --> 00:29:14,879
Let's do this.

530
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:17,340
Bogie's on site. Want us to intercept?

531
00:29:17,548 --> 00:29:19,550
Negative. Draw them in closer.

532
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:45,743
Identification, please.

533
00:30:05,972 --> 00:30:07,098
It's not them.

534
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:08,556
Lyla, sitrep.

535
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:11,102
The van checked out. It wasn't Helix.

536
00:30:12,853 --> 00:30:13,854
We have a problem.

537
00:30:23,114 --> 00:30:24,657
Wait, this isn't A.R.G.U.S.

538
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:28,119
No, it is. Just not the site
A.R.G.U.S. expected us to hit.

539
00:30:30,997 --> 00:30:31,998
What problem?

540
00:30:32,206 --> 00:30:33,958
Helix is about to extract Cayden James.

541
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,166
- How? They're not here.
- Neither is Cayden James.

542
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:37,336
And you didn't tell us?

543
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,296
I didn't think it was necessary.

544
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:40,965
Where is he?

545
00:30:41,215 --> 00:30:44,468
At an off-the-books black site,
12 miles away.

546
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,108
Damn it, Lyla, you should've
let us in on the plan.

547
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:02,361
Helix wasn't supposed to know
about the black site. No one was.

548
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:03,738
That's because it's illegal.

549
00:31:03,946 --> 00:31:05,406
I'm not discussing this, Johnnie.

550
00:31:05,823 --> 00:31:08,159
Get your head in the game.
You're two minutes out.

551
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:24,026
Where has this tablet
been all my life?

552
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:26,927
I made it special for you.
So much better than a friendship bracelet.

553
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:33,458
How are we gonna find Cayden James?

554
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:35,203
I know he's inside
one of these containers,

555
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:36,455
but I don't know exactly which one.

556
00:31:36,479 --> 00:31:37,873
Can you check to see
if there's a site map?

557
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:38,898
Mmm-hmm.

558
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:40,608
Okay.

559
00:31:44,737 --> 00:31:47,257
Whatever A.R.G.U.S. is keeping in there,
they wanna keep secure.

560
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,783
Or whoever.

561
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:01,545
Two air-gapped, unhackable keys.
It's beautiful tech, really.

562
00:32:01,754 --> 00:32:03,881
Free Cayden James now.
Admire A.R.G.U.S. tech later.

563
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:05,091
Right.

564
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:12,181
- One...
- Two...

565
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:13,390
Three.

566
00:32:18,896 --> 00:32:19,939
Cayden?

567
00:32:24,485 --> 00:32:28,322
Hey. Hey. It's okay, this is a rescue.

568
00:32:28,531 --> 00:32:30,491
We gotta move.
Team Arrow will be here any minute.

569
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:32,654
I doubt that very much.
They have no clue we're here.

570
00:32:34,662 --> 00:32:37,206
Do not say "I told you so."
Meet us out back in five.

571
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:38,457
Where are we going?

572
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:40,603
We're gonna go say hi to your friends.

573
00:33:10,823 --> 00:33:13,023
Don't grab a woman
unless you have permission, dumb-ass.

574
00:33:17,872 --> 00:33:18,914
Freeze!

575
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,580
I've got Felicity's friend.

576
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,628
I have a name, you know.

577
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:27,798
Turn around. Put your hands on your head.

578
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:30,634
- Do it!
- Okay. Turning.

579
00:33:48,986 --> 00:33:50,426
You wanna see what else they can do?

580
00:33:55,326 --> 00:33:56,952
Next one goes in his head.

581
00:33:57,244 --> 00:33:59,830
Then it'll have to go through me. Go!

582
00:34:00,164 --> 00:34:01,290
Get out of the way!

583
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:05,211
You know I can't do that.
I was really hoping you wouldn't!

584
00:34:06,837 --> 00:34:08,005
Oliver, don't move.

585
00:34:09,256 --> 00:34:12,343
That is a 30-kilowatt spectral beam laser.
It'll cut you to the bone.

586
00:34:16,013 --> 00:34:17,431
Curtis will let you out.

587
00:34:22,353 --> 00:34:23,354
I'm sorry.

588
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:28,776
I am. I'm really hoping that you're gonna
understand after we get Chase.

589
00:34:32,947 --> 00:34:34,031
Don't count on it.

590
00:34:48,504 --> 00:34:50,381
On the bright side, we were suited up.

591
00:34:50,881 --> 00:34:53,300
I mean, I'm glad Cayden James
doesn't know that, you know,

592
00:34:53,509 --> 00:34:54,861
we were trying to keep him in prison.

593
00:34:54,885 --> 00:34:56,387
Because if he did, I would be scared

594
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:58,555
of my refrigerator, my car,
my alarm clock.

595
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:00,604
And could we talk
about elevators for a second?

596
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:03,185
Because I think I'm gonna be
taking the stairs for a while.

597
00:35:03,394 --> 00:35:05,896
It's just better for your health.

598
00:35:06,981 --> 00:35:09,525
Also, on the bright side, you know,
so, just think about that.

599
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:11,485
This wasn't a prison, Curtis.

600
00:35:11,694 --> 00:35:15,406
This was an illegal black site
on American soil led by my wife.

601
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:22,788
Also, no A.R.G.U.S. casualty...

602
00:35:22,997 --> 00:35:25,958
No A.R.G.U.S. casualties.
All the mercs used rubber bullets, so...

603
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:30,337
What do you wanna do about Felicity?

604
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:32,047
There is nothing to do.

605
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:38,512
She put herself in front of a bullet
in order to take down Chase.

606
00:35:39,722 --> 00:35:41,762
Until that happens,
I don't know what to say to her.

607
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:44,351
In the meantime,
we drink to her speedy success. I mean...

608
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,895
In the meantime, I think we go home.

609
00:35:47,271 --> 00:35:49,273
Why? There's more glasses in the bunk...

610
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:52,651
You wanna drink by your... Okay.
Yeah, right. I mean, yeah.

611
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,945
Thank you both very much for tonight.

612
00:36:11,879 --> 00:36:12,963
Yep.

613
00:36:13,172 --> 00:36:14,423
You're working late.

614
00:36:15,049 --> 00:36:17,509
Well, I thought I'd stick around
for my thank you.

615
00:36:17,885 --> 00:36:19,553
You had that coming, for sure.

616
00:36:20,429 --> 00:36:21,638
Along with an apology.

617
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:24,767
Here I was, thinking you didn't know
what an apology was.

618
00:36:26,143 --> 00:36:29,021
I guess you can
teach a dog some new tricks.

619
00:36:29,313 --> 00:36:30,314
Even wild ones.

620
00:36:32,274 --> 00:36:34,234
I spoke to Curtis' lawyer friend.

621
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:36,737
I put things in motion.

622
00:36:38,072 --> 00:36:39,156
Good for you.

623
00:36:40,324 --> 00:36:42,659
You know, that Zoe,
she's a hell of a little girl, and...

624
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:46,121
You know, she deserves her dad.

625
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,124
You know, father to father,

626
00:36:50,501 --> 00:36:51,710
I gotta tell you,

627
00:36:53,045 --> 00:36:55,339
her dad deserves to be with her.

628
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:57,299
Thank you.

629
00:36:58,926 --> 00:37:00,386
That's what I was waiting for.

630
00:37:02,763 --> 00:37:05,307
All right, how about
a celebratory club soda?

631
00:37:05,766 --> 00:37:06,934
I'm buying.

632
00:37:07,226 --> 00:37:09,978
Hey, hold on a second, hoss.
How about something stronger?

633
00:37:10,187 --> 00:37:12,773
You keep calling me "hoss,"
I'll show you something stronger.

634
00:37:19,363 --> 00:37:20,489
Hello?

635
00:37:23,492 --> 00:37:24,493
Hey, Felicity.

636
00:37:25,035 --> 00:37:27,746
Hi. Where are you? Are you okay?

637
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:31,667
We're safe.
Thank you for all of your help.

638
00:37:32,668 --> 00:37:35,003
But here's the thing.

639
00:37:35,212 --> 00:37:40,551
Your connection to the Green Arrow
and his team, it's a liability.

640
00:37:41,218 --> 00:37:44,596
Yeah. Well, once we get Chase,
he'll see all the good Helix can do.

641
00:37:45,514 --> 00:37:47,891
I'm sorry, but we just can't risk it.

642
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,787
Especially not with
Cayden back in the fold

643
00:37:50,811 --> 00:37:52,051
and A.R.G.U.S. looking for him.

644
00:37:53,313 --> 00:37:55,732
I loved getting to work with you.

645
00:37:57,109 --> 00:38:00,154
Meeting your heroes,
it turns out it's not so bad after all.

646
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:04,366
But we left something for you. Look down.

647
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:07,327
Up a little bit.

648
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:10,205
Little bit to the right.

649
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:11,790
This?

650
00:38:13,876 --> 00:38:14,877
What is it?

651
00:38:15,085 --> 00:38:17,337
Some on-the-fly coding from Mr. James.

652
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:20,757
Told you he was the best there ever was.

653
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:23,760
Take care, Felicity.

654
00:38:24,303 --> 00:38:25,387
Yeah, you, too.

655
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:44,907
Johnnie.

656
00:38:48,452 --> 00:38:50,120
We need to talk about this.

657
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:56,460
I don't think that's a good idea, Lyla.

658
00:38:58,587 --> 00:39:01,423
- I could say something I might regret.
- John.

659
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:03,926
When you said that you were
taking over for Waller,

660
00:39:04,218 --> 00:39:05,761
you said you wouldn't become her.

661
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:07,137
I told you.

662
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:10,441
It's more complicated when you're sitting
on the other side of the...

663
00:39:10,474 --> 00:39:11,659
What the hell is more complicated?

664
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:15,395
You're holding someone
with no lawyer, no trial, no justice.

665
00:39:15,604 --> 00:39:17,314
And the world is safer for it.

666
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:20,150
It could be safer.

667
00:39:24,905 --> 00:39:26,490
But it's not better.

668
00:39:28,325 --> 00:39:32,746
The woman I love could never do this.
Lyla, this job has changed you.

669
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:37,960
Maybe.

670
00:39:39,461 --> 00:39:41,129
But maybe the world's changed.

671
00:39:42,965 --> 00:39:44,424
It's gotten even worse, Johnnie.

672
00:39:44,633 --> 00:39:47,511
It's gotten worse and uglier,
and we do what we can

673
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:49,638
to protect the people we love.

674
00:39:51,682 --> 00:39:54,142
I am not ashamed of what I did.

675
00:39:55,769 --> 00:39:57,854
Of what I'm still going to do.

676
00:40:00,524 --> 00:40:02,693
We've been down this road before,
haven't we?

677
00:40:07,406 --> 00:40:08,907
We know where this fight takes us.

678
00:40:13,704 --> 00:40:15,080
So let's stop it.

679
00:40:17,207 --> 00:40:18,584
Move forward.

680
00:40:21,295 --> 00:40:22,879
I don't know if I can.

681
00:40:45,611 --> 00:40:46,987
- Is that it?
- Yep.

682
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:49,114
James' magic tracker to find Chase?

683
00:40:49,323 --> 00:40:51,867
Biometric tracker, yes.

684
00:40:52,242 --> 00:40:55,370
Nobody from A.R.G.U.S.
was seriously injured,

685
00:40:55,871 --> 00:40:56,951
in case you were wondering.

686
00:40:57,581 --> 00:40:58,749
Helix froze me out.

687
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:01,543
It's over.

688
00:41:02,044 --> 00:41:03,128
I'm sorry.

689
00:41:04,046 --> 00:41:06,298
I thought you weren't ever
gonna lie to me again.

690
00:41:08,008 --> 00:41:09,259
I'm not lying.

691
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,637
I'm sorry.

692
00:41:12,179 --> 00:41:15,515
I know that they gave you
a sense of belonging

693
00:41:15,724 --> 00:41:17,184
- that maybe I haven't...
- No.

694
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:20,520
You didn't back my play.

695
00:41:21,563 --> 00:41:23,273
I was worried.

696
00:41:23,482 --> 00:41:24,691
You don't trust me.

697
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:29,446
After all these years,
all of the times that I supported you,

698
00:41:29,655 --> 00:41:32,908
even when I didn't agree,
you couldn't do the same for me.

699
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:35,994
What's that?

700
00:41:37,496 --> 00:41:39,096
Tracker's honing in on Chase's location.

701
00:41:42,793 --> 00:41:43,919
Where is he?

702
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,048
Chase. He's here.

703
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:24,626
English - SDH
