1
00:00:58,225 --> 00:00:59,851
- Seq, I'm in.
- Captain.

2
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:02,187
You were right.
The skylight was a window pane.

3
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:03,480
I've got serious interference.

4
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:05,691
Weird. It's some kind of Modal.

5
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:07,651
Looks like old code.

6
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:09,111
It feels really familiar.

7
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:10,696
Drop a pin.
I'll signal for backup.

8
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:12,114
- I'm gonna check it out.
- Bugs?

9
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:13,740
If the general finds out
we've been fishing...

10
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,701
A quick peek can't hurt.

11
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,035
Did you hear that?

12
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,537
Shit. I think our signal was traced.

13
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:20,622
Bugs, this feels like a trap.

14
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:21,957
Bugs!

15
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:04,333
Freeze! Do not move!

16
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:05,500
We will shoot!

17
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:08,920
Very slowly, raise your hands.

18
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:24,269
Here we go.

19
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:31,360
Hey, where are you going?

20
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:32,986
You were warned, Lieutenant.

21
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,238
I think we can handle one little girl.

22
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:42,079
You're wasting your time!
My men are bringing her down now.

23
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,288
No, Lieutenant.

24
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,375
Your men are already dead.

25
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,220
Seq, you with me?

26
00:02:58,387 --> 00:02:59,429
This old code keeps crashing.

27
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,098
Your projection's breaking up.
Switch to audio.

28
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,767
Bugs, this is a direct violation
of the general's protocols.

29
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:07,020
I know, I know.
But something is happening here.

30
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,606
Something important.

31
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:10,857
Fuck.

32
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,442
We know what happens next.

33
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,236
She kicks their ass.

34
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:38,176
Now she makes a call.

35
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,386
The line was traced.

36
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,888
- And then...
- Then she runs for her life.

37
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,265
Are there any Agents?

38
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:44,766
We know this story.

39
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:47,936
This is how it all began.

40
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,063
God damn it.

41
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:51,732
This is where he began.

42
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:55,152
You're thinking this Modal is a loop?
Or a treadmill?

43
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:58,947
Some sort of sequencer
evolving a program to do what?

44
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,240
I don't know.

45
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,951
But I'm going to find out.

46
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:04,244
All right.

47
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,319
So déjà vu
and yet it's obviously all wrong.

48
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:39,446
Why use old code
to mirror something new?

49
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:40,989
I don't know.

50
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:57,547
If that's supposed to be Trinity,
that's not what happens.

51
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,551
Maybe this isn't the story
we think it is.

52
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,054
Bugs, you have to get out of here.

53
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,264
It's gotta be a trap.

54
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:08,725
Shit.

55
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,266
You all carry on.

56
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:50,725
As you were.

57
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,272
I'm just gonna...

58
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:57,566
see myself out.

59
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,025
Kill her.

60
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,936
Seq!

61
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,130
- Why did you save me?
- You first.

62
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,799
Who are you? Where did you come from?

63
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,008
Okay.

64
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:48,843
My name is Bugs.

65
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,721
As in "Bunny."

66
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,515
And tech that listens.

67
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:56,559
Do you know this is a Modal?

68
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:58,937
What's a Modal?

69
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:01,314
It's a simulation
used to evolve programs.

70
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,070
Do you understand that you are...

71
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,614
digital sentience?

72
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,408
I know what I am.

73
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:14,869
Just like I know my job is to hunt down
and destroy sentience...

74
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,246
like you.

75
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,960
And yet...

76
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:24,754
Here we are.

77
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,548
Here we are.

78
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,301
The other Agents
don't know about this room?

79
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:33,513
How'd you find it?

80
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,598
No one was ever in the key shop,

81
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,308
so I started looking.

82
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,562
More you looked, the more you found.

83
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,189
Story of my life.

84
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,322
What?

85
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:55,076
I feel like I know this room.

86
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:06,129
Holy shit.

87
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,008
This is his apartment.

88
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,136
You mean Thomas Anderson's?

89
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,430
I searched everywhere. He doesn't exist.

90
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:17,766
He stopped being Thomas a long time ago,

91
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,143
but maybe you know him by his real name.

92
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:21,978
Neo.

93
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,689
You do.

94
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:27,358
Okay.

95
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:32,155
I can't believe this,
after all these years.

96
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:35,784
You see, most people
think that Neo is dead.

97
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,536
But I know he's not.

98
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,247
Because I've seen him.

99
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,501
Where?

100
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,921
It's not something
I can explain easily, but...

101
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,178
But the moment he looked at me,

102
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,263
I felt something...

103
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,310
unlock my mind.

104
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:05,939
Okay.

105
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,193
Something like that happened to me.

106
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:16,783
I saw this pattern...

107
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,494
and it was everywhere.

108
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,623
We can't see it,
but we're all trapped inside

109
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,291
these strange, repeating loops.

110
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:29,087
Somehow, I saw it in the mirror.

111
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:32,298
Just a flicker,
but it was like you said.

112
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,764
And suddenly I understood.

113
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,725
This is not the real world.

114
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:48,523
For the first time,
I felt real purpose.

115
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:50,733
I knew who I was

116
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,153
and what I had to do.

117
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,238
Who are you?

118
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,283
What do you have to do?

119
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:02,537
I am...

120
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:04,706
Morpheus.

121
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,126
And I have to find Neo.

122
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:13,631
Morpheus.

123
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,178
Okay. Okay.

124
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,387
My God!

125
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:20,722
I have to get you out of here.

126
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:23,016
I need to figure out
who built this Modal.

127
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,018
Okay, come with me.

128
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,145
You have to be ready to leave.
You have to be really ready.

129
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,313
And if you're not,

130
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,606
if you think that
this is where you belong...

131
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,402
You call this a choice?

132
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:36,196
Honestly, when somebody
offered me these things,

133
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,780
I went off on
binary conceptions of the world

134
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,532
and said there was no way
I was swallowing

135
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,409
some symbolic reduction of my life.

136
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,953
And the woman with the pills laughed
'cause I was missing the point.

137
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,663
What point?

138
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,832
The choice is an illusion.

139
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,919
You already know what you have to do.

140
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:58,760
Truth.

141
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:06,476
Okay.

142
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:09,395
There's an old building
with a skylight and lots of stairs.

143
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,730
The Lafayette.

144
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,357
One of the four back doors leads there.

145
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:15,693
- Don't fight it.
- Whoa, what's happening?

146
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:17,028
Keep breathing.

147
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:20,531
Extraction works pretty much the same
for humans and programs.

148
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:24,369
Ouch.

149
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,206
Okay.

150
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,252
- Hey.
- Hey.

151
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,087
I've never worn
different glasses before.

152
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,256
Yeah, looks good. Which door?

153
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,758
- It's gotta be...
- Okay.

154
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,181
Agent White.

155
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,808
Agent Smith?

156
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,982
Go!

157
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,865
Seq! Can you hear me?

158
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,284
Bugs! I thought I lost you.

159
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,493
Can you get us to the window pane?

160
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,578
Bugs! Bugs! He's an Agent!

161
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,008
That window! Go hard!

162
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,681
What the...

163
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,731
What the hell?

164
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:34,832
Something wrong?

165
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,585
Just a little crash.

166
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:40,171
Morning, Bobbi. Morning, dude.

167
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:43,758
What a beautiful day to be alive.
Am I right?

168
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,386
- Problemo?
- He lost something.

169
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,013
Is this old Matrix code?

170
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:52,683
A little Modal experiment.

171
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,644
For Binary?

172
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,398
- I need a coffee.
- Coffee. Yes, stat!

173
00:14:58,481 --> 00:14:59,565
I'm buying.

174
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:04,487
I'm not trying to
blow smoke up your ass,

175
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:08,241
but the first time I played the trilogy,
I was shook.

176
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,494
The paradox
between free will and destiny.

177
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:14,038
Are we all just algorithms
doing what we're supposed to do,

178
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,957
or can we escape our programming?

179
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:19,085
Genius, inside the context of the game,
BT dubs.

180
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,130
Hey, did I tell you
it took over my life?

181
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,590
Yeah. I failed the seventh grade.

182
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,384
Your game almost ruined me.

183
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,846
- So you've said.
- Yet here we are.

184
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,598
You tell me, Mr. Anderson,

185
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:33,724
is it free will

186
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,602
or destiny?

187
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:42,942
Yeah.

188
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,735
There she is.

189
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,779
Total f-ing MILF.

190
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,699
Daggers. Look, I'm sorry.

191
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:52,118
I'm a geek. I was raised by machines.

192
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,494
Maybe you should go.

193
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:56,539
No, please. I... I promise, best self.

194
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:57,915
Best self.

195
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:03,087
Sure.

196
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,381
You ever talk to her?

197
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,551
Tell you what.

198
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:12,930
For all you've done for me,
let me do this for you.

199
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,391
Jude, no. Stop.

200
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:17,935
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Thanks.

201
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,604
Hi. Um...

202
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,523
I know this is all a bit extemporaneous.
I'm Jude Gallagher.

203
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:25,568
I work for a game company
called Deus Machina.

204
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,028
Hi, Jude, I'm Tiffany.

205
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:29,989
Tiffany. Wow. Didn't see that coming.

206
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:32,074
- Mom loved Audrey Hepburn.
- Jude.

207
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:35,995
And this is my very good friend,
Thomas Anderson.

208
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,914
He is a bona fide famous person

209
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,582
and considered by most to be

210
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,459
the greatest game designer
of our generation.

211
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:42,793
I'm sorry about this.

212
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,086
- Jude...
- Just talk to her.

213
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,631
Hi, Thomas. Everyone calls me Tiff.

214
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:48,716
Hi.

215
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,016
Have we met?

216
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,686
We both come here.

217
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,313
- Can I have your morning bun?
- Hey.

218
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:03,648
Are you trying to ball my mom or what?

219
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,107
Brandon!

220
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,026
Can I have one bite?

221
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:10,029
Babe. What's going on?
We're gonna be late.

222
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,073
This is my husband, Chad.

223
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,908
- Nice to meet you.
- Hey.

224
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,578
Babe, we gotta get Callie to practice.

225
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,539
Right. Sorry.

226
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:21,499
Come on, kids. Let's move out.

227
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:46,941
What?

228
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,659
Sorry. It's the boss.

229
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:05,668
"Billions of people
just living out their lives,

230
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,713
oblivious."

231
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,508
I always loved that line.

232
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,594
You wrote that one, yeah?

233
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:19,140
Every time I stand here,

234
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:22,560
I mean, O-M-G.

235
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,937
It's so perfect, it's gotta be fake.

236
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,398
Right?

237
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:30,526
Yeah.

238
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,445
Sure.

239
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,447
Have a seat.

240
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:38,659
Smoke?

241
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:40,995
I thought you quit.

242
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,414
I quit calling it a habit.

243
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,250
Now it's just a guilty pleasure.

244
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:51,339
Maybe I can make this easy for you.

245
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,300
I know Binary is over budget.

246
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,510
This is not about Binary, Tom.
It's bigger than that.

247
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,137
This is about our future,

248
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,431
which is a sticky subject,
given our past.

249
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,266
What do you mean?

250
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:04,727
How's the therapy?

251
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:06,354
Good.

252
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:08,522
Any...

253
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:10,816
episodes?

254
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:13,694
No.

255
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:16,113
That's terrific.

256
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:20,701
Look, Tom,
I know we've always had our differences.

257
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,329
What did you say
about our first meeting?

258
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:26,332
We had all the chemistry
of an FBI interrogation.

259
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:30,711
But look at this place.

260
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,130
We did this.

261
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:35,716
Together.

262
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:38,469
Yeah.

263
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:39,845
Now what?

264
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,349
Things have changed. The market's tough.

265
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:45,768
I'm sure you can understand

266
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,187
why our beloved parent company,
Warner Bros.,

267
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,606
has decided to make a sequel
to the trilogy.

268
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:51,732
What?

269
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,859
They informed me
they're gonna do it with or without us.

270
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,861
I thought they couldn't do that.

271
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,614
They can.

272
00:19:58,781 --> 00:19:59,782
And they made it clear

273
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,867
they'll kill our contract
if we don't cooperate.

274
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:03,411
Really?

275
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:07,206
I know you said
the story was over for you,

276
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,292
but that's the thing about stories.

277
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,796
They never really end, do they?

278
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,757
We're still telling the same stories
we've always told,

279
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:21,011
just with different names,
different faces

280
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:25,725
and I have to say I'm kind of excited.

281
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:29,895
After all these years,

282
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:32,148
to be going back
to where it all started.

283
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:35,234
Back to The Matrix.

284
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:38,237
I've spoken to Marketing...

285
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:45,202
Tom?

286
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:46,704
Yeah.

287
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,372
Are you all right?

288
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:51,792
Yeah.

289
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,924
What were you feeling
at that point?

290
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,804
What was I feeling?

291
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:11,687
I felt either I'm having
a mental breakdown again

292
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:16,192
or I'm living inside
a computer-generated reality

293
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,818
that has imprisoned me...

294
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:19,612
again.

295
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:31,707
Not much of a choice.

296
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:32,875
No.

297
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:34,835
Maybe it's not as binary as that.

298
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:38,130
Maybe there are other ways
to understand what happened.

299
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:39,757
Yeah.

300
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:42,134
Thomas, you are a suicide survivor

301
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,012
gifted with a powerful imagination.

302
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,014
Those facts have combined

303
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:49,517
to create dangerous fictions
in your life.

304
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:52,269
Yesterday, you walked into a meeting
with your business partner

305
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:53,604
and he ambushed you,

306
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:56,440
demanding you make a game
you said you would never make.

307
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:59,360
This attack
effectively took away your voice.

308
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:02,655
His violence triggered you
and your mind fought back.

309
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,532
You did to him
what he was doing to you.

310
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:10,329
We've talked about the value
of adaptive anger in healing trauma.

311
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:14,500
Far from suggesting
a repeat of your initial breakdown,

312
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:17,670
I believe this episode
demonstrates healthy self-protection.

313
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:20,589
And more importantly,

314
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:23,843
I remember how hard it was
for you to share something like this.

315
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:27,346
Which tells me just how far we've come.

316
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:34,687
Do you need a refill
on your prescription?

317
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:37,773
Yeah.

318
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,673
First of all,
I know I speak for everyone

319
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,092
when I say that I'm so, so excited

320
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:08,762
to be working on a game
that was such a, well, game changer.

321
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:13,726
Now, the packet in front of you
has our focus group research.

322
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:15,311
Inside, you'll find the breakdown,

323
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:18,397
including key word association
with the brand.

324
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:21,609
The top two
being "originality" and "fresh,"

325
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,652
which I think are great things
to keep in mind

326
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:25,905
as you begin working on Matrix 4.

327
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:29,033
And who knows how many more?

328
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,843
What made Matrix different?
It effed with your head.

329
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:49,219
On point.

330
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:51,513
People want us up in their grey space,

331
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,183
switching their synaptic WTF light on.

332
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:07,112
What made Matrix different?
It effed with your head.

333
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,948
People want us up in their grey space,

334
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,324
switching their synaptic

335
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:13,077
"What the hell is going on here?"
light on.

336
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:27,508
I didn't love the first one,
like some of you.

337
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:30,052
And, frankly, I've got zero tolerance

338
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:32,471
for anything that requires
a syllabus and a highlighter.

339
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:34,348
I like my games big, loud and dumb.

340
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:36,392
We need guns! Lots of guns.

341
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:39,061
Matrix means mayhem.

342
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,943
Mindless action is not on-brand.

343
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,027
She's right.

344
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:50,531
Matrix is mind porn.
Philosophy in shiny,

345
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:52,241
- tight PVC.
- Yeah.

346
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,243
Ideas are the new sexy.

347
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:10,217
Obviously The Matrix is about...

348
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,386
- trans-politics.
- Crypto-fascism.

349
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:13,554
It's a metaphor...

350
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,180
of capitalist exploitation.

351
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:32,031
This cannot be another reboot,
retread, regurgitated...

352
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,199
Why not? Reboots sell.

353
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:39,496
We are so far down
the wrong rabbit hole here, people.

354
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:42,708
You say Matrix to anyone...
You say Matrix...

355
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,378
Matrix... Matrix... Matrix...

356
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,380
this is what they see.

357
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,181
Allow me to sum up our goal
in a single word.

358
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:59,433
Bullet time! Bullet time!

359
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:01,143
That's two words.

360
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:08,317
We need a new "bullet time."

361
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:14,865
We need to revolutionize gaming again.

362
00:26:15,032 --> 00:26:18,702
Revolutionize gaming again!

363
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,271
Afternoon, Tiff.

364
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,439
The ushe?

365
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,900
You know what, Skroce? I'm going wild.

366
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:51,985
I'll have a cortado today.

367
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,446
Fly that freak flag.

368
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:56,865
Mind if I get that?

369
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,033
Hi.

370
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,285
Hi.

371
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,247
I remember wanting a family,

372
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:06,834
but was that because
that's what women are supposed to want?

373
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,711
How do you know
if you want something yourself

374
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,422
or if your upbringing
programmed you to want it?

375
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:19,138
I pay my analyst a lot of money
to answer such questions for me.

376
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:20,806
Smart.

377
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:24,226
I should get more therapy
but honestly, I'm too goddamn tired.

378
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,436
Kids are exhausting, you know?

379
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:30,274
No. Never had kids.

380
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,901
Right, I knew that.

381
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,654
Sorry. I googled you.

382
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:40,200
So, what's it like
being a world-famous game designer?

383
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,828
Must be amazing.

384
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:44,371
A lot of hours.

385
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:46,498
Sometimes it is amazing.

386
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,125
Most times,

387
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,544
I don't know.

388
00:27:50,711 --> 00:27:53,297
But you made The Matrix.
Even I've heard of that.

389
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:56,383
Yeah. We kept some kids entertained.

390
00:27:57,301 --> 00:27:59,303
So, worth it?

391
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:08,145
Can I ask something about your game?

392
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:09,521
Sure.

393
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,899
Did you base your main character
on yourself?

394
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:19,072
There is a lot of me in him.

395
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:24,703
Maybe a little too much.

396
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,373
Can I ask you something else?

397
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,750
Please.

398
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:33,754
There's a woman in your game.

399
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:35,964
Trinity.

400
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,552
Which is a weird
coincidence also, right?

401
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,222
God, yeah.

402
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,849
I like her.

403
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,852
I like Trinity.

404
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:50,729
And I dig her Ducati.

405
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:53,774
Another coincidence. I love motorcycles.

406
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:59,696
My friend Kush and I
actually build them.

407
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:00,864
Really?

408
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:03,533
You have your analyst, I have my bikes.

409
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:07,496
So, I was looking at images
from your game.

410
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,164
At Trinity.

411
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:14,586
Well, I showed Chad a scene,
and I was like, "So, what do you think?"

412
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:17,631
He didn't get it until I said,

413
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,259
"Don't you think she looks like me?"

414
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:23,804
You know what he did?

415
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,390
He laughed.

416
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,981
And I laughed too, like it was a joke.

417
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:35,607
How could it not be, right?

418
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,444
Made me so angry.

419
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:43,282
I hated myself for laughing.

420
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:48,036
I wanted to kick him so hard.

421
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:50,455
Not too hard.

422
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:53,709
Maybe just hard enough
to break his jaw off.

423
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,047
And right now,
you're probably regretting

424
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:00,549
sitting down with me.

425
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:06,305
This is the best thing I've done
in a long time.

426
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,686
I have to take this.

427
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:17,357
Hi, this is Tiff.

428
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:18,608
God, no.

429
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,112
I'll be right there.

430
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:25,532
My... My, youngest
stuck a Lego up his nose.

431
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:30,162
I gotta go.

432
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:34,958
I hope I see you again.

433
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,395
There has been a report of an emergency.

434
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:59,691
Proceed calmly to the nearest exit
and leave the building immediately.

435
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,109
What's going on?

436
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,195
We probably just got swatted
by some 14-year-old.

437
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:04,821
Yeah, someone pissed
about the latest update.

438
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:05,947
Or they're just a dick.

439
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:09,201
Please move to the exits.
Building's being evacuated.

440
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:32,057
Sir, this way.

441
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,064
Jude?

442
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:41,650
Jude!

443
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:50,075
At last.

444
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:56,540
I wasn't too sure about the callback,
but, you know, it was hard to resist.

445
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:57,916
What?

446
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,543
Morpheus Uno. Reveal at the window.

447
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,962
Lightning, thunder and theater.

448
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:03,672
At last.

449
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:08,427
All these years later, here's me,
strolling out of a toilet stall.

450
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:10,011
Tragedy or farce?

451
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,847
I know you.

452
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,807
Not every day you meet your maker.

453
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:15,100
This can't be happening.

454
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:16,935
Most definitely is.

455
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:19,354
You can't be a character I coded.

456
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:21,523
One hundred percent natural.

457
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:30,031
How?

458
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:32,451
All the explanation you need.

459
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:38,498
No.

460
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,542
No, no, no.

461
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,419
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What do you mean, "no"?

462
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:45,172
You wanted this, you did this.
This was your idea.

463
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:49,384
It was a test.
An experiment.

464
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:51,887
An experiment?

465
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:55,390
You put me in a tiny-ass Modal,

466
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:56,725
left me to bang my head

467
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,144
till I nearly lost my shit
searching for you,

468
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:00,937
as an experiment.

469
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,856
- The exit's breaking down.
- He hasn't taken the pill.

470
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:04,357
What? There's no time.

471
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:06,193
I know, I know. He's having a moment.

472
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:08,278
Does he know
how hard it was to hack that mirror?

473
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:12,365
Still open.

474
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:16,536
This... This can't be real.

475
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,330
Target acquired.
We got him.

476
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,297
This isn't happening.

477
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:29,925
It's in my mind. It's in my mind.

478
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,092
Hey, you!
Stop! Hold it!

479
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:48,735
This can't be happening.

480
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:53,615
Freeze! Don't move!

481
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:03,708
Neo!

482
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,016
My God!

483
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:55,844
Neo!

484
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:02,934
Mr. Anderson!

485
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:04,978
No.

486
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:06,146
It can't be.

487
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:16,781
I've missed you.

488
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:33,715
It's in my mind.

489
00:35:34,883 --> 00:35:36,217
It's in my mind.

490
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:45,894
Can you hear me, Thomas?

491
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:49,189
Follow my voice.

492
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:53,777
Feel the tips of your fingers.
What are they touching?

493
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:57,155
The bell.

494
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:01,076
Do you hear the bell?

495
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:07,540
Do you remember what happened?
How you got here?

496
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,460
You must have walked.

497
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:13,088
I heard Déjà Vu outside,
opened my door, and there you were.

498
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:20,804
You feel like you can talk about it?

499
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:22,639
When we started working together,

500
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:27,185
you had lost your capacity
to discern reality from fiction.

501
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:30,063
You came to me
after trying to jump off a building.

502
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,691
You said you wanted to fly away.

503
00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:48,915
We have made
a lot of progress since then,

504
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:51,292
but you seem
particularly triggered right now.

505
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,752
Can you tell me how it started?

506
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:56,464
He texted me.

507
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:58,925
Who?

508
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:00,510
Morpheus.

509
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:04,764
So, he's back.

510
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:07,016
It wasn't actually him.

511
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:10,937
It was a program I coded for a Modal.

512
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:13,732
And this Modal, Morpheus,

513
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:16,025
came to help you escape

514
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:19,529
from a virtual reality
called The Matrix?

515
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:30,999
Am I crazy?

516
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:33,501
We don't use that word in here.

517
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:36,129
What word should I use?

518
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:40,467
What word explains
what is happening to me?

519
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:42,343
Can I see the texts?

520
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:46,347
They were erased.

521
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:54,981
If we got in my car
and drove to your office,

522
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:56,900
what do you think we'd find there?

523
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,109
Nothing.

524
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,906
Because there was no attack.

525
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:05,700
No one was killed.

526
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,203
No one texted.

527
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:10,872
My mind made it all up.

528
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:14,542
Is that what I'm supposed to say?

529
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,544
Is that what you believe?

530
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:18,755
It felt real.

531
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,632
Of course.

532
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:24,260
It was your great ambition
to make a game

533
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:26,429
that was indistinguishable from reality.

534
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:27,680
To achieve this goal,

535
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:30,558
you converted elements of your life
into narrative.

536
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:32,936
Your sublimated anger toward
your business partner

537
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:34,729
cast him as your nemesis.

538
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:39,901
A married woman named Tiffany
became the Trinity of a doomed romance.

539
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:44,030
Even your dislike of my cat
made it into your Matrix.

540
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:46,491
There's nothing wrong with that.

541
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,117
It's what artists do.

542
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,245
But it becomes a problem

543
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:53,915
when fantasies
endanger us or other people.

544
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,503
We don't want anyone to get hurt,

545
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,004
do we, Thomas?

546
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:10,014
Hi, Thomas. Everyone calls me Tiff.

547
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,392
- Who are you?
- My name is Trinity.

548
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,602
No one can tell you
you're in love.

549
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:16,980
You just know it, through and through.

550
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:19,107
Balls to bones.

551
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:21,484
You feel this?

552
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:24,904
I'm never letting go.

553
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,622
You have to
let it all go, Neo.

554
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:37,083
Free your mind.

555
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:59,397
Looks easy enough.

556
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:08,865
"Free my mind." Shit.

557
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:15,496
Okay.

558
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:17,582
Free my mind.

559
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,350
I fly...

560
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:37,727
or I fall.

561
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:47,236
Who the hell are you?

562
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:50,281
You won't remember me,

563
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,909
but a long time ago, you changed my life

564
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:55,620
when you leapt off another roof.

565
00:40:56,329 --> 00:40:59,082
Back then,
I was just like any other coppertop,

566
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:00,583
pretending my life

567
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,295
until I looked up and I saw you.

568
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:07,590
It was a different you, but I saw

569
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:09,467
the real you,

570
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,011
just a second before...

571
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:14,597
you leapt.

572
00:41:19,352 --> 00:41:21,104
And you never fell.

573
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:28,569
Are you the one that hacked my Modal?

574
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,238
Yeah.

575
00:41:31,698 --> 00:41:34,450
That'll be Jude. He's not your friend.

576
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:36,244
He's a handle,
a program used to control you.

577
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:39,205
He's on his way here,
and he's bringing Agents with him.

578
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:41,749
Jude.

579
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:45,211
Bro, I've been calling you all night.
We have a major problemo.

580
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:48,339
Are you alone?

581
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,219
That's kind of a sexy question, dude.

582
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,347
They don't look like
typical Agents.

583
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:57,849
They use bots now,
skinned as normal people,

584
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:00,601
which means they're everywhere
and you never know who to trust.

585
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:03,146
Why should I trust you?

586
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,359
Because if they open that door,
we lose our hack.

587
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,111
I will be caught and killed

588
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:12,655
and you will be put right back
on that treadmill they designed for you

589
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:15,199
just like they did the last time
you tried to leap your way out.

590
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:19,078
I know why you left your Modal open.

591
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:21,372
You needed someone else
to free Morpheus.

592
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:23,708
And it's because of him
that we were able to get to you.

593
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:27,545
I know these things the same way
that I knew one day I would find you.

594
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:31,132
And that when I did,
you would be ready for this.

595
00:42:35,845 --> 00:42:37,096
If you want the truth, Neo,

596
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:40,349
you're going to have to follow me.

597
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:42,894
Okay.

598
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:05,166
- Where are we?
- Tokyo.

599
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:07,085
A moving portal
makes it harder to track us.

600
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,629
- Seq is the best of them.
- Portal's clean.

601
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:11,172
Reading no shadows.

602
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:14,342
I don't remember this.

603
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:17,595
We don't have to run
to phone booths anymore either.

604
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:28,606
Door's on your right.

605
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:45,164
Set and setting, right?

606
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:46,582
No.

607
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:48,126
It's all about set...

608
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,294
and setting.

609
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:54,465
After our first contact went so badly,
we thought elements from your past

610
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,008
might help ease you into the present.

611
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:58,845
Nothing comforts anxiety like

612
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:00,471
a little nostalgia.

613
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,807
This is footage from your game.

614
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:12,024
Time is always against us,

615
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:14,944
etcetera, etcetera.

616
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:20,658
No one can be told what the Matrix is,
blah, blah, blah.

617
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:25,204
You gotta see it to believe it.

618
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:29,876
Time to fly.

619
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:33,880
Wait.

620
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:35,047
If this is real,

621
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:37,967
if I haven't lost my mind,
does that mean

622
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:41,053
this happened?

623
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:51,522
But if it did,

624
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:57,153
then we died.

625
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,238
Obviously not.

626
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:00,823
Why the Machines kept you alive

627
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:03,743
and why they went
to such lengths to hide you

628
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:05,494
are questions we don't have answers to.

629
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:06,954
Hide me?

630
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:11,209
I've been at a company making
a game called The Matrix.

631
00:45:11,918 --> 00:45:14,420
Doesn't seem like
they were trying to hide anything.

632
00:45:14,587 --> 00:45:16,088
We've been tracking
that company for years.

633
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:18,799
We screened
every Thomas Anderson we found.

634
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:22,678
What we didn't understand
was that they could alter your DSI.

635
00:45:23,304 --> 00:45:25,056
Pods generate your digital self-image

636
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:27,558
through a feedback system
called Semblance.

637
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:29,101
This is how you look to yourself.

638
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:32,730
Somehow they were able
to alter your DSI loop.

639
00:45:33,606 --> 00:45:35,483
This is how everyone else sees you.

640
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:51,999
Twenty years?

641
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:56,921
Why did it take 20 years to find me?

642
00:45:57,088 --> 00:45:58,881
It took a lot longer than that.

643
00:45:59,048 --> 00:46:01,008
It's been over 60 years
since you and Trinity

644
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:02,677
flew to one of the Machine Cities.

645
00:46:03,386 --> 00:46:04,387
What?

646
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:06,264
There's so much we don't know.

647
00:46:06,806 --> 00:46:08,641
Like why you've barely aged,

648
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:10,851
or how many times
they've altered your DSI.

649
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,228
But based on what we do know,

650
00:46:12,395 --> 00:46:15,231
it appears no one found you
because you didn't want to be found.

651
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:18,109
- That's not true.
- Maybe it isn't.

652
00:46:18,526 --> 00:46:20,903
Maybe there's no foundation
to the rumors that you disappeared

653
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:22,530
because you were
working with the Machines

654
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:23,614
from the beginning.

655
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:24,949
Morpheus, stop.

656
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:28,160
All I'm saying is this is the moment

657
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:30,663
for you to show us what is real.

658
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:32,623
If you want out,

659
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:34,458
you'll take this pill.

660
00:46:36,085 --> 00:46:38,337
But if you are where you belong,

661
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:40,589
you can go back to this.

662
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:42,049
Every day.

663
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:45,761
Over and over, forever.

664
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:50,433
Fuck.

665
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:01,652
Keep the loop tight.

666
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:15,291
Cybebe needs that tower pin.

667
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:17,209
I got a signal. It's faint.

668
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:18,753
It's definitely off-grid.

669
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:28,095
Captain. I'm tracking
a whole lot of weird.

670
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:29,597
- What?
- It's some kind of graft.

671
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:37,146
Thomas?

672
00:47:38,314 --> 00:47:40,107
God.

673
00:47:40,733 --> 00:47:42,234
No.

674
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:45,946
- We got company.
- How'd they find us?

675
00:47:47,365 --> 00:47:50,284
Thomas, none of this is real.

676
00:47:50,451 --> 00:47:53,662
You are in the midst
of a serious psychotic break.

677
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,499
- Lexy?
- Almost there.

678
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:57,875
Thomas?

679
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:01,629
Thomas, please. This is not a game.

680
00:48:01,796 --> 00:48:03,255
Feel my hand.

681
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:04,548
This is what is real.

682
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:09,136
Stay with me.

683
00:48:09,512 --> 00:48:11,055
No. No.

684
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,184
Stay with me.

685
00:48:17,812 --> 00:48:18,813
Neo!

686
00:48:22,525 --> 00:48:23,526
Morpheus!

687
00:48:25,194 --> 00:48:26,487
Let's go, let's go!

688
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:58,978
- Bots are being activated.
- It's a swarm.

689
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,295
Come on!

690
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,079
I got a hack in the bathroom. Hurry.

691
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:00,247
Yes.

692
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,041
Come on!

693
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:05,127
Seq, where?

694
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:10,424
- That mirror.
- What? We'll never fit.

695
00:50:10,508 --> 00:50:12,176
You gotta fit, 'cause I don't have
another way off this train.

696
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:13,302
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

697
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:15,846
I know. I know.

698
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:18,974
Think perspective.
Closer you are, bigger it gets.

699
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:24,188
Okay, come on.

700
00:50:25,481 --> 00:50:26,690
In you go.

701
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:22,848
Trinity.

702
00:52:28,187 --> 00:52:29,188
No.

703
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:53,021
Welcome back
to the real world.

704
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:02,656
Trinity.

705
00:54:02,823 --> 00:54:03,699
What's up, Doc?

706
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:05,492
His vital systems
have been meticulously maintained,

707
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:07,453
but it doesn't look good.

708
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,210
- We're losing him.
- Cold boot could shock him.

709
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:16,795
Do it.

710
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:31,435
I remember this.

711
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:35,647
The Construct.

712
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:39,026
In between everything

713
00:54:39,193 --> 00:54:40,652
and nothing.

714
00:54:41,445 --> 00:54:43,030
Welcome to the Crib.

715
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:46,658
I've been chilling here
in the ship network,

716
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,663
learning all about you.

717
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:57,503
And me.

718
00:55:01,465 --> 00:55:04,009
Careful. It'll do your head in.

719
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:08,806
Are memories turned into fiction
any less real?

720
00:55:12,184 --> 00:55:15,312
Is reality based in memory
nothing but fiction?

721
00:55:15,479 --> 00:55:17,105
As to my role in all this,

722
00:55:17,189 --> 00:55:19,775
my best guess is that you wrote me

723
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:22,069
as an algorithmic reflection
of two forces

724
00:55:22,236 --> 00:55:24,363
that helped you become you,

725
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:27,741
Morpheus and Agent Smith.

726
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:31,995
A combo pack of counterprogramming
that was...

727
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:37,668
Let's just say,
more than a little bit crazy-making.

728
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:41,630
But it worked because here we are.

729
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:44,299
Now, for the bad news.

730
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:46,677
Your brain is hooked on this shit

731
00:55:46,844 --> 00:55:49,471
The Matrix has been force-feeding you
for years.

732
00:55:49,638 --> 00:55:51,348
Hooked bad.

733
00:55:51,515 --> 00:55:52,975
You're going through major withdrawals.

734
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:55,477
Docbots are giving you crap odds
for surviving.

735
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:58,480
But, see, they don't know you like I do.

736
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:03,569
I know exactly what you need.

737
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:26,925
You gotta be kidding.

738
00:56:29,261 --> 00:56:30,554
No joke.

739
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:34,641
Could be this is the first day
of the rest of your life.

740
00:56:35,434 --> 00:56:37,185
But if you want it...

741
00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:42,149
You gotta fight for it.

742
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:46,236
No. I'm done fighting.

743
00:56:47,279 --> 00:56:48,280
Are you?

744
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:33,033
What the hell is he doing?

745
00:57:34,326 --> 00:57:36,995
Yeah. They taught you good.

746
00:57:42,668 --> 00:57:45,796
Made you believe
their world was all you deserved.

747
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:47,839
But some part of you knew
that was a lie.

748
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:50,550
Some part of you
remembered what was real.

749
00:57:53,345 --> 00:57:54,471
You don't know me.

750
00:57:55,097 --> 00:57:56,098
No?

751
00:58:02,104 --> 00:58:03,105
Ooh.

752
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:39,808
I know you,

753
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:42,060
because I know the only thing
that still matters to you.

754
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:45,147
I know it's why you're here,
why you're still fighting

755
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:47,399
and why you will never give up.

756
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:02,873
Come on, Neo!

757
00:59:04,332 --> 00:59:05,500
This is it.

758
00:59:07,711 --> 00:59:09,087
This is your last chance.

759
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:19,890
You gotta fight for your goddamn life
if you want to see Trinity again.

760
00:59:25,062 --> 00:59:26,354
Come on, Neo! Fight for her!

761
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:31,610
- Holy shit.
- Fight for her!

762
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:25,372
- Hey.
- Hey.

763
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:28,792
Mind if I...

764
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:43,473
How are you doing?

765
01:00:45,142 --> 01:00:47,144
If this plug is actually real,

766
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:51,439
that means they took my life...

767
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:56,361
And turned it into a video game.

768
01:00:59,573 --> 01:01:01,116
How am I doing?

769
01:01:02,117 --> 01:01:03,410
I don't know.

770
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:06,371
I don't even know how to know.

771
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:08,957
That's it, isn't it?

772
01:01:10,584 --> 01:01:12,669
If we don't know what's real,

773
01:01:14,796 --> 01:01:15,881
we can't resist.

774
01:01:18,884 --> 01:01:20,260
They took your story,

775
01:01:20,427 --> 01:01:21,845
something that meant

776
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:25,182
so much to people like me,

777
01:01:26,975 --> 01:01:29,477
and turned it into something trivial.

778
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:33,064
That's what the Matrix does.

779
01:01:33,982 --> 01:01:36,109
It weaponizes every idea.

780
01:01:36,902 --> 01:01:38,278
Every dream.

781
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:41,573
Everything that's important to us.

782
01:01:44,284 --> 01:01:45,368
Where better to bury truth

783
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:48,914
than inside something
as ordinary as a video game?

784
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:51,583
That sounds like the Oracle.

785
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:54,753
Heard so much about her.

786
01:01:57,672 --> 01:01:59,090
She was gone before I was free.

787
01:02:00,759 --> 01:02:01,760
Gone?

788
01:02:01,927 --> 01:02:05,055
When this new version of the Matrix
was uploaded,

789
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,099
there was a purge.

790
01:02:13,188 --> 01:02:16,733
They promised peace
and they gave us purge.

791
01:02:18,193 --> 01:02:19,236
No.

792
01:02:19,778 --> 01:02:21,446
No, there was peace.

793
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:27,244
You made it possible,
and it changed everything.

794
01:02:28,203 --> 01:02:30,872
Doesn't feel like it changed anything.

795
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:34,334
The Matrix is the same or worse.

796
01:02:35,085 --> 01:02:37,170
And I'm back where I started.

797
01:02:40,048 --> 01:02:42,384
It feels like everything I did,

798
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:44,928
everything we did...

799
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:53,144
like none of it mattered.

800
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:57,023
All of it mattered.

801
01:02:58,817 --> 01:03:00,277
I can show you.

802
01:03:10,996 --> 01:03:12,539
This is my crew.

803
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:17,836
Our operator, Seq.

804
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:23,550
Sequoia. But everybody calls me Seq.

805
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,468
Nice to meet you.

806
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:28,096
Dad loved redwoods.

807
01:03:28,722 --> 01:03:31,599
When he escaped the Matrix
and found out they no longer existed,

808
01:03:31,683 --> 01:03:32,767
it almost killed him.

809
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:34,394
Lucky he met Mom,

810
01:03:35,312 --> 01:03:36,396
and here I am.

811
01:03:37,105 --> 01:03:40,692
This is Lexy, Berg and Ellster.

812
01:03:41,443 --> 01:03:42,610
Hi.

813
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:45,280
You knew my grandfather, Captain Roland.

814
01:03:45,447 --> 01:03:47,782
Roland was your grandfather?

815
01:03:48,616 --> 01:03:50,702
He always laughed,
joking how he never believed in you.

816
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:55,040
But, in private, he said
that you freed his mind a second time.

817
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:57,751
Not to fanboy out here,

818
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:59,753
but this is kind of
a huge moment for me.

819
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:01,796
Berg is our resident Neo-ologist.

820
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:03,631
A what?

821
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:06,843
There's a lot of people
out there like me

822
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:09,137
who are a little bit obsessed
with your life.

823
01:04:09,304 --> 01:04:11,598
I would never have recognized your Modal
if it weren't for him.

824
01:04:11,765 --> 01:04:14,976
Whenever you're feeling up for it,
I've got, like, a million questions.

825
01:04:15,143 --> 01:04:17,479
Me too. Starting with them.

826
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:19,856
It's okay.

827
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:21,649
Come meet him.

828
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:23,193
This is Cybebe.

829
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:24,778
That's Octacles.

830
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:26,946
That's Lumin8.

831
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:29,824
Machines are on our side now?

832
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:32,952
They are synthients.
It's a word they prefer to Machines.

833
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:36,456
Your contact with the Synthient City
had a huge impact on their world.

834
01:04:36,915 --> 01:04:37,916
That's what I meant.

835
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:40,960
What you changed that nobody believed
could ever be changed.

836
01:04:43,004 --> 01:04:45,131
The meaning of "our side."

837
01:04:49,344 --> 01:04:52,263
Cybebe and Octacles risked their lives
to help get you out.

838
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:54,724
Thank you.

839
01:04:56,267 --> 01:04:57,268
But why?

840
01:04:57,352 --> 01:04:59,104
Not all seek to control.

841
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:02,023
Just as not all wish to be free.

842
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:04,943
What is that?

843
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:07,529
An exomorphic-particle codex.
It's pretty new.

844
01:05:07,695 --> 01:05:10,782
It gives programs access to this world.
Within limits.

845
01:05:10,949 --> 01:05:13,952
Limits are the domain of the limited.

846
01:05:14,119 --> 01:05:15,203
Morpheus.

847
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:16,746
Thank you.

848
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:18,289
It was my honor.

849
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:21,418
Wow.

850
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:22,585
How does it work?

851
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:24,129
Paramagnetic oscillation.

852
01:05:24,295 --> 01:05:26,673
If you want,
I can download the codex manual for you.

853
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:29,092
- Sure.
- Downloading used to be fun.

854
01:05:29,509 --> 01:05:31,386
Now it's all manuals and diagnostics.

855
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:33,513
Can I ask them something?

856
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:39,561
When you unplugged me,
there was another pod?

857
01:05:41,146 --> 01:05:43,898
Yes. We've analyzed the data.

858
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:46,443
It could be Trinity.

859
01:05:47,318 --> 01:05:48,528
It's her.

860
01:05:49,154 --> 01:05:51,573
I figured we were going to
have this conversation.

861
01:05:52,282 --> 01:05:55,160
Look, you were not
a typical flush-and-grab.

862
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:57,745
You were in this weird tower
that Cybebe had never accessed,

863
01:05:57,829 --> 01:05:58,997
and she's now exiled.

864
01:05:59,164 --> 01:06:01,207
We burned our one shot for you.

865
01:06:01,749 --> 01:06:03,501
Even if it were Trinity
and she wanted to be free,

866
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:05,587
we have no idea how to do it.

867
01:06:05,753 --> 01:06:06,754
Yet.

868
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:11,551
Nobody believed we'd ever find him,

869
01:06:12,177 --> 01:06:13,178
but we did.

870
01:06:15,597 --> 01:06:16,723
Okay.

871
01:06:17,765 --> 01:06:20,727
We don't know how to get her out... yet.

872
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:25,440
Captain, we're approaching
security clearance.

873
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:27,775
We're here.

874
01:06:28,026 --> 01:06:29,027
Zion?

875
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:38,286
Have a seat.

876
01:06:38,786 --> 01:06:41,414
This is Hanno. Best pilot in our fleet.

877
01:06:41,581 --> 01:06:43,917
Quite a few synthients
deserve that title before me.

878
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:45,710
Mnemosyne, you are cleared for landing.

879
01:06:45,793 --> 01:06:46,711
Welcome home.

880
01:06:46,878 --> 01:06:48,463
Thank you, Control.

881
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:50,131
Um, we're about to crash.

882
01:06:57,138 --> 01:07:00,517
General realized we were never going to
beat the Sentinels,

883
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:02,644
so we just got better at
hiding from them.

884
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:08,816
Welcome to lo.

885
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:11,569
Io.

886
01:07:18,368 --> 01:07:21,037
Wow. That looks real.

887
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:23,122
Bio-sky.

888
01:07:26,834 --> 01:07:28,545
Works kind of like grow lights.

889
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:30,922
It's way more complex than that.

890
01:07:31,089 --> 01:07:33,466
It pulls water from the crust,
hydronating the air.

891
01:07:33,633 --> 01:07:36,761
It balances the ECO and our SRI cycles.

892
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:39,180
Plus...

893
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:41,766
It is pretty to look at.

894
01:07:41,933 --> 01:07:43,685
As opposed to that.

895
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:47,564
I guess the general
sent us a welcome party.

896
01:08:05,832 --> 01:08:07,250
God damn.

897
01:08:08,376 --> 01:08:09,544
It is you.

898
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:11,588
Niobe?

899
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:16,342
A few more wrinkles
and a few less teeth,

900
01:08:17,302 --> 01:08:20,847
but wise enough to know
I don't know anything.

901
01:08:21,014 --> 01:08:23,516
I sure as shit never saw this coming.

902
01:08:24,392 --> 01:08:25,476
Neither did I.

903
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:26,769
I told you he was alive.

904
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:29,063
Captain, you and your crew
have been grounded.

905
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:30,523
General, if you'd just let me explain.

906
01:08:30,690 --> 01:08:33,484
The protocols are put in place
for everyone's protection.

907
01:08:33,651 --> 01:08:36,946
I'm sorry. I saw an opportunity
and I was afraid we'd lose him.

908
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:39,657
But, General,
people have been waiting for so long.

909
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:42,577
We found The One.

910
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:46,122
I don't believe in The One.

911
01:08:48,416 --> 01:08:49,500
I never did.

912
01:08:50,168 --> 01:08:51,252
No?

913
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:53,713
Me neither.

914
01:08:54,047 --> 01:08:58,593
But there was a time
when you trusted me with your ship,

915
01:08:59,302 --> 01:09:01,012
against the Council's orders.

916
01:09:01,179 --> 01:09:03,139
The world was different then.

917
01:09:05,058 --> 01:09:06,601
We were different.

918
01:09:08,728 --> 01:09:10,063
Report to the docks.

919
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:11,856
Scrub down the Mnemosyne.

920
01:09:12,023 --> 01:09:14,192
Transfer your access codes.

921
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:15,777
You are done, Captain.

922
01:09:25,453 --> 01:09:27,246
We need to talk.

923
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:34,712
When word first came,

924
01:09:35,338 --> 01:09:37,465
that it actually might be you,

925
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:45,014
I didn't know how I would feel
in this moment.

926
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:54,941
It is nice to see you.

927
01:09:55,108 --> 01:09:57,652
It's good to see you too.

928
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:06,369
A long way from Dozer's paint stripper.

929
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:08,871
Yes.

930
01:10:09,497 --> 01:10:11,165
A lot has changed.

931
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:14,627
Except maybe you.

932
01:10:17,505 --> 01:10:18,965
You remember this?

933
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:30,768
It's so easy to forget how much noise
the Matrix pumps into your head

934
01:10:30,935 --> 01:10:32,311
until you unplug.

935
01:10:34,147 --> 01:10:35,189
Yeah.

936
01:10:35,815 --> 01:10:38,568
Something else
makes the same kind of noise.

937
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:40,820
Takes over every damn thing

938
01:10:40,987 --> 01:10:42,613
just like the Matrix.

939
01:10:44,282 --> 01:10:45,283
War.

940
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:49,620
I stood at the barricade of the Temple.

941
01:10:51,581 --> 01:10:53,708
Staring at the army of Sentinels,

942
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:57,462
waiting for them to kill
every one of us.

943
01:10:59,005 --> 01:11:02,008
But then, they left.

944
01:11:03,301 --> 01:11:05,636
They said you saved us.

945
01:11:05,803 --> 01:11:07,013
I didn't believe it.

946
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:10,349
Every night I would dream
of attack sirens.

947
01:11:11,017 --> 01:11:12,268
But then,

948
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:17,064
I would wake up to this...

949
01:11:21,068 --> 01:11:22,528
silence.

950
01:11:26,073 --> 01:11:27,658
I'm ashamed of it now.

951
01:11:27,825 --> 01:11:31,704
My pessimism
of how long it took me to believe

952
01:11:31,871 --> 01:11:34,957
a world without war was possible.

953
01:11:36,417 --> 01:11:37,960
You gave me that.

954
01:11:38,544 --> 01:11:40,880
You gave that gift to us all.

955
01:11:41,631 --> 01:11:45,092
And it is the gift
that continues to bear fruit.

956
01:11:47,887 --> 01:11:49,555
Come help me get up.

957
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:51,349
Let's take a walk.

958
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:17,500
Beautiful.

959
01:12:18,709 --> 01:12:21,671
This is Freya, head of botany.

960
01:12:21,838 --> 01:12:24,841
And this is Quillion,
our lead digitologist.

961
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:29,095
I presume
our guest needs no introduction.

962
01:12:29,262 --> 01:12:31,722
Nothing travels faster than light.

963
01:12:31,889 --> 01:12:33,140
Except gossip.

964
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:36,894
Welcome to the Garden, Neo.

965
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:40,189
A strawberry?

966
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:44,360
Using digital code from the Matrix,
we retro-convert it into DNA sequences.

967
01:12:44,527 --> 01:12:45,987
And they grow here?

968
01:12:46,153 --> 01:12:50,324
It's not easy augmenting the genome
to photosynthesize Bio-sky, but...

969
01:12:50,491 --> 01:12:52,076
We're getting there.

970
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:54,537
Go ahead. Try it.

971
01:13:02,086 --> 01:13:04,338
We're quite excited
about the blueberries.

972
01:13:04,505 --> 01:13:06,299
You remember that shit we used to eat?

973
01:13:06,465 --> 01:13:08,718
That slop that tasted like rust.

974
01:13:10,511 --> 01:13:13,848
Zion could have never
made something like this.

975
01:13:14,015 --> 01:13:15,349
Why?

976
01:13:15,808 --> 01:13:18,060
Because we needed synthients

977
01:13:18,436 --> 01:13:20,479
and DI like him.

978
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:23,858
Zion was stuck in the past.
Stuck in war.

979
01:13:24,025 --> 01:13:26,068
Stuck in a Matrix of its own.

980
01:13:26,569 --> 01:13:30,239
They believed
that it had to be us or them.

981
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:33,242
This city was built by us

982
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:35,077
and them.

983
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:42,418
What happened to Zion?

984
01:13:42,585 --> 01:13:45,796
I've been waiting
for you to ask that question.

985
01:13:48,007 --> 01:13:51,344
All of the troubles
started in the Machine Cities.

986
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:54,764
Power plants were unable
to produce enough energy.

987
01:13:55,306 --> 01:13:58,851
Nothing can breed violence
like scarcity.

988
01:14:00,645 --> 01:14:02,271
For the first time,

989
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:05,483
we saw machines at war with one another.

990
01:14:08,736 --> 01:14:12,490
We got word from the Oracle
of a new power rising.

991
01:14:14,617 --> 01:14:17,119
That was the last we heard from her.

992
01:14:20,831 --> 01:14:21,999
Morpheus.

993
01:14:22,166 --> 01:14:26,629
After the siege,
he was elected unanimously.

994
01:14:26,796 --> 01:14:28,798
High Chair of the Council.

995
01:14:29,799 --> 01:14:32,802
How he loved that.

996
01:14:33,344 --> 01:14:37,348
But as rumors of this new power spread,

997
01:14:37,515 --> 01:14:38,724
he ignored them.

998
01:14:38,891 --> 01:14:43,270
He was certain what you had done
could not be undone.

999
01:14:43,938 --> 01:14:47,608
All of these people
never stopped believing in miracles,

1000
01:14:47,775 --> 01:14:50,111
believing in you.

1001
01:15:02,206 --> 01:15:03,541
I'm sorry.

1002
01:15:05,543 --> 01:15:07,920
How could I know this would happen?

1003
01:15:08,087 --> 01:15:10,172
We didn't understand
all of it back then.

1004
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:11,966
No more than we do now.

1005
01:15:12,383 --> 01:15:15,469
I didn't come here
to cause you problems, Niobe,

1006
01:15:16,595 --> 01:15:18,264
but I need your help.

1007
01:15:19,974 --> 01:15:21,434
Trinity is alive.

1008
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,227
Then there is another question.

1009
01:15:23,394 --> 01:15:25,062
Why did they keep her alive?

1010
01:15:25,229 --> 01:15:26,439
I can't answer that.

1011
01:15:26,605 --> 01:15:29,817
But if there's a chance I can free her,

1012
01:15:29,984 --> 01:15:31,652
I have to try.

1013
01:15:31,819 --> 01:15:35,489
Even if it means
endangering everyone in this city?

1014
01:15:39,785 --> 01:15:41,120
I'm sorry, Neo.

1015
01:15:41,746 --> 01:15:45,207
I won't let what happened to Zion
happen to Io.

1016
01:15:47,168 --> 01:15:50,838
I hope you'll forgive an old woman
for asking you to go with Sheperd here,

1017
01:15:51,797 --> 01:15:54,258
till we have better understanding
of what's going on.

1018
01:15:54,925 --> 01:15:57,762
You're going to imprison me
after I just got free?

1019
01:15:57,928 --> 01:16:00,806
I know it doesn't seem fair,

1020
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:03,809
but neither does growing old.

1021
01:16:04,769 --> 01:16:06,729
But you don't hear me complaining.

1022
01:16:18,741 --> 01:16:19,825
Sorry.

1023
01:16:20,785 --> 01:16:22,703
I've never met a legend before.

1024
01:16:26,082 --> 01:16:27,166
Neo.

1025
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:29,668
Sheperd.

1026
01:16:31,629 --> 01:16:33,422
Crazy. You're real.

1027
01:16:35,382 --> 01:16:36,509
"Real."

1028
01:16:37,635 --> 01:16:39,595
There's that word again.

1029
01:16:45,309 --> 01:16:47,144
People talk a lot
about the old days.

1030
01:16:47,645 --> 01:16:49,772
About you, the viral Agent.

1031
01:16:49,939 --> 01:16:51,565
The siege of Zion.

1032
01:16:52,775 --> 01:16:54,610
Everything was simpler back then.

1033
01:16:55,694 --> 01:16:57,196
People wanted to be free.

1034
01:16:59,323 --> 01:17:00,616
It's different now.

1035
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:04,745
Sometimes it feels like people gave up.

1036
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:07,164
Like the Matrix won.

1037
01:17:10,543 --> 01:17:11,919
This is you.

1038
01:17:16,006 --> 01:17:18,217
And I gotta ask you one thing.

1039
01:17:20,344 --> 01:17:21,971
Is it true you could fly?

1040
01:17:26,809 --> 01:17:27,810
Cool.

1041
01:17:58,382 --> 01:17:59,466
Morpheus.

1042
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:02,636
General stuck you
in the Rapunzel tower.

1043
01:18:05,222 --> 01:18:06,724
On the upside, it's a nice view.

1044
01:18:06,891 --> 01:18:08,934
What happened to Bugs and the others?

1045
01:18:09,101 --> 01:18:11,812
They're supposed to be sterilizing
the Mnemosyne with a toothbrush.

1046
01:18:11,896 --> 01:18:12,855
"Supposed to be"?

1047
01:18:13,022 --> 01:18:14,273
Well, I could tell you
that they're standing by,

1048
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:17,568
waiting for you to make the choice
to remain meekly incarcerated

1049
01:18:17,735 --> 01:18:19,862
or bust the hell out of here
and go and find Trinity.

1050
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:22,531
But that ain't a choice.

1051
01:18:35,336 --> 01:18:37,296
General, what should we do?

1052
01:18:40,925 --> 01:18:43,385
Bugs has the same
independence of mind

1053
01:18:43,469 --> 01:18:44,929
she had the day you freed her.

1054
01:18:45,095 --> 01:18:47,890
This is not independence of mind.

1055
01:18:48,057 --> 01:18:49,058
It's mutiny.

1056
01:18:50,476 --> 01:18:51,477
Come on, 'Be.

1057
01:18:51,894 --> 01:18:54,813
I know how much you hated
locking him up.

1058
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:57,608
Just like I know there's a part of you

1059
01:18:57,775 --> 01:19:00,653
that's relieved now that he's gone.

1060
01:19:02,279 --> 01:19:05,950
We've worked so hard to keep lo safe.

1061
01:19:08,744 --> 01:19:10,329
This scares me.

1062
01:19:20,923 --> 01:19:22,174
That's her.

1063
01:19:22,341 --> 01:19:23,384
On the bridge.

1064
01:19:23,884 --> 01:19:24,927
Got her.

1065
01:19:33,727 --> 01:19:35,938
It's sick how the Semblance works.

1066
01:19:36,105 --> 01:19:37,606
You see flashes of the real her,

1067
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:40,401
but the way she reads...

1068
01:19:42,278 --> 01:19:44,738
Code-wise, she's pure bluepill.

1069
01:19:46,824 --> 01:19:49,702
This is a tough question, Neo,
but it has to be asked.

1070
01:19:50,995 --> 01:19:52,997
What if she's happy where she is?

1071
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:55,708
How did I read?

1072
01:19:57,835 --> 01:19:59,712
Exactly like her.

1073
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:05,259
Take us to broadcast depth.

1074
01:20:17,104 --> 01:20:18,480
Thank you for helping me.

1075
01:20:20,274 --> 01:20:22,109
Most of us are here because of you.

1076
01:20:24,862 --> 01:20:27,448
I also admit our only chance
to get out of the general's doghouse

1077
01:20:27,614 --> 01:20:29,116
is for you to find your mojo.

1078
01:20:30,951 --> 01:20:33,412
What if I can't be what I once was?

1079
01:20:35,122 --> 01:20:36,540
Then we're all fucked.

1080
01:20:36,707 --> 01:20:38,042
Two minutes.

1081
01:20:38,208 --> 01:20:39,501
Two minutes to broadcast.

1082
01:20:48,886 --> 01:20:50,054
I slipped you in
through a hotel room.

1083
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:53,307
Should be safe.

1084
01:21:04,151 --> 01:21:05,277
Portal's open.

1085
01:21:05,444 --> 01:21:07,488
Closest I could get you
is the warehouse near her garage.

1086
01:21:08,072 --> 01:21:09,448
Whole zone's crawling with bots.

1087
01:21:10,824 --> 01:21:12,368
Let's go.

1088
01:21:39,728 --> 01:21:41,355
So, what do you think of him?

1089
01:21:43,065 --> 01:21:45,609
I was kinda worried at first
because he's so much older.

1090
01:21:45,776 --> 01:21:48,320
The beard, the hair...

1091
01:21:48,487 --> 01:21:51,115
- No, totally works for me.
- You idiot.

1092
01:21:51,865 --> 01:21:53,158
I mean "The One" thing.

1093
01:21:55,035 --> 01:21:57,413
You know, everyone that
shipped with him died.

1094
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:00,666
Yeah. He's gonna
get us all killed for sure.

1095
01:22:06,088 --> 01:22:07,589
Predictable as ever.

1096
01:22:09,842 --> 01:22:11,218
Smith.

1097
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,679
Smith? As in, the Smith?

1098
01:22:22,229 --> 01:22:23,313
This is so insane.

1099
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:24,690
There's so many theories
about the two of them

1100
01:22:24,898 --> 01:22:26,525
and they're standing right there.

1101
01:22:26,692 --> 01:22:28,235
This code is freaky.

1102
01:22:28,402 --> 01:22:31,155
He's like an Agent, but not.

1103
01:22:35,409 --> 01:22:36,910
An appeal to reason.

1104
01:22:41,206 --> 01:22:42,708
How did you find us?

1105
01:22:42,875 --> 01:22:45,002
You never appreciated our relationship.

1106
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:47,129
Not like The Analyst.

1107
01:22:47,296 --> 01:22:49,214
- The what?
- My doctor.

1108
01:22:49,381 --> 01:22:53,010
He used our bond
and turned it into a chain.

1109
01:22:53,177 --> 01:22:54,636
It's so obvious once you see it, right?

1110
01:22:54,803 --> 01:22:57,639
But this whole altered-code update
really blew my mind.

1111
01:22:58,390 --> 01:23:00,225
I still don't know how he did it.

1112
01:23:00,392 --> 01:23:02,603
You, as a balding nerd.

1113
01:23:03,228 --> 01:23:04,438
Hilarious.

1114
01:23:05,063 --> 01:23:06,899
And me...

1115
01:23:07,524 --> 01:23:09,359
Even more perfect.

1116
01:23:10,444 --> 01:23:12,154
Maybe a little too far
on the piercing blue eyes.

1117
01:23:12,362 --> 01:23:13,614
What do you think?

1118
01:23:14,406 --> 01:23:16,283
What do you want, Smith?

1119
01:23:18,494 --> 01:23:22,122
I have such dreams, Tom. Big dreams.

1120
01:23:22,873 --> 01:23:25,459
Well, mostly just extremely violent
revenge fantasies,

1121
01:23:25,626 --> 01:23:26,793
but in order for me to pursue mine,

1122
01:23:26,877 --> 01:23:29,087
I need to dissuade you
from pursuing yours.

1123
01:23:29,171 --> 01:23:32,716
Sounds like conflict.

1124
01:23:34,468 --> 01:23:35,969
Inevitable?

1125
01:23:37,262 --> 01:23:38,597
Doesn't have to be.

1126
01:23:38,764 --> 01:23:40,891
All you have to do
is stay out of the Matrix,

1127
01:23:40,974 --> 01:23:42,434
and leave the good doctor to me.

1128
01:23:42,601 --> 01:23:44,728
You can have him. I'm here for Trinity.

1129
01:23:44,895 --> 01:23:46,438
That's the trouble, Tom.

1130
01:23:46,605 --> 01:23:48,857
He knew you'd come, just like I did.

1131
01:23:50,859 --> 01:23:52,069
Trust me.

1132
01:23:53,111 --> 01:23:54,446
You're not ready for him.

1133
01:23:54,613 --> 01:23:57,449
Captain, I'm reading portals
from the lower frequencies.

1134
01:24:02,913 --> 01:24:05,916
I won't have his leash on my neck again.

1135
01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:15,634
I found some old acquaintances of yours.

1136
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:20,055
Bugs!

1137
01:24:33,777 --> 01:24:34,820
Exiles.

1138
01:24:34,903 --> 01:24:35,988
I thought they were all purged.

1139
01:24:36,154 --> 01:24:37,239
You?

1140
01:24:38,949 --> 01:24:40,909
It is you!

1141
01:24:42,578 --> 01:24:46,164
All these years. I can't believe it.

1142
01:24:46,832 --> 01:24:48,458
God.

1143
01:24:48,625 --> 01:24:52,504
You stole my life!

1144
01:24:57,509 --> 01:24:58,927
What the Merv
is trying to say is that

1145
01:24:59,011 --> 01:25:01,471
their situation
is a little bit like mine.

1146
01:25:01,638 --> 01:25:03,682
To have their lives back,
yours has to end.

1147
01:25:07,352 --> 01:25:08,353
Kill him!

1148
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:24,161
You ruined

1149
01:25:24,328 --> 01:25:27,289
every suck-my-silky-ass thing!

1150
01:25:27,456 --> 01:25:30,000
We had grace.

1151
01:25:35,088 --> 01:25:36,590
We had style!

1152
01:25:36,757 --> 01:25:38,759
We had conversation!

1153
01:25:38,925 --> 01:25:40,761
Not this...

1154
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:08,789
Art, films, books were all better!

1155
01:26:08,955 --> 01:26:12,125
Originality mattered!

1156
01:26:12,292 --> 01:26:14,169
You gave us Face-Zucker-suck

1157
01:26:14,336 --> 01:26:17,631
and
Couch-flix-climatey-Wiki-piss-and-shit!

1158
01:27:03,844 --> 01:27:05,345
I still know kung fu.

1159
01:27:07,222 --> 01:27:08,223
Neo!

1160
01:27:38,003 --> 01:27:39,421
Just like old times.

1161
01:28:37,062 --> 01:28:38,104
Neo.

1162
01:28:40,190 --> 01:28:42,192
I've been thinking about us, Tom.

1163
01:28:42,984 --> 01:28:46,071
About binaries that form
the nature of things.

1164
01:28:47,405 --> 01:28:48,657
Ones and zeros.

1165
01:28:49,908 --> 01:28:50,951
Light and dark.

1166
01:28:53,161 --> 01:28:55,163
Choice and its absence.

1167
01:28:58,583 --> 01:29:00,752
Anderson and Smith.

1168
01:29:37,497 --> 01:29:39,583
You've lost something, Tom.

1169
01:29:43,712 --> 01:29:45,380
You're not what you used to be.

1170
01:29:46,673 --> 01:29:47,716
It's true.

1171
01:30:01,146 --> 01:30:03,064
- Nice one.
- Thanks.

1172
01:30:10,947 --> 01:30:12,115
Come on, Neo.

1173
01:30:37,140 --> 01:30:39,225
Captain. You okay?

1174
01:30:39,768 --> 01:30:42,020
Yeah. Where's Neo?

1175
01:30:42,812 --> 01:30:43,855
Smith is killing him.

1176
01:30:44,022 --> 01:30:45,190
Where?

1177
01:30:52,948 --> 01:30:54,866
I feel bad about this, Tom.

1178
01:30:57,661 --> 01:30:59,579
After all,
you are the one who set me free...

1179
01:31:00,872 --> 01:31:01,873
again.

1180
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,711
So you, more than anyone,
understands why I can't go back.

1181
01:31:09,464 --> 01:31:11,091
You should have listened to me.

1182
01:31:13,426 --> 01:31:15,053
Now you'll never see her again.

1183
01:31:28,692 --> 01:31:29,776
What was that?

1184
01:31:29,943 --> 01:31:31,277
That was Neo.

1185
01:31:32,946 --> 01:31:33,989
Mojo rising.

1186
01:31:42,038 --> 01:31:43,331
You all right?

1187
01:31:43,498 --> 01:31:44,499
Yeah.

1188
01:31:45,208 --> 01:31:47,544
- It's gonna trigger a response.
- I got multiple exits ready.

1189
01:31:47,711 --> 01:31:49,129
This is not over yet!

1190
01:31:49,295 --> 01:31:51,798
Our sequel franchise spinoff!

1191
01:31:59,014 --> 01:32:00,265
We should go.

1192
01:32:00,432 --> 01:32:01,599
I can't.

1193
01:32:01,766 --> 01:32:03,685
I have to talk to her.

1194
01:32:03,852 --> 01:32:07,105
Neo, those Exiles were older than you,
and we barely handled them.

1195
01:32:10,775 --> 01:32:12,235
You really wanna do this now?

1196
01:32:17,657 --> 01:32:18,867
I mean...

1197
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:24,289
you look like shit.

1198
01:32:35,842 --> 01:32:38,219
My God. What? What happened?

1199
01:32:38,386 --> 01:32:39,471
An accident.

1200
01:32:39,637 --> 01:32:41,848
Kush. Call a doctor.

1201
01:32:42,015 --> 01:32:43,516
It's fine.

1202
01:32:44,517 --> 01:32:46,144
I don't have a lot of time.

1203
01:32:46,811 --> 01:32:48,396
I wasn't sure I'd see you again.

1204
01:32:48,563 --> 01:32:51,024
After we spoke, I realized

1205
01:32:51,941 --> 01:32:53,943
my life wasn't a life.

1206
01:32:55,528 --> 01:33:00,492
At some point, I think I gave up
searching for something real.

1207
01:33:06,831 --> 01:33:08,124
Wait.

1208
01:33:09,667 --> 01:33:11,294
Something happened.

1209
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:14,631
I looked for you at the coffee shop.

1210
01:33:16,549 --> 01:33:18,760
I began to wonder if I imagined you.

1211
01:33:20,095 --> 01:33:22,097
And then last night I had a dream.

1212
01:33:23,223 --> 01:33:25,350
In the dream,
you were surrounded by police,

1213
01:33:25,517 --> 01:33:27,060
then they started chasing us.

1214
01:33:28,228 --> 01:33:31,064
- Us?
- You were on my bike with me.

1215
01:33:33,274 --> 01:33:34,609
How did it end?

1216
01:33:36,027 --> 01:33:37,195
Not good.

1217
01:33:39,906 --> 01:33:43,201
I've had dreams
that weren't just dreams.

1218
01:33:43,368 --> 01:33:45,495
You mean a dream that came true?

1219
01:33:53,336 --> 01:33:55,797
Finally, we can talk like adults.

1220
01:33:57,632 --> 01:34:00,593
I hate lying. I do.
It exhausts me.

1221
01:34:02,554 --> 01:34:05,890
Tiff and I have been waiting for you,
like, forever.

1222
01:34:12,939 --> 01:34:14,190
Déjà vu, right?

1223
01:34:16,151 --> 01:34:18,278
No use. You can't beat time.

1224
01:34:18,444 --> 01:34:21,948
This rewind is happening
faster than you can blink.

1225
01:34:26,911 --> 01:34:28,830
You gave me the idea.

1226
01:34:31,833 --> 01:34:34,961
Allow me to sum up our goal
in a single word.

1227
01:34:38,047 --> 01:34:39,090
"Bullet time."

1228
01:34:41,050 --> 01:34:43,094
I know. Kind of ironic,

1229
01:34:43,261 --> 01:34:46,806
using the power that defined you
to control you.

1230
01:34:47,098 --> 01:34:49,684
I kept such a close eye on you

1231
01:34:49,851 --> 01:34:51,477
and, still, you found a way out.

1232
01:34:52,478 --> 01:34:54,731
Clever monkey, using that Modal.

1233
01:34:55,773 --> 01:34:58,026
Call me an optimist,
but this could all be for the best.

1234
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:01,779
The skin's not looking
too bad this time.

1235
01:35:02,363 --> 01:35:04,782
I know some of this
will be difficult for you to hear,

1236
01:35:04,949 --> 01:35:06,326
after everything you went through.

1237
01:35:06,492 --> 01:35:07,702
All that pain and suffering,

1238
01:35:07,869 --> 01:35:10,663
only to learn
the world doesn't end when you do.

1239
01:35:12,207 --> 01:35:13,291
Surprise.

1240
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:20,757
I was there when you died.

1241
01:35:23,259 --> 01:35:27,722
I said to myself,
"Here is the anomaly of anomalies."

1242
01:35:27,889 --> 01:35:30,516
What an extraordinary opportunity.

1243
01:35:32,310 --> 01:35:35,146
First, I had to convince the Suits
to let me rebuild the two of you.

1244
01:35:35,313 --> 01:35:38,566
Why her? Getting there.
And don't worry, she can't hear me.

1245
01:35:38,983 --> 01:35:41,903
Resurrecting you both
was crazy expensive.

1246
01:35:42,070 --> 01:35:43,446
Like renovating a house.

1247
01:35:43,613 --> 01:35:45,657
Took twice as long, cost twice as much.

1248
01:35:49,577 --> 01:35:52,205
I thought you'd be happy
to be alive again.

1249
01:35:53,248 --> 01:35:54,624
So wrong.

1250
01:35:56,376 --> 01:35:59,963
Did you know hope and despair
are nearly identical in code?

1251
01:36:02,006 --> 01:36:04,008
We worked for years

1252
01:36:04,175 --> 01:36:05,718
trying to activate your source code.

1253
01:36:05,885 --> 01:36:09,097
I was about to give up,
when I realized...

1254
01:36:12,183 --> 01:36:13,226
Trinity.

1255
01:36:13,393 --> 01:36:15,603
it was never just you.

1256
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:18,439
Alone, neither of you
is of any particular value.

1257
01:36:20,441 --> 01:36:23,569
Like acids and bases,
you're dangerous when mixed together.

1258
01:36:24,195 --> 01:36:26,364
Every sim where you two bonded,

1259
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:29,200
let's just say bad things happened.

1260
01:36:31,244 --> 01:36:32,704
Neo!

1261
01:36:37,166 --> 01:36:40,295
However, as long as I managed
to keep you close,

1262
01:36:40,461 --> 01:36:42,171
but not too close,

1263
01:36:42,338 --> 01:36:44,590
I discovered something incredible.

1264
01:36:45,633 --> 01:36:49,095
Now, my predecessor loved precision.

1265
01:36:49,262 --> 01:36:52,682
His Matrix was all fussy facts
and equations.

1266
01:36:52,849 --> 01:36:54,600
He hated the human mind.

1267
01:36:54,767 --> 01:36:57,312
So he never bothered to realize
that you don't give a shit about facts.

1268
01:36:57,478 --> 01:36:58,896
It's all about fiction.

1269
01:36:59,063 --> 01:37:03,026
The only world that matters
is the one in here.

1270
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:06,654
And you people believe
the craziest shit.

1271
01:37:07,196 --> 01:37:08,197
Why?

1272
01:37:08,364 --> 01:37:11,117
What validates
and makes your fictions real?

1273
01:37:12,076 --> 01:37:13,161
Feelings.

1274
01:37:14,370 --> 01:37:15,788
Allow me.

1275
01:37:17,290 --> 01:37:18,833
Kush here is one of my handlers.

1276
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,251
They're everywhere.

1277
01:37:20,418 --> 01:37:23,087
Such a pain,
cloning Agents over a coppertop.

1278
01:37:23,254 --> 01:37:25,465
Far more effective
just to saturate a population.

1279
01:37:27,550 --> 01:37:30,303
And, bonus, swarm mode is sick fun.

1280
01:37:42,732 --> 01:37:45,818
Ooh! Nicely done.

1281
01:37:47,445 --> 01:37:50,114
You ever wonder why you have nightmares?

1282
01:37:50,782 --> 01:37:53,368
Why your own brain tortures you?

1283
01:37:53,826 --> 01:37:56,621
It's actually us,
maximizing your output.

1284
01:37:57,330 --> 01:37:58,456
It works just like this.

1285
01:37:58,623 --> 01:38:01,167
No. Can you stop the bullet?

1286
01:38:01,334 --> 01:38:04,337
If only you could move faster.

1287
01:38:04,420 --> 01:38:06,881
Here's the thing
about feelings.

1288
01:38:07,048 --> 01:38:09,133
They're so much easier to control
than facts.

1289
01:38:10,176 --> 01:38:12,095
Turns out, in my Matrix,

1290
01:38:12,261 --> 01:38:15,556
the worse we treat you,
the more we manipulate you,

1291
01:38:15,723 --> 01:38:18,059
the more energy you produce.

1292
01:38:18,226 --> 01:38:19,811
It's nuts.

1293
01:38:20,603 --> 01:38:23,481
I've been setting productivity records
every year since I took over.

1294
01:38:23,648 --> 01:38:26,317
And, the best part, zero resistance.

1295
01:38:26,484 --> 01:38:27,777
People stay in their pods,

1296
01:38:27,944 --> 01:38:30,321
happier than pigs in shit.

1297
01:38:31,072 --> 01:38:32,156
The key to it all?

1298
01:38:32,323 --> 01:38:33,574
You.

1299
01:38:33,741 --> 01:38:34,992
And her.

1300
01:38:35,159 --> 01:38:37,370
Quietly yearning
for what you don't have,

1301
01:38:37,453 --> 01:38:39,414
while dreading losing what you do.

1302
01:38:39,872 --> 01:38:43,918
For 99.9% of your race,
that is the definition of reality.

1303
01:38:44,377 --> 01:38:46,337
Desire and fear, baby.

1304
01:38:47,463 --> 01:38:50,216
Just give the people
what they want, right?

1305
01:38:59,684 --> 01:39:02,395
She's the only home you have, Thomas.

1306
01:39:02,854 --> 01:39:06,023
Come home
before something terrible happens.

1307
01:39:16,451 --> 01:39:17,452
- Bugs!
- I hear him.

1308
01:39:24,041 --> 01:39:25,042
Trinity!

1309
01:39:25,126 --> 01:39:27,003
- You shouldn't call me that.
- I'm sorry.

1310
01:39:28,546 --> 01:39:29,714
I have to go.

1311
01:39:29,881 --> 01:39:31,007
But I'll be back.

1312
01:39:32,175 --> 01:39:34,427
Neo! Time to go.

1313
01:39:37,013 --> 01:39:38,473
- Sentinels?
- Worse.

1314
01:39:40,266 --> 01:39:42,351
General ordered me
to look after the ship.

1315
01:39:42,435 --> 01:39:43,436
So you shadowed us?

1316
01:39:44,437 --> 01:39:45,938
Check your long-range scans.

1317
01:39:46,105 --> 01:39:47,940
Squids are combing this area.

1318
01:39:48,107 --> 01:39:49,192
He's right.

1319
01:39:49,692 --> 01:39:52,737
You can stay here and die,
or come back and face a court-martial.

1320
01:39:53,404 --> 01:39:55,323
And you call that a choice?

1321
01:40:02,788 --> 01:40:04,832
Sheperd should have left you
to the Squids.

1322
01:40:04,999 --> 01:40:08,127
I'm too damn old
to sit through some boring-ass trial.

1323
01:40:08,294 --> 01:40:09,420
Niobe, don't blame Bugs.

1324
01:40:09,587 --> 01:40:11,130
Do shut your mouth.

1325
01:40:11,589 --> 01:40:13,925
Do address me as General.

1326
01:40:14,091 --> 01:40:18,221
And do not rob my ex-captain
of her agency,

1327
01:40:18,387 --> 01:40:20,389
which she exercised with her own

1328
01:40:20,473 --> 01:40:23,809
particular brand
of shortsighted stupidity.

1329
01:40:25,102 --> 01:40:26,145
Shortsighted?

1330
01:40:28,064 --> 01:40:31,859
You care more about growing fruit
than freeing minds.

1331
01:40:32,026 --> 01:40:34,445
We are not going
to have this argument again.

1332
01:40:34,612 --> 01:40:36,447
It's not an argument. It's a fact.

1333
01:40:36,948 --> 01:40:38,074
You gave up on people.

1334
01:40:39,700 --> 01:40:41,911
I tell you what I'm going to give up on,

1335
01:40:41,994 --> 01:40:43,037
and it's you!

1336
01:40:45,581 --> 01:40:48,584
- Sheperd, get her out of my sight.
- General.

1337
01:40:50,503 --> 01:40:51,546
Disarm!

1338
01:40:51,712 --> 01:40:53,297
Kujaku's a friend.

1339
01:40:59,887 --> 01:41:01,389
Hello, friend.

1340
01:41:04,058 --> 01:41:05,059
Okay.

1341
01:41:06,394 --> 01:41:07,603
Him?

1342
01:41:14,527 --> 01:41:15,861
General.

1343
01:41:16,362 --> 01:41:17,613
Thank you for seeing me.

1344
01:41:17,780 --> 01:41:21,784
I figured if there was anyone
who could make sense of this mess,

1345
01:41:21,951 --> 01:41:23,661
it would be you.

1346
01:41:23,828 --> 01:41:24,870
Hello, Neo.

1347
01:41:25,037 --> 01:41:26,497
I know you.

1348
01:41:27,039 --> 01:41:28,916
I tried to keep my eye on you.

1349
01:41:32,253 --> 01:41:33,504
Why?

1350
01:41:33,671 --> 01:41:35,339
We met a long time ago.

1351
01:41:37,091 --> 01:41:38,134
Good morning.

1352
01:41:40,970 --> 01:41:41,971
Sati.

1353
01:41:42,138 --> 01:41:44,181
My father knew we'd meet again,

1354
01:41:44,849 --> 01:41:46,934
though he would have wished
for happier circumstances.

1355
01:41:47,852 --> 01:41:49,520
His inadvertent role
in what happened to you

1356
01:41:49,687 --> 01:41:51,772
was the greatest regret of his life.

1357
01:41:51,939 --> 01:41:53,733
I don't understand.

1358
01:41:55,234 --> 01:41:58,070
My father was the chief engineer
at the Anomaleum.

1359
01:41:58,237 --> 01:41:59,697
The what?

1360
01:41:59,864 --> 01:42:02,491
My father designed the resurrection pods

1361
01:42:02,992 --> 01:42:04,744
where Neo and Trinity were imprisoned.

1362
01:42:06,829 --> 01:42:07,830
I'm sorry.

1363
01:42:08,247 --> 01:42:09,749
You knew what happened to him?

1364
01:42:09,915 --> 01:42:12,918
You knew that he and Trinity
both were alive,

1365
01:42:14,003 --> 01:42:15,338
and you didn't tell me?

1366
01:42:15,504 --> 01:42:18,174
There were times
I doubted my decision, Niobe.

1367
01:42:18,341 --> 01:42:19,967
But lo needed you.

1368
01:42:20,134 --> 01:42:23,471
This city needed to be built
for your people as well as mine.

1369
01:42:24,805 --> 01:42:26,265
If I would have told you everything,

1370
01:42:26,682 --> 01:42:28,601
you would have had
a very difficult choice to make.

1371
01:42:28,768 --> 01:42:30,311
My friends

1372
01:42:31,729 --> 01:42:33,898
let me make my own choices.

1373
01:42:34,315 --> 01:42:36,192
If it was a mistake,

1374
01:42:36,359 --> 01:42:38,319
you have my deepest apologies.

1375
01:42:40,488 --> 01:42:41,781
Why are you here now?

1376
01:42:41,947 --> 01:42:44,367
Neo's escape
has destabilized the Matrix.

1377
01:42:44,533 --> 01:42:47,036
The Anomaleum draws its current
from Trinity alone now.

1378
01:42:47,328 --> 01:42:51,290
A fail-safe has been triggered to reset
the Matrix back to the previous version.

1379
01:42:51,624 --> 01:42:53,334
But The Analyst halted the reset.

1380
01:42:53,501 --> 01:42:56,712
He's convinced the authorities
that you will soon return voluntarily.

1381
01:42:57,963 --> 01:42:59,340
And why would he say that?

1382
01:43:00,091 --> 01:43:02,927
Because if I don't go back,
he'll kill Trinity.

1383
01:43:05,846 --> 01:43:08,140
Faced with returning to your pod

1384
01:43:08,307 --> 01:43:10,351
or enduring Trinity's death again.

1385
01:43:11,102 --> 01:43:12,311
What would you choose, Neo?

1386
01:43:13,437 --> 01:43:14,689
I'll go back.

1387
01:43:16,565 --> 01:43:18,734
Well, The Analyst knows you well,

1388
01:43:18,901 --> 01:43:21,404
but that knowledge
has made him incautious.

1389
01:43:21,570 --> 01:43:22,613
After you escaped,

1390
01:43:22,697 --> 01:43:25,658
he should have accepted his losses
and devacuated Trinity.

1391
01:43:26,492 --> 01:43:29,078
But that would have prevented
this extraordinary opportunity

1392
01:43:29,245 --> 01:43:31,080
that now exists before us.

1393
01:43:31,789 --> 01:43:33,624
A few hours ago,

1394
01:43:34,959 --> 01:43:38,212
no one would have been able
to convince me

1395
01:43:38,379 --> 01:43:42,425
that I would be standing here,
trying to explain a mission

1396
01:43:42,591 --> 01:43:44,468
as crazy as this one.

1397
01:43:48,347 --> 01:43:49,890
What are you doing?

1398
01:43:50,057 --> 01:43:51,642
- Volunteering.
- No.

1399
01:43:51,809 --> 01:43:56,063
You are the one captain
that I am ordering to go.

1400
01:43:56,397 --> 01:43:59,567
Now you don't have to order me,
General, 'cause I'm volunteering.

1401
01:44:02,987 --> 01:44:04,488
I need two more.

1402
01:44:09,076 --> 01:44:11,370
Are you out of your minds?

1403
01:44:12,037 --> 01:44:13,789
You don't even know what it is.

1404
01:44:13,956 --> 01:44:16,292
General, we know you.

1405
01:44:16,959 --> 01:44:20,212
If you say this is important,
none of us is choosing to stay home.

1406
01:44:25,634 --> 01:44:26,677
Thank you.

1407
01:44:31,849 --> 01:44:33,768
Knuckle up and good luck.

1408
01:45:03,964 --> 01:45:07,301
Trinity is held in the Anomaleum,
which is in this transmission tower.

1409
01:45:07,468 --> 01:45:09,637
The passages used to rescue Neo
are now sealed

1410
01:45:09,804 --> 01:45:11,806
and a legion of Sentinels
patrols the tower.

1411
01:45:11,972 --> 01:45:13,933
So stealth will be paramount.

1412
01:45:14,099 --> 01:45:15,851
As long as we raise no alarms,

1413
01:45:16,018 --> 01:45:17,937
this first part of the mission
should be the easiest.

1414
01:45:18,103 --> 01:45:21,106
You mean crossing the Fetus Fields,
sneaking across an entire power plant,

1415
01:45:21,273 --> 01:45:24,527
climbing a two-kilometer tower
guarded by thousands of Sentinels?

1416
01:45:24,652 --> 01:45:25,694
That's the easy part?

1417
01:45:25,861 --> 01:45:27,112
Exactly so.

1418
01:45:27,780 --> 01:45:29,990
Because all we have to do
is convince someone

1419
01:45:30,074 --> 01:45:31,659
who does this every day

1420
01:45:31,826 --> 01:45:33,118
to take one of us along.

1421
01:45:56,809 --> 01:46:00,229
Fifty meters below the Anomaleum
is a stratum of amniotic filters.

1422
01:46:00,396 --> 01:46:03,399
Hidden along this edge
is a small hexagonal vent.

1423
01:46:03,899 --> 01:46:06,986
This vent feeds the air intake
into the corpuscular modifier,

1424
01:46:07,152 --> 01:46:10,030
which oxygenates
the bio-gel used in Neo's pod.

1425
01:46:10,698 --> 01:46:11,699
I get it.

1426
01:46:11,866 --> 01:46:14,869
The exomorph
slinkies up Neo's old umbilicus.

1427
01:46:16,203 --> 01:46:17,329
What could go wrong?

1428
01:47:04,209 --> 01:47:06,754
Once inside,
Morpheus will use the System Operator

1429
01:47:06,921 --> 01:47:09,673
to open the devacuator line
and disengage the macerators.

1430
01:47:14,094 --> 01:47:15,638
In order to unplug Trinity's body,

1431
01:47:15,804 --> 01:47:17,890
while her mind
still remains connected to the Matrix,

1432
01:47:18,057 --> 01:47:20,768
I'm gonna need a second human brain
to implement the bypass.

1433
01:47:20,935 --> 01:47:22,645
And since Neo must be with The Analyst,

1434
01:47:22,811 --> 01:47:26,899
the only available mind
that's a near-enough match is yours.

1435
01:47:28,442 --> 01:47:29,443
Figures.

1436
01:47:46,919 --> 01:47:48,003
Thanks, Cybebe.

1437
01:47:56,428 --> 01:47:58,305
Does Trinity still have to
take the red pill?

1438
01:47:58,472 --> 01:48:01,141
Since Kujaku and I are transferring
her consciousness onto the ship,

1439
01:48:01,308 --> 01:48:02,935
it's not strictly necessary.

1440
01:48:03,102 --> 01:48:05,813
But what matters
is that this is her choice.

1441
01:48:07,147 --> 01:48:09,400
Extracting a confused
or an uncertain mind

1442
01:48:09,483 --> 01:48:11,735
will, in all probability, kill her.

1443
01:48:11,902 --> 01:48:14,488
But even if it is what she wants,

1444
01:48:14,655 --> 01:48:17,992
won't The Analyst
just order the Sentinels to stop you?

1445
01:48:18,158 --> 01:48:19,243
He will.

1446
01:48:19,910 --> 01:48:21,829
But if my plan works, it won't matter.

1447
01:48:22,287 --> 01:48:23,288
Why?

1448
01:48:23,455 --> 01:48:24,957
Because we'll already be gone.

1449
01:48:26,875 --> 01:48:30,087
Somebody thinks this hard about a plan,
there has to be a reason why.

1450
01:48:32,381 --> 01:48:35,551
When my father realized
how the Anomaleum was going to be used,

1451
01:48:36,135 --> 01:48:38,887
he covertly transferred
the designs to me.

1452
01:48:39,638 --> 01:48:41,974
The Analyst discovered his betrayal,

1453
01:48:42,141 --> 01:48:43,934
and had my parents purged.

1454
01:48:46,687 --> 01:48:49,565
I would have been murdered too
if it wasn't for Kujaku.

1455
01:48:52,776 --> 01:48:55,362
Not a day goes by
that I don't grieve them.

1456
01:48:56,947 --> 01:48:59,658
I've been praying for this day
for a very long time.

1457
01:49:08,042 --> 01:49:09,460
We're coming up on broadcast.

1458
01:49:12,254 --> 01:49:16,050
I thought you should know
that I'm here because of her.

1459
01:49:19,803 --> 01:49:21,930
All I ever wanted
was to be as fearless as Trinity.

1460
01:49:24,349 --> 01:49:27,394
But I saw how she reacted in the garage,
and I...

1461
01:49:27,770 --> 01:49:29,980
You're wondering if I'm wrong.

1462
01:49:30,439 --> 01:49:31,899
What if we're too late?

1463
01:49:33,817 --> 01:49:35,402
What if she's not Trinity anymore?

1464
01:49:40,949 --> 01:49:43,577
I never believed I was The One.

1465
01:49:44,495 --> 01:49:45,871
But she did.

1466
01:49:46,955 --> 01:49:48,540
She believed in me.

1467
01:49:51,335 --> 01:49:53,420
It's my turn to believe in her.

1468
01:50:18,570 --> 01:50:20,322
This is where it gets tricky.

1469
01:50:31,667 --> 01:50:33,877
Have you ever done
an operation like this?

1470
01:50:34,586 --> 01:50:35,671
Not yet.

1471
01:50:57,442 --> 01:50:58,777
Here we go.

1472
01:51:16,420 --> 01:51:18,046
Welcome home.

1473
01:51:18,505 --> 01:51:20,716
All I want is to talk to her.

1474
01:51:20,883 --> 01:51:22,217
Do you mean Tiff?

1475
01:51:22,384 --> 01:51:25,304
Come back, and you can talk to her
as often as you like.

1476
01:51:25,470 --> 01:51:28,432
I mean, handsome Chad
may have something to say about it.

1477
01:51:28,599 --> 01:51:31,685
If she tells me this is what she wants,

1478
01:51:32,895 --> 01:51:33,979
you win.

1479
01:51:34,146 --> 01:51:35,230
Really?

1480
01:51:35,397 --> 01:51:37,357
But if she wants me,

1481
01:51:38,275 --> 01:51:40,152
then you'll let us go free.

1482
01:51:40,319 --> 01:51:43,071
And why would I do something
as stupid as that?

1483
01:51:43,238 --> 01:51:45,824
Right now, I'm on a ship full of people
who will unplug me

1484
01:51:45,991 --> 01:51:48,285
before they'll let you take me back.

1485
01:51:48,994 --> 01:51:50,579
If you want this Matrix,

1486
01:51:51,121 --> 01:51:52,706
this is your only chance.

1487
01:51:52,873 --> 01:51:55,417
But how do I know
they won't unplug you anyway?

1488
01:51:55,918 --> 01:51:59,046
Same way I know
you'll let us walk out of here.

1489
01:52:24,655 --> 01:52:25,822
Okay.

1490
01:52:26,448 --> 01:52:27,908
I like tests.

1491
01:52:28,867 --> 01:52:30,410
We'll let Tiff decide.

1492
01:52:47,970 --> 01:52:49,096
That's it.

1493
01:52:50,347 --> 01:52:51,515
Bypass is ready.

1494
01:52:51,932 --> 01:52:53,267
Now what?

1495
01:52:53,725 --> 01:52:54,768
We wait.

1496
01:52:55,143 --> 01:52:57,062
Doesn't it seem crazy
to come all this way

1497
01:52:57,145 --> 01:52:58,522
and leave her here?

1498
01:52:58,897 --> 01:53:00,899
We must abide by her decision.

1499
01:53:01,608 --> 01:53:03,110
And if she says no,

1500
01:53:03,986 --> 01:53:05,362
what happens to Neo?

1501
01:53:05,529 --> 01:53:09,616
At this time,
the most important choice of Neo's life

1502
01:53:09,783 --> 01:53:11,201
is not his to make.

1503
01:53:42,316 --> 01:53:44,026
I saw this in my dream.

1504
01:53:45,652 --> 01:53:48,947
If I was the Oracle,
maybe I could explain it.

1505
01:53:49,614 --> 01:53:51,158
The Oracle.

1506
01:53:51,325 --> 01:53:52,951
From your game?

1507
01:53:54,870 --> 01:53:57,080
It's not a game.

1508
01:53:59,207 --> 01:54:00,417
God.

1509
01:54:08,008 --> 01:54:11,261
After you left, I went home

1510
01:54:11,428 --> 01:54:13,096
and I played it.

1511
01:54:15,515 --> 01:54:16,892
I kept thinking,

1512
01:54:18,226 --> 01:54:21,355
"Why does this story
feel like a memory?"

1513
01:54:28,612 --> 01:54:30,280
There's a part of me

1514
01:54:33,158 --> 01:54:36,078
that feels like I have been
waiting my whole life for you.

1515
01:54:39,122 --> 01:54:41,416
And that part is like,

1516
01:54:41,583 --> 01:54:44,252
"What the hell
took you so long?"

1517
01:54:45,253 --> 01:54:47,214
I don't have an easy answer.

1518
01:54:49,466 --> 01:54:51,551
Maybe I was afraid of this.

1519
01:54:53,095 --> 01:54:54,888
Afraid of what might happen.

1520
01:54:56,598 --> 01:54:59,393
Afraid of hurting
the only person I ever loved.

1521
01:55:01,269 --> 01:55:04,648
I wish I was who you think I am.

1522
01:55:06,066 --> 01:55:07,609
But look at me.

1523
01:55:08,985 --> 01:55:10,529
I can't be her.

1524
01:55:11,321 --> 01:55:13,281
- Mom!
- Mom! Come on.

1525
01:55:13,448 --> 01:55:14,574
- Mom!
- It's Callie.

1526
01:55:14,741 --> 01:55:15,742
Is this real?

1527
01:55:15,909 --> 01:55:16,910
You have to come with us.

1528
01:55:16,993 --> 01:55:18,078
Come on, we gotta go.

1529
01:55:18,161 --> 01:55:19,246
Tiff, hey.

1530
01:55:19,329 --> 01:55:21,206
Don't know what's going on here,
but I'm glad we found you.

1531
01:55:21,373 --> 01:55:22,791
- She got hit by a car.
- I know, it's crazy.

1532
01:55:22,958 --> 01:55:24,084
She was chasing after you.

1533
01:55:24,251 --> 01:55:25,293
They're casting her arm. We gotta go.

1534
01:55:25,460 --> 01:55:26,586
Doctor said she's gonna be fine.

1535
01:55:26,753 --> 01:55:28,422
You have to come with us
to the hospital.

1536
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:29,881
It's too late.

1537
01:55:30,048 --> 01:55:31,091
I understand.

1538
01:55:31,258 --> 01:55:33,135
- Tiff, come on, let's go.
- Come on.

1539
01:55:39,683 --> 01:55:40,725
What's happening?

1540
01:55:42,853 --> 01:55:44,020
Neo was wrong.

1541
01:56:17,304 --> 01:56:18,388
Tiffany.

1542
01:56:22,100 --> 01:56:24,519
Tiffany, you have to come with us.

1543
01:56:26,229 --> 01:56:27,522
Tiffany!

1544
01:56:29,983 --> 01:56:33,487
I wish you would
fucking stop calling me that.

1545
01:56:33,653 --> 01:56:35,155
I hate that name.

1546
01:56:36,698 --> 01:56:38,283
My name is Trinity

1547
01:56:38,450 --> 01:56:40,660
and you better
take your hands off of me.

1548
01:56:51,838 --> 01:56:52,839
Neo!

1549
01:56:53,340 --> 01:56:54,341
Trinity!

1550
01:56:55,550 --> 01:56:56,551
Shit.

1551
01:56:57,928 --> 01:56:59,137
Get her out. Get her out!

1552
01:57:07,896 --> 01:57:10,357
Aye-yi-yi, what a mess.

1553
01:57:11,399 --> 01:57:13,944
I own that mistake.
Shouldn't have pressed.

1554
01:57:14,110 --> 01:57:16,071
Women used to be so easy to control.

1555
01:57:17,280 --> 01:57:21,576
You know there's no way
I can let you two go free.

1556
01:57:25,038 --> 01:57:26,456
Cannot happen.

1557
01:57:29,793 --> 01:57:32,462
So, I guess it's déjà vu all over again.

1558
01:57:33,588 --> 01:57:34,756
She dies,

1559
01:57:35,549 --> 01:57:36,841
and it's all your fault.

1560
01:57:38,426 --> 01:57:40,971
Lies, lies and more lies.

1561
01:57:41,721 --> 01:57:42,931
Smith?

1562
01:57:43,098 --> 01:57:45,433
What has the world come to
when you can't even trust a program?

1563
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:47,978
How...

1564
01:57:49,104 --> 01:57:51,398
Tom and I have more in common
than you know.

1565
01:57:51,856 --> 01:57:54,776
Once he got out, let's just say,

1566
01:57:55,694 --> 01:57:57,404
I was free to be me.

1567
01:58:05,161 --> 01:58:07,330
- Yeah!
- Trinity?

1568
01:58:56,254 --> 01:58:57,297
You ready?

1569
01:58:57,464 --> 01:58:58,757
Yeah.

1570
01:59:40,882 --> 01:59:42,300
No.

1571
01:59:43,760 --> 01:59:46,054
Destroy her. Destroy her!

1572
02:00:09,911 --> 02:00:11,204
Stop them.

1573
02:00:37,105 --> 02:00:38,523
You think this is over?

1574
02:00:38,690 --> 02:00:40,608
Lockdown. Initiate swarm.

1575
02:00:49,743 --> 02:00:51,911
Here, our unexpected alliance ends.

1576
02:00:53,747 --> 02:00:55,582
You know the difference between us, Tom?

1577
02:00:56,416 --> 02:00:57,834
Anyone could have been you.

1578
02:00:58,376 --> 02:01:00,295
Whereas I've always been anyone.

1579
02:01:05,759 --> 02:01:06,843
What just happened?

1580
02:01:07,302 --> 02:01:08,428
What?

1581
02:01:10,555 --> 02:01:12,849
No! Move! Move!

1582
02:01:13,183 --> 02:01:14,225
Get the hell out of there.

1583
02:01:18,146 --> 02:01:19,981
- How bad?
- Like, all the bad.

1584
02:01:21,357 --> 02:01:22,734
Yeah, this is bad.

1585
02:01:24,277 --> 02:01:25,737
I don't suppose you can still fly?

1586
02:01:36,247 --> 02:01:37,832
Yeah, that's not happening.

1587
02:02:03,608 --> 02:02:04,859
Neo! Get on.

1588
02:02:13,618 --> 02:02:15,370
Calliope! Take the wounded!

1589
02:02:15,537 --> 02:02:17,413
Everyone else, we stay with them!

1590
02:02:34,639 --> 02:02:37,016
- How is she?
- Life signs are good.

1591
02:02:40,979 --> 02:02:42,313
Her signal's strong, Captain.

1592
02:02:51,239 --> 02:02:53,241
Well done, Captain.

1593
02:02:55,702 --> 02:02:57,412
Now all we need is a miracle.

1594
02:03:25,607 --> 02:03:26,608
I hate bots.

1595
02:03:33,072 --> 02:03:34,866
- Get us out of here!
- I'm trying!

1596
02:03:35,033 --> 02:03:36,826
The lockdown is tracking.
Swarm is everywhere.

1597
02:03:36,993 --> 02:03:38,077
Never seen anything like this.

1598
02:04:23,998 --> 02:04:26,125
Seq, what is that?

1599
02:04:31,172 --> 02:04:32,256
What's wrong?

1600
02:04:34,050 --> 02:04:35,468
What are you...

1601
02:04:43,142 --> 02:04:45,061
He's turning bots into bombs.

1602
02:05:17,552 --> 02:05:18,636
Shit!

1603
02:05:18,803 --> 02:05:19,804
Lexy?

1604
02:05:34,277 --> 02:05:35,445
Sheperd's in trouble.

1605
02:05:38,531 --> 02:05:39,699
Jack me in.

1606
02:05:40,616 --> 02:05:42,410
I can get you in.
I don't know if I can get you out.

1607
02:05:48,499 --> 02:05:50,084
No!

1608
02:06:03,514 --> 02:06:04,557
What are they doing?

1609
02:06:08,728 --> 02:06:10,271
Herding them into a kill zone.

1610
02:06:43,429 --> 02:06:44,806
Captain, you gotta hurry.

1611
02:06:44,889 --> 02:06:47,058
Hang on, Lex.

1612
02:06:51,312 --> 02:06:53,064
Lexy!

1613
02:07:35,398 --> 02:07:36,482
There they are!

1614
02:08:02,925 --> 02:08:04,093
Morpheus!

1615
02:08:07,972 --> 02:08:08,973
Lex.

1616
02:08:09,849 --> 02:08:11,642
- Bugsy.
- Hell yeah!

1617
02:08:12,643 --> 02:08:14,228
Seq, where's Neo?

1618
02:08:14,395 --> 02:08:15,938
It's bad. They're pinned.

1619
02:08:16,105 --> 02:08:17,106
Heading to a roof.

1620
02:09:26,509 --> 02:09:29,136
Nodal fibrillation is critical.
She'll die if we don't extract.

1621
02:10:10,177 --> 02:10:12,763
It's so beautiful.

1622
02:10:28,112 --> 02:10:29,780
I remember this.

1623
02:10:31,907 --> 02:10:34,076
I remember us.

1624
02:10:52,219 --> 02:10:54,180
My dream ended here.

1625
02:11:05,107 --> 02:11:06,650
We can't go back.

1626
02:11:08,778 --> 02:11:09,862
We won't.

1627
02:11:29,215 --> 02:11:30,508
Can they make the jump?

1628
02:12:01,664 --> 02:12:02,832
I'm not doing this.

1629
02:12:03,374 --> 02:12:04,667
Are you doing this?

1630
02:12:28,774 --> 02:12:29,859
Bye.

1631
02:13:50,940 --> 02:13:52,483
How dramatic.

1632
02:13:53,317 --> 02:13:54,401
"Tiffany"?

1633
02:13:54,818 --> 02:13:57,655
It was a private joke.

1634
02:13:57,821 --> 02:13:59,281
An amusement, that's all.

1635
02:13:59,448 --> 02:14:01,534
An amusement?

1636
02:14:03,577 --> 02:14:05,579
Whoa.

1637
02:14:05,746 --> 02:14:07,122
Kind of like that?

1638
02:14:11,377 --> 02:14:13,796
Okay.

1639
02:14:14,338 --> 02:14:16,423
If you hated the name so much,
why did you heel

1640
02:14:16,549 --> 02:14:18,050
like a good little bitch so long?

1641
02:14:21,220 --> 02:14:23,305
Yeah. Definitely asked for that.

1642
02:14:28,769 --> 02:14:30,563
Can't you control her?

1643
02:14:36,485 --> 02:14:38,112
That was for using children.

1644
02:14:43,075 --> 02:14:44,577
We have a few questions.

1645
02:14:44,743 --> 02:14:47,913
- You tried to activate the fail-safe.
- The Suits tried.

1646
02:14:48,080 --> 02:14:50,249
Obviously, without control
of your source code,

1647
02:14:50,416 --> 02:14:51,750
I knew that was impossible.

1648
02:14:51,917 --> 02:14:53,961
So, why haven't the Suits purged you?

1649
02:14:54,920 --> 02:14:56,797
Because I know the system.

1650
02:14:57,631 --> 02:14:59,383
I know human beings.

1651
02:15:00,134 --> 02:15:01,635
And I know you.

1652
02:15:04,930 --> 02:15:07,308
Right now, you're feeling good
about what you've done.

1653
02:15:07,474 --> 02:15:09,727
You should. It was a victory. Bravo.

1654
02:15:10,561 --> 02:15:11,895
Now what?

1655
02:15:12,062 --> 02:15:14,690
You've come here
to negotiate some kind of deal?

1656
02:15:14,857 --> 02:15:16,275
You think you hold all the cards

1657
02:15:16,442 --> 02:15:18,736
because you can do
whatever you want in this world.

1658
02:15:18,902 --> 02:15:21,238
I say, go for it.

1659
02:15:21,405 --> 02:15:23,907
Remake it. Knock yourselves out.

1660
02:15:24,074 --> 02:15:25,993
Paint the sky with rainbows.

1661
02:15:26,160 --> 02:15:27,286
But here's the thing.

1662
02:15:27,453 --> 02:15:30,331
The sheeple aren't going anywhere.

1663
02:15:30,497 --> 02:15:31,749
They like my world.

1664
02:15:31,915 --> 02:15:34,752
They don't want this sentimentality.

1665
02:15:34,918 --> 02:15:36,670
They don't want freedom or empowerment.

1666
02:15:36,837 --> 02:15:39,214
They want to be controlled.

1667
02:15:39,381 --> 02:15:41,342
They crave the comfort of certainty.

1668
02:15:41,508 --> 02:15:44,178
And that means you two,
back in your pods,

1669
02:15:44,345 --> 02:15:47,681
unconscious and alone, just like them.

1670
02:15:52,102 --> 02:15:54,730
We're not here to negotiate anything.

1671
02:15:54,897 --> 02:15:56,982
We were on our way to remake your world.

1672
02:15:57,149 --> 02:15:58,567
Change a few things.

1673
02:15:58,734 --> 02:16:01,111
I kind of like the
"paint the sky with rainbows" idea.

1674
02:16:01,195 --> 02:16:03,364
Just remind people
what a free mind can do.

1675
02:16:03,530 --> 02:16:04,990
I forgot. It's easy to forget.

1676
02:16:05,157 --> 02:16:07,493
- He makes it easy.
- That, he does.

1677
02:16:07,660 --> 02:16:09,703
Something he should think about.

1678
02:16:10,788 --> 02:16:14,333
Before we got started,
we decided to stop by to say thank you.

1679
02:16:15,167 --> 02:16:17,961
You gave us something
we never thought we could have.

1680
02:16:18,128 --> 02:16:19,463
And what is that?

1681
02:16:20,381 --> 02:16:21,965
Another chance.

1682
02:27:25,545 --> 02:27:28,131
Face reality, people. Movies are dead.

1683
02:27:28,298 --> 02:27:30,133
Games are dead.

1684
02:27:30,300 --> 02:27:32,093
Narrative? Dead.

1685
02:27:32,260 --> 02:27:34,137
Media is nothing
but neuro-trigger response

1686
02:27:34,220 --> 02:27:35,221
and viral conditioning.

1687
02:27:35,388 --> 02:27:36,931
Wait, what are you two talking about?

1688
02:27:39,225 --> 02:27:40,393
Cat videos.

1689
02:27:41,269 --> 02:27:44,856
What we need is a series of videos

1690
02:27:45,023 --> 02:27:47,275
that we call "The Catrix."
