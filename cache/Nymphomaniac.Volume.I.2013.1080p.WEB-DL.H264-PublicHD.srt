00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,899
Hello?

4
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:40,906
You've had an accident.

5
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:45,544
You need an ambulance.
I'll call for one.

6
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:46,745
I'll be right back.

7
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,514
Lie still here.

8
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:50,682
No.

9
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:52,951
No.

10
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:54,986
<i>No what?</i>

11
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:57,956
I don't need an ambulance.

12
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,658
<i>I can clearly see you do.</i>

13
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,526
<i>I'll call for one.</i>

14
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:04,730
In that case,
I'll be up and gone

15
00:06:04,732 --> 00:06:06,732
before you have
the time to come back.

16
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:11,069
<i>That will hurt.</i>

17
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:13,004
That's possible,

18
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:15,040
but it doesn't matter to me.

19
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,013
<i>I assume you don't want me</i>
<i>to call the police either.</i>

20
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,917
Yes, that's exactly right.

21
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:33,658
Is there anything you want?

22
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:46,438
I'd like a cup of tea
with some milk.

23
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,842
Well...

24
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,179
You have to come with me.

25
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,151
I don't serve tea
in the street.

26
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,722
Can you walk?

27
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:06,158
Yeah.

28
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:10,762
I've even bought a cake.

29
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:20,639
<i>I'll wash your clothes.</i>

30
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:23,675
- <i> Not my coat.</i>
- It smells rather badly.

31
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:25,610
It's my coat.

32
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,814
It's your coat.

33
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:33,018
So what happened?

34
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,187
Were you robbed?

35
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,726
It's my own fault.

36
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:45,797
I'm just a bad human being.

37
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,401
I've never met
a bad human being.

38
00:07:49,403 --> 00:07:50,602
Well, you have now.

39
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:54,706
Do you want to talk about it?

40
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,709
<i>You wouldn't understand.</i>

41
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:02,113
Well, try me.

42
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:06,952
But I wouldn't know
where to start.

43
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:19,998
Why is that ridiculous
fishhook hanging there?

44
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,767
<i>It's a fly.</i>

45
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:24,603
<i>I caught a fish with it once,</i>

46
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:26,137
a rather big one

47
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:27,939
strangely enough.

48
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,878
<i>Fly-fishing is about</i>

49
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,181
<i>tying feathers and
other things to a hook</i>

50
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:39,985
<i>so it resembles something</i>
<i>the fish likes to eat.</i>

51
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:42,787
And then because
the fly is very light,

52
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:45,090
you have to have
a line that is heavy.

53
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,060
It creates the velocity
when you cast.

54
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:56,635
You fish a lot?

55
00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:59,204
Well, some...

56
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:02,107
But I don't catch much.

57
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,644
<i>When I was young, I...</i>

58
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:08,246
<i>I had a book I... i worshipped.</i>

59
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:12,083
<i>It was an old book</i>
<i>by izaak walton</i>

60
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:14,553
<i>called "the complete angler."</i>

61
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:20,659
<i>It was like a romantic</i>
<i>nature Bible to me.</i>

62
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:28,266
Maybe I know where to start.

63
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,706
But if you're
to understand, I'll...

64
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:38,076
I'll have to tell you
the whole story,

65
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,111
<i>and it'll be long.</i>

66
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:44,616
Long... is good.

67
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:47,652
And moral, I'm afraid.

68
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,030
<i>To begin with the bait,</i>

69
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:02,601
<i>I discovered my cunt</i>
<i>as a two-year-old.</i>

70
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:06,838
<i>At an early age,</i>

71
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,873
<i>I was mechanically inclined.</i>

72
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,710
<i>Kinetic energy, for example,</i>

73
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:14,813
<i>- has always fascinated me.</i>

74
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:17,916
<i>And my friend...</i>
<i>let's call her b...</i>

75
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:20,385
<i>always came up with the ideas.</i>

76
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:25,323
<i>Playing frogs was</i>
<i>one of b's classics.</i>

77
00:10:49,216 --> 00:10:51,916
<i>Joe, are you all right?</i>

78
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:53,351
Just a moment!

79
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:57,155
<i>Are you done?</i>

80
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:10,835
For Christ's
sakes, leave them alone.

81
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:13,972
<i> I loved my father very much.</i>

82
00:11:13,974 --> 00:11:15,707
<i>He was a doctor.</i>

83
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:18,710
<i>My mother's name was Katherine.</i>

84
00:11:18,712 --> 00:11:20,779
<i>My father called her kay.</i>

85
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,716
<i>I suppose she was</i>
<i>what you'd call</i>

86
00:11:24,718 --> 00:11:26,317
<i>a cold bitch.</i>

87
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:28,753
<i>She always had her back turned</i>

88
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:30,689
<i>when she played solitaire.</i>

89
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:33,091
<i>I hated solitaire.</i>

90
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:40,765
<i>When we had p.E.,</i>

91
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:42,400
<i>I'd climb up into the ropes</i>

92
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:43,968
<i>and hang there for ages</i>

93
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:47,105
<i>with the rope between my legs.</i>

94
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:49,941
<i>"The sensation" we called it.</i>

95
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:54,713
<i>I remember very distinctly</i>
<i>this word, "sensation."</i>

96
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:04,989
<i>Perhaps the only difference</i>
<i>between me and other people</i>

97
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:08,993
<i>was that I've always</i>
<i>demanded more from the sunset.</i>

98
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:13,965
<i>More spectacular colors</i>
<i>when the sun hit the horizon.</i>

99
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:19,003
That's perhaps my only sin.

100
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:24,876
Why are you insisting
that children are sinful?

101
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:28,379
Not children. Me.

102
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:32,317
I don't see sin anywhere,

103
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:34,385
<i>but then I'm not religious.</i>

104
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:37,689
That's because you don't know
the rest of the story.

105
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:40,258
And by the way,
I'm not religious either.

106
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,228
Why would you take
the most unsympathetic aspect

107
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:46,164
of religion such as
the concept of sin...

108
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:50,168
And let it survive
beyond religion?

109
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:56,775
I don't understand
this self-hatred.

110
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:58,877
That's what I said...

111
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:01,312
- you wouldn't understand.
- No, I'm...

112
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,249
I'm sorry, I'll shut up.

113
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:07,786
<i>Please continue.</i>

114
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:22,801
<i>Nervus pudendus.</i>

115
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:28,940
<i>Nervus dorsalis clitoridis.</i>

116
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:03,241
<i>My dad loved telling
me about the trees and their leaves</i>

117
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:06,911
<i>and considered it</i>
<i>part of a good education.</i>

118
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,448
When the ash tree was created,

119
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:13,585
it made all the other trees
in the forest jealous.

120
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:17,088
It was the most beautiful tree.

121
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:22,560
You couldn't say
anything bad about it.

122
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:27,198
Then in the winter...

123
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:32,103
When the ash tree
lost all of its leaves...

124
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:39,210
All the trees noticed its black
buds and started laughing.

125
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,546
"Oh, look...

126
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:45,550
The ash tree's had
its fingers in the ashes."

127
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:49,287
See?

128
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:53,458
You can always tell
the ash tree in winter

129
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,226
by the black buds.

130
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:58,997
<i>He especially loved</i>

131
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:01,399
<i>the childish educational</i>
<i>stories he told</i>

132
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:04,269
<i>to help me remember</i>
<i>what I had learned.</i>

133
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:08,206
<i>I knew how much he loved</i>
<i>telling those stories,</i>

134
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:11,643
<i>so sometimes I pretended</i>
<i>I had forgotten them.</i>

135
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:22,887
Am I boring you?

136
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:25,290
<i>No, I'm
just looking forward</i>

137
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:27,592
<i>to how you will get fishing
weaved into your tale.</i>

138
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:32,230
You could start with the
fly on the wall there.

139
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:34,299
<i>It's called a nymph.</i>

140
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:38,069
It would tie in elegantly with
your discussion about nymphomania.

141
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:40,338
<i>A nymph is...</i>

142
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,541
<i>An early stage</i>
<i>in the life of an insect.</i>

143
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:48,613
<i>As a quite young nymph,</i>

144
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:52,216
it was imperative for me
to get rid of my virginity.

145
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:53,651
<i>Hopla.</i>

146
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,155
<i>I kind of knew this boy j,</i>

147
00:15:57,157 --> 00:16:00,291
<i>who had a moped.</i>

148
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,627
So in my eyes,
he was rather sophisticated.

149
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,630
<i>I was 15,</i>

150
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:10,034
<i>and perhaps my girlish romantic
expectations were a bit high.</i>

151
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:16,541
<i>But he had good strong hands.</i>

152
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:20,011
<i> I liked his hands.</i>

153
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,181
Hello?

154
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:26,317
- Hi.
- Hi.

155
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:41,933
If I asked you
to take my virginity,

156
00:16:41,935 --> 00:16:43,668
would that be a problem?

157
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:46,738
No, I don't see a problem.

158
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:53,311
So, um...

159
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,949
Where shall I go?

160
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,399
It's the fucking carburetor.

161
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:17,568
I just can't work it out.

162
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,037
Can you imagine that?

163
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,306
That's not very good.

164
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:24,475
<i>- Hmm?</i>
- That's not very good.

165
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:27,712
<i>No, it bloody isn't. It ruins the
whole idea of having a moped.</i>

166
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,384
You should probably take off
your knickers, yeah?

167
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:22,300
<i>He shoved his cock
inside me and humped me three times.</i>

168
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:34,679
<i>Then he turned me over</i>
<i>like a sack of potatoes...</i>

169
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,422
<i>Then he humped me</i>
<i>five times in the ass.</i>

170
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:55,393
<i>I never forgot
those two humiliating numbers.</i>

171
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:58,596
<i>Three and five?</i>

172
00:19:58,598 --> 00:20:00,331
Those are fibonacci numbers.

173
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:05,136
<i>That may be.</i>

174
00:20:05,138 --> 00:20:08,239
In any case, it hurt like hell.

175
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:11,742
I swore I'd never sleep
with anyone again.

176
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:14,378
<i>But of course, that only
lasted a short while.</i>

177
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:18,382
And now to get back
to your fishing...

178
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:23,387
<i>A couple of years later</i>
<i>I was at my friend b's.</i>

179
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:26,524
<i>And as always,</i>
<i>she had a new idea...</i>

180
00:20:26,526 --> 00:20:29,660
<i>Financed by her younger
brother's piggy banks,</i>

181
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:32,230
<i>which she regularly emptied.</i>

182
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,769
<i>We put on clothes later known</i>

183
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:42,240
<i>as the fuck-me-now clothes.</i>

184
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:45,910
<i>The idea was a competition.</i>

185
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:48,613
<i>We were to go on a train trip.</i>

186
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:52,617
<i>B said there was</i>
<i>no need for tickets.</i>

187
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:55,186
<i>The one who</i>
<i>had fucked the most men</i>

188
00:20:55,188 --> 00:20:57,421
<i>when we reached the destination</i>

189
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,657
<i>would win the chocolate sweets.</i>

190
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:09,300
<i>♪ Get your motor running ♪</i>

191

195
00:21:22,682 --> 00:21:24,448
<i>May I interrupt here?</i>

196
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:26,817
What you were doing

197
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:28,786
when you walked down
that corridor...

198
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:31,355
You were reading the river.

199
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:39,497
<i>♪ Born to be wild... ♪</i>

200
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:46,904
<i>Most of the
large fish stay sheltered</i>

201
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:48,873
<i>from the current to save energy</i>

202
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:51,008
<i>- and to hide from the prey.</i>

203
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,777
<i>Where the fish hides</i>
<i>in the stream</i>

204
00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:55,079
<i>entails a very</i>
<i>complicated hierarchy.</i>

205
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:58,449
<i>The topography decides</i>

206
00:21:58,451 --> 00:22:00,551
<i>where the most</i>
<i>attractive places are,</i>

207
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:03,387
<i>and the biggest fish</i>
<i>choose the best positions.</i>

208
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:10,294
<i>Smile and make eye contact.</i>

209
00:22:10,296 --> 00:22:13,431
If you have to talk, remember
to ask a lot of wh-questions

210
00:22:13,433 --> 00:22:15,366
if you want more
than a yes-or-no answer.

211
00:22:15,368 --> 00:22:17,001
Then it'll just
happen on its own.

212
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:19,403
You just take them to the lavatory
and you have sex with them.

213
00:22:19,405 --> 00:22:23,007
Oh. But what if it's nasty?

214
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:26,410
Then you just think of the
bag of chocolate sweeties.

215
00:22:57,642 --> 00:23:01,011
What... what time is it?

216
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:04,882
10:00

217
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:21,632
<i>Where do you come from?</i>

218
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:24,835
From home.

219
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:34,779
Who knows where
the lavatory is?

220
00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:36,514
<i>Well, if you take a right,</i>

221
00:23:36,516 --> 00:23:40,084
you will arrive at a lavatory
at the end of the car.

222
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:43,053
At the same time,
it is so cleverly arranged

223
00:23:43,055 --> 00:23:44,555
that if you take a left turn,

224
00:23:44,557 --> 00:23:47,057
you will also arrive
at a lavatory,

225
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:50,428
<i>since at the end of the
next car there is also one.</i>

226
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:55,533
I'll show you where
the lavatory is.

227
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:25,830
<i>It turned out
to be shockingly easy.</i>

228
00:24:25,832 --> 00:24:28,632
<i>In no time, b was ahead,</i>
<i>five to three.</i>

229
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:31,435
And it was exactly right...

230
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:33,471
look them in the eye and smile.

231
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:36,574
But then suddenly it stopped.

232
00:24:36,576 --> 00:24:40,578
That's a very clear parallel
to fishing in the stream.

233
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:42,646
As it happens,

234
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:44,415
either none
of the fish are feeding

235
00:24:44,417 --> 00:24:46,550
or they all feed
at the same time.

236
00:24:46,552 --> 00:24:48,752
They go into feeding frenzy.

237
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:50,488
All bite.

238
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:53,891
And then just as suddenly
as it started, it stops.

239
00:24:53,893 --> 00:24:56,994
The fish most readily bite at
the beginning of a light rain,

240
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:59,430
and I think that's
because they feel safe

241
00:24:59,432 --> 00:25:01,098
when they swim in the stream.

242
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,834
Because they can't
be seen from above.

243
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:06,504
The water's surface
is disturbed.

244
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,608
But then it started again,

245
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:13,444
although a bit more slowly.

246
00:25:13,446 --> 00:25:15,946
Yeah, and I think I know how.

247
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:18,849
Because fly-fishing can
be done in several phases.

248
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:23,153
And if the fish stop biting,
you move on to phase two.

249
00:25:23,155 --> 00:25:26,757
And in phase two,
you not only imitate an insect

250
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:29,226
but an insect in trouble.

251
00:25:29,228 --> 00:25:32,596
You pull... you pull the line.

252
00:25:32,598 --> 00:25:35,566
You tug it... Irregularly,

253
00:25:35,568 --> 00:25:37,501
<i>so the fish gets</i>
<i>the impression that</i>

254
00:25:37,503 --> 00:25:40,137
it's dealing with an
injured and easy prey.

255
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:42,206
And then helplessly

256
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:45,209
<i>let the fly float</i>
<i>down the river again.</i>

257
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:47,077
Then half-heartedly

258
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:49,079
<i>make a few jumps forward again.</i>

259
00:25:50,982 --> 00:25:52,750
It can be done...

260
00:25:52,752 --> 00:25:54,718
It can be done very elegantly.

261
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:10,034
Are you all right?

262
00:26:10,036 --> 00:26:11,769
It's Betty.

263
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,706
I was just told
that she's very ill.

264
00:26:15,708 --> 00:26:18,275
Is Betty a close family member?

265
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:23,280
You could say that.

266
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:26,216
She's my dwarf hamster.

267
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:28,052
<i>Dwarf hamster?</i>

268
00:26:28,054 --> 00:26:30,054
<i>You can't be serious.</i>

269
00:26:30,056 --> 00:26:32,056
<i>Well, what was I to do?</i>

270
00:26:32,058 --> 00:26:35,693
<i>And then I did have a dwarf
hamster when I was young.</i>

271
00:26:35,695 --> 00:26:38,128
<i>That you were
very close to?</i>-

272
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,264
<i>Not at all.
A bloody nuisance.</i>

273
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:42,132
<i>Dwarf hamster.</i>

274
00:26:42,134 --> 00:26:44,868
It would've been worse
if it were a person.

275
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:47,037
<i>Don't say that.</i>

276
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,741
I'm extremely fond
of my hamster.

277
00:26:50,743 --> 00:26:54,812
Yes, I think that's a rather
cynical thing to say about Betty.

278
00:26:54,814 --> 00:26:59,683
Yes, I had made the cage
nice and cozy for her when...

279
00:26:59,685 --> 00:27:02,152
- <i> when I got her.</i>
- And Betty liked that?

280
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,656
Betty was excited.

281
00:27:05,658 --> 00:27:10,060
<i>One of nature's
most meaningless creatures.</i>

282
00:27:10,062 --> 00:27:12,930
<i>You're aware
that the choice of a dwarf hamster</i>

283
00:27:12,932 --> 00:27:16,033
<i>possibly suggests</i>
<i>certain sexual connotations.</i>

284
00:27:16,035 --> 00:27:17,668
<i>I can see that now,</i>

285
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:20,771
<i>but it was really</i>
<i>not a conscious choice.</i>

286
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:33,117
Can you show me
where the lavatory is?

287
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:37,321
I... have to blow my nose.

288
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:52,002
<i>We were
running out of subjects,</i>

289
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:54,271
<i>and b was ahead on points,</i>

290
00:27:54,273 --> 00:27:58,275
<i>which led us to s's</i>
<i>first-class compartment.</i>

291
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:04,348
<i>Tickets, please!</i>

292
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:11,288
Thank you.

293
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,690
<i>Ladies?</i>

294
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,359
Tickets?

295
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:22,766
<i>Well...</i>

296
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:26,904
I think I might've lost it.

297
00:28:26,906 --> 00:28:28,138
<i>Perhaps.</i>

298
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:32,076
Dropped yours as well, did ya?

299
00:28:32,078 --> 00:28:36,080
I haven't bought a ticket
for your shitty train.

300
00:28:36,082 --> 00:28:38,148
It's so bloody slow,

301
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:40,117
we should've been at the end
of the track half an hour ago.

302
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:43,287
Regardless of delays, you still
need a ticket, sweetheart.

303
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:45,823
£8 each, please.

304
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,259
Oh!

305
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:53,263
I accidentally tore it up.

306
00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:56,300
<i>You can't expect be to pay</i>
<i>for scraps of paper.</i>

307
00:28:56,302 --> 00:28:58,669
- Have another one.
- Oh, great idea.

308
00:28:58,671 --> 00:29:00,871
Oh, that one's disappeared too.

309
00:29:00,873 --> 00:29:02,940
<i>I can
always just get the police</i>

310
00:29:02,942 --> 00:29:04,942
to collect your payment
at the next station.

311
00:29:04,944 --> 00:29:07,044
How about that? - Now let's
just take it easy here, shall we?

312
00:29:07,046 --> 00:29:10,047
Apparently the young ladies
have left without any money.

313
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:12,349
If it's okay with you, I'd
like to pay for their tickets.

314
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:15,252
No sir, it's not. Just leave
your money where it is.

315
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:17,121
We'll let the police deal
with these two. - Actually,

316
00:29:17,123 --> 00:29:19,723
we did have sort of an
agreement that I was to pay.

317
00:29:19,725 --> 00:29:21,058
I just forgot about it.

318
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,696
I see.

319
00:29:25,698 --> 00:29:28,265
Two first-class tickets...

320
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:30,868
For two first-class ladies.

321
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:34,171
<i>Enjoy the rest of your journey.</i>

322
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:38,809
<i>Tickets, please!</i>

323
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:43,947
Now that you've
been so nice to us...

324
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:47,951
We'd like to be
nice to you too.

325
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:49,486
<i>Oh, that's very kind of you,</i>

326
00:29:49,488 --> 00:29:50,954
<i>but there's no need.</i>

327
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,027
I mean that.

328
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,900
Well, I've already lost anyway.

329
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:09,373
I'm willing to give you
five extra points...

330
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,077
If you can get
that one in there.

331
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:19,850
<i>I decided,
perhaps a bit desperately,</i>

332
00:30:19,852 --> 00:30:21,952
<i>that the only thing</i>
<i>standing between me</i>

333
00:30:21,954 --> 00:30:23,987
<i>and the bag of chocolate sweets</i>

334
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:28,358
<i>was an unequivocal</i>
<i>provocation of this man.</i>

335
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,061
<i>Excellent. An induced take.</i>

336
00:30:31,063 --> 00:30:33,463
<i>When all other attempts fail,</i>

337
00:30:33,465 --> 00:30:35,265
<i>a dramatic provocation can get</i>

338
00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:38,001
<i>an otherwise completely</i>
<i>passive fish to bite.</i>

339
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:41,205
<i>They will react instinctively</i>
<i>to the right provocation,</i>

340
00:30:41,207 --> 00:30:44,041
<i>which would not be a fly,</i>
<i>but, for instance,</i>

341
00:30:44,043 --> 00:30:47,845
<i>a brightly-colored wobbler,</i>
<i>preferably red.</i>

342
00:30:47,847 --> 00:30:50,347
<i>The very best is one we call</i>
<i>"the Finnish weapon,"</i>

343
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:53,050
<i>the so-called rapala.</i>

344
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:57,387
<i>You've bought a gift.</i>

345
00:30:59,123 --> 00:31:00,591
Yes.

346
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,494
- It's for my wife.
- <i> Oh.</i>

347
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:07,564
You travel first-class

348
00:31:07,566 --> 00:31:10,234
and you bought us our tickets.

349
00:31:10,236 --> 00:31:14,338
<i>Why then not buy</i>
<i>a decent gift for your wife?</i>

350
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:17,407
I can see it comes
from the station.

351
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:25,415
<i>Of course, I should have...</i>

352
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:27,017
<i>Bought her something...</i>

353
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:29,953
something better, but...

354
00:31:29,955 --> 00:31:33,357
<i>Let's just say I was suddenly
in a hurry to get home.</i>

355
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:37,861
<i>Why would a man like you</i>

356
00:31:37,863 --> 00:31:40,964
with such an orderly life
suddenly have to hurry?

357
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:46,403
It has to do with family.

358
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:51,541
My wife and I
have decided that we...

359
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:57,547
We miss having children
after all,

360
00:31:57,549 --> 00:32:00,350
and that if we are to have
children, it has to be now.

361
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:06,056
So my wife called yesterday
to say that she...

362
00:32:06,058 --> 00:32:08,425
<i>she started ovulating.</i>

363
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:12,896
<i>And all signs point</i>
<i>to maximum fertility</i>

364
00:32:12,898 --> 00:32:15,065
<i>precisely tonight.</i>

365
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:17,100
You see...

366
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:20,270
That's why I bought her
a gift at the station.

367
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:23,206
<i>I had to get a ticket home</i>
<i>as quickly as possible.</i>

368
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:26,977
Well, I understand now.

369
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:29,413
<i>What is it you understand?</i>

370
00:32:29,415 --> 00:32:32,115
Why you didn't
have sex with us.

371
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:38,622
It wasn't because
I didn't want to.

372
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:57,140
<i>Please.</i>

373
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:04,014
I'm begging you, please don't.

374
00:33:04,016 --> 00:33:06,049
It's okay.

375
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:08,719
Please don't.

376
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:13,190
You've been as horny as hell...

377
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:16,326
But you wouldn't
give up your load.

378
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:19,129
Please stop.

379
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:46,023
Oh God.

380
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:48,492
Oh God.

381
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:07,744
Wow.

382
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:22,392
<i>So oral sex</i>

383
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:24,995
became, in the eye
of the angler,

384
00:34:24,997 --> 00:34:27,464
<i>your... your Finnish weapon.</i>

385
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:31,635
<i>Is that your only comment?</i>

386
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:35,839
What else... what else
do you want me to say?

387
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:40,110
That I behaved reprehensively,

388
00:34:40,112 --> 00:34:44,114
that already my actions
exemplify that I'm a...

389
00:34:44,116 --> 00:34:46,283
I'm a terrible human being.

390
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:49,719
That's not the way I see it.

391
00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:51,788
On the contrary,
I saw it as a...

392
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:55,025
as a very pleasurable
and humorous story.

393
00:34:55,027 --> 00:34:58,562
I've consciously
used and hurt others...

394
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:02,732
For the sake
of my own satisfaction.

395
00:35:02,734 --> 00:35:05,669
And what I've told you so far
only begins to suggest that.

396
00:35:05,671 --> 00:35:07,204
<i>But when you told</i>
<i>the story, you were...</i>

397
00:35:07,206 --> 00:35:10,640
you were cheerful,
full of humor.

398
00:35:10,642 --> 00:35:13,043
<i>The only thing you've done...</i>

399
00:35:13,045 --> 00:35:16,046
Except giving a few people
an experience to remember

400
00:35:16,048 --> 00:35:20,117
is that you... you
relieved s from his load

401
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:23,320
<i>in some... some youthful hubris.</i>

402
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:28,258
And I read somewhere that
if you keep the load too long,

403
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,793
the sperm will die.

404
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:31,862
<i>Or worse, degenerate.</i>

405
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:34,731
Maybe thanks to you,

406
00:35:34,733 --> 00:35:36,566
Mr. s and his wife
now have a healthy

407
00:35:36,568 --> 00:35:38,568
<i>and well-functioning child.</i>

408
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:42,305
I discovered my power as woman

409
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:45,442
and used it without any
concern for others.

410
00:35:45,444 --> 00:35:48,145
<i>That's completely unacceptable.</i>

411
00:35:48,147 --> 00:35:50,113
Oh, little darling.

412
00:35:50,115 --> 00:35:51,781
Don't you "little darling" me.

413
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:55,852
No.

414
00:35:58,456 --> 00:36:00,557
What I wanted to say was that

415
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:03,593
if you have wings, why not fly?

416
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:38,695
No more stories.

417
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:42,432
You need to sleep.

418
00:36:42,434 --> 00:36:44,234
No no.

419
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:47,504
This is beginning to amuse me.

420
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:56,246
I don't even know your name.

421
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:59,316
My name is Joe.

422
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:01,785
<i>I'm seligman.</i>

423
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:05,855
What a fucking ridiculous name.

424
00:37:07,226 --> 00:37:09,259
It's Jewish.

425
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:12,395
You said you weren't religious.

426
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:14,664
No, but my
great-grandfather was.

427
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:16,233
And my parents gave me the name

428
00:37:16,235 --> 00:37:18,235
as a sort of...

429
00:37:18,237 --> 00:37:22,305
<i>Sentimental association</i>
<i>to judaism.</i>

430
00:37:22,307 --> 00:37:25,542
But we've always been
anti-zionists...

431
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:30,347
Which is not the same
as being anti-semitic,

432
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:33,750
as certain political powers
try to convince us.

433
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:36,720
Seligman...

434
00:37:36,722 --> 00:37:39,456
Means "the happy one."

435
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,728
So are you happy then?

436
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:49,566
Well, I suppose I am...

437
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:52,402
In my own way.

438
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:55,205
Even if I'm the kind of person

439
00:37:55,207 --> 00:37:57,274
who cut the nails
of the right hand first.

440
00:37:57,276 --> 00:37:58,408
What does that mean?

441
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,911
Well, I divide humanity
into two groups:

442
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:04,714
The people who cut the nails
on the left hand first

443
00:38:04,716 --> 00:38:06,583
and the people
who cut the nails

444
00:38:06,585 --> 00:38:09,319
of the right hand first.
My theory is

445
00:38:09,321 --> 00:38:11,821
<i>that the people who cut the
nails of the left hand first,</i>

446
00:38:11,823 --> 00:38:14,357
<i>they... they...</i>
<i>they're more light-hearted.</i>

447
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:16,626
They have a tendency
to enjoy life more

448
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:20,363
because they go straight
for the easiest task and...

449
00:38:20,365 --> 00:38:23,733
Save their difficulties
for later.

450
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:30,340
So what do you do?

451
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:33,510
Always the left hand first.

452
00:38:33,512 --> 00:38:35,578
I don't think there's a choice.

453
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:39,382
Go for the pleasure
first, always.

454
00:38:39,384 --> 00:38:42,452
And then once
you've done the left hand,

455
00:38:42,454 --> 00:38:44,888
only the right hand remains,

456
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:48,091
and that's
the easiest one left.

457
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:57,334
I've never thought
of it like that.

458
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:02,505
Well, you...
you're never too old...

459
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:04,007
never too old to learn.

460
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:13,850
<i>That's rugelach.</i>

461
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:17,587
Mm-hmm. It's a Jewish cake.

462
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:19,356
<i>There's that</i>
<i>sentimentality again.</i>

463
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:21,291
No, but it's more
than rugelach.

464
00:39:21,293 --> 00:39:23,893
<i>It's rugelach served</i>
<i>with a cake fork.</i>

465
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:28,031
Rugelach, in my opinion,
is pastry,

466
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:31,701
which there is no excuse for
eating with a cake fork.

467
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:35,472
To serve it with a cake fork
is irritatingly unmanly,

468
00:39:35,474 --> 00:39:38,074
<i>not to say downright feminine.</i>

469
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:43,947
However it can bring us
further with the story.

470
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:50,754
I also knew someone who
consumed rugelach every day,

471
00:39:50,756 --> 00:39:53,757
almost ritually,
with a cake fork.

472
00:39:53,759 --> 00:39:56,826
<i>And although we'll be</i>
<i>jumping a bit in time...</i>

473
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:01,398
<i>I have to tell you</i>
<i>about Jerome.</i>

474
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,534
As far as I can see, the
next chapter doesn't contain

475
00:40:04,536 --> 00:40:07,637
as direct an accusation
against my person

476
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:10,006
as the rest of the story.

477
00:40:10,008 --> 00:40:14,444
The chapter will also make a
sentimental soul like you happy,

478
00:40:14,446 --> 00:40:19,416
as it contains observations
on the subject of love.

479
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:25,582
Can I tell you something?

480
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:28,651
Sure.

481
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:30,520
Sure.

482
00:41:30,522 --> 00:41:31,654
Yeah.

483
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:32,789
Yeah sure.

484
00:41:32,791 --> 00:41:34,691
It might not be
important to you...

485
00:41:34,693 --> 00:41:35,892
But it is to me.

486
00:41:35,894 --> 00:41:37,760
But it is to me.

487
00:41:37,762 --> 00:41:40,763
I've never had
an orgasm before.

488
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:45,902
Really?

489
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:52,108
You're my first one.

490
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:56,913
You don't know
how happy that makes me.

491
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:03,186
I love you.

492
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:10,026
You're my first.

493
00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:15,832
Well, I have to admit:

494
00:42:15,834 --> 00:42:18,201
Quite a lot of girls say that.

495
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:24,474
<i>The train trip
had increased my appetite,</i>

496
00:42:24,476 --> 00:42:26,776
<i>and soon b and I started a club</i>

497
00:42:26,778 --> 00:42:30,480
<i> that we called the little flock.</i>

498
00:42:30,482 --> 00:42:34,050
<i>Mea vulva,
mea maxima vulva.</i>

499
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:35,852
<i>B, of
course, took the lead,</i>

500
00:42:35,854 --> 00:42:38,254
<i>as she was</i>
<i>the most daring of us.</i>

501
00:42:38,256 --> 00:42:40,156
<i>She was raised catholic.</i>

502
00:42:40,158 --> 00:42:42,559
<i>I'm sure you're familiar</i>
<i>with the practices</i>

503
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:44,093
<i>of the catholic church.</i>

504
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:46,563
<i>Mea maxima vulva.</i>

505
00:42:46,565 --> 00:42:48,731
<i>Mea vulva, mea...</i>

506
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:50,333
<i>That's interesting.</i>

507
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:53,636
Blasphemic, satanic.

508
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:56,005
The music...

509
00:42:56,007 --> 00:42:58,141
the interval between b and f...

510
00:42:58,143 --> 00:43:00,076
it's a tritone,

511
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:02,078
the devil's interval.

512
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:05,048
It was banned from music
in the middle ages.

513
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:09,085
Well, the vacuum cleaner
invented it.

514
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:11,187
She took piano lessons.

515
00:43:11,189 --> 00:43:13,289
The vacuum cleaner?

516
00:43:13,291 --> 00:43:14,924
<i>The vacuum cleaner possessed</i>

517
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:18,061
<i>a special talent</i>
<i>for floppy cocks.</i>

518
00:43:18,063 --> 00:43:21,598
<i>She had some kind</i>
<i>of vacuum in her cunt.</i>

519
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:25,668
I... I was imagining
something like that.

520
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:27,170
It was about fucking

521
00:43:27,172 --> 00:43:29,906
and about having
the right to be horny.

522
00:43:29,908 --> 00:43:33,977
We masturbated together,
that kind of thing.

523
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,813
But it was rebellious.

524
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:40,883
We weren't allowed
to have boyfriends.

525
00:43:40,885 --> 00:43:43,720
No fucking the same guy
more than once.

526
00:43:43,722 --> 00:43:45,788
What did you rebel against?

527
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:47,256
Love.

528
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:49,892
Love?

529
00:43:49,894 --> 00:43:52,095
We were committed to combat

530
00:43:52,097 --> 00:43:54,364
the love-fixated society.

531
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:10,747
<i>I really
believed in our little flock,</i>

532
00:44:10,749 --> 00:44:13,149
<i>but of course,</i>
<i>that was naive of me.</i>

533
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:16,753
<i>Over time, even the strongest</i>

534
00:44:16,755 --> 00:44:18,921
<i>couldn't stay true</i>
<i>to our manifest.</i>

535
00:44:18,923 --> 00:44:20,323
<i>-  Third of the fifth.</i>

536
00:44:20,325 --> 00:44:23,092
My third intercourse this week,

537
00:44:23,094 --> 00:44:25,328
- again with Alex.
- Third.

538
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:30,366
Haven't we stated
that we fuck each guy once?

539
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:35,638
I don't think
you can understand Alex.

540
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,707
I don't want to.

541
00:44:37,709 --> 00:44:39,909
- Our relationship...
- Relationship?

542
00:44:39,911 --> 00:44:41,744
There you are.

543
00:44:41,746 --> 00:44:46,215
Do you think you know
everything about sex?

544
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:54,290
The secret
ingredient to sex... is love.

545
00:45:00,664 --> 00:45:04,934
For me, love was just
lust with jealousy added.

546
00:45:04,936 --> 00:45:08,137
Everything else
was total nonsense.

547
00:45:08,139 --> 00:45:12,809
For every hundred crimes
committed in the name of love,

548
00:45:12,811 --> 00:45:15,912
only one is committed
in the name of sex.

549
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:18,214
That's quite a statement.

550
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:21,050
Well, it all
strengthened my wish

551
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:23,086
for a serious education.

552
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:37,266
Glasgow.

553
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:42,371
Aberdeen.

554
00:45:44,308 --> 00:45:45,942
<i>Why are you smiling?</i>

555
00:45:45,944 --> 00:45:49,812
Oh, I just pictured
how an education

556
00:45:49,814 --> 00:45:51,948
would be conveyed in your storytelling.

557
00:45:53,117 --> 00:45:55,051
Well, that's nothing
to smile about.

558
00:45:55,053 --> 00:45:57,353
I understand that.

559
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:01,791
So what kind
of education did you get?

560
00:46:01,793 --> 00:46:05,428
I began studying medicine
like my father.

561
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:08,898
<i>But it was harder and harder
for me to concentrate,</i>

562
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:13,336
<i>so I studied less and less
till finally I dropped out.</i>

563
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:18,040
So instead I began
to look for a job.

564
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,745
<i>It turned out</i>
<i>it was hard to get a job</i>

565
00:46:22,747 --> 00:46:25,047
<i>that paid</i>
<i>even halfway decently.</i>

566
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,918
<i>I didn't really know</i>
<i>how to do anything,</i>

567
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:31,454
<i>so I didn't have high hopes</i>

568
00:46:31,456 --> 00:46:33,089
<i>when I applied for a position</i>

569
00:46:33,091 --> 00:46:35,491
<i>as an assistant</i>
<i>at a printing house.</i>

570
00:46:35,493 --> 00:46:39,095
So could you tell me
a little bit more

571
00:46:39,097 --> 00:46:41,798
<i>about your background?</i>

572
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:46,068
- Um...
- <i> Education-wise.</i>

573
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:49,172
Oh. Well,
I finished high school

574
00:46:49,174 --> 00:46:52,842
and decided
to study medicine...

575
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:56,045
But I didn't finish.

576
00:46:56,047 --> 00:46:58,815
<i>I know it sounds</i>
<i>a bit pointless coming here.</i>

577
00:46:58,817 --> 00:47:01,250
- Right.
- <i> I just really need a job</i>

578
00:47:01,252 --> 00:47:03,286
and I've tried everywhere.

579
00:47:03,288 --> 00:47:05,288
<i>I don't usually</i>
<i>give jobs to people</i>

580
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:07,256
just because they need one.

581
00:47:07,258 --> 00:47:11,160
What about secretarial skills?

582
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:15,898
- Do you have any of those?
- No, I didn't think you needed skills.

583
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:18,968
You didn't think you needed skills

584
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:21,470
for this position
as a secretary?

585
00:47:21,472 --> 00:47:23,139
No.

586
00:47:23,141 --> 00:47:24,774
<i>Can you open an envelope?</i>

587
00:47:24,776 --> 00:47:28,477
Yeah, I... yes, I think
I can open an envelope.

588
00:47:28,479 --> 00:47:30,880
<i>Well, I'm glad to hear that.</i>

589
00:47:32,049 --> 00:47:34,116
I shall discuss
this conversation

590
00:47:34,118 --> 00:47:36,919
with Mr. Jerome, my boss.

591
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:42,491
<i>Do you think
there's a chance?</i>

592
00:47:42,493 --> 00:47:44,227
I doubt it.

593
00:47:44,229 --> 00:47:46,162
Oh.

594
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:08,050
Well, apparently

595
00:48:08,052 --> 00:48:10,586
having absolutely no experience

596
00:48:10,588 --> 00:48:12,822
is absolutely fine
for this job.

597
00:48:12,824 --> 00:48:14,991
You've got it.

598
00:48:14,993 --> 00:48:17,426
Oh.

599
00:48:17,428 --> 00:48:19,962
Does that mean
I should start tomorrow?

600
00:48:19,964 --> 00:48:22,198
Yeah, I suppose it does.

601
00:48:23,967 --> 00:48:25,334
<i>Good morning.</i>

602
00:48:25,336 --> 00:48:26,535
<i>Right.</i>

603
00:48:34,279 --> 00:48:35,912
Yes?

604
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:40,850
- Good morning, sir.
- <i> Good morning.</i>

605
00:48:40,852 --> 00:48:42,218
I just wanted to introduce you

606
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:44,086
<i>to our new</i>
<i>junior secretary. Joe?</i>

607
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:46,088
<i>I believe you wanted</i>
<i>to explain her work duties.</i>

608
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:47,957
- Hi.
- This is the new junior secretary, sir.

609
00:48:47,959 --> 00:48:49,292
<i>Liz, can I have another coffee?</i>

610
00:48:49,294 --> 00:48:51,294
- Yes, of course, sir.
- Thank you.

611
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:55,431
Hi.

612
00:48:59,136 --> 00:49:00,636
Jerome?

613
00:49:00,638 --> 00:49:03,039
<i>Your first love.</i>

614
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:10,613
I bet you didn't think I'd make
something of myself, right?

615
00:49:10,615 --> 00:49:12,615
And now here I sit,

616
00:49:12,617 --> 00:49:15,651
the director's chair
of m&j Morris ltd.

617
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:20,423
Yes, quite surprising.

618
00:49:20,425 --> 00:49:22,058
Surprising?

619
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:23,960
It's a sign from God.

620
00:49:28,332 --> 00:49:30,433
You know, I've thought
about you often since then.

621
00:49:32,202 --> 00:49:33,569
<i>Have you thought of me?</i>

622
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:39,208
- Well...
- <i> Ah.</i>

623
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:41,544
Usually, you know,
my Uncle sits here.

624
00:49:41,546 --> 00:49:44,046
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>- But he's developed
a bit of a tummy problem,

625
00:49:44,048 --> 00:49:45,915
so he's at the spa,
taking long baths,

626
00:49:45,917 --> 00:49:47,616
drinking lots of water.
Poor guy.

627
00:49:47,618 --> 00:49:49,452
<i>And no one knows for how long,</i>

628
00:49:49,454 --> 00:49:52,588
so now I'm the j
in m&j Morris ltd.

629
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:54,657
How about that?

630
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:58,394
<i>We print cards and envelopes
and nonsense like that.</i>

631
00:49:58,396 --> 00:50:00,329
It's a bloody complicated
business, you know.

632
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:01,664
I don't understand
a word of it.

633
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:05,668
Come on, I'll show
you around. Yes?

634
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:07,370
- Liz?
- Yes sir?

635
00:50:07,372 --> 00:50:09,605
Oh, look, there you are.
Good job.

636
00:50:09,607 --> 00:50:12,074
Every time you do a good job,
I say, "good job, Liz."

637
00:50:12,076 --> 00:50:13,609
- Thank you, sir.
- What's her name?

638
00:50:13,611 --> 00:50:15,478
- Liz.
- "Good job, Liz."

639
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,646
- Good job, Liz.
- Good job, Liz!

640
00:50:17,648 --> 00:50:19,982
This is Bobby. Bobby, say hello.
This is Joe.

641
00:50:19,984 --> 00:50:22,518
<i>- Hello.</i>
- He does the business cards.

642
00:50:36,501 --> 00:50:37,967
It stopped.

643
00:50:37,969 --> 00:50:39,802
Fuck.

644
00:50:43,106 --> 00:50:44,240
Yes.

645
00:50:45,742 --> 00:50:47,443
Well, isn't there an alarm?

646
00:50:47,445 --> 00:50:49,145
To which?

647
00:50:49,147 --> 00:50:51,981
- Isn't there an alarm?
- Alarm, all right, yes.

648
00:50:51,983 --> 00:50:55,151
Good thinking. I'll press this.

649
00:50:57,687 --> 00:50:59,588
Imagine...

650
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:02,291
You look just as great
all these years later.

651
00:51:02,293 --> 00:51:04,060
Oh no.

652
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:09,632
No.

653
00:51:09,634 --> 00:51:11,067
<i>No?</i>

654
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:14,437
- Wha...?
- No, Jerome, this won't work.

655
00:51:14,439 --> 00:51:17,273
- Which won't work?
- This.

656
00:51:19,609 --> 00:51:20,843
Why not?

657
00:51:22,012 --> 00:51:23,512
You're not really my type.

658
00:51:25,715 --> 00:51:27,616
That's how it's gonna be?

659
00:51:27,618 --> 00:51:30,252
- <i> Yes.</i>
- All right.

660
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:38,094
Fuck's sake.

661
00:51:47,637 --> 00:51:49,305
Okay.

662
00:51:59,049 --> 00:52:01,383
<i>- Umm...</i>
- Give me your hand.

663
00:52:02,686 --> 00:52:04,620
In a fireman's grip.

664
00:52:05,555 --> 00:52:06,622
Ooh!

665
00:52:06,624 --> 00:52:08,190
- You okay?
- Yeah.

666
00:52:10,594 --> 00:52:13,195
Why didn't you
have sex with him?

667
00:52:14,164 --> 00:52:15,498
I'm not quite sure.

668
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:18,134
I've shagged lots of idiots.

669
00:52:18,136 --> 00:52:20,503
I suppose he fired you then.

670
00:52:20,505 --> 00:52:22,605
No. If he had fired me,

671
00:52:22,607 --> 00:52:24,206
then he would've lost.

672
00:52:27,677 --> 00:52:31,247
<i>As I didn't recall anyone</i>
<i>having defined my work duties,</i>

673
00:52:31,249 --> 00:52:34,917
<i>I decided to clean up in
order to smooth the waters.</i>

674
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:45,294
<i>- Good morning, sir.</i>
- Any calls?

675
00:52:45,296 --> 00:52:46,595
No sir.

676
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:53,836
What have you done?

677
00:52:55,105 --> 00:52:56,772
Oh. I cleaned up.

678
00:52:56,774 --> 00:52:58,307
You cleaned up?

679
00:52:58,309 --> 00:53:00,776
It... it was quite messy and...

680
00:53:00,778 --> 00:53:02,444
- Liz?
- Yes sir?

681
00:53:02,446 --> 00:53:04,413
She cleaned up.

682
00:53:04,415 --> 00:53:07,349
I know... I didn't know, sir.

683
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:09,652
- I was away from my desk.
- Are you completely mad?

684
00:53:16,259 --> 00:53:18,360
What is the tea
and pastry doing here?

685
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:20,462
I thought that's what
you wanted for breakfast.

686
00:53:20,464 --> 00:53:21,830
<i>You thought? Mmm!</i>

687
00:53:21,832 --> 00:53:23,265
You're not supposed to think.

688
00:53:23,267 --> 00:53:24,567
I don't pay you to think, do I?

689
00:53:24,569 --> 00:53:25,734
This is a do-over.

690
00:53:25,736 --> 00:53:27,469
<i>- A do-over?</i>
<i>- Right.</i>

691
00:53:27,471 --> 00:53:29,638
Pick it up, take it outside

692
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,207
and do it again.

693
00:53:42,419 --> 00:53:44,887
One moment.

694
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:55,531
Come in.

695
00:53:57,867 --> 00:54:00,269
Would now be a good time
for some tea and cake?

696
00:54:00,271 --> 00:54:01,770
Sure, why not.

697
00:54:03,807 --> 00:54:05,674
Where the fuck is my cake fork?

698
00:54:05,676 --> 00:54:06,842
<i>Cake fork?</i>

699
00:54:06,844 --> 00:54:08,544
- <i> Right.</i>
- Well...

700
00:54:08,546 --> 00:54:10,179
I would've got you one,

701
00:54:10,181 --> 00:54:12,448
but it just...
Feels inappropriate.

702
00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:32,201
Unmanly.

703
00:54:32,203 --> 00:54:33,502
Feminine.

704
00:54:33,504 --> 00:54:35,437
On the other hand,

705
00:54:35,439 --> 00:54:37,473
you must say
that a cake fork is...

706
00:54:37,475 --> 00:54:39,642
is a rather practical tool.

707
00:54:41,378 --> 00:54:45,214
It's like a cross between
a knife and a fork.

708
00:54:45,216 --> 00:54:47,283
<i>The point is</i>
<i>that you're supposed</i>

709
00:54:47,285 --> 00:54:48,917
<i>to be able to hold</i>
<i>the cake dish with one hand,</i>

710
00:54:48,919 --> 00:54:50,886
then cut it with the other...

711
00:54:51,888 --> 00:54:55,491
And then eat it with the fork.

712
00:54:55,493 --> 00:54:57,993
It's not feminine. It's at least
bourgeois. -

713
00:54:59,329 --> 00:55:01,764
It's said that the...
the bolsheviks

714
00:55:01,766 --> 00:55:03,766
<i>during their rampage</i>
<i>through Russia,</i>

715
00:55:03,768 --> 00:55:05,567
<i>to separate</i>
<i>the men from the boys,</i>

716
00:55:05,569 --> 00:55:08,604
<i>or rather the bourgeoisie</i>
<i>from the proletariat,</i>

717
00:55:08,606 --> 00:55:10,005
<i>they brought a boy,</i>

718
00:55:10,007 --> 00:55:11,707
<i>and before burning down a house</i>

719
00:55:11,709 --> 00:55:15,311
<i>they sent him in to make sure</i>
<i>they had cake forks.</i>

720
00:55:19,616 --> 00:55:21,583
That's not true.

721
00:55:24,921 --> 00:55:27,489
I don't have
the story first-hand.

722
00:55:27,491 --> 00:55:30,993
<i>- Hello.</i>
<i>- Hi.</i>

723
00:55:30,995 --> 00:55:34,263
Hi, I was wondering
if you could help me.

724
00:55:34,265 --> 00:55:36,332
It's suddenly gone very dirty.

725
00:55:38,568 --> 00:55:41,403
See, you put your
dirty fingers on there.

726
00:55:41,405 --> 00:55:43,372
Maybe we should
wash your hands.

727
00:55:43,374 --> 00:55:44,940
Yeah, better.

728
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,644
Mm-hmm.

729
00:55:48,646 --> 00:55:50,679
You must be very talented.

730
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:52,614
- Yeah sure.
- Mmm.

731
00:56:00,757 --> 00:56:02,958
<i>If you had asked
Jerome, he would've said</i>

732
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,060
<i>that I was the one</i>
<i>who had declared war.</i>

733
00:56:07,397 --> 00:56:09,565
<i>Many times</i>
<i>he'd take me into town,</i>

734
00:56:09,567 --> 00:56:12,434
<i>just so I could hold his coat.</i>

735
00:56:12,436 --> 00:56:14,403
- There.
<i>-  Where?</i>

736
00:56:14,405 --> 00:56:16,872
There, behind the green car.

737
00:56:19,008 --> 00:56:20,442
It's not big enough.

738
00:56:20,444 --> 00:56:22,444
<i>It is, there's plenty of space.</i>

739
00:56:22,446 --> 00:56:24,513
<i>I saw it.</i>

740
00:56:24,515 --> 00:56:25,981
It's not enough space.

741
00:56:25,983 --> 00:56:28,083
<i>I'm telling you</i>
<i>there's plenty of space.</i>

742
00:56:34,858 --> 00:56:36,024
No.

743
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:41,930
Can I try?

744
00:56:41,932 --> 00:56:44,767
<i>Can you try?</i>

745
00:56:44,769 --> 00:56:46,635
<i>I'm a wizard at this.</i>

746
00:56:46,637 --> 00:56:48,370
I just tried it.
There's not enough space, Joe.

747
00:56:48,372 --> 00:56:50,506
You just saw me do it.
There's not enough space.

748
00:56:50,508 --> 00:56:51,707
Okay?

749
00:56:51,709 --> 00:56:54,476
- Can I try?
- You wanna try?

750
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:58,647
Why not?

751
00:57:45,495 --> 00:57:47,696
<i>It was about this time</i>

752
00:57:47,698 --> 00:57:51,667
<i>that a dramatic change</i>
<i>happened inside of me.</i>

753
00:57:53,503 --> 00:57:55,471
<i>I could suddenly see</i>

754
00:57:55,473 --> 00:57:58,607
<i>a kind of order in the mess.</i>

755
00:57:58,609 --> 00:58:00,976
It was all very very wrong.

756
00:58:02,412 --> 00:58:04,980
I wanted to be
one of Jerome's things.

757
00:58:04,982 --> 00:58:07,850
I wanted to be picked up

758
00:58:07,852 --> 00:58:11,487
and put down again and again.

759
00:58:11,489 --> 00:58:13,922
<i>I wanted to be treated</i>
<i>by his hands,</i>

760
00:58:13,924 --> 00:58:17,459
according to some
sophisticated principle

761
00:58:17,461 --> 00:58:20,062
that I didn't understand.

762
00:58:20,064 --> 00:58:21,830
His strong hands?

763
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:23,732
Yes, but now it was

764
00:58:23,734 --> 00:58:25,767
no longer just about his hands.

765
00:58:25,769 --> 00:58:29,171
It was as if everything
about him was different,

766
00:58:29,173 --> 00:58:31,673
<i>which of course it wasn't,</i>

767
00:58:31,675 --> 00:58:33,208
<i>and I knew that in my head.</i>

768
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:35,477
And I scolded myself
for seeing him

769
00:58:35,479 --> 00:58:36,945
in this new light.

770
00:58:37,881 --> 00:58:39,815
Love is blind.

771
00:58:39,817 --> 00:58:41,950
No no no, it's worse.

772
00:58:42,919 --> 00:58:45,454
Love distorts things.

773
00:58:45,456 --> 00:58:48,457
Or even worse,
love is something

774
00:58:48,459 --> 00:58:50,526
you've never asked for.

775
00:58:51,728 --> 00:58:53,562
The erotic was
something I asked for

776
00:58:53,564 --> 00:58:55,831
or even demanded of men.

777
00:58:55,833 --> 00:58:58,600
But this idiotic love...

778
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:02,538
I felt humiliated by it...

779
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:06,174
And all the dishonesty
that follows.

780
00:59:08,578 --> 00:59:10,979
The erotic is about saying yes.

781
00:59:12,815 --> 00:59:15,717
Love appeals
to the lowest instincts,

782
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:18,053
wrapped up in lies.

783
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:19,755
How do you say yes

784
00:59:19,757 --> 00:59:22,758
when you mean no
and vice versa?

785
00:59:26,195 --> 00:59:29,064
I'm ashamed of what I became,

786
00:59:29,066 --> 00:59:31,700
but it was beyond my control.

787
00:59:33,836 --> 00:59:35,771
You know what you're doing now?

788
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:38,574
No, what am I doing?

789
00:59:38,576 --> 00:59:41,243
You're defending
your personality.

790
00:59:41,245 --> 00:59:44,246
I thought the point
was to reveal it.

791
00:59:50,653 --> 00:59:53,822
<i>At this time
I took up walking again.</i>

792
00:59:53,824 --> 00:59:55,657
<i>I walked in the forest.</i>

793
01:00:00,129 --> 01:00:02,631
<i>The forest of my childhood.</i>

794
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:07,669
<i>I took the same walk</i>
<i>again and again.</i>

795
01:00:08,905 --> 01:00:11,840
<i>Right turn after the gatehouse,</i>

796
01:00:11,842 --> 01:00:14,676
<i>and right again</i>
<i>by the ash tree,</i>

797
01:00:14,678 --> 01:00:17,379
<i>which has the most beautiful</i>
<i>leaves in the forest.</i>

798
01:00:19,048 --> 01:00:22,751
<i>And further on past</i>
<i>the lady with her poodle</i>

799
01:00:22,753 --> 01:00:25,253
<i>and the old man on the bench.</i>

800
01:00:32,261 --> 01:00:34,262
<i>I couldn't free myself</i>

801
01:00:34,264 --> 01:00:38,033
<i>of the image of Jerome</i>
<i>and his careless elegance.</i>

802
01:00:45,575 --> 01:00:48,577
<i>And during this time,</i>
<i>when I was with other men,</i>

803
01:00:48,579 --> 01:00:52,314
<i>I forbade them to touch</i>
<i>my body with their hands.</i>

804
01:00:55,319 --> 01:00:59,655
<i>And soon I stopped</i>
<i>having sex altogether.</i>

805
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:04,593
<i>I tried to meet him</i>
<i>all the time.</i>

806
01:01:04,595 --> 01:01:07,295
<i>I found out where he lived,</i>

807
01:01:07,297 --> 01:01:10,265
<i>but of course never dared</i>
<i>ring his doorbell.</i>

808
01:01:13,369 --> 01:01:15,771
<i>I worked for a long time</i>
<i>on a letter</i>

809
01:01:15,773 --> 01:01:19,107
<i>in which I told him</i>
<i>about my feelings for him.</i>

810
01:01:20,109 --> 01:01:21,710
<i>A month would pass</i>

811
01:01:21,712 --> 01:01:23,845
<i>before I had built up</i>
<i>enough courage</i>

812
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:26,048
<i>to deliver it.</i>

813
01:01:34,824 --> 01:01:39,027
I'm sorry.
Isn't this Jerome's office?

814
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:43,265
I'm happy to say
that this never has been

815
01:01:43,267 --> 01:01:45,767
and never will be
Jerome's office.

816
01:01:45,769 --> 01:01:50,372
But my nephew has been standing
in for me while I've been unwell.

817
01:01:50,374 --> 01:01:53,909
Was that a letter for him?

818
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:56,344
- Yes.
- <i> Give it to me</i>

819
01:01:56,346 --> 01:01:59,181
and I will make sure
he gets it.

820
01:02:03,152 --> 01:02:05,420
I can't promise
when that might be,

821
01:02:05,422 --> 01:02:08,256
as he's long gone.

822
01:02:08,258 --> 01:02:10,192
<i>How the young finance</i>

823
01:02:10,194 --> 01:02:12,928
their irrepressible
desire for travel

824
01:02:12,930 --> 01:02:14,796
is a mystery to me.

825
01:02:14,798 --> 01:02:16,698
So he's gone?

826
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:18,333
Deserted us, yes.

827
01:02:19,669 --> 01:02:22,003
Raving about
a trip around the world

828
01:02:22,005 --> 01:02:24,339
- and married and all.
- Married?

829
01:02:24,341 --> 01:02:26,174
<i>Married, yes.</i>

830
01:02:26,176 --> 01:02:29,444
<i>Flown the Coop</i>
<i>with my secretary.</i>

831
01:02:30,713 --> 01:02:31,980
Liz.

832
01:02:39,122 --> 01:02:41,123
And your job?

833
01:02:41,125 --> 01:02:44,826
It turned out that
Jerome's Uncle demanded

834
01:02:44,828 --> 01:02:47,195
a bit more knowledge
about the business, so...

835
01:02:47,197 --> 01:02:49,397
that was the end of love then?

836
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:54,369
Well, maybe it's not
quite as simple.

837
01:02:54,371 --> 01:02:58,707
<i>But more about that later,</i>

838
01:02:58,709 --> 01:03:00,709
as they say in the novels.

839
01:03:00,711 --> 01:03:04,079
And Jerome just disappeared?

840
01:03:04,081 --> 01:03:07,082
Yes, though I tried
to keep him,

841
01:03:07,084 --> 01:03:09,818
in my own way, mentally,

842
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:13,522
as I masturbated on the train
amongst other people.

843
01:03:15,491 --> 01:03:17,459
You masturbated on the train?

844
01:03:17,461 --> 01:03:19,494
- On the seat?
- Yes, of course.

845
01:03:25,067 --> 01:03:27,869
<i>I did a Jigsaw puzzle.</i>

846
01:03:27,871 --> 01:03:29,204
<i>A Jigsaw puzzle?</i>

847
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:36,745
<i>I found details
in the other passengers</i>

848
01:03:36,747 --> 01:03:39,314
<i>that reminded me of Jerome.</i>

849
01:04:19,555 --> 01:04:21,890
<i>But in the long run,</i>

850
01:04:21,892 --> 01:04:24,159
<i>I couldn't hold on</i>
<i>to the details of him,</i>

851
01:04:24,161 --> 01:04:26,194
<i>no matter how hard I tried.</i>

852
01:04:27,463 --> 01:04:29,231
Maybe that's
how it is with memory.

853
01:04:29,233 --> 01:04:32,467
You... you remember
silhouettes,

854
01:04:32,469 --> 01:04:34,502
the essentials.

855
01:04:34,504 --> 01:04:38,006
But that's not necessarily
a bad thing.

856
01:04:40,344 --> 01:04:42,577
<i>Of course, as
silhouettes in the winter,</i>

857
01:04:42,579 --> 01:04:46,381
- <i> the trees are difficult to tell apart.</i>
- See these buds?

858
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:48,583
<i>My father
wrestled courageously</i>

859
01:04:48,585 --> 01:04:51,219
<i>with his flora</i>
<i>and tree type guides.</i>

860
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:54,890
It's actually...

861
01:04:56,425 --> 01:05:00,595
The souls of the trees
we see in the winter.

862
01:05:00,597 --> 01:05:03,131
In the summer, everything
is green and idyllic,

863
01:05:03,133 --> 01:05:04,966
but in the winter,

864
01:05:04,968 --> 01:05:07,969
the branches and the trunks,
they all stand out.

865
01:05:07,971 --> 01:05:09,604
Just look at how crooked
they all are.

866
01:05:11,821 --> 01:05:13,541
<i>The branches have to carry</i>
<i>all of the leaves</i>

867
01:05:13,543 --> 01:05:15,043
<i>into the sunlight.</i>

868
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:19,147
<i>It's one long struggle</i>
<i>for survival.</i>

869
01:05:22,551 --> 01:05:24,419
<i>My father surprised me</i>

870
01:05:24,421 --> 01:05:28,290
<i>by calling the naked trunks</i>
<i>the souls of the trees.</i>

871
01:05:28,292 --> 01:05:31,059
<i>A poetic thought</i>
<i>that was rare for him,</i>

872
01:05:31,061 --> 01:05:33,161
<i>as by his own account</i>

873
01:05:33,163 --> 01:05:35,563
<i>he preferred</i>
<i>the empirical sciences.</i>

874
01:05:38,968 --> 01:05:41,136
<i>And after Jerome?</i>

875
01:05:41,138 --> 01:05:43,338
I reacted...

876
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,241
Well, let's just say,

877
01:05:46,243 --> 01:05:48,076
aggressively.

878
01:05:48,078 --> 01:05:49,945
How?

879
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:54,215
By intensifying
my hunt for men.

880
01:05:56,185 --> 01:05:58,153
<i>You know</i>
<i>these supermarket doors</i>

881
01:05:58,155 --> 01:06:01,623
<i>that open and close by way</i>
<i>of some kind of sensor?</i>

882
01:06:01,625 --> 01:06:04,659
<i>Now compare</i>
<i>these doors to my cunt</i>

883
01:06:04,661 --> 01:06:08,563
<i>and add an extraordinarily</i>
<i>sensitive sensor.</i>

884
01:06:10,533 --> 01:06:12,901
<i>My sensitive door opening</i>

885
01:06:12,903 --> 01:06:15,136
<i>gave me an opportunity</i>
<i>to develop</i>

886
01:06:15,138 --> 01:06:17,072
<i>my morphological studies</i>

887
01:06:17,074 --> 01:06:19,207
<i>from leaves to genitals.</i>

888
01:06:24,246 --> 01:06:26,514
<i>I embarked on a trip through</i>

889
01:06:26,516 --> 01:06:29,050
<i>what, in the lingo</i>
<i>of children's books,</i>

890
01:06:29,052 --> 01:06:33,154
<i>one might call the country</i>
<i>of the big black cocks...</i>

891
01:06:35,591 --> 01:06:38,126
<i>The country</i>
<i>of the small yellow cocks</i>

892
01:06:38,128 --> 01:06:40,228
<i>and so on.</i>

893
01:06:40,230 --> 01:06:42,297
<i>And most of all,</i>
<i>I battled my way</i>

894
01:06:42,299 --> 01:06:45,233
<i>through an untold number</i>
<i>of circumcised cocks.</i>

895
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:50,171
<i>By the way, did you know</i>
<i>that if you combine</i>

896
01:06:50,173 --> 01:06:52,674
<i>all the foreskin</i>
<i>cut off through history</i>

897
01:06:52,676 --> 01:06:55,677
<i>it would reach to Mars</i>
<i>and back again?</i>

898
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:17,699
<i>Mrs. h.</i>

899
01:07:32,982 --> 01:07:36,151
<i>By now I had built up a sizable
circle of men...</i>-

900
01:07:36,153 --> 01:07:38,486
<i>and was starting</i>
<i>to have trouble</i>

901
01:07:38,488 --> 01:07:41,756
- <i> remembering who was who.</i>
<i>- Hello, sweetheart. Want to meet?</i>

902
01:07:41,758 --> 01:07:43,691
<i> It's fisher.</i>

903
01:07:43,693 --> 01:07:46,761
<i>I'm lying here, thinking</i>
<i>of you and what you said.</i>

904
01:07:46,763 --> 01:07:48,763
<i>I'm not angry at all</i>
<i>if that's what you think.</i>

905
01:07:48,765 --> 01:07:51,433
<i> Hi, Joe, it's rob again.</i>

906
01:07:51,435 --> 01:07:53,368
<i>I had a really good time</i>
<i>seeing you.</i>

907
01:07:53,370 --> 01:07:55,437
<i> Give me... give me a call.</i>

908
01:07:55,439 --> 01:07:58,573
<i>Hi, Joe, I left
a couple of messages.</i>

909
01:07:58,575 --> 01:08:01,142
- <i> Is everything all right?</i>
<i>- I quickly gave up</i>

910
01:08:01,144 --> 01:08:04,279
<i>trying to remember</i>
<i>the individual relationships.</i>

911
01:08:04,281 --> 01:08:06,714
<i>It was impossible,</i>

912
01:08:06,716 --> 01:08:10,151
<i>and impossible to predict</i>
<i>what they wanted to hear.</i>

913
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:13,588
<i>So I invented a method.</i>

914
01:08:17,026 --> 01:08:19,294
<i>It was all based on chance.</i>

915
01:08:22,466 --> 01:08:25,834
<i>A one meant</i>
<i>an overly loving answer.</i>

916
01:08:29,071 --> 01:08:32,807
<i>A two, not quite as passionate
but still positive.</i>

917
01:08:32,809 --> 01:08:34,609
<i>And so on up to five,</i>

918
01:08:34,611 --> 01:08:36,478
<i>which was a complete rejection.</i>

919
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:39,147
<i>And six, no answer at all.</i>

920
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:50,191
Hey, Eddie, it's me.

921
01:08:50,193 --> 01:08:52,193
Listen, I've given it
a lot of thought

922
01:08:52,195 --> 01:08:55,096
and I've come to the
conclusion that we're done.

923
01:08:55,098 --> 01:08:56,664
Bye.

924
01:08:56,666 --> 01:08:58,333
<i>The trick with this method</i>

925
01:08:58,335 --> 01:09:00,168
<i>was that I didn't have to worry</i>

926
01:09:00,170 --> 01:09:02,070
<i>about the individual</i>
<i>relationships...</i>

927
01:09:02,072 --> 01:09:04,572
Hi, Patrick, it's Joe.

928
01:09:04,574 --> 01:09:07,242
<i>But instead became</i>
<i>completely unpredictable,</i>

929
01:09:07,244 --> 01:09:10,345
<i>which of course</i>
<i>drove the men even Wilder.</i>

930
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:13,314
You're quite annoying,

931
01:09:13,316 --> 01:09:16,184
so I don't want
to see you anymore.

932
01:09:16,186 --> 01:09:17,752
Please don't call back.

933
01:09:17,754 --> 01:09:20,688
<i>That sounds rather stressful.</i>

934
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:22,824
<i>Yes, actually it was.</i>

935
01:09:22,826 --> 01:09:26,528
<i>But fortunately I had my
little book of comfort.</i>

936
01:09:28,531 --> 01:09:31,132
<i>When I needed comfort or peace,</i>

937
01:09:31,134 --> 01:09:33,468
<i>I took out my herbarium</i>

938
01:09:33,470 --> 01:09:36,271
<i>and looked</i>
<i>at my favorite leaves...</i>

939
01:09:36,273 --> 01:09:40,808
<i>ash, trembling Aspen and lime.</i>

940
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:52,153
<i>When you're dealing with a larger
group of lovers, as I was,</i>

941
01:09:52,155 --> 01:09:54,289
<i>there will typically</i>
<i>be a difference</i>

942
01:09:54,291 --> 01:09:55,857
<i>in their qualities.</i>

943
01:09:55,859 --> 01:09:58,426
<i>H was a sticky bastard.</i>

944
01:10:00,362 --> 01:10:02,597
You have to leave.
I've got guests for dinner.

945
01:10:02,599 --> 01:10:04,465
But he's not coming until 7:00.

946
01:10:05,434 --> 01:10:07,135
No.

947
01:10:07,137 --> 01:10:08,770
But 7:00 isn't that far away.

948
01:10:16,579 --> 01:10:18,379
Do you love me?

949
01:10:21,417 --> 01:10:24,252
<i><i>A was to arrive at 7:00,</i>

950
01:10:24,254 --> 01:10:26,487
<i>and I needed</i>
<i>to get h out of there.</i>

951
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:31,259
I love you too much.

952
01:10:32,695 --> 01:10:35,563
You keep promising,
but I understand now

953
01:10:35,565 --> 01:10:39,601
that you'll never leave
your family for my sake.

954
01:10:41,403 --> 01:10:43,238
It's sad, but...

955
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:46,507
It's your choice.

956
01:10:47,810 --> 01:10:49,477
<i>It's not satisfying for me</i>

957
01:10:49,479 --> 01:10:52,347
that I can't
have you completely.

958
01:10:54,817 --> 01:10:57,986
Which is why we can't see
each other any longer.

959
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:03,825
Goodbye.

960
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:09,697
Look, I...

961
01:11:14,203 --> 01:11:16,371
and have a nice life.

962
01:11:17,673 --> 01:11:19,474
Oh. Ugh. Wow.

963
01:11:41,864 --> 01:11:44,799
My darling, I'm yours.

964
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:47,735
I've left her.

965
01:11:55,544 --> 01:11:58,046
- <i> Has he gone inside?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

966
01:11:59,848 --> 01:12:01,649
<i>Is the door closed?</i>

967
01:12:13,962 --> 01:12:16,264
- <i> Uh, hello.</i>
- Hello.

968
01:12:16,266 --> 01:12:17,365
<i>Apologize.</i>

969
01:12:17,367 --> 01:12:21,569
We... had promised
not to come up.

970
01:12:22,971 --> 01:12:25,673
<i>We just wanted to make sure</i>

971
01:12:25,675 --> 01:12:29,777
he got here safely, now that
he's made the big decision.

972
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:34,749
<i>May the children</i>
<i>see him inside?</i>

973
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:52,800
What a nice place.

974
01:12:54,403 --> 01:12:57,538
It's... so bohemian.

975
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:03,745
Oh, that's right.

976
01:13:03,747 --> 01:13:06,547
- You need the car key.
- Uh, no, I don't need the car.

977
01:13:06,549 --> 01:13:08,316
Oh yes, you do.

978
01:13:08,318 --> 01:13:10,351
He likes the car.

979
01:13:10,353 --> 01:13:11,686
Here.

980
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:15,390
- No, please. Just take it.
- I don't want it.

981
01:13:15,392 --> 01:13:17,233
- Just take it.
- I don't want the fucking car!

982
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:22,864
<i>It's all right.</i>

983
01:13:22,866 --> 01:13:25,400
We'll get the bus home.

984
01:13:25,402 --> 01:13:29,370
The children might as well get used
to public transport now, right?

985
01:13:29,372 --> 01:13:32,673
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>their standard of living</i>

986
01:13:32,675 --> 01:13:34,142
<i>won't be the same</i>
<i>anymore, but...</i>

987
01:13:38,647 --> 01:13:43,050
Hey. What's this?

988
01:13:43,052 --> 01:13:45,686
It's a present.

989
01:13:45,688 --> 01:13:49,123
A pillow he has
embroidered himself.

990
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:52,727
<i>- And who's it for?</i>
- Daddy.

991
01:13:54,997 --> 01:13:57,465
I do hope it's all right
if the children call

992
01:13:57,467 --> 01:13:58,800
their father "daddy" here.

993
01:13:58,802 --> 01:13:59,901
If you prefer,

994
01:13:59,903 --> 01:14:03,438
they can call him "him"

995
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:06,707
or simply "the man."

996
01:14:06,709 --> 01:14:09,444
To be honest, my first
thought was never ever

997
01:14:09,446 --> 01:14:11,379
to let either of you
see the children,

998
01:14:11,381 --> 01:14:13,481
but then I changed my mind.

999
01:14:13,483 --> 01:14:16,384
I thought it only right that
their father be confronted

1000
01:14:16,386 --> 01:14:18,886
by the little people
whose lives he has destroyed.

1001
01:14:19,922 --> 01:14:22,523
Give daddy your present.

1002
01:14:26,395 --> 01:14:29,597
<i>It's a car the little dear</i>
<i>has embroidered.</i>

1003
01:14:29,599 --> 01:14:33,000
I'm aware
that not everyone can see it,

1004
01:14:33,002 --> 01:14:36,537
but with the heart
one can see much,

1005
01:14:36,539 --> 01:14:39,941
however unimportant that
information may be to you.

1006
01:14:42,411 --> 01:14:43,611
Would it be all right

1007
01:14:43,613 --> 01:14:46,581
if I showed the children
the whoring bed?

1008
01:14:46,583 --> 01:14:50,852
After all, they also have
a stake in this event.

1009
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:57,158
<i>You need to see it, right?</i>

1010
01:14:57,160 --> 01:15:00,161
<i>Let's go see
daddy's favorite place.</i>

1011
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:03,197
Come on, boys.

1012
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:06,501
Oh...!

1013
01:15:09,873 --> 01:15:13,107
So this is
where it all happened.

1014
01:15:19,114 --> 01:15:22,450
You should try
to memorize this room,

1015
01:15:22,452 --> 01:15:24,652
especially the bed.

1016
01:15:24,654 --> 01:15:28,523
It'll stand you in good
stead later in therapy.

1017
01:15:30,093 --> 01:15:32,760
<i>Here I sit,</i>
<i>rambling on about therapy</i>

1018
01:15:32,762 --> 01:15:34,962
<i>without a thought</i>
<i>of what it might cost.</i>

1019
01:15:34,964 --> 01:15:37,732
I do hope you don't think
we're here to beg.

1020
01:15:41,103 --> 01:15:44,238
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1021
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:46,607
I'm being silly.

1022
01:15:46,609 --> 01:15:48,009
Mommy's being silly.

1023
01:15:48,944 --> 01:15:51,679
Let's have a cup of tea.

1024
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:10,197
The children's father likes

1025
01:16:10,199 --> 01:16:12,300
two lumps of sugar in his tea.

1026
01:16:28,817 --> 01:16:31,953
<i> Mmm!</i>

1027
01:16:31,955 --> 01:16:33,688
- I'll get it.
<i> Hm-mmm.</i>

1028
01:16:33,690 --> 01:16:35,410
- No no no, please please please.
- <i> Hm-mmm.</i>

1029
01:16:37,225 --> 01:16:38,960
- Hello.
- Hello.

1030
01:16:39,895 --> 01:16:41,796
- Yes?
- Uh...

1031
01:16:41,798 --> 01:16:44,065
Oh, how nice! Lovely.

1032
01:16:44,067 --> 01:16:47,201
- Boys. Come here.
- Is Joe here?

1033
01:16:47,203 --> 01:16:49,070
This might be interesting.

1034
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:52,940
- Hi. Yes.
- This is my son. Yes.

1035
01:16:52,942 --> 01:16:55,543
- Hello hello.
- Good boy. Look him in the eyes.

1036
01:16:55,545 --> 01:16:56,811
<i>I'm Andy. Hello.</i>

1037
01:16:56,813 --> 01:16:58,279
Friend of Joe's then?

1038
01:16:58,281 --> 01:16:59,981
- Yeah.
- You known each other long?

1039
01:16:59,983 --> 01:17:03,551
- Um, not that long, no.
- Not terribly long?

1040
01:17:03,553 --> 01:17:04,819
- No.
- Oh.

1041
01:17:13,028 --> 01:17:15,663
<i>A menage a trois.</i>

1042
01:17:17,099 --> 01:17:19,233
It's all so exotic.

1043
01:17:19,235 --> 01:17:22,336
So... broad-minded.

1044
01:17:24,039 --> 01:17:25,773
On that point...

1045
01:17:26,808 --> 01:17:28,576
I failed.

1046
01:17:28,578 --> 01:17:30,411
No doubt about it.

1047
01:17:32,581 --> 01:17:36,317
Boys, now is
the time to be alert

1048
01:17:36,319 --> 01:17:40,755
and ask all the questions
your hearts' desire,

1049
01:17:41,723 --> 01:17:42,890
because...

1050
01:17:44,192 --> 01:17:47,695
I hope that you shall
never have to encounter

1051
01:17:47,697 --> 01:17:50,965
such people or be in such
a situation ever again.

1052
01:17:52,134 --> 01:17:54,101
<i>Well? Hmm?</i>

1053
01:17:54,103 --> 01:17:55,970
<i>You don't have any questions?</i>

1054
01:17:57,005 --> 01:17:59,006
No?

1055
01:18:01,076 --> 01:18:02,443
Well, I'll start, shall I?

1056
01:18:04,046 --> 01:18:06,380
Approximately how many lives

1057
01:18:06,382 --> 01:18:09,684
<i>do you think she has time</i>
<i>to destroy in one day?</i>

1058
01:18:09,686 --> 01:18:11,719
<i> Five?</i>

1059
01:18:11,721 --> 01:18:13,120
<i>50?</i>

1060
01:18:14,189 --> 01:18:15,823
<i>Or several hundreds?</i>

1061
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:22,463
Look, this is just
a big misunderstanding.

1062
01:18:27,636 --> 01:18:28,969
Boys...

1063
01:18:31,073 --> 01:18:34,975
I don't... I don't love your father.

1064
01:18:34,977 --> 01:18:37,311
<i>She's just saying
that to make us feel better.</i>

1065
01:18:37,313 --> 01:18:40,715
I'm sure you understand that.

1066
01:18:40,717 --> 01:18:42,383
Because if it were
a joke, I mean...

1067
01:18:43,418 --> 01:18:46,320
If... this were really a joke,

1068
01:18:46,322 --> 01:18:48,489
then it would be
a joke so cruel.

1069
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:57,298
No one can be that cruel.

1070
01:18:58,767 --> 01:19:01,435
To destroy a mesh
of feelings woven

1071
01:19:01,437 --> 01:19:05,940
over 20 years is no joke,
I can assure you.

1072
01:19:15,684 --> 01:19:18,319
Well...

1073
01:19:18,321 --> 01:19:21,689
If three's a crowd,
then seven must be a bit

1074
01:19:21,691 --> 01:19:23,324
of a challenge
for the pretty miss.

1075
01:19:26,228 --> 01:19:28,229
<i>I must say I have a hard time</i>

1076
01:19:28,231 --> 01:19:30,798
<i>picturing her</i>
<i>enjoying loneliness.</i>

1077
01:19:32,868 --> 01:19:36,137
I think we'd better grab
the chance to get away,

1078
01:19:36,139 --> 01:19:39,373
before things become grotesque.

1079
01:19:39,375 --> 01:19:41,075
Come on.

1080
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:45,446
- No, dad!
- No. No. No.

1081
01:19:45,448 --> 01:19:47,948
Come on.

1082
01:19:47,950 --> 01:19:51,185
You wouldn't want to give your father
a guilty conscience now, would you?

1083
01:20:10,305 --> 01:20:12,573
So how did this episode
affect your life?

1084
01:20:14,009 --> 01:20:15,509
Not at all.

1085
01:20:17,312 --> 01:20:20,047
- Not at all?
- No.

1086
01:20:21,449 --> 01:20:24,351
You can't make an omelet
without breaking a few eggs.

1087
01:20:28,790 --> 01:20:30,558
Oh, that's true.

1088
01:20:33,862 --> 01:20:35,129
Some people...

1089
01:20:36,131 --> 01:20:37,464
Blame the addict.

1090
01:20:37,466 --> 01:20:41,268
<i>Other people feel sorry</i>
<i>for the addict.</i>

1091
01:20:41,270 --> 01:20:45,472
But I was an addict out
of lust, not out of need.

1092
01:20:47,109 --> 01:20:48,909
You would say that,
wouldn't you?

1093
01:20:48,911 --> 01:20:52,913
And lust that led
to destruction around me...

1094
01:20:52,915 --> 01:20:54,882
Everywhere I went.

1095
01:20:56,451 --> 01:21:00,855
<i>Well, addiction</i>
<i>sometimes leads to an...</i>

1096
01:21:00,857 --> 01:21:02,356
<i>Absence of empathy.</i>

1097
01:21:04,926 --> 01:21:06,961
You can't fight a lion
and blow the noses

1098
01:21:06,963 --> 01:21:09,063
of your children
at the same time.

1099
01:21:11,066 --> 01:21:14,134
For me, nymphomania
was callousness.

1100
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:20,107
<i>You're very stubborn.</i>

1101
01:21:20,109 --> 01:21:22,243
<i>But what about yourself?</i>

1102
01:21:22,245 --> 01:21:25,346
<i>How did you feel</i>
<i>during all this?</i>

1103
01:21:35,557 --> 01:21:37,291
Did you feel good

1104
01:21:37,293 --> 01:21:39,093
or did you feel bad?

1105
01:21:46,334 --> 01:21:49,503
Mrs. h was right
about the loneliness.

1106
01:21:50,438 --> 01:21:52,006
I'd be lying if I said

1107
01:21:52,008 --> 01:21:53,707
it hadn't been
my constant companion.

1108
01:21:57,312 --> 01:21:59,280
<i>So you were with all these men</i>

1109
01:21:59,282 --> 01:22:01,682
<i>and you still felt alone?</i>

1110
01:22:08,323 --> 01:22:10,958
I didn't want
to tell you about it...

1111
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:14,695
<i>But you've led me into a trap.</i>

1112
01:22:18,233 --> 01:22:20,601
It was a certain feeling.

1113
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:29,944
Oh, how awful that everything
has to be so trivial.

1114
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:42,356
<i>When I was seven,</i>
<i>I had to have an operation.</i>

1115
01:22:42,358 --> 01:22:46,593
<i>Nothing serious,</i>
<i>but it did require anesthesia.</i>

1116
01:22:48,096 --> 01:22:50,531
<i>I had already been</i>
<i>pre-medicated</i>

1117
01:22:50,533 --> 01:22:53,267
<i>and was feeling all right.</i>

1118
01:22:53,269 --> 01:22:57,071
<i>But when I looked into the room
where the doctors and nurses</i>

1119
01:22:57,073 --> 01:22:58,739
<i>were preparing</i>
<i>for the operation...</i>

1120
01:23:00,208 --> 01:23:02,643
<i>It was as if I had</i>
<i>to pass through</i>

1121
01:23:02,645 --> 01:23:06,680
<i>an impenetrable gate</i>
<i>all by myself.</i>

1122
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:11,485
<i>It wasn't just that</i>
<i>I missed my mom.</i>

1123
01:23:11,487 --> 01:23:13,921
<i>I don't think I missed my dad,</i>

1124
01:23:13,923 --> 01:23:15,689
<i>even though</i>
<i>he was the nice one.</i>

1125
01:23:17,192 --> 01:23:19,526
<i>It was as if I was</i>
<i>completely alone</i>

1126
01:23:19,528 --> 01:23:21,095
<i>in the universe.</i>

1127
01:23:23,565 --> 01:23:28,002
<i>As if my whole body was filled</i>
<i>with loneliness and tears.</i>

1128
01:23:51,559 --> 01:23:54,661
And I'm still not allowed
to feel sorry for you?

1129
01:23:56,731 --> 01:23:58,665
Shall we go on?

1130
01:24:05,607 --> 01:24:07,708
<i>What are you reading?</i>

1131
01:24:07,710 --> 01:24:10,544
I'm not reading really.
I'm just

1132
01:24:10,546 --> 01:24:13,447
reacquainting myself
with Edgar Allan poe.

1133
01:24:14,382 --> 01:24:15,716
I don't know him.

1134
01:24:15,718 --> 01:24:18,685
No. Well, he was a...

1135
01:24:20,655 --> 01:24:23,057
A very anxiety-ridden man.

1136
01:24:29,030 --> 01:24:32,666
He died in the most fearful
way you can imagine,

1137
01:24:32,668 --> 01:24:36,070
in something called
delirium tremens.

1138
01:24:38,173 --> 01:24:41,542
It occurs when a long time
abuse of alcohol

1139
01:24:41,544 --> 01:24:45,245
is followed by...
By a sudden abstinence.

1140
01:24:47,282 --> 01:24:50,717
And your body goes into some
kind of a hypersensitive shock.

1141
01:24:52,287 --> 01:24:55,355
You can see the most
horrifying hallucinations

1142
01:24:55,357 --> 01:24:59,193
<i>like rats and snakes</i>
<i>and cockroaches</i>

1143
01:24:59,195 --> 01:25:03,530
<i>coming out of the floor and
worms slithering in the walls.</i>

1144
01:25:06,634 --> 01:25:09,570
<i>One's entire nervous system</i>
<i>is on high alert</i>

1145
01:25:09,572 --> 01:25:13,140
and you have a constant
panic and paranoia.

1146
01:25:14,776 --> 01:25:17,611
And then
the circulatory system fails.

1147
01:25:18,546 --> 01:25:20,214
But the panic and horror...

1148
01:25:21,382 --> 01:25:24,118
Remains until
the moment of death.

1149
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:42,569
I know what delirium is.

1150
01:25:46,541 --> 01:25:49,843
<i>"During the whole
of a dull, dark, and soundless day</i>

1151
01:25:49,845 --> 01:25:52,079
<i>in the autumn of the year,</i>

1152
01:25:52,081 --> 01:25:55,282
<i>when the clouds hung
oppressively low in the heavens,</i>

1153
01:25:55,284 --> 01:25:59,286
<i>I had been passing alone,</i>
<i>on horseback,</i>

1154
01:25:59,288 --> 01:26:02,089
<i>through a singularly dreary</i>
<i>tract of country,</i>

1155
01:26:02,091 --> 01:26:04,725
<i>and at length found myself,</i>

1156
01:26:04,727 --> 01:26:07,327
<i>as the shades</i>
<i>of the evening drew on,</i>

1157
01:26:07,329 --> 01:26:11,265
<i>"within view of the
melancholy house of Usher."</i>

1158
01:26:41,363 --> 01:26:43,630
Hey, dad.

1159
01:26:52,507 --> 01:26:56,276
Hey, luv.

1160
01:26:58,613 --> 01:27:00,347
<i>How are you?</i>

1161
01:27:01,583 --> 01:27:03,150
I fought with mom.

1162
01:27:05,321 --> 01:27:07,554
She's... she's not coming.

1163
01:27:11,826 --> 01:27:14,795
You ought not
to fight with her.

1164
01:27:14,797 --> 01:27:17,297
You know kay's fear
of hospitals.

1165
01:27:20,635 --> 01:27:22,736
<i>I know she's not coming.</i>

1166
01:27:22,738 --> 01:27:25,706
We already said everything
we needed to say.

1167
01:27:28,476 --> 01:27:30,577
<i>Kay and I said goodbye at home.</i>

1168
01:27:32,247 --> 01:27:33,880
I don't want her here at all.

1169
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:39,219
I can't accept that.

1170
01:27:39,221 --> 01:27:42,522
You'll have to.

1171
01:27:42,524 --> 01:27:45,459
She's a cowardly stupid bitch.

1172
01:27:46,861 --> 01:27:49,196
No, she's not.

1173
01:27:49,198 --> 01:27:52,966
- Yes. Yes.
- No, she's not. No, she's not.

1174
01:27:52,968 --> 01:27:55,469
Yes, she is, and you've
never understood that.

1175
01:28:05,847 --> 01:28:09,316
Mmm.

1176
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:12,519
Doesn't it scare you?

1177
01:28:12,521 --> 01:28:15,522
No.

1178
01:28:18,660 --> 01:28:19,993
No.

1179
01:28:23,431 --> 01:28:25,565
How can you not be afraid?

1180
01:28:30,238 --> 01:28:32,506
I've seen so many die.

1181
01:28:34,909 --> 01:28:36,943
Then there's that...

1182
01:28:36,945 --> 01:28:39,880
Epicurus quote about
not fearing death.

1183
01:28:41,382 --> 01:28:44,084
"When we are,
death has not come."

1184
01:28:45,453 --> 01:28:47,387
When death has come...

1185
01:28:48,356 --> 01:28:49,623
"We are not."

1186
01:28:53,728 --> 01:28:56,430
We know what's going to happen.

1187
01:28:56,432 --> 01:28:59,499
I also know all of the drugs
the doctors have to offer.

1188
01:28:59,501 --> 01:29:01,702
So no...

1189
01:29:02,804 --> 01:29:03,970
I am not...

1190
01:29:03,972 --> 01:29:06,473
I am not afraid.

1191
01:29:07,975 --> 01:29:11,678
Hmm. A beautiful girl.

1192
01:29:13,281 --> 01:29:15,782
Beautiful dad.

1193
01:29:37,705 --> 01:29:39,473
K-kay!

1194
01:29:39,475 --> 01:29:42,709
Daddy, it's okay.

1195
01:29:42,711 --> 01:29:43,944
Kay?

1196
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:52,986
Daddy.

1197
01:29:57,825 --> 01:29:59,726
Hey.

1198
01:30:03,364 --> 01:30:04,898
It's gonna be okay.

1199
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:27,020
Don't you want
to take a little walk?

1200
01:30:27,022 --> 01:30:30,490
I'll stay with your father
in the meantime.

1201
01:30:30,492 --> 01:30:32,359
You'll stay?

1202
01:30:32,361 --> 01:30:34,795
- You'll stay here?
- Yes.

1203
01:31:17,605 --> 01:31:19,706
Ash tree leaves.

1204
01:31:22,009 --> 01:31:24,544
<i>Where did you find them?</i>

1205
01:31:24,546 --> 01:31:26,480
They were in the park.

1206
01:31:34,155 --> 01:31:37,557
It truly is the most beautiful
tree in the forest.

1207
01:31:41,596 --> 01:31:42,829
But, dad...

1208
01:31:44,165 --> 01:31:46,700
How do you
recognize it in winter?

1209
01:31:47,869 --> 01:31:49,769
<i>I've told you a hundred times.</i>

1210
01:31:51,572 --> 01:31:53,540
But I can't remember.

1211
01:31:58,212 --> 01:31:59,946
<i>When the ash tree</i>
<i>was created...</i>

1212
01:32:03,918 --> 01:32:06,887
It made all the other trees
in the forest jealous...

1213
01:32:08,022 --> 01:32:10,056
'Cause it was...

1214
01:32:11,859 --> 01:32:14,794
It was the most beautiful
tree in the forest.

1215
01:32:17,865 --> 01:32:19,766
It had the strongest wood.

1216
01:32:21,068 --> 01:32:25,739
It was the world tree
in norse mythology.

1217
01:32:27,108 --> 01:32:30,010
<i>You couldn't say</i>
<i>anything bad about it.</i>

1218
01:32:34,115 --> 01:32:36,683
<i>And when all the other trees...</i>

1219
01:32:36,685 --> 01:32:39,686
<i>Saw the ash tree with its...</i>

1220
01:32:39,688 --> 01:32:41,555
<i>Black buds...</i>

1221
01:32:42,590 --> 01:32:44,958
They all started laughing.

1222
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:47,060
"Oh, look..."

1223
01:32:48,629 --> 01:32:51,998
"The ash tree's had
its fingers in the ashes."

1224
01:33:08,983 --> 01:33:12,185
Dad. Daddy!

1225
01:33:12,187 --> 01:33:15,855
Daddy. Daddy, what's wrong?
Daddy, what's wrong?

1226
01:33:15,857 --> 01:33:17,857
What's wrong?

1227
01:33:17,859 --> 01:33:19,859
Daddy, it's me!

1228
01:33:19,861 --> 01:33:21,828
It's me, daddy. It's me!

1229
01:33:22,797 --> 01:33:25,632
Help! Help!

1230
01:33:25,634 --> 01:33:28,535
- <i> Daddy, it's okay.</i>
- Okay.

1231
01:33:28,537 --> 01:33:30,537
Okay.

1232
01:33:30,539 --> 01:33:33,707
It's okay.

1233
01:33:33,709 --> 01:33:36,876
It's okay. It's all right.

1234
01:33:40,015 --> 01:33:41,247
<i>It's all right.</i>

1235
01:33:52,326 --> 01:33:54,594
<i>- We have to fixate him.</i>

1236
01:33:54,596 --> 01:33:56,096
What are you doing?

1237
01:33:56,098 --> 01:33:58,031
<i>What are you doing to me?</i>

1238
01:34:03,004 --> 01:34:06,239
Joe! What are you doing to me?

1239
01:34:16,083 --> 01:34:19,986
<i> Joe! Help! Joe!</i>

1240
01:34:28,229 --> 01:34:30,196
You should take a break.

1241
01:34:31,766 --> 01:34:33,133
Okay.

1242
01:35:34,261 --> 01:35:35,829
<i>Excuse me.</i>

1243
01:35:35,831 --> 01:35:39,332
<i>Can you help me</i>
<i>to clean... um...</i>

1244
01:35:40,434 --> 01:35:41,835
Oh.

1245
01:35:42,970 --> 01:35:44,704
Okay, mister... Don't worry.

1246
01:35:44,706 --> 01:35:47,373
Just... I need some help.

1247
01:36:21,175 --> 01:36:23,777
<i>We're going to have
to change the sheets.</i>

1248
01:36:33,954 --> 01:36:35,488
Ready?

1249
01:37:38,886 --> 01:37:40,787
<i>When he died,</i>

1250
01:37:40,789 --> 01:37:44,157
<i>I had no feelings left.</i>

1251
01:37:44,159 --> 01:37:46,826
<i>Well, that's
certainly understandable.</i>

1252
01:37:46,828 --> 01:37:48,461
<i> No.</i>

1253
01:37:48,463 --> 01:37:50,430
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>what happened to me.</i>

1254
01:37:51,799 --> 01:37:54,000
<i>It was very shameful.</i>

1255
01:37:54,002 --> 01:37:56,336
<i>Shameful?</i>

1256
01:37:56,338 --> 01:37:58,538
<i>I don't understand.</i>

1257
01:38:24,198 --> 01:38:26,366
<i>I lubricated.</i>

1258
01:38:41,348 --> 01:38:43,883
I know you like
to present yourself

1259
01:38:43,885 --> 01:38:47,353
in a negative way and that you
have this kind of dark bias

1260
01:38:47,355 --> 01:38:49,489
that you're worse
than everyone else.

1261
01:38:49,491 --> 01:38:52,191
But this story doesn't add
to that belief.

1262
01:38:54,194 --> 01:38:57,864
It's extremely common to
react sexually in a crisis.

1263
01:38:57,866 --> 01:38:59,999
It may be shameful to you,

1264
01:39:00,001 --> 01:39:04,370
but in literature
there's many worse examples.

1265
01:39:33,133 --> 01:39:35,201
You listen to music, I see?

1266
01:39:35,203 --> 01:39:38,404
Yes. I like it a lot.

1267
01:39:39,373 --> 01:39:41,007
Shall I find a tape?

1268
01:39:41,009 --> 01:39:43,676
No, if there's a tape
already in the machine,

1269
01:39:43,678 --> 01:39:47,680
I'd like to hear that. -<i>It's something
I've been listening to a lot lately,</i>

1270
01:39:47,682 --> 01:39:52,151
<i>though it's not an entirely
complete recording, unfortunately.</i>

1271
01:39:52,153 --> 01:39:54,654
- What is it?
- It's bach,

1272
01:39:54,656 --> 01:39:57,323
from his little organ book.

1273
01:39:58,625 --> 01:40:01,627
<i>"Ich ruf zu dir,</i>
<i>herr jesu Christ."</i>

1274
01:40:04,031 --> 01:40:06,566
The theme is originally a hymn,

1275
01:40:06,568 --> 01:40:11,237
but bach rearranged it
and embellished it a little.

1276
01:40:11,239 --> 01:40:15,274
He was the master of polyphony,
if you know what that is.

1277
01:40:15,276 --> 01:40:17,577
No. Yet another thing
I don't know.

1278
01:40:17,579 --> 01:40:19,412
<i>Well, polyphony is</i>

1279
01:40:19,414 --> 01:40:21,180
<i>from the middle ages.</i>

1280
01:40:21,182 --> 01:40:23,716
It's an entirely
European phenomenon.

1281
01:40:23,718 --> 01:40:25,685
It's distinguished by...

1282
01:40:25,687 --> 01:40:28,588
by the idea that every voice

1283
01:40:28,590 --> 01:40:31,257
<i>is its own melody</i>

1284
01:40:31,259 --> 01:40:34,160
but together in harmony.

1285
01:40:35,562 --> 01:40:38,197
Bach's forerunner palestrina,

1286
01:40:38,199 --> 01:40:41,234
he wrote many works
for several choirs

1287
01:40:41,236 --> 01:40:45,171
at the same time, wallowing in
polyphony. -

1288
01:40:54,615 --> 01:40:57,417
But in my eyes, bach perfected

1289
01:40:57,419 --> 01:41:00,620
the melodic expression
and the harmony.

1290
01:41:00,622 --> 01:41:03,256
And also...
also mixed up with some...

1291
01:41:03,258 --> 01:41:07,560
Rather incomprehensible mystique
regarding numbers,

1292
01:41:07,562 --> 01:41:11,397
<i>most likely based</i>
<i>on the fibonacci sequence.</i>

1293
01:41:13,033 --> 01:41:15,168
You know, the one that
starts with a zero,

1294
01:41:15,170 --> 01:41:17,303
then comes the one.

1295
01:41:17,305 --> 01:41:21,441
The sequence is created by
adding the two previous numbers

1296
01:41:21,443 --> 01:41:24,744
to create the new one, so
it's zero plus one makes one,

1297
01:41:24,746 --> 01:41:27,513
and one plus one makes two,
and two plus one makes three,

1298
01:41:27,515 --> 01:41:30,650
and three plus two makes five,
and five plus three makes eight,

1299
01:41:30,652 --> 01:41:33,019
and eight plus five makes 13.

1300
01:41:33,021 --> 01:41:35,021
The sequence has
an interesting connection

1301
01:41:35,023 --> 01:41:37,590
<i>to Pythagoras' theorem</i>
<i>and the golden section.</i>

1302
01:41:39,259 --> 01:41:43,029
<i>It was all about finding</i>
<i>a divine methodology</i>

1303
01:41:43,031 --> 01:41:44,430
<i>in art and architecture.</i>

1304
01:41:44,432 --> 01:41:46,499
<i>A bit like the way a tritone...</i>

1305
01:41:46,501 --> 01:41:49,068
<i>which was played on the
piano in your little club...</i>

1306
01:41:49,070 --> 01:41:52,371
<i> was supposed to be a satanic interval.</i>

1307
01:41:52,373 --> 01:41:55,675
<i>The sum of the numeric values</i>
<i>represented in bach's name</i>

1308
01:41:55,677 --> 01:41:59,645
<i>is 14, a number he often
used in his compositions.</i>

1309
01:41:59,647 --> 01:42:01,781
<i>The clever thing</i>
<i>about bach's name</i>

1310
01:42:01,783 --> 01:42:05,051
is that the numeric value
of the individual letters

1311
01:42:05,053 --> 01:42:07,386
are all fibonacci numbers.

1312
01:42:10,290 --> 01:42:12,592
This piece has three voices:

1313
01:42:12,594 --> 01:42:14,127
A bass voice...

1314
01:42:19,766 --> 01:42:21,801
The second voice played
with the left hand...

1315
01:42:26,540 --> 01:42:29,108
The first voice played
with the right hand.

1316
01:42:29,110 --> 01:42:32,378
<i>That is called</i> cantus firmus
<i>or "can-toos feer-mus."</i>

1317
01:42:32,380 --> 01:42:35,982
And together, these three
voices create the polyphony.

1318
01:42:39,653 --> 01:42:43,489
Normally, a nymphomaniac
is seen as

1319
01:42:43,491 --> 01:42:46,526
someone who can't get enough

1320
01:42:46,528 --> 01:42:49,462
and therefore has sex
with many different people.

1321
01:42:49,464 --> 01:42:51,197
<i>Well, that of course is true,</i>

1322
01:42:51,199 --> 01:42:53,366
<i>but if I'm to be honest,</i>

1323
01:42:53,368 --> 01:42:55,835
<i>I see it precisely as...</i>

1324
01:42:55,837 --> 01:43:00,806
The sum of all these different
sexual experiences.

1325
01:43:02,309 --> 01:43:06,779
So in that way,
I have only one lover.

1326
01:43:10,884 --> 01:43:13,819
<i>Since the music</i>
<i>has three voices,</i>

1327
01:43:13,821 --> 01:43:17,256
<i>I will limit myself</i>
<i>to talking about three lovers.</i>

1328
01:43:18,692 --> 01:43:22,128
<i>That's f.</i>

1329
01:43:22,130 --> 01:43:26,232
<i>F had a red car</i>
<i>that he'd bought used.</i>

1330
01:43:28,368 --> 01:43:30,236
<i>As I was having sex</i>

1331
01:43:30,238 --> 01:43:33,606
<i>with seven or eight men</i>
<i>every night at the time,</i>

1332
01:43:33,608 --> 01:43:36,142
<i>scheduling was tricky</i>

1333
01:43:36,144 --> 01:43:39,512
<i>and they all had to have</i>
<i>precise appointments.</i>

1334
01:43:39,514 --> 01:43:42,148
<i>F was a good man.</i>

1335
01:43:42,150 --> 01:43:45,151
<i>If he was scheduled for 10:00,</i>

1336
01:43:45,153 --> 01:43:47,320
<i>he always showed up around 9:00</i>

1337
01:43:47,322 --> 01:43:49,622
<i>and parked down in the street.</i>

1338
01:43:49,624 --> 01:43:52,225
<i>I always smiled when I saw him.</i>

1339
01:43:53,393 --> 01:43:55,494
<i>Often I took pity on him</i>

1340
01:43:55,496 --> 01:43:57,230
<i>and gave him a cup of coffee</i>

1341
01:43:57,232 --> 01:43:59,932
<i>while I was finishing</i>
<i>with the one before.</i>

1342
01:44:02,502 --> 01:44:05,538
<i>It's hard to say why I'm
choosing to talk about f,</i>

1343
01:44:05,540 --> 01:44:07,807
<i>but he was reassuring,</i>

1344
01:44:07,809 --> 01:44:11,677
<i>and he knew exactly what</i>
<i>I wanted when we had sex.</i>

1345
01:44:11,679 --> 01:44:15,181
<i>No, I'd go even further and say</i>

1346
01:44:15,183 --> 01:44:18,718
<i>that there was a kind of telepathy
going on when we had sex.</i>

1347
01:44:18,720 --> 01:44:21,621
<i> Without words,</i>

1348
01:44:21,623 --> 01:44:23,789
<i>he knew exactly what I wanted,</i>

1349
01:44:23,791 --> 01:44:27,660
<i>where he should touch me</i>
<i>and what he should do.</i>

1350
01:44:29,263 --> 01:44:34,267
<i>The most sacred goal</i>
<i>for f was my orgasm.</i>

1351
01:44:34,269 --> 01:44:37,236
Well, and then...

1352
01:44:37,238 --> 01:44:41,474
the swans answered
in the same voice.

1353
01:44:41,476 --> 01:44:45,411
<i>And granted him privileges
none of the others received.</i>

1354
01:44:54,522 --> 01:44:58,424
<i>Monotone, predictable</i>
<i>and ritualistic.</i>

1355
01:44:58,426 --> 01:45:00,359
<i>No doubt about it.</i>

1356
01:45:00,361 --> 01:45:04,463
<i>But also the foundation</i>
<i>that is so important</i>

1357
01:45:04,465 --> 01:45:08,334
<i>even if, on its own,</i>
<i>it doesn't mean much.</i>

1358
01:45:39,599 --> 01:45:41,701
<i>G was quite different.</i>

1359
01:45:43,337 --> 01:45:47,373
<i>The only one I had to</i>
<i>and wanted to wait for.</i>

1360
01:45:47,375 --> 01:45:50,943
<i>When he finally turned up</i>
<i>and I opened the door,</i>

1361
01:45:50,945 --> 01:45:53,979
<i>he didn't immediately enter,</i>

1362
01:45:53,981 --> 01:45:56,649
<i>the way a cat doesn't</i>
<i>when you let it in,</i>

1363
01:45:56,651 --> 01:45:59,285
<i>as if once the door is open,</i>

1364
01:45:59,287 --> 01:46:01,954
<i>it has all the time</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

1365
01:46:08,562 --> 01:46:10,730
<i>But he was more than a cat.</i>

1366
01:46:10,732 --> 01:46:14,367
<i>He was like some kind of Jaguar
or leopard.</i>-

1367
01:46:16,002 --> 01:46:17,770
<i>He moved like them,</i>

1368
01:46:17,772 --> 01:46:21,006
<i>which turned me on no end.</i>

1369
01:46:30,751 --> 01:46:32,885
<i>He was in charge.</i>

1370
01:46:32,887 --> 01:46:35,454
<i>That's the way it was.</i>

1371
01:47:31,011 --> 01:47:33,479
<i>Despite
my success in managing</i>

1372
01:47:33,481 --> 01:47:36,649
<i>the complicated logistics</i>
<i>involved in arranging</i>

1373
01:47:36,651 --> 01:47:39,885
<i>up to 10 daily</i>
<i>sexual satisfactions</i>

1374
01:47:39,887 --> 01:47:42,988
<i>while also having</i>
<i>a full-time job,</i>

1375
01:47:42,990 --> 01:47:46,058
<i>I was still prone</i>
<i>to a certain sadness.</i>

1376
01:47:46,060 --> 01:47:49,428
<i>So when my busy life</i>
<i>allowed a few breaks,</i>

1377
01:47:49,430 --> 01:47:51,697
<i>I used them to take my walks.</i>

1378
01:47:52,699 --> 01:47:55,034
<i>These repeated walks became</i>

1379
01:47:57,505 --> 01:47:59,238
<i>Monotonous and pointless.</i>

1380
01:48:00,874 --> 01:48:03,642
<i> Yes, precisely like</i>

1381
01:48:03,644 --> 01:48:05,578
<i> the movements of a caged animal.</i>

1382
01:48:07,414 --> 01:48:10,249
<i>Basically, we're all waiting</i>
<i>for permission to die.</i>

1383
01:49:17,617 --> 01:49:19,485
<i>No.</i>

1384
01:49:19,487 --> 01:49:21,487
<i>No no no.</i>

1385
01:49:21,489 --> 01:49:22,888
No, there...

1386
01:49:22,890 --> 01:49:25,691
there are some completely
unrealistic coincidences

1387
01:49:25,693 --> 01:49:27,560
in your story about Jerome.

1388
01:49:29,162 --> 01:49:31,830
First, by chance
he hires you as...

1389
01:49:31,832 --> 01:49:34,700
As an assistant and then you
take a walk in a forest

1390
01:49:34,702 --> 01:49:36,702
that is littered
with photographs of him.

1391
01:49:36,704 --> 01:49:39,838
And not only that,
he's present.

1392
01:49:40,874 --> 01:49:42,575
And then like a God,

1393
01:49:42,577 --> 01:49:45,044
pulls you up to him
through the clouds.

1394
01:49:45,046 --> 01:49:47,580
<i>Goodness gracious.</i>

1395
01:49:49,096 --> 01:49:50,816
<i>Jerome was
there because he had</i>

1396
01:49:50,818 --> 01:49:52,585
<i>just had a fight with his wife,</i>

1397
01:49:52,587 --> 01:49:54,520
<i>who, in anger,</i>
<i>tore up the photographs</i>

1398
01:49:54,522 --> 01:49:56,655
<i>they just had developed</i>
<i>from their travels.</i>

1399
01:49:56,657 --> 01:49:59,224
<i>Oh, I don't
know if I can believe this.</i>

1400
01:49:59,226 --> 01:50:02,761
<i>Which way do you think
you'd get the most out of my story?</i>

1401
01:50:02,763 --> 01:50:05,698
<i>By believing in it</i>
<i>or by not believing in it?</i>

1402
01:50:05,700 --> 01:50:07,800
<i>No, you're right.</i>

1403
01:50:07,802 --> 01:50:09,835
<i>You might have</i>
<i>a point with all this.</i>

1404
01:50:13,541 --> 01:50:17,977
The secret
ingredient to sex is love.

1405
01:50:21,715 --> 01:50:23,282
The third voice:

1406
01:50:23,284 --> 01:50:25,050
The secret ingredient.

1407
01:50:25,052 --> 01:50:27,686
<i>Cantus firmus.</i>

1408
01:51:10,964 --> 01:51:13,165
Ah.

1409
01:51:46,966 --> 01:51:49,735
Fill all my holes.

1410
01:52:49,095 --> 01:52:52,164
What's wrong? Hmm?

1411
01:52:53,800 --> 01:52:55,968
I can't feel anything.

1412
01:52:55,970 --> 01:52:57,970
- Huh?
- I can't feel anything.

1413
01:53:00,340 --> 01:53:02,908
I can't feel anything.

1414
01:53:05,278 --> 01:53:07,713
I can't... anything.
