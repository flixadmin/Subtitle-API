1
00:02:16,287 --> 00:02:18,203
Son, have you studied
for your exams?

2
00:02:18,591 --> 00:02:20,299
-You have to write well, okay?
-Okay mom!

3
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,058
If you write your exams well,
then I would get you a big cake.

4
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:26,666
We'll cut your cake along
with your friends in the evening.

5
00:02:26,766 --> 00:02:27,933
-Okay?
-Happy birthday, dude.

6
00:02:28,016 --> 00:02:29,641
-Give chocolates to your friends.
--Thank you!

7
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,390
-Happy birthday, dude.
-Thank you Harish.

8
00:02:32,682 --> 00:02:34,849
-One more chocolate for me, dude.
-The bus is here.

9
00:02:35,016 --> 00:02:36,849
Give chocolates to your friends
in the bus. Okay?

10
00:02:37,016 --> 00:02:37,974
Okay, mom!

11
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:39,849
Get in carefully.
-Bye!

12
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:41,766
Mom, bye!
-Bye.

13
00:02:42,307 --> 00:02:43,599
Bye.
-Bye!

14
00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:48,140
"Happy birthday to you"

15
00:02:51,516 --> 00:02:52,290
Pour some more Sambar.

16
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,807
Don’t stand there.
Come here.

17
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:13,682
Sir, please buy one doll.

18
00:03:13,766 --> 00:03:15,307
My baby is crying in hunger.

19
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,058
Brother, please buy one doll.

20
00:03:17,641 --> 00:03:18,641
How much is it?

21
00:03:18,974 --> 00:03:20,140
-It is 10 rupees.
-Here, give it.

22
00:03:41,432 --> 00:03:42,432
Hey!

23
00:03:42,974 --> 00:03:44,182
The baby!

24
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,058
The baby is down there!

25
00:03:47,224 --> 00:03:48,224
Hey!

26
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:06,807
Hey, run!

27
00:04:30,099 --> 00:04:31,933
Hey kids, get down and run.
Run now!

28
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,165
Near Morampudi junction,
Near Rajahmundry,

29
00:04:57,265 --> 00:04:59,457
there was an explosion due
to poisonous gases,

30
00:04:59,557 --> 00:05:01,599
leaked from the sewage stagnant
in the manhole.

31
00:05:01,807 --> 00:05:05,557
I strongly condemn this on behalf
of the opposition.

32
00:05:05,849 --> 00:05:07,490
This is an unexpected accident.

33
00:05:07,498 --> 00:05:10,498
Government has announced compensation,
to the families of those who have died.

34
00:05:10,706 --> 00:05:12,581
I severely condemn the opposite
parties, who are trying to do

35
00:05:12,665 --> 00:05:14,039
politics through this accident.

36
00:05:14,248 --> 00:05:18,872
Hyderabad High Court has ordered this
case to be handed over to the CBI.

37
00:05:33,414 --> 00:05:36,565
The convention of Muthamizh
Munnetram Party is a huge success.

38
00:05:36,665 --> 00:05:39,956
Members of the party and public,
from all parts of area.

39
00:05:40,081 --> 00:05:44,314
have extended their tremendous
support to this convention.

40
00:05:44,414 --> 00:05:48,981
The Chief Minister, Ms. Dhatchayani
has said that, in spite of the many

41
00:05:49,081 --> 00:05:52,373
sabotages around her, the support
of the people has made her happy.

42
00:05:52,623 --> 00:05:54,747
Hail! CM!

43
00:05:55,456 --> 00:05:56,606
CM’s convoy has started.

44
00:05:56,706 --> 00:05:59,373
Stop all the public and tighten
the barricades.

45
00:06:00,747 --> 00:06:08,456
Hail! CM Dhatchayani!
Hail! CM Dhatchayani!

46
00:06:08,747 --> 00:06:10,289
Get back!
Hey! Go back!

47
00:06:15,623 --> 00:06:17,081
Move aside! Move aside!

48
00:06:17,206 --> 00:06:18,623
Move aside! Move aside!

49
00:06:20,373 --> 00:06:21,706
Move away!

50
00:06:24,206 --> 00:06:25,206
Hey!

51
00:06:25,456 --> 00:06:26,665
It’s the CM!

52
00:06:30,373 --> 00:06:34,373
Hail! CM Dhatchayani!
Hail! CM Dhatchayani!

53
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:47,456
Hey! Move aside.

54
00:06:48,623 --> 00:06:50,064
Move aside I say!
Come on! Come on!

55
00:06:50,164 --> 00:06:51,997
Move away, it is the CM.
-Come on! one minute!

56
00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:55,373
Sir? It is the ambulance.
-What are you doing?

57
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:56,872
Go on.
Go fast.

58
00:06:56,956 --> 00:06:58,456
Did we block the road for
the ambulance?

59
00:06:58,498 --> 00:07:00,606
Yes the ambulance can go only
if the traffic is blocked.

60
00:07:00,706 --> 00:07:02,331
It is the CM.
-But that is a life.

61
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:04,164
Hey?
-Sir, it is a small girl.

62
00:07:04,248 --> 00:07:05,665
She is covered in blood.
-So what?

63
00:07:05,747 --> 00:07:07,373
How dare you stop CM’s vehicle?

64
00:07:09,789 --> 00:07:16,123
Hail! CM Dhatchayani!
Hail! CM Dhatchayani!

65
00:07:29,665 --> 00:07:30,581
Tell me,

66
00:07:30,872 --> 00:07:32,747
will you stop the CM’s
vehicle for that?

67
00:07:32,789 --> 00:07:34,123
No ma’am. I am sorry.

68
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:36,997
You must stop like that.

69
00:07:37,914 --> 00:07:40,248
CM is not important than people.

70
00:07:42,081 --> 00:07:45,831
Will you not check for emergency
vehicles, before blocking the road?

71
00:07:46,498 --> 00:07:47,414
Sorry madam.

72
00:07:48,831 --> 00:07:51,581
Update me with the condition
of the girl in the ambulance.

73
00:07:51,831 --> 00:07:52,747
Okay ma’am.

74
00:07:56,789 --> 00:07:57,581
Shiva?

75
00:07:57,914 --> 00:08:00,373
Yes ma’am, Constable Shiva.
Sakinetipalli Police Station.

76
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,498
Good job Shiva!

77
00:08:02,914 --> 00:08:04,123
What you did is right.

78
00:08:04,914 --> 00:08:07,956
You and I, we all are here for
the people.

79
00:08:08,623 --> 00:08:12,081
If they are in trouble,
if there is benefit for everyone,

80
00:08:12,248 --> 00:08:14,623
then don’t mind even the CM
or the PM.

81
00:08:15,414 --> 00:08:17,914
Always stand bravely like this.

82
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,456
Good!

Oh God!
-Hey, leave my hand.

108
00:11:48,665 --> 00:11:50,064
I shall get up myself.
It is paining.

What sorry?

112
00:12:06,665 --> 00:12:09,581
No, a lady driver and just now
she is learning to drive.

113
00:12:09,747 --> 00:12:11,831
So sorry.
-Ladies can do anything is it?

114
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:15,373
Brother, do you know what I would
have done, if I was in your place?

115
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:16,747
What would you have done?

116
00:12:16,789 --> 00:12:18,289
I would have said,

117
00:12:18,747 --> 00:12:19,997
It's okay, it happens.

118
00:12:21,248 --> 00:12:22,123
Hey!

119
00:12:22,456 --> 00:12:26,706
If I say, there is scratch on my car,
you have to pay money, can you pay now?

120
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,373
You can’t right?
Then what?

121
00:12:29,414 --> 00:12:30,248
Now get going.

122
00:12:31,373 --> 00:12:33,123
What is there to stare here?
Go away.

123
00:12:34,914 --> 00:12:36,456
Well said baby.

124
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,623
What is this baby?

125
00:12:37,872 --> 00:12:39,481
How many times to tell you,
not to release the clutch suddenly?

126
00:12:39,581 --> 00:12:42,331
There was too much of traffic,
so I was a little confused.

127
00:12:42,373 --> 00:12:45,331
Do you expect to announce
a national holiday, when you drive?

128
00:12:46,331 --> 00:12:47,331
Start the car.
-Yeah.

129
00:12:52,665 --> 00:12:53,623
Oh god!

130
00:12:54,331 --> 00:12:55,331
What now?

131
00:12:55,414 --> 00:12:57,148
I was asked to stop.

132
00:12:57,248 --> 00:12:58,498
Who said that?
-Ah…

133
00:12:58,789 --> 00:12:59,747
Hmm.

134
00:12:59,872 --> 00:13:00,665
Hi!

135
00:13:03,289 --> 00:13:04,148
Thanks madam.

136
00:13:04,248 --> 00:13:05,289
Don’t call me madam.

137
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,498
Then?

138
00:13:06,789 --> 00:13:07,914
Just Julie.

139
00:13:07,997 --> 00:13:09,831
That is very important now.
-Thanks, Julie!

140
00:13:10,997 --> 00:13:12,789
You are sitting like you own
this car?

141
00:13:12,914 --> 00:13:13,956
Get out of the car.

142
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:15,665
What did I do?
I lifted my hand.

143
00:13:16,164 --> 00:13:17,914
She stopped and I got in.
That’s it.

144
00:13:17,956 --> 00:13:18,872
Don’t act too smart.

145
00:13:18,914 --> 00:13:20,248
I am just teaching her to
apply brakes.

146
00:13:20,498 --> 00:13:21,398
Get down from the car, now.

147
00:13:21,498 --> 00:13:22,540
Is it?

148
00:13:22,623 --> 00:13:24,540
Also teach her how to give
a lift.

149
00:13:25,289 --> 00:13:27,206
What do you say, Julie?
Come on let’s go.

150
00:13:31,498 --> 00:13:32,623
Look to your right.
-Hmm.

151
00:13:37,498 --> 00:13:38,540
Hey!

152
00:13:39,456 --> 00:13:41,106
Lunch box.
What is the special?

153
00:13:41,206 --> 00:13:42,456
-Tamarind rice.
-Stay away from that.

154
00:13:42,498 --> 00:13:43,647
-Is this fresh or old?
-Keep it down.

155
00:13:43,747 --> 00:13:44,831
-Please I want to eat it.
-Don’t touch it.

156
00:13:44,872 --> 00:13:46,148
I am telling you right?
Can’t you understand?

157
00:13:46,248 --> 00:13:47,581
I haven’t eaten anything
since night.

158
00:13:47,872 --> 00:13:49,039
Hey give me that.

159
00:13:49,248 --> 00:13:50,331
Please listen to me.
Why aren’t you listening?

160
00:13:50,373 --> 00:13:51,248
What are you doing?
-Please!

161
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,248
No, she is teaching you to drive,
when there is an argument in the car.

162
00:13:53,373 --> 00:13:54,706
You look ahead and drive.

163
00:13:54,789 --> 00:13:56,314
You keep driving.
-Will you not call me?

164
00:13:56,414 --> 00:13:58,647
Won’t you?
-Wait, what is your problem?

165
00:13:58,747 --> 00:13:59,939
My problem?

166
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,540
When did you promise to come
back from your hometown?

167
00:14:01,581 --> 00:14:04,206
They told it was going to be
for a day.

168
00:14:04,289 --> 00:14:07,515
But CM commanded me to stay
over there.

169
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,872
Are you a big shot, if the CM
appreciated you?

170
00:14:10,123 --> 00:14:12,498
Will you forget me?
-Hey! Take your hand off me.

171
00:14:12,581 --> 00:14:14,872
-Should I apply brake or the clutch?
-You do know the work of a cop.

172
00:14:14,956 --> 00:14:16,481
But I did call, someone else spoke.

173
00:14:16,581 --> 00:14:17,914
I don’t know all that.
-Oh!

174
00:14:17,956 --> 00:14:19,581
Are you both lovebirds?

175
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,706
We are not lovers Julie.

176
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:23,477
Oh!
-Just friends.

177
00:14:23,936 --> 00:14:25,560
Okay.
-You look ahead and drive.

178
00:14:25,644 --> 00:14:27,060
Careful and be steady.
-Today’s class is over.

179
00:14:27,102 --> 00:14:28,727
Keep aside! Put the indicator!
-That’s it.

180
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:29,894
Okay, okay!

181
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:31,185
Be on left!

182
00:14:31,268 --> 00:14:32,477
Yes, I am!

183
00:14:32,727 --> 00:14:34,060
Yes, yes! Stop the car!

184
00:14:35,227 --> 00:14:36,894
Your class is over, you can go.

185
00:14:37,394 --> 00:14:39,227
There is still half an hour
left, baby.

186
00:14:39,435 --> 00:14:40,335
No it is enough for now.

187
00:14:40,435 --> 00:14:42,352
Will you teach me the rest,
tomorrow?

188
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,727
Tomorrow I am off.
-Why?

189
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:46,894
A prospective groom is coming
to see me tomorrow. -Hey!

190
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,644
You didn’t tell me.
-Baby!

191
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,936
Congratulations.

192
00:14:55,727 --> 00:14:56,644
Who is that?

193
00:15:00,602 --> 00:15:01,435
Yeah, it is me.

194
00:15:01,894 --> 00:15:02,811
Prem?

195
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,685
Our school senior?

196
00:15:05,018 --> 00:15:06,519
Driving school Prem?

197
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,519
Yeah.

198
00:15:09,727 --> 00:15:10,769
Oh my!

199
00:15:10,894 --> 00:15:13,519
My parents were pestering me
about marriage, so I went there.

200
00:15:13,685 --> 00:15:15,519
And now he is torturing me
about love.

201
00:15:16,602 --> 00:15:17,727
Oh my god!

202
00:15:18,477 --> 00:15:19,769
Did you tell about our love?

203
00:15:23,852 --> 00:15:24,727
So what?

204
00:15:25,227 --> 00:15:26,894
I don’t have any problem
with that.

205
00:15:27,936 --> 00:15:29,227
What is the problem for him?

206
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,644
It is a problem for us.

207
00:15:31,477 --> 00:15:32,852
Why didn’t you slap him hard?

208
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,227
Like this…

209
00:15:39,936 --> 00:15:41,852
Revathi was in love with Karthik.

210
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:45,519
But later she understood love of Mohan,
and didn’t they live happily ever after?

211
00:15:46,727 --> 00:15:47,685
What?

212
00:15:47,852 --> 00:15:50,644
Karthik will die in that film,
but this fellow is still alive.

213
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:51,752
It’s okay.

214
00:15:51,852 --> 00:15:53,394
Hey! What is he talking?

215
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:56,185
He is talking about the movie,
Mouna Raagam.

216
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:58,769
He is planning to come
and talk with my parents.

217
00:15:58,977 --> 00:16:00,769
My dad knows him well.

218
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:03,836
Please, you come and talk
before he does.

219
00:16:03,936 --> 00:16:05,143
Hey, no way.

220
00:16:06,268 --> 00:16:07,852
You are senseless and so is he.

221
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:10,977
The dates for my SI exams
have been announced.

222
00:16:11,143 --> 00:16:12,560
I shall write that and then come.
You wait for me.

223
00:16:12,769 --> 00:16:14,227
What?
I should wait for you?

224
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,627
What do you think about me?

225
00:16:15,727 --> 00:16:17,602
First you asked me to wait,
till you got a job.

226
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:19,502
Then you asked me to wait
till you were posted.

227
00:16:19,602 --> 00:16:20,711
Now till you become an SI.

228
00:16:20,811 --> 00:16:23,310
I cannot wait till you become
the President of India.

229
00:16:23,394 --> 00:16:24,227
Hey!

230
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:26,435
There is no problem in me
coming and talking.

231
00:16:26,769 --> 00:16:28,477
But you do know about your father.

232
00:16:28,685 --> 00:16:29,585
If I come and talk to him,

233
00:16:29,685 --> 00:16:31,602
He will blabber about property,
status and caste. -Hey!

234
00:16:31,852 --> 00:16:33,477
Are you going to marry my father?

235
00:16:33,811 --> 00:16:34,727
It is me, right?

236
00:16:34,852 --> 00:16:35,769
I am telling you now.

237
00:16:35,811 --> 00:16:38,310
Tomorrow you come with your family to my
house, and ask for my hand in marriage.

238
00:16:48,185 --> 00:16:48,977
Please!

239
00:16:57,185 --> 00:16:58,018
Sir?

240
00:16:58,602 --> 00:17:00,085
Hi Shiva! When did you come?

241
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,268
Just now.

242
00:17:01,477 --> 00:17:03,477
You stopped the CM’s convoy is it?

243
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,769
Your name is in the newspapers.
You have become very famous.

244
00:17:05,894 --> 00:17:07,185
That was nothing sir.
-Super.

245
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:09,811
I was just making way for an ambulance,
they blew everything out of proportion.

246
00:17:09,936 --> 00:17:12,185
SI sir has asked you to come
and meet him.

247
00:17:12,477 --> 00:17:13,977
Hmm. I thought so.

248
00:17:14,477 --> 00:17:15,685
What is he going to say?

249
00:17:15,894 --> 00:17:20,310
I sent you to escort the CM’s convoy,
And how dare you stop them?

250
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:21,936
Huh? I will hit you.

251
00:17:24,852 --> 00:17:25,685
Hey!

252
00:17:25,936 --> 00:17:27,811
I sent you to escort the CM’s
convoy,

253
00:17:28,018 --> 00:17:29,519
And how dare you stop them?

254
00:17:30,852 --> 00:17:33,560
The officers appreciated
you there,

255
00:17:33,811 --> 00:17:37,143
but they have sent me a memo asking
about my inability to run a station.

256
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:39,644
Guys like this become police
through some quota,

257
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:42,602
without actually knowing
the nature of the job.

258
00:17:43,644 --> 00:17:45,602
Then they cause too much trouble
for us.

259
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:47,394
Hey!

260
00:17:47,727 --> 00:17:51,310
If I get any more complaints
like this,

261
00:17:52,268 --> 00:17:53,685
I will suspend you.
Get lost!

262
00:17:54,936 --> 00:17:55,936
Hey stop!

263
00:17:56,477 --> 00:17:58,268
Is this the time to report to
the station?

264
00:17:58,894 --> 00:18:00,602
I am going to write today as
an off for you.

265
00:18:00,852 --> 00:18:03,060
Also I want an off tomorrow sir.
-Why?

266
00:18:03,394 --> 00:18:04,936
My uncle is in a serious condition.

267
00:18:05,102 --> 00:18:05,936
Serious?

268
00:18:06,102 --> 00:18:07,394
It is pretty serious.
Yeah.

269
00:18:07,477 --> 00:18:09,002
Not only just three days,

270
00:18:09,102 --> 00:18:12,394
but we have to celebrate
this occasion every day.

271
00:18:12,644 --> 00:18:13,644
Well said.

272
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:17,685
When our CM appreciated my son

273
00:18:17,894 --> 00:18:20,685
do you know how happy I was?

274
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:25,394
That is why we are celebrating
for these three days.

275
00:18:25,852 --> 00:18:27,310
Is that right or wrong?

276
00:18:28,727 --> 00:18:29,894
Yes, thank you brother.

277
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,435
Mom, brother is here.

278
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,977
Everyone are jealous of you.

279
00:18:35,394 --> 00:18:37,936
Every evil eye should be
warded off.

280
00:18:42,769 --> 00:18:45,435
They should have published
your photo as well.

281
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:49,477
People all over are talking, you stopped
CM’s convoy, made way for an ambulance.

282
00:18:49,977 --> 00:18:53,185
But that newspaper didn’t even
publish your photo.

283
00:18:54,018 --> 00:18:55,936
Next time I will ask them to
do that, okay?

284
00:18:56,227 --> 00:18:58,352
Before that,
I have an important thing to say.

285
00:18:58,769 --> 00:18:59,977
Ah! Where is dad?

286
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:03,227
Shiva, I am giving you so many kisses,
can’t you give your father one?

287
00:19:03,394 --> 00:19:04,394
Dad?

288
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:06,435
Hey Shiva!
Look everyone, he is here.

289
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,252
I love you, dear.

290
00:19:07,352 --> 00:19:08,852
Shiva I love you.

291
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,394
Dad I have to tell something
important. Come inside.

292
00:19:13,477 --> 00:19:16,560
Why should you speak
important things here?

293
00:19:16,727 --> 00:19:18,644
Celebration is going on.

294
00:19:19,227 --> 00:19:21,477
Dad, it is very important. Why do
you keep talking with this guy?

295
00:19:21,602 --> 00:19:23,268
-Come on.
-Ok, coming!

296
00:19:23,936 --> 00:19:25,060
Hey!

297
00:19:25,394 --> 00:19:26,852
My son serious.

298
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:29,560
-I am go! You don’t drink, waiting!
-Go! Go!

299
00:19:29,811 --> 00:19:30,894
Wait!
-Okay, okay waiting!

300
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:32,185
-Waiting.
-No drinking.

301
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:39,894
Hm?

302
00:19:42,727 --> 00:19:43,560
Dad!

303
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:50,102
Dad I don’t know if you will become angry,
when you hear what I am about to say.

304
00:19:50,394 --> 00:19:52,102
You are not sure yourself right?

305
00:19:52,227 --> 00:19:53,519
Then we shall talk tomorrow.

306
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,227
Dad, Dad, no.
-Ah?

307
00:19:55,435 --> 00:19:56,727
I shall tell you.
Please sit down.

308
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:57,894
Ah…

309
00:19:58,227 --> 00:19:59,477
What is the matter?

310
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:00,894
Hey!

311
00:20:01,018 --> 00:20:02,185
Why are you here?

312
00:20:02,352 --> 00:20:04,143
We elders are talking right?
So get lost.

313
00:20:04,477 --> 00:20:06,894
Okay son, you carry on!
-Dad!

314
00:20:07,685 --> 00:20:08,685
No dad, not you.

315
00:20:08,811 --> 00:20:10,852
You please sit down.
Sit down!

316
00:20:15,477 --> 00:20:16,769
The matter is,

317
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:21,435
I studied in Baburaj School
when I was small, right?

318
00:20:26,352 --> 00:20:27,519
Sorry Chinna!

319
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:34,352
Fees was very less and that is
why I joined you there.

320
00:20:34,394 --> 00:20:36,460
Dad! It is not about the fees.

321
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,936
Dad!
-Huh?

322
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:40,477
Don’t interrupt me in-between.
I am losing my flow.

323
00:20:40,685 --> 00:20:41,769
Please listen to me.

324
00:20:42,018 --> 00:20:44,644
You too interrupted me
and brought me here.

325
00:20:44,811 --> 00:20:45,977
Did I tell you anything?

326
00:20:46,811 --> 00:20:47,852
Alright, fine.

327
00:20:49,227 --> 00:20:50,102
I.

328
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,477
Yes, you?

329
00:20:52,268 --> 00:20:53,352
In my childhood.

330
00:20:53,644 --> 00:20:55,102
Your childhood?

331
00:20:55,185 --> 00:20:56,143
There is a friend.

332
00:20:56,268 --> 00:20:58,477
Oh, is this about Revathi?
-Huh?

333
00:20:59,102 --> 00:21:00,143
Revathi?

334
00:21:01,268 --> 00:21:02,519
Revathi?

335
00:21:04,185 --> 00:21:05,060
Revathi.

336
00:21:05,394 --> 00:21:06,352
Who is that?

337
00:21:06,435 --> 00:21:10,143
Dad he is in love with a girl
since his childhood.

338
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,477
Love?
-She is a good girl.

339
00:21:12,018 --> 00:21:13,310
She is very pretty too.

340
00:21:13,394 --> 00:21:15,310
She is teaching driving in
Prem Driving School.

341
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:16,352
Is it?

342
00:21:16,394 --> 00:21:17,227
Just a minute dad.

343
00:21:18,018 --> 00:21:19,727
Hey! Where are you going?

344
00:21:20,727 --> 00:21:22,394
All that is fine Chinna,

345
00:21:22,685 --> 00:21:25,185
But you wanted to say
something important right?

346
00:21:25,394 --> 00:21:26,560
What is that?

347
00:21:30,227 --> 00:21:31,394
What?

348
00:21:31,894 --> 00:21:32,936
This is that girl.

349
00:21:36,227 --> 00:21:37,811
Why were you so hesitant
about this?

350
00:21:37,977 --> 00:21:40,102
She looks like a goddess.

351
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:41,977
Yes, mom!

352
00:21:48,769 --> 00:21:50,268
Not that song,

353
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:52,644
but this one.

354
00:21:58,352 --> 00:21:59,394
This is my song.

355
00:21:59,977 --> 00:22:01,435
-Let me sing it, please?
-Okay!

356
00:22:27,352 --> 00:22:31,310
“Hey come, to cherish my
lovable heart”

357
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:37,519
“Shall I show a preview of
my past and future?”

358
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,727
“Shall I paint the moment when
I saw you the first time?”

359
00:22:43,102 --> 00:22:46,268
“Shall I tell my entire life
in this one song?”

360
00:22:46,477 --> 00:22:50,143
“Hey come,
to cherish my lovable heart”

361
00:22:52,018 --> 00:22:56,644
“Shall I show a preview of
my past and future?”

362
00:22:59,394 --> 00:23:04,936
“Will I ever forget the hickeys
of my cheek?”

363
00:23:05,602 --> 00:23:09,685
“Will I ever forget when you
tied me in your white ribbon”

364
00:23:09,894 --> 00:23:12,352
“And took me away as your captive?”

365
00:23:44,018 --> 00:23:45,477
“You came to my school”

366
00:23:45,685 --> 00:23:46,977
“You took my pencil away”

367
00:23:50,477 --> 00:23:51,852
“You came to my school”

368
00:23:52,018 --> 00:23:53,560
“You took my pencil away”

369
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:58,268
“You came to my school”

370
00:23:58,477 --> 00:23:59,852
“You took my pencil away”

371
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:02,977
“And you rewrote my entire life”

372
00:24:03,143 --> 00:24:09,227
“You became my companion
in my college days”

373
00:24:09,644 --> 00:24:15,519
“You became my paper during
my exams”

374
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,769
“With the strength of mother”

375
00:24:17,811 --> 00:24:19,185
“And the affection of father”

376
00:24:19,394 --> 00:24:20,960
“You are going to rule over
my life”

377
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,727
“You are my better half,
my dear Revathi”

378
00:24:55,602 --> 00:24:59,352
“Hey come, come let’s cherish
the love of our hearts”

379
00:25:01,143 --> 00:25:05,977
“Let’s show on screen,
our love model that we saw

380
00:25:08,394 --> 00:25:09,894
“The skies are showering flowers”

381
00:25:10,102 --> 00:25:11,560
“The earth is celebrating”

382
00:25:11,727 --> 00:25:14,435
“The marriage that is
happening here”

383
00:25:14,769 --> 00:25:16,268
“Four grandsons”

384
00:25:16,477 --> 00:25:17,852
“Five granddaughters”

385
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,644
“They join hands and dance
with us”

386
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:21,102
“Can you see that vision now?”

387
00:25:21,268 --> 00:25:24,936
“Hey come, come let’s cherish
the love of our hearts”

388
00:25:26,769 --> 00:25:32,018
“Let’s show on screen,
our love model that we saw”

389
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:41,402
Keep it there.

390
00:25:44,819 --> 00:25:47,111
Should we have to go in this vehicle?
-Hey! That is not right.

391
00:25:47,402 --> 00:25:48,735
Don’t talk like that.

392
00:25:48,944 --> 00:25:51,111
This is Goddess Annapoorni
that feeds us.

393
00:25:51,194 --> 00:25:53,527
Well said.
You have spoken such wise word.

394
00:25:53,819 --> 00:25:56,694
My brother-in-law came to see
your mother, in this same vehicle.

395
00:25:56,819 --> 00:25:58,819
Keep all this together.
-Even then I was in same position.

396
00:25:59,069 --> 00:26:01,568
Look even he is doing same thing.
I am very delighted.

397
00:26:01,735 --> 00:26:03,860
Where are you all off to?

398
00:26:05,277 --> 00:26:07,069
I am asking, right?
Where are you going?

399
00:26:07,194 --> 00:26:09,218
Dad! Brother told you already.

400
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:12,236
Ramamurthy’s daughter,
school, love, marriage…

401
00:26:12,318 --> 00:26:14,485
You too said that the song
was superb.

402
00:26:14,652 --> 00:26:17,069
Hey! Was that you in that song?

403
00:26:17,527 --> 00:26:18,360
Dad!

404
00:26:18,652 --> 00:26:20,318
I even took you to all
the locations.

405
00:26:20,402 --> 00:26:21,652
How many times have I told you,

406
00:26:21,777 --> 00:26:24,236
not to say anything to me
when I am drunk?

407
00:26:24,443 --> 00:26:25,427
It is all because of you.

408
00:26:25,527 --> 00:26:27,527
Fine, tell me
where you are going now?

409
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:30,777
I told you that we are going to
meet the bride for Shiva.

410
00:26:31,735 --> 00:26:33,777
Okay, I shall get ready…
ready and come.

411
00:26:33,819 --> 00:26:35,610
Alright dad, come soon.
It’s already late.

412
00:26:36,777 --> 00:26:38,194
But I have one doubt.

413
00:26:38,443 --> 00:26:40,360
Where did you meet this girl?

414
00:26:40,568 --> 00:26:41,902
Hey! Dharmaraja!

415
00:26:42,111 --> 00:26:43,944
I will lock you up in jail.
-Okay....okay.

416
00:26:43,985 --> 00:26:45,194
Sorry, I will get ready now.

417
00:28:03,313 --> 00:28:03,687
Shiva!

418
00:28:03,711 --> 00:28:05,170
Hey Revathi!
-What is this?

419
00:28:05,295 --> 00:28:07,878
We are being humiliated
and you are just watching.

420
00:28:11,461 --> 00:28:12,920
Listen, if you want me,

421
00:28:12,962 --> 00:28:14,753
come with me now with the sari
you are wearing.

422
00:28:15,045 --> 00:28:16,254
We will take good care of you.

423
00:28:16,337 --> 00:28:18,254
Or if you say, I want my father
and I will listen to him,

424
00:28:18,295 --> 00:28:19,711
then you better marry him.

425
00:28:20,628 --> 00:28:21,586
Forget me.

426
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:27,503
Come on dad.

427
00:28:39,379 --> 00:28:41,420
Hey! If you are a police you
would do anything is it?

428
00:28:41,628 --> 00:28:43,528
You have caused a ruckus with
the bride’s family at the temple.

429
00:28:43,628 --> 00:28:45,087
You have beaten everyone there.

430
00:28:45,212 --> 00:28:46,795
I didn’t cause any problem sir.

431
00:28:47,087 --> 00:28:48,545
That girl and I are in love.

432
00:28:48,795 --> 00:28:50,170
I went to ask her hand in
marriage and that’s it.

433
00:28:50,212 --> 00:28:53,003
Then why has Ramamurthy come to
the station, to file case against you?

434
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:57,420
You do know what would happen,
if I take up his complaint, right?

435
00:28:59,295 --> 00:29:00,212
Listen,

436
00:29:00,753 --> 00:29:03,420
I assured him that you would
never interfere in her life.

437
00:29:03,753 --> 00:29:05,837
So he went away without filing
a case.

438
00:29:06,254 --> 00:29:07,670
You said that I wouldn’t interfere?

439
00:29:07,878 --> 00:29:09,295
Sir that is my personal issue.

440
00:29:09,545 --> 00:29:11,128
Why are you interfering?

441
00:29:11,295 --> 00:29:12,212
Personal issue?

442
00:29:12,295 --> 00:29:14,920
Then shall I file an FIR and lock
you and your parents in jail?

443
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:16,045
Sir,

444
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:18,586
I know why you are supporting them.

445
00:29:19,003 --> 00:29:19,962
What do you know?

446
00:29:20,128 --> 00:29:21,003
What do you know?

447
00:29:21,586 --> 00:29:23,461
Tell me, what do you know?
-Sir, just a moment, please.

448
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:24,837
First you go out.

449
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,503
Don’t you know how to talk
to a senior officer?

450
00:29:28,962 --> 00:29:29,962
You go inside sir.

451
00:29:30,087 --> 00:29:31,254
I shall deal with him later.

452
00:29:32,962 --> 00:29:34,128
You come here.

453
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:37,795
Why are you so arrogant?

454
00:29:38,212 --> 00:29:40,212
Already that fellow has
a grudge on you.

455
00:29:40,503 --> 00:29:42,962
Even after knowing this, how
could you back answer him, Shiva?

456
00:29:43,003 --> 00:29:46,461
Sir, ask him to treat
every complaint equally.

457
00:29:47,337 --> 00:29:49,586
He treats the rich differently
from the poor.

458
00:29:49,795 --> 00:29:51,170
But now he preaches justice.

459
00:29:51,212 --> 00:29:52,128
Shiva!

460
00:29:52,295 --> 00:29:54,670
Don’t make him to come out again.

461
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,128
Look, there is a missed call.

462
00:29:58,254 --> 00:29:59,670
For you only.
Speak now.

463
00:30:03,045 --> 00:30:04,170
Go and speak.

464
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:07,461
Hey!

465
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:10,003
Why do you keep calling me
again and again?

466
00:30:11,045 --> 00:30:12,503
Why are you shouting like this?

467
00:30:12,628 --> 00:30:13,711
I want to talk with you.

468
00:30:13,753 --> 00:30:15,878
I am waiting near the phone booth
outside. Come now.

469
00:30:15,962 --> 00:30:17,878
What you spoke yesterday
was more than enough.

470
00:30:18,212 --> 00:30:19,379
I have lot of work now.

471
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,170
I cannot come, you can leave.
-Hey!

472
00:30:21,628 --> 00:30:23,795
I have to talk about
an important thing. Please come.

473
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:26,379
Listen, already I have
too many issues.

474
00:30:26,795 --> 00:30:28,212
I cannot come out now.

475
00:30:28,545 --> 00:30:29,711
Don’t act too smart.

476
00:30:30,003 --> 00:30:32,087
If you don’t come out now,
then I will come inside.

477
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:40,337
Alright, I will come.

478
00:30:42,837 --> 00:30:44,878
Sir, I am going out for tea.
-Huh!

479
00:30:44,962 --> 00:30:46,170
Fine, fine…

480
00:30:46,545 --> 00:30:48,337
you can even have breakfast
if you want.

481
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,254
Sir?

482
00:31:02,337 --> 00:31:03,711
I have come out of my house.

483
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,254
Come, let’s get married.

484
00:31:06,254 --> 00:31:07,045
Hey!

485
00:31:07,212 --> 00:31:09,337
You only told me to come with
the sari that I am wearing.

486
00:31:09,545 --> 00:31:11,045
Now I have come with a Chudidhar.

487
00:31:11,337 --> 00:31:12,545
Come, let’s get married.

488
00:31:13,379 --> 00:31:15,170
Great, now you are talking nicely.

489
00:31:15,753 --> 00:31:17,753
But yesterday you were
keeping mum.

490
00:31:19,128 --> 00:31:21,295
Fine, there were elders around
and I accept that.

491
00:31:21,503 --> 00:31:23,087
But what did my parents do?

492
00:31:23,878 --> 00:31:25,503
You told me and that is why
I brought them.

493
00:31:26,045 --> 00:31:27,628
But when they were humiliated…

494
00:31:30,212 --> 00:31:31,878
I don’t know Shiva.
-Yeah,

495
00:31:32,795 --> 00:31:33,903
without knowing anything only,

496
00:31:34,003 --> 00:31:36,003
You came all dressed up like
a doll, isn’t it?

497
00:31:36,711 --> 00:31:38,820
I came dressed up because I thought
your parents would be there.

498
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,795
Yeah, yeah!

499
00:31:39,837 --> 00:31:41,420
They said that we were going
to the temple.

500
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:43,586
That is why I asked you to
come there and talk.

501
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:45,837
I really didn’t know
that they would be there.

502
00:31:49,753 --> 00:31:50,586
Now what?

503
00:31:51,795 --> 00:31:53,237
Because of what happened yesterday,

504
00:31:53,337 --> 00:31:56,295
They have planned to get me
secretly married at Thirupathi.

505
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,087
You tie the sacred thread on
my neck now.

506
00:31:59,128 --> 00:31:59,878
Hey!

507
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:01,670
Stop this nonsense!

508
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:05,878
Your father has given a complaint
on me and my family.

509
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,795
This SI is torturing me with that.

510
00:32:09,003 --> 00:32:10,545
So I cannot come with you now.

511
00:32:11,254 --> 00:32:12,628
We have no time to think, Shiva.

512
00:32:13,586 --> 00:32:15,337
I cannot live with anybody else.

513
00:32:16,461 --> 00:32:17,920
I don’t know what you would do.

514
00:32:18,628 --> 00:32:20,670
But please come
and take me with you.

515
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:29,295
Or else, I shall decide my end.

516
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:31,003
Hey!

517
00:32:37,962 --> 00:32:38,837
Alright,

518
00:32:40,212 --> 00:32:41,878
I will do something by evening.

519
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:44,628
Okay?

520
00:32:58,087 --> 00:32:59,628
Where is sir, coming from now?

521
00:33:00,003 --> 00:33:01,212
I went to have some tea.

522
00:33:01,545 --> 00:33:03,461
Hmm. Mohanraj?
-Sir?

523
00:33:04,003 --> 00:33:06,753
You asked for leave to attend
some wedding right?

524
00:33:06,837 --> 00:33:07,611
You can leave now.

525
00:33:07,711 --> 00:33:08,962
That wedding is tomorrow sir.

526
00:33:09,128 --> 00:33:10,503
You can take two days off.

527
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:12,170
Go now.
-Okay sir, thank you sir.

528
00:33:12,753 --> 00:33:14,003
Shiva, you start the vehicle.

529
00:33:16,586 --> 00:33:18,586
I am talking to you,
start the vehicle.

530
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,711
Go and start now.

531
00:33:35,254 --> 00:33:36,670
Even now she came and met him.

532
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,920
Oh, that’s the matter!

533
00:33:39,045 --> 00:33:40,753
Okay, Rangappa, I will look
into it!

534
00:33:41,212 --> 00:33:43,586
Hey! Don’t get drunk
and embarrass us here.

535
00:33:44,212 --> 00:33:45,711
Where were you all this while?

536
00:33:45,878 --> 00:33:47,154
I went to the driving class.
Why?

537
00:33:47,254 --> 00:33:49,295
-How are you? -I am fine,
you go inside. Go inside.

538
00:34:12,753 --> 00:34:14,586
Take me to IG’s office.

539
00:34:16,461 --> 00:34:18,170
S.I. called just now!

540
00:34:18,254 --> 00:34:19,837
He just spoke to me about, Shiva!

541
00:34:20,212 --> 00:34:22,711
We should be careful,
they are planning something!

542
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:34,962
I will take care of everything,
Mangalam. Tomorrow…

543
00:34:35,128 --> 00:34:36,795
-What is it, dear? Oh!
-No…nothing.

544
00:34:37,087 --> 00:34:38,003
Hey Bharani, come here.

545
00:34:38,045 --> 00:34:40,670
It’s Revathi’s marriage
tomorrow at Tirupathi!

546
00:34:41,503 --> 00:34:42,795
Shiva?
-Yes sir.

547
00:34:44,087 --> 00:34:45,087
What are you doing?

548
00:34:45,128 --> 00:34:46,586
Go and get the vehicle.
-Yes, sir!

549
00:34:46,962 --> 00:34:47,945
Revathi… here.

550
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:49,670
Mom, I shall come out and eat.

551
00:34:49,711 --> 00:34:51,420
No need, you can eat here.

552
00:34:51,461 --> 00:34:52,611
What is happening here?

553
00:34:52,711 --> 00:34:53,486
I am telling you right?

554
00:34:53,586 --> 00:34:55,295
I you want anything,
just call me.

555
00:35:06,837 --> 00:35:09,087
Hey Shiva, you didn’t do
any work the entire day.

556
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,837
So go, do the night shift at
the station. -Sir?

557
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:13,254
What man?

558
00:35:13,295 --> 00:35:15,503
Since morning you were just roaming
around here and there, right?

559
00:35:17,087 --> 00:35:18,087
Go now!

560
00:35:23,878 --> 00:35:25,420
I don’t know what you would do.

561
00:35:26,045 --> 00:35:27,503
Come and take me with you somehow.

562
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,045
Otherwise, I will meet my
own fate.

563
00:35:40,503 --> 00:35:42,337
Shiva, did he let you go,
just now?

564
00:35:42,461 --> 00:35:43,445
Yes, sir!

565
00:35:43,545 --> 00:35:45,670
Sir! Did Revathi call you?

566
00:35:46,254 --> 00:35:47,320
No, what happened?

567
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:49,379
She told me that her parents are
going to take her to Thirupathi,

568
00:35:49,503 --> 00:35:51,003
and get her secretly married
there tomorrow.

569
00:35:51,045 --> 00:35:52,337
-Really?
-Yes sir!

570
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,295
Mani sir, I am leaving.
-Yeah.

571
00:35:54,503 --> 00:35:55,461
Bye Shiva.

572
00:35:55,628 --> 00:35:57,670
There will be problems if I
go there.

573
00:35:57,878 --> 00:35:59,878
Will you come with me?
We shall go and see what happened.

574
00:35:59,962 --> 00:36:01,379
What question is this?
Come, let’s go.

575
00:36:01,545 --> 00:36:02,420
But…

576
00:36:02,795 --> 00:36:04,586
SI asked me to do the night duty.

577
00:36:04,878 --> 00:36:06,837
Let’s tell him that we went
for night rounds. Come on.

578
00:36:06,962 --> 00:36:08,045
-Really?
-Yes!

579
00:36:08,337 --> 00:36:10,212
Okay I shall change my dress
and come. -Yeah come soon.

580
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:13,461
What do you lack Shiva?

581
00:36:13,545 --> 00:36:15,295
You would get promoted as
SI soon.

582
00:36:15,795 --> 00:36:17,528
Her father doesn’t want SI,

583
00:36:17,628 --> 00:36:19,003
He wants cash and caste.

584
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:22,628
Is that fool going to build
a family with money?

585
00:36:22,837 --> 00:36:24,170
Times are changing now Shiva.

586
00:36:24,295 --> 00:36:26,195
It is enough if the guy and
the girl like each other.

587
00:36:26,295 --> 00:36:27,837
Hey!! Hey!!

588
00:36:28,128 --> 00:36:29,003
Shiva!

589
00:36:49,045 --> 00:36:50,753
Sir, are you alright?
I hope you are not hurt?

590
00:36:50,837 --> 00:36:51,837
Nothing happened.

591
00:36:55,212 --> 00:36:56,503
Give me the match box.

592
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:00,503
Hey Raju, don’t cause any problem.
Come let’s go.

593
00:37:01,711 --> 00:37:02,795
Get lost!

594
00:37:03,003 --> 00:37:04,461
Hey! Hey, stop!

595
00:37:04,503 --> 00:37:05,611
Don’t cause any problem.

596
00:37:05,711 --> 00:37:07,170
Hey, listen to me!

597
00:37:07,212 --> 00:37:09,545
Hey no, let go!
Listen to what I say.

598
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:11,087
Leave it!
-What did you say?

599
00:37:11,628 --> 00:37:13,545
How dare you touch a police?

600
00:37:14,212 --> 00:37:15,628
This doesn’t concern you.

601
00:37:15,837 --> 00:37:16,670
Let go!

602
00:37:16,962 --> 00:37:17,670
Hey!

603
00:37:21,837 --> 00:37:24,420
Hey! I am warning you, come on.

604
00:37:24,545 --> 00:37:25,711
Will you shoot me?

605
00:37:28,962 --> 00:37:30,087
No Raju.
-A gun!

606
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:31,962
Raju listen to me.
-Hey! Leave the gun.

607
00:37:32,212 --> 00:37:34,128
Put the gun down.
Who are you guys?

608
00:37:34,295 --> 00:37:36,212
I am telling you, right?
Put the gun down.

609
00:37:36,461 --> 00:37:38,337
Go now!
-Hey! Mani sir!

610
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,254
Hey!

611
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,212
I am telling you.

612
00:37:42,628 --> 00:37:43,337
Hey!

613
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:46,254
Hey, don’t shoot.
Hey I am from CBI.

614
00:37:46,295 --> 00:37:48,295
Don’t move.
Put the gun down. Listen to me.

615
00:37:48,337 --> 00:37:49,920
-Stand there.
-Listen to me. Don’t shoot.

616
00:37:50,003 --> 00:37:51,962
-Hey! Don’t talk here, come to
the station. -Listen to me.

617
00:37:52,337 --> 00:37:54,920
I am telling you right? Stand there.
-He is an accused, man.

618
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:57,962
-Listen to what I say. I am from CBI.
-What are you doing?

619
00:37:58,045 --> 00:38:00,379
You can explain everything at station.
- I am telling you right?

620
00:38:00,545 --> 00:38:02,503
Don’t shoot him.
Put the gun down.

621
00:38:03,128 --> 00:38:04,420
Get up, what are you doing?

622
00:38:05,003 --> 00:38:05,903
Put the gun down.

623
00:38:06,003 --> 00:38:07,461
What are you doing?
-Put the gun down.

624
00:38:07,753 --> 00:38:09,337
Hey….
Sir, at least you tell him sir.

625
00:38:10,461 --> 00:38:11,795
Sir, please tell him.

626
00:38:12,212 --> 00:38:13,087
Tell me.

627
00:38:13,254 --> 00:38:14,503
Do you have a matchbox?

628
00:38:19,337 --> 00:38:21,045
Ma’am, a call for you.
-Who is that?

629
00:38:21,254 --> 00:38:23,003
Raju’s brother Ravi is online.

630
00:38:27,087 --> 00:38:27,920
Tell me.

631
00:38:27,962 --> 00:38:30,254
Madam! CBI has arrested Raju madam.

632
00:38:31,003 --> 00:38:31,795
When?

633
00:38:36,753 --> 00:38:38,212
Ask them to bring the side dish.

634
00:38:39,837 --> 00:38:41,670
Hello? Yeah tell me?

635
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:43,337
What are you saying?

636
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,170
Brother, the police are here.
Escape now!

637
00:38:54,503 --> 00:38:55,711
I asked only for a side dish.

638
00:38:55,837 --> 00:38:58,170
I have been searching for you
for the past 44 hours.

639
00:38:58,586 --> 00:38:59,320
For side dish?

640
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,878
Central Bureau of Investigation.

641
00:39:04,503 --> 00:39:05,420
Okay!

642
00:39:21,461 --> 00:39:23,420
Do you have a matchbox?
-No, bro!

643
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:25,628
Why do you come to a party
without a matchbox?

644
00:39:28,795 --> 00:39:29,837
A matchbox…

645
00:39:29,962 --> 00:39:30,878
Hmm, sorry!

646
00:39:34,337 --> 00:39:35,128
Hey!

647
00:39:35,962 --> 00:39:37,170
Do you have a matchbox?

648
00:39:37,795 --> 00:39:38,670
A matchbox?

649
00:39:38,962 --> 00:39:40,128
No, no!

650
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,295
Go to the place that I tell you.

651
00:40:12,337 --> 00:40:13,628
Hey leave me.

652
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:15,254
Hey leave me I say.

653
00:40:17,461 --> 00:40:18,837
Just now, madam!
One hour ago!

654
00:40:18,962 --> 00:40:19,837
Which area?

655
00:40:20,003 --> 00:40:21,628
Hello sir!
We need to go to hospital!

656
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,903
Hello, listen to what I say.
Hello, excuse me!

657
00:40:22,945 --> 00:40:24,111
Hey! Just shut up!

658
00:40:24,403 --> 00:40:26,303
He is shouting like a beggar and
says he is a CBI officer.

659
00:40:26,403 --> 00:40:27,320
I am talking to you.

660
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:28,637
Listen to me.

661
00:40:28,737 --> 00:40:29,903
-You call to SI!
-Hello Mani, why don’t you tell him?

662
00:40:29,945 --> 00:40:31,428
-Let’s go to the hospital.
-Mani, I am a CBI officer.

663
00:40:31,528 --> 00:40:33,137
Brother, please take care.
I shall call the SI.

664
00:40:33,237 --> 00:40:34,403
-Okay, sir!
-Please listen to me.

665
00:40:34,445 --> 00:40:36,178
-Listen to what I say.
-Hey shut your mouth.

666
00:40:36,278 --> 00:40:37,595
Listen to me guys, please!

667
00:40:37,695 --> 00:40:40,512
At least make a call to the number,
then you will know who I am.

668
00:40:40,612 --> 00:40:41,945
He is lying… He is lying.

669
00:40:41,986 --> 00:40:43,237
You shut your mouth.

670
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,445
He is giving you the number of the hotel,
where he goes to do his shady business.

671
00:40:45,487 --> 00:40:46,803
You call to the number I give you.
-Hey, don’t confuse them.

672
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:47,861
The CM will pick up the call.

673
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:49,070
Listen to me, hello!

674
00:40:49,237 --> 00:40:51,362
-Hello excuse me.
-Yeah tell me, I can hear you.

675
00:40:51,403 --> 00:40:52,195
Shut your mouth.

676
00:40:52,237 --> 00:40:53,779
Hey, you shut up man.
-You shut up.

677
00:40:53,945 --> 00:40:54,820
You shut up.

678
00:41:02,695 --> 00:41:03,362
Hello?

679
00:41:03,403 --> 00:41:05,195
Sir, this is Shiva from
the station.

680
00:41:05,654 --> 00:41:06,820
Yeah, tell me Shiva.

681
00:41:09,612 --> 00:41:11,803
Sir, when Writer Mani
and I were in night rounds,

682
00:41:11,903 --> 00:41:14,403
two drunken guys
came and dashed on our vehicle.

683
00:41:14,779 --> 00:41:15,945
Is anybody injured?

684
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:18,528
No sir,
all are fine except for Mani sir.

685
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:19,903
He has a mild bruise.

686
00:41:22,945 --> 00:41:24,237
What are those guys doing?

687
00:41:24,278 --> 00:41:25,779
Sir! They are in the lock-up.

688
00:41:26,028 --> 00:41:27,986
One fellow claims to be a CBI,

689
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,945
while the other one says that
he knows the CM.

690
00:41:29,986 --> 00:41:31,195
Directly CM is it?

691
00:41:31,612 --> 00:41:33,070
No MLA and MP?

692
00:41:33,528 --> 00:41:34,695
They are both drunk.

693
00:41:34,779 --> 00:41:36,153
Shall I file an FIR?

694
00:41:36,278 --> 00:41:38,345
No need, I shall come in
the morning and deal with this.

695
00:41:38,445 --> 00:41:39,820
Till then let them stay in
the lock-up.

696
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:40,986
Okay sir.

697
00:41:42,362 --> 00:41:44,153
Natraj! Raju is caught by the CBI.

698
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,153
When madam?

699
00:41:45,195 --> 00:41:46,695
About 25 minutes ago.

700
00:41:47,153 --> 00:41:48,986
Where?
-Near sakhinetipalli area.

701
00:41:50,403 --> 00:41:52,278
I don’t know what you will do.

702
00:41:53,445 --> 00:41:56,195
There should not be any problem,
when I wake up in the morning.

703
00:41:56,903 --> 00:41:58,320
Okay madam,
I shall take care.

704
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:02,986
Revathi,

705
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:06,070
I asked you to stay in
the room, right?

706
00:42:06,111 --> 00:42:07,654
Where are you going now?
-To the bathroom.

707
00:42:07,779 --> 00:42:09,487
Do I need permission even
for that? -Hm?

708
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,153
Hey!

709
00:42:12,237 --> 00:42:14,111
My wedding is in the morning, and
you are calling me to drink tonight?

710
00:42:14,153 --> 00:42:16,403
What will Revathi think about me?
Won’t she think that I am a drunkard?

711
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:18,320
You guys are the bad influence
to the society.

712
00:42:18,445 --> 00:42:19,111
Huh?

713
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:35,153
Sir?
-Tell me Shiva?

714
00:42:35,195 --> 00:42:36,903
SI sir will come only in
the morning.

715
00:42:36,986 --> 00:42:38,612
He said that both of them should
be locked up till then.

716
00:42:38,903 --> 00:42:39,945
Okay Shiva.
-Hello!

717
00:42:39,986 --> 00:42:41,428
Please listen to me.
-I have a small work.

718
00:42:41,528 --> 00:42:43,111
Can you handle till I come?
-Okay Shiva.

719
00:42:43,362 --> 00:42:44,861
-I shall take care.
-Please don’t go.

720
00:42:45,111 --> 00:42:46,945
Please don’t go.
Listen to me.

721
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:48,570
I am a CBI officer.

722
00:42:48,654 --> 00:42:50,070
Sir he is a big accused.

723
00:42:50,153 --> 00:42:52,262
I got to surrender him in court tomorrow.
Please come back, sir! - Match box!

724
00:42:52,362 --> 00:42:53,779
Listen to what I say sir.

725
00:42:54,153 --> 00:42:55,403
Sir…Sir…

726
00:42:56,028 --> 00:42:57,570
Sir listen to me.

727
00:42:57,737 --> 00:42:58,487
Hey!

728
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:00,695
Tell your stories to SI sir in
the morning.

729
00:43:01,028 --> 00:43:02,345
You blabbering drunkard!

730
00:43:02,445 --> 00:43:04,861
Hey! I am telling you so much
and still you are leaving?

731
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,028
Hey! Are you a policeman?

732
00:43:09,111 --> 00:43:11,528
Can’t you look into a man’s eyes,
and know that he is a criminal?

733
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:15,195
Hey! Do you know how many murders
he has committed?

734
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,737
He killed an SI in Kakinada station.

735
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:20,403
Check into old case files and
you will know who Raju is.

736
00:43:20,445 --> 00:43:21,237
Hey!

737
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,528
It is not Raju.

738
00:43:24,528 --> 00:43:25,820
It is Razu.

739
00:43:48,612 --> 00:43:50,528
About 4 years ago,
in morampudi junction,

740
00:43:50,612 --> 00:43:52,779
there was a blast due to
gas leakage in drainage, right?

741
00:43:54,779 --> 00:43:56,111
40 people died in that incident.

742
00:43:56,195 --> 00:43:57,278
He did that.

743
00:43:57,528 --> 00:43:59,861
If you don’t believe me, then call
and enquire to the number I give you.

744
00:44:11,153 --> 00:44:12,111
Hey,
-Sir!

745
00:44:12,237 --> 00:44:14,028
don’t call to the number that
he gives you. -Listen to me!

746
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:15,820
-Instead, call the number I give you.
-He is an accused. Come here!

747
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:17,695
CM will come in that line.
-Listen to me! Come!

748
00:44:17,903 --> 00:44:19,528
Then you will know about this Raju.
-Please!

749
00:44:19,903 --> 00:44:21,320
Come here! LIsten to me!

750
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:25,195
Look here! This is the number
of my chief officer.

751
00:44:25,362 --> 00:44:27,362
Call and inform him
that we are here.

752
00:44:27,528 --> 00:44:29,695
We have to submit him in
Bangalore Court in two days.

753
00:44:30,028 --> 00:44:31,237
We should not be here.

754
00:44:31,737 --> 00:44:33,195
Government is behind him.

755
00:44:33,695 --> 00:44:35,487
So it is not safe for us to
be here.

756
00:44:35,695 --> 00:44:38,095
This is my chief’s number,
call him.

757
00:44:38,195 --> 00:44:40,237
Go….Go…please, there is no time.

758
00:44:40,445 --> 00:44:41,570
Please go. Go.

759
00:44:50,028 --> 00:44:51,237
Be careful.

760
00:44:55,654 --> 00:44:56,528
Go.

761
00:44:56,737 --> 00:44:58,403
Wait, you can’t come in.

762
00:44:58,528 --> 00:44:59,612
He is my son doctor.

763
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:01,237
He met with an accident.
-Sir, please wait.

764
00:45:04,487 --> 00:45:06,637
He is our only son.

765
00:45:06,737 --> 00:45:08,654
I can’t live without him.
-You don’t worry.

766
00:45:08,737 --> 00:45:09,861
Nothing will happen to him.

767
00:45:12,362 --> 00:45:13,153
Hello?

768
00:45:13,612 --> 00:45:14,278
Hello

769
00:45:14,695 --> 00:45:16,487
Mr. Varghese?
-Yes?

770
00:45:16,695 --> 00:45:18,945
Do you know anyone called George?

771
00:45:20,028 --> 00:45:21,487
George?
Who are you?

772
00:45:21,945 --> 00:45:23,111
Is George with you?

773
00:45:23,153 --> 00:45:25,111
I am calling from
sakhinetipalli Police Station.

774
00:45:25,695 --> 00:45:26,654
George is here.

775
00:45:26,737 --> 00:45:28,278
We have arrested him in drunk
and drive case.

776
00:45:28,362 --> 00:45:29,195
Arrest?

777
00:45:29,695 --> 00:45:31,779
No, No, No.
What is your name?

778
00:45:32,612 --> 00:45:34,237
Shiva, Constable Shiva.

779
00:45:34,362 --> 00:45:35,403
Look Shiva!

780
00:45:35,695 --> 00:45:36,737
I am Varghese.

781
00:45:36,779 --> 00:45:38,320
CBI Investigative Head.

782
00:45:38,695 --> 00:45:40,737
It is not safe for George
to be in your station.

783
00:45:41,153 --> 00:45:42,570
First give the phone to him.

784
00:45:42,861 --> 00:45:43,928
Is Raju with him?

785
00:45:44,028 --> 00:45:45,403
Yes, Raju is here.
-Shiva!

786
00:45:47,528 --> 00:45:48,178
Hello?

787
00:45:48,278 --> 00:45:50,070
Yeah, I will ask George to
call you.

788
00:45:50,195 --> 00:45:50,903
Hello?

789
00:45:51,986 --> 00:45:53,195
Hey Shiva?
-Sir?

790
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,028
Sir?

791
00:45:54,362 --> 00:45:56,262
Shiva! Where are those guys, you
arrested for drinking and nuisance?

792
00:45:56,362 --> 00:45:58,528
They are inside.
One person is CBI.

793
00:45:58,570 --> 00:46:00,111
Just now I called and confirmed that.
-Alright…Alright.

794
00:46:00,153 --> 00:46:00,945
Are they inside?

795
00:46:14,737 --> 00:46:17,195
What SP you are here?

796
00:46:18,695 --> 00:46:19,570
Two minutes!

797
00:46:20,153 --> 00:46:21,237
Take your time.

798
00:46:22,528 --> 00:46:23,861
Sir I am a CBI officer.

799
00:46:23,945 --> 00:46:25,779
I have arrested him legally.

800
00:46:25,945 --> 00:46:27,095
I have given my chief’s number.

801
00:46:27,195 --> 00:46:28,695
Hello, did you speak with him?

802
00:46:28,903 --> 00:46:30,237
Hello?
-Cool! Calm down!

803
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,278
Don’t shout!

804
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,278
Are you from CBI?

805
00:46:32,861 --> 00:46:34,028
Yes!
-hmm.

806
00:46:34,903 --> 00:46:36,195
Please go and do it.

807
00:46:36,528 --> 00:46:37,903
Hey did you call and speak
with him?

808
00:46:37,945 --> 00:46:39,945
Hey, Rangappa!
-Sir?

809
00:46:39,986 --> 00:46:41,779
Send everyone out of here,
no one should stay.

810
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:43,153
Go!
-Okay sir.

811
00:46:43,487 --> 00:46:45,470
Hey! All of you go home.
-Okay sir.

812
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:46,720
Take him along and go home.
-Sir!

813
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:48,403
Sir, one man is a CBI.

814
00:46:48,487 --> 00:46:49,945
I spoke with his chief.

815
00:46:50,028 --> 00:46:51,403
Hey, I know what to do.

816
00:46:51,612 --> 00:46:52,679
-First you leave this place.
-Sir!

817
00:46:52,779 --> 00:46:53,903
-First take him away.
-Sir!

818
00:46:53,945 --> 00:46:55,761
-Raju, leave the gun here.
-Sir, I spoke with his chief.

819
00:46:55,861 --> 00:46:57,779
Come on let’s go.
-Brother you go…

820
00:46:57,861 --> 00:46:59,487
SI has told us,
so come let’s leave.

821
00:46:59,654 --> 00:47:00,528
Come on.

822
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:02,403
Brother you go, I am telling
you, right? -Shiva…

823
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,053
This is high end business.

824
00:47:04,153 --> 00:47:05,512
Don’t get involved in
these matters.

825
00:47:05,612 --> 00:47:07,195
Do we need this?
Tell me?

826
00:47:07,237 --> 00:47:09,403
Come on let’s go.
Gopal sir, just a minute.

827
00:47:13,487 --> 00:47:14,820
Mukthar do you know the location?

828
00:47:14,861 --> 00:47:16,487
Yes sir,
I am calling from the location.

829
00:47:16,695 --> 00:47:18,695
Raju and the CBI officer,
both are here only.

830
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:20,445
What is this CBI guy
doing there?

831
00:47:20,528 --> 00:47:22,654
He has to speak
with his senior officer.

832
00:47:26,737 --> 00:47:28,028
You know what to do, right?

833
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:29,153
Yes sir, I know.

834
00:47:29,779 --> 00:47:31,387
Call me once the work is done.
-Okay sir.

835
00:47:31,487 --> 00:47:34,403
Don’t answer any phone calls.
-Rangappa, come here!

836
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:40,570
Sir, your medicnes!

837
00:47:42,028 --> 00:47:43,362
What?
-Sir, sir!

838
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:42,153
Hey!

839
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:47,986
Shiva!

840
00:48:52,445 --> 00:48:54,362
Why did you shoot me?

841
00:49:01,195 --> 00:49:02,528
Hey, catch him!

842
00:49:11,654 --> 00:49:12,570
Hey!

843
00:50:29,403 --> 00:50:30,237
Hey!

844
00:50:47,028 --> 00:50:47,861
Hey!

845
00:51:02,070 --> 00:51:03,528
Shiva! Hey, Shiva!

846
00:51:04,362 --> 00:51:05,403
Wait Shiva!

847
00:51:05,695 --> 00:51:06,612
Shiva!!

848
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:14,986
You are making a very big
mistake, Shiva!

849
00:51:15,111 --> 00:51:16,779
What you are doing is wrong, sir.
-Shiva! Shiva!

850
00:51:16,861 --> 00:51:17,945
Shiva!

851
00:51:30,695 --> 00:51:31,654
Hey, Shiva!

852
00:51:32,695 --> 00:51:33,945
Stop there! Catch him!

853
00:51:39,861 --> 00:51:40,737
Hey!

854
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:43,695
Shiva, come here!

855
00:51:44,445 --> 00:51:45,487
-Hold him.
-Sir?

856
00:51:45,903 --> 00:51:47,195
Come!
-Yes sir, I am coming.

857
00:51:47,654 --> 00:51:49,362
Lift him up.
Come on.

858
00:51:50,237 --> 00:51:51,945
We have to take him to
the hospital. Come on.

859
00:51:52,278 --> 00:51:53,195
Let’s go!

860
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:55,070
You only shot me you fool!

861
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:56,612
I fired by mistake sir.

862
00:51:56,903 --> 00:51:58,403
Hey Shiva, pick up the gun.

863
00:51:59,028 --> 00:51:59,695
Come.

864
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:02,403
Shiva come quickly.

865
00:52:03,362 --> 00:52:04,612
Come.
-Hey!

866
00:52:06,445 --> 00:52:07,570
Lock it Shiva!

867
00:52:08,153 --> 00:52:09,570
Come, come quickly.

868
00:52:10,403 --> 00:52:12,111
We are running out of time.
Come on Shiva!

869
00:52:15,362 --> 00:52:16,237
Dear!

870
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:18,320
Ask them plans for the honeymoon?

871
00:52:18,779 --> 00:52:20,153
Marriage will be done.

872
00:52:20,403 --> 00:52:21,612
Shall we send to Kashmir.

873
00:52:21,737 --> 00:52:23,095
Son in law has the passport, right?

874
00:52:23,195 --> 00:52:25,720
Yes brother, he has passport,
VISA and everything.

875
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:26,695
Hi!

876
00:52:27,362 --> 00:52:28,945
Hi!
-She’s my only sister.

877
00:52:29,070 --> 00:52:30,945
I got to get her married.

878
00:52:31,362 --> 00:52:34,861
I have to speak with you.
-Oh, I see!

879
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:38,570
Naughty!

880
00:52:38,737 --> 00:52:41,070
No…No!
I want to speak with you.

881
00:52:41,528 --> 00:52:43,028
Speak?
-Yes.

882
00:52:43,528 --> 00:52:44,445
Now?

883
00:52:44,570 --> 00:52:45,403
Yes now.

884
00:52:45,487 --> 00:52:46,737
Okay.

885
00:52:47,779 --> 00:52:49,237
Come over there.

886
00:52:49,737 --> 00:52:51,028
Okay I will be there.

887
00:52:51,403 --> 00:52:52,320
Okay, bye.

888
00:52:52,903 --> 00:52:55,070
Revathi is my love.

889
00:53:03,612 --> 00:53:05,695
Hey buddy, its time.
Where is the bottle?

890
00:53:05,737 --> 00:53:07,820
Bottle is there only. Go drink
and become useless like Premji.

891
00:53:07,903 --> 00:53:08,654
Okay, okay.

892
00:53:21,861 --> 00:53:24,487
Dear, can you…
do me a small favour?

893
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,570
Can you take me to the place
where I want to?

894
00:53:28,237 --> 00:53:31,237
[Whispering]

895
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:33,153
What?

896
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:35,195
Only air is coming out of
my mouth.

897
00:53:36,945 --> 00:53:38,320
So cute!!

898
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:25,986
What happened?

899
00:54:27,070 --> 00:54:27,903
Sir?

900
00:54:28,403 --> 00:54:29,737
Did Raju’s men come here?

901
00:54:29,945 --> 00:54:31,487
No, sir! One man!

902
00:54:31,986 --> 00:54:32,820
One man?

903
00:54:33,195 --> 00:54:34,861
A constable from this station, sir.

904
00:54:35,487 --> 00:54:36,820
A constable of the station?

905
00:54:36,903 --> 00:54:38,445
What were you all doing then?

906
00:54:43,153 --> 00:54:44,195
Do you have his photo?

907
00:54:50,528 --> 00:54:51,262
Look!
-Dad?

908
00:54:51,362 --> 00:54:52,612
You need not give any money…

909
00:54:53,903 --> 00:54:54,861
Hey Shiva,

910
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:56,986
what are you doing
here, at this time?

911
00:55:07,612 --> 00:55:08,695
Hey!

912
00:55:09,278 --> 00:55:10,695
Where have you brought me?

913
00:55:10,737 --> 00:55:11,737
Dad, be careful.

914
00:55:15,362 --> 00:55:17,445
Please come and take a look.
-Please come!

915
00:55:21,362 --> 00:55:22,195
Hey!

916
00:55:22,612 --> 00:55:24,111
Are you a doctor?
-No!

917
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:26,403
I am a mortuary van driver.
-Mortuary van?

918
00:55:27,362 --> 00:55:29,111
What are you trying to do to me?
-You wait, man.

919
00:55:29,195 --> 00:55:31,362
First aid must be done
to stop the bleeding.

920
00:55:31,528 --> 00:55:32,612
You carry on sir.
-Okay.

921
00:55:32,695 --> 00:55:34,153
Yo! Do you know how to do this?

922
00:55:34,362 --> 00:55:36,237
Yo! You just turn to that side.

923
00:55:42,362 --> 00:55:43,779
Sir, there will be
no bleeding, right?

924
00:55:43,986 --> 00:55:46,237
For now, there will not be any issue.
But take him fast. -Okay!

925
00:55:46,528 --> 00:55:48,070
-Okay dad, I shall leave then.
-Okay you take care.

926
00:55:48,111 --> 00:55:49,570
Dad? Hey!

927
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:51,362
Is this your son?

928
00:55:51,528 --> 00:55:53,945
He is taking a huge risk by
siding with the CBI.

929
00:55:54,487 --> 00:55:55,695
They will kill him for sure.

930
00:55:56,028 --> 00:55:57,445
Listen to me.
Tell him to let me go.

931
00:55:57,654 --> 00:55:58,445
Tell him now.

932
00:55:58,528 --> 00:56:00,237
Shiva, it is risky
to travel in this vehicle.

933
00:56:00,445 --> 00:56:01,654
Can you find something else?

934
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:03,111
Shiva, you take our vehicle.

935
00:56:03,278 --> 00:56:04,861
There will be problem if you go
in that vehicle.

936
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:07,387
No matter what, just hand him
over at the right place.

937
00:56:07,487 --> 00:56:09,195
Hey, hey! What is happening here?

938
00:56:09,861 --> 00:56:12,111
The policeman is very loyal.
CBI guy is very loyal.

939
00:56:12,362 --> 00:56:14,320
Even a mortuary driver is
at most loyal. -Shiva…

940
00:56:14,654 --> 00:56:16,403
There is a bad vibration
around me.

941
00:56:16,945 --> 00:56:18,820
You cannot even cross
the district border.

942
00:56:18,945 --> 00:56:20,153
They will kill the three of us.

943
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:22,654
Then you have to carry your
son’s body in your vehicle.

944
00:56:23,070 --> 00:56:23,945
Hey!!

945
00:56:24,153 --> 00:56:26,362
One smack and you’ll die
then and there.

946
00:56:26,986 --> 00:56:29,053
I am used to seeing corpses
every day.

947
00:56:29,153 --> 00:56:30,278
Sir, you please go.

948
00:56:30,612 --> 00:56:31,570
Old man,
-Dad, come!

949
00:56:31,779 --> 00:56:33,320
why are you becoming furious?
-Come!

950
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:34,903
I got scared.

951
00:56:35,861 --> 00:56:36,986
Dad,
-Ah?

952
00:56:37,695 --> 00:56:39,362
police will come to our
house, searching for me.

953
00:56:40,737 --> 00:56:43,445
You take mom and sister
and go out of station.

954
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:47,237
I shall take care of that.

955
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:48,570
You go now…

956
00:56:50,445 --> 00:56:51,403
and be careful.

957
00:57:06,111 --> 00:57:07,111
Where are we going?

958
00:57:07,362 --> 00:57:08,487
To meet Shiva.
-Huh?

959
00:57:08,861 --> 00:57:09,861
Shiva?

960
00:57:10,237 --> 00:57:11,153
Yes.

961
00:57:11,861 --> 00:57:15,237
I have to meet him
and ask him a few questions.

962
00:57:16,111 --> 00:57:17,111
That’s it?

963
00:57:17,654 --> 00:57:18,654
Not only that.

964
00:57:19,111 --> 00:57:21,320
You have to thrash him for good.

965
00:57:21,945 --> 00:57:22,861
Really?

966
00:57:23,403 --> 00:57:24,362
I swear.

967
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:26,945
It’s been many years.

968
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:28,761
Since you fought with someone?

969
00:57:28,861 --> 00:57:30,445
Ah! Since I fought with
a single person.

970
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:34,028
Normally when I fight there
will be 40-50 fighters around.

971
00:57:34,153 --> 00:57:35,695
I would punch and strike them.

972
00:57:36,070 --> 00:57:38,945
But for you and only this
one time, I shall hit this one guy.

973
00:57:39,945 --> 00:57:40,761
I’m so lucky.

974
00:57:40,861 --> 00:57:41,612
Yes!

975
00:57:42,111 --> 00:57:44,487
Come on baby,
let’s go on the bullet.

976
00:57:46,654 --> 00:57:48,153
Did you compose this yourself?

977
00:57:48,278 --> 00:57:50,487
This sounds very familiar.
-Yeah, I composed this just now.

978
00:57:50,737 --> 00:57:51,970
-This is my own tune.
-It is very nice.

979
00:57:52,070 --> 00:57:54,095
Even in the future, I can become
a great musician in some great movie.

980
00:57:54,195 --> 00:57:54,945
Yeah, definitely.

981
00:57:57,250 --> 00:57:58,542
Hey! CBI,

982
00:57:59,542 --> 00:58:02,291
you work with Central Government,
whereas I work with the State Government.

983
00:58:03,667 --> 00:58:05,333
You are legal and I am illegal.

984
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,667
But our jobs are almost similar.

985
00:58:07,875 --> 00:58:10,708
Hey! I don’t work
for politicians like you do.

986
00:58:11,291 --> 00:58:12,250
Ah?

987
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,250
Calculate well,

988
00:58:14,542 --> 00:58:16,084
you too are working for politicians.

989
00:58:16,667 --> 00:58:17,859
You aren’t aware of that.
That’s it.

990
00:58:17,959 --> 00:58:19,733
Come on baby let’s go on
the bullet.

991
00:58:19,833 --> 00:58:21,166
Hey Shiva!

992
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:23,625
Revathi!

993
00:58:24,917 --> 00:58:26,542
Why has he stopped suddenly?
-What happened?

994
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:27,817
I think he understood what
I said.

995
00:58:27,917 --> 00:58:29,316
-Sir! Just a minute.
-Why did you stop?

996
00:58:29,416 --> 00:58:31,583
-Sir, please just one minute.
-What one minute?

997
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:32,708
Goodbye, brother.

998
00:58:32,792 --> 00:58:34,333
-Shiva, where are you going?
-At least, release me and then go.

999
00:58:34,375 --> 00:58:35,667
Shut up! Shiva?

1000
00:58:35,917 --> 00:58:37,442
Hey! Revathi! But where
are you going at this hour?

1001
00:58:37,542 --> 00:58:39,667
I asked you to come and take
me away. Why didn’t you?

1002
00:58:39,875 --> 00:58:41,959
Please, listen to what I say.

1003
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,250
I have heard that a lot.

1004
00:58:43,833 --> 00:58:45,833
But where are you going at
this time? -Hey!

1005
00:58:45,875 --> 00:58:47,917
I should ask that to you?
Where are you going at this time?

1006
00:58:48,084 --> 00:58:50,208
That too with him. Huh?
-Oh! That?

1007
00:58:50,375 --> 00:58:51,775
I have eloped from my house.

1008
00:58:51,875 --> 00:58:52,859
Eloped?
-That’s fine…

1009
00:58:52,959 --> 00:58:54,959
Shiva, there is no time,
come fast.

1010
00:58:55,042 --> 00:58:56,333
Yes sir. I am coming.
-Hey!

1011
00:58:56,375 --> 00:58:57,500
Even we don’t have time.
-Hey!

1012
00:58:57,583 --> 00:58:59,500
He is a CBI officer.
Talk with some respect.

1013
00:58:59,792 --> 00:59:01,567
Sorry sir, even we don’t have time.
-CBI officer?

1014
00:59:01,667 --> 00:59:03,208
I have given him the due respect.
Is that enough?

1015
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:04,650
There is a huge mess involving
CBI and police.

1016
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:06,583
I am in an even greater mess.

1017
00:59:06,792 --> 00:59:08,542
They are asking me to get married to
this Idiot, tomorrow morning at Thirupathi.

1018
00:59:08,625 --> 00:59:10,250
Yes my marriage.
-Shall I marry him?

1019
00:59:10,333 --> 00:59:11,833
-You tell me. Shall I marry him?
-My marriage.

1020
00:59:12,583 --> 00:59:13,375
Tell me.

1021
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:17,084
Alright, now…Sir!
-Shiva, time is running out, come fast.

1022
00:59:17,458 --> 00:59:18,291
Come now.

1023
00:59:18,333 --> 00:59:19,166
Tell me.

1024
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:21,166
You come with me now.
Come on.

1025
00:59:21,542 --> 00:59:23,500
Hey…Shiva….Revathi…

1026
00:59:25,291 --> 00:59:26,333
Fight scene.

1027
00:59:27,959 --> 00:59:29,375
Shiva, who is this?

1028
00:59:29,416 --> 00:59:30,625
Who is this new addition?

1029
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:31,959
My lover sir.
-Lover?

1030
00:59:32,333 --> 00:59:33,792
Yes, sir!
-Lover?

1031
00:59:34,042 --> 00:59:36,208
A small problem at her house.
So we eloped.

1032
00:59:37,333 --> 00:59:38,333
Hi sir.

1033
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:41,250
Oh my…

1034
00:59:41,667 --> 00:59:43,291
Uncle?
-Son-in-law, where are you?

1035
00:59:43,375 --> 00:59:44,483
There has been a huge mistake.

1036
00:59:44,583 --> 00:59:46,333
Uncle… oh my!!
My girl is missing.

1037
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:48,333
Girl is missing?

1038
00:59:48,583 --> 00:59:50,667
Yes son-in-law, my daughter Revathi.
-What are you saying?

1039
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:51,984
I can’t believe this!

1040
00:59:52,084 --> 00:59:53,542
We have to somehow find her.

1041
00:59:53,583 --> 00:59:55,125
We will find her.
-Coming, uncle!

1042
00:59:56,333 --> 00:59:57,166
Revathi!

1043
00:59:58,500 --> 00:59:59,500
Hey!

1044
00:59:59,542 --> 01:00:01,442
A girl has come trusting you, but you
are trusting him and taking me along.

1045
01:00:01,542 --> 01:00:02,500
Let me go my way.

1046
01:00:02,959 --> 01:00:04,959
You both go and be happy somewhere.

1047
01:00:05,084 --> 01:00:06,125
Well said brother!

1048
01:00:06,667 --> 01:00:08,667
A criminal, you could
understand the situation.

1049
01:00:08,959 --> 01:00:10,708
But this policeman cannot.

1050
01:00:11,625 --> 01:00:13,084
Revathi, keep quiet.

1051
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:16,500
Revathi!

1052
01:00:17,166 --> 01:00:18,333
How many years of love?

1053
01:00:18,875 --> 01:00:21,208
Brother, we are in love since
our school days.

1054
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:22,542
Ah?
-Hmm.

1055
01:00:22,833 --> 01:00:23,567
Yes.

1056
01:00:23,667 --> 01:00:25,166
Since your school days?

1057
01:00:25,875 --> 01:00:27,542
Before we reach our destination,
they will kill you guys.

1058
01:00:27,583 --> 01:00:28,917
I am saddened
when I think about that.

1059
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:30,625
Ah? Kill us?

1060
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:33,084
Don’t you know?

1061
01:00:34,208 --> 01:00:37,458
Your guy has beaten DSP, SP,
vandalised police station, and taken me,

1062
01:00:37,625 --> 01:00:39,583
just because of what this guy said.

1063
01:00:40,125 --> 01:00:41,500
SP and DSP?

1064
01:00:41,667 --> 01:00:43,208
You don’t even know this guy.

1065
01:00:43,375 --> 01:00:45,708
How could you beat SP and DSP
for him?

1066
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:48,250
We are in love since our childhood.

1067
01:00:48,583 --> 01:00:50,833
You could’ve beaten my father
once and taken me, right?

1068
01:00:50,959 --> 01:00:52,400
Sister you give me the address.

1069
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:53,792
I shall deal with your father.

1070
01:00:53,959 --> 01:00:55,792
Don’t talk without knowing anything.

1071
01:00:56,208 --> 01:00:58,316
Will we die before our marriage?

1072
01:00:58,416 --> 01:01:00,125
Girl, can you keep quiet for
some time?

1073
01:01:01,416 --> 01:01:04,542
After we handover him,
I will get you both married.

1074
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:06,125
-Really?
-Yes.

1075
01:01:06,208 --> 01:01:07,542
You? Let’s see!

1076
01:01:08,208 --> 01:01:10,000
Are you married in the first place,
you fool?

1077
01:01:10,084 --> 01:01:10,917
Listen,

1078
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:15,166
in a little while, my men will come here.
They will kill you all and take me away.

1079
01:01:15,917 --> 01:01:18,375
Hey! You called me as brother
without even seeing my face.

1080
01:01:19,875 --> 01:01:21,416
I feel so sorry for you.

1081
01:01:22,667 --> 01:01:23,833
Anyway sister,

1082
01:01:24,792 --> 01:01:25,833
rest in peace.

1083
01:01:26,208 --> 01:01:27,542
What are you saying?

1084
01:01:27,708 --> 01:01:29,291
Hey he is just trying to scare you.

1085
01:01:29,583 --> 01:01:30,400
You keep quiet.

1086
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:31,733
Tell me if you are scared.

1087
01:01:31,833 --> 01:01:33,625
I shall stop the vehicle and
you can go your way.

1088
01:01:33,833 --> 01:01:34,917
No, No, No

1089
01:01:35,291 --> 01:01:37,458
Instead of marrying him and
living with him,

1090
01:01:37,667 --> 01:01:38,608
I can very well die here with you.

1091
01:01:38,708 --> 01:01:40,166
Bad choice sister!

1092
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,250
CBI is taking Raju to
the Bangalore court.

1093
01:02:02,458 --> 01:02:04,275
Ask them to check all
the vehicles in that route.

1094
01:02:04,375 --> 01:02:06,166
Definitely he will not go in
a police jeep.

1095
01:02:06,375 --> 01:02:08,959
Because he will know that we would
have informed all the police stations.

1096
01:02:09,166 --> 01:02:11,416
Arrange for check posts in
every district border.

1097
01:02:11,792 --> 01:02:14,750
Ask them to check every
public transportation areas.

1098
01:02:15,333 --> 01:02:17,750
Since Raju is injured, he will
definitely take him to the hospital.

1099
01:02:18,042 --> 01:02:19,250
Check all the hospitals.

1100
01:02:19,333 --> 01:02:22,375
Stop every suspicious vehicle
and inform to me at once.

1101
01:02:22,583 --> 01:02:23,500
Sir?
-Yes?

1102
01:02:23,583 --> 01:02:24,608
We enquired at his house.

1103
01:02:24,708 --> 01:02:26,667
They say that his parents have
escaped about 2 hours ago.

1104
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:29,291
Won’t a policeman know that?

1105
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:31,792
Enquire all his friends
and relatives.

1106
01:02:31,959 --> 01:02:33,333
He should not cross this district.

1107
01:02:33,542 --> 01:02:36,500
Sir, he has no relatives except
an uncle. He too has absconded.

1108
01:02:36,750 --> 01:02:39,291
We also enquired at the hospital where
his father works. But no information.

1109
01:02:39,333 --> 01:02:40,817
Why aren’t you allowing me inside?

1110
01:02:40,917 --> 01:02:42,500
I am an ex-councillor.

1111
01:02:42,667 --> 01:02:44,084
SI Rangappa is my relative.

1112
01:02:44,208 --> 01:02:45,875
Hey! Who is that?
-Let me in.

1113
01:02:46,084 --> 01:02:47,125
I have to meet the SI.

1114
01:02:47,291 --> 01:02:49,108
Tell him that Ramamurthy is here.
-Rangappa, come here.

1115
01:02:49,208 --> 01:02:51,166
What is happening here?
Why are you shouting here?

1116
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:53,250
-Where is that Shiva?
-He is not here.

1117
01:02:53,333 --> 01:02:54,608
He has kidnapped my daughter.

1118
01:02:54,708 --> 01:02:56,817
File a case against him and
write an FIR.

1119
01:02:56,917 --> 01:02:58,483
Ramamurthy, this is another issue.

1120
01:02:58,583 --> 01:02:59,708
Revathi is not with him.

1121
01:03:00,583 --> 01:03:02,125
Son-in-law, come here.
Come here.

1122
01:03:02,375 --> 01:03:04,291
-Uncle?
-Come here! Tell him.

1123
01:03:04,667 --> 01:03:05,875
What should I tell him?

1124
01:03:05,959 --> 01:03:07,333
Tell him what happened.

1125
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:08,583
Okay ready.

1126
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:12,542
Constable Shiva, works in your
station has taken my Revathi.

1127
01:03:12,583 --> 01:03:14,333
What is your problem?
-Oh my, son-in-law!

1128
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:16,583
It’s me sir.
It was me sir.

1129
01:03:16,667 --> 01:03:17,708
What are you saying?

1130
01:03:18,959 --> 01:03:20,042
Let me adjust my wig.

1131
01:03:20,583 --> 01:03:22,959
I am in love with Revathi
since my childhood.

1132
01:03:23,208 --> 01:03:25,750
Even after knowing that they both are
in love, I am still in love with her.

1133
01:03:25,917 --> 01:03:27,416
My love is so sincere.

1134
01:03:27,583 --> 01:03:30,792
My uncle fixed our wedding to be
conducted today morning at Thirupathi.

1135
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,250
Yesterday night, she signalled
and called me.

1136
01:03:33,416 --> 01:03:34,333
Son-in-law?

1137
01:03:34,416 --> 01:03:35,792
I too thought the same thing.

1138
01:03:35,917 --> 01:03:37,625
And that is why I went with her.
But nothing happened.

1139
01:03:37,833 --> 01:03:39,542
Nothing happened sir.
Nothing happened at all.

1140
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:43,542
She said that she wanted to give
him her peace of mind.

1141
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:46,042
I believed her and we went in
my vehicle.

1142
01:03:46,250 --> 01:03:49,416
He came, while we were
crossing that Palem Bridge.

1143
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:52,166
He came, stood, spoke
and they escaped.

1144
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:54,400
He came, stood, spoke
and they escaped.

1145
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:57,042
My Revathi, who has to live as my bride,
went along with him like a corpse.

1146
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:00,792
No, she got into that mortuary van,

1147
01:04:00,875 --> 01:04:02,942
and she eloped with him,
right in front of my eyes.

1148
01:04:03,042 --> 01:04:03,833
She left.

1149
01:04:03,875 --> 01:04:06,708
Sir, his father is a mortuary van
driver at the Government hospital.

1150
01:04:07,667 --> 01:04:08,583
Hey?

1151
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:10,416
Who else was there in that van?

1152
01:04:12,458 --> 01:04:14,625
Sir, only wind is coming out of
my mouth. -Fool!

1153
01:04:15,542 --> 01:04:16,375
This wig is a nuisance.

1154
01:04:16,416 --> 01:04:18,084
Trace that mortuary van’s location.

1155
01:04:18,125 --> 01:04:19,500
They should not leave this town.

1156
01:04:19,959 --> 01:04:21,291
-Alert all the check posts.
-Okay sir.

1157
01:04:27,667 --> 01:04:29,458
What happened now?
-Sir, the radiator is all heated up.

1158
01:04:29,583 --> 01:04:31,291
We need to pour water.
I shall go and check.

1159
01:04:31,416 --> 01:04:32,625
Okay go and come fast.

1160
01:04:32,667 --> 01:04:34,333
Hey come slowly.

1161
01:04:34,542 --> 01:04:36,166
Hey! He is a big headache!

1162
01:04:36,375 --> 01:04:37,166
Go now.

1163
01:04:40,667 --> 01:04:42,084
Natraj sir! Please respond, over!

1164
01:04:42,625 --> 01:04:43,833
Tell me, which place?

1165
01:04:43,875 --> 01:04:46,416
Go the information that they are
going in a Mortury van that way.

1166
01:04:46,458 --> 01:04:47,208
Over!

1167
01:04:54,625 --> 01:04:55,733
Brother, I shall take some water.

1168
01:04:55,833 --> 01:04:57,625
The radiator has heated up.
-Okay, take it!

1169
01:04:57,917 --> 01:05:00,208
Hey! Shiva, long time no see?

1170
01:05:00,625 --> 01:05:03,500
Heard some criminal has escaped?
Have they sent you to catch him?

1171
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:04,667
No sir,

1172
01:05:04,875 --> 01:05:07,291
the radiator of the vehicle has
heated up. I came to get some water.

1173
01:05:07,458 --> 01:05:08,917
Why are you using dad’s vehicle?

1174
01:05:09,125 --> 01:05:11,483
Jeep has broken down and that is
why I came in my dad’s vehicle.

1175
01:05:11,583 --> 01:05:13,500
Constable Shiva from Sakinetipalli Police
Station, has escaped along with an accused.

1176
01:05:13,583 --> 01:05:15,442
It is an order to inform about
their whereabouts if they are found.

1177
01:05:15,542 --> 01:05:16,084
I repeat!

1178
01:05:16,125 --> 01:05:18,567
Constable Shiva from Sakinetipalli Police
Station, has escaped along with an accused.

1179
01:05:18,667 --> 01:05:20,833
What’s this Shiva!
-Sir, Sir, no sir.

1180
01:05:21,166 --> 01:05:23,042
-Shiva, surrender!
-Sir! No, sir. Let go!

1181
01:05:30,792 --> 01:05:31,833
Don’t move, wait!

1182
01:05:48,208 --> 01:05:49,583
Shiva, come fast.

1183
01:05:50,125 --> 01:05:51,084
Is it over?

1184
01:05:51,333 --> 01:05:52,458
Sir the police have come.

1185
01:05:53,792 --> 01:05:54,959
Start the vehicle, fast.

1186
01:05:56,458 --> 01:05:57,066
Shiva!

1187
01:05:57,166 --> 01:05:59,166
I think he has poured the water
into the petrol tank.

1188
01:05:59,208 --> 01:06:00,458
They are closing in on us.

1189
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:02,542
Go Shiva.

1190
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:03,959
Shiva! Go…Go…

1191
01:06:17,084 --> 01:06:18,667
Shiva, there is a vehicle to
your left.

1192
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:23,667
Shiva are you okay?

1193
01:06:24,208 --> 01:06:25,000
Go.

1194
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:45,416
Block the bridge road.

1195
01:06:45,708 --> 01:06:46,750
Block them.

1196
01:06:54,583 --> 01:06:56,333
Hey, Shiva! Fast, fast!

1197
01:06:56,542 --> 01:06:57,583
Hey, Shiva!

1198
01:07:01,416 --> 01:07:02,416
Move it, move it!

1199
01:07:10,416 --> 01:07:11,291
Shiva!

1200
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,708
What are you doing?
Leave it.

1201
01:07:15,833 --> 01:07:17,000
Brother, leave me.

1202
01:07:17,416 --> 01:07:18,291
Hey leave her.

1203
01:07:18,583 --> 01:07:20,917
Hey Shiva, you drive properly!
-Hey Raju, leave her.

1204
01:07:21,333 --> 01:07:22,667
Hey Raju leave her.

1205
01:07:22,833 --> 01:07:24,375
Hey, you look ahead.
-Hey Raju, leave her.

1206
01:07:24,416 --> 01:07:26,125
-Hey, Raju!
-Be careful.

1207
01:08:32,375 --> 01:08:33,458
Go that side.

1208
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:38,583
Check if there is a way that side.

1209
01:08:40,750 --> 01:08:41,750
You go to this side.

1210
01:08:41,917 --> 01:08:42,792
Partner!

1211
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:45,667
Partner!

1212
01:08:47,416 --> 01:08:48,667
It is Razu, partner!

1213
01:08:51,250 --> 01:08:52,208
Razu!

1214
01:08:52,708 --> 01:08:53,792
Sorry my friend.

1215
01:09:33,250 --> 01:09:34,667
Sir, this way!

1216
01:09:50,917 --> 01:09:52,000
Sir, what are you doing?

1217
01:09:52,125 --> 01:09:52,875
Sir?

1218
01:09:53,583 --> 01:09:55,833
Sir…sir, what are you doing?

1219
01:09:55,875 --> 01:09:56,833
Please open the door.

1220
01:09:57,542 --> 01:09:59,750
I have been hit by a bullet. It is
useless for me to come all the way.

1221
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,625
Sir, open the lock.
-Listen to what I say.

1222
01:10:01,667 --> 01:10:03,042
Listen to me, please!
-Listen!

1223
01:10:03,917 --> 01:10:05,692
Submit him at the Bangalore Court.
-What are you saying, sir?

1224
01:10:05,792 --> 01:10:07,542
Go Shiva.
How can we abandon you at
this condition?

1225
01:10:09,166 --> 01:10:10,625
Sir, please come with us.
-Hey!

1226
01:10:10,917 --> 01:10:13,625
If you were hit by a bullet,
I wouldn’t have thought like you.

1227
01:10:13,750 --> 01:10:16,333
Sir? Please open the door and come.
-I am a waste luggage Shiva.

1228
01:10:16,416 --> 01:10:17,917
There is no time, you go.

1229
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,358
Listen to me sir.
Open the door and come inside.

1230
01:10:19,458 --> 01:10:21,042
-I cannot leave you here.
-Go…Go…Shiva!

1231
01:10:21,333 --> 01:10:23,750
Shiva, take him there. Don’t
talk and waste the time now.

1232
01:10:23,833 --> 01:10:25,692
They are coming here!
I shall take care.

1233
01:10:25,792 --> 01:10:26,959
-Go!
-Shiva! Come on.

1234
01:11:45,667 --> 01:11:46,667
Raju!!

1235
01:11:48,750 --> 01:11:49,917
My dear friend!

1236
01:11:53,959 --> 01:11:55,042
Can you hear me?

1237
01:11:55,416 --> 01:11:56,458
Raju, Raju!

1238
01:11:57,333 --> 01:11:58,792
Stay inside. Stay inside.

1239
01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:00,166
Hide inside

1240
01:12:00,291 --> 01:12:01,416
You were once a terror,

1241
01:12:01,833 --> 01:12:03,917
but now you are cowering
into a small lane.

1242
01:12:05,166 --> 01:12:06,500
How many times did I tell you?

1243
01:12:06,875 --> 01:12:09,000
Not to roam around and not to
go beyond jurisdiction limit?

1244
01:12:09,125 --> 01:12:10,042
What happened now?

1245
01:12:10,166 --> 01:12:11,583
You have been caught by the CBI.

1246
01:12:12,917 --> 01:12:16,166
How many murders
have we done together?

1247
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:19,042
-But I am in a position to kill you.
-Hey, Raju! Stay here!

1248
01:12:19,208 --> 01:12:20,125
Wait, please!

1249
01:12:20,166 --> 01:12:21,084
What can I do?

1250
01:12:22,792 --> 01:12:24,333
It is the order from
the high command.

1251
01:12:25,708 --> 01:12:27,042
Raju!
-No! Raju, no!

1252
01:12:27,458 --> 01:12:28,833
What a great man you are!

1253
01:12:30,291 --> 01:12:31,667
You are frightened of me...

1254
01:12:32,333 --> 01:12:34,042
and hiding behind a meek constable.

1255
01:12:35,625 --> 01:12:37,458
How will your frightened face be?

1256
01:12:37,875 --> 01:12:39,291
I want to see your face.

1257
01:12:40,917 --> 01:12:41,875
Raju!

1258
01:12:42,542 --> 01:12:43,792
I’m here!

1259
01:12:45,708 --> 01:12:46,708
Come!

1260
01:12:54,125 --> 01:12:55,542
Raju…

1261
01:12:56,458 --> 01:12:57,500
It is not Raju…

1262
01:12:58,291 --> 01:12:59,458
Razu!!

1263
01:13:01,042 --> 01:13:02,875
Don’t I know that partner?
-Hey Raju!

1264
01:13:06,250 --> 01:13:08,583
Hey, no…no!

1265
01:13:14,042 --> 01:13:15,500
-Hey Raju!
-It is Raju!!

1266
01:13:15,583 --> 01:13:17,125
Hey Raju, listen.
Don't go, stop.

1267
01:13:21,875 --> 01:13:24,291
Sir, leave! Listen to me.
Leave, sir!

1268
01:13:26,166 --> 01:13:27,125
Hey!

1269
01:14:42,875 --> 01:14:44,042
Hey, leave idiot!

1270
01:16:45,809 --> 01:16:52,809
-Hail! CM!
-Hail! CM!

1271
01:16:53,475 --> 01:16:54,725
Greetings!
-Greetings!

1272
01:16:54,850 --> 01:16:56,392
Greetings!
-Greetings!

1273
01:16:56,517 --> 01:16:57,667
Greetings! Please come!

1274
01:16:57,767 --> 01:16:59,350
Sir, is upstairs!
-Okay.

1275
01:17:10,266 --> 01:17:11,392
[clearing throat]

1276
01:17:12,725 --> 01:17:13,683
Good day uncle.

1277
01:17:14,934 --> 01:17:16,016
Ah! Come dear.

1278
01:17:16,225 --> 01:17:17,517
-Did you eat?
Yes.

1279
01:17:18,475 --> 01:17:20,809
Are your problems over?

1280
01:17:21,642 --> 01:17:22,725
It will be over soon.

1281
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:24,433
You know everything.

1282
01:17:25,475 --> 01:17:28,975
Your father and I strived hard
to form this party.

1283
01:17:29,517 --> 01:17:34,266
When times were hard for a regional
party, to win over a national party,

1284
01:17:34,558 --> 01:17:36,850
We started this party for
the people.

1285
01:17:37,308 --> 01:17:38,934
The trust on your father…

1286
01:17:39,767 --> 01:17:41,809
and the sympathy wave due to
his death,

1287
01:17:42,809 --> 01:17:44,642
All these have made you
a CM today.

1288
01:17:46,225 --> 01:17:47,767
People have accepted you.

1289
01:17:48,517 --> 01:17:51,767
But owing to your past mistakes,

1290
01:17:52,266 --> 01:17:57,517
People in the centre are trying
to destroy this party, with the CBI.

1291
01:17:58,475 --> 01:17:59,683
Don’t you worry uncle.

1292
01:18:00,058 --> 01:18:02,517
I shall prove my innocence in
the court and come out.

1293
01:18:02,642 --> 01:18:03,642
What?

1294
01:18:04,517 --> 01:18:06,475
They have your entire history
in their hands.

1295
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:09,558
It is the report that they have been
collecting for the past four years.

1296
01:18:09,767 --> 01:18:10,767
Uncle…

1297
01:18:11,433 --> 01:18:12,809
that will never help them.

1298
01:18:13,517 --> 01:18:15,433
The court needs evidence.
-Really?

1299
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:18,225
What is that guy’s name?
Raju, is it?

1300
01:18:18,683 --> 01:18:19,600
He will not come.

1301
01:18:20,392 --> 01:18:23,475
In the next 24 hours, he will
be wiped off this face of earth.

1302
01:18:24,058 --> 01:18:25,433
Don’t mistake me,

1303
01:18:26,475 --> 01:18:30,225
We would have no qualms
if you ended up in some trouble.

1304
01:18:30,433 --> 01:18:32,892
But if it is going to threaten
the party…

1305
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:34,100
I am aware of that.

1306
01:18:34,767 --> 01:18:35,975
Party is my priority too.

1307
01:18:37,433 --> 01:18:39,141
I shall meet you tomorrow
after the court.

1308
01:18:39,767 --> 01:18:40,683
Then…

1309
01:18:41,683 --> 01:18:43,225
Elections are approaching.

1310
01:18:44,683 --> 01:18:47,892
Don’t put us in a situation to
select another candidate for CM.

1311
01:18:51,517 --> 01:18:52,850
Greetings!
-Greetings!

1312
01:18:52,934 --> 01:18:58,934
-Hail! CM!
-Hail! CM!

1313
01:18:59,642 --> 01:19:00,892
What is happening Natraj?

1314
01:19:01,392 --> 01:19:04,016
I have killed that CBI officer,
madam.

1315
01:19:04,350 --> 01:19:08,683
But Raju has escaped
with that constable Shiva.

1316
01:19:08,975 --> 01:19:10,725
Damn! Aren’t you ashamed to
say this?

1317
01:19:12,058 --> 01:19:13,683
We are running out of time Natraj.

1318
01:19:14,183 --> 01:19:17,058
If Raju gets captured,
then you and I,

1319
01:19:17,266 --> 01:19:18,558
we all would be in trouble.

1320
01:19:18,767 --> 01:19:20,141
You have till tonight.

1321
01:19:20,308 --> 01:19:22,141
Mobilize the entire Police
Department if you need.

1322
01:19:22,266 --> 01:19:23,308
Do anything you need to.

1323
01:19:23,517 --> 01:19:24,642
If you need more,

1324
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:27,809
then make use of rowdies
and the party people.

1325
01:19:28,725 --> 01:19:31,767
I want Raju dead, today!

1326
01:19:50,934 --> 01:19:54,558
Please be cautious with the gun
otherwise it will fire!

1327
01:19:56,725 --> 01:19:57,809
Is it possible Shiva?

1328
01:19:58,350 --> 01:20:00,225
Can we go across all these people?

1329
01:20:01,058 --> 01:20:02,141
We can, come!

1330
01:20:03,809 --> 01:20:04,892
They will not spare you.

1331
01:20:06,767 --> 01:20:08,683
If you both want to live together,

1332
01:20:08,767 --> 01:20:10,392
Then let me go,
I shall take care of the rest.

1333
01:20:10,892 --> 01:20:12,558
I shall take care of that,
you come now.

1334
01:20:12,809 --> 01:20:13,600
Hey!

1335
01:20:13,850 --> 01:20:15,308
Are you trying to become a hero?

1336
01:20:15,892 --> 01:20:16,892
Very difficult.

1337
01:20:17,141 --> 01:20:18,600
Sister, why don’t you tell him?

1338
01:20:18,975 --> 01:20:20,016
Tell him to leave me.

1339
01:20:20,350 --> 01:20:21,517
Only that can you save you.

1340
01:20:25,392 --> 01:20:27,141
What are you looking at?
-No.

1341
01:20:27,683 --> 01:20:29,058
I am concerned about you.

1342
01:20:30,058 --> 01:20:32,600
You came with him, even though
you knew your life is at risk.

1343
01:20:32,642 --> 01:20:34,183
So I understood about you.

1344
01:20:36,558 --> 01:20:38,558
I want at least your love
to succeed.

1345
01:20:38,767 --> 01:20:39,850
Does that mean,

1346
01:20:40,642 --> 01:20:42,642
you too had a love?

1347
01:20:43,433 --> 01:20:44,767
Where is that girl now?

1348
01:20:46,141 --> 01:20:47,058
Oh my!

1349
01:20:48,892 --> 01:20:49,892
Tell me brother.

1350
01:20:50,558 --> 01:20:51,725
That is nothing dear.

1351
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:53,475
It was just a one side love.

1352
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:55,350
Didn’t you propose to her?

1353
01:20:55,433 --> 01:20:56,308
You should have.

1354
01:20:56,350 --> 01:20:57,683
I thought of telling it to her.

1355
01:20:58,016 --> 01:20:59,058
But I couldn’t.

1356
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:01,350
You should profess your love.
-Hey Revathi!

1357
01:21:03,266 --> 01:21:04,225
Keep quiet!

1358
01:21:05,642 --> 01:21:06,975
Always talking nonsense!

1359
01:21:09,308 --> 01:21:11,100
Brother, who is that?

1360
01:21:12,975 --> 01:21:14,225
CM.

1361
01:21:14,934 --> 01:21:15,934
CM?

1362
01:21:16,850 --> 01:21:18,683
Oh my!

1363
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:23,600
The same CM that sent
the henchmen to kill us.

1364
01:21:23,725 --> 01:21:25,308
Maybe I should have told her, then
all this could have been avoided.

1365
01:21:25,350 --> 01:21:26,600
Superb brother.
-Hey!

1366
01:21:27,225 --> 01:21:28,767
He is blabbering unnecessarily.

1367
01:21:29,475 --> 01:21:31,392
I am not blabbering,
I am telling the truth.

1368
01:21:31,725 --> 01:21:34,350
Yes Shiva,
when he was talking about her,

1369
01:21:34,558 --> 01:21:36,642
I could see a love spark in
his eyes.

1370
01:21:37,016 --> 01:21:38,100
-You could see?
-Yes!

1371
01:21:38,141 --> 01:21:39,934
Oh! Great, now come.

1372
01:21:40,850 --> 01:21:42,392
And please keep quiet for
some time.

1373
01:21:42,642 --> 01:21:44,683
Let’s focus on getting out of
this place safely.

1374
01:21:44,892 --> 01:21:46,183
That is impossible.

1375
01:21:46,850 --> 01:21:49,141
I bet that you cannot even go
beyond this limit.

1376
01:21:50,308 --> 01:21:51,934
You don’t know about this Natraj.

1377
01:21:52,725 --> 01:21:54,141
I thought…

1378
01:21:56,016 --> 01:21:57,475
he came to save me.

1379
01:22:00,225 --> 01:22:01,683
Just ask my brother to get here.

1380
01:22:02,016 --> 01:22:04,266
I shall go with him and finish
this once and for all.

1381
01:22:04,392 --> 01:22:05,558
You take her and leave.

1382
01:22:07,767 --> 01:22:09,975
I think that what he says
is right.

1383
01:22:10,725 --> 01:22:13,100
I have no hope that we could
go beyond all these men.

1384
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:15,100
But I have hope.

1385
01:22:15,809 --> 01:22:18,934
I have hope that
I would submit him in the court.

1386
01:22:19,141 --> 01:22:20,225
Hey! Damn!

1387
01:22:20,683 --> 01:22:22,725
Why do you keep repeating
the same thing? Are you senseless?

1388
01:22:22,809 --> 01:22:24,225
Leave me!
Leave me I say.

1389
01:22:24,266 --> 01:22:25,058
Hey!

1390
01:22:25,517 --> 01:22:26,350
Hey!

1391
01:22:30,725 --> 01:22:32,517
How many times to tell you?
Can’t you understand?

1392
01:22:48,934 --> 01:22:50,016
Brother!

1393
01:22:51,934 --> 01:22:53,475
Why are you hitting me in
the same spot?

1394
01:22:54,266 --> 01:22:55,558
Shiva!
-Hey, wait, wait!

1395
01:22:55,934 --> 01:22:57,975
Please, don’t fight.

1396
01:22:58,475 --> 01:23:00,266
Why are you fighting unnecessarily?

1397
01:23:01,767 --> 01:23:03,600
No one in your department
is bothered.

1398
01:23:03,809 --> 01:23:04,975
Is it only for you?

1399
01:23:06,183 --> 01:23:07,683
What he says is right.

1400
01:23:07,975 --> 01:23:09,225
Why don’t we leave?

1401
01:23:10,517 --> 01:23:11,809
You are important to me.

1402
01:23:12,183 --> 01:23:13,433
How can I leave and go?

1403
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:14,292
Huh?

1404
01:23:14,392 --> 01:23:15,517
How can I leave him?

1405
01:23:16,683 --> 01:23:19,475
How can I leave even after knowing that
he is the one who killed my brother??

1406
01:23:20,809 --> 01:23:21,600
Damn!

1407
01:23:26,141 --> 01:23:27,934
What did my brother do to you?

1408
01:24:05,517 --> 01:24:08,350
“Every direction on the earth,”

1409
01:24:08,558 --> 01:24:10,809
“Shall proclaim our story.”

1410
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:14,058
“Every nook and cranny,”

1411
01:24:14,392 --> 01:24:16,892
“Shall be filled with our song.”

1412
01:24:17,433 --> 01:24:20,016
“Just like conjoined twins,”

1413
01:24:20,433 --> 01:24:23,183
“Let’s hug and dwell in love.”

1414
01:24:23,392 --> 01:24:26,183
“This bond shall never
worn away,”

1415
01:24:26,392 --> 01:24:29,058
“Because this is the boon
of God.”

1416
01:24:29,266 --> 01:24:32,392
“Every direction on the earth,”

1417
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:35,058
“Shall proclaim our story,”

1418
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:37,934
“Shall proclaim our story.”

1419
01:25:26,517 --> 01:25:29,100
“Even if we are together
for seven births,”

1420
01:25:29,433 --> 01:25:32,058
“We will ask for some more.”

1421
01:25:32,350 --> 01:25:35,266
“We will do penance,”

1422
01:25:35,517 --> 01:25:37,975
“To be born together in
our mother’s womb.”

1423
01:25:38,350 --> 01:25:41,183
“We cannot live without
each other,”

1424
01:25:41,392 --> 01:25:44,100
“We will always stay united.”

1425
01:25:44,308 --> 01:25:47,141
“Holding hands together,”

1426
01:25:47,308 --> 01:25:49,934
“We will stay forever.”

1427
01:25:50,392 --> 01:25:55,850
“Who can be like us in
this world?”

1428
01:25:56,308 --> 01:26:01,350
“Really there is none anywhere.”

1429
01:26:02,475 --> 01:26:05,183
“Every direction on the earth,”

1430
01:26:05,475 --> 01:26:07,934
“Shall proclaim our story.”

1431
01:26:08,308 --> 01:26:11,266
“Every nook and cranny,”

1432
01:26:11,517 --> 01:26:13,892
“Shall be filled with our song.”

1433
01:26:14,308 --> 01:26:17,225
“Just like conjoined twins,”

1434
01:26:17,433 --> 01:26:20,183
“Let’s hug and dwell in love.”

1435
01:26:20,433 --> 01:26:23,266
“This bond shall never
worn away,”

1436
01:26:23,433 --> 01:26:26,517
“Because this is the boon
of God.”

1437
01:26:26,725 --> 01:26:29,183
“Every direction on the earth,”

1438
01:26:29,392 --> 01:26:31,725
“Shall proclaim our story,”

1439
01:26:32,433 --> 01:26:35,517
“Shall proclaim our story.”

1440
01:26:44,642 --> 01:26:45,850
Hey!
-Hmm.

1441
01:26:47,141 --> 01:26:48,225
What do you want to be?

1442
01:26:49,642 --> 01:26:50,725
Don’t you know?

1443
01:26:51,058 --> 01:26:52,892
I want to become a police, a SI.

1444
01:26:53,308 --> 01:26:54,975
I must do a lot of good to
the people.

1445
01:26:56,892 --> 01:26:58,683
That is my passion.

1446
01:26:59,809 --> 01:27:00,725
Hey Vishnu!

1447
01:27:01,308 --> 01:27:03,642
This serious demeanor doesn’t
suit you.

1448
01:27:03,934 --> 01:27:05,892
You be carefree as usual, okay?

1449
01:27:06,100 --> 01:27:07,225
I am happy for you man.

1450
01:27:07,266 --> 01:27:08,183
Thanks, man.

1451
01:27:11,392 --> 01:27:12,850
Hey hi!
-Hi, how are you?

1452
01:27:12,934 --> 01:27:13,850
Is that Srikanth here?

1453
01:27:13,892 --> 01:27:15,558
Everybody is here, only we are late.
-Shiva!

1454
01:27:16,141 --> 01:27:17,583
Go to the town and get
this medicine.

1455
01:27:17,683 --> 01:27:20,141
Mom! Dad is working
in the Government Hospital.

1456
01:27:20,350 --> 01:27:22,642
Won’t this be available there?
We have a match, mom.

1457
01:27:22,683 --> 01:27:24,208
This medicine is available
only in that shop.

1458
01:27:24,308 --> 01:27:26,417
You keep acquainting with these
useless fellows,

1459
01:27:26,517 --> 01:27:28,500
and keep roaming all the grounds,
playing cricket.

1460
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:29,850
No way mom.
-Here take this.

1461
01:27:30,016 --> 01:27:31,750
You could have told about
this yesterday.

1462
01:27:31,850 --> 01:27:33,225
Today I have a match.
Mom!

1463
01:27:33,392 --> 01:27:35,308
As if you are the great
Sachin Tendulkar. Go now.

1464
01:27:35,475 --> 01:27:37,725
Hey are we going to the ground now?
You just go and start the match.

1465
01:27:37,892 --> 01:27:39,625
If you win the toss,
select batting.

1466
01:27:39,725 --> 01:27:41,642
-I’m coming!
-For that we have to win the toss.

1467
01:27:47,308 --> 01:27:48,600
-Hey Vishnu?
-Hah!

1468
01:27:48,642 --> 01:27:50,600
Go to the town and buy this
medicine for dad.

1469
01:27:50,725 --> 01:27:52,100
Okay bye.
-Hey, wait!

1470
01:27:52,433 --> 01:27:54,266
Your sister-in-law is waiting
for me.

1471
01:27:54,850 --> 01:27:56,600
We have to finalize
the invitation as well.

1472
01:27:57,266 --> 01:27:58,183
So?

1473
01:27:58,725 --> 01:27:59,725
Here take this.

1474
01:27:59,809 --> 01:28:02,809
Your invitation is important
that buying medicine for dad?

1475
01:28:03,433 --> 01:28:05,308
Hey! You fool! What are you saying?
-Hey!

1476
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:06,558
You are not even married,

1477
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:08,642
but there are a lot of changes
in your activities.

1478
01:28:08,767 --> 01:28:09,583
-Mom!
-Yeah?

1479
01:28:09,683 --> 01:28:11,517
He has changed
even before getting married.

1480
01:28:11,558 --> 01:28:12,809
Imagine what will happen
after marriage!

1481
01:28:12,850 --> 01:28:15,058
-Let him do anything, you go now.
-She is telling you only, so go now.

1482
01:28:15,100 --> 01:28:17,433
Hey, please listen to me. Your
sister-in-law is waiting for me.

1483
01:28:17,558 --> 01:28:18,850
Hey, Vishnu!

1484
01:28:19,850 --> 01:28:21,725
You are the man in the house,
after dad.

1485
01:28:22,141 --> 01:28:23,975
So you have to take care of all
these responsibilities.

1486
01:28:24,058 --> 01:28:25,266
Try to understand, okay!

1487
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,225
Go now, there is no time.
-Hey!

1488
01:28:27,266 --> 01:28:28,500
Hey! You are very cunning!

1489
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:30,392
You just take advantage of
my innocence.

1490
01:28:30,433 --> 01:28:31,600
I curse you now!

1491
01:28:31,934 --> 01:28:34,350
You guys will never win any of the game.
-Okay man, I shall take care of that.

1492
01:28:34,392 --> 01:28:36,141
You will lose every match you guys play.
-Okay man thank you so much.

1493
01:28:36,183 --> 01:28:38,517
You will become duck out. You will
not even get a chance to play.

1494
01:28:43,850 --> 01:28:45,058
Hello? Milk society?

1495
01:28:45,725 --> 01:28:46,892
Hey, it’s me.

1496
01:28:47,016 --> 01:28:47,892
Where are you?

1497
01:28:47,975 --> 01:28:49,809
Sorry, I have to get medicine
for my dad…

1498
01:28:49,934 --> 01:28:51,433
so I will be a little late.

1499
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:52,683
What?

1500
01:28:52,892 --> 01:28:54,225
Okay, love you.

1501
01:28:54,975 --> 01:28:56,266
I shall come soon okay? Bye!

1502
01:28:56,517 --> 01:28:57,892
Give me a kiss now.
-Hmm?

1503
01:28:58,475 --> 01:29:00,058
I know that you will not give me.
Hang up.

1504
01:29:11,183 --> 01:29:13,183
Hey…there is baby!

1505
01:29:13,308 --> 01:29:14,350
Dear!

1506
01:29:53,517 --> 01:29:55,350
Move! Quick.

1507
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:01,392
Hey!

1508
01:30:05,392 --> 01:30:06,892
Hey! Come out!

1509
01:30:07,558 --> 01:30:08,600
How?

1510
01:30:10,975 --> 01:30:14,517
Come fast!
Come on!

1511
01:30:14,683 --> 01:30:16,475
Come fast! Come….come…

1512
01:30:17,308 --> 01:30:18,642
Happy birthday, dear!

1513
01:30:29,683 --> 01:30:32,016
Get up! It’s okay!

1514
01:30:32,642 --> 01:30:34,433
Madam!! Come here.

1515
01:30:35,975 --> 01:30:38,183
Take this kid, fast.
-Okay, sir!

1516
01:30:40,642 --> 01:30:42,308
It is paining a lot.
-Don’t worry, come!

1517
01:30:42,934 --> 01:30:43,892
Hey!

1518
01:31:11,975 --> 01:31:12,934
Vishnu!

1519
01:31:15,850 --> 01:31:16,809
Vishnu….

1520
01:31:17,517 --> 01:31:18,392
Vishnu!

1521
01:31:19,350 --> 01:31:20,225
Vishnu!

1522
01:31:21,350 --> 01:31:22,350
Vishnu!

1523
01:31:26,016 --> 01:31:26,975
Vishnu!

1524
01:31:32,892 --> 01:31:33,683
Vishnu….

1525
01:31:34,350 --> 01:31:35,600
Vishnu!
-Hey, move!

1526
01:31:35,934 --> 01:31:37,892
Come, come! Move fast!

1527
01:31:38,225 --> 01:31:39,975
Come,come. Fast, faster!

1528
01:31:41,308 --> 01:31:42,975
Move, move! Fast, faster!

1529
01:31:44,100 --> 01:31:45,642
Vishnu….
-Come, fast!

1530
01:31:46,892 --> 01:31:48,308
Vishnu!
-Come, come!

1531
01:32:05,266 --> 01:32:07,266
Vishnu….Vishnu, look at me.
This is Shiva.

1532
01:32:07,433 --> 01:32:08,975
You are alright. Vishnu!

1533
01:32:09,100 --> 01:32:10,975
Nurse, please check him.

1534
01:32:12,183 --> 01:32:14,475
You escaped man.
-Vishnu!

1535
01:32:16,517 --> 01:32:17,308
Hey!

1536
01:32:18,392 --> 01:32:19,642
Vishnu!

1537
01:32:20,809 --> 01:32:22,058
Vishnu, don’t talk like that.

1538
01:32:22,392 --> 01:32:23,934
Don’t you cry.

1539
01:32:24,225 --> 01:32:25,517
I am sorry, man.
-I am just kidding…

1540
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:26,725
I am kidding man.

1541
01:32:26,809 --> 01:32:27,683
Sorry!

1542
01:32:28,433 --> 01:32:29,308
Hey!

1543
01:32:29,517 --> 01:32:31,392
If I die, you should take care
of things.

1544
01:32:32,392 --> 01:32:34,308
Hey! No…
-You should take care of mom, dad!

1545
01:32:35,183 --> 01:32:36,517
Don’t talk like that Vishnu!

1546
01:32:37,100 --> 01:32:38,600
You have to get medicines for dad.
-Vishnu!

1547
01:32:38,809 --> 01:32:40,517
Don’t talk like that brother,
please!

1548
01:32:41,934 --> 01:32:43,892
I am there for you right?
Please.

1549
01:32:44,725 --> 01:32:47,058
Why do you suddenly
call me as brother?

1550
01:32:49,558 --> 01:32:51,308
You know that I will not
make it, right?

1551
01:32:51,517 --> 01:32:52,975
Hey….Hey…

1552
01:32:53,183 --> 01:32:54,433
Why do you talk like this?

1553
01:32:54,683 --> 01:32:55,892
Have you gone mad?

1554
01:32:56,100 --> 01:32:57,892
I am telling that nothing will
happen to you right?

1555
01:32:57,934 --> 01:32:59,016
Please stay strong.

1556
01:32:59,225 --> 01:33:01,600
Brother, please go fast.

1557
01:33:01,975 --> 01:33:03,183
Your sister-in-law!

1558
01:33:03,392 --> 01:33:05,558
She will be waiting for me there.

1559
01:33:06,850 --> 01:33:08,934
Everything is over before
the wedding.

1560
01:33:09,058 --> 01:33:10,208
What are you talking?

1561
01:33:10,308 --> 01:33:11,517
Nothing is wrong with you.

1562
01:33:11,558 --> 01:33:13,642
We will reach the hospital in five
minutes. Everything will be alright.

1563
01:33:13,975 --> 01:33:15,683
We shall go home soon. Okay?

1564
01:33:15,892 --> 01:33:17,100
Nothing is wrong with you.

1565
01:33:19,141 --> 01:33:20,058
Hey! Hey!

1566
01:33:22,058 --> 01:33:23,975
I had many desires.
-Don’t cry Vishnu!

1567
01:33:24,058 --> 01:33:26,225
Police…SI…

1568
01:33:27,558 --> 01:33:28,475
Don’t cry!

1569
01:33:29,725 --> 01:33:31,125
I wanted to do many good things
to people.

1570
01:33:31,225 --> 01:33:32,475
You will definitely help people.

1571
01:33:32,517 --> 01:33:33,625
You will help everyone.

1572
01:33:33,725 --> 01:33:36,058
Now you just listen to me.
All your desires shall come true.

1573
01:33:36,266 --> 01:33:38,350
Vishnu….Vishnu…
Nurse! Nurse!

1574
01:33:38,558 --> 01:33:39,683
Please check on him.

1575
01:33:40,183 --> 01:33:42,433
[Indistinct voices]

1576
01:33:43,100 --> 01:33:44,350
Hey what happened?

1577
01:33:44,433 --> 01:33:45,809
Clear the traffic!

1578
01:33:48,517 --> 01:33:49,392
Brother!

1579
01:33:50,266 --> 01:33:51,892
Vishnu! Hey, Vishnu!

1580
01:33:52,100 --> 01:33:53,375
Vishnu….Vishnu!

1581
01:33:53,475 --> 01:33:55,016
Nurse just now
he was speaking with me.

1582
01:33:55,934 --> 01:33:57,809
Nurse, please do something fast.

1583
01:33:58,058 --> 01:33:59,517
Vishnu….Vishnu!
Please wake up!

1584
01:33:59,642 --> 01:34:00,767
Brother please go fast.

1585
01:34:00,850 --> 01:34:02,016
Please go fast.

1586
01:34:02,058 --> 01:34:04,475
Hey! Vishnu get up, please.

1587
01:34:04,975 --> 01:34:05,850
Vishnu!!

1588
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:14,141
Vishnu…hey!

1589
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:20,141
Hey Vishnu!

1590
01:34:22,934 --> 01:34:23,850
Hey!

1591
01:34:29,266 --> 01:34:34,225
Since my brother died in
the blast, I got his police job.

1592
01:34:36,183 --> 01:34:37,225
Just for his sake,

1593
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:41,225
I started to live the life of
a police that he desired so much.

1594
01:34:45,433 --> 01:34:48,975
Along with my brother, so many people
were killed for their political gain.

1595
01:34:50,725 --> 01:34:52,975
They convinced everyone that
it was an accident.

1596
01:34:55,433 --> 01:34:57,433
When I knew that he murdered
my brother,

1597
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:00,183
I just wanted to kill him first.

1598
01:35:02,058 --> 01:35:04,058
But then,
no one would ever know the truth.

1599
01:35:06,433 --> 01:35:08,475
The family of the victims should
know the truth.

1600
01:35:09,517 --> 01:35:11,767
Only then their souls would
rest in peace.

1601
01:35:13,433 --> 01:35:14,350
Come, let’s go.

1602
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:19,475
Get up.

1603
01:35:25,141 --> 01:35:26,475
There is excessive bleeding.

1604
01:35:27,433 --> 01:35:29,141
You also told that
the bullet is lodged inside.

1605
01:35:29,517 --> 01:35:30,809
We should check immediately.

1606
01:35:30,934 --> 01:35:32,225
Else it will become very worse.

1607
01:35:35,100 --> 01:35:36,016
Okay come.

1608
01:35:42,392 --> 01:35:45,266
[indistinct voices]

1609
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:53,433
[humming song]

1610
01:36:02,475 --> 01:36:04,141
-Hi.
-What dear?

1611
01:36:04,183 --> 01:36:05,141
You want lift?

1612
01:36:05,266 --> 01:36:06,100
No!

1613
01:36:06,433 --> 01:36:07,375
I need the car itself.

1614
01:36:07,475 --> 01:36:08,725
Hey! Hey!

1615
01:36:08,975 --> 01:36:11,392
Thought to lift you and
you’ve lifted the car itself.

1616
01:36:11,525 --> 01:36:12,275
Damn!

1617
01:36:12,441 --> 01:36:13,483
He is here, speak now.

1618
01:36:14,483 --> 01:36:15,275
Hello?

1619
01:36:15,316 --> 01:36:16,067
Uncle?

1620
01:36:16,275 --> 01:36:17,316
Yeah tell me Pandu.

1621
01:36:17,358 --> 01:36:18,692
How are you all?

1622
01:36:18,775 --> 01:36:20,192
We are all fine.

1623
01:36:20,733 --> 01:36:22,608
But did you hear anything
about Shiva.

1624
01:36:22,733 --> 01:36:26,234
No, but he will be cautious
for sure.

1625
01:36:26,441 --> 01:36:28,775
Uncle, please be careful until
he comes back.

1626
01:36:28,983 --> 01:36:29,733
Yeah.

1627
01:36:29,775 --> 01:36:30,983
Bye uncle.
-Okay.

1628
01:36:35,192 --> 01:36:36,441
Give me the change.

1629
01:36:37,983 --> 01:36:38,983
Greetings!

1630
01:36:42,566 --> 01:36:44,817
Hello, Guntur, Sri Balaji Lodge?

1631
01:36:50,817 --> 01:36:51,942
Take a left here.

1632
01:36:51,983 --> 01:36:53,150
There is a hospital there.

1633
01:36:54,192 --> 01:36:56,192
Hey, Revathi! Wait, wait!
-What happened?

1634
01:36:56,692 --> 01:36:57,842
The police are here.
Take a reverse!

1635
01:36:57,942 --> 01:36:58,733
Take a reverse!

1636
01:37:00,900 --> 01:37:02,192
Go straight!
Go straight!

1637
01:37:04,025 --> 01:37:05,275
Hey, police!

1638
01:37:05,525 --> 01:37:06,483
Go into this house.

1639
01:37:06,566 --> 01:37:08,025
This house!
-Here?

1640
01:37:10,358 --> 01:37:11,900
Revathi be casual.

1641
01:37:12,109 --> 01:37:14,817
Just open the gate and park
the car in there.

1642
01:37:26,234 --> 01:37:27,316
Yeah I am coming.

1643
01:37:28,234 --> 01:37:29,109
Please wait.

1644
01:37:32,316 --> 01:37:34,466
-Who is that? Who are you guys?
-Madam please there is an emergency.

1645
01:37:34,566 --> 01:37:36,758
-Why are you coming in here? Who are you?
-We just need to make a phone call.

1646
01:37:36,858 --> 01:37:39,316
-Philip, look! Someone is here!
-One phone call, please help us, please!

1647
01:37:39,358 --> 01:37:40,525
Why are closing the gate?

1648
01:37:40,858 --> 01:37:42,758
-Madam please help us.
-Who are you guys, now tell me.

1649
01:37:42,858 --> 01:37:43,800
I am a police.

1650
01:37:43,900 --> 01:37:45,316
-Who are you guys?
-Madam, please!

1651
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:46,942
Sir! Sir!
-Please go out.

1652
01:37:47,025 --> 01:37:49,025
-Who are you?
-Sir, my name is Shiva.

1653
01:37:49,109 --> 01:37:51,858
I am a constable at Sakinetipalli
Police Station, ID number 1302.

1654
01:37:52,150 --> 01:37:54,234
He is an accused in my custody.

1655
01:37:55,275 --> 01:37:56,275
What happened?
-Sir!

1656
01:37:56,692 --> 01:37:58,650
Sir he is hit by a bullet.
There is excessive blood loss.

1657
01:37:58,983 --> 01:38:00,275
Can I make a call to a doctor?

1658
01:38:00,483 --> 01:38:01,441
When did this happen?

1659
01:38:01,483 --> 01:38:02,441
Yesterday night.

1660
01:38:02,483 --> 01:38:03,983
We have just given some
first aid.

1661
01:38:05,692 --> 01:38:07,400
Okay bring him in.
-Thanks sir.

1662
01:38:07,733 --> 01:38:08,817
Please come, be careful.

1663
01:38:18,275 --> 01:38:20,358
Sir, do you know
what you are doing?

1664
01:38:20,566 --> 01:38:21,650
Relax! Relax!

1665
01:38:24,483 --> 01:38:25,608
How did this happen?

1666
01:38:25,817 --> 01:38:28,441
I was in night duty at the station.
-Oh!

1667
01:38:49,275 --> 01:38:51,358
Sir, is everything okay?
-Hmm.

1668
01:38:51,942 --> 01:38:53,025
Nothing to worry.

1669
01:38:53,109 --> 01:38:55,358
He must rest for two days and
he would be alright.

1670
01:38:55,983 --> 01:38:58,692
I have to hand him over to the CBI
court at Bangalore tomorrow morning.

1671
01:38:58,900 --> 01:38:59,817
Hey!

1672
01:39:00,483 --> 01:39:01,942
I have done first aid…

1673
01:39:02,608 --> 01:39:04,525
and there will not be
any problem for 6-8 hours.

1674
01:39:10,109 --> 01:39:10,983
Hello?

1675
01:39:11,275 --> 01:39:13,441
Hello sir, this is Shiva.

1676
01:39:13,608 --> 01:39:15,608
Shiva, where are you now?

1677
01:39:15,983 --> 01:39:20,067
They are saying that you locked up
George and escaped with Raju?

1678
01:39:20,483 --> 01:39:21,358
No sir,

1679
01:39:21,566 --> 01:39:23,525
they tried to kill George at
the station.

1680
01:39:23,983 --> 01:39:26,109
George and I saved Raju and
took him with us.

1681
01:39:26,150 --> 01:39:27,025
Huh!

1682
01:39:27,358 --> 01:39:28,483
Give the phone to George.

1683
01:39:32,067 --> 01:39:34,858
IG Natraj has killed George sir.

1684
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:39,234
Now the entire police department
is searching for us.

1685
01:39:39,566 --> 01:39:41,358
I don’t know what to do.

1686
01:39:41,692 --> 01:39:43,234
Raju has a bullet injury.

1687
01:39:44,234 --> 01:39:45,525
Where are you now?

1688
01:39:46,067 --> 01:39:46,900
Sir…

1689
01:39:47,608 --> 01:39:50,983
I am at the home
of an ex-military officer.

1690
01:39:51,817 --> 01:39:52,983
You stay there,

1691
01:39:53,858 --> 01:39:55,400
I shall send my team.

1692
01:39:56,234 --> 01:39:58,316
An officer Ranjit will come and
take you from there.

1693
01:39:58,525 --> 01:39:59,316
Okay sir.

1694
01:40:03,150 --> 01:40:03,942
Sir!

1695
01:40:04,775 --> 01:40:09,067
I think there is some link
between that constable and Raju.

1696
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:15,692
That is why he has destroyed
the entire station and saved him.

1697
01:40:15,983 --> 01:40:16,817
What’s this, sir?

1698
01:40:17,067 --> 01:40:21,109
He has taken an accused and
a CBI officer from your custody,

1699
01:40:21,192 --> 01:40:22,383
But you seem pretty casual
about that?

1700
01:40:22,483 --> 01:40:24,150
What caution have you taken
so far?

1701
01:40:25,525 --> 01:40:26,858
Sir! We are searching.

1702
01:40:28,025 --> 01:40:29,067
We shall find them soon.

1703
01:40:29,150 --> 01:40:32,525
Sir! We need all the details
about this case at once.

1704
01:40:32,608 --> 01:40:36,316
Sir! If you don’t co-operate,
then I have to report to Delhi.

1705
01:40:39,525 --> 01:40:40,525
Then you do one thing.

1706
01:40:41,692 --> 01:40:43,608
Get a letter from commissioner.

1707
01:40:43,858 --> 01:40:44,733
Huh?

1708
01:40:44,858 --> 01:40:46,358
Sir, one second.

1709
01:40:46,775 --> 01:40:47,817
Hello?
-Ranjit,

1710
01:40:48,316 --> 01:40:49,525
just now Shiva called me.

1711
01:40:49,900 --> 01:40:51,758
You told that you were meeting
with an officer Natraj,

1712
01:40:51,858 --> 01:40:53,441
who is handling this case right?
-Yes, sir!

1713
01:40:53,650 --> 01:40:55,566
That man has killed our George.

1714
01:40:58,817 --> 01:41:01,192
Yes sir,
I am now with him.

1715
01:41:01,983 --> 01:41:02,900
Shit!

1716
01:41:04,983 --> 01:41:07,192
Now don’t let him know that
we are aware of this.

1717
01:41:07,608 --> 01:41:08,900
Raju is now with Shiva.

1718
01:41:09,608 --> 01:41:12,692
He is safe in the house
of an ex-military officer house.

1719
01:41:13,192 --> 01:41:14,858
You meet them immediately there.

1720
01:41:15,316 --> 01:41:16,942
No one must know about this.

1721
01:41:17,441 --> 01:41:19,441
And one more thing.
Listen to me carefully.

1722
01:41:20,067 --> 01:41:21,775
That Natraj is a dangerous guy.

1723
01:41:22,358 --> 01:41:23,817
We are alone in this case.

1724
01:41:24,109 --> 01:41:25,566
Okay, sir!
Okay!

1725
01:41:27,733 --> 01:41:30,983
Sir, I shall meet the commissioner
and get the letter.

1726
01:41:32,650 --> 01:41:33,525
Okay sir.

1727
01:41:36,692 --> 01:41:38,067
This issue is getting serious.

1728
01:41:38,234 --> 01:41:40,942
Varghese sir called now.
We have to go there immediately.

1729
01:41:46,692 --> 01:41:48,400
Ah…here take this.

1730
01:41:49,983 --> 01:41:53,316
Your dress is torn
so change into these clothes.

1731
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:56,275
There are clothes for your
friends as well.

1732
01:41:56,733 --> 01:41:58,067
Thanks aunty.
-That’s okay.

1733
01:41:58,234 --> 01:42:00,525
Did you eat anything dear?

1734
01:42:01,234 --> 01:42:01,983
No.

1735
01:42:02,316 --> 01:42:03,692
I am very hungry.

1736
01:42:04,109 --> 01:42:06,400
Since yesterday night they are
chasing us. We have been running.

1737
01:42:07,400 --> 01:42:08,316
Oh my!

1738
01:42:08,608 --> 01:42:10,400
You go and get refreshed.

1739
01:42:10,692 --> 01:42:13,025
I shall prepare some food for you.
Get ready and come.

1740
01:42:16,900 --> 01:42:18,942
Are you okay? Do you want something?
-Okay,

1741
01:42:19,858 --> 01:42:20,942
can I get a cigarette sir?

1742
01:42:21,650 --> 01:42:22,525
Hm?

1743
01:42:23,483 --> 01:42:24,650
It’s okay if you don’t have.

1744
01:42:26,942 --> 01:42:28,067
Are you a doctor?

1745
01:42:28,858 --> 01:42:30,483
No, an ex-army officer.

1746
01:42:31,192 --> 01:42:32,566
Then you must have rum, right?

1747
01:42:33,650 --> 01:42:34,608
Hey!

1748
01:42:34,692 --> 01:42:36,067
Usually they give that for pain.

1749
01:42:39,608 --> 01:42:41,650
How do you know all this
if you are not a doctor?

1750
01:42:42,067 --> 01:42:44,067
They taught all this in our
army training.

1751
01:42:44,192 --> 01:42:45,650
For emergency purposes in
the field.

1752
01:42:47,109 --> 01:42:49,109
It will be nice if the government
taught this to us.

1753
01:42:49,733 --> 01:42:51,234
We too face many emergencies.

1754
01:42:52,566 --> 01:42:54,275
How many men would you
have killed?

1755
01:42:55,483 --> 01:42:56,441
Why do you ask?

1756
01:42:57,025 --> 01:42:58,608
Just for some general knowledge.

1757
01:42:58,983 --> 01:43:00,525
What can you do with
that knowledge?

1758
01:43:00,942 --> 01:43:01,608
Sir!

1759
01:43:01,692 --> 01:43:03,692
You kill under government orders
and so do I.

1760
01:43:04,025 --> 01:43:06,150
But you are given medals while
I am branded as an accused.

1761
01:43:06,358 --> 01:43:07,858
What a comparison!

1762
01:43:08,192 --> 01:43:10,733
We kill enemies
for the safety of our country,

1763
01:43:11,025 --> 01:43:13,983
and you kill innocent people
for the corrupt politicians.

1764
01:43:14,566 --> 01:43:15,650
Don’t justify your murders.

1765
01:43:15,692 --> 01:43:17,275
Sir! A murder is a murder.

1766
01:43:17,650 --> 01:43:20,192
The person that I kill has a family
and so will the person that you kill.

1767
01:43:21,566 --> 01:43:22,900
You are one justifying murders.

1768
01:43:23,109 --> 01:43:24,400
Everyone has feelings.

1769
01:43:24,650 --> 01:43:27,192
Tomorrow the court will decide
which is right and which is wrong.

1770
01:43:27,400 --> 01:43:28,817
Why do you keep talking to
him sir?

1771
01:43:28,942 --> 01:43:30,234
What is wrong in what I say?

1772
01:43:30,566 --> 01:43:31,817
He is justifying everything…

1773
01:43:34,150 --> 01:43:35,067
Silence!

1774
01:43:40,942 --> 01:43:41,817
Who is that?

1775
01:43:42,234 --> 01:43:44,692
I am Ranjit
sent by CBI head Varghese.

1776
01:43:45,067 --> 01:43:46,608
Is anyone by the name Shiva here?

1777
01:43:50,192 --> 01:43:51,150
We are here.

1778
01:43:53,650 --> 01:43:55,316
I am Ranjit from CBI.

1779
01:43:59,566 --> 01:44:01,858
Shiva, main road is not that safe.

1780
01:44:03,192 --> 01:44:05,775
Five kilometres from here to the left,
you will find a path in the woods.

1781
01:44:05,858 --> 01:44:07,817
Take that. You will be safe.

1782
01:44:21,150 --> 01:44:21,942
Hey!

1783
01:44:38,358 --> 01:44:40,234
Hey, a vehicle is approaching.
Take a reverse!

1784
01:44:52,817 --> 01:44:54,025
Stay down! Stay down!

1785
01:44:54,067 --> 01:44:56,275
Hey! Suresh you go out.
Sundar you come with me.

1786
01:44:56,400 --> 01:44:57,234
Hey!

1787
01:44:58,192 --> 01:44:59,566
What are you staring at?

1788
01:45:03,400 --> 01:45:05,275
None of you want to
become the next Raju?

1789
01:45:05,733 --> 01:45:06,566
Oh!

1790
01:45:07,025 --> 01:45:08,608
You will proceed only if
I say action?

1791
01:45:08,817 --> 01:45:09,942
Go guys!

1792
01:45:17,900 --> 01:45:18,733
Shiva,

1793
01:45:19,234 --> 01:45:20,733
these guys cannot manage.

1794
01:45:21,525 --> 01:45:22,650
Just untie me, here!

1795
01:45:23,525 --> 01:45:25,733
Hey! Keep quiet,
they will take care.

1796
01:45:36,067 --> 01:45:37,942
Listen to me they will
kill everyone.

1797
01:45:38,025 --> 01:45:38,983
Untie me.

1798
01:45:41,234 --> 01:45:43,400
Shiva I will not escape.
Just untie me man!

1799
01:47:31,316 --> 01:47:33,109
Who wanted to become
the next Razu?

1800
01:47:33,983 --> 01:47:34,900
Come on!

1801
01:47:35,650 --> 01:47:36,525
Come!

1802
01:47:41,942 --> 01:47:43,109
Razu!

1803
01:48:56,775 --> 01:48:57,900
Sir no one is here.

1804
01:48:57,942 --> 01:48:58,900
They have escaped!

1805
01:48:58,942 --> 01:48:59,817
What??

1806
01:49:12,109 --> 01:49:13,358
Is evething okay?

1807
01:49:13,775 --> 01:49:14,550
Is evething okay?

1808
01:49:14,650 --> 01:49:16,234
Shiva, they are checking
for something.

1809
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:17,234
There!

1810
01:49:17,275 --> 01:49:18,150
Come, let's go

1811
01:49:39,358 --> 01:49:43,316
Guys who grew under my tutelage
wants to kill me,

1812
01:49:45,483 --> 01:49:46,942
to become the next Razu.

1813
01:49:51,150 --> 01:49:53,109
The people who I knew
are trying to kill me.

1814
01:49:53,316 --> 01:49:55,358
But you are trying to keep
me alive.

1815
01:49:56,817 --> 01:49:58,733
Just wait and watch
what I do to these guys.

1816
01:50:00,566 --> 01:50:01,566
What can you do?

1817
01:50:02,858 --> 01:50:04,067
Are you going to kill them?

1818
01:50:04,234 --> 01:50:05,025
Yes!

1819
01:50:05,316 --> 01:50:06,441
How many can you kill?

1820
01:50:06,650 --> 01:50:07,650
They will keep coming.

1821
01:50:07,858 --> 01:50:08,817
Let them come.

1822
01:50:09,025 --> 01:50:10,608
They want you dead.

1823
01:50:11,692 --> 01:50:13,275
If you want to show them
who you are,

1824
01:50:13,775 --> 01:50:15,092
just tell everything
in the court tomorrow.

1825
01:50:15,192 --> 01:50:16,358
Huh! Court?

1826
01:50:18,858 --> 01:50:19,858
It is the CM.

1827
01:50:20,234 --> 01:50:22,025
They will be out of this case
in a second.

1828
01:50:22,775 --> 01:50:24,150
You don’t know anything.

1829
01:50:24,483 --> 01:50:26,441
Why? Has this never happened
before?

1830
01:50:28,234 --> 01:50:32,150
Do you know how many CMs and PMs
were locked up before?

1831
01:50:34,234 --> 01:50:35,900
Just tell in court for once.

1832
01:50:37,650 --> 01:50:38,983
Stand for justice.

1833
01:50:39,566 --> 01:50:42,234
It will be a penance
for every crime you did.

1834
01:50:46,983 --> 01:50:48,441
Everything depends on your
brought up right?

1835
01:50:52,650 --> 01:50:55,608
I too should have had a family
like you.

1836
01:50:57,441 --> 01:50:59,983
There was no one to tell me
what was right and what was wrong.

1837
01:51:00,775 --> 01:51:03,067
I grew up thinking that
what I did was right.

1838
01:51:11,983 --> 01:51:13,441
How was the food?

1839
01:51:13,733 --> 01:51:15,150
You did give the gift money right?

1840
01:51:15,234 --> 01:51:16,383
Reception was huge.

1841
01:51:16,483 --> 01:51:17,483
Raju, come!

1842
01:51:17,942 --> 01:51:19,817
I'm very happy that you came.

1843
01:51:20,900 --> 01:51:21,817
Hey Revathi!

1844
01:51:24,109 --> 01:51:25,025
I feel very happy.

1845
01:51:25,358 --> 01:51:26,358
Why are you here?

1846
01:51:27,858 --> 01:51:29,234
Mangalam Aunty.

1847
01:51:29,983 --> 01:51:31,109
Aunty?
-Yes.

1848
01:51:31,733 --> 01:51:32,733
Oh my!

1849
01:51:33,316 --> 01:51:36,275
Er…Is…Is this our wedding?
-Yes.

1850
01:51:36,692 --> 01:51:38,733
Yes! That is why I came here.

1851
01:51:39,067 --> 01:51:41,817
Your father said that you were
getting married in Thirupathi today?

1852
01:51:42,692 --> 01:51:44,050
That…
-Revathi where are you going?

1853
01:51:44,150 --> 01:51:46,900
-You come here even during your wedding.
-Come on, there is no time.

1854
01:51:47,025 --> 01:51:48,775
Aunty…
I’m so happy! Come, come!

1855
01:51:48,983 --> 01:51:52,109
-Why didn’t your father come?
-Ah…he’s angry on you.

1856
01:51:52,400 --> 01:51:54,067
Raju, come fast.

1857
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:55,525
Hey stop kidding, come!

1858
01:52:01,150 --> 01:52:03,067
Look, saris and jewellery
are here.

1859
01:52:03,150 --> 01:52:04,925
There is everything. Get ready soon.
-I don’t want, aunty!

1860
01:52:05,025 --> 01:52:06,692
Ah…listen to me.

1861
01:52:06,817 --> 01:52:09,275
Listen to me.
Wear all these and come soon.

1862
01:52:09,525 --> 01:52:11,400
Why is your father angry with me?

1863
01:52:11,900 --> 01:52:13,900
I shall speak with him.
-Aunty it is not you but me…

1864
01:52:15,566 --> 01:52:16,525
Oh my!

1865
01:52:17,192 --> 01:52:18,900
Are you done serving the sambar?
Now drink.

1866
01:52:20,316 --> 01:52:21,525
Hello?
-Brother!

1867
01:52:21,650 --> 01:52:23,316
Why are you angry on me?

1868
01:52:23,525 --> 01:52:24,733
What did I do?

1869
01:52:24,900 --> 01:52:26,234
Why am I angry on you, Mangalam?

1870
01:52:26,275 --> 01:52:27,316
I know everything.

1871
01:52:27,692 --> 01:52:28,900
Revathi told me.

1872
01:52:29,109 --> 01:52:30,192
Revathi?

1873
01:52:30,234 --> 01:52:31,900
Did she talk to you??
When?

1874
01:52:31,983 --> 01:52:33,009
Just now she told me everything.

1875
01:52:33,109 --> 01:52:33,925
Where?

1876
01:52:34,025 --> 01:52:35,650
Here in our family’s wedding.

1877
01:52:35,858 --> 01:52:38,692
You lied to us
about Revathi’s wedding right?

1878
01:52:38,900 --> 01:52:40,109
I didn’t lie to you, dear.

1879
01:52:40,192 --> 01:52:41,425
She was the one who is lying
to you.

1880
01:52:41,525 --> 01:52:42,900
She eloped from her wedding.

1881
01:52:42,983 --> 01:52:43,942
Eloped?

1882
01:52:44,150 --> 01:52:46,316
Don't let her go anywhere.
I'm starting right away.

1883
01:52:46,942 --> 01:52:48,900
We have found Revathi.
Let’s go.

1884
01:52:49,400 --> 01:52:50,942
We can eat later, come on.

1885
01:52:51,150 --> 01:52:53,025
Yo! Son-in-law it’s getting late!

1886
01:52:53,109 --> 01:52:54,192
Bi-lingual.

1887
01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:56,109
Yeah I shall take care.

1888
01:52:56,358 --> 01:52:58,067
No matter what language you speak,

1889
01:52:58,692 --> 01:53:01,025
Please bring the girl to me sir.
-He's my brother, never gives me heroine.

1890
01:53:02,025 --> 01:53:03,192
Bring me the sambar.

1891
01:53:03,650 --> 01:53:05,192
What? Get me the sambar

1892
01:53:07,025 --> 01:53:08,067
What’s this?

1893
01:53:15,400 --> 01:53:17,025
Aunty, I will kill you.

1894
01:53:22,150 --> 01:53:23,234
Geetha! Had food?

1895
01:53:23,358 --> 01:53:25,109
What about you?
I’m done!

1896
01:53:25,692 --> 01:53:26,858
Hey, come, come!

1897
01:53:29,483 --> 01:53:30,983
“My dear Rukmani,”

1898
01:53:31,316 --> 01:53:33,025
“My sweet doe-eyed beauty”

1899
01:53:33,358 --> 01:53:36,692
“Are you the pure gold?”

1900
01:53:37,316 --> 01:53:39,150
“Forged by Lord Brahma himself?”

1901
01:53:39,400 --> 01:53:41,109
“You damsel with intoxicating eyes”

1902
01:53:41,400 --> 01:53:44,900
“I am giddy with your thoughts”

1903
01:53:45,234 --> 01:53:48,942
“Don’t you stick to my heart
and kill me.”

1904
01:53:49,150 --> 01:53:52,692
“What spell did you cast
over me?”

1905
01:53:52,983 --> 01:53:54,817
“I have come running behind you.”

1906
01:53:55,025 --> 01:53:56,942
“You are gambling with
your antics at me”

1907
01:53:57,150 --> 01:54:00,692
“You are my fortunate lover.”

1908
01:54:00,983 --> 01:54:04,900
“You are simply bundling up
my heart,”

1909
01:54:05,109 --> 01:54:08,942
“You are stealing the dream
in me”

1910
01:54:09,234 --> 01:54:12,817
“You are embracing my
little heart”

1911
01:54:13,025 --> 01:54:16,942
“With your smile you are
sowing dreams.”

1912
01:54:25,566 --> 01:54:26,483
Brother!

1913
01:54:26,650 --> 01:54:27,942
Mangala, where is Revathi?

1914
01:54:30,441 --> 01:54:31,900
Hey, have you gone mad?
Come!

1915
01:54:33,817 --> 01:54:35,983
-She's upstairs in the room.
-Hey, let's go.

1916
01:54:37,525 --> 01:54:40,275
What are you doing here?
Come fast!.

1917
01:54:41,067 --> 01:54:44,733
“Don’t stretch your arms and
legs over me”

1918
01:54:44,942 --> 01:54:48,608
“Don’t you play me like a game.”

1919
01:54:48,942 --> 01:54:50,566
“Even when my eyes are closed”

1920
01:54:50,733 --> 01:54:52,650
“My dreams shall only show you”

1921
01:54:52,858 --> 01:54:56,858
“So don’t you ask me to
leave hungry.”

1922
01:54:57,067 --> 01:55:00,900
“You can never be cheated
by others”

1923
01:55:00,983 --> 01:55:04,817
“Because they become a clown before you”
-Dad! Take your hand off me!

1924
01:55:04,983 --> 01:55:06,692
“You are my gold”

1925
01:55:06,900 --> 01:55:08,566
“I will take you away”

1926
01:55:08,817 --> 01:55:12,275
“And soften you secretly”

1927
01:55:13,109 --> 01:55:16,900
“You are simply bundling up
my heart,”

1928
01:55:17,109 --> 01:55:20,900
“You are stealing the dream
in me”

1929
01:55:21,109 --> 01:55:24,817
“You are embracing my
little heart”

1930
01:55:25,025 --> 01:55:29,192
“With your smile you are
sowing dreams.”

1931
01:55:29,817 --> 01:55:30,692
Come!

1932
01:55:32,483 --> 01:55:35,400
Look there, he is taking away
the girl again.

1933
01:55:35,483 --> 01:55:36,942
Superman!
-Oh no!

1934
01:55:38,983 --> 01:55:41,275
Is everything okay?
Be alert.

1935
01:55:44,983 --> 01:55:45,983
-Raju?
What happened?

1936
01:55:46,025 --> 01:55:46,900
Where is Raju?

1937
01:55:47,067 --> 01:55:48,441
I am wondering the same.

1938
01:55:48,525 --> 01:55:49,441
Where is Raju?

1939
01:55:53,316 --> 01:55:54,316
I trusted him!

1940
01:55:54,942 --> 01:55:56,109
Where did he go?

1941
01:56:00,566 --> 01:56:04,316
[indistinct voices]

1942
01:56:06,234 --> 01:56:07,341
What is happening here Varghese?

1943
01:56:07,441 --> 01:56:10,358
Ah…Sir, I spoke with that
military officer.

1944
01:56:10,692 --> 01:56:14,025
Constable Shiva is bringing
that Raju here.

1945
01:56:14,441 --> 01:56:15,150
Varghese! .

1946
01:56:15,234 --> 01:56:19,275
This is a very, very, very sensitive
case where CM is involved

1947
01:56:19,525 --> 01:56:22,858
If they don’t come to court tomorrow,
that will be huge disgrace to department.

1948
01:56:22,942 --> 01:56:23,817
Sir!

1949
01:56:24,067 --> 01:56:26,883
If we send some extra force there…

1950
01:56:26,983 --> 01:56:28,275
Where to send extra force, Varghese?

1951
01:56:28,316 --> 01:56:29,983
Already we have lost
a lot of people.

1952
01:56:30,441 --> 01:56:32,358
Ranjit is no more and
so is George.

1953
01:56:32,566 --> 01:56:33,608
I’m losing hoping.

1954
01:56:34,192 --> 01:56:36,900
We have to somehow find them.

1955
01:56:37,109 --> 01:56:39,067
Know their location as early
as possible.

1956
01:56:39,358 --> 01:56:40,441
Fast!
-Okay, sir!

1957
01:56:43,900 --> 01:56:45,316
Ah…Shiva!

1958
01:56:48,441 --> 01:56:49,650
It is all because of you.

1959
01:56:50,192 --> 01:56:52,775
If you hadn’t come with us, all these
problems would never have happened.

1960
01:56:52,817 --> 01:56:53,566
Damn!

1961
01:56:54,817 --> 01:56:57,733
Yes, there wouldn’t have been
these problems.

1962
01:56:58,441 --> 01:57:00,566
But I would’ve been married
to that Prem.

1963
01:57:00,775 --> 01:57:02,441
You could have married him.
Huh?

1964
01:57:03,275 --> 01:57:04,983
Instead you came here
and spoiled everything.

1965
01:57:06,275 --> 01:57:07,733
So if I had married him,

1966
01:57:08,733 --> 01:57:10,067
you would have had no issues.

1967
01:57:10,608 --> 01:57:11,566
Isn’t it?

1968
01:57:12,983 --> 01:57:14,192
-Hey?
-Stop the vehicle Shiva.

1969
01:57:14,608 --> 01:57:15,692
Revathi, keep quiet.

1970
01:57:15,983 --> 01:57:17,358
Stop the vehicle Shiva.

1971
01:57:17,358 --> 01:57:18,983
Hey Revathi, please keep quiet.

1972
01:57:19,316 --> 01:57:20,983
Stop the vehicle or else I’ll…
-Revathi, be quiet.

1973
01:57:21,067 --> 01:57:22,692
Are you mad?
Close the door.

1974
01:57:23,733 --> 01:57:25,316
I am telling you, close the door.
-Leave my hand.

1975
01:57:25,483 --> 01:57:27,050
Revathi close the door.

1976
01:57:27,150 --> 01:57:28,150
Take your hand off me!

1977
01:57:29,025 --> 01:57:30,025
Stop the vehicle!

1978
01:57:32,400 --> 01:57:33,275
Revathi!

1979
01:57:34,650 --> 01:57:35,608
Revathi!

1980
01:57:38,692 --> 01:57:39,608
Ah!!!

1981
01:57:53,483 --> 01:57:54,441
Sorry!

1982
01:57:55,441 --> 01:57:56,858
I shouldn’t have spoken like that.

1983
01:58:00,775 --> 01:58:01,900
Don’t you know?

1984
01:58:03,817 --> 01:58:05,109
This is my brother’s dream.

1985
01:58:07,316 --> 01:58:09,316
He wanted to become a police
and do service to people.

1986
01:58:10,316 --> 01:58:12,441
I became a police to fulfil
his dream.

1987
01:58:12,733 --> 01:58:13,983
Now look what happened?

1988
01:58:14,234 --> 01:58:17,858
I hit that inspector and many
others and brought Raju along.

1989
01:58:18,400 --> 01:58:19,650
But now he is missing.

1990
01:58:20,858 --> 01:58:22,316
Can I go back to our town?

1991
01:58:24,316 --> 01:58:26,275
Even if I go there,
will I get my job back?

1992
01:58:30,525 --> 01:58:31,525
Mom, dad…

1993
01:58:32,525 --> 01:58:33,525
and sister…

1994
01:58:34,566 --> 01:58:36,192
I even don’t know,
where are they?

1995
01:58:38,275 --> 01:58:39,858
I spoke out of tension.

1996
01:58:42,483 --> 01:58:43,316
Listen!

1997
01:58:45,692 --> 01:58:48,275
What I like the most in you is
your stubbornness.

1998
01:58:49,192 --> 01:58:51,316
If you set your mind to
finish something,

1999
01:58:51,858 --> 01:58:53,525
You will never stop till you
get it done.

2000
01:58:54,067 --> 01:58:56,608
That hope made me
to fall in love with you.

2001
01:58:57,358 --> 01:58:58,483
Not only in this issue,

2002
01:58:58,900 --> 01:59:00,275
no matter what,

2003
01:59:00,692 --> 01:59:01,983
I shall never leave you.

2004
01:59:03,150 --> 01:59:04,650
I love you so much.

2005
01:59:05,525 --> 01:59:06,566
Please forgive me.

2006
01:59:08,441 --> 01:59:11,150
The moment you came
and sat beside me,

2007
01:59:11,483 --> 01:59:12,817
I fell in love with you.

2008
01:59:22,650 --> 01:59:23,900
Shiva…
-Hmm.

2009
01:59:24,358 --> 01:59:26,400
I am a little hungry.

2010
01:59:27,025 --> 01:59:27,900
Okay!

2011
01:59:28,358 --> 01:59:31,025
I saw a hotel on the way.

2012
01:59:31,275 --> 01:59:32,817
Shall we have some Paratha there?

2013
01:59:34,642 --> 01:59:36,933
[indistinct voices]

2014
01:59:47,559 --> 01:59:48,267
Hello!

2015
01:59:48,308 --> 01:59:50,308
-Hey Ravi, it’s me.
-Yeah tell me!

2016
01:59:50,850 --> 01:59:52,058
Yeah tell me… tell me brother?

2017
01:59:52,100 --> 01:59:53,517
Where are you?
When will you reach here?

2018
01:59:53,559 --> 01:59:55,016
I am on the way, brother!

2019
01:59:55,142 --> 01:59:57,642
-Where are you?
-I…I am inside the exhibition.

2020
01:59:57,933 --> 02:00:00,708
There is a stage behind a ride.
I am standing there, come fast.

2021
02:00:00,808 --> 02:00:02,392
Ah! Okay brother,
I shall be there.

2022
02:00:08,642 --> 02:00:11,350
First keep aside your anger
and then think calmly.

2023
02:00:12,100 --> 02:00:13,975
You cannot understand anything
in rage.

2024
02:00:14,308 --> 02:00:15,517
He is injured,

2025
02:00:16,725 --> 02:00:18,100
so he could not go far.

2026
02:00:18,559 --> 02:00:20,350
There will be police everywhere.

2027
02:00:20,725 --> 02:00:21,975
Where would he have gone?

2028
02:00:23,183 --> 02:00:25,225
He definitely needs someone
to help him.

2029
02:00:25,392 --> 02:00:27,684
Then, where will he ask him
to come?

2030
02:00:28,058 --> 02:00:31,392
The exhibition that is happening at
Amar grounds will conclude tomorrow.

2031
02:00:31,684 --> 02:00:34,142
We request everybody to come
and enjoy the show.

2032
02:00:34,392 --> 02:00:36,058
Brother, one Kothu Parotta!

2033
02:00:38,016 --> 02:00:40,891
[indistinct voices]

2034
02:00:41,475 --> 02:00:42,975
Will he definitely be here?

2035
02:00:43,100 --> 02:00:44,684
I don’t know where he will
be here.

2036
02:00:45,600 --> 02:00:46,975
But we have no other option.

2037
02:00:47,559 --> 02:00:49,684
So we have to search
and he will be somewhere here.

2038
02:01:09,642 --> 02:01:11,016
Hey Raju!
-Where?

2039
02:01:17,850 --> 02:01:18,933
You go that side.

2040
02:01:24,975 --> 02:01:26,433
Shiva… there!

2041
02:01:33,891 --> 02:01:35,392
Raju, stop there.

2042
02:01:35,600 --> 02:01:36,559
Raju!

2043
02:01:36,975 --> 02:01:39,891
I trusted you and released your
handcuff. But you deceived us.

2044
02:01:40,517 --> 02:01:41,891
Hey!
-Shiva!

2045
02:01:42,100 --> 02:01:44,600
If we stay here together,
then they will kill us both.

2046
02:01:45,225 --> 02:01:46,891
How are we going to escape?
Leave me and go. -Shiva!

2047
02:01:46,933 --> 02:01:48,433
Hey! Where should I go?

2048
02:01:48,475 --> 02:01:50,891
Where do you want me to go?
Should I go to police who I hit?

2049
02:01:50,975 --> 02:01:54,016
Or should I go to my father to whom I
promised to avenge my brother’s death?

2050
02:01:54,267 --> 02:01:57,559
Hey! I will either submit you at
the court… Or I shall die trying.

2051
02:01:57,725 --> 02:01:58,642
Shiva!

2052
02:01:59,766 --> 02:02:01,725
I know both of you are here.

2053
02:02:03,350 --> 02:02:04,267
Enough…

2054
02:02:04,600 --> 02:02:05,891
enough of this cat
and mouse game.

2055
02:02:05,975 --> 02:02:06,850
He is here.

2056
02:02:07,058 --> 02:02:08,183
Don’t be here, go now.

2057
02:02:08,350 --> 02:02:10,933
One of your friends is here
to meet you.

2058
02:02:11,517 --> 02:02:12,850
I am leaving Shiva,
listen to me now.

2059
02:02:12,933 --> 02:02:15,267
Hand over Raju
and take him with you.

2060
02:02:18,392 --> 02:02:20,142
-Hey Shiva, listen to me.
-No Shiva.

2061
02:02:21,225 --> 02:02:22,850
Listen to what he says Shiva.
-Hey!

2062
02:02:36,891 --> 02:02:38,600
Dad! Dad!
-Shiva don’t go.

2063
02:02:38,808 --> 02:02:40,891
Ask Shiva to bring Raju here.
-Please don’t go!

2064
02:02:41,308 --> 02:02:43,517
I shall spare his life then.

2065
02:02:43,725 --> 02:02:44,642
Or else…

2066
02:02:44,933 --> 02:02:45,766
Ask him to come.

2067
02:02:45,891 --> 02:02:46,850
Dad… Dad.

2068
02:02:47,016 --> 02:02:48,875
He will not do anything,
listen to me. -He has a gun.

2069
02:02:48,975 --> 02:02:50,766
Trust me he will not do
anything to your father. -Call him!

2070
02:02:51,392 --> 02:02:53,600
No Shiva, don’t come out.

2071
02:02:54,350 --> 02:02:56,016
Truth alone should come out.

2072
02:02:56,642 --> 02:02:57,808
Why is he talking now?

2073
02:02:57,975 --> 02:03:00,766
All the victims who died along with your
brother, must get justice they deserve.

2074
02:03:01,058 --> 02:03:02,058
You leave now.

2075
02:03:02,100 --> 02:03:03,225
Hey…Hey Shiva!

2076
02:03:03,433 --> 02:03:04,933
You father has gone mad.

2077
02:03:05,142 --> 02:03:06,684
I have kept the gun at point
blank range.

2078
02:03:06,891 --> 02:03:07,891
-Dad!
-He will not do anything.

2079
02:03:07,975 --> 02:03:09,167
-Dad! Dad!
-If you want your Dad…

2080
02:03:09,267 --> 02:03:10,975
Leave him
and take your father with you.

2081
02:03:12,142 --> 02:03:13,125
Come on!
-Dad.

2082
02:03:13,225 --> 02:03:14,183
-He will not do anything.
-Dad!

2083
02:03:14,308 --> 02:03:15,600
You should not come Shiva!

2084
02:03:15,642 --> 02:03:16,725
You have taken an oath.

2085
02:03:16,808 --> 02:03:18,183
You have taken oath over
your uniform. -Hey!

2086
02:03:18,225 --> 02:03:19,725
I have taken many such oaths.

2087
02:03:19,933 --> 02:03:21,975
Shiva, what is important to you?

2088
02:03:22,183 --> 02:03:24,100
Your dad or taking Raju to
the court?

2089
02:03:24,225 --> 02:03:25,584
Just listen, he is trying to
kill us. -Dad! Dad!

2090
02:03:25,684 --> 02:03:26,766
You decide for yourself.

2091
02:03:26,891 --> 02:03:27,933
I will count till 10.

2092
02:03:28,016 --> 02:03:28,891
What can you do?

2093
02:03:28,975 --> 02:03:30,350
Are you going to kill me?
Go ahead!

2094
02:03:30,392 --> 02:03:31,167
I will kill you for sure.

2095
02:03:31,267 --> 02:03:32,100
Go ahead, kill me.

2096
02:03:32,475 --> 02:03:36,517
At such a young age,
my son is fighting against death,

2097
02:03:36,933 --> 02:03:39,475
then why an old man like me
should fear you?

2098
02:03:39,725 --> 02:03:40,850
He will not do anything to
your father. -Dad!

2099
02:03:40,933 --> 02:03:41,808
Shiva!

2100
02:03:41,933 --> 02:03:44,808
You should not fail because of me.
-Hey Shiva!!

2101
02:03:44,975 --> 02:03:46,808
-Wait, nothing will happen.
-Dad! Leave me.

2102
02:03:46,933 --> 02:03:48,433
If you don’t bring out Raju…

2103
02:03:55,766 --> 02:03:56,642
Dad!

2104
02:03:58,016 --> 02:04:01,225
“Did you leave to sojourn
the sky?”

2105
02:04:01,475 --> 02:04:03,267
“Dad, my Dad!”
-Leave me!

2106
02:04:04,183 --> 02:04:04,933
Dad!

2107
02:04:06,225 --> 02:04:07,183
Shiva!

2108
02:04:07,308 --> 02:04:11,183
“Did you end your life that
you lived?” -Hey!

2109
02:04:11,350 --> 02:04:13,433
“Dad, my Dad!”

2110
02:04:17,350 --> 02:04:20,475
“You found your end”

2111
02:04:21,350 --> 02:04:23,766
“But you abandoned me”

2112
02:04:26,016 --> 02:04:27,559
Brother, come on.

2113
02:04:28,308 --> 02:04:29,142
Get in.

2114
02:04:29,225 --> 02:04:32,183
“My heart is crying out”
-Brother!

2115
02:04:32,433 --> 02:04:34,559
Brother come in. Come!
-“My heart is burning”

2116
02:04:36,808 --> 02:04:39,850
“It cries out searching for you”
-Dad! Dad!

2117
02:04:40,766 --> 02:04:43,016
“I cannot bear this”
-Dad!

2118
02:04:43,183 --> 02:04:44,642
Leave me!

2119
02:04:45,183 --> 02:04:46,225
Dad!

2120
02:04:46,766 --> 02:04:50,058
“If someone does something wrong”
-Let’s go!

2121
02:04:50,725 --> 02:04:54,933
“We would complain him to the king”

2122
02:04:58,475 --> 02:05:01,808
“If someone does something wrong”

2123
02:05:02,475 --> 02:05:05,975
“We would complain him to the king”

2124
02:05:06,308 --> 02:05:09,891
“If the king is a murderer”

2125
02:05:10,100 --> 02:05:14,766
“Then where can we go and complain?”

2126
02:05:16,058 --> 02:05:19,350
“My heart is crying out”

2127
02:05:19,975 --> 02:05:23,100
“My heart is burning”

2128
02:05:23,891 --> 02:05:27,142
“It cries out searching for you”

2129
02:05:27,766 --> 02:05:30,808
“I cannot bear this”

2130
02:05:31,559 --> 02:05:34,517
“I cannot bear this”

2131
02:05:35,517 --> 02:05:36,850
There is money in that bag.

2132
02:05:37,350 --> 02:05:38,808
Take that, go somewhere and live.

2133
02:05:40,975 --> 02:05:43,642
If you keep preaching
about justice and honesty,

2134
02:05:43,725 --> 02:05:45,642
they will first kill you and
then her.

2135
02:05:46,308 --> 02:05:47,392
What are you looking at?

2136
02:05:47,891 --> 02:05:49,600
I didn’t kill his father.

2137
02:05:50,183 --> 02:05:51,975
That is not my fault but yours.

2138
02:05:52,308 --> 02:05:54,100
I told you not to come with me.

2139
02:05:55,933 --> 02:05:57,016
You explain things to him.

2140
02:05:58,684 --> 02:06:00,308
Tell him to live along with people.

2141
02:06:00,600 --> 02:06:01,642
People!

2142
02:06:02,433 --> 02:06:03,267
Okay?

2143
02:06:04,517 --> 02:06:06,475
Take that money
and settle in some place.

2144
02:06:08,308 --> 02:06:09,475
Invite me for your wedding.

2145
02:06:09,766 --> 02:06:11,225
I shall come and feast on biryani.

2146
02:06:19,392 --> 02:06:20,975
They said that whoever kills Raju…

2147
02:06:21,225 --> 02:06:22,891
will become the next Raju.

2148
02:06:24,392 --> 02:06:29,600
I know you will be happy if I become
Raju, instead of some random guy.

2149
02:06:30,392 --> 02:06:31,891
Why did you stab me here?

2150
02:06:32,684 --> 02:06:34,308
Isn’t the liver on the right side?

2151
02:06:36,933 --> 02:06:37,766
Shiva!

2152
02:06:38,225 --> 02:06:41,183
You have to stab like this.
Right side, right side!

2153
02:06:42,559 --> 02:06:44,292
Shiva, please don’t go.

2154
02:06:44,392 --> 02:06:46,058
You don’t even know where to stab.

2155
02:06:46,975 --> 02:06:48,808
How can you become the next Razu?

2156
02:06:54,142 --> 02:06:54,958
-Revathi leave me.
-Shiva…

2157
02:06:55,058 --> 02:06:56,392
-I am telling you, right?
Let me go. -No Shiva.

2158
02:06:59,600 --> 02:07:00,433
Hey!

2159
02:07:01,100 --> 02:07:02,183
Shiva!

2160
02:07:04,684 --> 02:07:06,267
Raju, come!
Let’s go!

2161
02:07:13,808 --> 02:07:15,725
We need to go from here!

2162
02:07:24,433 --> 02:07:26,642
Revathi….Revathi…

2163
02:07:34,559 --> 02:07:35,559
Hey, Shiva!

2164
02:07:37,684 --> 02:07:39,475
Raju, Raju, come!
-Don’t let them go!

2165
02:07:39,808 --> 02:07:41,016
Come! Revathi, come!

2166
02:07:46,016 --> 02:07:47,559
Come, get in the train!

2167
02:07:50,225 --> 02:07:51,642
Revathi.. Come on!

2168
02:07:53,975 --> 02:07:55,350
Raju, don’t stop. Go!

2169
02:08:10,100 --> 02:08:12,100
You were saying that
your brother would come.

2170
02:08:14,267 --> 02:08:15,183
He came.

2171
02:08:16,058 --> 02:08:17,016
What happened now?

2172
02:08:18,975 --> 02:08:20,891
No one is loyal around you.

2173
02:08:22,600 --> 02:08:24,225
The life that you lived was
a lie.

2174
02:08:28,433 --> 02:08:30,808
What did you say? You said we
cannot even go beyond our town.

2175
02:08:32,933 --> 02:08:34,975
But now look where we are.

2176
02:08:36,684 --> 02:08:37,808
Truth will triumph.

2177
02:08:38,684 --> 02:08:39,684
It might take some time.

2178
02:08:40,725 --> 02:08:42,016
But it shall definitely triumph.

2179
02:08:44,684 --> 02:08:47,225
You said that my father’s death
will not come under your list.

2180
02:08:48,183 --> 02:08:49,808
It is right, it will not.

2181
02:08:51,642 --> 02:08:53,559
But do you know why he died?

2182
02:08:55,183 --> 02:08:57,058
He died so the truth could
come to light.

2183
02:09:03,559 --> 02:09:05,267
Try standing beside truth
for once.

2184
02:09:08,100 --> 02:09:09,183
Your life will change.

2185
02:09:13,725 --> 02:09:15,642
Shiva…Shiva listen to me.

2186
02:09:18,433 --> 02:09:20,183
Shiva even now I am telling you.
Just surrender.

2187
02:09:28,475 --> 02:09:29,433
Hey!

2188
02:09:30,933 --> 02:09:32,142
Revathi! Take the weapon!

2189
02:09:39,684 --> 02:09:40,750
Revathi, Revathi!

2190
02:09:40,850 --> 02:09:42,350
Revathi! Go to the engine.

2191
02:09:42,808 --> 02:09:44,250
This train shouldn’t stop anywhere.

2192
02:09:44,350 --> 02:09:45,684
Do you get it?
-How can I, Shiva?

2193
02:09:45,766 --> 02:09:47,933
Revathi! We have to do this
as we don’t have any options left!

2194
02:09:48,142 --> 02:09:50,725
You have a gun in your hand.
Use the gun if necessary.

2195
02:09:50,766 --> 02:09:53,225
But the train shouldn’t stop
at any station. Go, Revathi. Go!

2196
02:09:53,475 --> 02:09:55,933
We will get off
wherever the train slows down.

2197
02:10:17,183 --> 02:10:19,142
Double crossing over, next stage!

2198
02:10:19,183 --> 02:10:21,016
Put the walkie down.
-Ah?

2199
02:10:21,142 --> 02:10:22,600
If I shoot your head would explode.

2200
02:10:24,891 --> 02:10:26,808
Go fast….Go fast!
-Okay, okay!

2201
02:10:33,891 --> 02:10:35,517
Go fast!
Even faster, go fast.

2202
02:10:35,559 --> 02:10:37,225
I am doing it, madam.

2203
02:10:59,225 --> 02:11:01,225
Raju! Come, come…

2204
02:11:16,975 --> 02:11:17,850
Get in!

2205
02:11:20,725 --> 02:11:21,642
Hey!

2206
02:11:22,600 --> 02:11:23,808
Close it, close it!

2207
02:12:44,559 --> 02:12:45,475
Hey!

2208
02:13:06,808 --> 02:13:07,684
Hey!

2209
02:13:19,725 --> 02:13:20,559
Hey!

2210
02:14:14,642 --> 02:14:16,517
Raju, get up!
Come, let’s go!

2211
02:14:17,975 --> 02:14:19,308
Raju! Come.
-I will not spare you.

2212
02:14:19,684 --> 02:14:20,766
Come. Let’s get to the engine.

2213
02:14:21,891 --> 02:14:22,850
Come, come!

2214
02:14:23,392 --> 02:14:24,308
Come fast!

2215
02:14:27,308 --> 02:14:28,225
Raju!

2216
02:14:29,600 --> 02:14:30,517
Raju!

2217
02:14:30,559 --> 02:14:32,183
Raju! Listen to me!
Come, come

2218
02:14:33,933 --> 02:14:35,183
Raju! Raju…

2219
02:14:36,142 --> 02:14:38,267
Raju! Give me your hand.
Come, come.

2220
02:14:38,933 --> 02:14:40,559
Hey! Listen to me! Come!

2221
02:14:42,225 --> 02:14:43,225
Raju! Come.

2222
02:14:43,559 --> 02:14:44,600
Listen to me! Come!

2223
02:14:47,766 --> 02:14:48,642
Hey!

2224
02:14:50,850 --> 02:14:52,725
Hey, Raju! What are you doing?

2225
02:14:53,308 --> 02:14:55,350
Raju! What are you doing?
Raju…

2226
02:14:56,475 --> 02:14:58,225
Hey, hey!

2227
02:14:58,850 --> 02:14:59,850
Hey! Raju…

2228
02:15:00,433 --> 02:15:02,308
Raju, what are you up to?

2229
02:15:03,183 --> 02:15:05,308
Hey, hey! Stop the train!

2230
02:15:06,308 --> 02:15:08,100
Hey, hey!

2231
02:15:11,725 --> 02:15:13,183
Raju, what are you up to?

2232
02:15:14,183 --> 02:15:15,891
Raju, what are you up to??
Damn!

2233
02:15:20,975 --> 02:15:21,933
What Raju,

2234
02:15:22,433 --> 02:15:23,725
if you were in my place…

2235
02:15:24,725 --> 02:15:26,308
You too would have done
the same thing right?

2236
02:15:28,850 --> 02:15:30,433
Surely I wouldn’t have done
like this.

2237
02:15:33,225 --> 02:15:34,891
I wouldn’t have suffered so much.

2238
02:15:37,058 --> 02:15:39,142
I would have killed you
the very next minute.

2239
02:15:40,559 --> 02:15:41,850
Do you have a match box?

2240
02:15:46,267 --> 02:15:47,267
Hey…

2241
02:15:47,808 --> 02:15:49,808
Raju…Raju…

2242
02:15:53,433 --> 02:15:54,475
Raju!

2243
02:16:07,475 --> 02:16:10,100
-Hail to!
-Tamil warrior lady, Drakshayani!

2244
02:16:10,308 --> 02:16:13,350
-Hail to!
-Brave lady, Drakshayani!

2245
02:16:13,808 --> 02:16:16,058
-Hail to!
-Jhansi Rani, Drakshayani!

2246
02:16:16,392 --> 02:16:19,100
-Hail to!
-CM forever, Drakshayani!

2247
02:16:19,308 --> 02:16:21,850
-Hail to!
-Goddess of loyalty, Drakshayani!

2248
02:16:22,058 --> 02:16:24,308
-Hail to!
-Golden star, Drakshayani!

2249
02:16:31,725 --> 02:16:32,766
You may proceed!

2250
02:16:33,016 --> 02:16:34,016
Your honour,

2251
02:16:34,267 --> 02:16:37,433
as CBI didn’t produce witnesses
even in this adjournment,

2252
02:16:37,517 --> 02:16:43,058
it is clear that CM's name was
intentionally induced into this case.

2253
02:16:43,142 --> 02:16:47,016
Thus, I request the Court
to dismiss this case.

2254
02:16:47,559 --> 02:16:49,142
You're honour, witness is here.

2255
02:16:49,517 --> 02:16:51,058
We are presenting now.

2256
02:16:51,475 --> 02:16:52,600
With your permission.

2257
02:16:52,725 --> 02:16:53,642
Permitted!

2258
02:17:11,725 --> 02:17:12,766
Shiva, Ma'am!

2259
02:17:26,559 --> 02:17:27,433
My lord!

2260
02:17:27,808 --> 02:17:28,933
My name is Shiva.

2261
02:17:29,142 --> 02:17:31,016
Sakhinetipalli Police Station
Constable.

2262
02:17:31,350 --> 02:17:32,808
ID number 1302.

2263
02:17:33,183 --> 02:17:35,142
On the way,
while I and CBI officer George…

2264
02:17:35,600 --> 02:17:38,850
were bringing this case witness
Raju to the court,

2265
02:17:38,933 --> 02:17:40,100
But while coming here,

2266
02:17:40,267 --> 02:17:46,267
IG Nataraj and some Police have
killed Raju and CBI officer George.

2267
02:17:46,517 --> 02:17:49,642
For that,
will you give the witness?

2268
02:17:49,725 --> 02:17:50,975
Who said I'm giving witness?

2269
02:17:51,475 --> 02:17:52,475
Raju himself will tell.

2270
02:17:52,559 --> 02:17:54,267
You said, they killed him right?

2271
02:17:54,642 --> 02:17:56,517
Will he come alive and
give witness?

2272
02:17:56,808 --> 02:17:57,684
He will.

2273
02:17:57,766 --> 02:17:59,725
Train shouldn't stop here.
Go, be courageous.

2274
02:17:59,808 --> 02:18:01,333
Go Revathi, go!

2275
02:18:01,433 --> 02:18:03,016
Hey listen, keep the camera inside.

2276
02:18:03,225 --> 02:18:05,600
Hey listen to me.
I think there is some problem.

2277
02:18:05,808 --> 02:18:07,475
Keep the camera inside.
Are you a big reporter?

2278
02:18:07,517 --> 02:18:08,891
Listen to me and keep it inside

2279
02:18:19,559 --> 02:18:20,475
What is this?

2280
02:18:20,559 --> 02:18:22,517
Sorry ma’am! Sorry!
One minute! Sorry ma’am!

2281
02:18:33,725 --> 02:18:35,058
Shiva, is this okay?

2282
02:18:35,433 --> 02:18:36,933
Yeah! Okay, ready.

2283
02:18:37,433 --> 02:18:38,891
Good day to you all.

2284
02:18:39,475 --> 02:18:41,058
My name is Rajashekar.

2285
02:18:41,684 --> 02:18:42,850
Razu.

2286
02:18:44,308 --> 02:18:46,600
If you’re seeing me in this video.

2287
02:18:47,016 --> 02:18:50,475
instead of directly saying, it
means CM already got me killed.

2288
02:18:51,559 --> 02:18:52,933
CM has killed me.

2289
02:18:54,933 --> 02:18:56,225
I wish to many facts with you.

2290
02:18:57,183 --> 02:18:58,975
-Do I say like this?
-Yes, go on!

2291
02:18:59,766 --> 02:19:05,517
Almost 40 died a few years ago, in
gas blast accident at Morampudi junction.

2292
02:19:08,100 --> 02:19:09,267
That was really an accident.

2293
02:19:09,475 --> 02:19:12,517
To make IAS officer Radhakrishna's
dead body disappear

2294
02:19:12,850 --> 02:19:16,433
IG Natraj and I planned this to hide
murder of IAS officer Radhakrishnan.

2295
02:19:17,267 --> 02:19:21,684
IAS officer finding out CM’s mistakes
and illegal activities, questioned her.

2296
02:19:21,975 --> 02:19:23,225
CM killed that man.

2297
02:19:37,808 --> 02:19:44,100
We laid his body in a vehicle at
Morampudi Junction and left there.

2298
02:19:50,559 --> 02:19:53,142
CM asked me to bring it.
I did by her orders.

2299
02:19:53,308 --> 02:19:54,808
I have done many such things
for CM.

2300
02:19:56,016 --> 02:19:58,392
I did many as such for CM.

2301
02:19:58,975 --> 02:20:00,475
This is my death statement.

2302
02:20:01,766 --> 02:20:02,808
Madam?

2303
02:20:07,142 --> 02:20:08,933
The money received from
the ruling party,

2304
02:20:09,267 --> 02:20:11,850
And I also have the recording
of our phone calls.

2305
02:20:12,225 --> 02:20:13,475
I have hidden it in a place.

2306
02:20:13,559 --> 02:20:15,850
Shiva will hand over that to you.

2307
02:20:19,642 --> 02:20:21,100
Okay. Wait!
-What?

2308
02:20:21,225 --> 02:20:21,958
What?

2309
02:20:22,058 --> 02:20:24,308
-There is one more thing.
-Ok, tell.

2310
02:20:24,475 --> 02:20:31,433
I fell in love with the CM right
at the first time I saw her.

2311
02:20:32,808 --> 02:20:34,975
She has nothing to do.
Just one side!

2312
02:20:35,600 --> 02:20:37,267
I didn’t want to say this.

2313
02:20:37,684 --> 02:20:39,267
But, Revathi asked me to say this.

2314
02:20:39,808 --> 02:20:41,350
No, not me!

2315
02:20:42,475 --> 02:20:43,433
That’s it.

2316
02:20:45,100 --> 02:20:46,058
Thanks!

2317
02:20:56,808 --> 02:21:03,850
Since Raju, the important witness of CBI
in this case, could not come to the court.

2318
02:21:03,933 --> 02:21:09,392
This court accepts his dying
declaration as important evidence.

2319
02:21:09,975 --> 02:21:16,642
I order the CBI to get all
the evidences mentioned by Raju,

2320
02:21:16,684 --> 02:21:20,808
From Shiva and proceed
with further investigations.

2321
02:21:20,891 --> 02:21:24,142
This court orders CBI to take
the accused,

2322
02:21:24,392 --> 02:21:29,100
The primary accused of this case,
A1, Dhatchayani,

2323
02:21:29,350 --> 02:21:34,308
A2 IG Natraj and other police officers,
who are involved in this case,

2324
02:21:34,600 --> 02:21:37,725
Must be taken into custody
for further investigation.

2325
02:21:37,933 --> 02:21:44,642
This court orders the CBI to produce
final report, within the next 21 days.

2326
02:21:48,559 --> 02:21:49,975
The court is adjourned!

2327
02:21:59,808 --> 02:22:01,933
Thank you Shiva,
you did a great job.

2328
02:22:02,267 --> 02:22:03,042
Thank you sir.

2329
02:22:03,142 --> 02:22:05,975
If you want you can join the CBI.

2330
02:22:06,142 --> 02:22:07,350
I can appoint you right away.

2331
02:22:08,933 --> 02:22:10,142
I want to be a police.

2332
02:22:11,100 --> 02:22:12,350
This is my brother’s dream.

2333
02:22:14,392 --> 02:22:15,350
Okay,

2334
02:22:15,684 --> 02:22:18,684
but you know that our doors
are always open for you.

2335
02:22:20,433 --> 02:22:21,225
Right!

2336
02:22:22,267 --> 02:22:23,183
All the best.

2337
02:22:41,792 --> 02:22:42,875
Good job, Shiva.

2338
02:22:43,125 --> 02:22:44,250
What you did is right.

2339
02:22:44,583 --> 02:22:47,458
You, me, and everyone else is
here to serve the public.

2340
02:22:47,833 --> 02:22:50,917
If it’s going to help the public,
don’t think twice to confront anyone.

2341
02:22:51,250 --> 02:22:53,875
Be it the CM or the PM.

2342
02:23:20,333 --> 02:23:21,750
Everything happened as you thought.

2343
02:23:22,333 --> 02:23:23,625
Shall we get married now?

2344
02:23:26,416 --> 02:23:28,708
She was requesting you throughout
the movie. Why don’t you marry her?

2345
02:23:28,792 --> 02:23:30,084
Audiences have to go home.

2346
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:03,375
“Jagada Jagada Jagadam
we are ready for a battle”

2347
02:24:03,542 --> 02:24:06,917
Ragada Ragada Ragadam
We shall shake it all”

2348
02:24:08,750 --> 02:24:12,625
“Let a thousand lives come, we
shall swallow death again and again”

2349
02:24:12,792 --> 02:24:16,708
“With this seething, raging poison
Our call is a drum beat”

2350
02:24:19,042 --> 02:24:22,875
“I am the king of the jungle
Sky’s the limit but I always be humble”

2351
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:24,859
“Lot of people talk about
this and that”

2352
02:24:24,959 --> 02:24:27,667
“ But…In the end they fumble”

2353
02:24:28,291 --> 02:24:31,792
“I go voice by the gate, paps follow
me as I am chilling on a break”

2354
02:24:31,917 --> 02:24:35,708
“Talk to me nice, this man don’t play man
if goes left, then it’s a little late”

2355
02:24:36,708 --> 02:24:38,875
“Talk to me nice cuz
I can boost some enterprise”

2356
02:24:39,042 --> 02:24:40,959
“Rooms flare up when I jump
on the mic”

2357
02:24:41,208 --> 02:24:43,250
“Walked on the yacht with a chica
on my right”

2358
02:24:43,375 --> 02:24:45,458
“The life I am living is
a hella pretty sight”

2359
02:24:45,792 --> 02:24:47,667
“Hey, I am so fly, you know”

2360
02:24:48,084 --> 02:24:50,042
“Life’s going so high,
how’d you know?”

2361
02:24:50,291 --> 02:24:52,375
“You never thought
I could spit fires you know”

2362
02:24:52,500 --> 02:24:54,959
“I am making the whole cry,
you know”

2363
02:24:55,042 --> 02:24:57,000
“Hey, I am so fly, you know”

2364
02:24:57,208 --> 02:24:59,291
“Life’s going so high,
how’d you know?”

2365
02:24:59,375 --> 02:25:01,291
“You never thought
I could spit fires you know”

2366
02:25:01,458 --> 02:25:03,667
“Now the whole world knows
I am style you know…”

2367
02:25:31,708 --> 02:25:35,375
“Let the sky fall
let the earth cave in”

2368
02:25:35,959 --> 02:25:39,792
“Our song still goes on, ho ho!”
