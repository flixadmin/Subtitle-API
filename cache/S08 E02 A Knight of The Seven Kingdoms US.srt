1
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:01,621
When I was a child, my brother
would tell me a bedtime story

2
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,709
about the man who murdered our father.

3
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,005
Who stabbed him in the back
and cut his throat.

4
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:13,758
Who sat down on the Iron Throne
and watched

5
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:16,052
as his blood poured onto the floor.

6
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:19,890
He told me other stories as well.

7
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,602
About all the things
we would do to that man

8
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,690
once we took back the Seven Kingdoms
and had him in our grasp.

9
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:33,194
Your sister pledged
to send her army north.

10
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,948
-She did.
-I don't see an army.

11
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:43,079
I see one man, with one hand.
It appears your sister lied to me.

12
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,542
She lied to me as well.

13
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:52,505
She never had any intention
of sending her army north.

14
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:57,177
She has Euron Greyjoy's fleet
and 20,000 fresh troops.

15
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:01,556
The Golden Company from Essos,
bought and paid for.

16
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,017
Even if we defeat the dead,

17
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,227
she'll have more than enough
to destroy the survivors.

18
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:07,228
"We"?

19
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:12,150
I promised to fight for the living.
I intend to keep that promise.

20
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,822
-Your Grace, I know my brother--
-Like you knew your sister?

21
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,370
He came here alone,
knowing full well how he'd be received.

22
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:27,207
Why would he do that
if he weren't telling the truth?

23
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,751
Perhaps, he trusts his little brother
to defend him,

24
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:32,504
right up to the moment he slits my throat.

25
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,340
You're right. We can't trust him.

26
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,927
He attacked my father in the streets.

27
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,681
He tried to destroy my house
and my family, the same as he did yours.

28
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:45,225
Do you want me to apologize?
I won't.

29
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:47,686
We were at war.

30
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:51,690
Everything I did, I did for my house
and my family. I'd do it all again.

31
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,651
The things we do for love.

32
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:04,661
So why have you abandoned
your house and family now?

33
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,165
Because this goes beyond loyalty.

34
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:13,920
This is about survival.

35
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,221
You don't know me well, Your Grace.

36
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:28,935
But I know Ser Jaime.
He is a man of honor.

37
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:31,646
I was his captor once.

38
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,316
But when we were both taken prisoner
and the men holding us

39
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,486
tried to force themselves on me,
Ser Jaime defended me.

40
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,865
And lost his hand because of it.

41
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:49,039
Without him, my lady,
you would not be alive.

42
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,042
He armed me, armored me,

43
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,586
and sent me to find you
and bring you home

44
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:57,547
because he'd sworn an oath to your mother.

45
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:05,680
You vouch for him?

46
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:09,768
I do.

47
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,441
You would fight beside him?

48
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:21,654
I would.

49
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,827
I trust you with my life.

50
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:33,208
If you trust him with yours,
we should let him stay.

51
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,174
What does the Warden of the North
say about it?

52
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:48,890
We need every man we can get.

53
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,276
Very well.

54
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:22,924
Thank you, Your Grace.

55
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,883
Either you knew Cersei was lying
and let me believe otherwise,

56
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,092
or you didn't know at all.

57
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,261
Which makes you
either a traitor or a fool.

58
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,263
-I was a fool.
-Not for the first time.

59
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,183
Cersei still sits on the throne.

60
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:17,103
If you can't help me take it back,
I'll find another Hand who can.

61
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:26,863
I suspect one of you will be
wearing this before it's all over.

62
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,162
Coal's coming through.

63
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,628
-Don't you have something better to do?
-You make my weapon yet?

64
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:28,508
Just as soon as I'm done
making a few thousand of these.

65
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:32,053
You should make mine first.
And make sure it's stronger than this.

66
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,014
It's strong enough.

67
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,854
It's going to be safer
down in the crypt, you know.

68
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:45,400
Are you going to be down in the crypt?

69
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,694
-No, but--
-But you're a fighter.

70
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,280
I've done my share.

71
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,077
-You've fought them?
-I did. Some of them.

72
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,497
-How many?
-A few.

73
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,250
That was enough.

74
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:08,214
-What are they like?
-Bad.

75
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,094
-Really bad.
-"Really bad"?

76
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:19,058
Even a smith's apprentice
can do better than "really bad."

77
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,894
What do they look like?
What do they smell like?

78
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,147
How do they move?
How hard are they to kill?

79
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,398
Look, I know you want to fight.

80
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,192
And I know you're not scared
of rapers or murderers or…

81
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:32,947
This is different. This is…
This is death.

82
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,451
You want to know what they're like?
Death. That's what they're like.

83
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,294
I know Death.

84
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:50,506
He's got many faces.

85
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,595
I look forward to seeing this one.

86
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,229
-My weapon?
-I'll get right on it.

87
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,808
I'm sorry for what I did to you.

88
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,271
You weren't sorry then.

89
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,858
You were protecting your family.

90
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,695
I'm not that person anymore.

91
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,449
You still would be, if you hadn't
pushed me out of that window.

92
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,536
And I would still be Brandon Stark.

93
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,373
-You're not?
-No.

94
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:07,542
I'm something else now.

95
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:10,753
You're not angry at me.

96
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:13,631
I'm not angry at anyone.

97
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,967
Why didn't you tell them?

98
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,845
You won't be able to help us
in this fight

99
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,138
if I let them murder you first.

100
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,352
What about afterwards?

101
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,313
How do you know there is an afterwards?

102
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:41,909
Next up.

103
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,001
Put a marker in the ground!

104
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:55,590
-Bring it up to the wall!
-Up onto the wall. All right.

105
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:57,800
-All right.
-All right.

106
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:01,554
Well, here we are.

107
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,475
-Yes, here we are.
-Together again.

108
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,855
And the masses rejoice.

109
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:16,360
-How do they feel about their new queen?
-She's your new queen too.

110
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,156
They remember what happened

111
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,742
the last time Targaryens
brought dragons north.

112
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:26,287
They'll come around
once they see Daenerys is different.

113
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,206
And she is? Different?

114
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,041
She is.

115
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:31,876
-You're sure about her?
-I am.

116
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:36,297
-She didn't seem sure about you.
-It's hard to blame her.

117
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:41,135
I made a mistake common to clever people.
I underestimated my opponents.

118
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,639
Cersei told me the pregnancy
had changed her.

119
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,392
A chance for you both to start again.
And I believed her.

120
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,189
Was she lying about the baby too?

121
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,859
No, that part is real.

122
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,241
She's always been good
at using the truth to tell lies.

123
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,620
I wouldn't be too hard on yourself.
She's fooled me more than anybody.

124
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:13,376
-What?
-She never fooled you.

125
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:18,256
You always knew exactly what she was,
and you loved her anyway.

126
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:30,726
So,

127
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:35,189
we're going to die at Winterfell.

128
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,943
Not the death I would've chosen.

129
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:43,573
I always pictured myself
dying in my own bed,

130
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:47,618
at the age of 80,
with a belly full of wine

131
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:49,954
-and a girl's mouth around my cock.
-A girl's mouth around your cock.

132
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,044
At least Cersei won't get to murder me.

133
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:00,923
I'm sure I'll feel some satisfaction
denying her that pleasure

134
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:04,010
while I'm being ripped apart by dead men.

135
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:08,931
Maybe after I'm dead,

136
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:13,477
I'll march down to King's Landing
and rip her apart.

137
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,034
Good.

138
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,213
Good.

139
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:47,553
Good. Yes, aim.

140
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,725
Don't rush. Come forward.

141
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,854
-Come on.
-Ser Jaime.

142
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:57,897
Lady Brienne.

143
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:07,448
He's come a long way.

144
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:11,118
-He's all right.
-One more time. Come on.

145
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:14,413
-Still has a lot to learn.
-I'm sure you'll teach him.

146
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:15,498
Better, better.

147
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:18,125
I've been told you're commanding
the left flank.

148
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:21,962
I am. It's… It's good ground.

149
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:23,464
It is.

150
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:27,259
The rise, it should give us
some advantage.

151
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:30,096
If we can keep a tight formation,
we might be able to beat them back.

152
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,515
Yes, I think you're right.

153
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,017
-What are you doing?
-What?

154
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,812
-I think you know.
-I truly don't.

155
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,897
We have never had a conversation
last this long

156
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,983
-without you insulting me. Not once.
-You want me to insult you?

157
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,151
-No!
-Good.

158
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,702
I came to Winterfell because…

159
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,292
I'm not the fighter I used to be.

160
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,631
But I'd be honored to serve
under your command, if you'll have me.

161
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,600
I better get back.

162
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,498
Forgive me, Khaleesi.

163
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:45,337
-Have you done something to offend me?
-Many things.

164
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,047
Long ago and long forgiven.

165
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:51,552
But you did forgive, despite my failures.

166
00:16:54,889 --> 00:17:00,186
When I heard you'd named Tyrion
your Hand, it broke my heart.

167
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:04,940
When I named him Hand,
I didn't know if I'd ever see you again.

168
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,485
You made the right choice.

169
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,404
I wasn't under the impression
you liked him very much.

170
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:11,697
I didn't.

171
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:15,034
His mouth hardly stopped moving
between Volantis and Meereen.

172
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,994
It was all I could do
not to throw him in the sea.

173
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,084
But the mind behind all those words…

174
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:30,007
He's made mistakes. Serious mistakes.

175
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,219
As have we all.

176
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:38,474
He owns his and learns from them.

177
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:43,270
You're advising me to forgive
the man who stole your position?

178
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:45,606
I am.

179
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:50,236
And one other suggestion,
if you'll allow me.

180
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:55,115
The moment we can get
the last infantryman out onto the field,

181
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,327
-we should shut the gates.
-Keep them open for as long as you can.

182
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:00,996
There are still people coming in
from the countryside.

183
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,839
Lady Sansa, I was hoping
we could speak alone.

184
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,609
I thought you and I were
on the verge of agreement before.

185
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,194
About Ser Jaime.

186
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:39,285
Brienne has been loyal to me, always.
I trust her more than anyone.

187
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,621
I wish I could have
that kind of faith in my advisors.

188
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:45,666
Tyrion is a good man.

189
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,836
He was never anything
but decent towards me.

190
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:52,548
I didn't ask him to be my Hand
simply because he was good.

191
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:58,345
I asked him to be my Hand
because he was good, and intelligent

192
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:00,598
and ruthless when he had to be.

193
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,851
He never should have trusted Cersei.

194
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,395
You never should have either.

195
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,318
I thought he knew his sister.

196
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,821
Families are complicated.

197
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:18,866
Ours certainly have been.

198
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:22,828
A sad thing to have in common.

199
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,374
We have other things in common.

200
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,294
We've both known what it means
to lead people

201
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,838
who aren't inclined
to accept a woman's rule.

202
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:36,467
And we've both done a damn good job
of it, from what I can tell.

203
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:43,766
And yet, I can't help but feel
we're at odds with one another.

204
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:46,685
Why is that?

205
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:52,441
Your brother.

206
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:57,154
He loves you, you know that.

207
00:19:59,073 --> 00:19:59,990
That bothers you.

208
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:05,579
Men do stupid things for women.
They're easily manipulated.

209
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:13,170
All my life, I've known one goal.
The Iron Throne.

210
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,841
Taking it back from the people
who destroyed my family,

211
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:21,512
and almost destroyed yours.
My war was against them.

212
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:25,057
Until I met Jon.

213
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:32,564
Now I'm here, half a world away,
fighting Jon's war alongside him.

214
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,693
Tell me, who manipulated whom?

215
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:47,538
I should have thanked you
the moment you arrived.

216
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:49,957
That was a mistake.

217
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,212
I'm here because I love your brother,

218
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,007
and I trust him,

219
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,135
and I know he's true to his word.

220
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:05,180
He's only the second man in my life
I can say that about.

221
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,394
-Who was the first?
-Someone taller.

222
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,443
And what happens afterwards?

223
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:23,032
We defeat the dead,
we destroy Cersei.

224
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,242
What happens then?

225
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,537
I take the Iron Throne.

226
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,000
What about the North?

227
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:38,172
It was taken from us,
and we took it back.

228
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:41,175
And we said we'd never bow
to anyone else again.

229
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:43,260
What about the North?

230
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:54,855
-Apologies, my lady. Your Grace.
-What is it?

231
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:19,755
-My queen.
-Your sister?

232
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,467
She only has a few ships,
and she couldn't sail them here.

233
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:26,428
So she's sailing
to the Iron Islands instead,

234
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:30,182
-to take them back in your name.
-But why aren't you with her?

235
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:39,149
I want to fight for Winterfell,
Lady Sansa…

236
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:42,486
if you'll have me.

237
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:16,186
-My lord, we're not soldiers.
-You are now.

238
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:25,028
Look, I made it through most of my years
without ever getting near a fight,

239
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,322
but then I survived
the Battle of the Bastards.

240
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,241
Right outside these walls.

241
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:32,161
If I can live through that,
you can live through this.

242
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,874
They'll outfit you
with weapons at the forge.

243
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,208
Right that way.

244
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:41,295
Thank you.

245
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:45,716
When the time comes,
you'll be down in the crypts.

246
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:49,011
They're the safest place to be.
Through that archway right over there.

247
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,138
Thank you.

248
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,273
Which way should I go?

249
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:07,487
Which way do you want to go?

250
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:12,326
All the children will be going below
when the time comes.

251
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:15,412
But both me brothers were soldiers.

252
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,166
I want to fight too.

253
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:25,547
That's good to hear.

254
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,592
I'm going to be in the crypt with my son,

255
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:31,428
and I'd feel a lot better
with you down there to protect us.

256
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,430
I'm sure a lot of people would.

257
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:42,064
All right. I'll defend the crypt, then.

258
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,493
Riders coming in!

259
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,395
-My little crow.
-I thought we'd lost you.

260
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:23,563
Almost.

261
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:35,575
How did you find each other?

262
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,996
-We met up at the Last Hearth.
-The dead got there first.

263
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,878
-The Umbers?
-Fighting for the Night King now.

264
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:50,340
We had to travel around them to get here.

265
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:54,428
Whoever's not here now is with them.

266
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:59,641
-How long do we have?
-Before the sun comes up tomorrow.

267
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:07,899
The big woman still here?

268
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:12,821
They're coming.

269
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:14,865
Next.

270
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:18,702
We have dragon glass
and Valyrian steel.

271
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:24,875
But there are too many of them.

272
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,544
Far too many.

273
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:31,340
Our enemy doesn't tire.

274
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:34,801
Doesn't stop.

275
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:37,512
Doesn't feel.

276
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:43,143
We can't beat them in a straight fight.
So what can we do?

277
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:48,065
The Night King made them all.
They follow his command.

278
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:50,692
If he falls…

279
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,404
Getting to him may be our best chance.

280
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:56,656
If that's true,
he'll never expose himself.

281
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:58,825
Yes, he will.

282
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:01,703
He'll come for me.

283
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:07,125
He's tried before, many times,
with many Three-Eyed Ravens.

284
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:09,211
Why?

285
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:13,131
-What does he want?
-An endless night.

286
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:18,053
He wants to erase this world,
and I am its memory.

287
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:20,639
That's what death is, isn't it?

288
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,017
Forgetting.

289
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:27,938
Being forgotten.

290
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,566
If we forget where we've been
and what we've done,

291
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:35,570
we're not men anymore. Just animals.

292
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:41,243
Your memories don't come from books.
Your stories aren't just stories.

293
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:45,080
If I wanted to erase the world of men,
I'd start with you.

294
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:49,167
-How will he find you?
-His mark is on me.

295
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,337
He always knows where I am.

296
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:55,465
We'll put you in the crypt,
where it's safest.

297
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:56,466
No.

298
00:27:57,092 --> 00:28:00,053
We need to lure him into the open
before his army destroys us all.

299
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:01,847
I'll wait for him in the Godswood.

300
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:06,143
-You want us to use you as bait?
-We're not leaving you alone out there.

301
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:10,063
He won't be. I'll stay with him.
With the Ironborn.

302
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:17,237
I took this castle from you.
Let me defend you now.

303
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:29,040
We'll hold off the rest of them
for as long as we can.

304
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:32,502
When the time comes,
Ser Davos and I will be on the walls,

305
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:34,171
to give you the signal
to light the trench.

306
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:37,716
Ser Davos is perfectly capable
of waving a torch on his own.

307
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,217
You'll be in the crypt.

308
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:43,346
Your Grace, I have fought before,
I can do it again.

309
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:46,057
Alongside the men and women
risking their lives.

310
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,977
There are thousands of them
and only one of you.

311
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:51,271
You can't fight as well as they can,

312
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:53,148
but you can think
better than any of them.

313
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:57,903
You're here because of your mind.
If we survive, I'll need it.

314
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:03,617
The dragons should give us
an edge in the field.

315
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,912
If they're in the field,
they're not protecting Bran.

316
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:11,166
We need to be near him. Not too near,
or the Night King won't come.

317
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:13,752
But close enough
to pursue him when he does.

318
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:19,090
-Dragonfire will stop him?
-I don't know. No one's ever tried.

319
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,390
We're all going to die.

320
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:31,561
But at least we die together.

321
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,108
Let's get some rest.

322
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,410
Your Grace.

323
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:05,136
-Do you need help?
-No.

324
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:10,642
-You've had a strange journey.
-Stranger than most.

325
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,145
I'd like to hear about it.

326
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:21,444
-It's a long story.
-If only we were trapped in a castle

327
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,156
in the middle of winter,
with nowhere to go.

328
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,306
Hello.

329
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:13,872
When Daenerys takes her throne,
there will be no place for us here.

330
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,791
I am loyal to my queen.

331
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:20,295
I will fight for her
until her enemies are defeated,

332
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:24,424
but when the war is over
and she has won…

333
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:29,929
do you want to grow old in this place?

334
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:37,312
Is there nothing else you want to do,
nothing else you want to see?

335
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:43,902
Naath. I'd like to see the beaches again.

336
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:50,950
-Then I will take you there.
-My people are peaceful.

337
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:56,456
-We cannot protect ourselves.
-My people are not peaceful.

338
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,125
We will protect you.

339
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:17,102
Have you told her yet?

340
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:21,898
No.

341
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:26,820
Being careful.

342
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,282
Biding your time.

343
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:35,453
Waiting for the perfect--

344
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:49,384
And now our watch begins.

345
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:55,849
Gilly? Little Sam?

346
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,145
They'll be safe, down in the crypt.

347
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,606
If you want to join them…

348
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:09,571
to protect them.

349
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:13,199
Everyone seems to forget that I was
the first man to kill a white walker.

350
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,368
-I've killed Thenns.
-Thenn.

351
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:16,995
I've saved Gilly more than once.

352
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:19,956
I stole a considerable number
of books from the Citadel library,

353
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:24,127
survived the Fist of the First Men.
You need me out there.

354
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:27,464
Well, if that's what it's come to,
we really are fucked.

355
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:30,341
Well, calling you "fucked"
wouldn't be strictly accurate.

356
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:35,847
Samwell Tarly.

357
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:40,226
Slayer of White Walkers. Lover of Ladies.

358
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:44,564
As if we needed any more signs
the world was ending.

359
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:48,568
Think back to where we started.

360
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:54,449
Us, Grenn, Pyp.

361
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:01,206
-Now it's just us three.
-Last man left, burn the rest of us.

362
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:19,390
I wish father were here.

363
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:24,020
I would love to see the look on his face

364
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:27,857
when he realizes his two sons
are about to die defending Winterfell.

365
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,239
That would be something to see.

366
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:42,747
I remember the first time we were here,

367
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:45,500
the first time I saw this hall.

368
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,378
You were a golden lion.

369
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,256
I was a drunken whoremonger.

370
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,716
It was all so simple.

371
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,177
It wasn't so simple.

372
00:34:57,303 --> 00:35:01,015
I was sleeping with my sister
and you had one friend in the world

373
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:05,144
-who was sleeping with his sister.
-I was speaking in relative terms.

374
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:09,774
-Do you miss it?
-Of course, I miss it.

375
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:13,611
Well, my golden lion days are done,

376
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:16,072
but whoremongering
is still an option for you.

377
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:18,283
It's not.

378
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,078
Things would be easier if it were.

379
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:27,167
The perils of self-betterment.

380
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:38,636
-My lady.
-Oh, we didn't mean to interrupt.

381
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,722
We were just looking
for somewhere warm to--

382
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:43,808
To contemplate your imminent death.
You've come to the right place.

383
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,811
You want some of this piss? It's not bad.

384
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:49,439
-It's not good either.
-Thank you, my lord.

385
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:53,026
I don't think that's wise.
The battle might start at any moment.

386
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:57,697
Half a cup.

387
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:02,118
-And you?
-No, thank you.

388
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:03,536
I should try and get some sleep.

389
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,080
You really think any of us
are going to sleep tonight?

390
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:08,833
Join us.

391
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:12,795
All right. Just a bit.

392
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:23,139
-Well, what do we have here?
-Ser Davos, join us.

393
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:25,266
No, none for me, thanks.
Came here for this.

394
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:30,271
I figured I could wait to die
freezing my balls off out there

395
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,608
or wait to die nice and warm in here.

396
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:40,114
It could be our last night
in this world, you know.

397
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,243
Yes, well, I'm glad you're here.

398
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:48,456
Here fighting with us.
Glad you survived Eastwatch.

399
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:49,457
Would you like a drink?

400
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,168
Brought my own.

401
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,260
They call you "King Killer."

402
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,013
I'm sure someone does.

403
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:09,644
They call me "Giantsbane."
Want to know why?

404
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:23,032
I killed a giant when I was 10.

405
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:28,413
Then I climbed right
into bed with his wife.

406
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:33,501
When she woke up,
you know what she did?

407
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,508
Suckled me at her teat for three months.

408
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:46,431
Thought I was her baby.
That's how I got so strong.

409
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:49,267
Giant's milk.

410
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:09,620
Maybe I will have that drink.

411
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:52,288
You never used to shut up.
Now you're just sitting there like a mute.

412
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:56,918
Guess I've changed.

413
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:08,930
-What are you doing up here?
-What's it look like?

414
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:12,058
No, I mean, what are you doing up here?

415
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:16,229
You joined the Brotherhood.

416
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,649
You went beyond the Wall with Jon.
You're here now. Why?

417
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:24,529
When was the last time
you fought for anyone but yourself?

418
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,575
I fought for you, didn't I?

419
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:44,132
Oh, for fuck's sake.
May as well be at a bloody wedding.

420
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:52,807
My lady. It's good to see you again.
I'm sorry we parted the way we did.

421
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:55,560
Was he on your list?

422
00:39:57,228 --> 00:40:00,314
-For a little while.
-That's all right.

423
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,111
The Lord of Light
has brought us together all the same.

424
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:08,823
This is his moment.

425
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,868
-When light--
-Thoros isn't here anymore,

426
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:13,578
so I hope you're not
about to give a sermon.

427
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:15,788
Because if you are,

428
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:19,333
the Lord of Light's gonna wonder
why he brought you back 19 times

429
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:22,044
just to watch you die when
I chuck you over this fucking wall.

430
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:37,768
Where are you going?

431
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:42,648
I'm not spending my final hours
with you two miserable old shits.

432
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:08,466
That for me?

433
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:24,023
This'll work.

434
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:30,863
Last time you saw me,
you wanted me to come to Winterfell.

435
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:33,491
Took the long road, but…

436
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,161
What did the Red Woman want with you?

437
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:44,835
She wanted my blood
for some kind of spell.

438
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:46,671
Why your blood?

439
00:41:48,965 --> 00:41:50,466
I'm Robert Baratheon's bastard.

440
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:53,719
I didn't know until she told me.

441
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:57,723
And then she tied me up, stripped me down,
put leeches all over me.

442
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:02,270
Was that your first time?

443
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:05,982
No, yeah, I've never had leeches
put all over me--

444
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:08,526
-Your first time with a woman.
-What?

445
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:12,613
I… I didn't… I wasn't with her.

446
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:15,449
Were you with other girls
before that in King's Landing?

447
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:17,285
Or after?

448
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:23,332
You don't remember?

449
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:29,213
-Yes, I was.
-One? Two?

450
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:31,966
-Twenty?
-I didn't keep count.

451
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,219
Yes, you did.

452
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:39,598
Three.

453
00:42:46,022 --> 00:42:47,732
We're probably going to die soon.

454
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:53,612
I ought to know what it's like
before that happens.

455
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,287
Arya, I--

456
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:41,160
I'm not the Red Woman.
Take your own bloody pants off.

457
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:08,354
It's strange, isn't it?

458
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:15,569
Almost everyone here's
fought the Starks at one time or another.

459
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:21,659
And here we are in their castle,
ready to defend it. Together.

460
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:26,997
At least we'll die with honor.

461
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,547
I think we might live.

462
00:44:38,134 --> 00:44:39,677
I… I do.

463
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:43,681
How many battles
have we survived between us?

464
00:44:45,558 --> 00:44:46,684
Ser Davos Seaworth.

465
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:51,564
Survivor of both the Blackwater
and the Battle of the Bastards.

466
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:54,442
All without a shred of combat ability.

467
00:44:55,443 --> 00:44:59,363
Ser Jaime Lannister,
fabled hero of the Siege of Pyke.

468
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:01,824
Fabled loser
of the Battle of Whispering Wood.

469
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:02,825
Hear, hear!

470
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:07,746
Ser Brienne of Tarth.
Defeated the Hound in--

471
00:45:09,165 --> 00:45:14,670
-Pardon me, Lady Brienne.
-She's not a ser? You're not a knight?

472
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:17,548
Women can't be knights.

473
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:19,133
-Why not?
-Tradition.

474
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:23,637
-Fuck tradition.
-I don't even want to be a knight.

475
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:34,440
I'm no king. But if I were,
I'd knight you ten times over.

476
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:41,989
You don't need a king.
Any knight can make another knight.

477
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:48,204
I'll prove it.

478
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:53,792
Kneel, Lady Brienne.

479
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,715
Do you want to be a knight or not?

480
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:05,846
Kneel.

481
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:03,696
In the name of the Warrior,
I charge you to be brave.

482
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:11,203
In the name of the Father,
I charge you to be just.

483
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:19,420
In the name of the Mother,
I charge you to defend the innocent.

484
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:30,472
Arise, Brienne of Tarth…

485
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:34,602
a knight of the Seven Kingdoms.

486
00:47:52,161 --> 00:47:56,999
Ser Brienne of Tarth!
Knight of the Seven Kingdoms!

487
00:48:07,176 --> 00:48:08,886
We have all we need to win this war.

488
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:13,724
I have trained my men, women and children.
I have fought before. I can fight again.

489
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:17,061
Please, listen to me.
You're the future of our house.

490
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:18,646
I don't need you to remind me of that.

491
00:48:19,355 --> 00:48:21,774
You'll be safer in the crypt.
These things we're fighting--

492
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:23,442
I will not hide underground.

493
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:26,779
I pledged to fight for the North,
and I will fight.

494
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:38,290
-I'm sorry, I didn't mean to--
-It's all right. We're done here.

495
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:46,507
I wish you good fortune, cousin.

496
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:49,677
Thank you, my lady.

497
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:52,930
-My lady.
-My lady.

498
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:58,352
What have you got there?

499
00:49:00,396 --> 00:49:01,355
It's called Heartsbane.

500
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:06,360
-It's my family sword but--
-You still have a family.

501
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:10,531
Yes. And I'd love to defend them with it.

502
00:49:12,825 --> 00:49:14,493
But I can't really hold it upright.

503
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:20,416
Your father,
he taught me how to be a man.

504
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,168
How to do what's right.

505
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:26,880
This is right.

506
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:33,220
It's Valyrian steel.

507
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:36,557
I'd be honored if you'd take it.

508
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:51,780
I'll wield it in his memory…

509
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:57,745
to guard the realms of men.

510
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:02,916
I'll see you when it's through.

511
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:16,388
I hope we win.

512
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:28,776
-We'd better get some rest.
-No, let's stay a bit longer.

513
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:29,902
We're out of wine.

514
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:37,534
How about a song?

515
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:40,788
One of you must know one.

516
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:45,375
-Ser Davos?
-You'll pray for a quick death.

517
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:50,047
Ser Brienne?

518
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:05,687
High in the halls
Of the kings who are gone

519
00:51:06,355 --> 00:51:10,567
Jenny would dance with her ghosts

520
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:16,532
The ones she had lost
And the ones she had found

521
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:21,078
And the ones
Who had loved her the most

522
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:27,459
The ones who'd been gone
For so very long

523
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:32,172
She couldn't remember their names

524
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:38,303
They spun her around
On the damp old stones

525
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:43,183
Spun away all her sorrow and pain

526
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:49,189
And she never wanted to leave

527
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:54,987
Never wanted to leave

528
00:51:55,612 --> 00:52:00,158
Never wanted to leave

529
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:05,038
Never wanted to leave

530
00:52:06,415 --> 00:52:10,752
Never wanted to leave

531
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:17,509
Never wanted to leave

532
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:01,803
Who's that?

533
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,142
Lyanna Stark.

534
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:16,902
My brother Rhaegar.

535
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:23,116
Everyone told me
he was decent and kind.

536
00:53:24,368 --> 00:53:28,330
He liked to sing.
Gave money to poor children.

537
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:32,834
And he raped her.

538
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:35,837
He didn't.

539
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:41,218
He loved her.

540
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:49,434
They were married in secret.

541
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:54,481
After Rhaegar fell on the Trident,
she had a son.

542
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:59,236
Robert would have murdered the baby
if he ever found out,

543
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:00,320
and Lyanna knew it.

544
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:03,615
So the last thing she did

545
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:09,162
as she bled to death on her birthing bed
was give the boy to her brother,

546
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:11,873
Ned Stark…

547
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:15,752
to raise as his bastard.

548
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:20,465
My name…

549
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:24,469
my real name…

550
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:29,266
is Aegon Targaryen.

551
00:54:32,561 --> 00:54:34,354
-That's impossible.
-I wish it were.

552
00:54:36,148 --> 00:54:38,984
-Who told you this?
-Bran.

553
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:42,154
-He saw it.
-He saw it?

554
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:44,031
And Samwell confirmed it.

555
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:47,659
He read about their marriage
at the Citadel

556
00:54:47,743 --> 00:54:48,910
without even knowing what it meant.

557
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:52,372
A secret no one in the world knew,

558
00:54:53,582 --> 00:54:56,001
except your brother and your best friend.

559
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:59,296
Doesn't seem strange to you?

560
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:03,133
It's true, Dany.

561
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:06,094
I know it is.

562
00:55:11,058 --> 00:55:12,309
If it were true,

563
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:17,022
it would make you the last male heir
of House Targaryen.

564
00:55:22,527 --> 00:55:24,404
You'd have a claim to the Iron Throne.

565
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:35,749
Form up!

566
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:41,004
Get yourselves back!

567
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:46,319
High in the halls
Of the kings who are gone

568
00:56:46,695 --> 00:56:51,491
Jenny would dance with her ghosts

569
00:56:51,992 --> 00:56:54,828
The ones she had lost

570
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:58,415
And the ones she had found

571
00:56:59,332 --> 00:57:05,130
And the ones
Who had loved her the most

572
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:12,846
The ones who'd been gone
For so very long

573
00:57:13,305 --> 00:57:18,059
She couldn't remember their names

574
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:24,482
They spun her around
On the damp old stones

575
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:29,821
Spun away all her sorrow and pain

576
00:57:29,905 --> 00:57:35,327
And she never wanted to leave

577
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:40,874
Never wanted to leave

578
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:47,547
Never wanted to leave

579
00:57:47,631 --> 00:57:52,260
Never wanted to leave
