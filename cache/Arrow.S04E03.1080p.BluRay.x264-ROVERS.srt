1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,003
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,886
<i>After five years in hell,
I returned home with only one goal,</i>

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,605
<i>to save my city.</i>

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,524
<i>But my old approach wasn't enough.</i>

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,563
<i>I had to become someone else.</i>

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,525
<i>I had to become something else.</i>

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,405
<i>I had to become the Green Arrow.</i>

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,410
Previously on Arrow...

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,886
<i>The media's been
calling them the Ghosts.</i>

10
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,610
They're <i>like</i> nothing
we'd ever seen before.

11
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,080
<i>Anytime we get too close
to one of them,</i>

12
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,725
they off themselves with cyanide.

13
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,610
Darhk's Ghosts, they're H.l.V.E.

14
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,768
<i>An organization called
H.l.V.E. killed my brother.</i>

15
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,564
Taking Lyla, that was your idea, Oliver.

16
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,961
<i>In front of our daughter.</i>

17
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,124
You didn't just lose my friendship.
You lost my respect.

18
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,450
<i>Thea, whatever
is going on with you,</i>

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,926
the League, they'll know what to do.

20
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,406
We're going to Nanda Parbat.

21
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,802
Why are we not telling my brother?

22
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,805
<i>Because you're not the only reason
for us going to Nanda Parbat.</i>

23
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,042
Need a hand, John?

24
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,602
<i>I'm good.
Varsity track, all-state, 100 meters.</i>

25
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,162
Dig?

26
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,761
Felicity, you know where
that son of a bitch went?

27
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,329
He vanished.
We call them Ghosts for a reason.

28
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,010
But I got air support
coming in on Number Two.

29
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,600
<i>"ARROW". I got him.</i>

30
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,806
Oliver?

31
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,721
<i>- Oliver?
- He's all right, Felicity.</i>

32
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,370
We need eyes back on our target.

33
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,722
I'll give you one better than that.

34
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,167
Twenty feet ahead,
I got one gift wrapped for you.

35
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,210
Feels like old times, the three of us.

36
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,880
The OGs, the original gangstas.

37
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,767
You're not checking out
without answering a few questions first.

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,765
Where can I find H.I.V.E.?
Who's behind the Ghosts?

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,764
Answer me!

40
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,000
Dig?

41
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,411
Now, he's gone.

42
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,080
Damn it!

43
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,888
We needed
more boots on the ground, Oliver.

44
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,202
Thea and Laurel
picked a fine day for a spa treatment.

45
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,761
I don't think Thea would be much help
in the state of mind she's in.

46
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,451
Where the hell did they go anyway?

47
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,282
I really enjoy sparring with you, Nyssa.

48
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,201
- I'm not sparring.
- I know.

49
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,124
That's what makes it so much fun.

50
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,804
You know I would show you no mercy
if given the opportunity.

51
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,802
That's why I take great care
not to give you the opportunity.

52
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,010
Next time, I'll take your head off.

53
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,482
My liege, two foreigners are here.

54
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,081
One of them claims to be
the daughter of Ra's al Ghul.

55
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,766
No. lam his daughter.

56
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,764
What a pleasant surprise.

57
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,446
Sister-in-law.

58
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,491
What brings you to Nanda Parbat?

59
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,682
They have a coffin with them, my liege.

60
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,600
A coffin?

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,162
I want you
to bring my sister back to life.

62
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,806
No.

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,482
You took her life away from her.
It is your obligation to bring her back.

64
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,848
I have no obligations in this house.

65
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,522
You don't get to waltz in here and
demand a cup of tea, let alone this.

66
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,371
Thea wasn't dead.

67
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,890
- Sara is.
- Thanks to you.

68
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,682
What you are asking for
hasn't been done in ages past.

69
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,484
Even then, only in legend.

70
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,691
Which is why I did not ask my father to
use the Pit to save Sara after she fell.

71
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,043
Even if Sara went into the Pit,
even if it worked,

72
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,281
who, what came out of the Pit
would not be Sara.

73
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,407
Laurel, I am sorry, truly sorry.

74
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,042
But, of course, my answer is no.

75
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,968
Okay, I know that was kind of a bust,

76
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,090
but wasn't it fun having the original
"Team Arrow" back together?

77
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,846
- You shouldn't have.
- Got that off one of the Ghosts.

78
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,411
It's where they hide
their cyanide capsules.

79
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,768
Looks like an upper left bicuspid.

80
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,366
There was a very brief time

81
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,769
where I envisioned a future for myself
as a dental hygienist.

82
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,242
The best lead we've gotten
in the last three months.

83
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,006
It'll take the DNA sequencer
a little bit of time,

84
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,449
so I was thinking margaritas
while we wait.

85
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,841
You remember that place we went
after we took down the Dodger?

86
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,208
Oh. What do you say?

87
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,883
It's been a while
since it was just the three of us.

88
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,770
I got a family to get back to.

89
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,927
I guess he just needs more time.

90
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,601
Time hasn't been doing anything.
Apologies haven't.

91
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,966
What're you saying?

92
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:02,683
I'm saying that
I'm done waiting for him to come around.

93
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,130
Work faster!

94
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,244
Like a fish to water.

95
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,926
What did you say?

96
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,811
People QOSSiP-

97
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,931
They say that you're a rich kid
who got shipwrecked here.

98
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,482
Bossing people around, giving orders.

99
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,928
It must feel just like home to you.

100
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,811
We got a runner!

101
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,889
<i>Hey, watch your field.</i>

102
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,011
Hey! Come on, man.
Let's do this the easy way.

103
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,404
Yeah! That's the way.

104
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,969
Well, what are you gonna do?
Talk him into surrendering?

105
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,685
That's how you do it.

106
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,760
Who are you?

107
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,526
Definitely not someone
who deserves to be shot.

108
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,681
Your wife and kid are out, by the way.

109
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,530
Who are you?

110
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,205
Relax.

111
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,280
I'm a friendly.

112
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,882
You're A.R.G.U.S.?

113
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,202
He can read. Lyla sent me.

114
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,364
My wife left the agency seven months ago.
She couldn't have sent you anywhere.

115
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,126
She asked back
when she was still with the agency.

116
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,562
Took me a while because, well, favors

117
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,882
aren't exactly
at the top of my to-do list.

118
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,725
Here, ID on whoever hired Floyd Lawton
to do a hit back in '09.

119
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,490
"Mina Fayad"?

120
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,881
Where can I find her?

121
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,163
Well, that's the best part.
TSA flagged her coming in last night.

122
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,889
Flew in from Markovia.

123
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,087
<i>I'll contact you with her location.</i>

124
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,606
Ah. Ms. Fayad. You brought a guest.

125
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,411
As instructed.

126
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,201
Not by me.

127
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,205
The vigilante problem in this city
is greater than anticipated.

128
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,568
Your partners in H.l.V.E.
asked me to take steps.

129
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,443
You don't exactly look like
a problem solver. What do you do?

130
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,561
I play cards, mostly.

131
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,726
Perhaps a demonstration.

132
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,924
Funny you should mention.
I happen to have just the problem.

133
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,602
My operatives are under orders
to choose death before capture.

134
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,407
This gentleman chose wrongly.

135
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,962
They got to me before I could take
the countermeasure.

136
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,806
He's also prone to excuses,
which I find tiresome.

137
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,971
That was good.

138
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,560
Ooh.

139
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,960
<i>"JEREMY". That one was free.</i>

140
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,166
Taking out the Green Arrow
and his friends,

141
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,131
that'll cost.

142
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,720
Deal.

143
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,171
I'm not giving up.

144
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,966
I'm never giving up.

145
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,011
Because you're thinking only of yourself.

146
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,850
I expected your support.

147
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,521
I was counting on it.

148
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,524
Then you never really knew me at all.

149
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,687
The Pit gave my father a long life.

150
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,364
Longer than what was natural
and much longer than he deserved.

151
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,683
But he paid a dark price for it.

152
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,207
A price Thea is no doubt paying now.

153
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,044
I wouldn't wish it on my most
bitter enemy, let alone my beloved.

154
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,130
I don't know if the Pit
can bring her back.

155
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,051
And Malcolm's right.

156
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,205
I don't know
what Sara will be like if it does.

157
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,487
But what I do know is that I have to try.

158
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,960
To what end?

159
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,051
To have your sister
returned to you a monster?

160
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,482
Her spirit, the part that we both love,

161
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,247
that's the part that I have to believe
will come back.

162
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,407
You're not doing this out of love,
you're doing this out of grief.

163
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,484
I miss Sara, too.

164
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,923
But she is gone, Laurel.

165
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,720
Forever.

166
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,730
I have accepted it.

167
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,369
I think it's time you did, too.

168
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,763
Still wishing you were a dental hygienist?

169
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,241
More like a molecular biologist.

170
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,571
You see this?

171
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,366
No.

172
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,723
In my defense, I flunked biology.

173
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,604
Well, I got an A-plus,

174
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,286
and I still have no idea
what the hell is going on here.

175
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,081
This DNA has half of the genetic
markers that it should have, half.

176
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,407
How's that possible?

177
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,887
It's not. This guy should be nothing more
than a pile of goo.

178
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,126
What now?

179
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,801
Robbery at a parts store, Litchfield Ave.

180
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,044
- Call Dig. Tell him I'll meet him there.
- Ah!

181
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,969
Hold ups are a little below
your pay grade.

182
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,362
You sure you don't want
the S.C.P.D. to handle this one?

183
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,769
How effective have the police been
in solving the city's problems recently?

184
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,246
That's a good point.

185
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,642
John's still not answering his phone.

186
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,121
I'll be fine.

187
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,288
Still, I don't like you going out there
without backup.

188
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,323
I'm not. I have you.

189
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,164
That restraint you showed back there,

190
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,330
- bury it.
- Here.

191
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,605
Violence is the only thing
these losers understand.

192
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,131
The guys out here who can't handle that,

193
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,249
they either wash out
or end up doing the product,

194
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,524
both of which are fast-tracks
to a bullet in the head.

195
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,847
The product.

196
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,650
Reiter hasn't told me a lot about it.

197
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,844
He calls it Slam,
genetically modified hybrid,

198
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,526
one part heroin poppy, one part coca leaf.

199
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,011
Get you higher than the Empire State.

200
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,440
<i>Conklin.</i>

201
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,129
We got a problem.
Some Slam's missing, a whole cake.

202
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,043
The runner was just a distraction.

203
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,166
Any idea who did it?

204
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,044
All right then, round them up!

205
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,041
What are you gonna do?

206
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,204
I told you, only one thing
these losers respond to.

207
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,324
Get on the ground.

208
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,565
Thanks for coming, by the way.

209
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,245
Ms. Fayad wasn't sure it would work,

210
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,722
but I knew you couldn't turn down
a good old fashioned robbery.

211
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,611
Are you ready to call this yet?

212
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,405
Now you can call it.

213
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,291
Game's not over yet.

214
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,326
Are you all right?

215
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,330
Aside from the fact
that you won't help my friends?

216
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,521
I wouldn't be helping Sara,
as you know more than anyone.

217
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,685
What gave me away?

218
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,688
When I was cautioning Laurel
about the effects of the Pit,

219
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,649
I saw the look on your face.

220
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,045
<i>You're feeling it, aren't you?</i>

221
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,171
<i>The blood lust.</i>

222
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,363
What's happening to me?

223
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,365
The Pit contains traces of the souls

224
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,841
of all the men and women
who have bathed in its waters.

225
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:52,205
And what those waters restore
they can also take. Life for life.

226
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,166
What are you saying?

227
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,329
That you need to feed this impulse.

228
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,846
Give in to it.

229
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,282
Once you do, it will subside for a time.

230
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,166
Okay.

231
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,002
I'll just go on a killing spree.

232
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,721
Thank you for the fatherly advice.

233
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,646
Can you just, for a second,
pretend to be a normal father?

234
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,970
Can you do that, Dad?

235
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,965
Do you have anything remotely normal
to offer me?

236
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,526
All right.

237
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,083
There is something,
high in the mountains, a man.

238
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,526
Some call him a sage.

239
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,405
He has a way
with the ancient arts of healing.

240
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,208
He may be able to help you with this,
though I am not sure.

241
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,322
Does that qualify as being normal?

242
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,170
Normal enough.

243
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,605
Get some rest.

244
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,531
We'll start at first light.

245
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,771
- This hurt?
- Yeah, it stings.

246
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,686
Good. That's what you get for trying
to take on a meta all by yourself.

247
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,120
- A meta?
- Yeah!

248
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,251
Turns out, Central City is missing one.

249
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,762
A Jeremy Tell. Cisco says
we should call him "Double Down."

250
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,291
Which doesn't exactly make sense,

251
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,921
since he was getting a tattoo
when the dark matter wave hit.

252
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,360
You missed quite a show, tonight.

253
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,528
Sorry I couldn't help out.
It's a long story.

254
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,651
Oh, my God. it is not a long story.
It is the shortest story in history.

255
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,371
Two guys go take on criminals
without asking for backup

256
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,443
and nearly get killed in the process.

257
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,642
You know,
I haven't said anything up till now,

258
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,291
because I was hoping that the two of you

259
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,130
would remove your heads
from your own asses

260
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,970
without assistance.
Turns out, I was wrong.

261
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,127
Hey, Felicity...

262
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,243
No, no, no. This is the part where I talk
and you two listen.

263
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,249
The both of you nearly got killed
out there tonight

264
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,488
because you didn't have
each other's backs.

265
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,722
That was a one-time deal, Felicity.
It won't happen again.

266
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,285
I absolutely agree.

267
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,007
Because the two of you
are going to sit down here

268
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,764
until you have resolved your issues.

269
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,240
Do we have an understanding?

270
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,844
_l-ley__
Do we have an understanding?

271
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,166
Yeah.

272
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,164
I'm gonna take this
to a guy at Palmer Tech

273
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,847
to find out how some lunatic meta
turns tattoos into lethal weapons.

274
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,768
If you two haven't figured out
your issues by the time I get back,

275
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,521
I'm gonna find a bunch of Mirakuru
soldiers to knock some sense into you.

276
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,361
It's been months, man.

277
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,525
And I don't know how many apologies...

278
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,523
I mean, John, you're a forgiving person.

279
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,206
Oliver, this isn't about forgiveness, man.

280
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,200
I don't know how
to move forward with this, us.

281
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,362
Doing what we do.

282
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,211
- We've worked fine since I got back.
- We've got lucky.

283
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,042
Oliver, there was a time
I would've taken a bullet for you.

284
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,050
And I don't know if I would do that now.

285
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,210
Which means that even when we're
out there, we are not out there together.

286
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,324
You crossed a line, man.

287
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,690
And the fact that you could do that again
sits in the back of my head somewhere.

288
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,245
<i>L</i> get it! <i>I</i> get it.

289
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,164
I understand that I crossed a line.

290
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,886
I understand that I lost your trust.

291
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:12,246
What I do not understand is why you
won't give me a chance to earn it back.

292
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,568
You think this meta tonight
is connected to Darhk?

293
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,603
I don't know. Uh...

294
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,526
He mentioned a new player, a woman.

295
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,246
Fayad.

296
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,571
We need to go.

297
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,440
Where?

298
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,446
Some place where I'm gonna try
to trust you again.

299
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,411
I like to think of all of us as a team.

300
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,128
Teammates need to trust each other.

301
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,125
Right now,
I'm having a little difficulty doing that.

302
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,601
I want y'all to tell me
who stole the product,

303
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,882
or else this man right here
is gonna eat a bullet.

304
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,726
Nobody?

305
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,644
Let's try this again.

306
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,806
Hey, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

307
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,960
You said that violence is the only thing
these people respond to.

308
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,327
Doesn't seem to be working.

309
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,960
Well, what do you have in mind,
harsh language?

310
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,641
I've been on this island three years.
I've learned some things.

311
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,165
About what?

312
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,926
Pain.

313
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,088
- Uh-oh.
- "Uh-oh"?

314
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,568
Those aren't the words you wanna say
when your CEO walks into a room.

315
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,690
Well, technically, "uh" and "oh"
aren't words, they're interjections...

316
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,684
Please tell me these are the prototypes
for our new world-changing technology.

317
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,649
Since I'm inventing them,
wouldn't that make them my...

318
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,080
What is this?

319
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,607
<i>Contact lenses
with built-in HD displays.</i>

320
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,165
<i>Ooh, That's impressive and fast.</i>

321
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,850
- How much would they sell for?
- 100,000.

322
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,768
- $100,000?
- Per lens.

323
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,486
Hmm.

324
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,967
<i>Everything okay?</i>

325
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,851
Yeah, my phone just keeps acting up.
Need to restart it.

326
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,202
Ooh!

327
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,161
Ah!

328
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,330
This is an autonomous
communications device.

329
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,206
Which is great, except for the fact
that it spontaneously explodes.

330
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,361
Okay, maybe you need something
to get your mind off all this.

331
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,966
Like a little side project,
clear your head.

332
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,040
Like gambling?

333
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,561
I need a full workup.

334
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,201
It's possible it's made out of
some sort of bio-organic material.

335
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,881
I need to know everything
that you can find out about it.

336
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,164
Strange. These edges.

337
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,409
It doesn't look mass manufactured.
Where'd you find it?

338
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,042
Casino.

339
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,641
- You gamble?
- Oh, yeah! All the time. Poker's my jam.

340
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,684
It ruined an outside flush for me.
I think my opponent was cheating.

341
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,725
So, you want me to check it
for evidence of marking or something?

342
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,245
Yeah, anything strange,
out of the ordinary.

343
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,005
Like you playing poker?

344
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,365
I will check back in on you later.

345
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,205
- Oh, and, uh, Ms. Smoak?
- Mmm?

346
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,007
There's no such thing
as an "outside flush" in poker.

347
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,562
That's probably why I lost.

348
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,001
You remember Russia?

349
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,521
Two years ago,
when we got Lyla out of that prison?

350
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,000
Of course.

351
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,283
That night, Lawton told me that my brother

352
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,283
was not collateral damage
in a hit gone bad.

353
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,760
That he was the target.

354
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,924
And that Lawton was hired
by an organization called H.l.V.E.

355
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,441
The other week you reacted

356
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,843
when I said that Ra's called Darhk's men
a "hive" of operatives.

357
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,406
Mmm-hmm.

358
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,605
Could be a coincidence.

359
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,126
I don't think so.

360
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,200
Last page.

361
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,283
That woman hired Lawton
to kill my brother.

362
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,131
And I'm betting she hired that meta
that tried to take you out.

363
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,806
- Based on what?
- Her name is Mina Fayad.

364
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,042
Two years and you didn't tell me.

365
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,810
We have more in common than you think.

366
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,762
Oliver, that's my first legitimate lead.

367
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,286
I have to find her.

368
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,084
Ms. Fayad hired you for one job, one.

369
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,166
Against my objections
and only because my associates

370
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,402
are anxious to progress to Phase Three.

371
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,090
We shouldn't talk about Genesis...

372
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,487
Don't lecture me about secrecy.

373
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,289
Particularly on the same night
that you were just compromised.

374
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,521
<i>' 'L</i>

375
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,843
In the same night that I lost good men
in the name of protecting you.

376
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,527
- Damien.
- Mr. Darhk!

377
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,327
I think I require another demonstration.

378
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,684
You want me to kill her now?

379
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,966
Show me.

380
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,366
Try to kill me.

381
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,042
I kill you, I still get paid?

382
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,851
Do it.

383
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,040
What are you?

384
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,321
Ms. Fayad,

385
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,962
many members of H.l.V.E.,
they consider me to be a charlatan.

386
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,449
That this, this is a parlor trick,

387
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,200
sleight of hand.

388
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,048
This demonstration was for you, Mr. Tell.

389
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,123
Just in case you have any doubt
as to how I process disappointment.

390
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,480
How do you feel?

391
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,840
How do...

392
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,845
How do I feel?

393
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,006
Oh, my God.

394
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,129
There is no sage.

395
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,491
There is no cure.

396
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,120
There never was.

397
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,641
I'm sorry.

398
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:42,242
You will be compelled to kill until
you've slain the one who hurt you.

399
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:46,121
But I can't. Okay, Ra's is already dead.

400
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:50,126
Then the only way to cope
is to indulge the blood lust on others.

401
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,000
So you...

402
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,287
You set your men up to be slaughtered?

403
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,529
You will not feel the hunger
to kill again for weeks.

404
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,171
No need to thank me.

405
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:06,283
There is nothing I wouldn't do
to help my daughter.

406
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,242
I hope we learned a lesson of the benefits
of trusting our friends with our problems.

407
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,846
You mean, like your boyfriend?

408
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,042
You're supposed to be
more evolved than him.

409
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,045
- Hmm?
- Sorry, but he is.

410
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,170
- Can we find her?
- No.

411
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:31,211
She's not coming up on any
of our traffic or security cams.

412
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,807
But I think I have the next best thing,
her cell phone. Or at least

413
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,651
the one that followed her through airport
security on the way to Star City.

414
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,370
Where's her phone now?

415
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,720
Redmond and 8th.

416
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,284
So, which fancy private school
you pick this up in?

417
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,760
Learned it here.

418
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,963
Three years on this island, and I have
been hurt every way you can imagine.

419
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,840
I know what kills,

420
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,326
I know what cripples,

421
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,851
and what just hurts.

422
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,244
Stop! Stop.

423
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,844
He didn't take the drugs.

424
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,280
I did.

425
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,766
You're working us too hard,
and some of the other prisoners are hurt.

426
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,283
I wanted to give them
something for the pain.

427
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,649
And where's the Slam now?

428
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,166
It's all used up.

429
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,449
And I'm not going to tell you by who,

430
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,922
so if you're going to kill me,
just get on with it.

431
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,046
Suit yourself.

432
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,410
Wait, wait, wait.

433
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,840
You've already executed
one prisoner today.

434
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,924
How's Reiter gonna feel about
you exterminating his work force?

435
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,881
Oh, I think he'll make an exception
for a thief.

436
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,764
Or I just make her disappear.

437
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,360
Take her someplace.

438
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,843
They'll never find the body.

439
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,449
All right, take her.

440
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,406
Keep them company.

441
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,805
- Wake up. Wake up, we need to go.
- What?

442
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,971
It was a mistake to come here.

443
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,322
- Thea.
- Stay the hell away from me.

444
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,766
Thea, what's wrong?

445
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,725
He's not gonna help Sara,
and he's not gonna help me.

446
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,321
- Thea!
- Don't talk to me.

447
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,602
- I was only trying to help you...
- Help me?

448
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,281
Yeah, that's funny
on more than a few levels.

449
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:34,401
My favorite is you are the reason
why I am like this in the first place.

450
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,806
I know.

451
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,685
I will not kill people.

452
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,851
I won't.

453
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,525
Just stay out of my life
and the hell away from me.

454
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,968
<i>"MALCOLM". We are bound together, forever.</i>

455
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,771
You and me, father and daughter.

456
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,691
Let me prove it to you.

457
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,087
How?

458
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,362
I am responsible for Sara's death.

459
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,885
Yet, I have the means to make it right,
or at least try to.

460
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:05,722
Do you think, after knowing
what that Pit has done to me,

461
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,127
that I would let that happen to Sara?

462
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,926
I think if you are truly sincere
in fighting your blood lust,

463
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,361
you would offer the same to Sara.

464
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,160
What are you saying?

465
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,401
That I am willing to heal
my daughter's conscience

466
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,285
by restoring your sister's life.

467
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,883
That we should prepare Sara's body
for the ceremony.

468
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,009
I'm still getting a ping
off Ms. Fayad's cell phone.

469
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,480
Ten <i>feet</i> ahead.

470
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,480
John.

471
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,009
<i>It was my first chance for answers.</i>

472
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,366
My last chance.

473
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,401
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be, Oliver.

474
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,760
This isn't your fault. It's mine.

475
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:14,249
I should've trusted you.
Told you about this forever ago.

476
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,331
If I had, she wouldn't have gotten
away from me earlier.

477
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,211
Would be alive enough now
for some answers.

478
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,081
We're gonna get answers.

479
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,124
Oliver, I haven't been able to get answers
for more than two years now.

480
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,968
For more than two years,
you've been doing this alone.

481
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,403
You want me to take a look
at your phone for you, Ms. Smoak?

482
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,563
I think we've reached the point
in our working relationship

483
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,450
where you can call me Felicity.

484
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,486
Have you ever considered
how ironic your name is?

485
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:56,285
"Felicity" refers to the ability to find
appropriate expression for one's thoughts,

486
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,881
which is not exactly something
you're particularly good at.

487
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,770
Yeah. You're right.
Let's stick with Ms. Smoak.

488
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,411
Any luck on our playing card?

489
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,364
Yeah, it's actually right there, Felic...
Uh, Ms. Smoak.

490
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,768
- Mmm-hmm.
- Except it's not a playing card at all.

491
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,201
Now, in my experience,

492
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,846
playing cards don't contain
motor proteins and proprioceptors

493
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,121
and a neural net.

494
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,446
The responsible thing to do

495
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,966
would be to get this back
to its rightful owner.

496
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,845
Is there any way to track him down?

497
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,082
Well, if you tell me the truth
about where you got it from,

498
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,651
that could speed along the process.

499
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,080
I did tell you the truth.

500
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,002
I did. Now, tracking the owner?

501
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,288
You see this ink here,
for lack of a better word?

502
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,211
<i>It's magnetite, which is
the key component to tattoo ink.</i>

503
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,606
- You don't say.
- I do.

504
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,168
I also say that magnetite happens to
guide the internal compass of birds,

505
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,600
specifically homing pigeons.

506
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,327
So is it possible to use the magnetite
in the card to get a location on our, um,

507
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,607
D0ker player?

508
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:48,128
Theoretically. Though, if your
hypothetical poker opponent

509
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,722
has a deck full of these cards,
he'll probably be able to find you faster.

510
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,724
Curtis, we have to...

511
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,010
I'm gonna make you two a deal.

512
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,644
The first one to tell me
where you can find the Green Arrow

513
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,331
gets to live.

514
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,085
- Green Arrow?
- I have a better idea.

515
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,611
Run!

516
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,446
Ms. Smoak, I really need to know
what's going on here.

517
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,131
Does the board of directors know
there's a secret elevator in the building?

518
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,729
- Since when are you such a bad ass?
- Since always.

519
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,485
- Okay, I have multiple questions.
- Okay.

520
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,682
Obviously, there's
a very long explanation to this.

521
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,649
The short version is that
I work with the Green Arrow.

522
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,087
This man is trying to kill me,
well, us, sorry.

523
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,408
And I'm taking us down to the
only place that we're gonna be safe.

524
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,722
- The lobby?
- Not exactly.

525
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,365
You have a hidden floor.

526
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,046
We should be safe here, but just in case.

527
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,362
I think I know
where I can find the Green Arrow.

528
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,040
Which means that offer
about not killing you is off the table.

529
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,248
Stay here, do not move.

530
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,602
- You know how to use that thing?
- No.

531
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,802
Curtis? Curtis?

532
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,611
- Felicity?
- I'm here. I'm here. I'm okay.

533
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,801
What happened?

534
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,850
Your meta came back
to retrieve his ace of spades.

535
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,129
And you fended him off?

536
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,651
Don't sound so surprised.

537
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,520
Okay, I had a little bit of help
from a co-worker, but to be honest,

538
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,603
- he was more freaked out than I was.
- Is he all right?

539
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,330
Yes, he's fine.
I sent him to Starling General.

540
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,409
And he only knows about my secret,
not yours.

541
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,766
If he can trace the cards back here,

542
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,007
can we use the cards to trace back to him?

543
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,248
That is exactly what Curtis,
my freaked-out co-worker,

544
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,005
was doing when...

545
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,760
I got something.

546
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,846
He's headed for the Star City expressway.

547
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,963
Probably hightailing his way
back to Central City.

548
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,685
Too bad he's not gonna make it.

549
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,364
I will see you all dead
before I let you do this.

550
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,724
Laurel, please. Don't.

551
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,924
Are you sure you wanna do this?

552
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,211
Just keep going.

553
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,451
Wait, what's wrong?

554
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,524
I told you.
The Pit has never been used for...

555
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,051
No, wait.

556
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,526
Look.

557
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,640
Sara?

558
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,880
Hold her!

559
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,928
Sara! Sara!

560
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,320
Sara, it's okay.

561
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,085
<i>You're gonna be okay.</i>

562
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,927
It's okay. It's okay.

563
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,123
You guys are a special kind of stupid.

564
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,282
I was gonna blow town, call it a draw.

565
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,608
Not until you tell us about your employer.

566
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:49,122
Where's H.l.V.E.?
Who's behind the Ghosts? Tell me!

567
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,124
You know what your problem is?

568
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,567
You don't scare me
half as much as he does.

569
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,846
Look out!

570
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,644
- You okay?
- Yeah. Kevlar held.

571
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,245
You took a bullet for me.

572
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:25,171
They were meta-human tattoo playing cards.

573
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,684
Still counts, Oliver. Still counts.

574
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,770
To OTA.

575
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,524
Original Team Arrow.

576
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,524
Sorry. I know you hate it
when I call us that.

577
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,006
It's growing on me.

578
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,089
Cisco has our meta in lockup
at Iron Heights.

579
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,204
Yeah. We still can't get any intel.
He's too afraid of Damien Darhk.

580
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,249
So am l.
What are the odds that Double Down

581
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,851
told Darhk about Lair 2.0?

582
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:01,044
Enough that we should start
thinking about Lair 3.0.

583
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,931
I've been working on something.

584
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,526
- Really?
- Yeah.

585
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,889
Thought you would've learned your lesson
about keeping secrets from friends.

586
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,805
It's not a secret.

587
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,884
It's a surprise.

588
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,290
You enjoyed that, didn't you?

589
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,800
Torturing that man.

590
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,565
You don't even know what his name is.

591
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,643
- Walk faster.
- Elias.

592
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,451
That was his name, Elias.

593
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,405
- Faster.
- I'm in no rush to get to my death.

594
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,041
I'm trying to put some distance
between us.

595
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,570
- Between us and Richards?
- No. Between us and...

596
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,571
Between us and the landmine.

597
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,084
Listen to me. lam not going to kill you.

598
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,162
But you need to trust me,
or we're both dead. Do you understand?

599
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,164
- Yes.
- Okay.

600
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,680
Hey-

601
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,480
You Okay?

602
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,684
Well, the only thing wounded
is my workspace.

603
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,363
Oh, and if Mr. Dennis asks,

604
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,602
please just tell him
that all this happened

605
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:18,124
because an experiment I was running
had an unforeseen outcome.

606
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,485
Thank you for not letting him know

607
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,205
that there is a secret lair
in the basement.

608
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,210
I'm a full service employee.

609
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:29,605
You seem pretty calm for a guy
who nearly got killed by a meta-human.

610
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,885
Ms. Smoak, I came to Palmer Tech

611
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,043
so I can help make this city
a better place.

612
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,569
Can you even imagine how excited I am

613
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,167
to know that my boss
is doing exactly that?

614
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,884
Well, you really helped out, Curtis.

615
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,643
The Green Arrow...
We couldn't have done it without you.

616
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,810
<i>Ms. Smoak, is everything okay?</i>

617
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,200
I don't know.

618
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,606
It's okay.

619
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,482
Everything's gonna be okay.

620
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,049
Dad's not gonna believe it.

621
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,362
He's gonna be so happy when he sees you.

622
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,565
- Laurel?
- It's fine.

623
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,966
The same thing happened to you
when you first came out of the Pit.

624
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,170
She's just taking longer.

625
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,841
- It's probably because she was...
- Laurel, we are in uncharted waters here.

626
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,691
I suggest you prepare yourself
for the worst.

627
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,162
My liege, something has happened.

628
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,486
What have you done?

629
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,322
My father was not a trusting man.

630
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,885
He devised means to destroy the Pit

631
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,611
should its powers
fall into the wrong hands.

632
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,041
Like yours.

633
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,202
Nyssa, why would you
do something like this?

634
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,047
How can you even look at your sister
and ask me that?

635
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,887
One day, I will have my moment,

636
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,090
and I will kill you.

637
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,526
And now when I do,

638
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,522
there will be no coming back.

639
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,051
Take her!

640
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,406
I warned you, Laurel. I begged you.

641
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,771
What happened to Sara last year
was on Malcolm's hands.

642
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:38,721
But what's happening to her now
is on yours.

643
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,321
