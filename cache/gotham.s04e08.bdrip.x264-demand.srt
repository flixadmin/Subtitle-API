(GROANS)

481
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,311
You know what you've done?
Firefly is Penguin's enforcer.

482
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,796
And who is the one that
got Firefly down here, Cherry?

483
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,510
She informed on Ed to Penguin.

484
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,360
What?

485
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,113
(PANICKED CHATFERING)

486
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,760
Shut up.

487
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,400
Shut up.

488
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,037
This is my club, it's my turf.

489
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,950
You guys just do what you're told
like the scum you are.

490
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,717
They're the ones that are the problem.

491
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,273
They work for Penguin.

492
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,395
CROWD: Oh!

493
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,959
Iwould like to announce
that we just quit working for Penguin.

494
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,194
(ALL CHEERING)

495
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,229
Whoo!

496
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,233
Well, they sure love their
cold-blooded murder down here, huh?

497
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,760
Yeah, well, we better split
before they decide they want more.

498
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,474
Hey, it's okay, big guy, Fire Lady,
she can't hurt you.

499
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,960
GRUNDY: Grundy safe.

500
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,870
Where were you, Harvey?

501
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,680
Hey, Jim.

502
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,274
I was just having a

503
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,200
little drinkie-poo.

504
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,115
Why don't you join me?

505
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,918
- Not right now.
- Come on, Jim,

506
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,638
don't be like that, come on, sit down

507
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,915
and have a drink with me.

508
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,199
Those cops were waiting for you.

509
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,351
Yeah, to spit in my face.

510
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:15,554
If that's what they wanted to do,
you owed it to them to be there.

511
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,952
You stand in front of them.
Look each one in the eye.

512
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,069
If you'd have done that.

513
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,912
Maybe you couldn've
gotten their respect.

514
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,399
I don't deserve their respect.

515
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,715
Jim, I shot Officer Patel,
what the hell was I supposed to do?

516
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,592
Stand in front of her and hand her
the bullet that I shot her with

517
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,795
that came from my gun?

518
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,915
That's the job.

519
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,759
Take responsibility for what happens
to your cops, that's the job.

520
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,515
Oh.

521
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:57,473
So now,
you're telling me what thejob is?

522
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,720
Yeah.

523
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:11,437
Today, Jim, I just couldn't do the job.

524
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:19,389
S0 I sent you, because I knew you could.

525
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,315
It's not good enough.

526
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,680
Not today.

527
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,635
They needed you there.

528
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,554
Well, ain't nothing
that I can do about it now.

529
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,515
Y°U 90t a pen?

530
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,240
For what?

531
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,791
Harvey Bullock,
you are relieved of duty.

532
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:14,196
As of this moment, I'm assuming
the Captaincy of Gotham Central.

533
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,600
Well, well,

534
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,636
look who finally got
what he always wanted.

535
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,389
But what I'm wondering is,

536
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,632
what did you have to do to get it?

537
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:35,192
- AII I did was myjob, same as...
- Nothing in Gotham is free.

538
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,960
Captain Gordon.

539
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,873
You just better hope you can pay up
when your bill's due.

540
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,835
And it'Il come due.

541
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,035
Huh?

542
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,400
Now you try.

543
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,555
Ah. You've met Martin, I see.

544
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,432
Shh. He's practicing.

545
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,080
No, it's...

546
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,196
Upward, Martin, s0 that way you drive
the blade under the ribs

547
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,679
- and into the heart.
- Oswald.

548
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,476
Entirely theoretically speaking,
of course.

549
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,075
- Mr. Penn?
- Urgent matters, Mr. Cobblepot.

550
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:54,071
It seems that Miss Kean
and her associates have failed

551
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,559
to retrieve Mr. Nygma.

552
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,117
- Did you dispatch Firefly?
- I did.

553
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,990
And Ms. Firefly was herself
in turn, disabled.

554
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,120
(LOUDLY) What?

555
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,799
- There's more.
- Yes!

556
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,836
The mayor at his own discretion
has seen fit to promote

557
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,560
Detective Gordon to the rank of Captain.

558
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,760
That is, um...

559
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,035
That is quite alot
to go awry in one day.

560
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,117
Very good, Mr. Cobblepot.

561
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:43,240
You see. Oswald,
business is not the end-all of life.

562
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:47,279
There are other rewards to be had.
Companionship, peace of mind.

563
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,080
Friendship.

564
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,519
Oh. I have to get back to the estate,

565
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,256
I still have so much to do
for the fundraiser.

566
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,696
Will you be joining me later for dinner?

567
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,119
I think not.

568
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,554
- Martin needs some more practice.
- Okay.

569
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,880
Martin.

570
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,160
Remind me.

571
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,119
What did we learn today?

572
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,039
What did we learn about friendship?

573
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,200
Exactly.

574
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:33,157
Sometimes if you're not ven/ careful.
Friendship can blind you

575
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,914
to what is staring you
right in the face.

576
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,755
NYGMA: "Hey, Firefly.

577
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,520
"You're the only thing
that stinks around here."

578
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,477
I get melodramatic under pressure.

579
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,120
How are you feeling, big fella?

580
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,834
Grundy confused.

581
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,954
Yeah, tell me about it.

582
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,320
What's with them?

583
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,480
They're, uh...

584
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,040
They're acknowledging their new leader.

585
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,199
Well, like I said. they love you.

586
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,193
Uh, Lee, I'm supposed to be
the stupid one.

587
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,471
You heal their children,
you stitch up their warriors.

588
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,996
You've slain a fire breathing monster
and you've helped topple the queen.

589
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,275
This is your turf now.

590
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,229
No, no, no, I am not a leader.

591
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,256
Okay. well, if you don't do it,
somebody else will.

592
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,429
Probably worse than Cherry.

593
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,598
Where do I start?

594
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,593
I don't know, just make 'em happy,
give 'em something to cheer for.

595
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,314
Drinks on the house!

596
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,834
(ALL CHEERING)

597
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,480
Good move.

598
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,235
SOFIA: Why, Captain Gordon,

599
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,994
you came to celebrate after all.

600
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,915
I'm not here to celebrate.

601
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,114
What's wrong?
I made you captain, didn't I?

602
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,315
<i>You made me?</i>

603
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,115
Is that what you think?

604
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,920
Jim.

605
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,559
You can toy with Penguin all you want.

606
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,360
But I am not your puppet.

607
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,760
No, you're not. You're my partner.

608
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,560
Your partner?

609
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,190
Ijust stuck a knife
in my partner's back.

610
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,877
A mercy killing, if you ask me.

611
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Grow up.

612
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,994
You wanted a gangster to help you
get rid of Penguin.

613
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,957
This is what that help looks like.

614
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,197
Harvey had to go.

615
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,233
I don't need your help anymore.

616
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,351
I think it's time you left Gotham.

617
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,559
I'm not going anywhere, Jim.

618
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,035
I came to restore the Falcone name
and that's exactly

619
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,713
what I'm going to do.

620
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:55,873
So, do you want to come in
and celebrate, Captain?

621
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,714
I think I'II stay out here
where I can breathe.
