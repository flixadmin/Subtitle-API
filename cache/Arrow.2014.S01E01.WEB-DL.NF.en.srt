for doing the same things that I did?

-I never meant to...
-She was my sister.

188

I couldn't be angry
because she was dead.

Me too.

466
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,800
[BOTH LAUGH]

467
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:51,055
It looks like Starling City
has a guardian angel.

468
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:56,185
By the way, your cute friend's here.

469
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:05,778
You left the party quick last night,
even after I stocked the bar with Pinot Noir.

470
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,196
It wasn't really my scene.

471
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:11,242
I thought maybe you and Oliver
went mano-a-mano again.

472
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,785
I saw you two head out.

473
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:16,247
There's nothing between Oliver and I.
Not anymore.

474
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:19,876
And here I thought the only thing
between you and Oliver was us.

475
00:40:20,043 --> 00:40:24,047
I wouldn't characterize us
as an us, Tommy.

476
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:26,049
-Then what would you call it?
-A lapse.

477
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:30,678
It's quite a few lapses. Your place.
My place. My place again.

478
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:33,890
Come on, Merlyn.

479
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:36,726
We both know that
you're not a one-girl type of guy.

480
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:38,603
Depends on the girl.

481
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:41,940
I have to go back to work.

482
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,610
Dinah Laurel Lance.

483
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:48,613
Always trying to save the world.

484
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,866
Hey, If I don't try and save it, who will?

485
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:09,217
OLIVER:
<i>She says the island changed me.</i>

486
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:14,013
<i>She has no idea how much.</i>

487
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:18,142
<i>There are many more names on the list...</i>

488
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:22,313
<i>...those who rule my city
through intimidation and fear.</i>

489
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:28,277
<i>Every last one of them
will wish I had died on that island.</i>

490
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:41,082
The police failed to identify the men
I hired to kidnap Oliver.

491
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:43,001
And they never will.

492
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:47,088
-Should we arrange another abduction?
MOIRA: No.

493
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:51,175
There are other ways of finding out
what my son knows.
