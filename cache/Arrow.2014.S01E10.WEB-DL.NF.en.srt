I thought after six weeks
you'd be anxious to hood up.

156

"you gotta slow down" speech.

OLIVER:
Let me see what's going on upstairs.

159
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:33,711
TOMMY: There was supposed to be a delivery
this morning, another one this afternoon...

160
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,922
...and I see nobody ready for work.

161
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,800
If you don't get some progress here
in the next week...

162
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:41,760
...I'm gonna bring someone else in.
Is that clear?

163
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:44,222
It's difficult for you
to manage my nightclub...

164

...what with there not being
a nightclub here.

165
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,519
I just took the liberty
of, uh, yelling at our contractor.

166
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:53,356
I told him if we didn't see any real
progress, we'd bring someone else in...

167
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:56,025
-...to finish the job.

The one whose brother was a fireman?

Hanging in there, thanks.
That's something I wanted to bring up.

170
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,994
I was thinking that we could throw
a fundraiser for the Fire Department.

171
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,372
-Raise some money for the families.
-That's a great idea.

172
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:12,041
We could do it here.
We could keep the overhead low.

173
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,961
Make sure we maximize
the proceeds to the firemen.

174
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,672
Who are you?
Where's my friend Tommy Merlyn?

175
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,675
The guy who once rented out
a pro football stadium...

176
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:23,678
...so that he could play
strip kickball with models.

177
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:26,556
That guy needed a swift kick
in his lazy ass.

178

some time off.

you hit the books pretty hard.

Yeah, you probably shouldn't have.

-Then why did he give you his phone?

-He took it back.

to give you even a little closure...

...don't you wish they'd done it?

193

lying to the people closest to them, no.

198

...that the CEO of Queen Consolidated...

203
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,897
...has vanished
under mysterious circumstances.

204

I don't need you to remind me of that.

The last thing I wanna do is upset you.

-Ned Foster.

-The COO of the company.
-He wants Mom to take Walter's place.

210

has been damaged by Walter's absence...

the construction company who built it...

...used substandard materials
to save themselves a few bucks.

00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:17,467
-And I'll see you for dinner.
OLIVER: Mm-hm.

457
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:26,518
-What?
-Just feeling the whiplash.

458
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:30,230
She went from shut-in
to chairman pretty fast.

459
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:34,943
-Sounds like you got through to her.
-Yeah, I guess.

460
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:42,075
It'll just be for a few months.
My mom, she's taking it so hard.

461
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:44,828
Whatever you have to do
to take care of your family.

462
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,499
Before I forget.

463
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:57,048
My brother's badge.

464
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:08,268
My mom was hoping maybe you could find
a way to get it to, you know, him.

465
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:13,773
As a thank-you.
I don't care what anyone has to say.

466
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:18,445
He really is a guardian angel.

467
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:23,992
I'll find a way to get it to him.

468
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:31,040
I'm gonna miss you.

469
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,294
Yeah.

470
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,302
-Hey.
-Hey.

471
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:44,971
-You look after yourself, all right?
-I will.

472
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:46,514
Good.

473
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:52,771
So Joanna's taking
a leave of absence, huh?

474
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:56,900
-She has to go be with her family.
-Yeah, well, family's important.

475
00:37:57,525 --> 00:38:00,653
-I already apologized.
-It's my turn.

476
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,114
After what happened last night...

477
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:06,201
...maybe it's a good thing
you got the hood involved.

478
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,703
He didn't take the phone off you,
did he?

479
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:38,274
Maybe you should hold onto this.

480
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:44,280
I mean, I may not like the guy's methods,
but whoever this guy is...

481
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:48,576
...he's got a habit of putting himself
between danger and you.

482
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:50,954
And that's not something
I can argue with.

483
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:56,751
Besides,
I shouldn't have this thing anyway.

484
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:04,467
Kelton, are we good?

485
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:08,388
I got a strong signal from the crystal
VHF transmitter you hid in the speaker.

486
00:39:08,555 --> 00:39:11,432
-It can't be back-traced.
-Talk to me like a third grader.

487
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,768
Next time your daughter calls
the vigilante...

488
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:15,979
...we'll be able to listen to every word.

489
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:20,358
I know you swore
to bring this guy down, detective...

490
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:24,404
...but using your own daughter as bait,
that's stone cold.

491
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:30,159
[GRUNTING]

492
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:24,672
Good thing the fire didn't spread
to down here.

493
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:34,891
It's one of the benefits of concrete
and steel construction.

494
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:40,480
Thank you.

495
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:45,234
-What for?
-You know what for.

496
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:50,657
-So, what's next? More training?
-No.

497
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,994
We go hunting.
