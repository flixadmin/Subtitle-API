00:00:01,711 --> 00:00:03,189
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

2
00:00:03,213 --> 00:00:05,191
We have been looking
at that front page for four years.

3
00:00:05,215 --> 00:00:07,258
<i>And I'm the one
that writes that article, Barry.</i>

4
00:00:07,342 --> 00:00:09,260
My boss's husband is the Flash?

5
00:00:09,344 --> 00:00:10,344
Mmm-hmm.

6
00:00:10,345 --> 00:00:11,545
God. Nobody tells me anything.

7
00:00:11,596 --> 00:00:15,266
This substance appears to heal any
and all weaknesses in the human body.

8
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:16,601
I've learned to control it.

9
00:00:16,685 --> 00:00:18,436
This is my final masterpiece.

10
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,688
Life eternal.

11
00:00:19,771 --> 00:00:22,649
I've seen your version of life.
It's a nightmare.

12
00:00:22,732 --> 00:00:23,751
I want to show you this.

13
00:00:23,775 --> 00:00:25,151
I recognize that pin.

14
00:00:26,653 --> 00:00:28,133
I have a follow-up question.

15
00:00:54,305 --> 00:00:55,390
Whoo!

16
00:00:55,473 --> 00:00:56,850
That was quite the tumble.

17
00:00:57,517 --> 00:00:59,602
I guess you're wondering
why I'm doing this to you.

18
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:01,438
You're evil. I get it.

19
00:01:30,717 --> 00:01:33,136
I bet it's been a while since
you've felt your own mortality.

20
00:01:33,762 --> 00:01:36,890
But my powers, like yours,
work on a cellular level.

21
00:01:37,265 --> 00:01:38,641
Allow me to demonstrate.

22
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:54,657
You know, Iron Heights is gonna send me
a "thank you" basket

23
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,076
when I drop you off as a gift.

24
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:00,997
I've already given you a gift.

25
00:02:02,207 --> 00:02:05,794
And now... I'm gonna need it back.

26
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:21,851
My destiny is to heal all of mankind.

27
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,855
You and your friends can't be allowed
to prevent that.

28
00:02:26,564 --> 00:02:29,651
Life demands your death.

29
00:02:36,825 --> 00:02:37,825
Ralph!

30
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,538
Ralph! Ralph! Ralph, come on!

31
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,251
Give us a hand.

32
00:02:46,334 --> 00:02:47,710
- What happened?
- Ramsey.

33
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:51,339
Come on, Coach. We've still gotta
go on that road trip, right?

34
00:02:52,674 --> 00:02:53,674
He's gonna die.

35
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:56,719
- Frost, how do we save him?
- I don't know. I can't fix this.

36
00:02:57,887 --> 00:02:59,722
Uh, maybe Caitlin can.

37
00:03:06,396 --> 00:03:08,556
Ralph's elastic cells aren't mending
like they used to.

38
00:03:08,648 --> 00:03:09,983
Ramsey must be getting stronger.

39
00:03:10,525 --> 00:03:13,403
- So Ralph can't heal himself?
- No. But maybe you can.

40
00:03:13,486 --> 00:03:14,404
What?

41
00:03:14,405 --> 00:03:15,715
Your speed-healing is the only thing
we've seen

42
00:03:15,738 --> 00:03:17,138
that can repair damage this severe.

43
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:19,868
Maybe if we gave him
a blood transfusion, that would fix him.

44
00:03:19,951 --> 00:03:22,304
What are you saying?
I can give Ralph my speed-healing?

45
00:03:22,328 --> 00:03:24,205
Theoretically, temporarily, yes.
I don't know.

46
00:03:24,289 --> 00:03:26,183
We're sort of in uncharted
medical territory here.

47
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:29,127
But your blood type is O-negative,
so you're a universal donor.

48
00:03:30,503 --> 00:03:33,381
Guys, Ralph is elastic.
No needle can puncture through his skin.

49
00:03:35,258 --> 00:03:37,594
- I can phase him.
- Would that work?

50
00:03:39,888 --> 00:03:40,888
Do it.

51
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:43,765
- Got it?
- Yeah.

52
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:44,766
- Ready?
- Yeah.

53
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:01,701
Hey. How is he?

54
00:04:02,744 --> 00:04:05,663
He's stable, thanks to you.

55
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:08,583
We contacted A.R.G.U.S.
and they're gonna move Ralph

56
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:10,585
to a secure medical facility
for recovery.

57
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:14,255
Cisco and Caitlin are prepping
for transport right now.

58
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:18,718
Hey, don't worry, okay?
He's gonna pull through.

59
00:04:22,555 --> 00:04:23,681
It's not that.

60
00:04:25,683 --> 00:04:26,976
What if I hadn't been here?

61
00:04:28,686 --> 00:04:31,230
Ralph's fight was nothing compared
to what's coming.

62
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,150
Crisis is only two days away.

63
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:35,860
And we're all ready. I promise.

64
00:04:36,694 --> 00:04:38,947
Iris, if I haven't prepared the team...

65
00:04:39,697 --> 00:04:41,908
You have prepared us, Barry.

66
00:04:45,286 --> 00:04:48,206
Hey, don't let what happened
to Ralph fill you with doubt.

67
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:52,001
You've done the work. We're ready.

68
00:04:53,378 --> 00:04:54,379
For whatever comes next.

69
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:25,410
I'm gonna give you one chance
to turn yourself in.

70
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:30,206
Honestly, I hope you don't take it.

71
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,917
Well, there's no need
to involve the authorities.

72
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:34,292
I just want to talk...

73
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,840
Flash.

74
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:51,394
Of course. You're the Flash.

75
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,271
But how did...

76
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:55,439
When...

77
00:05:57,066 --> 00:05:58,568
You were struck by lightning.

78
00:05:59,652 --> 00:06:01,654
That is quite the origin story.

79
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,376
I don't know how you're doing this.

80
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:18,212
Real or not, I'm coming for you.

81
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:22,341
And yet, I'm not your foremost concern,
am I?

82
00:06:22,675 --> 00:06:25,344
Not as much as your inevitable demise
in a coming...

83
00:06:26,596 --> 00:06:27,596
Crisis?

84
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:30,308
Goodness, you really are
full of surprises, aren't you?

85
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:31,933
So, tell me.

86
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:37,148
When you saw all those permutations,
billions of possible futures,

87
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:38,649
all ending in your death...

88
00:06:41,444 --> 00:06:42,612
what role did I play?

89
00:06:44,864 --> 00:06:45,864
You didn't.

90
00:06:46,908 --> 00:06:47,992
You weren't there.

91
00:06:48,868 --> 00:06:50,953
Really? Not even in one?

92
00:06:51,537 --> 00:06:52,580
Huh.

93
00:06:53,206 --> 00:06:55,249
Then again,
you never saw this coming, did you?

94
00:06:55,792 --> 00:06:57,210
Frankly, neither did I.

95
00:06:58,086 --> 00:07:00,296
Makes one believe in the impossible,
doesn't it?

96
00:07:03,049 --> 00:07:04,258
You look scared.

97
00:07:05,093 --> 00:07:06,135
Well, you should be.

98
00:07:06,886 --> 00:07:10,723
After all,
it is the end of the world, isn't it?

99
00:07:44,966 --> 00:07:46,126
<i>What's that, Flash?</i>

100
00:07:46,634 --> 00:07:50,847
You think I should bust my boss
for keeping yet another secret from me?

101
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,515
Yeah. Me, too.

102
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:08,197
Drop what you're doing.
<i>The Citizen</i> has a new story.

103
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:10,533
Look at these.

104
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:15,580
- Where did you get those photos?
- I pulled them from a bow tie camera.

105
00:08:16,372 --> 00:08:17,850
Long story.
Look, the point is,

106
00:08:17,874 --> 00:08:20,835
this is the same guy
that kidnapped your cousin Esperanza

107
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:23,004
and turned her into a meta-assassin
against her will.

108
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:25,006
One of these photos, this one,

109
00:08:25,381 --> 00:08:27,175
shows our mystery man
getting out of his car.

110
00:08:27,258 --> 00:08:29,135
My dad traced his plates
and tracked the car

111
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:31,053
to a rented parking space
at a nearby lot.

112
00:08:31,596 --> 00:08:34,724
So, now all we have to do is wait
for him to show up.

113
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,351
Cool.

114
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:40,521
Just checking, are there any
other stories you want to work on first?

115
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:41,856
Wh...

116
00:08:41,857 --> 00:08:43,649
What could need our attention
more than this?

117
00:08:44,734 --> 00:08:46,444
Your cousin was a victim, Allegra,

118
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:48,327
and now some secret organization is
using her.

119
00:08:48,404 --> 00:08:50,964
- I mean, how many others are they using?
- We need to help them.

120
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,035
Right. I mean, no one...

121
00:08:54,118 --> 00:08:56,662
wants to find out what happened
to Esperanza more than me,

122
00:08:57,914 --> 00:09:00,666
but is this really what
matters the most to you... right now?

123
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:04,170
Yeah. Now, come on. Get your stuff.

124
00:09:04,587 --> 00:09:07,048
Kamilla is going to see
if she can recover any other photos.

125
00:09:07,131 --> 00:09:09,467
You and I have a stakeout date.

126
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:11,968
You're the boss.

127
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:16,015
Brain activity looks good.
No sign that you're going nuts.

128
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:17,265
And my blood work?

129
00:09:17,642 --> 00:09:20,561
CBC, metabolic rate, all normal...
for a speedster.

130
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:23,731
Just a small spike in cortisol.

131
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:25,542
Caity said that sleep monitor
on your wrist

132
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:27,486
will tell us if there's
anything seriously wrong.

133
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:30,363
But if you ask me,
you just had a nightmare.

134
00:09:31,447 --> 00:09:32,448
I don't know.

135
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:35,451
Ramsey seemed so real.

136
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:39,622
Something feels off.
I just can't put my finger on it.

137
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:49,341
Hi, there. My name is Iris West-Allen.
I'm with <i>The Citizen.</i>

138
00:09:49,632 --> 00:09:52,301
I was wondering if I could ask you
a few questions.

139
00:09:53,052 --> 00:09:54,095
Sorry. Not interested.

140
00:09:55,805 --> 00:09:57,932
Hi. Same paper. Same question.

141
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,392
What the hell is going on here?

142
00:09:59,934 --> 00:10:01,703
I don't have time for this.
I'm late for work.

143
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:03,062
Which is where, exactly?

144
00:10:03,938 --> 00:10:04,981
None of your business.

145
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,417
Okay, you know what? You're right.

146
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:10,778
We will just run our photos
without any comments.

147
00:10:12,697 --> 00:10:13,697
What photos?

148
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:21,914
You know what? I'm sure your employer
will love the free exposure.

149
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,084
- All right. Have it your way.
- Easy. I've got a taser.

150
00:10:25,835 --> 00:10:27,503
And I have a business card.

151
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:36,304
Transporting what, exactly?

152
00:10:36,846 --> 00:10:39,127
Whatever the wealthy would prefer
to keep under the radar.

153
00:10:39,432 --> 00:10:40,683
Specialty items, mostly.

154
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:42,810
That woman in a coma was
a government job.

155
00:10:43,728 --> 00:10:44,770
Meister's party, well...

156
00:10:45,396 --> 00:10:48,441
that was more like designated driving
for billionaires falling off the wagon.

157
00:10:49,317 --> 00:10:52,153
Today, it's priceless family jewels.

158
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:53,946
You're an Uber for the uber-rich.

159
00:10:54,322 --> 00:10:55,823
What I am is late.

160
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:58,701
Sorry to bother you. Thank you.

161
00:11:01,454 --> 00:11:02,997
- That was a bust.
- Yep.

162
00:11:03,456 --> 00:11:06,518
But the bright side is we have time for
other stories we might be putting off.

163
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:07,668
Got any in mind?

164
00:11:08,544 --> 00:11:11,464
You know, I don't know. I think there's
something that we missed.

165
00:11:11,881 --> 00:11:13,466
I don't want to move off of this yet.

166
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:01,722
Mom?

167
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,102
Is this another nightmare?

168
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:11,899
No, Barry. This is much, much worse.

169
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:26,622
- You're the Speed Force.
- Yes.

170
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,376
It's been a while since
we've talked like this.

171
00:12:32,087 --> 00:12:33,187
I've missed it.

172
00:12:34,547 --> 00:12:35,589
You need to help.

173
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,758
I don't understand
what's happening to me.

174
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:41,387
You used your blood
to save your friend's life,

175
00:12:42,555 --> 00:12:44,807
but in the process,
you've endangered your own.

176
00:12:47,393 --> 00:12:50,146
<i>A small amount of Ramsey's cells
remain from the attack.</i>

177
00:12:50,855 --> 00:12:52,022
<i>Hidden from the eye.</i>

178
00:12:54,442 --> 00:12:57,027
- Ramsey's infected me.
- More than you realize.

179
00:12:57,611 --> 00:13:01,407
Ramsey's sentience,
his very being, resides in his cells.

180
00:13:02,366 --> 00:13:04,076
That's how he knew I'm the Flash.

181
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:06,829
About Crisis.

182
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:11,667
If this...

183
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:16,380
If this is all in my mind,
then where's my real body?

184
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:20,217
After your friend Frost examined you,
you came back home.

185
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:24,346
<i>Dropped your keys in that bowl.
Poured a glass of water.</i>

186
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:26,849
<i>Then the infection took hold.</i>

187
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:34,398
As we speak, Ramsey's infection is
spreading through your body

188
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:35,899
and your mind.

189
00:13:36,609 --> 00:13:39,320
Your speed-healing is trying
to hold off his disease.

190
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:43,115
But ultimately,
it's up to you to resist him.

191
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:46,410
Is he trying to kill me?

192
00:13:47,286 --> 00:13:48,913
Worse, I'm afraid.

193
00:13:50,456 --> 00:13:52,917
He wants to take control of you
and bend you to his will.

194
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:56,420
Then he's gonna lose.

195
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:02,259
There must be something that points
to where Esperanza was taken.

196
00:14:02,343 --> 00:14:05,554
I don't know. Hospital records?
Or what about that auction photo?

197
00:14:05,638 --> 00:14:06,907
That mystery man was a dead end,

198
00:14:06,931 --> 00:14:09,850
but Barry did say that there were
a lot of shady people at that gala,

199
00:14:09,934 --> 00:14:12,228
so I don't know.
Maybe one of them might be a new lead.

200
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:16,148
Or we could talk about

201
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,983
how your husband is the Flash.

202
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:26,242
- How did you...
- Nash Wells told me.

203
00:14:26,325 --> 00:14:29,245
You're not gonna... Is this the story
that you've been trying to tell?

204
00:14:30,162 --> 00:14:33,457
Allegra, Barry's identity
cannot be exposed.

205
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:34,917
No, not that.

206
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:39,088
This.

207
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:41,632
You've been avoiding it all day.

208
00:14:43,676 --> 00:14:44,843
It's not time for that yet.

209
00:14:46,345 --> 00:14:49,473
Well, according to this,
it will be in two days.

210
00:14:49,557 --> 00:14:50,951
And call it a hunch, but I don't think

211
00:14:50,975 --> 00:14:52,575
you're planning to write it then,
either.

212
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:00,525
I ever tell you...

213
00:15:01,527 --> 00:15:03,904
why I wanted to be a reporter
in the first place?

214
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:07,116
It was because of your article
about the Streak.

215
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:18,752
You know, that was the first name
that I ever gave to the Flash.

216
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,924
Back then, I didn't even know
that he was Barry.

217
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:29,138
And back then, I was just
a troubled kid in Iron Heights.

218
00:15:29,221 --> 00:15:31,015
But your article...

219
00:15:32,016 --> 00:15:34,310
It made me believe in the impossible.

220
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,688
That maybe someday, I could be like you.

221
00:15:38,314 --> 00:15:41,483
Chasing stories, uncovering the truth.

222
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:44,153
You gave me hope when I had none.

223
00:15:46,238 --> 00:15:48,157
Just like you have
every day I've worked here.

224
00:15:50,242 --> 00:15:53,370
I don't know how you're gonna
bring yourself to write this article.

225
00:15:53,454 --> 00:15:54,455
I...

226
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:59,877
I just know you're never
going to forgive yourself if you don't.

227
00:16:12,598 --> 00:16:13,724
What's... How did I...

228
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:20,540
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

229
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:22,983
Allen, mmm, looks like we're both
back on our feet.

230
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:27,696
Babe, I'm glad you're feeling better.
Look. I made you a plate.

231
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,910
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm.

232
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:35,829
- Delicious.
- I'm all about these mashed potatoes.

233
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:38,499
I'm gonna need a second helping
of these beans.

234
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,584
That's both praise and a warning.

235
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,671
Uh-oh.

236
00:16:50,344 --> 00:16:51,344
This is wrong.

237
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:52,261
Mmm.

238
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:56,183
Everyone, I've got homemade lasagna.

239
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:16,412
Yum.

240
00:17:17,413 --> 00:17:18,413
Barry?

241
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:21,625
It's rude not to eat.

242
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,755
You're not Iris.
This isn't real.

243
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:30,509
I'm not gonna give in to you.

244
00:17:31,927 --> 00:17:33,637
Barry, you misjudge me.

245
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:36,724
I'm just here to enjoy supper
with good friends,

246
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:39,893
and, perhaps, offer you a gift.

247
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:42,938
What could you possibly offer me?

248
00:17:44,648 --> 00:17:45,649
Everything.

249
00:18:18,182 --> 00:18:22,102
Barry, you can't run away
from your own mind.

250
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:24,188
At least, not without considerable pain.

251
00:18:25,314 --> 00:18:28,042
Then again, you're always trying to run
away from your problems, aren't you?

252
00:18:28,985 --> 00:18:32,279
You've literally had a newspaper
warning of your demise,

253
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,157
and you've done nothing
to change your fate.

254
00:18:36,617 --> 00:18:39,828
It's almost like you want
to make Iris a widow.

255
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:41,330
Shut up!

256
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,971
This isn't real.

257
00:19:05,521 --> 00:19:06,897
These deaths were real.

258
00:19:19,952 --> 00:19:21,954
None of them had to die.

259
00:19:22,955 --> 00:19:26,124
Join me and you'll never have to.

260
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:00,784
Nora.

261
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:05,621
Hey.

262
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:16,899
Please, let me hold her.

263
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:19,803
I know it's not real. I just...
Please. I just want to pretend.

264
00:20:19,887 --> 00:20:22,556
Please. Just for a second.
I just want to...

265
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:24,182
Please. I want to hold my baby.

266
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,184
That's not my choice, Barry.

267
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:28,645
Why are you showing this to me?

268
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:31,667
<i>I'm not showing you anything.</i>

269
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:35,485
<i>All of this is coming from you.</i>

270
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:38,947
No, it's not. No, it's not.
No, it's not.

271
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,325
<i>Look deep within, Barry Allen.</i>

272
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,202
<i>This is your mind, your visions.</i>

273
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:46,038
<i>Your doubt.</i>

274
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,584
We all die without you.

275
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:56,465
You leave me alone forever.

276
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:03,513
Your city will burn.

277
00:21:07,225 --> 00:21:08,810
She's even faster than ever.

278
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:16,068
The Negative Speed Forces were too much,
even for me.

279
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:20,364
And now, Barry, everyone is dead.

280
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:28,497
It doesn't have to be like this, Barry.
Here. Let me show you.

281
00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:36,672
Accept my lifeblood,

282
00:21:36,755 --> 00:21:40,300
and you could use it to achieve
so much more than I ever could.

283
00:21:57,776 --> 00:22:00,612
Become a hero
beyond your wildest dreams.

284
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:35,147
The power to strike down death.
Life eternal.

285
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:38,608
The grand miracle at your command.

286
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:42,487
Save the world and live.

287
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:46,241
Have all you want.

288
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:08,764
She's so beautiful.

289
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:13,685
<i>Embrace it, Barry.</i>

290
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:16,813
<i>Just confess the truth.</i>

291
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:19,983
<i>Do you have doubts?</i>

292
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:22,359
I do.

293
00:23:23,612 --> 00:23:25,238
It's a beautiful life, Barry.

294
00:23:26,364 --> 00:23:29,284
All you have to do is choose it.

295
00:23:38,376 --> 00:23:39,586
Choose life.

296
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:02,858
Barry.

297
00:24:04,528 --> 00:24:05,821
You must gather your strength.

298
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:08,198
Focus.

299
00:24:09,533 --> 00:24:10,867
Time is running out.

300
00:24:19,835 --> 00:24:21,920
Thought you all
would want to see this.

301
00:24:23,004 --> 00:24:26,842
Witnesses heard the explosion,
but didn't see much else.

302
00:24:27,175 --> 00:24:30,554
There's gotta be at least half a dozen
cameras covering this lot, I...

303
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:34,307
And not one of them caught
anyone entering or exiting the scene

304
00:24:34,391 --> 00:24:36,017
when this all went down.

305
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,520
It's like a ghost did this.

306
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:46,570
So, the guy you questioned was killed
in the same lot you questioned him,

307
00:24:47,028 --> 00:24:48,613
- on the same day.
- Yeah.

308
00:24:49,156 --> 00:24:50,615
Uh, it gets worse.

309
00:24:51,408 --> 00:24:53,368
This blew away from the scene.

310
00:24:53,743 --> 00:24:55,537
I thought about turning it in
to the cops,

311
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,540
but I only saw it 'cause there's a major
UV energy coming off this thing.

312
00:24:58,623 --> 00:24:59,916
You can see that?

313
00:25:01,585 --> 00:25:04,880
Boss, this really feels like a job
for your husband's friend.

314
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:08,550
Oh, no, Kamilla knows
that Barry is the Flash.

315
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:10,092
Seriously?

316
00:25:11,344 --> 00:25:14,681
- Since when?
- Last summer. Cisco used to be Vibe.

317
00:25:15,348 --> 00:25:20,353
Okay. Look, guys. I think this mystery
goes a lot deeper than we thought.

318
00:25:21,062 --> 00:25:22,272
And it's a lot more dangerous.

319
00:25:23,023 --> 00:25:26,735
- So, if you guys wanna walk away...
- Not a chance.

320
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:28,612
That makes two of us.

321
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:33,450
Well, boss, looks like
Team Citizen has a new mission.

322
00:25:47,214 --> 00:25:49,925
It's okay, Barry. I'm here.

323
00:25:51,301 --> 00:25:53,386
I'm sorry it took me so long
to find you.

324
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:57,682
Ramsey's infection is stronger
than anything we've ever faced.

325
00:25:58,808 --> 00:26:00,310
And it's only getting stronger.

326
00:26:08,818 --> 00:26:10,195
I think I know why.

327
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:14,490
You feel doubt?

328
00:26:16,952 --> 00:26:17,952
I do.

329
00:26:19,287 --> 00:26:20,914
You've answered our call before.

330
00:26:21,998 --> 00:26:23,333
It's always been difficult.

331
00:26:24,542 --> 00:26:25,585
What's changed?

332
00:26:27,587 --> 00:26:28,964
I've lived more.

333
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:35,220
I've gotten married.
I've seen a future where...

334
00:26:36,972 --> 00:26:41,268
I'll have a daughter who's the best
of me and Iris combined.

335
00:26:45,105 --> 00:26:48,024
Most of my life has been
driven by my past, but...

336
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:54,447
but now it finally feels like
I'm living for myself.

337
00:26:57,575 --> 00:26:59,286
I don't wanna leave my family.

338
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:02,789
Or my friends.

339
00:27:06,376 --> 00:27:07,836
I don't wanna die.

340
00:27:11,172 --> 00:27:12,507
I know that's selfish.

341
00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:17,762
I'm sorry I let you down.

342
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:22,350
Barry, no person is immune
to fear and doubt.

343
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:25,020
No matter how brave.

344
00:27:26,062 --> 00:27:27,939
That's what makes you human, Barry.

345
00:27:29,858 --> 00:27:34,321
But the courage to move forward
even in the face of overwhelming odds?

346
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:37,198
That's what makes you a hero.

347
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:40,535
That's what makes you the Flash.

348
00:27:44,748 --> 00:27:45,790
Thank you.

349
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:49,002
I needed to hear that.

350
00:27:52,797 --> 00:27:53,965
Don't blame yourself.

351
00:27:56,217 --> 00:27:57,344
His lies...

352
00:27:59,763 --> 00:28:02,849
they were so convincing.

353
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:06,936
That's because he never lied.

354
00:28:10,774 --> 00:28:11,858
What do you mean?

355
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:15,820
That's what makes Ramsey so dangerous.

356
00:28:17,238 --> 00:28:20,116
He manipulates the truth
to spread his disease.

357
00:28:23,078 --> 00:28:24,078
What? So...

358
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:30,877
So the part about his cells allowing me
to save the world from Crisis...

359
00:28:32,587 --> 00:28:35,131
and still survive is true?

360
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:37,092
Yes.

361
00:28:38,676 --> 00:28:41,846
- But that path's not for you.
- Why not?

362
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:45,016
Barry, you must understand.

363
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,310
That you want me to leave behind
everyone I love

364
00:28:47,394 --> 00:28:48,895
when there's a way to save me?

365
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:57,820
What is it?

366
00:28:58,071 --> 00:28:59,989
It's Barry's sleep monitor.
This can't be right.

367
00:29:00,073 --> 00:29:01,116
His vitals are spiking.

368
00:29:03,243 --> 00:29:05,870
Barry, your fever is rising.
You must calm down.

369
00:29:05,954 --> 00:29:07,372
Stop telling me what to do!

370
00:29:14,212 --> 00:29:16,673
- His temperature's burning up.
- Why isn't he speed-healing?

371
00:29:16,756 --> 00:29:18,133
I've seen this fever before.

372
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:23,513
He's being taken over. Right now.

373
00:29:30,645 --> 00:29:33,982
His temperature's rising. Could really
use some cold powers right about now.

374
00:29:34,065 --> 00:29:36,276
No, Ramsey's infection doesn't respond
to ice.

375
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:37,819
We need to treat him medicinally.

376
00:29:38,486 --> 00:29:40,280
Inserting ten cc's of naproxen sodium.

377
00:29:48,413 --> 00:29:53,835
All my pain, all my suffering has been
because of you.

378
00:29:53,918 --> 00:29:57,797
Because you would rather I be the Flash
than have anything that I want.

379
00:29:57,881 --> 00:30:01,593
Barry, please. I am not denying
the burden that you've carried.

380
00:30:01,676 --> 00:30:02,844
But the Speed Force has only

381
00:30:02,927 --> 00:30:05,472
ever tried to be a guide
on this path that you've chosen.

382
00:30:05,555 --> 00:30:08,141
A lightning bolt shot down
from the sky and struck me!

383
00:30:08,725 --> 00:30:10,310
I didn't choose this!

384
00:30:10,393 --> 00:30:16,065
You decided to change my life,
my family's life, my entire future.

385
00:30:17,358 --> 00:30:19,360
This was done to me.

386
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:24,490
We need help.

387
00:30:27,994 --> 00:30:29,329
Frost.

388
00:30:36,002 --> 00:30:39,088
Frost. Frost.

389
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:41,382
Hey, hey. Hey.

390
00:30:41,925 --> 00:30:43,593
Just breathe. Breathe.

391
00:30:45,553 --> 00:30:46,679
Just breathe.

392
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,890
Just breathe.

393
00:30:48,973 --> 00:30:52,977
Please understand. The role you play
is vital to the balance of all things.

394
00:30:53,061 --> 00:30:53,977
Oh, stop.

395
00:30:53,978 --> 00:30:57,023
There are universal forces at stake.
They must be protected.

396
00:30:58,024 --> 00:30:59,609
What about the rest of us?

397
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:05,114
She's right.
There are universal forces at stake.

398
00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:08,493
It's just a pity she doesn't consider
your life among them.

399
00:31:08,868 --> 00:31:12,205
Don't listen to him. He wants to possess
your form no matter the cost.

400
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:15,375
Cost? All those headstones.

401
00:31:16,626 --> 00:31:20,046
Those people are dead
because of my connection to you.

402
00:31:20,547 --> 00:31:22,966
How many times
do I have to suffer for you?

403
00:31:23,466 --> 00:31:25,260
When is it your turn to suffer?

404
00:31:34,352 --> 00:31:35,937
Do you even feel pain?

405
00:31:36,729 --> 00:31:40,275
No... at least not as you know it.

406
00:31:41,276 --> 00:31:42,485
How could it?

407
00:31:42,569 --> 00:31:46,281
The Speed Force isn't human. It doesn't
know what it means to be alive.

408
00:31:46,364 --> 00:31:48,199
To have a family. To love.

409
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,159
It only pretends.

410
00:31:50,243 --> 00:31:53,580
Ramsey's infection is twisting
your heart. You have to fight it, Barry.

411
00:31:53,663 --> 00:31:56,424
- These aren't your true feelings.
- What do you know about the truth?

412
00:31:56,874 --> 00:31:58,835
This isn't what you look like.

413
00:31:58,918 --> 00:32:00,878
This isn't my old bedroom. It's a trick.

414
00:32:01,838 --> 00:32:05,091
This is you manipulating me
so I'll do what you want.

415
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:07,010
That's not true. I care about you.

416
00:32:07,093 --> 00:32:08,970
All it cares about is using you.

417
00:32:09,053 --> 00:32:11,347
- Barry, you must listen to me.
- No, I don't!

418
00:32:12,056 --> 00:32:13,641
You're not my mom.

419
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:15,935
You're the reason I buried her.

420
00:32:31,492 --> 00:32:33,411
No!

421
00:32:49,135 --> 00:32:50,178
No.

422
00:32:57,977 --> 00:33:01,356
The Monitor, Thawne, the Speed Force.

423
00:33:01,856 --> 00:33:03,733
For too long, others have used you.

424
00:33:04,192 --> 00:33:06,027
Take command of your life.

425
00:33:09,947 --> 00:33:10,947
Forever.

426
00:33:31,552 --> 00:33:33,096
No. I'm sorry. I have to.

427
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:35,032
It's the only way to survive.

428
00:33:35,056 --> 00:33:37,433
We don't have much time
until he returns, Barry. Look at me.

429
00:33:37,892 --> 00:33:40,537
Accepting Ramsey's blood would
save your body from the coming Crisis,

430
00:33:40,561 --> 00:33:41,854
but not your soul.

431
00:33:41,938 --> 00:33:43,815
You would lose the best of you.

432
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:47,276
Your joy, your passion, your light...

433
00:33:47,735 --> 00:33:49,880
the part of you that Iris loves.

434
00:33:52,824 --> 00:33:55,368
Don't listen to it. It lies.

435
00:33:57,912 --> 00:33:59,664
Come on. Barry.

436
00:34:10,466 --> 00:34:11,968
Only you can defeat this, Barry.

437
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:14,220
The choice is yours.

438
00:34:29,819 --> 00:34:30,819
You beat it.

439
00:34:32,488 --> 00:34:36,325
Took me a while, but... yeah, I beat it.

440
00:35:09,442 --> 00:35:11,861
<i>"My name is Iris West-Allen,</i>

441
00:35:12,278 --> 00:35:16,824
<i>and I once met a young man,
a superhero who I called the Streak.</i>

442
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:20,995
<i>The world has come to know him
as the fastest man alive.</i>

443
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:24,248
<i>The Scarlet Speedster. The Flash.</i>

444
00:35:26,751 --> 00:35:30,505
<i>But no matter what title you choose
for him, he'll always be remembered</i>

445
00:35:30,588 --> 00:35:33,591
<i>as the protector of our amazing city
and its citizens.</i>

446
00:35:34,342 --> 00:35:36,052
<i>As a beacon of hope for us all.</i>

447
00:35:37,011 --> 00:35:41,390
<i>As the man who sacrificed himself
again and again so we could live.</i>

448
00:35:45,937 --> 00:35:47,777
<i>Today, we said goodbye to him.</i>

449
00:35:48,523 --> 00:35:52,276
<i>Not because he was taken,
but because he gave himself willingly.</i>

450
00:35:53,444 --> 00:35:58,407
<i>And in the end, that's what makes him
deserving of the greatest title of all."</i>

451
00:35:59,951 --> 00:36:00,951
"Hero."

453
00:37:00,303 --> 00:37:01,721
Mar Novu,

454
00:37:02,638 --> 00:37:06,100
you ran and ran across infinite Earths,
and now,

455
00:37:07,101 --> 00:37:08,811
you have nowhere left to run.

456
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:17,028
It was like... being back in prison,

457
00:37:17,612 --> 00:37:19,155
only locked up in my own mind.

458
00:37:20,406 --> 00:37:24,619
All the terror I felt,
the horrible things I saw,

459
00:37:25,912 --> 00:37:27,204
they were all there,

460
00:37:28,205 --> 00:37:32,335
buried deep inside me,
just waiting to come out the whole time.

461
00:37:33,252 --> 00:37:35,588
Took a lot to win.

462
00:37:36,756 --> 00:37:38,591
Everything that makes life worth living.

463
00:37:40,426 --> 00:37:41,426
Thank you.

464
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:44,972
You deserve some of the credit.

465
00:37:45,389 --> 00:37:48,851
It takes something special
to beat a sentient infection

466
00:37:48,935 --> 00:37:50,853
that not even speed-healing can cure.

467
00:37:52,897 --> 00:37:54,899
Well, it's not over yet,
so let's get back to work.

468
00:37:54,982 --> 00:37:57,860
Whoa, whoa... What do you mean?
What are you doing? Just get some rest.

469
00:37:58,235 --> 00:37:59,555
Iris is gonna be here any minute.

470
00:37:59,946 --> 00:38:02,657
Crisis will be here
in less than 36 hours.

471
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,909
We have to find Ramsey, stop him.

472
00:38:04,992 --> 00:38:06,752
Make sure there's still
a world left to save.

473
00:38:10,623 --> 00:38:12,917
And away he goes.

474
00:38:16,087 --> 00:38:17,505
You wanna talk about what happened?

475
00:38:20,383 --> 00:38:21,926
I already talked about it with Caity.

476
00:38:23,844 --> 00:38:25,680
Okay. What'd she say?

477
00:38:26,681 --> 00:38:30,351
With Crisis approaching,
we decided it would be best

478
00:38:30,434 --> 00:38:32,311
if she handles the medical emergencies.

479
00:38:32,812 --> 00:38:33,980
I'll take a back seat.

480
00:38:34,939 --> 00:38:35,982
And you're okay with that?

481
00:38:37,942 --> 00:38:39,527
It's what's best for the team.

482
00:38:51,372 --> 00:38:53,374
Hey. I got here as fast as I could.

483
00:38:55,209 --> 00:38:57,545
- How are you?
- Oh, I'm fine.

484
00:38:58,713 --> 00:39:01,007
- Really, I'm okay.
- Your husband had an infection.

485
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:05,594
It messed with his brain quite a bit,
but we handled it.

486
00:39:09,765 --> 00:39:14,020
Okay, well, just to be safe,
I am not leaving you again

487
00:39:14,103 --> 00:39:15,312
for the rest of the night.

488
00:39:22,987 --> 00:39:24,238
What you working on?

489
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:26,907
Just running some diagnostics.
Little maintenance.

490
00:39:27,908 --> 00:39:30,870
Why don't you ask Cisco? We could
go home, spend some time together.

491
00:39:30,953 --> 00:39:32,580
Why are you asking so many questions?

492
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:38,626
I don't know.

493
00:39:38,627 --> 00:39:44,259
You know, sometimes the reporter brain
in me has a mind of its own.

494
00:39:49,013 --> 00:39:52,183
I will let you get back to work.

495
00:40:06,739 --> 00:40:07,739
Hey, guys.

496
00:40:11,077 --> 00:40:12,244
That's not Barry.

497
00:40:25,758 --> 00:40:26,758
Careful.

498
00:40:30,513 --> 00:40:32,973
Hey. Barry.

499
00:40:36,143 --> 00:40:37,143
Hey.

500
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,480
Barr.

501
00:41:11,262 --> 00:41:13,222
Welcome, my Blood Brother.

502
00:41:21,188 --> 00:41:23,941
I am the world's salvation...

503
00:41:24,942 --> 00:41:28,487
come to save it from all that ails it.

504
00:41:29,864 --> 00:41:34,368
Soon, the entire world will embrace...

505
00:41:36,287 --> 00:41:37,621
Bloodwork!
